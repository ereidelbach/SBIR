        "abstract": "Abstract         THE USE OF LASERS AS A SURGICAL MODALITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED IN RECENT YEARS. LASERS OF VARIOUS WAVELENGTHS ARE SUITED FOR DIFFERENT SPECIFIC SURGICAL FUNCTIONS. CO2 (10.6 ) RADIATION HAS SMALL PENETRATION DEPTHS IN TISSUES. THIS LEADS TO HIGH SURFACE TEMPERATURES WHICH ARE DESIRABLE FOR TISSUE INCISION THROUGH EVAPORATION. ND:YAG LASERS (1.06 ) PROVIDE VOLUMETRIC TISSUE HEATING WHICH IS EFFECTIVE IN VASCULAR COAGULATION. IN THE TREATMENT OF TUMORS AND CANCEROUS TISSUES, CONCURRENT HEMOSTASIS AND INCISION ARE NECESSARY REQUIREMENTS FOR WIDESPREAD CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF LASERS AS SURGICAL TOOLS. THE SPECIFIC AIM OF THIS PROPOSED EFFORT IS DIRECTED TOWARDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW SURGICAL LASER SYSTEM CAPABLE OF PROVIDING THESE SIMULTANEOUS FUNCTIONS. THE SYSTEM HAS THE ADVANTAGES OF A SINGLE POWER SUPPLY AND ONE LASER HEAD. IT CAN PROVIDE THE ADDED FUNCTION OF CUTTING, WHICH ND-YAG ALONE CANNOT SUITABLY PERFORM. IT SHOULD ACCOMPLISH HEMOSTASIS OF VASCULAR REGIONS WHERE CO2 IS NOT ADEQUATE. IN ADDITION, AN IMPORTANT FEATURE IS ITS COMPATIBILITY WITH CONVENTIONAL QUARTZ FIBER OPTICS DELIVERY SYSTEM. SUCH A LASER WILL HAVE WIDESPREAD CLINICAL APPLICATIONS AND COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL. THIS RESEARCH EFFORT NATURALLY FALLS WITHIN THE REALM OF PROGRAM ACTIVITIES SPONSORED BY THE DIVISION OF CANCER TREATMENT, NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS PHASE I PROGRAM ARE TWO FOLD. (1) A COMPLETE DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF THE LASER SYSTEM CAPABLE OF DELIVERING THE NECESSARY POWERS AT 1.06 AND 1.9 WILL BE PERFORMED. (2) EXPERIMENTS WILL BE CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE TISSUE ABSORPTION AND INTERACTION CHARACTERISTICS AT 1.9 , THUS VERIFYING THE POWER LEVELS NECESSARY FOR INCISION. RESULTS FROM PHASE I WILL PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR A PHASE II PROGRAM TO FABRICATE THIS LASER AND CONDUCT IN VIVO ANIMAL EXPERIMENTS.",

NO OTHER EFFICIENT DIRECT LASING SOURCE IS AVAILABLE. TO OBTAIN SUCH A SOURCE, WE PROPOSE THE USE OF 1.06 MICROMETER (ND LASER) AND A COMBINATION OF RAMAN SHIFTING GASES SUCH AS HYDROGEN, HYDROGEN HALIDES AND THEIR ISOTOPIC MEMBERS. THIS APPROACH IS FEASIBLE DUE TO CURRENT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE EFFICIENCY OF ND ION LASING IN GGG HOST CO-DOPED WITH CR ION, AND THE DEMONSTRATED EFFICIENCY OF THE RAMAN SHIFTING PROCESS. THE KEY TO THE ATTAINMENT OF THE DESIRED WAVELENGTH BAND IS THE MAGNITUDE OF THE GAIN COEFFICIENTS OF THE PROPOSED HALIDE GASES. THE PRIMARY TASK OF THIS PHASE I EFFORT IS THE DEMONSTRATION OF POTENTIAL EFFICIENT CONVERSION IN THESE GASES. SYSTEM DESIGN FOR A PHASE II PROTOTYPE SYSTEM WILL ALSO BE CONDUCTED.",

OF THE AVAILABLE TECHNIQUES, MAMMOGRAPHY IS THE MOST WIDELY USED APPROACH FOR THE EARLY DETECTING OF THE PRESENCE OF A POTENTIAL TUMOR WORTHY OF FURTHER INVESTIGATION. MAMMOGRAPHY IS ONE OF THE MOST DEMANDING MEDICAL X-RAY TECHNIQUES. THIS IS BECAUSE IT DEALS WITH SOFT TISSUE STRUCTURES OF VERY LOW CONTRAST. THE MAMMOGRAM IMAGE MUST BE ABLE TO SHOW THE SOFT GLANDULAR TISSUE, CYSTIC OR SOLID TUMORS, AND THE FIBROUS STRANDS. IN ADDITION, IT MUST RESOLVE TINY MICROCALCIFICATIONS WHICH ARE MORE DENSE BUT OF VERY SMALL DIAMETER. IF THE EXPOSURE IS NOT CORRECT, THE FILM WILL NOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION AND THE IMAGE MUST BE RETAKEN AT A COST OF BOTH EXTRA MONEY AND SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL EXPOSURE TO THE PATIENT. TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF RETAKES AND TO OPTIMIZE IMAGE QUALITY, SOME NEW X-RAY MACHINES USE AUTOMATIC EXPOSURE CONTROLLERS. UNFORTUNATELY, THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF X-RAY MACHINES USED FOR MAMMOGRAPHY IN THE FIELD WHICH DO NOT HAVE AUTOMATIC EXPOSURE CONTROLLERS, AND ALTHOUGH SOME NEWER MACHINES HAVE INCORPORATED CONTROLLERS, THERE IS STILL ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT AS RETAKES ARE SOMETIMES REQUIRED. BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH PRESENT CONTROLLERS AND BECAUSE OF THE IMPORTANT BENEFITS OFFERED BY IMPROVED IMAGING, WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE THE USE OF A NEW, HIGHLY SENSITIVE SOLID-STATE X-RAY SENSOR AS THE BASIS FOR AN IMPROVED EXPOSURE CONTROLLER.

THE POWER NEEDED TO ACHIEVE A STABLE PLASMA EVOLUTION TO THE \"SECOND STAILITY REGIME\" USING HOT PARTICLES IS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED OVER PREVIOUS ESTIMATES BY THE THREE INGRE- DIENTS OF THE PRESENT APPROACH: (1) THE VOLUME OCCUPIED BY THE HOT ELECTRONS IS REDUCED; (2) MILD PLASMA CROSS-SECTION SHAPING IS USED TO REDUCE THE HOT ELECTRON REQUIREMENTS; AND (3) OPTIMIZED ECH TECHNIQUES DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE POWER NEEDED TO ACHIEVE A GIVEN HOT ELECTRON ENERGY DENSITY. STABLE, OPTIMIZED SCENARIOS WILL BE DETERMINED FOR THE EVOLUTION OF PRESSURE PROFILES AND PLASMA SHAPE FROM STARTUP TO A STEADY-STATE, HIGH-BETA REGIME.

TOC IS BASICALLY A PARAMETER USED IN INDUSTRY AND BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES (SPECIFICALLY THE EPA) TO MEASURE ORGANIC CONTENT ON A NON-SELECTIVE BASIS. THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THIS INVESTIGATION IS TO IDENTIFY OTHER END DETECTION AND/OR PRIMARY OXIDATION METHODS FOR QUANTITATIVE ORGANIC CONTENT MONITORING. STARTING WITH CURRENT COMMERCIAL UV/PERSULFATE OXIDATION - SPARGE - CO2 GAS DETECTION SYSTEM, OTHER TYPES OF CO2 DETECTORS FOR BOTH LIQUID AND GAS PHASES WILL BE EXAMINED. SECOND, THE OXIDATION SYSTEM WILL BE MODIFIED TO ENABLE THE USE OF ALTERNATE \"DELTA\" DETECTION DEVICES FOR MEASUREMENT OF CARBON OR OTHER ANALAGOUS PARAMETER (WHICH DIRECTLY REPRESENTS ORGANIC CONTENT) IN EITHER THE IONIC OR GASEOUS FORM. THE SECONDARY PURPOSE IS TO STUDY THE INTEGRATION OF ALL WATER QUALITY MONITORING SENSORS (FROM VARIOUS VENDORS) REQUIRED FOR LONG TERM SPACE FLIGHT INTO A SINGLE UNIT. THIS WILL ELIMINATE SAMPLE HANDLING SYSTEMS REPLICATION AND TRANSPORT TIME WHILE MINIMIZING VOLUME AND MASS REQUIREMENTS. INTEGRATION MAY TEND TO IMPROVE TOTAL SYSTEM RELIABILITY AND ACCURACY AS SOME SENSORS MAY OPERATE SYNERGISTICALLY OR ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR REDUNDANT MANUAL ANALYSIS.",

DIGITAL IMAGES PREPARED FROM CALIBRATED MICROPHOTOGRAPHS OF WHITE BLOOD CELLS, PLATELETS, AND RED CELLS, WILL BE USED TO REPRESENT THE OUTPUT OF THE CCD IMAGERS IN THE COMPUTER SIMULATION. THE SIMULATION WILL THEN BE USED TO DESIGN THE PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENT. PHASE I WILL ALSO INCLUDE THE STRUCTURING OF THE SIMULATED IMAGE DATA INTO PARAMETERS RELATED TO THE QUANTITY AND MORPHOLOGY OF CELL CONSTITUENTS (DNA, NUCLEAR SIZE AND SHAPE, HETEROCHROMATIN, CYTOPLASMIC VOLUME AND SHAPE, HEMOGLOBIN, SPECIFIC GRANULES, LYSOSOMES, AND RNA). SOFTWARE WILL THEN BE DEVELOPED AND EXPLORED FOR USING THESE PARAMETERS TO CLASSIFY AND DESCRIBE BLOOD CELLS. THE PARAMETERS WILL THEN BE USED TO GUIDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF CELL ANALYSIS SOFTWARE. THE TECHNIQUE OF COMPUTER SIMULATION SHOULD VERY SIGNIFICANTLY AID IN SPEEDY PRODUCTION OF A FUNCTIONING PROTOTYPE ADM IN PHASE II. THE ADM WILL REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT ADVANCE IN BLOOD CELL IMAGING BECAUSE OF ITS HIGH RESOLUTION AND SENSITIVITY THAT CAPITALIZE ON A QUANTITATIVELY INTERPRETABLE SPECIMEN. THE ADM WILL EXPAND THE DATA BASE DESCRIBING NORMAL AND ABNORMAL (INCLUDING NEOPLASTIC) BLOOD AND BONE MARROW CELLS, PROVIDING QUANTITATIVE DIAGNOSTIC PARAMETERS THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THE FIRST LEVEL DESIGN GOAL IS, HOWEVER, TO PROVIDE ALL OF THE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE HEMATOLOGIC TESTS MADE ON BLOOD CELLS IN A COMPLETELY AUTOMATED MODE. THE ADM WILL BE EXTREMELY COST-EFFECTIVE. IT WILL PERFORM ALL THE TESTS DONE ON BLOOD CELLS IN THE CLINICAL HEMATOLOGY LABORATORY AT LEAST AS FAST AND IN MORE DETAIL THAN CURRENT INSTRUMENTATION. THE ADM WILL BE CAPABLE OF THE DIAGNOSTIC DISCRIMINATION OF BLOOD CELLS, AND WILL BE EASILY ADAPTED TO THE UTILIZATION OF MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES IN CELL IDENTIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION. THESE FACTORS SHOULD STIMULATE COMMERCIAL INTEREST.",

STATE-OF-THE-ART SO2 SCRUBBING TECHNOLOGY, CENTERED AROUND LIQUID/GAS CONTACTORS, IS EXPENSIVE AND HAS OPERATIONAL DRAWBACKS. A NEW TECH- NOLOGY TO BE STUDIED HERE RELIES ON USING SO2-PERMEABLE MEMBRANES TO REMOVE SO2 FROM STACK GASES. THE MEMBRANE TECHNOLOGY COULD OVERCOME OPERATIONAL PROBLEMS OF LIQUID/GAS CONTACTORS SUCH AS LIQUID ENTRAINMENT IN THE GAS PHASE, CONTAMINATION OF THE LIQUID PHASE WITH FLY ASH, AND LIQUID FLOODING AND CHANNELING AT HIGH AND LOW LIQUID FLOWS, RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, PRELIMINARY COST ESTIMATES PLACE THE CAPITAL COST OF THE MEMBRANE SYSTEMS WELL BELOW THAT OF CONVENTIONAL PACKED TOWERS CURRENTLY USED IN GAS SCRUBBING, EVEN WHEN THE MEMBRANE SYSTEM IS USED TO ACHIEVE A MUCH HIGHER QUALITY (LOWER SO2) STACK GAS. PHASE I IS AIMED AT DEMONSTRATING THE MEMBRANE TECHNOLOGY ON A LABORATORY SCALE USING SYNTHETIC STACK GAS. IF SUCCESSFUL, PHASE I WILL FORM THE BASIS FOR PHASE II WHICH WILL FIELD- TEST THE TECHNOLOGY ON A REALISTIC SCALE.",

THE DETECTION SENSITIVITY OF THIS SYSTEM IS 274 PICOGRAM, WHICH IS SUFFICIENT TO DETECT SINGLE COPY GENES IN HUMAN DNA. THE AIM OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO TEST THE APPLICABILITY OF BIOTECH'S SYSTEM FOR DIAGNOSTIC USE IN CLINICAL LABORATORIES AND TO PRODUCE AND MARKET VIRAL DIAGNOSTIC KITS USING THE DERIVED METHODOLOGIES. SINCE DNA HYBRIDIZATION CAN BE UP TO 1,000 TIMES MORE SENSITIVE FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF VIRAL INFECTIONS THAN AVAILABLE IMMUNOLOGICAL TECHNIQUES, IT HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR WIDE APPLICATION IN THE CLINICAL DIAGNOSTICS MARKET. THE MAJOR DRAWBACKS IN USING THE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE RADIOACTIVE PROBES IN CLINICAL LABORATORIES, INCLUDING HIGH COSTS, PROBE INSTABILITY, EXPOSURE HAZARDS, AND WASTE DISPOSAL COULD BE ELIMINATED BY SUBSTITUTING THE NONRADIOACTIVE PROBE SYSTEM DESCRIBED HERE. PHASE I WOULD BE USED TO TEST THE NONRADIOACTIVE PROBES FOR THE ABILITY TO DETECT HTLV-III DNA AND RNA IN CULTURED HUMAN CELLS. PROCEDURES FOR EXTRACTING AND IMMOBILIZING THE NUCLEIC ACIDS FROM INFECTED CELLS, AS WELL AS FOR THE HYBRIDIZATION AND DETECTION OF THE DNA PROBES WILL BE OPTIMIZED. SIMPLIFIED PROTOCOLS SUITABLE FOR USE BY CLINICAL LABS WILL THEN BE ESTABLISHED. THE METHODOLOGIES DEVELOPED IN PHASE I WILL BE FURTHER EXTENDED TO PRODUCE, OBTAIN FDA APPROVAL FOR, AND MARKET DIAGNOSTIC KITS FOR THE DETECTION OF HTLV-III USING DNA PROBES. THESE KITS WOULD BE VALUABLE FOR DIAGNOSING PATIENTS WITH AIDS OR PRE-AIDS, AND COULD ALSO BE USED TO SCREEN BLOOD BANKS PRIOR TO USE IN BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS. THE NONRADIOACTIVE PROBE TECHNOLOGY WILL EVENTUALLY BE APPLIED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF DIAGNOSTIC KITS FOR OTHER VIRUSES (HERPES SIMPLEX, CYTOMEGALOVIRUS), CANCER DIAGNOSIS, AND GENETIC SCREENING.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THE RESEARCH APPLICATION IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE POTENTIAL OF THE DERMAPATCH DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEM DEVELOPED BY BIOTEK FOR THE TRANSDERMAL DELIVERY OF THERAPEUTIC AGENTS. THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE IS TO ILLUSTRATE THIS POTENTIAL BY TESTING IN LIVING ANIMALS A DERMAPATCH FOR THE DELIVERY OF LEVONORGESTREL AND ESTRADIOL WHICH COMPRISE TWO MAJOR BIRTH CONTROL STEROIDS. THE DERMAPATCH TRANSDERMAL DELIVERY SYSTEM RELEASES THE DRUG FROM RATE CONTROLLING MICROPARTICLES (MICROCAPSULES AND/OR MICROSPHERES) WHICH ARE SUSPENDED IN A DERMATOLOGICALLY ACCEPTABLE VISCOUS LIQUID BASE. THE MICROCAPSULES RELEASE THE DRUG IN ZERO ORDER AND MAINTAIN A THERMODYNAMICALLY STABLE LIQUID BASE. RELEASE IS CONTROLLED BY MICROCAPSULE SIZE AND THICKNESS OF THE CAPSULE WALL. THE MICROCAPSULES ALSO PREVENT DOSE DUMPING CAUSED BY ACCIDENTAL RUPTURE OF THE MEMBRANE. ANOTHER IMPORTANT FEATURE OF THE SYSTEM IS A MACROPOROUS MEMBRANE WHICH DELIVERS A THIN LIQUID FILM OF THE VEHICLE TO THE SURFACE OF THE SKIN TO OCCLUDE THE SKIN. THE FILM FORCES HYDRATION OF THE STRATUM CORNEUM WITH WATER FROM THE LOWER LAYERS OF THE EPIDERMIS AND ACCELERATES THE DELIVERY OF THE STEROIDS. BECAUSE OF THE INTIMATE CONTACT BETWEEN THE SKIN SURFACE AND THE THERMODYNAMICALLY STABLE VISCOUS LIQUID BASE UNIFORM DELIVERY OF THE DRUG IS INSURED THROUGHOUT THE TREATMENT PERIOD. IN PRELIMINARY IN VITRO STUDIES WITH THE DERMAPATCH WE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE PERMEATION OF LEVONORGESTREL AND ESTRADIOL FROM THE SYSTEM IS CONSTANT AND SUSTAINED (FIGURE 1). WE FURTHER DEMONSTRATED THAT THE PERMEATION RATES OF THE DERMAPATCH IN FRESHLY EXCISED MOUSE SKIN SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEED THE MINIMUM 30 UG/DAY CONTRACEPTIVE DOSE FOR LEVONORGESTREL. DETAILS ARE PRESENTED IN SECTION C. OUR INITIAL OBJECTIVE IS TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL DATA IN VITRO AND IN VIVO ON LEVONORGESTREL AND ESTRADIOL PERMEATION. THIS INFORMATION COULD LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A DERMAPATCH WHICH COMBINES BOTH HORMONES AS A BIRTH CONTROL METHOD FOR ONCE-DAILY APPLICATION. A DERMAPATCH OF LEVONORGESTREL AND NATURAL ESTRADIOL WILL MAKE AN EXCELLENT ALTERNATIVE TO ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES COMPOSED OF A PROGESTAGEN AND THE POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS SYNTHETIC, ETHINYL ESTRADIOL. THE TRANSDERMAL DELIVERY OF CONTRACEPTIVE STEROIDS OFFERS SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES FOR THE USER IN TERMS OF FLEXIBILITY, POTENTIAL REDUCED DOSAGE, AND REDUCED SIDE EFFECTS.",

RDS IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF NEONATE MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY. IT IS DUE TO INADEQUATE LEVELS OF LUNG SURFACTANT, A LIPID-PROTEIN COMPLEX ESSENTIAL FOR LUNG INFLATION. CURRENT DIAGNOSTIC ASSAYS ARE BASED ON THE LIPID COMPONENT OF SURFACTANT AND ARE UNRELIABLE. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A SENSITIVE AND ACCURATE ENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOADSORBENT ASSAY DIRECTED AGAINST THE MAJOR PROTEIN COMPONENT OF SURFACTANT. RDS IS NOW TREATED WITH A RESPIRATOR UNTIL SURFACTANT DEVELOPS, YET THIS OFTEN LEADS TO LUNG DISORDERS. NATURAL SURFACTANT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY ADMINISTERED AS A THERAPY BUT LIMITED AVAILABILITY MAKES THIS APPROACH IMPRACTICABLE FOR ROUTINE THERAPY. RECOMBINANT DNA TECHNOLOGY WILL BE USED TO PRODUCE THE NEEDED SURFACTANT PROTEIN. THE HUMAN GENE ENCODING THE PROTEIN WILL BE CLONED AND EXPRESSED, AND THE APOPROTEIN CONSTITUTED WITH LIPIDS TO PROVIDE A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE THERAPY.",

WHILE A VARIETY OF APPROACHES CURRENTLY EXIST FOR CONTROLLING HYPERTENSION, MANY PATIENTS COULD BENEFIT FROM NEW ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS THAT ARE MORE SPECIFIC THAN THOSE PRESENTLY AVAILABLE. RENIN INHIBITORS CONSTITUTE A POTENTIAL CLASS OF HIGHLY ACTIVE YET SPECIFIC ANTIHYPERTENSIVE AGENTS. ONE IMPEDIMENT TO THE DESIGN OF USEFUL RENIN INHIBITORS IS THE LACK OF DETAILED INFORMATION CONCERNING THE STRUCTURE OF THE ENZYME. PURE HUMAN RENIN IS VERY DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN AND, AS YET, NO 3-DIMENSIONAL CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS HAS BEEN PERFORMED. IT IS PROPOSED TO USE CDNA AND GENOMIC CLONES CODING FOR HUMAN RENIN TO PRODUCE THE ENZYME IN QUANTITIES SUFFICIENT FOR ESTABLISHING ITS CRYSTAL STRUCTURE. CONSTRUCTIONS ARE PROPOSED FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF BOTH PRORENIN AND MATURE RENIN IN MAMMALIAN CELLS AND FOR MATURE RENIN IN BACTERIA. IT IS PROPOSED THAT IN PHASE I, APPROPRIATE CONSTRUCTIONS WILL BE MADE AND THAT CONDITIONS WILL BE ESTABLISHED FOR OBTAINING THE DESIRED EXPRESSED PRODUCTS. PHASE II WILL ENCOMPASS THE LARGER SCALE PRODUCTION AND PURIFICATION OF THE ENZYME.

ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING SCHEMES NOW DEVISED TO HARNESS SOLAR ENERGY IS THE PHOTOELECTROLYTIC DECOMPOSITION OF WATERUSING SEMICONDUCTING ELECTRODES. ONE OF THE MAJOR PROBLEMS LIMITING INITIATION OF PRACTICAL PHOTOELECTROLYSIS IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FACT THAT ONLY SEMICONDUCTING ELECTRODESWITH WIDE BAND GAPS OF 3 EV OR GREATER MAINTAIN CHEMICAL STABILITY DURING ILLUMINATION. IN THE PROPOSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH CERAMATEC, INC. WILL ATTEMPT TO IDENTIFY CORROSION RESISTANT OXIDES WITH SMALLER BAND GAPS WHICH UTILIZE A LARGER FRACTION OF THE SOLAR SPECTRUM. SPECIFICALLY, IN THE PROPOSED PROGRAM THE TIO(2)-NBO(2) SYSTEM WHICH FORMS COMPLETE SOLID SOLUBILITY WILL BE INVESTIGATED. BY MANIPULATING THE RATIO OF NBO(2) TO TIO(2), IT IS EXPECTED THAT AN OPTIMUM SEMICONDUCTING MATERIAL CAN BE OBTAINED WHICH POSSESSES A BAND GAP BETWEEN 1.5 AND 2.5 EV, WHILE MAINTAINING AN ADEQUATE CORROSION RESISTANCE UNDER ILLUMINATION.",

A VOLUME MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUE WHICH REQUIRES LITTLE SUBJECT COOPERATION, UNLIKE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE METHODS, COULD BE USEFULLY APPLIED TO NEONATES, CHILDREN, ADULTS, AND ANIMALS. THE ACOUSTIC BODY VOLUMETER (ABV) IS AN INNOVATIVE SYSTEM WHICH WILL MEET THESE CRITERIA. IN PHASE I, THE APPLICATION OF THE ABV WILL BE EXTENDED FROM THE MEASUREMENT OF SMALL VOLUMES IN ANECHOIC SPACES TO LARGER VOLUMES IN NONANECHOIC SPACES. AT THE SAME TIME, WE WILL EXTEND OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE EFFECTS OF VARIOUS PARAMETERS, INCLUDING BACKGROUND NOISE, TEMPERATURE CHANGES, AND LOCATION AND MOVEMENT OF THE SUBJECT, ON THE ACCURACY OF THE ABV. IN PHASE II, WE WILL TEST THE ACCURACY OF THE ABV IN MEASURING HUMANS, INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF ADDITIONAL PARAMETERS SUCH AS SUBJECT MOTION, HAIR, CLOTHING, AND RESPIRATION, AND AUTOMATE THE ABV OPERATION. IN PHASE III, THE ABV WILL BE MANUFACTURED AND MARKETED. 1. CLINICS AND RESEARCH LABORATORIES STUDYING NUTRITION AND BODY DEVELOPMENT, 2.

THE INTEGRATED RESPONSE OF HEATING, VENTILATING, AND AIR CONDITIONING SUBSYSTEMS THAT IS CRUCIAL TO EFFICIENT THERMAL PERFORMANCE IS DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT WITH CONVENTIONAL SINGLE INPUT/SINGLE OUTPUT CONTROLLERS. THE APPLICATION OF ADVANCE CONTROL STRATEGIES IN SMALLER COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS, HOWEVER, IS LIMITED BY THE AVAILABILITY OF COST-EFFECTIVE HARDWARE AND SOFT- WARE. THE TRADITIONAL CONSERVATIVE APPROACH IS TO IMPLEMENT THE CONTROL LOGIC WITH RELAYS DRIVEN BY THERMOSTATS AND TIME CLOCKS. THIS APPROACH QUICKLY TENDS TO BECOME UNSATISFACTORY AS THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CONTROL STRATEGIES REQUIRES EXCESSIVE HARDWARE. ANOTHER APPROACH IS TO USE A COMPUTER SYSTEM THAT IS FULLY PROGRAMMABLE IN HIGHER LEVEL LANGUAGES TO ACHIEVE GREAT FLEXIBILITY AND INTERACTION OF CONTROL FUNCTIONS. THE SHORTCOMING OF THE FULL COMPUTER APPROACH IN SMALLER BUILDINGS IS THAT THE COST OF BOTH THE HARDWARE AND THE PROGRAMMING AND DOCUMENTATION CAN BE VERY HIGH. A POTENTIAL RESOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF IMPLEMENTING SOPHISTICATED CONTROL IN SMALL COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS IS DEVELOPING ALGORITHMS TO IMPLEMENT CONTROL LOGIC THAT IS CONCISELY DEFINED IN A TABULAR FORMAT. THE REPRE- SENTATION OF LOGIC IN A TRUTH TABLE WAS DEVELOPED IN THE FIELDS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND INFORMATION THEORY AND HAS BEEN APPLIED TO A LIMITED EXTENT FOR CONTROLS.

        "abstract": "Abstract         READING COMPREHENSION IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SKILLS IN OUR SOCIETY, YET THERE HAS BEEN A PAUCITY OF RESEARCH IN DEVELOPING CONSTRUCT VALID INSTRUMENTS TO MEASURE IT. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED STUDY IS TO DEVELOP A STATE-OF-THE-ART CONSTRUCT MEASUREMENT SYSTEM FOR READING COMPREHENSION. THE CAPABILITY TO DEVELOP SUCH A MEASUREMENT SYSTEM IS MADE POSSIBLE THROUGH THE ITEM ENGINEERING METHODOLOGY DEVELOPED BY STENNER, SMITH, AND BURDICK (1983). THE CENTRAL THEME OF THE METHODOLOGY IS SIMPLE, YET ELEGANT: UNTIL WE UNDERSTAND WHAT CHARACTERISTICS OR FEATURES OF TEST ITEMS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING ITEMS DIFFICULT OR EASY, WE DO NOT REALLY KNOW WHAT WE ARE MEASURING. ONCE THE FEATURES OF TEST ITEMS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR DIFFICULTY HAVE BEEN SPECIFIED, IT BECOMES POSSIBLE TO TRULY \"\"ENGINEER'' TEST ITEMS. EMPLOYING THIS METHODOLOGY TO THE MEASUREMENT OF READING COMPREHENSION, THE FOLLOWING TASKS WILL BE ACHIEVED: 1. DEVELOPMENT OF A MICROCOMPUTER BASED MODEL FOR ASSESSING WRITTEN DISCOURSE. 2. DEVELOPMENT OF 300 MINIPASSAGE ITEMS THAT WILL SPAN 3. DESIGN PLAN FOR CREATING A RICH CRITERION AND NORMATIVE FRAME OF REFERENCE FOR THE SCALE. SCALE SCORES FOR READING TASKS AND PEOPLE ARE REPORTED IN \"\"LEXILES'' WHICH ARE OPERATIONALLY DEFINED AS 1/900 OF THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE READING COMPREHENSION LEVEL OF PRIMERS AND GROLLIER'S THE ENCYCLOPEDIA AMERICANA. LEXILES MAY BE INTERPRETED FROM A NORMATIVE FRAME OF REFERENCE (PERSON COMPARISON) OR A CRITERION FRAME OF REFERENCE (TASK COMPARISON).",

SOLVENTS SUCH AS 2-METHYLTETRAHYDROFURAN, 2-METHYLFURAN, AND 3-METHYLSULFOLAN, ARE KNOWN TO BE STABLE TOWARD LI. HOWEVER, ALL OF THESE SOLVENTS MUST EMPLOY LIASF6 AS A SUPPORTING ELECTROLYTE TO ACHIEVE LI ELECTRODE CYCLING EFFICIENCIES IN EXCESS OF 98%. THIS SALT IS THERMALLY UNSTABLE IN PROTOTYPE BATTERIES, WHICH GREATLY LIMITS THE APPLICABILITY OF RECHARGEABLE LI TECHNOLOGY. THIS PROBLEM WILL BE ADDRESSED BY SYNTHESIZING AND PURIFYING SEVERAL NEW LI SALTS FOR EVALUATION IN SEVERAL ORGANIC SOLVENTS.

IT WILL BE DESIGNED TO OPERATE AT A POWER CONSUMPTION OF LESS THAN 1 W AND INCORPORATES EXTENSIVE POST-PROCESSING DATA COMPRESSION CAPABILITIES. THIS CMOS BASED PROCESSOR CONSISTS OF A LOWPASS FILTER FOLLOWED BY AN A/D CONVERTER AND A DISCRETE FOURIER TRANSFORM (DFT) PROCESSOR, ALL UNDER THE CONTROL OF A SOFTWARE-DRIVEN MICROPROCESSOR WHICH ALSO PERFORMS POST-PROCESSING DATA COMPRESSION OPERATIONS. THE DFT PROCESSOR PRODUCES THE SAME RESULT AS AN FFT PROCESSOR BUT DOES NOT REQUIRE THE LARGE FFT INPUT MEMORY, SINCE ALL OPERATIONS ON A DATA SAMPLE ARE PERFORMED 'ON-THE-FLY\" PRIOR TO INPUT OF THE NEXT A/D DATA SAMPLE. ALL MAJOR PROCESSING PARAMETERS INCLUDING FREQUENCY BAND PLACEMENT, RESOLUTION, AND THE LENGTH OF THE TIME AVERAGING WINDOW ARE REPROGRAMMABLE IN FLIGHT, AS ARE ALL POST-PROCESSING PARAMETERS AND ALGORITHMS. IN THE COURSE OF THIS PROJECT, AN INNOVATIVE POST-PROCESSING ALGORITHM MATCHED TO THE STATISTICS OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD DATA WILL BE DEVELOPED. POST PROCESSING CAPABILITIES WILL INCLUDE HANNING WEIGHTING IN THE FREQUENCY DOMAIN, A TWO-PASS NOISE-MEAN CALCULATION, ESTIMATION OF VARIANCE, ADAPTIVE THRESHOLDING AND THE DETERMINATION OF THE PEAK FREQUENCY, AMPLITUDE AND CLUSTER WIDTH OF SPECTRAL LINE CLUSTERS.",

THE IMPETUS TO DEVELOP ELECTROLYTIC PROCESSES OPERATING AT LOWER TEMPERATURES IS CONSIDERABLE, AND PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH GUN BARREL EROSION AND PROPULSION SYSTEM'S CORROSION HAVE REINFORCED THIS NEED.

THE INTENT OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO INVESTIGATE THE USE OF STEEL CONFINEMENT TECHNIQUES IN CONCRETE MASONRY CONSTRUCTION IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE STRENGTH AND DUCTILITYOF SHEAR WALLS AND TO MORE EFFECTIVELY USE BUILDING MATERIALS. WE PROPOSE TO ESTABLISH AND RANK SEVERAL OPTIONSWHICH WOULD PROVIDE CONFINEMENT IN CONCRETE MASONRY. THESE OPTIONS WOULD BE DEVELOPED UTILIZING OUR PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE IN STRUCTURAL DESIGN, EARTHQUAKE AND WIND ENGINEERING AND OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MASONRY CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. WE ARE ALSO PROPOSING THE DEVELOPMENT OF A TEST PROGRAM FOR QUANTIFYING IMPROVED EARTHQUAKE RESISTANCE AND DETERMINING THE COST OF TESTING EACH SELECTED DESIGN/SYSTEM/METHOD. THIS TEST PROGRAM WOULD ALSO IDENTIFY CRITERIA WHICH COULD BE USED TO EVALUATEFUTURE IMAGINATIVE METHODS OF CONFINEMENT AND THUS HELP TO ACCELERATE THE EVALUATION PROCESS CONDUCTED BY PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS AND BUILDING OFFICIALS. WE ALSO PROPOSE TO CONDUCT A PRISM TESTING OF TWO OF THE MOST PROMISING CONFINEMENT OPTIONS.",

THE PROPOSED WORK WILL STUDY THE ENGINEERING VARIABLES AND APPLICATIONS OF COULOMETRIC ELECTRODES IN SERIES FOR LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY ELECTROCHEMICAL (LCEC) DETECTOR SYSTEMS (N-ELECTRODE LCEC). SERIES COULOMETRIC ELECTRODES ASSEMBLED FROM EXISTING COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS WHERE N IS 6-8' OFFER SUB-PICOGRAM SENSITIVITY, SELECTIVITIES OF UP TO 100,000 AND THE ABILITY TO DO COMPOUND IDENTIFICATION AND VERIFICATION BY PEAK RATIOS ON DIFFERENT ELECTRODES. SIX ELECTRODE ASSEMBLIES ALLOW THE DETERMINATION OF CATECHOLAMINES AND METABOLITES IN DIRECTLY INJECTED SERUM. THE ASSEMBLIES OF EXISTING EQUIPMENT ARE, HOWEVER, NOT OPTIMIZED AND ARE UNNECESSARILY EXPENSIVE. SPECIALIZED N-ELECTRODE CELLS OF TWO TYPES WILL BE CONSTRUCTED; FOUR ELECTRODE SAMPLE CONDITIONING OR \"GATE\" CELLS AND 6-10 ELECTRODE SIGNAL ANALYSIS OR \"ARRAY\" CELLS. THE CELLS WILL BE EVALUATED FOR PERFORMANCE VARIABLES, I.E., BAND SPREADING, BACK PRESSURE, SENSITIVITY, SELECTIVITY FOR THE FOUR-CELL \"GATE\" ELECTRODE, AND RESOLUTION FOR THE 6-10 CELL ARRAY ELECTRODE. PRELIMINARY APPLICATIONS FOR DIRECT INJECTION OF BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES FOR NEUROTRANSMITTERS WILL BE RUN AND COMPARED WITH EXISTING 6- AND 8-CELL SERIES DATA, PARTICULARLY FOR SAMPLES FROM PATIENTS WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. DETECTION OF BIOCHEMICAL LEVELS OF ENKEPHELINS WILL ALSO BE TESTED. A SECOND PROPOSAL COVERING APPLICATION OF THIS TECHNIQUE SPECIFICALLY TO ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE IS ALSO BEING SUBMITTED. IT IS EXPECTED THAT SENSOR ARRAYS WILL BE PRODUCED THAT HAVE BAND SPREADING COMPATIBLE WITH MICROBORE OR FAST LC COLUMNS, SENSITIVITY OF 200 FG OR BETTER FOR NEUROTRANSMITTERS AND RESOLUTION IN THE DETECTOR THAT WILL ALLOW SEPARATION OF COELUTING PEAKS WITH 60 MV DIFFERENCES IN THEIR CURRENT-VOLTAGE CURVES. THE PHASE I EFFORTS WILL BE DEVOTED PRIMARILY TO DEVELOPING THE SPECIFICATIONS FOR LATER PHASE II DEVELOPMENT.

OTHER SYSTEM DEPENDENT DECSYSTEM-10 CAPABILITIES HAVE ALSO BEEN INCORPORATED INTO THE DIS TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY OR TO PROVIDE FEATURES WHICH COULD NOT OTHERWISE BE PROVIDED. THE DIS IS THUS JEOPARDIZED BY THE ANNOUNCED DISCONTINUANCE OF SUPPORT FOR THE DECSYSTEM-10 AS WELL AS THE 36-BIT ARCHITECTURE BY DEC. IN THIS PHASE I RESEARCH EFFORT, A DETAILED STUDY OF THE FEASIBILITY OF CONVERTING THE DIS TO OPERATE ON A 32-BIT TARGET MACHINE (DEC/VAX OR IBM MEDIUM/LARGE-SCALE SYSTEM) HAS BEEN CONDUCTED.

ABOUT 80% OF THE MOMENTUM TRANSFER OCCURS DURING THESE BURSTS. TO REDUCE VISCOUS DRAG, THE PHYSICS AND STRUCTURE OF THESE EVENTS MUST BE FULLY UNDERSTOOD. HOWEVER, PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS TO ACCOMPLISH THIS HAVE BEEN FRUSTRATED BY THE FACT THAT BURSTS OCCUR RANDOMLY IN TIME AND SPACE. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, ARTIFICIAL GENERATION OF A BURSTING EVENT WILL BE ATTEMPTED, THUS CONTROLLING THE TIME AND POSITION OF ITS OCCURRENCE. THE STRUCTURAL DETAILS OF THESE BURSTS WILL BE EDUCED VIA MEASUREMENTS PHASE-LOCKED TO THE ARTIFICIAL EXCITATION. EXPERIMENTS WILL BE CONDUCTED USING A ZERO-PRESSURE GRADIENT BOUNDARY LAYER THAT DEVELOPS ON A FLAT PLATE TOWED IN AN 18-M WATER CHANNEL. FLOW VISUALIZATION AND HOT-FILM MEASUREMENTS WILL BE CONDUCTED TO EDUCE THE TOPOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF THE ARTIFICIAL BURSTS. THE KNOWLEDGE DEVELOPED THROUGH THIS STUDY MAY PROVIDE A CONCEPTUAL APPROACH TO MODULATING THE FREQUENCY AND STRENGTH OF NATURAL BURSTS, THEREBY REDUCING DRAG.",

PRESENT TECHNIQUES ARE ONLY ABLE TO PRODUCE VERTICAL BARRIERS. THEREIS A TREMENDOUS NEED PARTICULARY IN THE CHEMICAL WASTE ISOLATION APPLICATION FOR BOTTOM BARRIERS AS WELL. THE BLOCKDISPLACEMENT TECHNIQUE HAS BEEN CONCEIVED TO FILL THIS GAP BY PLACING A BARRIER BOTH AROUND AND BENEATH A LARGE TRACT OF LAND. THE TECHNIQUE INJECTS LOW PERMABILITY MATERIAL IN A SLURRY STATE INTO NOTCHED INJECTION WELLS PROPAGATING HORIZONTALLY-ORIENTED SEPARATIONS AND LIFTING THE BLOCK OF OVERLYING GROUND IN THE PROCESS. THE RESULTS OF A FIELD TRIAL OF THE CONCEPT WERE VERY PROMISING BUT DID NOT PERMIT RIGOROUS DOCUMENTATION OF BARRIER CONTINUITY. IT IS THE OPINION OF THE SCIENTIFIC, ENGINEERING, AND CONSTRUCTION COMMUNITIES THAT FURTHER TESTING IS NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH ASCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF THIS PROCESS AND TO ASSESS ITS APPLICABILITY TO OTHER GEOLOGIC CONDITIONS. SUCH AN UNDERSTANDING IS A PREREQUISITE TO ACCEPTANCE OF BLOCK DISPLACEMENT BY THE CHEMICAL WASTE CLEANUP INDUSTRY.

THE FOLLOWING ADVANTAGES RESULT: SIMPLER AND MORE RELIABLE CONTROL SYSTEMS, FASTER CONTROL SYSTEM RESPONSE, HIGHER AVERAGE EVAPORATOR AND CONDENSER HEAT-TRANSFER COEFFICIENTS, SMALLER EVAPORATORS AND CONDENSERS, REDUCED FLUID FLOW RATES, LIGHTER TEMPERATURE CONTROL SYSTEMS, AND LESS POWER CONSUMPTION FOR TEMPERATURE CONTROL. SYSTEMS WITH CONVENTIONAL FLUIDS HAVE NO PRACTICAL MEANS FOR MEASURING QUALITY. THE SENSOR IS HEAVY AND COSTLY AND THE RESPONSE TIME IS LONG. INSTEAD, EITHER THE FLUID IS SUPER-HEATED AND POOR HEAT-TRANSFER COEFFICIENTS ARE ACCEPTED OR THE PLATE TEMPERATURE IS MEASURED AND THE CONTROL SYSTEM RESPONSE TIME IS SLOW.",

ULTIMATELY, OUR AIM IS TO INCREASE THE SENSITIVITY OF THE ASSAY SYSTEM INTO THE 15 NG/ML RANGE.

HOWEVER, IT IS FEASIBLE BY VARYING THE AMOUNT OF ANTIGEN AND ENZYME MODIFIED ANTIDIGOXIN ANTIBODY WITHIN THE IMMUNOSTRIP THAT WE CAN PRODUCE A VISUAL ASSAY WITHIN THIS LOWER RANGE. THE ASSAY HAS MANY APPLICATIONS FOR MONITORING THERAPEUTIC DRUGS, INCLUDING DIGOXIN, AND THEREFORE WILL HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE HEALTH BENEFIT/RISK RATIO WITHIN POPULATIONS OF OUR SOCIETY WHO REQUIRE DRUGS. BASED ON OUR ABILITY TO MONITOR OTHER HORMONES, DRUGS, AND SMALL HAPTENS USING THIS ASSAY, WE FEEL CONFIDENT THAT IN THE FUTURE, BY USING HIGHLY SPECIFIC POLYCLONAL ANTISERA OR MORE LIKELY MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES, IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO MONITOR ACTIVE DIGOXIN AND THEREBY PREDICT THERAPEUTIC VERSUS TOXIC LEVELS OF DIGOXIN IN A PHYSICIAN'S OFFICE WITH A ONE-MINUTE TEST.",

COLI HEAT STABLE ENTER TOXIN (ST), WHICH CAUSES 'TRAVELER'S DIARRHEA IN HUMANS, AND WIDE SPREAD OFTEN FATAL INFECTIOUS DIARRHEA (SCOURS) IN NEWBORN LIVESTOCK. OUR TWO PHASE I GOALS WILL BE 1. TO GENERATE A PANEL OF MURINE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES TO THE TOXIN, AND 2. TO COMMENCE DEVELOPMENT OF A SENSITIVE AND VERSATILE ST FLUORESCENCE IMMUNOASSAY. PURIFIED MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES WILL BE CONJUGATED TO BETA-GALACTOSIDASE AND TESTED IN A HETEROGENEOUS COMPETITIVE ASSAY FORMAT. WE INTEND TO PURSUE SOLID-PHASE METHODS FOR IMMOBILIZATION OF ST-ALBUMIN CONJUGATES, WHICH WILL THEN COMPETE WITH TEST SAMPLE FOR BINDING TO ANTIBODY-ENZYME CONJUGATES. ENZYME ACTIVITY (AND SUBSEQUENTLY, ST CONCENTRATIONS) WILL BE MEASURED IN A FLUORESCENCE ASSAY, MONITORING THE FORMATION OF METHYL-UMBELLIFERONE FROM THE NON-FLUORESCENT SUBSTRATE, METHYL-UMBELLIFERYL GALACTOSIDE. THE FINAL (FLUORESCENCE) MEASUREMENTS CAN BE MADE IN ANY APPROPRIATELY SET FLUORIMETER, OR IN A LOW-COST, PORTABLE PHOTON-COUNTING FLUORIMETER WHICH WE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING FOR USE WITH SUCH IMMUNOASSAYS. BOTH THE INSTRUMENT AND THE ASSAY FORMAT ARE GEARED TOWARDS RAPID, TECHNICALLY FACILE PERFORMANCE IN A LABORATORY ON 'FIELD' SETTING. DUE TO THE HEALTH AND ECONOMIC IMPACT OF TOXIN RELATED DISEASES, WE BELIEVE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT HUMAN AND VETERINARY COMMERCIAL MARKETS FOR SUCH A TOXIN DETECTION METHOD, AS WELL AS THE POSSIBLE COMMERCIAL UTILITY OF SUCH ANTIBODIES AS THERAPEUTIC AGENTS. OUR GROUP IS ALSO WELL POSITIONED TO ATTRACT FOLLOW-ON FUNDING FOR THIS PROJECT AND TO DEVELOP/MARKET SUCH COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS. THE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED SHOULD ALSO BE APPLICABLE TO OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND TO THE LONG TERM OBJECTIVES OF N.I.A.I.D. RESEARCH PROGRAM.",

BY THE MIDDLE OF 1977 MORE THAN 36,000PATIENTS WERE BEING REGULARLY TREATED FOR UREMIA BY HEMODIALYSIS AT AN ANNUAL COST OF $650,000,000. GENERALLY, THIS TREATMENT REQUIRED THE USE OF LARGE COMPLICATED MACHINES AT TREATMENT CENTERS. SORBENT REGENERATION OF DIALYSATE IS ONE APPROACH TO SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCING THE COST OF THIS TREATMENT. IN ADDITION, SUCH REGENERATION LENDS ITSELF BETTER TO THE PRODUCTION OF A MORE COMPACT DIALYSER. IN FACT, AN ENZYME-BASED, SORBENT SYSTEM HAS BEENDEVELOPED COMMERCIALLY (I.E., THE REDY SYSTEM). THIS SYSTEMHOWEVER STILL HAS SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS RELATED TO THE NH(4)+PRODUCED DURING THE ENZYMATIC HYDROLYSIS OF UREA. THE LONG TERM OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO DEVELOP AN ELECTROCHEMICAL UREA OXIDATION REACTOR THAT WOULD BE PART OFA SAFE, COMPACT AND INEXPENSIVE SYSTEM FOR REGENERATION OF HEMODIALYSATE. WE ENVISION TWO ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO THE UREA REACTOR AS DESCRIBED BELOW. IN EITHER CASE, HOWEVER, THE REACTOR WOULD BE PART OF A SYSTEM COMPOSED OF CHARCOAL FOR ADSORBING ALL OTHER NITROGENOUS WASTE PRODUCTS AND ION EXCHANGE RESINS FOR REDUCING THE LEVELS OF PHOSPHATEAND K(+). IN ONE VERSION OF THE REACTOR, UREA WOULD BE OXIDIZED DIRECTLY AT A CATALYTIC METAL ELECTRODE IN THE REACTOR TO PRODUCE MOSTLY NON-TOXIC OXYGEN, NITROGEN AND WATER WHICH CAN THEN BE DISPOSED OF READILY. IN THE OTHER VERSION, CHLORIDE WOULD BE OXIDIZED AT THE REACTOR ANODE TO PRODUCE HYPOCHLORITE WHICH WOULD THEN COMPLETELY OXIDIZE THEUREA. ANY UNREACTED HYPOCHLORITE ION WOULD BE REMOVED BY REDUCTION AT THE REACTOR CATHODE OR, IF NECESSARY, BY ADSORPTION ON A CHARCOAL BED. PHASE 1 OF THE PROGRAM WOULD BE DEVOTED LARGELY TO SELECTING THE REACTOR CONFIGURATION THAT EXHIBITED THE BEST OVERALL PERFORMANCE. IN PHASE 2, EXTENSIVE TOXICOLOGY TESTS OF TREATED DIALYSATE WOULD BE PERFORMED. REACTOR DESIGN WOULD BE OPTIMIZED AND SCALE-UP OF THE REACTOR TO THE PROPER CAPACITY WOULD BE CARRIED OUT. THIS WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY THE CONSTRUCTION OF A FULL-SIZE PROTOTYPE REGENERATION SYSTEM. THIS SYSTEM WOULD FIRST BE TESTED AT THE LABORATORY BENCH, THEN WITH ANIMALS AND FINALLY IT WOULD UNDERGO CLINICAL TRIALS WITH HUMANS AT A KIDNEY TREATMENT CENTER.",

THE MODELING WILL BE IN LUMPED PARAMETER FORM SUITABLE FOR POWER SYSTEM ANALYSIS AND WILL INCLUDE THE POWER CONDITIONING SUB-SYSTEM BY WHICH THE DC OUTPUT OF THE MHD GENERATOR IS CONNECTED TO THE UTILITY GRID. A TYPICAL OPERATIONAL SITUATION WILL BE CONSIDERED AND THE BEHAVIOR OF AN MHD/STEAM COMBINED CYCLE PLANT WILL BE COMPARED WITH ITS CONVENTIONAL COUNTERPART.

THEY ARE GROUPED ACCORDING TO THEIR DENSITY AS DETERMINED BY ULTRACENTRIFUGATION. PLASMA LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEINS (LDL) CONTAIN APPROXIMATELY 75% LIPID AND 25% PROTEIN AND FUNCTION AS A MAJOR CARRIER OF CHOLESTEROL. APOLIPOPROTEIN B IS THE STRUCTURAL PROTEIN MOIETY OF LDL (1). THE MEASUREMENT OF ELEVATED LEVELS OF APOLIPOPROTEIN B HAS BEEN REPORTED TO BE A MARKER OF CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (2). IN ADDITION THE MEASUREMENT OF REDUCED LEVELS OF HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (HDL) CHOLESTEROL (3) AND APOLIPOPROTEIN A-1 HAVE ALSO BEEN REPORTED TO BE A MARKER. HDL CONTAINS APPROXIMATELY 50% APOLIPOPROTEIN WITH 32% OF THE LIPID COMPONENT BEING CHOLESTEROL AND 65% OF THE APOLIPOPROTEIN BEING A-1(5). WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES WITH SPECIFICITY FOR APOLIPOPROTEIN B FROM HUMAN PLASMA LDL (6). BECAUSE OF THE ROLE THAT LIPOPROTEINS PLAY IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF ATHEROSCLEROSIS THEIR QUANTITATION IS IMPORTANT NOT ONLY FOR METABOLIC STUDIES BUT FOR THE CHARACTERIZATION OF DYSLIPOPROTEINEMIAS.

THE RESIST PATTERN WITHSTANDS OXYGEN PLASMA OR RIE ETECH CONDITIONS. THE ACHIEVMENT OF A SUITABLE ALL-DRY SYSTEM WILL ELIMINATE MANY SHORTCOMINGS OF SPIN-DEPOSITED RESISTS LEADING TO A SIMPLER SAFER, AND LESS WASTE-G GENERATING PROCESS FOR IC MANUFACTURE. THE PROGRAM OBJECTIVES ARE: 1. TO IDENTIFY SUBSITUTED STRUCTURES OF HIGH SENSITIVITY AND DETERMINE THEIR LITHOGRAPHIC PROPETIES.THE COMPOUNDS WILL BE PREPARED FOR HYDROLOSIS OF ORGANOTRIHALOSILANES (OR CO-HYDROLYSIS OF MIXTURES OF ORGANOTRIHALOSILANES), SUBSEQUENT DEHYDRATION, AND ISOLATIONOF THE SILSESQUIOXANE POLYMER BY SUBLIMATION OR CRYSTALLIZATION. 2.

IONS MADE IN THE SOURCE REGION OF A QUADRUPOLE MASS SPECTROMETER ARE EXTRACTED AND FOCUSED INTO A BEAM. THE ION BEAM IS THEN INJECTED AXIALLY INTO A SUPERCONDUCTING ELECTROMAGNET WHERE THE IONS ARE DETECTED BY A FOURIER TRANSFORM MASS SPECTROMETER. QFT-MS COMBINES THE POWERFUL SAMPLE IONIZATION FEATURES OF A QUADRUPOLE MASS SPECTROMETER WITH THE VERSATILITY AND HIGH MASS RESOLUTION AVAILABLE WITH FOURIER TRANSFORM DETECTION. THE MAIN GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP AN ION STORAGE DEVICE THAT WILL INCREASE THE SENSITIVITY OF QFT-MS. THE DEVICE UTILIZES A STRONG MAGNETIC FIELD AND A SEQUENCE OF PULSES TO INTEGRATE WEAK ION CURRENTS UNTIL A SUFFICIENT NUMBER ARE PRESENT TO ACQUIRE A GOOD QUALITY MASS SPECTRUM. IT HAS THE POTENTIAL OF INCREASING THE SENSITIVITY OF QFT-MS OVER ONE HUNDREDFOLD SO THAT PICOMOLE (10-12) LEVELS OF OLIGOPEPTIDES, NUCLEOTIDES, AND CERTAIN DRUGS COULD BE DETECTED AND THEIR STRUCTURES ELUCIDATED. IF THE ION STORAGE DEVICE CAN BE PERFECTED, QFT-MS WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BECOME THE METHOD OF CHOICE FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF HIGH PERFORMANCE MASS SPECTROMETERS. IONSPEC HAS HAD SEVERAL INQUIRIES FROM PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES INTERESTED IN USING QFT-MS TO SEQUENCE BIOPOLYMERS AND TO ELUCIDATE THE STRUCTURES OF DRUGS COVALENTLY BOUND TO DNA BASES. AGRICULTURAL CHEMICAL COMPANIES ARE INTERESTED IN USING QFT-MS TO IDENTIFY AND QUANTIFY PESTICIDE AND HERBICIDE RESIDUES IN CROPS AND ANIMAL TISSUES.

THE RUBY PRESSURE SENSOR HAS LONG BEEN USED FOR STATIC HIGH PRESSURE MEASUREMENT. IN THIS WORK, WE SEEK TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF DYNAMIC HIGH PRESSURE MEASUREMENTS IN RUBY USING THE PRESSURE DEPENDENT SPECTRAL SHIFT OF THE R LINE FLUORESCENCE EVEN THOUGH RUBY MAY NOT BE THE BEST MATERIAL TO USE. THE SENSOR IS INTENDED TO MEASURE DYNAMIC PRESSURE TO 10 KBAR WITH A 1 MHZ BANDWIDTH. THE MAJOR PROBLEM IS TO FIND A WAY TO ACCOUNT FOR TEMPERATURE CHANGES IN THE SENSOR WHICH ALSO AFFECT THE FLUORESCENCE SPECTRUM.

THE CHANNEL CATFISH, ICTALURUS PUNCTATUS, IS ONE OF 12 SPECIES DESIGNATED BY THE NATIONAL AQUACULTURE DEVELOPMENT PLAN AS HAVING HIGH PRIORITY FOR COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT. ALTHOUGH LOW DENSITY POND PRODUCTION SYSTEMS ARE IN USE THROUGHOUT THE U.S., DATA IS REQUIRED THAT WOULD PERMIT THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTENSIVE, HIGH-DENSITY CULTURE SYSTEMS, USEFUL IN REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF LAND AND WATER RESOURCES NECCESSARY FOR COMMERCIAL CATFISH FARMING. ASI IS EVALUATING THE FEASIBILITY OF COMMERCIAL, VERY HIGH-DENSITY CHANNEL CATFISH CULTURE, USING GEOTHERMAL WATER AND LIQUID OXYGEN. CRITICAL DATA ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS OF CHANNEL CATFISH IN INTENSIVE CULTURE SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN OBTAINED, INDICATING THE NEED TO EVALUATE THE COMBINED, INTERACTIVE EFFECTS OF SEVERAL METABOLIC WASTES AND CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS PRESENT AS A RESULT OF THE VERY HIGH DENSITIES UTILIZED. SEVERAL NOVEL CULTURE TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING THE USE OF HIGH-DENSITY CIRCULAR TANKS AND LIQUID OXYGEN INJECTION, WILL BE EVALUATED FOR INCORPORATION INTO THE PRODUCTION PROCESS. ALSO, AN OVERALL RETURN-ON-INVESTMENT ANALYSIS WILL BE CONDUCTED EVALUATE THE COMMERCIAL FEASIBILITY OF INTENSIVE CHANNEL CATFISH FARMING.",

THIS STUDY SEEKS TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS BY INVESTIGATING THE FEASIBILITY OF INHIBITING MOLT PROCESSES AND BY IMPROVING MOLTING CONTROL AND SUBSEQUENT SURVIVAL THROUGH TEMPERATURE AND DIET MANIPULATION. COLDWATER EXPERIMENTS WILL ATTEMPT TO DETERMINE OPTIMAL TEMPERATURES AND TIMES FOR MOLT INHIBITION IN VARIOUS GEOGRAPHICAL LOBSTER STOCKS. OTHER EXPERIMENTS WILL RESEARCH THE USEFULNESS OF WARMWATER TO STIMULATE MOLTING AND WEIGHT GAININ CANNER SIZED LOBSTER, AND THE FEASIBILITY OF FORMULATING AN INEXPENSIVE ARTIFICIAL DIET FOR USE IN LOBSTER POUND SYSTEMS. IT ISANTICIPATED THAT THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY WILL SUPPLY TECHNIQUES THAT WILL MAKE LOBSTER HOLDING FACILITIES A PRACTICAL SOLUTION FOR PROVIDING YEAR-ROUND SUPPLY OF LIVE LOBSTERS.

THIS PROJECT ADDRESSES THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ADVANCED, COMPACT MULTIGAS LASER FOR AIRBORNE AND SHUTTLE-BASED LIDAR SYSTEMS. NEWLY DEVELOPED EXCIMER LASER AND PULSE POWER TECHNOLOGY PERMITS THE DESIGN OF A LASER WITH EXTENDED TUNABILITY IN THE IR AND UV PARTS OF THE SPECTRUM AND WITH GREATLY INCREASED EFFICIENCY. THE LASER WILL BE LINE-TUNABLE OVER MORE THAN 200 SPECTRAL LINES IN THE NEAR AND FAR IR, CONTINUOUSLY TUNABLE OVER THE 9 AND 10 BANDS OF CO2, AND WILL HAVE SOME TUNABILITY AROUND SELECTED EXCIMER BANDS IN THE UV. NARROWBAND PULSE ENERGIES WILL BE BETWEEN 100 MJ AND 1 J AT PULSE FREQUENCIES UP TO 50 HZ. THIS PERFORMANCE IS CONSIDERABLY BETTER THAN THAT OF PRESENT LIDAR SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION TO THE IMPROVED TUNABILITY AND OPTICAL POWER LEVEL, THE LASER WILL BE DESIGNED FOR EXTENDED LIFE AND RELIABILITY.

THREE TYPES OF LIPOSOMAL CARRIERS WITH DIFFERENT RELEASE CHARACTERISTICS WERE TESTED. PEAK PLASMA CONCENTRATIONS OF COMPARABLE DOSES OF (I), IN LIPOSOMES OR AS SOLUTION, WERE REDUCED 2.575 TIMES WHEN GIVEN ENCAPSULATED. PROLONGED PLASMA LEVELS OVER AT LEAST 4 HOURS WERE ACHIEVED WITH ENCAPSULATED (I), WHEREAS A COMPARABLE DOSE OF (I) IN SOLUTION WAS ELIMINATED FROM PLASMA WITHIN 2 HOURS.

IN PHASE I WE WOULD ASSEMBLE A PROTOTYPE SYSTEM, PROGRAM THE OPERATING SOFTWARE, AND PREPARE A SIMPLE DEMONSTRATION PROCEDURE TO TEST THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE SYSTEM BY CHILDREN. IN PHASE II WE WOULD DEVELOP A SERIES OF TEST PROGRAMS FOR DIAGNOSING DYSLEXIA AND PROVIDING REMEDIATION. THE PERFORMANCE OF THE TEST PROGRAMS WOULD BE EVALUATED IN PHASE II BY DIRECT COMPARISON WITH THE METHODS PRESENTLY USED AT THE CORTICAL FUNCTION LABORATORY, MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL, AND THE CARROLL SCHOOL FOR DYSLEXIO CHILDREN IN LINCOLN MA. IF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR COMPUTER TECHNIQUES COULD BE DEMONSTRATED, WE WOULD PROCEED TO DEVELOP AN ENTERPRISE TO DELIVER THESE SERVICES ON A LARGE SCALE.",

THIS DEVICE CAN BE APPLIED TO CELLS IN CULTURE WHICH ARE ATTACHED TO A SOLID SUPPORT AND MAINTAINED UNDER FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR GROWTH. THIS ENVIRONMENT WILL BE SUSTAINED WITHIN A NOVEL INCUBATION CHAMBER WHICH PROVIDES FLOWING NUTRIENT MEDIA AND ALLOWS IN SITU ANALYSIS AND SORTING. THE INSTRUMENT UTILIZES A LASER-ILLUMINATED FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPE SYSTEM, EQUIPPED WITH COMPUTER CONTROLLED BEAM ATTENUATION AND TWO-DIMENSIONAL STAGE MOVEMENT. A DEDICATED MICROCOMPUTER DIRECTS THE SORTING OPERATIONS AND PROVIDES GRAPHIC/TABULAR OUTPUT OF THE ACQUIRED DATA. THE BASIS OF CELL SELECTION IS PROVIDED BY FLUORESCENT LABELLING OF SPECIFIC CELLULAR COMPONENTS. SUBSEQUENT TO LABELLING, THE INSTRUMENT WILL EXAMINE THE ENTIRE AREA OF THE GROWTH PLATE AND SELECT CELLS BASED UPON DIFFERENTIAL RESPONSES. SORTING THEN PROCEEDS BY EITHER ISOLATING THE DESIRED CELLS AND THEIR UNDERLYING SUPPORT BY A LASER INSCRIBING ACTION ALLOWING PHYSICAL SEPARATION, OR BY SPARING THE DESIRED CELLS FROM A HIGH-INTENSITY LASER BEAM WHICH DESTROYS ALL OTHER CELLS. SINCE MOST NORMAL CELL LINES EXHIBIT ANCHORAGE-DEPENDENT MECHANISMS TO MAINTAIN CELL FUNCTION AND DIFFERENTIATION, THIS DEVELOPMENT ADVANCES THE ART OF CELL SORTING TO INCLUDE ALL TYPES OF CULTURED CELLS.",

SI BIPOLAR TRANSISTORS AND GUNN DIODES ARE HOWEVER NOT SUITABLE FOR MONOLITHIC INTEGRATION OF MICROWAVE CIRCUITS ON GAAS. THE HIGHER FM NOISE OF GAAS MESFET OSCILLATORS HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO THE HIGHER 1/F NOISE OF THE GAAS MESFET DEVICE.

DNA HYBRIDIZATION PROBES ARE USEFUL FOR DETECTING SPECIFIC PATHOGENS AND GENETIC ALTERATIONS. RADIOAUTOGRAPHY, CURRENTLY THE MOST SENSITIVE DETECTION TECHNIQUE, CAN VISUALIZE 15 PICOGRAMS OF TARGET DNA IN AN OVERNIGHT EXPOSURE. IN ORDER TO FULLY UTILIZE THE POTENTIAL OF DNA PROBES IN A CLINICAL SETTING, A SIMPLE, RAPID, SENSITIVE, NONRADIOACTIVE DETECTION METHOD IS NEEDED. FLUORESCENCE DETECTION, WITH ITS HIGH INHERENT SENSITIVITY, SHOULD PROVIDE SUCH A SYSTEM. IN PHASE I WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE A FLUORESCENT HYBRID DETECTION SYSTEM UTILIZING FLUORESCENT OLIGONUCLEOTIDE HYBRIDIZATION PROBES IN A FOCUSED HYBRIDIZATION FORMAT, IN COMBINATION WITH A HIGHLY SENSITIVE MICROFLUORIMETER. PRELIMINARY RESULTS SUGGEST THAT INSTANTANEOUS DETECTION LIMITS FOR SUCH A SYSTEM ARE AT A LEVEL PROMISING SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE AND UTILITY.

TO THE EXTENT THAT PLASMA OBTAINED USING MEMBRANES LACKS THE HIGH MOLECULAR WEIGHT PROTEINS FOUND IN CENTRIFUGED PLASMA, IT SHOULD BE PARTICULARLY SUITABLE FOR ENZYMATIC ANALYSIS OF IMPORTANT LOW MOLECULAR WEIGHT SOLUTES. THE THIN FILM COLORIMETRY TO BE INVESTIGATED WILL NOT RELY ON SEMIQUANTATIVE REFLECTANCE MEASUREMENTS, SUCH AS THOSE USED IN PRESENT HOME GLUCOSE INDICATORS, BUT ON ENZYMATIC SCHEMES IN COMBINATION WITH TRANSMISSION SPECTROMETERS. THE UNDERLYING GOAL OF THE ENTIRE PROGRAM WILL BE TO PROVIDE ACCEPTABLE CLINICAL BLOOD ANALYSES WITH A MUCH REDUCED INVESTMENT OF CLINICAL LABOR.

ALTHOUGH CHEMICALLY SIMILAR TO TC-99M, APPLICATION OF RE-186 TO YIELD POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS PRESENTS PROBLEMS WHICH HAVE YET TO BE SOLVED. SPECIFICALLY, IT IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN RE IN REDUCED OXIDATION STATES THAN TC, AND THUS RE-LABELED AGENTS HAVE A GREATER TENDENCY TO REVERT TO PERRHENATE. ALSO, LIGAND EXCHANGE REACTIONS ON RE PROCEED MORE SLOWLY THAN DO ANALOGOUS REACTIONS ON TC, AND CONDITIONS USED FOR THE LIGAND EXCHANGE SYNTHESIS OF RE-186 ANTIBODY CONJUGATES WILL HAVE TO BE DEVELOPED TO ALLOW EXCHANGE WHILE PREVENTING LOSS OF REACTIVITY. IN THIS PROJECT WE WILL DEVELOP SEVERAL PROCEDURES NEEDED FOR THE LABELING OF PROTEIN CONJUGATES WITH RE-186. THESE WILL INVOLVE REDUCTION OF PERRHENATE USING AGENTS SUCH AS SN(II), AS WELL AS LIGAND EXCHANGE PROCEDURES USING RE-186 COMPLEXES SUCH AS AND RE-CITRATE. INITIAL EXPERIMENTS WILL BE CONDUCTED WITH THE FREE BIFUNCTIONAL LIGAND, AND SUBSEQUENT EXPERIMENTS WILL UTILIZE THE ANTIBODY CONJUGATES WHICH ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE. LABELING YIELDS WILL BE MONITORED BY HPLC TECHNIQUES. IN VITRO IMMUNOREACTIVITY ASSESSMENT WILL BE DONE TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF RADIOLABELING AND CONJUGATION ON ANTIBODIES. THE ABILITY TO LABEL ANTIBODIES WITH RE-186 IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS DEVELOPING A RE-186 RADIOIMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC AGENT.",

TO ACHIEVE THIS, RESEARCH IS PLANNED TO SYNTHESIZE AND CHARACTERIZE POROUS MAGNETITE BEADS; TO DETERMINE THE EFFICIENCY OF CO60 AND THE OVERALL RADIO- ACTIVITY REMOVAL BY MAGNETITE; AND TO SUDY THE EFFECT OF OTHER IONS ON CO60 ADSORPTION CAPACITY, THE THRESHOLD TEMPERATURE AT WHICH MAGNETITE BECOMES EFFECTIVE, AND THE RELEASE OF CO60 AND OTHER SPECIES AT THE SHUTDOWN TEMPERATURES, OPTIMAL BED DEPTHS, ETC.",

THE PROPOSED SYSTEM WILL REPLACE THE CURRENTLY USED PNUEMATIC SYSTEM WHICH WEIGHS APPROXIMATELY 375 POUNDS. THE NEW FULLY DEVELOPED SYSTEM, WHICH WILL BE HYDRAULIC AND POWERED BY BATTERIES, WILL OCCUPY APPROXIMATELY 75 CUBIC INCHES (IN TWO PIECES) AND WEIGH LESS THAN FIVE POUNDS. THE MUCH DISCUSSED \"QUALITY OF LIFE\" OF THE ARTIFICIAL HEART RECIPIENT WILL BE GREATLY IMPROVED BY SUCH A DEVICE. THE PHASE I EFFORT WILL PROVE (IN VITRO) THE FEASIBILITY OF DRIVING THE IMPLANTED JARVIK-7 WITH AN EXTERNAL HYDRAULIC PUMP, AND WILL MAKE THE FIRST REDUCTION IN SIZE OF THE ELECTRONIC CONTROLLER UNIT. THE PHASE II EFFORT WILL COMPLETE THE MINIATURIZATION OF THE ELECTRONIC CONTROLLER AND WILL DEMONSTRATE THE EXTERNAL DRIVE SYSTEM'S CAPABILITIES THROUGH IN VIVO ANIMAL TESTING. THE OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT ESTIMATED THAT 84,000 PERSONS PER YEAR ARE CANDIDATES FOR ARTIFICIAL HEARTS.

THE DESIGN GOAL IS FOR A COMPLETE MODULE TO HANDLE STREAMS OF DATA OF OF ABOUT 5 MEGABYTE/S AVERAGE INPUT RATE AND 50 MEGABYTE/S PEAK INPUT RATE (I.E., 10% INPUT DUTY CYCLE FOR MINIMAL DEAD TIME), WHILE PROVIDING A MINIMUM PROCESSING CAPACITY OF 5 INSTRUCTION/BYTES OF INPUT DATA OR 25 MILLION INSTRUCTION/S (MIPS). THEE SYSTEM SHOULD ALSO PROVIDE FOR MODULAR EXPANSION OF THE PROCESSING CAPACITY TO 100 MIPS. THE HARDWARE UTILIZES A VERY LARGE SCALE INTEGRATION (VLSI) FASTBUS INTERFACE DEVELOPED UNDER A PREVIOUS SBIR CONTRACT. PROCESSING POWER IS PROVIDED IN ONE OF THREE MANNERS (TO BE INVESTIGATED): (1) AN ARRAY OF COMMERCIAL VLSI PARALLEL-PROCESSING ARRAY ELEMENTS FEATURING INTEGRATEDON-CHIP RAM AND SERIAL I/O CHANNELS; (2) AN ARRAY OF LATEST GENERATION 16- OR 32-BIT MICROPROCESSORS WITH MINIMAL RAM, ROM, AND I/O CAPACITY/CHIP; OR (3) A SINGLE, HIGH- PERFORMANCE SPECIALIZED PIPELINED PROCESSOR CONSTRUCTED FROM ECL (EMMITER COUPLED LOGIC) BIT SLICES.

A DIRECT TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT OF THE SAMPLE WILL BE INCLUDED WITH THE INSTRUMENT SO THAT THE TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF THE DIELECTRIC CONSTANTS COULD BE PROPERLY ACCOUNTED FOR. THE SENSOR WOULD BE SMALL, RUGGED, RELIABLE, RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE, AND LOW IN POWER REQUIREMENTS.

IN PHASE I OF THE PROPOSED PROGRAM, WE WILL DEVELOP OPTICAL MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES TO QUANTITATE CERTAIN UNIVERSAL CELLULAR RESPONSES TO CHEMICAL INJURY. ANALYSIS WILL BE PERFORMED ON CELL MONOLAYERS IN THE TISSUE CULTURE DISH UTILIZING LASER OR XENON ILLUMINATION AND SENSITIVE PHOTOMETRIC SYSTEMS. LETHAL AND SUBLETHAL EFFECTS OF CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES WILL BE ASSESSED BY LIGHT SCATTERING AND FLUORESCENT DYE MEASUREMENTS. IN THIS MANNER, ALL CURRENT LABORATORY CYTOTOXIC PARAMETERS CAN BE OBTAINED: CELL VIABILITY, MORPHOLOGIC CHANGE, CELL GROWTH AND REPRODUCTION. A MEASURE OF THE BASAL METABOLIC ACTIVITY OF THE CELLS IS ALSO PROPOSED AS PART OF THIS SYSTEM. FURTHERMORE, WITH ADDITIONAL OPTIONAL FLUORESCENT TECHNIQUES (SUCH AS ENZYMATIC, IMMUNOLOGIC, OR HISTOCHEMICAL), THE POTENTIAL EXISTS FOR QUANTITATING SPECIALIZED CELL FUNCTION. A RAPID QUANTITATIVE ASSAY FOR PHAGOCYTIC ACTIVITY IS POSSIBLE UTILIZING FLUORESCENT PARTICLES ALSO.

RECIPROCATING EXPANDERS ARE USED AT PRESENT FOR THIS APPLICATION BECAUSE THE CAPACITY OF EACH SATELLITE REFRIGERATORS IS RELATIVELY SMALL, AND \"WET\" EXPANSION TURBINES TO EXPAND SUCH SMALL FLOW RATES ARE NOT AVAILABLE. TO INCREASE THE RELIABILITY OF THE SYSTEMS AND TO REDUCE THE NEED FOR MAINTENANCE, IT IS DESIRABLE TO REPLACE THE RECIPROCATING EXPANDERS WITH MINIATURE TURBOEXPANDERS. THIS PROJECT INTENDS TO DEVELOP AND TEST A \"WET\" CRYOGENIC TURBOEXPANDER OPERATING IN GAS BEARINGS. THE PRINCIPAL FEATURES OF THE DESIGN ARE SUPERIOR RELIABILITY, EASE OF MAINTENANCE, AND HIGH EFFICIENCY. THIS PROGRAM WILL ESTABLISH SPECIFICATIONS FOR WET TURBOEXPANDERS AND PERFORM PRELIMINARY FLUID AND MECHANICAL DESIGN TO DETERMINE THE TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY OF EMPLOYING A GAS-BEARING TURBOEXPANDER AS A \"WET\" EXPANDER.",

ANOTHER IMPROVEMENTIS THAT BECAUSE OF THE PULSING AIR, THE AIR HEADER SUPPLY C CAN BE LOCATED BELOW THE MEDIA TO PERMIT FULL USE OF THEM MEDIA CAPACITY FOR BIOLOGICAL OXIDATION AND FILTRATION. THISAUTOMATED HIGH RATE SYSTEM PROVIDES SECONDARY TREATMENT AT LOADING AT LEAST FIVE TIMES OF ACTIVATED SLUDGE AND NO CLARIFIERS ARE NECESSARY. AN 8-10 GPM AUTOMATED PILOT PLANTCONTAINS TWO CELLS. ONE CELL WILL CONTAIN A VOCANIC ASH M MEDIA AND THE OTHER ACTIVATED CARBON. THE MEDIA EFFECTIVE SISIZE IS ABOUT 3.5 MM. ACTIVATED CARBON WILL BE INVESTIGATED BECAUSE OF ITS POTENTIAL FOR USE IN THE BIOLOGICAL DEGRAD ATION OF INDUSTRIAL OR HAZARDOUS WASTES. THE TREATMENT PE PERFORMANCE AND OXYGEN UTILIZATION EFFICIENCY WILL BE CO COMPARED FOR THE TWO MEDIA. THE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE AND OXYGEN TRANSFER EFFICIENCY WILL BE EVALUATED BY TREATING PRIMARY EFFLUENT WASTEWATER AT A MUNICIPAL FACILITY. THE AIRSPARGE RATE AND PULSING TIME INTERVAL WILL BE VARIED AND THELEVEL OF IMPROVEMENT IN OXYGEN TRANSFER EFFICIENCY AND E EFFECT ON TREATMENT PERFORMANCE WILL BE OBSERVED.

THE PROBLEM OF EFFECTIVE PREDICTION OF RF AND PRI AGILE RADAR SIGNALS IS CURRENTLY UNSOLVED. THE TECHNICAL APPROACH IS TO UTILIZE SPECTRAL MEASUREMENT OF THE INTENTIONAL MODULATION ON PULSE (IMOP) AND THE UNINTENTIONAL MODULATION ON PULSE (UMOP) FOR EMITTER CORRELATION SORTING AND STATISTICAL LEAST SQUARE PREDICTIONS, AS APPLIED BY KALMAN FILTERING, FOR JAMMER RF AND TIME POWER MANAGEMENT. SPECTRAL MEASUREMENTS AND CORRELATION SORTING WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED WITH SURFACE ACOUSTIC WAVE ANALOG DEVICES. STATISTICAL ESTIMATE PROCESSING WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED DIGITALLY THROUGH A PARALLEL, MULTIPROCESSING NETWORK, FEATURING HIGH SPEED INDEPENDENT AND PARALLEL MEMORY ACCESS.

THE BASIC APPROACH IS TO STUDY THE HARDWARE/SOFTWARE TRADEOFFS OF CONVENTIONAL (VON NEUMANN) AND NON-VON (PARALLEL, PIPELINE, VECTOR, ARRAY, AND CUSTOM PROCESSORS) WITH NONCONVENTIONAL ARITHMETIC (SBNR) IN AN ATTEMPT TO IDENTIFY OPTIMAL ALGORITHMS (OF ORDER AREA X TIME) WHICH ARE COMPUTATIONALLY FAST YET FLEXIBLE. A TWO STEP PROCESS IS ASSUMED; FIRST THE SEQUENTIAL ALGORITHMS ARE TO BE SPEEDED-UP (SEEKING INHERENT PARALLELISM) AND SECOND, FAST ALGORITHMS ARE TO BE MAPPED ONTO NEW VLSI ARCHITECTURES (VIA RECURSION AND PIPELINING). THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO PROVIDE THEORETICAL DESIGN TOOLS AND INTERCONNECTION STRATEGIES CAPABLE OF ACHIEVING REAL-TIME IMPLEMENTATION OF SIGNAL PROCESSING ALGORITHMS VIA LIMITED USER-PROGRAMMABLE MECHANISMS (E.G., FIRMWARE). FLEXIBLE FIRMWARE-ORIENTED ARCHITEC TURES DEDICATED TO SIGNAL PROCESSING CAN THEN BE IDENTIFIED. A SYSTOLIC ARRAY FOR PERFORMING RECURSIVE LEAST-SQUARES MINIMIZATION IS PROPOSED. IT PERFORMS AN ORTHOGONAL TRIANGULARIZATION OF THE DATA MATRIX USING A PIPELINED SEQUENCE OF GIVENS ROTATIONS AND GENERATES THE REQUIRED RESIDUAL WITHOUT HAVING TO SOLVE THE ASSOCIATED TRIANGULAR LINEAR SYSTEM BY BACK-SUBSTITUTION.",

THE SUCCESS OF A RESOURCE LIMITED DEFENSE AGAINST THIS OFFENSE TACTIC RESTS HEAVILY ON ITS CAPABILITY TO PERFORM THE DECOY/RV DISCRIMINATION FUNCTION WITH HIGH PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, THE OFFENSE IN ASSESSING ITS EFFECTIVENESS REQUIRES A GOOD QUANTITATIVE MEASURE OF THE DEFENSE'S DISCRIMINATION CAPABILITY. THE OFFENSE IS ALSO INTERESTED IN ANY MEANS BY WHICH THIS DISCRIMINATION CAPABILITY CAN BE EFFECTIVELY REDUCED. THE USE OF A JAMMER ECM THREAT AGAINST THE RADAR IN CONJUNCTION WITH DECOYS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE MORE COST EFFECTIVE THAN DECOPYS BY THEMSELVES. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE JAMMER TACTIC IS RELATED TO THE LEVEL OF DISCRIMINATION DEGRADATION PRODUCED BY THE JAMMER INDUCED RADAR NOISE. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A METHODOLOGY FOR CREATING AND EVALUATING THE EFFECT OF A CLOUD OF JAMMERS ON A DEFENSIVE RADAR'S ABILITY TO DISCRIMINATE DECOYS FROM REENTRY VEHICLES. THE METHOD INCLUDES A MEANS OF DETERMINING, THROUGH SIMULATION, EQUIVALENT DISCRIMINATION K-FACTOR (K = DELTA MICRON/SIGMA) AS A FUNCTION OF RADAR SIGNAL TO NOISE RATIO. THE DISCRIMINATION DATA ALSO PERMITS A PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF THE USE OF ALTERNATE MEANS FOR THRESHOLD SELECTION IN THE JAMMER SCENARIO.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         SPIRE HAS DEVELOPED A SURFACE LAYER ACTIVATION (SLA) TECHNIQUE FOR MEASURING MATERIAL LOSS DUE TO WEAR, EROSION OR CORROSION TO AN ACCURACY OF .1 MICROMETERS. BECAUSE THE TECHNIQUE IS NONDESTRUCTIVE AND IS EASILY APPLIED IN SITU AND ON-LINE, IT HAS ENJOYED NOTABLE SUCCESS, PARTICULARLY IN SITUATIONS WHERE CONVENTIONAL WEAR MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES ARE COSTLY OR IMPRACTICAL. THE REMARKABLE ACCURACY OF SLA IS PARTLY LIMITED BY THE FACT THAT THE TECHNIQUE REQUIRES THE USE OF CONVENTIONAL LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS TO DETERMINE A CALIBRATION PROFILE OF THE ACCELERATOR INDUCED ACTIVATION WHICH IS TYPICALLY DISTRIBUTED OVER SEVERAL MICROMETERS. SPIRE PROPOSES TESTING METHODS OF ACTIVATION, WHICH WILL RESTRICT THE ACTIVATION TO AN EXTREMELY SHALLOW, UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION ALLOWING AN IMPROVED ACCURACY OF WEAR MEASUREMENTS. THE ALTERNATIVE METHODS TO BE TESTED INCLUDE DIFFUSION OF TRACER RADIONUCLIDES INTO THE SURFACE, DIFFUSION OR ION IMPLANTATION FOLLOWED BY NEUTRON ACTIVATION OF SURFACE LAYER ELEMENTS, AND USING PARTICLE BEAMS AT OBLIQUE ANGLES. IN ADDITION TO APPLICATIONS OF WEAR MEASUREMENT IN WHICH EXTREME ACCURACY IS REQUIRED, SUCH AS MAGNETIC RECORDING DEVICES, PRECISION GRYOSCOPES, ETC., NANOMETER ACCURACY WOULD ALLOW PRECISE TIMING OF WEAR. FOR EXAMPLE, IF IT IS KNOWN THAT WEAR OCCURS ONLY DURING SOME BRIEF ENGINE TRANSITION PERIOD, THIS WOULD ALLOW THE DETERMINATION OF EXACTLY WHEN DURING OPERATION THE PROBLEM OCCURS. THE METHOD COULD THEREFORE SERVE AS A REAL-TIME DIAGNOSTIC TOOL FOR ENGINEERING AS WELL AS MATERIALS SCIENCE APPLICATIONS.",

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT INSOLUBLE ANTINEOPLASTIC COMPOUNDS CAN BE PREPARED IN THE FORM OF STABLE SUSPENSIONS OF PARTICLES OF (A) ONE MICRON DIAMETER, FOR INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION AND DEPOSITION IN THE RETICULOENDOTHELIAL SYSTEM WITH SUBSEQUENT SLOW SOLUBILIZATION AND RELEASE TO MALIGNANT TISSUES (PRIMARILY LIVER METASTASES AND SPLENIC LYMPHOMAS); AND (B) 150-300 MICRON DIAMETER, FOR INTRARTERIAL DELIVERY VIA SELECTIVE CATHETERIZATION OF A TUMOR-FEEDING ARTERY. THESE PARTICLES WOULD PARTIALLY EMBOLIZE THE VESSEL ALLOWING SUBSEQUENT SLOW SOLUBILIZATION AND SELECTIVE DELIVERY OF THE CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENT DIRECTLY TO THE MALIGNANT TISSUE. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS AN EXTENSION OF STUDIES WITH RADIOPAQUE MATERIALS BY THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR FOR TUMOR IMAGING. DURING THE COURSE OF THESE PHS-SUPPORTED INVESTIGATIONS, THE FOLLOWING TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES WERE RESOLVED: (1) CONTROL OF PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTION; (2) STABILIZATION OF SUSPENSIONS IN VITRO AND IN VIVO; (3) SELECTIVE DELIVERY TO LIVER AND SPLEEN (NOT BONE MARROW) FOLLOWING INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION OF PARTICULATE CONTRAST MATERIAL. THE METHODOLOGY PROPOSED IN THIS PHASE I APPLICATION IS ANALOGOUS TO THE ABOVE-CITED RESEARCH AND COULD, THEREFORE, BE INITIATED IMMEDIATELY. SPECIFIC GOALS OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE: (1) DETERMINATION OF SOLUBILITIES FOR SELECTED COMPOUNDS IN PSS, PLASMA AND SEVERAL ORGANIC SOLVENTS; (2) PREPARATION OF PARTICLES WITH DESIRED SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS: (3) DETERMINATION OF THE TENDENCY FOR PARTICLE AGGREGATION IN BLOOD; (4) EVALUATION OF THE USE OF ALBUMIN IN PREVENTING PARTICLE AGGREGATION. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PHASE I RESEARCH IS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT STABLE SUSPENSIONS OF APPROPRIATELY-SIZED PARTICLES CAN BE FORMULATED WITH ONE OR MORE ANTINEOPLASTIC COMPOUNDS. IMPORTANT QUESTIONS OF EFFICACY AND TOXICITY IN EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS WILL BE ADDRESSED IN THE SUBSEQUENT PHASE II APPLICATION.

THE PROBLEM IS TO PRODUCE SUCH A MATERIAL, WHICH MAY CONTAIN >20,000 FILAMENTS, IN THE MOST ECONOMICAL WAY POSSIBLE. THE LARGE NUMBER OF MAGNETS INVOLVED IN THE SSC MAKES EVEN SMALL SAVINGS IN THE MATERIAL VERY VALUABLE IN THE OVERALL COST OF THE MACHINE ONE WAY TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED PROPERTIES IS TO HYDROSTATICALLY EXTRUDE AT LOW TEMPERATURES, BUT UNFORTUNATELY NO LARGE HYDROSTATIC EXTRUSION PRESS EXSTS INT EXISTS IN THE UNITED STATES. ALSO THE VOLUME OF MATERIAL THAT CAN BE PROCESSED BY THE LARGES PRESENT-DAY HYDROSTATIC PRESS IN A SINGLE OPERATION IS SMALLER, AND THE PROCESSING COSTS HIGHER, THAN WHEN CONVENTIONAL EXTRUSION PRESSES ARE USED. CONVERSION OF EXISTING CONVENTINAL PRESSES TO HYDROSTATIC O OPERATION IS DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE. THIS INVESTIGATIN INVESTIGATION IS TO MODIFY THE BILLET PREHEATING CYCLE AND THE BILLET DESIGN TO CAUSE THE MATERA THE BILLET DESIGN TO CAUSE THE MATERIAL TO EXPERIENCE CONDITIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE EXISTING IN LOW TEMPERATURE HYDROSTATIC EXTRUSION. THIS WILL BE DONE BY RAPIDLY PREHEATING THE BILLET AND BY THERMALLY INSULATING THE OUTER COPPER PORTION FROM A THIN-WALLED INNER CAN CONTAINING THE NBTI FILAMENTS DURING THIS PREHEATING. IT WILL THEN BE POSSIBLE TO RAISE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE OUTER PORTION OF THE ABOVE THE CORE AND ENABLE THE FORMER TO ACT AS A PSUEDO-HYDROSTATIC MEDIUM. PRECOMPACTION ALSO IS USED WHEN VERY LARGE NUMBERS OF FILAMENTS AND HIGH CURRENT DENSITIES ARE REEQUIRED. THIS PRECOMPACTION IS NORMALLY DONE IN A SEPARATEE OPERATION, BUT IN THIS PROPOSAL THE BILLET IS DESIGNED SO THAT THE OPERATION CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED IN THE EXTRUSION PRESS LINER IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE BILLET IS EXTRUDED. THUS, THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT WILL BE MAINTAINED BY LOW-TEMPERATURE, PSEUDO-HYDROSTATIC PROCESSING, AND THE COST WILL BE REDUCED IN TWO WYS^ (1) BY MAINTAINING LARGE BILLET VOLUME, AND (2) BY SIMULTANEOUSLY PRECOMPACTING AND EXTRUDING.",

THE ACCELERATING APERTURE OF THESE ELECTRODES WILL BE CHOSEN SO THAT A FIELD-EMITTED ELECTRON ALWAYS STRIKES THE NEXT ELECTRODE, WHEREAS A FIELD-EMITTED OR ELECTRON- SPUTTERED POSITIVE IRON TRAVELS WITHOUT FURTHER COLLISION INTO AN ION/ELECTRON TRAP PLACED IN A FIELD-FREE REGION AT INTERVALS ALONG THE ACCELERATOR TUBE.

THE INTERGAP INSULATORS ARE DESIGNED USING TWO NOVEL PRINCIPLES: THE ELECTRODE DIRECTION AT THE INSULATOR IS AT AN ANGLE TO THE TUBE AXIS (INSTEAD OF NORMAL AS IN PREVIOUS DESIGNS); AND THE VACUUM SIDE INSULATOR CONTOUR IS CHOSEN SO THAT IONS OR ELECTRONS LEAVING THE INSULATOR SURFACE DO NOT STRIKE THE INSULATOR AGAIN, THUS ELIMINATING THE \"ELECTRON MULTIPLIER\" EFFECT THAT CAUSES PATCHES OF CHARGE, AN ATTENDANT NONUNIFORM POTENTIAL GRADIENT, TO APPEAR ON CONVENTIONAL INSULATOR SURFACES.

THIS EFFORT WOULD BE BUILT UPON KNOWLEDGE GAINED OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PASSIVE MOBILE RESTRAINT SYSTEM FOR A LOCAL NURSING HOME. IN THAT SYSTEM, A PATIENT CAN BE TETHERED TO A MOBILE REEL SYSTEM ATTACHED TO A MONORAIL ON THE CEILING AND THE REEL CAN APPLY A VARIABLE BRAKING FORCE TO PREVENT A FALL. THIS PROPOSED EFFORT WOULD ENCOMPASS THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ACTIVE MOBILE RESTRAINING SYSTEM WHICH SHOULD HAVE BOTH GREATER CAPABILITY AND APPLICATION.

THE DEVICE WOULD USE THE ENERGY STORED IN A VOLUME OF WATER COMPRESSED TO VERY HIGH PRESSURES TO GENERATE A POWERFUL HYDRAULIC SHOCK WITHIN A CAVITY DRILLED INTO A ROCK FACE.

THESE IMAGES WILL BE GENERATED BY MEANS OF A NON-LINEAR ALGORITHM THAT DIRECTLY RELATES MICROWAVE RADIANCES TO WIND, VAPOR, AND RAIN. NEW FORECASTING TECHNIQUES WILL BE DEVELOPED THAT USE THE WVR IMAGES IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER METEOROLOGICAL DATA SETS. THE FINAL OBJECTIVE IS TO TEST THE WVR IMAGE FORECASTING TECHNIQUES IN A REAL-TIME ENVIRONMENT AND COMPARE THE RESULTS WITH THE OFFICIAL NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE FORECASTS.",

A PROTOTYPE MATH MODELING CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM AND MATH MODEL EXECUTION PROGRAM WILL BE DEVELOPED. THIS WORK IS AN EXTENSION OF MICROSOSM R&D; ON MATH MODELING SOFTWARE FOR SCIENCE AND ENG INEERING. WITH THIS SYSTEM THE NUMBER OF LINES OF CODE TO BEWRITTEN AND TESTED TO CREATE A FLEXIBLE, STUDENT-FRIENDLY, EASY-TO-USE MATH MODEL SHOULD NORMALLY BE REDUCED BY A A FACTOR OF 10 TO 100. THIS, ALONG WITH OTHER FEATURES, SHOULDREDUCE BY MORE THAN AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE THE TIME REQUIRED TO DEVELOP HIGH SCHOOL MATH MODELING COURSEWARE. IN ADDITON , THE RESULTING MODELS WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE POWERFUL THAN MOST EXISTING COURSEWARE. THEY WILL ALLOW EXECUTION OFMULTIPLE MODELS SIMULTANEOUSLY, EITHER FORWARD OR IN REVERSEINTERRUPTING AT ANY POINT TO ALLOW EXAMINATION OF INTER MEDIATE RESULTS, WITH FULLY AUTOMATIC UNITS CONVERSION FOR ALL INPUT AND OUTPUT SO THAT THE PROBLEM CAN BE DONE IN UNITS MOST EASILY UNDERSTOOD BY THE STUDENT. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS SOFTWARE CAN HELP THE STUDENT GAIN FAR MORE PHYSICAL INSIGHT THAN PREVIOUSLY POSSIBLE INTO BOTH THE LAWS OF NATURE AND THE PROCESS OF SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION.",
