        "abstract": "Abstract Creare will develop a compressor that works atcryogenic temperatures: 80K or nearly 350 degress below zero fahrenheit. The compressor works at high pressures for Joule-Thompson (J-T cryocoolers. J-T cryocoolers contain heat exhangers and expansion elements that are orders of magnitude smaller than Reverse Brayton or Stirling cryocoolers. Further, J-T cryocoolers contain no active components in the cold end. Hence, in theory, they can reach a high efficiency. Exclusive of the compressor a one-stage J-T can attain 50% of Carnot, while a 3-stage J-T goes up to 75% of Carnot. Unfortunately, J-T cryocoolers have a weak link: the compressor. Today's high pressure compressors use lubricants and rubbing seals that contaminate the cooling system gas, which in turn causes the J-T restrictor to clog and fail. Hence, gas cleanup systems must be installed downstream, but they need frequent maintenance, and will not function properly in space. This project will develop a new compressor that has no rubbing seals and needs no lubricants. Thus, it won't clog the restrictor, and it removes the need for a gas cleanup system. It also increases the efficiency make it a candidate for cooling space sensor systems. The compressor can also serve in coolers for portable night vision systems that use only a fraction of a watt. Other applications are closed-cycle J-T recondenscers for MRI systems, and miniature refrigerators for superconducting devices.",

BY USING A PULSED ELECTRON SOURCE, FOIL HEATING IS MINIMIZED AND HIGH-PEAK CURRENTS CAN BE OBTAINED. THE RADIATION PRODUCED CAN BE IN THE WARM (5 TO 15 KEV) AND HARD (>15 KEV) X-RAY REGIONS OF THE SPECTRUM DEPENDING UPON THE FOIL MATERIAL USED, THE FOIL THICKNESS, AND THE ELECTRON-BEAM ENERGY.

THIS SIMPLE, ONE-STEP METHOD IS CALLED AN OPTICAL BIOASSAY (OBA) AND UTILIZES AN INEXPENSIVE LASER AND PHOTODETECTOR TO DETECT AN ANTIGEN-ANTIBODY BINDING EVENT. ANTIBODY IS COVALENTLY ATTACHED TO A SILICON SURFACE AND TREATED WITH A PROPRIETARY PHOTOLITHOGRAPHIC TECHNIQUE TO PRODUCE ALTERNATING ROWS OF IMMUNOREACTIVE AND NON-IMMUNOREACTIVE ANTIBODY. WHEN A NARROW LASER LIGHT BEAM IS DIRECTED AT THE ANTIBODY COATED SILICON SURFACE, THE LIGHT IS REFLECTED AT ITS INCIDENT ANGLE WITHOUT DIFFRACTION. WHEN ANTIGEN BINDS TO THE IMMUNOREACTIVE (BUT NOT TO THE NONIMMUNOREACTIVE ANTIBODY) A BIOLOGICAL GRID IS CREATED. WHEN LIGHT IS DIRECTED AT THE REACTED SURFACE, THE BIOLOGICAL GRID PRODUCES A DIFFRACTION SIGNAL WHICH IS EASILY DETECTED WITH THE INTENSITY OF THE DIFFRACTION BEING PROPORTIONAL TO THE NUMBER OF SPECIFIC ANTIGEN-ANTIBODY EVENTS ON THE CHIP. FINALLY, THE SOPHISTICATED BUT SIMPLE SYNTHESIS OF MICROELECTRONICS AND BIOTECHNOLOGY MAKES THIS IMMUNODIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM EXTREMELY PORTABLE AND SUITABLE FOR USE IN NON-LABORATORY SETTINGS SUCH AS PHYSICIAN'S OFFICE OR FIELD TESTING.",

WHILE MOST WORK ON MILD GASIFICATION IS ADDRESSING DENSE PHASE REACTORS OR LARGE PARTICLES, SEVERAL LABORATORIES REPORT THAT FLASH PYROLYSIS USING SMALL PARTICLES IN DISPERSED-PHASE REACTORS PRODUCES A HIGHER YIELD (SOMETIMES TWO TO THREE TIMES HIGHER) THAN FIXED-BED PYROLYSIS. THIS PROJECT PROPOSES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MILD GASIFICATION PROCESS BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF TRANSPORT OR FAST FLUIDIZED BED REACTORS. THE MILD GASIFICATION TRANSPORT REACTOR WOULDBE COUPLED IN A LOOP TO A SECOND REACTOR WHICH WOULD BE USED FOR COMBUSTION OR GASIFICATION. FOR THE PURPOSE OF MILD GASIFICATION WITH MAXIMUM LIQUIDS PRODUCTION, THE TRANSPORT REACTOR IS IDEAL, HAVING THE FOLLOWING ADVANTAGES:I) VERY RAPID HEATING OF THE COAL FEED BECAUSE OF THE EXTREME AGITATION OF THE SOLIDS; II) SHORT GAS RESIDENCE TIME TO SWEEP THE LIQUIDS IMMEDIATELY OUT OF THE REACTOR, THUS, MINIMIZING SECONDARY REACTIONS TO MAXIMIZE LIQUID YIELDS; III) ADJUSTABLE SOLIDS RESIDENCE TIME TO ALLOW COMPLETE DEVOLATILIZATION AT THE OPTIMUM TEMPERATURE (PROBABLY BETWEEN 600 DEGREES CENTIGRADE AND 750 DEGREES CENTIGRADE); IV) EXTREME TEMPERATURE UNIFORMITY THROUGHOUT THE BED; V) THE ABILITY TO HANDLE CAKING COALS BECAUSE OF THE VIGOROUS MOTION OF THE SOLIDS; AND VI) HIGH PROCESSING CAPACITY IN A SMALL DIAMETER VESSEL. THE PRODUCTS OF THE MILD GASIFICATION TRANSPORT REACTOR WILL BE A HIGHLY REACTIVE CHAR AND A HIGH YIELD OF LIQUIDS. THE CHAR WILL BEGASIFIED OR BURNED IN A SECOND REACTOR. WE PROPOSE TO OPTIMIZE THE REACTOR SYSTEM SO THAT THE HEAVIEST LIQUIDS CANBE USED FOR HIGH VALUE CARBON MATERIALS SUCH AS FIBERS AND GASKETS, AND THE LIGHTER FRACTIONS UPGRADED FOR LIQUID FUELS. IN PHASE I WE WILL EMPLOY THE CONTRACTOR'S EXISTING LABORATORY FACILITIES TO SIMULATE THE CONDITIONS IN A TRANSPORT REACTOR AND IN THIS WAY DETERMINE THE CONDITIONS NEEDED TO OPTIMIZE THE PRODUCT YIELDS AND QUALITIES. WE WILL ALSO EXPLORE PRETREATMENTS OF THE COAL AND EVALUATE ADDITIVES TO THE REACTOR WHICH IMPROVE YIELD AND PRODUCT QUALITIES. ON THE BASIS OF THESE DATA WE WILL EMPLOY THE CONTRACTORS COAL CONVERSION MODEL, FG-DVC AS THE BASIS FOR AN ENGINEERING MODEL OF THE REACTIONS IN THE TRANSPORT REACTOR EMPLOYING LITERATURE INFORMATION ON SOLID AND GAS RESIDENCE TIMES. WE WILL USE THIS ENGINEERING MODEL TO FULLY EVALUATE THE PROCESS CONCEPT AND TO DESIGN A CONTINUOUS FLOW REACTOR TO BE BUILT AND TESTED IN PHASE II.",

THE TECHNIQUE EMPLOYS SMALL LOCAL MODULATION OF THE TEMPERATURE OF THE SURFACE TO BE MEASURED AND DETECTION OF THE MODULATED SURFACE RADIATION. THE MODULATION RADIATION EXCLUDES RADIATION REFLECTED FROM OTHERPARTS OF THE EQUIPMENT, AND THE SPECTRAL SHAPE OF THE INTENSITY OF THIS MODULATED RADIATION IS A FUNCTION OF THE SURFACE TEMPERATURE.

WHILE SOLAR INCINERATION OFFERS SIGNIFICANT PROMISE AS A WASTE DISPOSAL TECHNOLOGY, THERE IS A STRONG NEED FOR ON-LINE AND IN-SITU DIAGNOSTICS DURING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROCESS AND FOR EVENTUAL USE IN PROCESS CONTROL. THE INNOVATION OFFERED IN THIS PROPOSAL IS THE APPLICATION FOR FOURIER TRANSFORM INFRARED (FT-IR) SPECTROSCOPY TO MAKE THREE KINDS OF MEASUREMENTS IN A SOLAR INCINERATOR: 1) HIGH SENSITIVITY MEASUREMENTS (PPB LEVELS) OF THE PRODUCT STREAM TO VERIFY THE DESTRUCTION OF THE HAZARDOUS WASTE, 2) MEASUREMENTS OF SPECIES CONCENTRATIONS AND TEMPERATURES WITHIN THE REACTOR ENVIRONMENT, AND 3) MEASUREMENT OF TEMPERATURES OF SURFACES IN THE REACTOR. FOR THE PRODUCT STREAM ANALYSIS, THE PHASE I PROJECT WILL PERFORM LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS TO DETERMINE THE CONCENTRATION DETECTION LIMITS FOR IMPORTANT HAZARDOUS WASTES AND PICS. FOR THE IN-SITU DIAGNOSTICS, WE WILL DETERMINE THE GEOMETRY REQUIRED FOR THE MEASUREMENTS AND PERFORM LABORATORY SIMULATIONS OF THESE MEASUREMENTS.

THIS TEST PROGRAM CONFIRMED THE ASH EFFECTIVENESS WITH THE SEPARATION EFFICIENCIES EQUIVALENT TOTHOSE ACHIEVED BY ADVANCED CONVENTIONAL FLOTATION, BUT AT A SPECIFIC CAPACITY MORE THAN 300 TIMES HIGHER THAN CONVENTIONAL OR COLUMN FLOTATION. HOWEVER, THE TEST PROGRAMALSO REVEALS THAT PYRITE REJECTION DURING BOTH ADVANCED CONVENTIONAL FLOTATION AND ASH FLOTATION STILL REMAINS A CHALLENGE. RECENTLY, ADVANCED PROCESSING TECHNOLOGIES, INC. HAS ANNOUNCED A FURTHER DEVELOPMENT IN ASH DESIGN WITH PROPRIETARY FROTH WASHING SYSTEM FOR IMPROVED REJECTION OF THE ASH AND PYRITIC SULFUR CONTAMINANTS IN THE CLEAN COAL PRODUCT. THE FROTH WASHER IS LOCATED ON THE AXIS OF THE ASHUNIT IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE FROTH PRODUCT FORMED IN THE CENTER OF THE ASH HAS TO PASS THROUGH A WATER SPRAY BEFORE THE FROTH ENTERS THE VORTEX FINDER AND IS DISCHARGED AS AN OVERFLOW PRODUCT. FINE MINERAL PARTICLES INCLUDING PYRITE PARTICLES INADVERTENTLY TRAPPED IN THE FROTH PHASE THUS SHOULD BE REJECTED BEFORE THEY ENTER INTO THE VORTEX FINDER AND BEFORE THEY ARE DISCHARGED WITH THE CLEAN COAL PRODUCT.

THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUE IS BASED ON X-RAY COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY.IT IS INNOVATIVE BECAUSE IT DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT ANY GAPS IN THE DEBOND AREA BE RESOLVED. INSTEAD, IT RELIES ON MEASUREMENTS OF THE PROPELLANT DILATATION NEAR THE BONDED INTERFACE TO SHOW WHETHER LOAD TRANSFER IS OCCURRING ACROSS THE BOND. THE DILTATION IS MEASURED USING STATISTICAL MEASURES OF THE TEXTURE OF THE PROPELLANT IN THE CT IMAGE. SIMPLE METHODS BASED ON FIRST ORDER STATISTICS (HISTOGRAMS)HAVE ALREADY SHOWN THAT STRAIN CAN BE MEASURED TO WITHIN 40% USING STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES. WE PROPOSE TO MEASURE MORE DETAILED STATISTICS OF THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DATA AT DIFFERENT IMAGE POINTS TO INCREASE THE ACCURACY OF THE TECHNIQUE. THE EFFORT WILL BE THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROTOTYPE SOFTWARE TO EXTRACT THE STATISTICAL INFORMATION, ACQUISITION OF CT IMAGE DATA ON ANALOG SPECIMENS FABRICATED WITH KNOWN DEBONDS, AND QUANTIFICATION OF THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE TOOLS.",

A SET OF TESTABLE HYPOTHESES WILL BE EXTRACTED FROM THIS THEORY CONCERNING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MILITARY TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE FACTORS AND SUPERIOR TACTICAL DECISION PERFORMANCE BY EXPERTS. IN THE LONGER TERM, PHASE II OF THIS RESEARCH WILL BE A SOLID THEORY-BASED EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM THAT WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESE DEVELOPED IN THE FIRST PHASE.",

THE CURRENT E-3 SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM HAS A RADAR AND AN IFF SYSTEM. HOSTILE TARGETS ARE UNLIKELY TO BE DETECTED BY THE IFF SYSTEM; THE EMERGENCE OF LOW-OBSERVABLE TECHNOLOGY WILL MAKE IT DIFFICULT EVEN FOR THE RADAR TO DETECT THEM. THIS INDICATES THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SENSORS SUCH AS AN ESM TO IMPROVE THE MISSION EFFECTIVENESS OF THE E-3; HOWEVER, UNLESS THE INFORMATION FROM ALL SENSORS IS FUSED, THE AIR PICTURE WILL NOT IMPROVE DUE TO THE MULTIPLICITY OF TRACKS PRODUCED FOR EACH TARGET BY THE DIFFERENT SENSORS. ALPHATECH PROPOSES TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM BY FIRST DERIVING THE MATHEMATICALLY OPTIMAL SOLUTION FOR FUSING DATA FROM MULTIPLE SENSOR TO DEVELOP A UNIFIED PICTURE OF THE TARGET TRACKS AND IDENTITIES. WE WILL THEN DEVELOP A PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION BY INCORPORATING HEURISTICS WITHIN THIS OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS. USING AN ALGORITHM ALREADY DEVELOPED FOR A RELATED AIRBORNE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM, WE WILL DEVELOP A PROTOTYPE OF SUCH A FUSION ALGORITHM AND DEMONSTRATE IT WITH SIMULATED DATA.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE INSPECTION OF VERY LARGE CRUDE CARRIERS (VLCC) FOR STRUCTURAL RELIABILITY IS AN IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERN. THESE LARGE VESSELS TRANSPORT CRUDE OIL IN SUCH QUANTITIES THAT THE CONSEQUENCE OF AN OIL SPILL DUE TO A BROKEN WELD ARE VERY SERIOUS. IMPROVED TECHNIQUES ARE NEEDED TO INSPECT VLCC TANKS FOR DEFECTS SUCH AS CRACKS IN SEAMS, CORROSION AND FAILED STRUCTURAL MEMBERS. THE COST OF INSPECTION IS HIGH BECAUSE THE SHIP MUST BE TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE AND BROUGHT TO A REPAIR FACILITY. AMERICAN RESEARCH CORPORATION OF VIRGINIA PROPOSES TO REMEDY THIS SITUATION BYDEVELOPING A ROBOTIC SYSTEM INCORPORATING MAGNETIC EDDY CURRENT AND VIDEO CAMERA INSPECTION. SIGNALS DUE TO COLD WORKING OF METAL COMPONENTS WILL BE USED TO ASSESS THE DAMAGE STATE OF TANK MATERIALS. THE PROGRAM IS INNOVATIVE IN APPLYING SCANNING EDDY CURRENT AND SIGNAL ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES TO ACHIEVE THE PHASE I OBJECTIVE OF DEVELOPING ANEDDY CURRENT SCANNING SYSTEMS, FABRICATING WELDED SAMPLES, COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS OF DATA AND SPECIFICATION OF A REMOTE INSPECTION SYSTEM FOR TANK EVALUATION. PHASE I WILL CONSIST OF A PROOF-OF-PRINCIPAL DEMONSTRATION OF THE EDDY CURRENT INSPECTION AND SPECIFICATION OF THE ROBOTIC SYSTEM. THE PHASE II PROGRAM WILL INVOLVE DEMONSTRATION OF A PROTOTYPE SYSTEM ON A MOCK-UP OIL CARRIER TANK.",

A BYPRODUCT OF ESTABLISHING THE ACE-SUPPRESSOR INTERFACE METHODOLOGY IS AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE ACE MODEL AND HOW IT CAN BE INTERFACED TO OTHER ENTITIES IN ADDITION TO SUPPRESSOR. PHASE \"IA\" MATCHING GRANTS FROM NEW YORK STATE WILL CONTINUE THE STUDY. A TOP-DOWN DESIGN OF THE ACE-SUPPRESSOR INTERFACE WILL BE DEVELOPED. ADDITIONALLY, BASED ON KNOWLEDGE OBTAINED IN PHASE I, AN INTERFACE METHODOLOGY BETWEEN ACE AND A TERRAIN MASKING DATA BASE WILL BE ESTABLISHED.",

AN INTELLIGENT ON-BOARD SYSTEM IS NEEDED TO INTEGRATE, ORGANIZE AND PRIORITIZE EVER-INCREASING TACTICAL DATA, TO AID IN COMPLEX TERRAIN ANALYSIS AND INTERVISIBILITY TASKS, AND TO ASSIST IN TACTICAL DECISION MAKING PROCESSES. TO PERFORM THE PROPOSED WORK, IT IS NECESSARY THAT THE KEY PERSONNEL BE WELL-VERSED IN FOUR AREAS OF TECHNOLOGICAL ACTIVITY THAT ARE RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH A SYSTEM: COMPUTER-GENERATED MAPS, DIGITAL DATA LINKS, GROUND-BASED MISSION PLANNING AIDS, AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. ANALYSES OF THESE TECHNOLOGICAL AREAS MUST BE CONDUCTED IN THE LIGHT OF ARMY IN-FLIGHT DECISION-MAKING REQUIREMENTS.A DETAILED STUDY EFFORT WILL IDENTIFY THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF AN ON-BOARD, KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEM FOR ARMY USE, AND PROTOTYPE DEVELOPMENT WILL INCLUDE DESCRIPTIONS OF CONTENT AND FORMAT OF THE DISPLAYED INFORMATION, AND SPECIFICATION OF THE HIGH-PAYOFF APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THIS SETTING.

SHRIMP POND WATER IS PUMPED THROUGH FLUIDIZED OYSTER COLUMNS, PASSED THOUGH SEDIMENTATION TANKS,AND RETURNED TO THE POND. WHEN FED TO OYSTERS, THE ALGAE- LADEN POND WATER CAN PRODUCE MARKET-SIZE OYSTERS IN LESS THAN 200 DAYS. IN THE FLUIDIZED COLUMNS, THE OYSTERS ARE SUSPENDED IN THE WATER, FREE TO FEED AND GROW WITHOUT INTERFERENCE FROM EACH OTHER. THE OYSTERS REMOVE ALGAE AND THE SEDIMENTATION TANK REMOVES OYSTER FECES AND LARGE PARTICULATES FROM THE WATER BEFORE IT IS RETURNED TO THE POND. THE USE OF SHRIMP POND EFFLUENT ELIMINATES THE COST OF PRODUCING OYSTER FEED AND GREATLY REDUCES SHRIMP WASTE MANAGEMENT COSTS. THE USE OF FLUIDIZED TECHNOLOGY INCREASESFACILITY UTILIZATION EFFICIENCY AND GREATLY REDUCES LABOR COSTS. THE SHARING OF PONDS REDUCES INVESTMENT FOR PRODUCTION OF BOTH SHRIMP AND OYSTERS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO OBTAIN DATA ON THE EFFICIENCY WITH WHICH OYSTERS OF DIFFERING SIZES CAN REMOVE ALGAE FROM THE FEED WATER AND THE ABILITY OF A BIOLOGICALLY COMPLEX SYSTEM TO MAINTAIN STABILITY.

THIS CONCEPT OFFERS A SIMPLE, LOW COST, UNIFORM, AND HOMOGENEOUS TEST CHARGE THROUGH THE USE OF A CONSUMABLE CONTAINER, WHICH ITSELF TAKES PART IN THE DETONATION PROCESS ELIMINATING CONTAINER DEBRIS AS A TEST ENVIRONMENT CONTAMINANT. THIS CONCEPT USES A FIBER REINFORCED BLASTING AGENT HELD IN A RUBBER LIKE MATRIX TO ACHIEVE A CONTAINER HAVING STRUCTURAL STRENGTH, WHICH ASSUMES THE DESIRED HE CHARGE GEOMETRIC CONFIGURATION WHEN FILLED WITH BLASTING AGENT (ANFO). THE CONTAINER CONSTRUCTION IS MUCH LIKE THAT OF A LARGE LOW PRESSURE TIRE. THE HIGH STRENGTH, HYDROCARBON, CONTAINER REINFORCING FIBERS WILL BE LARGELY CONSUMED DURING THE BLAST AND, IN ANY EVENT, WILL NOT FORM LARGE PARTICLES. INERT COMPONENTS WILL CONSTITUTE LESS THAN 0.2% OF THE TOTAL HE CHARGE. THE COMPLIANT CONTAINER ALSO PERMITS SIMPLE LOW COST FOOTINGS FOR GROUND MOUNTED CHARGES, AND SIMPLE SUSPENDED CHARGE SYSTEMS. IN SUMMARY, THE ARES TEAM CONCEPT PROVIDES A TECHNIQUE WHEREBY HE SIMULATION CHARGES CAN SUPPORT A WIDE VARIETY OF CONFIGURATIONS AND PROVIDE THE EFFECT OF A HOMOGENEOUS COMPLETELY BARE CHARGE WITH THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF A CONTAINED CHARGE.",

THE MEASUREMENT OF THE IOP AT THE PATIENT'S HOME HAS BEEN ADVOCATED BUT HAS BEEN HAMPERED BY THE LACK OF AN INSTRUMENT THAT CAN BE USED RELIABLY AND SAFELY BY THE PATIENT ALONE. A SELF-TONOMETER, RECENTLY DEVELOPED BY ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS, HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED IN CLINICAL RESEARCH. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO MAKE THE SELF-TONOMETER AVAILABLE TO THE OPHTHALMIC COMMUNITY BY CONVERTING THE PROTOTYPE INTO A COMMERCIAL PRODUCT. PHASE I WILL CONSIST OF INTRODUCING A MICROPROCESSOR TO CONTROL THE OPERATION, REGISTER AND CHECK THE READINGS, PROVIDE FEEDBACK TO PATIENT, AND ARCHIVE THE IOP, TIME, AND DATE UNTIL THE DATA ARE PROCESSED AT THE CLINICIAN'S OFFICE. A COMPUTER-CONTROLLED PRESSURE GENERATOR WILL ALSO BE DEVELOPED. THE UPGRADED VERSION WILL BE TESTED AND ITS FUNCTION COMPARED TO THAT OF THE EXISTING PROTOTYPE.

        "abstract": "Abstract         COMMERCIAL DISCOVERIES OF OIL AND GAS DEPOSITS IN U.S. DOMESTIC WATERS, PRINCIPALLY GULF OF MEXICO, ARE MOVING TO SIGNIFICANTLY DEEPER WATERS (OVER 400 FT.) AS SHALLOW WATER RESERVES ARE BEING DEPLETED. DEEPWATER EXPLORATION IS CURRENTLY UNDERTAKEN PRIMARILY BY MAJOR OIL COMPANIES, DUE TO ITS VERY HIGH COST. THESE COMPANIES MUST DISCOVER OIL AND GAS FIELDS WITH LARGE RESERVES TO JUSTIFY THE LARGE CAPITAL EXPENDITURE NEEDED TO ESTABLISH COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION. THE VALUE OF THESE RESERVES IS DISCOUNTED BY THE LONG TIME REQUIRED TO BEGIN PRODUCTION USING CURRENT TECHNOLOGY. AT A TIME WHEN PETROLEUM IMPORTS ARE INCREASING DAILY AND SECURE DOMESTIC SUPPLIES ARE FALLING, ATLANTIA INTENDS TO DEVELOP A SYSTEM TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE COST AND TIME REQUIRED TO PRODUCE A DEEPWATER GAS AND CONDENSATE DISCOVERY. SUCH REDUCTIONS OF COST AND TIME TO FIRST PRODUCTION WILL MAKE IT COMMERCIALLY ATTRACTIVE TO PRODUCE MANY SMALLER FIELDS WHICH WOULD NOT BE DEVELOPED WITH CONVENTIONAL TECHNOLOGY. AN INCREASE IN DOMESTIC ENERGY SUPPLY, MADE POSSIBLE BY SUCH TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCE, WOULD HELP TO REDUCE THE COST OF NATURAL GAS ACQUISITION BY THE ULTIMATE USER. PHASE I PROJECT WORK FOCUSES ON EVALUATING THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THE NOVEL PRODUCTION SYSTEM CONFIGURATION AS ITRESPONDS DYNAMICALLY TO APPLIED ENVIRONMENTAL LOADS. SUBSIDIARY TASKS INCLUDE DEMONSTRATING THAT THE PRODUCTION SYSTEM CAN BE CONSTRUCTED AND OPERATED USING AVAILABLE GULF COAST INFRASTRUCTURE.",

THE ADVANTAGE OVER CURRENT MONOPULSE SIGNAL PROCESSING CONCEPTS IS THAT THE EFFECTS OF LASER SPECKLE ARE DECOUPLED FROM THE ANGLE MEASUREMENT. PHASE I CONSISTED OF BOTH ANALYSIS AND SIMULATION WHICH PRODUCED A FOUNDATION OF UNDERSTANDING FOR PHASE II. THE ANGLE ESTIMATION ALGORITHM WHICH IS BEING DEVELOPED, BASED ON MEASUREMENTS TO BE CONDUCTED DURING PHASE II, WILL PROCESS BOTH THE RELATIVE AMPLITUDE AND RELATIVE PHASE OF THE RETURN SIGNAL FOR ADJACENT DETECTOR CHANNELS. THE TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS BEING DEVELOPED MAY BE APPLIED TO APPLICATIONS AS DIVERSE AS STRATEGIC TARGET WEAPONS SYSTEM FIRE CONTROL AND TRACKING THE RANDOM, INVOLUNTARY MOTIONS OF EYES FOR EXAMINATION AND SURGICAL APPLICATIONS.",

THIS IMPORTANCE IS MANIFESTED IN THE NEED TO CONTROL THE MATERIALS AND SYSTEMS MANUFACTURING PROCESS AND TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF EXPOSURE OF MATERIALS TO GROUNDHANDLING AND THE SPACE ENVIRONMENT. CURRENT INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING SPECTRAL REFLECTANCE PROPERTIES OF MATERIALS ARE LABORATORY DEVICES THAT PROVIDE HIGH RESOLUTION TEST MEASUREMENTS FOR SMALL DISCRETE SAMPLES.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP THE CONCEPTUAL AND FUNCTIONAL DESIGN FOR A PORTABLE SPECTROREFLECTOMETER TO MEASURE SPECTRAL REFLECTANCE OF EXTENDED SURFACES. THIS INSTRUMENT USES A PRISM MONOCHROMETER AND AN INTEGRATING SPHERE TO PROVIDE TOTAL HEMISPHERICAL REFLECTANCE MEASUREMENTS FROM 0.25 TO 2.5 MICROMETERS.

THE DIFFERENTIAL WILL ALLOW ACCESS THROUGH THE WRIST FOR HAND ACTUATION. THE WRIST WILL BE BUILT INTEGRALLY WITH THE FOREARM FOR MODULAR CONNECTION TO THE MIT WHOLE-ARM MANIPULATOR, ROBOTICS RESEARCH ARM (BOTH BEING EVALUATED BY NASA/JSC FOR EVA HELPER AND EVA RETRIEVER PROGRAMS), OR OTHER IN WHICH THE EXISTING FOREARM IS MODULAR. PHASE I CONSISTS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF A DESIGN CONCEPT INCLUDING WRIST PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS, DETERMINATION OF THE KINEMATICS, AND IDENTIFICATION (THOUGH NOT DETAILED DESIGN) OF KEY ACTUATION-COMPONENT MECHANISMS. IN PHASE II, THE REQUIRED COMPONENT MECHANISMS WILL BE DEVELOPED AND INTEGRATED INTO A WORKING WRIST PROTOTYPE.

FUTURE REGULATIONS MAY LIMIT CURRENT DISPOSAL METHODS AND FURTHER INCREASE DISPOSAL COSTS OF FISHWASTES. REDUCTION OF THE MOISTURE CONTENT OF THE FISH WASTEMATERIALS MAY PROVIDE A MORE ECONOMICALLY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND MANNER OF FISH WASTE DISPOSAL. A BENCH TEST WILL BE CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE OPERATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF A FILTER PRESS SYSTEM USED TO DEWATER FISH WASTE MATERIAL. FISH WASTE FROM YELLOW PERCH AND RAINBOW TROUT WILL BE TESTED TO DETERMINE IF WASTE FROM DIFFERENT SPECIES REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE FILTER PRESS SYSTEM.

FISH WASTE MATERIAL BEFORE FILTRATION, THE FILTRATE AND THE FILTER CAKE WILL BE ANALYZED FOR SOLIDS, TOTAL NITROGEN, TOTAL PHOSPHOROUS, AND BIOCHEMICAL OXYGEN DEMAND (BOD). AFTER SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS RESEARCH, THE AQUACULTURE INDUSTRY WILL BE ABLE TO LOWER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH FISH WASTE DISPOSAL, THROUGH THE USE OF A FILTER PRESS SYSTEM.

UNFORTUNATELY, FULLY 25% OF KNOWN U.S. GAS RESERVES ARE CONTAMINATED WITH NITROGEN TO THE EXTENT THE GAS CANNOT BE USED WITHOUT PROCESSING TO REDUCE THE CONCENTRATION OF NITROGEN. NO TECHNOLOGY EXISTS TODAY FOR THE COST-EFFECTIVE REMOVAL OF NITROGEN FROM NATURAL GAS AT THE WELLHEAD. BEND RESEARCH PROPOSES TO DEVELOP AN ECONOMICAL, EFFICIENT PROCESS FOR PRODUCING PIPELINE-SPEC NATURAL GAS FROM N2-CONTAMINATED GAS AT THE WELLHEAD. IN THIS PROCESS, THE N2 WILL BE SEPARATED FROM THE NATURAL GAS VIA A NOVEL LIQUID ABSORBENT. THIS ABSORBENT WILL HAVE A HIGH AFFINITY FOR NITROGEN AND LITTLE OR NO AFFINITY FOR METHANE OR ANY OTHER HYDROCARBONS PRESENT. A GAS/LIQUID CONTACTOR WILL BE USED TO BRING THE N2-LADEN NATURAL GAS IN CONTACT WITH THE ABSORBENT UNDER CONDITIONS THAT FAVOR ABSORPTION OF NITROGEN (HIGH NITROGEN PARTIAL PRESSURE). THE ABSORBENT WILL BE PUMPED TO ANOTHER CONTACTOR THAT IS KEPT AT A STATE THAT WILL FAVOR DESORPTION OF THE NITROGEN (LOWER NITROGEN PARTIAL PRESSURE). THE PURIFIED NATURAL GAS WILL REMAIN AT WELLHEAD PRESSURE AND CAN BE ADDED TO THE PIPELINEWITHOUT FURTHER COMPRESSIONS. DURING THIS PHASE I PROOF-OF-CONCEPT PROGRAM WE WILL ATTEMPTTO DEMONSTRATE 1) REVERSIBLE N2 COMPLEXATION BY THE ABSORBENT UNDER THESE \"PRESSURE SWING\" CONDITIONS, 2) RATES OF N2 BINDING AND DISSOCIATION SUFFICIENT TO LEAD TO AN ECONOMICAL PROCESS, AND 3) SUFFICIENT N2/CH4 SELECTIVITY TO INDICATE THAT CH4 LOSSES IN THE ULTIMATE PROCESS WILL BE AT LOW, ACCEPTABLE LEVELS.

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A NOVEL, COST-EFFECTIVE CARRIER VEHICLE FOR BOVINE INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR (IGF): THE BOVINE IGF CARRIER PROTEIN (BBP3).BBP3 WILL BIND IGF WITH HIGH AFFINITY, PROTECT IT FROM DEGRADATION, AND SLOWLY RELEASE IT IN AN ACTIVE FORM. THEREFORE, BBP3 WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE BIOACTIVITY OF IGF, PARTICULARLY IN GROWTH PROMOTION, MILK PRODUCTION AND WOUND HEALING. INCORPORATION OF IGF COMPLEXED WITH ITSCARRIER PROTEIN BBP3 INTO TRADITIONAL CONTROLLED RELEASE DELIVERY SYSTEMS WILL ALSO GREATLY IMPROVE IGF'S BIOACTIVITY, SINCE IGF WILL CONTINUE TO BE PROTECTED FROM RAPID DEGRADATION UPON RELEASE FROM THE CONTROLLED RELEASE DEVICE. IN ADDITION, BBP3 IS NATURAL, SAFE, AND BIODEGRADABLE. THE AIMS OF THE PHASE I PROJECT ARE TO ISOLATE THE GENE ENCODING BBP3 USING HUMAN BP3CDNA FRAGMENTSAS PROBES, EXPRESS BBP3 IN E. COLI, PURIFY RECOMBINANT-DERIVED BBP3, AND DEMONSTRATE ITS ABILITY TO PROTECT IGF FROM DEGRADATION AND ELIMINATION IN VIVO. DURING PHASE II, THE ABILITY OF BBP3 TO POTENTIATE IGF'S GROWTH AND WOUND HEALING ACTIONS WILL BE DEMONSTRATED. THISTECHNOLOGY CAN BE EXTENDED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF IGF CARRIERPROTEINS FOR OTHER DOMESTIC ANIMALS. THE WORLDWIDE MARKET FOR ENHANCERS OF ANIMAL GROWTH AND MILKPRODUCTION IN THE BEEF AND DAIRY INDUSTRIES IS ESTIMATED AT OVER A BILLION DOLLARS. THUS THE INTRODUCTION OF A NOVEL, LONG-ACTING, SAFE, COST-EFFECTIVE, NATURAL, AND BIODEGRADABLE GROWTH ENHANCER WILL HAVE VAST COMMERCIAL VALUE. COMPLETION OF THIS PROPOSED PROJECT WILL RESULT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BOVINE IGF CARRIER PROTEIN WHICH WILLSIGNIFICANTLY POTENTIATE THE ACTIONS OF IGF ON ANIMAL GROWTHPROMOTION, ENHANCED MILK PRODUCTION, AND ACCELERATED WOUND HEALING.",

A DR TECHNIQUE KNOWN AS SLIT RADIOGRAPHY, USING THESE DETECTORS, MAY HAVE SPECIAL APPLICATION FOR BOND LINE DEFECTS IN CYLINDRICAL ASSEMBLIES. SLIT RADIOGRAPHY CAN QUICKLY MAP DENSITY VARIATIONS WITHIN THE ROCKET MOTOR WALL ASSOCIATED WITH MATRIX RICH AREAS, CRACKS, POROSITY, AND VOIDS. THIS CAN REPLACE THE USE OF TRADITIONAL FILM TANGENTIAL RADIOGRAPHY FOR BOND LINE INSPECTION. THE DETECTORS HAVE A WIDE DYNAMIC RANGE TO ACCOMMODATE THE MULTIPLE-PATH DATA COLLECTION NECESSARY FOR CT. THIS FEATURE ALLOWS THE DETECTORS TO PICK UP VERY SMALL DENSITY DIFFERENCES IN MATERIALS WHEN USED FOR EITHER DR OR CT. RECENT SPATIAL RESOLUTION IMPROVEMENTS ALSO MAKE IT POSSIBLETO RESOLVE THE SMALL FEATURES OF INTEREST IN INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS. THIS PROJECT WILL DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF USING SLIT RADIOGRAPHY WITH HIGH-PERFORMANCE DISCRETE ELEMENT DETECTORSTO EVALUATE BOND LINE DEFECTS. WE WILL COLLECT AND STUDY SAMPLES OF BOND LINE DEFECTS SIMULATED IN PHANTOMS AND ACTUAL SAMPLES FROM BOND LINE ASSEMBLIES.

IMMOBILIZATION TECHNOLOGY WILL BE USED TO COVALENTLY IMMOBILIZE HIRUDIN ONTO SILICONE RUBBER AND POLYURETHANE. THEN THE HIRUDIN-COATED POLYMERS WILL BE ASSAYED FOR THROMBIN-BINDING ACTIVITY, PROTEOLYTIC ACTIVITY OF BOUND THROMBIN, AND PLATELET ADHESION. PHASE II STUDIES WILL COMPARE HEPARIN TO HIRUDIN AS ANTITHROMBIC SURFACE TREATMENTS AND WILL EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF THESE TREATMENTS IN EX VIVO SHUNT AND IN VIVO BLOOD COMPATIBILITY ASSAYS. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS PROJECT IS EXPECTED TO PRODUCE SUPERIOR ANTITHROMBIC SURFACETREATMENTS FOR DEVICES THAT ARE PLACED IN CONTACT WITH BLOOD.",

WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THREE ENSYMES/SUBSTRATES THAT HAVE MINIMAL OVERLAP AT THREE SEPARATE WAVELENGTHS CORRESPONDING TO THEIR RESPECTIVE MAXIMUM ABSORBANCE. DURING PHASE I, WE WILL DEFINITIVELY IDENTIFY THE THREE ENZYMES AND MULTIPLE SUBSTRATE SOLUTIONS THAT WILL WORK SIMULTANEOUSLY, CONJUGATE EACH ENZYME TO A SEPARATE ANTIBODY, DEVELOP INDIVIDUAL ELISA'S FOR EACH ANALYTE, AND TEST THE THREE ANALYTE SYSTEMS CONCURRENTLY. THE ELISA'S WILL BE DEVELOPED USING A FUNGUS (CANDIDA ALBICANS), A VIRUS (HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS, TYPE 1), AND A BACTERIA (PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA).

THE PHASE I EFFORT STARTS WITH THE PREMISE THAT BORON ANALOGUES OF AROMATIC AMINO ACIDS AND PEPTIDES CONTAINING ONE OR MORE BORONATED AROMATIC AMINO ACID ANALOGUES MAY SHOWCONCENTRATION AND RETENTION IN TUMOR CELLS AND BE SUITABLE FOR BNCT. A SIGNIFICANT RELATIVE BIOLOGICAL EFFECT (WASHED CELLS) WAS INDICATED IN A PRELIMINARY (NEUTRON CAPTURE) BIOLOGICAL EFFICACY STUDY IN CELL CULTURE USING A (GLYCINE) BORON AMINO ACID - AROMATIC AMINO ACID DIPEPTIDE. THE PHASE I EFFORT SHOULD RESULT IN A NUMBER OF NEW BORON ANALOGUES OF AROMATIC AMINO ACIDS AND SELECT PEPTIDE DERIVATIVES.

A PRINCIPAL CAUSE OF TEMPERATURE NON-UNIFORMITY IS THE LACK OF PENETRATION AND MIXING OF DILUTION AIR IN THE COMBUSTOR DILUTION ZONE. AN ADVANCED DILUTION HOLE CONCEPT IS PROPOSED THAT IMPROVES JET PENETRATION AND MIXING COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL HOLE DESIGNS. THE CONCEPT EMPLOYS CO-AXIAL JETS; THE OUTER JET IS SWIRLED WHILE THE INNER JET IS NOT. A RADIAL PRESSURE DROP, CAUSED BY OUTER SWIRL, RESULTS IN A PRESSURE DROP ACROSS THE INNER JET MUCH HIGHER THAN THE COMBUSTOR LINER PRESSURE DROP. THE INCREASED PRESSURE DROP IS EXPECTED TO GREATLY ENHANCE PENETRATION AND MIXING OF THE INNER DILUTION JET. PHASE I WILL USE COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS TECHNIQUES TO ANALYZE AND COMPARE CONVENTIONAL AND ADVANCED HOLE DESIGNS. THE TECHNICAL MERIT AND FEASIBILITY OF THE CONCEPT WILL BE VERIFIED OR DISPROVED. IF VERIFIED, PHASE II WILL OPTIMIZE THE CONCEPT AND DEVELOP A DESIGN SYSTEM FOR ITS IMPLEMENTATION. OPTIMUM CONFIGURATIONS WILL BE FABRICATED AND EXPERIMENTALLY TESTED.",

PYROLYTIC CARBON IS AN EXCELLENT RF ENERGY ABSORBER AND ALSO A GOOD REDUCING AGENT. THEREFORE, CONVERSION OF SO2 AND NOX TO SULFUR, NITROGEN, AND CARBON DIOXIDE CAN READILY BE ACCOMPLISHED BY PYROLYTIC CARBON COMBINED WITH RF ENERGY. THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA OBTAINED TO DATE STRONGLY INDICATE THE POSSIBILITY OF DEVELOPING AN ADVANCED PROCESS FOR SIMULTANEOUS REMOVAL OF SO2 AND NOX FROM FLUE GAS.

MANUALLY OPERATED CUFFS REQUIRE AN INITIAL INFLATION AND INTERMITTENT REINFLATION AS THE SOLUTION IS DISPENSED. SELF-INFLATING CONSTANT PRESSURE CUFFS ARE BULKY AND EXPENSIVE ($500). FOR ALL CUFFS, EVEN IF THE GAS PRESSURE IS MAINTAINED AT 300 MMHG, THE PRESSURE OF THE SOLUTION DECREASES CONSIDERABLY AS ITS VOLUME IS DISPENSED. BECAUSE BLOOD AND BLOOD PRODUCTS ARE ADMINISTERED TO PATIENTS THROUGH A BREAK IN THE PROTECTIVE BARRIER OF THE SKIN, THERE IS THE POTENTIAL OF EXPOSING THE PATIENT TO CROSS-CONTAMINATION. EXCEPT FOR THE CUFF, ALL COMPONENTS USED TO ADMINISTER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS ARE DISPOSABLE. WASHING AND/OR STERILIZING THE CUFF, IF POSSIBLE, IS TIME CONSUMING, COSTLY, AND LEADS TO COMPONENT FAILURES. THE ONLY DISPOSABLE CUFF IS MANUAL AND COSTS $12. THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO DEVELOP A LOW-COST, COMPACT, DISPOSABLE, SELF-INFLATING, PRESSURE-MAINTAINING CUFF FOR HOSPITALS AND FIELD USE. THE CUFF, IN COMBINATION WITH AN ADJUSTABLE FLOW RESISTOR, CAN BE USED TO CONTROL FLOW. THE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED CAN BE APPLIED WHEREVER A COMPACT, SELF-CONTAINED, REGULATED PRESSURE SOURCE IS REQUIRED.",

ANALYTIC PROOFS SHOW THAT EXISTING ADVANCED CONTROL STRATEGIES SHOULD BE CAPABLE OF DEXTROUS FORCE CONTROL. HOWEVER, TWO MORE PRACTICAL LIMITATIONS HAVE PREVENTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRECISE FORCE CONTROLLED ROBOTS: A MECHANISM ABLE TO EXECUTE THE FORCE COMMANDS, AND A CONTROL SYSTEM WHICH CAN SATISFY THE COMPUTATIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF ADVANCED FORCE CONTROL ALGORITHMS. DYNAMIC MICROSYSTEMS HAS DEVELOPED A NEW ROBOT CONTROLLER - THE 3DP - WHICH OFFERS UNMATCHED COMPUTATIONAL POWER FOR ADVANCED ROBOT CONTROL. BY COUPLING THIS CONTROLLER WITH A CAREFULLY DESIGNED LOW-INERTIA REDUNDANT MECHANISM, WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A PRECISE FORCE CONTROLLABLE ROBOTIC SYSTEM. FOR THIS PHASE I EFFORT WE WILL DEMONSTRATE THROUGH COMPUTER SIMULATION AND ANALYSIS THAT THE ROBOTIC SYSTEM DESCRIBED IN THIS PROPOSAL CAN PRODUCE PRECISE FORCE CONTROLLED MANIPULATIONS.",

APPROXIMATELY 95 PERCENT OF THESE PATIENTS HAVE BEEN TRACED AND THEIR VITAL STATUS DETERMINED, WITH 483 OF THE 575 DEATHS CODED FOR CAUSE OF DEATH. INITIAL ANALYSES SUGGEST THAT INDIVIDUALS IN THE BOTTOM 20 PERCENT IN PHYSICAL FITNESS AT THEIR INITIAL CLINIC VISIT HAVE OVER 1.5 TIMES THE RISK OF DEATH FROM ANY CAUSE WHEN COMPARED TO THE MOST FIT PATIENTS. THIS INCREASED RISK WAS OBSERVED EVEN AFTER CONTROLLING FOR THE EFFECTS OF OTHER IMPORTANT RISK FACTORS,INCLUDING CHOLESTEROL, AGE, BMI, RESTING BLOOD PRESSURE, EXERCISE HABITS, AND SMOKING HABITS.

FLUIDIC VORTEX AMPLIFIERS, EJECTOR PUMPS AND OTHER TYPE OF COMPONENTS OFFERTHE HIGHEST DEGREE OF RELIABILITY IN THESE VENTILATION SYSTEM APPLICATIONS BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO-MOVING-PARTS TO WEAR OUT, RELATIVELY FAST RESPONSE, REQUIRE LITTLE OR NO MAINTENANCE AND SOME CASES ARE CHEAPER THAN EQUIVALENT CONVENTIONAL SYSTEMS. HOWEVER THE FLUID COMPONENTS USED IN THESE SYSTEMS REPRESENT TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE IN THE 70'S AND DO NOT REPRESENT RECENT ADVANCES IN SECOND GENERATION FLUIDIC COMPONENT DESIGNS. THIS PROJECT WILL EVALUATE SECOND GENERATION FLUIDIC COMPONENTS FOR USE IN VENTILATION SYSTEMS. SPECIFIC EMPHASIS WILL BE PLACED ON UP GRADING THE STABILITY, PERFORMANCE, AND LOAD SENSITIVITY OF HIGH PERFORMANCE VORTEXAMPLIFIER COMPONENTS. RECENT ADVANCEMENTS RESULTING FROM ONGOING WORK ON HIGH EFFICIENCY, MINIATURE DIVERTER AND A ATTITUDE CONTROL VORTEX THRUSTER VALVES FOR THE SDI/INNOVATIVE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OFFICE WILL BE EXPLOITED. MODULAR DESIGNS WILL BE PURSUED WHICH WILL DECOUPLE HIGH GAIN VORTEX AMPLIFIERS FROM THEIR ENVIRONMENT. TESTS WILL BE CONDUCTED TO DEMONSTRATE THE PERFORMANCE OF A VENTILATION SIZE FLOW MODEL.

UNFORTUNATELY, ALONG WITH THE ADVANTAGES OF A TOWED ARRAY COME INHERENT PROBLEMS. THE MAIN PROBLEM IS THAT THE ARRAY CONFIGURATION CHANGES WITH TIME, DUE TO VARIOUS FACTORS SUCH AS TURBULENCE AND THE TOW-SHIP-S INABILITY TO STEER IN A PERFECTLY STRAIGHT LINE, MAKING ACCURATE BEAMFORMING DIFFICULT. ALSO, SINCE THE TOWED ARRAY ACQUIRES OTHER THAN A STRAIGHT LINE MOTION, BEAM POINTING DIRECTIONS ARE UNSTABLE GIVING THE APPEARANCETHAT TARGETS ARE WANDERING. PRECISE BEAMFORMING AND BEARING ESTIMATION ON AN ARRAY DEPEND ON KNOWING THE RELATIVE LOCATION OF THE SENSORS TO A SMALL FRACTION OF A WAVELENGTH OF THE HIGHEST ACOUSTIC FREQUENCY PROCESSED ON THE ARRAY. THE ACOUSTIC SENSOR LOCATION ERRORS MUST BE PARTICULARLY SMALL IF THE BENEFITS OF THE LARGER APERTURE AVAILABLE ON A TOWED ARRAY ARE TO BE REALIZED.

        "abstract": "Abstract         SIGN LANGUAGE IS THE NORMAL MODE OF COMMUNICATION FOR MANY DEAF AND NON-SPEAKING INDIVIDUALS. THE PROBLEM WITH SIGN LANGUAGE IS THAT TO COMMUNICATE, ALL PERSONS INVOLVED MUST UNDERSTAND SIGN LANGUAGE AND BE IN PLAIN SIGHT OF EACH OTHER. A SYSTEM IS NEEDED THAT CAN ENCODE SIGN LANGUAGE AND CONVERT IT TO THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE TEXT THAT IT REPRESENTS, SO THAT REMOTE SIGNERS AND THOSE NOT VERSED IN SIGN LANGUAGE CAN COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER. DIGITAL VIDEO PROCESSING, INC. PROPOSES TO DEVELOP A SIGN LANGUAGE RECOGNITION AND TRANSLATION SYSTEM TO ALLOW USERS VERSED IN SIGN LANGUAGE TO MORE READILY COMMUNICATE. THE SYSTEM WILL HARNESS REAL-TIME MOTIONS AND POSITIONS AND ENCODE THIS INFORMATION. A SIGN LANGUAGE RECOGNIZER WILL INTERPRET THE DATA AND RELATE IT TO A DICTIONARY OF SEGMENTS(LETTERS, WORDS, ETC.) AND CHOOSE THE APPROPRIATE SEGMENT. THE PHASE I EFFORT WILL ADDRESS THE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITIES ASSOCIATED WITH ENCODING THE INPUTS, EXTRACTING THE INPUT'S INFORMATION CONTENT, AND RECOGNIZING AND TRANSLATING PARTICULAR SEGMENTS. A COMPLETE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE SPECIFICATION FOR THE PROTOTYPE SYSTEM WILL BE DETAILED. ALSO, PROPOSED ALGORITHMS FOR REAL-TIME SIGN LANGUAGE RECOGNITION WILL BE DESCRIBED, AND THE ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE SIGN LANGUAGE GIVEN THE SOCIAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND GEOGRAPHIC DIFFERENCES INHERENT IN ANY FORM OF COMMUNICATION WILL BE ASCERTAINED.",

THIS MODEL EMPHASIZES BEYOND VISUAL RANGE (BVR) COMBAT. THE WITHIN-VISUAL-RANGE (WVR) OR CLOSE-IN COMBAT PORTION OF AASPEM IS A CARRY OVER FROM AN EARLIER MODEL, PACAM V. RESULTS OF STUDIES CONDUCTED BY EIDETICS INTERNATIONAL FOR ASD/XRM INDICTE THAT AASPEM DOES NOT MODEL MODERN CLOSE-IN COMBAT WELL. THE AASPEM CLOSE-IN COMBAT TACTICS LOGIC (WHICH CONTROLS THE AIRCRAFT ENGAGED IN COMBAT) RELIES ON TACTICS DEVELOPED FOR HIGH WING LOADED, MEDIUM THRUST-TO-WEIGHT AIRCRAFT. DURING AN ENGAGEMENT THE AASPEM AIRCRAFT MOVE QUICKLY TO THEIR \"CORNER VELOCITY\" TO MAXIMIZE THEIR TURN RATE EVEN THROTTLING BACK IF FASTER THAN THEIR \"CORNER SPEED.\" THE RESULTING \"DOGFLIGHTS\" ARE DOMINATED BY SUSTAINED TURNING PERFORMANCE AT NEARLY CONSTANT ALTITUDE. MODERN FIGHTER AIRCRAFT WITH HIGH THRUST OT WEIGHT RATIOS AND LOW WIND LOADING SUCH AS THE F-14, F-15, F-16 AND F-18 RARELY BECOME ENGAGED IN SUSTAINED TURN FIGHTS. VERTICAL MANEUVERS AND SHORT, HARD TURNS WITH THE SPEED DROPPING BELOW \"CORNER SPEED\" AS REQUIRED, FOLLOWED BY RE-ACCELERATIONS, MORE CORRECTLY CHARACTERIZED MODERN FIGHTER COMBAT. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS SBIR EFFORT, BOTH PHASE I AND PHASE II, IS TO UPGRADE THE TACTICS LOGIC OF AASPEM TO BETTER REPRESENT CLOSE-IN COMBAT OF MODERN FIGHTERS. THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE OF THIS PHASE I EFFORT IS TO GATHER FRIENDLY AND ADVERSARY, SINGLE AND MULTIPLE SHIP TACTICS INFORMATION TO BE INCORPORATED IN THE AASPEM TACTICS LOGIC DURING A PHASE II EFFORT. THIS TACTICS INFORMATION WILL BE GATHERED FROM A REVIEW OF CURRENT TACTICS MANUALS AND DURING INTERVIEWS AT THE AIR FORCE AND NAVAL FIGHTER WEAPONS SCHOOLS AND FROM SIMULATED AIR-TO-AIR COMBAT RECORDED ON THE AIR COMBAT MANEUVERING INSTRUMENTATION (ACMI) AND TACTICAL AIR COMBAT TRAINING SYSTEM (TACTS) RANGES.",

HELICOPTER ROTORS, ENGINE INLETS, AS WELL AS MANY RECENTLY DESIGNED AIRCRAFT, ARE COMMONLY COMPOSITE. IN THE PROPOSED DESIGN A THIN SPIRAL COIL IS ENCAPSULATED IN ELASTOMER AND BONDED TO THE COMPOSITE LEAD EDGE. A THIN METAL STRIP IS FORMED ACROSS THE LEAD EDGE OVER THE COIL. A BANK OF CAPACITORS DISCHARGES THROUGH THE COIL, INDUCING EDDY CURRENTS IN THE THIN METAL STRIP AND CREATING THE IMPULSE DEICING FORCE. THE OUTER STRIP SERVES AS A SURFACE FOR THE COLLECTION AND SHEDDING OF ICE AND DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES. SOME OF THE ADVANTAGES OF THE PROPOSED EDDY CURRENT REPULSION DEICING STRIP (EDS) OVER OTHER ELECTRICAL IMPULSE DEICING SYSTEMS FOLLOW: 1. NO STRESS OR FATIGUE OF THE AIRCRAFT STRUCTURE, ONLY TO THE REPLACEABLE, OUTER METAL STRIP. 2. EASY TO RETROFIT, THERE IS NO IMPACT ON AIRCRAFT DESIGN OR STRUCTURE. 3. PROVIDES A TOUGH, EROSION RESISTANT METAL LEAD EDGE. 4. MINIMUM EMI DUE TO THE SHIELDING EFFECT OF THE METAL. 5. ICE DOES NOT ADHERE TO METAL AS WELL AS TO ELASTOMER.",

THE DETECTION PRINCIPLE IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT INCIDENT INFRARED RADIATION PRODUCES A VOLTAGE SHIFT ACROSS THE JOSEPHSON JUNCTION, WHICH CAN SERVE AS A USEFUL DETECTOR OUTPUT. THUS IN THE PRESENT WORK, SUPERCONDUCTING WEAK LINKTYPE JOSEPHSON JUNCTION WILL BE FABRICATED AND TESTED AS A USEFUL DETECTOR. BULK SUPERCONDUCTOR SAMPLES OF BI-CA-SR-CU-O WILL BE PREPARED BY SOLID STATE REACTION METHOD. SUBSEQUENTLY, SUPERCONDUCTING THIN FILM OF 3-5 MICRON THICKNESS, WILL BE DEPOSITED ON A SUITABLE SUBSTRATE (MGO) BY LASER INDUCED DEPOSITION TECHNIQUE. A MAJOR ADVANTAGE OF THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUE IS THAT DUE TO EXCELLENTSPATIAL QUALITY AND SHORT WAVELENGTH (0.248 MICRON) OF THE LASER, IT PROVIDES A PRECISE CONTROL OVER THE DEPOSITION PROCESS WITH SUBMICRON RESOLUTION. TO FORM A WEAK LINK, A PART OF THE SUBSTRATE SURFACE IS GROUND DOWN (OR ETCHED BY LASER) TO FORM A GROOVE OF ABOUT 5 MICRON DEEPPRIOR TO THE DEPOSITION. FOR DETECTION, INFRARED SIGNALS WILL BE MODULATED AND GUIDED THROUGH AN OPTICAL FIBER TO THE DETECTOR. IN PHASE I, DETECTOR PERFORMANCE IN TERMS OF RESPONSIVITY AND MINIMUM DETECTABLE POWER LEVEL (NEP) IN THE SPECTRAL REGION OF 1-10 MICRON WILL BE EVALUATED. THE RESPONSIVITY OF THE PROPOSED DETECTOR IS ESTIMATED TO BE 10(4)V/W, WHICH IS SEVERAL ORDERS (4-5) OF MAGNITUDE HIGHER THAN THE PRESENTLY AVAILABLE QUANTUM DETECTOR IN THE 3-12 MICRON SPECTRAL REGION.",

TO DATE, MOST OF THE PROJECTS TO DEVELOP SUCH SYSTEMS HAVE HAD REDUCED SUCCESS DUE TO A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS THAT ARE INHERENT IN THE HYPERMEDIA TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM. WE PRESENT AN ANALYSIS OF KNOWN WEAKNESES IN SUCH SYSTEMS, AND A FRAMEWORK FOR DEVELOPMENT OF AN OBJECT-ORIENTED STRUCTURED HYPERMEDIA SYSTEM THAT WILL RESOLVE THESE WEAKNESSES AND FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT SYSTEM TO VALIDATE THE EFFICACY OF THIS TECHNOLOGY. THE TEAM ASSEMBLED FOR THIS TASK HAS PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF OBJECTORIENTED SYSTEMS, AND IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF DEDUCTIVE AND INDUCTIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDING HYPERMEDIA SYSTEMS ACROSS A RANGE OF FIELD ENVIRONMENTS.",

INAPPROPRIATE DETOXIFICATION PROTOCOLS CAN BE AT BEST INEFFECTIVE AND AT WORST LETHAL. THE KNOWLEDGE REQUIRED FOR PREPARING APPROPRIATE DETOXIFICATION PROTOCOLS IS HIGHLY SPECIALIZED, BUT FOR MANY PHYSICIANS, THIS KNOWLEDGE IS NOT READILY AVAILABLE. DETOX WILL PROVIDE A MEANS OF ALLOWING PHYSICIANS TO EASILY TAP THIS KNOWLEDGE. THE EXPECTED BENEFITS ARE: (1) SAFER AND MORE ACCURATE DETOXIFICATION PROCEDURES, (2) MORE RELIABLE TREATMENT, (3) MORE RAPID DELIVERY OF TREATMENT, AND (4) LOWER TREATMENT COSTS. DETOX WILL INCLUDE ALL SEDATIVE-HYPNOTICS, OPIATES, AND STIMULANTS IN THE PHYSICIAN'S DESK REFERENCE; THE ALCOHOL CONTENT OF COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE BEERS, WINES, AND LIQUORS; WITHDRAWAL PROTOCOLS AND KEY REFERENCES TO PUBLISHED DETOXIFICATION PROTOCOLS; AND STREET DRUG NOMENCLATURE. THE EXPERT SYSTEM WILL EMULATE A PHYSICIAN EXPERT IN WRITING DETOXIFICATION ORDERS. THE SYSTEM USER, IN RESPONSETO COMPUTER PROMPTS, WILL ENTER THE PATIENT'S DRUG HISTORY AND OTHER MEDICAL INFORMATION NEEDED BY THE EXPERT SYSTEM TOCOMPUTE THE WITHDRAWAL SCHEDULE. OUTPUT OF THE SYSTEM IS A DETOXIFICATION PROTOCOL, A SUMMARYOF MEDICAL FACTS CONSIDERED IN COMPUTING THE SCHEDULE, AND THE FORMS NEEDED TO CLINICALLY MONITOR THE PATIENT DURING WITHDRAWAL.

WE PROPOSE TO BLEND NOVEL LIQUID CRYSTAL POLYMERS (LCPS) WITH NASA'S HIGH PERFORMANCE THERMOPLASTIC POLYIMIDE, LARC-TPI TO OBTAIN MATERIAL PROPERTIES THAT MEET NASA'S FUTURE MISSION REQUIREMENTS FOR SPACECRAFT. RECENT WORK SHOWS THAT SUCH BLENDS CAN REDUCE CTE BY MORE THAN A FACTOR OF 10 AND CAN INCREASE MODULUS BY MORE THAN THREE TIMES AT VOLUME RATIOS OF 30 TO 50 PERCENT FOR THE LCP. ALSO, THE BLEND IS MUCH EASIER TO PROCESS BECAUSE VISCOSITY IS REDUCED BY TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE. SUCH IMPROVEMENTS WILL MAKE LARC-TPI/LCP BLENDS FULLY COMPETITIVE WITH FIBER-REINFORCED COMPOSITES, BUT AT LOWER COST. THESE HIGH TEMPERATURE, HIGH STIFFNESS, LOW DENSITY, NEAR-ZERO CTE FILMS AND MOLDED PARTS WILL MAKE IDEAL MATERIALS FOR A VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS HIGH STRENGTH, HIGH STIFFNESS THIN-WALLED SPACE STRUCTURES, PRECISION SEGMENTED REFLECTORS FOR SOLAR COLLECTORS, AND ENGINE PARTS. THE BLENDS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE AS STRONG, STIFF AND DIMENSIONALLY STABLE AS FIBER-REINFORCED COMPOSITES, BUT WITHOUT THE DRAWBACKS OF DISTINCT FIBER AND MATRIX PHASES (MICROCRACKING, POOR TRANSVERSE STRENGTH, ETC.). ALSO, SINCE THE BLENDS CAN BE DIRECTLY FABRICATED INTO PARTS SUCH AS TUBES AND STRUCTURAL SHEET, THEY WILL BE CHEAPER TO FABRICATE THAN MULTI-STEP FIBER COMPOSITES (PREPREG, WEAVING, LAY-UP, CURING, CUTTING, BONDING.

HYPOCHLORITES HAVE BEEN WIDELY USED BY HEALTH CARE FACILITIES FOR THE CLEANING OF REUSED DIALYZERS PRIOR TO STERILIZATION WITH FORMALDEHYDE. AN ELECTROCHEMICAL GENERATOR SYSTEM THAT PRODUCES SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE FROM SALT (NAC1) SOLUTION ON DEMAND AT SET CONCENTRATIONS WOULD INCREASE SAFETY, REPRODUCIBILITY AND RELIABILITY OF THE REUSED DIALYZER CLEANING PROCESS. THE QUANTITY OF HYPOCHLORITE GENERATED WOULD BE ACCURATELY CONTROLLED BY THESET ELECTRIC CURRENT OF THE GENERATOR. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THIS PHASE I PROPOSAL ARE TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OFDEVELOPING A FLOW-THROUGH AIR-DEPOLARIZED ELECTROCHEMICAL GENERATOR SYSTEM TO 1) REPRODUCIBLY AND RELIABLY SUPPLY HYPOCHLORITE ON DEMAND AT SET CONCENTRATIONS AND 2) VIABLY CLEAN AND REMOVE RESIDUAL BLOOD COMPONENTS FROM USED DIALYZERS. THE METHODOLOGY FOR ACHIEVING THESE GOALS IS TO 1) FABRICATEAN AIR (O2) DEPOLARIZED SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE GENERATOR AND CONDUCT PARAMETRIC TESTING TO DEFINE EFFICIENCY, OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS/LIMITATIONS AND INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS TO OTHER SUBSYSTEMS INCLUDING ELECTRIC AND SOLUTION CONTROL COMPONENTS AND 2) EVALUATE THE GENERATOR FOR REMOVING RESIDUAL BLOOD COMPONENTS FROM A USED DIALYZER AND RESTORING THE DIALYZER'S ORIGINAL SOLUTE CLEARANCE VALUE.

PORE-FREE, ADHERENT FILMS OF LESS THAN 1-MICRON THICKNESS HAVE ALREADY BEEN DEPOSITED ON TUNGSTEN SUBSTRATES. WE PROPOSE TO EVALUATE THESE FILMS AS AN ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTIVE, CORROSION-RESISTANT COATING FOR BIPOLAR SEPARATOR PLATES (CARBON-CARBON COMPOSITES) IN PHOSPHORIC ACID FUEL CELLS (PAFC).

THIN DIAMOND FILMS DEPOSITED ON THE BIPOLAR PLATES, IN ADDITION TO BEING CORROSION RESISTANT, CAN ALSO ACT AS A BARRIER LAYER, THUS PREVENTING ACID ABSORPTION.

IN SITU IS THE METHOD OF CHOICE BECAUSE MODEST CHANGES IN PER CELL CONTENT OF SEVERAL KEY GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTORS CAN LEAD TO SELECTION AND EVENTUAL DOMINATION OF LINEAGES WITH CLINICAL RELEVANCE FOR DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF BREAST CANCER. THE RELATIVELY SMALL CHANGE IN PER CELL CONTENT CAN BE OBSCURED BY SUBSTANTIAL INTRA- AND INTERTUMOR HETEROGENEITY WHEN AVERAGING ASSAYS ARE USED. ONLY RADIOACTIVE METHODS GIVE THE REQUIRED SENSITIVITY FOR THESE LOW-ABUNDANCE MRNAS,AND THESE METHODS ARE INFERIOR TO BIOTIN- AND AVIDIN-BASED METHODS. LACK OF A SENSITIVE AND RAPID BIOTIN-BASED METHOD HAS HAMPERED TRANSITION OF RECEPTOR RESEARCH TO ROUTINE CLINICAL PRACTICE. A METHOD IS PROPOSED THAT TRANSFERS MRNA DIRECTLY FROM TISSUE CELLS IN FROZEN SECTION TO IMMOBILIZING CELLULOSE MEMBRANES.

        "abstract": "Abstract         OPERATION OF A JAMMER TRANSMITTER FROM A SMALL PLATFORM (RPV OR JEEP) NECESSITATES THE USE OF ELECTRICALLY SHORT ANTENNAS SUCH AS SHORT WHIPS AND SMALL LOOPS. THE CONVENTIONAL APPROACH USES A POWER AMPLIFIER DESIGNED FOR A 50-OHM LOAD AND AN ANTENNA TUNER THAT MATCHES THE ANTENNA-INPUT IMPEDANCE TO OHMS. HOWEVER, THE RAPID FREQUENCY CHANGES REQUIRED BY JAMMERS PRECLUDE THE USE OF ANTENNA TUNING. THE PROPOSED PROGRAM IS A FEASIBILITY STUDY AND SYSTEM DESIGN FOR A NOVEL APPROACH THAT INTEGRATES THE POWER AMPLIFIER (PA), ANTENNA, AND MATCHING NETWORK. THE ANTENNA ITSELF IS OPTIMIZED TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE (GIVEN SIZE CONSTRAINTS) FOR MINIMUM VSWR. THE FILTER/MATCHING NETWORK ATTENUATES HARMONICS FROM THE PA AND BRINGS THE VSWR TO A REASONABLE LEVEL (E.G., <2:1) WITHIN ITS FREQUENCY BAND. A PIN-DIODE NETWORK SELECTS THE APPROPRIATE FILTER/MATCHING NETWORK FOR THE FREQUENCY OF OPERATION. AN OVERRATED PA DELIVERS THE SPECIFIED POWER INTO THE APPROXIMATELY MATCHED LOAD IMPEDANCE. THE FET PA ACHIEVES MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY BY OPERATING IN CLASS D AT HF AND SATURATED CLASS C AT VHF. A SWITCHING REGULATOR AND CONTROL UNIT MAINTAIN THE SPECIFIED OUTPUT POWER AND MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY IN SPITE OF VARIATIONS IN ITS LOAD IMPEDANCE.",

SUCH A DEVELOPMENT WOULD RESULT IN REDUCED FBC MAINTENANCE COSTS AND IMPROVED RELIABILITY AND OPERABILITY. THIS PROPOSAL OUTLINES A PROGRAM TO SYSTEMATICALLY EVALUATE THE EROSION/CORROSION RESISTANCE OF A NUMBER OF COMPOSITIONSAPPLIED BY THE HYPERSONIC FLAME SPRAY PROCESS, USING THE SIMULATED FBC EROSION TEST RIG AT THE LAWRENCE BERKELEY LABORATORY TO SCREEN THE APPLIED COATINGS. THE COATINGS FORTHE MOST PART WILL BE MECHANICALLY-BLENDED MIXTURES OF A HARD CARBIDE AND A SOFTER, CORROSION-RESISTANT MATRIX ALLOY.

IGC/ASI HAS BEEN DEVELOPING THE INTERNAL TIN PROCESS FOR THEMANUFACTURE OF NB3SN FOR MANY YEARS AND RECENTLY HAS IMPROVED THE DESIGN AND FABRICATION PROCEDURES TO INCREASE THE PIECE LENGTH AND FURTHER ENHANCE THE PROPERTIES. THE LOSSES IN PULSED APPLICATIONS HAVE NOW BEEN REDUCED TO THE POINT WHERE THOSE DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF SUPERCONDUCTOR ON THE INSIDE OF THE BARRIER ARE APPARENT AS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE OVERALL LOSSES. IT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE WORK PROPOSED HERE TO REDUCE THESE BARRIER LOSSES. THE STRAIGHT REPLACEMENT OF NB BY TA OR V, WHILE IT MAY SOLVE THE ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS, WILL INCREASE THE COST OF THE CONDUCTOR. IT MAY ALSO BE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE THE REPLACEMENT, PARTICULARLY WITH TA, USING THE CONVENTIONAL EXTRUSION AND HIP'ING METHODS OF MAKING THE STABILIZER. WE WILL, THEREFORE, EXPLORE THREE NEW WAYS TO INTRODUCE TA AND V BARRIERS IN AN ECONOMICAL MANNER, SO AS TO KEEP THE COST OF THE NB3SN PRODUCT TO A MINIMUM AND IMPROVE THE MATERIAL'S PULSED PERFORMANCE, WITHOUT SACRIFICING ON JC AND PIECE LENGTH. THREE APPROACHES WILL BE TRIED IN PHASE I. A. ROLLED UP AND OVERLAPPED TANTALUM FOIL INSIDE A COPPER STABILIZER TUBE. B. ROLLED UP AND OVERLAPPED TANTALUM FOIL INSIDE A COPPER TUBE, HIP'D AFTER ASSEMBLY. C. A NB FOIL WITH V STRIPS ATTACHED, ROLLED UP AND OVERLAPPED INSIDE A COPPER TUBE.

HOWEVER, A LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE ABILITY OF NB3SN TO PERFORM RELIABLY IN A RANGE OF DIFFERENT MAGNET DESIGNS EXISTS IN THE MINDS OF MANY MAGNET BUILDERS, MAKING IT VERY DIFFICULT TO COMMERCIALIZE THE PRODUCT. WHEN ANY MAGNET PERFORMS BADLY IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS DUE TO DEFECTIVE WIRE OR THAT THE MATERIAL HAS BEEN HANDLED POORLY BY THE MAGNET WINDER. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE OF A RELATIVELY BRITTLE MATERIAL SUCH AS REACTED NB3SN. THE AIM OF THIS PROPOSED WORK IS TO DEVELOP ACCEPTANCE FOR THE MATERIAL PRODUCED BY THE \"INTERNAL TIN\" PROCESS AS THE ECONOMICAL, RELIABLE, NB3SN MADE IN THE UNITED STATES, BY IMPROVING THE WIRE IN PHASE I AND MAKING COILS FROM THIS IMPROVED CONDUCTOR IN PHASE II. AT THE PRESENT TIME, SOME MAGNET WINDERS RELY ON AN OVERSEAS SUPPLIER WHOSE PRODUCT HAS A HIGHER COST AND LOWER PERFORMANCE CAPABILITY. THE SPECIFIC PURPOSE OF THIS PHASE I WORK IS TO EXAMINE THE UNIFORMITY OF THE TIN DISTRIBUTION IN THE MATERIAL AFTERHEAT TREATMENT, ALONG THE WIRE'S LENGTH AND ACROSS ANY CROSS SECTION. HOW THIS UNIFORMITY IS RELATED TO THE WIRE SIZE, THE CONDUCTOR DESIGN AND THE HEAT TREATMENT CONDITIONS WILL ALSO BE INVESTIGATED. THE OUTCOME OF THE PHASE I WORK WILL BE THE DETERMINATION OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SUCH A RECENTLY OBSERVED PHENOMENON AS THE LARGE VOID FORMATION IN THE TIN AREAS AFTER CERTAIN HEAT TREATMENT CYCLES. THESE VOIDS APPEAR TO BE LARGER THAN THOSE NORMALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE \"KIRKENDALL EFFECT\" WHICH HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED FOR SOME TIME. THEY APPEAR TO BE MORE IN THE NATURE OF MELTING CAVITIES. THIS PHASE I WORK WILL LEADTO IMPROVED CONDUCTOR DESIGNS, FABRICATING CONDITIONS AND HEAT TREATMENT PROCEDURES. IN THE PHASE II PART OF THE PROGRAM, THE ABOVE DEVELOPED DESIGNS WILL BE USED TO PRODUCE SEVERAL CONDUCTORS IN COMMERCIAL QUANTITIES AND WIND COILS TO DEMONSTRATE THE MATERIAL'S SUITABILITY FOR A RANGE OF DIFFERENT APPLICATIONSINCLUDING PERSISTENT MODE OPERATION. SOME OF THE CONDUCTOR DESIGNS ARE EXPECTED TO INVOLVE LARGER NUMBERS OF SUBELEMENTS WHICH WILL INTRODUCE GREATER BONDING PROBLEMS AND RESULT IN DECREASED PIECE LENGTHS. THE UNDERSTANDING OFTHESE BONDING PROBLEMS, PARTICULARLY AS THEY RELATE TO THE COMPOSITION AND HARDNESS OF THE SUBELEMENT ARRAYS WILL BE INVESTIGATED FURTHER IN PHASE II.",

THE PRINCIPAL REASON MOLYBDENUMMIRRORS HAVE NOT BEEN WIDELY USED IS BECAUSE SINGLE CRYSTALSOF ADEQUATE DIMENSIONS AND QUALITY HAVE NOT BEEN READILY AVAILABLE. A PROGRAM IS PROPOSED TO DEVELOP A PROCESS FOR PRODUCING HIGH QUALITY SINGLE CRYSTALS OF MOLYBDENUM OF LARGE DIMENSION AND A METHOD FOR MAKING VERY LOW SCATTER SUPERPOLISHED SURFACES FOR SUCH CRYSTALS.

THIS PROJECT WILL INVESTIGATE MORE EFFECTIVE METHODS OF DELIVERY OF THE PDGF/IGF-1 COMBINATION. DURING PHASE I, IN VITRO AND IN VIVO STUDIES OF FOUR DELIVERY METHODS ARE PLANNED: 3 PERCENT METHYLCELLULOSE GEL POLY (LACTIC ACID) POLYMER, BETA TRICALCIUM PHOSPHATE, AND DEMINERALIZED FREEZE-DRIED BONE ALLOGRAFT. IN VITRO STUDIES WILL INCLUDE INVESTIGATIONS OF THE KINETICS OF ADSORPTION AND RELEASE OF (125)I-PDGF AND (125)I-IGF-1 FROM THE FOUR DELIVERY MODALITIES. IN VIVO STUDIES WILL ALSO BE PERFORMED USING BEAGLE DOGS WITH NATURALLY OCCURRING PERIODONTAL DISEASE. AT THE TIME OF SURGERY, THE TREATMENT SITES WILL RECEIVE PDGF AND IGF-1 DELIVERED BY ONE OF THE FOUR METHODS. CONTROL SITES WILL RECEIVE THE DELIVERY VEHICLE ALONE. PRIOR TO AND AFTER SURGERY, THE UPTAKE OF A BONE-SEEKING RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL (99M-TECHNESIUM MDP) WILL BE MEASURED AND STANDARDIZED RADIOGRAPHS TAKEN. BLOCK BIOPSIES OF THE TEETH AND JAWS WILL BE EXAMINED HISTOLOGICALLY. ANALYSIS OF THESE DATA WILL REVEAL THE ABILITY OF PDGF/IGF-1 DELIVERED BY THE FOUR CARRIERS TO INDUCE PERIODONTAL REGENERATION.

SUBSCRIBER WIRELINE LOOPS ARE THE PRINCIPLE ACCESS METHOD TO THE MSE. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WIRELINE MUST BE INSTALLED EACH TIME A UNIT DISPLACES. MSE IS NOT VERY MOBILE IN TERMS OF THE BULK OF THE USERS, AND ITS CAPACITY IS SOMEWHAT LIMITED. ANY SOLUTION MUST CAPATIIZE ON THE MSE CAPABILITIES AND IMPROVE THEM. COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE DIGITAL CELLULAR TECHNOLOGY COULD BE ADAPTED TO ENHANCE MSES. THIS PROPOSAL IS TO STUDY THE PRESENT PROBLEM, ANALYZE THE ARCHITECTURE, RECOMMEND METHODS FOR INCORPORATING DIGITAL CELLULAR AND HIGHLIGHT THE RATIONALE FOR INTEGRATING NEW TECHNOLOGY.",

IMPROVED PERFORMANCE CAN BE REALIZED IF THE DENSITY PROFILE IS HIGHLY PEAKED IN THE CENTER. TO ACHIEVE SUCH PRECISE SHAPING OF THE DENSITY PROFILE, INJECTION VELOCITIES UP TO 10'S OF KM/SEC MAY BE REQUIRED FOR PELLETS OF A FEW MG IN MASS. PRESENT PELLET INJECTORS BASED ON ACCELERATION BY GAS PRESSURE OR MECHANICAL MEANS ARE CAPABLE OF ATTAINING VELOCITIES OF ONLY ABOUT 2 KM/SEC AND ARE NOT SCALABLE BECAUSE OF FUNDAMENTAL LIMITATIONS. THESE TECHNIQUES ALSO APPLY EXCESSIVE SHOCK TO THE PELLET WHICH CAN CAUSE IT TO FRACTURE. A CONCEPT TO CONTINUOUSLY ACCELERATE PELLETS SUPPORTED BY A SLUG OF HIGH TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTING MATERIAL IN AN ACCELERATOR TUBE BY PROPAGATING A MAGNETIC WAVE IN AN INDUCTOR THAT IS PART OF APULSE FORMING LINE IS PROPOSED. WITH PRESENTLY AVAILABLE HTS MATERIAL, ACCELERATION IN THE 10(4) TO 10(5) G RANGE IS ATTAINABLE. THE G-FORCE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE FRACTURE STRENGTH OF SOLID HYDROGEN. BECAUSE THE ACCELERATION IS CONTINUOUS RATHER THAN AS AN IMPULSE, THE NECESSARY INJECTION VELOCITY CAN BE ATTAINED IN DISTANCES OF ABOUT 10 METERS.

UNIFORM HIGH RATE DEPOSITION OF HIGH QUALITY, PINHOLE-FREE INTRINSIC LAYERS OVER LARGE AREAS IS ONE OF THOSE PROBLEMS. R&D; ON IMPROVED REACTION CHAMBERS IS NEEDED FOR CONTROLLED FABRICATION OF LARGE AREA A-SI LAYERS. FOR THE STANDARD PLASMA ENHANCED CHEMICALVAPOR DEPOSITION (PECVD) PROCESS, THE BEST FILMS ARE GROWN AT VERY LOW RATES. IF RF POWER IS INCREASED, THE DEPOSITION RATE INCREASES, BUT EFFICIENCY AND STABILITY OF THE SOLAR CELLS DECREASE. AT THE SLOW DEPOSITION RATES, THE CAPITAL COSTS OF MANUFACTURE ARE EXCESSIVE. WE PROPOSE A NEW TYPE OF REACTION CHAMBER USING MAGNETIC ENHANCEMENT OFTHE PLASMA DEPOSITION IN COMBINATION WITH A COST EFFECTIVE ROLL-TO-ROLL MANUFACTURING PROCESS. ADDING A MAGNETIC FIELDCAUSES ELECTRONS IN THE PLASMA TO MOVE IN PATHS THAT REDUCE THE RATE AT WHICH THEY ESCAPE THE PLASMA OR COLLIDE WITH THE SUBSTRATE. THIS RESULTS IN A HIGHER DENSITY PLASMA AND LOWER PLASMA SHEATH POTENTIAL. THE HIGHER PLASMA DENSITY MEANS MORE CHARGED PARTICLES GENERATED WITH LOWER ENERGY PER PARTICLE, AND THE LOWER SHEATH POTENTIAL MEANS LESS VOLTAGE ACCELERATING POSITIVELY CHARGED PARTICLES TOWARD THE SUBSTRATE. THE COMBINATION OF THESE GIVES A HIGHER DEPOSITION RATE WITH LESS BOMBARDMENT DAMAGE TO THE GROWING FILM. THE REDUCED ENERGETICS OF THE GAS PHASE COLLISIONS IS ALSO EXPECTED TO REDUCE GAS PHASE NUCLEATION AND PINHOLE CAUSING DUST FORMATION. ATTAINING UNIFORM FILM THICKNESS USING MAGNETIC FIELD ENHANCEMENT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR STANDARD, FIXED SUBSTRATE, DEPOSITION SYSTEMS BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTY IN ATTAINING A UNIFORM MAGNETIC FIELD OVER LARGE AREAS IN TWO DIMENSIONS. BECAUSE OUR CONTINUOUS ROLL-TO-ROLL PROCESS HAS THE SUBSTRATE ALWAYS MOVING, DEPOSITION RATE VARIATIONS AVERAGE OUT ALONG ONE AXIS SO THAT THE MAGNETIC FIELD ONLY NEED BE UNIFORM OVER ONE DIMENSION.

THE FACT THAT C++ IS AN EXTENSION OF THE C LANGUAGE IS ESPECIALLY NOTABLE. IT HAS MACHINE LEVEL EFFICIENCY AND IT IS PORTABLE ON ANYTHING FROM A CRAY TO A PC. IT HAS GENERALLY BEEN REGARDED AS A LANGUAGE THAT IS NOT EFFECTIVE FOR NUMERICAL CALCULATIONS, BUT NEWER COMPILERS ARE ERASING THIS DISADVANTAGE. THEREFORE, IT SHOULD BE NATURAL TO APPLY OOP TO THE DESIGN OF MODULES FOR SCIENTIC COMPUTATIONS. IN ORDER TO DO THIS IN SUPERCOMPUTER ENVIRONMENTS IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO BUILD AN OOP ENVIRONMENT WITH EXISTING SOFTWARE AND OPERATING SYSTEMS ON THE AFWL CRAY. TO THAT END WE WILL DESIGN A C++ INTERPRETER IN PHASE I AND A C++ COMPILER IN PHASE II USING THE PRESENT CRAY C ENVIRONMENT TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF AN OOP ENVIRONMENT ON A SUPERCOMPUTER ARCHITECTURE. FURTHER, WE WILL BUILD AN OOP NUMERICAL APPLICATION ENVIRONMENT AND WILL DEMONSTRATE THIS ENVIRONMENT WITH A C++ SCIENTIC APPLICATION ON THE CRAY SUPERCOMPUTER.",

TWO TYPES OF MICROWAVE MEASUREMENT CONCEPTS ARE TO BE INVESTIGATED: (A) A TRANSMISSION SYSTEM WHICH OPERATES AT A FEW GHZ, IN WHICH THE AMPLITUDE AND PHASE OF THE MICROWAVE SIGNAL TRANSMITTED THROUGH A LAYER OF GRAIN ARE MEASURED. IN THIS SYSTEM, THE BULK MOISTURE AND DRY BASIS WEIGHT (MASS/AREA) ARE DETERMINED SIMULTANEOUSLY AND INDEPENDENTLY OF THE LAYER THICKNESS: (B) A PROPRITARY RESONATOR WHICH OPERATES AT ABOUT 1 GHZ, AND WHICH CAN BE CONFORMALLY MOUNTED IN A FLOW CHUTE OR INCORPORATED INTO A PORTABLE PROBE FOR INSERTION INTO TRANSPORT OR STORAGE BINS. HERE, THE TWO MEASURED PARAMETERS ARE THE RESONANT FREQUENCY AND THE 3 DB SPECTRAL WIDTH. BOTH TECHNIQUES PERMIT DETERMING MOISTURE, INDEPENDENT OF THE DRY AND WET DENSITIES. LINEAR CALIBRATION MODELS THAT RELATE THE MEASURED PARAMETERS TO MOISTURE WILL BE DEVELOPED, AND LIMITATIONSL TO SENSITIVITY AND RESOLUTION WILL BE IDENTIFIED. BOTH TECHNIQUES ARE EXPECTED TO PERFORM OVER A WIDE DYNAMIC RANGE OF MOISTURE (0 TO 35%) AND SEED SIZE (POWDER CONSISTENCY TO LARGE KERNELS). THE FOOD INDUSTRY HAS A NEED TO RAPIDLY AND ACCURATELY MEASURE MOISTURE CONTENT OF GRAINS AND OTHER FOOD PRODUCTS DURING RECEIVING, DRYING, STORAGE, PROCESSING, AND SHIPPING.ECONOMICAL BENEFITS ARE TO BE GAINED FROM QUALITY CONTROL, INVENTORY CONTROL, AND CONSERVATION OF RESOURCES E.G., ENERGY).

AS THIS SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION CONTINUES TO GROW, ASSESSMENT OF BODY COMPOSITION IS LIKELY TO PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN MEDICAL MANAGEMENT. A DEVICE HAS BEEN DEVELOPED THAT ACCURATELY MEASURES BODY COMPOSITION BY SIMPLY HAVING THE INDIVIDUAL SIT (OR LIE) IN A COMFORTABLE CHAMBER FOR LESS THAN 1 MINUTE. THIS DEVICE IS SUITABLE FOR USE IN BOTH HEALTHY AND PATIENT POPULATIONS.",

HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE CONCERN FOR THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF LOW-LEVEL RADIATION (ESPECIALLY WHEN INGESTED), THIS TEST IS GENERALLY NOT USED IN CHILDREN OR WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE. THE REPLACEMENT OF THE RADIOACTIVE CARBON WITH ITS STABLE ISOTOPE ((13)C), AND ITS DETECTION USING A GAS ISOTOPE RATIO MASS SPECTROMETER, HAS NOW MADE THE TRIOLEIN BREATH TEST AVAILABLE TO ANY POPULATION OF SUBJECTS. A PRINCIPAL LIMITATION IN ITS USE TODAY IS THE HIGH COST OF (13)C-LABELED TRIOLEIN. MARTEK CORPORATION PLANS A BIOLOGICAL APPROACH TO THE SYNTHESIS OF TRIOLEIN. (13)C-TRIOLEIN WILL BE PRODUCED USING A MICROORGANISM GROWING ON A (13)C-LABELED CARBON SOURCE. IT IS HOPED THAT THE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED IN THIS RESEARCH WILL REDUCE THE PRODUCTION COSTS SUCH THAT A 10-FOLD REDUCTION IN COST PER PATIENT TEST CAN BE REALIZED.

THEY POSSES HIGH STIFFNESS AND STRENGTH TO DENSITY RATIOS, HIGH THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY, NEAR ZERO THERMAL EXPANSIONS, AND EXCELLENT THERMAL SHOCK RESISTANCE. THESE MATERIALS, HOWEVER, DUE TO THE NATURE OF THEIR FABRICATION AND PROCESSING, INEVITABLY CONTAIN DEFECTS. THE DEFECTS CONSIST OF BROKEN AND MISALIGNED FIBERS, MATRIX CRACKS, AND OTHER INHOMOGENEITIES AND DISCONTINUITIES SUCH AS EXTREMELY POROUS REGIONS AND LARGE REGIONS OF POORLY BONDED FIBERS RESULTING FROM POOR IMPREGNATION AND CARBONIZATION. TO DATE, THERE IS LITTLE UNDERSTANDING OF THE EFFECTS OF THESE FLAWS ON THE MECHANICAL STRENGTH AND STIFFNESS PROPERTIES, OR ON THE THERMAL PROPERTIES OF THE C-C MATERIALS. THE DEVELOPMENT OF IMPERFECTION ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA FOR C-C MATERIALS IS OF PRIME IMPORTANCE TO THE SUCCESSFUL UTILIZATION OF THESE MATERIALS IN SPACE STRUCTURES. CARBON-CARBON MATERIALS ARE EXPENSIVE; WITHOUT ANALYSIS FOR THE CORRELATION OF MATERIAL FLAWS WITH MATERIAL PERFORMANCE, A COMPREHENSIVE EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM TO DEVELOP ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA IS PROHIBITIVE. THE FOUNDATION FOR ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA DEVELOPMENT, THEREFORE, MUST INCLUDE THE GENERATION OF MATERIAL MODELS WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR THE EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTS OF VARIOUS TYPES AND SIZES OF IMPERFECTIONS ON THE THERMOMECHANICAL PROPERTIES AND STRENGTHS OF C-C COMPOSITES. THE FEASIBILITY OF GENERATING SUCH MODELS IS THE GOAL OF THE PHASE I PROGRAM.",

THE PROBLEM IS MADE ACUTE BY THE INTRODUCTION OF FLAMMABLE PROPELLANTS AND SERIOUS CONCERNS EXIST FOR SAFE TRANSPORT OF THESE CANS IN AIRCRAFT CARGO COMPARTMENTS. THE INITIAL GOAL OF THIS PROPOSED PROJECT IS TO INCREASE THEWORKING PRESSURE FROM THE PRESENT MAXIMUM (DOT 2Q, 270PSI) TO 450 PSI AND TO PROVIDE OPTIONAL RIM VENTING. THIS APPROACH WILL REDUCE FIRE HAZARD AND OFFERS THE FURTHER OPPORTUNITY OF UTILIZING HIGHER PRESSURE NON-FLAMMABLE PROPELLANTS. DURING PHASE I, EFFORTS WILL BE FOCUSED ON THREE-PIECE CANS. LASER WELDING OF DOUBLE SEAMED ENDS WILL BE UTILIZED TO ACHIEVE HIGH STRENGTH END SEAMS. THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL BE COMPARED TO EXTRAPOLATION OF CONVENTIONALDOUBLE SEAM TECHNOLOGY TO OBTAIN SIMILAR HIGH BURST STRENGTHS.

EACH SYSTEM HAS ITS OWN SET OF ADVANTAGES AS WELL AS SHORTCOMINGS. THE NEED REMAINS FOR A MAMMALIAN CELL EXPRESSION SYSTEM THAT CAN ACHIEVE HIGH-LEVEL TARGET GENE EXPRESSION, CORRECTLY PROCESS PROTEINS OF MAMMALIAN ORIGIN, AND IS ECONOMICAL AND EASY TO USE. RECENTLY, MOLECULAR VACCINES, INC., ESTABLISHED A MAMMALIAN EXPRESSION SYSTEM CAPABLE OF SIGNIFICANT PRODUCTION LEVELS OF TARGET PROTEINS. THIS SYSTEM IS BASED ON CO-INFECTION OF CULTURED CELLS WITH TWO RECOMBINANT VACCINIA VIRUSES. ONE RECOMBINANT VACCINIA VIRUS PROVIDES CONSTITUTIVE EXPRESSION OF BACTERIOPHAGE T7 RNA POLYMERASE, AND THE SECOND CONTAINS A T7-PROMOTER-CONTROLLED TARGET GENE. THE TWO-VIRUS SYSTEM WAS REQUIRED FOR STABILITY. IT IS PLANNED TO USE THE REGULATORY ELEMENTS OF THE ESCHERICHIA COLI LAC OPERATOR/REPRESSOR SYSTEM TO REGULATE EXPRESSION OF T7 RNA POLYMERASE. IF EXPRESSION OF T7 RNA POLYMERASE CAN BE CONTROLLED, A SINGLE-VIRUS EXPRESSION SYSTEM MAY BE FEASIBLE. IF SUCCESSFUL, THIS SYSTEM WILL BE EXPLOITED AS A SUPERIOR MEANS FOR THE EFFICIENT BIOPRODUCTION OF MAMMALIAN PROTEINS.",

PREVIOUS RESULTS OBTAINED AT MEMBRANE TECHNOLOGY AND RESEARCH, INC. (MTR) SUGGEST THESE MEMBRANES MAY HAVE REMARKABLE PROPERTIES. THE MEMBRANES ARE EXTREMELY THIN, IN THE RANGE 300-600 A. BECAUSE THEY ARE SO THIN, USEFUL FLUXES OF PERMEABLE GASES SUCH AS HYDROGEN CAN BE OBTAINED AT ROOM TEMPERATURE. THE BEST OF THESE MEMBRANES IS UP TO 10 TIMES MORE PERMEABLE TO HYDROGENAND SIGNIFICANTLY MORE SELECTIVE TO HYDROGEN OVER OTHER GASES THAN THE BEST CURRENTLY AVAILABLE POLYMERIC MEMBRANES. HIGHER SELECTIVITIES WOULD BE ACHIEVABLE IF THE MEMBRANES COULD BE MADE DEFECT-FREE. THIS PROPOSAL DESCRIBES DEVELOPMENT OF A TECHNIQUE FOR DEPOSITING ULTRATHIN METAL FILMS ON POLYMERIC SUPPORTS. THE EARLY DEVELOPMENT WORK WILL PRINCIPALLY BE PERFORMED USING PALLADIUM SILVER ALLOYS AS A MODEL MEMBRANE MATERIAL. IF RESOURCES PERMIT, SOME WORK WILL BE PERFORMED WITH OTHER METALS, SUCH AS SILVER. POLYMER/METAL COMPOSITE MEMBRANES THAT COMBINE HIGH SELECTIVITY WITH HIGH FLUX WOULD BE AN ENTIRELY NEW CLASS OF SEPARATION MEMBRANES. IN THE PHASE I PROGRAM, THE FEASIBILITY OF A CONTROLLED TECHNIQUE FOR PRODUCING METAL MEMBRANES WILL BE DETERMINED.

THIS DUCTILE FAILURE MODE RESULTS IN OPTICAL COMPONENTS RETAINING CLARITY OVER MOST OF THE OPTICAL SURFACE EXCEPT IN AREAS LOCAL TO THE CONTACT REGION. CONSISTENT WITH THE ABOVE, ORGANIC PLASTICS HAVE DISTINCT ADVANTAGES OVER INORGANIC GLASSES FOR BALLISTIC PROTECTION. THE MAIN DISADVANTAGE OF PLASTIC HOWEVER IS ITS SUSCEPTIBILITY TO SCRATCHING AND DEGRADATION DUE TO EXPLOSURE OF ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION WHICH PROMOTES DEGRADATION OF OPTICAL AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES. THESE DISADVANTAGES HOWEVER CAN BE MITIGATED BY INCLUSION OF SURFACE COATINGS. UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS HOWEVER PLASTICS BEHAVE IN A BRITTLE FASHION AND CRACKS AND SPALLS UNDER BALLISTIC IMPACT. THIS BEHAVIOR IS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRESENCE OF PROTECTIVE COATINGS ON THE PLASTIC. THE CURRENT EFFORT INVESTIGATES THE STRESS WAVE RESPONSE OF THE COATING AND PLASTIC ASSEMBLY RESULTING FROM BALLISTIC IMPACT AND INTERACTION OF REFLECTED WAVES WITH SURFACE FLAWS AS A MEANS OF EXPLAINING THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THIS BRITTLE BEHAVIOR LEADING TO METHODOLOGIES FOR PREVENTION.",

IT WAS DEVELOPED BY HAROLD SLINEY OF NASA LEWIS AS AN UNLUBRICATED WEAR COATING FOR STIRLING ENGINES. IT IS UNIQUELY SUITED AS A WEAR/LUBRICANTCOATING FOR APPLICATION OVER A THERMAL BARRIER COATING, TO PERMIT ENGINE OPERATION WITHOUT THE NEED OF EXTERNAL LUBRICATION. A SUCCESSFUL THERMAL BARRIER COATING WILL REDUCE ENGINE HEAT REJECTION, IMPROVING THERMAL EFFICIENCY AND REDUCING COOLING AIR FLOW REQUIREMENTS. IT WILL ALSO ENHANCE THE OPERATION OF THE DIRECT INJECTED, MULTI-FUEL VERSION OF THE ENGINE WHEN IT IS FULLY DEVELOPED. THE SUCCESS OF THIS COATING EVALUATION ON A SIDE HOUSING WILL LEAD TO THE INSULATION OF THE ENTIRE COMBUSTION CHAMBEROF THE ROTARY ENGINE, COATING THE ROTOR HOUSING WITH THE SAME THERMAL BARRIER COATING COMBINATION.",

FLUORS MUST BE DISSOLVED IN THE PLASTIC SUCH THAT THE LIGHT EMISSION OF THE PLASTIC AT 290 NM IS EFFICIENTLY ABSORBED BY THE FLUOR AND RE-EMITTED AT MORE THAN 450 NM. AT THE LATTER WAVELENGTH, THERE IS NEGLIGIBLE RADIATION DAMAGE TO THE PLASTIC AND HENCE THERE IS NO LOSS OF LIGHT TRANSMISSION WITH EXPOSURE OF THE FIBER TO RADIATION DOSES OF 10 MRAD OR MORE. DUE TO THE SMALL FIBER DIMENSIONS A SEQUENCE OF FLUORS TO SHIFT THE WAVELENGTH OF THE LIGHT IS INEFFICIENT. A SINGLE FLUOR WITH LARGE STOKES SHIFT IS HIGHLY DESIRABLE. EXISTING INTRAMOLECULAR PROTON TRANSFER (IMPT) FLUORS ACHIEVE THIS SHIFT BUT HAVE LOW QUANTUM EFFICIENCY ( 35%). LIGHT INTENSITY FROM 200 MICRONS FIBERS WILL BENEFIT GREATLY FROM THE PROPOSED NEW HIGH QUANTUM EFFICIENCY IMPT FLUORS.

ONE SOLUTION WOULD BE TO PERFORM A \"BURN'IN\" OF THE BARE CHIPS (DICE) PRIOR TO THEIR ASSEMBLY INTO A MULTICHIP MODULE. NO PROVEN MANUFACTURING PROCESSES EXIST YET TO DO THIS. IT IS THE ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT TO DEVELOP SUCH A CAPABILITY. OUR GENERAL APPROACH IS TO USE A RELATIVELY LOW-COST HIGH-DENSITY INTERCONNECTION SUBSTRATE SUCH AS A \"SILICON CIRCUIT BOARD\" OR A FLEX-CIRCUIT TO DISTRIBUTE POWER, CLOCK, AND DATA LEVELS TO AN ARRAY OF DIE MOUNTING SITES ON ITS SURFACE. EACH DIE WOULD BE POSITIONED WITH ITS I/O BOND PADS FACING THE INTERCONNECTION SUBSTRATE, WITH MEANS FOR TEMPORARILY ELECTRICALLYCONNECTING THESE BOND PADS TO THE SUBSTRATE FOR THE DURATION OF THE BURN-IN. THE PHASE I EFFORT WILL FOCUS ON EVALUATING THE FEASIBILITY (BOTH ANALYTICALLY AND EXPERIMENTALLY) OF VARIOUS PROPOSED INTERCONNECTION METHODS, WITH EMPHASIS ON RELIABLE ATTACHMENT AND DETACHMENT TO ALUMINUM BOND PAD METALLURGIES, WHILE AVOIDING ANY DAMAGE OR CONTAMINATION TO THE DIE AND ITS BOND PADS.",

TO PROMOTE WELL-ORDERED CRYSTAL GROWTH OF THE SUPERCONDUCTOR LAYER, THE BUFFER LAYER MUST BE DEPOSITED EPITAXIALLY ON THE SUBSTRATE, AND CLOSE CRYSTAL- LATTICE MATCHING BETWEEN THE BUFFER MATERIAL AND SUBSTRATE ARE REQUIRED. SEVERAL MATERIALS - INCLUDING ZRO2, LAGAO3 AND LAALO3, - WILL BE INVESTIGATED FOR THEIR SUITABILITY AS BUFFER LAYERS, AND DOUBLE-LAYER BUFFERS WILL ALSO BE CONSIDERED AS A MEANS OF SATISFYING THE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS. THE EFFORT EMPHASIZES THE USE OF A SINGLE TECHNIQUE, PULSED LASER DEPOSITION, FOR FORMING BOTH THE BUFFER LAYERS AND SUPERCONDUCTOR FILMS.

IN PRACTICE, ROBOTS ARE CONTROLLED BY DIGITAL COMPUTERS AND THE SOLUTION OF THE CONTROL PROBLEM BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION OF CONTINUOUS TIME OPERATION CAN LEAD TO DEGRADATION OF PERFORMANCE AND POSSIBLE INSTABILITY OF THE OVERALL SYSTEM. FURTHERMORE, CENTRALIZED ROBOT CONTROLLERS REQUIRE EXTENSIVECOMPUTER MEMORY AND TIME, SINCE COMPUTATION OF A JOINT TORQUE IS BASED ON THE PROCESSING OF INFORMATION FROM ALL JOINTS. A CENTRALLY CONTROLLED ROBOT IS NOT FAIL-SAFE SINCEIT CAN LOSE CONTROL OF ALL JOINTS IF ONLY ONE JOINT SENSOR IS IN ERROR. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF NETROLOGIC'S PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP A DISCRETE-TIME DECENTRALIZED ADAPTIVE CONTROL SCHEME FOR REAL-TIME DIGITAL CONTROL OF HIGH PERFORMANCE ROBOT MANIPULATORS, AND TO EXPERIMENTALLY DEMONSTRATE ITS PERFORMANCE. SUCH SCHEMES ARE NEEDED SINCE DECENTRALIZED (INDEPENDENT JOINT) CONTROL IS COMPUTATIONALLYEFFICIENT AND IS SUITABLE FOR PARALLEL PROCESSING WITHIN A DISTRIBUTED COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE. THE FIELDS ADAPTIVE CONTROL AND ADAPTIVE NEURAL NETWORKS, HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING INDEPENDENTLY BUT HAVE THE ADAPTATION MECHANISM IN COMMON.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED PHASE I STUDY IS TO IMPLEMENT A SINGLE-JOINTED ARM AND CONTROLLER FOR POSITIONING UNFORESEEN PAYLOADS WITH ACCURATE AND STABLE MOVEMENTS. THE PROPOSED IMPLEMENTATION WILL BE BASED ON A WORKING COMPUTER SIMULATION THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO ACHIEVE AUTONOMOUS ADAPTIVE CONTROL. THE NEURAL ARM HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO ADAPTIVELY CONTROL ANY NUMBER OF SENSORY INPUTS WITH LINKS OF ANY NUMER OF JOINTS. THE FEEDFORWARD NATURE OF CONTROL WILL ALLOW PARALLEL IMPLEMENTATION IN REAL TIME CROSS MULTIPLE JOINTS. IT WILL TOLERATE INTERNAL NOISE, PARTIAL SYSTEM DAMAGE AND CHANGES IN THE MECHANICAL AND SENSORY PARAMETERS OF THE ROBOT AS THEY OCCUR OVER TIME. THIS ADAPTABILITY ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR OPERATOR CALIBRATION. IN PHASE II OF THIS PROJECT, THIS NEURALL CONTROLLER WILL BE EXTENDED TO MULTIPLE JOINTS.",

THIS WILL ALLOW THE USE OF COAL MINE VENTILATION AIR ASTHE FUEL. MEMBERS OF THE PROJECT TEAM HAVE DEVELOPED SEVERAL CONCEPTUAL APPROACHES WHICH COULD HANDLE SUCH AN EXTREMELY DILUTE FUEL. THESE CONCEPTUAL DESIGNS WILL BE EVALUATED TO PRESENT A SYSTEM WHICH WOULD BE TESTED IN THE LABORATORY DURING PHASE II OF THE PROJECT. PROTOTYPE CONSTRUCTION AND COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT WOULD TAKE PLACE IN PHASE III. ONE OF THE PROMISING APPROACHES IS TO USE A ROTATING CERAMIC HEAT EXCHANGER TO RAISE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE PRE-MIXED METHANE-AIR MIXTURE INTRODUCED INTO THE COMBUSTOR. ELEVATED TEMPERATURES LOWER THE METHANE CONCENTRATION REQUIREMENTS FOR COMBUSTION, ALLOWING THE USE OF THE PROPOSED FUEL. METHANE EMISSIONS AT COAL MINES ARE A WASTE OF A NATURAL RESOURCE WHICH HAS DELETERIOUS EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT. U.S. UNDERGROUND MINES EMIT OVER 300 MMCF OF METHANE EACH DAY. THIS IS ENOUGH TO GENERATE OVER 1000 MW OF ELECTRIC POWER. THIS IS ALSO ENOUGH TO GENERATE AN IMPACT ON GLOBAL WARMING. RESEARCH BEING CARRIED OUT AT EPA'S AEERL INDICATES THAT COAL MINE METHANE EMISSIONS IS A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF ANTHROPOGENIC GREENHOUSE GASES. THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY WOULD PROVIDE AN EXCELLENT APPROACH TO MITIGATINGTHIS IMPACT.",

INTERFEROMETRY IS VERY SENSITIVE TO ANGULAR CHANGES BUT THE ANGLE OF PROPAGATION IN A WAVEGUIDE IS SET BY THE GUIDANCE CONDITION. AS A RESULT, NO PHASE CHANGE OCCURS INSIDE THE WAVEGUIDE DUE TO ROTATION. A METHOD TO TRANSDUCE PHASE CHANGE FROM THE FLEXURE OF A CANTILEVER IN A WAVEGUIDE CONFIGURATION IS OUTLINED AND A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF ITS OPERATION IS PRESENTED. SPECIAL ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO REDUCE THE COUPLING LOSSES AMONG THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS. THIS CONFIGURATION IS EXPECTED TO YIELD THE MOST SENSITIVE FIBER-OPTIC ACCELEROMETER BY VIRTUE OF THE MEASUREMENT OF ROTATION. INTERFEROMETRIC FIBER-OPTIC SENSORS EMPLOY SINUSOIDAL PHASE MODULATION BY WRAPPING THE FIBER AROUND A PIEZOELECTRIC CYLINDER. THIS TECHNIQUE HAS LIMITATIONS AND IS NOT MINIATURIZABLE. HIGH FREQUENCY MODULATION WILL BE DONE ELECTRO-OPTICALLY IN A CHANNEL WAVEGUIDE MODULATOR, WHILE LOW FREQUENCY PHASE FEEDBACK WILL BE EFFECTED BY UNBALANCINGTHE INTERFEROMETER AND VARYING THE DRIVE CURRENT IN THE LASER DIODE.

PERFECT VIEW INC. AND THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR HAVE DEVELOPED FOR THE U.S. AIR FORCE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS CHEMICAL COATINGS THAT CHANGE THEIR COLOR IN A QUANTITATIVE MANNER WHEN EXPOSED TO WARFARE GASES. SIMILAR CHROMOPHORIC MIXTURES HAVE ALSO BEEN DEVELOPED FOR OTHER GASES, E.G., WATER, AROMATIC AMINES, HYDROGEN SULFIDES, ETC. THE COATINGS DEVELOPED USE A NOVEL PROPRIETARY CATALYTIC CHEMISTRY (PATENT PENDING) THAT ALLOWS THE DETECTION OF SUB-LETHAL CONCENTRATIONS OF GASES LIKE MUSTARDS (MG) AND NERVE GASES (NG) AT AMBIENT TEMPERATURE IN A TIMESCALE OF THE ORDER OF 20-40 SECONDS WITH A VERY LOW INTERFERENCE, I.E., WITH A VERY HIGH SELECTIVITY. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED WORK IS TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF THE USE OF INTERNALLY-COMPENSATED COATED FIBER OPTIC PAIRS AS MICROSENSORS FOR CONVENTIONAL GASES LIKE CO2, CO, H2O, H2S, ETC., BUT ALSO FOR GASES LIKE MG AND NG USING IRREVERSIBLE BUT VERY SENSITIVE CHROMOPHORIC REACTIONS. BY THE USE OF OUR SPECIFIC KNOW-HOW AND CATALYSTS, WE HAVE PROVED THAT SELECTIVITY MAY BE ACHIEVED BY THE DESIGN OF THE COATING ALONE. THEREFORE, THE UNIQUE FORM OF GAS DETECTOR PROPOSED WILL REQUIRE NO PRISMS, GRATES OR OTHER EXPENSIVE OPTICAL DEVICES THAT REQUIRE PRECISION ALIGNMENT. THUS, THE PROPOSED DETECTOR HAS THE POTENTIAL OF BEING EXTREMELY LOW-COST AS WELL AS ACCURATE AND SELECTIVE. MOREOVER, THE DETECTOR LENDS ITSELF EASILY TO COMPUTERIZED CENTRAL CONTROL AND TO ROUTINE AS WELL AS EMERGENCY WARNING USE. MOST OF THE OPTICS AND ELECTRONICS NEEDED FOR THE DETECTOR CAN BE CONSIDERED KNOWN AND ESTABLISHED TECHNOLOGY. OUR OBJECTIVE IN PHASE I IS TO EXPAND OUR KNOWLEDGE OF COATINGS AND TO INTEGRATE THEM ONTO THE PROPER OPTIC FIBERS AND ELECTRONICS TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED DETECTOR PERFORMANCE.",

THE PROPOSED FABRY-PEROT RESONATOR HAS TWO UNIQUE STRUCTURES. FIRST, THE MIRRORS OF THE FABRY-PEROT RESONATORS ARE HOLOGRAPHICALLY FABRICATED IN A COHERENTLY-COUPLED MANNER. THUS, THE STRINGENT ALIGNMENT PROBLEMS BETWEEN THE TWO MIRRORS ARE ELIMINATED.

SECOND, A MULTIPLEXED VOLUME HOLOGRAM (CONTAINING MANY SUPERIMPOSED PHASE GRATINGS) IS PLACED IN THE CAVITY. THEREFORE, MANY MULTIPLEXED OPERATIONS CAN BE PERFORMED AT THE SAME TIME (I.E. HIGH PARALLELISM). FOR EXAMPLE, A MULTIPLE-CHANNEL NARROWBAND WAVELENGTH DIVISION MULTIPLEXER IS REALIZABLE IN A SINGLE FABRY-PEROT RESONATOR. IN ADDITION, THE STORAGE CAPACITY OFTHE VOLUME HOLOGRAM IN THE RESONATOR IS DRAMATICALLY INCREASED DUE TO THE RESONANCE EFFECT.

THE NOVELTY OF POC'S APPROACH INCLUDES THE USE OF ITS UNIQUE HOLOGRAPHIC TECHNOLOGY WHICH ALLOWS THE PRODUCTION OF VERY HIGHLY EFFICIENT LIGHT COLLECTORS IN THE ENTIRE VISIBLE AND NEAR IR SPECTRAL RANGE. SPECIFICALLY, POC'S IR HOLOGRAMS REPRESENT THE STATE-OF-THE-ART IN HOLOGRAPHY AND HAVE NOT BEEN MATCHED EVEN IN THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY. FURTHERMORE, THE NEW TYPE OF HOLOGRAMS ARE STABLE AT HIGH (200 DEGREE C) AND LOW (-180 DEGREE C) TEMERATURES AS WELL AS UNDER HUMIDITY AND VACUUM CONDITIONS GENERALLY EXPERIENCED IN THE SPACE APPLICATIONS. THIS SYSTEM INVOLVING POC'S VISIBLE AND IR HOLOGRAMS ADDRESSES THE PROBLEMS OF LOW SOLAR CONVERSION EFFICIENCY AND HIGH CONCENTRATOR WEIGHT THROUGH THE USE OF DIFFERENT PHOTOVOLTAIC RECEIVER MATERIALS. BECAUSE OF THE SEPARATE PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS, EACH WITH A DIFFERENT BAND-GAP ENERGY, RECEIVING ONLY THOSE SOLAR PHOTONS WITH ENOUGH ENERGY TO PRODUCE ELECTRON-HOLE PAIRS, THE EFFICIENCY OF CONVERSION IS HIGH. THE HOLOGRAPHIC OPTICAL ELEMENTS USED IN THIS SYTEM ARE INHERENTLY LIGHTWEIGHT AND FLAT, MAKING DEPLOYMENT SIMPLE. OVERALL, THIS RECEIEVER IS MORE EFFICIENT IN POWER, SIZE AND WEIGHT THAN EXISTING SYSTEMS. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - THE SYSTEM IS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OVER THE USE OF CONVENTIONAL PHOTOVOLTAIC RECEIVERS IN SPACE POWER SYSTEMS. EFFICIENCY WILL BE BETTER THAN THAT OBTAINED FROM A TENFOLD CONCENTRATION OF SOLAR RADIATION. ADDITIONALLY, CELL LIFE WILL BE EXTENDED BECAUSE PROTONS THAT ONLY CONTRIBUTE TO HEAT (AND NOT TO USEABLE ENERGY) WILL BE REJECTED BY DIFFRACTION. KEY WORDS - HOLOGRAPHIC, HOLOCONCENTRATOR, ENERGY, PHOTOVOLTAIC, SOLAR, WAVELENGTH SEPARATION",

IN PHASE I, THE FEASIBILITY OF SEVERAL PROCESSES WILL BE INVESTIGATED BY PRODUCING LABORATORY SAMPLES SUITABLE FOR QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS. TWO ALTERNATIVE DESIGNS WILL BE PURSUED: A MULTICONDUCTOR CONCENTRIC SAMPLE AND A PLANAR RIBBONIZED SAMPLE. METHODS AND TECHNIQUES TO TERMINATE EACH CONFIGURATION TO PLANAR ELECTRODES SPACED AT 75 AND 300 MICRONS WILL BE EXPLORED. COMPREHENSIVE MECHANICAL, ELECTRICAL, AND PRELIMINARY BIOCOMPATIBILITY CHARACTERIZATION OF THE LABORATORY SAMPLES WILL BE PERFORMED TO ASSESS THE SUITABILITY FOR THE IN VIVO APPLICATION. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS OBTAINED DURING PHASEI SHOULD PROVIDE INSIGHT APPROPRIATE TO DIRECTING LARGER SCALE MANUFACTURING AND MORE EXTENSIVE BIOCOMPATIBILITY STUDIES AS PART OF THE PHASE II RESEARCH.

THE SECOND, PROPRIETARY ABSORBENT REMOVES THE OTHER HALF OF THE SULFUR FROM THE HOT GAS STREAM. AFTER ABSORPTION OF H2S, THE PROPRIETARY ABSORBENT IS REGENERATED BY THE SO2 PRODUCED FROM ZINC FERRITE REGENERATION.

CHILL STORAGE SYSTEMS USING COMPLEX COMPOUNDS HAVE HIGHER STORAGE DENSITIES (BOTH MASS DENSITY AND VOLUMETRICALLY) THAN CONVENTIONAL SYSTEMS SUCH AS ICE STORAGE, AND CAN BE USED AT LOWER TEMPERATURES. THE COMPOUNDS ADSORB AMMONIA DURING DISCHARGE OF THE CHILL STORAGE AND CAN BE DIRECTLY COUPLED WITH AMMONIA REFRIGERATION SYSTEMS. THEY ARE CHARGED BY DESORBING THE COMPLEX COMPOUNDS WITH A COMPRESSOR DURING OFF-PEAK HOURS. COMPLEX COMPOUNDS CAN ALSO BE USED AS STORAGE MEDIA FOR DUALTEMPERATURE TES, PROVIDING BOTH HEAT AND CHILL STORAGE WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT COMPARED TO THAT REQUIRED FOR CHILL STORAGE ALONE. THE DIFFERENCE IN TEMPERATURE BETWEEN THE TWO STORAGE TEMPERATURES IS DETERMINED BY THE VAPOR PRESSURE CURVE OF THE AMMONIATED COMPLEX COMPOUND. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEMONSTRATE DUAL TEMPERATURE CHILL STORAGE ON A LABORATORY SCALE AND USE LABORATORY RESULTS TO PROJECT SIZE AND COST OF A FULL SCALE SYSTEM. THE DEMONSTRATION WILL BE TIED TO AN ACTUAL DUAL TEMPERATURE TES APPLICATION AND WILL BE PERFORMED AT ACTUAL OPERATING TEMPERATURES AND PRESSURES. EVALUATION CRITERIA WILL BE (1) ABILITY TO PROVIDE HEAT AND CHILL STORAGE AT THE REQUIRED TEMPERATURES, (2) REFRIGERANT HOLDING CAPACITY, AND (3) APPROACH TEMPERATURE REQUIRED TO CHARGE (DESORB) THE SYSTEM;APPROACH TEMPERATURE HAVING A DIRECT INFLUENCE ON CHARGING ENERGY REQUIRMENTS.",

THERMAL STORAGE EQUIPMENT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE THE OVERALL SYSTEM MASS BY DECREASING THE CAPACITY REQUIREMENTS OF HEAT PUMPS, REFRIGERATORS AND CHILLERS THROUGH LOAD LEVELING. TODAY'S THERMAL STORAGE CONCEPTS, HOWEVER, ARE INADEQUATE FOR SPACE APPLICATION, SINCE THE ENERGY DENSITIES ARE VERY LOW (333 KJ/KG THEORETICAL MAXIMUM FOR ICE COOL STORAGE) AND NONE OF THE ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE SYSTEMS CAN PROVIDE DUAL TEMPERATURE (HEAT AND COOL) STORAGE. THEREFORE, IT IS PROPOSED TO DEVELOP A WATER BASED CHEMICAL ABSORPTION PROCESS WHICH PROVIDES COOL AND HEAT STORAGE AT ENERGY DENSITIES THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN OBTAINABLE WITH ICE, EUTECTIC SALTS, CLATHRATES OR SENSIBLE THERMAL STORAGE SYSTEMS. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM IS BASED ON THE ABSORPTION OF WATER VAPOR INTO SELECTED AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS, IS ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE AND BENEFITS FROM LOW GRAVITY ENVIRONMENTS. THE PHASE I OBJECTIVE IS TO IDENTIFY SUITABLE SORPTION SYSTEMS, MEASURE THE KEY PROPERTIES, DESIGN THE PRINCIPAL HARDWARE CONFIGURATION AND PROVIDE EXPERIMENTAL PROOF-OF-PRINCIPLE. PHASE II WILL THEN FOCUS ON THE DETERMINATION OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER ADDITIVIES AND THE CONSTRUCTION AND TEST OF A PROTOTYPE THERMAL STORAGE SYSTEM.",

THESE ACTIVE TRUSSES ARE STRUCTURAL MEMBERS THAT INCORPORATE SENSORS AND ACTUATORS, ALLOWING CLOSED LOOP CONTROL OF BOTH THE SPACE STRUCTURE SHAPE AND SUPPRESSION OF UNWANTED STRUCTURAL VIBRATIONS. IN THE PAST, THESE ACTIVE TRUSS MEMBERS HAVE INCORPORATED PIEZOELECTRIC OR ELECTRODYNAMIC ACTUATORS. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN MAGNETOSTRICTIVE MATERIALS, HOWEVER, OFFER THE OPPORTUNITY FOR INCREASED STRAIN, INCREASED POWER DENSITY, AND DECREASED HYSTERESIS COMPARED TO PIEZOELECTRIC MATERIALS. FOR EXAMPLE, MAXIMUM STRAINS AND POWER DENSITIES CAN BE OVER A ORDER OF MAGNITUDE HIGHER THAN FOR PIEZOELECTRICS.

THE USE OF EPITHERMAL INSTEAD OF THERMAL NEUTRONS FOR BNCT IS ADVANTAGEOUS DUE TO THE GREATER PENTRATION DEPTH OF EPITHERMAL NEUTRONS IN TISSUE, WHICH SPARES SKIN DURING TUMOR IRRADIATION. EPITHERMAL NEUTRONS ARE PRODUCED BY BOMBARDING A LITHIUM TARGET WITH AN INTENSE PROTON BEAM FROM A CASCADE TANDEM ACCELERATOR (CTA). THE CTA IS A NOVEL ELECTROSTATIC ACCELERATOR THAT COMBINES TWO EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES INTO A SIMPLE, COMPACT PROTON ACCELERATOR SUITABLE FOR OPERATION IN A HOSPITAL ENVIRONMENT. PRELIMINARY CALCULATIONS INDICATE THAT A 1-MA, 2- TO 2.5-MEV PROTON BEAM INCIDENT ON THE TARGET WILL PROVIDE SUFFICIENT EPITHERMAL NEUTRON FLUX FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES AND FOR TUMOR IRRADIATION. IN THIS STUDY, TARGET AND NEUTRON MODERATOR GEOMETRY WILL BE MODELED USING MONTE CARLO TECHNIQUES TO DETERMINE THE OPTIMUM TARGET ASSEMBLY DESIGN AND PROTON BEAM PARAMETERS.

THE CURRENT METHODS FOR THESE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS RELY ON REAGENTS THAT ARERADIOACTIVE OR ENZYME LINKED. IN THESE STUDIES, A METHOD WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR ASSAYING GLYCOLIPIDS ON SOLID SUPPORTS THAT IS MORE RAPID AND 3 TO 6 ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE MORE SENSITIVE THAN EXISTING TECHNIQUES AND DOES NOT UTILIZE RADIOISOTOPES. THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY EXPLOITS THE REMARKABLE SENSITIVITY OF THE RECOMBINANT BIOLUMINESCENT PROTEIN, AEQUORIN, AND THE HIGH-AFFINITY INTERACTIONS OF STREPTAVIDIN AND BIOTIN. THIS RESEARCH HAS THREE SPECIFIC AIMS. FIRST, ASSAYS WILL BE ESTABLISHED USING LUMINESCENCE DETECTION REAGENTS (LDR'S)FOR ASSAYING FORSSMAN GLYCOLIPID, A HUMAN TUMOR ANTIGEN, IN MICROTITER PLATES. SECOND, THIS ASSAY WILL BE ADAPTED TO DETECT GLYCOLIPIDS SEPARATED BY THIN-LAYER CHROMATOGRAPHY.

IT HAS THE CAPABILITY OF BEING MODULATED AT 20 MHZ RATE WITH 40 DB CARRIER SUPPRESSION AND LOW RESIDUAL OUTPUT NOISE. FOR 5-BIT APPLICATIONS ONLY THE TOP 5 MOST SIGNIFICANT BITS NEED TO BE DRIVEN. THE USE OF THE DIGITAL LINEARIZATION TECHNIQUES ALLOWS FOR A SINGLE DEVICE TO SIMULTANEOUSLY SATISFY THE LARGE BANDWIDTH, HIGH-BIT PHASE RESOLUTION, AND HIGH CARRIER SUPPRESSION REQUIREMENTS. THE PHASE I EFFORT WILL BE ON ESTABLISHING ITS FEASIBILITY THROUGH THE ANALYSIS AND DESIGN OF THE ENTIRE PHASE SHIFTER, HARDWARE COMPONENTS DEFINITION, AND A BREADBOARD DEMONSTRATION.",

THE SOC UTILIZES A MINIMUM DISTANCE CRITERION AND IT IS TOTALLY DATA ADAPTIVE IN THAT NO A PRIORI LIBRARY INFORMATION IS NEEDED TO SET UP AN INITIAL CLUSTER CONFIGURATION. CLASSIFICATION WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE USE OF AN ADAPTIVE NETWORK SENSOR PROCESSOR (ANSP) WHICH CAN UTILIZE INCOMPLETE OR NOISY PULSE DESCRIPTOR WORDS, SUCH AS MIGHT OCCUR IN WARM SITUATIONS.

HOWEVER, THE RISK OF INJURY TO THE UPPER TORSO AND HEAD DUE TO SECONDARY IMPACTS IS STILL UNACCEPTABLY HIGH. ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THIS IS THAT THE STANDARD FIVE-POINT RESTRAINT SYSTEM IS NOT DESIGNED TO RESTRAIN LATERAL MOTION, AND IMPACTS WITH HIGH VERTICAL LOADS RESULT IN COMPRESSION OF THE UPPER TORSO AND EXTENSIVE HEAD AND TORSO MOTION WITHIN THE RESTRAINT. NEWER AIRCRAFT, SUCH AS LHX, WILL INCREASE THIS HAZARD BY REDUCING THE COCKPIT VOLUME, BRINGING EVEN MORE ITEMS WITHIN THE STRIKE ENVELOPE OF THE SEATED OCCUPANT, AND BY INCREASING SPEED AND MANUEVERABILITY, RESULTING IN CRASH IMPACTS WITH HIGHER ENERGY AND A WIDE VARIANCE OF AIRCRAFT ATTITUDES. A PROGRAM TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF INSTALLING AIRBAGS INTO A HELICOPTER COCKPIT TO REDUCE THE SECONDARY IMPACT HAZARDS IS OUTLINED. THE FOUR-TASK RESEARCH EFFORT INCLUDES AN EVALUATION OF INJURY PATTERNS, COMPUTER MODELING OF BODY KINEMATICS, DEVELOPMENT OF PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS, AND CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF AN AIRBAG SYSTEM. THE LAST TASK, DEVELOPING CONCEPTUAL DESIGNS, IS A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF THE PHASE I EFFORT AND WILL DRAW HEAVILY FROM STATE-OF-THE-ART AUTOMOTIVE AIRBAG TECHNOLOGY.",

THE TM,HO:YAG LASER, EMITTING IN THE 2.09 MICROMETER EYE-SAFE SPECTRAL REGION, HAS PROVEN EFFECTIVE IN DETECTING WIND SHEAR AND ATMOSPHERIC MICROBURSTS IN THE VICINITY OF AIRPORT LANDING PATHS. THE ND:YLF LASER IS USED FOR ATMOSPHERIC SENSING APPLICATIONS. THE DIODE LASER ARRAY IS AN EFFECTIVE OPTICALPUMPING METHOD BECAUSE OF ITS HIGH EFFICIENCY, HIGH RELIABILITY, SMALL VOLUME AND WEIGHT. TO MAKE THIS DIODE LASER PUMPING SCHEME A COMMERCIAL REALITY, A REPRODUCIBLE AND INEXPENSIVE PROCESS IS REQUIRED. THE MAIN CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE HIGH COST OF DIODE LASER PUMP ARRAYS HAS BEEN THE LOW YIELD OF EPITAXIAL MATERIAL EMITTING AT THE PROPER WAVELENGTH. SPIRE'S UNIQUE CONTRIBUTION TO THIS EFFORT IS THAT WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE ABILITY TO MAKE QUANTUM-WELL STRUCTURES OF HIGH UNIFORMITY OVER TWO-INCH WAFERS IN SPIRE'S COMMERCIALLY-AVAILABLE PRODUCTION MOCVD REACTOR. THE PROPOSED EFFORT BUILDS ON SPIRE'S PRESENT 808 NANOMETER DIODE LASER ARRAY ACTIVITIES. OPERATIONAL LASER ARRAYS WILL BE FABRICATED AND DELIVERED UNDER THIS PROGRAM.",

A SMALL JUNCTION WIDTH, FURTHERMORE, WOULD MAKE POSSIBLE EFFICIENT COLLECTION OF LONG-WAVELENGTH LIGHT WITHOUT A LONG CARRIER DIFFUSION LENGTH, RESULTING IN GOOD RADIATION RESISTANCE. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE SMALL JUNCTION WIDTH (10 TO 20 MICRONS) WHICH IS NEEDED, WE WILL USE ION IMPLANTED SILICIDES FOR THE METAL INTERCONNECTION LAYERS. COSI2, WHICH HAS A HIGH CONDUCTIVITY AND A SMALL LATTICE MISMATCH WITH SILICON, CAN BE FORMED AS A BURIED LAYER BY ION IMPLANTATION OF COBALT AND ANNEALING. HIGH-QUALITY EPITAXIAL SILICON CAN BE GROWN ON THE TOP LAYER AFTER THIS PROCESS. THIN FILMS PRODUCED BY THIS METHOD ARE GENERALLY COHERENT AND UNIFORM AND THEIR INTERFACES ARE SHARP AND FREE FROM CONTAMINATION.

IN PHASE I, THE COMPONENTS OF THE PROKARYOTIC LAC OPERON WILL BE TESTED IN STABLY TRANSFECTED MOUSE L CELLS. CELLS EXPRESSING THE LAC REPRESSOR WILL THEN BE STABLY TRANSFECTED WITH CHIMERIC GENE CONSTRUCTS CONTAINING THE LACOPERATOR SEQUENCE. WILD-TYPE AND TIGHT-BINDING REPRESSORS AND OPERATOR SEQUENCES WILL BE TESTED. THE EFFICIENCY OF NUCLEAR TRANSPORT OF THE LAC REPRESSOR CONTAINING A SIGNAL PEPTIDE SEQUENCE WILL BE TESTED BY MEASURING THE NUCLEAR CONCENTRATION OF THE LAC REPRESSOR, AND BOTH THE LEVEL OF REPRESSOR EXPRESSION AND THE NUMBER AND RELATIVE POSITIONING OF OPERATOR SEQUENCES WILL BE TESTED. ALTHOUGH THESE EXPERIMENTS WILL FOCUS ON MAXIMAL REPRESSION FOR GENES REQUIRING LOW LEVELS OF EXPRESSION, CONDITIONS FOR MAXIMAL INDUCTION WILL ALSO BE DETERMINED. PRELIMINARY INDUCTION STUDIES WILL BE EXTENDED TO QUANTITATE INDUCER UPTAKE OVER LONG AND SHORT INDUCTION PERIODS. INDUCTION OF THE CHIMERIC GENES WILL OCCUR THROUGH THE EXPOSURE OF AN EXOGENOUS INDUCER INTRODUCED THROUGH THE DRINKING WATER OR BY INTRAPERITONEAL INJECTION.",

THESE SITES HAVE NOT BEEN WIDELY STUDIED DUE TO THE DIFFICULTY IN DISSECTING THE RELATIVELY SMALL QUANTITIES OF NEURAL TISSUE FROM THE NON-NEURAL TISSUE. MOLECULAR CLONING AND HETEROLOGOUS EXPRESSION OF THE 5-HT1P RECEPTOR WILL GREATLY FACILITATE STUDY OF THIS RECEPTOR AND WILL PROVIDE A KEY TOOL FOR THE DISCOVERY OF DRUGS AFFECTING THIS RECEPTOR SITE. BOTH ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL AND RECEPTOR-BINDING DATA INDICATE THATTHE 5-HT1P RECEPTOR IS A MEMBER OF THE G PROTEIN RECEPTOR SUPERFAMILY. HOWEVER, THE SECOND MESSENGER TO WHICH THIS RECEPTOR IS COUPLED HAS NEVER BEEN DETERMINED. ELUCIDATION OF THE SECOND-MESSENGER PATHWAY IN PHASE I OF THIS PROJECT WILL ALLOW THE ASSIGNMENT OF THE 5-HT1P RECEPTOR TO A PARTICULAR STRUCTURAL CLASS OF SEROTONIN RECEPTORS AND WILL GREATLY FACILITATE DESIGN OF A CLONING STRATEGY.

MANIPULATION OF 3-D OBJECTS SUCH AS TRANSLATION AND ROTATION IS SIMPLIFIED WITH THIS CLASS OF ARCHITECTURES BECAUSE OPTICAL SIGNALS TRAVEL ORTHOGONAL TO THE DEVICE SUBSTRATES, WHICH RELIEVES PINOUT CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED BY ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES. PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS OF THE OPTICAL SYSTEMS LIMIT STORAGE DENSITY, SPEED, SPACE-BANDWIDTH PRODUCT, AND OTHER CHARACTERISTICS, WHICH WILL BE STUDIED IN PHASE I.

THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THESE OBJECTIVES WILL ANSWER TWO BASIC QUESTIONS REGARDING THE FEASIBILITY OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH: WHAT PRACTICAL STRUCTURES CAN BE BEST USED TO DETECT NON-GAUSSIAN ACOUSTIC SIGNALS?

THE SEED CRYSTAL TO BE USED IS C-ORIENTATION SAPPHIRE. THE RAW MATERIALS REQUIRED FOR THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL BE SYNTHESIZED THROUGH THE HYDROLYTIC DECOMPOSITION OF MIXED METAL ALKOXIDES. FOR FIBER GROWING, THE PROCESSING PARAMETERS TO BE CONTROLLED ARE: DEGREE OF SUPERHEATING, GROWTH RATES, THERMAL GRADIENTS AND CAPILLARY SIZES. THROUGH VARYING THE ABOVE PROCESSING PARAMETERS, VARIOUS FIBER DIAMETERS, AS WELL AS DIFFERENT EUTECTIC MICROSTRUCTURES WOULD BE OBTAINED. EXTENSIVE TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY (TEM) AND X-RAY DIFFRACTION (XRD) ANALYSES WILL BE CARRIED OUT TO DETERMINE THE GROWTH DIRECTION AND CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC RELATIONS OF ALUMINA AND YAG EUTECTIC. ROOM TEMPERATURE STRENGTH OF THE EUTECTIC FIBERS WILL BE MEASURED IN TENSION. AN EXTENSIVE SEM FRACTOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS WILL BE CARRIED OUT TO STUDY THE CRACK/MICROSTRUCTURE INTERACTIONS OF THE EUTECTIC FIBERS.",

THE COMPUTER AIDED INTERACTIVE-SIMULATION WILL INCLUDE LEARNER OPTIONS DEPENDANT UPON AGE, KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, AND MOTIVATION. EACHSIMULATION WILL COMBINE ANIMATION, GRAPHICS, DECISION-MAKINGOPTIONS, RESPONSE EVALUATIONS, FEEDBACK, AND ALTERNATIVE CHOICES, PROMPTING INTERACTION TO POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE SITUATIONS.

THE PROGRAM WILL HELP THE LEARNER TO UNDERSTAND THE CAUSES OF DRUG USE AND THE \"HOW\" AND \"WHY\" PEOPLE START USING DRUGS. AT THE SAME TIME, IT WILL HELP THE LEARNER BUILD SELF-ESTEEM AND CREATE A POSITIVE PEER-PRESSURE NOT TO USE DRUGS. CONDITIONS DEFINED IN A PRELIMINARY ON-LINE QUESTIONNAIRE (E.G., NAME, GRADE, OR EXPRESSED LEARNING OBJECTIVE (SELECTED FROM LIST SUPPLIED ON-SCREEN)) WILL IMPLEMENT CONDITIONAL LEARNING PATHS. THE FINAL PRODUCT WILL BE AN AGE-DEPENDENT SERIES OF COMPUTER INTERACTIVE TRAINING PROGRAMS, UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF ONE EXPERT SYSTEM, THAT IS EDUCATIONALLY SOUND, HIGHLY INDIVIDUALIZED, ENTERTAINING, EASILY UPDATED, AND VERY AFFORDABLE. WITH MINIMAL MODIFICATION, THIS SYSTEM WILL EASILY BE ADAPTED TO OTHER DISCIPLINES OR, IN PARTICULAR, OTHER AREAS OF DRUG EDUCATION.",

THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES NOVEL CONCEPTS USING THE ABRASIVE-WATERJET (AWJ) TECHNIQUE. THE TECHNICAL AND ECONOMICAL FEASIBILITY OF THIS TECHNIQUE WILL BE DETERMINED IN PHASE I, WHILE IN PHASE II, THE FULL MACHINING PROCESS WILL BE DEMONSTRATED. THE AWJ TECHNIQUE WILL ALLOW THE MACHINING OF PARTS IN THE CYLINDRICAL SHAPE, AS OPPOSED TO THE METHOD USED NOW OF MILLING FLAT PATTERNS, ROLLING THEM, AND THEN WELDING. AN AWJ MOUNTED ON A ROBOT ARM WILL BE USED TO MILL THE PATTERNS OF THE OSGRID FROM THE INSIDE OF THE PART. TWO MILLING STRATEGIES WILL BE INVESTIGATED: IN THE FIRST, LINEARLY TRAVERSING JETS WILL BE USED, WHILE IN THE OTHER, ROTARY JETS WILL BE USED. A SMALL PATTERN TEMPLATE (OR TEMPLATES) OF HARD MATERIAL (MACHINED WITH THE AWJ) WILL BE USED IN THE MILLING PROCESS AS A MASK(S) SO THAT MILLING OF DIFFERENT \"POCKET\" SHAPES CAN BE OBTAINED WITH SIMPLE JET TRAVERSAL OVER THE MASK. SIMPLE EXPERIMENTS WILL BE CONDUCTED IN PHASE I TO DETERMINE THE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE RESULTS OF AWJ ISOGRID MACHINING.

        "abstract": "Abstract         SOLID RESIDUE FROM COAL-FIRED FLUIDIZED-BED COMBUSTORS CREATES TWO PROBLEMS: IT IS HARD TO DISPOSE OF, AND THERE IS TOO MUCH OF IT. THE PROPOSED PROGRAM INTRODUCES A METHOD FOR CONDITIONING FBC RESIDUE THAT SOLVES THE FIRST PROBLEM, AND REDUCES THE SECOND. THE OPERATING DIFFICULTIES IN DISPOSAL ARE CAUSED BY THE UNREACTED LIME WHICH, WHEN WETTED FOR DUST CONTROL, EMITS DUSTY STEAM AND FORMS CLINKERS. THE DUSTY STEAM CREATES AN AIR POLLUTION PROBLEM, WHILE THE CLINKERS HAMPER TRUCK UNLOADING AND CAN ENDANGER IT. UNREACTED LIME ALSO CREATES A FIRE HAZARD AT SANITARY LANDFILLS. SHIPPING UNCONDITIONEDRESIDUE SHIFTS THESE PROBLEMS FROM THE PLANT TO THE LANDFILL, REQUIRING THE USE OF DEDICATED LANDFILLS THAT ALSO ARE REMOTELY LOCATED WHERE AIR POLLUTION LAWS ARE LESS STRINGENT. THIS ADDS TO THEIR COST AND REDUCES THEIR AVAILABILITY, PARTICULARLY FOR SMALL INDUSTRIAL PLANTS. PRESENT METHODS TO CONDITION FBC RESIDUE USE CONVENTIONAL ASH CONDITIONER MIXERS BY ADDING JUST ENOUGH WATER TO MOISTEN THE RESIDUE. THE IMPRACTICALITY OF ADEQUATELY CONTROLLING THE WATERFLOW WHILE PROCESSING FBC WASTE IS AT THE HEART OF THE PROBLEM. THE PROPOSED METHOD QUENCHES THE RESIDUE IN A TANK OF WATER. SETTLED RESIDUE IS REMOVED FROM THE TANK'S BOTTOM, THE EXCESS WATER IS DRAINED OFF, AND THE MATERIAL IS LOADED INTO A TRUCK FOR DISPOSAL. IN THE ADVANCED VERSION, THE HYDRATED RESIDUE IS ALSO RECYCLED TO THE FBC TO REDUCE LIMESTONE CONSUMPTION, AND THE CONDITIONED RESIDUE IS PROCESSED TO RECOVER LIME. THE PROPOSED PROCESS HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO ELIMINATE BOILING, CLINKER FORMATION, AND THE NEED TO CONTROL THE WATER-SOLIDS RATIO. WITH THESE IMPROVEMENTS, THE NEED FOR DEDICATED LANDFILLS, AND TRUCK UNLOADING, SHOULD ALL BE ELIMINATED.",

THE SYSTEM WOULD BE PROGRAMMABLE; VOLUME WILL STAY WITHIN 200 INCH; OUTPUT CAN BE DIGITAL OR NTSC ANALOG. THE SYSTEM IS INTENDED FOR USE IN EXTREMELY SEVERE AIRBORNE CONDITIONS. UNLIKE CONVENTIONAL ELECTRONIC MEMORY SYSTEMS, THE PROPOSED SYSTEM WOULD HAVE TWO HEADS AND 8 OPTICAL FIBERS (CHANNELS) TO READ AND WRITE ON BOTH SIDES OF A DISK, AND THUS REALIZE HIGHER SPEEDS. ACCESS TIMES ARE MUCH SHORTER, THE SYSTEM WOULD USE A LIGHTWEIGHT HOLOGRAPHIC OPTICAL HEAD WITH A MOVING MASS OF LESS THAN 10 GRAMS. THE DESIGN WOULD UE A SHORT (680 NM) INSTEAD OF A LONG WAVELENGTH (823 NM) LASER DIODE, THEREBY INCREASING THE RECORDING DENSITY AT LEAST 50%. A PHILIPS AIR STANDARD STRUCTURE IS CONSIDERED, WITH A PHASE-CHANGE ERASABLE MATERIAL SUCH AS THE SELENIUM-INDIUM-ANTIMONY ALLOY. A 12 INCH DISK WOULD YIELD AT LEAST 30 SECONDS OF VIDEO DATA.",

THIS IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE FACT THAT ROTARY MACHINES CAN ROTATE AT HIGHER SPEEDS THAN RECIPROCATING DEVICES. A HIGH EFFICIENCY, LARGE DISPLACEMENT ROTARY COMPRESSOR OFFERS VERSATILITY AND FEATURES THAT EXISTING RECIPROCATING COMPRESSORS DO NOT POSSESS. AN ADVANCED MARINE PROPULSION CONCEPT THAT IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSIDERATION REQUIRES THE COMBUSTION OF HIGH PRESSURE AIR IN CONJUNCTION WITH A COLUMN OF WATER TO PRODUCE A HIGH MOMENTUM WATER JET PROPULSION SYSTEM. THE PROPOSED ROTARY COMPRESSOR, WHICH WILL BE CONSIDERED IN THIS EFFORT, HAS FEATURES INCORPORATED INTO ITS DESIGN THAT MINIMIZE THE AMOUT OF INTERNAL LEAKAGE AND DECREASE THE INTERNAL FRICTION. A WORKING PROTOTYPE OF THE PROPOSED COMPRESSOR HAS BEEN FABRICATED AND TESTED ON A SMALLER SCALE THAN THAT REQUIRED FOR THE WATER JET PROPULSER. THE PROPOSED EFFORT WILL INVESTIGATE THE SCALE UP OF THIS COMPRESSOR TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE WATER JET PROPULSER TO DETERMINE COMPRESSOR PERFORMANCE, WEIGHT AND CONFIGURATION OPTIMIZATION. THE COMPRESSOR PROPOSED HAS THE CAPABILITY OF VARIABLE PRESSURE RATIO. USE OF A VARIABLE PRESSURE RATIO COMPRESSOR MAY ALSO BE MORE ADAPTABLE TO VARYING POWER REQUIREMENTS.

IF POSSIBLE, WE WILL USE THE INCREMENTAL NATURE OF THE UV-INDUCED CURRENT IN A LEARNING ALGORITHM. A BUILT IN LEARNING ALGORITHM WILL ALSO COMPENSATE FOR VARIATIONS IN NEURON AMPLIFIERS DUE TO FABRICATION IRREGULARITIES. OUR EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION TECHNIQUE WILL RELY HEAVILY ON DESIGN, FABRICATION, AND TESTING OF SMALL INTEGRATED CIRCUITS. WE WILL FOCUS ON OVERCOMING CIRCUIT PROBLEMS AND PRODUCING WORKING LABORATORY PROTOTYPES. TEST CHIPS WILL BE FABRICATED THROUGH MOSIS.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE COMPANY HAS DEVELOPED A UNIQUE, THIN-FILM SENSOR DESIGN THAT WHEN INTEGRATED WITH A STRUCTURAL MEMBER COULD DETECT FATIQUE CRACKS, CORROSION, AND ICE ACCRETION AS WELL AS EXTERNAL PRESSURE VARIATIONS INDICATIVE OF AN IMPENDING WINGSTALL. THESE SENSORS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING SOFTWARE CAN BE INTEGRATED INTO AN ADVANCED HEALTH MONITORING SYSTEM (HMS) TO EXTEND SIGNIFICANTLY THE LIFE SPAN OF THE AGING, COMMERICIAL AIRCRAFT FLEET. BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF SMART STRUCTURES, THE HMS IS DESIGNED TO EMULATE THE HUMAN NERVOUSSYSTEM. AN ARRAY OF SENSORS (\"NERVES\") LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE AIRCRAFT STRUCTURE WILL BE CONNECTED BY A COMMON DATA BUS OR NETWORK TO A SIGNAL PROCESSING CHIP (\"BRAIN\"). THE HMS WILL CONTINUOUSLY SCAN SENSOR ARRAYS INTEGRAL WITH THE AIRCRAFT SKIN. BY MONITORING THE STRUCTURAL VIBRATION SIGNATURES INDUCED UNDER NORMAL AERODYNAMIC LOADING, THE HMSWILL DETERMINE STRUCTURAL ABNORMALITIES THROUGH PATTERN ]RECOGNITION TECHNIQUES. WHEN AN ABNORMALITY IS DETECTED, THE SYSTEM WILL IDENTIFY IT, LOG THE TIME AND LOCATION, AND ISSUE A WARNING. THIS SYSTEM HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR LIFETIMEMONITORING OF STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES AND PROVIDING REAL-TIME,NON-DESTRUCTIVE EVALUATION IN FLIGHT. IN ADDITION TO EXTENDING THE LIFE OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT, THIS TECHNOLOGY MAY ALSO FIND APPLICATION IN MONITORING STRAIN IN LARGE STRUCTURES, SUCH AS BUILDINGS, SHIPS, STORAGE TANKS, DAMS, BRIDGES, AND IN MONITORING EARTHQUAKES.",
