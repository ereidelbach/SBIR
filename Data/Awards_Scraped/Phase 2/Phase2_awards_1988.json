PARTICLE CONTAMINATION CAN BE REDUCED BY FILTRATION, BUT SIMILAR APPROACHES TO ADDRESS CHEMICAL CONTAMINATION ARE NOT COMMONLY AVAILABLE. INERT GASES SUCH AS HYDROGEN AND HELIUM ARE NOW ROUTINELY PURIFIED AT THE POINT OF USE, BUT THE REACTIVE GASES USED IN CVD REQUIRE MORE SOPHISTICATED PURIFICATION TECHNIQUES. BY USING SUPPORTED REAGENTS, ON-LINE PURIFIERS CAN BE DESIGNED THAT WILL REMOVE OXYGEN, WATER, AND CERTAIN OTHER CONTAMINANTS FROM THE BROAD SPECTRUM OF REACTIVE GASES. DURING PHASE I A UNIFYING THEORY FOR REDUCING THE CONTAMINANTS IN THESE GASES TO PARTS PER BILLION LEVELS WILL BE TESTED. A PURIFIER WILL BE BUILT, ANALYTICAL METHODS DEVELOPED, AND ITS PURIFICATION CAPABILITY DEMONSTRATED. PHASE II WILL INCORPORATE THE DESIGN AND TESTING OF PURIFIERS FOR EACH OF THE REACTIVE PROCESS GASES AND ON-LINE EVALUATION DURING ACTUAL DEVICE FABRICATION.",

MOST OF THESE PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN IGNORED BECAUSE RELATIVELY LOW VOLUMES OF CHEMICALS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH SEMICONDUCTOR FABRICATION. HOWEVER, THE EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH TOXICITY OF THESE MATERIALS CAN CAUSE MAJOR PROBLEMS FOR SMALL QUANTITY HAZARDOUS WASTE GENERATORS. SILANE, PHOSPHINE AND/OR ARSINEARE USED IN CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION (CVD) STEPS IN SEMICONDUCTOR FABRICATION. LARGE USERS HAVE BUILT EXPENSIVEFACILITIES FOR HANDLING SMALL AMOUNTS OF THESE MATERIALS, BUT SMALL GENERATORS HAVE VENTED TO THE ATMOSPHERE OR USED SIMILARLY UNACCEPTABLE TECHNIQUES. ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY MATERIALS, INC. (ATM) PROPOSES TO BUILD A NOVEL VENT GAS SCRUBBER THAT WILL BE COST-EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING TOXIC AIR EMISSIONS FROM CVD PROCESSES. THE METHODOLOGY TO BE EMPLOYED WILL RESEMBLE THAT USED BY ATM TO DESIGN PUR-IFICATION DEVICES FOR THESE SAME GASES, EXCEPT THAT A BIFUNCTIONAL DEVICE WITH SCAVENGING CAPABILITY IS ENVISIONED THAT IS FULLY AUTOMATED TO HANDLE ANY SYSTEM SURGES.

THIS UNIT OPERATES BY PRODUCING A HIGH-VOLTAGE ALTERNATING CURRENT ELECTRIC DISCHARGE ACROSS THE INTERFACE BETWEEN A WASTE HYDROCARBON AND WATER. THE EXTREMELY HIGH TEMPERATURE WITHIN THE ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE IS SUFFICIENT TO CAUSE LOCALIZED FAST PYROLYSIS OF THE ADJACENT HYDROCARBONS. THE PRESENCE OF WATER REDUCES THE BUILD UP OF CARBON VIA A WATER GAS REACTION. MOREOVER THE WATER PHASE PERMITS THE INTRODUCTION AND/OR WITHDRAWAL OF VARIOUS IONIC VARIOUS IONIC SPECIES FROM THE LOCALIZED HIGH-TEMPERATURE REACTION ZONE. PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTS INDICATE THAT HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC WASTES DISSOLVED OR SUSPENDED IN EITHER THE WATER OR OIL PHASE ARE COMPLETELY REFORMED. PRODUCT STREAMS CONSIST OF ACLEAN GAS PLUS A SOLID PRECIPITATE. THE GAS WITH A COMPO- SITION OF H20, CO, AND HYDROCARBONS CAN BE USED AS FUEL. THETHE SOLID PRECIPITATE IS A HIGHLY OXIDIZED SLUDGE. THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL INVESTIGATE THE PERFORMANCE OF A PILOT PLANT MODEL OF THIS DEVICE TO DETERMINE IF IT CAN IN- DEEN BE USED SUCCESSFULLY TO TREAT TOXIC OR HAZARDOUS WASTES. OTHER OBJECTIVES OF THE PROGRAM ARE TO DETERMINE: (1) WHETHER TOXIC ACID GASES (HCL, H2S, HCN, ETC.)

MOST ROBOTS, HOWEVER, EITHER PERFORM REPETITIVE PREPROGRAMMED OPERATIONS OR ARE GUIDED BY A HUMAN OPERATOR. THIS IS NOT PRACTICAL IN MANY APPLICATIONS WHERE AUTONOMOUS OPERATION IS REQUIRED, AND THE MOST IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENTS IN FUTURE GENERATIONS OF ROBOTS, ESPECIALLY FOR SPACE APPLICATIONS, WILL COME IN THE AREAS OF OBJECT RECOGNITION AND DECISION MAKING. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, ROBOT MANIPULATOR CONTROL WILL REQUIRE CLOSED LOOP, SENSOR BASED SYSTEMS TO OBTAIN AND ANALYZE INFORMATION FROM THE MANIPULATOR ABOUT ITS NEIGHBORHOOD. PROGRESS IN THIS AREA IS AT PRESENT LIMITED PARTIALLY BY SENSOR TECHNOLOGY. TO ADDRESS THE LIMITATIONS FOUND IN PRESENT PROXIMITY SENSOR SYSTEMS, WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE A NOVEL APPROACH TO MAKING A RELATIVELY SIMPLE BUT VERY PRECISE PROPORTIONAL PROXIMITY SENSOR WHICH WILL BE INDEPENDENT OF THE OBJECTS MATERIAL OR SURFACE PROPERTIES. OUR APPROACH INVOLVES THE USE OF NUCLEAR BACKSCATTER USING SMALL ISOTOPIC SOURCES AND COMPACT, LIGHTWEIGHT SENSORS WHICH CAN BE CONTAINED WITHIN THE MANIPULATOR. THIS APPROACH IS STRAIGHTFORWARD AND REQUIRES RELATIVELY SIMPLE ELECTRONICCIRCUITRY AND THUS, IF SUCCESSFUL, IT COULD BE READILY IMPLEMENTED ON THE NEXT GENERATION OF ROBOTS.",

THE CODE WILL ACCURATELY MODEL SHOCKS, BOUNDARY LAYERS, BLUNT BODY FLOWS, COOLING BY TRANSPIRATION AND SLOT INJECTION, SIDE-THRUSTING JETS, BASE FLOWS, AND REAL GAS EFFECTS. THE PHASE I OBJECTIVES ARE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BASIC CODE AND THE OPTIMIZING OF THE NUMERICAL ALGORITHM FOR HYPERSONIC FLOW FIELDS. THE APPROACH IS BASED ON MODIFING AN EXISTING 3D IMPLICIT FLUX-SPLIT NAVIER-STOKES CODE. THE NUMERICAL ALGORITHM WILL BE OPTIMIZED BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THAT LARGE REGIONS OF THE FLOW FIELD WILL BE PREDOMINANTLY SUPERSONIC. A MULTIPLE ZONE CAPABILITY WILL BE ADDED TO ALLOW GEOMETRICALLY DISTINCT REGIONS WITH INDEPENDENT MESHESTO BE NUMERICALLY COUPLED ALONG COMMON BOUNDARIES. THE PHASE I CODE WILL BE DEMONSTRATED FOR A CASE HAVING SLOT INJECTION COOLING WITH A HYPERSONIC FREESTREAM.",

A MAJOR IMPEDIMENT TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH A TEST HAS BEEN THE LACK OF A SUITABLE SYSTEM FOR CULTURING HUMAN TUMORS IN VITRO SO THAT THEY REPRESENT TUMORS IN THE IN VIVO STATE. TO OVERCOME THIS PROBLEM, ANTICANCER, INC. HAS RECENTLY DEVELOPED A TUMOR CULTURE SYSTEM FOR THE IN VITRO GROWTH OF DIVERSE HUMAN TUMORS IN AN IN VIVO-LIKE WAY. THIS SYSTEM ALLOWS OVER 75% OF EXPLANTED TUMORS TO BE GROWN FOR PERIODS OF TIME THAT AVERAGE OVER 90 DAYS. THE TUMORS ARE EXPLANTEDON GELS DERIVED FROM PIGSKIN RICH IN EXTRACELLULAR-MATRIX BASEMENT-MEMBRANE COMPONENTS SUCH AS VARIOUS COLLAGENS AND LAMININ. THIS TUMOR CULTURE SYSTEM ALLOWS THE READY MEASUREMENT OF DNA AND PROTEIN SYNTHESIS IN INDIVIDUAL CELLSWITHIN TUMORS BY AUTORADIOGRAPHIC TECHNIQUES. THIS RESEARCHWILL UTILIZE THIS METHOD OF HUMAN TUMOR CULTURE TO DETERMINETHE CRITICAL PARAMETERS FOR IN VITRO DRUG SENSITIVITY TESTING WITH THE EVENTUAL GOAL OF DETERMINING WHICH PARAMETERS ARE THE MOST PREDICTIVE OF THE IN VIVO RESPONSE OF TUMORS TO DRUGS. IN THIS LIGHT, CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC DRUGS WILL BE TESTED FOR THEIR EFFECT ON DNA SYNTHESIS, PROTEIN SYNTHESIS, AND CELL VIABILITY STAINING IN A QUANTITATIVE MANNER. IN CONCERT WITH THE ABOVE EXPERIMENTS, ANTIBODIES WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE SPECIFIC CELL-TYPE MARKERS WITHIN THE VARIOUS TYPES OF HUMAN TUMOR CULTURES GROWING IN VITRO IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY THE ESSENTIAL NATURE OF CELLS WITHIN TUMORS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY CRITICAL FOR MEASURING DRUG SENSITIVITIES. TUMORS OF THE BREAST, LUNG, AND, COLON WILL BE EMPHASIZED. PATIENT RESPONSE DATA WILL BE OBTAINED AND CORRELATED TO IN VITRO CHEMOSENSITIVITIES TO DETERMINE THE MOST PREDICTIVE IN VITRO PARAMETERS. THE EXPERIMENTS PROPOSED HERE SHOULD ALLOW A MAJOR ADVANCE TOWARD THE GOAL OF A COMMERCIAL DRUG SENSITIVITY TEST.",

APPLICATION OF THESE COMPUTATIONALLY COMPLEX ALGORITHMS IS LIMITED TO RELATIVELY SHORT RNA STRANDS. APPLIED SCIENCES CONSULTANTS, INC. PROPOSES THAT FOLDING PATTERNS OF RNAS BE PREDICTED BY EMPLOYING AN ALGORITHM BASED ON MONTE CARLO METHODS OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS, WHICH INCLUDES AN ANNEALING PROCEDURE. MONTE CARLO METHODS, IN CONTRAST TO MINIMIZATION ROUTINES, SCAN MANY LOCAL MINIMA, CALCULATE STATISTICALLY AVERAGED PROPERTIES, AND PREDICT MELTING PATTERNS. THESE METHODS ARENOT LIMITED BY COMPUTER STORAGE REQUIREMENTS AND THEREFORE CAN HANDLE RNAS OF THE ORDER OF A FEW THOUSAND NUCLEOTIDES. PRELIMINARY RESULTS FOR SMALL RNAS ARE PRESENTED AND A FEASIBILITY STUDY IS PROPOSED TO EVALUATE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE NEW ALGORITHM, DETERMINE MELTING AND REFOLDING OF SHORT RNA MOLECULES, AND PREDICT SECONDARY STRUCTURES OF SELECTED LONG RNAS. LONG-TERM GOALS INCLUDE GENERALIZATION AND FURTHER IMPROVEMENT OF THE ALGORITHM AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF A RAPID AND RELIABLE SOFTWARE FOR ANALYSIS OF LARGE RNA SEGMENTS.

THESE RESULTS SET THE STAGE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN EXTREMELY USEFUL MATERIAL--LARGE PLANAR WAFERS OF SMOOTH GAAS ON SILICON. DOUBLE SELECTIVE LIQUID PHASE EPITAXY COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY LATTICE MISMATCH AND DIFFERENTIAL THERMAL EXPANSION BY REDUCING THE AREA OF CONTACT BETWEEN ADJACENT SEMICONDUCTOR LAYERS TO SMALL NUCLEATION VIAS ONLY MICRONS IN DIAMETER. SMOOTH, PLANAR LOW-DISLOCATION GALLIUM ARSENIDE OVERGROWTH IS BEING PREPARED BASED ON THE DSLE PROCESS BY CONTROLLING THE THERMOCHEMISTRY AND KINETICS OF THE GAAS OVERLAYER GROWTH TO ELIMINATEFACETING. LIQUID PHASE EPITAXY IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN LOWER RESIDUAL BACKGROUND IMPURITY LEVELS THAN OTHER GROWTH TECHNIQUES. STABLE SEMI-INSULATING GAAS LAYERS ARE BEING PREPARED BY LOW LEVEL DOPING WITH A DEEP LEVEL ACCEPTOR. MATERIAL QUALITY AND UNIFORMITY ARE BEING DEMONSTRATED BY FABRICATING SIMPLE MAJORITY AND MINORITY CARRIER DEVICES. A FEASIBILITY STUDY AND EQUIPMENT DESIGN FOR 16 SQUARE INCH GAAS-ON-SILICON WAFERS IS BEING COMPLETED.",

HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE ROLE OF SILICON IN HUMAN NUTRITION AND METABOLISM. THE ABSENCE OF A RELIABLE ANALYTICAL TOOL FOR TRACE AND ULTRA-TRACE ELEMENTAL AND ISOTOPIC DETERMINATIONS HAS BEEN A MAJOR IMPEDIMENT TO THE ACQUISITION OF KNOWLEDGE. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN LASER RESONANCE IONIZATION HAVE PRODUCED A UNIQUE ANALYTICAL TOOL - RESONANCE IONIZATION MASS SPECTROMETRY (RIMS) - TO PERMIT THE MICRODETERMINATION OF SILICON IN BIOLOGICAL TISSUES AND FLUIDS. RIMS IS PROPOSED TO IONIZE SILICON SENSITIVELY AND SELECTIVELY IN THE PRESENCE OF OTHER ELEMENTS AND IMPURITIES, FOLLOWED BY QUANTITATION WITH ISOTOPE DILUTION AS AN INTERNAL STANDARD. THE TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES FOR PHASE I ARE: 1) TO DEVELOP AND DEMONSTRATE A PROCESS TO ATOMIZE ULTRA-TRACE QUANTITIES OF SILICON; 2) TO DEVELOP AND APPLY A RESONANCE IONIZATION SCHEME FOR THE SELECTIVE AND SENSITIVE IONIZATION OF SILICON IN THE PRESENCE OF OTHER ELEMENTS AND IMPURITIES; 3) TO DETERMINE, WITH MINIMUM CHEMICAL PRETREATMENT, ULTRA-TRACE QUANTITIES OF SILICON IN SELECTED BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES. PHASE I RESEARCH WILL PROVIDE THE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL BRIDGE TO PERMIT THE APPLICATION OF SILICON DETERMINATIONS TO SPECIFIC PROBLEMS IN NUTRITION AND METABOLISM. THE TECHNOLOGY WILL BE APPLICABLE TO THE DETERMINATION OF NUTRITIONAL REQUIREMENTS, PARTICULARLY FOR THE AGED, AND POTENTIALLY TO THE DIAGNOSIS AND SCREENING OF ATHEROSCLEROTIC DISORDERS.

ALUMINUM IS REMOVED AS DISCHARGE PROCEEDS, SINCE ONE OF THE PRODUCTS IS AN INSOLUBLE COMPLEX BETWEEN THE ALUMINUM, REDUCED SO2, AND THE CARBON SURFACE. THE DILEMMA IS THAT ADDING MORE ALUMINUM AS LIALCL4, WHILE IT MIGHT IMPROVE THE CAPACITY, WOULD ALSO RAISE THE ELECTROLYE FREEZING POINT TO AN UNACCEPTABLE HIGH LEVEL. WE PROPOSE TO CHANGE THE COMPOSITION OF THE ELECTROLYTE SUCH THAT THE LOW FREEZING POINT IS MAINTAINED, YET ADDING SOLUTES WHICH ARE LIKELY TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY. IN ADDITION, INSOLUBLE MATERIALS WHICH COULD BE INSTRUMENTAL IN INCREASING THE CAPACITY BY ENCOURAGING THE FORMATION OF COMPLEXES SIMILAR TO THE ONE WHICH FORMS ON THE KETJENBLACK NOW USED IN THESE CELLS WILL BE ADDED TO THE CARBON POSITIVE ELECTRODE. WE EXPECT IMPROVEMENTS IN SAFETY THROUGH THE ADDITION TO THE ELECTROLYTE OF MATERIALS WHICH WOULD IMPROVE THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE PLATED LITHIUM.",

DESPITE A PLETHORA OF ATTRACTIVE FEATURES, ENZYMES HAVE NOT BEEN WIDELY ACCEPTED AS ROUTINE CATALYSTS FOR THE PREPARATION OF PURE ENANTIOMERS. ONE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT MANY ENZYMES REQUIRE COFACTORS CALLED COENZYMES TO BE CATALYTICALLY ACTIVE. COENZYMES ARE EXPENSIVE AND MAKE THE PROCESS UNECONOMICAL. A GROUP OF ENZYMES PARTICULARLY WELL SUITED FOR THE PREPARATION OF PURE ENANTIOMERS ARE THE OXIDOREDUCTASES THAT USE NICOTINAMIDE ADENINE DINUCLEOTIDE (NAD) AS A COENZYME. PRACTICAL PROCESSES CAN BE DEVISED USING CATALYTIC QUANTITIES OF THE COENZYME WHEN THE ENZYME REACTION IS COUPLED TO A COENZYME REGENERATION SCHEME. THE BEST CURRENTLY AVAILABLE COENZYME REGENERATION SCHEMES HAVE A NUMBER OF DRAWBACKS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: 1) THEY USE EXPENSIVE ENZYME CATALYSTS, AND 2) THE REGENERATION SCHEME PRODUCES BYPRODUCTS THAT COMPLICATE THE ISOLATION OF THE DESIRED PRODUCT. IN THIS PROPOSAL BEND RESEARCH, INC. DESCRIBES A NEW PROCESS FOR NADH REGENERATION USING THE INEXPENSIVE ENZYME ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE OBTAINED FROM YEAST.

HOWEVER, METHODS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR HYDROGEN SEPARATIONS ARE COSTLY AND INEFFICIENT. POLYMERIC MEMBRANESNOW IN USE ARE CAPABLE OF ONLY LIMITED SELECTIVITY, WHICH LEAVES SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF IMPURITIES IN THE HYDROGEN STREAM. THOSE MEMBRANES ARE ALSO HEAT-SENSITIVE; CONSEQUENTLY, MANY HYDROGEN-CONTAINING FEED STREAMS MUST BE COOLED BEFORE PROCESSING. METAL MEMBRANES OVERCOME MOST OF THESE PROBLEMS BY BEING HIGHLY SELECTIVE AND RESISTANT TO TEMPERATURES OF UP TO 500 DEGREE CELLCIUS. HOWEVER, CURRENT METALLIC HYDROGEN-SEPARATION MEMBRANES HAVE AN EXTREMELY HIGH CAPITAL COST, AS THEY ARE COMPOSED OF PALLADIUM ALLOYED WITHSILVER. IN THIS PROGRAM, BEND RESEARCH, INC. WILL EXAMINE THE TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY OF REPLACING THIS COSTLY MATERIAL WITHA TITANIUM ALLOY THAT IS HIGHLY PERMEABLE TO HYDROGEN. IN ORDER TO PREVENT OXIDES FROM FORMING ON THE SURFACE OF THE ALLOY AND THUS IMPEDING HYDROGEN TRANSPORT, ALLOY FILMS WILLBE CLEANED AND THEN COATED WITH A THIN LAYER ( 1 ) OF A NON-OXIDIZING METAL SUCH AS PALLADIUM OR NICKEL.

THE APPLICATION OF MEMBRANES TO INDUSTRIAL-SCALE SEPARATIONS WOULD BE ACCELERATED SIGNIFICANTLY BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW MEMBRANE MATERIALS AND CONCEPTS THAT LEAD TO IMPROVEMENTS IN BOTH OF THESE AREAS. IN THIS PROGRAM A NOVEL, ULTRATHIN MOLECULAR-SIEVE MEMBRANE WILL BE DEVELOPED THAT CONSISTS OF AN ARRAY OF ORDERED CHANNELS. THE CHANNELS WILL HAVE THREE IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTICS: (1) CHANNEL DIAMETERS WILL BE OF MOLECULAR DIMENSIONS, (2) ALL CHANNELS WILL HAVE THE SAME DIAMETER, AND (3) THE CHANNELS WILL TRAVERSE THE MEMBRANE. THE PLANNED MOLECULAR-SIEVE MEMBRANE IS EXPECTED TO EXHIBIT HIGH PERMEATE FLUX (DUE TO ITS EXTREME THINNESS), HIGH CHANNEL DENSITY, AND A HIGH DEGREE OF CHANNEL ORIENTATION. ADDITIONALLY, THE MOLECULAR-SIEVE MEMBRANE IS EXPECTED TO EXHIBIT HIGH SELECTIVITY AMONG CLOSELY RELATED MOLECULAR STRUCTURES (E.G., STRUCTURAL AND GEOMETRIC ISOMERS) BECAUSE OF THE CHANNEL CHARACTERISTICS LISTED ABOVE.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY (MEG) IS THE NONINVASIVE MAGNETIC MEASUREMENT OF ELECTRICAL CURRENT WITHIN THE BRAIN WHICH IS BELIEVED TO GIVE SIGNIFICANT NEW INFORMATION ABOUT BRAIN FUNCTION THAT COMPLEMENTS OTHER MODALITIES SUCH AS EEG AND PET. USING MEG, SOURCES OF NORMAL AND PATHOLOGICAL BRAIN ACTIVITY HAVE BEEN LOCALIZED TO A FEW MILLIMETERS IN THREE DIMENSIONS. THE MEG BANDWIDTH EXTENDS DOWN TO DC TO ALLOW EVALUATION OF INJURY CURRENTS AND VERY LOW-FREQUENCY CHANGESIN NEURONAL ACTIVITY. ENVIRONMENTAL NOISE IS FREQUENTLY THE LIMITING FACTOR FOR MEG MEASUREMENTS. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO IMPROVE THE MEG SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO BY A COMBINATION OF SHIELDING,INSTRUMENT DESIGN, AND SIGNAL PROCESSING. SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME OF THIS WORK WILL BE ESPECIALLY BENEFICIAL TO MEASUREMENTS OF SPONTANEOUS MEG WHERE SIGNAL AVERAGING IS NOT FEASIBLE AND TO DETECTION OF SIGNALS FROM SUBCORTICAL SOURCES. THIS PROJECT HAS IMMEDIATE SIGNIFICANCE IN THE CLINICAL EVALUATION OF EPILEPSY PATIENTS BEING CONSIDERED FOR SURGICAL TREATMENT. OTHER POTENTIAL AREAS OF BENEFIT INCLUDE EVALUATION OF NEUROMUSCULAR DISORDERS AND OBSERVATION OF DC CURRENTS ASSOCIATED WITH SPINAL CORD INJURIES.",

IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE THE MECHANISM OF IP3 ACTION AND TO DEVELOP THERAPEUTIC DRUGS THAT ACT BY DUPLICATING OR INHIBITING IP3 ACTION, ONE ESSENTIAL LINE OF RESEARCH IS TO STUDY IP3 BINDING TO ITS RECEPTOR.

        "abstract": "Abstract         THIS PROPOSAL IS A UNIQUE AND INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO CONSTRUCTING 2-D GAAS ACOUSTO-OPTIC LIGHT DEFLECTORS FOR HIGH POWER LASER APPLICATIONS WITHOUT THE USE OF MIRRORS. ADVANTAGES OF SUCH SYSTEM OVER CONVENTIONAL LASER BEAM MIRRORS ARE THE INABILITY OF MIRRORS TO DEFLECT AT HIGH SPEEDS DUE TO THE MIRROR'S INERTIA. AS A RESULT WITH ELECTRONIC ACOUSTO-OPTIC DEVICES, THEIR PERFORMANCE AND HENCE SPEED IS THAT OF THE ORDER OF ELECTRONIC SWITCHING. ALSO MIRRORS REQUIRE LARGE POWER CONSUMPTIONS WHEREBY ACOUSTIC RF POWER GENERATIONS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS. AN ADVANTAGE OF CONSTRUCTING ACOUSTO-OPTIC LASER BEAM DEFLECTORS IS THAT DEFLECTION ANGLE IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE FREQUENCY. FOR EXAMPLE, WITH PRESENT BRIMROSE ACOUSTO-OPTIC DEVICES LASER BEAM DEFLECTION ANGLES ARE TYPICALLY 6-12 DEG GHZ. IN THE LAST THREE YEARS, BRIMROSE HAS BEEN A PIONEER IN DESIGNING AND CONSTRUCTING ACOUSTO-OPTIC LASER BEAM DEFLECTORS. IN 1984, WE WERE THE FIRST COMPANY TO COMMERCIALLY INTRODUCE A 1-D 40% DIFFRACTION EFFICIENCY LASER BEAM DEFLECTOR FROM GALLIUM PHOSPHIDE (GAP) THAT OPERATES AT 1 GHZ CENTER FREQUENCY WITH A DEFLECTION ANGLE OF 10 DEGREES FOR A HENE LASER. BRIMROSE WOULD LIKE TO EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OF USING OUR PROPRIETARY FABRICATION TECHNOLOGY TO CONSTRUCT 2-D LASER BEAM DEFLECTOR FOR HIGH POWERED ND:YAG (1.06 MICROMETERS) LASER APPLICATIONS. ALSO, IT SHOUD BE NOTED THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY WITH MODIFICATIONS CAN BE USED FOR FABRICATING AN OPTICAL COMPUTER WITH SPEEDS GREATER THAN THE PRESENT STATE-OF-THE-ART CRAY COMPUTERS.",

THE TOOLS MOST FREQUENTLY USED BY HF RESEARCHERS TODAY CAN NO LONGER BE EXPECTED TO KEEP PACE WITH THE RAPID ADVANCES IN MILITARY SYSTEMS. THE TECHNOLOGIES OF TODAY'S ADVANCED SYSTEMS REQUIRE THE HUMAN OPERATORS TO RELY MORE ON THEIR COGNITIVE SKILLS THAN ON PSYCHOMOTOR SKILLS, AS IN YEARS PAST. A METHOD IS PROPOSED HEREIN FOR IDENTIFYING ADVANCED TOOLS WITHIN THE CURRENT LITERATURE AND WITHIN THE FIELD OF BASIC AND APPLIED HUMAN RESEARCH. THE PHASES DURING SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT WHEN THE TOOLS ARE MOST LIKELY TO BE USED WILL BE IDENTIFIED. THE TOOLS WILL THEN BE TAXONOMIZED BY CATEGORY, FUNCTION, AND CLASS, WITH A DESCRIPTION OF THEIR ANALYTIC, DESIGN, EVALUATION, OR INTEGRATIVE FEATURES. MILITARY HF SPECIALISTS WILL BE ASKED TO IDENTIFY THE ADVANCED RESEARCH TOOLS WHICH THEY BELIEVE WILL BEST FACILITATE HF EVALUATIONS OF THE SOLDIER-MACHINE INTERFACE. FINALLY, A COST-EFFECTIVENESS MATRIX WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR DETERMINING IF THE GAINS IN PERFORMANCE JUSTIFY THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROCURING AND MASTERING A NEW TOOL.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         TWO QUESTIONS ARE OFTEN ASKED IN LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT: HOW CAN I (E.G. SUPPLY THE UNIT WITH AMMUNITION); WHAT IF (E.G. ENEMY DISTRUPTS SUPPLY LINES). THE COUPLING OF HUMAN EXPERTISE WITH ANALYTIC MODELS ALLOW SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED. BUT MANY OF THESE PROBLEMS ARE SO COMPLEX THAT THE MATHEMATICS ARE INTRACTABLE, REQUIRING THE USE OF SIMULATION, WHICH CAN BE BOTH EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING. MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE EXPERTISE REQUIRED TO USE SIMULATION EFFECTIVELY MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE. IT APPEARS THAT AI PLANNING AND KNOWLEDGE BASED SIMULATION TECHNIQUES, WHEN COUPLED TOGETHER, CAN ENHANCE THE PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF HUMAN LOGISTICS PLANNERS. THIS PROPOSAL FOCUSES ON TWO ISSUES: PLANNING TECHNIQUES FOR ANSWERING \"HOW CAN I\" QUESTIONS, AND ITS LINKAGE TO; KNOWLEDGE BASED SIMULATION TECHNIQUES FOR ANSWERING \"WHAT IF\" QUESTIONS. OUR APPROACH TO PLANNING WILL BE TO CONSTRUCT AN INTERACTIVE PLANNER WHICH USES KNOWLEDGE TO CRITICIZE AND GUIDE THE PLANNING PROCESS. THE PLANNER WILL BE CONSTRUCTED USING A BLACKBOARD ARCHITECTURE, ENABLING IT TO BE PERUSED BY THE LOGISTICIAN AND EFFECTIVELY COUPLED WITH THE SIMULATION SYSTEM. THE MAJORITY OF OUR EFFORT WILL FOCUS ON SIMULATION TOOLS. FOR THE CLASS OF COMPLEX PROBLEMS FOR WHICH SIMULATION IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY, KNOWLEDGE BASED SIMULATION (KBS) (REDDY ETAL., 1986) CAN BE USED MOST EFFECTIVELY TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS. HOWEVER, THE CONSTRUCTION AND ANALYSIS OF KBS MODELS STILL REMAINS EXPENSIVE. ALTHOUGH AI REPRESENTATION TECHNIQUES ARE USE, THE DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION, AND ANALYSIS OF KBS MODELS REQUIRES A VARIETY OF KNOWLEDGE (E.G., DOMAIN INFORMATION, STATISTICAL ANALYSISTECHNIQUES) AND SKILLS (E.G., EXPERIMENT DESIGN) POSSESSED BY FEW. CONSEQUENTLY, WE WILL FOCUS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF KNOWLEDGE BASES WHICH EXTEND KBS IN THE AREAS OF EXPERIMENT DESIGN AND ANALYSIS.",

HOWEVER, VALVES OF ONE TYPE OF CRYOCOOLER, THE JOULE-THOMPSON EXPANSION CRYOCOOLER, ARE PRONE TO PLUGGING BY THE FREEZING OF IMPURITIES IN THE HIGH-PRESSURE STREAM. TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, A RADICAL APPROACH FOR PROVIDING A HIGH-PRESSURE GAS STREAM OF 100% PURE OXYGEN TO A JOULE-THOMPSON EXPANSION DEVICE IS BEING INVESTIGATED. THE COMPRESSOR, A MONOLITHIC SOLID-STATE DEVICE CONTAINING NO MOVING PARTS, IS BASED ON THE SELECTIVE TRANSPORT OF OXYGEN IONS THROUGH A CERAMIC OXYGEN IONIC CONDUCTOR UNDER AN APPLIED VOLTAGE. ELEMENTARY CONSIDERATIONS SHOW THAT THE CERAMIC STRUCTURE MUST HAVE A VERY LOW RESISTANCE, THEREBY ELIMINATING THE PARTIALLY STABLIZED ZIRCONIAS. THE FEASIBILITY OF AN ALTERNATIVE, PROPRIETARY CERAMIC IS BEING ASSESSED THAT OFFERS TWO OUTSTANDING ADVANTAGES: OXYGEN IONIC CONDUCTIVITIES 30-50 LARGER THANTHE BEST ZIRCONIAS AND FAVORABLE SINTERING TEMPERATURES FOR FABRICATING VERY LOW RESISTANCE CELLULAR-HONEYCOMB STRUCTURES. BASEDON MEASURED OXYGEN-GENERATION RATES, MODEL CALCULATIONS ARE BEING CARRIED OUT FOR VARIOUS HONEYCOMB-TYPE GEOMETRIES TO STUDY POWER CONSUMPTION, PRESSURE, MASS-FLOW RATE, SIZE, AND EFFICIENCY. IDEAL JOULE-THOMPSON EXPANSION CYCLES ARE BEING STUDIED FOR REFRIGERATION CAPACITY AT TEMPERATURES 50-90K.",

THE APPROACH IS BASED UPON IN-HOUSE PRODUCTION OF COMPOSITE SPECIMENS IN THE FORM OF 3.2 MM DIAMETER RODS THAT CAN BE TESTED DIRECTLY IN FLEXURE, IN SHORT-BEAM SHEAR, IN TORSION, OR FOR FRACTURE ENERGY AT CRYOGENIC TEMPERATURES BEFORE AND AFTER IRRADIATION.

THE MAIN THRUST OF THIS PROJECT IS TO EXTEND THE SPECIMEN-PREPARATION TECHNIQUE TO ADVANCED POLYMER TYPES, SUCH AS POLYIMIDES, POLYPHENYLENE SULFIDE, AND POLYETHER-ETHERKETONE, THAT HAVE HIGHER INTRINSIC RESISTANCE TO RADIATION DEGRADATION BUT REQUIRE MORE SOPHISTICATED PROCESSING TECHNIQUES. DURING PHASE I IT IS PLANNED TO FOCUS ON CONDENSATION-TYPE AND ADDITIVE-TYPE POLYIMIDES AND TO DEMONSTRATE THAT HIGH-QUALITY SPECIMENS REINFORCED WITH GRAPHITE AND ALUMINUM OXIDE FIBERS AS WELL AS GLASS CAN BE PRODUCED WITH SUCH RESINS AND EFFICIENTLY TESTED AT CRYOGENIC TEMPERATURES.",

THESE MATERIALS DEPEND ON UTILIZING THE INTENSE THERMAL AND RADIATION FLUX OF THE FUSION ENVIRONMENT AS A MEANS OF PRODUCING A LOW-Z COATING THAT MINIMIZES PLASMA CONTAMINATION AND SELF-SPUTTERING AND AT THE SAME TIME IS RESISTANT TO LIGHT ION SPUTTERING. TERNARY COMPOSITE MATERIALS CONTAINING A REFRACTORY METAL, A GOOD THERMAL CONDUCTOR, AND AN ALKALI METAL ARE CAPABLE OFPROVIDING GOOD MELT-LAYER STABILITY AND BETTER SPUTTERING PROPERTIES THAN THOSE OBTAINABLE WITH ELEMENTAL MATERIALS OR ALLOYS.",

IT IS ALSO ESSENTIAL IN ASSESSING PROGNOSIS AND CHOOSING THE APPROPRIATE FORM OF THERAPY FOR INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS. VISUAL INTERPRETATION OF THE CORONARY ARTERIOGRAMIS THE STANDARD FOR DEFINING THE PATHOANATOMY IN CORONARY HEART DISEASE. HOWEVER, THERE ARE INHERENT LIMITATIONS IN THIS METHOD OF INTERPRETATION. TYPICALLY, THE OBSERVER WILLDERIVE AN ESTIMATE OF THE PERCENT OF VESSEL DIAMETER NARROW-ING BY LOOKING AT AND AVERAGING TWO VIEWS TAKEN AT RIGHT ANGLES TO EACH OTHER. A SIGNIFICANT ERROR OF ESTIMATING LUMEN-SIZE MAY RESULT WHEN AN ATHEROSCLEROTIC PLAQUE IS NOT PERFECTLY ROUND OR CONCENTRICALLY LOCATED WITHIN THE LUMEN; IN FACT, THE MAJORITY OF LESIONS ARE ECCENTRIC AND MANY HAVEIRREGULAR SHAPES. THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP AN IMPROVED, OBJECTIVE METHOD FOR THREE-DIMENSIONAL RECONSTRUCTION OF CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHIC DATA. THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED BY APPLY-ING REFINEMENTS OF A NOVEL ALGORITHM TO ALREADY DEVELOPED COMPUTERIZED DENSITOMETRIC TECHNIQUES. THE ALGORITHM MAY READILY BE APPLIED TO A LARGE NUMBER OF IMAGE FRAMES. THE GOAL OF THE EFFORT IS TO DEVELOP A REAL-TIME ALGORITHM FOR ANGIOGRAPHIC DATA, WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR RELIABLE DECISIONS FOR CHOOSING THERAPY AND IMMEDIATE DECISIONS WHILE DOING BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY. THE ALGORITHM IS ALSO EXPECTED TO HAVEWIDESPREAD APPLICATIONS IN INDUSTRY.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         ADVANCED GENETIC SCIENCES, INC. IS DEVELOPING A GENERAL METHOD FOR PRODUCING HYBRID SEED WHICH REMOVES THE PRIMARY BARRIER TO THE USE OF NUCLEAR MALE STERILE GENES. THESE GENES GIVE RISE TO MALE STERILITY ONLY WHEN THE PLANT IS HOMOZYGOUS FOR THE RECESSIVE MALE STERILITY ALLELE. AS A RESULT, MALE STERILE PLANTS MUST BE PROPAGATED BY BACKCROSSING TO MALE FERTILES, YIELDING A MIXED POPULATION OF FERTILES AND STERILES. THUS, PURE STANDS OF MALE STERILE PLANTS CANNOT BE OBTAINED WITHOUT PRECISE AND EXPENSIVE PROCEDURES FOR ROGUEING OUT THE MALE FERTILE SEGREGANTS. THEIR SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM IS TO CREATE LINKAGE BETWEEN A MALE STERILE GENE AND A MARKER GENE BY INTRODUCING THE MARKER GENE TO PLANT CHROMOSOMES BY GENETIC TRANSFORMATION. FROM AMONG MANY PLANTS INDEPENDENTLY TRANSFORMED WITH A SUITABLE MARKER GENE, THEY WILL SELECT (BY TEST-CROSSING) A LINKAGE SUFFICIENT FOR HYBRID SEED PRODUCTION. THE MOST SUITABLE MARKER IS SEED COLOR, BECAUSE COLORED SEEDS CAN BE SORTED ELECTRONICALLY BEFORE PLANTING. TO THIS END, A BACTERIAL GENE WILL BE ENGINEERED THAT DETERMINES INDIGO SYNTHESIS SO THAT IT CAN BE EXPRESSED IN PLANT CELLS. THE METHOD OFFERS CLEAR ADVANTAGES OVER CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGIES, WHOSE LIMITATIONS RESULT IN HIGH COSTS AND/OR LOW PURITY OF HYBRID SEED IN MANY CROP PLANTS.",

WE PROPOSE TO INTERCALATE SINGLE CRYSTALS OF ZRS(2) AND HFS(2) WITH LII. UNDER THE APPLICATION OF AN EXTERNALLYAPPLIED CURRENT PULSE, THE LII WILL UNDERGO A REDUCTION/OXIDATION REACTION THAT CONTRIBUTES A FREE-ELECTRON TO THE CONDUCTION BAND OF THE HOST CRYSTAL. THE PROPOSED DEVICES WOULD HAVE A VARIABLE FREEELECTRON DENSITY THAT COULD BE CONTROLLED BETWEEN <10(16) TO 10(22) -E/CUBIC CENTIMETERS. THE LARGE VARIATION OF FREE-ELECTRON DENSITY ALLOWS THE WAVELENGTH AND DEGREE OF SPECULAR REFLECTANCE TO BE MODULATED. OPTICAL SWITCHING WOULD BE ACHIEVED IN A 3-LAYER DEVICE COMPRISED OF THE OPTICALLY ACTIVE ELEMENT (ZRS(2)/LII OR HFS(2)/LII AND TWO TRANSPARENT ELECTRODES. A MODEST CURRENT PULSE (<200 MA/SQUARE CENTIMETERS) WOULD BE USED TO SWITCH THE DEVICE FROM TRANSMITTING TO REFLECTING. BY HAVING THE LII REDUCTION/OXIDATION CENTERS HOMOGENEOUSLY DISTRIBUTED IN THE VAN DER WALLS' GAPS OF THE ZRS(2)/LII AND HFS(2)/LII CRYSTLS, THE OPTICAL SWITCHING SHOULD BE EXTREMELY RAPID. THE GOAL OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP OPTICAL HARDENING DEVICES THAT UNDERGO REVERSIBLE TRANSMISSIVE TO REFLECTIVE SWITCHING IN <10 TO THE MINUS SIX POWER SECONDS.",

THE NEW APPROACH IS BASED ON THE DEVELOPMENTOF A MORE ENERGETIC CATHODE MATERIAL WHICH OPERATES BY THE TOPOCHEMICAL INSERTION MECHANISM OF LITHIUM IONS DURING THE DISCHARGE PROCESS. IN THIS APPROACH, A SPECIALLY PREPARED AMORPHOUS TRISULFIDE WOULD BE USED ALONE OR WITH AN ADDITIONOF TIS2, AS A HIGH ENERGY CATHODE MATERIAL. THIS APPROACH APPEARS VERY PROMISING FOR REACHING EVEN HIGHER RATE CAPABILITIES WITH GOOD RECHARGEABILITY. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE NEW APPROACH COULD PROVIDE RECHARGEABLE LITHIUM BATTERIES WITH PRACTICAL ENERGY DENSITIES IN THE RANGE OF 98-143 WH/KG COMPARED TO ONLY 24-33 WH/KG FOR THE PRESENT NICKEL-CADMIUM CELLS, A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT.

MOREOVER, A FLUIDIZED BED CAN PROVIDE THE LONG GAS-PHASE RESIDENCE TIME REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE HIGH DESTRUCTION EFFICIENCY OF ORGANICS. EXPERIMENTAL TESTING IN A BENCH-SCALE HYBRID FLUIDIZED BED INCINERATOR WILL ESTABLISH THE DEGREE OF ORGANICS DESTRUCTION AND METALS REMOVAL THAT CAN BE ACHIEVED AND THE SENSITIVITY OF THESE PERFORMANCE INDICES TO OPERATING CONDITIONS.",

THE IMPROVEMENTS WILL LOWER COSTS IN TRADITIONAL ABSORPTION CYCLE MARKETS, EG. AIR COOLED ABSORPTION AIR CONDITIONERS. THE NEW PROPERTY OF HIGHER LIFT FROM AMBIENT TEMPERATURES WILL ALSO PROVIDE NEW OPPORTUNITIES NOT PREVIOUSLY ACCESSIBLE TO LOW COST WATER BASED ABSORPTION HEAT PUMPS. FOR EXAMPLE, APPLYING ABSORPTION HEAT PUMPING TO COMMERCIAL HOT WATER HEATERS CAN SAVE 58 X 10(12) BTU ANNUALLY. THE RESEARCH WILL PREDICT AND MEASURE THE SOLUTION THERMODYNAMIC EFFECTS OF ADDING ADDITIONAL IONIC SPECIES (BOTH CATIONS AND ANIONS) TO THE NAOH SOLUTION.

CONVENTIONAL METEOROLOGICAL DATA (I.E., SURFACE TOWER NETWORK, ONCE OR TWICE DAILY RAWINSONDE RELEASES, AND SYNOPTIC SURFACE DATA) ARE NOT ADEQUATE TO FULLY DESCRIBE THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL DETAILS OF LAND/SEA BREEZES. BECAUSE OF THESE UNIQUE FLOW PATTERNS, NASA HAS A GREAT NEED FOR DETAILED METEOROLOGICAL DATA AND ANALYSES OF THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE PLANETARYBOUNDARY LAYER AT KSC IN ORDER TO REDUCE WEATHER INTERFERENCES ON SOME OF ITS CRITICAL OPERATIONS. A PROPOSED PHASED PROJECT, KABLE (KENNEDY SPACE CENTER ATMOSPHERIC BOUNDARY LAYER EXPERIMENT), WILL PROVIDE NASA WITH A COST EFFECTIVE, INNOVATIVE SOLUTION TO MANY OF THEIR SHORT-RANGE FORECASTING PROBLEMS. THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDENASA WITH A CLIMATOLOGICAL DATA BASE OF THE PLANETARY BOUNDARY LAYER IN THE KSC/CAPE CANAVERAL REGION, DATA TO EVALUATE THE SEA BREEZE MODULES IN VARIOUS MODELS USED OPERATIONALLY AT KSC, AND ADDITONAL PERMANENT METEOROLOGICALINSTRUMENTATION USEFUL FOR OPERATIONAL SHORT-RANGE WEATHER FORECASTING.",

IN PHASEI, OPTIMAL CONDITIONS WILL BE DETERMINED FOR LINKER ARM COUPLING AND FOR ATTACHMENT OF SEVERAL REPORTER MOLECULES (BIOTIN, TEXAS RED, FLUORESCEIN) TO THE MONONUCLEOTIDE 2'- DEOXYCYTIDYLIC ACID.

THIS RESULTS IN AN EXTREME REDUCTION OF THE AMPLIFIED SPONTANEOUS EMISSION, SINGLE MODE OPERATION OF THESYSTEM AND GREAT STABILITY IN THE FREQUENCY OUTPUT. THE GRAZING INCIDENCE DESIGN OF THE GRATING ELIMINATES THE NEED OF INTERACAVITY BEAM EXPANDING OPTICS, YET PROVING HIGH RESOLUTION AND SPECTRALLY NARROW LINEWIDTH (150 MHZ) OVER THE ENTIRE TUNING RANGE OF THE DYE. THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF OPTICAL ELEMENTS USED NOT ONLY REDUCES THE UNDESIRABLE REFLECTION LOSSES BUT ALSO MAKES THE UNIT LESS SENSITIVE TO TEMPERATURE CHANGE, LESS VULNERABLE TO HIGH POWER BEAM, AND EXTREMELY EASY TO ALIGN. MOREOVER, USING THE MIRROR (NOT THE GRATING) AS A TUNING ELEMENT, ENSURES THAT THE MODE NUMBER AND LINEWIDTH ARE PRECISELY PRESERVED DURING THE SCANNING PROCESS.",

THE SENSITIVITY OF THE PIEZO-ELECTRIC CRYSTAL INCREASES WITH THE SQUARE OF ITS FREQUENCY. THE CONVENTIONAL CRYSTAL WHICH IS DRIVEN IN BULK VIBRATION HAS A PRACTICAL LIMIT OF ABOUT 10 MHZ IN FUNDAMENTAL FREQUENCY, BECAUSE HIGHER FREQUENCY REQUIRES THINNER CRYSTAL, WHICH IS MECHANICAL TOO FRAGILE. IN THE SAW CRYSTAL THE VIBRATION TAKES PLACE ALONG THE SURFACE, AND CAN BE MADE TO REACH 100 MHZ WITHOUT THE PROBLEM OF STRUCTURAL FRAGILITY. THE INCREASED SENSITIVITY WOULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO MEASURE VERY FINE PARTICLES (LESS THAN ABOUT 0.1 M) AND TO MEASURE TRACE GASES BY USING CHEMICALLY REACTIVE COATINGS ON THE CRYSTAL.

AN AWJ IS A SMALL DIAMETER ULTRA HIGH VELOCITY WATERJET INTO WHICH ABRASIVE PARTICLES ARE ENTRAINED. WATERPRESSURES UP TO 60,000 PSI ARE USED TO ACCELERATE THE PARTICLES. THE AWJ TECHNIQUE IS IN DAILY USE IN MANY INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS. IT HAS SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL FOR ADAPTION TO MEET THESE NUCLEAR INDUSTRY NEEDS AND IS ESPECIALLY ADAPTABLE TO REMOTE AND ROBOTIC OPERATIONS. THE PROGRAM WILL FIRST DEFINE THE METAL SURFACE REMOVAL AND UNDERWATER CUTTING NEEDS OF THE NUCLEAR INDUSTRY. PARAMETRIC TESTS WITH EMPHASIS ON OPTIMIZATION FOR SYSTEM PERFORMANCE WILL BE CONDUCTED FOR BOTH APPLICATIONS. THE DATA GENERATED BY THE PROGRAM WILL BE COMBINED WITH EXISTINGINFORMATION TO DEVELOP CONCEPTUAL SYSTEM DESIGNS. EASE OF USE, DEPENDABILITY, AND SPOILS CONTAINMENT AND REMOVAL WILL BE EMPHASIZED IN THE DESIGN EFFORT. AN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE SYSTEMS WILL BE DONE.

THE RELEVANT TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRARION PROPOSED UNDER PHASE I WILL BE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A VOLTAGE SENSOR WHICH WILL HAVE A DYNAMIC RANGE GREATER THAN 40 DB AND AN AC MEASUREMENT BANDWIDTH CAPABILITY GREATER THAN A GHZ. A NOVEL POLARIMETRIC OUTPUT DETECTION SCHEME IS ALSO PROPOSED WHICH PRODUCES A SENSOR OUTPUT THAT IS INSENSITIVE TO SOURCE LIGHT INTENSITY VARIATIONS, MICROBENDING LOSSES, RADIATION DARKENING OF THE OPTICAL FIBERS, AND SCINTILLATION OR OTHER LIGHT-PRODUCING EVENTS. THE PROPOSED PHASE I EFFORT WILL FOCUS ON: RELEVANT TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT AND FABRICATION OF PROTOTYPE VOLTAGE SENSORS; PERFORMANCE EVALUATION AT THE SPONSOR'S LABORATORY (ETDL); AND CLOSE COORDINATION WITH RELATED TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS AT THE NATIONAL BUREAU OF STANDARDS.",

THIS NEW CALORIMETER (GAS ENERGY METER) WILL BE DESIGNED TO BE A PROTOTYPE FOR DEVELOPMENT OF AN INSTRUMENT SUITABLE FOR REMOTE INSTALLATION, AS ACCURATE AS PRESENT LABORATORY CALORIMETERS, OPERABLE CONTINUOUSLY FOR PRECISE ACCOUNTING AT CUSTODY TRANSFER POINTS, AND LOW IN COST. PRESENTLY THERE ARE NO EXISTING INSTRUMENTS CAPABLE OF MAKING REAL-TIME AND CONTINUOUS BTU MEASUREMENTS IN A HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT AT REMOTE SITES. THIS PROJECT ADDRESSES A VERY REAL AND SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM FOR THE GAS INDUSTRY AND ALL CONSUMERS OF NATURAL GAS. THE NEED FOR A LOW COST FIELD-DEPLOYABLE GAS ENERGY METER HAS DEVELOPED FROM THE SHIFT OF GAS BILLING FROM A VOLUME TO AN ENERGY BASIS AND MORE RECENTLY BY THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION'S RULING THAT GAS PIPELINES SHOULD BE REGULATED AS COMMON CARRIERS. THE PROGRAM OBJECTIVE IS TO PRODUCE A LABORATORY PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENT THAT WILL DEMONSTRATE THE ADVANTAGES OF THE ENERGY METER DESIGN. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS OBJECTIVE THE FOLLOWING FIVE TASKS WILL BE COMPLETED: (1) DEVELOP A CATALYTIC COMBUSTION REACTOR, (2) DESIGN A GAS CALORIMETER FLOW CELL EMPLOYING THE CATALYTIC REACTOR, (3) DESIGN A MICROPROCESSOR CONTROL AND DATA COLLECTION SYSTEM FOR THE CALORIMETER, (4) TEST THE COMPLETE GAS CALORIMETER SYSTEM AND DEVELOP APPROPRIATE OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES, AND (5) CONSTRUCT A PROTOTYPE GAS CALORIMETER FOR TESTING.",

THE BASIC GAGE HAS DEMONSTRATED ABILITY TO MEASURE STATIC STRAINS ACCURATELY AT TEMPERATURESUP TO 1500 DEGREE FAHRENHEIT. THIS LIMITATION OF 1500 DEGREE FAHRENHEIT IS DUE TO ELECTRICAL LEAKAGE IN THE INSULATORS AND CABLE. THE GAGE ITSELF IS STABILIZED AT 2000 DEGREE FAHRENHEIT DURING MANUFACTURING, AND COULD OPERATE AT LEAST FOR A SHORT TIME AT THIS TEMPERATURE. MORE RECENT MODIFICATIONS TO THE SIGNAL CONDITIONING 2 INCREASE THE INSTRUMENTS CAPACITY TO TOLERATE MORE SEVERE ELECTRICAL LEAKAGE. WITH THIS IMPROVEMENT COMBINED WITH BETTER INSULATION, THE GAGE SHOULD OPERATE WELL ABOVE 2000 DEGREE FAHRENHEIT USING CURRENT TECHNOLOGY. THE FIRST PHASE OF THE PROJECT WOULD STUDY METHODS OF IMPROVING GAGE COMPONENTS SUCH AS IMPROVED FLESURE DESIGNS, POSSIBLE USE OF CERAMIC BEARINGS IN PLACE OF FLEXURES, AND AN OVERALL MINIATURIZATION OF THE GAGE. THE USE OF CERAMIC COMPONENTS SUCH AS ALUMINA, SILICON CARBIDE, AND SILICON NITRIDE WITH SPUTTERED INSULATION AND SPUTTERED THIN FILM CAPACITOR PLATE COULD SUBSTAINTIALLY INCREASE RUGGEDNESS AND PROVIDE MINIATURIZATION. THE END RESULT OF PHASE II WOULD BE A MINIATURE, RUGGED DIFFERENTIAL CAPACITIVE STRAIN GAGE WHICH COULD MEASURE LARGE OR SMALL STRAINS AT TEMPERATURES WELL ABOVE 2000 DEGREE FAHRENHEIT. THE GAGE WOULD BE INSENSITIVE TO SHOCK LOADS OR MECHANICAL VIBRATIONS AND LESS EXPENSIVE THAN PRESENT MODELS. ITS PRIMARY USE WOULD BE TO MEASURE STRAIN ON ADVANCED AEROSPACE STRUCTURES, TURBOJET AND RAM JET ENGINE COMPONENTS. IT WOULD ALSO HAVE LIMITED APPLICATIONS ON NUCLEAR AND CONVENTIONAL POWER PLANT COMPONENTS, REFINERIES, ADVANCED AUTOMOTIVE GAS AND DIESEL ENGINES AND IN MATERIAL TESTING APPLICATIONS.",

(IST) PROPOSES TO DEVELOP A THERMOLUMINESCENCE DOSIMETRY (TLD) SYSTEM FOR MEASUREMENT OF ABSORBED DOSE DISTRIBUTIONS OF IONIZING RADIATION (GAMMAS, BETAS, NEUTRONS) IN PHANTOMS. THE SYSTEMWILL EMPLOY IST-DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY FOR LASER HEATING AND FABRICATION OF SUITABLE LARGE-AREA, THIN-FILM DOSIMETER ARRAYS. COMMERCIAL THERMOLUMINESCENCE (TL) PHOSPHORS (E.G., MAGNESIUM BORATE) WILL BE USED WITH A PRINTING TECHNIQUE FOR PRODUCING VARIOUS SPOT SIZES AND THICKNESSES ON THIN GLASS OR HIGH-TEMPERATURE POLYMER-SUBSTRATE SHEETS. NEUTRON DOSES CAN BE MEASURED USING PROTON RADIATORS AND PROTON ABSORBERS ON ALTERNATE SPOTS, OR USING A TL PHOSPHOR MADE WITH DIFFERENT ISOTOPES AT ALTERNATE LOCATIONS, FOR GAMMA-NEUTRON DISCRIMINATION. THE TLD SYSTEM WILL BE BASED ON A HIGHLY STABLE, CLOSED-LOOP, FEEDBACK-CONTROLLED 20-WATT CO2 LASER WITH A BEAM THAT HAS A UNIFORM CROSS SECTION OF VARIABLE SIZE. THETEMPORAL SHAPE OF THE LASER HEATING PULSE WILL BE TAILORED BY COMPUTER CONTROL FOR PRE-AND POSTANNEAL TREATMENTS AND RAPID HEATING OF THESE DOSIMETERS WITH MINIMAL INCANDESCENCE BACKGROUND EMISSION. A LARGE READING AREA WILL BE OBTAINED BY THE ADDITION OF SPECIAL X-Y DOSIMETER-POSITIONING MECHANISMS. THE ADVANTAGE OF THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY OVER CONVENTIONAL PHANTOM DOSIMETRY IS THE POSSIBILITY OF PLACING A LARGE NUMBER OF VERY SMALL DOSIMETERS IN THE FORM OF ARRAYS ON SHEETS BETWEEN THE TRANSVERSE SLICES OF HUMAN PHANTOMS OR WRAPPING THEM AROUND BONELIKE OR PROSTHETIC MATERIAL INSERTED IN THESE PHANTOMS AND RAPIDLY MEASURING THE ABSORBED DOSES IN AN AUTOMATED TLD READER.",

THE SYSTEM IS A SPACE-BASED, THINNED PHASED ARRAY RADAR IN WHICH EACH ARRAY ELEMENT IS A SEPARATE SPACECRAFT (CALLED A MINI-RADAR). MINI-RADARS COOPERATE TO FORM A SINGLE COHERENT RADAR BEAM. THE NEW ARCHITECTURE DISTRIBUTES SIGNAL PROCESSING ALMOST EQUALLY THROUGHOUT THE MINI-RADARS AND ALLOWS FOR PROCESSING RECONFIGURATION IN THE EVENT OF A SINGLE (OR EVEN MULTIPLE)MINI-RADAR FAILURE OR DESTRUCTION. THE KEY IDEA IS TO DISTRIBUTE ARRAY PROCESSING AMOND THE SPACECRFT ACCORDING TO RANGE OR DOPPLER SHIFT. THIS IS DONE BY DIVIDING THE TOTAL RANGE/DOPPLER INTERVAL COVERED INTO N EQUAL RANGE/SOPPLER SUBINTERVALS AND ASSIGNING EACH SUBINTERVAL TO ONE OF THE MINI-RADARS FOR PROCESSING. IN OTHER WORDS,EACH MINI-RADAR BECOMES THE CENTRAL PROCESSOR OR \"MASTER\" FOR A PARTICULIAR GROUP OF RANGE/DOPPLER BINS. RECONFIGUREABILITY OF PROCESSING IN THE EVENT OF A LOSS OF ONE OR MORE MINI-RADARS IS STRAIGHTFORWARD: DIVIDE THE TOTAL NUMER OF RANGE/DOPPLER BINS OF INTEREST EQUALLY AMONG THE SURVIVORS.

PRE-PROCESSING ON THE FOCAL PLANE TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE IS THEREFORE DESIRABLE, ALTHOUGH IT HAS BEEN LIMITED BY POWER DISSIPATION. THE POWER PROBLEM IS PARTIALLY ADDRESSED BY PERFORMING AS MANY FUNCTIONS AS POSSIBLE IN PARALLEL, WITH ANALOG ELECTRONICS BEHIND EACH DETECTOR. THERE ARE SOME FUNCTIONS THAT CAN BE READILY PERFORMED ONLY DIGITALLY, SUCH AS THRESHOLDING, LONG TERM MEMORY, AND LOGIC. HOWEVER, CURRENT ANALOG TO DIGITAL CONVERTERS (ADC) CONSUME VASTLY MORE POWER THAN CAN BE TOLERATED IN CRYOGENIC IR FPA'S. FEASIBILITY IS BEING EVALUATED OF PERFORMING ON-FOCAL PLANE ANALOG TO DIGITAL CONVERSION FOR LARGE, TWO-DIMENSIONAL IR DETECTOR ARRAYS. A PRELIMINARY ADC DESIGN IS BEING GENERATED AND COMPUTER MODELED TO VERIFY PERFORMANCE WITH INTRINSIC DETECTORS AT LIQUID NITROGEN TEMPERATURES. THE RADIATION HARDNESS OF THE DESIGN IS BEING ANALYTICALLY DEMONSTRATED. THE PRIMARY PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS OF SPEED, RESOLUTION, AND NOISE ARE BEING RELATED TO AREA AND POWER REQUIREMENTS, WHICH WOULD DETERMINE COMPATIBILITY WITH HIGH DENSITY IRARRAYS.",

CURRENT SENSOR TECHNOLOGY HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. A LIGHTWEIGHT EXO-ATMOSPHERIC PROJECTILE SEEKER APPROACH CAPABLE OF EXTRACTING, ACQUIRING AND TRACKING TARGETS IN THE PRESENCE OF HIGHLY CLUTTERED AND DYNAMIC BACKGROUNDS IS BEING INVESTIGATED. THIS APPROACH TO INFRARED IMAGING, WHICH USES A SCANNED IMAGE AND THREE-DIMENSIONAL FOCAL PLANE TECHNOLOGY TO PUT INTRAFRAME AND INTERFRAME IMAGE PROCESSING ON THE FOCAL PLANE, ALLOWS ON-FOCAL PLANE EXTRACTION OF LOW OBSERVABLES FROM EARTH CLUTTER AND NUCLEAR STRUCTURED ENVIRONMENTS. NORMAL MISSILE BODY MOTION CAN BE USED TO GENERATE THE DITHER SCAN, NEGATING THE NEED FOR SCANNING OPTICS. DATARATES AND OFF-FOCAL PLANE PROCESSING LOADS ARE REDUCED SUFFICIENTLY TOELIMINATE THEM AS MAJOR ISSUES IN THE SEEKER DESIGN. THE NATURE OF THE SAMPLING PROCESS ALSO IS EXPECTED TO CONTROL OR ELIMINATE THE EFFECTS OF GAMMA PULSE EVENTS ON THE SENSOR. THE ALGORITHM FOR INCLUSION IN AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT IS BEING ANALYTICALLY VALIDATED ANDTHE OPERATING PARAMETERS OF THE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT ARE BEING DEFINED FOR INSERTION IN FUTURE GENERATIONS OF FOCAL PLANE MODULES FOR THE EXO-ATMOSPHERIC PROJECTILE SEEKERS.",

WE PROPOSE TO OVERCOME THESE DIFFICULTIES BY (1) USING ALGAAS LAYERS GROWN BY OMCVD TO ACT AS FRONT-AND BACK-SURFACE FIELDS IN ORDER TO CONFINE THE PHOTOGENERATED MINORITY CARRIERS AWAY FROM THE SURFACES, AND (2) USING OUR CLEFT TECHNOLOGY TO PRODUCE THIN, SEPARATED FILMS OF THIS STRUCTURE. EFFICIENCIES OF THE RESULTING CONCENTRATOR CELLSSHOULD EXCEED EXISTING GAAS AND SI CELL EFFICIENCIES. OUR OBJECTIVES FOR PHASE I ARE TO DETERMINE THE OPTIMUM STRUCTURE AND TO PROPOSE THE INITIAL FABRICATION PROCESS FORPOINT-CONTACT GAAS/ALGAAS HETEROSTRUCTURE CONCENTRATOR CELLS. WE WILL DEVELOP A MODEL OF THE PROPOSED CELL, MODEL THE CELL STRUCTURE, INVESTIGATE CONDITIONS FOR FORMATION OF THE FRONT-AND BACK-SURFACE FIELDS, AND SEARCH FOR A SUITABLEMETHOD OF FORMING LOCALIZED JUNCTIONS IN THE LAYER. AT THE END OF PHASE 1 WE EXPECT TO HAVE DETERMINED THE OPTIMUM STRUCTURE AND UPPER EFFICIENCY LIMIT FOR THIS CELL, PREDICTED CONDITIONS FOR GAAS/ALGAAS INTERFACES WITH LOW INTERFACE RECOMBINATION VELOCITY, AND SELECTED ONE OR MORE METHODS OF JUNCTION FORMATION.

        "abstract": "Abstract         RESEARCH IS DIRECTED AT TECHNIQUES TO IMPROVE SURFACE MORPHOLOGY IN SILICON ON INSULATOR (SOI) WAFERS PREPARED BY ZONE MELTING RECRYSTALLIZATION (ZMR). THE THREE AREAS OF PRIMARY IMPORTANCE IN IMPROVING THE SURFACE MORPHOLOGY OF ZMR PROCESSED WAFERS ARE: SLIP, BOW AND WARP, AND SURFACE SMOOTHNESS. SLIP IS CAUSED BY THERMALLY INDUCED STRESS THAT RESULTS FROM THE TEMPERATURE GRADIENT IN THE MELT ZONE. METHODS OF REDUCING THIS PROBLEM WILL BE EXAMINED BY VARYING SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING THE SUBSTRATE TEMPERATURE, SCAN SPEED, WIRE WIDTH AND SUBSTRATE ORIENTATION. THE ABOVE PARAMETERS WILL ALSO BE VARIED TO IDENTIFY THE EFFECTS ON BOW AND WARP. IN ADDITION, BOW AND WARP MEASUREMENTS WILL BE COMPLETED BEFORE AND AFTER THE ZMR PROCESS TO IDENTIFY POSSIBLE CORRELATION WITH STARTING MATERIAL. SURFACE ROUGHNESS IN ZMR IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE QUALITY OF THE STARTING POLYSILICON LAYER. PARAMETERS AFFECTING THE POLYSILICON CVD DEPOSITION WILL BE VARIED TO OPTIMIZE THE QUALITY OF THIS LAYER AND ALTERNATIVE POLYSILICON GROWTH TECHNIQUES WILL ALSO BE STUDIED. SOI MATERIAL OFFERS MANY INHERENT ADVANTAGES OVER CONVENTIONAL SILICON BULK WAFERS: RADIATION HARDNESS, VOLTAGE ISOLATION, IMPROVED SPEED PERFORMANCE, GREATER PACKING DENSITY, AND CMOS LATCH-UP IMMUNITY. CURRENT METHODS OF FABRICATING SOI MATERIAL RESULT IN EITHER COST AND/OR QUALITY PROBLEMS. THE ZMR PROCESS OFFERS AN ALTERNATIVE TO OTHER SOI PROCESSES.",

DUE TO THE INCREASED CARBON- DEUTERIUM BOND STRENGTH, DEUTERATED LUBRICANT OILS AND GREASES EXHIBIT SUPERIOR CAPABILITIES UNDER TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE EXTREMES COMPARED TO THE EQUIVALENT HYDROCARBONS. THE INCREASED FUNCTIONAL LIFETIMES OF THESE COMPOUNDS HAVE MADE THEM A STRATEGIC COMMODITY IN EQUIPMENT WITH A RAPID LUBRICANT FAILURE. THE HIGH COST OF CHEMICAL DEUTERATION HAS RESULTED IN A HIGH COST PRODUCT WITH ITS USE LIMITED TO EQUIPMENT WHOSE \"DOWN-TIME\" IS EITHER EXPENSIVE, OR THREATENING TO THE COUNTRY'S NATIONAL SECURITY. MANY UNICELLULAR ALGAE PRODUCE LARGE QUANTITIES OF OILS AS FOOD STORAGE COMPOUNDS AND CAN BE GROWN AUTOTROPHICALLY IN CULTURE REQUIRING ONLY LIGHT CARBON DIOXIDE WATER AND A FEW MINERALS. WE PROPOSE TO GROW THESE ALGAL SPECIES AUTOTROPHICALLY IN THE PRESENCE OF 99.7% DEUTERIUM OXIDE (D2O), THEREBY REPLACING ALL THE CELLULAR HYDROGEN WITH DEUTERIUM AND BILOGICALLY PRODUCING PERDEUTERATED HYDROCARBONS. OUR PROGRAM OBJECTIVES ARE FOURFOLD: DEFINE OPTIMAL CULTURE CONDITIONS AND SELECT STRAINS OF OIL-PRODUCING ALGAE WHICH EXHIBIT EXCEPTIONAL GROWTH IN 99.7% D2O. IDENTIFY PROCEDURES FOR EFFICIENT HARVEST OF THE CULTURES, EXTRACTION OF THE PERDEUTERATED OILS AND RECYCLING OF THE D2O. CHARACTERIZE THE LIPID COMPONENTS PRODUCED BY THE PIL-PRODUCING ALGAE DURING CULTURE IN D2O. DESIGN A TEST BED FOR COMPARISON OF THE LUBRICATION CAPABILITIES OF THE OILS EXTRACTED FROM THE ALGAE.

THE PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE USES A HIGH-PERFORMANCE MILITARY STANDARD SINGLE-CHIP MICROPROCESSOR AS A SYSTEM CONTROLLER. WHEREAS EXISTING SYSTEMS USE SPECIAL-PURPOSE HARDWARE DEDICATED TO SIGNAL PROCESSING FUNCTIONS, IN THE PROPOSED APPROACH THIS HARDWARE IS REPLACED BY SOFTWARE WHICH EMBODIED STANDARD DSP ALGORITHMS. THIS APPROACH ALLOWS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A RECONFIGURABLE UDAS WHICH MAY BE TAILORED TO APPLICATION-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS SIMPLY BY CHANGING THE CONTROLLER SOFTWARE. THE PROPOSED DSP ARCHITECTURE IS BASED ON A DESIGN PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED BY MIKROS FOR USE AS THE CONTROLLER OF A US NAVY LINK-11 DATA TERMINAL. SINCE THE LINK-11 NETWORK USES 16 AUDIO TONES TO MODULATE AN RF CARRIER, IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT A SIMILAR CONTROLLER DESIGN CAN BE USED TO PROVIDE A GENERAL-PURPOSE UDAS. THE PROPOSED PROGRAM WILL DEFINE THE APPLICATION INTERFACES AND ALGORITHMS, INVESTIGATE THE APPLICABILITY OF THE EXISTING DESIGN, ASSESS PACKAGING AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS, AND PRESENT A PRELIMINARY DESIGN OF A COMPACT LOW-POWER RECONFIGURABLE UDAS.",

THIS DEVICE PROMISES TO BE A HIGHLY EFFICIENT, COMPACT SOURCE IN THE 1- TO 10-GHZ RANGE, AND ALTERNATE CONFIGURATIONS THAT EXTEND THE OPERATION TO HIGHER FREQUENCIES ARE POSSIBLE. LINEAR THEORY PREDICTS VERY HIGH GROWTH RATES AND STRONG ELECTRON BUNCHING IN THE DEVICE, WHICH IS SIMILAR TO A CONVENTIONAL TWO-CAVITY KLYSTRON BUT WITH A CURVED DRIFT SPACE. ENHANCED BUNCHING CAUSED BY THE NEGATIVE MASS INSTABILITY OCCURS IN THE DRIFT REGION. AN INITIAL NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF THE DEVICE, WHICH EXHIBITS AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE FASTER BUNCHING THAN COULD BE ACHIEVED IN A LINEAR SYSTEM, HAS BEEN PERFORMED. WITH THE ELECTRON BEAM PARAMETERS CHOSEN (1 MEV, 2 KA), A TWO-CAVITY CIK SHOULD BE CAPABLE OF GW-LEVEL OPERATION AT AN EFFICIENCY OF 50%. IF THE OUTPUT CAVITY IS REPLACED WITH A QUASI-OPTICAL OPEN RESONATOR, THE DEVICE COULD POSSIBLY BE OPERATED AT SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTER WAVELENGTHS.",

INDIVIDUALS WITH THESE DISEASES PRODUCE ANTIBODIES TO VIRAL EARLY ANTIGENS, CAPSID ANTIGENS, AND NUCLEAR ANTIGENS. THE IMMUNE RESPONSE TO EBV ANTIGENS HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR FOR CLINICAL EVALUATION AND TREATMENT. HOWEVER, CURRENT IMMUNE ASSAYS LACK SENSITIVITY AND SELECTIVITY, REQUIRE EXPERT INTERPRETATION, AND ARE NOT AMENABLE TO LARGE-SCALE CLINICAL STUDIES. OUR GOAL IS TO IMPROVE THE CLINICAL DIAGNOSTICS FOR EBV-RELATED DISEASES. GENES FOR EBV ANTIGENS WERE CLONED INTO A HIGH EXPRESSION PLASMID AND THE CORRESPONDING EBV POLYPEPTIDES WERE SYNTHESIZED IN BACTERIA, PURIFIED, AND USED TO DEVELOP SENSITIVE ENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAYS (ELISA) IN THE PROPOSED RESEARCH, THESE ELISA METHODS WILL BE USED TO MEASURE CLASS-SPECIFIC (IGG, IGA, IGM) ANTIBODY TITERS TO EBV ANTIGENS IN NORMAL INDIVIDUALS AND IN PATIENTS WITH ACUTE AND CHRONIC MONONUCLEOSIS, BURKITT'S LYMPHOMA, NASOPHARYNGEAL CARCINOMA, AND RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. THE SPECIFIC ANTIBODY LEVELS WILL BE CORRELATED WITH CLINICAL DATA TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF THE ELISA MEASUREMENTS AS PROGNOSTIC INDICATORS. IN THE INITIAL STUDIES OF PHASE I, THE ANALYSIS WILL BE LIMITED TO SAMPLES FROM SERUM BANKS.

THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL OVERCOME THIS PROBLEM BY MERGING MICROPROCESSOR AND SENSOR TECHNOLOGIES FOR LOW-COST YET HIGHLY ACCURATE ETHANOL MEASUREMENT. THIS PHASE I RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES FEASIBILITYOF THE TECHNIQUE FOR SELECTIVE ALCOHOL MEASUREMENT BY: (1) CHARACTERIZING THE RESPONSES OF PRESENTLY AVAILABLE SEMI- CONDUCTOR SENSORS TO ETHANOL, HUMIDITY, AND REPRESENTATIVE INTERFERENCES; (2) DEVELOPING COMPUTER SOFTWARE TO DECON- VOLVE THESE RESPONSES TO SELECTIVELY MEASURE ETHANOL; AND (3) DETERMINING THE TECHNIQUE'S ROBUSTNESS WITH RESPECT TO THE INTERFERENCES.

ATTEMPTS TO EMULATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE EYE WITH CCD CAMERAS AND MASSIVE COMPUTING EFFORTS HAVE NOT BEEN TOO SUCCESSFUL. LASER RANGING/SCANNING SYSTEMS ALSO HAVE THEIR LIMITATIONS IN THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY MECHANICALLY SCANNED, LOW RESOLUTION AND REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF PROCESSING TO PRODUCE AN IMAGE. THE OBJECT OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY OF MERGING THE DATA FROM A CCD CAMERA OR A FOCAL PLANE PROCESSOR WITH THE RANGE AND REFLECTANCE DATA FROM A LASER RANGER. PHASE I WILL CONSIST OF DEVELOPING THE ALGORITHMS AND EXPERT RULES FOR FUSING LASER AND CAMERA DATA AND DEMONSTRATING WITH A COMPUTER SIMULATION.

THE EMPLOYMENT OF THE GANTRY ROBOT AS THE ROBOTIC VEHICLE PERMITS A SHARPER FOCUS ON THE SPECIFIC PROBLEM BEING ADDRESSED, WHILE MAINTAINING APPLICABILITY TO A BROAD RANGE OF ROBOTIC VEHICLES. PORTIONS OF A NUCLEAR POWER FACILITY WILL BE MODELED IN THE TERRAIN TESTBED TO TEST THE NAVIGATION ALGORITHM. WALLS AND OBSTRUCTIONS SUCH AS PIPES AND MACHINERY WILL BE REPRESENTED USING LIGHTWEIGHT, INEXPENSIVE MATERIALS TO ALLOW MODEL RECONFIGURATION FOR MORE COMPREHENSIVE TESTING.

WHEN THE ELEMENTS TO BE INTERCONNECTED ARE SPACED BY DISTANCES OF MORE THAN A VERY FEW METERS, THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES TO THE USE OF OPTICS FOR PROVIDING THE INTERCONNECTS. THE FEASIBILITY IS BEING EXAMINED OF USING OPTICAL BUS EXTENDERS IN A STRATEGIC DEFENSE SYSTEM. THE ADVANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS OF BOTH FREE-SPACE COMMUNICATION AND FIBER COMMUNICATION OVER SHORT DISTANCES ARE BEING DETERMINED. CRITICAL ISSUES ARE THE BULK AND COST OF COMPONENTS, AND THE EFFICIENCY WITH WHICH LIGHT CAN BE DETECTED AT THEEND OF THE VARIOUS LINKS. OPTIMIZATION OF CERTAIN PARAMETERS OF THE EXTENDER ARE BEING EXPLORED WITH RESPECT TO BOTH COST AND PERFORMANCE.THE GENERAL RESULTS OBTAINED ARE BEING APPLIED TO THE SPECIAL CASE OF THE VME BUS. PROTOCOLS TO CONTROL ACTIVITY ON THE EXTENDER ARE BEING CONSIDERED AND A PREFERRED SOLUTION IS BEING PROPOSED. AS ISSUES ARISE THAT CAN BE RESOLVED ONLY BY BREADBOARDING A COLLECTION OF COMPONENTS OR A SMALL SUBSYSTEM, THEN SUCH BREADBOARDING IS BEING UNDERTAKEN. THE PROBLEM OF SIMULTANEOUSLY MAPPING THE STATE OF THE BUS TO SEVERAL REMOTE LOCATIONS IS BEING EXAMINED. VARIOUS METHODS FOR TAPPING THE OPTICAL ENERGY FOR MULTIPLE DESTINATIONS ARE BEING CONSIDERED AND THE OPTICAL EFFICIENCY AND COST OF THESE SOLUTIONS ARE BEING DETERMINED.",

THE TREND IN FIBER OPTICS IS CLEARLY TOWARDS THE SINGLE-MODE TYPE VERSUS THE MULTIMODE TYPE.

A ROTARY JOINT FOR 50 MICRON CORE MULTIMODE FIBERS HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED. THIS MULTIMODE DESIGN CONSISTS OF A PAIR OF GRADIENT INDEX ROD LENSES MOUNTED SO THAT THE PLANE OF ROTATION OCCURS BETWEEN THE LENSES. THE MAJOR PROBLEM THAT ARISES IN ADAPTING THIS DESIGN FOR SINGLE-MODE FIBERS IS THE ALIGNMENT AND FIXING IN PLACE OF THE FIBER WITH RESPECT TO THE LENS. OPTOMEC SEES AN OPPORTUNITY HERE TO APPLY ITS EXPERIENCE IN THE DESIGN OF FIBER OPTIC FUSION SPLICERS, TO DEVELOP HARDWARE AND TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD BE USED TO FUSE THE SINGLE-MODE FIBER ONTO THE LENS, WHICH WOULD ASSURE THAT THE ALIGNED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FIBER AND THE LENS IS RETAINED.

ENTRAINED LIQUID DROPLETS CAUSE RAPID EROSION OF THE TURBINE BLADES AND REDUCE THE SYSTEM'S RELIABILITY. A POROUS METAL BARRIER IS USED AS A VAPOR-LIQUID SEPARATOR. THE BASIC CONCEPT IS THAT THE LIQUID IMPINGING ON A POROUS METAL SURFACE CAN FLOW THROUGH IT TO A LOWER PRESSURE REGIME WHEREAS VAPOR FLOW IS RESTRICTED BECAUSE OF CAPILLARY FORCES. WHEN THE LOWER PRESSURE SIDE OF THE POROUS SURFACE IS COUPLED TO A JET PUMP, SO DESIGNED THAT IT CAN RECIRCULATE THE LIQUID FLOW, THEN A COMPACT AND RELIABLE VAPOR-LIQUID SEPARATOR HAVING NO MOVING PARTS IS AVAILABLE TO THE RANKINE CYCLE SPACE POWER SOURCE. PHASE I OF THIS RESEARCH IS DEVOTED TO EXAMINING SPECIFIC DESIGN CONCEPTS USING A VARIETY OF POROUS MATERIALS, GEOMETRIES, AND WORKING FLUIDS. BOTH THE DIRECT-CYCLE POTASSIUM-COOLED REACTOR SYSTEM AND THE LITHIUM-POTASSIUM REACTOR SYSTEM WILL BE EXAMINED. THE POROUS BARRIER LOCATION MAY BE AT VARIOUS LOCATIONS OR COMBINATIONS THEREOF, INCLUDING THE BOILER OUTLET, PIPING SECTIONS, OR SPECIFIC LOCATIONS IN THE TURBINE. EXPERIMENTAL DATA FROM GASEOUS DIFFUSION BARRIER TECHNOLOGY AND FROM LOW-GRAVITY (AIRCRAFT FLIGHT) TESTS OF THE MEDIUM POWER REACTOR EXPERIMENT (MPRE) WILL BE USED. VIABLE MATERIALS AND GEOMETRIES WILL BE ASSEMBLED AND TESTED DURING PHASE II USING WATER-STEAM MIXTURES.

METALLIC NUCLEAR FUEL IN THE SHAPE OF LONG, THIN RODS IS THE FUEL USED BY THEINTEGRAL FAST REACTOR. THE METALLIC NUCLEAR FUEL RODS ARE PRESENTLY FABRICATED IN A BATCH-CASTING PROCESS THAT UTILIZES QUARTZ TUBES OF PRECISE DIMENSIONS AS MOLDS. IN THIS PROCESS, MOLTEN FUEL IS INJECTED INTO THE QUARTZ TUBES AND ALLOWED TO COOL AND SOLIDIFY. THE QUARTZ TUBES ARE THEN BROKEN TO REMOVE THE FUEL RODS. THE BATCH-CASTING PROCESS DESCRIBED ABOVE HAS SEVERAL UNDESIRABLE FEATURES THAT, THOUGH PROBLEMATIC FOR LABORATORY-SCALE OPERATIONS, MAY PROVE UNTENABLE FOR LARGE-SCALE PRODUCTION. FIRST, THE PRECISION QUARTZ MOLDS ARE DESTROYED AFTER FIRST USE AND ARE THEREFORE NOT COST EFFICIENT. ALSO, THE QUARTZ BECOMES SLIGHTLY RADIOACTIVE DURING SOLIDIFICATION; THE BROKEN MOLDS THEREFORE CONSTITUTE RADIATIVE WASTE, WHICH MUST BE SAFELY STORED OR REPROCESSED. FURTHER, BITS OF NUCLEAR FUEL MAY BE LOST WHEN BREAKING THE MOLD, MAKING IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ACCOUNT PRECISELY FOR THE WHEREABOUTSOF ALL OF THE NUCLEAR FUEL. FINALLY, THE MOLD MAY CONTAMINATE THE FUEL BY DIFFUSION, ESPECIALLY WHILE THE FUEL IS IN THE LIQUID STATE. IN THIS PROJECT IT IS PLANNED TO ASSESS, AND THEN DEVELOP IF FEASIBLE, A CONTINUOUS CASTING PROCESS THAT CAN MITIGATE OR ELIMINATE THE UNDESIRABLE FEATURES OF THE PRESENT BATCH-MOLDING METHOD OF FORMING METALLIC NUCLEAR FUEL RODS. CONTINUOUS CASTING, USED COMMONLY FOR STRUCTURAL METALS SUCH AS STEEL, ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR MOLDS, ASSOCIATED RADIOACTIVE WASTE, AND THE POTENTIAL FOR LOSS OF SOLIDIFIED MATERIAL DURING MOLD BREAKING. THE NOVEL ASPECT OF THE NEW PROCESS INVOLVES ACOUSTICALLY LEVITATING THE MOLTEN FUEL IN ITS CONTAINER ON A SQUEEZE-FILM GAS LAYER. IN THIS WAY, THE MOLTEN FUEL DOES NOT CONTACT ITS CONTAINER, AND THE POTENTIAL FOR CHEMICAL CONTAMINATION OF THE MOLTEN FUEL IS ELIMINATED.",

GLYCEROL SOLUTIONS, AS OPPOSED TO MORE VOLATILE SOLVENTS, WILL BE EXPLORED FOR HIGH MASS EMISSION STUDIES. THE ADVANTAGES OF GLYCEROL ARE LOW VAPOR PRESSURE, PERMITTING THE APPLICATION OF HIGHER ELECTRIC FIELDS BEFORE THE ONSET OF BREAKDOWN, AND HIGH VISCOSITY AT LOW TEMPERATURES. BOTH CONDITIONS ARE HIGHLY FAVORABLE FOR ENHANCING THE EMISSION OF MACROMOLECULAR IONS. THE MACROMOLECULAR ION EMISSION CHARACTERISTICS WILL BE INVESTIGATED WITH RESPECT TO SOLVENTFLOW, IONIC STRENGTH, AND SAMPLE CONCENTRATION. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT CHARGED DROPLET SUPPRESSION AND PREFERRED ION EMISSION WILL BE DEMONSTRATED BY CONTROLLING THE SOLVENTTHROUGHPUT AND VISCOSITY BY COOLING THE EHD EMITTER.

ULTRAVIOLET HOLOGRAPHIC FILTERS FABRICATED ON RECENTLY DEVELOPED MATERIALS ARE BEING PRODUCED WHICH COULD HAVE THE DESIRED BANDWIDTH AND OPTICAL DENSITY TO ENHANCE THE SURVIVAL OF SYSTEMS AND SENSORS AGAINST UV LASER THREATS. AS THE TECHNOLOGY IS SCALABLE TO DIFFERENT SIZES, IT COULD FIND APPLICATIONS RANGING FROM ENHANCING THESURVIVABILITY OF THE SENSORS TO ACTING AS HIGH EFFICIENCY HOLOGRAPHIC OPTICAL ELEMENTS FOR COMMERCIAL OPTICS.",

THE DESIGN/PROCESS CHOICES THAT THE MANUFACTURER OF FILAMENTARY COMPOSITES MUST MAKE USUALLY REQUIRE A COMPROMISE BETWEEN CURRENT DENSITY AND PIECE LENGTH. THE REQUIREMENTS FOR SUPERCONDUCTOR PERFORMANCE, FOR EXAMPLE THE HIGHLY DEFORMED MICROSTRUCTURES IN NBTI COMPOSITES OR THE VERY DIFFERENT MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THE COMPONENTS IN NB3SN COMPOSITES, PLACE STRINGENT RESTRICTIONS ON THE AREA REDUCTION PROCESS. WIRE DRAWING IS COST-EFFECTIVE BECAUSE IT CAN BE DONE SEMICONTINUOUSLY; HOWEVER, THE HIGH TENSILE FORCES INVOLVED ARE NOT IDEAL FOR PROCESSING COMPOSITES WITH WIDELY DIFFERING COMPONENTS. CONVENTIONAL EXTRUSION HOLDS THE ADVANTAGES OF LARGE AREA REDUCTION AND COMPRESSIVE FORCES, BUT IS SEVERELY LIMITED IN PIECE LENGTH, HENCE MUST BE DONE AT LARGE DIAMETERS. A HIGHLY PROMISING ALTERNATIVE APPEARS TO BE A CONTINUOUS EXTRUSION PROCESS THAT ALLOWS LARGE AREA REDUCTIONS USING COMPRESSIVE FORCES, SMALL STARTING DIAMETERS, AND UNLIMITED LENGTHS. THIS STUDY WILL EXPLORE THE FEASIBILITY OF CONTINUOUS EXTRUSION OF DISTRIBUTED SN NB3SN COMPOSITES, A DEMANDING MATERIAL TO PROCESS BECAUSE OF THE USE OF PURE TIN ALONG WITH NIOBIUM AND COPPER.

        "abstract": "Abstract         X-RAY DIAGNOSTIC INSTRUMENTS ARE CONVENIENT FOR DEFINING SUCH PLASMA PARAMETERS AS THE ELECTRON TEMPERATURE, ION TEMPERATURE, DENSITY, AND IMPURITY CONCENTRATION AS A FUNCTION OF POSITION WITHIN A MAGNETICALLY CONFINED PLASMA. THERE IS, HOWEVER, A NEED TO PROTECT THE INSTRUMENT FROM THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF THE PLASMA UNDER STUDY. SOME X-RAY DETECTORS AND DISPERSING ELEMENTS CAN BE DAMAGED OR DESTROYED BY THE RADIATION ENVIRONMENT ASSOCIATED WITH FUSION EXPERIMENTS. IN ADDITION, SENSITIVE DETECTORS CAN BE SUBJECT TO VERY HIGH BACKGROUND COUNTING RATES. MANY OF THE STANDARD X-RAY PLASMA DIAGNOSTIC INSTRUMENTS ARE UNABLE TO WITHSTAND THE RADIATION BACKGROUND OF TFTR (THE TOKAMAK FUSION TEST REACTOR), CIT (THE COMPACT IGNITION TOKAMAK), OR FUTURE FUSION REACTORS. THE SOLUTION IS TO DESIGN INSTRUMENTS IN WHICH THE SENSITIVE COMPONENTS ARE SHIELDED FROM THE FUSION ENVIRONMENT WHILE THE X-RAY FLUX IS CONVEYED TO THEM. THIS CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE USE OF X-RAY-TRANSMITTING FIBER OPTICS. X-RAY FIBER OPTICS ARE BROADBAND, COMPACT, AND HIGHLY DIRECTIONAL. IT IS THEREFORE POSSIBLE TO DESIGN DETECTORS THAT ARE INSENSITIVE TO THE HIGH RADIATION BACKGROUND. TO PROVE THE CONCEPT, THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP A RADIATION-RESISTANT DETECTOR ASSEMBLY FOR THE SOXMOS (SOFT X-RAY MONOCHROMATOR-SPECTROMETER) AT TFTR.",

VARIABLE FLOW SOLID PROPELLANT GAS GENERATORS CAN OFFER SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN PACKAGING VOLUME WHEN COMPARED WITH CONSTANT FLOW DEVICES. THE PRINCIPLE ADVANTAGE IS THAT THE FLOW RATE CAN BE ADJUSTED TO MATCH THE AVERAGE GAS FLOW, RATHER THAN THE PEAK FLOW. THERE ARE THREE TECHNIQUES BY WHICH THE FLOW RATE CAN BE MODIFIED: ACCUMULATOR EFFECT, MASS ADDITION AND FLOW RESTRICTION. THE ACCUMULATOR EFFECT IS THE RESULT OF EXPANSION OF PRESSURIZED GASES IN THE GAS GENERATOR VOLUME. THE MASS ADDITION IS BASED ON INJECTION MASS, EITHER SOLID, LIQUID OR GAS, INTO THE BURNING VOLUME. RESTRICTED FLOW IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT GAS GENERATORS WILL BURN AT A FASTER RATE AT THE ELEVATED PRESSURE INDUCED BY RESTRICTING THE EXHAUST FLOW. AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE TASK IS AN ANALYSIS OF THE FLOW REQUIREMENTS. THIS WOULD INCLUDE EFFECTIVE MODELING OF THE VARIOUS FLOW CONTROL TECHNIQUES AS WELL AS THE STABILITY OF THE FLOW CONTROL MECHANISMS. PRELIMINARY STUDIES INDICATE THAT AN APPROXIMATE 70% REDUCTION IN GAS GENERATOR VOLUME CAN BE ACHIEVED BY USING A DEMAND FLOW SYSTEM.",

THESE TECHNIQUES WILL INCORPORATE VESTIBULAR STIMULATION, TACTILE AND SENSORY INTEGRATION, AND GROSS MOTOR ACTIVITIES INTO A COMMUNICATION ACQUISITION PROGRAM. THIS IS A DEPARTURE FROM GUIDELINES CURRENTLY BEING USED IN FIVE WAYS: 1. EMPHASIS WILL BE ON THE SEQUENCING OF NECESSARY/FUNCTIONAL SKILLS RATHER THAN NORMAL/DEVELOPMENTAL SKILLS. 2. ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES WOULD BE INITIATED AT AN EARLIER AGE THAN CURRENT DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAMS. 3. TECHNIQUES ARE A SYNTHESIS OF SPEECH/LANGUAGE, OCCUPATIONAL AND PHYSICAL THERAPIES, AND EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. 4. IMPROVEMENT OF COMMUNICATION SKILLS WOULD BE POSSIBLE REGARDLESS OF THE INDIVIDUAL'S ACHIEVEMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES. 5. IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR CROSS-DISCIPLINARY USE BY THERAPISTS, EDUCATORS, AND PARENTS IN A VARIETY OF SETTINGS. WHEN COMPLETED, THESE NONTRADITIONAL TECHNIQUES FOR ALTERNATIVE COMMUNICATION WOULD BE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE TO SCHOOL SYSTEMS, INSTITUTIONS, PRIVATE PRACTICE THERAPISTS, AND PARENTS.",

AN ADDITIONAL FEATURE WILL BE AN INCREASE IN SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO OF THE AIDED SIGNAL. THE SIGNAL PROCESSING WILL BE BASED ON THE ACTUAL EARDRUM SPL, DETERMINED FROM AN ACOUSTIC FEEDBACK SIGNAL OBTAINED BY A MICROPHONE OR PROBE IN THE EAR CANAL. FOR ALL EXPECTED INPUT LEVELS, THE SPECTRUM OF THE EARDRUM SOUND PRESSURE IS CONTROLLED BY THE PROCESSOR, SO THAT THE PEAK SPL IN ANY 1/3-OCTAVE INTERVAL DOES NOT EXCEED THE INDIVIDUAL'S LOUDNESS DISCOMFORT LEVEL (LDL) WHILE STILL MAINTAINING THE DESIRED SPECTRUM AND SPL AT ITS MOST EFFECTIVE VALUE. THE PROCESSOR COMPARES THE INPUT AND OUTPUT FOR EACH FILTER AND THE GAIN IN EACH CHANNEL IS THEN ADJUSTED (ON A REAL-TIME BASIS) TO OBTAIN THE DESIRED OUTPUT FOR THE BAND. DETERMINATION OF AVERAGING TIMES FOR BOTH INPUT AND OUTPUT SIGNALS IS SIGNIFICANT AND WILL CONSTITUTE A MAJOR ELEMENT IN THE STUDY.

THE IMPACT CHARACTERISTICS OF PERCUSSIVE JETS (INITIAL IMPACTS, TENSILE FAILURE, AND PERSISTENCE) ALLOW TARGETS TO BE CUT IN WAYS NEVER BEFORE ATTEMPTED. FOR INSTANCE, AT 30,000-PSIG DISCHARGE PRESSURE, CALCULATIONS SHOW THE POSSIBILITY OF STRIKING TARGET MATERIAL WITH IMPULSES GREATER THAN THE ULTIMATE STRENGTH OF HIGH-STRENGTH STEEL, OVER 10,000 TIMES PER SECOND! PERCUSSIVE JETS APPLY FORCE TO ROCK AS A SEQUENCE OF HIGH-FREQUENCY, SHORT-DURATION IMPACTS, RATHER THAN STEADILY. THESE JETS CAN BE PRODUCED WITH A CONVENTIONAL, CONTINUOUS-FLOW SYSTEM BY MODULATING THE DISCHARGE, THAT IS, CYCLING THE DISCHARGE RATE BY A SMALL AMOUNT ABOVE AND BELOW ITS AVERAGE. WITH MODULATED DISCHARGE, THE FASTER PART OF EACH CYCLE OVERTAKES THE SLOWER IN THE FREE STREAM. IF THIS PROCESS ISDONE PROPERLY, THE STREAM BECOMES BUNCHED INSTEAD OF UNIFORMAND A PERCUSSIVE JET IS PRODUCED. PREVIOUS RESEARCH WITH PERCUSSIVE JETS HAS BEEN SUMMARIZED. AREAS IN WHICH THE TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY NEEDS TO BE DEMONSTRATED ARE IDENTIFIED AND USED FOR A SOURCE OF PHASE I WORK.

AN IMPORTANT PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED IS HOW TO IMPLEMENT THESE MEASUREMENTS IN A COMPUTATIONALLY EFFICIENT WAY SO THAT THEY CAN BE MADE ON VERY LARGE NUMBERS OF OBJECTS WITH PRACTICAL AMOUNTS OF HARDWARE. TO THIS END, A NEW APPROACH IS BEING DEVELOPED THAT USES BULK PROCESSING OF (POSSIBLY) MULTI-SPECTRAL IMAGES TO PROVIDE HIGH PERFORMANCE WITH RELATIVELY SIMPLE HARDWARE. BASIC ALGORITHMS ARE BEING DEMONSTRATED AND EVALUATED VIA COMPUTER SIMULATION, AND PRELIMINARY DESIGN OF A PROCESSOR ARCHITECTURE IS UNDERWAY. DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF A BRASSBOARD PROCESSOR USING LOW-COST COMMERCIAL COMPONENTS WOULD BE UNDERTAKEN IN A LATER PHASE. IN ADDITION TO ITS UTLITY IN A LARGE NUMBER OF STRATEGIC DEFENSE SYSTEMS, THIS NEW APPROACH COULD ALSO BE APPLIED TO VARIOUS MILITARY RECONNAISSANCE, SURVEILLANCE AND INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS, INCLUDING THOSE FOR CRUISE-MISSILE DETECTION, AS WELL AS TO COMMERICAL ROBOTICS SYSTEMS.",

OPTICAL TECHNIQUES ARE WELL SUITEDFOR THIS PROBLEM, BECAUSE THEY OFFER SELECTIVITY, SENSITIVITY, RAPID RESPONSE, AND CAN BE USED IN EXTREME TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE ENVIRONMENTS. HOWEVER, IT IS DIFFICULT TO COMBINE THESE FEATURES IN A SINGLE SIMPLE DEVICE. INTRACAVITY DIODE LASER ABSORPTION OFFERS THE PROMISE OF COMBINING THESE FEATURES. INTRACAVITY ABSORPTIONINVOLVES PLACING THE SAMPLE WITHIN A LASER CAVITY, WHICH PROVIDES MULTIPLE PASSES THROUGH THE SAMPLE. VERY LONG ABSORPTION PATH LENGTHS CAN BE ATTAINED ON THE ORDER OF HUNDREDS OF KILOMETERS FOR A 10-CM LASER CAVITY. FURTHERMORE, THE DIODE LASERS CAN BE TUNED TO SPECIFIC WAVELENGTHS SO THAT PARTICULAR MOLECULAR SPECIES CAN BE MONITORED. IN PHASE I, AN EXTENDED CAVITY DIODE LASER WILL BE CONSTRUCTED TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF USING GAALAS DIODES FOR INTRACAVITY ABSORPTION DETECTION. THE RESULTS OBTAINED FROM THE PHASE I MEASUREMENTS WILL BE USED TO DESIGN A BREADBOARD MOLECULAR INTRACAVITY DIODE-LASER ABSORPTION SPECTROMETER (MIDAS) TO BE BUILT IN PHASE II.",

BY USING ALGAAS DIODE LASER ARRAYS AS OPTICAL ND:YAG LASER PUMPS, HIGH POWER CONVERSION EFFICIENCIES AND IMPROVED RELIABILITY VALUES ARE POSSIBLE. THE PROPOSED PROGRAM OFFERS TWO INNOVATIVE CONCEPTS, BOTH BASED ON SPIRE'S ESTABLISHED GAAS/ALGAAS CONCENTRATOR SOLAR CELL TECHNOLOGY. THE FIRST CONCEPT IS BASED ON THE USE OF MOCVD TO GROW HIGHLY UNIFORM, LARGE AREA WAFERS FOR USE IN FABRICATING LOW COST DIODE LASER ARRAYS. THE COST AND YIELDS OF MOCVD MATERIAL ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE FAVORABLE THAN THOSE OF LPE GROWN MATERIAL. THE SECOND CONCEPT INVOLVES THE APPLICATION OF SPIRE-DEVELOPED GAAS CONCENTRATOR CELL TECHNOLOGIES TO DIODE LASER ARRAYS. SEMICONDUCTOR WAFER AND THERMAL PACKAGING COST CONSIDERATIONS ARE THE PRIMARY DRIVING FORCES WHICH LEAD TO THE PRESENT HIGH COSTS OF DIODE LASER ARRAYS.

DUE TO ITS ELECTRON SATURATED DRIFT VELOCITY AND RADIATION RESISTANCE, INP ISAN EXCELLENT MATERIAL FOR USE IN HIGH SPEED ELECTRON DEVICES AND SPACEAPPLICATIONS. SILICON IS AN OPTIMAL SUBSTRATE MATERIAL DUE TO THE AVAILABILITY OF HIGH PURITY, LARGE AREA, LOW COST WAFERS. COMPARED TOINP, SI HAS VERY HIGH STRENGTH-TO-WEIGHT RATIO AND THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY. THE GROWTH PROCESS BEING DEVELOPED WOULD PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY, SINGLE CRYSTAL INP ON SI THAT COULD LEAD TO THE ESTABLISHMENTOF AN INP-ON-SI DEVICE TECHNOLOGY. IN THE INITIAL RESEARCH EFFORT, THE FEASBILITY IS BEING DEMONSTRATED OF DEPOSITING SINGLE-CRYSTAL FILMS OF INP ONTO SI SUBSTRATES AND THE STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES OF THESEFILMS CHARACTERIZED. OPTIMIZATION OF THE GROWTH PARAMETERS AND DEMONSTRATION OF DEVICE-QUALITY MATERIAL WOULD BE SUBJECTS OF A LATER RESEARCH EFFORT. THE DEVELOPMENT OF A GROWTH PROCESS FOR INP ON SILICON WOULD PROVIDE A STRONG BASIS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF LARGE SCALE INTEGRATION OF HIGH SPEED, RADIATION HARD INP DEVICES ON HIGH QUALITY, LOW COST, LARGE AREA SUBSTRATES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF DEVICE QUALITY INP ON SILICON COULD BE EFFECTIVELY UTILIZED IN TRANSISTORS, PHOTODETECTORS, LASERS, MICROWAVE COMMUNICATIONS DEVICES, AND THE MONOLITHIC INTEGRATION OF INP OPTOELECTRONIC DEVICES WITH SILICON LOGIC CIRCUITS.",

THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED BY GRAFTING QUAT MONOMER TO THE SUR- FACE OF THE DOME OR BY TREATMENT WITH A QUAT SILANE TO FORM AN INTERPENETRATING NETWORK ON AND JUST UNDER THE SURFACE. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT IF THE FIRST LAYER OF FOULING CAN BE PREVENTED, THERE WILL BE NO FURTHER FOULING. TREATED SUR- FACES WILL BE EVALUATED FOR MICROFOULING RESISTANCE. MACROFOULING OF SONAR DOMES BY BARNACLES AND OTHER FORMS CAUSES DEGRADATION IN SONAR PERFORMANCE. BUTYL TIN BASED ANTIFOULANTS ARE PRESENTLY USED TO PREVENT THIS GROWTH, BUT THESE COMPOUNDS ARE TOXIC AND PRESENT A HAZARD TO NAVY PERS-ONNEL DURING INSTALLATION AND REMOVAL OF DOMES. PHASE I DEMONSTRATED THE FEASIBILITY OF ALTERNATE TREATMENT SYSTEMS BASED ON QUATERNARY AMMONIUM SILANES, QUATERNARY METHACRYLA-MIDE POLYMERS AND COPPER TANNATE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH LOW SURFACE ENERGY TREATMENTS, INCLUDING FLUOROSILANES AND FLUOROPOLYMERS. THIS PHASE II PROGRAM WILL DEVELOP IPN (INTERPENSTRATING POLYMER NETWORK) SURFACE IMPREGNATION SYS-TEMS BASED ON THE PHASE I CONCEPT. THESE SYSTEMS WILL CON- TAIN A BIOCID(E.G. QUATERNARY AMMONIUM SILANE) TO PREVENT THE PRELIMINARY BACTERIAL BIOLAYER FROM FORMING, A LOW SUR- FACE ENERGY TREATMENT (E.G. FLUOROSILANE) TO DETER THE BIO- LAYER FROM ADHERING TO THE SURFACE, ALL IN AN IPN IMPREGNA- TION TREATMENT TO ENSURE GOOD ABRASION RESISTANCE.

IN THE CONVENTIONAL BRONZE PROCESS, THE LOW TIN CONTENT OF THE 13.5-WT% SN BRONZE SERIOUSLY LIMITS THE CURRENT DENSITY AND LEAVES MUCH OF THE NB UNREACTED. THE RELATIVELY HIGH MELTING POINT, HIGHER SN BRONZES HAVE NOT BEEN USED BECAUSE THEY ARE REGARDED AS LARGELY UNWORKABLE. THUS, OTHER PROCESSES WERE DEVELOPED THAT USE EITHER PURE SN OR LOW MELTING POINT SN-RICH COMPOSITIONS (E.G., THE INTERNAL TIN AND THE DISTRIBUTED TIN METHODS) THAT FORCE EXTRUSION AND DRAWING TO BE DONE WARM OR COLD TO AVOID MELTING THE SN SOURCE. THE LOW TEMPERATURE WORKING SERIOUSLY AFFECTS FABRICATION COSTS AND LEADS TO BONDING PROBLEMS. THE PLANNED METHOD WILL USE THE HIGHER MELTING, EXTRA-HIGH SN BRONZES, BUT IN A MANNER THAT GREATLY OVERCOMES THE WORKABILITY PROBLEM. THE HIGHER SN CONTENT BRONZES WILL PROMOTE HIGHER CURRENT DENSITIES, SHORTER REACTION TIMES, MORE UNIFORM NB3SN LAYERS THROUGHOUT, LESS UNREACTED NB, ANDMORE EFFICIENT USE OF THE BRONZE VOLUME IN THE SUPERCONDUCTOR. ALSO, THE PROCESS WILL PERMIT USE OF SOLID RATHER THAN HOLLOW NB ELEMENTS, WHICH WILL BE LESS COSTLY AND ALLOW THE FABRICATION OF VERY FINE FILAMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE HIGHER MELTING POINT OF THE PROPOSED SN BRONZEOFFERS THE PROSPECT OF HIGHER EXTRUSION TEMPERATURES, HIGHER EXTRUSION RATIOS, AND FASTER DRAWING SPEEDS THAN ARE POSSIBLE WITH THE LOWER MELTING POINT SN SOURCES IN OTHER PROCESSES.",

EMPHASIS WILL BE PLACED IN DETERMINING THE RATE-LIMITING PARAMETER FOR SWITCHING (E.G., SIDEWAYS DOMAIN WALL SPEED IN THE CASE OF KNO[3]), DEPENDENCE OF SWITCHING TIMES UPON FILM THICKNESS, CELL AREA, AND EXTERNAL LOAD. IN KNO(3) IT IS KNOWN THAT THERE IS A MINIMUM IN THE DEPENDENCEOF SWITCHING VOLTAGE UPON THICKNESS WITH A THICKNESS WINDOW OF 65 TO 800 NM OVER WHICH SWITCHING VOLTAGES LIE BELOW A 4.5V (THE STANDARD TTL/CMOS LOGIC LEVELS FOR SILICON INTEGRATED CIRCUITS). THIS THICKNESS DEPENDENCE WILL BE DETERMINED FOR PB(5)GE(3-X)SI(X)O(11) AND BI(4)TI(3)O(12) IN THE PRESENT WORK. IN THE CASE OF THE LEAD GERMANATE ALLOYS, THE ADDITION OF SILICON IS PROPOSED TO ELIMINATE (OR AT LEAST MINIMIZE) THE PROBLEM OF LEAKAGE CURRENT IN THE MEMORY CELLS. FATIGUE STUDIED WILL BE MADE WITH EMPHASIS UPON THE THEORETICAL MODEL OF SROLOVITZ.

THE CONNECTIONS SIMPLY CANNOT HANDLE ELECTRIC SIGNALS FAST ENOUGH AND RELIABLY ENOUGH. IN ADVANCED SYSTEMS, THE POWER DRAIN AND THE SHEER NUMBERS OF THE WIRES LINKING THE CHIPS, AND LINKING THE CIRCUIT BOARDS, IS PROHIBITIVE. CONNECTING CIRCUITS BY LIGHT INSTEAD OF BY ELECTRIC SIGNALS PROMISES RELIEF. UNDER PHASE II OF THIS SBIR PROGRAM, WE PLAN TO EXPERIMENTALLY DEMONSTRATE INTEGRATEDD OPTICAL WAVEGUIDES THAT ALLOW OPTICAL CHANNELS TO BE INCORPORATED WITHIN OPTE-ELECTRONIC DEVICES AND PACKAGES. IN ADDITION WE WILL EXPLORE THEORETICALLY THE FULL POTENTIAL OF INTRABOARD OPTICAL INTERCONNECTIONS WHEN OPTO-ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS ARE INTEGRATED MONLITHICALLYWITH HIGH SPEED ELECTRONICS. THIS ANALYSIS WILL PROVIDE DIRECT CLUES TOWARD ELIMINATION OF THE EXCESS CAPACITANCE AND INDUCTANCE OF BONDING PADS AND WIRES WHICH SHOULD RESULTIN MONOLITHIC COMBINATIONS THAT OPERATE FASTER, USE LESS POWER, AND PRODUCE LESS NOISE THAT THE PRESENT HYBRIDS.",

RESEARCH IN THE PAST DECADE IN AUTOMATIC TARGET RECOGNITION AND REALTIME TRACKING METHODS HAS PRODUCED A NEW GENERATION OF ALGORITHMS APPROPRIATE TO THE TRACKING REQUIREMENT. WHILE SOME OF THE ALGORITHMS ARE PROPRIETARY AND THE CLOSELY GUARDED SECRETS OF COMPANIES RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR DEVELOPMENT, A VERY LARGE PERCENTAGE ARE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN. THESE ALGORITHMS ARE THE TOOLS BY WHICH THE TRACKING FUNCTION CAN BE PERFORMED. WSMR IS A NATIONAL LEADER IN TRACKING TECHNOLOGY, BUT THE ALGORITHMS EMPLOYED IN THE REAL-TIME VIDEO TRACKER ARE OVER TEN YEARS OLD, AND MANY IMPROVED \"IMAGE INTERPRETATION\" ALGORITHMS EXIST THAT WILL FURTHER EXTEND THE RTV CLASS OF TRACKING SYSTEM. TSI WILL PERFORM RESEARCH UNDER THIS CONTRACT TO SURVEY EXISTING TRACKER ARCHITECTURES, DEVELOP A CONCEPUTAL DESIGN OF A MODERN TRACKER ARCHITECTURE, SYNTHESIZER TRACKER ALGORITHM REQUIREMENTS, AND IDENTIFY AND EVALUATE EXISTING ALGORITHMS AND EMERGING RESEARCH RESULTS AGAINST THESE CRITERIA. A REPORT WILL BE PREPARED THAT SUMMARIZES ALL OF THE RELEVANT INFORMATION, IN TECHNICAL REPORT FORMAT, SUITABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION INTERNAL TO THE GOVERNMENT.

THESE GUIDES ARE WRITTEN IN NATURAL LANGUAGE, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF EXPERT TRAINING SYSTEMS OR EXPERT JOB AIDING ALWAYS REQUIRES THAT A KNOWLEDGE ENGINEER REDUCE THE TRAINING DATA INTO EXPERT RULES FOR A RULE BASE. THE TARS METHOD USES AN INITIAL REDUCTION OF NATURAL LANGUAGE INTO AN INTERMEDIATE ENGLISH/LOGIC LANGUAGE COMPOSITE, THEN FURTHER REDUCES THE ENGLISH/LOGIC COMPOSITE TO A FORM VERY CLOSE TO THE FINAL RULES DESIRED. THE PRELIMINARY METHODOLOGY INVOLVES A SERIES OF STEPS FOR THE KNOWLEDGE ENGINEER SIMILAR TO THE SERIES OF STEPS PERFORMED IN THE WRITING OF WELL-STRUCTURED SOFTWARE IN ALGORITHMIC LANGUAGES.",

THE PHASE I EFFORT WILL DEVELOP THE IMPEDANCE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE THAT RELATES THE ELECTRICAL IMPEDANCE CHARACTERISTICS OF AN ULTRASONIC TRANSDUCER TO THE PROPERTIES OF A BONDED SAMPLE WITH WHICH IT IS IN CONTACT. PERFORMANCE OF THE TECHNIQUE WILL BE EVALUATED BY IT'S CAPABILITY TO DETECT AN UNBOND CONDITION IN WHICH THE RUBBER AND METAL ARE IN INTIMATE CONTACT. THEORETICAL WORK WILL CONSIDER THE ELECTRICAL EQUIVALENT CIRCUIT MODEL OF TRANSDUCER INCLUDING THE ACOUSTIC LOADING PRESENTED BY THE SAMPLE WITH WHICH IT IS IN CONTACT. EXPERIMENTAL WORK WILL INCLUDE DEVELOPMENT OF SUITABLE TRANSDUCERS AND ANALYSIS OF IMPEDANCE DATA USING INVERSE ACOUSTIC MODELING TECHNIQUES TO INFER MATERIAL CHARACTERISTICS RELATING TO THE BONDED AND UNBONDED CONDITION. A NUMBER OF CONTROLLED RUBBER-TO-METAL BONDED SAMPLES WILL BE MANUFACTURED AND INSPECTED TO DETERMINE THE SUITABILITY AND LIMITS OF PERFORMANCE OF THE PROPOSED METHOD.",

HOWEVER,THESE SYSTEMS ARE EXPENSIVE ($35,000-$45,000) AND THEY ARE NOT COST EFFECTIVE FOR MOST LABORATORIES. FURTHERMORE, IT IS STILL UNCLEAR WHETHER THE MEASUREMENTS THAT ARE DERIVED FROM THESE SYSTEMS HAVE CLINICAL RELEVANCE. AT THE FERTILITY TESTING LABORATORY, A NEW PROTOTYPE SYSTEM FOR SPERM MOTION ANALYSIS AND AUTOMATED SEMEN ANALYSIS HAS BEEN DEVELOPED WHICH HAS COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH CAPABILITIES IN ITS BASIC DESIGN, BUT IT HAS BEEN STREAMLINED FOR PRACTICAL CLINICAL USE. THIS SYSTEM MEASURES SPERM DENSITY, PERCENT MOTILITY, INSTANTANEOUS VELOCITY, CURVILINEAR VELOCITY, NET VELOCITY, PROGRESSIVENESS RATIO, AND COURSE DIRECTION CHANGE. COURSE DIRECTION CHANGE IS A NEW MEASUREMENT THAT ALLOWS RECORDING THE ANGULAR CHANGES OF THE SPERM TRACKS ON A FRAME-TO-FRAME BASIS. PLANNED RESEARCH WILL CONTINUE WITH THE PROTOTYPE SYSTEM BY EXAMINING A VARIETY OF CLINICALSPECIMENS FROM INFERTILITY PATIENTS AND DONORS, AND ANALYZING THESE DATA WITH STATITICAL ANALYSIS ROUTINES INCORPORATED INTO COMPUTER SOFTWARE.

FURTHER, ITS PHYSICAL PROPERTIES LIMIT METHODS OF STERILIZATION AND ITS USEFULNESS FOR MULTIPLE USE. A SUBSTITUTE FOR REGENERA-TED CELLULOSE IS BEING SOUGHT BY DEVICE MANUFACTURERS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO DEVELOP ALTERNATIVES TO REGENERATED CELLULOSE. A VARIETY OF POLYMERS WILL BE FORMULATED THAT SHOULD POSSESS SUPERIOR BIOCOMPATIBILITY TO REGENERATED CELLULOSE, THAT HAVE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES SUITED TO REUSE AND ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF STERILIZATION, AND THAT CAN BE FABRICATED INTO MEMBRANES BY ECONOMICALLY VIABLE METHODS. THE MEMBRANES WILL BE TESTED IN VITRO TO (1) COMPARE THEIR BIOCOMPATIBILITY TO REGENERATED CELLULOSE, (2)EXAMINE THEIR THROMBOGENIC POTENTIAL, (3) EVALUATE THEIR PROPENSITY TO ACTIVATE COMPLEMENT, AND (4) ASSESS THEIR DIRECT ACTION, IF ANY, ON THE CELLULAR COMPONENTS OF BLOOD. UNIVERSITY MEDICAL ASSOCIATES WILL ENSURE THE MATERIALS ARE RESISTANT TO THE CHEMICALS USED FOR DIALYZER REUSE AND THAT THEY CAN BE FABRICATED INTO MEMBRANES WITH MASS TRANSFER PROPERTIES SUITABLE FOR HEMODIALYSIS. IN PHASE II OF THE PROGRAM, THE MOST PROMISING MATERIALS WILL BE FABRICATED INTO DIALYZERS AND THE RESULTS CONFIRMED IN VIVO USING AN ANIMAL MODEL. THIS WILL LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND CLINICAL TRIALS OF CLINICAL DIALYZERS.",

THE SLATE IS A STAND-ALONE SUBSYSTEM WHICH PROBES THE SYSTEM THROUGH A LAN. THE SLATE ASSISTS IN THE DETECTION AND ISOLATION OF FAULTS TO THE SUBSYSTEM LEVEL. FAULT DETECTION IS ACHIEVED THROUGH NON-INTRUSIVE PERFORMANCE MONITORING, SYSTEM MESSAGE FLOW ANALYSIS AND/OR PERIODIC INTERACTION WITH THE SUBSYSTEMS. FAULT ISOLATION CAPABILITIES BEGIN WITH A SET OF COMMANDS AVAILABLE TO THE USER FOR INTERACTING WITH OTHER SUBSYSTEMS ON THE NETWORK. THE COMMANDS CAN BE EXECUTED INDIVIDUALLY OR GROUPED TOGETHER AS COMMAND SEQUENCES. THE SLATE RECORDS THE PROCEDURE AND COMMAND SEQUENCES USED TO ISOLATE A FAULT AND ALLOWS THE USER TO REVIEW, EDIT AND SAVE THE PROCEDURE ON COMPLETION. ONCE A BASE OF THESE DIAGNOSTIC ROUTINES FOR A SYSTEM HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED, THE DETECTION OF A FAULT BY THE SLATE CAN BE MAPPED INTO THE APPROPRIATE SET OF DIAGNOSTIC ROUTINES FOR AUTOMATIC FAULT ISOLATION AND REPORTING.

THIS HAS LED TO DIVERGENT INTERPRETATIONS OF STRATEGIC TARGET PHENOMENOLOGY IN THE EXO-ATMOSPHERE REGION. THE RESOLUTION OF THIS CONTROVERSY IS CRITICAL TO THE FURTHER MODELING, DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF INFRARED SENSORS FOR STRATEGIC DEFENSE APPLICATIONS. THE CALIBRATION ACCURACY OF FIVE SELECTED STARS IS BEING ANALYZED TO DEVELOP AN INFRARED STELLAR DATABOOK CONTAINING ABSOLUTE STANDARDS FOR USE BY THE INFRAREDCOMMUNITY. THIS ANALYSIS IS CONSIDERING DATA OVER THE 0.2 - 100 MICRON WAVELENGTH REGIONS FROM VARIOUS BASED SENSORS. PRELIMINARY RESULTS SHOW THE CONSISTENCY OF THESE MEASUREMENTS FOR A STAR SUCH AS ALPHA TAU TO BE BETTER THAN 6% (1 SIGMA). THE REQUIREMENTS FOR A SIMPLE BUT FUNDAMENTALLY ACCURATE CALIBRATION SENSOR ARE ALSO BEING DEFINED. THIS SENSOR WOULD ENABLE THE CROSS CALIBRATION OF EXISTING GROUND CHAMBERS, SUCH AS PORTABLE OPTICAL SENSOR TESTER (POST) AND ADVANCED SENSOR EVALUATION AND TEST (ASET), AND LINKING OF THESE CHAMBER CALIBRATIONS WITH THE STELLAR INFRARED STANDARDS. THE ABSOLUTE ACCURACY ACHIEVABLE WITH THIS SENSOR IS ANTICIPATED AT 3% (1 SIGMA). THIS ANALYSIS IS NEEDED BY THE INFRARED COMMUNITY (GOVERNMENT, INDUSTRY, UNIVERSITY) TO CONSOLIDATE AND COLLABORATE THE EXISTING INFRARED DATABASE.",

THE QUASI-OPTICAL GYROTRON IS A NEW FORM OF GYROTRON IN WHICH THE STANDARD MICROWAVE CAVITY IS REPLACED BY A LARGE OPTICAL CAVITY. THE OVERALL CONFIGURATION OF THE DEVICE AND THE LARGE CAVITY ARE SUITABLE IN PRINCIPLE FOR PRODUCTION OF VERY LARGE POWERS. THE PROPOSED STUDY IS TO DETERMINE, THROUGH CALCULATION, THE FEASIBILITY OF A 5-MW CW, 300-GHZ QUASI-OPTICAL GYROTRON. EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON THE STUDY OF ELECTRON BEAM GENERATION AND PROPAGATION AND THE OPTICAL CAVITY, WITH THE GOAL OF REALIZING A PRELIMINARY DESIGN WITH AN EFFICIENCY OF OVER 30%.

A NOVEL CONCEPT CONCEIVED BY THE PROPOSER THATUTILIZES SOLID STATE PIEZOELECTRIC SENSOR AND ACTUATOR TECHNOLOGY INDICATES THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO PROVIDE BOTH ICESENSING AND ICE PROTECTION WITH THE SAME MATERIAL. THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THIS SYSTEM UTILIZE POLYVINYLIDENE FLUORIDE (PVDF) TRANSDUCER FILM MATERIAL BEING EVALUATED FOR USE IN BOTH SENSING AND ACTUATING COMPONENTS AND A MICROPROCESSOR FOR DIGITAL SIGNAL FILTERING AND FOR CLOSED LOOP DEICING CONTROL. DUE TO ITS EXCELLENT PIEZOELECTRIC PROPERTIES AND BROADBAND RESPONSE, THE PVDF FILM IS ABLE TO SENSE THE VIBRATORY MOTION OF AN ICE ACCRETION SURFACE RESPONDING TO FREQUENCIES FROM A FEW HZ TO KHZ AND HIGHER. BY INCORPORATING A MICROPROCESSOR INTO THIS SYSTEM, A NUMBER OFDESIGN ADVANTAGES IMMEDIATELY BECOME AVAILABLE. IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO CONSTRUCT AN ISIPS THAT DETERMINES THE ICE ONSET, ACCRETION AND ACCRETION RATE AND PROVIDES FOR THE CONTROLLED DISSIPATION OF ICE ON HELICOPTER BLADES, AIRCRAFTWINGS, PARKED AIRCRAFT, AIRCRAFT COMPONENTS, AIRPORT RUNWAYSAND FACILITIES, AND AIRPORT NAVIGATION AID STRUCTURES AS WELL.",
