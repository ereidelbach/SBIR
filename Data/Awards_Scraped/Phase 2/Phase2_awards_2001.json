To complete the situational awareness picture, there is also the need to depict terrestrial threat types, locations, and envelopes, as well as blue force operational data, to optimize thesynergistic effects derived from using space assets to support land, sea and air operations.

        "abstract": "Abstract         60165       The Gulf Stream off the southeastern coast of Florida is a natural source of renewable energy that is ready for development using todays technology.  Unlike other renewable sources, water flows 24 hours a day and can be counted on as a base source of electric power.   This project will utilize the Underwater Electric Kite, which has been tested in the Niagara River and is ready for ocean deployment.  A multi-discipline team has been assembled to determine the best location, taking the cost into consideration as well as such technical factors as:  (1) the anticipated water velocity and its tolerance in magnitude and direction, (2) detailed plans for cable and vessel design for the water velocity and the ocean environment, and (3) the electric design to bring the power to shore safely and reliably.  In Phase I, the Underwater Electric Kite was sized for the 180 cm/sec water flow and all power components were selected.  The cable and mooring technique was conceptually completed.  In Phase II, a detailed design of the Underwater Electric Kite will be completed and production drawings will be created.  A communication method between the shore and the vessel will be developed along with a maximum power tracking strategy.  Finally, a prototype ocean current power generator will be built and tested in Chesapeake Bay.              Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: Present estimates show that a 10MW generator park can be built for $3.56 per watt.  This would have a factor of six advantage over photovoltaics: a two-to-one advantage in installation cost and a three to one advantage in running 24 hours per day instead of 8.  Once the prototype is operational, Florida utilities should be anxious to take advantage of a free fuel source of power that needs no real estate, cant be seen, cant be heard, cant be smelled, and is environmentally, ecologically, and economically attractive.",

However, their adoption is impaired by the lack of a robust, cost-effective fabrication process, principally because the autoclaves used to consolidate composite laminates are so expensive for large parts. This program develops for US aerospace companies the processing equipment that avoids the autoclave. In particular, this program will develop in situ deposition heads that can fit on aerospace company's existing placement machines so that air and spacecraft composites can be fabricated out of the autoclave.In phase I, the deposition head concept designs will be prepared and reviewed with leading aerospace industry contacts who we know from working with them on a multitude of non-autoclave processing programs in the past. There, we will get feedback for our head concept designs suitable for fabricating the thermoset and thermoplastic composite parts that they need. In phase II, we will complete the design, fabricate, and prove-out the head equipment. We then will provide in situ deposition heads to the industry that they can use for in situ consolidation of large composite parts.",

Significant advances in devices thatproduce these high-power, short pulses have been made in the US and abroad in the past few decades. As a result, the need for devices that can protect sensitive communications equipment from such devices is greater than ever. The plasma limiter devicebeing developed in this program has the potential to be the most effective transient suppression device available. The primary objective of the proposed Phase II program is the development of a large-scale plasma limiter that can reflect up to 10 kW ofX-band RF power in a response time less than 1 nsec. The device will be implemented in both rectangular waveguide (such as WR90) and stripline packaging. Usage of the limiter will be aimed at front-end protection. An additional specification of the devicewill be low insertion loss, < 0.1 dB.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Wound infection is the single-most              important complication encountered in the management of chronic non-healing          wounds. More than 10 million US patients per annum, at a cost of greater than        $10 billion, receive treatment for chronic wounds. Microorganisms not only           interfere with the wound healing process but use open areas as portals of entry      for systemic infection. Current clinical strategies rely on the use of topical       or systemic antibiotics for controlling wound bioburden. In Phase I we proposed      studying the feasibility of incorporating wound exudate responsive chemistry         capable of producing elemental iodine directly into a moist wound dressing           material. Iodine is antimicrobial at non-toxic levels for tissue but is              extremely unstable in its antimicrobial I2 form. Our proposal involved               encapsulation of iodine precursors along with conversion chemistry directly          into a well known wound contact material. The Phase I results found that             signals commonly found in wound exudate fluid triggered the conversion of            iodine precursors to antimicrobial elemental iodine. The Phase II studies are        aimed at refining the chemistry of the reaction to provide greater control on        the rates of production and sustained release of the iodine. Completion of           these studies will yield a novel wound sensing antimicrobial dressing for            controlling wound bioburden.

It is anticipated that such models will be incorporated in certain modules of theModular Effectiveness/Vulnerability Assessment (MEVA) code developed for and currently used by the Air Force for assessing munitions effectiveness and target vulnerability.  Current engineering models employ resistance functions and/or regression analysisin ways that are unnecessarily restrictive, thereby losing the fidelity inherent in HFPB models.  Generalization of these accepted techniques offers the means of over coming restrictions that have limited both the fidelity and utility of conventionalengineering/fast-running models.  The new modeling techniques incorporating higher fidelity physics, enhanced response/damage visualization, and improved stochastic modeling have been demonstrated.",

While the attenuation of structural vibration and structure-borne sound using passive means is the current state-of-the-art, and active structural acoustic control (ASAC) has received wide attention in the academic community in the past decade, a functional system combining the relative advantages of both approaches has yet to be developed and tested. A successful development and demonstration of such a system will, therefore, constitute a major innovation in the field of structure-borne sound control. The proposed system is a complete sound attenuation solution, including passive-only, active-only, and hybrid surface mounted patches. These patches are completely encapsulated and ready to be bonded to the fuselage panels. The system further includes error sensor, pre-amplifiers, control implementation electronics, and power electronics for the active and hybrid patches. In addition, a comprehensive design methodology is developed for the optimal placement and sizing of the three types of patches, as well as for control law design. The development of such methodology, backed up by commercial manufacturing capability and solid design techniques, will greatly advance the goal of reducing noise pollution in aircraft interiors.",

Internet-based seismic processing (INSP) enables exploration companies to directly control their critical seismic imaging projects, without the need of purchasing and maintaining expensive hardware and software. INSP is a complete processing system that includes a client-based Java GUI, and server-based processing and database modules. The computationally intensive modules run on shared-memory parallel computers and Linux clusters. Phase I implemented the essential functionalities for a useful product, demonstrated concept feasibility, and laid the groundwork for the Phase II project. Phase II will add functionality to the product, and implement all security and data management aspects necessary for Internet deployment. INSP ushers in a paradigm shift for the upstream oil and gas industry. Commercial potential is significant because INSP makes digital information and compute-intensive technology accessible to a large client base that wishes to outsource its non-core competencies to an application service provider, while maintaining control of projects. INSP greatly increases interaction between the client and contractor, thereby increasing the quality of the final seismic image, and reducing exploration and development cost.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Active Signal Technologies proposes to further develop its self applied, electrodeless home monitoring device for sleep apnea with the ultimate goal of making clinical diagnosis available to a much larger population of sleep disorder patients than currently possible. Preliminary results from Phase I have shown that much of the diagnostically rich airflow information captured in the sleep lab with a nasal mask and pneumotachograph can be replicated using an unobtrusive external tracheal contact sensor. Because this flow data has such important ramifications, the present proposal is being directed primarily to optimizing the sensor to work uniformly across a wide variety of cervical morphometries, and building real-time signal processing routines to separate snore, obstruction sounds, etc, from the broadband \"hiss\" of pure air movement in the trachea. This specific focus recognizes the broad application potential of the breathing sensor, not only as a critical component for the home monitoring device and as an alternative to a mask in the sleep lab but also throughout the field of respiratory care. In addition, the sensor captures far more acoustic information than just quantitative tidal volume and qualitative flow patterns, and hence can be used to characterize obstruction, respiratory effort, etc. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: With approximately 10 million people suffering from obstructive sleep apnea alone yet <250,000 being tested per year in sleep clinics, the AAMS has a huge potential market. The AAMS priced at $1000 provides the patient with a cost-effective, accurate screening option in the comfort of his or her home.",

The removeal of the diode laser pumps also removes a large heat load from the laser head structure.  The smallsize of the laser transmitter reduces optical losses that would be present from coupling optics and from vibration and jitter pointing induced errors.  Aculight will deliver a compact laser IRCM source for navy testing at the conclusion of ths work.",

These transmitters must be UAV flight deployable and operate efficiently at a high repetition rate and low pulse energy. Aculight proposes to address this need with a compositionally tuned garnet laser that operates directly at the wavelength of interest. This quasi-four level laser material requires a very bright pump source to operate efficiently at low pulse energies. Aculight's innovation is a revolutionary technique that when applied to diode bar can increase their output brightness by well over an order of magnitude. This will be the first demonstration of a solid state laser pumped using this technique and will lead to an entirely new class of laser systems. Coupling this with Aculight's advanced manufacturing techniques that allow lasers can be dropped from a height of three feet without effecting their performance and Aculight's extensive background in laser engineering will lead to a flight worthy water vapor DIAL transmitter in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The Air Force and other branches of the armed forces require compact and cost-effective, high power (10s of Watts) sources of mid-infrared radiation at wavelengths within atmospheric transmission bands. Thermal issues in solid-state lasers have so farlimited the performance of these devices at long wavelengths.  By contrast gas lasers can provide power scalability, however these devices are typically large and require significant logistical support to deploy.Aculight proposes a new approach to address this problem through the use of a fiber laser based pump source in combination with an optically pumped molecular gas laser. This approach blends the best properties of diodes and fibers (efficient, compact,reliable) with the power handling capability of gas converters. The proposed approach is inherently scalable to very high average powers by combining the outputs from many smaller fiber-based pumps in the gas converter, and is electrically driven,simplifying deployment logistics.In Phase I Aculight conclusively demonstrated the viability of such a pump source generating, to our knowledge, the highest narrowband pulse output from a fiber-based system with energies in excess of 100 microJoules. In Phase II we will develop anddeliver a narrowband, pulsed, diode-pumped fiber system operating at 1.567microns utilizing Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFA's)such as those employed in the telecommunications industry. This source will be used to demonstrate optical pumping of a COlaser which operates in the atmospheric transmission window at 4.7 microns.",

Phase II will develop a new laser technology for mini-DIAL measurements of water vapor. DIAL transmitter requirements will be achieved using a revolutionary technology that allows diffraction limited performance from diode bars. These ultra bright diode bars enable efficient end pumped, q-switched, low-gain, quasi-three level lasers. Recently, a laser material that operates directly at the 944.1 nanometer water vapor absorption line has become commercially available. Coupling these two technologies will result in an efficient compact DIAL transmitter. This technology will result in a new class of compact, efficient, and low-cost DIAL transmitters for atmospheric water vapor profiling. Low cost DIAL transmitters are important for future improvements in weather forecasting, global climate models, and understanding of the transmission of communication signals in the atmosphere.

These models require environmental data on a micro scale from the area where operations are being conducted.  ADATechnologies, Inc. has designed and fabricated a miniature Microenvironmental Sensor Package (MSP) to make local measurements of these necessary environmental parameters and send the data to a field portable, hand-held data collection/processing stationfor use in the computer models.  Each MSP is self-contained with no moving parts, and is designed to collect data for up to 72 hours including temperatures, wind conditions, humidity, and precipitation.  A GPS unit provides data on each MSP location, and aradio modem transmits data to the central collection point. Fully automated, the MSP needs no maintenance once deployed.  In Phase II, ADA will reduce the weight of the MSP to under 12 ounces, and will finalize a rugged package design.  The hand-held datacollection station will be programmed to automatically network the MSPs and process the transmitted data, and field trials of the system will be conducted.  Twenty MSPs and four hand-held data collection stations will be delivered to the Army for extensiveevaluation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In December 2000, EPA announced its intent to regulate the emission of mercury from coal-fired power plants. ADA Technologies, Inc., is developing a family of new disposable sorbents for this application. The sorbents consist of a natural silicate doped with chemicals to capture and immobilize vapor-phase mercury and mercury compounds. Laboratory testing in Phase I has shown the new materials to have two to three times the capacity for mercury compared to activated carbon, with projected costs lower than those for activated carbon. In Phase II, a reproducible preparation process that can be scaled to mass production will be developed. Additional laboratory tests will be run to characterize the relative mercury removal performances of the several candidate dopant chemicals. Once the optimum formulation has been identified, a test will be run in which sorbent is injected into the exhaust gas from a pilot coal combustor. The project team includes an architect/engineering firm and a major supplier of the natural silicate raw material. One project team member has committed to a cash investment to secure Option funding for Phase II, when prototype sorbent performance milestones are met. In the Option task, the project team will set up a pilot test system at an operating power plant, and will evaluate performance of the new sorbent on a slipstream of flue gas from the plant. A joint venture will be established in parallel with the Phase II project to commercialize the new sorbent. EPA is due to issue draft regulations for mercury control in 2003, and finalize them in 2004. By 2007, a total of 1,100 power plants in the United States will be required to control mercury emissions. Estimated control costs using activated carbon range from $2 billion to $5 billion annually, with carbon costs comprising well over $1 billion of that total. The high-performance ADA sorbent will be a drop-in replacement for activated carbon, with similar low capital equipment and installation costs. The joint-venture partners will bring experience in the utility industry, production of the raw material, and development of mercury control technologies to the new entity. The joint venture will market a mercury control solution to the utility industry - one that includes equipment, sorbent, and installation/startup elements. Additional applications for the new sorbent include replacement of activated carbon in municipal waste and medical waste incinerators, and in industrial processes where mercury control is an issue, such as precious metals production.",

Leaving this key need unmet results in continued excess waste generation, increased personnel radiation exposure, adverse environmental impact, excessive D & D costs, and chronic schedule delays.   This project will combine the proven capabilities of electro-decontamination and strippable encapsulation coatings to produce a safe, cost-effective, and easily deployed decontamination system.  Phase I proved the feasibility of formulating an electrolyte that possesses the chemical and physical properties needed for highly effective and practical field use, created a hardware package to prove that the proposed decontamination concept is acceptable to potential users and performs as desired, and successfully demonstrated the operation of the new D & D system on a number of test coupons.  Phase II will optimize, field-test, and validate the new decontamination system for commercial introduction.  Specific Phase II objectives include:  (1) development of a fully optimized electrolyte gel formulation, and (2) design and fabrication of a deployment hardware package suitable for field-testing and immediate commercialization.                  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: While primarily targeted at D & D applications in the DOE nuclear weapons complex, many applications should exist in the civilian sector, such as cleaning conductive objects and surfaces contaminated with hazardous, toxic, and biohazardous materials.

These tools were used to model and analyze the assembly of a ship's double bottom blocks, and to model weld shrinkageand distortion, the principal sources of dimensional variation in shipbuilding. The potential applicability of DCS dimensional variation modeling, simulation, and analysis processes and tools is already very high within the shipbuilding industry.  However,during Phase II the improvement of dimensional variation modeling capabilities associated with weld shrinkage and distortion modeling, the refinement of dimensional management processes to suit the industry, and the involvement of U.S. shipyards in thedevelopment and evaluation of these processes and tools, will greatly improve the potential applicability of dimensional management practices  within the shipbuilding industry.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research proposal will develop porous dielectrics as a low-cost, large-area detector for high spatial resolution x-ray detection. An alternative to microchannel plates, porous dielectric electron amplifiers are formed by a thin layer, generally less than 1 mm, of a low density dielectric. The microscopic pores formed in such material, provide a natural, but miniaturized, dynode chain for electron amplification when an electric field is applied. An x-ray photon striking the material sets off an avalanche of electrons, creating 100,000 or more electrons per incident photon. However, the small size of the pores along with a preference for propagation in the direction of the electric field result in a limited spread of output electrons from the location of the incident photon. By coupling the porous dielectric to a high resolution anode, we will be able to achieve spatial resolutions of 30 microns or better. Porous dielectrics are easily deposited, which allows the construction of detectors with areas exceeding 100 cm2, at a fraction of the cost of microchannel plates. Phase I work will produce a laboratory area imager to demonstrate the technology, while Phase II will produce commercial prototype x-ray cameras and electron amplifiers.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Performance requirements for polymer matrix composites (PMCs) in aerospace and transportation applications are generally quite stringent. Among these requirements are excellent thermal stability, high strength and high toughness. Easy processing is also desirable. Electron-beam (e-beam) curing has the potential to significantly reduce the overall cost of manufacturing PMC parts for use in aerospace as well as in other applications. E-beam cure is extremely fast -- cycle times of several minutes to several hours are possible in contrast to currently employed thermal technologies, which may require several days for full cure. Additionally, part sizes and shapes are unlimited. Tooling costs are also significantly reduced since common materials such as wood may now be employed in parts fabrication. Polyimides can provide the excellent properties required for aerospace applications, but processability remains a problem; e-beam cure of polyimides has not yet been established. In this Phase I program, will investigate polyimide systems designed specifically for e-beam cure. These polyimides will be combination condensation-addition materials, based on either soluble or thermoplastic oligomeric materials or high molecular weight polyimides containing groups that can be further polymerized upon e-beam irradiation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         60770       Recycling of carbon fiber reinforced composites is an important task for the future development of this class of materials.  Without recycling, the full potential of using composite materials in low-cost applications like automobile production, along with the resulting fuel economy, will not be realized.  Recycling the composites will also have a huge ecological benefit by removing a whole class of materials from landfills.  This project will develop a low-temperature, low-pressure recycling system based on catalytic degradation of the composite matrix in a heat transfer fluid.  In Phase I, clean fibers were produced from two different classes of feedstock representing 90% of todays waste composite.  The fiber properties met market requirements for direct reuse without further processing.  Initial economic parameters showed a high degree of commercial feasibility.   In Phase II, a pilot plant will be setup to produce clean fiber on a 100-pound scale while demonstrating all unit operations of a commercial-size plant.  Additional feedstocks, expected for future automotive applications will be investigated to widen the applicability of the process and to examine possible problems associated with contaminants.              Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The recycling approach should allow a commercial operation to profitably remove a whole class of material from the wastestream for multiple life cycles, something that has not been accomplished for any polymer-based composite material.  The economic data for the process are extremely promising; an internal rate of return of over 70% is projected.",

The objective of the proposed Phase I work is to perform a feasibility study of a novel non-linear ultrasonic method for quantitative characterization of molecular bond density with the objective of determining the local bond strength.The innovation of the proposed method is to perform an ultrasonic characterization of the interface enhanced by parametric dynamic vibrations. The density of molecular bonds, described by an equivalent interfacial spring density, is quantitatively determined using dual beam ultrasonic spectroscopy at different points of the dynamic loading curve. The method permits separating the linear and non-linear behavior of the bulk adhesive and adhesive/substrate interface. Comparison between the measured spring density at tensile and compressive loads leads to a characterization of the local interfacial strength.Based on the accomplishments of Phase I, Phase II developments will be proposed including extended study of the method applicability for assessment of adhesively bonded structures and the delivery to NASA of the dedicated Angle Beam Ultrasonic Spectroscopy acquisition system for evaluation of Adhesive Joints under Parametric Excitation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In the phase I program, Advanced Ceramics Research, Inc. (ACR) fabricated in situ metallic foams by using a unique water-soluble polymer blend and ACR's Extrusion Freeform Fabrication (EFF) method. When the green parts were heated for binder burnout, thebinder was found to foam and create uniform closed, high-aspect ratio porosity. The freeform fabrication also could create open porosity ranging from 100-2000 m.  The results so far have demonstrated the capability to create low cost, in situ,metallic foams with oriented microstructures.  Since the extrusion is coupled with a freeform fabrication technique, the proposed technique can potentially yield geometrically complex metallic foam components directly from CAD files. This approach is notmaterial specific and could be used for a wide range of metals and alloys. Guidelines and procedures for optimizing the performance of metallic foams and a preliminary cost/economic analysis will be completed before the end of phase I program. Partners forcommercial and defense applications have been identified to assist ACR in commercializing the technology developed through the SBIR program. Phase II objectives include optimization of the dynamic mechanical properties of the metallic foams and fabricationof complex components for DOD and commercial partners for testing and evaluation.",

Advanced Ceramics Research, Inc. (ACR) has developed low cost, flexible-manufacturing processes for Zr & Hf-based carbon fiber reinforced composites, materials with good oxidation and ablation resistance up to 3500C. This process, called Continuous Composite Co-extrusion (C3), incorporates carbon fibers to fabricate in-situ carbide and boride-matrix/carbon fiber composites. In this Phase I program, ACR proposes an innovative solid freeform form fabrication (SFF) approach to produce Hf and Zr based ceramic composite components reinforced with continuous carbon fiber tows for critical structural components such as tubes and blisks. The process is simple, robust and will be widely applicable to a number of material systems. In this program, ACR will collaborate with Professor Jack Gillespie at the Center for Composite Materials at University of Delaware (UD), who has been a principal contributor to the development of non-autoclave curing and fabrication of polymer matrix composites. In phase I, UD will assist in fabricating 2-D composite panels at UD. ACR will perform mechanical testing and microscopy on the panels.",

Recent tests at Wright Laboratories with staged brush seals have demonstrated significantly increased blade to shroud rub tolerance of acompliant casing.  Phase I of the program is expected to demonstrate the feasibility of two innovative brush shroud designs with lower cost and weight than staged brush seals.  This will be achieved by eliminating the front and back plates of conventionalbrush seals and incorporating the compliant casing only in the forward section of the blade chord where the effect of reduced tip clearance is most significant.  Phase II will down select an optimum brush shroud design and manufacturing process by furthertesting at Wright Laboratories and establish a target life-cycle cost based on current repair costs.  Phase II will also include fabrication of a compliant shroud casing for technology demonstration in an advanced military engine program at GE AircraftEngines.",

TARDEC will research opposed-piston (OP) 2-cycle diesel engines incorporating advanced 2- and 4-cycle dieseltechnologies.  Design concepts will be evaluated by building a single cylinder research engine.  AED Corp.'s proposed design combines its extensive hardware developed HFE direct-injected controlled combustion engine technology with electronicallycontrolled common rail fuel injection, variable nozzle turbocharger, cooled articulated pistons, and high turbulent combustion chamber.  Using Detroit Diesel Corp.'s (DDC) production 2-cycle components, the engine's design will facilitate hardware changesneeded to evaluate critical design variables (i.e. crankshaft phasing).  Operating on a controlled dual combustion thermodynamic cycle limiting maximum cylinder pressure, exceptionally high power density, low fuel consumption, and low emissions arepredicted.  Phase I work has confirmed that DDC 71 & 92 series components can make up the majority of components in the mechanical engine structure.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Not Available This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a real-time, whole wafer sensor for process monitoring and fault detection in advanced semiconductor and thin film fabrication processes. The production of future semiconductor and optoelectronic devices will depend critically on continued advances in process sensing and control. In present-day manufacturing, process yield and productivity are limited by the high sensitivity of layer properties to process conditions, and by an inability to control process conditions adequately throughout the process sequence. Current technology relies primarily on open-loop control using indirect sensor signals; a costly practice resulting in significant scrap and equipment downtime for preventative maintenance. To address this problem through improved closed loop control, this project will develop a high performance imaging radiometer with advanced thermographic and wafer mapping algorithms. Phase II includes hardware, software, and applications development that addresses important components of the sensor technology for monitoring blanket and patterned substrates. The sensor will provide near video-rate, spatially resolved whole wafer measurements of temperature and film properties from a model-based analysis of thermal radiance images. In-house testing on a rapid thermal processing tool and field testing on a MOCVD reactor will be performed.  Potential commercial applications are anticipated in optimization and control of many advanced semiconductor fabrication processes such as rapid thermal processing (RTP), molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), and metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). Improved whole wafer sensors have potential for significant increase in the number of process steps performed by RTP and thus increase the RTP as a generic process method. The commercial benefits of an in-situ wafer state sensor include reduced scrap, reduced equipment preventative maintenance, improved process efficiency, and improved device uniformity and performance.",

In Phase I, Advanced Fuel Research,  Inc. (AFR) demonstrated FT-IR emission/transmission (E/T) measurements  from the NIST spray combustion facility at 7 scans/sec 1 at cm-1  resolution. Significant Phase I work designed the low noise optical system  that could be coupled to the NIST spray chamber, and as expected, the high  scan rate was successful in removing droplet/particle transit noise from  interfering in the mid-infrared spectrum. Tomographic reconstruction of  multiple lines of sight through a non-sooting spray flame provided  spatially resolved (3 mm) measurements of multiple gas species  concentrations and temperatures and initial qualitative information on  fuel spray droplets. Phase II R&D; will result in further improvements to  the optics and coupling design. Spectral resolution is to be improved to  0.5 cm-1 and spatial resolution to 2 mm. Phase II will result in delivery  NIST spray combustion facility. NIST researchers will have the capability  to non-intrusively probe and characterize the spray flame in more detail  than ever before with a single instrument for gases, droplets and soot.",

Phantom tests and volunteer      evaluations showed improved signal-to-noise of 24-28 percent over the industry       standard.                                                                                                                                                                 Phase II will involve optimizing the RF coil arrays based on a \"new design,\"         followed by extensive phantom and volunteer evaluations to achieve high              signal-to-noise over the knee, foot and wrist joints of adults.                                                                                                           A major technical focus is to improve the S/N of a NMR experiment by a factor        of sqrt (2) over the industry standards. Potential clinical and research uses        are to obtain reliable, reproducible high-resolution images needed to enhance        diagnostic accuracy in possibly reduced scan times, reducing patient discomfort      while increasing throughput in a MR scanner. This we believe will be of a            substantial benefit to mankind.                                                      PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Clinical applications include non-ionizing, non-invasive and a cost effective approach toward diagnosis of musculoskeletal diseases of the knee, foot and wrist when compared to the invasive arthrography. This project will provide improvements to MR phased array coil technology, including sequences and technique optimizations.  If clinical value is demonstrated, MR systems based technology will find widespread applications in imaging the human musculosketal system.",

This performance is at least twice as efficient as the best current state-of-the-art for smalllow-temperature crycoolers.  The proposed technical approach, whose feasibility has been investigated and confirmed in Phase I of this project, is to apply the advantageous features of large-scale cryogenic refrigerators to compact and reliable smallscalesystems by impementing a  novel therodynamic cycle in a mechanically innovation machine.  Size, cost, and complexity are reduced in the proposed concept by employing a modular design whereby each stage is of identical construction (except for expanderand heat exchanger length), and where the heat exchanger and expander are constructed as an integral unit.  The expanders are of extremely simply floating piston construction that requires no seals or mechanical power transmission devices to extract powerfrom the cold expander. Piston motion is controlled by electo-mechanically actuated",

        "abstract": "Abstract         We propose synergistically implementing two emerging ballistic materials,aluminum foams and 3-D woven polymeric composites, in theconstruction of lightweight armor with ceramic facing.  In the recentballistic studies both materials have separately demonstrated improvementsin ceramic-faced armor.  3-D woven FRP enables to reduce dynamic deflection,localize damage and increase multiple hit capability.  Aluminum foam has beenshown to reduce dynamic deflection, localize damage and attenuate shocktransmission.  Both materials are highly tailorable, particularly withrespect to through thickness properties, thus providing unique andfundamental improvements to the next generation integral armor systems.  Inthe proposed work, the most influential processing variables will be studiedon each of the materials and their assemblies in the form of ballistictargets.  Specifically, effects of various construction parameters will beassessed through the following experimental and theoretical studies: (i)static and dynamic mechanical characterization of the constituent materials,(ii) ballistic tests of the assembled targets against 20mm FSP and (iii)ballistic performance simulation using MOSAIC impact code developed by 3TEX.The result of this study will be an understanding of the influences ofessential processing variables on both the individual materials, theirsynergistic effects, and will enable to optimize armor performance.",

Even when it is pointed out that the fuel is in fact not radioactive, concerns persist. It is acknowledged that to design a reactor able to withstand all conceivable launch accidents would result in an impractical heavy design. To avoid the above problem and to put to rest any concerns, it is proposed that the reactor be launched without fuel or partially fueled to avoid any possibility of the reactor attaining criticality in the event of a launch accident. This SBIR proposal describes an innovative approach to permit the reactor to be fueled in space in a simple operation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project concerns the development and implementation of seismic imaging and inversion methods and parallel computer algorithms to estimate subsurface fluid-flow properties from time-lapse seismic data. In recent years, there has been exponential growth in time-lapse seismology project activity. These projects have yielded seismic difference anomalies that result from monitoring time-variant changes in the earth's subsurface related to fluid flow. However, such anomalies are often qualitative and ambiguous--what causes the anomalies, and what do they mean? The proposed Phase II research will enable the capability to make quantitative estimates of the 3D distribution of subsurface fluid pressure and fluid saturation changes that cause the seismic anomalies, using wave-equation seismic imaging and inversion techniques, coupled with rock physics analysis. The research consists of three parts: optimized parallel software and computational design, amplitude preserved seismic imaging and impedance inversion, and robust rock physics inversion to estimate pressure and saturation. The software and services generated by this Phase II research will be invaluable to help guide new wells and optimize reservoir management decisions in the 70+ oilfields world-wide that are being actively monitored with time-lapse seismic data. Near-term commercial applications of the proposed research include petroleum industry mapping and monitoring of commercial oil reserves, monitoring of costly injected fluids (water, steam, CO2, miscible gas), and imaging pressure compartmentalization and the leaking or sealing properties of faults and fractures. Non-petroleum applications may include monitoring groundwater reserves, near-surface monitoring of contaminant plumes and environmental clean-up projects. Potential far-market applications may include sub-sea acoustic imaging, synthetic aperture radar satellite imaging, and medical imaging",

        "abstract": "Abstract         60143         Multicomponent shear-wave seismic data reveal information about subsurface lithologies and fluid properties that is difficult or impossible to obtain with compressional-wave data alone.  Although commercially available three-dimensional (3D), multicomponent simulations handle many aspects of the 3D behavior of shear waves in complex media, there are serious gaps.  In particular, steps to ensure vector fidelity, separation of P and S wave fields, and correlation between P- and S-wave events are often neglected; consequently, converted-wave imaging may not be performed as efficiently and accurately as required.   This project will develop new tools to fill the gaps in commercially available flow simulations for processing 3D multicomponent data.  Phase I investigated and prototyped four novel approaches:  (1) surface-consistent multicomponent amplitude balancing and vector fidelity, (2) vector wavefield separation, (3) prestack converted-wave imaging algorithm in both the time and depth domains on parallelized computer architectures, and (4) cross-correlation of P- and S-wave events and spatial adjustment of the converted-wave section in time or depth to conform to that of the P-wave section.  In Phase II, a 3D multicomponent processing package will be developed, integrating the tools developed in Phase I.   Phase II will include comprehensive testing of the individual processing algorithms using synthetic seismic data as well as field seismic data.                     Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The novel methods described in this proposal should improve imaging of hydrocarbon reservoirs and thereby increase domestic oil and gas assets in those areas where multicomponent data have been acquired.  The multicomponent processing software can be marketed to major oil companies and smaller independents as well as to seismic contractors.",

In Phase I, approaches were defined for developing technology to improve CT inspectioncapabilities.  In Phase II, the technology will be developed and incorporated in practical tools to be delivered to OO-ALC at Hill AFB, where Air Force missile SRMs are inspected.  Improvements will be made in the acquisition, analysis and visualization ofCT data.  A suite of statistical analysis tools will provide capabilities to quantitatively characterize, analyze, and compare CT data from one or more SRMs.  The volume visualization toolkit will create realistic three-dimensional images of features, suchas flaws and aging effects.  Tele-CT capabilities for network collaboration will enable Hill AFB engineers to easily share CT data and consult with other experts on the interpretation and evaluation of CT inspection results.  Successful completion of thisPhase II project will improve Air Force capabilities to detect features in an SRM with CT inspection and to evaluate the effect of these features on SRM integrity.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This is a proposal for the fabrication and testing of an Advanced Discrimination Ladar Receiver (ADLR) and its associated 3-D imaging system.  A time-slicing technology is incorporated in each pixel of a two-dimensional array.  When a laser pulse returnsfrom one or more objects, a high-range-resolution 3-D image is produced from the captured data.  The ADLR concept is based upon state-of-the-art integrated circuits and image tube technology.  The concept is very innovative with enormous potential forincreasing performance above existing multiple-independent-channel, discrimination-ladar-receiver designs used for reentry vehicle and decoy discrimination.  Phase I test data shows the range resolution of the current-technology ADLR is 20cm.  The spatialresolution is, for practical purposes, limited only by chip size; 230 x 230 pixels are possible.  The Phase II ADLR will have at least twice the range resolution as the current technolgy.  Data is multiplexed off the ADLR sensor between laser pulses and sothe receiver is not limited by real-time, multiple-independent-channel processing.  A 12-bit digitizer can easily be used at the output of the sensor; whereas other real-time designs are limited to far fewer bits.  There are also substantial reductions inweight, size, power consumption and cost over conventional receiver approaches.  The most direct commercial application of a successful Phase II demonstration will be the incorporation of the ADLR technology in both atmospheric and underwater imagingsystems by at leaast two well-know companies.  Additional benefits include:a 3-D ladar, target-discrimination, missile or target seeker; a human or machine visual aid to see through net camouflage and fould weather; a 3-D, eye-safe, imaging system forcivilian aircraft and road vehicles; a 3-D streak camera.",

However, the highly reflective substrates require reduction of this reflectivity to minimize standing waves and to maintain tightdimensional control.

Unfortunately, spin coating is not a conformal coating and tends to planarize complex geometries, essentially filling in theholes and rounding the features.  This results in erosin of feature sidewalls and loss of dimensional integrity.  The industry requires a new process for application of ARCs which is highly conformal, has low defect density and is equally applicable tosubstrates up to 12",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Applicant's Abstract) The Mouse is the species        of choice for many neuroscientists because of well-characterized molecular           biology and chemistry of its brain, the recent widespread use of transgenic and      knockout techniques, and the low cost and rapid breeding of the animal. Mice         will become more important upon completion of the sequencing of the mouse            genome. In 1994, Advanced Targeting Systems commercialized 192-Saporin, a            reagent that causes death of cholinergic basal forebrain (CBF) neurons in the        rat. A major detriment to the reagent is its lack of activity in the mouse. In       our Phase I work, we created an agent that removes CBF neurons in the mouse          without affecting other neurons or systems. In Phase II, it is proposed to           characterize this lesioning agent and to demonstrate its usefulness as a             reagent for modeling and studying neurodegenerative diseases such as                 Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is a common, devastating neurodegenerative              disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline. Loss of cholinergic         innervation occurs frequently and severely in patients with AD. The degree of        cognitive decline has been correlated to the extent of cholinergic degeneration      in the neocortex and loss of cholinergic neurons from CBF.     PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The primary market for a mouse p75-Saporin immunotoxin includes scientists in both  academic and pharmaceutical laboratories who are involved in the study of Alzheimer's  disease (AD) and other disorders of the brain. These researchers are studying neuronal controls, behavior and/or treatments that affect a wide population suffering from  AD. The new mouse-specific immunotxin described in this application will be key  in the discovery process because the mouse is the only other mammal, besides  humans, scheduled for complete genetic sequencing. Another important asset  of a mouse-specific research tool is the ability of the researcher to combine  their use with transgenic models.",

Our experiments using a TA&T; ceramic microchannel module validated outanalytical model of heat transfer in a microchannel.  In Phase II, we will be optimizing both the microchannel geometry and the formulations of the ceramic paste to produce a high flux microchannel device with heat removal capacity in the range of 100W/cm2 or higher.  The addition of EHD electrodes to the channels will provide additional heat flux capability and active control of the heat transfer rates.  TA&T; is in the process of installing state-of-the-art, automated fabrication equipment that willincrease dimensional accuracy,  allow the building of larger modules, and simplify the deposition of ceramic electrode pastes.  Our ceramic-base microchannel heat sink device will be light-weight, low-cost, and will have sufficient heat flux capacity forcooling power electronics.  Our goal is to develop and test a complete heat removal system that will allow direct integration of a thermal management system into the design of smart power electronic components.  For example, heat pipes, which are thecurrent state-of-the-art cooling technology for electronic components in satellites, are limited to heat fluxes of about 50 W/cm2.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Advanced Thermal and Environmental Concepts, Inc. proposes to utilize electrohydrodynamic (EHD) technology to reduce the amount of frost that forms on cold plates in food freezers. The defrost cycle consumes about 5-15% of the energy to operate an industrial food freezer. During Phase I of our project, we used EHD technology to reduce frost mass by 35% and frost height by as mush as 65% under certain conditions. In order to reduce frost formation with EHD technology to an even greater extent, we will optimize further the EHD electrode design and configuration and applied voltage waveforms. Our proposal includes a plan for an on-line measurement system to provide reliable data in an accelerated manner. We will conduct several long-term tests in order to select among the most promising electrode configurations and the performance of this selected electrode will then be more fully quantified and evaluated. Finally, a prototype frost-free freezer, installed with the selected electrode, will be designed, fabricated and tested. Approximately 24 months are required to complete Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant): The long-term objective of this proposal        is to generate a cartilage product with mechanical properties comparable to          those of adult articular cartilage for the repair of focal articular defects.        Based on previous experimental findings, our hypothesis is that mechanical           loading will improve the growth of tissue engineered cartilage in vitro,             resulting in a cartilage product with biochemical and biomechanical properties       similar to those of articular cartilage. Such tissues are expected to withstand      the mechanical forces experienced in vivo better than currently available            products, increasing the probability of a successful surgical outcome. To this       end, the proposed specific aims of this proposal are as follows:                                                                                                          Aim 1: Further develop a novel in house uniaxial compression-perfusion               bioreactor system designed and used in the SBIR Phase I into a modular, closed,      long-term culture system that supports mechanical modulation and testing of          tissues.                                                                                                                                                                  Aim 2: Determine a culture regime (which will include mechanical loading at          specified amplitudes, frequencies, and cycles, as well as perfusion) which           results in cartilage constructs with biomechanical and biochemical properties        comparable to those of adult articular cartilage.                                                                                                                         Aim 3: Determine the ability of allogeneic tissue engineered cartilage               constructs to successfully repair focal defects on the condylar surface of the       patellofemoral joint.    PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Tissue engineering of cartilage in vitro, followed by transplantation for human  therapy of articular surface defects.",

This effort builds on the success of the Phase I effortwhere it was shown that an array of electro-optic waveguides in Potassium Titanyl Phosphate (KTP) could be used for phase control. The low-voltage device can control the phase of each laser beam utilizing individually addressable waveguides that areseparated from each other by 250 mm. A phase front sensor will be used to provide a feedback system for coherent addition of the output laser beams. The completed device will be connectorized so components such as high-power fiber amplifiers can be easilyinserted or replaced. Because multiple phased array modules can be cascaded and operated in parallel, the technology is highly scalable. Additionally, the KTP waveguides are transparent across a spectral range from 350 nm to 4500 nm, allowing thistechnology to be used for the generation of high-power laser beams at numerous wavelengths using currently available laser amplifiers. This will enable or improve high-power laser applications for the military, medical, laser machining, and scientificcommunities.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         60765        Current designs for electric motors use a housing that acts as both a structural support and as a method of cooling the stator and rotor.  This approach to cooling is not as effective as possible because heat must flow from the rotor and stator through the housing to the cooling media.  Because the housing must contain the coolant, it is also larger, heavier, and more expensive than necessary.  This project will develop a motor that uses a direct lamination cooling (DLC) system, passing coolant directly through the stator and eliminating the need for bulky housing, thereby improving heat transfer.  Motor size could be reduced by up to 30-40%, mass by up to 20-30%, and cost by up to 30%.  Phase I demonstrated that reliable lamination-to-lamination seals and reliable stack-to-manifold seals can be achieved using the methods identified.  The addition of the selected sealants adds only slightly to the thermal resistance and pressure drop compared with unsealed counterparts.  Phase II will build electric motors and inductors using the DLC method, obtain comparative performance data on the effectiveness of the method, and then obtain operational use data on these components through long term testing in a representative environment.  The long-term testing will ensure that real world aspects of motor and inductor operation (including vibration, temperature cycling , and the presence of electrical and magnetic fields) do not degrade the seals such that leaking occurs or that the thermal performance degrades.               Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The DLC method should reduce the cost and increase the power density and specific power of electric motors and inductors/transformers thereby increasing the market penetration for these systems",

We will identify principal material (fiber) directions and density profiles about naturally occurring holes in bones through a microscopic and radiographic techniques. These holes are known to be damage tolerant, as they clinically do not represent a fracture or fatigue failure initiation site. In addition to its novel microstructure, bone is also a 2 fiber composite material, consisting of stiff bone mineral crystals embedded in a scaffold of compliant collagen fibers. We will demonstrate the expected low stress concentrations about the hole through mechanical testing and moir interferometry. We will then incorporate these principal material directions and density and use a 2 fiber system in a computational model of a representative airframe panel. This model will be used to demonstrate the advantages of biomimetic design. We believe biomimetic design principles can be used to reduce aircraft weight, as bones are weight optimized due to the energy expenditure required to carry such a relatively heavy tissue. Furthermore, by increasing damage tolerance, life cycle costs of airframes can be reduced significantly.",

We will develop and demonstrate a new means of combining the light from two or more diode lasers into a single analysis beam. This will enable a multiplication of the number of chemical species which are simultaneously measured. The type of beam multiplexing technique which we intend to investigate has not been previously demonstrated in a TDL system. This type of measurement system will serve the needs of quantifying aircraft exhaust in several ways. The simultaneous measurement of minor constituents and either CO2 or H2O allows the determination of an emission index for the minor species. A greater number of simultaneous concentration measurements allows a better understanding of the basic chemistry of the combustion process and will enable development of engine systems with reduced emissions. The proposed technology can enhance existing TDL systems, including two currently used by NASA in combustion emissions studies, and others in use in atmospheric applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         60520         The atmospheric abundance of carbon dioxide and methane have increased dramatically during the industrial era.  Since these increases can perturb the global climate, it is vital to understand and quantify the factors controlling them.  This is difficult because CO2 and CH4 have a wide range of complex surface sources and sinks, which have both natural and anthropogenic components.  However, since the sources (and sinks) produce (and remove) the isotopic forms of these species at varying rates, atmospheric measurements of the isotopic composition of the carbon cycle gases provide a powerful tool for quantifying their sources and sinks.   Most measurements are currently performed with large, expensive mass spectrometers using complex and time consuming analytical methods.  This project will develop a compact, deployable, easy to use isotopic monitor using Tunable Infrared Laser Differential Absorption Spectroscopy (TILDAS).   During Phase I, a novel optical design was demonstrated for isotope measurements, and isotopic ratios with precisions as small as 0.2% were obtained with a very simple instrument.  The optical design compensates for the large difference in concentration between major and minor isotopes by measuring them with vastly differing path lengths within the same multipass cell.  An infrared difference frequency source was also designed, and it was shown that using a built-up cavity to produce the difference frequency radiation would increase output power by a factor of 40.   Phase II will design and build a prototype isotopic monitor for CO2 and CH4.   The infrared source will be produced using a build-up cavity to produce sufficient power and will be widely tunable in frequency.  The source will be integrated into a prototype isotopic monitor which employs the novel optical and signal processing methods.  Finally, standard isotopic gas samples will be tested to validate the instruments performance.                        Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The instrument should compete with existing mass spectrometric isotope instruments which are expensive, large, and relatively slow.  In addition, the infrared source should have application to the measurement of many other gas species and also should have wide application in atmospheric monitoring, industrial process control, and medical research.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         60921       Although there are large uncertainties in the quantification of aerosol particles, they have important effects on visibility, acid deposition, climate, and human health.  Organic compounds, generated from energy related activities, are known to constitute a large fraction of the ambient aerosol mass in many locations.  The quantification of these compounds is hindered by the lack of real-time, size-resolved, quantitative instruments for the measurement of the chemical composition of organic aerosols.  Especially needed are instruments with the size, weight, ruggedness, and time resolution required aboard research aircraft.  This project will utilize an innovative aerosol mass spectrometer for size-resolved, quantitative chemical composition data on aerosol particles.  The instrument will be upgraded for aircraft deployment, and improvements in organic composition analysis, particle shape measurement, and particle counting will be added.  In Phase I, the response of the aerosol mass spectrometer to organic aerosols was demonstrated in two field campaigns and in laboratory experiments.  The analysis of organic aerosol data was improved and quantified.  An aerosol inlet for aircraft sampling was designed, and design specifications for an aircraft compatible instrument were completed.  In Phase II, the aircraft deployable aerosol mass spectrometer will be constructed, and the aerosol inlet will be built and tested.  Both will be installed on a Department of Energy research aircraft and tested.                   Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: Because of the breadth of species potentially accessible with mass spectrometry, an autonomous, light weight aerosol mass spectrometer instrument should provide aerosol measurement capabilities for atmospheric research, ambient pollution monitoring, chemical and biological warfare agent identification, and explosives/buried munitions detection.  It should also have applicability to a variety of production processes, including semiconductor manufacturing tools, gas turbines, fluidized bed combustors, diesel combustors and conventional furnaces used for electrical power, thermal energy and propulsion applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Prevention of catastrophic failure of engine components is a major goal to the subtopic. Catastrophic failures of turbine engines are often caused by vibration-induced compressor and fan blade fatigue fractures. Existing capacitance systems have been unable to accurately measure blade vibration due to limited spatial resolution and limited system bandwidth. The proposed effort will develop a new capacitive system with significantly higher spatial resolution and wider bandwidth to provide high-accuracy time-of-arrival measurements for computing blade vibration. Successful demonstration of feasibility of the capacitive probe and electronics will lead to development of monitoring systems suitable for use on new engines as well as for retrofit on existing engines. The ability to detect excessibe blade vibration in flight will allow the pilot to change the engine operating parameters and thus prevent the occurrence of safety-significant blade fractures.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         New results on false alarm characteristics from our research show that an estimate of a contact's effective target strength could be used as a very reliable classifier for near specular submarine detections.  Exploiting this would require that theprocessing system be able to adaptively estimate transmission loss from source or receiver to an arbitrary position prior to classification.  Initial indications are that an accuracy of  10 dB in transmission loss would be more than adequate to classifyeven the smallest of submarines. Since accuracy better than this has been achieved in the past, we believe this approach has a good possibility of succeeding with an integrated network of sensors.The proposed classification concept is that the sonobuoys would collect unclipped direct arrival information using attenuated hydrophones.  This information, along with other information characterizing potential contacts, would be transmitted to theaircraft at a low data rate. An aircraft based processor would then assemble all the data from the sonobuoy network, adaptively compute a global transmission loss model for the area, and classify contacts based on their consistency with the target strengthmodel.",

We are proposing innovative enhancements to the technology embodiedin the Army standard mine detecting unit AN/PSS-12 that will lead the development of an affordable device that can precisely locate and discriminate between mines and clutter.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The occurrence of causative agents such as Cryptosporidium parvum and other pathogens in water supplies presents a critical issue. Transmitted through water and animals, these organisms provide a reservoir of infection, which results in the excretion of the environmentally stable cysts or oocysts that are impervious to inactivation by many drinking water disinfectants. Cryptosporidium infections are particularly problematic for immuno-compromised individuals because drug therapy to control or eliminate this organism from a human host is not yet available. The method currently used for detection of these pathogenic microorganisms at the water source is not only laborious and time consuming, but often inefficient in accurately recovering and identifying waterborne pathogens. Various alternative technologies have been investigated; however, none to date have been able to provide the possibility of rapid, sensitive, and low-cost field testing. The use of nucleic acid based detection technologies, such as DNA probes, provides the greatest potential for highly specific and sensitive detection of potentially hazardous biological agents. The most promising approach to developing the ideal biosensor is microfabrication of identification systems that mimic diagnostic schemes utilized in microbiology laboratories to detect and identify specific microbial agents. Although there is much activity in this area, most efforts suffer from the inability to properly marry microfabrication technology with the molecular biology required for sensitive and specific detection.",

The Department of Defense has a requirement to ensure survivability of important military C3 and weaponssystems against the effects of electromagnetic weapons threats.  What is needed is an electromagnetic hardening technology that is lightweight yet offers high shielding effectiveness and can be integrated into the system design, is low-cost,field-expedient, and transparent to the user.  Transient liquid phase sintered (TLPS) conductive inks, now emerging as a low-cost approach to fabrication of printed wire boards, will fit all of these requirements if low-cost application methods, reducedsure/sinter temperatures and improved electromagnetic shielding properties can be achieved.  TLPS inks comprise a combination of polymers and metal powders that fuse together at low temperatures to form a continuous metallic layer that bonds to commonsubstrate materials.  The objective of this proposed efforts is to develop a spray-applied electromagnetic paint-shield with superior shielding effectiveness that sinters and cures at temperature well below those of current TLPS inks.  This conductivepaint will allow low-cost shielding to be applied to just about any electronic device.  The emergence of high-speed-information products is creating a need for new EMI shielding technologies that can be incorporated as part of the design of the tinypackages now emerging.  What is needed is a method of shielding a digital or a RF signal from one point on a printed circuit to another.  If a low-temperature cured, spray applied TLPS paint can be made, it will revolutionize the shielding of electronicsfor commercial and defense applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Recent advances in electromagnetic technology clearly lend themselves to application in space-based data storage/retrieval systems. Commercial data storage systems provide low cost, long-life operation and strong logic/control systems, but employmechanical bearings that limit their resistance to shock and life expectancy. A similar system ruggedized for space via integrated magnetic motor-bearing technology and combined with a flexible control interface system to handle format conversions wouldoffer dramatic improvement in on-board space systems.The vacuum and temperature extremes of space provide significant technical challenges to mechanical bearings, which are completely unable to provide any vibration isolation to sensitive read/write heads or optics. This proposal will prove that bearingfunctions can be coupled with motor functions in single electromagnetic devices that exhibit longer life with no maintenance at a lower cost. Additional benefits include significant improvement in disk drive system performance, lower weight and vibrationisolation potential that does not exist in other technologies.Airex Corporation has, in recent SBIR efforts, demonstrated the viability of integral motor-bearing technology. Airex has also shown that integral motor-bearings point the way to highly reliable, low power, lubricant free, and long life motion platforms.Such functional sophistication can expand performance in commercial or military space-borne platforms.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         60275      Preliminary designs for the next generation of high energy physics colliders will require much higher magnetic field levels for successful operation.  Currently available superconducting materials are either unable to reach these levels (NbTi) or they are much too expensive (Nb3Sn, Nb3Al and HiTcSC).  This project addresses the design and manufacture of Nb3Sn superconducting wire that holds promise for both better performance (3000 A/mm2 at 4.2K and 12T) and lower cost ($1.50/kA-m at 4.2K and 12T).  The proposed architecture is a hybrid that includes features from both the Modified Jelly Roll (MJR) and Tin Infiltrated Niobium Sponge (TINS) methods.  The niobium will be in the form of an expanded sheet, like the MJR, but the tin will be distributed uniformly across the cross-section, like TINS.  This approach substantially increases the amount of niobium in the non-copper cross-section and will increase the amount of Nb3Sn in the completed conductor, which leads to an increased Jc value.  Phase I demonstrated that the Modified Jelly Roll/Distributed Tin (MJR/DT) structure can be extruded, under certain circumstances.  Preliminary design considerations for hydrostatic extrusion and drawing facilities were developed.  Phase II will determine the best approach for mechanically stabilizing the structures so they can be successfully processed to wire.  In addition, the existing hydrostatic extrusion facilities will be modified to include small half-angle dies, so the range of sound flow can be increased.  Wire samples will be heat treated to find the optimum processing steps.  Using these results, a series of billets will be processed, and approximately 1,000 foot samples will be produced.                      Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: A high performance, relatively low cost A-15 material would be an enabling development for the use of high magnetic fields.  Applications include high energy physics and energy storage.  Also, the manufacturing techniques developed in this project could provide new methods for processing difficult materials",

There is a need to track down America's millions of HBV victims-as         well as a corresponding need for innovative technology to test blood for HBV.        HBV is clearly a national medical priority.                                                                                                                               The overall goal of this project is to further develop and then integrate core       sensor and enzyme immunoassay technologies into a novel technique for the rapid      and accurate measurement of HBV levels in blood. We are targeting diagnostic         (detection) applications as well as quantitative measurement needs (to monitor       viral levels and treatment efficacy). The feasibility of our approach was            clearly demonstrated during Phase I. The Phase II goal is to                         demonstrate/validate/optimize the integration of a unique electrochemical            measurement method with proprietary electrochemical enzyme immunoassay               architecture to produce a new diagnostic/monitoring capability for \"real time,\"      cost-effective HBV assessment in an outpatient setting.

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Identifying the roles of variable               individual genetic factors can revolutionize approaches to the diagnosis,            treatment, and prevention of human disease. Single nucleotide polymorphisms          (SNPs) are the most frequent DNA sequence variations that affect human health,       and better methods for scoring known SNPs in the human population are needed.        This SBIR project is designed to develop a sensitive, high-throughput,               efficient and affordable method of scoring known SNPs. Phase I work and              subsequent interim efforts have clearly established the feasibility of our           approach. The overall project goal is to develop an advanced electrochemical,        peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probe-based array system that can rapidly and             reliably measure SNPs. The electrochemical arrays will be developed within the       standard microtiter plate format, allowing researchers the ability to adapt          their existing automation instrumentation to this more-efficient                     electrochemical platform.                                                                                                                                                 This expanded, 3-year Phase II project will lead to 1) development of specific       PNA-based electrochemical sensor assays for the identification/quantification        of known SNP sequences; 2) design/fabrication of innovative sensor arrays and        appropriate array-reader instrumentation for high-throughput, accurate,              easy-to-use, and inexpensive SNPs scoring in human genomic samples; and 3)           demonstration, through collaborative studies, of the utility of this approach        to SNPs scoring for use by researchers and clinicians. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The new SNP  scoring system proposed here is rounded on a versatile, automated chip-based system for probe analysis of DNA or RNA. It will serve as a companion instrument to PCR as well as a new tool for direct nucleic acid analysis. The laboratory market for PCR is currently $300 million per year. Our PCR related system would represent a significant new, complementary product in this marketplace. Furthermore, as the clinical market matures, we anticipate a range of diagnostic applications that will increase the opportunities for the instrument.",

The targeted identification responsetime is less than 5 minutes.

        "abstract": "Abstract         60344         The identification of fast, bright scintillators is a continual goal among scientists who design and manufacture radiation detection systems.  Unfortunately, the scintillator is often the limiting technology that impedes product development and adds substantial cost.  Many materials have been tried, but few can deliver both qualities.  The two approaches are (1) making small incremental improvements in common scintillators or (2) studying new materials that offer greater potential.  This project addresses the second route and will examine rubidium gadolinium bromide (RGB) as a versatile gamma ray and neutron sensitive detector material for a variety of scientific, industrial, and medical applications.  In Phase I, several ingots of RGB were grown with differing concentrations of an activator (to stimulate light output).  Single crystals, far larger than previously reported, were produced and analyzed as detectors.  Both speed and light output were exemplary, with several high quality spectra recorded.  The Phase II goals for producing RGB will be to increase scintillator size and optimize activator concentration.  Following processing, the scintillator will be evaluated as both a gamma ray and a neutron detector.                           Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: As a gamma ray scintillator, RGB would find use in nuclear and radiological physics as an alternative to NaI or similar scintillators where large volumes and fast timing requirements are needed.  As a neutron detector, RGB could lead to a variety of new instruments for material science, neutron radiography, and nuclear security.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A critically important region of the electromagnetic spectrum is the hard X-ray/soft gamma-ray band from 10 KeV to a few MeVs. In this band, a wealth of astrophysical processes occur in an even greater diversity of astrophysical objects and phenomena, both on a compact and diffuse scale. Surprisingly, for such a pivotal region of the spectrum, the high energy sky is still quite unexplored in that the number of sources detected is still too small to allow a comprehensive study of the various phenomena involved. An instrument used for planetary scientific investigations is an X-ray/ gamma-ray spectrometer; it must be lightweight, stable, reliable, rugged, and long-lived. Radiation Monitoring Devices, Inc. (RMD) proposes to develop an innovative detector with a matrix of CsI(Tl) scintillators coupled to an array of avalanche photodiodes (APDs). Such a detector can be integrated into an imaging spectrometer to achieve improved angular resolution using a shadow-casting technique with the use of one or two-coded apertures. The improved angular resolution in the hard X-ray and gamma-ray regime will enable the studying of spatial and temporal development of solar flares, repeating gamma-ray bursters, and hard X-ray transients.",

While ICCDs are capable of single photon sensitivity with nanosecond time resolution via detector gating, performance is limited by the photocathode quantum efficiencies of <15% in the UV and <20% visible to near IR. This project will develop a solid state version of gated ICCDs; namely, high performance Avalanche Photodiode (APD) arrays will be used to develop a linear APD array module with single photon sensitivity, high quantum efficiency (30-80% for wavelengths between 300-700 nm), and gated modes of operation.  Phase I experimentally demonstrated the key components of the linear APD array module:  high efficiency single photon detection at liquid nitrogen temperatures was demonstrated, several linear APD arrays that exhibited excellent gain and noise characteristics were fabricated,  and an innovative solution for the gated integrator preamplifier was developed.  In Phase II, the linear APD fabrication techniques will be further refined to produce an optimal 1 x 64 element array, optimized for low noise and single photon detection efficiency.  Likewise, the preamplifier electronics and readout will be optimized, and a 64-channel data acquisition system will be completed.  The data acquisition system, linear APD array, and a liquid nitrogen dewar will be integrated in a prototype module.  This module will be coupled to a spectrometer, fully characterized, and compared to gated ICCDs.                       Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The linear APD detector array module should significantly increase the sensitivity of time-resolved optical spectroscopy applications.

        "abstract": "Abstract         60615       High energy physics is replete with complex detector systems that record interaction positions, energy deposition, and timing information from thousands of individual elements.  Fiber optic tracking is a potentially simpler and less expensive method for large volume detectors that use conventional photomultiplier tubes coupled to scintillators.  The key technology that needs to be linked to these trackers is a compact, high density photodetector that can provide sufficient readout of low light signals.   This project will adapt a benchmark avalanche photodiode (APD) technology to the precise requirements found only in high energy physics.  To accomplish this, small, sub-millimeter pixilated arrays must be fabricated, radiation hardness must be improved, lower noise thresholds must be reached, and quantum efficiency must be maximized.  The planar processed APD arrays produced in Phase I met or exceeded all expectations.  Multielement APD arrays with small pixels (< 1mm2) were couple to fibers and evaluated for gain, noise, cross-talk, and detection efficiency.   Crucial tests of radiation hardness validated that the arrays can withstand fluences of 1012 n/cm2 without degradation.  Phase II will produce larger arrays, integrate packaging, continue the evaluation of radiation hardness, and add pulse processing electronics.  A prototype system to more fully demonstrate the technology will be designed.                         Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: Combined fiber optic/APD detectors will largely remain in the realm of high energy physics, but many more applications are available for the APD arrays themselves.  As radiation detectors (and combined with scintillators), position sensitive APDs should find use in other scientific disciplines and in medical imaging.  As purely optical detectors, the low light levels that APDs can record make them an attractive alternative to photomultiplier tubes in a whole host of photonic devices (LIDAR, LADAR, spectrometers, etc.)",

In the Phase I effort, selected C-C composite materials were modified and tested for both high-speed bearing cage andslip ring/ brush applications under simulated space environments. 2D C-C cage materials were modified to reduce its pore size for lubricant retention. Friction tests revealed comparable frictional coefficient between modified C-C and cotton-phenolicbaseline. 3D C-C was selected for initial brush test based on its isotropic properties. Samples were further metal (silver and copper) impregnated to improve their performances. Frictional coefficient and electrical resistance were measured. C-C basedbrushes exhibited promising results when compared to the performance of Ag-MoS2 baseline.In Phase II, we propose to further optimize C-C based materials for both cage and brush applications. In addition to fine-tune the C-C composite, lubricants will be added to the base composite via filler, coating and material conversion. Prototype cageswill be fabricated and tested for both gyroscope (government) and X-ray Scanner (commercial) applications. Slip Ring brushes will also be fabricated and tested against silver ring using real hardware for both power and signal transmissions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The current antennas of choice for earth stations are parabolic reflector antennas such as those used for tracking telemetry and control (TT&C;) for the AFSCN.  These antennas are required to have horizon-to-horizon, full-hemispherical coverage and oftenseveral antennas are required at each remote tracking station site.  A single active hemispherical phased array antenna composed of flat panel subarrays could replace all the reflector antennas at a remote tracking station site.  The objectives of thisSBIR effort are to complete development of and demonstrate the technical feasibility of a low-cost beamforming network (BFN) with integrated radiating elements that will meet the requirements for TT&C; in satellite control operations.  The feed network isresponsible for RF power distribution to/from individual transmit/receive (T/R) modules and it must accommodate multiple transmit and receive beams with full duplex operation.  The radiating elements must support dual-polarized full-duplex operation.Alpha Omega Electromagnetics, LLC (AOE) will employ proprietary electromagnetic simulation software to complete detail designs of the BFN and high performance radiating elements developed during Phase I of this and a related SBIR effort.  The resultingdesigns will be based on low-cost high-performance configurations and will be validated through fabrication and test of an integrated BFN/radiating aperture passive subarray.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Missions for Special Operations Forces (SOF) are distinctive in their heavy joint service participation, their strict timing constraints, and their peculiar equipment requirements.  Lift support planning for multiple SOF missions requires flexible assetscheduling, intelligent asset tracking and routing, and multiple-resource problem-solving.  Fully automated planning, though, is inefficient and inappropriate for exploring all the options for meeting lift commitments.In Phase I, we explored a knowledge-based approach for modeling the unique aspects of the SOF IML planning domain, representing SOF lift plans as interval-based dynamic constraint networks and developing a novel mixed-initiative planning process togenerate consistent and complete lift plans.In Phase II, ALPHATECH proposes to implement a mixed-initiative planner that facilitates plan synthesis, evaluation, and repair.  This planner will intelligently guide the user through plan synthesis by filtering out inconsistent planning options.  Bytransforming partial plans into a dynamic constraint network, based on our constraint-based interval representation of the problem domain, the software can reason about temporal and metric resource constraints during continually evolving plan development.We will use path-consistency algorithms on the constraint network to detect flawed partial plans, and heuristically propose possible repairs and alternate plans.",

An accurate and robust registration capability is a requirement formany FOPEN automatic target detection algorithms including coherent change detection, multi-look detection, and multi-sensor terrain delimitation/context integration.  In Phase II, we will develop new registration algorithms and demonstrate theireffectiveness to improve the performance of existing FOPEN ATD/C algorithms.  We will measure performance as a function of registration accuracy. We have designed our program to leverage and extend a registration architecture developed in ongoing programsat ALPHATECH and will couple this architecture with our understanding of UHF and VHF phenomenology. Within this architecture we propose to assemble a suite of algorithms that includes geocoding using Digital Elevation Maps, pixel matching (correlation andmutual information), feature matching, and the simultaneous registration of multiple images and creation/modification of a Digital Elevation Map. The image products that will be registered under this effort include VHF imagery, UHF imagery, X-Band imagery,and orthophotos from the Keystone '97 experiment and other imagery, e.g., FOPEN ATD imagery, provided by the government.",

Heterogeneous components can be encapsulated so that they can inter-operate through a set of common APIs and a shared definitionof a common domain of interest. The resulting system, called the Java Trans-Knowledge Toolkit (jTKT), will build upon, extend, and will be interoperable with the existing Adaptive Sensor Fusion (ASF) architecture by incorporating Java based technologies.The jTKT system will be fully interoperable with ASF. We will extend the persistence capabilities of the combined jTKT/ASF system with: a) Support for an effective query mechanism for generic transport data b) Support for commercial relational databases c)Use of JavaSpacesT technology as a distributed persistence mechanism. Furthermore, we propose to implement the ASF publish/subscribe mechanism in terms of both JavaSpacesT and CORBA along with appropriate performance metrics to quantify system performance.In addition, jTKT will have the capability to seamlessly integrate with the Internet for data access and system control. The overall goal of this SBIR is to make the system more widely applicable by supporting multiple persistence and communicationsstrategies and to make further substantial progress toward the JBI vision.",

The main detection principle is based on new sensing approach employing thinfilms of molecular aggregates and the effect of energy migration for amplification of the fluorescence reponse signal.  In Phase I of this project we studied the luminescence compounds and demonstrated that thin films of porphyrin based aggregates exhibitquite specific signal response to different kinds of target molecules.  It has been found that energy migration in the aggregate films provides additional signal amplification due to antenna effect and increases sensitvity to the analyte vapors.  These newfings can considerably improve the sensor performance.  Since the tested material exhibits high selectivity to the  analyte vapors and the proposed new detecting scheme provides the possibilty of simultaneous processing of several parameters, the sensorarray may contain only a few sensing elements.  This simplifies the entire system and makes it very cost efficient.  In Phase II of the project a prototype sensor system will be designed, assembled, optimized and field tested with final product deliveredto DoD.  The inherent flexibilty of the sensor array allows simple reorienting and tuning its sensing functions to different groups of VOC or toxic gases including such important chemical warfare agents as Sarin, Soman and others.  The fiber opticalimplementaion of the sensor system is important for remote control the large contaminated areas without any risk for operating personnel.

The selective processing of the semiconductor materials employs a novel process of modification assisted by illumination of the semiconductor with a laser beam.  In Phase I of the project we investigated such semiconductor materials asGaAs and InP, and demonstrated that the process of modification changes chemical composition in the near-surface region of the material and eventually creates nanoclusters (quantum dots) in the semiconductor dramatically changing its electromagneticproperties, refractive index and adjusting bandgap.  In phase II of the project the demonstrated modification technology will be optimized and applied to fabrication of basic semiconductor-based components critical for monolithic integration ofoptoelectronic device.  The large index change can be employed for fabrication of a broad class of semiconductor-based active or passive components using simple direct laser beam writing.  These components include relief-free waveguide structures,micoresonators, diffractive grating and diffractive optical elements with high index contrast.  The grating having period of the order of wavelength and sufficiently large index contrast may exhibit photonic bandgap structure, resulting in new photoniccrystals with unique properties.  In addition to immediate military applications, the proposed technology is an excellent candidate for fabrication of different photonic and diffractive optical products in several markets, including: opticalcommunicaitons, WDM and signal processing, diffractive grating, computer generated holograms, spatial light modulators, diode lasers, photonic bandgap structures, thin film photvoltaic devices, etc.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Mitigation of Single Event Upset (SEU) to electronic devices and components has traditionally been and expensive problem to overcome.  Dramatic improvements in electronics technology have rendered many prior SEU solutions ineffective and have created theneed for more advanced and innovative design tools.  One of the more promising SEU solutions has been triple modular redundancy (TMR), where each processing and control circuit path is tripled and voted, such that when the outputs of the three circuitpaths are not the same, assuming single failure, the odd circuit is disregarded.  Through an algorithmic approach, the same results can be obtained with single circuits by reusing idle clock cycles.  Such an approach is far more economical, and morereliable, became there is no need to triple the circuit.  Except for a small increase in area and power, a radiation hardened circuit can be produced for the same cost, area and power as a non rad-hard commercial component.  The feasibility of developing atool named ART (Automatic Reconfiguration Tool) to create Virtual Redundancy in circuits was proven during Phase I, which included a demonstration at Space and Missile Defense Command in Huntsville, Alabama on September 12, 2000.  Improve reliability andradiation tolerance of electronic devices efficiently through automated circuit reconfiguration in design phase.  Specifically, the program will create a tool able to modify a completed design to add tolerance even to Single Event Upsets(SEU), theradiation effect which eludes most hardening techniques.  The concept allows a completed design to be reconfigured with minimal added overhead to provide radiation tolerance and improved reliability through circuit design.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With a dramatic increase in the number of       complete bacterial genomes in the public and private databases, there exists an      outstanding opportunity for the identification of new antibacterial protein          targets. Interestingly, the accumulation of genomic sequences has been               punctuated by the realization that typically greater than one third of any           genome cannot be annotated for function based on sequence similarity. Several        of these \"unknowns\" have been shown to be genetically validated drug discovery       targets. However, without a defined biochemical activity, unknowns that prove        to be essential for growth and viability are intractable for the purposes of         drug discovery. Biochemical assay of protein function is critical to the             implementation of high-throughput screening to discover lead compounds, to the       determination of a detailed enzyme mechanism, and to the successful                  optimization of those leads to tight-binding inhibitors and ultimately to            efficacious drugs. The proposed research aims to break new ground in the             problem of defining general functional assays, and in understanding the              biochemical activities of proteins of unknown function. The experimental basis       for our proposed methodology involves microcalorimetry and substrate libraries.      In this research proposal, we aim to demonstrate the technology by identifying       substrates for enzymes of unknown function from E. coli, determining the enzyme      mechanisms of these proteins, and designing inhibitors based on the mechanisms.      Establishment of the technology proposed here enables a procedure for the            selection of validated enzyme targets and for the identification of novel            antibacterial drug candidates to combat drug resistant pathogens.                       PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The invention disclosed here provides a method for identifying substrates and inhibitors for new enzyme targets identified through genomic sequencing. As applied to proteins of unknown function from bacterial genomes, the method of substrate profiling allows one to establish assays for anti-bacterial lead compound discovery in the pharmaceutical industry. The annual world wide market for antibiotic compounds is in excess of $23 billion. Single product sales can exceeed $1 billion. The technology described here enables the discovery of novel antibiotics.",

AmberGen has made                 significant progress during Phase I by developing methods for the rapid              isolation, detection and analysis of proteins.  Referred to as Pro-Screen            (protein screening), the technology is based on the use of tRNAs to                  incorporate special markers and linkers into proteins which are expressed in         vitro from a patient's genomic DNA or mRNA. Specific accomplishments include         demonstration of the ability to rapidly detect truncations, point mutations          and functional defects.  During Phase II, AmberGen will shift its focus              towards clinical applications.  Highly sensitive, rapid and non-isotopic             methods will be introduced for detecting chain-truncating mutations based on         fluorescent-PAGE and chemiluminescence. Rapid screening of point mutations           will be facilitated using UV -MALDI mass spectrometry.  A variety of rapid           functional assays of cancer-linked proteins will be developed which are based        on in vitro incorporation of multiple markers. Clinical applications to be           evaluated include the detection of APC mutations in familial adenamatous             polyposis (FAP); the screening of APC and p53 mutations as part of a                 non-invasive diagnostic assay for colorectal cancer and the profiling of p53         mutations in lung and breast solid-tumors.                                           PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  AmberGen will commercialize Pro-Screen technology with specific applications in the area  of pharmaceutical genomics, screening of inherited diseases, early detection of cancers  and profiling of tumors for clinical diagnosis.  An early focus of commercialization will be  the introduction of screening technology to detect APC and p53 mutations as part of a  non-invasive colorectal cancer test as well as BRCA screening.  Subsequently, several  cancer related genes would be screened using AmberGen's Pro-Screen technology.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Applicant's abstract): Proteomic analysis is an important goal for      the post-genomic era. While all genes in the human genome have now been              decoded, the function of most of these genes remains undetermined. A new             approach for proteomic analysis was demonstrated during Phase I based on in          vitro expression and isolation of proteins. Until now, it has not been possible      to rapidly detect and isolate proteins, which are produced in a cell-free            system. AmberGen has solved this problem by developing a set of                      misaminoacylated tRNAs which facilitate the rapid non-isotopic detection,            isolation and N-terminal labeling of nascent proteins. Phase II research will        focus on analyzing libraries of in vitro expressed proteins (LIVE-PRO) derived       from human cDNA, mRNA and plasmid libraries. Test proteins expressed from these      libraries including DHFR, RAS, P53 and C-Jun will be analyzed. Mass                  spectrometry and capillary electrophoresis will be used as methods for rapidly       screening tRNA labeled nascent proteins. Two specific applications of this           approach are the rapid screening of LIVE-PRO to determine post-translational         modifications and interactions with other molecules including DNA, proteases         and potential drug compounds. Market opportunities for LIVE-PRO including sale       of reagents, hardware and licenses to drug companies are estimated to exceed         $100 million/year.

In Phase I we made a significant step towards addressing this      central issue by successfully demonstrating a novel ceramic material with            superior mechanical properties. An enhancement of 50 percent in fracture             toughness, 50 percent in weibull modulus and significant damage resistance over      conventional ceramics was demonstrated. Thus, we have been able to establish         materials which, from a safety and design aspect, will have significantly lower      risk of brittle failure in vivo. Furthermore, we have been able to adpat the         ceramics for articulation with CoCr. From a bio-compatibility aspect, no             adverse effects are expected in-vivo. Early wear performance results of              head/cup components made from these ceramics also clearly show the ultra low         wear characteristics, with wear volumes 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than           present CoCr-PE. In Phase II, we propose to extend these promising results by        optimizing the component design tolerances using a rigorous statistically valid      approach, characterizing the static and fatigue strength of THA implant              components, and performing a comprehensive in-vitro and invivo                       bio-compatibility evaluation. We also propose to extend the wear tests (n=6) to      10 million cycles in a hip simulator to confirm the functionality of the             optimized components. Major orthopedic implant manufacturers have expressed          interest in collaborating on the evaluation and optimization of the novel            ceramic designs.                                                                         PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The combination of safety (mechanical and biological) and function (ultra-low wear) and compatibility with CoCr offers a new bearing materail set that promises to eliminate the central issue plaguing THA - wear debris mediated osteolysis and implant failures. A comprehanesive program to establish the safety and function of the materials will help speed the commercialization of these implants in Phase III.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Phase I proposal develops a novel technology to automate the process of docking the Shuttle to the International Space Station (ISS). This technology is based on the Laser Dynamic Range Imager (LDRI) and a cross-plane point tracking algorithm. The LDRI provides the range measurement from the laser unit to the field of view for far or near inspection distances. The LDRI is a dynamic adaptation of the Scannerless Range Imager (SRI) technology developed for the USAF by DOE/Sandia National Laboratories. The Point Tracking (PT) software package is an improvement of the tracker algorithm initially proposed at Langley Research Center and later developed at Johnson Space Center. The advantage of this technology over the conventional photogrammetric methods resides in the feasibility in obtaining, simultaneously, the 3-D motion of multiple points without the necessity of using multiple cameras. Other advantages of this technology are the improvement in the resolution of the position of a point and the elimination of special illuminating conditions in the scene. This proposal will provide a software package for automated docking. Commercial applications exist in flight vehicle docking, in automated navigation, in flight refueling, precision materials fabrication, collision avoidance and collision analysis.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Phase II project addresses the development of technology that would provide field-based quantitative detection of a wide range of environmental contaminants through the use of molecularly imprinted polymers and fluorescence detection. The proposed method would complement immunological methods of analysis that have been adapted to contaminants such as herbicides and pesticides. The well-documented advantages of these methods, including high sensitivity and selectivity and fairly low cost per analysis, are offset by a number of disadvantages. Antibodies have somewhat limited physical and chemical durability and cannot be used at elevated temperatures, beyond a fairly restricted pH range or in nonaqueous environments. In the Phase I program, American Research Corporation of Virginia developed a compact displacement flow sensor utilizing molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) technology and diode laser-excited near-infrared fluorescence detection. In the Phase II program, work will be performed to optimize and field test the MIP sensor. The innovation of the Phase II program is the development and use of a new generation of biomimetic MIP to provide analyte selectivity and down-stream near-infrared fluorescence as a sensitive means of detection. Phase II also will address the selectivity of the MIP system. The Phase I results have shown that MIP specific for atrazine and 2,4-D can be conveniently prepared and processed. Methods were developed to fabricate rapidly interchangeable cartridges. A low-cost diode-laser based fluorimeter was developed and shown to be capable of extremely low detection limits and very stable operation. Synthetic strategies for preparing fluorophore labeled analyte molecules were developed. The Phase II technical objectives include the preparation of MIP and competition reagents and development of assay methodology optimized for environmental analysis, and fabrication extensive testing of the sensor system.",

Their presence in large numbers can have a detrimental impact on land development and tourism. In addition, these insects are the vector of bluetongue, an arbovirus which is transmitted in cattle and sheep during repeated blood-feeding by biting flies. Our approach is to identify attractants used by Culicoides locate potential vertebrate hosts. In Phase I of this grant, we identified and characterized the carbon dioxide receptor neuron found in sensilla on the maxillary palps of this insect. However, these maxillary palps sensilla were not sensitive to any other chemical tested. Therefore, in Phase II, we will continue these electrophysiological studies on the antenna. We expect to locate neurons sensitive to other chemical attractants. Concurrent with these studies, we propose a series of field test aimed at determining what signals Culicoides use to orient to host. Such studies will lead to the development of an effective trap for Culicoides and should be useful for control of this economically- important pest species.",

Requirements exist for a smaller, less expensive, and more covert SAR system. ZAI/Amelex has introduced a new SAR waveform and systemwhich is very small, light weight, and low power. Recent experiments have demonstrated excellent resolution (~1.0 inch) while simultaneously reducing the energy required for SAR imagery by -30 dB for Low Probability of Intercept (LPI). This SBIR proposalhas two primary Navy goals: 1) Validate the LPI SAR imaging waveform, and 2) Focus the development for transition to P-3 missions in a follow-on program. The Phase II prototype will be designed to demonstrate and validate SAR imagery with an initial designgoal of 2-3 KM. The Phase II effort will then focus on the design of scalable modules for the power supply, power amplifier, and antenna array for an increased range capability of 20+ nm for possible implementation into a P-3C upgrade. A Transition Programwould then take the approach identified as a starting point for final development, test, and evaluation of an extended range version of the LPI SAR, suitable for application to covert P-3 Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missionsrequiring all-weather high resolution.",

Further, the instrument can be moored in position to take timed data, and used in the analysis of sediments in the ocean, bays, harbors (Tengberg, 1995), or planet surfaces. With the concern about Hot Spots, where both copper, tin, lead paints from ships and lead from discarded batteries from lighted buoys is a concern, an instrument such as this could be used to locate contaminated sediments in bays and harbors. A moored electrochemical instrument can also be used to monitor discharge compliance from manufacturing, electrical power plants (for detecting copper or other metal contamination), in monitoring the effluent from hydrothermal vents (Nuzzio, 1988,1999) or used as a lander on a planetary surface.",

The lack of such a method is an impediment to the commercialization of TPV and reflective concentration systems.   This project will use multi-layer substrates to imbed protective diodes underneath the PV cells so that precious module aperture area is not used.  Additionally, PV cell reconfiguration will maximize the potential for dense packing.  Phase I proved the viability of the dense cell packing concept as well as the concept of burying protective diodes into the dense cell array substrate.  Computer analysis identified three potential substrate candidates.  Phase II will take these three candidates to the prototype level.  Performance, manufacturability, reliability, and cost analysis will be performed, and a successful substrate configuration will be chosen.  All production processes, tooling, and equipment will be developed and implemented.                Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The overall performance of TPV and reflective solar concentrator PV systems are highly dependent on the efficient utilization of the area being illuminated  the PV cell array.  A cell array configuration for these applications that is optimized for performance and reliability, and that is combined with the technical advances in TPV emitter designs and recent reflective concentrator developments, should result in a cost-effective, efficient renewable energy source and the emergence of a vital new US industry",

Amphipols represent a unique way of      solubilizing integral membrane proteins. Amphipols wrap themselves around the        hydrophobic transmembrane domains of membrane proteins so that the hydrophobic       side chains of the polymer stabilize the hydrophobic surface of the protein,         while the polar side chains of the polymer confer aqueous solubility to the          protein-amphipol complex                                                                                                                                                  In Phase I a new and simpler route to the only existing family of amphipols was      developed and an entirely new and potentially useful family of amphipols was         discovered. In Phase II we plan to synthesize and characterize a number of           variations of this family (called PMALT). These new molecules will be evaluated      in the laboratory of Dr. Charles R. Sanders for their ability to solublize,          stabilize, and maintain the functionality of membrane proteins. The study will       provide the basis for future unique applications of amphipols in structural          biology biochemistries, biomedicine, and biotechnology.                              PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The possibility of using the materials proposed here to study membrane protein  structure in solution via NMR is especially appearing.  Amphipols may also provide  the basis for new approaches in drug delivery, biosensors, and other biomedical/  technological applications.  Presently, there is no commercial source for amphipol-  class polymers.  Anatrace has a history of timely introduction of new, useful  detergent and other biochemicals to the international technical community.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Manned exploration beyond Mars requires very high specific energy. The only potential solution under discussion is fusion propulsion. However, fusion has been ten years away for forty years. We have an available solution that combines new technology with an old concept  Project Orion. The proposed MagOrion Propulsion System combines a magnetic sail (MagSail) with conventional small yield (0.5 to 1.0 kiloton) shaped nuclear fission devices. At detonation, roughly eighty percent of the yield appears as a highly-ionized plasma, and when detonated two kilometers behind a robust MagSail, approximately half of this plasma can be stopped and turned into thrust. A MagOrion can provide a system acceleration of one or more gravities with effective specific impulses ranging from 15,000 to 45,000 seconds. Dana Andrews and Robert Zubrin published a paper in 1997 that described the operating principles of the MagOrion. We have taken that concept through conceptual design to identify the major operational features and risks. During Phase I of the SBIR, we will quantify the system risks and establish either solutions or areas for risk mitigating demonstrations. The risks are considerable, but the potential payoff is staggering. Our proposed MagOrion will enable affordable exploration of the solar system.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         As the current trends in transistor miniaturization are continued down to the molecular level ( in a dimension of tens of nanometers or less),  the electronic properties of solids and solid-solid interfaces are inherently different on the nanometer level.It is becoming clear that continued increases in circuit density will require fairly dramatic changes in the way transistors are designed and operated.  The concept of single electron transistor has the potential to revolutionize this field.  This programseeks to build on the success of Phase I to develop nanoelectronic devices with an innovation that focuses on highly monodispersed MINIM (metal-insulator-nanocluster-insulator-metal arrays for single electron transistors.  During Phase I, AMSENTechnologies demonstrated the concept that an innovative template-synthesized MINIM arrays could be potentially used as single electron transistors.  During Phase II of this program, AMSEN will build on Phase I success, optimize, build prototyped and fieldtest the technology in partnership with DOD and do the ground work for commercialization.  Phase II will commercialize the technology and anticipated spin-off  The potential for commercialization of single electron devices with good performance andmanufacturability is extremely high.  Applications for single electron transistors include ultra-high density information storage, supersensitive electrometry, near-infrared radiation receivers and DC current standard.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is to develop a method to         prolong the shelf-life and increase the safety of human platelets with a unique      method of sterilization. The method delivers an agent known to kill a range of       microbial pathogens in vitro including many bacterial species known to               contaminate platelet concentrates, fungi, parasites, and viruses. The lethal         agent can be released from an insoluble polymer that can be incorporated into        the plastic that comprises the collection bag. The microbicide breaks down           rapidly to normal physiological by-products, presenting little danger to the         patient. Successful development of this method will increase the safety of the       platelet and plasma supply, and, by inhibiting microbial growth, increase the        shelf-life of platelets.                                                                                                                                                  The focus of the effort will be to develop a storage container made from             polymers that release sufficient quantities of the lethal agent. Alternative         strategies include increasing the polymer surface area, via alterations in the       storage container, that will allow release of sufficient lethal agent for            efficacy. Antimicrobial spectra of the lethal agent will continue to be              assessed before and during prototype stages. Physiological assessments of the        effects of the lethal agent on platelets will be performed. Prototype                containers will be tested under blood bank conditions.

The need for such training was confirmed by the results of Phase I where it was shown that (1) critical thinking (CT) skills are important toBattle Command success, (2) poor CT performance creates serious problems for Command/Control, and (3) military curriculum does not train CT skills effectively.  This research and development project provides a unique opportunity to combine tacticalexpertise with leading edge developments in psychological theory. Phase II will focus on development of high-quality information content to support training of critical thinking skills.  An integrated network of military officers, training developers,computer scientists, and end users will form an advisory panel whose task it will be to guide development of the content and form of the proposed training. Phase II subsumes four tasks designed to (1) validate the theory of critical thinking developed inPhase I by conducting innovative experimental studies of CT, (2) shepherd results of the experimental studies into content for developing CT training modules, (3) implement training modules on the worldwide-web, and (4) evaluate effectiveness of theweb-based training using students drawn from the schoolhouse and tactical field units.",

HCV is the most prevalent             chronic bloodborne infection in the U.S. Although the number of new infections       has declined substantially, there are still an estimated 36,000 new infections       each year and approximately 1.8 percent of the U.S. population (3.9 million) is      chronically infected. As much as 40 percent of chronic liver disease is HCV          related and this results in up to 10,000 deaths each year. The presence of           anti-HCV antibody does not distinguish between acute, chronic, or resolved           infection nor can anti-HCV antibody levels be used to monitor disease                progression or therapeutic efficacy. Quantitative measurement of HCV RNA levels      in serum has been successfully used to predict response to therapy. Several          qualitative and quantitative HCV RNA assays have been developed, but none is         without technical problems and none has yet received FDA approval. Optimal           management of HCV infections and further progress toward understanding HCV           pathogenesis will depend on ongoing efforts to maximize the performance of HCV       RNA load assays. This proposal targets a unique region of the genome which may       be critical to achieving this goal.                                                 PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Measurement of the level of HCV RNA in serum is becoming an increasingly important component of the management of patients who are chronically infected with HCV. Optimal management of HCV infections will depend on continued efforts to maximize the performance of HCV RNA load assays. If the 3'NTR proves to be the optimal genomic target for measuring HCV RNA, the work proposed here will be directly applied to a commercially and clinically valuable HCV viral load test.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Mercury from combustion sources is a major concern to the nation's air quality. In December 2000, EPA announced that it would regulate mercury emissions from coal-fired boilers under Title III of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. EPA plans to issue final regulations by December 2004, and is expected to require compliance by December 2007. The Department of Energy estimates that control of mercury emissions from coal-fired utility boilers will cost billions of dollars annually. Prior to installing a mercury control system, improved measurements of mercury emissions would allow EPA and the utility to make better decisions concerning control options. Real-time continuous monitoring of mercury would provide options for advanced process control feedback and for monitoring the performance of the control system, thus lowering the cost of mercury controls. Although a few mercury analyzers show promise for measuring elemental mercury, a reliable sampling system that allows these analyzers to measure total (particulate, vapor-phase) and speciated mercury continuously and in real time in the flue gas of coal-fired boilers is needed. Apogee is defining a new state-of-the-art in mercury measurement by developing a novel sample conditioning system (SCS) for the continuous real-time monitoring of mercury in flue gas from coal-fired boilers.",

An innovative, miniature broadband conformal aperture is proposed as the array element to minimizereal estate and increase the frequency coverage of the array. The antenna element has a possible bandwidth of greater than 100:1 and its operation has already been demonstrated.  The proposed Phase II work plan focuses on the development of directionfinding arrays with particular emphasis on their design and operation down to 20MHz. Unique software toolsets will be employed for complete design and evaluation of the antenna array directly on the UAV installation. These simulations will be validatedwith measured data at higher frequencies to establish a baseline for the proposed design tools that incorporate element to element coupling as well as substructure coupling. At the lower HF/VHF frequencies, these simulations will be used to design thearray and establish reference AoA vs Phase curves that account for platform interactions and possible non-planar installations of the array. Designs that cover the entire band of interest are proposed accounting for the necessity of using multiple arrayconfigurations over the different bands.",

In Phase I, this new approach \"Smart Key Technology (TM)\" (SKT) was          investigated, further developed, and tested. Using \"letter prediction, SKT           searches currently loaded dictionaries (files containing word, sentence, and         abbreviation lists ordinarily used with word prediction) and identifies all          letters that follow the currently typed character string. Depending on the           option selected, SKT \"identifies\" the most likely next letter(s) by removing,        graying out, or changing the color of unlikely letters presented on the              on-screen keyboard. In the experiment conducted, subjects typed significantly        more letters during a set time period when using SKT with an on-screen keyboard      under both point-and-click (when the keyboard was unfamiliar) and scanning           conditions. Most notable was the dramatic improvement under scanning                 conditions. Hypothesized sources of performance enhancement are 1) reduced           visual scanning time, 2) simpler displays, 3) reduced probability of selecting       an incorrect key, and 4) decreased key selection time (for scanning keyboards).      In the proposed Phase II work, further enhancements of SKT will be made and two      important variations of SKT will be developed and tested.       PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Not available",

Hall and ion thrusters are two types of electric propulsion systems that are commonly used on earth-orbiting spacecraft and very recently on interplanetary probes. These propulsion systems use hollow cathodes to thermionically emit electrons that are used for propellant ionization and ion beam neutralization. These cathodes require propellants and heaters that place lower limits on their size and power scalability and efficiency. Field emission cathodes compatible with electric propulsion systems will fill voids in electric propulsion technology that are needed for deep-space microspacecraft applications. Other field emission electron sources such as metal microtip cathodes are unstable and strongly susceptible to damage in the thruster ion environment. Preliminary tests on carbon film cathodes show them to be much more robust. We propose to demonstrate the feasibility of using carbon cathodes in electric propulsion systems for microspacecraft applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         61042        Thyratrons, ignitrons, and spark gaps are used to switch tens of kilovolts at high current and at high rate of current risetime in high power modulators for high energy particle accelerators and other applications.  These devices have one or more disadvantages, including high cost, limited lifetime, large expense for maintenance and/or replacement, and complexity of mounting, cooling and triggering.  This project will develop a modular switch design that uses thyristors capable of high di/dt without saturable inductors; uses a portion of the energy that is being switched to drive the gates, simplifying isolation and triggering; is easy to mount and cool; and will result in an economical switch.  In Phase I, an experimental switch module was developed and tested.  It was  shown that a 10 kV module can operate reliably at >8kA, at di/dts >30 kA/s, for a 3 s pulse.  Operation of 3 modules in series at 30 kV with similar current pulses showing simultaneous turn-on and good voltage sharing between modules was demonstrated.   In Phase II, a prototype 10 kV module will be developed and tested at high power with emphasis on thermal design and packaging to maximize its power handling capability while minimizing thermal fatigue.  This module will be used as the basis of a compact 50kV prototype switch that will be developed, tested and delivered to the Department of Energy.  This switch can be used to replace thyratrons in existing systems.                    Commercial Applications And Other Benefits as described by the awardee: Systems that should benefit from these switches include pulse modulators for high power RF and microwave amplifiers used in particle accelerators, radar, and defense applications; industrial medium and high power pulsed lasers; kicker magnet drives; compact medical and industrial x-ray sources; pulsed electron, ion, or radiation sources for material processing, and food and water purification",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Next generation design software will support fully associative geometric and physics-based analysis models throughout the entire product life-cycle. Most current CAD systems directly support finite element systems, but use proprietary database formats that do not promote diverse tool use and may not exist throughout the entire product life-cycle. Model sharing in common practice has been limited to exchanging model instances (without parametric information) via data interchange files (e.g., STEP) or data translation software interfaces (e.g., Parametric Technology's Associative Topology Bus). This approach makes parallel, multi-corporation design inefficient. Additionally, although CAD systems support finite element analysis, this capability usually does not support coupled multidisciplinary, multiple level-of-fidelity analysis models, and so significant effort is expended preparing models for analysis. Software integration packages such as Engineous' iSIGHT and Phoenix Integration's Model Center provide intuitive tools for automating analysis by linking legacy codes together, but do not simplify the development of the analysis model itself. Alternative solutions such as TechnoSoft's AML are more flexible, but require an object-oriented software developer to generate source code for each model. This research will develop a lightweight, platform-neutral analysis model bus (AMB) that exploits Internet data modeling and collaboration technologies to make possible the widespread, distributed storage of and collaborative access to diverse analysis models.",

The robotic therapy device proposed here, called ARCHIME for         the purposes of this proposal, has the potential to improve rehabilitation           outcomes significantly for individuals who have upper limb impairments due to        stroke.                                                                                                                                                                   Demographic trends indicate a significant increase in the already large              population of individuals who have experienced a stroke. The resulting loss of       upper limb motor function is often resistant to therapeutic efforts. With the        dramatic reduction of inpatient rehabilitation length of stay following.             stroke, it is now critical to develop efficient, scientifically-validated            interventions. The combination of demographic trends and healthcare cost             containment pressures, and limitations in current clinical practice provide          convincing evidence to support the potential for ARCMIME to become a                 commercially successful product.                                                     PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The commercial applications of this project are the manufacture and distribution of a  robotic therapy machine providing clinical rehabilitation of a stroke impairment, which  is enchanced by computerized assessment and automated routines for remote or  networked therapy.  This methodology would lead to a more cost effective therapy  that could be developed for other forms of rehabilitation therapy.",

Several recent hyperspectral collection campaigns conducted by the ArmyNight Vision Laboratory and the Central MASINT Organization have demonstrated the ability to rapidly and automatically detect, discriminate and identify materials based on spectral signature information in various levels of natural and man-madeconcealment.Given the capabilities of current and near-term hyperspectral systems, a software tool that allows users to simultaneously exploit hyperspectral data and evaluate the detectability of high priority signature managed materials in realistic backgrounds is anecessity.  Under this Phase II research program ASIT will develop a system that combines a capability for target detection, discrimination, and identification with an ability to provide performance assessment for hyperspectral data with wavelengthcoverage in the .4 - 14 micron range.  The program will result in two products: 1) Hyperspectral Detectability Assessment Software Tool and 2) Portable Spectral Detection and Analysis System which will be connected directly to a VIS/NIR hand-heldspectrometer.  The Phase II program will conclude with a field demonstration and delivery of the portable detection analysis system.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         60633      Fuel cells are widely viewed as the most desirable future power generation method, because of their unique combination of high efficiency, low emissions, size flexibility, and quiet operation.  Despite these unique features, the high cost of fuel cells compared with competing technologies has prevented commercial introduction.  One of the key factors that increases fuel cell power plant cost and complexity is the typically poor fuel flexibility, i.e. fuel cells generally operate only on hydrogen.   This project will demonstrate technology to allow low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) to operate directly and efficiently on hydrocarbon fuels including natural gas, propane, and gasoline.  Phase I developed new anode materials that effectively oxidize hydrocarbons at fuel cell operating temperatures ranging from 500-800C.   Specifically, different anodes were found to be most suitable for use with the different fuels studied; i.e., methane and propane.  The new anodes were successfully demonstrated in single fuel cells.   Phase II will demonstrate a simple SOFC stack that directly utilizes a range of hydrocarbon fuels.  The low-cost fabrication methods developed in Phase I will be scaled up to make large-area, thin-electrolyte SOFCs, and a novel stack design will be implemented.   Long term cell stability and susceptibility to sulfur contamination will be addressed, and anode compositions will be refined to optimize performance.                   Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The technology should impact the commercialization of fuel cells, currently being developed for medium-scale generation applications, by simplifying the system and reducing costs.  Additional commercial markets include home generators (natural gas), remote generation and portable electronics power supplies (propane), and auxiliary power units for transportation (gasoline)",

To accomplish this goal, new generation thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) with superiorreliability and durability will be needed.  The currently-used zirconia-based TBCs do not adequately meet thermal conductivity requirements and they suffer from thermomechanical degradation during exposure at elevated temperatures. In this effort, a novelcrystal chemistry approach is being explored to examine a new family of layered perovskites as TBC materials.   Key properties of these highly anisotropic materials include low thermal conductivity (0.7 W/m-K @ 13000C), tailorable CTE to potentially matchsubstrate for minimizing residual stress, and inherent strain tolerance to potentially accommodate stresses induced during thermal exposure and cycling.  During Phase II, coatings of proposed material will be produced by plasma spray technology.  The focuswill be to optimize coatings for obtaining thermally stable and desired microstructure, crystallographic texture, and thickness to yield durable and reliable TBCs that also meet Army's targeted requirements for low thermal conductivity.  Thermal cyclingtests will be conducted on coated superalloy coupons to determine coating performance and durability.  The work will be conducted in collaboration with a turbine engine manufacturer.",

Tools that truly support EBO must be based on a detailed understanding of the organizational structure and processes for informationgathering, information fusion, COA development, and command decision making that allow EBO to occur.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Commercial microalgal production still relies heavily on batch culture methods. Recent investigations have been successful in the development of enclosed photobioreactors, though mostly still at the research level. Due to several factors, production costs of continuous culture methods remain high and thwart the adoption within the commercial aquaculture sector. This project will investigate the use of greenhouses and control algorithms to enhance production and reduce energy input in a Hydraulically Integrated Serial Turbidostat Algal Reactor (HISTAR). Phase I results indicate that HISTAR is capable of sustained production and contaminant mitigation under varying temperature and irradiance regimes seen in greenhouses. The objective of this Phase II project is to refine the HISTAR technology at AST, develop design production and operational criteria, determine nutritional consistency, determine profitability and execute beta II testing at three commercial sites. A suite of 15-month studies will be performed over the two-year project period to collect the productivity data required for modeling and economic analysis efforts. The data will also be compared to performance data collected historically on HISTAR operated under artificially illuminated conditions. Systems will be installed at three commercial sites in the second year and evaluated using the same protocols developed for the AST system. Successful results will position the HISTAR technology for commercial adoption within one year following the end of this product.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The Army has identified the need for open standards based multimedia terminals that integrate voice, video and data to implement multimedia applications for battlefield environments. H.323 is expected to be one of the predominant terminal standards forimplementing such applications over the Army's integrated services networks of the future. The major technical challenges that must be addressed to enable the deployment of battlefield multimedia applications over such networks are: 1) ability toefficiently integrate with existing multimedia terminals on circuit switched networks 2) development of end-to-end security mechanisms for multimedia streams, (from SBU through Top Secret levels) over integrated networks and 3) the development ofmechanisms for bandwidth-efficient transport of real-time multimedia (video, audio, data) streams with predefined QoS requirements over bandwidth-constrained IP backbone network. The Phase I SBIR effort successfully designed and established the feasibilityof building programmable distributed gateway architecture, called SAINCaP (Secure Architecture for Integrated Circuit and Packet Switching Applications), to address these requirements. SAINCaP is a highly adaptable architecture that is designed toaccommodate technology evolution. The Phase II effort will build a functioning prototype of SAINCaP. This prototype implementation of SAINCaP will then be transitioned into a commercial product during Phase III.",

Weemploy a sensor technology that, by design, can be mass-producedat low cost, yet achieves performance that is the same orsuperior to that currently available . The same basic sensordesign will be capable of supporting a variety of deploymentstrategies, from numerous platforms, with the initial emphasisbeing on expendable devices. In Phase I,  Aret developed aprototype oceanographic conductivity and temperature sensorsystem, a breadboard circuit, a brass-board, circuit, and aprototype power circuit. The design was accomplished with low-cost, simplicity, and high-performance as the main drivers. Themulti-layer ceramic circuit card, which is the platform for bothsensors and electronics, was prototyped. For Phase II, Aret willconcentrate on the development of a multi-chip-module (MCM) andintegrate a MEMS-technology pressure transducer on the sensorsubstrate. We will manufacture a small number of prototypesensors and test them at sea. Options are included to broaden themeasurement capability beyond the expendable device.",

However, problems in TPV cell characterization, needed for manufacturing process control have an adverse impact on efficient cell manufacturing and yields.  This project will develop an `On Chip smart sensor array to characterize TPV cell parameters such as temperature gradients, poly metal sheet resistively, and thin film substrate thickness.   Using a custom smart sensor array and an application specific Device Characterization Platform, accurate `On Cell measurements and control via wireless tele-platform feedback system will be engineered.  In Phase I, the `On Chip sensor array concept was verified through virtual software system analysis.   An application-specific Device Characterization Platform was built and its rudimentary interface circuits were tested for integrity, functionality, and performance.   In Phase II, the actual TPV cell with `On Chip embedded smart sensor array will be fabricated.  Prototype TPV cell units will be used on the TPV Device Characterization Platform to collect temperature gradient data.                   Commercial Applications And Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The technology should result in reduced TPV cell costs and improved energy conversion. Applications that have waste heat and require noiseless and emission free compact electrical generators should be candidate markets for this TPV technology.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant): The aim of this project is to develop a         portable, low cost, fast and easy-to-use device for the quantitative assessment      of bone quality that is suitable for mass screening and early identification of      those at risk for osteoporosis. The device will detect changes in the                composition and micro-architectural properties of bone by measuring the              ultrasound velocity, attenuation, spectral, and non-linear acoustic (NLA)            parameters of bone at multiple sites along the skeleton with varied proportion       of spongy and compact bone components. The manual scanning probe operating in        surface pulse transmission mode will be used to obtain ultrasonic profiles in        tested skeletal area. The diagnostic potential of NLA spectroscopy as a novel        method for detecting the accumulation of microdamage in living bone will be          evaluated. The feasibility of the proposed methods and devices has been proven       in laboratory model studies and in pilot clinical trials. In Phase II of the         project designed during Phase I will be developed into a fully functional and        compact bone ultrasonometer with the manual scanning and NLA modes of                operation, and clinically tested. Indexes of bone quality composed of several        ultrasonic parameters will be developed for differential diagnostics of              osteoporosis and mixed osteopenia.                                                   PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS:  Early evaluation and monitoring of osteoporosis is imperative for timely and effective  treatment of the disease. According to the National Osteoporosis Foundation [1998 Report]  the current economic burden associated with osteoporosis-related fractures is estimated  at about $13.8 billion annually.  There is an urgent need for advancement of the existing  diagnostic techniques.  The Proposed multi-site ultrasonometer offers higher diagnostic  efficacy and specificity, lower cost, portability, and ease of operation.  Developed device is  ideally suited for the mass screening of osteoporosis and primary monitoring of population  with high fracture risk.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Non-healing bone fractures and periodontal bone loss constitute significant clinical problems with few approved medical options. Bone repair is enhanced by the presence of osteoblasts or osteoblastic precursor cells. Subcutaneous adipose tissue is a plentiful, accessible, and replenishable source of human stromal cells for transplantation. In Phase I of this SBIR, we tested the hypothesis that human adipose tissue-derived stromal cells are capable of osteoblast function. Substantial in vitro data indicates that these stromal cells differentiate into cells biochemically and morphologically similar to osteoblasts. The ability of these cells to form bone in vivo was examined as well. Phase II of this SBIR will extend these in vivo experiments. Specific Aim 1 examines the ability of human adipose tissue-derived stromal cells to form ectopic bone in hydroxyapatite ceramic cubes implanted subcutaneously in immunodeficient mice. Specific Aim 2 explores whether the introduction of a modified bone morphogenetic protein receptor will enhance mineralization by these cells in vitro. Specific Aim 3 will determine if these modified bone morphogenetic protein receptor expressing stromal cells form bone more rapidly and efficiently than control cells using the in vivo murine model described in Aim 1. Together, these studies will provide a strong foundation for pre-clinical experiments in a large animal (canine) fracture repair model. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: This technology will provide a cost-effective alternative source of stromal cells capable of osteoblast differentiation for autologous and allogeneic transplantation into sites of bone defects and fractures. This has commercial application to orthopedic and periodontal surgical treatments of joint replacement, fracture repair, and bone resorption secondary to tooth decay.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         60410      In order to use conventional fuels in fuel cells, the fuel must be converted to a hydrogen-rich reformate.  High levels of carbon monoxide in the reformate poison the fuel cell anode catalyst and degrade fuel cell performance.  A method is sought by which to reduce the carbon monoxide concentration to less than ten parts per million, while not decreasing the hydrogen content of the  reformate.  This project will develop a novel absorption and shift reactor that will react CO with H2O to produce CO2 and H2 while absorbing one of the components in a sorbent material.  The resultant device will be regenerable, compact, requires little control and raises the hydrogen content of the reformate.   High capacity regenerable sorbents were developed in Phase I and integrated with catalytic materials in a small-scale reactor.  Continuous CO removal to less than 10 ppm was demonstrated.  A 1 kWe system was designed and system specifications and costs were estimated.  In Phase II, further development of the advanced materials will be pursued in order to reduce system size and cost.  A 1 kWe standalone prototype will be constructed and tested to determine its efficiency and robustness.  Long-term operation of a 1 kWe PEM fuel cell operating on the effluent from this prototype will be demonstrated.                        Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: A reformate purification device with the above characteristics would have wide-ranging applicability to hydrogen fuel processors for stationary and mobile fuel cells.  This low-cost device offers the potential for improved fuel cell efficiencies compared to conventional carbon monoxide removal processes",

Recent preliminary tests at Aspen demonstrated that a halocarbon compound used as a doping ingredient during the silica aerogel preparation has great potential for satisfying both requirements. Detailed material characterization and performance evaluation in terms of hydrophobic property, non-flammability and thermal insulation will be conducted. In Phase II, this and other means of achieving the dual objectives will be further explored. Flight qualification testing and production scaleup (utilizing Aspen's 1000 liter pilot plant to be installed by September 2000 under a separate project) will also be accomplished in Phase II. This product, if successfully developed, will be an excellent substitute for the expensive and cumbersome vacuum-jacketed Multi Layer Insualtion (MLI) for cryogenic insulation as well as other applications.",

The fiber-optic sensor approach will provide an innovative way to measure the forces involved with dexterous grasps and power during extra-vehicular activity (EVA) on-board the International Space Station (ISS). The fiber-optic sensors are immune to electromagnetic interference (EMI) and they are extremely small, light weight and easy to install. They can be multiplexed so that at least twelve sensors can be used along a single fiber-optic cable. This will provide a significant reduction in cabling size and weight over conventional strain gauge systems. A miniaturized data acquisition system can be utilized to provide further weight reduction and robustoness when used in the extreme environment of space. This innovation is relevant and important to meeting the technology need of NASA by providing a light weight and technologically improved method to measure force feedback that will provide operator awareness of gripping forces and force moments due to contact with external objects.",

This Phase II effort will develop and implement an alternative technique, Efficient Code Certification (ECC), that can establish the trustworthiness of code regardless of its origin.  Our BootSafeverifier, based on ECC, will   verify the safety of all boot firmware (before it is run) every time a system is booted.  This verification relies on a certifying compiler that produces particularly well-structured code, so that a verifier can analyze itstatically.  The user need only trust the verifier, a  program that can be persuasively validated by inspection.  By applying ECC to boot firmware based on the widely used Open Firmware standard (IEEE-1275) we can provide an effective countermeasure topotentially devastating attacks.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Various planned NASA missions depend on the availability of reliable and efficient coolers that achieve temperatures below 6K. These coolers are needed as the upper stage for lower temperature coolers such as dilution refrigerators or adiabatic demagnetization refrigerators. Astronomical missions utilize such low temperatures to enhance infrared detector sensitivity and to cool optics. Low temperature cryocoolers form an indispensable part of astronomical missions which require long-term cooling of detectors (e.g. bolometers). Without active coolers the duration of cryogenic missions is limited by the size of the cryogen that can be incorporated in the respective space missions.A pulse tube cooler (PTC) driven by a long-life linear compressor embodies the high reliability and low vibration required in space missions. The absence of cold moving parts reduces wear and vibration and increases reliability which makes PTCs ultimately suited for space. Single-stage PTCs, driven by linear compressors and with a porous, stainless steel regenerator matrix, have achieved no-load temperatures below 50K. To provide cooling at lower temperatures the PTC requires additional stages with regenerators made from high heat capacity materials. The innovation we propose involves development of a multistage PTC driven by a linear compressor that achieves temperatures below 6K.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Superconducting generators and RF magnets will be the leading technologies for high electrical power systems on aircraft, spacecraft and ground based systems in future DoD applications.  These systems employ High Temperature Superconducting (HTS) materialsoperating at cryogenic temperatures.  Future HTS systems will employ Yttrium Barium Copper Oxide (YBCO) which requires cooling near 65K.  At present, the more mature HTS conductor Bismuth Strontium Calcium Copper Oxide (BSCCO) requires cooling down to 30K.Two cooling requirements have been set forth.  The HTS rotor coils and RF magnets will need 30W of cooling at 65K, while the HTS armature windings will require an order of magnitude higher cooling power at the same operating temperature.  We propose todevelop cryocoolers that will meet both these requirements.  A single-stage pulse tube cooler (PTC) will be developed to provide 300W at 65K, which may be used in cooling armature windings.  The lower temperature requirement (30K) will be met by developinga two-stage PTC.  In order to achieve high efficiency and reliability, and to reduce mass, both cryocoolers will employ a linear compressor.  Inertance tubes will be used for optimum phase shift between pressure and mass flow.  The pulse tube will betapered to minimize streaming losses.A study will be conducted to identify methods by which the weight and size of the  cryocooler can be minimized.  We anticipate that it will be possible to define a design that is more than 75% lighter overall (less than 130 lbs. total) than the Phase IIprototype unit (~505 lbs.) without compromising any of the performance, life and reliability requirements.We have developed strategic alliances with worldwide leaders of three different cryogenic markets.  The strategic alliances involve direct partner participation in the Phase II program and include planning to transition to rate production during Phase III.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION: The efficacy and safety of photodynamic therapy (PDT) depends on        an understanding of photosensitizer and light biology and dosimetry. Therefore,      the ability to accurately determine photosensitizer levels in tumors and             at-risk normal tissues is of utmost importance. The goal of this work is to          develop and test a prototype system for fluorescence based measurement of            photosensitizer uptake in tissue, to improve photodynamic therapy (PDT)              dosimetry. The fiber optic system is designed to quantify photosensitizer            concentration by detecting a fluorescence intensity signal which minimizes the       impact of the tissue optical properties. The bundle is also designed to              maximize the signal intensity, allowing quantitation of low concentrations of        photosensitizers. Specialized designs have been developed for tissue surface         measurement, interstitial measurement and sampling of drawn blood samples. The       system is flexible enough to measure either porphyrin-based or                       phthalocyanine-based photosensitizers, and will specifically be tested in            aminolevulinic acid-induced protoporphyrin IX (ALA - PpIX), Photofrin and            aluminum disuiphonated phthalocynanine. The system design will be tested in          three specific applications where PDT can be successfully commercialized,            including (i) veterinary animal tumor therapy, (ii) research in experimental         animal tumors, and (iii) adjuvant therapy for human brain tumors after               resection. In order to successfully evaluate the system in these different PDT       markets, prototype systems will be developed and tested in academic research         labs at Dartmouth Medical School and the University of Toronto. The tests will       (i) determine how robust the design is, (ii) determine if this dosimetry method      improves PDT treatment outcome and (iii) demonstrate safety in human use, prior      to commercial development.

        "abstract": "Abstract         60104       Asbestos abatement costs, associated with the DOEs national weapons complex clean-up efforts, may amount to $300-500 million, while nationally, asbestos abatement may cost more than $100 billion over the next 25 years.  Abatement methods have changed little in the past 20 years, and there is a need for a cheaper, faster, and safer abatement method.    This project will design, build, test, and commercialize an in-situ asbestos abatement system, called PipeTaz,  designed to: (1) reduce the personnel required to abate asbestos, (2) increase the speed at which asbestos insulation can be removed, (3) allow the cleaned pipe to be recycled, and (4) reduce the volume and weight of asbestos.   In Phase I, laboratory tests of various concepts for PipeTaz were conducted, design specifications for the system were developed, the functionality of a pre-prototype cutting system was tested, and a hand-held asbestos removal tool was modified.  The Phase I effort showed that the conceived PipeTaz abatement approach is feasible and demonstrated optimal cutting and pipe transport technologies.   Phase II will: (1) develop a complete and detailed system design; (2) fabricate, assemble, and test the prototype system using simulant-material; (3) develop a Technology Safety Data Sheet, Human Factors Assessment Document, and a regulatory and operational review; and (4) perform pilot-trials with asbestos-containing materials under realistic field conditions.                        Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: PipeTaz should be useful for any pipe-asbestos demolition job, and the system could be used by most companies.  PipeTaz will (1) reduce pipe-asbestos removal costs, (2) increase abatement productivity, (3) increase abatement safety, (4) reduce waste packaging in handling costs, (5) allow for waste stream separation, (6) allow for waste volume reduction, (7) result in reduced disposal costs, (8) enable the recycling of steel pipe waste, (9) reduce the volume of asbestos waste, and (10) reduce environmental costs/burdens.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The overall project objective is to develop a commercial software product to improve the resolution and allow for quantitative analysis of specimens imaged using differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy, by reconstructing a map of the optical path length distribution. This will essentially enable a DIC microscope to operate as a \"virtual\" transmitted light interference microscope. Phase 1 has shown the feasibility of reconstructing both 2D and 3D biological specimens. This resolution improvement will allow sub-cellular components of sizes that are near, or just below, the microscope diffraction limit to be resolved. Among other advantages, the optical path length information will enable the dry mass of a cell to be quantified, and for the reconstructed data to be used with standard 3D visualization methods or for automated cell analysis. The Phase 2 objectives are to refine the algorithm development to a commercial level, including; integration of the reconstruction and deconvolution algorithms, and improvements in robustness and speed. The accuracy of the optical path length information will be verified using test targets and biological specimens with known characteristics. Additional 2D and 3D biological specimens will be captured and processed to analyze performance and establish the required imaging protocol. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: DIC microscopy is a widely used modality for observing live specimens, and the instrument will be enhanced by the quantitative results produced by the reconstruction software. DIC could now be quantitatively used when photo-toxic epi-fluorescence is undesirable. 3D specimens can now be captured in DIC and volume rendered. Changes in cell growth can be tracked, which will benefit genetic engineering. Increases in resolution will enable analysis of structures beyond the optical diffraction limit.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract) Genital herpes is a major           health problem in the U.S. The prevalence of these infections is dramatically        increasing despite effective antiviral drugs. This increase puts young adults        and infants at risk of genital and neonatal herpes, respectively. Neonatal           herpes infections are associated with neurologic impairment and high mortality.      In addition, active genital herpes lesions facilitate the transmission of HIV.       Much of the transmission is due to asymptomatic shedding which highlights the        need for an efficacious prophylactic vaccine to reduce the spread of genital         herpes and thereby reduce the incidence of neonatal herpes. A recent Institute       of Medicine report on vaccine priorities for 21st century highlights the need        for a safe and effective vaccine for genital herpes. Aviron proposes to develop      a live attenuated vaccine to prevent HSV-2 disease. A live, attenuated,              recombinant HSV-2 virus lacking both copies of gamma1 34.5 gene in addition to       UL55, UL56, and US10-US12 was constructed. This recombinant was highly               neuroattenuated and genetically stable. During this proposal this virus will be      evaluated in the guinea pig model of genital herpes for safety and efficacy. In      addition further in vitro characterization will enable high quality clinical         trial material to be produced for IND enabling primate studies and early Phase       I human trials.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The vision for routine space access and rapid turn around rates requires space vehicles to be more aircraft-like in their reliability. To achieve this reliability requires robust, high temperature material systems. Systems under consideration includeceramic or carbon matrix reinforced composite structures. The history of these structures however, suggests their brittle nature and limited design options provides a barrier to their reliable availability to the Military Space Plane. Aztex has recognizedthis limitation and has developed technologies for through-thickness reinforcement, thermal tailoring, and high temperature cures. The proposed Phase II program targets the development of robust durable multi-functional structure and thermal protectionsystems for SOV. Together with our team partner, Boeing Space Systems, we will demonstrate a reinforced high temperature core system, which will serve both as the TPS and the primary load carrying structure. This system will be a major improvement over theredundant TPS and airframe structure considered baseline today. The Aztex/Boeing team understands however, that it is not just one effective structure that makes reliable space flight feasible but robust, design flexible material systems. Thus a keyactivity will be to demonstrate basic materials improvements in interlaminar properties, thermal capability and stiffener attachment.",

In Phase I, the feasibility of a novel SiC source synthesis method and its applicability for the growth of high resistivity SiC (background doping concentration of <10^4 per cc) boules was demonstrated.  In Phase II, thesource material synthesis process will be optimized for cost effectiveness, yield, and purity - especially a reduction in metallic impurities.  In Phase II, the synthesized high purity source material will be used to demonstrate the growth of SI SiCboules, 50mm in diameter.  With the proposed approach, three specific advantages are anticipated: (a) the high yield of the synthesis process is expected to result in low cost of the pure source material, (b) the high purity source material will produceboules whose characteristics are more uniform over their volume, (c) higher wafer yield and reduced cost of SI SiC wafers, which stimulates the widespread commercialization of the material for microwave and RF system applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Interest in increased flight safety, aircraft survivability, and performance improvements has led to significant advances in the design of adaptive fault tolerant (reconfigurable) control systems.  However, there is a substantial gap between the researchand application of these methods.  One reason is that most of the designs are not practical for use in existing aircraft because they require a complete redesign of the software (control system) and, in some cases, additional hardware (sensors, flightcomputers, etc.).    The proposed work addresses many of the challenges associated with upgrading a production flight control system to improve capabilities of current Navy fleet aircraft.  Reconfiguration is accomplished by computing increments to thepilot's commands that remove unwanted motions during maneuvering with control surface failures, battle damage, and mechanical, electrical, or hydraulic problems.  This add-on (retrofit) control system is unobtrusive - i.e., it only generates nonzeroreconfiguration commands when the aircraft is responding unexpectedly.  Another key advantage of the approach is that the command limiting, structural filters, and safety logic of the production control system remain in effect.  This lessens certificationrequirements compared to other reconfigurable control methods.  Phase II will advance the technology through algorithm and software development, hardware implementation, and F/A-18 flight testing.",

A user will specify an objective (such as maximize runtime) and use conditions (such as the electrical current), and the software determines, based on first principles(trade mark) models, the optimal design. The Phase I project successfully yielded, based on optimization of capacity, significant improvements in runtime for devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs). The Phase II project will develop a user-friendly, prototype system that can handle multiple battery chemistries, simulate abuse testing, and predict battery life. The software serves as an intermediary between battery developers and users by capturing expertise from both groups, allowing them to accrue benefits of simulation. Aligning development cycles of batteries to devices leads to better products (with concomitant market penetration, share growth, and lower costs). The software protects confidential information of all parties, creating opportunities for broader partnerships. The commercial benefits will come from the development of the software, which provides a ready outlet for academic research and a rational basis for product specifications. It is anticipated that if this project is successful it will open up the battery industry to innovation and will help to create new partnerships",

        "abstract": "Abstract         We propose to develop a computationally efficient, potentially revolutionary method of modeling unsteady aeroelastic systems and controlling dynamic loads. Improving aerodynamic performance to meet the mission goals of next-generation civil/military aircraft and launch vehicles requires dramatically new methods of predicting and controlling nonlinear fluid-structure dynamics. The proposed innovation will provide a rational design tool for analysis and control of resonant fluid-structure interaction without compromising the effects of shocks, viscosity, separation, and shock-boundary layer interaction. Stability of a coupled fluid-structure system is accurately predicted in an eigenvalue formulation where eigenvalues correspond to coupled-system modal frequencies in the time domain and their growth rates. Limit cycle oscillations may then be computed and bifurcation diagrams constructed. The eigensystem formulation is tailored to accommodate state-of-the-art, frequency-based flow and structural controllers. The NASA Langley Aeroelasticity Branch and researchers such as Dr. Walter A. Silva maintain experimental aeroelasticity data from two programs-- Benchmark Active Controls Technology (BACT) and Actively Controlled Response of Buffet Alleviated Tails (ACROBAT)-- and these data will be used to validate the new computational method.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This SBIR Phase II project proposed to develop a new fabrication technology that would lead to ultra low-cost, high quality radial gradient refractive index (GRIN) rods, which are widely used in fiber optic communications.  Drastic cost reduction isexpected because several cost and labor intensive manufacturing processes will be eliminated, the product yield will be increased significantly compared to current existing technologies.  The estimated price for our new product is less than 20% of currentprice.  The major part of the cost reduction results from the extremely high productivity.  More than ten thousands radial GRIN rods could be fabricated from one preform with a diameter of 5cm and a length of 150 cm.  Importantly, this new fabricationtechnology also provides excellent reproducibility and an extremely high degree of flexibility in fabricating new types of radial GRIN rods.  This technology could have an enormous impact in both military and civilian-oriented optical communications,signal processing and medical imaging applications.  These low-cost radial GRIN rods will significantly expedite the realization of all optic communication networks for military and Fiber-To-The Home (FTTH).  This proposed radial gradient refractive indexglass rods can be used in the rapidly growing market of civil and military communication networks, sensor networks, computer data links, document reproduction, as well as medical imaging.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         We proposed a simple wafer scale method to leap frog current CMOS technology.  The slow-down in CMOS scaling is limited by technology difficulties and by economics.  In tooling up for .13-micron technology, the jump from .18-micron is costing $10 billionis equipment alone, plus accompanying expenses of redesign and module formulation.  The net effect of this massive capital investment is to replace 1.2GHz with 2.9GHz computers.  In the same arena we can take .018-micron technology and get 5GHZ with lessthan $5m development costs and perform the same advance (x4) on 13-micron technology to get over 11Ghz using the same equipment and technology.  Our tooling cost will be $500k.  Our technique uses mechanical strain and is inexpensive.  It is applied afterconventional IC fabrication is completed, taking full advantage of all the positive attributes of silicon (low cost, high transistor count, high reliability etc.)  Providing potential performance figures more normally associated with materials such asGaAs.  Initial results indicate performance levels associated with halving the channel length.  Benefits include reducing short channel effects and contact potentials.  Hence quadrupling the effective performance is possible for silicon ICs with minimalprocess development.  Our technique will extend the effective limit of scaling in microelectronics via changing the properties of silicon.  Cost comparison in terms of realizing the next generation of mainstream computer clock times: Industry: 1.3 to 2.9GHz, equipment along; $10,000,000,000.  Our Technology: 1.3 to 5 Ghz, equipment; $500000. Industry: 0.13-micron to sub 0.1-micron ... at present not technically possible.  Out Technology 1.3 to 11 GHz, $500,000.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Applicant's Abstract): Approximately 65 percent of manual               wheelchair users experience upper extremity pain or injury, which can                significantly impact their mobility and independence. Research has demonstrated      a relationship between impact stresses on the upper extremities during               wheelchair propulsion and upper extremity injury. Impact stresses occur when         the hand contacts the pushrim, transmitting the stresses to the wrist, elbow,        and shoulder. Current pushrim technologies do not effectively reduce these           impact stresses. The FlexRim consists of an innovative flexible interface            between the pushrim and wheel that reduces the impact stresses related to upper      extremity injuries. In Phase I, three FlexRim concepts were developed and            evaluated. The concepts allowed the pushrim to translate relative to the wheel,      lowering impact forces. Use of the FlexRim did not adversely affect propulsion       efficiency. In Phase II, the FlexRim design will be refined based upon Phase I       results. Biomechanical evaluations of impact loading and mechanical efficiency       will be conducted at the Pittsburgh Human Engineering Research Laboratories          with 15 subjects. Thirty wheelchair users will evaluate the FlexRim over a           three to six month period of use. Because the FlexRim reduces impact stresses        related to upper extremity injuries, it serves to prevent injury, and preserve       function and mobility.   PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The proposed wheelchair pushrim will potentially enhance the lives of all manual wheelchair users by reducing impact stresses on the upper extremities during wheelchair propulsion. The FlexRim will interface to most wheelchair wheels and will be sold as a standard wheelchair component or as an optional accessory.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many people who rely on specialized             wheelchair seating have difficulties attaining and maintaining proper pelvic         positioning, a critical component for achieving good sitting posture. Use of         commercially available devices often results in misalignment and areas of high       pressure. The objectives of this research project are to develop an innovative,      dynamic pelvic stabilization device, to demonstrate its effectiveness, and           evaluate its functional benefits through clinical trials. The HipGrip consists       of contoured pads that \"grip\" the pelvis to provide firm support while allowing      anterior/posterior tilting of the pelvis without losing position within the          wheelchair. The ability of the HipGrip to improve posture and maintain pelvic        positioning will be demonstrated through a clinical study involving 25               wheelchair users. The effects of the HipGrip on performance of functional            tasks, activities of daily living, and participation in school, vocational           and/or recreational activities will be assessed. The HipGrip will link the user      with the wheelchair to provide a stable base of support from which to perform        functional tasks without risk of falling out of the wheelchair. This will            potentially increase user independence.                                              PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The proposed dynamic pelvic stabilization device will potentially enhance the lives of  thousands of wheelchair users.  The system can improve posture, comfort and function.  This seating technology can also be applied to other rehabilitation equipment where dynamic  custom seating is desirable.",

Cohen. Phase I studies conducted by Beneficial Insectary showed that the Cohen diet in the Cohen food pack was superior in several key areas to the live insect diet currently used for commercial mass rearing of C. rufilabris. The goal of Phase II is to conduct necessary research and development for implementation of the USDA invention in commercial insectary mass-rearing. The objectives of Phase II are: 1. Mechanize production of the food packets: 2. Develop SOP's for commercial production of the diet and food packs. 3. Conduct paired comparison tests with C. rufilabris fed the two diet regimes - the manufactured diet and food packs vs. live insect diet - in commercial mass-rearing production and in the laboratory, and 4. Conduct economic/financial analyses of the relative costs/benefits/risks between the two diet regimes. Implementation of the Cohen diet and food pack will fulfill the national goal to bring USDA inventions to fruition in the commercial sector, and is expected to allow for increased productivity, reduced production, costs and broadened markets for Beneficial Insectary in the U.S. And abroad.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION: (Applicant's abstract) The objective of the proposed work is fast,      sensitive integrated clinical analyzers for the diagnosis of two metabolism          disorders, homocysteinuria and phenylketonuria (PKU). The assays are based on        microchip capillary electrophoresis with electrochemical detection. This format      has several advantages, including small sample requirements, fast analysis           times, and inexpensive manufacture of multiple chips. Electrochemical detectors      are ideally suited to microchip CE because they can be easily miniaturized and       integrated into the analysis system.                                                                                                                                      Monitoring phenylanlanine concentration in plasma samples of newborns is             required by law. The current assay has a relatively high rate of failure (1:70)      and requires instrumentation frequently not found in-house, especially in small      hospitals. High levels of homocysteine in plasma has been associated with            cerebrovascular, peripheral vascular, and coronary heart diseases. The assay         for homocysteine involves online reduction of the protein-bound homocysteine         with tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, separation by electrophoresis, and              electrochemical detection at a gold/mercury electrode. Phenylalanine will be         determined in plasma in a similar manner using a copper electrode. The chips         will be used with a portable analysis system based on a battery-powered high         voltage power supply, miniaturized potentiostat, and integrated data analysis        system. The chips we develop will generate a foundation for other clinical           assays based on electrochemical detection.        PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The current trend in clinical analysis is away form large centralized labs and  toward point of care testing. Thus, a compact device for performance of assays  for homocysteine and other clinically relevant animo acids in the clinic or physician's  office has large commercial potential. Recently, the American Heart Association  recommended homocysteine screening for patients at risk for cardiovascular  disease. This should lead to a large demand for accurate and cost-effective assays  for homocysteine similar to the current cholesterol screening assays. The development  of a small, fast and reliable assay for phenylalanine in blood will make it possible to  test infants quickly and accurately for PKU. The electrochemical based clinical analyzers developed here will provide a format that can be used for the development of a number  of other assays for clinically important analytes. What is demonstrated with homocysteine  and phenylalanine is just the beginning of a large array of clinical analyzers based on  microchip CEEC.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In Phase 1, the enzymatic reduction step        for stereoselective synthesis of chiral vicinal aminoalcohols was established.       Eight different ketoreductases were evaluated, including 5 ketoreductases that       were cloned and expressed during this project, and the enzymes were                  characterized for substrate and stereochemical preferences. Reduction of             2-substituted-beta-ketoesters, the key precursors for chiral aminoalcohols,          gave products of high enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. Recycle           numbers for nicotinamide cofactors of more than 5000 were achieved, leading to       favorable economic projections. In Phase 2 we will create a library of               stereoselective ketoreductase enzymes by mutagenizing cloned genes, enabling         the stereoselective reduction of beta-ketoesters spanning a broad structural         range. A cloning host will be developed that eliminates the need for antibiotic      resistance for plasmid maintenance, and production of ketoreductase enzymes          will be demonstrated in laboratory-scale fermentors. Reaction conditions will        be optimized using two-phase aqueous-organic systems to maximize volumetric          productivity for ketones that have limited solubility in water. The chemical         rearrangement to produce the aminoalcohol products will be demonstrated, and a       procedure based on the use of metal-affinity resins will be developed for            recovering the aminoalcohol products from the reaction milieu. Three                 commercially important chiral vicinal aminoalcohols will be produced in              multi-gram amounts to demonstrate the overall technology.

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goals of our research are to      develop new formulations of therapeutically important drugs using cochleates as      the delivery vehicle. Such formulations would have an improved route of              delivery (oral rather than injectable to improve ease of administration and to       reduce adverse effects of parenteral therapy), and lower toxicity, thereby           improving the safety profile of drugs. The SBIR Phase I advanced the                 development of a new formulation of amphotericin B (AmB) that has low toxicity       and allows the oral delivery of AmB. Oral amphotericin B cochleates showed           excellent activity in murine models of clinically relevant invasive fungal           infections: Disseminated candidiasis, disseminated aspergillosis, and central        nervous system cryptococcosis. The overall objective of this SBIR Phase II is        to further develop this new AmB cochleate formulation for the following target       indications: 1) Treatment of azole-susceptible and azole-resistant                   oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis in immunosuppressed patients, 2)            empiric therapy for presumed fungal infection in febrile, neutropenic patients,      3) treatment of selected patients with proven or probable invasive infections        due to Aspergillus species, Candida species, and other life-threatening              invasive fungal infections. To this end the following specific aims will be          investigated:                                                                                                                                                             1. To optimize cochleate AMB formulations (CAMB) as a commercially viable human      therapeutic by testing CAMB prepared with less expensive raw materials (mainly       phosphatidylserine) and simplified protocols.                                        2. To perform preclinical studies in a higher animal model.                          3. To determine the mechanism of drug delivery mediated by cochleate                 4.

Information on the neurophysiology of the sites of drug action in the brain          reward circuitry in animal models is critical for understanding the process of       addiction in brain and clarifying modes of therapeutic intervention designed to      block the craving and negative brain affect and mood characteristics of the          addiction process. The new technology will build on significant new advances in      fabrication of recording probes, which have recently made possible the               recording of impulse trains from large populations of single neurons in animal       models of addiction to drugs. One goal is to produce an advanced real time           software module for the Windows 2000 operating system capable of controlling         multiple behavioral chambers for testing potential medications for substance         abuse. A further aim will be to create a relational database for organizing the      control of experiments and accumulating all relevant experimental data. A            Website interface with JAVA- language active-server applications will enable         access to data in real time at remote sites on the Internet. An existing             software and hardware system for capturing data from multiple spike trains will      be significantly enhanced, redesigned, and greatly reduced in cost to allow          automated sorting and time stamping of waveforms from large populations of           neurons in the mesolimbic \"brain reward system\" during drug self administration      behavior. The goal is to allow neuron population recording to be achieved            routinely during studies of behavioral actions of candidate drug medications.        Technology developed will be used applications throughout basic and clinical         neurophysiology, including real time control of prosthetic robotics devices.         This project will lead to establishment of new procedures urgently needed for        evaluating efficacy and mode of action of therapeutic drugs for substance            abuse.                                                                                PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: This multichannel software/hardware data acquisition system will allow a new mode of testing of potential medication for substance abuse. The system is equally adapted to a wide range off application in clinical neuroscience and physiological study. The ability to acquire multichannel neuron activity is managed by a real time software module that is readily adapted to robotic control of prosthetic devices.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Applicant's abstract): In Phase I Research, a pressurized gas           thermocycler was fabricated and successfully used to amplify gene fragments          from human beta-globin (536 b.p.), Human Platelet Antigen (364 b.p.),                bacteriophage lambda (333 b.p.), and a bacterial pathogen, E.coli 0157:H7 (91        b.p. and 85 b.p. amplicons). In our fastest experiments, a short 85 b.p.             amplicon was amplified through 30 PCR cycles in 78 seconds.                                                                                                               The speed and thermal control of this device were limited by its simple 3-valve      configuration (hot gas valve, cold gas valve, throttle valve), flow                  conditioner, inadequate gas cooling, software, and lack of on-line DNA               detection optics.                                                                                                                                                         In Phase II Research, improved high performance 4- and 5-valve thermocyclers         will be fitted with on-line fluorescence detection optics. For short (less than      100 b.p.) amplicons, 30 cycles of amplification/detection will be carried out        in less than 60 seconds using pressurized Helium gas. Longer amplicons (100 to       500 b.p.) will be amplified in 1 to 4 minutes using pressurized air.                 Pressurized gas thermocyclers will enable DNA-based diagnosis of heritable and       infectious diseases on an unprecedented time scale.                                  PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The proposed method is ten times faster than the fastest commercially available hot-air  PCR thermocyclers; and 100 times faster than commonly used heat block thermocyclers.  Phase II Research will develop enabling technology for high-throughput-screening   capabilities, which can be applied to diagnostics, drug discovery, and functional genomics  related to heritable and infectious diseases.  There is very large and growing market for  high-speed PCR for medical/veterinary diagnostics, agribusiness, and biomedical research.",

Thoughextensive data on thetreatment of thedisease           exists in the mousemodel, no translation of the benchresearch to human patients      has ever occurred due inpart to the apparent rarity of MPS VII. The                  keylong-term objective of this research is thedevelopment of an enzyme               replacementtherapy for MPSVII patients. Thework will be accomplished by              developing a highly productive cell line in phase I followed by thedevelopment       of a complete commercial process in phase II. The strategy will exploit              existing facilities and procedures developed for MPS I enzyme replacement            program to rapidly move to theproduction of enzyme in GMP compliance. The work       would thus set thestage for filing of an IND and a clinical trial of enzyme          replacement therapy in MPS VII patients.

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant): Phantoms are routinely used for                 performance testing and quality assurance of nuclear imaging systems. Certain        complex phantoms are used to simulate realistic patient imaging systems and          diagnostic tasks, such as lesion detection. However, existing designs for such       phantoms have limited accuracy and reproducibility, and they are particularly        inconvenient to use. These limitations have restricted the widespread use of         such phantoms to research studies. In Phase I, we have produced a prototype          innovative phantom for testing lesion conspicuity, whose design overcomes the        above limitations. We have evaluated the performance of this phantom in nuclear      medicine scanners. We have found that this phantom produced images with the          expected lesion-to-background contrast ratio and with excellent uniformity, and      it was much easier to prepare than existing designs for such phantoms. In Phase      II, we will complete the development of a commercial-quality version of the          phantom. We will also develop phantoms based on this novel design for                evaluating attenuation correction and for simulating anthropomorphic                 structures. This research will lead to commercial products that will be very         valuable for routine quality assurance, for clinically relevant performance          comparisons between scanners, and for research studies.                              PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  This research will lead to commercial phantoms for nuclear medicine imaging that are  more accurate, reproducible, and convenient to use than existing phantoms.  The  phantoms will be used for acceptance testing, quality assurance, performance  comparisons, and research for SPECT and PET scanners.",

The proposed        ManRay software development will deliver user-friendly software for the              calculation of effective patient dose from all diagnostic x-ray procedures.          User input, requiring only a few seconds, will specify all characteristics of        the photon beam, type of examination, phantom gender and size. Full capability       of simulating planar radiography, CT (including non-contiguous slices and            gantry tilt) and fluoroscopy (including C-arm and table arrangements) will be        included. Calculations are performed via Monte Carlo simulation using a              state-of-the-art transport code available in the public domain. Simulation           times of only a few minutes lead to statistical accuracies of <3 percent for         organs directly in the path of the beam. BioMed Software's combination of            radiation physics and computer systems coding expertise and knowledge will           expand the Phase II effort to include additional phantom sizes, expanded CT          applications and fluoroscopy modeling. Also during Phase II extensive                in-phantom dose measurements will be obtained to demonstrate the extent to           which ManRay accurately calculates dose in both planar and tomographic               situations.                                                                                                 PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: This software will be of use to all Radiology departments in the country, and is also of potential use to hospitals internationally. Given the expected flexibility, ease of use, and time-savings approach of ManRay relative to existing approaches to organ dose determination, it is reasonable to assume a significant fraction of these departments will take advantage of the software. Other potential users include private radiological consultants and researchers.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Verbatim from the Applicant's Abstract): Pneumothorax refers to         air accumulation in the space between the lung and the chest wall. The many          potential causes include spontaneous rupture of small alveoli or blebs,              progression of inflammatory diseases, complications of diagnostic or                 therapeutic procedures, plus penetrating (e.g., knife or bullet) or blunt chest      trauma (e.g., motor vehicle accidents). It is estimated that over 50,000 cases       occur each year. Morbidity and mortality would be reduced with improved              diagnosis of pneumothorax. We propose development of an innovative technology        for immediate and accurate detection of this condition using (audible                frequency) sound waves. (This is now ultrasound, nor an imagining technology.)       The essential hypothesis is that sound travels through chest structures              differently when a pneumothorax is present, and that these changes are               diagnostic. The envisioned final product would display an answer as \"positive,\"      \"negative,\" or (rarely) \"indeterminate.\" The proposed device would be portable,      inexpensive, safe, and easy to use. The core method involves inputting an            acoustic signal into the mouth, and \"listening for\" changes at the chest wall        with computerized analysis of signals from an \"electronic stethoscope.\" It           would consist of a sound generator (\"speaker\"), acoustic sensors                     (\"microphones\"), plus signal processing and display units. The first generation      commercial device will be for incubated patients and use a notebook computer         studies aimed at optimizing the technique and demonstrating its utility under        likely use restrictions. Given the medical and cost advantages of the                technology, significant commercial potential is anticipated with purchase by         emergency departments, intensive care units, ambulances and military medical         units.

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project is designed to optimize and        extend the ultrathin coating technology demonstrated in the Phase I project,         which is aimed at facile, cost-effective, and broadly applicable thin-film           coatings for the passivation of biosensor and medical device surfaces.               Prevention of non-specific binding of proteins and other biomolecules is             important for a large variety of biomaterial, optical, electrical and                structural surfaces which suffer fouling (protein and cellular adhesion,             microbial proliferation, and pore plugging) from functioning in contact with         physiological fluids and pharmaceuticals. A new class of block copolymer             reagents was prepared and demonstrated to provide self-assembled monolayers          which can be photochemically fixed on the surface. After spontaneous formation       from aqueous coating fluid, the monolayer film on the hydrophobic surface is         stabilized through covalent attachment to the surface and in situ                    polymerization or crosslinking of diblock polymer molecules. The resulting           \"field of grass\" from the hydrophilic block inhibits biomolecule adsorption and      can provide attachment sites for desired biomolecules such as heparin. This          Phase II effort will synthesize improved test models of this new class of            multifunctional self-assembling monolayer molecules. \"Living polymerization\"         will be used to prepare these photoreactive macromer surfactants, which will be      use-tested on distal protection screens and hemodialysis membranes.     PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: This effort is expected to provide new reagents and coating methodology for distal  protection devices (thrombi collection screens) and hemodialysis membranes.    Almost one million patients need hemodialysis three times per week. These coatings  would provide reduced fouling and increased flux for microporous medical devices.  The proposed work will also extend the block copolymer technology to alternate  polymer backbones for increased lubricity and to biomolecule immobilization for  increased hemocompatibility, providing better coatings for a variety of medical  devices.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         60076        Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT), used for cancer treatment, is in need of new and improved boron containing drugs that have been shown to accumulate in tumors (Glioblastoma melanoma, etc.) and not in surrounding tissue.   This project will examine the extent to which a family of boron-containing cyclic amino acids are taken up by tumors and evaluate their promise as agents for use in clinical BNCT.  In Phase I, a series of new tumor seeking unnatural cyclic amino acids were designed, and two were prepared.  The materials were tested for toxicity in Balb/c mice and were found to be non-toxic.  One of the new boronated amino acids was used in a biodistribution study involving Balb/c mice bearing EMT-6 tumors on their dorsal hip area.  The results demonstrated that the reagent was taken up by the tumor while rapidly clearing from the blood.   Based on the selectivity of the first compound prepared in the new family of water soluble cyclic amino acids, a series of boronated unnatural amino acids will be prepared in Phase II, varying the position and chemical type of the boron.  These new boronated pharmaceuticals will be evaluated for tumor specificity using immune deficient mice bearing implanted tumors.  The materials will also be screened for toxicity.                 Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: If the tumor selectively of the new synthesized compounds is shown to be significantly higher than currently used BNCT compouds, there would be a new worldwide movement to utilize BNCT.  Given new facilities around the world for treatment, the commercialization opportunities of these compounds should be significant.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         There are many data acquisition systems available for neuroscientists interested in multi-channel neurophysiology but all use proprietary, independently-developed file formats for the acquired data. This creates several problems including difficulties in sharing data between laboratories and poor interoperability between equipment, data processing tools and spike classification software from different vendors. Moreover, neuroscientists wanting to develop their own data acquisition hardware or analysis software are forced to support a limited set of proprietary formats or create their own. In Phase I, Bionic Technologies, Inc. will work with all interested data acquisition companies and representative users to develop an open, industry-standard file format for neurophysiological data, create a web- based user forum to support this standard, and provide a C/C++ code library for importing and exporting data in the open format. In Phase II, the usability of the format will be increased by the development of public-domain, open-source software tools for: importing/exporting the data in various programming languages and between a variety of analysis environments; editing, splicing, annotating and reviewing experiment data in the standard file format; generating data files for analysis from simulation environments, and classifying spike waveforms with classical or custom algorithms. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The open file format for neural data developed in Phase I and the neural data management tools developed in Phase II will be made freely available to everyone on a neutral, non-affiliated web site. Researchers will also be able to use this site to exchange information and user- developed tools and techniques within an Open Source environment. Bionic Technologies, Inc. and other neuroscience equipment manufacturers will benefit from the increased research activity, and hence increased sales, enabled by this program.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The largest groundfish resource for Oregon commercial fisherman is Pacific whiting (Merluccius productus). This fishery is economically important to many rural, coastal communities and in 2000 over 60,000 metric tons of whiting were delivered to Oregon shore-based processors. Processing Pacific whiting generates very large amounts of carcass waste. Over 70 percent of the landed weight of fish is discarded and in recent years disposal of this material has become problematic and expensive. Presently, expansion of shore-based processing of whiting is unlikely without first solving the problem of waste disposal. One solution to this problem is to use Pacific whiting scrap as a raw material for higher value products. Our Phase I research successfully demonstrated that it is economically and technically feasible to convert whiting scrap into both hydrolyzed and non-hydrolyzed, high protein fish meals. The goal of our Phase II proposal is determine if converting Pacific whiting carcass waste into hydrolyzed and non- hydrolyzed high protein fish meal can be a profitable commercial endeavor. Our research will focus on how best to produce commercial scale quantities of consistent quality fish meals from whiting scrap that meet the nutritional and physical criteria for high value use in aquaculture agriculture and horticulture.",

We successfully proved our hypothesis and demonstrated concept          feasibility. The results of our Phase I study show that blood flow values            obtained from stable isotope-labeled microspheres compare favorably to values        obtained from radioactive microspheres. Phase 11 will develop new products and       systems to support our microsphere product-line and advance its commercial,          potential. Phase 11 will develop new microsphere labels using enriched isotopes      to maximize the sensitivity of the assay and to minimize the production of           activation products of the element. We will also extend this work to label           additional sizes of microspheres for uses in other areas of perfusion research.      We will characterize label concentration and evaluate microsphere label              stability over a range of conditions. In addition, Phase II will develop a           novel automated Compton-suppression, coincidence-counting system that will           improve the sensitivity and specificity of spectrographic analysis of complex        gamma-ray spectra following neutron activation. Finally, we will design and          characterize an automated sample delivery system to neutron activate large           numbers of samples. Construction will be a Phase III project funded by BioPAL.        PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Neutron activation-based assays can simultaneously track multiple stable-isotope labeled research products within in vivo system. This ability is of high interest to the biomedical research community. No current technology can provide this level of versatility.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Scanned from the applicant's description): Cryopreserved human          sperm are essential for important therapies. With standard procedures,               post-thaw quality of samples from many/most patients (donors are highly              selected) is unacceptable, 40 percent of the sperm are damaged, and pregnancy        rate is low. Biology to improve outcome is available, but unused because of          limited efforts to adapt knowledge to an approach practical in a clinical            setting. This project is focused on that goal and will use containers with           \"gated-pore\" faces and a \"rapid cryoprotectant removal device\" (RCRD) to             eliminate post-thaw damage to human sperm resulting from rapid movement of           water into the cells. Their use allows cryopreservation of sperm within a            sealed container, and post-thaw opening of the gated pores and, at a rate safe       for the sperm, replacement of cryo-extender with a buffer appropriate for            intrauterine insemination (IUI) and not irritating to tissues--automatically         and safely (for sperm and operator) without dilution or removal of sperm from        the container until IUI. Phase-I demonstrated feasibility.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The combination of phylogenetic proximity to humans and high levels of intraspecific genetic variation has already allowed successful identification of DNA sequence variation in Alzheimer Disease (AD)- related genes in chimpanzees during Phase 1. This Phase 2 proposal will develop. SNP genotyping capabilities for those polymorphisms and genotype pre-existing chimpanzee brain tissues and aged living chimpanzees. An ACT assay will be used to identify chimpanzees with probable dementia and demarcate phenotypes for a disease-oriented sequencing strategy in a small panel of chimpanzee DNA samples. We will identify variation at another five candidate genes thought to contain AD-related mutations in humans (A2M, tau, LPL, LRP2 and mtDNA). Characterization of polymorphisms will broaden our phylogenetic understanding of important human disease genes, help develop improved genotyping methods for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), advance investigation of gene/disease associations in AD and facilitate pharmacogenetic approaches to identifying potential AD- related pharmaceuticals. The genetic characterization of chimpanzee brain tissues will increase the value of our Great Ape Brain Bank. The study of a host of AD-related genes that seem to be involved in Ab formation and clearance can allow correlation of neuropathological studies with AD-related mutations for a phylogenetically informed understanding of the genetic basis of AD. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: This project will increase the scientific and commercial value of BIOQUAL's Great Ape Brain Bank by providing genotypic data on Alzheimer-related genes on the brain tissues in that collection. Further commercial value is gained by advancing our understanding of the relationship between AD-related genes, cognitive impairment, and neuropathology in a chimpanzee model of human neurodegenerative disease. Chimpanzees and chimpanzee brain tissues that have been characterized for AD-related genetic polymorphisms can be useful for post-mortem assessment of neuropathology related to AD or other neurodegenerative disorders. Living animals could potentially be treated with candidate pharmaceutical agents for their own welfare and translated into humans. Overall, this knowledge can help alleviate human suffering encountered by a growing fraction of the U.S. population and reduce the public health burden associated with AD and related neurodegenerative disorders in an aging population.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CAP-PAP Test (further: CPT) is a                double-staining, single-slide method for cervical cancer primary screening           based on a new biological marker of cervical dysplasia (US patent No. 6,143,512      of November 7, 2000). In phase-1 study (SBIR-NCI-NIH award No. 1R43CA86767-01)       the method was established as a research service in a cytopathology laboratory       (infrastructure: space, equipment, personnel trained for marker processing,          staining and interpretation). A clinical laboratory trial (BSC-9902) began to        study the accuracy of CPT in comparison with Pap test (adjudicated cytology          standard) in a low-risk population of women recruited at clinical sites. After       200 analyses, in comparison with a historical control (Pap test), CPR was shown      to increase perception of cytotechnicians performing primary screening and that      this increased ability can result in a reduction of false negatives and an           increase of true positives (ASCUS and above). After the method feasibility is        confirmed, we are proposing this phase-2 project \"CAP-PAP Test for Cervical          Cancer Screening\" to study, on 1,800 healthy women (three clinical sites), the       efficacy of CPT in comparison with Pap test (clinical outcome standard) to           predict occurrence and/or progress of cervical cancer or precancerosis. The          goal is to bring to public benefit a screening test that could improve accuracy      of Pap test, save many lives and reduce the cost of healthcare.                                                                                                           Successful completion of phase-2 study will warrant entering a                       commercialization in phase-3, The test is lowcost (approximately $1.00 above         the current cost of Pap test), consumer friendly (one day training), and             accurate (internal control) The new marker is complementary (not competitive)        to other technologies that have been recently developed to improve technical         weaknesses of the conventional Pap test. If successful, CPT could face a market      of 80 million requests per year.                                                     PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: NOT AVAILABLE",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Under this grant we propose to continue                       the development and application of a new class of fluorescence quenched probes       with optimized features for genetic analysis and quantitation. The enhanced          performance of our novel probes is by virtue of a set of high performance dark       quenchers we refer to as \"Black Hole Quenchers,\" or BHQs. The BHQ quenchers          have been designed to optimize quenching by two independent modes, 1) formation      of a ground state complex between the fluorophore and quencher leading to            quenching by non-FRET mechanism, and 2) maximize spectral overlap between the        fluorophore emission and quencher absorption to maximize FRET quenching, We          have prepared a set of three quenchers to provide effective quenching from 480       nm to 720 nm. BHQ probes will have several desirable features which                  differentiate them from currently available probes. First, BHQ probes have           extraordinarily low spurious noise (ie no non-specific reporter signal) and          thus have a very high signal to noise ratio (S/N). This property will result in      enhanced sensitivity and lower detection thresholds when compared with               currently available probes, thus fewer copies of gene targets will be                detectable. Secondly, BHQ probes will be more readily purified than                  conventional FRET probes and thus will be more cost effective to manufacture.        Since BHQs are \"dark\" quenchers they expand the available bandwidth thus             allowing the multiplexing of several different probes at once. BHQ quenchers         will improve the performance of virtually all FRET probe mediated assays,            including Taqman, Molecular Beacons, Sunrise Scorpions, and Invader.                  PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Self-quenching fluorogenic oligonucleotide probes have become important tools for the detection, quantitation, and discrimination of genetic matter. However current probe designs are difficult and expensive to prepare and often have extraneous noise which limits their usefulness. The new class of probes proposed here will be more economically manufactured and will have very low noise. It is estimated that probe cost will diminish from the current average of $400 per probe to less than $100 per probe, thus opening quenched probes to entirely new applications and markets.",

The Space Station will afford the protein crystal growth community the unprecedented opportunity to grow crystals in a microgravity environment for extended periods of time and then retrieve them. This will add a new dimension to determining the structures of hard to crystallize proteins such as membrane-bound proteins. To take full advantage of this opportunity, the BioSpace International Dynamically Controlled Crystallization System will be used as the basis of a system that will conduct a series of crystallizations and screens over extended periods of time. During this time the system will be monitored and controlled by the researchers via a laptop and the internet. Each of these systems will be completely compatible with all the Refrigerator/Incubator systems currently planned for the Space Station.The Phase I effort will include the analysis of protein crystals grown in space and on the ground using the concept proposed for the Space Station. In addition to the diffractometry analysis that will be performed at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory, there will be X-ray topographic analysis performed to determine the influence of microgravity and to analyze growth induced defects.",

The proposed system, Concentrated       Aerosol Delivery and Quantization System, CADAQS, will fulfill the need to           acutely deliver high particle number concentrations of aerosols to the               respiratory tract of small animals (rats, young rabbits, and guinea pigs: wt <                                    1000 g), while enabling the quantization of their deposition in the lungs. The       CADAQS consists of 3 subsystems. A) A two stage aerosol concentrator, TSAC,          concentrates aerosols of 1-5 pm AMMD. B) A Small Animal Aerosol Delivery             System, SAADS, a zero-dead space nose cone incorporated into a whole body            plethysmograph complete with sensors and data acquisition and analysis system.       C) A Quantitative Aerosol Deposition System, QADS, utilizes a pair of 4              pixelated CdZnTi detectors with integrated ASIC placed laterally to each lung.       In Phase I, we successfully constructed the TSAC prototype. In this Phase II         project, we will construct the complete CADQAS system so that prototypes of          commercial systems can be generated. The system will be tested using rats. The       TSAC, the SAADS, and the QADS are designed to be sold as stand-alone devices as      well as components of CADAQS. Such a system is not available commercially. This      system will be used for environmental and occupational toxicology. It will also      greatly facilitate the processes of drug discovery, toxicology and pharmacology      through the delivery of drugs to the respiratory tract for both local and            systemic drug delivery.

Such a system should be      as effective for emergency contraception as the currently approved oral method,      while offering greater convenience and fewer side effects. Although the              required transdermal dose is high for a drug as insoluble as levonorgestrel,         BIOTEK's past experience suggested that it could be achieved. Phase I began          with an in vitro study on human skin to confirm and optimize high                    levonorgestrel fluxes, continued with a study of irritation and bioavailability      in rabbits, and concluded with an evaluation of materials for use in                 comfortable patches capable of maintaining good skin contact over a large area.      These tasks were successfully completed. The Phase II work proposed here will        complete patch design work, prepare and characterize GMP patches, submit an          IND, and conclude with a 10-subject human clinical dose ranging study of             safety, follicular response, and levonorgestrel pharmacokinetics at the Jones        Institute of the Eastern Virginia Medical School.

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant): Although breast feeding by                  HIV-infected women is known to increase the risk of mother-child transmission,       the culture of breast feeding is not likely to change soon. The relationship         between viral load (VL) and transmission is critical and requires careful            quantitative studies and systematic and vigorous monitoring of VL in breast          milk of women (i) to identify the number of women who constantly shed virus and      (ii) to prove the utility of reducing the VL in milk and HIV transmission to         babies by a short course of anti-viral drugs. Currently, the routine monitoring      of HIV-infected breast feeding women and their infants in developing countries       is cost prohibitive and new inexpensive technology for early detection,              diagnosis and accurate monitoring of treatment efficacy is necessary. BIOTRACES      Inc. has developed a Multiple Photon Detection immunoassay (IA/MPD) for HIV-l        p24 protein which is 1,000-fold more sensitive than standard assays. In Phase        I, an improved p24 IA/MPD enabled robust quantitation of H1V-l with a                sensitivity comparable to current PCR based assays, i.e. sensitivities               equivalent to 10 virions per ml. The aim of Phase II is to develop a clinically      relevant, ultra high sensitivity, low cost, quantitative p24-based VL assay for      use in developing countries. To achieve this, an IA/MPD with a sensitivity of 5      fg per ml or 50 virion per ml, will first be optimized for the detection and         quantitation of Clade C p24 and used for measuring (a) VL from breast milk and       plasma from treated and untreated African women in Zimbabwe (a HIVNET 023            Study) and Zambia (pending study) (b) for the early detection of very low viral      copies in infants born to seropositive mothers. Parallel VL measurements on          aliquots of the same samples, using the Roche assay, will allow a direct             comparison between the RNA-based and the less expensive p24 -based technology.       This assay will also be used for VL testing of HIV-l Clade B-infected                individuals as a first step towards a commercially viable assay.

Discovery of novel non       cytotoxic L-nucleosides with potent anti-HBV activity that, when used in             combination, act synergistically is described. These L-nucleosides are reported      to inhibit the viral DNA polymerase and replication without effect upon              cellular polymerases or mitocohndrial function and have been shown to                significantly reduce viral load in the chronic woodchuck hepatitis model.            Funding from SBIR phase 1 and 2 will be used to select and develop the               combination of the L-nucleosides with the greatest potential for                     commercialization. Phase 1 will determine pharmacology, toxicology and               antiviral potency of two and three L nucleoside combinations in the woodchuck        chronic hepatitis model.

Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is caused by mutations in          genes encoding proteins involved in MMR, and defects in MMR have also been           observed in sporadic cancers.  DNA sequence analyses of the alterations in MMR       genes in HNPCC kindreds has revealed that more than 25% are missense codons          resulting in single amino acid replacements.  It is not possible to                  unambiguously assign these as either mutations or silent polymorphisms without       data on the in vivo function of the variant proteins.                                                                                                                     Phase I research validated the use of functional genetic tests of DNA mismatch       repair in yeast to determine the significance of amino acid replacements             observed in human MMR proteins.  In addition to identification of silent             polymorphisms and mutations, certain amino acid replacements were shown to           result in altered efficiency of MMR.  Phase II research will further develop         this technology for the purpose  of retrospective and prospective analyses of        the functional consequences of amino acid replacements in human MMR proteins.        Data generated with this technology will allow accurate interpretation of            genetic tests for HNPCC, sporadic cancers and common polymorphisms in MMR            genes.

In a Phase I SBIR for AFRL, Black & Ryan Engineering (BRE) developed VAWCS (Voice Authenticated Wireless CommunicationSystem), a computer model of a Communications Waveform, combining Voice Authentication, Speech Compression, Encryption, and Forward Error Correction for narrowband wireless communication over a SATCOM Channel.  BRE now proposes a Phase II SBIR project to:    Formally specify and initially implement a new adaptive packetization protocol called SWAP (Secure Wireless Adaptive Protocol) designed to:     A. Enhance the flexibility of VAWCS, allowing users to selectively specify features for flexible communication, and     B. Serve as a generalized adaptive communication framework for the Air Force's Joint Battlespace Infosphere (JBI) Program.    Implement the VAWCS Waveform Model on Motorola's Software Defined Radio / Wireless Information Transfer (SDR / WITS) platform, using the WITS 4800 Baud satellite communications (SATCOM) Radio Waveform Data Mode.  BRE will:1. Develop streaming data CORBA interfaces between VAWCS components,2. Port the VAWCS model to the WITS platform,3. Integrate an initial implementation of the SWAP Protocol for VAWCS, and4. Test the system in the presence of simulated/real background and channel noise.",

Pressure-tolerantbatteries can increase an AUV's effective energy capacity by 50%to 100%, with no reduction in vehicle payload and no increase invehicle size.  To get a corresponding increase in capacitythrough improvements in electrochemistry or cell manufacturingwould require investing many millions of dollars over many years,with no guarantee of success.  In our Phase I effort we performedthe first systematic testing of appropriate cells under deepocean ambient pressure. Our results are promising. COTS cellsunderwent many electrical cycles at high rates (nominally C/2)while under isobaric conditions of over 6,700 psi, with noevidence of pressure-induced failures in either set of cells.Thus, there exist today COTS cells that can be used to build ahigh-capacity pressure-tolerant battery pack for Navy vehicles.For our Phase II effort we propose to engineer a pressure-tolerant battery pack based on the current state-of-the-art COTScells. Furthermore, the pack will be designed to allow it toreadily accept improved cells as they become commerciallyavailable",

(ID), proposes to develop a novel continuous wave cavity ringdown spectroscopy (CW-CRDS) instrument to measure the single-scatter albedo (SSA) of aerosols and clouds. The instrument will measure both the scattering and the extinction coefficients, and will thus be able to determine the single-scatter albedo directly in an integral, compact unit. In Phase I, we will demonstrate the feasibility of our design through a working desktop prototype. If funded in Phase II, we will design, build, test, and deliver an Advanced Prototype to NASA for testing that will be robust enough to use aboard aircraft to make in situ measurements. It will represent a significant advance in the state of the art in atmospheric aerosol measurements, employing an internal effective path length of several kilometers (compared with 20 m, the current state of the art). Phase III will result in a commercial instrument. Besides the importance of these measurements in studying and modeling the climatic effects of aerosols and clouds, we anticipate commercial applications in the monitoring of pollution, air quality, and industrial clean rooms. We also see a large potential market for monitors for domestic security agencies to detect aerosol dispersed biological warfare agents.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION: (Investigator's abstract) Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony                 Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) is a cytokine that stimulates proliferation and          differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Recombinant human GM-CSF is       used to stimulate neutrophil production in patients with neutropenia resulting       from myelosuppressive chemotherapy. Recombinant human GMCSF had world-wide           sales of approximately $100 million during 1997, a 20 percent increase from          1996. We propose to create modified GM-CSF proteins that are equal or superior       to natural GM-CSF at stimulating granulocyte/monocyte formation In vivo, but         which require less frequent dosing, on the order of once per week or once every      other week. During Phase I we identified sites in GM-CSF that can be modified        without affecting the protein's in vitro bioactivity. During Phase II, we will       manufacture sufficient quantities of the modified GM-CSF proteins for testing        in animal models of neutropenia. The improved characteristics of the novel           GM-CSF proteins will reduce the amount of GM-CSF required per patient, improve       patient compliance and quality of life and result in considerable cost savings       to patients and healthcare providers. Information gained from these studies          will aid in creating long-acting versions of structurally related cytokines and      growth factors for use in treating cancer, infectious disease and hematopoietic      disorders.                                                                           PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  Recombinant human GM-CSF is used to restore neutrophil production in patients with  neutropenia resulting from chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation.  Recombinant  GM-CSF had world-wide sales in excess of $100 million in 1997.  The modified GM-CSF  proteins under development will require much less frequent dosing, providing significant  cost savings to patients and healthcare providers.  Additional potential benefits include  improved drug efficacy and improved patient quality of life.",

Unfortunately the state-of-the-art in SLMs still limits the overall performance of the opticalcorrelators.  These limitations include operating speed and optical efficiency.  Boulder Nonlinear Systems (BNS) proposes to draw on its expertise in the development of high-speed SLMs to develop a high-speed bipolar multi-level SLM.  The key is developinga very high-speed SLM that also has high optical efficiency when used as a bipolar multi-level modulator.  During Phase I we have analyzed new Liquid Crystal (LC) materials, and developed a conceptual design for a high-speed, high-efficiency bipolarmulti-level 256x256 SLM.  During Phase II, the new 256x256 SLM and associated drivers will be fully developed.  In addition, we will develop an optical correlator system utilizing the new bipolar high-speed 256x256 multi-level SLMs.  This opticalcorrelator system will be delivered at the end of the Phase II.  As the only supplier of high-speed multi-level LC SLMs, and a developer of optical processing systems for over 10 years, BNS is highly qualified to complete this program.",

The success of these devices ultimately rests in the capabilities of the liquid crystal material.  Phase II research will concentrate on the development ofhigh-speed, analog switching ferroelectric liquid crystal materials and their application in agile tunable notch filters.  Toward this end, BNS will team will researchers at the Liquid Crystal Institute at Kent State University.  FLC-based tunable filtersoffer low-power, continuous tuning, excellent image quality and aperture, rapid response speeds and large field-of-view.  BNS will produce tunable filter in the visible, and will pursue extension of the technology into the mid-IR band.",

The source will be capable of producing beams in the range from boron to uranium.  In Phase I, computer simulations were performed to study the inner source geometry in order to determine the arrangement of components in the source.  Inner source optics, extraction optics, and transport were also examined with the computer simulations.  Experimental studies were conducted to test negative ion transport without destruction as well as cathode materials and methods for negative ion production.   Phase II will build a test stand and DC and pulsed sources will be designed, built, and characterized based on the Phase I studies.   Beam brightness will be measured and tested for negative ion transport in a plasma channel.   Cathode materials and methods will be tested for producing different ion species.                            Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: Negative ion sources are needed for research as injectors into tandem accelerators and also used in industry for high energy ion implantation. There are more than 100 industrial tandem accelerators that would benefit from refrofitting this ion source.  In addition, there are important advanced energy and defense applications that require high brightness ion sources",

(BRDI) and its subcontractors have successfully completed a Phase I SBIR evaluation of existing test automation software and training tools.  The results of this evaluation show that there is substantial potential toreduce material and product development cycle time through the use of more sophisticated automation systems and better learning and training methods.  Advanced instrumentation and methodologies produce more information of higher quality from a given test,leading to better understanding of the damage and failure processes involved.  Improved learning and training methods maximize the understanding and capability of researchers and technicians.  This leads to higher test throughput and further improvesinformation quality.We used Phase I results to devise a comprehensive development plan for WinMATE, an advanced test automation package and set of sophisticated learning tools.  We have obtained commitments from industry leading companies for substantial assistance andsupport throughout the Phase II SBIR activity.  We propose to use the combination of our development plan, substantial industry experience and financial commitment to produce a complete, sophisticated test automation system including learning and trainingtools.  These products will greatly reduce material and product development cycle time and cost both in Government and commercial applications.",

To address this need, Busek proposes to develop a Hall thruster with increased performance, reduce mass, reduced complexity and lower cost over state-of-the-art ion propulsion systems. In Phase I, using an existing nominally 2 kW thruster we propose to evaluate several innovative methods of achieving high efficiency, high Isp performance, including two-stage thruster concepts. Also in Phase I we will design a two-stage magnetics thruster to be built and tested in Phase II. Achieving the targeted 3200 sec Isp, 100 mN thrust at 2.3 kW thruster input power will result in a significant reduction in propulsion system wet mass at higher thrust density than grided ion engines.In Phase II, the most promising approach for achieving the targeted performance will be selected for further optimization. At the conclusion of Phase II, Busek will deliver to NASA an advanced laboratory prototype thruster for independent performance testing.",

In an attempt to control this disease, the seed industry has adopted a zero tolerance of infected seeds. Available tests for detecting infected seeds include grow-out, liquid plating, classical PCR tests. These tests are either not sensitive enough, resulting in false negative, not specific enough, resulting in false positives, or are very time consuming. A newly developed Bio-PCR test works well for many seed lots, as evident from our Phase I results. Success of Bio-PCR, however depends on many factors including efficient extraction of pathogen from seeds, maintaining viability during extraction, enrichment, extraction of high quality DNA and availability of good primers. To rule out false PCR positives, classical PCR product should be further identified with a specific probe (Southern hybridization). We intend to accomplish this in Phase II by adoption of TaqMan technology (Smart Cycler) that provides increased sensitivity, real time PCR detection and hybridization in an automated process. The TaqMan technology will make seed assays COST effective and reliable. NO separate SOUTHERNS ARE NEEDED! Our consultant has recently made TaqMan primers and probes made available to us.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Advanced EFP warheads provide a number of modeling challenges that must be handled well to make designs feasible, but are very difficult to accomplish with current state of the art, general purpose solver technology.  The principal challenge has recentlymoved to user interface problems as it takes too long for models to be prepared and parameter studies cannot be completed in a reasonable amount of time.  Additionally, there are some challenges in EFP, particularly related to fracture and adaptivity,which are not addressed in any current solvers.Previous work has shown that a Java based software system allows us to address many of these difficulties in modeling.  For example, a specialized EFP modeling system has been able to reduce user efforts from one week to develop a model to a few minutes.Modifications that required days can be reduced to seconds.  The object oriented nature of the system has also allowed us to develop unique solver techniques that speed the simulations over traditional solvers.The major effort in this project will be dedicated to developing fracture algorithms that are suited to the needs of EFP modeling.  The particular challenge is to produce an efficient method for separating liners into multiple penetrators.  Otheractivities will involve the implementation of advanced automatic optimization procedures.",

One of the major cost drivers for these devices is the high operating voltage.  Not only are the power supply costs significant, but the high voltage leads to increased circuit length, higher radiation hazards, larger insulating ceramics, and increased problems with high voltage breakdown.  This project will develop a capability to design and manufacture multiple beam guns for RF sources operating at power levels exceeding 75 MW at beam voltages less than 200 kV.  Highly efficient, solid sate power supplies will be utilized, which will dramatically reduce the costs of accelerator and collider systems, as well as reduce problems with high voltage breakdown and radiation shielding.   Phase I addressed all the major issues related to the computational design of multiple beam guns for RF sources producing more than 50 NW of RF power.  Simulations predicted that the configurations developed should provide high quality electron beams for efficient RF generation at considerably lower beam voltages than currently possible.   Phase II will complete the development and experimentally test multiple beam guns producing 100-200 NW of beam power.                       Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The reduction in beam voltage should dramatically lower the cost of RF sources for many proposed accelerator and collider systems.  Reduced beam voltage would also result in increased RF bandwidth, which would have major applications for radar systems.  The beam voltage reduction would allow implementation in systems and platforms where high voltage operation is not desirable or possible",

        "abstract": "Abstract         60176          Current high power gyrotron tubes, used for heating fusion plasmas, produce power in high order TE modes, which are converted to a Gaussian like mode through use of an internal mode converter and launcher.  However, these converter systems typically achieve only 85-90% efficiency for conversion of cavity output power to a usable Gaussian mode, leading to significant efficiency degradation.  Current analysis software used to design the mode converter and launcher system are based on approximations that  limit solution accuracy, thereby limiting the ability to achieve designs with high efficiency.  This project will develop an exact integral formulation of the problem that will allow for the design of high efficiency converter/launchers.   In Phase I, an exact magnetic field integral equation analysis computer code, which used the forward-backward method for an iterative solution, was developed.  Using this code, calculations for a test launcher had excellent agreement with measurements, demonstrating the feasibility and accuracy of the integral equation approach.  In Phase II, an advanced engineering code for the converter/launcher analysis will be developed that uses integral formulation analysis and techniques to minimize the computational load.  A high-efficiency mode converter and launcher system for use in a high average power DOE gyrotron will be designed.                 Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: Successful development should increase the efficiency of Gaussian mode gyrotrons used for plasma heating in fusion devices.  The technique should also be applicable to other overmoded, high-power microwave components such as waveguide converters, power combiners, elbows, and mirrors.  These components have applications in research and medical accelerators, materials processing, and high-power millimeter wave radars.",

Without this design capability, it is not possible to develop many new, innovative devices that could dramatically advance the state-of-the-art in charged particle electronics for commercial, research, and defense applications.  This project will develop an advanced charged particle code that will incorporate finite element, adaptive meshing.  This will reduce the computational requirements so that real-world, three-dimensional (3D) problems can be analyzed on desktop computers.  The computer program will include an intuitive graphical user interface and geometrical input using a state-of-the-art computer aided design (CAD) engine.  In Phase I, all major elements of the proposed program were developed to the point of demonstrating feasibility.  Significant advances were achieved in adaptive meshing technology and application of Monte Carlo Techniques for modeling secondary emission.  Interaction between a CAD-based graphical user interface and finite element mesh generator was demonstrated.  In Phase II, the major elements of the code will be completed, and additional features will be implemented to provide the functionality required to meet foreseeable applications.

Successful development will result in devices that require significantly less input power, require less cooling, have reduced weight, and improved mode purity than current devices. Calabazas Creek Research, Inc. (CCR) is proposing to develop the first BWOs with a depressed collector, spent beam energy recovery system that will reduce the prime power requirement and allow air cooling instead of water cooling. An additional goal will be to develop mode converters between the the slow wave sturcture and the the overmoded output to allow for single mode operation. Finally, advanced permanent magnet technology will be applied to reduce the magnet and system weight.BWO sources are presently used for ground based atmospheric sensing of trace chemicals, testing of solid state sensors, and for basic spectroscopy research. The innovative development proposed here will allow these devices to be used for airbourne or space atmospheric sensing missions, as well as reduce the cost and complexity of BWO sources, making their unique tunability and output power capability more accessible to both private and government laboratories.",

Diagnosis and post-treatment follow-up are currently      performed by karyotype, Southern blotting, or PCR, which have problems with          specificity and sensitivity. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)               addresses these limitations; however, no clinically tested FISH probes are           available for detecting the t(14; 18) translocation. Phase I research developed      novel probes for interphase FISH analysis of the t(14; 18) translocation. Using      both normal and tumor samples, high sensitivity and specificity of the probes        were observed. Using tumor specimens from multiple tissue types, Phase II            research will validate use of the probes for diagnosis. Phase II research will       also validate their use for monitoring minimal residual disease. In Phase II         research, the probes will also be optimized to reduce background hybridization       signal.

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to implement a Combustion Chemical Vapor Deposition (CCVD) process for the production of anode electrocatalyst layers for Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) applications requiring reformate fuel feed gas. In Phase I it was demonstrated that fabrication of Pt:Ru electrocatalysts as unsupported, metallic nanoparticles is possible using CCVD. These electrocatalyst layers behave electrochemically in a similar manner to commercially available Pt:Ru electrocatalysts prepared on carbon supports using wet chemical methods, but can be deposited directly onto both gas diffusion media and proton exchange membranes. The Phase II project would involve optimization of catalyst composition, continued development of web coating technology for mass production of membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) and commercialization of the technology through construction of production equipment and licensing. Fuel cells are of huge interest to the marketplace, as illustrated by sizable investments in the technology and market capitalization of fuel cell companies. For example, Daimler Chrysler has targeted the year 2004 for planned production of fuel cell vehicles, and has slated more than $1.4 billion in investments to reach that goal. However, for commercial viability, performance and cost of the electrocatalyst layers must be improved. MCT, if successful, could contribute in both arenas.",

The proposed Phase II effort focus is the additional research and development needed to increase the level of maturity and to reduce the risk in the application of our Phase I SiCmotor drive technology. To increase the level of maturity of our Phase I SiC motor drive technology, it is proposed to increase the power rating and operating temperature of the power electronics and to add sensor-less control to the control electronics.To reduce the risk in the application of our Phase I SiC motor drive technology, it is proposed to integrate the motor drive with a switched reluctance motor in Mechatronic Systems' laboratory. The specific objectives of the program are the design of anengineering prototype silicon carbide motor drive, the fabrication and testing of the hardware and software for the motor drive, and the subsystem integration tests.",

Thus, design of          IL-5 receptor antagonists that block pulmonary eosinophil disorders and present      a new approach to treating allergic asthma. In Phase I, we used SBI technology       to compute a 3-D dynamic model from the crystal structure of IL-5 and construct      pharmacophore templates to screen large scale compound libraries in order to         identify potential inhibitors of IL-5 action. Three compounds showing Ki             greater than 10 uM in an IL-5 receptor plate assays were obtained. The goal of       Phase II is to perform computationally guided synthetic optimizations of active      lead compounds identified in Phase I and to discover selective and potent drug       candidates active in a murine model for allergic asthma. The long term goal of       this project is to develop at least one non-peptide IL-5 receptor antagonist as      a potential anti-asthmatic and anti-allergic agent.

It      is associated with poor prognosis, chemoresistance, and aggressive and               metastatic tumor growth. Herceptin, a humanized monoclonal antibody to HER2, is      currently available for treatment of metastatic breast cancer validating HER2        as an effective target for breast cancer treatment. However, problems                associated with the use of antibodies as therapeutic agents are well known.          Structural Bioinformatics Inc. used patented and proprietary drug design             capabilities to extract 3D-pharmacophore structural information from                 computationally modeled dynamic protein HER2 kinase and used the pharmacophore       information from this model to prescreen large-scale compound libraries for          inhibitors of HER2 activity. Nine compounds showing IC50's < 20 uM in                functional assays were obtained. The goal of Phase II is to perform                  computationally guided synthetic optimization and refinement of active lead          compounds identified in Phase I and to discover selective and potent drug            candidates active in various HER2 preclinical tumor models for advancement into      clinical development. The long-term goal of the project is to develop a              non-peptide potent and selective Herceptin-like drug for the treatment and           prophylaxis of HER2 oncogene-mediated transformation, tumorigenesis, and             metastasis                                                                                                                                                               PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Not Available",

We have also demonstrated the potentials and limitations of these antennas.      During Phase II, we propose to develop the unique modeling tools which could be used by a variety of users including ourselves for the development of various multiband and broadband antennas using fractal structures.  We investigate various technicalissues associated with the development of plasma elements.  We then proceed to develop a prototype fractal antenna with multiband and broadband characteristics.  The antenna is being developed for spaceborne and airborne platforms and has conformalstructure.  The antenna characteristics can be reconfigured using plasma elements.

        "abstract": "Abstract         60028       The world supply of light crudes and those having only minor concentrations of sulfur and contaminant metals is quickly decreasing, and the refining of heavier crudes produces bottom of the barrel residual oils. These oils are unsuitable for conventional processing techniques such as catalytic cracking and therefore require an alternative process for upgrading. This project will develop a residual oil purification process based on the use of unique, low-cost ceramic membranes to separate residual oils into two fractions: (1) a product stream in which asphaltenes and metals are reduced to the level where this stream can be processed by cat cracking, and (2) a reject stream that can be disposed of in the same manner as residual oil.   Laboratory experiments in Phase I demonstrated that the ceramic membranes can achieve the required purification  at economically attractive filtration rates.  In Phase II, extensive laboratory scale experiments will be conducted to optimize the operating variables.  A pilot plant will be built and operated on alternative residual oil feedstocks.  Lastly, more extensive investment analyses will be performed to validate the Phase I economic studies.                 Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The process should be applicable to the treatment of both atmospheric and vacuum residual oils.  The process will also be useful for purification of waste lubricating oils, dewaxing petroleum products, removal of catalyst fines from hydrocarbon streams, and other filtration applications for heavy oils.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         60817          In the past few decades, Fischer-Tropsch technology has emerged in the United States as a leading technology for natural gas processing.  However, because roughly 60 percent of proven natural gas reserves in the world are categorized as remote or stranded gas, there is need for Fischer-Tropsch technology that can economically access remote natural gas reserves.   This project will develop a novel membrane reactor for the production of hydrocarbons from hydrogen and carbon monoxide via Fischer-Tropsch synthesis with a production capacity per unit volume of reactor that is superior to current technology options.  The feasibility of the membrane reactor was demonstrated in Phase I.  Active Co-based catalysts were prepared, characterized, and tested in both a tubular, fixed-bed reactor and a prototype of the proposed membrane reactor. Preliminary experimental data and engineering calculations indicate that the potential production capacity per unit volume exceeded that of both fixed-bed and slurry reactors.   Phase II will scale-up, develop, and optimize the novel reactor demonstrated in Phase I.  An aggressive work plan to address critical technical issues related to reaction kinetics, mass transfer, heat transfer, and reactor hydrodynamics will be undertaken.                Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The technology should provide a novel method for converting remote natural gas to clean fuels and chemicals.",

Several flow control methodologies have been proposed and appliedsuccessfully to a generic fighter aircraft to reduce the twin-tail buffet responses.  A new method of flow control using normal leading-edge blowing has been devised in Phase I and it has produced the most favorable results.  The goal of Phase II study isto develop and validate a computational analysis capability for the control of buffet responses of modern fighter aircraft.  Due to the availability of flight and experimental data through our collaborators from Boeing and NASA LaRC, the F/A-18 fullaircraft will be used as the test bed for Phase II work.  A comprehensive parametric study of flow control effects on the buffet responses will be carried out.  Active smart-structure control using Piezoelectric actuators will also be investigated.Eventually, the combined effects of flow control and active structure control will be investigated.  The structure dynamics module will be upgraded to three-dimensional nonlinear finite-element module in order to model the piezoelectric actuators.  Theproposed Phase II effort will result in a state-of-the-art multi-disciplinary design methodology to control buffet responses of a new generation of fighter aircraft.",

Development of advanced CFD analysis in Phase I provided the unique capability to simulate the non-Newtonian fluid flow aspects of the gel mixing process.  CFD simulations in Phase II will be critical to analyzingand optimizing the mixing process or exploring new mixing configurations.Phase II will work toward the design and test of two five gallon propellant mixing systems, one each for the fuel and oxidizer.  Fundamental rheological data will be developed to benchmark the CFD code, which will then be used to optimize the componentperformance.  CFDRC will examine additional instrumentation, sensing systems and control techniques to both improve the gel mixing and automate the batch process.CFDRC will coordinate the gel propellant definition with TRW and AMCOM FMTI development personnel throughout Phase II to insure all propellant specifications meet or exceed program requirements.  CFDRC's Huntsville location provides convenient access tothe AMCOM facilities and personnel, resulting in close coordination of software, hardware and controller development.

Those power supplies that do mount on pumps do not have serial control or adequately processed current reporting.  This project will develop a modular vacuum ion pump power supply with long-mean-time-between-failures.  The power supply will use radiation hard parts and will mount on the pump connector, eliminating high voltage cables.

In spite of the apparent pervasive need for video enhancement techniques, progress has been limited to either human-assisted video clean-up or to veryspecific types of automatic video correction.In our Phase I effort we have developed a limited prototype of RAVE: Real-time Autonomous Video Enhancement system. In Phase II we propose to develop and validate a full-scope prototype of RAVE as a real-time embedded system. We describe the existing suiteof RAVE's video enhancement and artifact detection algorithms. The algorithm selection is autonomously controlled by the situation assessment-based agent, called RAVE Agent. We present a scalable unified software architecture which will function as aframework for testing and rigorous validation in Phase II. We also present our commercialization plans.",

Feasibility of MARAD wasdemonstrated under the Phase I effort, in which we developed a sequential learning component that supports the capturing of user interactions with the visualization interface to identify user habits and to create preference profiles for adaptive displays.The learning component was also used to analyze battlefield event sequences to generate rules to predict significant tactical events.  We embedded the learning component within our in-house BattleField Viewer (BFV), which provided visualization andinteraction services for MARAD, in a complex battlefield simulation environment.Under Phase II, we propose to fully develop MARAD by: 1) expanding its capabilities across multiple scenarios; 2) expanding the functionality of its learning component to generate enhanced user profiles and event rules; and 3) introducing into MARAD a datafusion component and a situation assessment component to facilitate enhanced learning of the battlefield context. We will develop and implement MARAD based on our in-house BattleField Viewer (BFV) and CHI Systems' C3Core. We will investigate compliance ofMARAD with the Joint Technical Architecture (JTA).",

To address this need, we propose to develop a full-scope prototype HBR basedon SAMPLE, our agent-based cognitive architecture, which has already overcome the significant hurdle of being integrated in a high-fidelity air combat simulation.  We propose a three-phase effort:  1) Improve the representational fidelity of SAMPLE byproviding for an explicit model of multi-tasking and a principled means of accounting for individual differences and cultural factors; 2) Enhance the usability of SAMPLE via the continued development of a Graphical Agent Development Environment (GRADE) tosupport improved SAMPLE development, verification and visualization; and 3) Integrate the SAMPLE/GRADE/HBR Toolkit into a working USAF air combat simulation environment for validation and demonstration of overall utility in a Test and Evaluation (T&E;)exercise.",

Our objective in this effort is to develop an Agent-based Semantic DataManagement and Visualization (ASDMV) system that provides Geographic Information System (GIS) services, sensor data interpretation and advanced event visualization to support situational awareness in Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT). In Phase Iwe demonstrated the general feasibility of the approach in the context of a personnel rescue scenario. The ASDMV prototype supported sensor interpretation via interactive sensor agents using rule-based approaches, and efficient information delivery usingevent-centric visualization.In Phase II, we propose to expand ASDMV's capability for enhanced situation awareness by integrating robust GIS technologies for MOUT environment representation and state-of-the-art rule-based technology for sensor data interpretation. In addition toenhanced interpretation and visualization capabilities, ASDMV will provide high-level interfaces for rule management, and will support information interchange standards with external information environments, such as the JBI. While specifically designedfor the Smart Sensor Web, the enhanced ASDMV prototype will comply with DII-COE specifications, and will provide an expandable architecture for a wide range of sensor-based information fusion and visualization applications.",

SASOVA will take advantage of a range of commercial-off-the-shelf(COTS) software tools and environments, and will be DII COE compliant.  Key Phase II objectives are: 1) generating detailed specifications for the prototype; 2) developing intelligent information processors for the key modules; 3) developing candidatevisualization prototypes; 4) conducting empirical evaluations of effectiveness and usability; 5) delivering and documenting the final prototype; and 6) identifying commercial product opportunities for Phase III development.",

Modern battlefield scenarios would greatly benefit if all ground vehicles could determine their position with high accuracy.

A system comprised of a GPS receiver augmented with low-cost sensors that individually yield only moderately accurate data when integrated together produces ahighly accurate result.  In our Phase I effort we developed a system that uses inexpensive accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and vehicle wheel sensors coupled with high fidelity models of the earth's gravity and magnetic fields.  Using low-cost,high performance digital signal processors (DSPs), sophisticated mathematical filters can produce high fidelity position and heading information.

This will be accomplished through the fabrication of a luminescent sensor material that, uponexposure to these agents, can be photo-activated to emit light. This activation can be initiated by a user located at a safe distance from hazardous substances and allow the evaluation of the hazard without risk. The luminescent sensor material will beprepared in a form that will allow its ready distribution and application over large areas.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In complex man-machine systems, increasing performance of computing and sensor technology often places proportionate new demands on system operators.  For example, in Naval sonar systems, tremendous increases in sensor and signal processing capacity haveimposed increasingly difficult demands on sonar operators conducting search.  Consequently, overall system effectiveness is reduced and varies widely with operator level of expertise.  The objective of this research project is to continue development ofnew means for improving overall sonar system effectiveness through activity-based automation.  In Phase I, feasibility of a novel operator Performance Support System (PSS) for managing operator passive search tasks was demonstrated.  This PSS incorporatesan embedded cognitive agent, based on knowledge elicited from expert sonar operators, that assists the sonar operator in managing their search effort in response to tactical, environmental, and system context.  Phase II will continue advanced developmentof this PSS as well as extend its application to other tasks such as active search.  This effort will include refining  and extending cognitive models of expert sonar operators, as well as design and implementation of appropriate controls and displays.Resulting prototypes will be tested and evaluated as part of the sonar Advanced Processing Build (APB) program peer review process.If successful, such technology can be transitioned into laboratory and at-sea testing leading eventually to certification and deployment in the AN/BQQ-10 sonar system.  Such technology could also find application in other Naval and military sensor systemssuch as Electronic Surveillance, as well as commercial systems where human operators are required to continually monitor and/or search large data streams, such as in process control and security systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The overall CODA objective in Phase II is to produce a mature, useful, and marketable set of cognitive decision agents for use within the Multi-Role Armament System (MRAS) Fires reference architecture.  CODA will be modular, and expandable to otherapplications, such as Objective Force Warrior.  CODA provides intelligent players for use within complex combat command and control systems.  These agents will be multi-purpose, and will be used for Course of Action (COA) wargaming and analysis, templatingof enemy unit actions during actual battle execution, and prediction of likely enemy targets.  The CODA agents are comprised of expertise models, developed using CHI Systems' iGEN cognitive agent toolset, and a software shell for communication andinteraction with the simulation environment and combat crew consoles. Cognitive agents offer a significant advantage over current rule-based aids, such as the C++ COA aid developed for the Future Fires Decision Support System (F2DSS).  IGEN-based agents,such as CODA, can assume complex roles, react believably to new and modified scenarios without changes, handle very complex environments in real time, and provide an explanation of recommendations that is understandable to the crew.   In a reduced manpowerenvironment, they provide an excellent means of crew aiding and wargaming support.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This proposal addresses the recent EPA ruling, published in the Federal Register (January 22, 2001), to lower the As levels in drinking waters from the current Maximum Contaminants levels (MCL) of 50 ppb to 10 ppb. Furthermore, it has reported that 2,300 groundwater systems in small communities ranging from 25 to 500 (which make up 67% of the groundwater systems) will be out of compliance; whereas, only 86 surface water systems will be out of compliance. EPA has given five years for the Public Water Systems (PWS) to be in compliance with the new regulations. Therefore in Phase II, our major thrust is to utilize a product, developed in Phase I, to remove As from the groundwater systems. Our product will capture, both the As(III) and As(V) species, and reduce their levels to <10 ppb. The household filter market appears to be lucrative as several households and businesses may act faster than PWS to meet the new regulatory limits. The success of Phase II study will ensure our product usage in groundwater systems and household filters. The total market to the PWS to meet the new As MCL is estimated to be about $200 million per year. Our strategy is to capture 10% of the groundwater systems market in the first two years and 50% of the market in five years. We believe this achievable because there is no competing product in the market.",

The Wireless Sensor addition allows for atotally cable free installation of a modern wireless style sensor and telemetry system featuring greatly improved levels of reliability, spectral efficiency, and cost effectiveness.  The system can gather a variety of information, such as acceleration,temperature, pressure, and vibration from anywhere on the aircraft or store under test, without modification of standard aircraft; telemeter it to the ground at ranges up to 50 miles; store large volumes of data on generic PC platforms in IRIG-106 form;maintain previously unachieved levels of reliability, thus saving expensive repeated test missions; avoid suffering from and causing interference to standard upper S band systems; and do so for a small fraction of the cost of currently fielded systems.The reason these large advances are possible is a somewhat obsolete standard in typical telemetry systems that may be hugely improved by use of state-of-the-art wireless techniques and Cleveland Medical Devices' proprietary MicroSynth (TM) technology.",

One course was created and evaluated in      Phase I of this project. That course improved knowledge and self-efficacy in a       group of 23 residents and resulted in high satisfaction. The course was              qualified for 1.5 hours of American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) CE           credit. Phase II will create six additional courses based on research findings,      guidelines, consultant input, literature review, and expert panel                    recommendations. A standard rapid-prototyping formative analysis technique will      utilize input from physicians and expert consultants to produce successively         improved versions of each course as input is received. The final courses will        be presented to the Center for Continuing Education at the University of             Pittsburgh, the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and the AAFP for CE       credit. In Phase II we will evaluate the suite of courses for their effect on:       knowledge, clinical skills, self-efficacy and reported behavior using a two          group, pre-post testing design. We will also assess overall user satisfaction        with the online learning experience in terms of course elements, comparison to       other learning experiences, and perceived impact. If the courses are                 successful, this project will produce a new means to educate physicians in           opiate addiction diagnosis and treatment techniques. The methodology used in         this research will serve as a template to guide other Investigators interested       in developing substance abuse continuing education materials.

Advantages ofthis system include that both the laser and OPO operate well at room-temperature with only passive cooling, the system is amendable to power scaling, and rapid wavelength tuning is possible.  OPO slope efficiencies of over 50% were demonstrated.Additionally, the system can produce a variety of waveforms with fine control over both temporal and spectral output characteristics.

The ongoing Phase I program is conducting system performance trades to establish sensitivity and spatial and temporal resolution capability forvarious system configurations.  A novel receiver architecture has been identified to both improve system sensitivity and reduce system complexity.  The proposed Phase II program will develop a detailed design, supported through carefully-designed riskreduction measurements, based on the Phase I preliminary design.  An existing (Army Research Office owned) transceiver and signal processor will then be modified to incorporate the MWIR transmit/receive architecture.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The proliferation of biological weapons among rogue nations and terrorist organizations necessitates that the U.S. develop the means of detecting deployment of these weapons in battlefield, base and civilian settings.  Portable and affordable remotesensors that give U.S. forces several minutes warning of approaching threats are necessary so that troops have adequate time to take appropriate protective measures.  Compact, eyesafe coherent Doppler lidars have been demonstrated as able to providesearch/detect/track functions for biological defense.  Importantly, these sensors are significantly smaller and lighter than competing active sensor technologies due to the much greater sensitivity of heterodyne, relative to direct, detection lidars.Additionally, these lidars provide volumetric, range-resolved, wind field measurements to ranges exceeding 20 km.  Ancillary benefits include providing input to plume dispersion models to provide accurate forecasting of plume tracks and integrated exposuremapping.  This can result in reduced contamination of mobile assets, minimization of personnel exposure, optimization of decontamination resources and minimization of the time needed to restore operations.  In this effort, CTI proposes integrating (1) aDoppler lidar for aerosol search/detect/and track functions and wind velocity measurements with (2) a plume dispersion and hazard assessment model to provide a capability for downwind hazard prediction and (3) a multi-pronged BW agent discriminationtechnique.  Applications include tactical surveillance for chem/bio defense, battlefield smoke and cloud transport and structure model development and validation, fence-line monitoring of industrial facilities, turbulence statistics and turbulent transportmodeling for meteorological research, and airport terminal area weather surveillance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         It is critical to extract maximum information from IR images for target detection, identification and classification systems.  The physical information in an image is contained in basically four parameters namely the intensity, phase, polarization andwavelength of the received light.  Besides acquiring intensity variations, rapid collection of corresponding polarization signatures at desired wavelengths would enhance the information content of an IR-scene.  In this regard, Coherent Technologies, Inc.(CTI) proposed an active device that simultaneously measures the spectral intensity and polarization content of an image in real time over the MWIR and LWIR spectral regions.  The device will generate four images that correspond to each of the Stokesvector components.  From Stokes components, degree and type of polarization of a scene can be ascertained.  In Phase I, design specifications of all critical components of an all-solid-state, compact, spectra-polarimeter that included a broadly tunableoptical parametric oscillator, an acousto-optic tunable filter, a",

        "abstract": "Abstract         3-D imaging ladar offers new capabilities to military/commercial markets.  However, imaging transceivers often utilize push-broom/whiskbroom image acquisition with costly, complex mechanical scanners and potential image distortion due to target/sensormotion.  Architectures with single-shot 3-D imaging focal plane arrays (FPAs) address these challenges but require higher pulse energy lasers to keep the laser irradiance per pixel constant.  To this end, CTI proposes an innovative high pulse energy laserthat maintains average power, minimizes cost and size impacts, and is optimized for low repetition-rates ~10-30Hz.  Phase I demonstrated key aspects of this robust, highly manufacturable eye-safe wavelength design: (1) a nonlinear optical pulse compressorproducing 1-2ns pulses for enhanced range resolution and speckle diversity, and (2) the path to an efficient, exceptionally compact configuration.  Longer pulse systems can provide few-cm range-precision with wide dynamic range receivers and adequate SNR.However, both may be problematic with emerging ladar FPA technology and range-resolution is intrinsically difficult to extract from longer pulses.  As such, the proposed short pulse laser maximally exploits near/longer-term ladar FPAs.  The laser canutilize laser diode pumping for sustained operation, or low-cost flash-lamps for limited rep-rate/shot operation.  Phase II delivers a brass-board transmitter for transceiver testing.  CTI's experience in flight-qualified ladar systems provides leverageand a timely path to market.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Modern conflict areas are a complex mix of urban and natural clutter, adverse weather and a high density of friendly forces, foes, and non-combatants.  Owing to the increasing complexity of conflict areas, long standoff detection, non-cooperativeidentification (NCTID), and targeting of both air and ground targets has increased in importance.  At the same time, surveillance (UAVs) and strike platforms have become smaller while missions have increased.  Multi-function systems can address the diverseneeds of reduced size/weight/power and increased functionality.  CTI proposes the continuation of a Phase I effort in combined FLIR-Coherent Laser Radar Cell Design to produce the first midwave infrared focalplanes with combined functionality of direct andcoherent detection.  Midwave infrared (MWIR) sensor capability is of particular interest for weather & obscurant penetration, enabling our forces to detect critical signatures in the conflict area under all conditions. The shape and vibrometry informationprovided by a coherent laser radar (coupled to a MWIR FLIR) can provide the critical data for rapid NCTID.  Significant leverage with a multi-million dollar DARPA MTO 3D Imaging Device program has already been shown in Phase I, and is expected to continueduring Phase II.  With the implementation of the proposed technology, this sensor would provide the combined capabilities of high-resolution MWIR FLIR for passive infrared search & track (IRST), combined with active remote sensing of surface vibrations(ground & hard target).  With continued technology development, expansion of the functionality is possible to include standoff detection of effluents, chemical & biohazards, hard target identification/designation countermeasures, flight data gathering, andsensing of winds & aerosols.",

In addition, pilot situational awareness can be improved through visualization of hazards ahead. The proposed effort leverages several ongoing development and demonstration efforts of airborne Doppler lidar sensors, including those associated with NASAs Aviation Safety Program. The Phase I program will evaluate scanning and processing concepts appropriate for the measurement objectives. Simulation-based demonstrations of system concept capability will be developed in Phase I. The Phase II effort will focus on the development and demonstration of a detailed, high-fidelity aircraft simulation for evaluation of concept robustness and interaction with pilots. Companion scanning Doppler lidar flight testing, especially that in companion with the Aviation Safety Program, will be utilized in Phase II to validate the lidar subsystem performance.",

These demands are being driven by the costs associated with launching in spacecraft or costs associated with flying bulky payloads in aircraft. The payload weight factors into these costs. These demands must be met while maintaining or improving the performance of the optical system. It is proposed that a mirror constructed with metal coated carbon fiber reinforced cyanate ester facesheets and lightweight core can meet all of these requirements. The facesheets and core must be designed using very high modulus, thin facesheets, and a stable and uniform core structure. It will be demonstrated that a thin metallic coating on a composite face sheet and a lightweight core structure can be diamond turned to a figure of  wave @.6328 microns or better while weighing less than 7 kg/m2 and remain stable over a wide temperature range.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The objective of this SBIR is to demonstrate feasibility of correcting figure errors on composite mirror substrates by systematic deposition of a thin film polymer. This process is analogous to ion figuring but in reverse. In the proposed process, a polymeric film is added to the mirror surface where needed to correct figure errors. The film is created by flash evaporating an acrylic monomer through a nozzle and e-beam (or UV) polymerizing the monomer in-situ. The evaporation process occurs under vacuum conditions. Since the evaporation rates are typically orders of magnitude faster than ion figuring removal rates, with proper flow control, a significant cost and time savings could be realized. Since the monomer is cured by electron beam or UV light, the process can occur at room temperature, whereas ion figuring heats the mirror surface adversely affecting some mirror constructions.Successful execution of this project could provide enabling technology for mirror programs such as FIRST, where ion figuring rates might be too slow to be practical and where thick sacrificial resin coatings (necessary for ion figuring composite mirrors) could adversely effect cryogenic performance. This technology could offer advancements for mirror programs such as FIRST, NGST and LIDAR mirrors.",

A high rate of restenosis remains the major complication of PTA and                  intravascular stenting procedures. The overall goal of this research is to           design, develop and test in vivo a novel collagen-based endoprosthesis (CBE)         for reducing the rate of post-PTA restenosis.                                                                                                                             In the phase I investigation, we have designed and developed a CBE prototype         that can be reliably delivered by standard transluminal percutaneous                 intervention techniques. The CBE prototype had a superior patency rate compared      to an ePTFE vascular graft-based endoprosthesis prototype in a canine femoral        artery model. In the phase II, we will further improve the design of the CBE,        and evaluate the in vivo performance of the CBE in an atherosclerotic animal         model. Upon completion of the phase II research, we will continue the phase III      program and actively pursue clinical trials and commercialization of the CBE         device.                                                                                 PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: There were more than 150,000 percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) procedures performed to treat patients with peripheral atherosclerotic lesions in the U.S. in 1995 alone. The occurrence of late restenosis typically lead to reinterventions that result in a significant increase of the total costs of patient care. If the proposed endoprosthesis device functions well, a 5% reduction of the restenosis rate can be translated into a savings of more than $100 million dollars a year in the associated healthcare costs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         An internal aircraft weapons bay, when exposed to freestream flow, experiences an intense aeroacoustic environment and varied suppression concepts have been tested for attenuating flow-induced oscillations.  Recent tests with open-loop, high-frequencyexcitation have shown great promise in providing broadband attenuation and elimination of tones.  High frequency actuation apparently alters the dynamics of the turbulent energy cascade and accelerates the transfer of energy from low frequency, large scaleeddies to high frequency, small-scale eddies, where it finally gets dissipated as heat. The proposed program is focused on using a Hartmann-Sprenger resonance tube as a high frequency actuator for cavity acoustic attenuation.  Large Eddy Simulation (LES)will be complemented by Phase-averaged Schlieren and by Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements in miniature and sub-scale cavities. These diagnostics will provide insight into turbulence-acoustic interactions. Testing at varied scales will providevalidation of scaling laws for high frequency actuation physics. CFD simulations will provide guidance for the design of the high frequency actuator. These investigations will provide the foundation for designing a prototype High Frequency AcousticSuppression (HFAS) system for eventual flight-testing on a RAAF F-111. The HFAS prototype will be based on a modification of the full-scale Active Separation Control (ASC) flight demonstration model.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Reusable launch vehicles present a series of unique problems in the management of the national air space. While the nominal ascent phase of reusable launch vehicles (RLVs) closely resembles the launch phase of an expendable launch vehicle (ELV), this can change quickly. RLVs have the capability to terminate flight during the ascent phase and attempt to land at the launch site or other commercial spaceports or airports. Commercial spaceports are being designed and built in non-traditional locations. Many of these spaceports are land-locked forcing vehicles launched from these spaceports to fly over populated areas and through commercial airways to reach orbit. Tools are required to manage these new dynamic spaceways. Spaceways that are shared by both standard air transportation, RLVs, and expendable ELVs. These tools will encompass the mission planning phase and the real time operations phase. This proposal will concentrate on the design of an integrated toolset that provides RLV mission planning functions that directly support real time mission operations. These functions will include; 6 degree of freedom trajectory planning for RLV operations including 4-dimensional visualization, shared situational awareness of real time operations, intelligent air traffic and RLV interference prediction, and integrated weather data and real time weather visualization.",

However, at present, there are no commercial membranes able to withstand the aggressive conditions associated with important industrial chemicals, including hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen chloride, and ozone.    Prototype, chemically resistant perfluorinated membranes have been developed and demonstrated to function with hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen chloride gases.  Using these membranes, this project will demonstrate several useful separations that have been requested by industrial gas manufacturers.  In Phase I, novel membrane formulations were tested and verified with HCl and HF aggressive gases.  Chemical compatibility and high gas flux were measured.  Phase II will construct and test commercial membrane modules from the formulations demonstrated in Phase I.  The process will be scaled-up and the economic advantages of using these membrane separations for semi-conductor and hydrogen fluoride alkylation manufacturing will be demonstrated.

        "abstract": "Abstract         60395      Emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) from gasoline refueling facilities continue to be an energy, safety, and environmental issue.  In such applications, it is desired to vent the air in the system and keep the VOC behind.  This project will develop a reverse separation membrane (RSM) system that allows for rapid venting of air while retaining the gasoline in underground storage tanks (UST) at gasoline dispensing facilities, i.e. gas stations.  The reverse separation membrane is ideally suited to keep VOC behind at atmospheric pressure, making retention of VOCs easier.  Phase I field testing demonstrated membrane feasibility by lowering the HC emission level to less than 1% on the permeate side of the membrane.  Phase II will build and test a single-stage RSM system that can dramatically reduce the VOC emissions from USTs and thereby dramatically reduce the loss of gasoline.                   Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: In addition to the 182,000 gasoline-dispensing facilities (GDFs) with a savings of 180 million gallons of gasoline per year, several other potential VOC applications should value this technology, including chemical and pharmaceutical processes, tobacco reforming processes, fuel oil tank farm storage, and paint shop venting.",

Currently available insulation systems either will not meet these requirements, or will compromise the magnet system design or economics to such an extent as to make them unfeasible.  In this project, new hybrid organic polymer insulation systems will be developed, enabling more practical and economical magnet systems to be designed and built.  In Phase I, new hybrid organic systems with the promise of improved radiation resistance were demonstrated to provide suitable processing and performance characteristics meeting NSO requirements.  Systems suitable for vacuum-pressure impregnation, pre-impregnated tape, and high-pressure laminates were evaluated.  Radiation exposure results are expected early in Phase II.  In Phase II, the new hybrid systems will be further optimized and characterized, before and after exposure to radiation, and validated as suitable for NSO applications such as FIRE and NCSX.  Extensive testing will be performed to provide relevant engineering data, and practical manufacturing techniques will be developed through the construction and testing of magnet sub-assemblies.                     Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: New hybrid insulation resin systems should have commercial benefit in fusion, high energy physics, and commercial magnet applications.

We propose a phase II effort tocontinue the research and development of an integrated missileseeker signal-processor (IMSSP). Target acquisition and trackingare the essential tasks of seeker processing for autonomousguidance. The computational complexity of automatic targetrecognition (ATR) involved in the two tasks was the main technicalhurdle of this project. Through phase I effort, we developed apractical solution of the problem via a GPS/INS-guided-ATRalgorithm, and demonstrated the general feasibility of theintegrated missile seeker signal processor. The first objective ofphase II work is to develop a detailed specification for theintegrated signal processor with processing rates consistent withnext generation imagers, compatible with the power and packagingrequirements of the missile seeker, and with sensorexchangeability. Phase II objective also includes developingalgorithms, software, and hardware for seeker informationprocessing, and developing a demonstration of the system throughapplication simulation and evaluation.",

This project will develop an automated online vision inspection system to recognize the sex of baby chicks and separate them into different bins. Our Phase I research has positively demonstrated the feasibility of the technology. This research will be conducted with four aspects. First, we will develop an optical imaging system to inspect chick feather patterns. Second, we will develop chick wing presentation and handling mechanisms for online viewing and sorting of chicks. Next, we will develop electronic and mechanical interfaces for the synchronization and control of motion vision and separation operations. A working prototype will be developed in Phase II.",

These very promising Phase I               developed techniques will be expanded upon in Phase II. In order to culminate        in a fully developed, high performance accelerator, capable of operating at          80uA dual extraction, the project will also include research on ion sources and      self-shielding. The shielding research will involve the application of Monte         Carlo simulations to streamline the revisions of the shield composition and          geometry. The ion source development will involve improvement to heat and gas        transport in a differentially pumped internal Penning source. The combined           technologies will comprise an accelerator that is less than 10 percent more          costly to manufacture than our current offering, with twice the yield.

        "abstract": "Abstract         CompuTherm, LLC proposes to develop and experimentally validate thermodynamic databases for nickel, aluminum, and titanium based alloys. Thermodynamic databases are critically needed by the materials industry to accelerate the development of new materialsfor applications such as turbine engines. Databases greatly reduce the need for costly and time-consuming trial-and-error experiments. Unfortunately, existing databases do not meet the needs of industry due to insufficient chemical elements, improper modeltypes, and inconsistencies. In Phase I, CompuTherm LLC successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using our new USAF SBIR funded software, PANDAT, to quickly produce core databases for nickel, aluminum, and titanium-based alloys. In Phase II, we willdevelop the concepts from Phase I into commercially viable products for simulating real alloys: a 17-component nickel alloy database, a 15-component aluminum alloy database, and a 17-component titanium alloy database. Several companies-General ElectricCompany, Ford Motor Company, ALCOA, Howmet Castings, and Ladish Inc.-expressed great interest in these databases and agreed to provide $79,000 hard investment and $160,000 in-kind support for the proposed database development. The proposed databases,integrated with our PANDAT software, will provide critical data for time and money-saving simulations for processes such as solidification.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Not Available This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to provide the means to reliably calculate turbopump stiffness and damping matrices based on dynamic force measurements collected using a magnetic bearing rig. During Phase I exploratory development of a high suction specific speed (NSS) = 65,000 rocket engine turbopump pump stage was carried out and laid the foundation for this project. A complementary Phase I project for NASA focused on an NSS = 85,000 stage. Earlier Air Force funding concentrated on demonstrating magnetic bearings as a useful lab instrument. More recent breakthroughs include a novel fix for auto-oscillation and establishing the structure of an innovative dynamic force matrix measurement methodology. The primary challenge in this work is to isolate those forces on the rotor (with and without cavitation) due to the interaction of the impeller with the stator using innovative test and signal processing techniques. By testing a series of impellers, a database of rotordynamic coefficients will be established based on component dynamic force data. An additional objective is to evaluate the capability of CFD for replicating those physical force measurements. The goal is to create scientifically based design methods for lighter high-performance turbopumps.  Smaller, lighter, and higher speed rocket engine turbopumps are required to meet lower space launch cost requirements. Successful accomplishment of this fundamentally based approach for measuring component specific rotor dynamic forces and a method for using experimental results on a broader basis in the design process can lead to a breakthrough technology. It will enable turbopump designers to overcome current thresholds due to hydraulic induced rotor dynamic instabilities. In addition to reducing equipment size and cost, reliability will improve. The technology is also applicable to industrial turbomachinery including industrial pumps, aircraft engine fuel pumps, and compressors.",

Phase II continues to refine the properties and techniques for producing this new class of High Performance Non-corroding Steel-Reinforced Concrete. Improved corrosion resistance of steel reinforcement in concrete structures could address a major infrastructure problem that has been estimated to require up to $3 trillion for repair. The potentially cost effective coatings to be developed and commercially applied during production runs in steel mills would result in a value added product of major importance for managing the infrastructure.

This      dependable applicator and condom system (KwikezeTM) will offset universal            reluctance toward condom usage and mitigate associated health risks. Specific        Objectives Phase II: A) Finalize production scale quantities from existing           optimized prototype. B) Test production scale applicators/condoms at                 independent labs following FDA requirements (ASTM D3492-99). C) Conduct              experiments/clinical trials (incorporating Phase I findings) at three separate       sites coordinated through Center for Contraceptive Research at University of         Alabama Medical School. D) Three experiments total 240 couples: 1) 96 married        heterosexual, 2) 96 unmarried heterosexual and 3) 48 male homosexual couples.        Research Design: 10 trial alternating treatment repeated measures with random        assignments to determine applicator effectiveness plus deriving from gender,         age (3) and race (4). E) Rates of condom slippage/breakage will be                   determined/norms generated for independent variable subgroups. Benefits: 1)          Expected to maintain condom integrity including minimizing slippage and              breakage. 2) KwikezeTM will increase condom usage thus minimizing disease            transmission and unwanted pregnancies. (Research results should allow for the        commercialization of a cost effective and safe KwikezeTM with greater appeal to      populations choosing to practice safe sex and/or birth control.)

Current treatment regimens are strict and overwhelming but very effective      in controlling the severity and morbidity of the disease. However, long-term         use has begun to uncover significant side effects. A new class of drugs called       HIV entry inhibitors has been envisioned that will be a significant addition to      the arsenal. Blocking of the CCR5 or CXCR4 coreceptors will prevent the entry        of the virus into the macrophages or T cells, respectively. Library screening        and peptide analoging will continue, making use of our expressed, solubilized,       immobilized receptors and affinity purified ligands from these libraries, to         increase potency and specificity and develop a lead compound to inhibit HIV          infection. Full characterization of the inhibitors will be performed to              determine the mechanism of action and the efficacy of the compound. Toxicity         and pharmacokinetic studies will be performed on the lead compound after             scale-up and formulation to enable an IND filing. Although initial preclinical       and clinical studies will be performed with a subcutaneous injectable                formulation, the goal of this research is to develop a controlled-release            injectable depot formulation of a CCR5 inhibitor.

        "abstract": "Abstract         A major concern for coal-fired power plants throughout the nation is disposal of bottom ash. This by- product of coal combustion is produced in large quantities and disposal is costly. Presently bottom ash is disposed of in landfills throughout the nation. Landfilling is not an efficient and environmentally feasible method of disposal. Phase I - Laboratory research utilizing bottom ash as a fine aggregate in asphaltic concrete has previously been conducted indicating excellent long-term stability, durability and constructability of asphaltic concrete using locally produced bottom ash. All Phase I goals and objectives were met. The proposed program is directed at demonstrating the feasibility of using bottom ash as a fine aggregate in an asphaltic concrete pavement under actual environmental and traffic loading conditions. The projected location of the pavement is an urban street supplied by a local municipality. Utilization of bottom ash as fine aggregate is particularly important in northeastern Wyoming where suitable aggregates for all types of pavements must be transported a minimum of 80 miles for quarries. The transport of this material is costly which limits pavement maintenance and new road construction for rural isolated communities. Bottom ash is produced locally providing a much needed aggregate source.",

In Phase I, a process for manufacturing HgI2 photodetectors was developed.  The detectors had a Full Width Half Max (FWHM) resolution between 5.6% and 6.6%, with an average of 6.2% FWHM for 9 out of 10 operational units produced.  Phase II will fine tune performance and commercialize the process with formalized process control and quality assurance monitoring.  100 HgI2 detectors will be manufactured in 14 process change steps, where each step in the process addresses optimization of functional and appearance design considerations.  All units will enter a longevity study, which will provide data for process control and quality assurance for detectors yielding FWHM resolution of 5.5%, or better.                 Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The technology should replace bulky and less efficient photomultiplier tupes used for intermediate energy room temperature nuclear spectroscopy. HgI2 replacement units would not be susceptible to magnetic fields and would be ruggedized for nuclear assay field uses.  There is also a potential for medical applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This SBIR Phase II project will confirm the drift reduction potential of the wingtip-mounted device developed in Phase I, through fabrication, installation on an agricultural aircraft, and field testing of the optimized design. Off-target drift of pesticides and herbicides during aerial spray applications remains a major source of environmental concern, due to its potential human health impacts, downwind contamination and damage to crops and livestock, and endangerment of ecological resources. New design tools, including the computer model AgDRIFT? (developed by Continuum Dynamics, Inc., and funded through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement between EPA's Office of Research and Development and the Spray Drift Task Force, an organization of 39 chemical companies manufacturing pesticides and herbicides in the United States), provide the enabling technology with which to complete the development of the optimized wingtip-mounted device in mitigating drift from aerial application. The preliminary device, developed and analyzed in Phase I with these validated tools, has been shown to reduce drift fraction over the edge of the spray block by 60 percent or more. A preliminary stability and control analysis indicates that the net effect on aircraft dynamic response and static stability will be minimal. The Phase II effort will verify the drift reduction of the device found by the numerical models, through fabrication and installation of the optimized design on a selected agricultural aircraft, and execution of an extension field study. Phase II results will demonstrate that the device can significantly reduce the buffer zones currently being considered around sensitive areas (by up to a factor of three or more), expand the usefulness of available pesticide and herbicide products, lower application costs, reduce environmental risk, and permit the delivery of these materials in a more accurate and environmentally safe manner. Smaller buffer zones provide an incentive for the pilot to spray more of the field, thereby improving productivity and protecting more crop. They also open the chemical market, permitting the pilot to use products in situations where these chemicals cannot now be used. Reducing drift also will have a positive impact on aviation insurance and, most importantly, the environment.",

Ultrasonic atomization produces         low velocity, monodispersed droplets, which provide excellent lung deposition.       The proposed device can deliver drugs for respiratory disease treatment, as          well as systemic application that take advantage of the lung's ability to            transfer molecules to the blood stream. Electronic control provides precise          dose control meet or exceed FDA regulations. Moreover, the ultrasonic-based          system does not require a propellant, which will help manufacturers eliminate        chlorofluorocarbon-based system and will simplify formulation of their               products. The feasibility of the system was demonstrated in Phase I by building      and testing a benchtop unit. The Phase II aims are to optimize the Phase I unit      by reducing its size and weight while increasing its efficiency. The optimized       prototype's performance will determined with solution and suspension                 formulations in preparation for Phase III clinical trials. Measurements of drop      size distributions, drug delivery dose-to-dose repeatability, and atomization        rate as function of system parameters will be used to measure performance.

Development of new contraceptive options is necessary to         provide accessible birth control to all individuals regardless of sociological,      financial, or educational limitations. Current literature implicates marketed        spermicidal formulations in cervical and vaginal irritation leading to lesions       and acquisition of sexually transmitted diseases. Reassessment of these              spermicides by the FDA may result in increased costs or their removal from the       market. New, inexpensive spermicides with improved safety and effectiveness          must be developed. The long-term goal of this research proposal is the               development of a marketable topical intra-vaginal contraceptive product based        on an anti-sperm monoclonal antibody, S19. This mAb inhibits human sperm             function and gamete interactions in vitro. During Phase I of the project, a          recombinant single chain fragment variable region (scFv) miniantibody derived        from S19 was engineered and shown to have the same anti-sperm reactivity as the      native mAb. This scFv is termed RASA, for Recombinant Anti-Sperm Antibody. In        the proposed Phase II study, we will first humanize RASA, and re-assess the          immunoactivity of the new scFv. Second, we will develop an efficient,                cost-effective platform for production and purification of large amounts of          RASA in a bacterial or yeast expression system. Third, we will formulate the         immunoactive humanized recombinant scFv with candidate intra-vaginal delivery        vehicles including Novasomes, a trilamellar liposome-based vehicle, and test         the activity of these RASA preparations to determine optimal formulation             conditions and dosing. Finally, the stability and safety of the optimized            formulation will be assessed.

However the use of these         drugs in a chronic setting may be limited due to unwanted side-effects on            bleeding. The focus of this Phase II application is to develop novel                 therapeutic regulators of alphaIIbbeta3 function, by modulating the integrin         cytoplasmic domains themselves. Phase I studies identified a strategy for            regulating integrin signaling by inhibiting tyrosine phosphorylation of the          cytoplasmic domain of beta3. We postulate that compounds capable of inhibiting       this cytodomain activity will disrupt alphaIIbbeta3 function thus having the         potential to be a new class of anti-thrombotics. In the long term we will            develop these novel inhibitors of alphaIIbbeta3 to offer improved therapy for        the large population afflicted with ischemic cardiovascular diseases.

        "abstract": "Abstract         This proposal discusses the development Real-time PCR assays using novel prostate cancer markers for the diagnosis/prognosis of prostate cancer.  Prostate cancer is a leading cause of deaths among men in the U.S.  Good prognosis depends on the early detection of the disease.  However, the sensitivity and the specificity of the current available diagnostic markers is insufficient.  Using state of the art technology, differential display PCR and cDNA, PCR and electronic subtraction methods, we have identified 8 prostate cancer markers and established their tissue specificity and relationship to tumor stage using Real-time PCR.  Five of these novel genes will be evaluated to determine the optimal combination for use in Real-time PCR assays to detect micrometastases in blood using epithelial cell immunocapture methods.  Antibodies to proteins derived from the additional three genes will be used to develop a prostate specific immunocapture assay.  Real-time PCR with some of the genes using blood samples has already been achieved at Corixa and will be expanded and standardized assays developed.  This in combination with collaborations with key investigators in prostate cancer and access to an extensive blood and tissue bank should enable the goals and objectives of this proposal to be achieved. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The proposed studies will lead to commercialization of a high throughput RT-PCR assay for diagnosis and/or prognosis of prostate cancer.  Such tests would be marketed both in the U.S. and worldwide. The estimated world wide market for such a tests is $200-300 million/year.",

However,preliminary measurements indicate the presence of extremely highnoise levels inside the vehicle cabin.  This noise, potentiallyin excess of 120 dBA, will require multiple levels of individualhearing protection and make speech communication inside thevehicle nearly impossible.  In Phase I, CSA Engineering examinedseveral passive and active noise suppression approaches insimulations of the AAAV cabin and disturbance environment.  Twoapproaches, one passive and one active, have the most potentialfor reducing the cabin noise levels with the least weight andpower penalties.  In this Phase II effort, CSA proposes thedevelopment of these two approaches through detailed design,development hardware fabrication, and a development testingprogram to the point of prototype hardware delivery.  In anoption task, CSA will integrate this prototype hardware into avehicle and perform testing.  Successful demonstration of noisereduction will prepare the way for a fleet-wide noise suppressionsolution.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Payload planners of earth imaging systems have always struggled with the fundamental problem of designing a delicate, pointing system that survives the severe vibro-acoustic environments of launch.  The standard solution is to  mass load the spacecraft busand lock down the pointing stage during launch.  However, the parasitic mass and unwanted complexity are unacceptable for future RLV systems.  CSA Engineering therefore proposes a modular, tunable, dual-use suspension system that protects payloads duringlaunch and positions them on-orbit.  The proposed innovatin consists of a suite of modular, reusable active struts arranged in a hexapod configuration that mechanically isolated a payload from structureborne vehicle vibration while providing on-orbitstabilization and pointing. The proposed technology will be the only commercially available long stroke positioning system that combines long stroke isolation and precision pointing.  The electromagnetic system offers value for any complex, high-accuracypointing task where isolation in six degrees of freedom is required.  The research will develop an engineering demonstration strut, followed by a six degree-of-freedom isolation pointing system.  The system will have performance charatertics directlyrelevant to the X-37/X-40/SMV.  The developmental effort will produce a product directed towards the X-37/X-40/SMV.  CSA will work with Boeing to insure relevance, and CSA will be positioned to deliver the product for early RLV flights.  A precisionstabilization derivative product for Internatinal Space Station platforms pallets will be also offered.  Component technology will be inserted into commercial communications satellites via established channels.  Finally, in the space market, the technologywill be highly appropriate for reconnaissance systems.  Airborne platforms such as the Airborne Laser will make use of the combined isolation and pointing.  The precision motion control technology will contribute directly to CSA's expanded emphasis on thisarea for precision manufacturing.  In combination with a larger corporate partner, CSA will offer new long stroke, high resolution positioning stages for manufacturing.",

The research will produce key technologies that will enable realization of the PowerSail concept.

PowerSail structural elements will be tested, using new methods as necessary, including a single bay, membrane, multiple-bay structures and a robot arm.

In Phase 1, the efforts required toestablish the feasibility of previously undeveloped key portions of thisoverall framework are proposed. These efforts include: 1) the developmentof new membrane material energy dissipation property test methods, 2)demonstrating structural energy dissipation mechanisms for use on M/Istructures as needed, and 3) developing the analytical methodology requiredto accurately predict the response of M/I structures to realisticdisturbance loads. The motivation for this work comes from several areas.First, M/I structures, being optimized for minimal weight through thereduction of load bearing material structures, are highly stressed. Thusany additional dynamic stresses can lead to eventual fatigue failures.Secondly, unknown structural dynamics can lead to control structureinteraction and the possible loss of the spacecraft. Finally, structuraldynamics with long settling times can cause degradation in missionperformance.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Shock is a major problem for spacecraft, and is the largest dynamic load on spacecraft during launch on large launch vehicles.  Shock to spacecraft during launch comes from two sources, the launch vehicle (fairing separation being one of the largest shocksources) and the spacecraft separation event.  A whole-spacecraft shock isolation system will prevent shock produced by the launch vehicle from reaching the spacecraft, and a low-shock release device in the separation system will reduce the shock due tothe separation event. The overall technical objective of this SBIR is to demonstrate in tested hardware that spacecraft separation systems can be built that both successfully separate the spacecraft from the launch vehicle and protect the spacecraft fromall shock events during launch.  The resulting system will be lighter weight, less complex, and less costly than a non-integrated approach.  The new device, referred to as the SoftRide Separation System for Spacecraft (SRS3), will be designed fordistributed mounted spacecraft utilizing a band-clamp class of interface.  Three devices including two 15-inch and one 38-inch will be developed, shock tested, and delivered. The end result in Phase II will be proven technology than can be scaled toaccommodate any payload on any launch vehicle.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Emergence of antibiotic-resistance has          created a medical crisis. Life-threatening bacterial pathogens, such as              Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis, have developed widespread           resistance to current antibiotics. Infectious disease has become the third           leading cause of death in the U.S. At Cubist, novel bacterial targets have been      identified to produce new classes of antibiotics to address the increasing           mortality caused by infectious disease. SecA is one of such targets that has         been chosen for screening of drug leads. SecA is a unique key component              involved in bacterial protein translocation and is essential for cell growth.        Significant progress has been made during the Phase I grant period to develop        SecA as an antimicrobial target. In this Phase II application we plan to             identify and optimize small molecule compounds that will be suitable for             pre-clinical studies.

The concept of the traveling charge is to accelerate some portion of the total propellingcharge down bore with the projectile.

This Phase II effort involvesdevelopment and demonstration of the functional aspects of the stick propellant encapsulated within a VHBR energetic inhibitor matrix under the gun launch environment.  Activities to be undertaken include development of a suitable inhibitor compositionexhibiting very high stable burn rates at gun operating pressures and the required structural characteristics, details associated with manufacture of the VHBR inhibitor as well as processes for incorporation of this material with the stick propellant, anda series of subscale gun tests to evaluate performance of the traveling charge.  Additionally, a series of characterization tests will be conducted to establish combustion behavior and sensitivity of the VHBR energetic inhibitor and traveling chargecanister assemblies.",

The results of this effort will be applied for information visualization tosatisfy the need for information analysts and decision makers.  To extract concept-based, general events from free text requires the application of `cutting edge' Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology.  The approach Cymfony proposes consists of ablend of machine learning techniques, hand-coded FST (finite state transducer) rules, and hard-coded procedures.  By taking this flexible approach in combining different techniques and methods, it will be possible to exploit the best of different paradigmsdepending on the specific task being handled.  The final deliverable includes (i) an IE system for intermediate-level extraction of concept based events, and (ii) an event visualization prototype to demonstrate the application of the new IE technology forinformation analysts.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project describes a novel laser-based technology for large-scale analysis and processing of living cells. One application of this technology is the detection and elimination of contaminating tumor cells from autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplants for cancer patients. Published studies have shown that: (1) contaminating tumor cells contribute to cancer relapse; (2) successful tumor purging provides a clinical benefit; and (3) current purging methods are inadequate. Therefore, technology that reliably eliminates tumor cells from transplants, while leaving HSCs undamaged, is needed. A patented innovative approach integrating fluorescence scanning cytometry, real-time image analysis, and specific laser-induced killing of individual cell targets will be used. The Phase II project will complete the clinical-scale prototype instrument, leading into clinical trials. The instrument design will then be configured for successful commercial manufacturing, and further improvements in capabilities will be pursued in order to maintain market leadership and expand into other markets. The studies conducted in the Phase II project will lead to commercialization of a method to eliminate detectable tumor cells from an HSC transplant with a several hour automated procedure. The resulting instrumentation will also be useful in a number of other clinical and research applications that require cell analysis and purification with high purity, yield and speed.    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (applicant's abstract): Autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)         transplantation is used for treatment of many cancers. However, contaminating        tumor cells within HSC harvests are problematic since their contribution to          disease relapse has been unambigiously established through gene-marking              studies. Therefore, technology that reliably eliminates detectable tumor cells,      while leaving HSCs undamaged, is needed. Several purging methods have been           developed, but they are known to be inadequate. An innovative approach               integrating fluorescence scanning cytometry, real-time image analysis, and           laser-induced necrosis is described here. Phase I studies with antibody-labeled      tumor cell lines demonstrated sensitive fluorescent detection, and subsequent        specific killing with a short laser pulse. Phase II studies are proposed to          complete development of the clinical-scale PhotosisTM instrument and further         develop the antibodies and disposables required for clinical trials. This            approach of scanning an entire transplant, thereby locating and killing every        detectable tumor cell, provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the efficacy        of purging in a setting where information on total tumor burden within the           transplant is generated, down to the level of one detectable cell within the         transplant. Although this proposal describes a tumor purging application, there      are numerous other research and clinical applications that will be enabled once      the instrument is completed.                                                         PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  These studies will lead to commercialization of a method to eliminate detectable tumor  cells from an HSC transplant within a several hour automated procedure. In 1997, over  45,000 HSC transplants were performed worldwide, and the number is increasing 20-25%  per year.  The resulting instrumentation could ultimately be applicable to any process that  requires a highly defined cell product.",

This courseware will also feature a statistics text (Statistics: Making Sense of Data by Stout, Marden and Travers), self-assessment tools, a \"Virtual Professor\" help system, a \"Virtual Statistics Consulting Lab,\" and entry-level spreadsheet-based statistical software. The target market is students in introductory statistics courses, who will purchase the product just as they now purchase texts. The courseware aims to leverage the latest and most standard web technologies that are anticipated to be in place at the conclusion of the project's development phase. The plan combines the power of a web-based structure with the new resampling techniques to create a unique learning environment for statistics students. The Urn Sampler will be an open and flexible lab tool that will let teachers create exercises to supplement class lectures and other course materials. It will make it easy to teach the new compute-intensive resampling methods that have proven successful in teaching statistical inference. It addresses a diverse audience, including undergraduate and graduate students taking a required course in quantitative reasoning or statistics, students taking an undergraduate major or minor in statistics, and graduate students studying statistics and continuing education students. Additional product sales will come through purchases of parts of the web product by students whose instructors have adopted a text other than the Stout, et al. text.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION: It is now standard practice to incorporate formal sequential            monitoring procedures into the design and conduct of long term randomized            clinical trials. Interim monitoring provides an advance determination of             efficacy and safety so that a data and safety monitoring board can decide            whether to terminate the study early. However the integrity of a study can be        seriously compromised if the accruing data are monitored inappropriately. One        then runs the risk of attributing chance fluctuations in the data to a real          therapeutic effect. Hence one needs specialized statistical methods and              accompanying software that can balance the ethical and economic advantages of        stopping a study early against the risk of an incorrect conclusion. Research         has progressed rapidly in this area over the past two decades and methods have       been developed to meet the key practical needs. These methods are not yet            accessible to clinical trials practitioners because there exists no friendly,        professionally developed and validated software implementing them on a popular       platform such as Microsoft Windows. This Phase II SBIR proposal is intended to       fill this void. The goal is to complete the development of WinEaSt, a Windows        package for the design and interim monitoring of group sequential clinical           trials. When completed, WinEaSt will: (1) Perform group-sequential inference         for the parameters of interest from practically any type of mathematical model       including generalized linear models, parametric and semi-parametric survival         models and mixed models for longitudinal studies. (2) Permit adaptive                re-estimation of sample size, accrual period, total study duration and other         design parameters, at each interim monitoring time-point using                       information-based monitoring.

Understanding how gravel is transported through measurements is essential for monitoring the ecological and physical processes of gravel-bed systems and for calibrating sediment transport models. We propose Phase II research to develop: 1) impact-recording sensors that can be deployed by wading operators or from bridges (designated Type 1 devices)and autonomous, internally recording systems that can be deployed in streams, on beaches, or on talus slopes for weeks to months to capture continuous records of bedload transport (designated Type 2 devices), 2) a method to estimate mass and volume transport rates in gravel bedload from the particle momentum data recorded by acoustic instruments and water depth logged by an auxiliary pressure sensor, and 3) an embedded controller to compute and record momentum, mass and volume-fluxes and pressure in real-time. Successful completion of the project will result in two new field-tested and flume-calibrated instruments that are safer to operate, more efficient in terms of data recovered per operator-hour and sampling intensity, and are functional over a wider range of transport and flow conditions than can be sampled with existing methods.",

The scattering signal ismonitored from all particles, and black carbon particles absorbsufficient energy to incandesce, and this incandescence ismeasured by broadband and narrowband detectors.  Particles otherthan black carbon will not incandesce, and they are identified bytheir scattering signal. The mass of the black carbon particlesis directly related to the intensity of the incandescencesignal.  From the ratio of the scattering to the incandescencesignals, it appears possible to obtain information on the shapeof the particles.

This system will measure cloud particle size, number concentration, mass and phase, as well as temperature pressure and airspeed. This combination of measurements allows the system to operate in a stand-alone mode for situations where the instruments could be used on commercial aircraft for gathering data on icing conditons or for icing certification activities. The range of particle sizes and supercooled water content are broader than currently required by FAA icing certification regulations (FAR-25) and provide excellent resolution at the larger drop sizes that are presently being studied as particularly hazardous for flight operations. The built-in redundancy also improves data quality and operational reliability.The culmination of Phase I activities will be a prototype instrument consisting of an integration of five sensors into a single, streamlined package that minimizes drag and mounts easily to an aircraft fuselage or wing. This proof-of-concept development will use laboratory testing to show that particles in the proposed size range can be accurately measured and that the integrated system fits in a package that is aerodynamically stable without disturbing the particle measurements.",

However, the majority of collaborative tools today are application specific and require collaborators to develop new or additional skills with computing proficiency.    This project will develop an alternative approach that will propel collaboration forward by employing a collaboration engine that allows for the mirroring of key files across a group of users.  This application-independent service would allow all existing single or multi-user applications to be used in a more collaborative manner across existing infrastructures.  In Phase I, a mirroring prototype was developed to demonstrate the feasibility of real time mirroring as a service, and its application independence was verified.  Additionally, the requirements for a kernel set of mirroring components needed to provide for thick or thin features to a client system were examined, while addressing contention, security, and scalability issues.  Phase II will research the intelligence elements necessary for a client agent and server agent and develop client and server software components that provide for a powerful and robust mirroring capability.  Additionally, contention, security, and scalability features will be built into the kernel components.                  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The collaborative engine, built on mirroring and agents, should work across heterogeneous platforms and enable the conversion of existing single-user or multi-user applications into collaborative tools without requiring any changes to the client operating environments, the servers, or other existing infrastructure.",

The Phase I results show the extract to be very effective in preventing corrosion of steel and aluminum either individually or when coupled with dissimilar metals. Under many conditions, the tobacco extract performs as good as or better than chromates, which have been the corrosion inhibition standard, but which are under attack for health, safety and environmental reasons. The extract is effective when added to recirculating water systems, road salt, paints and metal-finishing acids. In Phase II, we will optimize the extraction process, verify corrosion inhibition under a variety of extraction and use conditions, develop quality assurance/quality control procedures, and address long- term stability issues. Commercialization opportunities and strategies will continue to be developed. The extract has three significant potential advantages over currently used inorganic inhibitors: 1) they are environmentally benign with minimal health and safety concerns; 2) they originate from a renewable biosource; and 3) they will be cost-effective.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will lead to a breakthrough in the use of laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) for chromatographic detection. Commercial standalone LIF detectors are based on CW lasers and collect data at a fixed wavelength. Consequently, they add minimal capability for resolving complex mixtures beyond that inherent in the chromatographic separation itself. On-the-fly fluorescence lifetime measurements at a single emission wavelength have been proposed as a better way to resolve the signals of co-eluting species. Our approach is far more powerful because it provides lifetimes on-the-fly and at several wavelengths simultaneously. A new prism flow cell fiber optically coupled to the emission spectrograph was introduced in Phase I. In addition, two different algorithms strategies for analyzing the multi-dimensional fluorescence data were developed and demonstrated. In Phase II a diode-pumped laser will replace the flashlamp pumped excitation laser, thereby providing 100 times higher pulse repetition frequency, 10 times shorter pulse duration, and 10 times better shot-to-shot stability. New digitizer technology will be incorporated to accommodate the laser's high repetition frequency. Important Phase II activities include fluorescence methods development to extend the range of applications to drugs and drug metabolites and elaboration of the chemometric algorithms. The instrumental approach to be realized through the Phase II research will have a profound impact on QA/QC assessments of drug purity, bioequivalence and pharmacokinetic studies, and research investigations in humans and animals. Sales of several hundred units per year to pharmaceutical manufacturers, contract research organizations, and universities are anticipated. The technology will later be adapted for faster and more accurate DNA sequencing",

To establish this goal, current commercially available finite element software wasutilized to develop a methodology for predicting the effects of Air Film Damping on dynamic response of simple components such as beams and plates as well as on a more complex component, namely the AADC GMA3007 fan blade.  Test articles were fabricatedaccording to the designs and experimental results were compared to the analysis with good correlation.  The outcome is a step-by-step procedure for design of Damping Technologies, Incorporated Air Film Damping Systems (DTI/AFDS).The objective of the Phase II program is to apply this methodology to design suitable optimized Air Film Damping Systems for a selected engine component, verify that the predicted performance is achieved, determine and enhance the durability of thesystems, and develop suitable manufacturing techniques for production purposes.",

The ISRTDA will evaluate the mine warfare situation using information from MIW Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) operations. It will also determinehow best to utilize available MIW Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) assets to improve the situational awareness of MIW planners and operators. ISRTDA will allow MIW planners and operators to (1) develop more effective ISR plans, (2) moreaccurately evaluate the effectiveness of ISR operations, and (3) more accurately evaluate the threat to shipping from mines that may be in a maritime littoral region of interest. Having these capabilities will significantly improve the ability of Naval MIWforces to carry out their missions through the more effective use of information obtained fro ISR systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Applicant's abstract): The power of polymerase chain reaction           (PCR) as an analytical tool has been widely tested. Recently, many clinical          diagnostic procedures used especially for screening several types of cancer, a       wide range of bacterial, viral and parasitic diseases, individual                    identification in paternity testing, forensic analysis, and tissue typing have       started employing PCR technology. Despite the invention of PCR 14 years ago,         most researchers and diagnostic labs conduct PCR analyses one step at a time,        with manual transfers and dedicated, single-function instruments at each step.       Furthermore, both extensive manual handling and the physical heat-transfer           constraints in the thermal cycling step, can contribute to 1/2 to two day long       PCR tests. Although there are some automated tools available to reduce the           manual work at each step, there are currently no cost effective instruments          that completely automate the PCR protocol in a flexible manner. This contrasts       with many of the completely automated non-PCR-based diagnostic instruments in        the modern clinical labs. We propose to apply several recent advances in small       sample handling, fast thermal cycling and general sample processing to the PCR       protocol in order to speed analysis and reduce costs and manual labor. A             technician would simply load a plate of DNA templates and a plate of the             required PCR primers, then start the instrument. The instrument would precisely      aspirate the required volume of each sample, then perform the thermal cycling,       post-PCR cleanup, detection and results-tracking steps in a completely               automated fashion, offering full automation. The instrument would reduce entire      test costs (reagents, disposables and labor) by a factor of 20 or more.              Considering the wide applications of PCR, we propose to make the instrument          flexible (e.g., different types of detection protocols with few changes to the       instrument hardware). The basis of the new instrument is to perform all              functions: mixing, thermal cycling, clean up, detection and sterilization            within the same set of nano-pipetter reaction vessels. In the Phase I, the           target is on two PCR-based protocols: one for DNA diagnostics and one for SNP        analysis. The key features of the proposed instrument, namely fast,                  small-volume PCR, fluorescent detection and reaction chamber cleaning will be        developed and demonstrated within the Phase I project. Phase II will entail the      development of a complete prototype instrument and demonstration of high-speed,      low-volume processing of samples using selected protocols.                           PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  This work will result in advanced-performance commercial PCR analysis instruments.  These will allow researchers to more rapidly make important discoveries using high-throughput  screening assays and be the basis for an efficient and cost effective system for genetic and  infectious disease diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): The numbers of youth who are addicted        to nicotine continue to rise. Provided that people who become addicted to            nicotine during adolescence are much more likely to continue smoking as adults       and thus, suffer the devastating health consequences of smoking in later             adulthood, great efforts must be initiated to help youth to quit smoking. To         date, few interventions have been developed to assist youth to quit smoking. In      response to the need of cessation interventions targeting youth, Danya               International, Inc. developed a multifaceted smoking cessation intervention          (Adolescent Smoking Cessation Escaping Nicotine and Tobacco: ASCENT)                 developmentally appropriate and based on cognitive theory for ages 14-18 (in         Phase I). The intervention includes a six session smoking cessation curriculum,      incorporated facilitator's guide, and a motivational video (Last Drag, First         Step). During Phase II, a support website will be developed, and the curriculum      and video from Phase I will be finalized. In addition, in Phase II, a                two-tiered evaluation of the intervention will be conducted. The first tier, an      outcome evaluation, is designed to determine the efficacy of the program in the      target population and the second, the process evaluation, is intended to create      a \"real world\" case study to document the process of implementing the entire         program and determine effectiveness of the additional website component.               PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The proposed intervention package will provide an attractive, comprehensive, and relatively immediate method to address teen smoking in this country. It is anticipated that the program will be marketed to schools, community-based programs and clinics, health maintenance organizations, and state health departments.",

Research in the alcohol prevention field strongly           suggests that interventions should be implemented before the onset of alcohol        use. By targeting elementary school children with an engaging, interactive           alcohol prevention effort, Kidsdom can be used in schools and at home to             influence knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy and behavior as they relate to         alcohol prevention. Although a number of health-related Internet sites and           curricula exist for children in this age group, none provide comprehensive           technology to present strong research-based content specifically about alcohol.      During Phase I, a prototype was developed and a pilot evaluation determined          that Kidsdom was both feasible and effective. In Phase II, the remainder of the      site will be programmed, curriculum components such as a teachers' guide and         parent materials will be developed, and a large scale evaluation will be             conducted to determine the effectiveness of Kidsdom in fostering knowledge,          protective attitudes, self-efficacy and safe behavior with regard to alcohol         use. During Phase III, Kidsdom will be marketed to schools and parents               nationwide.                                                                          PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The key of Kidsdom marketing will be to reach decision-making adults who intersect with  youth primed to respond to our message.  We will do this through strategies to penetrate  three broad market segments: educators, therapeutic resources and extracurricular educators.  Kidsdom will be sold both as a curriculum package and as a home gaming program.",

This development will provide a unique 6-DOF-motion simulator currently not availableand extend the capabilities of current Flight Motion Simulators (FMS).  The introduction of a unique on-cascaded gimbal configuration offers the ability to extend the closed loop frequ4ncy  response of this motion simulator to the 100 Hz region.  CurrentFMS are limited to <50Hz frequency response.   This new concept no only provides the three angular degrees of freedom, but also provides three degrees of translation necessary to simulate airframe vibration.  The motion base in based on a variant of ahexapod configuration.  Unique pivots are utilized to provide low friction coupling between the platform and actuators.  The high modal frequency is achieved by using graphite epoxy composite for the platform structure and actuator struts.   Amulti-variable feedback system, which used the actuator position and platform inertial accelerations, provides a control system directly related to the airframe coordinate frame.  The system provides control of the three angular rotations and three lineardisplacements, each control loop exhibiting a 1000 Hz bandwidth.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         60119          Swiftly flowing ocean currents represent a significant untapped renewable energy resource for the United States.  However, ocean current energy systems have not been economically feasible due to: (1) the difficulty of maintaining system stability while concurrently being able to quickly relocate the system to maximize power generation efficiency as current speeds change at varying depths, and (2) the difficulty of maintaining underwater systems.    This project will develop an ocean current turbine,  based upon wind turbine design and adapted for operation in the marine environment.  This turbine design provides robust, cost-competitive electricity generation and allows for depth-adjustable operation such that power generation may be optimized and extreme velocities and effects of surface traffic and events may be evaded.  In particular, this project addresses one of the principal areas of concern, that of controls development and demonstration.  Phase I constructed a solids model of the generating platform, identified the distribution of masses and displacements, and developed a complex three-dimensional computational model to predict platform response to operating conditions and controls algorithms.  A controls document was established that defines the controls architecture of the platform and establishes a basis for model sensing and actuation of control surfaces.  Phase II will expand this effort by constructing a scale physical model of the platform and systems controller, and testing them in the Navys tow tank.                        Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The competitive cost of generated electricity, coupled with the development of a native, renewable energy resource should drive rapid commercialization of the proposed current turbine towards large-scale electricity generation.  This development should strengthen the nations renewable energy portfolio, contributing significantly to carbon dioxide abatement.  The development is also expected to generate significant employment for American shipyards and other industries associated with electric power generation",

Despite the obvious benefits, few Americans have ever eaten unprocessed soybeans. The dry beans that farmers in the U.S. produce are difficult to cook and have a pungent bean flavor. Vegetable soybeans harvested just prior to full ripeness have not yet converted their natural sweetness to starch, so they have a sweet taste and retain refreshingly crisp texture. These vegetable soybeans easily lend themselves to a wide variety of dishes, bringing the natural qualities of soybeans to an even wider market. Research into producing vegetable soybeans will involve: (1) Implement the results of Phase I to produce marketable vegetable soybeans; (2) Investigate the control of insects and diseases in organic and conventional planting; (3) Investigate high quality and efficient mechanical harvesting procedures; (4) Develop a mechanical processing system for post harvest management; (5) Develop a marketing strategy for vegetable soybeans to reach a wide range of consumers.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DVC will develop a prototype implementation of a platform independent, generic, configurable software library to provide the ability to add sophisticated spatial access methods to an existing IG.  This library will spatially group all data registered withit and provide a number of spatial access methods.  Spatial access methods include insertion and removal of objects, range queries, and intersection queries.  These methods would be independent from the database runtime structure and format used by an IG.The spatial access library will be the foundation for rigorous scene management algorithms including view-port and occlusion culling, collision detection, dynamic terrain, line-of-sight, height-above-terrain, and others.DVC also proposes to develop a sensor model that will allow real-time computation of the radiance of each object face by a pre-processor system.  These computations are a function of time of day, the face orientation and material code.  Constants for thismodel can be generated off line and used in real time with material codes.We will also develop and prototype a post processor card that will modify the video output from the pre-processor (or existing FLIR IG) before passing it on to the display.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         60668       This project will develop a new ion source for producing rare isotope (RI) beams, used in nuclear physics research, by replacing primary accelerators with the Plasma Focus (PF) machine.  The PF Rare Isotopes breeder should produce very intense beams (1010RI/s), be larger by a factor of thousands, save time for experiments, and permit study of problems not otherwise possible.  In Phase I, experiments proved 90-95% evacuation of RI from the PF chamber, consistent with the model increase of RI breeding when energy storage was upgraded from W=7kJ to W =18kJ (quadratic increase of breeding with W).  Theoretical work estimated that to satisfy the needs of the accelerator at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the leader in nuclear research with Rare Isotopes Beams, the PF machine should have W =75kJ with 2 Hz pulse repetition rate.   Phase II will build the PF machine (W =50kJ) to operate in single pulse mode (0.1 Hz) and demonstrate RI breeding efficiency for 17F and other RI.  The efficiency of the RI extraction and delivery to external storage will be demonstrated.                          Commercial Applications And Other Benefits as described by the awardee: Commercial applications include rare isotopes beams used in nuclear/astrophysical research, biomedicine, and PETscan.  With Plasma Focus the cost of production, of short live radioisotopes (11C, 13N, 15O, 18F) used in medical diagnostics should be three times lower.   Additional competitive advantages, compared to current systems using cyclotrons, include no neutron radiation, no radio-material waste along the reprocessing line, and lower maintenance costs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         We propose a new approach to the fabrication of large, low scatter diffractive optics using a hybrid of existing off-the-shelf methods. Although several techniques are used to make diffractive optics, no single method is currently capable of the large clear aperture size, wavefront accuracy and surface quality that our proposed hybrid method offers. Using existing tools, an accurate DOE pattern is transferred to the final substrate through three proprietary steps, successively removing surface roughness and edge errors with each step. Our approach will allow the fabrication of large (greater than 1 meter), lightweight, low cost diffractive optics on both planar and curved surfaces for NASA applications. The resulting surface smoothness and flatness should be as good or better than is found on refractive optics made by traditional polishing processes, with a wavefront perfection only found with diffractive optics. These devices can fulfill advanced imaging and light gathering missions never before attempted using off-the-shelf fabrication methods, and materials that cannot be diamond turned. The proposed method can also be used in the fabrication of plane and powered gratings and multilevel sub-wavelength structures.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Active sonar operations are a key to effective USW performance in ocean environments. The performance of active sonar in these scenarios is often limited by clutter. Most active de-cluttering approaches have identified classification clues that are used totry to discriminate target echo returns from clutter echo returns. These approaches have historically suffered from performance sensitivity to changes in the ocean environments.Phase I of this SBIR developed a non-parametric approach to classification thatis robust against multiple environments. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated against both simulated data and recorded at-sea data. The new classification algorithm demonstrated consistent performance across various ocean environments, includingthose where the performance of conventional classification approaches were significantly degraded.Phase II will fully specify the processing, analyze performance, implement the capability, and integrate it into the existing SH-60R Dipper software. Theintegration with the SH-60R software provides a clear transition to a Phase III effort consisting of sea test performance validation and delivery to fielded SH-60R platforms.  The DSR-TecFocus team has the unique background and experience to provide thiscapability by incorporating the existing SH-60R Dipper signal processing into an Advanced Processing Build (APB) program like the one developed by PMS425.",

Two key classes are the near field noise generated by the platform itself and the far field noise generated by interferences.We addressed these problems with an innovative approach that allows the different noise problemsto be addressed individually. In particular, the DSR/TecFocus approach offers a combination of processing algorithms to provide effective cancellation of near field noise sources and the suppression of far field interference in the data output fordetection and classification processing. The Phase I project demonstrated that the innovative concepts proposed were viable. Viability was demonstrated both in simulations and in laboratory experiments.

The important advantages that this laser concept offers include superior beam quality, efficiency, wavelength agility, and a wide range of power scaling making it useful for avariety of DOD missions.  These include communications, countermeasures, and tactical weapons.  In this approach, the molecular iodine is optically excited by well-developed, highly efficient optical sources such as doubled solid-state lasers, laserdiodes, or doubled fiber lasers. Laser output is selectable in the range of 500 nm to 1350 nm yielding a wavelength agile source.  The iodine laser gas medium can effectively act as a beam-combining medium, where it combines the output from numerous pumpaperatures into a single coherent beam.  This beam-combining feature provides a route to rapid power scaling using an incoherent array of individually coherent pump sources.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In our initial application we successfully                                argued for the need to develop a novel human biomatrix model system to examine       in vitro the neovascularization process in humans. The overall goal was and is       to develop and commercialize the new human bioassay system employing defined         Amgel matrices. This human biomatrix exhibits many advantages over existing          models. Amgel's unique physiologic properties allowed one to generate matrix         environment with defined or controllable bioactivity. Phase I work definitely        established that the 3-D Amgel system simulate discrete human vascular cell          functions in vitro. We propose two extended tasks in this second Phase to fully      accomplish our R&D; objectives. They are:                                                                                                                                  1. To establish efficient protocols for Amgel production, biomatrix analysis         and formulation at commercial scale using advanced automated technologies; and                                                                                            2. To complete the development of the defined human biomatrix systems and            validate the practical applications of final products for vascular biology           research                                                                                                                                                                  As evident from our progress, this marketable human biomatrix will be useful         for: I) evaluating the mitogenic, motogenic and differentiation responses of         human cell/tissue derived factors; 2) examining the potential regulators of          early to late neovascularization events; and 3) rapid screening of pro- and          anti-angiogenic agents. New artificial vessel system also allows one to examine      cell-matrix interactions under both physiologic and pathologic conditions.           Thus, there is significant potential for the commercialization of our human          biomatrix system for use in biomedical and pharmaceutical research.                   PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: No acceptable commercial bioassay system for angiogenesis, vasculogenesis currently exists which utilizes a defined human biomatrix. We will develop, optimize and evaluate both reusable and disposable bioassay systems. Sale of proprietary Amgel and pre-packed assay systems would have a world-wide market, both as a research and diagnoostic tool, in the hundreds of thousands of dollars in first 2-3 years. This will impact the fields of wound healing, tissue engineering and vascular diseases.",

Growing large high-quality crystals is dependent upon determining the optimal growth conditions, a difficult process with current technology due to the large amount of purified protein required. Many proteins can not be crystallized because of this requirement. The proposed project will give researchers the ability to screen conditions using much less protein, thus opening the technology of x-ray crystallography to thousands of new proteins and making it easier and more cost effective for thousands of other proteins. This innovative system will immediately benefit scientists pursuing drug development, and ultimately the general public who will experience the benefits of new drugs to treat currently untreatable diseases or improved treatment over current therapies. As additional proteins are crystallized, the need for microgravity research will also increase with the need to optimize crystal growth.",

The first objective of this project during Phase II is to continue the research anddevelopment of three shock mitigation approaches, and apply them to develop a mount or housing that protects the most susceptible component of a fuze, the accelerometer.  The three fundamental approaches in Phase I that are proving to be powerful methodsof mitigating extreme shock loads are:  (1) filter certain frequency bands with layers of materials having dissimilar impedances, (2) prevent or restrict energy flow to the device of interest using a momentum bottleneck, and (3) dissipate energy with ashape memory alloy in its superelastic mode or with other alloys that have high damping capacity.  Our second Phase II objective is to understand the mechanical properties of encapsulates, which are typically rigid polymer foams cast into place around thecircuit boards and other components to protect them from shock.  We will achieve this understanding by reviewing the literature, testing to fill in key data, and applying theories that predict the elastic properties and dispersive behavior of inhomogeneousmedia.",

Our first objective in PhaseII is to complete the research and development of fundamental blast mitigation concepts developed during Phase I.  During Phase I, we used analytical and computational methods to develop our concepts, which include usage of clothing materials and airspaces to manipulate the hazardous blast waves.  We tested our concepts experimentally with a shock tube that we built during Phase I of this project.  The second Phase II objective is to develop prototype jackets. The third objective is to demonstrate theeffectiveness of the prototype jackets experimentally.  An instrumented rig for shock tube and open-field experiments will be developed.  We will characterize soft materials dynamically with our split Hopkinson pressure bar.  We will continue collaboratingwith Natick Soldier Center to develop jacket prototypes, and to combine blast mitigation features into ballistic jackets.  Dominca's firm grasp of wave mechanics, combined with specialty computational tools and test equipment, will lead to an effectivejacket prototype.",

The proposed work plan consists of four (4) Design-Manufacture-TestIterations to produce advanced armor concepts sufficient to defeat a representative medium caliber threat. A collaborative design process will select materials which offer a balance of penetration resistance and density, are amenable to P/M+HIPencapsulation processing, and can be interfacially coupled with successive layers of materials.  Assembly and ballistic testing of prototype armor modules will provide a concurrent cost-benefit assessment of P/M+HIP armor encapsulation technology.Penetration performance will be analytically reconciled with actual materials, manufacturing, and non-destructive test data and radiographic images of the ballistic event. With TACOM and ARL assistance, specific commercial applications of this armortechnology will be identified for both upgrades of fielded systems and for incorporation into the fundamental design of future generations of armor.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This effort is concerned with the design of CES, a rule-based expert system for forecasting vehicle corrosion and deterioration.  Weight reduction and increased performances has driven the automotive industry to incorporate magnesium and aluminumcomponents in areas such as the engine compartment, frames and chassis.  Unfortunately, these metals are highly active on the galvanic series and therefore have a strong tendency to corrode when in contact with other less active metals such as steel.Although the vehicles are being designed to insolate metal couples with high galvanic corrosion potential, the probability for corrosion during field operation is increased when the components or insulator is eroded or by-passed, particularly when combinedwith other forms of corrosion such as crevice and poultice corrosion.There is a general industry need for expert intelligent software that would aid the new vehicle and component designer as well as the engineer responsible for maintaining assets subject to corrosion or other deterioration.  The CES product will addressfour areas of the vehicle life cycle.  In the preliminary design of new vehicles it will be a design assistant providing general advice from assimilated",

When developed, this device class will find use in various military, commercial and medical applications to provide mobile controlsurfaces for manipulating, pointing and tracking tasks.  The first target application is a high resolution (<10 nm linear motion), automated alignment solution for reducing the cost of optical components assembly.  To be innovative and viable, this deviceclass must demonstrate characteristics such as the ability to provide sufficient control authority, to withstand high dynamic loads, and to provide sufficient rigidity while offering the necessary mobility to accomplish a specified task.  DSM proposed toachieve this through the development of a compliant, three-dimensional parallel manipulator to serve as a scaleable pointing system or platform manipulator.  This effort combines innovative technology developments in the area of compliant mechanismresearch as well as parallel manipulator research supported by flexure-based, solid-state pivots or other zero-play joints.  This manipulator technology will be, at a minimum, capable of rotational motion about two axes and translational motion about athird axis.  This effort will create the optimal synthesis and design tools for establishing families of compliant manipulators that combine the characteristics of parallel manipulators with the low cost, scaleable capabilities resulting from a compliantstructure design.  Candidate applications of scaleable, compliant, spatial manipulators include alignment solutions for optical components assembly, miniature tracking and pointing systems for mirrors and solar arrays, view stabilization and lens focusingfor surveillance cameras, remote inspection, microsurgical augmentation and teleoperation, and microdispense applications (adhesives, combinatorial chemical analysis and screening assays, etc.)",

The system will comprise a compact 3-D stress sensingpackage that is connected via a rugged flexible cable assembly to a field-portable controls/ excitation-and-amplification source and to an integrated data acquisition / Lap Top PC arrangement. The approach to stress measurements will consist in using threesolid- or fluid-coupled high-output thin-film piezoresistive Carbon stress gauges that are orthogonal-mounted on the faces a suitable solid substrate block or behind its faces at the bottom of small fluid cavities. The 3-D sensing package will beintegrally attached to a short rigid stem that extends into a set of armored and flexible output leads. Such arrangement can be made very small ( one cubic centimeter ) or as large as needed to meet the requirements. The Carbon stress gauge is capable ofresolving stresses as low as a few PSI up 15,000 PSI or above in dynamic or static environments. Relying on nearly thirty years of experience in designing and manufacturing numerous types of soil stress sensors for UGT and AGT applications in support tonearly all US DOE and DOD Laboratories, the proposed system will be constructed and fully evaluated, and rendered functional at our test facility under simulated but representative stress environments prior to its delivery to the Army. Coupling to soil andmethods for minimizing ground disturbance will also be investigated. A very degree of success is anticipated from this effort.

Using a newly developed proprietary process currently being submitted for a provisional patent, a pilot facility will be built and operated to reclaim 400,000 pounds of active plant polyphenols for tanning, and recycle 160,00 gallons of water from 700,000 gallons of spent tanning liquor. Current scientific, engineering, and economic analyses of the method from the Phase I SBIR project indicate that this recovery system located at a 1,000 hide per day American tannery can save the facility over $200,000 year in avoided virgin tannin purchase, and disposal costs. This process seeks to make our water intensive industry more of a closed- loop and help as to achieve our long standing goal of \"near zero\" waste. There are many non- monetizable values from recovery of tannins including cleaner water being discharged from tanneries, the more efficient use of forest resources, and the preservation of an authentic American industry that uses exclusively renewable American agricultural resources as their primary raw material (cattle hides)",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Echo Technologies, Inc. proposes a Phase I program to demonstrate a new type of optical biosensor for monitoring the integrity of water reclamation systems being developed for manned spacecraft. The technical approach departs from the conventional one-sensor, one-analyte paradigm and will demonstrate the utility of an array of semi-selective optical transducers to detect classes of microorganisms. This approach is particularly useful when the specific nature of the biological contaminant may not be known in advance. The system operates as a continuous, in-line detector to ensure the proper functioning of water reclamation systems; to monitor biocide efficacy; and to provide an early warning of incipient filter breakthrough, catastrophic failure, or inadvertent contamination. Alternatively, the sensors can be configured as biofilm detectors to monitor in remote, hard to access locations. The sensors offer inherent simplicity, and unlike antibody or DNA probes, require no consumable reagents or sample preparation. The optoelectronic design is modular so that new sensing capability can be added easily and cost effectively. Also, the use of miniature, off-the-shelf integrated optical and electronic components ensures low power requirements and system reliability. These features will result in more effective use of disinfection and will minimize overall manning and expertise requirements.",

Work completed to date on the Phase I program has demonstrated (1) thefeasibility of preparing beads consisting of aluminum powder encapsulated in polyvinylalcohol, (2) conversion of these beads into porous grain mandrels having the correct bulk density, (3) conversion of these porous grains into solution solid propellantsby infusion of liquid oxidizer based on hydroxylammonium nitrate (HAN) and (4) testing the one pound motors prepared with these propellant grains.  Also, a composite case was prepared on a small demonstration grain using chopped glass fiber mat andpolyester resin.  This study has also revealed several aspects of this system that need improvement and further development.  These consist of optimizing the bead and porous mandrel grain formations, filament wound composite case formation on the mandreland development of a crosslinkable polymer so that propellant tangent modulus can be tailored to avoid slump and creep in large propellant grains.  Studies planned for this Phase II program are designed to address these concerns.",

However, manufacturing-scale production using traditional recombinant DNA techniques is problematic due to the low yield ofactive protein and complex purification. We propose to utilize a novel technique to produce hemostatic human proteins in bacteria and mammalian cells from completely synthetic genes designed in the computer.  The approach is based on the complete chemicalsynthesis of large DNA molecules encoding fibrinogen a, b and g subunits and modified versions of these genes produced as an array of component oligonucleotides that are then assembled, ligated and expressed in E. coli. This approach is enabled byinexpensive high-throughput oligonucleotide array synthesis developed by Egea Biosciences that allows complete customization of the protein/vector/expression system. To maximize expression, synthetic genes have been designed using E. coli, yeast ormammalian preferred codons to increase protein expression as well as specific sequences to enable high efficiency protein purification.  In Phase I of this project, synthetic genes for recombinant fibrinogen subunits were designed, constructed andexpressed.  Phase II of this project will continue and expand this strategy to create over 1000 variant hemostatic proteins, screen these for stability and activity, and maximize expression in bacterial and mammalian hosts. The re-engineeredgene/vector/host combination will be a platform for further sequence alterations to maximize protein expression and enable large-scale manufacturing. Artificial gene design, construction and expression will be explored for the production of recombinantactive fibrinogen and other hemostatic proteins for commercial use in",

Genetic engineering made possible by the Human Genome Project may allow the development of novel BW agents and escalation of the BW threat.  Major problems inbiological weapons defense are the identification of the biological agent, determining the pathogenic genes, and providing counteragents including vaccines and targeted antibiotics.  This application will apply techniques of high-throughput DNA sequencingto sequence conventional and non-conventional BW agents or near neighbors and develop the sequence information necessary for rapid detection and response.  Initial pilot scale sequencing has been carried out under Phase I of this award and libraries andclone resources necessary for determining the complete DNA sequence of Bacillus thuringiensis, a non-pathogenic near neighbor of Bacillus anthracis, have been developed.  Following sequencing, commercialization of this research will focus on 1) rapiddiagnostics for BW detection and 2) exploiting Egea's high-speed gene synthesis technology for implementation of a rapid counter-measures system for the immediate production of vaccines and/or therapeutic antibodies for novel agents.  The ultimatecommercial impact will be an instrumentation system capable of identifying and responding to novel BW agents such as those that could be produced through genetic engineering.",

Radioactivity detection allows accurate weapons verification, but provides too much information on the weaponry design.  An alternative is to detect otherchemicals associated with  nuclear weaponry.  EIC Laboratories has successfully developed vapor phase Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS), a sensitive (5 ppb vapor in < 30 s) gas sensing technology to locate TNT-based landmines.  This program willdemonstrate the ability of SERS to detect explosives and enrichment solvents at trace levels in the vapor phase.  The Phase I effort demonstrated trace level detection of HMX, PETN, TATB, and the enrichment solvents tributylphosphate and kerosene.  Wedemonstrated that chemical binders had a negligible effect on the vapor signature.  We also demonstrated that explosive impurities, with significantly higher vapor pressures, could be key contributors to a nuclear weapons vapor phase signature.  The PhaseII program will complete a SERS spectral survey of chemicals associated with nuclear weapons, fabricate the deliverable transportable SERS system with sensor, and create software that will automatically provide accurate nuclear weapons verification.  Goalsare collection times of <5 seconds, a system weight of <20 lbs., and vapor detection with no false positives or negatives. An instrument with the anticipated capabilities will be immediately transferable into several commercially related fields, such astrace detection of narcotics, trace detection of environmental and industrial contaminants, UXO detection, and trace detection of chemical/biological warfare agents.  EIC plans to commercialize the SERS probe for these uses.",

This unique structure is obtained by self-assembly during curing of the epoxy in the presence of a partially emersiable block copolymer containing the ion-conducting phase. Polymer electrolyte batteries based on the new electrolytes promise great configuration flexibility in design and substantially increased energy density.

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Verbatim from Applicant's Abstract): The goal of this project is        to demonstrate the feasibility of using ultrasound to temporarily make vascular      tissue and cell membranes more permeable to deliver drug to vessel walls. EKOS       has developed an ultrasound-catheter device for transmural drug delivery that        may be useful in the treatment of restenosis following balloon angioplasty.          Local ultrasound enhanced drug delivery may increase the usefulness of drugs         that are too toxic or expensive to deliver systemically. The results of Phase I      demonstrated that ultrasound can make eukaryotic cells permeable for the uptake      of exogenous materials. The permeability was correlated with aspects of the          acoustic signature radiated by the cavitation field in the cell suspension           during exposure. The aims of Phase II are to determine the effect of acoustic        parameters on molecular uptake and cell viability in simple cell suspensions         and more complex organized tissues and to develop a measure for the cavitation       mediated permeability based on acoustic signature analysis. This measure will        give a real time feedback predicting the bioeffects for optimizing therapy           delivery.                                                                            PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The EKOS product will be an ultrasound catheter device that actively delivers drug into the  artery wall for the treatment of restenosis.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The objective of this effort is to develop high performance rare earth permanent magnets with essentially constant magnet properties over a wide temperature range of -50 to 350oC, and which can survive temperatures as high as 500oC, for TWT applications.The combination of a light rare earth (Sm) with heavy rare earths (Gd, Er, and Ho) provides very low temperature coefficients of magnetic properties over a wide temperature range.  We propose to complete the development of new (Sm, Er, Gd, Ho) 2TMM17magnets that possess near zero temperature coefficients of magnetization over a broad range of temperature.  Our approaches to extend the compensation temperature and to significantly improve the energy product of temperature compensated permanent magnetsare (1) to us Ho and Er to extend the temperature of peak magnetization (Tp) since Ho and Er compounds have a much higher Tp than Gd compounds used in current temperature compensated magnets; (2) to use Ho and Er to improve magnetization at hightemperature; (3) to use Gd to maintain useful high coercivity; and (4) make new sintered temperature compensated permanent magnets with (Sm,Gd,Er,Ho) TM13 as the main phase since this 1:13 phase has high magnetization, high Curie temperature, and high Tp.The payoff for DoD and commercial systems includes temperature compensated high temperature permanent magnets that permit TWTs to operated at higher temperatures and minimize the system cooling requirements and weight.  The use of permanent magnets thatcan withstand the bakeout process will permit simplification of the permanent magnet designs, improve beam focusing, and reduce TWT manufacturing costs.  Using magnets that provide a near-constant focusing field over broad temperature range will improvesystem performance and tube life, and reduce the final focusing and test labor costs.",

The program transfers current design concepts to arugged L1/L2 P-code RF antijam system electronics module for PGM flight test demonstration, and develops critical areas of the system to meet size and temperature objectives. The solution will suppress and track jamming with rapid convergence timescompatible with the high dynamics of PGMs, and provide an effective cost/performance solution to protect GPS receivers using a single GPS dual-port aperture.

A mid-infrared (MIR) waveguide fiber optic sensor will be fabricated using selective polymer coatings to concentrate ERC vapors emanating from the mine.  Selective absorption of MIR radiation by ERCs in the sensor filmresults in changes in transmitted radiation proportional to ERC concentration occurring at wavelengths characterisitic of the ERC. Information on landmine location and quantitative/chemical signature information identifying the type of device will beavailable. Phase I demonstrated feasibility using readily vaporizable analogs of ERCs containing nitro functional groups common to most explosives.  Sensors responded immediately and continuously to the presence of these compounds.  Detection limit fornitrobenzene, closely related to ERCs in chemical nature and surface activity, was 30 ppb with an unoptimized sensor.   Phase II will involve further refinement and optimization of the sensor to achieve sub-ppb ERC detection in the presence of variablehumidity and temperature, characterization of long term sensor performance and integration with MIR spectrophotometric and microelectronic hardware for implementation in a mobile landmine sensor platform.",

In this project, new carbonate side chains will be introduced into the carbonate-siloxane polymer matrix to increase the ionic conductivity to 10-3S/cm.  New lithium salts and crosslinkers will also be evaluated to enhance the ionic conductivity.   During Phase I, synthetic methods were developed to incorporate the allyl carbonate side chains into the polysiloxane backbone.  This resulted in a thin, flexible polymer with an ionic conductivity of 2.75 x 10-4 S/cm.  Various ratios of carbonate to siloxane, siloxane to crosslinker, and carbonate to Li+ were evaluated to achieve the desired results.  Phase II will evaluate several more carbonate side chains using methods developed in Phase I.  New lithium salts and crosslinkers will be evaluated.

The selectivity of the dense ceramic membranes are superior to that of low temperature polymeric membranes.  This project will utilize mixed ionic and electronic conducting materials, which have been fabricated into dense catalytic membrane reactors that exhibit high oxygen flux.  To commercialize these materials, fabrication techniques for producing operationally stable thin films must be developed.   In Phase I, a tape-casting-based fabrication method was used to produce thin film appliqus of these membranes.  The membranes were laminated to porous supports and sintered into dense films.  Oxygen flux through these films was increased relative to thick membranes.  Phase II will improve all aspects of successful reactor operation, including the porous support formulations, match of film appliqu and porous support sintering properties, catalyst composition, and deposition techniques.  Also the membrane will be scaled up, and pressure driven oxygen separation tests will be performed.                  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: Fabrication of supported thin film membranes by readily available production methods should make these membranes cost effective for direct oxygen separation from the air in processes which require pure oxygen.  In combustion processes, for example, the use of pure oxygen will increase heating efficiency by removal of N2 diluent, with simultaneous reduction in NOx emissions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The objective of the proposed program is to develop a catalytic system for efficient conversion of carbon dioxide and hydrogen to carbon monoxide and steam (reverse water-gas shift). The technical objectives will be achieved by optimizing both the catalyst material and process operating conditions. Alumina and metal oxide supported copper has been shown to be an effective catalyst for the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, but investigations of copper exchanged zeolite catalysts have not been reported. Given the unique characteristics of aluminosilicates as a catalyst support, the application of copper exchanged zeolites to RWGS catalysis possesses a high probability of demonstrating unprecedented activity and selectivity. Copper exchanged catalysts of zeolite Y and ZSM-5 will be tested for RWGS activity, and variables such as inclusion of alkali promoters, CO2:H2 feed ratio, and temperature will be optimized. The incentive for this project is to provide a simple, cost-effective method for the condensation of potable water from an otherwise uninhabitable Martian atmosphere. Additionally, potential application of the same technology to terrestrial chemical industry provides an excellent opportunity for procurement of Phase III funding.",

The great strength and light weight that can result from incorporating these tubes into composites is the motivation behind this work. The ability of poly(m-phenylenevinylene-co-2,5-dioctoxy-p-phenylenevinylene (PmPV) to encase and promote the solvation of long carbon nanotubes, permits use of this polymer for long nanotube incorporation into epoxies. Development of resin formulations suitable for this process will include consideration of both processing and performance of the resulting composites. Epoxy formulations will contain multiple resin, modifier, hardener, and diluent components, which interact to affect the most advantages processing and performance characteristics. This will be especially true with regarded to nanotube uptake and uniformity in the epoxy resins. Optimization of a multicomponent formulation to satisfy multiple requirements is materials intensive and time consuming, therefore this project will utilize a multicriteria optimization method to refine formulations to minimize these restraints. This mathematical technique provides for the systematic formulation and processing of variables to efficiently approach optimal performance of the material. This project will result in new epoxy resins capable of fabricating high performance aerospace composites containing nanotubes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A nearly universal trend in modern technology is the continued integration of systems, and their associated devices, on decreasingly smaller scales.  While this has led to personal computers that offer more functionality and faster computational speeds, ithas also spurred the development of hybrid optoelectronic systems on a chip (SOCs).  Currently, such SOCs are receiving significant interest from the booming telecommunications industry for applications such as all optical switching, wavelength divisionmultiplexing, and optical add-drop filters.  In each of these applications active and passive optical devices are being integrated with electronic devices on the chip scale.  Consequently, modern applications are forcing the development of passive opticalcomponents whose size is reduced to a scale that is comparable to their operational wavelength.  As a result the plethora of analysis and design methods that were once applicable to passive optical element design are no longer valid.  For this reason a newsuite of computer tools need to be developed and is therefore the focus of the proposed effort.For this reason, we were awarded a Phase I project to develop such a tool.  The tool we developed was based on the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method.  For the last several years, we have developed working versions of the FDTD method forapplication to two-dimensional, three-dimensional, and axially symmetric active and passive optical elements.  In the Phase I effort we refined these methods for their application to diffractive optical modeling and developed a GUI based CAD tool.  Inaddition we also conceived of a hardware assisted implementation of the FDTD that allows the DOE CAD tool to be applied to DOEs of realistic size in a reasonable amount of computation time.In the Phase II effort we will continue our development of the hardware implementation of the FDTD method and expand its application to two- and three-dimensions.  In addition, the CAD tool will be expanded to include the ability to analyze and designadditional photonic elements such as photonic bandgap devices and micro-cavity resonators.",

The proposed strategy can be utilized inboth frequency and time domains. The Phase I study so far has demonstrated the feasibility of interfacing full-wave frequency domain electromagnetic simulators with a general-purpose linear/nonlinear circuit simulator that uses a harmonic balancetechnique. In the proposed Phase II, the full-wave simulation engines will be fully integrated with the nonlinear circuit simulator within a unified design environment. A time domain capability will also be added to address certain classes of nonlinearstructures and their transient analysis. The developed software will be validated extensively using a number of test structures including active antenna arrays and nonlinear microwave circuits. The object-oriented architecture of emPiCASSO, our commercialantenna CAD tool, will be used as the foundation of the proposed software.",

The incubation of dead, contaminated eggs can contaminate incubators and in ovo injection systems and spread disease agent to other eggs. Removing nonviable eggs improves the operation of conventional incubators by increasing the number of live eggs per incubators and protecting hatchlings from exposure to the pathogens in rotten eggs. A Thermal Candling System combines information from conventional opacity candling with egg temperature data to select live eggs both faster and more accurately than current manual or automatic systems used by the poultry industry.

These tools will also be highly modular, allowing individual home laboratories to use one or more components of the system as their needs demand. These tools will address current problems in crystallization, the rate-limiting step in protein crystallography, following isolation and purification of the target protein. We will also be integrating these tools with a Web-based Java applet to allow researchers to order custom crystallization solutions. This will alleviate researchers from having to make their own crystallization screens, which is presently one of the most tedious tasks in protein crystallization. The entire crystallographic community stands to benefit from the proposed research. As part of the further development of our crystallization database software, we will implement features to allow researchers to easily transfer crystallization data to and from the Protein Data Bank. These publicly accessible crystallization data can then guide other researchers in their crystallization efforts. As protein crystallography becomes an increasingly important aspect of biological research, the proposed tools will make protein crystal structure determination a more routine part of any biological research program.

Emerald         BioStructures, Inc. has successfully completed a Phase I SBIR research program       that sought to elucidate the X-ray crystal structure of human       topo I in complex with one or another CPT-analogue. We now seek Phase 2 SBIR         funds to conduct an integrated structure-based drug design cycle using our 2.0       angstrom structural information of Topotecan bound to the human topo I-DNA           covalent complex. We will employ standard computational methods to formulate a       three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) model       for the camptothecin-type compounds. The 3D-QSAR model will be validated and         extended with X-ray crystal structures of additional camptothecin analogues.         The Available Chemicals Database and the World Drug Index will be                    computationally interrogated for ligands that fit into the Topotecan binding         pocket of the topo I-DNA binding site. The 3D-QSAR information will be combined      with the predicted ligand binding information and chemical intuition to design       completely novel camptothecin analogues that have enhanced formulative               properties (complete E-ring stability, efficient liposome encapsulation, facile      conjugation to polyethylene glycol). The novel camptothecin analogues will be        synthesized, purified, and tested for their inhibitory effects on topo I             activity, their affinity for the covalent complex using immobilized topo I-DNA       covalent complexes, and their cytotoxicity to human tumor cell lines.

The effects of      introducing anti-sickling agents were also clearly resolved in the results. In       addition, the acoustic measurements performed on 5 normal blood samples              revealed the techniques sensitivity by demonstrating the reproducible                resolution of the minute acoustic response to de-oxygenation of normal blood.                                                                                             With the basic response question settled, the primary aim of the Phase II            effort will be to develop a laboratory prototype that can be used by a third         party to support anti-sickling drug research efforts, general sickle cell            research, as well as be potentially used as a potential diagnostic tool in           clinical settings. In order to accomplish this goal, the following specific          aims will be pursued under Phase II: 1. An improved experimental prototype will      be designed. 2. A stable and repeatable test substrate (cell suspension) will        be developed. 3. The device will be characterized extensively with regard to         calibration, sensitivity, and sample variability. 4. The effects of an               extensive number of anti-sickling agents will be measured.    PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Not Available",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atrial Fibrillation is an electrical            malfunction of the upper pumping chambers of the heart causing major medical         and lifestyle problems. The current treatments are pharmaceutical (side effects      and minimal effectiveness), pacemakers (after destroying the electrical system       of the heart, expensive and moderately effective), and electrically isolating        areas of the heart using the MAZE procedure - surgically cutting the heart and       sewing back together creating scar tissue to block malfunctioning electrical         pathways. This MAZE procedure has proven to be nearly 100 percent effective,         however it is long and extraordinarily difficult. Due to the promising concept,      this approach is aggressively being investigated using ablation catheters and        probes to create lesions. However, to isolate electrical pathways, a complete        electrical block in the tissue must be made and these technologies are limited       in their ability to create transmural lesions. With these technologies,              charring and extensive atrial damage occur, which can increase risk of stroke.       Our technology addresses these issues by incorporating RF Bipolar energy into a      device that will quickly and safely create a transmural linear lesion, from          endocardium to epicardium, in a single application while protecting the              surrounding tissue. In Phase I we will fabricate a prototype and evaluate our        lesions for transmurally and ability to electrically isolate tissue.   PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Our technclogy will overcome the limitations of the current methods of treating atrial fibrillation (AF) and can be used to treat AF during open-heart procedures and to reduce the occurrence of post-operative AF episodes. This market alone exceeds $1.2 BB/year. The devices that can be developed using this technology have a strong potential of being incorporated into minimally invasive procedures adding an additional $1.5 BB to the market potential.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         60774       In order to be commercially competitive, Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells have to meet an acceptable level of performance and cost targets for building applications.  Most fuel cell performance losses occur at the cathode oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).  Improvements in cathode performance are needed in order to increase fuel cell efficiency and reduce stack cost.  This project will develop high performance PEM fuel cell cathode structures that will provide more than a three-fold increase in density (at 0.8V) compared to present state-of-the-art Pt-based cathodes.  In Phase I, the PEM fuel cell cathode was improved by enhancing proton conduction and adding oxygen flux agents to the catalyst layer.  A gain of approximately 15% in power density was obtained when the local environment around the Pt catalyst was modified.  Phase II will examine the fundamental activity of the catalyst using a new understanding of the oxygen reduction reaction and will incorporate the catalyst into an improved cathode structure.  Also, candidate proton and oxygen flux agents will be optimized, and a nano-scale platinum electrocatalyst will be developed.                       Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The technology should reduce the cost of PEM fuel cells and accelerate the commercialization of PEM for many power generation including portable devices, transportation, distributed generation, and on-site power units for buildings.",

Our technical approach is centeredon the ability of the system to collect massive amounts of LIDAR data easily accessible to a user in a timely and efficient manner. This will be handled within a database and map library framework, in which interactively selected tiles of LIDAR data can beprocessed and classified using feature extraction techniques. Bare earth surfaces can be generated, with resultant residual information (non-bare earth features) being further classified in order to extract elevations of vegetation canopies and buildingfootprints.",

EnerTechs innovative Wet Carbonization technology will transform heterogeneous metabolic wastes and trash components, through moderate temperature and pressure carbonization, into a uniform and pumpable slurry, which will be combusted in NASA's fluid-bed combustion and gas cleanup system, producing emissions that are within SMAC standards. The CO2 and H2O generated during conversion of the wastes can be used to support plant growth systems and provide for a closed-loop, regenerative life support system. The objective of this Phase I proposal is to determine the characteristics of the product slurry from Wet Carbonization experiments and an acceptable range of combustion conditions that are within SMAC standards. In Phase I, Wet Carbonization and advanced combustion experiments will be conducted with existing bench-scale facilities using inedible biomass and human feces.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Not Available This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will continue to develop and demonstrate a computational tool for detailed simulation of Rapid thermal processing (RTP) in a distributed computing environment by taking advantages of the findings in Phase I. RTP has become a key technology in the fabrication of advanced semiconductor devices. As wafers get larger and chip dimensions smaller, the understanding of the highly coupled physics such as radiative heat transfer, transient fluid flow and heat transfer as well as chemical reactions through numerical modeling using high-performance computing is the key to the design, optimization, and control of RTP reactors. In Phase II, A 3D surface radiation model based on the modified discrete transfer method (MDTM) will be developed to treat radiative transfer in the lamphouse and process chamber as a whole process. The detailed pattern effects will be taken into account by rigorously solving time-domain Maxwell's equations through a finite volume approach. The rarefied gas dynamics in low pressure RTP will be modeled by adding Burnett terms into the Navier-Stokes equations. The governing equations that contain various multi-disciplinary physical models will be solved by a 3D unstructured finite volume method. To address computationally intensive 3D simulation needs, an efficient parallel strategy will be implemented in the solution procedure. Data communication among parallel processors will be conducted by the Message Passing Interface (MPI) library. To accelerate the overall solution convergence and improve the parallel performance, the algebraic multi-grid (AMG) method will be used to solve the discretized equations in each processor. It is expected that the proposed simulation tool can be used to systematically investigate the underlying physics occurring in RTP systems, and to help in the design, optimization, and control of RTP reactors. The proposed simulation tool will significantly benefit the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industries that require a detailed understanding of multimode and highly coupled transport phenomena. The potential applications include the design, optimization, and control of RTP reactors and many other manufacturing and materials processing systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         60982         High temperatures in geothermal and deep petroleum wells exceed the maximum operating temperature of conventional electronics.  This makes it expensive to obtain even the most basic downhole measurements and limits the type, quality, and quantity of data that can be obtained.  This paucity of downhole data contributes to poor reservoir management and inefficient extraction of valuable natural resources.   Using newly available high-temperature electronic components, this project will develop a low-cost, high-temperature, reprogrammable Universal Logging Computer.  In Phase I, the Universal Logging Computer (ULC) architecture was completed, indicating that a system is feasible using available Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) component technologies.  Innovative electronic designs were completed and simulated to overcome challenges of operating in high temperature environments up to 250C.  Preliminary mechanical tool designs were completed by two geothermal service companies, advanced substrate materials were identified and tested, and a unique solderless component interconnect technique was developed.   Phase II will develop low temperature module prototypes; fabricate downhole tool mechanical packages; field test downhole tools incorporating low temperature module prototype; develop a high temperature ROM mask for 8051 CPU; develope rugged high temperature packaging for modules; development of high temperature module prototypes; and field downhole tools incorporating high temperature module prototypes.                   Commercial Applications And Other Benefits as described by the awardee: A high-temperature Universal Logging Computer should allow logging companies to easily design their own electronics packages.  This would enable the geothermal and petroleum industries to commercialize loggings tools for a wide variety of applications, leading to more effective reservoir modeling and resource management in high-temperature reservoirs.",

Our approach synergistically merges conventional GPS, GPSinterferometry, and Micro Electro-mechanical System (MEMS) inertial components to achieve a high performance, low cost solution. GPS interferometry, coupled with accelerometer and rate gyroscope components, allows attitude determination under all vehicledynamics. The resulting AHRS will perform better than solutions traditionally used with antenna systems, and will contribute 50 times less to the system cost. Enpoint will mechanize the interferometric processing, MEMS IMU interface, and navigationsolution on a next-generation Digital Signal Processor (DSP). We will optimize the GPS carrier-tracking loops and code-tracking loops to account for availability of acceleration and attitude measurements will enable robust GPS operation under adversemotion and interference conditions. In 2 different demonstrations, we will combine the Enpoint low cost AHRS with a communication system to show the potential for achieving high data rate communications from mobile platforms at low cost.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project is designed to develop and demonstrate a new in situ treatment technology for the destruction of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) in groundwater. The gasoline additive MTBE is the second most prevalent groundwater contaminant in the United States, and there are currently no economical technologies for its removal from the water supply. This technology utilizes a novel bacterium of the species Hydrogenophaga flava (ENV735) for the remediation of MTBE. This bacterium, which was recently isolated by Envirogen scientists, is one of only two bacterial strains discovered that are capable of growth on MTBE. Phase II experiments will be conducted to: (1) assess the movement and distribution of the bacterium in the subsurface; (2) develop an adhesion-deficient strain for improved aquifer distribution; and (3) optimize commercial-scale growth, shipment, and injection of the bacterium for field application. A field demonstration will be conducted to fully test the technology under in situ conditions. The bioaugmentation with ENV735 has broad potential as an in situ remediation technology for MTBE-contaminated aquifers. If the results of the field trial are positive, commercialization of the bioaugmentation technology is anticipated in the short term",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The availability of large format, multicolor, high performance infrared focal plane arrays is of the utmost importance to future DoD missions.  The semiconductor HgCdTe is the material of choice for multicolor arrays due to its bandgap tunabilitythroughout the infrared spectral range and its high quantum efficiency.  Present day 2nd generation focal plane array technology, based on the hybridization of HgCdTe arrays with separate Si readout circuitry, is facing severe limitations to futuredevelopment due to thermal mismatches, vibration failures,  and parasitic capacitances.  We propose a low cost, 3d generation technology that will lead to the production of the necessary multicolor, large format, high performance focal plane arrays.  Theapproach employs a monolithic architecture where the HgCdTe array is grown directly on the Si readout circuit, immediately eliminating the difficulties of the hybrid approach.  Our successful Phase I effort had fully demonstrated the proof of concept.  Inthis Phase II project, we propose the production of single and two color (short- and mid-wave infrared) monolithic array heterostructures will be grown and processed on the silicon circuitry( with intermediate CdTe buffer layers) and monolithic integrationwill be accomplished.  The high performance, low cost, monolithic arrays to be produced will have many military and commercial applications. They include night vision and poor weather imaging for military operations, night driving, aircraft landing,commercial trucking, ship navigation and search and rescue; target identification; surveillance; fire rescue in smoke-filled environments; industrial applications such as process control, large area temperature monitoring and preventative maintenance;environmental monitoring for pipe leaks, hazardous material spills, automobile exhaust emissions, and the status of high power electrical systems; and non-invasive medical measurements of temperature for tumors and blood flow.",

Such device architectures require not only reliable extrinsic n- and p-type doping of HgCdTe but also the precise control of composition and doping profiles. This can be best achieved using Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) within a single growthrun for a specific architecture. Although n-type doping with indium is well under control in MBE-HgCdTe, the situation concerning p-type doping with arsenic, which is the most suitable acceptor, is not satisfactory. In current technology, a hightemperature anneal above 400C is necessary to activate the arsenic species into acceptors. It is mandatory to develop a viable, reproducible and effective p-doping approach that does not involve thermal treatments above 250C in order to preserve thecompositional and doping profile integrity of HgCdTe-based structures. In Phase I, we demonstrated that in-situ As-doped MWIR HgCdTe can be p-type activated after a thermal anneal at 250C through a proprietary two-step process. In Phase II, we propose tooptimize this process by a precise control of arsenic incorporation and site transfer. The assessment of success will be established through the device processing and testing of p/n and n/p heterostructures with the goal of exceeding the reportedperformance of LWIR ion implanted structures.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         APPLICANT?S DESCRIPTION: EraGen will develop a new functional genomics software suite that helps scientists use genomic sequence data to solve biological and biomedical problems in this Phase II period. The product will take the scientist beyond classical approaches to sequence annotation, which use BLAST searches to identify homologs, and assume that two proteins related by common ancestry must have analogous functions. The Phase I period demonstrated that this approach to database annotation is often misleading, and frequently misses meaningful interpretations in metazoan proteins. The Phase II period will refine and fully develop the software initiated in Phase I. This software will serve to identify where function might have changed during divergence of a sequence family, and also where recruitment of function has occurred using rates of change from the DNA sequence. In addition, the tools to exploit probabilistic ancestral sequences for both protein/protein and DNA/protein alignments will be fully developed. These tools will detect distant homologs, identify errors across sequence databases, and augment current approaches to gene finding.  PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Not Available",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Decision makers often confront deep uncertainty where standard decision support tools fail to provide support.  Sophisticated planners seek strategies robust across a wide range of plausible scenarios.  But most analytical tools attempt to optimize for aparticular future lending little aid in the search for robust minimal regret strategies.  Robustness is more challenging computationally than optimization.  This has left a large gap between intuition and analytical support.  However, recent advances incomputer technology have made possible a revolutionary new generation of decision support tools.  In this project, Evolving Logic will use its experience with its Computer Assisted Reasoning r technology to build a prototype system for robust, adaptiveplanning under conditions of deep uncertainty.  The prototype will be generalizable to specific applications combining the best features of scenario planning with traditional quantitative approaches.  Means for rapidly adapting this technology to a rangeof military and commercial applications will also be developed.  The result will be an unprecedentedly powerful yet intuitive way for decision-makers, even those with little experience or quantitative facility, to design and understand the strengths andweaknesses of various plans in full view of the inherent uncertainties and for groups of planners to draw inferences and gain insights from within existing planning and decision-making institutions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         60108        The United States is the largest producer of refined petroleum products in the world, with 25 percent of global production and 163 operating refineries.  U.S. refineries are also the largest energy consumers in manufacturing and spend $4-$6 billion annually in pollution abatement costs.   Ultimately, such cleaner-by-design process technologies that use engineered catalysts could cut down significantly on energy usage and bring about a paradigm shift in the petroleum refining industry.  This project will develop a light naphtha isomerization technology using catalytic distillation, which will produce isomerate (iso-pentanes and iso-hexanes) having a higher octane rating than conventional fixed-bed technologies.   In Phase I, the hydrodynamic feasibility of using a multifunctional catalyst substrate in a multi-phase, counter-current, reactor operation was established.    Phase II will develop the multifunctional solid-acid that will be used in a catalytic distillation reactor to produce isomerate from normal paraffins.  Multifunctional catalysts will be designed, synthesized, and tested in both fixed-bed and catalytic distillation reactors.  Information from the performance tests will be used to optimize catalyst design, reactor configuration, and process parameters.                     Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) has been banned as a gasoline additive in California, and groundwater contamination associated with MTBE has forced refiners all over the world to find a viable alternative.  An appropriate blend of C5-C6 isomerates with alkylates would match the volatility of gasoline and be a perfect replacement for MTBE.  The new isomerization technology would thus provide U.S. refiners with a viable alternative to MTBE.",

In this project, an innovative process modeling technique will be used to detect sensor and equipment failures with higher accuracy and faster response time than previously available methods, thereby improving efficiency, reducing downtime, and lowering operating and maintenance cost for power-generating facilities.  Phase I demonstrated the techniques and analytical metrics necessary to optimize a diagnostic model of a monitored process and quantify its expected performance.  The analytical metrics were shown to be effective measures of model quality.  Innovations included new techniques to select optimal model settings, predict in-service sensitivity and false alarm rate, and perform model self-checking.  The feasibility and benefit of optimizing the model for improved detection of signal faults and equipment failures in nuclear power plant applications was demonstrated.  Phase II will create a general-purpose online diagnostic software package that enables the rapid, cost effective deployment of this technology.  The effort will be coordinated with nuclear power industry efforts to deploy the technology.  Benefits will be quantified for nuclear plant online signal validation, thermal efficiency optimization, and equipment fault detection.                Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: Online signal validation should benefit any monitored process where time-critical safety or control functions depend on sensor input, or where unexpected process interruptions due to sensor and equipment failures or false alarms are unsafe or uneconomical.

        "abstract": "Abstract         60585         Fischer Tropsch (F-T) synthesis is a promising process for producing high quality, environmentally clean, diesel fuels. However, the separation of catalyst fines from the Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) reactor product stream has been a major impediment to applying the technology for the conversion of hydrocarbon resources such as coal and petroleum coke to clean burning fuels.  This project will develop a novel magnetic method for the efficient separation of iron-based catalysts from F-T wax.  The method addresses problems associated with the high concentration and small particle size of catalysts used in F-T production of wax from synthesis gas, produced in gasification of coal and other hydrocarbon resources.  In Phase I, the concentration of wax in analog liquids was reduced from 20 Wt.% to 0.2 Wt.% in continuous operation over long time periods.  Catalyst was successfully separated from Fischer-Tropsch wax at elevated temperature, and the effects of major process parameters were determined.  High-gradient magnetic filtration of the output produced a clear wax with particle concentration less than 500 ppm.  Operating costs for a bare continuous separator were estimated between $2 and $3 per 1000 gallons.  Phase II will acquire and activate a significant amount of iron catalyst, build a test bed suitable for optimization of the technology, carry out extended runs at elevated temperature and pressure to confirm the robust nature of the technology,and perform a conceptual engineering evaluation of a 15gpm pilot unit.                     Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee: The technology should be useful for the continuous and low cost separation of magnetic particles from elevated temperature and viscous process streams, including hydrocarbon streams, fuel products, and chemicals.  The technology is also applicable to recovery of micro-sized magnetite media used in ore dressing and coal cleaning.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Blast parameter measurement is imperative to improve and verify current theoretical predictions of new weapon effectiveness and structural responses to blasts. A number of variables such as fuse initiation, explosive charge shape, charge burn rate, andambient conditions determine blast wave characteristics and complicate theoretical predictions. Experimental verification of theoretical models is difficult because current state-of-the-art pressure and acceleration sensors are not capable of accuratelymeasuring the blast pressure wave. Their main disadvantage is limited frequency response, but also suffer from triboelectric cable noise, pyroelectric errors, and electromagnetic interference. F&S; Inc. proposes to design miniature, rugged, fiber opticpressure and acceleration sensors capable of accurate blast wave measurement. The sensors possess improved frequency response, ultra-small size, EMI immunity, multiplexing capabilities, wide operational temperature range, and remote sensor interrogation upto several kilometers away. This new class of sensors will enable researchers to achieve much greater spatial resolution while maintaining excellent measurement resolution for miniature-scale blast tests that save time and money over similar experimentsconducted at full scale. F&S; has assembled an experienced research and development team to demonstrate the feasibility of the sensors during Phase I and continued work during Phase II to ensure successful commercialization of this technology. BENEFITS: F&Senvisions; commercial applications for these devices in industrial explosive device testing found in the oil and mine industry and road construction. Sensors developed in this program will also find applications in high pressure measurement in harshenvironments such as gas turbine engines, oil refineries, industrial manufacturing processes, and down-hole petroleum monitoring.",

The threat to armed forces can be reduced by early detection of deleterious agents prior to any human contact.  The probability of usingsuch weapons by a hostile force increases as they become more prevalent.  This further emphasizes the need for field deployable systems that are capable of detecting chemical agents and alerting forces to their location.  Luna Innovations will address thiscritical need through integration of technology demonstrated during the Phase I program into a complete detection system.  Luna has demonstrated battery-powered optical fiber support electronics having a wireless communication system with globalpositioning capability, a fiber optic based biosensor utilizing immobilized enzymes to detect chemical agents, and an air sampling system that is capable of providing a liquid based sample.  During the Phase II program, Luna Innovations and its teammembers propose to complete development and commercialization of the field deployable chemical point detection network.  Luna believes this technology will benefit the U.S. military and numerous commercial applications by improving the sampling time,sensitivity, flexibility, portability, and selectivity of current detection system technology.  Research concerning a miniature detection system with wireless and GPS capability will yield high-resolution, low-cost, multi compound, affinity systems formilitary and municipal emergency response and rescue operations.

For a gas turbine engine test cycle, up to 9 months are required to installand calibrate over 1000 sensors on the engine, costing several million dollars.  In response, wireless technology is proposed to decrease instrumentation set-up time and operating costs by replacing conventional wired connections, eliminating the expensiveinterconnection cabling and routing.  Unfortunately, no wireless systems are currently available that can withstand the harsh environmental conditions present in aerospace testing facilities.  Luna Innovations proposes the development of a wireless sensorsystem for aerospace area ground test applications.  All situations where a reliable, low cost wireless sensor link can be established in lieu of wires/cables will directly result in major savings to the Air Force during installation, testing andturnaround.  The miniature battery powered telemetry unit will be designed to meet the necessary system performance metrics and withstand the necessary environmental constraints.  The system will be capable of interfacing with common sensors (such asstrain, pressure and temperature) as well as differential analog signals, broadcasting this information to a central using a broadband wireless link.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         For companies engaged in the development of new antenna designs, antenna measurement systems represent a huge initial cost, and a significant barrier to entry into the market. Antenna measurement systems typically use a frequency domain Vector NetworkAnalyzer (VNA) and anechoic chamber or large outdoor range. The cost of such systems starts at around $300,000, which is more than most small companies can afford. When characterizing ultra-wideband (UWB) antennas, the cost of frequency domain measurementsis even greater, because the data must be taken at many frequencies, which requires additional time.To address these cost and time issues, a new technology is now available that allows one to measure the characteristics of antennas in the time domain. Such time domain antenna ranges will have one-quarter the cost of a conventional range. They willprovide meaningful measurements over two decades of bandwidth, in either the frequency or time domain. They will also be readily stowed and deployed as required.During Phase I we assembled a prototype automated antenna measurement system. The system features full computer control both of the orientation (azimuth and elevation) of the antenna under test, and of data acquisition by a digital sampling oscilloscope.During Phase II, we will refine the physical package to make it compact, rugged, and easy to set up, stow, and transport. We will also enhance the software to provide full system automation, including data acquisition sequencing, and complete signalprocessing, to provide online, near-real-time recovery of antenna response data in time and frequency domains. We will automatically deconvolve the system response from the measured response. At the end of Phase II, we will be able to sell commercially aturnkey, fully field-deployable system, covering a broad frequency range. The accuracy of the new time domain automated antenna range will be demonstrated to be comparable to that of conventional ranges.",

In addition, existing performance tests and batteries were surveyed and evaluated to define the state-of-the-art in cognitive testing.  Innovative techniques forrelating cognitive functions to tests were also explored and evaluated.  From these exercises, preliminary recommendations were developed concerning which tests should be included in a comprehensive assessment system.  In Phase II, we propose to carry theabove preliminary investigations to a final level, and to physically implement the recommended assessment system in hardware and software.  This product would be delivered to the Government, and adapted for civilian commercial use.

        "abstract": "Abstract         There is a significant and growing NASA requirement for small efficient space communications amplifiers in the range of five- to 50-watts at 20 GHz and above. These powers are too high for solid state technology. Traveling wave tubes, on the other hand, are not very efficient at these low power levels as currently constructed. Also, their price per-watt is high, as is their size and weight per-watt. We propose to close this technology gap with a revolutionary miniature TWT design that can be constructed for under a few hundred dollars and utilizes cathode ray tube design and assembly technology. It will be electrostatically focussed and use a ladder-type slow wave circuit. Feasibility will be tested in PHASE I using sophisticated computer modeling tools for the RF and focusing structures. A prototype beam tester will be constructed to analyze beam-focussing parameters and a slow wave structure will be constructed and cold tested. The objective is to determine if the focusing and RF structures can be combined in one integrated device, and, if so, over what range of frequency, power, bandwidth and beam perveance.CRT fabrication techniques, such as glass-rodded assemblies and all-glass envelope construction will be tested - with a view to mass-producing miniature, low mass TWT's.

This project focuses on strain       improvement in a bacterium that generates a widely used antibiotic,                  erythromycin. This bacterium, Saccharopolyspora erythraea, is a member of the        Actinomycete family and is widely used in academic research and industry,            making it an excellent model system for this work. The objective of this             project is to identify and manipulate genes responsible for controlling              erythromycin yield during fermentation. In Phase I a mutagenic plasmid               insertion library was created in Sac. erythraea and four classes of                  morphological and pigmentation mutants were found using a simple visual screen.      Three classes of mutants were found that showed significant increases in             erythromycin production. An efficient plasmid rescue technique allowed recovery      of the integrated plasmid and DNA sequence analysis of the plasmid insert. In        Phase II the screening and mutant analysis will continue. The strain                 improvement genes found could have general application to strain improvement         programs for other drugs.

One of the prime material candidates is HgCdTe. The advantage of HgCdTe over InGaAs  isHgCdTe's high performance in the wavelength range of 1.7-2.5 microns.  Before such cameras are mass produced for the Army's applications, a number of issues need to be addressed.  One of the issues is to produce focal plane arrays and readout circuits withmuch lower noise, and the other is to to produce arrays with larger format and smaller pixel size.  In Phase II, we will address these two issues by producing low noise, 640x516 HgCdTe cameras and by developing 1280x1024 hybrid array miniaturizationtechnology.  Once these goals are accomplished, producing InGaAs camera with a wavelength of 1.7 micron is straightforward.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on developing technology for semi-automatically creating wrappers that extract data from semi-structured web pages. The key innovation is a bootstrapping method for wrapper generation, so that experience in wrapping previous sites can be automatically re-used to minimize the effort required to wrap new sites. The proposed technology will make it practical to create thousands of highly accurate wrappers almost completely automatically, creating new opportunities for web-based information integration. The proposed technology will enable Fetch Technologies to scale our current wrapper generation technology far beyond what his now practical. Thousands of Internet services create value for their users by aggregating and integrating information from Internet sources. The proposed technology will make these types of services radically simpler to implement. Applications include portal sites, comparison shopping services, auction sites, finance integration, and competitive intelligence-gathering services",

        "abstract": "Abstract         60647       The shotgun DNA sequencing method is in wide use for the acquisition of draft data, but it is not followed by equally productive finishing technology.  High throughput technology is needed to transform the art of finishing genome projects into a streamlined production operation.  This project will develop advanced DNA sequencing reagents and protocols that are 100 to 1,000 times more efficient than current standards and apply them for the direct sequencing of Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) and genomic DNA templates.  This will be accomplished by designing a model to optimize overall workflow in the high throughput environment and test it on ongoing genomic projects.   Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of increasing the yield of sequencing reactions.  10,000 Fimers were synthesized and applied for direct sequencing of BAC and microbial genomic DNA.  The results showed that the direct sequencing approach was suitable for further development and implementation into large scale projects.   Phase II will incorporate new enzymatic and chemical tools for more efficient sequencing of microbial genomic DNA, and overall workflow will be optimized for the high throughput environment.                  Commercial Applications And Other Benefits as described by the awardee: Rapid, cost effective finishing of genome projects should fulfill unmet demand in academic and government projects, as well as the booming biotechnology industry.  It should free genomics centers and companies from unproductive work and accelerate the overall rate of data acquisition.",

Phase I demonstrated the efficacy of the closed-loop amplifier regulated driver, determined the limitations of this topology, and identified the optimal implementation of this technology in the heavy ion fusion program.  This was accomplished by designing and assembling a bench top feasibility experiment, demonstrating waveform regulation with the bench top system, and developing the conceptual design for a prototype device.

Losses and control costs due to the corn rootworm can exceed $1 billion dollars per year. Florida Food Products, Inc., in cooperation with USDA, identified and extracted cucubitacin E. glycoside, a corn rootworm feeding stimulant/arrestant from Hawkesbury bitter watermelon (BHW), known as Invite . In Phase I, the feasibility of commercially extracting and concentrating the BHW juice was demonstrated, and its efficacy was proven in a bait formulation with 90-95% reduction in rates of insecticides. It was also shown for the first time that Invite could be used effectively in combination with a number of different insecticides at reduced rates. The proposed program is directed at the commercial production of Invite in combination with reduced insecticides, and will be applied on 500,000 acres of corn in the U.S.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Modern rotorcraft, when engaged in high speed or maneuvering flight, can experience very complex and highly non-linear aerodynamic phenomena that induce exceptionally high loads on the rotor system.  Aerodynamic and structural interactions can lead toviolent vibrations, reduced handling qualities, and reduction in fatigue life.  The principal mechanism of this behavior is dynamic stall, which involves a cyclic event of massive flow separation, the shedding and convection of a vortex over the bladesurface, and flow reattachment.Flow Analysis, Inc. (FAI) has developed a technique for predicting dynamic stall for airfoils, wings, and rotor blades that is based on the vorticity confinement method.  The method allows vortex-dominated flows to be computed on coarse grids without thedissipation normally associated with conventional CFD approaches, thereby resulting in significant computational savings.  Application to various airfoils and stall conditions has demonstrated the general applicability, accuracy, and robustness of themethod.We propose to combine in a parallel processing environment the FAI dynamic stall method (implemented in a compressible flow solver) with a comprehensive structural dynamics code.  The result will be a unique and powerful approach to dynamic stall modelingthat will be the basis for a new comprehensive rotorcraft modeling system.",

Conventional approaches to increasing voltage breakdown thresholds are often expensive and time consuming.  Using surface modification by in-situ irradiation with an electron beam, this project will develop an effective and practical method to increase voltage breakdown thresholds.  As a result, both conditioning time and dark current levels in high gradient accelerating structures should be substantially decreased.  In Phase I, the parameters of an electron beam appropriate for surface modification were determined.  A prototype system design was developed to deliver the beam to the structure.  Phase II will involve the construction and application of a system for surface modification of high voltage gradient structures.  This includes consideration of the in-situ requirements.                   Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: A new and effective means to increase voltage holdoff and lower dark current levels in radio-frequency structures should have application in medical, military, and research (particularly, the high-power klystrons that are under development at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Laboratory).",

The use of traditional configurations of skins fastened to ribs and stringers, or complicated assemblies using many pieces of machined corehave a high part count and may require a number of unique manufacturing steps to complete the part.A highly integrated structure is one possible solution to the problem.  These structures would replace the large number of individual parts used in 'traditional' aircraft manufacturing with a single component that satisfies the requirements. Componentprice and lead times are further reduced by the use of a common set of commercial off the shelf materials.  Foam Matrix has developed a unique process for net molding lofted composite structures such as wings or control surfaces.  The molded cores mayincorporate mechanical and electrical components directly into the structure without additional tools or parts.The objective of the research is to take the innovative manufacturing method developed by Foam Matrix and develop a methodology to show that parts manufactured using this process are reliable without the time and cost involved in a traditional materialqualification program",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Verbatim from Applicant's Abstract): A vital component of a             successful clinical application of HIFU surgery is an accurate assessment of         the treated tissue volume. It would be most beneficial if the HIFU-created           lesion could be visualized and controlled in real-time so that treatment             protocols could be modified to accommodate local and variable conditions in          individual patients. The goal of this proposal is to upgrade the Sonablate           device that would guide and control HIFU surgery by analyzing backscattered          ultrasound signals. In our Phase I in vitro studies, several signal processing       algorithms were successfully developed that measured changes in tissue               parameters due to HIFU exposures. In this Phase II application, we propose (1)       to utilize the signal processing algorithms developed in Phase I to separate         the effects of cavitation and heat during HIFU surgery, (2) to perform a series      of in vitro experiments to validate our signal and image processing algorithms,      (3) to modify the Sonablate device to incorporate these lesion-imaging and           control algorithms in real time, (4) to perform a series of in vivo experiments      in animals with the modified Sonablate that would test the effectiveness of          these algorithms, and (5) to perform a human feasibility study based on safe         and efficacious results from the animal studies.                                     PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  Prostate cancer is becoming an ever-more-frequent malady for man.  Current annual market  for treatment of prostate cancer in the United States is estimated around $5 billion. Currently,  Focus Surgery Inc. manufactures the Sonablate TM system, which makes use of HIFU  technology to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).  To extend the application of this  system to treat prostate cancer, a reliable non-invasive feedback mechanism is necessary.  The current proposal directly addresses this challenge.  Successful completion of this   project will open the enormous market of prostate cancer treatment for our Sonablate TM  device.",

This approach to hull repair can be very cost effective and time efficient.  The coatingsused to complete these repairs, however, disintegrate and break away from the paint brush and/or application tool, forming a cloudy mass that restricts diver visibility and makes it difficult to complete the job properly.  The poor coating/watercompatibility also results in poor transfer efficiency and the release of toxic materials into the environment.  In Phase I Foster-Miller demonstrated the feasibility of an underwater hull repair coating (adherent, durable, hydrophobic, epoxy resin -ADHER) that is water insoluble, cures underwater and offers the potential for matching/exceeding military specifications (MIL-P-24441B, MIL-P-23236B, and MIL-PRF-24647B).  In Phase II, the base ADHER resin will be combined with corrosion inhibitors,anti-fouling agents and pigments to form a functional ADHER system.  The ADHER formulation will be further refined and optimized to improve transfer efficiency and cured coating properties.  Coated ADHER test panels will be prepared and tested by industryexperts for compliance with military specifications.  Results will be analyzed, and a technical and economic assessment will be performed. (p00487)",

Hardfaced armor provides protection against (pointed) projectiles at very low arealdensities relative to other armor configurations.  The current transparent hardface materials are either unaffordably expensive (sapphire, ALON), or low performance (hard glass) leading to heavy armor.In the Phase I program, Foster-Miller proved the feasibility of an innovative transparent armor hardface material.  Sapphire nanocomposite specimens infiltrated with a model glass matrix with light transmission were produced.  The specimens showed goodhardness and modulus that was substantially higher than the base glass material.In Phase II, the materials and processes will be refined and scaled up to demonstrate repeatability in optical and mechanical properties.  Phase II will include design, fabrication and ballistic testing of specimens against selected threats.   Theperformance of the Phase II specimens will be compared against state-of-the-art transparent armor hardface materials.  A producibility and cost analysis will also be conducted.  Foster-Miller has assembled a strong team to develop the technology andcommercialize it in military applications. (P-01705)  The new sapphire nanocomposite material will provide a transparent armor hardface material with ballistic performance comparable to that of sapphire and ALON at a much lower cost.  Military applications include windows and vision blocks for armoredvehicles, aircraft transparencies, face shields and goggles, and sensor windows.  Commercial applications include windows for: Armored vehicles - executive limousines and cash transportation trucks; law enforcement vehicles; and police face shields.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Foster-Miller proposes to build upon its in-line oil monitoring technology to demonstrate and deliver an Integrated Oil Debris And Condition Sensor (IODACS) for continuous monitoring of the transmission and engine lubricants for total wear metal particles,contaminants and oil condition. This on-board sensor will increase the reliability of Health Usage Monitoring System (HUMS) trending, providing sufficient information to enable true prognostics for early detection of impending failures. Debris andcontaminants in oil are known to degrade viscosity and damage internal components. It has been suspected to be the reason for the recent catastrophic flight control failures and corrosive pitting on Army helicopter platforms. The proposed IODACS wouldreplace electromagnetic chip detectors that capture a fraction of the metal particles, which have been proven to be insufficient for effective fault isolation and off-line lubricant condition analysis and detection of contaminants that have long turnaroundtimes and require ground logistics and maintenance support.IODACS will be a unique monitor sensor of a size, weight, robustness and cost suitable for use on-board helicopters. Phase II will address software and hardware integration and develop automated condition recognition protocols for real-time input to theon-board HUMS and implementation of condition based maintenance (CBM) practices.

        "abstract": "Abstract         As advancements in the semiconductor industry continue at a phenomenal pace, traditional printed wiring board (PWB) materials and  technologies are approaching significant limitations. Higher density interconnections are required between ICs. Circuitsoperating in the microwave region and beyond require a lower dielectric constant, and higher operating temperatures are being specified for many applications. The need for higher density interconnection substrates is fueled by ever-shrinking consumer andtelecommunications products. Consumers are looking for products that are the absolute smallest, lightest weight, and feature rich in their class. The competition in these markets is fierce and the need is urgent.To address this critical need in both the military and commercial sectors, Foster-Miller proposes to demonstrate the extraordinary properties of a new class of electronic substrate materials known as liquid crystal polymers (LCPs). Foster-Miller has beendeveloping an electronic packaging technology based on these innovative LCPs for microwave multichip modules, advanced surface mount printed wiring boards and optoelectronic applications. Foster-Miller has recently commercialized a novel low-cost LCPmaterial for these advanced applications and the focus of this SBIR effort will be to help establish a commercial production facility for fabricating LCP-based PWBs.

Ahighly compact transmission design is also proposed which promisesa three times improvement in torque. Used alone or with thetransmission, the motor would provide unprecedented torque, powerand control bandwidth for the SWL as well as other motion controlapplications.

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Unedited Applicant's Abstract): The intrathoracic compliance            chamber (ICC) is the most successful solution to the variable volume problem of      a totally implantable pulsatile artificial heart. However, existing designs are      handicapped by the rate at which the gas permeates through the chamber               diaphragm given that all polymeric membranes are subject to some degree of gas       permeation. Given this limitation, percutaneous gas refills would be required        at frequent intervals, measured at best in weeks. It is Foster-Miller's              hypothesis that this limitation can be remedied by the use of liquid crystal         polymers (LCPs), a material of remarkable mechanical performance and extremely       low permeability.                                                                                                                                                         In the Phase I program, Foster-Miller demonstrated that LCPs have the                biocompatibility, low permeability, high fatigue resistance and sufficient           manufacturability to be ideal candidates for ventricular assist devices (VAD)        and total artificial heart (TAH) compliance chamber diaphragms. The proposed         Phase II program will demonstrate the long-term performance and stability of an      integrated compliance chamber system. Pilot manufacturing techniques will be         developed and components manufactured with these techniques will be evaluated        both in-vitro and in-vivo. The long-term objective of this project is to             design, develop, and qualify a compliance chamber system that can be integrated      with existing and future blood pumps to make truly implantable systems.              PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The primary market for the proposed product is represented by the 35,000 to 70,000  patients per year estimated by the Institutes of Medicine to require permanent ventricular  assist devices or total artificial hearts.  This market could be even larger when blood-  pumping systems are proven to be safe enough to use in more than the very sickest,  near-terminal patients.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         During the Phase I program, Foster-Miller developed techniques based on Ultrasonic Tape Lamination (UTL) for joining of plasticized PVC sewer pipe liner. This effort was undertaken in response to a need for environmentally sound and cost-effective methods for rehabilitation of aging water and sewerage pipe rehabilitation infrastructure. Ultrasonic lamination has several significant advantages over the hot air field welding process currently in use. These advantages include the highly focused nature of energy deposition during insonification, and the rapid generation of this localized heating through a combination of viscoelastic and frictional effects. Therefore, ultrasonic lamination allows rapid joining against the surface of a concrete sewer pipe that functions as a significant heat sink during conventional hot air welding. Foster-Miller is working with Ameron International, Branson, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDep) and the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) to demonstrate the use of ultrasonic lamination of liner materials. In Phase I, ultrasonic lamination of sewer liner material was demonstrated against a realistic substrate, and has been shown to provide welds that meet the strength goals established by Ameron with joining times more than an order of magnitude shorter than the current method. Based on these results, Foster-Miller, Branson, and Ameron propose to design and build a prototype field-deployable ultrasonic lamination system and demonstrate its use in the field for installation of PVC liner material. Many estimates put the required investment for sewer pipe replacement or rehabilitation in the hundreds of millions of dollars over the next decade. Beyond the pipe lining markets, Foster-Miller has identified a large number of potential ultrasonic lamination applications in both the aerospace and civil infrastructure industries. These markets include the fabrication of thick composite.",

In this effort, Foster-Miller proposes to use itscapabilities in polymer science and commercial machinery design and fabrication to develop pilot-scale processing equipment able to produce nanofiber membranes.  Published research indicates that such membranes are lightweight, have favorable water and airdiffusion characteristics, and can be made active during processing with various functional materials so they effectively self-decontaminate.  In Phase I, Foster-Miller designed and constructed a computer-controlled benchtop unit for more rapid laboratoryprocessing of nanofiber membranes.  In Phase II, this work will be extended to a pilot-scale facility capable of producing nanofiber membranes at sufficient rates and sizes for evaluation in soldier protection demonstration programs.  The proposed effortincludes process modeling, electrospinning evaluation, characterization and rate maximization using an improved benchtop system as well as prototype design, fabrication, assembly and proveout of a scale-up system.  Our commercial partner will assist intesting nanofiber membranes in stand-alone and multi-layer fabric configurations, paving the way for Phase III design of equipment for installation and use in producing enhanced high performance outdoor gear.

        "abstract": "Abstract         60821        Artificial lighting consumes about 20 percent of the U.S. energy production, and has rather low efficiencies (from less than 7 percent for the incandescent lamp to about 30 percent for the most efficient but high cost lamps).  Economical incandescent lamps with efficiencies of 30 percent or more would have a $1B+ annual market.  After successful development and implementation, such efficient lamps could increase U.S. energy savings by more than 10 percent.  This project will develop selective emitter based technology for incandescent lamps that are targeted to have 30 percent efficiency, 2000 hr life, and a cost comparable to halogen lamps.  Phase I specimens demonstrated selective emission in the visible range, thermal shock resistance, and phase stability at test temperature.  An innovative, mass-producible, and economical process to manufacture these components was proven, and a major U.S. corporation made a commitment to invest in the development of this lamp technology.  Phase II will optimize materials and processes and demonstrate repeatability in high lamp performance, life expectancy, and cost effectiveness.                     Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The primary application is in efficient lighting products for industrial, commercial, and residential applications.  Other applications include selective emitters for efficient paper drying and photovoltaic power generators; filters for erosive, corrosive and high temperature processes; and furnace igniters.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Future space science missions will deploy structures many hundreds of meters long to provide compression columns for solar sails, heat shields and low-cost power production. These structures must be ultra-lightweight, packaged efficiently and be reliable over many years of mission duration. Existing technology is too massive, unreliable, or imperfection sensitive to currently meet these requirements.Foster-Miller will develop a new type of self-deploying, lightweight compression column by fabricating grid works of flexible, high modulus material. This open, isogrid-like structure is essentially a truss where the members are individual fiber bundles. The structure folds extremely compactly by using the flexibility of the composite material to flatten completely without yielding. This open column provides an ultra-light weight structure with the traditional truss advantages; high efficiency, insensitivity to imperfections, and ease of performance prediction. All fabrication is performed on the ground where manufacturing processes can be carefully controlled to ensure peak performance. And, the deployment and stowage of the structure can be repeated many times, allowing the spacecraft system to be thoroughly tested prior to flight. The development of this technology will provide future mission designers with a new alternative with which to produce Gossamer structures and spacecraft.",

The purpose of the Phase I program was to develop an in-vehicle sensor to measure roadway surface conditions and, from these measurements, determine the coefficient of friction between the tire and the roadway.  Consequently, we developed an approach based on prior research efforts and simplified them by using newer technologies.  The physical basis of our system depends on the coefficient of friction and slip and is supported by a hardware suite that consists of an electro-optical sensor, highway pavement databases, GPS receiver, and a method to determine ground speed.  Applications for this pavement condition sensor include adaptive cruise control, safety systems for lateral/longitudinal crash avoidance and highway condition assessment for adverse weather treatment",

The tool will provide an automated means for determining the time and number of occurrences of a limited number of crew activities, including time spent in translation; human involvement will be minimal. Phase I objectives are to 1) select and prioritize the crew activities that CPA must analyze, 2) design and conduct a pilot test for proof of concept, and 3) determine necessary refinements to adapt the existing algorithms for the space environment.

This capability would enable the lower weight space systems and allow feedback control and diagnostics for many currently open loop thruster and thermal management systems.Foster-Miller believes that two-phase flow measurement of cryogenics will be demonstrated in this Phase I using our proprietary Dynamical Instrument method with radio frequency sensors. Our method measures the several non-linear, or chaotic, features of the flow and correlates that to calibration runs. The unique work proposed here is to use small, 0.25cm, radio antennas on the inside wall of the pipe. Radio waves have been tried by others but the inherent chaotic nature of two-phase flows has foiled these linear correlation attempts. With the antennas inside of the pipe, signal communications can be done with a radio link with no penetration of the pipe and minimal or no penetration of the surrounding cryogenic insulation jacket . Phase II should be able to reduce this to a practical instrument for flight demonstration. Flight opportunities are being developed through the Center for Space Power and the Commercial Space Center for Engineering.",

Several issues need to be addressed in orderto bring this technology to fruition, particularly  the ferromagnets used in these sources.  Following a successful Phase I and follow-on efforts using two separate approaches (i.e., surface modification of commercial ferrets and synthesis of ferritenanoparticles), we will develop in the proposed Phase II program materials based on these two approaches.  The goal is to satisfy certain requirements that have evolved as a result of the various developments in energy directed applications as well asother high frequency applications.  Namely, we plan to address the issue of faster magnetics that of high frequency filtering with enhanced performance.  Our efforts will focus on material optimization, characterization, core fabrication and testing indevices, as well as scale up and commercialization of the appropriate components, in collaboration with our partners.  This effort will establish a precedent for taking this technology further towards useful compact high power microwave devices.  Inaddition to directed energy weapons and magnetic switching, the novel ferromagnetic materials will prove useful in inductively coupled fuzing, permanent magnets in small motors, low-loss inductors for rechargeable consumer products, transformers, chokes,television e-beam deflection yokes in telecommunications, anechoic chambers, high density recording media and high frequency filters.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Survivability countermeasures against nuclear, EMI/EMP and radar/microwave radiation are needed, particularly with the strong dependence of US defense on more complex microcircuitries incorporated in the various military components.  Furthermore, theincreasing use of composites, which do not incorporate conductive elements, in electronic equipment, aerospace and other hardware requires radiation hardening.  In the absence of inadequate hardening, failure of commercial and military electronics couldresult due to, for example, changes in frequency characteristics of the various components such as capacitors, resistors and inductors.  Following a successful Phase I effort, we will develop in this Phase II program novel shielding materials thatencompass several materials with different electromagnetic properties at the particle level, which can be easily process in one layer into the desired shape.  The materials will be engineered for specific application in agreement with our industrial andmilitary partners, and will have the capability of absorption and dissipation of electromagnetic radiation throughout a wide frequency range.  Our efforts will be geared towards material  optimization through extensive testing so that it meets requirementsof potential end users.  Scale up efforts towards commercialization of the products will also be undertaken in this program in collaboration with our commercial partners.  Low cost, easily processable and multi-functional radiation hardening materials inone single layer, that are efficient in a wide range, will be beneficial to the shielding industry in a large number of military and commercial components. Aeronautic, telecommunications, surface-mount and electronic equipment are examples of potentialmarkets for the proposed technology.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The effluents of many industrial processes, as well as surface water and groundwater from historically polluted sites, often contain unacceptably high levels of Hg and other toxic trace metals. Although inorganic Hg itself is not bioaccumulative, it is readily converted to methyl mercury in the ambient environment, and so should be removed before discharge. The U.S. EPA has identified mercury-contaminated groundwater and surface water as areas of particular concern, and has emphasized development of innovative, robust extraction technologies for the current round of SBIR funding. Frontier's SBIR technology involves co-precipitation of the trace metal with a thiol-containing organic complexing agent (MCX), which is soluble as an alkali salt but instantly forms extremely insoluble complexes with many transition metals, particularly Hg, Ag, Cu, Cd, Zn, Pb, Fe, As(III), Se(IV), Co, and Ni. Thus, the reagent can be added to the aqueous sample in soluble form, and the complexed trace metals can be quickly filtered or removed by flocculation and settling of the resulting precipitate. The mercury salt of MCX is so insoluble that Frontier has used it as an analytical \"carrier\" for the co-precipitation and extraction of other metals of analytical interest.Phase I results demonstrated that MCX not only exhaustively complexes and precipitates most dissolved toxic trace metals of concern, including Ag, Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb, Se(IV), As(III), Zn, and Tl, but in most cases it also has the ability to strip them from indigenous, competitive metal-binding ligands such as EDTA. The MCX/metal complex is insoluble in aqueous phase, and therefore precipitates efficiently in solution. MCX complexes Hg >99.9 percent over the entire range from pH 1 to 12, and >99.999 percent across the limited, but quite common, range of pH 3 to 6. Satisfactory complexation and precipitation of the target metals of interest occurred very rapidly, with >99 percent of metal removal occurring within the first minute.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Phase II proposal and the recently completed Phase I project deal with a new process of production of glycerol from cornstarch by a yeast fermentation. There are two current industrial processes for glycerol. Chemical syntheses are no longer competitive. The second method involves recovering glycerol as a byproduct from soap and other fatty acid industries. It suffers from the decline of the main products and also the large and thus restrictive 7 to 1 main-products to byproduct ratio. The byproduct simply cannot grow much without upsetting the market supply-demand balance of the main-products. Phase I work has improved the glycerol fermentation to a peak productivity of 4-5 g/l/h and a high average productivity of 3 g/l/h. The work has also improved the final glycerol concentration in the fermented broth to over 330 g/l, reducing reactor volume and evaporation costs. The overall yield has reached a high value of 1g/2g of cornstarch. Another important character of the yeast is the fact that the cells are stable and active, leaving no residual glucose at the end of batch operations. This makes the downstream operation of vacuum distillation for purifying the final product easy to do, avoiding otherwise problems of charring of residual carbohydrates. These results have led to this proposed Phase II project which will evaluate various reactor systems, as well as high vacuum distillation for glycerol purification, employing industrial grade raw materials, over wide ranges of process variables and oxygen supply levels. This proposed Phase II study will obtain enough practical data to prepare for a future Phase III project.",

Although many compounds are designed for the         ability to exert a desired biological effect, few perform satisfactorily as          drugs due to unexpected modes of action in vivo. The investigators have              developed a battery of retrovirus-based technologies that allow for the              isolation of genes based on their function in tissue culture cells. The              investigators state that in the Phase I proposal they have taken advantage of        the inhibition of cellular proliferation by anti-hypertensive calcium channel        blockers to isolate gene products that are important to the action of these          drugs. They also state that preliminary studies have demonstrated the                feasibility of employing this approach on a large scale to identify gene             products involved in calcium physiology and cell proliferation control. In this      application they propose to carry out exhaustive screens for genes that confer       resistance to dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers from diverse tissue           types, to categorize these gene products with respect to mechanism of drug           resistance, and to identify relevant drug targets among them.

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program investigates a novel software tool for integrating multiple 3D images. Three-dimensional (3D) modeling of physical objects and environment is an essential part of the challenges for many multimedia tasks. However, most physical objects self occlude, and no single view 3D image suffices to describe the entire surface of a 3D object. Multiple 3D images of the same object or scene from various viewpoints have to be taken and integrated in order to obtain a complete 3D model of the 3D object or scene. This process is called the \"3D mosaic\". The primary objective of this SBIR effort is to develop a fully automatic and intelligent software tool that is able to mosaic (i.e., align and merge) multiple 3D images of the same object taken from different viewpoints, without a priori knowledge of camera positions. The main innovations of this proposed effort are threefold: (1) an intelligent alignment method that is able to register multiple un-calibrated 3D images without needing any priori knowledge of camera location and orientation; (2) a seamless merge method to \"stitch\" together the aligned 3D images using the fuzzy logic principle; and (3) an intelligent 3D image compression algorithm that preserves 3D image geometric features while achieving high compression ratio. The 3D Mosaic technique to be developed under this SBIR program has enormous commercial applications, including industrial design and prototyping, reverse engineering, manufacturing part inspection, part replacement and repair, animation, entertainment, 3D modeling for WWW documents, archiving, virtual reality environment, education, virtual museum, commercial on-line catalogues, etc. It will become an important part of future 3D TV technology",

In our Phase I effort, we have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the OMIR concept.  Specifically, our accomplishments include: (a) We have design, built and tested an OMIR prototype that employs a low-cost IR sensor and our customdesigned OMNI-Mirror.  The prototype hardware allows us for acquiring 360-degree IR images at a video rate (30 frames per second). (b) We have developed sophisticated algorithms and software to convert the omnidirectional images into panoramic andperspective images.  The software also offers the motion detection, objective detection, and alarm/recording capabilities that are critical for near-vehicle situation awareness applications (c) After we have demonstrated the feasibility of the basic OMIRmodel, we went further to investigate a new scheme to increase the resolution of IR sensor, based on a novel concept of",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The proposed investigation focuses on the research and development of a fundamentally new, high-speed, radio-frequency (RF) switch. It is designed for frequencies in the range 1-100 GHz. The switch is predicted on thin-film microelectromechanical systems(MEMS) technology with piezoelectric actuation. In general, piezoelectric materials develop strain when an electric field is present, which allows mechanical expansion and contraction of the material to be controlled by an applied voltage. Unliketraditional electrostatic MEMS switches, the closing force between the metal-to-metal contacts can be significantly improved by increasing the bias voltage (electric field strength) across the piezoelectric material. Because the switch restoring force islarge, in-use stiction is greatly mitigated with this architecture. The piezoelectric material lead zirconate titanate (PZT) is used as an actuator in the current project. This makes new mechanical designs feasible. Three strategies are suggested forlowering the switch time constant into the tens of nanoseconds range while preserving other important characteristics of the switch (e.g. high isolation, low resistive losses). These include a bimorph design, piezoelectric extensional bars, andflextensional actuators. Combinations of these strategies are likely to yield a high-performance switch.",

The proposed sensor will be insensitive to membrane fouling and hydrodynamic effects, providing accurate measurements without recalibration. The oxygen detection method will use a novel mode of sensing that is insensitive to fluid flow and membrane fouling. By using a CO2 sensing scheme that involves chemisorbing a reduced-CO2 species on a platinum electrode and then stripping by anodically ramping, we can measure CO2 using the same working electrode or a second working electrode within the same sensor. Signal will be linearly related to pCO2, rather than logarithmically related as in conventional (Severinghaus) CO2 detection, leading to greater accuracy. A periodic, steady-state oxygen measurement will indicate the extent of fouling and a correlation will be developed to correct the CO2 measurement.

        "abstract": "Abstract         This project is intended to demonstrate the prognostic enhancements to diagnostic systems.  It adopts a systematic methodology to select and assess prognostic and human-system interface concepts and suggests means to integrate them into existing shipboardCondition Based Maintenance systems.  Phase I effort resulted in the development of prognostic algorithms with a dynamic wavelet neural network and a virtual sensor comprising the main modules of the prognosticator architecture.  Means to represent andmanage uncertainty in the prediction scheme and a techno-economic assessment methodology were conceptualized in Phase I.  Finally, an open system interface platform and a simple human interface were designed for the prognostic system.  The prognosticsystem was tested successfully under simulation conditions on pump and injector nozzle failures.  Phase II activities will focus on the optimization of the prognostic algorithms, design of interfacing requirements and test/evaluation of the prognosticarchitecture on two shipboard systems: a motor-pump combination and a gas turbine.  An integrated stand-alone diagnostic/prognostic system will be developed, tested and evaluated to function as an experimental prototype for productization andcommercialization purposes.Dual use applications of this novel health management technology are envisioned to maximize equipment uptime and improve the reliability and availability of critical military and industrial processes.The project team alsoincludes integrators, developers and users of this technology to transition this into many commercial and defense related Phase III applications.",

Through a combination of modeling and field data collection, we will develop an expert system for the optimization of mussel raft aquaculture. In Phase II, we will perform additional field work tuning our model to include waves, raft mooring requirements, predator nets and provide output not only as mean flow through the rafts but also simulations of food particles (seston) and mussel biomass in relation to farm site selection, mussel raft design and orientation, and seeding density. The integration of oceanographic and biological models into a single PC platform will allow for convenient prediction of optimal farm site locations, necessary and cost-effective mooring requirements, appropriate mussel raft management scenarios and predicted yields. In addition to developing an expert system, we will provide a complete design guide for mussel rafts building on the results using FLOW-3D in Phase I, and covering a range of current speeds, seston concentration and wave heights to be expected in Maine and U.S. coastal waters.",

The innovation is based on the utilization of micromechanical-system(MEMS) of high figures of merits and Si monolithic integration compatibility.  The proposed simple MEMS photon detector structure allows both electrical and optical read-out design.  Optical read-out is an attractive alternative to uncooled IR imagers,which potentially eliminates the major drawback of electronic means that inevitably introduce additional thermal loss to the signal due to the contact made to the detector element.  Based on a Phase I feasibility demonstration, we propose to furtherdevelop this new technology realizing commercial products.  The proposed Phase II work is in collaboration with Rockwell Science Center, a leading IR imager producer, and with VC matching funding.  Success in the Phase II effort will indentify a viablemanufacturing route for advanced uncooled IR imaging array fabrication.  These devices have a wide range of",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project involves the development of a catalyst to control NOx emissions from combined cycle power plants using natural gas fired turbines (natural gas fired power plants). During the Phase I effort, Guild Associates developed an environmental catalyst for the control of NOx emissions using NH3. Operating in the presence of excess (about 20-33%) NH3, the catalyst was able to achieve greater than 95% NOx reduction without NH3 slip. NH3 slip is avoided because the catalyst is able to simultaneously reduce the excess NH3 to N2 and H2O. The objective of this project is to modify the catalyst developed during the Phase I effort in order to enhance its commercial viability. Enhancing the commercial viability will involve increasing the reactivity of the catalyst and eliminating platinum metals from the formulation. Enhancing the reactivity will allow the catalyst to operate at higher space velocities. Eliminating platinum metals from the formulation will greatly reduce the cost of the catalyst. Successful completion of this effort will result in a simple, low cost technology for control of NOx emissions from natural gas fired power plants without NH3 slip. Potential Commercial Applications include the control of NOx emissions from natural gas fired power plants. Other commercial applications include controlling NOx emissions from semiconductor manufacturing, fine and specialty chemical manufacturing and nitric acid manufacturing processes.",

Each year,      approximately 500 million people become infected and more than 2 million die.        There is a great need to control the spread of this disease. One of the main         focuses of malaria vaccine development has been the on use of recombinant            proteins derived from the various developmental stages of the parasite. The          goal of the proposed research is to produce highly immunogenic recombinant           subunits that can be formulated with clinically relevant adjuvants in an effort      to advance candidate vaccine antigens from preclinical status to clinical            status. Phase I research demonstrated that the MSP-1 p42 antigen is expressed        at high levels in the Drosophila cell expression system. The expressed antigen       has been demonstrated to have relevant antigenic and immunogenic properties          associated with native structure. Phase II research will further characterize        the immunogenic properties of the abundantly expressed p42. The ability of the       p42 antigen to provide a protective response in monkeys when formulated with         clinically relevant antigens will be tested. The success of the proposed             research would result in a product that could then be tested in humans.              PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Malaria poses a significant world-wide health threat. Currently, there is no vaccine for malaria. The proposed research will test the efficacy of a malaria vaccine candidate protein subunits to elicit protective responses in Aotus monkeys when formulated with clinically relevant adjuvants. The ability of this antigen to provide a protective response when formulated with one or more clinically relevant adjuvant would contribute to the development of a safe, efficacious and cost effective malaria vaccine.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (adapted from applicant's abstract): Pathogenic organisms are            believed to be responsible for a number of infections, neurodegenerative and as      well as some types of neuropsychiatric diseases. Detection of neuroactive            pathogens, at the earliest stages, would be a critical factor in the diagnosis       and treatment of any possible neuropathological consequences. Enzyme-linked          immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are already          being used separately as specific microbial detection methods. In the present        project, we propose to develop a technology of pathogen detection, which             combines the advantages of ELISA and those of PCR. This is expected to result        in a highly efficient, reproducible method for the detection of very small           numbers of pathogens, even before they can elicit the normal host immune             response. The project will be carried out in two phases. In phase 1, the method      of immuno-PCR will be standardized by measuring proteins and peptides that have      special importance in brain function or pathology. This will be done using           either brain cells where they are specifically and abundantly expressed, or in       heterologous cells, such as lymphocytes, where they are expressed at very low        levels, by a phenomenon known as \"'illegitimate transcription\". In phase 2 we        will extend the protocols developed in phase 1 to detect and quantitatively          measure some of the pathogens that are commonly found in human populations and       which are of great concern to public health authorities. Four different              approaches to immuno-PCR will be compared, based (a) on electrophoresis and          ethidium bromide staining of the amplified DNA and densitometry of the band          obtained: (b) measurement of fluorescence produced following reaction of the         PCR mixture with the dye, PicoGreen; colorimetry following reaction of               chromogenic substrate with digoxigenin-alkaline phosphate ligated to DNA; and        (d) fluorometry of the complex produced by the action of a fluorescent               substance (AttoPhos) on the DNA-digoxigenin complex.                                 PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  (a) Development of rapid and highly sensitive, early detection kits for neuropathogens in  human and animal tissues and body fluids; (b) Evaluation of the efficiency of vaccines,  commonly used in persons at risk for infection; (c) Evaluation of the immune reaction  subsequent to primary infection or immunization, and (d) possible identification and   treatment of microorganisms responsible for idiopathic neuropathogenesis.",

This Phase II SBIR project will result in companion multimedia programs (Sun Safe Central and Adventures with the Shady Characters) in both English and Spanish, targeting home-based child-care providers and the preschool children in their care.  The programs will provide Web-based sun protection information and interactive tools for the providers, and a CD-ROM with sun protection games, songs and other activities for children 3-5 years old.  In Phase II, we will produce the remaining information, tools and graphic elements to include:  1) expanding the scope of information for providers; 2) adding tools to help providers integrate sun protection policies and practices into their daily routine, and 3) teaching children age-appropriate sun protection behaviors through fun-filled activities.  A two-group randomized field test will assess the programs' effectiveness at changing providers' and children's knowledge and practices, as well as providers' self-efficacy regarding implementing sun protection policies and practices for their child-care business.

This Phase II SBIR will result in a multimedia CD-ROM, Coming Out Ahead(Tm), that will help women make informed breast cancer treatment decisions. The product will focus on the personal aspects of the treatment, giving women an opportunity to consider non-medical needs during the treatment period, to learn how a suggested treatment will impact their lives, and to learn ways to manage these impacts. In Phase II, we will research and produce remaining informational content and graphic elements and concurrently identify and develop additional decision-support tools for the CD-ROM. The complete decision- support system will included information about breast cancer, its treatments, and the impact of those treatments, as well as tools for more effective information processing, patient-provider communication, treatment-related problem-solving, and clarification of treatment- related preferences and values. Product effectiveness in increasing women's confidence about their treatment decision will be field tested with recently diagnosed women with early-stage breast cancer.

The overall objective is an environmentally friendly replacement for radiolumenescent lamps used in fire control instruments.  Hi-Z will continueexploratory development of power sources for illumination that utilize thermoelectric direct heat to electric conversion.  A design optimization will be conducted focusing on a 1 to 2 watt thermoelectric generator fueled by military logistics fuel (dieselor jet fuel).  For the heat source we take advantage of another innovative technology being developed under separate Army SBIR.  This is the Low Cost Pocket Stove utilizing the Porous Surface Element wick.  Prototype generators will be fabricated, testedand delivered.  Technologies and hardware will be identified to support fabrication in Phase III.  In addition, similar generators at lower and higher power output will be built and demonstrated.  Lower power (100 to 300 MW) suits replacement of individualradio luminescent lamps, but at this size butane fuel is necessary.  At higher power (to 30 W), the generator can also serve as a battery charger power supply.  Throughout the range of output power to be considered, the generator concept fits variousmilitary power requirements that are presently met with chemical batteries (primary or rechargeable).  Further work will continue to research the alternative possibilities of tritium and molten salt heat sources.",

A new high-performance, low cost, small size silicon chip antenna, fabricated by wafer batch processing, will be combined with a standard, passive (no battery) RFID chip to form a low cost, high-performance RFID tag of small dimensions. The antenna and the RFID chip are stacked directly on top of each other. Phase I used a simplified process and scaled up structures. In Phase II the process will be optimized, devices with the intended dimensions will be used, and the antenna chip and the RFID chip will be stacked. Passive RFID systems are used in applications such as object tagging, asset management, hazardous materials tracking, and tracking of important documents. Existing RFID technology is limited by the need for large transponder antennas (~ 1 inch by 2 inch minimum) and costly multi-component assembly. The silicon wafer batch processed antenna chip technology will produce millimeter-scale smart tags (programmable replacement for bar codes), enabling products for large commercial markets.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A new type of planetary body sample acquisition tool called a Comet Nucleus Surface Sampler is proposed for development. The initial proposed use of this innovation is for comet surface sampling but the system can be applied to asteroids and Mars too. This invention allows for direct sampling of a comet nucleus surface employing a touch and go spacecraft. By avoiding a landing, the in situ study of comets is greatly simplified. It is only necessary for the sampling craft to make momentary contact with the surface via the sampler. Cutting heads located on a flexible boom 1.5 meters below the lander, counter rotate at high speed. When these heads contact the surface, small fragments are thrown up to the lander and into the apertures of instrumentation such as those under development at NASA Ames, GSFC and LaRC. The goals of the effort are to design a first iteration of the proposed sampler in an actual comet sampling situation, to fabricate a breadboard of the cutting head assembly and test this assembly at different attack angles in comet simulants cooled to cryogenic temperatures. Honeybee Robotics expects the research will enable low cost Discovery or Micromission class surface sampling missions.",

Insect, moisture, and temperature data will be sent to a Stored Grain Advisor (SGA) computer at GMPRC. SGA helps storage managers, processing personnel, and farmers limit the loss of stored grain to insect pests, molds, and fungus and projects insect population growth to recommend the best times to aerate or fumigate. Kansas State University will assist with data analysis and communications. Stainless-steel cables support small, low-cost, insect and moisture/temperature sensors packaged in streamlined cylindrical modules. Flexible circuits with miniature, surface-mount components allow the cable to pass through the sensor modules. Cables are fabricated in standard lengths to allow segments to be linked to accommodate silos and storage bins of different heights. AGIS will be evaluated in terms of performance, total cost, cost of ownership, and reliability. Individual insect and moisture/temperature sensors and electronics will also be provided to GMPRC, KSU, and NCPA to support related research.",

Recent powder metallurgy work in Japan has shown very high Jc results at high fields.  This project will combine a Nb-Sn-Ta powder metallurgy approach (to achieve high current densities), with a continuous tube forming and filling process (to achieve a low manufacturing cost for the superconductor).  Phase I demonstrated Nb-Sn-Ta mechanical alloyed powders with satisfactory Jc levels.  The powder metallurgy wire was made in lengths of 50-100 meters.  Also, issues with making multifilamentary wire were explored.  Phase II will focus on increasing the Jc level and increasing the filament count for multifilamentary wires.  Three variations of making long length (300-1000 meters) Nb-Sn-Ta superconducting wires will be investigated.                      Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The largest market will be for accelerator and fusion magnets.

In particular, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) tools, capable of predicting the flow behavior of conducting liquids in complex geometry with free surfaces in the presence of an intense heat flux and a magnetic field, will be developed and validated.  Applications to fusion liquid wall power extraction systems and commercial metallurgical processes will be the focus of the investigation.  In Phase I, two flagship codes based upon leading numerical schemes for the finite volume solution to free surface problems with MHD were developed in two dimensions with preliminary three dimensional (3-D) extensions.  Favorable physical validations, extensions to high density ratios, free surface-MHD interactions, and the use of adaptive gridding were demonstrated and critical numerical issues were identified.  In Phase II, accurate numerical models for incompressible free surface flows, with turbulence, scalar transport and MHD in 3-D, will be added and applied to issues in fusion systems.  Grid adaption, implicit schemes, modem boundary condition procedures, and coupled fluid-solid MHD solvers will be integrated with friendly user interfaces and CAD modeling computer programs.                      Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The primary beneficiary of this research will be the fusion community, where the need for such a tool for liquid wall reactor concepts has been identified.  Metallurgical companies also should have a strong need for such a tool (for MHD enhanced steel and aluminum casting), due to a lack of an integrated MHD capability in commercial fluid codes.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Carbon fiber reinforced silicon carbide (C/SiC) composites produced by chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) are actively being developed for a variety of high-temperature aerospace applications. Although CVI-based C/SiC composites are a promising class of materials for structural applications demanding high strength and toughness at temperatures to 1650 C, these materials are vulnerable to severe strength degradation when exposed to oxidizing environments above 425 C for prolonged periods. This limitation is due to the inherent process-induced matrix microcracks resulting from the large thermal expansion mismatch between the fiber and the matrix. These matrix cracks enable rapid intrusion of the environment which accelerates the degradation of the compliant fiber coating and/or reinforcing fiber, thus limiting the useful life of the component. The objective of this Phase I program is to investigate the feasibility of an oxidation- resistant C/SiC utilizing both fiber-level and molecularly-integrated matrix-level oxidation inhibition technology. Laminated C/SiC plates will be fabricated incorporating a duplex fiber coating system consisting of a 0.4 m pyrolytic carbon (PyC) layer to promote strength and toughness, followed by a boron carbide (B4C) oxidation-barrier layer, and densified with a 10 v/o boron-enriched silicon carbide inhibited matrix produced by CVI co- deposition. Test samples will be prepared and experimentally evaluated in high- temperature static stressed oxidation environments. Results will be compared to baseline conventionally-processed C/SiC composites to establish the viability of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Next generation aircraft braking materials need to improve the minimum dynamic friction coefficient and volumetric heat capacity as compared with state-of-the-art carbon/carbon braking materials.  These improvements will allow more compact, lighter weightbraking systems to be developed for future aircraft.  Additionally greater wear resistance is required to reduce the life cycle costs of the brake material.  Ceramic matrix composites potentially address these needs.  In particular a carbon fiberreinforced boron carbide matrix composite has been demonstrated to possess desirable thermal, mechanical and tribological behavior.The Phase I program fabricated carbon fiber reinforced boron carbide composites via chemical vapor infiltration (CVI). The resulting ceramic matrix composite exceeded the preliminary estimates of volumetric heat capacity as well as meeting targetedobjectives for other thermal and mechanical properties.  The Phase II program will optimize the fabrication process of these materials as well as produce and test a full-scale military brake replacement.  The resulting material properties and test resultswill be critically examined in collaboration with an industry consortium of brake system manufacturers.",

This project will develop a novel ion sensor array for field deployment in monitoring important contaminants and also for use in concert with remediation efforts.  The sensor array will provide real-time levels of metals at DOE sites and other areas of environmental concern.  Phase I created ion selective electrodes for four contaminants of concern (uranium, strontium, thorium, lead, and cesium) and optimized them for maximal sensitivity to each ion.  Selectivity was determined by flow injection analysis and tested spiked samples of groundwater.  In Phase II, the array will be integrated with microfluidics, microprocessors, and microvolume ion chromatography to allow unattended, remote analysis at selected DOE sites.  Electrodes will be used as detectors following chromatographic separation, thereby allowing two-point verification of each metal ion.  A compact computer controlled fluidic and sample handling system will be built, and software will be developed for automatic sample collection, fluid handling, and metal ion concentration determination.   The instrument will be tested at a DOE site and its results compared with those obtained using conventional analytical techniques.                  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: Initiatives by DOE, EPA, DoD and other federal and state agencies, along with the concerns of private industry and private citizens, require monitoring and remediation of hazardous contaminants.  The sensor technology should have commercial application in testing existing sites, monitoring remediation and testing industrial effluents.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The antibacterial drug thiostrepton binds to the L11 binding site of the 23S rRNA in bacterial ribosomes and prevents protein synthesis, yet is clinically unattractive due to poor pharmacokinetic properties. We have discovered in our Phase I work a number of compounds that work by a mechanism similar to that of thiostrepton. The related structural features of these compounds suggest that a compelling structure--   activity relationship (SAR) pattern can be uncovered by a directed analog synthesis effort. The Phase II grant proposes to prepare a large number of analogs of the previously discovered compounds for evaluation in a direct RNA binding assay, a cell-free translation assays, and MIC assays. The SAR of each series will then be analyzed using an automated analysis method, and a pharmacophore model will be constructed. This model will be used to predict a second generation series of compounds to prepare in order to maximize antibacterial activity. Compounds meeting the appropriate criteria for activity will be evaluated in animal models. This process will yield broad spectrum antibacterial agents unlikely to be affected by current drug resistance mechanisms, which will be exceedingly useful to the clinical market.   PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The development of disease-causing microorganisms resistant to many, if not all, of the currently available antimicrobial compounds has made it necessary to develop new classes of drugs. The discovery, in the Phase I portion of this work, of novel compounds acting against a proven, but clinically unused, drug target provides the opportunity to create a broad spectrum drug useful against a variety of clinical indications including drug resistant microorganisms.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Fibre Channel(FC) is a high-bandwidth, high-performance network technology which is gaining market momentum in both commercial and military arenas.  For routing topology flexibility, today's system area networks require switches.  To date, however, the FCtechnology has not been developed to efficiently support real-time quality of service (i.e., guaranteed bandwidth and latency) in a switched environment.  Such real-time quality of service is needed to meet future commercial and military requirements.  InPhase 1, we determined that virtual circuits would meet our goal of developing a real-time FC switch.  We further specified the architecture and protocol necessary to implement switch FC virtual circuits.  For Phase 2, with a combination of FasTrack andSBIR funds, we propose to build a 4x4 prototype FC virtual circuitry real-time quality of service switch.  The tasks will be comprised of completing the engineering and protocol design specifications, keeping the FasTrack-funded and SBIR-funded taskssynchronized, developing the prototype switch hardware and firmware components, integrating the prototype switch components, testing and debugging the prototype switch, and conducting a final demonstration of the prototype switch.  The prototype will bedesigned such that it can be moved into an ASIC implementation during the post-Phase 2 activities.  Fibre Channel was a $1+ billion industry in 1999.  Estimates are that by 2010 Fibre Channel will be a $10-20 billion industry.  Applications that can makeuse of a real-time quality of service switch include system/storage area networks, tape/disk jukeboxes, video broadcasters, videoconferencing, real-time systems(avionics, data acquisitions, etc.), e-commerce transactions, and interactive databases(airline/hotel/car reservations,. credit card processing, banking, etc.).

        "abstract": "Abstract         This proposal centers on developing an improved finite element analysis for composite structures that will allow Navy designers to more accurately predict structural failure than is currently possible.  Improved failure prediction capabilities will removea large part of the uncertainty associated with using advanced composite materials and hence facilitate more composite materials into Navy fleet use.  Benefits of increased use of composite structures include reduced costs, lower weights, and reducedelectromagnetic signatures.The analysis approach is a microstructural based theory and associated numerical algorithm for extracting, virtually without a time penalty, the continuum stress and strain fields for the constituents (matrix and reinforcement) of a composite in the courseof a routine structural finite element analysis.  Failure criteria are then applied at the constituent level.  Critical components of the analysis include the ability to handle woven fabric composites exhibiting rate and temperature dependent materialbehavior.The finite element implementation of this theory is referred to as Multicontinuum Theory (MCT) which reflects the coexisting continua within a typical composite material.  MCT is an enabling technology that provides the designer with a window into thestress/strain behavior of a composite structure at its most basic level, i.e., the individual constituents.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project proposes the construction of a miniature object recognition and color segmentation system on a chip. This chip will be tuned to recognize various predefined targets in natural environments. The chip will use an object recognition model, color histogramming, originally derived from research in cognitive neuroscience. Taking advantage of recent advances in Neuromorphic Engineering, the company will implement the basic sensing and computational elements directly in silicon using mixed analog/digital processing. In contrast, implementing the same model or algorithm with conventional microprocessor technology would require that the basic computations be simulated as an intermediate step. The removal of this intermediate step will result in an intelligent sensor with dramatically lower cost, smaller volume, and reduced power usage-achievements not possible using competing microprocessor-based technology. The applications for this technology include intelligent toys and prosthetic devices. A toy might be made to recognize, and therefore be able to respond to, the presence of another toy or specially designed environment. More advanced and elaborated versions of the chip might be used as an aid to the blind by assisting them in finding standardized (i.e. specially colored) objects. For example, a blind person might be assisted in localizing a coffee mug, distinguishing between two similar items of clothing differing only in color, or finding a standardized 'EXIT' sign in a building. The broader impact of this technology is that it will help bridge the gap between the natural, unstructured environment and computing technology.",

The technology is based on arrays of beads           assembled in the ends of fiber optic bundles.  The individual beads carry            nucleic acid probes.  The arrays can attain extremely high packing densities,        approximately 1,000 times that of conventional microarrays, and therefore have       very high information content.  This proposal's specific aims relate to              scaling up the technology developed during Phase I into a practical, cost-           effective tool for measuring RNA transcript levels.  The aims are to increase        very substantially the number of unique probes that can be represented on a          randomly addressed fiber optic microarray; to use this capacity to develop           arrays for comprehensive analysis of gene expression in mouse; and to test the       array system side-by-side with conventional array technology.  The highly            miniaturized, high-capacity arrays are expected to be a cost-effective tool          for expression analysis of the mouse genome.  The methods and technology will        be applicable to the rapid development of arrays for gene expression analysis        of other organisms.

The toolkit will build, edit and maintain a base of codified semanticinformation models, distributed over networks, by using Web-based semantic modeling capabilities like RDF/Schema and other XML-based technologies. Using userSMARTs, database and warehouse administrators will be able to map data elements in source andtarget schemas to these distributed semantic information models. This will then provide the semantic-richness necessary for flexible distributed queries, schema integration, automated data translation, and enhanced application support, especially in theareas of personalization and business process sharing. The objectives of this Phase II project are to: develop an alpha version of userSMARTs, promote the advancement of industry standards for semantic capabilities, and finally, to demonstrate thefeasibility of this technology for Army/DOD geospatial applications, and for civilian and commercial Web applications.",

Underlying IME's all-metal electronics is the transpinnor, a novel device that shows amplification and either logic or linear characteristics. IME has designed and fabricated several transpinnor-based logic gates and simple linear circuits, which are being tested. The Phase 1 project objectives are to demonstrate all-metal GMR electronics for selection, amplification and logic in an all-metal magnetic RAM. A mask set will be designed and made for the required support circuitry,which will then be fabricated and tested. The proposed Phase 1 project will enable a nonvolatile, rad hard, all-metal (no semiconductors) RAM with nondestructive readout and fabricated in a single process. In a GMR RAM with semiconductor support electronics, the support circuitry and memory array are manufactured in separate processes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Not Available This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will result in the development of a prototype flywheel energy storage system (FESS) utilizing the innovative passive, non-contacting bearing developed in the Phase I project. This new type of passive magnetic support and damping (PMSD) system consists of integrated stiffness and damping elements in a configuration that overcomes the most significant problems of previous systems. The new bearing technology will result in a more efficient, more reliable, and less expensive FESS than is currently available. The resulting FESS will facilitate the use of alternative energy systems in remote and/or hostile environments. Phase II efforts will focus on 2 objectives: (1) The refinement and experimental validation of design equations predictive of PMSD performance; and (2) The development, installation, and testing of PMSD systems in a prototype FESS. The FESS system for the prototype will be a commercial unit provided by the commercialization partner, and modified to accommodate the new technology. The partner currently manufactures FESS for commercial power quality and uninterruptible power supplies applications. Follow-on funding commitments and other agreements have been secured from the Alaska Science and Technology Foundation and from the commercialization partner to pursue additional technical work and for Phase III commercialization. In addition to providing storage for alternative energy systems, there are numerous commercial applications for FESS incorporating the PMSD technology including utility load leveling and uninterruptible power supplies (UPS). The commercialization partner expects that the combination of technical and cost advantages demonstrated in Phase I would enable rapid market acceptance and encourage application of FESS in new markets. The PMSD technology is also applicable to turbo-molecular pumps (TMPs). These are used in the manufacture of silicon chips and in scientific instrumentation requiring high vacuums. Predicted market penetration into these areas is in excess of 18,000 units per year by 2005 and in excess of 30,000 units per year by 2009",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will build on Phase I results to take advantage of an exciting opportunity to revolutionize the way people interact with the machines they encounter in everyday life. Visual displays have progressed remarkably in past decades. Aircraft cockpits that used to have hundreds of gauges and dials now have just a few color displays that provide rich visual information that changes depending on the situation. Yet physical interfaces--knobs, buttons, sliders, etc.--remain as primitive as ever. Regardless of context, these interfaces always feel the same and can serve only a limited number of functions. Phase I results demonstrated the potential human factors benefits of Smart Instrument Controls with programmable feels-- operator performance improved, especially when visual attention was critical, such as during a driving simulation task. These systems also could simplify interfaces by reducing the number of separate controls. One control could operate several functions, each function having a distinctly separate \"feel\". Phase II will continue human factors studies and expand to include research into novel sensor and actuator technologies for Smart Instrument Controls in order to develop a technology that simplifies elaborate system interfaces while improving or maintaining operator performance. Immersion Corporation proffers a man-machine interface technology that enhances an operator's experience and in many cases can improve performance by leveraging the underutilized sense of touch. These benefits have attracted companies",

Immunicon has developed a sensitive test for              detecting tumor cells in peripheral blood.  This test uses ferrofluids and           magnetic separation technology for tumor cell enrichment and multidimensional        flow cytometry for cell analysis.  Clinical data show that tumor cells exist         in the blood of breast cancer patients.  One limitation of  this test is that        flow cytometry does not confirm the identity of the events that are detected.        Morphologic features of cells of immunophenotypically identified events can          improve the specificity of the test.  These features can be obtained using           multicolor fluorescent microscopy.   The quantity of ferrofluid used to              capture tumor cells from  blood, however, can obscure the cell.  Phase I             feasibility data show that proposed new  methods helped to decrease ferrofluid       without sacrificing the sensitivity of the test and the proposed objectives          were achieved.  Feasibility data also shows that incorporating these methods         into new assay procedures permits microscopy analysis - a significant                breakthrough.  The aim of this Phase II proposal is to adapt these new               procedures which incorporate the Phase I developments to further develop and         validate the test to detect cancer cells present in blood using multi color          fluorescent microscopy.

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a disease        with high mortality in both developed and developing countries. The causative        agents are the parasites Leishmania chagasi, donovani and infantum depending on      geographic location. In Mediterranean countries, co-infection with HIV has           become problematic and asymptomatic individuals have been shown to transmit the      parasite through transfusion, in both France and Brazil. The reservoir for VL        is dogs and recently U.S. foxhounds have succumbed to VL raising veterinary          concerns. Tests available for early diagnosis have benefited by using the            recombinant K39 antigen that is specific for active disease, but does not            adequately detect asymptomatic infections. In Phase I improved diagnosis (dogs/      humans) was obtained by using K39 in combination with another recombinant            antigen K26.                                                                                                                                                              The studies proposed here are to take advantage of this enhanced detection in a      combination test for VL that would have human and veterinary applications.           These studies will exploit the expertise of InBios to develop FDA approved           rapid tests using a combination of Corixa Corp's K39 and K26 antigens. The           studies will also benefit from a close collaboration with researchers at CDC         and WRAIR and renowned consultants domestically and in developing countries and      by access to their human and canine serum banks.                                     PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:   The proposed studies will lead to the commercialization of diagnostic tests that will aid in the  early diagnosis of active and asymptomatic infections with the parasites L.donovani, chagasi,  and infantum.  Such test would have application in the human and veterinary fields.  The  worldwide market for such a test is estimated to be in excess of $10-15 million dollars based  on a cost of $1.50 per test.",

The Academy states that 80% of the cumulative damage to the skin takes place by age 18. Despite this alarming situation, young people in America, believing that skin color from the sun is healthy, sexy and cool, are not covering up or coming in from the sun.  This project plans to produce and field test 4 video based educational interventions which dramatize the risks of solar overexposure and age-appropriate protective techniques.  The Phase II testing will include a pre- post- test format.  After the summer following the initial testing, a longitudinal study will be conducted to assess the sustainable pro-heath effects of the intervention.  Innovation include:  high-interest, high-impact video-based dramatizations that are culturally sensitive and age-appropriate, dealing with vital skin cancer issues for which very few other products exist; creation of skin cancer testing instruments for various age levels.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The problems in sleep disorder medicine caused by the cost, access and variety of sleep laboratory testing have led to increasing use of home testing with oximeters for screening and triage of patients with suspected sleep apnea. Current oximeters are designed for hospital use and not for sleep medicine. They are complex and difficult to use for unattended recordings. They process the signal to reduce movement artifacts thereby reducing accuracy for apneas. This project will develop a new fully ambulatory oximeter (OxiTrac) designed for unattended recording in the home for two or more consecutive nights. OxiTrac will be worn like a wristwatch with a short cable connecting to a finger probe. Activity monitoring will be fully integrated into the unit for direct artifact detection reducing errors introduced by the amount of signal processing in current oximeters. Heart rate, SaO2, and activity will be stored in the unit and later downloaded to a computer for display and automatic analyses. In phase I the OxiTrac prototype was developed and successfully used, establishing feasibility. In phase II the unit will be improved, automatic artifact detection and data analyses developed and clinical evaluation completed. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The prevalence of the sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) is estimated at between 4 to 8% of the population. The high consequences of this disease and the cost of polysomnography make simplified recording techniques for screening and diagnosing imperative. Pulse oximetry has become a primary measure of choice in the evaluation of SAS and other sleep-related breathing disorders. The OxiTrac unit if established as a standard, would be suitable for use by the specialist, family doctor, nurse and most clinical staff and sold to virtually all sleep disorder centers, researchers, physicians, home testing agencies and similar clinical environments.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes development of        MedMate, a unique adherence enhancement system designed especially for patients      on HIV/AIDS medication. While newly developed protease inhibitors significantly      reduce viral loads, these medicines require high levels of adherence with            exceedingly complex regimens. Non-adherent patients risk developing resistant        HIV strains. The MedMate system will utilize advanced computer and                   communication technologies to produce a handheld comprehensive, user-friendly        product for HIV/AIDS patients to help them cope with taking these medicines.         The MedMate system will also have enormous value as a research tool. Based on        the empirical literature, MedMate will contain educational, affective, and           behavioral components designed to enhance adherence. MedMate helps plan a safe,      optimized regimen tailored to the patient's lifestyle, serves as a patient           reminder system, addresses problems of missed medications, changes in                schedules/time zones, etc., monitors severity of side effects, and permits           customized adherence feedback. Phase I was successfully completed. Phase II          will see the final production of MedMate components, including videotapes for        patients and providers, a System User Brochure, specialized software for use         with a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), and software for a centralized server       which houses the database and communicates with the PDA via a wireless or modem      connection. A comprehensive field trial will follow 1 56 patients for nine           months to test the effectiveness of the MedMate system.                                 PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: ITS will work with RXI,  a national prescription benefits management company, to develop commercial relationships with pharmaceutical companies, pharmacies, and provider organizations. ITS/RXI plans to develop a varied revenue stream that would include a referral fee when patients or providers use the MedMate system to purchase prescriptions from commercial pharmacies, as well as nominal provider or patient subscription fees for use of the software and database. Given the size of the HIV/AIDS therapeutic market, which is estimated to reach $3.8 billion in the year 2000 and $8.2 billion by 2005, as well as the hundreds of million dollars spent on HIV/AIDS related research, the commercial impact of this project is extremely promising.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II application proposes to           adapt to Spanish, a previously developed multimedia version of the Addiction         Severity Index (ASI), called the ASI-MV. The ASI is reliable, valid, and the         most widely used measure of addiction severity, both in clinical and research        settings. It is now mandated in some governmental jurisdictions, and it may          become a standard assessment for chemical dependency. A major drawback of the        ASI is its interview format, and no validated Spanish version of the ASI             exists. Given that persons of Hispanic ethnicity form the most rapidly growing       ethnic group in the U.S. and that use of content valid assessments is vitally        important, we propose a content valid adaptation of the ASI-MV for Mexican           Americans, Cuban Americans, and Puerto Ricans. In Phase I, the ASI-MV script         was adapted to the Spanish language for the three, target Hispanic cultures and      pretested. In Phase II, the script will be incorporated into a prototype of the      CD-ROM program, called the Spanish-ASI-MV (S-ASI-MV). The Phase Il field trial       involves evaluation of the program's (1) test-retest reliability, (2) criterion      validity, and (3) discriminant validity. The final product will be marketed as       part of our extensive suite of substance abuse-related, multimedia tools.            PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The commercial impact of this project is promising.  Treatment facilities are increasingly  expected or mandated to comply with high standards of substance abuse assessment.  Marketing of the English version of the ASI-MV, a multimedia, interactive administration  of the Addiction Severity Index, has proceeded exceedingly well.  The ASI-MV permits  high-quality, reliable and valid patient assessments at a modest price and minimal personnel  time.  A Spanish adaptation of this program will extend the benefits of the ASI-MV to  Hispanic clinients who prefer Spanish.  Due to its reliability and low cost, we believe the  ASI-MV could become the \"Gold Standard\" addictions assessment. Under such a   circumstance, a Spanish adaptation would enjoy widespread use and profitability.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION:  We propose development of an interactive multimedia program, Special Report.  The program is designed to be offered as a tobacco risk assessment and educational tool for middle and junior high school students to increase knowledge about the effects of tobacco and personal risks for tobacco use, intention not to use tobacco, and self efficacy for avoiding tobacco use.  Designed to be offered in a single 50 minute session, Special Report will consist of:  1) a basic tobacco knowledge test and interactive risk assessment; 2) media literacy awareness exercises; 3) education about the short- and long-term physiological and psychological effects of tobacco use, including the progression to addiction; and 4) skill building activities to prevent the use of tobacco.  Phase I addressed development of a structure and prototype for this program using the input of early adolescents, parents, physicians and other experts in the area of tobacco education and prevention. All specific aims were accomplished, producing a technical design, working demo CD-ROM, and an outline of a supplemental facilitator manual, Phase II will involve production of a fully operational Special Report CD-ROM, usability testing, a field test of the effectiveness of the program, and satisfaction testing.  Based on our own knowledge and extensive discussions with educators and researchers, Special Report will be pioneering in its use of state-of-the-art technology for enhancing tobacco education.  If such a program demonstrated effectiveness in reducing risk behaviors and intent to use tobacco over traditional education approaches, school administrators and health educators would likely view it as a desirable and cost-effective way to offer education and prevention information to middle and junior high school students.  PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The commercial impact of this project is very promising.  There are currently 12 million students in the target age range (middle and junior high school) for Special Report [NCES, 1999]. Simultaneously, the issue of tobacco prevention in this age group has become a focus of intense national concern, since youth are most vulnerable to initiating tobacco use during these early adolescent years.  With funds from the recent tobacco settlement, more states are attempting to implement programs in this area.  Yet, few empirically-based, effective programs geared toward early adolescents are available.  If we were able to obtain only a small fraction of the middle and junior high schools in this country as customers, the revenues would be substantial.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION:  We propose developing a patient education CD-ROM for adults newly diagnosed with cancer.  The program is intended to:  1) reduce anticipatory distress; 2) help patients participate actively in their care; 3) facilitate adaptive coping via behavioral self-management; and 4) promote empowerment and enhance the capacity for self-advocacy.  The program seeks to limit users exposure to and facilitate resistance against the potential negative psychosocial consequences of illness and treatment.  The empowerment of people with cancer can facilitate better medical outcomes and the provision of higher quality care.  The interactive CD-ROM format seeks to reduce barriers of limited literacy, the need for flexibility in delivery (to account for the complex time demands of people newly diagnosed with cancer), and limitations imposed by physical illness that are common for those beginning treatment.  The program will allow individuals to target their specific concerns at their own pace while maximizing privacy.  The use of computer technology allows material to be presented in an engaging, interactive format with visually enhanced explanations.  The program will be developed with special sensitivity to consumer literacy and developed for a literacy level consistent with the general population.  Phase I addressed development of the structure and content for the intervention program.  Phase II will entail production of a completed version of the program, a clinical trial to test the efficacy and safety of the program, and an evaluation of end-user.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Phase II SBIR project is       to develop a clinically useful potentiator of the most widely used antifungal        drugs, azoles. The major shortcoming of azole drugs is that they do not kill         fungi but merely inhibit their growth. In fact, for the most medically               important fungal pathogen, Candida albicans, this growth inhibition is only          partial. The survival of the pathogen in the presence of the drug is the likely      cause of the recurrence of fungal infections and emergence of azole resistance.      Our Phase I studies identified two compounds in whose presence azoles become         strongly fungicidal. These compounds show no antifungal activity on their own        and no toxicity to human cells in culture. Structural derivatives of these two       leads, displaying improved activity and pharmacological properties, will be          obtained through intensive synthetic efforts. The biological activity of these       derivatives will be thoroughly characterized in vitro. Their ability to improve      antifungal activity of fluconazole will be tested in a murine model of systemic      candidiasis. Finally, the molecular mechanism of action of the potentiators          will be investigated in biochemical and genetic experiments. It is expected          that the compounds developed in this project will significantly improve the          improve the effectiveness of antifungal therapy. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The commercial product envisioned is a fungicidal combination of fluconazole with an adjuvant that potentiates antifungal activity. Such a product would have a major impact on the therapeutic and prophylactic treatment options for systemic Candida infections",

The vATON system will provide mariners with virtual representations of ATON hardware via information appliances, desktop computers ad augmented reality.  The augmented reality version of this system enables the mariner to perceive information as though they were located in the physical environment.  This system is built on WorldBoard technologies, which enable the geo-coding of data and delivery via Web servers to mobile computing devices and augmented reality displays.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Inframat proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating high frequency soft magnetic/ceramic nanocomposites for significantly improved magnetic performance for NASAs electronic equipment applications. The improved properties will include a combination of higher magnetic permeability, higher electrical resistivity, and lower magnetic loss compared with conventional NiFe2O4 and Co2Z ferrites. Over the past half century, conventional ferrites have been the only type of magnetic materials for high frequency applications, and the performance of ferrites is relatively poor. In the proposed work, magnetic/ceramic nanocomposite materials with various magnetic particle volume fractions will be manufactured using a wet-chemical synthesis technique. The magnetic performance of the as-fabricated end product will be tested and compared with conventional ferrites. The proposed magnetic nanocomposite technology is expected to have a major impact on NASAs power management and distribution applications. Inframat has aggressively sought to identify commercialization opportunities in the field of magnetic nanocomposite materials and has teamed with an experimental physicist from the Univ. of Delaware to develop commercial opportunities. The team will adopt IMCs patent pending economically viable aqueous synthesis technique to produce magnetic nanocomposite powders. The subsequent processing step will be the fabrication of desired shapes of magnetic components using press-sintering techniques.",

The SBIR 1 study found that THBT yielded short-term reductions in           insomnia compared to no treatment. These benefits were comparable to those           obtained from a classroom treatment at much less cost. The goal of the proposed      study will be extend these findings using a more precise methodology,                measurement of longer-term benefits, and comparison to an alternative self-help      treatment. Subjects will include 80 older adults with one of two common chronic      diseases with high rates of comorbid insomnia: osteoarthritis and coronary           artery disease. They will receive one of the two treatments: THBT with video         instruction on cognitive-behavioral (CB) techniques and 3-D audio relaxation         training; or bibliotherapy treatment using a previously tested CB self-help          book. Outcomes will be assessed at post-treatment and 1 year follow-up using         objective and self-report measures of sleep. Quality of life, functional status      and health care utilization benefits will be assessed. This study complements        an R01 proposal by the co-investigators which includes a classroom CB treatment      and a placebo treatment, thus allowing for outcome comparisons across a              continuum of behavioral treatment modalities.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Threats from microorganisms in the air as a result of natural phenomena or human-induced activities such as terrorism cannot be adequately monitored and evaluated with current technology. Many of the sensor and detector devices that have been underdevelopment for counter-terrorism and chem/biowarfare defense cannot function effectively without an up-front aerosol collector and particle separator.   InnovaTek's technology addresses this need with a novel approach that utilizes two componentsoperating in sequence to 1) separate large particles from the incoming airstream and 2) concentrate and retain small particles for identification. A large outer cyclone/centrifuge is used to separate particles > 50 micrometers and an inner bank of multiplewet-walled mini cyclones operating in parallel captures and concentrates small particles < 50 micrometers.Fieldable technologies that detect and identify toxic biological particles in the air provide the ability to warn and treat against exposure to harmful aerosolized particles such as biological warfare (BW) agents. InnovaTek's novel cycloneseparator/concentrator collects and concentrates biologically relevant particles from the air and removes large interfering particles so that effective and accurate identification of BW agents is possible.  In addition to its military application theproposed device is expected to be in high demand from a wide variety of global scale markets, including civil defense markets and emerging commercial markets such as public health, food production, and pharmaceutical/ medical applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Unedited Applicant's Abstract):The end-stage cardiac patients, who      cannot undergo heart transplantation owing to age limitation, lack of donor          hearts or complications in using immunosuppressive drugs are essentially             salvaged by LVAD and TAH devices. An estimated 40-70,000 American                    cardiovascular patients under age 65 could benefit from a heart transplant each      year, whereas only 2,400 patients actually receive such transplants. These           patients can benefit from the LVAD type devices both as a bridge to transplant       as well as an alternative treatment option. Of the -900 patients who have            received the LVAD system, a growing number are surpassing the three-year-mark        of continuous support with their LVAD device. With such growing number of            people on LVAD, there is a need for a reliable power system that could support       the devices for longer hours without interruption.                                                                                                                        In Phase I program, we demonstrated the feasibility of producing a low fuel          cell stack assembly, weighing -225 g and stack volume of 0.19 L. The                 performance of single cell matched those of the state-of-the-art while some          performance degradation was observed when single cells were assembled into a         stack. The cause for such degradation has been identified and since corrected.       The Phase II proposal concentrates on the engineering development of the power       pack. Further weight/volume reduction, heat and water management issues,             optimization of the membrane electrode assemblies, evaluation of the hydrogen        source, failure analysis and initial hazard analysis are the objectives of the       Phase II program. At the end of Phase II, a prototype unit with integrated           hydrogen storage will be fabricated and tested at the Artificial Organ               Development Center of the University of Pittsburgh.

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovative Research Phase II project will further the development of the electrochemical chlorine purification process and conduct a pilot trial with a 0.5 square meter cell at a chlor-alkali plant. During the Phase I phase, densities as high as 0.5 A/cm2 (at room temperature) were demonstrated for this process, with a potential of less than 300 mV at the highest current density. A pilot scale MP-cell with 100 cm2-electrode area was successfully demonstrated to purify chlorine in the flow through electrode mode using anion exchange membranes. Chlorine purity at the outlet was 100%. A complete mass balance was carried out for the chlorine gas and the chloride ion. The objectives of the Phase II program include (a) study and understanding of the mechanism of chlorine reduction in concentrated hydrochloric acid, (b) investigation of catalysis of both the chloride oxidation and chlorine reduction processes in concentrated HCl, (c) building a 0.5 square meter pilot cell, and (d) conducting field trials in a chlor-alkali plant with the pilot cell. At the end of Phase II, a detailed economic analysis would have been completed to enable commercialization efforts. The world chlor-alkali industry is projected to grow from the current production capacity of 42.1 million tons to 49 million metric tons in the year 2002. The total amount of tail gas to be processed is 562 million dollars through the year 2007 for a technology that replaces third stage liquefaction. The market for the second stage liquefaction is approximately 1.7 billion dollars. The U. S. market size for a low cost, energy efficient technology such as electrochemical purification is approximately 160 million dollars through 2007",

Phase I research has demonstrated thefeasibility and the validity of developing a unified computational model for efficient and accurate prediction of AC and DC electromagnetics, fluid flow, and heat transfer phenomena in ESR, VAR, and EB remelting processes under axisymmetric, steady stateconditions. Phase II research will involve extensions of the computational framework to enable a more comprehensive analysis of the physical phenomena. These include prediction of unsteady and three-dimensional effects, macrosegregation, microstructure,and inclusion transport. Emphasis is placed on achieving computational efficiency to facilitate effective use of the model. Thus, computational innovations include ballooning boundary conditions in electromagnetics analysis, expanding grid for treatingingot growth, two-domain method for predicting macrosegregation, and multigrid method for efficient solution. Experimental measurements on research and production units will be used for a detailed validation of the enhanced model. The model will then beapplied for the design and optimization of practical remelting processes by our industrial partners. This will be followed by a full-scale commercialization in Phase III effort.",

First, a combustor kinetics code will be implemented to predict performance and emissions when the combustor is burning jet fuel and air, with calculations being applied both to thecombustion tube of a pulse-detonation engine and to a high-equivalence-ratio gas-turbine combustor.  Second, a multi-dimensional computational code will be implemented to study important spatial and temporal behavior of relevance to instrumentation designand application.  Advanced instrumentation will also be demonstrated after the most relevant techniques have been selected.  Based on the success of our Phase I results in the combustor section of a production gas-turbine, a ruggedized, multi-pump CARSinstrument will be sonstructed and demonstrated for measuring pressure, temperature, and mole fractions of species such as N2, CO2, H2, and O2.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Considerable effort is currently focused on the possibility of using plasmas in air as a novel means of controlling the aerodynamic characteristics of vehicles flying at hypersonic speeds. Of special interest is the effect of weakly ionized plasmas on theflow of regions with intense dissipation such as shock waves and boundary layers. In a Phase I program we have explored the effect of low-pressure nonequilibrium plasmas on low- Mach-number shock waves. Methods were developed for accurately measuring boththe shock-wave flow field and the electrical characteristics of shock waves propagating in these types of discharges. Large dispersion of the shock waves and increases in speed were observed, while thermal effects were minimized. The plasma-generationtechniques developed in the Phase I program will be modified in Phase II to work at higher pressure and in larger gas volumes. Plasma-generation methods such as DC discharges, different types of rf excitation, externally ionized plasmas, and dielectricbarrier discharges will be considered. Analytical and diagnostic methods will be refined, especially using optical methods to obtain more detailed measurements of the resulting shock structure and to improve the understanding of physics of the shockwave-plasma interaction. Based on the results of Phase II, this technology can be extended to establish design parameters that are scalable to actual flight test vehicles. The plasma-generation techniques developed for shock-wave remediation may also bedirectly applicable for improving supersonic combustion.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Sustained hypersonic flights offer potentially revolutionary improvements in space access for military applications. Limiting factors in hypersonic vehicle performance include aerodynamic drag and heating rates. Recent research has indicated thathypersonic flow fields may be modified significantly by magnetic Lorentz forces through the creation and manipulation of plasma near the vehicles. Such concepts can be used to control hypersonic flows by suppressing or enhancing boundary-layer transitionin order to significantly reduce both drag and heating rates. On the other hand, MHD control of hypersonic flows presents a challenge which requires not only an understanding of the complex hypersonic MHD flow physics but also the creation of large volumesof plasma and strong magnetic fields. We propose to carry out Phase II numerical and experimental studies with the objective of developing plasma flow control technology focused on the suppression or enhancement of hypersonic boundary layer transition. Wewill design optimal plasma control strategies and study their effectiveness for the MHD control of stability and transition of hypersonic boundary layer flows over a flat plate and a blunt wedge. The effects and efficiency of various potential controlstrategies will be investigated by normal-mode linear stability analyses, direct numerical simulations, and experimental studies.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Optical emissions sensors have the potential to be used in gauging combustion activity and quantifying heat release, fuel-air mixture, and combustor efficiency within a wide variety of combustor devices (both stationary and mobile).  We propose to developboth chemiluminescence sensors-to derive equivalence ratio within the cavity pilot flame from the measured quantities, OH*, CH* and/or C2*-and infrared emissions sensors-to derive combustor efficiency from measured quantities, H2O, CO2, CO andtemperature-for supersonic combusting ramjet (scramjet) engines.  The principal advantage of this approach over other optical-sensors-based approaches (e.g., absorption) is greater simplicity, since only a suitable photodetector is needed.  In addition,solid-state optical emissions sensors are rugged, possess a wide field of view, require minimal optical access, and can be configured for species selectivity.  During the Phase II program, we will develop combustor optical emission sensor hardware andsoftware for implementation in a scramjet combustor.  Additional tasks involve designing rugged coupling optics/electronics and testing these designs in a direct-connect scramjet test facility.",

In this proposal, we present evidence that selected novel inhibitors of              poly(DP-ribose) synthetase (PARS) are (1) cytoprotective agents and inhibitors       of oxidant-induced cell necrosis in vitro, (2) inhibitors of the production of       macrophage-derived pro-inflammatory mediators in vitro, (3) potent anti-shock        systemic inflammation in rats and mice and, finally (4), a selected, potent          member of this novel class of PARS inhibitors (e.g. PJ34) provides dramatic          protection in a porcine model of severe homodynamic collapse and shock . These       observations, coupled with data from the applicant's laboratories and several        other research groups, demonstrating that PARS knockout mice are massively           protected against various forms of shock, collectively support the applicant's       proposal, which is that potent pharmacological inhibitors of PARS can be             developed as a novel class of anti-shock agents. The applicant's intend to           develop PJ34 as an anti-shock drug. The first specific aims of the present           proposal is to perform additional studies in the rodent and porcine system with      PJ34 to determine the window of intervention, the most appropriate dose of           administration, and to determine the optimal strategy for discontinuation of         the agent. An additional specific aim of the proposal is to synthesize large         GMP-quantities of the PJ34 compound, and to formulate as an intravenous              injectable. These studies will be performed in the second year, followed by          formal preclinical toxicity studies, and Phase I a study in normal human             volunteers. The current project will enable the applicants to move forward in        two years, near to the level of the beginning of Phase II efficacy trial in          septic patients.

        "abstract": "Abstract         DoD collects large amounts of digital imagery from diverse sources such as hospital radiologydepartments, satellites, unmanned surveillance vehicles.  To systematically analyze these data,one must be able to denoise, segment, annotate, store, transmit, index, screen, and retrieveimages in a consistent and easy-to-use environment.  All these tasks rely on image processingtechniques to extract information from raw imagery.Traditional image enhancement and segmentation techniques take a global view of image,processing the entire image without considering local variations.  Multiscale image processingtechniques based on curvature-driven flows overcome many of the problems of traditionalprocessing methods since mutliscale techniques focus on features of data that are found atdifferent scales and resolutions.We propose to develop image enhancement and segmentation, algorithms using curvature-based flow-driven nonlinear partial differential equation imaging models and algorithms,including total variation, level-set, active contour techniques.  We propose to integrate thesetechniques into Java GUI that interfaces with a database and scripting language to provideman-in-the-loop processing, feature extraction, and analysis of image data.  We willdemonstrate the system on applications in medical and tactical imaging, or to Army sponsor-directed imaging applications.  This technology will improve the ability to analyze, index, andsearch digital imagery.",

The developed methodologies are also applicable to      data with missing covariates. To achieve this, much of our research effort will      be devoted towards combinging algorithms in regression calibration, SIMEX and        iterative imputation methods into a software package. These methodologies will       be matured by incorporating diagnostic techniques, sensitivity analyses, and         graphical methods into the software package. In the Phase I feasibility study,       algorithms have been developed for univariate Gaussian and logistic regression.      These methods will be extended to covariate measurement error in modeling            correlated responses such as in longitudinal or spatial data.

Currently, there is         little or no commercial software in this area. The aim of the proposed research      is to overcome this deficiency and bring the benefits of measurement error           models to a wide audience of biomedical analysts and practitioners. The S+ME         module will be implemented as an object-oriented software in the S-Plus              language.

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Applicant's abstract verbatim): Identification and segmentation of      the constituent parts of a human brain in three-dimensional (3-D) magnetic           resonance imaging (MRI) studies is a starting point for much of the current          research into human brain structure and function. Accurate segmentation and          registration allows clinicians and researchers to track and measure changes in       the brain over time. Manual brain morphometry is a laborious and time consuming      task. The voluminous amount of data and the specialized knowledge required to        manually analyze a human brain image preclude clinical studies from rapidly          moving forward. In order to address this problem, we propose the creation of a       commercial software package that would register and normalize a subject's brain      image to a digital atlas of neuroanatomy as well as rigidly align two brain          images. Anatomic labels identified on the atlas can then be automatically            mapped to segment the corresponding structures in the registered subject image.      Normalizing to an atlas allows measurements of brain structure and function          from a group of subjects to be compared with respect to the reference space          established by the atlas. Rigid alignment of two brain images allows the             detection of changes in longitudinal studies. Our software will also provide         tools for region-of-interest analysis. We believe that the ability to                automatically make structural and functional measurements and to detect changes      in the brain is a major advantage of our approach.                                   PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  There is no commercial software available that allows 3-D MR brain images to be  automatically registered to an atlas, along with performing atlas-derived measurements.  Our software would fill a niche in the conduct of brain imaging studies in the pharmaceutical  industry and address the needs of academic researchers.  Part of our commercialization  plan will be to provide a brain mapping service for customers who require standardized  protocols or who cannot afford to access the necessary resources in terms of personnel,  software, hardware, and training.  These customers would securely transmit their MRI brain  data to MathSoft over the Internet for processing and receive the output electronically.  This  technology can be extended to the segmentation of other parts of the body.  Another  commercially attractive direction for future application of this software is screening and  characterization for animal imaging studies.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In completing Phase I of this grant,            Integrated Genomics has produced an almost complete genomic sequence of              Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC25586), leaving only 15 gaps. We have also              assigned functions to ORFs using our propriety ERGO IM genomic analysis              software suite.                                                                                                                                                           In Phase II, we will use our proprietary algorithms to correlate hypothetical        ORFs with \"orphan functions\" missing from reconstructed metabolic pathways.          Since F. nucleatum is known to be highly variable, we will completely sequence       an additional hospital-isolated strain. We will choose this isolate based on         its genetic distance from our sequenced strain. Further characterization of          strain variability will be accomplished by SSH (suppressive subtractive              hybridization), which will allow us to rapidly compare many other strains to         our completely characterized isolates. We will sequence the resulting                differences. We will design and manufacture F. nucleatum whole-genome                microarrays and use them to probe the microbe's physiological states, some of        which will mimic the stresses experienced during human infection. This will          potentially reveal protective mechanisms and sensitive protein targets. Based        on the results of strain-to-strain differences, we will develop a diagnostic         chip to detect and rapidly characterize pathogenic states of F. nucleatum.           Finally, we will over-express and enzymologically characterize selected protein      targets found by the proposed combination of computational biology and               whole-genome expression studies.                                                                                                                                          Phase III will involve the verification of potential drug targets revealed in        this study and commercialization of the proprietary DNA arrays.                      PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  Commercialization of this work include potential vaccines against certain novel  Fusobacterium nucleatum proteins, and an antibiotic targeted against a unique  Fusobacterium nucleatum biosynthetic pathway.",

These methods are designed to optimize the gathering of target location and identification information from controllable sensors at multiple locations. Specific DISCO compo-nents to be developedor extended include: 1) simulation of battlefield environment including air and ground target motion, terrain features, and foliage coverage; 2) controllable target tracking sensors providing target location and identification information; 3) sampletracking and sensor management methods to test and demon-strate the DISCO testbed; and 4) traditional and new (information-theoretic) meas-ures of effectiveness for evaluating candidate methods. Some components of the DISCO Testbed will be extracted into astand-alone Toolkit, to support performance evalu-ation at other Air Force laboratories.",

The approach integrates an eclectic combination of             technologies from experimental design, statistics, experts systems, and              laboratory automation. In Phase I, we successfully demonstrated feasibility of       the approach by constructing a prototype application and using it to solve           reaction development problems in academic and pharmaceutical research settings.      In Phase II, we will (1) extend the experimental design and analysis                 capabilities of the prototype; (2) implement the capability for automated            execution of experimental designs; (3) incorporate an intelligent agent; and         (4) test, evaluate and validate the software in conjunction with academic,           pharmaceutical research, and instrument vendor collaborators. The ultimate goal      of the program is to develop a commercial software application that enables          chemists to improve their productivity and to accelerate and reduce the cost of      drug development.        PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Deployment of the software application In a drug discovery and development  organization is expected to offer 4 principal benefits: (1) improve the productivity  of the chemist; (2) increase throughput of drug candidates; (3) reduce the cost of  multi-step and compound library synthesis; and (3) shorten drug discovery and  development timelines.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         IAI is working with a partner company, Time Domain,  Incorporated to develop and apply a new type of radio called Time-Modulated Ultra-Wideband radio. When two TM-UWB radios communicate, each immediately knows the range to the other to within approximately.1 inch. TM-UWB radios do not transmit continuous radio waves like conventional radio.  Only pulses are transmitted, and power is used only during the short duration of those pulses.  A typical duty cycle is 1/000, with pulse widths of approximately 1nanosecond. Pulses in the time domain result in very wideband signals in the frequency domain, which make them very difficult to intercept and jam resistant. The lower frequency component of the signal allows the signals to penetrate foliage, walls, andother obstacles.  TM-UWB is much simpler than conventional radio because what is output is a pulse which is generated by a single transistor which is ON or OFF.  Since there is no intermediate frequency, there is no up-conversion and no down-conversion.TM-UWB is almost totally unaffected by multipath interference, and requires no specific spectrum allocation from the FCC.  This proposal details the development of a system called Urban Location TRAcking (ULTRA) which uses TM-UWB as the kernel forcommunication and tracking.",

Conventional approaches to noise elimination use only one sensor, i.e. the ordinary microphone. Although noise can be eliminated, the distortion ofthe speech signal due to signal processing actually reduces speech recognition rates even compared to the original noisy speech signal.In this Phase II proposal, Intelligent Automation, Inc. (IAI) will develop hardware that fuses information from different forms of speech sensors. In particular, we will fuse information from a new type of microphone called a Glottal ElectromagneticMicropower Sensor (GEMS) microphone developed by LLNL, camera images quantifying lip motion, bone conduction microphones, and ordinary microphones.  The work will require refinement of our Phase 1 camera sensor for quantifying lip motion, and refinement ofthe GEMS sensor developed by LLNL, as well as further development of our signal fusion methodology.  Our Phase I results have clearly demonstrated the feasibility of our proposed approach, however substantial additional algorithmic and hardware developmentwork is still needed.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         To move beyond teleoperated control of robot manipulators for ISS assembly and maintenance applications, robot controllers that support interactive learning will be required. It is not possible for ground personnel to anticipate all scenarios in which robot assistants in space will be involved and pre-program their response. It will also be increasingly incumbent on the robot to ascertain the intent of the user and be able to learn from user actions to improve its performance. During Phase I, we will implement an unsupervised learning method for selected portions of a manipulator controller. During Phase II we will integrate both supervised and unsupervised learning into an integrated demonstration in which the robot serves as a cooperative assistant. The supervised learning would take place using instrumented gloves or conventional teleoperator controls. The user would bootstrap the robot into operation by demonstrating some portion of a task, after which the robot would improve its performance as it goes. Of course, the operator could intervene at any time to re-program the robot if it becomes stuck. During Phase II, we propose to implement and interface the learning system to the Robotics Research Corp. manipulators at the JSC Cooperative Manipulation Testbed.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The key innovation of this proposal is the use of Time Modulated  Ultra-Wideband (TM-UWB) technology to develop a low cost radio system that  allows both voice communication and tracking positions of fire fighters  inside buildings. This radio has several characteristics which make it  ideal for tracking multiple individuals without line-of-sight. During  Phase I we have performed many tests, including basic ranging, 3-D  position determination, communication through fire, smoke, steam, and  different kinds of walls. We have developed a new system architecture to  track the location of a fire fighter, which is more scalable, less  sensitive to errors due to multipath and wall penetration than the  multilateration based scheme, and does not require clock synchronization.  This scheme uses a two-antenna array which transmits two consecutive  TM-UWB pulses. The fire fighter carries a receive-only TM-UWB tag which  will receive these pulses. By measuring the Time Difference of Arrival  (TDOA) of these pulses, the mobile unit can calculate the Angle of Arrival  (AOA), which in turn gives the 3-D location. During Phase II, we will  conduct more extensive tests to characterize the multipath effects, noise  problem, material penetration, etc. We will implement the AOA architecture  and construct prototype tags and a base unit.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The key innovation of this proposal is implementation of a Time Modulated Ultra-wideband (TM-UWB) radio to implement a bi-directional astronaut to spacecraft wireless link. Our innovation will also provide a real-time reading of the position of the astronaut, and with two small conformal antennas on the astronaut, it will provide the astronaut orientation and position in real-time. Within the last few years low cost ultra-high precision oscillators have become available, and these now make it possible to build TM-UWB communication systems which have no base band frequency. The only signals transmitted are pulses which can be generated by a single transistor which is either on or off. Impulses in the time domain generate very wide bandwidth signals in the frequency domain, and the signals generated by our current hardware have bandwidths in the several gigahertz range. With TM-UWB transmission, there is little chance of multipath interference, and the transmission is inherently secure since if you don't know the specific pseudo-random pulse pattern being used, the transmission is well below the noise in any detectable frequency range. Since the duty cycle of pulse transmission is small (.001), average power consumption is very small compared to radios which transmit continuously at some baseband frequency.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In this proposal, Intelligent Automation, Incorporated (IAI) proposes an Automated Non-intrusive Health Monitoring tool for simultaneous component or structure degradation monitoring (trend analysis), fault detection, and diagnostics in ground systems. This prognostic technique, or health monitoring (HM) tool, can be combined with IAI's internetworking software to provide remote monitoring capability. The innovation will also allow us to detect new fault conditions that have not occurred before. This may include sensor failures and hence, the capability of validity self-checks. Our algorithm uses one major tool: Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA is a powerful technique for extracting the features inside the sensor signals. A major advantage of PCA is that supervised learning is unnecessary. Another advantage of PCA is that we can use it for degradation monitoring or reliability assessment. It can also be used for early detection of cracks, fatigue, and corrosion signatures buried in sensor signals. General sensor fusion architecture will be used for fusing different decisions. The proposed method is relevant to the subtopic because our innovation can provide a trend analysis that detects structural degradation due to cracks, corrosion, and fatigue. The purpose is to reduce the likelihood of structural or other failures in ground systems such as engines and gearboxes.Key Words:Non-intrusive health monitoring sensor fusion PCA",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the next generation data networks which will require terabit information handling capability. Future networks must be reconfigurable, highly secure and easily upgraded in both bit rate and number of nodes. The company will apply its extensive fiber optic expertise and its proprietary wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) technology to the development of a reconfigurable high-speed fiber-optic backbone structure that supports the transmission of multiple data protocols between multiple network stations. The approach is based on the company's all-fiber, static and dynamic WDM network access designs which offer high efficiency, compactness and low cost. In Phase I a three-node, two-wavelength system was constructed with static access modules to demonstrate the feasibility of simultaneously transmitting different protocols such as ATM and Ethernet. Phase I formed a basis for Phase II engineering development where the reseacher will employ dynamic access modules and expand the network to 8 nodes and 4 wavelengths to demonstrate network reconfigurability and scalability. The market for fiber-optic networks is growing at a rate of over 20% per year and is expected to exceed $18 billion in 2001. Multi-protocol fiber backbones have applications in commercial platforms, such as enterprise networks, ships, airliners, automobiles, and integrated manufacturing equipment. Each optical fiber can replace hundreds of wires resulting in substantial drop in costs, component weight, and an increase in performance. The project will integrate well with the Internet-II, and SuperNet programs for the government-wide Next Generation Internet (NGI).",

Conventional approaches involve cumbersome sample collection and laboratory analysis.  This is time intensive and very costly, in part because of the need for experts.  Crucial long-term, continuous monitoring of sites to insure that wastes do not migrate is not currently feasible.  This project will develop a smart, cost-effective system for autonomous, real-time characterization and quantitative analysis of hazardous chemicals in a variety of matrices.  Because of its built-in smart spectral interpretation capabilities and self-diagnostic functions, the device will report continuously without the need for experts or on-site technicians.  In Phase I, a test demonstration proved the ability of the smart spectral analysis approach to detect the target contaminants (PCE and TCE) in isolation and in real-world spectra taken from a mixture of materials from a typical remediation target site.  Phase II will create a prototype instrument and field test it.  Design recommendations will be developed for a next generation of instruments incorporating this smart analysis technology, for use with both hazardous waste evaluation and monitoring, and for application to water quality assurance, biohazard containment, and many other areas.

The proposed fiber optic sensing technology is directly applicable to NASA's Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) strategy. MFOS system operation is based on the use of miniature optrodes (optical point sensors) sensitive to cryogenic fuel and effluent gases distributed at multiple locations along the length of an optical fiber bus. Using a novel fluorescence-based approach to hydrogen sensing allows common signal processing (quench-monitoring) for both oxygen and hydrogen; a third temperature-sensitive fluorescent optrode assures good performance over the entire 0F to 140 F temperature range. The proposed MFOS technology offers a low-cost, reliable solution to reducing planned ground processing (trouble shooting) through the predictive capabilities of real-time monitoring of system health and streamlined problem isolation, and will improve ground and flight safety through early detection and prediction of component failures and by improving visibility into critical safety systems.",

Currently installed tokamak control systems typically fail to make use of the full potential of available equipment.  These systems often require significant operator intervention to tune control action between discharges.  This project will develop a  neural network-based approximator to produce a robust adaptive control scheme.  An adaptive control algorithm will be designed to perform real-time plasma shape and boundary control.  In Phase I, measurement data on various plasma equilibrium modes was acquired and analyzed.  A Matlaba-based toolbox was developed, consisting of linear and neural network approximators that were capable of learning and predicting with high accuracy the behavior of plasma parameters.  The development of a control algorithm capable of using the model of the plasma obtained by the neural network approximator was begun.  In Phase II, the development of the neural-network-based control algorithm will be completed.  The algorithm will be integrated into currently used control software for real-time control of a tokamak.  The successful performance of the algorithm will be verified by comparing the predicted outputs to a well-established computer model of tokamak operation and to actual measurements from the data acquisition equipment.                    Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The tools developed in this project will demonstrate the feasibility of using neural network architectures for control of a plasma fusion reactor and should play a large role in the success of fusion as a viable energy source.

The proposed software will allow screen readers to automatically generate task-specific scripts--sophisticated macros that determine the behavior of the screen reader in response to the current state of an application--based on an analysis of the user's actions while performing a specific task. The end result of this project will be a functioning prototype screen reader (based on Henter-Joyce's JAWS (Job Access With Speech) screen reader) with the ability to observe the user's actions, identify the user's goal based on those actions (referred to as plan recognition), and then either create a script that automates the task of achieving that same goal in the future or remind the user that such a script already exists. Throughout the course of the project, feedback will be sought from members of the visually impaired community through user trials, focus groups, and formal experimentation. While investigators will work exclusively with the JAWS screen reader during Phase II, many of the algorithms developed during this project will be applicable to other screen readers. The software developed will be licensed to others to improve the performance of existing and new screen readers. The enhanced screen reading software will provide a number of significant benefits. First and foremost, the visually impaired will have significantly improved access to computers for both personal and job-related activities. They will be able to use computers for tasks that were previously impossible or impractical, and they will be able to perform their current activities faster and more effectively. Second, employers will be more open to employing the visually impaired because of the reduced cost in time and effort of job training and the increased level of productivity; visually impaired employees will be able to do more jobs, will be able to learn jobs faster, and will be able to do their jobs better than before",

Nevertheless, software visionaries speculate that one day an engineer will be able to specify the function that a software module is intended toperform, and then a set of agents, each associated with a debugged module, would be able to coordinate among themselves and synthesize the desired result. While the state-of-the-art is a far cry from this vision, this SBIR effort is intended to make aquantum leap in this direction by reformulating software development as a synthetic, compositional process that exploits case-based planning, rule-based reasoning, and design patterns to guide software developers in the adaptive software constructionactivity. In Phase I, we created the system. Phase II will implement and transition a working prototype of the tool suite to DoD acquisition programs, PACOM, aerospace companies, and research institutes for evaluation and feedback.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Associated with space operations, satellite command and control is costly in terms of manpower and training that run continuously throughout the life of the mission.  For a cluster of collaborating satellites, the operations complexity is significantlyincreased. Distributed, virtual, cluster commanding is transparently commanding an entire satellite cluster via any one satellite in the cluster. The development of architectures and algorithms for facilitating distributed, virtual, cluster commanding andautonomous operation provides many benefits. These benefits include reducing the size of the ground crew, the required bandwidth of the satellite-to-ground link, and decreasing the need for scheduled or dedicated ground assets (antennas, control stations,etc.).Additionally, two major areas of concern have been identified for the support of large constellations of satellites: fault management and planning and scheduling.In the past, fault detection, isolation and recovery (FDIR) were the sole responsibility of the Ground system. As more complex formations are developed, the need for FDIR to be addressed on-board at the cluster level is becoming critical to reducing thecost and complexity of cluster operations.Similarly, in order to relieve the ground from individually tasking each element of the constellation, the resolution of goals must be resolved on-board in a distributed manner. To do this, planning and scheduling has to be tightly integrated within theSpace-Ground Architecture.ICS is proposing, in this Phase-II, the further development of an agent-based architecture for real-time autonomous Command & Telemetry systems.  The architecture is being expanded to include enhanced adaptive data acquisition and summarization, enhancedexpert system capability including fuzzy logic agents, and a tightly coupled integration with Government off-the-shelf (GOTS) Planning and Scheduling software.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant): We screened a panel of synthetic            compounds for inhibition of HIV-1 infection of primary macrophages cultures.         Three positive leads ITI-Ol I, ITI-053 and 111-062 were selected and shown to        specifically interrupt the binding of isolated pre-integration complexes (PlC)       with recombinant karyopherin alpha. In addition, the three compounds inhibited       the nuclear importation of the PlC carrying the nascent cDNA as determined by        reduction of 2-LTR circle forms of the viral DNA. ITI-011 and ITI-062 were also      shown to inhibit infection of primary activated peripheral blood mononuclear         cells (PBMC), as well as to abrogate infection of lymphoid tissue blocks in an       in vitro histoculture model for HIV-I infection. ITI001 exhibited additive           effect when combined with AZT or nelfinavir, and was active against an AZT           resistant virus. Preliminary analysis showed that ITI-011 had an in vitro            therapeutic index of more than 500 and did not alter primary CD4+ T cell             activation at the effective antiviral concentrations. ITI-011 was orally             bio-available in rodents, and exhibited little to no acute animal toxicity.          Additional pre-clinical characterization of ITI-Ol1, as well as full                 characterization of ITI-053 and ITI-062 will be pursued in the Phase II SBIR         sponsored studies, to determine the optimum lead candidate for initiation of         Phase I clinical studies.

This project will extend the useful sensitive depth of individual and segmented oxide passivated Si detectors to the 1-3 mm range and incorporate high value monolithic resistors on the same substrate.  Phase I extended a previously developed technique for neutron transmutation doping to make very high resistivity <100> Si.  It was also demonstrated that the flat band voltage is lower for <100> than for <111> for the same resistivity.  Finally the proposed technique for improved surface passivation was shown to be feasible.  In Phase II, the  neutron transmutation doping will be combined with two new techniques for reducing the flat band voltage of the oxide passivation and for reducing channel conductance and surface recombination currents.  Very high sheet resistivities on Si surfaces will be produced for the fabrication of monolithic high value resistors.             Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The availability to oxide passivated deep Si detectors will make an important contribution to radiation detection and spectroscopy application in many diverse areas ranging from particle physics research to industrial x-ray spectroscopy.

        "abstract": "Abstract         In Phase I of this program, we proposed, and demonstrated a novel method for producing low loss on chip waveguides without etching.  We propose, in Phase II, to focus on the materials unique optical properties, that is, not only a brad range of asdeposited index of refraction but the ability to be processed to given specific values in plane with refraction but the ability to be processed to given specific values in plane with photoexposure.  In Phase I we were able to produce materials which hadindex changes of over 1.0 after exposure.  In Phase I we were able to produce materials which had index changes of over 1.0 after exposure. In Phase II we will attempt to double this range.  We will complete material characterization, including long termstability, and process optimization begun in  Phase I.  We will combine our material/process with innovative lithographic techniques to economically produce structures with design specific index of refraction.  We will produce prototype phased arraydevices for high density wavelength division multiplexing.  In addition to optimizing conventional designs, we will investigate embedding micro-optical components which would, for example, provide compensation for polarization mode losses.  Phase II willconclude with the development of high volume production capable material and process as well as the prototyping and testing of initial devices.  The success of the Phase II program will result in commercialization of photonic devices that capitalize on thesmaller device size, a 20X advantage, to either produce devices of equal area with 20X more functionality (20X the number of channels in a demultiplexer for example) or produce equivalent devices with 1/20 the capital expenditure and at least 80% less thancurrent prices.  Additional competitive advantages results from the elimination of propagation losses with etch free produced waveguides and, reduction of polarization dependent loss in planar waveguide devices by at least an order of magnitude (providinga 10X increase in performance).  We will use these advantages to secure at least 10% of the projected multi-billion dollar planar waveguide device market.",

Reliable, stable optical routing devices will bring the high speed optical network backbone closer to the end user and increase total network speed dramatically.  This project will develop devices for optical switching and modulating using an innovative non linear polymer.  The electro-optic property of the polymer enables its use for optical switching.  The innovative method of forming the polymer provides not only superior electro-optic performance but long term stability as well.  Phase I selected appropriate reactants, modified equipment as necessary for the polymerization process, synthesized the polymers, and measured both their non linear optical properties and their stability versus time and temperature.  The electro-optic properties exceeded published literature values and confirmed excellent stability of both optical and mechanical properties.  Phase II will optimize reactant selection and refine the deposition apparatus for high volume production capability.  Prototype devices will be fabricated, and their performance will be characterized before and after life testing.

Our phase I effort will be to fabricate an innovative ionizer structure and implement it in our existing compact time-of-flight analyzer design. We will further implement a molecular beam inlet system which increases sensitivity and reduces pumping requirements. The resulting instrument will be rugged, low power and suitable for remote monitoring of gas composition. A target cost for the entire unit not including pumping will be less than 10,000 dollars.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Heterogeneous integration of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) with polymer based electro-optic (EO) modulators is proposed, to produce compact and deployable modulators for RF photonics applications. Current technology allows fabrication of compactand light-weight modulators, but these interferometric devices are still not truly deployable, because they require control and feedback electronics for balancing and stabilization.  EO polymer technology  capable of producing 100GHz, sub-one-voltmodulators will be combined with MEMS technology that provides high Q resonators and filters that operate in the KHz-MHz frequencies.   The approach is to mechanically balance an EO modulator using a MEMS resonant structure, and integrate balancingcircuitry (which includes high Q MEMS band-pass filters) by either integrating on the same substrate or via flip-chip bonding, contained in the same modulator package.  DC biasing and RF modulation are separated, eliminating the need for wide-band biasingcomponents, and avoiding bias drift problems that are common in electrical biasing.  This work builds on the success of the Phase I effort, where mechanical biasing and heterogeneous integration are experimentally demonstrated.  Successful completion ofthis work will allow 2 to 3 orders of magnitude reduction in size, mass and power consumption over current methods, and will enable low cost fabrication of high-frequency modulators.",

Optical push-pull will be used to reduce the half-wave voltage to less than 1 volt, and waveguide and fiber tapering methods will be utilized to reduce insertionlosses lower than 6 dB.  Our three-dimensional adiabatic tapered waveguide transitions combined with lensed or tapered fiber will result in low optical interface loss.  We will attempt to incorporate modulator technology developed during Phase II inIPITEK's wide bandwidth analog and digital communication systems.  The potential for commercial applications is excellent, and high optical power throughput with low losses, high dynamic range, small size, and low cost will satisfy both military andcommercial requirements, and fit IPITEK's present and continuing marketing and sales agenda.",

Feasibility of this technique will be explored against two other cogeneric North American species: R. frustrana and E. gloriola.

Real and exaggerated risks associated with IPM/BMPs have been consistently identified as a primary reason why farmers do not adopt them. Corn and cotton account for 50% of pesticides used on major crops. In ongoing Phase I research, we have complied a detailed compendium of IPM/BMP tactics used in corn and cotton: identified those most likely to impact input use, yields and profits; assessed risk as barrier to adoption; located experts and actuarial data to support probability and severity of failure; and developed feasible scenarios for offering comprehensive IPM/BMP financial risk management products to protect farmers and their advisors from consequences of failures. In Phase II, we will complete data packages for comprehensive financial risk management in corn and cotton through to pricing by an underwriter, including determining optimum product form to maximize benefits to users and rural economics. Methods and results from this project will have applications in broadening adoption of economically and environmentally sound practices in other crops, livestock, aquaculture and forestry, with potential for improving air, water and soil quality.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Principles of self-determination form the core of a new model of supports for adults with developmental disabilities who often rely on others for on-going assistance in daily living activities. Workers providing these direct supports influence opportunities for self- determination-the control over, choice in, and responsibility for one's daily life. The purpose of this project is to deliver innovative content on the concepts and practices of promoting self-determination in a video- based training package for direct support workers. As institutional residential settings are being phased out in favor of community placements, and states across the country scramble to meet the needs of thousands on waiting lists for community services, support agencies are pressured to continually recruit and train new staff. The proposed video training package offers an affordable means of providing up-to-date training to the newly hired as well as the existing 400,000 residential and vocational staff. The Phase I video introduced viewers to six components of promoting self-determination. In Phase II, a complete set of four videos and user guides will be developed to provide detailed information and practice activities on all six components of supporting self-determination. Phase II activities will include evaluating the effectiveness of the training materials using a randomized two-group pre-post design with 200 subjects. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: To meet the training needs of 400,000 direct support workers, effective and inexpensive methods of training are needed. This video training will provide service agencies with a cost-effective way to train workers on the new model of self-determination. IRIS Media will market and disseminate the product through direct marketing to service agencies as well as placing the product with leading industry distributors.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION: The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop, produce,        and test an interactive multimedia training program (IMM) on providing quality       retirement and leisure services to older adults with developmental                   disabilities. The IMM program will be designed primarily for use by direct           support staff that work with these older adults in residential and day               programs. Other users who will benefit include parents, advocates, case              managers from the developmental disabilities service network, and community          program staff from the aging service network. The complete program addresses         five training interactive modules in the area of retirement and leisure: 1)          understanding the leisure experience, 2) leisure awareness and appreciation, 3)      community opportunities and resources, 4) assessment and skill development, and      5) choice making and decision making about leisure activities. In Phase I, a         prototype IMM program on CD-ROM (Leisure Works!) covering three sub-topics in        Module 1-understanding the leisure experience-was produced. Its efficacy was         evaluated in a pre-/post-test study involving direct support workers. In Phase       II, the IMM program will be expanded to include the rest of Module 1 and four        additional modules. The Phase II program will be evaluated in a randomized           controlled study (with a sample of 100 direct support staff and 100 residents)       assessing knowledge, skills, and behavioral outcomes.                                PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  There is a growing need for retirement and leisure training strategies for direct care staff in  adult service settings.  Given the aging of the developmentally disable population, there is  tremendous potential for innovative tools to help administrators effectively and efficiently train  staff.  This interactive multimedia program will be marketed to vocational/day and residential  programs, county chapters of The Arc, and State/County agencies serving adults with  developmental disabilities.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This proposal is to combine the proven high density 3D packing technology with the ultra high performance of low temperature superconductor memory technology.  The maturity level of the memory is approaching 16 Kbits per square centimeter.  The memory is akey enabler for superconductor electronics processing but to be practical for near-term applications, larger blocks of this memory must be assembled into very compact packages which maintains the high speed and low latency attributes of the very highspeed, ultra low power memory technology.  The dense packing technology as developed by ISC provides such an assembly capability.  The focus will be on developing a high density NbN, serial memory module of 4 Mb capacity in a footprint of few cm2.  Serialsuperconductor memory is the only memory technolgy that provides the speed of access and sata transfer rates necessary to match future requirements of ultra fast processors for focal plane array signal processing and high density, ultra fasttelecommunication switches.",

Ontology tools construct and maintain formal semantic representations that will build andmanage more complex and complete plans.  Smart editors using active template technology will be used to narrow the selection of defaults based on user context of problem defined by initial entries and commands.  Plan library functions will allow selectionof partial plans and strategy models from libraries of previous plans, and rapidly compose new plans. The EFFECTOR system will be architected as an E-Commerce solution using light weight web-server technologies, exploiting Java applets/servelets and DHTMLto provide dynamic information presentations. The user will load and exchange data by exchanging documents, where the human-readable information presentation is augmented with XML-based markup to transmit the needed machine-readable symbolic content. Userswill be able to selectively share data to collaborate in building strategy models and plans.These technologies achieve dynamic DoD military planning goals and is directly extended to organization strategic planning, such as 5-year strategic plans developed by Federal Government Offices. EBO EFFECTOR tools provide plan effects, effect mechanisms,and effect metrics for strategic objectives.",

The problem we address in this proposal is how to provide useful training in a simulated decision environment, in order to improve the situation awareness of leaders.There also appears to be a move towards more distributed command and control, thus, the need is to provide training that will help commanders build situation awareness skills for working with distributed teams.  The opportunity is to apply Decision Nettechnology to the requirement for training situation awareness in leaders in a digital environment that mimics the essential characteristics of a real battlefield.  Decision Net is a human facilitated decision game that can be delivered over the net.  Thusyou get very effective training at a low cost and delivered frequently.  In addition, it can be used to experiment with new processes and new decision support tools at the concept stage prior to being implemented.",

A second related application can be used to identify tissue type         with remarkable specificity. Further, such identification is independent of the      x-ray geometric path length through the tissue, and is done by measuring and         imaging the tissue-specific ratio of the total attenuation to the coherent           small-angle deBye scattering production, that, in turn, sensitively depends on       the average atomic number (relative compositions of carbon, oxygen, and higher       Z atoms), and also on the average protein-folding length. Both schemes are           non-invasive, in-vivo, require no contrast agent, have low dosage, and require       only short duration exposures. Both are accomplished using polychromatic x-rays      from a conventional medium power x-ray tube, and lead to low-cost                    clinically-practical devices. Proof-of-principle experiments for both schemes        have now been successfully accomplished.    PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Not Available",

The very small vacuum tubes will have plate currents of 100 micro-amps at grid voltages of a few volts.  Individual micro-triodes could be connected together using modern semiconductormetalization methods to form extremely radiation tolerant high temperature processors.  Or the micro-triode array can be ganged together to form an extremely high power RF amplifier which has plate current of 1,000 amps/cm^2 and plate voltages in thekilovolt range.  Grid voltages on the order of tens of volts will control the current emission and potentially produce megawatts of power from a 1 cm^2 device.  During Phase I, the CVD diamond micro-tip emitter arrays were fabricated, tested in thelaboratory, and demonstrated to produce the current densities stated above.  The Phase II program will design, fabricate, package, test, and deliver CVD diamond micro-triodes capable of 100 watts at x-band with air cooling only.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Dynamically certified seats (16g seats) are being fielded in all jet transports certified since 1988. In addition, the airlines are steadily replacing their older seats with 16g compatible seats in the older aircraft certified prior to that date. The implementation of the dynamic seat requirements has encountered one unanticipated problem. Under normal use, seat cushions must be replaced with identical cushions every 3-5 years, and sometimes sooner. To maintain an aircraft's type certificate, the replacement seat cushions must be identical those installed for the original certification tests. Airlines are frequently unable to obtain identical replacement cushions. The airlines' only option, in this case, is to recertify the entire seat with a replacement cushion by conducting a full-scale 16g dynamic seat test. This is expensive since it not only requires the use of expensive laboratory equipment, but also because it destroys a seat frame. The best solution for this problem is the development of an inexpensive component test that can be used to certify replacement cushions. Such a test will provide a needed tool for the development of aircraft seats using a systems approach to crashworthiness and thus contribute to both safety and lower costs for the entire industry.",

A space radiator with high conductivity at low temperatures that is lightweight and has high stiffness is required. The opportunity presented in this Phase I proposal is to demonstrate a space radiator that will have high conductivity (>1800 W/mK) in the temperature region of interest (40K to 150K) and low density (< 2.0 g/cm3). Immediate payoffs include significant weight reductions and greater efficiency. This approach can also be used to improve the performance of low CTE optical benches; lightweight CTE matched heat spreaders for heat pipe evaporator and condenser ends, and thermal cores for electronic assemblies. These payoffs will allow for increased reliability and support the trend toward smaller less expensive satellites.The proposed material system is a macrocomposite comprised of thermal pyrolytic graphite (TPG) encapsulated within a carbon fiber composite structural shell. The pyrolytic graphite, TPG, is a unique form of graphite manufactured by decomposition of a hydrocarbon gas at high temperature in a vacuum furnace. TPG is highly aligned crystalline graphite with an in-plane thermal conductivity of 3000 W/mK at 120K. This is nearly 10 times the conductivity of copper. A radiator constructed of this material will provide high performance at a minimum weight.",

During Phase I, KaZaK Composites demonstrated tow important processtechnologies that improve the mechanical properties of structural elements used in deployable spacecraft booms.  First, we designed and implemented a unique tooling system that eliminates the minimum size constraint of conventional fabrication technologyassociated with increasingly small structural component size.  Second, we demonstrated a method that uses new tooling technology to produce very small, very detailed hybrid material structural elements that promise to significantly increase the performanceof composite elements used to make high performance carbon/phenolic precursor structure for carbon/carbon heat pipe tubing.  KCI has secured commitments for two aerospace firms to supply matching funds to make comparative parts using more conventionalfabrication technology and KCI's new process, then to test the candidate parts made with new and old technology to verify the suitability of the new process for the fabrication of spaceflight-acceptable composites.  KCI's new composite fabricationtechnology directly supports current aerospace coilable boom manufacturers by allowing them to meet projected needs for smaller masts that will be used in lighter, less expensive, future spacescraft systems.  It is also an enabling technology for thefabrication of next-generation spacecraft thermal control systems.  This same technology can be applied to the production of precursor for commercial composite components such as heat treating furnace structure.

While theconstruction materials embodied in this damper concept are more expensive than those in competing devices, there is very little touch labor in the fabrication and assembly of the KCI brace, making the installed cost competitive with existing products.  Thehigher weight-specific energy dissipation enabled by using advanced materials is therefore a bonus that may be especially useful in retrofit applications, where installation is more constrained by accessibility than new-build applications.The principal activities proposed for the Phase II project include scaling up the prototype brace designs of Phase I to full size, and testing representative examples both singly and in realistic steel-frame building configurations.  Additionally, we willcollaborate with an experienced construction engineering/consulting firm to develop a connection system that will be economical and straightforward in both design and installation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         We will conduct research on nutrition and food intake regulation mechanism in hybrid striped bass. We will determine: 1) how dietary energy density, satiated feeding, energy-to-protein ratios, fish size, and temperature affect food and energy consumption rates; 2) how \"high-energy\" diets can improve growth and feed conversion; and 3) how these diets affect fish health, effluent water quality, and shelf life of the final product. We also will establish an energy expenditure budget for hybrid striped bass to determine the required dietary energy necessary for growth, metabolism, and excretion. This integrated approach should lead to feed management strategies that result in significantly better and more cost-effective production strategies that can result from typical nutritional studies which emphasize growth rates alone. With a better understanding of these factors, we will be able to develop diets and feeding regimes which will increase production yield, improve water quality and decrease the cost of commercially-raised hybrid striped bass. It is possible that the least cost solution may prove to be one in which the maximum sustainable biogain, the net increase in fish biomass (in kg of fish per day), will not require the rapid fish growth rates sought by many researchers and producers.",

The proposed technique was conceptually demonstrated during Phase I laboratory experiments where the sensor reconstructed phase maps under highly scintillated conditions that could not accurately be reconstructed usingconventional wavefront sensors.  The Phase II testing will be done at the Lincoln Laboratory Advanced Concepts Laboratory in parallel with a conventional wavefront sensor to allow direct comparison between the two technologies and where the  sensor can becoupled to a deformable mirror.  The distorted grating wavefront sensing technique has the potential of overcoming existing shortfalls in wavefront sensing by providing increased accuracy, improved optical efficiency, and relaxed alignment requirements.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The Electronic Systems Command (ESC) of the U. S. Air Force has funded the development of a variety of C3I systems, raising concerns about excess cost and effort due to overlapping components and functionality. This concern motivated ESC to developschedulers by the product line approach. Our Planware project addresses the fact that the core functionality of scheduling is diverse, and that no small set of library components can hope to cover the range of Air Force scheduling needs and handle themwith acceptable performance and schedule quality.  Systems that solve complex problems will require more specialization than is possible from a library of source-code-level components.  Code components have many design decisions built-in, such as datastructure representations, algorithms, and interface communication mechanisms.  All too often these design decisions aren't optimal for a required usage context.  Our Planware project is based in the following insight: the essence of a code component liesin its abstract functionality, together with the abstract design knowledge that it embodies.  If abstract functionality can be formally specified, and abstract design knowledge can be formalized, then it is possible to generate components that fit a givenusage context by composing functionality and abstract design knowledge.",

The         expected advantages are:                                                                                                                                                  (1) It will allow the use of drugs designed solely for efficacy without              conjugation requirements.                                                            (2) It will allow the use of drugs designed solely for efficacy without regard       for solubility.                                                                      (3) Unconjugated drugs can be delivered as macromolecules and released within        the T cell.                                                                          (4) Drugs can be targeted by coupling the carrier to biorecognition molecules.                                                                                            These are advantages not currently available for treatment of MS.                                                                                                         Two carriers will be synthesized and compared for efficacy. One will have            mitoxantrone and the other cyclosporin an entrapped within it. The drug-loaded       carriers will be purified by gel chromatography. The carrying capacity,              stability, release activity, and T cell inhibition in vitro of each drug-loaded      carrier will be characterized.                                                       PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  Polymerized cyclodextrin drug carriers can expand long-term treatment options for MS.

It will guide security personnel in not only configuring their intrusion detection tools and developing mental models of attackers but also in effectively documenting patterns of attacks as they occur. This tool will be based on amodel of attacker behavior derived from a cognitive analysis of security personnel and skilled attackers, as well as from actual attacker behavior on a range of wargaming network configurations. Additionally, users will be able to document lessons learnedfrom attacks on their own systems, a noted shortcoming we discovered in our Phase I research.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION : (adapted from p.2 of proposal)This is a revised phase II               application concerned with developing a method of production of epithilone D.        Epothilones are polyketides isolated from the myxobacterium Sorangium                cellulosum that have shown great promise as anticancer agents. Although the two      compound classes are structurally unrelated, the mechanism of action,                stabilization of microtubules, is similar to that of paclitaxel (Taxol).             Epithilones are active against Taxol resistant cell lines, are effective             against multiple drug resistant cell lines, and are more water-soluble and thus      more easily administered than Taxol.                                                                                                                                      Because of these properties, one epithilone, epithilone D, has been chemically       synthesized, and is being considered for clinical evaluation. Yields are low,        both in the chemical synthesis and in the natural host organism. In phase I the      epithilone biosynthesis genes were cloned and sequenced, and expressed in the        fast growing heterologous host Streptomyces coelicor. A problem was that             expression of epithilone biosynthesis genes was toxic to this host. Phase 2          work seeks to first overcome or circumvent this toxicity. Following this, a          series of steps will be taken to maximize biosynthesis of Epithilone D.

        "abstract": "Abstract         60679       The DOE Fuel Cells for Buildings program is developing Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell system components for building cogeneration applications.  The system uses natural gas to produce a reformate, which is the feed gas to the fuel cell.  This reformate contains carbon monoxide (CO), which must be removed to prevent poisoning the fuel cell elements and the subsequent degradation of its performance.  This project will develop technology to remove the carbon monoxide and thus improve fuel cell performance.  Carbon monoxide will be reacted with hydrogen in the reformate to produce water-soluble products that can be scrubbed from the reformate by water and discarded without recycle.  This purification system would operate at mild conditions and consume minimal amounts of hydrogen.  Phase I established the technical feasibility of a novel catalytic technology for fuel cell reformate purification, achieving CO purification at temperatures from about 80 to 130C, and at pressures less than two atmospheres.  It was shown that CO concentrations could be reduced to 10 ppm at steady operating conditions and under 100 ppm at transient conditions.  The cost of the purification system appears compatible with the overall cost goal of $1500/kW for an installed PEM fuel cell system.  Phase II will optimize the catalysts for peak system performance, evaluate the catalysts under realistic reactive conditions, construct and test a larger prototype for design and demonstration, and conduct an economic evaluation of the technology.                         Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The technology should solve an important problem that currently restricts the application of fuel cells for building and transportation systems.  It should facilitate the commercialization of these fuel cell systems, and thus promote inexpensive, distributed sources of electricity generation, instead of large, central generators.",

The key novel component is a silicon microprobe, comparable in cross-section to a human hair,containing an integrated electrochemical lactate biosensor.  This biosensor microprobe protrudes subcutaneously from a small button-like device firmly affixed to the skin, continuously measures lactate, and a co-packaged telemetry chip transmits the datato a suitable receiver.  Silicon microprobes possessing high strength, flexibility, and fracture toughness are an advanced development from extensive MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) R&D; in the proposer's laboratory.  Integrating miniaturizedbiosensors into out unique silicon microprobes will produce low cost disposable continuous lactate monitors which are painless and easy to use.  The Phase I work to date has successfully miniaturized biosensors to an area of 1000 mm2, suitable forintegeration with silicon microprobes.  These new miniature biosensors can be placed onto a structure the size of a human hair, whereas existing biosensors are a thousand times larger.  The goal of Phase II is to improve performance of these lactatesensors, develop practical fabrication techniques, design and implement device packaging and attachment methods, and evaluate system performance by animal and human testing.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Optically transparent components for lasers, envelopes for vapor lamps andinfrared transparent domes for missiles require a multi-mode system ofelectromagnetic guidance. In recent years efforts have been concentrated onmaximizing the resolution of optical materials for use in high-energy lasersystems by minimizing the absorption of irradiated power and subsequentdeformation caused by heating. In order to prevent deformation from heating(improving the mechanical properties of the optical part) we suggested theuse of nanocrystalline aluminum oxynitride (a material which exhibits >80%in-line transmission between 0.3um and 6.0um) and lanthana strengthenedyttria (LSY -which has high transmission in the long wave infrared regionsof the electromagnetic spectrum) as transmissive optical materials. We weresuccessful in improving the mechanical properties of aluminum oxynitride andalso demonstrated that a rapid processing technique such as the plasmapressure consolidation could produce transmissive gamma-alum9ina (a materialrecently added to the already long list of transmissive components), opticalparts in <30 minutes form nancrystalline gamma-alumina powders.  In Phase II, we propose to bring innovations in both he synthesis and processing technologies in order to produce nanopowders in larger volumes (7Kg/batch), and use them to produce nearnet-shape, optically transparent 1 inch, 2 inch and 4 inch discs in <30 minutes. The parametric influence of both synthesis and processing technologies will be modeled using finite element technique. At the end of the Phases II program we will have a fullyoptimized process for producing rapid, cheap transmissive optics. We intendto deliver 10Kgs of nanopowders (y-A12O3, AION, and LSY) and 18 opticallytransparent discs to the US army space and Missile Defense Command,Huntsville-AL, for low and high power laser threshold testing.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to expose experimental rodents      to alcohol over periods of hours to days is crucial to research. At present,         the methods used to do so include repeated injections, feeding the animals a         liquid diet containing alcohol, or group-housing them in large chambers through      which alcohol vapors are circulated. The disadvantages of these methods include      the presence of a stressful procedure, an inadequate diet and/or the inability       to access individual animals while they are in the vapor environment. Under          Phase I, we developed a prototype that showed the feasibility of building            individual rat cages through which we could circulate known amount of alcohol        vapors. This system allowed us to develop charts which correlated blood alcohol      levels (BALs) to pre-determined parameters of alcohol delivery. Phase II will        expand the scientific ideas successfully explored under Phase I. As                  investigators use different rat strains, both males and females, and want to         treat their animals for several days, we will develop charts for male and            female (both virgin and pregnant) Sprague-Dawley, Wistar and Long-Evans rats.        This is necessary because alcohol metabolism varies between strains and              genders, and changes during pregnancy. Consequently we cannot assume that the        charts developed under Phase I are applicable to other models. We will also          modify the existing rat prototype so that the chambers can accommodate food          holders and water bottles, as well as outlets for cannulae, while the integrity      of the system is maintained during long-term housing. A stand holding syringes       and/or the recording instruments will be built, that fits over the chambers.         Finally, we found that mice housed in rat chambers had very heterogeneous BALs.      Therefore an important aspect of our work will consist in building chambers for      mice, a species that is increasingly used in alcohol research, but which will        require a redesign of the system to accommodate their smaller size. Once this        new design has been determined, we will develop charts correlating parameters        of alcohol delivery to target BALs in mice of three commonly used strains,           BALB/c, C57BL/6 and DBA/2. The finished rat and mouse products will represent a      very significant improvement over presently available systems. It will be            versatile, user-friendly and affordable. While originally designed for alcohol       work, we anticipate that it will be easily modifiable for other volatile,            non-corrosive substances, including those that are presently difficult to study      because they are highly toxic.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The monitoring and analysis of the structural integrity of buildings, bridges and machines is increasingly important as the average age of these structures increases and as buildings are built in more locations which are prone to natural disasters.Structural monitoring can be accomplished through the addition of a magnetostrictive material to structural members, either directly or through a composite.  Changes in the structure are reflected in stress-induced changes in the magnetic signature fromthe magnetostrictive material.  Microfluxgate sensors were demonstrated in Phase I to be capable of detecting such changes and to be suitable for integration with application specific integrated circuits (ASIC's) for inexpensive mass production.  In PhaseII, the ASIC will be produced and the microfluxgate integrated with it, resulting in a commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS) product.  An array of such integrated sensors will be fabricated and tested, and a hand-held reading instrument and a transducer will bedesigned and prototyped.  The transducer will be designed to be used with commercially available data transmission and collection instrumentation systems.  In Phase III, final structural monitoring equipment will be designed and deployed.  Commercialproducts will also be designed for non-structural markets.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Testing in a simulated environment is an essential feature of weapons system development. However, creating that environment can pose severe technical challenges. In the case of TV-guided munitions, the difficulty stems from the need to preserve dynamicimage fidelity with respect to a weapon's seeker; a task which is very different from creating imagery which appears realistic to the human eye, and which cannot be performed by conventional video display devices. Our novel FEISTI technology, however,provides artifact-free imagery with negligible flicker at any frequency. From a seeker's perspective, each pixel of a FEISTI-based image fades smoothly from one brightness level to the next; the result being analogous to natural light illuminating areal-world scene. Using this technology, we propose to develop a visible-spectrum scene projector which can be mounted upon a flight motion simulator and which can supply high-resolution imagery that is both flickerless and highly uniform. The Phase IIprogram will result in the development of a dual-use projector which satisfies the simulation requirements of the Air Force while, at the same time, providing the prototype of a common test set which can support the field testing of several weaponssystems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Power and brightness scaling of single-fiber lasers is limited by intrafiber damage intensity.  Hence, scaling to kW levels requires designs which coherently integrate the output of multiple fibers while, at the same time, avoiding nonlinear effects (suchas SBS) which limit the output power from a single fiber.  We have devised a technique whereby multiple fiber sources can be combined coherently to produce an output with an N-fold increase in power and with an N2-fold increase in brightness.  The specifictechnique involves a spectrally-tailored seed signal which feeds an array of equi-length fiber amplifiers.  By feeding all amplifiers from a common master, both synchronism in operating frequency and temporal coherence is achieved.  Each fiber amplifierincorporates a control element for precise control of the phase at its output; thereby allowing for synthesis of the required spatial phase front and, hence, the desired far-field beam profile.  Our approach toward achieving multi-kilowatt powers islargely insensitive to variation in fiber parameters, eliminates the need for precise control of multiple oscillators, suppresses parasitic nonlinear effects, and is infinitely scalable by virtue of its modularity.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Neural stem cells (NSCs) show a remarkable ability to migrate throughout the CNS, intermingle with host cells, and express foreign transgenes following transplantation. Intriguingly, this inherent migratory property of NSCs emulates the migratory pattern of some brain tumors, such as gliomas, characterized by invasive single cell migration. Potentially, the migratory properties of NSCs can be harnessed to disseminate therapeutic genes products to invading brain tumor cells. As the first step toward this goal, results from phase I studies demonstrated that human NSCs displayed significant tumor targeting migratory behavior toward gliomas while stable expressing a reporter gene. Phase II entails genetically modifying NSCs to express an array of therapeutic genes, and then assessing their potential to target tumor cells and elicit an anti-tumor response. It is anticipated that genetically modified NSCs will infiltrate the tumor mass, track individual tumor cells, and stably express oncolytic proteins that can destroy the cancerous cells in rodent models. These studies will advance the development of a potentially revolutionary treatment strategy using human NSCs as a novel, efficient delivery vehicle to target therapeutic genes to refractory brain tumors. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Neural stem cells represent a compelling new technology platform for the treatment of neurological diseases. Their natural migratory capacity provides a powerful vehicle to target therapeutic agents directly to refractory brain tumors. This project will evaluate an array of therapeutic genes to expedite the development of a potentially revolutionary cancer therapy strategy to treat deadly brain tumors.",

Phase I sought to identify and understand the technical challenges of the separation process and to, concurrently, seek plausible solutions in anticipation of a consolidated process research, development, optimization, demonstration, and scale up effort during Phase II.  The most significant accomplishment in Phase I was the simplification of the separation process based on the data collected.  Several material processing and handling steps were eliminated leading to time and cost savings.  Further, it was indicated that the simplified process would provide a higher yield.  Phase II will demonstrate and scale up the separation process for biobased succinic acid and develop a cost estimation and economic analysis for the process in preparation for commercialization.                  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The purpose of the overall R&D; effort is to develop a suit of generic technologies, including the separation process, that can be used to convert a low-cost fermentation product into a family of specialty chemicals with significant future markets.

Mass of the FSM mechanism is reduced by up to 25%. Simultaneous improvements in power consumption and lateral load capability are also featured. The first innovation involves the use of LHDC's efficient CS actuator technology for FSM actuation. Innovation #2 is the incorporation of advanced sensors having increased accuracy. The result is reduced mass, acceleration, and power as well as the improved accuracy of interferometric and optical encoder sensors without compromise to mirror surface figure quality. Benefits for JPL's ST-3 program include: improved global and small-range accuracy, lower cost than previous FSM, lower mass for lower launch costs and a simpler support structure. Line-of-sight stabilization can be done with only a few mW of actuator power and it can be launched without a mechanical caging mechanism for increased reliability. Additional benefits for other space-based applications include: extended travel, chopping or dither functions can be performed at higher frequencies and larger amplitudes with lower power for improved images.",

When they are used, available isolation systems provide less than 10 dB performance improvements relative to simple passivecomponents.  The industry needs a simple, compact, light, low-cost, high-performanceactive isolation option.The proposed concept is based on the principle of eliminating rigid links to the payload.  To achieve this, one must solve the problems associated with a disconnected payload.  These problems involve providing adequate caging for launch, landing or othertransportation loads.  Additionally, provisions must be made to prevent damage when unanticipated large-amplitude base motion occurs.  Further, signals must be transferred across the isolation gap with as little transmission of forces and torques aspossible.  Finally, non-contacting actuators with very high efficiency are needed to prevent excessive power consumption.  The solution involves robust mechanical stops, a eliable and robust caging mechanism, a reliable flexible umbilical cable andefficient non-contacting electro-magnetic actuators.  This combination of technologies promises a complete solution to this unique set of technical issues.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION: (Applicant's abstract) Many clinical/medical conditions, i.e,           neurological emergencies and disorders, require rapid intervention. Stroke is        one example. In this context, availability of medical devices can enhance            medical care to the patient.                                                                                                                                              Blood cell counters, which are used to count blood components such as red and        white blood cells, are ubiquitous in medicine as a diagnostic aid for disease        identification or as a general tool for many medical therapies. The pre-eminent      device in use today is the Coulter counter, which is expensive, large, and           generally not portable, requiring at least a desktop, household current supply       and a small support laboratory. The goal of this research and development            project is to design a prototype miniature blood cell counter for home-care, or      point-of-care analysis in doctors' offices, clinics, and hospitals.                   The novel blood counter we propose to develop is based on new, emerging              micromachine technologies, and would be approximately the size of a small            cell-phone, requiring very low electrical power. Similar to an inkjet print          head, which is also a product of micromachined fluidics technology, the core         analytical components of the miniature blood counter would be inexpensively          mass-produced. The cost per unit would be low enough that the analytical             portion could here placed after each use.                                            PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The proposed device has several likely economic advantages.  Firstly, it will reduce the  need for and cost of transport of blood samples to centralized laboratory.  Secondly,  expedient diagnosis will mean fewer clinical complications fewer office visits, shorter  hospital stays and possible a reduced need to transport patients.  It could result in an  overall savings of several million dollars annually.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         60170         Todays geothermal pressure/temperature measuring tools are short endurance, high value instruments used sparingly because their loss is a major expense.  This project will build and test a rugged, affordable downhole sensor capable of returning an uninterrupted data stream at pressures and temperatures of 10,000 psi and 250C, respectively, thus permitting continuous deep-well logging.  In Phase I, several prototype devices were constructed for laboratory testing.  Optical fiber assemblies were integrated into the  device in conjunction with a remote light source/photodetector/power supply module.  Laboratory evaluation of a prototype sensor established and reaffirmed the basic design and performance for measurement of pressure in a hostile environment.  Phase II provides for the further miniaturization and ruggedization of the device by the use of high temperature ceramic components.  In addition to providing field deployable devices, a coupled sensor array will be utilized to provide other relevant data at the well-head, including drilling force, flow, pressure and temperature.                    Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The sensor technology should have application for monitoring jet engine core pressure, petrochemical processes, hydraulics, heavy construction equipment, high pressure metal cutting, oceanography, nuclear power plants, injection molding, processing industries, and machine tools, as well as for mining and research organizations requiring similar gains in performance an reduced cost.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We are developing a new technology for          single molecule DNA sequencing based on the incorporation of dNTPs labeled on        the g-phosphate with fluorescent dyes. The label is cleaved from the nucleotide      along with pyrophosphate when the nucleotide is incorporated into DNA by a           polymerase. The released label is sorted from intact g-dNTPs in a microfluidics      system and is identified in real time by single molecule fluorescence detection      optics. In this proposal, we develop a novel nucleotide chemistry to enable the      sorting scheme and we use directed evolution methods to adapt polymerases for        utilization of the g-dNTPs. Single molecule sequencing promises to reduce the        cost of DNA sequencing by several orders of magnitude compared to current            methods.    PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS:  A genomic DNA sequencing technology that reduces cost and eliminates the need for cloning,    physical mapping and electrophoresis would have great appeal to both the academic and  industrial genomic research communities.",

Scheduled reduced smoking holds promise for decoupling the associations,             achieving uncommonly high efficacy scores. Delivery of a personalized treatment      schedule requires a programmable electronic device. This company developed a         device that delivers a tailored reduction schedule, records smoking events in        real time, and provides constant usage feedback. The device is easy to use,          convenient, inexpensive, unobtrusive, and able to record data continuously, 24       hours per day. Phase I research tested the effectiveness of the device in            aiding smoking cessation against a no-treatment control group. Treatment             participants achieved significantly higher 7-day abstinence than did control         subjects. In Phase II, we propose to enhance the capabilities of the device          with electronic communications capability. Devices will automatically upload         usage data to a remote computer for analysis.

Nonplanar ring oscillators (NPROs) are the baseline technology for these systems. NPROs can reach the 1-Watt power required for proposed systems. However, we believe that a system built around a single, high-power NPRO is not the best design. An approach which will have lower linewidth, and lower power consumption, is a low-power NPRO amplified to a power of 1-Watt and greater by an Ytterbium-doped fiber amplifier (YDFA.) The advantages of an oscillator / amplifier configuration, compared to the conceptually simpler high-power oscillator, are that the frequency stability of lower-power oscillators is better than that of higher-power oscillators, and that Ytterbium fiber amplifiers are about twice as efficient as Neodymium oscillators, primarily because they do not require active cooling of pump diodes. An amplified system would have the good linewidth of the low-power NPRO, but with the low power consumption of the Ytterbium fiber amplifier. The goal of the proposed research program would be to experimentally demonstrate a laser source with the power, frequency stability and efficiency needed for use in a space-borne interferometer.",

In particular Phase I proved that there are components available today with therequired power, space, electrical and optical characteristics that can packaged on PCI form factor card to create terabit range networks with QoS and convergence.This proposed Phase 2 under the Fast Track Program is to design and develop the products envisioned at the earliest so that Lightel can provide the very first end-to-end WDM network solutions, beginning with the Web server farms for the next generationnetworks and then extending the solution to LANs and WANs. To create such end to end network solutions we propose to design and develop a Network Interface Card (also called a Host Adapter Board), a Bridge or Transit Card to inter operate with othertechnologies like Fiber Channel and Gigabit Ethernet, and a Switch product to extend networking solutions to LANs and WANs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The incandescent lamps used in the green threshold lamps that form a line on the front end of an airport runway, have relatively short lives and require constant maintenance.  The green filters used in front of the lamps transmit only about 20% of the light.  Green light emitting diodes (LEDs) have been improved recently and are reaching brightness levels making it possible to use them in traffic lights.  The red ones are already widely used in traffic lights.  Our goal is to develop LED replacements for the incandescent threshold lights.  Circuits that will avoid having to rewire the system will be devised.  The advantage of LEDs is very long life, high reliability, freedom from sudden failur and low power consumption.",

The cells will be discharged atDelta III and IV launch vehicle (LV) discharge regimes and a variety of abuse, 60 and 70 C activated storage tests will be carried out.   Calculations from extensive experimental data show that 40 Ahr Li/CuCl2 cells in a lightweight case could deliver 202Whr/kg at a full 40 Amp discharge and 2 second 250 A pulses above 2.10 V.  Nine Li/CuCl2 cells would replace 19 AgO/Zn cells in a 30.5 V LV battery  with 52% less space.    About 40% of the Phase II effort will involve a technology development task that will include work to (i) semi-optimize an oxidation resistant shutdown separator that contains a fuse material that will melt at 100 C  shutting down a 40 Ahr cell, (ii)devise new technology to totally contain SO2 inside a sealed battery box in case a cell vents and (iii) to discover and develop new transition metal halide positive electrodes capable of over 350 Whr/kg.   Electronic circuits and software to charge ninecell Li/CuCl2 batteries will also be developed.",

Our objective in Phase II will be to demonstrate aviable thin film, small area (0.5 x 0.5 cm x 5-10 micron thin), multi-voltage, lithium rechargeable polymer electrolyte battery stack, that delivers at least 100% more of the present energy density of existing state-of-the-art lithium ion batteries andgreater than 40-50% improvement in the rate capability and cost through the use of novel, ultra-thin, stable, polymer electrolytes and electrodes and ultra-thin current collectors with cycle life exceeding several thousand of cycles under deep dischargeconditions and several other improvements foreseen in performance. Key areas include, a room temperature polymer electrolyte battery exceeding 250 Wh/kg, the development of new electrode structures, higher conducting polymer electrolytes, and ability tofabricate multi-voltage batteries in high speed, low cost and any capacity.",

The major obstacles in the development of the farm-raised live bait shrimp industry are the need for domesticated pathogen-free postlarvae (PL), the lack of reliable marketing information and the elimination of effluent discharge. The proposed study seeks to overcome these problems through meeting the Phase II objectives. The first objective will include closing the life cycle of Farfantepenaeus aztecus and F. duorarum using techniques developed during the Phase I efforts. Offspring to be produced from these populations will help future development of genetically improved seedstock. The second objective will focus on the development of a closed recirculating larvae rearing system aimed to reduce/eliminate effluent discharge from commercial hatcheries. The third objective will include a comprehensive survey of the Texas retail market for live bait shrimp to streamline supply of farm-raised live bait shrimp. Overcoming these obstacles will enable Long Star Farm to develop a reliable commercial live bait shrimp production center for native species during Phase III.",

This project will develop new fieldable instrumentation that can make these determinations at a site in real time, and transmit the information to monitoring personnel in real time via wireless internet communication.   In Phase I, the new technique was demonstrated in the wavelength range (infrared) where the instrument will function.  Also, a detailed design for the entire package was developed.  In Phase II, two parallel efforts will be initiated to develop both the sensor instrument package as well as the remote field packaging.

To fill the present and future void in high-speed mobile connectivity and user location, we propose to developa multi-technology mobile computing platform that allows untethered network access at high data transfer rates.  The results of the Phase II effort will be a pair of mobile computing interfaces that can communicate at speeds up to 100 Mbps and that wouldbe able to be integrated into future IO and C2 environments, thus permitting worldwide, real-time, distributed collaborative information exchange in support of operational decision making.

        "abstract": "Abstract         In aircraft gas turbine engines, in most cases, the blades areheld in rotating disks by a dovetail attachment that fits into amatching slot in the rim of the disk.  The contact area betweenthe blade dovetail and the dovetail slot is subject to vibrationand high stresses, leading to fretting conditions.  Eventually,fretting fatigue cracks initiate in the fretting area andpropagate into the disk and/or dovetail slot, and as a consquence,the blades and disks are retired for cause.  This is a significantproblem.  The application of a soft metallic coating to the bladedovetails helps to decrease this problem, but recoating and theeventual retirement of blades and disks for fretting damageremains a significant cost.  This program will evaluate thefeasibility of using laser peening to increase the resistanceblade dovetails and dovetail slots to fretting fatigue damage andfailure.  Two issues will be addressed.  One, the magnitude of thebeneficial effect of laser peening to increase the frettingfatigue life associated with dovetail fretting will be evaluated. Two, methods for laser peening the inside fretting surface ofdovetail slots will be evaluated.  The evaluation will considerlower cost, ease of use, reliability, and maintainability ofhardware.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Freestanding metallized polyimide films have become a standard for soft x-ray filters. The strength and thermal stability of polyimide has been used to advantage in producing increasingly larger and thinner filters. To continue this trend and to improve the durability and throughput of filters for current instruments, it is proposed to develop a new generation of freestanding thin film filter designs by incorporating multilayer techniques. Multilayer films consist of hundreds or thousands of alternating layers, and can be considerably stronger than the component materials. To use this technique for building optical filter foils, the polyimide fabrication process must be changed from a solution-cast method to vapor deposition. Vapor depositing polyimide could have several advantages in x-ray filter fabrication. It would permit the ultrathin layering required for multilayer film construction and would reduce film contamination resulting from vacuum cycling. The use of vapor deposition to produce freestanding polyimide/metal multilayer films may result in even stronger and thinner soft x-ray filters, which would allow larger and higher-performance instruments to be realized.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Small Business Innovation Research         Phase II project is concerned with the design and development of a new, direct       method for determination of ozone C.t values in disinfection processes.              According to a recent report to Congressional committees, many public health         experts believe that the risk for food-borne illness is increasing. While ozone      has excellent potential as an environmentally friendly yet highly powerful           disinfecting agent, there are problems associated with ozone measurement, and        therefore the sufficient disinfection of foods. During Phase I, a fundamentally      new litmus paper-type method for determination of ozone C.t values, was              developed through the impregnation of FDA approved dyes on common filter paper.      Phase I testing of the developed Disinfection Verification Strips demonstrated       the viability, repeatability, and robustness of this method for ascertaining         the difficult-to-measure C.t value in ozone disinfection processes.                                                                                                       During the Phase II studies, a series of technical and scientific questions          will be addressed, leading to targeted color and C.t ranges for use in specific      food applications. Further, testing of Disinfection Verification Strips in           actual food disinfection processes, through collaboration with industrial            partners, will lead toward establishment of a diverse selection of standardized      quality monitoring strips.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Cryptosporidium, originating from contamination of public drinking water supplies, ponds, rivers, or swimming pools, have cause large-scale and deadly outbreaks, which became a major cause of waterborne infectious diseases. Since 1991, the percent of outbreaks attributable to Cryptosporidium has doubled, and in the 1993-1994 period, 17 percent of all outbreaks were caused by Cryptosporidium. In 1996, 42 states reported 2,426 cases to the Centers for Disease Control. Such outbreaks prompted EPA to establish new regulations for monitoring raw and finished water systems. For instance, EPA's Information Collection Rule and Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule require that all large public water systems routinely conduct microbiological monitoring of raw and finished waters. Smaller utilities are likely to face compliance deadlines before 2004. Even though EPA's current recommended detection limit is 10 oocysts/L, the Agency likely will impose stricter requirements in the future. The currently available method for detection of Cryptosporidium oocysts, Method 1622, is very laborious, yields poor oocysts recovery, cannot be performed in the field, and needs highly trained professionals to accurately perform the analysis. This fluorescent microscopy-based method is strongly affected by nonspecific fluorescence by other organisms and chlorine compounds present in the sample. The proposed new method is based on two innovations, one which utilizes (di)electrophoretic separation, concentration, and focusing of Cryptosporidium oocysts in a microfluidic sensor, and the other using on-chip polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and electrochemical detection of DNA amplicons. The Phase I results clearly demonstrated the feasibility of electrical separation of Cryptosporidium oocysts as well as an enhanced and highly sensitive method for electrochemical detection of Cryptosporidium DNA amplicons. The results indicated that the full system development would provide competitive detection limits for in-field testing of oocysts and cysts. The Phase II project will further optimize the design parameters for separation and detection systems. A prototype microfluidic analyzer with on-chip PCR detection will be designed, built, and thoroughly tested. It is planned to perform an interlaboratory comparison of results obtained using the proposed method and the current EPA Method 1622/1623. Because of the simplicity of the design of new PCR primers and selective recognition of characteristic DNA templates, the proposed microfluidic analyzer will find a large number of applications in detection of other microorganisms in the field or on production lines, e.g., in food, chemical, environmental, or biotechnological industries. The same principles could be used for detection of cells in biological fluids; thus, the analyzer offers numerous biomedical and pharmaceutical applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Verbatim from the Applicant's Abstract): 213Bi is a short-lived,        alpha-emitting radionuclide that has been identified as an ideal isotope for         the treatment of leukemia and other micrometastatic cancers. Clinical                applications of this isotope are currently hindered by the limited supply of         high purity 213Bi. The preferred method of supply is in the form of a generator      in which 225Ac is immobilized on an ion exchange column and 213Bi is eluted as       required. Current generators use organic ion exchange resins that are                susceptible to radiation damage, leading to column blocking and/or the release       of pyrogens and 225Ac into the 213Bi product. This proposal will design,             construct and test an advanced, automated generator using radiation-resistant        inorganic ion exchange materials. The generator will also produce the 213Bi          product in a form suitable for the rapid synthesis of 213Bi                          radiopharmaceuticals. Existing generators typically produce the Bi product in        HI or HCl solutions, which require multi-step processing to manufacture              radiopharmaceuticals. This state-of-the art generator will fuel research in the      fledgling field of alpha-emitters in cancer treatment by improving the               reliability of the 213Bi generators, producing pure 213Bi in a suitable form         for radiopharmaceutical manufacture and increasing the availability of 213Bi to      cancer researchers.                                                                  PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:   It is envisioned that the generator will be used at medical research centers and hospitals  to treat patients with cancers, such as leukemia and ovarian cancer.  It will allow alpha  therapy to be performed routinely with confidence that the 213Bi product will be pure and   amenable for radiopharmaceutical processing.  The automated generator design will also  be amenable to other generator systems currently in use (e.g., 99Mo/99Tc).",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Phase II SBIR proposal describes an innovative towelette for the decontamination of organophosphorous nerve agents from skin, wounds, and other sensitive surfaces of exposed military personnel.  The towelette consists of a cotton fabric on which isimmobilized an Organophosphate Hydrolase (OPH) that has been demonstrated to hydrolyze Sarin, Soman, Tabun, VX, and Russian-VX.  In Phase I, this novel towelette was prepared and was shown to hydrolyze a variety of nerve agent surrogates.  In addition, thetowelette retained activity when stored at elevated temperature for weeks.  The towelette was also used to decontaminate an artificial surface contaminated with a nerve agent surrogate and in a separate, preliminary experiment, the towelette was shown notto produce any redness, swelling, and/or irritation when applied to human skin for 24 hours. Acetycholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) were also immobilized on the towelette demonstrating the compatibility of the coupling chemistry withother enzymes.In Phase II, Lynntech, Inc. will collaborate with Texas A&M; University and the Battelle Memorial Institute to further develop and evaluate the decontamination towelette.  Phase II tasks include immobilization of a cocktail of enzymes including OPH, AChE,and BChE and optimization of the towelette activity.  Phase II tasks also include optimization of the stability of the towelette, immunogenicity testing of the towelette, and decontamination of live rabbit skin contaminated with either Sarin, Soman, or VX.The Phase II research will conclude with the delivery of 100 OPH towelettes to the Department of Defense for further testing and evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         It is estimated that there are approximately 300 million tires discarded each year in the United States and this is in addition to the 800 million scrap tires that reside in landfills and tire dumps throughout the country. About 180 million are recycled, and the remaining 120 million scrap tires are discarded (legally or illegally) in landfills or tire dumps. Current tire reuse technologies offer a considerable opportunity to generate valuable materials from what is essentially worthless scrap. There are significant market barriers preventing these technologies from reaching their economic potential. Considering all of the potential markets for crumb rubber as a polymer filler, the one with the greatest potential is the production of rubber pavements. However, inconsistencies in the quality of the final pavement have resulted in a decrease in popularity. During the Phase I effort, Lynntech successfully demonstrated a low-temperature process to generate surface modified crumb rubber. Addition of the chemically activated crumb rubber was shown to solve many of the problems associated with rubber pavement production. This new asphalt has improved settling characteristics, resistance to fatigue, and resistance to thermal cracking. The asphalt also had better high-temperature viscosity and the curing time was reduced by half compared to traditional crumb rubber blends. During the Phase II effort, Lynntech will expand on the scope of Phase I by building and testing a field deployable crumb rubber treatment system and, for proof of concept, Lynntech will use the treated crumb rubber to lay a test section of highway. The potential for success is high. Lynntech will be working with the Center for Asphalt and Materials Chemistry at Texas A&M; University. The Center is recognized world wide for its advances in asphalt chemistry and has developed several formulations that have been used on several sections of highway in Texas.The commercial potential for this technology is enormous. Foresight Science and Technology performed an independent economic evaluation on the use of ozone-treated crumb rubber for pavement construction. The domestic market alone was estimated at $15 million for the first year of operation, increasing to $120 million after 5 years. During the course of the evaluation, Lynntech and Foresight have identified several other lucrative markets including automotive rubber products (tire retreads, hoses, belts, etc.), protective matting, and soil amendments. Lynntech has already identified several potential commercial partners who have invested resources into commercialization of this technology.",

This project will develop a portable, versatile analyzer for automated, high-throughput analysis of clinically important drugs and proteins in biological fluids such as blood and urine.  The approach is based on new micro/nano fluidics technology that can be used to analyze large biomolecules in complex sample matrices, combining molecular recognition and signal transduction in a single element.  Phase I demonstrated highly specific recognition of large protein molecules using two new types of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIP).  A unique electrical signal transduction system was developed to sense the specific binding interactions between the analyte molecule and the MIP sensing element.  Phase II will optimize the MIPs affinity toward selected, clinically important drugs and proteins, and develop protocols for their detection in biological fluids.  Phase II also will provide optimization and testing of the design and fabrication of a prototype, micro/nano fluidic device capable of analyzing multiple samples and multiple proteins using an array of sensing elements /tranducers.

Recent advances in electroanalytical stripping analysis using novel electrode conditioning procedures has led to great improvements in sensitivity and resolution for trace metal monitoring.  However, long term field deployment of these sensors is not practical because of electrode instabilities and limited sensitivities.  This project will develop and field test a novel submersible micro lab, using a microband electrode array with individually addressable sensor elements, for long term remote monitoring and characterization of ground water sites contaminated with hazardous metal waste.  In Phase I, an electrochemical microband sensor array was successfully designed and tested for the simultaneous detection of trace metal contaminants.  10-mm diameter electrodes were fabricated using lithographic and contact printing approaches.  The  electrodes exhibited superior adhesion and electrical properties, and the long-term stability and chemical specificity of the electrodes was demonstrated.  Furthermore, ppb levels of Cr(VI) detection were achieved for groundwater samples obtained from the 100D Area of the DOE Hanford site.   Phase II will optimize the fabrication methods, increase the sensitivity of electrochemical detection, and build a working unit for in situ field testing of a conducting polymer-based sensor array.                   Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The number of contaminated sites in the U.S. has been estimated in the hundreds of thousands.  Characterization of these sites can cost between 0% and 40% of the total remediation cost, with the average being 15%.

Removal of ammonium ions from the effluent stream from 1000 ppm to less than 0.25 ppm is an imperative need as a part of the space life support infrastructure. Drawbacks associated with processes proposed in the past include the generation of a secondary waste, cost, size, and/or the use of consumables that need to be stored or supplied. The proposed technology is based on an innovative, environmentally friendly electrochemical process for the effective removal of ammonium ions. It does not use consumables but oxygen gas from air, readily available. It will not generate a secondary waste. By controlling operational conditions, the ammonium ions will be transformed to nitrogen gas, which can be removed from the liquid phase in microgravity conditions by the use of a gas separation module. In addition, it is an energy efficient process, operates at room temperature, and is microgravity compatible. The purpose of Phase I is to demonstrate the feasibility of the electrochemical oxidation of the ammonium ions to nitrogen gas and to test its efficiency using a bioreactor effluent simulant.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project describes an innovative combinatorial approach to the discovery of new electrocatalysts for electrochemical ozone generation. Ozone is increasingly being used in water treatment, as a sanitizing agent in the food industry and is preferred over chlorine and its derivatives. Electrochemical ozone generation, where ozone is generated by electrolysis of water, can potentially offer several cost and process advantages over the conventional electrical discharge methods of ozone generation. However, existing methods for generating ozone electrochemically use electrodes, which offer low Faradaic (i.e., current) efficiencies and have limited materials stability. In Phase I, ozone electrocatalysts were screened using a combinatorial approach, and two novel electrocatalysts for ozone formation were identified. A new rapid screening approach was also devised and will be used to evaluate focussed combinatorial arrays in Phase II. Phase II will identify the precise stoichiometries of the new ozone electrocatalysts using the techniques pioneered in Phase I. The catalysts will then be synthesized on a macro scale and evaluated in ozone cells using existing ozone electrocatalysts as a benchmark. The catalysts identified during this project will enable a more cost-effective generation of ozone with applications in municipal water treatment, point-of-entry and point-of-use water treatment, food sanitation, medical waste treatment and medical sterilization. Ozone could also be utilized in the chemical industry as a replacement for chlorine in a variety of processes, e.g. paper and pulp bleaching.",

These systems will integrate food production with atmosphere regeneration and water recycling, increasing self-sufficiency and decreasing the need for expensive resupply from earth. Since maintaining crew health is of utmost importance, food must be produced and processed under highly sanitary conditions to minimize the risk of food borne diseases. New sanitation methods and procedures are urgently needed to meet this challenge. This proposal concerns the use of a new, totally enclosed vapor phase sterilization system. The device is unique because it operates without using consumable chemicals carried on board or resupplied from earth. The disinfectant that is generated acts against a broad range of potentially pathogenic microorganisms and it is generally safe to apply directly to foods. The disinfectant can also be externally applied to utensils, food preparation surfaces and processing equipment and there are no harmful wastes produced that could impact an integrated bioregenerative system. The proposal includes preliminary test results demonstrating the devices operating characteristics. The aim of Phase I is to demostrate the methods feasibility as a food sanitizing agent. The long-term goal is to provide sanitation hardware to NASA for use in food processing.",

Keeping a solar powered aircraft aloft through the night, requires storing surplus electric power during the day for use at night. A lightweight proton exchange membrane (PEM) high pressure unitized regenerative fuel cell (URFC) operating as an electrolyzer during the day to convert hydrogen into electricity and as a fuel cell to generate electricity at night offers the means for achieving this. Current configurations for URFCs are either complex or inadequate to achieve the desired energy density. The URFC proposed here uses a unique oxygen electrode design. This electrode uses a mixed (Pt and IrO2-RuO2) electrocatalyst with components optimized for both oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions. These electrodes are used in conjunction with a novel gas diffusion structure based on a conductive oxide matrix with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions arranged to optimize both gas and water transport in both electrolyzer and fuel cell modes to produce superior performance.",

This project will develop an affinity inorganic membrane that can demonstrate separations based upon affinity while still maintaining its material stability under harsh environments.  The membrane will be formed with a unique type of inorganic material (with a specific affinity to CO2) that will be supported on porous ceramic substrates.  In addition to CO2 affinity, the membrane will not exhibit the hydrothermal stability deficiencies of existing microporous inorganic membranes, seen in many industrial applications.  In Phase I, several membranes were prepared and enhanced CO2 transport was demonstrated.  Preliminary surface characterization results indicated that the intrinsic hydrothermal stability of this inorganic material was excellent.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The capability to precisely locate and identify radio frequency (RF) threats in real time is critical for warfighter system of systems environments that utilize multiple sensors. Developmental radar warning sensors such as the Precision Location andIdentification (PLAID) and special receiver collection systems determine precise threat location or identify by making extremely accurate parameter measurements of Doppler/phase shifts, angle-of-arrival (AOA), and time difference of arrival (TDOA).Open-air ranges cannot provide dense emitter environments, nor the controlled, repeatable conditions essential for valid and affordable testing. Current DOD laboratory testing facilities and commercial simulations cannot simulate all the detailed, finegrain signal characteristics required to effectively test PLAID technologies. Innovative simulation concepts are required that can generate appropriate RF signal modulations with an accuracy/resolution exceeding the measurement capability of PLAID sensors.This Phase II SBIR will develop and build a creative design concept called the Advanced TDOA, AOA, and Phase (ATAP) threat simulation that addresses the critical technology challenges of testing PLAID sensors. A prototype ATAP system, as designed in thePhase I will be fabricated and demonstrated in the AFRL/SN Integrated Demonstrations and Applications Laboratory (IDAL). Phase II will result in a simulator prototype single channel design, that is readily expandable into a multi-channel system withpotential applications as a commercial product. ATAP will have a high payoff by reducing development risk and testing cost by enabling rapdi prototyping of hardware design and softeware algorithms in a controlled environment.  ATAP is adaptable tocommercial Automated Test Equipment (ATE) applications to test Air Traffic Control Systems, Microwave Landing Systems (MLS), cellulat telephones, Global Position (GPS), and VHF/UHF communications. It is also useful as a commercial tool for testing ECM/ESMsystems in aircraft (B-2, F-15, F-22, etc.) integration laboratories. With high gain amplifiers and antennas, ATAP has applications in open air range testing, and EW combat simulation and training.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In Phase II, we will develop a fully            automatic, high-throughput, low-cost, multi-sample mRNA purification instrument      and disposable sample cassettes. Unlike any other process currently available        for mRNA purification, this instrument uses a derivative of the electrophoretic      separation technology that was previously developed by our company for DNA           purification in conjunction with a novel mRNA separation method and collection       process. The separation technique is powerful in that can be performed with the      combination of a multi-channel, disposable sample cassette and an inexpensive        processing instrument. The availability of this instrument and its supplies          will save countless hours of medical and biological research in labs that            currently perform manual mRNA isolation. In Phase I, we tested this automated        method and showed that it satisfactorily purified multiple samples of mRNA in        less than 30 minutes. We showed that the purification method could be used on a      wide range of starting cell numbers or tissue weights and still yield highly         pure, biologically active mRNA.                                                                                                                                           The instrument that we will research and develop in Phase II will purify mRNA        directly from the cell or tissue lysate by a fully automated, two step               procedure that can process up to 96 samples in parallel. The instrument is           projected to cost less than $10,000 to the end user, with disposable costs of        $1.5 per sample. These features will make the instrument at least two times          faster and half the cost per sample of any automated product currently               available. The instrument will be several times less expensive than competitor       products, and thus affordable to smaller labs.                                       PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The methods and products developed in this work will be commericalized by MacConnell  Research Corp. in the form of instruments and disposable cassettes that can be marketed  to the 50,000 molecular biology laboratories worldwide.  These products will greatly   enhance the capability of researchers studying genetic disease, viral infection and   cellular mechanisms at the molecular level.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         To overcome the problems and performance limitations of traditional electronic compass designs and to achieve better performance at a lower cost, an innovative, simpler, more robust magnetic heading sensor is being developed.  The approach is based on thethesis that heading sensor accuracy can be made better (and the heading sensor less complex and expensive) than traditional electronic compass designs. The approach employs the scanning magnetic angle comparator (SMAC) technique, which offers distinctadvantages over conventional electronic compasses, because there are additional degrees of freedom to optimize performance by using feedback via a microprocessor to minimize error. During Phase I, an extensive error model analysis was performed.  Theanalysis predicted an achievable accuracy of 0.1-degrees at 30-degrees latitude. The design study demonstrated the feasibility of implementing a precision, solid-state, non-inertial, self-calibrating heading sensor at a production cost of under $1,000using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) magnetic sensors and electronic components. During Phase II, a prototype -- 0.875-incles diameter and approximately 4.0-inches long -- will be developed.  (A 0.5-inches in diameter unit for use in ThinLine towed arrayshas been proposed as an option.)  At the end of Phase II, a SMAC heading sensor will be available for testing on an AUV.",

A quick release axle mounting system allowed installation of      Magic Wheels on 50 percent of the test subjects' personal wheelchairs without        an adapter or modification.                                                                                                                                               Phase II will allow us to bring the 2-speed wheels closer to market. This            funding will cover the redesign of the product to optimize manufacturability,        functionality and user friendliness. Additional wheel mounting adapters will be      designed to accommodate a large number of existing wheelchair models.                Computerized Finite Element Analysis (FEA) will be used to minimize component        weight. Bridge tooling will be used to build 50 sets of 2-speed wheels for           extensive clinical testing I evaluation.                                                                                                                                  The clinical test program (in year two) will: 1) measure attributes of the           two-speed wheels in every day living situations and 2) demonstrate, both             quantitatively and qualitatively, improved mobility in ramp climbing /               descending from 1:12 slope (normal wheelchair ramp) to 1:4 slope (very steep,        not climbable with standard wheelchair).                                             PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  Our goal is to greatly enhance the mobility of the over 1.2 million people (US) who live in  manual wheelchairs and to have our two-speed manual wheels become the preferred  wheel for special grade wheelchairs.  The demonstrated ability of Magic Wheels to be   installed easily on most existing manual wheelchairs should allow fast penetration of the  wheelchair wheel market through a multi-level sales program (including Internet sales).  Market research indicates a 5 year potential to grow a $30-50 million per year company  (employing over a hundred people) selling the two-speed wheels and related products.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The goal of the proposed SBIR Phase 2 program is to demonstrate a new magnetic detection platform technology in a next generation instrument that is capable of performing ultra-sensitive homogeneous assays for a wide range of analytes. The novel magnetic detection system will take advantage of major advances in high-temperature (high-Tc) SQUID sensors that enables the quantitative measurements of a small number of magnetic labels. We will develop a prototype instrument that is targeted at detection in the sub-attomolar range. While the sensitivity is a major strength, we will also focus on demonstrating a homogeneous format capability and an ability to work with small volumes of analyte, both of which are important for high throughput screening. We will perform head-to-head comparisons of magnetic immunoassays on cytokines with established detection techniques. We will additionally investigate the suitability of the instrumentation to the very important area of DNA probes. In theory, the sensitivity is so great that the potential exists to provide a simple and efficient alternative to PCR or other target amplifications systems. The commercial impact of this detection technology platform is enormous and ranges from high throughput screening for drug discovery to the clinical diagnostic DNA probe market. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Our goal is to develop a bench-top magnetic immunoassay detector to meet the needs of research and clinical laboratories where high sensitivity is required and existing techniques are limited by cost, throughput, sensitivity, or toxicity. While the initial instrument to be developed is targeted at a sizable research market, this new immunoassay system has potential to compete in many segments of the much larger ($5 billion/year world-wide) commercial clinical market. In addition the sensitivity of this technology may ultimately allow us to perform DNA analysis without performing a PCR amplification step and would find significant commercial and research application.",

This prototype system will be extensively tested anddemonstrated to measure performance parameters such as power consumption, cooling capacity, system size and mass, and oter key parameters. Finally, the performance information will be used to develop a preliminary design of a system for a future flightexperiment.  There are both military and commercial applications for the low-lift heat pump space craft thermal control system. Military applications include conventinal satellites, space-based radar, space-based laser, and other high-power space-basedweapon and surveillance systems. Commercial applications include larger commercial satellites for communications, surveillance and other applications.",

Mainstream'sfirst prototype satisfied this requirement early in Phase I.  Asecond-generation prototype was then developed with reducedengine block size and weight.  A third-generation prototype willbe completed in the Phase I Option that substitutes magnesium foraluminum in the engine block.  Magnesium is stronger thanaluminum and will reduce engine block weight another 33%.  Thediesel engine has a shaft output of 2.8 kW and can thereforegenerate more than 2.24 kW electrical power (80% alternatorefficiency).  The first, second, and third generation totaldiesel generator weights are 42.1, 40.7, and 36.5 lbs,respectively.  Having exceeded Marine Corps operationalrequirements in Phase I, pre-production development and extensivelife testing of the third-generation engine will be completed inthe Phase I Option.  Phase II will focus on demonstrating thereliability and maintainability of the diesel engine, optimizingthe alternator, fabricating a reduced-cost production version,and field testing by the user.",

This effort will be performed in parallel with a cost-matched Fast-Trackprogram to develop the compact oxygen generation system with a demonstration of the completed system  in 24 months.We have already demonstrated that this technology is superior to all current and proposed solutions to provide compact cryocooling, and the unique multi-level cooling of this configuration further minimizes the cooling load at the coldest temperature,further reducing the size of the system.

Large volume pricing will be less than $4000 per unit. Two months of Phase I effort have demonstrated conclusively thefeasibility of three critical technical objectives, generating strong commercial interest. Confidence is high that the remaining objectives will be achieved during the final four months of Phase I. The optical scanning is generated by rotation of arefractive element, giving excellent immunity to vibration. The electronics incorporate a novel architecture based on a digital signal processor, facilitating powerful data processing and sensor network applications. The reference laser is an inexpensive,highly efficient semiconductor, stabilized for part-per-million wavenumber calibration by an inexpensive quartz etalon.This instrument is particularly suitable for field applications, including standoff and point detection of chemical and biological contamination, as well as remote sensing from aircraft. Special versions will be capable of 1000 scans per second withresolution-limited throughput. Commercial applications include a wide range of process and quality control, laboratory research, field measurements and remote sensing. The modularity makes it readily configurable for a variety of applications. The highperformance characteristics and inherent low cost ensure a significant market share.",

Here we propose to develop and commercialize a  relatively new family of local probes capable of performing  electromagnetic measurements with nearly atomic resolution over a wide  frequency range covering up to 100 GHz. Potential applications of these so  called near-field or evanescent probes (EMP) are in surface science,  chemical sensing, molecular electronics and molecular spectroscopy,  biological studies, quantum computing, IC industry and manufacturing  quality control to name a few. Composed of a co-planar wave-guide  terminated by an AFM compatible cantilever beam with a co-axial tip, these  EMP's were designed and tested during a Phase I SBIR and the current  proposal is to optimize the performance and fabrication technology. To  facilitate their wide spread use by the SPM community, we will also  develop a microwave instrumentation unit (MIU) that can be used to  retrofit commercial SPM units and enable them to use our EMP's for  microwave imaging of various specimens. We will also develop, design and  fabricate a variety of calibration samples as standards for EMP  calibration and quantification of its output signal. We have estimated  that about 100 laboratories around the world would be interested in an  add-on package and would be valued at $20000 for a total of $2,000,000.  The market for replacement tips would be about 5000 tips at $100 per tip  for a total market of $500,000 per year.",

Public service officials, military personnel, educators and medical professionals need to be able to communicate with anever-increasing non-English speaking population.  In the past it was necessary for a person to be bilingual or use an interpreter.  Now, a handheld voice-to-voice phrase translation system (PTS) makes such verbal communication possible.  MAI's SBIR Phase Idemonstrated the technical feasibility and marketability of a handheld PTS.  MAI's SBIR Phase II objective is to develop and produce a commercially viable handheld PTS.  The concept of operations and preliminary design from the SBIR Phase I effort will beused as the basis of the Phase II effort to design, build and demonstrate an engineering prototype system.  A detailed production specification for the final design for the commercial handheld PTS will also be completed.  MAI is committed to the rapidcommercialization of both the PTS and the handheld PTS.

It utilizes the return signal phase, which is usually discarded.On this basis the Navy will have a reliable all-weather identification system thatdoes not require the cooperation of the target.",

This project will develop a continuous reactor to economically produce high-yield SWNT using coal-based materials.   The proposed reactor will utilize a flow-through design and allow control of production parameters, including catalyst composition and particle size, catalyst/coal ratio, temperature of reaction and annealing zones, and reaction time.  The use of low cost coal-based materials as source of carbon, catalyst, and promoter will assure the low cost of the product.  Phase I demonstrated that SWNT in good yield can be produced from coal based material.  A plasma system, based on inductive coupling plasma, was developed and tested.  Although the SWNT products were produced at moderate yield, the approach was shown to have potential for large-scale production and to be synergetic with the coal powder form.  In Phase II, a flexible reactor design will be developed to introduce coal-based materials in powder form.  A mathematical model that takes reaction parameters into account will be used to simulate the SWNT production process.  The approaches will be scaled-up to produce commercial quantities of this novel and versatile material.                    Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: High-yield, low cost SWNT should find a significant market in such applications as field emission devices, memory devices (high density memory arrays, memory logic switching arrays), Nano-MEMs, AFM imaging probes, distributed diagnostics sensors, and strain sensors.  Other key applications include: thermal control materials, super-strength (100 times steel) and light weight reinforcement and nanocomposites, EMI shielding materials, catalytic support, gas storage materials, high surface area electrodes, and light weight conductor cable and wires.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         60318       The substitution of AlN for beryllia (in microelectronics, high-power microwave tubes, heat sinks, etc.), to eliminate the adverse environmental and health impacts of beryllia, is presently hampered by a lack of suitable techniques for metallizing the AlN.  Non-oxide ceramics such as AlN present a significant challenge for traditional metallization approaches used for conventional oxides.  State-of-the-art commercial metallizing techniques for non-oxide ceramics have poor adhesion, are often cracked at the interface, and are rough and unreliable.  This project will examine metal ion implantation into the AlN substrate with a transition to a controlled microstructure metal coating as a low cost reliable process to apply highly adherent metal coatings to AlN when substituting for beryllia.  Phase I demonstrated that pulsed ion beam processing can be used to implant metals into the AlN surface with a transition to a controlled microstructure.  The ion beam implanted metallized coatings on AlN had adhesive strengths greater than 80 MPa, the limit of the tester, whereas commercial metallized AlN strengths were under 50 MPa.  A thermal resistance test showed that the metallized AlN was at least 20% better than commercial metallized beryllia despite beryllias higher thermal conductivity.  Phase II will address low cost optimization and process development, leading to the commercial demonstration of several applications of beryllia substitution.                 Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as describe by the awardee: The first application is as a substitute for all beryllia.  Other applications include diode mounts, heat sinks, microelectric packaging tubes, and circuit boards.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         60754      Oxide-dispersion strengthened (ODS) iron aluminide alloys have been shown to exhibit high creep strength and excellent corrosion resistance.  However, it is difficult to join the alloys because the dispersed oxides agglomerate, thus compromising the mechanical properties of the base material.  Diffusion bonding, in which two clean surfaces are joined by diffusion under high temperature and pressure, would be a candidate solution, but residual surface oxide contamination can cause lower fracture toughness and ductility of the joint.   This project will utilize a pulsed electric field during diffusion bonding to join ODS intermetallic materials at lower pressures and shorter times.  In this processing technique, no alloying elements are used in the joined interface, leading to joint strengths near those of the base material at high temperature.   In Phase I, MA956 rods that were diffusion-bonded for only 30 minutes at low pressure, using pulsed-electric field conditions, showed substantially higher strength than specimens fabricated without the pulsed electric field.  Ultrasonic and x-ray analysis suggested that the pulsed electric field enhanced metal diffusion across the interface.   In Phase II, the pulse-bonding technology will be statistically tested using a wider range of experimental conditions, including pressure, variation of temperature, and pulsing conditions.  High-temperature tensile testing will be conducted on MA956 and Fe3Al rods and tubes.  Sequential creep testing and environmental characterization under oxidizing and sulfidizing atmospheres will also be performed.                    Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The major application of this technology will be in the manufacture of iron aluminide components for high-temperature turbines and coal gasification furnaces.

Graphite fiber, because of its lightweight, reinforced composites have been a material of frequent choice to produce space based optical components. A novel and unique new approach to reduce the weight of graphite fiber up to 50% has been cursory shown to be feasible. This program proposes to develop carbon/graphite fibers with substantial weight reduction for use as reinforcements to fabricate ultra-lightweight space based optical systems. Carbon/graphite fibers with up to 50% reduced mass will be demonstrated and sufficient quantities produced to fabricate composites to characterize for demonstrating the mass reduction that can be expected in space based optical systems. Such an ultra-lightweight material is expected to generate a paradigm shift for any application that must overcome gravity and its own momentum.",

This SBIR Phase II program is focused on the optimization of highly efficient andcompact minireformers for this application.  The steam reforming process, which allows higher yield of hydrogen in comparison to partial oxidation reaction, is harnessed for conversion of diesel, JP-8 and other hydrocarbon fuels into CO free hydrogen.  ThePhase I demonstrated the feasibility of development of a compact, low cost multichannel minireformer from superalloy that can withstand high temperature of reaction for a long time using MER's proprietary technique.  The incorporation of multichannels intomembrane reformer has the advantage of very high surface area membrane for high hydrogen flux, enhancing the equilibrium shift and increase the production capacity by 75% eliminating significantly reducing coke formation.  The Phase II program will befocused on optimization of fabrication technology for multichannel superalloy minireactors, further membrane development, optimization for catalyst for steam reforming, establishing optimum conditions for steam reforming in multichannel membraneminireformers, and determination of optimal design and fabrication of the optimized reformer.  Successful accomplishment of these objectives will culminate by designing and constructing a prototype fully integrated reformer for delivery to the Air Forcefor demonstration of the technology.",

The approach is based on a novel MERs technique for the fabrication of multichannel mini-reactors incorporating hydrogen separating membrane.  Multichannel mini-reactor shrinks the dimensions through which energy and reactants travel to their desired location, an consequently, heat an mass transfer are dramatically improved.  Membranes provide selective removal of hydrogen concurrently with the reaction, which makes possible higher than equilibrium fuel conversion.  In the Phase II program multichannel reformer utilizing nanotechnology ceramic membrane will be developed.  The fabrication technology for multichannel reactors as well as the technology for membrane deposition on microchannel walls will be optimized.  All components of the experimental bench-scale and 5kW on-board partial oxidation multichannel membrane reformers will be designed and fabricated.  Both bench-scale and on-board reformers will be tested; optimum operating conditions will be established and the cost effectiveness will be determined.  It is expected that the produced results will demonstrate high efficiency and low cost of the proposed reformer.  The development of multichannel membrane reformer will open up new opportunities for commercialization of on-board reforming technology for fuel cell-powered vehicles.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         60716     Intermediate temperature (<800C), planar solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) require the development of low-cost, oxidation-resistant, metallic interconnects.   Commercially available alloys are limited for this application because they contain chromium, which oxidizes in both air and fuel, forming an electrically resistive layer that slowly evaporates, lowering SOFC efficiency.  This project will develop suitable coatings that suppress oxidation kinetics, suppress the volatilization of chromium oxide, and lower the overall resistance, thus increasing efficiency.   In Phase I, thin (~2000 Angstroms) coatings of certain metals and oxides were deposited on commercial nickel-based alloy and stainless steel foils.  The foils were oxidized in air and fuel, and their resistance was measured both ex-situ (out of stack) and in-situ (in four cell stacks).  The coatings suppressed the oxidation kinetics, and also lowered the net resistance.  Stack power at 800C was more than doubled by using coated interconnects.  Even more importantly, the interconnect resistance decreased with time, and correspondingly, stack power increased with time.  In Phase II, the main focus will be on identifying coatings that will be able to suppress the oxidation kinetics of low cost materials, such as stainless steels, for several thousand hours while maintaining low resistance and achieving a stack power density of ~1W/?2 using natural gas as fuel.  Low-cost, large volume methods for the deposition of coatings will be developed.  Several four-cell stacks, and one 1 kW stack will be tested for long periods of time using coated interconnects exhibiting ultra-low resistance.                   Commercial Applications And Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The metallic interconnects should allow for numerous applications of highly efficient solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) in distributed, residential, automotive, and portable power.  The devices would operate on hydrocarbon fuels at high efficiency while creating negligible pollution.",

Phase I developments resulted in the development of Gr-foams bonded to aluminum, copper and Al:SiCthermal base planes with heat transfer coefficients of over 15,000 W/m2K.  This major advance in heat transfer capacity promises to revolutionize heat exchanger designs.  The proposed Phase II research aims complete the developments on Phase I and toadvance the fabrication technology sufficiently to prove its capability to produce cost effective thermal management devices in emerging, fast growing market applications.  Proposed Phase II research emphasizes demonstrators with applications in 1)directly cooled silicon devices, II) IC packaging cooling devices, iii) IGBT cooling modules, and iv) cross flow fluid cooling radiators for engine cooling.  MRi proposes to team with technology sources, suppliers and end users to advance the design,fabrication and test of such demonstration devices.  MRi is proposing to join with Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), POCO Graphite, Thermacore and Performance Research to complete the critical developments and analyses of the proposed Gr-foam corethermal management devices.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin malignancy in the United States.  With the exception of lung cancer, it is the leading cause of death in men in the country.  By age 80, the risk of developing prostate cancer is estimated to be 1 in 7.  Despiteincreased public awareness, regular check-ups, and improved therapeutic interventions greater than 31,000 American men will die from prostate cancer during calendar year 2000. The current proposal seeks to develop a new form of immunotherapy usingdendritic cell (DC) based DNA vaccines to combat this serious disease.  During Phase I, DC were isolated and transfected with 3 genes believed important in cytotoxic T cell (TC) killing of prostate cancer cells.  The transfected DC remained functional andfurther enhanced TC proliferation rates by 40-50% versus controls.  In addition, initial results showed that TC which had been cultured with the transfected DC caused 16-40% cytotoxicity in target prostate tumor cells.  Phase II research will continue tolay the groundwork for an improved DNA vaccine against prostate cancer. Prostate tumors will be established in SCID mice and animal experiments will be performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the proposed immunotherapeutic approach.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Chemical warfare agents such as bis-(b-chloroethyl) sulfide (HD) pose a significant threat to U.S. military and civilian populations. Exposure of skin to HD causes burn-like symptoms such as erythema, edema and severe incapacitating vesication(blistering).  To combat this threat, prophylactic and/or therapeutic interventions to HD exposure are needed. Development of such interventions requires an understanding of the mechanism of action of HD. However, a major impediment to understanding ofHD-induced pathogenesis is lack of an adequate experimental model system of human skin.  Since current models do not possess the appropriate attributes for HD research such as a complete basement membrane with dermal/epidermal adhesion structures, an invitro human skin model for HD-related studies is needed.  The purpose of the current proposal is to develop an in vitro human skin model suitable for HD research.  The model will contain human keratinocytes and/or fibroblasts and will possess allmorphological and ultrastructural features required for HD research. The model's response to HD or HD analogues will be investigated in terms of biochemical effects leading to blister formation.  The model will also be utilized to gain a mechanisticunderstanding of HD-induced vesication and to investigate prophylactic and/or therapeutic interventions to HD exposure.  In addition to providing a model which will greatly facilitate sulfur mustard vesication studies, this work will lead to a fullthickness skin model which will allow the study of numerous dermis-based skin phenomena such as photoaging, photodamage, wound healing and cancer progression.  This improved tissue model will be useful to the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industry inirritancy and efficacy testing of their new products.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION(provided by applicant): During Phase I, human Langerhans cell (LC)       lines were obtained by transfecting or infecting LC progenitor cells derived         from peripheral blood and bone marrow. The best cell lines were transformed          with a well-known viral oncogene and could be expanded by 1000 fold in culture.      A supplemental experiment showed that the cells could be cloned; in this             non-optimized experiment, the most successful clone maintained on LC phenotype,      exhibited log phase growth with a doubling time of 2.75 days, and had expanded       40,000 fold as of the date of submission of this proposal. Cryopreservation did      not affect the ability of the cells to proliferate and the phenotype of the          cells could be modulated with cytokines. The morphology of the cells remained        dendritice and ultrastructural analysis confirmed that the cells contained           Birbeck granules, the key ultrastructural feature of Langerhans cells (LC).          Phenotypic characterization of cells showed that the cells could be matured          into LC, as evidenced by high levels of CD1 a expression. In addition, in a          functional assay, the cell lines retained their ability to stimulate T-cells in      a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). Phase II research will expand on the Phase I      results. Initial studies will focus on the ability to further enhance the            proliferate capacity and lifespan of the cells. The cells lines produced will        be cloned and the phenotype, chemokine receptors, ultrastructure , gene              expression and karotype of the resultant clones will be characterized.               Chemotactic and phagocytic properties of the cells will be evaluated and the         utility of the cell lines will be demonstrated in HIV infection and cancer           immuno-therapy studies. Finally, the ability to incorporate the cells into a         highly differentiated skin model and the capacity of such an immuno-competent        model to predict allergic contact dermatitis will be studied.                        PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The proposed research will produce human Langerhans cell lines useful in a broad spectrum   of biomedical research.  The LC lines will provide researchers the means to study the   biology and function of LC in their native, unprimed state.  Researchers will gain a valuable  immunological tool to study and develop therapies against cancer and viral infections including  HIV.  Finally, a skin model containing immunologically competent cells would be extremely  valuable to a large number of companies in evaluating whether their products are likely to  cause allergic contact dermatitis.",

Mayflower is proposing to develop a small, low-cost tactical GPSarray and antenna electronics unit to suppress up to three (3) wideband jammers in excess of 30 dB with a convergence time of less than 1 ms.  The unique feature of the Mayflower small CRPA is that the signal distortions associated with the reduction ofthe antenna spacing and miniaturization of the antenna elements are compensated automatically by the antenna algorithm, instead of expensive calibrations and modifications of the array housing in order to reduce the mutual coupling.  In addition, theantenna algorithm will be implemented in an existing Mayflower antenna electronics unit through mostly software changes.  Miniaturization of the antenna electronics in a future program by developing a downconverter MMIC and a digital beamformer ASIC, willresult in a unique, miniature, low-cost, GPS anti-jam system for small missile applications.",

These procedures usually require two             vascular access sites; one for draining blood and the other returning treated        blood. The blood treatment applications can also be performed using a single         cannula in a tidal flow arrangement that alternately drains and infuses a            volume of blood. The use of a single cannula system has considerable cost and        safety advantages over the current two-cannula system. The Baxter MetaPlus Pump      possesses safety features that make it the only commercially available pump          suitable for use in a single cannula, tidal flow configuration. A tidal flow         extracorporeal blood pump (T-Pump) will be developed in the form of an               auxiliary electronic controller and clamp assembly designed to be used in            conjunction with the MetaPlus pump. A novel clamp configuration and flow             control algorithm will be employed to increase safety and efficacy, and allow        the system to adapt to changes in patient blood flow/pressure conditions. Phase      II research will include refinement of control software, design of a control         console, modification of clamp design, extensive evaluation in vivo, and             packaging of the system.

McQ will expand its multispectral sensor target feature extraction development work which addresses signal frequency content, amplitude variations, slope of signaturetransitions, monotonic and harmonic content, statistical properties, location, and direction.  A second technology area will be intelligent fusion processing of these extensive target features to separate targets of interest in a multitarget environment.The third technology area is to develop new multiwavelength imaging technology to automatically detect targets and track them.  Team members Remote Reality and Lehigh University will lead this effort.  They will advance Automated Target Recognition beyondthe visual spectrum to the near IR and far IR adding temperature information to the shape and motion characteristics.  The fourth technology area will be the intelligent fusion processing using object oriented data architecture which integratesmultispectral sensor and image feature characteristics to build a major breakthrough in automated target recognition and tracking.  The fifth technology area will be in target path prediction.  This technology will be a derivative of the specific targetidentification and tracking.  McQ will develop and deliver an advanced sensor that automatically detects, classifies, locates, and tracks targets.  This sensor will send object oriented target messages that characterize the target and contain theautomatically extracted pixels of only the target to aid in target identification.",

A colposcopy workstation will be built with enhanced software       and wavelength filtered light capability to collect necessary patient data.                                                                                               A cohort of 25 patients with high grade Cervical Intraepitheliel Neoplasia (C/N      II/III will be imaged with the modified I workstation to quantify how these          image enhancements improve the predictive value of colposcopy. The                   time-dependent and spectral data will be used to improve the accuracy of             colposcopy in the discrimination of high grade lesions from other conditions         including low grade lesions (C/NI) and normal tissue.                                                                                                                     A time-sequenced series of images will be collected after the uniform and timed      application of 5 percent acetic acid onto the cervix. Images will be processed       to find predictive markers such as (1) lifetime and intensity of acetowhitening and  resulting temporal decay curves, and (2) spectral changes in reflectance due to  acetowhitening.  Techniques will be improved for the processing and analysis of  temporal curves to enhance their predictive value.  PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  Completion of this Phase I program will lay the groundwork for significantly improved digital  colposcopic instrumentation.  The timed spectral images of cervical acetowhitening will  improve the quality of clinical treatment while reducing costs.  As with any new technology,  market commercialization will depend on the willingness of physicians to accept the new             technology.  The device developed in this application, however, is similar to existing   colposcopes, and the barrier to acceptance should be less as users in the OB/Gyn   community are familiar with this equipment.  The device will allow for improved accuracy  in the mapping and grading of cervical cancer.",

Although commercialization issues are important, most of these issues will be deferred to the Commercialization Phase post Phase 2. Only relevant aspects will be included into Phase 2 planning andimplementation and these will be noted when applicable.  The content and technology Medsn would produce for Phase II would be commercialized in the Pharmaceutical/Medical Device Industry and other markets. It will open a new market for an additionalrevenue stream. Medsn is currently focused on offering products and services to the Pharmaceutical and Medical Device industry. Some of the company's current customer list includes AstraZeneca, Roche, Johnson & Johnson (various divisions), Eli Lilly,Medtronic and Guidant. There is an established need in these industries for training their Sales Representatives in Anatomy and Physiology related topics. Furthermore, the technology developed for Phase II would be adopted to enhance the instructionaldesign and delivery of instruction to our current customers. We will able to re-use and re-deploy the content that we are building for Phase II for current and future clients. The pharmaceutical and medical device companies which have over 85,000 salespeople in the U.S. can utilize various modules from Anatomy and Physiology curriculum that we will build in Phase II. Pharmaceutical and Medical Device companies will able to utilize the modules being created as foundation level educational programs.Another potential new market would be the EMT Training market. The curriculum being developed for Phase II can be readily applied to educating Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT), spanning the civilian and military markets. on key characteristics of thecivilian EMT market. We have to have a final product that we will able to test market with potential customers. During Phase 2 we will continue to develop the commercialization plan and conducting test marketing to validate the need for the learningmodules that will develop during Phase 2. Fully commercialization roll-out will occur after a full set of modules as outlined in this document are built and tested on our e-learning platform.",

This project will develop a new design concept for the effective conversion of ocean currents into electric power using the helical turbine.   Phase I established the feasibility of an integrated design of an extremely efficient power plant employing a number of modules containing helical turbines, which generate inexpensive and reliable electrical power from free-flowing ocean currents.

While, untapped sources exist, including off-gas and fuel gas streams generated on-site, hydrogen recovery has been problematic.  Membranes have been used for this application but membrane failure caused by plasticization and condensation of heavy hydrocarbons has led to a shutdown of a number of plants.  In this project a new class of membrane material that is completely inert to hydrocarbons will be developed.  These membranes do not fail after exposure to hydrogen vapors or condensed liquids.  In Phase I, membrane performance was evaluated in bench-scale membrane stamp and membrane module tests.  Experiments showed that the membranes were able to withstand exposure to high hydrocarbon partial pressures up to saturation without being damaged, and that they retained their useful properties.  A technical and economic analysis was performed.   In Phase II, the membranes will be optimized and produced on industrial-scale membrane casting and coating equipment.  The best membranes will be incorporated into modules.  The process will be scaled up and evaluated in the laboratory and in field tests at cooperating refineries.                       Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: Hydrogen-permeable membranes have not been widely used in refinery applications because of poor reliability.

The technology can measure changes in prepreg properties as well such as resin contentvariations and aging of resin.  The prepregs are used in manufacturing aerospace composite structures.  Exposed to high stress and fatigue these structures can fail catastrophically if there is any contaminant that constitutes non-resin, non-fibermaterials leading to loss of lives and aircrafts.The aerospace industry is pursuing automation in all aspects of manufacturing.  For example, prepreg manufacturers are using intelligent machines with feedback control to manufacture composite prepregs.  Aerospace structures demand the best in automation.Fiber placement process is key to manufacturing good parts automatically using advanced computer automated design tools, intelligent machinery and robotics.Designing nondestructive testing into advanced manufacturing processes is the best method to prevent part failures.  Integrating the magnetic resonance system into prepreg manufacturing and fiber placement process ensures defect free parts as well assignificant reduction in cost in post-factum quality assurance procedures.  The magnetic resonance system will provide real-time information on presence of contaminants, resin content and aging using automated processes thus leading to the next level inQuality.",

This       problem has become even more serious in the era of managed care, and the             information explosion from the news media, pharmacies and pharmaceutical             company advertising. The proposed videotape series will teach physicians and         other caregivers to make better decisions about treating older adults with           antipsychotic drugs. Our Phase I educational videotape successfully targeted         one dimension of this problem: it significantly improved the capacity of             physicians to recognize and manage serious neurological side effects. Phase II       will expand by creating a series of four additional videotapes. This expansion       will be \"horizontal\" - aimed at teaching physicians 1) the proper selection of       geriatric patients for antipsychotic drugs and 2) the recognition and                management of side effects AND \"vertical\"- aimed at teaching other care givers       and patients about the uses and side effects of the drugs. We have assembled an      outstanding team of experts in geriatric medicine, psychiatry, nursing,              psychopharmacology, education and media to accomplish these objectives. We           shall market to Pharmaceutical and Managed Care Companies, Geriatric                 Institutions, physicians and other health care providers.

Earlier studies have shown that microwave radiometric sensing is a promising         technique which when combined with mammography, would be useful in reducing          noncancerous breast biopsies based on mammographic false positives, thereby          improving the positive predictive value (PPV) of mammography. These earlier          studies will be expanded to include additional clinical sites, investigative         ways in which system performance can be improved, and to provide more detailed       pathological information that will assist in discovering the reasons for             thermal activity.                                                                                                                                                         By gaining a better understanding of the reason for thermal anomalies, we can        discover the true capabilities of radiometric or thermal-based sensing.                                                                                                   Considering the high cost of unnecessary breast biopsies, both financially and       emotionally, a system utilizing thermal information should prove to be of great      benefit.

The instruments used are passive standoff chemical agent detector already fielded (LSCAD).  Each instrument individually can only measurethe total of all the chemical in its line-of-site; the distance to the cloud is unknown.  By merging data from multiple vantage points (either one instrument moving past the cloud or two or more instruments spaced so as to view the cloud from differencedirections) a map of the cloud location can be generated.  To improve the sensitivity and accuracy of the cloud map, chemical point sensors can be added to the sensor array being used.  The equipment requried for the proposed system is eithergovernment-off-the-shelf or commercially available.  Also, the data fusion techniques (tomography) have been demonstrated previously in the medical field.

Rapid heat and mass transfer in the small channels allows forsignificantly smaller reactor and heat-exchanger volumes, lighter system weight, and faster startup.  When coupled with high-performance materials for thermal insulation and trace-ammonia adsorption, our mesochannel reactor system will achieve abreakthrough hydrogen storage density of greater than 1 kW-hr/kg based on a fuel-cell efficiency of 50%.During Phase II, we will develop our mesochannel-based reactor system into a safe, rugged hydrogen supply for hydrogen/air fuel cells.  Our steady-operation, 50-watt Phase I system will be improved to reduce size and weight and to improve itsmanufacturability.

Evidence           suggests that up to one-third of those deaths are related to malnutrition and        cachexia for which there are currently no effective nutritional interventions.       Weight loss is a predictor of survival in patients receiving cancer therapy and      supplemental nutrition is often indicated in patients undergoing surgery,            chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. Phase I research has clearly shown that          daily supplementation with HMB/Arg/Gln was effective in preventing and               reversing the weight and muscle mass losses in stage IV cancer patients who          were undergoing various regimens of chemotherapy. In this Phase II multicenter       trial, it is proposed to include a more homogenous group of cancer patients,         with diagnoses limited to lung and proximal GI-tract cancers which are               notoriously known to result in significant wasting. The proposal will determine      if early therapeutic interventions with HMB/Arg/Gln will result in (a)               decreasing weight loss, (b) reversing muscle wasting, (c) decreasing protein         turnover, (d) decreasing toxicity to chemotherapeutic agents and better              adherence to chemotherapeutic regimens, and (e) improving overall feeling of         well being. If as expected Phase II results confirm the effectiveness of the         nutrient mixture in cancer patients, a product would be marketed for this            purpose.                                                                             PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  Since over 1.2 million cases of cancer are expected to be diagnosed this year alone  (American Cancer Society), the market potential for the proposed nutritional product is very  large.  It is expected that Phase II will continue to support the positive findings of Phase I  and that a product containing the nutrient combination in a ready-to-drink formulation would  be marketed upon this confirmation.  A balanced nutritional product containing high quality   protein and other nutrients would likely be developed.  It is envisioned that these products  will be highly effective over-the-counter and/or prescription nutritional supplements for   cancer patients with cachexia to improve quality of life of cancer patients.",

This project will develop commercially viable refractive (and reflective) beam steerers based on the recently developed lubricated adjustable optical wedge.  The refractive adjustable optical wedge is mounted on axis and the singlepivot point of the transmitted beam stays on the original axis, so there is no astigmatism from multiple pivot points (as there is with dual mirror and Risely Wedge beam steerers).  It offers high transmission and more user friendly operation (Cartesianversus polar adjustments) than Risley Wedge beam steerers.  In Phase I we demonstrated that with new and improved transparent lubricants it can handle high power lasers beams.  The",

This 24month Phase II base program extends the development of the FLV concept through an experimental evaluation stage to demonstrate the concept feasibility. The principal technical objectives are (a) to develop atransportable FLV prototype system suitable for ground-based demonstrations at a field site and (b) to carry out experimental FLV performance evaluations in a calibrated fluid-flow facility that reproduces the specified velocity range and spatialgradients. The resulting prototype system will establish the configurations for the laser, transmitter/receiver optics, data acquisition electronics, and data processing software. An additional 6month Phase II-Option program is also proposed thatsupports comprehensive field measurements of large-scale currents in deep water from a ground-based platform. The final results of both programs will provide an experimentally validated evaluation of the performance capabilities of an FLV system fordeep-water, ocean applications from an airborne or shipboard platform and allow a determination of its suitability for future Phase III work.",

Computer simulations,analytical calculations and laboratory experiments were performed to arrive at a systemarchitecture that would satisfy the high-speed measurement requirements associatedwith landmine detection. The most promising of these methods is the basis for theinstrument to be developed and fielded during Phase II. This innovative LDV instrumentwill enable the measurement of small ground velocities at rates that are two orders ofmagnitude faster than is presently possible. The instrument would initially measure aone-meter span from a standoff distance of two to six meters but it would be expandableto larger spans in the future.  At the end of the Phase II program, we anticipate demonstratinghigh-speed land mine detection in a field test at a location selected by the Army.",

The Phase 2 work will  consist of developing a system prototype including all the hardware and  software for real-time measurement of sprays, system testing with  known-size particles, and system testing with realistic sprays. Phase 1  measurements with calibrated glass beads and calibrated liquid sprays  showed a remarkable accuracy that placed the measurement within the  particle manufacturer's tolerances.

This theory was demonstrated on three, related one-on-one, submarine engagement problems.  The tactics developed in Phase Iare one-sided.  The target does not react to the presence or tactics of the friendly ship.  The goal of the Phase II work is to extend the Phase I work to account for and anticipate smart behavior by the target.  We propose to do this by extending thetactical decision making theory developed in Phase I to a two-sided game in which both platforms can be formulated as a two-sided, non-zero sum game.  These games have no minimax solution.  Instead, Nash showed that every finite multi-person, general sumgame has at least one equilibrium outcome in mixed strategies.  A set of pure or mixed strategies, one for each player, is said to be in equilibrium if no one player can change his strategy unilaterally and gain a higher payoff.  We propose to usenon-linear methods, such as path following and one-sided iteration, to find solutions that satisfy (approximately) the Nash equilibrium.",

Even with the establishment of Noise Abatement procedures, there is a significant need for improvement in the mitigation of noise created by aircraft operations. Some Noise Abatement procedures are difficult to implement for the controller, pilot, or both. In such cases, automated assistance for the controller may improve the effectiveness of the Noise Abatement procedure, by allowing aircraft to be vectored to follow the procedure more accurately.Metron has advanced the state of the art in aircraft noise modeling to the point that it is now possible to conduct noise modeling in real-time with sufficient accuracy to support controller decisions. This proposed effort will investigate the feasibility of a system which will predict noise footprints for individual flights based on current atmospheric conditions. These flight-by-flight analyses will then be used to generate alternative routes if the noise footprint is found to impact areas of significant population density. The generation of departure routes to decrease the impact of noise will then result in departure vector advisories to be displayed to the controller.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Topical Skin Protectants (TSPs) comprised of perfluorinated polyether oil thickened with PTFE are currently used to protect of military personnel from Chemical Warfare Agents (CWAs).  The existing TSPs provide an effective physical barrier to CWAs butpossess no destructive capacity toward the CWAs, thus limiting their long-term effectiveness and posing an unnecessary hazard to personnel. The incorporation of catalytically reactive materials capable of neutralizing chemical warfare agents, nerve agentsand/or vesicants, would markedly enhance the efficacy of TSPs and reduce risk to personnel.  Under the Phase I SBIR program METSS was able to identify and synthesize several catalytically reactive chemical enzymes capable of neutralizing common CWAsimulants in an extremely time effective manner.  Furthermore, METSS was able to incorporate these chemistries into a representative TSP cream formulation and verify enhanced barrier performance through the destruction of test simulants.  The results ofthe Phase I program efforts clearly demonstrate the technical feasibility of developing reactive TSPs using chemistries that are commerciality available and readily incorporated into existing TSP formulations.  The resultant creams are stable and highlyreactive.  METSS will further develop these concepts under an applied Phase II program that will clearly establish a very strong foundation for product commercialization efforts.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Under a Phase I SBIR program, METSS has demonstrated the technical feasibility of developing environmentally benign helicopter deicing/anti-icing fluids based on carbohydrates, lactates, and their derivatives. The selection of these materials was governedby models developed by METSS to identify potential replacement materials for the current glycol-based systems used for fixed-wing aircraft.  The formulations developed by METSS were subjected to tests derived from SAE AMS 1424 for aircraft.  BOD and CODtests were performed to assess environmental impact. Additional tests, developed by METSS, were carried out to evaluate specific materials compatibility issues originating from the application of these fluids onto helicopter components.  The results of thePhase I program clearly indicate the technical feasibility of developing effective deicing/anti-icing fluids based on carbohydrate and lactate systems that address environmental impact issues without compromising performance.  Near term commercializationof the proposed systems will be supported by commercial development efforts already initiated by METSS for other deicing/anti-icing technologies targeted for aircraft, runway and other transportation and facility applications.  Under the Phase II program,METSS will optimize the development of the proposed technologies and fully qualify the candidate fluids against appropriate performance specifications, thus forming a solid foundation for product commercialization and near term product availability.  Inaddition, METSS will work with the Army to develop performance specifications and specific technical orders that will address helicopter specific issues and describe the methods by which these materials shall be applied in the field.",

Our system is based on laser         micro-beam CT scanning of tissue-equivalent dosimeter gels that change their         optical properties in proportion to the absorbed dose. In Phase I we have            designed, built and thoroughly tested two different prototypes of the                micro-scanner, and have successfully proved the feasibility of our idea. In          Phase II we will complete the research and development of the micro-scanner and      will engineer various gel phantoms for micro-scanning. We will field-test our        system in a clinical environment, and perform thorough dosimetry studies of          various small fields and brachytherapy sources of clinical importance,               comparing our technique with radiochromic film measurements. In Phase III we         will license out the manufacture of our micro-scanner, and concentrate our           efforts on manufacturing various gel dosimetry phantoms for high-resolution 3D       dosimetry. We believe that our system will find widespread use in QA procedures      and in patient treatment verification, wherever very high dose gradients are         present in the treatment plan.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Michigan Aerospace has developed a new autonomous satellite docking and servicing system for the Orbital Express program.  The new design is based on analysis and technology assessments performed in the Phase I SBIR.  As a result of this analysis andassessment, it was determined that the Michigan Aerospace docking and servicing mechanism design provides the most viable solution for both a near-term demonstration and operational autonomous satellite docking system.  We also believe that further groundtesting of sensors and auto-GNC algorithms, as well as the docking and servicing mechanism, are required.  A near-term test of these subsystems, individually and together as a system, will provide valuable hard data to support the Orbital Express designphase.  Several organizations have prototypes of systems in these two areas, but require testing to validate their performance.  In Phase II, Michigan Aerospace is proposing to build the next generation docking and servicing mechanism and test thismechanism along with the other systems described above, at Marshall Space Flight Center.  It is believed that the technology development and testing plan proposed by Michigan Aerospace will help meet the requirements of the Orbital Express demonstrationand promote the maturation of technology needed for the operational system.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The importance of reproduction in livestock production is tremendous. However, little progress has been made with regard to decreasing embryonic mortality. The instruments used for in vitro embryo production (IVP) have not changed dramatically over several decades. This research is aimed at development, testing and optimization of microfluidic devices and associated procedures for in vitromaturation (IVM), in vitro fertilization (IVF) and embryo culture (EC) of bovine embryos. The three specific aims of this proposal are: 1) to develop Polydimeythlsiloxane (PDMS-based) devices for dynamic IVP studies, 2) to study the effect of dynamic flow conditions on IVM, IVF and EC separately and in combination, and 3) to explore the use of microfluidic, tectonic-based microsystems for IVP. Currently, static culture is the standard practice for IVP of mammalian embryos. The dynamic systems that are being used currently use flow rates several orders of magnitude higher than the proposed system. The proposed system will allow precise control of fresh medium past the oocytes/embryos, and allow the composition of the medium to be gradually changed over a period of time. These microfluidic systems will provide embryos with dramatically improved microenvironments that more closely mimic in vitro conditions and lead to improved embryonic development.",

Some situations, however, require the ability to model dynamic work environments and scenarios. We are beginning to understand how models developed by the different engineering disciplines can talk to each other, allowingfor each system element to dynamically interact; what is needed is an engineering environment that will support this.  The main technical objectives toward this end has been to develop and document an open environment framework for exchange of data betweenhuman performance modeling software, animated human figure software, and physical environment simulations, which includes situation knowledge databases. Progress was made towards that objective in the phase I effort.  The phase I effort includedinvestigating different data exchange protocols, modeling tools, developing a language database and experimenting with the language using a simple Visual Basic demonstration application. The phase II effort would focus on implementation of an ApplicationProgrammer Interface (API) specification to support interaction between human figure models and human process performance models.",

This research was motivatedby the need for improved behavioral realisms in computergenerated forces (CGFs) with an eye toward reducing and, perhaps,even eliminating the need for human-in-the-loop simulations.Rather than continue in the tradition of rational choice theoriesand rule-based expert systems, we took a novel approach to thisresearch and began work on a model of Recognition Primed Decisionmaking (RPD). During the basic Phase II work, we propose to:extend the model of decision making under uncertainty wedeveloped during our Phase I work by investigating andincorporating a more complete model of stress;  and evaluate theuser interfaces prototyped during Phase I; construct themiddleware necessary to embed our decision models in HLA-compliant simulations; identify three decisions within a CGFenvironment to be effected by our model and construct models forthese decision.

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Verbatim from Applicant's Abstract):Rapid identification of             bacteria direct from a blood culture bottle would speed up patient treatment         and recovery, thereby also greatly reducing hospital care costs. The current         procedure of subculturing typically takes from 24 to 48 hours to obtain              bacterial identifications. Gas chromatographic analysis of bacterial fatty           acids has promise as a rapid and inexpensive identification technique if the         system were more sensitive and if the impact of the blood fatty acids could be       minimized. Splitless injection, purification of the air supply, decreased data       rate collection and concentration of the sample provide an increase in               sensitivity of more than 1,600,000X. Lysis of blood cells by saponin or              detergents coupled with filtration greatly reduces contamination of the              bacterial fatty acids by blood components. New algorithms show promise for           reducing the impact of blood components and for naming the components of             polymicrobic cultures. A novel technique for rapid derivatization of fatty           acids shows promise of very rapid identification of the pathogens. As patient        care costs exceed $1,000 per day, the new technique could produce great health       care cost savings. Additionally, by allowing targeted treatment and decreased        recovery times, the technique should reduce patient suffering and aid in             reducing the number of nosocomial infections.

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Phase II project is proposed to further develop and commercialize MicroCoating Technologies' NanoMiser technology for the production of high quality nanopowders.  Phase I has demonstrated a novel, low-cost method able to produce a variety ofnanopowders of tailored size and composition.  The results from Phase I have established a solid ground for this Phase II plan, which will focus on producing yttria stabilized zirconia nanopowders that have dual applications in both the military andcivilian sectors.  We will work on: (1) optimizing our process to control nanopower properties, (2) developing an efficient collection and dispersion system, and (3) scaling the process to commercial production levels.MircoCoating Technologies has developed its proprietary device-the Naomiser.  This innovative atomizer is capable of producing uniform, submicron aerosol, and order of magnitude smaller than those achieved by currently available state-of-the-art atomizersusing ultrasonics and electrostatic processes.  Processing of these aerosols directly leads to the formation of desired nanopowders.  This process provides three major advantages: (1) low cost, (2) high quality nanopowders, and (3) continuous operation.Successes in this Phase II research will lead to a commercially viable technology in the production of nanopowders.  The technology is expected to benefit both the military and civilian sectors by providing a low cost, commercially viable process for thesynthesis of high quality nanopowders that can be used to improve materials, minimize devices and provide special properties.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         60370          Internal tin Nb3Sn superconducting strands and Rutherford cables are the focus of superconducting magnet fabrications for high field physics applications.  During magnet processing and operation, the strands and cables are subjected to large stresses and it is essential that these cables and their insulation perform under these conditions.  In addition, the insulation for the superconducting wires and cables should be capable of withstanding temperatures over 600-800C, the reaction temperature of Nb and Sn filaments when forming superconductor.  This project seeks to produce high dielectric strength, high modulus, and ultra-thin ceramic insulator for internal tin Nb3Sn superconducting strands and Rutherford cables.  The insulation would not only substantially improve magnet performance, eliminating complex coil fabrication steps and lowering production cost, but also enable new designs that would allow superconducting magnets to achieve maximum field strength and system lifetime.  In Phase I, a patented Combustion Chemical Vapor Deposition (CCVD) technique was used to deposit silica, boron-doped silica, and silica/alumina coatings onto unreacted, internal tin Nb3Sn wire as electrical insulation.  These coatings were found to insulate over 200 V under face-to-face contact breakdown voltage tests.  In Phase II, experiments will focus on optimizing the CCVD process parameters to deposit insulating coatings onto the internal tin multifilament single strands and Rutherford cables.  Mechanical properties of the coatings and the resultant coated wires will be investigated.  The reel-to-reel system will be fully automated and capable of coating practical lengths of wire for magnet fabrication.                      Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awaredee: The use CCVD to deposit thin, high modulus, high dielectric strength, and thermalmechanically compatible insulation to internal tin Nb3Sn superconducting strands and Rutherford cables should enable novel designs in superconducting magnet for the application of high field physics.  The CCVD process also could be used to produce multi-component ceramics because of its flexibly in doping and composing elements in the coating.  The CCVD process can be used to manufacture long-length wire because of its scalability.",

As a result, a fuel analyzer based onnear infrared vibrational spectroscopy which is capable of assessing fuel quality based on defined quality parameters will be developed.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION: (Applicant's abstract) Poisoning from ethylene glycol is a              potentially lethal medical emergency but can be treated effectively when             recognized early. Conversely, when diagnosis is late, the outcome is usually         poor. The major pathogenic factor is metabolic acidosis from glycolic acid           (glycolate). Because laboratory testing for ethylene glycol and glycolate is         severely restricted, timely diagnosis depends on comparatively nonspecific           physical signs and laboratory tests.                                                                                                                                      Lack of access to specific testing and need for differentiation from conditions      featuring similar symptoms constitute a unique medical dilemma. Recognizing          these deficiencies we propose to develop novel, specific enzymic assays for          ethylene glycol and glycolate. Two product configurations are perceived: 1)          aqueous reagents for existing clinical analyzers (serum, quantitative); 2) a         dry-chemistry, dual-analyte point-of-care testrip method (whole blood,               semi-quantitative).The POC method is a dual-analyte test tab device for the          simultaneous estimation of ethylene glycol and glycolate from approximately two      (2) microliters of whole blood without centrifugation or any other form of           sample or reagent handling. To make such a level of miniaturization and              simplicity feasible, we have developed a capillary fill sampling technique           permitting specimen dosing, plasma separation, and red cell removal in one           wholly integrated step. Because of rapid metabolism of (flontoxic) ethylene          glycol and the longer half life of (toxic) glycolate, the latter provides            better prognostic information and improved clinical sensitivity, especially          late post-ingestion. Thus, rapid and simultaneous availability of test results       for both analytes expands the window of diagnostic/therapeutic opportunity.          Socioeconomic benefits are: 1) reducing expensive gas chromatographic                screening, confirmatory and other testing; 2) averting late or unnecessary           treatment; 3) cutting intensive care and hospital stay; 4) abating long term         morbidity (renal dialysis).                                                          PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  Most current gas chromatographic screening and confirmatory methods for ethylene glycol   require derivatization, sample pretreatment and special columns.  Direct methods are fraught  with analytical problems such as peak overlap and trailing.  Cases have been reported where  other compounds were identified as ethylene glycol with serious consequences.  All methods  require specialized equipment unavailable in most laboratories, are technically demanding,   time consuming, and relatively insensitive.   For these reasons access to timely and reliable  testing for ethylene glycol is extremely limited.  Testing for the clinically more sensitive and  relevant toxic metabolite glycolic acid is essentially non-existant.  Not a single routine clinical  analyzer currently exists offering either an ethylene glycol or glycolate method.  The   proposed products would solve these problems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         IR sensors are extremely valuable tools for a vast array of applications in areas ranging from astronomy to national security. The advancement of multi-waveband IR detectors faces serious hurdles due to the interconnection between the sensor elements andthe electronics substrates. The interconnect technology has emerged as the limiting factor in the signal processing and durability of these multi-waveband sensors. These problems are sometimes caused by the fill factor of the interconnect between thedetector and the electronics substrates, and/or the size of the interconnect metal (indium bump). The objective of this research project is the continued development of the interconnect technology from Phase I. MBI's goals are to produce an industrialinstrument for this novel interconnect-technology and to assemble a functioning IR detector array with 320x256 elements. This surpasses the proposal call goals. MBI assembly process utilizes the advantage of high-frequency electromagnetic waves to bondsemiconductor substrates. This process should enhance the performance of these detectors while lowering their production cost.Commercialization of IR sensors for many civilian and military applications require constant development to enhance performance and reduce costs, MBI's new technology presents an opportunity for such advancements in this as well as other high-technologyareas (e.g. MEMS).",

The CCEB will provide high-frequencyelectron bunches by combining the features of novel microscopic vacuum triodes with the he robust and reliable solid-state technology.  It should provide order of magnitude improvements in size, frequency and power over state-of-the-art counterparts.During Phase I we performed experimental dc and pulsed emission testing of a set of 1-mm diameter cold-cathodes and obtained stable emission currents as high as 120milliamperes.  During Phase II we propose to develop a compact CCEB buncher prototypeoperating at 2.85 GHz capable of delivering 10 Kilovolt, 30-100ma electron bunches.  A microstrip line matching network will be employed to efficiently couple microwave power into the CCEB's gate.  We will use a set of newly conceived diagnostics formeasuring the length of the electron bunches.  The CCEB, once fully developed, should provide order of magnitude improvements in frequency, size and power performance over existent technologies by using a miniature gated cold-cathode which eliminates theneed for heating elements and yields a super-fast turn-on microwave-driven electron source.  The CCEB is a very compact, high-speed electron buncher that should be able to provide narrow high-frequency electron bunches for many applications.  Of particularinterest are electron accelerators and millimeter-wave sources for airborne radar, satellite communications, wireless television and communications, cellular telephones, and the microwave power module.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Mide is proposing to develop actuators based on Ferromagnetic Shape Memory Alloy(FSMA).  FSMA's are a new class of actuator materials showing the large strains of shape memory alloys with faster response.  This is due to their magnetic, rather than thermalenergy input.  Phase I experiments concluded that Ni-Mn-Ga FSMA had the potential to achieve strains up to 6% under the influence of a magnetic field.  Further developments in the field have included successful modeling of the material's response toapplied fields and development of a prototype linear actuator.  Phase II will address the further application of this technology and the development of material production methods suitable for larger volume.In Phase II Mide will take the technology out of the laboratory and into application.  Mide has partnered with Sturman Industries in developing applications for this material.  Mide has also partnered with ETREMA to develop single crystal processingmethods suitable for high volume production.  The Phase II research will develop FSMA from an exciting new material into a viable actuator technology.  This technology will bridge some of the gap in active materials between slow, high strain shape memoryalloys and fast, low strain piezoelectric and magnetostrictive.  The new material will open new markets such as pumping to active materials where presently piezoelectrics and magnetostrictives have strain insufficient to overcome the copressibility ofdissolved gassed, and shape memory alloys are too slow.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is focused on developing nanotechnology reagents and tools for the emerging field of proteomics. The technology is modular. This means that universal reagents are produced to which an end-user can, in a simple step, attach any protein or antibody for a variety of biological assays. The detection technology under development is electronic. Electronic detection can be readily multiplexed for high throughput assays. Large numbers of experiments can be simultaneously analyzed, over short periods of time, using state of the art electronics techniques like time-division multiplexing. Since the output of the technology is electronic, massive data sets can be directly transferred to bioinformatics systems for automated analysis and storage. The technology uses cheap off the shelf components coupled with proprietary state of the art, nanotechnology reagents. The speed and multiplexing capabilities of the technology make it orders of magnitude less expensive than existing or competing technologies. The technology will be tailored to the special needs of proteomics: the study of the function of the gene products, proteins. With the sequencing of the human genome nearing completion, the need for tools to facilitate the study of proteomics is a high priority near-term application. Pharmaceutical companies would use this technology to identify families of proteins that are implicated in disease and construct databases that define networks of interacting proteins to determine points of intervention and potential drug targets. End-users will prefer to use the proposed technology because it will be more cost effective, sensitive, faster and flexible enough to adapted to many user applications.",

These technologies will, for the first time, enable         effective, high throughput drug screening that will identify novel compounds         that block ligand-receptor interactions on the surface of live cells. We will        target specific cell surface receptors that have been implicated in                  tumorigenesis, metastasis and angiogenesis. A second in vitro nano-based             technology will be extended to screen for synthetic mimics of protein-based          drugs, such as antibodies and natural products. These assays will be                 specifically developed to identify synthetic mimics of known angiogenesis            inhibitors, for which large-scale production costs may be prohibitive. Large,        chemically diverse drug libraries will be screened as a part of this project.        PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The technologies demonstrated in Phase I have significant commercial potential.  One  technology enables high throughput screening for a class of target receptors implicated  in cancer that have heretofore been difficult to assay in a relevant way.  The other  technology offers a direct approach to identifying synthetic mimics of drugs that are too  costly to produce in mass quantities.  The technologies are modular and thus easily adapted  to facilitate screening of a wide variety of targets without further modification to the   platform technology.  Both the technologies as well as any drug leads identified would be  of extreme interest to pharmaceutical companies.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         We have developed the first practical assay that directly measures the incorporation of beta-amyloid peptides into aggregates. We have multiplexed the technology to enable the screening of hundreds of thousands of drug candidates for their ability to directly inhibit beta- amyloid aggregation. Because the assay is rapid and does not use toxic substances, it can readily be extended to a whole cell assay. Cells that secrete beta-amyloid can be treated with drug candidates that might inhibit upstream elements such as beta- or gamma-secretase. The amount of secreted beta-amyloid would then be quantitated by our proprietary methods. Preliminary experiments performed on CSF from Alzheimer's patients show that the extent of beta-amyloid aggregation, detected by our technology, scaled with the measured degree of dementia and duration of disease, indicating that a clinical diagnostic assay based on this technology is feasible. The ability to quantitatively assess a patient's response to therapy would expedite clinical trials and FDA approval. Although we have optimized our technology for Alzheimer's disease, the assay is modular and is readily adapted to the specific detection of any neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by abnormal protein aggregation. These include, Alzheimer's. Parkinson's, Huntington's, Creutzfeldt Jakob, Lou Gehrig's and Mad Cow disease. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: We have developed the first specific and sensitive high throughput assay that detects abnormal-protein aggregation characteristic of neurodegenerative diseases. The assay is orders of magnitude more sensitive and specific than the state of the art and has been used to identify a new class of structurally related drugs that inhibit early stage beta-amyloid aggregation, characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. These structural determinants can be used by pharmaceutical companies to generate new combinatorial drug libraries focused on early stage AD. The assay is modular so it can be readily adapted for use in assays that target other neurodegenerative diseases. We will use our technology to develop a more sensitive diagnostic for AD.",

Under Phase I, the theoretical foundation for the new hardening technique was thoroughly developed. The resulting theorywas applied to several typical system topologies to study the feasibility of imbedding the penetration port protection into the enclosure port.  A complete design methodology was developed and documented.  This design methodology will be utilized in thePhase II demonstration effort where full scale imbedded protection devices will be produced and tested.  A prototype enhanced wave guide below cut-off penetration protection device designed in Phase I and potential antenna port applications will beperformed under Phase II.  The anticipated result of the proposed approach is the development of a new protection technique which will integrate penetration port hardening into the enclosure port (e.g. shield).  If completely successful, the new protectiontechnique will be imbedded in the enclosure port but the protection concept will also be developed for non-imbedded applications.",

One way to bring radiation hardening to an advanced electronic product on a cost-effective basis is to leverage the built-in radiation hardness of a commercialprocess technology.  NV flash EEPROM memory technology is popular in the commercial marketplace, with densities up to 256 Mbit in production.  Unfortunately, flash EEPROM memory is not available, at any density, in total dose rad hard versions.  And, mostcommercial flash EEPROM memories are so soft that impractical amounts of shielding are required to survive even moderate radiation environments.  This effort will be an important step in developing rad hard flash EEPROM technology at a commercial fab.  Radhard flash EEPROM technology will be a near-term solution to the problem of high density NV memory for space application.  It will enable the development of rad hard flash EEPROM memories and embedded NV memory for rad hard ASICs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Atmospheric turbulence adversely affects imaging systems by causing a randomdistribution of the index of refraction of the air through which the lightpropagates.  We show that tactical Army infrared sensing systems are not affected byturbulence in the same way as astronomical imaging systems, but the influence ofturbulence can still be quite strong.  Rather, the shape of the point spread functionassociated with the scene varies significantly across the image field-of-view.  Thiscondition is referred to as anisoplanatic imaging.  Fortunately, the overall effectof turbulence within a given isoplanatic patch is not as strong as in theastronomical imaging case due to shorter optical paths and longer wavelengths.  Tiltand low order turbulence modes will dominate the aberration experienced withinindividual isoplanatic patches, greatly simplifying the image reconstruction problem.In Phase I we demonstrated an approach for mitigating the type of aberrationsdescribed above.  The results of the Phase I show that an approach based on blockmatching techniques is capable of significantly enhancing the resolution and removingthe distortions caused by the non-isoplanatic turbulence conditions.  Thesedistortions and blurring are time varying and our demonstrated algorithm is effectivein removing these temporal effects.  In Phase II we propose to develop and demonstratea hardware-based system for implementing in real time the image reconstructionalgorithm.",

Currently, the greatest need in navigation is jamming resistant technology.  Narrowband sources of interference can easily be countered using nonlinear adaptive frequency domainfiltering/processing techniques, namely frequency domain excision (FFT-based excision).

The proposed approach will not only lead to the development of innovative and superior forms of matter, but will createinnovative and integrated processing techniques that combine advanced tooling and in-situ monitoring as well.  The proposed work will also generate a database of processing parameters that is vital for further advancement of the materials processing field.Micromachining will be used to directly create features in certain substrate materials that are sufficiently detailed to produce materials on the meso-scale.  Tooling to mass-produce such meso-materials will also be fabricated by similar micromachiningprocesses.  Both the tools and the meso-materials will be characterized by micro-Raman spectroscopy to monitor laser/matter interactions as a result of the micromachining process. The techniques and materials developed in this proposal will find numerouscommercial and military applications such as photon band gaps, direct-write electronics, and sensors.

This reactor technology uses agitation produces by a mechanical transducer that radiates high levels of acoustic energy, enhancing mass transport and fiber disaggregation in the chemical pulping of agricultural residues. The intense acoustic energy pulses are the driving force for micromixing and pumping of reagent into the straw fiber. In Phase I of the project, this method of agitation was demonstrated to accelerate oxygen delignification of medium consistency kraft softwood brownstock pulp without damaging the fibers. In addition, work was completed that successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the agitation for the pulping of wheat straw. Current agri-pulping reactor technology is unsuitable for producing fibers for fine papermaking because consistently high yields of easily bleached pulp cannot be obtained. The reactor technology will be combined with an existing chemistry that is successfully employed in converting agricultural cereal grain straw into bleached pulp for manufacture of fine writing paper. The chemical technology developer is teaming with Montec Research to develop a substantially improved process technology at the pilot scale for economically converting straw into valuable bleached pulp.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         All phases of full-mission simulations (FMS) are supported by software tools except the most critical - planning.  The use of Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) technology in the military materiel acquisition process and increasing complexity of DISwill make it harder to plan valid tests..  A FMS literature review and, interviews with FMS experts made it clear that a planning tool will add to FMS efficiency and reduce the risk of invalid data and wasted time and money.  MTI will build aknowledge-based FMS planning, development and analysis tool (FMS-PDAT) that will organize system test design data, highlight inter-system differences, select appropriate levels of realism, support scenario development and generate suggested performancemeasures.  MTI will conduct knowledge acquisition and participatory design sessions with expert FMS planners to specify detailed system functionality.  To ensure system developmental flexibility, the Use Case Driven approach to Object-Oriented SoftwareEngineering (OOSE) will be used for the system software development architecture.  A prototype FMS-PDAT will be applied in an Army FMS, and the design iterated based on feedback.  The PC based FMS-PDAT will be useful in all technology test venues that usevirtual simulation.  Users include the Army Battle Laboratories, the National Training Center, and emergency preparedness exercises.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project continues research and development aimed at demonstrating the feasibility for automatic video tracking of the motion of animals and humans in unconstrained environments. The Phase I study succeeded by designing low-level intelligence into predictive search algorithms that were able to confine their search for the correct position in a succeeding image to specific, small regions predicted by the system. The objective is to create a software system, easily operable by an unsophisticated user that can quickly and accurately track multiple points or regions of a moving animal or human through a sequence of video images. This tracking can be done despite background clutter and intermittent occlusion, and without attaching any distinguishing markers to the subject. In Phase I, a user interface was designed that allowed the user to choose a 'skeletal template' to be tracked with a pointing device (a mouse) by selecting vertices of closed polygons and connected rotation points. By sensing the direction and speed of motion of the system, the model-based tracking algorithm told the search mechanism where it should look in the next image to match a 'trailing template' derived from previous locations and orientations of the template. In Phase II, more sophisticated modeling and prediction algorithms, including supervised learning of constructed models, and a pyramided coarse-to-fine scale-space, constructed at video load time, will be brought to bear that will increase speed and efficiency of the tracking algorithm and improve the robustness of the model-based approach. At the same time, the user interface will be redefined to improve the 'look and feel' and give it a more intuitive structure. Applications for this software have a ready market demand. Present commercial tracking technology of biological motion requires the placement of intrusive control targets at critical positions on the subject. The commercial need for tracking and characterizing general biological motion will be exploited, including tools for animal behavior analysis, and predicting and improving motion efficiency in athletes. In addition, this technology has applications in diagnostics and medicine/health applications, surveillance, and other uses ranging from NASA's space research, to ergonomic design, to the fingering of musical instruments",

With the emergence of cluster computing, there  are many opportunities to connect diverse parallel programming  Environments based on the MPI programming model; currently interoperation  is almost non-existent between such Environments. The IMPI standard by  itself addresses basic interoperability, and the results of this effort  will drive performance of collective communication higher, in order to  promote wider use of interoperable MPI for demanding performance  situations. Interestingly, the practical support for high performance  interoperable MPI's, and collective operations places important Technical  constraints on the underlying MPI implementations, including the ability  to handle multiple network protocol stacks efficiently (called \"devices\"  in MPI nomenclature). Proposer's underlying technology is particularly  suited to adaptation to this task, moreso than are public-domain  implementations of MPI.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         It is proposed to continue development of a novel concept for space power generation based on coupling of a Pulse Detonation Rocket Engine (PDRE) with a magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) generator.  This highly efficient chemical power generation approach allowsfor deployment of clusters of satellites, thus increasing the survivability and operability of the defense system.  The proposed PDRE-MHD can also be used for efficient space propulsion, allowing the satellite to perform orbital change maneuvers.  Theconcept is low-cost, extremely robust, and (through a multiple-tube design) highly tolerant to component failure.  The Phase I studies demonstrated its viability and indicated the generator performance can be significantly higher than that of aconventional rocket-MHD system when accounting for all system operations.  The unique operating characteristics of the PDRE may also provide ways for even greater performance increase.  This Phase II effort proposed to experimentally demonstrate thetechnology and optimize and individual PDRE-MHD device.  A system engineering study will lead to final design of the complete orbital platform.  Besides low-cost, efficient space power generation, other applications include advanced space propulsionconcepts, which have a significant commercial potential.  The proposed research and development will be leveraged with a complementary National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-funded project.  The PDRE-MHD concept is a revolutionary approach tochemical-MHD power generation.  The technology provides the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) with a low-cost, dual-use, highly efficient and flexible design for an orbital power-generating platform.  The technology also has applications inadvanced space propulsion technology of interest to NASA, as well as large commercial development potential.",

MMS will develop an automated WEB-based delivery, tracking and           reporting system to deliver CME credit training via the Internet. Primary care       physicians (gatekeepers) need cancer control training to reduce cancer               mortality/morbidity. Currently, this type of training is not easily                  accessible.                                                                                                                                                               In Phase I, MMS will design/produce one pilot module that will undergo               targeted assessment by a select group of nationally recognized CME experts. It       will then be reviewed by a focus group of primary care physicians.  Formative        research will provide clear guidance to develop the design criteria and model        for completing the remaining 9 modules. An Expert Review Panel will oversee          the development.                                                                                                                                                          During Phase II, the 9 remaining CME modules will be developed under this            grant. Two additional modules will be developed through alternative funding.         The completed courseware, consisting of 12 cancer-specific CME modules, will         undergo a statistically valid field evaluation. The completed courseware will        reside on an innovative WEB-site utilizing proprietary compression technology        to permit full-motion video, high quality graphics and audio.                        PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  Based on the 15 year experience of the Texas Medical Association (TMA) in providing CME  to Texas primary care physicians, demand for this courseware will be high.  TMA will  provide this training to Texas physicians through their WEB site and MMS will market it to  the rest of the country and would through a commercial WEB site.  Also MMS will license  the course to other medical associations, health organizations and commercial outlets.  Profits will be shared among TMA, MMS and BearSoft.  The 4-year revenue projections  exceed 10 million dollars.  If only 1/3 of sales projections are met, this would still be an  outstanding small business success.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The U.S. Army has a critical need to protect its expanding Ethernet-based networks deployed around the world.  But, as the Government moves quickly to implement commercial protocols and standards for packet-based network-centric solutions for sensitiveinformation distribution, available options to protect this information are insufficient and costly. Designed only to protect data flowing across dedicated point-to-point connections, the Government's legacy cryptographic equipment is inefficiently suitedfor today's Local Area Network (LAN) environments-specifically Ethernet.In Phase I of our research into Low-cost Ethernet Encryption solutions, we analyzed four Ethernet technologies: 10 MBPS Ethernet (802.3); 100 MBPS Fast Ethernet (802.3u); Wireless Ethernet (802.11); and 1000 MBPS Gigabit Ethernet (802.11).  Phase Iresulted in a Low-cost Ethernet Encryptor (LCEE) architecture that complements all four technologies.In Phase II, a prototype model will be designed, constructed, and demonstrated.  Implementing an innovative approach that maximizes use of standard commercial Ethernet products, the prototype will provide high-grade encryption protection with VirtualPrivate Network (VPN) interoperability.  Beyond applications within the Army, low-cost commercial cryptographic Ethernet VPN products could also fulfill a variety of functions, worldwide, in home, business, and government settings.",

Currently, E-2C, S-3B, P-3Cand EP-3 aircraft are used to support the Navy's ISR primarymission.  Over time, the ISR task has dramatically increased butbudget limitations has prevented the Navy's ISR capability fromincreasing beyond using these same approaches and same aircraft.Only a lower cost approach would allow the new increased ISRmission to be met while not increasing its allotted budget.With the development of low cost Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) andsmall low cost payloads, a means is available to address thesenew requirements without significant cost increases.  Even thoughdevelopment of UAVs has progressed, the development of small lowcost, lower power ISR payloads still need to be developed.  Inthis proposal a Maritime ISR system is described that uses theGPS satellite signals in a bistatic system architecture forsurveillance.  This architecture is completely passive andleverages advances in GPS electronics to provide a low cost, lowpower ISR solution for Maritime applications. Under the proposedPhase II effort a prototype GPS ISR sensor will be built andflight-tested to demonstrate the capability to detect maritimetargets of interest.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Studies and test data previously collected have shown that GPS tracking can be used for space vehicles at high altitudes, including up to geo-synchronous (GEO) satellite orbits.  GPS tracking could significantly simplify implementation of autonomousGuidance, Navigation, and Control (GN&C;) in upper stages and satellites.  Even without full autonomy, GPS tracking has the potential of shortening the orbit determination process by using a single contact to determine position after a satellite maneuver.Under Phase I of this SBIR a review was conducted of all space qualified GPS receivers and their flight experience and detailed design options were considered for a low cost, low power, lightweight, miniaturized design of a GbUE suitable for supportingmultiple space missions including GPS metric tracking during launch, orbit determination during transfer or geostationary orbits, and high accuracy navigation, attitude control and timing.  Under the proposed Phase II effort, we will design, build and testa brass-board GbUE based on a software reconfigurable architecture and demonstrate its performance during different space operational environments using a GPS signal simulator.",

Our design heavily leverages existing software and digital signal simulation components previously developed by NAVSYS which were used to prototype an AGHSsystem under the Phase I effort.  In addition to providing digital and RF signal simulation capability, the AGHS can also be used to record and play-back real-world GPS signals from field tests.Under Phase II, an AGHS will be built and delivered for test and evaluation by the 746th Test Squadron",

This effort is critically needed in order to develop commercially viable nanomaterials for applications in both civilian and military markets. As demonstrated during the Phase I research, nanomaterials, produced using the proprietary continuous process, possess the same chemical and physical properties as those prepared in a batchwise mode. The research is broad and spans a number of significant markets including decontamination technologies for military and civilian applications, improved catalysts and catalytic supports, industrial gas scrubbing, and active ingredients for high efficiency air and water purification systems. Each of these market applications represents an initial subset of the market opportunities for these highly reactive nanomaterials",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Reactive gases such as fluorine present a significant safety and health threat.  Despite this, large quantities of these gases are used in a variety of industrial, medical, military, and aerospace applications.  Their toxic nature requires accurate andefficient monitoring during manufacturing, transportation, storage, and end use.The goal of this project is to develop a miniaturized sensor and associated monitoring system that can detect low levels of reactive gases in real time.  Such a system is of prime importance for detecting/locating fluorine leaks in high-power excimer lasersystems used in military weaponry.  During Phase I, NRC successfully demonstrated concept feasibility. The resulting sensors offer a combination of low cost and high performance that is not achievable with SOA electrochemical or solid-state fluorinesensors.  The Phase II challenge is to further develop and optimize performance, fabricate prototypes for extended testing, and address packaging of the end product.We anticipate annual sales over $600K from this SBIR technology, providing a significant return on the DOD investment (350%) within a few years.  Coupled with our existing expertise in gas sensors, NRC projects annual sales over $15M within the next fiveyears.",

The proposed carbon dioxide detector will enable expanded monitoring of carbon dioxide levels to enhance DOE studies on carbon cycle processes.  Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of using a common low-cost manufacturing process to produce a novel type of solid electrolyte sensor for the detection of CO2.  The sensor response to carbon dioxide was characterized in the laboratory and responded very well.  Phase II will optimize the sensor and fabrication method developed in Phase I, package the sensor, develop instrumentation to control the sensor, provide a standard output in response to gas, and characterize prototype detectors under laboratory and field conditions.                      Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The sensor should have application in a range of commercial markets including industrial health and safety, indoor air quality monitoring, environmental engineering, and industrial process control.

The major constituent of the cathode in state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries is lithium cobalt oxide power, which amounts to anestimated $ 300 million/year in terms of power market.  In Phase I, using our patented vapor phase process, we developed a new class of kinetically stabilized nanostructured powders wherein discrete metastable oxide nanoparticles are formed.  The energydensity of these powders was greater by 30-60%(depending upon the test conditions) than that of both coarse powders of the same composition, as well as state-of-the-art lithium cobalt oxide powders.  Capitalizing on the Phase I innovation, and matchingfund support from out collaborators who are world leaders in Li-batteries, in Phase II, we propose to develop cathode materials that will lead to Li-ion batteries with an exceptional energy density (~250Wh/kg) and long cycle life (>250).

The silicon based technology allows many material systems to be used that cannot be used in traditional glass microchannel plates due to the temperature processing requirements. In particular, the silicon technology allows high secondary yield materials to be used on the front end of the microchannel plate to enhance the first strike statistics, improving both device gain and increasing noise immunity. Phase I will explore front end engineering of silicon microchannel plates by applying a high secondary yield coating to the front end of a silicon microchannel plate. Phase II will further develop the engineering of silicon microchannel plates and investigate the use of other high secondary yield front end coatings.",

The roomtemperature and pressure ESA coating process consists of alternate adsorption of anionic and cationic molecules from water solutions to form multilayer coatings monolayer-by-monolayer.  Selection of the molecules in each monolayer, and the order of themonolayers through the coating, allows excellent control, combination and grading of multiple properties, including electrical conductivity, dielectric constant and loss tangent, thickness, optical transmissivity, abrasion resistance, thermal robustness,and electric field-controlled properties.  ESA films may be dipped or sprayed under ambient conditions to conformally coat surfaces of virtually any size or shape, without the need for vacuum chamber confinement.  The Phase I program has demonstrated thefeasibility of synthesizing conformal multilayer coatings possessing the primary functionality target, electrical conductivity.

Although plastics constitute only about 9 percent by weight of municipal solid waste, they occupy approximately one-fourth the volume of the waste stream. The U.S. EPA recommends recycling of plastics as the best solution to the problem. However, contamination of plastics within the recycle stream by foreign materials is a major impediment to widespread plastics recycling. Post-consumer recyclables are of inherently low value in the marketplace and have to compete with low-cost mass- produced virgin materials. Consequently, for recycling of plastics to be economically viable, it is necessary that processing systems for recycled plastics be highly efficient and low cost. Efficient, high-speed sorting technology has been developed recently by National Recovery Technologies (NRT) to remove troublesome contaminant polymers from plastics during processing for recycling. A remaining significant problem is the presence of small metallic contaminants in the plastics stream, which cause considerable problems to the processor during the extrusion of recycled plastics in making new products. Removal of these metallic contaminants using existing technology has proven to be difficult and expensive. The Phase II research is directed toward development of an efficient, cost-effective technology for small metals detection and removal from the recycled plastics stream and for integrating this technology into a shared resources environment with NRT's FlakeSort - high speed polymer sorting technology based on the information obtained during Phase I.",

The proposed innovation is based on nonlinear indicialtheory and on a recently developed identification tool allowing the extraction of a system's impulse response kernel from essentially arbitrary data.  Using this approach, the Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of predicting B-2 system responses tolow-level pulse excitation.  The proposed Phase II effort will further validate the method in the nonlinear regime.  This will be accomplished through data analysis of existing large amplitude pulse tests, small scale laboratory testing, and acquisition ofintermediate scale model airplane data.  Phase II will result in deliverable software and cost effective nonlinear system identification procedures with the potential to accelerate CW testing in a significant way.  This innovation will save the governmenta considerable amount of money by reducing test time, while allowing a quantitative assessment of airplanes which are subject to EMP hardness requirements.",

This system will automatically collect and store calculation data, such as input values, grid parameters, and solution quality measures, and will store this information as text, numerical data, and graphics in a structured database. The data will be tagged with further information that defines the calculation context. The reporting mechanism will allow users to request relevant information, and it includes a method for integrating data from a variety of sources so they can be viewed in a multidimensional design space. The goal of this work is to demonstrate the concept by developing a preliminary version of the system. The technology for developing each component and the integration of these components will be addressed. The result will be a system that provides an automated means of determining and archiving both calculation input information and solution assessment information; thus it can greatly reduce the labor required for manual documentation. It also provides a means of retrieving and presenting relevant information in a report format so that it can be easily interpreted by the user. This system will benefit NASA or any organization that performs numerous engineering calculations.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The objective of this proposal is to apply a new high-order accurate in space computational approach in the OVERFLOW code in order to resolve the essential features of helicopter flowfields more efficiently. The potential of the proposed method to improve resolution of tip vortices and rotor wakes at reduced computational cost will be demonstrated. The innovative aspect of the method is that the highorder of accuracy of the implicit operators is obtained at very little additional computing cost by applying compact space discretization. The proposed method yields timeaccurate numerical solutions of the inherently unsteady helicopter rotor flowfields more efficiently than current methods. Tests for time integration of wavetype andinviscid flow problems showed that the new, implicit, highorder accurate in space method is superior in terms of achieved accuracy versus computational cost when compared with classical secondorder accurate in space implicit methods. The ADI highorder method will be extended to curvilinear meshes and viscous flows to obtain solutions for realistic problems. In Phase I, the method will be implemented in the OVERFLOW code and the vortex blade interaction problem will be solved and in Phase II solutions of helicopter flowfields will be obtained.",

Hemophilia B. a devastating and costly (over a billion dollar market)      disease characterized by spontaneous internal bleeding. The planned experiments      will provide a cell therapy delivery vehicle for implantation into a large           vessel of an animal. and eventually, a patient suffering from this genetic           defect. Specific Aim 1 plans to test two IVD prototype fabrications for the          ability to support adequate myoblast cell number and FIX secretion rates to          achieve clinically significant FIX levels. Specific Aim 2 plans to optimize the      in vitro cFIX production rates of the selected D/D prototype. Specific Aim 3         plans to introduce this IVD prototype with autologous canine myocytes                transduced with hFIX gene into a normal dog where it will be secured in the          vena cava by a Greenfield filter anchor (GFA). The hemocompatibility of this         device within the vena cava, and myocytes viability will be assessed over            various periods of time (up to 6 weeks). Specific Aim 4 plans to test the cFIX       production rates and biological activity of cFIX transduced autologous canine        myoblasts in the cell IVD prototype in a Hemophilia B dog model. The successful      completion of these studies will provide 'proof of concept' for utilization of       the IVD as a gene therapy' treatment of hemophilia B. The ultimate goal is to        develop a novel cell and gene therapy delivery system (comprised of a                cell-filled IVD anchored by means of a Greenfield filter) that is introducable       and retractable via a percutaneous catheter insertion through the femoral vein       into the inferior vena cava. The IVD may be used to deliver any desired              compound via cell or gene therapy. This approach may be the key enabling             technology for both the gene therapy and cell therapy industries, providing a        safe means to implant a retrievable device to introduce gene products directly       into the systemic circulation of an individual with a genetic disorder.

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer, breast cancer,                 endometriosis and uterine fibroids are fairly common and serious diseases in         men and women. Their etiology is not fully understood, but all can be treated        by removal of endogenous gonadal steroid hormones, testosterone and estrogen.        This has led to the discovery of several successful pharmaceutical products          based on blocking the actions of the hypothalamic peptide,                           gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Down-regulation of the GnRH receptor by       peptide superagonists, or blockade by peptide antagonists, prevents pituitary        gonadotropin secretion and leads to dramatic reductions in gonadal steroid           production. GnRH-based drugs are now used extensively in these patients, as          well as for hormonal manipulation as part of assisted reproductive therapy or        for treatment of precocious puberty. Here we propose to develop orally active        small molecule antagonists of the GnRH receptor, in order to overcome many of        the limitations of these injectable peptide drugs and expand the clinical            utility of GnRH-based strategies. In Phase I we have used high-throughput            parallel organic synthesis to design multiple chemical series of highly potent,      nonpeptide GnRH antagonists. We have also established a series of in vitro and       in vivo assays to evaluate absorption, distribution and metabolism of these          compounds. In Phase II we propose a combination of parallel synthetic chemistry      and assay strategies to optimize pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties      of compounds from three of these series in order to produce compounds suitable       for clinical development.

(Nfl)      is developing a perfluorocarbon-containing artificial cerebrospinal fluid            (Revoxyn) that can deliver oxygen and other nutrients directly to brain tissue       even when vessels are occluded and cerebral blood flow compromised by ischemic       stroke, a \"brain attack.\" Preclinical studies demonstrated that ventricular          perfusion with Revoxyn reduces infarct volume by >90 percent and reverses loss       of EEG activity.                                                                                                                                                          In Phase I of this FAST TRACK SBIR application NTI will: 1) determine whether        single pass perfusion with Revoxyn delivered via the ventricle-to-lumbar spine       route is safe for patients with severe hemispheric ischemic stroke; 2)               determine to what extent the composition of Revoxyn changes during cerebral          perfusion in man; and 3) design, fabricate, and test on the lab bench a              prototype recirculating perfusion device suitable for preclinical safety             testing in vivo. Feasibility will be demonstrated if 1) the Revoxyn single pass      perfusion system is safe in man; 2) '75 percent of input perfluorocarbon is          recovered in the lumbar fluid; 3) the recirculating RDS-alpha prototype can a)       reliably maintain pH, C02 and 02 tensions of conditioned Revoxyn within              specifications for 24 h; b) run unattended without shutdown for 24 h; c)             successfully prevent delivery of Revoxyn at pressures >25 torr under conditions      of outflow restriction.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Restriction endonucleases are essential tools in genetic engineering, cloning and DNA diagnostics. N.BstNBI is a natural occurring nicking endonuclease which only breaks one strand of double-stranded DNA, and it is the only nicking enzyme that is commercially available. The proposed research is about engineering Type IIs endonucleases into nicking enzymes. In Phase I research, we have cloned and characterized the nicking endonuclease N.BstNBI and two related type IIs endonucleases, PleI and MlyI. Our results showed that type IIs endonucleases PleI and MlyI carry out double-stranded cleavage in a two-step process, in which the DNA is first nicked and then further cleaved on second strand by another enzyme molecule via dimerization. In the case of N.BstNBI, it is the dimerization function that was probably affected by mutation, resulting in a unique endonuclease which nicks DNA. We have successfully converted MlyI into a nicking endonuclease by disrupting its dimerization function. Thus, we have demonstrated that it is possible to convert Type IIs endonucleases into nicking enzymes by mutations. We will apply the techniques used in Phase I as well as additional strategies to convert more Type IIs endonucleases into new nicking enzymes. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Potentially can lead to the conversion of type IIs restriction endonucleases into nicking enzymes which have great applications in DNA amplification technology (SDA, RCA) and research (DNA replication, repair, etc.).",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Americans are coming to realize that our        typical diet is unhealthy - that we tend to consume an excess of food that are       dense in calories, e.g., fats and sugar, and are high in sodium, and too little      of foods that are dense with nutrients and fiber, e.g., fruits and vegetables        and whole grains. The importance of these dietary choices increases as we age -      for example, with changes in metabolism, body composition, nutrient absorption,      and energy expenditures. Yet, older people are especially likely to have             learned to select and prepare food in an era that preceded this knowledge, and       are increasingly likely to rely on processes or prepared foods. The specific         aims of this Phase II SBIR are: 1. to produce an innovative educational package      about healthy eating for older adults who prepare most of their meals. Such a        package is not currently available. This will involve (a) finalizing and             producing a video kit (25-minute video and printed materials) for participants,      and (b) developing and producing a training manual for facilitators to use the       kit in a 2-hour workshop. 2. To rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of using       the package in a workshop in improving participants' diet.                           PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: NOT AVAILABLE",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project studies holographic data storage in a new ion-exchanged photochromic glass disk. It is well known that holographic data storage can significantly increase data storage capacity and reduce access time. However, the technology maturity of holographic data storage is believed to be impeded by: the lack of good holographic material that can be erased and recorded optically with almost unlimited rewriting cycles, with large index modulation for large capacity multiplexed data recording, and with long lifetime and immunity to destructive readout for archival applications. As demonstrated in Phase I the new ion-exchanged photochromic glass can satisfy all above requirements. In addition, it does not require developing or fixing after hologram recording making it an attractive candidate to replace other holographic materials in holographic storage applications. The Phase II research will first explore techniques to increase the recording volume thickness. The holographic performance parameters will again be determined after the thickness improvement. A compact holographic storage system will then be designed and constructed to show the effectiveness of disk type storage application. High capacity storage will be demonstrated. Commercial development will be explored with some major storage companies. Using the new ion-exchanged glass can significantly improve the holographic data storage technology for commercial and military applications such as computer data storage, on-line storage, library archival applications, image storage and processing for medical applications and military target identification, and fast access to large intelligent databases.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         There is a need in both commercial and military applications for digital transmission methods that can operate at high data rates (several megabits per second end-user rate) in multi-user environments. Existing communication methods will be severelystressed by the difficulties of such an environment: Propagation anomalies such as multipath fading and various types of interference will require intensive digital processing to mitigate their effects. As data rates and environmental problems increase,the use of digital signal processing and error correction becomes costly and complex. Eventually, it will become impossible to degradation. Furthermore, existing multiple access techniques lack flexibility, and as users are added, the difficultiesincrease. By developing a digital signaling approach based on the control of the natural complexity of the chaotic behavior of rf devices, alternative solutions to these fundamental problems emerge.As a limited Phase II effort appropriate to the available funding level, we will develop a chaotic oscillator prototype that has improved behavior over the Colpitts circuit used in Phase I. The purpose of Phase I was to demonstrate the feasibility of suchchaos-based signal encoding (via control of an analog oscillator), and we demonstrated not only this, but also a new principle for amplifying communication signals with tremendous signal gain. In Phase II we will improve upon the oscillator design used inour Phase I effort. We will address such fundamental issues as signal performance in noise, signal predictability, oscillator efficiency, and spectral characteristics. We will also investigate frequency scaling, and the advantages of this approach overtraditional methods for digital communication.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NimbleGen will refine its proprietary           technology and manufacturing system into the Maskless Array Synthesizer System       (MAS Systems). The MAS System will permit owners to rapidly produce inexpensive      High Density Custom DNA Arrays (CDAs) in their own facilities to their own           specifications.                                                                                                                                                           NimbleGen builds its arrays using photo deposition chemistry with its                proprietary Maskless UV Light Projector. Texas Instruments Digital Light             Processor (DLP) is at the heart of the NimbleGen Projector. The DLP employs a        solid-state array of miniaturized aluminum mirrors to pattern up to 780,000          individual pixels of light. Next generation systems will produce up to 1.3           million pixels of light. The computer controlled fabricatoin process requires        no human interaction once the glass substrate is placed into NimbleGen's             proprietary reaction chamber. Fabrication occurs base-by-base inside the             reaction chamber, eliminating the need for the clean rooms common to other           array production processes. By using the Maskless UV Projector to control the        patterning of UV light on the glass in the reaction chamber, NimbleGen achieves      unparalleled precision and control over CDA fabrication. The MAS technology          also permits unsurpassed speed - a cycle time of less than four hours - in the       production of CDAs, thereby substantially reducing development time and costs.       PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  There is a clear need for an inexpensive, rapid, and reliable method of generating and  analyzing custom DNA arrays.  There are strong indiciations of the proposed project's  potential for commercialization, as follows:  The market for DNA arrays and DNA array  fabrication equipment is projected to be $318 million in 2001, growing to $1.7 billion in  2005, a CAGR of 49%.",

The framework is modular in design to allow the incorporation of newoptimization algorithms and analysis tools, as they become available. This framework will enable the design of new antennas that meet stringent performance requirements beyond what is feasible with current technology. This proposal describes thedevelopment of an Antenna Design Framework, which increases the performance of current analysis tools by combining them with a state-of-the-art optimizer. The resulting systems become high-performance, automated design tools. When compared to the currentlyavailable tools for antenna design, the new tools will have much greater flexibility, better performance, and will drastically reduce the amount of time required to develop an optimal antenna design. This will be useful in the design and placement of alltypes of antenna systems, both for military and commercial users. Military uses include location and interaction studies on ships, aircraft, satellites, and fixed stations. Commercial uses include wireless network providers, broadcasters, and otherservices that can benefit from optimal antenna design and placement.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         As part of Phase 1, Noise Control Engineering Inc (NCE) developed and documented algorithms that create a noise prediction tool tailored to ships.  This approach facilitates the prediction process and increases the accuracy over that achieved by existing'cook books' or software not specifically geared toward the unique features of ship constructions.  The shipbuilding industry presently does not have an established approach to acoustical design.  Phase 1 identified algorithms and methods that can remedythis situation.  Creating a modern program addressing the unique features presented in the marine environment solves these problems.The Phase 1 report identified the vessel's structural features that are considered as input data for the prediction process.  NCE's approach is to account for the universal and unique acoustic features of marine vessels.  The prototype program iscombination of Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) modeling approach, an acoustic architectural engineering model and empirical formulas and databases that have been verified and utilized over many years.  The algorithms consider the acoustic impact of manyfactors that are specific to marine vessels, including water loading of surfaces, finite size and orientation of mechanical sources in small compartments, hydrodynamic sources like propellers, thrusters, and splash noise.  The Phase 1 effort and theexisting prototype software showed applicability to all types and sizes of vessels - monohulls, SWATHs, hydrofoils, catamarans - constructed of various materials.These methods, documented in the Phase 1 effort and contained in the prototype program have proven to be very accurate in the prediction of machinery induced noise [3,4].  The Phase 1 effort identified modifications to improve and extend the program tocover HVAC induced noise.  Additional algorithms are needed to extend the capacity and accuracy of the existing prototype.  Phase 1 identified the need for a GUI for both the input and data output.  The proposed Phase II effort facilitates the input/outputprocess and includes additional source and material databases.",

The sensor technology is an amplifying fluorescent polymer coupled with a chromophore. The AFP has been demonstrated to detect trace elements of volatile chemicals in theparts per quadrillion range. This extreme level of sensitivity provides superior detection capabilities; further, because this capacity is achieved without the use of expensive, complex drive electronics, very low-cost systems are possible, especially withthe leverage of sacrificing some sensitivity for reduced costs and portability. The devices will be demonstrated using surrogate and actual CW agents.",

It is intended to employ this effect to produce a temperature-tunable optical filter suitable for development of a next-generation optical spectrum analyzer (OSA) for remotely monitoring dense wavelength division multiplexed (DWDM) networks. Such a device will greatly benefit the telecommunications industry by providing a means of embedded real-time monitoring of system operation and signal quality. This capability has the potential to virtually eliminate costly system failures. The plan for reaching the project goal is to develop a first-generation prototype and use this prototype to demonstrate the expected capabilities of a next-generation OSA. The initial application for the technology is as an embedded test and monitoring system for telecommunications fiber networks.

Sub-nanosecond switching will be demonstrated with these devices which are integrated with integrated circuit (IC) electronics. Fast IC electronics will be implemented using low voltage differential signaling (LVDS). SDT devices exhibit large signal, low switching field, and high resistance, which lead to high sensitivity, low power consumption, and small size and weight, when compared with giant magnetoresistive (GMR) devices. Fast SDT devices will require improvements in both magnetic speed and electronic speed, while existing attractive static properties need to be maintained. Phase II is expected to produce integrated SDT devices with state-of-the-art properties and switching time less than one nanosecond.

Phase I demonstrated that edge pinning techniques can be used to fabricate low hysteresis push-pull and shielded bridge sensors with designed bias points. Before the technology can be commercialized, Phase II research must: (1) develop hard edge resistor elements that minimize hysteresis and maximize signal; (2) optimize hard edge processing and implementation; (3) determine the viability of alternate pinning strategies; (4) develop specification, architecture, and physical designs for prototype sensor or isolator products; (5) fabricate target devices; and (6) characterize devices for magnetic and electrical responses. A fully developed magnetic field sensor and/or signal isolator is expected, one that is ready for commercialization. Potential commercial applications are discrete low hysteresis bridge sensors and isolators, improved digital magnetic switches, and ultra-low field sensors employing integrated circuit (IC) based feedback amplifiers",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The proposed innovation is a two-axis spin-dependent-tunneling (SDT) sensor which detects small magnetic signals for use in non-destructive evaluation (NDE) of defects in metallic materials and structures. The proposed SDT sensor offers several advantages for NDE eddy current detection methods: (1) High sensitivity. The ability to resolve fields of 10 nOe/root Hz or better, yet operate at room temperature, and have a broad band frequency response. (2) Two-axis magnetic field sensing. This allows vector determination of the magnetic signal in the plane of the detector. (3) Sensor arrays. Fabrication of the sensors uses silicon-based techniques, and therefore the sensors are small--roughly 2 mm on a side. Compact sensor arrays are possible and offer advantages for defect recognition and spacial determination without requiring the sensor to be scanned. Phase I will develop an innovative approach for fabricating a two-axis sensor on a single chip. The proposed sensor is suitable for many types of eddy current detection methods as well as suitable for position sensing. Phase II will use the sensor in the development of a sensing array for an eddy current NDE system.",

This Phase II proposal is directed towards designing, optimizing, manufacturing, and demonstrating several GMR and SDT eddy current probes and probe arrays specifically designed to detect varying crack depths,crack sizes, and surface configurations.   The design of the sensors used in these probes will be further optimized to maximize resolution and sensing depth based on the results of the Phase I project.  The sensors also include hybrids sensors using ASICchips for on-board signal processing or multiplexing.  The optimization of on-board excitation coils started in Phase I will also be pursued. We will continue our contacts with aerospace and other interested companies during this Phase II project.Commercialization of the technology is proceeding through the formation of a class S company, Albany Instruments, Inc., a subcontractor on this proposal.  At the end of the project we will have prototype sensors and sensor arrays designed to meet specificNDI applications.  These prototypes will be ready for Phase III commercialization.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This SBIR Phase II program will demonstrate prototype galvanic isolating  devices of high-speed/low-power by incorporating high-speed magnetic films  into giant magnetoresistive structures and by combining with high-speed IC  electronics. The new devices will have five important improvements over  existing devices, a factor of 10 faster, without a drive IC chip, a  flip-chip approach, a lower supply voltage, and without incidental  latching. High-speed magnetic films require less power to switch at the  same speed in the ns range. The elimination of the driver chip will lower  the power requirement, complexity and cost. Flip-chip technology will  enhance the yield and provide a fast way for prototyping new devices at a  low cost. A low voltage is intrinsic in reducing power and increasing  speed. These improved isolating receiver and transceiver devices will meet  the demand of the next generation high-speed data communications. Based on  the results achieved in Phase I program, we plan to fabricate spin valve  bridges using high-speed magnetic films, and make them compatible with  fast IC electronics. The end devices will have the state of the art static  properties, a high operating speed of 1 GBaud, a reasonably low budget,  and a low cost.",

Moreover, byestablishing a wireless network for a battlegroup, user access isgreatly simplified and the timeliness / diversity of applicationsexecuted on the ship is substantially enhanced.

The visualization of turbulent processes is an important tool in understanding the phenomenon.  In this project, a high repetition rate MegaHertz tunable Alexandrite laser will be used to excite an ion emission line in a plasma.  The resulting laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) will be imaged onto an ultra-fast imaging detector to reveal the temporal evolution of turbulent structures in the plasma with high spatial resolution.  In Phase I, several ions were investigated to determine the optimal species for laser-induced fluorescence visualization.  The MegaHertz Alexandrite laser was designed, based on the laser energy required for the selected ion species.  The expected signal and signal-to-noise were estimated based on a proposed experimental setup.  In Phase II, after delivery of the ultra-fast CCD camera and MegaHertz burst Alexandrite laser, a proof of principle experiment will be implemented.  This will be done on the Magnetic Reconnection Experiment (MRX) at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory.

        "abstract": "Abstract         60513      Breast cancer is one of the major public health concerns today in the United States.  However, the detection of breast cancer through mammographic screening is complicated by various anatomic factors that can hide or simulate tumors, leading to reduced sensitivity and specificity of mammography.  Consequently, the rate of false negatives is 5%-6%, which results in loss of lives.  The accuracy of mammography can be improved by complementing it with functional imaging techniques such as PET imaging.  This will require dedicated breast imaging PET scanners.  A high-resolution breast imaging PET scanner, consisting of LSO (lutetium silicate) scintillator crystals read out by avalanche photodiode (APD) arrays, is currently under development.  This project will develop a fast, low-noise integrated front-end chip (ASIC) for this scanner, specifically designed to read out the APD signals with high accuracy and low random background.  During Phase I, the feasibility of the proposed readout chip was demonstrated by designing, simulating, building, and testing discrete prototypes of the critical parts of the proposed chip (ASIC).  A preliminary design for the core parts of the readout chip was developed.  Phase II will finalize the chip design, create its silicon layout, and fabricate prototype chips.  Using these chips, prototype multi-channel LSO/APD/ASIC detector modules will be designed and built, and their performance will be evaluated for PET applications.                      Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: In addition to breast imaging, the proposed chip (ASIC) should be useful for any applications that require reading out APDs or multianode photomultipliertubes with fast and highly accurate timing.  This includes other PET imaging applications, such as animal PET.  Other applications include astrophysics, nuclear physics, and high-energy physics research, such as Compton scatter imaging detectors.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         60524         Existing neutron detector technology for neutron scattering instrumentation, used in materials research, is both expensive and limits the potential of U.S. researchers.   To effectively utilize neutron scattering instrumentation, highly efficient, high-count rate detectors are needed that exhibit good resolution over very large areas.  Furthermore, advanced neutron detectors will be critical components needed to fully make use of new intense neutron sources.  This project will develop new neutron detector technology based upon a electron multiplication technique, which can be exploited for next-generation epithermal neutron detection.   Ultimately, a large area, curved neutron detector, capable of microsecond pulse counting, parallax free, and with submillimeter position resolution will be developed.    Phase I fabricated and demonstrated an neutron-to-electron multiplier using a proprietary glass.  This was successfully coupled to fast pulse counting electronics to produce the first neutron images.   Manufacturing techniques were demonstrated that would allow large areas to be produced with curvatures to remove parallax distortion.   In Phase II, a large area neutron-to-electron multiplier, with enriched boron-10 composition for optimal gain in epithermal neutron detection, will be manufactured.  The detector will be coupled to position sensitive, pulse counting electronics and a computer readout.  The resulting prototype detector will be tested and characterized on a neutron beam used for neutron scattering instrumentation.                     Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: State-of-the-art neutron detectors should find application in neutron scattering communities worldwide.   The detector should be particularly useful at intense neutron source instruments, which are being developed at the Spallation Neutron Source for example, to enable researchers in all fields to increase productivity and expand research capabilities",

The MMI splitterswill be designed for the 980-nm window in such a way that the pump-shared outputs will be achieved through a cavity formed between a diode laser and a Bragg reflector at the input port.  The milestones of the Phase I program: the design and successfuldemonstration of 1 x64 MMI splitters in terms of power uniformity, fabrication, tolerance, polarization insensitivity and the alleviation of material internal absorption, will be considered in order to meet the requirements of the high performance fiberamplifying systems.  Fabrication reproducibilty of device will be unvestigated, prototype will be built, and pigtailing/packaging technologies will be developed.  The phase II progran will provide a simple and inexpensive approach to address the rapidlygrowing demand for amplifying, signal routing and high bandwidth in the optical communication market.",

It has theability to act as a wheeled robot to traverse terrain quickly, a crawling mode to enter buildings through narrow openings, the ability to articulate and is capable of pulling/ climbing using the manipulator arm. This self righting robot has the ability totraverse a wide range of environmental conditions such as: level ground, compound slopes, steps, ladders, downspouts, building debris, sand, rocks, and ice surfaces. The platform will have the ability to divide and act independently to gain access or covermore territory during a mission.

The group includes                    phosphatidylinositols (PtdIns) and its radyl and sphingo analogues. Members of       the group are critical intracellular signaling messengers, and important as          biomedical research reagents and for developing diagnostics and therapeutics         based on signaling modalities. Furthermore, inositolphospholipids are                biocompatible amphiphiles with applications in skin-care and intravenous drug        delivery formulations. No practical approach adaptable for economical large          scale production is available.                                                                                                                                            The overall objective of this investigation is to develop laboratory scale           methods of synthesis, potentially adaptable for economical larger scale              production, for preparing individual molecular species of PtdIns and analogous       inositolphospholipids. During Phase I, a novel approach, applicable to the           entire biological PtdIns group and tailored analogues, was experimentally            validated for PtdIns synthesis, and the structural and stereochemical integrity      of the products was established unequivocally. During Phase II, this approach        to synthesis will be optimized for ultimate economical larger scale production       of PtdIns, and extended to radyl, sphingolipid, thiophosphate and phosphonate        type analogues and selected diastereomers. Further, the approach will be             exploited for the preparation of selected inositolphospholipid molecular             species.    PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Not Available",

This will provide an open published standard for integration of this intelligent system with any diagnostic system (e.g. ICAS). Thus, the sensor system will be a value-added adjunct to an otherwise standard bearing.Prognostic algorithms, that are characteristic of the application, will be developed and validated in conjunction with the bearing manufacturer, and predictions of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) will be correlated with results of bearing tests-to-failure.Other required developments include packaging of the sensor microelectronics, and algorithm and software integration. Load sensor prototypes will be manufactured in low volume. Documentation for the wireless sensor system prototypes also will be producedin Phase II. Power harvesting capability also will be integrated. Having this capability will cause the sensor system to be essentially maintenance-free, as well as remove the need for a separate power source, which is not always available.

In addition to supplementing high-quality range data, these improved, angles-only data can also help reduceerrors in the current space-object maintenance catalog.The method for gaining highly accurate metric data lies within the data processing methodology called astrometry or in-frame metrics, where the position of the satellite is referenced directly tobackground stars defining the stellar coordinate system.  This approach eliminates most of the errors associated with the mount and atmosphere.  Oceanit was able to acquire plate solutions to six coefficients, thus allowing for sub-arcsecondmeasurements.The proposed Phase II system will integrate the breakthrough technologies developed in Phase I.  The proposed system has also been identified as a significant operational asset to be utilized in the missions of both Air Force ResearchLaboratory's Detachment 15, Air Force Maui Optical Station and Air Force SBIRS Defense Support Program-Shield/ALERT.",

A single COEO simultaneously generates100 more stable optical carriers on a precisely fixed grid that cannot drift (e.g. 25 GHz, 12.5 GHz, 1GHz, or any other desired spacing) and will replace at significantly lower cost the entire array of semiconductor lasers and associated frequencystabilization circuitry found in conventional DWDM transmitter systems. The COEO is a versatile, multi-functional component that also fulfills other high-performance UDWDM applications, including all-optical clock recovery, digital and analog datarecovery, and ultra-high spectral purity master optical clock synchronization and RF clock generation.  This SBIR project will leverage and extend technology developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and licensed exclusively to OEwaves.  We will focus ontransforming the basic design concept proven at JPL-embodied in shoebox-sized benchtop prototypes built from discrete optics-into an integrated devices that consumes less than 500 mW, fits in a conventional microelectronic package, tolerates vibration andshock, requires no input other than power, and lends itself to low-cost automated production.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         60059       A previously built Active Bragg Compressor (ABC) had been shown capable of rapid switching of 11.4 GHz microwave energy stored in a resonant cavity, in order to produce a compressed 50-100 nsec pulse with a peak power gain of 10-12.  However, the peak output power in the ABC was limited to about 100 MW due to spontaneous breakdown of the switch.  This project will develop a modified plasma switch to produce 500-700 NW output pulses, based on switch configurations for ABC that utilize resonators containing one or more discharge tubes, which alter the resonator transmission coefficient upon firing.  This allows the discharge tubes to reside, during the filling time of the compressor storage cavity, in an rf electric field that is less than one-third that of the initial ABC.  In Phase I, several designs for resonance plasma switches with self-breakdown characteristics superior to earlier models have been developed.  Numerical analysis was applied to each design to simulate operation.  Non-high-vacuum prototypes were fabricated, and measurements were made of their characteristics at low power level.  The measurements showed compression ratios in the range 10-15, stability of +0.3 in relative input-to-output phase variations, three-fold reduction in electric field at the switch, and energy efficiency in the range of 60-65%.   High-power tests will be conducted during Phase II, using output from an 11.4 GHz magnicon, to produce 500-700 peak power compressed pulses with compression ratios >10:1 and energy efficiencies >60%.                       Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: Thousands of rf pulse compressors could be required for Next Linear Collider, and these high-compression-ratio active compressors should be serious candidates for this application.  The value of this commercial market is in the range of $10 - $20 million.  Other applications of high-power, high-compression-ratio, active rf pulse compressors include industrial accelerators and short-pulse radars.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         60975         The wake field induced by passage of a high charge bunch along a dielectric-lined wavequide is attractive for high-gradient electron acceleration, such as used in high energy physics research, since no external source of radiation is needed.  Recently, it was pointed out that a train of short moderate charge bunches can be arranged to induce cumulative buildup of wake fields.  However, a long dielectric-lined waveguide, is required for a long bunch train, leaves the bunches susceptible to serious instability.  This project will develop a short dielectric resonator that would allow cumulative buildup of the wake fields, if the wake field reflections from both resonator faces could be synchronized with the period of the bunch train.  A short dielectric resonator could allow easier control of transverse beam instabilities than a long dielectric waveguide.  In Phase I, transverse instability was investigated for a bunch injected slightly off-axis in a dielectric-line waveguide, and a fair degree of stabilization was exhibited.  A simulation of longitudinal wake fields in a dielectric resonator exhibited zones adjacent to each face of the resonator where the wake fields did not resemble those calculated, unless axial boundaries were taken into account.  An experimental dielectric wake field resonator was designed and built, and a design for a beamline upgrade was developed, so as to increase the charge/bunch for future experiments.   Phase II will upgrade the beamline, including the installation of an alpha magnet to provide higher charge, tighter bunches, along with improved beam focusing into the dielectric resonator.  A beam chopper will be constructed to enable an adjustable short train of bunches to pass into the dielectric resonator.  Experiments will be performed to observe the cumulative build-up of wake fields from the bunch train.                     Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: High-gradient wake fields, induced by the passage of a train of moderate charge bunches, could be an alternative to large, expensive rf-driven systems for acceleration of electrons and positrons to high energy.  Significant acceleration in a dielectric resonator could open up sizable markets for future accelerator modules.",

Characterization of HLA gene at DNA level has become a crucial tool in identifying HLA compatible donor-recipient pairs for successful human organ/marrow transplantation. Here, we describe an advanced yet tangible method of HLA typing for the five major HLA loci, HLA-A, B, C, DRB, and DQB to accommodate the needs of clinical laboratories. The microsphere-based array platform has a unique combined advantage of DNA probe array, and flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and sample processing capability of flow cytometry. Multi-analyte DNA hybridization assay using a panel of HLA locus-specific probe is conducted and analyzed in a single reaction. In phase II period, we will continue and expand probe development for both low and high resolution typing of the five major HLA loci, develop sample amplification method, develop data analysis software, and rigorously validate the final system through beta-testing. Flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and automation potential of the proposed system is expected fulfill the existing needs of HLA typing at DNA level for laboratories involved in solid organ transplant as well as high throughput screening for the national bone marrow donor registry.

        "abstract": "Abstract         This project develops an information extraction system that demonstrates higher levels of recall than current systems, seeking not to jeopardize the levels of precision. Our recall enhancing algorithms use more linguistic and world knowledge than mostcurrent systems. Four crucial avenues of work that will lead to the improvement of recall are: disambiguation of input text terms through ontological semantic processing; processing reference; processing non-literal language; and assigning semanticfeatures to new, unattested word and phrase occurrences. All the above activities rely on a unique battery of resources and processes developed by or available to Onyx. These include an ontological world model, a fact database, a comprehensive NLP lexiconof English and an onomasticon, or lexicon of proper names. In addition, we use special routines for resolving reference, processing non-literal language through controlled constraint relaxation and treating unattested inputs using expectations recorded inthe ontology, the fact database and in special orthographic, morphological and syntactic rules. Architecturally, we will combine in a single system a variety of approaches and processes as above. Unlike most current systems, ours will be geared not only atinformation extraction for a given set of templates (and, therefore, typically, working in a single domain) but will also include facilities for modifying templates and defining new templates for new types of questions and, orthogonally, new domains. Thus,our product will be the first general-purpose, configurable information extraction system, which will in multiple domains and with multiple text genres. Additional resources and linguistic expertise for this project are supplied by consultants at NewMexico State University's Computing Research Laboratory, a premier academic R&D; institution.",

The project will continue to utilize the standard commercial modeling and simulation technology, OPNET Modeler, which is compliant with Government architecturerequirements and Open System Interconnection (OSI) standards including Synchronous Optical Network (SONET), and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM).  OPNET's proposed solution includes the research and development of a network model scenario at the new rangelocations to assess bandwidth utilization, bottlenecks in the current environment and the impact of deploying network technologies by a simulation expert.  Network models will be expanded from Phase I to include the modeling of mobile communications inaddition to the current fixed architecture and provide an interface with knowledge based network management systems.

Weight and volume savings come from replacement of copper wire andelectronic termination hardware in cable assemblies having large wire counts with optical fiber cables having small fiber counts.  Cost savings  are associated with the weight and volume savings and with integration of control, power and communicationsystems.  Reliability is enhanced through Electromagnetic Interference susceptibility reduction, multipath redundant communication lines and communication system simplifications which are part of an integrated vehicle management system design.

        "abstract": "Abstract         This proposal outlines a program to develop a complete Stokes polarization imaging system.  Although conventional imaging techniques have undergone fairly advanced levels of development, enabling low-level light detection, IR imaging, and high-resolutionimaging all at rapid frame rates, the techniques nevertheless are fundamentally constrained to detection of only the intensity and color of light.  Polarization imaging would allow additional information to be accessed, which is not possible byconventional imaging. Through the detection of polarization properties of light, in addition to the conventional intensity based information, polarization imaging would add a new dimension to imaging.The proposed polarization based imaging system is expected to significantly enhance the capabilities of object identification and differentiation, which will be very useful in target acquisition and identification particularly in difficult environments.For example, certain polarization states of light have been shown to be impervious to the effects of scattering by aerosols (smoke, fog, etc.). Polarization imaging can take advantage of this effect to enhance imaging through obscuring media. In addition,the light transmitted or reflected from an object has a polarization signature that offers means for identification of the material characteristics of the target object (e.g., ice on a wing surface).",

Traditionally space launches have been relatively infrequent, and most of the launches have used expendable launch vehicles. The use of reusable launch vehicles is expected to gain popularity for economic and environmental reasons, resulting in the National Airspace System (NAS) having to deal with the return flights as well as the launches. In view of these reasons, NASA and FAA need to extend their ATM research to address space flight traffic in the national airspace.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The goal of this Phase II program is to design, build, test, and deliver a compact, rugged, Open-Path Fourier Transform Infrared (OP-FTIR) spectrometer system.  This system will be able to work in the information-rich 8 to 13 micron region with a 16cm-1spectral resolution.  This resolution is a specifically tailored for identifying and quantifying heavy industrial solvent molecules with better sensitivity than a high-resolution spectrophotometer.  Our OP-FTIR system will be designed to combine lowmanufacturing cost with high sensitivity in a rugged, fieldable instrument.  In particular, the system incorporates a novel encoder-based metrology system to replace the He-Ne laser interferometer that is used in most FTIR systems, and it uses an uncooledmicrobolometer in place of the more traditional cryogenically-cooled Hg-Cd-Te detector.  These factors, combined with the 16cm-1 resolution and other design economies, will result in a system that is smaller and less expensive than competing systems thatare less sensitive in detecting the molecules of interest.  The program will include the development of computational algorithms to extract concentration x pathlength products for multiple molecular species, as well as the development of imbeddedprocessing to run the algorithms (allowing stand-alone operation).",

The goal of this Phase II program is tofabricate, test and deliver a low-cost, high-speed spatial light modulator that offers independent amplitude and phase (A&P;) control, which can used in a wide variety of defense and commercial systems.  Specifically, the device will offer either bipolar (relative phases of all output states are either 0 or pi radians) or gray-scale phase and gray-scale amplitude modulation. Ourmodulator design, whose feasibility was established in the Phase I program,is based on a sandwich of a transparent silicon VLSI active-matrix addresseddeformed helix liquid crystal amplitude modulator and a reflectivemicroelectromechanical (MEMS) optical phase-only modulator. Devicecharacterization involves testing to establish the spatial resolution, contrast ratio, phase dynamic range, and pixel crosstalk (both electrical and optical). The anticipated outcome of this Phase II program is a 128x128 pixel A&P; bipolar modulator with 72-micron pixels, a 4 kHz frame rate, an 80% fill factor, and PCinterface circuitry.

The LNAVSIM capability will provide inter-vehicle coordination capabilities for the Joint Interim Mission Modeling (JIMM) simulation environment. The Air Force is investigating ways to utilize simulation techniques to study largenumbers of offensive weapons such as the UCAV as a means to locate high-value, strategic, movable targets and deliver firepower. ORCA's Phase II focus will be on providing an environment designed to be an effective tool for evaluating command, control andoperations of large force structures involving many differing aircraft working in coordinated and collaborative ways. The goal being to assess the effectiveness of these systems when integral to a much larger force structure. Mission planning andsimulation for multiple flying vehicles in dynamic environments involves asset allocations, tiered tactics and collaborative strategies designed to accomplish goals of the mission, given the current knowledge available about the world. As knowledgechanges, the planning system should dynamically replan to best accomplish the mission. The domain of inflight rerouting and mission replanning concepts for these dynamic environments are presented.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate regenerable plant supports from inedible plant fiber for use in Advanced Life Support (ALS) System plant growing units. Plant supports of interest include seed plugs, seeding mats, root/shoot barriers, and plant fences. The innovation is to develop totally regenerable plant structures that retain sufficient structural integrity for plant support over one crop cycle, that can be fabricated on-site, are non-toxic to plants, and which do not require separation from the inedible plant waste stream. By forming expendable components from inedible plant material already in the ALS system, resupply mass can be significantly reduced (an annual supply of non-regenerable seed plugs is about 124 to 3000 kg depending on the type). Harvesting procedures would be simplified since support structures would be processed directly as part of the inedible waste stream. The use of regenerable seed plugs would also reduce crew time, and simplify the mechanization of seeding and harvesting processes. Proposal tasks involve processing plant fibers, fabrication of prototypes, and mechanical and biocompatibility testing of the prototype regenerable seed plugs. The anticipated result of this project is a process and associated technology to produce regenerable plant supports meeting ALS operational requirements.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         ORBITEC proposes to conduct innovative research and development that would culminate in an Aerodynamic Fluid Physics Research Facility (AFPRF) technology demonstration on the International Space Station serving one or more critical experimental needs of the NASA mg Program. The AFPRF would serve as an innovative microgravity apparatus that would virtually eliminate g-jitter and provide a gently controlled acceleration environment. The innovation is based on: the use of a new type of gas-flow generator, an expert system software architecture concept, a non-contact approach for on-orbit position control of spherical liquid samples, and a non-contact fluid motion exciter. Prescribed acceleration levels can be accurately introduced through controlled pulses/oscillations or spin/rotation/vibration of the large and small floating fluid samples. We propose to develop a prototype flight unit to be tested on a reduced-gravity parabolic aircraft in Phase I. In Phase II, we will develop a space-qualifiable AFPRF system that can be used on the International Space Station to satisfy current and future fluid physics flight experiments. The AFPRF would become a powerful research tool with a very low-g, vibrationally isolated, float zone capability combined with a controllable acceleration and disturbance levels that would enhance future fluid physics experiments.",

In order to match an individual who has a disability        with the appropriate assistive technology, it is necessary that all individuals      involved have knowledge and skills related to characteristics and operation of       the technology. This program will allow the user to obtain information and           training on: 1) defining features and technical characteristics of a selection       of categories of assistive technology; 2) basic principles of operation of           these devices and systems; 3) technical requirements and compatibility               information needed to interface/integrate the devices and systems; and, 4)           potential applications and typical uses of these devices and systems. The            program will use a metaphor of a community-based Assistive Technology (AT)           Center. Within the AT Center will be four rooms each dedicated to a specific         area of assistive technology: Adaptive Computer Technology Room, Communication       Technology Room, Environmental Adaptations Room, and Mobility and Seating Room.      Within each room, the user will be presented with a selection of 3D images           depicting a representative set of assistive technology devices and systems.          Interactive multimedia will provide an opportunity to learn about this               assistive technology, using a unique set of presentation technologies which          will enhance the learning experience through: interactive user control of the        program content and sequence of presentation; viewing high-resolution                photographic images and 3D objects; viewing 3D animations of device                  configuration and functioning; user manipulation and three-dimensional viewing       of both modeled representations and photographs of real devices using QuickTime      VR technology (Apple Computer); digital video presentation of device                 configuration and potential uses; access to the Internet for more information        about specific products and program updates; summaries of information that can       be sent to a printer; user-controlled, operational simulations of a selection        of assistive devices and systems; and embedded competency assessment. The            program will provide a low-cost, convenient and effective alternative for the        many individuals who need information and training on the operation and uses of      assistive technology devices and systems but do not have access to the required      assistive technology expertise or equipment.                                             PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The commercial potential for this program is indicated by: (1) large numbers of individuals with disabilities; (2) many organizations and agencies who are mandated to provide assistive technology services; 3) many university training programs in special  education, allied health sciences, engineering, rehabilitation counseling, medicine and nursing; (4) the growing need for inservice training and information; (5) many facilities such as assistive technology centers, libraries, and public computer access laboratories. This list, and the demographic information given below, indicates that there exists a large professional, institutional and organizational market for this product.",

The proposed project will develop an             interactive CD-ROM program designed to sharpen the skills of professional            caregivers who work with these residents. An on-screen needs assessment with         video modeling vignettes will evaluate user responses and recommend needed           training content. Skill-based modules, designed to accommodate users with            limited reading ability, will consist of self-paced interactive tutorials built      around realistic video modeling vignettes. The competency-based instructional        design will allow users to advance at their own pace when the material is            understood. Program modules will address 1) a problem-solving approach for           specific problem behaviors (e.g., inappropriate use of profanity, sexual, and        racist language, aggressive or apathetic behaviors), 2) specific communication       and management techniques (e.g., redirection, reminder cards), 3) techniques         for caregiver self-care, and 4) general information on dementia-care and             related issues.

Content elements will be tailored to each                   parent-user's marital status (singles/couples) and gender. The program will          further tailor the material based on the results of a parenting competency           assessment, and on child problem-behaviors of most relevance to the user. A          competency-based instructional design will include video-based quizzes,              advancing users when the material is understood, and providing review of             elements that have not been mastered. Program modules will address: 1)               monitoring, 2) making effective rules, 3) effective use of incentives 4)             developing and delivering effective consequences 5) dealing with resistance and      6) problem solving. Summary printouts of program content for users and               documentation of training progress will be supplied.                                                                                                                      The Phase I prototype was an award-winning CD that produced significant changes      in parent attitude, self-efficacy, and intention to use recommended techniques.      In Phase II, the program's content will be expanded, and it will be evaluated        with a randomized trial.        PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: This interactive multimedia (IMM) program will provide behavioral skills training for  parents of at-risk youth. It will be attractive in community and worksite settings where successful parenting and child behavior problems are relevant issues. Benefits of  the IMM format include: proven effectiveness, low-cost; individualized, self-paced  mastery learning, easy scheduling for busy parents, and objective tracking of parents'  progress.",

However, despite the improved success in stopping smoking associated with using such products, many people either do not use them or do not use them properly.  The primary aims of this project are to develop and test a tailored multimedia intervention designed to improve smoking cessation success by:  a) motivating cigarette smokers to use pharmacological aids such as NR products and Zyban, b) assisting them in choosing the type of pharmacological aid best suited to them, and c) ensuring that they employ optimal technique for the use of the chosen pharmacological aid.  In Phase I, a complete NR/Zyban intervention segment tailored for the older, Caucasian, female subpopulation was produced for use with our previously developed interactive multimedia smoking cessation programs.  The efficacy of the segment was demonstrated in a randomized-control trial.  In Phase II, we will develop pharmacological intervention materials explicitly tailored to the characteristics and needs of eleven other sub-populations (using three dimensions:  age, race/ethnicity, and gender).  The pharmacological intervention materials developed in Phase II will be disseminated in both kiosk and Internet/intranet formats.",

Young people with LD are           frequently ill-prepared to make good decisions about sexual activity,                pregnancy, and parenthood. Despite this inadequate preparation, many                 adolescents and young adults with LD look forward to sexually intimate               relationships, marriage, and parenthood. This project will develop six               stand-alone gender-specific CD-ROM pregnancy prevention programs for youth and       young adults with learning disabilities at the middle school (11-14 years),          high school (15-21 years), and adult (2 1-35 years) age levels who fall into         three categories of intellectual functioning. Within each program, negotiating,      decision-making, and conflict resolution skills will be taught using an              interactive text-free program incorporating graphics, animation, and video           components. Direct Instruction (DI) methodology will be employed to facilitate       mastery of program content for all program users. The program will be evaluated      by 350 individuals with learning disabilities in a randomized clinical trial.

Factors impacting this include rising lumber costs, the unavailability of skilled labor, limited access and the need for improved building technologies. The Interlocking Construction System (ICS) offers an innovative approach to improving rural housing. The ICS is a panelized construction system using standard interchangeable panels, whose design integrates panel and wood connections. ICS panels contain the structural framework that is formed when the panels interlock into a completely finished structure. The ICS panels can be easily transported, handled and quickly installed by a few unskilled laborers using only a few hand tools. Phase I research has proven the full-scale feasibility of the Interlocking Construction System. Initial testing of the ICS wall panels in Phase I indicates a significant ease of construction and an increase in strength over conventional building methods. Phase II research will include field-testing a full-scale test home and additional tests on the three-dimensional structure to determine how the full-scale components interact with and relate to the overall structural performance of the ICS test-home. Phase II testing should be useful in obtaining building code approval and quicker entrance into the housing market",

EachDADS sensor node uses a matched-field tracking algorithm toprovide target detections consisting of position, velocity, andclassification information.  Once a field-level detection isconstructed from the field of sensor nodes, it is transferred toa DADS master node, where field-level data fusion is performed.Each autonomous node relies on battery power to be operational.Power is drained from the battery for acoustic processing,acoustic communications, and sensor operation.  ORINCON proposesresearch and development of a field-level controller (FLC) thatwill be used by the DADS field to minimize battery powerconsumption while holding the field-level probability ofdetection (Pd) constant.  In conjunction with the FLC, ORINCONproposes research and development of a field lay-down algorithm.The field lay-down algorithm will determine the number andlocation of sensors in the field to achieve a desired level ofperformance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A surveillance system needs to accurately locate and identify not only single targets, but also groups of targets engaged in a common activity. Existing tracking systems are capable of tracking individual targets quite accurately; however, they fail to useinformation related to group behavior in order to improve these estimates. As part of our Phase I work, ORINCON developedAlgorithms those are able to exploit group motion information in order to improve the estimate of the individual targets that are contained within the group. During Phase II, we propose to extend our group tracking capabilities to handle scenarios that arerepresentative of wide-area surveillance. Key to these scenarios is the large number of targets (100-1000) and the relatively slow revisit rates (45-60 seconds). These characteristics are in contrast to precision engagement scenarios that consider tens oftargets with revisit rates of 1-5 seconds. Also, as part of our proposed Phase II work, we will develop a robust tracking system simultaneously in surveillance and precision mode. Furthermore, we propose to integrate this tracking system into an automaticcontext alert system to provide input to military operators of groups and individual targets that are of high priority to the warfighter. We propose to demonstrate this notional system concept using government-provided data from data collections oroperational scenarios.c",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Proposed innovation: Non-invasive, ultra-high resolution instrumentation is needed to monitor crystals grown in microgravity furnaces by Physical Vapor Transport (PVT). We propose an optical Superresolution Crystal Monitor (SCM) capable of reconstructing subwavelength object features that classical imaging systems cannot detect.Project objectives: The central goal is to show that well-known superresolution methods can be used to monitor samples in microgravity furnaces. These methods are established for use in telescopes, spectrometers, microscopes, and other optical instruments.Effort proposed: 1) breadboard a Phase I SCM that can be configured in multiple test geometries; 2) implement several prototype SCM systems and test their performance on model PVT crystals; 3) establish and document the best-performing system(s); and 4) verify that critical SCM components can be flight-qualified.Results anticipated: Phase I determines SCM feasibility by establishing that a flight system can achieve the ultra-high resolution needed to successful monitor PVT crystals during growth. Phase II centers on the design, development, construction, and delivery of a near flight-qualified SCM.Expected NASA applications: Compound semiconductors grown by PVT processes have critical features as small as several nm. The SCM supports understanding sample health and status for these and other interesting materials grown in microgravity furnaces.",

The goal is to perfect an analyzer that within hours can determine whetherpotable water samples contain more than one E. coli organism per 100ml.  The basis for the analyzer is an innovative oxygen sensor technology that sensitively measures respiratory activity of microorganisms.The research focus is to incorporate the sensor into microbial-filter membranes that will enable waterborne bacteria to be isolated from relatively large volume water samples by filtration. The captured organisms will be cultured briefly in selective-mediato enable proper identification of the target bacteria.  The subsequent sensor measures of oxygen consumption will semi-quantitatively resolve the number of microbes that were found in the water.The research efforts include: development of the novel sensor-filter element capable of filtering a large sample of water; development of special assay-vessels for the culture and simultaneous monitoring of the sensor; and instrumentation for conductingthe incubation and reading of the sensor-filter's signal output.  It is anticipated that the sensor system will detect the presence and measure metabolic activity of 10-20 organisms within one to two hours.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The emergence of antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has created an urgent need for new therapeutic approaches to treat the variety of diseases caused by this common pathogen. S. aureus damages host tissues by the secretion of a variety of toxic exomolecules known as virulence factors. The expression of these factors is controlled by an autocrine regulatory system whereby bacteria secrete autoinducing pheromone peptides that act on the cell to upregulate expression of the set of genes encoding virulence factors. This proposal is based on the serendipitous discovery of a modified peptide contaminating a batch of synthetic pheromone peptide based on the sequence of a non- pathogenic strain of Staphylococcus. This peptide, called virulence inhibitory factor (VIF), inhibited synthesis of alpha toxin and toxic shock syndrome toxin in all Staphylococcal strains tested. Further studies revealed that small molecule analogs of VIF inhibited virulence factor production in vitro and protected mice from a lethal systemic S. aureus infection. The goal of this proposal is to evaluate a large panel of small VIF analogs in vitro and select the best drug candidate for further studies in vivo. Proposed studies include pharmacology, toxicology, and various animal models of S. aureus infection in preparation of an IND. This novel therapeutic approach has promise in the treatment of antibiotic-resistant Staphylococci.   PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Due to the emergence of drug-resistant strains of Staphylococci, many infections are not treatable with conventional antibiotics. The pathogenesis of Staph. infections depend on the production of virulence factors that promote bacterial colonization and are toxic to the host tissues. The present application proposes to develop a novel drug that inhibits production of virulence factors and should be therapeutic to antibiotic resistant Staph.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The common cold is generally not life threatening to most people, but does cause significant morbidity and loss of productivity. For some, particularly those with asthma or who are immunocompromised, it can be quite serious. Prospects are in hand for development of a new therapeutic that could have a major impact on the spread and pathogenesis of cold viruses, in particular human rhinorivus (HRV). The objective of this proposal is to develop an ICAM1/IgA fusion protein produced in plants into an effective therapy and preventive agent against HRV. The extracellular domains of human ICAM-1, a protein found on the surface of many cell types, is used by HRV as a receptor. Genetic fusion of these ICAM-1 domains to the constant region of human IgA2m(2) creates a protein that is very effective at blocking HRV infection of cells. This protein has now been expressed in plants, where it can be produced very economically. Plants producing high levels of ICAM-1/IgA2 will be propagated, and efficient methods will be developed for purification of clinical-grade protein. The protein will be characterized in vitro, then tested in animals for safety and finally in human volunteers for effectiveness in preventing infection by HRV or development of cold symptoms. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The goal of this project is to develop a practical and affordable way of preventing infection by human rhinovirus, or drastically reducing its symptoms. Transgenic plants offer the only practical way to produce a therapeutic protein on the scale needed to treat the common cold. An effective product will have significant commercial potential.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         One hurdle to improving the efficiency of commercial aquaculture is the lack of methods for reliably counting and sizing the stock. Conventional hydroacoustical methods exist for determining fish populations in natural waters, but these methods have not been successfully adapted to commercial fish farming, where population densities are orders of magnitude higher and where wall and boundary effects on the acoustics are significant. A new technique was proposed in Phase I that relied on changes in the low frequency modes of the waveguide formed by ponds/tanks. The results of the Phase I feasibility study show an extremely high correlation between the fish density and the shift in the cut-off frequency of the enclosure with fish indicating the validity of the method proposed. The size distribution of the fish may be estimated using the resonance frequency of the fishes swim bladders. The results clearly indicate a method that may result in a viable system to detect fish biomass economically in cultured tanks, ponds, and net pens. The proposed research combines a team of experts in a focused effort to develop a robust pre-production device. The conceptual design of the system developed in Phase I will be translated and implemented into five preproduction units in Phase II and then field tested at several commercial farms.",

The system will be called SOFTRAK.  The system will developroutes considering a number of parameters unique to military operations. These parameters include enemy capabilities and presence, concealment, militarily significant terrain, mission, own capabilities and energy expenditure of SOF personnel.  The systemwill be compatible with C4I devices currently in use in the SOF community. It will be hosted on a laptop computer to support planning and analysis. It will also be hosted on a Palmtop computer to support real-time planning and route execution by SOF teamsin an operational or field environment.  We anticipate that this effort will provide a tool for SOF personnel that will increase their mission success rate, by allowing them to optimize the routes SOF teams use.  We also anticipate that the system willincrease SOF team  survivability by allowing these teams to quickly generate safe routes, when they encounter unanticipated and dangerous situations, during actual operations.",

Unlike existing  software tools that cover one or two aspects of intelligent systems design  and implementation, OpenSim & OpenAnimiation toolboxes provide a unified  environment for design and rendering of intelligent systems with features  that allow seamless transition from non real-time simulation to real-time  simulation and subsequent hardware testing using industry standard  mechatronics hardware. In Phase II we will develop detailed software that  incorporate the innovations described above leading the commercial OpenSim  and OpenAnimation toolboxes.",

Current technology for imaging these features relies on theuse of electromagnetic radiation and suffers from limited spatial resolution and limited penetration depth in areas of high soil conductivity. During Phase I we demonstrated the feasibility of using acoustic energy for this application by imaging agranite block buried in clay. In Phase II we will develop the hardware and software components required for a field-deployable imaging system. Once completed, the system will be used to conduct field surveys at several sites of interest to the Army. Wewill also attempt to use the technology developed under this program as a base for commercial products serving the environmental remediation and construction markets.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant): Recent technological developments and           increased public awareness of the need for routine mammographic screening have       resulted in a dramatic increase in the detection of small, often nonpalpable         breast lesions. Unfortunately, the pace of development of surgical tools has         not kept pace with development of the diagnostic tools and removal of these          small lesions remains a difficult, time consuming process that is prone to           failure.                                                                                                                                                                  This proposal addresses continued development of a system to allow surgeons to       accurately identify the position of tumor margins during breast conservation         surgery and needle-localization breast biopsy procedures. In Phase I, a              prototype version of the system was constructed and successfully tested on           simulated breast lesions. This testing demonstrated that the system has the          potential to increase the accuracy of these procedures and reduce the number of      surgeries that fail due to incomplete resections or missed lesions. In Phase         II, a handheld version of the system will be developed and tested on a variety       of tumor geometries representative of those encountered in clinical practice.        PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The commercial potential of this technology is significant.  Creare has formed a commercial  partnership intended to bring this technology to market.",

The cryocooler uses an innovative thermodynamic cycle to achieve very high efficiency and an innovative, diaphragm compressor for ultra-high reliability. In Phase I we will prove the feasibility of this cryocooler by (1) demonstrating operation of critical components, (2) optimizing the thermodynamic cycle, and (3) producing a conceptual design and calculating the expected performance of the cryocooler.

For space-borne cryocoolers for sensor cooling, these recuperators must also be compact, lightweight, and cause minimal pressure losses in the gas stream. To meet these challenging requirements, we propose to develop a radial flow heat exchanger (RFHX) fabricated from advanced materials. These advanced materials must have an optimal combination of thermal conductivity, strength, and formability to create a highly efficient RFHX recuperator. During Phase I, we will prove the feasibility of an ultra-high efficiency recuperator by (1) demonstrating key steps in the fabrication process using advanced materials, (2) producing a conceptual design of the RFHX, and (3) performing cryocooler system trade studies that demonstrate the performance benefits of advanced materials.",

Manned spacecraft typically use water-based, secondary coolant loops to isolate the crew from toxic or asphyxiating fluids (such as ammonia or freon) in the central thermal bus. The innovation is a fabrication approach that uses Creare's precision stamping and core bonding technologies to create a heat exchanger that isolates the fluids while achieving excellent thermal performance. The proposed heat exchanger meets the subtopic requirements by minimizing the size and mass needed for thermal control on manned space missions with a fail-safe, efficient, lightweight, and reliable heat exchanger that can be used for manned spacecraft and planetary bases. The overall objective is to fabricate, test, and deliver a prototype heat exchanger to NASA for qualification testing. The objectives of Phase I are to prove feasibility by fabricating and testing a small-scale, model heat exchanger core.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Magnetic resonance histology to image the brains of small animals       is a critical technology for biology, toxicology, and drug discovery research.       To achieve high-resolution, the radio frequency (RF) probes used to obtain the       images must have a very high signal-to-noise ratio. We propose an innovative RF      probe fabricated from high-temperature superconducting material. The probe           achieves high signal-to-noise ratio through the use of superconducting coil          elements. The novel cryogenic design enables precise control of the coil's           temperature. The probe design provides a solenoid coil surrounding the sample        for excellent coupling to the primary magnetic field, cryogenic cooling              distributed uniformly throughout the coil, and superinsulation that enables the      coil to be located very close to the sample. The probe design can accommodate        samples up to 2 cm in diameter, enabling MR histology of both mouse and rat          brains. In Phase I, we will prove the feasibility of the superconducting RF          coil by: (1) fabricating a prototypical coil element, and (2) demonstrating the      element's performance under prototypical, cryogenic conditions.   PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The key application for the RF probe is MR histology of small animal specimens. MR histology  (MRH) promises enormous benefits because it is extremely fast, allows use of unique   \"proton stains,\" produces three-dimensional images of tissues, and produces digital images  that are easily shared.  MRH has enormous screening potential because tissues can be  excised and scanned immediately.  As a result, the RF probe developed in this program  will enable tremendous cost savings in the fields of drug discovery, toxicology, and the  study of fundamental physiology and disease mechanisms.  Customers for the probe will  include pharmaceutical companies, research laboratories, and MR pathology service  providers.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Future DoD cryogenic cooling applications include space missions with relatively large cooling demands.  These include space-based lasers, orbital transfer vehicles requiring cooling of stored fuels, and space-based platforms using large arrays of infrareddetectors.  Loads for these applications will range from several watts to tens of watts.  Temperatures of interest are between 10 and 100 K.  Current reverse turbo-Brayton cryocoolers are optimized for a limited range of loads and temperatures,significantly below those of future high-capacity applications.  In order to meet future needs for high-capacity cooling, additional research and development must be performed on the turboalternator, a key component in the system.  This proposal addressesthe development of a high-capacity turboalternator.  In Phase I, key turboalternator performance parameters and loss mechanisms were quantified.  During Phase II, we propose to develop and test an advanced turboalternator optimized for a particularhigh-capacity, low-temperature application.  The turboalternator will be installed in an existing Engineering Design Model cryocooler and the performance of the cryocooler will be quantified over a wide range of temperatures.  The cryocooler test resultswill be used to set a baseline for scaling the system to other applications and to identify design features that require modification for other loads and temperatures.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         60578        Variation in system dynamics and modeling uncertainty (due to unmodeled system behavior and/or presence of disturbances), have posed significant challenges to the effective luminosity and orbit control in accelerators used in nuclear physics research.  Adaptive control has long been pursued as a possible solution, but difficulties with online model identification, and robust implementation of the adaptive control algorithms has prevented their widespread application.  In addition, the performance of the control system is contingent on the responsiveness of the control algorithm to the inevitable deviations of the model from the actual system.  This project will use neural networks to detect significant changes in system behavior and develop the methodology for online identification of new empirical models.  Furthermore, an optimal model-predictive-based adaptive control algorithm will be developed, which enables the robust implementation of an effective control strategy.  In Phase I, simulations were conducted to clearly demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of implementing model predictive control technology in accelerator control problems.  In addition, a prototype for the optimal model-predictive-based adaptive control algorithm was developed for a well-known nonlinear temperature control problem for gas-phase reactors.  In Phase II, a classification algorithm for dynamic data will be developed to enable the detection of significant changes in system behavior.  Algorithms for efficient handling of variable dynamics in the nonlinear model predictive control system will be developed, and the machinery that allows the implementation of the optimal adaptive schemes will be put in place.  Prototypes to implement the above-mentioned features in commercially available software will be developed.               Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The online system identification and optimal model-predictive-based adaptive control software should have applicability in process industries, power systems, and financial systems.  In particular, the day-to-day operation of accelerators should immediately benefit from the findings in this project.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is aimed at achieving the first ever 350W (cw) output power in a high brightness and diffraction-limited laser beam from a multicore phase-locked fiber laser array. Under Phase I, the feasibility of the unique power combining concept has been demonstrated by phase-locking a group of 7 Yb-doped single mode fiber lasers, embedded in a common cladding. In addition, a theoretical model has been developed, providing a deeper understanding of physical mechanisms responsible for phase-locking of a multicore fiber laser array. These results clearly indicate that this extremely challenging goal for Phase II can be accomplished. Nevertheless, there remain several obstacles that need to be removed before embarking on commercialization. First, a significant improvement of the laser performance must be made. This can be accomplished by exploring various parameters, which include fiber length, cavity finesse, gain saturation, temperature and stress distributions, as well as fiber structural parameters, such as core separation and the V-value. In addition, an order of magnitude improvement for efficient coupling of pump power into the clad must be made. To advance this technology, various pumping techniques will be explored, in particular the side-pumping of the fiber laser from the cladding walls, instead of the fiber end facets. If successfully developed, this could be the most viable way to obtain the maximum output power without causing catastrophic damage. Finally, the reliability of the device when operating at very high power level must be established by raising the power damaging threshold.  High power diode-pumped multicore fiber lasers can be very competitive in the market place as compared to high power diode-pumped solid-state lasers and C02 lasers presently employed by automotive, aerospace and ship-building industries for precision drilling, high-speed cutting and welding of metals and composition materials.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The double-clad multicore fiber laser has proven to be the most efficient, optically-pumped laser.  In Phase I, we have demonstated that phase-locking occurs spontaneously among a group of closely packed single mode fiber lasers configured isometrically ina common cladding.  This result suggests that, by using our unique power combining technique developed at PC Photonics Corporation, high power output exceeding 1KW in a high-brightness beam is possible and could potentially reach the 10KW range.  ThisPhase II proposal presents a detailed description of the 1KW class laser structure consisting of two isometric rings.  The design considerations include the total number of single-mode Yb-doped cores, core index, core spacing, clad dimension, fiber length,pumping configuration, gain distribution, cavity finesse and spectral width of in-fiber Bragg gratings.  Although the feasibility of this coherent power-combining concept has been demonstrated, there remain several critical technologies that need to bedeveloped for operating fiber lasers at high power level.  Specifically, crucial issues are related to (1) the modal discrimination of various supermodes naturally existing in a phase-locked laser system,(2)power damage threshold of rare-earth doped glass,(3) optical pumping at KW levels without causing catastrophic failure, and (4) thermal fracture and non-linear effects.  This Phase II proposal presents our technical approaches to resolve these critical issues, and provides a detailed description of ourwork plan, which contains 11 tasks designed specifically for achieving the objectives of this SBIR.  The goal is to estaablish a reliable power-scaling model, which will allow us to generate 1KW high-brightness laser beam from phase-locked fiber laserswithout causing power damage to the cores.  A prototype will then be built and functionally tested.",

The mechanical performance of the keelswill be determined from coupon and sub element testing.

As a result of discussions with various military customers, this project has been adapted to incorporate anti-jam (andanti-interference) capabilities into the design. Peregrine's design will enable adaptive operation with up to an 82 dB J/S jammer ratio, based on >+30 dBm linearity in the UTSi transistors and integration of 2, 5 and 8 bit A/D converters. The vulnerabilityof GPS to jamming and unintentional interference has become a major concern for both the military and commercial aviation safety.  The key deliverable results include novel system architecture, variable bit-width A/D conversion, integrated VCO function,integrated non-volatile memory and a high level of integration of various passive devices. The program will deliver initial measurements of building block circuits fabricated in UTSi upon which the designs will be based.

During Phase I, a prototype       program was developed that determined an appropriate nasal spray dosing              schedule based on a one week baseline smoking record, prompts stable dosing for      two weeks upon cessation of smoking, and then gradually reduced nasal spray use      until nicotine cessation was achieved. The program was then compared to ad lib       dosing of nasal spray in a randomized trial of 100 smokers, which provided           support for the feasibility of this product. During Phase II, we will modify         the prototype LS-NS based on the results of the Phase I results and conduct a        randomly controlled trial of 425 smokers with one year follow-up comparing           computerized scheduled dosing to ad lib dosing on nicotine nasal spray.              Subjects will be evaluated at baseline, a 10 week post-test, and at six and          12-month follow-ups. Primary outcome variables will be smoking abstinence,           latency to relapse, the number of nasal spray doses administered during the          initial weeks of treatment, and the percent nicotine abstinent at                    post-treatment.

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): The overall goal of this project is to       continue development and evaluation of a self-help behavioral smoking reduction      program for chronic smokers. The program, LifeSign for Smoking Reduction             (LS-SR), is targeted to chronic smokers who are unwilling to quit smoking, and       for whom a reduction in smoking is a reasonable short-term goal. In Phase I, we      developed a prototype of the LS-SR program that used scheduled gradual               reduction principles to reduce smoking by 50 percent and maintain these              reductions, successfully recruited 99 smokers appropriate for a smoking              reduction intervention, and assessed the feasibility of this prototype in a          randomized controlled trial comparing LS-SR to a manually-guided research            trial. The LS-SR condition produced greater, frequently significantly greater        reductions, in various measures of smoking behavior, dependence, and nicotine        exposure. For Phase II, we propose to modify the LS-SR program based on the          Phase I results and compare this programs to a manually-based smoking reduction      condition in 375 smokers who are not amenable to quitting smoking. Subjects          will be randomly assigned to one of these self-help interventions and will be        assessed at pre-intervention, at post-intervention 7 weeks later and at 14 and       28 weeks post-interventions. The primary outcome measure for the study will be       7 day reconstruction of daily smoking rate corroborated by CO and saliva             cotinine assessment. CO and measures of short-term changes in health status          (e.g. BP, and exertion, health status questionnaire.) Physical fitness will be       measured at all assessment points. To determine the effect of smoking reduction      on subsequent quit attempts, reported quit attempts, methods of quitting, and        periods of abstinence (biochemically validated) as well as self-efficacy to          quit and Stages of Change will be assessed at all visits. Additionally,              measures of smoking typography will be obtained to measure directly the degree       of compensatory smoking resulting from reduced smoking.

        "abstract": "Abstract         60795     Positron emission tomography (PET) is a non-invasive functional imaging technique that measures biochemical/physiological parameters using radiopharmaceuticals labeled with positron-emitting radioisotopes within the human body.  The development of a reliable, high yield, and economical method for the cyclotron-produced radioisotope fluorine-18 in the form of [18F] fluoride ion would be beneficial for the growth and increased utilization of PET.  This project will develop a practical and reliable method for the use of gaseous [18O] oxygen gas as the target material for aqueous [18F] fluoride ion production.  This target offers two important advantages over the current liquid target method: (1) gas targets are able to withstand relatively higher beam currents than liquid targets giving higher yields, and (2) the expensive enriched oxygen-18 gas target material can be more efficiently recovered after the bombardment and received for subsequent runs.  In Phase I, a prototype [18O]oxygen gas target was designed, constructed, and tested with a manually-operated target support unit (TSU) and was shown to produce aqueous [18F] fluoride ion in good yield.  The TSU allows the cryogenic recovery and recycling of the enriched [18O]oxygen gas.  The problem of combining elements of both a high-pressure gas target for the bombardment and a liquid target for the product delivery was solved.  Phase II will design and construct a fully functional prototype high-current target and TSU that will be used for automated operations on the current generation of biomedical cyclotrons.                       Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: New commercial suppliers and distributors of PET radiopharmaceuticals are being announced regularly as are new medical imaging devices that require these positron-emitter labeled radiotracers.  The new target should result in a reliable, high-yield, economical method becoming the new standard method for the production of fluorine-18 radiopharmaceuticals for PET in clinical and research studies",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This project proposes the development of a robust, low cost, high density, hybrid power system. The most important features of the proposed approach are: 1) The implementation of the best commercially available power production components with emphasis onsimplicity, robustness, and low cost. The baseload and intermediate power (15 W to 50 W) will be provided by a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) commercially available from H-power and the peak power will be provided by a proven, high performanceNickel-Metal-Hydride battery available from Energizer. In phase I bottled hydrogen will be used to fuel a brass board demonstrator and in phase II one of two candidate hydrogen storage technologies will be integrated. 2) A robust and simple overallconfiguration which places the fuel cell and battery directly in parallel. Careful selection of cell counts in both the fuel cell and battery will lead to a system that does not draw from the battery until the power level reaches ~ 50 W but still providesenough overvoltage at baseload power (15 W) to trickle charge the battery. This simple approach is made practical by the implementation of a battery management strategy based on slight variations in fuel cell air stoichiometry (i.e. slight changes in airsupply). 3) An efficient, robust, and low cost control strategy that employs the SmartGuardTM battery management technology developed at AeroVironment. The SmartGuard is a commercially available battery management system that can be slightly adapted toprovide the control requirements of this system. SmartGuardTM will cost only $50 per unit.",

Rechargeable batteries represent a large and growing segement of this market.  The governing component of the emerging Li-polymer battery the solid polymerelectrolyte (SPE) and its current composition is not acceptable.  New materials are needed to overcome the weakness of the current SPE.  The proposed effort seeks to bring the Li-polymer battery into the commercial marketplace by perfecting new polymersfor Li-polymer SPEs that were identified in the Phase I effort. These new polymers will offer dramatically improved ionic conductivity and cation transport.  The Phase II effort will utilize computer aided molecular dynamics (MD) simualtions to refine thestructures of the new polymers and seek wasy to further imroving their performance.  These MD studies will form the basis for deciding which materials to synthesize.  SPEs will be formulated using these new polymers and characterized using standardelectroanalytical techniques.  The better SPEs that emerge from these  characterization studies will then be incorporated inot batteries for extensive battery testing to determine how these batteries compare with standard Li-ion batteries.  The outcomewill be an SPE for use with a variety of lithium chemistries.  Successful development of the proposed SPE will lead to its commercialization as the SPE for Li-polymer batteries.  It is expected that the Li-polymer battery will grow in popularity at thesame pace as its liquid electrolyte Li-ion battery.  This would mena that htese two battery systems will lead the hyge battery market and will eventually come to dominate the entire market.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION: The distinctive arginine requirement of hepatocellular carcinomas       and malignant melanomas provides the basis for a new potential chemotherapy.         Just as acute lymphocytic leukemia cells require asparagine and E. coli              asparaginase enzyme can be used to effect a cure for this disease, we propose        using a mycoplasma derived arginine deiminase (ADI) to treat hepatocellular          carcinoma and malignant melanomas. As a result of Phase I funding we have            discovered a method where by ADI can be formulated with polyethylene glycol          (PEG) such that it has a much longer circulating half-life in mice and is less       immunogenic. When ADI formulated with PEG is injected into mice it selectively       reduces the plasma levels of arginine and starves human melanomas and                hepatocellular carcinomas implanted into these animals. This treatment is also       being tested in dogs with spontaneous melanoma (under an INAD received from the      FDA) and is quickly being proven to be an effective means of treating                spontaneous melanoma with very few, if any, side effects. We have requested and      received an Orphan Drug Designation for this project and in a Pre-IND meeting        with the FDA and the Orphan drug Office, delineated the experiments needed to        file a Phase I IND to permit human testing of this drug. The studies proposed        in this grant reflect the FDA requirements and when completed will allow for         the testing of ADI formulated with PEG in humans. The studies proposed include       the validation of the process used to make (under GMP conditions) 3 lots of          ADI-PEG, characterize these lots with validated procedures, obtain                   pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic data that will allow allometric modeling of      the predicted human dosing and perform the necessary immunological and               toxicological testing needed for this project to progress into human clinical        testing.

        "abstract": "Abstract         New regulations for drinking water treatment are leading to alternatives to chlorine disinfection. As a result, the use of ultraviolet (UV) light for disinfection is growing rapidly. The disinfection capability of commercial UV systems is limited by available mercury lamp technology. Phoenix Science & Technology's innovative Surface Discharge (SD) UV lamp is a promising candidate to both improve the effectiveness and decrease the cost of UV disinfection. Phase I demonstrated the effectiveness of SD lamps at inactivating microorganisms, using three to five times less electricity than the mercury-based UV lamps. Because electricity is the largest operational cost of disinfection, use of the SD lamp can reduce cost. The SD lamp's high intensity and UV spectrum proved more effective at deactivating microorganisms than would be expected based on efficiency alone. The advantages demonstrated in Phase I may be even more important in deactivating viruses that require very high UV doses from mercury lamps. Furthermore, unlike mercury lamps, the SD lamp has no mercury or other toxic materials with environmental disposal issues. The goal of this Phase II program is to conduct research to pursue the advantages of SD lamps for UV disinfection, develop an SD UV reactor, conduct comparative UV disinfection tests with a commercial mercury lamp UV system, and establish the practicality of commercializing SD lamp UV disinfection systems. Disinfection testing will be conducted in collaboration with researchers at Duke University and with a major manufacturer of UV disinfection equipment. This Phase II will incorporate validation testing protocols outlined in the U.S. EPA guidance document on using UV for disinfection, scheduled for release late in 2002. A successful Phase II will lead to commercialization of SD UV disinfection systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The goal of this proposal is to develop a new detector technology for digital x-ray imaging based on HgI2 polycrystalline films coupled to large area flat panel amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) thin-film transistor (TFT)-addressed readout arrays. This novel imaging detector when optimized will provide order of magnitude improvements in sensitivity to x-rays and superior spatial resolution compared to detectors utilizing scintillating phosphors coupled to a-Si:H readout arrays. The increased sensitivity of the detector will allow for a ten-fold reduction in radiation dose to a patient for an equivalent quality image. The enhancement of the spatial resolution will have a direct impact on the quality of the image, which has paramount importance in many medical diagnostic procedures such as mammography. In addition, digital capabilities will allow for convenient film-less image acquisition, retrieval, and storage. Digital image processing, computer-assisted diagnosis, and the ability to provide real time images have distinct advantages in many medical diagnostics. During Phase I of this proposal we developed techniques for highly controlled growth of polycrystalline HgI2 films in terms of their thickness, sizes of the polycrystalline grains, uniformity of layers and good electrical properties. In the Phase II effort we will finalize the HgI2 film development and construct x-ray imaging detectors using initially small commercial flat panel a-Si:H readouts (approximately 2\"x2\"). Then we will scale up the film growth equipment and construct large area (approximately 14\" x 17\") x-ray imaging detector. The film growth process will be optimized for low production cost. This new x- ray imager will be characterized and compared with current commercial detectors in terms of spatial resolution, gain, linearity, noise, uniformity, and detective quantum efficiency. The imaging capabilities will be tested in our laboratory and at UCLA School of Medicine with the use of slits and phantoms. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: There is a strong interest in application of digital radiographic detectors for medical diagnostic applications, nondestructive evaluation of materials, x-ray diffraction of biological and other material samples, and astronomical observations. Conservative estimates are that in the medical area alone there are over 600 x-ray images produced per 1000 population per year. The proposed detectors will be highly attractive to this enormous commercial market segment due to the order of magnitude performance improvements that they will offer.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         An automatic, high fidelity, wide area, multi-spectral scenegeneration capability incorporating the advanced VTRPEpropagation code is proposed for radar system applications. Theproposed physics-based approach employs material and featuretyping at the individual pixel level to produce RCS maps, whichcan be used in both monostatic and bistatic applications. Thesoon-to-be commercially available EarthScape3D, an automated geo-specific scene database generator developed jointly by PRA andEvans and Sutherland(E&S;), is proposed to be the backbone of theautomated system. The scenes are deterministic and geo-specific,enabling radar sensor simulations in real-world conditions to beconducted. The major benefit of the underlying physics-basedapproach is that the common scene databases support multiplesensors operating at different frequencies, and that reflectivitycharacteristics from the scene can be rapidly recomputed as eachsensor platform moves relative to the scene.  The proposed effortencompasses wide area scene generation, high-resolution scenemodeling, and synthetic target seeding.  Sensor/scene interfacescan provide inputs to radar sensor models with modeling in thefrequency domain (spectral representation) and in the time domain(coherent I, Q pulse generation). The scene generation softwarewill be based on a CORBA-component model (CCM) to facilitateupgrades,integration with EarthScape3D, and interoperability withvarious mission models to support U.S. Navy operational andinvestment strategies.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The sensing element is the heart of a sensor.  A generic requirement for any sensor is that it only responds to the particular stimulus since all other stimuli are considered noise.  The basic physics of the operation of a sensor thus determines the limitof its sensitivity.  Here we build upon a family of proposed light sensors in which sensor noise is substantially reduced by altering the nature of current transport.  This is done by 1) confining the electrons in a reduced dimensional regime such as aquantum well or wire, and 2) producing a contact of a different dimension to this electron cloud.  These hetero-dimensional devices substantially affect current transport.  We will fabricate and test detectors for operation in the near infrared (NIR)regime that will surpass present technology in terms of dark current, responsitivity, and speed.  We will fabricate and test Photodiodes, Photoconductors, Schottky diodes, and HEMTs on the same monolithic substrate demonstrating the feasibility of thefabrication of all the elements necessary for a photoreceiver, or an imaging array.  We then apply this design strategy to a different material system that is especially suitable for operation in 1300 and 1550 nm windows for use in long haul fiber opticcommunication networks.  As result of this work, devices that exceed present technology in terms of noise performance, sensitivity, and speed will be fabricated and tested.  Initial concentration is on 700-900nm ranged followed by work in 1300-1550nmrange.  Applications of these devices are in a variety of areas, but the most promising are the following:1. Receivers for Fast Ethernet 2. Receivers for Long Haul Communication 3. Wavelength Division Multiplexing receivers.  4. Near Infrared MedicalImaging",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A novel methodology for real-time characterization of the structural behavior of parachutes during inflation is proposed.  This method is based on using embedded fiber optic sensors for stress/strain field measurements.  A number of sensors will bearranged in a two-dimensional array of elements.  Some of these sensors will be positioned along the radial direction of the parachute canopy and others positioned in the hoop direction.  Also, a number of sensors will be connected along the parachutesuspension lines.  These sensors will be integrated into an opto-electronic monitoring system. Remote sensing technology will be used for the transmission of information from this opto-electronic system to a ground station.During the Phase I work on this project, the concept of using two types of fiber optic sensors for monitoring stresses in canopy fabrics and suspension lines have been successfully demonstrated. The integration of these two types forms a novel sensorysystem capable of measuring the dynamic structural behavior of a parachute during inflation. The phase II work plan will be directed toward the development and calibration of the required sensors and the integration of these sensors into the sensorysystem.  The tasks include the design and manufacturing of all the electronic components for signal processing, data acquisition, and remote display of the sensor output. Small-scale laboratory tests and wind tunnel tests will be performed for systemevaluation and calibration.  Finally, a normal full-scale airdrop test using a full-sized personnel parachute will be performed.  The system output measurements will be coded and transmitted to a ground station.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Building on a successful Phase 1, phase II is designed to provide a working prototype of the tag interrogator and the passive liquid tags to USSOCOM.  The Phase II effort focuses on operationalizing the technologies and techniques developed during Phase I.The ability to passively tag, monitor movement, locate and identify the specific tags has been proven in Phase I.   Photon-X team offers an innovative technique to passively tag military troops, military vehicles, military assets and or undercover clandestine operational codes, which are undetectable by the human eye or conventional sensors.  Photon-X has developed apatent pending sensor technology called spatial phase, which has demonstrated initial proof of concept for imaging, tracking multi-level transparent bar code tags.  Spatial phase technology 1) creates a transparent liquid bar code tag 2) is a portablesensor system for real-time identification of tags, 3) incorporates commercial-off-the-shelf camera technology and 4) uses easy to install bar codes.  Spatial phase can be used for automated tracking and inventory of critical military assets as well astransparent tags for clandestine operations.  Photon-X has spun-off a commercial venture (Sport-X) dedicated to developinga passive tagging, tracking and identification optical bar code system to be usedin the Sports and interactive gaming markets.  The Sport-X mission is to developnon-intrusive tags which can be easily placed on athletes and other sports gear totrack these elements for real-time analysis of the players performance, fatigue,weaknesses, etc., this can be used by coaches or by broadcasters as sports commentary.  Sport-X has estimated the sports training and player performance market to beseveral billion for each of the major sports, such as, Football, baseball, soccerand Basketball.  Computer animation is when each of these passive non-intrusivetags is placed on the joints and the motion of these tags are recorded real-timeand TCP/IP transmits the 3D coordinates back to central base station for real lifemovement of animated scenes.  The invention of new sensors continues to add newdimensions to the way humans",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A broad variety of military environments subject soldiers to severe shocks, vibrations, and rapid sharp motions on a regular basis that can contribute strongly to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and other repetitive stress injuries (RSIs).  In order tounderstand the causes of MSDs, particularly to the head and neck, it is necessary to determine the forces and stresses imposed upon the head and neck and correlate the results with the response of the major muscle groups as measured by electromyographic(EMG) activity.  Physical Optics Corporation proposes to develop a Compact Upper Extremity Tracking and EMG Recorder (CUE-TER) system, with wired and wireless capability, in which microelectromechanical system (MEMS) sensors measure the accelerations androtations of the head and torso while simultaneously sensing the EMG activity of the major muscle groups of the neck and upper back.  The resulting data is relayed from these sensors to a solid state recorder, which compresses and stores the results innon-volatile flash memory.  From the recorded data, military personnel can extract the forces, torques, and stresses on the head and neck, and the associated muscle activity.  This information can then be used to identify and ameliorate the causes of MSDs,and to design laboratory simulations.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         60237      Wireless communications sometimes require not only secure two-way communications but also mutual and continuous authentication of the identity and position of mobile units and cellular network control stations.  This is particularly important for treaty verification, for the transport of munitions, fissile material and currency, and for vehicle control and tracking within both government and commercial facilities.   This project will develop the Spatial Diversity Encryption Chaffing Interface system, which splits a secure communication into a stream of packets and distributes transmission across all cells within range of the mobile unit.  The spatial distribution of the cell sites then implicitly encodes the identity of each packet by direction of propagation, time of flight, and spatial modulation.   In Phase I, a prototype wireless cellular packet network implementing spatial diversity as an entirely novel security feature was successfully implemented, incorporating both spatially diverse transceiver hardware and complementary sequenced chaffing and winnowing software within a small wireless local area network.  Operation of larger cellular networks with multiple mobile units and a large number of cell site concentrators was verified via simulation.  In Phase II, a comprehensive system for secure communications and continuous mutual authentication of identity and position of mobile units on a cellular packet network will be developed.  Also, a comprehensive secure packet transmission protocol and interactive network management interface will be demonstrated.                  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The proposed system should bring secure authenticated communication to cellular handsets and mobile stations as well as to armored car fleets and other carriers of valuable or sensitive materials.  By constantly verifying the position and route of mobile units, the system will safeguard against hijacking, theft, ambush, and diversion while maintaining a reliable positive control link for secure transport fleets.",

During Phase I, POC will conduct two major efforts: (1) develop a scalable wavelet coder to compress the video data to reduce bandwidth and storage space, and (2) develop a quotient coding modulation for compressed data to ensure low bit-error-rate data communication. A scalable coder will compress the data and arrange them from more important to less important bits. The bit stream can be truncated at any point and still retain a perceptible reconstructed image. After the coder, the video data will be further modulated with the quotient coding to increase its bit-error-rate performance. After the completion of this Phase I project, a software-based simulation system that can perform scalable two-way video data communication will be demonstrated. In Phase II, a two-way video communication system with an efficient user interface that facilitates intensive manual activities will be built. This system can provide improved operator efficiency for tele-operating robotic systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The project goal is to develop an alternative infrasound monitoring system with piezoelectric sensors for use under the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.  These sensors will have several advantages over the microbarograph system that forms the baseline forthe IMS.  As an all-electronic system, the novel sensor would be far simpler than the baseline, with no moving parts or piping.  It will be more robust and durable, less expensive, and more flexible in its design and capabilities.  For example, electronicsignals do not experience delay so that subelements can be at any distance from processing unit.  In Phase I, it was demonstrated that off-the-shelf PVDF piezocable could be used as an infrasound sensor but conformity with the Treaty noise specificationcould not be demonstrated.  The potential reasons for this are understood.  In Phase II, a revised system meeting the specifications will be developed through a combination of lower electronic amplifier noise and higher acoustic sensitivity with highsensor capacitance.  This may require a change of sensors to a modified piezocable, series combinations of multiple cables or the use of PVDF cylinders.  A prototype, optimizing signal and noise, suitable for the IMS application will be developed anddemonstrated in a field test.  An all-electronic piezoelectric infrasound ISM array alternative would be less complex than the present design and will provide many advantages.  The simpler array would likely be less susceptible to environmental factors,lower in cost both to purchase and maintain, more reliable, easier to replace, and possibly less visible and thereby less susceptible to vandalism.  It also offers the prospect of novel electronic processing.  If individual subelements are monitored,arrays can beamformed to provide directionality.  Similarly array sections that are noisy for any reason (e.g., due to animals or other highly local phenomena) can be identified and temporarily ignored in order to maintain the signal to noise ratio for theentire array.  Beyond the CTBT applications, due to their simplicity, light weight, flexibility, and low cost, piezoelectric infrasound sensors become attractive for a number of military and civilian applications.",

The devices will be very thin, and consume power only during reflectance change. They will be deposited directly onto the thin solar sail material, typically alumiminized PET. The variable reflectance materials (VRMs) will be applied to a fraction (<20%) of the solar sail surface, on areas near corners or outer edges, so that sail attitude control torques are generated with small forces due to reflectance modulation. VRMs will only slightly increase solar sail mass, < 5% for a 5 g/m2 sail, while potentially eliminating greater mass associate with mechanical and thruster systems, and increasing reliability. In Phase I, we will design and fabricate VRMs on solar sail substrates and measure their reflectance modulation performance. We will conduct preliminary space compatibility tests, and with General Astronautics (Mr. Jerome Wright), evaluate the applicability of VRMs for solar sail spacecraft missions. In Phase II, a prototype large area sail with integrated VRMs and thin-film microelectronics will be developed for delivery to NASA. Phase III will involve flight validation of variable reflectance sails and commercial development of VRMs as thermal control films.",

Although instruments are available for automated sorting of plastics, they have not been universally adopted.  Even the most sophisticated use crude and inefficient data processing methods, which limit speed and accuracy.  This project will develop data processing methods (identification algorithms) for use with these instruments, which make spectrally resolved optical reflectance measurements.  The new algorithms will enhance the speed and accuracy of identification and provide the ability to sort between plastics with small variations in composition.  Phase I obtained a spectral database of commonly used plastic containers and determined the optimal number and location of spectral bands necessary for the identification of each type of plastic.  In a comparison with a commercial instrument, the new algorithm had an accuracy of 100% versus 83% for the commercial instrument.  Phase II work will be conducted in association with a leading manufacturer of automated sorting equipment to implement the algorithm for the identification of the five major types of plastics.  The result will be a final design for implementation of the algorithm in a commercial system.              Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The data processing methods should increase the speed and accuracy of systems that identify waste plastics prior to recycling.  Emphasis will be given to the identification of common household plastics processed in materials recovery facilities.  Improvements in sorting should reduce the cost of recycling and raise the value of recycled plastics by increasing the purity of recovered product.  Sorting of industrial plastics such as automobile parts also could benefit from the use of faster and more accurate identification.",

The better performance will be achieved through  (1) determination of a process to reduce the \"dead layer\" in the crystal  that, in existing detectors, limits the penetration of low energy X-rays  into the active semiconductor material, and (2) realization of a process  for depositing the window isolating the detector from the environment  directly on the crystal.

That detector is expected to have a collection  efficiency at Carbon Ka (277 eV) a factor of two greater than current  standard Si(Li) X-ray detectors and an energy resolution of <100 eV FWHM  at 277 eV for 100 kcps total throughput.",

The goal of this project is to remedy this situation bydeveloping the Directed Energy Weapon Analysis Tool or DEWAT code.  This novel modeling and simulation code will be capable of assessing the effects of high power microwaves (HPMs) and high energy lasers on a broad range of targets includinginfrastructure, missiles, aircraft, unmanned air vehicles, and precision guided munitions.  The extensive research in laser effects, vulnerability, and lethality modeling has already been incorporated in the preliminary DEWAT code organized in Phase I.HPM effects modeling will be emphasized in the Phase II effort with the development of an innovative sub-module consisting of the HPM weapon specification, propagation algorithms to the target, target penetration algorithms and empirically based componentdamage models.  The output of the validated DEWAT code will be linked to system target damage models (PDAM/VALUE) in order to demonstrate seamless component damage transfer.  The primary applications of DEWAT will be for DoD weapon lethality andvulnerability evaluations.  Commercial sector applications include assessment of DEW threats to national infrastructure.",

PSI's scintillator-based sensor is ideally suited to monitoring the lower energy (20 to 1000 keV) chargedparticle environment.  The PSI sensor design is compatible with the weight, volume, and power requirements of nanosatellites.  The PSI sensor design does not rely upon a magnetic sector to discriminate between particle types; rather it takes advantage ofcross-section characteristics and scintillator properties to discriminate.  We have proven the feasibility of our approach in Phase I; i.e., using thin films of materials to create particle-specific detectors, fiber-optically coupled to aposition-sensitive photomultiplier tube.  The result is a tremendous savings in weight and volume.  A compelling aspect of the PSI concept is its flexibility.  While, during Phase I, PSI optimized the sensor to detect low energy charged particles, thedesign is adaptable to different energy regimes.  By simply changing the scintillator thickness and materials, the PSI sensor is configured to other energy regimes.   To ensure that we meet the science and engineering needs of both space weather monitoringand nanosatellite requirements, we are working with experts in these fields.",

This project will develop an alkali diagnostic for use in biomass gasifiers.  The instrument will provide information to enable an on-line control system for gasification systems.   Phase I preliminary data showed that spark-induced breakdown spectroscopy (SIBS) can be applied to the in-situ measurement of Na and K in a gasifier gas stream.  Also developed were a predictive model to estimate  alkali concentrations based on fuel characteristics and a design for a high temperature probe.   Phase II will design and assemble a prototype instrument for this measurement, and three field tests will be performed.                          Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The control technology should make biomass energy generation more competitive.

In this effort PSI implemented a prototype system and successfully demonstrated the feasibility of detecting thin films of the agent simulant SF96 at thicknesses of 0.5 m(50 g/cm2).  The extinction of the laser light was found to exhibit Beer's law type attenuation in this coverage range, which is well below actionable levels.  In Phase II we propose the development of a three laser system capable of detecting nerve andvesicant chemical agent films on natural and man-made surfaces at ranges up to 1 km.  This system will be constructed for implementation on a ground-based vehicle.  Construction of the system will be followed by a series of laboratory and field tests toevaluated the effectiveness of the method under a broad range of conditions.

Most will use crystal oscillators.  Applications include guided munitions, smartand penetrating weapons.  For this program we are interested in the applications which incorporate on-board GPS receivers as part of the guidance system.  The receiver requires a frequency source whose accuracy determines the time to acquire the firstsatellite.  To meet the allowable thermally induced frequency shift this will be a TCXO - - a temperature-compensated crystal oscillator. Although the circuitry of a crystal oscillator is relatively shock inert, the conventional crystal resonators used areinherently susceptible to shock. To manufacture crystal oscillators shock-hardened up to 50,000 G there is a corresponding need for hardened resonators. PTI has been intimately involved over the past decade in the development of resonator shock-hardeningtechnology.  Each technique developed to date has certain limitations, different for each. By combining techniques and adding new novel techniques we felt that inherent failure mechanisms could be eliminated. This first phase of this program demonstratedthat we can produce a much more rugged but still economical resonator to use in a high shock TCXO.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The astronomical community recognizes the Pixon(TM) method as the highest performance image reconstruction method ever developed. In addition to tremendous performance gains relative to competing methods (factors of several in resolution, orders of magnitude in sensitivity and robust artifact rejection), the Pixon method is much faster than standard non-linear methods (orders of magnitude). By nature, the Pixon method is highly parallelizable, suggesting that hardware implementation should achieve video rates (30 Hz) for 512x512 pixel images. We propose to design such hardware, as a prelude to construction in Phase-II. Such hardware would have tremendous commercial applications (medical imaging, radar, commercial satellite and aircraft imaging, surveillance, military intelligence), and be directly relevant to the goals of NASA's Data Understanding and Adaptive Methods (SBIR 99-1, Topic 21.03) program. The Pixon method directly provides the ability to deal quantitatively with uncertainty present in data by building flexible models through which observables are linked to quantities of scientific or engineering interest. A Pixon hardware implementation would be of immediate benefit to NASA, dramatically improving the quality of NASA's imaging data. Furthermore it will provide a natural front-end processor for future robotic vision or image classification/segmentation engines.",

The Phase I work showedthat in two acoustic environments the ASA algorithm has shown anability to provide estimates of LFBL parameters that are as goodor better than those from the FA algorithm with a significantreduction in run times. Run times for the ASA algorithm comparedto the FA algorithm for the same cases were between 12 and 16times faster. While significant, this result needs to bevalidated across as broad a variety of acoustic environments aspossible in to test its tactical utility and robustness.

Versatile sample containment fabrication techniques are needed to meet the science requirements of NASA's principle investigators. New quenching requirements have caused current ceramic crucibles to crack. Traditional ampoule/cartridge assemblies lack the ability to provide sufficient quench rates due to gaps between the cartridge and the ampoule. An innovative quench crucible comprised of an internal ceramic liner in direct contact with a reinforcing metal overlay is the needed solution. With proper selection, the ceramic liner will provide the chemical compatibility for processing the PI's sample, and the reinforcement metal overlay in direct contact with the liner will enable rapid quench rates and prevent cracking. During Phase I, two novel fabrication methods will be investigated which will allow the fabrication of reliable quench crucibles. The first technique will use preformed ceramic ampoules reinforced with a deposited metal overlay. The second technique will involve the spray forming of both a ceramic liner and metal reinforcement on a removable mandrel. With the development of these two crucible fabrication methods, essentially any principle investigators' sample containment requirements can be satisfied.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The design of propulsion test stands and impact of new engines on existing test stands and surrounding environments requires the calculation of exhaust plume environments (pressure, radiative and convective heating, acoustics and environmental contamination). The current process is very labor-intensive and requires the use of a multitude of individual non-interacting models that requires several experts. Plumetech (PT) proposes to develop a PC Windows-based software package that integrates a CAD geometry module with the individual components of plume induced environments that can be used by personnel not versed in all models, to rapidly calculated the plume induced environments and determine the subsequent impact on the design, the environment and hardware in the area surrounding the stand. With NASA becoming more directly involved in test stand design and testing of propulsion systems, it is essential that NASA have the ability to provide the environments and determine the impact of the environments on test stands in a rapid, cost effective manner. The proposed Phase I study is innovative as it combines recent CAD surface geometry modeling advances with plume, plume induced environment and thermal response models that allow easy, accurate, and rapid computation/evaluation of the impact of the induced environments on test stands.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION: (Applicant's abstract) The development of enzyme biocatalysts that      are reusable and able to work in heterogeneous reaction systems is the focus of      this proposal. A reversibly soluble polymer is to be attached to the enzymes.        Consequently, the biocatalyst can be precipitated without enzyme denaturation        after product separation. Later the biocatalyst can be dissolved again in a          suspension of the starting materials at the initial conditions. Therefore,           these biocatalysts acquire the advantages of free enzymes (high activity in          heterogeneous systems) and of immobilized enzymes (the possibility of a reuse).      Biocatalysis is underutilized in industry due to the industry requirement that       the biocatalyst should be reusable and the reaction has a high throughput.           Solubility of the compounds in limited and this necessitates running the             reaction in heterogeneous suspension of the starting materials and the               products. However, today all biocatalysts on the market either cannot be reused      or do not work in heterogeneous systems. Feasibility of the idea was                 demonstrated on during Phase I. Phase II focuses on the optimization of the          process using the enzymes of industrial interests. These biocatalysts will be        marketed to pharmaceutical companies and used to manufacture chiral                  pharmaceuticals. In 2000, the market for such biocatalysts is about $200             million.                                                                             PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The enzyme biocatalysts described in proposal are unique because they combine advantages    of free and immobilized enzymes.  There are no biocatalysts of this kind commercially   available and an enormous commercial potential exists because most drugs are developed  in a single enantiomer form.  Sales of the reversibly soluble biocatalyst for a production of  just one drug can generate up to several million US dollars per year.",

Control of surface chemistry bulk composition has utility in            tissue engineering, in fabrication of conventional medial devices and in new         nanotechnology application of polymers. In Phase we confirmed that, while rates      are slower, equilibrium surface tension/composition of polymer blends is             quantitatively similar to conventional surfactants in liquid Solvents. Energy        minimization drives surface equilibration, which depends on the nature of the        interface, e.g., air vs. blood. Phase II involves preparation of three series        of polymer blends with varying surface composition, each with a different            surface modifying end group: silicone, fluorocarbon, polyethyleneoxide.                                                                                                   Each series will be characterized by several surface-sensitive methods               including Sum Frequency Generation Spectroscopy, XPS, AFM and surface                tension/wettability. Each characterized series will be subjected to a battery        of short-term in vitro biological tests including (competitive) protein              adsorption and complement activation. The hypothesis to be testes is that            biological response will vary monotonically with surface chemistry when the          surface chemistry is determined by truly surface-sensitive methods and               knowledge of the kinetics of polymer surface rearrangement following upon            immersion of air-equilibrated surfaces into aqueous fluids.

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Verbatim from Applicant's Abstract): Our goal is to construct a         prototype chamber with protocols for the manufacture of a new low-voltage            electroporation (LVEP) system to transfect suspended and adherent cells under        physiologic conditions. Electric field amplification results from embedding the      cells into the pores of thin (13 um) insulating filters, enabling all 0.33           million to be simultaneously electroporated using 5-20 V across a 2 cm gap. The      use of low voltage/current is the key to this new technique. The large increase      in current density in the pores, produced by the reduction of current shunt          pathways around each embedded cell, amplifies the localized field across the         filter 1000X. LVEP produces minimal Joule heating and electrode products as the      current is only 25 - 50 mA versus 25 - 50 A in suspension electroporation.           Further, only one side of the cell, at the end of the cell process inside the        pore, is electroporated. The transmembrane potential of the membrane hemisphere      in the pore is constant, thus, the entire area reaches the same potential. The       Phase I study demonstrated that LVEP can transfect mammalian cells with 93-98%       cell viability, with transfection efficiencies of 5-80% of embedded cells. In        Phase II, we will optimize the chamber characteristics and protocols to              transfect genes into both adherent and suspended cells to maximize transfection      efficiency, cell survival and ease of use. Different plasmids and cells will be      examined, including primary cell lines. Important goals are to transfect cell        lines proven difficult and demonstrate capability where high cell survival is        necessary.    PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Not Available",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The Montreal Protocol eliminated the manufacture of chlorofluorocarbons that cause chemical depletion of the ozone layer calling for replacement for the gaseous fire-extinguishing agents, halons. Replacement gases proved to have problems from generation of toxic byproducts to poor fire suppression capability. Powsus, Inc., developed and patented an environmentally friendly powder enhancement to these replacement gases, Envirogel, that demonstrates fire suppression levels equal to or better than the halons without the toxic byproducts. The application of this EPA SNAP approved extinguishant has been evaluated in Phase I in a novel patented distribution system that stores the agent in a tough, light-weight pressure vessel plastic tube that bursts when exposed to increased temperature and increased pressures, releasing the agent for fire suppression. Phase I provided evaluation of at least two types of plastic tubes that can be successfully utilized for inexpensive, automatic extinguishment of fires in contained areas such as engine compartments and cargo containers when designed for their specific operating conditions. This technology applies globally to high fire risk conditions of all kinds, fuel fire hazards (engines), or material storage. The fire protection industry is a controlled industry. For commercialization to occur, the application of this new technology must be demonstrated and verified in Phase II with the recognized regulatory fire agencies, UL, FM, EN3 (Europe), and USCG. The basic Phase II development effort would be to confirm the Phase I success with long-term aging of product configurations: plastics and agents for permeability, high- and low- temperature operation, accelerated aging, fire suppression minimums, fire type capability, corrosion, and any other criteria for commercial acceptance that the testing agencies desire. Because there are no existing standards for this unique product, new standards will have to be established with the approval agencies.",

The product addresses      a pivotal skill --generalized identity matching to sample -- which is a target       of many current programs for teaching this population (and also for teaching         young typically developing children). In identity matching, students are             presented with an array of two- or three-dimensional stimuli and required to         select the item that physically matches (i.e., is identical to) a sample; hence      the name \"matching to sample.\" The project has two major objectives. First,          based on a successful prototype developed in Phase I, we will develop a              full-feature version of the StartMatching! product, in anticipation of               commercialization. Second, we will verify that the product (1) can be                implemented effectively by its intended users and (2) teaches matching skills        reliably in settings in which it will be routinely used.

Our rate offalse positives and false negatives were less than 0.4% when attempting to detectthe attack using a 4-second window. The rates of false positives and false negativesdrop even lower when we increased that window to 16 seconds. Our success can beattributed to the use of probability density functions (PDFs) (versus averages,variances, etc.), the compression of PDFs, and the efficient use of innovative typeof NNs. This tool, if deployed in the Army's Tactical Internet, can remove therequirement of having high personnel expertise needed to examine the data (e.g.,System logs) to detect intrusions.

Most importantly, they do not use the full multi-net facilities that support significant densities of concurrent radio traffic in a limited spatialarea while maintaining a high AJ margin.  Futhermore, a substantial effort is required for mission planning to design a network, and real-time changes are limited.  Establishing and maintaining an operational network requires control assets that may not beon station, so it is desired to provide for an HAE UAV that supports ground control.  Establishing and managing LInk-16 networks can be dramatically improved by providing tools that take advantage of more recent hardware and software technologies.Specific areas addressed in this proposal include network planning tools for mission support, dynamic allocation of multiple net resources in real time, and increased throughput via optimized resource allocation.   Given PSI'S CAD technology, thecomplexity of similar problems solved by this technology, and experience with the multi-net management problem, this proposal provides an innovative approach to a fully automated network management support sytem for dynamic multi-net operations.

The work will be based on new damage estimation, tracking, and prognostic algorithms that have been successfully developed in Phase I.Existing algorithms have been applied to data from the Boeing Reconfigurable Control and Fault and Identification System (RCFIS), an F/A-18 stabilator hydraulic control system test rig.  Our algorithms can successfully discriminate between baselineconfigurations and those containing subtle faults, using only data readily available on aircraft: no new sensors are required.  Phase II will continue to focus on software development for diagnosis/prognosis of aircraft hydraulic system grayscale healthmonitoring and failure prediction. Also, embedded applications in the industrial equipment and sensor industries will be developed.  Additional tasks for Phase II include: defining the product in consultation with end users; enhancing the robustness andsensitivity of the damage tracking software; and better defining the data and processing requirements, and understanding how these are related to the specific task and signal environment. In addition to software products, this work will result in amethodology for evaluating the feasibility of specific applications, and for designing integrated diagnostics for embedded applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Applicant's abstract verbatim): A prototype optical testing             machine for condoms will be built and tested, first in the laboratory and later      on loan to condom manufacturers. Unlike standard electrical testing, the             machine will be able to separately identify pinhole, thin region, and embedded       particle defects. It will offer quantitative measurements (rather than simply        accept/reject decisions) and will lend itself to precisely marking the               locations of defects. The latter capability, together with the non-destructive       nature of the test itself, will be of very high value in Quality Assurance           efforts to understand the nature and causes of defects, and in defect                prevention generally.                                                                                                                                                     As was demonstrated in Phase I, the new machine will be able to test not only        latex, but also polyurethane condoms. (The two have different optical                properties.) Currently, pinhole testing of polyurethane condoms is done by a         pneumatic differential pressure technique that is cumbersome and expensive to        use. Optical testing would offer the advantage of common, convenient                 application to both latex and polyurethane products. Further, the unique             ability of the optical test techniques to detect thin regions and embedded           particles, and to localize defects, will have strong appeal to the industry.  PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The proposed system will be immediately useful in the Quality Assurance laboratories of  all manufacturers of condoms.  It will be especially appealing to manufacturers of non-  latex condoms.  It will be useful in central R & D  and product development facilities, and in  compliance labs.  Once the new techniques are accepted, it is expected that the optical  testing could be adapted to high rate screening testing in the factories.  (Typically, a   factory may have 15 to 20 such test machines in use.)",

        "abstract": "Abstract         60189         There is an important need to remotely detect and measure atmospheric concentrations of chemical agents of military and ecological concern.  Because the absorption of light by molecules is the basis for such measurements, there is a need to improve the sensitivity of differential absorption lidar (DIAL) instruments, which are used to make these atmospheric absorption measurements.   This project will significantly advance this measurement technology by employing IR detectors that can be rapidly shuttered, so that the detectors exposure to optical background is limited to the exposure time set by the returning laser pulse.  A focal plane array will be developed having a LWIR detector array and companion CMOS amplifier array that can be programmed to readout selected pixels at ~100 ns sampling intervals.   In Phase I, a readout integrated circuit (RIOC) was designed for low noise readout of a HgCdTe array of 256 detectors at 100 ns intervals.  This RIOC was laid out in CMOS, and the feasibility of building this high gain, low noise circuit on 100 micron centers was shown.   Phase II will complete the design, and the RIOC will be fabricated, evaluated, and integrated with an array of 256 detectors sensitive in the 8.5 to 11.5 micron region.  The focal plane array will be delivered to Los Alamos National Laboratory for integration and test with a multi-wavelength laser DIAL system.                     Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: In addition to DOEs national security applications, high speed imager arrays that are sensitive in the IR should have other remote sensing applications in military, environmental monitoring, and scientific research.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         60292        Edge density turbulence in magnetic fusion plasmas is important for determining the edge plasma temperature and radial width of the plasma  scrape-off layer.  Edge parameters also strongly influence the global plasma confinement and the pattern of power and particle flux to the chamber wall.  Although edge plasma turbulence has been studied for many years, the high speed dynamics of its two-dimensional structure is still highly uncertain due to a lack of appropriate diagnostics.  This project will develop new ultra-high frame imaging to make two-dimensional images of edge turbulence with a high enough framing rate to resolve the time evolution of the turbulence within one autocorrelation time (i.e. one eddy turnover time, on the order of microseconds).  In Phase I, a prototype camera with 64 x 64 pixels, operating at 100,000 frames/sec, was optically interfaced to NSTX to capture images of plasma edge turbulence.  Initial measurements indicated a need for improved shuttering and increased sensitivity, such as could be obtained using an image intensifier preceding ultra-high speed imager.  Phase II will develop an intensified camera with a 128 x 128 pixel format and 300 frame capacity and evaluate/demonstrate plasma diagnostic capabilities on NSTX and Alcator C-Mod.

        "abstract": "Abstract         A variety of effective interventions exist for people who seek help for depression. However, there is a lack of effective interventions for individuals who do not seek help or follow through with treatment referrals. We propose to fill this gap in services by developing and testing a Transtheoretical Model-based intervention that will be delivered proactively, on a population basis, to primary care patients who are experiencing symptoms of depression but are not currently involved in treatment. It is the first intervention for depression that is appropriate for individuals in all stages of change-not merely the minority who are prepared to take action. In Phase I of this Fast Track Initiative, the aims are to norm TTM measures, develop the TTM interventions, and determine the feasibility of this approach by assessing study recruitment rates and reactions to the intervention materials. Primary care patients who screen positive for mild to moderate depression and are not involved in treatment will complete surveys for measurement norming (n=100) or participate in a pilot-test of the intervention materials (n=50). If feasibility conditions are met, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial in Phase II to assess the efficacy of the expert system intervention for depression. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Depression is a costly illness for health care organizations, disability insurers, and employers because of increased health service utilization, disability claims, and lost productively among depressed individuals. An effective, low-cost expert system that can reduce the prevalence of depression on a population basis has significant commercial potential.",

Developments have been slow for reasons of fundingpriorities, previous false starts, and the gap between commercial technologies and the Defense specific needs. Several factors now allow information centric warfare to become reality. First, the developments under DARPA, Information Technology Office,Intelligent Software, Communicator research program has lead the commercial industry in areas of speech recognition and interaction providing real-world technology evaluation. Second, the US Air Force Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) with the JointBattlespace Infosphere (JBI) program reinitiated a battlefield common picture in 1998. Thirdly, Web technology has advanced so fast over the last five years that information solutions have become easier, and more affordable. To this end, the effortproposed is to research, develop and validate Web technologies to obtain a multi-model, common-authoring, universal access to the World-Wide-Web for the wireless industry and hands-free applications, that supports the DARPA Communicator and US Air ForceSAB JBI missions.",

With the forward-looking approach proposed, the technology gap is reduced to a point where a buy-integrate-test developmentcycle is realizable-agents and connectors are used to mitigate COTS product alterations.We are working with emerging technologies that have a good chance of survival through big business support.  The most germane are the multi-modal and mixed-initiative markup technologies that will enable the presentation and hierarchical informationretrieval JBI requires.  The W3C has recognized this as a valuable standard and has plans to create a working group next year.Soon the technology gap between commercial Web and the JBI information-centric requirement will close.  The Web is a paging experience with links to other pages.  Push technologies providing such things as news services have been around for a couple years.Now with broadband and XML the commercial trend will migrate the Web experience to an interactive, information-based push technology where user can build information, request notification and collaborate.  The transportation, industrial and investmentcommunities can benefit by this technology, hence will drive these standards.",

Another goal is to present these features to less programming savvy users, and at the end enable building Agent-based Web applications with little or no knowledge of underlyingsystem or technical issues involved.

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION: Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) has become        the predominant treatment for symptomatic coronary atherosclerotic lesions.          Despite its prevalent use, this technique continues to be plagued by restenosis      rate of 40% with resultant enormous added health care costs and patient              morbidity. Radiation therapy applied locally at the site of coronary balloon         injury holds great promise to reduce this restenosis rate. All current and           proposed techniques of radiation delivery carry significant drawbacks of safety      and effectiveness of uniform dose application. This project proposes a unique,       novel approach to radiation delivery through utilization of short-lived              positron emitting isotope, Cu-62, produced by a generator system. This isotope       is delivered into the angioplasty balloon and provides the required radiation        with a brief and safe inflation time. Safety issues are addressed through use        of a Cu-62 chemical form assuring blood binding in the event of balloon rupture      combined with the short 9.7 minute half-life of Cu-62. Use of a balloon              provides significant advantages of uniformity of dose delivery and with Cu-62        is completely safe. In Phase I, an automated concentration system was developed      which coupled to the Zn-62/Cu-62 generator produced the highly concentrated          solution of Cu-62. This concentrator was employed in porcine overstretch injury      model of restenosis, which demonstrated the feasibility of safe use of               generator produced Cu-62 and also achieved a substantial reduction of                neointimal hyperplasia using a delivered dose of 25 Gy.

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Verbatim from Applicant's Abstract): We propose to apply new            proprietary computational methods to assign biological functions to novel            proteins in the genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of         TB. Traditional computational methods can only assign functions to genome            sequences that are homologs of other previously characterized proteins. The new      algorithms developed by Protein Pathways scientists use other types of               information, derived from trans-genome analyses, to assign functions to              proteins that cannot be characterized by traditional computational methods. The      methods will assign probable functions to as many as 1,000 uncharacterized TB        protein sequences. Many of these proteins will be identified as having roles in      virulence and will therefore be attractive targets for future drug development       efforts.                                                                             PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The world-wide emergence of multi-drug resistant strains of many common pathogens calls  for new antibiotics.  The work proposed here will identify the functions of many previously  uncharacterized proteins in the genomes of serveral pathogens, including Staphylococcus  aureus and Enterococcus faecalis.  Those with roles related to virulence will serve as new,  previously unknown targets for therapeutic drugs.  Once experimentally validated, these  targets will be marketed to our pharmeceutical customers and partners.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative brain disorder characterized clinically by progressive loss of memory, cognition, reasoning, judgement and emotional stability that gradually leads to profound mental deterioration and ultimately death. AD is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly, today affecting 4-5 million Americans, which is expected to double in incidence in the next 25 years. AD is characterized by the brain accumulation of insoluble fibrillar amyloid deposits containing the beta-amyloid protein (Abeta), either as extracellular amyloid plaques in the brain parenchyma or in blood vessel walls. Abeta amyloid formation, deposition and persistence in brain is believed to play a central role in AD pathogenesis by contributing to neuronal loss and memory dysfunction, and therefore has become a central target for the development of new drugs for the treatment of AD and related disorders. In AD, there is currently no cure or substantially effective treatment, and the patient usually dies within 3-10 years from disease onset. Our previous studies has led to the identification of a natural substance derived from the amazon rain forest woody vine, Uncaria tomentosa (i.e. Cat's claw), referred to as PTI-00703, which acts a potent inhibitor of Abeta fibril formation/growth, and causes disruption/disassembly of pre-formed Abeta fibrils. In Phase I of our studies, we used assay guided fractionation and HPLC to isolate, test and characterize active ingredients within PTI-00703 that possess potent AB fibrillogenesis inhibitory activity. A number of major ingredients (collectively known as PTI-777) were purified and tested in relevant in vitro and animal model assays, and found to possess extremely potent Abeta fibrillogenesis inhibitory activity. In Phase II proposed studies, we will complete structural identification of each of the PTI-777 active components, and pre-clinical studies including in vitro and in vivo blood-brain-barrier penetration studies, use of relevant rat and plaque- producing transgenic mouse models to determine potential inhibitory effects on prevention and clearance of brain amyloid plaques, behavioral studies in rodents, and safety/toxicology, and biodistribution studies for the ultimate identification of a clinical drug candidate. These studies are anticipated to lead to the identification of a new drug candidate for the treatment of Abeta amyloidosis in AD and related disorders which involves use of a naturally-derived compound. Knowledge gained from these studies will also identify structural parameters necessary for the design of new anti-amyloid therapeutics for the treatment of AD and other amyloidoses. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Alzheimer's disease (AD) currently affects 4-5 million Americans, at an estimated cost of $80-$100 billion. Currently, there is no cure or substantially effective treatment, and the patient usually dies within 3- 10 years from disease onset. Identification of a natural plant-derived inhibitor of Abeta amyloid fibrillogenesis is anticipated to lead to the development of a new drug(s) for the treatment of AD and related disorders.",

Using this technology, we have begun to develop       in vitro screening technologies and a new non-trangenic rodent model of amyloid      plaque deposition and persistence, which is being used to rapidly identify           potential anti-amyloid plaque therapeutics that target amyloid plaque a)             deposition, b) persistence and/or c) dissolution and clearance in brain.

The studies described will further establish in vitro screening and                  non-transgenic animal modeling technologies for the identification of new            compounds that target amyloid plaque accumulation as it pertains to AD and           prion diseases.

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant): Tools to monitor immune cell interactions       and their consequences will accelerate development of successful                     immunotherapies for cancer, HIV disease, and autoimmune disorders. High levels       of autofluorescence and spectral overlap limit use of stable fluorescent labels      for cell proteins or membranes with other visible probes. High levels of tissue      absorption and scattering preclude real time optical imaging in intact animals.                                                                                           PTIR has synthesized five new cell tracking dyes fluorescing in the 667-837 nm       range (far red - near infrared). S/N for labeled cells were up to 15x of those       for PKH26; spectral overlap properties were suitable for use with many other         fluorescent probes; and feasibility criteria for chemical stability,                 photostability, and lack of effect on cell viability and growth were met.            Labeled cells were also readily imaged in superficial lung microvessels using        intact organ microscopy and at subcutaneous injections sites in nude mice,           attesting to the potential for noninvasive, whole body imaging.                                                                                                           In Phase II PTIR will develop two kits f or preclinical use and screening and        initiate studies to support a clinical cell tracking dye. The first kit will be      for standard 3-4 color instruments, the second for high-end instrumentation.         Our collaborators will evaluate both kits by monitoring proliferation of             lymphocyte subsets, determining the depth to which tumor cells can be tracked        in intact lung preparations from rats, and determining the minimum number of         cells which can be imaged at deep vs. superficial sites in intact animals.           PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  Membrane labeling dyes emitting in the far red or near infrared have significant commercial  potential in three markets; 1) a research market serving both basic and clinical investigators  using flow cytometers; 2) a similar and rapidly growing market in optical imaging, especially  intact organ or whole body imaging; and for molecules with suitable photochemical  properties, 3) photodiagnosis and/or phototherapy.",

At the conclusion of Phase II, this concept prototype will undergo beta testing and be ready for review by potential investors and full commercialization on a national scale. The site will serve as a state-of-the-art regional portal with the intention of replicating this model at selected rural locations throughout the U.S. This site anticipates the mass consumer utilization of broadband communications and integration of next stages of computing and information technology. The site will be designed to be engaging, streamlined, user-friendly, readily accessible, highly informative, well-managed--and profitable within five to seven years. Its continuously updated and fresh content will feature artistic/crafts, heritage, scenic, and geographic highlights of the region, which invite self-selected regional explorations, personal interactions, and e-commerce transactions from heritage tourists and craft buyers in the U.S. And abroad.",

The system form factor and human factors considerations will also be further refined.During the first portion of the program the PVPAEO team will rapidly develop a brass board system to demonstrate the new sensors, real time fusion capability and target data acquisition and transmission functions.   After the demonstration of this system,three hardened systems will be prepared to support an extensive field evaluation.   These systems will be based on the final design form factor and include a lightweight, low power fusion processor.   The results of the field evaluation will beincorporated in the final production design data package.  The proposed system will provide SOF operators with the ability to examine, locate and engage targets during darkness and limited visibility conditions.  The system will also allow the operator to share target imagery and data with other team members.The system will provide real time fusion of the image data to provide optimum image characteristics in all conditions.  The combination of these advanced features will provide the SOF operator with a significant operational advantage over current singlesensor systems",

The laser source, a compact, quasi-cw diode-pumped, 1 kHz pulse-repetition-rate, passively Q-switched Nd:YLF laser, will pump a tandem OPO system consisting of an angle-tuned, 1.5-3.6 micron KTA OPO, and a pump-tuned, 3-5 micron and 8-12micron CdSe OPO pumped by the KTA OPO idler. In the Phase I effort we demonstrated an IR-source consisting of (1) an efficient, 1 kHz repetition rate, 1-micron laser source generating nsec pulses at average power of 8 W; (2) a tunable KTA OPO with acombined signal and idler average power of 2.6 W at a 1 kHz repetition rate; (3) a KTA OPO idler-pumped CdSe OPO. Phase II development will emphasize technology that is ultimately rugged, lightweight and efficient in terms of prime-power use, and can beemployed for a soldier-portable chemical-weapons sensor. At the completion of the Phase II effort we will deliver to the Army a laboratory prototype.  The proposed IR Laser Source will enhance selectivity and sensitivity of chemical agent identification ina low cost standoff detector. In the commercial sector the applications include wide-area pollution monitoring, process control and general scientific investigations.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This proposal seeks to improve the performance of density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in the commercial quantum chemistry software package Q-Chem. DFT strikes the right balance between accuracy and computational cost, and is used to model molecular processes in a wide variety of disciplines, including biology, chemistry, and materials science. In the work of our Phase I SBIR, we developed a novel method, called IncDFT, short for incremental DFT, that reduced the computational cost of the most time consuming step in DFT energy calculations by a factor of two. IncDFT, takes advantage of the iterative nature of DFT calculations by reusing, rather than recomputing, computationally expensive quantities that differ insignificantly between iteration cycles. In this Phase II proposal, IncDFT will be developed for all major aspects of DFT calculations in Q-Chem, including computation of the energy with gradient corrected functionals, the evaluation of critical points on the potential energy surface, the computation of the analytical Hessian, and calculation of excited electronic states. Care will also be taken to maintain Q-Chem's excellent parallel efficiency. The successful completion of this project will allow Q-Chem to provide its end-users with a software package that will significantly reduce the execution time for calculations employing DFT, thereby greatly increasing their productivity accordingly. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: DFT is the preferred computational model in many areas of chemical and biological research due to its accuracy. Still, its application can be time-consuming. The research in the Phase II proposal will produce a faster version of Q-Chem for DFT calculations, which will enable users to finish their calculations in less time, or run calculations on larger molecular systems with the same cost. Thus, their productivity will be significantly enhanced.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Q-DOT proposes to develop a wide bandwidth, highly versatile Direct Digital Synthesizer (DDS) System capable of supporting multiple radar and communication systems.  A common, highly capable DDS System will simplify logistics, training and maintenance,thereby significantly reducing Operation and Support Cost.  Bar-Giora Goldberg, co-founder of Sciteq, and world-renown DDS innovator, will guide the DDS architectural design.     A single DDS System will provide 2 GHz of bandwidth with a robust menu of modulations (FSK, PSK, QPSK, QAM) and <60 dB spurious free dynamic range (SFDR).  The DDS System will be realized with IBM's production SiGe BiCMOS process that combinesadvanced HBT with state-of-the-art CMOS to produce sophisticated yet inexpensive mixed-signal integrated circuits.     This effort will build on Q-DOT's experience in designing and building SiGe MMIC's, including VCO, PPL, active mixer, ADC, and DAC.  The proposed DAC portion of the DDS system will be based on an existing part designed to achieve 14-bit, 5 Gs/s,>80 dBSFDR and realized at Q-DOT in SiGe BiCMOS.     Phase II will result in a robust DDS ready for fabrication.  The DDS chip will be fabricated and packaged with the existing DAC to yield deliverable DDS systems suitable for evaluation.  The DAC will be refined in Phase IIIA to improve its performanceand compatibility with the DDS chip.  The DDS chip will be enhanced in Phase IIIB to incorporate DAC compensation circuitry.   Finally, the DAC will be dynamically compensated during Phase IIIC to increase its linearity.  Two internationally recognizedcompanies have expressed interest in supporting the Phase III effort and bringing the resulting products to market.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Innovative approaches are required to make the interferometric testing of large aspheric, and/or non-axisymmetric surfaces both flexible and cost effective.  QED proposes to develop a scanning, off-axis, subaperture system aimed at extending thecapabilities of interferometric testing to cover larger clear apertures (200mm), larger numerical apertures (0.5), and larger aspheric departures (>200 waves), with increased accuracy through calibration.  This system represents a significant advance that,with further development, could offer general test capabilities for a wider range of conformal optics.  Our system's success relies on the proposed innovations for efficient subaperture stitching, automatic system calibration, absolute measurements, andextended dynamic range through high-density interference fringe analysis.  Fundamentally limiting challenges to aspheric metrology are addressed principally by automatic calibration to remove the errors associated with aberrations in both the imagingoptics and in the reference wave, as well as corrections for positioning errors and image distortion.  Success in Phase I has provided the foundation for the Phase II tasks of developing a fully automated metrology system for more strongly aspheric optics.Our prospects for success in both developing and commercializing the final product are greatly enhanced by the fact that QED has entered into a co-development collaboration with a leading interferometer supplier.",

Therefractometer will be capable of accurately (better than 01.0 ppm)sensing atmospheric refractive index gradients and turbulentfluctuations at sufficiently small scales so that it can be used tovalidate signal propagation models used/proposed to predictperformance of a variety of VHF, UHF microwave and optical communications and sensing systems.  Solid state microwave and signal processing electronics will be used to activate a sensing cavity, to process its output signal and to display atmosphericrefractive index fluctuations in real time.  The sensing cavity will be modified using a low cost, high stability material, such as electroplated ceramic or glaze.  To minimize adverse effects of turbulence at high air speeds, the sensing cavity will beenclosed in a flow controlling aerodynamic housing.  Comparative evaluation of the instrument will be done using critical components from a Thompson-Vetter laboratory standard refractometer.  Calibration and field testing will be performed at the RockSprings micrometeorological/turbulence field site at Penn State University. As research progresses, we will work with the Air Force to arrange a high altitude aircraft test of the prototype unit. This will require a source of additional funding.",

The system demonstrated that it could schedule the hundreds (500 to 600) of tasks per day required well within the expected time frame of a few hours for next-day scheduling.  We arepresently creating a scheduling language and investigating new techniques for improving performance.In Phase II, we will create a Scheduling and Planning Framework (SPF) which builds upon the phase I proof of concept and incorporates the new performance improving techniques.  We will build a scheduling system for the AFSCN problem that goes beyond thesimple proof of principle and solves the real scheduling problem.  We will also solve the spacelift range asset scheduling problem.  Both solutions will be built on the SPF using unique data input and output interfaces.",

Their operation remains plagued by unacceptably high false alarm rates; 70% of remediation costs go to the excavation of shrapnel,spent bullet casings, and other clutter.  Quantum Magnetics proposes a revolutionary enhancement to conventional metal detectors.  Using a multi-component magnetic gradiometer as the receiver enables not only detection, but also localization, of an object.Wideband, multi-frequency excitation and advanced signal processing (collaborating with Duke University) can characterize metallic targets, discriminating mines and UXO from clutter.  The system is a single tool to detect, locate and characterize bothlandmines and UXO.  It lends itself to integration with other sensor technologies, such as ground-penetrating radar, soil conductivity anomaly sensors, and Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance (NQR).  QM is the world leader in NQR for detection of bulk explosivecharges in landmines.  In Phase I, we will collect passive (magnetic) and active (electromagnetic) signatures of various types of simulant mines (SIMs) and clutter; we will then use these signatures to demonstrate the enhanced discrimination afforded bywideband excitation and signal processing.  In Phase II, we will develop a prototype using gradiometer technology leveraged from other efforts.",

A 1-inch-diameter impulse turbine, driven by bottled nitrogen gas, delivered torque to a ball screw linear output through a 33.6:1 speed reduction. The turbine was operated at speeds of at least 140,000 rpm withoutdamage, and loads up to 50 pounds were lifted at speeds up to about 10 in/sec, far exceeding the require-ments of the original solicitation. In Phase II Quoin will fully develop the Free Piston Engine power supply/air compressor and electrical powergenerator technology. We will design, build and test two generations of the system. The PFE will provide enough power for all actuators and other exoskeleton requirement, in a unit smaller than a soup can. We will also conduct system dynamic performanceanalysis. The practical and economical potential of an exoskeleton powered by a chemo-mechanical actuator is far-reaching for both military and civilian commerce and industry.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION(adapted from applicant's abstract): Neuroscience researchers wish        to understand the nature of the processing tasks executed within different           areas of the nervous system, the codes by which information is represented           during the execution of these tasks, and the nature of the neural machinery          with which computational algorithms are executed. However, there are major           technological problems blocking progress. One major hurdle is the ability to         record from hundreds to thousands of neurons simultaneously at high acquisition      rates for long durations. A second hurdle is that researchers need to analyze        the massive data streams \"on the fly\" to enable real-time interactive                management and control of the systems under study. R. C. Electronics proposes        to develop instrumentation to satisfy these requirements and plans to develop a      Massive Acquisition and Analysis System (MAAS). Unlike current data acquisition      systems that are difficult to scale up to hundreds or thousands of channels,         MAAS will take advantage of commercially available network technology to             collect and transfer multi-channel high speed data at a 500+ Mbits/sec               aggregate rate to a distributed processing system for real-time analysis. The        system will also take advantage of using standard network protocol to deliver        the data to remote researchers for \"Tele-Research\" applications.

Foil air bearings do provide a promising choice in meeting these goals.  Foil air bearingsare successfully being used in air cycle machines of aircraft environmental control systems.  They have shown excellent reliability, maintainability and reduced cost for these machines.  Application of foil bearings for gas turbine engines require furtherresearch and development.  A new generation of foil bearings is proposed, which is suitable for gas turbine engines.In Phase I, feasibility of the proposed approach has been shown by testing the new generation of foil bearings.  In Phase II, a design method will be developed using a multiple regression method.  A super-critical rotor dynamics simulator supported on foilbearings will be built and tested.  Foil bearings will be installed in the Ingersoll-Rand PowerWorks gas turbine and tested under actual high temperature environmental conditions.  In Phase III, foil bearings will be tested in Williams Internationalengines WR-24-8 and EJ-22.  The Allison JETEC engine will be modified to incorporate a foil bearing on the hot end and tested.  A report will be written summarizing the results.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In this proposed Phase II program we will develop board-level optical waveguides to alleviate the ever-tightening electrical interconnection bottleneck.  VLSI provides fast intrinsic signal speeds but these speeds cannot be supported by electricalinterconnects between other chips on the same board.   Conversion to optical interconnects at the intra-board level can overcome these limits.  The practical limits of optical interconnects arises from the optoelectronic transmitters and receivers, whichcurrently have bandwidths up to 10GHZ.  The emerging 40-GHz OC-768 telecommunications standard is a strong indication that optical interconnects will keep pace with VLSI for many years.  However, their cost-effective assimilation into conventionaltechnologies remains the major unresolved issue.  Therefore, we propose an optoelectronic board-level bus employing a fully imbedded optical interconnection layer based on polymeric waveguides, thin-film vertical-cavity-surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) andthin-film metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) photodetectors, integrated onto a PCB structure and planarized to allow conventional integration of noncritical electrical interconnects.  Optical couplers will couple light between the transceivers and the chipsmounted on the boards's surface.  By demonstrating these integrations we will prove the practicality of high speed board-level optical interconnects, which should lead to Phase III commercialization.  The proposed technology to be developed replacesboard-level electrical interconnects with optical interconnects for critical high-speed signals.  Because the optical interconnectivity layer is embedded in an otherwise conventional printed circuit board (PCB), this technology supports conventional PCBdesign and fabrication practices.  Electronics engineers can design systems utilizing both electrical and high-speed optical interconnects without concerning themselves with the unfamiliar optical technologies.  This should result in broad marketacceptance.  Once accepted the technology should continue to be useful for many years as advancements in telecommunications optoelectronic devices are readily incorporated into the board level optical interconnects.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         We propose to test a new method for remote passive detection of hydrometeors (cloud liquid water droplets, drizzle, rain, hail, and snow) from an aircraft. The method uses an advanced radiometer to measure differences between horizontal and vertical polarization of microwave radiation. The polarization is influenced by hydrometeor shape and the anisotropy of the illuminating flux. This allows discrimination between liquid water and ice crystals. Radiometrics Corporation conceived the new method and is applying for patent. Based on preliminary simple modeling, the capability of the new method appears fairly certain. We propose to confirm our preliminary results with more rigorous modeling. We also have conceived of three concepts to obtain range information on icing conditions. The capabilities of the concepts are uncertain and we propose modeling and testing. In addition, we propose to explore the performance of a method for passive airborne measurement of atmospheric temperature structure. This method is based on a highly accurate ground-based radiometric temperature profiling method that has recently emerged from Russia. Knowledge of temperature structure is important for prediction of icing conditions and turbulence.",

Effective Anti-Jam (AJ) techniques are required to ensure continuity, integrity, and availability of the GPS service for JPALS. Current nullsteering approaches fall short, given the need for carrier phase tracking.Radix Technologies has developed and demonstrated an effective, concurrent digital beamforming and null steering anti-jam technology called BEAMSTAR, which enables acquisition and tracking of GPS signals in highly jammed environments.  The approachoptimizes a seperate beam in the direction of each SV, while simultaneously minimizing the interference plus noise environment.  This SV-unique optimization provides superior protection over approaches that apply a common weight vector to all SVs.  AMatlabT simulation was developed and used to evaluate the patented Code Gated Maximum Likelihood (CGML) technique used in BEAMSTAR and to compare the performance of CGML to other approaches and showed significant performance improvement .Under a Phase I SBIR contract, Radix has developed a suitably modified simulation of the CGML technique for inclusion in GIANT, a simulation tool used to determine system performance and operational effectiveness in a GPS/INS environment.The proposed Phase II SBIR effort will yield a demonstration AJ GPS receiver modified for JPALS purposes that incorporates the multibeam CGML technique.",

Resultant simulations cover a diverse set of simulation paradigms that may differ intiming, resolution, scope, platforms, infrastructures and languages. The existing infrastructures and frameworks are not capable of resolving differences concerning resolution and fidelity found in such diverse simulations. RAM Laboratories' Phase IIeffort will develop a technology that semi-automates the development of middleware and model wrappers that can be used to resolve fidelity differences between models using mixed resolution modeling (MRM) techniques.  This technology will allow for theimplementation of MRM interfaces utilizing a wide range of techniques including distribution and equation based techniques to advanced clustering algorithms. Use of this technology will facilitate model re-use by allowing companies to co-simulate modelsfrom diverse modeling paradigms without having to rebuild their models, thus allowing commercial companies to take advantage of legacy and third party simulation models that may already exist. The use of these models would result in great savings in termsof model construction, model validation, and model verification.",

In futuremulti-static, multi-receiver search missions, the number of alertsis expected to increase dramatically.  Tactical scenarios presenta further complication because response time is critical and, as aresult, classification in the fewest number of pings is cruciallyimportant.  Historically, the decluttering issue has beenaddressed by estimating parameters of active acoustic returns andcomparing those returns against thresholds.  Unfortunately, thesethresholds are highly sensitive to the environment.  The proposed Phase II research intends to developenvironmentally robust signal processing algorithms thatsignificantly reduce clutter, improve detection, and performquickly.  To address these issues, the Phase II effort proposes tofurther develop and evaluate several techniques initiated underthe Phase I SBIR. This includes a CFAR threshold based on the(possibly) non-Gaussian statistics of the matched filter or energydetector output.  The second is to develop a classification metricbased on acoustic return similarity for distinguishing targetsfrom clutter.  The other techniques include spatial clutterreduction and decision fusion algorithms. The algorithms will betested using real sea data, and transitioned to real timeprototypes.",

This has proven to be a technically challenging,lengthy (20 year projected effort) and costly ($15 billion and increasing)endeavor. Incineration technology is the basis for most of the chemicaldemilitarization activities. Improved incineration analysis and designtools can greatly assist the Army in accomplishing this task safely,efficiently and economically, while ensuring protection of public healthand the environment.In Phase I we have:  obtained and used a full chemical mechanism for theGB simulant DMMP and showed by two methods the destruction of DMMP wascomplete and extremely rapid in a liquid incinerator and a metals partsfurnace; constructed and exercised four CFD models of incineratorcomponents; and demonstrated these models are useful for exploringscenarios relevant to chemical demilitarization incinerator operation.In Phase II we will: identify chemical mechanisms for GB & VX nerveagents and mustard that allow the identification of PICs; extend thecapability of existing CFD modules for transient operation and developother modules; benchmark the incinerator models; and demonstratethe utility of an engineering design workbench to improveincinerator performance.",

Inclusion of detailed chemistry into 3D simulations with turbulence-chemistry interaction will be computationally intractable for the foreseeable future. Practical simulation of reacting flows requires reduced mechanisms tailored to the application and conditions of interest. The PSE created in Phase I allows the user to rapidly create reduced mechanisms, set up multi-parameter test problems for comparison to detailed chemistry, and interrogate and visualize the results more thoroughly than was previously possible. Human effort for reduced mechanism validation is reduced from days to hours. Rigorous testing is necessary to make reduced mechanisms a reliable commercial product. In Phase II the PSE will be extended to automatically optimize reduced mechanisms to the users' specification, and produce reduced mechanism modules for a variety of applications that seamlessly integrate into a variety of Computational Fluid Dynamics codes. These technologies will have commercial value due to the ever-increasing need to include more detailed chemistry into the design and analysis software used by scientists and engineers. The problem solving environment provides the engineer with the ability to rapidly create reduced mechanisms, set up multiple test problems covering a multidimensional parameter space for comparison to detailed chemistry, and efficiently interrogate and visualize the results.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is playing an increasingly important role in U.S. industry.  In the aerospace industry, where the cost of construction and operation of sub-scale and prototype units increases significantly with the increase in size andspeed of aircraft, CFD plays an important role as an adjunct to experimentation in reducing the costs of testing and scale-up and the time to take the product to market.  To date, CFD codes have incorporated only very simplified descriptions of thechemistry.  In many cases, this is not sufficient, and more detailed representations of the chemistry must be used.  Within the proposed Phase II program, we will be integrating technology in several key areas to develop a capability for CFD modeling ofscramjet combustion that has not, as yet, been fully realized for practical application.  The key technologies include state-of-the-art detailed mechanisms for aviation fuels, an automated procedure for detailed mechanism reduction, a 3-D turbulentreactive flow code for simulation of high-speed combusting flows, novel tabulation procedures to improve the computational efficiency of CFD simulations, and PDF techniques to account for turbulence-chemistry interactions.",

Such systems are intended to maintain an ongoing interaction with their environment in order to provide appropriate responses to stimuli the environment generates. Examples include the embedded software found in medical, automotive, aeronautical, consumer-electronic, e-commerce, and telecommunications applications. Many of these are safety- or business-critical. Providing an enabling technology for the cost-effective development of correctly functioning reactive systems would thus be of great social and economic benefit to the nation. The main tangible outcome of the proposed effort and the flagship product will be the React tool environment. React will allow reactive-system designers to create mathematical models of their systems; validate models via simulation and automatic verification; and automatically generate implementations or test suites from models. The key innovation of the proposed technology is its reliance on powerful formal techniques, developed by RSI for modeling systems and validating properties of these models in a fully automatic fashion",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The interaction of radio frequency electromagnetic energy with the human body is best computed with finite difference methods.  For good accuracy, especially at higher frequencies, the human body description requires many millions of individual voxels. Thevoxels fill the entire volume of the body and describe both the outer surface and interior organs of the body.  Making one detailed voxel mesh of the human body is a significant project that may take years of effort.  The result will be a voxel mesh foronly one position of the body.  However, different applications require the body limbs to be repositioned.  The body might be seated, keeling, standing, or holding a cellular phone.  Modifying the voxel mesh of the body to the new positions whilemaintaining the integrity of the internal organs is a difficult task, beyond the capabilities of currently-available computer aided design software.  During the Phase I effort an approach to this problem was demonstrated by rotating the 1mm voxel anklejoint and demonstrating continuity of the rotated nerves and blood vessels.  In this effort the complete ability to manipulate large three-dimensional voxel-based meshes, primarily of the human body, while maintaining the fidelity of the mesh, will bedeveloped.",

Replicon Technologies, Incorporated (RTI) has developed a unique gene        therapy strategy based on RNA vectors (replicons) with the potential to              overcome limitations in the treatment of malignancies of the CNS, including          primary cancers of the brain. In the Phase I project, we used a xenogeneic           intracranial glioma mouse model to evaluate the feasibility of replicons for         the treatment of malignant brain tumors. We have demonstrated that the               treatment of tumor-bearing mice with replicons results in a significant              enhancement of survival. In the Phase II project, RTI will optimize                  manufacturing protocols which will be suitable for large-scale production under      GMP conditions. Methods for quality control testing wil also be developed.           These parameters will be implemented in a pilot feasibility study with a viral       vector manufacturing company for small-scale production of GMP-quality replicon      preparations that will then be evaluated for safety and toxicity in two              appropriate animal species. Data generated from these studies will be used to        support an Investigational New Drug (IND) application filing with the FDA to         allow for a Phase I clinical study of the replicons.

Our novel discovery has lead us to proposed that the            increased plasma level of iNOS can serve as a valid biochemical marker to            prognosticate the onset of SIRS and/or sepsis and to monitor a patient's             condition as it improves or deteriorates. Our goal is to develop an innovative       new clinical diagnostic that can rapidly detect, quantitate and monitor this         increase in iNOS prior to the onset of severe sepsis and septic shock, and thus      provide an early warning signal for future deleterious events. An early              diagnosis will provide a basis for the earlier initiation of therapies than is       currently practiced. The results from two prior studies indicate that an             increased plasma level of iNOS can be detected and measured in patients with         SIRS and/or sepsis, occurs early in an episode of SIRS and/or sepsis, and            forecasts future problems. The aims of this phase 2 project are (1) to extend        the study to 400 patients in order to assess if the observations made on two         smaller cohorts of patients are generally applicable and (2) to determine if         the increased plasma level of iNOS in SIRS and sepsis is unique to this              pathology and does not occur in other diseases associated with an over               expression of iNOS. Once completed, this project will bring a unique and much        needed new clinical diagnostic onto the market, and this, in turn, will lead to      improved health care for critically ill patients.    PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Over 1,200,000 cases/yr of systemic inflammatory response syndrome and sepsis occur in the USA; these lead to over 500,000 cases/yr of severe sepsis and septic shock and 100,000 - 250,000 deaths/yr. A rapid test to assess a patient's entry into and progress down the sepsis pathway to severe sepsis and septic shock is needed. Our EIA is designed to meet this clinical need, to lower patient cost by reducing the length of ICU stays. and to improve patient outcome.",

The device will be the worlds first compact, electrically controllable, dynamic focusing liquid crystal (LC) microlens reading/writing device for 3D data storage, and has the potential to revolutionize optical data storage and retrieval. The device will dramatically increase both the reading and writing speed of conventional CD/DVD systems and multi-layer DVDs and will be the enabling component in the next generation of truly 3D data storage technologies. In Phase I, the feasibility of the technology was demonstrated and tested various dynamic liquid crystal lens structures to gain an understanding of the issues of design, fabrication, and optical properties of LC microlenses. Building on this success, Phase II is dedicated to the optimization of the LC microlens structures and the development of a fast-switching dynamic focusing LC microlens with large variable focal length range and numerical aperture. Finally, a microlens array to develop parallel reading/writing devices will be designed and built. A prototype 3D reading device will be demonstrated. In Phase III, Reveo will commercialize the new technology. Optical storage offers higher capacities, removable platters, and more durable media than magnetic disk storage, but it is limited by slow access speeds and higher costs of drives and media. The first product to be developed from the microlens technology will be an electrically-controllable, dynamic-focusing liquid crystal microlens device for integration into the data reading system of current DVD players and other optical storage drivers. The device will maximize retrieval efficiency of current optical storage media so customers can immediately enjoy the benefits of 3D data storage technology",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is designed to develop and commercialize high-durability UV polarizer optics with unprecedented performance. The breakthrough polarizers are made from stacks of oriented, birefringent thin film layers, which are obtained by vacuum deposition at an oblique angle. The film material itself is optically isotropic, but the birefringence arises from the nanostructure of the layers in the film stack. Films can be constructed from a single material, relieving the conventional constraints on material transparency and enabling a wider operating wavelength range. Using LiF as the film material, for example, could extend the operating range down to 110 nm. Extension to the far UV and extreme UV appears possible with materials such as silicon carbide or boron carbide. The deposition technique thus offers an exciting opportunity to engineer unique film properties. In Phase II, the investigator proposes to enlarge the database of film materials for UV chiral film polarizers and design, fabricate (using a customized deposition system), and characterize UV chiral film polarizers for practical applications. The investigator will then develop high-speed deposition techniques to ensure the polarizers are low-cost. Commercialization activities will accelerate in Phase III. The inorganic UV polarizer films may have several advantages over conventional polarizer components, and become key devices in many important industrial manufacturing processes, including systems for chemical synthesis, drug development, and liquid crystal alignment for LCDs",

As envisioned, this novel technology can be used toproduce fibers possessing electronic and structural properties superior to those of conventional fibers based on carbon, polymers, ceramics, or currently available composites.  The results obtained during Phase I clearly validate ReyTech's approach andprovide a solid foundation for Phase II work.Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of establishing a technology platform for developing fibers containing covalently bound CNT's.  The key innovation being assessed was ReyTech's unique approach to functionalizing CNT's to chemically bond the CNT to thefiber polymer.  All Phase I tasks/objectives were completed, and all Phase I goals were met or exceeded.  Specifically, fibers containing functionalized CNT's were produced that exhibited significantly improved electronic and structural performance (e.g.,enhanced electrical conductivity, novel electronic properties, improved mechanical properties).  These initial results strongly indicate the potential for these fibers to meet the needs anticipated for next-generation applications for the Army, and Phase Isuccess sets the stage for the proposed Phase I Option work and for a Phase II project focused on optimization, prototyping, and validation/field-testing.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Through the Phase I SBIR process, Rini Technologies Inc. has demonstrated the feasibility of using evaporative spray cooling to reduce the temperature of high power laser diode stacks below the temperature at which they currently operate.  This reductionin temperature, while operating at high power, results in increased laser efficiency, extended lifetime and reliability, as well as the ability to overdrive the output power above the rated power limit.  The Phase II effort will focus on the development ofa prototype system that will cool a 1.4Kw diode laser source.  The size of the stack will be 1cm x 7cm.  During the development of the prototype, the following issues will be addressed; 1) scaling the spray technique from cooling 1cm2 to 7cm2, 2) designingand fabricating a compact nozzle array to spray the larger surface, 3) designing and fabricating a compact and efficient condenser unit to reduce the overall size of the system, and 4) selecting the optimum liquid pump to reduce cavitations, vibration andpower consumption.  The prototype system will use a diode laser source provided by Decade Optical Systems, Inc. (DOS) DOS is a commercial and military solid state and diode laser manufacturer.  They have partnered with RTI, and are providing matching funds($200k) for the Phase II development, and intend to purchase a spray-cooled system from RTI once the prototype development is complete.  The first application of the spray cooled laser system is a 100kW solid-state laser (the Heat Capacity Laser) beingbuilt by the Army Space and Missile Defense Command (ASMDC).  The Army intends to use RTI's evaporative spray cooling technology as the cooling source for the high power diode lasers that are the light source for the solid-state laser.  ASMDC is likely toprovide matching funds to RTI as a level of $1.3M over the duration of the SBIR contract if this funding becomes available from the Joint Technology Office.  The prototype cooling system will be developed at RTI's facility in Orlando, Fl, primarily by RTIpersonal.  RTI will work with engineers from DOS to aid the design of the laser-to-cooler interface.  The benefit of this prototype to high power diode lasers is a reduced operating temperature without increasing cooling costs.  This is accomplished byimplementing a more efficient cooling mechanism.  With reduced diode temperature, efficiency, lifetime and reliability are all increased.  Potential markets include any high power diode application, such as, military weapons and countermeasures;industrial metal processing (welding, cutting, drilling); printing and surface marking.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Before communication can take place between a transmitter and its intended receiver in a frequency hopping communication system, the hopping pattern of the receiver must be in synchronism with the hoppping pattern of the transmitter. The development oftechniques for the rapid achievment of this synchronization is one of the most important and challenging tasks in the design of frequency hopping systems.Current solutions to this problem involve sending synchronization or timing information to thereceiver by means of an auxilary channel or by sending the information necessary to synchronize in some non frequency-hopping format. These attempts to address the synchronization problem tend to degrade system performance. The objective of the proposedPhase II program is the design, development and fabrication of a self- synchronizing spread spectrum communication systems. These systems will exploit newly developed analytical techniques that can enable a monitor to synchronize to a frequency hoppingradio by making relatively brief observtions of its frequency- hopping pattern. More specifically, these algorithms enable a frequency-hopping receiver to synchronize to a hopping transmitter by observing the relative times-of-arrival of a singlefrequency.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Not Available This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project from RSK Assessments, Inc. will expand and improve upon the test battery implemented for Phase I, including cross validation, examination of other behavioral scoring approaches (signal detection theory, Bayesian methods), other agents (viz., sleep loss) as well as the interplay of these methods on special purpose hardware and new software. Phase I examined the feasibility of conducting human performance-based fitness-for-duty (FFD) testing as an alternative to chemically-based testing. The testing method was brief and inexpensive, and the tests were stable and reliable. Using a multiple cut-off analysis varying proportion of tests passed, they yielded 98+% specificity (minimal false positives) with 80% sensitivity for high dosages of alcohol (and 60% for low). The new battery tightens security, running within self-contained kiosks and providing data encryption and access via smart card usage. Improved managerial control will be implemented within the test system, including test control and scheduling, data analysis methods, and reporting. Additional means of quantifying behavioral decrements will be obtained from sleep deprivation research, analyses of past alcohol research, and an \"alpha\" test site. Data from these sources will yield a better assessment model and refine calculations for tradeoff between test length, specificity, and sensitivity. RSK Assessments proffers a tool for testing human performance that could facilitate higher productivity in industrial plants, a means of testing employees while in the field, and reduction in worker on-the-job injuries.",

Fiber opticsare now heavily used in long distance telecommunications as wellas high-speed data communications and are rapidly gaining marketshare in desktop LANs. There have been great technicaladvancements recently in optoelectronics manufacturing andconsequently in the performance of fiber optic links whichutilize the advanced optoelectronics components. However,automated computer-aided design (CAD) tools for the design offiber optic links have not followed the same pace of development.There is a lack of reliable software for the simulation,analysis, and design of fiber optic links. The continuingadvancement of fiber optics technologies requires that CAD toolsfor their design be developed which will accurately model all thesignificant performance degradations and nonlinear effectsinherent in these systems to facilitate their designoptimization.

This project will be known as the Visual Expert System Programming Resource, or VESPR. The visual environment will provide a graphical interface for easily capturing knowledge and converting it into the appropriate language constructs; it will also provide visualization of the system being developed. VESPR will also automatically provide scaffolding to simplify the development of features common to expert systems. By using an existing expert system development language, the project will be able to leverage the work already done on the language and have an existing pool of potential users available. The most important asset that NASA owns is flight knowledge. How to fly space vehicles. This knowledge is unique to NASA, and most of it is confined to a few experienced flight controllers and mission specialists. Expert systems can represent that knowledge in a permanent, flexible, and useful fashion. The knowledge can be saved and used easily. Unfortunately, creation of an expert system is an expensive, time-consuming task, requiring, at a minimum, both an expert who possesses the knowledge that needs to be captured, and an expert programmer.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) The decriminalization of medicinal               marijuana in numerous states has increased the demand for research on how            marijuana affects patients. Unfortunately, there is currently no standard means      for assessing the cognitive and neurophysiological changes resulting from            marijuana smoking. Accordingly, we propose to develop a self-contained device,       the NICE (Neurocognitive Index of Cannabis Effects) system, to objectively and       efficiently assess marijuana-related changes in cognitive brain function. In         Phase I we collected data from ten recreational marijuana users before and           after the smoked marijuana cigarettes containing an active or a placebo dose of      THC. After smoking marijuana subjects were less accurate in a test of                intermediate-term memory, and responses in a sustained attention/working memory      task were slower. Marijuana produced large concomitant changes in task-related       EEG and event-related potentials. Multivariate combinations of performance and       neurophysiological measures readily tracked the neurocognitive changes               following marijuana smoking. The Phase I project also contributed to the             ongoing design of a compact and highly automated testing and analysis system.        In Phase II we propose to extend and further validate our procedures for             classifying marijuana's effects on an individual basis using a larger database,      fully implement a prototype system, and subject it to independent evaluation         studies.

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop an efficient,             user-friendly, and cost-effective system for objectively assessing any               impairments or improvements in cognitive function that might occur consequent        to the administration of drugs used to treat psychiatric disorders. The              NeuroCognitive Assessment Meter (NCAM) will combine neurophysiological and           behavioral measures to exploit the complementary forms of information that they      provide. In prior work we have found that such an approach can yield                 multivariate indices that are highly sensitive to cognitive changes produced by      drugs and other interventions. In Phase I new neurophysiological and cognitive       perfonnance data were collected from ten healthy subjects before and after           ingestion of a placebo or a commonly prescribed anxiolytic. Results from this        study indicated that the multivariate indexing methods we have developed             generalized well to this new intervention. The Phase I project also contributed      to the design of a compact and easy-to-use automated testing and analysis            system that will provide the infrastructure for a commercial-grade NCAM.             Together these developments support the scientific and technical viability of        the NCAM. In Phase II we plan to further develop and validate our procedures         using a larger database, fully implement a prototype system, subject it to           independent evaluation, and develop a commercialization strategy.      PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The NCAM will serve as an enabling technology for researchers evaluating whether  cognitive impairment or improvement occurs as a side effect or intended effect  of drugs administered to treat psychiatric disorders. It will also be useful to the  pharmaceutical industry during the drug development process. The system could  also have a high clinical impact in helping to choose the most effective drug and  dosage in the treatment of individual psychiatric patients.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In Phase-I, a Fast Pattern Recognizer (FPR) System was evaluated as a future processor candidate for Navy fast-reaction, supersonic, stand-off weapons. The FPR will autonomously detect, identify, correlate, and track complex ship and land targets inhostile, high-clutter environments in real time. Because image correlation is computationally intensive, real-time processing must be accomplished by means other than traditional hardware and/or software. The FPR uses an electronic implementation analogousto an optical correlator, where the Fourier transform of the incoming image is compared against known target images stored as matched filters. The innovative FPR is ideal for onboard real time missile applications with guidance update rates of 30 times persecond. The FPR technology employs patented novel algorithms and an acoustic dispersive delay line to achieve ultra fast image processing rates at 11,000 correlations per second.Phase II development focuses on real-time FPR design in two stages-first, a mission planning and targeting (MP&T;) subsystem for non-real-time development-and second, an onboard missile subsystem (MFPR) for real-time processing. The MP&T; incorporatesenhanced algorithm design and mission support functions. The MFPR incorporates a digital signal processor (DSP) front-end for real time image conditioning for the FPR to correlate, recognize and track targets.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The proposed Sanders Aerospace ModelMaker (AMM) system provides an innovative rapid prototyping method of fabricating aerospace wind tunnel test models that dramatically increases instrumentation effectiveness with reduced complexity, cost and construction time. The AMM uses an in-situ layered deposition process to build ceramic test models that withstand high temperatures and have fully integrated sensor instrumentation interconnectivity features. The process uses a novel variation of proven low temperature, co-fired ceramics (LTCC) technology employed successfully by the microelectronics industry. The AMM system enables layered fabrication with CNC precision, accuracy, surface smoothness, and high fidelity scale test models of up to eighteen inches. The finite layer resolution allows detailed, high fidelity construction. Composite fabrication enables the body core, low thermal conductivity outer surface, sensor interconnect wiring, and hollow cavity structures as an integral model. The integrated instrumentation wiring can be used to form temperature sensing thermocouples by coating the model with nickel (the thermocouple is formed at the junction of the wire and the nickel) or used in pairs of conductors to connect resistive thermal detectors (RTD's) at up to 128 selected test points. The AMM will revolutionize the aerospace wind tunnel test model construction process and reduce model cost, complexity, and construction time.",

The New Carburizing Technology issimple and inexpensive. There are no limitations to the form,shape, dimensions, or material of the part to be treated. It ispossible to obtain diffusion surface layer thicknesses from themicron range up to several millimeters and to reach carboncontents from 0.8% up to 6% within the time from seconds tominutes. Surface layer form, thickness, chemical composition,structure and properties can be adjusted for various applicationsby varying the inductor design, active medium and processingregime. The process is tightly controlled, thus assuring highpart quality. Research and development performed in Phase I havebeen shown that this technology has a high grade of scientific,technical and commercial fasibility, which has been demonstratedto the Navy. High-frequency induction carburizing can be used asa substitute for conventional furnace carburzing; flame, welding,and induction surfacing by hard alloys; and for some existingmethods of steel anticorrosion protection. This process is a newtreatment method for creating multilayered diffusion coating forimproving surface properties of various special alloys, which arebase, or contain sufficient amounts of carbide forming elementsand for creating seflubricating diffusion coatings.

A single-moving maglev platen will be driven in all six degrees of freedom with three levitation motors. The platen will generate large two-dimensional motions for transportation with small four-axis motions for alignment and small adjustments. It will lead to a clean-room compatible, lightweight, compact, inexpensive structure that can meet demanding dynamic performance requirements in next-generation precision microelectronics manufacturing. Magnetic levitation has many potential applications in microelectronics manufacturing equipment that require precise planar position control, such as wafer steppers, wafer handlers, wire bonders, surface profilometers, scanned probe microscopes, and precision inspection machines. This technology is expected to figure prominently in the highly competitive microelectronics manufacturing capital equipment industry.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The goal of this effort is the design and implementation of QoS network provisioning strategies that (1) permit real time delivery of QoS services by promptly accepting new calls, and (2) enable prompt recovery (within 100-300 ms) from QoS interruption dueto use/network mobility or network failures. QoS support for internet multimedia applications is necessary to meet stringent end-to-end requirements such as bandwidth, delay and priorities, scheduling, traffic classification. To scale the solution to largenetworks, we used MPLS (Multiprotocol label Switching) and Class aggregation using the Diff Serv model. To support path protection and fast recovery, the notion of spare resource pre-allocation on MPLS paths was introduced. In Phase I many of the precedingbuilding blocks were evaluated via simulation. In Phase II we will implement the proposed QoS framework on a small test-bed to demonstrate its effectiveness in a physical network. A hybrid simulation that supports physical deployments linked withsimulation models of larger networks will be used to demonstrate scalable to a heterogeneous network with a backbone as well as local (wired and wireless) subnets.",

In it's simplestform the MPI will be worn by a marine, soldier, or sailor in proximity to his/her garment and used to periodically check the efficacy of the garment.  The MPI concept is based on previous Scentczar work for the Du Pont Corporation and most recently thephase I program in which a simple dye-substrate system was shown to respond to military environmental chemicals which load the activated carbon in protective garments.  Phase II will: 1) develop an automated system for manufacturing MPI badges, 2) developan entire military system around the badge, 3) test the system in a formal test program including performance testing and environmental testing, 4) demonstrate the MPI system in a military scenario, and 5) get the system ready for mass production.  Themarket for the MPI system is very large.  For example there were over one million gas masks manufactured in the past decade which could use the system.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         We propose to develop a compact, robust differential absorption lidar (DIAL) for water vapor profiling from an unpiloted aeronautical vehicle (UAV) platform. The key to the innovation of this UAV DIAL is in a small, high performance, diode pumped Cr:LiSAF laser tunable in 830nm range. In a compact and low power consumption configuration, this laser will provide a narrow linewidth and stable 20mJ laser pulses at a high PRF up to 100Hz. These laser characteristics: moderate energy and high PRF are very well suited for high altitude (20km) UAV flights. The novel digital lidar design approach using a moderate laser pulse energy with high PRF allows the laser system to be very compact and robust for ease of deployment on the UAV, while maintaining a lidar performance equal to that of the conventional DIAL system. In Phase I, a breadboard laser with all proposed attributes will be developed and the performance will be demonstrated in the laboratory. A comprehensive design of the lidar system integrated with the laser, will also be performed to meet the UAV operational requirements. SESI's expertise in DIAL design and extensive experience will be directly applied for designing an autonomous system to be produced in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant): High dose chemotherapy is now a commonly        used approach for treatment of hematologic and other cancers, but causes severe      myelosuppression requiring progenitor cell infusions. Purging cancer cells from      infusions, while maintaining progenitor cells, is an important goal in               optimizing the curative potential of this technology. Current purging                techniques have limited efficiency and demand intensive time, technology and         cost. We have demonstrated a new technology that selectively kills larger cells      (including tumor cells) while preserving or enriching hematopoietic progenitor       cells, and does so rapidly, profoundly and inexpensively. In phase II, we will       apply this technology to a relevant hematologic cancer model (multiple               myeloma). Process parameters will be refined to achieve complete tumor purging       and progenitor cell preservation/enrichment from tumor-seeded blood or cord          blood cells. Sensitive and accurate cell enumeration will be achieved through        flow cytometry, tumor regrowth assays, real-time PCR, progenitor cell                quieseence/pluripotency assays, and in vivo hematopoietic reconstitution and         malignancy assessment in NOD/SCIDt,B2m about mice. We will then apply refined        parameters and assessment techniques to clinical volumes of bone marrow cells        from myeloma patients, utilizing an optimized, clinical-scale flowing process        apparatus. We anticipate the Phase III effort will involve Phase II clinical         trials supported by a major biomedical partner.       PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: We expect PEF cell-size specific inactivation technology to be an effective transplant tissue purging strategy for post-intensive-therapy patient support. With the propose refinements and assessments, it should provide an approach for rapid, cost-effective, high purity isolation of stem cells from progenitor cell preparations, which will open research, clinical, gene therapy and stem cell banking markets. Our market analysis indicates that the total revenues for this technology may eventually reach $100 million per year.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This proposal responds to a key challenge faced by the U.S. Army in fielding L-band HPM devices: the need for a high peak-power (>100 MW), pencil-beam (G ~ 30 dB) antenna, which is also lightweight (< 250 kg), rapidly-steerable, and compact enough to bedeployed on a standard Army land vehicle or air platform.  During Phase I, SARA applied a powerful combination of analytical, numerical, and experimental tools to simulate and/or measure the electromagnetic behavior of all the key components of ourproposed approach. We performed in-depth assessments of gain, power-handling, steerability, bandwidth, polarization, and more.  This work led to improvements in our initial parameter choices, resulting in higher gain, greater compactness, and greaterefficiency.  Our conclusion is clear: we can definitely meet the Army's requirements for a practical, deployable, compact, lightweight, rapidly-steerable, high-gain, L-band HPM antenna.  In Phase II, SARA will construct two prototype antennas forexperimental pattern characterizations and high-power tests, the latter to be performed with an ARL-supplied HPM source. The resulting data, in concert with more sophisticated numerical modeling and analyses, should drive additional improvements.  Themechanical support structure and steering/folding mechanisms will be engineered with a strong emphasis on suitability to tactical field applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Despite years of R&D;, most methods of ocean wave energyconversion (OWEC) are still indirect, bulky, expensive, andmechanically-inefficient. This is not due to bad engineering.The problem is mechanical impedance matching; ocean waves offerup their power as very strong forces (10's of tons) acting atvery low velocities (< 1 m/s). To couple this power toconventional high-speed rotary electric generators, inefficientmechanisms such as spin-up gearboxes or airpressurization/turbine systems are needed. In contrast, SARA'sapproach replaces those elements with a direct-conversionmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generator.  The impedance-matchingburden is shifted from the mechanical to the electrical domain,where the high currents and low voltages generated via MHD mustbe converted to practical levels.  Fortunately, this can be donewith modern electronic switches and transformers. The result isefficient, compact, economical, and deployable.  During Phase I,we designed, built, and tested a small-scale liquid-metal MHDgenerator and solid-state power converter, generating 100's ofwatts at 115V AC and solidly validating the principles ofoperation.  For Phase II, we propose to design, build, and testan even more efficient MHD device capable of generating up to 100kW, paving the way to transition this technology to real-worldOWEC applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Nonlinear optical (NLO) materials play a critical role in current solid-state laser systems enabling broad tunability and operation at wavelengths not accessible by available laser gain media. At the same time, NLO materials limit the longevity and efficiency of these laser systems due to low damage thresholds, poor optical quality and small nonlinearities. As a result, new NLO materials are required to improve the performance of existing systems and to provide new combinations of optical and mechanical properties that yield new wavelengths. Specifically, there is a need for new/better NLO materials for use in high efficiency all solid-state lasers operating in the UV. Borate crystals, including BBO and LBO, are currently two of the industry standards for this application. A new material, lithium borogermanate (LBG), has the potential to replace these materials with increased transmission in the UV combined with larger nonlinearities. Based on preliminary characterization results, crystalline structure, and composition, LBG has the potential to enable new devices that require operation deeper in the UV. This Phase I SBIR project is aimed at developing hydrothermal growth systems for this new NLO material. This project will use unique, resealable, hydrothermal growth equipment capable of precise control and in-situ monitoring of growth conditions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The battlefield of the future will be a `digital battlefield' - a place dominated by unmanned air, land, and sea combat vehicles, precision guided smart weapons, and real-time networked communications.  The unmanned vehicle, whether operating on air, land,or sea provides force multiplication, lower costs, and reduced risk of casualties.  As they exist today, the miniature autonomous munitions act independently to locate and attack the target.  Their performance could be greatly enhanced by allowing groupsof munitions to share information and coordinate activities.  Scientific Research Corporation (SRC) proposes to build and test a communication architecture for the Submunition vehicles that is based on the industry standard Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum(DSSS) chip-sets that re used heavily in unlicensed ISM band applications.  Implementing a network radio using the DSSS approach is low-cost and rugged due to the commercial chip-set implementation and is relatively compact.  However, the performance levelrequired for this application is not available with any commercial WLAN product.  In contrast to commercial WLAN products, SRC is proposing to surround the core DSSS chip-set with numerous enhancements to the design to dramatically improve range andperformance.  Rather than a maximum open-air range of 1000 feet, SRC's design will have a range of 4-6 miles.  The network will use novel routing protocols that accommodate rapidly changing multi-hop path, and self-forming network as opposed to the typicalWLAN implementation where nodes are attached to a given access point and specific server found in the office network scenario.",

It also covers other important IA issues such as network reliability, network availability, long-termmaintainability, and the integration with the DoD's strategic backbones and tactical Intranets.  Finally, SRC's modular open system architecture is based on industry standards, uses common hardware and software, and also provides a dynamically-configurablemicrosensor network with improved information assurance that can continuously evolve as new technologies emerge.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Not Available This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the traditional size limit of the Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) input aperture. This limit (approximately 8-inches) is imposed by (1) practical fabrication limits to the size of glass flats that can be polished to a surface figure of lambda/100 and (2) by cost limitations. Although an array of smaller glass plates might be used to expand the collecting area of the FPI, coordination of spectral scans over the array elements requires unwieldy control systems or else is not possible with conventional barometric or piezo-electric FRI systems. This research establishes arrays of innovative FPI etalons that use liquid crystal (LC) in the FPI resonant cavity. Spectral scanning of these devices is accomplished by application of a low current to conducting layers applied to the glass substrates. The electric field imposed upon liquid crystal in the resonant cavity alters the orientation of the LC, and thus the index of refraction of the material in the resonant cavity. The ease of electronic control over the refractive index in the FPI cavity permits simple, low weight, low power coordination of multiple LC filled cells and thus makes possible a large array of FPI cells, scanning a spectrum in unison. Phase II will design and fabricate two 10-inch diameter arrays of LC FPI (LCFP) filters. One array will be configured for Doppler measurements of atmospheric emissions and the other for 0.16-nanometer spectral resolution. Potential commercial applications are expected in (1) atmospheric lidar, (2) space-based environmental sensing, (3) passive airglow sensing, (4) clear-air turbulence detection, and (5) target detection",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Reliable Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR) techniques exist for many different sensors. The effectiveness of each technique is limited due to restrictions placed on the target characteristics.  We propose algorithms that fuse target ID informationfrom different NCTR sources in order to improve the overall NCTR performance regardless of the target  characteristics. During the Phase I effort,  we developed and tested several fusion approaches on simulated data.  Without utilizing informationregarding the quality of the individual NCTR technique,  the results indicated that the superiority of the FUSION technique (e.g., Bayes) is prominent for data of good quality, whereas for  data of poor quality,  training or pre-processing (e.g., confusionmatrix, correlation) is more important. Incorporating training, estimation, and information regarding the quality of the individual NCTR technique renders the Correlation and Confusion Matrix methods the best, followed by the Dempster's Rule Fuser. Theprimary focus of the Phase II will be to design and develop a prototype software system consisting of robust multisource data fusion and NCTR algorithms.  The emphasis will be on further  prototype development and demonstration of  the data fusiontechniques implemented in  Phase I. Additional fusion approaches including the Fuzzy Modified Dempster's approach  will also be developed under this effort. This Phase II development will be based on testing against REAL DATA with target identificationinformation from multiple NCTR techniques.  The project team includes Dr. Ronald Mahler of Lockheed Martin, who will provide both technical and commercialization support.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The  Air Force is interested in critical technologies that will support beam control systems on airborne or space based high energy laser (HEL) weapons platforms used to engage both clear targets  and targets that are viewed against background clutter.These include stationary and moving targets, tracking and adaptive optics using passive and active compensation, and fire control functions that include target acquisition and identification, and aimpoint selection. Air Force missions that are relevant tothis effort include Airborne Laser (ABL) main and adjunct missions, Tactical HEL Fighter (THELF) missions, applications of the Space Based Laser (SBL) and Relay Missions against ground and airborne targets, Airborne Tactical Laser (ATL) and Laser Gunshipmissions. During the course of this project, Scientific Systems Company Inc. (SSCI) and its partner Lockheed Martin-Eagan (LM-E), will address three objectives in support of these critical technologies. They are: 1) Fine Tracking in High ScintillationEnvironments (atmosphere distortion compensation), 2) Detection and Tracking of Ground Targets in Heavy Clutter Environments (track-before-detect techniques), 3) Test and Evaluation at AFRL/DEBA sites, the Advanced Concept Lab, MIT/LL, or other sponsoredsites and the transition of these technologies into AF missions. Scientific Systems has teamed up with Lockheed-Martin, Eagan for this project, and they will provide both technical and  commercialization support. SSCI and LM-E have a strong background inthe areas of image analysis, pattern recognition and target tracking with applications to areas such as detection, tracking, and estimation in high clutter environments. These techniques are mathematically rigorous and are formulated within a recursiveBayesian nonlinear filtering approach to optimally exploit all available a priori information.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The proliferation and effectiveness of Distributed Mission Training (DMT) systems is dependent upon the life cycle cost/benefit ratio of such training systems. Unfortunately, long-standing problems associated with wide field-of-view visual displays forground-based simulator-training applications--to include poor resolution, poor intensity (i.e., luminosity), and high costs-have significantly affected the fielding of DMT training capabilities to date. Display resolution problems are being addressedthrough current Air Force efforts to develop color imaging systems with greater than 5120 x 4096, non-interlaced pixel resolutions at reasonable prices. The proposed Phase II AAcuity20/20-HD (Hyper-Drive) PC-IG Array efforts focus on developing theinterface module for driving such displays. Phase II concentrates on interfacing high-resolution projectors that present out-the-window imagery in high-performance flight trainers for DMT and other display applications. The AAcuity20/20-HD design supportsthe Air Force's capitalization of the rapidly developing PC-based graphics market to provide imagery for these systems. These innovations, founded on PC-based technology, will be capable of presenting 5120 x 4096, 60 HZ, non-interlaced video providing alarge, scalable virtual-screen Hyper-buffer that can be read and written to simultaneously by multiple parallel devices. Scalability and Upgradeability are built-in features of the modular distributed architecture design of the AAcuity20/20-HD(Hyper-Drive) PC-IG Array.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The Small Airport Automation System (SAASY) provides cost-effective traffic separation and sequencing advisories for general aviation pilots operating at small airports that do not have air traffic control (ATC) towers. SAASY will enable significant increases in runway and airspace safety, and in the pilots perception of safety. SAASY is an automated airport-based decision support tool that uses aircraft position and velocity to deduce pilot intent, determines safe separation minimums and landing / takeoff sequences, and communicates this information to pilots via data link. Pilots will use the information to set up and control their landing and takeoff paths so that they are both safe and expeditious. SAASY technology may also provide improved capacity at the smaller airports, both for those with and without ATC towers. This technology could also be used to support air carrier operations, ground defense operations in regions without towered runways, commercial rotorcraft operations at vertiports (e.g., at off-shore oil rigs), and special landing strip operations by commercial and government entities such as overnight express package delivery, fire fighting, and drug interdiction. This innovation will assist NASA in achieving its objectives of improving national airport safety and capacity.",

The research established in Phase I the feasibility of today's sensors, communications and computers to implement Human-Aiding Technology (HAT) for aerial supervisory personnel. HAT can greatly enhance firefighter situational awareness by creating a \"shared mental model\" among distributed personnel, thereby reducing miscommunications, automating routine communication tasks, reducing workload, and increasing firefighter safety. The proposed Phase II research implements the candidate airborne supervisory HAT displays and input devices identified in Phase I in the context of a simulation-based laboratory. This laboratory environment can be used to host and evaluate HAT devices, synthesize integrated displays, conduct crew resource management and workload studies, and eventually serve as a training system for aerial supervisory personnel and tactical pilots. Phase II will culminate in a demonstration and evaluation periods where the User community (aerial supervisors, safety officers, tactical pilots) will be invited to validate the candidate integrated HAT displays and controls in the simulated environment.",

The SeiraD approach is based on research conducted by Dr. Joe Gatewood while at Los Alamos National Laboratory.  Dr. Gatewood and colleaguesdeveloped the nanotechnology that provides the foundation for the SeiraD approach.  During the Phase I effort, SeiraD focused on producing DNA-sized pores and developing nanolithography techniques.  The pore production capability advanced to the pointwhere generation of DNA sized pores is possible.  40A clusters as well as 200A squares of metal have been removed from a metal-coated silicon surface using nanolithography.  The techniques developed during Phase I will be refined and utilized to constructa prototype DNA sequencing instrument during Phase II.  Experiments to reduce the metal cluster size and software modifications will improve nonolithography resolution.  The device will be incorporated into a DNA sequencing cell.  Sensitive electronicswill be utilized to sample the probe DNA sequence data.  Data from the sequencing cell will be provided to DARPA.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The application's objective is completion       of the design, coding and marketing of the AskAnywhere web-based survey system.      The system consists of three components: a questionnaire editing application, a      client-side data collection applet, and a communication and data processing          server program. These three components work on all computers running Java            Virtual Machines. The questionnaire editing application has a straightforward        graphical user interface easing the design and editing of complex, WYSIWYG           questionnaires. The questionnaire editor simplifies the \"programming\" of             questionnaires, which include complex skips, dynamic calculations and embedded       fills in the wording of questions and responses. Questionnaires can be written       in any modern language since all files are stored as Unicode. The survey             engine, a Java applet downloaded to the respondent's machine at the time of the      survey, offers both respondents and survey administrators a secure, robust           protocol for web-based data collection. The web-server program offers session        tracking, data decryption, maintains real-time links between the questionnaire       and a JDBC compliant database and offers automatic statistical analysis and          charting via the web. To further assist social and health scientists, and            survey researchers everywhere, a bank of widely used questions and                   questionnaires will be compiled and integrated. The editor will import and           export questionnaire files in a wide variety of cross-application formats.           PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  Social and health scientists, educators and market researchers seeking powerful surveying  tools capable writing and importing questionnaires from a variety of sources will be attracted  to AskAnywhere's editing options, questionnaire ecumenicity, and multilingual capabilities.  Market analyst and corporate survey researchers will appreciate AskAnywhere's multi-tier,  highly scalable design in which corporate legacy databases can be incorporated into data  collection efforts.",

Innovations include miniaturization of the individual InGaAs p-i-n photodiodes, minimization of the spacing between the photodiodes in the array, development of corresponding indium bump technology, and use of large (75 mm -100 mm diameter) epitaxial wafers. During Phase I, we reduced the pixel geometry from 24 m to 11 m, a 5x reduction in total device area.  During Phase II, we will  produce a full 1280x1024 array on 75 mm and 100 mm diameter epitaxial wafers.

It is required for testing to compare measurements with modeling predictions as well as to monitor flexing and vibration under load.  Presently, there are only a limitednumber f methods to measure strains that are suitable for embedding in a composite material and all are either expensive or complex.  This proposal is for development and application of a new and novel strain sensor consisting of a small diameter wirecoated with a magnetic film.  The magnetic film dominated the impedance of the overall system cost is low with a potential cost advantage over fiber optic sensors or a factor of 100.  The technology of the magnetic sensor make it suitable to obtain curinginformation of a composite.  Additionally, it can be used to obtain information on external strain throughout the life of the material.  Since the system can be used in a modified array structure, the stain at different points can be measured versus time,giving information on the vibration of the structure, including modal analysis.  This proposal addresses one specific application of a new technology, a magnetic sensor for embedding in composites to monitor internal strain, booth during manufacture andthroughout the composite life cycle.  Such sensors can be used to monitor the health of advanced composites used for airframes and space applications, as well as more conventional structures such as buildings, bridges, etc.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Unedited Applicant's Abstract): The development of an                   ultra-miniature optical pressure sensor is proposed for NHLBI's research             topics: Heart and Vascular Diseases, Biosensors. Intended for intravascular          use, the sensor must be disposable and, therefore, will be designed to be            available at a reasonable cost for clinical use. The small size of the sensor        and the flexibility of the optical fibers will result in a pressure transducer,      which can be inserted into blood vessels (arteries, veins, or heart chamber)         with an angioplasty guide wire with a diameter of only 0.3 mm. The sensor can        measure blood pressures in the range of 0 to 300 mmHg with both diastolic and        systolic blood pressures. The sensor will operate over time periods of up to a       few days without periodic re-calibration. Its pressure readings will be              independent of temperature changes in the range of 20 degreesC - 50 degreesC.                                                                                             The primary commercial application of this device will be for angioplasty            treatment. Because of its small size, the sensor can be used for infants and         also to monitor fluid pressures in the human brain after surgery. The low cost       will allow it to be used for small animal research. The Phase I effort               demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed approach. Prototype development         will be carried out in Phase II.   PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Not Available",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Shape Change Technologies, LLC proposes to deliver engineering designs for a prototypical smart self-repairing cryo-fluid seal for remote applications, such as deep space, lunar or planetary environments, such as on Mars. The seal utilizes new material solutions of cryogenically compatible elastomers and discrete smart actuation materials to provide a seal surface which can be shielded from debris, allow for shape recovery after being compressed from sealing or from local damage. The concept includes a smart shroud to protect the cryocoupling and seal from debris. This elastomeric shroud serves as a reusable, low power, retrofittable secondary seal with embedded sensors for leak detection. The technology scales with size, so both small and large cryo- seal applications are accessible with this technology.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION: (Applicant's Description)                                                                                                                                    The overall goal of this project is to develop a commercially viable bacterial       toxin-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) fusion protein for selective         targeting of endothelial cells at sites of angiogenesis, primarily in solid          tumors and growing metastases.  VEGF interacts with the endothelial cell             specific KDR/flk-1 receptor that is overexpressed in endothelial cells at the        sites of angiogenesis relative to its expression on quiescent endothelium.                                                                                                In Phase I of this project we have constructed, expressed and purified two           novel fusion proteins, SLT-VEGF/L and SLT-VEGF/S which contain, respectively,        The A subunit of Shiga-like toxin I (SLT) and a functionally active fragment         of the A subunit.  SLT causes hemorrhagic                                            colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome by damaging endothelial cells suggesting       that endothelial cells are particularly sensitive to SLT .                                                                                                                SLT-VEGF/L and SLT-VEGF/S proteins selectively inhibit growth of endothelial         cells overexpressing KDR/flk-1 receptors with IC-50 of 0.15 nM.  At low              nanomolar concentrations SLT-VEGF/L is cytotoxic for endothelial cells               overexpressing KDR/flk-l receptors.  However, these proteins do not affect           growing endothelial cells with low numbers of KDR/flk-l receptors, quiescent         endothelial cells, and growing non-endothelial cells.  These results provide a       rationale for Phase II in vivo testing of SLT-VEGF fusion proteins as highly         selective inhibitors of angiogenesis.  We will also test whether SLT-VEGF            proteins may synergize with other antitumor drugs by enhancing delivery              through damaged tumor endothelium or by creating hypoxic conditions for              bioreductive therapeutics.  Finally, we will optimize SLT-VEGF fusion proteins       to achieve high levels of expression, activity, and stability that are               necessary for preclinical and clinical trials.       PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: A brief summary of the potential commercial applications of the research: VEGF-toxin fusion proteins that inhibit angiogenesis but do not affect normal endothelium or normal cells will be commercial products for therapy of angioaenesis-dependent pathologies.",

This non-electrical system is a simple means for ensuring and maintaining a good socket fit, with security and stability increased over the state of the art. Poorly fitting sockets, which cause pain and skin lesions, are responsible for a significant portion of TTAs rejecting a prosthesis. The SVGS/TT utilizes suction retention, which provides an important benefit, particularly to diabetics, by increasing blood circulation in the residual limb. The unique SVGS system consists of multiple, liquid-filled bladders placed by the prosthetist during socket fitting and a control for maintaining appropriate pressures on the residual limb at selected locations, all contained within the dimensions of a conventional prosthesis. The SVGS can be applied by the prosthetist with existing equipment and conventional art, thereby minimizing implementation cost. This attribute will enhance market acceptance. Phase I demonstrated feasibility; Phase II will measure efficacy and acceptance by TTAs. Phase II results will be the catalyst for successful commercialization.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Fueled by the need for wireless and broadband communications, the number of channels available to accommodate this rapidly growing traffic is reaching its saturation state. A logical solution is to squeeze channel spacing and communicate at much higherfrequencies. Yet, it is beyond our technical limits to produce the most basic component - an ultra-stable piezoelectric resonator, capable of performing at the Gigahertz range with minimum drift characteristics. Under the Phase I effort, we havedemonstrated the feasibility of our Laser Ultrasonic/Optical Stimulus Technology capable of characterizing these resonators throughout its fabrication process. Our Phase II objectives are to expand, implement and commercialize this high speed, non-contacttechnology to control the fundamental parameters that guarantee the production of these ultra-stable, high frequency resonators.Support towards our proposed Phase II effort includes Strong Endorsement from the Sensors & Electron Device Directorate, Army Research Laboratory, Adelphi, MD; $200K (cash) Mission Fund commitment from the Army's Frequency Control Program; $283K (cash)matching fund via the State of California (CalTIP Program); and $209K (in-kind) matching fund from various semiconductor and solar cell industries. These matching fund commitments will make us eligible for Army's Phase II Plus pilot program, which we willapply through ARL's SBIR Office",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The principal objective of this proposal is to transform the SST CRIS (Crop Reflectance Imaging System) from a prototype, whose feasibility has been demonstrated during the Phase I research, to a turnkey, user friendly unit that can be operated by only the pilot of a small aircraft, or by ground operator when carried by a UAV. The images produced by the system are True Reflectance, e.g. they contain properties of the cropped target field only and not a radiance image containing properties of the illumination source and the reflectance properties of the crop target. The emphasis in this research project will be: 1) on the engineering required to improve the three CCD, single lens digital camera and radiometers so that they can be operated by a single operator, 2) on the development of the user friendly software required to control the hardware units and to transform the digital number images into true reflectance images of the single bands, the color IR reflectance composite, and images of various indices derived from true reflectance (NDVI, etc.) representing the crop conditions and 3) on research to establish the environmental and operational conditions under which the acquisition of meaningful data may be expected.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The area of innovation of this proposal is in cost. We propose to attempt the design of an extremely low-cost spacecraft control and pointing system with, nontheless, high quality pointing accuracy and stability perhaps as good as a few arcseconds. Further we will attempt to design this GN&C; system in a way that can be easily adopted by technical communities with small amounts of aerospace infrastructure. The innovative elements of the design, that will lead to a low cost product, come from system engineering design and software design. This innovation is important to NASA in that it will enable the participation of the University community in the space program in a very substantial way. Currently University-class investigators are limited, at best, to supplying an instrument to a government or commercial spacecraft. With this innovation in place, University researchers will have their own access to space with their own spacecraft through NASA's launch programs (e.g. Shuttle HitchHiker and Bantam). This proposal meets affordability, reduced cost, and reduced complexity requirements from section 12.08 of the solicitation.",

In the Phase I effort and through related programs, SMI has demonstrated  that MOCVD is capable of producing the request thin complex oxide film structures.Raytheon manufactures functional  bulk based pyroelectric detectors and imaging arrays and has demonstrated manufactures functional bulk based pyroelectric detectors and imaging arrays and has demonstrated the potential of a competely integrated thin filmimaging device (IC circuitry, pyroelectric detector, module packaging, readout electronics, and so on). In Phase II we will pool our technologies to produce functional imaging arrays and detectors with significantly improved device performance.  The PhaseIII result of the project will be economical production of superior non-cryogenically cooled pyroelectric devices, which can be retrofitted as an upgrade into existing product lines as well as forward integrated into known and anticipated low ans high endcommercial and lilitary products.  SMI will achieve and commercialize the materials/process technology and certain devices and our matching fund partner, Raytheon, wil market and field IR device products.l  Revolutionary improvements in cost andperformance of non-cryogenically cooled IR imaging imaging arrays and detectors that can retrofit existing product lines and forward integrate-- will enhance or enable a host of night vision monitoring and transportation applications.

A continuously-updated, comprehensive            database of self-report studies with related criterion validities addresses          these problems, has clear policy implications, and positive market potential.        Staff surpassed Aims during Phase I, locating 6,500 references and 274 physical      articles. These included 152 empirical reports comparing self-reports of drug,       alcohol or tobacco use with a biological measure of use or collateral reports.       A coding system and a pilot database had approximately 60 variables by which to      characterize studies and observations. Staff coded 80 studies containing 221         comparisons of self-reports with biological or collateral reports. A                 demonstration meta-analysis was conducted for opiate/heroin and cocaine/crack        comparing self-reports with urinalysis; staff present six typical statistical        measures of concordance. During Phase II, over 15 major databases will be            searched, over 2000 relevant citations retrieved, and over 1000 articles will        be collected and coded following rigorous criteria. A meta-analysis will be          provided in the final report. These databases and meta-analysis capabilities         will be developed into a website, and sold to different consumers, purchased on      CD-ROM or purchased as a manual on how to maximize self-report or when               biological validation is needed.

Asover fifty years of research in human vigilance and attention hasshown, humans are not well-suited to maintaining alertness andattention under monotonous conditions. As the world's largestemployer of shift-work personnel, the Navy/Marine corps isparticularlyvulnerable to circadian fatigue/alertness challenges and thus isin a position to receive the most benefit from our research anddevelopment results.During Phase I, we have successfully demonstrated thefeasibility of using state-of-the-art, preparation-free dryEEG electrodes to  accurately track behaviorally definedchanges in drowsiness, and have also demonstrated thefeasibility of using video-based eye tracking to extractfatigure-related changes in eyeblink characteristics.We have also identified a target application for initial productdevelopment, vehicle operations, have demonstrated thefeasibility ofaccurately estimating changes in driving performance during arealisticdriving task. Further, we have secured a support agreement from acommercial sponsor, DENSO Corporation, a world-leading automotivecomponent manufacturer, which has agreed to provide matchingsupportfor our Phase II/III research, prototype development and fieldtesting. Based on these promising results and achievements, weareconfident that our envisioned alertness monitoring system istechnically feasible and has realistic prospects for near-termcommercial and military application.",

This binder characterization effort has provided with a down-selection approach that will be used in Phase II to select the most appropriate binder.The selection of the optimum binders will be based on an extensive mechanical and ballistic testing program of preforms made with binders that have: a) compatible, b) incompatible and c) hybrid behavior with the resin system at different binder weightconcentrations. The results will provide the necessary information for the design of two preform systems.The first one is a short-term, superior and optimized preform for the Mantech efforts that will offer equivalent ballistic performance to ones made currently. This will be available for demonstration and implementation on current Army combat vehicle designprograms such as the Crusader.The second one will entail the creation of an optimized armor system with graded properties through the preform thickness that will improve performance and reduce weight while still using affordable preforming. This technology will become available toinsert in future Army combat vehicles.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant): This research plan is to develop a              Microcarrier-Bioreactor Cell Culture System for the growth and efficient             recovery of infected, whole cells from microcarriers in controlled, bioreactor       cultures. Primary chick embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells are widely used in viral       vaccine production (for both avian and human vaccines), but there are no known       licensed-manufacturing protocols which utilize a Microcarrier-Bioreactor System      for this purpose. Focus will be on the production of a whole cell Marek's            Disease vaccine for avian applications. The System technology developed in the       course of these studies could replace large-scale industrial processes in which      (1) primary CEF cells are utilized in roller bottles, (2) embryonated, fertile       eggs function as tiny bioreactors, such as in the manufacturing of human             influenza vaccine or (3) whole cell vaccines and/or immunotherapies.                                                                                                      Specific Aims I, II and VI. To optimize cell culture conditions for a one to         two day HVT-production run using primary CEF cells, secondary CEF cells and          immortalized CEF-like cells at high density, in a one-liter bioreactor culture.                                                                                           Specific Aim III. To optimize culture conditions for a three-day HVT-production      run using secondary CEF cells at the one-liter scale in bioreactor culture.                                                                                               Specific Aim IV & V. To develop protocols for rapid harvesting of HVT-infected       cells, and separation of those cells from microcarriers, and to achieve              high-titer Marek's vaccine production.    PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Many animal vital vaccines (e.g. Marek's) and human viral vaccines are produced  using chick embryo cells, either in roller bottle systems or in embryonated chicken  eggs. Neither process uses microcarrier - bioreactor systems. Large scale  production of Marek's vaccine in a Miaocarrier-Bioreactor System, will lead to  substantial economic advantages when bioreactors are compared to old technology.  Product quality and consistency should also be improved. and manufacturing costs  reduced. The System herein proposed will utilize (1) primary or secondary CEF  cells, or immortalized cell lines. (2) special media formulations, (3) bovine sera  and will evolve the (4) protocols to produce vaccines in this System. The  technology should extrapolate to other whole-cell human vaccines.     PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The current short supply of human influenza vaccine serves to underline the  importance for developing technology that is an alternative to embryonated egg  production methods. The lead time from (1) a CDC estimate of the specific influenza  virus variant likely to strike the USA, to (2) the availability of the vaccine on a large  scale is exceedingly long, many months. In the event of an influenza pandemic  this many-month lead-time could result in a high fatality rate reminiscent of the  1917-18 pandemic. If influenza virus vaccine can be produced in very large-scale  bioreactors, with a fast turn around time (a couple months), the high fatality rate of  a pandemic might be averted. The research proposed has the potential to address  this issue.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA-based technologies have become              increasingly prominent in research and biotechnology since the discovery of          catalytic RNA (ribozymes), techniques for selection of novel functions from          random libraries of RNA, and the widespread use of microarrays. However, the         cost of producing RNA by synthetic or enzymatic means remains high-at least ten      times the cost of DNA, and synthetic methods are limited to short RNAs. This         proposal describes a novel method for the low-cost, largescale production of         custom RNA products of any length based on amplification in plants using viral       vectors, an approach that has been successfully used for the production of           protein products. After infection with recombinant virus, the plants are             harvested, virions are isolated using an established, single-step procedure,         RNA is extracted, and the desired fragment is excised and purified in a simple       procedure. Yields of viral RNA are approximately 0.5 percent of total dry plant      mass. In Phase I of this project we established proof of principle by                demonstrating the insertion of a custom RNA fragment into the viral RNA vector,      which remained completely stable and intact under normal storage and in vivo         conditions. Upon addition of a new solution component, the insert was                efficiently excised from the vector. In Phase II, we will develop this approach      into a practical method ready for commercialization. This will involve a series      of optimizations to make the system robust enough to overcome any obstacles          that may emerge for certain custom RNAs. Our first demonstration of large-scale      RNA production from plants will be to several hundred milligrams of a candidate      therapeutic ribozyme and a key element of the hepatitis C virus.   PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: RNA is an important target for structural biology and biomedical studied including HIV  and influenza viruses. It also has potential in antisense and ribozyme therapeutics,  biotechnology products and molecular biology tools: Our technology would provide  large amounts of custom RNAs less expensively and more efficiently than alternative  methods. Our current business strategy is to sell custom RNA in partnership with  Large Scale Biology Corp. and license the technology to certain other manufacturers.",

This prototype will demonstrate the potential for low-cost simulations to be integratedinto training environments.  The training audience for the CATSS prototype would range from deployed high-level Naval staff officers to Marine expeditionary force commanders.  The intended CATSS simulation exercise begins with ship commanders and staffofficers planning amphibious operations and ends with tactical engagements on land, with the appropriate naval, ground and air assets represented.  This system could also be used to support rehearsal of proposed plans in preparation for real-worldoperations.  The basic framework for this prototype simulation system will be to integrate two existing simulations, namely, MAGTF XXI and Jane's Fleet CommandT using a high level architecture ( HLA) interface.  Specific tasks will include: developing theHLA-simulation system architecture, developing simulation system data structures, incorporating associated primary software components with simulation system, installation of the CATSS prototype onboard a deploying LHA/LHD for evaluation, and researchingthe requirements to transition the CATSS prototype to a development system.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The results of the Phase I project increase the likelihood that the project's new technology will make a major contribution to a healthier world environment. First, the U.S. EPA is introducing mercury-control standards on power plants requiring significant emission reductions from over 1,000 utility coal-fired boilers. A regulatory timetable has now been set, which will lead to the installation of mercury control technologies on these units. Second, an analysis of the measurements supplied in response to EPA's mercury Information Collection Request reveals that the biggest part of the U.S. utility problem is the emission of the elemental form of mercury, which current controls do not capture. During the Phase I project, two discoveries were made that help demonstrate the feasibility of Sorbent Technologies' new duct-injection sorbent approach. First, the new elemental-mercury sorbents were found to work through a chemisorption process. Project experiments showed this to be responsible for high sorbent stability and surprisingly good high-temperature performance. Powdered activated carbons (PACs), the best sorbents currently available, capture mercury primarily through a weak physical adsorption. In fixed-bed experiments at representative utility flue-gas temperatures, the new sorbents demonstrated elemental-mercury capacities ten (10) times higher than typical PACs. With the new technology, it may be possible to achieve net mercury-removal costs that are one-tenth that of current technologies. The second discovery was that the sorbents can be made from commercially available substrate many times smaller than PACs. This would relieve the bulk-gas mass-transfer limitations that many believe inherently constrain PACs from achieving high performance under economical conditions.",

The process for preparing acrylate and/or methacrylate monomers derived from castor oil and other industrial oils, such as soybean and linseed oils, involves an acrylate derivatization step. Monomers based on castor oil have been incorporated into latex polymers by emulsion polymerization to form latex polymers suitable for use in self-coalescing and self- crosslinking architectural latex paints. One interior, low VOC latex paint containing biobased monomers has been submitted to the Pentagon for qualification testing.Successful completion of the Phase II project would provide a source of non-toxic, bio-renewable monomers from a variety of oils, soybeans, linseed, dehydrated castor, etc., for markets previously dominated by unsaturated polyesters and alkyds that are now dominated by petroleum based latex products. Even more desirable, the industrial oil monomers have the potential of providing environmentally friendly paints for consumers and homeowners by utilizing the inherent ambient crosslinking attributes of naturally occurring unsaturated oils",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently available high throughput DNA         sequencing instruments achieve base calling by wavelength resolved,                  fluorescence detection of dye labeled fragments using a CCD camera.                  Identification of labels using fluorescence lifetimes is also possible. Because      cost effective, high speed, multichannel detectors are not available, adapting       lifetime detection to high throughput sequencing would seem to require               timesharing of a single element detection system between multiple                    electrophoresis channels. Southwest Sciences has developed a heterodyne              fluorescence lifetime method that is readily scalable to multi-element               detection. This approach uses simple, relatively low cost detection electronics      and a diode laser excitation source and will perform competitively with current      instrumentation at lower cost.                                                                                                                                            In Phase I, we successfully demonstrated the necessary time resolution,              sensitivity, and speed needed for DNA sequencing applications using a single         element detector and aqueous dye solutions. The Phase II effort will focus on        adapting this technique to capillary array sequencing. A single-capillary            instrument with an optimized heterodyne detector will be used to investigate         the base calling accuracy of this method in four-dye, single lane sequencing.        Analysis methods will be developed to call bases from the lifetime data.             Finally, a 16 element heterodyne detector, suitable for capillary arrays, will       be constructed and evaluated.    PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Automated DNA sequencing has application to genetic testing for medical diagnostics, agricultural and pharmaceutical applications. Our heterodyne approach to DNA base calling will significantly lower the cost of automated DNA sequencing instrumentation.",

Because the technique is optically based, no parasitic capacitance is added to the device being measured. A femtosecond laser probes the device to be measured, and temporal resolution is several orders of magnitude faster than the time resolution required to probe present devices.

Conventional smoke and gas detectors have a tendency for high false alarm rates, and worse, some gas detectors have a tendency not to alarm at dangerously high gas concentrations. Thus, Southwest Sciences proposes a novel, low-weight, and low-cost fire detection technology based on optical spectroscopy using Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs). Rapid, quantitative detection of part per million concentrations of multiple gases including carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen cyanide, and acetylene, and others are possible. In the proposed device, gas concentrations are measured separately, which greatly reduces the chances of a false alarm. The proposed instrument is self-calibrating and self-checking to reduce long term maintenance costs. The technology uses miniature LEDs and detectors that are rugged, low-weight, low-cost, and require little power. The Phase I effort will validate the proposed technology with measurements of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.",

Under microgravity conditions, flame ignition, propagation and extinction become simplified due to the lack of buoyancy. Quantitative monitoring of combustion species (reactants, products, intermediates) provides rigorous validation of combustion models and yield a better understanding of combustion. Many laboratory-based combustion diagnostics are not suited to use on microgravity platforms due to unique space and power constraints. We propose developing a new UV diode laser-based microgravity combustion diagnostic for quantitative detection of key combustion species. The instrument will allow absolute concentration measurement of key combustion species including trace radicals using a wide variety of microgravity combustion platforms including the Space Station. Our approach uses room temperature UV diode laser output directly, thereby keeping the instrument compact, rugged and energy efficient. The feasibility of the proposed technique will be demonstrated by quantitative measurement of CH radicals in laboratory flames. Further progress in fabrication technology of UV diode lasers for shorter wavelengths and higher power will result in measurement of species in deeper UV.",

Up to the present time the false-alarm rates for HSI sensors have been from one to three orders of magnitude too high for practical automatedwide-area HSI surveillance. The proposed work will take advantage of spectral signature information to discriminate high-value targets from natural and manmade anomalies. Specifically, we will refine the algorithms demonstrated under Phase I, program themto run in real time, and produce a deployable real-time processor which will demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of HSI surveillance systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Future synthetic aperture interferometric radiometers, such as JPL's New Millenium Program, Geostationary Synthetic Aperture Microwave Sounder (GEO/SAMS) instrument, will employ a thinned array of hundreds of miniaturized receivers and a massively parallel cross-correlator system for digital signal processing. The objectives of Phase I are to develop, fabricate, and test a proof-of-design of a 64-baseline, 1-bit encoding, cross-correlator chip operating at clock frequency of 120 MHz to provide the critical design information for the development in Phase II of a radiation-hard, 1024-baseline correlator chip and of an engineering model of a 16,384-baseline cross-correlator system dissipating less than 8 W. To achieve the stated objectives, the following synergistic combination of approaches will be used: a) innovative expandable architecture to enable the construction of cross-correlator systems with any number of antennas , b) new bit-systolic arrays for operation at high frequency with low power consumption, c) novel radiation-hard digital circuit techniques, and d) advanced sub-micron CMOS fabrication technologies. The cross-correlator chip proposed in this project, if successfully realized, will enable the implementation of low-power cross-correlator systems for spaceborne synthetic aperture interferometric radiometers that will be capable of performing breakthrough measurements of the Earth's environment.",

Current aircraft cloud particle measurements do not give good statistical data sets when compared to satellite overpasses. A new instrument, the cloud particle imager (CPI), previously developed under the SBIR program by SPEC, is now providing unique, high-resolution airborne digital images of cloud particles. A CPI that is configured for long-term measurements from a tethered balloon, or remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), such as the newly acquired NASA Proteus, can provide valid statistical comparisons. In Phase I, we will design a miniaturized, stand-alone CPI that can be operated for extended periods on a tethered balloon or an RPA. The balloon tether is heated so it can remain free of ice and stay aloft in clouds for days. In Phase II, we will build and test the miniature, stand-alone CPI on a research aircraft, RPA (if the NASA Proteus is available) and on the tethered balloon.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         60195     Climatological studies in both the Arctic and Antarctic show that global warming is having a dramatic effect on the rate of ice melt in polar regions.  Polar clouds appear to play a crucial role in contributing to the formation of melt ponds; however, long-term, in situ measurements of microphysical and radiative properties of polar clouds are not possible with research aircraft, due to their limited flight duration.  This project will develop a tethered balloon cloud particle imager (TBCPI) that is capable of operating for extended periods while recording high-definition digital images of cloud particles.  Phase I tested a tethered balloon system that is capable of making long-term in-situ microphysical and radiative measurements in polar clouds.  In addition, a TBCPI was designed that is capable of operating for extended periods while recording high-definition digital images of cloud particles.  In Phase II, the TBCPI will be built and integrated with a meteorology/radiation/position sensor package.  A demonstration field project will be conducted to collect meteorological, microphysical, and radiative data in wintertime stratus clouds using the tethered-balloon system.  These measurements will be compared with in-situ measurements made using a research aircraft.  The field program will demonstrate the ability of the tethered balloon system to collect long-term in-situ cloud data in conditions similar to those encountered in polar regions during summertime.                    Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: Stand-alone, tethered-balloon data collection stations could be deployed at several locations in high latitudes to collect statistically significant sets of microphysical and radiation data in clouds.  These measurements are needed in the Arctic by the DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program and by similar programs planned for the Antarctic.  A spin-off instrument that operates unattended in petroleum-fueled power plant stacks could provide considerable savings by monitoring effluent and adjusting fuel controllers",

The rates are generally not known and are difficult to measure, but are critical for meaningful simulations. Molecular Beam Experiments (MBE), which are typically used to determine them, produce large uncertainties in derived rates arising from uncertainties in the flow field of reacting molecules, and only cover a small portion of the parameter space of interest. We propose an analysis approach coupling fundamental computational chemistry tools to the SOCRATES Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) flow field code to provide an accurate simulation of MBEs. This will enable a much more accurate extraction of fundamental rates from MBE data and also allow the rate constant to be extrapolated with confidence to the entire application parameter space of interest. The Phase I technical objectives are: (1) Adapt SOCRATES to simulate MBEs, (2) Validate the approach using gas phase MBE data, and (3) Formulate a gas-surface computational chemistry-flow field model. The extension of the approach to model gas-surface MBE data is more complex and will be formulated in Phase I for implementation and experimental validation in Phase II.",

Currently, ambiguities inseparating temperature, emissivity and atmospheric effects complicate the detection and identification of targets against cluttered backgrounds, even using multiple wavelength bands.  To address this problem we developed and demonstrated in Phase I thefeasibility of a novel Short-wave/Infrared Fusion Technique (SIFT) for multispectral imagery, in which VIS-SWIR data (which may be from a prior collect and/or on a different platform) are used together with a physics-based temperature and emissivityretrieval algorithm to enhance the information content of TIR images. It enables retrieval of more accurate surface temperatures with minimal contamination from emissivity clutter and retrieval of more accurate spectral emissivities.  This will lead toimproved detection and identification of surface materials and objects. In Phase II, a refined SIFT will be coded into a versatile commercial prototype software package, dubbed the MSDA (Multi-Spectral Data Analysis) Toolkit, for data simulation, dataanalysis, and sensor trade studies, and used to analyze a variety of airborne and spaceborne data collects.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant): This project proposes the development of a      new technique for improving the performance of medical ultrasound systems using      microbubble-based contrast agents. The ultimate goal is the creation of an           \"excitation enhanced\" imaging system that will have a higher sensitivity than        current ultrasound scanners. Vascular contrast agents are capable of enhancing       the visibility of blood flow by several orders of magnitude. However their           performance is still not sufficient to reliably image perfusion and diagnose         conditions such as myocardial ischemia or infarction. The excitation enhanced        ultrasound modality utilizes two acoustic fields: onefor contrast agent              excitation and one for imaging. The excitation field temporarily increases the       number of contrast agent bubbles with a size close to resonance at the               frequency of the imaging field. If the imaging field is applied immediately          after the excitation burst, acoustic scattering from the excited bubbles is          markedly stronger than without the application of the excitation field. An in        vitro system was constructed as part of the Phase I effort and experiments           conducted using this system have demonstrated enhancements of up to 12dB. The        next step is to modify an ultrasound scanner to include the modality and to          validate the clinical potential of the technique with a series of in vivo            experiments.                                                                            PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Ultrasonic Imaging is now the second most widely used imaging modality after x-ray. It's usage has increased in recent years due to the development of ultrasonic specific contrast agents. The proposed research will accelerate the usefulness of contrast aganets for many significant clinical applications.",

This surpasses the resolution of commercial systems based on microfocus x-ray sources, and is 4-6 times better than current x-ray detectors. Based on these results it is anticipated that a resolution of 1-2 microns can be achieved in Phase II. If fully successful, the end result of Phase II will be a commercialized x-ray microscope with five to ten times the resolution of existing products. High-resolution x-ray imaging is used in many fields, including manufacturing, medicine, and scientific research. The product developed in Phase II will have better technical performance and be lower in cost that presently available systems.",

The Phase II will also have the capability to interoperate with othersoftware programs via a Common Object Rquest Broker Architecture (CORBA) interface.The Phase II product will consist of an integrated, tested, and documented user-friendly,Windows-based GUI for TERMAP.

The current state-of-the-art fabrication process for dual curvature (parabolic) shapes, developed by SRS Technologies, requires a single piece mandrel the size of the final membrane structure. SRS has fabricated precision thin film structures of up to 5 meters in diameter using this method. This technique could probably be extended to manufacture components up to approximately twice this size. However, new technology is required to fabricate very large membrane structures that are needed for many future NASA applications. This effort will result in development of a solvent welding technique to join film sections much more reliably and with much less variation in seam material properties than is achievable at this time. Additionally, new mandrel technology will be developed to enable larger films to be cast on lighter weight, less expensive tools.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This proposal describes an innovative two-stage SQUID-based amplifier and PC-based high-speed feedback electronics without flux modulation for low-impedance cryogenic detector readouts. The proposed amplifier consists of a sensitive input SQUID followed by a coherently modulated output SQUID array. The gain of the second stage is sufficient to allow the amplifier to be directly coupled to a room-temperature preamplifier, thereby eliminating the need for flux modulation and cooled impedance matching circuits and enabling wideband operation. The SQUIDs in the output array are damped to avoid resonances or distortions in the transfer characteristics, which improves the stability of the amplifier and simplifies operation, and enhances the large-signal bandwidth. All SQUID drive signals and loop parameters may be configured remotely via a Windows-based graphical user interface. Multi-channel configurations are supported. This effort directly benefits SEU programs and addresses specific needs for SQUID-based amplifiers for cryogenic detector readouts.",

The advantages of conventional winglets have been demonstrated ontransport aircraft and business jets.  Phase I of this effort demonstrated that even greater results can be obtained by modified winglets of new design.  Phase II will develop and demonstrate prototype models of these new winglets that can be used for avariety of applications in unmanned air vehicles, general aviation craft, and commercial airliners. The incorporation of all the innovations proposed here will produce maximum reduction in induced drag, leading to improved range and endurance, andreduction on wing dynamic response, leading to improved ride quality and fatigue life.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A significant technical challenge presented by future space-based precision deployable structures (NGST, SBL and others) is the requirement that the structure be rigid after deployment.  This requirement is warranted, as a very stiff, dimensionally stablestructure simplifies system control complexity and improves system reliability.  To create a rigid structure, the components must be fixed in the deployed configuration with ultra-stiff latches (stiffness>1X106 lbf/inch).  The proposed innovation willvalidate self-rigidizing, ultra-high stiffness capture latch (HSL) technology for deployable structures. Ultra-high stiffness is obtained through solidification of low melting point metal alloy within the latch joint. This unique, innovative approach isfundamentally different from other latching concepts. It has the potential to provide extremely high stiffness from a compact, lightweight package, enabling the development of highly stiff deployable structures.The proposed innovation can also be applied to deployable or separable space structures requiring zero dead band and high strength.  Generally, in large structures with articulated joints, current joining methods (elements pre-loaded together by springs,motor torque or cam lock devices) require high pre-load, resulting in mass-prohibitive and high release shock systems.  Such system-level issues are easily resolved using the proposed innovation.  Enabling applications include:,h Self-rigidizing hinge joints - A small spring or motor powered hinge joint combined with HSL will give high deployed strength, high stiffness and zero dead band at low mass.,h Smart space structures - A hybrid application of HSL with Starsys PPM (Part Per Million",

Planar processing has the potential to perform certain types of computation algorithms thousands to tens of thousands timesfaster than traditional Von Neuman processors (e.g. Pentium).  Image recognition/classification and speech recognition are two such areas where planar processing would offer major computational advantages.  Optics is ideal for planar processing because ofits image nature.  BR is a key enabling material to permit this form of optical processing due to its robust set of properties that are optically manipulated.  BR has the advantage of being very sensitive, inexpensive to produce, has good dynamic range,and can be easily formed into many sizes and shapes.  BR's parameters will be enhanced for various optical computing functions.  A demonstration planar processor utilizing BR will be constructed and image recognition algorithms will be evaluated as part ofthe demonstrations.",

In Phase I, the creative plans for the materials were developed       and researched for effectiveness. Phase II products will include; three              videotapes and accompanying print booklets, two sets for a general audience of       older adults 65 and older and their caregivers and one set specifically              targeted toward caregivers, and an Internet module. Production of the Phase II       products will incorporate Phase I findings into the production of three              broadcast quality videotapes, design and printing of the three booklets, and         the development of a prototype interactive Internet module. Before completion,       these materials will be reviewed by the Board of Advisors and focus group            tested with target audiences and health professionals to ensure that each            product meets the informational as well as the supportive needs of older adults      and their caregivers. The video, print, and website materials will then be           quantitatively tested with older adults and their caregivers to measure              effectiveness and impact on overall health education and support.                    PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The complete educational packages will be marketed to older adults and their caregivers  through physicians, mental health professionals, caregivers and organizations that serve  older adults.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Silicon carbide (SiC) is the most promising substrate material for the next generation high power, high frequency power transistors replacing traveling wave tube for radar power applications. Such devices in both, group III nitrides (III-N) and SiC havebeen under development for these applications.  SiC possesses advantages that are unmatched by any other substrate for both III-N and SiC based devices. High frequency power transistors fabricated on semi-insulating silicon carbide (SI-SiC) substrates (viaheteroepitaxy or homoepitaxy) will benefit significantly from the substrate's high thermal conductivity to dissipate heat generated during operation.  Devices made on SI-SiC substrates have an added advantage of increased frequency performance due to thelower parasitic losses compared to conducting substrates.  In addition, SiC is well suited for growth of III-nitrides due to its small lattice mismatch. Reduced lattice mismatch is critical in achieving low defect density layers in heteroepitaxial growth.",

This intelligent identification software module (IISM) will perform as well as or better than human watch standers. We will knowledge engineer currentCDC identification experts, since it is not anticipated that identification will occur much differently than in current carriers. Based on that elicited knowledge, we will design the CDC Knowledge Representation and Execution System (CKRES). This will beused to develop the IISM in three versions. The IISM will be interfaced to the Advanced Battle Station (ABS) and other systems for demonstration of capabilities and testing. The IISM will be thoroughly validated, verified, and tested in a wide range ofsituations.To develop IISM, we will first develop CKRES which facilitates the development of any automated watchstation software module. AI and Expert System technology offer the capability of capturing human decision processes. By developing a general schema forcapturing the knowledge required for each TFCC/CDC position, the development of these TFCC/CDC automation software modules is greatly facilitated. What is needed is an integrated approach using a broad range of technologies. We will use several AItechniques such as task transition diagrams, knowledge-based representations (rules, objects), model-based reasoning, case-based reasoning, intelligent entities, tactical diagrams, constraint-satisfaction, and fuzzy logic.",

Additionally, AWARE will work in the background to provide continuously improving results over time by applying progressively more sophisticated document clasification, document summarization, and graphically facilitated relevance feedback techniques. AWARE will provide NASA personnel with a dramatically improved awareness of Web information pertinent to their ongoing tasks. The prototype tool developed in our Phase I effort will prove the feasibility of our approach and provide the basis for a complete Phase II implementation of AWARE.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         As ever more of industry and commerce moves onto electronic networks,  there is a growing appreciation for the usefulness of expressive general  models of enterprise activities, such as design and manufacturing.  Ontologies are commitments to formal declarative multi-purpose  representations with clear semantics that can serve as a solid foundation  for such models. While there has been much work on representation  languages, and on tools for creating, browsing, editing, and translating  expressions in such languages, there has been relatively little attention  to supporting the larger process of figuring out what ought to be encoded  in an ontology. Some existing tools support collaborative teams, but by  and large they seem to assume that all team members will be AI experts and  that the work will focus on generation and manipulation of formal  expressions. In this project, we propose to develop a complete prototype  of a Domain Expert Collaborative Ontology Development environment (DECODE)  that ensures those who best understand the domain, but least understand  the technology of ontology, can make necessary contributions to the  development process. DECODE will support development of ontologies in the  context of solving systems integration problems; this systems integrations  payoff will help to motivate investment in ontology development.",

It may therefore be readily applied to many different domains. It will also include spatial constraints scheduling. Using on our extensive intelligent scheduling system experience, we have systematically examined each decision made in a wide range of scheduling systems and are proposing an IOSS which subsumes a large number of scheduling problems by making each decision customizable. Proposed Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques include Constraint Satisfaction, Intelligent Entities, Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), and Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA). In phase I we will knowledge engineer expert KSC schedulers, develop applicable knowledge representation and AI scheduling techniques, investigate the integration requirements with existing tools, design the full-scale system, and develop a limited, proof of concept prototype.",

These skills include modeling a thinkingenemy, using all available assets, and considering how the commander's fight fits into the bigger picture from friendly and enemy perspectives.  Such reasoning skills cannot be taught simply as methods and procedures to be followed.  Achieving expertlevels of proficiency requires extensive practice, coaching, and feedback.  Such mentoring-currently quite rare-is exemplified by tutoring sessions centered on Tactical Decision Games (TDGs), which we studied during Phase I.SHAI proposes to develop the Command Mentoring Intelligent Tutoring System (ComMentor) to provide automated instruction that emulates the Socratic interaction observed in expert TDG tutoring.  As demonstrated in Phase I, SHAI will employ a combination ofrule-based and case-based techniques.  A case library composed of good and bad solutions to each tactical scenario can be matched against a learner's solutions to assess reasoning skills.  We have assembled an outstanding team to pursue this research, andwe offer significant relevant experience developing scenario-based intelligent tutoring systems, principle-based instruction, rationale capture and reasoning systems, and intelligent agents embedded within tutoring and simulation systems.",

Investigators will create a unique health education resource         combining a multimedia instructional system, Internet communication, and touch       screen technology to help the elderly maintain their health and functional           independence by avoiding costly injuries and infirmities. Making Homes Safe for      Seniors is a CD-ROM /Online/Hybrid that provides instruction in English and          Spanish, and will connect learners to a dedicated web site where they can seek       advice from experts, share adaptive home repair solutions with others, perform       an interactive safety check-up of their living environment, and shop for             adaptive devices and safety items. The program is accessible to a wide range of      learners since the easy-to-use touch screen operation obviates the need for          technical skills while the graphics and narration mitigate the need for reading      skills. Feasibility testing of a prototype module in Phase I showed a                significant impact on learning and positive acceptance of the multimedia             delivery system by older learners. Extensive formative evaluation during the         program completion process will be conducted with 130 elderly subjects from an       inner city community Center for Senior Citizens. A multi-wave panel study will       assess the short and longer-term impact of the finalized program on knowledge        acquisition, risk reduction, and incidence of injuries in the home environment.      A repeated measures ANOVA model will constitute the basic analysis of a sample       of 120 tri-ethnic subjects. This program has wide commercial appeal and will be      sought out by a host of learners including families, community groups, and           members of the health care professions who will make this program and the            remainder of the projected series an indispensable tool for positively               impacting the health of an aging population.

Thermal spray is a rapidly growing element of the metals processing industry, which needs process control. Currently, there are no direct particle condition controls, for lack of a sensor to provide real-time measurements. This imaging sensor technology will continuously view the entire particle stream, utilize the entire emission across the spectral range of the sensor, and employ fast image processing algorithms to obtain on-line measurements. Phase II will develop a sensor response model, hardware and software design, and prototype sensors will be constructed and calibration tested. These sensors will be incorporated in process control systems and operated in an industrial environment. Thermal spray technology is changing and improving the way high quality metal parts are manufactured for the automotive, aerospace, energy, and heavy equipment industries. Sensor and thermal spray controls will provide new levels of cost efficiency and consistency to challenges in material processing, namely thermal, wear and corrosion, by coating the surface with metals and ceramics",

The achievements include: (1) developed an innovative M-integral method; (2) developed and validated 2-D environmentally induced degradationmodels; (3) implemented autoadaptive mesh technology in composite bonded joints, especially in the region of stress concentrations; (4) demonstrated the validity and applicability of the algorithms by comparing with experimental results for the double-lapshear specimen; and (5) developed a prototype software BondJoint.             The goal of the Phase II project is to provide a complete design solution to predict the long-term lifetime durability of composite structures with bonded joints under realistic service environments including cyclic moisture, cyclic temperature, andcyclic mechanical loading. To achieve this objective, the following innovative tasks have been identified and will be carried out: (1) identification of failure initiation site from corners by the use of M-integral for extraction of generalized stressintensity factors; (2) comprehensive failure criteria coupled brittle and ductile materials together; (3) crack growth (damage) simulation algorithm enabling to trace arbitrary crack growth path; (4) comprehensive degradation models with time-dependent andcoupled diffusion-reaction characteristics fro three materials systems, FM-300, PMR-15, and BMI; (5) Windows NT based software promises a wide applicability; and (6) flexible software structure to accommodate the user-defined failure criteria. A simulationdesign tool, BondJoint, will be generated to perform accurate durability, damage, and design evaluations and to predict accurately the long-term lifetime durability of bonded joint under realistic service conditions for repair of current aircrafts and fornext generation aircraft fleet.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Description: (Applicant's abstract) The present application is to fully develop      a new strategy (called \"tethering\") to discover low molecular weight ligands         (about 250 Da) that bind weakly to targeted sites on proteins through an             intermediary disulfide tether. A native or engineered cysteine in a protein is       allowed to react reversibly with a library of disulfide-containing molecules at      concentrations typically used in drug screening. The cysteine-captured ligands,      which are readily identified by mass spectroscopy, are among the most stable         complexes even though in the absence of the covalent tether the ligands may          bind very weakly. This method was applied to generate a potent and novel             inhibitor for thymidylate synthase, an essential enzyme in pyrimidine                metabolism with therapeutic applications in cancer and infectious diseases. The      affinity of the untethered ligand (Ki about 1 mM) was improved 3000-fold by          synthesis of a small set of analogs with the aid of crystallographic structures      of the tethered complex. Such site-directed ligand discovery allows one to           nucleate drug design from a spatially targeted lead fragment. In Phase I, we         developed the overall strategy and applied it to bacterial thymidylate               synthase. In Phase II, we will optimize the strategy and apply it to human           thymidylate synthase, an important anti-cancer target.                               PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  As this technology is developed it will provide a new and general method for drug-lead  discovery, applicable to many protein-ligand or protein-protein interactions.  The method  is more efficient than classic or combinatorial library screening, and will therefore allow   us to find drug leads more rapidly and with less expense.  The first protein studied,   thymidylate synthase, is a validated target for both anti-cancer as well as anti-microbial  agents, and will therefore lead to development of new drugs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant): X-ray mammography is a key research area        for improvement in breast cancer detection through screening programs. Primary       digital acquisition appears to have theoretical advantages for generation of         high quality images compared to film-screen receptors, including potentially         superior latitude and dose efficiency. However, technological considerations of      currently available CCD technology limit the maximum area that this type of          system can practically image to less than that required for general screening        purposes. Also, these sensors suffer from significant image quality problems         due to the light conversion process in the X-ray converter.                                                                                                               A concept for digital X-ray mammography was demonstrated in the Phase I              research that has the potential to overcome the limitations of conventional          imaging systems. Prototype sensors were fabricated that demonstrated                 sensitivity at least equivalent to film-screen systems for standard mammography      X-ray sources, with superior resolution and dynamic range. This system was           shown to have the potential to greatly exceed the capabilities of currently          available systems. A compact system may be fabricated into standard screening        size formats with dramatically improved image quality to serve as replacements       for mammography cassettes.                                                                                                                                                We shall complete the development of the new mammography X-ray sensor during         Phase II, and use it with actual pre-clinical samples to quantitatively compare      results to existing systems. For the first time his technology will allow X-ray      mammography image quality to be determined by the underlying digital sensor.     PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The market for mammography screening equipment is in the billions of dollars. A low-cost, large-area format X-ray imager with significantly higher image quality than current systems provide will find widespread acceptance in many medical and industrial settings.",

The key element in our novel and potentially highly efficient non-thermal plasma production technique,already demonstrated in our Phase I SBIR program, is initiating a plasma in an atmospheric pressure gas stream using very short pulses of microwaves.  This development enables us to produce free radicals such as OH, and O that attack hazardous or TIMparticles and kill micro-organisms very efficiently.  Bacterium Bacillus cereus will be used as an indicator of the plasma efficacy in destroying airborne pathogens.  Efficacy of killing E-coli bacteria will be used for the sterilization simulation testsof surfaces in food processing or medical facilities.  The proposed method is both highly electrically efficient and highly effective at destroying airborne TIMs and anthropogenic particles suspended in air or on surface.  Since it is also cost effectiveand practically maintenance free, it is clearly superior to other non-thermal plasma methods.  In Phase II, a mobile field application prototype of a microwave discharge plasma decontamination system will be fabricated to demonstrate the full air andsurface cleaning capability.  Potential application include sterilization of surfaces in food processing, medical facilities, combat environment or direct skin decontamination.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         60746         Nb3Sn superconductor, produced by the powder-in-tube (PIT) method has shown excellent critical density and strain tolerance.  Based on performance alone, PIT-type conductors would be utilized in many high field magnet applications including high energy physics.  However, the high cost of production has limited widespread adoption of this promising conductor.   This project will develop cost reduction techniques for the production of PIT Nb3Sn superconductors.  This includes reducing the cost of the NbSn2 powder by new manufacturing techniques, producing Nb tubes by hot extrusion resulting in uniform composite tubes, and using hydrostatic extrusion for multifilamentary billets.  In Phase I, a single step reaction heat treatment was developed to produce uniform, homogenous NbSn2 powder (<5m).  Nb tubes were manufactured by both tube extrusion and salt core extrusion.  A multifilamentary PIT wire was constructed and drawn such that the filament diameter reached 100 um diameter.  Samples were heat treated under a range of conditions and then tested for critical current density.  In Phase II, the processes will be scaled up to larger qualities so that yields can be further increased and costs reduced for producing the NbSn2 powder.  A novel chemical synthesis approach to NbSn2 production will be investigated.  Composite Nb tubes will be produced in larger sizes for use in the scale up attempt.  Hydrostatic extrusions will be attempted in order to produce multifilamentary wires.                         Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: High performance, low cost multifilamentary Nb3Sn should find applications in high energy physics particle accelerators and fusion machines.  Commercially, the conductor should find application in high field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance magnets and in cyrocooled MRI magnets to take advantage of the high critical temperature of Nb3Sn",

In this project, an innovative route will be used to fabricate flexible Nb3Sn cables that in turn could be used to fabricate Nb3Sn magnets by the more reliable and economical react-then-wind approach.  In Phase I, a gas mixing setup, using an oxygen analysis unit in conjunction with a programmable furnace, was designed and commissioned.  The system uses a computer data acquisition unit to continuously monitor the oxygen level during the heat treatment of Nb3Sn cables. The feasibility of producing flexible Nb3Sn cables by controlling oxide layer thickness was demonstrated, and between-wire bonding within sample cables was studied.  Phase II will continue to exploit the advantages of oxide-control in fabricating flexible Nb3Sn cables, scale-up for intermediate scale productions, adapt the approach to use high performance internal tin Nb3Sn wires, conduct transconductance and stability measurements, and fabricate and characterize high current flexible Nb3Sn cables.                         Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The flexible Nb3Sn cables should find application in next generation particle accelerators, energy storage, fusion reactors, and NMR magnets.",

SVT Associates proposes to meet this need by developing a tandem cell composed of InGaAsN (1eV), GaAs (1.4 eV) and InGaP (1.85 eV) lattice matched to GaAs substrates. A projected efficiency of 38% would be obtained from this tandem cell. The key innovation of this device is the deposition of the InGaAsN material. This will be done using an atomic nitrogen source and an unique surfactant to enhance the growth process. We will team up for this program with Prof. W. I. Wang's group at Columbia University who has extensive experience with the growth of InGaAsN for laser applications. Bulk films and PN structures will be deposited and characterize. The quantum efficiency of InGaAsN diodes will be measured and used to estimate the efficiency of the tandem cell.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         GaInSb/InAs superlattices show great promise as materials for use in very long wavelength infrared (VLWIR) detectors.  This III-V compound offers advantages over current HgCdTe technology in both anticipated performance level and ancillary support system(e.g. cryogenic cooling) costs.  Due to its piezoelectric characteristic, (111)-oriented superlattice lowers the effective bandgap energy when compared to the same structure on (100), thereby more easily extending the operating wavelength into the VLWIRregime.  However, growth on (111) substrates is known to be very challenging.  During Phase I, we have demonstrated the growth of (111) superlattices, and identified problems associated with growth difficulties.  We believe the material problems could besolved by employing the Engineered Substrate concept proposed for Phase II investigation.  The compliant nature of such substrates will be able to accommodate the strain in the superlattice structure, and promote smooth 2-D epitaxy and sharp interfaces.Therefore we will be able to address the fundamental material issues and the work should lead to high performance VLWIR materials and devices.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Differences in digital test source file formats and tool usage requirements can complicate the manual translation from one format to another.  The involved complexities and high count occurrences of needed operations clearly require the use of modernautomated software and computers.  One instance of a need for digital test information translation is apparent in the case of LASAR V files.  The files were generally developed on VAX or Sun computer based tools and have become obsolete and unusablewithout conversion tools to update them to newer versions of LASAR or preferably the IEEE 1445 standard for digital test interchange format (DTIF).  PC based tools would by far be the preferable methodology for doing this translation because the overheardand system management required for the VAX and Sun Sparc systems can add excessive costs to any comparable effort.  What is needed is a PC based set of tools for conversion of LASAR V data files and other formats to IEEE-1445 DTIF format and a comparabletranslation from the DTIF to LASAR VI and other formats.  The associated proposal discusses an approach for researching, developing, producing, and commercializing such a tool.",

In Phase I, SOCexamined four areas of potential improvements in sub-pixel classifiers; 1) hardware acceleration, 2) using spatial/spectral algorithms to improve speed and accuracy, and 3) using geo-specific material spectra to drive the classification.Our research showed that 1) hardware acceleration cost effectively improves performance by a factor of 100 or more,  2) spatial algorithms have potential, but require more research before incorporation in the the classifier, and 3) commercial satellitedata is spectrally poor and contaminated by the atmosphere; consequently, the use of geo-specific spectra could only offer marginal improvements.To reach our goals of fast, inexpensive and accurate, SOC proposes the following in Phase II:  Construction of a Wintel-based automated classification system using SOC hardware.  Continuing research into hybrid spatial/spectral algorithms to improveaccuracy.

When corrosion is preenet under the coating the dielectric signature changesbecuase corrosion products are dielectrics.  It is this change caused by the presence of cororsion that is exploited in development of microwave corrosion detectors (MCDs).  In Phase I a successful MCD pre-prototype was built that detected corrosion underaircraft paints and appliques in a repeatable and reliable fashion.  The Phase II proposal seeks to optimize for aircraft corrosion detection under coatings in three ways - (1) by improving the microwave assembly through componenet selection and designmodification, (2) by developing electronic threshold circuits and displays, and (3) by developing a scanning truck and housing system that make the sensor easy to use on aircraft surfaces.  After an alpha prototype that integrates and tests theoptimization efforts, 20 beta level prototypes will be manufactured.  These will be distributed to NAVAIR and Delta Airlines for evaluation.  Also at this time the beta level MCDs will undergo Navy NDE qualification testing.  After theevalaution/qualification period, Phase II Option proposes to refine the design once more before producing 50 units for Fleet demos and use.  Transition to commerical markets is handled by keeping the costs below a $1000 a unit and distributing throughcompanies that supply the aircraft industry with inspection devices and tools.",

The reducedmuzzle motion  provided substantial improvements in the accuracy of the 30-mm gun and reduced recoil load transmission to the airframe during high rates of fire.In Phase II, existing MR fluid damper analysis and design methodology will be refined to incorporate micro-mechanical fluid effects to develop full-scale, retrofit MR dampers.  Active control strategies investigated in Phase I will be refined and evaluatedin Phase II using an experimentally-validated multi-body gun dynamics analysis.  During the 2-year Phase II effort, full-scale MR dampers will be built and systematically live fire tested on a M230 chain gun at a research grade ballistic range incollaboration with the Apache chain gun systems integrator, the Boeing Company. A feasibility study will be undertaken at the end of Phase II to determine the operational viability of the MR dampers on the Apache helicopter chain gun and other Army weaponsystems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Loss of control in aircraft can result from changes in the controlled element, the control system, the environment, or adverse pilot-vehicle interaction. Each of these paths can be characterized by a loss of phase margin. It is not possible to predict or compensate for all possible sources of additional phase lag in the design process, and so there is a need for on-line health monitoring of the flight control system. The challenge then is to detect the erosion of phase margin in a timely manner and either warn the pilot or automatically take corrective action. In the Phase I effort we intend to use an innovative Time Varying Transfer Function technique to track the phase margin of a time-varying system. These special transfer functions are based on Wavelet Transforms. In contrast to windowed Fourier transforms, these transforms have the ability to analyze a signal at multiple scales, thus allowing for quick response to high frequency changes in the system, without sacrificing low frequency resolution. In Phase I we will develop the methodology and an associated on-line health monitoring toolbox to implement our approach. Example scenarios and available flight test data will be used to demonstrate feasibility.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In today's changing world, Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are critical components in modern high precision, high-speed avionic, satellite, telecommunications, video, and audio systems.  Conversion of analog signals to digital signals with sufficientlyhigh resolution and sampling rates is often a limiting factor in the performance of these systems.  Recent technological advances have accelerated the demand for high resolution/high bandwidth ADCs with low power consumption.Given the limitations of current technologies, these harsh requirements are difficult to meet using normal approaches.  Oversampling ADCs based on Delta-Sigma modulators have become prominent in meeting these more stringent demands, because this approachpermits high resolution without the need for analog components with extremely tight tolerances.  However, improved accuracy with relaxed component requirements comes with the price of oversampling and the associated limited conversion rate.During the course of the Phase I program, Systran Federal Corporation (SFC) investigated several approaches to the ADC problem and has introduced an innovative architecture called Parallel Time Interleaved Multi-bit Feedback (PTIMF).  SFC and Wright StateUniversity are proposing to further enhance this technology and fabricate a prototype of the design in silicon.  Devices developed based on this technology would be very beneficial to the DoD and the semiconductor industry.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant): Existing high school drug abuse prevention      programs primarily target youths who already have defined drug use problems.         Effective research-based prevention programs that target a universal audience        are not yet widely available. This Phase II project will continue the                development of All Stars, Sr., a program to improve mediating processes              important to late onset prevention and self-initiated cessation. Mediators           targeted include: lifestyle incongruence, normative beliefs about the                prevalence and acceptability of drugs, commitment to avoid high-risk behaviors,      resistance skills, beliefs about social and psychological consequences, goal         setting, decision making, and stress management skills. The program is designed      to augment (rather than replace) existing high school health textbooks.              Materials consist of a teacherts guide containing detailed lessons and a             student wellness journal. Results from Phase I support the approach taken and        provide a guide for program modification and improvement. During Phase II,           additional written activities and new online teacher and student materials will      be developed. A randomized field trial will be conducted. Health teachers in         twenty schools will be assigned to either treatment or control conditions.           Students will be measured at four points in time over a two-year period to           assess changes in mediators and the prevalence and frequency of substance use.       PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Drug use continues to be a serious problem in the country. The US Department of Education is expected to increase funding for effective prevention programs during the coming years. We are increasingly being asked to provide follow-up sessions for the middle school All Stars programs. There is a relative lack of universal prevention programming available for high schools. The increasing need and lack of viable alternatives suggests this project will result in a product that will have excellent market potential.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A revolutionary approach is proposed to obtain in real time, aerodynamic loads and moments in terms of the instantaneous locations of principal aerodynamic flow phenomena such as the stagnation, flow separation, reattachment, boundary-layer transition, etc. The stability, control, safety, ride quality, and performance of flight vehicles depends upon the instantaneous values of aerodynamic loads and moments, as well as on their derivatives. In recent years successful attempts have been made to introduce flow separation or vortex breakdown point as an inner variable in the state-space representation to mathematically model unsteady aerodynamic loads and moments. Tao Systems has developed techniques to obtain these aerodynamic flow phenomena in real time using hot-film sensors, constant voltage anemometer system, and associated flow diagnostics software. However, there are no techniques currently available to directly obtain aerodynamic loads and moments in terms of these inner variables. The proposed innovation will provide direct input in terms of aerodynamic flow features for the determination of loads and moments, as well as the dynamic stability and control derivatives for flight vehicles under real time flight conditions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This proposal identifies a flight test program on the F-15B at NASA Dryden to obtain off-design performance of high-speed inlets that incorporate a unique variable geometry system. The proposed effort accomplishes two objectives; validation of engine face distortion prediction by complex CFD codes and validation of a unique new approach to variable geometry for high-speed inlets. For supersonic cruise, this variable geometry concept allows the consideration of very high performance axisymmetric inlet designs that normally have required complex, heavy variable geometry concepts to effect the necessary throat area variation. The proposed concept also provides increased design options for hypersonic inlets. Aerodynamic design, model fabrication and flight testing of two inlets, one with the unique variable geometry and a baseline configuration, will be completed. This proposal responds to the SBIR subtopic by proposing a study in which prediction of inlet distortion by using complex CFD codes can be validated by comparison with data from a flight program. It is expected that this effort will also verify acceptable lower speed performance for an inlet designed to utilize the concept of this proposal. This advance in inlet technology will enable development of efficient and safe propulsion systems for supersonic or hypersonic vehicles.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         60879          Semiconductor plants are currently in need of ultrapure water with <1 ppb total organic carbon (TOC) levels, yet current methods to produce ultrapure water are energy intensive and limited to minimum TOC levels in the range 2  5 ppb.  This project will develop a novel photocatalytic membrane that provides intimate mixing of the dilute stream with the catalyst and activating photons.  In addition, a highly active TiO2 photocatalyst coating will be developed and applied to the novel membranes.  Phase I demonstrated a capability to achieve TOC levels of less than 1ppb using the innovative catalyst support structure.  A preferred catalyst coating material and application method was also determined.   In Phase II, the membrane design will be analytically optimized to maximize mass transfer rates and volumetric photoexposure of the treatment stream.  Catalyst coating materials and methods will be refined and the fabrication process will be scaled-up to a pilot scale reactor that will be tested in the laboratory and then in the field at a selected semiconductor fabrication plant.                      Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The three primary industries that use ultrapure water are semiconductor fabrication, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, and power generation.  The total estimated market for ultrapure water is $190 Million annually.  The semiconductor industry will benefit from the new water purity levels enabled by the proposed technology for both raw water and recycled water.  This technology is needed in order to keep pace with the water purity guidelines set forth in the National Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors.",

Rapid delivery of key items to deployed mobile units is a must for military strategists.  Effective logistics/supply-chain management allows just-in-timedistribution of goods and services. Current technologies are available to evaluate inventory levels across the supply chain. The use of the World Wide Web allows faster flow-through times in supply chain pipelines. Many commercial and militaryorganizations are feeling an urgent need to integrate an extended enterprise logistics system.USMC 's Precision Sea-Based Logistics is a human-factored, computerized system that requires Total Asset Visibility (TAV) of spare parts, issuance of repair notifications, tracking of maintenance history, and cost. USMC plans to deploy a sea-basedlogistics system. TPI proposes to develop a centralized information logistics system that is based on a fully extended enterprise model.The Phase I effort was focused on developing, integrating, and testing technologies for a Precision Sea-Based Logistics (PSL) system. The PSL system will allow automatic tracking of spare parts, status of maintenance actions, cost accounting, prognasics,decision support, and wire and wireless communication of logistics data using standard protocols. The successful research resulted in an intelligent, proactive, software agents based, architecture called the Autonomic Logistics Framework (ALF). Based onALF, TPI developed an architecture for the PSL system. The AL framework was validated using a pilot PSL example.During Phase II, we will be developing a demonstrator for the PSL system. We will be testing the demonstrator in an operating environment on USMC's Avanced Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAAV). During Phase II option, other conventional ground vehicleplatforms will be tested.",

During Phase I ofthis SBIR topic, it was demonstrated that existing elevation anglemodels, which represent higher sea-states using a flat surfacewith a suitable roughness coefficient, contain serious flaws. ForPhase II of this topic, TSC proposes to validate, demonstrate, andimplement a technique - whose feasibility was demonstrated inPhase I - to overcome these flaws. It utilizes a parabolicequation based propagation model, in conjunction with anoceanographically based ocean surface model, to yieldrealistically modeled elevation monopulse measurements inreal-time, under all propagation conditions, in the presence ofocean waves or variable terrain. TSC proposes to integrate thiscapability into its Electro-Magnetic Propagation Compressed DataEnvironment (EMPCODE) tool, developed under Phase II of SBIR topicN95-180, which supports real-time modeling of littoral propagationunder all refractivity conditions. This will result in a practicalcomposite tool, capable of providing consistent, real-timemodeling of both propagation and angle measurement under verybroad environmental conditions.",

Although particularly true for front-line forces, long-term success also requires capable and aware force sustainment.  Therefore, this ability is equallycritical for Combat Service Support (CSS).  On the digital battlefield, the technologies necessary to allow rapid planning and adaptation include:  1) data fusion, 2) analysis automation, 3) battlefield visualization, and 4) collaborative planning.  Aprototype Logistics Site Planning And Operation Tool (LOGSPOT) that planners can use to optimize site layouts and plan daily operations will be developed.  This tool, based on the concept development version developed during Phase 1, will be fully digital:capable of integrating information from electronic intelligence reports, radio frequency (RF) supply tags, digital terrain databases (vector, raster and imagery), and tabular logistic knowledge and rules.  The requirement for LOGSPOT to co-registergeographic data and provide high-quality map products implies the need for embedded Geographic Information System (GIS) functionality.

        "abstract": "Abstract         The application of industrial lasers in producing structuralshapes for shipbuilding will create enormous savings (in excessof $1M per Destroyer), plus result in a higher quality productthan produced by present methods.  This is because componentsfabricated from plate steel are inherently more precise and lowerweight than those produced form traditional rolled steel. A majorrequirement is the need for automatic categorization, nesting,and handling of steel plate used in fabricating structural shapes(i.e. I-beams, T-beams).  The key issue underlying thiscapability is that the flow of raw materials through the cuttingand welding process requires management of many components tocreate an optimized delivery of end product (fabricated parts)with minimal material waste of labor expense.  Development of anOptimized Structural Component Assembly Manager (OSCAM) isproposed.  This proposed approach will create a module systemcompatible with emerging CAD standards, commercial cutting andwelding systems and suitable for adaptation to variousmanufacturing requirements, with emphasis on shipbuilding. Toensure commercialization success, as part of this initiative, thelaser welding process and the product of the process will becertified.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The U.S. Army is currently involved with the study and development of an air-burst munition system for application on automatic medium caliber weapon systems, such as the M242 25 mm cannon. An air-burst munition is designed to detonate in the air over aspecific location in the battlefield to more effectively engage targets in defilade. An oboard programmable fuse typically controls the round detonation. The current systems under consideration by the U.S. Army possess significant drawbacks in that theyeither require costly fuse designs or additional heavy structure to be attached to the barrel muzzle, which is detrimental to pointing accuracy. In this proposal we present a novel fiber optic based system to measure round exit velocity (REV) that can beintegrated to an inductive fuse setting system for real time programming of a standard air burst munition fuse. The proposed barrel mounted system is small, lightweight, and low cost. The main objectives of this effort are to optimize the phase I system,fabricate a prototype, and conduct live-fire testing on an M242 to demonstrate performance. The proposed system has other advantageous uses including using the REV data to improve aiming accuracy and to monitor barrel wear and corrosion.",

The company has developed scheduling tools that allocate maintenance resources on the basis of elapsed calendar time and unit utilization. This project will augment these tools with condition assessment modules. If successful, the result would be a generally applicable system combining condition, time, and utilization as drivers for the maintenance process. The project will develop algorithms for condition assessment based on signal processing and feature extraction using both conventional sensors such as accelerometers, and 'next generation' sensors such as eddy current devices, fiber optic sensors, and MEMS sensors. These methods, when applied a maintenance service program, will lead to new methodologies for the synthesis of integrated diagnostics techniques and for the design of new hardware and software systems to realize those techniques for a wide range of practical applications.",

However, CORBA is not readily available for Fourth Generation Languages (4GLs) such as Visual Numerics` PV-WAVE or Research Systems` Interactive Data Language (RSI-IDL), which are widely used by scientists and engineers in the DOE community for data visualization.  This project will develop a set of tools to allow 4GLs to interoperate with CORBA.   Software will be developed that would take as its input the Interface Definition Language (CORBA-IDL) files and result in the wrapper functions that are needed to import CORBA objects in 4GLs as well as use the CORBA objects within the 4GLs.  The software would also allow 4GLs to be used as CORBA servers.  In Phase I, existing tools (SWIG, e.g.) for wrapping C and C++ code for use in scripting languages were analyzed.  To prove feasibility, examples of bringing CORBA into PV-WAVE and RSI-IDL were developed.   Prototypes of automatic tools for wrapping C++ stubs generated by the CORBA translator for use in these languages were implemented.   Phase II will develop a parser/code-generator application, idl4gl, which will allow CORBA applications to be built for RSI-IDL and PV-WAVE.  The application, idl4gl, will (1) parse CORBA-IDL files, (2) generate C wrapping code for CORBA stubs, (3) generate 4GL to call out C wrapped CORBA stubs, (4) create a C++ CORBA servant implementation, and (5) create empty 4GL functions to be filled in by the 4GL programmer.                     Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: Such tools could be licensed to the commercial firms currently providing 4GLs.  Consulting work would also be a part of the commercial endeavor.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         60781           The MAD (Modular Accelerator Design) code is the most widely used code worldwide for high-energy accelerator design but lacks a modern GUI (graphical user interface).  MAD-9, the latest version, has powerful new features needed for the design of the Large Hadron Collider and the proposed muon collider/neutrino factory, but the differential algebra engine needs work.  This project will develop a comprehensive GUI for MAD-9, using the cross-platform windowing toolkit Qt.  Significant effort will also be devoted to improving the differential algebra engine of MAD-9, and to ensuring that the code compiles and runs on all relevant desktop and workstation computers.  In Phase I, a prototype GUI was developed and integrated with MAD-9, enabling the interactive selection of input files, the generation of Twiss and beamline layout plots, and the modification of element and beamline parameters.  The GUI/physics linkage is clean and efficient, requiring no GUI references within the physics code.  In Phase II, the prototype GUI for MAD-9 will be completed, with emphasis on support for design and optimization features.  Relevant portions of this GUI will be integrated with a general purpose optimization library.  In collaboration with Brookhaven National Laboratory, the differential algebra engine of MAD-9 will be significantly improved and then used to support design studies of the high-energy muon storage ring for the proposed neutrino factory.                   Commercial Applications and Other Benefit as described by the awardee: The GUI will be free to MAD-9 users, to the benefit of high-energy accelerator designers and the Large Hadron Collider.  The need to use MAD on desktop and laptop PCs also should generate direct sales for the commercial PC version of the code.  There will also be a significant market for contract work to customize the core of the GUI for use with other scientific and engineering design codes.",

This project addresses the need for specialized networking components in the data acquisition system.  A scalable, gigabit-speed data acquisition platform (GDAP) will be linked to the most recent advances in software and hardware technology.  This platform will be a key component of the Compact Muon Solenoid detector data acquisition system scheduled for pre-production in 2003.  Phase I incorporated a number of key software and hardware features in the platform and successful operation was verified.  Ten modules were fabricated and delivered.  The  platform is currently being tested at CERN and the evolution path has been defined.  Phase II will develop a scaled down data collection system based on the module with expanded gigabit networking support options.  This system would provide the basis for a full scale implementation of the GDAP as well as testing of many data acquisition concepts that have only been simulated previously.

        "abstract": "Abstract         60848        Deepwater drilling operations are subject to blowouts because formation gas pressures ahead of the bit are unknown.  Seismic-while-drilling techniques can detect pore pressure ramps and range to pressurized formation tops, but, in most cases, the drill bit source is inadequate.  There is a need for a source of broadband, high-frequency seismic energy at the bit to allow accurate seismic-while-drilling with all bit types.  This project will develop a mud-powered hydraulic tool that generates intense narrow-band, high frequency seismic signals from tricone and PDC drill bits.  The tool cycle rate can be swept to generate broadband seismic energy for vertical seismic profiling and reflection imaging while drilling.  The objective is a real-time display of the formation 1000 ft ahead of the bit with a resolution of 50 ft.  This display would indicate the range to reflection horizons, formation velocity gradients and predicted pore pressure.  In Phase I, geophones placed on the surface were used to monitor the seismic signal transmitted to the surface from the suction pulse tool while drilling in a 2700 ft deep well.  These experiments showed that the tool generates high levels of seismic energy at frequencies of up to 200 Hz while drilling with tricone and PDC bits.  In Phase II, the hydraulic tool will be modified to continuously vary the pulse cycle rate through a full octave for broadband signal generation.  Performance will be demonstrated during normal drilling operations, and the data recording, processing, and display techniques will be evaluated.                          Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: Accurate seismic-while-drilling should reduce the economic, environmental and safety risks associated with deep gas exploration.  Pore pressure prediction will allow more accurate casing placement and reduced costs and risks  particularly in high-cost offshore and deep gas wells.  Seismic-while-drilling also should increase deep well success rates by allowing steering into the productive zone.",

The limiting factor in successful application of theseemerging language based interpreters is the poor quality of the speech captured fromthese tactical radio intercepted transmissions.  Recovery of the original qualityspeech responds to advanced signal recovery techniques, applying complex adaptivespline neural network recovery in combination with blind separation and speechdetection methods.  Similarly, the intelligibility of longhaul reach-backcommunications is dependent upon the same signal recovery technology as applied tomultiple link scenarios from the battlefield to CONUS.  Natural LanguageUnderstanding (NLU), language identification, language translation, speakeridentification, keyword spotting, gisting, language parsing and contextinterpretation are emerging technologies to be developed to achieve this automatedintelligence processing.  Innovative wideband signal recovery techniques, are usedfor accurate extraction of captured speech from the severely degraded transmissionintercepts, incorporating methods most beneficial for natural language algorithmperformance and to discount radio specific signatures.  Unique to this researchopportunity is the ability to merge our recent technology breakthroughs foridentifying and tracking speakers by stripping away radio channel masking andmultipath degraded tactical radio transmitted speech.

Petroleum based hydraulics are problematic in terms of environmental hazards, flammability, and cost. The Submarine External HydraulicSystem (SEHS) is especially susceptible to problems. A leak in this system releases hydraulic fluid directly into the ocean, and problems with seawater ingress, corrosion, and hydraulic fluid leakages have frequently occurred.During Phase II, TRI/Austin will develop new water based hydraulic fluid formulations and perform testing using SEHS system components. New, environmentally friendly high performance water based hydraulic fluids will be formulated and optimized. Screeningtests will identify the best water hydraulic fluid candidates for full scale SEHS testing at Sargent Controls & Aerospace.  Recommendations for SEHS component and system modifications for water based fluid compatibility will be provided as needed. Aproduct specification will be prepared.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Conventional flange-type pipe couplings used aboard U.S. Navy surface ships and submarines typically have a large number of axially oriented bolts located around the circumference of the flange.  The installation of conventional pipe couplings requiresequal access to all of the bolts to ensure evenly torqued joints.  The large number of bolts and accessibility difficulties with conventional pipe couplings results in a labor-intensive process for the removal and installation of these couplings.  Nearbystructures and equipment often have to be removed and reinstalled to gain access to the hidden bolts, or joints are inadequately tightened in cases where removal of nearby strucutres is not feasible.  Texas Research Institute Austin, Inc. proposes todevelop a low cost, lightweight, fire-resistant, easily accessible composite pipe coupling that meets the requirements of MIL-STD-777E.  The use of composite materials will reduce the cost and weight of the coupling while providing a reliable,fire-resistant, corrosion-free service life in excess of 15 years.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The combustible nature of polymeric cabling jacket materials usedaboard U.S. Naval ships is a critical issue for personnel safety.This cable jacket is the material that forms a protective layeraround a bundle of fibers, buffered fibers, ribbons or OFCC's.Current shipboard cable jackets are formulated with hydratedmetal oxide flame retardant (FR) additives in order to meet theNavy's requirement for non-halogenated compounds. Use of metaloxide FR additives results in jacket materials that meet Navalrequirements, however, these same formulations do not meetcommercial plenum requirements. A new dual use cable will allowthe Navy to procure cables from a larger base of suppliers. Inturn, this will foster a more competitive atmosphere foracquisitions resulting in cost savings for the Navy. Phase IIwork will be a continuation of the Phase I where the feasibilityof increasing polymer flammability resistance via a combinedapproach using nanocomposites and conventional non-halogentaed FRadditives was demonstrated. This will include optimization ofcable jacket compounds that will meet both MIL-PRF-85045F and UL910 flammability standards. Commercial transition of the productwill involve full-scale compounding of the jacket materials andcomplete cable fabrication by Chromatic Technologies, Inc. duringPhase II.",

The launch tube O-ring seal surfaces are exposed to seawater and are subject to corrosion resulting in a two yearservice life.  A polymer composite material is required that can replace the steel and extend the service life of the launch tube to 10 years.  Texas Research Institute Austin, Inc. proposes to develop a lightweight, low cost, corrosion-free polymercomposite material to replace the corrosion prone steel.  The composite material will meet the current launch tube design requirements including hydrostatic pressure, underwater explosive shock, shipboard vibration and ordnance testing.  The compositematerial will be non-water soluble, will not show significant degradation and will be able to form water tight seals over a 10 year service life.  During the Phase II Project prototype composite countermeasure launch tubes will be designed, fabricated,tested and qualified for installation aboard a test submarine for fleet trials.  At the conclusion of the project a fleet qualified production version composite launch tube will be ready for submarine service.",

The effects are exacerbated in theVery-Shallow-Water (VSW) and Surf Zone (SF) due to air-bubblesfrom breaking waves and sediment stirred-up by wave action.These unsavory acoustic conditions makes the detection andlocation of mines and obstacles in the VSW/SZ of potentialamphibious landings a virtual impossibility by conventional sonarsystems.

Phase I propagationmodel studies of such a system yielded mine detection ranges of~3,500 yards in the VSW/SZ.  For Phase II a GFE projector,identified as PADS-II projector, will be modified andrefurbished.  Corner-reflector hydorphones will be fabricated forreceiving both the primary frequency band and the parametricfrequency bands.

These barriers are (1) unreliable composite flange joints, and (2) heavy, expensive metal alloy bellows.The objectives are to cut both launch weight and cost by half.  Dynamic Polymer Composite (DPC) connectors clamp fixed pipe joints with a large prestress when heated.  They eliminate flanged joints adn join dissimilar materials with a smooth stress flowthat is stronger than the pipe itself. DPC expansion joints replace alloy bellows.  In Phase I both were validated by actual cryogenic pressure tests using prototypes not optimize for low temperature.  Prestress was found to eliminate cryo delamination.Fixed joints were tested to 4,500 psi.  Expansion joints demonstrated an axial travel of three inches (75mm).  Using existing space quailified materials, Phase II will develop and cryo test a series of DPC connections designed and scaled for one of theseven current rocket engines in a cyclical, cryogenic enviroment.  Test and modeling data will be integrated for transfer of the technology to contractors in preparation for PhaseIII flight-testing.  A large composite pipe producer is a commercial partenerfor use in oil and gas fields.  $300,000 has been committed. Eight market segements with a potential of $200 milliona year have been identified.  Alloy rocket fuel systems are $1.6 billion a year worldwide.",

The concept significantly improves operation of the temperature sensitive electronic components and reduces dimensional distortion of the antennaphased-array aperture.  The thermal control concept utilizes a phase change material (PCM), which exploits its large latent heat capacity to effectively store thermal energy during the daylight/electronic power-on periods and extract heat during theeclipse/power-off periods to maintain the antenna structure temperature and protect the electronic components during the cold soak.  The concept has several innovative features to enhance the thermal control of the antenna structure including: high thermalconductivity Gr/epoxy face sheets (for improved thermal spreading); high latent heat capacity phase change material (contained integrally within the antenna structure); and an ultra-low density/high thermal conductivity carbon foam core (for enhancedthermal transport between the PCM and antenna structure).  The overall design concept provides a mass efficient and highly effective thermal control approach that requires no additional parasitic power demands.",

We will investigate the feasibility of a system for detection of these kissing unbonds using a novel combination of pulsed thermography and applied vacuum stress. Both vacuum stress and flash heating will be applied to the part, and a differential IR image comparing the post-flash cooling of the stressed and unstressed part will be generated. The apparatus for acquiring the image and applying the heating and vacuum stress will be housed in a portable hood with a 10 x 10 field of view, and typical acquisition times of 20 seconds. If successful, the fully realized system will extend the capabilities of thermographic NDE systems to allow inspection of skin to core disbonds in honeycomb and foam core structures, and thick composite components used in the space shuttle and X-33, as well as commercial and military aircraft.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Modern vulnerability and survivability codes simulate the path of threat projectiles through a target using a technique known as ray tracing. Rays representing the threat are traced by finding intersections between the ray and the target geometry. Theroutines that find these intersections and the representation used to model the target geometry are central to any ray-tracing code. Standard vulnerability tools, such as the Modular Unix- Based Vulnerability Estimation Suite (MUVES), depend on a singleray tracer that requires that the geometry be in BRL-CAD constructive solid geometry (CSG) format. In general, designers and analysts employ commercial Computer Aided Design (CAD) packages such as Pro/ENGINEER that typically use a boundary representation(BREP) to represent solid geometry. For this reason a serious disconnect exists between vehicle design software and vulnerability assessment tools. The solution is the development of a new ray-tracing tool for vulnerability codes that could directlyinterrogate 3D-geometry models described by STEP (Standard for the Exchange of Product Model Data) files, an international standard for transferring CAD designs. The proposed modular ray-tracing tool will employ a standard and open interface, allowing itsuse with a variety of commercial CAD systems and vulnerability, signature, and reparability codes. Since most vehicle designers use Pro/ENGINEER or a commercial CAD package which supports STEP export, there will be an immediate application for this toolwithin the defense industry for anyone doing vulnerability assessment. MUVES, COVART, SAFE, MAVEN, and AJEM will all immediately benefit from a ray-tracer built around an industry-standard file format such as STEP. This ray-tracing tool can further enhancethe accuracy of IR signature predictions. While faceted geometry definitions do not adversely affect the calculation of temperatures and diffuse radiosity, signature management techniques often include the use of coatings for which the assumption ofdiffuse surfaces is invalid. When this is the case, the calculation must utilize the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) of the coating, and a technique such as Phong shading must be used to attempt to approximate the true surfacecurvature. The ray-tracing tool could improve on this process in two ways. First, it could map physical temperatures from a faceted model onto a solids model for the final BRDF ray-tracing. Second, if the components in the CAD model were selected so thatthey could be assumed isothermal, a direct-from-CAD-to-BRDF tool could predict temperatures and BRDF radiosity from a single CAD source. Additionally, the creation of a cross platform, object-oriented, multiple CAD ray-tracing module will have broadcommercial applicability. Examples include calculating the solar loading in automotive passenger compartment for simulating climate control and calculating the heat transferred between isothermal components in aerospace applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         It is proposed to develop a full prototype next-generation semi-flush flasher system for airport runway approach lighting.  Current systems are many years old and inefficient; airports need inset flashers to add runway length and more efficiently use strictly limited land allocations.  An inset flasher is proposed that is optimized both optically and electrically.  A flasher fixture based on the Phase 1 prototype will be optimized, fabricated, and tested, forming a Phase 2 prototype to be commercialized.  Phase  1 program feasibility was demonstrated by comparing prototype performance with FAA specifications and current systems and by assessing the practicality and value of the other program innovations.  Thoughtventions Unlimited LLC, specializing and research and development, and Flight Light, Inc., an 8(a) manufacturer of airport lighting systems are teaming to bring state of the art optics and commercial practice to the program.  The active and immediate participation of commercial partners will greatly aid practical development and speed the commercialization of this system, bringing earlier and more extensive needed improvements to airport lighting systems",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (applicant's abstract): The major objective of this research             program is to facilitate novel drug development for G-Protein Coupled Receptors      (GPCRs) using high throughput screening (HTS) protein structure-based drug           design (SBDD). GPCRs are integral membrane proteins found ubiquitously in human      tissues, and are associated with many diseases. The primary focus of this SBDD       effort will be based on engineered, soluble, N-terminal extracellular domain         analogs of GPCRs. Many GPCRs use a large N-terminal domain as an essential           ligand-binding component. Use of these analogs in drug discovery will eliminate      the need for detergents and lipids that often complicate HTS and SBDD efforts        for GPCRs.In Phase I we constructed a novel, soluble, N-terminal domain analog       of the glucagon receptor (N-GGR). Characterization of N-GGR revealed that            about80 percent of the binding free energy for glucagon resides within this          domain. Importantly, N-GGR discriminates against the related peptide, GLP- 1,        and competes with full-length GGR in functional assays. During the Phase II we       will determine the X-ray crystal structure of N-GGR and use it as an HTS target      for drug discovery. We will also validate N-GGR as a protein therapeutic. In         Phase III we will optimize small molecule leads into potential drugs ready for       in vivo pre-clinical and clinical testing.

When two TM-UWB radios communicate, each accurately learns their relative distance. In our system, this range data is used by the micro air vehicles for self organization and self healing of the communications network.TM-UWB radios do not transmit continuous radio waves like conventional radio.  Only pulses are transmitted, and power is used only during the short duration of those pulses. Pulses in the time domain result in very wideband signals in the frequency domain,which make them almost impossible to intercept and difficult to jam. The lower frequency component of the signal allows the signals to penetrate foliage, walls, and other obstacles, and TM-UWB is almost totally unaffected by multipath interference.  TheTM-UWB output stage is a single transistor which is ON or OFF, there is no intermediate frequency, and no up-conversion and no down-conversion.  This simplicity is critical for realization of the micro air vehicle, where even a few grams makes a differencein the design.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A tightly-sealing, non-corrosive miniature valve that can be baked and requires power only during on/off switching has many applications, especially in the semiconductor manufacturing industry.A tight seal (10e-10 SCCM) requires a large force. Ability to tolerate bake-out, corrosion resistance, and cleanliness (freedom from organic and hydrocarbon contaminants) limits suitable materials to stainless steel and similar metals.Large force, small volume, and light weight actuation are feasible using electrically-powered shape-memory alloy (SMA) devices. Incorporating a latching mechanism, so that power is required only during on/off switching, compensates for the large power requirement of SMA actuators.The proposed valve consists of a welded extensible tube containing a poppet and matching orifice. When closed, the poppet and orifice are pressed together by a bistable spring. The bistable spring latch mechanism is moved from closed to open position by a shape-memory actuator that elongates the extensible tube. A second SMA actuator reverses the latch from the open to the closed position. In Phase I, an all-metal poppet/orifice combination will be developed to give low leak rates, forceful SMA actuators will be designed and built, a suitable latching device will be designed, and proof-of-concept latching valves will be fabricated.",

Mass propagation techniques may now be economically applied to other field-transplanted horticultural crops and the potential benefits for U.S. agriculture can be extended to the rapid introduction of new varieties from several technologies including elite selections, genetic transformants, in vitro grafted selections and periclinal chimeras. Tissue-Grown scientists are working on a new variety development technology, based on the creation of interspecific chimeras, that may have immediate application for creation of elite disease resistant Cucurbit, Brassica and Solanum crops. With this Phase II proposal, Tissue-Grown outlines a project which combines large scale micropropagation with novel variety technologies to demonstrate that vegetatively propagated watermelon and tomato transplants with genetic-based resistance to Fusarium can be delivered on a commercial scale to the U.S. market. A key element for meeting the economic feasibility criteria for U.S. markets will be the delivery of high value germplasm that can compete with traditional seed based transplants. Tissue-Grown proposes that the combination of mass propagation with disease resistant transplants can provide a significant economic opportunity for vegetable production in the U.S.",

Materials which have improved specific strength and specific stiffness, especially at cryogenic and elevated temperatures, will enable NASA to meet these aggressive program goals by supporting the development of stronger, lighter and more thermally stable launch vehicle and spacecraft components. Touchstone's Brazed AMC material demonstrates all of these desired properties. This material has close to double the specific strength and specific stiffness of structural aluminum alloys. It also maintains these properties at higher temperatures than current aerospace alloys. As such, Touchstone's material can serve as an enabling technology for many launch vehicle and spacecraft applications, including engine and thrust structures, lines and ducts, cryogenic tanks, and satellite structures. This proposal discusses a new material system which can be an enabling technology in the development of these new launch vehicle and spacecraft components. The new material system consists of a continuously-reinforced aluminum matrix composite (AMC) material manufactured using techniques commonly used to produce polymer matrix composites (PMCs).",

Energy absorption, in the form of projectile impact and crash protection, and fire resistance are major safety benefits, and noise reduction is a serious comfort consideration. Several engineering materials offer very attractive specific mechanical properties (the ratio of properties to the density of the material). But a material being developed by Touchstone Research Laboratory, Ltd. of Triadelphia, WV, is unique in its combination of these properties with fire resistance, impact resistance/energy absorption, and the potential for large-scale, low-cost manufacture with relatively simple processing equipment. It is a lightweight foam made by the thermal decomposition of petroleum or coal precursors. Shown in the figures below, it can be fabricated in a variety of densities and cell structures to meet the weight, mechanical, and energy absorption requirements of a given application. Carbon foam offers the aviation industry a lightweight, structural material with superior energy and thermal-absorbing properties and enhanced fire protection.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         60443        High-performance batteries and fuel cells can lessen the nations dependence on combustion engines, reduce vehicular emission, and positively impact the electronics market.  However, the implementation of many of these technologies is hindered by the material performance of components.  For example, a common requirement of fuel cells and high-performance batteries is efficient, consistent performance from the electrode over its life.  This project will demonstrate the viability of transforming inexpensive coal derivatives into a tailorable porous electrode.  Such a component would reduce cost and weight and increase the performance and service life of fuel cells and batteries.   In Phase I, it was found that certain coal-based carbon foams had attractive electrochemical properties.   In Phase II, practical fuel cell and battery systems will be selected and coal-based foams will be designed to meet their requirements.  The design includes tailoring the foam cell size, connectivity, surface area, and surface chemistry.  Fuel cell and battery manufacturers will be recruited to produce and test prototypes fabricated from coal-based porous electrodes, analyze performance benefits, and guide further refinement of  the electrode specifications.                      Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: Coal-based carbon foam electrodes should improve the performance and reduce the cost of fuel cells and of carbon-zinc batteries, zinc-air batteries and lithium-ion batteries.",

Toyon Research Corporation proposes to develop asoftware toolbox to optimize jammer placement and configuration,as well as to perform route planning and evaluate missionperformance in a GPS-denied area. Rather than relying on a singleoptimization algorithm, the proposed toolbox includes multiplealgorithms, a flexible means of controlling their application,smart features to speed up the optimization process, and ascripting capability for easy customization to particular classesof problems. A prototype version of the toolbox has beendelivered to the Navy in Phase I of the development program.",

These algorithms will receive detections with signature information from synthetic apertureradars (SAR) and high-range-resolution-ground-moving-target-indicator (HRRGMTI) radars. The detections and signatures will be processed over time to form a continuous track of target vehicles even if they are traveling amongst other vehicles. This will bedone using innovative approaches to signature-aided tracking with both HRRGMTI and SAR signatures. The output of the algorithms will consist of a list of target locations and identities in addition to a set of sensor task requests. The sensor task requestswill provide feedback to the sensors so that they can be focused on particular regions in particular modes. For instance, when a moving target track is lost, a spotlight SAR request may be made to acquire the target in its stationary state. In addition todelivery of the algorithms, we propose to deliver a testbed to AFRL. The testbed can be used to evaluate the algorithms that we develop as well as other algorithms and concepts such as the tanks under trees (TUT) effort.",

While solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have the potential to overcome these problems, some of their electrochemical properties, such as ionic conductivity, are not satisfactory for high performance lithium batteries.   This project will develop a new class of solid polymer electrolytes, dendrimer solid polymer electrolytes, for lithium-based batteries.  These dendrimer SPEs will be designed to have superior electrochemical properties required for high performance lithium-polymer batteries.   In Phase I, the dendrimer SPEs were synthesized and processed into films, their electrochemical and mechanical properties were evaluated, and superior electrochemical properties were observed.   In Phase II, the properties of the dendrimer SPEs will be optimized, the preparation will be scaled-up,  and the new films will be evaluated for full battery cell performance.

Phase I also demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing advanced video compression technology (WaveNet) for low-bandwidth transmission of video over wireless LAN.The proposed Phase II effort has five key technical objectives which collectively provide a Maintenance and Telepresence System (MATS). The achievement of these objectives builds on the prototype developed and demonstrated during Phase I. The objectives ofthis Phase II SBIR project are:Address and plan resolution of MATS usability issues identified in Phase I.Address the key enabling technology areas that will be focused on to meet topic goals.Address Telepresence effectiveness issues.Address existing and proposed technologies to allow hands-free document navigation.Evaluate available virtual reality applications and assess how the MATS can use them.To assure a smooth transition to Phase III, the MATS design will be refined based on results shipboard evaluations. The final product will be a MATS suitable for shipboard use aboard Virginia-class SSNs and other U.S. Navy vessels with similar networkarchitectures.",

Better navigation aids must beprovided, and in a way that fits into the current communications infrastructure.The current DoD Standard Teleoperation Kit (STK), which allows any vehicle to becontrolled remotely, employs a standard broadband video link for communicationbetween the operator and vehicle.  This link is limited to line-of-sightapplications over a relatively short range.  In addition, it has been observedthat the monocular video provided for vehicle navigation can be inadequate forrecognition and avoidance of obstacles in the vehicle's path-ditches, fallen trees,etc. Leveraging its extensive background in video compression and transmission,Trident proposes to develop a video compression module for attachment to the STKthat provides high-quality stereo video imagery over a single SINCGARS radio link,and allow the operator to view the imagery in stereo.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will build on results of Phase I research to fully demonstrate an early warning system for potential failure of ceramic matrix composite (CMC) materials. In Phase I, a novel detection technique called Composite Failure Onset Response Test (ComFORT (TM)) was demonstrated for use with high temperature CMCs. ComFORT (TM) is a composite failure detection technique whereby proprietary thermally stable electrically conductive ceramic fibers are selectively placed, together with regular reinforcing fibers, and are then processed into a dense ceramic composite. Once in place, existing hardware is used to monitor the condition and the health of the electrical signal, while an especially designed algorithm minimizes false negatives during use. As the ceramic composite begins to fail, the failure of the fiber reinforcement is preceded by the failure of the conductive coating, which is recognized through a weakening or loss of electrical conductivity. This novel technique lends itself to a powerful early warning system, whereby the conductive fiber can be designed to fail before catastrophic failure of the composite itself. Proper placement of these conductive fibers enables tracking of even minute levels of breach within the composite. Moreover, through a novel design, it may be possible to extend the performance to detect matrix cracking. The lack of reliability and little to no warning before catastrophic failure has prevented a more widespread use of CMC's. The smart fiber system to be developed in this project will allow the use of CMC's in more demanding applications with greater certainty of success. The successful commercialization of the proposed technology will lead to the insertion of continuous fiber reinforced composites into power generation, energy, air, space and missile applications, where high temperature, lightweight, and mechanically reliable materials are needed, and the cost of part failures is high. Ceramic composites can be used in a larger number of these applications, if part reliability can be assured. Substantial benefits in operating efficiency of gas turbine, automotive and rocket systems can be realized with increased operating temperatures",

The AMC structural jacket enables the AGS gun system to meet Navy mission requirements of high rate and increased volume of fire, and increased muzzle velocity, by taking maximum advantage of active cooling in the AGS barrel.  Thehigh thermal conductivity and high strength AMC increases the life of large caliber gun barrels by reducing barrel bore temperature by a factor of two through its innate high thermal conductivity, and by reducing thermally induced barrel stress by a factorof four.  Decreasing bore temperature directly reduces bore wear, the primary cause of barrel failure.  Reduction of thermally induced stress directly increases the fatigue limit of the barrel, which is the secondary cause of barrel failure.The proposed program will develop the manufacturing techniques to fabricate the AMC structural jacket for the AGS in a cost-effective manner.  Material properties specific to the AGS operating environment will be determined and AGS barrel life cycle costswill be predicted.",

The Triton team willbuild on our Phase I successes to further develop our fabrication processes, CMC design methodologies, and material properties database for specific component/product applications. With our end-user team members, we will utilize the Triton CMC technologiesfor three component development thrusts, adaptive mirrors for high energy laser (HEL) systems, rocket propulsion compents for kill vehicles, and large, complex CMC structures with sophisticated fiber architectures for the next generation of high speedmissiles and space vehicles.  As a result of the Phase II program, we will have achieved the necessary innovations to produce cost-effective CMC products for use in a wide variety of military and commercial applications.  The additional developments anduse-environment specific material improvements will be the critical steps needed to insert Tritons' CMC technology into the US and world marketplace.  The components we initially develop will enable revolutionary advances in future generations of adaptivemirror, rocket propulsion, and missile or space vehicle TPS components in terms of reduced acquisition and lifetime maintenance costs, decreased system weights, and increased performance, impacting a number of BMD and other defense systems.  As we maturethe technology base, our development efforts will expand to focus on products which will penetrate the more lucrative commercial ceramic markets.

During the Phase I program, Tritonsuccessfully demonstrated the ability of our novel materials to outperform competing refractory materials, metal or ceramic, composite or monolithic, in terms of combining: Strength at elevated temperatures (10x columbium at 2350F, 20x tungsten at 4000f),Frature toughness (10x silicon carbide), Resistance to oxidation and erosion during liquid and solid rocket motor nozzle/chamber tests,  Fullstrength retention at ultimate operating temperatures above 5000F.  Manufacturing costs 10% to 250% less than other refractory components, resulting from inexpensive starting materials, near net shape green body machining, and pressureless sintering.During the Phase II program, the Triton team will make the necessary materials and process innovations to elevate this refractory technology to the state of readiness necessary to exploit the promise now being demonstrated for its use in a wide variety ofmilitary and commercial product applications.  The additional developments and use-environment specific material improvements will be the critical steps needed to insert Triton's technology into the US and world marketplace.  The components we initiallydevelop will enable revolutionary advances in future generations of rocket propulsion systems in terms of reduced acquisiton and lifetime maintenance costs, decreased system weights, and increased performance, impacting kill vehicle (KV) Divert andAttitude Control Systems (DACS), upper stage launch vehicle engines/motors, or commercial satelittle orbit insertion and station keeping motors as we mature the technology base, our development efforts will expand to focus on products which will penetratethe more lucrative commercial ceramic markets.

The laser fabrication process can produce high performance AMTEC materials that are more reliable and economical for long-life, high power generation for both deep space exploration and terrestrial applications.  Advanced fabrication/joining methods will be employed to permit the use of higher temperature stable materials.   Through controlled, localized heating, the heat-affected zone in the parent materials will be minimized.  Phase I demonstrated the fabrication of metal, ceramic and graded materials using the LF3 process and a clear path to producing continuous components for the tube/plenum assembly.  Phase II will establish the suitability of the proposed technology for producing components for the tube/plenum assembly.  AMTEC components will be produced directly from CAD models without the need for tooling or extensive machining.  Proof of concept will be shown through thermal cycling, helium leak testing, ionic conductivity, and thermal/sodium compatibility testing.                   Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: Space applications include deep space exploration, space-based radar and laser satellite platforms, and communications satellite power generation.  Terrestrial applications include home and business uninterruptible power supplies, remote power generation, and auxiliary power units for heavy duty trucks.",

The new tether can be woven or braided into a multi-strand tether. The Phase I effort will characterize different size fiber and weight % of metal cladding for candidate tethers, leading to a down-selected tether type. In late Phase I and early Phase II, developed tethers will be measured for diameter, weight, strength, flexibility, thermal-optical characteristics, conductivity and insulation properties.

Each has its own operational advantages and disadvantages. LHPs have tremendous pumping pressures due to the use of metal wicks. They can start up at any time under almost any condition. CPLs, on the other hand, require a lengthy pre-conditioning period before they commence the loop operation. However, CPLs provide tight temperature control for the heat source which is a desirable characteristic of a spacecraft thermal control system (TCS). In addition, the ability of the CPLs to acquire heat from multiple heat sources and share the heat among them allows the design of the spacecraft TCS to be simpler and lightweight. An advanced concept of LHP (A-LHP) combines a LHP and CPL into one loop. The LHP/CPL hybrid loop inherits all operational attributes of the LHP and yet does not show any disadvantages associated with either a LHP or CPL. A miniature version of the A-LHP can be used effectively in next generation spacecraft.",

No other existing passive heat transport technology is able to accommodate this requirement. The benefits of this technology'scapabilities are: reduced gimbal mass and volume for better pointing agility, reduced cooler induced jitter for better image stabilization, optimum cooler placement next to heat rejection surfaces, easier implementation of cryocooler redundancy, moreadaptable cryogenic system integration architecture, and lighter, more compact, lower power gimbaled spacecraft architectures. The Phase I effort will demonstrate the feasibility of the technology through development, design, build, and test of a prototypeA-CLHP.

In Phase I, such an injector was designed for supplying 100mAmps of 10 MeV electrons suitable for acceleration in an Free Electron Laser driver linac.  Beam performance was modeled to ensure that a robust design was achieved.  A detailed design of the major innovative components that drive overall performance and cost was developed.   In Phase II, a prototype of the Phase I design will be fabricated and assembled to demonstrate the critical technologies.  The construction of the superconducting photonjector, designed in Phase I, will include the development and construction of three new superconducting rf structures, a novel cryostat design, and a cathode chamber.  When completed, the injector will deliver an electron beam for characterization and measurement.

This proposal follows a successful Phase I in which the        26 pound merlinchair, a glass filled nylon prototype, passed the double drum         and curb drop ANSI fatigue durability tests. Turbo has assembled a strong team       in plastics, medical devices, wheelchair and computer technology with broad          base knowledge, cross over experience and a solid track record for producing         products. In Phase II we will: design and fabricate preproduction tooling,           develop molding processes, assemble and test preproduction wheelchairs. Diverse      users will ride, and caretakers will push the post Phase I modified prototype        chairs and evaluate them. From user reports SFSU will guide further                  refinements. We expect at least two separate chair configurations to result.         Contract molding, in house assembly, testing and more evaluation by the              users/caretakers group will provide data for final design parameter& TWC will        fabricate 200 preproduction chairs for Phase III institutional and user              distribution and for attracting capital necessaiy for producing Merlinchairs.        Users and advocates have begged for chairs with MerlinChairs' attributes. TWC        anticipate that Merlinchair will be widely used and accepted.                          PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The North American wheelchair market exceeds $650 million in annual sales. Manual chairs account for just under one-half the dollar volume. In phase III TURBO Wheelchair will capture approximately 6-10% ($20-32.5million) of the manual chair market within 5years on the basis of a durable, folding solid seat, affordable engineering resin based product.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Verbatim from the Applicant's Abstract): Compartment Syndrome (CS)      is a condition of high tissue pressure causing ischemia damaging muscles and         nerves. It is known that in highly non-compliant tissues a small fluid volume        decrease can produce a large pressure drop, and thereby increase perfusion and       improve circulation and oxygenation. During Phase I, we demonstrated                 feasibility of an innovative use of tissue ultrafiltration (UF) to reduce            tissue pressure by removing interstitial and/or intracellular fluid volume, and      to use the increased fluid levels of metabolites to improve diagnosis. 77'e          central hypothesis is that UF catheters in muscle compartments can be used to        improve functional outcome in CS, by improving diagnosis and reducing                intramuscular pressure. In Phase II, bench, animal and human studies have been       designed to further develop UF as a clinical tool. Patients will not be placed       at higher risk of CS sequelae since UF has limited invasiveness, a history of        safety as an assay tool, and does not pre-empt eventual fasciotomy should            clinical signs and symptoms warrant. Our expectation is that clinical                application of CSUF will provide earlier diagnosis, less morbid treatment, and       will prevent sequelae of untreated CS. Expected US healthcare cost savings from      the use of CSUF are $200 million per year.     PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Not Available",

Foam core steel sandwich panels, based on Fraunhofer Institute technology, were successfully demonstrated in subscale during Phase I. The process path ofHIP plus foaming and HIP plus deformation (rolling) and foaming produced panels superior to all other steel foam process methodologies thus far explored. The following issues were identified for further effort, understanding, and improvement in Phase II:Improvement in pore size distribution, improved theoretical understanding of the mechanism of steel foaming, foam demonstration and scale-up of steel foam panels via a HIP plus roll plus foam approach and fabrication of a protoype naval vessel door withBath iron Works.   The properties of steel foams and steel foam sandwiches suggest numerous potential applications in advanced ship designs: o Hulls using steel foam sandwiches with steel face sheets o Elevator platforms o Pontoons, docks, buoys,cargo-loading decks, life rafts o Fire doors, bulkheads, partitions, floors, cabin interiors o Lightweight, damage-tolerant rapid-deployment pallets and cargo containers o Blast deflectors and pyrotechnic lockers o Antenna platforms o Deck ramps, hatchcovers, stern gates o Lightweight ladders, scaffolding, and furniture",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The ever-growing concern over air quality has led to considerable legislation to control atmospheric concentrations of ozone, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).  However, much work remains before an acceptable measure ofindoor air quality is adopted.  This is due in part to the lack of universal standards for indoor air quality.  Over the past three decades, the low temperature catalytic oxidation of VOCs has been improved considerably as part of efforts by thetransportation and energy production industries to control emissions produced by combustion of fossil fuels.  However, no existing catalyst technology is known to exhibit a sufficiently high catalytic activity in the critical 0-200 degrees C temperaturerange to accomplish the emission reduction goals of these or other industries.  In Phase I, Ultramet demonstrated the feasibility of a catalytic filtration element comprising low-cost reticulated vitreous carbon or silicon carbide open-cell foam catalystsupports coated with a metal catalyst/mixed metal oxide solid electrolyte, and operating based on the principle of non-Faradaic electrochemical modification of catalytic activity (NEMCA).  In laboratory-scale testing, these filter elements exhibited highcatalytic activity near room temperature and under high face velocity conditions.  In bench-scale testing, these filter elements exhibited long life and compatibility with current heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems.  In Phase II, Ultrametwill scale up and optimize the fabrication of catalytic filtration system, optimize the catalytic efficiency of the system with respect to the selected contaminant(s), and validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the system in pilot-scale applications.This technology offers a significant advance in the state-of-the-art of catalytic control of air- and water-borne contaminants.",

Such oxide films mask the fracture surfaces and make them very difficult, if not impossible, to analyze and/or repair.  Inhibited chemical etchants have been developed to remove oxide films from steels topreserve the base metal during pickling in the manufacturing processes.  No similar process is required during nickel superalloy production, and no such inhibitor has been developed to date.  In Phase I, Ultramet demonstrated the feasibility of utilizingultraviolet- and microwave-assisted chemical vapor deposition processes using activated atomic hydrogen gas near room temperature to rapidly remove the oxide films from superalloy fracture surfaces, producing clean nickel alloy component fracture surfacessuitable for failure analysis, repair, and/or joining (brazing).  In Phase II, Ultramet will work with Williams International, a well-known small turbine manufacturer, to optimize and scale up the oxide removal technology and define specific brazingapproaches for nickel-based superalloys, specifically including MAR-M-247 and Waspaloy superalloys.  Additionally, a mobile, ultraviolet-based oxide removal apparatus will be constructed to demonstrate the versatility, simplicity, and environmentalfriendliness of the process, including suitability for laboratory-scale analysis and field repair.",

In phase II, Ultramet proposes the rapid optimization of this technology for direct integration into aerospace structures currently under development. This goal will be accomplished by teaming with three leading aerospacecompanies, all potential Phase III (commercialization) partners with specific, identified components that will greatly benefit from the proposed technology. The companies, and their components of interest, are the Chemical Systems Division (CSD) of Pratt &Whitney; for solid rocket motor (SRM) throats, the Rocketdyne Division of Boeing North American for lightweight upper-stage nozzles, and Science Applications International Corp.

Using a rabbit model, we have          developed a novel vaginal drug delivery system that takes advantage of the           unique vaginal-to-uterine circulation to achieve therapeutic concentrations of       PSIs in the uterine musculature without high concentrations in the systemic          circulation. This patented delivery system consists of a drug reservoir/carrier      assembly that can be incorporated into a series of unique, tampon-containing         platforms or a vaginal ring and is designed to carry the PSI through the             vaginal mucosa into uterine circulation during menstruation. This innovative         approach will provide effective relief during menses to women who still              experience disabling dysmenorrhea, miss work, or are hampered in their daily         activities, as well as absorb the menses. In addition, this drug delivery            platform can be modified for delivery of other compounds to treat preterm labor      and endometriosis.  PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: NOT AVAILABLE",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop an optimized prototype of the UNCOPIER-a chemical-free, energy-efficient, ACIM-based device designed to non-destructively deink laser-xerographic prints one sheet at a time. Acoustic Coaxing Induced Microcavitation (ACIM) is a novel, chemical-free, and energy-efficient process which uses only \"Silent Sound and Clean Water.\" Underlying ACIM's energy efficiency is microcavitation's ability to concentrate an enormous amount of energy on an extremely small (i.e. sub-microscopic) point. These controlled concentrations of energy result in nearly spontaneous cleaning which does not hurt the substrate. ACIM is the ideal technology for deploying energy exactly at the point of use. UNCOPIER technology will revolutionize the paper recycling industry in a number of ways, as well as innovation in the recycling process itself. Since the UNCOPIER leaves the deInked paper immaculately white and undamaged, it will save environmental resources by making it possible to manufacture new print grade paper from the recycled laser-xerographic prints. The UNCOPIER is being developed as an office machine to advocate a pioneer method for recycling paper-at-source deinking, \"one sheet at a time.\" DeInking paper prior to recycling protects confidentiality. This novel approach will appeal to banks, hospitals, law firms, government agencies, and other institutions interested in recycling, but also concerned with safeguarding confidentiality. The UNCOPIER system will reduce recycling costs and enables vital commercial motivations for its improved recycling endeavors.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Hybrid electric vehicle technology has proven to be an effective method of reducing fuel consumption and improving the overall efficiency of any given vehicle.  The benefits of hybrid technology are extremely valuable to the military, where vehicle rangeand fuel logistics have become of the utmost importance.  Perhaps the main drawback to hybrid electric vehicles lies in their high levels of electromagnetic radiation.  UQM Technologies, Inc. has years of experience in the development of hybrid and pureelectric vehicles.  Our focus in on high efficiency, brushless, permanent magnet drive trains specifically designed for these vehicles.  In recent years UQM has begun a program to evaluate the EMI problems in our oun drive systems.  We have acquired thetest equipment needed for EMI diagnostics and identified the source(s) of EMI in some of our own drive train products.  Phase I endeavors gave us the opportunity to research and develop new technologies that serve to decrease EMI without sacrificingefficiency.  Some of those EMI reductions parameters included Space-Vector Modulation (effectively produces waveforms closer to Sinusoidal, without compromising efficiency), Concentric Motor Lead Cable (cancels fields around the outside of the cable),Enclosures with Positive Permeability, EMI gaskets and EMI Filters.  All of these parameters have been proved to reduce EMI in our system to varying degrees, resulting in a system that has much reduced radiated emissions from the baseline system.  Phase IIwill refine those parameters into a commercially viable, EMI reduced drive system, allowing the parent vehicle to pass all applicable standards relating to electromagnetic radiated emissions.",

Efforts will be focused ondesign optimization based on inverter performance, modeling, and experimental testing. Digital signal processing controller will be used for effective and efficient control of a variable speed induction motor. High ambient temperature testing of theinverter will be carried out so that the high temperature capability of the SiC inverter can be demonstrated. Power module design, noise-immune gate drive development, high frequency operation, inverter efficiency, and inverter cooling will be the keyissues studied in Phase II.

        "abstract": "Abstract         UTD proposes to develop a low reaction force drilling system for use on micro-gravity environments based on UTD's patented Helical Drag Bit technology. The Helical Drag Bit is unique in that it self advances into the hole, and thus does not require a large reaction force. Drilling into the Martian surface will enable measurements essential to answer questions regarding that planet's geologic, hydrologic and climatic evolution. By enabling the quantification of subsurface geochemical environment, UTD's drilling system will permit scientists to answer diverse global questions, such as the chemical nature of the mantle and the details of diurnal and seasonal gas exchange between the atmosphere and the regolith. Although the intended primary target for this device is Mars, it can also be used to explore other planetary bodies for water and organics. Subsurface drilling technology developed under this SBIR will be directly applicable to NASA's Martian Surveyor missions as well as any future Lunar and outer Solar System missions. Generating the theoretical and empirical knowledge now will enable the future technological breakthroughs necessary to drill much deeper during later missions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):The Phase I study of genes overexpressed in      bladder tumors compared to normal tissue has yielded several candidates, of          which the most promising is the novel gene product, C35. This gene product is        overexpressed in 30 percent of primary bladder tumors as well as 70 percent of       primary human breast tumors. Human CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes can be induced       that lyse both bladder and breast tumor cells that overexpress C35, but that do      not lyse normal C35 negative cells. This indicates that immune tolerance to          overexpressed C35 will probably not be an obstacle to vaccination for cancer         therapy. A C35-specific monoclonal antibody has been generated and used to           determine that C35 is a surface membrane protein that appears to transduce a         negative growth signal to the tumor following crosslinking by purified               monoclonal antibody. Pre-clinical evaluation of therapeutic applications of C35      vaccines and specific antibody are facilitated by the identification of a            murine homologue of C35 that is also overexpressed in some murine tumors. The        human C35 specific 2C3 monoclonal antibody is also crossreactive with murine         C35 and can, therefore, be tested for clinical benefit alone or in conjunction       with vaccination or chemotherapy in this animal model.  PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: This research is directed at developing diagnostics and vaccines specific for bladder  and breast cancer.",

Only 1% of the nation's children meet all the Food Guide Pyramid nutritional recommendations. Fifty-one percent of the nation's children meet all the Food Guide Pyramid nutritional recommendations. Fifty-one percent of children and adolescents eat less than one serving of fruit a day, and 29% eat less than one serving a day of vegetables that are not fried. Diet is a known risk factor for the three leading causes of death -- heart disease, cancer, and stroke -- as well as for diabetes, high blood pressure, and osteoporosis. The objective of this study is to develop and field test a full-scale interactive, multimedia nutrition education resource that combines CD-ROM and Internet technologies to provide teachers lessons in four subjects -- science, math, language arts and social studies -- that can be integrated into existing fourth grade curriculum. The project will develop 50 lessons and related instructional resources and field test them with a sample of 480 students in 24 classrooms in ten different schools. The study employs a pre-test/post-test experimental research design to determine the extent to which the nutrition education CD-ROM increases students nutritional knowledge and improves the food choices of students toward a healthier diet.",

Expected hydrogen yield is 1.7 liters per gram of reactants,representing 2.6 Wh per gram of reacting materials, computed by Army guidelines.An integrated hydrogen source package producing 300 Wh to 1000 Wh will have apackaged energy density of between 1.1 Wh and 1.6 Wh per gram of system weight.The hydrogen source will include an ammonia tank, reactor with a heating elementand AlH3 block, a control block, and tubing and passive valve arrangement.  Thispackage will also include a special filter, which can absorb 20% of its mass inimpurities such as NH3, and reduce them to less than 1 ppm.

The smart cartridge concept contains a dense consolidated propellant charge and an electronicallycontrolled smart primer to govern the ignition of various portions of the propellant bed.  Phase I interior ballistic simulations have shown that performance improvements well over 20% are possible with this propulsion concept.This effort will experimentally evaluate the technical feasibility of the Phase I concept that was demonstrated using computer simulations.  The proposed Basic Phase II Work Plan contains experimental tasks to confirm SCC concept viability at the 40mmscale.  This caliber was selected because it is large enough to contain all of the features of a full scale charge and small enough to realize significant cost and time savings per test.  These cost savings can be translated into a more comprehensive testplan to thoroughly investigate and understand SCC design issues and lead to efficient Phase III full scale development.In addition to experimental development, the Basic Phase II effort will expand the simulation work begun during Phase I.  The NGEN code will be included with the IBHVG2 and XKTC codes to add a two-dimensional simulation capability for increased realism.Analyses will be performed to support the 40mm experimental work and the experimental results will be used to upgrade the predictive capability of the codes.  Another simulation effort will be directed toward transition to the Phase III full scaleapplication.",

This technology will have immediate benefits in the MARITECH ASE major initiative areas of Shipyard Production, Systems Technologies (simulation),and Facilities and Tooling.  The process (using randomly acquired handheld photography) allows for highly accurate 3D measurements and 3D models(scene reconstruction) to be extracted from digital photography with no field targeting of points of interest.  High accuracy (and automated element extraction)is obtained through the integration of extensive image processing capabilities.  Technical objectives for Phase II include supporting the common shipbuilding applications of Run-To-Suit Pipe Modeling, Construction Verification, andDimensional Control Feedback.

        "abstract": "Abstract         Interferometric SAR techniques have been successfully demonstrated to be able to locate pixel scattering centers in three dimensions: however the relative location within a scattering volume does not provide further information that can be used to makemeasurements. Similarly polarimetric techniques allow scattering behavior to be determined averaged over the entire volume. However, by the use of a fully polarimetric and interferometric SAR system, there is the potential to determine the differentscattering mechanisms within a volume as well as their locations (x, y, z). During our phase I effort we successfully applied polarimetric interferometry techniques to FOPEN SAR imagery to estimate the tree heights and bald earth topography over forestedareas. During phase II, these algorithms will be extended to allow for estimation of the canopy density as well as a more reliable estimate of the current parameters. This will be accomplished through the development of improved vegetation models, the useof multifrequency information present in the UWB UHF data, and the use of multiple repeat pass baselines. A set of software modules for performing terrain characterization using data from the DARPA FOPEN sensor will be developed for use in batch mode aswell as interactively by a user.",

DCREO consists of optimized security and adaptive presentation methods thatwhen combined, will expend 20X fewer resources, but yet still provide highly scalable fortress-like security mechanisms and high quality profile-tailored visual-rich presentation to users carrying resource constrained mobile wireless devices (i.e., deviceswith small screens and limited CPU, battery, memory and bandwidth capacity). These optimized security and adaptive presentation methods are managed and controlled by novel proprietary DCREO functions that dynamically direct the implementation of specificsecurity and presentation techniques to most efficiently minimize the use of constrained resources while most effectively maximizing presentation speed and information assurance in light of resource availability, presentation speed needs and securityrequirements. Therefore, the objective of this Phase II project is to develop and demonstrate a new, advanced, superior dynamic wireless information assurance and adaptive processing presentation technology called Real-time Mobile-wireless VPN (RMV). RMVis based on IPSec VPNs and DCREO. The RMV product line is to be implemented as highly optimized processing and control software designed to run on server and client, general and special purpose, processors.",

The major problem that has forestalled the full exploitation of thisfrequency band is the lack of convenient and reliable terahertz transmitters and receivers. Previous research has shown that GaAs diode technology can be used for terahertz Transmit/Receive (T/R) modules, but the cost is prohibitive, the reliability ispoor and the frequency agility is limited. Phase I research has demonstrated that these limitations can be overcome through the use of highly integrated GaAs-on-dielectric circuits and modern computer aided design tools. The prototypes demonstrated inPhase I have shown that component integration can vastly improve performance and greatly reduce costs.Phase II research will focus on the implementation of this technology for the development of a new generation of frequency sources and receivers that will allow the terahertz band to be fully exploited for military, scientific and commercial applications.",

Specific aims are: 1) Design a virtual reality (VR) scenario for children with autism that will teach appropriate behavior in a restaurant; 2) Incorporate this design into an interactive computer program using animated characters and videos demonstrating similar real world social situations; 3) Demonstrate the efficacy of the instructional software through use of applied behavior analysis and single subjects design. The learning environment afforded by video enhanced VR may help individuals with autism master difficult social skills by providing individualized practice in controllable, non-threatening worlds. The research design and methods for achieving these goals are: 1) Choose children who have been diagnosed with autism; 2) Design, program, and debug a PC based VR restaurant environment and appropriate video scenarios; 3) Conduct trials to evaluate the results using n, multiple baselines across subjects design. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Virtual reality learning environments would have a broad market appeal for children, parents, teachers. and health practitioners for teaching social behavior to children with autism and related learning disabilities. A present company web site provides products for autism language and safety skills, allowing an in-place cost effective delivery and support system for this new product.",

ISSODA consists of a suite of fully integrated passive sensors and an obstacle detection and avoidance software package applicablefor a variety of military and civilian tasks.  The sensor suite consists of a triple CCD cameras for accurate 3D computation, a color video camera for obstacle detection, classification, and motion detection, a stereo FLIR sensors to allow operations inlow-visibility environment.  The software contains two major components, depth computation, obstacle detection and avoidance.  The depth computation component consists of three algorithms, trinocular stereo vision, motion+stereo, and a fast stereoprocessor.  The trinocular stereo vision and motion+stereo algorithms attempt to reduce stereo vision error and increase the accuracy of range data.  The obstacle detection and avoidance component consists algorithms for color clustering, computing depthvariance and motion variance, texture segmentation, moving obstacle detection, and a neural network classifier.  ISSODA will be designed in such a way that its constituent parts (the various sensors, and algorithms) are all easily interchangeable.  ISSODAwill be a fully integrated system ready to be mounted on a mobile robot for sensing obstacles, sending warning signals, or generating a 3D grid map with obstacles marked and elevated.",

To date, there is nomethod of characterizing the expected performance of a simulation as these conditions vary.  The purpose of this effort is to develop a system that will automatically generate such characterizations.  Once a simulation has been characterized, the systemcan also be used to provide confidence limits on the validity of the representations provided under the specific operating conditions of any simulation run.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION: Many older adults experience declines in sensory and cognitive          function, resulting in increased difficulty with everyday activities. One            activity, crucial to maintaining independence, is driving. Mobility is critical      for social contacts and a satisfying quality of life, and mobility loss              frequently results in need for formal care. Therefore, effective methods for         extending safe mobility could have far-reaching consequences. The focus of the       proposed research is to evaluate the effectiveness of a home-based intervention      program to enhance the cognitive functions needed to drive safely, and to            perform other instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). Prior work has        resulted in a laboratory based training program, which is currently used by          employers, Departments of Motor Vehicles, and many health care professionals.        This program is used for both driver screening and to provide cognitive              training to improve the skills needed for safe mobility. The Phase I                 application demonstrated the feasibility for a home based intervention, and          Phase II aims to produce the videotapes and examine their effectiveness              relative to the laboratory based training program. This product, if                  demonstrated to be effective, would provide a low cost, convenient means for         distributing this intervention to a broader segment of the population than           would otherwise be served.

        "abstract": "Abstract         NASA has a critical need to automate the identification and classification of features in Earth Science imagery, particularly new high-resolution imagery. In addition, commercial applications of Earth Science data as well as the viability of the remote sensing industry depend on the development of new tools for accelerated classification of remotely sensed images. Previous research by others to automate analysis of remote sensing data through development of feature extraction software has met with limited success. The proposed research involves a new automated feature extraction approach that uses innovative machine-learning algorithms and techniques, including neural network ensembles and foveal vision. Visual Learning Systems (VLS) proposes to demonstrate the technical feasibility of this approach for rapid extraction of features from a wide variety of high-resolution digital images. This Phase I research is expected to result in technology advances that will successfully demonstrate the feasibility of VLS's innovative machine-learning system for automated feature classification from diverse high-resolution multispectral, hyperspectral, and radar image data sets from leading satellite and airborne sensors. These results will establish a solid foundation for further research during Phase II that will lead to a fully operational automated feature classification system ready for subsequent commercial development.",

The software will enable the user to set individual parameter values using interactive controls that will update the plot of the associated data values 'on the fly'. This technology will allow scientists who perform parametric design analysis to quickly understand the impact that each parameter has on the overall performance of the design. It will replace the current tedious method for studying parametric changes which consists of trying to visually compare a series of several individual plots.The software will be designed to facilitate rapid continued development, cross-platform consistency and compatibility with larger, more comprehensive software systems such as a collaborative, web-based engineering environment. This flexible design approach will lead to the development a state-of-the-art visualization system which will maintain steady growth to serve increasing numbers of applications areas and to take full advantage of rapidly-changing computing environments.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The need exists to generate high fidelity electromagnetic planewave environments over large assets for the purpose of testing avionics systems on full-size aircraft in anechoic chambers.  In the Phase I effort, we conducted simulations of a PlanewaveGenerator (PWG) architecture that used a genetic algorithm to determine an excitation vector for a phased array that in turn creates an incident field that is planewave in nature only over local points in space.  The simulations showed that the PWG couldproduce planewave-like fields with exceptionally high fidelity over multiple wavelength-sized aperatures.  We further demonstrated that the PWG produces high fidelity fields in the presence of distance measurement error and electrical noise.   The PWGsystem was shown capable of simulating the arrival of planewaves over a cone exceeding +/-10 degrees, as well as being capable of projecting multiple planewave-like regions.  In addition to the simulations, we presented a comprehensive hardware design forthe PWG system.  In the proposed Phase II effort, we will develop the software and hardware components of the PWG and demonstrate its operation and capability.  The system software will provide an extensive graphical interface that will permit the user toeasily specify the test configuration, compute the phased array excitation vector, simulate the display the resulting radiating field, control the hardware components, and aid in the calibration and operation of the PWG.  The hardware will consist of onePWG substation array.  It will be capable of operating independently, or together with additional substation arrays, according to the problem specification and setup.  The goals are to realize a system that will create planewave simulation over 10 lambda x10 lambda regions with angle of arrival simulation capability of +/- 5 degrees (or greater).",

New high sensitivity, high speed photodetectors operating  from 1.0 to 1.6 microns are needed for both military and commercial  applications. New research has demonstrated APD structures, which use a Si  multiplication region and an InGaAs absorption region. This device shows  high sensitivity, very high speed, low noise and high temperature and  voltage stability. However, the developed for high speed 1540 nm optical  fiber communication, specifically high GB product, these APDs have high  dark current (dark count) and low gain (10-20) and are not suited for  lower speed photon counting applications. Our Phase I research identified  new detector architectures suitable for photon counting:. These detectors  provide high internal gain (50-500) and low dark current. The high gain  can be achieved at relatively low bias (below breakdown) such that photon  counting is possible without passive or active quenching. On Phase II, we  propose to fabricate the NIR photodiodes and monolithically integrate  these detectors with low noise CMOS readouts by a new epitaxial layer  process and calibrate the detectors at NIST facilities.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The ever-growing demand for higher computing bandwidth in both military and civilian applications has pushed signal speed into the tens of GHz frequency range, thus requiring fast optical digitizers.  WaveBand Corporation proposes to develop a new lowtiming-jitter monolithic semiconductor mode-locked laser.  The specially designed two-section laser will serve as a stable clock in a high-speed sampler for optical analog-to-digital (A/D) converters.  It will be hybridly mode-locked.  A saturable absorberwill generate short pulses and an external oscillator (modulating the laser with microwave signal close to its cavity repetition rate) will improve its timing performance.  Moreover, the pulse-to-pulse repetition time between neighboring pulses will becorrelated to provide stability over long time periods.  In Phase I of this project we analyzed the statistics of timing jitter and demonstrated sub femtosecond pulse-to-pulse rms timing jitter in actively mode-locked semiconductor laser.  Phase II willresult in the demonstration of a complete stable optical sampler based on the proposed hybridly mode-locked semiconductor laser.",

With a target price of 5,000 dollars, the system design fits within the AGATE goal of a 100,000-dollar aircraft. The system will make use of WaveBand's slim profile scanning millimeter wave antenna, low cost radar components derived from the automotive industry and low cost processor derived from Marconi Astronics (formerly Lear Astronics Corporation) ALG. The system will display images on a low cost HUD, such as that under development by Crew Systems.Toward the stated objective, WaveBand, using its existing relationship with Marconi Astronics will analyze the operational scenario, develop system requirements and specifications, design a system to be demonstrated in Phase II, look at installation and certification issues, and estimate system production costs. Once implemented the proposed system will greatly advance the utility and safety of general aviation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         We propose to utilize the multimedia and hypertext capabilities of the World Wide Web to develop a complete, comprehensive set of resources to facilitate multi- university, interdisciplinary collaborative research dealing with any of the Complex Genetic Disorders. In order to develop these resources, a virtual private research network will be developed for one representative complex genetic disorder, namely, autism. Accordingly, this application encompasses the development of a Web-based Virtual Private Research Network for Genetic Studies of Autism (VPRN-GA) that will represent the collaborative endeavors of WebSciences and the currently constituted multi-institutional Collaborative Linkage Study of Autism (CLSA) which includes investigators at Tufts, Vanderbilt, the University of Iowa and Duke. Further expansion of the network may include eight other funded groups who are just beginning a collaboration on autism genetics via an R-13 Conference Grant (two via NIMH, and others via NINDS, NICHD, a private foundation, the Canadian MRC, a French/Swedish organization, and the British MRC and NICHD). This Phase I application focuses on developing static Web page templates for the organization and flow of information dealing with the online submission, review, discussion, evaluation, manipulation, etc., of data and documents (manuscripts); in addition, online communication and bibliographic services for the VPRN-GA will be developed. The VPRN-GA will be evaluated originally by the CLSA investigators, who will function as users/beta-testers. On the basis of the preceding, the accompanying Fast- Track Phase II application will provide for the transformation of static Web pages to a database-driven, fully functional VPRN-GA on the World Wide Web. Also included in the Phase II application is a comprehensive plan for commercialization of the software responsible for the VPRN-GA. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: We anticipate that the primary commercial contribution to sustain the VPRN-GA will arise from the sale of the software that provides for an integrated set of functionalities for collaborative research on autism, complex genetic disorders, molecular biology, etc. Certain of these functionalities will be marketed as individual components, for example, the submission, review and evaluation of molecular biological images on the Web and collaborative interactions associated with these images. Additional revenue will come from sponsorships and advertising. A description of the potential sources of funding support are presented in the Phase II Appendix: Product Development Plan.",

Conventional test methods formaterials and oils have insufficient linkage to service performance and mechanisms that control life and durability.  The recognition of the current state of affairs and the need for a cultural change in the industry for material, oil and componentdeveloped was highlighted in a two-day workshop with industry leaders during Phase I.  If suface technologies and oil formulations are developed as a contact system (tribo-system) with a highly flexible and science-based testing capability currently beingdeveloped, significant performance gains can be realized.  Tribology data generated with preliminary test methods during Phase I show the potential of the approach.  Phase I has resulted in two new projects with these test methods to identify urgentlyneeded material/oil performance limits.  A going forward plan is proposed to link testing to service performance and to provide guidance for innovative surface technologies and oil formulation.  An empirical approach to tribo-system performance modeling isproposed to provide a realistic input to engine component life and durability models.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         60162         The detection and discrimination of seismic events, while monitoring for small nuclear explosions, is complicated by a significant amount of mining explosions.  Complex source and propagation modeling efforts are needed to explain observational datasets of short-period surface wave generation from different types of mining and chemical explosions.  This project will develop a modeling package that considers complex source models for different types of explosions and propagates explosion generated surface waves through realistic three-dimensional (3D) structures.  In Phase I, a database was assembled that is unique in its content of local and regional recordings of various classifications of explosions.  Source information, and in some cases videographic data from mining and chemical explosions, was obtained to help ascertain the physical processes at work during the explosions.  Velocity models and attenuation values for the upper crust in the study regions were determined and will be used during the Phase II modeling study.  The evidence suggests that blast discriminants can be developed from a combination of empirical and modeling efforts.  Phase II will collect local and close-in data from fragmentation explosions for which a gap exists in the current database, develop a modeling package that ports different explosion source models with complicated 3D full waveform synthesis at regional distances, and compare model generated results with empirical data to develop mine blast discriminants.                  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The modeling package should be useful in the synthesis of surface waves from explosions by seismological organizations.  In particular, the discriminants developed would provide a tool for separating commercial mining explosions from nuclear explosions and natural seismicity.  The modeling package could also have commercial applications in the mining industry to aid blasters in the design of mining explosions with high efficiency and minimal vibrational effects",

As information, manipulation, storage and transmittal becomes more time dependent, whether the need is for the coordination ofinformation warfare systems, the protection of the national infrastructure, or the integrity of e-commerce operations, the problem remains the same. We need accurate and trusted time. A large number of diverse areas, such as automated data recordingsystems, computer-controlled systems, computer networks, air traffic control, radio astronomy, broadcasts, geodesy, and radio and TV networks, also depend on accurate time. In addition, many applications require not only accurate time, but also reliabletime stamps to be used as legal evidence that digital data existed at a given time. In other words, an electronic document must be stamped by a trusted time source.Under this effort WetStone Technologies will be advancing the state-of-the-art by first developing a FIPS certified Time Stamp Authority (TSA) that will integrate into a global trusted time infrastructure.  The TSA is targeted for integration into militarydefensive information warfare infrastructures and a wide range of commercial e-commerce applications.",

This proposal describes development of a telemetry         system capable of providing the bi-directional communications between implanted      and external components required for safe operation.                                                                                                                      The ECG signal is a naturally occurring form of telemetry. The voltages sensed       by the ECG machine are the result of minute electrical currents generated by         the heart flowing through the resistances of the tissues in the thorax. In           similar fashion, the Conductance Telemetry System (CTS) transmitter admits           minute high frequency currents into tissues via one pair of electrodes               producing voltages that can be detected by a remote receiver connected to a          second pair of external electrodes. A telemetry system based on this principle       will be highly resistant to interruptions of service if issues pertaining to         its reliance on chronic skin electrodes can be adequately addressed.                                                                                                      The goals of this program are to: 1) develop custom electronic components that       make it easy to integrate the CTS into a host system; 2) develop skin electrode      systems suitable for use in VAS and TAH patients, and, 3) obtain third party         certification of compliance with safety standards.                                   PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  Both the NHLBI and private industry are supporting the devleopment of implantable blood  pumps to address the needs of an estimated 30-40,000 patients annually who might benefit  from permanent mechanical circulatory support.  The proposed device is applicable to   virtually all of these systems.",

The circuit concept developed is for a resonant, regenerative switching piezomotor driveamplifier that would efficiently transfer electrical energy that could be coupled into mechanical work through a piezoelectric actuator. The motor/amplifier system would operate at both electrical and mechanical resonances for the system. The amplifier'sefficiency is estimated to be greater than 80% when driving a 1uF piezoelectric load with a 500 Vpk-pk signal. The available output power should be greater than 10 watts continuously from DC to 2.0 kHz. Once operational, future amplifier refinements canfocus on improved analog computation methodologies, mitigation of alignment and calibration difficulties, while trying to reduce sensitivity to actuator capacitance and improvements to output waveshape fidelity and power delivery. Currently, a prototypeamplifier with +50% power efficiency is undergoing design integration and testing.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Large corporations are increasingly looking to purchase behavioral interventions for employee wellness programs; however, although many interventions have been demonstrated to cost-effectively improve health outcomes, few commercially viable products are available. Hostility and anger expression style have been demonstrated as risk factors for hypertension, itself a risk factor for CHD. Recent research suggests that anger management training reduces blood pressure, and leads to improvement in psychosocial risk factors, e.g., depression. The Williams LifeSkills workshop, based on the book \"Anger Kills\", and its successor, \"Lifeskills\", has shown in pilot studies to improve psychosocial risk factors, and is currently marketed in a limited manner to corporations and government agencies. The marketability of this product, however, would be far greater if supported by extended research demonstrating its effects on blood pressure reduction, as well as showing, in a corporate setting, decreased hostility and depressive symptoms, as well as strong cost-effectiveness, compared with standard care procedures recommended by JNC-VI guidelines. We propose a randomized controlled trial test of the Williams LifeSkills workshop in a hospital setting. We hypothesize that employees who undertake the LifeSkills workshop will show improved blood pressure, psychosocial risk factors, and decreased costs associated with treatment. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Psychosocial risk factors have been strongly related to many health problems, notably CVD. Research has shown that behavioral interventions have great promise to ameliorate the distress, the health- damaging effects and the costs associated with these risk factors; but few such programs have been implemented in a large-scale way. Corporations are increasingly interested in providing such services, but they have had difficulties in knowing which programs are most effective. Until these programs are developed as commercially viable products, dissemination of these programs will be hindered. In sum; these findings make a strong case that the development of a protocol- driven behavioral intervention package that can be delivered in a wide range of corporate settings presents a remarkable commercial opportunity.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the need to improve the success rate at which new technologies can be introduced into the workplace. A methodology and service, ATTAIN(TM), has been conceived to accelerate the integration of technology by rapidly and aggressively identifying critical processes and practices in the organization and shifting them in value-added ways at the level of worker cognition and operational specifics. This method has been shown to be highly successful, but is labor intensive, expensive, and requires highly skilled practitioners. Furthermore, the method upon which ATTAIN is based is not sufficiently targeted. That is, more often than not, businesses have only 3-4 workplace processes or practices that need to be changed in order to increase the company's competitiveness. The original method does not single these out as more important than other elements of the workplace. To date, increasing the effective incorporation of new technology by changing workplace practice and worker cognition through specialized simulation training, but not at identifying the most appropriate target for the technology implementation or change has been very successful. The work of Phase II will involve integrating the current methods with those of another company. Their method has been shown to identify the \"vital few\" practices that mitigate a company's overall competitive survival and which are the most appropriate targets for change. Phase II has two goals. First, a hybrid method that is quicker and more targeted will be developed. Second, a practitioner training approach and supporting materials that make it possible for professionals without extensive experience to deliver the method in a high quality manner will be developed. Training and licensing practitioners in a hybrid method of workplace learning will contribute significantly to the problem of efficient and successful technology integration and implementation of new technologies",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the development of an enabling technology for computer- directed high-throughput screening of proteins with improved properties. Xencor's Protein Design Automation (PDA) predicts all the possible amino acid sequences that will fold into the three-dimensional structure of a protein. There should be molecules among those sequences that have the structure and function of the \"parent \"protein, together with additional novel properties such as increased thermo-stability or alkaline pH optima. In Phase I the company addressed this possibility using xylanase as a model protein. After targeting the active site of the enzyme for PDA re-design, the company found sequences that were more active than the wild-type protein and one that had a different pH profile. These results were achieved by testing only 260 of a possible 110,592 sequences. In Phase II the company will develop a high-throughput assay system that will allow testing the majority of the predicted sequences. The research will also improve electrostatic functions of the PDA algorithm, and then use this version of the program to re-design the entire xylanase molecule instead of just the active site, thereby finding mutations located away from the active site that effect the protein's characteristics. The PDA technology improves enzyme efficiency and expands the reactions and process conditions where they can be applied. Major markets include polymer manufacturers, value extraction from waste streams and food processing",

Emission rates at or  below 0.001 a/cm2/hr are desirable, which is well below the 0.0050  a/cm2/hr capability of today's best detectors. We have developed an active  background suppression scheme that dramatically improves the performance  of a gas-filled parallel plate chamber, yielding a sensitivity of 0.00017  a/cm2/hr. In Phase 2, we propose to design and build a prototype  commercial detector using this scheme to achieve a sensitivity of  0.00005-0.0001 a/cm2/hr. To achieve this goal, we will improve both our  background suppression scheme and the instrumentation on the detector.  Phase 3 development would then be carried out at XIA to produce a  marketable commercial detector.",

The          microspheres are uniform in size and chemistry, and the timed-bioresorption          characteristics can be predetermined according to the isotope half-life and the      dosimetry requirements. A dependable commercial supply of Y-90 glass                 microspheres will have a positive impact on localized radiation therapy              worldwide. This Phase II research has the objective of making such a supply a        commercial reality. The proposed microfabrication process can be streamlined         and fully automated from Y-90 isotope extraction to packaged Y-90 microspheres       ready for delivery and treatment injection. The microsphere production process       will be optimized with regard to minimized personnel radiation exposure,             maximized use of source radioisotopes, much shortened overall process time to        preserve radioactivity, and above all, much reduced cost. Microspheres               containing therapeutic concentrations of radioisotopes will be evaluated in          vitro for radioactivity retention, biocompatibility, and completeness of             bioresorption; and in vivo to demonstrate the efficacy of the Y-90 microspheres      in treating tumor-bearing rodents.   PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS:  Timed-bioresorbable glass microspheres containing Y-90 are ideal for direct intratumoral  injection in the treatment of cancers such as the liver, pancreas, or the synovectomy of  rheumatoid arthritis. Microspheres containing other radioactive isotopes such as P-32 can also  be readily produced by the methods described.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will meet the demand from the microelectronics industry for an improved micro x-ray fluorescence instrument for thin film measurements. A new technique, monochromatic micro x-ray fluorescence (MMXRF) analysis using doubly curved crystal optics can meet this significant market need. A toroidal crystal can focus characteristic x-rays from a microfocus x-ray source based upon diffraction. The focused beam is monochromatic and the beam size is expected to be significantly smaller than that of current MXRF systems. This technique will provide high sensitivity and enhance excitation of low Z elements with the selection of beam energy. In addition, this technique will significantly increase the speed of high-energy x-ray measurements. A prototype MMXRF system will be developed that incorporates a modular dual beam system to probe samples with two energies simultaneously. The initial application of the technology is in the area of semiconductor manufacturing. As semiconductor manufacturing moves to larger wafers and higher levels of integration, a single wafer may require hundreds of steps. These wafers are expensive to produce and very difficult to repair. The instrument under development would provide elemental and thickness analysis to identify defective thin film deposition at the earliest opportunity, avoiding the considerable loss associated with rejections at the end of the production line",

In-situ applications are difficult because such systems are bulky, heavy-weight, power-consuming, and difficult to maintain.  This project will develop a prototype polycapillary-based microbeam XRF (MXRF) sensor system for the remote monitoring of hazardous materials at DOE sites.  The use of a polycapillary focusing optic will significantly increase the X-ray beam intensity and therefore the detection sensitivity of the system.  In Phase I, a polycapillary focusing optic was coupled with a low-powered microfocus x-ray source to generate an x-ray beam of 30 m, yielding a flux density more than three orders of magnitude higher than that obtained with a pinhole collimator.  Various types of samples were analyzed using a polycapillary-based MXRF setup.  Significant improvement in detection sensitivity was achieved on air particulate and water samples.  In Phase II, a prototype polycapillary-based MXRF system will be designed and built.  System performance will be evaluated by examining various samples.  The MXRF sensor will be combined with a dedicated sample handling system to build a compact remote air monitoring system.               Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The proposed system could be used for ex-situ and in-situ analysis and remote monitoring of hazardous materials in air, ground water, and soils at DOE sites.

        "abstract": "Abstract         This SBIR Phase II project will significantly improve the quality of  elemental analysis in SEMS under partial pressure conditions by using a  polycapillary x-ray optic in front of the energy dispersive spectrometer  (EDS) in low-vacuum scanning electron microscopes (LV-SEM) or  environmental SEMs (ESEM). LV-SEMS and ESEMs are designed to work at  elevated sample chamber pressures to allow analysis of nonconductive or  moist specimens. An undesirable consequence results from the broadening  electron beam due to the presence of the gas. This degrades the  elemental-detection sensitivity, because the fluorescent x rays generated  far from the center of the electron probe create high background. It also  greatly reduces spatial resolution for elemental mapping. The Phase I  results have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed  approach. In the Phase II, a fully-functional prototype polycapillary  optic-based EDS will be built and demonstrated in a commercial LV-SEM  system. This will include an optimized polycapillary x-ray optic with a  large collecting angle, optic detector mounting, detector-SEM mounting  which provides fine alignment, an operating procedure, and examples of  application data. The team involved world leaders in developing and  commercially providing x-ray optics and EDS systems.",

We propose to apply this strategy to the detection of Salmonella using an integrated platform that will accommodate high throughput, yet with simple methods that do not require a sophisticated laboratory or highly trained personnel. Salmonella is currently monitors by the FSIS as a measure of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) plan effectiveness. Our goal is to obtain accurate and sensitive results within a given days work shift.

The Y2 Ultra-Filter Technology will offer the advantages of lower power consumption, reduced maintenance, lower cost, and most importantly, reduced logistic and resupply costs compared to existing Air Revitalization Systems for the International Space Station. Furthermore, by applying special bacteria-killing coatings currently available, the Y2 Ultra-Filter Technology has the potential to capture and kill bacteria. This system not only has the potential to allow astronauts to work in a cleaner, safer environment, but could set the standard for a wide range of future commercial and defense applications. Y2 Ultra-Filter, Inc. has already performed substantial testing and has done extensive research to gain confidence in the Technology. Under this SBIR, we will develop a product design optimized to meet NASA's hardware and filtration requirements for manned space flight. We will also conduct limited testing and analysis to confirm our claims.",

While theperformance characteristics of Army rechargeable batteries approaches the state-of-the-art relative to available battery technologies, battery capacity, shelf life and high temperature stability are significantly less than primary battery alternatives. Toimprove rechargeable cell chemistry to more closely meet the Army's needs, Yardney Technical Products, Inc. proposes a Phase II SBIR program to develop and demonstrate novel negative electrode materials for Li-ion batteries. In particular, the program willbuild upon past success with tin based anode materials and focus on materials that have the potential to enable the development of rechargeable batteries with significantly improved energy density, shelf life and high temperature stability. Anticipatedbenefits to the Government include longer life rechargeable batteries, facilitating reduction in Army battery costs. Further, a unique rechargeable cell chemistry that offers performance superior to currently available technologies will reduce productioncosts and enable the establishment of new business opportunities for battery manufacturers.",

However, the production of CdZnTe, dominated by the High Pressure Bridgman technique for a decade, has suffered from low-yields (1-4%) and small device sizes (1-3 cm3).  This project will develop an alternative Modified Vertical Bridgman,   CdZnTe crystal growth technique with higher yield and larger-sizes, leading to higher volume detectors which are not available today.  In Phase I, 50 cm3 large-size single CdZnTe crystals were produced with a high yield of over 50%.  The crystals demonstrated an unprecedented mobility-lifetime product for electrons without compromising bulk resistivity.  The pixellated and co-planar grid detectors performed with excellent energy resolutions.  In Phase-II, a 3 diameter growth technique will be developed.                     Commercial Applications and Other Benefit as described by the awardee: These large-size single crystals, coupled with higher yields of CdZnTe single crystals should lower costs and further improve detector performances, especially for high-resolution room temperature radiation detectors with low-cost for national security and nuclear medicine",

        "abstract": "Abstract         60293         Accelerator cells for the Next Linear Collider come in families of 200 different, but similar looking parts with tolerances varying from.5 to 50 microns.  A total of 2,000,000 cells or 10,000 of each type need to be manufactured.  Speed and repeatability associated with automated part handling is essential, and the automated robotic systems must be capable of comparable accuracy and precision.  Some device or technique is also required for storing, transporting, and maintaining the pedigree of each part.   This project will design and build an automated cart and pallets for the transport and inventory of accelerator cells while maintaining their pedigree between the various manufacturing processes.  A vision guided robot will also be designed for transferring the accelerator cells between the carts, pallets, the precision machining center, and the diamond turning machines used for their fabrication.  Phase I explored the problems of handling the soft copper accelerator cells and difficulties associated with the accurate pick and placement of the parts in a precision machining center.  A vision guided robotic system was built for loading and unloading a pallet of accelerator cells for use in a precision machining center.   In Phase II, a smart cart will be built to transport and inventory a family of 200 accelerator cells that have been loaded onto four pallets, identical to the pallet built in Phase I.  The Phase I robot will be retrofitted to load and unload the precision machining center from the smart cart and transfer parts from the same cart into an automated diamond turning machining.              Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee: The type of precision machinery being developed should have applicability in the automotive, aerospace, telecommunication, micro-photonic, and electro-optic industries.  Customers that purchase either a machining center similar or a diamond turning machine should be candidates to purchase the automated part loading and unloading vision guided robotic system.",

This task is particularly challenging as the structural response exhibits both randomness and strong nonlinear features. To achieve the objective, ZONA proposes four major tasks.  The ZONA team will (1)Extend the capabilities of nonlinear MSC/NASTRAN to include two new elements specifically designed for this application and exhibiting improved shear and temperature distribution modeling; (2) Develop reduced order modeling approaches and equivalentlinearization schemes to reduce the computational cost associated with the prediction of the random structural response using the full nonlinear MSC/NASTRAN; (3) Extend the fatigue life prediction technique with the reduced order models; and (4) Establishexpedient design guidelines that can be used in the preliminary design phase. This effort is endorsed by Boeing, Lockheed-Martin and Pratt-Whitney whose support will ensure the success of the proposed project.",

After successfully finishingthe phase-I project, in this phase-II effort, we will concentrate on the whole assault zone marking/lighting system design, calculation/simulation, prototyping, measurement, lab/field test, modification, retest, and give a complete specification for futuremanufacturing and field deploying of the system. Following innovative research will be deeply addressed:  1. Two lighting systems-ground lighting system (GLS) and air lighting system (ALS) will be designed, manufactured and tested. The GLS will usevisible/invisible parabolic/high intensity LED or eye-safe LD with single or double-filament (VIS & INV) to make the active ground marks. The ALS will use above LED/LD to make a common-aperture, variable-focus projector equipped on the Aircraft toilluminate the passive ground marks having LIF, retroreflective paint, tape, or corner cube. Since this kind active/passive lighting/marking system has lightweight, long lifetime and low power consumption, one soldier can deploy and remove the whole systemin a short time.  2. Uncooled LLL CCD, NIR and LIR cameras, wireless communication systems, polarisation filters will be designed, manufactured and tested for the detection of above lighting/marking systems to accurately facilitate the instrument approachunder bad weather condition for safe landing.   Benefits:  The proposed lighting and detecting systems will be useful for lighting, security, IFF, advertisement, surveillance, law enforcement, and non-lethal illumination for crowd control. Boating,automotive, aircraft, and fire fighting industries would utilize high performance and high efficiency situational awareness systems for operating in poor visibility conditions.",

ZyCare, Inc. is developing detailed specifications for the system and is currently coding the software for the system.  One U.S. patent has already been awarded for the CoagCare(TM) System and another is pending.  CoagCare(TM) has two essential components for treatment delivery, the CoagCare(TM) Patient Module (CPM) and the CoagCare(TM) Caregiver Module (CCM) for use by healthcare professionals managing patients.  Software for the CPM and CCM will run on a browser that can be accessed from a variety of platforms with an Internet connection.  During Phase I, formal detailed specifications and software for the CPM and CCM coding will be completed.  We will also develop a specification for special evaluation software for the CPM.  This software, the CPM Professional Assessment System (CPM-PAS), will allow professionals who manage anticoagulation therapy to formally evaluate the interface, content, and decision-making performed by the CPM and assist software engineers in validating the core functions of the CPM during Phase II.  The major milestones we plan to achieve before beginning Phase II are to complete the initial versions of the CPM, CCM and to develop the specification for the CPM-PAS for formal validation of the CoagCare(TM) system.

        "abstract": "Abstract         APPLICANT'S DESCRIPTION: DNA fingerprinting, or profiling, is widely used for paternity cases and criminal investigations (forensics). Current methodologies are cumbersome, expensive and often fail to produce interpretable results. A minor groove binder (MGB) has been developed that greatly enhances the ability of oligonucleotide probes to discriminate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 5' nuclease (Taqman (registered), real time PCR, fluorescence quench release) assay. The goal is to develop a kit for rapid high throughput DNA fingerprinting using probes that contain MGB's and other proprietary modifications. The fingerprint is derived from a panel of 23 diallelic polymorphisms. The probability that two unrelated individuals would have matching fingerprints is approximately 1 in 10 (exp) 8. In the Phase I effort, PCR primers and probes for the 23 loci were optimized and their function was demonstrated in 5' nuclease assays using a set of known DNA samples. The goal of phase II is to develop a commercial prototype with increased throughput and reduced cost. Application of four spectrally separated reporter fluorophores and a novel quencher will enable multiplexed assays. Standard affordable instruments will replace expensive instruments specialized for 5' nuclease assays. The technologies developed herein can be readily applied to assays of any SNP's. Huge potential markets exist for these technologies in clinical diagnostics and pharmacogenomics. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The commercial prototype presented here is a kit for human identification in paternity testing. The technologies developed herein for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) screening could have wide market potentials in a variety of applications including clinical diagnostics and pharmacogenomics.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The purpose of this Phase II SBIR is to develop a portable and completely wireless system that detects, processes, and analyzes muscle activity for remotely monitoring the functional status of an individual. The Personal Status Monitor (PSM) will remotely monitor the use of muscles during the exertion of motor tasks in a continuous and unobstructed fashion. Through pattern recognition of surface electromyographic (EMG) signals, the PSM will provide the caregiver with an objective parametric measure of how physically active their patient has been, such as walling, sitting, personal care, and feeding. The PSM will consist of three components: 1) four wireless EMG sensors, 2) a body worn transceiver (Repeater), and 3) the Base Station, which processes the signals for pattern recognition and feature extraction. The information can be sent to a remote location via telephone lines or the Internet. The specific aims of this program for Phase II are: Aim 1: To continue with Phase I development of the pattern recognition algorithms in patients with stroke; Aim 2: Design and build a working prototype of the hardware and software for the PSM; and Aim 3: Field test the prototype wireless system among stroke patients in the home environment. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The MA will primarily augment clinical service by making the line an effective place for rehabilitation. In addition, the PSM will have direct applicability to the field of ergonomics for work-site assessment, or in sports or recreational activities as a feedback device to facilitate training of skilled movements. Numerous other applications in the field of rehabilitation could include monitoring of drug therapies for tremor or other neuromuscular conditions, or home-exercise compliance. The knowledge base and prototypes developed in this project are directly transferable to other acquisition systems for biological signals recorded from the skin, such as EEGs and EKGs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The Holographic Beam Combiner, HBC, proposed here can be used to combine incoherently the output from N lasers into a single aperture.  It will have an intensity higher than 90% of the sum of the input intensities,  and a brightness that is 0.9N timeshigher than that of the individual input beams. The HBC is based on the storage of multiple holographic gratings in the same spatial location. Using a new material called PDA up to 20 holograms each with a diffraction efficiency greater than 90% can storedin a single location.  The combination process can be cascaded to increase much further the number of beams to be combined.Under the main task proposed here, we will concentrate on using this technology for combining high-power (4W) multimode diode lasers centered around 978 nm, for pumping dual-clad Yb-doped fiber lasers and amplifiers.  Typically, this laser is pumped withlasers at around 915 nm.  However, the pumping efficiency is about a factor of 3 higher at 978.  The constraint at 978 nm is that the pumping bandwidth is only about 6 nm.  If one were to use the blazed grating blazed beam combining, the number of laserscombined would be less than 10, because the wavelength separation between two constituent beams is typically 1 nm.   The key advantage of our approach is that because of sharp Bragg selectivity of thick (few mm) holograms, the wavelength separation caneasily be as small as 0.03 nm.  As such,  up to 200 beams can be combined within the 6 nm bandwidth, using a two stage cascading of HBC's, using a relatively thinner hologram in the second stage.  The result would be a nearly 700 W pump at the highlyefficient band around 978 nm, with a brightness of about 180 times that of each input laser.  Furthermore, we will investigate the use of this approach for combining incoherently the output of many high-power fiber lasers.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The key to producing more confident, real-time, on-wing diagnoses resides in the processing of multisensor data.  Adding expensive new sensors is not the solution, but data fusion is.  Fusion saves cost and weight; no new sensors are required.  Fusionreduces false alarm rates; faults to be seen across multiple sensors.  Diagnostic performance is improved by allowing detection of unique fault patterns seen on sets of sensors instead of a single sensor.  Fusion enables predictive diagnostics; low-levelinformation is integrated across sensors so potential faults can be detected earlier.  In Phase IIAC developed a PC-based gas turbine engine health monitoring system that uses a combination of signal and information processing algorithms to perform data fusion for engine fault diagnostics and predictive diagnostics.  The system is built around anIntelligent Mechanical Diagnostics System (i-mds) Matlab toolbox that aids in systems development of future and in the integration of new sensors and new information.  In Phase II that fusion technology and i-mds will be further developed and included intoan integrated system to support individual aircraft field maintenance, fleet maintenance, as well as research engineers in performing diagnostics and predictive diagnostics on real data.  That development includes significant amounts of real data.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Accurate and timely measurement of the developing environment toxicity is of great importance for general pollution control and for military operations. Biosensors, which are based on a combination of biological sensing element and an electronic signaltransducer, are finding a wide spread use in the environment toxicity measurements. Standard statistical approaches used commonly in the analysis of biosensor data are often not sufficient to detect developing toxicity as the toxicity responses may beobscured by natural changes in the environment and in the biological behavior. In Phase I, IAC demonstrated novel data processing and neural network modeling approaches that produced a significant improvement in the toxicity detection using a fishbiosensor.In Phase II, IAC in collaboration with GEO-CENTERS, Inc. propose to develop a fully functional software program for real-time evaluation of water toxicity. The system will fuse biosensor and other diagnostic data to produce reliable real-time detection andclassification of the environmental toxicity. The toxicity detection methodologies will be refined with special emphasis on early detection of low toxicity levels. The software will include all necessary data and user interfaces, including datavisualization and post-analysis tools, and will be reconfigurable to accommodate different types of biosensors and monitoring scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DESCRIPTION (Provided by the Applicant): The specific aims of the proposed           Phase II program are to design, fabricate, and test in the prostates of dogs an      improved instrument for hyperthermia treatments of localized prostate cancer.        The instrument will use two cooperating transrectal and transurethral microwave      balloon catheters to safely and uniformly heat diseased prostates to optimum         therapeutic temperatures. Treatment temperatures will be monitored by means of       therrnocouples and a digital microwave radiometer. The proposed hyperthermia         instrument will conform to all applicable clinical safety standards and will be      ready for clinical trials in a follow-on program. The instrument will be             self-contained. Prostate temperatures will be optimized by a microprocessor          that automatically determines the appropriate amount of microwave power to be        broadcast by each microwave balloon catheter.                                                                                                                             The addition of hyperthermia produced by microwave balloon catheters to              radiation therapy [external beam or implant therapy1 can be expected to result       in improved local control and overall survival rates in patients with localized      prostate cancer. Dual microwave balloon hyperthermia would improve the quality       of life of those patients that have constricted urethras by producing                biological stents in their urethras, and should also prove useful as a               stand-alone therapy for palliative treatments of patient with local recurrences      after radiation therapy.                                                             PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  Prostatic cancer affects many men and the overall treatment costs are extremely high.  The proposed approach has the potential for providing and adjuvant treatment that may  be performed on an \"out-patient\" basis to improve the survival rates in patients being  treated with external beam or implant therapy radiation.  The new type of catheters  developed during the proposed program and the associated hyperthermia equipment will  be important commercial products.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Currently, dry-powder inhalers (DPI) are used to deliver various drugs to the lungs for localized or systemic delivery. Although current inhaled formulations are adequate for pulmonary drug therapy under normal gravity, inhalation therapies on earth and potentially in space are plagued by low deposition characteristics into the peripheral lung spaces (10-20% pulmonary deposition) as well as variability in the absorption and residence time of the drug after inhalation. Because the particle size of pulmonary dry-powder formulations is limited to 1 to 5 microns, Nanosphere proposes to develop nanometer thin, muco-adhesive dry-powder coatings with increased pulmonary deposition and controlled-release characteristics for inhalation therapies in space. By controlling the surface characteristics of commercially available dry-powders, the proposed drug coating technique could be used to enhance the pulmonary deposition and residence time of inhaled drugs in low G as well as normal G environments, thus improving pulmonary drug therapies on earth as well as in space.",

In Phase I, OmniSite demonstratedthat rare DNA aptamers from a diverse random library were capable ofbinding to a molecular mimic of an early ice crystal structure that wasimmobilized on an affinity column.  These apatmers were recovered andamplified by PCR.  In Phase II, OmniSite proposes to prove the efficacy ofthese aptamers as anti-freeze protective agents for erythrocytes throughtesting in conjunction with the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research(WRAIR).  In addition, OmniSite will clone and sequence the anti-ice aptamers.  Whenconsensus DNA sequences are obtained, OmniSite will have these sequencessynthesized and verify that such sequences are effective at preventing icedamage to RBCs.  OmniSite will also conduct computer-aided molecular modeling(energy minimization) studies to determine the probable secondary andpossible tertiary structures of the anti-ice apatmer consensus sequences.Finally, OmniSite will investigate the buffer composition, ionic strength,delivery amount per unit volume of blood and other aspects associated wihpackaging of the anti-ice aptamers for use by the Army.",

The coatings are non-chromate and provide superior corrosion protection,abrasion resistance, with paint adhesion characteristics equal to DOW 19 chromate conversion coating.  The units eliminate the use of chromate conversion coatings and their environmental shortcomings, while significantly improving performance.  The mobileunit will consist of a small rectifier, cooling unit, electrolyte storage, collection reservoirs, as well as application heads or brushes, mounted on a mobile cart with large work surface.  The portable unit will be a small hand held battery operated unit,capable of repairing small areas on magnesium components while still on the rotorcraft.

This new method utilizes Parallax's ability to make unusual grazing incidence x-ray collection optics, Parallax's background in designing x-ray elemental analysis instrumentation, and optical aberattions which have previously been considered dis-advantageous in grazing incidence x-ray optics. With this technique, we expect to be able to use an extended x-ray source with a concentrating optic to produce a high x-ray flux region on the sample and a collection optic to collect a large solid angle of x-rays emitted from the sample. By using an aberattion of the grazing incidence optic, we will be able to limit the area seen by the detector to a tiny micro-structure. With this device, NASA will have the ability to sort samples into those containing small amounts of C,N,O,S,P, and other light elements found in life forms and reject those not likely to contain life. In addition to space applications, Parallax will have several commercial applications for the technology developed in this program",

        "abstract": "Abstract         In Phase I, Microcosm demonstrated an all-composite cryogenic propellant tank fabricated out-of-autoclave.  This revolutionary 42-inch LOX tank, tested with liquid nitrogen at 1.2 times maximum operating pressure, weighs 43% of one made of 2219 aluminum,and was produced for 15% of the cost.  The design was scaled-up from our 10-inch IR&D; tanks, one of which was the world's first all-composite LOX tank to be flown.  Phase II refines the tank design and production process to achieve flight-quality for thelarger tanks.  We first evaluate the Phase I tank, other SR-XM program tanks, and various material coupons.  A more robust design will be developed, replacing the aluminum boss and fiberglass core with carbon-composite components.  Carbon fabric coresdemonstrated at the 10-inch scale, were not used in Phase I due to thermal stresses between a scaled-up core and aluminum boss.  Use of carbon-composite in both the boss and core material will essentially eliminate these thermal stresses and enable furtherscale-up.  A Resin Transfer Molded (RTM) or Compression-Molded carbon-composite boss will be developed.  The manufacturing process will be refined to improve consistency and repeatability.  Three 42-inch tanks will be built and tested, including aflight-quality LOX tank to be delivered to AFRL.",

Hyper-ASIC penetrates to the heart of the commercial semiconductor market with a unique product strategically placed among the field programmable gate array (FPGA), digital signal processor (DSP), and traditional singleapplication, non-adaptive ASIC chipsets. The innovation of the research is the uniquely adaptive architecture featuring a Mathematical Matrix Algorithm Processor (MMAP) consisting of Dynamically Configurable (Mathematical) Macros (DCM) pipelined inhardware to support high speed parallel processing of data under software control.  Hyper-ASIC is optimized for 16 bit performance and can be expanded as requirements dictate.  Detailed analysis of the system reveals that 16 bit (and future expansion)performance is supported without truncation of data during internal computations. Hyper-ASIC has exceptional system performance metrics - frame dimensions of 1024 pixels for both X & Y dimensions, spatial pixel resolution of 16 bits, data rate of 32 Gbpssupporting 5 channels parallel processing, algorithms include",

The visualization aids will operate on a Windows NT platform, and will be installed in the Technology Integration Center (TIC) or at anotherDARPA-selected facility.  The designs of the visualization scenes will be based on those developed and prototyped in Phase I.  Enhancements and extensions to those designs will be made based on feedback received from potential users of the displays.  Tosupport the implementation of mission impact displays, AVI will coordinate its work with those cognizant researchers who are developing mission models and mission dependency databases for DARPA and DISA.  AVI will recommend data fields to be added to themission model databases for use with the visualizations as well as other data mining tasks.  AVI proposes to drive the content of the mission impact displays with data supplied by one of the mission model databases developed by DARPA or DISA.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         The primary objective of CU Aerospace's Phase II work will be to experimentally characterize the ElectriCOIL flow using advanced diagnostics and to demonstrate lasing of this electrically assisted chemical iodine laser. CU Aerospace (CUA) and theUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) believe that it is possible to construct a highly efficient electric generation scheme to provide the precursor energy donor species O2(1D) with a combination of direct current and RF discharge techniques.The CUA/UIUC team has set up a flow tube experiment that combines a pulse direct current pre-ionization coupled with a more conventional cw RF discharge. The innovative combination of these techniques will provide a steady state source of O2(1D).  Anadditional advantage to the discharge technique is the creation of significant quantities of the O2(1S) state that can assist in the process of dissociating molecular iodine.  Such an electronically produced O2(1D) generator will be even more effective ifimplemented simultaneously with an atomic iodine augmentation technique; this implementation will also be performed in Phase II.",
