        "abstract": "Abstract         THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MINIATURE ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR SUITABLE FOR PERMANENT IMPLANTATION IN THE BODY. SUCH A DEVICE IS INTENDED TO SERVE AS A CONNECT/DISCONNECT POINT FOR NEURAL PROSTHESES, ENABLING REPLACEMENT OF FAULTY COMPONENTS WITHOUT NECESSITATING REMOVAL OF AN ENTIRE IMPLANTED SYSTEM. SEVERAL DIFFERENT ELECTRICAL CONNECTORS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN CONJUNCTION WITH COCHLEAR IMPLANT DEVICES. RELIABLE ELECTRICAL OPERATION HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN VITRO FOR OVERTEN MONTHS IN ONE CONNECTOR. HOWEVER, THE CONNECTOR DESIGN IS EXCESSIVELY LARGE FOR PRACTICAL HUMAN IMPLANTATION. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A LOW PROFILE CONNECTOR 0.74\" LONG X 0.62\" WIDE X 0.120\" THICK. THE CONNECTOR FEATURES A FOUR PIN PLATINUM-IRIDIUM CONTACT DESIGN, PRESSURIZED SILASTIC(R)SEALING GASKETS, A POLYSULFONE BODY MATED VIA A TITANIUM COMPRESSION MECHANISM AND TEFLON(R)-INSULATED PLATINUM-IRIDIUM LEADWIRES. THE DESIGN IS OPTIMIZED TO MINIMIZE PIN TO PIN ELECTROLYTIC CORROSION, A FACTOR WHICH CURRENTLY LIMITS THE LIFE OF SUCH CONNECTORS. EIGHT OR TWELVE PIN DESIGN CAN BE ACHIEVED WITH MINOR SIZE INCREASES. SHORT TERM EXPERIMENTS UNDER THE MOST SEVERE CONDITIONS IN A SALINE ENVIRONMENT WILL ESTABLISH FEASIBILITY. IF PHASE I IS SUCCESSFUL, PROTOTYPE CONNECTORS WILL BE FABRICATED FOR ANIMAL STUDIES, LEADING TOWARDS CLINICAL TRIALS DURING PHASE II. ULTIMATELY THE IMPLANTABLE CONNECTOR WILL FUNCTION AS A SUBSYSTEM DISCONNECT FOR NEURAL PROSTHETIC SYSTEMS, MUSCLE STIMULATORS, ARTIFICIAL ORGANS, AND PHYSIOLOGICAL SENSORS.",

HOWEVER, THE PRECISION OF THESE CALORIMETERS, AND HENCE THEIR USE FOR PHYSICAL MEASUREMENT, WILL DEPEND ON IN-SITU CALIBRATION. RECENT WORK BY U.S. COLLABORATORS DESIGNING THE LARGE BISMUTH GERMANATE ELECTROMAGNETIC CALORIMETER FOR THE L3 EXPERIMENT ON THE LARGE ELECTRON POSITRON (LEP) COLLIDER AT CERN HAS SHOWN THAT THE PENETRATING PHOTON RADIATION PRODUCED BY THE RADIATIVE CAPTURE OF HIGH ENERGY PROTONS FROM A PULSED RADIO FREQUENCY QUADRUPOLE (RFQ) LINAC IS THE MOST VIABLE CALIBRATION SOURCE. A CALIBRATION PRECISE TO 0.5% CAN BE COMPLETED FOR THOUSANDS OF CRYSTALS AT ONCE, WITHIN ONE TO TWO HOURS. THIS PROJECT WILL DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF A NEW CALIBRATION SOURCE THAT IS APPLICABLE TO THE ENERGY RANGE AND RADIATION ENVIRONMENT OF THE SSC. FLUORIDE TARGETS WILL BE BOMBARDED TO PRODUCE HUNDREDS TO THOUSANDS OF 6 MEV RADIATIVE CAPTURE PHOTONS IN EACH CRYSTALFOR EACH BEAM PULSE, THEREBY SIMULATING A 3 TO 10 GEV ELECTRON OR PHOTON. THE OPTIMUM RFQ CONFIGURATION AND BEAM PARAMETERS WILL BE DETERMINED WITH THE AID OF L3 PHYSICISTS WHO WILL SUPPLY BAF(2) CRYSTALS, THE TARGET DESIGN WILL BE FIXED, AND THE DETECTOR READOUT FOR THE FAST 220 NM SCINTILLATOR COMPONENT WILL BE OPTIMIZED. SINCE THISCALIBRATION SYSTEM WOULD BE REQUIRED DURING THE CALORIMETER ASSEMBLY AS WELL AS DURING EXPERIMENTAL RUNS, RELIABILITY, EASE OF OPERATION, AND TRANSPORTABILITY WILL BE THE MAIN DESIGN REQUIREMENTS, ALONG WITH THE ABILITY TO MAKE A NEUTRAL HYDROGEN BEAM FOR CALIBRATION IN THE PRESENCE OF MAGNETIC FIELDS.",

THE MOST EFFECTIVE TECHNOLOGIES FOR REDUCING NO(X) INVOLVE THE INJECTION OF AMMONIA (NH(3)) INTO THE FLUE GAS TO REACT WITH NO(X), RESULTING IN THE FORMATION OF INERT MOLECULAR NITROGEN (N(2)) AND WATER. THESE PROCESSES INCLUDE THE USE OF BOTH CATALYSTS AND HIGH TEMPERATURES TO PROMOTE THE REACTION. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN HIGH NO(X) REMOVAL RATES IT IS NECESSARY TO INJECT LARGE QUANTITIES OF AMMONIA. HOWEVER, IF TOO MUCHAMMONIA IS INJECTED, SOME WILL PASS THROUGH THE SYSTEM UNREACTED. THIS AMMONIA SLIPPAGE IS HAZARDOUS BECAUSE IT CAUSES PLUGGING, CORROSION, FOULING OF THE ASH, AND INCREASED AMMONIA COSTS. TO OPTIMIZE THE NO(X) CONTROL PROCESS IT IS DESIRABLE TO CONTROL THE AMMONIA INJECTION RATE BY MEASURING THE AMMONIA SLIPPAGE AND MAINTAINING A LEVEL OF APPROXIMATELY 2 TO 5 PPM. THIS PROVIDES MAXIMUM NO(X) CONTROL WHILE MINIMIZING PROBLEMS RELATED TO THE EXCESS AMMONIA. HOWEVER, AFTER EVALUATING COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE AMMONIA DETECTORS, THE ELECTRIC POWER RESEARCH INSTITUTE CONCLUDED THAT \"NONE OF THE CURRENT MONITORS ARE JUDGED SUFFICIENTLY ACCURATE AND RELIABLE TO SERVE AS PROCESS CONTROL SYSTEMS\". THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP AND TEST A RELIABLE INSTRUMENT THAT IS CAPABLE OF CONTINUOUSLY MONITORING PARTS-PER-MILLION LEVELS OF NH(3).

RESEARCHERS WILL DEMONSTRATE THAT CHANNELING RADIATION FROM THIN SILICON CRYSTALS, UTILIZING ELECTRONS FROM A MODERATE ENERGY ACCELERATOR (30 MEV), IS A VIABLE AND LESS COSTLY ALTERNA- TIVE SOURCE OF HARD X-RAYS THAN SYNCHROTRON RADIATION.

WE PROPOSE TO CONSTRUCT AN X-RAY SYSTEM CONSISTING OF A TRANSITION RADIATOR AND COLLIMATING OPTICS WHICH WILL PERMIT THE ENTIRE RADIATION CONE TO BE FOCUSED TO A 1 - 2 MM(2) SPOT. FLEXIBLE CAPILLARY TUBES WILL PERMIT THE DIRECTION OF THE X RAYS TO BE CHANGED. PHASE I RESEARCH WILL BE USED TO TEST THE OPTICS AND THE FEASIBILITY OF THE SOURCE FOR SPECTROSCOPY. A COMPUTER-DRIVEN RAY-TRACING PROGRAM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO OPTIMIZE THE DESIGN OF THE X-RAY OPTICS. PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTS AT ADELPHI HAVE SHOWN THAT X RAYS IN THE 1 - 3 KEV SPECTRA RANGE CAN BE FOCUSED TO A 2 MM DIAMETER SPOT AT A DISTANCE OF 1.35 M FROM THE SOURCE.

THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THIS GOAL WILL INVOLVE A CONCERTED EFFORTALONG SEVERAL FRONTS. FIRST, THE DHFR-TS GENE MUST BE ISOLATED AND CLONED INTO AN E. COLI EXPRESSION VECTOR WHICH WILL ALLOW ADEQUATE OVERPRODUCTION OF THE PROTEIN. SECOND, CHROMATOGRAPHIC PROCEDURES WILL BE DEVISED FOR THE ISOLATIONOF HOMOGENEOUS PROTEIN.

HISTORICALLY, FLIRS HAVE UNDER-SAMPLED BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF DETECTORS AVAILABLE ON THE FOCAL PLANE ARRAYS IMAGERY. HOWEVER, FPA DETECTOR DENSITIES HAVE IMPROVED AND ATRS ARE SENSITIVE TO ALIASING. AS A RESULT, SAMPLING RATE IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE A CRITICAL DESIGN PARAMETER. NEW FLIR DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE FIGURES OF MERIT CANNOT BE VERIFIED SINCE ALL EXISTING SENSORS ARE LIMITED TO ONE SAMPLE RATE. IN PHASE I OF THIS EFFORT, AN INNOVATIVE DESIGN OF A VARIABLE SAMPLE RATE LABORATORY FLIR WILL BE DEVELOPED THAT, WHILE NOT PRACTICAL FOR A OPERATIONAL SYSTEM, WILL BE IDEAL FOR THE PROPOSED LABORATORY UNIT. COMBINING A STARTING FPA WITH A STEP-STARE TWO AXIS SCANNER WILL BE STUDIED. THE FLIR WILL GENERATE TV LINE RATES SO THAT THE DATA CAN BE DISPLAYED TO AN OPERATOR WITHOUT IMAGE TEARING ARTIFACTS AND DETECTOR AND APERTURE SIZES WILL BE SELECTED TO PROVIDE ANTI-ALIASING FILTERS. PHASE 2 WILL CONSIST OF THE FINAL DESIGN, FLIR FABRICATION AND THE COLLECTION OF DATA TO VERIFY THE FIGURES OF MERIT.",

THE HRG OFFERS IMPROVED ROTATION SENSING WITH SIMPLIFIED SYSTEM MECHANIZATION, HIGHER RELIABILITY AND IMPROVE LIFE CYCLE COST FOR INERTIAL NAVIGATION SYSTEMS FOR BALLISTIC MISSILES, RE-ENTRY VEHICLES, AND INTERCEPTORS. PROTOTYPE HRGS HAVE DEMONSTRATED OVERALL DRIFT RATES OF 0.003 DEG/HR. INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF A MILITARY TEMPERATURE RANGE. THE HRG IS WELL SUITED TO STRAPDOWN APPLICATIONS SINCE IT HAS VIRTUALLY UNLIMITED ANGULAR RATE CAPABILITY TOGETHER WITH EXTREMELY HIGH SCALE FACTOR STABILITY AND LOW INHERENT DYNAMIC SENSITIVITY. INTERNALLY IT DISSIPATES ONLY 12 MICROWATTS AND A CLUSTER OF THREE GYROS INCLUDING ELECTRONICS CAN BE PACKAGED IN LESS THAN 3 IN(3). LACKING ANY WEAROUT MECHANISM IMPLIES LONG OPERATING LIFE AND HIGH RELIABILITY. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PHASE I PROGRAM IS TO ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE HRG AS A RATE SENSOR FOR INERTIAL GUIDANCE SYSTEMS.

CURRENTLY, OPERATORS TRANSMIT CONTROL COMMANDS TO REMOTE MANIPULATORS WHILE VIEWING THE WORLD ON CONVENTIONAL TV MONITORS. THE MONITORS DO NOT PROVIDE A FEELING OF ON-SCENE PRESENCE BUT INSTEAD PRODUCE A PERCEPTION OF REMOTENESS BECAUSE OF THE LOSS OF DEPTH INFORMATION COMBINED WITH REDUCED RESOLUTION AND CONTRAST. THREE-DIMENSIONAL DISPLAY TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS HOLOGRAPHY AND STEREOGRAPHY, ENHANCE TELEPRESENCE WITH THE ADDITIONAL ARRAY OF VISUAL INFORMATION. OF THESE TWO TECHNOLOGIES, HOLOGRAPHY APPEARS TO BE MORE SUITABLE FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL TASK SINCE IT INTRINSICALLY PRESERVES MOTION PARALLAX. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS INNOVATIVE RESEARCH EFFORT IS TO ESTABLISH THE FEASIBILITY OF HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGING AS A TELEPRESENCE AID IN A SPACE ENVIRONMENT. THE INVESTIGATION WILL FOCUS ON STATE-OF-THE-ART HOLOGRAPHY, NASA TELEOPERATOR CONTROL TASKS, AND NASA OPERATING ENVIRONMENTS AND WILL CULMINATE IN AN ANALYSIS OF THE FEASIBILITY OF HOLOGRAPHY FOR CLOSED-LOOP, CONTINUOUS CONTROL WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON DISPLAY REQUIREMENTS FOR ENHANCED TELEOPERATIONS.",

THESE MATERIALS ARE COMPLEX AND COSTLY TO MIX AND LOAD USING EXISTING HIGH SHEAR ROCKET PROPELLANT MIXER TECHNOLOGY.

IIS HAS BUILT A PROTOTYPE PROJECTOR IN THE VISIBLE SPECTRUM SHOWING FEASIBILITY OF THE CONCEPT BY PRODUCING 1500:1 DYNAMIC RANGE, 200 FRAMES PER SECOND FRAME RATE, FLEXIBLE INPUT FORMAT, AND BAND FLEXIBILITY. THE TECHNICAL EFFORT UNDERTAKEN FOR THE SBIR IS TO INCREASE PROJECTION FRAME RATE TO 1000 HZ FROM 64 X 64 PIXEL IMAGE, AND REDUCE RISK OF THE IR DESIGN BY CHARACTERIZING COMPONENTS IN ACTUAL OPERATIONS. THIS INCLUDES AUGMENTING THE SCANNER, DATA SUPPLY ELECTRONICS, AND BEAM DELIVERY OPTICS.

THIS PROBLEM IS OF GREAT CONCERN WITH RESPECT TO CONTAMINATED GROUNDWATER. GROUNDWATER IS THESOURCE OF DRINKING WATER FOR ABOUT HALF THE NATION. THE EPAESTIMATES THAT UP TO 20% OF THE DRINKING WATER THAT COMES FROM GORUNDWATER CONTAINS VOCS. METHODS FOR REMOVING VOCS FROM GROUNDWATER THAT ARE COST-EFFECTIVE FOR MANY SIZES OF WATER TREATMENT PLANTS MUST BE DEVELOPED. THIS STUDY WILL EVALUATE THE TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY OF USING A MEMBRANE-BASED PROCESS--PERVAPORATION--TO EXTRACT THES VOCS FROM DRINKING WATER SUPPLIES. THIS TECHNOLOGY PROMISES TO BE AN INNOVATIVE ALTERNATIVE TO THE EXPENSIVE PROCESSES NOW USED THAT ARE BASED ON PACKED-TOWER AIR STRIPPING AND GRAN- ULAR ACTIVATED-CARBON ABSORPTION. IN MEMBRANE PERVAPORATION, THE DISSOLVED VOC-REMOVAL EFFI- CIENCY OF THE MEMBRANE PERVAPORATION PROCESS.

THEY WILL PERFORM THESE ANALY-SES FOR RELATIVELY SMALL-SCALE WATER TREATMENT SYSTEMS, AS THE SMALLER-SCALE SYSTEMS ARE THE ONES MOST LIKELY TO BE CONTAMINATED BY VOCS. IF THE PROCESS APPEARS TECHNICALLY ANDCONTINUATION WITH A POLOT-SCALE DEMONSTRATION UNIT AND THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF PHASE III COMMERCIALIZATION. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS PHASE I PROGRAM WOULD DEMON- STRATE THE TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY OF MEMBRANE PERVAPORATION PROCESSES FOR REMOVING VOCS FORM DRINKING SUP-PLIES. IT WOULD ALSO CLEARLY DEMONSTRATE THE MEMBRANE-BASEDSYSTEM'S MAJOR ADVANTAGES OVER THE TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC PACKED-TOWER AIR-STRIPPING AND GRANULAR ACTIVATED-COMMERCIALADSORPTION SYSTEMS. THIS MEMBRANE PROCESS HAS MANY POTEN- TIAL COMMERCIAL WATER TREATMENT APPLICATIONS. SPECIFIC COM-MERCIAL WATER TREATMENT APPLICATIONS RELATED TO THE PHASE I RESEARCH INCLUDE REMOVAL OF VOCS FROM CONTAMINATED DRINKING WATER SUPPLIE, AQUIFER, INDUSTRIAL WASTE STREAMS, RECLAIMED WATER, MUNICIPAL WASTEWATER, AND THE SITES OF HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL SPILLS.",

DUE TO THE WIDESPREAD AND LARGE-SCALEUSE OF METALS, MONITORING THEIR PRESENCE IN WASTE STREAMS AND CONTROLLING THEIR LEVELS OF DISCHARGE INTO THE ENVIRON-MENT ARE DIFFICULT AND COSTLY TASKS--TASKS THAT ARE ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT GIVEN THE TOXICITY OF MANY COMMONLY USED METALS. CURRENTLY AVAILABLE SENSOR TECHNOLOGY FOR ON-SITE METAL -ION DETECTION IS LIMITED TO ION-SELECTIVE ELECTRODES (ISE) --FRAGILE, SLOW, HIGH-MAINTENANCE DEVICES THAT ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO INTERFERENCE AND FOULING. THE ALTERNATIVE IS EXPENSIVE AND TIME-CONSUMING OFF-SITE LABORATORY ANALYSIS. THE TECHNIQUES AT HAND ARE CLEARLY NOT ADEQUATE FOR ADDRESS-ING THE PROBLEM. AS A NEW MEANS OF MEETING THIS CHALLENGE, THIS RESEARCH WILLATTEMPT TO DEVELOP THIN-FILM SENSORS THAT CAN BE CHEMICALLY \"TUNED\" SELECTIVELY FOR EACH OF THE FOLLOWING TOXIC-METAL IONS: CR3+, CR6=, CD2+ AND BA2+. SINCE THERE ARE NO COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE SENSORS FOR CR3+, CR6+, AND BA2+, AND SINCETHE CURRENT TECHNOLOGY FOR REMOTE DETETION OF CD2+ IS INADE-QUATE, THE SENSORS TO DEVELOPED IN THIS PROGRAM SHOULD FIND WIDE APPLICATION IN POLLUTION MONITORING AND CONTROL.

THIS BACKGROUND ACTIVITY CONSTITUTES A FORM OF INTERFERENCE, OR \"BRAIN NOISE\", THAT MASKS THE DESIRED WEAKER MEG SIGNALS EVOKED BY THE STIMULUS. PRESENT TECHNIQUES FOR ENHANCING THE EVOKED RESPONSE OF THE MEG SUCH AS SIGNAL AVERAGING, ARE NOT APPLICABLE TO SINGLE TRAIL MEG MEASUREMENTS. SUCH MEASUREMENTS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HUMAN PERFORMANCE AND COGNITIVE PROCESSING BECAUSE THE BRAIN'S RESPONSE MAY BE MODULATED BY FACTORS SUCH AS ATTENTION AND WORK LOAD WHICH CAN CHANGE DYNAMICALLY. WE PROPOSE DEVELOPING A NEW TECHNIQUE, TERMED LEAD FIELD SYNTHESIS (LFS), WHICH INCORPORATES ALL THE MEG SIGNALS MEASURED FROM AN ARRAY OF SENSORS INTO A SINGLE MEASUREMENT. THIS \"VIRTUAL SENSOR\" ESTIMATES HOW MUCH OF THE OBSERVED MEG SIGNAL IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A PARTICULAR LOCATION WITHIN THE BRAIN. LFS COMBINES ASPECTS OF SPATIAL SIGNAL AVERAGING, NOISE REDUCTION, AND INVERSE SOLUTION. WE WILL DEVELOP THE LFS TECHNIQUE FOR IMPROVING SNR IN MEG MEASUREMENTS. THIS PROJECT REPRESENTS A VITAL STEP TOWARD THE GOAL OF LOW-NOISE IMAGING OF BRAIN ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY.",

THIS PROJECT WILL ESTABLISH THE FEASIBILITY OF A MINIATURE, CLOSED-CYCLE CRYOCOOLER TO ELIMINATE THIS EXPENSIVE AND WASTEFUL PRACTICE, THEREBY DRAMATICALLY REDUCING THE COST OF CRYOGENIC REFRIGERATION. BY INCORPORATING THE INTEGRATION OF HEAT EXCHANGERS AND EXPANSION ENGINES IN A CONCENTRIC TUBE CONFIGURATION, THIS CRYOCOOLER WILL EXPLOIT THE ADVANTAGES OF BOTH COUNTERFLOW AND REGENERATIVE HEAT EXCHANGE, RESULTING IN EXCELLENT HEAT EXCHANGE EFFICIENCY OVER THE ENTIRE TEMPERATURE SPAN FROM 300 K DOWN TO 4.5 K. THE NOMINAL POWER CONSUMPTION BY THE WARM COMPRESSOR IS LESS THAN 500 W PER 1 W OF COOLING AT 4.5 K. IN ADDITION, THE NEW CONFIGURATION IS LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO GAS CONTAMINATION THAN A REGENERATIVE CYCLE (GIFFORD-MCMAHON OR STIRLING) USED IN COMBINATION WITH A JOULE-THOMSON STAGE, WHICH IS EASILY BLOCKED WITH CONDENSED CONTAMINANTS. THE FIRST OBJECTIVE OF THE PHASE I PROJECT IS TO FINALIZE THE INTEGRAL HEAT EXCHANGER AND EXPANSION ENGINE CONFIGURATION. THEN, MAJOR COMPONENTS SUCHAS VALVES AND THE DRIVE MECHANISM WILL BE DESIGNED. USING THESE PHYSICAL DESIGNS, A PERFORMANCE ALGORITHM WILL BE DEVELOPED THAT WILL BE USED TO BUILD A DATA BASE.

THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF SEPARATING DNA FRAGMENTS (>500 KB), WHICH IS EXPECTED TO SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVE THE PROCESS OF SEQUENCING THE HUMAN GENOME. A MOVING CHARGE IN A MAGNETIC FIELD EXPERIENCES A LORENTZ FORCE PERPENDICULAR TO BOTH THE DIRECTION OF THE MOVEMENT AND THE MAGNETIC FIELD. BY APPLYING OSCILLATING CROSSED ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC FIELDS (OCEMF), BIOLOGICAL PARTICLES WILL DRIFT AT A VELOCITY DEPENDENT ON SIZE AND DIELECTRIC PROPERTIES, AND CAN SUBSEQUENTLY BE SORTED INTO FRACTIONS. THIS EFFECT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED ON A VARIETY OF CELLS. A SENSITIVE DEPENDENCY OF THE DRIFT VELOCITY ON THE CELL'S PROPERTIES HAS BEEN OBSERVED. DNA EXHIBITS A LARGE INDUCED DIPOLE MOMENT AT LOW FREQUENCIES WITH A RELAXATION TIME DEPENDENT ON THE LENGTH OF THE FRAGMENT. DNA FRAGMENTS WILL BE INDUCED TO DRIFT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF OCEMF. BECAUSE THE DRIFT VELOCITY DIRECTION IS ACROSS THE ELECTRIC FIELD, AND THE VELOCITY DEPENDS ON THE LENGTH OF THE FRAGMENT, BETTER SEPARATION CAN BE EXPECTED THAN WITH PULSED FIELD ELECTROPHORESIS.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A FREQUENT APPROACH TO THE DESIGN OF COAL-WATER SLURRY (CWS)RESIDENTIAL/INDUSTRIAL COMBUSTORS IS TO ADAPT THE CONVENTIONAL OIL BURNER DESIGNS TO THE NEW SERVICE. TWO SEVERE DIFFICULTIES ARE ENCOUNTERED; ONE IS COMBUSTION STABILITY AND COMPLETENESS IN THESE LOW FLOW RATE/LOW VOLUMEDEVICES, AND THE OTHER IS CWS INJECTION. THUS WHAT IS NEEDED IS A SOURCE OF VERY HIGH TEMPERATURE AIR THAT WOULD FLASH-VAPORIZE THE WATER IN A CWS DROPLET, AND RAPIDLY PYROLIZE AND IGNITE THE COAL, THEREBY STABILIZING THE FLAME EVEN UNDER POOR MIXING CONDITIONS. GAS OR OIL PILOT FLAMES CANNOT ACHIEVE HIGH ENOUGH TEMPERATURE BECAUSE THEY MUST ACT AS VITIATORS. IN ADDITION, THEIR USE WOULD REQUIRE DUALFUEL STORAGE AT EACH LOCATION. A PLASMATRON CAN HEAT AN AIR STREAM TO ALMOST ANY TEMPERATURE AND DISCHARGE IT INTO THE COMBUSTION ZONE. THIS HOT AIR STREAM, WHICH CONTAINS HIGHLY REACTIVE ATOMIC OXYGEN, PROVIDES THE COMBUSTION STABILITY AND MAKES THE COMBUSTION OF CWS IN A SMALL VOLUME POSSIBLE. BASED ON THIS APPROACH, A NEW DEVICE CALLED A PLASMATRON CWS COMBUSTOR IS PLANNED. PRELIMINARY CALCULATIONS INDICATE THAT THE THERMAL GAIN (G) OF A 100,000 BTU/HR COMBUSTOR (G = THERMAL OUTPUT/ELECTRIC INPUT)IS 30 OR HIGHER. THIS MEANS THAT THE RESIDENTIAL PLASMATRONCWS COMBUSTOR (PCWSC) WOULD REQUIRE ABOUT 1 KW OF ELECTRIC POWER WHILE DELIVERING 30 KW OF THERMAL POWER. THE PHASE I FEASIBILITY STUDY IS DIVIDED INTO THREE PARTS: (1) STEADY STATE MODELING OF THE PCWSC TO DETERMINE ITS OPTIMUM OVERALLCONFIGURATION: (2) TIME DEPENDENT MODELING OF THE EVOLUTION OF THE CWS DROPLET AFTER ITS INJECTION INTO THE HIGH TEMPERATURE OXIDIZER TO DETERMINE THE REQUIRED COMBUSTOR RESIDENCE TIME; AND (3) CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF THE PCWSC. BUILDING AND TESTING OF A PROTOTYPICAL PLASMATRON CWS COMBUSTOR IS PLANNED FOR PHASE II.",

NEVERTHELESS, UNTIL RECENTLY, THE HEMOPOIETIC CULTURE ASSAYS HAVE BEEN TIME CONSUMING, EXPENSIVE AND LABOR INTENSIVE, AND THE HORMONE ACTIVITIES POORLY STANDARDIZED. OUR PROPOSAL SEEKS TO EXPLOIT RECENT ADVANCES IN CULTURE TECHNOLOGY AND RECOMBINANT HORMONE PRODUCTION TO DEVELOP A RAPID, PRE-STANDARDIZED ASSAY KIT THAT WILL PERMIT CLINICAL HEMATOLOGY LABORATORY PERSONNEL TO ROUTINELY PERFORM OVERNIGHT CULTURES THAT ASSESS THE HORMONE-DEPENDENCE OF HEMOPOIETIC CELLS IN PATIENTS WITH BLOOD DISORDERS. IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT MANY BREAST AND PROSTATE CANCERS ARE HORMONE-DEPENDENT AND RESPOND TO ANTI-HORMONE THERAPY. ON THE BASIS OF SEVERAL ANIMAL AND A FEW HUMAN STUDIES, IT IS SUSPECTED THAT CANCERS OF THE BLOOD, PANCREAS, THYROID, BRAIN AND OTHER TISSUE MAY ALSO REMAIN HORMONE-DEPENDENT. THE PROPOSED KITS WILL PERMIT WIDE SPREAD TESTING OF HORMONE SENSITIVITY IN HEMATOLOGY ONCOLOGY PATIENTS. THE ACCUMULATION OF SUCH INFORMATION MAY THEN LEAD TO NEW HORMONE-BASED APPROACHES TO THE TREATMENT OF LEUKEMIA AND OTHER CANCERS. FURTHERMORE, ACCORDING TO PUBLISHED ANIMAL STUDIES, THE ASSAYS SHOULD BE USEFUL FOR THE EARLY DETECTION, DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPEUTIC MONITORING OF LEUKEMIAS.",

FURTHERMORE, EVEN IN THE PRESENCE OF CRYOPROTECTANTS, THE FORMATION OF ICE DURING COOLING AND ICE RECRYSTALLIZATION DURING WARMING ARE MAJOR DAMAGING EVENTS DURING FREEZE-THAWING OF RED BLOOD CELLS. TO CIRCUMVENT THESE OBSTACLES TO RED CELL PRESERVATION, WE WILL USE A NOVEL PROTEIN (ICE CRYSTAL CONTROL PROTEIN, ICCP) THAT DEPRESSES THE FREEZING TEMPERATURE OF WATER, MODIFIES ICE CRYSTAL SHAPE AND INHIBITS RECRYSTALLIZATION.

THESE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT MULTISPECTRAL DATA, ESPECIALLY IN THE THERMAL INFRARED REGION, PROVIDES VALUABLE INFORMATION ON FIRE CHARACTERISTICS. EXISTING INSTRUMENTS PROVIDE THERMAL INFRARED DATA IN ONLY A FEW BROAD BANDS OF THE SPECTRUM AND IT IS PREDICTED THAT BETTER MEASUREMENTS COULD BE OBTAINED USING MANY MORE BANDS AND HIGHER SPECTRAL RESOLUTION. IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO DESIGN A NEW SPECTROMETER FOR AN EXISTING NASA AIRBORNE MULTISPECTRALSCANNER TO ACQUIRE THE DESIRED HIGH SPECTRAL RESOLUTION DATA. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY OF DESIGNING AND BUILDING A MULTISPECTRAL THERMAL INFRARED SPECTROMETER. THE EFFORT WILL INVOLVE THE ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVE SPECTROMETER DESIGNS WHICH MIGHT BE IMPLEMENTED USING THE EXISTING SCANNER PRIMARY OPTICS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING ELECTRONICS. EACH ALTERNATIVE DESIGN WILL BE EVALUATED WITH RESPECT TO COMPATIBILITY WITH THE EXISTING SYSTEM, NUMBER OF SPECTRAL BANDS THAT CAN BE OBTAINED, AND THE PROBABLE PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RESULTING INSTRUMENT.

TO EXPAND THE USE OF LOW COST ACCESS TO SPACE FOR A VARIETY OF SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENTS, THERE IS NOW A NEED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A LOW COST BUS THAT CAN PROVIDE WEIGHT, VOLUME, ELECTRIC POWER, OPTIONAL STABILIZATION AND EXTENDED LIFE (THROUGH A PROPULSION SYSTEM TO RAISE ORBIT ALTITUDE) TO SCIENTIFIC PAYLOADS. DSI HAS DEVELOPED THE CONCEPT AND MUCH OF THE HARDWARE FOR A MODULAR LINE OF SUCH BUSES, BASED ON FLIGHT PROVEN COMPONENTS THAT CAN PROVIDE MORE THAN 50 LBS. PAYLOAD IN A STANDARD GAS CANISTER OR ELV, PROVIDE TELEMETRY AND COMMAND LINKS, 10 MEGABITS OF ON-BOARD MEMORY, SCHEDULABLE EXPERIMENT AND HOUSEKEEPING FUNCTIONS AND A PORTABLE GROUND STATION THAT CAN OPERATE ALL FUNCTIONS OF THE SATELLITE, AND IS BASED ON AN IBM PCXT. THE OPTIONAL PROPULSION SYSTEM IS A SEPARATE, DETACHABLE MODULE THAT MAY BE DISCARDED WHEN IN ORBIT TO REDUCE DRAG. THE BUS IS THEN GRAVITY GRADIENT STABILIZED. THE MODULAR BUS CAN BE ADAPTED TO BOTH THE STANDARD AND TO THE EXTENDED GAS CANISTERS. IN PHASE I, DSI WILL COMPLETE THE SYSTEM DESIGN AND WILL BUILD THE SPACECRAFT BUS.

FUTURE PHASE II RESEARCH MAY DEVELOP A COMPACT SYSTEM SUITABLE FOR READING ALL STANDARD RADIOGRAPHS. CORRECT INTERPRETATION OF X-RAY FILMS IS CRUCIAL IN MEDICAL DIAGNOSTICS. DIGIVISION PROPOSES TO ENHANCE X-RAY FILM IMAGES IN REAL TIME WITHOUT DEGRADING EITHER THE SPATIAL RESOLUTION OR THE DYNAMIC RANGE OF CONTRAST BY REPLACING THE TRADITIONAL LIGHTBOX WITH A COMPUTER-CONTROLLED ILLUMINATOR. SPATIALLY MODULATED ILLUMINATION IS GENERATED ON THE FILM SUCH THAT AN OBSERVER CAN PERFORM SELF-ALIGNED UNSHARP SUBTRACTION OR OTHER TYPES OF IMAGE ENHANCEMENT. OBSERVERS CAN ADJUST THE AMOUNT OF PROCESSING WITH IMMEDIATE RESPONSE. NONLINEAR COMPENSATION FOR IMPROPER EXPOSURE OF FILM IS AUTOMATIC. AS THE OBSERVERALWAYS VIEWS THE FILM DIRECTLY, NO DEGRADATION OF SPATIAL RESOULTION OCCURS. THIS MAKES SOPHISTICATED LOCALLY ADAPTIVE REAL TIME IMAGE PROCESSING ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE FOR ALL RADIOLOGY SUITES.",

CURRENT MUNITION CONTAINER DESIGNS MUST MEET REQUIREMENTS FOR VIBRATION, ENVIRONMENT, HANDLING, MAINTAINABILITY, SIZE, AND WEIGHT, BUT DO NOT ADDRESS INSENSITIVEMUNITION PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS OF PROTECTION AGAINST FRAGEMENT/BULLET IMPACT AND SYMPATHETIC DETONATION. OUR GOAL IS TO REDUCE THE PROBABILITY OF A DETONATION/EXPLOSION OF THE MUNITION WHILE STORED IN THE CONTAINER. A COST-EFFECTIVE AND TIMELY SOLUATION TO THIS TECHNICAL CHALLENGE CAN BE OBTAINED BY INTEGRATING MODERN ARMOR MATERIAL TECHNOLOGY AND SYMPATHETIC DETONATION PROTECTION SYSTEMS INTO THE DESIGN OF THE MUNITION CONTAINERS. BASED ON RECENT TESTING DYNA EAST PERFORMED FOR FMC AND MARTIN MARIETTA, AND PRELIMINARY REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE, SEVERAL INNOVATIVE DESIGNS APPEAR PROMISING. BOTH FMC AND MARTIN MARIETTA, PRIME MANUFACTURERS OF THE VLS AND OTHER WEAPON CONTAINER SYSTEMS, HAVE AGREED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROPOSAL PROGRAM. THEIR EXPERTISE WILL BE SOUGHT RESPECT TO MANUFACTURABILITY, SYSTEM COST AND GENERAL FEASIBILITY OF APPROACH. IN THIS PROGRAM WE WILL INTEGRATE ADVANCED CALCULATIONAL METHODS AND TEST TECHNIQUES TO PROVIDE THE NAVY WITH NOT ONLY IMPROVED CONTAINER CONFIGURATIONS DESIGNS BUT AN IMPROVED DESIGN METHODOLOGY.",

THE PROPOSED CONCEPT UTILIZES HEAT PIPES AS INTERMEDIATE HEAT TRANSFER ELEMENTS BETWEEN THE BURNER AND THE BOILER SECTIONS. THE INCORPORATION OF HEAT PIPES CONVERTS THE STEAM GENERATOR FROM A \"WATER TUBE\" TO A \"FIRE TUBE\" BOILER. STEAM LOCOMOTIVES HAVE USED THIS DESIGN FOR OVER A CENTURY WITHOUT REQUIRING A TREATED WATER SUPPLY. THE HEAT PIPES WOULD BE FABRICATED FROM STAINLESS STEEL AND USE WATER AS THE WORKING FLUID. THE EVAPORATOR SECTIONS OF THE HEAT PIPE ARE LOCATED WITHIN THE BURNER COMPARTMENT; THE CONDENSERS ARE IMMERSED IN THE BOILER SECTION OF THE STEAM GENERATOR. BOILING AND STEAM GENERATION OCCURS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE HEAT PIPES WHICH REDUCES THE TENDENCY OF BUILD-UP OF DEPOSITS. SINCE THE PIPES HAVE SMOOTH WALLS ANY DEPOSITS CAN BE REMOVED BY PERIODIC MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS. DURING THE PROPOSED PROJECT SEVERAL CONFIGURATIONS OF HEAT PIPE STEAM GENERATORS WILL BE STUDIES. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS AND DESIGN STUDIES WILL BE CONDUCTED AND CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT ITEMS IDENTIFIED. TYPICAL HEAT PIPES WILL BE TESTED UNDER CONDITIONS WHICH SIMULATE THOSE OF A STEAM GENERATOR.

TO ADDRESS THIS NEED, THE FEASIBILITY IS BEING DEMONSTRATED OF HIGH-FLUX TES BASED ON GRAPHITE/PHASE-CHANGE MATERIAL COMPOSITES.

THE APPROACH, BASED ON THE NEWLY DEVELOPED METAL/PCM COMPOSITE TECHNOLOGY, INDICATES THAT HIGHEST PERFORMANCE IS ACHIEVED WITH HIGHLY DISPERSED 50-50 COMPOSITES.

THE WIRELESS LINK CAN BE USED TO REPLACE HARD-WIRE CABLES OR DATA BUS (TO SAVE WEIGHT AND WEAPONS RELIABILITY) AND/OR AS A REDUNDANT BACKUP TO WEAPON AIRCRAFT SURVIVABILITY IN EVENT OF BATTLE DAMAGE. FURTHERMORE, THE WIRELESS LINK CAN EXTEND THE TOTAL AIRCRAFT COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM TO MAINTAIN LIMITED RANGE DATA FLOW BETWEEN AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE AFTER LAUNCH OR BETWEEN A BUS MISSILE AND THE SUBMUNITIONS WHICH IT RELEASES. THE EMPHASIS IN THIS PROPOSAL IS ON THE USE OF THE WIRELESS LINK FOR EXTERNAL LINKS BETWEEN AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE AFTER LAUNCH OR BETWEEN BUS MISSILE AND SUBMUNITIONS AFTER THE SUBMUNITIONS ARE LAUNCHED BUT FLYING IN PROXIMITY TO THE BUS MISSILE. A MIL-STD 1553B CAPABILITY FOR SUCH A BUS IS FEASIBLE. THE USE OF THE V-BAND (55-65GHZ) REDUCES PROBABILITY OF ENEMY DETECTION AND JAMMING OF THE COMMUNICATIONS LINKS. THE COMMAND/RESPONSE SYSTEM WOULD BE FORMATTED TO BE COMPLETELY COMPATIBLE WITH EXISTING 1553B DATA BUS SYSTEMS SO THAT THE EXTENDED REMOTE LINKS WOULD BE FULLY COMPATIBLE WITH THE AIRCRAFT DATA COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM.",

LWIR INFRARED FOCAL PLANE ARRAYS HAVE BEEN MADE AND HGCDTE EPILAYERS CAN BE PRODUCED BY NOT ONLY LPE BUT ALSO VARIOUS VAPOR PHASE METHODS. HOWEVER, AMONG ALL OF THESE SUCCESSES, THERE IS A BIG PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED, I.E. THE LOW DETECTOR ARRAY YIELD. BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS, THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF POOR PV DEVICES, AND CRYSTALLINE DEFECTS ARE MOST LIKELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE POOR DEVICE PERFORMANCE. THE GOAL OF THIS PROGRAM IS THEREFORE TO DISCOVER THESE DEFECTS AND TO DEVELOP METHODS TO AVOID OR TO ELIMINATE THEM. IN THE PHASE I PROGRAM, WE WILL STUDY THE CAUSE OF TE PRECIPITATES AND THEIR EFFECTS TO THE MATERIALS AND DETECTORS BOTH THEORETICALLY AND EXPERIMENTALLY. IN ADDITION, CRYSTALLINE DEFECTS IN ZNCDTE SUBSTRATES WILL BE IDENTIFIED AND THEIR EFFECTS ON THE LPE LAYERS WILL BE CHARACTERIZED.",

AS THE DRILLING DIRECTION APPROACHES THE HORIZONTAL, THE RATE OF PENETRATION DIMINISHES AND THE HORIZONTAL REACH DECREASES, SINCE IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO APPLY SIGNIFICANT WEIGHT ON THE BIT. A SYSTEM THAT COMBINES ULTRAHIGH PRESSURE JETS (30,000 PSI) WITH MECHANICAL BITS HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO BE CAPABLE OF DRILLING EFFECTIVELY AT VERY LOW WEIGHT-ON-BIT LEVELS. THISSYSTEM USES THE ULTRAHIGH PRESSURE (UHP) FLUID JETS TO SLOT THE ROCK BEFORE THE MECHANICAL CUTTERS ACT ON IT. AS A RESULT, THE DRILLED ROCK FAILS IN THE SHEAR MODE INSTEAD OF THE COMPRESSIVE MODE. THIS SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCES THE LOAD REQUIRED ON THE MECHANICAL CUTTERS TO DRILL THE ROCK EFFECTIVELY. IN THIS PROJECT, THE UHP TECHNOLOGY WILL BE EXTENDED TO DIRECTIONAL DRILLING. IN PHASE I, A DOWNHOLE MOTOR ASSEMBLY WILL BE DESIGNED WITH TWO PARALLEL STREAMS OF MUD, ONE AT 3,000 PSI AND ONE AT 30,000 PSI. IN ADDITION, A HIGH PRESSURE SWIVEL THAT CAN OPERATE IN A DEEP HOLE ENVIRONMENT WILL BE DESIGNED AND TESTED.

THE DLDV/SP, BASED ON A FIELD-PROVEN DLDV FOR OCEAN DEPLOYMENT UNDER ICE FLOWS, WILL BE DESIGNED FOR ON-AXIS BACKSCATTER OPERATION. IN A PULSED MODE, THE DIODE LASER WILL GENERATE INSTANTANEOUS LASER POWER IN THE TENS OF WATTS, WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR THE SCANNING, BACKSCATTER OPERATION. TWO CRITICAL ISSUES THAT MUST BE RESOLVED ARE THE EXTREMELY SHORT PULSE WIDTH (200 TO 500 NS) AND THE RELATIVELY LARGE SPECTRAL WIDTH (ABOUT 3.5 NM). TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES, WE PROPOSE, RESPECTIVELY, THE INCORPORATION OF AN OPTICAL MODULATION SCHEME TO CREATE A \"RUNNING\" FRINGE PATTERN AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OPTICAL FILTERING OR AN ETALON. THE DLDV/SP WILL MEASURE PROFILES OF MEAN AND FLUCTUATING FLOW COMPONENTS AS WELL AS SHEAR FLOW. BECAUSE LASER ANEMOMETRY IS ALSO CAPABLE OF MEASURING PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTION AND NUMBER DENSITY, SIMULTANEOUS MEASUREMENTS OF PARTICLE SPEED AND SIZE DISTRIBUTION AND NUMBER DENSITY MAY BE MADE WITH THE DLDV/SP. A ZOOM OPTICAL SYSTEM WILL BE DESIGNED FOR SCANNING THE FOCAL VOLUME, WITH RANGES ON THE ORDER OF 10 M IN AIR AND 1 M IN WATER. DURING PHASE I, A TEST MODEL WILL BE DESIGNED, ASSEMBLED, AND TESTED TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT.",

ALL OF THESE METHODS SUFFER FROM FLAWS THAT MAKE THE RESULTANT TRACKING SYSTEMS VULNERABLE TO SIMPLE COUNTERMEASURES. THE SIMPLEST, AND MOST EFFECTIVE COUNTERMEASURE IS FOUNDED IN THE CREATION OF ARTIFACT IN THE SCENE. THE PROPOSED PROTOTYPE TRACKING SYSTEM OVERCOMES THE ARTIFACT PROBLEM QUITE WELL. THE HARDWARE BASED ISCAN TARGET TRACKER PROVIDES AUTOMATIC ARTIFACT ELIMINATION BY TRACKING THE GEOMETRIC CENTER OF THE LARGEST SINGLE TARGET WHILE IGNORING ALL OTHER APPARENT TARGETS IN THE FIELD OF VIEW IMAGED ON THE SENSOR ARRAY. THE FACT THAT THE BASIC TRACKING ALGORITHM HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN SILICON, MEANS THAT IT IS ALSO FAST. IT CAN PROCESS A FULL 1024 X 512 ARRAY IN 5 MSEC (200 FPS) OUTPUTTING TARGET POSITION AND SIZE DATA WITH 9 BIT RESOLUTION.

A SECONDARY PURPOSE IS TO ENHANCE THE VOLUME OF MONOCIONAL ANTIBODY PRODUCTION OVER THAT NOW ACHIEVABLE BY BATCH PROCEDURES AND MINIMIZE SERUM USAGE. A LABORATORY-SCALE, NONSTERILE, PLEXIGLASS FREEFALL AND PACKED BED-WASH COLUMN WILL BE SET UP FOR MEASUREMENT OF THE PHYSICAL-CHEMICAL PARAMETERS. THE ALGINATE DROPS FROM A DROP FORMER ON TOP OF THE FREE-FALL COLUMN WILL BE GELLED INTO CAPSULES UPON FALLING INTO A CALCIUM CHLORIDE SOLUTION. THE CAPSULES WILL BE CONTINUOUSLY TRANSFERRED TO A MOVING BED-WASH COLUMN WHERE THE CALCIUM SOLUTION WILL BE REPLACED BY A SALINE SOLUTION. THE PARAMETER RANGE FOR CONTINUOUS AND STABLE OPERATION WILL BE MEASURED. SIMULTANEOUSLY, A THEORETICAL MODELING ANALYSIS WILL BE UNDERTAKEN.

SUCH A TECHNOLOGY WOULD AFFECT INCREASING NUMBERS OF NASA EMPLOYEES AT ALL LEVELS AS COMPUTER TERMINALS BECOME WIDELY USED IN MANAGEMENT, ENGINEERING, AND ACCOUNTING FOR DECISION-MAKING,PROJECT AND PROGRAM CONTROL, AND INTRA-AGENCY COMMUNICATIONS. DATA FLOW IN NETWORKS PRODUCED BY MANUAL DATA ENTRY AT CONTROLLED LEVELS OF ACCURACY WOULD IMPACT THE MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE OF PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS AND WOULD HAVE A FAVORABLE IMPACT ON PRODUCTIVITY. THIS RESEARCH PROJECT IS DIRECTED TOWARD DEVELOPING A TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN BE USED FOR A MORE ACCURATE MANUAL DATA INPUT SYSTEM COR COMPUTER DATA BASES. AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE GROWING DATA BASE ERROR PROBLEM INDICATES THAT THE MAN/MACHINE INTERFACE, HENCE ACCURACY, CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED BY AN INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH. THE PHASE I EFFORT WILL DEVELOP AN EXPERIMENTAL TEST PROGRAM WHICH WILL EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS OF PERSONNEL INVOLVED WITH DATA ENTRY. GAMMA RESEARCH, INC.

TO ACHIEVE THIS, DNA SEQUENCES WERE DESIGNED AND SYNTHESIZED THAT COULDBE USED AS LINKERS TO CONNECT THE DNA SEQUENCES OF THE ANTI-BGH VARIABLE LIGHT CHAIN FRAGMENT (VL) AND THE VARIABLEHEAVY CHAIN FRAGMENT (VH). THESE LINKERS ALLOW THE TWO VARIABLE DOMAINS TO FOLD AND ASSOCIATE INTO A MOLECULE THAT MIMICS THE ACTIVITY OF THE FV FRAGMENT AND IS CALLED A SINGLE-CHAIN ANTIGEN-BINDING PROTEIN (SCABP). THE MODIFIED DNA SEQUENCE HAS BEEN INCORPORATED INTO A PLASMID FOR EXPRESSION IN E.

THE FAILURE OF PULSED CAPACITORS AND TRANSFORMERS UNDER ROUTING OPERATING CONDITIONS PRESENTS A SERIOUS PROBLEM TO PULSED POWER SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT. COMPONENT FAILURE IMPACTS BOTH THE COST AND SAFETY OF THE PROGRAMS IN WHICH THEY ARE UTILIZED. MECHANICAL STRAINS IN THE CASES OF THESE DEVICES ARE THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF COMPONENT FAILURE. STANDARD STRAIN MEASURING DEVICES ARE INCAPABLE OF OPERATING IN THE HIGH ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERFERENCE (EMI) ENVIRONMENT ASSOCIATED WITH PULSE CAPACITORS AND TRANSFORMERS. THE PROPOSED SENSORS ARE IMMUNE TO THE EFFECTS OF EMI. THEY ARE, THEREFORE, IDEALLY SUITED TO THIS MEASUREMENT ENVIRONMENT. ADVANTAGES OF THE PROPOSED SENSING APPROACH INCLUDE A TEMPERATURE INSENSITIVE SENSOR OUTPUT, OPTICAL ISOLATION, PERFORMANCE CAPABILITIES EQUIVALENT TO THOSE OF FOIL GAUGES, AND A SENSOR OUTPUT DETECTION SCHEME WHICH IS IMMUNE TO SOURCE LIGHT INTENSITY VARIATIONS, MICROBENDING LOSSES AND THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION FIBER DARKENING.",

DEPLETION OF NATURAL FOOD PARTICLES IN THE BENTHIC BOUNDARY LAYER ABOVE MUSSEL BEDS HAS BEEN RECENTLY IDENTIFIED AS THE MAJOR FACTOR LIMITING PRODUCTION AT LOW CURRENT SPEEDS. AT HIGHER CURRENTS, VERTICAL EDDY DIFFUSION PROVIDES FOR THE TURBULENT TRANSFER OF FOOD TO THE MUSSELS AT RATES FASTER THAN CONSUMPTION, AND THERE IS NO DEPLETION IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER. QUANTIFICATION OF EFFECTS OF MUSSEL DENSITY AND CURRENT ON DEPLETION IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER AND GROWTH (PRODUCTION) OF EXPERIMENTALLY SEEDED MUSSELS WILL RESULT IN A MATHEMATICAL MODEL PREDICTING THE CORRECT SEEDING DENSITY AND POTENTIAL YIELD FOR A GIVEN GROW-OUT AREA. HIGH TIDAL CURRENTS IN THE GULF OF MAINE - BAY OF FUNDY REGION MAY RESULT IN UNIQUE OPPORTUNITIES FOR HIGH DENSITY CULTIVATION AND HIGH PRODUCTION YIELDS. LOW CURRENT AREAS MAY BE MORE EFFECTIVELY FARMED BY ADJUSTING MUSSEL PATCH LENGTH AND DENSITY TO THE CARRYING CAPACITY OF THE LEASE SITE.",

THE METHOD CAN DISTINGUISH BETWEEN PHYSICALLY ADSORBED, CHEMICAL ADSORBED, NEAR SURFACE, AND BULK WATER. SINCE AS LITTLE AS 0.01 MICROGRAMS OF WATER CAN BE DETECTED FROMA 10 GRAM SAMPLE, THE METHOD IS SUFFICIENTLY SENSITIVE TO MEASURE SUBMONOLAYER QUANTITIES OF WATER. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PHASE I STUDY IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE USEFULNESS OF THE THERMODESORPTION METHOD THROUGH MEASURMENT OF THE WATER ASSOCIATED WITH THE BARE AND COATED OPTICAL FILAMENTS.

NEAR INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY OF OXYGEN DELIVERY BY HEMOGLOBIN GIVES AN APPROXIMATION TO THE OXYGENATION OF THE CAPILLARY BED OF THECORTICAL LAYERS OF THE NEONATE BRAIN. SPEED OF RESPONSE OF THE OPTICAL METHOD IS HIGH (.1 SEC OR LESS), AND APPROPRIATETO SUDDEN CHANGES OF OXYGEN DELIVERY, FOR EXAMPLE, IN APNEA. HOWEVER, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OXYGEN DELIVERY AND ENERGY METABOLISM IS UNCERTAIN. PHOSPHORUS MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY GIVES PRECUSE AND CRITICAL INFORMATION OF THE ENERGY STATE OF THE BRAIN IN TERMS OF THEPHOSPHOCREATINE/PHOSPHATE RATIO, WHICH IS IN TURN RELATED TOTHE PHOSPHATE POTENTIAL (ATP/ADP X P(1)) (1). THE NMR METHOD IS NOT FAST, 5 MINUTES MAY BE REQUIRED FOR A DEFINITE VALUE, AND THUS, CANNOT SERVE AS A FAST \"EARLY WARNING\" OF HYPOXIC DISTRESS. THE DEVICE PROPOSED COMBINES TRANSCUTANEOUS INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY OF OXYGEN DELIVERY AS ARAPIDLY RESPONDING EARLY WARNING TOGETHER WITH PMRS AS A SLOWER, BUT MORE PRECISE, QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION OF DANGER. THESE TWO DEVICES IN COMBINATION CAN BE USED FOR THE INITIATION OF AGGRESSIVE THERAPY BY MANUAL AND AUTOMATICCONTROL OF THE OXYGEN DELIVERY TO THE BRAIN. THIS PHASE I APPLICATION HAS TO DO WITH TESTS OF SIMPLIFIED SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC TECHNIQUES FOR MEASUREMENT OF CAPILLARY BED OXYGENATION OF HEMOGLOBIN. TWO DEVICES ARE DESCRIBED, ONE EMPLOYING HOLOGRAPHIC GRATING MONOCHROMATORS AND THE OTHER TIME-SHARING INTERFERENCE FILTER SPECTROPHOTOMETRY.

ON-LINE ANAL-YSIS AND FEEDBACK CONTROL DEVELOPMENT WILL PERMIT INTEGRATEDAUTOMATIC CONTROL OF THESE INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES. THE SPECIFIC MOTIVATION FOR THIS WORK IS BASED ON THE NEED FOR SIMPLE, LOW COST INSTRUMENTS FOR \"SET-POINT\" CONTROL OF INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES. SUCH INSTRUMENTS COULD PROVIDE AN INTEGRATED TYPE OF MEASUREMENT THAT REPRESENTS AN OVERALL PROCESS AND EMISSIONS SUMMARY. A LARGE NUMBER OF THESE LOW COST, FIBER-OPTIC-BASED PROBES CAN BE MULTIPLEXED INTO A SINGLE SIGNAL PROCESSOR AND COMPUTER SYSTEM WHICH PERIODI-CALLY INTERROGATES ALL PROBES. THE INTEGRATED MEASUREMENT CAN THEN BE USED IN A FEEDBACK CONTROL SYSTEM TO 1) MAINTAINSTEADY PROCESS CONDITIONS AROUND AN EMPIRICALLY DETERMINED OPTIMUM CONDITION OR 2) TO DETECT UNDESIRABLE PROCESS AND EMISSIONS CONDITIONS. FOR DENSE FLOWS, THE INSTRUMENT CAN BE FIGURED TO HANDLE ENSEMBLE SCATTERING IN EITHER FORWARD BACKSCATTER CONFIGURATIONS. ENSEMBLE (MANY SCATTERS) TECH- NIQUES HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF FAST TIME RESPONSE AND CAN BE USED IN STEADY STATE OR TRANSIENT PROCESSES.

THE STRONG TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF THE SPONTANEOUS MAGNETIZATION (M) OF THE LATTER IN THE TYPICAL USE RANGE, O C TO +150 C, IS A PROBLEM IN MANY APPLICATIONS. (MS DROPS QUICKLY AS T INCREASES.) THIS CANNOT BE REMEDIED BY ALLOYING A HEAVY RARE EARTH INTO THE BASIC MAGNETIC PHASE AS IN SINTERED SM-CO-BASED MAGNETS. OUR APPROACH IS TO BLEND COARSE POWDERS OF THE MAIN MAGNETICCONSTITUENT (ND-FE-B OR SM-CO) AND A SECOND HARDMAGNETIC ALLOY THAT HAS A HIGH POSITIVE TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENT (TC) OF MS, THUS LESSENING THE VARIATION OF M WITH T FOR THE COMPOSITE, OR IN THE EXTREME MAKING MS NEARLY CONSTANT. THIS WOULD PERMIT CREATING A WHOLE FAMILY OF BONDED MAGNETS HAVING A RANGE OF TCS FROM ONLY 2 OR 3 MAGNETIC MASTER ALLOYS. THE METHOD IS EQUALLY APPLICABLE TO MATRIX MAGNETS WITH ANY KIND OF BINDER, POLYMERIC, METALLIC, OR OTHER. IT CAN ALSO BE USED TO COMPENSATE SM-CO-BASED MATRIX MAGNETS. IN PHASE I WE WOULD IDENTIFY SUITABLE COMPONENT ALLOY COMPOSITIONS (WHICH MUST BE AVAILABLE IN PRESINTERED FORM WITH HIGH COERCIVITY), ANALYZE THE PM PROPERTIES AND M VS. TOBTAINABLE FROM DIFFERENT BLENDS, AND DEVISE A MATHEMATICAL MODEL FOR \"ENGINEERING\" THE TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENT. WE WOULD PREPARE A COMPENSATION ALLOY, LEARN EXPERIMENTALLY HOWTO HARDEN IT, PREPARE SOME BONDED MAGNETS FROM POWDER BLENDSAND MEASURE THE TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF THEIR PM PROPERTIES TO PROVE FEASIBILITY OF THE CONCEPT AND VERIFY THE MATHEMATICAL MODEL.",

PUBLICATION DELAYS AND JOURNAL CAPACITY CAUSE A GROWING AMOUNT OF FUGITIVE RESEARCH LITERATURE. THE FIELD OF NURSING RESEARCH HAS REACHED STAGE 4. ARTICLES ACCEPTED FOR PUBLICATION WAIT TWO TO FOUR YEARS BEFORE THEY APPEAR IN PRINT. OTHER IMPORTANT RESEARCH SUCH AS DISSERTATIONS AND CONFERENCE PRESENTATIONS SIMPLY NEVER RECEIVE WIDER CIRCULATION. KNOWLEDGE ACCESS PROPOSES A PHASE I FEASIBILITY STUDY TO CONDUCT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TOWARD THE ESTABLISHMENT OFA NURSING RESEARCH ALERTING NETWORK (NRAN). THIS INCLUDES LOCATING THE RESEARCHERS, PROJECTS, AND REPORTS, DEVELOPING A PROTOTYPE NURSING RESEARCH DATABASE, DEVELOPING PRINT AND ELECTRONIC ACCESS, AND CONDUCTING FORMATIVE RESEARCH.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         EXIT-SITE TUNNEL INFECTIONS LEADING TO PERITONITIS ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPLICATIONS OF CONTINUOUS AMBULATORY PERI- TONEAL DIALYSIS (CAPD). AN IMPORTANT FACTOR CONTRIBUTING TOSUCH DIFFICULTIES IS THE INABILITY TO PREVENT BACTERIAL INVASION OF THE SITE WHERE THE CATHETER GIVING ACCESS TO THEPERITONEAL CAVITY PASSES THROUGH THE SKIN. L.VAD'S NEW APPROACH TO THE DESIGN OF A PERCUTANEOUS ACCESS DEVICE (PAD)RELIABLY CREATES A BIOLOGICAL SEAL AT THE JUNCTION OF THE IMPLANT AND THE SURROUNDING TISSUES THAT IS IMPERVIOUS TO PASSAGE OF MICROORGANISMS. TWO PRINCIPAL DESIGN FEATURES MINIMIZE THE COMPLICATIONS OF INFECTION AND EXTRUSION: (1) THE TRANSCUTANEOUS PORTION, OR NECK, OF THE PAD IS RENDERED NANOPOROUS. FIBROBLASTS FROM THE RECIPIENT'S DERMIS ARE CULTIVATED IN VITRO ON THE PAD NECK. THESE CELLS EXTEND PROCESSES INTO THE NONOPORES, PROVIDING A STRONG INTERLOCK. AFTER PAD IMPLANTATION, THE COATED CELLS MERGE WITH THE HOSTDERMIS. (2) A LARGE VELOUR-COVERED FLANGE ATTACHED TO THE PAD NECK IS USED TO ISOLATE THE SKIN-PAD INTERFACE FROM APPLIED FORCES. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO QUALIFY A PAD DESIGN FOR CLINICAL USE IN PERITONEAL DIALYSIS (D-PAD) AND TO BRING IT TO COMMERCIAL SALE. TOWARD THIS END, THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF PHASE I INCLUDE: (1) MAKING DESIGN MODIFICATIONS FOR TRANSFER OF FLUID AND IMPLANTATION OF THE DEVICE IN THE PERITONEUM; (2) ADAPTING PREVIOUS CELL CULTIVATION TECHNIQUES FOR THE D-PAD; (3) EVALUATING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PAD DESIGN IN ACUTE AND SHORT-TERM (3 MONTH) STUDIES; AND (4) EVOLVING THE EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN ANDPROTOCOLS FOR A COMPARATIVE LONG-TERM STUDY IN SWINE. IN PHASE II, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE D-PAD IN REDUCING EXIT SITE/TUNNEL INFECTION RATES WILL BE COMPARED WITH DESIGNS ALREADY COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE.",

IN ADDITION, THIS SAME DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM CAN BE USED TO DETERMINE OTHER KEY PLASMA AND FIELD DATA, AND, IN PRINCIPLE, CAN DO ALL OF THIS IN A DIRECT INTERPRETIVE WAY WITHOUT PERTURBING THE PLASMA. THE PHASE I RESEARCH PROGRAMWILL DETERMINE THE FULL ELECTROMAGNETIC ELECTRON FLUCTUATION SPECTRAL FUNCTION AND EVALUATE THE SCATTERING STRENGTH IN IMPORTANT PARAMETER REGIONS FOR ALPHA PARTICLE DETECTION. THESE RESULTS WILL ALSO BE ASSESSES FOR SENSITIVITY TO INHOMOGENEITIES BECAUSE SUCH REAL SYSTEM EFFECTS CAN CRITICALLY MODIFY THE QUANTITATIVE AND INTERPRETIVE NATURE OF THIS DIAGNOSTIC SCHEME. PLASMA AND FIELD INHOMOGENEITIES, FINITE DETECTOR DISTANCE AND RESOLUTION, INCIDENT AND SCATTERING WAVE REFRACTION, AND BACK-SCATTER OFF WALLS CAN PRODUCE STRONG COMPETING SCATTERED SIGNAL EFFECTS.

SHEARING CONDITIONS EXPERIENCED DURING TWIN SCREW MIXING CAN THEN BE MEASURED BY DETERMINING THE EXTEND OF MICROCAPSULE RUPTURE AND RELEASING THE TAGGANT. TAGGANT METHODS TO BE STUDIED INCLUDE DETECTION OF RUPTURED CAPSULES BY VISUAL METHODS (COLORED DYES), HALOGEN VAPOR DETECTION (REFRIGERANT SNIFFERS), SPECTROPHOTOMETRY, ORDOR AND FLUORESCENCE. SMALL QUANTITIES OF NON-HAZARDOUS SIMULATED PBX MIXTURES CONTAINING MICROENCAPSULATED TAGGANTS WILL BE TESTED UNDER VARYING SHEAR RATE CONDITIONS IN A SMALL LABORATORY TWIN SCREW MIXER WITH INSTRUMENTATION.

VARIOUS TYPES OF SUCH SCANNERS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED OVER THE PAST 40 YEARS BUT HAVE LARGELY BEEN IGNORED RECENTLY IN FAVOR OF ALL ELECTRONIC SCANNING - FOR REASONS OF BULK, WEIGHT, SCAN SECTOR AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, BEAM AGILITY. BUT, IN MOST BATTLEFIELD RADAR APPLICATIONS (WEAPON LOCATION EXCLUDED) AGILITY IS NOT REQUIRED. WITH THIS FACT IN MIND, WE HAVE RE-EXAMINED THE APPLICABILITY OF ELECTRO-MECHANICAL SCANNERS TO THE RADAR CUER PROBLEM. THERE IS ONE ELECTRO-MECHANICAL SCANNER CONCEPT IN PARTICULAR, THE WORK WAR II EAGLE SCANNER, THAT IS A PRIME CANDIDATE FOR USE IN THIS APPLICATION. THE EAGLE SCANNER HS SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES OVER THE ELECTRONIC PHASED ARRAY ANTENNA IN TERMS OF COST AND SIDELOBE PERFORMANCE. CONSEQUENTLY, WE BELIEVE THAT THE EAGLE SCANNER SHOULD BE EVALUATED AS A COST AND PERFORMANCE EFFECTIVE SOLUTION TO THE RADAR CUER PROBLEM.

THE DEVICE EMPLOYES A HOT-FILM ANEMOMETER TO SENSE TOTAL LOCAL AIRFLOW VELOCITY. THE TOTAL AIRFLOW VELOCITY IS THEN REDUCED TO TWOCOMPONENTS; THE TIME AVERAGE VELOCITY FIELD (U) AND THE ROOTMEAN SQUARE VELOCITY FLUCTUATIONS (URMS). THE RATIO OF THESE COMPONENTS (URMS/U) HAS A SIMPLE CORRESPONDENCE TO TURBULENCE INTESNITY WHICH, IN TURN, IS RELATED TO THE STALL OF AN AIRFOIL. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS SYSTEM IS THAT IT PROVIDES A DIRECTMEASURE OF THE LOCAL AIR VELOCITY OVER AN AIRFOIL, AND CAN THUS SENSE TURBULENCE PRECEEDING A STALL REGARDLESS OF THE STATUS OF THE WING, I.E.-ICE OR FROST, LEADING EDGE SLATS UPOR DOWN, OR ANY CONDITION THAT CHANGES THE NORMAL AIRFOIL SHAPE. IT IS A DIRECT MEASURE OF STALL CONDITIONS COMPARED TO SECONDARY DEVICES SUCH AS ANGLE-OF-ATTACK OR STAGNATION POINT SENORS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS TECHNICAL PROJECT IS TO EVALUATE THE HOTFILM ANEMOMETER TO ALLOW DETERMINATION OF THE PARAMETERS NEEDED FOR A SENSOR PROVIDING THE SAME QUANTITIES, BUT MORE RELIABLE IN OPERATIONAL USE.

PRIOR RESEARCH AND ACTUAL MANUFACTURING EXPERIENCE SHOW INERTIAL WELDING (ONE KIND OF FRICTION WELDING) IS THE BEST PROCESS FOR PRODUCING BIMETALLIC GEARS TO MEET THE ABOVE CRITERIA. HOWEVER, THERE IS A TECHNOLOGICAL LIMIT IN THE SIZE OF TITANIUM-STEEL INERTIAL WELDED JOINTS BEYOND WHICH BRITTLE INTERMETALLIC PHASES DETERIORATE JOINT MECHANICAL PROPERTIES. PHASE I RESEARCH WOULD INCLUDE INERTIA WELDING GEAR BLANKS CONTAINING AN ALUMINUM ALLOY INTERFACE TO OVERCOME WELD JOINT BRITTLENESS SO THAT CONVENTIONALLY-SIZED GEARS CAN BE PRODUCED. TITANIUM-TO-STEEL WELD JOINTS WOULD BE MADE WITH AND WITHOUT ALUMINUM, TORSION TESTED, AND MICROSTRUCTURALLY EXAMINED TO DETERMINE THE QUALITY OF THE INERTIA WELDED GEAR BLANKS.

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE SCOPE OF THIS PROJECT IS TWOFOLD. ONE PART COMPRISES A STUDY OF A FOCAL PLANE IMAGING SYSTEM TO BE USED FOR PLASMA DIAGNOSTICS. PLASMA IS MEASURED AT SUBMILLIMETER WAVELENGTHS (FREQUENCIES ABOVE 300 GHZ) BY INTERFEROMETRY AND AT MILLIMETER WAVELENGTHS (30-300 GHZ) BY REFLECTOMETRY AND SPECTROMETRY. ONE DRAWBACK WITH THESE TECHNIQUES IS THAT ONLY A SINGLE DATA POINT CAN BE MEASURED IN A GIVEN TIME FRAME. FOCAL PLANE IMAGING IS A TECHNIQUE ENABLING THEUSER TO FORM A TWO-DIMENSIONAL MAP OF THE PLASMA, ALLOWING OBSERVATIONS OF SHORT DEVIATION PHENOMENA OVER A LARGE FIELDOF VIEW. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE OTHER TECHNIQUES, FOCAL PLANE IMAGING IS THE OPTIMUM METHOD BECAUSE THE USE OF QUASIOPTICAL COMPONENTS WOULD REDUCE LOSSES AND CAUSE NO PHASING PROBLEMS. THE REALIZATION OF THIS TECHNIQUE REQUIRES A NEW GENRE OF COMPONENTS THAT WILL BE DEVELOPED IN THE SECOND PART OF THIS PROJECT. MICROWAVE TEST COMPONENTS ARE ABUNDANT IN WAVEGUIDE BANDS THROUGH WR-6. ABOVE THESE FREQUENCIES, WHERE MANY PLASMA EXPERIMENTS ARE CONDUCTED, DEVICES SUCH AS ISOLATORS AND CIRCULATORS TEND TO BE LOSSY AND NARROW BAND BECAUSE OF SMALL SIZE, TOLERANCES, AND MATERIALS LIMITATIONS. GAUSSIAN OPTICS COMPONENTS ARE A PROMISING ALTERNATIVE TO THEIR WAVEGUIDE COUNTERPARTS. THESE DEVICES UTILIZE THE PROPAGATION OF A GAUSSIAN BEAM THROUGH FREE SPACE WITHOUT THE PROPAGATING ENERGY BEING CONFINED BY METALLIC OR DIELECTRIC BOUNDARIES. THE DEVICES MAY BE COUPLED TO A WAVEGUIDE SYSTEM BY A SCALAR FEEDHORN OR THEY MAY BE PART OF A SYSTEM CONSISTING ENTIRELY OF BEAM WAVEGUIDE. THE ADVANTAGES OF BEAM WAVEGUIDE OVER NORMAL WAVEGUIDE ARE LOW LOSS AND HIGH POWER HANDLING CAPABILITIES. FARADAY ROTATION ISOLATORS ANDCIRCULATORS WITH GAUSSIAN OPTICS WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR LOW POWER USE IN THE NEAR MILLIMETER AND SUBMILLIMETER WAVELENGTH REGIONS. HEXAFERRITE ISOLATORS AND AN OPTICAL PRECISION ATTENUATOR WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR USE BELOW 100 GHZ. THE SPECIFICATIONS AND PERFORMANCE OF THE IMAGING SYSTEM WILL THEN BE DETERMINED.",

THE TEST ELECTRONS ARE DEFLECTED IN A MEASURABLE WAY BY THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS OF THE BEAM UNDER TEST, AND THE DIRECTION AND MAGNITUDE OF THE DEFLECTION ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL CHARGE DISTRIBUTION OF THE BEAM. THIS DIAGNOSTIC TOOL HAS THE ADVANTAGES THAT IT DOES NOT PERTURB THE ELECTRON BEAM AND THAT IT OFFERS THE POSSIBILITY OF RESOLVING BEAM PARAMETERS ON THE TIME SCALE OF THE MICROBUNCH IN AN RF ACCELERATOR. FURTHERMORE, A VARIETY OF DETECTORS CAN BE USED TO MONITOR THE DEFLECTED BEAM, DEPENDING ON THE TIME RESPONSE AND SPATIAL RESOLUTION REQUIRED. TRAJECTORY CALCULATIONS HAVE BEEN PERFORMED FOR THE TEST PARTICLES, INDICATING THAT RELATIVELY LOW ENERGY TEST ELECTRONS (10-50 KEV) CAN BE USED TO DIAGNOSE THE BEAM. THESE ELECTRONS ARE DEFLECTED BY LARGE AMOUNTS (>1 CM) BY ELECTRONMICROBUNCHES WITH TOTAL CHARGE ON THE ORDER OF A NANOCOULOMB AND PULSE DURATION ON THE ORDER OF 10 PSEC.

THEY HAVE THE ADDED ADVANTAGES OF BACK-LASH FREE OPERATION, LOW NOISE AND VIBRATION, NO GEAR COGGING AND SMOOTH TORQUE TRANSFER IN BIDIRECTIONAL OPERATION. PRESENTLY USED PLANETARY GEAR SYSTEMS SUFFER FROM EITHER BACK-LASH OR LOSS OF EFFICIENCY, WHILE HARMONIC DRIVES COG IN REVERSE. FURTHER BENEFITS IN COMPACTNESS (HIGH TORQUE CAPABILITY) WITHOUT SACRIFICE OF THE INHERENT ADVANTAGES CAN BE ACHIEVEDBY COMBINING TRACTION ROLLERS AND GEARS. A TYPICAL DRIVE (FIGURE 2) EMPLOYS A PLANETARY ARRANGEMENT OF GEARS AND ROLLERS CONSISTING OF A SUN ROLLER GEAR, TWO CONCENTRIC CLUSTERS OF STATIONARY ROLLER GEAR PLANETS AND A RING GEAR. THE LOW TORQUE, HIGH SPEED INPUT IS SUPPLIED TO THE SUN, AND THE HIGH TORQUE, LOW SPEED OUTPUT IS TAKEN FROM THERING GEAR. ROLLER DIAMETERS ARE NOMINALLY EQUAL TO GEAR PITCH DIAMETERS WITH A PRELOAD AT ASSEMBLY WHICH SLIGHTLY EXCEEDS THE GEAR SEPARATING FORCE. THIS INSURES THAT THE ROLLERS WILL NOT SEPARATE AND CAUSE BACKLASH OR CHATTER. THE GEAR TEETH TRANSMIT PURELY TANGENTIAL FORCES. A SPECIFIC DRIVE RATIO, TORQUE REQUIREMENT AND SPEED WILL BE CHOSEN FOR STUDY. FINAL DESIGNS WILL BE WORKED OUT FOR TWO DRIVES OF HIGH MODULUS STEEL, ONE WITH DRY FILM AND ONE WITH GREASE LUBRICATION. DRIVE KINEMATICS, SIZE, LIFE AND EXPECTED PERFORMANCE WILL BE FULLY DEFINED.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         THERE IS INCREASING INTEREST WITHIN THE HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS COMMUNITY IN INVESTIGATING ELECTRON INTERACTION PHENOMENA ATENERGIES NEAR 1 TEV. A LINEAR COLLIDER, HAVING A DESIGN BASED ON THE RELATIVISTIC KLYSTRON TWO-BEAM ACCELERATOR (RK/TBA) DESCRIBED BY SESSLER AND YU, OFFERS A PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE APPROACH TO ACHIEVING SUCH ENERGIES. IN THIS APPROACH, HIGH ENERGY, LOW CURRENT ELECTRON BEAMS ARE ACCELERATED USING THE MICROWAVE FIELDS GENERATED BY CO-MOVING ELECTRON BEAMS IN THE RELATIVISTIC KLYSTRON CONFIGURATION. HIGH ACCELERATING GRADIENTS OF 200 MV/M ARE ESSENTIAL IN ORDER TO DESIGN A REASONABLY-SIZEDMACHINE THAT IS ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE. HOWEVER, THIS IMPLIES PEAK RF DRIVE POWERS OF 1 GW PER METER OF HIGH ENERGY ACCELERATOR LENGTH. THERE ARE MANY ISSUES TO BE RESOLVED IN ORDER TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF THE RK/TBA APPROACH. CRITICAL ISSUES THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED IN THIS PROJECT INCLUDE REACCELERATION OF THE LOW-ENERGY RK BEAM AFTER MICROWAVE EXTRACTION AND DEVELOPMENT OF LOW COST LINEAR INDUCTION ACCELERATOR/RELATIVISTIC KLYSTRON DESIGNS. IN THE PHASE I WORK IT IS PLANNED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE LOW COST 1.5 MEV, 2 KA ACCELERATOR DEVELOPED BY PULSE SCIENCES, INC. HAS SUFFICIENTLY GOOD BEAM EMITTANCE FOR USE IN A RK/TBA; TO STUDY TECHNIQUES FOR FURTHER REDUCING THE COST OF A RK/TBA; AND TO DESIGN A SIGNIFICANT PHASE II EXPERIMENT THATWILL DEMONSTRATE CRITICAL RELATIVISTIC KLYSTRON REACCELERATION ISSUES. VALUABLE INTERACTIONS WITH THE HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS COMMUNITY AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ACCELERATOR COMMUNITY ARE ALSO PLANNED.",

THIS DETECTION WILL BE EITHER OF INDIVIDUAL DRUGS OR SIMULTANEOUSLY OF 1 OR MORE DRUGS IN A PANEL OF UP TO 50 DRUGS, AND WILL TAKE LESS THAN 30 SECONDS. SIMULTANEOUS DETECTION WILL BE DONE ON A SINGLE SPECIMEN WITHOUT ANY SAMPLE PREPARATION OR SAMPLE VOLUME MEASUREMENT. THERE ARE TWO SPECIFIC AIMS. THE FIRST IS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF ORD'S FFIA METHOD FOR THE DETECTION OF CANNABINOIDS. THE PROPOSED SENSITIVITY GOAL IS 10 NG/ML OF THE TETRAHYDRO-CANNABINOL (THC) URINARY METABOLITE. ALTHOUGH AN ASSAY IS PROPOSED FOR URINARY METABOLITES, ORD'SMETHOD HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR MEASURING THE FREE DRUG DIRECTLY IN A DROP OF WHOLE BLOOD WITHOUT ANY SEPARATION STEPS. THE SECOND SPECIFIC AIM IS TO MODIFY THE FFIA INSTRUMENT FOR AN INVESTIGATION INTO OPTIMIZING FIBER AREA TO ALLOW FOR THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF DRUGS TO BE DETECTED SIMULTANEOUSLY.",

SUCH AN IMPROVED DETECTOR SYSTEM IS CAPABLE OF REMOVING SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS IMPOSED BY PRESENT DETECTORS ON MATERIAL RESEARCH AT SYNCHROTRON RADIATION FACILITIES AND INTENSE NEUTRON SOURCES. THE INCREASE IN COUNT-RATE CAPABILITY IS MADE POSSIBLE BY COMBINING A DETECTOR TECHNOLOGY THAT USES ONE OUTPUT CHANNELPER PIXEL WITH A NOVEL CHARGE-CENTROID-FINDING METHOD THAT IS CAPABLE OF OPERATING AT COUNT RATES OF 10(5) PHOTONS OR NEUTRONS PER SECOND PER PIXEL. THE DETECTOR ENDURANCE IN HIGH INTENSITY SOURCE ENVIRONMENTS IS IMPROVED BECAUSE THE LOW OUTPUT CHARGE REQUIREMENT OF 10-(14)C PER DETECTED EVENTINCREASES DETECTOR LIFE BY MITIGATING EROSION AND RADIATION DAMAGE PROBLEMS. WITHIN THE SCOPE OF PHASE I, A PROTOTYPICAL, MULTIWIRE DETECTOR SYSTEM WILL BE INSTRUMENTEDTO STUDY THIS NOVEL APPROACH AND DETERMINE ITS POTENTIAL FOR ADVANCING THE STATE OF THE ART OF DETECTORS FOR SCATTERING AND DIFFRACTION OF NEUTRONS AND PHOTONS IN MATERIALS SCIENCE APPLICATIONS WITH HIGH INTENSITY SOURCES.

THE NOVEL DESIGN FOR THE SKIMMING FLASH PYROLYZERIS AN ADD-ON SYSTEM TO PREHEAT THE COAL EN ROUTE TO THE FURNACE OF THE POWER PLANT. IN THIS WAY, THE COAL UTILIZATION IS UP TO 90% (AS COMPARED TO ABOUT 50% FOR CURRENT COAL LIQUEFACTION PROCESSES), THE SYSTEM CAPITAL COST IS GREATLY REDUCED, AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THE OVERALL COAL UTILIZATION ARE MINIMIZED. A SIDE STREAM OF 900 DEGREES CENTIGRADE LIME-ASH-CHAR MIXTURE FROM THE TOP OF A FLUIDIZED-BED COAL FURNACE WILL BE DIVERTED TO A NON-OXIDIZING VIBRATORY PYROLYZER INTO WHICH A STREAM OF CRUSHED COAL IS FED.

THE REASON FOR EMPLOYING ULTRASONICS IS TO OBTAIN THE REQUIRED PERFORMANCE WHILE AVOIDING THE LIMITS ON OTHER SENSORS CAUSED BY THEIR USE OF MOVING PARTS, FLOW-RESTRICTIVE ORIFICES, OR SENSITIVE SURFACES WHOSE HEAT TRANSFER PROPERTIES ARE LIKELY TO DEGRADE QUICKLY IN THE HOSTILE HIGH-TEMPERATURE (250 TO 350 DEGREES CENTIGRADE) DOWNHOLE ENVIRONMENT. A SPECIAL ADVANTAGE OF ULTRASONICS IS ITS ABILITY TO MEASURE ANNULAR FLOW QUADRANT-BY-QUADRANT. SUCH PROFILE DATA COULD CONTRIBUTE UNIQUELY TOWARD UNDERSTANDING THE ORIENTATION OF DOWNHOLE FISSURES. THE REASON FOR INVESTIGATING AS MANY AS FOUR MODES IN PHASE I IS THAT EACH IS SUITED FOR ONLY PART OF THE FLOW RANGE OR FLOW CONDITIONS. FROM AMONG SEVERAL PIEZOELECTRIC TRANSDUCERS WHOSE CRITICAL TEMPERATURE IS 400 DEGREES CENTIGRADE OR HIGHER, ONE MUST BE SELECTED THAT IS MOST EASILY ADAPTED TO CONFIGURATIONS REQUIRED BY THE FOUR MODES. IDEALLY, SEVERAL MODES WOULD SHARE PAIRS OF TRANSDUCERS. TESTS OF THE NONELECTRONIC PORTION OF THE FLOW TOOL WILL BE CONDUCTED TO 350 DEGREES CENTIGRADE. AT ROOM TEMPERATURE, ANNULAR FLOW SYSTEM TESTS WILL BE CONDUCTED QUADRANT-BY-QUADRANT FROM 0.05 TO 5 FT/S, A 100:1 RANGE, IN A 6 IN. PIPE. A COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE ELECTRONIC INSTRUMENT ALREADY OPERATES IN MULTIPLE MODES, BUT IT NEEDS TO BE REPACKAGED IN PHASE II TO MEET THE THERMAL, CHEMICAL, PRESSURE, MONOCONDUCTOR, SMALL DIAMETER AND OTHER DOWNHOLE REQUIREMENTS.

THEREFORE, STRIVING TO ACHIEVE A HIGHER LEVEL OF POLLUTANT REMOVAL BY INCREASING THE PLATINUM AND RHODIUM CONTENTS IN THE THREE-WAY CATALYST IS NOT ECONOMICALLY ATTRACTIVE. IN THIS RESEARCH, AN ALTER-NATIVE METHOD FOR ACHIEVING A HIGHER LEVEL OF POLLUTANT RE- MOVAL IS PROPOSED, IN WHICH BY USING YTTRIA-STABILIZED-ZIR- CONIA (YSZ) AS THE SUPPORT MATERIAL, INSTEAD OF ALUMINA USED AT THE PRESENT TIME, THE ACTIVITY OF THE THREE-WAY CAT-ALYST CAN BE NEARLY DOUBLED. IN PHASE I OF THE PROPOSED STUDY, THE MAGNITUDE OF THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YSZ AS A SUPPORT MATERIAL WILL BE STUDIED. PHASE II OF THE STUDY BE DEVOTED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CONVERTER IN THE FORM OF A WASHCOATED LAYER OF YSZ ON A CONRDIERITE MONOLITH, WITH THE PLATINUM AND RHODIUM CRYSTALLITES DEPOSITED IN THE YSZ LAYER IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THIS WORK WILL LEAD TO THE DEVELOP-MENT OF AN IMPROVED THREE-WAY CATALYST FOR THE TREATMENT OF AUTOMOBILE EXHAUST. THE CATALYST WILL ACHIEVE A SUBSTAN- TIALLY HIGHER LEVEL OF POLLUTANT REMOVAL FOR THE SAME CONCENTRATION OF ACTIVE METALS. FURTHER-MORE, THE OXYGEN-ION CON-DUCTING SUPPORT, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ENHANCED PER- FORMANCE OF THE NEW CATALYST, WILL BE USED ONLY SPARINGLY. CONSEQUENTLY, THE NEW CATALYST WILL COST ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THE CURRENTLY-USED THREE-WAY CATALYSTS. HENCE, THE CATALYST IS EXPECTED TO BE READILY MARKETABLE.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A NEW COUNTERCURRENT CHROMATOGRAPHY INSTRUMENT, THE CROSS-AXIS FLOW-THROUGH COIL PLANET CENTRIFUGE IS PROPOSED FOR THE PREPARATIVE CHROMATOGRAPHY OF PEPTIDES. THIS IS AN APPARATUS THAT SEPARATES SUBSTANCES ACCORDING TO THEIR PARTITIONING IN A LIQUID-LIQUID EQUILIBRATION SYSTEM WITHOUTTHE USE OF A SOLID-PHASE SUPPORT. THE INSTRUMENT WILL BE TESTED IN THE PURIFICATION OF LARGE QUANTITIES OF SYNTHETIC PEPTIDES, USING DIFFERENT CONDITIONS AND SOLVENT SYSTEMS TO ACHIEVE HIGH RESOLUTION AND RECOVERY. THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF THIS INSTRUMENT WOULD MAKE AVAILABLE A LOWER COST TECHNOLOGY FOR CHROMATOGRAPHIC PURIFICATION. THE IMPEDIMENTS ENCOUNTERED IN THE TREATMENT OF HUMAN BRAIN ENCEPHALITIS HAVE SO FAR BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO THE INABILITY OFANTIVIRAL AGENTS TO REACH THE VIRAL SITE IN THE CNS. TO CIRCUMVENT THESE PROBLEMS UTILIZATION OF THE BRAIN-SPECIFIC CHEMICAL DELIVERY SYSTEM (ANALOGOUS TO THE NAD NADHREDOX SYSTEM) DEVELOPED BY BODOR AND ASSOCIATES IS PROPOSED. THIS SYSTEM IS BASED ON THE INTERCONVERSION OF LIPOPHILIC DIHYDROPYRIDINES WHICH READILY CROSS THE BBB BETWEEN HYDROPHILIC PYRIDINIUM SALTS WHICH ARE LOCKED IN THEBRAIN. THE ADVANTAGES OF THIS SYSTEM ARE 1) LOWER PERIPHERAL CONCENTRATIONS OF THE ACTIVE AGENT AND CONSEQUENTLY REDUCED SYSTEMIC TOXICITY 2) GREATER EFFICACY SINCE A LOWER DOSE CAN BE GIVEN TO ATTAIN CLINICALLY EFFECTIVE CEREBRAL CONCENTRATIONS. THE MAJOR AIM OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO APPLY THE CHEMICAL DELIVERY SYSTEM TO SELECTED ANTIHERPETIC AGENTS. THE AREAS OF RESEARCH IN PHASE I WOULD INCLUDE SYNTHESIS OF DRUG-CARRIER SYSTEMS, DEVELOPMENT OF SUITABLE ANALYTICAL SYSTEMS, DETERMINATION OFSTABILITY IN VITRO USING VARIOUS MATRICES TO ESTABLISH THE RATE AT WHICH THE FREE DRUG IS RELEASED FROM THE CARRIER.

THE SENSING ELEMENT IS THE GROUND ITSELF SINCE GROUND CONDUCTIVITY (RESISTANCE -1) CHANGES WHEN COMPRESSED BY THE WEIGHT OF AN OBJECT. USING ADVANCED SIGNAL PROCESSING TECHNIQUES, THE SENSOR TRANSLATES THE CHANGE IN GROUND CONDUCTIVITY INTO A WARNING SIGNAL THAT CAN BE CALIBRATED TO RECOGNIZE INDIVIDUALS, SMALL ANIMALS, VEHICLES, ETC. BY SETTING A THRESHOLD LEVEL THE SENSOR CAN BE USED AS AN INTRUSION DETECTOR TO PROTECT TACTICAL EQUIPMENT; A COMPLETE PERIMETER AROUND AN AREA CAN BE COVERED BY THE SENSOR SYSTEM USING SEVERAL SMALL, PORTABLE UNITS. THE SENSOR SYSTEM DOES NOT USE RADIATED FIELDS AND SHOULD BE TOTALLY TRANSPARENT TO DETECTOR BY HOSTILE FORCES. INSTALLATION, CHECKOUT, CALIBRATION AND OPERATION OF THE SENSOR SYSTEM CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED BY A SMALL TEAM (2-3 MEN) IN LESS THAN TWO HOURS FOR A PERIMETER OF A FEW KILOMETERS.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, THE EPA HAS DEVOTED MAJOR EF- FORTS TO IDENTIFY AND DOCUMENT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE RISKS OFENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION DUE TO LEAKING UDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS (UST). IN APRIL 1987, THE EPA PUBLISHED THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS FOR THE OWNERS AND OPERATORS OF UST, WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE FINALIZEDD IN EARLY 1988. THESE REGULATIONS INCLUDE REQUIREMENTS FOR TANK TIGHTNESS TESTS, DAILY INVENTORY CONTROL PROCEDURES AND STRICT FINAN- CIAL RESPONSIBILITIES. THE FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS TO SER- VICE STATION OWNERS ARE SIGNIFICANT. THE ADVANCED CONCEPT TO BE EVALUATED FOR ITS FEASIBILITY IN THIS PHASE I EFFORT IS AN INNOVATIVE, COST EFFECTIVE COMBI- NATION OF AN IMPROVED INVENTORY CONTROL SYSTEM, IMPROVED IN-STRUMENTATION FOR AUTOMATIC TANK GAGING AND A COMPREHENSIVE STATISTICAL MODEL. THE MODEL ACCOUNTS FOR ALL APPLICABLE ERROR SOURCES IN EACH TRANSACTION INTO OR OUT OF THE UNDER- GROUND TANK IN REAL-TIME, ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS. WITH THE IMPROVED SYSTEM AND INSTRUMENTATION, THE DATA FROM A NON- LEAKING TANK AND PIPING SYSTEM WILL ALWAYS FALL WITHIN A RELATIVELY NARROW STATISTICAL BAND. HOWEVER, A LEAK WILL APPEAR AS A BIAS, OVER TIME, TO THE LOWER SIDE OF THE ERROR BAND, WITH THE MAGNITUDE OF THE BIAS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THESIZE OF THE LEAK. THE PROJECT OBJECTIVES ARE DESIGNED TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY AND THE ACCURACY OF THE SYSTEM TO PROVIDE TANK AND PIPING LEAK DETECTION TO EPA AND NFPA STANDARDS, ON A CON- TINUOUS BASIS, WHILE PROVIDING THE ADVANTAGES OF AUTOMATIC GAUGING AND CONTINUOUS INVENTORY CONTROL. SPECIFIC TECHNI- CAL OBJECTIVES CONSIDER EACH ELEMENT OF THE SYSTEM. IF THE FEASIBILITY OF THE CONCEPT IS DEMONSTRATED, THEN THE SYSTEM WILL OFFER STATION OWNERS AN INTEGRATED SENSOR PACK- AGE WITH MICROPROCESSOR CONTROL THT MEETS THE EPA PROPOSED REGULATIONS FOR BOTH INVENTORY CONTROL, TANK TIGHTNESS TEST-ING, AND PIPING LEAK DETECTION ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS. IT REMOVES HUMAN GAUGING ERRORS, ACCURATELY ACCOUNTS FOR TANK TRUCK DELIVERIES, PROVIDES SECURITY AGAINST THEFT AND ALLOWSCENTRALIZED MONITORING, BY PHONE LINES OR RADIO, OF INDIVIDUAL SERVICE STATIONS. THE COST IMPLICATIONS ARE SO LOW THAT THE OLDER SERVICE STA-TION OWNERS COULD AMORTIZE THE COST IN APPROXIMATELY ONE AND PROVIDE COST SAVINGS THEREAFTER.",

TO DATE, ONLY EMPIRICAL APPROACHES TO ACHIEVING OXYGEN ADDITION HAVE BEEN REALISED, WITH QUALITY CONTROL CRUDE AND UNREPRODUCIBLE EXCEPT WITHIN VERY BROAD LIMITS. A MEANS IS BEING EXAMINED FOR INTRODUCING, DETERMINING, AND CONTROLLING THE OXYGEN CONTENT OF A CONVERTER IN A VERY PRECISE WAY THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF AN ELECTROCHEMICAL CELL. THE USE OF SUCH CELLS FOR OXYGEN TRANSFER, MEASUREMENT, AND CONTROL IS WELL UNDERSTOODAND ESTABLISHED, BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN APPLIED TO THESE PURPOSES IN THE THERMIONIC CONVERTER. A FEASIBILITY EXPERIMENT AND EVALUATION OF APPLYING THIS TECHNOLOGY IS BEING CONDUCTED, WHICH, IF SUCCESSFUL, WOULD LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INTEGRATED CONVERTER IN A LATER EFFORT. THE PRIMARY APPLICATION OF THE THERMIONIC CONVERSION PROCESS IS PRESENTLY IN IN-CORE THERMIONIC SPACE POWER REACTORS, ALTHOUGH A COMPARABLE PROCESS HAS RECEIVED CONSIDERATION IN THE PAST AS A TOPPINGCYCLE FOR COMMERCIAL POWER PLANTS.",

IT IS A SIGNIFICANT OUTDOOR AND INDOOR AIR POLLUTANT. AUTOMO ARE THE MJOR SOURCE OF OUTDOOR CARBON MONOXIDE, AND IT IS EMITTED AT THE HIGHEST RATE DURING THE FIRST FEW MINUTES WHEN THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER IS NOT ACTIVE. MAJOR SOURCES OF INDOOR POLLUTION ARE APPLIANCES AND CIGARETTES. CONCEN- TRATIONS IN ENCLOSED SPACES SUCH AS ENERGY EFFICIENT HOMES AND BUILDING AND AIRCRAFT CABINS CAN BE HIGH BECAUSE OF THE REDUCED AIR CIRCULATION RATE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO DEVELOP MATERIALS WHICH SEL-ECTIVELY ADSORB CARBON MONXIDE AT LOW TEMPERATURES, AND RE- LEASE IT AT HIGH TEMPERATURES. SUCH MATERIALS COULD REDUCE EMISSIONS DURING COLD OPERATION OF AUTOMOBILES BY TRAPPING CARBON MONOXIDE IN THE EXHAUST AND HOLDING IT UNTIL THE CAT-LYST HAS REACHED OPERATIONG TEMPERATURE. IN CLOSED EVNIRON MENTS, THE ADSORBENT WOULD CONCENTRATE THE CARBON MONOXIDE SO THAT IT CAN BE MORE EFFICIENTLY REMOVED OR OXIDIZED. SEVERAL DIFFERENT CARBON MONOXIDE ADSORBING MATERIALS WILL BE FABRICATED AND TESTED FOR ADSORPTION CAPACITY, SELECTIVITY, AND STABILITY, AND AN APPLICATIONS ANALYSIS WILL BE CONDUCT TED TO DETERMINE THE NOST PROMISING APPLICATIONS FOR THESE MATERIALS.",

MANY HOURS ARE PRESENTLY SPENT IN MODELING SUCH PROBLEMS. THE PROPOSED STRUCTURAL ZOOMING SYSTEM (SZS) WILL SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE COST AND INCREASETHE ACCURACY OF SUCH ANALYSES. THE CENTRAL CONCEPT, AS INTRODUCED HERE, IS SIMPLE, AND IS COINED \"STRUCTURAL ZOOMING\". THIS CONCEPT APPROACHES THE PROBLEM OF MODELING A LARGE COMPLEX OBJECT (THE \"PARENT\" OBJECT) BY RECURSIVELY ANALYZING SMALLER PORTIONS (\"CHILD\" OBJECTS) OF THE PARENT. GEOMETRICAL AND MESH REFINEMENTS MAY BE INTRODUCED FOR EACH SUCCESSIVE ANALYSIS. AFTER AN ANALYSIS OF THE PARENT, A CHILD IS EXTRACTED. BOUNDARY CONDITIONS DERIVED FROM THE PARENT ANALYSIS ARE APPLIED TO THE CHILD AT THE PARENT/CHILD INTERFACE, AND THE CHILD IS ANALYZED. OVERALL ACCURACY IS IMPROVED USING AN ITERATIVE ALGORITHM INVOLVING REANALYSIS OF BOTH THE PARENT AND CHILD OBJECTS TO REDUCE DISEQUILIBRIUM AT THE INTERFACE (CAUSED BY \"BACK-COUPLING\" EFFECTS). FINALLY, THE METHOD IS RECURSIVE -- A GRANDCHILD,GREATGRANDCHILD OBJECTS, ETC., CAN BE DEFINED IF RESPONSES ON MORE REFINED GEOMETRICAL SCALES ARE REQUIRED. PHASE I RESEARCH WILL ADDRESS THE FEASIBILITY OF STRUCTURAL ZOOMING. A TWO-DIMENSIONAL PROTOTYPE, CONSISTING OF A NUMBER OF DISTINCT SOFTWARE MODULES, WILL BE DEVELOPED. PHASE II WILL DEVELOP A COMPLETELY INTEGRATED STRUCTURAL ZOOMING SYSTEM FOR TWO- AND THREE-DIMENSIONAL OBJECTS, UTILIZING SOFTWARE DESIGNS AND RECOMMENDATIONS DEVELOPED DURING PHASE I.",

A RESEARCH PROGRAM IS PROPOSED TO FULFILL THIS VOID AND TO ASSIST IN THE IMMEDIATE AVAILABILITY OF DEOXYNUCLEOSIDES. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH CONSISTS OF SEVERAL SEGMENTS; A) LARGE-SCALE PRODUCTION OF DNA FROM SALMON, B) ENZYMATIC HYDROLYSIS OF DNA TO MONONUCLEOSIDES FOLLOWED BY DEPHOSPHORYLATION TO A DEOXYNUCLEOSIDE MIXTURE, C) SEPARATION OF DEOXYNUCLEOSIDES WITHOUT INVOLVING SALTS, FOLLOWED BY CONCENTRATION OF THE MATERIAL AND D) QUALITY CONTROL FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION OF ISOLATED DEOXYNUCLEOSIDES.

IN PHASE I OF THE PROJECT WE PROPOSE TO SYNTHESIZE FLUORESCENT PROBES AS A NOVEL APPROACH TO MONITORING DOPAMINE RECEPTOR MOBILITY IN BRAIN MEMBRANES. FLUORESCENT COMPOUNDS WILL BE COUPLED TO DOPAMINE AGONISTS (THERAPEUTIC DRUGS FOR PARKINSON'S DISEASE) AND ANTAGONISTS (THERAPEUTIC AGENTS FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA). WE WILL TEST THE AFFINITY AND SELECTIVITY OF THESE COMPOUNDS FOR DOPAMINE RECEPTORS. NEURAL MEMBRANES AT VARIOUS LEVELS OF TISSUE ORGANIZATION WILL CONSEQUENTLY BE EXPOSED TO THE FLUORESCENT PROBE, PHOTOBLEACHED BY LASER BEAM, AND THE RECOVERY OF FLUORESCENCE WILL BE MONITORED BY FLUORESCENT MICROSCOPY. THESE COMPOUNDS WILL PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED INFORMATION ON THE MOBILITY OF DOPAMINE RECEPTORS OCCUPIED BY THERAPEUTIC DRUGS.",

THE SECOND SYSTEM PROPOSED IS MUCH SIMPLER AND CHEAPER TO IMPLEMENT BUT OF ADEQUATE ACCURACY TO DETERMINE THE DIFFERENTIAL GROUP DELAY TO CALIBRATE THE DIFFERENTIAL CARRIER PHASE FOR ABSOLUTE VALUE OF ELECTRON CONTENT. IN BOTH SYSTEMS, THE DIFFERENTIAL CARRIER PHASE AND SIGNAL AMPLITUDES ARE ALSO MEASURED. THE PARAMETERS PROVIDE NECESSARY INFORMATION ON IONOSPHERIC IRREGULARITIES AND DISTURBANCES.",

THE FLYING PLATE DETONATOR, HOWEVER, HAS CHANGED LITTLE SINCE ITS ORIGINAL DEVELOPMENT BY LAWRENCE LIVERMORE LABORATORIES. ALTHOUGH EVOLUTIONARY CHANGES HAVE REDUCED ITS FIRING ENERGY REQUIREMENTS, THE SIZE OF SUPPORTING COMPONENTS STILL REMAINS A PROBLEM IN SMALL MISSILE APPLICATIONS. OUR PROPOSAL IS CHARACTERIZED BY TWO MAIN FEATURES, BOTH OF WHICH OFFER SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL REDUCTION IN FIRING ENERGY. FIRST, WE PROPOSE TO USE MICROMACHINING TECHNIQUES TO BUILD AND ASSEMBLE MINIATURIZED, PRECISION-MACHINED DETONATOR COMPONENTS.

THE ARCHITECTURE FEATURES A NEW CONCEPT IN THE DESIGN OF CONTENT ADDRESSABLE MEMORIES (CAM). THIS CAM WILL FUNCTION AS THE HEART OF A NOVEL ASSOCIATIVE PROCESSOR THAT EFFICIENTLY EXECUTES THE SETI PATTERN RECOGNITION ALGORITHMS. THE CAM ARCHITECTURE USES HIGHLY PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED PROCESSING IN A CUSTOM VLSI IMPLEMENTATION TO SUPPORT QUERY DIRECTED, ASSOCIATIVE COMPUTATION. THE SETI APPROACH FOR FINDING EXTRATERRESTRIAL ARTIFICIAL SIGNALS INVOLVES THE DETECTION OF PATTERNS OF WEAK NARROW BAND SIGNALS AMONG A LARGE NUMBER OF NOISY NARROWBAND CHANNELS. THE PATTERNS OF INTEREST ARE EITHER CONTINUOUS WAVE, OR PULSE MODULATED SIGNALS THAT MAY DRIFT SLOWLY IN FREQUENCY. THE ASSOCIATIVE PROCESSOR PROPOSED HERE SUCCESSFULLY RECOGNIZES THESE PATTERNS OF ARTIFICIAL SIGNALS OBSCURED BY NOISE, AND REPLACES ALL COMPETING ALTERNATIVES IN PERFORMANCE, SIZE AND COST. FABRICATION OF LARGE-SCALE SETI SYSTEMS, SUCH AS 500 MILLION CHANNEL SPECTROMETERS, NOW BECOMES PRACTICAL WHEN THE DESIGN EMPLOYS THIS NEW CONCEPT IN ASSOCIATIVE COMPUTATION.",

IT WOULD USE A COMBINATION OF PROVEN SENSOR HEAD AND INNOVATIVE, NEAR INFRARED, DIODE LASER TECHNOLOGIES. THIS COMBINATION PERMITS OPERATION OF SEVERAL SENSOR HEADS CONNECTED BY OPTICAL FIBERS TO A SINGLE LASER/DETECTOR/ELECTRONICS PACKAGE, WHICH POTENTIALLY OFFERSLOWER SENSOR COSTS (AND, THEREBY, APPLICABILITY TO A WIDER RANGE OF INDUSTRIAL USERS) THAN EXISTING DESIGNS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMMERCIAL SENSOR FOR MONITORING AND CONTROLLING HUMIDITY IN INDUSTRIALDRYING CHAMBERS. AS A FIRST STEP TOWARDS THIS GOAL, A LABORATORY PROOF-OF-CONCEPT BREADBOARD WILL BE CONSTRUCTED IN PHASE I TO INVESTIGATE THE FUNDAMENTAL LIMITATIONS ON SENSITIVITY, SELECTIVITY, AND LINEARITY FOR WATER VAPOR DETECTION. IN PHASE II, A BRASSBOARD FIBER OPTIC LASER ABSORPTION WATER SENSOR (FLAWS) INSTRUMENT WILL BE CONSTRUCTED AND TESTED IN AN INDUSTRIAL DRYING CHAMBER, PROBABLY IN THE PULP AND PAPER INDUSTRY.",

SEVERAL MODIFICATIONS OF THIS INTEGRATED LAMBDA VECTOR ARE PROPOSED THAT WILL ALLOW RAPID DNA SEQUENCE ANALYSIS OF MUTATIONS WITHIN THE TARGET GENE (LAC 1 REPRESSOR GENE). AFTER EXPOSURE TO A MUTAGEN, DNA SAMPLES ARE PREPARED FROM MOUSE TISSUES. PHAGE DNA IS RECOVERED DIRECTLY FROM THE MOUSE GENOMIC DNA UTILIZING STRATAGENE CLONING SYSTEMS' LAMBDA PACKAGING EXTRACTS. AFTER PLATING, PHAGE-CONTAINING MUTATIONS WITHIN THE TARGET ARE EASILY IDENTIFIED BY COLOR ASSAY. NEXT, THE MUTANT TARGET GENE IS AUTOMATICALLY EXCISED FROM THE LAMBDA PHAGE AND CONVERTED INTO A PLASMID UTILIZING SPECIFIC SITES IN THE LAMBDA PHAGE AND REPLICATIONPROTEINS DERIVED FROM THE BACTERIOPHAGE M13. THE CLASS OF VECTORS INCORPORATING THIS CONVERSION PROCESS HAS BEEN TERMED LAMBDA ZAP. THE NEW MUTAGENIC TEST VECTOR WILL BE CONSTRUCTED AND THEN MICROINJECTED INTO MOUSE EMBRYOS.

THE HEMISPHERE IS APPROXIMATELY EIGHT INCHES IN DIAMETER, WEIGHING LESS THAN FOUR POUNDS. THE SURFLACE HAS DIRECTIONAL HOLES THROUGH WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL SENSORS LOOK. THESE DETECTORS ARE SPACED AT ANGULAR INTERVALS SUCH THAT ANY DISTANT POINT OF LIGHT IS OBSERVED BY SEVERAL NEIGHBORING DETECTORS. A SIMPLE CENTROID ALGORITHM CALCULATES THE DIRECTION OF THE SOURCE TO AN ACCURACY OF BETTER THAN ONE DEGREE IN SOLID ANGLE FROM THE OBSERVED DISTRIBUTION OF SIGNAL INTENSITIES THE ANGULAR DETECTOR ARRAY IS SUPPLEMENTED WITH A SET OF DETECTOR CLUSTERS WHICH ANALYZE THE FREQUENCY SPECTRUM AND THE TEMPORAL VARIATIONS IN LIGHT INTENSITY. INFORMATION FROMTHE CLUSTERS IS USED TO RECOGNIZE THE ONSET OF MONOCHROMATICLIGHT. THIS APPROACH LEADS TO A SIMPLE, RUGGED, NON-IMAGINGDETECTOR CAPABLE OF RECOGNIZING AND LOCATING A LASER THREAT IN LESS THAN ONE MILLISECOND.

DESCRIPTION: COOPERATIVE ENGAGEMENT, AS ADDRESSED HEREIN, USES ONE AIRCRAFT TO PROVIDE TARGETING FOR, AND INFLIGHT CONTROL OF MISSILES LAUNCHED BY ANOTHER AIRCRAFT. IN EFFECT THIS CHANGES THE LAUNCH ACCEPTABILITY REGION (LAR) OF THE MISSILE.

THE RESULTING SLURRY CAN BE TRANSPORTED THROUGH A PIPELINE AND INJECTED DIRECTLY INTO A BOILER FOR COMBUSTION. PULVERIZING COAL INTO A FINE POWDER LEADS TO GREATER ASH REJECTION LEVELS AND THEREFORE TO CLEANER COAL. THIS PROJECT PROVIDES A NEW APPROACH TO COAL COMMINUTION BY USING HIGH ENERGY ELECTRIC SPARKS IN WATER TO GENERATE SHOCK WAVES THAT FRACTURE AND PULVERIZE THE COAL. SPECIFIC EXPERIMENTS WILL BE CONDUCTED ON AN EXISTING PULSED POWER FACILITY, DEVELOPED UNDER SEPARATE FUNDING FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE COAL PULVERIZATION PROCESS USING THE ELECTROHYDRAULIC EFFECT. WORK WILL BE DONE WITH THE NEW MEXICO INSTITUTE OF MINING TECHNOLOGY IN COMPARING THE COMMINUTION RESULTS FROM THE HIGH ENERGY ELECTRIC SPARK TECHNIQUE TO CONVENTIONAL CRUSHING TECHNIQUESUNDER CAREFULLY CONTROLLED CONDITIONS. THE DATA FROM THESE TESTS WILL PROVIDE A BENCH MARK FOR EVALUATING THE EFFICIENCY AND ECONOMY OF THE NOVEL PROCESS FOR PULVERIZING AND CLEANING COAL IN THE 2-20 MICRON SCALE SIZE.",

THE PROJECTILES WOULD BE BOOSTED INTO 120 MINUTE ORBITS BY SMALL SOLID ROCKETS. THE PROJECTILES COULD BE CALLED DOWN INDIVIDUALLY BY FORCES UNDER ATTACK BY PROGRAMMING DE-ORBIT BURNS FOR PROJECTILES NEARING THE TARGET. THE PROJECTILES WOULD STEER IN AIR TO IMPACT THE TARGET. THE ABILITY TO BUILD UP AND REDUCE AT WILL, THE STORE OF KINETIC WEAPONS IN LOW EARTH ORBIT COULD HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT ON THE AGGRESSOR BECAUSE THESE WEAPONS WOULD BE VISIBLE WITH FIELD GLASSES AT NIGHT.

THE ADVANTAGES IN THIS APPROACH TO COAL DEGRADATION ARE THAT HIGH TEMPERATURES AND PRESSURES ARE NOT REQUIRED FOR PRODUCING SOLUBLE FUEL PRODUCTS. THE REACTIONS WILL BE CONDUCTED IN ORGANIC SOLVENTS RATHER THAN IN WATER AS IS DONE WITH MOST ENZYMATIC REACTIONS. ALTHOUGH IMPROVEMENTS IN COAL PROCESSING MAY RESULT, PRETREATMENTS OF THE COALS ARE NEEDED TO OBTAIN SUITABLE SUSPENSIONS IN THE ORGANIC SOLVENTS. METHODS FOR PREPARING AND STABILIZING THESE SUSPENSIONS WILL BE INVESTIGATED ALONG WITH STUDIES OF DETAILS OF THE ENZYMATIC DEGRADATIONS. FINALLY, THE CHANGESIN THE SOLUBILITY OR THE SUSPENDABILITY OF THE PRODUCTS OF THE ENZYME-CATALYZED REACTION WILL BE DETERMINED. THE SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION OF BIOTECHNOLOGY TO COAL CONVERSION DEPENDS ON NEW KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF HOW ENZYMES REACT WITH THE COAL MACROMOLECULES AND HOW TO FACILITATE THIS INTERACTION. THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP THE BASIC KINETIC PARAMETERS OF ENZYMATIC DEGRADATION OF COAL SUBSTRATES, WHICH ARE NECESSARY FOR EVALUATING THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THESE PROCESSES INTO LIQUID FUEL PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY.",

THE RHEOMETER IS DESIGNED TO MEASURE ACCURATELY THE VISCOSITY OF MUNITION PROPELLANTS BEING EXTRUDED BY A TWIN-SCREW EXTRUDER. THE PROPELLANT EXTRUDATE IS A PSEUDOPLASTIC FLUID CONTAINING SUSPENDED SOLIDS. THE POISEULLE METER IS AN ACCURATE RHEOMETER FOR PSEUDOPLASTIC EXTRUDATES AND CAN BE IMPLEMENTED AS AN ON-LINE DEVICE. THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH PROGRAM ALSO DEVELOPS A PRELIMINARY CONTROL STRATEGY USING THE POISEULLE METER FOR FEED-BACK CONTROL AT THE EXTRUDER.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE AND DEVELOP A PARALLEL OUTPUT IMAGING SENSOR BASED ON A CUSTOM MOS INTEGRATED CIRCUIT. THE SENSOR WILL HAVE AN IMAGING RESOLUTION OF APPROXIMATELY 256 X 256 PIXELS AND OPERATE AT FRAME RATES GREATER THAN 2000 FRAMES/SECOND. THE HIGH BANDWIDTH REQUIREMENTS WILL NECESSITATE PARALLEL OUTPUTS FROM THE CHIP, PERHAPS AS MANY AS ONE OUTPUT PER ROW OF SENSORS. OUR APPROACH WILL UTILIZE STANDARD READILY AVAILABLE CMOS BULK INTEGRATED CIRCUIT TECHNOLOGY SO PRODUCTS ARISING FROM THE R&D; CAN BE FABRICATED RELIABLY AN CHEAPLY BY A NUMER OF VENDORS. WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE FEASIBILITY OF FABRICATING PHOTOSENSOR ARRAYS USING STANDARD CMOS PROCESSES. A SMALL CIRCUIT ASSOCIATED WITH EACH PHOTOSENSOR IN THE ARRAY PROVIDES A LOGARITHMIC OUTPUT THAT EXTENDS THE DYNAMIC RANGE OF LIGHT INTENSITIES TO GREATER THAN 10,000. OUR ASSOCIATES AT CALTECH HAVE BUILT AND DEMONSTRATED CMOS SCANNING ARRAYS AT NORMAL VIDEO RATES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF A HIGH SPEED PARALLEL OUTPUT VIDEO CAMERA IS A NATURAL EXTENSION OF THIS PRIOR WORK AND LEADS DIRECTLY TO AN INEXPENSIVE PRODUCT WITH WIDE APPLICABILITY IN COMMERCIAL, ACADEMIC, AND MILITARY MARKETS.",
