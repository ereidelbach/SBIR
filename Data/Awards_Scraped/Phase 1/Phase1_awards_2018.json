        "abstract": "Abstract         Project Summary Abstract Combining high channel count electrophysiological recording of neural activity with patterned electrical micro  stimulation has been severely constrained by technical limitations  Foremost among these limitations are the problems associated with simultaneous recording and micro stimulation  Stimulation artifacts are up to four orders of magnitude larger than the neural signal being sensed  The large signal drives the amplifiers outside of their linear range and traditional AC coupled amplifiers require long settling times to recover  These long settling times are due to long time constants created by low frequency high pass filters  One traditional approach to avoid amplifier saturation is to employ switches for electrode  headstage amplifier  and stimulator connections to rapidly switch between recording and stimulation  Switches must be employed to disconnect the stimulator when recording to avoid amplifier saturation and degrading the high impedance electrode signal from parasitic cable capacitances and interference sources  This project will develop a research tool for neuroscientists that will achieve electrical stimulation and neural signal recording from the same microelectrode  Multiple channels of simultaneous recording and micro stimulation from the same electrode are combined on the same integrated circuit  IC  for integration in a headstage  The integration in an IC eliminates signal degradation and interference from cabling and switching parasitic effects  Additionally  the low noise amplifier circuitry  stimulation circuitry and local control may be intimately tied to mitigate the electrode polarization recovery Project Narrative A greater understanding of the neuronal mechanisms underlying cognitive function is unlikely to emerge until several technical hurdles can be overcome  New instruments are needed to characterize the relationships between cognitive behaviors and the spatiotemporal patterns of neuronal activity in the distributed circuits that mediate those behaviors  These approaches must be combined with the ability to make specific and targeted manipulations of neuronal activity to establish causal physiological links between behavior and network dynamics",

        "abstract": "Abstract         No other group of diseases encompasses a greater pathophysiology than do the rheumatic diseases  Spanning multiple organ systems  clinical decisions often rely on coordinated efforts from primary care providers and rheumatologists to rule in or rule out differential diagnoses when treating inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis  RA  and systemic lupus erythematosus  SLE   RA is a symmetric  inflammatory  peripheral polyarthritis leading to deformity of joints via erosion of bone and surrounding cartilage  SLE can affect virtually any organ leading to fatigue  fever  myalgia  weight change and complications associated with renal  central nervous system  and hematologic systems can be life threatening  RA and SLE are diagnosed through clinical judgment after excluding alternative diagnoses  In the case of both diseases  individual laboratory tests are effective only in a portion of the disease population  In RA  testing for rheumatoid factor and anti CCP antibodies provide very important information when positive  However  these two analytes remain negative in      of patients and continue to be negative throughout diagnostic follow up in     of patients with RA  Further  erythrocyte sedimentation rates  ESR  and c reactive protein  CRP  levels are generally strongly correlated with radiographic findings of joint damage  These measurements  however  can be elevated by other infectious and inflammatory processes that are not specific for RA or can be altered  in the case of ESR  by acute phase reactants from malignancy  tissue injury  or trauma  In SLE  exclusion of markers diagnostic for RA coupled with presence of markers measuring antinuclear antibodies  ANA  and followed by assays measuring double stranded DNA  dsDNA   anti Sm  anti Ro SSA  anti La SSB  anti U  RNP  or antiribosomal P are frequently used  Across these analyses  the sensitivity and specificity for these laboratory measurements vary greatly and many have high specificity to rule in SLE but lack sensitivity as these diagnostic markers can be found in other disorders  For instance  anti Ro anti La are found in Sjogrenandapos s syndrome and anti U  RNP is frequently associated with mixed connective tissue disease  As a physician colleague pointed out   it is difficult to diagnose a negative   Thus  diagnostic approaches for both RA and SLE often rely on multiple  independent laboratory tests combined with clinical observation  Distinguishing between these diseases is important  as the treatment procedures for these diseases are different  Time is a frequent factor in the diagnosis of these diseases and tools are needed to facilitate earlier diagnosis as treatment for autoimmune diseases are highly effective and early initiation of therapy leads to the best outcomes  Misdiagnosis of these conditions is also not uncommon   Another common disease seen by rheumatologists is fibromyalgia syndrome  FMS   FMS is a common cause of widespread musculoskeletal pain that affects tendons  ligaments  and muscle  FMS is difficult to diagnose and treat and a critical clinical point is that FMS is not explained by another rheumatic or systemic disorder  Thus  FMS is a diagnosis of exclusion once other etiologies have been considered and excluded  RA and SLE are two diseases that must be eliminated from the differential diagnosis  Given the complicated diagnostic process these patients are often forced to endure  recent studies have also suggested that healthcare dollars are saved post diagnosis and patient outcomes improve  To date  there is no laboratory test that can determine presence or absence of these three conditions from a single blood sample   The question of whether or not disease classifiers capable of providing clinically useful information could be built based upon disease specific expression levels of mRNAs in whole blood has been a subject of research for greater than ten years  Many disease specific gene expression signatures have been identified in the research lab  A few of these have even progressed into commercially viable diagnostic tests  notably for systemic sclerosis   Long non coding RNAs  lncRNA  are recently discovered regulatory RNA molecules that do not code for proteins but influence a vast array of biological processes  In vertebrates  the number of lncRNA genes greatly exceeds the number of protein coding genes  It is also thought that lncRNAs drive greater biologic complexity between vertebrates and invertebrates  These lncRNAs also show much greater cell type specific expression patterns than mRNAs  Humans also develop many more complex diseases than other organisms  As such  our data presented in preliminary studies  support the notion that disease associated lncRNAs exhibit far greater differences in expression than disease associated mRNAs  In this application  we propose to explore the hypothesis that lncRNAs are better biomarkers of human disease than mRNAs  Here  we will focus on FMS and rheumatic diseases as disease categories and have identified FMS and rheumatic disease  associated differentially expressed lncRNAs  Study of lncRNAs in human autoimmune disease is in its infancy and exploration of lncRNAs as biomarkers of autoimmune disease has not been previously addressed  We propose the following specific aim  To identify annotated and novel lncRNAs differentially expressed among CTRL  FMS  RA  and SLE and assess their function as biomarkers to distinguish FMS  RA  and SLE subjects from healthy subjects and subjects with other rheumatic diseases Diagnosis of fibromyalgia syndrome and other rheumatic diseases can be a difficult  long and costly process and misdiagnosis of these diseases is not uncommon  Long non coding RNAs  lncRNA  are a new class of regulatory RNA molecules that exhibit high degrees of cell type specific expression  The hypothesis we will test in this application is that measurement of expression of disease specific lncRNAs in rheumatic diseases and fibromyalgia syndrome will have greater utility to provide meaningful clinical information to health care providers faced with these diagnostic dilemmas than measurement of disease specific mRNAs",

        "abstract": "Abstract         Abstract The study of protein ligand binding is one of the central problems in computational biology because of its importance in understanding intermolecular interactions  and because of its practical payoff in drug discovery efforts  The transformative impact accurate target ligand structure can have in the design of next generation medicines cannot be overstated  If we could routinely and accurately design molecules using these approaches it would revolutionize drug discovery by winnowing out compounds with no activity while focusing more effort and scrutiny on highly active compounds  Determining the structure of a small molecule  drug candidate or lead compound  bound to a biological receptor  protein implicated in disease  is a necessary step in this approach to drug discovery  X ray techniques provide astounding insights into the structure of protein  ligand complexes  but can be hampered by the resolution to which a crystal diffracts and the refinement process can be hampered by the lack of good potentials for novel small molecule compounds  We have extended our linear scaling semiempirical quantum mechanical  QM  X ray refinement approach and applied it to this field with great success  This approach has proven itself to be robust enough for routine QM based X  ray refinement and it is currently being successfully marketed  However  since refinement methods are ultimately built on optimization algorithms and do not include sampling  they all suffer from what is termed a  limited radius of convergence   Therefore  crystallographic workflows   automatic and manual   include ligand placement as part of the model building process  Conventional automatic procedures for ligand placement are resolution dependent and are unable to take into account the chemistry of the active site  Further  the ligand conformation is often so highly strained that X ray refinement alone  is unable to deduce the proper structure  When this happens  significant intervention on the part of the crystallographer is required  which increases expense and decreases productivity  In this proposal we describe a novel method we call Movable Type  MT   which addresses the protein ligand binding and scoring problem using fundamental statistical mechanics combined with a novel way to generate the ensemble of a ligand in a protein binding pocket  Via a rapid assembly of the necessary partition functions we directly obtain binding free energies and the low free energy poses  Conceptually  the MT method is analogous to block and type set printing  which allows us to efficiently evaluate partition functions describing regions or systems of interest  In this approach we construct two databases that    describe the probability of certain pairwise interactions as a function of r obtained from a knowledge base  Protein Databank  PDB  or the Cambridge Structural Database  CSD   and    the energetics of the pairwise interactions as a function of r obtained from empirical potentials  which can be either derived from the probabilities or can utilize extant pairwise potentials like AMBER  Overall  the MT method is a general one and can use a broad range of two  body potential functions and can be extended to higher order interactions if so desired  In this project we will extend the MT method and deliver this methodology to X ray crystallographers and computational chemists for use in automated ligand placement within the experimental density during X ray refinement  This work will involve development of a new  automated tool to find the active site ligand density and place the ligand within that density using the MT method  We will commercially deploy the technology  construct graphical user interfaces for use in MOE  Phenix  and our web based cloud platform  Finally  this software will be used in real life structure based drug discovery problems with our pharmaceutical collaborators  see Letters of Support  Project Narrative We will enhance and deploy the movable type method to address the prediction of small molecule binding to drug targets  The resultant methodology and computer program will impact our ability to rapidly and routinely identify biologically active molecules than could be useful in the treatment of a number of diseased states",
