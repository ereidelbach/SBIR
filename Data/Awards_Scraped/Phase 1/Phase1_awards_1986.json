THIS RESEARCH DESCRIBES A TECHNIQUE OF USING COMPTOM SCATTERED X-RAYS IN AN IPSILATERAL (BACKSCATTER) GEOMETRY TO OBTAIN THREE-DIMENSIONAL DENSITY INFORMATION FORMAXILLODENTAL IMAGING. THE TECHNIQUE IS CALLED COMPTON SCATTER TOMOGRAPHY (CST). CURRENTLY, IN THIS ANATOMICAL REGION, ONLY TWO-DIMENSIONAL SUPERPOSITION SHADOWGRAPHS (STANDARD RADIOGRAPHY) ARE USED FOR OTHER THAN EXCEPTIONAL CASES. COST, RADIATION DOSE, AND AVAILABILITY OF FACILITIESARE THE MAJOR IMPEDIMENTS TO USING CST OR NMR MORE ROUTINELY. IT IS PROPOSED TO DEVELOP A LOWER COST, MEDIUM RESOLUTION (1MM) IMAGING DEVICE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A STANDARDX-RAY UNIT WITH A PROJECTED PATIENT DOSE OF 300MREM. FROM THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL DATA, NONSUPERPOSITION, TWO- DIMENSIONAL CROSS-SECTIONS OF ARBITRARY ORIENTATION WILL BE DISPLAYED ON A CRT MONITOR. IN PHASE I RESEARCH, DESIGN TRADEOFFS WILL BE STUDIED WITH COMPUTER SIMULATIONS. THEN TWO SIMPLE GEOMETRIC OBJECTS WILL BE IMAGED TO VERIFY THE TECHNIQUE. PHASE II WILL BUILD A PROTOTYPE. CST IS BEST SUITED FOR IMAGING NEAR THE SURFACE, SO APPLICATION AREAS OTHER THAN MAXILLODENTAL MAY BE OTORHINOLARENGOLOGY, SPINAL IMAGING, AND ORTHOPEDICS.",

SPF REQUIRES LOW FORMING PRESSURE, HAS EXCELLENT SHAPE CAPABILITY AND IS APPLICABLE TO WELL ESTABLISHED TI-6AL-4V. BUT, IT REQUIRES COSTLY TOOLING AND HEATING SYSTEMS. THE PROPOSED PROGRAM WILL INVESTIGATE A NOVEL CONCEPT FOR HEATING AND TOOLING SYSTEMS FOR SUPERPLASTIC FORMING. THE TITANIUM SHEET WILL BE HEATED DIRECTLY WITH LOW HEAT LOSS TO TOOLING. THE PROCESS WILL BE ENERGY EFFICIENT, REDUCE USAGE OF HEAT RESISTANT MATERIALS FOR TOOLING AND ELIMINATE NEED FOR LARGE PRESSES. THE PROCESS FEASIBILITY WILL BE EVALUATED BY MAKING 6 IN. DIAMETER HEMISPHERES FROM 0.070 IN. THICK TI-6AL-4V. PARAMETERS SUCH AS WORK MATERIAL AND TOOLING TEMPERATURES, FORMING PRESSURE AND DEFORMATION WILL BE MONITORED.

IT IS BECOMING RECOGNIZED WITHIN THE NAVY THAT A \"FORCE MULTIPLIER\" IS NEEDED BY THE SMALLSHIP COMMANDER TO ENHANCE HIS OPERATIOAL READINESS THROUGH THE INTELLIGENT COLLECTION/DECIPHERING/DISSEMINATION OF BATTLEFIELD C3I AND BY RESOLVING SENSOR DERVIED INFORMATION, FOR INSTANCE, INTERPRETING RADAR IMAGES FOR TARGET DETECTION, LOCALIZATION, AND CLASSIFICATION. THE FEASIBILITY OF SYNTHESIZING THE FOLLOWING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)-BASED SITUATION ASSESSMENT AID TO THE NAVY COMMANDER WOULD BE INVESTIGATED IN THIS PROPOSED WORK: SITUATION ASSESSMEN AID (SAA) BASED ON MULTISENSOR INTEGRATION (MSI) AND \"EXTRA-SIGNAL\" INTELLIGENCE CORRELATION USING TOOLS OF \"PERCEPTUAL REASONING\" AND \"EVIDENTIAL SUPPORT\". THE SAA WOULD HAVE SOME LIMITED LEARNING CAPABILITY AND BE INTERACTIVE WITH THE USER. THE SAA WILL BE DEVELOPED ON AKM ASSOCIATES MICROVAX II AI-WORKSTATION WITH MICROVMX-3 OPERATING SYSTEM AND USING THE VAXLISP LANGUAGE. SUCH AN IMPLEMENTATION WILL BE COMPLETELY PORTABLE TO ANY NAVY FACILITY HAVING A VAX/VMS COMPUTER SYSTEM. THE OVERALL SYSTEM WILL BE DEVISED SO THAT THE HARDWARE/ SOFTWARE PERFORMS ALL FEASIBLE MACHINE OPERATIONS WHILE THE SHIP COMMANDER RENDERS ONLY NECESSARY DECISIONS AND MACHINE INPUT (INSTRUCTIONS).",

TARGET IDENTIFICATION WHICH INVOLVES COMPLEX HUMAN DECISION MAKING IS NOT VERY RELIABLE UNDER THE STRESS OF COMBAT ENGAGEMENT, EVEN THOUGH A DISTINCT AND UNAMBIGUOUS TARGET IMAGE IS AVAILABLE. IN MANY PRACTICL APPLICATIONS OF AUTOMATED VISION, THE EXACT SHAPE OF THE OBJECT TO BE RECOGNIZED IS KNOWN IN ADVANCE. FOR THE U.S. ARMY, IN MOST INSTANCES, THE BATTLEFIELD TARGETS TO BE RECOGNIZED WILL BE COMBAT AND TRANSPORT VEHICLES, MISSILE AND GUN CARRIERS, AND INFANTRY SUPPORT HELICOPTERS AND AIRCRAFT. IN THIS KIND OF SITUATION, IT IS DESIRABLE AND POSSIBLE TO SPLIT THE COMPUTATION INTO TWO STATES: A MODEL-BUILDING STAGE IN WHICH USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT THE UNCHANGING TARGET CHARACTERISTICS IS COMPILED, AND AN EXECUTION STAGE IN WHICH THIS INFORMATION IS EXPLOITED FOR THE RAPID RECOGNITION OF TARGETS OF INTEREST IN THE IMAGE. THE RESULT OF OUR PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL BE A FAST, MACHINE-VISION PROGRAM FOR RECOGNIZING AND LOCATING BATTLEFIELD TARGETS IN IMAGES WITHOUT RESTRICTION ON THE ORIENTATION OF THE TARGETS IN SPACE. SUCH AN ARTIFICAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)-BASED PROGRAM WITH A HEURISTIC DATABASE WILL BE DEVELOPED ON A 32-BIT MICROPROCESSOR (E.G., MICROVAX II) AND WOULD EVENTUALLY RESIDE INSIDE A COMBAT OR VERY INTELLIGENT SURVEILLANCE AND TARGET ACQUISITION (VISTA) VEHICLE.",

THESE ALGORITHMS DETERMINE OPTIMAL COUNTERMEASURE SEQUENCES BY PREDICTING IN REAL-TIME HOW THREATS WILL RESPOND TO COUNTERMEASURES. IN SIMULATIONS AGAINST A PARTICULARLY LETHAL ANTI-AIRCRAFT ARTILLERY (AAA) SYSTEM, OUR PREDICTIVE ALGORITHM REDUCED THE EXPECTED KILL PROBABILITY BY OVER 50 PERCENT WITH RESPECT TO NON-PREDICTIVE ALGORITHMS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CONCEPTS WE PIONEERED FOR OUR ECM POWER MANAGEMENT ALGORITHM CAN BE THE BASIS FOR A LARGE, MORE COMPREHENSIVE MULTI-SPECTRAL COUNTERMEASURE SYSTEM. FOREMOST AMONG THESE CONCEPTS ARE ALGORITHMS TO PREDICT, IN REAL-TIME, THREAT TRACKING/FIRING STATES, LOOK-AHEAD ALGORITHMS TO PREDICT HOW A THREAT WILL RESPOND TO A FUTURE SEQUENCE OF COUNTERMEASURES, AND ALGORITHMS TO EXPLOIT COLLATERAL COUNTERMEASURE APPLICATION. WE PROPOSE AN EXPLORATORY RESEARCH EFFORT TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF EXTENDING OUR CONCEPTS TO THE RANGE OF THREATS AND RADIO-FREQUENCY/ELECTRO-OPTICAL/ INFRARED COUNTERMEASURES ENVISIONED FOR YEAR 2000 AND BEYOND.",

THESE COMPOUNDS INDUCE THE PRODUCTION OF FETAL HEMOGLOBIN WHEN ADMINISTERED TO EITHER BABOONS OR HUMAN PATIENTS WITH BETA THALASSEMIA OR SICKLE CELL ANEMIA. AS THIS THERAPY MAY BECOME MORE WIDELY USED, IT IS IMPORTANT TO DETERMINE WHICH OF THESE DRUGS HAS NO LONG-TERM RISK. DURING PHASE I RESEARCH, THE FOUR COMPOUNDSWILL BE TESTED FOR THEIR ABILITY TO CAUSE CHROMOSOMAL DAMAGEIN BONE MARROW CELLS OF RATS. ANIMALS WILL BE SACRIFICED 24HOURS FOLLOWING A DOSE ADMINISTERED BY ORAL GAVAGE. BONE MARROW CELLS WILL BE PROCESSED THROUGH HYPOTONIC AND FIXATIVE, AND CHROMOSOMAL DAMAGE WILL BE ASSESSED IN META- PHASE CELLS. IN ADDITION, THREE OF THE COMPOUNDS, HYDROXY- UREA, CYTOSINE ARABINOSIDE, AND DEOXYAZACYTIDINE, WILL BE TESTED IN 14-DAY TOXICOLOGY STUDIES. THESE THREE COMPOUNDS WILL BE ADMINISTERED TO BOTH MICE AND RATS 5 DAYS A WEEK FOR2 WEEKS. BODY WEIGHT, FOOD CONSUMPTION, AND CLINICAL EXAMINATION OF MAJOR ORGANS WILL BE OBTAINED FOR THE HIGH SURVIVING DOSE GROUP AND THE NEGATIVE CONTROLS. THE RESULTSOF THESE 14-DAY STUDIES WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE THE DOSES THAT CAN BE USED FOR SUB-CHRONIC 90-DAY STUDIES AND FOR CHRONIC 2-YEAR CARCINOGENICITY STUDIES. 5-AZACYTIDINE WILL NOT BE TESTED IN A 14-DAY STUDY DURING PHASE I, AS IT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY TESTED UNDER THESE CONDITIONS, AND THE DATA FOR SELECTING DOSES FOR A 2-YEAR CANCER STUDY ARE AVAILABLE.DURING PHASE II, SUB-CHRONIC AND CHRONIC CANCER STUDIES WILLBE PERFORMED ON THE DRUGS.",

THIS NEW PATENTED TECHNOLOGY IS AN OIL EMULSION OF DEFINED DROPLET SIZE (100 TO 200 MM) HAVING A SMOOTH, PLIABLE, AND TRANSPARENT SURFACE. THE PROTEIN AT THE OIL EMULSION INTERFACE CAN DIRECTLY SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF TRANSFORMED CELLS, OR THESE LAYERS CAN BE DESIGNED TO CONTAIN PROTEINS IMPORTANT TO THE ATTACHMENT AND SPREADING OF NORMAL OR MALIGNANTLY TRANSFORMED CELLS. ABC, LTD., WILLPREPARE MC OIL EMULSION MICROCARRIERS CONDUCTIVE TO THE ATTACHMENT AND GROWTH OF HUMAN TUMOR CELLS IN THIS PHASE I PROJECT. THE NEW MC SYSTEM WILL BE COMPARED TO THE CURRENT TWO-LAYER SOFT AGAR CLONING METHODOLOGY USING PRIMARY TISSUE SAMPLES OBTAINED FROM PATIENTS AT SURGERY. THE PROTOTYPE OIL EMULSION MC WILL BE OF VALUE TO CLONING AND PROPAGATING PRIMARY HUMAN TUMORS FOR USE IN CHEMOSENSITIVITYASSAYS. IN ADDITION, THIS TECHNOLOGY CAN PROVIDE A SOURCE OF TUMOR CELL ANTIGENS FOR PREPARING MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES FOR TUMOR-SPECIFIC IMMUNOTHERAPY. PHASE II WILL INVOLVE THEAPPLICATION OF THE MC TECHNOLOGY TO THE THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS STATED IN THE AREAS OF CHEMOSENSITIVITY AND IMMUNOTHERAPY.",

THESE ION SURFACES ALLOW ALTERATIONS IN THE FIBROUS CAPSULE FORMATION; THE ALTERATIONS PERMIT INTIMATE CONTACT WITH THE TISSUE VASCULATURE TO THE EXCLUSION OF THE FIBROUS CAPSULE. THE SENSING ELEMENT IS CONSTRUCTED WITH AN EXCLUSION MEMBRANE SYSTEM, BIBULOUS FILMWITH ENZYME SOLUTION AND PLATINUM CATALYTIC SURFACE, THUS COMBINING UNIQUE SURFACE MICROSTRUCTURING WITH A RECHARGEABLE ENZYME SYSTEM. DURING PHASE I A PROTOTYPE MODULE WILL BE TESTED FOR FEASIBILITY OF FABRICATING A SENSOR MODULE WITH HOLLOW, METAL-COATED MICROPILLAR STRUCTURES. PHASE II WILL ALLOW FOR CHARACTERIZATION AND REFINEMENT OF THE ENZYME SYSTEM WITH SMALL ANIMAL STUDIES. ISSUES SUCH AS ENZYME STABILITY, MEMBRANE EXCLUSION PROPERTIES, BONDING, BIOCOMPATIBILITY, RESPONSE TIME, AND LINEARITY WILL BE CHARACTERIZED IN IN VITRO AND IN VIVO MODELS. THIS SENSOR WILL PROVIDE MORE THAN 2 MILLION INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETICS WITH THE FINE DYNAMIC CONTROL REQUIRED WHEN USING AN ARTIFICIAL BETA CELL. IN ADDITION, BASIC TISSUE INTERACTION WITH ITS IMPLANTATION AND CONTROL OF THE SOFT TISSUE BIOLOGIC INTERFACE CAN BE DIRECTLY APPLIED TO A BROAD RANGE OF IMPLANTS AND THEIR DESIGN.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE THERMAL-BARRIER CONCEPT FOR TANDEM MAGNETIC MIRRORS HAS GREATLY INHANCED THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF THIS APPROACH TO CONFINING HIGH-TEMPERATURE PLASMAS FOR FUSION POWER. TRANSIENT EXISTENCE OF THERMAL BARRIERS HAS ALREADY BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN THE TMX EXPERIMENT AT LIVERMORE AND IN THE GAMMA 10 EXPERIMENT IN JAPAN, USING ELECTRON CYCLOTRON HEATING (ECH) TECHNIQUES. IF THE THERMAL BARRIER ELECTROSTATIC POTENTIAL WELL IS TO BE MAINTAINED FOR SIGNIFICANT PERIODS OF TIME IN COLLISIONALLYEQUILIBRATED PLASMAS, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE, ECONOMICAL TECHNIQUES FOR PREVENTING THE ACCUMULATION OF POSITIVELY-CHARGED IONS IN THE POTENTIAL WELL. THAT IS, ELECTROSTATICALLY-TRAPPED IONS THAT HAVE DIFFUSED INTO THE WELL FROM THE CENTRAL CELL MUST BE PUMPED OUT OF THE WELL. NO ENTIRELY SATISFACTORY CONCEPT FOR ACCOMPLISHING THIS PUMPING HAS YET BEEN DEVELOPED, ALTHOUGH IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT RF ELECTRIC FIELDS PARALLEL TO THE CONFINING MAGNETIC FIELD COULD BE USEFUL FOR THIS PURPOSE IF THEIR SPACE AND TIME DEPENDENCES COULD BE SYNCHRONOUS WITH THE BALLISTIC MOTION OF THE MARGINALLY-TRAPPED IONS. HERE WE PROPOSE A NOVEL CONCEPT FOR CREATING SUITABLE ELECTRIC FIELDS DEEP IN THE INTERIOR OF THE THERMAL BARRIER PLASMA BY MODULATING THEFREQUENCY OF THE FUNDAMENTAL-RESONANCE ECH POWER. THE CONCEPT IS BASED ON THE WELL-KNOWN ACCUMULATION OF THE TURNING POINTS OF MILDLY-RELATIVISTIC ELECTRONS ABOUT THE RESONANT SURFACE WHERE THEIR GYROFREQUENCY MATCHES THE FREQUENCY OF ECH MICROWAVE POWER. THESE ELECTRONS, WHOSE ENERGIES ARE TYPICALLY SOME TENS OF KEV, ARE CONFINED WITHINA CYLINDER TERMINATED BY THE (SYMMETRIC) RESONANT SURFACES. THEIR DENSITY CAN APPARENTLY BE VARIED BY MODULATING THE ECHFREQUENCY. WE WILL SEEK TO ESTABLISH THE DYNAMICAL LIMITS ON THIS CONCEPT AND, IN PARTICULAR, ADAPT IT TO PROVIDE THE DESIRED SYNCHRONISM WITH TRAPPED IONS. A DEMONSTRATION OF THE CONCEPT WILL BE PLANNED FOR PHASE II.",

THIS DATA WILL BE USED TO SUPPLEMENT PRESENTLY OBTAINED PHOTOGRAPHIC INFORMATION. SENSOR REQUIREMENTS ARE OUTLINED IN DETAIL AND APPLICABILITY OF EXISTING INSTRUMENTATION PACKAGES IS DISCUSSED. ALL PROPOSED SENSORS ARE STATE-OF-THE-ART, READILY AVAILABLE, AND HAVE A LONG SUCCESSFUL HISTORY OF UTILIZATION IN BOTH HUMAN BIODYNAMIC RESPONSE RESEARCH AND ESCAPE SYSTEM AND CRASH WORTHY SEAT TESTING. AS IS THE CASE FOR THE SENSORS, THE PROPOSED DATA ACQUISITION AND STORAGE SYSTEM POSES NO RISK WHILE PROVIDING FORMIDABLE PERFORMANCE. PROTOTYPES OF THE DATA ACQUISITION AND STORAGE SYSTEM HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE ROBUST AND CAPABLE OF WITHSTANDING SHOCK LOADS UP TO 40G WITH 1700G/SEC ONSET RATES. THE SYSTEM HAS SUBSEQUENTLY INCORPORATED HYBRID CHIP TECHNOLOGY, PROVIDING ADDITIONAL HARDENING AND MINIATURIZATION. THE VARIABLE CUT-OFF FREQUENCY CAPABILITY, COUPLED TO THE RANGE OF PROGRAMMABLE GAIN, MAKES IT COMPATIBLE WITH VIRTUALLY ANY SENSOR CONFIGURATION. CONSEQUENTLY, APPLICATION OF THIS TECHNOLOGY TO THE BLAST ENVIRONMENT POSES A LOW RISK, HIGH PAYOFF SUPPLEMENT TO THE EXISTING DATA ACQUISITION TECHNIQUES.",

COUPLED NUCLEAR EFFECTS MAY ALSO COME FROM EXPLOSIVE DEVICES, MISSILES, OR FROM CONTAMINATION THAT HAS BEEN INFILTRATED INTO OUR COUNTRY FOR SELECTIVE APPLICATIONS. DEFENSE PREPARATION OF COUNTERMEASURES REQUIRED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND IDENTIFICATION OF NEUTRALIZATION TECHNIQUES ESSENTIAL TO THE SURVIVING OF COUPLED OFFENSIVE DEW/NUCLEAR SYSTEMS. PRIME TARGETS FOR SELECTIVE APPLICATION OF DEWS ARE HUMANS. IMMOBILIZATION OF SELECTED INDIVIDUALS, DISORIENTATION, OR DECISION REVERSAL DURING HIGHLY STRESSED SITUATIONS IS AN EFFECTIVE APPLICATION OF DEWS THAT HAS RECEIVED LITTLE ATTENTION. THIS PROJECT PROPOSES SPECIFIC METHODS OF IDENTIFICATION, NEUTRALIZATION, AND COUNTERMEASURES FOR COUPLED DEW/NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

THE AUDIOVISUAL ELEMENT OF THE CIVD PACKAGES WILL BE SUPPLEMENTED BY APPROPRIATE WRITTEN MATERIAL IN BOOKLET FORM, WHICH WILL EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANT MEDICAL INFORMATION PERTAINING TO TM AND WILL ALSOOFFER SHORT SELF-ASSESSMENT TESTS. THE ULTIMATE AIM OF THE PHASE I PILOT SERIES WILL BE TO TEST THE TEACHING EFFECTIVE-NESS OF CIVD MODULES AND TO ESTABLISH AN APPROPRIATE PRODUCTION AND MARKETING SCHEDULE FOR A COMPLETE SERIES OF 10 TO 12 CIVD MODULES, TO BE PRODUCED IN PHASE II. THE LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES OF THE COMPLETE SERIES WILL BE TO EDUCATE NURSING STUDENTS, MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY STUDENTS, MEDICAL STUDENTS, RESIDENTS, AND FELLOWS REGARDING THE FOLLOWING: APPROPRIATE ASPECTS OF BLOOD DISEASES AND BLOOD RESOURCES; THE USE OF CURRENT TECHNOLOGY AND PROCEDURES TO ELIMINATE THE HAZARDS OF BLOOD TRANSFUSION; AND THE IMPROVE-MENT OF BLOOD MANAGEMENT AND BLOOD ORDERING HABITS FOR MORE EFFECTIVE USE OF BLOOD PRODUCTS. THROUGH CIVD, ALL OF THESEOBJECTIVES WILL BE ADDRESSED WHILE MAINTAINING A PATIENT- ORIENTED APPROACH.",

COMPUTER PROGRAMS WOULD BE DEVELOPED TO ACQUIRE AND STORE THE POSITION DATA. THE SCANNING SYSTEM, INCLUDING THE LIGHT SOURCE AND RECEIVING PHTO DETECTOR WOULD BE LOCATED SEVERAL FEET FROM THE MODEL, OUTSIDE OF THE MACH 6 WIND TUNNEL. IT WILL OPERATE BY PASSING THE LIGHT THROUGH A WINDOW IN THE TUNNEL WALL. THUS THE HIGH INTERNAL TEMPERATURE IS NOT A PROBLEM. FOR PROBE AND MODEL SURFACES WHICH ARE DIFFUSE REFLECTING SURFACES, IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO ALIGN THE LASER BEAM NORMAL TO THE SURFACES BUT ONLY KNOW THE INCIDENCE ANGLE, SINCE THE SYSTEM USES A RANGE FINDING TECHNIQUE. A MINOR CORRECTION TO THE SPEED OF LIGHT DUE TO THE TEMPERATURE AND DENSITY OVER THE REGION BETWEEN THE PROBE AND THE MODEL MAY BE REQUIRED. THE SENSITIVITY OF THIS CORRECTION WILL BE INVESTIGATED.

        "abstract": "Abstract         IN THE DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS WASTES, ATTENTION MUST BE DIRECTED NOT ONLY TO THE PROBLEMS OF SAFE COLLECTION, TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE, BUT ALSO TO THE PROBLEM OF ISOLATING THE HAZARDOUS MATERIAL FOR A LONG TIME. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR RADIOACTIVE WASTES, WHICH NEED TO BE ISOLATED FOR MANY THOUSANDS OF YEARS. UNDERGROUND DISPOSAL IS AN OPTION THAT SHOW CONSIDERABLE PROMISE IF ASSURANCES CAN BE MADE TO ITS LONG-TERM SAFETY. A MAJOR CRITERION IN IDENTIFYING A SUITABLE SITE IS FOR THERE TO BE LITTLE WATER CIRCULATION TO PREVENT WIDESPREAD AND RAPID DISPERSAL IF THE STORAGE CONTAINERS ARE BREACHED. LOW CIRCULATION MAY BE ASSURED IF THE GROUNDWATER IS VERY OLD. THERE ARE MANY METHODS OF ESTIMATING GROUNDWATER AGES, BUT ATMOSPHERIC RADIONUCLIDES ARE, PERHAPS, THE MOST DIRECT AN MOST ACCURATE. TANDEM ACCELERATOR MASS SPECTROMETRY HAS RECENTLY MADE 36C1 (3.1X105 YR.) AVAILABLE AS A WATER DATINGTECHNIQUE. ANOTHER RADIONUCLIDE, 81KR (2.1X105 YR.), SHOWS GREAT PROMISE AS A WATER DATING METHOD AND HYDROLOGICAL TRACER. 81KR WILL COMPLEMENT INFORMATION GAINED FROM 36C1 AND OTHER DATING TECHNIQUES, AND BECAUSE OF THE CHEMICAL INERTNESS OF KRYPTON, MAY SIMPLIFY INTERPRETATION OF THE RESULTS. 81KR CANNOT BE MEASURED WITH TAMS. RESONANCE IONIZATION SPECTROSCOPY (RIS) INVOLVES THE STEPWISE EXCITATION, IONIZATION, AND COUNTING OF ATOMS OF A PRE-SELECTED ELEMENT. BECAUSE NARROW-BAND LASERS ARE USED, SUFFICIENT OPTICAL POWER ENABLES ALL OF THE ATOMS OF THE SELECTED ELEMENT TO BE IONIZED, WHILE THE INTERFERENCE FROM OTHER ELEMENTS REMAINS NEGLIGIBLE. THE IONS FORMED ARE EXTRACTED AND PASSED THROUGH A MASS SPECTROMETER, THEREBY ACHIEVING ISOTOPIC SELECTIVITY. BECAUSE OF THE VERY HIGH ISOTOPE RATIOS IN 81KR COUNTING, SEVERAL ENRICHMENT STEPS ARE REQUIRED BEFORE COUNTING BY RIS. IT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROGRAM TO DEVELOP 81KR COUNTING TO ENABLE ROUTINE MEASUREMENTS OF THIS IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL TRACER. PHASE I WILL CHARACTERIZE EXISTING ENRICHMENT PROCEDURES AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTICAL ENRICHMENT SYSTEMS. AS A TEST, THE 81KR CONTENT OF ATMOSPHERIC KRYPTON WILL BE MEASURED. PHASE II WILL DEVELOP THE ENRICHMENT SYSTEM AND TAILOR THE RIS ATOM COUNTING SYSTEM TO 81KR. MEASUREMENTS WILL BE MADE OF WELL CHARACTERIZED HYDROLOGICAL SAMPLES FOR COMPARISON.",

IN SEMICONDUCTOR RESEARCH, FOR INSTANCE, THERE IS A NEED FOR ULTRA-TRACE ELEMENT ANALYSIS IN SOLIDS BELOW THE PPBA LEVEL WITH SPATICAL RESOLUTION IN THE FEW MICRON RANGE. RESONANCE IONIZATION SPECTROSCOPY (RIS) INVOLVES THE STEPWISE EXCITATION, IONIZATION, AND COUNTING OF ATOMS OF A PRE-SELECTED ELEMENT, GENERALLY IN A LARGE BACKGROUND OF OTHER ELEMENTS. NARROWBAND LASERS ALLOW SUFFICIENT OPTICAL POWER TO IONIZE MOST ATOMS OF THE SELECTED ELEMENT WITH NEGLIGIBLE IONIZATION OF THE OTHER ELEMENTS.IN RIS, THE SENSITIVITY DEPENDS ON THE NUMBER OF ATOMS THAT ARE IN THE LASER BEAM. LASER ABLATION CAN PROVIDE ATOM DENSITIES AS HIGH AS 10 TO THE 20TH POWER CM-3 WITH RESOLUTION OF A FEW MICRONS. AT >10 TO THE 7TH POWER W CM-2, PLASMAS ARE FORMED, WITH HIGH ENERGY IONS DEGRADING MASS DISCRIMINATION. BECAUSE OF THE HIGH ION YIELD, MOST WORKERS ATTEMPT TO OPERATE CLOSE TO THIS THRESHOLD. WITH RIS, LASER ABLATION NEED ONLY VAPORIZED, PERMITTING POWER DENSITIES OF  TO THE 7TH POWER W CM-2, AT WHICH MOSTLY NEUTRALS ARE FORMED. WE PROPOSE INVESTIGATING QUANTIFICATION OF LASER ABLATION TO DETERMINE IF COMBINED WITH RIS, UNPRECEDENTED SENSITIVITY IN MATERIAL ANALYSIS BECOMES POSSIBLE.",

WE ARE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED WITH THE INTERFACES BETWEEN THE VARIOUS SUBSYSTEMS OR ELEMENTS OF THE TOTAL SYSTEM. THE NECESSARY PROPERTIES TO ACHIEVE FAULT TOLERANCE ARE: ALL ERRORS MUST BE DETECTED AND CORRECTED, ALL NOMINALLY INDEPENDENT SYSTEMS MUST BE ISOLATED TO THE EXTENT THAT ERRORS OR OTHER FAULTS IN THEM CANNOT DISTURB THE PERFORMANCE OF THE OTHER ELEMENTS OR SUBSYSTEMS; AND EACH SUBSYSTEM MUST BE ABLE TO DETECT THE STATUS OF OTHER SUBSYSTEMS SO THAT IT MAY DETERMINE IF THAT SUBSYSTEM IS IN A FAULT-FREE STATE, OR IS IN A STATE WHEREBY A FAULT EXISTS BUT HAS BEEN PROPERLY HANDLED, OR IS IN A STATE WHERE A FAULT OR MULTIPLE FAULTS EXIST THAT DISABLE THE PARTICULAR SUBSYSTEM. THE APPROACH USED IS ONE OF HIERARCHICAL ABSTRACTION. AT THE TOP LEVEL OF THE HIERARCHY THE PERFORMANCE GOALS AND RELIABILITY GOALS OF THE TARGET SYSTEM ARE SPECIFIED. AT THE NEXT LEVELS, EACH SUBSYSTEM WILL BE DEFINED IN TERMS OF ITS GOALS AND THE INTERCONNECTION BETWEEN THEM WILL BE EXAMINED. AT EACH SUBSEQUENT SUBLEVEL OF THE HIERARCHY, THE SUBSUBSYSTEM SPECIFICATION AND INTERCONNECTION WILL BE EXAMINED TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS OF THE HIGHER LEVEL SUBSYSTEM.

REGARDLESS OF APPARENT STRENGTH AT A GIVEN TIME, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE WORKED IN AN UPRIGHT POSITION. STIMULATION AND REACTION OF MUSCLES AGAINST THE PULL OF GRAVITY IS A VERY IMPORTANT TOOLWITH WHICH TO WORK. A PATIENT MAY NOT HAVE THE NEURO- MUSCULAR CONTROL TO RESPOND ON COMMAND BUT WHEN EXPOSED TO AN OFF-BALANCED POSITION, THE MUSCLES WILL RESPOND. CONTINUOUS PROPER BODY POSITIONING FOR WEIGHT BEARING, STRETCHING, AND EXPOSURE TO OFF-BALANCE POSITIONS ON PROPER POSITIONING EQUIPMENT, DESIGNED TO GIVE A PATIENT THE ADVANTAGE OF LEVERAGE, LEADS TO PHYSICAL IMPROVEMENT.

IN 1975, ONE PERCENT OF U.S. LIVE BIRTHS DEVELOPED RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (RDS), OF WHICH 6,000 TO 8,000 DEATHS WEREDIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO PREMATURITY. ADDITIONALLY, 75 PERCENT OF ALL PERINATAL DEATHS ARE IN PREMATURE INFANTS. PREMATURITY IS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH MORBIDITY, EMOTIONAL ANXIETY, AND INTENSIVE MEDICAL CARE, RESULTING IN SPIRALING HEALTH CARE COSTS. A MEANS OF EXTENDING AT-RISK PREGNANCIESWOULD REDUCE HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURES WHILE IMPROVING THE MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY STATISTICS. THE PROPOSED GOAL IS ANAUAM THAT CONSISTS OF A MONITORING CONSOLE AND AN AMBULATORYMONITOR (AM). THE FOCUS OF PHASE I IS TO ESTABLISH THE TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY OF CRITICAL ELEMENTS OF THE AM. A TOCODYNAMOMETER (TOCO) WILL BE DEVELOPED UTILIZING THE UNIQUE PROPERTIES OF A CARBON-DOPED, SEMICONDUCTIVE ELASTOMER AS A UTERINE ACTIVITY SENSOR (UAS). THE TRANS- DUCING PROPERTIES OF THE UAS WILL BE EVALUATED IN A CONTROLLED OFFICE AND/OR HOSPITAL SETTING. THE ELASTOMERIC TOCO WILL THEN BE MODIFIED FOR RELIABLE 24-HOUR AMBULATORY MONITORING IN THE HOME ENVIRONMENT. SOFTWARE ALGORITHMS WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR THE EFFICACIOUS IDENTIFICATION AND DOCUMENTATION OF UTERINE CONTRACTIONS SENSED BY THE ELASTO- MERIC TOCO. A SUCCESSFUL AUAM WILL EXTEND PREGNANCIES, RESULTING IN LONGER-TERM, HEALTHIER NEWBORNS.",

SPECIFIC AIMS FOR PHASE I INVOLVE: (1) DETERMINATION OF THE TIME COURSE AND DOSE RESPONSE OF DNA UPTAKE IN ORDER TO STANDARD-IZE THE OPTIMAL CONDITIONS OF UPTAKE. THIS WILL BE ACHIEVEDUSING A SENSITIVE ELISA TECHNIQUE THAT ASSAYS FOR BUDR- LABELLED DNA. (2) DETERMINATION OF TRANSFORMATION FREQUEN- CIES INDUCED BY PLASMID DNAS CONTAINING HUMAN HRAS OR V-MYC GENES. CONCLUSIVE RESULTS ON THE BEST TRANSFECTION CONDITIONS (ENHANCEMENT OF DNA UPTAKE BY CELL SURFACE MANIPULATIONS, AND THE EXPRESSION OF ONCOGENE-MEDIATED PHENOTYPE), WILL BE STANDARDIZED. PHASE I RESULTS WILL PROVIDE A STANDARDIZED PROTOCOL FOR FUTURE DNA TRANSFECTION EXPERIMENTS; THESE ARE PLANNED FOR PHASE II USING OTHER CELLTYPES AND ONCOGENES.",

THE DRUG IS BEING USED BY PEOPLE FROM ALL SEGMENTS OF SOCIETY, INCLUDING BLUE-AND WHITE-COLLAR WORKERS, MILITARY PERSONNEL, PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES, AND EVEN SCHOOL CHILDREN. AS A RESULT OF THIS PROBLEM, MANY COMPANIES, INCLUDING THE U.S. MILITARY, ARE BEGINNING TO DEMAND THAT EMPLOYEES SUSPECTED OF DRUG USE UNDERGO DRUG TESTING. A VARIETY OF METHODS IS AVAILABLE FORTHE SPECIFIC AND SENSITIVE DETERMINATION OF COCAINE AND ITS MAJOR METABOLITES IN BIOLOGICAL FLUIDS. MOST OF THE AVAIL- ABLE ASSAYS (I.E., HPLC, GC-MS) REQUIRE EXTENSIVE EQUIPMENT AND TRAINED PERSONNEL AND ARE SLOW IN DETERMINING WHETHER COCAINE HAS BEEN CONSUMED. BIOMETRIC WILL DEVELOP AN ENZYMEIMMUNOASSAY (EIA) THAT WILL BE USEFUL FOR THE DETECTION OF LOW CONCENTRATIONS OF COCAINE IN SALIVA. THIS ASSAY MAY ALSO BE ADAPTABLE FOR THE DETECTION OF OTHER ILLICIT DRUGS. THE ASSAY IS SIMPLE, FAST (LESS THAN 5 MINUTES), NONINSTRU- MENTAL, AND THUS EASILY PORTABLE FOR USE IN THE WORK PLACE.",

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PHASE I PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP A MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY TO ARTEMISININ. THE ANTIBODY WILL THEN BE USED TO SELECT PLANTS WHICH ARE HIGH YIELDERS OF ARTEMISININ. THIS SELECTION WILL LEAD TO PHASE II CULTIVATION INITIALLY USING PLANT TISSUE CULTURE OF THESE SELECTED \"HIGH YIELDERS.\" THIS HAS IMMEDIATE COMMERCIAL APPLICATION IN THE EFFORTS AGAINST MALARIA IN THAT HIGH- YIELDING PLANTS MAY BE PROPAGATED TO PROVIDE A SOURCE OF ARTEMISININ LARGE ENOUGH FOR USE AS A DRUG. THE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY COULD FURTHER BE USED IN BIOAVAILABILITY, PHARMAKINETIC, AND DRUG MONITORING STUDIES.",

IN PHASE II, BIOTRACK WOULD DESIGN AND FABRICATE A PRE-PROTOTYPE SYSTEM THAT WOULD PERFORM IN A CLINICAL SETTING. REFINEMENTS OF THE PROTOTYPE WOULD LEAD TO THE FIRST OF SEVERAL COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS FOR PATIENT-SIDE IN-VITRO TESTING OF ANALYTES.",

THESE STUDIES CLEARLY HIGHLIGHT THE RELEVANCE OF GROWTH VARIABLES/PARAMETERS IN THE ULTIMATE QUALITY OF RDX CRYSTALS. SOME OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AFFECTING THE SIZE, DENSITY AND DISTRIBUTION OF CAVITIES OF RDX ARE: A. QUALITY OF STARTING/SEED CRYSTAL, B. COOLING RATE DURING CRYSTALLIZATION AND C. PHOTO SENSITIVITY OF RDX. ALL THREE OF THESE FACTORS HAVE BEEN DIRECTLY LINKED TO THE APPEARANCE OF GROWTH CAVITIES IN RDX. IN THE PROPOSED PHASE I PROGRAM A CONCERTED EFFORT WILL BE DIRECTED TOWARDS THE GROWTH OF CAVITY FREE RDX USING SOLUTION RECRYSTALLIZATION. THE THREE MAJOR GROWTH CRITERIA ENUMERATED EARLIER WILL BE THE FOCUS OF ATTENTION. THE STARTING SEED OF RDX WILL BE OBTAINED BY PURIFYING EXISTING RDX USING SOLUTION RECRYSTALLIZATION PROCESS. THESE SEEDS WILL THEN BE USED TO GROW LARGE, CAVITY FREE, SINGLE CRYSTALS OF RDX IN THE ABSENCE OF LIGHT USING EXTREMELY SLOW COOLING RATES. THE CONTROLLED COOLING REQUIRED WILL BE ACHIEVED USING AUTOMATED PROGRAMMABLE THERMAL SYSTEMS. THESE HIGH QUALITY RDX CRYSTALS WILL THEN BE FRAGMENTED TO THE APPROPRIATE GRAIN SIZE AND DISTRIBUTION BY THERMAL SHOCKING TECHNIQUES. PHASE II WILL EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF UTILIZING THESE TECHNIQUES IN PRODUCTION ORIENTED ENVIRONMENTS. THE CONTROLLED INTRODUCTION OF CAVITIES IN RDX BY ULTRASONIC, UV, PHOTOLYSIS TECHNIQUES WILL ALSO BE EXPLORED IN GREATER DETAIL. IT WILL THUS BE FEASIBILE TO CONTROL THE SENSITIVITY/ENERGETICS OF THE END PRODUCT BY MAINTAINING STRICK CONTROL OVER THE GROWTH PARAMETERS AND CONDITIONS. THE CAVITIES WILL BE CHARACTERIZED USING SMALL ANGLE X-RAY SCATTERING AND SEM TECHNIQUES.",

MANY TECHNIQUES BOTH DESTRUCTIVE AND NONDESTRUCTIVE HAVE SO FAR BEEN UTILIZED IN AN ATTEMPT TO QUANTIY THE ENERGETIC PROPERTIES OF THEIR COMPOSITES. THESE COMPOSITES MAY CONTAIN ONE OR MORE ENERGETIC CONSTITUENTS IN AN ELASTOMERIC BINDER. NON-DESTRUCTIVE X-RAY CHARACTERIZATION TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY EMPLOYED TO MEASURE SEVERAL MICROSTRUCTURAL PARAMETERS. PREVIOUS STUDIES CONDUCTED AT BRIMROSE AND RUTGERS IN CONJUNCTION WITH NSWC HAVE SHOWN CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCES AMONG VARIOUS PRODUCTION GRADE RDX. THESE STUDIES REVEAL MARKED DIFFERENCES IN THE AMOUNTS OF RESIDUAL ELASTRIC STRAIN AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF DISLOCATIONS (RESIDUAL PLASTIC STRAIN) IN THE CONSTITUENT RDX PHASE. ADDITIONALLY, X-RAY DIFFRACTOMETRY CAN BE USED TO RAPIDLY QUANTIFY THE CONSTITUENT COMPOSITION IN COMPOSITED. THE PROPOSED PHASE I STUDY IS TO ASCERTAIN THE FEASIBILITY OF APPLYING THE NEWLY DEVELOPED BRIMROSE AUTOMATED X-RAY DIFFRATION TECHNIQUES TO PRODUCTION QUALITY CONTROL OF ENERGETIC MATERIALS AND COMPOSITES. THESE METHODS UTILIZE ADVANCE DIGITAL DATA ACQUISITION AND PROCESSING TECHNIQUES.

THE ADMINISTRATION OF FAT-SOLUBLE VITAMINS BECOMES A MEDICAL PROBLEM WHEN DEFICIENCIES IN THESE SUBSTANCES ARE DISPLAYED BY SUBJECTS WITH MALABSORPTION SYNDROME. LIPOSOLUBLE VITAMIN DEFICIENCY IN HUMANS IS MOST OFTEN ENCOUNTERED IN PREMATURE INFANTS AND IN ADULTS OR CHILDREN HAVING ABNORMAL ABSORPTION OF FATS FROM THE INTESTINE. ATTENTION HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON THE ADMINISTRATIONOF A-TOCOPHEROL DUE TO THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PRE- MATURE INFANTS IN THE PAST DECADE. ADMINISTRATION OF VITAMIN E IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO COUNTERBALANCE THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF OXYGEN TO THESE NEWBORNS. OXYGEN IS DIRECTLY BENEFICIAL IN TREATING INFANTSWITH HYALINE MEMBRANE DISEASE BUT HAS A SIDE EFFECT OF SEVERE DAMAGE TO THE RETINA. ADEQUATE LEVELS OF VITAMIN E CAN PREVENT THIS; HOWEVER, ORAL ADMINISTRATION OF VITAMIN E TO THESE INFANTS HAS CAUSED SEVERAL NEONATAL DEATHS. THE CURRENT PRODUCTS FOR SUCH PARENTERAL ADMINISTRATION ARE AQUEOUS EMULSIONS WHICH CONTAIN POLYSORBATES AS THE EMULSIFYING AGENT. IN CONTRAST TO THE CONVENTIONAL USE OF SYNTHETIC EMULSIFYING AGENTS, THIS RESEARCH WILL USE A NATURAL AMPHIPATHIC MOLECULE (PHOSPHOLIPID) TO SOLUBILIZE THOSE SUBSTANCES. THEREFORE, THE RESEARCH WILL FOCUS ON THEPREPARATION OF STABLE MICROEMULSIONS OF LIPOSOLUBLE VITAMIN E TO STUDY BLOOD TRANSPORT AND METABOLISM OF THE MICRO- EMULSIONS IN ANIMALS.

SINCE ORGANISMS KNOWN TO DEGRADE SIMILAR COMPOUNDS ARE WIDESPREAD IN SOIL, IN SITU BIOREMEDIATION IS CONSIDERED A PROMISING APPROACH. THIS PROCESS CONSISTS OF ADDING OXYGEN AND NUTRIENTS TO THE GROUNDWATER TO STIMULATE HYDROCARBON-DEGRADING BACTERIA. CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICAL ASSOCIATES PROPOSES TO INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY OF BIODEGRADATION OF JET FUEL BY CARRYING OUT TWO TYPES OF LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS USING MIXED CULTURE MICROCOSMS DEVELOPED FROM CONTAMINATED AQUIFER SAMPLES. ONE TYPE OF MICROCOSM WILL BE AN AQUEOUS SUSPENSION, IN A SEALED FLASK, WITH BACTERIA, JET FUEL, AND NUTRIENTS. DEGRADATION WILL BE MEASURED BY 20(2) PRODUCTION AND THE COMPONENTS DEGRADED WILL BE DETERMINED USING GAS CHROMATOGRAPH. THE SECOND TYPE OF MICROCOSM WILL BE A FLOWTHROUGH SOIL COLUMN TO SIMULATE THE PROCESSES THAT WOULD OCCUR DURING BIOREMEDIATION OF AN AQUIFIER. LOSS OF PERMEABILITY DUE TO BACTERIAL FOULING, AND DEGRADATION OF JET FUEL IN SOIL WILL BE STUDIED. THE BASIS WILL BE PROVIDED FOR PHASE II EXPERIMENTS TO OPTIMIZE NUTRIENT/OXYGEN DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND TO SCIENTIFICALLY DOCUMENT THE PROCESS IN THE FIELD.",

USE OF SUCH AN ANALYTICAL APPROACH FOR ORGANOHALOGENS, ESPECIALLY ONE THAT IS COMPOUND/ANALYTE SPECIFIC, SENSITIVE AT TRACE LEVELS, AND FULLY ON LINE AND AUTOMATED USING RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE AND EASY-TO-OPERATE INSTRUMENTATION WILL SAVE TIME AND EFFORT AND ENHANCE THE ABILITY TO DETECT THESE COMPOUNDS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SAMPLES. THIS APPROACH WILL USE POSTCOLUMN, ONLINE PHOTOLYSIS OF THE HPLC OR FIA ELUENT TO GENERATE NEW PHOTOLYTIC SPECIES THAT HAVE SPECIFIC ELECTROCHEMICAL DETECTION PROPERTIES. THE GENERATION OF CHLORIDE FROM ORGANOCHLORINE COMPOUNDS, BROMIDE FROM ORGANOBROMINE, OR IODIDE FROM ORGANOIODINE, WILL BE DETECTED AS A FUNCTION OF THE WORKING ELECTRODE SURFACE MATERIAL, OXIDATIVE POTENTIAL, AND DUAL ELECTRODE RESPONSE RATIOS. COMPOUND IDENTIFICATION WOULD BE BASED ON:(1) CHROMATOGRAPHIC RETENTION TIMES AND CAPACITY FACTORS; (2) QUALITATIVE LAMP-ON AND LAMP-OFF RESPONSES OF COMPOUNDS INJECTED; AND (3) DUAL ELECTRODE RESPONSE RATIOS AS A FUNCTION OF WORKING ELECTRODE MATERIALS AND POTENTIALS APPLIED.

STANDARD, LOGICAL DISPLAY LAYOUTS AND DATA PRESENTATION FORMATS, EFFICIENT QUERY TECHNIQUES, AND BRIEF, BUT LUCID, EXPLANATIONS OF ANY CONCLUSIONS DRAWN BY THE COMPUTER ARE ALL NECESSARY ELEMENTS OF AN EFFECTIVE MAN/MACHINE INTERFACE FOR AN AI SYSTEM. THESE REQUIREMENTS WILL IMPOSE ADDITIONAL BURDENS ON DESIGNERS TO STRUCTURE THE VISIBLE ELEMENTS OF THE SYSTEM (I.E., THE MAN/MACHINE INTERFACE) TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH HUMAN CAPABILITIES AND EXPECTATIONS. THE PROPOSED EFFORT WILL EMPLOY A COMBINATION OF ANALYTICAL AND EMPIRICAL TECHNIQUES TO DEVELOP AND VALIDATE A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF GUIDELINES FOR DESIGNING MAN/MACHINE INTERFACES FOR AI SIGNAL PROCESSING AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. THE FINAL PRODUCTION OF THIS PROJECT WILL BE A DESIGN SPECIFICATION FOR THE MAN/MACHINE INTERFACE OF A REPRESENTATIVE AI SIGNAL PROCESSING AND INFORMATION MANAGMENT SYSTEM.",

THIS RESEARCH WILL AFFORD SUCH A TREATMENT. IT IS BASED ON THE PATENTED CHEMFIX PROCESS AND UTILIZES AND EXPANDS UPON THE CHEMISTRY INTRINSIC TO THE PROCESS. THE FIXATION OF PEARSON SOFT ACIDS, SUCH AS MERCURY, CADMIUM, ARSENIC, LEAD, AND SILVER, IS NOT ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL WITH THE EXIST- ING CHEMFIX PROCESS, BUT WITH THE ADDITION OF SELECTED ORGANOSULFIDES AND ORGANOAMINES, THESE METALS ARE ALSO IMMOBILIZED. IN ADDITION, THE CHEMFIX-TREATED SLUDGE HAS THE IDEAL ENVIRONMENT FOR REDUCING AGENTS TO DECHLORINATE PESTICIDES AND POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS INTO BIODEGRADABLE ORGANICS. A FEW POTENTIAL REDUCING AGENTS ARE HYDROGEN, AMMONIA, SULFIDE, SULFITE, AND HYDRIDE. WITH THESEADDITIVES, THE TREATMENT OF HAZARDOUS WASTES BY THE CHEMFIX PROCESS CAN BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE CERTAIN WASTES HERETOFORENOT EFFECTIVELY INACTIVATED. DEPENDING UPON THE PROPERTIES OF THESE WASTES, THE CHEMFIX-TREATED HAZARDOUS WASTE MAY BE RE-USEABLE AS AGRICULTURAL LIME AND FERTILIZING SOIL AMENDERS.

THE APPROACH WILL BE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE VERY HIGH SPECIFICITY THAT TISSUE PLASMINOGEN ACTIVATOR (T-PA) HAS FOR FIBRIN, A MAJOR COMPONENT OF CLOTS. WHEN T-PA IS INTRODUCED INTO THE CIRCULATION, IT LOCALIZES AT THECLOT. IF THAT T-PA MOLECULE HAS BEEN LABELED WITH A RADIO- CHEMICAL, THEN IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO DETECT THE PRESENCE OFTHE CLOT AND TO IMAGE IT. IN PHASE I, THIS CONCEPT WILL BE TESTED BY PREPARING LABELED T-PA AND CONFIRMING THAT IT RETAINS ITS FIBRIN-BINDING PROPERTIES. NEXT, THE LABELED T-PA WILL BE INJECTED INTO ANIMALS WITH CLOTS IN THE JUGULARVEIN. THE TISSUE DISTRIBUTION OF THE T-PA WILL THEN BE DETERMINED. FINALLY, THE EFFECT OF INACTIVATING THE ENZYME,REMOVING THE CARBOHYDRATE, AND FRAGMENTATION OF T-PA ON ITS BINDING TO FIBRIN WILL BE DETERMINED.

INTEGRATION OF THIS APPROACH WITH MODIFIED EXISTING PROTOCOLS FOR CRYPPRESERVATION IS ANTICIPATED. THEAPPARATUS WILL APPLY HYDROSTATIC PRESSURES ON THE ORDER OF 6300 ATMOSPHERES IN INTERVALS AS SHORT AS 0.1 SECOND AS WELLAS INDEFINITELY LONGER PERIODS, AND MAINTAIN SUCH PRESSURES AS LONG AS DESIRED. TEMPERATURES WILL BE CONTROLLED INDEPENDENTLY AND WILL RANGE TO BELOW -150 C. THE CHAMBER WILL ACCOMODATE A SAMPLE OF ABOUT 2 CM DIAMETER AND 8 CM LENGTH. PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS WILL BE CARRIED OUT TO FULLY CHARACTERIZE THE OPERATING RANGE AND TO ESTABLISH THE NECESSITY FOR ANY MODIFICATIONS OF A FINAL COMMERCIAL MODEL.SEVERAL TISSUE SAMPLES WILL BE PROCESSED USING RELATIVELY SIMPLE PROTOCOLS. THESE SAMPLES WILL BE EXAMINED FOR EVIDENCE OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ULTRAHIGH PRESSURE TECHNIQUE.",

THE DEVELOPMENT OF A DIPSTICK DOTELISA FOR L. INTERROGANS WILL REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OVER EXISTING CULTURE METHODS AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTS WHICH ARE TEDIOUS, TIME-CONSUMING, AND EXPENSIVE. THIS RAPID, VISUALLY READ TEST REQUIRES MINIMAL TECHNICAL SKILL, NO LABORATORY EQUIPMENT, AND IS COSTEFFECTIVE; THE REACTED DIPSTICK MAY BE KEPT AS A PERMANENT RECORD.

TODAY'S TECHNOLOGY CAN PROVIDE MOBILE ROBOTS WITH ONLY A SHADOW OF THESE CAPACITIES. BEFORE BEGINNING TO STUDY THE BASIC STRUCTURES OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, SENSORY INTEGRATION, AND CONTROL IT IS ESSENTIAL TO FIRST STRIP AWAY ALL UNNECESSARY ENCUMBERMENTS POSED BY THE VEHICLE AND ITS SUPPORT SYSTEM. AT THIS POINT, A LARGE NUMBER OF MOBILE ROBOT RESEARCH PROJECTS HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN, AND A WEALTH OF PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE IS SPREAD AMONG THESE GROUPS. CYBERMATION, AS ONE OF THE FIRST MANUFACTURERS OF INDUSTRIAL QUALITY MOBILE ROBOTS, HAS ALSO GAINED SIGNIFICANT INSIGHTS INTO THE REQUIREMENTS FOR SUCH MACHINES. A STUDY IS PROPOSED THAT WILL CANVAS AS MANY EXPERIENCED GROUPS AS POSSIBLE, IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE IDEAL CHARACTERISTICS FOR A RESEARCH VEHICLE.

GENOTOXICITY AND CYTOKINETIC ABNORMALITIES WOULD BE ASSESSED IN VITRO BY LABELING WITH A HALOGENERATED PHRIMIDINE (IDURD) AND THEN USING MULTIPARAMETER FLOW CYTOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF DNA CONTENT AND THE AMOUNT OF IDURD INCORPORATED (DNA REPLICATION PATTERN) VIA A FLUORESCENT TAGGED MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY HIGHLY SPECIFIC FOR IDURD. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP: 1) AN IMMUNOTOXICITY TEST BASED ON SHORT-TERM CULTURE, BLASTOGENEIC RESPONSE TO PHA MITOGEN STIMULATED, PERIPHERAL BLOOD LYMPHOCYTES (ULTIMATELY T-& BCELL SUBSETS); AND 2) A HEPATOTOXICITY TEST USING IN VITRO IDURD LABELING OF FINE NEEDLE ASPIRATION BIOPSIES. PHASE I STUDIES WOULD UTILIZE DOMESTIC CANINES, WHEREAS BOTH CANINE AND HUMAN CLINICAL MATERIAL WOULD BE STUDIED IN PHASE II. THE HIGH TECHNOLOGY TEST(S) TO BE DEVELOPED WOULD BE VERSATILE; HAVE BROAD COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY APPLICATIONS; AND REPRESENT A MAJOR STEP FORWARD ANALYTICALLY FOR TOXICITY TEST DETECTION OF DNA DAMAGE, CELLULAR ABNORMALITIES, AND DISEASES ACQUIRED NATURALLY OR BY EXPOSURE TO BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS.",

CONFORMAL ARRAYS HAVE PROVEN TO BE ATTRACTIVE ALTERNATIVES TO MOUNTING EXTERNAL RADOMES ON, CUTTING HOLES IN OR CHANGING THE SHAPES OF VEHICLES TO ACCOMMODATE AN ANTENNA. THESE ARRAYS ARE ESPECILLY ATTRACTIVE FOR APPLICATIONS WHICH REQUIRE WIDE ANGULAR COVERAGE WHILE MINIMIZING SCAN LOSS. HOWEVER, NON-PLANAR ARRAYS HAVE SOME UNIQUE FEATURES WHICH MUST BE RECOGNIZED. NOT THE LEAST OF THESE IS THAT CONFORMAL ARRAYS ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO DESIGN AND TO ANALYZE THAN ARE PLANAR ARRAYS. FURTHERMORE, COMPLEXITY IS ADDED WHEN SURFACE IS CONICAL, AS ON A REENTRY VEHICLE. THE TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH ARE TO FORMULATE AND VERIFY EXPRESSIONS FOR CHARACTERIZING THE RESPONSE OF CONICALLY CONFORMAL ARRAYS. TO DO THIS, DSA WILL MAKE USE OF EXISTING INNOVATIVE COMPUTER MODELS AND MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES. THE INTENDED RESULT IS TO ADD TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF CONFORMAL ARRAY PERFORMANCE AND TO DEVELOP TOOLS AND A DATA BASE FOR FUTURE ANALYSES.",

BY COMBINING AN ENZYME-LINKED ASSAY SYSTEM WITH CELL MEMBRANE FRAGMENTS IMMOBILIZED ON A GLASS MICROFIBER SUBSTRATE, ANTIBODIES IN 0.5 MICROLITER SAMPLES OF HUMAN SERUM CAN BE IDENTIFIED IN ABOUT 10 MINUTES, WITH UP TO 96 TESTS BEING PERFORMED SIMULTANEOUSLY. IN ADDITION,THE IMMOBILIZED ANTIGEN SHOWS NO NOTICEABLE LOSS OF SENSITIVITY FOR AT LEAST 6 MONTHS WHEN STORED AT ROOM TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY. THIS STABILITY IS SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN THE THREE WEEK SHELF-LIFE OF REFRIGERATED CELL PANELS ROUTINELY USED. TAKEN TOGETHER, OUR INITIAL WORK STRONGLY SUGGESTS THAT THIS NONAGGLUTINATION METHOD WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT PRACTICAL ADVANCE OVER TECHNIQUES NOW USED FORPRETRANSFUSION TESTING. ONCE REFINED, THIS SYSTEM MAY BE USED TO DETECT OTHER CLINICALLY RELEVANT ANTIBODIES SUCH AS THOSE TO HEPATITIS VIRUS ANTIGENS AND HTLV-III.",

THIS PROPOSAL DEALS WITH ASPECTS OF THE DESIGN OF AN EXPERT CAD SYSTEM TO AID A DESIGNER IN CREATING A TESTABLE CHIP, AND ALSO IN CREATING THE TEST PROGRAM ITSELF. THE WORK WILL EXTEND RESEARCH WE HAVE ALREADY CARRIED OUT ON THIS PROBLEM. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM IS CAPABLE OF MODELING EXISTING TEST TECHNIQUES AS A.I. FRAMES, AND OF AUTOMATICALLY EMBEDDING THESE TECHNIQUES INTO A CHIP BEING DESIGNED. NEW TEST TECHNIQUES, AS THEY ARE INVENTED BY TEST EXPERTS, CAN BE EASILY ADDED TO THE SYSTEM BY TEST EXPERTS. THE PROPOSED WORK DEALS WITH 4 KEY TASKS: (1) DEFINING A SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE FOR SUCH AN EXPERT SYSTEM, (2) DETERMINIG A SET OF BIT STRUCTURES AND THEIR CHARACTERISTICS USEFUL FOR GATE ARRAY CIRCUITS; (3) DETERMINING WAYS TO CALCULATE VALUES FOR MEASURES FOR TEST TECHNIQUES SO THAT AN INTELLIGENT SELECTION BETWEEN TECHNIQUES CAN BE MADE; AND (4) DEVELOPING WAYS TO PARTITION A CIRCUIT SO THAT EACH PARTITION CAN BE MADE TESTABLE.",

THIS REACTIVITY COULD BE VERY DETRIMENTAL TO THE FUNCTIONING OF THE LITHIUM BATTERY IF RESISTIVE FILMS FORM OR IF GOOD INTERFACIAL CONTACT IS LOST BETWEEN THE LITHIUM AND THE POLYMER ELECTROLYTE. WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE REACTIONS AT THE LITHIUM/POLYMER ELECTROLYTE INTERFACE USING SURFACE ENHANCED RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY (SERS). THIS TECHNIQUE WILL ALLOW THE MONITORING OF THE VIBRATIONAL SPECTRUM OF SPECIES ON THE LITHIUM ELECTRODE SURFACE WHILE THE ELECTRODE REMAINS IN AN ELECTROCHEMICAL CELL, I.E., IN SITU.

THE TECHNIQUE IS SIMILAR TO THE ELISA METHODOLOGY IN THAT ENZYME-LABELED DERIVATIVES OF ANTIGENS AND ANTIBODIES ARE USED TO DETECT IMMUNE COMPLEXES. IT DIFFERS FROM MOST ELISA METHODS IN THAT IT USES AN ACTIVATOROF COAGULATION (RUSSELL'S VIPER VENOM FACTOR X ACTIVATOR OR RVV-XA) AS THE LABELING ENZYME AND A UNIQUE CLOTTING ASSAY, ENTITLED ENZYME-LINKED COAGULATION ASSAY (ELCA), AS THE DETECTION SYSTEM. ELCA USES PEROXIDASE-LABELED FIBRINOGEN IN SOLUTION AND UNLABELED FIBRINOGEN TOGETHER AS A SUBSTRATEFOR THROMBIN, WHICH IS GENERATED IN THE CLOTTING CASCADE. THROMBIN CLEAVES BOTH FORMS TO FIBRIN AND CONSEQUENTLY PEROXIDASE-FIBRIN IS BOUND TO THE SOLID PHASE. USED AS A DETECTION SYSTEM FOR RVV-XA, THIS ASSAY CAN MEASURE AS LITTLE AS 50 FEMTOGRAMS/ML OF RVV-XA, WHICH IS MORE THAN THREE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE LOWER THAN THE DETECTION LIMIT FORPEROXIDASE. ANTIGENS AND ANTIBODIES CAN BE LABELED WITH THIS ENZYME; THESE CONJUGATES CAN THEN BE USED FOR COMPET- ITIVE IMMUNOASSAYS WITH HIGH SENSITIVITY. BY COMBINATION OFTHE SPECIFICITY OF MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES FOR FACTORS OF INTEREST (II,VII,IX,X,AND PROTEIN C) WITH THIS SENSITIVE DETECTION SYSTEM, RESEARCHERS WILL ASSAY THREE IMPORTANT PARAMETERS OF INTEREST IN THROMBOSIS AND HEMOSTASIS, THAT IS, ACTIVATED FACTOR X, CLOTTING FACTOR ANTIGEN LEVELS, AND COMPLEXES OF FACTOR XA WITH ANTITHROMBIN III. THESE IMMUNO-ASSAYS, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SENSITIVE FUNCTIONAL DETECT-ION OF CLOTTING FACTORS BY ELCA, WILL PROVIDE A COMPLETE SYSTEM FOR THE DETECTION OF COMPONENTS OF INTEREST IN HEMOSTASIS AND THROMBOSIS.",

STUDIES INDICATE THAT ESPIS A TISSUE AND SERUM MARKER FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF HORMONE- PRODUCING TUMORS. WITH IMMUNOCHEMICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL TECHNIQUES, RESEARCHERS HAVE IDENTIFIED ESP IN NORMAL AND/ORNEOPLASTIC TISSUE OF THE ADRENAL, PITUITARY, PANCREAS, HYPOTHALMUS, THYROID, AND PARATHYROID NEOPLASMS, AS DEMONSTRATED BY RADIOIMMUNOASSAY-INCREASED SERUM CONCENTRATIONS OF ESP IN PATIENTS WITH TUMORS OF THESE ENDOCRINE GLANDS. SIMILAR OBSERVATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE IN PATIENTS WITH HORMONE-PRODUCING TUMORS OF NONENDOCRINE TISSUE, SUCH AS CARCINOMA OF THE LUNG AND GI TRACT. THE RESEARCH RADIOIMMUNOASSAY PROCEDURE DEVELOPED FOR ESP WILL BE USED AS THE BASIS FOR A KIT FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF THIS PROTEIN.

THESE DELETERIOUS EFFECTS OF IL-1 COULD BE COUNTERACTED BY SPECIFIC HUMAN MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES TO IL-1. THIS PROJECT PROPOSES TO DEVELOP NEUTRALIZING HUMAN MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIESTO HUMAN IL-1 THAT MAY BE USEFUL IN THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS SUCH AS LUPUS, RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, AND OTHER INFLAMMATORY DISEASES MEDIATED IN PART BY THIS MONOKINE. IN PHASE I, HUMAN MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES TO IL-1 WILL BE GENERATED BY FUSIONS OF SENSITIZED HUMAN B- CELLS SECRETING IL-1 ANTIBODIES FROM A GROUP OF LUPUS PATIENTS SHOWN TO POSSESS SUCH AUTOANTIBODIES TO IL-1. THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS PROJECT IS BASED ON (1) THE AVAILABILITYTO THE ASSEMBLED TEAM OF LARGE QUANTITIES OF RECOMBINANT ANDMONOCYTE-DERIVED IL-1; (2) AN EXISTING SENSITIVE ELISA WHICHDETECTS HUMAN IL-1 ANTIBODIES; (3) THE OBSERVATION THAT SOMEPATIENTS WITH SLE HAVE HIGH TITERS OF SUCH ANTIBODIES; AND (4) EXPERIENCE WITH THE GENERATION OF HUMAN HYBRIDOMAS THAT PRODUCE ANTICYTOKINE ANTIBODIES. THE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AND IMMUNO-SUPPRESSIVE EFFECTS OF NEUTRALIZING HUMAN MONOCLONAL IL-1 ANTIBODIES WILL BE EVALUATED IN A SERIES OF FUNCTIONAL IN VITRO ASSAYS IN PREPARATION FOR CLINICAL TRIALS IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASES.",

IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE THERAPEUTIC URICASE WILL BE ABLE TO COMPLETELY REMOVE URATE DEPOSITS IN THE BODY. IT WILL ALSO CONTROL HYPERURICEMIA IFGIVEN AT INTERVALS IN SMALL AMOUNTS. THERAPEUTIC URICASE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DISSOLVE URATE DEPOSITS IN A MATTER OF HOURS OR DAYS, AND SHOULD PROVIDE IMMEDIATE RELIEF FOR ACUTEGOUTY ARTHRITIS ATTACKS, WITH NO LIKELIHOOD OF RECURRENCE. CANCER PATIENTS UNDERGOING AGGRESSIVE RADIATION OR CHEMO- THERAPY AGAINST LARGE TUMOR MASSES WILL BE PROTECTED FROM EXCESSIVE URATE PRODUCTION. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THIS PROJECT ARE TO MODIFY BY COVALENT ATTACHMENT OF MONOMETHOXY-POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL (PEG) A SELECTED URICASE WITH HIGH ACTIVITY, GOOD STABILITY, AND CONTROLLED IMMUNOGENICITY. PROCEDURES FOR DEVELOPING A HOMOGENEOUS PEG-URICASE ARE PROCEEDING. ANIMAL TOXICOLOGY STUDIES WILL BE DONE IN MICE,RATS, AND DOGS.",

THE LAYERS ARE GROWN BY A NEW VAPOR-PHASE METHOD WHICH YIELDS COMPOSITIONS COVERING THE ENTIRE ALLOY RANGE BETWEEN HGTE AND CDTE. INDEPENDENT CONTROL OF THE FOUR PRINCIPAL PARAMETERS THAT DETERMINE THE COMPOSITION; THE SUBSTRATE TEMPERATURE AND THE PARTIAL PRESSURES OF HG, CD AND TE IS ACHIEVED IN AN OPEN-TUBE SYSTEM THAT UTILIZES SEPARATE ELEMENTAL SOURCES. THE GROWTH OF DEVICE QUALITY EPILAYERS INCLUDING LAYERS SUITABLE FOR RESONANT OPTICAL CAVITY (ROC) APPLICATIONS, HAS ALREADY BEEN DEMONSTRATED. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS ARE: 1) THE PROCESS CAN MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF COST EFFECTIVE PRODUCTION AND SAFETY AND 2) THE REACTOR IS OF SIMPLE CONSTRUCTION AND UTILIZES THE ELEMENTS DIRECTLY.

FOCUS RESEARCH HAS DEVELOPED A MODIFICATION OF A SELECTIVE, HIGH-RESOLUTION ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUE FOR THESEPARATION OF SUCH COMPOUNDS, BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF ISOELECTRIC FOCUSING. THE MODIFICATION HAS SEVERAL ADVANTAGES OVER EXISTING TECHNIQUES: (1) IT HAS VERY HIGH CAPACITY AND CAN BE USED IN A CONTINUOUS, FLOW-THROUGH FASHION. (2) IT CAN USE COMMON, INEXPENSIVE BUFFER REAGENTS. (3) IT PRODUCES SHALLOWER PH GRADIENTS, WITH RESULTING HIGHER RESOLUTION THAN EXISTING TECHNIQUES. (4) THE PH GRADIENT MAY BE ALTERED AT WILL DURING THE FOCUSING RUN TO ACHIEVE MAXIMAL SEPARATION OF ONE OR MORE COMPONENTS FROM A GIVEN STARTING MATERIAL. THE GOAL OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO OPTIMIZE THIS PROCEDURE FOR USE IN BOTH ANALYTICAL AND INDUSTRIAL-SCALE APPLICATIONS. ITS SPECIFIC AIMS ARE TO PRODUCE A MORE POWERFUL AND SOPHISTICATED ELECTRONICS PACKAGE AND TO INVESTIGATE THE USE OF THE TECHNIQUE IN FOCUSING CHANNELS OF VARIOUS CONFIGURATIONS IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE ITS EFFECTIVENESS.

IN THE FIRST APPROACH, TELEMETRY INPUTS ARE MULTIPLEXED INTO A T2 SIGNAL. AS MANY AS 3 OF THESE INPUTS CAN EACH HAVE RATES UP TO 1.8 MB/S. THE SECOND APPROACH INVOLVES AN INVERSE MULTIPLEXER, WHICH SPLITS AT 1.8 MB/S INPUT BETWEEN TWO T1 STREAMS. IN EITHER APPROACH, THE MULTIPLEXED OUTPUT MAY BE USED AS AN INPUT TO AN EXISTING MULTIPLEXER IN DIGITAL MICROWAVE TRANSMISSION SYSTEMS. REMOTE DEMULTIPLEXERS RECONSTITUTE THE ORIGINAL INPUT BIT STREAMS. AFTER ESTABLISHING PRECISE REQUIREMENTS AND PERFORMING PRELIMINARY FEASIBILITY DETERMINATIONS, ONE APPROACH WILL BE SELECTED FOR A DETAILED FEASIBILITY STUDY, INCLUDING MULTIPLEXER FRAME STRUCTURE, SYNCHRONIZATION, SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE, AND PERFORMANCE ESTIMATES. ASSUMING FEASIBILITY IS DEMONSTRATED, A FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATION OF THE SELECTED MULTIPLEXER WILL BE GENERATED.",

THE ELDERLY, BECAUSE OF DEFECTIVE HEAT CONSERVATION, DECREASED HEAT PRODUCTION, MEDICATIONS, IDIOSYNCRATIC RESPONSES TO ILLNESS, SUSCEPTIBILTY TO DISEASES THAT DISRUPT NEUROENDOCRINE FUNCTION, MALNUTRITION,AND SUB-STANDARD HOUSING ARE AT INCREASED RISK FOR HYPOTHERMIA. AMONG THE ELDERLY, HYPOTHERMIA SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASES MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. A MAJOR OBSTACLE TO DETECTING HYPOTHERMIA IS THE LACK OF ACCURATE LOW-READING THERMOMETERS. MEASURING CORE BODY TEMPERATURE FROM THE TEMPERATURE OF FRESHLY VOIDED URINE HAS LONG BEEN ADVOCATED AS THE BEST MEANS TO SCREEN FOR HYPOTHERMIA; UNFORTUNATELY, LOW-READING URINARY THERMOMETERS DO NOT EXIST. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A LOW-READING URINARY THERMOMETER FOR DETECTING HYPOTHERMIA. GOALS OF PHASE I ARETO DEVELOP AND TEST IN VITRO A CHEMICAL TEMPERATURE SENSOR TO DETECT FLUID TEMPERATURES OF 95F OR GREATER. IN PHASE II, PROTOTYPE LOW-READING URINARY THERMOMETERS TO MEASURE TEMPERATURES BETWEEN 90 AND 95F IN 0.5 INCREMENTS WILL BE PRODUCED AND TESTED IN SUBJECTS AT RISK FOR HYPOTHERMIA.",

IMPROVEMENTS IN OPERATIONAL LIFETIME WILL RESULT. MCP GAIN INSTABILITY CAN BE CATEGORIZED INTO SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM LOSSES. THE SHORT TERM INSTABILITY IS CAUSED BY ADSORPTION AND DESORPTION OF GAS MOLECULES LOOSELY BOUND ONTO MICROCHANNEL WALLS WHICH CAN BE ELIMINATED BY INITIAL OUTGASSING AND STABLIZIATION PROCEDURES. LONG TERM GAIN INSTABILITY IS MORE SERIOUS AND IS IRREVERSIBLE. IT IS A DIRECT FUNCTION OF ACCUMULATED OUTPUT CHARGE. SEVERAL UNCONFIRMED MECHANISMS HAVE BEEN POSTULATED AS CAUSING THE LONG TERM LOSS. THESE MECHANISMS REDUCE TO A LOSS IN THE SECONDARY ELECTRON EMISSION YIELD, AND/OR A CHANGE IN THE CHANNEL WALL CONDUCTIVITY. DATA EXISTS ON THE CHANGE IN SECONDARY YIELD, BUT NOT ON THE CONDUCTIVITY CHANGE. THIS WORK WILL MEASURE CONDUCTIVITY CHANGE WITH PROLONGED MCP OPERATION AND WILL DETERMINE THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THIS CHANGE AND THE SECONDARY YIELD CHANGE IN THE GAIN DEGRADATION PROCESS BY PERFORMING A COMPUTER SIMULATION OF MCP GAIN BEHAVIOR. THIS WILL LEAD TO THE TESTING OF PROCESS CHANGES IN PHASE II TO MINIMIZE OR ELIMINATE LONG TERM MCP GAIN LOSS DUE TO AGING.",

IN THIS PROPOSAL UNIQUE GAS CURTAIN SOLDERING EQUIPMENT IS DESCRIBED THAT PRODUCES STRONG, RELIABLE, REPRODUCABLE SOLDER BONDS WITHOUT THE USE OF CHEMICAL FLUXES. ELIMINATION OF FLUXES AND FLUX REMOVAL WILL BE A MAJOR ADVANCE BECAUSE FLUXES ARE ABIETIC ACIDS THAT CAN LATER CAUSE RELIABILITY PROBLEMS IN SMT AND DAIC/PC ASSEMBLIES.

THE SULFUR CONTAINING CERIUM COMPOUND WAS REGENERATED SO THAT IT WAS CAPABLE OF AGAIN REACTING WITH THE H2S. IT IS THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSALTO DEMONSTRATE THE EXTENT OF DESULFURIZATION WITH CERIUM OXIDE OVER A RANGE 1472/2192F (800/1200C) AND CO/C02 RATIOS OF TWO TO SIX, AND TO DESULFURIZE AND REGENERATE BACK TO CERIUM OXIDE A NUMBER OF TIMES. PRESENTLY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY FOR DESULFURIZATION OF FUEL GASES WITH OXIDES OF IRON, ZINC, COBALT, ETC. IS LIMITED TO FUEL GASES WITH CO/C02 RATIOS THAT SELDOM EXCEED 1.0 AT TEMPERATURES THAT ARE GENERALLY LESS THAT 1200 (649 ). IT HAS BEEN CALCULATED THAT FUEL GASES PRODUCED IN AN AIR BLOWNGASIFIER AT 1200F A CO/C02 OF ONE AND A CALORIFIC VALUE OF 110 BTU/SCF. IF AN AIR BLOWN GASIFIER IS OPERATED AT 1760F (927C), THE CO/C02 RATIO OF THE FUEL GAS MAY BE AS HIGH AS EIGHT AND THE CALORIFIC VALUE HAS BEEN CALCULATED TOBE 150 BTU/SCF-A 36% INCREASE IN BTU VALUE COMPARED TO THAT OBTAINED BY LOW TEMPERATURE GASIFIER OPERATION. THIS INCREASE IN BTU VALUE OF THE FUEL GAS DUE TO HIGHER TEMPERATURE GASIFIER OPERATION, AND DESULFURIZATION WITH CERIUM OXIDE AT A HIGHER TEMPERATURE, WHICH WOULD INCREASE THE SENSIBLE HEAT IN THE FUEL GAS, SHOULD INCREASE THE OVERALL THERMAL EFFICIENCY OF ANY PROCESS USING FUEL GASES. THE DESULFURIZATION STEP IS A NON-CATALYTIC REACTION BETWEEN THE GAS AND THE SOLID, NON-STOICHIOMETRIC REACTANT: 2CEO(2-X) (S)+H2S(G)+1-2X)H2(G)= CE202S(S)+2(1-X)H20(G). REGENERATION CAN BE SIMPLY REPRESENTED BY THE FOLLOWING: CE202S(S)+202(G)=CE02(S)+S02(G) ALL OF THE CERIUM COMPOUNDS HAVE MELTING POINTS IN EXCESS OF 3000F (1649), AND THEIR CHEMICAL STABILITY IS SUCH THEY CAN NOT BE REDUCED BY FUEL GASES. THE CONCENTRATION OF S02 GIVEN OFF DURING REGENERATION IS HIGH ENOUGH TO BE SUITABLE AS A FEED FOR A CLAUS PLANT. THE RESULTS FROM PHASE I WILL DEFINE THE SULFUR CAPTURE EFFICIENCY OF CERIUM OXIDE OVER A WIDE RANGE OF GAS COMPOSITIONS AND TEMPERATURES, AND CONFIRM THE VALIDITY OF THE PREDICTED REGENERATION PROCESS FOR THE SULFUR-CONTAINING COMPOUNDS BACK TO CERIUM OXIDE. PHASE II WILL PROVIDE THE NECESSARY KINETIC DATA FOR THE DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATING OF A PHASE II PILOT PLANT AND THEEVENTUAL CONSTRUCTION OF A COMMERCIAL DESULFURIZATION UNIT USING THIS TECHNOLOGY. ANY ATTEMPT TO DESIGN A FACILITY USING THIS PROCESS WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE PRIOR TO THE COMPLETION OF PHASE II. FUEL GASES PRODUCED BY COAL GASIFICATION AT HIGH TEMPERATURES AND DESULFURIZED AT HIGH TEMPERATURES, CAN BE USED WITH INCREASED THERMAL EFFICIENCY, AS A FUEL FORM COMBINED CYCLE POWER PLANTS, FUEL CELLS, AND TO AFIRE THE BOILERS OF ELECTRIC POWER GENERATING STATIONS IF THE EPA REQUIREMENTS FOR SULFUR EMISSION FROM SUCH UNITS ARE LOWERED.",

IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE ANTIBODIES, MORE ANTIBODIES DIRECTED AGAINST DETERMINANTS OF THE RH SYSTEM WILL BE MADE. THIS WILL BE DONE USING A HUMAN MYELOMA FUSION PARTNER TO IMMORTALIZE SENSITIZED LYMPHOCYTES OBTAINED FROM RH IMMUNE DONORS. THE GENES FOR THESE ANTI- BODIES WILL THEN BE MANIPULATED BY A VARIETY OF DNA CLONING TECHNIQUES TO INCREASE THE AFFINITY AND TO SWITCH THE ISOTYPES.

FOR ROUTINE BULK ANALYSIS OF SEMICONDUCTOR SUBSTRATES, EPITAXIAL FILMS, DOPANTS, OR SOURCE MATERIALS, THE FOLLOWING CONCEPT IS PROPOSED. A SPECIALLY DESIGNED ELECTROTHERMAL ATOMIZER WOULD CONTAIN THE SOLID OR LIQUID SAMPLE AND CUSTOM SOFTWARE WOULD BE WRITTEN TO COLLECT ANALYTICAL DATA AS A FUNCTION OF THE THREE DIMENSIONS OF ION COUNTS, ATOMIC MASS, AND FURNANCE TEMPERATURE. BY THE PROPER CHOICE OF THE CARRIER GAS PASSING OVER THE SAMPLE, SEPARATION OF THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS CONTAINED IN THE SAMPLE SHOULD BE ACHIEVABLE IN THE THIRD DIMENSION OF TEMPERATURE. SPATIAL SEPARATION IN THE TEMPERATURE DIMENSION COULD BE USED TO ELIMINATE MANY MASS INTERFERENCE. DETECTION LIMITS FOR MOST ELEMENTS OF THE PERIODIC CHART ARE EXPECTED TO RANGE BETWEEN 0.01 AND 0.1 PPB. DEPTH PROFILES SHOULD BE ACHIEVABLE BY MASKING OFF THE AREA TO BE PROTECTED AND MOUNTING THE SAMPLE INSIDE THE ATOMIZER TUBE. THE CARRIER GAS WOULD THEN BE PASSED OVER THE SURFACE OF THE MOUNTED SAMPLE AT A TEMPERATURE SUFFICIENT TO ATOMIZE THE ELEMENTS OF INTEREST. THE TIME DIMENSION OF THIS THREE DIMENSIONAL DATA SET OF ION COUNTS, ATOMIC MASS, AND TIME COULD BE CALIBRATED TO DEPTH AND A PROFILE OF EACH ELEMENT AND ITS ISOTOPE RATIOS COULD BE CREATED WITH SUB-PPB SENSITIVITY.",

THE SPECIFIC AIM OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP ATECHNIQUE THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED ONLINE IN REALTIME FOR REMOVING THE EOG INFLUENCE FROM THE OBSERVED EEG. GIVEN THAT ALL EYE MOVEMENTS AND BLINKS RESULT IN EOG ELECTRICAL SIGNALS CHARACTERIZED BY AMPLITUDE, FREQUENCY, AND PHASE, ANEXTERNAL DRIVE SIGNAL APPLIED NEAR THE EYE WITH THE FULL BANDWIDTH OF SIGNAL CHARACTERISTICS CAN EMULATE THE NATURAL EOG. THIS, ALONG WITH THE OBSERVATION OF THIS DRIVE'S INFLUENCE ON DISTANT EEG ELECTRODES, WILL ALLOW AN ESTIMA- TION OF THE ATTENUATION FACTORS, OR TRANSFER FUNCTION, OF THIS DRIVE SIGNAL. THIS TRANSFER FUNCTION, THEN, CAN BE USED TO CORRECT THE EEG BY SUBTRACTING THE WEIGHTED NATURAL EOG.

GUMBS WILL DESIGN AND SYNTHESIZE LIQUID POLYMERS WITH REACTIVE GROUPS TO PERMIT CROSSLINKING, POLAR GROUPS TO INCREASE ADHESION, AND HYDROPHOBIC UNITS FOR LOW- WATER SORPTION. THE PROPOSED SYNTHETIC PROCESS IS VERSATILETO PERMIT OPTIMIZATION OF THE CHEMICAL, PHYSICAL, AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THE RESIN. STRUCTURE-PROPERTY STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO FIND WAYS TO ACHIEVE MINIMAL SHRINKAGEON POLYMERIZATION, INCREASE THE VOLUME OF FILLER IN DENTAL COMPOSITES, REDUCE SORPTION, PROMOTE ADHESION, AND GENERALLYOPTIMIZE THE PHYSICAL AND MECHANICAL STABILITY OF THE CURED RESIN. VIRTUALLY ALL DENTAL COMPOSITES AND SEALANTS IN USE TODAY CONTAIN THE DENTAL MONOMER BIS-GMA. THE HIGH VISCOSITY OF THIS MONOMER REQUIRES THE USE OF DILUENT MONOMERS TO ACHIEVE A WORKABLE VISCOSITY. THIS RESULTS IN AN INCREASE IN SHRINKAGE DURING THE HARDENING PROCESS, CAUSING A SHEARING STRESS AND A MARGINAL GAP BETWEEN THE CAVITY WALL AND THE RESTORATION.",

ONE UNIQUE FEATURE OF THESE SYSTEMS WILL BE THEIR USE OF CD/ROM STORAGE TECHNOLOGY, WHICH PROVIDES A STORAGE CAPACITY OF OVER 500 MEGABYTES; IT IS EXPENSIVE, AND CONNECTS EASILY TO BOTH PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND MINICOMPUTERS. THIS PHASE I STUDY WILL DEVELOP COMPLETESPECIFICATIONS AND COST ANALYSES FOR TWO KINDS OF SYSTEMS. THE FIRST IS A MICROCOMPUTER RETRIEVAL SYSTEM FOR PERSONAL COMPUTER USERS; THE SECOND IS A MINICOMPUTER RETRIEVAL SYSTEM FOR MULTI-USER ENVIRONMENTS. IN ADDITION, IN PHASE I, A PROTOTYPE OF THE MICROCOMPUTER RETRIEVAL SYSTEM WILL BEDEVELOPED AND DEMONSTRATED THAT WILL ACCESS PORTIONS OF THE PHYSICIAN'S DATA QUERY (PDQ) AND CANCERLIT DATABASES AND FULL-TEXT JOURNAL ARTICLES. IN THE EVENT OF A PHASE II AWARD, A COMPLETE SOFTWARE SET FOR BOTH MICROCOMPUTER AND MINICOMPUTER RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS WILL BE GENERATED. THESE SYSTEMS WILL PROVIDE USERS WITH LOW COST ACCESS TO INFORMATION WITHOUT THE NEED FOR ANY TELECOMMUNICATIONS LINKTO A CENTRAL INFORMATION SOURCE AND WILL ALLOW A WIDER AUDIENCE TO HAVE ACCESS TO CANCER PREVENTION AND CONTROL INFORMATION.",

THIS ANTIGEN IS A GENE PRODUCT OF ONE ALLELE OF A BI-ALLELIC SYSTEM HAVING THE OBSERVED DISTRIBUTION OF: PLA1A1=0.69; PLA1A2= 0.28; AND PLA2A2=0.03. EXPOSURE TO THE PLA1 ANTIGEN CAN INDUCE ALLOIMMUNIZATION IN PLA2A2 INDIVIDUALS AFTER PLATELETTRANSFUSIONS OR DURING PREGNANCY IN PLA2A2 MOTHERS CARRYING PLA1A2 INFANTS. THIS ALLOIMMUNIZATION PRODUCES ANTI-PLA1 ANTIBODIES WHICH CAN RESULT IN SEVERE THROMBOCYTOPENIA IN BOTH POST-TRANSFUSION PURPURA OR IN IMMUNE NEONATAL THROMBO-CYTOPENIA. SINCE A LARGE FRACTION OF THE POPULATION IS PLA1A1, THEY MAY, IN A SIMILAR MANNER, DEVELOP ALLOANTI- BODIES TO THE PLA2 ANTIGEN. THIS PROCESS MAY ACCOUNT FOR PATIENTS WHO BECOME REFRACTORY TO PLATELET TRANSFUSION DURING PLATELET SUPPORT THERAPY AND WHO SHOW EVIDENCE OF PLATELET-SPECIFIC ANTIBODIES UNRELATED TO ANTI-HLA SENSITI- ZATION. THEREFORE, THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT CLINICAL USE FOR A SYSTEM WHICH CAN DETECT THE PRESENCE OF THESE SPECIFIC ANTI-PLATELET ANTIBODIES AND DETERMINE THE PHENOTYPE OF RECIPIENTS OF PLATELET TRANSFUSIONS AND OF EXPECTANT MOTHERS. A NEW, SIMPLE, SPECIFIC ASSAY TECHNIQUE FOR DETECTION OF THE ANTI-PLA1 OR -PLA2 ANTIBODIES IN PATIENT SERA HAS BEEN DEVELOPED; USING THE SAME TECHNOLOGY, AN ASSAYFOR QUANTITATION OF THESE TWO ANTIGENS ON PLATELET SURFACES TO DETERMINE THE PLATELET PLA1/A2 PHENOTYPE WAS ESTABLISHED.BOTH ASSAYS USE LABELED, PURIFIED GPIII IN A QUANTITATIVE IMMUNOPRECIPITATION ASSAY.

CURRENT METHODS OF DIAGNOSING MALE INFERTILITY BY MICRO- SCOPIC EXAMINATION OF THE SEMEN SPECIMEN ARE INADEQUATE, AND MORE RELIABLE TESTS NEED TO BE DEVELOPED. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO DEVELOP SUCH A TEST BY USING A SILICA WOOL FILTRATION TECHNIQUE. THE METHOD IS BASED ON THE OBSERVATION THAT SILICA (GLASS) WOOL FIBERS FILTER OUT NON- MOTILE SPERMATOZOA WITH CHEMICALLY INACTIVE OF PHYSICALLY DAMAGED MEMBRANES. THUS, WITH A SIMPLE ONE-STEP METHOD, ONECAN DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF VIABLE SPERMATOZOA IN A SEMEN SAMPLE WITHOUT HAVING TO PERFORM ANALYSES FOR SPERM MOTILITY, THE EOSIN Y STAIN, OR THE HYPOOSMOTIC SWELLING TEST. THE NUMBER OF VIABLE SPREMATOZOA IN AN EJACULATE SHOULD BE A GOOD INDICATION OF THE POTENTIAL FERTILIZING CAPACITY OF THE SEMEN. DUE TO ITS SIMPLICITY, THE FILTRA- TION TEST CAN READILY BE USED IN PRIVATE PRACTICE OR UNDER OTHER CONDITIONS WHERE TRAINED TECHNICIANS ARE NOT AVAILABLE. PHASE I OF THE PROJECT IS AIMED AT ESTABLISHING THE FEASIBILITY OF THE TECHNIQUE AND EVALUATING WHETHER IT WILL YIELD CONSISTENT, RELIABLE, AND REPRODUCIBLE RESULTS. ALSO, THE CORRELATION OF THIS TEST WITH THE ZONA-FREE HAMSTER OOCYTE PENETRATING ABILITY WILL BE COMPARED TO THAT OF THE MORE STANDARD PARAMETERS.

THE GOALOF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A HIGHLY SENSITIVE AND ACCURATE ERYTHROPOIETIN ASSAY FOR USE IN ERYTHROPOIETIN RESEARCH AND FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF DISEASES. SUCH AN ASSAY IS CURRENTLY NOT AVAILABLE COMMERCIALLY. IN PHASE I, MONOCLONAL AND POLYCLONAL ANTIBODIES WILL BE PRODUCED AGAINST TWO DIFFERENT SYNTHETIC ERYTHROPOIETIN PEPTIDES. ONE PEPTIDE CONSISTS OF AN INTERNAL HYDROPHILIC REGION OF THE ERYTHROPOIETIN MOLECULE, AND THE OTHER PEPTIDE INCLUDES THE CARBOXY TERMINAL AMINO ACIDS. THESE ANTIBODIES WILL BE TESTED FOR THEIR SUITABILITY FOR USE IN DIAGNOSTIC TESTS. THE PRODUCTION OF HIGHLY SPECIFIC ANTIBODIES AGAINST TWO POTENTIALLY DIFFERENT ERYTHROPOIETIN EPITOPES IN PHASE I WILL GREATLY FACILITATE THE DESIGN OF A NOVEL, EASY FORMAT FOR A HIGHLY ACCURATE AND SENSITIVE NONRADIOACTIVE ERYTHROPOIETIN IMMUNOASSAY IN PHASE II.",

IN ORDER FOR THIS IDEAL SITUATION TO COME ABOUT, IT IS NECES-SARY FIRST TO SOLVE SOME IMPORTANT PROBLEMS IN THE MATHEMATICS OF CONTROL SYSTEMS AS WELL AS IN COMPUTATIONAL TECHNIQUES. PHASE I OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH PROGRAM IS ADDRESSED TO STUDYING THE FEASIBILITY OF SOLVING SOME OF THE PROBLEMS. AMONG THE PROBLEMS WE PROPOSE TO STUDY ARE THE FOLLOWING: (I) NEW APPROACHES TO THE SIMULTANEOUS STABILIZATION PROBLEM, (II) UNCERTAINTY MODELLING, (III) NUMERICAL TECHNIQUES FOR CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS, AND (IV) STABILITY OF REDUCED ORDER ADAPTIVE CONTROL. THESE PROBLEMS ARE INTIMATELY CONNECTED, EACH PROBLEM BEING AN ESSENTIAL TASK IN A TYPICAL INTERACTIVE CAD PROCEDURE.",

MUCH DATA EXIST IN THE LITERATURE FOR MATERIALS SUCH AS TEFLON, POLYETHYLENE, TANTALUM, ETC., WHICH ARE COMMONLY USED THROUGHOUT THE ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY. A NEED EXISTS TO COLLECT AND CHARACTERIZE THESE DATA IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHAT ADDITIONAL MEASUREMENTS ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE SET. PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTS HAVE DEMONSTRATED A DEPENDENCE ON PHOTON ENERGY, TEMPERATURE, PRESSURE, BIAS, AND PREVIOUS HISTORY OF THE MATERIAL. IN ADDITION, EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES CAN RESULT IN LARGE MEASUREMENT ERRORS DUE TO SPACECHARGE EFFECTS UNLESS CAREFULLY DESIGNED AND CONTROLLED TESTS ARE CONDUCTED. DURING THE PHASE I EFFORT, A CATALOG OF EXISTING DATA WILL BE PRODUCED BASED UPON A DETAILED LITERATURE SEARCH. THE DATA WILL BE CHARACTERIZED AND MISSING DATA IDENTIFIED. SINCE RADIATION-INDUCED DIELECTRIC CONDUCTIVITY CANNOT BE EASILY COMPUTED FROM FIRST PRINCIPLES, A NEW SERIES OF TESTS WILL BE DESIGNED THAT INCORPORATE TECHNIQUES TO ACCOUNT FOR SPACECHARGE EFFECTS AND PRELIMINARY HARDWARE WILL BE FABRICATED TO VALIDATE THE CONCEPTS. THEN, DURING PHASE II, AN EXTENSIVE SERIES OF TESTS WILL BE CONDUCTED TO COMPLETE THE DATA SET OF DIELECTRIC CONDUCTIVITY EFFECTS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF IONIZING RADIATION.",

IN THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION, TWO CONTINUOUS-WAVE CO(2) GAS LASERS WITH POWER LEVELS 5 KW (MULTI MODE BEAM) AND 1.2 KW (GAUSSIAN BEAM) WILL BE EMPLOYED TO CLAD THERMAL BARRIER COATINGS USING A MELT/PARTICLE INJECTION PROCESS. THE COATING SEQUENCE INVOLVES A BOND-COAT OF NICRALY, FOLLOWED BY AN INTERMEDIATE COAT OF AL(2)O(3) AND AN OVERCOAT OF ZROO(2)/Y(2)O(3). THE PURPOSE OF INTERMEDIATE AL(2)O(3) COATING IS TO PREVENT THE OXIDATION OF BOND-COAT DURING ITS HIGH TEMPERATURE USE AND TO ENHANCE THERMALBARRIER CHARACTERISTICS. CYCLIC OXIDATION TESTS AT 2000 DEG F WILL BE CONDUCTED TO EVALUATE THE HIGH-TEMPERATURE PREFORMANCE OF CLADDINGS. LIGHT MICROSCOPY, SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY, MICROPROBE ANALYSIS, AND HARDNESS TESTS WILL BE USED TO CHARACTERIZE THE COATINGS BEFORE AND AFTER HIGH-TEMPERATURE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE.

THESE PROBLEMS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE PARAMETERS CONTROLLING THE RATE OF CHEMICAL ENERGY RELEASE AND CONVERSION AND HENCE OF THE EFFECTIVE USE AND SAFE HANDLING OF CHEMICAL EXPLOSIVES. IN PHASE I OF THIS PROPOSAL, OUR OBJECTIVES ARE (1) TO INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY OF USING A MODERN MICROCOMPUTER (E.G., IBM-AT + DSI-32 COPROCESSOR BOARD) FOR DOING LARGE SCALE MOLECULAR DYNAMICS CALCULATIONS AND (2) TO STUDY THE INITIATION OF DETONATION IN A TWO-DIMENSIONAL ENERGETIC CRYSTAL CONTAINING VACANCIES AND MASS DEFECTS AS A SAMPLE OF COMPUTER SIMULATION OF THE DETONATION PROBLEM FROM A MICROSCOPIC VIEWPOINT.

THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THE LAST ISSUE IN TERMS OF PATIENT-CONTROLLED, IONTOPHORETIC DELIVERY OF NARCOTIC AGENTS ON THE BATTLEFIELD. IONTOPHORESIS UTILIZED FOR DRUG DELIVERY HAS A VENERABLE HISTORY YET TO THIS DAY, ITS APPLICATION IS LIMITED TO SHORT PROCEDURES OF 15-30 MINUTES. THE MAJOR IMPEDIMENT TO TREATMENTS LASTING OF THE ORDER OF 6-12 HOURS HAS BEEN THE FORMATION OF ELECTROLYTIC PRODUCTS (H+ IN THE POSITIVE ELECTROD AND OHIN THE NEGATIVE ELECTRODE), WHICH RAPIDLY LOWER THE EFFICIENCY OF DRUG TRANSPORT. THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN ADDRESSED BY OUR GROUP OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS USING MORPHINE AS THE MODEL DRUG. OUR CLINICAL STUDIES HAVE ACHIEVED A DELIVERY OF 5-6 MG FOR OVER TWO HOURS. THE GOALS IN PHSE I OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE: 1) TO PROLONG FURTHER THE DELIVERY TIME OF MORPHINE FROM A SINGLE ELECTRODE-RECEPTACLE; 2) TO INVESTIGATE THE RATE OF SYSTEMIC UPTAKE OF MORPHINE IN PIGS EXSANGUINATED BY 20% AND THEN 30% OF TOTAL BLOOD VOLUMES, EACH ANIMAL ACTING AS ITS OWN CONTROL; AND 3) TO CONSTRUCT A PROTOTYPE, PATIENTCONTROLLED IONTOPHORETIC DRUG DELIVERY UNIT FOR USE IN FIELD CONDITIONS: AN ADHESIVE PATCH CONTAINING MORPHINE, BATTERY SUPPLY AND CURRENT CONTROL. IN PHASE II THIS DEVICE WILL BE REFINED AND INTEGRATED INTO ONE UNIT, PRODUCED IN MUCH LARGER NUMBERS FOR USE IN CLINICAL TRIALS AND THE MORPHINE QUANTITY WILL BE IN GEL, PASTE OR GUM FORM, PRIMARILY TO PREVENT LEAKAGE OF CONTENTS BEFORE, DURING OR AFTER CLINICAL APPLICATION.",

THIS KNOWLEDGE WILL BE USEFUL IN SELECTING THE BEST ANTIHYPER- TENSIVE REGIMEN FOR INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS, RESULTING IN BETTERBLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL, FEWER MEDICATIONS, FEWER ADVERSE SIDE EFFECTS, AND BETTER PRESCRIPTION COMPLIANCE. IN ORDER TO DEVELOP MARKET POTENTIAL, INNOVATION IS REQUIRED IN TWO AREAS: (1) THE EASE OF USE OF NONINVASIVE CARDIAC OUTPUT MEASUREMENT MUST BE ENHANCED TO MATCH THE EXPECTED OPERATOR SKILL LEVELS FOUND IN THE OUTPATIENT TREATMENT SETTING. (2)HYPERTENSION TREATMENT PRACTICES MUST BE CHANGED FROM THE ACCEPTED \"STEPPED CARE\" DRUG THERAPY PROTOCOLS TO ONE THAT SELECTS THE BEST DRUG TREATMENT REGIMEN BASED ON EACH PATIENT'S HEMODYNAMIC PATTERN. IN PHASE I, LAWRENCE'S CURRENT CONTINUOUS CARDIAC OUTPUT MEASUREMENT SYSTEM WILL BEMODIFIED AND ITS ACCURACY WILL BE VERIFIED FOR USE IN THE PHYSICIAN'S OFFICE. PHASE II WILL BE A MULTI-CENTER STUDY OF THE BENEFITS OF HEMODYNAMIC-BASED, CONTROLLED DRUG THERAPY FOR HYPERTENSION.",

IT APPEARS POSSIBLE FROM THIS AND OTHER STUDIES THAT A RELATIVELY LOW INTAKE OF EPA- FISH OILS ON A CHRONIC BASIS MAY SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE THE RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY. LIPID SPECIALTIES HAS RECENTLY PROCESSED A FISH OIL TO CONTAIN 30% EPA WITHOUT HEAVY METAL OR PCB CONTAMINATION. PHASE I RESEARCH WILL FOCUS ON STABILIZING EPA-FISH OILS USING TOCOPHEROLS AND A NEW CLASS OF SEMISYNTHETIC PHOSPHOLIPIDS, THE LIPID X SURFACTANTS.

AN UNDERSTANDING OF STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION CAN BE USED TO DETERMINE THE CAUSES OF OBSERVED FAULTS. OPTICAL TEST SEQUENCING AND MINIMIZATION ARE ALSO GREATLY FACILITATED BY THE USE OF AI TECHNIQUES. TO DATE, HOWEVER, THE APPLICATION OF AI TO DIAGNOSTICS HAS LARGELY BEEN IN AN EXPERIMENTAL OFF-LINE FASHION. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP THE LINKING TECHNOLOGIES WHICH WILL ALLOW ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS TO ACCESS A WIDE RANGE OF STANDARD BUS-DRIVEN INSTRUMENTATION AND ATLAS COMPATIBLE AUTOMATIC TEST EQUIPMENT. THESE LINKS WILL PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR THE DIRECT APPLICATION OF ANY NUMBER OF AI TECHNIQUES TO THE SOLUTION OF REAL WORLD MAINTENANCE PROBLEMS. IN ADDITION, AI OFFERS THE POTENTIAL FOR FAST IMPROVEMENTS IN THE QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY OF PROGRAMS WRITTEN IN ATLAS, THE MOST WIDELY USED TEST EQUIPMENT CONTROL LANGUAGE.",

THIS RESEARCH PROPOSAL IS DIRECTED AT DEVELOPING THE LARGE-FORMAT CAPABILITY OF NEWDISPLAY TECHNOLOGY. THE BASIC CONCEPTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN A MONOCHROME PANEL ONLY 4 INCHES THICK. THEFLATSCREEN PROTOTYPE DISPLAYS A 4-SQUARE-FOOT STANDARD TELEVISION IMAGE OR COMPUTER GRAPHICS WITH THE GREY SCALE AND BRIGHTNESS OF A CRT. THIS RESEARCH EFFORT WILL PRODUCE A FULL-SIZE PROTOTYPE OF A COMPLIANT VACUUM ENCLOSURE TO PROVE ITS DESIGN CONCEPTS. THE CURRENT RIGID STRUCTURES ARENOT SUITABLE FOR PRODUCTION. SOME OF THE BASIC PRINCIPLES IN THIS ENCLOSURE DESIGN HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN SMALL TEST CELLS, BUT SCALING THE TECHNIQUES TO A FULL-SIZE PANEL INVOLVES RESEARCH ON MATERIALS, WELDING, AND OTHER FABRICATION PROBLEMS THAT ARE CONSTRAINED BY THE PHYSICS OF THE DISPLAY TECHNOLOGY. THE ADVANTAGES OF THIS FLAT-PANEL CONCEPT INCLUDE THE FACT THAT IT CAN BE MOUNTED ON THE WALL,YET HAVE AN IMAGE AREA LARGE ENOUGH TO DISPLAY TWO LIFE- SIZE BODY IMAGES AT ONCE.

PROPOSES TO EXPLORE THE FEASIBILITY OF EXPLOITING MULTIPATH EFFECTS BY ANSWERING TWO FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS: A) HOW MUCH OF THE TIME DURING A THREAT ENGAGEMENT IS A LOW ALTITUDE COMBAT AIRCRAFT IN A POSITION SUCH THAT THE TERRAIN BETWEEN THE JAMMER AND THE THREAT ANTENNA WILL SUPPORT MULTIPATH? B) DURING THOSE PERIODS IN WHICH MULTIPATH EXISTS, WHAT IS THE JAMMING SIGNAL STRENGTH RATIO OF THE DIRECT PATH TO INDIRECT PATH FOR DIFFERENT ENGAGEMENT GEOMETRIES AND TERRAIN TYPES; AND WHAT ARE THE ACTUAL VALUES OF THE TWO SIGNAL (DIRECT AND INDIRECT) FOR DIFFERENT TERRAIN/RCS/THREAT/JAMMER COMBINATIONS? ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS WILL INDICATE WHETHER AN AIRCRAFT FLYING A REALISTIC COMBAT ENGAGEMENT CARRYING NOMENCLATURED EQUIPMENT CAN EXPECT TO EXPLOIT MULTIPATH EFFECTS.

THE GROWTH OF POWERFUL, TEMPEST-HARDENED, PORTABLE COMPUTERS THAT HAS MADE THIS PROLIFERATION POSSIBLE BRINGS WITH IT THE NEED FOR EQUALLY PORTABLE, TEMPEST-HARDENED PRINTERS. THERE HAS BEEN GREAT PROGRESS IN PRODUCING SMALLER, FULL FEATURED, LIGHT-WEIGHT PRINTERS FOR THE COMMERCIAL MARKETPLACE. HOWEVER, THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE EFFORT EXPENDED IN MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE MILITARY IN THIS AREA. THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THE PROBLEMS INVOLVED AND THE FEASIBILITY OF PRODUCING A MILITARIZED, TEMPEST-HARDENED, LIGHT-WEIGHT PRINTER WHICH FULFILLS THE SPECIFICATIONS LISTED IN THE SBIR SPECIFICATION A86-58. TWO APPROACHES ARE DISCUSSED: 1) MODIFYING AN EXISTING COMMERCIAL PRINTER, AND 2) DESIGNING A NEW PRINTER. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED EFFORT IS TO COMPLETE A PHASE I WORK PLAN, WHICH WHEN EXECUTED IN PHASE II, WILL PRODUCE THE DESIRED PRINTER. THE FINAL RESULT OF PHASE I WILL BE A DETAILED ENGINEERING PLAN FOR MODIFYING AN EXISTING PRINTER, OR A SET OF DETAILED PLANS FOR A PROPOSED NEW PROTOTYPE PRINTER DESIGNED ON THE BASIS OF THE PREVIOUS STEPS.",

THUS, SUPERFICIAL THERMAL SOURCES OVERWHELM THE DEEPER SOURCES. THIS LIMITATION IMPEDES RADIOMETER APPLICATION TO DIATHERMY/HYPERTHERMIA CONTROL. AS HYPERTHERMIA IS A VALUABLE ADJUNCT TO RADIOTHERAPY AND CHEMOTHERAPY IN THE TREATMENT OF CANCER, THESE LIMITATIONS MAY AFFECT OVERALL PROGRESS IN THE AREA. AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD TO ENHANCE RADIOMETRIC SENSIBILITY TO DEPTH THERMAL SOURCES IS THE USE OF MULTIPLE ANTENNAS WITH CROSS-PRODUCT PROCESSING TO SCAN A ZONE COMMON TO TWO ANTENNAS. CROSS- PRODUCT PROCESSING ENHANCES SENSIBILITY OF DEPTH SOURCES BY PEAKING THE SYSTEM'S RESPONSE AT VARIOUS RANGES. IN ADDITION, CORRELATION RADIOMETRY ENHANCES SPATIAL AND THERMAL RESOLUTION BY THE DETECTION OF THERMAL GRADIENTS. THE CORRELATION RADIOMETER IS ESPECIALLY SUITABLE FOR USE WITH TWO PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED WAVEGUIDES, 918 MHZ CONTACT APPLICATORS.

POLY(I)MERCAPTOPOLY(C) IS SUPERIOR TO THE WELL-KNOWN INTERFERON INDUCER POLY(I)POLY(C). IN ITS ANTI- PROLIFERATIVE EFFECTS AGAINST HUMAN TUMOR CELLS, AS WELL AS IN ITS INTERFERON INDUCING ACTIVITY. FURTHERMORE, POLY(I) MPC IS LESS TOXIC IN ANIMALS THAN THE UNMODIFIED POLY(I) POLY(C). THUS, THE POTENTIAL OF POLY(I)MPC AS A USEFUL ANTITUMOR AND ANTIVIRAL DRUG IS GOOD. HOWEVER, USING PRESENT TECHNOLOGY, IT COSTS $2,000 TO PRODUCE ONE GRAM OF POLY(I)MPC. A SPECIFIC AIM OF THIS GRANT APPLICATION IS TO DEVELOP A METHOD TO PRODUCE MPC, AND THUS POLY(I)MPC, LESS EXPENSIVELY, MAKING LARGER QUANTITIES OF POLY(I)MPC AFFORDABLE FOR PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL TESTING. IT IS PROPOSED THAT THE STARTING MATERIALS, POLY(I) AND POLY(C), WILL BE PREPARED USING AN IMMOBILIZED ENZYME SYSTEM AND THATTHE THIOLATION OF POLY(C) IN A BUFFERED AQUEOUS SOLUTION WILL BE DEVELOPED AND SCALED-UP TO CUT LABOR COST. ANOTHER SPECIFIC AIM IS TO CONFIRM THE IN VIVO ANTITUMOR ACTIVITIES OF POLY(I)MPC AND OF MPC. FAVORABLE RESULTS SHOULD LEAD TO LONGER-TERM OBJECTIVES, WHICH WOULD INCLUDE DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER MERCAPTOPOLYNUCLEOTIDES, SCALE-UP AND PRODUCTION FOR BIOLOGICAL AND CLINICAL STUDIES, AND SUBSEQUENT COMMERCIALIZATION.",

MANY MEANS HAVE BEEN ADOPTED TO INCREASE THE SNR (PARTUCULARLY BAD FOR LOW FREQUENCIES, E.G., BELOW 2 HZ), INCLUDING USE OF SECOND-ORDER GRADIOMETERS AND THE USE OF EXTRA NOISE REFERENCE CHANNELS. AS SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS OF THE \"NOISE\" CHANGE CHARACTER OVER TIME, SIMPLE SUBTRAC- TION SCHEMES IN WHICH A FIXED PORTION OF THE NOISE REFERENCEIS SUBTRACTED FROM THE MEG ARE NOT OPTIMAL.

THE TECHNOLOGY IS BASED ON FIBER OPTICS AND IMMUNOASSAY PRINCIPLES, THAT IS, A RECEPTOR IS SELECTED FOR A DRUG, AND THE QUENCHING OF A FLUORESCENTLY LABELED ANALOG OF THE DRUG IS USED TO MEASURE THE EXTENT OF BINDING BETWEEN RECEPTOR AND DRUG. WHILE IMMUNOASSAYS ARE DISCRETE TESTS, THE BIO- SENSOR TECHNOLOGY BEING DEVELOPED PROVIDES CONTINUOUS ONLINEMONITORING. THE ANTIBODY OR ITS EQUIVALENT AND A HIGH MW FLUORESCENT ANALOG ARE RETAINED IN A SELECTIVELY POROUS MICRO TEST TUBE, FORMED BY A HOLLOW DIALYSIS FIBER (-300 MICRONS DIAMETER). THE BIOSENSOR READILY RESPONDS TO EXTERNAL CONCENTRATION CHANGES OF ANALYTE DUE TO THE REVERSIBLE DISPLACEMENT OF THE FLUORESCENT ANALOG FROM THE RECEPTOR. FLUORESCENT INTENSITY IS MONITORED WITH A SINGLE OPTICAL FIBER INSERTED INTO THE HOLLOW DIALYSIS FIBER.

SHORT DNA PROBES OF 20 TO 30 NUCLEOTIDES HAVE THE DESIRABLE PROPERTIES OF HIGH SPECIFICITY, FAST REACTION KINETICS, POTENTIAL HIGH SENSITIVITY, AND THE ABILITY TO BE SYNTHESIZED RAPIDLY IN LARGE AMOUNTS AT LOW COST. THEIR INHERENT HIGH SPECIFICITY IS AN IMPORTANT ATTRIBUTE. IT IS POSSIBLE TO DESIGN IN SITUHYBRIDIZATION ASSAYS THAT CAN DETECT AND DISCRIMINATE ANY OFTHE HPV TYPES PRESENTLY IDENTIFIED. WITH SHORT DNA PROBES, THE RESEARCHERS WILL DEMONSTRATE THAT A UNIVERSAL FORMAT FORIN SITU HYBRIDIZATION CAN BE DEVELOPED USING 2.4 M TETRA- ETHYLAMMONIUM CHLORIDE (TEACL) IN THE HYBRIDIZATION OR WASH STEPS. THIS SALT SOLUTION ALLOWS HYBRIDIZATION AND HYBRID MELTING REACTIONS TO OCCUR SOLELY AS A FUNCTION OF PROBE LENGTH. HENCE, SHORT PROBES OF THE SAME LENGTH (E.G., 25 MERS) WILL HAVE THE SAME HYBRIDIZATION AND MELTING PROPERTIES. IN ADDITION, THE PROJECT WILL DEMONSTRATE THAT AGITATION OF THE HYBRIDIZATION AND WASH STEPS WITH ULTRA- SOUND WILL SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASE THE TIME REQUIRED FOR THE IN SITU DETECTION OF THE VARIOUS TYPES OF HPV FROM THE 24 TO48 HOURS NOW REQUIRED. THE USE OF SHORT PROBES IN CONJUNCTION WITH TEACL SALTS AND ULTRASOUND IS EXPECTED TO BE IMPORTANT IN THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF DNA PROBE TECHNOLOGY FOR USE IN CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS.",

HIGH-SPEED MEASUREMENT OF DIMENSIONS WILL BE EVALUATED USING NON-CONTACT OPTICAL, EDDY CURRENT AND CAPACITANCE SENSING AS WELL AS WITH CONTACT LVDT BASED SENSORS. BRASS HARDNESS IS COMPLICATED BY THE SENSITIVITY OF BRASS TO WORK HARDENING. HOWEVER, HARDNESS WILL BE EVALUATED WITH A COMBINATION OF EDDY CURRENT SENSORS AND HIGHSPEED INDENTATION HARDNESS SENSING SUCH AS ROCKWELL AND BRINNEL TECHNIQUES. EXPERIMENTAL TESTS WOULD BE COMPLETED THAT WOULD ESTABLISH AN EMPIRICAL BASIS FOR HARDNESS AND DIMENSIONAL SENSORS. A CONCEPTUAL SYSTEM DESIGN WILL THEN BE DEVELOPED IN WHICH THE MOST PROMISING SENSORS ARE INTEGRATED WITH A CUP HANDLING SYSTEM AND INTERCHANGEABLE TOOLING TO MEASURE 5.56MM THROUGH 50 CALIBER CUPS.

THE CONCEPT PROVIDES EFFECTIVE AIR-TO-GROUND ASSAULT CAPABILITY AGAINST GROUND VEHICLES, BUILDINGS, AND PERSONNEL WHEN FIRED FROM WING MOUNTED PODS ON FIGHTER AIRCRAFT. UNIQUE TO THE PROPOSED APPROACH IS THE SIMPLICITY OF ALLOWING A WEAPON MIX TO BE EMPLOYED ON A SINGLE AIR VEHICLE TO ENHANCE THE STRIKE CAPABILITY AGAINST UNEXPECTED TARGETS THAT MAY BE ENCOUNTERED. THE CONCEPT WILL ALSO PROVIDE AIR-TOAIR DEFENSE AGAINST ENEMY FIXED WING AND ROTARY AIRCRAFT. DUE TO ITS SIMPLE NATURE THE SYSTEM WOULD BE INEXPENSIVE, TAMPERPROOF, AND IMMUNE TO EW COUNTERMEASURES.

THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE FACIAL EXPRESSIONS AND EMOTIONS OF 40 NORMAL MOTHERS WHEN THEY DELIBERATELY MAKE FACIAL MOVEMENTS, WHEN THEY SEE AND HEAR STIMULI RELATED TO CHILDREN AND CHILD ABUSE, AND WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT THEIR REACTIONS. MOTHERS' POTENTIAL FOR CHILD ABUSE IS ASSESSED WITH A PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED INVENTORY; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS ARE VIDEOTAPED AND RECORDED ELECTROMYOGRAPHIC- ALLY, AND HEART RATE AND SKIN CONDUCTANCE IS MONITORED. THE TWO METHODS FOR MEASURING FACIAL EXPRESSIONS, A VISUAL TECHNIQUE AND EMG, ARE COMPARED TO SHOW THE CORRESPONDENCE OF INTENSITY AND ASYMMETRY MEASUREMENTS. THE ABILITY OF EMGTO DISCRIMINATE SPECIFIC MUSCULAR ACTIONS IS EXPLORED, AND THE POSSIBILITY THAT MUSCULAR TENSION CAN INCREASE WITHOUT VISIBLE CHANGES IS EXAMINED. AROUSAL AS MEASURED BY HEART RATE AND SKIN CONDUCTANCE WILL BE RELATED TO DETERMINE WHETHER DIFFERENT EMOTIONS DEPEND UPON ABUSE POTENTIAL SCORES.

UNFORTUNATELY, PREDICTABLE PHARMACOLOGIC MEANS FOR LONG-TERM WEIGHT REDUCTION ARE STILLLACKING DESPITE A LARGE NUMBER OF AVAILABLE DRUGS. SUCH DRUGS, PRIMARILY OF THE AMPHETAMINE CLASS, HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO PROVIDE ONLY MODEST WEIGHT REDUCTION OVER THE SHORT TERM.IN ADDITION, THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IS MITIGATED BY REBOUND EATING, ABUSE, AND ADDICTION. THE NEUROPHARMACOLOGY OF APPETITE AND SATIETY ARE JUST BEGINNING TO BE UNDERSTOOD AT THE MOLECULAR LEVEL, AND THE NUMBER OF POTENTIAL PHARMACO- LOGIC MEANS TO ALTER FEEDING BEHAVIOR HAS INCREASED ACCORD- INGLY. ENHANCEMENT OF APPETITE BY NEWLY DISCOVERED NEURO- PEPTIDES, FOR EXAMPLE, MUST AWAIT THE DISCOVERY OF BIOAVAILABLE NONPEPTIDE AGENTS. OF SEVERAL CENTRAL MECHANISMS FOR CONTROLLING APPETITE AND FEEDING, THERE IS CONSIDERABLE EVIDENCE THAT THE OPIOID SYSTEM PLAYS A MAJOR ROLE. THE EXPANDING BODY OF PHARMACOLOGICAL DATA PERTAININGTO OPIATES SUGGESTS A CLEAR NOVEL APPROACH TO A SAFE APPETITE SUPPRESSANT. SEVERAL EXISTING OPIATE ANTAGONISTS INHIBIT FEEDING, ALTHOUGH THE AVAILABLE ONES MAY PRODUCE ANYCOMBINATION OF SHORT ACTION, TOLERANCE, OR DYSPHORIA. HOWEVER, AS INDIVIDUAL ANTAGONISTS HAVE ONE OR ANOTHER USEFUL PROPERTY, THE DESIGN OF OPIATE ANTAGONISTS WITH SUPERIOR CHARACTERISTICS SHOULD BE POSSIBLE.

PLAYS A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN ADVANCED VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS FOR ANY POSTULATED AIRCRAFT. HENCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN EFFICIENT AND VERSATILE NUMERICAL ALGORITHM FOR SOLVING THIS TYPE OF COMPLEX EM SCATTERING PROBLEMS IS DEFINITELY IN DIRE NEED. IT IS PROPOSED TO ACHIEVE THIS BY USING A SPECIAL FINITE DIFFERENCE METHOD BASED UPON A NATURAL SPATIAL DISCRETIZATION OF THE INTEGRAL FORM OF MAXWELL'S EQUATIONS ON A NON-ORTHOGONAL GRID-SYSTEM AND THE LEAD-FROG FINITE DIFFERENCING IN THE TIME DOMAIN. IT HAS THE ADVANTAGES OF BEING (A) MORE EFFICIENT THAN ANY OTHER KNOWN NUMERICAL METHODS, (B) HIGHLY ACCURATE DUE TO THE BODY-FITTED GRID-SYSTEM, AND (C) THE EASIEST NUMERICAL METHODS TO IMPLEMENT ANY BOUNDARY CONDITIONS. IF THERE IS A NEED, FAST FOURIER TRANSFORM OF THE CORRESPONDING RESULTS IN THE TIME DOMAIN. THE PHASE I EFFORTS ARE TO DEVELOP THE ABOVE-MENTIONED EFFICIENT NUMERICAL ALGORITHM FOR SOLVING TWO-DIMENSIONAL SCATTERING PROBLEMS AND TO DEMONSTRATE ITS CAPABILITY BY SOLVING MANY REALISTIC EXAMPLES.",

A SYSTEM WILL BE DEVELOPED TO UTILIZE DATA FROM MANY SOURCES IN MANY ENVIRONMENTS, SO THAT THE ACCUMULATION OF DATA FOR PROSPECTIVE CLINICAL TRIALS CAN BE COMPUTERIZED WITHOUT DUPLICATING EXISTING COMPUTERIZED RECORD-KEEPING SYSTEMS. THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY DEFINING AN INTER- MEDIATE DATA DESCRIPTION FORMAT AND A SET OF TRANSFORMATION TOOLS THAT CONVERT BETWEEN THE VARIOUS COMPUTER APPLICATIONSAND THE STANDARD FORMAT. THIS TECHNIQUE HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED IN THE BUSINESS WORLD FOR INTERCHANGE OF DATA BETWEEN SPREADSHEETS AND OTHER BUSINESS SOFTWARE TOOLS. A SIMILAR TECHNIQUE WILL PROVIDE A MUCH-NEEDED CAPABILITY TO FLEXIBLY HANDLE CLINICAL CANCER DATA AS WELL.

IT IS PROPOSED TO INVESTIGATE A NEW CONCAPT FOR A HIGH EFFICIENCY IMAGING PROTOTYPE LASER BEAM WRITER AND DEVELOP A LABORATORY PROTOTYPE TO DEMONSTRATE ITS FEASIBILITY. THE HEART OF THE PROPOSED LASER BEAM WRITER IS A HIGH-RESOLUTION, HIGHOPTICAL-EFFICIENCY NYBRID SPATIAL LIGHT MODULATOR CALLED THE ELECTROSTATIC PRECIPITATING LIGHT MODULATOR (EPLM) THAT CAN BE ELECTRONICALLY OR OPTICALLY PROGRAMMED WITH MASK PATTERNS. BY READING OUT THE DEVICE WITH EXPANDED AND COLLIMATED UV LASER RADIATION, AN IMAGE OF THE DESIRED MASK PATTERN CAN BE PROJECTED ONTO THE SURFACE OF THE MATERIAL TO BE PROCESSED. THE PROPOSED FINAL VERSION OF THE LASER BEAM WRITER WILL EMPLOY A MODULATOR WITH AN ACTIVE AREA (SQUARE) OF 100MM X 100MM, A SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF ABOUT 33 LINES/MM, AND A FULLFRAME WRITE TIME OF ABOUT ONE SECOND. THUS BY DEMAGNIFYING THE MODULATOR IMAGE WITH HIGH QUALITY IMAGING OPTICS, MASKS WITH SPATIAL RESOLUTION IN EXCESS OF 200 LINES/MM CAN BE PRODUCED QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY. THE SYSTEM IS ALSO CAPABLE OF MODIFYING AND COPYING EXISTING LITHOGRAPHIC MASKS BY IMAGING THSES MASKS ONTO THE OPTICAL THE OPTICAL INPUT PORT OF THE SPATIAL LIGHT MODULATOR.",

FUTURE GENERATIONS OF HIGH ENERGY LINEAR COLLIDERS MAY REQUIRE HIGH POWER COHERENT RADIATION SOURCES WITH WAVELENGTHS OF THREE CENTIMETERS AND LOWER. ONE POSSIBLE GENERATOR OF TUNABLE COHERENT RADIATION IN THESE WAVELENGTHS IS THE FREE ELECTRON LASER (FEL). INTEREST IN THE INTERMEDIATE ENERGY ELECTRON COOLING OF ANTIPROTON SOURCES HAS ENABLED THE NATIONAL ELECTROSTATICS CORPORATION (NEC) TO BEGIN DEVELOPMENT OF A 4 AMPERE, 3 MEV RECIRCULATING ELECTRON BEAM SYSTEM APPROPRIATE FOR DC FEL OPERATION. THE ADVANTAGES OF THIS SYSTEM ARE HIGH BEAM QUALITY, HIGH AVERAGE POWER, AND HIGH EFFICIENCY. THIS SYSTEM, WITH A MODIFICATION TO ALLOW A 50 KEV ENERGY LOSS INTHE RECIRCULATING BEAM, COULD PUMP A WAVEGUIDE CONTINUOUSLY AT 200 KW. BY USING MIRRORS TO FORM AN OPTICAL CAVITY, ENERGY CAN BE STORED. USING Q SWITCHING TECHNIQUES THIS ENERGY CAN BE PULSED OUT OF THE CAVITY QUICKLY, RESULTING INVERY HIGH PEAK POWER. ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING TYPES OF NEW ACCELERATOR IS THE PLASMA BEATWAVE ACCELERATOR. A TWO FREQUENCY FEL MIGHT PROVIDE THE LASER DRIVER FOR SUCH AN ACCELERATOR POTENTIALLY YIELDING ACCELERATING GRADIENTS IN EXCESS OF 1 GEV PER METER. THE CONTRACTOR PROPOSES TO DESIGN AND TEST A MULTISTAGE ELECTRON BEAM COLLECTOR CAPABLE OF COLLECTING A WIDE RANGE OF ELECTRON ENERGIES. SUCCESSFUL OPERATION OF THE DEVICE WILL PROVE THE FEASIBILITY OF A TWO FREQUENCY FEL POWER SOURCE FOR FUTURE ACCELERATION TECHNIQUES.",

A NOVEL DESIGN FOR AN OPTOTACTILE TRANSDUCER WILL BE DEVELOPED. THE TRANSDUCER HAS THE POTEN-TIAL FOR BEING VERY COMPACT, HAVING A WIDE RANGE OF MODULA- TION CAPABILITIES, BEING HIGHLY RELIABLE, AND HAVING MODEST POWER CONSUMPTION. PHASE I OF THIS PROJECT WILL ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING SUCH A TRANSDUCER BY BUILDING AND EVALUATING A DESK-TOP, LABORATORY VERSION OF THE TRANSDUCER.IF PROVEN FEASIBILE, A PORTABLE, MULTIPOINT TRANSDUCER WILL BE BUILT AND TESTED DURING PHASE II.",

THIS WOULD HAVE ENHANCED INTERFACIAL ADHESION BY IMPROVING SECONDARY BONDING MECHANISMS. THE CURRENT APPROACH TO MEASURING SURFACE ENERGETICS IS INADEQUATE TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE. SINCE THERMOPLASTICS DO NOT UNDERGO EXCHANGE REACTIONS, IMPROVED INTERFACIAL ADHESION WILL BE DEPENDENT UPON IMPROVEMENTS IN SURFACE ENERGETICS COMPATIBILITY. SURFACE CHEMISTRY MODIFICATION THROUGH PLASMA TREATMENT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO TAILOR THE SURFACE ENERGETICS OF REINFORCING FIBERS TO SURFACE ENERGY CHARACTERISTICS OF THERMOPLASTIC RESINS. TO EXPLOIT THIS POTENTIAL, AN IMPROVED METHOD OF DETERMINING SURFACE ENERGY COMPONENTS IS REQUIRED. THE WILHEMY TECHNIQUE WILL BE APPLIED TO FIBER AND RESIN SURFACE ENERGY MEASUREMENTS, EMPLOYING AN EXPANDED SUITE OF PROBE LIQUIDS, DIVIDED INTO THREE SURFACE ENERGY CLSSIFICATIONS.

THE RESULTING INCREASED RISK OF ENEMY DETECTION FROM DIRECT-INJECTION MILITARY DIESELS PLACES A HIGH VALUE ON METHODS OF REDUCING THE COMBUSTION NOISE. WILLIAM C. PFEFFERLE ASSOCIATES (WCP) HAS INVENTED A PROPRIETARY CATALYTICALLY-ENHANCED MODIFICATION OF A DIESEL ENGINE WHICH OFFERS A NUMBER OF PROMISING FEATURES, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANTLY-REDUCED COMBUSTION NOISE LEVELS. USING CATALYSTS PLACED PERMANENTLY IN THE COMBUSTION CHAMBER OF A DIESEL ENGINE, WCP HAS DEMONSTRATED RAPID CONSTANT-VOLUME COMBUSTION OF DIESEL FUEL ACCOMPANIED BY A NOTICEABLY-LOWER NOISE LEVEL (CONFIRMED BY A PRESSURETRACE WITHOUT HIGH FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS) AND A COMBUSTION CHAMBER FREE OF VISIBLE SOOT.

MODELS OF AVERAGE NUCLEAR PRODUCED BACKGROUNDS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FROM THEORETICAL MODELS OF VOLUME EMISSION AND RADIANCE CALCULATIONS WHICH INCLUDE OPTICAL RADIATION TRANSPORT EFFECTS. THE EFFECT OF OPTICAL STRUCTURE IS MODELED THROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF PARAMETERS DESCRIBING THE STRUCTURE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY (PSD). HOWEVER, ALL PSD CHARACTERISTICS HAVE BEEN OBTAINED FROM PHOTOGRAPHS IN VISIBLE WAVELENGTHS. THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODELS RELATING OBSERVED STRUCTURE PARAMETERS IN VISIBLE WAVELENGTHS TO NON-VISIBLE WAVELENGTHS IS OF HIGH IMPORTANCE. ALSO OF HIGH INTEREST FOR POSSIBLE DISCRIMINATION ALGORITHMS IS BAND-TO-BAND CORRELATION OF NON-VISIBLE WAVELENGTH EMISSIONS; MODEL OF SUCH CORRELATIONS ARE NEEDED FOR GENERAL BURST ALTITUDE/YIELD COMBINATIONS. SUCH MODELS CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO DNA/RAAE COMPUTER CODE SIMULATIONS OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS EFFECTS.",

THE DIAGNOSTIC UTILIZES THE TECHNIQUE OF OPTICAL-INFRARED DOUBLE RESONANCE TO OBSERVE BEAM INTENSITIES. IN THIS TECHNIQUE, THE OUTPUT OF A MWIR CHEMICAL LASER (DF) IS COMBINED WITH THE OUTPUT OF A VISIBLE/UV PROBE LASER TO PRODUCE OR MODULATE THE FLUORESCENCE OF A SIMPLE DIATOMIC MOLECULE SEEDED IN A GAS FLOW THROUGH WHICH THE LASER PROPAGATES. THE INTENSITY OF THE FLUORESCENCE IS LINEARLY PROPORTIONAL TO EACH OF THE LASER INTENSITIES. THE OVERLAP OF THE IR AND PROBE BEAMS DEFINES A CROSS SECTION OF THE IR BEAM, WHICH IS IMAGED ON TO A TWO-DIMENSIONAL INTENSIFIED ARRAY WITH 1 PERCENT SPATIAL RESOLUTION. TEMPORAL RESOLUTION IS DETERMINED BY THE LENGTH OF THE PROBE LASER PULSE (15 NS).AN ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE LAMINAR FLOW JET WILL SEED THE MOLECULE TO BE EXCITED INTO THE GAS STREAM. PHASE I RESEARCH WILL SELECT FROM MANY POSSIBLE IMAGING MOLECULES AND PERFORM EXCITATION AND QUENCHING MEASUREMENTS TO DETERMINE OPTIMUM CANDIDATES. A RAMAN-SHIFTED PULSED DYE LASER WILL BE USED TO SIMULATE THE PEAK POWER OUTPUT OF A CW DF CHEMICAL LASER. A SECOND DYE LASER WILL BE USED AS THE PROBE LASER.

THIS IS CLEARLY AN IMPORTANT PROBLEM FOR ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT UNDER RADIATION BOMBARDMENT IN CASE OF NUCLEAR ATTACK, IN THE SPACE PROGRAM, AND IN NUCLEAR POWER IN STALLATIONS, WHETHER FIXED POWER OR MOBILE (SHIP) POWER PLANTS. THE PRESENT PROPOSER FOUND THAT AFTER THIS INITIAL RESISTIVITY DROP, FURTHER IRRADIATION CAUSED A MARKED RISE IN RESISTIVITY OF MANY DIELECTRICS. WHEN REMOVED FROM RADIATION, THE RESISTANCE RETURNED TO ITS PRE-IRRADIATED VALUE. THIS EFFECT ON THE INDUCED RESISTIVITY SUGGESTS THE POSSIBILITY OF PRE-IRRADIATING DIELECTRICS TO THE POINT WHERE THEY PASS THE RESISTIVITY LOW POINT AND HAVE CLIMBED UP THE RISING SIDE OF THE RESISTIVITY-RADIATION CURVE. WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE THIS RADIATION HARDENING EFFECT OF DIELECTRICS IN ELECTRONIC COMPONENTYS ALONG WITH CHEMICAL ADDITIVIES IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE MOBILITY OR LIFE TIME OF THE CHARGE CARRIERS INDUCED BY THE RADIATION.",

THE HYPOTHESIS WAS PUT FOURTH BY FITZGERALD (1968) THAT THIS REMARKABLE BOUNDARY LAYER CONTROL IS ASSOCIATED WIWITH THE COMPLEX DYNAMIC MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THE D DOLPHIN'S THICK (1\") COMPLIANT BLUBBER (NTO THE THIN DOLPHINSKIN, RE KRAMER (1960). THE SURFACE OF THE COMPLAINT M MATERIAL WILL BE DEFORMED BY THE FLUCTUATING SURFACE FORCES OF THE TURBULENT BOUNDARY LAYER (TBL) IN SOME STATISTICAL FASHION DETERMINED BY THE SCALE AND INTENSITY OF THE T TURBULENCE. SINCE THE COMPLIANT MATERIAL IS VISCOELASTIC, THIS FLUCTUATING DEFORMATION MUST RESULT IN SOME ABSORPT ION OF ENERGY FROM THE TURBULENT FIELD, THUS REDUCING THE INTENSITY OF TURBULENCE (OR DELAYING ITS ONSET). IN TERMS OF CIRCUIT ANALOGIES, THE COMPLIANT VISCOELASTIC MATERIAL REPRESENTS A \"LOAD\" ON THE TBL \"GENERATOR\".

THESE PROGRAMS SUPPORT THE SEARCH FORPARASITE ANTIGENS THAT COULD STIMULATE PROTECTIVE IMMUNITY IN HUMANS VIA ANTIBODY-DEPENDENT MECHANISMS. HOWEVER, THE ACQUIRED PROTECTIVE IMMUNITY TO MALARIA FOUND IN HUMANS LIVING IN MALARIOUS AREAS IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD. NEVERTHELESS IT IS LIKELY THAT VACCINES BASED ON ANTIBODY ALONE WILL CONTRIBUTE A GREAT DEAL TO THE CONTROL OF MALARIA. NATURALLY ACQUIRED IMMUNITY TO FALCIPARUM MALARIA IN SUDAN INVOLVES A MAJOR CONTRIBUTION FROM CELL-MEDIATED IMMUNE RESPONSES. IN VITRO, SUDANESE IMMUNE SERA CAUSE A PROFOUND RETARDATION IN THE INTRAERYTHROCYTIC DEVELOPMENT OFP. FALCIPARUM RESULTING IN THE APPEARANCE OF MORPHOLOGICALLYTYPICAL \"CRISIS FORMS\" (CFF). THE LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES OF THIS RESEARCH ARE TO PRODUCE CFF FOR USE AS A THERAPEUTIC AGENT IN THE CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF MALARIA OR TO STIMULATE PRODUCTION OF A PROTECTIVE SUBSTANCE IN VIVO AS A POTENTIAL PROPHYLAXIS.

RESEARCH SPONSORED PARTLY BY DNA HAS RECENTLY INDICATED THAT IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO FORM POWERFUL ELECTRICAL ARCS WITHIN HARD ROCK. THIS WOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED BY PLACING TWO ELECTRODES, SPACED UP TO SEVERAL FEET APART, AGAINST THE ROCK SURFACE AND PULSING THEM WITH HIGH VOLTAGE. A HIGH CURRENT ARC DISCHARGE IS EXPECTED TO FORM MANY INCHES BELOW THE SURFCE. THE DEPOSITION OF ARC ENERGY WOULD BE EQUIVALENT TO DETONATING HIGH EXPLOSIVE WITHIN THE ROCK, THEREBY REMOVING THE SURFACE LAYER. BY MOVING THE ELECTRODES FROM PLACE TO PLACE ON THE TUNNEL FACE AND REPETITIVELY PULSING THEM, RAPID MATERIAL REMOVAL RATES SHOUD BE ACHIEVABLE. PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES INDICATE THAT TUNNELING RATES OF 1,000 FEET PER DAY MAY BE POSSIBLE IN 20-FOOT DIAMETER TUNNELS WITH A 2 MEGAWATT SYSTEM COSTING LESS THAN $1 MILLION (EXCLUDING DEBRIS REMOVAL).

IN OUR PROPOSED PHASE I PROGRAM, WE WILL COLLABORATE WITH DARPA PERSONNEL TO DEFINE REPRESENTATIVE MODULE PARAMETERS. DATA PRESENTLY UNAVAILABLE ON FERRITE BREAKDOWN STRENGTH AND PERMITTIVITY WILL BE GATHERED EXPERIMENTALLY. VARIOUS TECHNIQUES FOR CONFIGURING FERRITE CORES TO ACHIEVE HIGH GRADIENT (RADIAL STACKING, CAPACITIVE GRADING, AND OTHERS) ARE PROPOSED, AND THESE WILL BE STUDIED IN DETAIL TO DETERMINE THEIR UTILITY. WE WILL ALSO MANUFACTURE AND TEST NI-FE CORES WITH ULTRA-THIN LAMINATIONS USING A PROPRIETARY TECHNIQUE.

NEAR-INFRARED LIGHT (800 NM TO 1200 NM) TRIGGERS TRAPPED ELECTRON RELEASE, RESULTING IN EMITTED VISIBLE LIGHT. SUCH OPERATION APPEARS IMPERVIOUS TO EMP, STRUCTURAL DAMAGE EFFECTS SEEM MINIMAL AND POSSIBLE TRANSIENT RADIATION EFFECTS ARE ALSO MINIMAL. IT IS PROPOSED TO FABRICATE ET OPTICAL MEMORY (ETOM) STRUCTURES WITH READ-WRITE-ERASE AS A VEHICLE TO EVALUATE THE RADIATION HARDNESS OF THESE MATERIALS FOR OPTICAL COMPUTERS. MEASUREMENTS OF DATA STATUS, RESPONSE MAGNITUDES, RESPONSE TIMES AND TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCES WILL BE MADE BEFORE AND AFTER RADIATION DOSES DESIGNED FOR TRANSIENT IONIZATION, DISPLACEMENT DAMAGE AND EMP EFFECTS. IN THIS WAY, THE HARDNESS OF THESE NEW ET PHOTONIC MATERIALS WILL BE ASSESSED FOR APPLICATIONS IN VARIOUSTHREAT ENVIRONMENTS.",

PROVIDED WITH A MULTIPLICITY OF HIGHLY REDUNDANT SENSOR READINGS, THE OPERATOR MUST ACTIVELYMONITOR AND DIRECT PLANT OPERATION UNDER A VARIETY OF CONDITION. THE PROPER INTERPRETATION OF THE SENSOR READINGSREQUIRES THAT THE OPERATOR HAVE A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF SUBSYSTEM RELATIONSHIP AND ASSOCIATED PHYSICAL LAWS. A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT SUBCOMPONENTS ARE CURRENTLY OUT OF OPERATION FOR MAINTENANCE IS OBVIOUSLY CRUCIAL, AND EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN COMPLETED CAN BE VALUABLE IN THE ASSESSMENT OF PLANT OPERATION. RECENT ADVANCES IN COMPUTER AND CONTROL ENGINEERING HAVE PROVIDED TOOLS THAT CAN BE APPLIED TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE PLANT OPERATOR MAN-MACHINE INTERFACE: CLEAR, GRAPHIC INPUT AND VALIDATED DATA PRESENTATION; INTELLIGENT NATURAL LANGUAGE (ENGLISH) INPUT AND OUTPUT COUPLED WITH VOICE SYNTHESIS SYSTEMS; AND INTELLIGENT ANALYSIS OF PLANT OPERATIONS ARE NOW FEASIBLE OBJECTIVES. FURTHERMORE, THE RESULTING INTERFACE CAN BE SUBJECTED TO MUCH MORE THOROUGH VALIDATION AND RELIABILITY TESTING THAN PREVIOUSLY POSSIBLE. THIS PROJECT COMPRISES A MULTITASK EFFORT TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT AN INTELLIGENT ADVANCED SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR NUCLEAR REACTOR CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE. THE GOAL WOULD BE TO CAPTURE AND AUGMENT THE EXPERTISE AND PERFORMANCE OF HUMAN NUCLEAR PLANT CONTROL OPERATORS. IN PHASE I, AN INVESTIGATION OF THE THEORETICAL FEASIBILITY OF SUCH A SYSTEM WILL BE CONDUCTED. PHASE II WILL DEVELOP, TEST, AND DEMONSTRATE THAT SUCH A SYSTEM MEETS THE NEEDS OF THE DOE FOR ENHANCING OPERATOR PERFORMANCE AND THERBY IMPROVING PLANT SAFETY AND EFFICIENCY.",

PILOT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT WITH THIS ASSISTANCE, CHILDREN CAN READ, WITHOUT FRUSTRATION, PASSAGESTHAT ARE SUBSTANTIALLY ABOVE THEIR INDEPENDENT READING LEVEL. ENHANCEMENTS WILL BE MADE TO THE SYSTEM AND TWO STUDIES WILL BE CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE WHAT LEVEL OF TEXT CAN BE ADEQUATELY READ WITH THIS ASSISTANCE. IN A THIRD STUDY, JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO READ POORLY WILL RECEIVE COMPUTER ASSISTANCE IN READING THEIR SOCIAL STUDIES MATERIALS, TO LEARN WHETHER THIS MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO READ THEIR ASSIGNMENTS WITHOUT ADDITIONAL HELP, AND TO THEN PARTICIPATE FULLY IN NORMAL CLASSES, IN SPITE OF THEIR READING DISABILITY. THE SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO HAVE WIDE APPLICABILITY IN ASSISTING READING-DISABLED CHILDREN TO DEALWITH THE READING REQUIREMENTS OF SCHOOLING WITHOUT DISCOURAGEMENT AND FRUSTRATION.",

IN THIS APPROACH DIELECTRIC ELECTRODES ARE EMPLOYED FOR THE MAIN DISCHARGE, AND A SURFACE DISCHARGE ALONG THE SURFACE OF A DIELECTRIC ELECTRODE PREIONIZES THE GAS VOLUME PRIOR TO THE PRIMARY DISCHARGE. THIS SURFACE DISCHARGE APPROACH ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR A SEPARATE PREIONIZATION SOURCE. A COMMON APPROACH CURRENTLY USED EMPLOYS A SPARKBOARD LOCATED WITHIN AND/OR BEHIND ONE OF THE PRIMARY ELECTRODES. THIS REQUIRES EITHER AN OPEN AREA OR PERFORATION OF A PRIMARY ELECTRODE AND SEPARATES THE ULTRAVIOLET PERIONIZATION SOURCE FROM THE LASER GAS VOLUME. THE PROPOSED APPROACH BOTH ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR OPEN SPACES IN A PRIMARY ELECTRODE, AND LOCATES THE PREIONIZATION SOURCE ADJACENT TO THE LASER VOLUME. IN ADDITION THE USE OF DIELECTRIC ELECTRODES INCREASES THE ARCING LIMITS OF THE PRIMARY DISCHARGE THEREBY ALLOWING LARGER DEPOSITION ENERGY PER UNIT VOLUME. THE SURFACE DISCHARGE PREIONIZATION APPROACH WILL BE EXPERIMENTALLY INVESTIGATED APPLYING THE SURFACE DISCHARGE TECHNOLOGY BASE DEVELOPED IN A WJSA LABORATORY, TO AN EXISTING SINGLE PULSE CARBON DIOXIDE LASER DESIGNED AND FABRICATED IN THE WJSA LABORATORY.",

DUE TO GAIN SATURATION AND WAVEFRONT ABERRATIONS. IN THE SAME SIZE PACKAGE AN ARRAY OF WAVEGUIDES COULD BE EXCITED POTENTIALLY PRODUCING AN M X N INCREASE IN THE TOTAL OUTPUT POWER AND, IF THEY WERE PHASE-LOCKED, POTENTIALLY ALMOST AN (MXN)2 INCREASE THE PEAK OF THE FAR-FIELD IRRADIANCE DISTRIBUTION. WJSA HAS FABRICATED 1X7 AND 2X3 ARRAY DEVICES USING DC LONGITUDINAL EXCITATION. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE PHASE-LOCKING BETWEEN ADJACENT LASERS, A TRANSPARENT WINDOW OF ZNSE SEPARATES THE WAVEGUIDES. BECAUSE THESE WINDOWS ARE OPTICALLY FLAT, THEY ARE FABRICATED IN SMALL SIZES THUS LEAVING TINY GAPS BETWEEN WAVEGUIDES. THIS RESULTS IN CONSIDERABLE DISCHARGE CROSS TALK AND CONSIDERABLY REDUCED LASER POWER WITH PLASMA OSCILLATIONS. WJSA PROPOSES TO CONVERT THESE EXISTING WAVEGUIDE LASER ARRAYS TO TRANSVERSE RF EXCITATION USING AN EXISTING RF SUPPLY. TRANSVERSE RF EXCITATION WILL ALLOW OPTIMUM GAS POWER LOADING OVER THE ENTIRE WAVEGUIDE LENGTH AND CONSIDERABLY REDUCE THE WAVEGUIDE DISCHARGE CROSSTALK. THE OUTPUT POWERS OF THE INDIVIDUAL WAVEGUIDES SHOULD REMAIN STEADY INSTEAD OF OSCILLATING WILDLY OR EXTINGUISHING WHEN MORE THAN ONE DISCHARGE IS RUN. THE OUTPUT POWER UNIFORMITY OF BOTH ARRAYS WILL BE MEASURED AND THE FARFIELD PATTERNS WILL BE EXAMINED FOR PHASE-LOCKING AND ARRAY MODE FORMATION.",

THE PROPOSED DESIGN USES A GAAS LASER DIODE WHICH IS CAPABLE OF VERY SHORT OPTICAL PULSES AT A PULSE RATE SO THAT THE POWER CONSUMPTION IS LOW. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM IS SCANNED IN ONE AXIS SO THAT THE SPACE IN FRONT OF THE ROBOT IS SAMPLED AT MANY DIFFERENT BEARING ANGLES. THE SYSTEM COULD EASILY BE EXPANDED IN THE FUTURE TO SCAN IN BOTH THE AXIMUTH AND ELEVATION. THE VERY NARROW BEAM AND NARROW PULSEWIDTH OF THE LASER RANGER WILL PROVIDE GOOD OBSTACLE DEFINITION. THE PROPOSED RANGER USES A SIMPLE ANALOG TECHNIQUE FOR MEASURING RANGE WHICH YIELDS HIGH ACCURACY AND ELIMINATES THE ULTRA HIGH FREQUENCY DIGITAL COUNTERS AND CIRCUITRY WHICH ARE COMPLEX AND CONSUMES MORE POWER. THE USE OF OPTICAL FIBER DELAY LINES WILL ALLOW THE SYSTEM TO MEASURE TO ZERO RANGE AND ELIMINATE THE ELECTRICAL INTERFERENCE BETWEEN THE TRANSMITTER MAIN BANG AND THE SENSITIVE OPTICAL RECEIVER.",

INTERTIDAL ZONES ARE THE LEAST STUDIED OF MARINE HABITATS IN THIS RESPECT, ALTHOUGH THESE DYNAMIC AND STRESSFUL ENVIRONMENTS MAY PROMOTE THE PRODUCTION OF SECONDARY METABOLITES WITH PHARMACOLOGIC ACTIVITY. SEAPHARMPROPOSES TO COLLECT AND EVALUATE FOR ANTITUMOR ACTIVITY 200 TO 400 MARINE ORGANISMS OVER A WIDE RANGE OF SPECIES FROM THREE DIVERSE INTERTIDAL ZONES; ROCK SHORES, SAND BEACHES, AND MUD FLATS. RESEARCHERS WILL ALSO EVALUATE SAMPLES FROM MANGROVE SWAMPS, AS PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THIS TO BEA PRODUCTIVE AREA. THE PROPOSED PROGRAM WILL EVALUATE A LARGE NUMBER OF ORGANISMS FROM DIVERSE INTERTIDAL ENVIRONMENTS TO DETERMINE THE POTENTIAL OF THESE AREAS AND SPECIES TYPES FOR PRODUCING NOVEL ANTICANCER AGENTS AND TO PROVIDE A BASIS FOR FURTHER STUDIES. EXTRACTS WILL BE TESTED FOR IN VITRO ANTITUMOR ACTIVITY AGAINST THE P388 MURINE LEUKEMIA AND THREE HUMAN CELL LINES, AND CELL EXTRACTS WILL BE SUBMITTED FOR TESTING IN HUMAN TUMOR CELL LINES. CHEMICAL ISOLATION, PURIFICATION, AND STRUCTURE ELUCIDATION WILL BE INITIATED FOR THE MOST PROMISING AGENTS.PHASE II STUDIES MAY INCLUDE IN VIVO STUDIES OF PROMISING AGENTS, INCREASED COLLECTIONS IN THE FLORIDA KEYS AREA, AND EXPANSION OF INTERTIDAL COLLECTIONS TO OTHER REGIONS SUCH ASWARM AND COLD TEMPERATE ZONES AND THE TROPICAL INDO-PACIFIC REGION.",

PLASMA HEATING IS ACCOMPLISHED BY A DC DISCHARGE BETWEEN THE TWO ANODES LOCATED INSIDE THE MAGNETIC NOZZLE COILS AND A DOWNSTREAM HOLLOW CATHODE WHICH IS LOCATED ON A MAGNETIC FIELD LINE THAT PASSES NEAR THE CENTER LINE OF THE ANODES. MOST OF THE PROPELLANT IS INJECTED INTO THE DISCHARGE THROUGH THE ANODES. THIS THRUSTER CONCEPT BUILDS DIRECTLY ON BOTH THE BEST OF THE MAGNETOPLASMADYNAMIC (MPD) THRUSTER AND EXISTING STELLARATOR TECHNOLOGY. PRIOR WORK HAS SHOWN THAT THIS TYPE THRUSTER HAS THE POTENTIAL OF ACHIEVING THRUST EFFICIENCIES APPROACHING 80% IN THE SPECIFIC IMPULSE RANGE OF 20003000 SECONDS, I.E. 50-100% HIGHER EFFICIENCY THAN ANY EXISTING PLASMA THRUSTERS.

THE MAJOR GOAL OF THIS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IS TO DESIGN AND PRODUCE A CARBON/PROTON DOUBLY TUNED VARIABLE TEMPERATURE PROBE WITH SEVERAL ADVANCED FEATURES FOR SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS TOWARD SAMPLES SUCH AS PIGMENT GALLSTONES. THE PROBE WILL HANDLE LARGER SAMPLES WITH FEWER TANK CIRCUIT LOSSES, YIELDING MORE SENSITIVITY AT 2.3 TESLA (100 MHZ PROTON) FIELD STRENGTHS. IT WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO HANDLE LARGER PROTON POWERS FOR COMPLETE DECOUPLING OF SAMPLES CONTAINING BROADENED ANISOTROPIC CARBON-13 CHEMICAL SHIFTS-A PROBLEM OFTEN FOUND WITH BIOMEDICAL SAMPLES. THE VARIABLE TEMPERATURE CAPABILITY WILL ALLOW HIGHLY AMORPHOUS SAMPLES TO BE COOLED AND STUDIED UNDER MORECRYSTALLINE AND MORE SPECTROSCOPICALLY INFORMATIVE CONDITIONS. NMR INSTRUMENTS WITH MAGNETIC FIELDS OF 4.6 TESLA AND HIGHER REQUIRE SAMPLE SPINNING RATES OF NEAR 8 KHZAND HIGHER. THIS PROJECT WILL THUS AIM AT BUILDING A PROBE HEAD SIMILAR TO THAT DESCRIBED ABOVE THAT WILL SPIN OPTIMUM SIZED SAMPLES AT 8 KHZ.",

CHAMUEI = I9S4) CAPABLE OF DETERMINING IN REAL TIME THE PRESENCE, LOCATION, NUMBER, AND SIZE OF DEFECTS PRESENT ALONG A LINEAR PATH ON THE SURFACE OF A CONDUCTIVE MATERIAL UNDER TEST PIPES, TUBES, PLATES) WITH A CONTACTLESS SENSOR. THE SENSOR CONSISTS OF A MAGNETOSTRICTIVE DELAY LINE PLACED IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE SURFACE TO BE INSPECTED. A CURRENT CARRYING WIRE PLACED ADJACENT AND PARALLEL TO THE DELAY LINE IS USED TO INDUCE EDDY CURRENTS IN THE MATERIAL. THE PRESENCE OF A FLAW IN THE MATERIAL CREATES TRANSVERSE EDDY CURRENTS. THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD OF THE TRANSVERSE EDDY CURRENT COMPONENTS INTERACTS LOCALLYWITH THE MAGNETOSTRICTIVE DELAY LINE LAUNCHING ULTRASONIC WAVES IN THE DELAY LINE. PULSED ULTRASONIC WAVES ARE GENERATED BY USING PULSED ELECTRICAL CURRENTS IN THE CURRENT CARRYING WIRE. THE ULTRASONIC WAVES ORIGINATE AT THE FLAW EDGES LOCATIONS ALONG THE DELAY LINE. SRATIAL INFORMATION REGARDING FLAW EDGE LOCATIONS IS PRESERVED IN THE TIME INFORMATION OF THE ULTRASONIC WAVES PROPAGATING IN THE DELAY LINE. AN ULTRASONIC RECEIVER COUPLED TO THE DELAY LINE IS USED TO DETECT THE TRAVELING WAVES. THE NUMBER OF ULTRASONIC PULSES INCREASES AS THE NUMBER OF FLAWS INCREASES. THE CONTACTLESS PROBE IS NOT SUCCEPTIBLE TO THE PRESENCE OF MECHANICAL VIBRATION NOISE IN THE MATERIAL AND CAN OPERATE AT HIGH TEMPERATURES. THE PROBE WHEN FORMED IN A CIRCULAR OR HELICAL PATH AROUND A PIPE WOULD AUTOMATICALLYSELF-SCAN THE PATH AND PROVIDE INFORMATION REGARDING THE PRESENCE, LOCATION, NUMBET, AND SIZE OF CRACKS. THE LOCATION OF A CRACK IS DETERMINED FROM THE TIME OF ARRIVAL OF THE CORRESPONDING ULTRASONIC PULSE IN THE DELAY LINE. THE CONCEPT IS POWERFUL AND UNIQUE SINCE IT COMBINES THE ADVANTAGES OF ULTRASONIC, EDDY CURRENT, AND ELECTROMAGNETIC NDE TECHNIQUES. THE OBJECTIVE OF PHASE I IS TO ASSESS THE APPLICATION OF THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUE TO HIGH-SPEED RELIABLEINSPECTION OF HOT PIPES AND COMPONENTS WITHOUT COUPLANTS.",

EVIDENCE IS CLEAR THAT LEVELS OF THE VARIOUS TYPES OF LIPOPROTEINS (HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (HDL), LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (LDL), INTERMEDIATE DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (IDL), AND VERY LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (VLDL)) HAVE CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE ON AN INDIVIDUAL'S CHANCES OF DEVELOPING ATHEROSCLEROSIS. CERTAIN LIPOPROTEINS, PARTICU- LARLY LDL, HAVE AN UNFAVORABLE INFLUENCE, WHEREAS CERTAIN OTHERS, PARTICULARLY HDL, HAVE A FAVORABLE INFLUENCE. ONE OF THE GOALS OF DRUG PREVENTION OF ATHEROSCLEROSIS IS TO LOWER LDL WHILE RAISING HDL. WHILE LDL CAN BE LOWERED SIGNIFICANTLY BY A NUMBER OF DRUGS, HDL HAS GENERALLY PROVEDREFRACTORY TO DRUG THERAPY AND IN MANY INSTANCES ACTUALLY INCREASES. IT IS THOUGHT THAT LDL SERVES TO DELIVER CHOLESTEROL TO CELLS OF THE BODY, SUCH AS ARTERY WALL CELLS WHERE BUILDUP OF CHOLESTEROL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ATHERO- SCLEROSIS, AND THAT HDL SERVES TO REMOVE CHOLESTEROL FROM CELLS IN A PROCESS CALLED REVERSE CHOLESTEROL TRANSPORT. THE PROTECTIVE EFFECT OF HDL AND ITS REVERSE CHOLESTEROL TRANSPORT ACTIVITY APPEAR TO BE TIED TO THE LEVEL OF LCAT ACTIVATION OF APOLIPOPROTEIN A-I IN HDL. SOUTHERN BIOTECH- NOLOGY ASSOCIATES PROPOSES THAT SYNTHETIC ANALOGS OF THE AMPHIPATHIC PEPTIDES CAN BE USED TO INCREASE REVERSE CHOLESTEROL TRANSPORT BY RAISING OR SUPPLEMENTING HDL VIA PEPTIDE INJECTION INTO THE BLOOD STREAM.

THIS COULD RESULT IN WASTED MANPOWER AND EXCESSIVE AIRCRAFT DOWN TIME. THE PROPOSED INSTRUMENT IS DESIGNED TO FULFILL THE REQUIREMENT FOR A FUEL LEAK CHARACTERIZATION DEVICE THAT CAN DETERMINE THE LOCATION AND SIZE OF A LEAK WITHOUT HAVING TO REMOVE EQUIPMENT FROM A BAY. THIS DEVICE WORKS ON THE PRINCIPLE OF MEASURING THE VISIBLE FLUORESCENT EMISSION INTENSITY FROM A FUEL LEAK SPOT WHICH HAS BEEN ILLUMINATED BY ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT. THE UV LIGHT IS CARRIED INTO, AND THE FLUORESCENCE CARRIED OUT OF, THE BAY BY A FIBER OPTIC PROBE, WHICH ALSO INCLUDES A FIBERSCOPE FOR VISUALLY LOCATING THE LEAK.

THIS NOT ONLY IMPROVES SAFETY, BUT IT ALSO REDUCES MANPOWER, EQUIPMENT, AND CHEMICAL COSTS BY OPTIMIZING THE TIMING AND METHOD OF TREATMENT. WE PROPOSE A NOVEL SCHEME FOR MEASURING ROADWAY SURFACE CONDITIONS USING A COMPACT, PORTABLE SYSTEM WHICH COULD BE MOUNTED ON A CAR OR TRUCK. IT WOULD PROVIDE A CONTINUOUS READOUT OF PAVEMENT CONDITIONS AS THE VEHICLE DRIVES ALONG A ROADWAY OR RUNWAY. THE SYSTEM USES RAMAN SCATTERING OF LIGHT BY THE SURFACE CONSTITUENTS TO DETERMINE THE PRESENCE OF WATER, ICE, AND CHEMICALS ON THE PAVEMENT. IT HAS ALREADY BEEN DEMONSTRATED THAT RAMA SCATTERING CAN BE USED TO DETECT AND DISTINGUISH WATER AND ICE. OUR PHASE I OBJECTIVE IS TO DEMONSTRATE FEASIBILITY UNDER REALISTIC CONDITIONS. THE RAMA SCATTERING SPECTRUM OF WATER AND ICE IN THE PRESENCE OF PAVEMENT AND DEICING CHEMICALS WILL BE MEASURED.

THE SOFTWARE WILL INTERACT WITH THE USER IN THE PROCESS OF FORM DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT.DURING THIS INTERACTION THE PROGRAM WILL ASSIMILATE THE INFORMATION NEEDED TO DEVELOP A DATA ENTRY PACKAGE AND A DATA MANAGEMENT PACKAGE FOR THE PARTICULAR DATA STRUCTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE FORM(S). IT IS PROPOSED TO DEVELOP LINKS, TRANSPARENT TO THE USER, TO AT LEAST TWO AND PERHAPS THREE EXTANT DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS, SPECIFICALLY SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION RETRIEVAL, ORACLE, AND SAS. THE DATAENTRY COMPONENT OF THE PROGRAM WILL BE DESIGNED WITH THE NEEDS OF THE MEDICAL RESEARCH COMMUNITY IN MIND. THIS IS IMPORTANT, AS MOST DATA ENTRY PACKAGES AVAILABLE WERE DESIGNED WITH BUSINESS APPLICATIONS IN MIND AND ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY GENERAL FOR USE WITH MEDICAL RESEARCH.",

THIS PROPOSED WORK IS TO EXPLORE THE COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL OF THE P/M METHOD FOR THE PRODUCTION OF NB3SN. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THE PROCESS CAN BE APPLIED TO A WIDE RANGE OF DIFFERENT MATERIALS BUT NB3SN HAS BEEN CHOSEN BECAUSE ITS PROPERTIES, AS PRODUCED BY A NUMBER OF DIFFERENTPROCESSES, ARE WELL KNOWN AND A COMPARISON OF THESE WITH THOSE OF THE P/M PRODUCED MATERIAL WILL PROVIDE US WITH A GOOD WAY TO ASSESS THE PROCESS ITSELF. ALSO THE SMALL P/M WORK AT MIT USING LABORATORY FABRICATION TECHNIQUES, HAS SHOWN CONSIDERABLE PROMISE AND FEWER PROBLEMS WHEN IT IS APPLIED TO NB3SN RATHER THAN TO OTHER SUPERCONDUCTING MATERIALS.

INFRARED MODELING TECHNIQUES AND DATA BASES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED OVERY MANY YEARS AND USED AT SURFACE OPTICS AND MANY OTHER FACILITIES IN OBSERVABLES CONTROL, SIGNATURE PREDICTION, DESIGN AND EVALUATION OF COUNTERMEASURES, AND RELATED FIELDS. THESE MODELING TECHNIQUES CAN MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO PRODUCE THE REQUIRED SCOPE AND NUMBER OF INFRARED IMAGES MUCH MORE ECONOMICALLY AND QUICKLY THAN WOULD BE POSSIBLE BY DIRECT MEASUREMENTS, AND IN TURN MAKE IT FEASIBLE TO FULLY DEVELOP AND PROVE ADVANCED INFRARED IMAGE INTERPRETATION TECHNIQUES. A PHASE I PROGRAM IS PROPOSED TO DEMONSTRATE THE PRODUCTION AND USE OF IR IMAGES PRODUCED BY MODELING. THE SOFTWARE ENSEMBLE MADE IN PHASE I TO PRODUCE INFRATED IMAGES COULD BE USED WITH AN EXPANDED DATA BASE IN PHASE II TO PRODUCE LARGER AND MORE COMPLETE SETS OF IMAGES, AND FOR THE TESTING AND DEVELOPMENT OF MORE ADVANCED INTERPRETATION TECHNIQUES.",

THE MAJOR DIFFICULTY IS THAT THEY ARE LARGE POLYANIONS THAT ARE POORLY TAKEN UP BY CELLS AND ARE SUBJECT TO RAPID DEGRADATION BY NUCLEASES. SYNTHETIC OLIGONUCLEOTIDE PHOSPHOTRIESTERS (PTES) AND METHYLPHOSPHONATES ARE NON-IONIC, LIPOPHILIC MOLECULES THAT ARE STABLE TO NUCLEASES AND WELL TAKEN UP BY LIVING CELLS. DNA PHOSPHOTRIESTERS HYBRIDIZE TO BOTH RNA AND DNA IN VITRO AND CAN SELECTIVELY INHIBIT IN VITRO TRANSLATION. THUS DEFINED SEQUENCE PTES WOULD BE USEFUL IN THE STUDY OF MRNA FUNCTION AND PROCESSING IN VIVO.

A T CELL CLONOTYPE IS DEFINED BY TCAR,WHICH IS COMPOSED OF AN ALPHA AND A BETA POLYPEPTIDE CHAIN. EACH ALPHA AND BETA CHAIN CONSISTS OF VARIABLE (V) AND DIVERSITY (D), JOINING (J) AND CONSTANT (C) DOMAINS. ESTIMATED TOTAL NUMBERS OF V-BETA GENES OF THE TCAR IN THE MURINE SYSTEM ARE APPROXIMATELY TWENTY. PHASE I EFFORTS WILL INCLUDE (1) AN ANALYSIS OF THE TOTAL V-BETA GENE REPERTOIRE AVAILABLE IN HUMANS AND (2) AN ANALYSIS OF THOSE V-BETA GENES EXPRESSED IN THE TUMOR DERIVED T CELLS. FOR THESE STUDIES, A CDNA LIBRARY WILL BE PREPARED FROM TUMOR- DERIVED T CELLS USING A 5' BETA CONSTANT REGION SEQUENCE AS A PRIMER AND APPROPRIATE PHAGES AS VECTOR. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THESE TUMOR-DERIVED V-BETA DNA SEQUENCES WITH THE COMPLETE REPERTOIRE OF V-BETA SEUENCES OBTAINED FROM A LARGE PERIPHERAL T CELL LIBRARY WILL BE DONE. THESE DNA SEQUENCE ANALYSES MABE EXTENDED TO THE V-ALPHA GENES AND TO THE D AND J REGIONS OF ALPHA AND BETA GENES.

NO STAPLES ARE USED AND NO VESSEL EVERSION IS REQUIRED. PHASE I OF THE SBIR PROGRAM WILL TEST THE CONCEPT IN SMALL ANIMALS AND CONDUCT TESTS TO OPTIMIZE THE WRAPPING DEVICE. THE NEW TECHNIQUES IS EXPECTED TO: 1) SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE TIME AND EFFORT REQUIRED TO JOIN VESSELS WITH PRESENT SUTURE METHODS, 2) PROVIDE COJOINING THAT HAS IMPROVED RELIABILITY AND PATENCY, 3) ENHANCE HEALING OF VESSELS BY REDUCING PHYSICAL HANDLING, AND 4) EXPAND THE SCOPE OF MICROSURGERY THROUGH THE USE OF NEW TECHNIQUES. PHASE II OF THIS PROGRAM WILL FOCUS ON PROVING THE LONG-TERM PATENCY OF THIS NEW TECHNIQUE IN ANIMAL AND CLINICAL EXPERIMENTS.

THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED WORK IS TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOP A NOVIX-BASED CONTROL SYSTEM FOR AN ELECTROMECHANICAL SERVOMANIPULATOR. THE GOAL IS TO PROVIDE A CONTROL SYSTEM WHICH ALLOWS THE MANIPULATOR TO FUNCTION EITHER AS A TELEOPERATED SYSTEM FOR NON-REPETITIVE OPERATIONS, OR AS A ROBOT FOR REPETITIVE TASKS-A TELEROBOTICCONTROLLER. USING THE CONTROL SYSTEM DEVELOPED, ALGORITHMS WHICH OPTIMIZE THE CONTROL OF KINEMATICALLY REDUNDNAT MANIPULATORS WILL BE EXPLORED. REDUNDANT MANIPULATOR KINEMATICS ALLOW LOCAL OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE IN CLUTTERED ENVIRONMENTS COMMON TO POWER PLANTS AND POSE A CHALLENGING CONTROL PROBLEM. THIS EFFORT WILL DEVELOP A MANIPULATOR CONTROL SYSTEM WHICH IS COMPACT, VERSATILE, AND ECONOMICAL ALLOWING FUTURE APPLICATION OF MANIPULATION SYSTEMS TO POWERPLANT MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS.

THE UNDERGROUND MINING INDUSTRY LOOKING FOR A WAY TO BLAST IN UNDERGROUND MINE SHAFTS OFTEN RICH IN METHANE GAS HAVE USED THIS CONCEPT IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT OF \"PERMISSIBLE EXPLOSIVES.\" BY ADDING SALTS TO STANDARD EXPLOSIVES FORMULATIONS, THE FIREBALL CAUSED BY A DETONATION CAN BE SNUFFED OUT BEFORE THE METHANE GAS IS IGNITED (ADEQUATE STEMMING IS ALSO REQUIRED). THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS OCCURRING IN THE ACCIDENTAL DETONATION OF AN EXPLOSIVE CAUSED BY LOW ENERGY STIMULI, IS THE INITALLY A DEFLAGRATION OCCURS WHICH OFTEN PROGRESSES ALMOST INSTANTLY INTO A DETONATION. IT IS THE HYPOTHESIS OF THERMEX ENERGY CORPORATION THAT IF HALOGENATED AGENTS WERE INTRODUCED INTO STANDARD MILITARY MUNITION FILLS, THERE IS A REASONABLE EXPECTATION THAT SENSITIVITY TO LOW ENERGY STIMULI AND FIRE COULD BE REDUCED. THE ACCIDENTIAL LOW ENERGY STIMULI WOULD TRIGGER THE RELEASE OF HALOGEN IONS (RADICALS) AT THE SAME INSTANT IT INITIATED THE DEFLAGRATION. THE HALOGEN IONS BEING MORE ACTIVE AND HAVING THE OPPOSITE POLARITY WOULD TEND TO TAKE THE IONS OF COMBUSTION OUT OF THE REACTION COMBINING WITH THEM TO FORM AN INERT COMPOUND, SNUFFING OUT THE FLAME.",

OFF THE SHELF COMMERCIAL SLURRIES WILL NEVER BE PARTICULARLY SUITED FOR MILITARY APPLICATIONS, BECAUSE DESIGN CRITERIA IS DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT. SLURRIES ARE MADE TO BE USED NOT STORED.

THER IS HOWEVER, ONE GREAT BENEFIT OF OFF THE SHELF SLURRIES; PRICE IS EXPRESSED IN PENNIES PER POUND. THE LAST 15 YEARS HAVE MARKED DYNAMIC IMPROVEMENTS IN SLURRY TECHNOLOGY. IN 1978 THE U.S. ARMY QUALIFIED A TWO COMPONENT BLASTING AGENT, HAVING A LONGER SHELF LIFE, WHICH IS FUNCTIONAL FROM -25 DEG F TO +125 DEG F AND HAS A CRATERING ABILITY OF 1.5 TIMES THAT OF TNT.

THE PAPER DISCUSSED SOME OF THE PROBLEMS INHERENT IN THE USE OF THE POHC CONCEPT AS A MEANS TO VALIDATE INCINERATOR PERFORMANCE AND SUGGESTED AN ALTERNATIVE METHODOLOGY INVOLVING THE USE OF PERFLUORINATEDCOMPOUNDS AS MARKERS FOR DRE. SEVERAL FACTORS WHICH MAKE THESE COMPOUNDS SUITABLE CANDIDATES WERE EXAMINED WITH THE CONCLUSION THAT SULFUR HEXAFLUORIDE (SF6) WAS RECOMMENDED ASSUITABLE SURROGATE FOR INDICATING THE DRE OF INCINERATORS FOR POHC COMPOUNDS. THE MAJOR DRAWBACK TO EPA ACCEPTING THE METHODOLOGY AS A TOOL IS THE LACK OF DATA CORRELATING THE POHC DRE'S WITH THOSE OF SF6. TRACER TECHNOLOGIES PROPOSES APHASE I PROGRAM TO CORRELATE SEVERAL POHC DRE'S WITH SF6 DREUNDER A VARIETY OF LABORATORY CONDITIONS. SHOULD THE TECH- NIQUE CONTINUE TO PROVE A SATISFACTORY METHOD, A PHASE II PROGRAM COULD BE INITIATED WHICH WOULD LEAD TO THE DEVELOP- MENT OF AN ECONOMICAL PROTOTYPE TEST SYSTEM WHICH COULD BE INSTALLED AND OPERATED ON A CONTINUOUS, REAL TIME BASIS.

IF SUCCESSFUL, THIS RESEARCH WILL PROVIDE A BASIS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SEMI-AUTOMATED SYSTEM BY WHICH 3-D DESCRIPTIONS OF MAN-MADE TARGETS WILL BE ANALYZED FOR DETERMINATION OF THE MOST EFFICIENT AND RELIABLE MEANS OF RECOGNIZING THE TARGETS IN A FIELD ENVIRONMENT. THE PROPOSED EFFORT WILL FIRST INVESTIGATE 3-D METHODS OF PREDICTING THE INFRARED SIGNATURE OF TARGETS UNDER REPRESENTATIVE VIEWING CONDITIONS. THEN THE PREDICTED SIGNATURES AND ITS VARIABILITY WILL BE STUDIED TO DEVELOP METHODS TO GAUGE THE DISCRIMINABILITY AMONG SEVERAL TARGETS BASED ON THE PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TARGET, INFRARED RADIATION PHENOMENA, THE SENSOR CHARACTERISTICS, AND IMAGING CONDITIONS.",

THE PURPOSE OF OUR PHASE I RESEARCH IS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING AN EXPERT DESIGN AID WHICH HAS KNOWLEDGE OF BOTH THE DESIGN PROCESS AND THE MODULAR ARCHITECTURES. THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE DEFINITION OF THE KEY COMPONENTS OF THE EXPERT SYSTEMS KNOWLEDGE BASE BY (1) DEFINING A HIERARCHICAL METHOD FOR INPUTTING THE EMBEDDED ELECTRONIC SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS, (2) REVIEWING AND CLASSIFYING MODULAR ARCHITECTURES, AND (3) DEFINING THE RULES AND INFERENCE STRUCTURES REQUIRED TO PERFORM ARCHITECTURAL TRADEOFFS.

THE RESPONSE OF MATERIALS TO THIS ENVIRONMENT INCLUDES HIGH STRESSES, RADIATION DAMAGE, AND SURFACE EROSION RESULTING FROM SPUTTERING BY PLASMA PARTICLES. WHILE BARE CARBON IS PRESENTLY USED AS THE LOW ZPLASMA FACING MATERIAL IN SOME TOROIDAL MACHINES, IT IS NOT REACTOR RELEVANT BECAUSE OF A HIGH TRITIUM PERMEATION. THE MOST WIDELY AND SUCCESSFULLY USED PLASMA FACING MATERIAL IS TIC COATED GRAPHITE PRODUCED BY CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION (VCD). THE TIC SURFACE HAS A LOW Z, LOW SPUTTERING RATES, AND GOOD PERFORMANCE UNDER HIGH HEAT LOADS. THE PRESENT CVDPROCESS PRODUCES COATINGS 20-40 MICRONS THICK AND THICKER COATINGS ON THE ORDER OF 0.5-1 CM THICK WILL BE REQUIRED FORFUTURE MACHINES. WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY OF EXPANDING OUR PROPRIETARY TIC CVD PROCESS TO PRODUCE DEPOSITS TWO TO THREE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE THICKER THAN PRESENTLY AVAILABLE. A HIGH STRENGTH, THICK COATING WILL BE PRODUCED BY MEANS OF INFILTRATING GRAPHIC FIBER STRUCTURES WITH TIC. AN EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM TO DETERMINE THE CORRECT DEPOSITION PARAMETERS FOR FIBER INFILTRATION IS PROPOSED TO PRODUCE THICK, DENSE TIC BLANKETS IN ANY SHAPE WHICH IS LIKELY TO BE MORE ECONOMICAL THAN OTHER COMPETING PROCESSES. THE PERFORMANCE AND ADHESION OF THE THICK TIC BLANKET WILL BE DETERMINED BY ANALYSIS HERE AND BY TESTS UNDER PARTICLE BOMBARDMENT AT SNL, UCLA, AND HEDL. FIRST WALL AND LIMITER SURFACES SUCCESSFULLY PRODUCED BY THIS PROCESS WILL HAVE THE MATERIALS PERFORMANCE REQUIRED FOR FUSION REACTORS.",

IT SHOWS PROMISE AS A PRACTICAL, LOW-COST TECHNIQUE FOR QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE OPTIC DISK. A COMMON PROBLEM IN DIGITAL PHOTOGRAMMETRY IS THAT OF ACCURATELY DETERMINING THE STEREOBASE ASSOCIATED WITH A GIVEN PAIR OF IMAGES. CONTROL OF STEREOBASE IS PARTICULARLYDIFFICULT WHEN A STANDARD MONOSCOPIC FUNDUS CAMERA IS USED TO COLLECT STEREO IMAGES BY SHIFTING THE CAMERA SLIGHTLY BETWEEN PICTURES. CAMERA MOTION, PATIENT HEAD MOTION, AND EYE ROTATION ALL AFFECT THE STEREOBASE. EYE ROTATION IS PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT TO CONTROL, AND THE RESULTING ERRORS IN STEREOBASE LIMIT THE REPEATABILITY OF ELEVATION MEASURE- MENTS MADE WITH CURRENT INSTRUMENTS. THIS PHASE I EFFORT ISDEVOTED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF PHOTOGRAPHIC AND IMAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES THAT CAN MEASURE THE EYE ROTATION ASSOCIATED WITH A PAIR OF IMAGES AND MAKE CORRECTIONS FOR ITIN THE ELEVATION CALCULATIONS. THE RESEARCH PLAN INCLUDES BOTH THEORETICAL PHOTOGRAMMETRIC STUDIES TO MODEL THE PHOTO-GRAPHIC PROCESS AND EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES WITH A MODEL EYE TOTEST THE MATHEMATICAL MODEL. FINALLY, THE TECHNIQUES WILL BE APPLIED TO SEQUENTIAL STEREO FUNDUS PHOTOGRAPHS FOR WHICHSIMULTANEOUS STEREO PHOTOGRAPHS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE AS A STANDARD. THESE NEW TECHNIQUES WILL PERMIT THE COLLECTION OF ACCURATE, REPEATABLE ELEVATION DATA FROM THE OPTIC DISK USING SEQUENTIAL STEREO IMAGES FROM STANDARD CAMERAS.

A READILY METABOLIZED, NONTOXIC FLUID IS USED AS THE CHARGING MEDIUM, AND THE DEVICES THEMSELVES ARE FAB- RICATED FROM SILICONE RUBBER WITH AN INTEGRALLY TEXTURED SURFACE BEING SEPARATELY DEVELOPED. A SERIES OF 18 ANIMAL EXPERIMENTS ARE TO BE USED TO (1) EXAMINE HEALING AROUND THEDEVICES UNDER A WIDE RANGE OF VOLUME AND FIRMNESS; (2) EVALUATE THE SUITABILITY OF THE PERCUTANEOUS FILLING SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN DESIGNED; AND (3) EVALUATE THE VOLUME STABILITY OF THE IMPLANTED DEVICES. BECAUSE THE TISSUE CAPSULE THICKNESS AROUND THE DEVICES IS CONTROLLED, THE TACTILE SURFACE AND VOLUME OF THE IMPLANTED DEVICES SHOULD BE READILY ADJUSTABLE TO COMPENSATE FOR LATE TISSUE CHANGES OR CONTINUED THERAPY.",

THE FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF MATGLAS (R) IS SEVERELY LIMITED BY EDDY CURRENT AND SKIN DEPTH EFFECTS SO THAT PULSE WIDTHS LESS THAN CA.40 NSEC ARE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE. FERRITES HAVE BETTER HIGH-FREQUENCY RESPONCE DUE TO THEIR INSULATING NATURE, WITH PULSE WIDTHS OF SEVERAL NSEC HAVING BEEN REPORTED. HOWEVER, FERRITES AREHEAVY, BULKY, EXPENSIVE, AND HAVE RELATIVELY LOW VALUES OF SATURATION MAGNETIZATION--TYPICALLY ONLY CA.2000 GAUSS. IN RECENT YEARS IT HAS BECOME PRACTICAL TO CONSIDER THE MASS PRODUCTION OF MICROLAMINATED SQUARE LOOP MATERIALS BASED ON CRYSTALLINE OR AMORPHOUS NI-FE-CO ALLOYS. IN THESE MATERIALS THE INDIVIDUAL MAGNETIC LAYERS WILL BE MUCH LESS THAN ONE MICRON THICK; THEREFORE, THEY WILL RETAIN THEIR LOW-LOSS SWITCHING BEHAVIOR UP TO THEIR NATURAL FERROMAGNETIC RESONANCE FREQUENCY, WHICH CAN BE > 1 GHZ (I.E., < 1 NSEC).
