IDENTIFICATION OF LOOSENING AT EARLY STAGES MAY PROVIDE THE BASIS TO PROLONG THE SERVICE OF THE IMPLANT BY ALLOWING PRESCRIPTION OF LIMITED WEIGHT BEARING AND DECREASED ACTIVITY. A TESTING TECHNIQUE IS PROPOSED WHICH IS NOT SOLELY DIRECTED TOWARD THESE IMPLANTS BUT IN GENERAL MAY FIND USEFULNESS IN EVALUATION OF THE INTERFACE BETWEEN ANY NONCONDUCTIVE MATERIAL AND AN ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTIVE MATERIAL BOTH IN BIOMEDICINE AND GENERAL ENGINEERING. THE METHOD INVOLVES IMPARTING A STRESS WAVE IN THE CONDUCTIVE MATERIAL BY ELECTROMAGNETIC MEANS.

THE RESEARCH PROPOSED HEREIN WOULD RESULT IN A NONINTRUSIVE MEANS OF DETERMINING THE MAGNITUDE AND DIRECTION OF VELOCITY AND THE CORRESPONDING FLOW RATES BY THE USE OF LASER TOMOGRAPHY. LASER TOMOGRAPHY MAKES USE OF THE FACT THAT, FOR PROPERLY TUNED LASERS, THE DECAY OF LASER BEAM INTENSITY (EXTINCTION) DEPENDS UPON THE VELOCITY OF THE FLUID THROUGH WHICH IT PASSES. IN THE CASE OF AXISYMMETRIC FLOWS, SUCH AS IN A PIPE, THE FLOW RATE CAN BE DETERMINED FROM THE ATTENUATION OF A SINGLE BEAM PASSING THROUGH THE FLOW. THE DETAILS OF THE VELOCITY FIELD FOR SUCH A FLOW CAN BE OBTAINED WITH A MULTIBEAM ARRANGEMENT ACROSS THE FLOW. THE METHOD CAN ALSO BE EXTENDED TO COMPLEXTHREE-DIMENSIONAL FLOWS, WHEREIN A MATRIX OF LASER BEAMS COULD BE USED. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TODEVELOP A PRACTICAL LASER TOMOGRAPHY DEVICE FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF VELOCITIES AND FLOW RATES IN FLOWFIELDS OF BOTH FUNDAMENTAL AND PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE.",

PHASE I RESEARCH IS TO FIND THE FEASIBILITY AND VALIDITY OF SIMULATING MOTIONS ON A SIZABLE STRUCTURE BY USING COLD GAS PULSE GENERATORS THAT DUPLICATE STRONG MOTIONEARTHQUAKES. PHASE II WILL BE DEVOTED TO EXPERIMENTS AND RESEARCH ON HIGH PRESSURE STEAM PULSE GENERATORS FOR REPETITIVE PULSES WITH THRUSTS FROM 50,000 TO 75,000 LBF. OPERATIONAL FEATURES OF PORTABILITY AND EASE OF SET-UP AND OPERATION REMAIN AS REQUIREMENTS IN SPITE OF THE HIGH PRESSURES, HIGH TEMPERATURE, AND SURGE SUPPRESSION, AND THESE MUST BE ACCOMMODATED. TWO UNITS WILL BE BUILT, AND RESEARCH AND EXPERIMENTS ON THESE UNITS WILL BE MADE IN ORDER TO GENERATE THE REQUIRED OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS. PHASE II WILL CONTINUE DEVELOPING THE COLD GAS APPARATUS (RATED AT 10,000 LBF.) FOR OPERATIONAL USE. STUDIES WILL BEMADE FOR APPLICATION TO SMALL BUILDINGS, LARGE EQUIPMENTS, PIPING SYSTEMS, OPEN-FRAME STRUCTURES, AND POWER DISTRIBUTION CENTERS.",

DATING FROM THE EARLY 1930'S, ONLY THE MOUSE HAS CHALLENGED THE POSITION OF THE FROG. IN RECENT YEARS CONTRIBUTIONS USING FROGS HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY IMPEDED BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF GENETICALLY DEFINED STRAINS. SUCH FROGS ARE BADLY NEEDED FOR THE TRANSFER OF FOCUS OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND GENETIC ENGINEERING FROM MICROBES AND PLANTS TO HIGHER VERTEBRATES. SUCH STRAINS OF FROGS ARE NOWAVAILABLE ON ONLY A VERY LIMITED BASIS, AND AMONG THESE STRAINS NONE CARRY VISIBLE PHENOTYPIC MARKERS, THUS RENDERING DIFFICULT THEIR USE IN MANY LABORATORIES. WHILE AVAILABLE STRAINS CAN NOW BE COMMERCIALLY PRODUCED, STRAINS CARRYING VISIBLE MARKERS WILL HAVE MUCH GREATER USE. WE ASK TWO QUESTIONS WHOSE ANSWERS ARE THE OBJECTIVES OF THE PHASE I RESEARCH: (1) ARE THE COLOR, COLOR PATTERN AND MORPHOLOGICAL VARIENTS NOW IN OUR \"XENOPUS LAEVIS\" COLONY, OR AVAILABLE TO US, UNDER GENETIC CONTROL? (2) IF SO, ARE THE GENETIC MECHANISMS WHICH CONTROL THEM OF A TYPE SUITABLEFOR USE AS MARKERS OF GENETICALLY DEFINED LINES OF ANIMALS?

PRESENT SENSORS REQUIRE EITHER CRYOGENIC COOLING OR THE USE OF BULKY PHOTOTUBES WHICH ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MODERN MINIATURIZEDLOGGING INSTRUMENTATION. THE MOST COMMONLY USED ROOM TEMPERATURE SOLID STATE NUCLEAR SENSOR, CDTE, HAS CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED THE REDUCTIONS IN INSTRUMENT SIZE AND COMPLEXITY POSSIBLE WHEN THE NEED FOR COOLING IS ELIMINATED.CDTE HOWEVER, IS LIMITED TO TEMPERATURES ONLY SLIGHTLY ABOVE ROOM TEMPERATURE. AN ALTERNATIVE SEMICONDUCTOR FOR NUCLEAR SENSORS IS ZNTE, WHICH IS CHEMICALLY AND ELECTRICALLY VERY SIMILAR TO CDTE. HOWEVER, ITS WIDER BANDGAP WILL ALLOW A ZNTE DETECTOR TO OPERATE AT THE HIGHER TEMPERATURES ENCOUNTERED IN DOWNHOLE LOGGING. A PROGRAM IS PROPOSED TO MAKE ZNTE DEVICES USING THE SAME GROWTH AND FABRICATION PROCEDURES WHICH HAVE BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL FOR CDTE. PHASE I OF THIS PROGRAM WILL INVESTIGATE THE PHYSICAL, MATERIAL AND ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES OF ZNTE GROWN BY THE TRAVELLING HEATER METHOD AND WILL DETERMINE THE STEPS NEEDED TO BRING ABOUT THE FULL POTENTIAL OF THE ZNTE DEVICES WHICH WILL OPERATE NEAR 200 DEGREES C. ACTUAL ZNTE GAMMA RAY SENSORS WILL BE MADE TO DEMONSTRATE THE BASIC FEASIBILITY OF THIS APPROACH.",

SUCH SENSORS COULD REDUCE THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY, AND ULTIMATELYTHE COST, OF MODERN DETECTOR SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION, THEY WOULD OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF FABRICATING COMPACT, HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION, MULTI-ELEMENT ARRAYS. UTILIZATION OF SILICON AVALANCHE DETECTORS FOR THIS APPLICATION HAS BEEN INHIBITED IN THE PAST BY SEVERAL TECHNICAL PROBLEMS RELATED TO SMALL SIZE, LOW INTERNAL GAIN, AND VERY POOR SENSITIVITY AT THE WAVELENGHTS AT WHICH BGO AND OTHER IMPORTANT SCINTALLATORS EMIT LIGHT. HOWEVER, UNDER A RECENT PROGRAM TOEXAMINE THE FEASIABILITY OF MAKING LARGE AREA LOW NOISE AVALANCHE DIODES FOR USE WITH NAI AS GAMMA DETECTORS, THESES LIMITATIONS HAVE PARTIALLY BEEN OVERCOME. ONE-INCH DIAMETER DETECTORS WITH USEFUL INTERNAL GAIN AND GOOD SENSITIVITY TO THE SHORT WAVELENGTH LIGHT EMITTER BY NAI HAVE BEEN SUCESSFULLY FABRICATED.

THIS IMMEDIATE EFFORT WILL ASSESS WHETHER NEW RELATIONAL DATA BASE MANAGEMENT METHODS AND INTERACTIVE GRAPHICS CAN BE INTEGRATED WITH SELECTED OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS TO MAKE MATHEMATICAL MODELS EASIER TO DEVELOP, ANALYZE, AND INTEGRATE INTO COMMERCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES. THE LONG TERM GOAL IS TO INTEGRATE DATABASE MANAGEMENT, INTERACTIVE GRAPHICS AND OPTIMIZATION PROGRAMS INTO A SINGLESYSTEM. THE CLAS OF OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS CONSIDERED HERE USE THE \"ROW-COLUMN\" (TABLEAU) STRUCTURE TO REPRESENT SYSTEMS UNDER STUDY, AND ARE NATURAL CANDIDATES FOR A RELATIONAL INTERFACE. THESE ALGORITHMS INCLUDE LINEAR PROGRAMMING, NETWORK OPTIMIZATION (INCLUDING ASSIGNMENT AND CMP/PERT), INTEGER LINEAR PROGRAMMING, AND CONVEX PROGRAMMING WITH ADDITIVE OBJECTIVE AND CONSTRAINT RELATIONSHIPS. THIS PROPOSAL (PHASE I) ADDRESSES THE INITIAL PHASES OF DEVELOPMENT, ASSESSMENT, AND SELECTION WHICH ARE NECESSARY TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS APPROACH.

ALSO,LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS ARE REMOVED FROM THE REAL WORLD, IN WHICH EVENTS OFTEN OCCUR MUCH DIFFERENTLY. SOME STUDIES HAVE BEEN PERFORMED ON CLASSIC PRESSURE TRANSDUCERS APPLIED TO SHOE SOLES, BUT THESE ARE LIMITED TO THE LAB, AND THE EFFECT OF TRANSDUCER STIFFNESS ON SHOE DYNAMICS IS QUESTIONABLE. THE SYSTEM DESCRIBED HEREIN CAN OVERCOME THESE SHORTFALLS. FIBER OPTIC PRESSURE SENSORS EMBEDDED IN A SHOE SOLE WOULD HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON THE SHOE DYNAMICS. A FIELD-PORTABLE DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEM WOULD ALLOW REAL WORLD MEASUREMENTS AND SHOW THE SENSITIVITY TO FIELD TERRAIN, ACTIVITY TYPE, ETC. ALONG WITH DEVELOPMENT OF A FIELD-PORTABLE SYSTEM TO MEASURE VERTICAL FOOT FORCES RESEARCH INTO MEASURING FORWARD-AFT SHEAR IN THE FOOT WILL BE STUDIED IN THE LABORATORY.",

THE USER WILL INTERACT WITH THE OSD TO REQUEST MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ANY PARTICULAR SCENE FEATURE. THE USER, NOT THE OSD, WILL PROVIDE THE CONTEXT AND COGNITIVE ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND THE SCENE. THE OBJECTIVES OF THE OSD WILL BE TO INCREASE USER COGNIZANCE AND MOBILITY AND, IF POSSIBLE, TO INCREASE USER PRODUCTIVITY AND EMPLOYMENT OPTIONS. THE RESEARCH FOR PHASE I WILL BE TO COMPLETE CONSTRUCTION OF THREE OSD'S AND CONDUCT FIELD STUDIES AT THE BRAILLE INSTITUTE.

CURRENT DEVELOPMENT OF EXPANDED AGRICULTURAL PROGRAMS UTILIZING PERENNIAL IRRIGATION SCHEMES AND WATER IMPOUNDMENT HAVE PROMOTED THE SPREAD OF THIS DISEASE. DEVELOPMENT OF VACCINES HAS BEEN SLOW FOR THIS AND OTHER WELL-KNOWN PROTOZOAN AND HELMINTHIC INFECTIONS. A MOST PROMISING APPROACH HAS BEEN UTILIZATION OF RADIATION-ATTENUATED CERCARIAE OR SHCISTOSOMULA WHICH IS INTENDED TO STIMULATE ANTIBODY PRODUCTION IN THE HOST WITHOUT RESULTING IN A FULL-SCALE INFESTATION OR FURTHER PROPAGATION OF THE PARASITE. RESULTS TO DATE HAVE NOT BEEN DEFINITIVE ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY ADOPTION OF THIS APPROACH AS A METHOD OF PREVENTION OR CONTROL. IN PREPARING THE IRRADIATED VACCINES, LOW LINEAR ENERGY TRANSFER (LET) RADIATION (X-RAYSAND ELECTRONS) HAVE BEEN USED. WE BELIEVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN RELIABILITY OF RESULTS (STERILITY AND INHIBITION OF GROWTH ALONG WITH ADEQUATE HOST ANTIBODY PRODUCTION) CAN BE ACHIEVED BY USE OF HIGH LET RADIATION PROTONS, NEUTRONS, OR HEAVIER CHARGED PARTICLES). THE RELATIVELY HIGH MUTAGENICITY VS. KILL OF HIGH LET RADIATION HAS BEEN WELL ESTABLISHED. SHOULD THIS APPROACH PROVE CORRECT, WE BELIEVE THE PROBABILITY OF PREPARING A LONGER- LIVED VACCINE IS ENHANCED. WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY OTHER STUDY USING THIS APPROACH. THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS HAVEHAD EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN THE APPLICATIONS OF RADIATION INGENERAL AND IN THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR A VACCINE. SHOULD THE RESULTS OF PHASE I PROVE POSITIVE, IT WOULD LEAD TO A PHASE II EFFORT DIRECTED TOWARD ACHIEVING ACCEPTANCE AND RELIABLE, REPRODUCIBLE PRODUCTION. THE COMMERCIAL VALUE OF IRRADIATED ORGANISM VACCINES IN VETERINARY MEDICINEHAS ALREADY BEEN WELL DEMONSTRATED. PRELIMINARY DISCUSSIONSWITH PRINCIPALS OF A MAJOR U.S. PHARMACEUTICAL ORGANIZATION INDICATES THAT THERE COULD BE SIGNIFICANT INTEREST IN DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE, AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE VACCINE. THE GREATEST INTEREST WILL BE WITHIN THOSE ORGANIZATIONS WORKING WITH BIOLOGICALS. A RELIABLE, SAFE, AND LONGER LIVED VACCINE BASED ON IRRADIATED IMMATURE SCHISTOSOMES WILLBE UTILIZED EXTENSIVELY.",

REFINEMENTS IN THEMODELING AND FORECASTING OF ENERGY DEMAND WILL RESULT IN BETTER FORECASTS WHICH CAN BE USED BY UTILITY COMPANIES AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO MORE EFFECTIVELY PLAN FOR THE FUTURE.THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUE RECOGNIZES THE NECESSITY OF USING CONDITIONAL MEANS (BASED ON A SUBSET OF CUSTOMERS) OF RELEVANT VARIABLES AND IT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT CHANGING DISTRIBUTIONS OF THESE VARIABLES. THE FIRST STEP IN THE APPROACH IS TO ECONOMETRICALLY ESTIMATE PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS OF APPLIANCE OWNERSHIP, CONDITIONAL ON CERTAINEXPLANATORY ECONOMIC OR DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES SUCH AS INCOME. STATISTICAL RELATIONSHIPS ARE THEN USED TO DERIVE THE PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION OF THE EXPLANATORY VARIABLES, GIVEN OWNERSHIP OF AN APPLIANCE SUCH AS AIR-CONDITIONING OR POOL-HEATING. THE CONDITIONAL MEANS OF THE EXPLANATORY VARIABLES CAN THEN BE CALCULATED ON THE BASIS OF THIS CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION. PHASE I OF THE RESEARCH WILL FURTHER DEVELOP THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK FOR ESTIMATING CONDITIONAL MEANS AND WILL APPLY THE TECHNIQUE TO ENERGY USAGE DATA FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS COMPANY.",

THIS STUDY WILL: (1) REFINE THE IN VITRO ASSAY BY RE-EXAMINATION OF THE REACTION PARAMETERS, (2) EVALUATE THE IN VITRO ASSAY IN A PILOT EXPERIMENT TESTING THE SERA OF SEVERAL PATIENT GROUPS FOR ENDOTOXIN NEUTRALIZING CAPACITY, AND (3) TEST THE ABILITY OF THE IN VITRO ASSAY TO PREDICT THE THERAPEUTIC EFFICACY OF SELECTED SERA IN THE PREVENTION OF ENDOTOXIN RESPONSE IN AN ANIMAL MODEL.

WE ALSO HOPE THAT THE IN VITRO ASSAY WILL BE USEFUL IN THE ELUCIDATION OF THE MECHANISMS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROTECTION AGAINST ENDOTOXIN AND IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A THERAPEUTIC AGENT FOR ADMINISTRATION TO PATIENTS IN GRAM NEGATIVE SHOCK.THIS PROPOSAL IS SUBMITTED TO THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE RESEARCH PROGRAM.",

HAS DEVELOPED A ROCKET VEHICLE CONCEPT THAT COMBINES THE TRADITIONAL BENEFITS OF BUNDLING SMALL MOTORS TOGETHER WITH AN INNOVATIVE ROCKET NOZZLE TO PRODUCE A CLUSTER-BASED, VERSATILES SINGLE STAGE VEHICLE. THE KEY TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION THAT MAKES SUCH A VEHICLE COMPETITIVE WITH ITS MORE TRADITIONAL MULTI-STAGE COUNTERPARTS IS THE INTEGRATED N NOZZLE ASSEMBLY (TINA). TINA UTILIZES ONE LARGE NOZZLE TO PRODUCE A LARGE EXPANSION RATIO FOR THE HIGH ALTITUDE BURNING MOTOR (S) AS THE SAME NOZZLE FOR THE LOW ALTITUDE BURINING MOTORS. THEREFORE, IT APPEARS THAT A TINA\\CLUSTER BASED VEHICLE COULD AFFORD THE USER AN ATTRACTIVE ALTERNATIVE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW MOTOR\\VEHICLE.

THE PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION IS DERIVED FROM EARLIER NON-INVASIVE RESEARCH ON HUMANS AND FROM INVASIVE STUDIES ON DOGS, IN WHICH AN IMPROVED METHOD OF NON-INVASIVE DETECTION OF THE TIME OF CLOSURE OF THE AORTIC AND PULMONARYVALVES HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. THE TECHNIQUE DEPENDS ON THE DETECTION OF SUBTLE BUT DISTINCT MOVEMENTS OF THE CHEST WALLOVERLYING THE HEART, MOVEMENTS RESULTING FROM THE FORCES CREATED BY CLOSING AND TENSING THESE VALVES. SINCE THE TIMEINTERVAL SEPARATING THE CLOSURE OF THESE TWO VALVES IS KNOWNTO DEPEND ON THE LEVEL OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL PRESSURE, THE APPLICATION OF THIS TECHNIQUE TO THE PROBLEM OF NON-INVASIVEASSESSMENT OF PULMONARY HYPERTENSION IS A NATURAL EXTENSION OF THIS TECHNOLOGY. THIS TECHNIQUE CAUSES NO DANGER OR DISCOMFORT TO THE CHILD, AND DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH HIS/HERCARE OR TREATMENT. PULMONARY HYPERTENSION IS A CENTRAL FACTOR IN PATHOGENESIS OF PERSISTENT FETAL CIRCULATION AND MAY BE A COMPLICATING FACTOR IN RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME. IT IS ALSO A VERY SERIOUS COMPLICATION OF CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS SUCH AS PATENT DUCTUS ARTERIOSUS. IF THIS RESEARCH IS SUCCESSFUL, A PRACTICAL NON-INVASIVE BEDSIDE MONITOR OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL PRESSURE WILL RESULT, WHICH WILL BE SIMPLE AND INEXPENSIVE SO AS TO BE USEFUL EVENIN SMALL HOSPITALS. THE INSTRUMENT MAY HAVE WIDE RANGING COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS. THE INSTRUMENT CAN BE OPERATED BY NURSING PERSONNEL. THE TECHNIQUE WILL COMPLEMENT THE RECENTLY DEVELOPED TRANSCUTANEOUS OXYGEN MONITORING INSTRUMENTATION, AND WILL SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND THE SCOPE OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE NON-INVASIVELY TO THE PHYSICIAN IN THE NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT.",

HUMANCELLS IN CULTURE REPRESENTS AN EXCELLENT ALTERNATIVE SOURCE FOR HUMAN ERYTHROPOIETIN. IF ERYTHROPOIETIN CAN BE ECONOMICALLY PRODUCED FROM HUMAN CELLS IN CULTURE, IT COULD SERVE AS THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF THIS HORMONE. CELL CULTURE HAS THE INHERENT ADVANTAGES OF EASE OF PRODUCTION, COST EFFECTIVENESS AND QUALITY OF PRODUCT. IT ALSO ELIMINATES THE PROBLEM OF UNIDENTIFIED CONTAMINANTS ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTS DERIVED FROM HUMAN BLOOD OR URINE. A HIGH QUALITY,INEXPENSIVE CELL CULTURE-DERIVED EP COULD SATISFY THE ESTIMATED YEARLY MARKET POTENTIAL OF $180 MILLION FOR TREATMENT OF ERYTHROPOIETIN-DEFICIENCY ANEMIAS. THE OBJECTIVE OF PHASE I OF THIS STUDY IS TO SCREEN CANDIDATE HUMAN KIDNEY CELLS FOR THEIR ABILITY TO PRODUCE EP UNDER NORMAL AND INDUCTION CONDITIONS., INITIALLY, SIX KIDNEY CELL LINES WILL BE SCREENED FOR CONSTITUITIVE EP PRODUCTION AND SECRETION. BASED ON THESE STUDIES, THE HIGHEST PRODUCERS WILL BE FURTHER STUDIED USING NINE INDUCTION PROCEDURES. THROUGH THESE EXPERIMENTS, WE HOPE TO DEFINE THE BEST EP PRODUCER CELLS FOR EVENTUAL LARGE SCALE PRODUCTION OF HUMAN EP. IN OUR SCREENING STUDIES, EP PRODUCTION WILL BE QUANTITATED BY MEASURING (59)FE INCORPORATION INTO RABBIT BONE MARROW CELLS.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE PURPOSE OF THIS PHASE I PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP A MAMMALIAN CELL CULTURE ANEUPLOIDY ASSAY USING THE CAK MOUSE CELL LINE. WHILE A GREAT NUMBER OF SHORT TERM ASSAYS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO DETECT COMPOUNDS WHICH INDUCE EITHER GENE MUTATIONS OR CHROMOSOMAL DAMAGE, LITTLE RESEARCH HAS FOCUSEDON THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHORT TERM ASSAYS TO DETECT ANEUPLOIDY. THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MAMMALIAN CELL CULTURE ASSAY TO DETECT ANEUPLOIDY WOULD PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN DETECTING CHEMICALS WHICH MAY CAUSE EITHER BIRTH DEFECTS OR CANCER IN HUMANS. THE CAK LINE IS EXTREMELY USEFUL FOR THISPURPOSE SINCE IT IS NEAR DIPLOID LINE, AND A SELECTIVE SYSTEM CAN BE DEVELOPED IN WHICH ANEUPLOIDY CAN BE DETECTED USING RESISTANCE TO 2,6-DIAMINOPURINE (DAP). THIS ELIMINATES THE NEED TO DETECT ANEUPLOIDY BY COMPARING THE DISTRIBUTION OF CHROMOSOMES IN TREATED AND UNTREATED CELLS. A CLONE OF CAK CELLS, CAK-B3 TOY(R)-13, IS HETEROZGOUS FOR A PHYSICAL MARKER ON CHROMOSOME 8, WHICH CARRIES THE ADENINEPHOSPHORIBOSYL TRANSFERASE GENE. THE MAJOR GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO ESTABLISH A CAK LINE WHICH IS HETEROZYGOUS FOR BOTH APRT AND FOR THE PHYSICAL MARKER ON CHROMOSOME 8. THE GENE CODING FOR APRT WOULD THEN BE LINKED TO A CHROMOSOME WHICH CAN BE EASILY IDENTIFIED IN METAPHASE PREPARATIONS. THE CLONE WHICH IS HETEROZYGOUS FOR BOTH THE PHYSICAL MARKER ON CHROMOSOME 8 AND FOR APRT ACTIVITY CAN BE USED TO SCREEN CHEMICALS EITHER FOR THEIR ABILITY TO INDUCE MUTATIONS OR INDUCE ANEUPLOIDY. RESISTANT CELLS TO DAP (PRESUMABLY APRT) WILL BE EXAMINED FOR LOSS OF THE CHROMOSOME CARRYING THE APRT+ ALLELE WHICH IS A DEMONSTRATION OF ANEUPLOIDY. THIS IS IN CONTRAST TO INDUCTION OF MUTATIONS TO APRT- IN WHICH BOTH THE PHYSICALLYNORMAL AND ABNORMAL CHROMOSOME 8 WOULD BE PRESENT IN RESISTANT CELLS. THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF A RELATIVELYINEXPENSIVE, RAPID SCREENING TEST FOR THESE END-POINTS (ANEUPLOIDY, TUMOR PROMOTION) WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT ADDITION TO CURRENT \"IN VITRO\" SCREENING BATTERIES AND COULD SIGNIFICANTLY LESSEN THE OVERALL COST (TO BOTH THE GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE SECTOR) OF DETERMINING THE SAFETY OF NEW CHEMICALS AND DRUGS. THUS, THE ASSAY DEVELOPED UNDERTHIS PROJECT WILL BECOME A VALUABLE RESOURCE ASSET TO THE NIH, NIEHS, AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES INVOLVED IN PROTECTING HUMAN HEALTH.",

THE LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND PROCESS TECHNOLOGY FOR THE PRODUCTION OF PRODUCTS DERIVED FROM TISSUE CULTURE IS WELL RECOGNIZED BY THE INDUSTRY. ALTHOUGH NEW APPROACHESARE BEING DEVELOPED, A PROBLEM WHICH HAS RECEIVED ONLY LIMITED ATTENTION HAS BEEN AERATION AND AGITATION IN LARGE SCALE TISSUE CULTURE. THIS RESEARCH PROJECT ADDRESSES THE PROBLEM OF AERATION AND AGITATION IN TISSUE CULTURE AND INTRODUCES A NEW TECHNOLOGY AS A PROPOSED SOLUTION. CERTAINLIQUID PERFLUORINATED CHEMICALS (PFC) HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED WHICH ARE IMMISCIBLE IN AQUEOUS MIXTURES, ARE BIOLOGICALLY INERT, AND HAVE HIGH AFFINITIES FOR O(2) AND CO(2) OFTEN REACHING 5-10 TIMES THOSE OF WATER. THIS PROCESS WILL USE A DISPERSION OF PFC IN THE AQUEOUS CULTURE MEDIUM TO FACILITATE THE RECOVERY AND RECYCLING OF PURE PFC AND TO INDUCE BULK MIXING IN THE CULTIVATION REACTOR. THE EXPERIMENTAL OBJECTIVE IS TO EVALUATE THE TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY OF THIS SYSTEM BY GROWING MOUSE L CELLS IN SUSPENSION AND ON MICROCARRIERS. THIS RESEARCH COULD LEAD TO REMOVING ONE OF THE IMPORTANT TECHNICAL OBSTACLES TO GROWING CULTURES AT HIGHER CELL DENSITIES WHILE LOWERING CULTIVATION COSTS.",

THREE FUNDAMENTAL OBJECTIVES RELATED TO A FLEXIBLE SCALA TYMPANI ELECTRODE WILL BE ADDRESSED: (1) ADHESION OF METALLIC CONDUCTORS TO POLYMER (INSULATOR) SUBSTRATE, (2) ETCHING AND PROCESSING OF METALLIC CONDUCTOR TO OBTAIN OPTIMUM GEOMETRY AND (3) EVALUATE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF METAL/POLYMER COMPOSITE. A POROUS POLYSULFONE WILL BE EVALUATED FOR METAL ADHESION UNDER HYDRATED CONDITIONS AND WITH APPROPRIATE CURRENT STIMULATION. DELAMINATION IS A SEVERE PROBLEM WITH PRESENT ELECTRODE CONFIGURATIONS. PRELIMINARY WORK HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT POROUS POLYMER SURFACES ENHANCE METAL ADHESION BY MECHANICAL INTERLOCKING. PRELIMINARY STUDIES WITH METAL COATING ON POROUS POLYSULFONEHAVE DEMONSTRATED EXCELLENT ADHESION EVEN UNDER PROLONGED HYDRATED CONDITIONS. CONTROL OF POLYMER SURFACE ENERGETICS AND SURFACE POROSITY APPEARS TO ENHANCE METALLIC COATING ADHESION SUFFICIENTLY TO WARRANT FURTHER INVESTIGATION.

THE OZONE-HYDROGEN PEROXIDE SYSTEM IS A POWERFUL OXIDIZING MEDIUM AND HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REMOVE REFRACTORY DISSOLVED ORGANICS FROM DEIONIZED WATER AND FROM INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN OZONE ALONE. IT IS BELIEVED TO GENERATE HYDROXYL RADICALS AND OPERATE THROUGH A FREE RADICAL MECHANISM. THE REACTION OF OZONE ALONE PROCEEDS THROUGH A FREE RADICAL MECHANISM UNDER ALKALINE CONDITIONS AND FREE RADICAL AND POLAR MECHANISMS UNDER NEUTRAL CONDITIONS. THE DISINFECTION EFFECT OF A CHEMICAL USUALLY PARALLELS ITS OXIDATION POTENTIAL. THE HYDROXYL RADICAL, THE ACTIVE AGENT OF THE OZONE-HYDROGEN PEROXIDE SYSTEM, IS A SUBSTANTIALLY STRONGER OXIDANT THAN OZONE OR CHLORINE. THIS PROJECT WOULD BE THE FIRST FEASIBILITY EVALUATION OF THE OZONE-HYDROGEN PEROXIDE SYSTEM AS A DISINFECTANT. FURTHERMORE, THE RESULTS SHOULD INDICATE WHETHER THE FREE RADICAL OR POLAR REACTION OF OZONE IS MORE IMPORTANT FOR DISINFECTION.",

HOWEVER, RESEARCH CONDUCTED AT LAWRENCE BERKELEY LABORATORIES INDICATES THAT MANY LIGHT SHELF APPLICATIONS RESULT IN LITTLE OR NO IMPROVEMENT IN DAYLIGHT PENETRATION. DUE TO THE POPULARITY OF USING LIGHT SHELVES IN NEW BUILDING DESIGNS, THERE IS A GREAT NEED TO PERFORM COMPARATIVE RESEARCH ON THE PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS OF LIGHT SHELVES AND DOCUMENT THE RESULTS FOR DISSEMINATION TO THE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY.

THESE GOALS ARE TO BE ACHIEVED BY: (1) ESTABLISHMENT OF OPERATIVE, THERMAL, AND TECHNICAL CRITERIA FOR CONDUCTING THE PROPOSED EFFORT, THROUGH A LITERATURE REVIEW AND CONSULTATION WITH PRACTICING DENTAL CLINICIANS. (2) HEAT TRANSFER AND STRUCTURAL STUDIES TO DETERMINE DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS OF A SELF-COOLED DENTAL DRILL. (3) STUDIES OF TEMPERATURE RESPONSE IN PULPAL TISSUE DURING CAVITY PREPARATION WITH THE SELF-COOLED DENTAL DRILL. (4) DEFINITION OF PHASE II PLAN FOR EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION OF CONCEPT FEASIBILITY AND COMPATIBILITY WITH CURRENT DENTAL OPERATIVE PRACTICE.",

ONE GOAL OF SUCCESSFUL SURGERY, THEN, IS TO PREVENTOR MINIMIZE SCAR TISSUE FORMATION AT THE WOUND SITE. PRELIMINARY STUDIES SUGGEST THAT HYALURONIC ACID (HA) APPLIED BETWEEN THE TENDON AND ITS SHEATH MIGHT DETER ADHESION FORMATION WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY PROMOTING HEALING OFTHE TENDON. USING A PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION OF HYALURONIC ACID TO BE PRODUCED AND CHARACTERIZED AT OUR FACILITY, WE WILL DETERMINE EFFECTIVENESS BASED ON TENDON ADHESION FORMATION IN THE RABBIT TENDON ADHERENCE MODEL SYSTEM. GENERAL CRITERIA WILL ENCOMPASS MICROANGIOGRAPHY, HISTOLOGY, AND BIOMECHANICAL TESTING. EXPERIMENTALLY WE WOULD VARY THE CHAINLENGTH OF THE PREPARATION IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EQUAL HYALURONIC ACID CONCENTRATIONS OF SHORT (LESS THAN 100K), INTERMEDIATE (100-750K), AND LONG CHAIN (GREATER THAN 750K) MOLECULAR WEIGHTS.WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE STUDIES PROPOSED HEREIN (SEE SPECIFICAIMS) CAN DEFINITELY DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF AN HA PREPARATION USED AT THE TIME OF SURGERY TO PREVENT ADHESION FORMATION. IN PARTICULAR, DETERMINATION OF AN EFFECTIVE CHAIN LENGTH IN THE ABOVE PROCESS WOULD ALLOW LESS VISCOUS PREPARATIONS TO BE PRODUCED THUS FACILITATING APPLICATION DURING SURGICAL PROCEDURES. HYALURONIC ACID IS THE PRIMARY SUBSTITUENT OF INTRA-ARTICULAR FLUID, PROVIDING A HIGH VISCOSITY, NUTRIENT MEDIUM WITHIN THE JOINT. INTRA- ARTICULAR SYNOVIAL FLUID WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY 90% BY WEIGHT HA (EXCLUDING WATER), IS THE PHYSIOLOGICAL SUBSTANCE BATHING THE TENDON. THUS, THE IMPLICATION OF THE APPROACH TAKEN IN THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT REPLACEMENT OF THE PRINCIPLE COMPONENT OF SYNOVIAL FLUID (HYALURONIC ACID) AT THE TIME OFSURGERY WILL ELIMINATE TENDON ADHESIONS AND DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE THE PROGNOSIS AFTER TENDON SURGERY. WE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED WITH E.R. SQUIBB & SONS, IN OBTAINING FDAAPPROVAL FOR THE INTRA-ARTICULAR USE OF HA IN HORSES FOR TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATORY AND OTHER DEGENERATIVE JOINT CONDITIONS. THEY HAVE SHOWN INTEREST IN POTENTIAL HUMAN APPLICATIONS OF HA SUCH AS THAT DETAILED IN THIS PROPOSAL. SINCE HA IS UBIQUITOUS TO MANY TISSUES AND FLUIDS OF PHYSIOLOGICAL ORIGIN SUCH AS CONNECTIVE TISSUE, INTRA- ARTICULAR FLUIDS, AND VITREOUS, THIS PROPOSAL IS RELEVANT TO THE MISSION OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ARTHRITIS, DIABETES, AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASE.",

THIS SYSTEM MUST BE FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO HANDLE EXISTING AS WELL AS FUTURE METRICS THAT MAY PROVE USEFUL. MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT MUST BE \"USER-FRIENDLY\" SO THAT RESEARCHERS AND CLINICIANS CAN EASILY USE IT. SPECIFICAIMS IN PHASE I ARE TO PROVE THE TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY OF ACCOMPLISHING THIS OBJECTIVE. THIS REQUIRES DEMONSTRATING THAT A SYSTEM OF SUFFICIENT ACCURACY AND RESOLUTION CAN AUTOMATICALLY DETECT AND TRACK THE FUNDAMENTAL FREQUENCY OF VIBRATION OF THE VOCAL FOLDS (FO), OVER THE ENTIRE RANGE OF FO POSSIBLE, RELIABLY AND WITH NO OPERATOR ADJUSTMENT REQUIRED. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THIS WILL BE DEMONSTRATED IN PHASE I. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYSTEM WILL BE PURSUED IN PHASE II. THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS. THE FIRST IS FOR A SOPHISTICATED RESEARCH TOOL TO ENABLE ADDITIONAL CLINICAL INVESTIGATORS TO EFFECTIVELY AND EASILY CONDUCT THE FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH THATIS STILL NEEDED ON VOCAL PATHOLOGY. THE SECOND IS A SIMPLERSYSTEM (AND LESS EXPENSIVE) FOR USE BY PRACTICING PROFESSIONALS (OTOLARYNGOLOGISTS, OTHER M.D.'S, SPEECH PATHOLOGISTS AND THERAPISTS, HOSPITALS, AND POSSIBLY SCHOOLS). THIS WILL ALLOW A QUANTITATIVE MEASURE OF VOCAL PERFORMANCE, CURRENTLY LACKING, THAT CAN BE OF VALUE IN LONGITUDINAL STUDIES, IN DETECTING PATHOLOGIES AND IN PROVIDING A BENCHMARK OF PERFORMANCE IN EVALUATING THERAPEUTIC EFFECTIVENESS.",

A NONDESTRUCTIVE TEST TECHNIQUE WHICH HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR MEASURING THE DEGREE OF FATIGUE IN MILITARY BRIDGE STRUCTURES HAS BEEN INDENTIFIED BY US. THE TECHNIQUE IS CALLED INTERNAL FRICTION DAMPING NONDESCTRUCTIVE EVALUATION. THE PHYSICAL PROPERTY THAT IS MONITORED IN THIS TECHNIQUE IS THE RATE AT WHICH AN ENERGY IMPULSE IMPARTED TOA MATERIAL OR STRUCTURE DECAYS DUE TO THE INTERNAL FRICTION OF THE MATERIAL. A CHANGE IN THE RATE OF DECAY REFLECTS CHANGES IN THE BASIC CHEMICAL AND/OR MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THE MATERIAL DUE TO AN ACCUMLATION OF SUBTLE MATERIAL VARIABLES. THESE MATERIAL VARIABLES INCLUDE THE GRAIN SIZE, CHEMICAL COMPOSITIONS, INTERSITIAL ELEMENTS, DISLOCATIONS, PRECIPITATE PARTICLES, STRAIN RATE EFFECTS, ETC. BY PROPER MONITORING OF THE ACCUMULATION OF THESE INSIDIOUS VARIABLES, IT IS POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE REMAININGUSEFUL LIFE OF A MATERIAL BEFORE FAILURE OCCURS. IT IS THE OBJECTIVE OF THE FIRST PHASE OF THIS PROGRAM TO ADAPT THIS TECHNIQUE TO MILITARY BRIDGES BY FIRST IDENTIFYING THE CHARACTERISTICS DAMPING COEFFICIENT VERSUS FATIGUE LIFE CURVE FOR BAR SPECIMENTS OF THE MATERIALS USED IN THE BRIDGES AND THEN DEMONSTRATING ITS SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION BY FATIGUING A FULL SIZED BRIDGE GIRDER AND COMPARING THE DDAMPIG COEFFICIENTS DURING ITS FATIGUE LIFE TO THOSE OBTAINED WITH THE BAR SPECIMENS.",

THE SOFTWARE VERIFICATION METHODOLOGIES NORMALLY HEAVILY RELIED ON IN PRODUCING MLS SYSTEMS, ARE ACTUALLY STILL IN THEIR INFANCY. WE SUGGEST HERE A HARDWARE ARCHITECTURE THAT IS INTENDED TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF VERIFICATION REQUIRED. MICROCUMPUTERS HAVE BECOME A HOUSEHOLD ITEM. THE GENERAL PUBLIC (AND CONSEQUENTLY THE AVAILABLE POOL OF PERSONNEL FOR DOD) IS GETTING USED TO A WIDE BASE OF COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE, E.G. CP\\M AND UNIX OPERATING SYSTEMS, VISICALC, DATA BASES, ETC. IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY ATTRACTIVE IF A MLS COMPUTER SYSTEM COULD UTILIZE THIS SOFTWARE BASE WITHOUT THE EXPENSIVE COST OF RETROFITTING IT WITH MLS FEATURES. DIGICOMP'S APPROACH FOR A TRUSTED MLS SYSTEM OFFERS THIS ATTRACTIVE FEATURE AS WELL. PHASE I SHALL DEVELOP THE HARDWARE\\SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE. THE NECESSARY SECUIRTY MODEL AND THE VERIFICATION METHODOLOGY WILL ALSO BE IDENTIFIED FOR THE RECOMMENDED ARCHITECTURE AND A VERIFICATION PLAN DEVELOPED.

THE ARCHITECTURE IS BASED ON THE APPLICATION OF I AND Q BANDWIDTH SAMPLING, DIGITAL IMPLEMENTATION OF FREQUENCY TRANSLATION, FILTERING, MODULATION AND DEMODULATION AND BASEBAND SIGNAL PROCESSING TECHIQUES. ADDITIONALLY, THE ARCHITECTURE IS SOFTWARE RECONFIGURABLE TO MEET ALL HF APPLICATIONS. IN PARTICULAR, THE PERFORMANCE ACHIEVABLE USING DIGITAL FILTERING AND SIGNAL PROCESSING TECHNIQUES FAR EXCEED THAT OF ITS ANALOG COUNTERPART. BITE AND ILS OPPORTUNITIES ARE ALSO SIGNIFICANT DUE TO THE PRIMARILY DIGITAL IMPLEMENTATION AND MODULARITY. A MULTI-INCREMENT TUNING SCHEME IS INCORPORATED WHOSE FINAL STAGE (FINE TUNING 10 HZ STEPS IS IMPLEMENTED DIGITALLY. DUE TO THE UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS OF EACH USERS INTERFACE, A PROGRAMMABLE INTERFACE PROCESSOR IS INCLUDED TO HANDLE CLOCK RATE CHANGES, FORMAT CONTROL, INTERFACE PROTOCOL AND DATA BUFFERING UNDER SOFTWARE CONTROL.",

A BATTERY OF ISOGENIC \"BACILLUS SUBTILIS\" STRAINS WITH MUTATIONS IN VARIOUS DNA OR CHROMOSOMAL REPAIR STEPS, AND CAPABLE OF IDENTIFYING SPECIFIAL CHEMICAL CLASSES, WILL BE USED TO SCREEN HIGH PRIORITY POLLUTANT CHEMICALS FOR THEIR CYTOTOXICITY AND DNA-DAMAGING EFFECTS.

THE SYSTEM WILL USE A MONOCHROMATIC LASER SOURCE TO ILLUMINATE THE \"B. SUBTILIS\" (BACTERIAL) CELL SUSPENSIONSIN A CLEAR CURVETTE. AN ARRAY OF DETECTOR ELEMENTS ARRANGEDSO THAT THEY WILL RECEIVE THE SCATTERED LIGHT AT A SERIES OF DISCRETE ANGLES WILL MEASURE DLS INTENSITY.

THE GENERAL CONCEPT FOR THE ARTIFICAL INTELLIGENCE/ROBOT SUPPLEMENT TO MEDICAL SUPPORT CALLS FOR A SMALL, LIGHT-WEIGHT, TWO UNIT WHEELED VEHICLE USING A TWIN HULL CONSTRUCTION WITH A CONNECTING, FULL ARTICULATED PIVOT. IT WOULD BE OF LOW PROFILE AND NARROW WIDTH YET STILL BE CAPABLE OF CARRYING TWO SOLDIERS IN A PRONE POSITION. THE VEHICLE WOULD BE MONITORED AND DIRECTED FROM A CONTROL VAN TO THE REAR.

BROADENING THE USE OF CARBON-CARBON MATERIALS IN OXIDIZING ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRES THE DEVELOPMENTOF THIN CRACK-FREE OXIDATION-RESISTANT COATINGS FOR HIGH- STRENGTH COMPOSITE SUBSTRATES. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THISPROGRAM IS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF FORMING PROTECTIVE SIC AND SI(3)N(4) COATINGS BY CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION (CVD) ON HIGH-STRENGTH CARBON-CARBON COMPOSITES TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE THERMAL INSTABILITY OF COMPOSITES PROCESSED AT LOW TEMPERATURES. THIS WORK IS CONDUCTED BY CVD COATING 3D CARBON-CARBON SUBSTRATES DENSIFIED AT LOW TEMPERATURES AND MADE FROM UNSTABLE HIGH-STRENGTH CARBON FIBERS. AFTER COATING, THE TEMPERATURE IS RAISED SO THAT SUBSTRATE CONCTRACTS RELATIVE TO THE COATING. THIS CIRCUMVENTS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE MISMATCHED IN THE COEFFICIENT OF THERMAL EXPANSION BETWEEN THE SUBSTRATE AND COATING AND PROVIDES CRACK-FREE COATINGS. BOTH SIC AND SI(3)N(4) COATINGS ARE INCLUDED IN THIS PROJECT BECAUSE THEY DIFFER IN COEFFICIENT OF THERMAL EXPANSION AND ELASTIC MODULUS. COATED SPECIMENS ARE EVALUATED IN STATIC AIR OXIDATION TESTS. SUCCESSFUL DEMONSTRATION OF THE ABOVE CONCEPT IN PHASE I LEADS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIN COATINGSWHICH DON NOT RELY ON GLASS SEALING FRO PROTECTION OF THE SUBSTRATE. SUCH COATINGS ARE REQUIRED FOR COMPONENTS OPERATING UNDER DYNAMIC CONDITIONS AND APPLICATIONS REQUIRING VERY HIGH TEMPERATURE PERFORMANCE.",

TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL WITH PHYSICAL BENEFICIATION TECHNIQUES, IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO FIRST REDUCE THE ROM COAL INTO ULTRAFINE PARTICLES. THIS GENERATION OF FINES RELEASES MOST IMPURITIES AS DISCRETE PARTICLES WITH SPECIFIC GRAVITIES (2.2-4.2) SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN COAL (1.3-1.5). WITH SUCH A DENSITY DIFFERENCE A NEAR PERFECT SEPARATION IS THEORETICALLY POSSIBLE. HOWEVERTHERE IS NO EXISTING BENEFICIATION EQUIPMENT/SYSTEMS WHICH CAN EFFICIENTLY AND ECONOMICALLY AFFECT THIS POTENTIAL NEAR PERFECT SEPARATION WITH A FINE PARTICLE FEED. BASED ON THIS NEED, FOSTER-MILLER, INC. HAS DEVELOPED IN CONCEPT, A HEAVY FLUID BENEFICIATION CENTRIFUGE, COMPACT IN SIZE AND ABLE TO SEPARATE COAL AND WASTE INTO TWO HIGHLY DEWATERED SOLIDS WHILE RECOVERING MOST OF THE CARRIER FLUID. THIS CONCEPT USES A NON-TOXIC AND NON-CORROSIVE TRUE HEAVY FLUID WITH AN INTERMEDIATE SPECIFIC GRAVITY (1.6) BETWEEN COAL ANDWASTE IN COMBINATION WITH THE ADVANTAGES OF CENTRIFUGAL SEPARATION. THE SEPARATION POTENTIAL OF THIS CONCEPT CAN READILY APPROACH THE \"IDEAL SEPARATION\" ATTAINED IN LABORATORY FLOAT-SINK WASHABILITY TESTS.",

THE ASSAY IS BASED ON ENUMERATING CELLS BEARING MUTANT HLA MEMBRANE ANTIGENS AMONG PERIPHERAL BLOOD LYMPHOCYTES. THE MUTATIONS WILL BE DETECTED BY A NOVEL SEROLOGICAL TEST WHICH YIELDS A POSITIVE SIGNAL BY USE OF TWO SELECTED MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES THAT REACT WITH INDEPENDENT REGIONS OF AN HLA HEAVY CHAIN. THIS POSITIVE SIGNAL WILL BE THE RESULT OF ONE OF TWO PROPOSED CONFIGURATIONS IN WHICH THE TWO ANTIBODIES WILL INTERACT NEGATIVELY WITH EACH OTHER. A MUTANT AT ANY SINGLE LOCUS WILL BE DOMINANTLY EXPRESSED WITH THESE ASSAYS AND THE PRESENCE OF MULTIPLE HLA CLASS I LOCI SHOULD INCREASE THE FREQUENCY OF MUTATION AT LEAST FOUR-FOLD COMPARED TO SINGLE ALLELE SYSTEMS. PRELIMINARY WORK HAS RESULTED IN ACQUISITION OF A SERIES OF HLA CLASS I MONOMORPHIC ANTIBODIES WHICH ARE BEING CLASSIFIED BY ADDITION AND COMPETITION EXPERIMENTS. TO TEST THE FEASIBILITY OF THESE ASSAYS, CELLS WITH MUTATIONS IN HLA WILL BE ISOLATED TO USE IN RECONSTRUCTION EXPERIMENTS.",

ANTIBODIES AGAINST PLAQUE-SPECIFIC OR PLAQUE-ASSOCIATED MARKERS WILL BE SELECTED BY COMPARATIVE IMMUNOCYTOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS ON FROZEN SECTIONS OF ATHEROSCLEROTIC AND NORMAL ARTERIES FROM NON-HUMAN PRIMATES AND HUMANS. THIS WILL ENABLE THE IDENTIFICATION AND SELECTION OF ANTIBODIES AGAINST ANTIGENS THAT ARE EXPOSED IN THE LUMEN OF THE BLOOD VESSEL. MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES AGAINST INDIVIDUAL PLAQUE ANTIGENS WILL BE RADIOLABELED WITH (125)I AND INJECTED INTO NON-HUMAN PRIMATES FOR BLOOD CLEARANCE STUDIES. TO CONTROL FOR DIFFERENCES THAT MAY EXIST IN THE VASCULAR SYSTEM OF DIFFERENT ANIMALS, THEY WILL UTILIZE A SECOND (131)I RADIOLABELED MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY WHICH IS KNOWN NOT TO BIND TO ANTIGENS IN THE VASCULAR SYSTEM. BY COMPARING OVER TIME THE RATIO OF THESE TWO ANTIBODIES IN BLOOD, IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO DETECT SPECIFIC CLEARANCE OF THE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY THAT DETECTS ANTIGENS WITHIN THE ATHEROSCLEROTIC PLAQUE. THE EXTENT RATE OF ANTIBODY CLEARANCE SHOULD BE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE AMOUNT OF ATHEROSCLEROTIC PLAQUE IN THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM.

CHANGES IN THE SPATIAL FREQUENCY CONTENT FROM ONE AREA TO THE NEXT OR FROM SCENE WOULD BE INDICATIVE OF CHANGES IN VISIBILITY IN THE VERTICAL PATH ABOVE THE TARGET. DMSP-RESOLVABLE TARGETS WOULD BE LARGE DIMENSIONED GEOLOGICAL FEATURES SUCH AS FOLD BELTS AND JOINT PATTERNS AND MUST PRODUCE A STABEL SPATIAL FREQUENCY PATTEN UNDER LIKE VISIBILITY CONDITIONS. USE WOULD BE MADE OF MAN-MADE PATTERNS DUE TO CROP MARKS AND LIGHTED NIGHTTIME CITY GID PATTERNS.

THE PHASE I EFFORT WOULD BE CONCERNED WITH ESTABLSIHING FEASIBILITY BE SELECTING AND EVALUATION TARGETS FROM ACTUAL DMSP SCENE ARCHIVES. CRITERIA WOULD BE STABILITY OF SPATIAL FREQUENCY CONTENT, AND VARIATION WITH VISIBILITY CHANGES. PHASE II EFFORT WOULD INVOLVE FIELD TESTS OF U.S. TARGETS CHOSEN USING CONVENTIONAL VISIBILITY TECHNIQUES AGAINST THE PROPOSED PERIODIC TARGET CONTRAST METHOD.

CONTINUOUS IN-SITU MONITORING OF PCO(2) AND PO(2) CAN HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN INTENSIVE CARE, OPERATING ROOMS, AND RESEARCH LABORATORIES. THE PRINCIPAL APPLICATIONS OF SUCH A DEVICE INCLUDE MANAGEMENT OF VENTILATION, ACID-BASE BALANCE, AND BASIC RESEARCH. THE PCO(2) MEASUREMENT IS BASED ON THE QUANTITATIVE DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF \"REDUCED-CO(2)\" ABSORBED ON THE PT-BASED WORKING ELECTRODE. PO(2) IS OBTAINED BY MEASURING THE O(2) REDUCTION LIMITING CURRENT IN A WELL DEFINED POTENTIAL REGION. THE PCO(2) AND PO(2) MEASUREMENTS CAN BE MADE AT A HIGH SAMPLING RATE WITHOUT MUTUAL INTERFERENCE. THE PROPOSED MICROELECTRODE IS A FINE WIRE ELECTRODE (E.G. 25 MICRONS IN DIAMETER) WITH A SHARP TIP. GASES TO BE MEASURED PERMEATE THROUGH THE HYDROPHOBIC MEMBRANE COVERING THE TIP AND EQUILIBRATE WITH ELECTROLYTE BEHIND THIS HYDROPHOBIC LAYER. THE WORK PLANNEDIN PHASE I WILL BE CARRIED OUT IN TWO ITERATIVE STAGES. THEFIRST STAGE INVOLVES THE FABRICATION AND EVALUATION OF MICROELECTRODES IN A NUMBER OF PRELIMINARY CONFIGURATIONS. IN THE SECOND STAGE, A FEW ELECTRODES WILL BE FABRICATED USING THE MOST PROMISING CONSTRUCTION DESIGN TO FURTHER REFINE THEIR OPERATING PARAMETERS.",

BY STANDARD IMMUNOLOGIC TECHNIQUES, ANTIBODIES TO HUMAN IGM WILL BE ISOLATED. THESE ANTIBODIES WILL BE COVALENTLY LINKED TO SILICA TO PRODUCE A SPECIFIC IMMUNOADSORBENT. THIS ADSORBENT WILL BE TESTED \"IN VITRO\" IN A PHASE I STUDY TO ASSESS THE QUANTITATIVE REMOVAL OF IGM AND IMMUNOREACTIVE IGM FROM NORMAL AND PATHOLOGIC SERA, RESPECTIVELY. IF EFFICACIOUS, THEN IGM WILL BE ISOLATED FROM NORMAL HUMAN SERUM AND MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES TO THIS IGM WILL BE PRODUCED. THE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY WILL BE COVALENTLY LINKEDTO SILICA, AND TESTED \"IN VITRO\" AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. UPON THE \"IN VITRO\" DEMONSTRATION OF QUANTITATIVE AND SPECIFIC REMOVAL OF IMMUNOREACTIVE IGM FROM THE PATHOLOGIC SERA, IMMUNOADSORBENT COLUMNS (HOUSED IN DISPOSABLE CARTRIDGES) WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR USE IN A PHASE II \"IN VIVO\" STUDY WHICH WILL ASSESS THE EFFECT OF SUCH TREATMENTS WHEN APPLIED TO PATIENTS WITH PBC. THIS \"IN VIVO\" STUDY (PHASE II) WILL PROVIDE EVIDENCE FOR THE EFFICACY OF THIS APPROACH IN REMOVING IMMUNOREACTIVE IGM. PRESENT EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE IGM FROM PBC PATIENTS MAY BEHAVE LIKE AN IMMUNE COMPLEX, ALTHOUGH IT HAS THE SAME PHYSICAL-CHEMICAL PROPERTIES AS NORMAL IGM. WHEN FEASIBLE, A LONG TERM STUDY WILL ALLOW ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER THIS SPECIFIC IMMUNOADSORBENT EXTRACORPOREAL TECHNIQUE WILL ALTER THE NATURAL HISTORY OF THE DISEASE. CURRENTLY THERE IS NO SPECIFIC TREATMENT FOR PBC, AND ITS NATURAL COURSE, ALTHOUGH VARIABLE, TENDS TO BE PROGRESSIVE, LEADING TO DEATH IN TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS.

DESPITE ATTRACTIVE PROPERTIES OF THE COATING MATERIALS, LACKING OF PROPER ADHESION BETWEEN HOST AND COATING MATERIAL FREQUENTLY LIMITS THE USEFULNESS OF THE COATING TECHNIQUES. THE PROPOSED PROCESS IS A PRE-TREATMENT TECHNIQUE WHICH PREPARES THE SUBSTRATE SURFACE FOR THE FORMATION OF CHEMICAL COVALENT BONDS WITH THE COATING MATERIAL FOR DRASTIC ENHANCEMENT OF SURFACE ADHESION. A MICROWAVE INDUCED PLASMA DISCHARGE IMPARTS ENGERY TO A SUITABLE IONIC SPECIES WHICH THEN STRIPS ATOMS FROM THE SURFACE LAYER AND CREATES FREE ARADICALS ON THE SUBSTRATE SURFACE. THESE FREE RADICALS, IN TURN FORM COVALENT BONDS WITH THE COATING MATERIAL APPLIED SUBSEQUENTLY. THE EXISTENCE OF STRONG CHEMICAL BONDS CAN PREVENT THE COATING MATERIAL FROM EVER SEPARATING FROM THE SUBSTRATE SURFACE. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS DESIGNED TO STUDY AND VERIFY THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLE WHICH INVOLVES SURFACE ATOM REMOVAL AND FORMATION OF CHEMICAL BONDS. SUBSTRATE MATERIALS USED WILL INCLUDE POLYCARBONATE, FLUORCARBONDS, POLYIMIDE, SILICONE,SILICA AND OTHER MATERIALS.

PARAMETERS FOR STUDYING BUILDING MATERIALS INCLUDE: POSSIBLE INTERACTION BETWEEN PELLET CAPSULE WALLS OR LAMINATED FILM AND CONCRETE; POSSIBLE WATERVAPOR MIGRATION BETWEEN PCM'S AND CARRIER MATRIX; EFFECT OF ABOVE PHENOMENA ON THERMAL STORAGE; EFFECT OF POSSIBLE PCM LEAKS. TESTING WILL INCLUDE ACCELERATED AGING; CHEMICALTHERMAL ANALYSIS; MECHANICAL, PHYSICAL TESTS ON PROTOTYPE SAMPLES. THE EFFECT OF MOISTURE BARRIERS (I.E. SEALANTS) ONDURABILITY OF PCM MASONRY MATERIALS WILL BE EXPLORED. HERETOFORE, DIFFICULTY EXISTED IN CONTAINERIZING PCM'S WITHIN CONCRETE. IN MANY INSTANCES, IMPROPER INTEGRATION TECHNIQUES OR UNSTABLE PCM WERE USED. THE SMALL PELLET FORM AND VERSATILE FILM PACKAGES HAVE SHOWN LONG TERM DURABILITY, ESPECIALLY WHEN STABLE PCM FORMULATION BASED ON CRYSTAL-MODIFIED GLAUBER'S SALT IS USED, AS PER RECENTLY ISSUED PATENT LICENSED TO INSOLAR, INC. IMPROVED PRE-PACKAGED PCM'S FOR TES WITHIN CONVENTIONAL BUILDING MATERIALS WITH DURABILITY, STABILITY AND FUTURE COMMERCIAL ACCEPTANCE IS THE GOAL.",

UNFORTUNATELY, THE CONVENTIONAL TECHNIQUE OF USING A SINGLE TYPE OF DETECTOR ARRAY WITH MECHANICALLY SWITCHED SPECTRAL FILTERS DOES NOT YIELD OPTIMUM SENSITIVITY NOR CLOSE TEMPORAL CORRELATION OF SPECTRAL INFORMATION. THE IDEAL INFRARED FOCAL PLANE CONFIGURATION CONSISTS OF SEPARATELY TAILORED DETECTOR ARRAYS ON A COMMON SUBSTRATE. THE PROGRAM ADDRESSES DUAL COLOR DETECTOR ARRAYS ON A SINGLE SUBSTRATE AS A MEANS TO ENHANCE MULTISPECTRAL SCANNER PERFORMANCE. THIS PROJECT FOCUSES ON THE ISSUES OF PRECISE ARRAY PLACEMENT AND COMPATIBILITY OF FABRICATION PROCESSES FOR THE TWO TYPES OF DETECTOR ARRAYS. IN GENERAL, LARGE DETECTOR ARRAYS WILL REQUIRE SOME ON-FOCAL PLANE SIGNAL PROCESSING; THEREFORE THE DETECTOR ARRAYS INVESTIGATED IN THIS PROGRAM ARE DESIGNED SO THAT THEY CAN READILY BE INCORPORATED WITH AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT ELECTRONICS CHIP. AT A LATER DATE, THIS FEATURE WILL BE INVESTIGATED IN MORE DETAIL. THE FIRST PHASE OF A LONG-TERM PROGRAM ADDRESSES NOT ONLY PROCESS PROBLEMS OF COMPATIBILITY BETWEEN THE TWO TYPES OF DETECTOR ARRAYS, BUT ALSO ADDRESSES COMPATIBILITY BETWEEN THE DETECTOR PROCESSES AND THE SUBSTRATES AND LEAD METALIZATIONS WHICH ARE REQUIRED FOR OPERATION OF THE DETECTOR ARRAYS.",

EXISTING SOFTWARE PACKAGES WILL PRODUCE COMPUTER GENERATED IMAGES OF TRANSPARENT BUILDINGS AND TERRAIN AS VIEWED FROM A SINGLE LOCATION. THE TACTICAL ENGAGEMENTS NEED SOLID BUILDING AND TERRANIN AS VIEWED FROM A SINGLE LOCATION. THE TACTICAL ENGAGMENTS NEED SOLID BUILDING TO OBSCURE WHAT IS BEHIND THEM AND MULTIPLY VIEW-POINTS FOR THE LOCATIONS OF EACH SMALL UNIT PARTICIPANT. THE HARDWARE IS AVAILABLE AT LOW COST. IT IS ONLY THE SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY THAT IS MISSING. THE PRESENT EFFORT IS TO REDESIGN CGI SOFTWARE PACKAGES SO THAT (1) DIFFERENT VIEWPOINTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR EACH PERSON PARTICIPATING IN A SMALL UNIT ENGAGMENT SIMULATION AND (2) THE CGI IMAGES ARE NOT TRANSPARENT, I.E., THE IMAGES OCCLUDE WHAT IS BEHIND THEM FOR EACH PARICIPANT'S VIEWPOINT\\LOCATION.

THE CONCEPT IS BASED ONTHE UNIFORM EVAPORATION OF THE CRYOGENIC MATERIAL DURING ITSTRAVEL ACROSS THE MINOR DIAMETER OF THE MACHINE. THE ABLATION RATE IS DETERMINED BY THE PHYSICS OF THE HEAT CONDUCTION FROM THE LOW-DENSITY, HIGH-TEMPERATURE TOKAMAK PLASMA. THE INJECTION VELOCITY REQUIRED IS DETERMINED BY THE PELLET MASS, THE MACHINE'S MINOR DIAMETER AND THE ABLATION RATE. RECENT EXPERIMENTS SUGGEST THE EVAPORATION RATE TO BE LARGE, THUS REQUIRING INJECTION VELOCITIES IN EXCESS OF 10 KM/SEC. ACHIEVEMENT OF THESE HIGH VELOCITIES IS A TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGE. BEFORE A REALISTIC INJECTION PROCESS CAN BE DESIGNED, A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE ABLATION PHYSICS MUST BE OBTAINED. TO DATE, ONLY SIMPLY STEADY-STATE MODELS HAVE BEEN USED TO EXPLAIN THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS. ABLATION PHYSICS IS A COMPLICATED PROCESS WHICH IS BEST HANDLED IN A TIME-DEPENDENT FASHION VIA NUMERICAL SIMULATION STUDIES. WE PROPOSE TO CONSTRUCT SUCH A CODE IN PHASE I WHICH WILL BE A POWERFUL TOOL IN DESIGNING EXPERIMENTS FOR LARGER MACHINES.",

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO INVESTIGATE AND DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITI OF SEVERAL INNOVATIVE APPROACHES FOR PRODUCING 50 FOOT LENGTHS OF DIE SIZED WIRE. THIS PROGRAM STUDIES THE EFFECTS OF COMBINING A MULTI-LINE, TIB CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION UNIT, A LINE-OF-SIGHT LIQUID METAL PUMP INFILTRATION SYSTEM, AND A HEATED FIXED DIE SYSTEM TO FORM LONG LENGTHS OF UNIFORM SIZED GRAPHITE- ALUMINUM WIRE. THE PROGRAM CONCENTRATES ON IDENTIFYING AND IMPROVING YARN TRANSPORT, YARN ACTIVATION, YARN INFILTRATION DIE SIZING, AND MAINTENANCE OF CRITICAL TEMPERATURES IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE WIRE DEFECTS AND MAXIMIZE LENGTH. PARTICULAR ATTENTION WILL BE GIVEN TO DIE MATERIALS, ENTRANT ANGLES, AND TEMPERATURES. THIS PROJECT PROVIDES THE BASIS FOR A MORE EXTENSIVE DEVELOPMENT EFFORT TO MASS-PRODUCE GRAPHITE-ALUMINUM WIRE FOR SPACE STRUCTURES AND PROVIDES WIRE FOR R&D; ON STRUCTURES SUCH AS GEODETIC BEAMS, CONES, AND CYLINDERS.",

HOWEVER, THEY ARE GENERALLY UNAVAILABLE TO HOSPITALS DUE TO THE HIGH COST OF AN IN-HOUSE CYCLOTRON. THE PROPOSED PROGRAM IS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW ACCELERATOR SOURCE WHICH CAN GENERATE SHORT-LIVED RADIONUCLIDES ON SITE AT LOW COST. THIS WILL BROADEN THE USE OF POSITRON-EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY IN NUCLEAR MEDICINE IN THE UNITED STATES. THE NEW SOURCE ISA PLASMA FOCUS DEUTERON SOURCE (PFDS). DEUTERONS HAVE BEEN PRODUCED WITH PLASMA FOCUS DEVICES. IN THE PROPOSED PHASE IPROGRAM, A PROOF OF CONCEPT SOURCE WILL BE BUILT AT MAXWELL BY MOUNTING A PLASMA FOCUS DEVICE ON AN EXISTING PULSE POWERSYSTEM (A COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE MAXWELL PRODUCT, MAGNEFORM [R] 8000); THE USE OF AN EXISTING SUPPLY MINIMIZES THE COST OF THE PROOF OF CONCEPT DEMONSTRATION. THIS SOURCE WILL BE USED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE DEUTERONS GENERATED BY THE PFDSHAVE ENOUGH ENERGY TO PRODUCE (15)O THROUGH THE REACTION (14)N(D,N) (13)O WHEN THEY IMPINGE ON A SOLID TARGET OF LITHIUM NITRIDE (LI(3)N).

THE APPLICANT'S EXPERIENCE WITH PULSED SOURCES INDICATE THAT THE PFDS WILL BE MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE TO FABRICATE AND OPERATE THAN THE CYCLOTRONS NOW USED FOR THIS PURPOSE. THIS WILL ALLOW MUCH WIDER DISTRIBUTION OF THE RADIONUCLIDES REQUIRED FOR POSITRON-EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY (PET). THE AVAILABILITY OF A RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE SOURCE OF THESE RADIONUCLIDES WOULD RAPIDLY EXPAND THE USE OF PET IN MEDICAL CENTERS.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         THIS PROPOSAL DESCRIBES THE DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF A NEW TYPE OF POLARIMETER WHICH WE CALL A SINGLE APERTURE-FOUR CHANNEL OPTICAL POLARIMETER. IT IS DESIGNED TO MEASURE SIMULTANEOUSLY THE FOUR STOKES POLARIZATION PARAMETERS OF AN OPTICAL BEAM AND IS CAPABLE OF MEASURING THE STOKES PARAMETERS OF EITHER A CW OR PULSED OPTICAL BEAM. THE POLARIMETER IS READILY ADAPTED TO ELLIPSOMETRY AND IT IS TO THIS FIELD THAT WE APPLY THE POLARIMETER. WE SHOW THAT IF AN OPTICAL SURFACE (E.G., A DIELECTRIC FILM) IS ILLUMINATED WITH A SINGLE PULSE OF RIGHT OR LEFT CIRCULARLY POLARIZED LIGHT THEN THE ELLIPSOMETRIC PARAMETERS AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THE INDEX OF REFRACTION AND THE THICKNESS OF THE THIN-FILM CAN BE FOUND. THE TECHNICAL PORTION OF THE PROPOSED FIRST DISCUSSES THE CONCEPTUAL FOUNDATIONS FOR THE OPTICAL POLARIMETER FOR IT TO OPERATE AS AN ELLIPSOMETER. THIS IS FOLLOWED BY A DISCUSSION OF THE PROPOSED DESIGN AND ITS OPERATION. IN A FINAL SECTION WE PRESENT A DESCRIPTION OF THE REQUIRED SIGNAL PROCESSING OF THE FOUR CHANNELS.",

THIS STEP MUST BE IMPROVED BEFORE MANY DOMESTIC ORES CAN BE ECONOMICALLY EXPLOITED. SOLVENT EXTRACTION USING LIQUID ION EXCHANGE REAGENTS IS A WIDELY USED METHOD OF TREATING THESE HYDROMETALLURGICAL SOLUTIONS. WE PROPOSE TO MICROENCAPSULATE THESE REAGENTS. THESE MICROENCAPSULATED REAGENTS ALLOW A NUMBER OF INNOVATIONS TO BE MADE IN SOLVENT EXTRACTION PROCESSES. COST REDUCTIONS BECAUSE OF THE LOWER ION EXCHANGE REAGENT INVENTORY, LOWER EQUIPMENT COSTS, REDUCED ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN EMULSIFYING AND DEEMULSIFYING THE REAGENT, ELIMINATION OF FEED SOLUTION PREFILTRATION AND CLARIFICATION OPERATIONS, AND REDUCED REAGENT LOSS WITH THE AQUEOUS RAFFINATE SOLUTION COULD BE ACHIEVED WITH THESE REAGENTS.",

THE INVESTIGATOR PROPOSES TO EXTEND INVESTIGATIONS TO ASSESS DOSE AND SCHEDULE DEPENDENCE AND INTERACTION AND/OR SYNERGISM WITH DOXORUBICIN AND CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE IN EARLY ANDADVANCED L1210 AND SOME SOLID TUMOR MODEL SYSTEMS SUCH AS CD8F(1) MAMMARY TUMOR, B16 MELANOMA AND LEWIS LUNG CARCINOMA. SELECTED SECOND GENERATION COMPOUNDS IN THIS CHEMICAL SERIES WILL BE TESTED FOR TOXICITY, ANTITUMOR ACTIVITY, FREE RADICAL SCAVENGING ACTIVITY AND SYNERGISM WITH DOXORUBICIN AND CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE. THE RATIONALE FOR CARRYING OUT INVESTIGATIONS TO EVALUATE INTERACTION OF THESECOMPOUNDS ARE MOST EFFECTIVE AS FREE RADICAL SCAVENGERS THANAS METAL CHELATORS. SINCE ANTHRAQUINONE ANTICANCER DRUG METABOLISM IN THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM IS MEDIATED VIA THE FORMATION OF FREE RADICALS THAT ARE CAPABLE OF CAUSING TISSUE DAMAGE, ESPECIALLY THAT OF THE CARDIAC TISSUE, IT IS HOPED THAT FREE RADICAL SCAVENGERS MAY AMELIORATE THE CARDIOTOXICITY OF THESE AGENTS.",

SUCCESS IN THIS EFFORT WOULDELIMINATE THE NEED TO USE INVERTERS AND LOCAL POWER SUPPLIESAT NUMEROUS LOCATIONS IN A DISTRIBUTED MULTITERMINAL NETWORK. HYDRAULIC SYSTEMS COULD BE REPLACED BY SMALL ELECTRIC MOTORS WHICH OPERATE AT HIGH FREQUENCY CONSUMING HIGH POWER AC. LOCAL FREQUENCY DIVIDERS COULD BE USED FOR VARIOUS LOADS AS NEEDED. (LARGE AC TO DC POWER INVERTERS ARE ELIMINATED COMPLETELY). MOTORS WITH MORE THAN 3 POLES COULD BE USED. IN THIS CONCEPT, A LOW LEVEL OSCILLATOR WOULD MODULATE EACH LINEAR AMPLIFIER TO PRODUCE EACH PHASE AT ANY PHASE AT ANY SELECTED FREQUENCY UP TO 50 KHZ. MINIATURE HIGH FREQUENCY POWER TRANSFORMERS REDUCE AC VOLTAGES FOR LOADS AS NEEDED. TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF THE PROPOSED INNOVATION, TWO ENGINEERING MODELS WILL BE BUILT AND TESTED FOR THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTICS: ENGINEERING MODEL 1 - 170 VAC @ 85 AMPS DC TO 50 KHZ AT 50 V/USEC. ENGINEERING MODEL 2 - 230 VAC @ 110 AMPS DC TO 50 KHZ V/USEC. TOTAL STABILITY ON REACTIVE LOADS UP TO 50 KHZ.TRANSIENT RECOVERY FROM OVERLOAD LESS THAN 1 USEC.

THE DEVICE USES PRINCIPLES OF OPTICS, WHICH HAVE SUCCESSFULLY BEEN APPLIED TO OTHER APPLICATIONS. THE PROPOSED SENSOR WILL NOTBE SENSITIVE TO ELECTRICAL NOISE, THERMAL SHOCK AND SIGNAL DRIFT, WHICH OFTEN TEND TO SEVERELY DEGRADE THE PERFORMANCE OF TRANSDUCERS IN COMMON USE, SUCH AS PIEZOELECTRIC AND STRAIN GAUGE TYPES. FURTHERMORE, THE PROPOSED SENSOR HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR MASS PRODUCTION FOR THE GENERAL MARKET AT MOST REASONABLE PRICES. SUCH A TRANSDUCER WOULD SERVE AS ANEXCELLENT RESEARCH TOOL, BUT PERHAPS EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY PERMIT THE MEASUREMENT OF CYLINDER PRESSURE OF CONSUMER VEHICLES. THIS INFORMATION WOULD HAVE EXTREMELY BENEFICIAL RESULTS IMPROVING FUEL ECONOMY AND CONTROLLING EMISSIONS, SINCE A GOOD CYLINDER PRESSURE SENSOR IS TANTAMOUNT FOR EFFECTIVE CLOSED-LOOP ENGINE CONTROL. THE USE OF SUCH CONTROLS WILL BECOME ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT AS FUEL QUALITY DECLINES (LOWER OCTANE) IN THE FUTURE, SINCE THE USE OF SUCHFUELS WILL NECESSITATE CLOSER ENGINE MONITORING IN ORDER TO PREVENT MISFIRE, KNOCK AND OTHER SIMILAR PROBLEMS.",

CURRENTLY, ONLY DESTRUCTIVE TECHNIQUES ARE AVAILABLE USING SMALL SURVEILLANCE SAMPLES EXPOSED WITHIN A REACTOR. THE PRIMARY METHOD IS MAGNETOMECHANICAL ACOUSTICEMISSION, SUPPLEMENTED BY MAGNETIC AND EDDY CURRENT TESTING METHODS. DATA ACQUISITION WILL BE COMPUTERIZED AND PROCESSED FOR MUTUAL CORRELATION. INITIALLY, THERMAL DAMAGES ARE ANALYZED FOLLOWED BY MEASUREMENTS ON IRRADIATED SAMPLES. IN THE STUDY, ACOUSTIC SIGNALS IN THE RANGE OF 30 KHZ TO 2 MHZ WILL BE EXHAUSTIVELY ANALYZED IN RELATION TO APPLIED ALTERNATING MAGNETIC FIELDS BELOW 60 HZ. SUBMICROSCOPIC DAMAGES ARE EXPECTED TO INTERACT WITH MAGNETIC DOMAINS AND AFFECT THE GENERATION OF ACOUSTIC SIGNALS.",

AN EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM IS CONDUCTED TO DEMONSTRATE THIS CONCEPT AND ITS POTENTIAL FOR OPERATION IN ORBIT PUMPED BY THE SUN. OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE OF A LASER BASED ON THIS CONCEPT SHOULD BE ACHIEVED IN A LARGE HIGH POWER SYSTEM.

A RESEARCH PROGRAM IS PROPOSED TO IDENTIFY AND ASSESS MAJOR DATA DISCREPANCIES ARISING FROM IMPORTANT MATRIX EFFECTS IN THESE MATERIAL STREAMS (E.G., VARYING MOISTURE CONTENT AND STRONG NEUTRON ASORBERS). THESE MATRIX EFECTS CAN ALTER NEUTRON SCATTERING,MODERATION, ABSORPTION PROCESSES AND CAPTURE GAMMA RAY ATTENUATION AND THEREBY SERIOUSLY AFFECT ACCURACY AND RESOLUTION OF THE DATA. HOWEVER, WITH THE PROPER DEVELOPMENTAND APPLICATION OF EXISTING THEORY, COMPUTER CODES, AND NEUTRON CROSS SECTIONAL DATA IT IS PROPOSED THAT AN ADEQUATE, BUT SIMPLE MODEL CAN BE DEVELOPED TO CORRECT THESESIGNIFICANT MATRIX EFFECTS AND ENHANCE APPLICATIONS FOR CONTINUOUS, ON LINE MATERIAL STREAM CONTROL.

SA TAKES AS INPUT SPECIFIC TASK SOLUTIONS GENERATED BY EXPERTS AND GENERATES PSYCHOLOGICALLY RELEVANT PROCEDURAL SPECIFICATIONS (FOR GIVEN CLASSES OF TASKS). THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS DESIGNED TO FULLY AUTOMATE SA AND TO INTERGRATE IT WITH THE GENERAL PURPOSE RULETUTOR. MORE SPECIFICALLY, WE PROPOSE TO USE THE RULETUTOR AS A BASIS FORAN ENTIRE CLASS OF PERFORMANCE AIDS AND INDIVIDUALIZED TRAINING SYSTEMS. THE MAJOR EFFORT WILL GO INTO AUTOMATING THE PROCESS OF SA AND DEVELOPING A VERY HIGH LEVEL RULE-ORIENTED LANGUAGE WHICH WILL TAKE THE RESULTS OF SA (I.E., PSYCHOLOGICALLY RELEVANT RULES AND RULE COMPONENTS) AND AUTOMATICALLY GENERATE (LOWER-LEVEL LANGUAGE) SOFTWARE CODE (E.G. PASCAL OR EVEN BASIC) AND INTEGRATE IT INTO THE GENERAL PURPOSE RULETUTOR.",

PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN PREGELANTINIZED STARCH TO BE EFFECTIVE IN THE SYMPTOMATIC TREATMENT OF COMMON DIARRHEA IN NEONATAL CALVES, AND SHULCON INDUSTRIES INC. NOW MARKETS A PRODUCT IN CANADA FOR THAT PURPOSE. THISPROGRAM WILL EXTEND THE ANTIDIARRHEAL APPLICATION OF PREGELANTINIZED STARCH TO A SECOND, MONOGASTRIC, ANIMAL SPECIES LEADING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ANTIDIARRHEAL DRUG APPLICABLE TO HUMAN INFANTS. THE PHASE I PROGRAM WILL ESTABLISH THE EFFICACY OF PREGELATINIZED STARCH IN TREATING SPECIFIC ACUTE NEONATAL PIG DIARRHEA AS A MODEL FOR THE HUMAN INFANTILE DISEASE. SELECTED STRAINS OF ENTEROTOXIGENIC \"E. COLI\" WITH DIFFERENING PILUS ANTIGENS WILL BE EMPLOYED INDEPENDENTLY TO CHALLENGE NEWBORN PIGS FROM NON-IMMUNIZED GILTS TO PRODUCT DIARRHEAL DISEASE. DIARRHEIC PIGS WILL BE ASSIGNED RANDOMLY TO TREATMENT OR PLACEBO GROUPS IN A DOUBLE BLIND DESIGN, TREATED ACCORDINGLYAND OBSERVED FOR UP TO SEVEN DAYS. FORM OF STOOL AND AND FREQUENCY OF DEFECATION WILL BE MONITORED TO ESTABLISH THE DURATION OF DIARRHEA. BODY WEIGHT AND CLINICAL HYDRATION STATE WILL BE DETERMINED DAILY AS INDEPENDENT MEASURES OF THE EFFECT OF THE THERAPEUTIC METHOD. RANDOMLY SELECTED PIGS WILL BE SACRIFICED ONE DAY AFTER COMPLETION OF THE THERAPEUTIC SERIES AND THE SIZES OF THE POPULATIONS OF THE CHALLENGE STRAIN ADHERING TO THE INTESTINAL MUCOSA WILL BE DETERMINED. HISTOCHEMICAL EXAMINATION OF SECTIONS FROM SEGMENTS OF THE SMALL INTESTINE WILL EVALUATE THE PASSAGE AND LOCUS OF STARCH THROUGHOUT THAT ORGAN. NECROPSIES WILL BE PERFORMED ON ALL PIGS THAT DIE DURING THESTUDY. THE OUTPUT OF THE STUDY WILL BE A MEASURE OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PREGELATINIZED STARCH IN ARRESTING SPECIFICACUTE DIARRHEA OF NEONATAL PIGS DUE TO SEVERAL PILIATED TYPES OF \"E.COLI\" AND WILL DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF PROCEEDING TO MORE COMPLETE PRE-CLINICAL STUDIES TO ESTABLISH MECHANISTICS AND ANIMAL SAFETY PRIOR TO PHASE I CLINICAL STUDIES IN HUMANS.",

THE MODEL WILL BE IMPLEMENTED ON A CDC CYBER 205 SUPERCOMPUTER WHICH HAS THE SIZE AND SPEED NECESSARY TO MAKETHIS APPROACH A REALITY. PHASE I OF THE PROJECT WILL BE TO CONSTRUCT THE MODEL CODE AND TEST ITS FEASIBILITY THROUGH COMPUTATION TIME COMPARISONS. THE CODE WILL BE WRITTEN TO INCLUDE INHOMOGENEITY AND ANISOTROPY OF THE MEDIA, AND FORMULATED SO THAT SOURCE AND SINK TERMS IN THE TRANSPORT EQUATION MAY LATER BE INCLUDED. IF THE EXPECTED TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE INCREASE IN SPEED IS ACHIEVED, THE APPROACH WILL BE ASSUMED FEASIBLE. PHASE II EFFORTS WILL THEN BE DIRECTED AT USING THE MODEL TO CHARACTERIZE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROCESSES UNIQUE TO TRANSPORT IN UNSATURATED FLOW.",

BECAUSE DEFECTS CAN ELIMINATE THE INITIAL STAGE OF CRACK GROWTH, THE FATIGUE LIFE IS GREATLY REDUCED, ESPECIALLY IF FRACTURE IS CONTROLLED BY CRACK INITIATION. THEREFORE, THE FATIGUE CRACK GROWTH PROCESS IS REDUCE TO CRACK PROPAGATION AND UNSTABLE CRACK GROWTH. FATIGUE STUDIES INDICATE THAT WELDED COMPONENTS IN BRIDGES ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO FATIGUE FRACTURE THAN GIRDERS OR TRUSSES. DEFECTS FORMED DURING THE WELDING PROCESS ACT AS STRESS RISERS TO DEVELOP HIGH STRESS FIELDS WHICH LEAD TO MICROCRACKS AND SUBSEQUENT FAILURE UNDER CYLIC LOADING. SINCE CURRENT NOT TECHINIQUES FOR LOCATING CRACKS IN BRIDGES REQUIRE CONTACT AND SINCE MANY WELDED JOINTS ARE DIFFICULT TO INSPECT BECAUSES OF THE LOCATION, A TECHNIQUE WHICH WOULD BE NONCONTRACTING AND SIMPLY OPERATED IN FIELD ANALYSES UNDER TYPICAL, WORKING ENVIRONMENTS COULD SIMPLIFY THE ANALYSIS. THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL INVESTIGATE THE FACTORS NECESSARY TO DEVELOP A NEW AND INNOVATIVE TECHNIQUE USING INFRARED THERMOGRAPHY TO LOCATE CRACK PROPAGATION ZONES IN WELDED COMPONENTS.",

SPECIFICALLY, IT PROPOSES TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF FABRICATING ESSENTIALLY SINGLE-CRYSTAL SILICON FILMS WITH BACK-SURFACE MIRRORS FOR OPTICAL CONFINEMENT BY MEANS OF THREE-DIMENSIONAL GRAPHOEPITAXY. THE APPROACH COMPRISES THREE STEPS. FIRST, SURFACE RELIEF STRUCTURES COMPATIBLE BOTH WITH THE STABLE, OCTAHEDRAL GROWTH MORPHOLOGY AND THE (100) FILM ORIENTATION ARE TO BE REPLICATED BY DEPOSITING REFRACTORY METAL FILMS UPON TEXTUREETCHED (100) SILICON SURFACES. THIS CIRCUMVENTS BOTH THE HIGH COST AND THE GEOMETRIC LIMITATIONS OF THE PHOTOLITHOGRAPHICALLY DEFINED 1- AND 2-DIMENSIONAL GRATINGS NOW USED. THE SECOND STEP IS THE DEPOSITION OF SILICON FILMS UPON THE METAL REPLICATES, FOLLOWED BY THE DEPOSITION OF PROTECTIVE OXIDE/NITRIDE OVERLAYERS. THIRD, THE AS-DEPOSITED SILICON FILMS ARE TO BE CRYSTALLIZED BY SCANNEDSTRIP HEATING AND BY PULSED ELECTRON BEAM HEATING. THE CRYSTALLOGRAPHICALLY DEFINED THREE-DIMENSIONAL RELIEF PROVIDED BY THE METAL REPLICATE IS EXPECTED TO INDUCE TRUE SINGLE-CRYSTALLINITY, RATHER THAN THE LARGE-GRAIN CRYSTAL MOSAICS OBTAINED TO DATE. EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT, THE METAL REPLICATE REMAINS AS AN INTEGRAL FACETED BACK-SURFACE MIRRORTO BE USED FOR OPTICAL CONFINEMENT.",

THESE CBN COATINGS WERE NEARLY ASHARD AS DIAMONDS, SCRATCH RESISTANT, AND TRANSPARENT TO THE NAKED EYE. THE COATING WAS SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED TO PYREX GLASS. THE RESEARCH PROPOSED HERE WOULD USE THE ORIGINAL APPARATUS TO DEPOSIT CBN COATINGS ON MATERIALS TYPICALLY USED FOR OPTICAL TELESCOPES, SUCH AS ALUMINUM OR SILVER EVAPORATED ONTO GLASS. THE OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF THESE COATINGS WOULD BE MEASURED TO DETERMINE SCRATCH RESISTANCE. IF THIN CUBIC BORON-NITRIDE COATINGS PROVE FEASIBLE FOR HIGHQUALITY OPTICS, IN THAT THEY DO NOT DEGRADE THE SURFACE AND PROVIDE A SCRATCH RESISTANT SEAL AGAINST CHEMICAL DEGRADATION, THEN LARGE MIRRORS COULD BE COATED IN THE APPARATUS NOW BEING DESIGNED FOR TOOL BITS UNDER PHASE II OF THE EARLIER NSF PROGRAM.",

ONCE A PRACTICAL SYNTHETIC ROUTE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED, WE WILL INVESTIGATE ITS POTENTIAL FOR SCALE UP AS WELL AS THE CONVERSION OF HBED INTO THE CORRESPONDING METHYL ESTER (DMHBED), THE MOST ACTIVE DERIVATIVE OF HBED. THE HBED PREPARED IN THE COURSE OF THESE PILOT INVESTIGATIONS WILL BE USED IN PRELIMINARY SHORT TERM FEEDING STUDIES INVOLVING MICE AND RATS. THESE STUDIES WILL SERVE AS A GUIDE FOR DETERMINING THE SCOPE OF SUBSEQUENT TOXICITY EVALUATIONS. ASSUMING THAT THE RESULTS OF THE PHASE I STUDIES LOOK PROMISING, A PHASE II APPLICATION WILL BE SUBMITTED DEALING WITH THE SCALE UP AND MANUFACTURE OF HBED AND DMHBED FOR USE IN CHRONIC TOXICITY STUDIES AND CLINICAL EVALUATION.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         TO AVOID BECOMING EXTINCT IN THE UNITED STATES THE GARMENT MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY MUST REPLACE ITS PRESENT LABOR INTENSIVE, PIECEMEAL, CUT AND SEW PROCEDURES BY AUTOMATED SYSTEMS METHODS. ONE OF THE MORE PROMISING APPROACHES INVOLVES THE MANUFACTURE OF CLOTHING FROM THERMOPLASTIC FABRICS SUCH AS ACETATE, NYLON, POLYESTER, ETC. BY MEANS OF HEAT FORMING, HEAT BONDING AND ULTRASONIC BONDING TECHNIQUES. THESE PROCEDURES COULD BE READILY IMPLEMENTED VIA AN AUTOMATED PRODUCTION LINE PROCESS USING ROBOTIC TECHNOLOGY. THE PURPOSE OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO OBTAIN REALIABEL QUANTITATIVE DATA REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE, PRESSURE AND TIME UPON THE MOLDING / BONDING CHARACTERISTICS OF SEVERAL OF THE MORE WIDELY USED THERMO- PLASTIC FABRICS. EACH FABRIC WOULD HAVE TO BE TESTED ON SEVERAL MOLD SHAPES (CUP, SHOULDER CONTOUR, CREASE) REPRESENTING STANDARD CLOTHING CONTOURS. THE RESULTS OF A BACKGROUND STUDY CONDUCTED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI BY THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR HAS CONFIRMED THE POTENTIAL OF THESE METHODS AND JUSTIFIED THE FORMAL INVESTIGATION PROPOSED HEREIN.

IT IS PROPOSED THAT THESE RESULTS BE USED AS A BASIS FOR THEDEVELOPMENT OF A MATHEMATICAL MODEL WHICH RELATES THE RELEVANT OUTPUT PARAMETERS OF THE PROBLEM (EG., FLOW RATES, CONCENTRATION PROFILES) TO THE GIVEN VENTING CONDITIONS (EG., SOIL CONDITIONS, DEPTH OF WATER TABLE, BOUNDARY CONDITIONS). THE MODEL WILL BE DEVELOPED FROM THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS FOR DIFFUSION AND FLOW THROUGH POROUS MEDIA. PROVEN NUMERICAL METHODS WILL BE EMPLOYED TO SOLVE THE EQUATIONS FOR THE VARIETY OF CONDITIONS ENCOUNTERED IN FIELD VENTING APPLICATIONS. REFINEMENTS TO THE MODEL WILL BE MADE ON THE BASIS OF COMPARISONS BETWEEN PREDICTED AND MEASURED CONCENTRATION PROFILES. THE GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO PRODUCE A TRACTABLE MODEL WHICH CAN PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF A VARIETY OF VENTING DESIGNS FOR CONTROLLING VAPORS EMITTED BY UNDERGROUND SPILLAGE OF TOXIC MATERIALS.",

SUCH INFORMATION WOULD PROVIDE CLUES AS TO WHETHER THE DETONATION WAS NUCLEAR OR NON-NUCLEAR, PURPOSE AND SOPHITICATION OF THE DETONATIONG DEVICE AND ALSO THE IDENTITY OF THE TESTING NATION. THIS ALGORITHMIC DESIGN WILL INVOLVE THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOME NEW ALGORITHMS FROM EXISTING THEORY, THE ADAPTATION OF EXISTING ALGORITHMS AND THE INTEGRATION OF THESE ALGORITHMIC COMPONENTS INTO A SINGLE, COHERENT UNIT. IT WILL ALSO INVOLVE THE ESTIMATION OF THE POTENTIAL ACCURACY OF AN IMPLEMENTED SYSTEM.

COMMERCIALIZATION WILL ENTAIL A SERVICE WHICH MEASURES THE DNA-ADDUCT BURDEN IN INDIVIDUALS.THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PHASE I RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP AND DEMONSTRATE AN ASSAY SYSTEM THAT IS CAPABLE OF MEASURING IN HUMANS THE DNA ADDUCTS OF THE PREVALENT CHEMICAL CARCINOGEN,BENZO(A)PYRENE (B(A)P). B(A)P BECOMES MUTAGENIC AND CARCINOGENIC AFTER METABOLIC ACTIVATION. THE COVALENT BINDING OF THE ACTIVATED METABOLITE TO CELLULAR DNA IS CONSIDERED TO BE AN IMPORTANT STEP IN THE INITIATION OF MALIGNANT TRANSFORMATION. IF THESE COVALENT ADDUCTS TO DNA CAN BE DIRECTLY MONITORED IN PEOPLE AT RISK TO CARCINOGEN EXPOSURE, ACTIONS CAN BE TAKEN TO PREVENT FURTHEREXPOSURE AND POSSIBLY AVOID THE INDUCTION OF CANCER AT A OF BIFUNCTIONAL REAGENTS (EDTA-PH-B[OH]2) CONTAINING A POWERFUL METAL CHELATING EDTA MOIETY LINKED TO GROUP THAT REACTS WITH THE CIS-8, 9-DIHYDRODIOL PORTION OF THE GUANOSINE ADDUCT (BPDE-DG) OF A B(A)P METABOLITE. BLOOD (10 ML) IS DRAWN FROM B(A)P EXPOSED HUMANS, LYMPHOCYTES ARE SEPARATED, AND DNA IS EXTRACTED AND ENZYMATICALLY HYDROLYSEDTO NUCLEOSIDES BY CONVENTIONAL METHODS. THE EDTA-PH-B(OH)2 IS COMPLEXED WITH A SHORT-LIVED METAL ISOTOPE (E.G.(111)IN, (99)TC) AND THEN CONDENSED WITH THE BPDE-DG TO FORM A CYCLICBORONATE ESTER. THE STABLE COMPLEX OF THE RADIOACTIVE METALEDTA-PH(OH)2 - BPDE-DG IS CHROMATOGRAPHICALLY SEPARATED FROMOTHER IMPURITIES AND DETECTED. WITH A DETECTABILITY CRITERION OF 100 DPM, 5 X 10(4) MOLECULES OF THE DNA ADDUCT CAN BE DETECTED IF (99)TC IS USED. THE GOAL OF THE PHASE I RESEARCH IS TO ATTAIN A DETECTABILITY LEVEL OF 10(7) MOLECULES SO THAT ONE B(A)P ADDUCT CAN BE DETECTED PER CELL FROM 10 ML OF BLOOD. WHEN THE CHEMICAL ASSAY IS DEMONSTRATED \"IN VITRO\", IT WILL BE USED TO MEASURE THE ADDUCTS IN BLOOD SAMPLES DRAWN FROM TWO COKE OVEN WORKERS. EPIDEMIOLOGY STUDIES CORRELATING THE ADDUCT BURDEN WITH CUMULATION OCCUPATION DOSE WILL BE CONDUCTED IN PHASE II.",

PHASE I IS A PROOF OF CONCEPT STUDY DESIGNED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT A VESICLE FORMULATION KNOWN TO AGGRESSIVELY TARGET TO MACROPHAGE IN VITRO CAN EVOKE STRONG MACROPHAGE MEDIATED IMMUNE RESPONSES TO OTHERWISE WEAK OR NONIMMUNOGENIC HAPTEN CONJUGATES IN VIVO. PHASE I EXPERIMENTS SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THE MACROPHAGE MEDIATED B-CELL RESPONSE AND ARE DESIGNED TO DETERMINE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SIZE OF THE HAPTEN CARRIER WHEN TARGETED WITH VESICLES. PHASE I SHOULD SUGGEST ANSWERS TO THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: 1) IS AN ENDOCYTOSED VESICLE PROCESSED AS AN IMMUNOGEN BEFORE OR AFTER LYSIS BY MACROPHAGE? 2) ARE LYSOZOME LABILE CARRIERS PROCESSED AS ANTIGENS OR DEGRADED WHEN ENDOCYTOSED WITHIN TARGETED VESICLES? 3) ARE HAPTEN-CONJUGATES, TARGETED TO MACROPHAGE BY VESICLE ENCAPSULATION, IMMUNOGENIC AT LOWER DOSAGES THAN CONVENTIONALLY INTRODUCED HAPTEN-CONJUGATES? SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF PHASE I WILL DEMONSTRATE THAT IMMUNE RESPONSE CAN BE ALTERED BY PRESENTING CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES TO SPECIFIC CELLS IN A MICROENCAPSULATED FORMULATION. PHASE II WILL EXTEND THIS PRELIMINARY INVES- TIGATION OF DELIVERING HAPTEN-CONJUGATE FORMULATIONS TO MACROPHAGE TO INCORPORATE HELPER T-CELL PARTICIPATION IN THEINITIAL ANTICIPATED T-CELL INDEPENDENT RESPONSE.

THE TECHNOLOGY, WHICH INVOLVES ISOLATINGA GENE SEQUENCE OF INTEREST FROM ONE ORGANISM AND MANIPULATING THE SEQUENCE IN A VECTOR INTO ANOTHER ORGANISM,DOES NOT HAVE RAPID AND EFFICIENT MEANS OF ISOLATING PURE DNA MOLECULES GREATER THAN 40 BASE PAIRS IN LENGTH. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PHASE I RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP HIGH PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY (HPLC) COLUMNS THAT WILL SEPARATE DNA MOLECULES BY AFFINITY CHROMATOGRAPHY. AROMATIC DYE MOLECULES KNOWN TO RAPIDLY AND REVERSIBLY BIND TO DNA WILL BE LINKED BY LONG HYDROPHILIC CHAINS TO HPLC QUALITY SILICA GEL. THE NUMBER OF DYE MOLECULES LINKED TO THE SILICA SURFACE WILL BE QUANTIFIED BY THE PRESENCE OF RADIOLABELS INCORPORATED IN THE LINKER CHAINS. THE DERIVATIZED SILICA GELS WILL BE PACKED INTO HPLC COLUMNS ANDWILL BE EVALUATED FOR THEIR ABILITY TO CHROMATOGRAPHICALLY RESOLVE VARIOUS SIZE DNA RESTRICTION FRAGMENTS. CHROMATO- GRAPHIC VARIABLES TO BE INVESTIGATED WILL INCLUDE TYPE AND PERCENT ORGANIC MODIFIER SOLVENT, IONIC STRENGTH AND TEMPERATURE OF THE MOBILE PHASE. THE SILICA GEL DERIVATIVES WILL BE VARIED IN THE FOLLOWING PARAMETERS: IDENTITY OF DYE AFFINITY PROBE, LENGTH OF THE LINKER CHAIN TO THE SILICA SURFACE, DENSITY OF DYE MOLECULES ON THE SURFACE, AND THE CAPPING OF THE SILICA BEAD SURFACE WITH HYDROPHOBIC OR HYDROPHILIC FUNCTINAL GROUPS.

COMPLETION OF PHASE II AND III FOLLOWING PHASE I INVESTIGATIONS PROPOSED HERE WILL RESULT IN A COMPLETE VIDEO ACQUISITION, PROCESSING, REVIEW AND ARCHIVING SYSTEM FOR CLINICAL OPHTHALMOLOGY, AND A LOW COST IMAGE ACQUISITION AND PROCESSING SYSTEM FOR USE IN PRIVATE OPHTHALMOLOGY PRACTICES. WHILE PARTS OF SUCH A SYSTEM HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED BY OTHERS IN THE PAST, IT IS PAR TECHNOLOGY'S BELIEF THAT RECENT ADVANCES IN COMPUTER AND IMAGE PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY, PLUS THE COMPANY'S BROAD EXPERIENCE IN BUILDING IMAGE PROCESSING SYSTEMS, WILL FOR THE FIRST TIME BRING THESE TECHNOLOGIES TOGETHER IN A COMMERCIALLY VIABLE PRODUCT. THE PROPOSED STUDY INVOLVES APPLICATION OF IMAGE ACQUISITION/STORAGE DEVICES AND PROCESSING ALGORITHMS TO BOTH TEST PATTERNS AND RETINAL IMAGES (35MM SLIDES), AND QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVALUATION OF RESULTS BY IMAGE SCIENTISTS AND OPHTHALMOLOGISTS. EXPECTED RESULTS INCLUDE SPECIFICATIONS WHICH ACQUISITION, DISPLAY, AND STORAGE DEVICES MUST MEET IN ORDER TO BE CLINICALLY USEFUL; ANALYSES OF CAPABILITIES AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF CURRENTLY-AVAILABLE DEVICES; AND DEFINITION OF A SUITE OF IMAGE ENHANCEMENT AND PROCESSING ALGORITHMS WHICH CAN IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF ANGIOGRAMS COLLECTED THROUGH CLOUDY MEDIA AND AUTOMATICALLY DETECT AND ANALYZE VARIOUS TYPES OF RETINAL ABNORMALITIES. COMPUTER ACQUISITION, PROCESSING, AND ARCHIVING OF ANGIOGRAMS CAN PROVIDE FOR IMMEDIATE REVIEW OF COLLECTED IMAGERY, RESULTINGIN IMPROVED IMAGE QUALITY AND POSSIBLY ALLOWING LESS SKILLEDPERSONNEL TO PERFORM THE ACQUISITION. ANGIOGRAMS CAN BE COLLECTED WITH LOWER LEVELS OF ILLUMINATION THAN CURRENTLY USED FOR FILM, REDUCING RISK. NEW HIGH DENSITY VIDEO GREATLY REDUCE RETRIEVAL TIME OF PATIENT DATA. IMAGE PROCESSING ALGORITHMS COULD IMPROVE THE DIAGNOSTIC VALUE OF FLUORESCEIN ANGIOGRAMS.",

IN THE CASE OF URANIUM MILL TAILINGS A CLAY CAP UP TO SIX FEET THICK IS APPLIED TO PREVENT ESCAPE OF RADIOACTIVE RADON GAS. IN ARID AREAS WHERE VEGETATION IS DIFFICULT TO ESTABLISH, A ROCK MULCH OR GRAVEL ARMOR MAY BE PLACED ON THE CLAY TO PREVENT EROSIONBY WIND AND RAIN. NATURAL TALUS SLOPES PROVIDE AN EXCELLENTPHYSICAL ANALOG TO THIS ARRANGEMENT OF MATERIALS AND STUDIESSHOW THE HYDROLOGICAL AND EROSIONAL RESPONSE OF TALUS MAY DEPEND UPON THE NATURE AND DISTRIBUTION OF FINE MATERIAL BENEATH THE ROCK COVER. THE RESULTS (SOSEDOV, 1974; YAIR AND LAVEE, 1976) INDICATE THAT TALUS CAN BE EITHER VERY STABLE OR HIGHLY ERODIBLE DUE TO REMOVAL OF FINE MATERIAL BY SUBSURFACE FLOW. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THIS FLOW CAN OCCUR ALONG THE INTERFACE BETWEEN THE ROCK COVER AND THE UNDERLYING FINE MATERIAL. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS DESIGNEDTO INVESTIGATE EXPERIMENTALLY THE NATURE OF SUBSURFACE RUNOFF GENERATION AND EROSION PROCESSES ON ROCK MULCH AND UNDERLYING SURFACES. DURING PHASE I, LABORATORY EXPERIMENTSWILL DETERMINE WHICH CHARACTERISTICS OF ROCK MULCH ARE IMPORTANT IN RUNOFF GENERATION AND SUBSURFACE EROSION. PHASE II WILL EXTEND THE STUDY TO A FIELD SITE, LOCATED ON URANIUM MILL TAILINGS IN WESTERN COLORADO, WHERE TEST PLOTS OF THE BEST AND WORST CASES, AS DETERMINED BY PHASE I,WILL BE EXAMINED USING A PORTABLE RAINFALL SIMULATOR.

INSECT VISION IS FUNDEMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM HUMAN VISION IN THAT IS GOVERNED BY MULTIAPERATURE OPTICS. WHILE INSECT EYES HAVE LOWER FORM OF HARWARE STRUCTURE, SOPHISTICATED SOFTWARE PROVIDES INSECTS THE THREE FUNCTIONS REQUIRED IN ANY VISION SYSTEM: TO VERIFYTHE PRESENCE OF AN OBJECT, TO MEASURE IMAGE FEATURES, AND TORECOGNIZE OBJECTS. ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THE SUCCESS OF INSECTS IN SURVIVAL COMPETITION IS THEIR ACUTE VISION.IT CAN BE SHOWN THAT IN MOST INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS, GREAT DETAIL OF IMAGE IS NOT ONLY UNNECESSARY, BUT ALSO BECOMES INFORMATION NOISE IN IMAGE PROCESSING. IN INSECT VISION SYSTEM, THE INFORMATION IS PROCESSED IN NERVE NETS WITHIN THEIR EYES. ONLY THE RESULT OF THE COMPUTATION, SUCH AS PATTERN OR SPEED OF THE TARGET IS SENT TO THE BRAIN.

THE MMW SATCOM SYSTEMS REQUIRE A WIDE IF BANDWIDTH, EITHER TO ACCOMODATE HIGH DATA RATES OR TO PROVIDE FOR JAM-RESISTANCE THROUGH USE OF WIDEBAND FREQUENCY HOPPING AND/OR SPREAD SPECTRUM TECHNIQUES.

THE OBJECTIVESOF THE PHASE I PROGRAM ARE TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY AND ANALYZE THE PERFORMANCE OF AN RF GENERATOR COMPRISING LASER SOURCE, PHOTOCATHODE, AND KLYSTRON CAVITY AND TO DESIGN AN EXPERIMENT TO TEST THE COUPLED SYSTEM. THE DESIGN IS TO BE SUFFICIENTLY COMPLETE TO ASSEMBLE A DEMONSTRATION EXPERIMENTIN PHASE II. USING A PHOTOCATHODE FOR HIGH POWER RF GENERATION IS A WRC CONCEPT THAT ALLOWS A HIGH CURRENT ELECTRON BEAM TO BE BUNCHED AT LOW ENERGY AND AT HIGH FREQUENCY BY IRRADIATING THE PHOTOCATHODE SURFACE WITH A SHORT PULSE, MODE-LOCKED LASER. THE BUNCHED BEAM, AFTER ACCELERATION BY A CONVENTIONAL PULSED POWER DIODE, CAN BE RADIALLY FOCUSED AND DECELERATED IN A KLYSTRON CAVITY TO PRODUCE RF. HIGH POWER RF GENERATION BY PHOTOCATHODES CAN LEAD TO LOW CAPITAL AND OPERATING COST FOR FACILITIES INVOLVING VERY HIGH POWER AND/OR ENERGY LEVELS IN THE RANGE OF 50 MHZ TO ABOUT 3 GHZ.",
