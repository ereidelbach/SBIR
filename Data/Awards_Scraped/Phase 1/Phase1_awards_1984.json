IN ORDER FOR THESE PATTERNING TECHNIQUES TO BE USEFUL, THE DEFECT DENSITY OF THE FINAL PRODUCT MUST BE VERY TIGHTLY CONTROLLED AND EXTREMELY LOW (LESS THAN 0.5 PER SQ.IN). TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, SEVERAL APPROACHES WILL BE INVESTIGATED. THEY ARE: 1. PLASMA ASSISTED DEVELOPMENT OF THICK RESIST MATERIALS. IN THIS STEP RESIST FILMS WILL BE USED IN THE 6,000 TO 8,000 A RANGE, WET DEVELOPED AND THE PLASMA CLEANED TO REMOVE THE REMAINING RESIST MATERIAL. THE SOLVENT CHEMISTRY IS USED TO FORM A PARTIAL RELIEF IMAGE WHICH WILL THEN BE ENHANCED BY PLASMA TREATMENT. 2. VARIATIONS IN ACCELERATING VOLTAGE WILL BE INVESTIGATED TO PRODUCE HIGHER CONTRAST EXPOSURE. THESE PARAMETERS WILL BE FIRST MODELED THROUGH COMPUTER SIMULATION AND THEN PRODUCED IN RESIST AND CHECKED BY SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY ANALYSIS. 3. PRESENT SOLVENT CHEMISTRIES WILL BE MODIFIED TO BE MORE SELECTIVE TO LOWER MOLECULAR WEIGHT SPECIES, THEREBY PRODUCING HIGHER CONTRAST. CARE MUST BE TAKEN TO REDUCE SWELLING AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, WHILE MAINTAINING REASONABLE PROCESS TIMES. 4. EXISTING PROCESS EQUIPMENT WILL BE MODIFIED TO PRODUCE GREATER UNIFORMITY, BOTH IN DEVELOP AND ETCHING STEPS.",

FROM THESE IDENTIFIED SYSTEMS, A SELECTION WILL BE MADE OF THOSE COMPATIBLE FOR USE IN A MIXED SENSOR PROBE. THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY IS TO MINIMIZE THE NUMBER OF SEPARATE FIBERS REQUIRED TO MEET THE NEED FOR A LOW COST BLOOD GAS SENSING RADIAL ARTERY CATHETER. THIS STUDY HAS IMPLICATIONS IN BOTH IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF INTENSIVE CARE FOR CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY REDUCING COSTS THROUGH REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF CLINICAL LABORATORY TEST SAMPLES REQUIRED DURING THE COURSE OF TREATMENT. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT A COMMERCIAL MARKET FOR FULLY-SENSED RADIAL ARTERY CATHETERS COSTING UNDER $65 WILL APPROACH 1/4 MILLION UNITS WITHIN FIVE YEARS OF ITS INTRODUCTION.

THE PROPOSED PROGRAM HAS AS ITS OBJECTIVES PROOF OF FEASIBILITY OF A NOVEL X-RAY TECHNIQUE TO PERMIT BOTH MEASUREMENT AND CORRECTION OF THE ANGLES OF CUT OF DOUBLY ROTATED QUARTZ-CRYSTAL PLATES, SUCH AS THE SC, IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT, AND DELIVERY OF A CONCEPTUAL DESIGN FOR A COMPLETE ORIENTATION MEASUREMENT INSTRUMENT. FEASIBILITY WILL BE DETERMINED FROM CALCULATIONS AND FROM EXPERIMENTS UTILIZING MODIFICATIONS TO A PROTOTYPE LASER-ASSISTED LAUE DIFFRACTOMETER, AN INSTRUMENT SIMILAR IN GEOMETRY TO THAT PROPOSED.",

THESE INCLUDE THE RANDOM DECREMENT PROCESS TO OBTAIN THE FREE DECAY RESPONSE, THE TIME DOMAIN AND FREQUENCY DOMAIN CURVE FITTING PROCESS FOR THE DETERMINATION OF SYSTEM'S EIVENVALUES AND EIVENVECTORS. COMPUTER ALGORITHMS WILL BE DEVELOPED TO ACCOMMODATE ALL THESE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES. TO EVALUATE THE ACCURACY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SYSTEM IDENTIFICATION TECHNIQUE, EXPERIMENTS WILL BE PERFORMED ON A BONDED CANTILEVER BEAM.

IN PARTICULAR, IT HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR PROVIDING SENSITIVE DIAGNOSTIC REAGENTS TO RADIATION INDUCED CELL DAMAGE. WE HAVE RECENTLY CONDUCTED PRELIMINARY RESEARCH ON A NEW APPROACH, THE ELECTRONIC CELL FUSION TECHNIQUE. THIS TECHNIQUE USES AN ELECTRONIC IMPULSE TO PUNCTURE THE MEMBRANE AT THE POINT OF CELL CONTACT WHICH IMMEDIATELY INDUCES THE ONSET OF FUSION. THIS METHOD HAS THE POTENTIAL TO MAKE POSSIBLE THE SUCCESSFUL FUSION OF A WIDE VARIETY OF CELL PARTNERS NOT PREVIOUSLY ADDRESSABLE. RMD, INC. IN COLLABORATION WITH THE MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL PROPOSES TO DO THE RESEARCH NECESSARY TO DEVELOP A RELIABLE AND PRACTICAL TECHNIQUE FOR PRODUCING AN ANTIBODY DIAGNOSTIC ASSAY TECHNIQUE FOR QUANTIFYING RADIATION INDUCED DAMAGE. IN PHASE I WE WILL FOCUS ON RESEARCH TO DEMONSTRATE BOTH THE POTENTIAL STRENGTHS OF THE ELECTRONIC CELL FUSION TECHNIQUE WITH RESPECT TO HUMAN T-CELLS. IN PHASE II, WE WILL PERFECT THE TECHNIQUE AND FIRST MAKE THE REQUIRED SPECIFIC ANTI T-CELL ANTIBODIES.",

A PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF A WEARABLE PNEUMATIC SUPPLY HAS BEEN MADE. AIR IS SUPPLIED BY A MOTOR-DRIVEN PARTIAL EMISSION CENTRIFUGAL BLOWER. THE AIR FLOW IS CONTROLLED AND DIRECTED BY AN ELECTRICALLY PILOTED PNEUMATIC VALVE POWERED BY THE BLOWER OUTPUT PRESSURE. A PRELIMINARY LAYOUT OF A PACKAGE USING READILY AVAILABLE COMMERCIAL COMPONENTS HAS BEEN MADE. THE UNIT HAS SUFFICIENT BATTERY CAPACITY FOR OPERATION OF ONE HOUR OR MORE. THE TOTAL PACKAGE VOLUME IS 56 CU.IN. AND THE WEIGHT IS 3 LBS., OF WHICH HALF IS DUE TO THE BATTERIES. FIVE-HOUR OPERATION OR SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION IN SIZE AND WEIGHT IS ACHIEVED BY ADVANCED LITHIUM BATTERIES. THE WEARABLE AIR SUPPLY ALSO CAN BE ADAPTED FOR APPLICATION AS A PERSONAL AND PORTABLE RESPIRATOR, WHICH COULD FREE A PATIENT WITH RESPIRATORY FAILURE FROM BEING CONFINED AND TETHERED. THE PHASE I PROPOSAL IS FOR A FEASIBILITY STUDY FOR AN OPTIMAL DESIGN OF A WEARABLE AIR SUPPLY FOR A PNEUMATIC ARTIFICIAL HEART. THE STUDY WILL IDENTIFY STATE-OF-THE-ART AND DEVELOPMENTAL AIR PUMP DESIGNS, MOTORS, BEARINGS AND BATTERIES. A DESIGN CONFIGURATION WILL BE RECOMMENDED FOR DEVELOPMENT.",

THE MORTALITY RATE OF ANAEROBIC INFECTIONS CAN BE VERY HIGH IF THE INFECTIOUS AGENT IS NOT IDENTIFIED AND PROPER THERAPY INITIATED. PREVIOUS TO THE MID 1970'S, IDENTIFICATION OF THE INFECTING ANAEROBE WAS SUFFICIENT FOR PROPER TREATMENT, HOWEVER WITH THE INCREASED USAGE OF THE NEWER ANTIBIOTICS, THERE HAS BEEN A SUBSEQUENT INCREASE IN ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE OF SEVERAL GROUPS OF COMMONLY ENCOUNTERED PATHOGENIC ANAEROBES. THE ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCES OBSERVED ARE NOT LIMITED TO SPECIFIC GROUPS OF ORGANISMS NOR ARE THEY LIMITED TO PARTICULAR ANTIBIOTICS. THEREFORE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING OF ANAEROBIC BACTERIA ISOLATED FROM CLINICAL MATERIAL IS NOW NECESSARY AND SHOULD BE PERFORMED ROUTINELY. THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE ON LABORATORY STANDARDS (NCCLS) RECOMMENDED PROCEDURE FOR TESTING ANTIBIOTIC SUSCEPTIBILITIES OF ANAEROBIC BACTERIA IS EXTREMELY CUMBERSOME AND ALSO HAS GROWTH PROBLEMS WITH INDIVIDUAL STRAINTS OF OXYGEN SENSITIVE ORGANISMS. SIMILARLY, THE COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITIES GIVE INCONSISTENT RESULTS AND ARE INCAPABLE OF SUPPORTING THE GROWTH OF THE MORE OXYGEN SENSITIVE AND NUTRITIONALLY FASTIDIOUS ORGANISMS. THE RESULTS FROM THESE SYSTEMS TEND TO GIVE LOWER VALUES OR FALSE SUSCEPTIBILITIES FOR CERTAIN ANTIBIOTICS AND ORGANISMS. PLANNED FOR PHASE I WILL BE THE DESIGN OF A PROCESS BY WHICH PRODUCTION AND PACKAGING OF TEST ANTIBIOTIC SUSCEPTIBILITY PANELS WILL BE DONE UNDER STRICT ANAEROBIC CONDITIONS. ALSO, VARIOUS NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS WILL BE TESTED TO DETERMINE IF THEIR ADDITION TO THE NCCLS RECOMMENDED MEDIUM WILL IMPROVE GROWTH OF VARIOUS NUTRITIONALLY FASTIDIOUS ANAEROBES, ESPECIALLY ANAEROBIC COCCI.

WHILE NOT A DIAGNOSTIC PANACEA, THE SERUM ASSAY COULD QUICKEN DIAGNOSIS AND AID IN FOLLOW-UP ON THE PROGRESSION OR REGRESSION OF THE NEOPLASM. IN THIS PROPOSAL WE PLAN TO DEVELOP AN IMMUNOCHEMICAL ASSAY FOR HUMAN SERUM EPOXIDE HYDROLASE-PRENEOPLASTIC ANTIGEN IN ORDER TO FACILITATE STUDIES ON THIS ASSAY AS A SPECIFIC TEST FOR HEPATO-CELLULAR CARCINOMA IN HUMANS (PHASE I). THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF DEATH FROM CANCER, LIVER CANCER HAS AN ETIOLOGICALLY PREDISPOSING POPULATION OF MILLIONS WHO SUFFER FROM HEPATITIS B, CIRRHOSIS, AND OTHER CHRONIC LIVER DISEASES. BASED ON STUDIES IN FARBER'S GRIFFIN'S AND LEVIN'S LABORATORIES A PROTEIN EH-PNA (EPOXIDE HYDROLASE-PRENEOPLASTIC ANTIGEN) HAS BEEN DESCRIBED WHICH IS RELEASED FROM ITS MEMBRANOUS ENVIRONMENT SPECIALLY IN PRENEOPLASTIC AND NEOPLASTIC LIVER CELLS OF RODENTS. A SENSITIVE RADIOCHEMICAL ASSAY FOR EH-PNA DEVELOPED IN HAMMOCK'S LABORATORY (UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA) HAS NOW PROVIDED EVIDENCE THAT ELEVATED EH-PNA APPEARS IN THE SERUM OF PATIENTS WITH HEPATO-CELLULAR CARCINOMA. USING ANTIBODIES AGAINST RAT EPOXIDE HYDROLASE A RAPID ENZYME-LINKED-IMMUNOABSORBENT-ASSAY (ELISA) HAS BEEN DEVELOPED DEMONSTRATING THE APPLICABILITY OF THIS TECHNIQUE FOR MEASURING EH-PNA. THE PURPOSE OF PHASE I OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP AN IMMUNOCHEMICAL ASSAY FOR EH-PNA IN HUMAN SERUM. THIS ASSAY SHOULD BE OF PRIMARY INTEREST TO THE DIVISION OF CANCER BIOLOGY AND DIAGNOSIS, NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE. IT WILL INVOLVE WORK UNDER A LICENSING AGREEMENT ON AN INVENTION BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA (THE MEASUREMENT OF SERUM EH-PNA) FOR WHICH A PATENT APPLICATION HAS BEEN MADE. THIS WILL ALLOW A SMALL BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA TO PURSUE SPECIFIC RESEARCH THAT MAY LEAD EVENTUALLY TO THE RIGHTS FOR PRODUCTION AND MARKETING OF THE ASSAY KIT. COLLABORATION WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WILL OCCUR ON SCIENTIFIC ASPECTS OF THE ASSAY. THE SPECIFIC AIMS FOR PHASE I ARE: 1) TO ISOLATE EH-PNA FROM LIVER MICROZOMES OF A PRIMATE, 2) TO USE THE ISOLATED EH-PNA AS AN ANTIGEN TO INDUCE ANTISERA IN GOATS AND RABBITS, 3) TO MAKE THE ANTISERA (IGG FRACTION) MONO-SPECIFIC FOR EH-PNA, AND 4) TO DEVELOP AN ELISA FOR EH-PNA APPLICABLE TO HUMAN SERA. THE KIT WOULD THEN BE DISTRIBUTED FOR USE IN STUDIES ON THE EFFICIENCY OF THE ASSAY WHICH WILL PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR PHASE II OF THIS PROJECT.",

ONE CONCEPT UNDER CONSIDERATION CONSISTS IN ADMINSITRA TION OF A PROTECTIVE DRUG PRIOR TO A NERVE GAS CHALLENGE. THE PRETREATMENT DRUG HAS A PROPHYLACTIC ACTIVITY PROTECTING THE SUBJECT AGAINST THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF THE GAS. THE CARBAMATE DRUG PYRIDOSTIGMINE IS NOW BEING INVESTIGATED FOR THIS USE. PYRIDOSTIGMINE, A QUATERNARY, PROBABLY ACTS BY TEMPORARILY BLOCKING PERIPHERAL CHOLINESTERASE. IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO HAVE A HIGH ACTIVITY, LOW TOXICITY PROPHYLACTIC DRUG THAT WILL ACT IN THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM AS WELL AS PERIPHERALLY, AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO PYRIDOSTIGMINE. THE DRUGS IN THIS PROJECT ARE DESIGNED TO PENETRATE INTO THE CNS WHERE THEY CAN PROVIDE ADDED PROTECTION AGAINST NERVE GAS AGENTS. FOUR NEW CARBAMATE TARGET CANDIDATES WILL BE SYNTHESIZED AND TESTED FOR PROTECTIVE ACTION AGAINST A CHALLENGE TO ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE BY AN ORGANOPHOSPHOROUS SUBSTRATE. HIGH PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY WILL BE USED TO MONITOR THE PROTECTIVE ACTION OF THE DRUG ON THE ENZYME. AN INHIBITION OF THE HYDROLYSIS OF THE SUBSTRATE BY THE ENZYME WILL INDICATE POTENTIAL IN VIVO PROPHYLACTIC ACTIVITY FOR THE NEW DRUG.",

THE CALCULATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO GIVE EXTENSIVE INFORMATION ON PENETRATION AND SCATTERING AS A FUNCTION OF WAVELENGTH, INCLUDING THE RADIAL AND ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE EMERGENT FLUX. A LIMITED EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM WILL CHECK THE CALCULATIONS WHERE INPUT DATA IS AVAILABLE AND WILL SEEK TO PROVIDE BASIC ATTENUATION INFORMATION, ETC., WHERE SUCH DATA IS LACKING AS A STARTING POINT FOR COMPUTATION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY IS TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF APPLYING THE WELL-KNOWN \"FLYING-SPOT\" PRINCIPLE, WHICH REJECTS IMAGE-DEGRADING SCATTERED RADIATION, TO TRANSMITTED-IR IMAGING OF THIN BODY PARTS SUCH AS THE FEMALE BREAST. SUCH EXAMINATIONS NOW RELY ON WIDE (AND THUS SCATTER-RICH) BEAMS OF VISABLE LIGHT. THE ADVANTAGES OF SUCH A SCANNER IN SPITE OF ITS POOR SPATIAL RESOLUTION ARE EXPECTED TO INCLUDE (1) IMPROVED CONTRAST BECAUSE OF SCATTER REJECTION, (2) SENSITIVITY TO CERTAIN CHEMICAL AS WELL AS PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF TISSUES, (3) EFFECTIVELY REAL-TIME OUTPUT WITH NO IR FILM PROCESSING, (4) AVAILABILITY OF DIGITAL OUTPUT, FACILITATING, E.G., CONTRAST ENHANCEMENT, MULTI-WAVELENGTH TECHNIQUES, ETC., (5) DAYLIGHT OPERATION, (6) COMPLETE ABSENCE OF RISK, SO FAR AS IS KNOWN, EXCEPT FOR AN EASILY-MANAGED OPHTHALMOLOGICAL HAZARD, AND (7) MODEST COST, PORTABILITY AND ELIMINATION OF SPECIAL EXAMINATION ROOMS.

IF SUCCESSFUL, ABUNDANT CULTURED ALGAE PRODUCED DURING THE SUMMER PERIOD COULD BE HARVESTED AND STORED FOR USE DURING THE WINTER WHEN FOOD LEVELS ARE USUALLY THE RATE LIMITING FACTOR IN BIVALVE SEED PRODUCTION. OUR RESEARCH WILL COMPARE THE ALGAL CELL HARVESTING CAPABILITIES OF TWO COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE FILTRATION UNITS. THE RESULTANT ALGAL SLURRIES WILL BE FROZEN AND TESTED FOR NUTRITIONAL QUALITY AFTER ONE, THREE AND FIVE MONTHS STORAGE BY FEEDING THE ALGAE TO HARD CLAM (MERCENARIA MERCENARIA) SPAT AND MONITORING CLAM GROWTH RATE OVER A TWO WEEK PERIOD. THE FEASIBILITY OF RECYCLING A PORTION OF THE ALGAE AND THE USED ALGAL MEDIA WILL BE INVESTIGATED.

THE ASSAY IS BASED UPON GEL FILTRATION PROCEDURES TO DETERMINE THE PARTITIONING OF SPECIFIC CONTAMINANTS OF LOW MOLECULAR WEIGHT GSH POOLS, MEDIUM MOLECULAR WEIGHT MT POOLS, AND HIGH MOLECULAR WEIGHT ENZ POOLS. BECAUSE HIGH LEVELS OF CONTAMINANTS ARE TODAY FOUND IN URBAN RECREATIONAL LAKES FROM WHICH PEOPLE CATCH AND CONSUME 100'S OF TONS OF FISH ANNUALLY, IT IS CRITICAL THAT CONTAMINANT IMPACTS UPON HUMAN HEALTH ARE DETERMINED ACCURATELY. FISH LIVER TISSUES WILL BE ANALYSED FOR BIODETOXIFICATION USING ATOMIC ABSORPTION SPECTROPHOTOMETRY, GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY, GEL FILTRATION TECHNIQUES AND HISTOPATHOLOGY EXAMINATIONS. PHASE II WILL ESTABLISH AN INDEX OF TOXICITY, ASSIMILATION CAPACITIES FOR DETOXIFICATION SYSTEMS AND ESTABLISH A BLOOD CHEMISTRY PROGRAM FOR NON-ENVASIVE ANIMAL AND HUMAN DETOXIFICATION TESTS. WORK HAS A VERY HIGH POTENTIAL FOR MAKING COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE A HIGHLY ACCURATE TOXICITY TEST WHICH WILL ENABLE A CLEAR DETERMINATION OF WHAT SPECIFIC CONTAMINANTS ARE CAUSING TOXIC EFFECTS IN A MULTI-CONTAMINANT ENVIRONMENT.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         CYTOMEGALOVIRUS (CMV) APPEARS TO BE AN UBIQUITOUS VIRAL PATHOGEN. IT IS A HIGHLY OPPORTUNISTIC AGENT AND DUE TO ITS LATENCY, AS A MEMBER OF THE HERPES FAMILY OF VIRUSES, IT CAN RECUR ABRUPTLY, ERUPTING AS A LETHAL INFECTION. THE SPECTRUM THE MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY CAUSED BY CMV INCLUDES CONGENITAL, PERINATAL, POSTNATAL, ORGAN TRANSPLANT AND TRANSFUSION INFECTIONS. CURRENT DIAGNOSIS IS NOT WELL STANDARDIZED, AND IS BASED ON THE APPEARANCE OF CYTOPATHIC EFFECT IN A SUITABLE HOST TISSUE CULTURE. TIME FOR DIAGNOSIS IS LONG (7-21 DAYS) AND SPECIFICITY IS POOR. THIS RESEARCH PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO DEVELOP AN ENZYME EMMUNOASSAY TO RAPIDLY DETECT CMV ANTIGEN IN URINE. PHASE I FUNDING WILL ALLOW DEVELOPMENT OF MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES TO VARIOUS POLYPEPTIDES OF THE CMV VIRIOU. IN PHASE II, THE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES WILL BE FULLY CHARACTERIZED AND THEN USED 1) AS TOOLS TO PURIFY CMV POLYPEPTIDES FOR USE AS IMMUNOGENS IN THE PRODUCTION OF POLYCLONAL MONOSPECIFIC ANTISERA, AND 2) AS POTENTIAL DIAGNOSTIC REAGENTS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE POLYCLONAL REAGENTS TO DEVELOP A SENSITIVE (POLYCLONAL), SPECIFIC (MONOCLONAL), RAPID ASSAY TO DETECT CMV SHED IN THE URINE OF INFECTED INDIVIDUALS. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT SENSITIVITY WILL HAVE TO BE GREATLY INCREASED OVER THAT OF CONVENTIONAL COLORIMETRIC ELISA'S, AND THIS WILL BE APPROACHED IN SEVERAL NOVEL WAYS BY EXAMINING OTHER ENZYMES, FLUOROGENIC SUBSTRATES, AND ALTERNATE SOLID PHASES. POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF SUCH AN ASSAY ARE GREAT, AS THIS NEED IS NOT CURRENTLY BEING MET. SUCH AN ASSAY COULD BE EXPECTED TO BE WIDELY USED IN PEDIATRIC WARDS, PRENATAL CLINICS, ONCOLOGY CHEMOTHERAPY SETTINGS, TRANSPLANTATION CLINICS, AND TRANSFUSION CENTERS. THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THE GOALS AS OUTLINED BY THE RAPID VIRAL DIAGNOSTIC PROGRAM OF THE NIAID.",

CLEARANCE MECHANISMS VERY STRONGLY BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS, RESULTING IN A HIGHLY VARIABLE SENSITIVITY TO SUCH CONTAMINANTS. UP TO THIS TIME, DETAILED STUDIES OF CLEARANCE MECHANISMS AND PARTICULATE ACCUMULATION IN HUMAN SUBJECTS HAS NOT BEEN POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF THE EXCESSIVE RADIATION ASSOCIATED WITH EXISTING TECHNIQUES. THE RECENTLY DEVELOPED TECHNIQUE OF MAGNETOPNEUMOGRAPHY (MPG) NOW OFFERS A NON-INVASIVE, PURELY PASSIVE MEANS TO CONDUCT SUCH STUDIES. IT ALSO OFFERS THE POTENTIAL FOR ROUTINE SCREENING OF INDIVIDUALS TO MEASURE CLEARANCE TIMES AND HENCE CLASSIFY PEOPLE RELATIVE TO THEIR SUSCEPTIBILITY TO LUNG DAMAGE IN VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. ADDITIONALLY, MPG MAY BE USED TO MONITOR DUST ACCUMULATION FOR PEOPLE IN ENVIRONMENTS KNOWN TO BE HAZARDOUS OVER TIME; WHEN CRITICAL LEVELS OF PARTICULATE ACCUMULATIONS HAVE BEEN REACHED, THOSE INDIVIDUALS MAY BE REMOVED AS REQUIRED FROM THE ENVIRONMENT IN QUESTION. AN EXAMPLE OF THIS WOULD BE THE MONITORING OF COAL DUST ACCUMULATION IN COAL MINERS. THE FIRST GENERATION OF SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNETOMETERS CONSTRUCTED BY S.H.E. CORPORATION AND USED IN THE PIONEERING MPG WORK HAVE CERTAIN SERIOUS LIMITATIONS WHICH MAKE WIDESPREAD CLINICAL RESEARCH IMPRACTICAL. WE ARE HERE PROPOSING TO IDENTIFY THE SOURCES OF THOSE LIMITATIONS AND MINIMIZE OR ELIMINATE THEM. THIS WILL BE DONE IN CONSULTATION WITH THE MEDICAL RESEARCH GROUP WHICH CONDUCTED MOST OF THE PIONEERING RESEARCH. THE PRIMARY PHASE I EFFORT WILL STUDY THE INSTRUMENT DRIFT SOURCES (FLUX MOTION IN SUPERCONDUCTING MATERIALS, MAGNETIC RELAXATION EFFECTS, ETC.) RESULTING FROM EXPOSURE TO THE DC FIELDS REQUIRED BY THE TECHNIQUE. VARIOUS NEW PICKUP COIL ARRAYS WILL BE EVALUATED TO OBTAIN IMPROVED SENSITIVITY DEEP IN THE LUNGS AND TO REDUCE MEASUREMENT TIME. UPON RESOLUTION OF THESE TWO ISSUES, A PRELIMINARY DESIGN OF A COMPLETE INSTRUMENT SUITABLE FOR EXTENSIVE CLINICAL STUDIES WILL BE PREPARED. IN PHASE II, THAT PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENT WILL BE PRODUCED AND MADE AVAILABLE FOR CLINICAL STUDIES. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THESE STUDIES WILL LEAD TO OUR COMMERCIALIZATION AND PRODUCTION OF AN MPG INSTRUMENT PACKAGE.",

PRODUCING CHRONIC ILLNESS, IT SPREADS WITH INCREASING DEMANDS FOR WATER AND INTENSIFIED IRRIGATION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. IT IS A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO THE HIGH LEVEL OF MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY IN ENDEMIC AREAS. MOLLUSCICIDING, SANITARY ENGINEERING AND CHEMOTHERAPY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO KEEP THE DISEASE IN CHECK. ADDITIONAL CONTROL MEASURES ARE NEEDED. ONE SUCH APPROACH INVOLVES BIOLOGICAL INTERFERENCE WITH DISEASE TRANSMISSION IN THE FIELD. TO SOME EXTENT INTERFERENCE WITH TRANSMISSION OCCURS NATURALLY: BY PREDATION OF CERCARIAE, MIRACIDIA AND SNAILS BY CERTAIN, FISH, PRAWNS, ANNELIDS, TURBELLARIA AND CARNIVOROUS PLANTS. A NEW APPROACH TO REDUCING TRANSMISSION DEPENDS ON IMMIBILIZATION OF CERCARIAE, THE LARVAL WHICH INFECTS MAN BY PENETRATING INTACT SKIN. IN THE LABORATORY A WATERSOLUBLE FACTOR EMITTED BY A SYMBIOTIC ROTIFER SPECIES COLONIZING VECTOR SNAILS DOES THIS BY PARALYZING THE CERCARIAE AND THUS REDUCING THEIR CAPACITY TO EMERGE FROM SNAILS AND TO INFECT MAN. PHASE I OBJECTIVES ARE TO: FRACTIONATE THIS ANTICERCARIAL ROTIFER FACTOR IN WATER FROM CLONED CULTURES OF ROTIFER; ISOLATE AND PURIFY THE ACTIVE FRACTION(S); AND CHARACTERIZE AND DEFINE IT CHEMICALLY AND STRUCTURALLY.",

POTASSIUM LEVELS CAN BE VERY LABILE REQUIRING FREQUENT MEASUREMENTS WITH SUBSTANTIAL LABOR AND LAB CHARGES.

SYNTHESIZE A DYE MOLECULE THAT IS SENSITIVE TO THE CONCENTRATION OF POTASSIUM-ION IN THE PATHO-PHYSIOLOGICAL RANGE. 2. DEVELOP A MEANS OF IMMOBILIZING THE K+ SENSOR DYE MOLECULE WITHIN A SEMIPERMEABLE MEMBRANE. 3. CONSTRUCT A WORKING MODEL OF THE FIBEROPTIC PROBE. 4. DETERMINE EFFECTIVENESS OF PROBE BY IN-VITRO ANALYSIS OF BODY FLUID WITH KNOWN K+ CONCENTRATIONS. THE LONGER TERM PHASE II OBJECTIVES ARE TO MINIATURIZE THE K+ PROBE AND COMBINE IT INTO A MULTIPARAMETER PROBE FOR MONITORING OF SEVERAL COMPONENTS SUCH AS 02, C02, AND PH.",

FOR EXAMPLE, MOST STATISTICAL PROCEDURES IN CLINICAL TRIAL EVALUATIONS FOCUS ON A PARTICULAR TREATMENT REGIMEN THAT IS EFFECTIVE AGAINST A SPECIFIC TYPE OF CANCER. ON THE OTHER HAND, RELIABILITY GROWTH MODEL METHODS CAN BE USED TO ANALYZE A SEQUENCE OF CLINICAL TRIALS THAT HAS OCCURRED OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS TO ASSESS THE GROWTH IN THE SUCCESS IN TREATING A GIVEN CANCER AND PREDICT FUTURE SUCCESS PROBABILITIES. THE SPECIFIC PURPOSES OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH ARE TO CONVERT THE DATA OBTAINED FROM PREVIOUS CLINICAL TRIALS ON SPECIFIED TYPES OF CANCER OR THE DATA ON BOTH SPECIFICITY AND SENSITIVITY IN CANCER SCREENING TESTS TO \"SUCCESSES\" AND \"FAILURES\" AS REQUIRED FOR ANALYSIS BY RELIABILITY GROWTH METHODOLOGY, TO ESTIMATE THE REQUISITE MODEL PARAMETERS AND TEST THE GOODNESS OF FIT OF THE MODEL TO THE DATA FOR THE PARAMETRIC CLASS OF MODELS, TO ASSESS THE APPLICABILITY OF THE NONPARAMETRIC AND BAYES PROCEDURES WHERE THE PARAMETRIC TECHNIQUES ARE NOT SUITABLE, AND TO EXTEND EXISTING MODELS TO ACCOUNT FOR SUCH FACTORS AS CLINICAL TRIALS LASTING FOR DIFFERENT LENGTHS OF TIME. THE PRINCIPAL RESEARCH AREAS ARE: FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF PARAMETRIC RELIABILITY GROWTH MODELS, EXTENSIONS AND MODIFICATIONS OF THE NONPARAMETRIC MODELS WITH AN EMPHASIS ON BAYES AND EMPIRICAL BAYES TECHNIQUES AND APPLICATION AND EVALUATION OF EXISTING AND MODIFIED RELIABILITY GROWTH MODELS TO ASSESS CLINICAL TRIAL METHODOLOGY AND CANCER SCREENING PROCEDURES. METHODS DEVELOPED IN THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL PROVIDE INVALUABLE TOOLS FOR ASSESSING AND IN SOME INSTANCES PREDICTING PATTERNS OF RESPONSE IN SEVERAL AREAS OF CANCER RESEARCH, I.E., ASSESSING CHANGES IN RESPONSE RATES IN CANCER CLINICAL TRIALS AND ASSESSING CHANGES IN SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY IN CANCER SCREENING PROCEDURES.

CONSIDERING THESE CONFLICTING CONDITIONS OF ATTRACTIVENESS AND DIFFICULTY IN USING COAL AS A FUEL, IT BECOMES QUITE IMPORTANT HOW THE COAL IS HANDLED AND CONVERTED TO HEAT FOR LOCOMOTIVE POWER. A STUDY OF HEAT ENGINES FOR USING COAL, LEADS US TO CONCLUDE THAT A GASIFIED COAL PRODUCER IS THE BEST METHOD FOR USING COAL. WE HAVE EXAMINED THE MAJOR SUBSYSTEMS INVOLVED: THE GAS PRODUCER, GAS CLEANER, CONTROLS, WASTE DISPOSAL, ENGINE AND THE ELECTRIC DRIVE. THE ONE AREA NEEDING FURTHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IS THE GAS-CLEANING SUBSYSTEM. WE ARE PROPOSING TO DEVELOP THE CHEMISTRY AND HANDLING SYSTEM NECESSARY TO FIT A GAS-CLEANING SYSTEM ON A GASIFIED COAL LOCOMOTIVE. A SERIOUS EFFORT IS REQUIRED TO INSURE THAT SULPHUR IN THE COAL DOES NOT END UP IN THE ENGINE EXHAUST. ONCE A GAS-CLEANING SYSTEM CAN BE DEMONSTRATED THAT CONTROLS THIS POLLUTANT, THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT LOCOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS, RAILROADS AND HEAVY EQUIPMENT FABRICATORS WILL BECOME INVESTORS AND PURCHASERS.",

WHEN BUILDINGS ARE DEMOLISHED TO ALLOW NEW CONSTRUCTION, MOST WRECKAGE WASTE BECOMES A DISPOSAL PROBLEM FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT. THIS DEMOLITION WASTE IS A POTENTIAL BUILDING MATERIALS RESOURCE IF PROPER REPROCESSING METHODS CAN BE INVENTED. THIS PROJECT WILL STUDY THE PAST HISTORY OF BUILDING MATERIALS REPROCESSING, WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IN PARALLEL INDUSTRIES (WOOD, METAL, CONCRETE, ETC.), AND THE STATUS OF REPROCESSING TODAY. IT WILL CHARACTERIZE MAJOR SOURCES OF MATERIALS FOR REPROCESSING BY: A) THEIR ABILITY TO BE SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER, AND B) THEIR QUANTITY IN THE U.S. BUILDING STOCK (E.G., HOW MUCH IS BRICK WITH WOOD SPANNING MEMBERS, ETC.). OTHER ISSUES INVESTIGATED WILL BE: THE NEED FOR TESTING AND QUALITY CONTROL TO ASSURE GOOD ENGINEERING PROPERTIES AND THE RELATIVE BENEFITS IN EMBODIED ENERGY BY REPROCESSING. A CANDIDATE LIST OF REPROCESSING METHODS WILL BE DEVELOPED. THE METHODS WILL BE PRIORITIZED BY SCREENING AGAINST THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED FACTORS. IF A LIMITED NUMBER OF HIGH PRIORITY BUILDING MATERIALS REPROCESSING METHODS EMERGES, PHASE II WILL EXAMINE THE TECHNICAL VIABILITY OF DEVELOPING PRACTICAL, USEFUL AND COST-EFFECTIVE METHODS FOR COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS.

FOR SHORT DURATION MISSIONS, AN ASTRONAUT'S METABOLIC NEEDS ARE MET FROM ON-BOARD STORES AND THEIR WASTES DISPOSED. HOWEVER, THE WASTE FRACTION REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF BULK, AS WELL AS MASS AND STORED ENERGY, AND, THEREFORE, FOR LONG TERM MISSIONS, REQUIRED RECYCLING. PROGRESS IN BIOTECHNOLOGY HAS REACHED A POINT WHERE IT IS POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN ENZYMES CAPABLE OF HYDROLYZING THE CARBOHYDRATES IN BIOMASS TO THEIR COMPONENT BASIC SUGARS. IN GENERAL, BIOLOGICAL METHODS, ENZYMATIC CONVERSION MAKES POSSIBLE THE PRODUCTION OF SUGARS, BASIC CHEMICALS, AND FOODS FROM THE LARGE AMOUNTS OF LIGNOCELLULOSIC MATERIALS NOW TREATED AS WASTE. OF SPECIAL INTEREST IS THE CONVERSION OF CELLULOSE TO ITS MONOSACCHARIDE GLUCOSE, BLOOD SUGAR. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON A SIMPLE SMALL SCALE ENZYMATOR/HYDROLYZOR (EH) UNIT CAPABLE OF REDUCING THE ASTRONAUT'S NON-DIGESTIBLE VEGETATIVE WASTE FRACTION. THE EH UNIT CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO NASA'S CONTROLLED ECOLOGICAL LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM (CELSS) AND WILL BE PART OF OUR WASTE MANAGEMENT MODULE (WMM) OF THE SPACE FARM, A SYSTEM SYMBIOTIC AND COMPLEMENTARY TO AN ASTRONAUT'S NEEDS. POSSIBLE PRODUCTS OF A WMM ARE GLUCOSE OR OTHER SUGARS, ALCOHOLS, ALDEHYDES, ORGANIC ACIDS, METHANE, VITAMINS, SALTS, SLUDGE, AND WATER. THE EH SYSTEM WILL BE DESIGNED TO FACILITATE RESEARCH FOR THE DETERMINATION OF PERTINENT CONVERSION PARAMETERS, TO TEST COMPUTER SIMULATION (MODELING), AND TO SERVE AS A TEST BED FOR INSTRUMENTATION.",

THIS IS A DIFFICULT DESIGN PROBLEM BECAUSE OF THE HIGH SENSITIVITY TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MATERIALS HANDLING SYSTEM AND BECAUSE OF THE HIGH NUMBER OF SYSTEM INTERACTIONS WHICH INFLUENCE THE DESIGN, OPERATION, AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FURNACE. AN APPROACH IS PROPOSED WHICH WILL DETERMINE THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE SYSTEM INTERACTIONS WITH THE MATERIAL HANDLING SYSTEM AND IDENTIFY THE PRINCIPAL PROBLEMS IN THE SCALE-UP OF THE RPAF. VENDER AND LITERATURE CONTRIBUTIONS WILL BE SURVEYED. THE TECHNICAL MERIT AND FEASIBILITY OF THE MATERIALS HANDLING APPROACH WILL BE ESTABLISHED BY THE ANALYSIS. THE UNIQUE COLLECTION OF ATTRACTIVE FEATURES FOUND ONLY IN THE RPAF MAKE AN IMPROVED PROTOTYPE SIGNIFICANT NOT ONLY TO CHROMITE REDUCTION BUT ALSO TO AN IMPROVED CONTINUOUS STEEL PROCESS AND TO PROCESSING IMPROVEMENTS IN ABRASIVES AND REFRACTORIES.

        "abstract": "Abstract         A. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A METHODOLOGY BY WHICH THE GENES CODING FOR DISEASE-SPECIFIC ANTIGENS CAN BE RAPIDLY CLONED USING RECOMBINANT DNA TECHNIQUES. THE SYSTEM LENDS ITSELF TO HIGH LEVEL EXPRESSION OF THESE ANTIGENS AS HYBRID PROTEINS, WHICH FACILITATES PRODUCTION OF ANTIBODIES TO THE ANTIGENS. WITH BOTH ANTIGEN AND ANTIBODY, IMMUNODIAGNOSTIC TESTS CAN BE PRODUCED FOR DETECTION OF THESE ANTIGENS IN CLINICAL SAMPLES. THIS SYSTEM, ENCOMPASSING RECOMBINANT DNA AND IMMUNODIAGNOSTIC TECHNIQUES, CAN POTENTIALLY DISCOVER LARGE NUMBERS OF DISEASE SPECIFIC ANTIGENS. A SPECTRUM OF ANTIGENS, SPECIFIC FOR ONE DISEASE, AND TESTS FOR THEM, COULD HAVE CONSIDERABLE DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC VALUE. B. IN PHASE I A CDNA LIBRARY WILL BE CONSTRUCTED FROM AN ESTABLISHED HUMAN LEUKEMIA CELL LINE SUCH AS ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA (ALL). CLONES CARRYING LEUKEMIA SPECIFIC SEQUENCES WILL BE IDENTIFIED BY DIFFERENTIAL SCREENING WITH PROBES FROM NORMAL LEUKOCYTE CDNA AND PROBES FROM ALL CELL LINE-DERIVED CDNA. CLONING WILL BE INTO THE LAMBDAGTLL EXPRESSION VECTOR. CLONES CARRYING LEUKEMIA SPECIFIC DNA CAN BE INDUCED, WHICH, WITH THE LAMBDAGTLL SYSTEM, WILL LEAD TO EXPRESSION OF SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF THE ANTIGEN FUSED TO B-GALACTOSIDASE (HYBRID PROTEINS). BECAUSE OF THEIR LARGE SIZE, THE PROTEINS CAN BE EASILY PURIFIED AND USED TO RAISE SPECIFIC ANTISERA. C. PHASE II WILL BE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE CLONED, EXPRESSED ANTIGENS AND THEIR COGNATE ANTIBODIES. WITH THE SPECIFIC ANTISERA, HISTOLOGICAL AND IMMUNOLOGICAL TESTS WILL BE CARRIED OUT TO IDENTIFY THOSE ANTIGENS SPECIFIC FOR THE ALL CELL LINE. IN ADDITION, OTHER CELL LINES, INCLUDING DIFFERENT ESTABLISHED LEUKEMIA CELL LINES, WILL BE TESTED FOR THE PRESENCE OF THESE ANTIGENS. IN PARALLEL, DIAGNOSTIC TESTS WOULD BE DEVELOPED FOR THESE ANTIGENS, WITH THE GOAL OF USING THEM FOR CLINICAL DIAGNOSTIC RESEARCH. D. THE USE OF RECOMBINANT DNA TECHNIQUES GIVES THIS METHODOLOGY THE POWER TO FIND SUBSTANTIAL NUMBERS OF, AS YET, UNIDENTIFIED LEUKEMIA ASSOCIATED ANTIGENS. THIS COULD LEAD TO DISCOVERY OF ANTIGENS USEFUL IN EARLY DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF A SPECIFIC LEUKEMIA, AND HAS THE POTENTIAL OF DISCOVERING AN ANTIGEN(S) SPECIFIC FOR MORE THAN ONE LEUKEMIA. THIS GENERAL METHODOLOGY COULD BE APPLIED TO THE STUDY OF ANY SPECIFIC DISEASE. REFER TO: NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE, DIVISION OF CANCER BIOLOGY AND DIAGNOSIS",

THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS PROJECT WOULD BE TO OVERCOME THE GREATEST SHORTCOMING OF THE BUTANOL FERMENTATION, THE VERY LOW PRODUCT STREAM CONCENTRATIONS. THE OVERALL SIGNIFICANT FEATURE OF THIS PROJECT WOULD BE THE APPLICATION OF A NOVEL EXTRACTIVE FERMENTATION TO OVERCOME THIS BARRIER. THE FORMED BUTANOL MAY BE REMOVED FROM THE FERMENTOR, THEREBY RELIEVING INHIBITORY AND TOXIC EFFECTS WHICH LIMIT BUTANOL PRODUCTION. THIS PROCESS WOULD UTILIZE AN EFFICIENT EXTRACTANT FOR BUTANOL AND BUTYRIC ACID, N-BUTYL-N-BUTYRATE ESTER, WHICH IS GENERATED DIRECTLY FROM THE MOST TOXIC PRODUCTS OF THE FERMENTATION AND WHICH ITSELF WOULD BE A DESIRABLE END-PRODUCT AS INDUSTRIAL SOLVENT AND FUEL.

AT VISIBLE WAVELENGTHS, OIL APPEARS \"BLACK\" EVEN AFTER SHORT INTERVALS AND WITH LOW PERCENTAGE CARBON LEVELS. THE REASONS FOR THIS ARE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE RATIO OF OPTICAL WAVELENGTHS TO THE SIZE OF THE SUSPENDED CARBON IN THE OIL (EVEN WHEN PEPTIZED BY THE DISPERSANT). THEREFORE, VISIBLE LIGHT ABSORPTION CANNOT ACCURATELY MONITOR OIL QUALITY. IT IS NECESSARY TO CONSIDER WAVELENGTHS IN THE FAR INFRA-RED REGION OF THE SPECTRUM. A SYSTEM, AND METHOD OF RESEARCH, TO USE FAR INFRA-RED RADIATION TO MONITOR SUSPENDED CARBON AND DISPERSANT FAILURE IS PROPOSED.

THEREFORE, DUE TO THE NATURALLY LOW EMISSIVITY OF THE METHANE FLAME, CONVERSION TO NATURAL GAS (OF FURNACES ORIGINALLY DESIGNED FOR FUEL-OILS OR PULVERIZED COAL) RESULTS IN A WASTE OF FUEL ENTHALPY AND CORRESPONDING LOSS OF THERMAL EFFICIENCY. THIS PROPOSAL IS FOR FUNDS TO INVESTIGATE A NOVEL PLASMA-BURNER CONCEPT. THE CONCEPT IS THAT OF COMBINING A LOW POWER PLASMA JET WITH A NATURAL GAS FUEL FEEDSTOCK. THIS IS DONE IN SUCH A WAY THAT LESS THAN 1% OF THE METHANE THROUGHPUT IS PASSED IN CONTACT WITH THE PLASMA ARC. THE FRACTION THAT ENCOUNTERS THE PLASMA IS COMPLETELY DISSOCIATED TO CARBON AND HYDROGEN. THE NET RESULT IS TO PRODUCE A FLAME SEEDED WITH SMALL CARBON PARTICLE \"RADIATORS\" TO INCREASE FLAME EMISSIVITY ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE FLAME.

A KEY PROBLEM IN EVOLVING AN ELECTRODE IMPLANT TECHNOLOGY BASE IS THE ABILITY TO MAINTAIN POINT SOURCES OF BARE METAL AT THE TIP OF AN INSULATED WIRE WHICH REPRODUCIBLY DELIVERS KNOWN AMOUNTS OF ELECTRICAL STIMULATION OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME. THE PERCUTANEOUS SALINE ENVIRONMENT AND FLEXING OF THE IMPLANT SERIOUSLY DEGRADE THE ADHESION OF THE INSULATING COATING TO THE WIRE THEREBY INCREASING ELECTRODE AREA WITH CONCOMITANT FAILURE OF THE DEVICE. DURING PHASE I OF THIS PROGRAM, WE PROPOSE TO ELECTROCHEMICALLY GENERATE THIN, COHERENT POLYPHENYLENE OXIDE COATINGS ONTO PLATINUM WIRE SUBSTRATES FROM PHENOLIC MONOMERS. PREVIOUS WORK HAS SHOWN THESE COATINGS TO MANIFEST EXCELLENT ADHESION TO METALLIC SUBSTRATES DUE TO CHEMICAL BOND FORMATION BETWEEN THE SUBSTRATE AND POLYMER AS IT IS FORMED IN SITU. THE INTEGRITY OF THESE COATINGS WILL BE ASSESSED BY SEM AND ESCA. ELECTROCHEMICAL TECHNIQUES DESIGNED TO ASSESS THE COATINGS' RESISTANCE TO SALINE WILL ALSO BE APPLIED. PHASE II WORK WILL FOCUS ON IN-DEPTH CHEMICAL, ELECTROCHEMICAL, AND MECHANICAL EVALUATION OF THE OPTIMIZED COATINGS. BIOCOMPATIBILITY EXPERIMENTS WILL ALSO BE CARRIED OUT SO THAT BY THE END OF PHASE II HARDWARE MAY BE SUPPLIED TO NINCDS FOR IN VIVO STUDIES.",

BASED ON ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE AND PRELIMINARY TISSUE CULTURE STUDIES, CERTAIN PLATINUM COMPLEXES SHOW CONSIDERABLE PROMISE AS EFFECTIVE THERAPEUTIC AGENTS FOR HERPETIC INFECTIONS. THE RESEARCH PROPOSED IN PHASE I WILL BE CONCERNED WITH TESTING TEN PLATINUM COMPLEXES IN A COMBINATION OF IN VITRO AND IN VIVO STUDIES. ONE OF THESE, CISPLATIN, WILL BE INVESTIGATED EXTENSIVELY IN ORDER TO BRING IT TO THE STAGE OF CLINICAL TESTING BY THE END OF PHASE I. SIX OTHER PLATINUM COMPLEXES, ALL KNOWN ANTITUMOR COMPOUNDS, WILL BE INVESTIGATED IN VITRO AGAINST VARIOUS STRAINS OF HSV-1 AND HSV-2. THE REMAINING THREE COMPLEXES, NEWLY SYNTHESIZED IN THIS LABORATORY AND CONTAINING THE CIS- MOIETY BOUND TO THREE KNOWN ANTIVIRAL DRUGS (ACYCLOVIR, ARA-ADA, AND CYCLARADINE), WILL BE CHARACTERIZED AND IN VITRO TESTING WILL BE INITIATED. PHASE II WILL INVOLVE A) EXTENSIVE CLINICAL EVALUATION OF CISPLATIN WITH THE AIM OF COMMERCIAL APPLICATION, B) COMPLETION OF THE IN VITRO AND IN VIVO STUDIES OF THE REMAINING NINE COMPLEXES, AND C) THE ONSET OF CLINICAL TRIALS FOR THE MOST PROMISING ANTIVIRALS IN THIS GROUP.",

TORQUE MEASUREMENTS ARE UNRELIABLLE DUE TO VARIABLE FRICTION COEFFICIENTS AND OTHER MORE ACCURATE METHODS SUCH AS HYDRAULIC TENSIONERS, ULTRASONIC MEASUREMENTS, STRAIN GAUGES, AND X-RAY DIFFRACTION ARE OFTEN IMPRATICAL IN THE FIELD. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT BOLT AXIAL STRESSES, AND THEREFORE LOADS, CAN BE DETERMINED RELIABLY IN THE FIELD USING THE MAGNETOELASTIC PROPERTIES OF FERROMAGNETIC MATERIAL. WHEN A FERROMAGNETIC MATERIAL, SUCH AS A STEEL BOLT, IS SUBJECTED TO A MAGNETIZING FIELD A SERIES OF ABRUPT CHANGES IN MATERIAL MAGNETIZATIONOCCURS. THIS PHENOMENON IS KNOWN AS \"BARKHAUSEN NOISE.\" PREVIOUS TESTS HAVE CONFIRMED THAT THE BARKHAUSEN NOISE LEVEL IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE STRESS LEVEL IN THE MATERIAL WHICH IS BEING SUBJECTED TO THE MAGNETIXZING FIELD. SMALL, PORTABLE EQUIPMENT IS COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE WHICH USES THE BARKHAUSEN PRINCPLE TO DETERMINE THE RESIDUAL STRESSES IN WELD SEAMS, FORGINGS, CASTINGS, SHAFTS AND CAMS, ETC. THIS PROPOSAL IS TO MODIFY THIS COMMERCIALLY AVAILABL EQUIPMENT TO MEET THE NEED TO BOLT STRESS MEASUREMENT AND THEN TO DEMONSTRATE THAT BOLT AXIAL STRESSES AND HENCE BOLT AXIAL LOADS, CAN BE CORRELATED TO THE BARKHAUSEN NOISE LEVEL MEASURED ON THE BOLT HEAD OR IN A SMALL DIAMETER HOLE IN THE BOLT SHANK.",

HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA HAS BEEN IMPLICATED AS A PRIMARY RISK FACTOR IN CORONARY HEART DISEASE YET MAJOR QUESTIONS REGARDING CHOLESTEROL ABSORPTION, TRANSPORT, REVERSE TRANSPORT AND DISPOSITION REMAIN TO BE ELUCIDATED FOR LACK OF A SAFE, CONVENIENT NON-RADIOACTIVE TRACER METHODOLOGY. THUS, STABLE ISOTOPE LABELED DIETARY STEROLS IN CLINICAL PROTOCOLS, COMBINED WITH MASS FRAGMENTOGRAPHY, CAN BE EXPECTED TO AID THE ELABORATION OF INDECES FOR SUCH PARAMETERS AS STEROL POOL SIZE, TRANSIT TIME, VOLUME DISTRIBUTION AND CLEARANCE. THE SYNTHETIC APPROACH REQUIRES DISCONNECTION AT C-22 OF THE STEROL SIDE CHAIN AND RESYNTHESIS WITH THE LABELS POSITIONED IN THE ISOPROPYL TERMINUS AT (C-25, 26 AND 27), THE LATTER BEING DERIVED FROM (13)C3-ACETONE. INCLUDED AMONG THE PROJECT TASKS ARE DEVELOPMENT OF PATHWAYS CONSERVATIVE TOWARDS ISOTOPE AND OPTIMIZATION OF YIELDS TO PROVIDE MULTIGRAM QUANTITIES OF BOTH STEROLS IN SEVEN SYNTHETIC STEPS. YIELDS IN THE 10-20% RANGE ARE EXPECTED. ADDITIONALLY, THE PROGRAM CALLS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF AN A-RING DEGRADATION AND RESYNTHESIS VIA THE ROBINSON ANNELATION TO GIVE (13)C4-LABELED STEROLS. A REPERTORY OF VARIOUS INCREMENTALLY LABELED A AND/OR CHAIN LABELED STEROLS CAN THEN BE ENVISIONED FOR APPLICATION IN SIMULTANEOUS STUDIES BY MULTIPLE ROUTES OF TRACER ADMINISTRATION.",

THE \"VECTORS\" THAT CAN BE PROCESSED SIMULTANEOUSLY ARE TOO SHORT TO ACHIEVE MUCH IMPROVEMENT OVER SERIAL PROCESSING. ATTEMPTS TO INCREASE THE SIZE OF THESE VECTORS SIMPLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF OPERATIONS RATHER THAN DECREASE SOLUTION TIMES. WE SUGGEST AN ENTIRELY NEW APPROACH BASED ON THE FACTORS OF THE INVERSE. THESE FACTORS CAN BE PERFORMED IN PARALLEL, WITH ONLY TWO TO PERHAPS EIGHT SERIAL STEPS FOR LARGE SYSTEMS. IN PHASE I, WE PROPOSE TO FIND PARTITIONING SCHEMES THAT WILL ENHANCE PARALLELISM WHILE MAINTAINING SPARSITY OF THE FACTORS OF THE INVERSE, FOR VARIOUS TYPES OF SPARSE MATRIX TOPOLOGIES. THE FEASIBILITY OF THE NEW METHOD WILL BE DEMONSTRATED BY PROVIDING A SERIAL COMPUTER IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATING ITS PERFORMANCE ON REAL-WORLD TEST CASES. THE PROGRAM WOULD INCLUDE A BOOKKEEPING CODE TO CALCULATE POTENTIAL SPEEDUPS AVAILABLE FROM VARIOUS TYPES OF EXISTING PARALLEL ARCHITECTURES. THE DOMINANT OBJECTIVE OF THE RESEARCH IS TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF PARALLEL PROCESSOR CAPABILITIES TO ACHIEVE FASTER AND CHEAPER SPARSE MATRIX COMPUTATIONAL TECHNIQUES.",

OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO DEVISE A SYSTEM WITH A NEW TYPE OF DATA PROCESSING ALORITHM THAT ALLOWS A DRASTIC REDUCTION IN MEMORY NEEDED FOR DATA STORAGE. IT WILL BE ACHIEVED BY USING AN INNOVATIVE TIME-VARIANT DATA COMPRESSION TECHNIQUE. THE MAIN DIFFERENCE IN DATA STORAGE BETWEEN TRADITIONAL METHODS AND OUR PROPOSAL IS THAT OURS WILL STORE THE LENGTH OF TIME AN INPUT SIGNAL IS IN THE SAME APERTURE AND THE DIRECTION OF THE SLOPE BUT NOT THE VALUE OF THE SIGNAL ITSELF. THE DATA STORAGE RATE AUTOMATICALLY ADAPTS TO THE SLOPE OF AN INPUT SIGNAL, THEREBY MAINTAINING THE ACCURACY OF THE STORED SIGNAL. THIS WILL SAVE CONSIDERABLE MEMORY SPACE BY ELIMINATING NONESSENTIAL DATA. ENCLOSED IS GENERAL INFORMATION AND A BLOCK DIAGRAM OF THE TIME-VARIANT DATA COMPRESSION SYSTEM WE WOULD PREPARE FOR USE IN THE MEDICAL ARENA.

        "abstract": "Abstract         IMPROVED PROCESSES ARE SOUGHT FOR DEASHING AND DESULFURIZING COAL. THIS INVESTIGATION WILL FOCUS ON ULTRASONIC EFFECTS ON FINE PARTICLE SEPARATION OF COAL FROM ASH, PYRITE AND LIKE MINERAL MATTER AFTER GRINDING. COAL ORGANIC MATTER, INCLUDING SULFUR CONTAINING ORGANICS, HAS A SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF LESS THAN ABOUT 1.6. CLAYS AND MINERALS FROM OVERBURDEN HAVE SPECIFIC GRAVITIES BETWEEN 2.4 - 2.8, WHILE THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF PYRITE IS ABOUT 5.0. HENCE, CONVENTIONAL COAL CLEANING PLANTS USE SPECIFIC GRAVITY TO EFFECT REMOVAL OF CLAYS AND PYRITE. MANY COALS CONTAIN PYRITE AND MINERALS WHICH ARE OF SMALL PARTICLE SIZE AND WIDELY DISPERSED. SPECIFIC GRAVITY WILL NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN REMOVING WIDELY DISPERSED PYRITE. THE CYCLIC VIBRATORY MOTION OF A PNEUMATIC MEDIUM INFLUENCES SUSPENDED DISCRETE PARTICLES TO A VARYING EXTENT. AT ONE EXTREME, WHEN THE PARTICLES ARE VERY SMALL AND/OR THE FREQUENCY IS LOW, THE PARTICLES VIBRATE IN PHASE WITH THE MEDIUM AND AT THE SAME AMPLITUDE. AT THE OTHER EXTREME, WHEN THE PARTICLES ARE VERY LARGE AND/OR THE FREQUENCY IS HIGH THE PARTICLES REMAIN STATIONARY. AS THE FREQUENCY IS INCREASED, THE LARGEST PARTICLES ARE THE FIRST TO LAG BEHIND THE VIBRATION OF THE MEDIUM AND, FINALLY, TO STOP VIBRATING. INCREASE OF FREQUENCY FURTHER LIMITS THE SIZE OF PARTICLES RESPONDING, THE SQUARE OF THE LIMITING PARTICLE DIAMETER BEING INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO THE FREQUENCY. IN THIS PROJECT, ULTRASONIC EFFECTS ON ENTRAINMENT AND SEDIMENTATION AS A FUNCTION OF PARTICLE SIZE, DENSITY AND SHAPE WILL BE ANALYZED. AFTER FINE GRINDING COAL PARTICLES REMAIN MORE EQUIAXED THAN ASH CONTENTS WHICH ASSUME A PLATE-LIKE SHAPE. WHEN INTRODUCED INTO A GAS STREAM IN A TUBULAR REACTOR AND EXPOSED TO ULTRASONIC STANDING WAVES THESE DISSIMILAR PARTICLES WILL SEPARATE BECAUSE OF DIFFERING SIZE, DENSITY AND SHAPE THUS ENABLING EASY COLLECTION. THE TWO PRODUCTS WILL THEN BE ANALYZED BY EXISTING METHODS SUCH AS WASHABILITY AND SUBSEQUENT PROXIMATE ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE SEPARATION EFFICIENCY OF THE TECHNIQUE. THE PHASE I FEASIBILITY DEMONSTRATION SHOULD PROVIDE THE NECESSARY ENGINEERING DATA FOR FURTHER PHASE II AND III DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTION ARRAYS.",

THE TECHNIQUE UTILIZES THE PROPAGATION OF HIGH FREQUENCY SURFACE ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES (SEW) ALONG, RATHER THAN PERPENDICULAR TO, THE ELECTROCATALYST SURFACE. ELECTRON SCATTERING FROM VARIOUS SURFACE PHASES OF THE ELECTROCATALYST (SURFACE OXIDES, HYDRIDES, AND ADSORBATES) ATTENUATE THE SEW AS IT PROPAGATES ALONG THE SURFACE. CALCULATION OF A TRANSFER FUNCTION FOR THE INPUT AND ATTENUATED SEW PROVIDES A FREQUENCY DEPENDENT SURFACE IMPEDANCE. IN A REFINEMENT OF THE SEW IMPEDANCE TECHNIQUE, CROSS POWER AND FAST FOURIER TRANSFORM FUNCTIONS ARE USED TO CALCULATE THE SIMULTANEOUS SURFACE IMPEDANCE RESPONSE TO A MULTIPLE FREQUENCY INPUT SIGNAL. THIS APPROACH ALLOWS THE RAPID EXAMINATION OF A WIDE FREQUENCY SPECTRUM OF SURFACE IMPEDANCE FEATURES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ELECTROCATALYST STABILITY AND SURFACE PHASES IMPORTANT TO EFFICIENT ELECTROCATALYSIS.",

THE CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT WILL UTILIZE AN INTEGRATED MULTI-ELEMENT AIRFOIL SYSTEM TO BE DESIGNED TO FORM A SLOT BETWEEN THE UPPER AND LOWER SURFACE IN THE TURBULENT RECOVERY REGIONS. THIS SLOT BRINGS HIGHER ENERGY AIR FROM THE LOWER SURFACE TO RE-ENERGIZE THE TURBULENT BOUNDARY LAYER ON THE UPPER SURFACE. ALSO BECAUSE OF THE INTERACTION OF THE ELEMENTS FORMED BY THIS SLOT, THERE ARE ADDED BENEFITS IN REDUCING THE ONSET OF TURBULENT BOUNDARY LAYER SEPARATION. THE PRESSURE AT THE TRAILING EDGE OF THE MAIN ELEMENT IS REDUCED WHILE THE MAXIMUM VELOCITIES ON THE FLAP ARE REDUCED. BOTH THESE EFFECTS REDUCE THE TOTAL PRESSURE RISE IN THE RECOVERY REGIONS. THIS NEW NLF AIRFOIL IS TO BE DEVELOPED ITERATIVELY, BASED ON THE VIKEN-PFENNINGER NLF (1)-0414F AIRFOIL WITH 70% CHORD LAMINAR FLOW; USING POTENTIAL FLOW, BOUNDARY LAYER, AND LAMINAR FLOW STABILITY COMPUTER CODES. EMPHASIS WILL BE MADE TO GET EXTENSIVE LAMINAR FLOW FOR AS WIDE A LIFT RANGE AS POSSIBLE AND TO GET ACCEPTABLE ACCELERATION THRUGH THE SLOT AT NOT ONLY THE HIGH CLIMB LIFT COEFFICIENTS BUT ALSO AT THE LOW CRUISE LIFT COEFFICIENTS WHEN THERE IS VERY LITTLE PRESSURE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SURFACES.

        "abstract": "Abstract         EXFLUOR RESEARCH CORPORATION ALONG WITH PROFESSOR RICHARD J. LAGOW AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN HAVE DEVELOPED A NEW SYNTHETIC METHOD FOR PREPARING FLUOROCARBON MEMBRANE MATERIAL. THE PROCEDURE CONSISTS OF FIRST SYNTHESIZING A HYDROCARBON PRECURSOR, INTRODUCING CROSS-LINKS AND THEN FLUORINATING WITH ELEMENTAL FLUORINE. THIS METHOD PERMITS WIDE FLEXIBILITY IN THE STRUCTURAL FEATURES OF THE MEMBRANE. WE HAVE PREPARED MEMBRANES WITH BOTH ISOLATED AND VICINAL CARBOXYLIC ACID FUNCTIONS BY THIS METHOD. IN THIS EXAMPLE A POLYETHYLENE MATRIX WITH THE APPROPRIATE FUNCTIONAL GROUPS WAS PREPARED, CROSS-LINKED WITH RADIATION AND FLUORINATED TO CONVERT C-H TO C-F BONDS. THE MEMBRANES OBTAINED FROM THIS PREPARATION AFTER HYDROLYSIS IN AQUEOUS ACID WERE SHOWN TO BE CONDUCTIVE. CONDUCTIVITIES OF 5 OHM/CM(1) HAVE ALREADY BEEN OBTAINED VALUES OF 3 OHM/CM(1) ARE THOUGHT TO BE READILY ATTAINABLE. THE SUCCESS OF THE \"OXYFLUORINATION\" PROCESS FOR MAKING FUNCTIONALIZED POLYMERS HAS ALREADY BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN PROFESSOR LAGOW'S ACADEMIC LABORATORY. USING FURTHER TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED AT EXFLUOR RESEARCH CORPORATION, NEW CANDIDATES FOR ION-EXCHANGE MEMBRANES WILL BE EXAMINED. FILMS ALREADY PREPARED BY THIS METHOD HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE RESISTANCES OF LESS THAN 5 OHM-CM(2) AND ARE STABLE IN AGGRESIVE ENVIRONMENTS. THE DEGREE OF CROSS-LINKING WILL BE VARIED AND THE EFFECTS ON MEMBRANE PERFORMANCE WILL BE DETERMINED. ADDITIONAL ATTENTION WILL BE GIVEN TO THE FILM-FORMING CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FUNCTIONALIZED POLYMERS. BONDING PROPERTIES TO TEFLON WILL ALSO BE EXAMINED FOR USE IN INCREASING THE MECHANICAL STRENGTH OF THE POLYMER FILM.",

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PHASE I EFFORTS ARE TO IDENTIFY THE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS, INVESTIGATE THE TECHNICAL FEASI BILITY OF THE DEVELOPED CONCEPT AND DESIGN A PROTOTYPE SYSTEM INCLUDING A PARTICLE (INLET) SAMPLING SYSTEM FOR POTENTIAL AIRCRAFT USAGE, IDENTIFY LIGHT SOURCE, OPTICS AND DETECTORS FOR THE SYSTEM, AND A DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEM. THE PROPOSED APPROCH IS TO MEASURE THE SPECTRAL AND ANGULAR VARIATION OF SCATTERED LIGHT PATTERNS OF INDIVIDUAL PARTICLES OVER 4 STERADIANS BY EMPLOYING MULTIPLE SOURCES AND DETECTORS AND A FAST RESPONSE DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEM. PHASE I RESULTS ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE DETAILS OF SYSTEM DESIGN, HARDWARE IDENTIFICATION AND THEORETICAL ANALYSIS THAT WILL DIRECT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PHASE II - THE ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION OF THE SYSTEM.",

THE FREQUENCY VARIATIONS ARE SAMPLED BY A MICROPROCESSOR. BY FITTING A NOSE CONE TO THE SENSOR, ALTERNATIVELY, IT MAY BE OPERATED IN THE PITOT-TUBE MODE. BECAUSE OF THE HIGH SENSOR RESOLUTION, THE SENSOR CAN OPERATE OVER A WIDE RANGE (TURNDOWN RATIO 140:1) WITH A FLOW RATE UNCERTAINTY OF LESS THAN 1%.

THE CONVENTIONAL MECHANICAL SLIP-RING DEVICES ARE SPEED, NOISE, SIZE AND LIFE-TIME LIMITED. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS EFFORT IS TO DEVELOP A HIGH-SPEED, ELECTRO-OPTIC SLIP RING DEVICE THAT WILL EXPAND THE POTENTIAL CAPABILITY FOR ANALYSIS WITH ROTATING OR MOVING SYSTEMS AND FORM THE BASIS FOR A COMMERCIAL DEVICE. THE PHASE I TASK SHALL DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF AN OPTICAL SLIP-RING DEVICE BASED ON THE INTEGRATION OF HIGH-SPEED ELECTRO-OPTICAL COMPONENTS WITH AN OPTICAL LINK FOR DATA TRANSFER FROM A ROTATING SHAFT. MODULAR COMPONENTS THAT FORM THE BASIC ELEMENTS OF THE SLIP-RING WILL FIRST BE DEVELOPED AND TESTED (MULTIPLEX/DEMULTIPLEX MODULES, A HIGH SPEED MODULATED SOURCE AND RECEIVER AND A OPTICAL LINK) AND THEN INTEGRATED INTO A LABORATORY MOCKUP OF A ROTATING SHAFT SYSTEM TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF THE OPTICAL SLIP-RING CONCEPT. THIS DATA WILL IDENTIFY BASIC COMPONENTS, NEEDS FOR SPECIAL COMPACT HYBRID CIRCUITS, DIRECTIONS FOR PHASE II AND APPLICATION AREAS FOR A UNIVERSAL SLIP-RING DEVICE.",

IN SOME REGIONS THIS RAPID INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF RESISTANT STRAINS HAS HEIGHTENED THE CONCERN OF PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES AND HAS RESULTED IN REVISED METHODS OF CONTROL. IF THE SPREAD OF RESISTANT STRAINS IS NOT ADEQUATELY CONTROLLED, THIS FAILURE WILL BE REFLECTED IN HIGHER INCIDENCES OF DISEASE AND INCREASED COSTS OF TREATMENT WITH ALTERNATIVE ANTIBIOTICS. ONE IMPROVEMENT IN THE METHODS FOR CONTROL WOULD BE TO PROVIDE A MEANS OF MORE RAPID BACTERIAL DETECTION AND IDENTIFICATION OF RESISTANCE FACTORS. THIS METHOD MUST BE FASTER THAN THE 2-4 DAYS NECESSARY FOR CULTURE-DEPENDENT TECHNIQUES BUT POSSESS A SIMILAR DEGREE OF ACCURACY AND SENSITIVITY. WE INTEND TO DEVELOP A DIRECT, CULTURE-INDEPENDENT ASSAY UTILIZING MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES. SINCE RESISTANCE IS CONFERRED BY UNIQUE, PLASMID-ENCODED PROTEINS (I.E., BETA-LACTAMASE) TARGET MOLECULES CAN BE IDENTIFIED BY A SENSITIVE IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE ASSAY TO STAIN INDIVIDUAL BACTERIA IN A DIRECT PATIENT SMEAR. FOR THIS PURPOSE, WE WILL UTILIZE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES DIRECTED AGAINST TWO \"FUNCTIONAL\" TARGETS. THE FIRST WILL PROVIDE THE PHYLOGENETIC IDENTIFICATION OF THE BACTERIA (I.E., ANTIBODIES TO MEMBRANE PROTEINS OR LPS), AND THE SECOND WILL IDENTIFY THE SPECIFIC PLASMID-ENCODED RESISTANCE FACTOR (I.E., ANTIBODY TO BETA-LACTAMASE). PATIENT SPECIMEN WILL BE SMEARED ONTO MICROSCOPE SLIDES, FIXED, AND STAINED WITH THE ANTIBODIES. THE SLIDES WILL THEN BE SCANNED UNDER A FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPE FOR THE PRESENCE OF STAINED ORGANISMS. SINCE BETA-LACTAMASE ACCUMULATE IN THE PERIPLASMIC SPACES BETWEEN THE CELL WALL AND OUTER MEMBRANE, IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY THE BACTERIA POSSESSING THE RESISTANCE FACTOR BY A CHARACTERISTIC STAINING MORPHOLOGY. WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO PERFORM THE TEST IN LESS THAN AN HOUR WITH A DEGREE OF SENSITIVITY AND ACCURACY COMPARABLE TO CULTURE.",

MULTIPLEX GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY OFFERS A TECHNIQUE FOR TECHNIQUE FOR CONTINUOUS REAL-TIME ANALYSIS, AND AT THE SAME TIME THE POTENTIAL FOR INCREASED SENSITIVITY, BOTH HIGHLY ADVANTAGEOUS. MULTIPLEX OPERATION REQUIRES CONTINUOUS INTRODUCTION OF SAMPLE GAS TO THE CHROMATOGRAPH, WITH SOME TYPE OF MODULATION OF THE CONCENTRATION, AND A DEMODULATION OF THE CHROMATOGRAPHIC DETECTOR OUTPUT, WHICH IS OTHERWISE UNINTELLIGIBLE. WE PROPOSE TO TEST THE APPLICABILITY OF MULTIPLEX GC TO A REAL GEOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS NOW CARRIED OUT BY A MANUAL BATCH INJECTION PROCEDURE THAT SOMETIMES REQUIRES PRECONCENTRATION BY FREEZEOUT. WE WILL TEST SAMPLE MODULATION BY PULSED HEATING OF A SHORT INLET SEGMENT OF THE COLUMN, AND BY SWITCHED REVERSAL OF SAMPLE AND CARRIER GAS STREAMS, BOTH COMPUTER-CONTROLLED, AND WILL OPTIMIZE CONDITIONS FOR BOTH METHODS.

SINTER/HIP IS AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO MATERIALS CONSOLIDATION WHICH INCORPORATES SINTERING AND CONTAINERLESS HIP'ING (HOT ISOSTATIC PRESSING) INTO A SINGLE, UNINTERRUPTED CYCLE CONDUCTED IN A HIP SYSTEM. IN THIS PROPOSED PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, GREEN PREFORMS ARE SINTERED UNDER MODERATE N2 PRESSURE TO HIGH DENSITY AND CLOSED POROSITY IN THE HIP VESSEL; FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF THE DESIGNATED SINTERING PHASE OF THE CYCLE, THE VESSEL IS RAPIDLY PRESSURIZED TO A SUITABLE HIP'ING PRESSURE (E.G., 30 KPSI), AND THE HIP PHASE OF THE CYCLE IS THEN CONDUCTED. SINTER/HIP THUS DIFFERS FROM THE \"CONVENTIONAL\" CONCEPT OF CONTAINERLESS HIP'ING, SINCE SINTER/HIP DOES NOT REQUIRE OR EMPLOY SEPARATE SINTERING AND HIP'ING SYSTEMS. ADDITIONALLY, SINTER/HIP MAKES POSSIBLE PROCESSING CONDITIONS DIFFERENT FROM THOSE USED IN THE \"CONVENTIONAL\" SINTER + CONTAINERLESS HIP APPROACH. THUS SINTER/HIP MAY YIELD TECHNICALLY UNIQUE MATERIALS WITH PROPERTIES AND MICROSTRUCTURES UNLIKE THOSE PRODUCED VIA OTHER PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES. THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL AIM AT FULLY DENSIFYING A 92 WT.% SI3N4 + 6 WT.% Y2O3 + 2 WT.% AL2O3 SIALON VIA SINTER/HIP. ROOM TEMPERATURE MODULUS OF RUPTURE VALUES FOR SINTER/HIP'ED SPECIMENS WILL BE GENERATED AND COMPARED WITH MOR VALUES FOR COMPOSITIONALLY SIMILAR SINTERED AND SINTERED + CONTAINERLESS HIP'ED SPECIMENS.",

THERE ARE OVER 100,000 CHILDREN WITH A PARENT WITH ESRD. CURRENT STUDIES SHOW THAT THESE CHILDREN DEVELOP DEPRESSIVE AND HYPOCHONDRIACAL MMPI PATTERNS, PSEUDOMATURE BEHAVIOR, AND HAVE LATENT AGGRESSIVE FEELINGS TOWARD THE SICK PARENT. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A WORKBOOK, TEST THE WORKBOOK ON LOCAL CHILDREN WITH ESRD PARENTS, MODIFY THE WORKBOOK BASED ON THE RESPONSES FROM THE CHILDREN, AND PUBLISH IT DURING PHASE I. THE WORKBOOK WILL BE DEVELOPED WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF DIALYSIS CENTERS AND PROFESSIONALS INCLUDING: A CHILD PSYCHIATRIST, SOCIAL WORKER, RENAL NURSE, MEDICAL WRITERS, AND AN ILLUSTRATOR. THE WORKBOOK WILL BE ORIENTED TOWARD ONE OF THE CHILD DEVELOPMENT STAGES OF LIFE. AT THE CONCLUSION OF PHASE I, WE WILL IDENTIFY OTHER MEDICALLY RELATED AREAS THAT CAN BENEFIT FROM SIMILAR CHILD-ORIENTED LITERATURE AND WE WILL PROPOSE TO DEVELOP MATERIALS FOR THESE AREAS DURING PHASE II. ALSO IN PHASE II, WE WILL PREPARE WORKBOOKS ON ESRD FOR THE OTHER DEVELOPMENT STAGES.",

AN EVALUATION, WITH NONLINEAR ACOUSTICAL ANALYSIS, OF THIS NEW, NONINTRUSIVE, TECHNIQUE FOR ACCURACY AND LIMITATIONS IS PROPOSED IN ORDER TO PROVE THE FEASIBILITY OF THE ACOUSTICAL RESONANCE MEASUREMENT. EVALUATIONS OF THE EFFECTS OF VARIATIONS IN DISTRIBUTION OF COAL IN THE CROSS-SECTION, DISTRIBUTION OF PARTICLE SIZES, VELOCITY PROFILE, AND VARIATION OF COAL TYPE ARE PROPOSED. THESE ANALYSES WILL DETERMINE THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THIS NEW TECHNIQUE WILL PROVIDE A SUITABLE DETERMINATION OF THE PARTICULATE MASS LOADING UNDER CONDITIONS OF PULVERIZED COAL-FIRED POWER PLANTS. THE ACOUSTICAL RESONANCE MEASUREMENT CAN PROVIDE A NONINTRUSIVE AND REAL-TIME MEASUREMENT OF THE MASS LOADING OF PARTICLES FLUIDIZED BY A GAS PHASE.

BOTH ARE RECOMMENDED BY THE NCI'S DIVISION OF CANCER BIOLOGY AND DIAGNOSIS IN THE OMNIBUS SOLICITATION SINCE THEY WILL MAKE POSSIBLE THE USE OF HUMAN CELL-DERIVED MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES FOR CANCER DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPY. MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES PRODUCED BY THE HYBRIDOMA TECHNIQUE OF KOHLER AND MILSTEIN HAVE ALREADY BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE BOTH DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC APPLICATION. IN TUMOR MODELS, MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES CONJUGATED TO RADIONUCLIDES, CYTOTOXIC DRUGS OR TOXINS, OR EVEN UNCONJUGATED HAVE DEMONSTRATED INHIBITION OF TUMOR GROWTH AND IN SOME CASES REGRESSION OF ESTABLISHED TUMORS. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE NON-AVAILABILITY OF A NON-SECRETORY, HAT-SENSITIVE IN VITRO ADAPTED HUMAN MYELOMA LINE FOR HUMAN-HUMAN FUSIONS, THE ANTIBODIES UTILIZED HAVE BEEN FOR THE MOST PART OF MOUSE ORIGIN. THE MULTIPLE INJECTION OF FOREIGN PROTEINS SUCH AS MOUSE ANTIBODIES MAY RESULT IN AN ANAPHYLAXIS, IMMUNE COMPLEX VASCULITIS, AND/OR THE PRODUCTION OF BLOCKING ANTIBODIES IN THE PATIENT. THESE PROBLEMS WOULD THEORETICALLY BE REDUCED OR ELIMINATED IN A HUMAN-HUMAN SYSTEM. DURING PHASE I OF THIS STUDY HAT-SENSITIVE MUTANTS WILL BE DEVELOPED FROM A CELL LINE, K737 (LOZZIO) WHICH WAS DERIVED FROM THE PLEURAL EFFUSION OF A PATIENT WITH MULTIPLE MYELOMA. THE K737 CELLS WILL UNDERGO B-AZAGUANINE TREATMENT IN SEMI-SOLID AGAR TO DEVELOP THE HAT-SENSITIVE HPRT DEFICIENT (HPRT) MUTANTS. DURING PHASE II THE HAT-SENSITIVE HPRT MUTANTS SELECTED FROM PHASE I WILL BE FURTHER CHARACTERIZED AS TO GROWTH PROPERTIES, MORPHOLOGY AND FUSION EFFICIENCY. THE CELL LINE WILL UNDERGO FURTHER MUTATION IN ORDER TO SELECT FOR A HAT-SENSITIVE, HPRT MUTANT THAT DOES NOT SECRETE IMMUNOGLOBULIN. IMMUNOGLOBULIN LEVELS WILL BE TESTED BY THE PI WHILE KARYOLOGY STUDIES WILL BE DONE BY DR. LOZZIO. ALSO, DURING PHASE I AND II, A TISSUE CULTURE MEDIUM BASED ON HYBRIDOMA SCIENCES' LOW SERUM MEDIUM (HSI-LOSM) WILL BE DEVELOPED TO GROW THE CELLS WITHOUT CONDITIONED MEDIUM AND FETAL BOVINE SERUM. THE MEDIUM WILL BE FURTHER TESTED AGAINST VARIOUS OTHER CELL LINES WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON SUPPORTING THE GROWTH OF ESTABLISHED HYBRIDOMAS OF BOTH HUMAN AND MOUSE ORIGIN.

THE SUPERIOR PROPERTIES OF THE LAVES PHASE V-ZR-HF SUPERCONDUCTORS INCLUDE CRITICAL FIELDS IN EXCESS 20 TESLA, INCREASED MATERIAL DUCTILITY, CRITICAL CURRENT DENSITITES COMPARABLE TO THOSE SEEN IN NO ELASTIC STRAIN DEGREDATION OF CRITICAL CURRENT AND AN INCREASED RESISTENCE TO RADIATION DAMAGE OVER CONVENTIONAL A15 (I.E. NB3SN) TYPE SUPERVCONDUCTORS. COMPARED TO CURRENTLY AVAILABLE A15 SUPERCONDUCTORS WHICH EXHIBIT AN INHERENT BRITTLENESS AND STRAIN SENSITIVITY, THESE C15 LAVES PHASE SUPERCONDUCTORS DO NOT EXHIBIT SUCH PROPERTIES; THEREFORE OFFERING THE MAGNET DESIGNER MUCH MORE FREEDOM TO OPTIMIZE HIS DESIGNS.

COLON AND RECTAL CANCER HAS SURPASSED LUNG CANCER AS THE NUMBER ONE CANCER KILLER IN THE UNITED STATES. MOST INVESTIGATORS FEEL THAT OCCULT BLEEDING IS THE MOST FREQUENT CONSEQUENCE AND MOST PREDICTIVE INDICATOR OF THE PRESENCE OF TUMOR. THE HIGH MORTALITY RATE OF NEAR 60% MAKES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A DIAGNOSTIC TEST FOR THIS CANCER OF EXTREME IMPORTANCE SINCE EARLY DETECTION IS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH CURE RATES. A NUMBER OF TESTS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO DETECT OCCULT HEMAGLOBIN IN STOOLS. THESE INCLUDE THE DILUTE TINCTURE OF GUAIAC, SATURATED GUAIAC, HEMASTAT, AND HEMOCCULT TEST. IN ADDITION, THE PUNCH-DISC RADIAL IMMUNODIFFUSION TECHNIQUE HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AND HAS DEMONSTRATED GREATER SENSITIVITY THAN THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED TESTS AS WELL AS A DEGREE OF SPECIFICITY NOT FOUND IN THE PREVIOUS TESTS. WE WILL DEVELOP A PUNCH-DISC ENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY (ELISA) FOR THE DETECTION OF OCCULT HEMAGLOBIN IN STOOLS. THE SENSITIVITY OF THE ASSAY SHOULD BE CLEARLY SUPERIOR TO THAT OF EXISTING TESTS. BECAUSE OF ITS GREATER SENSITIVITY, THE PUNCH-DISC ELISA WILL ALLOW DETECTION OF HEMAGLOBIN ANTIGENS AT AN EARLIER STAGE OF COLON CANCER DEVELOPMENT THAN THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED TESTS. AN INCREASED SURVIVOR RATE SHOULD RESULT FROM THE EARLIER DETECTION OF COLON CANCER. THIS NEWLY DEVELOPED PUNCH-DISC ELISA WILL BE EVALUATED CRITICALLY IN TERMS OF STANDARDIZATION, SENSITIVITY, SPECIFICITY, AND REPRODUCIBILITY. THESE CHARACTERISTICS ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE QUALITY CONTROL OF THE ASSAY. THE FINDINGS IN PHASE I OF THIS STUDY WILL BE USED TO PLAN THE DEMONSTRATION IN PHASE II OF THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THE PUNCH-DISC ELISA AS A DIAGNOSTIC TECHNIQUE FOR THE EARLY DETECTION OF COLON CANCER AND OTHER CAUSES OF ALIMENTARY TRACT BLEEDING. THE DETECTION OF BLEEDING FROM NONCANCEROUS LESIONS COULD BE AN IMPORTANT AID IN THE CURE-RATE OF THESE LESIONS. THE PUNCH-DISC ELISA IS A SPECIFIC, SENSITIVE, ACCURATE, AND SIMPLE SCREENING PROCEDURE THAT CAN BE OF SIGNIFICANT VALUE TO PRACTIONERS, CLINICS, AND OTHER LABORATORIES AS A QUANTITATIVE ASSAY CAPABLE OF DETECTING HEMAGLOBIN ANTIGEN IN THE NANNOGRAM RANGE. AS A COLORMETRIC ASSAY, THE ELISA OFFERS THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING ADAPTABLE TO A SIMPLE AND INEXPENSIVE OFFICE AND HOME TEST.",

THIS WILL BE CARRIED OUT AFTER THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE IN VIVO ANIMAL MODEL. NEXT, THE COMMON ANTIGENIC STRUCTURES OF N.

IN THE PRESENT INVESTIGATION, PURIFIED STAPHYLOCOCCAL PROTEIN A IS ISOLATED, COUPLED TO AN INERT BIOCOMPATIBLE SILICA SUBSTRATE, HOUSED IN A DISPOSABLE CARTRIDGE, STERILIZED AND USED TO TREAT MALIGNANCY. A SIMILAR SYSTEM HAS BEEN UTILIZED BY INVESTIGATORS AND RESULTED IN OBJECTIVE TUMOR REGRESSIONS IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST ADENOCARCINOMA (BENSINGER ET AL., NEW ENG. J. MED. 306: 935, 1982). PATIENTS TO BE STUDIED IN THIS RESEARCH GRANT PROPOSAL WILL HAVE STAGE II BREAST CANCER AND STAGE II MELANOMA. IDEAL PATIENTS WILL HAVE LOCAL SKIN METASTASES OR RECURRENCE THAT CAN BE DIRECTLY OBSERVED FOR ANTI-TUMOR EFFECTS AND CAN BE BIOPSIED. IN THE SIX MONTH PERIOD COVERED BY THIS PROPOSAL, IT IS ESTIMATED THAT 14 PATIENTS COULD BE TREATED AND STUDIED EMPLOYING EXTRACORPOREAL PROTEIN A IMMUNOADSORPTION. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY ARE TO COLLECT PATIENT SERA BEFORE AND DURING EXTRACORPOREAL IMMUNOADSORPTION AND TO ANALYZE THE SERA FOR QUANTITATIVE CHANGES IN IMMUNOGLOBULIN LEVELS, TOTAL HEMOLYTIC COMPLEMENT LEVELS, CIRCULATING IMMUNE COMPLEXES, AND TUMOR IMMUNITY (WHEN APPROPRIATE). THESE IMMUNOLOGIC PARAMETERS WILL BE ASSESSED IN ASSOCIATION WITH PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS, MEASUREMENT OF OBJECTIVE TUMOR (WHEN APPROPRIATE), AND X-RAYS OF AREAS OF TUMOR INVOLVEMENT. IN ADDITION, PROTEIN(S) BOUND TO THE PROTEIN A IMMUNOADSORPTION WILL BE ANALYZED FOR THE PRESENCE OF IMMUNOGLOBULIN, COMPLEMENT COMPONENTS, AND IMMUNE COMPLEXES. THESE ANALYSES WILL ENABLE US TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS A MODIFICATION IN THE BIOLOGIC RESPONSE AS A RESULT OF EXTRACORPOREAL PROTEIN A IMMUNOADSORPTION WHICH IS ASSOCIATED WITH CLINICAL IMPROVEMENT AND WILL ASSIST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SAFE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE TREATMENT DEVICE. THIS IS A STUDY TO EVALUATE THE TUMOR BEARING PATIENT BEFORE AND AFTER EXTRACORPOREAL TREATMENT IN A BASIC RESEARCH PHASE I PROPOSAL WITH SPECIFIC AIMS DIRECTED TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SAFE AND EFFICACIOUS TREATMENT UNIT AND PRELIMINARY ELUCIDATION OF POSSIBLE MODE(S) OF ACTION.",

TO ACCOMPLISH THIS OBJECTIVE, INTRON, INC. INTENDS TO DEVELOP ORGANISM/ANTIGEN SPECIFIC TRANSFER FACTORS BY IMMUNIZING PREGNANT DAIRY COWS. INTRON, INC. SCIENTISTS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT COWS WITH PRE-EXISTING CELLULAR IMMUNE RESPONSIVENESS TO CERTAIN MICROORGANISMS WILL HARBOR TF'S SPECIFIC FOR THESE ORGANISMS IN POST-PARTURITION COLOSTRUM (AND MILK). COLOSTRUM POTENTIALLY REPRESENTS AN INEXPENSIVE RICH SOURCE OF TF. IT IS NOT KNOWN, HOWEVER, WHEN OR BY WHAT ROUTE A COW MUST BE IMMUNIZED IN ORDER TO INDUCE THE ACCUMULATION OF A PARTICULAR ORGANISM SPECIFIC TF IN COLOSTRUM. PHASE I RESEARCH WILL ADDRESS: (A) THE IMMUNIZATION ROUTE TO BE USED, AND (B) THE NUMBER OF IMMUNIZATIONS AND THEIR TEMPORAL RELATIONSHIP TO PARTURITION. IN PHASE II, INTRON, INC. WILL EMPLOY THE INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM PHASE I TO BULK PRODUCE CERTAIN TF'S IN BOVINE'S FOR USE IN DOUBLE-BLIND CLINICAL TRIALS TO DOCUMENT THE EFFICIENCY OF THIS IMMUNE POTENTIATOR IN SELECTED HUMAN AND VETERINARIAN DISEASES WHICH HAVE A MAJOR SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACT.",

THIS SEARCH HAS LED TO THE DISCOVERY OF SEVERAL OTHER CARCINOFETAL PROTEINS SUCH AS VARIENTS OF CEA AND ALPHA FETOPROTEINS. THE TUMOR MARKER, TENNESSEE ANTIGEN, APPEARS TO DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM CEA IN MOLECULAR WEIGHT, MOBILITY IN IMMUNOELECTROPHORESIS, CARBOHYDRATE RESIDUE CONTENTS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IN ANTIGENICITY. THE CLINICAL EVALUATION OF THE ANTIGEN HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED USING A HEMAGGLUTINATION INHIBITION ASSAY (TENNAGEN ASSAY). THE STATISTICAL EVALUATION OF 7300 ASSAYS HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED AND APPEARS TO BE VERY PROMISING IN COLORECTAL AND LUNG CANCERS. THE REFINEMENT OF MEASUREMENT OF LEVELS OF TENNESSEE ANTIGEN USING THE ENZYME IMMUNOASSAY METHODOLOGY WILL INCREASE THE MARKER'S USE IN MONITORING CLINICAL COURSES OF TREATMENT. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO UTILIZE AVAILABLE TENNESSEE ANTIGEN AND ANTIBODY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ENZYME IMMUNOASSAY AND TO EVALUATE THE SENSITIVITY AND VALUE OF THE MARKER WHEN USING A MORE SENSITIVE METHODOLOGY THAN HEMAGGLUTINATION INHIBITION. THE ENZYME IMMUNOASSAY WILL ALLOW EXPANSION OF THE SCALE OF VALUES SO THAT ONE WOULD HAVE A GREATER DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN A NEGATIVE RANGE AND A POSITIVE RANGE AS COMPARED TO THE RANGE ALLOWED BY THE HEMAGGLUTINATION INHIBITION ASSAY. THE READABILITY OF THE ASSAY BY ELECTRONIC APPARATUS WILL BE MORE RELIABLE AND CONSISTENT BETWEEN USERS THAN THE HEMAGGLUTINATION INHIBITION ASSAY WHICH RELIES ON VISUAL INTERPRETATION.",

TO FULLY SEPARATE THE FORCES AND RESPONSES, THE WIND SENSORS MUST HAVE A RESPONSE TIME SHORTER THAN EITHER THE PILOT OR VEHICLE REACTION TIMES. THIS PROPOSAL DESCRIBES AN AIR VELOCITY SENSING TECHNIQUE WHICH DETECTS THE VORTICES THAT ARE SHED FROM A SMALL ROD HELD IN THE AIRSTREAM. THE VORTEX SHED FREQUENCY IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE AIR VELOCITY AND WITH A SMALL VORTEX ROD SIZE, VORTEX FREQUENCIES OF SEVERAL THOUSAND PER SECOND ARE OBTAINED. SINCE EACH VORTEX IS AN INDEPENDENT MEASURE OF THE AIRSPEED DURING ITS FORMATION,RESPONSE TIMES OF LESS THAN ONE MILLISECOND CAN BE OBTAIN. THE WIND VECTORS WILL BE SEPARATED INTO TWO COMPONENTS AND EACH COMPONENT MEASURED. THE VORTICES ARE DETECTED USING AN ULTRASONIC IMAGING TECHNIQUE. INSTRUMENTS USING THIS TECHNIQUE HAVE BEEN TEST FLOWN ON HELICOPTERS AS AIRSPEED AND DIRECTION SENSORS. HOWEVER, IN THOSE APPLICATIONS, RESPONSE TIMES WERE NOT CRITICAL. THE SAME SENSING TECHNIQUE HAS BEEN USED IN AUTOMOBILE AIR INTAKE SENSORS WHERE RESPONSE TIMES OF LESS THAN 10 MILLISECONDS WERE MEASURED. THIS LENDS PROMISE THAT THE AIRSPEED SENSOR, COMBINED WITH THE FAST PROCESSING OF THE AUTOMOBILE SENSOR WILL FULFILL THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS PROGRAM.",

TO DATE, ALL SUFFER IN NOT BEING ABLE TO DEPOSIT THE CORRECT AMOUNT OF HEAT TO THE TUMOR SITE WITH MINIMAL INTERFERENCE TO NORMAL TISSUE IN AN ACCURATE AND CONTROLLED FASHION. AS A RESULT, HYPERTHERMIA TREATMENT OF DEEP TUMORS HAS BEEN LARGELY IGNORED. A SCANNING FOCUSSED BEAM ULTRASOUND HYPERTHERMIA DELIVERY SYSTEM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED BY THE PROPOSERS FOR THE TREATMENT OF DEEP TUMORS. AT PRESENT, THIS SYSTEM FEATURES TEMPERATURE MONITORING WITHIN THE TUMOR VOLUME USING THERMOCOUPLES, FLYING SPOT HEATING, AND CONTINUOUS RECORDING OF IMPORTANT PARAMETERS. CRITICAL FOR THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS SYSTEM IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODELS WHICH CAN PROVIDE IN REAL TIME 3-D TEMPERATURE PROFILES. THESE MODELS MUST INCLUDE TEMPERATURE DATA AT SELECTED POINTS, AND PROVIDE FOR REAL TIME FEEDBACK CONTROL BY INTENSITY MODULATION OF THE ULTRASONIC BEAM. THE METHOD OF ATTACK UNDER DEVELOPMENT IS TO ADOPT SIMPLE MODELS WHICH RETAIN THE BASIC HEAT TRANSFER PROCESSES AND GEOMETRY AND YET ALLOW APPROXIMATE TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS THE METHOD OF WEIGHTED RESIDUALS, TO BE APPLIED FOR THE SOLUTION. CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION WILL BE PLACED ON HANDLING BLOOD FLOW AND THE POWER SOURCE TERM WHICH BECOMES TEMPERATURE DEPENDENT BY VIRTUE OF THE FEEDBACK CONTROL. PROGRESS TO DATE INDICATES THE APPROACH TO BE SOUND. THE RESEARCH PROPOSED IN PHASE I IS CRUCIAL FOR THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF A SOPHISTICATED HYPERTHERMIA DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR CLINICAL USE. SIMPLE 1-D MODELS ALREADY DEVELOPED BY THE RESEARCHERS WILL BE EXTENDED TO 3-D AND TO GEOMETRIES MORE REPRESENTIVE OF IN VIVO TUMORS.

THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF DAMAGE ASSESSMENT BY INTEGRATING EXISTING INFORMATION AND RESERCH ACTIVITIES IN THE AREAS OF GROUND RADARAND SEISMIC SYSTEMS, GEOSTATISTICS, AND COMPUTERIZED MAPPING INTO THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF A DAMAGE ASSESSMENT SYSTEM. A COMPUTERIZED MAPPING INTO THE CONCEPTUAL OF A DAMAGE ASSESSMENT SYSTEM. A COMPUTERIZED ANALYTICAL MODEL OF SYSTEM PERFORMANCE WILL BE DEVELOP ED AND APPLIED TO EVALUATE CANDIDATE SYSTEM CONFIGURATIONS. THE MODEL WILL BE EXERCISED TO EVALUATE PERFORMANCE OF THESE SYSTEMS IN CONJUNCTION WITH GEOLOGIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DEEP BASE AND RELATED DAMAGE SCENARIOS. THE RESULTS OF THE PHASE I RESEARCH WILL ESTALISH THOSE SYSTEM CONFIGURATIONS FOR WHICH ENGINEERING DESIGN AND EVALUATION ARE TO BE CONDUCTED DURING THE PHASE II RESEARCH PROGRAM.",

PADS HAVE MULTIPLE POTENTIAL USES AND HAVE BEEN STUDIED EXTENSIVELY IN RELATION TO PERMANENTLY IMPLANTED PROSTHESES THAT AUGMENT THE ACTION OF THE FAILING HEART. PRESENT CARDIAC ASSIST SYSTEMS DEPEND ON ELECTRICAL OR PNEUMATIC POWER, WHICH MUST BE TRANSMITTED ACROSS OR THROUGH THE SKIN. AS YET, HOWEVER, A PAD THAT IS RELIABLE IN LONG-TERM USE HAS NOT BEEN DEVELOPED. TO PREVENT INFECTION, THE MAJOR CAUSE OF PAD FAILURE, WE POSTULATE THAT PAD DESIGN MUST PROVIDE FOR (1) CONTROL OF EPIDERMAL PROLIFERATION AND MIGRATION IN PROXIMITY TO THE IMPLANT, AND (2) ATTENUATION OF LOCAL STRAIN. A PAD HYPOTHESIZED TO MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS IS BEING STUDIED IN RATS AND SWINE. ITS NECK (THE TRANSCUTANEOUS PORTION) IS NANOPOROUS; A DACRON VELOUR-COVERED FLANGE JOINED TO THE NECK IS PLACED SUBDERMALLY. PRIOR TO IMPLANTATION, AUTOLOGOUS FIBROBLASTS ARE CULTURED ONTO THE PAD NECK, FORMING A MULTILAYER COATING. THE RESULTS TO DATE INDICATE THAT PADS PREPARED IN THIS WAY INHIBIT EPITHELIAL DOWNGROWTH, WHEREAS UNCOATED IMPLANTS FAIL AS A RESULT OF EPIDERMAL MIGRATION AND INFECTION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PHASE I PROJECT IS TO TRANSFER AND EXTEND TO SHEEP (WHICH INCREASINGLY ARE USED FOR FULL-SCALE TESTING OF CARDIAC ASSIST SYSTEMS) THE METHODS EVOLVED IN SWINE. SPECIFIC AIMS ARE: (1) TO ADAPT TECHNIQUES FOR IN VITRO FIBROBLAST PROLIFERATION AND COLLAGEN PRODUCTION ON THE PAD NECK TO SHEEP CELLS; (2) TO ADAPT SURGICAL TECHNIQUES FOR PAD IMPLANTATION TO SHEEP; AND (3) TO DEVELOP A PROTOCOL FOR LONG-TERM EVALUATION IN SHEEP OF A FUNCTIONING PAD TRANSFERRING POWER TO AN IMPLANTED HEART ASSIST DEVICE. THE LONG-RANGE GOAL IS TO QUALIFY A PAD AND MAKE IT COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE FOR CLINICAL USE IN CONJUNCTION WITH A SYSTEM FOR TREATMENT OF PATIENTS IN SEVERE, CHRONIC LEFT HEART FAILURE. IN ADDITION, AVAILABILITY OF THE PAD FOR SHEEP WILL FACILITATE ITS FOR PRECLINICAL EVALUATION OF VARIOUS MECHANICAL HEART ASSIST SYSTEMS BY OTHERS. THIS PROGRAM WILL ALSO LEAD TO IMPROVED PADS FOR OTHER COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS SUCH AS VASCULAR ACCESS FOR KIDNEY DIALYSIS AND SKELETAL ATTACHMENT OF PROSTHETIC LIMBS.",

CURRENTLY CELL MARKER ANALYSIS, PROVEN TO BE CLINICALLY IMPORTANT IN THE DETECTION, DIAGNOSIS AND MONITORING OF HUMAN DISEASES, ARE PERFORMED EITHER MANUALLY VIA FLUORESCENT/LIGHT MICROSCOPY (IMPRECISE IDENTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL COUNTING ERRORS) OR BY FLOW CYTOMETRIC ANALYSIS (COSTLY CAPITAL EQUIPMENT OUTLAY). THE COMMERCIAL AVAILABILITY OF EASILY VISUALIZED, NONFLUORESCENT MONOCLONAL REAGENTS WILL PERMIT CLINICAL HOSPITAL LABORATORIES TO PERFORM CELL MARKER STUDIES ON ALREADY EXISTENT CAPITAL EQUIPMENT, IMAGE ANALYSIS SYSTEMS, WHICH PERFORM ROUTINE BLOOD CELL DIFFERENTIALS IN MANY LABS. THESE IMAGE ANALYSIS SYSTEMS ARE NOT CAPABLE OF FLUORESCENCE DETECTION WHICH NEGATES THEIR UTILIZATION WITH EXISTENT FLUORESCENT MONOCLONALS. ONE ASPECT OF THIS PROJECT WILL INVOLVE THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH NONFLUORESCENT HEAVY METAL COLLOID TAGS WHICH BECAUSE OF THEIR VARIABLE SIZE AND COLOR DIFFERENCES MAY BE USED IN COMBINATION RESULTING IN SAVINGS TO THE CUSTOMER. THESE WILL BE COUPLED TO A VARIETY OF COMMONLY USED AND SPECIALIZED MONOCLONAL REAGENTS AGAINST HUMAN LEUKOCYTES. THIS TECHNIQUE WILL PERMIT DIRECT VISUALIZATION OF THE CELLULAR ELEMENTS SPREAD IN A MONOLAYER OR THIN SECTION MANNER ON STANDARD MICROSCOPIC SLIDES. THIS WILL PERMIT INSTANT CYTOMORPHOLOGIC CORRELATION WITH THE CELL IN QUESTION. ALL NEW REAGENTS DEVELOPED WILL BE EVALUATED BY MANUAL AND FLOW CYTOMETRIC METHODOLOGIES IN A DOUBLE BIND TEST. ONCE DEVELOPED THE REAGENTS WILL BE MARKETED FOR CELL MARKER ANALYSIS USING DIRECT VISUAL ASSESSMENT (MANUAL AND/OR IMAGE ANALYSIS SYSTEMS) AS REAGENTS OR IN KIT FORM FOR USE IN THE ROUTINE CLINICAL LABORATORY. A SECOND ASPECT OF THIS PROPOSAL WILL ATTEMPT TO DEVELOP AND CHARACTERIZE SELECTED MURINE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES TO HUMAN TUMOR SPECIFIC ANTIGENS. ALL RESULTANT MONOCLONALS WILL BE CAREFULLY SCREENED AND CORRELATED WITH HISTOPATHOLOGIC INTERPRETATIONS. THE RESULTANT MONOCLONALS WILL BE TAGGED WITH THE NEW COLLOIDS AND WITH TRADITIONAL FLUORESCENT DYES FOR USE IN MANUAL, FLOW AND IMAGE CYTOMETRIC SYSTEMS. THESE STUDIES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE THE LEVEL OF TESTING SENSITIVITY FOR CELL MARKER ANALYSIS BY MANUAL METHODOLOGIES THROUGH THE ELIMINATION OF PROBLEMS RELATED TO HUMAN (EYE) DETECTION OF FLUORESCENCE INTENSITY AS THE COLLOIDS ARE ASSESSED BY LIGHT TECHNIQUES, AND WILL AFFORD UTILIZATION OF ALREADY EXISTENT CLINICAL LAB EQUIPMENT.",

IN PHASE I, THE FEASIBILITY OF USING PLATELET ENZYMES AS SUCH MARKERS WILL BE ASSESSED. OUR PRELIMINARY STUDIES HAVE INDICATED THAT CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF PLATELET MONOAMINE OXIDASE (MAO) ACTIVITY (I.E., SENSITIVITY TO INHIBITION BY ETHANOL) AND ADENYLATE CYCLASE (AC) ACTIVITY ARE ALTERED IN ALCOHOLICS AS COMPARED TO CONTROLS. IN THE PROPOSED STUDIES, WE WILL CONFIRM THE DIFFERENCES IN A LARGER POPULATION AND DEVELOP RELIABLE METHODS FOR PLATELET PREPARATION AND ENZYME ASSAY WHICH WILL ACCENTUATE THESE DIFFERENCES. WE WILL ALSO EXAMINE ENZYME ACTIVITIES IN PLATELETS OBTAINED FROM ALCOHOLICS WHO HAVE ABSTAINED FROM ALCOHOL FOR VARIOUS LENGTHS OF TIME, IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER OBSERVED CHANGES IN PLATELET ENZYME ACTIVITIES RESULT FROM EXPOSURE TO ETHANOL, OR ARE INDICATIVE OF GENETICALLY-DETERMINED DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ALCOHOLICS AND CONTROL SUBJECTS. IN PHASE II, OUR CHOSEN ASSAY METHODS FOR MAO AND AC ACTIVITY WILL BE STREAMLINED FOR CLINICAL USE. THE REVERSIBILITY OF ENZYME CHANGES WILL BE FURTHER ASSESSED, AND ENZYME ACTIVITIES IN OTHER PSYCHIATRIC POPULATIONS (E.G., SCHIZOPHRENICS, OR PATIENTS WITH AFFECTIVE DISORDERS), AS WELL AS IN FEMALE ALCOHOLICS, WILL BE EXAMINED TO DETERMINE THE SPECIFICITY OF THESE TESTS FOR ALCOHOLISM OR ALCOHOL ABUSE. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SIMPLE AND RELIABLE TESTS FOR DIAGNOSING PAST ALCOHOL ABUSE OR A PREDISPOSITION TO ABUSE ALCOHOL WILL PROVIDE FOR THE PHYSICIAN: 1) A MEANS OF ASCERTAINING AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO MAJOR PATHOLOGIC CONDITIONS; 2) A MEANS OF ASSESSING PATIENT COMPLIANCE WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO TERMINATE ALCOHOL INTAKE; AND, 3) A POSSIBLE MEANS OF IDENTIFYING INDIVIDUALS AT RISK FOR DEVELOPING PROBLEMS WITH ALCOHOL IN THE FUTURE.

        "abstract": "Abstract         METALLIC GLASSES FILL A MATERIALS GAP BETWEEN NICKEL-IRON SOFT MAGNETIC ALLOYS (THE PERMALLOYS) AND SOFT FERRITES. THEY SHOW HIGH RESISTIVITY AND COMPARABLE OR GREATER MAGNETIZATION RELATIVE TO THE FORMER AND LOWER RESISTIVITY BUT AT LEAST TWICE THE SATURATION INDUCTION OF THE LATTER. IN PARTICULAR, METALLIC GLASSES SHOW OUTSTANDING PROMISE AS A LOW LOSS, HIGH-MAGNETIC-INDUCTION CORE MATERIALS FOR THE GROWING HIGH-FREQUENCY, HIGH-POWER APPLICATIONS MARKETS. HOWEVER, PROBLEMS EXIST WITH LOSS RESONANCES IN TOROIDS OF CERTAIN GLASSY ALLOYS. WHILE THE LOSSES ARE KNOWN TO ORIGINATE FROM MAGNETOELASTIC INTERACTIONS, THE EXACT MODE OF COUPLING IS NOT DESCRIBED IN THE LITERATURE. WE HAVE A MODEL OF THE COUPLING WHICH, IF PROVEN TO BE CORRECT, SHOULD AID IN DESIGNING TRANSFORMER CORES OF LOWER LOSS. MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE PROPOSE A SIMPLE SERIES OF MEASUREMENTS WHICH SHOULD INDICATE WHETHER THE BETTER WAY WAY TO AVOID THESE LOSSES IS THROUGH USE OF A NON-MAGNETOSTRICTIVE, COBALT-BASE GLASS (WHICH NECESSARILY HAS LOWER SATURATION INDUCTION THAN IRON-BASE GLASSY ALLOYS) OR THROUGH MORE CAREFUL HEAT TREATMENT OF THE HIGHER INDUCTION BUT MAGNETOSTRICTIVE IRON-BASE AMORPHOUS ALLOYS. SPECIFICALLY, WE PROPOSE TO FABRICATE AMORPHOUS ALLOYS OF LOW MAGNETOELASTIC COUPLING AND TO COMPARE THEIR PERFORMANCE WITH THAT OF COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE MAGNETOSTRICTIVE AMORPHOUS COMPOSITIONS. THE COMPARISON IS EXPECTED 1) TO CONFIRM THE WIDELY ACCEPTED BELIEF THAT THE LOSSES ARE PRESENT ONLY IN MAGNETOSTRICTIVE COMPOSITIONS, 2) TO SUPPORT OUR MODEL IN WHICH THE LOSSES ARE A FUNCTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM DOMAIN CONFIGURATION, AND 3) TO GIVE A FIRST INDICATION OF WHETHER IT IS BETTER TO USE A NON-MAGNETOSTRICTIVE GLASSY ALLOY OR TO TRY TO HEAT TREAT THE MAGNEOSTRICTIVE GLASSY ALLOY IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE MAGNETOELASTIC LOSSES ARE MINIMIZED.",

THE INPUT SIGNAL WILL BE AMPLIFIED IN INDIVIDUAL 1/3 OCTAVE FREQUENCY BANDS. AMPLIFICATION WILL BE LIMITED TO A SUBJECT'S LOUDNESS DISCOMFORT LEVEL AS DETERMINED BY SEPARATE TESTING FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL. 3. AMPLIFICATION WILL BE DONE SELECTIVELY BASED ON THE BEHAVIOR OF THE INPUT SIGNAL. AMPLIFICATION ACTIVICATION CAN BE BASED ON A COMBINATION OF ABSOLUTE LEVEL, CHANGE IN LEVEL, AVERAGE CHANGE IN LEVEL OVER A GIVEN TIME PERIOD, THE NUMBER OF ZERO CROSSINGS OVER A GIVEN TIME PERIOD OR OTHER TIME DOMAIN FUNCTIONS. THE MOST APPROPRIATE AMPLIFICATION ACTIVATION FUNCTION WILL BE DETERMINED THROUGH TESTING. THE GOAL OF THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF THE PROJECT WILL BE TO BREAD-BOARD A WORKING MODEL OF THE PROCESSOR USING AVAILABLE OFF THE SHELF COMPONENTS. THIS WILL RESULT IN A CIGAR BOX SIZED PROCESSOR WHICH CAN BE CONNECTED TO AN EXISTING EAR MOLD TRANSDUCER FOR TESTING. THE INITIAL PERFORMANCE WILL BE MEASURED USING A KEMAR MANNEQUIN.

MONITORING WOULD BE APPLICABLE TO PATIENTS RANGING IN SIZE FROM NEWBORN TO ADULT AND FOR ACTIVITIES RANGING FROM SLEEP TO EXERCISE. THE UNIQUENESS OF THE METHODOLOGY LIES IN 1) THE USE OF THE LUNG AS A NONINVASIVE PORT FROM WHICH ALL SIGNIFICANT GAS EXCHANGE RELATED INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE BY ANALYSIS OF TRACER GAS COMPONENTS, AND 2) THE SIMULTANEOUS MEASUREMENT AND ANALYSIS OF A SUFFICIENTLY LARGE AND INDEPENDENT SET OF TRACER COMPONENTS TO PROVIDE CHARACTERIZATION OF ALL ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF THE COMPLEX GAS EXCHANGE PROCESS. THE METHODOLOGY HAS BEEN DEVELOPED UNDER NIH SPONSORSHIP. THE TECHNOLOGIES REQUIRED TO SUPPORT THE METHODOLOGY ARE 1) HIGH POWERED COMPUTER TECHOLOGY WITH EFFICIENT SOFTWARE, AND 2) MASS SPECTROSCOPY WHICH HAS A COMBINATION OF SENSITIVITY, FREQUENCY RESPONSE, DYNAMIC RANGE, AND ACCURACY, NOT YET FOUND IN PRACTICAL INSTRUMENTS. THE NECESSARY COMPUTING POWER IS NOW AVAILABLE AT A PRACTICAL COST. ALSO, BECAUSE OF RECENT ADVANCES IN MASS SPECTROMETER TECHNOLOGY, THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MASS SPECTROMETER WHICH HAS THE TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS, OPERATIONAL PRACTICALITY AND SULFICIENTLY LOW COST TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PRACTICAL MONITOR APPEARS FEASIBLE.

TO REDUCE THE MORBIDITY AND CURRENT EXPENSE OF DISC SURGERY AND THE DANGERS INHERENT IN CHEMONUCLEOLYSIS, AN AUTOMATED PERCUTANEOUS DISCECTOMY INSTRUMENT IS GREATLY NEEDED. THE PHASE I OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH PROJECT IS TO INVESTIGATE THE TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING AN AUTOMATED SUCTION AND CUTTING INSTRUMENT FOR PERCUTANEOUS REMOVAL OF HERNIATED DISC MATERIAL.* SHEATHED IN A BLUNT-END TUBE (2MM DIAMETER, 200MM LENGTH), THIS AUTOMATED ASPIRATING-CUTTING PROBE WOULD BE DRIVEN BY PNEUMATIC FORCE TO ENSURE AGAINST BINDING OR STALLING. COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) WOULD ACCOMPANY THE DEVELOPMENTAL USE OF THIS INSTRUMENT TO PROMOTE ACCURACY OF PROBE PLACEMENT AND TO SUBSTANTIATE OPERATIVE SUCCESS. PERCUTANEOUS NUCLECTOMY HAS NOW BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IN ABOUT 90 PATIENTS WORLDWIDE USING MANUAL INSTRUMENTS (2-4).

CURRENT METHODS SUCH AS MEASUREMENTS OF POCKET DEPTH, ATTACHMENT LEVEL, AND EVIDENCE OF BLEEDING ON PROBING, ARE UNRELIABLE AND ARE NOT CORRELATED STRONGLY WITH DISEASE ACTIVITY. AN URGENT RESEARCH NEED IS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE ACCURATE AND RELIABLE METHODS OF ASSESSING PERIODONTAL DISEASE ACTIVITY. A NON-INVASIVE METHOD WHICH CAN BE USED TO TEST THE EFFICACY OF EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENTS IN RELATIVELY SHORT TIME INTERVALS IS HIGHLY DESIRABLE. THE EXPECTED RESULTS OF THE PHASE I EFFORT WILL BE TO CONSTRUCT A PROTOTYPE NONINVASIVE PROBE AND TO OBTAIN PRELIMINARY DATA REGARDING EASE OF USE, SENSITIVITY, AND PRELIMINARY NUMERICAL DATA ON AN ANIMAL MODEL. THE PROBE WILL BE TESTED BY A DENTAL RESEARCHER WHO WILL ASSIST IN THE EVALUATION AND PROVIDE SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE PHASE II EFFORT. THE POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION IS THAT THE PROBE COULD BE USED BY DENTAL RESEARCHERS AND LATER BY CLINICIANS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY WHEN THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN LASER DOPPLER PROBE MEASUREMENTS AND PERIODONTAL DISEASE ACTIVITY HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED.",

DNA HYBRIDIZATION HAS PROVEN HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AS A RESEARCH DIAGNOSTIC TOOL; HOWEVER, CONVENTIONAL DNA HYBRIDIZATION PROBES ARE EXPENSIVE TO COMMERCIALIZE, SINCE THEY DEPEND ON ENZYMATICALLY MODIFIED CLONED DNA. SYNTHETIC DNAS COMPLEMENTARY TO KNOWN SEQUENCES ARE RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE TO PRODUCE. THESE PROBES HYBRIDIZE RAPIDLY TO SPECIFIC SEQUENCES IN DNA OR RNA AND ARE MORE SENSITIVE TO MUTATIONS AND STRAIN DIFFERENCES THAN CLONED PROBES. OUR GOAL IS TO DEVELOP AN OLIGONUCLEOTIDE-BASED TEST TO DETECT HEPATITIS B VIRUS B VIRUS (HBV), THE INTEGRATED FORM OF WHICH IS ASSOCIATED WITH HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA. PHASE I INVOLVES THE SYNTHESIS AND TESTING OF NORMAL AND MODIFIED-OLIGONUCLEOTIDES COMPLEMENTARY TO EITHER THE HBV SURFACE ANTIGEN OR CORE ANTIGEN GENES. PHASE I WILL COMPARE THE SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY OF OLIGOMER AND CLONED PROBES FOR FILTER-BOUND HBV SEQUENCES. PHASE II WILL REFINE THE USE OF ISOTOPIC AND NON-ISOTOPIC PROBES TO DETECT HBV IN CLINICAL SAMPLES IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS AT RISK FOR CANCER. ONCE SUCH PROBES ARE FULLY TESTED CLINICAL DIAGNOSTIC PROBES FOR OTHER SEQUENCES CAN BE DEVELOPED (E.G. HERPES VIRUS, EPSTEIN-BARR VIRUS, AND VIRAL ONCOGENES).",

MOST CASES HAVE INVOLVED HOMOSEXUAL OR BISEXUAL MEN; THE REMAINDER INVOLVED HETEROSEXUAL MEN AND WOMEN, HAITIANS, AND INTRAVENOUS DRUG ABUSERS. THE ETIOLOGY OF THE DISEASE IS PROBABLY A VARIOUSLY TRANSMITTED BIOLOGICAL AGENT. PATIENTS WITH AIDS HAVE EVIDENCE OF CELLULAR IMMUNODEFICIENCY WITH CUTANEOUS ENERGY, REDUCED NUMBERS AND ALTERED PROPORTIONS OF T-LYMPHOCYTES, AND IMPAIRED LYMPHOCYTE TRANSFORMATION. OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS AND KAPOSI'S SARCOMA OCCURRING IN THESE PATIENTS ARE LIKELY DUE TO ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY ANALOGOUS TO TREATMENT WITH IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE DRUGS. A GENETIC DEFICIENCY OF ADENOSINE DEAMINASE (ADA) HAS BEEN CAUSALLY ASSOCIATED WITH SEVERE COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCY DISEASE (SCIDS). PATIENTS WITH ADA DEFICIENCY ARE SUBJECT TO RECURRING, CHRONIC VARIED INFECTIONS TO WHICH THEY OFTEN SUCCUMB. MANY HAVE NO DETECTABLE LYMPHOCYTES IN PERIPHERAL BLOOD OR BONE MARROW. CELL MEDIATED IMMUNITY IS SEVERELY IMPAIRED. T-CELLS DEFINED BY E ROSETTES ARE OFTEN ABSENT AND LYMPHOCYTE PROLIFERATIVE RESPONSES ARE SEVERELY LIMITED. GIVEN THE CLOSE CLINICAL RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN AIDS AND SCIDS, WE PROPOSE TO MEASURE ADA LEVELS IN ERYTHROCYTES OF 20 TO 30 AIDS PATIENTS IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER A CLINICAL MANIFESTATION OF THE DISEASE PROCESS IS ASSOCIATED WITH A DEFICIENCY OF ADA. WE PROPOSE, DURING PHASE I, TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS AN ADA DEFICIENCY IN CIRCULATING ERYTHROCYTES OF AIDS PATIENTS.

THIS IMMUNITY IS PROVIDED BY SURROUNDING THE ACTUAL PRESSURE CELL WITH OIL AND SEGREGATING IT FROM THE PRESSURE MEDIA BY A DIAPHRAGM. THE DESIGN OF THE SENSOR AND ITS ELECTRONICS ALLOW ACCURATE MEASUREMENT OF PRESSURE BY MEASURING SMALL CHANGES IN SENSOR CAPACITANCE. THESE CHANGES REQUIRE LITTLE PHYSICAL DEFLECTION OF THE MEASUREMENT CELL, RESULTING IN MINIMAL EFFECTS FROM THE DIAPHRAGM AND THE HYSTERESIS OF THE CELL MATERIAL. ACCURATE CAPACITANCE MEASUREMENTIS ACHIEVED BY THE USE OF THE GUARDED ELECTRODE TECHNIQUE, COUPLED WITH NEIL BROWN INSTRUMENT SYSTEMS, INC. PROPRIETARY AC RATIOMETRIC ANALOG-TO-DIGITAL CONVERSION TECHNIQUES. TOGETHER THESE ESSENTIALLY ELIMINATE THE EFFECTS OF STRAY CIRCUIT CAPACITANCE USUALLY FOUND IN OTHER CAPACITANCE PRESSURE SENSORS. THE EFFORT OF THIS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IS IN DESIGNING TRANS DUCERS WITH PROPER PHYSICAL AND ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS; DETERMINING FABRICATION TECHNIQUES TO REPEATEDLY PRODUCE TRANSDUCERS THAT MEET THE DESIGN, AND TO CHARACTERIZE THE TRANSDUCERS PHYSICAL, ELECTRICAL AND THERMAL PROPERTIES.

THUS NUMERICAL SOLUTIONS BASED ON THE NONLINEAR SCHEMES AVOID THE SPURIOUS OSCILLATIONS AT SHOCK WAVES. FOR LINEAR SCHEMES SUCH AS MACCORMACK'S SCHEME, ARTIFICIAL DISSIPATION IS REQUIRED FOR STABILITY AND TO DAMP OUT THE SPURIOUS OSCILLATIONS. WHILE NONLINEAR SCHEMES ARE SUPERIOR TO LINEAR SCHEMES, THEY ARE ALSO MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE TO EXECUTE ON A COMPUTER. TYPICALLY, A NONLINEAR SCHEME REQUIRES ABOUT AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE MORE COMPUTER TIME THAN A LINEAR SCHEME. IT IS THIS INCREASED COST THAT HAS PREVENTED THE DEVELOPMENT AND UTILIZATION OF BETTER NONLINEAR SCHEMES. THIS PROJECT CONCERNS A PROGRAM TO DEVELOP A PROCEDURE WHEREBY THE EXECUTION OF A NONLINEAR SCHEME CAN BE MADE JUST AS RAPIDLY AND EFFICIENTLY AS FOR A LINEAR SCHEME.",

ACCORDINGLY, ITS POSSIBLE DIAGNOSTIC AND TREATMENT APPLICATIONS IN CERTAIN REFRACTORY ANEMIAS HAS BEEN POSTULATED. THE LACK OF BOTH RAW MATERIAL FOR ERYTHROPOIETIN PURIFICATION AND RELATIVELY PURE EP (>150 UNITS/MG PROTEIN) HAS SEVERELY COMPROMISED ITS USE IN RESEARCH, DIAGNOSIS, AND TREATMENT. FURTHERMORE, THIS SITUATION HAS BEEN COMPLICATED BY THE LACK OF AN ACCURATE, SIMPLE ASSAY FOR BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE EP. ACCORDINGLY, THE LONG TERM OBJECTIVES OF THIS INVESTIGATION ARE THE DEVELOPMENT OF ECONOMICAL PROCEDURES FOR THE GENERATION, ASSAY AND PURIFICATION OF ERYTHROPOIETIN. THROUGH THE USE OF SHEEP ALONG WITH A NOVEL BLEED-PLASMAPHERESIS PROCEDURE, IT IS BELIEVED THAT LARGE VOLUMES OF EP-RICH PLASMA (2-10 UNITS/ML) CAN BE ECONOMICALLY PRODUCED. THIS APPROACH WILL ALLOW FOR A LOW COST SUPPLY OF PLASMA FOR EP ASSAY AND PURIFICATION. THE IN VITRO PLASMA CLOT TECHNIC FOR CULTURING ERYTHROID PROGENITORS WILL BE REFINED AND DEVELOPED AS AN ERYTHROPOIETIN BIOASSAY. PURIFICATION WILL INITIALLY RELY ON A SIMPLIFIED PARTIAL PURIFICATION PROCEDURE BASED ON NITROCELLULOSE-EP BINDING AFFINITY AND STANDARD PURIFICATION PROCEDURES TO YIELD A PURE ENOUGH EP ANTIGEN TO GENERATE HIGHLY SPECIFIC EP-ANTISERA (POLYCLONAL AND/OR MONOCLONAL) WHICH COULD IN TURN BE USED TO EFFICIENTLY PURIFY ERYTHROPOIETIN.",

THIS TECHNIQUE OVERCOMES MANY OF THE DISADVANTAGES OF CURRENT METHODS AND PROVIDES THE FOLLOWING MAJOR FEATURES. CONTINUOUS MEASUREMENT OF BLOOD FLOW, ACCURACY ( 1%), SMALL SIZE (CAN BE MADE AS SMALL AS .3 MM DIAMETER), RELIABLE AND SAFE (NON-THROMBOGENIC), AND DIRECT MEASUREMENT AND DISPLAY OF FLOW PULSE SHAPE (FLOW VS. TIME). THE SPECIFIC AIM OF THIS PHASE I PROPOSAL IS TO BUILD A PROTOTYPE OF THE FLOW CATHETER AND TO VALIDATE ITS PREDICTED PERFORMANCE UNDER LABORATORY CONDITIONS. THE COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS FOR THE OPTECH DISPOSABLE CATHETER IS VERY PROMISING. WITH MORE THAN ONE MILLION CARDIOVASCULAR PROCEDURES DONE ANNUALLY AND WITH MORE THAN 300,000 BY-PASS SURGERIES DONE ANNUALLY, THE CONTINUOUS AND ACCURATE MEASUREMENT FEATURES OF THE OPTECH CATHETER WILL FIND USE IN DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES, CRITICAL CARE MONITORING, DURING ANGIOPLASTIC PROCEDURES, AND FOR CONTINUOUS CARDIAC OUTPUT MONITORING.

THE MOST COMMONLY USED TECHNIQUE, MID-PULSING, SUFFERS FROM VERY LOW DATA RATES ( < 1 HZ) AND QUESTIONABLE RELIABILITY IN POOR SIGNAL TO NOISE RATIO SCENARIOS. THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUE HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER DATA RATES AND THE ABILITY TO OPERATE IN SEVERE SIGNAL TO NOISE RATIO CONDITIONS WITH PROPER SIGNAL PROCESSING. THE TECHNIQUE DOES NOT SUFFER FROM THE TWO MOST COMMON PROBLEMS-UNRELIABILITY OR IMPRACTICALITY OR BOTH, WHICH HAVE PLAGUED ALL THE ALTERNATIVES TO MUD-PULSING WHICH HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED THUS FAR: I.E., EM TELEMETRY, ACOUSTIC COMMUNICATION THROUGH THE DRILL PIPE OR INSULATED CABLES. FURTHERMORE, THIS TECHNIQUE IS EASILY COMMERCIALIZABLE, AT LOW COST, BECAUSE IT DOES NOT REQUIRE MAJOR MODIFICATION TO EXISTING MUD-PULSING MWD SYSTEMS.

THE GFCS TECHNIQUE (4, 5, 6, 7) HAS BEEN DEVELOPED OVER THE PAST 15 YEARS AND HAS BEEN PRATICULARLY USEFUL IN THE MEASUREMENT OF ATMO SPHRIC POLLUTANTS. THE ESSENCE OF GFCS IS TO COMPARE THE TARGET RADIATION PASSING THROUGH A GAS FILTER CONTAINING THE GAS TO BE DETECTED WITH THE SAME RADIATION PASSING THROUGH A NEUTRAL FILTER. THE DIFFERENCE SIGNAL IS A MEASURE OF THE GAS CONCENTRATION IN THE OPTICAL PATH BEING EXAMINED. THE INFRARED IMAGER [8] HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO SPATIALY EXAMINE TARGETS AND SCENES IN THE INFRARED.

COMPUTER NETWORKS ARE BEING USED IN A RAPIDLY EXPANDING VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS RANGING FROM INTER-OFFICE COMMUNICATION TO DATA MANAGEMENT FOR THE SPACE STATION. SEVERAL DESIGN FACTORS DRIVE ALL NETWORK APPLICATIONS: THROUGHPUT, FAULT-TOLERANCE, EXPANDABILITY, AND SECURITY. ALL OF THESE FACTORS CAN BE ENHANCED BY EMPLOYING MULTI-BUS NETWORKS INSTEAD OF POINT-TO-POINT OR SINGLE-BUS NETWORKS. CURRENTLY, MULTI-BUS NETWORKS ARE DESIGNED IN AN AD HOC MANNER WHICH TYPICALLY COMBINES \"GOOD ENGINEERING SENSE\" WITH EXTENSIVE COMPUTER SIMULATIONS. NETWORKS DESIGNED IN THIS MANNER ARE NOT OPTIMAL WITH RESPECT TO MINIMIZING COST, MAXIMIZING THROUGHPUT, OR OTHER DESIGN OBJECTIVES. CLEARLY, THE CURRENT DESIGN METHODS COULD BE IMPROVED. THIS PROPOSAL DISCUSSES MATHEMATICAL METHODS FOR DESIGNING OPTIMAL, MULTI-BUS NETWORKS THAT SATISFY A SET OF DESIGN OBJECTIVES INVOLVING THROUGHPUT, FAULT-TOLERANCE, EXPANDABILITY, AND SECURITY. THE CENTRAL PROBLEM IN SOLVING STANDARD FORMULATIONS OF THIS PROBLEM IS THAT THE NUMBER OF BUS-TO-NODE INTERCONNECTIONS IS STAGGERING. THE PROBLEM RAPIDLY BECOMES MORE DIFFICULT AS THE NUMBER OF NODES INCREASES. THIS PROPOSAL PRESENTS INNOVATIVE METHODS FOR SOLVING MULTI-BUS NETWORK DESIGN PROBLEMS, WITH EMPHASIS GIVEN TO PRACTICAL ARCHITECTURES.",

THE 2-FREQUENCY LASER HAS BE DEMONSTRATED TO HAVE EXCELLENT FREQUENCY STABILITY. ITS OUTPUT CONSISTS OF ORTHOGONALLY POLARIZED COL-LINEAR BEAMS WHICH DIFFER IN FREQUENCY BY A TYPICAL VALUE OF 250 KHZ. THIS PERMITS THE RAPID COMPARISON OF DIFFERENTIAL OPTICAL PATH DIFFERENCES, WHICH IN TURN MAKES POSSIBLE A SERVO SYSTEM WITH A BANDWIDTH (OR STIFFNESS) LIMITED ONLY BY THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THE CONTROL ELEMENTS. THE HIGH OPERATING FREQUENCY AND RADIANCE OF THE LASER BEAM COMBINE TO ALLOW CONTROL RESOLUTIONS AT THE FUNDAMENTAL SHOT-NOISE LIMIT, WITH A VIRTUALLY UNLIMITED CONTROL RANGE. THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUE IS APPLICABLE TO THE FREQUENCY STABILIZATION OF BOTH CONFOCAL AND PLANE-MIRROR FABRY-PEROT ETALONS, AND CAN ALSO BE USED TO VERY PRECISELY CONTROL THE PARALLELISM OF THE FLAT FABRY-PEROT MIRRORS. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE HIGH EFFICIENCY IN A PLANE-MIRROR FABRY-PEROT ETALON, IT IS SHOWN THAT DISSIPATIVE LOSSES MUST BE MINIMIZED, AND THAT THE MIRROR REFLECTANCE MUST BE VERY PRECISELY CONTROLLED.

ONCOLOGY) AND (C) FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF TISSUE MOVEMENT (E.G. ACTION OF THE JOINTS) IN REAL TIME. THE DEVICE BEING PROPOSED IS A MODIFIED VERSION OF THE MICROCHANNEL SPATIAL LIGHT MODULATOR (MSLM). THE MSLM EMPLOYS A MICROCHANNEL PLATE AND A HIGH-RESISTIVITY ELECTRO-OPTIC CRYSTAL. THE MCP CONVERTS X-RAY IMAGES INTO ELECTRON IMAGES AND DEPOSITS THE ELECTRON IMAGE ON THE CYRSTAL. THE RESULTING ELECTRIC FIELD IN THE CRYSTAL MODULATES THE REFRACTIVE INDEX OF THE CRYSTAL AND THEREBY ALTERS THE POLARIZATION OF THE READOUT OPTICAL BEAM. AN OPTICAL INTENSITY IMAGE IS RECOVERED BY THE USE OF A POLARIZING ANALYSER. IN THE PHASE I RESEARCH PROGRAM WE EXPECT TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF X-RAY IMAGE CONVERSION, AND TO CHARACTERIZE THE SPATIAL RESOLUTION, FRAMING SPEED, STORAGE CHARACTERISTICS, AND EXPOSURE SENSITIVITY OF THE DEVICE. THE PHASE II RESEARCH PLAN WILL BE CONCERNED WITH THE PROBLEMS OF SCALING THE ACTIVE AREA OF THE DEVICE UP TO ABOUT 6 INCHES IN DIAMETER.

THERE ARE SCATTERED REFERENCES FROM THE PUBLISHED LITERATURE SUGGESTING THESE IMPROVEMENTS. APPROXIMATELY 20 NEW TRIVALENT ANTIMONY COMPOUNDS WILL BE PREPARED. PRIMARILY THEY WILL BE DERIVATIVES OF CARBOXYLIC ACIDS, HYDROXY-CARBOXYLIC ACIDS AND CARBOHYDRATES. THESE NEW COMPOSITIONS WILL BE TESTED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA BY PROF. WILLIAM L. HANSON. BESIDES REDUCING TOXICITY, ANOTHER BADLY NEEDED IMPROVEMENT IN THE THERAPEUTIC ADMINISTRATION OF ANTIPARASITIC DRUGS WOULD BE TO HAVE THE DRUGS TAKEN ORALLY RATHER THAN BY INCONVENIENT AND PAINFUL SUBCUTANEROUS OR INTRAMUSCULAR INJECTIONS. THE STRUCTURAL MODIFICATIONS OF THIS PROPOSAL SHOULD RESULT IN MORE STABLE AND BIOAVAILABLE ANTIMONY COMPOSITIONS ADMINISTERED BY ORAL INGESTION. THE AWARD, IF GRANTED, WOULD GIVE OUR NEW FLEDGLING FIRM CREDIBILITY.

ONE SUCH APPLICATION INVOLVES COOPER AND TUNGSTEN CONDUCTORS OF ELECTROMAGNETIC LAUNCH SYSTEMS COMMONLY KNOWN AS RAIL GUNS. THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES A NOVEL CONCEPT TO ENHANCE THE PERFORMANCE OF RAIL GUNS BY INCREASIG THEIR EFFICIENCY AND FIRING RATE. THE NOVEL CONCEPT INVOLVES MODIFYING THE DESIGN OF RAIL GUNS BY ADDITION OF MULTIPLE WIRES ATTCHED TO THE RAIL AND COOLED BY IMMERSION IN A CIRCULATING BATH OF LIQUID HYDROGEN. CRYOGENIC COOLING IS ESPECIALLY POWERFUL WITH THIS CONCEPT SINCE THE RE SISTIVE HEATING OF THE RAILS IS REDUCED AND THIS LEADS TO THE IMPROVED EFFICIENCY EXPECTED. IN ADDITION, THE CAPABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY TRANSFER THE ENERGY FROM ELECTRICAL HEATING OF THE RAILS TO THE COOLING SYSTEM LEADS TO THE RAPID MULTIPLE LAUNCH CAPABILITY. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS WORK ARE TO SHOW THAT THE ENERGY INPUT TO THE RAILS FROM THE ELECTRICAL CURRENT CAN BE TRANSFERRED TO THE CRYOGENIC COOLANT IN SHORT TIME PERIODS, AND BURNOUT OF COOPER WIRES ATTACHED TO THE RAILS WILL NOT OCCUR. THIS ANALYTICAL WORK WILL LEAD TO AN EARLY INDICATON OF THE FEASIBILITY OF THE NOVEL CONCEPT.",

IN PARTICULAR, POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS IN THE AREAS OF ONCOGENESIS, EARLY CANCER DIAGNOSIS, AND CANCER THERAPY WILL BE EXAMINED. THIS PROPOSAL IS DIRECTED TO THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE DIVISION OF CANCER BIOLOGY AND DIAGNOSIS. THE SYNCHROTRON LIGHT SOURCE WILL ALLOW IMAGING AND ANALYSIS OF TRACE METALS IN CELLS AT CONCENTRATION LEVELS FAR BELOW THOSE PREVIOUSLY VISUALIZABLE. IT IS EXPECTED THAT, USING AN X-RAY MICROPROBE BEAM LINE, TRACE METAL CONCENTRATIONS AT LEVELS OF INTEREST WILL BE MEASURABLE WITH SPATIAL RESOLUTIONS OF APPROXIMATELY ONE MICRON. THE EXTREME BRIGHTNESS (INTENSITY PER UNIT SOLID ANGLE) OF THE SYNCHROTRON LIGHT SOURCE ALLOWS EFFECTIVE TUNING OF THE ENERGY OF X-RAYS STRIKING THE SAMPLE. BY THIS SOURCE ENERGY SELECTION, ONE CAN MAXIMIZE FLUORESCENCE EFFICIENCIES FOR THE TRACE METALS OF INTEREST, WHILE MINIMIZING BACKGROUND INTERFERENCES. AMONG APPLICATIONS OF THE ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUE TO BE EXAMINED IN PHASE I ARE ONCOGENESIS ASSOCIATED WITH METAL TOXICITY, LYMPHOCYTE FERRITIN ANALYSIS IN THE EARLY DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST CANCER, AND PLATINUM AND OTHER METAL COMPLEXES AS USED IN CANCER THERAPY. PHASE I WILL DEFINE WHICH APPLICATION HAS GREATEST POTENTIAL AND WILL INCLUDE FEASIBILITY MEASUREMENTS ON SAMPLES OF INTEREST USING AN ELECTRON MICROPROBE FACILITY, WITH FOLLOW-UP PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS AT THE CORNELL SYNCHROTRON X-RAY FACILITY (CHESS).

THE CONCEPT EMPLOYS A THIN METAL FILM WHICH BECOMES LIQUID DURING IRRADIATION. THE FILM IS DESIGNED TO BE HIGHLY REFLECTING TO LASER IRRADIATION WITHOUT INTERFERING WITH THE VAPORIZATION THERMODYNAMICS OF THE HEAT SHIELD. THIS CONCEPT PROVIDES LASER HARDENING IN AN EXO ENVIRONMENT. AT ENDO ALTITUDES, THE THIN FILM WILL NOT INTERFERE WITH THE HEAT SHIELD FUNCTION. A COMBINED THEORETICAL-EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM IS PROPOSED. THE THEORETICAL EFFORT WILL DETERMINE THE RANGES OF LASER PARAMETERS FOR WHICH HIGH REFLECTIVITY WILL BE MAINTAINED AND IDENTIFY CADIDATE COATING MATERIALS. CANDIDATE MATERIALS WILL BE SCREENED FOR HIGH REFLECTIVITY, AND FOR STABLE LIQUID PHASE OVER REQUIRED TEMPERATURE RANGES. METAL ALLOYS WILL BE GIVEN PARTICULAR ATTENTION AS CANDIDATE MATERIALS. CONSIDERATION WILL BE GIVEN TO NUCLEAR HARDENING POTENTIAL. THE EXPERIMENTAL PORTION OF THIS PROGRAM WILL TEST CHOSEN CANDIDATE MATERIALS FOR HIGH REFLECTIVITY AND FILM STABILITY UNDER SIMULATED LASER INTERACTION. MEASUREMENTS WILL BE PERFORMED BYE-BEAM HEATING. FILM STABILITY, HEAT OF VAPORIZATION AND OPTICAL REFLECTIVITY WILL BE DETERMINED IN ORDER TO DETERMINE Q*.",

CURRENT HIGH-PRESSURE PLASMA SYSTEMS ETCH WITH A HIGH RATE BUT WITH POOR FEATURE CONFORMATION, WHILE REACTIVE ION ETCHERS ETCH ANISOTROPICALLY, BUT SLOWLY. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM USES A MAGNETRON CONFINEMENT GEOMETRY DISCOVERED BY THE PROPOSER SEVERAL YEARS AGO ON A GAS DIODE PROJECT WHERE IT WAS OBSERVED THAT SPUTTERING OF THE DIODE CATHODE WAS UNIFORM AND RAPID. WE PROPOSE TO APPLY THIS GEOMETRY TO ETCH VLSIC WITH ONE MICRON FEATURE SIZES IN THE SURFACE OF SEMICONDUCTOR WAFERS. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS APPARATUS WOULD BENEFIT THE CIRCUIT DESIGNERS, ENABLING FABRICATION OF HIGHER-DENSITY MEMORY CIRCUITS AND THE COMPETITIVE POSITION WORLD-WIDE OF THE NATION'S ELECTRONIC INDUSTRY WHOSE PRODUCTS ARE LIMITED BY THE RESOLUTION OF ETCH FEATURES IN CHIPS.",

A PLASMA POLYMER WHICH IS HIGHLY CROSSLINKED CAN BE DEPOSITED ON THE SURFACE OF SILICONE TO FORM A BARRIER TO TEAR FILM DEPOSITS AND TO MAKE THE SURFACE WETTABLE. BECAUSE THE PLASMA POLYMER IS THIN, OXYGEN PERMEABILITY WILL NOT BE APPRECIABLY AFFECTED. WHEN METHANE GAS IS POLYMERIZED AN HIGHLY CROSSLINKED POLYMER CAN BE PRODUCED. PHASE I STUDY HAS TWO GOALS. THE FIRST IS TO ESTABLISH THE CONDITIONS OF PLASMA POLYMERIZATION WHICH LEAD TO THE MOST CROSSLINKED METHANE POLYMER AND TO ESTABLISH A THICKNESS OF METHANE POLYMER THAT IS MOST DURABLE. THE SECOND IS TO IMPROVE THE PROCEDURE OF INCORPORATING HYDROPHILLIC GROUPS INTO THE STRUCTURE OF METHANE. IT IS EXPECTED THAT PHASE I OF THE STUDY WILL ESTABLISH A TECHNIQUE TO PRODUCE A PLASMA POLYMER 100-200 ANGSTROMS THICK THAT IS WETTABLE AND IMPERMEABLE TO TEAR FILM DEPOSITS.

BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTY OF OBTAINING SHALLOW HOMOJUNCTIONS WITH LOW SHEET RESISTANCE SURFACE LAYER IN MANY DIRECT GAP SEMICONDUCTORS, HETEROJUNCTION STRUCTURES ARE USED. THE HETEROJUNCTION PARTNER IS USUALLY A LARGE BAND GAP SEMICONDUCTOR WITH HIGH ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY (THE WINDOW MATERIAL), SUCH AS CADMIUM SULFIDE, INDIUM TIN OXIDE, ZINC OXIDE, ETC. HETEROJUNCTION THIN FILM SOLAR CELLS, SUCH AS CADMIUM SULFIDE/COPPER INDIUM SELENIDE AND CADMIUM SULFIDE/CADMIUM TELLURIDE, WITH AML EFFICIENCIES HIGHER THAN 10% HAVE BEEN OBTAINED. ALL WINDOW MATERIALS ARE OF N-TYPE CONDUCTIVITY DUE TO NON-STOICHIOMETRY (ANION VACANCIES ARE DONORS) OR THE INTRODUCTION OF DOPANTS, THUS LIMITING THE SOLAR CELLS TO THE N(+)-WINDOW MATERIAL/P-TYPE SEMICONDUCTOR CONFIGURATION. SINCE THE USE OF AN N-TYPE SEMI-CONDUCTOR FILM IS MORE DESIRABLE DUE TO ITS SURFACE STABILITY AND THE EASE OF CONTACT FORMATION, P-TYPE WINDOW MATERIALS MUST BE DEVELOPED. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP P-TYPE WINDOW MATERIALS FOR HETEROJUNCTION SOLAR CELLS BY PLASMA ENHANCED CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION TECHNIQUE.

THE LONG TERM OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A MICROCOMPUTER-CONTROLLED EXERCISE CYCLE. THIS TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE ROBOTIC DEVICE WILL AUTOMATICALLY ADJUST THE WORK LOAD TO MAINTAIN THE USER'S HEART RATE AT THE TARGET LEVEL. THE USER WILL SIT IN A SEMI-RECUMBENT POSITION AND GRASP ELECTRODES CONNECTED TO A CARDIOTACHOMETER CIRCUIT. AS THE USER PEDALS, THE HEART RATE WILL BE COMPARED TO THE TARGET RATE AND THE WORK LOAD AUTOMATICALLY ADJUSTED AS NEEDED. THE SPECIFIC AIMS DURING PHASE I ARE TO: 1) DEVELOP AN ENGINEERING PROTOTYPE, COMPLETE WITH ASSOCIATED SOFTWARE AND 2) DEVELOP THE RESEARCH PROTOCOLS NECESSARY TO TEST THE PROTOTYPE'S EFFICACY AS A SAFE AND EFFICIENT COMMERCIAL AEROBIC DEVICE SUITABLE EVEN FOR THOSE WHO MAY HAVE IMPAIRED CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTION, INCLUDING THE ELDERLY.

IN PARTICULAR, THE FIRST AIM OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT NET PROTEIN CATABOLISM (PCR) CAN BE CALCULATED FROM BUN AND SERUM CREATININE, THEREBY AVOIDING TECHNICAL PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH DAILY URINE COLLECTIONS. THE SECOND AIM IS TO DEVELOP COMPUTER SOFTWARE THAT WILL RELATE THE MEASURED CLINICAL AND METABOLIC RESPONSES OBSERVED IN PATIENTS AND VISUALLY DISPLAY THIS INFORMATION FOR THE PHYSICIAN PRESCRIBING NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT. THE THIRD AIM IS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT A DAILY REVIEW OF THE METABOLIC RESPONSE OF PATIENTS TO NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT WILL OPTIMIZE THE CONSUMPTION OF PARENERAL SOLUTIONS AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF PATIENT CARE. THESE GOALS WILL BE ACHIEVED BY MEASURING PROTEIN BALANCES (URINE COLLECTIONS, INTAKES, LOSSES, AND CHANGE IN BODY ACCUMULATION OF UREA) ON NUTRITIONALLY SUPPORTED PATIENTS TO VALIDATE PROTEIN BALANCE ESTIMATES. THESE ESTIMATES USE A SINGLE POOL MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF UREA NITROGEN AND BUN AND SERUM CREATININE TO CALCULATE RENAL CLEARANCE, RATES OF UREA PRODUCTION, AND PCR. THIS MODEL HAS BEEN VALIDATED IN RENAL PATIENTS. ALSO PROPOSED IS A USAGE ANALYSIS OF PARENTERAL SOLUTIONS AND PRESCRIPTION OF NUTRITIONAL ASSESSMENT BY DETERMINATION OF PHARMACY DISBURSMENTS AND REVIEW OF PATIENT CHARTS. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT GOOD CORRELATION BETWEEN ESTIMATED AND MEASURED PROTEIN BALANCES WILL RESULT AND THAT THESE DATA WHEN AVAILABLE TO THE PHYSICIAN WILL IMPROVE HIS NUTRITIONAL PRESCRIPTION WITH RESPECT TO THE PATIENT'S RESPONSE TO IT. THE RESULTS OF PHASE I WILL PROVIDE THE CRITERIA FOR DESIGNING COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE DURING PHASE II. THIS SOFTWARE WILL CALCULATE THE DAILY ASSESSMENT OF METABOLIC RESPONSE AND WILL BE DESIGNED FOR USE ON THE MICRO COMPUTERS CURRENTLY FOUND IN HOSPITAL INTENSIVE CARE WARDS.",

THE CONSTRUCTION IS BASED ON A TWO FOOT MODULE PERMITTING ANY BUILDING SIZE UP TO 8 FT. HIGH X 8 FT. WIDE X 20 FT. LONG. THE THEORY IS THIS ENTIRE UNIT INCLUDING ROOF AND FLOOR, CAN EASILY BE ASSEMBLED IN LESS THAN ONE HOUR BY TWO PEOPLE. FURTHERMORE, THE CONCEPT MAINTAINS LIGHTNESS IN WEIGHT BY USING HONEYCOMB LAMINATED PANELS, AND PACKAGED COMPLETELY FLAT WITHOUT WASTED AIR SPACE. THIS TECHNOLOGY OFFERS THE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO EASILY TRANSPORT AND ASSEMBLE SHELTERS IN REMOTE LOCATIONS FOR TEMPORARY HABITATION, GENERAL MATERIAL STORAGE, OR EQUIPMENT PROTECTION. PHASE I OF THIS PROGRAM CONSISTS OF COMPLETING THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND CONSTRUCTING A FUNCTIONAL PROTOTYPE. PHASE II WOULD INVOLVE FIELD TESTS AND EXPANDING APPLICATION FOR POSSIBLE COMMERCIAL USE.",

IN LIGHT OF DWINDLING SUPPLIES OF FOSSIL FUELS, BIOMASS WILL BE ACCORDED A GREATER ROLE IN SUPPLYING FUTURE ENERGY NEEDS. TO BEST MEET ANTICIPATED ENERGY NEEDS, THE MOST PRODUCTIVE PHOTOTROPHIC SYSTEMS MUST BE UTILIZED. MICROALGAE ARE THE MOST PRODUCTIVE PHOTOSYNETHETIC ORGANISMS ON EARTH, OFTEN PRODUCING FIVE TO TEN TIMES THE DRY MATTER PER AREA PER TIME AS THE MOST EFFICIENT VASCULAR PLANT COMMUNITIES AND FARMLANDS. WITHOUT EXPENDING ANABOLIC ENERGY FOR CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF SUPPORTIVE TISSUES, MICROALGAE OFTEN STORE AS MUCH AS 85% OF THEIR TOTAL BIOMASS AS EXCESS PHOTOSYNTHATE. IN SOME CASES OILY LIPIDS ARE STORED. AN OPPORTUNITY EXISTS TO UTILIZE LIPID-ACCUMULATING, OLEACEOUS MICROALGAE AS ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF LIQUID FUELS. TO DATE, VERY FEW SPECIES HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED FOR POTENTIAL UTILITY IN THIS REGARD. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD HELP TO FILL THIS GAP IN APPLIED MICROALGAL RESEARCH BY ISOLATING FROM SOIL NOVEL STRAINS OF MICROALGAE ABLE TO ACCUMULATE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF HYDROPHOBIC MATERIALS. SCREENING AND SELECTION PROCEDURES WILL INCLUDE ASSESSMENT OF MICROALGAL CHARACTERISTICS THAT INFLUENCE THE COMMERCIAL FEASIBILITY OF THEIR MASS CULTURE. LABORATORY GROWTH EXPERIMENTS WILL BE CONDUCTED IN ORDER TO DETERMINE MAXIMUM SPECIFIC GROWTH RATES AND TOTAL LIPID YIELDS OF MICROALGAE THAT ACCUMULATE GREATER THAN 25% OF THEIR BIOMASS AS LIPIDS IN RESPONSE TO NITROGEN DEPLETION. OTHER ASPECTS OF MASS CULTURE CRITICAL TO EVENTUAL COMMERCIALIZATION INCLUDE ABILITY OF SELECTED STRAINS TO EFFECTIVELY COMPETE WITH MICROALGAL WEED SPECIES, AND HARVESTABILITY. LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS WILL ADDRESS THE FIRST PROBLEM BY MEANS OF ONE-ON-ONE COMPETITIVE GROWTH TRIALS WITH A COMMON MASS CULTURE CONTAMINANT. THE LATTER PROBLEM WILL BE ASSESSED BY ESTIMATING REMOVAL EFFICIENCY FROM WATER AND CONCENTRATION FACTORS FOR SEDIMENTATION, CHEMICAL FLOCCULATION, AND MICROSTRAINING.

SPECIFICALLY, IT DEALS WITH THE DEVELOPMENT, INITIAL TESTING AND EVALUATION OF MEDICAL IMAGING SYSTEMS, SUBSYSTEMS AND INTRINSIC HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. THIS GRANT IS CONCERNED WITH TELERADIOLOGY WHICH IS THE TRANSMISSION OF X-RAY IMAGES FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER USING ORDINARY TELEPHONE LINES OR OTHER ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION MEDIA. ITS INTENDED USE IS TO SEND THESE X-RAY IMAGES FROM REMOTE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WHERE RADIOLOGISTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO CENTRALLY LOCATED FACILITIES WHERE THEY ARE AVAILABLE, SO TIMELY READING CAN BE OBTAINED. DIAGNOSTIC IMAGE ASSESSMENT IS A MAJOR RESEARCH COMPONENT BECAUSE TRANSMITTED IMAGES MUST BE SUFFICIENTLY FAITHFUL TO THE ORIGINAL RADIOGRAPH TO SUPPORT NORMAL RADIOLOGICAL PRACTICE AT REMOTE FACILITIES. HUMAN REACTION RESEARCH IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE A \"SYSTEM\" HAS HUMAN BEINGS AT BOTH ENDS. IF PROFESSIONAL ACCEPTANCE IS LACKING, THE \"SYSTEM\" WILL NOT WORK OF HOW WELL THE EQUIPMENT WORKS. THE ABILITY TO STORE IMAGES EFFICIENTLY AND ECONOMICALLY AND TO RETRIEVE THEM QUICKLY ENOUGH FOR PROFESSIONALS TO \"ACCEPT\" THE SYSTEM, AND TO USE IT, IS A CRITICAL FEATURE IN A SUCCESSFUL \"SYSTEM.\" EXAMINING THESE PROBLEMS, IT BECOMES CLEAR THERE ARE FIVE \"SYSTEM\" PARTS: THE COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK; THE ARCHIVING MEDIUM; THE DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEM; THE DISPLAY CONSOLE; AND, THE SOFTWARE (PACS). EXPECTED RESULTS OF THIS PHASE I GRANT PROPOSAL ARE TO ELUCIDATE A SYSTEMS APPROACH AND DEVELOP, TEST AND EVALUATE EQUIPMENT IN PHASE II TO IMPROVE THE DELIVERY OF HEALTH CARE IN MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS BY THE MEANS OF TELECOMMUNICATING DIGITAL RADIOLOGIC IMAGES.

SUCH APNEAS ARE THOUGHT TO PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME. ALTHOUGH A VARIETY OF MONITORS ARE AVAILABLE TO DETECT CENTRAL APNEAS, NONE ARE SUFFICIENTLY SIMPLE TO USE OR RELIABLE ENOUGH TO DETECT OBSTRUCTIVE APNEAS. RESPIRATORY MUSCLE EFFORTS DURING OBSTRUCTIVE APNEAS ARE BEST DETECTED BY CHANGES OF INTRAPLEURAL PRESSURE, BUT HERETOFOR THIS REQUIRED INSERTION OF AN ESOPHAGEAL BALLOON CATHETER WHICH IS TOO INVASIVE FOR LONG TERM MONITORING. INTRAPLEURAL PRESSURE SWINGS IN THE ABSENCE OF AIRFLOW AT THE NOSE AND MOUTH ESTABLISH THE DIAGNOSIS OF OBSTRUCTIVE APNEAS.

THE PROPOSAL FOR PHASE I IS TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE TO ACCOMPLISH SUCH A GOAL. FOR PHASE 2, IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT FIELD TRIALS WILL FURTHER REFINE THE METHODOLOGY. THE TECHNIQUES ARE BASED UPON TRANSDUCER KNOWLEDGE DEVELOPED BY RESPITRACE CORPORATION ALONG WITH AN IMPORTANT DISCOVERY ON THE RELATIONSHIP OF CRANIAL BONE MOVEMENTS TO THE RESPIRATORY CYCLE. MOVEMENTS OF CRANIAL BONES DETECTED BY SURFACE INDUCTIVE PLETHYSMOGRAPHY CLOSELY RESEMBLE INTRAPLEURAL PRESSURE SWINGS IN NEWBORN PUPPIES AND LAMBS.

REA FEELS THE BASIC CONCEPTS ARE WELL UNDERSTOOD FOR THIS DEVICE. THE MAIN THRUST OF THE INVESTIGATION WILL BE TO OPTIMIZE THE CRITICAL DESIGN FEATURES. REA PROPOSES TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF VARIOUS DESIGN CONCEPTS FOR A LIFTING DEVICE BY FOCUSING ON THE FOLLOWING PROJECT OBJECTIVES: - TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE DESIGN PROBLEM, IDENTIFY THE LIFTING REQUIREMENTS, AND CONSIDER CANISTER SPECIFICATIONS. - TO INVESTIGATE THE HOT CELL SYSTEM'S REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING THE SIZE RANGE AND MATERIAL QUALITIES OF THE CANISTERS, MANEUVERABILITY REQUIREMENTS, AND HOT CELL CHARACTERISTICS. - TO INVESTIGATE ALTERNATIVE DESIGN SOLUTIONS, AND CONSIDER METHODS OF USING GRIPPING FORCE, PRESSURE-FRICTION RATIOS FOR GRIPPERS, AND GRAPPLE ENHANCEMENTS. - TO PROPOSE DESIGN ALTERNATIVES WITH THE POTENTIAL TO MEET HANDLING REQUIREMENTS AND TO SELECT A DESIGN APPROACH. REA ANTICIPATES THAT ITS FEASIBILITY STUDY WILL LEAD TO A DESIGN WHICH WILL BE A MAJOR IMPROVEMENT OVER STATE-OF-THE-ART REMOTE HANDLING DEVICES FOR RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL. EVENTUALLY, THE DESIGN COULD BE MODIFIED TO PRODUCE DEVICES WHICH WOULD FACILITATE THE REMOTE HANDLING OF DRUMS, FUEL BUNDLES, PIPES, TUBES AND OTHER PACKAGES LACKING LIFTING FIXTURES.

MOST BIOMEDICAL WASTE GENERATORS DO LITTLE OR NO IN-HOUSE PROCESSING BEFORE SHIPPING WASTE TO A COMMERCIAL BURIAL GROUND. THE REASONS ARE FREQUENTLY BECAUSE OF ECONOMIC OR REGULATORY LIMITATIONS. CENTRALIZATION OF PROCESSING AND DISPOSAL FACILITIES TO SERVE A NUMBER OF GENERATORS REPRESENTS A UNIQUE APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM. SUCH A FACILITY WOULD USE A VARIETY OF STATE OF THE ART EQUIPMENT TO TREAT MANY RADWASTE FORMS. FEASIBILITY WILL BE STUDIED FROM MANY STANDPOINTS, INCLUDING WASTE STREAM ANALYSIS AND CHARACTERIZATION, FACILITY AND EQUIPMENT ENGINEERING AND DESIGN, ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND ANALYSIS, AND POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. THE INFORMATION ACCUMULATED DURING THIS STUDY WILL PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR PROCEEDING WITH DEVELOPMENT OF A FACILITY WHICH WILL REDUCE THE VOLUME AND TOTAL RADIOACTIVITY BEING SHIPPED TO COMMERCIAL BURIAL GROUNDS. THE COST TO BIOMEDICAL WASTE GENERATORS WILL BE REDUCED. ADDITIONALLY, THE THREAT OF CURTAILMENT OF VITAL BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH RESULTING FROM WASTE DISPOSAL PROBLEMS WILL BE LESSENED. THE FACILITY WILL SERVE AS A MODEL FOR SIMILAR PLANTS IN OTHER REGIONAL RADWASTE COMPACT AREAS.",

THIS PROPOSED CONCEPT PROVIDES FOR STABLE, TOTAL MAGNETIC CONTAINMENT AND EXPANSION OF THE IONIZED PROPELLANT. IT AVOIDS THE SPECIFIC IMPULSE LIMITATIONS DUE TO HEAT TRANSFER OF CONVENTIONAL PHYSCAL NOZZLE ELECTROTHERMAL THRUSTERS. IT OFFERS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN OPERATING LIFE AND EFFICIENCY OVER PRIOR PARTIALLY MAGNETIC CONTAINED EXTERNAL MAGNETIC FIELD MPD THRUSTERS WHICH A DECADE AGO DEMONSTRATED EFFICIENCIES OF 35% AT SPECIFIC IMPULSES OF 2000-3000 SEC. AND OPERATING LIVES OF 500-1000 HOURS. RESEARCH ON THOSE THRUSTERS WAS TERMIATED IN THE EARLY 1970'S BEACUSE OF A DECLINE IN INTEREST IN HIGH POWER ELECTRIC PROPULSION. RECENT REVIEWED INTEREST IN EARTHORBIT ELECTRIC PROPULSION FOR ORBIT RAISING, MANEUVERING, AND/OR DRAG CANCELLATION HAS STIMULATED A RENEWED INTEREST IN HIGH-PERFORMANCE 2000-3000 SECOND SPECIFIC IMPULSE THRUSTERS. THE PROPOSED THRUSTERS CONCEPT, WHICH INNOVATIVELY BUILDS ON THE BEST OF THE PAST TECHNOLOGY, COULD BE THE PRIME CANDIDATE TO MEET SUCH MISSION RE QUIREMENTS. IN PHASE I ALTERNATE APPROACHES FOR HEATING A COMPLETELY MAGNETICALLY CONTAINED ELECTRTHERMAL THRUSTERR WILL BE EVALUATED, A CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF THE MOST PROMISING TYPE THRUSTER WILL BE DEVELOPED ALONG WITH PERFORMANCE ESTMATES, AND IT'S POTENTIAL WILL BE COMPARED WITH ALTERNATIVE THRUSTERS.",

THE DESIGN IS BASED ON A VARIABLE RESIDENCE TIME (VRT) CONCEPT WHICH ALLOWS LARGE AND AGGLOMERATED FUEL PARTICLES ADEQUATE TIME TO COMPLETELY BURN. HIGH DURABILITY OF THE COMBUSTOR IS ACHIEVED BY DUAL FUNCTION USE OF THE INCOMING AIR. FOR APPLICATIONS WHICH REQUIRE THE BURNING OF COAL/OIL SLURRIES, THE DESIGN HAS THE CAPABILITY OF REMOVING THE ASH PARTICLES DIRECTLY FROM THE PRIMARY ZONE OF THE COMBUSTOR. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SIZE REQUIREMENT OF THIS COMBUSTOR DESIGN, EXISTING GAS TURBINE ENGINES COULD BE RETROFITTED WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE CURRENT ENGINE ENVELOPE. THE PRESENT PROPOSAL IS FOR EXPERIMENTAL AND ANALYTICAL PROGRAM TO DETERMINE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMBUSTOR DESIGN. THE SUPPORTS OF A MAJOR GAS TURBINE ENGINE MANUFACTURER AND A WORLD RENOWNED AUTHORITY ON COMBUSTION HAVE ALREADY BEEN OBTAINED FOR THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS REQUIRED FOR THIS PROGRAM.",

THE TECHNIQUE WOULD EMPLOY ATOMIC EMISSION DETECTION OF ARSENIC (AS), PHOSPHORUS (P), CHLORINE (CL), AND FLUORINE (F), WHICH ARE MAJOR COMPONENTS OF THESE AGENTS. THE SPARK METHOD IS WELL-ESTABLISHED, HAVING BEEN EMPLOYED BY SEVERAL WORKERS TO DETECT THESE SPECIES, AND ALSO BY OURSELVES FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF TRACE WATER VAPOR. DETECTABILITY OF THIS TECHNIQUE IS AT THE PPM TO SUB-PPM LEVEL, WITH A TIME RESPONSE OF A SECOND OR LESS. IN ADDITION, THE DEVICE WOULD BE RUGGED AND MODERATE IN COST, AND IT COULD ALSO BE READILY DESIGNED TO MEASURE ADDITIOAL ATOMIC SPECIES WHICH INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF OTHER AGENTS OR CONTAMINANTS. THE PHASE I OBJECTIV IS THE PROOF OF PRINCIPAL EXPERIEMENT TO DEMONSTRATE TRACE CHEMICAL AGENT DETECTION IN AIR USING NON-TOXIC SIMULANTS. IN PHASE II, A FLEXIBLE BRASSBOARD APPARATUS WOULD BE BUILT, MEASUEMENTS WOULD BE MADE WITH CHEIMICAL AGENT SIMULANTS, AND A PROTOTYPE DEVICE WILL BE DESIGNED.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE VELOCITY OF SOUND IN A FLUID IS INFLUENCED BY TEMPERATURE, DENSITY, AND FLUID VELOCITY. THE RECENTLY DEVELOPED TECHNIQUE OF ULTRASONIC TOMOGRAPHY CAN PROVIDE A TWO-DIMENSIONAL MEASUREMENT OF THE ULTRASONIC VECTOR VELOCITY DISTRIBUTION IN A PLANE DEFINED BY A RING OF TRANSDUCERS ENCLOSING THE FLOW. THE TIME-OF-FLIGHT (TOF) IN THE PLANE OF INTEREST IS MEASURED ALONG ALL POSSIBLE PATHS AND INVERTED BY A COMPUTER TO FORM THE VELOCITY MAP. BY PLACING A SECOND RING OF TRANSDUCERS DOWNSTREAM FROM THE FIRST RING, AND MEASURING THE TOF BETWEEN ALL TRANSDUCER PAIRS, IT IS POSSIBLE TO RECONSTRUCT THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL VECTOR VELOCITY FIELD IN A MOVING FLUID. FURTHERMORE, IT IS POSSIBLE TO SEPARATE THE INTRINSIC LOCAL PROPAGATION VELOCITY FROM THE VECTOR VELOCITY OF THE FLUID. SINCE THE LOCAL VELOCITY CAN BE RELATED TO FLUID DENSITY, IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO CALCULATE MASS FLOW ON A LOCAL AS WELL AS GLOBAL BASIS. INCLUSION OF CONSTRAINTS SUCH AS CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, MOMENTUM, MASS AND CONTINUITY PROVIDE MEANS FOR INCREASING THE ACCURACY OF SUCH RECONSTRUCTIONS. IF THE FLUID IS KNOWN TO BE HOMOGENEOUS, ANY VARIATION IN LOCAL SPEED OF SOUND MAY BE RELATED TO TEMPERATURE. IT IS, THEREFORE, POSSIBLE TO PROVIDE A COMPLETE THREE-DIMENSIONAL TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION IN ADDITION TO THE VECTOR VELOCITY OF THE FLUID.",

TWO APPROACHES WILL BE TAKEN USING BIOCIDAL AGENTS THAT ARE MADE NON-LEACHABLE BY CHEMICAL OR FREE RADICAL ATTACHMENT TO THE POST-TREATMENT BED: (1) QUATERNARY AMMONIUM MONOMER BIOCIDES ATTACHED TO CARBON OR ION EXCHANGE RESIN SURFACE VIA CHEMICAL REACTION OR BY FREE RADICAL GRAFTING USING CERIUM, OZONE, PEROXIDE, OR UV ACTIVATION AND (2) IN SITU BONDING OF ZINC PEROXIDE WITH CARBON BLACK AND/OR ION EXCHANGE RESIN FORMED BY REACTION OF ZINC ACETATE WITH HYDROGEN PEROXIDE IN SITU. FOR BED TREATMENTS, TEST METHODS FOR OBSERVING GROWTH OF BACTERIA ON AN ANION EXCHANGE OR ACTIVATED CARBON BED WILL INCLUDE EITHER ASTM G21(22) AND/OR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MORE RAPID TEST METHOD USING CIRCULATING RIVER WATER. MODIFIED ACTIVATED CARBON AND ION EXCHANGE BEDS WILL BE EXAMINED FOR POSSIBLE LOSS OF PURIFICATION PROPERTIES, AND THE EFFLUENT WILL BE ANALYZED BY MASS SPECTROMETRY FOR PRESENCE OF TOXIC PRODUCTS.",

IF SUCCESSFUL, THIS EFFORT WOULD RESULT IN THE AVAILABILITY OF THE MAJOR STATISTICAL METHODOLOGIES FOR CLINICAL TRIALS IN A FORM THAT IS POWERFUL AND EASY TO USE ON A WIDE VARIETY OF MINI-AND MICRO-COMPUTERS. EMPHASIZED IN THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT WILL BE: (A) USER-FRIENDLINESS, (B) THE FLEXIBILITY TO PERFORM ALL THE KEY ANALYSES USED IN THE ANALYSIS OF CLINICAL TRIALS AND OBSERVATIONAL PROSPECTIVE STUDIES, AND (C) PORTABILITY AMONG THE NEW GENERATION OF POWERFUL MINI- AND MICRO-COMPUTERS. WITH THESE OBJECTIVES, THIS SOFTWARE PACKAGE WOULD HAVE APPLICABILITY AND USE IN BOTH GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AND PRIVATELY-SPONSORED CLINICAL TRIALS AND OBSERVATIONAL PROSPECTIVE STUDIES. THIS PROPOSED EFFORT IS PERTINENT TO THOSE PROGRAMS WITHIN NIH WHICH USE CLINICAL TRIAL OR COHORT STUDY METHODOLOGY, AND WOULD INCLUDE PROGRAMS WITHIN THE DIVISION OF CANCER CAUSE AND PREVENTION (NCI), THE CLINICAL TREATMENT RESEARCH PROGRAM OF THE DIVISION OF CANCER TREATMENT (NCI), AND THE CANCER SCREENING AND PREVENTION PROGRAMS OF THE DIVISION OF RESOURCES, CENTERS, AND COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES (NCI), AND VARIOUS PROGRAMS WITHIN NHLBI. TO STREAMLINE THIS EFFORT, IT IS PROPOSED: (A) TO USE AS A STARTING POINT EXISTING PROGRAMS AND SUBROUTINES, MANY OF WHICH HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED BY THE PROPOSERS, AND (B) TO DESIGN THE SOFTWARE PACKAGE IN LOGICALLY SEPARATE MODULES (ANALYSIS MODULES, DATA MAINTENANCE MODULES, AND USER INTERFACE MODULES). A POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION OF THIS PROPOSED EFFORT IS THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE SOFTWARE PACKAGE, PERHAPS UNDER A CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENT WITH AN APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTOR OF SCIENTIFIC SOFTWARE. THE DEMAND FOR SUCH A PACKAGE IS EXPECTED TO BE HIGH BECAUSE OF: (A) THE INCREASING USE OF THE CLINICAL TRIAL AND FOLLOW-UP STUDY METHODOLOGY, NOTABLY IN CANCER RESEARCH AND IN HEART DISEASE RESEARCH, AND (B) THE PROLIFERATION OF A NEW GENERATION OF COMPUTERS THAT ARE BOTH POWERFUL AND INEXPENSIVE, THUS BRINGING COMPUTING WITHIN REACH OF A BROAD SPECTRUM OF USERS, INCLUDING CLINICIANS, BIOSTATISTICIANS AND TEACHERS.",

IF MICROWAVES ARE PROVEN TO CAUSE THE TRANSITION OF ELECTRONS IN ORGANOPHOSPHOROUS COMPOUNDS, CHEMICAL WARFARE AGENTS CAN BE IONIZED TO INCREASE THE AFFINITIES OF THESE COMPOUNDS FOR MILD DECONTAMINANTS COMPATIBLE WITH STATE OF THE ART ELECTRONICS. IONIZED CHEMICAL WARFARE AGENTS WILL REACT RAPIDLY AND COMPLETELY. LARGE VOLUMES OF CONTAMINATED AIR ENTERING A DEEP BASE THROUGH THE VENTILATING SYSTEM CAN BE PURIFIED WITH MICROWAVES AND MILD DECONTAMINANTS. PURIFIED AIR CAN BE USED TO PRESSURIZE INTERIOR MANNED SPACES IN ORDERTO CONTINUOUSLY FLUSH OUT CONTAMINANTS SEEPING INTO THE BASE THROUGH MINUTE OPENINGS. NEW DECONTAMINANTS AND THE TIMELINESS OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT, HOWEVER, ARE UNCERTAIN. MICROWAVE IONIZATION WILL IM PROVE RESPIRABLE AIR DECONTAMINATION PROCESSES AT MINIMAL COST WITH LITTLE RISK OF IMPLEMENTATION.",

SEPARATION OF EACH OLIGOMERIC MIXTURE WILL BE EVALUATED WITH RESPECT TO THREE DIFFERENT STATIONARY PHASES. EACH STATIONARY PHASE WILL BE INVESTIGATED AT A MINIMUM OF THREE ISOTHERMAL OPERATING TEMPERATURES, AT LEAST THREE DIFFERENT MOBILE PHASES AT NEAR OPTIMUM AVERAGE LINEAR VELOCITY AND UNDER VARIOUS LINEAR DENSITY PROGRAMMING CONDITIONS. THE EFFECT OF EACH OF THESE VARIABLES ON THE QUALITY OF THE OBSERVED SEPARATION WILL BE EVALUATED USING KAISER'S \"SEPARATION POWER\" EQUATION. THE SEPARATION OF EACH SAMPLE WILL BE OPTIMIZED WITH RESPECT TO THE ABOVE CONDITIONS, THEN, ONCE OPTIMIZED, THESE CONDITIONS WILL BE SYSTEMATICALLY VARIED SO THAT THE EFFECT ON RELATIVE RETENTION CAN BE CALCULATED. THE RESULTING INFORMATION WILL BE EVALUATED WITH RESPECT TO THEORETICALLY PREDICTED BEHAVIOR, AND WITH RESPECT TO THE PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF THE SOLUTES, STATIONARY PHASES AND MOBILE PHASES. ADDITIONALLY, THE EFFECT OF GRADIENT ELUTING MATERIALS (MODIFIERS) AND CONDITIONS WILL BE STUDIED. THIS RESEARCH WILL PROVIDE A USEFUL FOUNDATION IN WHICH TO EXTEND THE RESEARCH TO BIOPOLYMERS SUCH AS POLYPEPTIDES, POLYSACCHARIDES, TRIGLYCERIDES AND OLIGONUCLEOTIDES.",

HOWEVER, DEFIBRILLATORS ARE STILL BEING SOLD WEIGHING IN THE ORDER OF 20-40 LBS. MAKING THEIR APPLICATION IN THE EMERGENCY ENVIRONMENT DIFFICULT. IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION RECOVERY IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE SPEED OF APPLICATION OF THE DC COUNTERSHOCK (DEFIBRILLATION) AND THAT LOWER ENERGIES CAN BE USED. LOWER ENERGY CONVERSION HAS BEEN SHOWN TO GREATLY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF PATIENT LONG-TERM SURVIVAL. THERE IS CLEARLY A NEED FOR A POCKETTYPE DEFIBRILLATOR WHICH WOULD FULFILL THESE REQUIREMENTS: (1) SIMPLE TO OPERATE, (2) LONG BATTERY LIFE, (3) STURDY CONSTRUCTION, (4) SELF-TEST CAPABILITY, (5) LIGHTWEIGHT, (6) EXCHANGEABLE BATTERY PACK, (7) MINIATURE VOLTAGE SUPPLY. THE CRITICAL COMPONENTS IN THIS SYSTEM ARE THE BATTERY AND THE CAPACITOR. THE OTHER COMPONENTS CAN BE DEVELOPED THROUGH IMPROVEMENT OF EXISTING STATE-OF-THE-ART ITEMS. THE PRIMARY EMPHASIS, THEREFORE OF THE PHASE I EFFORT WILL BE TO DETERMINE THE TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING A MINIATURIZED CAPACITOR WEIGHING LESS THAN 1 LB.

TO PROVE THESE TWO POINTS, WE WILL ACCOMPLISH FOUR TASKS: (1) TO DEMONSTRATE THAT OUR AI APPROACHES ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THE EXISTING METHODOLOGIES FROM BOTH THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS; (2) TO IDENTIFY VERY DIFFICULT FEATURE CAPTURING PROBLEMS THAT HAVE TO BE OVERCOME BEFORE CONSIDERING RULE-BASED FEATURE IDENTIFICATION EFFORT; (3) TO DEMOSTRATE A COMBINED RADC/SR & E IMAGE EXPLOITATION CAPABILITY AND THUS PROVE THAT A NEARLY OPERATIONAL AI SYSTEM IS ALREADY AVAILABLE; AND (4) TO DEVELOP A STRATEGIC PLAN FOR DEVELOPING ADVANCED PROCESSORS FOR SOLVING VERY DIFFICULT PROBLEMS USING THE CONCEPT OF IMAGE HIERARCY.

CONTINUOUS (INFINITE GEAR RATIOS) MATCHING IS ACHIEVED BY A NOVEL DIRECT-DRIVE METHOD USING NO FLUIDS OR FRICTIONAL CLUTCHES FOR ENERGY COUPLING. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER ADVANTAGES WHICH CAN BE EXPLOITED FOR DEVELOPMENT OF MECHANICAL TOOLS.

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE COST OF DRILLING A GEOTHERMAL WELL IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE COST OF DRILLING AN OIL AND GAS WELL AT COMPARABLE DEPTHS. THE HIGHER COST IS DUE PRINCIPALLY TO TWOFACTORS: THE HARDNESS OF THE ROCK FORMATIONS BEING DRILLED AND THE HIGH TEMPERATURES ENCOUNTERED IN DRILLING. THESE TWO FACTORS REDUCE THE RATES OF PENETRATION, THEREBY IN- CREASING THE DRILLING COST. A KEY LIMITATION TO UNDERSTAND ING THE REDUCED RATES OF PENETRATION FOR DRILLING GEOTHERMALWELLS IS THE LACK OF AN UNDERSTANDING OF PENETRATION MECHANICS IN GEOTHERMAL ROCKS UNDER DOWNHOLE CONDITIONS. T THIS PROGRAM WILL DRILL REPRESENTATIVE GEOTHERMAL ROCK SAMPLE UNDER SIMULATED DOWNHOLE CONDITIONS WITH FULL-SCALE DRILL BITS AND MEASURE THE PARAMETERS ASSOCIATED WITH DRILLING. SEVERAL ROCK CHARACTERIZATION TESTS SUCH AS MECHANICAL PROPERTIES, POROSITY, GRAIN DENSITY, GRAIN SIZE DISTRIBUTION, PERMEABILITY AND X-RAY DIFFRACTTION, WILL BE PERFORMED ON THE REPRESENTATIVE ROCK SAMPLES. THE DRILLING PERFORMANCE WILL THEN BE CORRELATED WITH THE ROCK PROPERTIESTHROUGH A MATHEMATICAL MODEL. THE GOALS OF THIS PROGRAM AREFOUR-FOLD: 1. ESTABLISH A MATRIX OF ROCK DRILLABILITY FOR AT LEAST FIVE DIFFERENT METHODS OF ROCK PENETRATION I INCLUDING: CRUSHING, SPALLING, SHEARING, EROSION AND SHOCK LOADING. 2. ESTABLISH A DATA BASE OF ROCK CHARACTERIZATION STUDIES FOR GEOTHERMAL ROCKS. 3. DETERMINE THE TEMPERATURE EFFECTS ON THE ROCK PROPERTIES.4. USING THE DATA BASE ON ROCK CHARACTERIZATION AND ROCK DRILLABILITY, DEVELOP A MATHEMATICAL MODEL TO PREDICT PERFORMANCE OF ROCK PENETRATION DEVICES. 2",

THIS ALGORITHM USES LOER CODING TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECT OF BIT ERRORS AND THE DQI SIGNAL TO TRIGGER INTER-FRAME SMOOTHING OF LPC MODEL PARAMETERS. THE LOER CODING SCHEME IS IMPLEMENTED IN A REAL TIME VOICE DIGITIZER. THE DQI SIGNAL IS IMPLEMENTED IN A MOBILE SATELLITE MODEM.

THE INNOVATIVE CONCEPT PRESENTED HEREIN CAN PROVIDE LOW RATE COMMUNICATIONS ESSENTIALLY IMMUNE FROM THESE INTERFERENCES. THIS PROPOSED CONCEPT USES INDUCED SEISMIC WAVES TO PROVIDE ROBUST COMMUNICATIONS. DEEP UNDERGROUND BASING COULD EXPERIENCE ONE-WAY RANGES UP TO 10 NM AND BANDWIDTHS OF SOME 20 HZ, OR MORE. MOBILE SURFACE BASING COULD EXPERIENCE RANGES OF 20 NM AND BANDWIDTHS OF 40 HZ, OR MORE. THESE COMMUNICATIONS WOULD BE IMMUNE FROM NATURAL OR MAN INDUCED, ELECTRICAL OR MECHANICAL INTERFERENCE. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS PHASE I EFFORT WILL BE TO CONCEPTUALLY DESIGN THE SYSTEM AND FORECAST ITS PERFORMANCE. TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO REVIEW THE EXISTING ANALYSIS BASE, MODEL THE TRANSMISSION MEDIA, CONCEPTUALLY DESIGN THE TRANSMITTER AND RECEIVER ELEMENTS, AND FORECAST PERFORMANCE USING THE EXISTING EMPIRICAL DATA AND MODELED ENVIRONMENTS. THE RESULT WILL BE QUANTATIVE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FEASIBILITY AND OPERATING PARAMETERS OF THIS METHOD OF ROBUST COMMUNICATIONS.",

A SINGLE LAYER ANTI-REFLECTIVE FILM HAS THE IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTIC OF IMPROVING THE TRANSMISSION OF THE SUBSTRATE AT ALL WAVELENGTHS EVEN THOUGH IT DOES NOT HAVE THE EXTREME TRANSMISSION CAPABILITY OF MULTILAYER FILMS AT ANY ONE WAVELENGTH. DEVELOPMENT OF AN INHOMOGENEOUS SINGLE LAYER FILM WILL RETAIN THE BROAD BAND FEATURE AND IMPROVE THE TRANSMISSION OF THE SUBSTRATE OVER THE SIMPLE SINGLE LAYER FILM. OXIDATION OF A SILICON SUBSTRATE PRODUCING ANTI-REFLECTING FILMS ON BOTH SIDES MEETS THE REQUIREMENT OF BROAD BAND TRANSMISSION WITH EXTREMELY HIGH RESISTANCE TO DAMAGE FROM LASERS OR HIGH ENERGY RADIATION. THE INHOMOGENEOUS ANTI-REFLECTING FILM MAY BE CREATED USING CONTROLLED ION IMPLANTATION OF SILICON OR OXYGEN ATOMS. A SILICON WINDOW CONSTRUCTED IN SUCH A MANNER WILL SERVE AS A HIGH TRANSMISSION WINDOW AND A FILTER FOR WAVELENGTHS LESS THAN ONE MICRON. THIS WINDOW WOULD BE HIGHLY RESISTANT TO DAMAGE FROM RADIATION INCREASING THE LIFETIME OF INSTRUMENTS IN CORROSIVE ATMOSPHERES AND HIGH INTENSITY ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS.",

IT IS SAID THAT A JET ENGINE WITH UNPROTECTED TURBINE BLADES CANNOT MAKE A SINGLE TRANSATLANTIC FLIGHT BECAUSE OF OXIDATION. NICKEL-BASE SUPERALLOYS THAT ARE USED IN THE HOT SECTIONS ARE PROTECTED BY OXIDATION RESISTANT SURFACE COATINGS. THE COATING TECHNOLOGY FOLLOWS THE DEVELOPMENT IN NICKEL-BASE SUPERALLOYS. THERE IS A RISING ECONOMIC PRESSURE TO ENHANCE THE OXIDATION RESISTANCE OF BARE ALLOYS AND THE COATING PERFORMANCE. THIS PRESSURE IS DUE TO THE HIGH COST OF MANUFACTURING AND REPLACEMENT OF HOT SECTION COMPONENTS. INNOVATIVE METHODS ARE THEREFORE REQUIRED TO MITIGATE THE OXIDATION PROBLEMS. MODIFICATION OF SURFACE CHEMISTRY BY ION BEAMS IS CONSIDERED AS A POTENTIAL METHOD TO ENHANCE THE OXIDATION RESISTANCE OF BARE ALLOYS AND/OR THE COATING PERFORMANCE. THE TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY OF THIS APPROACH IS CONSIDERED IN PHASE I IN RELATION TO THE NICKEL-BASE SUPERALLOY SINGLE CRYSTALS THAT ARE SELECTED FOR APPLICATION IN THE 1980S JET ENGINES. COMBINATIONS OF SURFACE CHEMISTRY MODIFICATION AND COATING WILL BE CONSIDERED. ISOTHERMAL AND CYCLIC OXIDATION TESTS ARE PLANNED TO ALONG WITH THE SURFACE MICROSTRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION BE ADVANCED TECHNIQUES TO ESTABLISH THE EFFICIENCY OF THE PROCESS.",

HOWEVER, THERE IS LITTLE EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE WHICH CONFIRMS THAT LIPOSOMES ACTUALLY TARGET CHEMOTHERAPY TO SOLID TUMORS. THE OVERALL GOALS OF THIS SBIR PROJECT ARE: 1) TO VERIFY THAT SMALL VESICLES WITH COMPOSITIONS WHICH ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THEIR STABILITY, CAN BE LOADED WITH SELECTED ANTITUMOR DRUGS, 2) TO PROVE THAT SUCH DRUG LOADED LIPOSOMES CAN INCREASE DRUG UPTAKE IN EXPERIMENTAL TUMORS WHILE DECREASING THE LEVEL OF DRUG IN CRITICAL NORMAL TISSUES, AND 3) TO ESTABLISH THAT SUCH VESICLE TARGETING OF CHEMOTHERAPY CAN INCREASE ANTITUMOR EFFICACY WHILE DECREASING THE TOXIC SIDE EFFECTS. DURING PHASE I, VESICLE FORMULATIONS PREPARED FROM PURE PHOSPHOLIPIDS AND CHOLESTEROL WILL BE LOADED WITH DOXORUBICIN, A DRUG WITH CARDIOTOXIC SIDE EFFECTS. DRUG LOADED LIPOSOMES AND UNENCAPSULATED DOXORUBICIN WILL BE INJECTED INTRAVENOUSLY INTO SEPARATE SETS OF MICE BEARING SOLID LEWIS LUNG CARCINOMA TUMORS. AT VARIOUS TIMES AFTER INJECTION, BLOOD, TUMOR, AND HEART TISSUE WILL BE REMOVED AND EXTRACTED WITH 10 M UREA, AND THE EXTRACT WILL BE ANALYZED FOR DOXORUBICIN. A HIGH PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY APPARATUS WITH A SENSITIVE FLUORESCENCE DETECTOR WILL BE USED TO SEPARATE THE PARENT DRUG FROM ITS METABOLITES. QUANTITATIVE DATA ON THE DRUG CONCENTRATIONS IN EACH TISSUE WILL BE OBTAINED. BASED ON PREVIOUS RESULTS WITH VESICLE ENCAPSULATED RADIOISOTOPE, TUMOR UPTAKE OF VESICLE ENCAPSULATED DRUG IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE, COMPARED TO CONCENTRATIONS ATTAINED WITH FREE DRUG. A TWO-FOLD OR GREATER INCREASE IN TUMOR DRUG EXPOSURE IS THOUGHT TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT THERAPEUTIC IMPLICATIONS. THUS, IF SUCH AN INCREASE IS OBSERVED, PHASE II OF THE PROJECT, TESTING TOXICOLOGY AND THERAPY OF VESICLE ENCAPSULATED DOXORUBICIN WILL BE INITIATED. THE RECOGNITION THAT ONLY THE SMALLEST VESICLES, WHICH ARE STABLE TO LEAKAGE OF ENCAPSULATED MATERIAL WHILE CIRCULATING IN THE BLOOD, ARE CAPABLE OF TUMOR TARGETING MAY LEAD TO A RENEWED INTEREST IN THESE ENTITIES. IF FAVORABLE TUMOR TARGETING CAN BE DEMONSTRATED, THIS APPROACH COULD HAVE WIDESPREAD HEALTH BENEFITS AND COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITIES EXIST FOR REDUCING THE DRAG OF AIRCRAFT BY INCREASING THE EXTENT OF LAMINAR BOUNDARY-LAYER FLOW OVER THE CONFIGURATION. RECENT TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN AIRPLANE CONSTRUCTION TECHNIQUES AND MATERIALS EMPLOYING BONDED AND MILLED ALUMINUM SKINS AND COMPOSITE MATERIALS ALLOW FOR THE PRODUCTION OF AERODYNAMIC SURFACES WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT ROUGHNESS AND WAVINESS, PERMITTING LONG RUNS OF NATURAL LAMINAR FLOW (NLF). ALSO, IMPROVED AERODYNAMIC DESIGN AND ANALYSIS METHODS FACILITATE THE SHAPING OF AIRPLANE SURFACES TO OBTAIN FLOW CONDITIONS FAVORABLE TO NLF. A MAJOR PORTION OF THE RESEARCH EFFORT FOR OBTAINING AND MAINTAINING LAMINAR FLOW ON AIRPLANE SURFACES HAS FOCUSED ON THE DELAY OF LAMINAR-TO-TURBULENT BOUNDARY-LAYER TRANSITION ON AIRPLANE LIFTING SURFACES. BODY SHAPING TO INCREASE THE EXTENT OF LAMINAR FLOW ON AIRPLANE FUSELAGES HAS RECEIVED MUCH LESS ATTENTION IN THE LITERATURE. A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN AIRPLANE DRAG CAN BE OBTAINED, HOWEVER, WHEN NLF IS ACHIEVED ON THE FUSELAGE OF AN AIRPLANE. THE PHASE I OBJECTIVES ARE TO EVALUATE THE VARIOUS COMPUTATIONAL DESIGN AND ANALYSIS METHODS WHICH CAN BE APPLIED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOW-DRAG AERODYNAMIC FUSELAGE SHAPES AND TO ADDRESS THE ANALYTICAL DESIGN OF BODY SHAPES OF SEVERAL FUSELAGES AT FREE-STREAM UNIT REYNOLDS NUMBERS OF 1.5-3.0 MILLION PER FOOT. THE MOST PROMISING CONFIGURATION(S) WILL BE WIND-TUNNEL AND/OR FLIGHT TESTED DURING PHASE II.",

APART FROM THESE, THE FLOWFIELD AROUND THE SPACE SHUTTLE ORBITER ALSO SHOWS SIGNIFICANT NONEQUILIBRIUM EFFECTS. FURTHERMORE, IT HAS BEEN RECENTLY RECOGNIZED THAT THE SURFACE CATALYSIS PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE SURFACE HEAT-TRANSFER OF SPACECRAFTS UNDER NONEQUILIBIRUM FLOW CONDITIONS.

THIS PROPOSAL DESCRIBES A UNIQUE METHOD OF READING CHARACTERS, EVEN THOSE PRESENTED IN A MISORIENTED MANNER. IT TAKES THE \"CONNECTIVITY\" CONCEPT FOUND IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SOFTWARE AND CONVERTS IT TO HARDWARE. STARTING WITH THIS HARDWARE CONNECTIVITY BOARD, ADDITIONS ARE MADE TO IT TO PERMIT THE IN-LINE READING OF CHARACTERS. THESE ADDITIONS AND CHANGES WILL INCLUDE: TRANSMISSION OF THE IMAGE TO A VISION MODULE FOR RE-ORIENTATION; TRANSIENT STORAGE OF THE IMAGE (E.G. A FULL PAGE); VIEWING EACH CHARACTER FROM THE FOUR CARDINAL DIRECTIONS; ACCESS TO BLOB CONNECTION POINTS. EACH CHARACTER IS LOOKED UPON AS A CONNECTED OBJECT WHICH IS CONSTRUCTED FROM A SERIES OF BLOBS. THIS UPGRADED CONNECTIVITY BOARD CAN ITSELF GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS THE UNIQUE DETERMINATION OF EACH VIEWED CHARACTER BY EXTRACTING TWO NEW FEATURES, THE NUMBER OF LAKES IN THE CHARACTER AND THE DIRECTIONS OF ITS BAYS AND BY COMPARING THEM TO THOSE CATALOGUED IN A LOOK UP TABLE. THERE ARE A FEW SETS OF CHARACTERS THAT HAVE IDENTICAL BAY AND HOLE FEATURES (E.G. C,F,G). IN SUCH CASES, THE MACHINE VISION MODULE USED IN ASSOCIATION WITH THIS CONNECTION CONCEPT, MEASURES EACH CHARACTER'S FEATURES (CENTROID, AREA, PERIMETER) AGAIN IN REAL TIME, TO DETERMINE THE CHARACTER UNIQUELY. FONT INDEPENDENCE IS POSSIBLE BY A LATER ADDITION OF A SERIF REMOVAL CIRCUIT. THE TECHNIQUE IS APPLICABLE TO BOTH CAPITAL AND SMALL LETTERS AND CAN BE EXTENDED TO CHINESE, ISLAMIC AND MORE COMPLEX PICTOGRAMS.",

THIS PROPOSAL SUGGESTS AN APPROACH THAT WOULD REVIEW THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE TO IDENTIFY THE MAJOR HUMAN PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT METHODS THAT HAVE BEEN USED TO ASSESS OPERATOR PERFORMANCE IN A DYNAMIC VEHICLE. THESE RESEARCH REPORTS WILL BE FURTHER EXAMINED TO DETERMINE THE APPLICABILITY OF EACH MAJOR APPROACH TO PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT IN MILITARY VEHICLES.

CURRENT OXYGEN MASKS ARE OF LITTLE VALUE SINCE, WITHOUT A DEPRESSURIZATION, THEY DO NOT SUPPLY SUFFICIENT OXYGEN, AND THE MASK DESIGN IS SUCH THAT AMBIENT SMOKE AND TOXIC GASES ARE ALL TO ENTER THE USER'S LUNGS. THIS PROPOSAL DESCRIBES A STUDY THAT IS AN EXTENSION OF THE WORK BY DESTEIGUER AND SALDIVAR OF THE CIVIL AEROMEDICAL INSTITUTE OF THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (REFERENCE 1). IN THAT WORK, PASSENGER OXYGEN MASKS WERE MODIFIED TO INCORPORATE A \"CONTROLLED-USE REBREATHER RESERVOIR\". WHILE THIS APPROACH IMPROVED THE PASSENGER OXYGEN MASK IT STILL REQUIRED MORE OXYGEN THAN MOST CURRENT AIRCRAFT CAN SUPPLY. WE PROPOSE TO INCORPORATE A CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) ABSORBER IN THE REBREATHER RESERVOIR TO REDUCE THE OXYGEN REQUIREMENTS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE LEVELS AND TO REDUCE THE HIGH CO2 LEVELS IN THE REBREATHER MASK.

THE TYPICAL ELECTRICAL RESPONSE OBSERVED OVER A HYDROCARBON ACCUMULATION IS A LOW-RESISTIVITY VERTICAL COLUMN OR PLUME WHICH EXTENDS FROM THE TRAP TO, OR VERY CLOSE TO, THE SURFACE. THE RESISTIVITY WITHIN THIS PLUME IS TYPICALLY 20% TO 40% BELOW THE AVERAGE BACKGROUND RESPONSE. EARLIER INVESTIGATIONS OF ELECTRICAL PHENOMENON OVER OIL AND GAS FIELDS WERE MADE PREDOMINATELY WITH DIPOLE-DIPOLE IP TECHNIQUE. THIS TECHNIQUE HAS A) VERY POOR LATERAL RESOLUTION AND B) IS VERY SUSCEPTIBLE TO CONTAMINATION FROM MAN-MADE ELECTRICALLY GROUNDED STRUCTURES. THESE TWO FEATURES LEAD MOST RESEARCHERS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT ELECTRICAL TECHNIQUES WERE NOT VIABLE EXPLORATION TOOLS. CSAMT, A HIGH-RESOLUTION RESISTIVITY SOUNDING TECHNIQUE, NOW APPEARS TO HAVE THE SENSITIVITY AND LATERAL RESOLUTION TO ADEQUATELY DELINEATE SUBSURFACE GEOCHEMICAL ALTERATION ABOVE OIL AND GAS FIELDS. CSAMT IS A FAR-FIELD TECHNIQUE WHICH IS CONSIDERABLY LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO CONTAMINATION FROM GROUNDED STRUCTURE. CSAMT APPEARS TO BE A VIABLE EXPLORATION TOOL WHICH CAN BE UTILIZED FOR BOTH STRATIGRAPHIC AND STRUCTURAL TRAPS.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         I. SPECIFIC AIMS A. INTRODUCTION - ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING APPROACHES TO THE TREATMENT OF LYMPOCYTIC MALIGNANCIES IS THE USE OF MONOCLONAL ANTI--IDIOTYPIC ANTIBODIES DIRECTED AGAINST THE SURFACE IMMUNOGLOBULIN OF MALIGNANT B LYMPHOCYTES. SUCH REAGENTS COMBINE WITH MALIGNANT LYMPHOCYTES BUT NOT WITH NORMAL CELLS. THE MOST CONCRETE SUCCESS WITH THIS APPROACH WAS REPORTED BY A GROUP UNDER DR. RON LEVY AT STANFORD. IN A PATIENT EFFLICTED WITH DIFFUSE, POORLY DIFFERENTIATED LYMPHOCYTIC LYMPHOMA, MONOCLONAL ANTI-IDIOTYPIC ANTIBODY INDUCED A COMPLETE REMISSION WHICH HAS CONTINUED FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. ALTHOUGH NO FURTHER CLINICAL TRIALS HAVE BEEN REPORTED, THE APPROACH SEEMS SO PROMISING THAT BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER HAS INITIATED RESEARCH INTO THE PRODUCTION OF ANTI-IDIOTYPIC ANTIBODIES FOR THIS PURPOSE. THE PROCESS OF PRODUCING THESE ANTIBODIES CONSISTS OF MANY STEPS, BUT ONE OF THESE, THE SOMATIC CELL HYBRIDIZATION OF MALIGNANT B LYMPHOCYTES FOR ISOLATION OF MALIGNANT CELL SURFACE IMMUNOGLOBULIN, PRESENTS A PARTICULAR PROBLEM BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF LYMPHOCYTE CELLS AVAILABLE FROM ALL BUT EXTREMELY ILL PATIENTS. RECENTLY A NEW FUSION TECHNIQUE HAS BEEN EXPLORED WHICH USES ELECTRONIC RATHER THAN CHEMICAL FORCES TO INDUCE FUSION. THIS ELECTRONIC CELL FUSION TECHNIQUE OFFERS MANY ATTRACTIVE FEATURES BUT THE MOST CRITICAL IS ITS ABILITY TO FUSE VERY SMALL NUMBERS OF CELLS WITH EXTREMELY HIGH FUSION FREQUENCY. WE HAVE CONDUCTED INITIAL FUSION EXPERIMENTS ON BOTH MOUSE AND HUMAN CELLS WITH THIS TECHNIQUE AND HAVE ACHIEVED VERY PROMISING RESULTS. WE PROPOSE TO CONDUCT RESEARCH ON THE ELECTRONIC CELL FUSION TECHNIQUE AND COLLABORATE WITH BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER IN APPLYING IT TO THEIR PROJECT. BY THE CONCLUSION OF THE PHASE I - PHASE II PROGRAM, THE ELECTRONIC CELL FUSION TECHNIQUE SHOULD BE AVAILABLE AS A WIDELY USED TOOL FOR CANCER RESEARCH AND THE WORK AT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER SHOULD BE ACCELERATED.",
