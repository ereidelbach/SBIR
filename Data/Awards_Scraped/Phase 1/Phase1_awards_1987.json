THIS METHOD WILL PERMIT DETECTION OF ANY ABNORMALITIES THAT AFFECT THE RRP, AS THE PARAMETERS CAN BE ADJUSTED SO THAT THERE IS DECREMENT IN THE RESPONSE TO THE SECOND STIMULUS, IN NORMALS. THE THREE-CHANNEL LISSAJOUS TRAJECTORY OF THE ABR WILL BE ANALYZED WITH RESPECT TO BOTH LINEAR AND PLANAR SEGMENTS. THE USE OF STIMULUS PAIRS PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESPONSES TO BOTH THE FIRST AND THE SECOND STIMULUS (IN THE RRP). THIS METHODOLOGY IS LIKELY TO BE MORE SENSITIVE TO PATHOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE AUDITORY NERVOUS SYSTEM THAN IS THE ABR, WHICH HAS HAD EXTENSIVE USE IN AUDIOLOGY AND NEUROLOGY AS AN OBJECTIVE MEASURE OF BRAINSTEM NORMALITY OR ABNORMALITY.",

ROBOTIC WINDING SYSTEMS (ROWS) WAS INVENTED BY THE PRINCIPLEINVESTIGATOR IN AN ATTEMPT TO CREATE AN AUTOMATED TECHNIQUE OF LAYING UP PRE-IMPREGNATED MATERIAL AROUND A FORM WITH COMPLEX SHAPE. CONVENTIONAL WINDING EQUIPMENT REQUIRES THE MANDREL TO ROTATE WHILE THE MATERIAL IS DRAGGED ALONG THE AXIS OF SYMMETRY. BY MAINTAINING A STATIONARY MANDREL, FILAMENT PLACEMENT, AS COMPARED TO DRAGGING FILAMENT, IS A MORE PRECISE PROCESS. DURING DEVELOPMENT OF THIS TECHNIQUE FOR PRE-IMPREGNATED THERMOSETTING MATERIALS, THE PRINCIPLE INVESTIGATOR WAS EXPOSED TO AN EXCITING PROCESS AT THE GENERAL ELECTRIC R&D; CENTER OF USING A PLASMA-SPRAY MATERIAL DEPOSITION TECHNIQUE IN A HIGH TEMPERATURE VACUUM VESSEL. THE INNOVATION DESCRIBED IN THIS PROPOSAL IS A MARRIAGE OF THE TWO PROCESSES. ROWS OFFERS A METHOD OF REINFORCING STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS WITH SIC AND SI3N4 CERAMIC FILAMENTS WHILE USING METAL MATERIALS PROCESSED WITH RAPID SOLIDIFICATION PLASMA DEPOSITION. THIS PROGRAM WILL ESTABLISH THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS PROCESS BY EVALUATING THE PROCESS PARAMETERS. BY BUILDING A MECHANISM AND DEMONSTRATING REINFORCED MATERIALS BEING WOUND DIRECTLY INSIDE THIS HIGH TEMPERATURE VACUUM ENVIRONMENT, THE INNOVATIVE PROCESS WILL RESULT IN A TECHNIQUE TO FABRICATE COMPLEX SHAPES IN VOID-FREE SPACE UNDER PRECISELY CONTROLLED CONDITIONS.",

THE INNOVATION IS TO USE INDEPENDENTLY TARGETED PARTICLES OF METAL OR COMPOSITE METAL TO BUILD STRUCTURES UNDER COMPUTER CONTROL IN MUCH THESAME MANNER THAT A PRINTER PRODUCES TWO-DIMENSIONAL IMAGES. A STRUCTURE WOULD BE CONSTRUCTED BY \"WRITING\" MULTIPLE CROSS SECTIONS TO A TARGET OR SEED PARTICLE WITH COLD WELDING OR RAPID SOLIDIFICATION PROVIDING COHESION BETWEEN PARTICLES. THIS INNOVATION HOLDS THE PROMISE OF AUTOMATICALLY PRODUCING PARTS IN ONE STEP WHICH REQUIRE SEVERAL UNIT OPERATIONS USING PRESENT POWDER METALLURGICAL TECHNIQUES. MATERIAL PROPERTIES ASSOCIATED WITH RAPID SOLIDIFICATION PLASMA DEPOSITION (RSPD) COULD BE IMPARTED WITH MUCH GREATER ACCURACY AND BETTER CONTROL OF PROCESS PARAMETERS. BALLISTIC POWDER METALLURGY (BPM) IS THE NEW TERM GIVEN TO DESCRIBE THIS INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         DURING THE PAST 20 YEARS, DIFFERENT BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED FOR LYMPHOKINES PRODUCED BY ACTIVATED LEUKOCYTES. INTERLEUKIN-1 (IL-1) IS A FACTOR PRODUCED BY ACTIVATED MONONUCLEAR PHAGOCYTES AND IS ESSENTIAL FOR SUPPORTING BOTH T-CELL AND B-CELL RESPONSES. ACTIVATED T CELLS PRODUCE INTERLEUKIN-2 (IL-2), A FACTOR NECESSARY FOR T-CELL PROLIFERATION. THIS SOLUBLE FACTOR EXERTS ITS BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS BY INTERACTING WITH SPECIFIC HIGH-AFFINITY RECEPTORS ON THE SURFACE OF ACTIVATED T CELLS.A DECREASE IN THE ABILITY TO PRODUCE IL-2 AND DYSFUNCTION OFINTERLEUKIN-2 RECEPTORS (IL-2RS) HAVE BEEN FOUND IN SEVERAL DISEASES, INCLUDING AUTOIMMUNITY, GRAFT VERSUS HOST REJECTION, ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY, LYMPHOADENOPATHY, ANDCANCER. THUS A STRONG RATIONALE EXISTS FOR THE INVESTIGATION OF IL-2 AND IL-2R. PHASE I OF THIS STUDY WILL DEVELOP A SENSITIVE ELISA ASSAY FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF IL-2 AND IL-2R IN THE SAME SAMPLE OF CULTURED LYMPHOCYTES; DETERMINE THE OPTIMAL CONDITIONS FOR THE ASSAY; AND DETERMINE THE SENSITIVITY OF THE ASSAY BY COMPARISON WITH A BIOASSAY. PHASE II WILL INVOLVE THE MEASUREMENT OF IL-2 AND IL-2R IN NORMAL SUBJECTS AND IN PATIENTS WITH CANCER, AIDS, ARTHRITIS, SLE, AND PEMPHIGUS, AS WELL AS IN TRANSPLANTATION SUBJECTS AND OTHERS. WHEN SUFFICIENT CLINICAL DATA HAVE BEEN ACCUMULATED, THE ASSAY WILL BE CONVERTED INTO KIT FORM FOR RESEARCH AND CLINICAL USE.",

THE LEADING CAUSE OF THESE INFECTIONS IS URINARY CATHETERIZATION, WHICH IN TURN IS THE MOST COMMON PREDISPOSING FACTOR FOR FATAL GRAM-NEGATIVE SEPSIS IN HOSPITALS. THE LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE OF IONTOPHORETIC CATHETER RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP A DEVICE TO PREVENT CATHETER-RELATED URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS. THE ULTIMATE CONFIGURATION ENVISIONED CONSISTS OF A SPECIALLY DESIGNED FOLEY-STYLE CATHETER CONTAINING TWO METAL ELECTRODES WITHIN THE DRAINAGE LUMEN. PROVISION IS MADE FOR CONNECTING THE ELECTRODE LEADS TO A MICROAMPERE CONSTANT CURRENT POWER SUPPLY. THE CATHETER IS THUS MODIFIED FOR IONTOPHORESIS APPLICATION. PRELIMINARY MICROBIOLOGICAL TESTING SHOWS THAT NOBLE METAL IONTOPHORESISCAN KILL VARIOUS BACTERIAL GENERA. THE RESEARCH PROPOSED IN THIS PHASE I STUDY IS DIRECTED AT DETERMINING FEASIBILITY OF THIS CONCEPT BY (1) A COMPLETE SCREENING TEST CONSISTING OF PARAMETRIC EVALUATION OF POTENTIAL ELECTRODE MATERIALS, SEVERAL BACTERIAL GENERA, AND LEVELS OF ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE; (2) THE CONDUCT OF ELECTRODE RELIABILITY/SURVIVAL EVALUATION IN A SUITABLE MEDIUM; AND (3) THE DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF A URODYNAMIC EVALUATION SYSTEM FOR SUBSEQUENT EVALUATION IN THE DYNAMIC FLUID FLOW MODE.",

THE INTEGRITY OF BONDED SURFACES IN THE Y-JOINT AND RESTRICTER REGIONS OF LARGE SOLID BOOSTERS, SUCH AS TITAN 34D MOTORS, IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A CRITICAL APPLICATION WITHOUT A DEPENDABLE INSPECTION METHOD. IN FULLY ASSEMBLED T34D MOTORS, THESE ZONES, WHICH ARE THE MOST CRITICAL TO SYSTEM RELIABILITY, ARE ALSO THE MOST INACCESSIBLE TO STANDARD EXAMINATION TECHNIQUES. A COMPUTER TOMOGRAPHY (CT) SYSTEM WOULD IN THEORY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE AN INSPECTION CAPABILITY WHICH COULD ADDRESS THIS CRUCIAL QA PROBLEM, BUT THE SIZE AND OPACITY OF SOLID BOOSTERS PRECLUDES THE USE OF EVEN THE MOST ENERGETIC RADIATION SOURCES USED TO DATE. AN INNOVATIVE CT CONCEPT EMPLOYING BREMSSTRAHLUNG RADIATION WITH PEAK ENERGIES TWO TO FOUR TIMES AS GREAT AS THE HIGHEST EVER USED FOR CT IS PROPOSED. DESIGNATED SUPERVOLTAGE CT, THE NOVEL INSPECTION TECHNIQUE WOULD PROVIDE A UNIQUE CAPABILITY FOR DETERMINING THE IN-SITU INTEGRITY OF BONDED STRUCTURES IN LARGE AEROSPACE COMPONENTS. A SERIES OF MEASUREMENTS TO EVALUATE THE KEY TECHNICAL UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPROACH AND TO THUS MAKE THE FIRST DEFINITIVE DETERMINATION OF EFFICACY OF THE CONCEPT IS PROPOSED.",

THESE TRACE GASES ARE CHEMICALLY ACTIVE AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO ALTER THE COMPOSITIONS OF THE RADIATIVELY-ACTIVE SPECIES WHICH, TO A LARGE EXTENT, DETERMINE THE OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF THE ATMOSPHERE AND CONTROL THE EARTH'S CLIMATE. BECAUSE OF THE LONG RESIDENCE TIMES OF THESE SPECIES, THE IMPACT IN THE ATMOSPHERE MAY LAST FOR YEARS INSTEAD OF MONTHS AS IN THE CASE OF DUST AND SOOT INJECTION.WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE THESE EFFECTS USING A 1-D MODEL OF THE ATMOSPHERE WITH INTERACTIVE TREATMENT OF RADIATION, CHEMISTRY, AND DYNAMICS.

SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL DETERMINE; IF IGNITION OF LEAN OR LOW PRESSURE MIXTURES CAN BE MADE MORE RELIABLE; IF FLAME HOLDING LIMITS CAN BE BROADENED, E.G., TO LEANER MIXTURES OR TO HIGHER VELOCITIES; OR IF THE CLASSICAL MECHANICAL FLAME-HOLDER CAN BE REPLACED OR AUGMENTED BY A SUPERSONIC JET CONTAINING A HIGH DEGREE OF NONEQUILIBRIUM EXCITATION AND DISSOCIATION. THE AEROCHEM NONEQUILIBRIUM PLASMA JET IS PRODUCED BY PASSING A GAS, E.G., O2, H2, OR AIR THROUGH A GLOW DISCHARGE AND EXPANDING IT THROUGH A NOZZLE TO PRODUCE A SUPERSONIC STREAM.

MOST ADVANCES HAVE BEEN MADE USING EITHER PETUNIA OR NICOTIANA AS A MODEL EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEM, MAINLY BECAUSE THESE PLANTS RESPOND WELL FOR REGENERATION IN CELL CULTURE. THERE IS AN OBVIOUS NEED TO EXTEND THESE STUDIES TO OTHER SPECIES, FOREST TREES IN PARTICULAR, WHICH POSE UNIQUE PROBLEMS FOR REGENERATION IN CELL CULTURES. THE TWO MAIN OBJECTIVES OF THE PROPOSED STUDY ARE: TO DEVELOP PROTOCOLS FOR TRANSFORMATION OF WHITE PINE (PINUS STROBUS) EMBRYONIC TISSUE; AND TO ANALYZE THE REGULATION OF FOREIGN GENE EXPRESSION BY LIGHT IN PINUS STROBUS. THE PROPOSED STUDIES WILL INVOLVE BOTH THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROTOCOLS FOR TRANSFORMATION AS WELL AS GATHERING OF INFORMATION ON REGULATION OF GENE EXPRESSION IN THE TRANSFORMED PLANTS. SELECTED GENOTYPES OF EASTERN WHITE PINE WILL BE USED FOR GENETIC TRANSFORMATION BY AGROBACTERIUM TUMEFACIENS STRAINS CONTAINING SPECIFIC MARKER GENES WHICH WILL ALLOW AN EASY AND RELIABLE SYSTEM FOR SELECTION OF THE TRANSFORMANTS, AND THE STUDY OF CONSTITUTIVE AS WELL AS LIGHT-INDUCED REGULATION OF GENE EXPRESSION. A TUMEFACIENS STRAINS TO BE USED IN THIS STUDY CONTAIN CODING SEQUENCES OF TWO BACTERIAL GENES, NEOMYCINE PHOSPHOTRANSFERASE (NPTII) AND CHLORAMPHENICOL ACETYL TRANSFERASE (CAT), COINTEGRATED WITH PROMOTERS OF EITHER AGROBACTERIUM OR PLANT ORIGIN. THE TRANSFORMED SHOOTS WILL BE SELECTED BY THEIR ABILITY TO GROW ON KANAMYCIN (NPT GENE RESPONSE) AND ANALYZED FOR ENZYME ACTIVITIES OF NPT AND CAT. THE COVALENT INTEGRATION OF THESE SEQUENCES IN THE DNA OF PLANT CELLS WILL BE CONFIRMED BY SOUTHERN HYBRIDIZATION OF GENOMIC DNA WITH SPECIFIC PROBES FOR EACH GENE.",

UNFORTUNATELY, GAS FILLED DETECTORS SUFFER FROM A NUMBER OF DEFICIENCIES INCLUDING LARGE SIZE (GASES HAVE LOW VOLUMETRIC EFFICIENCY FOR STOPPING NEUTRONS), MECHANICAL FRAGILITY, AND HIGH VOLTAGE MEASUREMENTS. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A NEW FORM OF SOLID STATE NEUTRON DETECTOR FROM THE SEMICONDUCTING COMPOUND BORON PHOSPHIDE. BORON PHOSPHIDE POSSESSES MOST OF THE DESIRABLE ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES OF SIMILAR III-V COMPOUNDS, WHICH HAVE ALLOWED PRODUCTION OF SEMICONDUCTING DETECTORS FROM GAAS AND INP. BECAUSE BORON PHOSPHIDE IS A SOLID THAT CONTAINS BORON AS A STOICHIOMETRIC COMPONENT, IT HAS A HIGH STOPPING EFFICIENCY FOR THERMAL NEUTRONS. USEFUL CRYSTALS OF BORON PHOSPHIDE ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN DUE TO THEIR HIGH MELTING POINT. RECENTLY, HOWEVER, RESEARCHERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GROW THICK FILMS ON SILICON SUBSTRATES BY CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION METHODS. IT IS PROPOSED TO USE SIMILAR TECHNIQUES TO GROW BP/SI HETEROJUNCTION DIODES CAPABLE OF EFFICIENT NEUTRON DETECTION.

A PAIR OF MSSW RESONATOR CONTROLLED OSCILLATORS WHOSE DIFFERENTIAL OUTPUT FREQUENCY IS PROPORTIONAL TO MAGNETIC FIELD IS PROPOSED. A RARE-EARTH MAGNET PROVIDES THE NECESSARY BIAS WHILE REMAINING TRANSPARENT TO EXTERNAL MAGNET FIELDS. PRELIMINARY CALCULATIONS INDICATE A RESOLUTION OF <0.20 NANOTESLA AND A DYNAMIC RANGE OF 10 TO THE 9TH POWER (2000 OE) CAN BE ACHIEVED. EXTERNAL BIAS FIELDS OF OVER 100 OE CAN BE ACCOMMODATED AND FREQUENCIES FROM DC TO 1000 HZ COVERED. THE PROPOSED SENSOR REQUIRES MINIMAL CIRCUITRY AND UTILIZES LOW-POWER CMOS COUNTERS WHICH INTERFACE DIRECTLY TO DIGITAL EQUIPMENTS WITHOUT A/D CONVERTERS.

HOWEVER, THE REQUIREMENTS FOR NONDESTRUCTIVE EVALUATION (NDE) OF CERAMIC MATERIALS RESULTING FROM COMPLEX GEOMETRY, INHOMOGENEITY, REDUCED FLAW SIZE, AND ADVERSE PROCESSING ENVIRONMENTS HAVE PRODUCED LONG INSPECTION TIMES AND HAVE REDUCED CONFIDENCE IN ESTIMATING COMPONENT INTEGRITY AND LIFETIME. ONE CLASS OF NDE SENSORS, BASED ON PHOTOACOUSTIC GENERATION AND ACOUSTO-OPTIC DETECTION OF ULTRASOUND, OFFERS IMPORTANT ADVANTAGES OVER CONVENTIONAL NDE TECHNIQUES. THIS PROGRAM INVOLVES A NOVEL LASER-BASED EXCITATION SYSTEM EMPLOYING PHOTO-ACOUSTIC GENERATION COMBINED WITH LASER SPECKLE INTERFEROMETRIC DETECTION. SPECIFIC PROGRAM OBJECTIVES INCLUDE THE LASER GENERATION OF ULTRASOUND IN ADVANCED MATERIALS; INVESTIGATION OF METHODS TO ACHIEVE A HIGH SPEED,HIGH RESOLUTION LASER EXCITATION SYSTEM FOR INTEGRATION WITH SENSITIVE ULTRASONIC IMAGING SYSTEMS; ACQUISITION OF FAMILIES OF TEST DATA FOR COMPARISON WITH OTHER NONCONTACTING NDE METHODS; AND DESIGN OF A PROTOTYPE SYSTEM.THE PHASE I PROGRAM SHOULD PROVIDE A NONCONTACTING, IN-PROCESS CHARACTERIZATION TECHNIQUE FOR LASER-BASED NDE OFADVANCED CERAMIC MATERIALS FOR EXTENSIVE DEVELOPMENT AND TEST WITH STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS IN HIGH TEMPERATURE HEAT ENGINES DURING PHASE II OF THE PROGRAM.",

LATE AFTER INFECTION, BACULOVIRUS-INFECTED CELLS PRODUCE PARACRYSTALLINE OCCLUSION BODIES THAT CONSIST PRIMARILY OF ASINGLE PROTEIN, POLYHEDRIN. AMERICAN BIOGENETIC SCIENCES, INC. INTENDS TO MODIFY THE POLYHEDRIN GENE OF AUTOGRAPHA CALIFORNICA TO GENERATE RECOMBINANT OCCULSION BODIES EXPOSING ANTIGENIC DETERMINANTSOF PATHOGENIC MICROORGANISMS. THIS REQUIRES (1) IDENTIFYINGTHE APPROPRIATE REGIONS OF THE POLYHEDRIN IN WHICH TO INSERT SEQUENCES ENCODING NEW ANTIGENIC DETERMINANTS, (2) CONSTRUCTING RECOMBINANT POLYHEDRIN GENES IN VITRO, (3) TRANSFERRING THE RECOMBINANT GENES INTO THE BACULOVIRUS GENOME, (4) EXPRESSING THE HYBRID GENE AND GENERATING RECOMBINANT OCCLUSION BODIES, AND (5) CHARACTERIZING NEW EPITOPES EXPRESSED ON THE RECOMBINANT CRYSTAL. ANTIGENIC DETERMINANTS OF WELL-CHARACTERIZED PROTEINS WILL BE USED TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF THE TECHNIQUE. LATER, ANTIGENIC DETERMINANTS OF PATHOGENS WILL BE EXPRESSED. THE SYSTEM OFFERS SEVERAL POTENTIAL ADVANTAGES, INCLUDING THE HIGH LEVEL OF EXPRESSION OF THE BACULOVIRUS EXPRESSION SYSTEM, THE EASE OF PURIFICATION OF OCCLUSION BODIES, AND THEIR PRODUCTION IN A SYSTEM FREE OF HUMAN PATHOGENS. IN ADDITION, THE OCCLUSION BODIES ARE LARGE STRUCTURES; THIS SHOULD ENHANCE THE IMMUNOGENICITY OF THE EXPOSED EPITOPES AND PERMIT THE PRESENTATION OF MANY COPIES OF THE ANTIGENIC DETERMINANT.",

THUS, THE HUMAN-COMPUTER RELATIONSHIP IS MOVING FROM THAT OF AN INTELLIGENT AGENT WHO IS A \"USER\" OF A COMPLEX TOOL TO ONE OF COOPERATING INTELLIGENT PARTNERS, IN MUCH THE SAME WAY THAT A TEAM OF HUMANS WORK AND INTERACTTO ACCOMPLISH A PARTICULAR GOAL. SYSTEMS OF THIS TYPE ARE BECOMING KNOWN AS \"DISTRIBUTED INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS,\" AND ITIS WITHIN THIS CLASS OF SYSTEMS THAT DECISION-AIDING SYSTEMS FOR NASA TECHNICAL PROJECT MANAGERS WOULD FALL. AS PART OF THIS INNOVATIVE RESEARCH EFFORT, ANALYTICS WILL INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING AN EXPERT SYSTEM-BASED PROJECT MANAGEMENT DECISION AID TO ASSIST NEW NASA TECHNICAL PROJECT MANAGERS IN THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND COMPLEX PROJECTS.",

BY DIRECTING THESE AGENTS MORE SPECIFICALLY TO TUMOR SITES, THEIR EFFECTIVENESS SHOULD BE IMPROVED. THE APPROACH USED TO ACHIEVE THIS IMPROVED SPECIFICITY WILL BE TO LINK THEM TO SYNTHETIC PORPHYRINS THAT ARE KNOWN TO HAVE TUMORLOCALIZING PROPERTIES. PLATINUM COMPLEXES HAVING KNOWN ANTITUMOR ACTIVITY WILL BE CHEMICALLY REACTED WITH SUBSTITUTED TETRAPHENYLPORPHYRIN COMPOUNDS. THE REACTION CONDITIONS WILL ASSURE STABLE BINDING OF THE ACTIVE PT MOIETY TO THE SUBSTITUENT SITES ON THE PORPHYRIN RING RATHER THAN AT THE CENTRAL SITE. IN THISWAY, THE PORPHYRIN THAT ACCUMULATES IN TUMOR TISSUE CAN ACT AS A CARRIER TO THE TUMOR FOR THE ACTIVE PT SPECIES.

THE CURRENT STATE OF THE TECHNOLOGY OF NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF VISCOUS FLUID FLOWS IS SUFFICIENT FOR DEVELOPING ENGINEERING TOOLS FOR FLOW ANALYSIS OF VARIOUS TYPES OF COMPLEX THREE-DIMENSIONAL FLUID FLOWS. OF PARTICULAR INTEREST ARE FLOWS WITH AERODYNAMIC BODIES PERIODICALLY MOVING PAST FIXED STRUCTURES SUCH AS FOUND IN TURBOMACHINE COMPRESSOR AND TURBINE PASSAGES, AND HELICOPTER BLADE/FUSELAGE INTERACTION. A COMPUTER CODE WILL BE DEVELOPED THAT HAS THE CAPABILITY OF ANALYZING FLOWS OVER COMPLEX 3D CONFIGURATIONS USING MULTIPLE ZONE OF MESH AND SOLVER TYPE (NAVIER-STOKES, EULER, POTENTIAL, ETC.). EACH ZONE IS CHOSEN TO MINIMIZE MESH GENERATION DIFFICULTY AND TO UTILIZE THE LEAST EXPENSIVE SOLVER TYPE THAT IS APPROPRIATE IN THAT PART OF THE FLOW FIELD. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PHASE I EFFORT IS TO DEVELOP AND VALIDATE THE ANALYSIS PROCEDURE FOR FLOW THROUGH A ROTATING TURBINE BLADE MOVING PAST STATIONARY BLADES.",

IN ADDITION TO THE DEFINITION OF A COMMON NETWORK QUERY LANGUAGE, SUCH AS FACILITY REQUIRES FEATURES TO SUPPORT THE DECOMPOSITION OF NETWORK QUERIES INTO \"SUBQUERIES\", THE DISTRIBUTION OF SUBQUERIES TO EACH OF THE RESIDENT DBMSS WHICH CONTAIN APPLICABLE DATA, THE COLLECTION OF SUBQUERY RESPONSES, AND AGGREGATION OF SUBQUERY RESPONSES INTO A COMPOSITE QUERY RESPONSE. TO SUPPORT THESE REQUIREMENTS, A \"SCHEMA SERVER\" MUST BE MAINTAINED ON THE LAN WHICH PROVIDES A REPRESENTATION OF THE NETWORK SCHEMS, WHICH IS A AGGREGATE OF ALL LAN-RESIDENT DATABASE SCHEMAS.

A SPECIFIC CONCEPT FOR THE FILTER IS PROPOSED BASED UPON A MACHZEHNDER IMPLEMENTATION OF FILTER. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONCEPT COULD PROVIDE SPECTRAL SELECTION TO EACH DETECTOR IN THE FOCAL PLANE. THE SENSOR CAN THEREFORE BE ADJUSTABLE IN SEGMENTS OF THE FIELD OF VIEW, ENABLING MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS TO BE CARRIED OUT SIMULTANEOUSLY. AN INSTRUMENT BASED UPON SUCH A DEVICE PROVIDES THE FLEXIBILITY DESIRED IN \"SMART\" SENSORS, AND IS EFFECT A PRE-FOCAL PLANE DATA PROCESSOR.

VASR TECHNIQUES INCLUDE TESTING IN BOTH THE SUBRESONANT AND RESONANT FREQUENCY LEVELS WITH ATTENTION ALSO GIVEN TO BEAT VIBRATIONS. PULSE ARC WELDING INCLUDES TESTING BOTH MICRO-PULSE MILLI-PULSE FREQUENCIES AND THE COMBINED POLY-PULSE METHOD. RESEARCH METHODS INCLUDE EMPLOYING THESE DYNAMIC TECHNIQUES IN MAKING A LARGE SERIES OF WELDS. THE RESULTS WILL THEN BE COMPARED OVER AN AGING PERIOD OF UP TO 21 DAYS, USING MICRO HARDNESS TRAVERSES AND TENSILE TESTS.

THIS TECHNOLOGY USES SPECIALLY DESIGNED WATER-SOLUBLE OXYGEN-BINDING MOLECULES AND A MEMBRANE SYSTEM TO EXTRACT FREE MOLECULAR OXYGEN SELECTIVELY FROM THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT, EITHER A GAS OR LIQUID. THE OXYGENATED CARRIER FLUID THEN FLOWS TO AN ELECTROCHEMICAL CELL WHERE ITS OXIDATION STATE IS ALTERED, CAUSING THE OXYGEN TO BE RELEASED AS A GAS. THE CARRIER FLUID'S OXYGEN AFFINITY IS THEN RECIRCULATED TO REPEAT THE CYCLE. AQUANAUTICS' RESEARCH TEAM OF FIVE PH.D. SCIENTISTS IS COMPRISED OF ELECTROCHEMISTS, PHYSICAL AND ORGANIC CHEMISTS AND BIOCHEMISTS. IT IS SUPPLEMENTED VIA RESEARCH RELATIONSHIPS WITH DUKE UNIVERSITY AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS, WHOSE CHEMISTRY DEPARTMENT PROVIDES DESIGN AND SYNTHESIZING CAPABILITY FOR NEW OXYGEN-BINDING COMPOUNDS. THE AQUANAUTICS' PROCESS POTENTIALLY HAS MANY ADVANTAGES OVER CRYOGENIC AND MOLECULAR SIEVE TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING HIGH PURITY (99.5%), LOWER MANUFACTURING AND MAINTENANCE COST, LOWER ENERGY CONSUMPTION, RESISTANCE TO CHEMICAL CONTAMINATION AND THE CAPABILITY TO PRODUCE A PURE NITROGEN BY-PRODUCT.

THE BIOLOGIC-HD CURRENTLY USES A PLATE DIALYZER TO ACTIVELY PUMP BLOOD WHILE DIALYZING THE BLOOD AND A REDY HISORB COLUMN TO REGENERATE DIALYSATE. PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS PROVEN THAT A THICK SORBENT SUSPENSION CAN FLOWTHROUGH THE SCREEN SUPPORTS OF THE PLATE DIALYZER, REPLACING THE REDY COLUMN. A SORBENT SUSPENSION IN THE DIALYSATE CAN PRODUCE HIGHER CLEARANCES OF UREMIC TOXINS ANDCAN USE SORBENTS WITH LIGHT DENSITY AND SMALL PARTICLE SIZE,WHICH ARE DIFFICULT TO PUT INTO COLUMNS, SUCH AS ZEOLITES. THE CURRENT PROPOSAL IS TO FURTHER DEVELOP A SORBENT SUSPENSION THAT WILL EFFECTIVELY REMOVE UREMIC TOXINS, RELEASE APPROPRIATE SUBSTANCES, AND MINIMIZE RELEASE OF POTENTIALLY HARMFUL SUBSTANCES. THIS SORBENT SUSPENSION WILL INCLUDE POWDERED CHARCOAL AND MICROCAPSULES, WHICH INCLUDE CALCIUM-SODIUM-LOADED ZEOLITES AND UREASE. IN VITRO TESTS WILL DEMONSTRATE THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF THE SORBENT SUSPENSION. IF THESE TESTS ARE POSITIVE, AN INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE EXEMPTION (IDE) PROPOSAL WILL BE SUBMITTED TO THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION TO ALLOW CLINICAL TRIALS OF THE SORBENT SUSPENSION IN THE BIOLOGIC-HD SYSTEM.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         EFFECTIVE HEMODIALYSIS REQUIRES A BLOOD FLOW OF 250 TO 300 ML/MINUTE. THE USUAL METHOD FOR OBTAINING THIS BLOOD ISTO PLACE TWO LARGE NEEDLES INTO A FISTULA (ARTERIALIZED VEIN) OR A GRAFT (PTFE CONDUIT BETWEEN ARTERY AND VEIN). BOTH NEEDLES ARE REMOVED AT THE END OF EACH TREATMENT. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO FURTHER DEVELOP AN INDWELLING FISTULA ACCESS DEVICE (IFAD) THAT CAN BE INSERTEDINTO A FISTULA OR GRAFT, LEFT IN PLACE FOR SEVERAL WEEKS OR MONTHS, AND USED FOR NUMEROUS HEMODIALYSIS TREATMENTS. BLOOD ACCESS WOULD THEN BE RAPID, PAINLESS, AND BLOODLESS. THE IFAD WILL BE CONSTRUCTED FROM TWO SIZES OF STAINLESS-STEEL NEEDLE STOCK. A 20-GAUGE NEEDLE WITH POINT IS WELDED INTO THE FRONT OF A 17-GAUGE NEEDLE, NEAR A SIDE HOLE IN THE LARGER NEEDLE (FOR BLOOD REMOVAL OR RETURN). THE SMALL NEEDLE IS INSERTED FIRST INTO THE FISTULA OR GRAFT, AND ROTATION BRINGS THIS NEEDLE THROUGH THE SKIN, WHERE A CAP IS PLACED TO CLOSE IT AND TO STABILIZE THE DEVICE. THE ROTATION ALSO BRINGS THE SIDE HOLE OF THE 17-GAUGE NEEDLE INTO THE FISTULA. ANIMAL TESTS WITH A SIMILAR 16-GAUGE DEVICE HAVE SHOWN THAT THE IFAD CAN BE LEFT IN PLACE FOR UP TO 4 MONTHS WITHOUT CLOTTING, PHLEBITIS, OR INFECTION. THIS IMPRESSIVE BIOCOMPATIBILITY IS DUE TO IMMOBILIZATION OF THE DEVICE AND TO AVOIDING THE TRAUMA OF A NEEDLE POINT WITHIN THE FISTULA. DURING THIS PROJECT, IN VITRO TESTS WILL DETERMINE THE HYDRAULIC RESISTANCE OF THE IFAD. ANIMAL TESTS WILL DETERMINE THE LONGEVITY, BIOCOMPATIBILITY, RESISTANCE TO INFECTION, AND EASE OF REMOVAL OF THE DEVICE. IF THESE TESTS ARE SUCCESSFUL, AN INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE EXEMPTION (IDE) PROPOSAL WILL BE PREPARED FOR SUBMISSION TO THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION FOR HUMAN TESTING OF THE DEVICE.",

THEN THE APPROACH WILL BE EVALUATED BY POSTULATING STUDIES OF TYPICAL AIRCRAFT CONFIGURATIONS. AT THE CONCLUSION OF PHASE I THE NEED FOR ADDICIONAL SIMPLIFICATIONS OF THE ANALYTICAL FORMULATION WILL BE IDENTIFIED; THE SIMPLIFICATIONS WILL BE INCORPORATED DURING PHASE II OF THE PROGRAM.

THE MOST PRESSING NEED IS AUTOMATED SUPPORT FOR \"MANAGEMMENT OF COMPLEXITY.\" IDI'S PREVIOUS WORK WITH COMMERCIAL AND GOVERNMENT CLIENTS HAS HELPED US IDENTIFY THE REQUIREMENTS FOR A WORKSTATION-BASED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT. THE KEY TO REALIZING THE BENEFITS OF THIS AUTOMATION IS TO INTEGRATE THESE TOOLS BY SHARING INFORMATION AND PRESENTING A CONSISTENT AND POWERFUL USER INTERACTION METHOD. THE GOALS OF A SOFTWARE ENGINEERING ENVIRONMENT ARE TO PROVIDE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED PRODUCTIVITY AND PRODUCT QUALITY. THE ENVIRONMENT MUST AUTOMATE MORE LIFE CYCLE TASKS, AND CONTROL THE DEVELOPING PRODUCT WITH BETTER INFORMATION MANAGEMENT. IT MUST ADDRESS THE ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE, WITH CHANGES TO THE RELATIVE DISTRIBUTION OF EFFORT (INCREASE ANALYSIS, DECREASE MAINTENANCE). THE ENVIRONMENT SHOULD SUPPORT THE USE OF MODERN METHODS AND TECHNIQUES SUCH AS REQUIREMENTS AND DESIGN MODELING/SIMULATION (INCLUDING PROTOTYPING), AND PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR EXISTING STANDARDS: ADA (PROGRAMMING), 2167 (DOCUMENTATION). FINALLY, THE WORKSTATION WHICH HOSTSTHE ENVIRONMENT MUST PROVIDE AN \"OPEN, FLEXIBLE, EXTENSIBLE\" ARCHITECTURE. THIS ARCHITECTURE WILL UNIFY AND INTEGRATE EXISTING (STANDALONE) TOOLS, COPE WITH THE EXISTING DIVERSITY OF HARDWARE, AND EVENTUALLY INCORPORATE ALL KNOWLEDGE BASES AND EXPERT SYSTEM TECHNIQUES AS THEY MATURE.",

IN BIOTECHNOLOGY, FOR EXAMPLE, INTERMEDIATE SYNTHESIS PRODUCTS MUST BE IDENTIFIED. RECENT ION BOMBARDMENT DESORPTION MODELS SUGGEST THAT HIGHEST-MOLECULAR-WEIGHT COMPOUNDS WOULDDESORB MOST EFFICIENTLY THROUGH RAPID, MULTIPLE EXCITATIONS NEAR THE MOLECULAR ATTACHMENT SITE. RESONANCE IONIZATION SPECTROSCOPY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DELIVER SPATIALLY CONSTRAINED PRIMARY ION BUNDLES ON TARGET IN THE PICOSECOND RANGE. THE SUCCESSIVE ION ARRIVAL-TIME INTERVALS FOR THIS SOURCE ARE COMMENSURATE WITH SUBPICOSECOND TIMES THEORETICALLY PREDICTED FOR MOLECULAR MOTION AND ENERGY TRANSFER TO THE ATTACHMENT SITE. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE TO: (1) MODIFY A THERMAL ATOMIZATION SOURCE AND ION-EXTRACTION LENS FOR A PRIMARY RESONANCE-IONIZATION BOMBARDMENT SOURCE; (2) MODIFY AN EXISTING TIME-OF-FLIGHT MASS SPECTROMETER FOR HIGHER RESOLUTION; (3) EVALUATE THE TEMPORAL WIDTH OF THE PRIMARY ION PULSE; AND (4) INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY OF EFFICIENT DESORPTION OF VERY HIGH-MOLECULAR-WEIGHT SPECIES. THE POTENTIAL MULTIPLE EXCITATION EFFICIENCY AND TEMPORAL RESOLUTION OF THE PROPOSED SOURCE WOULD SIMULTANEOUSLY PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR DESORPTION OF VERY HIGH-MOLECULAR-WEIGHT MOLECULES AND FOR AN ULTRAHIGH-RESOLUTION, TIME-OF-FLIGHT MASS SPECTROMETER.",

THE IMMEDIATE GOALS ARE TO ASSESS THE TECHNOLOGICAL POSSIBILITIES FOR DESIGNING SUCH A UNIT IN AN ACCEPTABLE SIZE, TO VERIFY THE ADEQUACY OF THE FIVE-CHANNEL TACTILE-AID PROCESSING SCHEME FOR THIS APPLICATION, AND TO GAIN ASSURANCE THAT THE THREE CIRCUITS WILL OPERATE FROM A SINGLE BATTERY SUPPLY WITHOUT ADVERSE INTERACTIONS. THE NEED FOR A COMBINED TACTILE AID/AUDITORY TRAINER HAS BECOME EVIDENT FROM THE FACT THAT MORE THAN ONE-HALF OF THE TACTILE AIDS SOLD TO SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION AS TO HOW THEY CAN BE MADE COMPATIBLE WITH FM SYSTEMS. WHILE THIS CAN BE DONE, IT REQUIRES THAT THE CHILD WEAR TWO BODY-TYPE DEVICES (A TACTILE AID AND A SEPARATE FM TRAINER), WHICH IS INCONVENIENT FOR BOTH THE CHILD AND THE TEACHER. FURTHERMORE, THE AVAILABLE TACTILE AIDS ARE NOT IDEAL FOR THIS APPLICATION. AS TACTILE AIDS BECOME MORE COMMONLY USED AND AS TRAINING TECHNIQUES ADVANCE, THE NEED FOR THIS INTEGRATED SYSTEM WILL CLEARLY INCREASE.",

THESE CHANGES CAN BE MEASURED SPECTROPHOTOMETRICALLY AND WILL BE IMAGED AT THE SURFACE OF THE HYPOTHERMIC PERFUSED KIDNEY WITH THE DEVICE TO BE DEVELOPED IN THIS PROPOSAL. IN PHASE I, RAT KIDNEYS WILL BE PERFUSED UNDER HYPOTERMIC CONDITIONS AND REFLECTANCE SPECTRA OF THE KIDNEY CORTEX RECORDED AT INCREMENTAL PERFUSION PRESSURES. SIMILAR SPECTRA WILL ALSO BE RECORDED FOR CHEMICALLY UNCOUPLED KIDNEYS AND FOR KIDNEYS THAT HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO WARM ISCHEMIA. REDUCTION IN CYTOCHROMES C AND AA3 WILL BE CORRELATED WITH RENAL PERFUSION FLOW, OXYGEN CONSUMPTION, AND PHYSIOLOGIC MEASURES OF RENAL FUNCTION.

SOLUTION OF A TPBV PROBLEM REQUIRES INITIALIZATION OF A FAMILY OF NONLINEAR DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS. HISTORICALLY, THESE INITIALIZATIONS HAVE NECESSITATED ITERATIVE COMPUTATIONS BECAUSE THE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS ARE NOT, IN GENERAL, ANALYTICALLY INTEGRABLE. IT HAS RECENTLY BEEN DEMONSTRATED THAT THE APPROPRIATE INITIALIZATIONS CAN BE PERFORMED BY POLYNOMIAL NETWORKS THAT ARE FITTED, OFF-LINE, TO OPTIMUM TRAJECTORY SIMULATION DATA.

IN THE PRESENCE OF CALCIUM IONS AND THE NEW ELECTROLYTE, SULFUR DIOXIDE WAS REDUCED ON CARBON IN EXPERIMENTAL CELLS TO CALCIUM SULFIDE, NOT CALCIUM DITHIONITE. ONE CERTAIN ADVANTAGE IS THAT TWO EQUIVALENTS ARE OBTAINED PER MOLE OF SULFUR DIOXIDE INSTEAD OF ONE, AS IN THE LI/SO2 PRIMARY CELL. WE PROPOSE TO DETERMINE WHETHER D SIZE PROTOTYPE CALCIUM CELLS WITH SUPERIOR CAPACITY CAN BE CONSTRUCTED. THE CAC12 FILM HAS BEEN BLAMED FOR THE CORROSION AND POLARIZATION OF THE ANODES IN CALCIUM/OXYHALIDE CELLS, SINCE CAC12 IS AN ANION CONDUCTOR, NOT A CATION CONDUCTOR AS IS THE SALT FILM ON LITHIUM ANODES IN LITHIUM CELLS. IF THE SALT FILM ON CALCIUM IN THE NEW ELECTROLYTE IS ALSO CAS, WHICH IS A CATION CONDUCTOR, THEN CALCIUM ANODES MAY DISCHARGE BY THE SAME MECHANISM WHICH ALLOWS LITHIUM ANODES TO DISCHARGE EFFICIENTLY.

WE PROPOSE TO CHANGE THE COMPOSITION OF THE ELECTROLYTE SUCH THAT THE LOW FREEZING POINT IS MAINTAINED, YET ADDING SOLUTES WHICH ARE LIKELY TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY. IN ADDITION, INSOLUBLE MATERIALS WHICH COULD BE INSTRUMENTAL IN INCREASING THE CAPACITY BY ENCOURAGING THE FORMATION OF COMPLEXES SIMILAR TO THE ONE WHICH FORMS ON THE KETJENBLACK NOW USED IN THESE CELLS WILL BE ADDED TO THE CARBON POSITIVE ELECTRODE.

THE GOAL OF THE PHASE I PROGRAM IS TO ESTABLISH THE FEASIBILITY OF EMPLOYING HOLLOW-FIBER MEMBRANES IN CONJUNCTION WITH AFFINITY BINDING FOR THE PURIFICATION OF PROTEINS.

THE STRATEGY IS TO BUILD UPON A CLASS OF ABSORB- ENTS ALREADY DEVELOPED AT BEND RESEARCH THAT EXHIBIT EXCEP- TIONAL STABILITY COMPARED WITH OTHER CARRIESRS. THE MAJOR AREA OF WORK INVOLVES THE SYNTHESIS OF SEVERAL INTERMEDI- ATE DIAMINE CPMPOUNDS VIA NOVEL SYNTHETIC ROUTES.

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED WORK IS TO PROVIDE PHYSICIANS AND OTHERS IN THE FIELD OF PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY WITH AN INEXPENSIVE AND RELIABLE BIOCHEMICAL TEST TO MEASURE PATIENTS' EXPOSURE TO TOBACCO SMOKE. AT PRESENT, A RELIABLE TEST OF THIS TYPE IS NOT AVAILABLE ON A COMMERCIAL BASIS. COTININE, A METABOLITE OF NICOTINE, HAS BEEN SELECTED AS THE PRODUCT TO MEASURE BECAUSE OF ITS CHEMICAL STABILITY, SPECIFICITY AS A MARKER, AND RELATIVELY LONG CIRCULATING HALF-LIFE. HAVING ACCESS TO THIS TEST WILLENHANCE THE PROCESS OF SMOKING ABATEMENT, WHETHER GRADUAL REDUCTION TECHNIQUES (E.G., NICOTINE FADING) OR ABRUPT WITHDRAWAL ARE EMPLOYED, AND THE TEST CAN ALSO BE EMPLOYED TO EMPHASIZE TO PATIENTS THAT TOBACCO SMOKE PRODUCTS ARE ACTUALLY BEING ABSORBED INTO THE SYSTEM. AS A FIRST STEP, AN ENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY (ELISA) WILL BE DEVELOPED TO MEASURE COTININE; IT WILL BE CAPABLE OF ASSESSING QUALITATIVELY THE EXTENT OF TOBACCO SMOKE EXPOSURE IN SALIVA AND/OR URINE. BINAX, INC. INTENDS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A RECENT ADVANCE IN PRODUCING POLYCLONAL CONTININE ANTISERA THAT ALLOWS FOR SELECTIVE REMOVAL OF \"BRIDGE\" ANTIBODIES THAT HAVE, IN THE PAST, PRODUCED HIGH BACKGROUNDS AND DIMINISHED SENSITIVITY. TO ACHIEVE A DETECTION LIMIT OF 10 NG/ML, THE COTININE LEVEL THAT SEPARATES SMOKERS FROM NONSMOKERS, IT IS PROPOSED TO USE A SIMULTANEOUS SOLID-PHASE COMPETITIVE INHIBITION ASSAY IN WHICH BINDING OF ENZYME-LABELED COTININE ANTIBODY TO IMMOBILIZED COTININE IS COMPETITIVELY INHIBITED BY COTININE PRESENT IN THE PATIENT SAMPLE. IN PHASE II, BINAX, INC. PROPOSES TO CARRY OUT A FIELD TRIAL OF THE TEST.",

IT RESEMBLES THE HUMAN AORTIC VALVE, OR THE PORCINE OR BOVINE VALVES, BUT IT IS MADE OF BIOCOMPATIBLE, FATIGUE-RESISTANT CORAFLEX POLYURETHANE. THE VALVE IS DESIGNED TO HAVE MINIMAL MEMBRANE STRESS, SHEARSTRENGTH, AND SUBSEQUENT HEMOLYSIS. THE VALVE HAS BEEN TESTED IN A CARDIAC-PULSE DUPLICATOR AND IN DOGS AND HAS DEMONSTRATED FLOW CHARACTERISTICS SIMILAR TO PORCINE VALVES,WHICH DO NOT REQUIRE ANTICOAGULANTS. IN ADDITION, TO PREVENT VALVE CALCIFICATION, THE PROSTHESIS WILL CONTAIN THE ANTICALCIFICATION AGENT, ETHANEHYDROXYDIPHOSPHONATE (EHDP), IN A SLOW-RELEASE FORM (>30 YEARS EXTRAPOLATED DRUG DELIVERY) AS PART OF BOTH THE LEAFLET STRUCTURE AND THE SUPPORT RING. PHASE 1 OF THE RESEARCH PROGRAM WILL CONSIST OF CONTINUED FATIGUE TESTING OF THE CORAFLEX VALVE ON A SPECIALLY DESIGNED HEART-VALVE-FATIGUE TEST SYSTEM. IT PROVIDES DYNAMIC PRESSURE CHARACTERISTICS SIMILAR TO THOSE EXPERIENCED IN THE ACTUAL OPERATING ENVIRONMENT. PHASE 1 WILL ALSO INVOLVE IN VITRO STUDIES OF EHDP CONTROLLED-RELEASE DRUG DELIVERY FROM THE PROSTHESIS. THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF FATIGUE TESTING AND FORMULATION OF A SUITABLE EHDP CONTROLLED-RELEASE DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEM IN PHASE I WOULD LEAD TO COMPLETE PERFORMANCE AND ANIMAL TESTS IN PHASE II, IN PREPARATION FOR CLINICAL TRIALS.",

LAMINOGRAPHY, ALSO KNOWN AS CONVENTIONAL TOMOGRAPHY, AND CT UTILIZING THIS DETECTION TECHNOLOGY, SHOULD ALLOW LAMINAR PLY IMAGING OF FLAT PLANES. IMAGING IS ACHIEVED BY MOTION OF THE SAMPLE THROUGH A COLLIMATED X-RAY FAN BEAM OR VICE VERSA. DISCRETE DETECTORS PROVIDE DR WITH HIGH CONTRAST RESOLUTION AND A DYNAMIC RANGE OF 16 BITS (65,536 GRAY LEVELS).

ALTHOUGH SOME SPECIES IN THIS GROUP ARE EASILY IDENTIFIED, BETTER GENERAL IDENTIFICATION METHODS ARE NEEDED. IT IS EXPECTED THAT BIOLOG, INC.'S NEW TECHNOLOGY WILL PERMIT IDENTIFICATION OF THE COMMONLY ADDRESSED GRAM-POSITIVE ORGANISMS AS WELL AS RAPID AND ACCURATE IDENTIFICATION OF LESS COMMON GRAM-POSITIVE BACTERIA THAT FREQUENTLY CAUSE SERIOUS INFECTION IN COMPROMISED HOSTS. EXISTING PRODUCTS CANNOT ADEQUATELY IDENTIFY THESE ORGANISMS. BIOLOG, INC. HOLDS TWO PATENTS ON A NEW REDOX METHOD OF TESTING THAT CAN BE DEVELOPED INTO IDENTIFICATION TESTS FOR ALL CLINICALLY IMPORTANT MICROORGANISMS. THESE TESTS WILL IDENTIFY AN ORGANISM BASED ON PATTERNS OF CARBON SOURCE UTILIZATION. THE METHOD EMPLOYS A TETRAZOLIUM DYE TO COLORIMETRICALLY INDICATE CARBON SOURCE OXIDATION. THIS PHASE I STUDY WILL DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING A RAPID AND ACCURATE SPECIATION KIT FOR GRAM-POSITIVE BACTERIA. TWO TASKS ARE INVOLVED: (1) THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SUSPENSION MEDIUM COMPATIBLE WITH THE REDOX CHEMISTRY THAT IS TAILORED TO THIS GROUP OF ORGANISMS, AND (2) A SURVEY OF APPROXIMATELY 200 ORGANIC CHEMICALS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT NEW AND USEFUL SPECIATION TESTS CAN BE FOUND.

ALTHOUGH SAPHENOUS VEIN IS THE PREFERRED SUBSTRATE FOR OCCLUDED SMALL-TO-MEDIUM VEINS, FREQUENTLY IT IS UNAVAILABLE OR UNSUITABLE FOR A GREAT NUMBER OF PATIENTS WHO NEED THIS SURGERY. TWO OF THE PROBLEMS THAT HAVE IMPAIRED THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH A GRAFT ARE POOR CELL ATTACHMENT TO SEEDING GRAFTS AND POOR RETENTION OF CELLS BY GRAFTS WHEN EXPOSED TO IN VITRO AND IN VIVO FLOW CONDITIONS. ALTHOUGH THE USE OF FIBRONECTIN HAS RESULTED IN SOME IMPROVEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THESE PARAMETERS, DEVELOPMENT OF GRAFTS IS STILL FAR FROM COMPLETE. THIS RESEARCH WILL INVOLVE EXPERIMENTS ON MUSSEL ADHESIVE PROTEIN (MAP), WHICH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO INCREASE THE ADHESTION OF CELLS TO GRAFTS IN VITRO AND IN VIVO. MAP HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE AS A CELL-ATTACHMENT FACTOR IN VITRO AND IS BIOCOMPATIBLE WITH CELLS AND TISSUES. EXPERIMENTS ARE DESIGNED TO EXPLORE ATTACHMENT EFFICIENCY OF CELLS TO GRAFTS AND THE RETENTION OF THESE CELLS BY GRAFTS DURING PERFUSION.",

THE SPECIFIC AIM OF THIS PHASE I PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP ONE OR MORE MOABS WITH THESE CHARACTERISTICS FOR STEROID HORMONES. THE RESULTING MOABS SHOULD BE OF CONSIDERABLE VALUE TO INVESTIGATORS WORKING ON MANY DIFFERENT ENDOCRINE RESEARCH PROBLEMS. EXAMPLES OF USE INCLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE SENSITIVE AND SPECIFIC IMMUNOASSAYS, THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANTI-IDIOTYPIC ANTIBODIES USEFUL FOR RECEPTOR ISOLATION, IMMUNO-NEUTRALIZATION OF HORMONAL ACTIVITY, AND IMMUNO-HISTOCHEMICAL LOCALIZATION OF HORMONES. DEVELOPMENT OF DESIRED MOABS WILL BEGIN BY PREPARATION OF DERIVATIVES OF THE STEROIDS AT SELECTED SITES CHOSEN TO MAXIMIZE CHANCES THAT RESULTING ANTIBODIES WILL BE SPECIFIC.THE DERIVATIVES WILL BE CONJUGATED TO KEYHOLE LIMPET HEMOCYANIN, AND IMMUNIZATION WILL BE PERFORMED IN VIVO USINGBALB/CBYJ MICE. FUSION, SCREENING, SELECTION, AND ANALYSIS WILL INVOLVE PROCEDURES TO ENHANCE THE PROBABILITY OF OBTAINING HIGH-AFFINITY MOABS. PHASE II RESEARCH WILL INVOLVE EXTENDING THE APPROACH TO DEVELOP AND CHARACTERIZE SIMILAR MOABS TO OTHER STEROIDS, PEPTIDE HORMONES AND/OR GROWTH FACTORS, AND THEIR RECEPTORS AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE. CHOSEN AND SUBCLONED MOABS WILL THEN BE PRODUCED IN QUANITITY IN VITRO USING A CUSTOMIZED IN-HOUSE BIOREACTOR SYSTEM.",

HBLV APPEARS TO BELONG TO THE GROUP OF HUMAN HERPES VIRUSES AND MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH B LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDERS. EARLY SEROLOGICAL TESTS USING INDIRECT IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE METHODS REVEALED THAT ONLY 4 OF 220 RANDOM, HEALTHY BLOOD DONORS WERE SEROPOSITIVE FOR HBLV ANTIBODIES. MORE RECENT REPORTS STATE THAT THE PREVALENCE OF HBLV INFECTION MAY BE HIGHER. AN ELISA-BASED ASSAY FOR HBLV ANTIBODY DETECTION WOULD FACILITATE FURTHER STUDY OF THE PREVALENCE OF INFECTION WITH THIS VIRUS AND THE RELATION OF INFECTION TO HUMAN DISEASE. HBLV HAS BEEN SEEN TO BE INFECTIOUS IN SEVERAL CELL LINES ASWELL AS IN FRESH B LYMPHOCYTES. IN THIS PROPOSAL, BIOTECH RESEARCH LABORATORIES, INC. PRESENTS ITS PLAN FOR USING HBLVCULTURED IN THE HSB-2 CELL LINE TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING AN ELISA-BASED TEST KIT FOR HBLV ANTIBODY DETECTION.",

DETAILED REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF REAL-TIME EMBEDDED COMPUTER SYSTEMS ARE GENERALLY NOT AVAILABLE FOR MUCH OF THE SYSTEM WHEN THE DESIGN PROCESS MUST BE INITIATED. THE NEED EXIST FOR A MECHANISM TO DEVELOP PARTS OF THE SYSTEM THAT ARE HIGH RISK AND LEAST UNDERSTOOD EARLY IN THE DESIGN PHASE SO THAT BOTH USERS AND DEVELOPERS CAN LEARN AND REFINE THE REQUIREMENTS. THE PROPOSED EFFORT WILL DEVELOP SUCH A MECHANISM. BASED ON HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS, THE PROCEDURE WILL ASSIST BOTH THE SYSTEM DESIGNER AND THE END USER IN THE FORMAL DEFINITION OF SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, BY TIGHTLY COUPLING THE OUTPUT OF THE PROTOTYPING PHASE WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION SOFTWARE, THE PROCEDURE BECOMES A STRONG TOOL FOR USE DURING DEBUG, VERIFICATION TESTING, AND SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM MODIFICATIONS. THE PROPOSED PROCEDURE IS GRAPHICS BASED, AND IS DESIGNED TO BE EASILY TRANSLATED INTO ADA FOR FINAL SYSTEM DESIGN AND CODING. ALTHOUGH INTERACTIVE WITH THE USER, THE PROCEDURE INSURES ADA-BASED STRUCTURE IS RETAINED THROUGHOUT THE USER OF THE PROCEDURE.",

FOR EACH STIMULUS PRESENTATION, A PARAMETRIC MODEL IS ESTIMATED FROM PRESTIMULUS DATA, AND POSTSTIMULUS DATA ARE FILTERED USING THE MODEL. THE MODELING METHOD IS ARECENTLY DEVELOPED CANONICAL VARIATE ANALYSIS (CVA) OF MULTIVARIATE TIME SERIES. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, A VARIETY OF STIMULUS PARADIGMS ARE USED, AND THE PHYSIOLOGICAL VALIDITY OF THE ENHANCED EPS IS EVALUATED. THE ENHANCEMENT TECHNIQUE IS EVALUATED ON DATA ACQUIRED FOR CLINICAL ASSESSMENT AND FOR INTRAOPERATIVE MONITORING, INCLUDING THE SIGNAL-TO-NOISE ENHANCEMENT AND THE REQUIRED COMPUTATION.

A MAJOR FACTOR COMPLICATING PTH-RIA TECHNIQUES IS THE PRESENCE OF MULTIPLE FORMS OF CIRCULATING HORMONE. A PREPONDERANCE OF MIDREGION/CARBOXY-TERMINAL HORMONE FRAGMENTS EXIST IN THE CIRCULATION, BUT THESE FORMS OF THE PEPTIDE ARE WITHOUT BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY AND HAVE PROLONGED HALF-LIVES COMPARED TO BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE INTACT PTH (1-84). THE HETEROGENEITY OF THE HORMONE CONTRIBUTES TO THEHIGH NOISE-TO-SIGNAL RATIO ENCOUNTERED IN MOST PTH-RIAS. THE CYTOCHEMICAL BIOASSAY (CBA) FOR PTH CIRCUMVENTS THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH RIA AND REPRESENTS THE MOST SENSITIVE METHOD CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR MEASURING THIS HORMONE, BUT THIS ASSAY HAS NOT GAINED WIDESPREAD USE BECAUSE IT IS LABOR INTENSIVE, HAS LIMITED SAMPLE THROUGHPUT, AND REQUIRES EXPENSIVE INSTRUMENTATION. PRELIMINARY DATA SUGGEST THAT THIS SENSITIVE ASSAY SYSTEM CAN BE MODIFIED, CREATING THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP A POWERFUL DIAGNOSTIC ASSAY FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES THAT IS FREE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF THE ORIGINAL CBA.",

DETECTION OF THESE FIELDS AND MEASURMENT OF THEIR MAGNITUDE, ORIENTATION, SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION, AND TIME DEPENDENCE WOULD OPEN A NEW AREA OF INVESTIGATION IN SOLAR PLASMA DIAGNOSTIC TECHNIQUES. WE HAVE DEVELOPED A NEW TECHNIQUE FOR REMOTE SENSING THE MAGNITUDE AND ORIENTATION OF MACROSCOPIC ELECTRIC FIELDS HAVING A SUBSTANTIAL COMPONENT IN THE SKY PLANE, USING THE POLARIZATION-DEPENDENCE OF BALMER LINE STARK BROADENING. RESULTS SO FAR SUGGEST A DETECTABLE FIELD POSSIBLY ASSOCIATED WITH RECONNECTION IN AN EXCELLENT SET OF OBSERVATIONS OF A POST-FLARE LOOP. THE PHASE I WORK WE PROPOSE HERE WOULD EXTEND THESE SOLAR OBSERVATIONS TO A LARGER SAMPLE OF SOLAR STRUCTURES, AND TO THE PASCHEN LINES IN THE NEAR IR WHERE THE TECHNIQUE SHOULD BE MORE SENSITIVE. WE ALSO INTEND TO CARRY OUT LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS AT THE MIT TARA MIRROR MACHINE TO FURTHER REFINE AND CALIBRATE THIS TECHNIQUE OF PROBING PLASMA ELECTRIC FIELDS. OUR RESULTS WILL BE COMPARED TO THEORETICAL MODELS OF STATIC AND OSCILLATORY MACROSCOPIC E-FIELDS ASSOCIATED WITH RECONNECTION, PARTICLE ACCELERATION, AND PLASMA WAVES IN SOLAR STRUCTURES.",

THE BASIC TECHNIQUE CENTERS ON THE USES OF THE OPTIMAL CONTROL MODEL (OCM) OF THE HUMAN OPERATOR, AN INFORMATION-PROCESSING MODEL OF SKILLED HUMAN BEHAVIOR WHOSE STRUCTURE AND PARAMETER SET REFLECT THE BASIC HUMAN LIMITATIONS AND COMPONENT SKILLS WHICH DETERMINE TASK PERFORMANCE. WE PROPOSE USING A PARAMETRIC LEARNING MODEL TO SPECIFY THE TIME HISTORY OF MODEL PARAMETERS DURING TRAINING, FOR BOTH INDIVIDUAL SUBJECTS AND NORMAL POPULATIONS. LEARNING DEFICIENCIES ARE DETECTED AND DIAGNOSED BY COMPARING INDIVIDUAL VS. POPULATION PARAMETER TIME HISTORIES. SKILL-DEFICIENT INDIVIDUALS UNDERGO REMEDIAL TRAINING ON TAKS SELECTIVELY TUNED TO AMELIORATE THE SPECIFIC DEFICIT; SUCCESSFUL REMEDIAL TRAINING RETURNS THE INDIVIDUAL TO THE MAIN INSTRUCTIONAL SEQUENCE. WE PROPOSE TO EVALUATE OVERALL PROTOCOL FEASIBILITY VIA FOUR TASKS. WE WILL: 1) EXTEND THE PARAMETRIC LEARNING MODEL TO SUPPORT STATISTICAL DECISION-MAKING; 2) SPECIFY A METHOD FOR DEFICIT DIAGNOSIS AND DESIGN SELECTIVELY-SENSITIVE REMEDIAL TASKS; 3) EVALUATE THE PROTOCOL WITH A BASELINE TASK AND EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM; AND 4) IDENTIFY PROTOCOL DEFICIENCIES AND SPECIFY REQUIREMENTS FOR FOLLOW-ON DEVELOPMENT. A FINAL REPORT WILL SUMMARIZE THE STUDY'S OBJECTIVES, ACHIEVEMENTS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER WORK.",

THREE-BODY OR OTHER SPECIAL TYPES OF INTERACTIONS (BEYOND PRESENT ISOTROPIC TWO-BODY POTENTIALS) ARE NECESSARY FOR SIMULATION STUDIES OF SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSES. LACKING SUCH POTENTIALS, THE RELIABLE SIMULATION OF EPITAXIAL GROWTH IS NOT POSSIBLE. CHEMICAL DYNAMICS CORPORATION PROPOSES TO DEVICE ACCURATE MODELS FOR SEMICONDUCTOR INTERACTIONS AND TO ESTABLISH THE FEASIBILITY OF SIMULATING EPITAXIAL GROWTH. THE POTENTIAL FUNCTION PARAMETERS WILL BE OBTAINED BY FITTING TO A DATA BASE OF ACCURATE AB INITIO AND EXPERIMENTAL INFORMATION. QUANTUM CHEMICAL CALCULATIONS WITH STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS WILL BE USED TO EXPAND THE DATA BASE. THE MONTE CARLO PROCEDURE FOR ADATOM DEPOSITION ON A SUBSTRATE WILL BE EMPLOYED DURING PHASE I. EVALUATION OF THE MODEL FOR A REAL EPITAXIAL SYSTEM AND SIMULATIONS OF EPITAXIAL GROWTH WILL ESTABLISH THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS APPROACH. IN PHASE II, CONTINUED ALGORITHM DEVELOPMENT, INCLUDING THE USE OF STOCHASTIC METHODS, TO REDUCE THE COST OF EPITAXIAL SIMULATION IS PLANNED.

THE FREQUENCY STEPPED APPROACH WILL ALLOW IMPROVEMENTS OVER THE TYPICAL 'SHORT-PULSE' RADAR BY IMPROVING BANDWIDTH CONTROL, IMPEDANCE MISMATCH COMPENSATION, HIGHER OUTPUT POWER, AND COHERENT INTEGRATION AND IMAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES. THE APPROACH WILL DETAIL DESIGN TO THE CIRCUIT LEVEL, SPECIFY TOLERANCES AND SIGNAL CHARACTERISTICS, AND IDENTIFY CRITICAL COMPONENTS OR SUBASSEMBLIES. PERFORMANCE CALCULATIONS WILL INCLUDE SOIL VARIATIONS, LOSSES, SOURCES OF ERROR, AND COMPONENT VARIATIONS. AN IMPROVED GPR WILL BE ABLE TO LOCATE UNDERGROUND UTILITY LINES AND OTHER MANMADE AND NATURALLY OCCURRING OBJECTS (METALLIC AND NON-METALLIC) IN THE GROUND PROFILE TO A DEPTH OF GREATER THAN TWENTY FEET. A-PRIORI KNOWLEDGE OF GROUND CONDITIONS IS ESSENTIAL TO THE SUCCESSFUL AND ECONOMICAL COMPLETION OF CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. KNOWLEDGE OF SUB-SURFACE CONDITIONS POSSIBLY IS THE KEY TO SIGNIFICANT COST REDUCTIONS IN HEAVY CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMS.",

THESE FACTORS HAVE THE SAME BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES AS THE HUMAN TRANSFORMING GROWTH FACTOR-BETA (TGF-BETA). CIF-A AND TGF-BETA APPEAR TO BE THESAME MOLECULE (CIF-A/TGF-BETA), WHILE CIF-B HAS 63 PERCENT SEQUENCE HOMOLOGY. THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST THESE ARE NATURALLY OCCURRING IMMUNOREGULATOR MOLECULES: (1) THESE FACTORS ARE ANTAGONISTS OF INTERLEUKIN-1 (THYMOCYTE PROLIFERATION ASSAY). (2) THESE FACTORS INHIBIT MITOGEN-INDUCED T-CELL AND B-CELL PROLIFERATION. (3) THESE FACTORS ARE POTENT INHIBITORS OF IGM AND IGG PRODUCTION BY PLASMA CELLS. (4) THESE FACTORS ARE ACTIVE AT <1.0NG/ML IN CULTURE. (5) CIF-A/TGF-BETA MRNA IS DETECTED IN MITOGEN-ACTIVATED LYMPHOCYTES AND IS SECRETED BY THESE CELLS. (6) EXOGENOUS FACTOR DOWN-REGULATES THE INTERLEUKIN-2 RECEPTOR. (7) THESEFACTORS EXHIBIT ANTI-INFLAMMATORY ACTIVITY IN VIVO.

SUCH ANTIBODIESWILL BE USEFUL FOR PURIFYING PLANT-DERIVED OLIGO- AND POLYSACCHARIDES, PROVIDING STRUCTURAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE CARBOHYDRATES TO WHICH THE ANTIBODIES BIND, AND DETERMINING THE TISSUE AND CELLULAR DISTRIBUTION OF THE CARBOHYDRATES. THE FEASIBILITY OF GENERATING SUCH MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES WILL BE EXAMINED IN PHASE I. HYBRIDOMA CELL LINES THAT SECRETE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES TO RHAMNOGALACTURONAN-I, A PLANT CELL-WALL DERIVED POLYSACCHARIDE, WILL BE GENERATED. THE COMPLETE STRUCTURE OF THE EPITOPE RECOGNIZED BY AT LEAST ONE OF THE ANTIBODIES WILL BE DETERMINED. THESE STUDIES WILL BE EXTENDED IN PHASE II TO INCLUDE CHARACTERIZATION OF EPITOPES RECOGNIZED BY OTHER ANTI-RHAMNOGALACTURONAN-I ANTIBODIES AND GENERATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES TO ADDITIONAL PLANT-DERIVED OLIGO- AND POLYSACCHARIDES.",

SOME ARCHITECTURES BEING CONSIDERED ARE BETTER SUITED THAN OTHERS TO PERMIT THE UTILIZATION OF \"HIGHER-LEVEL\" KNOWLEDGE TO IMPROVE SPEECH RECOGNITION QUALITY OR EFFICIENCY. ONE SUITABLE ARCHITECTURE IS THE CONTEXT ACTIVATED MEMORY DEVICE (CAMD, PATENT PENDING). THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL INVESTIGATE WAYS IN WHICHTHE DIFFERENT KNOWLEDGE SOURCES OF THIS ARCHITECTURE CAN BE INCORPORATED IN A SPEECH RECOGNITION COMPONENT. ONE PROJECT GOAL IS TO ESTABLISH THE FEASIBILITY OF INCORPORATING A SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM ALREADY UNDER DEVELOPMENT AS A FRONT END TO THE EXISTING DEVICE, OR MORE LIKELY, TO IDENTIFY SYSTEMS IN THE DEVELOPMENT STAGE THAT CAN MAKE USE OF KNOWLEDGE AS IT IS REPRESENTED IN THE CAMD. THIS STUDY WILL DETERMINE HOW MODIFIABLE THOSE SYSTEMS ARE IN TERMS OF THE CONTROL STRATEGIES USED IN CONTINUOUS WORD RECOGNITION. IT IS BELIEVED THAT IF EFFICIENT USE IS TO BE MADE OF THE CAMD (OR SIMILAR AI SYSTEM) KNOWLEDGE SOURCES IN THE SPEECH RECOGNITION PROCESS, THEN STRATEGIES MUST BE PROVIDED TO GUIDE THE APPLICATION OF THIS KNOWLEDGE. BASED ON THE WORK OF NUMEROUS INVESTIGATORS WHO HAVE ALREADY STUDIED THE USE OF PROSODY IN HUMAN SPEECH RECOGNITION, IT IS EXPECTED THAT PROSODIC AIDS TO SPEECH RECOGNITION MAY SERVE THIS PURPOSE. SEVERAL WAYS IN WHICH PROSODIC AIDS MIGHT BE USED TO GUIDE THE APPLICATION OF THE HIGHER LEVEL KNOWLEDGE ARE IDENTIFIED AND PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL ASSESS THEIR USEFULNESS IN SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEMS. THE FEASIBILITY OF USING PROSODIC AIDS IN THIS WAY IS ASSESSED WITH RESPECT TO THE RELIABILITY OF THESE CUES UNDER VARIOUS CONDITIONS RELEVANT TO THE USE OF KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS.

HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE SHORT HALF-LIFE OF NITROGEN-13 (10 MINUTES), THE SYNTHESIS MUST BEPERFORMED IN A RAPID, AUTOMATED MODULE FOR WIDESPREAD UTILIZATION IN THE HOSPITAL ENVIRONMENT. THE NEW ASM MODULE WILL EFFICIENTLY REMOVE THE NITROGEN ISOTOPE FROM THE TARGET OF THE SMALL MEDICAL CYCLOTRON AND PERFORM THE NECESSARY CHEMISTRY TO PRODUCE THE DESIRED NITROGEN-13-LABELED OCTYLAMINE WITHIN 30 MINUTES. THE COMMERCIAL AVAILABILITY OF SUCH AN EFFECTIVE LUNG-IMAGING AGENT, COMBINED WITH THE MANY OTHER INNOVATIONSPRESENTLY OCCURRING IN POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY (PET), COULD GREATLY ENHANCE PET.

GIVEN THE FACTS THAT OYSTER PRODUCTION IN THE UNITED STATES HAS DECLINED GREATLY SINCE 1908 AND THAT NATURAL OYSTERSHELL IS SCARCE AND EXPENSIVE, MOTIVATION FOR USE OF THIS ALTERNATE MATERIAL AS CULTCH INCLUDES ITS CONTINUOUS PRODUCTION, LOW COST, AND THE PHYSICAL PROPERTY TO FRACTURE INTO A LENTICULAR SHAPE SIMILAR TO NATURAL OYSTERSHELL. SINCE ANHYDRITE CALCIUM SULFATE, A CO-PRODUCT OF HYDROGEN FLUORIDE, HAS A POTENTIAL TO LEACH SPECIFIC IONS AND POSSIBLE TRACE METALS, IN VITRO ANALYSES WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE THE MATERIAL'S SUITABILITY FOR PLACEMENT IN THE ESTUARINE ENVIRONMENT. THE TEST MATERIAL'S COMPATIBILITY FOR OYSTER SETTLEMENT AND GROWTH WILL BE ASSESSED THROUGH IN SITU RESEARCH IN AN ESTUARY SUPPORTING SIGNIFICANT OYSTER PRODUCTION.",

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP AND EVALUATE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE ADAPTIVE CONTROL SOFTWARE FOR THE AUTOMATIC REGULATION OF THERAPEUTIC AGENTS IN CLINICAL APPLICATIONS. THE USE OF SUCH SOFTWARE IN EXISTING AND FUTURE AUTOMATIC DRUG DELIVERYDEVICES IS A POTENTIALLY POWERFUL TOOL FOR PHYSIOLOGICAL RESEARCH AND CLINICAL THERAPY. TWO TYPES OF ADAPTIVE CONTROLLERS WILL BE EVALUATED IN THIS PROJECT. ONE IS A MODIFIED VERSION OF THE SELF-TUNING REGULATOR THAT HAS BEEN TESTED IN PHYSIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS. THE OTHER IS A RECENTLY DEVELOPED ADAPTIVE INFERENTIAL CONTROL ALGORITHM WHICH HAS SEVERAL POTENTIAL BENEFITS FOR DRUG CONTROL. BOTH ALGORITHMS WILL BE COMPARATIVELY EVALUATED IN COMPUTER SIMULATIONS AND ON ANESTHETIZED DOGS. THE SIMULATIONS WILL STUDY THE SIMULTANEOUS CONTROL OF MEAN ARTERIAL PRESSURE AND CARDIAC OUTPUT. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS PROJECT STEMS NOT ONLY FROM THE USEFULNESS OF AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM TO CONTROL BLOOD PRESSURE, BUT FROM OTHER EXPECTED DRUG-DELIVERING APPLICATIONS. THIS PROJECT WILL RESULT IN USER-FRIENDLY CONTROL SOFTWARE AND WILL HAVE COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL AS PART OF ADVANCED EQUIPMENT FOR OPERATING ROOMS, INTENSIVE CARE UNITS, AND CHRONIC AMBULATORY DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEMS.",

IN PHASE I, THEY WILL EXAMINE FOUR MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES TO DETERMINE THE OPTIMAL RELATIVE DENSITIES OF EACH ORGANISM UNDER VARIOUS TREATMENTS, INCLUDING MODIFICATIONS OF FEEDING SCHEDULE AND PARTIAL HARVESTS.

        "abstract": "Abstract         THIS PROPOSAL DESCRIBES AN INNOVATIVE CONCEPT FOR ELECTRONIC CAPACITORS THAT ALLOWS ENERGY STORAGE DENSITIES 1,000 TO 100,000 TIMES THOSE OF STATE-OF-THE-ART CAPACITORS. SUCH DENSITIES, USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH MICROELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGIES, WOULD ALLOW COMPLETE POWER SUPPLIES TO BE CONTAINED ON INTEGRATED-CIRCUIT CHIPS. THIS, IN TURN, WOULD ALLOW UNPRECEDENTED FLEXIBILITY AND SAVINGS IN CIRCUIT DESIGN AND LAYOUT BY PERMITTING THE USE OF DISTRIBUTED POWER SUPPLIES AND SELECTIVE REGULATION. WITH THIS INNOVATION, CIRCUIT BOARDS AND LARGE-SCALE INTEGRATED CIRCUITS COULD CARRY THEIR OWN POWER SUPPLIES, THUS FREEING THEM FROM THE PRESENTLY-REQUIRED PROXIMITY TO CENTRAL POWER SUPPLIES AND ALLOWING COMPLETE FREEDOM OF LOCATION. IN FACT, THE CENTRAL POWER SUPPLY WOULD COMPLETELY CEASE TO EXIST FOR MANY APPLICATIONS. PROTOTYPE CAPACITORS THIS EXCITING CONCEPT HAVE ALREADY BEEN PRODUCED IN AQUEOUS TECHNOLOGY, WHICH, OF COURSE, IS NOT CURRENTLY APPLICABLE TO INTEGRATED-CIRCUIT USES. HOWEVER, THE CONCEPT YIELDS TO SOLID-STATE TECHNOLOGY, WHICH CAN BE USED FOR SUCH APPLICATIONS. THE RESEARCH PROGRAM DESCRIBED HERE HAS AS ITS GOAL THE DEMONSTRATION OF THE FEASIBILITY OF USING SOLID-STATE TECHNOLOGY IN THE NEW CONCEPT. SEVERAL CANDIDATE SYSTEMS ARE PROPOSED WHICH HAVETHE POTENTIAL FOR SATISFYING THE REQUIREMENTS, AND THESE ARE TO BE TESTED TO DETERMINE THEIR CHARACTERISTICS. THE RESULT OF THIS PHASE I EFFORT WILL DETERMINE THE DETAILS OF THE PROGRAM TO BE FOLLOWED IN PHASE II FOR THE PRODUCTION OF PROTOTYPES OF TRUE SOLID-STATE CAPACITORS AND CHIPAND IC-SCALE POWER SUPPLIES.",

SPECTROSCOPIC MEASUREMENTS ON SAMPLES HAVE SHOWN AN EMISSION RANGE FROM 500 TO 800 NM AND A LIFETIME OF APPROXIMATELY 10 MICROSEC. THIS DATA SUGGESTS THAT TIYALO(3) WILL BE AN ATTRACTIVE LASER. THE TI:YALO(3) CRYSTALS HAVE NOT BEEN LASED SO FAR AND THIS PERFORMANCE IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE POOR OPTICAL QUALITY OF THE CRYSTALS. THE PRESENT PROPOSAL IS TO SHOW FEASIBILITY OF TI:YALO(3) CRYSTAL GROWTH USING THE HEAT EXCHANGER METHOD (HEM[TM]).

MANY OF THESE SYSTEMS, SUCH AS WIS, USAFE INCOMNET, AND MAC GDSS HAVE IDENTIFIED REQUIREMENTS FOR A MLS/TRUSTED GATEWAY INTERFACE DEVICE TO PROVIDE AUTOMATED INTERCONNECTION TO SYSTEMS AT OTHER SECURITY LEVELS.THE DDN SECURITY ARCHITECTURE HAS IDENTIFIED A SIMILAR REQUIREMENT TO INTERCONNECT SYSTEM SEGMENTS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS SBIR PROGRAM IS TO DEMONSTRATE AN APPROACH TO IMPLEMENTING THIS CAPABILITY ON A COTS HARDWARE BASE, WITH SIGNIFICIANT REDUCTION IN THE SIZE OF THE TCB OVER PREVIOUS APPROACHES. THE APPROACH IS BASED ON THE MODULAR SECURITY CONCEPTS DEVELOPED ON THE RADC MULTINET PROGRAM, WHICH WAS IMPLEMENTED ON A UNIQUE HARDWARE BASE BECAUSE TECHNOLOGY TO SUPPORT THE DESIGN WAS NOT AVAILABLE. RECENT ADVANCES IN MICROPROCESSOR BUS ARCHITECTURE NOW ALLOW THE CONCEPTS TO BE APPLIED TO A MORE COST EFFECTIVE COTS HARDWARE BASE. NEW CHIP LEVEL ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGY WILL BE UTILIZED TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TRUSTED SOFTWARE REQUIRED, USING TECHNIQUES ORIGINALLY PROPOSED FOR SECURE DATA BASE SYSTEMS.",

APPLICATIONS SUCH AS SURVEILLANCE, TRACKING, PROCESS MONITORING, QUALITY CONTROL AND MANY OTHERS, ARE REQUIRING HIGHER AND HIGHER RESOLUTION. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PROCESS THE DATA FROM A HIGH RESOLUTION CAMERA IN REAL TIME. WE PROPOSE TO EXAMINE THE USE OF A RANDOM ACCESS CAMERA, ONE IN WHICH PIXELS ARE INDIVIDUALLY ADDRESSABLE, TO PRODUCE A VARIABLE RESOLUTION CAMERA WHICH WOULD BE CAPABLE OF FINE AND COARSE RESOLUTION IMAGING UNDER SOFTWARE CONTROL. WE WILL INVESTIGATE METHODS FOR RANDOMLY ADDRESSING THE ARRAY OF DETECTORS ELECTRICALLY, AS WELL AS OPTICALLY. A SIMULATION OF THE BEHAVIOR OF SUCH CAMERAS WILL BE MADE TO DETERMINE THE ADVANTAGES OF RANDOM ACCESS TECHNOLOGY OVER STANDARD VIDEO TECHNOLOGY. A RANDOM ACCESS CAMERA OPERATING IN THE VISIBLE TO THE NEAR-INFRARED WAVELENGTH REGION WITH INDIVIDUAL PIXEL ACCESS TIME OF ONE MICROSECOND OR LESS IS A MUCH-NEEDED DEVICE FOR OPTICAL PROCESSOR AND OPTICAL COMPUTING OPERATION.",

EXAMPLES FROM THE CANCER FIELD INCLUDE ANALYSIS OF REPEATED TUMOR MARKER MEASUREMENTS, TUMOR GROWTH CURVE ANALYSIS FOR ANIMAL BIOASSAY, AND CHANGESIN BODY WEIGHT FOR PATIENTS ON CANCER CLINICAL TRIALS. IN THE PAST, ANALYSIS OF SUCH DATA WAS BASED ON STRONG, BUT UNVERIFIABLE, PARAMETRIC ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE DATA-GENERATING PROCESS. RECENTLY, THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL IMPORTANT METHODOLOGICAL ADVANCES THAT ENABLE LONGITUDINAL DATA TO BE ANALYZED BY NONPARAMETRIC AND SEMI-NONPARAMETRIC METHODS. MOREOVER, THESE METHODS REMAIN VALID IN THE PRESENCE OF MISSING DATA AND TIME-VARYING COVARIATES. THE MAIN GOALS OF THIS PHASE I PROPOSAL ARE (1) TO UNIFY THESE METHODOLOGIC ADVANCES BY PROVIDING A SINGLE, SEMI-NONPARAMETRIC (QUASI-LIKELIHOOD) APPROACH THAT CAN BE USED WITH EITHER CONTINUOUS OR CATEGORICAL REPEATED-MEASURESDATA, WITH POSSIBLY MISSING OBSERVATIONS, AND POSSIBLY TIME-VARYING COVARIATES; (2) TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING STATISTICAL SOFTWARE, MEETING COMMERCIAL STANDARDS OF FRIENDLINESS AND RELIABILITY, TO IMPLEMENT THE NEW ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES; AND (3) TO ANALYZE SOME REAL LONGITUDINAL DATA SETS WITH NEWLY DEVELOPED DEMONSTRATION SOFTWARE. THE EXPERIENCE GAINED IN THIS PHASE I ENDEAVOR WILL BE USED DURING PHASE II TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE, COMMERCIALLY VIABLE STATISTICAL PACKAGE FOR LONGITUDINAL DATA ANALYSIS ON MAINFRAME, MINI-, AND MICROCOMPUTERS.",

THE REAL-WORLD VALIDITY OF SUCH RESEARCH IS QUESTIONABLE, MAKING EPIDEMIOLOGICAL FIELD STUDIES NECESSARY IF SUCH DATA ARE TO BE USED EFFECTIVELY INDEVELOPING IMPROVED DIAGNOSTIC AND PREVENTIVE INTERVENTION PROCEDURES. THE LACK OF A TRULY PORTABLE PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY MICROLABORATORY APPEARS TO BE THE MAJOR IMPEDIMENT TO CONDUCTING THESE IMPORTANT FIELD STUDIES. THE IDEAL \"MICROLAB\" WOULD BE A FULLY COMPUTERIZED, ENERGY-EFFICIENT, TRULY PORTABLE VERSION OF THE TRADITIONAL PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY LABORATORY. THIS MEANS THAT SUCH A MICROLAB WOULD BE CAPABLE OF STIMULUS GENERATION, MEASUREMENT OF MULTIPLE PARAMETERS OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL REACTIVITY TO STRESS, STRESS REDUCTION, PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL DATA, AND TRANSMISSION OF DIGITIZED DATA TO MAINFRAME COMPUTERS IN FILE-COMPATIBLE FORMATS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING SUCH A MICROLAB FOR USE IN FIELD STUDIES OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL REACTIVITY TO STRESS. VIDEOTAPE FEEDBACK HAS BEEN USED AS AN EFFECTIVE TECHNIQUE IN THERAPY FOR OVER 25 YEARS. IT IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE JOB SEEKERS' WORKSHOP (JSW), AN APPROACH TO HELPING DRUG TREATMENT CLIENTS BECOME EMPLOYED THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN THREE CONTROLLED STUDIES. THEJSW DISSEMINATION PROJECT HAS SUCCESFULLY EMPLOYED VIDEO FEEDBACK AS A TOOL FOR TRAINING JSW GROUP LEADERS IN DRUG TREATMENT PROGRAMS. THE PURPOSE OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP AN EFFECTIVE PROGRAM FOR TRAINING DRUG TREATMENT PROFESSIONALS TO USE VIDEO FEEDBACK AS A TECHNIQUE FOR HELPING THEIR CLIENTS ACHIEVE TREATMENT GOALS. THE COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONWILL BE A FEE-FOR-SERVICE TRAINING PROGRAM WHICH WILL HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO BE ACCEPTABLE TO PARTICIPANTS AND EFFECTIVE IN DEVELOPING SKILLS IN THE USE OF VIDEO FEEDBACK AS A TREATMENT TECHNIQUE FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSERS. IN PHASE I, A PILOT TRAINING DESIGN AND MATERIALS WILL BE PILOT-TESTED, EVALUATED, MODIFIED, RE-TESTED, AND RE-EVALUATED.

NONE APPEAR POWERFUL ENOUGH TO CAPTURE THE DIVERSE TYPES OF KNOWLEDGE THAT PEOPLE POSSESS NOR DO THEY APPEAR FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THE ACQUISITION OF KNOWLEDGE. THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL DEVELOP A KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION SCHEME THAT INTEGRATES THREE MAJOR FRAMEWORKS: SCHEMAS/FRAMES, PRODUCTION RULES AND MENTAL MODELS. IT IS ARGUED THAT THESE INDIVIDUAL FRAMEWORKS CAN PERFORM COMPLEMENTARY FUNCTIONS AS PART OF AN INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK: SCHEMAS/FRAMESARE MOST USEFUL AT CAPTURING THE GENERAL STRUCTURE OF KNOWLEDGE, PRODUCTION RULES BEST CAPTURE SITUATION-SPECIFIC PROCEDURES AND ACTIONS AND MENTAL MODELS SERVE AS MECHANISMS WHICH CAN EXPLAIN THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS OF GOALS, PLANS, AND ACTIONS. IT IS HYPOTHESIZED THAT THIS INTEGRATED REPRESENTATION FRAMEWORK CAN SUPPORT KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION PRIMARILY THROUGH THE USE OF ABSTRACT KNOWLEDGE WHICH REPRESENTS GENERALIZED EXPECTANCIES OF A DOMAIN AND MENTAL MODELS WHICH LINK THAT KNOWLEDGE TO THE SPECIFIC SITUATION. THIS HYPOTHESIS WILL BE TESTED ON A SMALL SCALE AI SYSTEM. THE PROJECT TEAM CONTRIBUTES EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN AI (LEDDO, ABELSON, COHEN, CHINNIS, THOMPSON, AND MCINTYRE) AND EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN PSYCHOLOGY AND THEORIES OF KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION (LEDDO, ABELSON, COHEN, AND CHINNIS).",

GROWING METROPOLITAN AREAS ARE PLACING NEW DEMANDS ON EXISTING WATERRESOURCES, REQUIRING THAT AGRICULTURAL IRRIGATION SYSTEMS BEAS EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE. TO HELP OPTIMIZE THE FLOW DELIVERY OF IRRIGATION SYSTEMS, A COST-EFFECTIVE, ACCURATE FLOW-MEASURING SLUICE GATE FOR CANALSIDE TURNOUT METERING AND CONTROL IS PROPOSED. THIS PROJECT WILL STUDY THE FEASIBILITY OF A NEW GATE DESIGN WHICH SIMULTANEOUSLY MEASURES AND REGULATES FLOW. THE APPROACH IS CHARACTERIZED BY UNIQUE FLOW-SHAPING AND NON-INVASIVE VELOCITY MEASUREMENTTECHNIQUES COMBINED WITH A MICROPROCESSOR-BASED CORRECTION ALGORITHM. THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATIONS OF FLOW SHAPING ALTERNATIVES AND VELOCITY TRANSDUCER ARRANGEMENTS WILL BE PERFORMED. BASED ON THESE RESULTS, A MODEL WILL BE DESIGNED, CONSTRUCTED AND TESTED IN A FLOW LOOP OVER A RANGE OF HYDRAULICALLY RELEVANT CONDITIONS. THE RESEARCH WILL SHOW THE RANGE OVER WHICH THE GATE POSITION AND THE VELOCITY OF A SPECIFIC REGION IN THE FLOW PATH WILL CONSTITUTE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION FROM WHICH TO INFER TOTAL FLOW. THE RESULTS OF THIS WORK WILL FORM THE BASIS FOR PHASE II AND PHASE III BY DEFINING THE DESIGN APPROACH FOR A PROTOTYPE.",

(DSI) PROPOSES TO BUILD AND DEMONSTRATE IN PHASE I SUCH A DEVICE IN THE FORM OF AN EXPANDING, NESTED SET OF 6\" DIAMETER 4\" LONG CYLINDERS. UPON DEPLOYMENT AND ACTIVATION BY A SALT WATER SWITCH AND ELECTRONIC TIMER, AN INITIAL EXPANSION OF THE NESTED CYLINDERS TAKES PLACE TO COMPENSATE FOR THE PAYLOAD WEIGHT. FROM THEN ON A MICROPROCESSOR AND PRESSURE-SENSOR-CONTROLLED STEPPING MOTOR IS USED TO MICRO ADJUST CYLINDER EXPANSION TO CAUSE THE DEVICE TO CHANGE BUOYANCY, THUS MAINTAINING DEPTH AT THE PRESET LEVEL. THE BUOYANCY DEVICE USES LITTLE ELECTRIC POWER, CONTAINS NO HAZARDOUS DEVICES AND HAS A VERY LOW PROJECTED UNIT COST. IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT DSI OFFERS A COMPLETELY FUNCTIONAL UNIT AS A PHASE I DELIVERABLE. IN PHASE II PRODUCTION PROTOTYPES AND UNITS FOR NAVY TESTING AND INITIAL DEPLOYMENT ARE OFFERED.",

THE FEASIBILITY AND APPLICABILITY OF THE DEVELOPED ONE-G MODELING TECHNIQUES WILL BE FURTHER STRENGTHENED BY A PARALLEL INVESTIGATION OF POTENTIAL MEANS FOR ARTIFICAL MODIFICATION OF MATERIAL PROPERTIES, SUPPORTING ANALYTICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES, AND IMPROVED MONITORING TECHNIQUES. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE RESULTS OF PHASE I PROGRAM WILL ESTABLISH COST-EFFECTIVE AND TECHNICALLY SOUND ONE-G MODELING CONCEPTS (AND COMPLEMENTARY SUPPORTING TECHNIQUES) TO SIMULATE NONNUCLEAR WEAPONS EFFECTS FOR A WIDE RANGE OF CONDITIONS.

THESE DEVICES CAN BE SUBJECT TO MICROMINEATURIZATION, AND INTEGRATED INTO CIRCUITS CONTAINING, ON A SINGLE CHIP, ALL CALIBRATION, ANALYSIS AND READOUT FUNCTIONS. THE PROBLEM WITH PRESENT SENSORS OF CONFIGURATION CATALYTIC METAL/SIO2/SI IS THEIR LACK OF SPECIFICITY AND LONG TERM INSTABILITY. WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE NEW STRUCTURES WHERE AN INSERTION COMPOUND IS INTERPOSED BETWEEN THE METAL AND THE SIO2. THE INSERTION COMPOUND IS CHOSEN TO BE SELECTIVE OF MOLECULE OR ATOM SIZE OR STRUCTURE. THE INSERTION LAYERS OF INTEREST ALSO UNDERGO A CHANGE IN ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY ON INSERTION OF THE SPECIES TO BE SENSED OR ITS BIPRODUCT INTO ITS CRYSTALLINE LATTICE. THESE REACTIONS ARE HIGHLY REVERSIBLE. THE RESULT IS A CHANGE IN THE CAPACITANCE OF THE METAL-INSULATOR-SEMICONDUCTOR STRUCTURE, WHICH IS ULTIMATELY REALIZED AS A CHANGE IN SOURCE-DRAIN CURRENT IN A FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTOR. IN PHASE I, IT IS PROPOSED TO SURVEY A VARIETY OF CATALYTIC METAL/INSERTION COMPOUND BILAYERS IN SIMPLE MIS DIODE STRUCTURES FOR CHEMICAL SENSITIVITY WITH IMPROVED SELECTIVITY, REVERSIBILITY AND STABILITY COMPARED TO PRESENT TECHNOLOGY. PHASE II WILL BE EMPLOYED TO STUDY THE FABRICATION OF DIODE ARRAYS AND THE USE OF PATTERN RECOGNITION LOGIC TO INTERPRET ARRAY RESPONSE FOR ANALYSIS OF GASEOUS MIXTURES.",

WING ROCK IS A SELF-INDUCED, LIMIT-CYCLE OSCILLATION IN ROLL, SOMETIMES ACCOMPANIED BY COUPLED OSCILLATIONS IN YAW, THAT OCCURS NEAR THE STALL ANGLE OF ATTACK. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO THOROUGHLYINVESTIGATE THE WING-ROCK CHARACTERISTICS OF ONE MODERN FIGHTER. THE RESEARCH PLAN WILL ANALYZE AND CORRELATE FLIGHT TIME HISTORIES, THE CORRESPONDING AERODYNAMIC DATA BASE, RESULTS FROM BASIC FLUID MECHANICS EXPERIMENTS INCLUDING WATER-TUNNEL FLOW VISUALIZATION STUDIES OF A MODEL PERFORMING A WING-ROCK MOTION, AND A 6-DOF STUDY TO ASSESS THE IMPORTANCE OF SPECIFIC AERODYNAMIC PARAMETERS. SUCCESS IN THE ANALYSIS OF ONE AIRCRAFT WILL PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EVALUATE OTHER MODERN AIRCRAFT AND, ALONG WITH ONGOING BASIC RESEARCH IN WING-ROCK FLOW PHENOMENA, WILL PROVIDE THE METHODOLOGY FOR PREDICTING AND AVOIDING WING ROCK IN THE DESIGN PHASES OF NEW AIRCRAFT OR IMPROVING EXISTING AIRCRAFT, EITHER THROUGH AERODYNAMIC MEANS OR IMPROVED CONTROL SYSTEMS.

A UNIQUE MAGNETODYNAMIC MODEL FOR AXISYMMETRIC GEOMETRY HAS BEEN DEVELOPED BY ELECTROIMPACT, INC. AND IS CAPABLE OF ACCURATELY PREDICTING THE RESULTING FIELD STRENGTHS. THE OVERALL GEOMETRY CAN BE FLEXIBLY ARRANGED AND ALTERED SINCE THE MODEL EMPLOYS A GENERALIZED SOLUTION FOR THE MUTUAL COUPLING OF CONCENTRIC CURRENT LOOPS. THE MODEL WILL BE SUPPLIED WITH CONVENIENT MENU DRIVEN INTERFACE FOR PARAMETER AND GEOMETRY CHANGES, AND SUPPLIED FOR USE BY THE NAVY. MODEL VERIFICATION TESTING WILL BE PERFORMED WITH EQUIPMENT PRESENTLY IN HOUSE. AFTER VERIFICATION TESTING THE MODEL WILL BE RUN FOR A RANGE OF PARAMETERS SPECIFIED BY THE SPONSORS SO THAT THE FINAL REPORT SERVES AS A CONVENIENT LAUNCHER DESIGN REFERENCE.",

IN A PRIOR EPA SBIR PROGRAM (NOW IN PHASE II) ELECTROCHIMICA CORP. HAS DEMONSTRATED VERY SUCCESSFUL ELECTROCHEMICAL OZONE GENERATION METHODS FROM A VARIETY OF ELECTROLYTES OBTAINING HIGHER EFFICIENCIES AND OZONE CONCENTRATION LEVELS. PLATINUM ANODES HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN THE MATERIAL OF CHOICE. IT WAS DEMONSTRATED THAT WITH CERTAIN ELECTROLYTES LEAD DIOXIDE (PBO2) COATED ANODES CAN BE EMPLOYED AS A LOW COST SUBSTITUTE. EXTENDED STUDY RUNS HAVE SHOWN, HOWEVER, THAT EXTENSIVE CRACKING AND NON-ADHERENCE IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM. THIS BECOMES AN IMPORTANT AREA AFFECTING THE OUTLOOK FOR ELECTROCHEMICAL OZONE GENERATION. A NEW APPROACH IS PROPOSED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUBSTRATE MATERIALS AND PBO2 ANODES WITH LONG OPERATING LIVES AS A BASIS FOR LOW COST ELECTRO-CHEMICAL OZONE GENERATORS FOR DRINKING WATER TREATMENT.",

THE EDA PULSE TO DIGITAL CONVERTER SHALL UTILIZE A SIMPLE METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE FREQUENCIES OF EACH OF 30 INPUT PULSE TRAIN CHANNELS. HOWEVER, THE UNIQUENESS OF THE EDA APPROACH OVER EXISTING INSTRUMENTATION TECHNOLOGY IS THAT THE EDA DIGITAL OUTPUT IS IN REAL TIME, WITH UP TO 200 MEASUREMENTS PER SECOND FOR EACH OF 30 PULSE DATA CHANNELS. LIKEWISE, EACH DATA OUTPUT IS ALSO UPDATED AT A RATE UP TO 200 TIMES PER SECOND. ALL OF THIS CAPABILITY CAN BE PACKAGED IN A SINGLE RACK MOUNTED INSTRUMENTATION ENCLOSURE UTILIZING STANDARD COMPONENTS AND CIRCUIT CARD TECHNIQUES. EDA PROPOSES TO DEMONSTRATE THIS CONCEPT BY DESIGNING AND BUILDING A FULLY EXPANDABLE TWO CHANNEL BREADBOARD MODEL THEN TESTING AND DEMONSTRATING ITS PERFORMANCE.",

THESE FILTERS MUST HAVE HIGH FLEXURE STRENGTH DURING REVERSE FLOW CLEANING. CERAMIC COATINGS FORTHE FIBERS PROMISE TO IMPROVE THE STRENGTH AND CORROSION RESISTANCE OF FILTER FIBERS. THE PLANNED WORK IS TO DEVELOPHIGH PERFORMANCE CERAMIC COATINGS BASED ON FLAKE PARTICLES. THE FLAKES ADHERE TO THE SURFACE OF FIBERS AND SHEETS TO PROVIDE MECHANICAL AND CHEMICAL PROTECTION. THESE CERAMIC FLAKES ARE MADE IN A VACUUM-PLASMA PROCESS, USING A WIDE RANGE OF MATERIALS. RELEASE COATINGS ALLOW VERY THIN FILMS OF CERAMICS TO BE COLLECTED AND SEPARATED INTO BULK PARTICLES WITH A FLAT ASPECT RATIO. PRELIMINARY STUDIES USING MICROFLAKES ON FIBERGLASS WEAVES HAVE SHOWN PROMISING RESULTS. IT IS PROJECTED THAT THE CURRENT COATING WILL EXTEND THE TEMPERATURE AND CORROSION RESISTANCE OF CERAMIC FIBER FILTERS BY PROVIDING A CHEMICAL AND ANTIFRICTION LAYERTHAT IS STRONG AND ADHERENT.",

AS A HEAT RECOVERY SOIL INCINERATOR, IT HAS THE ADVANTAGES OF REDUCED FUEL DEMAND AND LOW COMBUSTION GAS PRODUCT (REDUCING AIR POLLUTION CONTROL NEEDS FOR THE INCINERATOR). THE CCSSHT UNIT IS A SINGLE VESSEL ROTATING KILN THAT (1) PREHEATS ORE, (2) RETORTS THE ORE, (3) GENERATES PROCESS HEAT FROM THE COKE COMBUSTION, (4) CLEANS THE COKE FROM THE SAND, (5) RECOVERS THE HEAT FROM THE CLEAN SAND, AND (6) COOLS THE OIL VAPOR TO AVOID OIL COKING. THESE SIX FUNCTIONS, ALL REGULATED BY THE KILN AND STREAM FLOWRATES, PROVIDE A SIMPLE, EFFICIENT, AND LOW COST PROCESS. BESIDES PRODUCING CLEAN COOL ASH, THE SYSTEM IS ALSO ECOLOGICALLY ATTRACTIVE FOR USE WITH CARBONATE ORES BECAUSE IT GENERATES LESS ALKALINE ASH THAN OTHER PROCESSES--THE WESTERN U.S. OILSHALES CONTAIN NEARLY HALF CARBONATE MINERALS. BASED ON ROTARY FLUIDIZATION, THE CCSSHT RETORT IS EXPECTED TO OPERATE NEARLY AS EFFECTIVELY AS GAS FLUIDIZATION. OIL RECOVERY IS EXPECTED TO EXCEED THAT OF ASH RECYCLING SYSTEMSBY MORE THAN 20%. IT ENABLES HIGH EFFICIENCY HEAT RECOVERY FROM ASH IN A NEW APPROACH THAT AVOIDS THE NEED OF CAPITAL INTENSIVE BOILERS AND POWER GENERATORS. THIS PHASE I STUDY WILL (1) CONSTRUCT A BATCH REACTOR (2 TO 8-LB SAMPLE SIZE), WHICH WILL PROCESS AN ELEMENT OF ORE THROUGH THE STAGES OF HEAT-UP, RETORTING, COKE COMBUSTION, AND COOL-DOWN, THUS SIMULATING THE CCSSHT CONTINUOUS-PROCESS UNIT; (2) INVESTIGATE CONDITIONS CONTRIBUTING TO HIGH OIL YIELD; (3) INVESTIGATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CCSSHT CONCEPTWITH A VARIETY OF ORES; AND (4) GENERATE HEAT TRANSFER DATA FOR THE DESIGN OF A PROCESS DEVELOPMENT UNIT. DURING PHASE II THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CCSSHT CONTINUOUS-FLOW RETORT WILLBE DEMONSTRATED IN A 1 TO 5-TON/DAY PROCESS DEVELOPMENT UNIT.",

TWO TYPES OF SUCH SYSTEMS ARE POSSIBLE. THE SIMPLER IS DESIGNED FOR TWO-WAY TRANSMISSION OF AN IMAGE, THE MORE DIFFICULT IS DESIGN FOR ONE-WAY TRANSMISSION OF AN IMAGE. THE SUCCESSFUL OPERATION OF BOTH DEVICES DEPENDS IN PART ON THE CHOICE OF CONJUGATE MATERIAL AND THE TYPE OF NONLINEAR INTERACTION EMPLOYED. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ONE-WAY DEVICE IS ALSO UNIQUELY DEPENDENT ON THE DESIGN OF CONVENTIONAL IMAGING OPTICS AND THE SPATIAL BANDWIDTH OF THE TRANSMITTED INFORMATION.

PROPOSED TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF APPLYING ITS NEW INNOVATIVE HAPTEN TECHNOLOGY TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF IMMUNORECEPTORS FOR DETECTION AND ASSAY OF BIOLOGICAL TOXINS. THE NEW HAPTEN RECEPTOR TECHNOLOGY OVERCOMES PREVIOUS SCIENTIFIC LIMITATIONS AND TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES IN DEVELOPING IMMUNOASSAYS FOR HIGHLYTOXIC, LOW MOLECULAR WEIGHT PROTEIN TOXINS. TO DATE, THE TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN USED TO DEVELOP TESTS FOR THE TOXIC CHEMICALS DIOXIN, POLY CHLORINATED BIPHENYLS AND ETHYLENE DIBROMIDE WITH SENSITIVITIES OF 10 PARTS PER TRILLION. IMMUNOASSAYS MAY BE ENGINEERED TO DEVELOP TESTS WHICH ARE HIGHLY SPECIFIC FOR A PARTICULAR TOXIN, OR FOR A FAMILY OF CHEMICALLY RELATED TOXINS, OR FOR A PARTICULAR TOXIN AND ITS METABOLITES AND ANALOGS. TETRODOTOXIN WILL BE USED AS A MODEL BIOLOGICAL TOXIN IN PHASE I. THE IMMUNORECEPTORS FOR TETRODOTOXIN WILL BE ADAPTED TO THE COMPANY'S EZ-SCREEN WHICH IS A LOW COST, COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL FIELD TEST THAT CAN DETECT TOXIC CHEMICALS IN THE PARTS PER TRILLION RANGE WITHOUT INSTRUMENTATION. A COLOR CHANGE RESULTS IN 3 TO 5 MINUTES THAT CAN BE EASILY INTERPRETED BY A RELATIVELY UNSKILLED WORKER. SUCCESS IN PHASE I WILL INDICATE THAT TESTS CAN BE QUICKLY DEVELOPED IN PHASE II FOR 15 OR MORE BIOLOGICAL TOXINS.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         EXISTING WATER TREATMENT PLANTS ARE NOT VERY EFFECTIVE FOR THE REMOVAL OF A GROWING LIST OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS THAT POLLUTE OUR WATERS. ONE TREATMENT TECHNIQUE THAT IS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE FOR ORGANIC REMOVAL IS ADSORPTION ON GRANULAR ACTIVATED CARBON (GAC). COST HAS BEEN A MAJOR OBSTACLE TO EXPANDING THE USE OF GAC TREATMENT AND ADSORPTION SYSTEMS WHICH MUST BE OPTIMIZED IF THEY ARE TO PROVIDE COST EFFECTIVE MUNICIPAL WATER TREATMENT. ONE OF THE PROCESS COST FACTORS HAVING THE GREATEST POTENTIAL FOR SAVINGS IS THE LOSS OF GRANULAR ACTIVATED CARBON. MAKE-UP CARBON ALONEACCOUNTS FOR 30%-50% OF THE TOTAL ANNUAL COST OF ADSORPTION SYSTEMS. AS POINTED OUT BY OTHERS, THIS CAN BE REDUCED BY OPTIMIZING THE ADSORPTION STEP AND REDUCING THE FREQUENCY OF REGENERATION. HOWEVER, A GREATER POTENTIAL FOR SAVINGS APPEARS IN A REDUCTION IN CARBON LOSSES: (1) DURING THE THERMAL REGENERATION PROCESS (2) CREATED DURING THE SLURRY TRANSPORT OF GAC FROM THE ADSORBER TO THE REGENERATION FURNACE AND RETURN. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE GREATEST REDUCTION IN THE COST OF GAC TREATMENT EMPHASIS MUST BE PLACEDON THEOSE COMPONENTS OFTHE TREATMENT PROCESS THAT (1) ARE COMMON TO ALL GAC SYSTEM DESIGNS, (2) CONSTITUTE THE GREATEST PORTION OF THE COST, AND (3) CANNOT BE EASILY CHANGED ONCE THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN BUILT. THES CRITERIA SUGGEST THAT STUDIES BE DIRECTED TO- WARD OPTIMIZING THE DESIGN OF CARBON TRANSPORT SYSTEMS. THE OPPOSED RESEARCH IN PHASE I WILL DEVELOP HEAD LOSS CURV-VES AND EQUATIONS FOR THE SLURRY TRANSPORT OF DIFFERENT TYPES AND SIZES OF GRANULAR ACTIVATED COARBON AS A FUNCTION OF PIPE SIZE, VELOCITY AND CARBON CONCENTRATIONS. THIS IN- FORMATION IS NEEDED TO REPLACE THE ERRONEOUS DATA PREVIOUSLYDISSEMINATED AND WILL GREATLY IMPROVE THE DESIGN OF CARBON TRANSPORT SYSTEMS. THE HEAD LOSS CURVES AND EQUATIONS DEVELOPED IN PHASE I FIND IMMEDIATE APPLICATION IN THE DESIGN OF CARBON TRANSPORTSYSTEMS TO REPLACE THE ERRONEOUS DATA PRESENTLY AVAILABLE.",

THE WIDE FLUORESCENCE BANDWIDTH 800-1200 NM OF THIS MATERIAL MAKES IT A PROMISING CANDIDATE FOR NASA SPACE APPLICATION, AS AN OPTICAL PUMPING SOURCE FOR HE3 & HE4 ATOMS USED IN SPACE MAGNETOMETER.

THE SHORT CAVITY NOT ONLY SUPPORTS MULTIPLE CAVITYROUND TRIPS DURING THE SHORT TIME IN WHICH THE POPULATION IS INVERTED BUT ALSO MAKES THE SPACING BETWEEN ADJACENT LONGITUDINAL MODES VERY LARGE. THIS RESULTS IN AN EXTREME REDUCTION OF THE AMPLIFIED SPONTANEOUS EMISSION, SINGLE MODE OPERATION OF THE SYSTEM AND GREAT STABILITY IN THE FREQUENCY OUTPUT.

ADVANCED CONTROL SYSTEMS MUST MONITOR THESE CHANGES WITH APPROPRIATE SENSORS AND PROVIDE A MEANS VIA AN INTELLIGENT PROCESSOR OF ADJUSTING THE PROCESS TO OBTAIN LESS PRODUCT VARIABILITY AND DESIRED PROPERTIES. CARBONIZATION IS A KEY PROCESS STEP USED IN C/C MANUFACTURING. AN INHERENT FEATURE OF PITCH MATRIX PRECURSORS IS MESOPHASE FORMATION, WHICH IS A DISPERSED PHASED FORMED BY THE CHEMICAL REACTION OF SELECT COMPONENTS IN THE PITCH. MESOPHASE FORMATION AND COALESCENCE ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE FORMATION OF GRAPHITIC MATRIX MICROSTRUCTURE. THUS, IMPROVED CONTROL OF THIS STEP MAY LEAD TO INCREASED COMPOSITE PERFORMANCE AND DECREASED VARIABILITY. GAS EVOLUTION, DUE TO CHEMICAL REACTION, ALSO OCCURS DURING THE CARBONIZATION PROCESS.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH AT FMI INDICATES THAT CERAMIC MATRICES CAN BE INTRODUCED INTO A FIBROUS PREFORM USING SIMILAR PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY TO CARBON-CARBON. VARIOUS PRE-CERAMIC POLYMERS EXIST WHICH YIELD SILICON CARBIDE UPON PYROLYSIS. SILICON CARBIDE IS OUTSTANDING IN TERMS OF THERMAL SHOCK RESISTANCE WHILE THE OXIDATION RESISTANCE AT THE SPECIFIC TEMPERATURE RANGE (2500 DEG F - 4000 DEG F) IS ADEQUATE. THE PURPOSE OF THE PROPOSED PROGRAM IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE DEGREE OF OXIDATION RESISTANCE ACHIEVED IN A CARBON FIBER/CERAMIC MATRIX COMPOSITE AT TEMPERATURES UP TO 4000 DEG F FOR USE ON GAS TURBINE COMPONENTS. THIS MATERIAL, BECAUSE OF THE HIGH STRENGTH, LIGHTWEIGHT AND OXIDATION RESISTANCE, COULD FIND A WIDE RANGE OF APPLICATIONS ON ROCKET MOTORS, SPACE VEHICLES, OR FUTURE GAS TURBINE ENGINES.",

EXISTING NEAR-FIELD MEASUREMENT FACILITIES REQUIRE PRECISE POSITIONING SYSTEMS FOR THE PROBE ANTENNA AND AS A CONSEQUENCE ARE EXPENSIVE AND RISKY. A POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENT TO NEAR-FIELD MEASUREMENT IMPLEMENTATION IS A SYSTEM THAT USES A FOUCAULT PENDULUM AS THE SCANNER WITH A PROBE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PENDULUM'S ARM SWINGING ABOVE THE ANTENNA UNDER TEST (AUT). WE PROPOSE TO DESIGN A NEAR-FIELD MEASUREMENT SYSTEM BUILT AROUND THIS CONCEPT, AND THIS PROPOSAL CONTAINS OUR APPROACH TO SUCH A DESIGN. WE PRESENT THE THEORY OF SCANNING OVER ARBITRARY EXTERNAL SPHERES AS WELL AS SAMPLING CRITERIA, FILTERING, AND OTHER NECESSARY SIGNAL PROCESSING TECHNIQUES APPLIED TO THE MEASURED NEARFIELD DATA. WE ALSO CONSIDER THE SOURCES OF ERRORS PRODUCED IN SUCH A MEASUREMENT SYSTEM AS WELL AS PRESENT THE EQUATIONS DESCRIBING THEIR FUNCTIONAL BEHAVIOR. ADDITIONALLY, WE ADDRESS SUCH ISSUES AS BANDWIDTH, DYNAMIC RANGE, AND A/D CONVERSION SPEED. IN ORDER TO TEST THE PHYSICAL CREDIBILITY OF THE PENDULUM-SUPPORTED PROBE MEASUREMENT SYSTEM, WE HAVE MADE SOME PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES OF PENDULUM SIZE FOR LARGE ANTENNAS OPERATING AT X-BAND. FINALLY, WE PRESENT A BLOCK DIAGRAM FOR A PROPOSED NEAR-FIELD MEASUREMENT SYSTEM.",

THE SYSTEM WOULD BE BASED ON A GUIDED HORIZONTAL BORING TOOL CAPABLE OF MAKING EXCAVATIONS UP TO 400 FEET IN LENGTH AT DEPTHS UP TO 7 FEET. THE TOOL USES PRESSURIZED FLUID JETS TO CUT THROUGH A WIDE VARIETY OF SOIL TYPES. THE BORING TOOL COULD BE USED TO EITHER DROP AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE AT A DESIRED LOCATION OR TO INSTALL A CONDUIT THAT COULD BE FILLED WITH PUMPABLE EXPLOSIVES. SUCH A SYSTEM WOULD HAVE SEVERAL BENEFITS OVER CONVENTIONAL EXPLOSIVESEMPLACEMENT TECHNIQUES. IT WOULD BE FASTER AND COULD EVENTUALLY BE FULLY AUTOMATED. IT ALSO WOULD OFFER SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED CONCEALMENT SINCE THE TUNNEL WOULD NOT BE VISIBLE IN THE SURFACE. THE GOAL OF THE WORK PROPOSED FOR PHASE I IS TO PROVIDE AN ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT TECHNOLOGY AS RELATED TO DEFENSE NEEDS AND TO IDENTIFY THE REQUIRED DEVELOPMENT AREAS FOR PHASE II.",

THE METHOD REPRESENTS VORTICITY AND SCALARS (CONCENTRATIONS AND TEMPERATURE) BY \"VORTEX\" AND \"SCALAR\" ELEMENTS, RESPECTIVELY, AND HAS THE ADVANTAGE THAT HIGH REYNOLDS NUMBER FLOWS CAN BE SIMULATED ACCURATELY. IN PHASE I, SIMULATIONS WILL BE PERFORMED FOR A TWO-DIMENSIONAL, SPATIALLY DEVELOPING MIXING LAYER. THE FOLLOWING PHYSICAL PHENOMENA WILL BE CONSIDERED: (1) THE ASYMMETRIC MIXING MECHANISM IN A NONREACTING MIXING LAYER; (2) INTERACTIONS BETWEEN LARGE COHERENT STRUCTURES AND FINITE RATE CHEMICAL REACTIONS IN A DILUTE REACTING MIXING LAYER; AND (3) THE NONEQUILIBRIUM EFFECTS OF VARIABLE-TEMPERATURE CHEMICAL REACTIONS ON THE IGNITION AND EXTINCTION CHARACTERISTICS OF A DIFFUSION FLAME. IN PHASE II, A NEW SCHEME WILL BE IMPLEMENTED TO SOLVE THE SCALAR TRANSPORT EQUATIONS, AND THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL PROBLEM WILL BE STUDIED. THE SCALAR ELEMENTS WILL BE REPLACED BY \"SCALAR GRADIENT ELEMENTS\" FOR THE SOLUTION OF THE SCALAR TRANSPORT EQUATIONS. THIS WILL IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY AND THE SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF THE NUMERICAL PROCEDURES SUBSTANTIALLY. NEXT, THREE-DIMENSIONAL CALCULATIONS BY TRACING \"VORTEX FILAMENTS\" WILL BE PERFORMED. SUCH SIMULATIONS WILL EXHIBIT THE EFFECTS OF THREE-DIMENSIONAL TURBULENCE MOTION ON THE CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND ALSO WILL DETERMINE THE RANGE OF VALIDITY OF RECENTLY DEVELOPED ADVANCED TURBULENCE MODELS FOR THE PREDICTION OF SUCH FLOWS.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE PROBLEM OF AERODYNAMIC ENTRAINMENT OF PARTICULATE FROM FRANGIBLE MATERIALS HAS CONSIDERABLE GEOPHYSICAL, TECHNOLOGICAL, AND MILITARY SIGNIFICANCE. PROBLEMS SUCH AS SOIL EROSION, TERRESTRIAL AND PLANETARY DUST STORMS, COAL MINE SAFETY, JET OR DOWNWASH IMPINGEMENT, CHEMICAL PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES AND EXPLOSION GENERATED DUSTY BOUNDARY LAYERS ARE DEPENDENT ON THE PARTICLE SCOURING MECHANISM. THE EFFECT OF TURBULENT TWOPHASE FLOW INTERACTION PROCESSES COMPLICATE THE PROBLEM AND HAVE LIMITED THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING. THE PRESENT PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THESE NEEDS BY APPLYING RECENT DEVELOPMENTS FROM THE CHEMICAL SCIENCES IN THE AREA OF TURBULENT PARTICLE INTERACTION MODELING TO IMPLEMENT A TOOL FOR TURBULENT TWOPHASE BOUNDARY LAYER FLOW ANALYSES. THE TOOL WILL BE UTILIZED TO EXAMINE THE PARAMETRIC DEPENDENCIES OF THE ENTRAINMENT PROCESS RELATIVE TO A RECENTLY DEVELOPED DUSTY BOUNDARY LAYER DATA BASE COLLECTED BY THE DEFENSE TECHNOLOGY SECTOR. KEY AND NOVEL FEATURES OF THE APPROACH INCLUDE A STOCHASTIC PARTICLE MODEL WITH DYNAMIC TURBULENT DIFFUSION AND GAS PHASE TURBULENCE COUPLING, AS WELL AS THE MIXING-CONTROLLED PARTICLE ENTRAINMENT SURFACE INTERACTION MODEL APPLIED TO A NEW AND HERETOFORE UNAVAILABLE DATA BASE. THE OBJECTIVE WILL BE TO RECONCILE THIS NEW DATA WITH THE HISTORICAL DATA FROM OTHER TECHNICAL FIELDS TO DEVELOP AN IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF AN IMPORTANT MULTIDISCIPLINARY PROBLEM.",

HOWEVER, CONVENTIONAL (MONOLITHIC) CERAMICS LACK THE TOUGHNESS REQUIRED OF A GUN BARREL MATERIAL. THE PROPOSED PHASE I EFFORT INVOLVES THE DESIGN, FABRICATION, AND TESTING OF CERAMIC BARREL LINERS TOUGHENED BY THE INCLUSION OF RANDOMLY ORIENTED \"WHISKERS.\" THE LINERS WILL BE FURTHERREINFORCED BY EXTERNAL WRAPPINGS OF CONTINUOUS FIBERS IN A SUITABLE MATRIX. MEANS FOR EXTERNAL COOLING WILL BE DEVELOPED. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO CREATE A GUN BARREL MUCH LIGHTER THAN, AND POTENTIALLY SUPERIOR TO, STEEL BARRELS, AND WHICH CAN WITHSTAND HIGHER RATES OF FIRE SUSTAINED PERIODS.",

THE IMAGES THEMSELVES WILL BE REALIZED WITH AN IMAGING SYSTEM SUCH AS A CRT. THE CONNECTION WITH THE EYEPIECES ON THE HELMET WILL BE MADE BY MEANS OF OPTICAL FIBERS. THE HELMET POSITION AND ORIENTATION HAVE TO BE DETECTED AS REQUIRED FEEDBACK TO THE IMAGE GENERATING SYSTEM. THIS PROJECT SUGGESTS A HOLOGRAPHIC DETECTION SENSOR SYSTEM TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED RESULTS. IN PHASE I, A DESIGN AND FEASIBILITY STUDY WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED.",

THE SOLUTION PROPOSED HERE IS TO USE AN ELECTRONIC SCALE AND COMBINE ITS ELECTRICAL OUTPUT SIGNAL WITH SIGNALS FROM AN ARRAY OF ACCELEROMETERS, IN A MICROPROCESSOR. THE ACCELEROMETERS MEASURE THE VEHICLE MOTIONS AND THE MICROPROCESSOR CONTINUOUSLY COMPUTES THE CORRECTION TO BE APPLIED TO THE WEIGHT SIGNAL. FOR PHASE I OF THE PROJECT WE WILL USE A COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE INDUSTRIAL SCALE (0-50 KG. IS A COMMONLY AVAILABLE CAPACITY), OFF-THE-SHELF ACCELEROMETERS, AND AN IBM PC AS THE MICROPROCESSOR.

THE STARTING POINT FOR ANALYSIS OF FLUORESCENCE-STAINED DNA IN GELS WILL BE THE IMAGE DIGITIZATION OF THE ENTIRE GEL ELECTROPHORETIC PATTERN (OR SPECIFIED PORTIONS OF IT) SO THAT THE RELATIVE INTENSITIES OF FLUORESCENCE WILL BE CONVERTED DIRECTLY TO IMAGE DATA IN COMPUTER MEMORY. ONCE THE GEL FLUORESCENCE IMAGE HAS BEEN DIGITIZED, THE IMAGE PROCESSING SYSTEM WILL PERFORM QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENTS OF THE AMOUNT OF DNA OF VARIOUS SIZES USING SEMIAUTOMATED COMPARISON TO DNA SIZE STANDARDS. ADVANTAGES OF SUCH A SYSTEM INCLUDE FLEXIBILITY, PRECISION, AND RELIABILITY IN THE ANALYSIS; ACCEPTANCE OF VARYING FORMATS FOR GEL ELECTROPHORESIS; AND BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS MICROCOMPUTER-BASED AND PROBABLY CAN BE ASSEMBLED FROM STOCK COMPONENTS, RELATIVELY LOW COST. PHASE I WILL FOCUS ON INVESTIGATIONS OF HARDWARE COMPONENT REQUIREMENTS, ASSEMBLY OF A PRELIMINARY HARDWARE DESIGN TO DEMONSTRATE FEASIBILITY OF THE PROPOSED CONFIGURATION FOR A WORKABLE GEL-DIGITIZATION ANALYSIS INSTRUMENT, AS WELL AS INITIAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TO DEMONSTRATE THE POTENTIAL ANALYTICAL UTILITY OF SUCH A SYSTEM. PHASE II WILL THEN INVOLVE CONSTRUCTION, THOROUGH TESTING AND VALIDATION OF THEOVERALL HARDWARE SYSTEM DESIGN, AND COMPLETE GENERATION OF ASOFTWARE SYSTEM FOR THE ACCURATE AND VERSATILE ANALYSIS OF DNA SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS ON GELS. SYSTEM DESIGN WILL PROVIDE THE BROADEST AND MOST VERSATILE SET OF DNA ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS POSSIBLE, TO ACCOMMODATE NEW APPLICATIONS IN MOLECULAR GENETICS, GENE MAPPING AND SEQUENCING, AND GENETIC TOXICOLOGY.",

SUBTILIS CAN SECRETE SEVERAL PROTEINS OF EUKARYOTIC ORIGIN, ALTHOUGH THIS HAS NOT BEEN AS SUCCESSFUL AS WITH PROTEINS OF BACTERIAL ORIGIN. THIS PROPOSAL IS DESIGNED TO EXAMINE THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST PROTEINS OF EUKARYOTIC ORIGIN IN B. SUBTILIS IS RELATED TO THE TIMING OF PROTEOLYTIC REMOVAL OF THE N-TERMINAL SECRETION SIGNAL PEPTIDE, WHICH OCCURS LATER,RELATIVE TO THE SYNTHESIS OF THE PROTEIN, IN BACTERIA THAN IN EUKARYOTIC SYSTEMS. OVERPRODUCTION OF THE SIGNAL PEPTIDASE ENZYME IN B. SUBTILIS IS PROPOSED, IN ORDER TO ACCELERATE SIGNAL REMOVAL FROM SECRETED PROTEINS. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, CLONING OF THE B. SUBTILIS GENE ENCODING SIGNAL PEPTIDASE IS PROPOSED. THE LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO CONSTRUCT B.

CARBON ADSORPTION IS EMPLOYED FOR THE REMOVAL OF STRONGLY ADSORBABLE TOXINS IN SOME ARTIFICIAL KIDNEY SYSTEMS AS WELL AS IN MOST ARTIFICIAL LIVER CONFIGURATIONS. IN THE REGENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL KIDNEY APPLICATION, A CARBON BED WITH ABOUT 250 GRAMS OF ACTIVATED CARBON IS USED TO ADSORB THE STRONGLY ADSORBABLE SPECIES THAT ACCUMULATE BETWEEN DIALYSIS SESSIONS. THE SPECIFIC AIM OF PHASE I IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF RELIABLE MODIFICATION OF A CARBON BED. THE MODEL SPECIES TO BE INVESTIGATED WILL BE CREATININE, URIC ACID AND VITAMIN B12, AND UREA. WITH THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THESE MODIFICATION METHODS, GINER, INC. WILL PREPARE A PRELIMINARY CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF A REGENERATION SYSTEM AND A PROCEDURE FOR TWO APPLICATIONS: (1) CARBON BEDS USED TO ADSORB URIC ACID, CREATININE MIDDLE MOLECULES, ETC., IN REGENERATIVE, CLOSED-LOOP ARTIFICAL KIDNEYS, SUCH AS THE ELECTROCHEMICALLYREGENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL KIDNEY BEING DEVELOPED BY GINER, INC. AND THE REDY SYSTEM, AND (2) AN ARTIFICIAL KIDNEY BASEDON THE ADSORPTION OF UREA USING CARBON.",

THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE MORE SOPHISTICATED MACHINE VISION SYSTEMS (MVS) PRESENTLY AVAILABLE ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON VIDEO SIGNAL PROCESSING BY DIGITAL COMPUTER. BECAUSE OF THE TWO DIMENSIONAL NATURE OF THE INPUT, THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THAT MUST BE PROCESSED FOR EACH OBJECT IS VAST. THIS IMPLIES THAT THE DECISION PROCESS IS EITHER SLOW OR REQUIRES EXPENSIVE HARDWARE. SINCE OPTICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING IS INTRINSICALLY FASTER THAN DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND IS TWO DIMENSIONAL IN ITS NATURE, IT IS POTENTIALLY BETTER SUITED FOR MVS PROBLEMS. BASED ON ITS UNIQUE EXPERIENCE IN OPTICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING, GLOBAL HOLONETICS PROPOSES TO INVESTIGATE THE USE OF MOIRE' INTERFEROMETRY IN CONJUNCTION WITH OPTICAL FOURIER TRANSFORMS IN A MVS BECAUSE INFORMATION PROCESSED BY THIS OPTICAL PREPROCESSOR IS REDUCED TO A ONE DIMENSIONAL FEATURE VECTOR THAT IS IDEALLY SUITED FOR PROCESSING BY LOW COST DIGITAL HARDWARE. THE RESEARCH WILL DETERMINE WHICH MVS PROBLEMS ARE SUITED TO MOIRE'/ FOURIER INSPECTION AND WHAT KING OF INSPECTION DISCRIMINATION CAN BE REALIZED.

VARIOUS TYPES OF MATERIALS WILL BE RESEARCHED TO INCLUDE FOAM AIR AND HARD FORM PRODUCTS. EMPHASIS WILL BE PLACED ON THE DECOYS HAVING THE CAPABILITY OF BEING LEFT IN THE FIELD AND SUBJECTED TO THE ELEMENTS AS WELL AS BEING SUFFICIENTLY STURDY TO ACCOMODATE FIELD HANDLING DEPLOYMENT. THE DECOYS WILL BE IN MODULAR/COMPRESSED FORM AS NECESSARY TO FACILITATE HANDLING AND STORAGE BUT STILL ALLOW RAPID DEPLOYMENT. EACH PIECE WILL BE LIGHT ENOUGH TO BE MAN PORTABLE. THE UNASSEMBLED/COMPRESSED DECOY WILL OCCUPY A SMALL FRACTION OF THE SPACE OF AN ORIGINAL PIECE OF MILITARY HARDWARE AND BE TRANSPORTABLE BY ORGANIC TACTICAL CARGO VEHICLE. WHILE BEING EMPLACED IN THE FIELD, THE PIECES COULD BE ASSEMBLED/ERECTED BY UNTRAINED INIDIVIDUALS IN LESS THAN 1 MAN HOUR. THE ASEMBLED DECOY WILL BE LIGHT ENOUGH SO THAT IT CAN BE MANEUVERED INTO PLACE AND REPOSITIONED BY HAND. FIELD MAINTENANCE WOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THE SERVICE MEMBERS WITH READILY AVAILABLE MATERIALS SUCH AS TAPE AND VEHICLE PAINT.",

A HOST OF PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE, HOWEVER, WHICH CAN BE USED TO MODIFY THE NATURAL PROPERTIES OF AN ASPHALT CONCRETE. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS RESEARCH ARE TO IDENTIFY THE MOST PROMISING TYPES OF ADDITIVES FOR REDUCING PERMANENT DEFORMATION IN AIRFIELD PAVEMENT. SELECTION WILL BE BASED ON (1) A LITERATURE REVIEW, (2) LABORATORY TESTING OF SELECTED BINDER AND BINDER-AGGREGATE MIXTURES, (3) FIELD PERFORMANCE ESTIMATES, AND (4) AN ANALYSIS OF ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY. BINDER TESTS WILL INCLUDE PENETRATION AND VISCOSITY AT TWO TEMPERATURES AND DUCTILITY. THESE TESTS WILL BE PERFORMED BEFORE AND AFTER AGING IN A ROLLING THIN-FILM OVEN. MIXTURE TESTS WILL INCLUDE MARSHALL STABILITY AND FLOW, RESILIENT MODULUS AT TWO TEMPERATURES, CREEP AT TWO TEMPERATURES, AND SPLITTING TENSILE STRENGTH. THE MIXTURE TESTRESULTS WILL BE USED WITH STATE-OF-THE-ART ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES TO ESTIMATE THE ADDITIVES EFFECTS ON FIELD PERFORMANCE.",

SINCE THERE IS NO ANTIDOTE FOR SUCH POISONING, AVOIDANCE OF CONTAMINATED MATERIAL IS THE ONLY MEANS OF CONTROL. THE CURRENTLY ACCEPTED METHOD OF DETECTING SAXITOXIN AND ITS NATURAL DERIVATIVES IS BY MOUSE BIOASSAY. ALTERNATIVE METHODS HAVE BEEN SOUGHT, BUT EACH HAS ONE OR MORE SIGNIFICANT DRAWBACK. IMMUNOASSAYS APPEAR TO BE THE MOST PROMISING METHOD TO DATE. CURRENT LIMITATIONS OF IMMUNOASSAYS ARE LACK OF ABILITY TO DETECT ALL TOXINS IN THESAXITOXIN GROUP AND PROBLEMS WITH INTERFERENCE DUE TO COMPONENTS IN THE SAMPLE MATRIX. METHODS ARE PROPOSED FOR GENERATING POLYCLONAL AND MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES THAT WILL ENABLE DETECTION OF ALL OF THE SAXITOXINS. PHASE I WILL FOCUS ON THE PREPARATION OF TWO DIFFERENT NEOSAXITOXIN HAPTENS AND THE DEMONSTRATION OF AN IMMUNOLOGICAL RESPONSE IN MICE OR RABBITS. PHASE II WILL EXTEND THE WORK AND CULMINATE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUITABLE NONRADIOACTIVE IMMUNOASSAYS.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED WORK IS TO STUDY EXPERIMENTALLY THE HEAT TRANSFER AND PRESSURE DROP CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ANNULUS OF TWO CONCENTRIC CYLINDERS WITH THE INNER CYLINDER (GROOVED OR UNGROOVED) ROTATING, WITH THE AIM OF MAKING A FEASIBILITY STUDY OF A NOVEL HEAT EXCHANGER. POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE HEAT EXCHANGER ON ON AEROSPACE, AUTOMOTIVE, AND ELECTRONIC INDUSTRIES IS EXPECTED TO BE VERY HIGH.",

THE FIRST MECHANISM TO BE STUDIED IS THE INJECTION OF PRESSURE WAVES OF VARIOUS AMPLITUDES AND FREQUENCIES INTO THE COMBUSTION CHAMBER IN ORDER TO MODIFY THE SOLID PROPELLANT SURFACE REGRESSION RATE AND RESULTANT FLOWRATE, TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE WITH A FIXED MOTOR GEOMETRY. THE SECOND MECHANISM INVOLES CONTROLLING THE WATER INJECTION CHARACTERISTICS INTO THE U-TUBE MIXER/COOLER DOWNSTREAM OF THE GAS GENERATOR. THE ANGLES (SWIRL AND STREAMWISE INCLINATION TO THE MAIN FLOW), FLOWRATE, VELOCITY AND INITIAL ATOMIZATION OF THE WATER INJECTION ON THE DOWNSTREAM PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE SHALL BE COMPUTED FOR A GIVEN INLET GAS FLOWRATE, PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE.

HYDRIDES MANIPULATE HEAT WHILE CHEMICALLY ABSORBING AND DESORBING HYDROGEN OVER A BROAD RANGE OF TEMPERATURES. THE PHASE-CHANGES ARE CONTROLLABLE BY VALVING THE THE FLOW OF HYDROGEN, FROM ONE HYDRIDE TO ANOTHER, REGARDLESS OF TEMPERATURE. THE UNUSUAL CAPABILITIES OF HYDRIDE HEAT PUMPS, REFRIGERATORS AND THERMAL STORAGE DEVICES, RESULT FROM THE ABILITY OF THE GAS PHASE, HYDROGEN, TO \"VAPORIZE\" IN ONE HYDRIDE CONTAINER AND \"CONDENSE\" IN ANOTHER, AT VASTLY DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES, WITHOUT THE NEED FOR A COMPRESSOR. THIS PERMITS NOVEL HEAT COLLECTION, TRANSFER, STORAGE AND REJECTION STRATEGIES THAT ARE NOT FEASIBLE WITH OTHER PHASE-CHANGE MATERIALS. EXTREMELY HIGH THERMAL ENERGY DENSITIES CAN BE ACHIEVED, ESPECIALLY IN HIGH TEMPERATURE THERMAL STORAGE DEVICES. INTERMITTANT HEAT LOADS CAN ALSO UTILIZE THE UNIQUE PROPERTIES OF METAL HYDRIDES FOR ULTRA-COMPACT HEAT PIPES THAT COLLECT AND BUFFER PEAK HEAT LOADS. THIS PROPOSAL OFFERS A DETAILED EXAMINATION OF METAL HYDRIDEALTERNATIVES FOR FUTURE SPACE THERMAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS.

TRADITIONAL FARADAY ROTATION, ZEEMAN EMISSION SPECTROSCOPY, AND MAGNETIC PROBE TECHNIQUES SUFFER FROM POOR SPATIAL RESOLUTION BECAUSE THE MAGNETIC FIELD EFFECT IS INTEGRATED ALONG THE LINE OF SIGHT FOR THE OPTICAL TECHNIQUE AND THE PROBES PERTURB THE PLASMAS. A LASER INDUCED FLUORESCENCE (LIF) TECHNIQUE IS PROPOSED TO MEASURE THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL EVOLUTION OF CONSTANT MAGNETIC FIELD CONTOURS IN THESE DEVICES. THIS TECHNIQUE UTILIZES A DYE LASER TUNED TO A ZEEMAN SHIFTED ELECTRONIC TRANSITION FREQUENCY TO LOCALLY EXCITE THE TARGET ATOMS/IONS TO A HIGHER ENERGY STATE. THE INTENSITY DISTRIBUTION OF THE EMITTED RADIATION EMITTED PERPENDICULAR TO THE BEAM IS A MEASURE OF THE LOCATION OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD CONTOUR IN THE PATH OF THE LASER. A STREAK CAMERA CAN BE USED TO MEASURE THE TEMPORAL MOTION OF THE CONTOURS AND A FRAMING CAMERA CAN BE USED TO RECORD THE SPATIAL PROFILE OF THE CONTOURS. MORE THAN ONE MAGNETIC FIELD CONTOUR CAN BE SIMULTANEOUSLY RECORDED USING AN ELECTRONIC TRANSITION HAVING A COMPLEX ZEEMAN SPECTRUM. THE TECHNIQUE IS APPLICABLE TO MEASURE LARGE MAGNETIC FIELDS (10 GK - 1 MG) WHEN THE ZEEMAN SHIFT IS LARGE COMPARED TO THE ABSORPTION LINEWIDTH OF THE TRANSITION PROBED.",

A PRELIMINARY STUDY OF OLIGOMERS FROM THE TYPE 2 COLONIAL FORM OF NEISSERIA GONORRHOEAE HAS SHOWN THAT THEY WERE BETTER THAN INTACT PILI FOR ELICITING ANTIBODIES THAT CROSS-REACT WITH PILI FROM HETEROLOGOUS STRAINS. THIS RESULT SUGGESTS THAT A VACCINE CONTAINING OLIGOMERS SHOULD PROVIDE BETTER CROSS-PROTECTION THAN ONE CONTAINING INTACT PILI. IN THIS PROPOSAL, ANTIBODIES ELICITED BY OLIGOMERS FROM UP TO 10 STRAINS OF NEISERRIA GONORRHOEAE WILL BE EXAMINED TO (1) CONFIRM THEIR CAPACITY FOR CROSS-REACTIVITY WITH INTACT PILI FROM HETEROLOGOUS STRAINS, AND (2) DETERMINE THEIR CAPACITY FOR PREVENTING BACTERIAL ADHESION TO HUMAN CELLS. IF A SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE FOR THE USE OF OLIGOMERS IS INDICATED, A PHASE II APPLICATION WOULD BE MADE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PROTOTYPE GONORRHEA VACCINE BASED ON THOSE STRAINS YIELDING OLIGOMERS WITH THE GREATEST DEGREE OF CROSS-REACTIVITY.",

THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO PURSUE TWO RELATED OBJECTIVES: EVALUATION OF THE CONCEPT OF PRESCREENING OF IMAGING PROCEDURE REQUESTS AND EVALUATION/REFINEMENT OF THE ACTUAL PRODUCT. THE FIRST OBJECTIVE WILL BE ACHIEVED BY INTERVIEWING PERSONNEL IN A VARIETY OF HOSPITALS, FOCUS GROUPS, AND POTENTIAL USERS OF THE SYSTEM. THE SECOND OBJECTIVE WILL BE ACHIEVED BY INSTALLING THE SYSTEM IN A LOCAL HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM AND ASSESSING ITS ACCEPTABILITY, IMPACT ON PHYSICIAN ATTITUDES AND KNOWLEDGE, IMPACT ON PHYSICIAN ORDERING PATTERNS, AND IMPACT ON HOSPITAL COSTS.

THE METHOD WE PROPOSE FOR SATISFYING THESE REQUIREMENTS IS TO ADAPT A TOP-DOWN DESIGN SYSTEM FOR ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS BEING DEVELOPED FOR THE U.S. NAVY TO MODEL-ING OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS. THE GOALS OF PERFORMANCE MODELING FOR THE ARMY'S COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE GOALS OF MODELING FOR COMMERCIAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS. PERFORMANCE MODELING OF COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH OPTIMALITY UNDER RATHER STABLE OPERATING CONDITIONS. MODELING OF MILITARY SYSTEMS IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH ADEQUACY UNDER DYNAMIC CONDITIONS. PERFORMANCE IN THE PRESENCE OF FAULTS AND PERFORMANCE WITH DEGRADED RESOURCES ARE OF PRIME IMPORTANCE. THE OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE A DESIGN AND DESIGN EVALUATION SYSTEM WHICH MEETS THESE NEEDS IS AFFORDED BY THE CONFLUENCE OF SEVERAL TECHNOLOGIES. COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS ARE INCREASINGLY BEING BUILT FROM STANDARD COMPONENTS WHOSE INDIVIDUAL PROPERTIES ARE KNOWN. A REPERTOIRE OF TOOLS FOR EVALUTION OF MODELS OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS IS APPEARING.

THESE COMPOUNDS HAVE PROVEN EFFECTIVEIN THE IN VITRO ELIMINATION OF A NUMBER OF CELL TYPES, INCLUDING LEUKEMIA CELLS AND THE BONE MARROW CELLS IMPLICATED IN GRAFT VERSUS HOST DISEASE. IMMUNOTOXINS MAY THUS BE AN EFFECTIVE WAY OF CONTROLLING A NUMBER OF DISEASE ATTRIBUTABLE TO A POPULATION OF ANTIGENICALLY DISTINCT CELLS. THE IN VIVO USE OF IMMUNOTOXINS IS CURRENTLY LIMITED BY AN UNACCEPTABLY HIGH LEVEL OF NONSPECIFIC TOXICITY. THIS IS LIKELY TO RESULT FROM THE ABILITY OF THE TOXIC COMPONENT TO ENTER THE CYTOSOL WITHOUT ANTIBODY HELP. THE GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP IMMUNOTOXIN COMPONENTS THAT RETAIN THEIR INTRACELLULAR TOXICITY, BUT ARE INCAPABLE OF TRANSMEMBRANE RELOCATION UNLESS BOUND TO ANTIBODY. FIVE RIBOSOME-INACTIVATING PROTEINS CAPABLE OF FUNCTIONING AS IMMUNOTOXIN COMPONENTS WILL BE ENZYMATICALLY OR CHEMICALLY CLEAVED INTO SMALLER PEPTIDES. IT IS HOPED THAT BY THIS PROCESS FUNCTIONAL DOMAINS OF THE TOXINS CAN BE FOUND THAT RETAIN THE ABILITY TO CATALYTICALLY INACTIVATE RIBOSOMES, BUT ARE INCAPABLE OF SELF-DIRECTED ENTRY INTO THECYTOSOL. THE ACTIVITY OF THESE PEPTIDES WILL BE TESTED IN VITRO IN WHOLE-CELL AND CELL-FREE ASSAYS OF PROTEIN SYNTHESIS, AS WELL AS IN VIVO WHERE THE LD50 OF ACTIVE PEPTIDES WILL BE COMPARED TO THAT OF THE INTACT TOXIN. THE AMINO ACID SEQUENCE OF ACTIVE PEPTIDES WILL ALSO BE DETERMINED.",

THE LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO IMPROVE THE YIELD OF GENETICALLY ENGINEERED ANTIBODIES OF THERAPEUTIC VALUE. PHASE I WILL INVESTIGATE TWO APPROACHES TO INCREASE EXPRESSION. ONE APPROACH IS TO IDENTIFY HOST MYELOMA CELLS THAT ARE MORE ACTIVE IN EXPRESSING TRANSFECTED IG GENES; THE OTHER APPROACH IS TO DEVELOP SCHEMES TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF GENE COPIES THAT ARE EXPRESSED. PHASE II RESEARCH WILL IMPLEMENT THE FINDINGS OF PHASE I TO FORMULATE A METHODOLOGY AND SET UP EXPERIMENTS TO EXPRESS HIGH LEVELS OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED ANTIBODIES. THE RESEARCH THAT IS PROPOSED HERE COULD LEAD TO THE PRODUCTION OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED ANTIBODIES IN YIELDS COMPARABLE TO THAT OF HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE MYELOMA OR HYBRIDOMA CELL LINES. THIS WOULD THEN MAKE THE PRODUCTION OF GENETICALLY ENGINEERED ANTIBODIES A COMMERCIALLY FEASIBLE PROCESS.",

THE OBJECTIVES OF PHASE I ARE TO PRODUCE AN ACCURATE MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF THE PHYSICAL AND ELECTRICAL BEHAVIOR OF SURFACE ACOUSTIC WAVE (SAW) MASS SENSORS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED DESIGNS. IT IS KNOWN THAT SAW SENSORS ARE ELECTRONIC DEVICES THAT RESPOND TO THE DEPOSITION OF MASS ON THEIR SURFACE. IN THIS RESEARCH PLAN THE PROPAGATION OF ACOUSTIC SURFACE WAVES THROUGH THIN PIEZOELECTRIC CRYSTALS WILL BE STUDIED TODETERMINE HOW MASS RESPONSE OCCURS IN THE PRESENCE OF A LIQUID AND HOW SUCH A RESPONSE CAN BE CONTROLLED. PRELIMINARY MODELS WILL BE PREPARED, AND THEIR PREDICTIONS WILL BE COMPARED WITH EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONS OF ACOUSTIC WAVE VELOCITIES AND CRYSTAL PARTICLE DISPLACEMENTS.MODIFICATIONS TO THE MODEL AND EXPERIMENTAL MEASUREMENTS WILL BE MADE REPETITIVELY UNTIL THE TWO CONVERGE. THE MODEL WILL THEN BE EXTENDED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE PRESENCE OF THIN FILMS AND LIQUIDS ON THE SURFACE OF THE SAW DEVICES.THE SAME STRATEGY OF COMPARISON BETWEEN MODEL PREDICTIONS AND EXPERIMENT WILL BE APPLIED TO ENSURE MODEL ACCURACY. AFTER AN EXTENDED MODEL IS COMPLETED, IT WILL BE USED TO PREDICT A BEST SENSOR DESIGN, WHICH THEN WILL BE EXPERIMENTALLY TESTED AND OPTIMIZED THROUGH A SPECIALIZED EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN STRATEGY.",

THESE TECHNIQUES ARE SOMETIMES CALLED REPEAT-STATIC TECHNIQUES BECAUSE THEY MAKE NO USE OF THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE SUCCESSIVE IMAGES IN THE PREPARATION OF THE IMAGES. FOR REALISTIC ANIMATION REQUIRING THOUSANDS OF FRAMES, THE COMPUTATIONAL COST CAN BE PROHIBITIVE, AND THE TURN-AROUND TIME UNACCEPTABLE. IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE DESCRIBE HOW FRAME-TO-FRAME COHERENCE CAN BE USED TO DRASTICALLY REDUCE THE IMAGE PREPARATION TIME AND COST. THE APPROACH MAKES USE OF THE FACT THAT IN ANIMATION, ANY IMAGE IN THE SEQUENCE IS USUALLY ALMOST IDENTICAL TO ITS PREDECESSOR. HENCE, MOST INFORMATION REQUIRED FOR VISIBLE STATUS DETERMINATION NEEDS NOT BE RECOMPUTED IF FRAME-TO-FRAME COHERENCE PROPERTY IS INCORPORATED INTO THE IMAGE GENERATION PROCESS.",

THIS WILL PROVIDE LABILE FETAL DATA (ECG, BLOOD GASES) AND OTHER DATA REFLECTING THE TOTALITY OF RECENT METABOLIC INSULTS (PH, TEMPERATURE). THE UTILITY OF CIM OF FETAL ECG AND PH SAMPLING IS WELL KNOWN. THE LITERATURE INDICATES THAT THE CIM OF PO2, PCO2, AND FETAL-MATERNAL TEMPERATURES MAY BE OF VALUE, AND IT IS BELIEVED THAT THEY CAN BE USED TO DETECT IMPROPER PROBE PLACEMENT. THE COMPLETE CIM DATA SHOULD ENHANCE THE RELIABILITY OF FETAL DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPY. INTERNATIONAL BIOMEDICS, INC HAS DEVELOPED AND EVALUATED A CIM SPIRAL ECG/TISSUE PH PROBE IN A 300-PATIENT, INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE EXEMPTION (IDE) CONTROLLED STUDY FOR THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION. IN ADDITION, A 430-MICRON-DIAMETER, MULTIPARAMETER (MP) INTRAVASCULAR PROBE FOR PO2, PCO2, PH, AND TEMPERATURE IS BEING TESTED. DURING PHASE I, THE MP SYSTEM WILL BE ADAPTED TO THE NEEDS OF CIM, AND THE BENCH, TOXICOLOGY, AND INSTRUMENT QUALIFICATION STUDIES WILL BE COMPLETED. DURING PHASE II, ASUBCUTANEOUS POUCH AND FETAL ANIMAL STUDIES WILL BE PERFORMED IN PIGS TO QUANTIFY THE SUBCUTANEOUS PROBE DATA VERSUS ARTERIAL AND VENOUS DATA. LATER IN PHASE II, IDE-CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS OF SAFETY, EFFECTIVENESS, AND CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE WILL OCCUR.

SEVERAL FULL-LENGTH CLONES WERE CHARACTERIZED AND FOUND TO BE APPROXIMATELY 2,100 BP LONG. THE PN CLONES CONTAINED A 1,260 BP OPEN-READING FRAME THAT DEFINES A 401-AMINO ACID PROTEIN WITH A CHARACTERISTIC LEADER PEPTIDE OF 19 AMINO ACIDS. TWO OF THE FULL-LENGTH CDNA CLONES HAVE BEEN SEQUENCED, AND PNB DIFFER BY TWO AMINO ACIDS, WHICH IS THE RESULT OF INSERTION OF A THREE-BASE CODON, CAG, INTO THE CODING SEQUENCE. THIS THREE-BASE INSERTION PRESERVES THE CODING FRAME, BUT CHANGES THE AMINO ACID SEQUENCE FOR PNA FROM ARG TO THR-GLY IN PNB. THE INSERTION OF THE TRIPLET MAY BE THE RESULT OF AN ALTERNATE SPLICE IN THE 3' REGION OF THE PN GENE. CURRENT STUDIES WILL FOCUS ON DETERMINING THE MECHANISM BY WHICH PNA AND PNB ARISE AND COMPARING THE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES OF THESE PNS. THE STRUCTURE OF THE PN-I GENE WILL BE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE IF THE REGION ENCODING THE INSERTED TRIPLET IS LOCATED AT AN INTRON/EXON JUNCTION AS WOULD BE PREDICTED BY THE MODEL FOR ALTERNATE SPLICING OF THE PRECURSOR MRNA.

THE ATTITUDE CONTROL ALGORITHMS ARE FLIGHT PROVEN ON HCMM, SAGE, ERBS AND SME. KEY ELEMENTS: AN INNOVATIVE 4-POINT SCANNING HORIZON SENSOR THAT IS ALTITUDE INDEPENDENT. THE SENSOR WILL USE A STANDARD MOTOR ALREADY PRODUCED AND A PYRO-ELECTRIC DETECTOR. A DEMONSTRATION MODEL HAS BEEN PRODUCED. THE SENSOR IS INHERENTLY INEXPENSIVE TO BUILD, AND DOES THE JOB OF TWO CONICAL EARTH SENSORS WITH LESS ELECTRONICS. A LOW COST MOMENTUM/REACTION WHEEL OF 1-2 FT. LB. SECONDS. WE WILL WORK WITH SCHAEFFER MAGNETICS TO DEVELOP A PRELIMINARY DESIGN: COST GOAL, $15,000. SCHAEFFER MAKES THEMOTOR ASSEMBLY FOR OUR PRESENT CONICAL EARTH SENSOR. EXISTING MOMENTUM/REACTION WHEEL VENDORS ARE MUCH TOO COSTLY. THE MAGNETIC CONTROL SYSTEM PROVIDES ACQUISITION, ROLL-YAW CONTROL, NUTATION DAMPING, AND MOMENTUM CONTROL. SIMPLIFIED CIRCUITRY, INNOVATIVE PACKAGING, STANDARDIZED DOCUMENTATION AND AUTOMATIC TESTING ARE THE KEYS TO CONTROL COSTS.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE AIM OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO INVESTIGATE AND DEVELOP LONG-TERM IONTOPHORETIC PROCEDURES FOR DELIVERY OF NARCOTIC AGENTS. IONTOPHORESIS HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME, BUT ITS APPLICATION IS LIMITED TO SHORT-TERM PROCEDURES (15 TO 30 MINUTES). THE MAJOR IMPEDIMENT TO LONG-TERM USE IS THE FORMATION OF ELECTROLYTIC PRODUCTS AT THE ELECTRODE, LOWERING THE EFFICIENCY OF DRUG TRANSPORT AND CAUSING BURNS. THESE PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED AND LONG-TERM DELIVERY HAS BEEN STUDIED BOTH THEORETICALLY AND EXPERIMENTALLY WITH MORPHINE AS A MODEL DRUG. AS A RESULT, TREATMENT TIMES HAVE BEEN EXTENDED UP TO 2 HOURS WITH SIGNIFICANT MORPHINE LEVELS IN BLOOD AND NO COMPLICATIONS. THE PROPOSED STUDY INVOLVES (1) LABORATORY IN VITRO DETERMINATIONS OF IONTOPHORETIC ELECTRODE EFFICIENCY AND DELIVERY RATES OVER LONG (12 TO 24 HOURS) APPLICATION TIMES USING AN AUTOMATED, COMPUTER-CONTROLLED SAMPLING SYSTEM; (2) ANIMAL EXPERIMENTS USING NUDE RATS WITH ISOLATED SKIN FLAPS IN ORDER TO DETERMINE LONG-TERM DELIVERY RATES WITH (14)C MORPHINE HC1; AND (3) A CONTROLLED, DOUBLE-BLIND CLINICAL STUDY INVOLVING PATIENTS AFFLICTED BY SEVERE POSTOPERATIVE PAIN. THE RESULT OF THESE STUDIES WILL BE A NEW IONTOPHORETIC DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR NARCOTIC ANALGESICS, PRIMARILY MORPHINE. IN PHASE II, NEW ELECTRODE FORMULATIONS AND AN IONTOPHORETICCONTROL DEVICE WILL BE DESIGNED, FABRICATED, AND USED IN LARGE-SCALE, LONG-TERM CLINICAL TRIALS.",

THE MAJOR IMPEDIMENT TO LONG-TERM USE IS THE FORMATION OF ELECTROLYTIC PRODUCTS AT THE ELECTRODE, LOWERING THE EFFICIENCY OF DRUG TRANSPORT AND CAUSING BURNS. THESE PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED AND LONG-TERM DELIVERY HAS BEEN STUDIED BOTH THEORETICALLY AND EXPERIMENTALLY WITH MORPHINE AS A MODEL DRUG. AS A RESULT, TREATMENT TIMES HAVE BEEN EXTENDED UP TO 2 HOURS WITH SIGNIFICANT MORPHINE LEVELS IN BLOOD AND NO COMPLICATIONS. THE PROPOSED STUDY INVOLVES (1) LABORATORY IN VITRO DETERMINATIONS OF IONTOPHORETIC ELECTRODE EFFICIENCY AND DELIVERY RATES OVER LONG (12 TO 24 HOURS) APPLICATION TIMES USING AN AUTOMATED, COMPUTER-CONTROLLED SAMPLING SYSTEM; (2) ANIMAL EXPERIMENTS USING NUDE RATS WITH ISOLATED SKIN FLAPS IN ORDER TO DETERMINE LONG-TERM DELIVERY RATES WITH (14)C MORPHINE HC1; AND (3) A CONTROLLED, DOUBLE-BLIND CLINICAL STUDY INVOLVING PATIENTS AFFLICTED BY SEVERE POSTOPERATIVE PAIN. THE RESULT OF THESE STUDIES WILL BE A NEW IONTOPHORETIC DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR NARCOTIC ANALGESICS, PRIMARILY MORPHINE.

ALTHOUGH SOME SYSTEMSHAVE BEEN DESIGNED THAT ALLOW COMMUNICATION BETWEEN FASTBUS AND VMEBUS, NONE TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE WIDE RANGE OF COMMUNICATION MODES THAT ARE POSSIBLE WITH THESE BUS STRUCTURES. THIS PROJECT SUGGESTS THAT WITH THE PROPER KNOWLEDGE OF THESE BUS STRUCTURES, CURRENT INTERFACE TECHNOLOGY, AND THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF THE PROSPECTIVE USERS OF THESE SYSTEMS, A MORE WIDELY ACCEPTED AND POWERFUL FASTBUS TO VMEBUS INTERFACE COULD BE DESIGNED. TO THIS END A DETAILED STUDY OF FASTBUS AND VMEBUS SPECIFICATIONS WILL BE CARRIED OUT. A STUDY OF AVAILABLE VME-FASTBUS INTERFACES WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THE CURRENT TECHNOLOGY. A SURVEY OF USERS, ESPECIALLY IN THE HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS COMMUNITY, WILL YIELD VALUABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR PARTICULAR REQUIREMENTS FOR SUCH A DEVICE. THEN, ALL OF THIS INFORMATION WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE A DESIRED SET OF INTERFACE FEATURES. THE FEASIBILITY OF INCORPORATING THESE FEATURES INTO ONE OF SEVERAL GENERAL MODELS WILL BE JUDGED. ON THE BASIS OF THIS JUDGEMENT, A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PLANNED DEVICE WILL BE SUBMITTED ALONG WITH A BLOCK DIAGRAM INDICATING THE DEVICE'S FUNCTIONAL ELEMENTS AND THEIR INTERCONNECTIONS.

THE FWC APPROACH IS A COMBINATION AND UPDATE OF ELEMENTS FROM TRAINING RESEARCH STUDIES CONDUCTED OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS. NEW HARDWARE TECHNOLOGY HAS LOWERED THE COSTS OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF OLD STUDIES SO THAT WHAT WAS THEN EFFECTIVE IS NOW COST EFFECTIVE.

IN THE AC HIERARCHY, THE REALTIME STATUS OF THE FMS IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AT EACH LEVEL. THE HIGHEST LEVEL ORGANIZES FMS COMPONENTS TO MEET SHORT-TERM PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS AND THE LOWEST LEVEL ISSUES COMMANDS TO A ROBOT CONTROLLER. THE WORK FOR PHASE I FOCUSES ON THE LOWER LEVEL OF THE AC, WHERE THE TASK IS TO ASSURE CONFLICT-FREE OPERATION OF THE SYSTEM. WE EMPHASIZE THE LOWER LEVEL IN THIS WORK AS IT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL BUILDING BLOCK (BEYOND COMMUNICATION) FOR SYSTEM INTEGRATION.

THE KNOWLEDGE BASE WILL BE A COMBINATION OF CORE KNOWLEDGE, DERIVED FROM LEADING AUTHORITATIVE SUBSPECIALTY TEXTBOOKS, PLUS INTEGRATED UPDATING OF INFORMATION FROM THE CURRENT LITERATURE. IT WILL BE AVAILABLE ONLINE, ACCESSIBLE WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF TERMINALS OR MICROCOMPUTERS. A NATURAL LANGUAGE CAPABILITY ALLOWS THE PHYSICIAN TO TYPE AN INQUIRY IN NATURAL ENGLISH AND QUICKLY RECEIVE PARAGRAPHS PROVIDED IN ORDER OF THEIR RANKED RELEVANCE TO THE QUERY. THE SYSTEM ALSO ALLOWS BROWSING WITHIN THE HIERARCHICAL CONTENTS TO FIND INFORMATION PROVIDING DIFFERENT LEVELS OF DETAIL, OR TO OBTAIN CONTEXTUAL UNDERSTANDING. THE FIRST INTEGRATED KNOWLEDGE BASE WILL BE ON GASTROINTESTINAL CANCER. SUCCESSFUL DEMONSTRATION OF ITS USEFULNESS TO PHYSICIANS WILL LEAD TO COVERAGE OF THE LARGER FIELDS OF ONCOLOGY AND GASTROINTESTINAL DISEASE, AND FINALLY TO ALL OF INTERNAL MEDICINE.

THIS 0.5 LITER VOLUME INTERCATIVE SYSTEM CAN BE USED FOR THIS APPLICATION, REGARDING PACKAGING MODIFICATIONS FOR HYPERBARIC APPLICATION, HYDROPHONE INTERFACE, SALINE SONIC TRANSMISSION CHARACTERISTICS, AND LIKE CONCERNS. PROTOTYPE RECEIVERS AND PILLS HAVE BEEN BUILT AND TESTED. WE PROPOSE TO EXTEND THIS TECHNOLOGY SO THAT ALL TEMPERATURE SENSORS ARE COUPLED TO MINIATURE TRANSMITTERS, FREEING THE DIVER FROM ENCUMBERING INSTRUMENTATION HARNESSES, AND FREEING PHYSIOLOGICAL EXPERIMENTS OF THE NEED TO CHANGE HARNESSES TO SUIT DIFFERENT PHYSIQUES AND CHANGING EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS. WE PROPOSE DELIVERABLE HARDWARE (PILLS, TRANSCEIVERS, BASE STATION) USED IN A NEAR SUFACE SALINE ENVIRONMENT OR AIR. WE SHALL PROGRAM THE RECEIVER TO MONITOR MULTIPLE TRANSMITTERS AND RELAY THE DATA. WE SHALL TEST INTRA-SYSTEM RF PROPAGATION IN THE SALINE AND ON SHIPBOARD, AND STUDY OTHER SYSTEM INTERCATIONS (HYDROPHONE, DISPLAY, ETC.). A MULTIPARAMETER PHYSIOLOGICAL MONITORING SYSTEM FREE FROM THE NEED OF CABLE HOOKUPS WOULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE, LESS HAMPERING, AND SAFER. SUCH A SYSTEM WOULD SIMPLIFY INSTALLATION OF A VARIETY OF SENSOR TYPES, ON DIFFERENT PHYSIQUES AND SITES. THE SMALL SIZE OF INDIVIDUAL TRANSMITTERS AND THE MASTER RECEIVER WOULD MAKE DATA ACQUISITION FEASIBLE IN A LOW-TECH ENVIRONMENT (FIRE-FIGHTERS, CHEMICAL SPILL WORKERS, ATHLETES, ORTHOPEDIC REHABILITATION) AS WELL AS FOR DIVERS.",

TO CAPTURE FULLY THE POTENTIAL, TREATMENT OF THE SYNTHESIS GAS TO REMOVE OBJECTIONABLE ELEMENTS IN A HOT, HIGH PRESSURE STREAM IS ESSENTIAL. VOLATILE TRACE ALKALI METALS HAVE BEEN FOUND IN RAW GASES PRODUCED BY COAL GASIFICATION. THE USE OF IN-BED DESULFURIZATION INCREASES THE POTENTIAL FOR ALKALI METAL CONTAMINATION OF THE RAW GAS. THESE METALS ARE A SOURCE OF CORROSION IN THE GAS TURBINES OF A COMBINED CYCLE PLANT AS WELL AS A POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERN. ALUMINA IS A KNOWN ABSORBENT FOR ALKALI METALS. A PARALLEL PASSAGE REACTOR FABRICATED FROM SCREENS IMPREGNATED WITH ALUMINA WILL BE TESTED AS A LOW PRESSURE DROP GAS PHASE ALKALI METAL SCAVENGER. THIS TECHNOLOGY APPEARS TO OFFER A LOW COST APPROACH TO REMOVAL OF ALKALI METALS FROM HOT GAS STREAMS.",

IN ADDITION, AN OBJECT CAN BE VIEWED FROM MANY VIEWPOINTS, ADDING TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ANALYSIS TASK. IDENTIFICATION OF \"HOT SPOTS\" USING RADAR CROSS SECTIONS IS USEFUL FOR BOTH TARGET RECOGNITION AND FOR COUNTERMEASURE PURPOSES. WE ARE PROPOSING TO STUDY THE APPLICABILITY OF SEVERAL RELATED AND COMPLEMENTARY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE APPROACHES FOR THE ANALYSIS OF RADAR CROSS SECTIONS. ONE TECHNIQUE OPERATES PRIMARILY IN THE FREQUENCY DOMAIN AND THE OTHER MAINLY IN THE SPATIAL DOMAIN. WE WILL EVALUATE THESE TECHNIQUES AND EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OF COMBINING THEM TO ACHIEVE A ROBUST MULTI-DOMAIN ANALYSIS TOOL.

THE IDEA IS TO SELECTIVELY IRRADIATE COMBUSTION SPECIES.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO PRODUCE A GUIDE THAT WILL ADVISE SMALL BUSINESS EMPLOYERS OF ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS, SUCH AS HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS, AND OF CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS, SUCH AS PREFERRED-PROVIDER ORGANIZATIONS; THESE COULD MAKE HEALTH INSURANCE MORE AFFORDABLE AND LESS ADMINISTRATIVELY CUMBERSOME. IN ADDITION TO A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF ALTERNATIVE MODES OF COVERAGE, THE GUIDE WILL SUGGEST FACTORS THAT MAY BE HELPFUL IN MAKING AN APPROPRIATE CHOICE.INCREASED COMPETITION AND INNOVATION ARE EXPECTED TO BRING ABOUT CHANGES IN THE HEALTH CARE MARKETPLACE. SOME ORGANIZATIONAL MODELS WILL DISAPPEAR; OTHERS WILL ADAPT. THE GUIDE CONCLUDES BY DISCUSSING ANTICIPATED CHANGES WHICH MAY EFFECT THE SMALL BUSINESS EMPLOYER'S FUTURE CHOICES.

THIS RESEARCH IS DIRECTED AT THE MITIGATION OF SUCH DAMAGE THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF EXTRACTS DERIVED FROM CULTIVATED MARINE ALGAE TO THE FOLIAGES OF CROPS AND TREES. MARICULTURAINC.'S EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT EXTRACTS DERIVED FROM ALGAE HAVE EFFECTS ON HIGHER-ORDER PLANTS THAT BOTH PROTECT THE CROP OR TREE FROM OXIDANT DAMAGE AND AID IN THE RECOVERY OF SPECIES ALREADY INJURED BY THE AIR POLLUTANTS. THESE DAMAGE MITIGATION EFFECTS ARE DISTINCT FROM THE WELL- KNOWN ACCELERATION AND MODIFICATION OF PLANT GROWTH FROM THEALGAL HORMONES (CYTOKININS, GIBBERELLINS, AND AUXINS). IN PHASE I THE EFFECTS OF ALGAL EXTRACTS ON NORMAL AND OZONE- DAMAGED SOYBEANS, GREENBEANS, AND TOBACCO WILL BE QUANTITA- TIVELY EVALUATED UNDER GREENHOUSE CONDITIONS AND UNDER FIELD-LIKE CONDITIONS UTILIZING EXTRACTS FROM THREE DIFFER- ENT ALGAE.

        "abstract": "Abstract         DURING MOST SURGICAL PROCEDURES THE PATIENT IS PARALYZED AND MUST DEPEND COMPLETELY ON THE ANESTHESIOLOGIST TO MAINTAIN SUCH VITAL PHYSIOLOGIC FUNCTIONS AS BREATHING AND HEART RATE. IT IS THEREFORE NOT SUPRISING THAT, WITH RELATIVELY FEW EFFECTIVE PHYSIOLOGICAL MONITORS AVAILABLE TO THE ANESTHESIOLOGIST, THE FREQUENCY OF MISHAPS DURING SURGERY IS HIGH. OF THE APPROXIMATELY 20 MILLION SURGICAL PROCEDURES PERFORMED ANNUALLY IN THIS COUNTRY, IT IS ESTIMATED THAT ABOUT 6,000 PEOPLE DIE OR BECOME SERIOUSLY DISABLED AS A RESULT OF THE ANESTHETIC PROCEDURE. ANESTHESIA MONITORING CAN BE DIVIDED INTO (1) MONITORS THAT PRIMARILY CHECK THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ANESTHESIA DELIVERY SYSTEM, AND (2) MONITORS THAT MEASURE THE PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF THE ANESTHETIC PROCEDURE ON THE PATIENT. THE GOAL OF THE PROPOSED WORK IS TO EXTEND THE CAPABILITIES OF A MONITORING SYSTEM PRESENTLY DESIGNED FOR PERFORMANCE CHECKING TO ALSO MONITOR PHYSIOLOGICAL VARIABLES. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM WILL BE CAPABLE OF CONTINUOUSLY MONITORING CIRCULATION, VENTILATION, AND GAS EXCHANGE VARIABLES. ANESTHETIC GAS UPTAKE AND TISSUE CONCENTRATION ARE BY-PRODUCT MEASUREMENTS OF THE METHOD. THE KEY TO ECONOMICAL AND HIGH-QUALITY MEASUREMENTS OF THESECARDIOPULMONARY PARAMETERS IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MINIATURIZED, HIGH-QUALITY MASS SPECTROMETER, ALREADY COMPETITIVELY PRICED FOR SERVICE AS JUST AN ANESTHETIC GAS MONITOR. HOWEVER, AS THIS ANALYZER REPRESENTS THE MAJOR COST OF A TOTAL ANESTHESIA/PHYSIOLOGIC MONITORING SYSTEM, THE PHYSIOLOGICAL MONITORING CAPABILITY REPRESENTS AN ADDITIONAL, SUBSTANTIAL MONITORING BENEFIT AT A DISPROPORTIONATELY MODEST COST.",

MICROEMBOLI (CLOTS OF THE MICROCIRCULATION) ARE THEREFORE TOO SMALL TO BE DETECTED BY STANDARD METHODS. BECAUSE MICROEMBOLI ARE NOT DETECTABLE, THERE IS NO DIRECT EVIDENCE THAT MICROEMBOLIINVOLVEMENT IS OF CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE. HOWEVER, MICROEMBOLIC INVOLVEMENT HAS BEEN PROPOSED AS A PRINCIPAL CAUSATIVE FACTOR IN ADULT RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS), A TRAUMA-ASSOCIATED DISEASE HAVING A HIGH MORTALITY (OVER 50 PERCENT) IN YOUNG ADULTS. MICROEMBOLIC INVOLVEMENT IN OTHER TRAUMA-ASSOCIATED CONDITIONS, INCLUDING SURGERY, IS ALSO SPECULATIVE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO ESTABLISH THE FEASIBILITYOF APPLYING A NEW AND NONINVASIVE METHOD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PRACTICAL INSTRUMENT FOR SENSITIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DETECTION OF MICROEMBOLIC INVOLVEMENT IN HUMAN LUNGS. PHASE I WILL ADDRESS VALIDATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE NEW METHOD IN EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS. THE ECONOMIC GOAL OF PHASE II WILL BE TO TEST THE LIKELIHOOD OF MICROEMBOLIC DETECTION BECOMING A STANDARD MEDICAL PRACTICE. ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THIS GOAL WILL INVOLVE A COMBINATION OF TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT AND SCIENTIFIC STUDIES.

THIS METHOD IS AN OPTO-ELECTRONIC METHOD, IS COMPLETELY AUTOMATED, EXTREMELY FAST AND IS CAPABLE OF OBTAINING ACCURACIES AND RESOLUTIONS COMPARABLE WITH PRISM SPECTROMETERS. THIS MEASUREMENT METHOD IS CALLED ABSORPTIONDIGITAL REFRACTOMETRY. THE MOST ACCURATE METHOD AT PRESENT FOR OBTAINING REFRACTIVE INDICES IS WITH THE DIVIDED CIRCLE PRISM SPECTROMETER. IT IS CAPABLE OF DETERMINING THE REFRACTIVE INDEX TO SIX DECIMAL PLACES WITH AN ACCURACY OF 1X10-6. HOWEVER, THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE, REQUIRE THE FABRICATION OF AN (UNKNOWN) MATERIAL INTO A \"PERFECT\" EQUILATERAL PRISM, ARE SPECTRALLY RESTRICTED, PRACTICALLY LIMITED TO TRANSPARENT MATERIALS ANDARE NOT READILY ADAPTED TO AUTOMATION. ABSORPTION DIGITAL REFRACTOMETRY OVERCOMES ALL OF THESE LIMITATIONS. THE EQUATIONS FOR DETERMINING THE REFRACTIVE INDEX AND THE EXTINCTION COEFFICIENT ARE DERIVED USING THE STOKES POLARIZATION PARAMETERS AND THE MUELLER MATRIX FORMULATION. IN THE FINAL SECTION THE PROPOSED LABORATORY CONFIGURATION IS DESCRIBED. IF THE CONCEPT OF ABSORPTION DIGITAL REFRACTOMETRY IS VALIDATED IT IS BELIEVED THAT A COMMERCIAL SYSTEM COULD BE BUILT WHICH WOULD FIND NUMEROUS APPLICATIONSIN THE DEVELOPMENT OF OPTICAL MATERIALS.",

NICOTINE FADERS REPRESENT A NEW TECHNOLOGY DESIGNED TO HELP SMOKERS PROGRESSIVELY REDUCE NICOTINE INTAKE. THIS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY FACILITATE THE QUITTING PROCESS WHEN INTEGRATED WITH ADDITIONAL SMOKING CESSATION STRATEGIES. PRELIMINARY WORK STRONGLY SUGGESTS THAT THE FILTERS SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE SMOKE EXPOSURE (DATA HAVE BEEN OBTAINED FROM BOTH LABORATORY AND CLINICAL CONTEXTS). THE FILTERS ALSO APPEAR TO OVERCOME SEVERAL SERIOUS PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH TRADITIONAL BRAND-SWITCHINGPROCEDURES. A MINIMUM OF 60 SUBJECTS (6 GROUPS) WILL BE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER NICOTINE FADERS OR BRAND SWITCHING. GROUPS WILL FOLLOW A SMOKING CESSATION CLINIC PROCEDURE. RECYCLING OF INITIAL RELAPSERS WILL ALSO BE ENCOURAGED.

BETTER METHODS OF REMOVING THESE VAPORS FROM AIR ARE REQUIRED. THIS PROPOSAL DESCRIBES THE TREATMENT OF THESE VAPORS THROUGH THE USE OF COMPOSITE MEMEBRANES EXTREMELY PERMEABLE TO THE VAPOR BUT RELATIVELY IMPERMEABLE TO AIR. SIMILAR MEMBRANES HAVE ALREADY BEEN DEVELOPED AT MEMBRANE TECHNOLOGY AND RESEARCH , INC. (MTR) FOR THE REMOVAL OF ORGANIC EMISSIONS FROM I INDUSTRIAL AIR STREAMS. THE MEMBRANE SYSTEMS CAN BE MADE QUITE COMPACT AND LIGHT, WEIGHT. EXISTING TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS 100 FT (3)/MIN OF AIR TO BE DEACTIVATED BY A UNIT WITH A VOLUME OF 20 TO 30 FT (3) POWERED BY A 15 TO 20 HP MOTOR. DEVELOPMENT OF MORE EFFICIENT MEMBRANES AND MODULES WOULD ALLOW MORE COMPACT, LIGHT WEIGHT, AND ENERGY EFFICIENT UNITS TO BE BUILT. UNLIKE CARBON ABSORPTION SYSTEMS MEMBRANE UNITS ARE CAPABLE OF CONTINUOUS ANATTENDED OPERATION AND DO NOT REQUIRED PERIODIC REPLACEMENT OR REGENRATION OFTHE ABSORPT ION BED. IN THIS PHASE I PROGRAM, THE FEASIBILITY OF THE PROCESS WITH MEMBRANES SELECTED FOR THIS SEPARATION WOULD BETESTED. SMALL SPIRAL WOUND MEMBRANE MODULES WOUD BE USED.",

THE PRESENT PROCESS UTILIZES A DISCRETE OXIDELAYER FORMED BY DIFFUSION AND AN ACCUMULATION OF OXIDE-FORMING ELEMENTS FROM THE BULK OF THE METAL CASTING TOTHE PORCELAIN INTERFACE. THE ALTERNATE TECHNIQUE PROPOSED HERE INVOLVES THE MAGNETRON SPUTTER-DEPOSITION OF LAYER WITH A GRADIENT OXYGENCOMPOSITION THAT SHOULD HAVE SUPERIOR BONDING TO BOTH THE CERAMIC AND METAL COMPONENTS. THE GRADIENT WILL BE ACHIEVED BY SLOWLY VARYING THE GAS COMPOSITION DURING SPUTTERING FROM ARGON TO OXYGEN. THIS WILL RESULT IN A SMOOTH COMPOSITIONAL TRANSITION AND MAY PROVIDE A REDUCTION IN THE UNDESIRABLE RESIDUAL TENSILE STRESSES THAT OCCUR AT SOME PORCELAINMETAL INTERFACES DUE TO THE DIFFERENCE IN THE THERMAL CONTRACTION COEFFICIENTS. THE USE OF THIS PROCEDURE MAY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE PORCELAIN-METAL BONDSTRENGTH, PARTICULARLY WITH BASE METAL CASTING ALLOYS, AND IT SHOULD BE LESS TECHNIQUE-SENSITIVE THAN CURRENT DENTAL LABORATORY PROCEDURES.",

WE WILL STUDY PROMISING TECHNIQUES FOR GENERATING MONOPULSE BEAMS WHICH COULD BE USED TO ILLUMINATE A MILLIMETER APERTURE ANTENNA. BASED ON THE OUTCOME OF THE INITIAL ANALYSIS, OPTIMIZATION OF A SELECTED MONOPULSE PROCESSOR IN TERMS OF COMPACTNESS, BEAM OVERLAP, AND SYSTEM CONFIGURATION WILL BE CARRIED OUT. THIS EFFORT WILL BE PRIMARILY BASED ON NUMERICAL DIFFRACTION CALCULATIONS COUPLED WITH GAUSSIAN MODE ANALYSIS AND SUPPLEMENTED BY RAY TRACING WHERE APPROPRIATE. EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE WITH BEAM WAVEGUIDE SYSTEM HAS SUGGESTED THE CONFIGURATION OF SEVERAL OPTICAL MONOPULSE PROCESSORS WHICH WILL BE THE SUBJECT OF DETAILED ANALYSIS DURING THIS PROGRAM. THE PHASE SHIFTPROPERTIES OF CRITICAL QUASIOPTICAL COMPONENTS ARE DIRECT RESULTS OF BASIC EM THEORY, WHICH IS ONE CRUCIAL ADVANTAGE OF THIS PROPAGATION MEDIUM.

USE OF MILLIMETER WAVES OVERCOMES MOST OF THE SHORT-COMINGS OF EXISTING ULTRASONIC AND INFRARED SENSORS. MILLIMETER WAVE SENSORS ARE ABLE TO OPERATE IN SUCH ADVERSE ENVIRONMENTS AS SMOKE, DUST, CHEMICAL SMOG, FOG, SNOW, ETC., WHICH BLIND MOST INFRARED AND VISUAL SYSTEMS. MILLIMETER WAVES, UNLIKE ULTRASOUND WAVES, ARE ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES, AND THUS ARE QUITE INSENSITIVE TO CHANGING TEMPERATURE AND OTHER PROPERTIES OF THE ENVIRONMENT. MILLIMETER WAVE SENSORS CAN BE MADE 1001000 TIMES SMALLER THAN COMPARABLE MICROWAVE SENSORS. MILLIMETER WAVE TECHNOLOGY, PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF LOW-COST, HIGH-PERFORMANCE ASSEMBLIES, HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES RECENTLY, SO THAT IT IS NOW ENTIRELY PRACTICAL TO MAKE INEXPENSIVE SENSORS OF THE TYPE PROPOSED. HYBRID MILLIMETER WAVE INTEGRATED CIRCUITS WILL ALLOW, IN PRODUCTION QUANTITIES, COSTS OF ONLY SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS PER SENSOR MODULE, MAKING SUCH HIGH-PERFORMANCE SENSORS VERY COST-EFFECTIVE. IN PHASE I,WE PROPOSE A SET OF DESIRED SPECIFICATIONS IN CONSULTATION WITH THE END USERS, AND BUILD A BRASSBOARD SENSOR TO TEST CERTAIN ALGORITHMS AND SYSTEM OPTIONS.

SALVAGE FUZING OF INTERCEPTED WARHEADS COULD PRODUCE NUCLEAR EXPLOSIONS AT THESE ALTITUDES. KNOWLEDGE OF THE RESULTING NUCLEAR ENVIRONMENT CAN BE USED TO IMPROVE SDI SYSTEMS PERFORMANCE. FOR BURST ALTITUDES AROUND 1500 KM, EXPANDING DEBRIS IS EXPECTED TO SLOW PREDOMINATELY BY MAGNETIC FORCES. THEORETICAL UNDERSTANDING OF NUCLEAR BURSTS IN THIS MAGNETIC CONFINEMENT REGIME IS VERY LIMITED BECAUSE EXISTING TEST DATA IS AT MUCH LOWER ALTITUDES. STUDY OF DEBRIS EXPANSION HERE COULD BE PURSUED VIA AN AXISYMMETRIC, THREE DIMENSIONAL, HYBRID (ELECTRON FLUID/ION PARTICLES) CODE TO EXAMINE WAVE-PARTICLE INSTABILITIES, IN COMBINATION WITH A PROCEDURE FOR INCLUDING THEIR EFFECTS IN FASTER MHD FLUID-LIKE CALCULATIONS. TO PREPARE GROUNDWORK FOR SUCH STUDY, THE PHASE I OBJECTIVES ARE: (1) TO ESTIMATE PHYSICAL PARAMETER RANGES VIA MHD CALCULATION OF THE MAGNETIC BUBBLE SHAPE AND TIME TO ITS MAXIMUM EXPANSION; (2) TO DESIGN AN AXISYMMETRIC HYBRID PLASMA TREATMENT AND DETERMINE LIMITS ON APPLICABILITY TO COUPLING SHELL EXPANSION; AND (3) TO EXAMINE THE PRACTICALITY OF A TRUNCATED MOMENT METHOD FOR INCLUDING WAVEPARTICLE EFFECTS IN MHD APPROACHES.",

THE APPROACH IS BASED ON APHYSICAL PROPERTY CALLED MAGNETOSTRICTION THAT TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE VOLUME CHANGES IN MAGNETIC MATERIALS. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THE PROJECT ARE TO DEVELOP A LABORATORYPROTOTYPE FOR MAGNETOSTRICTIVE MEASUREMENT OF URETHRAL PRESSURE PROFILES (PHASE I) AND TO MAKE IN VIVO MEASUREMENTSWITH HUMAN SUBJECTS (PHASE II). THE METHODOLOGY FOR PHASE IINVOLVES CONSTRUCTING A WORKING PROTOTYPE DEVICE FOR LABORATORY EXPERIMENTATION AND MAKING IN VITRO MEASUREMENTS WITH THIS PROTOTYPE IN AN ARTIFICIAL URETHRA UNDER SIMULATED HUMAN CONDITIONS. THE INNOVATIVE ASPECTS OF THE RESEARCH LIE IN THE NOVEL APPLICATION OF THE MAGNETOSTRICTIVE PROPERTY AND IN THE REALIZATION OF AN INSTRUMENT THAT WILL MEASURE URETHRAL PRESSURE WITHOUT INTRODUCING THE ARTIFACTS THAT TRADITIONAL MEASURING TECHNIQUES PRODUCE DUE TO CANAL IRRITATION AND TRANSDUCER TWISTING AND MISPOSITIONING.",

RECENT ATTEMPTS AT DEVELOPING AN EFFECTIVE CONTRAST AGENT TO MEASURE MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION HAVE RESULTED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MICROBUBBLES, UNSTABLE PREPARATIONS OF AIR TRAPPED IN FLUID WHICH SERVE AS HIGHLY ECHOGENIC MEDIA. CLINICAL UTILITY OF CONTRAST ULTRASONOGRAPHY FOR MEASURING BLOOD FLOW IS CRITICALLY DEPENDENT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF STABLE MICROBUBBLES THAT ARE SMALL ENOUGH FOR UNHINDERED CAPILLARY PASSAGE FOR INTRAVENOUS INJECTION. THE PHASE I GOAL IS TO DEVELOP REPRODUCIBLE, STABLE, SMALL, AIR-TRAPPED SPHERES TO SERVE AS A PERFUSION CONTRAST AGENT. THE AGENT WILL OPTIMALLY CONSIST OF 2.0-MICRON-DIAMETER, AIR-TRAPPED SPHERES, WHICH WILL BE TESTED FOR SHELF-LIFE AND ECHOGENIC PROPERTIES. WHEN STABLE PREPARATIONS ARE MADE, TESTS WILL BE PERFORMED BOTH IN VITRO AND IN VIVO TO DEMONSTRATE CONTRAST EFFICACY. THE RESULTS OF PHASE I WILL SERVE AS A BASIS DURING PHASE II TO PERFORM FULL TOXICITY TESTING IN RODENTS AND DOGS. AFTER SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF TOXICITY TESTING, AN INVESTIGATIONAL NEW DRUG (IND) APPLICATION WILL BE FILED AND CLINICAL EVALUATION PERFORMED TO OBTAIN FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION APPROVAL. SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF A STABLE ULTRASOUND CONTRAST AGENT WILL HAVE WIDE APPLICABILITY, NOT ONLY IN MONITORING CARDIAC PERFUSION BUT ALSO IN THE ASSESSMENT OF TISSUE PERFUSION IN OTHER ANATOMIC SITES.",

THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP AN EVEN MORE EFFECTIVE AGENT OF THIS TYPE. SPECIFICALLY, MOLECULES FOR HEALTH, INC. WILL ADD SUBSTITUENTS TO KNOWN ACTIVE STRUCTURES IN SEVEN CLASSES OF POLYHYDROXYPHENYL COMPOUNDS TO ENHANCE BINDING ON THE ENZYME. STRUCTURAL REQUIREMENTS FOR OPTIMUM ACTIVITY WILL BE EVALUATED. TO OCCOMPLISH THIS,MOLECULES FOR HEALTH, INC. WILL MEASURE THE DEGREE OF ENZYMEINHIBITION, THE RATE OF FREE RADICAL SCAVENGING (MECHANISM OF INHIBITION), AND THE ANTITUMOR ACTIVITY IN THE L1210 LEUKEMIA MODEL. ADDITIONALLY, THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTEWILL BE PROVIDED WITH ADEQUATE QUANTITIES OF THE MOST PROMISING COMPOUNDS FOR FURTHER ANTITUMOR TESTING. AN IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF STRUCTURAL FEATURES WILL GIVE DIRECTION TO FURTHER DEVELOPMENT. SUCCESSFUL COMPOUNDS RESULTING FROM PHASE I WILL UNDERGO PHARMACOKINETICS AND TOXICOLOGICAL EVALUATION IN PHASE II.",

THE TECHNOLOGY MIMICS THE HUMAN AUDITORY LOCALIZATION SYSTEM, BY COMPUTER EMULATION OF THE NATURAL BINAURAL AUDITORY SIGNAL PROCESSING (BIONIC EMULATION). AN OUTGROWTH OF THE TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN THE RESEARCH INTOTHE USE OF SUBAUDIBLE SOUND (INFRASONIC SOUND) AS A MEANS TO BOTH BROADEN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THREE-DIMENSIONAL AUDITORY DISPLAYS AND PROVIDE OTHER COMPLEX SITUATION INFORMATION. AS A RESULT, THE TECHNOLOGY WILL DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE OPERATOR TO COMPLEX SYSTEM INTERFACE BY PROVIDING AN EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF INFORMATION TRANSFER TO THE BRAIN IN A MANNER THAT BOTH AUGMENTS AND COMPLEMENTS THE OPERATOR'S VISUAL PERCEPTION SYSTEM. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE IN SIMULATORS WHERE, THE OPERATOR IS BROUGHT MORE DEEPLY INTO THE SIMULATION BECAUSE MORE OF THE SENSES ARE INVOLVED. FURTHER, EFFECTIVE THREE-DIMENSIONAL SOUNDS WILL HELP MASK THE UNWANTED SIMULATOR SOUNDS CAUSED FROM THE SIMULATOR MACHINERY ITSELF.",

THE MICROSTRUCTURE OF EACH MATERIAL WILL BE CHARACTERIZED IN DETAIL BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER LASER TESTING. MICROSCALE TESTING WILL BE PERFORMED USING LOCAL AREA HEATING OF TEST SPECIMENS IN VACUUM TO STUDY VAPORIZATION PHENOMENA AND IN BOTH LOW OXYGEN PARTIAL PRESSURES AND AIR TO STUDY OXIDATION PRODUCT SPECIES AND COMBINED OXIDATION/VAPORIZATION REACION PHENOMENA. ON-LINE LASER PROBE SPECTROMETRY WILL BE USED TO PROVIDE REAL-TIME DETERMINATION OF CHEMICAL SPECIES PRESENT AT TEMPERATURE IN THE NEAR-SURFACE ENVIRONMENT. THE OBSERVED PHENOMENA WILL CORRELATE WITH MICROSTRUCTURAL AND MICROCHEMICAL CHANGES DISCERNED FROM PREAND POST-TEST CHARACTERIZATION OF THE MODEL MATERIALS. THEORETICAL MODELING OF THERMOCHEMICAL PROCESSES EXPECTED TO OCCUR AT THESE TEMPERATURES WILL BE COMPARED TO OBSERVED VAPORIZATION/OXIDATION SPECIES. THE DEVELOPEDTEST METHOD SHOULD BE USEFUL AS A MATERIALS DEVELOPMENT AND SCREENING TOOL AND MAY ALSO BE USEFUL FOR PREDICTION OF LONG-TERM HOT CORROSION BEHAVIOR FROM KNOWLEDGE OF THE BASIC REACTION INVOLVED.

PROPOSES TO COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT OF IMPLANTABLE ELECTRICAL DEVICES DESIGNED TO SUPPRESS CHRONIC HIGH-TONE TINNITUS, WHILE CONSERVING RESIDUAL HEARING ACROSS THE SPEECH FREQUENCY RANGE. DEVELOPMENT OF THIS DEVICE IS BASED UPON OBSERVATIONS WITH COCHLEAR IMPLANTPATIENTS STUDIED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT SAN FRANCISCO AND AT DUKE UNIVERSITY, AS WELL AS UPON ANIMAL STUDIES OF AUDITORY NERVE SUPPRESSION. THE FORMER STUDIES HAVE REVEALED THAT AN APPROPRIATELY STIMULATED COCHLEAR PROSTHESIS PROFOUNDLY SUPPRESSES TINNITUS. BOTH SERIES OF STUDIES INDICATE THAT TINNITUS CAN PROBABLY BE EFFECTIVELY SUPPRESSED WITH MINIMAL INTERFERENCE TO HEARING IN MORE REMOVED COCHLEAR REGIONS. IN THESE PROPOSED DEVICE-DEVELOPMENT STUDIES: (1) EXTRACOCHLEAR STIMULATION SITES EFFECTIVE FOR SUPPRESSING TINNITUS WILL BE DEFINED; (2) OPTIMUM ELECTRODE CONFIGURATIONS, STIMULUS FORMS, AND STIMULUS SEQUENCING WILLBE DEFINED FOR PRODUCING PROFOUND TINNITUS SUPPRESSION WITH MINIMAL-LEVEL AND MINIMUM-PERIOD STIMULATION; AND (3) MODELSOF SUPPRESSION INSTRUMENTS SUITABLE FOR APPLICATION IN AN INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE EXEMPTION (IDE) CLINICAL TRIAL WILL BE BUILT. THESE STUDIES SHOULD LEAD TO FINAL SPECIFICATION OF THE DESIGN OF A PRACTICAL TINNITUS INSTRUMENT, EFFECTIVE FOR A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM SEVERE, INTRACTABLE CHRONIC TINNITUS.",

THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF PHASE I ARE TO: (1) MODIFY THE EXISTING WEINSTEIN ORAL MICROAESTHESIOMETER TO CREATE A NEW INSTRUMENT, A CORNEAL MICROAESTHESIOMETER, FOR TESTING CORNEAL SOMATOSENSATION; (2) DEMONSTRATE VALIDITY AND TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; (3) DEVELOP NORMS ON ASMALL GROUP OF SUBJECTS; (4) EXPLORE THE FEASIBILITY OF OBTAINING CORTICAL EVOKED POTENTIALS; AND (5) EXPLORE, AS AVAILABLE IN THE SAMPLE, THE EFFECTS OF AGE, SEX, CONTACT LENSES, USE OF TOBACCO, AND USE OF ALCOHOL UPON CORNEAL THRESHOLDS. THE LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE IS TO ESTABLISH THE CORNEAL MICROAESTHESIOMETER TEST AS AN OFFICE PROCEDURE FOR SCREENING PATIENTS FOR: (1) SYSTEMIC, OCULAR, OR CORNEAL PROBLEMS; (2) FOR PREDICTING RECOVERY FROM SURGERY; AND (3) FOR EVALUATING IDEAL OPHTHALMIC DOSING ON AN INDIVIDUAL PATIENT BASIS. THE POTENTIAL EXISTS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CORNEAL AESTHESIOMETER THAT WILL NOT INJURE NEWLY TRANSPLANTED CORNEAS, THAT WILL NOT ELICIT APPREHENSION IN PATIENTS, AND THAT WILL GIVE VALID, PRECISE, AND RELIABLE TESTS. FURTHER, THE NEW CORNEAL AESTHESIOMETER COULD BE USED TO ELICIT CORTICAL EVOKED POTENTIALS FOR THE EVALUATION OF INFANTS OR OF MENTALLY IMPAIRED PATIENTS. IN ADDITION, THE FOLLOWING DISADVANTAGES OF CURRENT CORNEAL AESTHESIOMETERS WILL BE AVOIDED WITH THIS INSTRUMENT: (1) RISK OF TRANSMISSION OF INFECTION; (2) INABILITY TO DELIVER SUBTHRESHOLD STIMULATION; AND (3) INDUCING APPREHENSION IN THE PATIENT FROM A VISUALLY APPROACHING STIMULUS.",

THE PROPOSED RESEARCH DEVELOPS A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO UNDERSTANDING STRESS TOLERANCE. ALUMINUM TOXICITY HAS BEEN CHOSEN AS A MODEL STRESS. THIS PROPOSAL UTILIZES THE GENUS CERATOPTERIS AS AN EXPERIMENTAL PLANT SYSTEM AS WELL AS ALUMINUM TOLERANT AND SENSITIVE CULTIVARS OF SORGHUM. NPI HAS A LARGE NUMBER X-IRRADIATED MUTANTS OF CERATOPTERIS WHICH ARE A1 TOLERANT. THE ADVANTAGE OF UTILIZING CERATOPTERIS IS THAT MUTATIONS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED IN THE SINGLE CELL HAPLOID SPORE STAGE. AFTER GERMINATION, THE GAMETOPHYTES CAN BE SELFED TO PRODUCE COMPLETELY HOMOZYGOUS DIPLOID PLANTS. THE IDENTIFICATION OF THESE MUTATIONS SHOULD IDENTIFY THE GENES INVOLVED IN A1 TOLERANCE. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS APPROACH, NPI HAS PROPOSED TO IDENTIFY THE GENES INVOLVED IN A1 TOLERANCE BY SCREENING A CDNA LIBRARY FROM SORGHUM WITH POLYA+ RNA FROM A1 TOLERANT AND SENSITIVE CULTIVARS OF SORGHUM. THOSE SEQUENCES WHOSE TRANSCRIPTION IS AFFECTED (QUALITATIVELY OR QUANTITATIVELY) WILL BE IDENTIFIED AND STUDIED IN DEPTH.

NMI HAS OBTAINED ORPHAN DRUG STATUS FOR NA2B12H11SH AND PROPOSES TWO DIFFERENT QUANTITATIVE METHODS FOR MEASURING ITS PURITY: TRACK-ETCH/THIN-LAYER CHROMATOGRAPHY (TLC) AND HIGH-PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY (HPLC). THE FORMER METHOD ALLOWS THE SENSITIVE MEASUREMENT OF THE (10)B ISOTOPEIN THE BORON POLYHEDRON. MEASUREMENT BY HPLC IS BASED ON ANALYSIS OF THE SULFHYDRYL GROUP ON B12H11SH(2)- BY ELECTRO-CHEMICAL OR OTHER MEANS. THE TECHNIQUES THUS COMPLEMENT ONE ANOTHER AND CAN BE SYMBIOTICALLY APPLIED TO BOTH CHEMICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF BORON-CARRIER COMPOUNDS.",

FROM PAST WORK, IT IS KNOWN THAT THE ABOVE DESCRIBED URETHANECARBONATE COPOLYMERS HAVE VERY HIGH IMPACT RESISTANCE WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR THE PRODUCTION FOR GOGGLES FOR EYE PROTECTION. ALSO, THESE PLASTIC SUBSTANCES HAVE MUCH BETTER ABRASION RESISTANCE THAN THE \"POLYCARBONATE\" PRESENTLY USED IN LENSES. PAST TESTING HAS ALSO SHOWN THAT THE ABOVE URETHANE-CARBONATE COPOLYMER SYSTEMS HAVE OUTSTANDING DURABILITY. IN FACT THE SYSTEMS SHOW THE UNIQUE PROPERTY OF SIMULTANEOUSLY HAVING HIGH HYDROLITIC STABILITY AND HIGH OXIDATIVE RESISTANCE. BY THE PRESENT PROPOSED PROJECT, A SERIES OF THE ABOVE DESCRIBED URETHAN-CARBONATE COPOLYMERS WOULD BE SYNTHESIZED AND SCREEN TESTED.",

THE OVERALL AIM OF THIS PROPOSED PROJECT IS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION TECHNOLOGY FOR DETECTION OF ONCOGENE RNAS IN THESE FIXED TISSUES. PHASE I WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THAT N-MYC EXHIBITS BOTH ELEVATED RNA EXPRESSION AND AMPLIFIED GENE COPY NUMBER IN NEUROBLASTOMA; NEUROEPITHELIOMA WILL SERVE AS A NEGATIVE CONTROL. TOGETHER THEY PROVIDE A STANDARDIZED SYSTEM TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF VARIOUS IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION CONDITIONS. FRESH TUMOR TISSUE WILL BE OBTAINED BY PROPAGATING HUMAN CELL LINES IN NUDE MICE. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ANTICIPATED PROBLEM WILL BE SENSITIVITY. THE USE OF RNA RATHER THAN DNA PROBES WILL ALLOW FOR A POSTHYBRIDIZATION RNASE TREATMENT TO REDUCE BACKGROUNDS AND PERMIT DETECTION OF RNA EXPRESSION AT VERY LOW LEVELS IN INDIVIDUAL CELLS. MANY OF THE CURRENT STEPS FOR IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION TO FROZEN SECTIONS AND CYTOSPINS DO NOT GIVE OPTIMUM RESULTS WITH FIXED, PARAFFIN-EMBEDDED SECTIONS. THE VARIOUS TREATMENTS WORK INTERACTIVELY TO GIVE AND OVERALL SENSITIVITY LEVEL; THEREFORE, A MULTIDIMENSIONAL ARRAY OF TISSUE AND SLIDE TREATMENTS WILL BE EXAMINED TO MAXIMIZE SENSITIVITY.",

TO DEMONSTRATE THE OPTICAL SENSOR CONCEPT, A PRESURE SENSOR WILL BE DESIGNED AND FABRICATED FOR APPLICATION IN THE EMP/EMI, HIGH-TEMPERATURE CONDITIONS OF TURBINE ENGINE TEST INSTRUMENTATION. THE SENSOR CONSISTS OF A BROADBAND LIGHT SOURCE COUPLED INTO AN OPTICAL FIBER WHICH TRANSMITS THIS BROADBAND SPECTRUM TO THE REMOTE SENSOR ELEMENT. THE SENSOR ELEMENT IS A VARIABLE GAP FABRYPEROT CAVITY WHICH MODULATES THE REFLECTED SPECTRUM ACCORDING TO GAP DIMENSION. THE REFLECTED SPECTRUM IS FIBER-TRANSMITTED BACK TO A MICROPROCESSOR BASED, COLOR DEMODULATION SYSTEM. THIS COLOR DEMODULA-TION IS ACCOMPLISHED BY PRISM DISPERSION OVER A CHARGE-COUPLED-DEVICE (CCD).

OPTRA HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT IN THE INFRA-RED PART OF THE SPECTRUM A METROLOGY SYSTEM BASED UPON A 2FREQUENCY-HENE LASER CAN BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE FOR THIS PURPOSE. SUCH A LASER, IN EFFECT SIMULATES A CONSTANT, CONTINUOUS AND HIGH DIFFERENTIAL MIRROR VELOCITY WITH A VELOCITY DETERMINED BY THE LASER DIFFERENCE, BEAT OR HETERODYNE FREQUENCY. THIS MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO MEASURE MIRROR POSITION, TRAVEL AND TILT AT A RATE VIRTUALLY INDEPENDENT OF MIRROR SCAN VELOCITY AND/OR DIRECTION. OPTRA PROPOSES TO DEMONSTRATE THAT BY OPTIMIZING CAPTURE RANGE, ELECTRICAL BANDWIDTH AND RADIOMETRY THE SAME SYSTEM CAN BE APPLIED TO A VERY SHORT WAVELENGTH INTERFEROMETER AND MAINTAIN MIRROR ALIGNMENT TO THE REQUISITE SMALL FRACTION OF A WAVELENGTH.

IT IS THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL TO INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF TWO NEW CLASSES OF HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGING DETECTORS (MULTI-ANODE MICROCHANNEL ARRAY (MAMA) DEVICES AND DIGICON TUBES THAT WILL FIND APPLICATIONS IN SEVERAL OF THE ABOCE-MENTIONED AREAS. THESE DEVICES EMPLOY PHOTOCATHODES AND EITHER MICROCHANNEL-PLATE OR ELECTRON BEAM BOMBARDED SILICON TECHNOLOGY TO ACHIEVE HIGH INTERNAL GAIN. HOWEVER, THE PROPOSED HIGH-RESOLUTION DEVICES DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM CURRENTLY AVAILABLE DEVICES IN THAT THE NEW DEVICES EMPLOY A NOVEL HIGH-RESOLUTION (-400 ANODES/MM) BAKEABLE, MULTI-ANODE FEEDTHROUGH PLATE TO TRANSFER IMAGE-WISE ELECTRONIC CHARGE DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE INSIDE TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE EVACUATED DEVICE HOUSING. THIS NEW FEEDTHROUGH PLATE TECHNOLOGY IS EXPECTED TO SOLVE SEVERAL OFTHE MANUFACTURING AND OPERATING PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH IMAGE-CONVERTER TUBES, AND THEREFORE PERMIT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS NEW FAMILY OF LOW-COST, HIGH RESOLUTION MAMA DETECTORS AND DIGICONS. THE MULTI-ANODE FEEDTHROUGH PLATE IS ALSO EXPECTED TO FACILITATE THE BUMP BONDING OF THESE HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGING DETECTORS TO SEMICONDUCTOR CHIPS (E.G. CCDS). THE AVAILABILITY OF SUCH LOW-COST, HIGH PERFORMANCE DEVICES IS EXPECTED TO LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT ADVANCES IN SEVERAL OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED AREAS OF ASTRONOMICAL RESEARCH.",

WITH THOSE TOOLS IN HAND OTISCA IS CONVINCED THAT AN ANTHRACITE/WATER SLURRY CAN BE DEVELOPED WHICH WILL HAVE ECELLENT STORAGE AND RHEOLOGICAL PROPERTIES AND WILL BE CAPABLE OF MAINTAINING STABLE COMBUSTION IN A SMALL INDUSTRIAL BOILER SUCH AS THE EXISTING 75 HORSEPOWER FIRE-TUBE BOILER THAT WILL BE USED IN THIS RESEARCH PROGRAM. THE PROPOSED PROGRAM CONSISTS OF FIVE TASKS WHICH INCLUDE THE PREPARATION OF TWO SLURRIES: ONE WITH A PARTICLE DIAMETER IN THE RANGE OF 150UMXO AND THE OTHER 20UMXO; AND AN IN DEPTH DEVELOPMENT OF THE RHEOLOGY OF THOSE ANTHRACITE/WATER SLURRIES CONSISTENT WITH OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE SPECIFICATIONS WHICH ARE NECESSARY FOR STORAGE AND ATOMIZATION. WITH THE SPECIFICATIONS IN HAND, AN IN-HOUSE PILOT PLANT WILL PRODUCE ABOUT 1000 LBS (DRY) OF EACH ANTHRACITE/WATER SLURRY FOR COMBUSTION TESTING IN THE EXISTING FIRE-TUBE BOILER TO ESTABLISH THE COMBUSTION EFFICIENCY OF THAT FUEL.

PRESENT COOLING TECHNIQUES CANNOT MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS AND THE DRIVE TOWARDS HIGH FUNCTIONAL DENSITY IS TODAY CONSTRAINED BY AVAILABLE THERMAL DESIGN AND HEAT REMOVAL TECHNIQUES. THEREFORE, THERE EXISTS AN URGENT NATIONAL NEEDTO ESTABLISH COOLING TECHNOLOGY FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF SUPERCOMPUTERS. A NOVEL COOLING CONCEPT BASED ON DROPLET IMPINGEMENT HEAT TRANSFER THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO INCREASE THE HEAT FLUX RATES THAT CAN BE ACHIEVED BY AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE OR MORE OVER PRESENT COOLING TECHNOLOGIES IS PROPOSED. PHASE I OF THIS PROJECT WILL SUMMARIZE PREVIOUS WORK AND FORMULATE PRELIMINARY ANALYSES TO ESTIMATE THE EXPECTED PERFORMANCE BOUNDS AND IDENTIFY THE GAPS IN PRESENT UNDERSTANDING OF THEPROCESS. BASIC RESEARCH TO ADVANCE THE SCIENCE OF DROPLET IMPINGEMENT COOLING WOULD BE PERFORMED IN PHASE II.",

A LARGE PORTION OF THE EARTH'S PRECIPITATION FALLS OVER THE OCEANS; THEREFORE, IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR UNDERSTANDING GLOBAL CLIMATE TO HAVE ACCURATE MEASUREMENTS OF RAINFALL OVER LARGE WATER AREAS. A DEVICE WILL BE DEVELOPED TO MEASURE RAINFALL ACCURATELY BYUSING UNDERWATER ACOUSTIC SIGNALS. THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF THIS DEVICE IS DIGITAL PROCESSING OF THE UNDERWATER ACOUSTICSIGNAL GENERATED BY RAINFALL TO DETERMINE ITS INTENSITY. THE PRINCIPLE HAS BEEN DERIVED THEORETICALLY AND DEMONSTRATED EXPERIMENTALLY. HOWEVER, THERE ARE IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS IN THE METHOD USED, AND IT IS PLANNED IN THIS PROJECT TO ESTABLISH MORE SOPHISTICATED SIGNAL-PROCESSING TECHNIQUES TO OVERCOME THESE LIMITATIONS. SPECIFICALLY, OUR GOAL IS TO IMPROVE SIGNIFICANTLY THE ACCURACY OF THE MEASUREMENTS: WHEREAS THE ACTUAL STATE OF THE ART YIELDS RAINFALL RATE ESTIMATES WITHIN A FACTOR OF 2 OF THE ACTUAL VALUE, THE GOAL OF PHASE I IS TO SHOW THE FEASIBILITY OF SIGNAL PROCESSING TECHNIQUES THAT WILL YIELD ESTIMATES WITH MEASUREMENT ERRORS NO GREATER THAN 20%. THE FEASIBILITY STUDY WILL INCLUDE THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL WORK.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOLU- TION OVER A REAL TIME PATH OR ITERATIVE PROCESS (FALSE TIME PATH) REQUIRES THE MESH NODES TO MOVE DYNAMICALLY IN THE PROPER POSITION AT EACH ITERATION OR INSTANCE OF TIME. AL- THOUGH A NUMBER OF METHODS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO GENERATE SOLUTION ADAPTIVE MESHES, EACH OF THEM HAS AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLOWING SHORTCOMINGS: (1) POSSIBILITY OF GRID ENTANGLE-MENT EVEN IN 2-D, (2) LACK OF GRID CONTROL PRECISION, OR (3)BASICALLY 1-D CHARACTER OF GRID ADAPTION. THUS, INNOVATIVE GRID GENERATORS ARE NEEDED. THE PROPOSED APPROACH TO ADA- TIVE GRID GENERATION IS BASED ON A NOVEL IDEA WHICH HAS A SOLID MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION. THE INTERDEPENDENCE OF THE SPACE MATRIC STRUCTURE AND SOME MEASURE OF NUMERICAL ERROR IN THIS SPACE IS ASSUMED. THE POWERFUL MATHEMATICAL APPARATUS OF HARMONIC MAPS PROVIDES THE GRID GENERATING EQUATIONS AMENABLE TO EFFICENT NUMERICAL SOLUTION.

THE CONSEQUENCES ARE A COMPOSITE MATERIAL SYSTEM WITH MAJOR LIMITATIONS DUE TO LOW INTERFACIAL SHEAR AND TRANSVERSE TENSILE STRENGTHS. THE CONVERSION OF CARBON/PHENOLIC INTO A CARBON/CARBON MATERIAL FURTHER REDUCES INTERFACIAL BOND STRENGTHS. THIS LIMITS THE STRUCTURAL USAGES OF CARBON/CARBON BECAUSE OF VERY LOW OFF-AXIS MECHANICAL PROPERTIES. PLASMA TREATMENT PROCESSES UTILIZING AMMONIA AS A SOURCE GAS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE CAPABILITY OF ESTABLISHING REACTIVE AMINE GROUPS ON ARAMID AND CARBON FIBERS WHICH CAN FORM COVALENT BONDS WITH EPOXY RESINS. MECHANICAL TESTING OF THE PLASMA-TREATED ARAMID/EPOXY COMPOSITES HAVE DEMONSTRATED MAJOR INCREASES IN OFF-AXIS MECHANICAL PROPERTIES AND RESISTANCE TO MOISTURE ABSORPTION, CONFIRMING THE STRENGTHENING OF INTERFACIAL BONDS. THE FEASIBILITY OF IMPROVING THE INTERFACIAL BOND STRENGTH OF A CARBON/PHENOLIC COMPOSITE THROUGH A PLASMA TREATMENT PROCESS WILL BE INVESTIGATED.

THE MAJOR LIMITATION IN THESE TYPES OF APPLICATIONS (E.G., FLYWHEELS) IS THE LOW TRANSVERSE TENSILE STRENGTH OF THE COMPOSITE, A CONSEQUENCE OF THE EXTREMELY LOW INTERFACIAL ADHESIVE STRENGTH BETWEEN THE ORGANIC FIBER AND THE RESIN MATRIX. THIS RESULTS IN DELAMINATION AND FRAYING, NEGATING THE USEFUL CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS COMPOSITE. A SURFACE CHEMICAL MODIFICATION PROCESS HAS BEEN DEVELOPED FOR ORGANIC FIBERS WHICH RESULTS IN COVALENT BONDING BETWEEN THE FIBER AND EPOXY RESINS. SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN INTERFACIAL ADHESION RESULT. TRANSVERSE TENSIL STRENGTHS APPROACHING 4000 PSI HAVE ALREADY BEEN ACHIEVED IN KEVLAR 49/EPOXY LAMINATES. THIS INCREASE IN TRANSVERSE STRENGTH PROPERTIES IS DIRECTLY TRANSLATABLE INTO INCREASED ENERGY STORAGE CAPABILITY. THE SURFACE CHEMICAL MODIFICATION PROCESS WILL BE APPLIED TOPOLYETHYLENE FIBERS FOR FABRICATION INTO UNIDIRECTIONAL EPOXY COMPOSITES. TRANSVERSE TENSILE STRENGTHS WILL BE MEASURED AS A FUNCTION OF THE SURFACE CHEMICAL MODIFICATION TREATMENT CONDITIONS.

CONTRIBUTING FACTORS INCLUDE POOR MATCHING OF SURFACE ENERGETICS COMPONENTS, THEREBY REDUCING SECONDARY BONDING FORCES, AND NON-REACTIVITY, PREVENTING COVALENT BOND FORMATION. POLYARAMID/THERMOSET RESIN COMPOSITES HAVE FACED SIMILAR PROBLEMS. SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENTS IN INTERFACIAL BOND STRENGTH HAVE BEEN OBTAINED BY DEPOSITING REACTIVE GROUPS ON FIBER SURFACES THROUGH A GLOW DISCHARGE PLASMA PROCESS. WITH REACTIONS TO THE THERMOSETTING RESIN, COVALENT BONDS ARE DEVELOPED, SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING FIBER/MATRIX ADHESION. IT APPEARS FEASIBLE TO ADAPT THIS PROCESS TO THERMOPLASTIC COMPOSITES, THE MAJOR MODIFICATION BEING THE SIMULTANEOUS MODIFICATION OF THE SURFACE CHEMISTRY OF FIBER AND MATRIX CONSTITUENTS. PLASMA TREATMENT PROCESSES FOR DIRECT REACTIONS TO PRODUCE COVALENT OR ACIDBASE BONDING ARE PROPOSED FOR INVESTIGATION AS ARE TWO-STEP REACTION PROCESSES CAPABLE OF COVALENT BONDING THROUGH THE USE OF AN INTERMEDIATE FUNCTIONARY BETWEEN THE PLASMA TREATED SURFACES.

RELATIVE TO COMMONLY UTILIZED TITANIUM ALLOYS, INCREASES IN SPECIFIC STIFFNESS OF 50 PERCENT WITH COMPARABLE SPECIFIC STRENGTH CAN BE OBTAINED. LIMITED HIGH TEMPERATURE TESTING HAS REVEALED THAT HIGH TEMPERATURE STRENGTH AND STIFFNESS IMPROVEMENTS ARE POSSIBLE WHILE EXTENDING THE OPERATING RANGE OF THE BASE ALLOY UP TO 100 DEG F.

THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP THE REQUIRED MATERIALS,REAGENTS, AND TECHNIQUES FOR THE LARGE-SCALE (0.4-MOLE) SOLID-PHASE SYNTHESIS OF RAT ATRIAL NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE (ANP), THE RECENTLY DISCOVERED HORMONE PRODUCED BY THE HEART. THE METHODS AND REAGENTS DEVELOPED FOR THE LARGE-SCALE SYNTHESIS OF THIS POLYPEPTIDE HORMONE WILL ALSO BE DIRECTLY APPLICABLE TO OTHER BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE PEPTIDES. INCREASING THE SIZE OF EACH BATCH IS THE ONLY WAY BY WHICH THE COST OF SYNTHETIC PEPTIDES CAN BE LOWERED. THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP THE MATERIALS AND PROCEDURES REQUIRED FOR THE ROUTINE PRODUCTION OF SYNTHETIC PEPTIDES ON THE KILOGRAM SCALE.

THE TREATMENT INVOLVES A VERY LOW-COST CHEMICAL REACTION WHICH CONVERTS THE HYDROXLIC AND CARBOXYLIC SURFACE FUNCTIONALITIES TO ETHERS AND ESTERS. THIS TREATMENT REDUCES THE PROTICITY OF THE SURFACE BUT DOES NOT INFLUENCE MUCH THE POLARIZABLE SURFACE FUNTIONALITIES. THEREFORE, WE EXPECT THAT IT WILL REDUCE SIGNIFICANTLY THE ADHERENCE AND SORPTION OF WATER TO THE SURFACE BUT WILL HAVE LITTLE OR NO EFFECT ON THE SORPTION OF WARFARE GASES. IN THIS PROJECT DIFFERENT SURFACE TREATMENTS WILL BE EXAMINED IN THE SPIRIT OF THE PATENT AND THEIR EFFECT ON THE SORPTION OF WARFARE GAS (WG) SIMULANTS WILL BE EXAMINED IN THE ABSENCE AND IN THE PRESENCE OF CONTROLLED AMOUNTS OF HUMIDITY.

TWO NEW DIAGNOSTIC METHODS, ENZYME IMMUNOASSAY AND IMMUNOFLUORESCENT ASSAYS, ARE PRESENTLY COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE BUT LACK EASE AND SPEED OF PERFORMANCE, AS THEY REQUIRE HIGHLY TRAINED INDIVIDUALS AND EXPENSIVE INSTRUMENTATION. PHOTEC DIAGNOSTICS, INC. HAS DEVELOPED A NOVEL ASSAY WHICH IS RAPID, INEXPENSIVE, AND EASY TO PERFORM. PRESENTLY THIS METHODOLOGY HAS BEEN APPLIED TO A SANDWICH APOPROTEIN A-1 TEST, WHICH UTILIZES A TABLET CONTAINING A COVALENTLY BOUND CAPTURE ANTIBODY AND A DYE-LABELED ANTIBODY. PHOTEC HAS DEVELOPED DYE POLYMER LABELS WHICH CAN POTENTIALLY INCREASE THE SENSITIVITY OF THE PROCEDURE TESTED WITH APOPROTEIN A-1 TO THE LEVEL NEEDED FOR CHLAMYDIA ANTIGEN. THE COMBINATION OF DYE POLYMER LABELS AND A TABLETED SOLID PHASE SUPPORT WHICH SPONTANEOUSLY SETTLES IN THE REACTION TUBE ALLOWS THE DEVELOPMENT OF INEXPENSIVE, RAPID DIAGNOSTICTESTS WHICH CAN BE READ IN \"TUBE\" PHOTOMETERS.",

IN THE LIQUID CRYSTAL MEDIUM THESE PARTICLES SPONTANEOUSLY ALIGN TO FORM SMALL CHAINS. THE MOTION OF THESE CHAINS AFFECTS THE LIQUID CRYSTAL OPTICAL PROPERTIES. THE DEVICE, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, MIMICS BACTERIA WHICH SENSE THE DIRECTION OF THE EARTH'S MAGNETIC FIELD. THE EFFECT OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD ON THE COMPOSITE OPTICAL MEDIUM CAN BE COUNTERBALANCED BY AN ELECTRIC FIELD SUCH THAT NO CHANGE IN OPTICAL PROPERTIES TAKES PLACE. THE VOLTAGE NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN THIS BALANCE IS A DIRECT MEASURE OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD STRENGTH. BECAUSE OF THIS BALANCING MECHANISM, THE MEASURED MAGNETIC FIELD STRENGTHS CAN BE QUITE LARGE OR SMALL, AND INTERFEROMETRIC METHODS CAN BE APPLIED TO ACHIEVE VERY HIGH SENSITIVITIES.

FOR THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH, POC HAS DEVISED A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT APPROACH TO DISCRIMINATING LASER SIGNALS FROM AMBIENT BACKGROUND BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE DEGREE OF COHERENCE OF THE INCIDENT LASER SIGNAL BESIDES ITS WELL-DEFINED WAVELENGTHS AND LINEWIDTHS. IN THIS CONCEPT, A SPECIAL COHERENCE HOLOGRAPHIC REFLECTING FILTER WILL BE FABRICATED THAT CAN DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN LIGHT SIGNALS OF DIFFERENT COHERENCE. THE NOVEL COHERENCE DISCRIMINATING REFLECTION (CDR) FILTERS FROM THIS RESEARCH ALSO REPRESENT A NEW CLASS OF HOLOGRAPHIC ELEMENTS FABRICATED USING PHOTOREFRACTIVE CRYSTALS (LITHIUM NIOBATE). IN ADDITION TO ENABLING MORE EFFECTIVE LASER DETECTION, THE CONCEPT IN THIS RESEARCH CAN ALSO LEAD TO A NEW SCHEME OF MULTICHANNEL SIGNAL MULTIPLEXING AND TRANSMISSION, NAMELY COHERENCE LENGTH MULTIPLEXING (CLM). ANALOGOUS TO WAVELENGTH DIVISION OR TIME DOMAIN MULTIPLEXING, CLM WHICH MAKES USE OF THE COHERENCE HOLOGRAPHIC FILTERS DEVELOPED IN THIS RESEARCH, WILL FIND APPLICATIONS IN FIBER OPTIC COMMUNICATIONS.",

THIS RESEARCH EFFORT PROPOSES TO USE ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES ON A MICROCOMPUTER FOR RAPID EVALUATION OF THE KEY PARAMETERS OVER A WIDE RANGE OF CONDITIONS. A KEY OBJECTIVE IS TO PROVIDE THIS CAPABILITY SUCH THAT THE CRITICAL END GAME ANALYSIS CAN BE PERFORMED EARLY IN THE EVOLUTION OF A WEAPON SYSTEM. THESE TECHNIQUES WILL FIRST USE RELATIVELY SIMPLE MODELS TO PREDICT DEPENDENCIES OF VARIOUS FUZING SCHEMES TO END GAME CONDITIONS.

MANY OF THESE SECONDARY PRODUCTS ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY AND AN ENORMOUS EFFORT HAS TO BE EXTENDED TO GET THEM. ATTEMPTS TO USE CELL CULTURES OF HIGHER PLANTS AS A MEANS OF PRODUCING SECONDARY PRODUCTS IN METHODS ANALOGOUS TO THOSE UTILIZING MICROBES HAVE LED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT IS UNECONOMICAL. IT IS NOW WELL RECOGNIZED THAT THE KEY TO TAPPING THE RESOURCE REPRESENTED BY PLANT CELLS IN CULTURE LIES IN THE ABILITY TO INDUCE THESE CELLS TO DIFFERENTIATE INTO THE KINDS OF CELLS OR TISSUES RESPONSIBLE FOR METABOLITE PRODUCTION IN THE INTACT PLANT. THE PROBLEM OF INDUCING SUCH DIFFERENTIATION IS COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT. IT REQUIRES A TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL ALLOW THE USE OF APPARATUS CAPABLE OF LARGE-SCALE SCREENING AND AUTOMATED TESTING OF PLANT CELLS AGAINST THE COMPLEX CHEMICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGIMES NECESSARY TO INDUCE DIFFERENTIATION. THIS RESEARCH IS AIMED AT THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SYSTEM FOR PRODUCTION OF HIGH-VALUE PLANT BIOCHEMICALS FROM CULTURED PLANT TISSUES WHICH TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE ZERO-G PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT FOR MANIPULATION OF DELICATE TISSUES AND FOR YIELD-ENHANCING CULTURE SEPARATION PROCESSES.",

FIRST, THE DEGRADING EFFECTS OF ENVIRONMENT AND THE GROSSLY DISSIMLAR CONDITIONS PREVAILING AT DIFFERENT LOCATIONS, IMPOSE A COMPLEX AND EXCEEDINGLY VARYING SET OF SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS. SECONDLY,THE CONTINUOUS, BROAD COVERAGE REQUIRED TO INSURE SECURITY, AS WELL AS THE LACK OF AUTOMATED ALARMS, LEAD TO A VARIETY OF DETECTION GAPS AND HEAVY DEPENDENCE ON TRAINED SENTRIES.

A NOVEL, SUPERSONIC, TWO-STAGE PLASMA REACTOR IS PLANNED FOR EFFICIENTLY PRODUCING HIGH DENSITY SILICON NITRIDE POWDER FROM SILANE AND AMMONIA. AMMONIA IS DISSOCIATED IN THE FIRST NOVEL REACTOR BY A HIGH CURRENT, LOW PRESSURE PLASMA, AND DISSOCIATED FRAGMENTS ARE INJECTED INTO THE SECOND STAGE THROUGH THE NOZZLE AT NEAR MARCH 1 VELOCITIES TO CONVERT THERMAL ENERGY OF THE FRAGMENTS INTO DIRECTED KINETIC ENERGY. A SECOND PLASMA REGION ACTIVATES THE REACTION BETWEEN THE ACTIVATED AMMONIA FRAGMENTS AND THE SILANE. THE LONG REACTION ZONE WILL FAVOR HOMOGENEOUS REACTIONS IN THE GAS PHASE AND NUCLEATION FAVORING THE FORMATION OF PARTICLES.

THIS IS EVIDENT IN THE INNOVATIVE METHODS AND MATERIAL CHOICES THAT HAVE BEEN SELECTED FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE AMMUNITION LOGISTICS PLANNERS. A MEANS OF ADAPTING PALLETS TO VARIOUS AMMUNITION CONTAINERS IS OF PRIME IMPORTANCE. RATHER THAN CONSIDERING THE HIGH COST OF A SPECIAL PALLET FOR EACH CONTAINER STYLE, AN ADAPTER, PRODUCED FROM HIGH STRENGTH POLYURETHANE RIM MOLDED MATERIAL WOULD ENABLE A FEW PALLET SIZES TO BE INTERCHANGABLE FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CONTAINER CONFIGURATIONS. A PALLET ADAPTER WOULD ALSO FACILITATE THE STACKING AND LOADING INTEGRITY. THE USE OF DURABLE, HIGH COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH, NON-SPARKING, MBC RESISTANT POLYURETHANE IS A VALID APPROACH TO THIS PROBLEM. THE PROPOSED PROGRAM IS DIRECTED TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT AND PROOF OF PRINCIPLE OF JUST SUCH A PALLET ADAPTER.",

APPLICABILITY ISSUES INCLUDE FIDELITY OF PHASE IMPRINT FROM A WEAK BEAM ONTO AN AMPLIFIED BEAM, NOISE ISSUES AND SCALABILITY. WAVE MIXING PROCESSES INCLUDE, BUT AR NOT LIMITED TO, TWO BEAM COUPLING, PARAMETRIC MIXING, UP-CONVERSION AND DOWN-CONVERSION MAY ALSO PROVE USEFUL AS NONLINEAR OPTICS PHASE PRESERVING AMPLIFIERS. THE END PRODUCT OF PHASE I WILL BE A CONCEPTUAL ANALYSIS AND COMPUTER MODEL OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SEVERAL KEY TECHNOLOGIES FOR OPTICAL AMPLIFICATION (INCLUDING MODELS OF PHASE AND IMAGE FIDELITY).",

NEWLY DEVELOPED HIB POLYSACCHARIDE-PROTEIN CONJUGATE VACCINES BEING TESTED ARE EFFECTIVE IN CHILDREN 2 MONTHS AND OLDER. HOWEVER, SOME INFANTS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO POLYSACCHARIDE ANTIGENS. A 15,000 DALTON PEPTIDOGLYCAN-ASSOCIATED LIPOPROTEIN (PAL), IDENTIFIED AS A POTENTIAL VACCINE CANDIDATE, HAS BEEN FOUND IN ALL HIB ISOLATES TESTED. IN ADDITION, IT IS ANTIGENICALLY CONSERVEDAMONG HIB STRAINS. THE 15K PAL CONSTITUTES 1.5 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL OMPS, MAKING IT DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE TO PURIFY COMMERCIALLY. THESE STUDIES WILL FACILITATE PRODUCTION OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF THE PROTEIN FOR USE AS A VACCINE. THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST USE OF A PROTEIN VACCINE AGAINST HIB DISEASE. THESE STUDIES WILL USE RECOMBINANT PLASMIDS THAT ENCODE THE PUTATIVE 15K-PAL GENE IN ESCHERICHIA COLI TO OVEREXPRESS THE GENE PRODUCT, UNDER THE CONTROL OF A REGULATABLE PROMOTER. IMMUNOGENICITY OF THE CLONED PROTEIN WILL BE EXAMINED USING BOTH BACTERICIDAL ASSAYS AND ANIMAL PROTECTION STUDIES. PHASE II STUDIES WILL DEVELOP PROCEDURES AMENABLE TO LARGE-SCALE PURIFICATION OF THE CLONED PROTEIN AND ADDITIONAL IMMUNOGENICITY TESTING.",

BECAUSE NO WIDELY ACCEPTED VACCINE IS AVAILABLE, THE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN FORCED TO RELY ON COCCIDIOSTAT DRUGS WHICHHAVE HISTORICALLY HAD LIMITED PERIODS OF EFFICACY. AS A RESULT, ADVANCED TECHNIQUES OF BIOTECHNOLOGY ARE BEING USED BY VARIOUS GROUPS TO IDENTIFY IMMUNODOMINANT COCCIDIAL PROTEINS AND THEIR ENCODING GENES IN EFFORTS TO DEVELOP VACCINES. THE STUDIES WILL CLASSIFY VARIOUS STRAINS OF SALMONELLA, ATTENUATED AS A RESULT OF AROA DELETION MUTATIONS, ACCORDINGTO THEIR TISSUE INVASIVENESS, INTESTINAL COLONIZING ABILITY,AND IMMUNOGENIC POTENTIAL. THE FEASIBILITY OF USING ONE OR MORE OF THESE STRAINS AS AN ORAL DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR FOREIGN ANTIGENS WILL BE ASSESSED USING AS A MODEL FOREIGN ANTIGEN THE NON-TOXIC BINDING SUBUNIT OF THE HEAT LABILE ENTEROTOXIN OF E.

THE RADIANT FLUX TO THE WORKPIECE WILL BE EXTREMELY UNIFORM, PRODUCING HIGHLY UNIFORM WORKPIECE TEMPERATURES. SHOULD SUCH A FURNACE BE USED IN A MICROGRAVITY ENVIRONMENT, THE ABSENCE OF CONVECTION WILL PRODUCE THE MOST UNIFORM HIGH TEMPERATURE HEATING AVAILABLE. THE COOL WALLS WILL ALLOW ITTO PRODUCE THESE CONDITIONS IN AN ULTRACLEAN ENVIRONMENT. THE UNITS WILL BE AVAILABLE FROM VERY SMALL SIZES (SCALE OFMILLIMETERS TO DELIVER INTENSE HEAT OVER VERY SMALL VOLUMES WITHOUT HEATING SURROUNDING VOLUMES) TO LARGE SIZES OF SCALES OF METERS FOR INDUSTRIAL USE. THEIR COST WILL BE MUCH LESS THAN THOSE OF OTHER FURNACES OF LESSER CAPABILITIES, AND AS A RESULT THEY WILL FACILITATE THE WORK OF HIGH TEMPERATURE SCIENTISTS WITH MODEST BUDGETS.

METHODS OF SYNTHESIS DIFFER RADICALLY WHETHER SOLUTION PHASE OR SOLID PHASE CHEMISTRY IS USED. THIS SBIR PROPOSAL DEALS WITH SOLID PHASE SYNTHESIS, WHILE A SEPARATE SBIR PROPOSAL IS BEING SUBMITTED ON SOLUTION PHASE CHEMISTRY. BOTH AIM AT IMPROVEMENT OF THE SYNTHETIC PROCESSES THROUGH THE USE OF SUPERCRITICAL CO2 (SC-CO2) AS THE REACTION MEDIUM. WHILE THE UNIQUE PROPERTIES OF SUPERCRITICAL FLUIDS (SCF) HAVE BEEN KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME, INTENSIVE RESEARCH IN SCF USAGE IS ONLY OF RECENT VINTAGE. MOST APPLICATIONS OF SCF ARE IN EXTRACTIVE PROCESSES, RATHER THAN CHEMICAL SYNTHESIS,AND NONE HAS YET BEEN TRIED FOR PEPTIDE SYNTHESIS. SC-CO2 IS PARTICULARLY INTERESTING BECAUSE OF ITS LOW CRITICAL TEMPERATURE, 31.12C, SOLVENT WHICH COULD BE GENERATED IN SPACE OR ON MOON FROM LOCALLY AVAILABLE RESOURCES. THUS, A VARIETY OF SCF PROCESSES MAY BECOME OF IMPORTANCE TO NASA. WE WISH TO STUDY THE SYNTHESIS OF PEPTIDES BECAUSE OF THEIR VERY HIGH VALUE PER UNIT WEIGHT, GREAT ECONOMIC AND SOCIO-MEDICAL VALUE AND THE POSSIBILITY OF ACHIEVING SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OF THE PROCESS IN MICROGRAVITY.",

THE RECENT REQUIREMENTS FOR SUBMICRON FEATURE DIMENSIONS HAVE PLACED STRESSING DEMANDS ON EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS REACTIVE ION ETCHING AND INERT ION BEAM ETCHING. REACTIVE ION BEAM ETCHING (RIBE) HAS RECENTLY BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO OFFER ADVANTAGES RELATIVE TO THESE TECHNOLOGIES BY FACILITATING RAPID ETCHING WITH HIGHLY PRECISE, SUBMICRON PATTERN DEFINITION. HOWEVER, AVAILABLE ION BEAM SOURCE DESIGNS INCORPORATE THERMIONIC ELECTRON EMITTERS WHICH ARE EASILY DAMAGED BY THE GASES USED IN RIBE PROCESSING. THIS RESULTS IN SHORT ION SOURCE LIFETIME, THEREBY GREATLY LIMITING THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF RIBE. PULSE SCIENCES, INC. PROPOSES TO OVERCOME THIS PROBLEM BY DEVELOPING AN INEXPENSIVE RADIO FREQUENCY (RF) ON SOURCE WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE INSENSITIVE TO REACTIVE GASES AND THEIR PRODUCTS. AN EXPERIMENTAL, 20-30 CM, MAGNETIC-FIELD-FREE, RF ION SOURCE SYSTEM WILL BE CONSTRUCTED WHICH INCORPORATES A COLD CATHODE DISCHARGE IGNITER. PLASMA GENERATION EXPERIMENTS WILL BE PERFORMED WITH O2 AND CCL4 GASES AT RF FREQUENCIES UP TO 13.56 MHZ. ION EMISSION UNIFORMITY WILL BE MEASURED AND OPTIMIZED AT A CURRENT DENSITY OF APPROXIMATELY 1 MA/CM2 WITH THE GOAL OF ACHIEVING LESS THAN 5% VARIATION OVER THE CORE OF THE BEAM.",

THE INITIAL RESEARCH WILL FOCUS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SERUM-FREE MEDIUM THAT WILL SUPPORT THE GROWTH AND DIFFERENTIATION OF ERYTHROCYTES, GRANULOCYTES, MACROPHAGES, AND LYMPHOCYTES. SPECIFIC ATTENTION WILL BE PAID TO THE PURITY OF EACH COMPONENT AND ONLY HUMAN COMPOUNDS WILL BE USED WHERE BIOLOGICAL COMPONENTS ARE FOUND NECESSARY. SUCH STUDIES WILL EMPLOY THE IN VITRO ASSAYS THAT ARE ROUTINELY USED FOR HEMATOPOIETIC CELLS. THE INITIAL SERUM-FREE MEDIUM WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR THE PROLIFERATION OF NORMAL HUMAN PERIPHERAL BLOOD LYMPHOCYTES AND SUBSEQUENTLY MODIFIED FOR BONE MARROW CELLS. THIS APPROACH SHOULD NOT ONLY LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SERUM-FREE MEDIUM BUT ELUCIDATE THE ROLE EACH COMPONENT PLAYS IN HEMATOPOIESIS. PHASE I WILL PRIMARILY USE ERYTHROCYTES, GRANULOCYTES, AND MACROPHAGES TO GAIN AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMPONENTS THAT WILL SUPPORT PROLIFERATION AND DIFFERENTIATION OF HEMATOPOIETIC CELLS. PHASE II WILL EXTEND THIS EFFORT TO DEVELOP A SERUM-FREE MEDIUM FOR ALL THE HUMAN HEMATOPOIETIC CELLS. SUCH A MEDIUM WILL BE USEFUL FOR STANDARDIZING IN VITRO HEMATOPOIETIC ASSAYS AND TRANSPLANTATION STUDIES WHERE SPECIFIC BONE MARROW POPULATIONS NEED TO BE EXPANDED.",

IN THE LAST THREE YEARS, QUANTIC HAS ACTIVELY EXPLORED AVAILABLE CAPACITORS FOR USE IN EFI APPLICATIONS, AND IS DEVELOPING DESIGNS BASED ON MYLAR, KAPTON AND ALUMINUM, THE GOAL BEING ESSENTIALLY THE SAME PERFORMANCE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN A87-62. A CAPACITOR WRAPPING MACHINE HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AND BUILT THAT ENABLES PRODUCTION OF THESE CAPACITORS. SINCE QUANTITIES BUILT TO DATE ARE SMALL, EXTENSIVE RELIABILITY TESTING HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETED. THEREFORE, THE PROPOSED EFFORT WOULD BUILD AND DELIVER TO HDL TEN CAPACITORS THAT WILL MEET THE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA, AND WILL ALSO PROVIDE MORE EXTENSIVE ANALYSIS AND TEST RESULTS TO INDICATE THE RELIABILITY OF THE CAPACITOR FOR THE INTENDED APPLICATION. A KEY ISSUE IN THIS ANALYSIS IS THE PRODUCIBILITY OF A RELIABLE CAPACITOR AT LOW COST, AND THIS IN TURN IMPLIES EXTREME QUALITY CONTROL ON THE FILMS AND FOIL USED. ONCE SUCH A CAPACITOR IS AVAILABLE AT LOW COST, AND COUPLED WITH THE LOW COST DC-DC CONVERTER PROPOSED IN A SEPARATE SBIR, THE ELEMENTS OF THE COMPACT AND INEXPENSIVE ARTILLERY FUZE BASED ON AN EFI SYSTEM BECOMES FEASIBLE. THESE ALL-ELECTRIC, EFI-BASED FUZES PROMISE TO IMPROVE SAFETY, INCREASE RELIABILITY, AND REDUCE COSTS AS COMPARED TO CURRENT MECHANICAL DEVICES.",

IT IS INDEED AN EXCELLENT MATERIAL FOR PRODUCING TUNABLE LASER RADIATION FROM 400 TO 700NM WHEN IT IS USED AS AN OPO, PUMPED BY A THIRD HARMONIC 354.7NM FROM A ND:YAG LASER. IT IS PROPOSED THAT A PRACTICALOPO DEVICE BE BUILT USING ONE CRYSTAL AS OPO AND ONE AS OPA FOR TUNING THE RANGE 400NM TO 700NM WITH A CRYSTAL ORIENTATION OF 27 DEG AND TUNING OVER + OR - 5 DEG. THE OPO CRYSTAL (6X10X7MM[3]) IS TUNED IN THE 10MM DIRECTION TO GIVE ADEQUATE TUNING OF + OR - 5 DEG ANGLE. THE OPA CRYSTAL SIZE IS 6X10X9MM(3) FOR ADEQUATE AMPLIFICATION. THE CRYSTAL CD*A IS USEDAS TYPE I DOUBLER AND KD*P IS USED AS A TYPE II TRIPLER. THE OVERALL TRIPLING EFFICIENCY OF 25% OF THE FUNDAMENTAL 1060NM ND\"YAG RADIATION. THIS 355NM TRIPLED RADIATION WILL BE USED TO PUMP THE B-BBO OPO AND SUBSEQUENT BBO OPA WITH AN EXPECTED EFFICIENCY OF 20 TO 30% OF THE PUMP AT 355NM. THIS DEVICE IS SOLID STATE, EFFIEICNT, RELIABLE, COMPACT AND HIGHLY TEMPERATURE STABLE BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE FEATURE OF A VERY LARGE TEMPERATURE ACCEPTANCE WIDTH OF 55 DEG C (FWHM). A MARKED IMPROVEMENT IN THE OPO PERFORMANCE IS EXPECTED TO CREATE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN THE SOLID STATE TUNABLE LASER TECHNOLOGY.",

MANY PROCESSES REQUIRE MONITORS TO TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION WHEN AN ABNORMAL CONDITION ARISES, OR JUST TO MAKE ONGOING ADJUSTMENTS TO MAXIMIZE EFFICIENCY. IN COMPLEX SYSTEMS THE MONITORING TASK CAN BE TEDIOUS AND SOMETIMES OVERLY DEMANDING FOR HUMAN OPERATORS. AUTOMATED PROCESS CONTROL SYSTEMS ARE ALSO VALUABLE EVEN FOR VERY SIMPLE PROCESSES, TO MINIMIZE THE DEMANDS FOR HUMAN INTERVENTION. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT WHEN A PROCESS IS MONITORED IN HAZARDOUS OR INACCESSIBLE ENVIRONMENTS. QUINTUS COMPUTER SYSTEMS PROPOSES TO MEET THIS CHALLENGE BY PROVIDING SPECIALIZED PROCESS CONTROL TOOLS THAT WILL RUN EFFECTIVELY IN A MULTIPROCESSING ENVIRONMENT THAT WILL SUPPORT THE LATEST ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGY. HOOKS FOR EFFICIENT TRANSFER OF DATA STRUCTURES FROM FOREIGN SOFTWARE AND SENSORS ARE PROVIDED, AND THE INFERENCE ENGINE PROPOSED IS A PRIORITY-BASED REASONING TOOL THAT CAN QUICKLY RECOGNIZE AND RESPOND TO SIGNIFICANT EVENTS.

THE PORTABLE SYSTEM WILL ENABLE THE IMAGING CHARACTERISTICS OF AN X-RAY SYSTEM TO BE MEASURED RAPIDLY IN SITU IN THE FIELD AT A LEVEL OF SOPHISTICATION FOUND NOW ONLY AT ADVANCED LABORATORY FACILITIES AND REQUIRING SUBSTANTIAL TIME. THE INCREASED KNOWLEDGE OF IMAGE PARAMETERS SHOULD IMPROVE THE LEVEL OF MEDICAL IMAGE QUALITY AND REDUCE PATIENT RADIATION DOSE. THE DEVELOPED SYSTEM WILL PERFORM X-RAY UNIT MEASUREMENTS NOW REQUIRING SEVERAL INSTRUMENTS, AND IT WILL USE RECENT SOLID-STATE ADVANCEMENTS IN MICROCOMPUTER HARDWARE.

THIS MAY RESULT IN HIGH WATER-TO-OIL-PRODUCING RATIOS AND ABANDONMENT OF A PROJECT AT A RELATIVELY LOW VOLUMETRIC SWEEP EFFICIENCY. ONE APPROACH TO IMPROVED SWEEP EFFICIENCY IS TO PLACE A GELLED POLYMER INTO THE HIGH PERMEABILITY ZONES, THEREBY DIVERTING THE INJECTED FLUID INTO TIGHTER PARTS OF THE ROCK.CURRENT TECHNOLOGY RELIES ON THE INJECTION OF GELLED OR GELLING POLYMER SOLUTIONS INTO THE HIGH PERMEABILITY INTERVALS NEAR THE WELLBORE TO PLUG THEM. THE SOLUTIONS GELWITHIN A DAY OR TWO; THUS TREATMENT IS CONFINED TO THE REGION IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF THE WELLBORE. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS TREATMENT IS OFTEN LIMITED BY CROSSFLOW OF THE INJECTED FLUID BETWEEN HIGH AND LOW PERMEABILITY REGIONS. THAT IS, WHEN THE TREATMENT IS CONFINED TO THE REGION NEAR THE WELL THE INJECTED FLUID MAY SIMPLY FLOW AROUND THE TREATED REGION AND INTO THE HIGH PERMEABILITY ZONE. IT IS PLANNED TO INVESTIGATE AN INNOVATIVE PROCESS THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR IN-DEPTH PERMEABILITY MODIFICATION, THUS REDUCING THE EFFECT OF CROSSFLOW. THIS PROCESS IS BASED ON DELAYING THE GELATION OF POLYACRYLAMIDE POLYMER BY GENERATING THE CROSSLINKING AGENT, CHROMIUM (III), IN SITU AND CONTROLLING THE RATE OF THIS REACTION THROUGH CHEMICAL KINETICS. PREVIOUS DOE SPONSORED RESEARCH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS HAS SHOWN THAT GELATION TIMES OF DAYS TO MONTHS CAN BE OBTAINED IN THELABORATORY BY APPROPRIATED SELECTION OF COMPOSITIONS. HOWEVER, THE PROCESS HAS NOT RECEIVED SUFFICIENT FIELD TESTING. WE WILL EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF IN-DEPTH PERMEABILITY MODIFICATION USING A DELAYED GEL SYSTEM BY FIELD TESTING IN AN OIL RESERVOIR IN SOUTHEAST KANSAS.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF LASER SYSTEMS HAS PROVIDED A MEANS OF OBTAINING FLOWFIELD DATA, HOWEVER, THESE SYSTEMS ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO ADJUSTMENT AND ALIGNMENT, AND REQUIRE HIGHLY TRAINED PERSONNEL FOR OPERATION AND DATA ANALYSIS. A LESS SENSITIVE TECHNIQUE FOR OBTAINING QUANTITATIVE FLOWFIELD DATA IS NEEDED. THE WORK PROPOSED HERE WILL USE STERO PHOTOGRAPHY AND SPECIALLY DEVELOPED LIGHTING TECHNIQUES TO MEASURE A PARTICLE TRAJECTORY AND VELOCITY AS IT PASSES NEAR AN UNDERSEA VEHICLE. PHASE I COVERS THE DESIGN OF THE SYSTEM FOR STEREO PHOTOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS FOR THE TRACKING OF A PARTICLE PASSING NEAR AN UNDERSEA VEHICLE. THIS WILL INCLUDE DETERMINATION OF CAMERA REQUIREMENTS, DESIGN OF ILLUMINATION AND CONTROL POINT SYSTEMS, SPECIFICATION AND/OR DESIGN OF SUPPORT EQUIPMENT, AND A DETAILED PLAN FOR A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT TEST.

IN COMMERCIAL WORK A RULE OF THUMB IS TO REPLACE OR REBUILD CUTTERS IF STORAGE EXCEED FOR (4) MONTHS. THEREFORE, NO DATA EXISTS ON THE EFFECTS OF LONG TERM BEARING DEFORMATION, LUBRICANT DEGRADATION, SEAL ELASTOMER DETERIORATION, COMPONENT CORROSION OR OTHER AGING PHENOMENON WHICH COULD CAUSE MISSION FAILURE. THE PHASE I EFFORT PROPOSED WILL IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS ALL THE STORAGE ISSUES IN A TYPICAL CUTTER CONFIGURATION. IN ADDITION, A METHODOLOGY FOR ANALYZING FAILURE MODES WILL BE DEVELOPED. FINALLY, THE FEASIBILITY OF SPECIFIC DESIGN CHANGES DIRECTED AT THE LIMITED PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS OF A CUTTER, AFTER LONG TERM STORAGE, WILL BE INVESTIGATED. PHASE II EFFORTS WOULD INCLUDE THE MANUFACTURE OF SPECIALIZED CUTTERS, ACCELERATED LIFE TESTS, AND PROOF OF PERFORMANCE TESTS. THE ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY DEVELOPED IN PHASE I WILL BE APPLIED TO ASSESS WHETHER A CUTTER CAN BE DEVELOPED TO SERVICE BOTH STORAGE AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS, OR IF PERIODIC MAINTENANCE OR REPLACEMENT IS NECESSARY.",

WHEN PUMPED BY APULSED, FREQUENCY-DOUBLED NEODYMIUM (ND) LASER, THE TI: SAPPHIRE LASER ACHIEVES NEARLY QUANTUM-LIMITED CONVERSION OF PUMP ENERGY INTO OUTPUT ENERGY. THE PULSE LENGTH OF CONVENTIONAL ND LASERS OPERATED IN THE FLASHLAMP-PUMPED, Q-SWITCHED MODE IS, HOWEVER, MUCH SHORTER THAN NECESSARY FOR PUMPING THE TI-SAPPHIRE SYSTEM. THE HIGH PEAK POWER ASSOCIATED WITH THE SHORT LENGTH LIMITS THE PUMP ENERGY DELIVERABLE PER UNIT AREA, BECAUSE OF OPTICAL DAMAGE TO THE SURFACE OF THE SAPPHAIRE CRYSTAL. THE INTENT OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO BEGIN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANENERGETIC (1 JOULE AND GREATER), FREQUENCY-DOUBLED ND LASER WITH A PULSE LENGTH ON THE ORDER OF 1-2 MICROSECONDS. IF A MICROSECOND PUMP SOURCE COULD BE DEVELOPED, THE ENERGY OUTPUT FROM A GIVEN APERATURE SIZE OF THE TI:SAPPHIRE GAIN MEDIUM COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED. THE PROPOSED PHASEI EFFORT WOULD INCLUDE A STUDY OF DIFFERENT TECNIQUES FOR GENERATING MICROSECOND-DURATION PULSES, AN EXPERIMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION OF ONE PARTICULAR TECHNIQUE AND AN ASSESSMENTOF SECOND-HARMONIC GENERATION EFFICIENCIES ATTAINABLE WITH KNOWN NONLINEAR CRYSTALS.",

THE CIRCUIT BASE CONCEPT IS A RELATIONAL DATABASE METHODOLOGY FOR INTEGRATING CAD/CAE SOFTWARE AND FOR MANAGING ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS ENGINEERING DATA. IT IS INNOVATIVE IN THE USE OF A RELATIONAL APPROACH, IN INCLUDING SYSTEMS CONFIGURATION AND ENGINEERING DATA, AND IN INTERFACING WITH RELIABILITY AND OTHER SYSTEMS ENGINEERING SOFTWARE. CIRCUIT BASE INTERFACES CAD/CAE TASKS IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THE DESIGN ENGINEER DOES NOT HAVE TO RE-DESCRIBE THE SCHEMATIC FOR EACH APPLICATION PROGRAM. INSTEAD, THE CIRCUIT BASE SOFTWARE ENTERS RESULTS FROM ONE PROGRAM INTO THE DATABASE AND EXTRACTS CORRECTLY FORMATTED INPUT FILES TO THE NEXT PROGRAM. IMPLEMENTING THESE MODULES IN A RELATIONAL DBMS LANGUAGE GIVES MANAGEMENT CONTROL OVER ENGINEERING PROJECT DATA. THE PHASE I EFFORT WILL ADDRESS THE MOST UNCERTAIN ASPECT OF THE INNOVATION - WHETHER THE DATABASE CONCEPT IS ADEQUATE TO ACCOMMODATE ALL OF THE DATA NEEDS OF THE VARIOUS CAE PROCEDURES. THEREFORE IT WILL CONCENTRATE ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE ENGINEERING DATA REQUIREMENTS AND SPECIFICATION OF THE DATA DICTIONARIES.",

THE INNOVATION OF THIS PROPOSED STUDY IS TO UTILIZE INFORMATION FROM AN ANALYSIS OF THE ERROR TERMS IN FLUID DYNAMIC EQUATIONS TO GENERATE SOLUTION ADAPTIVE MESHES THAT PRODUCE THE MOST ERROR FREE SOLUTION POSSIBLE WITH THE GIVEN NUMBER OF MESH POINTS. SINCE ERROR TERMS DIFFER FOR DIFFERENT FORMS OF THE EQUATIONS, SEVERAL COMMON FLUID DYNAMIC EQUATIONS WOULD BE INVESTIGATED. SOLUTIONS OF A DESIRED ACCURACY COULD BE ACHIEVED WITH FEWER GRID POINTS THAN IS CURRENTLY POSSIBLE.

BY ELIMINATTING ITERATION WITHIN A TIME STEP, AND ALLOWING TIME STEPS TO BE CHOSEN BY ACCURACY CONSIDERATIONS RATHER THAN BY STABILITY LIMITS, THIS INNOVATIVE PROCEDURE WOULD LEAD TO A SUBSTANTIAL SAVINGS IN COMPUTER RUN TIME. IN ADDITION, FOR STEADY STATE PROBLEMS, IMPROVED CONVERGENCE RATES COULD BE EXPECTED. THE PROPOSED METHOD IS QUITE GENERAL AND COULD BE APPLIED TO A WIDE CLASS OF PROBLEMS IN WHICH PATCHED GRIDS ARE REQUIRED.

MEASUREMENT OF VELOCITY CHARACTERISTICS IN COMPLEX AND UNSTEADY FLOWS IS A PROBLEM OF GREAT PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE. HOT-BLOCK ANEMOMETRY IS PROPOSED TO EXTEND CURRENT CAPABILITY AND TO PROVIDE INSTANTANEOUS VALES OF FLOW SPEED AND DIRECTION IN THE COMPLETE RANGE FROM SIMPLE, LAMINA FLOWS TO COMPLEX, TURBULENT FLOWS. HOT BLOCK ANEMOMETRY IS AN EXTENSION OF WELL-ESTABLISHED THERMAL ANEMOMETRY AND HAS RESULTED IN PART FROM RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN MICROCOMPUTER AND SURFACE-COATING TECHNOLOGIES. HOT-BLOCK ANEMOMETRY WILL PROVIDE CONTINUOUS AND SIMULTANEOUS MEASUREMENT OF ALL THREE VELOCITY COMPONENTS IN UNSTEAD FLOWS AND IN A WIDE RANGE OF TURBULENT FLOWS. MEAN AND TURBULENT QUANTITIES OBTAINED WITH HOT-BLOCK ANEMOMETRY SHOULD BE MORE ACCURATE THAN THOSE OBTAINED WITH 5-HOLE IMPACT PROBES OR HOTWIRE ARRAYS AND MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE THAN THOSE OBTAINED WITH LASER VELOCIMETRY. THE PHASE I FEASIBILITY STUDY WOULD PROVIDE A DESIGN, AND AN ASSESSMENT OF MANUFACTURABILITY OF A HOT-BLOCK PROBE. PHASE IIWOULD DEVELOP A PROTOTYPE PROBE, AN ASSOCIATED DATA-ACQUISITON SYSTEM AND SOFTWARE PACKAGE, AND WOULD PROVIDE A COMPLETE PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENT.

UNDER THE SCOPE OF THIS PROPOSAL, A NEW FILTERING AND SMOOTHING SCHEME BASED ON CVA-AIC WILL BE DEVELOPED THAT WILL BE USED TO PROCESS DATA WITH ABRUPT CHANGES. THE PHASE I EFFORT OF A THREE PHASE RESEARCH PROGRAM CONSISTS OF THREE MAJOR TASKS: (I) TO DEVELOP A CVA-AIC BASE FILTERING/SMOOTHING SCHEME FOR HANDLING DATA WITHOUT ANY ABRUPT CHANGE, (II) TO DEVELOP A CVA-AIC BASED TECHNIQUE FOR DETECTING AND ESTIMATING THE TIME OF OCCURRENCE OF ABRUPT CHANGE AND (III) INTEGRATING THESE SCHEMES INTO A COMPLETE DESIGN PACKAGE. CVA-AIC TECHNIQUE WILL ALSO BE USED FOR OPTIMAL ORDER SELECTION OF THE POLYNOMIAL IN THE \"CLASSICAL\" LEAST SQUARE MOVING ARC POLYNOMIAL SMOOTHING TECHNIQUES.

THIS STUDY IS TO SHOW THE FEASIBILITY OF EFFICIENTLY COMMUNICATING USING THE MBC. THE USE OF A FEEDBACK CHANNEL HAVING A SNR COMPARABLE TO THAT OF THE FORWARD CHANNEL IS EMPLOYED. THE RESEARCHERS INTEND TO PROVE THAT THE CHANNEL CAPACITY CAN BE INCREASED BY A FACTOR OF 5 TO 10 OVER PRESENTLY AVAILABLE SYSTEMS THROUGH THE USE OF VARIABLE BIT RATE TRANSMISSION, AND THE ERROR IN AN ACCEPTED MESSAGE CAN BE REDUCED BY SEVERAL ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE BY USING THE RETRANSMISSION PRINCIPLE (A FORM OF \"INFORMATION FEEDBACK\").THE EFFECT OF PACKET SIZE ON THROUGHPUT AND ERROR RATE WILL ALSO BE STUDIED.",

A PROBLEM WITH THE USE OF SUCH INSTALLED RADARS IS THEIR LOWPRF (PULSE REPETITION RATE) AND THE ASSOCIATED ALIASING ASSOCIATED WITH A DIRECT MEASUREMENT OF WIND VELOCITY. AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO THIS PROBLEM IS TO MEASURE THE WIND VELOCITY GRADIENT, WHICH MEASUREMENT CAN UTILIZE A MUCH LOWER PRF (TEN TO ONE), SPECIFICALLY THE PRF EMPLOYED BY SUCH INSTALLED RADARS. IT IS INTENDED TO VERIFY THIS CONCEPT VIA ANALYSIS OF EXISTING WINDSHEAR WEATHER RADAR DATA. THIS VERIFICATION WOULD THEN POTENTIALLY PERMIT INSTALLED WEATHER RADARS, WITH AN AFFORDABLE ATTACHED DOPPLER PROCESSOR TO PROVIDE A WINDSHEAR WARNING.

IN THE PROPOSED SYSTEM, THE EFFLUENT OF THE GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY MIXED WITH A GAS STREAM CONTAINING OXYGEN AND ENTERS A PHOTOCHEMICAL REACTOR. ANALYTES WHICH ABSORB UV RADIATION ARE QUENCHED BY MOLICULAR OXYGEN TO FORM SINGLET OXYGEN WHICH ISSUBSEQUENTLY DETECTED SELECTIVELY BY PHOTOIONIZATION. BE- CAUSE THE ANALYTE ONCE QUENCHED BY OXYGEN CAN ABSORB ANOTHE-ER PHOTON, THE REACTION IS PHOTOCATALYTIC AND SHOULD RESULT IN THE FORMATION OF 5 OF 50 MOLECULES OF SINGLET OXYGEN PER MOLECULE OF ANALYTE. THIS PHOTOAMPLIFICATION SHOULD PERMIT SUB-PICOGRAM TO LOW FEMTO GRAM DETECTION LIMITS FOR ENVIRON-MENTALLY IMPORTANT COMPOUNDS SUCH AS POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HY-DROCARBONS AND THEIR NITRO-DERIVATIVES. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE RESEARCH TO BE CONDUCTED DUR-ING PHASE I AND PHASE II PROJECTS WILL RESULT IN AN IMPROVE-MENT OF THE SENSITIVITY AND EXTEND THE UTILITY OF THE EXIST-ING DETECTORS FOR GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY.

PRESENT INSPECTION METHODOLOGY REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT TIME DELAYS BETWEEN WELDING AND ACCEPTANCE OF THE WELD. THE COST OF THESE DELAYS IS ENORMOUS CONSIDERING THAT PIPELINE COSTS RUN UPWARDS OF $10 6/MILE AT RATES OF APPROXIMATELY 10 MILES/WEEK. ON-LINE MONITORING CAN BE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE A MINIMUM OF 10% ACCELERATION IN PROJECT SCHEDULE WITH ASSOCIATED BENEFITS IN BETTER INSPECTION QUALITY, RECORD KEEPING AND FEEDBACK TO THE WELDING SYSTEM. AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO THIS INSPECTION PROBLEM IS TO FOLLOW THE WELDING PROCESS WITH A LINESCAN X-RAY IMAGING SYSTEM DESIGNED TO OPERATE ON THE HOT WELD. THE X-RAY GENERATOR, X-RAY CONVERTER SCREEN AND LINESCAN CAMERA SYSTEM MUST BE DEVELOPED FOR COMPACT SIZE, SENSITIVITY TO APPLICABLE INSPECTION CODE REQUIREMENTS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL RUGGEDNESS. THE SYSTEM WILL AUTOMATICALLYSCAN THE PIPE WELD FOLLOWING EACH PASS OF THE AUTOMATIC WELDER OR BE USED TO INSPECT THE ROOT PASS AND FINAL PASS OF MANUAL WELDERS. THE LINESCAN DATA WILL BE IN VIDEO FORMAT FOR DISPLAY AND STORAGE. THIS IMAGING FORMAT READILY ALLOWS IMAGE PROCESSING FOR IMPROVED DEFECT ANALYSIS AND FITNESS-FOR-SERVICE ESTIMATIONS.

THIS PROPOSAL PRESENTS A STUDY WHICH WILL IMPLEMENT AN ICE CONSTITUTIVE MODEL SUBROUTINE TO WORK IN CONJUNCTION WITH A LAGRANGE EXPLICIT FINITE-DIFFERENCE NUMERICAL SOLUTION SCHEME, WHICH IS CAPABLE OF HANDLING TRANSIENT, LARGE DISPLACEMENT AND LARGE STRAIN PROBLEMS. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES OF THE PHASE I STUDY ARE: (1) DEVELOP A CONSISTENT SET OF METHODOLOGIES TO PREDICT THEICE BEHAVIOR AND FORCES ASSOCIATED WITH PENETRATION OF A RIGID SPHERICAL OR FLAT INDENTER INTO A FLAT ICE WALL AT HIGH VELOCITIES. THE CONSTITUTIVE MODEL WILL BE AN EXTENSION AND REFINEMENT OF TWO MODELS FOR LOW AND HIGH STRAIN-RATES, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN PRESENTED BY THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR. (2) PRESENT COMPARISON OF PREDICTED INDENTATION BEHAVIOR AT HIGH AND LOW VELOCITIES. (3) DISCUSS GENERALIZATION OF METHODOLOGIES TO OTHER GEOMETRIES, VELOCITY RANGES, AND LARGER CONTACT AREAS, PARTICULARLY FOR CONDITIONS RELEVANT TO FIELD ICE LOADING ONOFFSHORE STRUCTURES.",

CURRENTLY, A NUMBER OF IN VITRO SCREENING TESTS ARE USED TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC DRUGS. MOST OF THESE TESTS UTILIZE NONHUMAN (MOSTLY RODENT) CELL LINES THAT MAY NOT DISTINGUISH SPECIES-SPECIFIC DIFFERENCES IN TOXICITY OF CHEMICALS BETWEEN HUMANS AND RODENTS. ALTHOUGH A FEW HUMAN CELL LINES (HT-29, A549, KB) ARE CURRENTLY USED TO SCREEN CHEMICALS FOR THEIR CYTOTOXICITIES, NONE OF THEM ARE RESPONSIVE TO ESTROGENS OR ANTIESTROGENS. BECAUSE IN RECENTYEARS PATIENTS WITH HORMONE-RESPONSIVE SOLID TUMORS HAVE BEEN TREATED WITH BOTH ENDOCRINE DRUGS (ANTIESTROGENS) AND OTHER CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENTS, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO DEVELOP ANIN VITRO SCREENING TEST WITH APPROPRIATE HUMAN ESTROGEN-SENSITIVE AND ESTROGEN-NONSENSITIVE CELL LINES. USE OF HUMAN CELL LINES WILL ALSO BE MORE RELEVANT IN VIEW OF THE DIFFERENCES IN THE SPECIES-SPECIFIC CYTOTOXICITY OF ANUMBER OF COMPOUNDS. SITEK RESEARCH LABORATORIES PROPOSES TO DEVELOP A RELIABLE PROTOCOL FOR A RAPID, IN VITRO TEST USING ESTROGEN-RESPONSIVE AND ESTROGEN-NONRESPONSIVE HUMAN CELL LINES. SUCH A TEST WILL BE SENSITIVE, RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE, AND ALLOW THE EVALUATION OF A NUMBER OF SAMPLESAT THE SAME TIME. IN ADDITION, THE TEST WILL DISTINGUISH THE TOXICITY CAUSED BY THE ANTIESTROGENS FROM THE NONSPECIFIC CYTOTOXICITY OR TOXICITY CAUSED BY OTHER CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC DRUGS.",

SUCH A CAPABILITY IS IMPORTANT IN MANY APPLICATIONS IN ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH, POLLUTION CONTROL, TOXIC GAS SENSING, AND INDUSTRIAL PROCESS MONITORING. ALTHOUGH SPECIALIZED LASER METHODS HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED FOR MEASURING SELECTED SPECIES, NONE OF THE METHODS DEVELOPED TO DATE HAS THE DESIRED COMBINATION OF HIGH SENSITIVITY AND WIDE GENERALITY. THIS STUDY WILL INVESTIGATE THE OPTOACOUSTIC DETECTION OF GAS SPECIES USING NEW HIGHER POWER TUNABLE DIODE LASERS THAT ARE NOW COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE. THIS APPROACH COMBINES THE HIGH SENSITIVITY OF OPTOACOUSTIC DETECTION WITH THE GENERALITY OFTUNABLE INFRARED DIODE LASER SPECTROSCOPY FOR MEASUREMENT OFMANY DIFFERENT SPECIES. A GOAL OF PHASE I IS TO DEMONSTRATEDETECTION SENSITIVITY EQUIVALENT TO SPECIES CONCENTRATIONS WELL BELOW 1 PPB FOR MOST INFRARED-ACTIVE MOLECULES. THE PHASE I STUDY WILL EMPHASIZE AN ASSESSMENT OF DESIGN FACTORSAND MEASUREMENT APPROACHES TO OPTIMIZE THE SENSITIVITY UNDERCONDITIONS IN WHICH A GAS MIXTURE IS BEING CONTINUOUSLY SAMPLED. THE RESULTS OF PHASE I WILL PROVIDE THE REQUIRED DATA TO PERMIT THE PHASE II DEVELOPMENT OF PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENTATION THAT CAN BE USED FOR ULTRASENSITIVE REAL-TIME CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF GAS MIXTURES IN A WIDE RANGE OF RESEARCH AND INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS.",

THE EFFECT OF VARIABLE FLIGHT CONDITIONS ON THE STABILITY AND RESPONSE OF SUCH FLIGHT VEHICLES IS DISCUSSED.

IN CONTRAST TO THE USUAL PRACTICE OF USING BANDS OF FIXED GAINS IN THE CONTROL SYS TEMS, THE USE OF VARIABLE GAIN SCHEDULING IS ADDRESED IN ORDER TO IMPROVE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE. TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS, A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO THE ANALYSIS AND DESIGN OF NON-AUTONOMOUS CONTROL SYSTEMS FOR THESE VEHICLES WILL BE DEVELOPED. THE APPROACH TO BE USED IS THE GENERALIZED MULTIPLE SCALES (GMS) METHOD ESTABLISHED BY THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR. THIS METHOD IS IDEALLY SUITED TO THESE PROBLEMS AS IT IS PARTICULARLY APPLICABLE TO THE STUDY OF NON-AUTONOMOUS PHENOMENA EXHIBITING RAPID AND SLOW DYNAMICS AS IN THE CASE OF THE HYPERVELOCITY MISSILE. THE GMS APPROACH IS ESPECIALLY APPLICABLE TO THE DESIGN OF SUCH CONTROL SYSTEMS. THE PHASE I EFFORT WILL DEVELOP THE METHODOLOGY AND VALIDATE IT TO A FIRST LEVEL USING AVAILABLE ICBM DATA.

IN THIS AREA, THE DEAF STUDENT REQUIRES CONSIDERABLE PRACTICE AND FEEDBACK AS HE/SHE ATTEMPTS TO LEARN TO SPEAK THE LANGUAGE PROPERLY. SOME AREAS OF LANGUAGE LEARNING CAN BE TAUGHT IN A CLASSROOMENVIRONMENT. THESE INCLUDE VOCABULARY, GRAMMAR AND WRITING.HOWEVER, PROPER SPEAKING OF THE LANGUAGE IS BEST LEARNED IN A ONE-TO-ONE STUDENT-TO-INSTRUCTOR ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE OF THE CONSTANT AND IMMEDIATE EXPERT FEEDBACK REQUIRED. WHAT IS REQUIRED IS A DEVICE THAT ALLOWS THE DEAF STUDENT TOPRACTICE SPEAKING UNSUPERVISED AND YET RECEIVE IMMEDIATE, EXPERT FEEDBACK ON HIS/HER PERFORMANCE. THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL INVESTIGATE THE USE OF A PHONETIC-BASED, LARGE VOCABULARY, CONTINUOUS SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE VISUAL FEEDBACK TO DEAF STUDENTS AS TO THE INTELLIGIBILITY OF THEIR SPEECH.",

THE HYPOTHESIS THAT PROTEIN KINASE C MAY BE THE TARGET OF ANTITUMOR AND OTHER THERAPEUTIC AGENTS WILL BE TESTED BY: (1) REFINING MIXED MICELLAR-ASSAY METHODS TO SCREEN FOR PROTEIN KINASE C AGONISTS AND ANTAGONISTS AND THEIR MECHANISM OF ACTION; (2) APPLYING THESE METHODS TO THEPILOT TESTING OF 500 COMPOUNDS, SUBMITTED TO NCI, THAT POSSESS ANTITUMOR ACTIVITY; AND (3) REFINING METHODS OF SN-1,2-DIACYLGLYCEROL QUANTITATION AND APPLYING THEM TO NORMAL AND DISEASED TISSUES. THESE STUDIES ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO ONCOGENESIS AND ANTITUMOR THERAPEUTIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. IMPORTANTLY, SUCH ANALYSES WILL ESTABLISH THE DESIRABILITY OF BIOCHEMICALPRESCREENS OF COMPOUNDS SUBMITTED TO THE NCI AND ELUCIDATE CAUSATIVE AGENTS OF CELLULAR TRANSFORMATION. THE CENTRAL INVOLVEMENT OF PROTEIN KINASE C AND SN-1,2-DIACYLGLYCEROL SECOND MESSENGERS IS RELEVANT TO ENDOCRINOLOGY, NEUROLOGY, GROWTH, DIFFERENTIATION, DEVELOPMENT, ARTHRITIS AND OTHER INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES, SMOOTH MUSCLE CONTRACTION, PSORIASIS, DIABETES, AND OTHER HUMAN CONDITIONS.",

NITROGEN IS THE MAJOR IMPURITY OF DIAMONDS (UP TO 0.3 AT.%) AND PLAYS A MAJOR ROLE IN INFLUENCING THEIR OPTICAL AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES. ION IMPLANTATION OF DIAMOND HAS BEEN STUDIED BYA NUMBER OF RESEARCHERS FOR ELECTRICALLY DOPING BUT THERE ARE ONLY TWO KNOWN REPORTS IN THE LITERATURE WHICH ADDRESS THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF IMPLANTED DIAMONDS. BRITISH WORKERS (1) FIND THAT B-AND N-IMPLANTED DIAMONDS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR IN BOTH LABORATORY WEAR TESTS AND INDUSTRIAL MACHINING TESTS. A RECENT REPORT FROM CHINA(2) SUGGESTS THAT IMPLANTATION REDUCES MICROCLEAVAGING THOUGHT TO BE AN IMPORTANT WEAR MECHANISM OF DIAMOND. THESE STUDIES, ALTHOUGH PROVOCATIVE, RAISE MORE QUESTIONS THAN THEY ANSWER. THE PRESENT PROPOSAL ADDRESSES MANY OF THE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS OF WHEN AND WHY DOES IMPLANTATION IMPROVE THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF DIAMOND. NITROGEN AND BORON IMPLANTATIONS WILL BE PERFORMED AT BOTH AMBIENT AND ELEVATED TEMPERATURES TO ENCOURAGE NITROGEN AGGREGATION AND ANNEAL OUT RADIATION DAMAGE, WHICH LEADS TO GRAPHITIZATION AT EXCESSIVE DOSES. IMPLANTATION PARAMETERS (ION SPECIES, DOSE, ENERGIES) WILL BE CORRELATED WITH MECHANICAL PROPERTY CHANGES (FRICTION AND WEAR) IN PHASE I.",

THE MEASURED DECREASE IN ACTIVITY IS DIRECTLY CORRELATED WITH LOSS OF SURFACE MATERIAL BY CALIBRATION MEASUREMENTS, ALLOWING AN EXTREMELY PRECISE, OFTEN SUBMICROMETER DETERMINATION OF WEAR.

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

DESIGNERS WHO ARE ENGAGED IN THE DESIGN OF REAL-TIME EMBEDDED COMPUTER SYSTEMS COULD GREATLY BENEFIT FROM THE PERFORMANCE ADVANTAGE OF HARDWARE-BASED RAPID PROTOTYPING. OUR APPROACH INVOLVES AN INNOVATIVE WAY OF COMBINING TWO NEW AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES, SILICON COMPILATION AND PROGRAMMABLE LOGIC DEVICES (PLDS). IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE, PLDS CONTAINING 10,000 EQUIVALENT GATES WILL BE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE. THE AVAILABILITY OF SUCH DEVICES IN CONJUNCTION WITH SILICON COMPILATION TECHNOLOGY LEADS TO NEW POSSIBILITIES IN RAPID PROTOTYPING OF DIGITAL SYSTEMS. THE GOAL OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORT IS TO PRODUCE A SILICON COMPILER WITH A RETARGETABLE BACK END WHICH CAN SUPPORT RAPID PROTOTYPING UTILIZING VERY LARGE PLDS. THE COMPILER WILL ALSO SUPPORT GATE ARRAY AND STANDARD CELL DESIGN SO THAT THE DESIGN CAN QUICKLY AND EASILY BE MOVED INTO COST-EFFECTIVE VOLUME PRODUCTION.",

APPROPRIATE ANCILLARY DEVICES WILL ALSO BE DEVELOPED. THE LAS WILL PROVIDE AUTOMATION OF DIFFICULT AND TIME-CONSTRAINED EXPERIMENTS, WITH THE EVENTUAL ADDITION OF EXPERT SYSTEM SUPERVISION. IN PHASE I, DEVELOPMENT OF THE DEVICES ALREADY BEGUN WILL CONTINUE, AND DEVELOPMENT OF MORE SOPHISTICATED DEVICES WILLBEGIN. IN PHASE II, THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROPOSED DEVICESWILL BE CONCLUDED. THESE DEVICES CAN BE USED IN ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL RESEARCH, I.E., IN STUDIES OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS OF NORMAL AND PATHOLOGICAL PROCESSES. SOME DEVICES, SUCH AS THE PHYSIOLOGICAL MONITOR, CAN BE USED FOR MONITORING SUBJECTS' PHYSIOLOGICAL STATES, E.G., DURING SLEEP STUDIES.",

THE SPECTRAL-SPATIAL FILTERS WERE DESIGNED USING A LEAST-SQUARES LINEAR MAPPING TECHNIQUE TO COMPENSATE FOR THE SMEARING EFFECTS CAUSED BY THE FINITE SPECTRAL BANDWIDTH OF THE LIGHT OUTPUT OF THE CRT. THE EXPERIMENT DEMONSTRATED THAT THESE SPECTRAL-SPATIAL FILTERS PROVIDE BETTER RECOGNITION RELIABILITY THAN SPATIAL FILTERS ALONE. THE OVERALL PURPOSE OF THE PROPOSED PROGRAM IS TO PROVIDE A SIMPLE, ECONOMICAL, INCOHERENT PROCESSOR SYSTEM FOR REAL TIME IMAGE IDENTIFICATION AND CLASSIFICATION. THIS TYPE OF SYSTEM WILL BE APPLICABLE FOR USE IN RECOGNIZING COLOR IMAGES, PSEUDO-COLOR INFRARED IMAGES AND COLOR CODED IMAGES. IT WILL BE DESIGNED IN A COMPACT FORM SUITABLE FOR SUBSEQUENT MANUFACTURE AND WILL UTILIZE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE COMPONENTS. THE MAJOR PHASE I TASKS WILL BE: THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN IMAGE DATA BASE; THE DESIGN OF THE SPECTRAL-SPATIAL FILTER FOR PROCESSING WITH INCOHERENT LIGHT; THE ANALYSIS OF THE INFORMATION PROCESSING CAPABILITIES OF THE FILTER; AND THE DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF THE COMPLETE IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM. DURING PHASE II, THE SPECTRAL-SPATIAL FILTER WILL BE BUILT USING COMPUTER GENERATED ELECTRON-BEAM HOLOGRAMS, THE SYSTEM WILL BE TESTED AND DEMONSTRATED AND ITS PERFORMANCE ANALYZED AND COMPARED TO PREDICTED PERFORMANCE.",

IN PARTICULAR, ACTIVATED CARBON IS USED TO ABSORB VOLATILE ORGANICS FROM THE EXHAUST AIR IN THE PRINTING AND PAINTING INDUSTRIES. A NECESSARY PART OF SUCH OPERATIONS IS THE REGENERATION OF THE ACTIVATED CARBON WITH SIMULTANEOUS RECOVERY OF THE ORGANIC MATERIAL, WHICH IS GENERALLY VERY INEFFICIENT EXCEPT FOR HIGHLY VOLATILE MATERIALS. GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS NOW RESTRICT THE ALLOWABLE CONCENTRATIONS OF VOLATILE ORGANIC SOLVENTS FROM THESE OPERATIONS THAT CAN BE EMITTED TO THE ATMOSPHERE. IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO RECOVER THE ORGANICS FOR REUSE IN THE OPERATION. AN ENTIRELY NEW REGENERATION TECHNIQUE, CALLED SURFACTANT-ENHANCED CARBON REGENERATION (SECR) IS BEING INVESTIGATED FOR RECOVERY OF ORGANICS EMITTED BY THE PRINTING AND PAINTING INDUSTRY. WITH SECR, THE ABSORBER CONTAINING THE USED, SPENT CARBON IS TREATED WITH A CONCENTRATED SURFACANT SOLUTION. THE ORGANIC MATERIAL ON THE SPENT CARBON IS DESORBED AND SOLUBILIZED IN THE SURFACTANT SOLUTION. THEN, THE SURFACTANT IS PRECIPITATED AND RECYCLED TO THE PROCESS. SETTLING YIELDS SEPARATION OF THE ORGANIC AND THE WATER. AFTER FLUSHING WITH WATER, THE CARBON IS RETURNED TO SERVICE WITH DRYING FOR USE IN AIR STREAMS. THE PROCESS HAS POTENTIAL FOR ENERGY EFFICIENT, LOW TOXICITY, ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE, LOW COST RECOVERY OF FUGITIVE ORGANIC VAPORS WITH MINIMAL HANDLING OF SOLID MATERIALS. IN THE PHASE I WORK, ORGANICS USED IN PRINTING/PAINTING WILL BE CARRIED THROUGH ALL THE PROCESS STEPS. PERFORMANCE DATA WILL BE OBTAINED ON EVERY STEP, INCLUDING RATES AND CONCENTRATIONS. THE RESULTS WILL PERMIT PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE COMPETITIVE STRENGTH OF SECR AND JUSTIFICATION FOR IMPLEMENTING PHASE II.",

THE PROVEN MOBILE TARGET ANALYSIS TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED BY PLANNING RESEARCH CORPORATION USING NON-IMAGE BASED DATA WILL BE USED AS AN INITIAL APPROACH TO NARROW DOWN THE POTENTIAL TARGET SITES. THE NEXT ACTION IS TO EMPLOY LOW RESOLUTION MULTISPECTRAL IMAGERY TO REJECT THE BACKGROUND AREAS THAT HAVE A LOW PROBABILITY OF TARGET LOCATION. FOR FEATURE EXTRACTION AND CAMOUFLAGE DETECTION PROCESSED, HIGH RESOLUTION IMAGE DATA LIKE SAR, ELECTRO-OPTICAL, THERMAL IR AND EVEN VIDEO IMAGERY WILL BE EXPLOITED. PRECISION TARGETING FOR A BALLISTIC MISSILE DELIVERY SYSTEM WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY A SCENE MATCHING METHODOLOGY USING THE STABLE STRUCTURE AREA AROUND THE TARGET LOCATION. WITH MULTI-TEMPORAL IMAGE DATA, MOBILE MISSILES CAN BE DETECTED BY MEANS OF A STRUCTURAL CHANGE DETECTION METHODOLOGY; THIS NOVEL APPROACH IS TO PERFORM THE CANCELLATION OF THE STATIONARY OBJECTS BY MEANS OF SUBTRACTING THE SCENE'S STRUCTURAL UNITS INSTEAD OF THE PIXELS. THE BASIS FOR THE PROPOSED IMAGE EXPLOITATION TECHNOLOGIES IS THE STABLE STRUCTURE THEORY AND ITS ASSOCIATED ALGORITHMS DEVELOPED BY DR. HSU OF SR&E.; SINCE THE MAJORITY OF THE PROPOSED ALGORITHMS HAVE BEEN EVALUATED AND DETERMINED AS VERY EFFECTIVE FOR EXTRACTING GROUND TARGETS FROM THE BACKGROUND CLUTTER, WE FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THE PROPOSED METHODOLOGIES WILL WORK FOR THE MOBILEMISSILE TARGETS AS WELL.",

AT THE POWER LEVELS REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE THIS \"ULTRASONIC HEMATOCRIT,\" CAVITATION WAS NOT OBSERVED. THIS NEW TECHNIQUE PORTENDS TO DEVELOPMENT OF A DEVICE THAT WILL, IN A MATTER OF SECONDS, PROVIDE HEMATOCRIT VALUES FROM BLOOD COLLECTED IN MICROHEMATOCRIT TUBES. THIS CAPABILITY WILL ALLOW EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE PERSONNEL AND OTHERS TO QUICKLY OBTAIN USEFUL CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM INFORMATION. BECAUSE ONLY SMALL VOLUMES OF BLOOD ARE REQUIRED, THIS TECHNIQUE WILL LIKELY FIND USE IN THE TREATMENT OF NEONATES. PHASE I WILL DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF THE APPROACH AND PROVIDE THE FRAMEWORK AND DATA NECESSARY TO JUSTIFY CONTINUED WORK.

THIS SYSTEM MUST BE ABLE TO LOCATE AND MONITOR BOTH THE AIRBORNE OBJECTS AND THE GROUND VEHICLES. IT IS DESIRED THAT THE AIRBORNE OBJECTS REQUIRE NO MODIFICATIONS TO BE TRACKED. THE SYSTEM SHOULD OPERATE IN DUST, RAIN, SNOW AND FOG. OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE IS THE ACCURATE MEASURE-MENT OF THE RELATIVE SEPARATION OF THE SUBMUNITIONS AFTER EJECTION FROM THE CARRIER. IT IS PROPOSED THAT AN ADVANCED INTERFEROMETRIC MEASUREMENT (AIM) METHODOLOGY BE USED TO DEVELOP A SYSTEM TO TRACK THE SMALL OBJECTS BY THEIR BACKSCATTER FROM A POWERFUL ILLUMINATOR. THE GROUND VEHICLES WILL BE EQUIPPED WITH BEACONS TO ALLOW TRACKING THEM WITH THE SAME SYSTEM. THE MAJOR DEFICIENCY IN CURRENT SYSTEMS USED FOR THIS IS THEIR INABILITY TO COPE WITH MANY DIFFERENT OBJECTS SIMULTANEOUSLY. THE SYSTEM PROPOSED USES POST FLIGHT PROCESSING WITH THE ABILITY TO ACCURATELY DESCRIBE THE LOCATION AND VELOCITIES OF MULTIPLE OBJECTS. GROUND TARGETS AND A SINGLE LARGE (CROSS SECTION) AIRBORNE TARGET CAN BE TRACKED IN REAL-TIME.",

THESE ALGORITHMS ARE BASED UPON COMPUTING THE INVERSE-SCATTERING SOLUTION TO THE EXACT (NOT LINEARIZED) INHOMOGENEOUS HELMHOLTZ WAVE EQUATION. THIS SOLUTION PROVIDES SEPARATE AND INDEPENDENT IMAGES OF DENSITY (RHO), COMPRESSIBILITY (KAPPA), AND ABSORPTION (ALPHA).

THE FAILURE MODE HAS NOT BEEN EXPERIMENTALLY SIMULATED FOR DEEP BASE CONDITIONS. THE COMBINED APPLICATION OF NORMAL AND SHEAR STRESSES AT DYNAMIC RATES, WITHOUT PORE PRESSURE DRAINAGE, IS LIKELY TO PRODUCE HIGH PORE PRESSURES FOR ANY OVERPRESSURE IN WHICH THE JOINT NORMAL CLOSURE EXCEEDS SHEAR-INDUCED NORMAL DILATION. THIS SYNERGISTIC EFFECT OF SIMULTANEOUS SHEAR AND NORMAL LOADING WITHOUT DRAINAGE IS IMPORTANT IN ROCK TYPES CONSIDERED FOR SITING DEEP BASED STRUCTURES, SPECIFICALLY IN WEAK, POROUS ROCKS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO INVESTIGATE PORE PRESSURE RELATED STRENGTH DEGRADATION AT AN APPROPRIATE OVERPRESSURE LEVEL AND DYNAMIC RISE TIME OF INTEREST FOR DEEP BASING TO PROVE FEASIBILITY FOR DETAILED DEFINITION OF THE PHENOMENON IN PHASE II.

ONE AREA OF CURRENT DEVELOPMENT IS ADVANCED METHODS FOR THE EFFECTIVE DISSIPATION OF EXCESS THERMAL ENERGY. THE MOST EFFECTIVE METHOD FOR THE DISSIPATION OF THERMAL ENERGY IN SPACE IS RADIATION HEAT TRANSFER. FOR LOW TEMPERATURE APPLICATIONS IN THE RANGE OF 250-400K, ONLY LOW HEAT FLUXES CAN BE EMITTED. AT 300K, A THERMAL FLUX OF 0.50W/CM2 BLACKBODY CAN BE EMITTED. THEREFORE, TO RADIATE LARGE QUANTITIES OF POWER AT LOW TEMPERATURES, THE RADIATINGSURFACE AREA MUST BE MAXIMIZED. ONE RELATIVELY LARGE SURFACE AVAILABLE FOR THERMAL RADIATION ON THE SPACE STATIONIS THE OUTER BODY OF THE ACTIVITIES MODULES. BY ENCASING THE MODULE WITH RADIATING PANELS, THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL DEPLOYABLE RADIATORS CAN BE GREATLY REDUCED. THE PROPOSED PROGRAM WILL IDENTIFY ADVANCED DESIGNS FOR A BODY MOUNTED RADIATOR.

LASER SURGERY ALLOWS PRECISE ABLATION OF LESIONS SUCH AS TUMORS, ATHEROSCLEROTIC PLAQUES, AND VASCULAR MALFORMATIONS AT SITES THAT ARE INACESSIBLE BY OTHER TECHNIQUES. HOWEVER, IT IS ALSO RELATIVELY EASY TO DAMAGE NORMAL TISSUES ADJACENT TO OR UNDERLYING THE LESIONS, OR TO CAUSE PERFORATIONS IN HOLLOW STRUCTURES. THESE COMPLICATIONS MIGHT BE AVOIDED WITH IN SITU DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE CHARACTER AND THICKNESS OF THE TARGET TISSUES AND THE EXTENT OF THERMAL DENATURATION CAUSED BY THE LASER ENERGY. ULTRASONIC IMAGING, EVEN WHEN SIMPLE AND ONE-DIMENSIONAL, IS MORE LIKELY TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION THAN ARE OPTICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL TECHNIQUES. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THIS PHASE I PROPOSAL ARE TO CONSTRUCT AND EVALUATE A MINIATURE ULTRASONIC TRANSDUCER WITH A RESOLUTION OF <100 AND AN IMAGING DEPTH >1 CM THATCOULD BE COMBINED WITH A SIDE-EMITTING OPTICAL FIBER TO DETERMINE LESION THICKNESS AND TO CONTROL ABLATION.

BASED ON CLINICAL RESULTS OBTAINED FROM APPROXIMATELY 200 CANCER PATIENTS AT THE HARVARD-MIT HYPERTHERMIA CENTER WITH THE PROTOTYPE SIMFU RESEARCH SYSTEM, THERE IS CONSIDERABLE DEMAND FOR A CLINICAL SIMFU SYSTEM WITH COMPARABLE PERFORMANCE. USING THE WELL-DOCUMENTED SIMFU SYSTEM AS THE BASIC MODEL, THE MAJOR GOAL OF THIS PHASE I PROJECT IS TO INVESTIGATE THEFEASIBILITY OF DESIGNING A COMMERCIALLY VIABLE, SCANNED, FOCUSED ULTRASOUND HYPERTHERMIA SYSTEM THAT IS COST EFFECTIVE, CAN BE ROUTINELY ADMINISTERED IN THE CLINICAL SETTING, IS CAPABLE OF TREATING A WIDE VARIETY OF TUMORS, AND IS RELIABLE AND UPGRADABLE. THE EXISTING SIMFU HYPERTHERMIA SYSTEM CURRENTLY IS USE AT THE HYPERTHERMIA CENTER HAS EVOLVED DEVELOPMENTALLY OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS INA RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT. CONSEQUENTLY, IT IS COMPLEX, COSTLY, AND DIFFICULT TO OPERATE. PHASE I FUNDING IS REQUIRED TO DEVELOP THE SPECIFICATIONS NECESSARY FOR STANDARDIZED CLINICAL USE.",

THE PROPOSED DEVICE PROVIDES MEANS FOR CONTROLLED APPLICATION OF HEAT AND PRESSURE TO ATHEROSCLEROTIC TISSUE. THE PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION INVOLVES THE TRANSMISSION OF LASER ENERGY FROM SOURCE TO PATIENT AND THE RAPID CONVERSION OF THIS ENERGY INTO CONTROLLED THERMAL ENERGY AT THE DISTAL END OF THE PROBE. WHEN BROUGHT INTO CONTACT WITH OCCLUSIVE TISSUE, THIS PROBE ALLOWS HEAT TO BE CONDUCTED RAPIDLY TO THIS TISSUE WHILE MAINTAINING A KNOWN PRESSURE ON THE PROBE-TISSUE INTERFACE. THIS RESULTS IN SELECTIVE AND CONTROLLED ABLATION OF OCCLUSIVE TISSUE WITH MINIMAL THERMAL EFFECT ON SURROUNDING TISSUE. THE BASIC DESIGN OBJECTIVE IS TO CREATE AN EXPANDABLE LASERPROBE THAT CAN BE INTRODUCED PERCUTANEOUSLY AND THAT ALONE CAN GENERATE A SUFFICIENTLY LARGE LUMEN TO PERMIT ADEQUATE FLOW THROUGH CORONARY AND PERIPHERAL ARTERIES.

HOWEVER, FOR DRUGS THAT EXHIBIT FIRST-PASS METABOLISM, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EXTENT OF ABSORPTION AND BIOAVAILABILITY IS NONLINEAR, THEREBY LEADING TO REDUCED BIOAVAILABILITY WHEN DRUGS ARE ADMINISTERED AT A VERY LOW RATE INTO THE GI TRACT. THE SPECIFIC AIM OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A DRUG DELIVERY STRATEGY TO REDUCE THE ORAL DOSING INTERVAL OF DRUGS EXHIBITING FIRSTPASS METABOLISM WHILE MAINTAINING BIOAVAILABILITY EQUIVALENT TO THE IMMEDIATE RELEASE DOSAGE FORM. THE STRATEGY ENTAILS THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF A DOSAGE FORM STRATEGY THAT WILL RELEASE FRACTIONS OF THE TOTAL DOSE AT SPECIFIED TIMES/SITES IN THE GI TRACT. IN THIS MANNER, THE BIOAVAILABILITY WILL NOT BE COMPROMISED BY THE DECREASING RELEASE RATE, AS IS OFTEN SEEN IN CONVENTIONAL SUSTAINED-RELEASE DOSAGE FORMS. PROPRANOLOL HAS BEEN CHOSEN AS THE SPECIFIC DRUG TO BE STUDIED. PROPRANOLOL WAS CHOSEN BECAUSE ITS PHARMACOKINETICS ARE REASONABLY WELL UNDERSTOOD AND IT EXHIBITS DOSE-DEPENDENT BIOAVAILABILITY IN THE NORMAL THERAPEUTIC DOSAGE RANGE. FURTHERMORE, THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS IN THE LITERATURE OF TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED FOR THE CONTROLLED RELEASE OF PROPRANOLOL (FOR EXAMPLE, INDERAL-LA) THAT ARE NOT SATISFACTORY WITH RESPECT TO THEIR BIOAVAILABILITY.",

A SELECT GROUP OF ORGANOSILICON POLYMERS THAT CAN BE CONVERTED INTO SIC, SI3N4, SI2ON2, AND SIO2, WILL BE SYNTHESIZED. THIN POLYMER FILM ON SILICON SUBSTRATE WILL BE PREPARED BY SPIN-ON METHODS. THIS PROCESS HAS SEVERAL ADVANTAGES OVER OTHER CONVENTIONAL DEPOSITION METHODS. THE VISCOSITY OF POLYMER SOLUTION CAN BE ADJUSTED EASILY BY SOLVENTS SO AS TO BE IDEAL FOR THIN FILM PREPARATION. THESE POLYMERIC MATERIALS CAN BE INITIALLY PROCESSED LIKE AN ORGANIC POLYMER AND SUBSEQUENTLY CONVERTED TO INORGANIC FILMS. THE RESULTANT FILM COMPOSITIONS CAN BE MODIFIED EASILY BY USING VARIOUS ORGANOMETALLIC POLYMERS. THE THIN POLYMER FILM WILL BE SUBJECTED TO ION BEAM IRRADIATION. HIGH ENERGY ION BEAM IRRADIATION OF THE POLYMER FILM CAN DISSOCIATE THE POLYMER INTO SMALLER FRAGMENTS, AND ORGANIC VOLATILE FRAGMENTS WILL DIFFUSE THROUGH THE FILM AND ESCAPE. ANY ELEMENT THAT IS NOT REMOVED IN THE FORM OF VOLATILE SPECIES IS SUBSEQUENTLY ENRICHED WITH RESPECT TO THE OTHER ELEMENTS. THE CONVERSION (REMOVAL OF VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPONENT) CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED AT RELATIVELY LOW PROCESSING TEMPERATURES. INORGANIC FILMS PREPARED BY THIS METHOD ARE EXPECTED TO BE DENSER AND MORE ADHERENT TO THE SUBSTRATE THAN THOSE PRODUCED BY CONVENTIONAL THIN FILM TECHNIQUES.",

MAGNESIUM ALLOYS ALSO HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED FOR AEROSPACE APPLICATIONS BECAUSE OF THEIR LIGHT WEIGHT. HOWEVER, THEIR POOR CORROSION RESISTANCE AND MECHANICALBEHAVIOR HAVE RESTRICTED THEIR USE. FURTHER WEIGHT REDUCTION OF TI ALLOYS AND IMPROVEMENT IN CORROSION AND MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF MG ALLOYS REQUIRE RESEARCH OF NEW ALLOYS BASED ON THESE MATERIALS. IT IS PROPOSED TO MEET THESE OBJECTIVES BY DEVELOPING TI-LI, TI-MG, MG-CR AND MG-AL ALLOYS. CONVENTIONAL ALLOYING TECHNIQUES CANNOT BE APPLIED TO FABRICATE MOST OF THE PROPOSED ALLOYS OVER A COMPOSITION RANGE. THEREFORE, A NOVEL TECHNIQUE BASED ON VAPOR DEPOSITION AND SUBSEQUENT ION IRRADIATION HAS BEEN PROPOSED. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THIS TECHNIQUE WILL ENABLE THE FABRICATION OF THE PROPOSED ALLOYS WITH AN AMORPHOUS OR FINE GRAIN MICROSTRUCTURE. TRANSMISSION ELECTRONMICROSCOPY WILL BE USED TO ANALYZE THE MICROSTRUCTURAL DETAILS. POTENTIODYNAMIC POLARIZATION MEASUREMENTS WILL BE CARRIED OUT ON FABRICATED MG ALLOY FILMS FOR EVALUATION OF THEIR CORROSION BEHAVIOR.",

VERAX CORPORATION HAS DEVELOPED A NOVEL SYSTEM FOR THE MASS CULTURE OF MURINE HYBRIDOMA CELLS, AS WELL AS SEVERAL SERUM-FREE MEDIA. IT IS PROPOSED TO EXTEND DEVELOPMENT WORK TO STUDIES OF HUMAN HYBRIDOMA CELL CULTURE. OF PARTICULAR INTEREST IS AN ANALYSIS OF THE FEASIBILITY OF ADAPTING SEVERAL HUMAN HYBRIDOMA CELL LINES TO THE CELL-IMMOBILIZING MATRIX MATERIAL. IN ADDITION, IT IS PLANNED TO DEVELOP MINIMAL CULTURE MEDIUM FOR THE GROWTH AND ENHANCED PRODUCTIVITY OF THESE CELLS WHEN THEY ARE IMMOBILIZED IN THE COLLAGEN MATRIX. PRELIMINARY STUDIES WITH HUMAN HYBRIDOMA CELL LINES IN BATCH CULTURE EXPERIMENTS SUGGEST THAT SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES EXIST BETWEEN HUMAN/HUMAN AND MOUSE/MOUSE HYBRIDOMAS IN TERMS OF THEIR GROWTH AND IMMUNOGLOBULIN PRODUCTION POTENTIAL. THE CONDITIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR EFFICIENT PRODUCTION OF HUMAN MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES WILLBE DEFINED.

THESE PROBLEMS OCCUR BECAUSE NEARLY SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE PROPELLANT CHEMICAL ENERGY, REMAINS IN THE GAS IN THE FORM OF THERMAL AND KINETIC ENERGY. THE AFOREMENTIONED PROBLEMS ARE A DIRECT RESULT OF THIS ABUNDANCE OF HOT, HIGH-PRESSURE GAS THAT IS RAPIDLY VENTED FROM THE BARREL. THE KEY TO ALLEVIATING THIS PROBLEM IS TO DIVERT GAS FROM THE BARREL SO THAT THE GAS CONDITIONS AT THE BARREL EXIST HAVE BEEN EXPANDED TO LOWER PRESSURE, REDUCED TEMPERATURE AND LESS OVERALL KINETIC ENERGY. THE DIVERTED GAS IS THEN DISPERSED SEPARATELY SO THAT THE VOLUME AND, THEREFORE, THE ENERGY DENSITY OF THE EXHAUST GAS IS DECREASED TO LEVELS THAT ELIMINATE SEVERE BLAST AND FLASH. VERITAY PROPOSESD TO DEVELOP THE METHODOLOGY FOR PREDICTING FLOW CONDITIONS, PROBLEM ASSESSMENT, AND DESIGN DEVELOPMENT. FOUR DESIGN CONCEPTS WILL BE FORMULATED AND EVALUATED, THREE THAT DIVERT GAS AT THE MUZZLE AND THE OTHER THAT DIVERTS GAS AT THE BREECH.

IN THIS PROPOSAL, A SERIES OF NEW CHELATING AGENTS WILL BE PREPARED FROM CHITOSAN. CHITOSAN IS A MODIFICATION OF THE BIOPOLYMER CHITIN, A POLYSACCHARIDEFOUND IN THE EXOSKELETON OF CRUSTACEANS. IN THIS PROPOSED PROGRAM, CHITOSAN WILL BE DEPOLYMERIZED, DERIVATIZED, AND FRACTIONATED INTO VARIOUS MOLECULAR WEIGHT RANGES USING MEMBRANES. THESE DIFFERENT MOLECULAR WEIGHT FRACTIONS WILL BE EVALUATED FOR ENHANCED CHELATION PROPERTIES AND SOLUBILITY OF THE COMPLEXES. THE DEGREE OF SUBSTITUTION OF CHITOSAN DERIVATIVES WILL BE OPTIMIZED TO ACHIEVE MAXIMUM CHELATION. THE AVAILABILITY OF DIFFERENT MOLECULAR WEIGHT DERIVATIVES WILL ALLOW ONE TO CHOOSE THE DESIRED SOLUBILITY OF THE CHELATION COMPLEX. THE SOLUBLE CHELATED METAL COMPLEXES WILL BE CONCENTRATED BYULTRAFILTRATION MEMBRANES. AFTER USING THIS ULTRAFILTRATIONMEMBRANE TECHNIQUE, THE AQUEOUS FILTRATE WILL CONTAIN VERY LOW CONCENTRATIONS OF METAL IONS, AND CAN THEN BE DISCHARGEDOR RECYCLED. THE RETENTATE WILL CONTAIN CONCENTRATED METAL IONS WITHIN THE CHITOSAN CHELATE. THE METAL IONS CAN THEN BE RECOVERED FROM THE CHITOSAN. THIS PROCEDURE CAN BE APPLIED TO WATER EFFLUENT AT INDUSTRIAL SITES. THE CHITOSAN DERIVATIVES IN THE MOLECULAR WEIGHT RANGE THAT PRODUCE INSOLUBLE CHELATION COMPLEXES CAN BE USED IN PRECIOUS METAL RECOVERY AS A MEANS OF CONCENTRATING THE METAL. THE METAL CAN THEN BE RECOVERED FROM THE COMPLEX. THE ENHANCED CHELATING ABILITY OF THESE NEW POLYMERS WILL ALLOW THEM TO COMPLETE ECONOMICALLY WITH SYNTHETIC CHELATINGAGENTS, THEREBY EXPANDING THE UTILIZATION OF WASTES PROCESSED FROM SHELLFISH.",

A MODULAR APPROACH IS TO BE USED WHERE TWO EXISTING FINITE DIFFERENCE CODES, ONE FOR THE ROTOR, THE OTHER FOR THE FUSELAGE ARE MATED. THE INDIVIDUAL MODULES HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED BY THE INVESTIGATORS. THE ROTOR MODULE INVOLVES A BLADE-FIXED COORDINATE SYSTEM.

THE FUSELAGE MODULE, INCLUDING A GRID GENERATION CODE, HAS BEEN USED TO SOLVE FOR THE FLOW OVER COMPLEX AIRCRAFT CONFIGURATIONS. THE MATING PROCEDURE INVOLVES A UNIQUE \"SLIDING INTERFACE\" THAT ALLOWS THE GRID USED IN EACH MODULE TO SLIDE PAST THE OTHER GRID ALONG A COMMON INTERFACE AS THE ROTOR ROTATES WITH RESPECT TO THE FUSELAGE, AND YET ENABLES FLOW VARIABLES TO BE TRANSFERRED ACROSS THE INTERFACE WITHOUT REQUIRING INTERPOLATION. THE MODULAR APPROACHED PROPOSED WILL ALLOW THE EXISTING CODES PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED TO BE USED WITH STRAIGHTFORWARD MODIFICATIONS, WITH REQUIRING THE DEVELOPMENT WORK TO BE REPEATED.

THESE CRITERIA, FREQUENTLY BASED ON FRACTURE MECHANICS ASSESSMENTS, TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE GEOMETRY, THE IMPOSED LOADING DURING SERVICE, POTENTIAL FAILURE MODES AND THE SERVICE ENVIRONMENT. THE PROPOSED PROGRAM ADDRESSES INCOMPLETE JOINT PENETRATION, ONE FORM OF WELD DISCONTINUITY WHICH IS FREQUENTLY ENCOUNTERED DURING FABRICATION. THE RESULTS WILL BE COMPARED WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF COMPLETE PENETRATION JOINTS AND WILL BE USED AS A BASIS FOR SETTING ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA FOR THIS TYPE OF DISCONTINUITY. THE PROPOSED MATERIAL IS 5083-H131 ALUMINUM. THE RESULTS OBTAINED SHOULD BE APPLICABLE TO OTHER MATERIALS. HOWEVER, ALTERNATIVE MATERIALS CAN BE SUBSTITUTED IF THESE ARE CONSIDERED MORE APPROPRIATE.",

THE SPECIFIC AIMS ARE TO IMPROVE OPTICAL-MEASURING TECHNOLOGY IN THREE AREAS. FIRST, TO IMPROVE THE DYES THAT TRANSDUCE THE CHANGES IN MEMBRANE POTENTIAL INTO OPTICAL SIGNALS, IT IS PROPOSED TO SYNTHESIZE NEW DYES OF NOVEL STRUCTURAL TYPES. SECOND, TO MAKE THE PHOTODIODE ARRAY AND THE ASSOCIATED AMPLIFIERS MORE FLEXIBLE, RELIABLE, AND ECONOMICAL, IT IS PROPOSED TO START WITH AN ARRAY WITH MORE ELEMENTS TO IMPROVE THE SPATIAL RESOLUTION. AND THIRD, TO MAKE THE COMPUTER RECORDING AND ANALYSIS MORE POWERFUL AND ECONOMICAL, HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE FOR A 32-BIT COMPUTER WILL BE DEVELOPED. OPTICAL MONITORING OF MEMBRANE POTENTIAL IS A NEW METHOD THAT ALLOWS SIMULTANEOUS MONITORING FROM MANY SITES. THE PROPOSED DYES, THE MODIFICATIONS TO THE AMPLIFIER SYSTEM, AND THE INCORPORATION OF A 32-BIT COMPUTER INTO THE LABORATORY WOULD BE TECHNICALLY INNOVATIVE.

THE PROPOSED EXPERT SYSTEM HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ASSIST RADIOLOGISTS IN THE INTERPRETATION OF DIAGNOSTIC IMAGES AND CLINICAL DATA USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. THE SYSTEM WAS FORMED BY ENCODING IN THE COMPUTER SOFTWARE THE KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN EXPERTS. THE SYSTEM WILL ASSIST IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF DIFFICULT CASES AND PROVIDE READY ACCESS TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF EXPERTS, LEADING TO INCREASED DISTRIBUTION AND APPLICATION OF MAMMOGRAPHIC EXPERTISE. SPECIFIC AIMS OF PHASE I ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE TO TEST THE CAPABILITY OF AN EXPERT SYSTEM TO MAKE DIAGNOSES BASED UPON CLINICAL AND IMAGE DESCRIPTORS PROVIDED BY RADIOLOGISTS. A PROTOTYPE SYSTEM WILL BE IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED USING VERIFIED CLINICAL CASESTO AID IN THE DISCOVERY OF REASONING METHODS AND DATA DESCRIPTORS THAT CONSTITUTE SUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE TO MAKE DIAGNOSES AT EXPERT LEVELS OF PERFORMANCE. HAVING DEFINED A SUFFICIENT SET OF IMAGE DESCRIPTORS, A PHASE II EFFORT WILL CONCENTRATE ON FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INTERACTIVE IMAGE-UNDERSTANDING PORTION OF THE SYSTEM, INTEGRATION OF THE DIAGNOSTIC AND IMAGE ANALYSIS SUBSYSTEMS,EXPANSION OF THE KNOWLEDGE BASE, AND DEFINITIVE CLINICAL TESTING. A SPECIFIC CHROMOSOMAL ABNORMALITY, THE PHILADELPHIA TRANSLOCATION, IS CHARACTERISTIC OF LEUKEMIC CELLS IN OVER 95 PERCENT OF ALL PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA. THE PHILADELPHIA CHROMOSOME, GENERATED BY THIS TRANSLOCATION, IS THE RESULT OF A BREAK OCCURRING WITHIN THEBCR GENE ON CHROMOSOME 22; SEQUENCES 3' OF THE BREAKPOINT ARE TRANSLOCATED TO CHROMOSOME 9, FROM WHICH THE C-ABL ONCOGENE IS TRANSFERRED INTO THE BCR GENE. THE RESULTING CHIMERIC BCR-C-ABL GENE PRODUCES A CHIMERIC MRNA AND ABNORMAL ABL PROTEIN. FOUR BCR HOMOLOGOUS LOCI HAVE BEEN MOLECULARLY CLONED AND CHARACTERIZED IN PHASE I RESEARCH. IN ADDITION, THREE DIFFERENT ABL HOMOLOGOUS SEQUENCES HAVE BEEN ISOLATED. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DETERMINE THE POSSIBLE INVOLVEMENT OF BCR AND ABL HOMOLOGOUS SEQUENCES IN HUMAN CANCER. IN PHASE II, THE CHROMOSOMAL LOCATION OF THE BCR-RELATED GENES WILL BE DETERMINED AND CDNAS WILL BE ISOLATED FROM THOSE LOCI FOUND TO BE ACTIVELY TRANSCRIBED GENES. PROBES ISOLATED FROM THE CDNAS WILL BE USED TO SCREEN DNAS FROM LEUKEMIAS, LYMPHOMAS, AND SOLID TUMORS FOR REARRANGEMENTS AND TRANSLOCATIONS; PULSED-FIELD, GRADIENT GEL ELECTROPHORESIS MAY BE USED AS AN ALTERNATIVE SEPARATIONMETHOD FOR LARGE DNA FRAGMENTS.

THE SYSTEM WILL BE ABLE TO TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE DIGITAL IMAGES OVER TELEPHONE LINES AND WILL INCLUDE A 1,280 BY 1,024 BLACK AND WHITE CRT DISPLAY WITH 250 ASSIGNABLE GRAY LEVELS. IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO BUILD SUCH A SYSTEM AND SELL IT PROFITABLY FOR $20,000 TO $25,000. AT THIS PRICE LEVEL, SYSTEMS CAN BE ECONOMICALLY INSTALLED AT REMOTE RADIOLOGY OFFICES SO THAT IMAGES CAN BE ANALYZED USING DISPLAYS THAT ARE OF COMPARABLE QUALITY AND SIMILAR FUNCTION TO THOSE OF THE IMAGING SYSTEM. THIS SHOULD IMPROVE THE RESPONSIVENESS AND ACCURACY OF REMOTE IMAGE ANALYSIS VERSUS THE USE OF MESSENGER-CARRIED FILM. REDUCTION IN THE NEED FOR RADIOLOGIST TRAVEL TO PERFORM ANALYSIS MAY ALSO REDUCE COSTS. THE REQUESTED PHASE I GRANT IS TO BE USED FOR THE BUILDING AND TESTING OF ONE PROTOTYPE SYSTEM.",

CONVENTIONALLY, THE RECEIVING ANTENNA(S) ARE STEERED ELECTRONICALLY AS A FUNCTION OF INTRAPULSE TIME TO THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH TARGET ECHOS COULD BE RECEIVED; THIS PROCESS IS CALLED PULSE CHASING. THE ALTERNATIVE DISCUSSED IN THIS PROPOSAL RESULTS IN LESS COMPLEXITY AT THE RECEIVER(S) WITHOUT ADDING SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THE TRANSMITTER. THE CONCEPT INVOLVES A FREQUENCYSENSITIVE ANTENNA EXCITED BY A WIDE BANDWIDTH PULSE TO CAUSE THE TRANSMITTER ANTENNA BEAM TO SWEEP OUT THE ENTIRE SEARCH VOLUME WITHIN A SINGLE PULSE (THE SWAP CONCEPT). THIS ALLOWS A COMPLEX OF FIXED RECEIVER ANTENNA BEAM(S) TO COVER THE DESIRED AZIMUTH EXTENT. THE RF FREQUENCY OF EACH RECEIVER IS SWEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DESIRED RANGE COVERAGE. THE ISSUES TO BE STUDIED UNDER THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDE CANDIDATE GEOMETRIES, ANTENNA TYPES, WAVEFORM DESIGN, SNR AND SCR, TARGET AND CLUTTER PROCESSING, RECEIVER TUNING ALGORITHMS, COHERENCY, POTENTIAL RANGE PERFORMANCE, MEASUREMENT ACCURACIES, AND OTHER TOP-LEVEL SYSTEMS CONSIDERATIONS.",

IN MOST SITUATIONS, WASTE CONTAINMENT IS BY BURIAL OR INJECTION INTO THE SUBSURFACE. COMMONLY OVER TIME, GROUNDWATERS CAN PERCOLATE THROUGH THE WASTE, MOBILIZING THE CONTAMINANTS INTO LOCAL OR MUNICIPAL GROUNDWATER SUPPLIES. THE DEMAND FOR AQUIFER PROTECTION WITH TECHNIQUES TO DELINEATE AND MONITOR THE SPREAD OF CONTAMINANTS HAS NEVER BEEN HIGHER. MANY CONTROVERSIES AND LIMITATIONS EXIST WITH CURRENT GROUNDWATER MONITORING AND SAMPLING METHODS FOR POLLUTION CONTROL. GEOPHYSICAL SYSTEMS WHICH HAVE DEMONSTRATED REMARKABLE SUCCESS IN CONTAMINATION INVESTIGATIONS ALSO HAVE LIMITATIONS OF RESOLUTION, COST-EFFECTIVENESS, AND EASE OF OPERATION WHICH INHIBIT WIDE-SPREAD USE. THUS, THERE IS A LACK OF ADEQUATE TECHNIQUES TO SOLVE POLLUTION CONTROL PROBLEMS. ONE AVENUE WHICH HAS NOT BEEN ADEQUATELY EXPLORED FOR A SOLUTION TO THE POLLUTION DETECTION PROBLEM IS THE APPLICATION OF HIGH-FREQUENCY ELECTROMAGNETIC (EM) GEOPHYSICAL METHODS. TWO POSSIBLE HIGH-FREQUENCY EM TECHNIQUES HAVE A LARGE POTENTIAL FOR SUCCESS WITH GROUNDWATER POLLUTION INVESTIGATIONS. SIMILAR TECHNIQUES, ALTHOUGH LOWER IN FREQUENCY HAVE BEEN USED WITH SOME SUCCESS. BASIC RESEARCH OF THE DESIGN CHARACTERISTICS, CAPABILITIES, AND VIABILITY OF EACH OF THE TWO POSSIBLE STRATEGIES MAY PROVIDE THE FOUNDATION FOR A METHOD SUPERIOR TO EXISTING TECHNIQUES.",

PRESENT SCREENING OF DONATED BLOOD DOES NOT DETECT ALL POTENTIALLY INFECTIOUS CONTAMINANTS. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO FINDA MEANS OF RENDERING BLOOD PRODUCTS NONSPECIFICALLY NONINFECTIOUS TO REDUCE THE RISK OF VIRAL INFECTION AND BACTERIAL SEPSIS ASSOCIATED WITH THERAPEUTIC USE OF PLATELETCONCENTRATES. DIAMOND SCIENTIFIC COMPANY PROPOSES TO DEMONSTRATE THE ABILITY TO INACTIVATE AN ANIMAL-VIRUS MODEL IN PLATELET CONCENTRATES. THE EFFECTS OF THE INACTIVATION TREATMENT ON THE FOLLOWING WILL BE EXAMINED: (1) GROSS PLATELET MORPHOLOGY, BY MEASURING PLATELET COUNT AS A FUNCTION OF INACTIVATION TIME; (2) RESPONSE OF PLATELETS TO AGGREGATING AGENTS; AND (3) PLATELET ACTIVATION BY FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY ASSAY. THIS RESEARCH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE COMMERCIALLY USEFUL IN SAFEGUARDING THE ESTIMATED 5 TO 7 MILLION UNITS OF PLATELETS TRANSFUSED ANNUALLY.",

A NOVEL CONCEPT CONCEIVED BY THE PROPOSER THAT UTILIZES SOLID-STATE PIEZOELECTRIC SENSOR TECHNOLOGY INDICATES THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO SENSE BOTH SURFACE DRAG SHEAR FORCE AND ACOUSTICNOISE GENERATED BY THE AIRFLOW. THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THIS SYSTEM UTILIZE POLYVINYLIDENE FLOURIDE TRANSDUCER FILM MATERIAL (PVDF) FOR SENSING AND A MICROCOMPUTER FOR DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING. DUE TO ITS EXCELLENT PIEZOELECTRIC PROPERTIES AND BROADBAND RESPONSE, THE PVDF CAN SENSE THE BOUNDARY LAYER SURFACE VIBRATORY MOTION RESPONDING TO FREQUENCIES FROM A FEW HZ TO 100 KHZ AND HIGHER. BY INCORPORATING A MICROCOMPUTER INTO THIS SYSTEM, A NUMBER OF DESIGN ADVANTAGES IMMEDIATELY BECOME AVAILABLE.

N87-22, THE DOD SBIR PROGRAM, 1987). THE AEM METHOD HAS RECENTLY EMERGED AS A VIABLE TECHNIQUE FOR AIRBORNE CHARTING OF WATER DEPTH (IN EXCESS OF PERHAPS 100 M), WATER CONDUCTIVITY (THUS, SALINITY AND TEMPERATURE VARIATIONS), AND BOTTOM SEDIMENT CONDUCTIVITY (THUS, DENSITY, POROSITY, AND SEDIMENT TYPES). DURING TWO RECENT EXPERIMENTAL AEM FLIGHTS FOR BATHYMETRIC MISSIONS, THE METHOD HAS PROVED TO BE ABLE TO PROFILE MINUTE CHANGES IN WATER CONDUCTIVITY. THE ABILITY OF THE AEM METHOD TO PROFILE WATER CONDUCTIVITY LEADS US TO BELIEVE THAT THE METHOD CAN BE ADAPTED TO A SUBMARINE DETECTION MISSION. SPECIFICALLY, IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO LOCATE THE DISTURBANCE PLUME WHICH TAILS BEHIND SUBMARINES. THIS CONDUCTIVITY DISTURBANCE PLUME, WHICH MAY BE OF CONSIDERABLE LENGTH, CAN BE AN EASILY TRACKABLE TARGET FOR AN AEM SURVEY.
