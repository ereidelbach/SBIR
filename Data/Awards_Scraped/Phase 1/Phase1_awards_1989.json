THE NEED IS TO ASSIST DESIGN ENGINEERS TO ACCESS LARGE AMOUNTS OF JOINT DESIGN AND DATA THAT IS AVAILABLE. THE EXPERT SYSTEM WILL PROVIDE ALPHANUMERIC AND GRAPHICS INFORMATION TO THE DESIGNER TO ASSIST IN THE OPTIMUM SELECTION OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS JOINING TECHNIQUES. THE RESEARCH WILL INCLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ARCHITECTURE OF AN EXPERT SYSTEM, A KNOWLEDGE TREE OF COMPOSITES AND OF JOINING TECHNIQUES, AND THE HIERARCHY OF POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS. THE DATABASES OF COMPOSITE JOINING MATERIALS, JOINT DETAILS, AND PROCEDURES THAT EXIST SHOULD BE ACCESSED. A METHOD BY WHICH NEW INFORMATION CAN BE COLLECTED AND ORGANIZED MAY BE REQUIRED. THE NEXT TASK WILL BE TO EXAMINE AVAILABLE EXPERT SYSTEM SHELLS FOR THEIR APPLICABILITY TO THE PROJECT. A SIMPLE MODEL SYSTEM WILL BE DEVELOPED USING AN AVAILABLE DEVELOPMENT AND RUN-TIME SHELL, XI PLUS OR EXSYS, TO FURTHER EXPLORE THE INTERACTION OF THE RULES AND DATABASE. THE INPUT/OUTPUT DEVICES WILL BE EXAMINED TO DETERMINE IF VOICE, A MOUSE, OR TOUCH WILL ASSIST THE DESIGNER. A PHASE II EFFORT WOULD RESULT IN A RUN-TIME SYSTEM THAT WAS MODULAR IN CONCEPT AND EXPANDABLE TO INCORPORATE NEW DATABASES AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE.",

THE SCD CAN ELIMINATE ALL SIGNALS THAT DO NOT HAVE A PARTICULAR SIGNAL PARAMETER. DETECTING THE SIGNAL IS SIMPLY A MATTER OF EXAMINING THE PROCESSED SIGNAL SPECTRUM AFTER NOISE AND INTERFERENCE HAVE BEEN SUPPRESSED BY THE SCD.

THE MOST HEAVILY STUDIED PHOTOCONDUCTORS FOR SWITCHING APPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN SEMI-INSULATING SI, GAAS, AND INP. THE MAIN LIMITATIONS OF THESE MATERIALS ARE THEIR LOW LEVELS OF MAXIMUM DC BIAS AND THERMAL RUNAWAY EFFECTS AT HIGH PULSE REPETITION RATES, DUE TO THEIR RELATIVELY LOW THERMAL CONDUCTIVITES AND SMALL BANDGAPS. IN ORDER TO CIRCUMVENT THESE PROBLEMS, IT IS NECESSARY TO CONSIDER SEMICONDUCTING MATERIALS WITH WIDER BANDGAPS AND LARGER DIELECTRIC STRENGTHS THAT CAN SUPPORT HIGHER VOLTAGES. ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING CANDIDATE PHOTOCONDUCING MATERIALS IS DIAMOND BECAUSE OF ITS OVERWHELMINGLY SUPERIOR PHYSICAL PROPERTIES. DIAMOND HAS DARK RESISTIVITIES IN EXCESS OF 10(13) OHMS-CM, ROOM TEMPERATURE THERMAL CONDUCTIVITIES UP TO FIVE TIMES THAT OF COPPER, GREATER CARRIER SATURATION DRIFT VELOCITIES AND A SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER DIELECTRIC BREAKDOWN STRENGTH THAN EITHER SI, GAAS OR INP, PERMITTING RAPID DISSIPATION OF HEAT SO THAT DARK CURRENT AND THERMAL RUNAWAY EFFECTS ARE NEGLIGIBLE.

ADVANCES IN STATE OF THE ART MATERIALS, PARTICULARLYFIBER REINFORCEMENTS, ARE REQUIRED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THESE APPLICATIONS. COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE CVD SIC FIBERS SUFFER FROM POOR CREEP RESISTANCE, A RESULT OF FREE SILICON FOUND AT THE GRAIN BOUNDARIES. THIS PROBLEM, A DIRECT RESULT OF THE PROCESS USED TO MAKE THE FIBER, LIMITS THEIR USE TO LOWER TEMPERATURES (<1000 DEGREES CENTIGRADE). A UNIQUE CVD SOURCE REAGENT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED FOR THE ELECTRONICS COMMUNITY WHICH ENABLES THE REPRODUCIBLE GROWTH OF STOICHIOMETRIC SINGLE CRYSTAL SILICON CARBIDE FOR HIGH POWER ELECTRONIC DEVICES. THIS REAGENT SHOULD ENABLE THE FABRICATION OF A SILICON FREE SILICON CARBIDE FIBER, WHICH SHOULD BE CREEP RESISTANT TO 1550 DEGREES CENTIGRADE. THE PHASE I PROGRAM WILL DETERMINE THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES AND THE HIGH TEMPERATURE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF CVD MONOFILAMENTS MADE USING THIS INNOVATIVE \"MOLECULAR SOURCE\" REAGENT. A PHASE II PROGRAM WILL MORE FULLY DEVELOP THE PROPERTIES OF THE FIBER AND DEVELOP A MANUFACTURING PROCESS FOR ITS PRODUCTION.",

NEW MATERIALS ARE NEEDED TO ADVANCE THESE VITALTECHNOLOGIES. THE MANY ADVANTAGES OF REFRACTORY METAL THIN FILMS PREPARED BY CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION (CVD) INCLUDING CONFORMAL STEP COVERAGE, HIGH ELECTRO-MIGRATION RESISTANCE AND LOW RESISTIVITY MAKE THEM ATTRACTIVE FOR GATE, INTERCONNECT, CONTACT, DIFFUSION BARRIER AND VIA PLUG METALIZATIONS. HOWEVER, THE APPLICATION OF CVD TUNGSTEN ANDMOLYBDENUM TO VLSI PROCESSING HAS BEEN IMPEDED BY THE SECONDARY REACTIONS CAUSED BY THE FLUORINE LIGANDS OF THE ELEMENTAL SOURCE REAGENTS USED IN THE CVD PROCESS. THESE REACTIONS ULTIMATELY LEAD TO THE FAILURE OF THE DEVICE. THEOBJECTIVES OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH ARE THE ELABORATION OF ASET OF MOLECULAR DESIGN CRITERIA FOR REFRACTORY METAL SOURCEREAGENTS AND THE IDENTIFICATION OF A NOVEL ORGANOTUNGSTEN CVD SOURCE REAGENT WHICH REVOLUTIONIZES VLSI METALIZATION. THESE GOALS WILL BE MET BY APPLYING A MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH IN WHICH RESULTS FROM FILM GROWTH AND FUNDAMENTAL DECOMPOSITION STUDIES ARE USED TO REFINE THE MOLECULAR STRUCTURE OF THE SOURCE REAGENTS.",

WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP PERCEPTUAL ORGANIZATION AS A RECURSIVE ENERGY MINIMIZATION PROCESS USING A HOPFIELD NEURAL NETWORK APPROACH. OUR APPROACH IS BASED UPON THE INITIAL EXTRACTION OF SYMBOLIC TOKENS FROM AN IMAGE OR TIME-SEQUENCE OF IMAGES. THESE ARE THEN REDUCED TO PRIMITIVE TOKENS WHICH CORRESPOND TO THE NODES OF THE NETWORK. THE LINKS BETWEEN PRIMITIVE TOKEN NODES ARE THE VARIABLES OF THE HOPFIELD ENERGY FUNCTIONAL. A LOCAL OR GLOBAL ENERGY MINIMIZATION PROCEDURE IS THEN USED TO FORM STABLE PERCEPTUAL GROUPS OVER THIS NETWORK BY EXTRACTING LINKED CLUSTERS OF TOKENS. HIERARCHICAL PROCESSING IS POSSIBLE BY CREATING LINKS BETWEEN THESE STABLE CLUSTERS AND THEN APPLYING THE MINIMIZATION GROUPING PROCESS TO PRODUCE LARGER COHERENT STRUCTURES. THIS RECURSIVE COMBINATION OF PERCEPTUAL GROUPS CORRESPONDS TO A HIERARCHY OF PROCESSING PERFORMED BY THE NETWORK.

STATIC HEAT TRANSFER AND REDUNDANT, STATIC POWER CONVERSION PROVIDED HIGHLY RELIABLE PERFORMANCE. THE EXCELLENT OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE STAR-C IS ACCOMPANIED BY THE USE OF RELATIVELY HIGH TEMPERATURES IN THE REACTOR CORE. AS PART OF THE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO DEMONSTRATE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THERE WILL BE NO SIGNIFICANT MASS TRANSPORT OF MATERIALS FROM THE REACTOR CORE. THE DESIGN OF THE REACTOR CORE AND THE SELECTION OF MATERIALS HAS BEEN SPECIFICALLY BASED ON MINIMIZING THE TRANSPORT OF CORE MATERIALS.THE PURPOSE OF THIS SBIR PROPOSAL IS TO EVALUATE THE EXTENT OF POSSIBLE MASS TRANSPORT AND THE IDENTIFICATION OF VERIFICATION EXPERIMENTS.

A HYBRID FINITE ELEMENT METHOD IS THEN USED TO SOLVE THE PRIMITIVE EQUATIONS OF MOTION FOR PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS. A 3-D MESH GENERATOR IS INCLUDED WITH THE COMPUTER CODE FOR GRID REFINEMENT AND ADJUSTMENT. VANDENBURG AFB IS LOCATED ON THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA COAST. THE TERRAIN CONSISTS OF FLATLANDS, VALLEYS, CANYONS, RIDGELINES, AND MOUNTAINS WHICH RISE TO ELEVATIONS OVER 600 M. WINDFLOW IS INFLUENCED BY SYNOPTIC, REGIONAL, AND LOCAL METEOROLOGICAL EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TERRAIN. STRONG INVERSIONS ARE COMMON OVER THE AERA. THE NUMERICAL MODEL IS CAPABLE OF ACCURATELY CALCULATING FLOW OVER COMPLEX TERRAIN FEATURES, AND CAN BE USED TO PREDICT DISPERSION OF CONCENTRATIONS WITHIN THE MIXING LAYER. A SMALL SCALE VERSION OF THE PROGRAM (UP TO 5000 NODES - 25,000 DEGREES OF FREEDOM) CAN BE RUN ON AN ENHANCED PERSONAL COMPUTER.",

IN ADDITION, SPECIFYING SYSTEM COMPONENT HARDENING REQUIREMENTS CANNOT REALLY BE SEPARATED FROM THE TESTING PROGRAM. THERE ARE ALWAYS CONSTRAINTS LIMITING FUNDS, AND THE SYSTEM WEIGHT AND VOLUME WHICH CAN BE DEVOTED TO NUCLEAR HARDENING. THE LUXURY OF LARGE HARDENING MARGINS DOES NOT EXIST. UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, SYSTEM TESTING AND SYSTEM HARDENING ARE INEXTRICABLY BOUND. GIVEN THE DIFFICULTY IN SIMULATING THE THREAT ENVIRONMENT AND THE HARDENING MARGIN LIMITATIONS, AN IMPORTANT ISSUE IS HOW TO DEFINE AND EVALUATE THE UGT TESTS WHICH WILL ADEQUATELY VERIFY SYSTEM HARDNESS.

        "abstract": "Abstract         THERE IS A CURRENT NEED TO REMOTELY AND NONDESTRUCTIVELY IDENTIFY NUCLEAR SOURCES WITHIN STRUCTURES (OBJECTS) THAT ARE OPAQUE TO ALL BUT NUCLEAR RADIATION. SITUATIONAL EXAMPLES ARE THE IDENTIFICATION OF NUCLEAR SPACE MINES IN THE VICINITY OF BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE SATELLITES AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS TREATY VERIFICATION. IF THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF NUCLEAR MATERIAL WITHIN THE STRUCTURE CAN BE IMAGED THEN, TOGETHER WITH GAMMA-RAY SPECTRAL INFORMATION, THE FUNCTION OF THE NUCLEAR MATERIAL CAN BE DERIVED. NUCLEAR WEAPONS HAVE VERY DEFINITE NUCLEAR MATERIAL CONFIGURATIONS. SPATIAL RESOLUTION IS A PIVOTAL IMAGING SENSOR ISSUE. NUCLEAR MATERIAL FUNCTION IDENTIFICATION REQUIRES A RESOLUTION OF ROUGHLY 2 CM WHICH IS BEYOND THE CAPABILITY OF CURRENT SENSORS, FOR ANY PRACTICAL OBJECT-SENSOR DISTANCE. THE SENSOR PROPOSED HEREIN SOLVES THE HIGH RESOLUTION PROBLEM. THIS IS A PROPOSAL FOR A NOVEL, HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION, GAMMA-RAY SENSOR FOR IDENTIFICATION OF NUCLEAR MATERIAL CONFIGURATIONS. THE SENSOR IS CALLED THE HIGH RESOLUTION GAMMA-RAY CAMERA (HRCAM). THE FOCUS OF THE PROPOSAL IS ON THE HIGH RESOLUTION POSITION SENSITIVE GAMMA-RAY DETECTOR INTERNAL TO THE HRCAM. OPTIC FABRICATION TECHNOLOGY IS BEING INVESTIGATED TO ACCOMPLISH THE MISSION OF HIT CONFIRMATION FOR THE INTERACTIVE DISCRIMINATION PROGRAM. THIS DETECTOR CHAIN WOULD DETECT, WITH ENHANCED BACKGROUND SUPPRESSION, A SIGNAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SURFACE OF OBJECTS INTERROGATED WITH A NEUTRAL PARTICAL BEAM. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS INCLUDE RAPID AND RELIABLE CONFIRMATION THAT THE PROBE BEAM INTERCEPTED A REENTRY VEHICLE OR DECOY. FEASIBILITY IS BEING DETERMINED BY THE CALCULATIONAL DESIGN OF THE DETECTOR CHAIN AND DEMONSTRATION OF A FAVORABLE SIGNAL TO NOISE RATIO, FABRICATION OF A PROTOTYPE SENSOR, AND EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION OF THE SENSOR CONCEPT. A KEY TECHNICAL RISK ISSUE BEING RESOLVED IN THIS STUDY IS THE QUALITY OF THIN SCINTILLATOR FILMS GROWN BY CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION. AT A LATER STUDY, A BRASS BOARD DETECTOR WILL BE FABRICATED AND FIELD TESTED AT NEUTRAL PARTICLE BEAM TEST BEDS TO DETERMINE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE DEVELOPED SYSTEM. A SUCCESSFUL PROJECT WOULD PROVIDE A COST EFFECTIVE MEANS OF OBTAINING HIT CONFIRMATION AND SIMPLIFY THE TECHNICAL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH MID-COURSE INTERACTIVE DISCRIMINATION. THE TECHNOLOGY FOR THE FABRICATION OF UNIFORM THIN SCINTILLATORS COULD BE EXPLOITED FOR MANY IMAGE INTENSIFIER APPLICATIONS.",

RECENTLY, SEVERAL SYNTHETIC ABSORBABLE POLYMERIC SUTURE MATERIALS WERE DEVELOPED THAT DEMONSTRATED SATISFACTION FOR MOST OF THE WOUND CLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. HOWEVER, WHEN USED IN THE MORE DEMANDING ORTHOPEDIC, CARDIOVASCULAR, NEUROLOGICAL, UROLOGICAL, AND ABDOMINAL APPLICATIONS, THESE SYNTHETIC MATERIALS LOSE THEIR STRENGTH PREMATURELY BEFORE COMPLETE SURGICAL HEALING IS ACHIEVED. THEREFORE, A BETTER SOLUTION IS NECESSARY TO PROLONG THE USEFUL LIFETIME OF THESE BIOABSORBABLE SUTURE MATERIALS SO THAT MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF SURGICAL DEVICES CAN BE MADE FROM THESE SYNTHETIC BIODEGRADABLE POLYMERS FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF SURGERY. ADVANCED SURFACE TECHNOLOGY, INC., PLANS A SURFACE MODIFICATION PROCESS OF COMMERCIAL SYNTHETIC ABSORBABLE SUTURE MATERIALS TO ENHANCE THEIR USEFULNESS IN DEMANDING SITUATIONS.

THIS TECHNIQUE, WHICH USES A SINGLE LASER TO BOTH PERTURB MOLECULAR LEVEL POPULATIONS AND DETECT THIS PERTURBATION, HAS SEVERAL FEATURES THAT MAKE IT ATTRACTIVE FOR THE QUANTITATIVE DETECTION OF TRANSIENT SPECIES IN COMBUSTION AND OTHER REACTIVE SYSTEMS. AMONG ITS MOST ATTRACTIVE FEATURES IS ITS ABILITY TO MEASURE AN ABSOLUTE SPECIES CONCENTRATION, WITHOUT A PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF THE MOLECULAR ABSORPTION COEFFICIENT, UNDER THE CONDITION THAT AN INDEPENDENT MEASUREMENT OF DIRECT TRANSMISSION PROVIDES A SECOND EQUATION BY WHICH THE UNKNOWN ABSORPTION CROSS-SECTION MAY BE ELIMINATED, IN THE ONE APPLICATION TO A COMBUSTION SYSTEM SO FAR ATTEMPTED, THE TECHNIQUE'S SENSITIVITY HAS BEEN EQUAL TO SUCH METHODS AS LASER INDUCED FLUORESCENCE, WITHOUT ITS DIFFICULTIES IN QUANTIFICATION.

OUR PULSE SOURCE WILL REQUIRE 20 SQUARE INCHES, USES LOW MAINTENANCE DIODE LASERS, AND DRAWS A FEW WATTS OF POWER. THIS VERY SPECIAL INSTRUMENTATION IS NEEDED TO TEST THE NEW HIGHSPEED INTEGRATED CIRCUITS, GAAS MICROWAVE DEVICES AND PICOSECOND TRANSISTORS, FOR PICOSECONDSYNCHRONIZATION OF ELECTRON BEAM DEVICES AND HIGH ENERGY LASERS, FOR GENERATING PRECISE WAVEFORM HIGH POWER MICROWAVE BURSTS, AND FOR DRIVING ANALOG TO DIGITAL CONVERTERS WITH 30 GHZ SAMPLING RATES. PICOSECOND RESOLUTION IS NEEDED TO EXTRACT THE MAXIMUM SPEED AND EFFICIENCY AND THEREFORE ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE FROM ULTRAFAST ELECTRONICS. THE PULSE OPTICAL SOURCE USES MULTIPLE SEMICONDUCTOR LASERS. OUR UNIQUE APPROACH SOLVES THE BANDWIDTH AND GROUP VELOCITY MISMATCH PROBLEMS RATHER THAN FIGHTING WITH THEM AS IS DONE IN PRESENT MODELOCKED LASERS.

EXISTING LASER RAMAN-BASED INSTRUMENTATION USES A LARGE, HEAVY, AND EXTREMELY INEFFICIENT (0.1 PERCENT) ARGON ION LASER WITH AN INTRACAVITY GAS CELL. THE LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDYIS TO IMPLEMENT A SOLID-STATE ALTERNATIVE TO THE EXISTING ION LASER. SUCH A LASER IS SMALLER, LIGHTER, MUCH MORE EFFICIENT, AND HAS LIFETIMES GREATLY EXCEEDING THAT OF THE PRESENT LASER. THE PROJECT GOALS ARE TO: (1) GUILD A PROTOTYPE UTILIZING THE SOLID-STATE LASER, WHICH PUMPS A PASSIVE EXTERNAL CAVITYCONTAINING A MULTICHANNEL GAS CELL, SELECTED SPECIFIC DIELECTRIC INTERFERENCE FILTERS FOR REJECTION OF THE ELASTICSCATTERED LASER LIGHT AND TRANSMISSION OF GAS-SPECIFIC RAMANLINES, AND SOLID-STATE PHOTODETECTORS; (2) EVALUATE THE PROTOTYPE FOR ACCURACY, LINEARITY, SENSITIVITY, PRECISION, STABILITY, AND INTERFERENCE BETWEEN VARIOUS ANESTHETIC AND RESPIRATORY GASES; AND (3) VALIDATE THE PROTOTYPE FEASIBILITY BY COMPARING THE SIGNAL LEVELS FOR PURE GASES TO THOSE CALCULATED ON THE BASIS OF A SYSTEM MODELING EQUATION.",

THE ABILITY OF RAMAN LIGHT SCATTERING SPECTROSCOPY TO ANALYZE A WIDE SPECTRUM OF GAS MOLECULES AFFORDS A TREMENDOUS CONSOLIDATION OF INSTRUMENTATION. THE RAMAN SPECTRA AND NORMALIZED CROSS SECTIONS OF GASES OF INTEREST WILL BE DETERMINED. A BENCH RAMAN PROTOTYPE WILL BE BUILT TO SIMULTANEOUSLY MONITOR THE GASSES OF INTEREST WITH A CATHODE RAY TUBE DISPLAY, AND DIGITAL AND ANALOG OUTPUTS TO FACILITATE CONTROL AND RECORDING OF EMISSIONS.

IN ADDITION, THIS PRODUCT HAS A DEFINED COMPOSITION, STRUCTURE, AND MECHANISM OF ACTION, UNLIKE MANY OTHER ADJUVANTS. THE ABILITY TO GENETICALLY ENGINEER NOVEL GLUCAN STRUCTURES AND THEN ASSAY THEIR MACROPHAGE-ACTIVATING PROPERTIES WILL ALLOW FOR THE DESIGN AND SYNTHESIS OF THE OPTIMALLY EFFICACIOUS PREPARATION. IN VIEW OF THE BROAD IMMUNOSTIMULATING PROPERTIES OF ADJUVAX(TM), ITS DEVELOPMENT AS AN ADJUVANT FOR USE WITH AN ARRAY OF HIV ANTIGENS IS PROPOSED.

THE US NAVY IS IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING C3 ARCHITECTURES TO SUPPORT THE NAVY'S MISSION AND FUNDAMENTAL WARFARE TASKS. THIS PROCESS INVOLVES ASSESSING ALTERNATIVE C3 ARCHITECTURES TO DETERMINE THEIR IMPACT ON THE MISSIONS THEY SUPPORT. ANALYZING THE PERFORMANCE OF C3 SYSTEMS IS, HOWEVER, NOTORIOUSLY DIFFICULT DUE TO THE COMPLEX NATURE OF C3 AND THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH RELATING VARIATIONS IN THE C3 SYSTEM TO THE PERFORMANCE OF THE MISSION IT SUPPORTS. STAPNS HAVE SHOWN PROMISE IN ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES. ALPHATECH PROPOSES TO CONDUCT THE FEASIBILITY STUDY BY WAY OF EXAMPLES, USING AN ANTISUBMARINE WARFARE (ASW) SCENARIO AS A CASE STUDY. WE WILL CONDUCT THE FIVE TASKS. 1) IDENTIFY AND DESCRIBE THE ASW SYSTEM AND SCENARIO TO BE MODELED. 2) CONSTRUCT A STAPN MODEL OF THE ASW SCENARIO. 3) IMPLEMENT AND EXERCISE THE STAPN MODEL FOR A BASELINE C3 ARCHITECTURE AND ONE ALTERNATIVE C3 ARCHITECTURE USING MODELER, ALPHATECH'S GRAPHICAL C3 SIMULATION TOOL; WE WILL COLLECT AND PERFORM STATISTICAL ANALYSIS ON MEASURES ASSOCAITED WITH THE ASW TOP LEVEL WARFARE REQUIREMENTS. 4) ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF STAPNS AND MODELER FOR NAVAL C3 ARCHITECTURAL STUDIES. AND, 5) PREPARE A FINAL REPORT DETAILING THE RESULTS OF THE PHASE I RESEARCH.",

AMERICAN COMPOSITE TECHNOLOGY (ACT) HAS BEEN ACTIVELY INVESTIGATING METHODS FOR INCREASING THE CONSISTENCY OF PULTRUDED COMPOSITES. THEY FEEL THAT MAJOR QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS COULD BE MADE IF IT WERE POSSIBLE TO CONTINUOUSLY MONITOR THE DEGREE OF CURE OF THE COMPOSITE MATRIX MATERIAL INSIDE THE FORMING DIE AS IT IS BEING CURED. ACT PROPOSES TO DEVELOP A SENSOR COMPATIBLE WITH THEHOSTILE ENVIRONMENT OF HIGH TEMPERATURE, PRESSURE AND ABRASION INSIDE THE PULTRUSION DIE THAT WILL ALLOW THE STATE OF THE MATRIX MATERIAL TO BE CONTINUOUSLY MONITORED. THIS CAPABILITY DOES NOT CURRENTLY EXIST. DATA FROM THE SENSOR COULD BE USED BY A SMART CONTROL SYSTEM TO MAINTAIN PRODUCT QUALITY. THE APPROACH WILL BE TO COMBINE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE SENSOR ELECTRONICS DEVELOPED BY MICROMET INSTRUMENTS FOR MONITORING COMPOSITE CURE IN LESS HOSTILE ENVIRONMENTS WITH A CASTABLE CERAMIC SUBSTRATE.

        "abstract": "Abstract         AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT REQUIREMENT IN ECM JAMMER SYSTEMS IS COHERENT RECEPTION OF THREAT SIGNALS, PRECISE MANIPULATION OF THE WAVEFORM AND RETRANSMISSION BACK TO THE THREAT FOR PURPOSES OF DECEPTION. THE DRFM (DIGITAL RF MEMORY) IS ONE PARTICULAR TYPE OF STORAGE DEVICE WHICH MAKESCOHERENT JAMMING MODULATION SCHEMES POSSIBLE. DRFM DEVICES,HOWEVER, ARE EXPENSIVE AND HAVE SEVERAL PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS. THESE LIMITATIONS ARE LARGELY DUE TO THE PRECEIVED REQUIREMENT OF A WIDE BANDWIDTH (E.G., 500 MHZ). THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO DETERMINE IF A NARROWER BANDWIDTH DRFM CAN ADEQUATELY SATISFY PERFORMANCE AND OPERATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS. THE PHASE I EFFORTWILL ANALYZE DRFM REQUIREMENTS FROM AN INTEGRATED SYSTEMS VIEWPOINT. THE STUDY WILL ESTABLISH THE DATA COLLECTION ANDCONTROL REQUIREMENTS FOR A RECEIVER/DRFM SYSTEM, AND PERFORMTHE ANALYSES TO DETERMINE HOW A NARROWBAND SYSTEM CAN SUCCEFULLY SUPPORT ECM REQUIREMENTS IN A REALISTIC AND DENSE COMBAT SIGNAL ENVIRONMENT. STUDY EFFORTS WILL DESCRIBE THE SIGNAL ENVIRONMENT THE DRFM JAMMER IS LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE, ANALYZE DATA COLLECTION AND CONTROL REQUIREMENTS, AND FORMULATE AN IMPLEMENTATION SCHEME BASED ON THE ADVANCED RECEIVER PROCESSOR SYSTEM PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED BY AMHERST SYSTEMS.",

OPTICAL INTERCONNECT REQUIREMENTS, IN GENERAL, CAN BE DIVIDED INTO FOUR AREAS: DEVICES, ROUTING MECHANISMS, PACKING TECHNIQUES, AND ARCHITECTURE DEVELOPMENTS. IN PARTICULAR, DEVICES WHICH CAN TRANSFORM ELECTRICAL SIGNALS TO TOPICAL SIGNALS AND VICE VERSA (SEMICONDUCTOR DIODE LASERS, LIGHT EMITTING DIODES, DETECTORS) ARE REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT OPTICAL INTERCONNECTS. LOW THRESHOLD HIGH SPEED LASERS BEYOND THE CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART ARE REQUIRED TO ADDRESS SPEED, AND LARGE FANOUT PROBLEMS. IN PHASE I OF THE PROPOSED EFFORT WE PROPOSE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A HIGH SPEED DIRECT CURRENT MODULATION MQW LASER BASED UPON OUR UNIQUE APPROACH OF REDUCING THE DEVICE CAPACITANCE BY USING SEMI-INSULATING SUBSTRATES AND ETCHING THE BOTTOM N + CONDUCTION LAYER FROM UNDER THE TOP CONTACT PAD. TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, SUCH AN APPROACH HAS NEVER BEEN TRIED BEFORE. WE FEEL THIS DECREASE OF CAPACITANCE WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASE OF THE MAXIMUM RELAXATION OSCILLATION FREQUENCY. THE FIRST PHASE WILL CONSIST OF PERFORMING REQUIREMENTS AND DESIGN ANALYSIS, FABRICATING LASERS OF SI AND N + SUBSTRATES AND COMPARING THEIR RELAXATION OSCILLATION FREQUENCIES TO PROVE THE VALIDITY OF OUR TECHNICAL APPROACH. THE SECOND PHASE WILL BE AIMED AT DEVICE OPTIMIZATION, PACKAGING ISSUES, BUILDING AND TESTING A DEMO MODEL FOR DEMONSTRATING THE HIGH DENSITY ELECTRONIC PACKING APPLICATION.",

BRAGG CELLS, HOWEVER, ARE LIMITED BY THEIR SMALL ANGULAR RANGE, LOW SCAN SPEED, AND HIGH POWER REQUIREMENTS. WE THEREFORE PROPOSE AN ADVANCED INTEGRATED ACOUSTO-OPTIC LASER SCANNER WHICH WILL LARGELY OVERCOME THESE LIMITATIONS. OUR PROPOSAL INTRODUCES SEVERAL INNOVATIONS. FIRST, WE PROPOSE USING MICROWAVE FREQUENCY (1-3 GHZ) SURFACE ACOUSTIC WAVES (SAWS) ON PIEZOELECTRIC THIN FILM AIN WAVEGUIDES WITH BROADBAND BRAGG PHASE MATCHING TO INCREASE THE FIELD OF VIEW AND IMPROVE THEOVERLAP BETWEEN ACOUSTIC AND OPTICAL GUIDED WAVES. SECOND, WE PROPOSE CASCADING OF SAW GRATINGS TO FURTHER INCREASE THE FIELD OF VIEW. THIRD, WE PROPOSE USING A PHASE-LOCKED DIODE LASER ARRAY TO PROVIDE HIGH OPTICAL POWER (WATTS) WITHOUT THE NEED FOR A PRISM COUPLER OR WAVEGUIDE COLLIMATING LENS. LASTLY, WE NOTE THAT USING HIGH SPATIAL FREQUENCY SAW GRATINGS MAY ADMIT THE POSSIBILITY OF EFFICIENTLY DEFLECTING LIGHT OUT OF THE PLANE FOR TRUE TWO-DIMENSIONAL SCANNING. IN PHASE I, WE PROPOSE TO ANALYZE THE SAW LASER SCANNER CONCEPT AND TO EXPERIMENTALLY DETERMINE ACOUSTIC POWER REQUIREMENTS FOR EFFICIENT DEFLECTION OF AN ALGAAS LASER BEAM.",

BECAUSE MANY LONG-TERM DIABETIC PATIENTS CAN BE KETOTIC AND SUFFER FROM KIDNEY DYSFUNCTION, AN ACCURATE CREATININE TEST IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE. THE ASSAY WILL BE BASED ON IMMOBILIZING CREATININE AMIDOHYDROLASE AND HYDROLYZING CREATININE TO CREATINE. THE SAMPLE BEFORE AND AFTER HYDROLYSIS WILL BE MEASURED BY THE KINETIC JAFFE METHOD. THE DIFFERENCE IN RATES IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE CREATININE CONCENTRATION IN THE SAMPLE.

THE SUBCUTANEOUS SENSOR HAS LOWER RISKS COMPARED TO AN INTRAVENOUS SENSOR, SOIT IS CONSIDERED FOR LONG-TERM MONITORING PURPOSES. IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED THAT TEXTURED SURFACES ARE FAVORABLE FOR IMPLANTATION TO THE SOFT TISSUE DUE TO BETTER VASCULARIZATION IN THE VICINITY OF THE IMPLANT AND LOWER THICKNESS OF FIBROUS CAPSULE COMPARED TO SMOOTH-SURFACE IMPLANTS. TEXTURED ELECTRODES WILL BE DEVELOPED OUT OF PLATINUM BLACK SUSPENDED IN POLYSTYRENE. THIS KIND OF MATERIAL WILL ALLOW FOR THE ELECTRODE'S FABRICATION BY A THERMOCOMPRESSION MOLDING TECHNIQUE. THE STUDIES WILL INCLUDE OPTIMIZATION OF PLATINUM CONTENT IN SUSPENSION AND ELECTRODE STABILITY TESTS. IN PHASE II, A CLINICAL PROTOTYPE OF THE SUBCUTANEOUS ELECTROCATALYTIC SENSOR WILL BE DEVELOPED. THESTUDIES IN PHASE II WILL ALSO INCLUDE THE INTEGRATION PROCEDURE OF THE TEXTURED SENSING ELECTRODE WITH THE SENSOR'S OTHER ELEMENTS AND EXTENSIVE ANIMAL TESTS.",

SINCE NO MECHANICAL MOVING PARTS ARE EMPLOYED, IT IS INHERENTLY RUGGED. MOREOVER, IT CAN ACHIEVE HIGH VALUES OF HYDROGEN AND HELIUM THROUGHPUT WITH EXCELLENT FLEXIBILITY AND SPEED. A HIGH VACUUM PLASMA PUMPING METHOD, THE PLASMA VACUUM PUMP (PVP), THAT USES ELECTRON CYCLOTRON HEATING (ECH) TO ACHIEVE THESE INHERENT ADVANTAGES IN PRACTICE HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. A COMPLEMENTARY, NON-MECHANICAL PLASMA BOOSTER-PUMP STAGE CAN GREATLY EXTEND THE APPLICATION RANGE OF PLASMA PUMPING METHODS BY MATCHING THE PVP PUMPING SPEED AT HIGHER WORKING PRESSURES THAN ARE FEASIBLE FOR THE PVP. THE RESULTING PUMPING SYSTEM COULD BE COMPLETELY FREE OF SOURCES OF OIL STREAMING AND THUS PROVIDE A \"DRY\" SYSTEM. ADDITIONALLY, THE AUGMENTED PVP WOULD RETAIN THE INHERENT RUGGEDNESS AND CAPABILITY FOR RAPID UP-DOWN CYCLING OF THE LOW PRESSURE PVP. THE BOOSTER STAGE IS DESIGNED TO COMPRESS THE AXIAL PLASMA FLOW FROM THE PVP BY A FACTOR OF 500 TO 1,000. THIS PERMITS HIGH GAS THROUGHPUT AT WORKING PRESSURES UP TO 10 MTORR TO BE EXHAUSTED INTO A DRY MECHANICAL PUMP (E.G., A DIAPHRAGM PUMP), AT APPROXIMATELY 1 TORR.

CARBONCARBON COMPOSITES ARE ATTRACTIVE FOR THIS TEMPERATURE RANGE FROM THE DUE TO COMPATIBILITY BETWEEN REINFORCEMENT AND MATRIX, MATERIAL DENSITY, MELTING TEMPERATURE, MECHANICAL PROPERTIES, RESISTANCE TO THERMAL SHOCK, COST, AND AVAILABILITY. THE ONE MAJOR DEFECT IS OXIDATION OF CARBON, LEADING TO EROSION OF THE STRUCTURE, AND RAPID LOSS OF STRENGTH. THE PROPOSED EFFORT WOULD DEVELOP A CARBON-CARBON COMPOSITE WHICH UTILIZES A HIGHLY EXIDATION-RESISTANT DOPED CARBON FIBER WHICH IS SUBSEQUENTLY COATED WITH A THIN SIC LAYER, AND INCORPORATED INTO A CARBON-CARBON COMPOSITE, THE MATRIX OF WHICH IS SIMILARLY TREATED WITH ADDITION OF BORON, AND FINALLY EXTERNALLY COATED WITH A SIC LAYER. THIS APPROACH OFFERS THE POTENTIAL FOR A HIGH STRENGTH, STABLE COMPOSITE FOR TEMPERATURES UP TO AT LEAST 1750 C.",

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO DEVELOP A NOVEL FLUIDIZED BED HEAT EXCHANGER WHICH HAS SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER HEAT FLUXES THAN CONVENTIONAL HEAT EXCHANGERS. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE ADDITION OF A FLUIDIZED BED ON THE GAS-SIDE WILL INCREASE HEAT FLUX BY AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE. THE FLUIDIZED BED ALSO PROVIDES RESISTANCE TO FOULING. EXPERIMENTS WILL BE PERFORMED TO SELECT FLUIDIZED BED MATERIAL AND HEAT EXCHANGER GEOMETRY. CONSIDERATIONS IN BED MATERIAL SELECTION ARE MAXIMUM HEAT TRANSFER COEFFICIENTS AND LOW PRESSURE DROPS. HEAT EXCHANGER GEOMETRY SELECTION WILL BE BASED ON PREVENTION OF BED PARTICLE ELUTRIATION AND COMPACT AND SIMPLE CONSTRUCTION. AN ANALYTICAL MODEL WILL BE DEVELOPED TO PREDICT THE PERFORMANCE AS WELL AS AID IN THE DESIGN OF THE HEAT EXCHANGER.

MANAGEMENT DECISION MAKING IS OFTEN BASED ON INCOMPLETE AND UNCERTAIN INFORMATION AND ON BELIEFS AND KNOWLEDGE THAT ARE CHANGING OVER TIME. MANAGEMENT INVOLVES THE INTERACTION OF MULTIPLE AGENTS WITH DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES WHOSE CONCLUSIONS MAY BE CONFLICTING AND CONTRADICTORY. UNDERSTANDING OF PERSONAL INTERACTIONS IN MANAGEMENT INVOLVES CONCEPTS SUCH AS ABILITY, PERMISSIBILITY AND OBLIGATION. THE TRADITIONAL AI PLANNING PARADIGM REQUIRES PRECONDITIONS AND POSTCONDITIONS OF ACTIONS BE KNOWN. THIS PARADIGM IS NOT USEFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT PLANNING DOMAIN WHERE KNOWLEDGE IS INCOMPLETE, UNCERTAIN, AND BASED ON CHANGING BELIEFS ABOUT INTENTIONS, CAPABILITIES, OBLIGATIONS, ETC. OUR APPROACH TO THIS PROBLEM IS TO REPRESENT EPISTEMIC, MODAL, AND INTENTIONAL CONCEPTS AS EXTENSIONS OF FIRST ORDER LOGIC AND TO FORMULATE AUTOMATED PLANNING MODEL BASED ON DEDUCTIVE, PREDICTIVE AND HYPOTHETICAL REASONING STRATEGIES FOR THIS EXTENDED LOGIC.",

SMARTCHART IS A PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS NURSES AND PHYSICIANS TO ENTER REAL-TIME CLINICAL DATA INTO PC'S FROM THE BEDSIDE. THE PAPER CHART IS GENERATED THROUGHA MICROCOMPUTER RATHER THAN BY PEN OR DICTATION. DURING PHASE I, SMARTCHART WILL BE MODIFIED SO THAT THE THERAPY ENTRIES OF ALL PATIENTS REFER TO A CENTRAL LIST THATWILL AUTOMATICALLY EXPAND AS NEW DRUGS ARE USED AND ENTERED. A DRUG-MONITORING PROGRAM (SMARTDOSE) WILL BE DEVELOPED TO USE THE COMPLETE, ACCURATE, AND TIMELY CLINICALINFORMATION TO ESTIMATE PROPER DRUG DOSAGES AND TO MONITOR FOR POTENTIAL DRUG INTERACTIONS. EACH TIME A THERAPY IS CHANGED OR ENTERED, A PROGRAM WILL CALCULATE THE PROPER DOSAGE ACCORDING TO A NUMBER OF FORMULAS, DETERMINE WHETHER THERE ARE INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER DRUGS, AND DISPLAY MESSAGES IF THE DRUG PRESCRIPTION COULD CAUSE CLINICAL PROBLEMS. THE DATABASE WILL BE CREATED BY SIMPLIFYING THE STANFORD DRUG INTERACTION DATABASE AND ADDING GENERALLY ACCEPTED DRUGDOSING AND KINETIC FORMULAS FOR EACH DRUG TITLE. THE ACCURACY AND UTILITY OF MESSAGES WILL BE TESTED USING CLINICAL INFORMATION FROM A DIAYLSIS PATIENT POPULATION. IN PHASE II, NEURAL NETWORK SIMULATION PROGRAMS WILL BE TESTED TO SEE WHETHER PHYSICIANS AND NURSES COULD EVENTUALLY\"TRAIN\" A COMPUTER TO MONITOR DRUG USE IN THEIR OWN SPECIALTY UNITS AND HOSPITALS. BAYESIAN METHODS OF DRUG-DOSE CALCULATION AND PREDICTION WILL ALSO BE TESTED. IMPLANTABLE GLUCOSE SENSORS ARE REQUIRED FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES. SMALL-SIZED PROBES WOULD REDUCE DISCOMFORT AND HEALTH RISK TO THE USER. A NEW MICROELECTRODE IS PLANNED TO FULFILL THIS NEED. THE MICROELECTRODE WILL UTILIZE GLUCOSE OXIDASE AND WILL INCORPORATE CRUCIAL ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY OVER EXISTING ENZYME ELECTRODES. IT WILL OPERATE INDEPENDENTLY OF OXYGEN CONCENTRATION WITH MINIMUM INTERFERENCE FROM OTHER COMPOUNDSIN BLOOD, AND IT WILL NOT USE POTENTIALLY TOXIC REAGENTS. THE APPROACH INVOLVES ENTRAPMENT (IMMOBILIZATION) OF GLUCOSEOXIDASE ONTO A THIN FILM OF AN ELECTRONICALLY CONDUCTING ARGONIC POLYMER (I.E., AN \"ORGANIC METAL\"). A FUNDAMENTALLYNEW METHOD FOR THE FORMATION OF CONDUCTING POLYMERS HAS BEENDEVISED BY LYNNTECH, INC. THIS NEW METHOD IS IDEALLY SUITEDFOR ENZYME IMMOBILIZATION ONTO MICROELECTRODES.

IN THIS SYSTEM SOLAR RADIATION IS COLLECTED BY CONCENTRATOR PANEL CONSISTING OF A MATRIX OF LENSES OR MIRRORS. THE OW CONSISTING OF OPTICAL FIBERS AND OTHER OPTICAL COMPONENTS TRANSFERS THE CONCENTRATED SOLAR RADIATION TO A CENTRAL LOCATION WHERE THE SOLAR POWER IS CONVERTED TO ELECTRICITY OR OTHER FORMS OF USEFUL POWER WITHIN A SHIELDED ENCLOSURE. THE FLEXIBLE OW LINKAGE ALLOWS THE CONVERTER TO BE PLACED AT THE LOCATION WHICH IS BEST SUITED FOR EFFICIENT POWER GENERATION AND SECURELY PROTECTED AGAINST HOSTILE SPACE ENVIRONMENTS. AN EXPLORATORY RESEARCH PROGRAM PERTAINING TO THE BASIC FEASIBILITY OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM WAS RECENTLY INITIATED UNDER AFAL SUPPORT. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE TIMELY DEVELOPMENT OF THIS UNIQUE CONCEPT, WE PROPOSE A PROGRAM TO DEVELOP A PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) POWER GENERATOR FOR THE OW SOLAR POWER SYSTEM. THE SCOPE OF THE PHASE I IS TO ESTABLISH THE DATABASE, OPTIMIZE THE COMPONENT PERFORMANCE, CONCEPTUALIZE AND EVALUATE THE PV POWER GENERATOR SYSTEM DESIGN. THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES OF THE PHASE I RESEARCH WILL PERTAIN TO SPACECRAFT POWER REQUIREMENTS, PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS OF PV CELLS, CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF PV GENERATOR, EVALUATION OF PV GENERATOR AND PROOF OF PRINCIPLE MODEL DESIGN.",

THE ETIOLOGY OF AD IS UNKNOWN, BUT ITS TWO BIOCHEMICAL HALLMARKS ARE THE PRESENCE OF EXTRACELLULAR PLAQUE AND INTRACELLULAR NEUROFIBRILLARY TANGLES (NFT) IN THE BRAINS OF AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS. THE GROSS CELLULAR DISTORTIONS ACCOMPANYING THE ACCUMULATIONOF INTRANEURONAL NFT UNDOUBTEDLY DISRUPT CYTOSKELETAL ARCHITECTURE AND CELLULAR TRANSPORT AND CONTRIBUTE TO NEURONAL DEATH. THE MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PHOSPHOPROTEIN TAU PROMOTES THE ASSEMBLY OF TUBULIN INTO MICROTUBULES, AND TAU HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE THE MAJOR ANTIGENIC COMPONENT OF NFT; HOWEVER, THE STRUCTURAL ALTERATIONS IN TAU RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS INCORPORATION INTO NFT ARE UNKNOWN. IN PHASE I, IT IS PLANNED TO ISOLATE TAU FROM AD AUTOPSIED BRAINS AND CHARACTERIZE THESE DISEASE-SPECIFIC MODIFICATIONS. THE ELUCIDATION OF THESE ALTERATIONS WILL SHED GREATER LIGHT ON THE ABERRANT BIOCHEMICAL EVENTS LEADING TO NEURONAL DESTRUCTION IN AD AND MAY HAVE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS IN OTHER AGE-RELATED NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES WHERE NFT FORMATION IS SYMPTOMATIC.

NEURAL NETWORKS OFFER THE PROMISE OF PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS TO COMPUTER-BOUND PROBLEMS. ATLANTIC HAS BEEN PERFORMING LOW LEVEL FEATURE EXTRACTION USING NEURAL NETS, AND HAS BEEN DEVELOPING A FEATURE EXTRACTOR WHOSE GOAL IS THE RELIABLE DETECTION OF PERCEPTUALLY IMPORTANT PHYSICAL FEATURES IN A PARALLEL FASHION. OUR JET-BASED SINGULARITY NETWORK ACHIEVES THIS BY USING FUNDAMENTAL CONSTRAINTS UPON THE RANGE OF POSSIBLE SIGNIFICANT IMAGE FEATURES. THE MANNER THAT THE NETWORK FORMS THESE FEATURES LEADS TO A SIMPLE AND NATURAL SYMBOLIC REPRESENTATION. WE PROPOSE TO EXTEND UPON OUR NEURAL NETWORK WORK IN SINGULARITY EXTRACTION TO INCORPORATE THE INFORMATION FROM SENSORS, SUCH AS PASSIVE INFRARED AND LASER RADAR INTENSITY, WHICH INHERENTLY PRODUCE AREA INFORMATION. IN OUR PROPOSED APPROACH, THIS LOW LEVEL PIXEL ORIENTED DATA WILL BECOME THE FIRST STAGE OF A NEURAL NET PROCESSING HIERARCHY WHICH DEVELOPS PROGRESSIVELY MORE COMPLEX FEATURES FROM THE SENSOR DATA, AND FINALLY USES A NETWORK BASED THREE DIMENSIONAL MODEL TO ACHIEVE THE FINAL IDENTIFICATION OF THE OBJECT. THIS PROCESSING HIERARCHY WILL ALLOW FOR THE FUSION OF INPUT FROM MULTIPLE SENSORS AND ALLOW TARGET IDENTIFICATION WITHOUT DIRECTION CONSTRAINTS WHILE PROVIDING THE CAPABILITY FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF MULTIPLE OBJECTS IN A SINGLE IMAGE.",

THE TOXICOLOGY OF NICKEL, IN ELEMENTAL AND METALLO-ORGANIC FORM, HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF MUCH ATTENTION IN RECENT YEARS. NICKEL HAS BEEN IMPLICATED IN NUMEROUS CARCINOGENIC, MUTAGENIC, METABOLIC, AND EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES. AS THE KNOWLEDGE OF BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS EXPANDS, THE DESIRE TO CHARACTERIZE THE ROLE OF NICKEL AND OTHER METALS AT INCIPIENT AND MICROSCOPIC LEVELS INCREASES ACCORDINGLY. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN RESONANCE IONIZATION SPECTROSCOPY PORTEND A QUANTUM LEAP IN SENSITIVITY FOR TRACE METALS. THE SELECTIVITY AND SENSITIVITY OF RESONANCE IONIZATION SUGGEST THAT ABSOLUTE SENSITIVITIES OF A FEW THOUSAND ATOMS MAY BE ACHIEVED FOR NICKEL, WITH THE ATTENDANT BENEFITS OF REDUCED SAMPLE PREPARATION, ISOTOPE DILUTION RELIABILITY, AND MULTIELEMENT POTENTIAL. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF PHASE I ARE TO: INVESTIGATE RESONANCE IONIZATION SCHEMES FOR NICKEL, DEVELOP SIMPLIFIED SEPARATIONMETHODS FOR NICKEL IN BIOLOGICAL MATRICES, INVESTIGATE ATOMIZATION METHODS FOR NICKEL, AND DEMONSTRATE ULTRASENSITIVE NICKEL ANALYSES. IN PHASE II THE METHODOLOGYWILL BE EXTENDED TO OTHER TOXIC ELEMENTS, AND A COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH PROGRAM WILL BE ESTABLISHED TO INTEGRATE THE TECHNOLOGY INTO THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY.",

THE PRESSURE PULSE FREQUENCY IS A LINEAR FUNCTION OF FLOW RATE IN A VORTEX SWIRL METER. THE PRESSURE SENSOR ITSELF WILL CONSIST OF A DEVICE ALREADY PARTIALLY DEVELOPED UNDER A 1986 SBIR PHASE I PROGRAM FROM NASA LEWIS. THE APPLICATION OF SIMILAR SENSORS TO VORTEX SWIRL FLOW MEASUREMENT HAS ALREADY BEEN DEMONSTRATED BY AURORA OPTICS PERSONNEL. IN THIS PROGRAM, HOWEVER, WE WILL CREATE A PASSIVE OPTICAL DEVICE, ADDRESSED SOLEY BY OPTICAL FILES, WHICH WILL UTILIZE OUR EXISTING GENERIC ELECTRONIC INTERFACEUNIT. THE RESULTING FLOW METER, FURTHER, WILL BE TESTED OVER A RANGE OF FLOW RATES DETERMINED IN CONSULTATION BY NASA AND OVER A RANGE OF TEMPERATURES FROM -55 TO +150. THIS INNOVATION WILL LEAD DIRECTLY TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ALL-OPTICAL FLIGHT DATA AND ENGINE CONTROL INSTRUMENTATION FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE AIRCRAFT. THIS PROPOSAL IS ALSO RELEVANT TO SUBTOPIC 03.06.",

THE HYDROGEN, OR OTHER LOW MOLECULAR WEIGHT COMPOUNDS, MAY PRODUCE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SPECIFIC IMPULSE BY DEPRESSING THE MOLECULAR WEIGHT OF THE COMBUSTION PRODUCTS. THE GOAL OF THIS EFFORT IS TO DEVELOP A CONCEPT THROUGH WHICH A STORABLE SYSTEM COULD BE USED TO INJECT A LIQUID OR GAS TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF A SOLID ROCKET. METHODS OF GENERATING A LOW MOLECULAR WEIGHT COMPOUND, SUCH AS HYDROGEN, IN A GASEOUS FORM FOR INJECTION INTO THE SOLID ROCKET EXHAUST GASES WILL BE DEVELOPED. SOME APPROACHES TO BE CONSIDERED FOR HYDROGEN GENERATION WILL BE: (1) REACTION OF AN ACID OR WATER WITH A METAL, (2) DECOMPOSITION OF A METAL HYDRIDE, OR (3) DECOMPOSITION OF AN ORGANIC HYDRIDE. THESE APPROACHES WILL RESULT IN ESSENTIALLY A SEPARATE GAS GENERATOR TO SUPPLY A LOW MOLECULAR WEIGHT COMPOUND TO THE SOLID PROPELLANT GRAIN. ANOTHER APPROACH IS DIRECT INJECTION OF A METALLIC HYDRIDE WHICH WOULD LIBERATE HYDROGEN DURING THERMAL DECOMPOSITION FOR MOLECULAR WEIGHT REDUCTION, WHICH MAY ALTER THE COMPOSITION OF THE PROPELLANT GRAIN. THE KEY ISSUES TO BE RESOLVED ON THE CONCEPTUAL LEVEL IN THIS EFFORT ARE THE FOLLOWING DETERMINATIONS: (1) THE OPTIMAL INJECTION FOR VARIOUS SOLID FUEL COMPOSITIONS, (2) A PRACTICAL MEANS OF PRODUCING AND INJECTING THE FLUID, AND (3) THE IMPACTS ON OVERALL VEHICLE PERFORMANCE.",

LASER CUTTING OF METALLIC MATERIALS IS FINDING INCREASING USE IN INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS BUT IS GENERALLY LIMITED TO THIN SECTIONS (5MM). THICKER-SECTION METAL CUTTING WITH LASERS SUFFERS FROM SEVERAL DRAWBACKS THAT INCLUDE LACK OF HEAT PENETRATION, LARGE KERF WIDTH, POOR CUT QUALITY, AND PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH MATERIAL REMOVAL AND HEAT TRANSFER. A THERMOCHEMICAL APPROACH INVOLVING THE APPLICATION OF TWO ADJACENT, HIGH-POWER LASER BEAMS IN GAUSSIAN ENERGY CONFIGURATION AND VARIOUS ORGANIC ASSIST GASES (C2H2, C3H8, AND C7H18) ALONG WITH OXYGEN IS PROPOSED TO EXTEND THE PERFORMANCE LIMITATIONS OF LASER CUTTING WITHOUT DETERIORATING THE CUT QUALITY. HEAT TRANSFER, FLUID FLOW, AND CHEMICAL REACTIONS PHENOMENA WILL BE UTILIZED TO DEVELOP THEORETICAL MODELS THAT WILL CLOSELY PREDICT THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS. THE MATHEMATICAL APPROACHCOMBINED WITH THE PROPOSED EXPERIMENTS WILL PROVIDE VALUABLEINSIGHT INTO THE NATURE OF PHYSICAL PHENOMENA, FACILITATING EFFICIENT LASER CUTTING OF MATERIALS MUCH THICKER AND FASTERTHAN THOSE THAT ARE POSSIBLE CURRENTLY. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL BE PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE TO HIGH-TECHNOLOGY MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES THAT USE LASER MACHINING.",

TODAY'S DESIGN ENGINEERS ROUTINELY CONSIDER MEMBRANE-BASED UNIT OPERATIONS AS VIABLE ALTERNATIVES TO \"CONVENTIONAL\" SEPARATION TECHNOLOGIES. HOWEVER, THE INABILITY OF POLYMERIC MEMBRANES TO WITHSTAND HIGH-TEMPERATURE (>100 DEGREES CENTIGRADE) OR CHEMICALLY HARSH ENVIRONMENTS DEPRIVES MANY INDUSTRIES OF THE KEY ADVANTAGES OF MEMBRANE TECHNOLOGY. CURRENTLY AVAILABLE POLYMERIC MEMBRANES ARE NOW USED IN SOME OF THESE HARSH SETTINGS, BUT THEIR CHARACTERISTIC COST- AND ENERGY-EFFICIENCIES ARE OFFSET BY THE NEED FOR EXPENSIVE PRETREATMENT OF CHEMICALLY DESTRUCTIVE PROCESS STREAMS OR BYTHE NEED TO DRASTICALLY COOL HOT FEED STREAMS. FOR MOST PROCESSES, SUCH PRETREATMENT IS IMPRACTICAL OR ALTOGETHER IMPOSSIBLE. MOREOVER, NON-POLYMERIC MEMBRANES (E.G., CERAMIC) THAT ARE NOW AVAILABLE FOR USE IN THESE CHALLENGINGAPPLICATIONS ARE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE, DIFFICULT TO MODULARIZE, AND PRONE TO IRREVERSIBLE FOULING. THE RESEARCHERS WILL INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY OF USING A GROUP OF ROBUST POLYMERS TO PREPARE MEMBRANES CAPABLE OF WITHSTANDING UP TO 300 DEGREES CENTIGRADE IN CHEMICALLY CHALLENGING OPERATIONS. THE GOAL OF PHASE I IS TO EVALUATE AND SCREEN THESE POLYMERS AND SELECT ONE OR MORE POLYMERS FOR USE IN MEMBRANES SUITABLE FOR APPLICATION TO HOT (>100 DEGREES CENTIGRADE) AND/OR CHEMICALLY HARSH INDUSTRIALSTREAMS. THESE POLYMERS WILL BE SYSTEMATICALLY TESTED TO DETERMINE THE DIFFUSION PROPERTIES OF VARIOUS GASES AND LIQUIDS.",

SEVERAL COATING COMPOSITIONS HAVE BEEN TESTED AND FOUND TO ABSORB GREATER THAN 99% AT 1.06 AND 10.6 MICRONS, WAVELENGTHS WIDELY UTILIZED BY LTI SYSTEMS. THESE COATINGS HAVE EXCELLENT WEAR AND ADHERENCE PROPERTIES, ARE INEXPENSIVE, CAN BE APPLIED TO A VARIETY OF ASSETS AND WOULD NOT INTERFERE WITH THE ASSETS FUNCTION.

PREVIOUSLY PROPOSED NECK PROTECTION SCHEMES PRIMARILY RELY UPON LIMITING HEAD DISPLACEMENTS, LEADING TO UNACCEPTABLE OPERATIONAL LIMITATIONS. THE PROPOSED EFFORT WILL ESTABLISH A SYSTEM DESIGN CONCEPT, INCLUDING BASIC SYSTEM DESIGN CRITERIA, FOR AN ACTIVE NECK PROTECTION DEVICE SUITABLE FOR USE BY HIGH PERFORMANCE AIRCRAFT CREWMEMBERS. THE SYSTEM WILL DETERMINE POTENTIALLY INJURIOUS HEAD AND NECK MOTIONS AT THEIR ONSET AND PROVIDE SUITABLE ALTERNATE LOAD PATHS TO ACCOMPLISH HEAD SUPPORT AND NECK PROTECTION. DURING THOSE TIMES WHEN INJURIOUS MOTIONS ARE NOT OCCURRING, THE PROPOSED SYSTEM WILL PROVIDE IVRTUALLY UNRESTRICTED HEAD AND NECK MOTION. THE PROPOSED EFFORT WILL UTILIZE COMPUTER SIMULATION WITH A SUITABLE HEAD-NECK MATHEMATICAL MODEL TO ENSURE THAT SYSTEM DESIGN CRITERIA WILL MEET OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE HIGH PERFORMANCE AIRCRAFT MANEUVERS.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE IGF-CP FOUND IN THE WOUND FLUID MAY HAVE DIFFERENT PROPERTIES (I.E., STABILITY, AFFINITY FOR IGF) FROM THAT FOUND IN THE SERUM. SEVERAL TISSUES AND CELL LINES THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO PRODUCE IGF-CP'S AS WELL AS IGF'S WILL BE THE SOURCES FOR THE POTENTIAL IGF-CP VARIANTS. TO TEST THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS APPROACH, CDNA LIBRARIES CORRESPONDING TO SEVERAL HUMANTISSUES AND CELL LINES WILL BE OBTAINED OR CONSTRUCTED AND RAPIDLY SCREENED FOR THE PRESENCE OF IGF-CP GENES VIA PCR AMPLIFICATION DURING PHASE I. IGF-CP GENES WILL BE ISOLATEDFROM THESE LIBRARIES, CHARACTERIZED, AND COMPARED AT THE DNASEQUENCE LEVEL. DURING PHASE II, VARIANT GENES WILL BE EXPRESSED AND THEIR PRODUCTS TESTED FOR THEIR ABILITY TO FUNCTION AS IGF-CP'S.",

RECENTLY, THE MEDICAL ULTRASOUND COMMUNITY HAS WITNESSED A GREAT DEAL OF EFFORT IN THIS AREA. HOWEVER, TO DATE ALL THE REPORTED TECHNIQUES ARE EITHER SUITABLE ONLY FOR TRANSMISSION MODE OR REQUIRE A MULTITUDE OF ULTRASOUND BEAMSOR FREQUENCIES (OR BOTH). THESE ARE, OF COURSE, SEVERE SHORTCOMINGS AS FAR AS CONVENTIONAL PULSE/ECHO B-MODE ULTRASOUND IS CONCERNED. IT IS PLANNED TO UNDERTAKE A PROGRAM TO DEVELOP A NOVEL SYSTEM THAT (1) OPERATES IN REFLECTION, (2) USES ONLY ONE ULTRASOUND BEAM, AND (3) OPERATES WITH ONLY ONE FREQUENCY. THIS APPROACH IS BASED ON VARIABLE AMPLITUDE EXCITATION. THE ECHO AMPLITUDES WILL BE MEASURED AT A FIXED POINT OF THEA-LINE FOR PROGRESSIVELY INCREASING EXCITATION AMPLITUDES. ANY DEVIATION FROM LINEARITY BETWEEN THE EXCITATION AMPLITUDE AND THE ECHO AMPLITUDE THEN SERVES AS A MEASURE OFTHE INTEGRATED NONLINEARITY BETWEEN THE TRANSDUCER AND THE DEFINED POINT ON THE A-LINE. DURING PHASE I, IT IS PLANNED TO COMPLETE THE INSTRUMENTATION OF A MECHANICALLY SCANNED SYSTEM AND DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS CONCEPT. SPECIAL-PURPOSE IMAGING HARDWARE, BASED ON ELECTRONIC SCANNING, WILL BE DEVELOPED IN PHASE II.",

A CURRENT VERSION OF THIS IMMUNOSENSOR HAS THE DETECTING REAGENTS ENVELOPED IN A SEMIPERMEABLE MEMBRANE. ACHIEVEMENT OF THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROJECT WILL ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR THIS MEMBRANE AND WILL DEMONSTRATE A SENSOR WITH IMPROVED PERFORMANCE (FASTER RESPONSE AND REGENERATION AS WELL AS INCREASED SENSITIVITY, PARTICULARLY WHEN RAPID ANALYSES ARE REQUIRED). DEMONSTRATING SENSOR FEASIBILITY WITH TOLUENE (OR DERIVATIVES) WILL SUPPORT THE UTILITY OF THIS TECHNOLOGY FORSENSITIVE , RAPID, AND SELECTIVE SENSING AND MONITORING OF VARIOUS ADVERSE AGENTS. THE SENSOR DEVICE WILL REVERSIBLY RECOGNIZE AND QUANTITATE ANALYTE CONTENT IN BATCH OR CONTINUOUS SAMPLING SITUATIONS AND TRANSDUCE THE SIGNAL WITHELECTRONIC DATA RECORDING AND TRANSMISSION. SUCH A DEVICE WOULD OFFER A BROAD RANGE OF APPLICABILITY FOR PERIODIC SAMPLE ANALYSIS AND REAL-TIME, ON-LINE MONITORING OF FLUIDS (AIR, WATER, AND FUELS) AS WELL AS DOSIMETRY MEASUREMENTS INAIR AND PHYSIOLOGICAL FLUIDS.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         RECENTLY, MUCH ATTENTION HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON THE USE OF ILLICIT AND/OR DESIGNER DRUGS BY PEOPLE FROM ALL FACETS OF AMERICAN LIFE. ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR OF THE DESIGNER DRUGS ARE THE FENTANYLS WHICH ARE VERY POTENT AND VERY DIFFICULT TO DETECT IN BIOLOGICAL FLUIDS. THESE POTENT DRUGS ARE BEING USED BY PEOPLE FROM ALL SEGMENTS OF OUR SOCIETY INCLUDING HEALTH CARE WORKERS, MILITARY PERSONNEL, AND PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES. BECAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM, MANY COMPANIES, INCLUDING THE U.S. MILITARY, ARE NOW BEGINNING TO DEMAND THAT EMPLOYEES SUSPECTED OF DRUG USE UNDERGO DRUG TESTING. A VARIETY OF METHODS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE SPECIFIC AND SENSITIVE DETERMINATION OF FENTANYLS IN BIOLOGICAL FLUIDS. HOWEVER, MOST OF THE AVAILABLE ASSAYS (I.E., GC, GC-MS) REQUIRE EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT, TRAINED PERSONNEL, AND ARE SLOW IN DETERMINING IF FENTANYLS HAVE BEEN CONSUMED. USE OF RADIOIMMUNOASSAY (RIA) PROCEDURES PRODUCES THE ADDITIONAL PROBLEM OF RADIOACTIVE WASTE DISPOSAL WHICH IS PRESENTLY, AND WILL INCREASINGLY BECOME, A MAJOR PROBLEM IN THE FUTURE. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP AN ENZYME IMMUNOASSAY (EIA) WHICH WILL BE USEFUL FOR THE DETECTION OF LOW CONCENTRATIONS OF FENTANYL IN BIOLOGICAL FLUIDS BY HIGH VOLUME SCREENING FACILITIES. THIS ASSAY IS SIMPLE, INEXPENSIVE, RAPID, AND MAY ALSO BE ADAPTABLE FOR THE DETECTION OF OTHER ILLICIT DRUGS.",

THIS TECHNIQUE, WHICH HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO SIGNIFICANTLYSTABILIZE AN ENZYME TO STORAGE AT ELEVATED TEMPERATURES, WILL BE FURTHER DEVELOPED AND APPLIED TO STABILIZATION OF FUNCTIONING IMMOBILIZED ENZYMES AS USED IN BIOREACTORS. THE RATIONALE IS TO PROVIDE AN ENVIRONMENT FOR OPTIMAL STABILITY SURROUNDING THE ENZME, THEN TO BIND IT TOGETHER BY COPOLYMERIZATION TO OBTAIN A VERY LARGE MOLECULAR WEIGHT,BUT SOLUBLE ENZYME DERIVATIVE. THE CROSSLINKED ENZYME WILL THEN BE IMMOBILIZED AND TESTED FOR STABILITY. THE ENZYME TOBE STABILIZED IN THIS MANNER DURING THE PHASE I PROJECT IS BETA-GALACTOSIDASE (LACTASE), WHICH IS USED IN BIOREACTORS TO HYDROLYZE LACTOSE IN MILK OR WHEY TO EITHER MAKE DAIRY PRODUCTS USABLE BY PEOPLE WITH LACTOSE INTOLERANCE OR TO MAKE A WASTE PRODUCT OF THE CHEESE INDUSTRY INTO A USEFUL PRODUCT. THE GOAL OF THE PHASE I PROJECT IS TO DOUBLE THE OVERALL USE LIFE (TOTAL HYDROLYSIS CAPACITY) OF IMMOBILIZED LACTASE BY THIS STABILIZATION TECHNIQUE.",

THE MOST PRESSING ASPECT OFTHE PROBLEM IS THE RELATIVELY HIGH MORTALITY RATE OF 50 PERCENT, DUE PRIMARILY TO THE LATE DETECTION OF THE DISEASE. RESEARCH HAS DETECTED THE PRESENCE OF POTENT MUTAGENS IN FECES, AND THE STRUCTURE OF THESE COMPOUNDS, CALLED FECAPENTAENES, HAS BEEN ELUCIDATED. IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT THE PRESENCE OF THESE MUTAGENS IS DIRECTLY INVOLVED WITH NEOPLASTIC TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE COLON, BUT LARGE-SCALE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES HAVE NOT YET BEEN DONE TO ESTABLISH A CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP. THE PRESENT HIGH-PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY TECHNIQUEFOR FECAPENTAENE DETECTION IS QUITE SENSITIVE, BUT IT IS TOOCUMBERSOME IN TERMS OF SAMPLE PREPARATION AND THROUGHPUT TO UTILIZE IN LARGE-SCALE STUDIES. DEVELOPMENT OF AN IMMUNOASSAY BASED ON AN ENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY (ELISA) FORMAT WOULD GREATLY REDUCE THE COST OF ANALYSIS AND WOULD PERMIT ANALYSIS OF MUCH LARGER NUMBERS OF SAMPLES. ONCE THE CASUAL RELATIONSHIP IS ESTABLISHED, THE ELISA COULD BE USED FOR SCREENING HIGH-RISK INDIVIDUALS DURING ROUTINE PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS. DETECTION OF ELEVATEDLEVELS OF THE MUTAGENS WOULD PERMIT DIETARY MODIFICATION ANDCLOSER SCREENING FOR DETECTION OF THE ACTUAL DISEASE.",

IN ADDITION TO THE POTENTIAL USEFULNESS OF SUCH PROBES TO RESEARCH LABORATORIES, THEY SHOULD PROVE USEFUL IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF DIAGNOSTIC TESTS EMPLOYED BY CLINICAL LABORATORIES. THE PHASE I EFFORT WILL CONCENTRATE ON DEVELOPING PROCEDURESFOR GENERATING MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES AGAINST HHV-6 STRUCTURAL AND NONSTRUCTURAL ANTIGENS. THE PHASE II EFFORT WILL CONCENTRATE ON PRODUCING A BATTERY OF ANTIBODIES AND DEVELOPING ASSAY KITS FOR DIAGNOSING HHV-6 INFECTION.",

THE APPROACH TAKEN WILL BE TO EXAMINE THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ENZYME MEDIATED BIOCONVERSION OF A SUITABLE SUBSTRATE TO PHENYLACETYLENE. THE INITIAL STEP WILL BE THE ISOLATION FROM THE ENVIRONMENT OF MICROORGANISMS CAPABLE OF PARTIAL OR COMPLETE UTILIZATION OF PHENYLACETYLENE. STUDIES ON THE REACTIONS INVOLVED IN PHENYLACETYLENE BIOSYNTHESIS, WILL BE DETERMINED IN A CELL-FREE SYSTEM. THERE ARE NUMEROUS EXAMPLES IN THE LITERATURE OF ENZYME AND REACTION CONDITIONS BEING MODIFIED SUCH THAT NEW AND REVERSE REACTIONS CAN OCCUR.

CURRENTLY, BETA-GALACTOSIDASE, HORSERADISH PEROXIDASE, AND ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE ARE THE THREE MOST WIDELY USED ENZYMES IN THESE ENZYMES EACH HAVE THEIR RESPECTIVE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES. THE IDEAL ENZYME SHOULD HAVE VERY HIGH CATALYTIC EFFICIENCY AND BE ABLE TO USE LOW CONCENTRATIONS OF CHROMOGENIC OR FLUORESCENT SUBSTRATES THAT YIELD VERY LOW BLANK BACKGROUND. THIS IDEAL ENZYME SHOULD MAKE EIA'S MORE SENSITIVE AND RAPID. THE SHORT-TERM OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO GENERATE BETA-GALACTOSIDASE WITH HIGH CATALYTIC EFFICENCY. THE SPECIFIC AIMS ARE TO CHARACTERIZE THE POSSIBILITIES AND LIMITATIONS OF A PROMISING TECHNIQUE FOR ISOLATING ENZYMES OF DIFFERENT PROPERTIES, SUCH AS HIGH KCAT OR LOWER KM. IN PRELIMINARY STUDIES, THIS TECHNIQUE PRODUCED BETA-GALACTOSIDASE WITH HIGH KCAT. THE TECHNIQUE TO BE EMPLOYED INVOLVES SELECTIVE PROCEDURES FOLLOWING RANDOM MUTATION IN A CHEMOSTAT ENVIRONMENT. THIS APPROACH HAS THE ADVANTAGE OVER SITE-DIRECTED MUTAGENESIS IN THAT DETAILED STRUCTURAL INFORMATION ON THE ENZYME OF INTEREST IS NOT NECESSARY. MOREOVER, THE EVOLUTIONARY APPROACH PROPOSED MAKES AVAILABLE AN UNLIMITED REPERTOIRE OFMUTATIONS AND THEIR COMBINATIONS, RATHER THAN BEING LIMITED BY PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS AS TO THE OPTIMAL STRUCTURE DESIRED.",

A PRINCIPAL CONCERN IS CLUTTER DISCRIMINATION, AND MANAGEMENT, AND ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL CLUTTER DISCRIMINANTS IS DOPPLER. IF ONE CAN ELIMINATE OWNSHIP'S MOTION, CLUTTER CAN BE CHARACTERIZED AS HAVING ZERO VELOCITY OR ZERO RELATIVE DOPPLER. THE FIRST ASPECT OF THE PROJECT PROPOSED HERE, IS TO USE CLUTTER ITSELF AS A MECHANISM FOR ESTIMATING OWNSHIP'S MOTION RELATIVE TO THE BOTTOM. THIS IS A NEW IDEA IN ACOUSTICS, BUT IT HAS BEEN USED IN RADAR (PARTICULARLY SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADARS) FOR MOTION COMPENSATION FOR SOME TIME. WE PROPOSE TO USE APPROPRIATE ADAPTATIONS OF SUCH TECHNIQUES, FOR ACTIVE ACOUSTIC SURVEILLANCE. ANOTHER USE OF CLUTTER STATISTICS WHICH WE PROPOSE, IS IN THE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE TRANSMISSION CHANNEL. THESE CHANNELS ARE CHARACTERIZED AS HAVING ATIME SPREADING FUNCTION. FOR SOME CHANNELS THE SPREADING RESULTS IN DISCRETE MULTIPATHS TO AND FROM A GIVEN RANGE, FOR OTHERS THE TIME SPREADING IS NOT RESOLVED INTO DISCRETE MULTIPATHS BUT IS MORE A CONTINUOUS FUNCTION.

IN THE FUTURE THE QUANTITY WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE. AT THE SAME TIME THERE IS A REQUIREMENT TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE DATA WHICH IS STORED AND TRANSMITTED TO SUPPORT SURVEILLANCE OF NONTRADITIONAL SIGNALS AND TO MONITOR LONG RANGE ACTIVE SIGNALS. IT IS THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT PROPOSED HERE TO PROVIDE A METHOD TO MORE EFFICIENTLY MAKE USE OF STORAGE AND TRANSMISSION RESOURCES AND TO PROVIDE IMPROVED DATA FIDELITY. THIS IS TO BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF EFFICIENT DATA COMPRESSION ALGORITHMS, AND ACCOMPANYING MESSAGE FORMATS, WHICH CAN BE INTRODUCED DIRECTLY INTO THE EXISTING IUSS. THESE SAME ALGORITHMS AND TECHNIQUES HAVE BROAD APPLICABILITY TO THE TRANSMISSION OF DATA OF ALL TYPES. WE PROPOSE TO FIRST APPLY THE ALGORITHMS TO THE SURTASS SYSTEM, WHERE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS I DATA TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE WILL BE REALIZED.",

ONE POTENTIAL WAY OF INCREASING THEIR STRENGTH, BUT WITHOUT SERIOUSLY REDUCINGTHEIR WATER UPTAKE, IS TO FORM THE GEL NETWORK FROM TWO POLYMER SPECIES. ONE POLYMER COMPONENT WOULD BE CHOSEN TO GIVE GOOD WATER UPTAKE PROPERTIES, WHILE THE OTHER WOULD BE CHOSEN TO PROVIDE GOOD MECHANICAL STRENGTH. IN PHASE I, A NEW FAMILY OF HYDROGELS THAT INCORPORATE TWO POLYMERS IN THE GEL NETWORK WILL BE PREPARED AND CHARACTERIZED. PRELIMINARY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT STRONG, TRANSPARENT GELS WITH HIGH WATER CONTENT CAN BE PRODUCED USING THIS APPROACH. A FURTHER ADVANTAGE OF THE TECHNIQUE IS THAT IT DOES NOT REQUIRE THE REMOVAL OF ORGANIC SOLVENTS DURING THE PREPARATION. BOTH OF THE POLYMER COMPONENTS HAVEA GOOD HISTORY OF BIOCOMPATIBILITY. WHILE MANY OF THE PREPARATIVE DETAILS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE MATERIALS, MECHANICAL EVALUATIONS REMAIN TO BE DONE. IN PHASE I, BREWER SCIENCE, INC., WILL MEASURE THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THE NEW MATERIALS AND COMPARE THEM TO CONVENTIONAL HYDROGELS. HOW GEL COMPOSITION AFFECTS CLARITY, STRENGTH, AND WATER-UPTAKE PROPERTIES WILL ALSO BE ESTABLISHED.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS AIMED AT IMPROVING THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE EFFECT OF MICROGRAVITY ON VAPOR TRANSPORT AND CRYSTAL GROWTH. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO DESIGN AND OPTIMIZE SYSTEMATICALLY GROUND BASED EXPERIMENTS WHICH IS THE FOCUS OF THIS RESEARCH. THE PAST EXPERIMENTAL WORK ON THE SUBJECT HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT ON COMPOUNDS (I.E. HGI(2), GESE-GEI(4), GESE-XE). THE CHEMICAL COMPLEXITIES (BOTH IN VAPOR AND SOLID PHASE) INVOLLED IN THESE EXPERIMENTS MAKE IDENTIFICATION AND INTERPRETATION OF MICROGRAVITY EFFECTS OF TRANSPORT AND CRYSTAL GROWTH DIFFICULT. IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTOF NORMAL MICROGRAVITY AS VAPOR TRANSPORT AND CRYSTAL GROWTH, BRIMROSE PROPOSES A SIMPLER AND SCIENTIFICALLY STRONG EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEM. IN THIS SYSTEM TELLURIUM IS SUGGESTED AS A MODEL MATERIAL TO CARRY OUT RESEARCH ON PHYSICAL VAPOR TRANSPORT AND CRYSTAL GROWTH. TELLURIUM IS AN ELEMENT BELONGING TO GROUP VI OF THE PERIODIC CHART, HENCE IT IS CHEMICALLY SIMPLE AND DOES NOT INVOLVE COMPLEX VAPOR PHASE REACTIONS. MOREOVER, IT HAS A RELATIVELY LOW MELTING POINT (450 DEGREES CENTIGRADE) AND VAPOR PRESSURE SUFFICIENTLY HIGH TO CARRY OUT TRANSPORT AND GROWTH BY SUBLIMATION. ANOTHER INCENTIVE IS THE ATTRACTIVE APPLICATION OF HIGH QUALITY TELLURIUM CRYSTALS FOR ACOUSTO-OPTIC 10.6 UM LASER (CO(2)) BEAM MOULATORS AND STEERERS. THE RESEARCH INCLUDES A STUDY ON EFFECTS OF AMPOULE SIZE AND GEOMETRY, ORIENTATION WITH RESPECT TO GRAVITY AND TEMPERATURE GRADIENT IN HORIZONTAL AS WELL AS VERTICAL DIRECTION ON VAPOR TRANSPORT RATES ON CRYSTAL GROWTH. EXPERIMENTALLY TRANSPORT RATES WILL BE COMPARED WITH EXISTING THEORETICAL MODELS. THE VAPOR GROWTH CRYSTAL WILL BE CHARACTERIZED WITH RESPECT TO STRUCTURAL AND ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES.",

THIS PROJECT WILL ADDRESS THE SYNTHESIS OF RADIOCHEMICAL DETERGENTS OF ULTRAPURITY. THE APPROACH TO THE SYNTHESIS IS LABELING OF THE ALKYL INTERMEDIATE, WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO THE ALKYL MOIETY OF THE DETERGENT. THE LABELING WITH ISOTOPES ENHANCES THE PURIFICATION METHODOLOGY. THIS IS DUE TO THE CAPABILITY OF IDENTIFICATION, SEPARATION, AND ISOLATION OF LABELED DETERGENTS THROUGH RADIOCHROMATOGRAPHY USING RADIOISOTOPE DETECTORS. THESE CHROMATOGRAPHIC TECHNIQUES INVOLVE FRACTIONS COLLECTION, ALIQUOT SAMPLING, AND, FINALLY, POOLING FRACTIONS CONTAINING THE DESIRED PURE DETERGENT OF INTEREST.",

APPROXIMATELY 20 PERCENT OF THE MARRIED COUPLES IN THE UNITED STATES EXPERIENCE SOME FORM OF INFERTILITY. IN MANY CASES, THE CAUSE OF AN INFERTILE STATE IS DUE TO INADEQUATE OR INAPPROPRIATE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE BRAIN AND PITUITARY GLAND. INFERTILITY THAT IS THE RESULT OF INADEQUATE PITUITARY STIMULATION BY LUTEINIZING HORMONE-RELEASING HORMONE (LHRH) CAN BE REVERSED BY ADMINISTRATION OF EXOGENOUS LHRH. HOWEVER, LHRH ADMINISTRATION MUST BE IN A PULSED FASHION, AND PRESENT PROTOCOLS RELY ON I.V. LHRH DOSING USING INFUSION PUMPS FOR INTERMITTENT DELIVERY. WHILE THE RESULTSCAN BE ENCOURAGING, THE PATIENT'S LIFE STYLE IS SERIOUSLY COMPROMISED DURING THERAPY. THIS RESEARCH PROGRAM FOCUSES ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN IMPLANTABLE DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR INFERTILITY TREATMENT. THISSYSTEM RELIES ON A BIODEGRADABLE IMPLANT DESIGNED TO DELIVERLHRH IN PULSES. NO EXTERNAL MANIPULATION IS REQUIRED FOR LHRH RELEASE, AND NO INVASIVE PROCEDURES ARE NEEDED FOR REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT.

THE GYPSY MOTH CATERPILLAR HAS BECOME AN IMPORTANT PEST OF FOREST AND SHADE TREES WHICH HAS SPREAD RAPIDLY, ESPECIALLY WITH THE ADVENT OF THE INTERSTATE HIGHWAY INFRASTRUCTURE. SINCE THE NPV IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO ULTRAVIOLETRADIATION, THE SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION OF THIS VIRUS TO THE FIELD IS DEPENDENT UPON THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN EFFICIENT AND COST-EFFECTIVE DELIVERY SYSTEM. THIS SYSTEM WOULD ASSOCIATETHE VIRUS WITH A PROTECTIVE UV ABSORBER WHICH THEN COULD BE SPRAYED ONTO CATERPILLAR INFESTED TREES AND FORESTS AS DESIRED.",

PHASE I WILL EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF PREPARING COMPOSITE MEMBRANES FORMED WITH REGIONS OF HIGH SELECTIVITY FOR MODEL COMPOUNDS. SCREENING TESTS USING MODEL ORGANIC COMPOUNDS IN WATER WILL EXPERIMENTALLY EVALUATE THE APPROACH. SUCCESSFUL DEMONSTRATION OF ENHANCEDSEPARATION OF COMPLEX MIXTURES OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS WILL LEAD TO A PHASE II PROGRAM INVOLVING AN EXPANDED STUDY OF MIXTURE SEPARATIONS. PHASE II WOULD OPTIMIZE MEMBRANE FLUX WHILE RETAINING GOOD SELECTIVITY, MEASURE THE DURABILITY OF THE MEMBRANES, AND ASSESS THE OVERALL ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY OF THE USE OF THESE COMPOSITE MEMBRANES FOR COMMERCIAL SEPARATIONS.",

A NUMBER OF STRATEGIES DIRECTED AT REDUCING NOX EMISSIONS WOULD BENEFIT FROM REAL TIME NOX EMISSIONS MEASUREMENT SINCE THIS WOULD ALLOW FEEDBACK CONTROL OF THE PROCESS. CURRENT INSTRUMENTATION ALLOWS COST EFFECTIVE MONITORING OF VERY LARGE COMBUSTION PROCESSES AND NEW CATALYTIC TECHNOLOGY BEING DEVELOPED BY CATALYTICA SHOULD EXTEND THIS CAPABILITY TO MEDIUM SIZED STATIONARY COMBUSTION PROCESSES. HOWEVER, NO CURRENT TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS THE COST EFFECTIVE REAL TIME MONITORING OF SMALL STATIONARY AND MOBILE COMBUSTION PROCESSES. THIS SBIR PROGRAM PROPOSES TO EXTEND CATALYTIC SENSOR TECHNOLOGY TO THIS SEGMENT BY REDUCING THE SIZE AND COST OF PROTOTYPE NOX SENSORS. SILICON MICROMACHINING AND NEW SENSOR DESIGN WILL BE USED TO REDUCE SENSOR SIZE, POWER REQUIREMENTS AND COST. THE PHASE I PROGRAM WILL BE DIRECTED AT THE PROOF OF PRINCIPLE OF THE BASIC SENSOR DESIGN AND WILL DEMONSTRATE AN EXPERIMENTAL SENSOR. THE PROGRAM OBJECTIVE IS A SMALL DURABLE SENSOR FOR NO AND NO2 WITH A RANGE OF 0-500 PPM AND A LIFE OF ONE YEAR IN THE HARSH ENVIRONMENTAL OF A COMBUSTION EXHAUST GAS.",

THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THE RESEARCH PROGRAM ARE TO DETERMINE OPTIMAL METHODS FOR: (1) COUPLING BIOTIN TO SYNTHETIC NEUROPEPTIDES WITHOUT CHANGING THEIR RECEPTOR AFFINITY; (2) IMMOBILIZING THE DERIVATIZED LIGAND, IF NECESSARY, ON THE BOUND RECEPTOR; AND (3) DETECTING THE BOUND LIGAND VIA ENZYME-LINKED, AVIDIN-BASED REAGENTS. THE PROGRAM WILL BE CARRIED OUT BY USING A NOVEL SITE-SPECIFIC BIOTINYLATION PROCEDURE TO SELECTIVELY LABEL AMINO ACIDS AT A NONCRITICAL REGION OF THE PEPTIDE LIGAND, WHICH WILL BE A BETA- ENDORPHIN IN THIS FEASIBILITY STUDY. RECEPTOR-BINDING STUDIES WILL THEN BE CARRIED OUT USING RAT BRAIN MEMBRANE PREPARATIONS OR HISTOLOGICAL SECTIONS. USINGAVIDIN-BIOTINYLATED HORSERADISH PEROXIDASE AS THE DETECTION REAGENT, BINDING WILL BE DETECTED SPECTROPHOTOMETRICALLY (MEMBRANE ASSAYS) OR BY LIGHT MICROSCOPY (HISTOCHEMICAL ASSAYS). BECAUSE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL AND CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF RECEPTOR BIOLOGY, THERE IS A VERY LARGE USER BASE FOR RADIOLABELED RECEPTOR LIGANDS. HOWEVER, THE INTRODUCTION OFUSEFUL NONRADIOACTIVE LIGANDS WOULD PROVIDE SAFER, LESS EXPENSIVE, AND MORE STABLE REAGENTS FOR RECEPTOR STUDIES.",

IT REQUIRES A LARGE AREA RATIO NOZZLE WHOSE WALLS ARE VENTED THROUGH A SERIES OF SPRINGLOADED CHECK VALVES. THIS ALLOWS CONTINUOUS AND PASSIVE ADJUSTMENT OF EXHAUST TO AMBIENT PRESSURES AND ALSO REDUCES THE TRANSIENT START LOADS ON THE NOZZLE. IN PHASE I OF THIS PROJECT, AN EXISTING CFD CODE WILL BE USED TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY OFTHE BASIC CONCEPT. A SPACECRAFT NOZZLE, SUCH AS THE SSME NOZZLE, WILL BE ANALYZED WITH SEVERAL VENT CONFIGURATIONS. BASIC PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS AND FLOW DISTRIBUTIONS WILL BE STUDIED FOR SEVERAL PRESSURE RATIOS TO SIMULATE OPERATION ATVARIOUS ALTITUDES. EFFECTS OF FLOW PROTRUSIONS, INTRODUCED UPSTREAM OF CHECK VALVES TO ENHANCE THE RELIABILITY OF THEIR OPERATION, WILL ALSO BE ANALYZED. IN PHASE II, OPERATIONAL QUESTIONS SUCH AS SIDE LOADS DUE TO FAILED VALVES WILL BE ANALYZED AND AN OPTIMUM NOZZLE DESIGN WILL BEDEVELOPED AND TESTED. THE ADAPTED CFD CODE WILL ALSO SERVE AS A VALUABLE DESIGN TOOL.",

ALSO, THE RESINSHRINKS AND SWELLS BECAUSE OF REABSORPTION OF WATER; THIS RESULTS IN DEFORMATION AND CRACKING OF THE CEMENT/RESIN SOLID. THE PRESENT METHOD WILL ELIMINATE THE ORGANIC COMPONENTS OF THE RESIN WASTE, REMOVE EXCESS WATER, AND RETAIN THE INORGANIC COMPONENTS. THE REMAINING MASS CAN BE CONTAINED IN A LEACH-RESISTANT SLAG OR GLASS, WHICH CAN BE READILY BLENDED WITH CEMENT TO FORM A STABLE LEACH- RESISTANT SOLID. REMOVAL OF THE WATER AND ORGANICS FROM THE SPENT RESIN RESULTS IN AT LEAST A TENFOLD REDUCTION IN THE VOLUME OF RESIN WASTE. THE ADVANTAGES OF THIS PROCESS ARE THAT IT: ELIMINATES THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH RESIN SHRINKAGE AND SWELLING; ELIMINATES ORGANICS AND WATER WHILE RETAINING INORGANICS, EFFECTIVELY REDUCING THE RESIN WASTE VOLUME; PROVIDES A MOBILE SYSTEM FOR ONSITE USE THAT CAN BE RUN IN BATCH OR CONTINUOUS MODE; AND IS AN ENERGY SELF-SUFFICIENT SYSTEM THAT CAN BE RUN ON A LARGE OR SMALL SCALE.

IT WILL IDENTIFY THE CRITICALOPERATIONAL PARAMETERS AND PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR DEVELOPING A SCALED-UP PROTOTYPE IN PHASE II.",

IN THE THEORETICAL APPROACH DESCRIBED HERE, THE COMPLEX PROCESS OF SURFACE HEATING IS BROKEN DOWN INTO ITS COMPONENTS WHICH ARESTUDIED INDEPENDENTLY WITHOUT THE COMPLICATIONS OF COMPETING PROCESSES. THE STUDIES OF THESE COMPONENTS ARE COMPRISED OF TWO PARTS: (1) CONSTRUCTION OF REALISTIC MODELSOF THE INTERACTION POTENTIALS AS A FUNCTION OF INTERNUCLEAR DISTANCES, AND (2) DYNAMICAL CALCULATIONS OF THE MOTION OF THE ATOMS USING THE POTENTIAL ENERGY SURFACES.

THE USE OF THIS TECHNIQUE HAS BEEN HAMPERED BY THE EXPENSE AND DIFFICULTY OF CUSTOM COUPLING SPECIFIC ANTIBODIES TO SILICA SUPPORTS. IN ADDITION TO THE DEMAND FOR PRODUCTION-SCALE ACTIVATED COLUMNS, BASIC RESEARCHERS HAVE EXPRESSED AN URGENT NEED FOR THIS TYPE OF ACTIVATED SILICA SUPPORT IN A SMALLER FORMAT. THIS RESEARCH WILL DEVELOP ACTIVATED SILICA SUPPORTS THAT WILL BE PREPACKED INTO COLUMNS AND USED FOR IMMOBILIZATION OF SPECIFIC ANTIBODIES BY THE CUSTOMER. PHASE I INCLUDES DEVELOPMENT OF PROTOCOLS FOR PREPARATION OF A NOVEL ACTIVATED SILICA SUPPORT, HYDRAZINE HIPAC, AND USE OF THIS SUPPORT TO IMMOBILIZE IGG VIA OLIGOSACCHARIDES ON THE ANTIBODY. IN PHASE II, PROTOCOLS FOR IMMOBILIZATION OF IGG ON COLUMNS PREPACKED WITH ACTIVATED SILICA WILL BE DEVELOPED.",

THE LOWEST MASS AND LOWEST COST METHOD FOR GENERATING ELECTRICAL POWER IN SPACE WILL LIKELY BE PYROELECTRIC CONVERSION. THIS MODE OF ELECTRICAL GENERATION WILL DOMINATE FOR TWO REASONS. FIRST, THE LOW MASS WILL MAKE IT THE LEAST EXPENSIVE TO PLACE IN ORBIT. SECONDLY, THE MATERIALS AND SYSTEM COSTS OF PYROELECTRONIC CONVERTERS ARE EXPECTED TO BEFAR LOWER THAN PHOTOVOLTAICS, NUCLEAR, AND CHEMICAL APPROACHES. ULTRA-LIGHTWEIGHT PYROELECTRIC CONVERTERS MAY ALSO MAKE HIGHER ORBITS ECONOMICALLY ACCESSIBLE BECAUSE ELECTRIC PROPULSION MAY BECOME FEASIBLE.

THE MLAB SYSTEM IS WIDELY USED BY MEDICAL RESEARCHERS, SCIENTISTS, AND STATISTICIANS. MANY MLAB USERSFIND CLAB OF OCCASIONAL USE, AND SOME FIND CLAB TO BE OF PRIMARY INTEREST. MLAB IS CURRENTLY BEING CONVERTED FOR USE ON PC/AT PERSONAL COMPUTERS UNDER THE PC-DOS OPERATING SYSTEM. HOWEVER, THIS CONVERSION DOES NOT INCLUDE THE CLAB OPERATORS. ONE AIM OF THIS PROJECT IS TO CONVERT THE EXISTING CLAB ALGORITHMS AND INTEGRATE THEM INTO PC-MLAB, WITH ENHANCEMENTS SUITABLE TO THE AT/DOS ENVIRONMENT. THE RESULTING SYSTEM WILL SERVE THENEEDS OF MLAB USERS AS DEC-10'S AND -20'S ARE PHASED OUT. IT WILL ALSO BE AVAILABLE FOR NEW USERS WHO HAVE NOT HAD ACCESS TO MLAB/CLAB. ANOTHER AIM IS TO STUDY EXTENSIONS OF THE CLAB SYSTEM TO OPTIMALLY SERVE CLASSES OF NEW USERS. SUCH CLASSES INCLUDE SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGISTS AND RESEARCHERS USING FLOW CYTOMETRY. THE LATTER IS PARTICULARLY OF NOTE, DUE TO THE IMPORTANCE OFFLOW CYTOMETRY IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF LEUKEMIA AND AIDS.",

THE GROWING NATIONAL NEED FOR IMPROVED PERFORMANCE OF PURIFICATION INVOLVING COAGULATION-FILTRATION COULD BEST BE HELPED BY USE OF AN AUTOMATED COAGULANT DOSE CONTROL INSTRUMENT. THE BEST TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE NOW IS STREAMING CURRENT DETECTORS. THEIR MAJOR SHORTCOMINGS--CONFUSION OVER WHAT THEY ACTUALLY MEASURE AND THE NEED FOR FREQUENT CALIBRATION BY SKILLED PROFESSIONALS--ARE PROBABLY THE REASONS THEY HAVE BEEN USED IN ONLY ABOUT 1% OF THE PLANTS WHICH COULD BENEFIT FROM A RELIABLE INSTRUMENT. CAPILLARY ZONE ELECTROPHORESIS (CZE), A NEW CHEMICAL ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE, OFFERS GREAT PROMISE AS A BASIS FOR AUTOMATED MEASUREMENT OF COLLOID PARTICLE CHARGE, ELECTROPHORETIC MOBILITY. THIS PROPOSAL WILL DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF USING CZE AS THE BASIS OF A NEW COAGULANT DOSE CONTROL INSTRUMENT. THE GOAL IS TO EVALUATE THE TECHNICAL SUITABILITY OF CZE FOR COAGULANT DOSE CONTROL THROUGH TWO MAJOR ACTIVITIES: (1) IMPROVE THE DESIGN OF AN EXISTING HI LO TECH, LTD. INSTRUMENT, AND (2) PERFORM TESTS IN THE LABORATORY AND IN AN OPERATING WATER TREATMENT PLANT. SOME MAJOR QUESTIONS THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED ARE: (1) HOW CAN POTENTIAL PROBLEMS SUCH AS TUBE PLUGGING, FOULING, AND GAS BUBBLE FORMATION BE SOLVED, (2) WHAT IS A SUITABLE DETECTOR, (3) WHAT ARE APPROPRIATE ON-LINE CALIBRATING CHEMICALS, (4) WHAT ARE THE DESIGN FEATURES NECESSARY FOR A RELIABLE, AUTOMATED INSTRUMENT, AND (5) APPROXIMATELY WHAT WOULD AN INSTRUMENT COST?",

IN SPITE OF MAJOR ADVANCES IN DIAGNOSTIC X-RAY, SURGERY, AND RADIATION THERAPY, LOCAL CONTROL OF THESE MALIGNANCIES CONTINUES TO BE A PROBLEM. IN 1985, THERE WERE7,400 DEATHS FROM CANCER OF THE CERVIX AND 3,200 DEATHS FROMCANCER OF THE ENDOMETRIUM. AS PART OF THE STANDARD TREATMENT FOR THE MORE ADVANCED CASES, HIGH-DOSE INTRACAVITARY IRRADIATION IS DELIVERED WITH A TANDEM AND COLPOSTAT. THIS DEVICE CAN BE SECURED IN POSITION IN THE ENDOMETRIAL CANAL AND SURROUNDING THE CERVIX SO THAT LOCAL, INTENSE IRRADIATION CAN BE DELIVERED. STILL, LOCAL FAILURESCONTINUE TO PLAGUE PATIENTS WITH MORE ADVANCED LOCAL DISEASE. THIS PROJECT WILL MODIFY CURRENT INTRACAVITARY APPLICATORS USED IN THE TREATMENT OF GYNECOLOGIC MALIGNANCIES TO MAKE POSSIBLE THE DELIVERY OF INTRACAVITARY HYPERTHERMIA THROUGH THE SAME DEVICES THAT ARE USED TO DELIVER INTRACAVITARY IRRADIATION. IT IS PLANNED TO MODIFY THESE APPLICATORS IN SUCH A WAY THAT LOCAL HYPERTHERMIA CAN ALSO BE DELIVERED IN AN ATTEMPT TO ACHIEVE BETTER LOCAL CONTROL. MICROWAVE AND ULTRASOUND HEATING DEVICES WILL BE INCORPORATED TO ACCOMMODATE A WIDE VARIETY OF CLINICAL SITUATIONS. IN PARTICULAR, THE TANDEM WILL BE MODIFIED TO ACCEPT AN AIR-COOLED MICROWAVE ANTENNA. THE COLPOSTATS (OVOIDS) WILL BE MODIFIED TO INCLUDE ULTRASOUND TRANSDUCERS OR MICROWAVE SPIRAL APPLICATORS.",

THE MOST COMMON VENTILATED WORK CHAMBERS IN USE ARE SPRAY BOOTHS FOR PAINTING. THE NEXT MOST COMMON VENTILATED WORK CHAMBERS ARE BOOTHS FOR THE LAY UP AND SPRAYING OF FIBERGLASS OR COMPOSITE PRODUCTS. THE VENTILATED WORK CHAMBER IS IMPROVED BY CONFINING A ZONE (OR PATH) OF FRESH VENTILATING AIR TO JUST A PORTION OF THE CROSS SECTION OF THE CHAMBER, AND PROVIDING MEANS FOR SHIFTING THE LOCATION OF THE VENTILATING AIR ZONE FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER IN THE CHAMBER, TO SERVE THE WORKER AS HE CHANGES HIS LOCATION.

AFC IS BASED UPON AN ADVANCED, INTEGRATED, INTERDISCIPLINARY COMBINATION OF TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING FLUIDIZED BED COMBUSTION, AERATED FLOW OF SOLIDS, AND CIRCULATION-LOOP GAS-SOLIDS CATALYTIC REACTOR TECHNOLOGIES. THE PROCESS RETAINS THE ADVANTAGES OFFLUIDIZED BED COMBUSTION, BUT ELIMINATES THE ELUTRIATION OF FINES FROM THE COMBUSTOR AND THE BYPASSING OF GASES WITHOUT COMPLETE COMBUSTION. THE AFC REPRESENTS A THIRD GENERATION OF THE FLUIDIZED BED COMBUSTION PROCESS. THE ADVANTAGES OF THE AFC PROCESS INCLUDE COMBUSTION EFFICIENCES THAT CAN, IN CONCEPT, APPROACH COMPLETE COMBUSTION. EXTREMELY LOW EMISSIONS OF SULFUR DIOXIDE, NITROGEN OXIDES, CARBON MONOXIDE, HYDROCARBONS, POLYAROMATIC HYDROCARBONS, AND CARBON-CONTAINING PARTICULATES ARE ALSO EXPECTED. THE AFC PROCESS IS EXCEPTIONALLY FLEXIBLE WITH RESPECT TO FUEL VARIABILITY AND CAN ACCOMMODATE LOW VALUE, HIGH ASH SOLID FUELS SUCH AS OIL SHALE, WOOD, OR MUNICIPAL REFUSE. IT IS PARTICULARLY WELL SUITED TO THE COMBUSTION OF SOLID OR LIQUID HAZARDOUS WASTES. PHASE I WILL COMPRISE A TECHNICAL EVALUATION AND FEASIBILITY STUDY; A COLD MODEL DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION, AND EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION STUDY; QUANTITATIVE DEVELOPMENT OF ENGINEERING CORRELATIONS BASED ON THEORY AND COLD MODEL DATA; AND PRELIMINARY DESIGN OF A SMALL PILOT FACILITY THAT WILL SERVE AS A FULLY OPERATIONAL SMALL COMMERCIAL UNIT, AS WELL AS AN INSTRUMENTED TESTING PROTOTYPE DURING PHASE II.",

IMPLEMENTING THIS NEW ARCHITECTURE FOR COINCIDENCE DETECTIONIN A VERY LARGE SCALE INTEGRATED (VLSI) CIRCUIT SHOULD NOT ONLY REDUCE THE SIZE AND COST OF THE CIRCUITRY, BUT SHOULD ALSO REDUCE THE LENGTH REQUIREMENTS OF AN EXPENSIVE HIGH SPEED CABLE. THE ARCHITECTURE IS PRACTICAL ONLY IN VLSI SINCE IT REQUIRES A LARGE NUMBER OF INTERNAL CONNECTIONS. HOWEVER, THE SILICON AREA NEEDED FOR MAKING THESE CONNECTIONS WILL BE MINIMIZED BY EMPLOYING NEAREST-NEIGHBOR COMMUNICATION WITHIN THE ARRAY OF MODULES. FURTHERMORE, THE ARCHITECTURE'S DESIGN COMPLEXITY WILL BE KEPT MANAGEABLE BY REPLICATING A SINGLE MODULE 56 TIMES WITHIN THE ARRAY. PHASE I WILL CONSIST OF MAPPING THE DESIRED FUNCTIONS INTO A SEMICUSTOM VLSI CIRCUIT AND COMPARING THIS IMPLEMENTATION WITH AN EXISTING DISCRETE IMPLEMENTATION. THE FEASIBILITY OF PROCEEDING ON TO DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE OF THE VLSI IMPLEMENTATION THEN WILL BE EVALUATED.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         MANY ADVANCES HAVE BEEN MADE IN COAL-WATER SLURRY FUEL (CWSF) BURNERS. THE POTENTIAL BENEFIT OF THIS METHOD OF BURNING COAL IS THAT THE BULK OF THE ASH AND SULFUR ARE REMOVED BEFORE THE COMBUSTION PROCESS, SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF SULFUR DIOXIDE PRODUCED. ALSO, BECAUSE LESS EXCESS AIR IS NEEDED FOR THIS TYPE OF BURNER, THE EFFICIENCY OF THIS TYPE OF COMBUSION IS INCREASED. HOWEVER, THE PRESENT METHOD OF DETERMINING WHETHER THE OPTIMAL AIR-TO-FUEL RATIO IS ACHIEVED USES A ZIRCONIUM OXIDETRIM SENSOR. THIS SENSOR QUICKLY IS CLOGGED WITH ASH PARTICULATE AND BECOMES INACCURATE. PRELIMINARY ACOUSTIC EMISSION INVESTIGATION ON BURNERS HAS REVEALED AN APPARENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE BURNERS' EXCESS FUEL CONDITION AND THE ACOUSTIC SIGNATURE. THIS INVESTIGATION WAS DONE ON GAS- AND OIL-FIRED BOILERS. THIS PROJECT WILL BEGIN BY GATHERING ACOUSTIC DATA FROM THE CWSF BOILER AT PENN STATE UNIVERSITY, AND WILL PERFORM EXTENSIVE SIGNATURE ANALYSIS OFTHE SOUND AND WAVE FORMS MEASURED. ASSUMING THAT THE RESULTS OF THE ACOUSTIC ANALYSIS ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE FOR OIL- AND GAS-FIRED BOILERS, A BRASSBOARD DEMONSTRATION ACOUSTIC FEEDBACK SYSTEM WILL BE INSTALLED ON THE COAL-WATERSLURRY BOILER. THE TIP OF THE ACOUSTIC SENSOR WILL BE CONNECTED TO AN ALUMINUM OXIDE ROD EXTENDING INTO THE HOT REACTION ZONE OF THE COMBUSTION FLAME. THE CWSF BURNER WILLBE OPERATED FOR APPROXIMATELY A WEEK TO DETERMINE THE POTENTIAL FEASIBILITY OF THIS NEW METHOD OF COMBUSTION INSTRUMENTATION. INITIAL LABORATORY DATA SUGGEST THAT AN ACOUSTIC EMISSION SENSOR MAY LAST CONSIDERABLY LONGER THAN AZIRCONIUM OXIDE OXYGEN TEIM SENSOR. THE R&D; LABORATORY AT PENN STATE HAS A ZIRCONIUM OXIDE SENSOR, AND IT WILL BE COMPARED ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO THE ACOUSTIC EMISSION TYPE SENSOR. THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF SOFTWARE AND CONTROL LOOP INVESTIGATION TO BE DONE INVOLVING THE EXISTINGCONTROLLER NOW ON THE PENN STATE BOILER. THIS SOFTWARE WORKWILL BE ACCOMPLISHED CONCURRENT WITH THE ACOUSTIC SIGNATURE ANALYSIS; THIS SHOULD BE READY AT THE SAME TIME AS THE DEMONSTRATION.",

EEG MONITORING IS DESIRABLE IN OPERATING ROOMS AND INTENSIVE CARE UNITS FOR RAPID DETECTION OF CHANGES IN NEUROLOGICAL FUNCTION, THUS PERMITTING IMMEDIATE INTERVENTION. EEG MONITORING IS ALSO USEFUL IN THE EVALUATION OF PATIENTS WITH EPILEPSY AND SLEEP DISORDERS. CONVENTIONAL PAPER EEG RECORDINGS ARE TOO CUMBERSOME AND DIFFICULT FOR THE NONELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHER TO INTERPRET TOBE PRACTICAL FOR USE IN CONTINUOUS MONITORING SETTINGS. A NUMBER OF EEG MONITORING DEVICES ARE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE,BUT NONE HAS GAINED WIDESPREAD ACCEPTANCE. PRESENTLY AVAILABLE EEG MONITORING SYSTEMS DO NOT EMPLOY METHODS OF EEG ANALYSIS ADEQUATE TO UNAMBIGUOUSLY IDENTIFY SIGNIFICANT EEG PATTERN CHANGES AND ARTIFACT. CORTEKS, INC., PLANS TO DEVELOP AN EEG MONITORING SYSTEM THAT WILL OVERCOME THESE LIMITATIONS BY UTILIZING A COMBINATION OF INNOVATIVE ALGORITHMS, INCLUDING AUTOREGRESSIVE (AR) SPECTRAL ANALYSIS OF EEG AND PARALLEL DISTRIBUTED PROCESSING (PDP) NETWORKS. IN PHASE I, THE AR METHODS BEST SUITED TO EEG SPECTRAL ANALYSIS WILL BE SELECTED, AND THE FEASIBILITY OF EEG PATTERN AND ARTIFACT RECOGNITION USING PDP NETWORKS WILL BE DEMONSTRATED. IN PHASE II, THESE METHODS WILL BE OPTIMIZED,AND CUSTOM HARDWARE NECESSARY FOR COMMERCIALIZATION WILL BE DEVELOPED.",

A CENTRAL EVENT IN THROMBOTIC DISEASES IS THE TRANSITION OF CIRCULATING, NONACTIVATED PLATELETS TO A STATEIN WHICH THEY INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER TO FORM A THROMBUS. THIS EVENT, PLATELET AGGREGATION, DEPENDS UPON A CHANGE IN PLATELET MEMBRANE GLYCOPROTEIN GPIIB-IIIA, SUCH THAT IT ACQUIRES THE CAPACITY TO SERVE AS A RECEPTOR FOR ADHESIVE PROTEINS. THE OCCUPANCY OF GPIIB-IIIA BY FIBRINOGEN LEADS TO PLATELET AGGREGATION. MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES THAT RECOGNIZE FUNCTIONAL GPIIB-IIIA, BUT NOT ITS RESTING CONFORMER, WOULD REACT SELECTIVELY WITH ACTIVATED PLATELETS. THREE STRATEGIES, ONE BASED UPON THE USE OF A PEPTIDE SEQUENCE IN GPIIB-IIIA AS AN IMMUNOGEN, WILL BE EMPLOYED TO ELICIT THE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES. WITH THREE INDEPENDENT STRATEGIES, WITH THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE BASE OF THE STRUCTURE-FUNCTION OFGPIIB-IIIA, AND WITH CORVAS, INC.'S, EXPERTISE IN MONOCLONALANTIBODY PRODUCTION, THE DEVELOPMENT OF REAGENTS WITH THE APPROPRIATE SPECIFICITY IS ANTICIPATED.

IN PHASE I, IT IS PLANNED TOCHARACTERIZE THE ABILITY OF FORMS OF TISSUE INHIBITORS OF METALLOPROTEINASE TO RETARD THE BREAKDOWN OF ARTICULAR CARTILAGE MATRIX IN ORGAN CULTURE MODELS OF OSTEOARTHRITIS. DURING NORMAL PHYSIOLOGY, THE SYNTHESIS, ASSEMBLY, AND DEGRADATION OF THE MATRIX ARE WELL-COORDINATED EVENTS. HOWEVER, IN CERTAIN PATHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS, SUCH AS OSTEOARTHRITIS, THE CATABOLIC PATHWAYS PREDOMINATE. ONE WAYTHAT TISSUES NORMALLY CONTROL EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX BREAKDOWN IS BY THE SECRETION OF SELECTIVE PROTEASE INHIBITORS CALLED TIMP'S. SEVERAL TYPES OF TIMP WILL BE ASSAYED FOR ENHANCED MATRIX PROTECTION. THE INHIBITORY PROPERTIES OF THESE TIMP FORMS WILL BE COMPARED USING TWO DIFFERENT PROTEASES THAT ARE PRESENT IN ARTICULAR CARTILAGE. THE MATRIX PROTECTIVE ACTION OF THE TIMP'S WILL BE DETERMINED IN STUDIES USING IL-1-INDUCED BOVINE CARTILAGE ORGAN CULTURE AND NATURALLY OCCURRING HUMAN OSTEOARTHRITIC CARTILAGE ORGAN CULTURE. EVIDENCE OF ENHANCED MATRIX PROTECTION WOULD FORM THE BASIS OF PHASE II IN VIVO STUDIES USING ANIMAL MODELS OF OSTEOARTHRITIS.",

IT IS BELIEVED THAT BY IMPROVING UPON THE HIGH PRESSURE FLOAT ZONE CRYSTAL GROWTH METHOD NOW USED FOR TIC CRYSTAL GROWTH, BOTH THE QUALITY AND SIZE REQUIREMENTS CAN BE MET. THE PRIMARY EFFORT IN THE PHASE I PROGRAM WILL BE TO REDUCE ALL IMPURITIES IN THE FLOAT ZONE CHAMBER, ESPECIALLY THOSE ORIGINATING FROM THE TIC FEED RODS AND THE PRESSURIZED INERT COVER GAS. IMPURITIES WITHIN THE FEED ROD CAN CAUSE DISLOCATIONS OR NUCLEATE NEW CRYSTALS, LIMITING THE SIZE OF THE SINGLE CRYSTAL BEING GROWN. THESE WILL BE REDUCED BY USING HIGH PURITY POWDERS IN THE MANUFACTURE OF THE FEED RODS. IMPURITIES IN THE PRESSURIZED INERT COVER GAS CAN CAUSE ARCING BETWEEN THE RF COIL AND THE WORKPIECE, IN ADDITION TO CONTAMINATING THE FEED ROD. THESE WILL BE REDUCED BY USING PROPRIETARY GAS PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY. A COMPUTER SIMULATION RUN WILL ALSO BE DONE IN PHASE I. THIS PHASE I PROGRAM WILL RESULT IN THE GROWTH OF HIGH PURITY 3/4 IN.

IN THIS PROJECT, STUDIES WILL BE DESIGNED TO OPTIMIZE SURFACE CHEMISTRIES FOR THE ATTACHMENT OF POLYMYXIN TO NON-PARTICLE-BASED SUPPORTS. THESE SUPPORTS ARE RIGID, HAVEEXCELLENT FLOW RATES, AND HAVE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES COMPATIBLE WITH HIGH-VOLUME APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS DETOXIFICATION OF PHARMACEUTICALS. ONCE THE ATTACHMENT CHEMISTRY IS DEFINED, THE OPTIMUM CONFIGURATION OF THE POLYMYXIN SUPPORT WILL BE DETERMINED IN COMBINATION WITH VACUUM ULTRAFILTRATION TO PROVIDE A SINGLE UNIT THAT WILL BOTH STERILIZE AND DETOXIFY IN A SINGLE STEP. IF SUCCESSFUL, THIS RESEARCH SHOULD LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PROTOTYPE DEVICE WHICH, WHEN REFINED, SHOULD FIND WIDESPREAD USES IN THE BIOTECHNOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES.

THE SHORT WAVELENGTH LIMIT OF OPERATION IS MAINLY DEPENDENT ON THE OPTICS PERFORMANCE. THE BEST KNOWN OPTICAL MATERIALSARE DEGRADED BY THE HARMONIC RADIATION PRODUCED UNAVOIDABLY DURING FEL OPERATION. THE DEVELOPMENT OF IMPROVED MATERIALSFOR THIS APPLICATION REQUIRES THE MEASUREMENT (AND MINIMIZATION) NOT JUST OF THE STATIC LOSSES, BUT OF THE SUM OF THE STATIC AND THE ABOVE DYNAMIC LOSSES. WE PROPOSE TO MIMIC THE FEL HARMONIC EFFECTS WITH A PHOTON BEAM AT A SYNCHROTRON RADIATION FACILITY, AND MEASURE THE COMBINED STATIC AND DYNAMIC LOSSES OF A RANGE OF CANDIDATE MATERIALS IN THE ULTRAVIOLET WAVELENGTH RANGE OF THE NIST FEL. WE WILL UTILIZE A STATE-OF-THE-ART VACUUM TEST CHAMBER AND RINGDOWN MEASUREMENT TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED AT DEACON RESEARCH, WHICH NEEDS ONLY MINOR MODIFICATION TO OPERATE IN THE UV. IN PHASE I, WE WILL ANALYZE THE REQUIRED EQUIPMENT MODIFICATIONS, TEST ONE OF THE APPROACHES, AND ACQUIRE AN OPTIMUM SET OF TEST SAMPLES. THE PHASE II PROGRAM WILL INSTALL THESE CHANGES INTO THE CHAMBER AND MEASURE THE COMBINED STATIC-DYNAMIC LOSSES ACROSS THE EXPECTED NIST OPERATING RANGE. THIS INFORMATION WILL THEN BE FOLDED INTO A PROGRAM TO OPTIMIZE THE OPTICS TECHNOLOGY.",

BECAUSE OF ITS NEWNESS, LITTLE SYSTEMS APPLICATION WORK HAS BEEN PERFORMED TO-DATE. THE AREAS OF GREATEST POTENTIAL ARE IN RADAR, SONAR, AND PARTICULARLY, ELECTRONIC WARFARE (EW). IN ORDER TO EXPLOIT THIS DEVICE FULLY, SYSTEM DESIGN WORK MUST BE UNDERTAKEN TO DEVELOP CIRCUITS AND SUBSYSTEMS THAT CAN BE REALIZED EVENTUALLY IN A FULLY MONOLITHIC FORM. IT IS PROPOSED THAT THE ACT DEVICE BE ANALYZEDFROM A EW SYSTEMS APPLICATION VIEWPOINT AND ALL PERTINENT CHARACTERISTICS ADDRESSED SO THAT SEVERAL KEY BUILDING BLOCK DESIGNS CAN BE EVOLVED, AIMED AT A PHASE II FABRICATION EFFORT. MEMORY AND FILTERBANK APPLICATIONS ARE CHOSEN AS TWO OF THE MOST POTENTIALLY REWARDING AREAS OF EXPLOITATION. KNOWLEDGE GAINED ON PREVIOUS ACT EFFORTS WILL BE BROUGHT TO BEAR AND PAST CONTACT WITH EDI, THE FOREMOST ACT DEVELOPMENT LABORATORY, WILL ASSIST IN GAINING ACCESS TO THE CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART IN ACT DEVELOPMENT. PRELIMINARY DESIGNS DEVELOPED FOR PAST APPLICATION PROVIDE A STARTING POINT FOR THE PROPOSED EFFORT, SAVING TIME AND YIELDING AN EXCELLENT JUMPING-OFF POINT FOR A PHASE II FOLLOW-ON.",

MONOCRYSTALLINE TIC CAN BE GROWN BY CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION ON A LATTICE-MATCHED SUBSTRATE. DIAMOND MATERIALS INSTITUTE INC (DMI) PLANS TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL IN TWO PHASES. IN PHASE I, DMI PLANS TO DEMONSTRATE A NOVEL, STEP PROCESS FOR HETEROEPITAXIAL GROWTH OF TIC BY CVD. THE SUBSTRATE WILL BE A FREE-STANDING B-SIC SINGLE CRYSTAL HETEROEPITAXIALLY GROWN ON SI. DMI PROPOSES A NOVEL PROCESS TO GETTER CRYSTALLINE DEFECTS FROM THE B-SIC SURFACE BEFORE TIC DEPOSITION. REMOVAL OF CRYSTALLINE DEFECTS FROM THE SURFACE OF THE B-SIC SUBSTRATE SHOULD PREVENT NUCLEATION OF DEFECTS IN THE TIC. PHASE II WILL SCALE-UP THE PROCESS TO CREATE DEFECT-FREE, TIC MONOCRYSTALS AT LEAST 100 MM IN DIAMETER. PHASE II WILL INCLUDE HETEROEPITAXIAL GROWTH OF SEMICONDUCTOR-GRADE B-SIC ON THE MONOCRYSTALLINE TIC AND THE FABRICATION OF SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES IN THE B-SIC.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME (AIDS) IS A CLINICAL SYNDROME RESULTING FROM THE INTERACTION OF A WIDE VARIETY OFPATHOGENS WITH THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. THE CLASSIC PROGRESSION IS FROM HIV EXPOSURE TO SEROCONVERSION TO AIDS-RELATED COMPLEX (ARC) TO AIDS. ACCURATE DIAGNOSIS OF PATHOGENS OTHER THAN HIV IS NECESSARY TO DETERMINE THE PROGRESSION OF DISEASE AND APPROPRIATE THERAPY. ALSO, EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT VIRAL INTERACTION ACCELERATES THE PROGRESSION FROM ARC TO AIDS AND DEATH. IF SO, RAPID DIAGNOSIS OF THESE VIRUSES IS OF EXTREME IMPORTANCE. DNA PROBES DIRECTLY LINKED TO ENZYMES CAN BE QUICKLY, EASILY, AND EFFECTIVELY USED TO DIAGNOSE AND QUANTIFY THE PRESENCE OF THESE VIRAL PATHOGENS, REGARDLESS OF THE STATUS OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSE, ANTIGEN MASKING, OR THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION. IN PHASE I, DIRECTLY LABELED DNA PROBES WILL BE USED IN RAPID IN SITU HYBRIDIZATIONS TO DETECT THE PRESENCE OF VIRUSES IN AIDS-ASSOCIATED DISORDERS, SUCH AS HAIRY LEUKOPLAKIA, KAPOSI'S SARCOMA, OTHER SKIN DISEASES, AND PNEUMONIA. THE QUANTITY AND HISTOLOGIC LOCATION OF THESE VIRUSES WILL BE INVESTIGATED. PHASE II WILL APPLY THESE FINDINGS BY STUDYING THE PATHOGENESIS OF VARIOUS AIDS-ASSOCIATED DISORDERS AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF HERPES VIRUSES ON HIV REPLICATION TO DETERMINE IF VARIOUS ANTIVIRALTHERAPIES DECREASE VIRAL REPLICATION.",

DESPITE ITS IMPORTANCE, RELATIVELY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT PROPER PROCEDURES FOR KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING. MOST OF WHAT IS PUBLISHED ARE RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON INDIVIDUAL CASE STUDIES AND OTHER ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE, AND NOT ON SYSTEMATIC INVESTIGATION. IN THIS RESEARCH, THE RESEARCHERS EXPLORE THE EXTENT TO WHICH COGNITIVE BIASES HAVE AN IMPACT ON KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING, PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF UNCERTAINTY HANDLING. SPECIFICALLY, THEY WILL DEMONSTRATE THAT NOT ONLY ARE EXPERTS SUBJECT TO BIASES WHILE SOLVING PROBLEMS, BUT THAT THEY ARE ALSO LIKELY TO EXHIBIT \"REPORTING BIASES\" WHEN THEYARTICULATE THE KNOWLEDGE THEY USE TO SOLVE PROBLEMS. IN ADDITION, KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERS WILL BE SHOWN TO BE SUBJECT TOTHE SAME BIASES AS DOMAIN EXPERTS AND THEREFORE UNLIKELY TO CATCH BIASES IN KNOWLEDGE ELICITED FROM DOMAIN EXPERTS.

THESE TRANSDUCERS ARE EXPECTED TO RESOLVE THE TIMING OF THE REACTION OF METAL ADDATIVES IN THE EXPLOSIVES, THUS PROVIDING INFORMATION ON PERFORMANCE. THE APPROACH TO DEVELOPING THE TRANSDUCERS IS TO USE THIN FILM SENSORS INCORPORATED INTO RUGGED TRANSDUCER ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE CAPABLE OF SURVIVING AN INTENSE INITIAL SHOCK WAVE. THIS WILL PERMIT LATER TIME TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE MEASUREMENTS. THIN FILM SHOCK PRESSURE SENSORS IS A TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS WELL DEVELOPED AND PROVEN. THIN FILM PIEZORESISTIVE (CARBON) AND PIEZOELECTRIC (PVF2 AND VF2/VF3) SENSORS WILL BE USED FOR THE PRESSURE MEASUREMENTS. THIN FILM THERMORESISTIVE ELEMENTS (TANTALUM OR MOLYBDENUM ON A CERAMIC SUBSTRATE) WILL BE DEVELOPED AND USED FOR THE TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENTS. DEVELOPMENT OF THESE TRANSDUCERS, CAPABLE OF PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENTS WELL BEYOND THOSE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE, WILL EXTEND THE STATE OF THE ART IN HIGH PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE TECHNOLOGY.

PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTS DEMONSTRATED THAT THIS TECHNIQUE, WHICH IS ALSO QUANTITATIVE, WORKS WITH OLIGO-PROBES AND OLIGO-TARGET DNA USING PERMEATION CHROMATOGRAPHY. IT MUST BE DEMONSTRATED THAT IT WILL WORK WITH LARGE, MULTISPECIES NUCLEIC ACID TARGETS. THE NEW TECHNIQUE (AUTOSAMPLER) WOULD ALLOW FOR MULTIPLE EXPERIMENTS, ENABLING MULTIPLE STRINGENCY TESTS PER UNIT TIME THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE IMPOSSIBLE WITH THE CONVENTIONAL METHOD. THE SYNTHETIC OLIGO-PROBES ARE NONRADIOACTIVE AND HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF BETTER HYBRIDIZATION DISCRIMINATION OVER CONVENTIONAL ONES.

WE PROPOSE A RECEPTOR-BASED BIOSENSOR COUPLED WITH SURFACE ENHANCED RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY (SERS) FOR A DIRECT SPECTROSCOPIC APPROACH TO BIOSENSING. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PHASE I PROGRAM IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF DETECTING SPECIFIC RECEPTOR-LIGAND (R-L) BINDING REACTIONS UTILIZING ENHANCED RAMAN TECHNIQUES. MODEL R-L BINDING SYSTEMS FOR STUDY WILL INCLUDE KNOWN AFFINITY SYSTEMS SUCH AS ANTIBODY-ANTIGEN AND LECTIN-CARBOHYDRATE COMBINATIONS. A SIX-MONTH PROGRAM OF RESEARCH WILL INVESTIGATE THE SERS SPECTRA OF MODEL RECEPTORS, LIGANDS AND R-L COMPLEXES. RECEPTORS MOLECULES WILL BE ABSORBED TO A SURFACE WHICH GIVES ENHANCED RAMAN ACTIVITY, AND THE RAMAN SPECTRUM RECORDED. THE LIGAND WILL THEN BE ADDED AND THE RAMAN SPECTRUM RECORDED AGAIN TO THE RECEPTORLIGAND COMPLEX. THE CHANGE IN SERS SIGNAL WOULD FORM THE BASIS FOR A NEW TYPE OF SENSOR IN QHICH THE R-L BINDING REACTION COULD BE OBSERVED IN REAL TIME AND RELATED TO THE CONCENTRATION OF LIGAND.",

THIS NEW TECHNIQUE IS RAPID, 3 TO 6 ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE MORESENSITIVE THAN EXISTING ASSAYS, AND DOES NOT RELY ON THE USEOF RADIOISOTOPES. THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY, DESIGNATED ENZYME LUMINESCENCE ASSAY (ELA), UTILIZES THE REMARKABLE SENSITIVITY OF THE RECOMBINANT, BIOLUMINESCENT PROTEIN, AEQUORIN, AND THE HIGH AFFINITY INTERACTIONS OF STREPTAVIDIN AND BIOTIN. ELA HAS BEEN USED TO DETERMINE THE ACTIVITY OF UDPGAL:BETA-D-GLCNAC(BETA1,4) GALACTOSYLTRANSFERASE. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THESE STUDIES ARE: (1) TO DEVELOP ELA'S FOR ADDITIONAL GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASES, INCLUDING UDPGAL:GALBETA1,4GLC(NAC)(ALPHA1,3)GALACTOSYLTRANSFERASE AND CMPNEUAC:GALBETA1,3(4)GLCNAC(ALPHA2,3)SIALYLTRANSFERASE;AND (2) TO ADAPT ELA'S TO A MICROTITER PLATE ASSAY.

A SOLID MODELER FACILITATES COMPLETE REPRESENTATION OF ROBOT ENVIRONMENT; VISIBILITY/FREE-SPACE GRAPHS CORRESPONDS TO WHAT THE ROBOT 'KNOWS'. THE SEPARATION OF A PRIORI KNOWN ENVIRONMENT FROM THE ROBOT'S ACCUMULATING KNOWLEDGE ENTAILS INDEPENDENT DEVELOPMENT AND USAGE OF OBJECT MODELS AND EXPLORATION ALGORITHMS. OBJECTS BASED ON PROVEN SOLID GEOMETRIC MODELING COMMON IN MECHANICAL CAD SYSTEMS, CAN REPRESENT MOST OBSTACLES OF DESIRED SHAPES AND COMPLEXITY. A COMMON TYPE OF SOLID MODEL USES SUCH PRIMITIVE SOLIDS AS BLOCKS, CYLINDER, CONES, AND SPHERES AND FORM COMPOSITE OBJECTS BY PERFORMING BOOLEAN OPERATIONS (INTERSECTION, UNION, AND DIFFERENCE) ON THEM. ANOTHER COMMON REPRESENTATION SCHEME IS BASED ON BOUNDARY REPRESENTATION OF ALL OBJECT SURFACES. OBJECTS WITH LINEAR AND QUADRIC SURFACES ARE EASILY REPRESENTED. THESE THUS ENCOMPASS ALL POLYHEDRA AND POLYGONS IN A TWO-DIMENSIONAL WORLD. VISIBILITY OF OBSTACLE FEATURES AND THE FREE SPACE BETWEEN OBSTACLES REPRESENT THE ROBOT'S KNOWS THROUGH USE OF ITS SENSORS AND SUITABLE EXPLORATION PROCESSES.

THE SOI WAFER WILL ELIMINATE LATCH-UP EFFECTS, REDUCE NEUTRON-CAPTURE VOLUME AND PROVIDE ELECTRICAL ISOLATION FOR VJFET MICROCIRCUIT FABRICATION. THE RESULTANT VJFET IS HIGHLY DESIRABLE FOR FABRICATING VERY HIGH-SPEED (20 GIGAHZ) MICROCIRCUITS THAT MUST SURVIVE HIGH RADIATION (NATURAL OR INDUCED) ENVIRONMENTS.

THE PRESENT FUEL CELL-ELECTROLYZER SYSTEM USES 48 PERCENT HBR WITH NAFION AS A SOLID POLYMER ELECTROLYTE MEMBRANE. THE INTRINSIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS NAFION BASED SYSTEM ARE: (1) A CONSTANTLY CHANGING NERNST POTENTIALASSOCIATED WITH CHANGING HBR CONCENTRATIONS AND (2) THE NEEDFOR AN INORDINATE AMOUNT OF WATER WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY INERTFOR POWER APPLICATION. THE RESEARCHERS PROPOSE TO OVERCOME THESE DISADVANTAGES BY EMPLOYING ANION SELECTIVE MEMBRANES. TWO SPECIFIC PROBLEMS TO BE ADDRESSED ARE (1) IDENTIFICATIONOF A STABLE BROMIDE ION CONDUCTING MEMBRANE AND (2) THE STABILITY OF THE CATALYST SYSTEM. PRELIMINARY RESULTS IN THIS LABORATORY SHOW THAT FLUOROPOLYMER BASED MEMBRANES WEREUNATTACKED BY PURE BROMINE AND AQUEOUS SOLUTION OF BROMINE DURING ONE DAY AND EIGHT WEEK EXPOSURES, RESPECTIVELY. IT WAS ALSO CONFIRMED THAT THIS MEMBRANE WAS IMPERVIOUS TO GASEOUS HYDROGEN AND BROMINE VAPORS AT 60 DEGREES CENTIGRADE. A CELL WITH CARBON BLACK AT THE BROMINE ELECTRODE AND PLATINUM BASED CATALYST AT THE HYDROGEN ELECTRODE GAVE EXCELLENT OPEN CIRCUIT POTENTIAL. ABILITY TO OPERATE ON ANHYDROUS, GASEOUS, AND LIQUID BROMINE WITH RELATIVELY LOW MEMBRANE RESISTANCE WAS OBSERVED IN SHORT TIME TESTS. IN THE PROPOSED RESEARCH, ELECTROCHEM, INC., WILL ESTABLISH A TECHNOLOGICAL BASE FOR THE DESIGN OF EFFICIENT, RELIABLE, AND LONG LIVED SECONDARY BATTERIES. SPECIFICALLY, THEY WILL INVESTIGATE LONG TERM STABILITY OF MEMBRANE AND CATALYST SYSTEMS, IDENTIFY CRITICAL NEEDS IN THE MEMBRANE AND CATALYSIS RESEARCH, AND ESTABLISH A STRONG BASIS FOR PHASE II RESEARCH. FURTHERMORE, THIS UNIQUE RESEARCH IS EXPECTED TO STIMULATE DEVELOPMENT IN MEMBRANE TECHNOLOGY AND CHEMICAL AND THERMODYNAMIC SCIENCES.",

NEODYMIUM-IRON-BORON PERMANENT MAGNETS ELIMINATE THE REQUIREMENT FOR HIGH POWER ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONS TO THE MOVING LAUNCHING DEVICE. MAGNETIC SUSPENSION TECHNOLOGY USING PERMANENT MAGNETS WILL PREVENT THEDEVICE FROM RATTLING DOWN THE LAUNCH TUBE. A PERMANENT MAGNET POTENTIAL WELL LATCH CAN SECURE THE DEVICE UNTIL THE MAGNETS ARE OVERWHELMED BY DRIVEN WINDINGS. THIS WILL ELIMINATE THE REQUIREMENT FOR RELEASING A MECHANICAL LATCH WHICH COULD CREATE NOISE. WITH THESE COMBINED TECHNOLOGIES A UNIQUELY QUIET LAUNCHER CAN BE REALIZED. MOTOR LAMINATIONS, WINDING AXIS AND PITCH AXIS ARE ALL SIMILAR IN CONCEPT TO A CONVENTIONAL SYNCHRONOUS MOTOR BUT ARE ROTATED TO PROVIDE LINEAR MOTION. THE PERFORMANCE DEMANDED OF THIS SYSTEM IN THIS APPLICATION IS NOT GREATER THAN THAT REALIZED BY CONVENTIONAL ROTATING MOTORS, NOR IS IT GREATER THAN COMMERCIAL LINEAR MOTORS. FOR THAT REASON THE PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS SEEMS QUITE HIGH.",

THE SYSTEM USES AN ELECTROSTATIC FIELD ON THE DEHYDROGENATION SIDE TO CONTROL HYDROCARBON ADSORPTION AND THE CHEMICAL DEHYDROGENATION RATE OF METHANOL OR FORMIC ACIDTO ATOMIC HYDROGEN AND CARBON DIOXIDE. THIS APPROACH TO DIRECT HYDROCARBON OXIDATION HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF GREAT SIMPLICITY SINCE THERE IS NO NEED FOR A HIGH TEMPERATURE CATALYTIC REFORMER AND REFORMER GAS PURIFICATION EQUIPMENT, PRESENTLY REQUIRED FOR INDIRECT HYDROCARBON OXIDATION FUEL CELLS. FURTHERMORE, THE SYSTEM ONLY TRANSPORTS ATOMIC HYDROGEN. HENCE IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR CARBON OXIDES OR OTHER IMPURITIES TO BUILD-UP OR PRECIPITATE IN THE FUEL CELL SIDE ELECTROLYTE. IF THIS APPROACH IS SUCCESSFUL, IT COULD HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON FUEL CELL POWERED AUTOMOBILES AND OTHER PORTABLE POWER APPLICATIONS.",

WHILE THERE IS NOT YET AN ESTABLISHED FUNDING SOURCE TO UNDERWRITE SECONDARY PREVENTION OF PROGRESSIVE OCCUPATIONAL DISABILITY, POTENTIAL FUNDING MECHANISMS APPEAR TO BE INCREASINGLY AVAILABLE. IF A PREVENTION MECHANISM CAN PROVIDE DEMONSTRABLE RESULTS WITH A POPULATION THAT IS AT RISK OF PROGRESSIVE OCCUPATIONAL DISABILITY THAT WILL REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL EXPENDITURE FOR REHABILITATION, IT IS MORE LIKELY THAT FUNDING WILL BE UNDERTAKEN BY EMPLOYERS AND/OR INSURANCE CARRIERS. PREVENTION OF DISABILITY IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO THE OLDER WORKER. CONTINUATION OF A CAREER IN OLD AGE ENABLES THE WORKER TO MAINTAIN INDEPENDENCE THROUGH THE REDUCTION OFECONOMIC DEPENDENCY.

THESE ENGINES ARE PREDOMINANTLY TWO CYCLE AND PRODUCE AN EXHAUST HAVING A HIGH RATIO OF OXYGEN (O2) TO NITRIC OXIDE (NO). THUS, A SELECTIVE NO REDUCTION TECHNIQUE IS NEEDED WHICH CONVERTS THE NO TO NITROGEN (N2) WITHOUT AFFECTING THE MUCH LARGER AMOUNT OF O2 PRESENT. THE ONLY AVAILABLE REDUCING AGENT, HOWEVER, IS METHANE AND THERE HAS BEEN NO KNOWN METHOD BY WHICH METHANE COULD BE MADE TO REDUCE NO SELECTIVELY. A NEWLY DISCOVERED CHEMICAL REACTION IS DESCRIBED. IN THIS REACTION A PROPRIETARY SOLID UNDERGOES A RAPID REVERSIBLE REACTION WITH NO UNDER OXIDIZING CONDITIONS. THE POSITION OF THIS EQUILIBRIUM IS SENSITIVE TO THE CONCENTRATION OF O2 AND UNDER OXIDIZING CONDITIONS ESSENTIALLY QUANTITATIVE NO REMOVAL CAN BE ACHIEVED BY PASSING AN EXHAUST GAS CONTAINING NO THROUGH THE PROPRIETARY SOLID AT A HIGH SPACE VELOCITY. UNDER REDUCING CONDITIONS, HOWEVER, THE EQUILIBRIUM SHIFTS. A SOLID WHICH IS SATURATED WITH NO MAY BE REJUVENATED, AND THE NO REDUCED TO N2. ORDINARILY REDUCING AGENTS SUCH AS METHANE, HYDROGEN, AND CARBON MONOXIDE ARE ONLY CAPABLE OF REDUCING NO IN A NONSELECTIVE MANNER. IF ONE OF THEM IS USED TO REDUCE NO IN A GAS MIXTURE, IT IS NECESSARY TO SUPPLY ENOUGH REAGENT TO REDUCE ALL THE OXIDIZING SPECIES. THUS BY USING THE SOLID TO TRANSFER NO FROM THE OXIDIZING EXHAUST GAS INTO A REDUCING ENVIRONMENT, THE SOLID ENABLES METHANE TO SELECTIVELY REDUCE NO. A RESEARCH PROGRAM IS DESCRIBED FOR A LABORATORY SCALE DEMONSTRATION OF THE FEASIBILITY OF USING THIS NEW REACTION TO CONTROL THE NOX EMISSIONS OF STATIONARY GAS ENGINES.",

THE PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT, WHEN APPLIED TO A RECIPROCATING ENGINE COGENERATION SYSTEM, INCREASES THE USEFUL THERMAL OUTPUT BY ABOUT 50% WITHOUT DECREASING THE ELECTRICAL OUPUT. IT BOOSTS THE OVERALL EFFICIENCY OF RECIPROCATING ENGINE COGENERATION SYSTEMS BY ABOUT 20%. IN MANY COGENERATION APPLICATIONS (E.G., HOSPITALS), HEAT MUST BE SUPPLIED AT ABOVE 260 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT IN ORDER TO BE USEFUL. IN THESE APPLICATIONS, ONLY THE EXHAUST HEAT OF A RECIPROCATING ENGINE COGENERATOR IS RECOVERED, WHILE THE HEAT IN THE ENGINE COOLING WATER IS DISCARDED. THE METHOD TO BE EMPLOYED IN THIS PROJECT USES AN ABSORPTION HEAT PUMP TO RAISE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE HEAT IN THE COOLING WATER TOA USEFUL LEVEL. THE HEAT PUMP IS DRIVEN BY THE ENGINE'S EXHAUST HEAT. THE NET RESULT IS THAT THE SYSTEM DELIVERS ABOUT 50% MORE STEAM AT 260 DEGREES TO 320 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT THAN WOULD OTHERWISE BE POSSIBLE. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT INCREASING FUEL CONSUMPTION OR DECREASING THE SYSTEM'S ELECTRICAL OUTPUT. THE IMPROVEMENT IS BASED ON A NEW ABSORPTION CYCLE WORKING FLUID. THIS FLUID, CALLED ALKITRATE, HAS ALREADY ACHIEVED THE HIGH TEMPERATURES (500 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT) REQUIRED FOR THIS APPLICATION IN A LABORATORY HEAT PUMP. PHASE I RELATES TO THE EFFICIENT INTERFACE OF THE ENGINE WITH THE HEAT PUMP. A NOVEL, PATENTED, DOUBLY OPEN ABSORPTION CYCLE WILL BE INVESTIGATED.",

IN THIS PROJECT, CONDUCTIVE LOW COST STAINLESS STEELS COATED WITH LITHIUM FERRITE (LIFEO2) WILL BE DEVELOPED TO DECREASE CORROSION AND ELECTROLYTE CREEPAGE LOSS AND TO SPEED THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF MCFC TECHNOLOGY. THE LITHIUM FERRITE LAYER WILL BE PROVIDED BY PRE-OXIDATION OF SELECTED STAINLESS STEELS IN THE PRESENCE OF MOLTEN CARBONATE. TO INCREASE SURFACE FE CONCENTRATION AND ENSURE A COMPACT, CONTINUOUS LIFEO2 LAYER, A PLATED FE THIN LAYER MAY BE APPLIED BEFORE PRE- OXIDATION. A NICKEL OR COPPER THIN LAYER MAY ALSO BE APPLIED UNDERNEATH SUCH AN FE LAYER TO IMPROVE LIFEO2 CONDUCTIVITY THROUGH DOPING. THE COMPACT LIFEO2 SHOULD PREVENT CARBONATE ATTACK ON A CR2O3 LAYER. THAT PREVENTS SUBSTRATE CATION DIFFUSION AND REDUCES OVER-ALL CORROSION ATTACK. BECAUSE CR2O3 DISSOLUTION IN CARBONATE IS EXPECTED TO BE LESS WITH SUCH A COATING, A LOW ELECTROLYTE LOSS ALSO IS EXPECTED.",

IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, LASERS, MILLIMETER WAVES AND VARIOUS FORMS OF PROPAGATION MODULATION AND SIGNAL ENCRYPTION HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS. NONE HAVE BEEN 100% SUCCESSFUL. EARLY WORK WITH A NEUTRON PARTICLE BEAM, HOWEVER, INDICATES THAT THERE MAY BE A SINGLE SOLUTION TO FULFILLING THOSE CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS. THE SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM (SPOCS), USES A PULSE STREAM OF NEUTRONS FROM A NEUTRON GENERATOR AS A SECURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATIONS. THE TECHNIQUE APPLIES TO USES ON THE EARTH'S SURFACE AS WELL AS IN SPACE. THE NEUTRON WAS CHOSEN AS THE MEDIUM WITH WHICH TO TRANSMIT INFORMATION BECAUSE IT IS A NONCOMBINING NEUTRAL PARTICLE, AND AS SUCH, IS UNAFFECTED BY MAGNETIC FIELDS WHICH OCCUR DUE TO THE EARTH'S INFLUENCE, OR MAGNETIC FIELDS WHICH ARE GENERATED IN SPACE. IT IS ALSO UNAFFECTED BY WEATHER, SMOKE, BLAST, EMP EFFECTS, OR ELECTRONIC COUNTERMEASURES.",

DURING PHASE I, RESEARCH WILL: (1) TEST THE ANTIVIRAL EFFICACY, IN TISSUE CULTURE, OFANTISENSE OLIGONUCLEOTIDES COMPLEMENTARY TO SPECIFIC REGIONSOF THE MHV GENOME; AND (2) DEVELOP PLASMID CONSTRUCTS CONTAINING SIMILAR SEQUENCES AND PRODUCE TRANSFORMANTS THAT EXPRESS THOSE SEQUENCES AS ANTISENSE RNA'S. THESE TRANSFORMANTS WILL THEN BE TESTED FOR THEIR SUSCEPTIBILITY AND RESISTANCE TO INFECTION BY MHV. THE FINDINGS OF THESE STUDIES WILL BE APPLIED IN PHASE II TO THE DEVELOPMENTOF THE PROPER STRATEGY FOR DEVELOPING HEPATITIS-RESISTANT STRAINS OF MICE. THIS WORK HAS MAJOR SIGNIFICANCE IN THREE AREAS. FIRST, BECAUSE MOUSE HEPATITIS VIRUS IS A COMMON CONTAGION IN MOUSECOLONIES, THE DEVELOPMENT OF RESISTANT STRAINS MAY HELP TO REDUCE COLONY LOSS AND COLONY MAINTENANCE COSTS. SECOND, THE RESULTS WILL ALSO HELP DEFINE THE MECHANISM OF ACTION OF THE TWO TYPES OF ANTIVIRAL ANTISENSE THERAPIES. THIS STUDY WILL REPRESENT THE FIRST COMPARISON OF THESE ANTIVIRALSTRATEGIES ON A SINGLE SYSTEM. THIRD, SHOULD THESE EFFORTS BE SUCCESSFUL IN PRODUCING MHV-RESISTANT MICE, SIMILAR PROCEDURES FOR CONTROL OF CORONAVIRUS INFECTION IN OTHER ANIMALS (CATTLE, PIGS, AND POULTRY) CAN BE EXPLORED.",

HOWEVER, WHEN SUCH MEASURES ARE EMPLOYED, THEY ARE GENERALLY INSENSITIVE TO ALL BUT THE MOST POWERFUL STRESSOR EFFECTS. ONE OF THE CONTRIBUTING PROBLEMS TO THIS ISSUE IS THE LACK OF RELIABILITY. INSUFFICIENT ATTENTION TO RELIABILITY CAN LEAD TO REDUCTION OF STATISTICAL POWER, HIGHER SAMPLE SIZE REQUIREMENTS, HIGHER COST, AND WHEN HAZARD IS INVOLVED, OTHER PROBLEMS. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A QUANTITATIVE DEFINITION OF SOLDIER PERFORMANCE DEGRADATION DUE TO EXPOSURE TO IRRITANT GASES BY TWO LINKING APPROACHES: SURROGATE MEASURES AND DOSE EQUIVALENCE. SURROGATE MEASURES ARE RELATED TO, OR PREDICTIVE OF, A CONSTRUCT OF INTEREST BUT ARE NOT DIRECT MEASURES. DOSE EQUIVALENCE REFERS TO AN EXPERIMENTAL METHOD WHERE PERFORMANCE DEFICITS PRODUCED WITH A CONTROLLED (AND BENIGN) INDEXING AGENT AND IRRITANT GASES ARE THEN CALIBRATED AGAINST THE AGENT. HUMAN AND ANIMAL DATA WILL BE OBTAINED FROM THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE TO THE EXTENT THEY ARE AVAILABLE FOR MOTOR AND REACTION TIME PERFORMANCES. TO QUANTIFY THE HUMAN MENTAL ACUITY FUNCTIONS WHICH ARE RELATED TO MILITARY JOBS, A PORTABLE MICROCOMPUTER MENU OF TESTS WILL BE EMPLOYED.

THE DETECTION PRINCIPAL IS BASED ONT HE FACT THAT THE ABSORED INFRARED RADIATION REDUCES THE ENERGY GAP OF THE SUPERCONDUCTOR, MODIFYING THE CURRENT--VOLTAGE CHARACTERISTICS OF JOSEPHSON JUNCTION WHICH CAN SERVE AS A SUEFUL DETECTOR OUTPUT. RECENTLY, IN A PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENT, WE HAVE OBSERVED FOR THE FIRST TIME, NOT ONLY A SLOW BOLOMETRIC RESPONSE BUT ALSO A FAST NON-THERMAL QUNATUM RESPONSE DUE TO COOPER PAIR BREAKING AND QUASI-PARTICLES GENERATION IN YBACUO FILM SUBJECTED TO PULSED 532 NM LASER. IN THE PRESENT WORK, PRECISELY CONTROLLED THIN FILM OF BI-CA-SR-CU-O WILL BE DEPOSITED ON A SUITABLE SUBSTRATE BY PLASMA ASSISTED LASER DEPOSITION USING 265 NM UV LASER AT 10 HZ. SUBSEQUENT TO DEPOSITION, SUPERCONDUCTING WEAK LINK SSS TYPE JOSEPHSON JUNCTION WILL BE FABRICATED BY PATTERNING THESE FILMS WITH 532 NM VISIBLE LASER AT 1 KHZ. FOR DETECTION, INFRARED RADIATION FROM CO2 LASER AT 10.6 MICRON WILL BE MODULATED AND GUIDED THROUGH AN OPTICAL FIBER TO THE DETECTOR. IN THE PHASE I, NON-EQUILIBRIUM (QUANTUM) RESPONSE OF THE DETECTOR AT 10.6 MICRON AND THE TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF THE RESPONSE WILL BE STUDIED. THE RESPONSIVITY OF THE DETECTOR IS ESTIMATED TO BE \\ 10(4) V/W, WHICH IS SEVERAL ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE HIGHER THAN PRESENTLY AVAILABLE QUANTUM DETECTORS. IN PHASE II, WAVELENGTH DEPENDENCE OF THE RESPONSE IN THE 10-50 MICRON REGION, HIGH FREQUENCY RESPONSE, AND THE TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF THE RESPONSIVE TIME WILL BE INVESTIGATED.",

THE DISCOVERY OF BCSCO MATERIAL IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE NO LONGER NEED ANY RARE EARTH ELEMENT. THE DETECTION PRINCIPLEIS BASED ON THE FACT THAT INCIDENT FAR INFRARED RADIATION PRODUCES A VOLTAGE SHIFT ACROSS A WEAK-LINK TYPE SIS JOSEPHSON JUNCTION, WHICH CAN SERVE AS A USEFUL DETECTOR OUTPUT.

        "abstract": "Abstract         RINSE WATER AND OTHER AQUEOUS WASTES FROM METAL FINISHING OPERATIONS PRESENT A DISPOSAL PROBLEM BECAUSE OF THEIR HEAVY METAL AND AGGRESSIVE CHEMICAL CONTENT. GENERALLY, THESE WASTES ARE TREATED CHEMICALLY TO PRECIPITATE THE METALIONS AS OXIDES OR HYDROXIDES. THIS TREATMENT IS COSTLY BECAUSE IT INVOLVES THE ADDITION OF CHEMICALS, DISPOSAL OF SLUDGE WITH LOSS OF VALUABLE METALS, AND LOSS OF THE HIGH PURITY WATER REQUIRED FOR RINSING OPERATIONS. FREEZE CONCENTRATION PROCESSES HAVE DEMONSTRATED POTENTIAL FOR RECOVERING PURE WATER FOR RECYCLE TO THE RINSING OPERATION WHILE PRODUCING A CONCENTRATED STREAM SUITABLE FOR REUSE IN PLATING BATHS. CONCENTRATION BY EVAPORATION IS COSTLY DUE TO THE CORROSIVITY OF THE SOLUTIONS AT HIGH TEMPERATURE. MEMBRANE PROCESSES MAY NOT BE APPLICABLE WHEN OXIDIZING CHEMICALS ARE PRESENT. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT DATA AVAILABLE FOR THE DESIGN OF FREEZING PROCESSES FOR THE PRODUCTION OF PURE WATER FROM SEA AND BRACKISH WATERS. THE OBJECT OF THIS INVESTIGATION IS TO OBTAIN THE DESIGN DATA NECESSARY TO OPTIMIZE FREEZE CONCENTRATION OF WASTE STREAMS FROM METAL FINISHING OPERATIONS. A BENCH SCALE PLANT WILL BE ASSEMBLED TO PROCESS SIMULATED RINSE WATER FROM CHROME, NICKEL, COPPER, AND CADMIUM PLATING OPERATIONS. OPERATING DATA WILL BE OBTAINED AS A FUNCTION OF SOLUTION CONCENTRATION. THE BENCH SCALE PLANT WILL BE OPERATED AT FREEZING TEMPERATURES DOWN TO 22 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. BASED ON SEAWATER DATA, THIS WILL OCCUR AT A CONCENTRATION OF 10% TDS, REPRESENTING ABOUT 98% RECOVERY OF PURE WATER AND REDUCTION OF THE WASTE VOLUME TO 2% OF THE ORIGINAL WASTE STREAM. THE DATA IS EXPECTED TO VERIFY EXSTAR'S DESIGN CONCEPT FOR A LINE OF ECONOMICAL PACKAGED WASTE CONCENTRATION PLANTS RANGING IN SIZE FROM 1,000 TO 20,000 GALLONS PER DAY (GPD. IN PHASE II, A TRANSPORTABLE 5,000 GPD PLANT IS PLANNED FOR DEMONSTRATION ON ACTUAL WASTE STREAMS.

THE CONTINUOUS WATER MONITORING SYSTEM WILL BE COMPOSED OF A QUADRUPOLE MASS SPECTROMETER AND SEMI-PERMEABLE MEMBRANE INTERFACE. THIS INSTRUMENT WILL ENABLE US TO ANALYZE WATER DIRECTLY WITHOUT ANY SAMPLE PREPARATION. THE CHEMICAL IMPURITIES IN THE WATER WILL PERMEATE THROUGH THE SEMIPERMEABLE MEMBRANE AND BE IONIZED BY AN APPROPRIATE IONIZATION TECHNIQUE BEFORE BEING ANALYZED BY THE QUADRUPOLE MASS SPECTROMETER. THE DETECTION LIMIT OF THIS INSTRUMENT IS EXPECTED TO BE AS LOW AS 100 PARTS PER BILLION WITH A RESPONSE TIME OF LESS THAN ONE MINUTE. WE ENVISAGE THAT THIS SYSTEM WILL BE APPLICABLE NOT ONLY TO THE WATER MONITORING APPLICATION, BUT ALSO TO MEASUREMENT PROBLEMS THAT REQUIRE LOW LEVEL CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF LIQUID SAMPLES IN REAL TIME, SUCH AS FERMENTATION PROCESSES.",

FRUITFUL IN MANY SCIENTIFIC FIELDS AND PROMISING IN CLINICAL TRIALS OF COMBINATION IMMUNOTHERAPY, THEY ARE UNFORTUNATELY ONE OF THE MOST LABORIOUS BIOLOGICAL REAGENTS TO CONSTRUCT. IN THE COURSE OF TRACING THE ORIGINS OF B-CELL MALIGNANCIES,IT WAS FOUND THAT MONOCLONAL ANTI-ID ANTIBODIES REACT WITH VARYING PROPORTIONS (<0.1 TO 10 PERCENT) OF NORMAL HUMAN B-LINEAGE CELLS. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, FERLYN BIOMEDICAL WILL RAISE ANTI-ID ANTIBODIES AND SELECT FOR ANTIBODIES CROSS-REACTIVE TO A HIGH PROPORTION OF HUMAN PLASMA CELLS AND MONOCLONAL IMMUNOGLOBULINS. SELECTED ANTIBODIES WILL BE TESTED FOR PREFERENTIAL REACTIVITY TO ID(+) ANTIBODIES OF A PARTICULAR ISOTYPE AND FOR FINE SPECIFICITY BY INHIBITION ASSAYS. THE PANEL OF EXISTING AND NEW ANTI-ID ANTIBODIES WILL BE USED TO SCREEN FOR EXPRESSION OF CROSS-REACTIVE ID'S BY B-CELL MALIGNANCIES AND HUMAN IMMUNOGLOBULINS OF CLINICAL AND RESEARCH INTEREST. THIS APPROACH COULD SPARE PATIENTS AND RESEARCHERS THE LONG DELAY IN PRODUCING TAILORMADE ANTI-ID ANTIBODIES, PROVIDING THEM WITH REAGENTS FOR IMMEDIATE USE TO MONITOR OR TREAT B-CELL DISORDERS. A PANEL OF CROSS-REACTIVE ANTIBODIES WOULD LOWER THE COSTS OF ANTI-ID PRODUCTION AND ENHANCE THEIR ROLE IN CLINICAL RESEARCH.",

THE OBJECT OF THIS PROJECT IS TO EXAMINE THE POTENTIAL OF CONVERTING THIS RESEARCH FINDING INTO A FAST AND RELIABLE TOOL FOR THE FRACTIONATION AND CHARACTERIZATIONOF CELLS IN SAMPLES OF CLINICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL INTEREST. IN FLOW/STFFF, SAMPLE PARTICLES ARE SUBJECTED TO A CROSS-FLOW FIELD WHILE BEING CARRIED ALONG BY A CARRIER LIQUID IN A RIBBONLIKE THIN CHANNEL WITH PERMEABLE WALLS. CELL PARTICLES WILL ELUTE DEPENDING ON THEIR SIZE AND SHAPE AND, IN SOME CASES, DENSITY. AS THESE PARAMETERS ARE REFLECTED IN THE ELUTION PROFILES OR FRACTOGRAMS, THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN NORMAL AND ABNORMAL CELLS CAN BE IDENTIFIED BY OBSERVING THE PATTERN OF THE FRACTOGRAMS. THIS METHOD WILL BE STUDIED FOR ITS POSSIBLE ROUTINE APPLICATION TO CELL POPULATIONS. IN PARTICULAR, ITS APPLICABILITY TO THE DIAGNOSIS OF ABNORMAL HUMAN RED BLOOD CELLS WILL BE EXAMINED. THE ABILITY OF FLOW/STFFF TO ISOLATE PURE CELL POPULATIONS OF VIABLE CELLS WILL ALSO RECEIVE MAJOR ATTENTION. THE METHOD, ONCE DEVELOPED, SHOULD BE RELATIVELY SIMPLE AND COST EFFECTIVE. THE ANALYSIS TIME WITH THIS METHOD IS NOW APPROXIMATELY 1 TO 5 MINUTES FOR A SAMPLE, WITH ADDITIONAL REDUCTION POSSIBLE.

THUS, THE THERMAL STABILITY OF JET FUELS HAS THE DELETERIOUS EFFECT OF CAUSING FUEL SYSTEM MALFUNCTIONS. THIS SITUATION IS ALSO POSSIBLE IN SUPERSONIC AIRCRAFT, WHERE AN INCREASE IN THE METAL SKIN TEMPERATURE DUE TO AERODYNAMIC HEATING CAN, IN TURN, INCREASE THE TEMPERATURE OF UNINSULATED FUEL TANKS, LEADING TO DEPOSIT FORMATION. ALTHOUGH A GREAT DEAL OF EXPERIMENTAL DATA HAS BEEN OBTAINED, THE EXACT MECHANISMS OF THE DEGRADATION REACTION AND THE CONSEQUENT DEPOSIT FORMATION PROCESS ARE STILL LARGELY UNKNOWN. THIS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE DEGRADATION PROCESS IS INFLUENCED BY MANY FACTORS, SOME OF WHICH CANNOT BE DETERMINED, VARIED OR CONTROLLED IN AN EXPERIMENT. THUS, THERE IS A NEED FOR A MATHEMATICAL MODEL THAT CAN BE USED TO PREDICT THE FUEL DEPOSITION PROCESS BY COMBINING THE EFFECTS OF THE FLUID FLOW AND HEAT TRANSFER PROCESSES AND THE FUEL DEGRADATION REACTIONS. IN THIS PHASE I STUDY, A SIMPLE MATHEMATICAL MODEL WILL BE DEVELOPED USING AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON THE VARIOUS UNIT PROCESSES INVOLVED IN THE DEPOSIT FORMATION PROCESS.

EACH FLAW POTENTIALLY DEGRADES THE LIFE OF THE BLADE, BUT FOR ECONOMIC REASONS MANY INITIAL FLAW CLASSES ARE PERMITTED ON THE BASIS OF ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA DEVELOPED EMPIRICALLY BY ENGINE MANUFACTURERS. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS APPROACH IS THAT IT REQUIRES DATA OBTAINED FROM EXPERIENCE. IT CANNOT PREDICT BLADE LIFE IN A NEW ENGINE. MOREOVER, MANY BLADES CONTAINING A CHARACTERISTIC FLAWS CAN BE IN USE BEFORE SUCH A FLAW IS FOUND TO REDUCE SUBSTANTIALLY EXPECTED LIFE. WE PROPOSE TO CREATE A HIGHLY INTERACTIVE, COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN SYSTEM TO SIMULATE THE PERFORMANCE OF A BLADE CONTAINING SPECIFIC FLAWS AND FLAW SIZES AT ARBITRARY LOCATIONS. THE SYSTEM WILL HAVE THE FOLLOWING INNOVATIVE FEATURES: SIMULATION BASED ON A TRUE GEOMETRIC REPRESENTATION OF THE BLADE VIA SOLID MODELING. A SOPHISTICATED, TOPOLOGY-BASED DATA STRUCTURE TO SUPPORT LINKAGE TO THE SOLID MODEL, FAST INTERACTION, AND ACCURATE REPRESENTATION OF EVOLVING FLAW SHAPES. THE ABILITY TO SPECIFY FLAWS TO ARBITRARY SHAPE, INCLUDING NON-PLANAR, SIZE, AND ORIENTATION AT ARBITRARY LOCATIONS IN THE GEOMETRIC MODEL. AUTOMATIC LOCAL REMESHING TO SIMULATE FLAW GROWTH.

THE ACTIVE REGENERATORS ACT AS IF THEY HAVE AN INFINITE SPECIFIC HEAT. PREVIOUS WORK INVOLVED MORE CONVENTIONAL MATERIALS AND INTERACTION WITH THE CRYOCOOLER WORKING FLUID, RESULTING IN INFERIOR PERFORMANCE. OUR THREE CONCEPTS ARE IMPORTANT TO NASA'S VARIOUS MISSIONS.MANY NASA PAYLOADS DEPEND ON COOLING INFRA-RED SENSORS TO TEMPERATURES ON THE ORDER OF 2 K. SUCH TEMPERATURES CAN CURRENTLY BE ATTAINED ONLY WITH REFRIGERATION THAT USES LIQUID HELIUM AS THE WORKING MEDIUM. THE PROPOSED CONCEPTS CAN REDUCE SIGNIFICANTLY THE COST OF LIQUID HELIUM IN SPACE.FOR EXAMPLE, THE COST OF PRODUCING LIQUID HELIUM ON EARTH WOULD BE DECREASED. MORE IMPORTANTLY, HELIUM CRYOCOOLERS MAY BECOME PRACTICAL IN SPACE, WHEREAS CURRENTLY THEY ARE SOIMPRACTICAL THAT HELIUM MUST BE RE-SUPPLIED FROM EARTH.",

SHOULD FEASIBILITY BE DETERMINED, AND EVENTUALLY COMMERCIALIZED, THE ABILITY OF WATER REACTORS TO WITHSTAND SEVERE ACCIDENTS WOULD BE ENHANCED. WITH TODAYS METAL CLAD FUEL, A RELATIVELY SHORT TIME PERIOD IS AVAILABLE AFTER A LOSS OF COOLANT ACCIDENT BEFORE EMERGENCY CORE COOLING SYSTEMS MUST RECOVER THE CORE TO PREVENT FUEL DAMAGE. THE METAL CLADDING LOSES ITS STRENGTH AT RELATIVELY LOW TEMPERATURES (2200 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT). FURTHERMORE, WHEN THE METAL CLADDOES OVERHEAT AND IS SUBSEQUENTLY QUENCHED WITH WATER, IT REACTS EXOTHERMICALLY TO PRODUCE ADDITIONAL HEAT. ALTHOUGH THE FUEL PELLETS THEMSELVES ARE CERAMICS, WITH MELTING TEMPERATURES ON THE ORDER OF 5000 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT, CLADDING WHICH SUPPORTS AND CONTAINS THE FUEL PELLETS HAS ALWAYS BEEN FABRICATED USING LOWER MELTING METAL ALLOYS; CERAMICS WITH THE REQUIRED STRENGTH AND DUCTILITY WERE SIMPLY NOT AVAILABLE. RECENT TECHNICAL ADVANCES IN THE FIELD OF CERAMICS HAS PRODUCED NEW MATERIALS WITH DRAMATIC INCREASES IN DUCTILITY, STRENGTH AND FABRICABILITY. THIS PROJECT INVESTIGATES WHETHER THESE NEW DEVELOPMENTS WILL PERMIT USE OF CERAMIC FUEL CLADDING AND, THEREBY, REDUCE THE POTENTIAL SEVERITY OF CERTAIN ACCIDENTS IN WATER COOLED REACTORS.",

IN ORDER TO REDUCE POST-DEPOSITION ANNEALING TIME AND EXPOSURE OF HIGH TEMPERATURE, A NOVEL ANNEALING PROCESS WILL BE EMPLOYED. THIS PROCESS INVOLVES THE USE OF AN ACTIVE SPECIES OF MOLECULAR OXYGEN, SPECIFICALLY DELTA SINGLET OXYGEN, AT CONCENTRATIONS OF UP TO 80%. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE PLANNED REDUCTION IN TIME AT TEMPERATURE OF THE ANNEALING PROCESS WILL FAVORABLY LIMIT INTERATION BETWEEN THE SUBSTRATE AND THE DEPOSITED HIGH TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTOR. ADDITIONALLY, A PLASMA DEPOSITION/FABRICATION PROCESS FOR HOLLOW STRUCTURES WILL BE DEVELOPED - INVOLVING THE USE OF SACRIFICIAL MANDRELS.

THE REMARKABLE OVERALL SEQUENCE SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE LP(A) ANTIGEN, APO(A), AND THE PLASMA PROTEASE PLASMINOGEN RESULTS IN EXTENSIVE IMMUNOLOGICAL CROSS-REACTIVITY.

THE SEQUENCE SIMILARITY OF APO(A) AND PLASMINOGEN PRESENTS MAJOR PROBLEMS FOR MONOSPECIFIC ANTIBODY PRODUCTION.

THE SENSOR IS BASED ON THE ELASTO-OPTIC EFFECT IN OPTICAL CRYSTALS. THE SENSING ELEMENT IS AN OPTICAL CRYSTAL, AND BECAUSE NO MOVING PARTS ARE INVOLVED, WEAR AND FATIGUE ARE REDUCED TO A MINIMUM. BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LINEARITY AND LOW DRIFT, THE PROPOSED PRESSURE SENSOR WILL BE IDEAL FOR MONITORING PRESSURE IN SHIPBOARD SONAR DOMES. PRESSURE ALTERS THE BIREFRINGENCE PROPERTIES OF CRYSTALS AND CHANGES THE STATE OF POLARIZATION OF LIGHT PASSING THROUGH THE CRYSTAL. THE GOAL OF THE PHASE I RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORT IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS PRESSURE SENSING TECHNIQUE. SUITABLE OPTICAL MATERIALS WILL BE IDENTIFIED THROUGH A LITERATURE SURVEY. THE HIGHEST RANKED CRYSTAL MATERIALS WILL BE TESTED UNDER HYDROSTATIC PRESSURES.

THE DATA FOR PICTURING THIS SUBSURFACE GEOLOGY COMES FROM THREE-DIMENSIONAL (3D) SEISMICSURVEYS. HOWEVER, THESE 3D SEISMIC DATA ARE EXCEEDINGLY COMPLEX, AND AN ACCURATE COMPREHENSION OF THE DATA BY THE PERSON INTERPRETING IT IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL. THIS NEW APPROACH TO UNDERSTANDING 3D SEISMIC DATA WILL CREATE THREE-DIMENSIONAL APPEARING STEREO-SCOPIC SEISMIC DISPLAYS. THESE NOVEL DISPLAYS ARE A POWERFUL NEW TOOL FOR SPATIALLY VISUALIZING IN GREAT DETAIL THE ANATOMY OF A RESERVOIR. THE STEREOSCOPIC SEISMIC DISPLAYS ARE ALSO WELL SUITED TO IMAGING AND MONITORING CHANGES TAKING PLACE OVER TIME WITHINA RESERVOIR. PHASE I CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING TASKS: GATHER SEISMIC-SIMULATING, GROUND-PENETRATING RADAR DATA OF SUITABLE NEAR-SURFACE GEOLOGY; IMAGE PROCESS AND COMBINE INTO STEREOSCOPIC DISPLAYS; EVALUATE DIGITAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROCESS; AND PREPARE PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC AND ENGINEERING ANALYSIS OF REAL-TIME DIGITAL IMPLEMENTATION OF 3D DISPLAYS OF SEISMIC DATA.",

IT IS PROPOSED THAT THE PERMEABILITY BE EVALUATED THROUGH USE OF AIR AS A PERMEANT RATHER THAN A LIQUID. ADVANTAGES OF MEASURING AIR INSTEAD OF LIQUID PERMEABILITY INCLUDES (1) FLOW RATES INCREASED BY THE REDUCED VISCOSITY, GREATLY REDUCING TESTING TIME, (2) NO NEED TO TRANSPORT THE PERMEANTTO THE TEST SITE, (3) NO REQUIREMENT FOR SATURATING THE TEST AREA, (4) AVOIDING CAPILLARY SUCTION AND WETTING EFFECTS, (5) REMOVING GRAVITATIONAL DRIVE, AND (6) A POSSIBILITY FOR UTILIZING THE COMPRESSIBILITY OF AIR TO DRIVE THE SYSTEM FOR ONE-SHOT DETERMINATIONS. DETERMINATION OF AIR PERMEABILITY BY BOTH STEADY STATE AND DYNAMIC FLOW CONDITIONS IS PROPOSED.

THE INNOVATIVE CONCEPT PROPOSED IS THE USE OF A DIGITALLY FOCUSED AND SCANNED MICROWAVE ARRAY RADAR DETECTION SYSTEM USING BISTATIC OBLIQUE FORWARD SCATTERING TO REDUCE GROUND SURFACE REFLECTIONS. THE SYSTEM FORMS A HIGH RESOLUTION THREE-DIMENSIONAL IMAGE OF THE MEDIUM WHICH ALLOWS A MINE TO BE BOTH DETECTED AND IDENTIFIED BY ITS IMAGE. THE SYSTEM USED A HIGH POWER FOCUSED MICROWAVE ARRAY FOR DESTRUCTION OF THE MINE BY MICROWAVE HEATING. THE GOAL OF THE DETECTION SYSTEM IS TO OBTAIN BETTER THAN 5 CM RESOLUTION IN THREE DIMENSIONS, HIGH SPEED IMAGING OF THE MEDIUM AND TARGET ALLOWING A HIGH RATE OF FORWARD MOTION, AND SUB-SURFACE TRANSMISSION APPROACHING 100%.

ALTHOUGH THE SYNTHESIZER GENERATOR IS NOT CURRENTLY A FULLY-ENGINEERED COMMERCIAL PRODUCT, WE BELIEVE IT TO BE AN EXCELLENT BASIS FOR ONE. FUNDS ARE REQUESTED FOR A DETAILED ENGINEERING STUDY TO (1) SPECIFY THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF A PROPOSED SYNTHESIZER GENERATOR PRODUCT, (2) DESIGN THE IMPLEMENTATIONSAND/OR CHARACTERIZE THE RESEARCH NEEDED TO MEET THOSE REQUIREMENTS, AND (3) ESTIMATE THE COST AND OUTLINE A REALISTIC SCHEDULE FOR COMPLETING SUCH A PROJECT.",

BECAUSE ANIMAL MODELS OF THE COGNITIVE DISORDERS OF AGING EXIST, IT IS DESIRABLE TO STUDY HORMONAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE DEFICITS IN ANIMALS. WITH TRADITIONAL METHODS, IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO MAKE MEANINGFUL MEASUREMENTS OF THE ENDURING ENDOCRINE STATUS OF AN INDIVIDUAL ANIMAL SUBJECT. THESE DIFFICULTIES ARISE BECAUSE THE HORMONES TO BE MEASURED ARE EXTREMELY REACTIVE TO STRESS, ARE NORMALLY SECRETED IN AN EPISODIC OR PULSATILE WAY, AND ARE PREDOMINANTLY PRESENT IN THE CIRCULATION IN PROTEIN-BOUND FORMS THAT ARE NOT DIRECTLY AVAILABLE TO TISSUE. THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO DEVELOP A SIMPLE, CONVENIENT, AND RELIABLE METHOD FOR MAKING CONTINUOUS AND REPEATED MEASUREMENTS OVER SEVERAL DAYS OF THE TISSUE AVAILABILITY OF CORTICOSTEROID HORMONES IN ANIMAL SUBJECTS. THE METHOD USES AN INJECTABLE, CHRONICALLY IMPLANTED DEVICE TO CONTINUOUSLY ACCUMULATE THE HORMONE OF INTEREST AT A RATE PROPORTIONAL TO ITS INTERSTITIAL FLUID CONCENTRATION. ACCUMULATION OF THE HORMONE OVER A DISCRETE TIME INTERVAL, THEREFORE, REFLECTS THE TIME INTEGRAL OF ITS TISSUE AVAILABILITY. BECAUSE CONTACT WITH THE ANIMAL SUBJECT IS GENTLE AND ONLY NECESSARY AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF A MEASUREMENT INTERVAL, STRESS ARTIFACTS ARE MINIMIZED.",

THIS COMPOUND IS CURRENTLY IN CLINICAL TRIALS AS AN ANTITUMOR AGENT. AVAILABLE BIOASSAY AND HIGH-PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY METHODS FOR DETECTING DIDEMNINS IN BIOLOGICAL MATRICES LACK THE PRECISION AND SENSITIVITY REQUIRED FOR PHARMACOKINETIC AND DRUG METABOLISM STUDIES. IT IS PLANNED TO SYNTHESIZE WELL-CHARACTERIZED DIDEMNIN A-DERIVED IMMUNOGENS THAT SHOULD ELICIT ANTIBODY RESPONSES. THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED BY COUPLING DIDEMNIN A TO IMMUNOGENIC CARRIERS VIA ITS N-METHYL-D-LEUCINE SIDE CHAIN TO EXPOSE THE MACROCYCLIC EPITOPE COMMON AMONG ALL DIDEMNINS. EARLIER ATTEMPTS FAILED TO DEVELOP A RADIOIMMUNOASSAY, POSSIBLY BECAUSE OF THE STRONG IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE ACTION OF DIDEMNIN B. HOWEVER, BECAUSE DIDEMNIN A IS LESS POTENT THAN DIDEMNIN B, CAREFUL MANIPULATION OF IMMUNIZATION PARAMETERS SUCH AS CHOICE OF IMMUNOGENIC CARRIER, IMMUNIZINGDOSE, ROUTE OF IMMUNIZATION, ADJUVANT TYPE, AND PRIOR PRIMING WITH IMMUNOGENIC CARRIER IS EXPECTED TO EVOKE HUMORAL IMMUNE RESPONSES.

TWO MAJOR LIMITATIONS IN THE ASSESSMENT AND MONITORING OF THE QUALITY AND LEVEL OF DELIVERED NURSING CARE ARE: (1) A LACK OF MEASURABLE, OBJECTIVE CRITERIA SPECIFIC TO THE PATIENT'S RESPONSES TO ILLNESS; AND (2) A LACK OF RAPID RETRIEVAL OF NURSING CARE DATA. A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY EXISTS TO DEVELOP A TOOL THAT OVERCOMES THESE LIMITATIONS. HEALTHLINK SYSTEMS, INC., WILL DEVELOP A MICROCOMPUTER SOFTWARE MODEL THAT GENERATES A NURSING PLAN OF CARE DIRECTLY FROM THE OPERATIVE VARIABLE, THE PATIENT'S RESPONSES TO ILLNESS. THEREFORE, THE ENTRY OF SUBSEQUENT NURSING ASSESSMENTS FOR THE PATIENT WILL EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF NURSING INTERVENTIONS IN THE TREATMENT OF THE PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED RESPONSES.

SINCE THE HIGHEST REPORTED Z OF B-C ALLOYS AT 1,000 DEGREES CENTIGRADE IS 0.85 X 10(-3) DEGREES CENTIGRADE, THERE IS REASON TO BELIEVE A Z OF >1.2 X 10(-3) AT 1,200 DEGREES CENTIGRADE IS ACHIEVABLE.

VSSP IS A MODIFIED CELLULOSE FIBER MANUFACTURING PROCESS BASED ON ESTABLISHED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGIES AND USING EXISTING INSTALLED PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT. IN THE ENVISIONED PROCESS, A SUITABLE Y-BA- CU-O OR OTHER HIGH TC SUPERCONDUCTING FINE POWDER IS INCORPORATED INTO A DESTRUCTIBLE, FIBER-FORMING CARRIER. CARRIER FIBERS FILLED WITH SUPERCONDUCTING MATERIALS ARE FORMED IN THE USUAL WAY BY EITHER WET- OR DRY- SPINNING. THE DESTRUCTIBLE CARRIER IS THEN REMOVED, AND THE REMAINING POWDER SINTERED AND HEAT-TREATED TO YIELD COHERENT FILAMENTS. PRELIMINARY TESTS HAVE SHOWN PROMISE, BUT MORE WORK IS NEEDED BEFORE THEPROCESS YIELDS A PRACTICAL, FLEXIBLE SUPERCONDUCTING MULTIFILAMENT CABLE OR WIRE. FUNDAMENTAL EXPERIMENTS IN PHASE I WILL EXAMINE SUCH KEY AREAS AS THE ATTAINMENT OF A HIGH SOLID FRACTION IN THE \"GREEN\" FILAMENT, CONTROL OF VSSPWITH VARIOUS PARTICLE LOADINGS, MECHANICAL AND CRYSTALLIZATION TECHNIQUES FOR ACHIEVING PREFERRED CRYSTAL ORIENTATION, CHEMICAL REACTIONS BETWEEN CARRIER AND HIGH TC CERAMIC POWDERS AND THEIR EFFECT, \"GREEN\" FILAMENT MECHANICAL STRENGTH, AND PROCESS ISSUES WITH HIGH TEMPERATURE DENSIFICATION OF FILAMENTS. THE WORK PLAN IS FOCUSED ON MAXIMIZING BOTH THE CRITICAL CURRENT (JC) AND MECHANICAL STRENGTH OF THE SUPERCONDUCTING FILAMENTS.",

IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A HIGH DEGREE OF PROTECTIVE IMMUNITY, \"BOOSTER\" IMMUNIZATIONS ARE OFTEN REQUIRED. IMMUNIZATION OF LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE, THEREFORE, PRESENTS A LOGISTICS PROBLEM. THE PROPOSED DELIVERY SYSTEM EMPLOYS THE USE OF POLY(LACTIC/GLYCOLIC) ACID (PLGA). VACCINE PREPARATIONS COULD BE INCORPORATED IN THE PLGA COPOLYMER AS MICROPARTICLES AND ADMINISTERED INTRAMUSCULARLY FOR IMMUNIZATION AGAINST A NUMBER OF PARASITIC, VIRAL, AND BACTERIAL INFECTIONS. IN THIS NOVEL SYSTEM, SOME OF THE MICROPARTICLES WOULD IMMEDIATELY RELEASE VACCINE OVER A PERIOD OF THREE TO SEVEN DAYS; OTHER MICROPARTICLES PRESENT IN THE INITIAL INJECTION WOULD HAVE A DELAYED RELEASE CHARACTERISTIC (TWO TO FOUR WEEKS), AND WOULD FINALLY RELEASE THEIR BOUND VACCINE MATERIAL ALSO OVER THREE TO SEVEN DAY PERIOD, SIMULATING A SECOND VACCINE INJECTION. THE PRIMARY GOAL OF PHASE I WILL BE TO DEVELOP A MODEL PROTEIN FORMULATION WHICH RELEASES THE PROTEIN IN AN UNALTERED STATE, WITH AN OPTIMAL RELEASE PATTERN FOR STIMULATING IMMUNOGENICITY, AND WHICH HAS AN OPTIMAL ADJUVANT EFFECT.",

A CHEMICAL OXYGEN COMPRESSOR IS APPEALING, YET CURRENT MATERIALS ARE LIMITED BY A LOW WEIGHT FRACTION OF OXYGEN; E.G. PR1-NCDNOO.13 (PCO) WITH 1.5% BY WEIGHT. THE KEY INNOVATION PROPOSED HEREIN IS THE ADAPTATION OF THE EXPERTISE AND WELL-EQUIPPED FACILITIES OF HCI IN FORMULATINGLONG-LIFE PROCESSED MATERIALS, WITH THE CORRECT PHYSICAL ANDCHEMICAL PROPERTIES TO EASILY COMPRESS HYDROGEN, WHICH IF SUCCESSFUL WILL DO THE SAME FOR OXYGEN. THE MOST IMPORTANT PHYSICAL PROPERTY IS THAT OF LARGE SURFACE AREAS FOR BOTH THE UNOXIDIZED AND OXIDIZED MATERIALS. THE MOST IMPORTANT CHEMICAL PROPERTY IS GOOD REVERSIBILITY OF THE UNOXIDIZED/OXIDIZED MATERIAL INTERCONVERSION. THE CHIEF IMPROVEMENTS EXPECTED ARE AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE INCREASE IN THE OXYGEN WEIGHT LOADING OVER PCO, AND A LOWER MAXIMUM OPERATING TEMPERATURE.

APPROXIMATELY 500,000 PERSONS SUFFER A TBI EACH YEAR, WITH TOTAL ANNUAL COSTS ESTIMATED TO REACH $4 BILLION. A LARGE PORTION OF TBI PATIENTS ARE LEFT WITH PERMANENT MEMORY OR OTHER NEUROBEHAVIORAL DEFICITS. THE IMPD IS BASED ON A HAND-HELD COMPUTER THAT PROMPTS THE PATIENT IN REAL TIME FOR THE INITIATION AND COMPLETION OF TASKS. THE IMPD SOFTWARE IS FLEXIBLY DATA DRIVEN BY A DOWNLOADED THERAPIST'S PRESCRIPTION AND CONTAINS CLOCK, CALENDAR, ALARM, AND TWO-WAY COMMUNICATIONS FUNCTIONS TO SUPPORT CUING, MONITORING, AND REINFORCEMENT OF PATIENT BEHAVIORS. THERAPIST DESKTOP SOFTWARE HAS BEEN DESIGNED FOR THE ASSESSMENT AND PROGRAMMING OF THE PATIENT'S IMPD-ASSISTED THERAPY. THE PERFECTED IMPD SYSTEM WILL HAVE IMMEDIATE AND DIRECT APPLICABILITY TO OTHER LARGE CLINICAL POPULATIONS SUFFERING COGNITIVE DEFICITS INDUCED BY STROKE, ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, AND OTHER DEMENTIAS. ADDITIONALLY, THE IMPD COULD BE EMPLOYED IN NORMAL POPULATIONS FOR TIME MANAGEMENT, HABIT TRAINING, AND OTHER FORMS OF BEHAVIOR THERAPY, AND AS A \"PEOPLE METER\" FOR USE IN BOTH MEDICAL AND MARKETING RESEARCH.",

I.S. GRUPE, INC., WILL PROCESS THOSE DATA INTO A SUITABLE UNIFORM FORMAT, LOAD THEM ONTO A CD-ROM, AND MAKE THEM AVAILABLE ON A MICROCOMPUTER. A FEW OF THE QUESTIONS THAT THIS SYSTEM WOULD ANSWER ARE: (1) FINDING OUT WHETHER A PERSON WITH A KNOWN SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER (SSN) HAS DIED; (2) FINDING THE SSN OF A PERSON FOR WHOM OTHER INFORMATION IS KNOWN (I.E., NAME, BIRTHPLACE, BIRTHDATE, MOTHER'S MAIDEN NAME); AND (3) PROVIDING DATA TO FILL OUT A REQUEST FOR A COPY OF THE STATE DEATH CERTIFICATE FOR A PERSON WITH KNOWN NAME AND BIRTHDATE BUT UNKNOWN PLACE OF DEATH. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE PHASE II SYSTEM WILL INVOLVE 4 TO 10CD-ROM DISKS, WILL PROCESS TYPICAL REQUESTS IN A FEW SECONDS, AND WILL PROCESS DIFFICULT ONES IN A COUPLE OF HOURS-AN IMPROVEMENT OVER CURRENT PRACTICES BY MORE THAN AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE IN TIME AND COST.",

THE LIFE OF THE COLLECTOR SYSTEM DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF COMMUTATION. MOST DC COMMUTATING COLLECTOR SYSTEMS RELY ON AN ARC TO COMMUTATE THE CURRENT. EROSION OF THE COLLECTOR SYSTEM ACCOMPANIES THE ARC. THE EROSION CAN LIMIT THE LIFE OF THE SYSTEM TO A FEW SHOTS. OPERATION IN SEA WATER IMPOSES CORROSION, BIOFOULING, AND VOLTAGE STANDOFF DESIGN ISSUES NOT NORMALLY ENCOUNTERED IN COLLECTOR SYSTEM DESIGN. THESE ISSUES MUST BE ANALYZED AND UNDERSTOOD. IN ADDITION, OPERATING THE SLIDING CONTACT SYSTEM IN WATER WILL CREATE A HYDRODYNAMIC LIFTING FORCE THAT MUST BE ACCOUNTED FOR. THE LIFTING FORCE WILL TEND TO UNLOAD THE ELECTRICAL CONTACTS, AND INCREASE THE COMMUTATION EROSION. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP THE DESIGN OF A NON-ARCING, RESISTIVE COMMUTATION CURRENT COLLECTOR SYSTEM.

        "abstract": "Abstract         A PROGRAM IS PROPOSED TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF FORMING IMPROVED SIMOX MATERIAL BY CONTOURING THE ENERGY OF THE INCIDENT OXYGEN IONS. DURING THE IMPLANTATION PROCESS OF SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF SUBSTRATE MATERIAL IS REMOVED BY SPUTTERING. ALTHOUGH THE RANGE R(P) OF INCIDENT IONS REMAINS CONSTANT, TO FIRST ORDER, DURING THE IMPLANT, THE SPUTTERING AWAY OF THE SURFACE CAUSES INCIDENT IONS TO COME TO REST DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE SUBSTRATE. THE MAIN FOCUS OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF A STEPWISE REDUCTION IN THE BEAM ENERGY TO COMPENSATE FOR SURFACE EROSION BY SPUTTERING. THIS IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN THE FORMATION OF A CONTINUOUS BURIED DIELECTRIC LAYER AT A LOWER DOSE I.E. USING A SHORTER IMPLANT TIME AND THUS AT A REDUCED COST. A SUBSIDIARY GOAL WILL BE TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF INCREASING THE BEAM ENERGY DURING THE IMPLANT THEREBY ENHANCING THE EFFECT OF SPUTTERING. THIS TECHNIQUE IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN THE FORMATION OF A THICKER INSULATING LAYER WITH HIGHER BREAKDOWN STRENGTH. WAFERS WILL BE IMPLANTED, ANNEALED AND THE THICKNESS OF THE SURFACE SILICON LAYER AND THE BURIED OXYGEN LAYER WILL BE MEASURED. THIS STUDY WILL FORMTHE BASIS FOR A PHASE II PROGRAM DURING WHICH THE PROCESSES WILL BE REFINED AND EXTENSIVE ANALYTICAL QUALITY STUDIES OF THE LAYERS WILL BE STUDIED, AND TEST DEVICES FABRICATED. SELECTION OF THE PROPER SIMOX MATERIAL IMPLANT TEMPERATURE, COMBINED WITH OPTIMUM ANNEAL CONDITIONS, ENABLES THE HIGHEST QUALITY SIMOX MATERIAL TO BE PRODUCED. SINCE OPTIMUM ANNEALING CONDITIONS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN ESTABLISHED,THIS PROGRAM EVALUATES THE OPTIMUM IMPLANT TEMPERATURE FOR SIMOX. SIMOX MATERIAL CAN BE PRODUCED MORE ECONOMICALLY AT HIGHER IMPLANT TEMPERATURE; IT IS THEREFORE, CRUCIAL TO ESTABLISH THE HIGHEST IMPLANT TEMPERATURE POSSIBLE. HOWEVER, THE RETENTION OF ABSORBED OXYGEN THERMAL DONORS IN THE SUPERFICIAL SILICON LAYER MAY LIMIT THE MAXIMUM IMPLANT TEMPERATURE USED. ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES WHICH CAN MEASURE OXYGEN LEVELS BELOW THE SIMS LIMIT ARE ALSO BEING INVESTIGATED IN THIS STUDY. APPLICATIONS INCLUDE MATERIAL FOR GOVERNMENT SPECIFIED RADIATION HARDENED CMOS AND BIPOLARCIRCUITRY.",

THE PRIMARY OBSTACLE TO THE USE OF THESE MATERIALS IS THE PRESENT INABILITY TO PRODUCE MATERIAL IN USABLE FORMS WITH ADEQUATE CURRENT CARRYING ABILITY AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES. THE PRESENT PROJECT INVOLVES INVESTIGATION OF THE FEASIBILITY OF FABRICATING SUPERCONDUCTING OXIDE COMPOSITE WIRES WITH SUPERIOR MECHANICAL AND ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES USING A NOVEL APPROACH CENTERED ON ROOM TEMPERATURE DEFORMATION PROCESSING OF SPECIAL POWER MIXTURES. IF SUCCESSFUL, THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH TECHNOLOGY COULD QUICKLY TAKE ADVANCES IN CERAMIC SUPERCONDUCTORS TO THE MARKETPLACE.",

IMPROVEMENTSINCLUDE A RELIABLE LASER PULSE METHOD TO GENERATE THE ULTRASONIC SIGNAL AND ANALYSIS OF THE RETURN SIGNAL IN TERMSOF AMPLITUDE, TIME AND FREQUENCY. A NOVEL FLAT FREQUENCY RESPONSE ULTRASONIC TRANSDUCER WILL AID THE FREQUENCY ANALYSIS. THE LOW-POWER LASER INPUT TRANSDUCER IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE RELATIVELY HIGH IMPULSE AMPLITUDES BECAUSE OF THECHARACTERISTIC ACOUSTIC IMPEDANCE AND THERMAL PROPERTIES OF THE CONCRETE. ONE MAJOR OBJECTIVE OF THE PROGRAM IS THE DETERMINATION OF THE OPTIMUM LASER CONDITIONS IN TERMS OF LASERPOWER, PULSE WIDTH AND SPOT SIZE. SIGNAL DETECTION IN THE PLANNED PULSE-ECHO APPROACH WILL INCLUDE WORK WITH BOTH CONVENTIONAL ULTRASONIC TRANSDUCERS AND A NOVEL FLAT-RESPONSE TRANSDUCER. EACH OF THESE WILL BE INVESTIGATED TO DETERMINE THE SIGNAL ANALYSIS METHOD TO OPTIMIZE INSPECTION INTERPRETATION FOR CONCRETE DEGRADATION AND CRACKING. THE FEASIBILITY STUDY WILL PAVE THE WAY TO DEVELOP A BROADLY USEFUL SYSTEM TO INSPECT CONCRETE. GOOD COMMERCIAL PROSPECTS CLEARLY EXIST FOR AN IMPROVED METHOD TOINSPECT CONCRETE IN THE FIELD.",

THE BASIC TECHNOLOGY EXPLORED WILL BE AN ENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY UTILIZING VARIOUS TYPES OF PROTEIN- AND NUCLEIC-ACID-BINDING MEMBRANES AS A SOLID-PHASE SUPPORT. CLINICALLY RELEVANT AUTOANTIGENS, EITHER FROM CRUDE TISSUE EXTRACTS, OR IMMUNOCHEMICALLY PURIFIED OR WELL-DEFINED CLONED ANTIGENS, WILL BE LINKED TO SUITABLE SOLID-PHASE MEMBRANE SUPPORTS.

RAPID SOLIDIFICATION WILL BE INCREASED BY THE CONTROLLED PRODUCTION OF SMALLER POWDER SIZES; IMPROVED POWDER MICROSTRUCTURE AND CHEMICAL HOMOGENEITY ARE DIRECTLY RELATEDTO SOLIDIFICATION RATES. CURRENT POWDERED METAL PRODUCTION MONITORING PRACTICES ARE LIMITED TO VISUAL OBSERVATION OF SPRAYS BY AN OPERATOR DURING THE PRODUCTION PROCESS AND A QUANTITATIVE SIEVE ANALYSIS AFTER PRODUCTION IS COMPLETED.

FORMAL OPTIMIZATION OF HIGH-SPEED VEHICLE CONFIGURATIONS IN TERMS OF MINIMIZING SOME COST FUNCTION HAS BEEN LIMITED TO SIMPLE AXISYMMETRIC SHAPES ADDRESSED USING SIMPLIFIED AERODYNAMIC THEORIES. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS ALLOW COMPLEX OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED NUMERICALLY, WHEREIN THE OPTIMIZATION PROCESS IS CONVERTED INTO A PROBLEM IN NONLINEAR PROGRAMMING. SPECIFICALLY, RESEARCHERS AT INTEGRATED SYSTEMS, INC., HAVE DEVELOPED A NEW INTERIOR QUADRATIC PROGRAMMING (QP) PROCEDURE FOR SOLVING SUBOPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS WITH FASTER CONVERGENCE THAN WAS PREVIOUSLY POSSIBLE. THE NEW QP ALGORITHM IS EMBEDDED WITHIN AN AUGMENTED LAGRANGIAN (AL) APPROACH FOR SOLVING GENERAL NONLINEAR PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS. ISI PROPOSES TO DEVELOP A GENERAL CONTROL-ORIENTED METHOD FOR SPECIFYING BODY OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM. THE BODY GEOMETRY SUBROUTINE WILL PROVIDE DEFINITION OF THE EXTERNAL SHAPES OF HYPERSONICVEHICLES FOR A COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS CODE THAT WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE INDEX. PERFORMANCE INDICES (COST FUNCTIONS) WILL BE CONSTRUCTED THAT REFLECT THE PRINCIPAL MEASURES OF MERIT, AND INEQUALITY CONSTRAINTS WILL BE APPLIED TO REPRESENT HEATING RATE AND COMPONENT PACKAGING CONSTRAINTS AT VARIOUS LEVELS. OPTIMIZATION RUNS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED TO DEFINE THE OPTIMUM BODY SHAPES FOR VARIOUS FLIGHT CONDITIONS.",

OF THE 13.5 MILLION PEOPLE WITH SEVERE PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS, APPROXIMATELY 6.0 MILLION WERE UNDER THE AGE OF 65. THE PURPOSE OF THIS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE POTENTIAL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A UNIQUE AND INEXPENSIVE LIGHT PEN SYSTEM FOR BASIC PROGRAMMING ON IBM PERSONAL COMPUTERS (PC'S). UNIQUE SYSTEM FEATURES WILL INCLUDE A SOFTWARE MODULE THAT ALLOWS THE LIGHT PEN TO SELECT PREDEFINED BASIC STATEMENTS AND KEYWORDS. A KEYBOARD WILL ALSO BE DISPLAYED ON THE SCREEN SO THAT VARIABLES AND FILE NAMES MAY BE INPUT BY USE OF THE LIGHT PEN. THE SYSTEM ALLOWS THE USER TO LOOK AT THE SCREEN WHILE USING THE PC AND DOES NOT REQUIRE FINE MOTOR COORDINATION TO PASS THE LIGHT PEN OVER THE GRIDS ON THE SCREEN.",

PROJECT EMPHASIS IS FIRST PLACED ON A NEW ABSTRACT MESSAGE STRUCTURE AT LEVEL 7, EMBRACING FIVE MESSAGE TYPES: INFORMATION UPDATE, FILE TRANSFER, COMMAND/ACTION, QUERY AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT/REPORT. THE SMALL SUITE OF EVENTS WHICH TRIGGER MESSAGES WILL BE IDENTIFIED AND MAY INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE: REPORT SIGHTINGS, FIRE WEAPONS, REQUET STATUS, CHANGE SHIP MOVEMENT. THE PROPOSED COMMON ENCODING PROTOCOL OF LEVEL 6 IS RECORD ORIENTED WITH STANDARD DATA FIELDS DEFINED BY THEIR SPECIFICATIONS AND ORDER WITHIN THE RECORD. ALSO, EACH RECORD IDENTIFIES ITS TYPE AND THE CODES USED FOR DELIMITERS AND CONTROLS. WITH THIS STANDARDIZATION OF SHIPBOARD OSI LEVELS 7-5, CUSTOM INTERFACING OF MULTIPLE PAIRS OF APPLICATIONS WILL BE REDUCED FROM N(N-L) UNITS TO (N+1) STANDARD VENDOR-FURNISHED INTERFACES. THIS PROJECT ORIENTATION IS BASED ON A SIMILAR NATIONWIDE UPPER-LEVEL STANDARDIZATION EFFORT FOR HOSPITAL COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS (HL-7) IN WHICH THE PROJECT PRINCIPALS ARE PROMINENT PARTICIPANTS.",

THERE IS ALSO A GROWING NEED TO ACHIEVE LOW OBSERVABILITY FROM A SURVIVABILITY AS WELL AS COVERTNESS VIEWPOINT. THE SPATIAL SPECTRAL INTERFEROMETER (SSI) SENSOR OFFERS A SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM. THE SSI IS A HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION, PASSIVE INFRARED SENSOR OF RELATIVELY LIGHT WEIGHT AND REQUIRES LESS DATA LINK CHANNELS AND HOTEL SERVICES. WHERE TARGET DETECTIVITY IS LIMITED BY CLUTTER, THIS SENSOR MAY HAVE ON THE ORDER OF 100 TIMES GREATER SIGNAL TO CLUTTER RATIOS. THUS, THE RPV ASSOCIATED MISSIONS, PARTICULARLY SEARCHING FROM RELOCATABLE TARGETS AND OTHER MOBILE SYSTEMS APPEARS TO BE POSSIBLE WITH THIS SENSOR. LOW OBSERVABILITY CAN BE MAINTAINED DURING DATA TRANSMISSION WHEN THE SENSOR SUITE AND OTHER ONBOARD REPORTING SYSTEMS ARE COUPLED TO A LASER RETROREFLECTOR, BIDIRECTIONAL COMMUNICATIONS LINK.

IMPROVED METHODS FOR TISSUE DISSOCIATION, TISSUE CULTURE, AND CRYOPRESERVATION OF MORE MATURE NEURONS WILL REDUCE THE NUMBERS OF ANIMALS REQUIRED FOR IN VITRO NEUROBIOLOGY IN SEVERAL WAYS. CRYOPRESERVATION ALLOWS EFFICIENT USE OF NEURONS FROM ENTIRE RODENT LITTERS OR FROM LARGER OR LESS READILY AVAILABLE FETUSES OR NEONATES. CRYOPRESERVATION, ALLOWING TRANSPORT OF CNS TISSUES AND CULTURE OF OLDER NEURONS, ALLOWS INVESTIGATORS, EVEN DISTANTLY LOCATED, TO USE MANY DIFFERENT CNS TISSUES FROM THE SAME ANIMAL, DESPITEVARIATIONS IN RELATIVE MATURITY OF THE NEURONS. THIS ENCOURAGES COLLABORATION USING LARGER OR LESS READILY AVAILABLE SPECIES THAT MAY BETTER REPRESENT HUMAN NEUROCHEMISTRY, NEUROPHYSIOLOGY, AND NEUROPATHOLOGY.

PRESENT TECHNIQUES FOR GENERATING ANDPROCESSING SEQUENCE DATA ARE SLOW AND LABORIOUS. THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO ESTABLISH THE FEASIBILITY OF A NEW INSTRUMENTAL APPROACH TO RAPIDLY DETERMINE THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF RADIOLABELED FRAGMENTS OF DNA IN ELECTROPHORESIS GELS. THE INSTRUMENT SYSTEM CONCEPT IS THAT OF A SINGLE-EVENT-COUNTING, TWO-DIMENSIONAL SCINTILLATION DETECTOR THAT PROVIDES DIGITIZED POSTION AND AMPLITUDE DATA FOR BETA-RAYS OR X-RAYS EMITTED BY A GEL FOR DISPLAY AND ANALYSIS BY A COMPUTER. THE INSTRUMENT WOULD BE 100 TO 1,000 TIMES MORE SENSITIVE THAN PRESENT TECHNIQUES. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE FEASIBILITY OF SUCH AN INSTRUMENT WILL BE ESTABLISHED BY MEANS OF ANALYTICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES THAT WILL RESULT IN A SET OF PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS AND A COMPARISON OF COMPONENT REQUIREMENTS WITH COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE COMPONENTS AS A BASIS FOR A PHASE II DEVELOPMENT EFFORT.",

REAL-TIME HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAYS HAVE LONG BEEN CONSIDERED IMPRACTICAL DUE TO THE EXTREMELY HIGH BANDWIDTH AND RESOLUTION REQUIREMENTS INVOLVED. THESE ARE BASED ON PAST ANALYSES OF CONVENTIONAL TRANSMISSION HOLOGRAMS, WHICH PROVIDE MUCH MORE INFORMATION THAN A HUMAN OBSERVER CAN USE. MORE RECENT STUDIES HAVE CONCLUDED THE INFORMATION CONTENT OF HOLOGRAMS CAN BE DRASTICALLY REDUCED WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT EFFECT UPON THE VISUAL IMPACT OF THE IMAGE. THE REQUIRED SPACE-BANDWIDTH PRODUCT CAN BE REDUCED TO THAT AVAILABLE WITH COMMERCIAL SPATIAL VIEWING SPACE. WITH THE ADVENT OF HIGH-SPEED PARALLEL ARCHITECTURE COMPUTERS, IT WILL SOON BE POSSIBLE TO UPDATE THE CONTENT OF SUCH HOLOGRAMS ON THE FLY, ESPECIALLY FOR DISPLAY OF PRECOMPUTED OBJECTS OR ICONS.",

IT CONSISTS OF AN ARRAY OF AFOCAL SUBTELESCOPES WHOSE EXISTING BEAMS ARE OPTICALLY COMBINED TO FORM A UNITED IMAGE WITH A THEORETICAL RESOLUTION APPROACHING THE DIFFRACTION LIMIT OF AN APETURE DIAMETER THAT IS EQUAL TO THE LONGEST DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TELESCOPES. IN DIFFERENCE TO THE PREVIOUS SYSTEMS THE NEW SYSTEM MUST OPERATE OVER A WIDE FIELD OF VIEW WHICH ADDS A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE OF COMPLEXITY TO THE DESIGN OF BOTH, THE SUBTELESCOPES AND THE COMBINING TELESCOPE. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUITABLE TELESCOPE DESIGNS WILL, THEREFORE, BE THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE PROPOSED EFFORT. THE SECOND IDEA IS BASED UPON THE CONCEPT OF A LARGE TELESCOPE WITH A PARTIALLY FILLED APERTURE. THE FACT THAT ALL OPTICAL COMPONENTS ARE COAXIAL SIMPLIFIES THE CONCEPT, AND GREATLY INCREASES THE CORRECTIBILITY. DIFFICULTIES ARE EXPECTED IN THE AREAS OF ALIGNMENT AND SURFACE GENERATION.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         CURRENTLY AVAILABLE AND WIDELY USED AROMATIC POLYAMIDE (PA) REVERSE OSMOSIS (RO) MEMBRANES HAVE VERY LOW TOLERANCE TO STRONG OXIDANTS, ESPECIALLY CHLORINE. CONSEQUENTLY, THERE IS A NEED FOR RO MEMBRANES THAT ARE NOT SUSCEPTIBLE TO DEGRADATION BY CHLORINE ATTACK. USING A CHEMICALLY MODIFIEDPOLYMER, A CHLORINE-RESISTANT RO MEMBRANE CAN BE PRODUCED. THE CHEMICAL MODIFICATION INVOLVES THE ADDITION OF NITRO GROUPS TO AN AROMATIC PA. NITRO SUBSTITUTION OF ELECTRON-RICH AROMATIC RINGS PROTECTS THE RING AGAINST CHLORINE REACTION WHILE INCREASING THE HYDROPHILIC CHARACTER OF THE POLYMER. COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE ARAMID POLYMERS WILL BE NITRATED AND CHARACTERIZED FOR DEGREE OF NITRATION, NITRATION GROUP FUNCTIONALITY, AND VISCOSITY. SUITABLE SOLVENTS WILL BE IDENTIFIED BOTH FOR POLYMER DISSOLUTION AND MEMBRANE CASTING. NITRATED PA MEMBRANES WILL BE TESTED FOR CHLORINE RESISTANCE AND FLUX/REJECTION CHARACTERISTICS. THE SKIN LAYER WILL BE EXAMINED FOR PORE SIZE AND PIN HOLES BY SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY. THIS PROGRAM WILL ESTABLISH THE TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY OF IMPROVING RO MEMBRANE CHLORINE RESISTANCE USING A NITRATED AROMATIC PA POLYMER. UF SUCCESSFUL, THE KNOWN CHARACTERISTIC OF NITRO GROUPS TO REDUCE THE REACTIVITY OF AROMATIC RINGS WITH CHLORINE WILL BE APPLIED TO COMMERCIAL PA MEMBRANES AS WELL AS TO AROMATIC POLYIMIDE MEMBRANES IN PHASE II.",

HOWEVER, WHEN DETECTED IN ASYMPTOMATIC CHILDREN AS A RESULT OF THE URINE TUMOR MARKERS SCREENING PROGRAM, THE NEUROBLASTOMA IS USUALLY LOCALIZED AND TREATABLE, AND THE OUTCOME IS FAVORABLE. MOST NEUROBLASTOMA CASES HAVE HIGH URINE LEVELS OF HOMOVANILLIC ACID (HVA) AND/OR VANILLYLMANDELIC ACID (VMA). THESE TWO TUMOR MARKERS CAN BE MEASURED ACCURATELY AND PRECISELY BY HIGH-PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY OR GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY, BUT THESE PROCEDURES ARE NOT PRACTICAL FOR DETERMINING HVA AND VMA IN LARGE NUMBERS OF URINE SPECIMENS. THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP A UNIQUE ENZYME IMMUNOASSAY (EIA) METHOD WITH MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES TO DETECT HVA AND VMA. THE TECHNIQUE WILL BE AUTOMATED, COMPUTERIZED, AND COST EFFECTIVE, PERMITTING THE SCREENING OF A LARGE NUMBER OF SPECIMENS. THE EIA METHOD FOR HVA AND VMA WILL BE SPECIFIC AND SENSITIVE ENOUGH TO DETECT MANY NEUROBLASTOMA CASES IN THE EARLY ASYMPTOMATIC STAGES, WHEN THE DISEASE IS TREATABLE AND LIVES CAN BE SAVED.",

THE MOST EFFICIENT SCINTILLATING MATERIALS HAVE BEEN THE INORGANIC CRYSTAL SCINTILLATORS. NAI(TI) HAS BEEN THE MOST WIDELY USED MATERIAL AND HAS LED TO MANY IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES AND APPLICATIONS. HOWEVER, THIS MATERIAL HAS SEVERAL DISADVANTAGES IN THAT IT IS HYGROSCOPIC, HAS A LONG RADIATION LENGTH, AND HAS POOR MECHANICAL PROPERTIES. BISMUTH GERMANATE (BGO) OVERCOMES MOST OF THE SHORTCOMINGS OF NAI(TI) AND HAS A REDUCED \"AFTERGLOW\" AS WELL. RECENTLY,POLYMER SCINTILLATION FIBERS SHOWED THAT FIBERS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE SIZE OF SCINTILLATION DETECTOR SYSTEMS AND CAN RESULT IN MUCH GREATER SPATIAL RESOLUTION. PHASE I WILL DEVELOP SINGLE CRYSTAL FIBERS OF BGO USING A LASER-HEATED PEDESTAL GROWTH TECHNIQUE LICENSED FROM STANFORD UNIVERSITY. THESE FIBERS WILL HAVE MUCH GREATER EFFICIENCIES THAN THE DEMONSTRATEDPOLYMER FIBERS AND WILL HAVE EVEN HIGHER RESOLUTION.

AFTER ROOM-TEMPERATURE STORAGE, THIS MATERIAL WILL BE REHYDRATED IN VITRO WITH A VARIETY OF SOLUTIONS EXPERIMENTALLY, AND CULTURED KERATINOCYTES WILL BE LAYERED ONTO IT TO DETERMINE WHETHER SUPPORT AND ENGRAFTMENT OF THE EPIDERMAL CELLS OCCUR, WITH SUBSEQUENT STRATIFICATION AND DIFFERENTIATION TO FORM AN INTEGRATION OF DERMIS AND EPIDERMIS. HISTOLOGICAL, BIOCHEMICAL, AND IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STUDIES WILL BE UNDERTAKEN TO VERIFY THE REQUIRED STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS AND THE PRELIMINARY DETERMINATION OF THE LACK OF ANTIGENICITY.

FIRST THE ALGORITHMS DETERMINE A SET OF GATEWAYS THAT MINIMIZES THE END-TO-END AVERAGE DELAY BETWEEN THE INTERNET ORIGINDESTINATION PAIRS FOR A GIVEN LEVEL OF OVERHEAD TRAFFIC. SECOND THE COMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY OF THE ALGORITHMS INDICATES THAT THEY CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN REAL-TIME FOR TACTICAL NAVAL ENVIRONMENTS. TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, THESE ARE THE ONLY AVAILABLE GATEWAY LOCATION ALGORITHMS THAT ARE DIRECTLY APPLICABLE TO THE NAVAL PROBLEM. THE MATHEMATICAL MODEL LEADING TO THE ALGORITHMS WILL INCLUDE THE CASES WHERE THE DELAYS ARE MONOTONICALLY INCREASING CONVEX FUNCTIONS OF THE TRAFFICE ON THE LINKS AND THAT THE CAPACITIES OF THE GATEWAYS ARE DESIGN VARIABLES.

WHEREAS THESE POWER LEVELS CAN BE PROVIDED BY COMBINATORIAL SOLID STATE POWER AMPLIFIERS (SSPA'S) COMPRISING 1-2W IMPATT (OR FET) BUILDING BLOCKS AND 8-16 WAY OUTPUT POWER COMBINERS, THE AVERAGE UPLINK BURST DUTY CYCLE OF 0.025 SUGGESTS THAT A PULSED SSPA USING HIGHER PEAK POWER PULSED IMPATT BUILDING BLOCKS CAN RESULT IN A SIMPLER, LOWER COST 30 GHZ TRANSMITTER. ACCORDINGLY, THE PROPOSED PHASE I STUDY PROGRAM WILL INVESTIGATE THE SUITABILITY OF A PULSED IMPATT AMPLIFIER ANDITS ASSOCIATED INTRAPULSE GAIN PHASE BEHAVIOR AND TRANSIENT CHARACTERISTICS TO ACCOMMODATE TDMA TRAFFIC WITHOUT DEGRADATION. IF SUCCESSFUL, A PULSED 30 GHZ IMPATT SSPA DESIGN WILL BE GENERATED WHICH COULD BE THE BASIS OF A PHASE II HARDWARE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM.",

THIS PROJECT WILL DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF A NOVEL UPGRADING METHOD BASED ON A PHOTOCHEMICAL PROCESS. THE INNOVATION INVOLVES A P PHOTO-INITIATED REACTION BETWEEN METHANE AND CHLORINATED METHANES TO PRODUCE HYDROCHLORIC ACID AND HIGHER HCS. THE PHOTOCHEMICAL PATHWAY ALLOWS BOTH SELECTIVITY OF THE REACTION CHANNEL AND THE ABILITY TO INITIATE REACTION AT MODERATE TEMPERATURES, THUS AVOIDING THE SOOTING CHARACTERISTIC OF HIGHER TEMPERATURE THERMAL PROCESSES. IT HAS THE ADDED ADVANTAGE OF CONVERTING VARIOUS CHLORINATED HCS, UBIQUITOUS IN INDUSTRIAL WASTE, INTO USEFUL FUEL. PHASE I WILL BE AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WITH FIVE TASKS: CONSTRUCTION OF A VERSATILE PHOTOCHEMICAL APPARATUS PHOTOLYSIS OF CH3CL + CH4, SOOT STUDIES, PHOTOLYSIS WITH OTHER CHLOROMETHANES, AND IDENTIFICATION OF IMPORTANT PROCESS PARAMETERS.

THIS CAN PRODUCE REGIONS OF PLASMA WHICH MAY DISTORT THE MICROWAVE BEAM PATTERN. THERE ARE MANY VARIABLES, SUCH AS POWER LEVEL, FREQUENCY, PULSE DURATION AND ALTITUDE, WHICH DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT BREAKDOWN CAN TAKE PLACE. ANOTHER KEY VARIABLE IS THE AMBIENT ELECTRON CONCENTRATION, N, IN THE BEAM PATH. THE ELECTRONS ARE PRODUCED BY COSMIC RAY PARTICLES, AND SO N IS A VERY COMPLICATED FUNCTION OF SPACE AND TIME BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF COSMIC RAY STATISTICS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS THEREFORE DESIGNED TO ACCOMPLISH FOUR OBJECTIVES: 1) CALCULATE N BASED ON CURRENT KNOWLEDGE OF COSMIC RAY PARTICLES; 2) CALCULATE BREAKDOWN FIELDS FOR THE REQUIRED VARIABLES; 3) CALCULATE THE EFFECT OF THE RESULTING PLASMAS ON BEAM PATTERNS; AND 4) COMBINE 1), 2), AND 3) TO OBTAIN AN ALGORITHM TO DESCRIBE THE FAR FIELD PATTERNS OF MICROWAVE RADIATION AS A FUNCTION OF THE APPROPRIATE VARIABLES.",

IT PROPOSES A NEW METHOD TO SYNTHESIZE HIGH PURITY BORON POWDER AND ALSO APPLIES ITS PROPRIETARY PROCESS OF COATING BORON WITH MAGNESIUM USING PHYSICAL VAPOR TECHNOLOGY. THE HIGHEST PURITY BORON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR MILITARY AND AEROSPACE USE COMES FROM A WEST GERMAN SUPPLIER. A DOMESTIC SOURCE FOR THIS POTENTIALLY STRATEGIC FEEDSTOCK WOULD BE IN THE STRATEGIC BEST INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES. THE USE OF BORON AS A METAL FUEL COMPONENT IN EXPLOSIVES, SOLID ROCKET PROPELLANTS OR SOLID RAMJET COMBUSTION ENGINES IS INHIBITED BY BORON OXIDE FORMED ON ITS SURFACE. A THIN COAT OF REACTIVE MAGNESIUM METAL ON THE BORON PARTICLES SURFACE WILL ASSIST ITS COMBUSTION PARAMETERS. IN UNDERWATER EXPLOSIVES, THE MAGNESIUM WILL ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO THE FORMATION OF THE GAS BUBBLE WHICH PROVIDES SHOCK AND PRESSURE EFFECTS. THE MAGNESIUM COATED BORON WOULD BE ADDED TO OR PARTIALLY REPLACE THE ALUMINUM FUEL. THE COATING OF BORON WITH MAGNESIUM MAY CREATE A MORE EFFICIENT FUEL THAN BORON/MAGNESIUM POWDER ENERGY MIXTURE. THE REACTIVELY, BURNING RATE AND COMBUSTION OF THE BORON POWDER SHOULD BE IMPROVED BY A THIN PROTECTIVE COATING OF METALLIC MAGNESIUM.",

THE MEASUREMENTS ARE MADE BY FIRST RESOLVING THE DIRECT RETURN FROM THE MISSILE AND THE REFLECTIONS FROM THE OCEAN SURFACE. BECAUSE THE OCEAN SURFACE IS NOT A STATIONARY AND IDEAL MIRROR REFLECTOR, IT WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE TO USE CONVENTIONAL RADAR SIGNAL PROCESSING TO MAKE THESE MEASUREMENTS. HOWEVER, MARK RESOURCES HAS DEVELOPED NEW PROCESSING TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE ESPECIALLY WELL SUITED FOR THIS PROBLEM. THE FIRST EXTENSION TO CONVENTIONAL RADAR SIGNAL PROCESSING IS TARGET MOTION RESOLUTION (TMR) PROCESSING, WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY SLIDING-WINDOW DOPPLER PROCESSING. IT ALLOWS ONE TO STABILIZE TARGET MOTION AND TO RESOLVE INDIVIDUAL SCATTERERS ON THE TARGET. IT IS VERY POWERFUL FOR TRACKING AND IMAGING SIMPLER TARGETS, SUCH AS MISSILES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR SECOND EXTENSION TO RADAR SIGNAL PROCESSING BEGAN EIGHT YEARS AGO UNDER FUNDING BY AIR FORCE WRIGHT AERONAUTICAL LABORATORY (AFWAL) AND LATER DARPA. ALTHOUGH THIS ADAPTIVE SCATTERER MEASUREMENTS (ASM) TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN DIRECTED TOWARDS TARGET IDENTIFICATION, IT IS COMPLETELY GENERAL, SO THAT IT APPLIES TO ALL RADAR PROBLEMS WHERE HIGH RESOLUTION IS INVOLVED, SUCH AS THE SUBJECT OF THIS SOLICITATION.

THIS SYSTEM INVOLVES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF STROMAL CELLS ON A SUSPENDED NYLON FILTRATION SCREEN, THE GROWTH OF STROMAL CELLS TO SUBCONFLUENCE, AND THE INOCULATION OF STROMA WITH FRESH OR CRYOPRESERVED BONE MARROW CELLS. STROMAL ELEMENTS DISTRIBUTE THEMSELVES THROUGHOUT THE MESHWORK, SECRETE MATRIX PROTEINS, AND ESTABLISH AN INTRICATE MICROENVIRONMENTFOR THE SUPPORT OF HEMATOPOIESIS. ACTIVE PRODUCTION OF MYELOID AND ERYTHROID CELLS IS SEEN FOR AT LEAST 12 WEEKS. PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF THIS SYSTEM REVEALS THE ADHERENT ZONE TO BE ACTIVELY PROLIFERATING AND TO CONSIST OF MULTILINEAGE IMMATURE CELLS. THIS ADHERENT LAYER SUPPORTS ACTIVE PROLIFERATION OF CFU-GM, CFU-GEMM, AND ERYTHROID PROGENITOR CELLS, AS INDICATED BY STANDARD METHYLCELLULOSE AND PLASMA CLOT ASSAY SYSTEMS. MULTILINEAGE HEMATOLOGIC EXPRESSION IN ADHERENT AND NONADHERENT ZONES HAS BEEN CONFIRMED BY CYTOFLUOROGRAPHIC ANALYSIS AND STANDARD DIFFERENTIAL COUNTS. THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL NYLON MESH SYSTEM IS A NOVEL IN VITRO METHOD THAT SUPPORTS THE GROWTH OF SEVERAL HEMATOLOGIC LINEAGES CONCURRENTLY AS WELL AS THE PROLIFERATION OF VARIOUS RAT, MONKEY, AND HUMAN BONE MARROW STEM CELLS.",

INTERMETALLICS SUCH AS TI3A1 OFFER A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY FOR IMPROVED HIGH TEMPERATURE PROPERTIES OVER CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART NICKEL BASE SUPERALLOYS AND TITANIUM ALLOYS. HOWEVER, TI3A1 BASE MATERIALS WITH SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED DUCTILITY, STRENGTH, OXIDATION AND CREEP RESISTANCE HAVE NOTBEEN FULLY DEVELOPED. GRAIN REFINING, MICRO-AND MACROALLYING AND REINFORCING OF TI3A1 INTERMETALLICS ARE INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO IMPROVE HIGH TEMPERATURE PROPERTIES OF TI3A1. THIS PROPOSED PROGRAM UTILIZES ARF THERMAL PLASMA TECHNIQUE TO SYNTHESIZE ULTRAFINE (10-50 NM) AND ULTRAPURE TI3A1 POWDERS. THE PRODUCTION MECHANISM IS ALUMINUM REDUCTION OF TITANIUM TETRACHLORIDE IN AN ARGON HIGH TEMPERATURE PLASMA (<126>10000<198>K). MICRO- AND MACROALLOYING OF TI3A1 WILL ALSO BE CARRIED OUT IN THE PLASMA REACTOR SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE SYNTHESIS OF TI3A1 POWDERS. REINFORCED TI3A1 COMPOSITES WILL ALSO BE INVESTIGATED. A TI3A1 BASE ALLOY AND COMPOSITE WITH IMPROVED DUCTILITY AND HIGH TEMPERATURE PROPERTIES WILL RESULT FROM THIS PROPOSED PROGRAM.",

WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A TDNN FOR THE RECOGNITION OF NONSPEECH ACOUSTICAL SIGNALS WHERE THE SOUNDS MAY RUN TOGETHER AND MAY BE IN BACKGROUND NOISE. WHEN TRAINED TO RECOGNIZE PHONEMES, TDNN'S HAVE SHOWN A REMARKABLE ABILITY TO LEARN TO SEGMENT CONNECT PHONEMES. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A GENERAL PROPERTY OF THESE NETWORKS THAT CAN BE USED WITH NON-SPEECH CONNECTED SOUNDS. IF THIS PROVES THAT FOR THE TDNN THAT WE WILL DEVELOP, WE WILL HAVE SOLVED A MAJOR (AND OFTEN INTRACTABLE PROBLEM IN AUTOMATIC SOUND CLASSIFICATION. BACK PROPAGATION NETWORKS FREQUENTLY RECALL EXCESSIVE TRAINING TIMES OR DO NOT CONVERGE AT ALL WHEN THE TRAINING SET IS LARGE AND COMPLEX. A NEW CLASS OF NEURA; NETWORKS CALLED ADAPTIVE TREES THAT REQUIRES NO MULTIPLICATION AND THAT HAS TRAINING CONVERGENCE RATES THAT ARE ONE OR MORE MAGNITUDES GREATER THAN THE RATES OF EQUIVALENT BACK PROPAGATION NETWORKS HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. WE WILL CONSTRUCT AN ADAPTIVE TREE NETWORK THAT ALSO WILL DO SEGMENTATION, BUT WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL ADAPT MUCH FASTER. THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE NETWORKS AND A HUMAN OPERATOR DURING AND AFTER TRAINING WILL BE STUDIED.",

TO INCORPORATE THESE PROBES INTO A WORKABLEAND REPRODUCIBLE ASSAY IN KIT FORM, A SOLUTION HYBRIDIZATIONFORMAT USING TWO PROBES, A RADIOLABELED REPORTER PROBE AND ABIOTINYLATED CAPTURE PROBE, HAS BEEN DEVISED. CLINICAL SAMPLES ARE TREATED WITH GUANIDINE ISOTHIOCYANATE, WHICH SOLUBILIZES BACTERIA AND CELLS, PROTECTS THE RNA FROM DEGRADATION, AND IMPROVES HYBRIDIZATION KINETICS. STREPTAVIDIN-COATED MAGNETIC BEADS ARE USED AS A SOLID PHASETO IMMOBILIZE THE COMPLEXES. A DNA PROBE TEST FOR B.

THERE IS A NEED FOR AN INSTRUMENT THAT MAKES IT EASY TO DIAGNOSE AND TREAT ACCOMMODATIVE DISORDERS. IN A PRELIMINARY STUDY, A PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENT WAS USED TO PROVIDE OSCILLATING ACCOMMODATION TRAINING TO 11 SUBJECTS WHO HAD REDUCED AMPLITUDE OF ACCOMMODATION FOR 7 TO 20 WEEKS. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE AMPLITUDES IN ALL PRE-PRESBYOPIC SUBJECTS INCREASED BY 1 TO 4 DIOPTERS.

AS FREE TISSUE TRANSFER IS NOW BEING DONE ROUTINELY AT INSTITUTIONS WHERE INEXPERIENCED STAFF ARE UNABLE TO ADEQUATELY MONITOR VIABILITY, THE NEED FOR A RELIABLE METHOD TO MONITOR THE PATENCY OF MICROVASCULAR ANASTOMOSES HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY EVIDENT. ACCURATE MONITORING OF BLOOD FLOW DURING AND AFTER SURGERY IS ESSENTIAL, AND EARLY RECOGNITION OF POSTOPERATIVE VESSEL THROMBOSIS IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE IF REEXPLORATION IS TO PROVE SUCCESSFUL. NUMEROUS MONITORING TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED. DIRECT MONITORS OF PERFUSION HAVE PROVEN TO BE OF LITTLE OR NO VALUE. PROBES ARE BULKY, VERY EXPENSIVE, AND REQUIRE GREAT CARE IN POSITIONING AND REMOVAL. INDIRECT MONITORS RATE AHEAD OF THE DIRECT MONITORS DUE TO LOW COST, SIMPLICITY, AND EASE OF PLACEMENT AND REMOVAL. HOWEVER, THESE MONITORS LACK THE NEEDED SPECIFICITY OF THE DIRECT MONITORS FOR MEASURING TISSUE PERFUSION. THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO PRESERVE THE SIMPLICITY AFFORDED BY INDIRECT MONITORING DEVICES, WHILE PROVIDING THE SPECIFICITYFOR TISSUE PERFUSION MEASUREMENT, BY UTILIZING A SELF-CALIBRATING TISSUE PO2/PCO2PROBE, WHICH MANIPULATES THE LOCAL TISSUE GAS CONDITIONS. TISSUE PO2 AND PCO2 ARE MONITORED UNDER ALTERNATING DEPLETING AND NONDEPLETING CONDITIONS. A PHYSIOLOGICALLY BASED MATHEMATICAL RELATIONSHIP RELATES TISSUE PERFUSION TO THE PO2 AND PCO2 MEASUREMENTS.

COLLAGEN, THE MAJOR STRUCTURAL PROTEIN OF TENDONS AND LIGAMENTS HAS BEEN USED EXTENSIVELY AS A SUPPORT FOR CELL GROWTH AND HAS BEEN SHOWN TO ENHANCE FIBROBLAST GROWTH AND, CONSEQUENTLY, IN VIVO COLLAGEN PRODUCTION.

THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY IS TO PREPARE DACRON-COLLAGEN COMPOSITE MATERIALS AND TO USE IN VITRO AND IN VIVO ASSAYS TO DETERMINE THEIR POTENTIAL USE FOR LIGAMENT AND TENDON REPAIR. MATERIAL PREPARATION INVOLVES A NOVEL TECHNIQUE FOR COVALENT BONDING OF COLLAGEN TO THE SURFACE OF DACRON FIBERS, FOLLOWED BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COLLAGEN MATRIX AROUND THE DACRON FIBERS.

GAS SEPARATION MEMBRANES APPEAR TO BE AN ATTRACTIVE NEW TECHNIQUE THAT COULD LEAD TO A BREAKTHROUGH IN TREATMENT COSTS. A NEW MEMBRANE MATERIAL AND METHOD OF MEMBRANE MANUFACTURE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED. THESE HAVE THE REQUIRED SELECTIVITY AND PERMEABILITY TO MAKE SO2 AND NOX REMOVAL FROM FLUE GAS BY MEMBRANES ECONOMICALLY ATTRACTIVE. THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP THIS TECHNOLOGY AND LEAD TO ITS EVALUATION IN A BENCH-SCALE LABORATORY SYSTEM. IN PHASE I POLYMERS WILL BE EVALUATED AS THICK FILMS AND, IN SOME CASES, AS HIGH PERFORMANCES COMPOSITE MEMBRANES. CALCULATIONS WILL BE MADE TO DEFINE THE TARGET MEMBRANE PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS NEEDED TO MAKE A MEMBRANE FLUE GAS PROCESS ECONOMICALLY VIABLE. IN PHASE II THE MEMBRANE PRODUCTION PROCESS WOULD BE OPTIMIZED AND HIGH TEMPERATURE MODULES WOULD BE USED TO DEMONSTRATE THE PROCESS AT THE LABORATORY BENCH SCALE.",

THE THEORETICAL MODEL, BASED ON A VORTEX-DYNAMICS ALGORITHM,TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THAT, IN MANY FLOWS, VORTICITY IS CONCENTRATED IN A SUB-DOMAIN OF THE FLOW FIELD WHICH IS CONSIDERABLY SMALLER THAN THE TOTAL DOMAIN. BY DISCRETIZINGTHE ACTUAL VORTICITY DISTRIBUTION INTO VORTEX ELEMENTS AND THEN FOLLOWING THE EVOLUTION OF THE VORTICITY FIELD, ONE MAY OBTAIN A COMPLETE FLOW DESCRIPTION LIMITED ONLY BY THE ACCURACY OF THE DISCRETIZATION. THIS MODEL, DEVELOPED AT UCI FOR THE INSTABILITY OF A PLANAR LIQUID JET, WILL BE EXTENDED DURING PHASE I TO INVESTIGATE THE DYNAMICS OF TWO CO-FLOWING SHEARING PLANAR LIQUID JETS, AND TWO IMPINGING OPPOSED PLANAR LIQUID JETS. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH DURING PHASE I WILL FOCUS ON THE VALIDATION OF THE NUMERICAL MODEL WITH HOLOGRAPHIC DIAGNOSTICS. IN ADDITION, DATA WILL BE OBTAINED IN SEVERAL IMPINGING JET CONFIGURATIONS. THIS WORK, IF CARRIED THRU PHASE II WILL RESULT IN NUMERICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL TOOLS WHICH WILL LEAD TO MORE EFFICIENT ATOMIZERS, AND A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF ATOMIZATION AND MIXING.",

THE TECHNIQUE IS BASED ON THE DEFLECTION EXPERIENCED BY A LASER BEAM THAT TRAVELS THRU A THERMAL LENS. PHOTOTHERMAL LASER DEFLECTION (PLD) CAN ALSO MEASURE THE CONCENTRATION OF GASEOUS SPECIES SUCH AS NO(X) AND OTHERS. IT THEREFORE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SIMULTANEOUSLY MEASURE THE PARTICLE CONCENTRATION AND VARIOUS POLLUTANTS SIMULTANEOUSLY. IN THE PROPOSED METHOD A PULSED LASER BEAM LOCALLY HEATS THE PARTICLES PRESENT IN THE EXHAUST THUS CHANGING THE INDEX OF REFRACTION OF THE SURROUNDING GAS AND FORMING A THERMAL LENS. A PROBE CW LASER WHICH TRAVELS THRU THE THERMAL LENS WILL BE DEFLECTED ACCORDINGLY. THE AMOUNT OF DEFLECTION IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE LOCAL MASS CONCENTRATION. THE LASER CAN ALSO BE TUNED TO PUMP A GASEOUS SPECIES OF INTEREST THUS FORMING ALSO A THERMAL LENS. SINCE THE HEAT ABSORBED BY THE PARTICLES IS NOT A STRONG FUNCTION OF THEIR SHAPE, PLD CAN WORK WITH PARTICLE CLUSTERS. BOTH MODELING AND EXPERIMENTAL WORK WILL BE CONDUCTED DURING PHASE I TO ESTABLISH THE FEASIBILITY OF THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUE.",

IT WOULD PERMIT USERS TO ACQUIRE, ANALYZE, AND DISPLAY 3-D DATATHAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE MAPPING AND MORPHOMETRY OF NEURONS IN THE CENTRAL AND PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. THE DESIGN CONCEPT IS BASED UPON IMAGE-COMBINING COMPUTER MICROSCOPY. IMAGE DATA ACQUISITION, BASED UPON IMAGE SUPERPOSITION, IS RAPID AND SIMPLE. IT IS ALSO APPLICABLE TO VIDEO MICROSCOPY, AND THE COMBINATION OF THE TWO CAN MATERIALLY ASSIST IN APPLICATIONS INVOLVING BOTH. DESIGN FEATURES TO BE EXPLORED, DEVELOPED, AND TESTED INCLUDE: (1) APPLICABILITY TO A WIDE VARIETY OF PERIPHERALS,INCLUDING COMPUTER-CONTROLLED STAGES, VIDEO ACQUISITION SUBSYSTEMS, POINTERS, DISPLAYS, PRINTERS, AND PLOTTERS, SO THAT NEUROLUCIDA CAN BE USED WITH DIVERSE LABORATORY IMAGINGSYSTEMS; (2) ABILITY TO TRANSFER IMAGE DATA FILES TO EXISTING DATABASE AND SPREADSHEET SOFTWARE FOR INCREASED ANALYTICAL CAPABILITIES; AND (3) METHODS FOR CROSS-REFERENCING VIDEO IMAGE FILES TO COMPUTER GRAPHIC DISPLAY LIST FILES OF THE SAME STRUCTURES.",

SAW MICROELECTRONIC DEVICES CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT ARE AS SMALL AS A FEW SQUARE MILLIMETERS, HAVE RESPONSE TIMES OF ONLY A FEW SECONDS, AND ARE INHERENTLY STABLE AT HIGH TEMPERATURES. MULTIPLE SAW SENSOR ARRAYS, IN WHICH EACH SENSOR HAS A COATING WITH DIFFERENT CHEMICAL SELECTIVITY, COULD BE USED WITH SIMPLE PATTERN RECOGNITION SCHEMES TO MONITOR THE COMPOSITION OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, DETECT CHEMICAL CHANGES IN WASTE STREAMS, OR SIMPLY IDENTIFY SPECIFIC CHEMICAL VAPORS. HOWEVER, CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART SAW CHEMICAL MICROSENSORS ARE LIMITED ESSENTIALLY TO ANALYTICAL MEASUREMENTS AT OR NEAR AMBIENT TEMPERATURE, BECAUSE OF THE CHEMICALLY SELECTIVE ORGANIC COATINGS USED FOR THEIR SPECIFICITY AND SENSITIVITY. THE PRINCIPAL EFFORTS IN PHASE I ARE TO (1) DEVELOP CHEMICALLY SELECTIVE COATINGS BASED ON THE USE OF THERMALLY STABLE MATERIALS TO EXTEND THE NEW SAW TECHNOLOGY TO HIGH TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE APPLICATIONS AND (2) EXPLORE INNOVATIVE SAW DESIGNS TO FURTHER REDUCE DEVICE SIZE AND IMPROVE PERFORMANCE. PHASE II WOULD BE AN ENGINEERING EFFORT TO FABRICATE PROTOTYPE SAW ARRAY SENSORS, INCORPORATING THE NEWLY DEVELOPED COATINGS AND DEVICE DESIGNS, FOR TEST AND EVALUATION IN EXTREME TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE ENVIRONMENTS.",

IT HAS ALREADY BEEN FOUND THAT A COATING OF SILICON OXIDE OR ALUMINUM OXIDE OVER THE KAPTON GREATLY EXTENDS ITS SERVICE LIFE DURING THIS EXPOSURE TO OXYGEN. HOWEVER, THE OXIDE COATINGS ARE BRITTLE AND SUBJECTTO CRACKING. IT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS RESEARCH TO DEVELOP A COATING WITH THE DESIRABLE PROTECTIVE PROPERTIES OF THE EARLIER FILMS, BUT WHICH ARE ALSO MUCH MORE CRACK-RESISTANT. SECONDARILY, IT WOULD ALSO BE DESIRABLE FOR THIS NEW FILM TO BE UV-OPAQUE, SINCE UV RADIATION ALSO CHEMICALLY DEGRADES KAPTON.",

THE AAW FORCE LEVEL ATTRIBUTES/DRIVERS AS DEFINED BY SPAWAR 314, AAW DIVISION OF WARFARE SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE AND ENGINEERING DIRECTORATE, WILL BE ADDRESSED IN TERMS OF THE AAW MISSION SUCCESS CRITERIA AS CITED IN THE AAW TOP LEVEL WARFARE REQUIREMENT DOCUMENTS. THESE AAW FORCE ATTRIBUTES (WARFIGHTING CAPABILITIES) ARE: BATTLE SPACE; BATTLE MANAGEMENT; FIREPOWER, COUNTERMEASURES (CM)/COUNTER-COUNTERMEASURES (CCM); SUSTAINABILITY/ SURVIVABILITY; MOBILITY AND READINESS. THE EFFORT INVOLVES IDENTIFYING THE MODEL INPUTS THAT ADEQUATELY DEFINE THE ARCHITECTURE AND THE THREAT, DEFINING THE MODEL OUTPUTS THAT PROVIDE THE ASSESSMENT OF THE ATTRIBUTES, AND DEVELOPING THE PROPER RELATIONSHIPS TO ENABLE THE COMPUTATION OF THE OUTPUT VALUES FROM THE INPUT DATA. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT CURVES, OBTAINED FROM THE MORE DETAILED MODELS, WILL BE EMPLOYED AND DATA VALUES WILL BE DETERMINED THROUGH INTERPOLATIO/EXTRAPOLATION AS NECESSARY. THE EFFORT INCLUDES DEVELOPING A COMPUTERIZED MODEL THAT WILL BE USER FRIENDLY.",

THE MAB-CTX THUS OBTAINED IS CONJUGATED TO COLLOIDAL GOLD (< 0.45 UM DIAMETER) OR COLORED LATEX PARTICLES. THIS WILL BE THE SPECIFIC DETECTION REAGENT. TOXINS IN FISH SAMPLES WILL BE DETECTED BY TOUCHING THE FISH TISSUE WITH BAMBOO STICK COATED WITH ORGANIC SOLUBLE LIQUID CORRECTION FLUID. THE STICK IS THEN FIXED FOR ONE SECOND IN ABSOLUTE METHYL ALCOHOL, AIR-DRIED, AND IMMERSED IN THE COLORED SUSPENSION OF MAB-CTX COUPLED TO GOLD OR LATEX SUSPENSION. A STICK THAT SHOWS COLOR WITHIN A FEW MINUTES WILL BE CONSIDERED POSITIVE. THE LIQUID PAPER CORRECTION FLUID COAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY EXAMINED IN THE STICK ENZYME IMMUNOASSAY AND APPEARS TO ATTRACT CIGUATOXIN AND RELATED POLYETHERS FROM FISH TISSUES. THE FEATURES OF THIS \"SOL PARTICLE IMMUNOASSAY\" WILL MAKE IT USABLE UNDER VARIOUS CONDITIONS (LABORATORY, ON SHIP WHILE REEF FISHING, OR AT HOME).

IN RESPONSE TO THIS NEED, A SERIES OF RIBONUCLEOTIDE REDUCTASE INHIBITORS, BASED ON A VICINAL POLYHYDROXYPHENYL STRUCTURE, HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED. THE COMPOUND OF THE INITIAL SERIES WITH THE BEST ANTITUMOR ACTIVITY IN ANIMAL TUMOR MODELS, DIDOX, HAS ENTERED HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO ENHANCE THE THERAPEUTIC EFFICACY OF THE ANTICANCER DRUGS, DIDOX AND AMIDOX, BY CONJUGATING THEM TO A BIOCOMPATIBLE POLYMER. IT IS HOPED THAT THE DRUG-POLYMER CONJUGATE WILL REDUCE THE RATE OF DIDOX METABOLISM AND ELIMINATION TO ACHIEVE A LONGERBIOLOGICAL HALF-LIFE. INITIAL HUMAN CLINICAL PHARMACOKINETIC STUDIES INDICATE THAT DIDOX HAS A SHORT HALF-LIFE IN THE PLASMA. DURING PHASE I, DIDOX AND AMIDOX AND THE BIOCOMPATIBLE POLYMER WILL BE PREPARED AND THE DRUG WILL BE ATTACHED DIRECTLY TO THE POLYMER OR THROUGH A DEGRADABLE SPACER GROUP. THE DRUG-POLYMER ADDUCTS WILL BE CHARACTERIZED, AND STUDIES WILL BE PERFORMED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY INHIBIT MAMMALIAN RIBONUCLEOTIDE REDUCTASE BEFORE AND AFTER TREATMENT WITH MICROSOMAL AND LYSOSOMAL ENZYMES. CYTOTOXICITY AGAINST TISSUE CULTURE CELLS WILL BE ASCERTAINED. MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE ANTITUMOR ACTIVITY OF THE DRUG-POLYMER CONJUGATES IN THE L1210 LEUKEMIA AND LEWIS LUNG TUMOR MODELS WILL BE DETERMINED.",

ONE PRESENT LIMITATION IS THE SITE AND COST OF THE TRANSLATOR PROCESSING SYSTEM (TPS) WHICH CONSTRAINS IT TO A FEW GROUND-BASED IN ALLATIONS. THIS LIMITS THE RANGE OF OPERATION OF THE TRANSLATOR BASED TRACKING SYSTEM AND ALSO THE NUMBER OF PARTICICPANTS THAT CAN BE TRACKED. SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS AND COST SAVINGS COULD BE ACHIEVED THROUGH THE USE OF A TRANSLATOR RECORDER OR DATA RELAY LINK. A RECORDER WOULD ALLOW DATA FROM MULTIPLE TRANSLATORS TO BE STORED FOR LATER PROCESSING, THUS INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS THAT CAN BE TRACKED. THE LOW SIZE AND WEIGHT OF THE TRANSLATOR DATA RECORDER AND DATA RELAY LINK ALSO ALLOWS THEM TO BE CARRIED ON BOARD AN AIRCRAFT, WHICH SIGNIFICIANTLY INCREASES THE RANGE OF OPERATION OF THE TRACKING SYSTEM AND PERMITS GROUND-BASED PARTICICPANTS TO BE TRACKED. UNDER THE PHASE I STUDY, THE REQUIREMENTS WILL BE IDENTIFIEDFOR A TRANSLATOR DATA RECORDER AND A DATA RELAY LINK AND A STUDY WILL BE PERFORMED OF EXISTING EQUIPMENT THAT MAY BE ADAPTED FOR THIS PURPOSE.

THESE DETECTORS OPERATE USING THE SAME PHYSICAL PRINCIPLES AS THE LSC. A ONE-HUNDRED-FOLD REDUCTION IN PHOTODEGRADATION OF PLASTIC SCINTILLATORS HAS BEEN ACHIEVED UTILIZING NEW COMBINATIONS OF PLASTICS, DYES, AND THEIR ENVIRONMENT, COMPARED TO PREVIOUS COMBINATIONS. THE DEVELOPMENT WORK WAS DONE USING ONE MILLION VOLT COBALT X-RAYS WHICH COULD RESULT IN EXCITATION OF PLASTIC AND DYES TO ALL POSSIBLE STATES, WHEREAS SOLAR RADIATION WOULD GIVE AN EXCITATION DISTRIBUTION TO A REDUCED SET OF STATES. IT IS, THEREFORE, NOT CLEAR HOW TO TRANSLATE THE IMPROVEMENT FACTOR OF ONE HUNDRED IN PHOTOSTABILITY TO THE CASE OF A LSC. PHASE I OF THIS SBIR AWARD IS TO CONDUCT EXPERIMENTAL MEASUREMENTS OF DEGRADATION RATES FOR THE NEW RADIATION STABLE LUMINESCENT PLASTICS IN SIMULATED AND ACTUAL SOLAR EXPOSURES.

        "abstract": "Abstract         APPLICATIONS OF THE NEW HIGH TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTORS IN ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS REQUIRE THE DEVELOPMENT OF WELL-CONTROLLED TECHNIQUES FOR FABRICATING THIN FILMS OF THEMATERIALS. CONSIDERABLE SUCCESS HAS BEEN OBTAINED WITH PULSED EXCIMER LASER DEPOSITION. THIS METHOD HAS DEMONSTRATED EXCELLENT CONTROL OVER CHEMICAL COMPOSITION AND PHASE. HOWEVER, THE FILMS OFTEN CONTAIN UNWANTED PARTICULATE MATERIAL EJECTED FROM THE SOURCE. MINIMIZING THE NUMBER OF PARTICLES IN THE FILMS IS ESSENTIAL FOR PATTERNING SMALL DEVICE FEATURES AND FABRICATING MULTI-LAYER STRUCTURES WITHOUT PINHOLES OR ELECTRICAL SHORTS. SMOOTH, PARTICLE-FREE SURFACES ALSO ARE REQUIRED TOACHIEVE LOW MICROWAVE LOSSES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF THESE PARTICLES BY DESIGNING AND CONSTRUCTING A VELOCITY FILTER OR SHUTTER MECHANISM THAT WILL BLOCK THE PASSAGE OF THE SLOWER MOVING PARTICLES WHILE ALLOWING THE DESIRED FASTER MOVING VAPOR SPECIES OF THE EVAPORANT TO DEPOSIT ON THE SUBSTRATE. THE PARTICLE- TRAPPING TECHNIQUE WILL BE APPLIED TO THE FILM DEPOSITION OF THE YTTRIUM- BARIUM-COPPER-OXIDE SUPERCONDUCTOR ON SUITABLE SUBSTRATES, E.G., STRONTIUM TITANATE OR LANTHANUM ALUMINATE. PROCESSING CONDITIONS WILL BE OPTIMIZED TO ACHIEVE FILMS WITH LOW PARTICLE CONTENT AND GOOD SUPERCONDUCTING PROPERTIES.",

SUCH IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRE THE ABILITY TO GROW, PROCESS, AND TEST FIBERS AT HIGHER TEMPERATURES THAN PRESENTLY POSSIBLE IN A PRACTICAL MANNER. THIS PROJECT WILL EVALUATE THE TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY OF PRODUCING, ENHANCING, AND TESTING FIBERS USED IN PRODUCTION OF REINFORCED FIBER COMPOSITES BY APPLYING ULTRAHIGH SOLAR FLUX. GENERALLY, IT IS P PREFERABLE TO HEAT SUCH FIBERS RADIANTLY. TO DO SO PRACTICALLY AT TEMPERATURES HIGHER THAN 1,500 DEGREES CENTIGRADE, ULTRAHIGH SOLAR CONCENTRATION WILL BE USED. IN PHASE I, THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING A TWO-STAGE NON-IMAGING OPTICAL SOLAR CONCENTRATION SYSTEM TO REACH TEMPERATURES BETWEEN 1,500 DEGREES CENTIGRADE AND THOSE APPROACHING THE SUN'S SURFACE TEMPERATURE WITHIN A SMALL-DIAMETER CYLINDRICAL HOT-ZONE WILL BE ASSESSED. THE PROCEDURES USED PREVIOUSLY TO DEVELOP NON-IMAGING DESIGNS TOCOUPLE THE NEARLY COLLIMATED SOLAR RADIATION TO A POINT OF ULTRAHIGH SOLAR CONCENTRATION WILL BE EXTENDED TO THE PRESENT CASE. AN ANALOGOUS TWO-STAGE FIBER FURNACE THAT PROPERLY COUPLES THE SOLAR ENERGY TO A CYLINDRICAL LINE OF ULTRAHIGH CONCENTRATION WILL BE DESIGNED. COMPUTER PROGRAMS WILL BE DEVELOPED TO DESIGN AND RAY-TRACE THE NEEDED NON-IMAGING ELEMENT. IN THIS MANNER, A COMPLETE SYSTEM SIMULATION WILL BE MADE IN TERMS OF THE SECONDARY OR NON-IMAGING ELEMENT'S INPUT AND OUTPUT FLUX DISTRIBUTIONS AND DEPENDENCE ON OPTICAL DESIGN PARAMETERS. THE INDICATED PROTOTYPE OPTICAL CONCENTRATION SYSTEM WILL THEN BE CONSTRUCTED SO THAT BRASS-BOARD MEASUREMENTS OF THE RESULTING TEMPERATURE CAN BE MADE. BOTH OPTICAL PYROMETRY AND TUNGSTEN WIRE RESISTANCE METHODS WILL BE USED TO CONFIRMAND CALIBRATE TEMPERATURE. IF THE TECHNICAL MERIT OF HIGH TEMPERATURE FIBER PROCESSING AND TESTING THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF ULTRAHIGH SOLAR ENERGY CONCENTRATION IS DEMONSTRATED, A PHASE II PROGRAM TO BUILD AND TEST A WORKINGPROTOTYPE WILL BE CONDUCTED. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS WILL THENBE USED AND SCALED TO DEVELOP THE DESIGN FOR A PRACTICAL SOLAR FURNACE STATION FOR FIBER PROCESSING AND TESTING.",

THE INITIATIVE FOR THIS WORK STEMS FROM AN IDENTIFIED MARKET. PACIFIC MONOLITHICS HAS TOLD NSI THAT THEY WOULD PURCHASE LARGE QUANTITIES OF THIS TYPE OF PRODUCT, IF AVAILABLE. THE LASER WILL BE OF THE GRADED INDEX SEPARATE CONFINING HETEROSTRUCTURE SINGLE QUANTUM WELL (GRINSCH-SQW) TYPE WHICH HAS PRODUCED THE HIGHEST PERFORMANCE SEMICONDUCTOR LASERS TO DATE. THE TRANSISTOR STRUCTURE WILL BE THE STRAINED CHANNEL. MODULATION DOPED FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTOR (MODFET) TYPE. THIS TYPE MODFET HAS PRODUCED THE WORLD'S FASTEST TRANSISTOR FOR THE PROPOSED GEOMETRY. THE QUANTUM WELL LASER AND TRANSISTOR STRUCTURE WILL BE GROWN BY MOLECULAR BEAM EPITAXY (MBE) AND SCALED UP TO 3 INCH DIAMETER SUBSTRATES ON NSI'S DUAL CHAMBER MBE MACHINES FOR MASS PRODUCTION (COST REDUCTION). THESE INDIVIDUAL DEVICES AND MATERIALS, AS WELL AS THE GROWTH AND FABRICATION TECHNOLOGIES, HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED AT CORNELL UNIVERSITY. PHASE I OF THIS PROGRAM WOULD EXTEND THIS KNOWLEDGE TO INCLUDE THE INTEGRATION TECHNOLOGY. THIS IS A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR CONFIEDENCE IN FUTURE MANUFACTURABILITY. THE LASING WAVELENGTH WILL BE APPROXIMATELY 850 NM, SUITABLE FOR SHORT HAUL PLASTIC OR MULTIMODE GLASS FIBERS (LOCAL AREA) OPTICAL SIGNAL TRANSMISSION. IN THE FUTURE, THIS TECHNOLOGY WOULD LEAD ON TO OPTICAL NETWORKING.",

WHAT IS PROPOSED HERE IS AN INNOVATIVE METHOD OF RAPID MULTI-GAS ANALYSIS WHICH WILL LEAD TO A RUGGED AND COMPACT RESPIRATORY MONITOR. OUR TECHNIQUE IS BASED ON THE MEASUREMENT OF THE INTENSITY OF THE EMISSION OF SELECTED SPECTRAL LINES FROM A GLOW DISCHARGE. THE TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE TO DEVELOP A SUITABLE GLOW DISCHARGE TUBE AND TO BUILD AND TEST A PROTOTYPE GAS ANALYZER WITH THIS DISCHARGE TUBE AS ITS BASIC TRANSDUCER. THE DISCHARGE TUBE DESIGNS WILL INCLUDE VARIOUS GEOMETRIES AND CATHODE MATERIALS SELECTED TO MINIMIZE CATHODE SPUTTERING. THE TESTING OF THE COMPLETE PROTOTYPE ANALYZER WILL INCLUDE MEASUREMENT OF RANGE, LINEARITY, SIGNAL STRENGTH, NOISE, REPEATABILITY, AND RESPONSE TIME. IN PHASEII, THE ADDITION OF A FLOW MODULE AND DISPLAY MONITOR, ALONGWITH APPROPRIATE MINIATURIZATION, WILL LEAD TO A COMPLETE AND COMPACT RESPIRATORY MONITORING PACKAGE. IN ADDITION TO ITS USE IN THE SPACE STATION, THE POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS OF THIS ANALYZER INCLUDE HOSPITAL BEDSIDE MONITORING, MOBILE STRESS AND EXERCISE TESTING, ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING, AND PROCESS CONTROL.",

ONE OF THE PROGRAMS WILL BE BASED ON RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN RECURSIVE PARTITIONING FOR PATTERN CLASSIFICATION. THE OTHER PROGRAM WILL BE DEVELOPED USING AN EXPERT SYSTEM SHELL AND CRITERIA TABLES THAT WILL ALLOW CONSIDERABLE FLEXIBILITY IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PRODUCTION RULES.

IN SOME ANIMAL DISEASE MODELS, THERE APPEARS IN VASCULAR SMOOTH MUSCLE A DIFFERENT RECEPTOR ON WHICH DES-ARG(9)-BK IS AN AGONIST. EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT INTERLEUKIN-1 (IL-1) IS RESPONSIBLE FOR INDUCING THESE B1 RECEPTORS. SIMILARLY, IN SEVERAL MODELS OF HUMAN PATHOLOGY AND IN TISSUE FROM PATIENTS WITH DISEASES THOUGHT TO BE MEDIATED BY OVERPRODUCTION OF IL-1, BK RESPONSIVENESS IS DRAMATICALLY INCREASED. MOREOVER, IF HEALTHY TISSUE IS TREATED WITH IL-1, RESPONSES TO BK INCREASE. THUR, IL-1 SENSITIZES TISSUES TO THE ACTIONOF BK AND MAY DO SO THROUGH INDUCTION OF B1 RECEPTORS. BK ANTAGONISTS BASED ON SCREENS OF B2 RECEPTORS ARE CURRENTLY BEING DEVELOPED. THE B1 RECEPTOR, HOWEVER, MAY BE MORE IMPORTANT IN SEVERAL INFLAMMATORY DISEASES. ANOTHER POTENTIALLY VERY IMPORTANT APPROACH MAY BE DEVELOPMENT OF AN IL-1 INHIBITOR TO TREAT INFLAMMATORY DISEASES.

THE COLLISION AVOIDANCE ALGORITHM WILL CONSIST OF TWO SUBSIDIARY ALGORITHMS: THE COLLISION FEASIBILITY ALGORITHM AND THE COLLISION DETECTION ALGORITHM.

THE NEED FOR THIS TYPE OF IMAGING SYSTEM WAS IDENTIFIED DURING THE COURSE OF A PREVIOUS STUDY TO DEVELOP INFLATABLE END EFFECTORS FOR HANDLING DELICATE COMPOSITE STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS. ONE OF THE INFLATABLE END EFFECTOR TOOLS DEVELOPED SHOWS PROMISE FOR THE ADDITION OF A CENTERLINE IMAGING SYSTEM WITH MINIMUM REDESIGN OF THE END EFFECTOR TOOL. THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL DESIGN A CENTERLINE IMAGING SYSTEM FOR THAT END EFFECTOR TOOL, FABRICATE A PROTOTYPE OF THE END EFFECTOR TOOL WITH THE CENTERLINE IMAGING SYSTEM, AND PARTICIPATE IN THE TESTING OF THE SYSTEMAT NASA-MSFC. AS THE EXISTING END EFFECTOR TOOL HAS BEEN DESIGNED FOR USE WITH THE P-FMA SYSTEM AT NASA-MSFC, IT IS PROPOSED THAT TESTING BE PERFORMED AT THAT FACILITY TO MINIMIZE COST OF THE PROJECT.",

THE ANALYSIS OF CELLULAR DNA FOR ONCOGENIC SEGMENTS, LATENT VIRUSES, POLYMORPHISMS, GENE AMPLIFICATION, AND REARRANGEMENTS HAS PERMITTED RESEARCHERS TO ESTABLISH MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN EVENTS AT THE DNA AND RNA LEVEL AND VARIOUS DISEASE STATES. THE MOST SENSITIVE METHOD FOR THE DETECTION OF THESE EVENTS IS USING RADIOLABELED NUCLEIC ACID PROBES COUPLED WITH AUTORADIOGRAPHY. IF DNA ANALYSIS IS TO BECOME ROUTINELY USED IN THE CLINICAL LABORATORY, SENSITIVE NONRADIOACTIVE DETECTION METHODS MUST BE DEVELOPED. IN THIS RESEARCH, IT IS PLANNED TO DEVELOP A NOVEL PROCEDUREFOR THE DETECTION OF HYBRIDIZED NUCLEIC ACID PROBES. THIS PROCEDURE INCLUDES SEVERAL STEPS: (1) SOUTHERN OR NORTHERN HYBRIDIZATION PROCEDURES USING PROBES DERIVATIZED WITH ALKYL HALIDE GROUPS; (2) COVALENT ATTACHMENT OF DEXTROSE POLYMERS CARRYING MULTIPLE ZINC-EDTA COMPLEXES TO THE ALKYL HALIDE GROUPS OF THE MODIFIED PROBES; AND (3) THE RELEASE OF ZINC IONS TO REACTIVATE INACTIVE ZINC-FREE ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE CONTAINED IN AGAROSE GELS THAT ARE PLACED OVER THE MEMBRANE. SUBSEQUENTLY, COLOR WILL BE DEVELOPED IN THE AGAROSE GELS RATHER THAN ON THE MEMBRANE.",

OPTECH HAS CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF A NUMBER OF FIBER-OPTIC SENSORS FOR USE IN GEOPHYSICAL (E.G. BOREHOLE DEPLOYMENT OR UNDERWATER STREAMERS), MILITARY, AND INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS. THE PROPOSED GRAVIMETER OFFERS THE FOLLOWING ADVANTAGES: HIGH SENSITIVITY (-0.2 MICROGAL); LOW COST; MINIATURE SENSING ELEMENT (<65 CC PHASE II)(CYLINDER 5.7 CM, DIAMETER X 2.5CM HIGH (EXCLUSIVE OF ELECTRONICS)); LIGHT WEIGHT; EMI/EMP (SURGE) IMMUNITY; AND TOTAL FIELD CAPABILITY (NOT IN PHASES I OR II). THIS DEVICE IS CAPABLE OF BEING OPERATED IN BOREHOLE, AEROSPACE, LAND, AND UNDERSEA ENVIRONMENTS, AND WILL BE AN IMPROVEMENT OVER PRESENT GRAVIMETERS. THE LATTERGENERALLY HAVE VERY COMPLEX, DELICATE AND EXPENSIVE SUSPENSION SYSTEMS WHICH ARE REQUIRED TO DEVELOP SUFFICIENT DISPLACEMENT TO ACHIEVE THE REQUIRED SENSITIVITY. THIS IMPOSES SEVERE LIMITATIONS ON OPERATIONAL ORIENTATION. FURTHERMORE, MODERN GRAVIMETERS SUFFER FROM TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE SENSITIVITY AND LONG SETTLING TIME DUE TO THIS SUSPENSION SYSTEM. THE INHERENT MECHANICAL SIMPLICITY AND BALANCED MECHANICAL DESIGN OF THE PROPOSED FIBER-OPTIC GRAVIMETER IS EXPECTED TO OVERCOME THESE PROBLEMS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME BEING CAPABLE OF SUB-MICROGAL SENSITIVITY.",

TOGETHER, A PROCESSOR INCORPORATING THESE DEIVCES WILL ULTIMATELY BE CAPABLE OF PROCESSING AN ARRAY OF 4X10(5) INPUT PIXELS WITH A SINGLE RECONFIGURABLE FAN-OUT OR 200X200 PIXELS WITH A FAN-OUT OF UP TO 10(4X10(5) INTERCONNECTS) AT A FRAME RATE OF GREATER THAN 30HZ. THE PHASE I PROGRAM SEEKS TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF THE MASSIVE HOLOGRAM ARRAY THROUGH THE OPTICAL CONSTRUCTION OF A NUMBER OF EXPERIMENTAL ARRAYS WITH SIZES OF UP TO 15X15 PIXELS, SINGLE PIXEL FAN-OUT OF UP TO 3, AND SUBHOLOGRAM DIMENSIONS AS SMALL AS 500 UM. DEVICE OPERATION WILL BE DEMONSTRATED IN A SIMPLIFIED PROCESSOR USING COMPONENTS AVAILABLE AT OPTRON. COMPUTER GENERATION OF MASSIVE ARRAYS WILL ALSO BE EXPLORED. IF SUCCESSFUL, OPTRON PROPOSES TO CONTINUE DEVELOPMENT IN PHASE II WITH THE CONSTRUCTION OF HFFDS OF ARRAY SIZE UP TO 350X350 WITH SINGLE PIXEL A FAN-OUT OF UP TO 10, AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A RECONFIGURABLE OPTICAL PROCESSOR CAPABLE OF HANDLING A 50X50 INPUT ARRAY WITH FAN-OUT OF 10.",

THE DEVICE INCORPORATES A HIGH RESOLUTION ELECTRON GUN CAPABLE OF 36 CYCLES/MM, WHOSE BEAM IS AMPLIFIED BY AN OPTRON SYSTEMS PROPRIETARY DEVICE CALLED A POWER MICROCHANNEL PLATE (PMCP). AN INNOVATIVE FEATURE OF THE DESIGN IS THE INCORPORATION OF A HIGH RESOLUTION CHARGE-TRANSFER PLATE (CTP) TO TRANSFER CHARGE FROM THE INSIDE TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE EVACUATED ELECTRON-GUN ASSEMBLY. THE CTP IS INTEGRAL WITH THE LIQUID-CRYSTAL CELL AND SERVES AS A PROGRAMMABLE ELECTRODE ARRAY. PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS TO BE INVESTIGATED INCLUDE: SPATIAL RESOLUTION, FRAMING SPEED, CONTRAST RATIO, AND SPATIAL UNIFORMITY. THE PROPOSED PROGRAM WILL INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY OF A NEW TYPE SPATIAL LIGHT MODULATOR THAT IS: 1) POTENTIALLY MUCH MORE RELIABLE AND LESS COSTLY THAN EXISTING SLM'S, 2) SCALABLE TO ACTIVE AREAS UP TO 50MM IN DIAMETER, 3) CAPABLE OF FAST FRAMING SPEEDS, 4) ABLE TO SERVE AS A PRECISE, PROGRAMMING HIGH-SPEED, BINARY FOURIER FILTER, AND, 6) EASILY CONTROLLED WITH A PERSONAL COMPUTER. PROPRIETARY OPTRON TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN EMPLOYED TO OPTIMIZE PERFORMANCE AND REDUCE THE COST OF THE DESIGN. THE PHASE II TASKS WILL INCLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN OPTIMIZED E-FLCM AND A COMPATIBLE COMPUTER CONTROL SYSTEM.",

COAL BENEFICIATION BY SELECTIVE AGGLOMERATION OF MOST RAW COALS HAS DEMONSTRATED THE REMOVAL OF OVER 95% OF THE MINERAL MATTER, INCLUDING PYRITIC SULFUR, WHILE RECOVERING VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE COAL FED TO THE PROCESS. THE EVENTUAL APPLICATION OF THIS PROCESS--TO REFINE COAL FOR USE IN ELECTRICAL POWER PRODUCTION AND, IN THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR, FOR STEAM GENERATION--WILL CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE REDUCTION OF BOTH \"ACID RAIN\" AND MAINTENANCE COSTS. MOST OF THE KEY VARIABLES THAT CONTROL THE SEPARATION UNIT PROCESS HAVE BEENDEFINED AND REPORTED IN TERMS OF BATCH BENCH SCALE PROCEDURES. THOSE VARIABLES INCLUDE AGGLOMERATION KINETICS,THE COAL/WATER/AGGLOMERATION RATIO, AND THE HIGH SHEAR MIXING. HOWEVER, PROCESS ECONOMICS REQUIRES RELIABLE CONTINUOUS PROCESSING THAT TO THIS POINT HAS NOT BEEN PROVIDED WITH A DETAILED INVESTIGATION. THIS INVESTIGATION WILL BE CARRIED OUT IN PHASE I. THE GOAL WILL BE ACHIEVED USING A 20 G/MIN CONTINUOUS SELECTIVE AGGLOMERATION APPARATUS IN WHICH EACH OF THE VARIABLES CAN BE CONTROLLED PRECISELY, AND THE PRODUCT COAL AGGLOMERATES AND MINERAL MATTER CAN BE RECOVERED FOR ANALYSIS. AN ANALYSIS OF THE PRODUCTS UNDER CAREFULLY CONTROLLED CONDITIONS WILL PERMIT ADETAILED DEFINITION OF THE PROCESS IN ENGINEERING TERMS AND VARIABLES. THIS WILL AID IN DETERMINING OPTIMUM DESIGN COSTESTIMATES AND SCALE-UPS.",

BECAUSE OF INTERPROCESSOR COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS, HOWEVER, THE ULTIMATE SPEED AT WHICH PROBLEMS CAN BE SOLVED IS LIMITED.

USING THIS METHOD, A LARGE NUMBER OF LOW COST PROCESSORS OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY CAN SOLVE PROBLEMS OF ANY COMPLEX GEOMETRY EXTREMELY EFFECTIVELY. THIS PROPOSAL WILL STUDY AND COMPARE THE MONTECARLO TECHNIQUE AGAINST STANDARD TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS FINITE DIFFERENCE AND FINITE ELEMENT METHODS TO DETERMINE THE POSSIBLE LONG RANGE MERIT IN INVESTING IN PROCESSOR HARDWAREFOR THE MODELER. A PROTOTYPE MODELER BUILT USING LOW COST TRANSPUTERS WILL BE DEVELOPED. IF THE STUDY VERIFIES THE MERIT IN THE MONTE CARLO METHOD, IT WOULD HAVE NEW IMPLICATIONS FOR PROBLEM SOLVING USING FUTURE HARDWARE: AN INVESTMENT IN MASSIVE INEXPENSIVE PROCESSORS, RATHER THAN EXPENSIVE INTERCONNECTED MACHINES, COULD BE OF ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE IN SOLVING A LARGE CLASS OF PROBLEMS IN FIELD THEORY, WEATHER, NUCLEAR SCIENCE, THERMODYNAMICS AND OTHER AREAS.",

THREE APPROACHES TO JOINING SAPPHIRE TO ALUMINA WILL BE EXPLORED: 1) SOLID-STATE OR DIRECT JOINING, 2) USE OF A METALLIC (NB OR PT OR THEIR ALLOYS) INTERLAYER, AND 3) JOINING WITH A DEVITRIFIABLE GLASS. BOND STRENGTH, VACUUM TIGHTNESS, THERMOCHEMICAL COMPATIBILITY (OF THE BOND) WITH COPPER, AND RESISTANCE TO FAILURE DURING THERMAL CYCLING UP TO 1500 DEG C WILL BE EVALUATED AND WILL INDICATE THE RELATIVE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE THREE APPROACHES. THIS INFORMATION, IN CONJUNCTION WITH AN ASSESSMENT OF THE RELATIVE EASE OF APPLYING THESE TECHNIQUES TO (LARGER-SCALE) COPPER VAPOR LASER SYSTEMS, WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE AND PRIORITIZE THE RESEARCH APPROACHES TO BE USED DURING PHASE II. PHASE II WORK WOULD FOCUS ON FABRICATION AND EVALUATION OF SEALED TUBES. SINCE LONG-TERM CONTAINMENT OF COPPER VAPOR AND SUSTAINED LASER OPERATION ARE THE GOALS OF SEALED-TUBE TECHNOLOGY, PHASE II RESEARCH WOULD ALSO ADDRESS THE CRITICAL ISSUES OF LONG-TERM MICROSTRUCTURAL, THERMOMECHANICAL AND THERMOCHEMICAL STABILITY.",

THE CODE WILL BE CAPABLE OF MODELING COMPLEX THREE-DIMENSIONAL FLOW AND HEAT TRANSFER AND WILL BE GENERAL ENOUGH SO AS TO BE USED IN A WIDE VARIETY OF PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH AIRCRAFT PROPULSION, E.G., VSTOLV. THE SOFTWARE WILL BE BASED ON CREARE'S FLUID FLOW MODELING CODE FLUENT/BFC. IN PHASE I, WE WILL DEVELOP THE SPECIFICATIONS FOR THE ENHANCEMENTS TO BE ADDED TO THE PROPOSED CODE. TO DEMONSTRATE THE CURRENT CAPABILITIES OF FLUENT/BFC, WE WILL COMPUTE THE THREEDIMENSIONAL TURBULENT FLOW IN A TYPICAL VENTRAL NOZZLE CONFIGURATION. FINALLY, TO MEET THE SPECIFICATIONS, WE WILL DEVELOP A PLAN FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW FEATURES AND CAPABILITIES THAT ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN THE BASE CODE.",

DUE TO THE INHERENTLY MODERATE STRENGTH AND STIFFNESS TO WEIGHT RATIOS AFFORDED BY ALUMINUM, RELATIVELY THICK TORPEDO HULL SECTIONS ARE REQUIRED TO WITHSTAND THE HYDRODYNAMIC LOADS ENCOUNTERED DURING DEEP DEPTH OPERATIONS AS WELL AS THE DYNAMIC LOADS ENCOUNTERED DURING SURFACE TESTING. CONSEQUENTLY, THE MAJORITY OF THE TORPEDO WEIGHT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE HULL, THEREBY SEVERELY LIMITING THE INTERNAL PAYLOAD, INCLUDING BATTERIES, MOTOR, AND ORDNANCE THAT CAN BE PACKAGED ONBOARD. IN AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE OVERALL TORPEDO CAPABILITY, IT IS DESIRABLE TO REDUCE THE HULL SECTION WEIGHT. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, REQUIRES FABRICATING TORPEDO HULLS FROM ALTERNATE MATERIALS EXHIBITING MUCH GREATER STRENGTH AND STIFFNESS TO WEIGHT RATIOS. HOWEVER, THESE ALTERNATE MATERIALS MUST ALSO BE CAPABLE OF ACCOMMODATING A SEGEMENTED HULL CONSTRUCTION WITH PENETRATORS AND BE COST COMPETITIVE WITH EXISTING ALUMINUM ALLOYS PRESENTLY IN USE. SILICO-CARBIDE PARTICULATE REINFORCED ALUMINUM METAL MATRIX COMPOSITES AFFORD EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH STRENGTH AND STIFFNESS TO WEIGHT RATIOS AT A VERY AFFORDABLE PRICE WHILE STILL MAINTAINING MANY OF THE DESIRABLE MANUFACTURING CHARACTERISTICS OF ALUMINUM. FOR THIS REASON,SILICON-CARBIDE REINFORCED ALUMINUM APPEARS TO BE AN EXCELLENT MATERIAL FOR FABRICATING HIGH STRENGTH, LIGHT WEIGHT TORPEDO HULL SECTIONS. THE PROPOSED EFFORT PRESENTED HERE WILL ATTEMPT TO MAKE A PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF THE FEASIBILITY OF USING SILICON-CARBIDE REINFORCED ALUMINUM IN TORPEDO HULL SECTIONS. THIS EFFORT WILL ENTAILBOTH A PRELIMINARY CHARACTERIZATION OF MATERIAL PROPERTIES AS WELL AS AN ESTIMATE OF THE POTENTIAL WEIGHT SAVINGS ACHIEVABLE WITH A SILICON-CARBIDE ALUMINUM METAL MATRIX COMPOSITE.",

ITS INNOVATIVE BIT-SERIALINTERPROCESSOR I/O STRUCTURE MAKES IT AN IDEAL CANDIDATE FORFINE-GRAIN SYSTOLIC ARRAY APPLICATIONS. THE FINAL RESULT SHOULD BE A SYSTEM WHICH ACHIEVES THE TARGET 10(7-8) MFLOP PER CHIP COMPUTATIONAL BANDWIDTH IN A SMALL, LOW COST PACKAGE.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED WORK IS TO DEVELOP A SIMPLE, LOW-COST DEVICE AND METHODOLOGY WHICH WILL ALLOW THE PRODUCER TO RECOGNIZE WHEN THE CONCENTRATION OF AMMONIA BECOMES DANGEROUS AND THEN EITHER AERATE THE AGH OR USE OTHER MEANS TO PURIFY IN THE AIR. WE HAVE DEVELOPED FOR THEU.S. DOE AND FOR THE U.S. AIR FORCE THIN-CARDS, THE SIZE OF A CREDIT CARD, WHICH CHANGE COLOR WHEN EXPOSED TO AROMATIC AMINES AND TO WARFARE GASES, RESPECTIVELY. WE HAVE SINCE EXAMINED THE FEASIBILITY OF MAKING A SIMILAR CARD WHICH CHANGES ITS COLOR IN A QUANTITATIVE MANNER WHEN EXPOSED TO AMMONIA. THE PRELIMINARY RESULTS WERE VERY SUCCESSFUL, AS DESCRIBED BELOW. THE MAIN OBJECTIVES OF THE PROPOSED WORK ARE: (1) TO IMPROVE OUR AMMONIA DETECTION WAFER SO THAT IT WILL GIVE CONSISTENT QUANTITIVE DATA, REGARDLESS OF THE RELATIVE HUMIDITY, THE AIR VELOCITY AND/OR OTHER GASEOUS IMPURITIES, AS THESE APPEAR TO BE THE DIFFICULTIES WITH EXISTING AMMONIA-DETECTING DEVICES; (2) TO CONDUCT AN ACTUAL TEST IN A CHICKEN GROWING HOUSE (CGH) WHEREBY THE IMPACT OF PROPER AMMONIA LEVEL CONTROL USING OUR AMMONIA WAFERS WILL BE EVALUATED. THIS PART OF THE WORK WILL BE COORDINATED BY PROFESSOR J. BRAKE OF THE POULTRY SCIENCE DEPT. AND BY PROFESSOR HARRIS, FORMERLY OF AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION, BOTH OF N.C. STATE UNIVERSITY, AND WILL BE DONE IN TWO ADJACENT CGH'S OWNED AND OPERATED BY PERDUE INC. (A MAJOR POULTRY COMPANY); AND (3) TO DEVELOP AN ELECTRONIC DETECTOR FOR AMMONIA WHICH CAN REDUCE THE AMMONIA CONCENTRATION AND TRIGGER AIR VENTILATION AND/OR AN AIR PURIFIER, AS NEEDED. THIS PART OF THE WORK WILL BE BASED ON WORK THAT WE ARE PRESENTLY CONDUCTING ON AUTOMATIC AIR CLEANING AND VENTILATION OF CONFINED AREAS, E.G., SUBMARINES.",

THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL ENABLE PERMEABLE CONTACT LENSES, INC., TO CREATE A BIOCOMPATIBLE, RIGID GAS-PERMEABLE CONTACT LENS WITH: (1) IMPROVED OXYGEN PERMEABILITY, (2) ENHANCED WETTINGANGLE, AND (3) A NONREACTIVE SURFACE. THE MATERIAL CREATED WILL GREATLY REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE RISK OF EYE IRRITATION, ABRASION, AND INFECTION BY ALLOWING OXYGEN TO REACH THE EYE, REDUCING DEPOSITS ON THE LENS, AND INCREASING LUBRICATION (WETTING). UNIQUE BLOCK COPOLYMERS WILL BE SYNTHESIZED BY THE GROUP TRANSFER TECHNIQUE. THIS TECHNIQUE ALLOWS POLYMERS TO BE MADE WITH PROPERTIES THAT WERE FORMERLY MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE, PERMEABILITY, WETTABILITY, AND NEUTRALLY CHARGED SURFACE, WHILE RETAINING THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES REQUIRED FOR CORRECTIVE REFRACTIVE INDEX, OPTICAL TRANSPARENCY, AND DIMENSIONAL STABILITY.",

IN FACT, IT CAN BE SHOWN THAT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETECT THESE MINES FROM THE PLATFORM AT OPERATIONAL RANGES. THIS PROJECT PROVIDES A SUBMARINE-TETHERED REMOTE OPERATED VEHICLE (ROV) THAT WILL OPERATE FORWARD OF A TRANSITING SUBMARINE AND PROVIDE MINE DETECTION AND CLASSIFICATION INFORMATION TO THE SUBMARINE SO THAT IT CAN BE MANEUVERED SAFELY THROUGH A MINEFIELD. THIS IS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THE MINE DETECTION SENSORS ARE DEPLOYED SUFFICIENTLY IN FRONT OF THE SUBMARINE THAT THE REQUIRED OPERATIONAL RANGE CAN BE MET. PHASE I OF THIS PROJECT PROVIDES A CONCEPT DESIGN FOR A SUBMARINE-TETHERED ROV SYSTEM THAT IS OPERATED FROM AND RETURNS TO THE HOST SUBMARINE.

THE BWDM ALLOWS MULTIPLE OPTICAL COMMUNICATION CHANNELS IN A SPECIFIC FIBER TRANSMISSION WINDOW TO BE SENT OVER A SINGLE FIBER, THUS ENABLIG DIFFERENT COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS TO BE ENCODED BY WAVELENGTH AND TRANSMITTED OVER THE SAME PHYSICAL NETWORK CARRIER. SUBCARRIER MULTIPLEXING WILL BE USED TO PROVIDE A METHOD FOR ALLOCATING VOICE CHANNELS TO THE NETWORK. WHILE THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN DEVELOPED FOR TELECOMMUNICATION APPLICATIONS BY GTE CORPORATION, PHOENIX DIGITAL HAS RECEIVED A LICENSE TO APPLY THIS ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TO MILITARY LAN COMMUNICATIONS. THE PROJECT OBJECTIVES WILL BE TO SPECIFY, DESIGN AND BUILD A WORKING PROTOTYPE MODEL OF AN OPTICAL LAN TO DEMONSTRATE HOW ADMINISTRATIVE VOICE, TACTICAL VOICE, AND CONTROL/DATA CAN BE ENCODED AND COMMUNICATED OVER MULTIPLE OPTICAL WAVELENGTHS IN A SINGLE OPTICAL CONDUCTOR. NEW, HEURISTIC TECHNIQUES FOR PROVIDING HIGH SPEED COMMUNICAITON WRAPBACK FAULT TOLERANCE WILL ALSO BE INCLUDED IN THE DEMONSTRATION.

RECENT RESEARCH WITH THE NEW CLASS OF HIGH TEMPERATURE CERAMIC SUPERCONDUCTORS AND WITH EDDY CURRENT DISPLACEMENT GAUGES HAS PROVIDED A NEW APPROACH TO THESE VIBRATION DETECTORS. THE MEISSNER EFFECT CAN BE USED TO LEVITATE SMALL MAGNETS ABOVE A SPECIALLY SHAPED SUPERCONDUCTOR (SUCH AS YBA(2)CU(2)O(6.5) AT 77 DEG K) AND AN EDDY CURRENT DEVICE CAN BE USED TO DETECT THE MOTION OF THIS MAGNET IN RESPONSE TO DISTURBANCES. BECAUSE THE LEVITATION IS ESSENTIALLY \"FRICTIONLESS\", AND BECAUSE EQUILIBRATION SHOULD BE VERY RAPID, DRIFT MIGHT BE ALMOST NONEXISTENT IN SUCH INSTRUMENTS. PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS INDICATE THAT SUCH SYSTEMS SHOULD BE LOW COST, VERY RUGGED DURING TRANSPORT AND SETUP, AND HAVE SUFFICIENT BANDWIDTH, DYNAMIC RANGE AND SENSITIVITY TO COMPETE FAVORABLY WITH CONVENTIONAL DETECTORS. THE ADVENT OF SUCH ULTRASENSITIVE DEVICES COULD GREATLY FACILITATE MONITORING OF LOW FREQUENCY VIBRATION, PERHAPS FORMING THE NUCLEUS OF A VERY SENSITIVE DRY SIDE SONAR DETECTION SYSTEM.",

THE AVAILABILITY OF THESE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE PACKAGES WILL ALLOW NEURAL NETWORK RESEARCH AND PROTOTYPING TO BE DONE MORE RAPIDLY AND ALLOW RESEARCHERS TO CONCENTRATE ON HOW TO USE NEURAL NETWORKS RATHER THAN HOW TO CODE A SIMULATION. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE PHASE I EFFORT IS THE DETERMINATION OF THE MATURITY OF CURRENTLY AVAILABLE COMMERCIAL NEURAL NETWORK SOFTWARE TOOLS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PLAN FOR USING THESE TOOLS IN CONJUNCTION WITH AVAILABLE EXPERT SYSTEM SOFTWARE. SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL SURVEY AND EVALUATE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE COMMERCIAL NEURAL NETWORK SOFTWARE SIMULATION PACKAGES, SELECT NEURAL NETWORK PACKAGES FOR EVALUATION, CHOOSE THREE NAVAL APPLICATIONS FOR SOLUTION BY A NEURAL NETWORK/EXPERT SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT, AND, FINALLY, SPECIFY THE STEPS NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT EACH APPLICATION USING NEURAL NETWORK AND EXPERT SYSTEM SOFTWARE.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         THIS PROJECT INVOLVES A NOVEL APPROACH TO PULSED ELECTRON BEAM (E-BEAM) EVAPORATION IN THE PRESENCE OF AN OXYGEN PLASMA FOR THE DEPOSITION OF HIGH TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTING (HTS) THIN FILMS. RECENTLY REPORTED WORK SHOWED THAT SMOOTHER THIN FILMS OF YBA2CU3OX CAN VE DEPOSITED USING PULSED LASER EVAPORATION. INDEPENDENT WORK USING MOLECULAR BEAM EPITAXY TECHNIQUES DEMONSTRATED THAT THE PRESENCE OF ATOMIC OXYGEN IN SITU DURING FILM DEPOSITIONIS ONE KEY TO LOWERING THE REQUIRED SUBSTRATE AND ANNEAL TEMPERATURES FROM THE 850 DEGREES TO 900 DEGREES CENTIGRADE RANGE. THIS PROJECT ADOPTS A NOVEL APPROACH. IT WILL USE APULSED E-BEAM THAT IS ALREADY OPERATIONAL AND HAS 75 KV BEAMENERGY, UP TO 1,000 A CURRENT, AND 1 US PULSE WIDTH (WITH BEAM DIAMETER ON TARGET OF UNDER 1 CM YIELDING ABOUT 100 J/CM(2) OR 10(8) W/CM(2)) TO FLASH EVAPORATE YBA2CU3OX PELLETS FOR DEPOSITION ON HEATED SUBSTRATES. THIS POWER DENSITY IS COMPARABLE TO THAT REPORTED USING LASERS FOR PULSED EVAPORATION. THE E-BEAM SYSTEM IS EFFICIENT (ABOUT 80%), THE ELECTRONS HAVE LONG RANGE (10 TO 20 UM) COMPARED TO LASERS, AND THE COUPLING EFFICIENCY TO THE MATERIAL TARGET IS ESSENTIALLY 100%. THE GREATER RANGE SHOULD RESULT IN A SMOOTHER EVAPORATION PROCESS AS COMPARED TO THE \"EXPLOSIVE\" EVAPORATION REPORTED UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS OF LASER ABLATION. OTHER KEY ADVANTAGES OF THIS APPROACH INCLUDE PULSED EVAPORATION OF THE MATERIAL IN THE PRESENCE OF PLASMA; THIS IN TURN PRODUCES ATOMIC OXYGEN ATOMS AND IONS (AS WELL AS O2). PHASE I WILL DEVELOP THE OPERATION OF THIS UNIQUE PULSED E-BEAM PLUS A PLASMA ARRANGEMENT TO EVAPORATE HTS MATERIAL AND FORM THIN FILMS ONSUBSTRATES. THE FILMS WILL BE CHARACTERIZED BY RUTHERFORD BACKSCATTERING SPECTROMETRY TO DETERMINE THE STOICHIOMETRY. AFTER AN ANNEAL, THE RESISTIVITY VERSUS TEMPERATURE WILL BE DETERMINED WITH A FOUR-POINT PROBE.",

PROVISION IS MADE FOR POSSIBLE USE OF MORE THAN ONE LAYER OF SUPERCONDUCTING MATERIAL. THE SUPERCONDUCTING LAYER (ELG. Y-BA-CU-O) MAY BE MIXED WITH SILVER AND ALSO PERHAPS FACED ON BOTH SIDES WITH SILVER LAYERS. THE PRESENCE OF SILVER IS EXPECTED TO IMPROVE THE CONDUCTIVITY WITH NO ADVERSE EFFECT DUE TO HIGH-TEMPERATURE CHEMICAL REACTIONS. TWO CONFIGURATIONS ARE PROPOSED, NAMELY, A TAPE CONFIGURATION AND A WIRE CONFIGURATION. IN THE TAPE CONFIGURATION, A HIGH-STRENGTH TAPE OF NICKEL ALLOY OR STEEL IS USED AND IN THE WIRE CONFIGURATION A NICKEL ALLOY OR STEEL FILAMENT IS USED. ONE SIGNFICIANT ADVANTAGE OF THE TAPE CONFIGURATION IS THAT THE SUPERCONDUCTING COMPOSITE LAYERS CAN BE FORMED ON A SILVER FOIL AND THEN AFTER HIGH-TEMPERATURE ANNEALING BE LAMINATED TO THE HIGH-STRENGTH SUBSTRATE. THIS PROCESS WILL ELIMINATE THE HIGH-TEMPERATURE CHEMICAL REACTION BETWEEN THE SUBSTRATE AND THE COMPOSITE STRUCTURE.

USING THEIR REAGENTS AND METHODS, PSL WILL ASSAY 1,000 BMD/DMD BIOPSY SAMPLES AND 1,000 CONTROLS FROM 20 NEUROMUSCULAR DISEASES FOR THE DIAGNOSTIC MARKER. IF VALIDATED, THESE DATA WILL BE USED IN SUBMISSION TO THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION FOR APPROVAL TO USE THIS TEST IN PSL'S COMMERCIAL REFERENCE LABORATORY, WHICH IS DEDICATED TO PROVIDING GENETIC-SCREENING SERVICES USING PROTEIN-BASED DIAGNOSTICS. THIS APPROACH WILL BE USED FOR FURTHER WORK ON CARRIER AND PRENTAL TESTING, AND FOR OTHER GENETIC DISEASES WHERE THE DEFECTIVE GENES HAVE BEEN CLONED. UNLIKE OTHER GENE-BASED TESTS, WHICH REQUIRE MULTIPLE FAMILY SAMPLES AND PREDICT ONLY THE PROBABILITY OF THE DISEASE, THIS TEST WOULD PROVIDE A DEFINITIVE YES OR NO ON A SINGLE PATIENT SAMPLE.",

THE LIGHT SHUTTER INVOLVES THE APPLICATION OF A REVERSE PHASE MODE POLYMER DISPERSED LIQUID CRYSTAL (PDLC) WHICH HAS BEEN DEVELOPED IN OUR LABORATORIES. THE REVERSE PHASE MODE PDLC SYSTEM PROVIDES LC ALIGNMENT AND THUS GOOD OPTICAL TRANSMISSION IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY APPLIED FIELDS. THIS OPTICAL ALIGNMENT HAS BEEN OBTAINED USING A PROPRIETARY APPROACH DEVELOPED BY POLYTRONIX, INC. IMPINGEMENT OF LASER RADIATION ON THIS REVERSE PHASE PDLC MATERIAL CONVERTS IT FROM A TRANSMISSIVE TO A SCATTERING (DISPERSIVE) MODE. THE LIGHT SHUTTER LENS DEVELOPED ON THIS PRINCIPLE WILL OPERATE WITHOUT NEED FOR AN APPLIED VOLTAGE OR ANY PHOTODETECTOR SWITCHES. THE ADVANTAGES OF OUR PROPOSED TECHNOLOGYVIS-A-VIS OTHER CURRENT APPROACHES TO LIGHT SHUTTER PROTECTIVE DEVICES ARE DISCUSSED IN THIS PROPOSAL. THE PHASE I WORK EFFORT WILL FOCUS ON IMPROVING THE OPTICAL TRANSMISSION CHARACTERISTICS OF THE REVERSE PHASE MODE PDLC ALIGNMENT AND WILL ALSO INVOLVE DETAILED MEASUREMENTS OF THE RESPONSE TIME OF THIS SHUTTER AT VARIOUS INCIDENT LASER WAVELENGTHS AND POWER DENSITIES. A COMPLETE, FULLY OPERATIONAL LIGHT SHUTTER WOULD CULMINATE THE PHASE I EFFORT.",

THE SITUATION CAN DETERIORATE FURTHER WHEN HIGH VALUE AND NUCLEAR ASSETS, WHICH COULD ATTRACT VERY SOPHISTICATED PENETRATION ATTEMPS ARE INVOLVED. FINALLY, DEPLOYMENT OF THESE ASSETS IN MOBILE OR TEMPORARY MILITARY SITUATIONS CAN CREATE AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT SECURITY SITUATION. THE CONFLICTING GOALS OF INCREASING SECURITY EFFECTIVENESS WHILE REDUCING INVOLVED PERSONNEL LEADS TO THE INVESTIGATION OF TECHNOLOGICAL ALTERNATIVES. A DISTRIBUTED RADAR IS APPLIED TO THE MOBILE/PORTABLE SITE SECURITY SURVEILLANCE IN THE PROPOSED STUDY. NO EXISTING SYSTEM OFFERS INTRUDER DETECTION, CLASSIFICATION AND TRACKING ABILITIES UNDER ALL ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. THE STUDY WILL ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE POTENTIAL OF THIS HIGH RESOLUTION IMAGING CONCEPT AND COMPARE IT WITH EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES.

THE TECHNIQUE REQUIRES ONLY THAT AN AEROSOLIZING GAS BE BUBBLED THROUGH A SOLUTION OF A STABLE COMPOUND OF THE ISOTOPIC SPECIES. THE AEROSOL DROPLETS FORMED BY THE BURSTING BUBBLES AT THE LIQUID SURFACE CAN QUITE EFFECTIVELY SEPARATETHE SURFACE PHASE FROM THE BULK LIQUID PHASE. THE AEROSOL IS THEN TRANSPORTED BY CARRIER GAS TO A FILTER WHERE THE SOLUTE IS CAPTURED. RESEARCH WITH ISOMERS PROVED THAT MIXTURE COMPOSITION CHANGES SIGNIFICANTLY UPON A SINGLE AEROSOLIZATION. EVIDENCE IS CITED TO SHOW THAT ISOTOPES MAYALSO BE SO SEPARATED. AEROSOLIZATION WORKS WITH A MORE PUREFILM PHASE THAN EITHER BUBBLE OR FOAM FRACTIONATION. THE ENRICHMENT IS EXPLAINED THROUGH GIBBS' ADSORPTION EQUATION. DIFFERENCES IN SURFACE TENSION STEMMING FROM DIFFERENT ISOTOPES CAUSE DIFFERENCES IN RELATIVE SOLUTE CONCENTRATIONS IN THE SURFACE AND BULK PHASES. THIS RESEARCH ON SEPARATION BY AEROSOLIZATION WILL PROVIDE FUNDAMENTAL INFORMATION ON THE EFFECT OF ISOTOPE MASS ON THE PROPERTIES OF SURFACE PHASES AS IT ALSO EXTENDS THE HORIZONS OF SEPARATION SCIENCE AND PRODUCES A NEW AND EFFICIENT METHOD OF ISOTOPE SEPARATION. IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO REVOLUTIONIZE THE FIELD OF ISOTOPE SEPARATION. THIS HAS PROFOUND IMPLICATIONS FOR NUCLEAR POWER.",

THE MONITORING OF WEAR METALS IN LUBRICATING OILS HAS BECOME STANDARD PRACTICE IN THE AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY TO ANTICIPATE INCIPIENT FAILURES OF COMPONENTS INSIDE GAS TURBINE ENGINES. THIS PRACTICE IS ALSO FOLLOWED BY THE UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES, IN THE TRI-SERVICE JOINT OIL ANALYSIS PROGRAM (JOAL) LABORATORIES. ONE OF THE TECHNIQUES USED TO MONITOR AND ANALYSE OIL DEBRIS IS THE X-RAY FLUORESCENCE SPECTROSCOPY (XRFS) TECHNIQUE.

DEVELOPMENT OF A COMMERCIAL DEVICE TO DETERMINE THE CONCENTRATIONS OF ATTACHED AND UNATTACHED FRACTIONS IS ESSENTIAL TO COUNT DECAY PRODUCTS AND ASSESS HEALTH EFFECTS ACCURATELY. PHASE I INVOLVES TESTING AND OPTIMIZATION OF IMPROVED INSTRUMENTATION TO DETERMINE CONCENTRATION OF RADON PROGENY IN THE AIR. THE DEVICE WILL DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE ATTACHED AND UNATTACHED FRACTIONS OF RADON PROGENY. DETAILS ON THE ACTIVITY SIZE DISTRIBUTIONOF PARTICLES LESS THAN 10 NM CAN BE PROVIDED BY FURTHER ANALYSIS OF THE DETECTION MATERIAL. BASED UPON PRELIMINARY RESULTS, THE DETECTOR IS VERSATILE ENOUGH TO DETERMINE THE EQUILIBRIUM FACTOR AND THE UNATTACHED FRACTION. DETECTOR CAPABILITIES WILL BE EVALUATED IN A VARIETY OF CONTROLLED AEROSOL ENVIRONMENTS. A SPECIFIC EVALUATION WILL BE DONE ONTHE BINDING POTENTIAL OF TOBACCO SMOKE OVER A WIDE RANGE OF AEROSOL ENVIRONMENTS. RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT BY CHANGING THE CONFIGURATION AND DETECTION MATERIALS, SENSITIVITY CAN BE ALTERED TO VARY RUN TIMES FROM THE SHORT TERM (3 TO 5 DAYS) TO THE LONG TERM (3 TO 6 MONTHS). THE PROTOTYPES CAN BE MODIFIED TO CONVERT THEM INTO INEXPENSIVE MAIL-IN DEVICES. THIS ACCESSIBILITY BY THE GENERAL POPULATION WILL IN TURN PROVIDE MORE ACCURATE ESTIMATES OF DOSE VERSUS EXPOSURE UNDER A VARIETY OF ATMOSOPHERIC CONDITIONS. IMPROVED ESTIMATES OF DOSE WILL REDUCE THE UNCERTAINTY IN CURRENT NATIONAL LUNG RISK PROJECTIONS.",

THE USE OF THESE FIBERS WILL LEAD TO A NEGATIVE EXPANSION IN THE HEAT SINK. THEREFORE, METAL ADDITONS TO THE HEAT SINK WILL BE MADE TO INCREASE THE THERMAL EXPANSION TO MATCH THE GLASS-EPOXY SEM E DIELECTRIC. IT IS PLANNED TO USE BOTH A COPPER-COATED GRAPHITE FIBER TOW AND GRAPHITE-ALUMINUM WIRE FOR THIS PURPOSE. THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL BE DEMONSTRATED IN BOTH EPOXY AND THERMOPLASTIC COMPOSITES. HEAT SINK JOINING TO THE DIELECTRIC WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY CO-CURING OR COMPRESSION MOLDING. EVALUATION WILL BE BASED ON THERMAL AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES MEASURED BEFORE AND AFTER THERMAL CYCLING, USING SEM E SPECIFICATIONS. OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE IS A COMPARISON OF PROPERTIES OF THE INTEGRAL DIELECTRIC/HEAT SINK WITH ADHESIVELY BONDED COMPONENTS.

THE VEHICLE IS A HARDWARE-SOFTWARE SYSTEM THAT WILL BE LEASED OR SOLD TO SERVICE PROVIDERS SUCH AS HOSPITAL CLINICS OR HMO'S. IN PHASE I, A PROTOTYPE MODULE CONCERNING COMMON CHILDHOOD BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS, SUCH AS BEDWETTING AND SLEEP PROBLEMS, WILL BE DEVELOPED. PHASE I WILL CONSIST OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT AND A SMALL DEMONSTRATION PROJECT TO ASSESS FEASIBILITY, USER INTEREST, AND APPLICATIONS. USING READILY AVAILABLE, SOPHISTICATED, AND INEXPENSIVE GRAPHICS PROGRAMS TO CREATE THE SCREENS, PROGRAMS WILL BE DEVELOPED THAT ARE THEN LINKED TOGETHER IN A MULTIPLE-CHOICE FORMAT. THE SYSTEM WILL BE TESTED IN TWO WAYS: (1) BY ALLOWING ONE MICROCOMPUTER TO RUN UNATTENDED IN THE BELLEVUE PEDIATRIC CLINIC WAITING ROOM, COLLECTING DATA VIA THE PROGRAMMING, AND (2) BY COMPARING PATIENTS REFERRED TO AN ONGOING BEHAVIOR CLINIC WHO HAVE BEEN DIRECTED TO USE THE COMPUTER DURING THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THEIR FIRST BEING IDENTIFIED AND THEIR APPOINTMENT WITH THOSE WHO ARE NOT DIRECTED TO USETHE COMPUTER.",

THE METHOD WORKS WELL EVEN ON IMAGES SEQUENCES FROM MOVING PLATFORMS. IN THIS PHASE I PROGRAM WE PROPOSE TO TEST ITS APPLICABILITY TO TARGET RECOGNITION AND TRACKING SCENARIOS IN FLIR IMAGES. IF APPLICABLE TO THESE SCENARIOS, THE METHOD CAN PROVIDE THE SEEKER FOR A NON-SCANNING, CHEAP, RELIABLE, MULTI-TARGET TRACKER, OR FOR A WEAPON LAUNCHED TOWARD SUSPECTED ENEMY TARGETS WHICH FINDS AND KILLS ANYTHING THAT IS MOVING. AS AN ADDITION TO CURRENT TARGET ACQUISITION AND TRACKING TECHNOLOGY, RELIABLE MOTION DETECTION CAN IMPROVE ITS PERFORMANCE DRAMATICALLY. FURTHER, THE METHOD WORKS WELL ON COMPLEX, CLUTTERED VISIBLE-LIGHT TV IMAGES, RAISING THE POSSIBILITY OF DRAMATIC COST REDUCTIONS BY SUBSTITUTING CHEAP TVS IN SOME SYSTEMS WHICH CURRENTLY USE FLIRS. THE METHOD HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED ON A SIMPLE PIPELINED IMAGE COMPUTER WHICH OPERATES AT VIDEO FRAME RATES. IT PROBABLY CAN BE IMPLEMENTED AS AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT, ALLOWING IT AND A TV CMERA TO FIT INTO VERY SMALL WARHEADS. RELIABLE MOTION DETECTION IS A KEY ELEMENT PREVIOUSLY MISSING FROM AUTONOMOUS TARGET ACQUISITION AND TRACKING SYSTEMS.",

IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE INTERPRETATION, IDENTIFICATION, AND MEASUREMENT OF CERTAIN PARAMETERS (E.G., PH, ELECTROLYTIC ION CONCENTRATION, AND BIOCHEMICAL TRANSFER MECHANISMS) CAN BE AUGMENTED AND ENHANCED BY DERIVING DATA FROM A LIFE (LASER-INDUCED FLUORESCENCE ENDOSCOPE) SYSTEM. THE LIFE SYSTEM IS BASED UPON THE CONCEPT OF FIBEROPTIC SPECTROSCOPY IN CONCERT WITH ULTRAVIOLET (U/V) LASER EXCITATION OF THE TARGET AREA AND ELECTRONIC DATA ACQUISITION MEANS TO STORE AND PROCESS THE RESULTING IMAGE AND ITS SPECTRA. PREVIOUS WORK IN THIS AREA EMPLOYED U/V LASERS AS THE EXCITATION MEANS, TYPICALLY OF THE HELIUM-CADMIUM TYPE. THESE LASERS ARE QUITE DELICATE, EXPENSIVE, AND HIGHLY MONOCHROMATIC. EVENTUALLY, ALTERNATE U/V LIGHT SOURCES THAT CAN BE DIRECTED AND SCANNED SO THAT VERY SMALL AREAS OF TISSUE CAN BE EXAMINED FOR SPECTRAL RESPONSE WITHOUT PHOTOBLEACHING NONCONTRIBUTING AREAS WILL BE INVESTIGATED. A MAJOR ADVANTAGE OF THIS APPROACH IS THAT IN THE FINAL EMBODIMENT THIS SYSTEM GIVES A COMPLETE TWO-DIMENSIONAL ENSEMBLE OF SPECTRAL DATA. IN EFFECT, EVERY POINT OF THE RECOVERED IMAGE WOULD HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH IT ITS RESPECTIVESPECTRAL \"SIGNATURE\". THESE DATA COULD PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR MORE ACCURATE DETECTION OF ANOMALIES AND COULD BE RECOVERED AND DISPLAYED AT EACH FREQUENCY BAND OF INTEREST.",

THROUGH THIS ANALYSIS, BETTER APPROACHES WILL BE DEVELOPED TO MODELING THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL DISTRIBUTION OF PERMEABILITY AND FLUIDMOVEMENT POTENTIAL OF COMPLEX SANDSTONE RESERVOIRS TO STUDY HYDROCARBON PRODUCTION WHERE THESE STRUCTURES ARE TAPPED BY HORIZONTAL BOREHOLES. THIS GELLOGICAL/ENGINEERING STUDY IS NEEDED TO KEEP PACE WITH THE RAPIDLY ADVANCING TECHNOLOGYOF HORIZONTAL DRILLING AND THE PRODUCTION OF HYDROCARBONS FROM HORIZONTAL DRAINHOLES.

THE PROCESS IS BASED ON A NEW FAMILY OF DRY SORBENTS. THE SORBENTS CONSIST OF INEXPENSIVE METAL OXIDES COATED AND BONDED TO INEXPENSIVE SUPPORT MATERIALS WITH HUGE SURFACE AREAS, SUCH AS VERMICULITE OR PERLITE. TWO COMBINATIONS, MGO-VERMICULITE AND CAO-PERLITE, HAVE SHOWN EXCEPTIONAL PROPERTIES IN LABORATORY AND PROCESS DEVELOPMENT UNIT (PDU) TESTS. THE PROCESS VERY EFFECTIVELY REMOVES SO2 AND SOME NOX FROM FLUE GASES. IT ALSO REMOVES FINE PARTICULATES NOT PICKED YP BY A BAGHOUSE OR ELECTROSTATIC PRECIPITATOR, INCLUDING PARTICULATE MATTER LESS THAN 10 MICRON SIZE (PM10) PARTICLES. THE NEW SORBENTSHAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED SUCCESSFULLY AT THE PDU SCALE (200 TO250 ACTUAL CUBIC FEET PER MINUTE (ACFM)). THE PROJECT'S OBJECTIVE (PHASES I AND II) IS TO SCALE UP AND DEMONSTRATE THE PROCESS AT THE PILOT SCALE. THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED IN TWO STEPS. IN THE FIRST STEP (PHASE I), THE PROCESS WILLBE DEMONSTRATED ON A 1,000-ACFM SIDE STREAM OF FLUE GAS AT KENT STATE UNIVERSITY'S COAL- FIRED COMBUSTOR STEAM PLANT. IN THE SECOND STEP (PHASE II), THE PROCESS WILL BE SCALED UP FURTHER TO HANDLE ALL OR A LARGE PORTION OF THE FLUE GAS FROM A BOILER (40,000 ACFM). THE SORBENT WILL BE APPLIED AS A MOVING PANEL- BED FILTER OF A NOVEL DESIGN. TWO VERSIONS OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGY WILL BE INVESTIGATED. ONE VERSION WILL INVOLVE THROWAWAY SORBENTS, APPLICABLE TO VERY SMALL COMBUSTORS. A SECOND VERSION WILL INVOLVE A SORBENT SYSTEM IN WHICH THE SORBENT IS REGENERABLE AND CAN BE RE-USED.",

THE ULTIMATE SUCCESS OF ECH AS A METHOD OF AUXILIARY HEATING WILL DEPEND ON THE AVAILABILITY OF ECONOMICAL MILLIMETER-WAVE SOURCES AT THE APPROPRIATE FREQUENCIES (250 TO 600 GHZ) AND POWER LEVELS (1 MW). THE FREE-ELECTRON LASER (FEL) AND THE CYCLOTRON AUTORESONANCE MASER (CARM) ARE BOTH CANDIDATES FOR HIGH POWER TUNABLE ECH RADIATION SOURCES. THESE RADIATION SOURCES RELY ON ACCELERATOR FACILITIES TO PROVIDE HIGH ENERGY (1 TO 10 MEV),HIGH AVERAGE POWER (2 TO 50 MW) ELECTRON BEAMS. CONSEQUENTLY, THE DEVELOPMENT OF ECONOMICAL FELS AND CARMS WILL REQUIRE THE AVAILABILITY OF LOW COST, HIGH EFFICIENCY ACCELERATOR TECHNOLOGY. THE INDUCTION LINAC IS THE ACCELERATOR OF CHOICE FOR DRIVING HIGH POWER MILLIMETER-WAVEDEVICES. IT IS UNIQUE IN ITS CAPABILITY TO ACCELERATE HIGH PEAK CURRENTS (1,000 A) TO SEVERAL MEV WITH A HIGH PULSE REPETITION RATE (1,000 HZ), DELIVERING MULTI-MW ELECTRON-BEAM (E-BEAM) POWER TO THE FEL WIGGLER OR CARM RESONATOR.

THE SPECTROFLUORIMETER WOULD PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT AMBIENT AIR CONSTITUENTS AND THEIR FLUORESCENCE CHARACTERISTICS NEAR THE LIMITS OF INTEREST FOR AIRBREATHING PROPULSION AND AERODYNAMIC HEATING. IN ADDITION TO THEIR INTRINSIC VALUE, THESE RESULTS WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE OPTIMAL DESIGN OF A TIME-RESOLVED LASER-INDUCED-FLUORESCENCE THERMOMETER WHICH WOULD OBTAIN DISTRIBUTIONS OF MEAN AND FLUCTUATING TEMPERATURE IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER OF FLIGHT RESEARCH VEHICLES, FOR EXAMPLE HYPERSONIC CONES. THE TIME-RESOLVED MEASUREMENT OF FLUORESCENCE CHARACTERISTICS FOR TEMPERATURE IS ALSO INNOVATIVE AND IS REQUIRED TO OBTAIN USEFUL RESULTS AT LOW FLUORESCENCE INTENSITIES AND TO QUANTIFY QUENCHING CORRECTIONS THAT HAVE PREVIOUSLY INTRODUCED UNACCEPTABLE UNCERTAINTIES AND PREVENTED PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF FLUORESCENCE TO FLIGHT RESEARCH. PHASE I WOULD PROVIDE FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENTS OF BOTH INSTRUMENTS, WOULD TEST A PROTOTYPE SPECTROFLUORIMETER AND WOULD PLACE EMPHASIS ON THE TWO MOST CRITICAL ASPECTS WHICH ARE THE ADEQUATE RESOLUTION OF FLUORESCENCE SIGNALS AND THE FLUORESCENCE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE REAL GASES AT THE PROPOSED ALTITUDES AND SPEEDS. FINAL ENGINEERING DESIGN OF THE SPECTROFLUORIMETER, FLIGHT-HARDENING, ASSOCIATED MECHANICAL TESTING, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE TIME-RESOLVED FLUORESCENCE THERMOMETER, ITS REFINEMENT AND OPTIMIZATION WOULD ALL BE ADDRESSED IN PHASE II. PHASE II WOULD PROVIDE PROVEN PROTOTYPES OF THE SPECTRAL FLUORIMETER AND FLUORESCENCE THERMOMETER WITH THE NECESSARY FEATURES FOR PHASE III INSTALLATION AND FLIGHT MEASUREMENTS.",

THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUE IS BASED ON A MODIFICATION OF THE EXISTING OPTICAL SCINTILLOMETER FOR WIND MEASUREMENT DEVELOPMENT BY WAVE PROPAGATION LABORATORY OF NOAA. THE OLD SCINTILLOMETER WAS DESIGNED TO MEASURE THE CROSSWIND ONLY. HOWEVER, WITH THE HELP OF MORE SOPHISTICATED ALGORITHM, A SECOND GENERATION OPTICAL SCINTILLOMETER IS ABLE TO MEASURE BOTH ATMOSPHERIC TURBULENCE INTENSITY AND WIND USING A NATURALLY ILLUMINATED SCENE. THE INSTRUMENT WILL PROVIDE REAL-TIME CONTINUOUS MEASUREMENTS OF TURBULENCE INTENSITY IN THE FIELD OPERATION; ALTHOUGH FOGS AND SMOKES MAY OCCASIONALLY INTERRUPT THE MEASUREMENTS, THE INSTRUMENT IS INSENSITIVE TO ENVIRONMENTAL ACOUSTIC AND ELECTROMAGNETIC NOISES. IT IS COMPACT FOR EASY TRANSPORTING AND OPERATIONS.",

SUCH ANTENNAS CAN BE COVERED WITH A METALLIC RADOME THAT MINIMIZES THE RCS TO OUT-OF-BAND THREAT RADAR SIGNALS. BUT IT CANNOT SIMILARLY SUPPRESS INBAND SIGNALS. SUCH SIGNALS WILL PASS THROUGH THE RADOME AND BE SUBJECTED TO SCATTER BY THE ANTENNA BEHIND IT. THIS SCATTER IS A PRESENT-DAY LIMITATION TO THE PRESERVATION OF VERY LOW PLATFORM OBSERVABILITY. THIS PROPOSAL DESCRIBES A PHASED ARRAY DESIGN THAT SOLVES THIS REMAINING PROBLEM. IT RESULTS IN AN ANTENNA SYSTEM WITH A VERY LOW RCS OVER VIRTUALLY ALL ASPECT ANGLES AND POLARIZATIONS IN-BAND, AND A SIGNIFICANT RCS REDUCTION OVER THE ENTIRE THREAT RADAR BAND. MOREOVER, THE PROPOSED IN-BAND RCS REDUCTION TECHNIQUE WILL IMPOSE NO PENALTY IN RADAR PERFORMANCE. THE TECHNIQUE FOR DOING THIS INVOLVES AN ARRAY GROUND PLANE THAT IS BOTH POLARIZATION DEPENDENT AND FREQUENCY DEPENDENT. FOR CROSS-POLARIZED INCIDENT WAVES OF ALL FREQUENCIES, THE ARRAY APPEARS TO BE A GOOD MICROWAVE ABSORBER WHILE FOR CO-POLARIZED INCIDENT WAVES ABOVE-BAND, IT BECOMES VERY LOSSY. ARRAY ELEMENTS RECEIVING CO-POLARIZED SIGNALS IN-BAND ARE CONJUGATE MATCHED TO MINIMIZE SPECULAR SCATTER.",

AN EXTREMELY HIGH MEAN TIME BETWEEN FAILURE FIGURE IS EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE APPLICATION OF BOTH HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE FAULT TOLERANCE TECHNIQUES. THE SOFTWARE FAULT TOLERANCE TECHNIQUES INCLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF ROBUST DATA TRANSMISSION SOFTWARE, SOFTWARE VALIDITY ALGORITHMS, AND REDUNDANT POSITION COMPUTATION ALGORITHMS. REVERSIONARY MODES OF OPERATION ARE PLANNED TO ACCOMMODATE CONTINUED OPERATION IN THE FACE OF SENSOR FAILURES. THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE FAULT TOLERANCE SHALL BE VERIFIED THROUGH SIMULATION. CRITICAL NAVIGATION SENSORS SHALL BE REPLICATED AS REQUIRED.",

THERE ISA LACK OF COMMUNICATION FROM THE CONSUMER TO THE RETAILER, TO THE APPAREL MANUFACTURER, AND TO THE TEXTILE MILL; YET THERE EXISTS A VAST AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THAT WHEN EFFECTIVELY SYSTEMATIZED COULD SOLVE MULTIPLE PROBLEMS. MOST APPAREL INFORMATION IS COMPOSED OF 2-DIMENSIONAL AND 3-DIMENSIONAL IMAGES, AND CONCEPTUAL MOVEMENT PATTERNS IN APPAREL DESIGNING AND PRODUCTION; AND THERE IS NO AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN SORT IMAGES FOR A DATABASE. \"STYLOMETRICS\", AN INNOVATIVE IDEA FOR SUCH A LANGUAGE, IS BEING DESIGNED BY SHIRLEY WILLETT, INC. THIS LANGUAGE WILL COMPRESS APPAREL IMAGES TO A CODE SIMILAR TO A BINARY CODE, BUT IT WILL BE COMPOSED OF STRAIGHT LINES AND LENGTHS. THE FEASIBILITY OF \"STYLOMETRICS\" WILL BE INVESTIGATED AND EVALUATED THROUGH THE RESEARCH PROJECTS. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THIS IMAGE COMPRESSION TECHNOLOGY WILL ENABLE IMAGES TO BE CODIFIED AND SORTED TO BUILD AN INDEXED, INTERACTIVE ELECTRONIC ENCYCLOPEDIA OF APPAREL INFORMATION.",

THE PROPOSED CONCEPT IS BASED UPON THE ADAPTATION OF THE CCD CLOCK SIGNALS TO OUTPUT THE DESIRED IMAGE. PROPER SHIFTING OF THE CCD VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL REGISTERS PRIOR TO IMAGE OUTPUT THROWS AWAY THE UNWANTED PORTION OF SCENE FOR REAL-TIME OPERATION. THE IMAGE IS THEN SAMPLED AT A SLOWER THAN NORMAL RATE TO MAINTAIN SAME OUTPUT FORMAT. THE PRELIMINARY DESIGN IS BASED ON A CCD CAMERA WITH 488 BY 380 RESOLUTION. HOWEVER, THE PROPOSED METHODOLOGY IS APPLICABLE TO BOTH LOW AND HIGH RESOLUTION IMAGING DEVICES AND CAN ALSO BE EXPANDED TO ELECTRONIC ROLLING OF THE IMAGE PLANE.",

THIS METHOD WILL BE BASED ON MEASURING HOW EACH COMPONENT OF AN IMAGE PROCESSING SYSTEM DISTORTS THE SHAPE OF A TARGET OR CLUTTER OBJECT.

(III) FIND A PARAMETRIC SET OF TEST PATTERNS WHICH IS HOMOMORPHIC TO REAL TARGETS AND CLUTTER WITH RESPECT TO THE CHOSEN SHAPE DISTORTION MEASURE SO THAT TARGET AND CLUTTER INDEPENDENT PERFORMANCE RESULTS MAY BE ACHIEVED BY ANALYZING ONLY A SMALL SET OF DATA.",

THE VLSI COMPONENT WILL CONTAIN 128 PARALLEL CHANNELS, EACH OF WHICH WILL COMPRISE 4-BIT PULSE-HEIGHT DATA ACQUISITION, AN 80-BIT CUSTOM PROCESSOR FOR SIGNIFICANT EVENT DETERMINATION, AND FIBER OPTIC DRIVERS FOR OUTPUT. DATA THROUGH-PUT THROUGH ALL CHANNELS WILL BE CLOCKED SIMULTANEOUSLY AT 62.5 MHZ WITH OVER-ALL POWER DISSIPATION AT LESS THAN 5 MW PER CHANNEL. SAMPLES OF THE VLSI COMPONENT WILL BE PRODUCED USING PROPRIETARY NEW ULTRA HIGH SPEED TECHNOLOGY, VERTICALLY INTEGRATED INJECTION, WHICH IS BEING USED TO DEVELOP SINGLE-CHIP, SUPERCOMPUTER PROCESSORS AND MEMORIES ON SILICON. THIS TECHNOLOGY AIMS AT 9,500 MHZ CLOCK- SPEED AND OFFERS 10 TO 30 TIMES LOWER POWER DISSIPATION (PER GATE)THAN OTHER STATE-OF-THE-ART GAAS OR SI-BASED TECHNOLOGIES. IT IS BASED ON A NEW DEVICE USED TO REPLACE THE CONVENTIONALTRANSISTOR THAT IS THE CORNERSTONE OF ALL OTHER KNOWN VLSI TECHNOLOGIES. ADVANTAGES ARE THE SUPERIOR RADIATION HARDNESS (THERE ARE NO P-N JUNCTIONS TO THE SUBSTRATE), ITS HIGH SPEED AT 2 UM MINIMUM FEATURE SIZE (5 TO 7 PICOSECONDS LOGIC GATE DELAYS WITH 30 MIL OF INTERCONNECT), AND VERY HIGH INTEGRATION DENSITY (100,000 GATES IN 190 MIL(2) AT 2 UM). THE VLSI COMPONENT WILL BE MOUNTED ON A COMMON SUBSTRATE WITH THE MICROSTRIP DETECTOR ITSELF FOR HIGHEST SPEED AND SIGNAL DETECTION EFFICIENCY.

THE FLUORIDE HOST SHOULD GREATLY IMPROVE THE LASER PERFORMANCE OF THE ION COMBINATION.

THE CO-DOPED SYSTEM WILL BE PUMPED BY VISIBLE SOURCES FOR INITIAL INVESTIGATIONS BUT CAN BE PUMPED BY GAALAS DIODES IN THE 750-850 NM RANGE FOR HIGHER EFFICIENCY.

THIS DEVICE HAS A NOVEL GEOMETRY WHICH UTILIZES THE PLASMA DYNAMICS HYPOCYCLOIDALLY PINCHED INTO THE RADIAL DIRECTION AND EVENTUALLY RESULTING IN A VERY STABLE, HIGH ENERGY, AND HIGHLY DENSE PLASMA IN ITS AXIAL CENTER. THE EMISSION SPECTRA FROM THIS HIGHLY COMPRESSED AND STABLE PLASMA IS COMPOSED MAINLY OF A WAVEBAND OF INTENSE SOFT X-RAY. THE SIZE OF PINCHED PLASMA IS SO SMALL IN DIAMETER THAT THE PENUMBRA EFFECT CAN BE ALSO MINIMIZED IN THE PHOTO-LITHOGRAPHY. THIS STABLE AND HIGHLY COMPRESSED PLASMA GUARANTEES THE REPRODUCIBILITY OF THE SOFT X-RAY EMISSION AND ITS INTENSE EMISSION ENSURES THE FAST THROUGHTPUT. THE PROPOSED HCP SOFT X-RAY LIGHT SOURCE IS ANINEXPENSIVE SYSTEM, SO THAT IT IS IDEAL FOR THE SMALL BUSINESS ENTITIES AND UNIVERSITY LABORATORIES.",

THE PROPOSED INNOVATION WILL UTILIZE INEXPENSIVE ROOM TEMPERATURE LASER DIODES TO MEASURE ABSORPTION BY WATER VAPOR AT NEAR-INFRARED WAVELENGTHS. THESE LASERS WILL BE USED IN COMBINATION WITH HIGH FREQUENCY DETECTION TECHNIQUES TO DEVELOP A WATER VAPOR DIAGNOSTIC WITH HIGH SENSITIVITY, WIDE DYNAMIC RANGE, AND THE CAPABILITY FOR EXTREMELY FAST TIME RESPONSE. THE DIAGNOSTIC COULD ALSO BE USED FOR MEASUREMENT OF TEMPERATURE AND FLOW VELOCITY IN HYPERSONIC FLOWS. AN IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTIC OF THIS INNOVATION IS THAT THE MEASUREMENTS ARE NONINTRUSIVE. IN COMPARISON WITH OTHER POTENTIAL OPTICALLY-BASED METHODS FOR MEASURING WATER VAPOR CONCENTRATIONS, THE PROPOSED APPROACH USES EXCEPTIONALLY RELIABLE AND INEXPENSIVE LASER SOURCES WHICH CAN READILY BE COMBINED WITH FIBER OPTICS FOR MULTI-POINTING MONITORING. THE FEASIBILITY OF THE TECHNIQUE WILL BE DEMONSTRATED IN PHASE I BY MEASURMENTS IN A ROOM TEMPERATURE ABSORPTION CELL AND IN THE POST-FLAME GASES OF A METHANE-AIR FLAME.",

SPARTA PROPOSES A NOVEL DESIGN THAT CAN ACCELERATE AT LEVELS GREATER THAN 20,000 G AND THAT HAVE BURN TIMES LESS THAN 10 MILLISECONDS. THE SPARTA SOLUTION TO THE DESIGN OF HIGH ACCELERATION VERY SHORT BURN TIME ROCKETS IS TO USE AVAILABLE FULLY DEVELOPED GRANDULAR GUN PROPELLANT AND CHANGE THE BASIC DESIGN OF THE ROCKET MOTOR. GRANDULAR GUN PROPELLANTS WOULD BE LOADED INTO A ROCKET MOTOR CASE WITH AN INTEGRAL SUBMERGED NOZZLE WHOSE ENTRANCE IS NEAR THE TOP OF THE MOTOR DOME. ACCELERATION INDUCED INERTIA FORCES WOULD KEEP THE PROPELLANT WITHIN THE MOTOR CAVITY AND ONLY GASES WOULD EXIT THROUGH THE NOZZLE.

THE RESEARCH PLANSCALL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ABRASIVE SOL-GEL COATING TO BE APPLIED ONTO THE CARBON FIBER WHICH HAS BEEN IMPREGNATED AND COATED WITH A HARD METAL FILM. SOL-GEL PROCESSES INVOLVE INCORPORATION OF SIC SURFACE MODIFIED ABRASIVE GRANULES IN HIGH DENSITIES IN A SI BASED SOL-GEL. THE WIRE IS DESIGNED FOR MONODIRECTIONAL SAWING (OPPOSED TO RECIPROCATING) AND THE SOL-GEL ACTS AS A SACRIFICIAL HOST TOTHE ABRASIVE PARTICULATE. A SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF WIRE DIAMETER BETWEEN 50 AND 150 MICRON WILL BE CONDUCTED FOR VARIOUS ABRASIVE SIZES (10,25,40 MICRON). AS A DEMONSTRATION, A SMALL DIAMETER SILICON INGOT WILL BE SLICEDAND THE WAFER, AS WELL AS WIRE WEAR, WILL BE ANALYZED. FUTURE PLANS FOR ON-LINE WIRE REHABILITATION ARE OUTLINED. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE KERF LOSSES WILL BE REDUCED BY A FACTOR OF 2.5 IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND ABOUT 3.3 IN THE LONG TERM.",

TO ACHIEVE SUPERIOR QUALITY, HOWEVER, PRESENTLY REQUIRES PRODUCTION METHODS WHICH RESULT IN RELATIVELY HIGH COST. A RESEARCH PROGRAM IS PROPOSED WHICH WILL ESTABLISH THE FOUNDATION FOR LOWER COST, HIGHER THROUGHPUT PRODUCTION ALTERNATIVES WHICH PRESERVE BIPOLAR QUALITY. THE STANDARD IMPLANTATION PROCESS RESULTS IN SIMOX MATERIAL WITH DEFECT DENSITIES OF ABOUT 10(9)/CM(2); IT IS KNOWN THAT SIMOX WITH LOWER DEFECT DENSITIES CAN BE PRODUCED USING IMPLANTATION TEMPERATURES OF 600 DEG C TO 700 DEG C. TO UTILIZE THE MAXIMUM POWER OF A HIGH CURRENT IMPLANTER SUCH AS AN NV-200, SPIRE HAS STUDIED FABRICATION OF SIMOX AT MUCH HIGHER IMPLANTATION TEMPERATURES: 900 DEG C TO 1000 DEG C (CURRENT DENSITY OF ABOUT 60 MICROAMPERES/CM(2)). RESULTS INDICATE THAT, TO FORM BURIED LAYERS WITH SUCH HIGH BEAM CURRENT, AN INITIAL LOWER TEMPERATURE IMPLANTATION (LOWER DOSE RATE) IS REQUIRED TO PRODUCE SIO(2) PRECIPITATES OR \"SEEDS\". PHASE I PROPOSES TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE THIS TWO STEP PROCESS BY 1. IMPLANTING A SMALL FRACTION OF THE TOTAL OXYGEN DOSE (ABOUT 1%) AT LOW TEMPERATURE TO GENERATE A FINE DISPERSION OF SIO(2) PRECIPITATES, FOLLOWED BY (2) IMPLANTATION OF THE OXYGEN BALANCE AT 750 DEG C-850 DEG C.",

PROGRAM EMPHASIS WILL BE ON PROVIDING SIMOX WAFERS TO A DESIGNATED RADIATION HARD ANALOG DEVICE FABRICATOR WHO WILL BUILD ANALOG CIRCUITS FOR TEST AND EVALUATION IN PERTINENT NEUTRON ENVIRONMENTS. SPIRE HAS DEVELOPED TWO METHODS OF REDUCING DISLOCATION DENSITY. THE FIRST PREVENTS FORMATION OF DISLOCATIONS, USING A MULTIPLE LOW DOSE IMPLANTATION AND HIGH TEMPERATURE ANNEALING PROCESS INSTEAD OF THE STANDARD SINGLE HIGH DOSE IMPLANTATION AND HIGH TEMPERATURE ANNEAL. MULTIPLE LOW DOSE IMPLANTATION REDUCES DISLOCATION DENSITY BY THREE TO FIVE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE. THE SECOND METHOD REDUCES THE DENSITY OF ALREADY FORMED DISLOCATIONS BY IMPLANTATION OF GE AND SUBSEQUENT SOLID PHASE EPITAXY REGROWTH; THIS DECREASES DISLOCATIONS AT THE SI SURFACE OF STANDARD SIMOX WAFERS BY TWO TO THREE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE.

DUE TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE FEW APPLICATIONS WHICH REQUIRE GOOD DETECTORS IN THIS WAVELENGTHREGION, NO HIGH PERFORMANCE DETECTORS ARE AVAILABLE. TWO SEMICONDUCTOR MATERIALS ARE PROMISING FOR YIELDING HIGH PERFORMANCE 2.1 M PHOTOVOLTAIC DETECTORS: HGCDTE AND INGAAS.

IBED FILMS EACH CAN BE GROWN AT RELATIVELY LOW TEMPERATURES COMPARED TO OTHER TECHNIQUES, ARE HIGHLY ADHERENT, FULL DENSE, PINHOLE-FREE, AND DO NOT SHOW THE COLUMNAR MICROSTRUCTURE COMMON TO OTHER LOW TEMPERATURE COATING PROCESSES. THE PROPOSED PHASE I RESEARCH WOULD INVESTIGATE IBED AS A MEANS OF DEPOSITING BULK-DENSITY AL(2)O(3) THIN FILMS ON SILICON (100) SUBSTRATES.

AN ACCURATE METHOD OFPERFORMING REMOTE INSPECTIONS IS THEREFORE NEEDED. THIS PROJECT ADDRESSES THESE MONITORING NEEDS WITH SURFACE LAYER ACTIVATION (SLA).

THE LOSS OF ACTIVITY, REMOTELY MEASUREDBY A GAMMA RAY DETECTION SYSTEM, IS USED TO DEDUCE THE AMOUNT OF SURFACE MATERIAL REMOVED WHILE ACTIVITY, REMOTELY MEASURED BY A GAMMA RAY DETECTION SYSTEM, IS USED TO DEDUCE THE AMOUNT OF SURFACE MATERIAL REMOVED WHILE OPERATING IN REAL TIME.

THIS METHOD WILL BE SUITABLY MODIFIED AND APPLIED TO THE ANALYSIS OF PALYTOXIN. DURING PHASE I, TWO COMPETITIVE ASSAY APPROACHES WILL BE DEVELOPED: THE FIRST HAS THE PALYTOXIN ANTIBODY BOUND TO THE MICROTITER WELL: THE SECOND HAS THE TOXIN ITSELF BOUND TO THE MICROTITER WELL. IN BOTH METHODS, THE SIGNAL WILL BE INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO THE AMOUNT OF PALYTOXIN IN THE SAMPLE. THE POLYCLONAL ANTIBODY IS HIGHLY SPECIFIC FOR PALYTOXIN. THE NOVEL LABEL IS A VERY STABLE, NON-ENZYMATIC LABEL WHICH GENERATES AN EASILY DETERMINED COLOR CHANGE. A MAJOR ADVANTAGE OF THE METHOD IS THE LABEL IN THE AB-FLIA. IT IS WELL SUITED TO AN ASSAY THAT CAN BE USED OUTSIDE OF STRICTLY CONTROLLED LABORATORY CONDITIONS AND CAN BE DETECTED IN MINUTE QUANTITIES. THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS A RAPID ULTRA-SENSITIVE ASSAY FOR PALYTOXIN THAT IS ROBUST ENOUGH TO BE USED IN THE FIELD TO DETECT PALYTOXIN EXPOSURE.",

IN PHASE I THE TWO EFFECTS WILL BE STUDIED INDEPENDENTLY WHILE IN PHASE II THE MUTUAL INTERACTION WILL BE CONSIDERED. THE THEORY TO STUDY THE RANDOM SCATTERING IS WELL DEVELOPED FOR CW RADIATION. KNOWN RESULTS WILL BE SUMMARIZED TO SHOW HOW APERTURE DISTRIBUTIONS MAY BE SYNTHESIZED TO OVERCOME DEFOCUSING OF THE RADOM MEDIUM. RESEARCH WILL BE UNDETAKEN TO SHOW IF THE SAME TECHNIQUES CAN BE APPLIED TO FOCUS-WAVE PULSES. THE THEORY TO TREAT THE NONLINEAR INTERACTION IS STILL NOT TOO WELL DEVELOPED EXCEPT FOR VERY SIMPLE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE INTERACTION.

        "abstract": "Abstract         PROPOSED HEREIN IS A PROGRAM TO DEVELOP AN IMPROVED METHOD FOR TURBINE BLADE DISK ATTACHMENTS. A DESIGN CONCEPT IS PRESENTED TO ALLOW EASY REMOVAL AND REPLACMENT OF BLADES, REDUCE THE MASS OF THE ATTACHMENT REGION, AND MAINTAIN THE STRUCTURAL RELIABILITY OF STANDARD FIR-TREE AND DOVETAIL ENTRY ROOT DESIGN. THE \"SPLIT ROOT\" CONCEPT COMBINES THE INSTALLATION FEATURES OF AN AXIAL TYPE BLADE ROOT, WITH THE RIGIDITY AND STRENGTH OF A LESS MASSIVE STRADDLE MOUNT ROOT. THE SPLIT TOOT BLADE IS FASTENED AXIALLY ON THE DISK, WITH DIRECT CONTACT BETWEEN ADJOINING BLADE ROOT SURFACES FOR INCREASED MATERIAL DAMPING. PINS INSERTED AXIALLY BETWEEN ADJOINING ROOT FACES MAINTAIN BLADE RIGIDITY, AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DAMPING. ADVANTAGES OF THE SPLIT ROOT DESIGN ARE PRESERVATION OF THE AXIAL ENTRY INSTALLATION PROCEDURE, REDUCE BLADE TOOT MASS WITHOUT LOSS OF STRENGTH OR RIGIDITY, INCREASED BLADE DAMPING, LOWER DYNAMIC STRESS, AND EXTENDED BLADE LIFE. BY REDUCING MASS AND INCREASING DAMPING, THE SPLIT ROOT DESIGN MAY ALSO ALLOW SIMPLIFICATION OF THE ATTACHMENT GEOMETRY, WHICH WILL FURTHER EASE INSTALLATION AND REMOVAL OF THE BLADES, AS WELL AS REDUCE THEIR ASSOCIATED MANUFACTURING COSTS.",

THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED USING A NOVEL CHIMERIC CONSTRUCTION/EXPRESSION VECTOR. THE VECTOR WILL ALLOW THE RAPID GENERATION OF FOUR CHIMERIC CONSTRUCTS, EACH HAVING A DIFFERENT TRANSITION SITEBETWEEN THE DNA SEQUENCES ENCODING THE 3'-5' EXONUCLEASE ACTIVITY OF THE KLENOW FRAGMENT AND THE DNA SEQUENCES ENCODING THE 5'-3' T3 DNA POLYMERASE ACTIVITY. THE CHIMERICPOLYMERASES WILL BE A USEFUL MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REAGENT IN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT REQUIRE A HIGH DEGREE OF PROCESSIVITY ANDFIDELITY DURING THE DNA POLYMERIZATION REACTION. POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS INVOLVE THE IMPROVEMENT OF SITE-SPECIFIC MUTAGENESIS REACTIONS, DNA SEQUENCING, AND AMPLIFICATION OF LARGE GENES. IN ADDITION TO ENGINEERING THESE HYBRID POLYMERASE CONSTRUCTS, THE METHODOLOGIES DEVELOPED IN PHASE I OF THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE A VALUABLE MODEL SYSTEM TO RESEARCHERS FOR FUTURE HYBRID PROTEIN CONSTRUCTIONS.

RELIABLE OPERATION WILL REQUIRE A MATERIAL POSSESSING HIGH STRENGTH, AS WELL AS HIGH ELECTRICAL AND THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY AND EXCELLENT FATIGUE CHARACTERISTICS. THE MATERIAL CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT FOR THIS APPLICATION IS AN EXPLOSIVELY BONDED LAMINATE OF COPPER BETWEEN TWO SHEETS OF STEEL. HOWEVER, FATIGUE TESTS HAVE SHOWN THAT THIS MATERIAL IS INCAPABLE OF ATTAINING THE FATIGUE SPECIFICATION OF 30,000 CYCLES AT A STRESS OF 443 MEGA PASCALS (MPA). AN ALTERNATIVE MATERIAL FOR THIS APPLICATION IS A CUNB MICROCOMPOSITE THAT DISPLAYS HIGH STRENGTH (1,020 TO 1,360 MPA), HIGH ELECTRICAL (65 TO 75% INTERNATIONAL ANNEALED COPPER STANDARD) AND THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY, AND EXCELLENT FATIGUE CHARACTERISTICS (190,000CYCLES AT 500 MPA). THUS FAR, THESE PROPERTIES HAVE BEEN ATTAINED ONLY IN SHEETS OF 0.05 CM THICKNESS. TO MEET THE CIT FULL SCALE THICKNESS OF 1.6 CM, CONSIDERABLE SCALE-UP OF THIS STRAIN DEPENDENT MATERIAL MUST OCCUR. THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF THESE PLATES IN PHASE I WOULD BE ASIGNIFICANT STEP TOWARD REALIZATION OF CIT AND ITS OBJECTIVES.",

THIS PROJECT WILL FABRICATE NB3SN MATERIALS USING THE CONVENTIONAL BRONZE-ROUTE PROCESS. THE MONOFILAMENT CORES WILL CONSIST OF TI-DOPED NB AROUND A NB CENTRAL CORE. THIS WILL PRODUCE A MORE UNIFORM NB3SN REACTION LAYER BY PROVIDING A HIGH SN DIFFUSION RATE IN THE OUTER REGIONS OF THE MONOFILAMENT.

IN THIS WORK, A FRACTION OF THE PORES IN ACTIVATED CARBON (SORBENT IN CURRENT INDUSTRIAL RESPIRATORS) WILL BE FILLED WITH A LOW VOLATILITY, NONTOXIC, POLAR, ORGANIC LIQUID (E.G., GLYCEROL). THE COMBINED ADSORPTION AND ABSORPTION IN THE MODIFIED CARBON WILL PROVIDE THE CAPABILITY OF SIMULTANEOUSLY REMOVING LOW-AND HIGH-BOILING-POINT TOXIC ORGANICS WITH VARYING DEGREES OF POLARITY FROM THE AIR IN AN INDUSTRIAL ENVIRONMENT. THE DOPANT WILL ALSO REDUCE THE TENDENCY FOR CAPILLARY CONDENSATION OF WATER AT HIGH RELATIVE HUMIDITIES. THE RESULT WOULD BE AN ALL-PURPOSE CHEMICAL CARTRIDGE, USEFUL FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF TOXIC GASES OVER A WIDE RANGE OF RELATIVE HUMIDITIES. THIS VERSATILE CARTRIDGE WOULD PROVIDE SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED PROTECTION FOR INDUSTRIAL WORKERS POTENTIALLY EXPOSED TO TOXIC GASES, THE COMPOSITION OF WHICH IS NOT NECESSARILY KNOWN.

PLANAR ARRAY INTERFEROMETRY CAN PROVIDE FINE RESOLUTION DIRECTION OF ARRIVAL (DOA) MEASUREMENTS SIMULTANEOUSLY FOR SIGNALS WITHIN A WIDE FIELD OF VIEW. HOWEVER, THE PROCESSING BURDEN IS ENORMOUS USING STANDARD PROCESSING ARCHITECTURES. FURTHERMORE, CHARACTERIZING A PARTICULAR DETECTED SIGNAL, FOR EXAMPLE MEASURING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY, WHEN OTHER SIGNALS ARE PRESENT WITHIN THE FIELD OF VIEW REQUIRES COMPLEX PROCESSING WHEN USING STANDARD METHODS. THIS PAPER PROPOSES AN OPTICAL FIBER PROCESSING ARCHITECTURE WHICH DRAMATICALLY INCREASES THE EASE WITH WHICH THE DOA OF THE SIGNALS CAN BE OBTAINED FROM PASSIVE RF PLANAR INTERFEROMETRIC ARRAYS AND TRIVIALIZES THE PROBLEM OF CHARACTERIZING THE RF ENERGY COMING FROM A PARTICULAR LOCATION. INCLUDED IN THE PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE IS A SUBSYSTEM USING OPTICAL PROCESSING TO ISOLATE RF ENERGY COMING FROM A PARTICULAR DIRECTION AND TO GENERATE THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY OF THE ISOLATED RF ENERGY. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS EFFORT IS TO ESTABLISH THE SPECIFIC DESIGN REQUIREMENTS AND TO DEFINE A BASIS FOR ASSESSING THE FEASIBILITY OF THE OPTICAL PROCESSING; TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND REFINE THE ARCHITECTURE AND ESTABLISH SYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS AND PARAMETER VALUES TO SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS; AND TO DETERMINE THE RISK AND EFFORT REQUIRED TO DEVELOP THE OPTICAL PROCESSOR.",

ADVANCES IN THE GENERATION AND SCANNING OF INTENSE ELECTRON BEAMS HAVE OPENED UP PREVIOUSLY IMPRACTICAL METHODS OF MINE DETECTION INVOLVING GAMMA-INDUCED ACTIVATION OF NITROGEN. LINACS CAPABLE OF ELECTRON ACCELERATION RESULTING IN ENERGY GAINS OF MORE THAN 5 MEV PER METER HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED. DETECTION AND LOCALIZATION OF A BURIED NON-METALLIC MINE WITHIN A FEW CM APPEARS POSSIBLE. RECENT DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPAGATION OF INTENSE ELECTRON BEAMS THROUGH AIR OPEN UP THE POSSIBILITY THAT REASONABLE LOCALIZATION OF A MINE FUSE WOULD PERMIT SUCH A BEAM TO AFFECT IGNITION WITH HIGH PROBABILITY. CONSERVATION ESTIMATES OF THE POWER DENSITY IMPLY THAT A 100 KW PULSE WITH A DURATION OF 1 SECOND, COVERING AN AREA OF 10 SQUARE CM WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO INITIATE THE SENSITIVE COMPONENTS IN A FUZE.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE AIRWAKE VELOCITY FIELD IN THE RECOVERY ENVELOPE FOR AVIATION-CAPABLE SHIPS IS EXTREMELY COMPLEX. TURBULENT VORTICES GENERATED BY THE SHIP'S SUPERSTRUCTURE CHANGE DIRECTION AND INTENSITY WITH THE MAGNITUDE AND DIRECTION OF THE WIND OVER DECK (WOD) AS WELL AS WITH THE PITCHING AND ROLLING MOTIONS OF THE SHIP. THE CURRENT PRACTICE FOR INSURING SAFE OPERATIONS WITH A PARTICULAR HELICOPTER/SHIP COMBINATION IS TO PERFORM DYNAMIC INTERFACE (DI) TESTING UNDER VARIOUS WOD AND SHIP'S MOTION CONDITIONS. THE PROCESS OF DI TESTING COULD BE EXPEDITED IF THE VELOCITIES IN THE AIRWAKE FIELD COULD BE ACCURATELY MEASURED, MODELED, AND EVEN PREDICTED AT VARIOUS WOD CONDITIONS. PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS TO MEASURE THE AIRWAKE FIELD AROUND SCALE MODELS OF SHIPS USING WIND TUNNELS HAVE PRODUCED QUESTIONABLE RESULTS. COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS HAS ALSO BEEN SUED TO PREDICT THE AIRWAKE FIELD, BUT IT REMAINS TO VALIDATE THE PREDICTIONS WITH FULL-SCALE MEASUREMENTS. REMOTE WIND SENSORS EMPLOYING LASER DOPPLER VELOCIMETRY OFFER PROMISE FOR MAPPING THE FULL-SCALE THREE-DIMENSIONAL SPATIALAND TIME-DEPENDENT AIRWAKE FIELD. TWO OBJECTIVES ARE ADDRESSED BY THIS PROPOSAL: (1) TO DEVELOP A PLAN FOR PROCESSING AND ANALYZING THREE-DIMENSIONAL AIRWAKE DATA COLLECTED WITHIN THE RECOVERY ENVELOP OF AN AIR-CAPABLE SHIP USING A REMOTE WIND SENSOR, AND (2) TO CONSIDER HOW THE PROCESSED DATA COULD BE USED IN ADVANCE OF DI TESTING FOR BOTH REAL-TIME AND NON-REAL-TIME MODELING AND ENGINEERING ANALYSIS OF AIRWAKE DISTURBANCES ON AIRCRAFT.",

EITHER ANTIGEN OR ANTIBODY IS COUPLED TO THE SURFACE OF THE BUOYANT MATRIX. CELLS BEARING ON THEIR SURFACE AN ANTIBODY OR ANTIGEN COMPLEMENTARY TO THE LIGAND ON THE MATRIX ARE ADDED TO A SUSPENSION OF THE MATRIX. CELLS THAT BIND TO THEMATRIX FLOAT TO THE SURFACE OF THE SUSPENSION BY VIRTUE OF THE BUOYANT PROPERTIES OF THE MATRIX. THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS APPROACH HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED, USING AS THE BUOYANT MATRIX MILK FAT GLOBULES (MFG'S). MFG'S ARE TINY SPHERES OF DENSELY PACKED LIPID SURROUNDED BY A PLASMA MEMBRANE. THEY ARE FOUND IN RAW MILK, MAKING THEM EXTREMELY COST EFFECTIVE. THE MFG'S FLOAT IN WATER, HAVE GLYCOPROTEINS ON THEIR SURFACE FOR THE COVALENT COUPLING OF ANTIGEN OR ANTIBODY, AND WHEN SETTLED, FORM A WHITE LAYER AT THE TOP OF THE REACTION TUBE. IT IS PLANNED TO TEST THE ABILITY OF ANTIBODY LINKED TO MFG TO SEPARATE CLONED CELL LINES, B AND T LYMPHOCYTE POPULATIONS, AND VARIOUS SUBPOPULATIONS FROM HETEROGENEOUS CELL MIXTURES ON THE BASIS OF THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF SPECIFIC ANTIGENS.",

AS THE EXACT AMINO ACID SEQUENCE OF THE ENVELOPE PROTEIN (GP160) ON HIV TYPES CAN VARY GREATLY, THE OVERALL SUCCESS OF SUCH AN APPROACH WILL DEPEND ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF VIRUS-NEUTRALIZING MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES (MOAB'S) THAT CAN RECOGNIZE HIGHLY CONSERVED FEATURES OF THE ENVELOPE. THIS PROJECT PRESENTS A PROCEDURE FOR THE PREPARATION OF A NOVEL ANTIBODY CHIMERA THAT MAY FULFILL THESE CRITERIA. THOUGH ESSENTIALLY A HUMAN GAMMA 1 KAPPA ANTIBODY, THE AMINO ACID SEQUENCE OF ONE OR BOTH PAIRS OF VARIABLE REGIONS(V REGIONS) IN THIS CHIMERA WILL BE REPLACED WITH THE SEQUENCE OF A SINGLE-PROTEIN DOMAIN (E1 DOMAIN) OF THE CD4 MOLECULE. CD4 IS THE CELLULAR RECEPTOR FOR HIV. THE E1DOMAIN OF CD4 IS PROBABLY SUFFICIENT TO EXPRESS FULL VIRUS BINDING. IT SHARES SIGNIFICANT STRUCTURAL HOMOLOGY WITH IMMUNOGLOBULIN V DOMAINS.

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE DESIREABLE PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF LEAD ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS WIDESPREAD USE IN WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS PLUMBING SYTEMS, EVEN THOUGH VERY LOW LEVELS OF LEAD MAY POSE A SIGNIFICANT HEALTH HAZARD AND CAUSE LEARNINGDISABILITIES IN CHILDREN. THOUGH MUNICIPAL WATER SUPPLIES GENERALLY HAVE VERY LOW LEAD LEVELS, THEY FREQUENTLY BECOME CONTAMINATED WITH LEAD FROM THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AND/OR DOMESTIC PLUMBING. PROPOSED ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY REGULATIONS WILL REDUCE THE PROBLEM THROUGH CORROSION CONTROL, BUT NOT ENTIRELY CURE IT. CLINOPTILOLITE ZEOLITE, A NAUTRALLY OCCURRING MINERAL WITH A HIGH ION-EXCHANGE CAPACITY, CAN SELECTIVELY REMOVE LEAD FROM WATER. CURRENT RESEARCH AT THE U.S. BUREAU OF MINES AND THE IDAHO NATIONAL ENGINEERING LABORATORY SHOWS THAT ION-EXCHANGE COLUMNS CONTAINING CLINOPTILOLITE CAN REDUCE LEAD LEVELS TO WELL BELOW THE DRINKING WATER STANDARD FROM RELATIVELY HIGH INITIAL CONCENTRATIONS. THIS, AND OTHER RESEARCH, INDICATES THAT CLINOPTILOLITE ZEOLITE MAY PROVIDE AN EFFECTIVE MEDIA FOR USE IN FILTERS TO TREAT DRINKING WATER. HOWEVER, DETAILED DATA ARE NEEDED TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE, LOW-COST FILTERS USING CLINOPTILOLITE FOR LEAD REMOVAL. MOST IMPORTANTLY, THIS STUDY WILL ADDRESS QUESTIONS SUCH AS THE CONTACT TIME NEEDED FOR LEAD REMOVAL, THE EFFECTIVE CAPACITY AT RELATIVELY HIGH FLOW RATES, AND PARAMETERS SUCH AS THE OPTIMUM PARTICLE SIZE TO MAXIMIZE EFFICIENCY WHILE MAINTAINING GOOD FLOW CHARACTERISTICS.",

USED ALONE, THE LOW WATER CAPACITIES OF PURE GLYCOLS AT LOW WATER PRESSURES RESULT IN UNACCEPTABLY LOW ABSORPTION CYCLE COEFFICIENTS OF PERFORMANCE (COPS). HOWEVER, IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT ADDING CERTAIN POLYMERS TO GLYCOLS RESULTS IN A THREEFOLD CAPACITY IMPROVEMENT AT LOW WATER VAPOR PRESSURES. GLYCOL-POLYMER-WATER SYSTEMS HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR COOLING COPS SIMILAR TO LIBR-WATER AND FOR OPERATING OVER A WIDER RANGE OF CONDITIONS WITHOUT CRYSTALLIZATION. THEY ARE ALSO NON-CORROSIVE. GLYCOL-POLYMER-METHANOL SYSTEMS COULD BE USED FOR BOTH HEAT PUMP AND COOLING APPLICATIONS, WOULD HAVE LOWER DISTILLATION ENERGY REQUIREMENTS AND HIGHER COPS, AND WOULD BE LESS TOXIC THAN WATER-AMMONIA. THERMODYNAMIC RELATIONSHIPS OF THE GLYCOL-POLYMER SYSTEM WITH WATER AND METHANOL REFRIGERANTS WILL BE DETERMINED DURING PHASE I USING A SARTORIUS MICROBALANCE.

THE MATERIAL USED IS UNIQUE BECAUSE ITS BULK AND SURFACE REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN SEPARATED AND DEVELOPED INDEPENDENTLY IN TWO DISTINCT MATERIALS. THE FINAL POLYMER POSSESSES OVERALL OPTIMIZED CHARACTERISTICS BY BLENDING OPTIMIZED SURFACE-ACTIVE COPOLYMERS INTO THE OPTIMIZED BULK MATERIAL. USING A PATENTED PROCESS FOR FABRICATION OF MULTILAYERED TUBING, 6-MM-DIAMETER VASCULAR GRAFTS WILL BE PRODUCED. THESE GRAFTS WILL BE TESTED BOTH IN VIVO AND IN VITRO. IN VITRO TESTING WILL INCLUDE COMPLIANCE, BURST STRENGTH, KINK RADIUS, ELONGATION, AND SUTURE PULLOUT STRENGTH. IN VIVO EVALUATION WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED USING 30-CM-LONG CONDUITS TO CREATE AN ARTERIOVENOUS (AV) FISTULA BETWEEN THEEXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY AND IPSILATERAL EXTERNAL JUGULAR VEIN. DIRECT AV FISTULAS WILL ALSO BE CONSTRUCTED. POLYTETRAFLUOROETHYLENE (PTFE) CONDUITS WILL SERVE AS COMPARISONS. SOME CONDUITS WILL BE PUNCTURED 6 TIMES WEEKLY FOR 12 WEEKS. EXPLANTED GRAFTS WILL BE RESUBJECTED TO THE IN VITRO TEST PROTOCOL AS WELL AS STANDARD MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THESE GRAFTS WILL HEAL INTO THE VASCULARSYSTEM AND PROVE MORE DURABLE THAN PTFE CONDUITS AS WELL AS PROVIDING FEATURES SUCH AS SELF-SEALING, DECREASED THROMBUS FORMATION, AND LESS INTIMAL HYPERPLASIA.",

THE KETOBUTYROLACTONES, WHICH ARE IMMUNOSTIMULATORY, WERE ASSESSED FOR THEIR UTILITY AS VACCINE ADJUVANTS. THE EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN EMPLOYED IMMUNIZATION WITH COMMERCIALLY PREPARED VACCINES TO TETANUS AND INFLUENZA, AND A SYNTHETIC PEPTIDE OF HIV-1, GP-41. THEVACCINES WERE ADMINISTERED IN EITHER SOLUBLE OR ALUM-ADSORBED FORMS, AND THE EFFECT OF TREATMENT WITH THE BUTYROLACTONES ON HUMORAL AND CELL-MEDIATED IMMUNE RESPONSESWAS ASSESSED. BECAUSE BUTYROLACTONES ARE ACTIVE ORALLY, THE CONCEPT OF AN ORAL ADJUVANT FOLLOWING VACCINATION WAS EVALUATED. A KETOBUTYROLACTONE (BL-009) WAS SELECTED AS A POTENTIAL ADJUVANT BASED ON ITS ABILITY TO STIMULATE BOTH HUMORAL AND CELL-MEDIATED IMMUNITY (CMI). BL-009, WHEN ADMINISTERED ORALLY, STIMULATED ANTIBODY FORMATION IN ANIMALS RECEIVING ALUM-ADSORBED TETANUS TOXOID AND INFLUENZA HEMAGGLUTININ. ORALLY ADMINISTERED BL-009 SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT ENHANCEMENT OF CMI RESPONSES OF MICE TO THE INTRAMUSCULARLY INJECTED, SOLUBLE HIV-1 PEPTIDE. THE HUMORAL RESPONSE TO THE PEPTIDE IN BOTH THE SOLUBLE AND ALUM-ADSORBED FORMS WAS ALSO ENHANCED. THESE RESULTS SUPPORT THE NEED FOR CONTINUED RESEARCH ON THE IMMUNOSTIMULATORY ACTIVITY OF BUTYROLACTONES IN COMBINATION WITH NEW VACCINES WITH EMPHASIS ON THOSE VACCINES UNDER DEVELOPMENT FOR THE PREVENTION OF AIDS.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         APPROACHES THAT INCREASE THE COEFFICIENT OF PERFORMANCE OF REFRIGERATOR SYSTEMS ARE SOUGHT CONSTANTLY. RECENT INTERESTHAS BEEN DIRECTED TOWARD THE USE OF HEAT PUMPS FOR REFRIGERATION AND AIR CONDITIONING BECAUSE THEY HAVE SHOWN PROMISE IN INCREASING PERFORMANCE AND LOWERING OPERATING COSTS. ONE HEAT PUMP SYSTEM THAT HAS SHOWN GREAT POTENTIAL IS BASED ON THE ABSORPTION AND DESORPTION OF HYDROGEN FROM METAL HYDRIDES. IN THIS SYSTEM, A LOW TEMPERATURE METAL HYDRIDE IS COUPLED TO A HIGH TEMPERATURE HYDRIDE, PERMITTING ENERGY TO BE EXTRACTED FROM THE SURROUNDINGS. A MAJOR ADVANTAGE OF THIS SYSTEM IS THAT THESE HEAT PUMPS OPERATE WITHOUT ANY MOVING PARTS, USING HYDROGEN AS THE WORKING FLUID IN A CLOSED CYCLE THAT CAN BE REPEATED INDEFINITELY. PERFORMANCE CAN BE INCREASED IN THESE THERMALLY DRIVEN HEAT PUMPS DURING TWO INSTANCES WHEN THE HEAT GENERATED DURING ABSORPTION OF HYDROGEN BY THE METAL HYDRIDE MUST BE REJECTED. IN BOTH OF THESE INSTANCES, THE REJECTION OF HEAT BY MEANS OF AN INNOVATIVE SCHEME WILL INCREASE THE RATE OF THE ABSORPTION PROCESS. IN ADDITION, THIS PROCESS CAN GREATLY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY THAT MUST BE SUPPLIED TO RAISE THE LOW TEMPERATURE HYDRIDE TO RE-START THE CYCLE. CONSEQUENTLY, THE HEAT PUMP'S OVER-ALL PERFORMANCE IS IMPROVED, MAKING IT MORE COMPETITIVE WITH STANDARD REFRIGERATOR AND AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEMS. THE OBJECTIVE OF PHASE I IS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES OF REFRIGERATOR HEAT PUMP DEVICES CAN BE OBTAINED USING AN INNOVATIVE SUBSYSTEM IN CONJUNCTION WITH TWO METAL HYDRIDES.",

THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH CORRELATION RELATIONSHIPS CAN BE AIDED THROUGH THE USE OF ANALYTICAL SIMILARITY METHODS.

IF A CLOSED LOOP SYSTEM WERE INSTALLED,THE OPTIMUM USAGE OF THE STEAM AND THE EFFECTIVE AND SAFE LAUNCHING OF VARIOUS AIRCRAFT WITH VARYING WEAPONS SUITES COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED.THE PRESENT SYSTEM RELIES ON A NOMOGRAM AND MANUAL SETTING OF A FIRST STAGE HYDRAULIC VALVE ORIFICE, WHICH CONTROLS A LARGE HYDRAULIC VALVE WHICH CONTROLS THE STEAM VALVE. THIS SYSTEM PROVIDES A CONSTANT FLOW, WHEREAS A VARIABLE FLOW RATE TO MATCH THE AIRCRAFT'S ACCELERATION AND SPEED WOULD BE MORE EFFICIENT. TREADWELL CORPORATION PRESENTLY PROVIDES A UNIQUE VALVE AND CLOSED LOOP ELECTRIC CONTROL SYSTEM FOR HIGH PRESSURE GAS FLOW CONTROL FOR USE ON U.S. NAVY NUCLEAR SUBMARINES. THIS CONTROL SYSTEM COULD BE MODIFIED TO PROVIDE CLOSED LOOP CONTROL OF HYDRAULIC FLUID FOR THE LAUNCHING OF AIRCRAFT. THE TREADWELL VALVE NEED ONLY BE MODIFIED TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY FLOW CONTROL OF HYDRAULIC FLUID, THE CONTROL CIRCUIT WOULD PROBABLY NOT HAVE TO BE MODIFIED SINCE IT PRESENTLY OPERATES FROM A PRESSURE SENSOR FEED BACK INPUT.",

UNIS WAS DESIGNED TO INCREASE KNOWLEDGE REGARDING URINARY INCONTINENCE AND TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CARE PLANS FOR THE ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT OF PATIENTS. URINARYINCONTINENCE IS A MAJOR PROBLEM FOR THE ELDERLY, PARTICULARLY IN THE NURSING HOME. PROVIDING EXPERT NURSE CONSULTATIONS WITH UNIS COULD OFFER A NEW TECHNOLOGICAL APPROACH TO MEETING THE EXISTING KNOWLEDGE DEFICITS OF PROFESSIONAL CAREGIVERS ABOUT URINARY INCONTINENCE. TWO PARALLEL STUDIES WILL BE PERFORMED WITH INCONTINENT PATIENTS AND NURSE CAREGIVERS. THE FREQUENCY OF INCONTINENT EPISODES, THE NURSE'S KNOWLEDGE, AND CARE PLAN DEVELOPMENT WILL BE MEASURED REPEATEDLY THROUGHOUT THE STUDY. THE ACCEPTABILITY OF THE SYSTEM BY NURSES WILL BE SURVEYED, AND CONSULTATIONS WITH UNIS WILL BE MONITORED. THE LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL FOR DEVELOPING EXPERT SYSTEM APPLICATIONS IN SEVERAL AREAS OF THE NURSING HOME. THE INTEGRATION OF EXPERT SYSTEMS IN A NURSING HOME INFORMATION SYSTEM COULD PROVIDE COST-EFFECTIVE, ONGOING EXPERT CONSULTATION FOR NURSES AND OTHER HEALTH-CARE PERSONNEL, ADMINISTRATORS, AND STATE AND FEDERAL REVIEWERS.",

A NOVEL APPROACH IS PROPOSED WHICH INVOLVES INCORPORATING LATENT HEAT OF FUSION OR PHASE CHANGE MATERIALS (PCMS) WITHIN A SYNTHETIC FIBER MATRIX FOR LATER CONVERSION INTO TEST FABRIC. AT THE PHASE CHANGE TEMPERATURE, PCMS ABSORB AND HOLD A HIGH QUANTITY OF HEAT DURING THE HEATING CYCLE WHICH MUST BE REMOVED FROM THE PCM BEFORE ITS TEMPERATURE CAN BEGIN TO CHANGE. WITH THE PROPER CHOICE OF PCM(S), A GLOVE INSERT FASHIONED FROM THIS MATERIAL COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THERMAL COMFORT BY PREVENTING THE TEMPERATURE EXCURSION OF THE HAND FROM TOO MUCH ABOVE OR BELOW THE PERCEIVED THERMAL COMFORT ZONE, THEREBY IMPROVING ASTRONAUT COMFORT AND EVA PERFORMANCE.

IN PHASE I WE WILL PREPARE A SERIES OF TTX CONJUGATE VACCINES TO PREPARE MURINE MABS THAT BIND TO VARIOUS REGIONS OF THE TOXIN MOLECULE. WE THUS HOPE TO IDENTIFY IMMUNOGENS SUITABLE FOR USE IN PREPARING HUMAN MONOCLONALS AGAINST TTX IN PHASE II. NEUTRALIZING HUMAN MABS ARE EXPECTED TO BE USEFUL FOR BOTH THE PROPHYLAXIS AND THERAPY OF TETRODOTOXIN POISONING AND COULD BE IMPORTANT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF POTENTIALLY PROTECTIVE ANALOGS. MABS PRODUCED IN PHASE I MAY ALSO BE USEFUL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF RAPID AND SENSITIVE ASSAYS FOR THE DETECTION OF TTX HAVING COMMERCIAL AND DEFENSE APPLICATIONS. MORE IMPORTANTLY, THESE STUDIES SHOULD ALSO LEAD TO IMPROVE METHODS OF PRODUCING HUMAN MABS AGAINST OTHER NONIMMUNOGENIC COMPOUNDS AND THUS COULD BE BROADLY APPLICABLE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF REAGENTS AND THERAPEUTICS FOR OTHER TOXINS AND LOW MOLECULAR WEIGHT DRUGS HAVING NARROW THERAPEUTIC INDICES.",

SIGNIFICANT COST REDUCTION COULD BE REALIZED IF AUTOMATION FOR LOW VOLUME ASSEMBLY AND REPAIR OPERATIONS COULD BE ACHIEVED. THE FIRST STEP TOWARD AN AUTOMATION GOAL IS TO DEVELOP A STANDARD ELECTRONIC COMPONENT PACKAGE (SECP) THAT INCORPORATES FEASURES THAT FACILITATE RELIABLE MECHANICAL HANDING (SPROCKET HOLES IMILAR TO MOTION PICTURE FILM) AS WELL AS PART PROTECTION, ORIENTATION, AND IDENTIFICATION (BAR CODE). THESE FEATURES WOULD PROMOTE AN AUTOMATIC STORAGE, RETRIEVAL, AND DELIVERY SYSTEM (SRDS) AND SEMI-FLEXIBLE AUTOMATIC ASSEMBLY EQUIPMENT. THE BAR CODE ATTACHED TO EACH STANDARDIZED PACKAGE WOULD PROVIDE THE PHYSICAL LINK BETWEEN THE COMPONENT (PAKAGE), THE EQUIPMENT SYSTEM CONTROL SOFTWARE AND THE MANAGEMENT CONTROL AND INFORMATION SYSTEM SOFTWARE (WORK SCHEDULES, INVENTORY CONTROL, JOB LABOR AND MATERIAL COST, ETC.). THE SECP CONCEPT IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SRDS OVERCOMES THE COMPLEXITIES OF MECHANICALLY GRASPING AND STORING A VAST ARRAY OF PARTS (EACH WITH A DIFFERENT GEOMETRY). THE TWO INVESTIGATORS HAVE A TOTAL OF 60(+) YEARS EXPERIENCE IN THE DESIGN OF AUTOMATIC MATERIAL HANDLING EQUIPMENT AND HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN ELECTRONIC ASSEMBLY FOR 15(+) YEARS.",

THE HEART OF THE TECHNOLOGY IS THE MICROSPHERE, A COLLAGEN-BASED MICROCARRIER THAT PERMITS CELL POPULATION DENSITIES IN EXCESS OF 10(8) CELLS/ML. THIS SYSTEM HAS ALREADY BEEN SUCCESSFULLY USED FOR THE LARGE-SCALE PRODUCTION OF SEVERAL PROTEIN THERAPEUTICS. THE GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TWOFOLD. FIRST, IT IS PLANNED TO INVESTIGATE THE USE OF MICROSPHERES AS A SUBSTRATE FOR THE GROWTH AND PRODUCTION OF THE HIV-1 GP-120 PROTEIN BY A GENETICALLY ENGINEERED HELA CELL. THE GOAL OF THIS PORTION OF THE PROJECT IS TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF USING THIS SYSTEM FOR GP-120 PRODUCTION AND TO OPTIMIZE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MATRIX TO PERMIT MAXIMUM CELL DENSITYAND PRODUCTIVITY. SECOND, A CONTINUOUS CULTURE MICROREACTORWILL BE DEVELOPED FOR USE WITH MICROSPHERES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH A SYSTEM IS ESSENTIAL TO CONDUCTING THIS RESEARCH BECAUSE OF THE INADEQUACY OF OTHER SMALL-SCALEBIOREACTORS FOR CONDUCTING RESEARCH ON MICROSPHERES.

(FOR INSTANCE, SEE SECTION 2.3.6, COMSEC ARCHITECTURE, OF \"COMMUNICATION SUPPORT SYSTEM (CSS) INTEGRATED SATCOM\", NAVSPAWAR, PD 50.) WE PROPOSE AN EXPERT SYSTEM MODELING CSS ARCHITECTURE AT USER EQUIPMENT, INTERFACE UNIT, PLATFORM LAN, LINK AND MULTI-NETWORK CONTROLLER, RED AND BLACK RADIO ROOM, AND RF MEDIA LEVELS, AND THE SECURITY ATTRIBUTES OF THEIR HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND INTERCONNECTION ELEMENTS. THE TOOL USES SECURITY RULES DERIVED FROM THE NATIONAL COMPUTER SECURITY CENTER \"RED BOOK\" TO DETERMINE THE SECURITY STATUS OF THE ARCHITECTURE. USING RULE PROCESSING WE CAN AUTOMATICALLY ASSIGN SECURITY ATTRIBUTES TO NETWORK ELEMENTS AND AID IN CERTIFICATION OR OPTIMIZATION. OUR PROPOSAL IS BASED ON A VIA-SAT IRAD PROTOTYPE MULTI-LEVEL SECURE NETWORKING EXPERT SYSTEM. IT IMPLEMENTS THE KNOWLEDGE-BASE AND SOME SECURITY RULES TO DEMONSTRATE FEASIBILITY OF THE CONCEPT. OUR PROPOSAL DESCRIBES A PHASE I CONTRACT TO EXTEND THE CAPABILITIES OF OUR IRAD TOOL, TAILORING THE KNOWLEDGE AND RULE BASE MODELS FOR CSS. DELIVERABLES FOR PHASE I INCLUDE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE MODELS AND A SOFTWARE DEMONSTRATION.",

BY CONTRAST, MANY A-B FILTERS CAN OFTEN BE SIMPLY IMPLEMENTED IN EITHER HARDWARE OR FIRMWARE, BUT AT SOME COST IN PERFORMANCE. NUMEROUS IMPROVEMENTS TO A-B FILTERS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO INCREASE PERFORMANCE, BUT THE ATTENDANT INCREASE IN PROCESSING IS OFTEN IGNORED. FOR BOTH KALMAN AND A-B FILTERS, THERE HAVE BEEN FEW ATTEMPTS TO COMBINE THE TAILORED IMPROVEMENTS TO PRODUCE A FILTER THAT IS PRECISELY MATCHED TO ITS REQUIREMENTS, AND WHICH INCLUDES CONSIDERATION OF PROCESSOR REQUIREMENTS IN THE PROCESSING OF MIXING AND MATCHING FILTER DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS. THIS RESEARCH EFFORT WILL PROVIDE A SUMMARY OF FILTER DESIGN OPTIONS THAT EMPHASIZE THE \"WHAT\" IS BEING ACCOMPLISHED OVER THE \"HOW\" OF ITS DERIVATION. SIMULATIONS OF DIFFERENT FILTERS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED USING EXISTING CODES TO PROVIDE THE TRACKING DATA. A METHODOLOGY IS PROPOSED THAT WILL ADD PROCESSOR REQUIREMENTS AS AN ADDITIONAL MEASURE OF MERIT, WHICH WILL BE USEFUL IN SELECTING OPTIONS FOR INCLUSION IN A DESIGN.",

AN INHERENT DISADVANTAGE WITH THE OM'S IS THAT THEIR DECOMPOSITION PRODUCES HYDROCARBON SPECIES WHICH CAN CONTRIBUTE CARBON IMPURITIES TO THE GROWING CRYSTAL. AN INHERENT DISADVANTAGE OF THE MH GASES IS THE DIFFICULTY OF STORING AND HANDLING TOXIC AND FLAMMABLE GASES SAFELY AT HIGH PRESSURES. FURTHERMORE, CERTAIN HYDRIDES ARE TOO UNSTABLE TO CONTEMPLATE STORAGE AS GASES AT AMBIENT TEMPERATURE, LEAVING NO APPARENT CHOICE EXCEPT THE OM OPTION. HOWEVER, WHERE THERE IS A CHOICE BETWEEN MH GASES AND OM LIQUIDS, THE MH'S (E.G. ASH[3], PH[3]) ARE STILL GENERALLY PREFERRED DUE TO THEIR HIGHER PURITY AND INHERENT ABSENCE OF CARBON CONTAMINANTS. POINT-OF-USE MH GAS GENERATORS ARE PROPOSED TO OVERCOME LIMITATIONS OF BOTH CLASSES OF CVD PRECURSORS. IN ADDITION TO THE OBVIOUS CASES OF ASH(3) AND PH(3) GENERATORS, THE POSSIBILITY OF GENERATING MORE UNUSUAL AND LESS STABLE HD'S LIKE H(2)TE AND GA(2)H(6) APPEARS FEASIBLE. DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH MH SOURCE WOULD EXPAND THE OPTIONS FOR MOCVD PRECURSORS FOR DEPOSITION OF HG/CDTE AND GAAS CRYSTALS. THE PHASE I OBJECTIVE IS TO EVALUATE ALTERNATIVE CHEMISTRIES FOR A POINT-OF-USE GENERATOR AND TO DETERMINE THE CONSTRAINTS INVOLVED IN GETTING A GAS STREAM CONTAINING H(2)TE INTO A CVD REACTOR WITHOUT PREMATURELY DECOMPOSING THE H(2)TE COMPONENT. THE CONTEMPLATED SOURCE CHEMISTRIES WOULD ALSO ELIMINATE THE STORAGE OF EXTREME TOXICS AT HIGH PRESSURE.",

A METAL LAYER IS DEPOSITED TO FORM AN ELECTRET. ANOTHER METAL LAYER WAFER IS ALSO ETCHED TO FORM A DIAPHRAGM, BUT OF DIFFERENT THICKNESS. THE TWO WAFERS ARE BONDED TOGETHER TO YIELD A BATCH OF ELECTRET HYDROPHONES. SOUND WAVES PRODUCE DIFFERENT DEFORMATIONS IN THE TWO BACK-TO-BACK DIAPHRAGMS, HENCE, GENERATE A DIFFERENTIAL ELECTRICAL OUTPUT SIGNAL. A RESISTOR CONNECTED ACROSS THE METAL ELECTRODES YIELDS A SIGNAL WHEN THE SOUND WAVES IMPINGE ON THE LAYERED HYDROPHONE DIAPHRAGM.",

THE WORKING MEDIUM IS HYDROGEN, WHICH SHUTTLES BETWEEN TWO HEAT EXCHANGERS WHOSE SURFACES ARE COATED WITH METAL HYDRIDE. A TECHNIQUE FOR COATING A METAL SURFACE WITH A METAL HYDRIDE USING SILICONE RUBBER (WHICH HAS A HIGH PERMEABILITY FOR HYDROGEN) AS THE BINDER HAS ALREADY BEEN DEVELOPED. THIS COATED SURFACE WAS CYCLED THROUGH 2,900 CYCLES OF HYDRIDING AND DEHYDRIDING. THERE WAS A GRADUAL LOSS OF CAPACITY TO ABSORB HYDROGEN, CAUSED PROBABLY BY TRACES OF WATER IN THE HYDROGEN. WATER IS A DECOMPOSITION PRODUCT OF SILICONE RUBBER. IF THE HYDROGEN COULD BE KEPT ABSOLUTELY DRY, DECOMPOSITION SHOULD BE ARRESTED AND CAPACITY SHOULD REMAIN CONSTANT. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO PROVE THIS. IN PHASE I A PROTOTYPE HEAT PUMP WILL BE BUILT AND CYCLED AT LEAST 3,000 TIMES. A MOLECULAR SIEVE WILL BE USED TO CAPTURE THE WATER AND KEEP THE HYDROGEN DRY. EXISTING AUTOMOBILE AIR CONDITIONERS INCREASE ENGINE LOAD BY 5 TO 10 HP AND USE CHLOROFLUOROCARBONS (CFCS) AS THE WORKING MEDIUM.

IT HASBEEN ESTABLISHED THAT PERIOVULATORY CERVICAL MUCUS VOLUME AND CONSTITUTION ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO ESTROGEN LEVELS IN WOMEN. AS OVULATION NEARS AND FOLLICULAR ESTROGEN PRODUCTION INCREASES, THE CERVICAL MUCUS IN THE VAGINA UNDERGOES A NOTICEABLE SHIFT IN VISCOSITY AND ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY. THE PROBE MEASURES THE ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE OF THE VAGINAL MUCUS AND THE SURROUNDING TISSUE. THE USER MAY THEN CHART THE CHANGE IN VAGINAL CONDUCTIVITY, THE NADIROF WHICH FORECASTS IMMINENT OVULATION. THE SYSTEM HAS ALREADY PROVEN USEFUL AND EFFECTIVE IN ANIMAL BREEDING PROGRAMS. IT IS THE INTENTION OF THIS STUDY TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF USING THE SYSTEM IN WOMEN. NATURAL FAMILY PLANNING, TIMING OF ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION, AND MANY OTHER FERTILITY CLINIC FUNCTIONS WOULD BENEFIT GREATLY FROM AN INEXPENSIVE, RELIABLE, AND EASY-TO-USE OVULATION DETECTOR. TWENTY SPONTANEOUSLY OVULATING WOMEN OF VARIOUS AGES WILL TEST THE PROBE AGAINST A BACKGROUND OF OTHER ACCEPTED (BUT MORE EXPENSIVE AND CUMBERSOME) OVULATION PREDICTION ASSAYS SUCH AS ULTRASOUND, BBT, AND LH ASSAYS.",

THIS STUDY IS PROPOSED TO DEVELOP AN ULTRASONIC TOMOGRAPHY TECHNIQUE FOR MAPPING THE POROSITY DISTRIBUTION IN RESINMATRIX COMPOSITES. THE BASIS OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH IS TO USE THE TOMOGRAPHICAL PRINCIPLE TO EXTRACT THE LOCAL PROROSITY LEVEL FROM THE AVERAGE VELOCITY OR ATTENUATION VALUES MEASURED ALONG MANY SETS OF PARALLEL PROPAGATION PATHS. RELIABLE EMPIRICAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN VELOCITY OR ATTENUATION AND POROSITY WILL BE FIRST ESTABLISHED FOR SAMPLES OF UNIFORM POROSITY. THE INVESTIGATION WILL NOT BE RESTRICTED ONLY TO LONGITUDINAL-WAVE NORMAL INCIDENCE, BUT WILL ALSO INCLUDE SHEAR-WAVE AND WAVEGUIDE MODES TO BE EXCITED AT OBLIQUE INCIDENCE. THE DEVELOPED TECHNIQUE WILL THEN BE TESTED ON SAMPLES OF ARBITRARY POROSITY DISTRIBUTION TO DETERMINE ITS TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY. THE FINAL OUTPUT IS EXPECTED TO BE A SPATIAL MAPPING OF THE POROSITY DISTRIBUTION.",

THE NUMBER OF HTLV-I SEROPOSITIVE BLOOD DONORS IN THE UNITED STATES IS BECOMING ALARMINGLY HIGH, RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT CONTAMINIATION OF TRANSFUSABLE BLOOD PRODUCTS. DEVELOPMENT OF A HIGHLY SENSITIVE AND HIGHLY SPECIFIC BLOOD-SCREENING ASSAY FOR HTLV-I ANTIBODIES IN SERUM HAS BEEN HINDERED BY LIMITING QUANTITIES OF CERTAIN VIRAL PROTEINS, INCLUDING THE MOST IMMUNOGENIC, WHICH IS ENVELOPE PROTEIN. THE PHASE I STUDY OUTLINES A STRATEGY FOR EXPRESSING SELECTED PROTEINS, AS WELL AS THE ENTIRE ENVELOPE PROTEIN, USING SYNTHETIC DNA CODING SEQUENCES. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THIS APPROACH WILL ALLOW THESE POLYPEPTIDES TO BE EXPRESSED AT HIGH LEVELS IN E. COLI. THE EXPRESSED POLYPEPTIDES WILL BE ANALYZED BIOCHEMICALLY AND EVALUATED FOR THEIR ABILITY TO DETECT ANTIBODIES TO HTLV-I IN HUMAN SERA. IN PHASE II, PROMISING CANDIDATE ENVELOPE POLYPEPTIDES WILL BE USED TO CONFIGURE AN ENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOASSAY (EIA) TO DETECT ANTIBODIES TO HTLV-1 IN HUMAN SERA. THE EIA WILL BE EVALUATED FOR SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY USING SERA FROM A LARGE NUMBER OF NORMAL AND INFECTED INDIVIDUALS. IT IS ENVISAGED THAT A COMPLEMENTARY SET OF RECOMBINANT-DERIVED HTLV-I PROTEINS WILL BE CONFIGURED INTO A HIGH-QUALITY BLOOD-SCREENING ASSAY FOR EXPOSURE TO THIS VIRUS.",

A SIMPLE TELESCOPE (OPTICAL AND/OR IR) IS PLANNED AS A PAYLOAD. IMAGES WILL BE SENT IN REAL TIME TO THE GROUND FORCES FOR THEIR IMMEDIATE USE. A MOTOR VEHICLE (VAN) WITH A PARABOLIC DISH WOULD SERVE AS A GROUND RECEIVING/CONTROL STATION. THE SPACECRAFT COULD BE CONSIDERED AS A \"THROW AWAY\" TYPE SYSTEM. THE PEGASUS IS PLANNED TO BE USED AS A LAUNCH VEHICLE. MORE THAN ONE SPACECRAFT WILL BE NEEDED DEPENDING ON THE NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS PER DAY REQUIRED. IN ADDITION, IF ONE SHOULD FAIL, ANOTHER COULD BE LAUNCHED A SHORT TIME THEREAFTER. THIS ALSO REQUIRES THAT MORE THAN ONE AIRCRAFT (SIMILAR TO THE B-52, 0008) WOULD HAVE TO BE EQUIPPED WITH A PEGASUS-TYPE LAUNCH SYSTEM. THE PEGASUS IS ABLE TO LAUNCH A SPACECRAFT OF ABOUT 1 M IN DIAMETER AND 1.7 M IN HEIGHT, HAVING A MASS OF ABOUT 150 KG INTO A 900 KM POLAR OR 220 KG INTO A 900 KM EQUATORIAL ORBIT.",

WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE THE PARALLEL IMPLEMENTATION AND BENCHMARKING OF MULTISENSOR AND PARALLEL ROBOTIC/AUTONOMOUS TASKS INVOLVING THE USE OF SENSORS SUCH AS VIDEO, RANGE, PROXIMITY, TOUCH, FORCE, AND TORQUE. THE INNOVATION IN THIS PROJECT IS THE PARALLEL MULTISENSING AS WELL AS THE PARALLEL AND PROCESSINGOF SENSORY CUES TO ALLOW FAST IDENTIFICATION OF OBJECTS IN VARIABLY STRUCTURED OR UNSTRUCTURED WORKSPACES TO PERFORM REALISTIC ROBOTIC TASKS THAT REQUIRE MULTISENSOR FUSION. THE NEED FOR THIS SENSORY AND COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY CUTS ACROSS THE BOARD OF NASA ACTIVITIES INCLUDING DEPLOYMENT, MAINTENANCE, AND REPAIR MISSIONS. THE EQUIPMENT NECESSARY FOR THE EXECUTION OF THIS PROJECT IS IN PLACE. PERCEPTICS HAS RECENTLY INTEGRATED ONE OF THE LARGEST MASSIVELY PARALLEL COMPUTERS IN THE NATION: A 1024-PROCESSOR NCUBE HYPERCUBE. THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HAS A VERSATILE AND COMPLETE ROBOTIC WORKSTATION EQUIPPED WITH ALL THE SENSORS NECESSARY FOR THIS PROJECT. AS A RESULT, THE CHANCES OF TECHNICAL SUCCESS AND LIKELIHOOD OF COMMERCIALIZATION OF THE OUTCOME OF THIS PROJECT ARE HIGH.",

THIS SYSTEMCONSISTS OF A PULSED LASER TRANSMITTER AND AN ACOUSTIC RECEIVER, BOTH OPERATED IN THE AIR. THE LASER BEAM IS FOCUSED TO A SMALL SPOT ON THE SURFACE OF THE GROUND. STRONG ABSORPTION OF THE LASER ENERGY AT THE SURFACE LIMITS PENETRATION OF THE BEAM TO A FEW WAVELENGTHS. INSTANT EVAPORATION OF SURFACE MOLECULES TAKES PLACE IF THE PEAK POWER DENSITY OF THE LASER SPOT ON THE SURFACE IS SUFFICIENTLY INTENSE. THE SUPERHEATED STEAM SUBSEQUENTLY EXPLODES, CREATING AN ACOUSTIC FIELD WHICH PROPAGATES THROUGH THE MEDIUM AND IS REFLECTED AT THE MEDIA INTERFACE. AN ACOUSTIC RECEIVER DETECTS THE REFLECTED SOUND FROM THE INTERFACE. PRECISE TIMING OF THESE SIGNALS MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO ACCURATELY MEASURE THE THICKNESS OF THE GIVEN MEDIUM. THE REFLECTIONS WOULD ALSO REVEAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MEDIUM. INITIAL ICE FIELD MEASUREMENTS PROVED THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS CONCEPT FOR MEASURING 1 METER THICK ICE USING A CO2 LASER OPERATING IN THE INFRARED PORTION OF THE SPECTRUM (10.6 UM). THE EMPHASIS OF THE PROPOSED PROGRAM ISTO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF USING A ND:YAG LASER OPERATING IN THE NEAR INFRARED REGION (1.06 UM) TO GENERATE ACOUSTIC PULSES IN VARIOUS MEDIA INCLUDING WATER, ICE, SNOW,AND SOIL.
