THE METHOD PROPOSED USES A SPECIAL STAPLER AND CONFIGURATION OF STAPLES WHICH MINIMIZESBLOOD CONTACT WITH THE STAPLES, DOES NOT RESTRICT THE FLOW OF BLOOD, AND PREVENTS LEAKAGE. DUE TO THE CONTROLLED METHOD OF APPLICATION, IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE QUALITY OF THE ANASTOMOSIS AND ITS LIFE WILL BE COMPARABLE WITH CURRENTMANUAL METHODS. THE STAPLING PROCEDURE HAS THE POTENTIAL OFREDUCING THE AMOUNT OF TIME REQUIRED FOR THE ANASTOMOSIS, THUS SHORTENING THE DURATION OF CROSS CLAMPING OR BIPASS, RESULTING IN IMPROVED PATIENT RECOVERY, REDUCED MORBIDITY, AND LOWER COST OF THE PROCEDURE. CURRENTLY AVAILABLE STAPLERS ARE DESIGNED FOR USE IN THE GASTRONINTESTINAL TRACTAND ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR VASCULAR SURGERY. ONE DEVICE HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY REPORTED TO BE USEFUL FOR END-TO-END ANASTOMOSIS OF SMALL VESSELS IN THE 1 TO 4 MM CALIBER, BUD NO DEVICE IS AVAILABLE FOR USE ON LARGER VESSELS.",

WHEN COMBINED COHERENTLY ON RECEIVE VIA ADAPTIVE SPACE-TIME PROCESSING, THE (SDCA) WITH IT'S ADDITIONAL SPATIAL DEGREES OF FREEDOM (DOF) PROVIDES A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE APERTURE OVER WHAT IS AVAILABLE WITH A SINGLE TRANSMIT BEAM. SBR APPLICATION - RADARS IN ORBIT OFTEN REQUIRE MULTIPLE DOF ON RECEIVE IN ORDER TO DETECT LOW SPEED TARGETS IMBEDDED IN MAINBEAM CLUTTER. THESE DOF TYPICALLY TAKE THE FORM OF SUB-ARRAYS FOR CORPORATE FEED ANTENNAS OR OVERLAPPING RECEIVE BEAMS WITH SPACE FED LENS ARRAYS. OPTIMUM ADAPTIVE SPACE-TIME PROCESSING (A GENERALIZATION OF DPCA) STILL RESULTS IN LOSSES FOR LOW VELOCITY TARGETS RESULTING IN MINIMUM DETECTABLE TARGET VELOCITIES MDV THAT ARE INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO THE APERTURE SIZE. ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT THE SDCA INCREASES THE EFFECTIVENESS APERTURE BY 40% RESULTING IN A 40% REDUCTION IN THE MDV. A SDCA WITH ONLY TWO SIMULTANEOUS TRANSMIT BEAMS, EACH WITH A DIFFERENT CODING, AND TWO RECEIVE BEAMS, ALLOWS DE-COUPLING OF 4 ROUND TRIP PATHS.

THIS RESEARCH IS IMPORTANT IN HIGH-ENERGY PHYSICS FOR THE DETECTION AND IDENTIFICATION OF THESE PARTICLES. THE RESEARCH CAN ALSO RESULT IN A PARTICLE-ENERGY DETECTOR FOR BEAM DIAGNOSTICS FOR BOTH HIGH-REPETITION RATE AND SINGLE-PULSE HIGH-CURRENT ACCELERATORS. THE DEVICE WOULD BE LOW COST AND WOULD OPERATE INSTITU WHILE CAUSING LITTLE OR NO PERTURBATION TO THE BEAM. WE WILL SHOW THAT THE ANGLE AT WHICH SOFT X-RAYS ARE EMITTED FROM AN ELECTRON CROSSING A PERIODIC FOIL STACK DEPENDS UPON THE ELECTRON'S ENERGY. ACCORDINGLY, AN ACCURATE DETERMINATION OF THAT ANGLE WILL IDENTIFY THE PARTICLE'S ENERGY. A SOFT-X-RAY LINEAR-DIODE ARRAY WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE THE ANGLE OF EMISSION ON A PULSE-TO-PULSE BASIS. THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR AND HIS COLLEAGUES WERE THE FIRST TO OBSERVE COHERENT TRANSITION RADIATION IN THE SOFT-X-RAY REGION OF THE SPECTRUM (1 TO 3 KEV). A BEAMLINE IS AVAILABLE FOR THIS WORK.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         THERE IS A NEED FOR A CORONARY-ARTERY DISEASE SCREENING METHOD NOT REQUIRING THE RISK OF AN ARTERIAL CATHETER. DIGITAL-SUBTRACTION RADIOGRAPHS USING IODINE-K-EDGE SUBTRACTION SUFFER FROM LOW X-RAY INTENSITIES AND REQUIRE LARGE IODINE CONCENTRATIONS PRECLUDING NON-INVASIVE TECHNIQUES. BRIGHTER X-RAY SOURCES ARE NEEDED. WE PROPOSE TO CONDUCT AN EVALUATION OF METAL OXIDES AS CHARACTERISTIC-LINE X-RAY EMITTERS. TWO TYPES OF DEVICES WILL BE CONSIDERED:(1) A HIGH-CURRENT PULSED X-RAY GUN WITH A METAL-OXIDE-COATED THIN-TARGET WINDOW, (2) A COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE X-RAY TUBE WITH A MODIFIED METAL-OXIDE-COATED ROTATING ANODE. THESE SOURCES ARE EXPECTED TO PRODUCE A USEFUL FLUX FOR K-EDGE DICHROMOGRAPHY OF APPROXIMATELY 50 TIMES GREATER THAN THAT OF FILTERED BREMSSTRAH-LUNG. WE HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED A COMPUTER SIMULATION OF IODINE-K-EDGE DICHROMOGRAPHY WHICH DETERMINES THE X-RAY FLUX NEEDED FROM IMAGING WITH A PARTICULAR X-RAY-DETECTOR SYSTEM. THIS SIMULATION TOGETHER WITH AN ESTIMATE OF THE CHARACTERISTIC-LINE X-RAY PRODUCTION OF OUR SOURCES, INDICATE THAT IODINE-K-EDGE DICHROMOGRAPHY IS POSSIBLE. WE WILL HAVE AT OUR DISPOSAL CRITICAL RESEARCH FACILITIES OF VARIAN ASSOCIATES, THE STANFORD LINEAR ACCELERATOR CENTER, AND ADELPHI TECHNOLOGY INC. THIS INCLUDES X-RAY DETECTION EQUIPMENT, X-RAY SOURCES, AND VAPOR-DEPOSITION FACILITIES. WE HAVE DEVELOPED A DIGITAL X-RAY-IMAGING SYSTEM WHICH IS ALSO AVAILABLE FOR THIS WORK. ADELPHI TECHNOLOGY INC. HAS EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE DEVELOPING ADVANCED X-RAY SOURCES FOR MEDICAL, SCIENTIFIC, AND INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS. A MEDICALDIAGNOSTIC IMAGING SYSTEM BASED UPON THE CHARACTERISTIC-LINESOURCE BEING DEVELOPED HERE PROMISES A MODERATE-COST NON-INVASIVE METHOD FOR SCREENING ATHEROSCLEROSIS.",

MANY OF THESE COMPOUNDS HAVE LOW DENSITIES AND VERY HIGH STRENGTHS AND, THEREFORE, ARE OF INTEREST FOR HIGH TEMPERATURE AEROSPACE AND SPACE STRUCTURE APPLICATIONS. HOWEVER,CONVENTIONAL PROCESSING OF INTERMETALLIC COMPOUNDS SUFFERS SEVERE LIMITATIONS: REACTIONS WITH CONTAINERS, POROSITY, CONTAMINATION OF POWDER SURFACES, AND COMPOSITIONAL INHOMOGENEITIES. RECENT WORK ON LOW TEMPERATURE CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION (CVD) OF METALS FROM ORGANOMETALLIC COMPOUNDS SUGGESTS THE POSSIBILITY OF FABRICATING CERTAIN INTERMETALLIC COMPOUNDS BY CVD. BECAUSE ORGANOMETALLIC CVD OPERATES AT LOW TEMPERATURE, EMPLOYS HIGHLY PURE STARTING MATERIALS, DEPOSITS MATERIAL UNIFORMLY, AND REQUIRES COMPARATIVELY LITTLE MATERIALS HANDLING, IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS DESCRIBED ABOVE. IN THE PROPOSED PHASE I STUDY, APPROACHES FOR CHEMICALLY VAPOR DEPOSITING TITANIUM ALUMINIDE WILL BE EXAMINED. SUITABLE SOURCE REAGENTS FOR TITANIUM AND ALUMINUM WILL BE EXPLORED AND THEN SYNTHESIZED.

THE PROPOSAL IS FOR A COMBINED EXPERIMENTAL, ANALYTICAL, AND MODELING PROGRAM TO DEVELOP A MECHANISTIC UNDERSTANDING AND MODEL OF FUEL THERMAL STABILITY. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE PROGRAM CARRIED THROUGH PHASE II IS THE ABILITY TO PREDICT, GIVEN THE COMPOSITION OF THE FUEL AND THE CONDITIONS IN THE FUEL LINES AND ENGINE, THE DECOMPOSITION OF THE LIQUID, THE FORMATION OF GUMS IN THE LIQUID AND THE DEPOSITION OF SURFACES. IN ADDITION, WE EXPECT THAT AN ON-BOARD FUEL STABILITY MONITOR CAN BE DEVELOPED BASED ON A PORTABLE FT-IR INSTRUMENT AND A SPECIALLY CONSTRUCTED CELL. THE PROGRAM WOULD UTILIZE SPECIALIZED ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES FOR HYDROCARBON FUELS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AT ADVANCED FUEL RESEARCH, (AFR), INC. AND SRI INTERNATIONAL (A SUBCONTRACTOR). IT WOULD ALSO EMPLOY SEVERAL MODELING TECHNIQUES FOR HYDROCARBON THERMAL DEGRADATION, WHICH HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AT AFR. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PHASE I PROGRAM IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE VALUE OF THESE SPECIALIZED ANALYTICAL AND MODELING TECHNIQUES DEVELOPED AT AFR AND SRI FOR FOLLOWING THE PROGRESS OF FUEL THERMAL DEGRADATION. IN PHASE II, A WIDER RANGE OF FUELS AND CONDITIONS WOULD BE INVESTIGATED AND THE DETAILED MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION WOULD OCCUR. THE PHASE II EFFORT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE ON-BOARD FT-IR DIAGNOSTIC INSTRUMENT.",

THESE NEW YBACUO (YBA[2]CU[3[O[7-X]) MATERIALS OFFER THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE THESE MATERIALS AS DETECTORS MORE CONVENIENTLY THAN THE \"CLASSICAL\" SUPERCONDUCTORS. THE LARGER ENERGY GAP OF THESE NEW HIGH T(C) MATERIALS ALSO PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FABRICATE JOSEPHSON JUNCTION DETECTORS CAPABLE OF SENSING OPTICAL RADIATION AND MUCH LOWER WAVELENGTHS, OFFERING NEW COMPETITION TO PREVIOUS SEMICONDUCTOR IR DECTORS IN THE 10 TO 100 MICROMETER REGION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PHASE I AND PHASE II PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP I SENSOR BASED ON GRINY JOSEPHSON JUNCTIONS IN YBACUO-TYPE SUPERCONDUCTORS. THE APPROACH OFFERED IN PHASE I IS TO USE BULK YBACUO MATERIALS TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF USING THESE GRAINY MATERIALS AS IR DETECTORS. PHASE II WOULD CONCENTRATE ON OPTIMIZING THE PERFORMANCE AND TESTING THESE DEVICES BASED ON THE RESULT OF PHASE I. THEY ARE, IN PRINCIPLE, READILY FABRICATED (BY VIRTUE OF THEIR NATURAL GRAININESS) AND ARE VIEWED TO BE A MOST ATTRACTIVE CHOICE FOR DEVELOPMENT USING THE NEW HIGH T(C) MATERIALS.",

ITS CONCENTRATION IN THE ATMOSPHERE IS RISING DUE TO ANTHROPOGENIC SOURCES RELATED TO AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY AND THE BURNING OF COAL AND HEAVY FUEL OIL. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD EVALUATE AND DEVELOP A NEW, RELIABLE, COST EFFECTIVE, RUGGED AND NONINTRUSIVE METHOD OF MEASURING N2O IN EITHER THE FREE ATMOSPHERE OR IN COMBUSTION EXHAUST GAS STREAMS. THE PROPOSED N2O MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUE IS BASED ON A DUAL LINE INFRARED LASER EMISSION FROM A PULSE DISCHARGE THROUGH GASEOUS XENON. THIS MEASUREMENT METHOD COULD ALSO BE INTEGRATED WITH EDDY CORRELATION FLUX MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES TO YIELD BOTH CONCENTRATION AND VERTICAL FLUX MEASUREMENTS FOR N2O FROM AIRBORNE OR GROUND BASED PLATFORMS.",

OBSERVABLES IN THE OPTICAL WAVE LENGTHS INCLUDE SPRAY, FOAM, WAKES AND SURFACE WAVE PATTERNS. IT IS NOTED THAT MODERN TECHNIQUES EXIST TO VIRTUALLY ELIMINATE SURFACE WAVE MAKING WHICH WOULD THEN ELIMINATE ALL THE ABOVE OPTICAL OBSERVABLES BY APPLYING A SPECIALLY DESIGNED FAIRING TO MAST. RECENT RESEARCH HAS INDICATED THAT SPECIALLY CONTOURED HORIZONTAL FINS CAN THEORETICALLY ELIMINATE WAVE DRAG FROM A BODY OF FINITE DISPLACEMENT. THIS RADICAL AND INNOVATIVE CONCEPT WHICH WILL BE APPLIED HERE. IT HAS LONG BEEN KNOWN THAT MASSIVE ASPIRATION, SUCTION AT THE BOW AND BLOWING AT THE STERN, CAN MAKE A BODY EFFECTIVELY OF ZERO THICKNESS AND WAVELESS. THE FLOW FEATURES OF THESE FAIRINGS CAN BE DESIGNED AND PREDICTED WITH FAIR ACCURACY BY VARIOUS COMPUTER CODES. THE ASPIRATION METHODS ARE APPLICABLE OVER A CRUISE SPEED RANGE BY ACTIVE CONTROL OF ASPIRATION AS FROUDE NUMBER VARIES WHILE THE ANGLE OF ATTACK OF THE FIN MAY BE VARIED WITH SPEED FOR THE SAME PURPOSE. A THREE PART TECHNICAL PROGRAM IS PROPOSED INCLUDING: DEFINITION OF OBSERVABLES, DESIGN OF INNOVATIVE WAVELESS FAIRINGS, EVALUATION OF FAIRINGS AND SELECTION OF BEST CANDIDATES. PHASE II WILL INVOLVE THE ACTUAL TEST OF WAVELESS FAIRINGS.",

THESE PROCEDURES USE RADIOLABELED HYBRIDIZATION TECHNIQUES AND AUTORADIOGRAPHY TO ACHIEVE THE REQUIRED DETECTION SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY. THE PARTICULAR PART OF THE PROCESS THAT THIS PROJECT ADDRESSES IS THE MEASUREMENT OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF RADIOACTIVITY ON THE TRANSFER MEMBRANE. NORMALLY, THE AUTORADIOGRAPHS TAKEN OF THESE MEMBRANES REQUIRE AN EXPOSUREOF 16 TO 24 HOURS. FURTHERMORE, BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY IN SAMPLE ACTIVITY, THE AUTORADIOGRAPHIC STEP IS OFTEN ITERATED TO BRACKET THE EXPOSURE TIMES AND OBTAIN THE MAXIMUM IMAGE SHARPNESS. A NEWLY AVAILABLE, POSITION SENSITIVE NUCLEAR DETECTOR WILL BE EMPLOYED TO GENERATE A REAL-TIME IMAGE OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF RADIOACTIVITY ON THE TRANSFER MEMBRANE. FURTHERMORE, THIS IMAGE DETECTION SYSTEM WILL BE COUPLED TO A LABORATORY COMPUTER FOR DATA STORAGE AND ANALYSIS. BY THIS APPROACH, THE RESEARCHER WILL NOT ONLY BE ABLE TO OPTIMIZE DATA WITHOUT SUFFERING THE DELAYS ASSOCIATED WITH AUTORADIOGRAPHY, BUT WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO CARRY OUT THE PROCEDURE WITH A MUCH HIGHER LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE.

        "abstract": "Abstract         FOR MANY YEARS, NUCLEAR MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF DOWNHOLE GEOLOGICAL BORE HOLE LOGGING. APPROCHES RANGE FROM GAMMA RAY BACKSCATTER USED FOR GAUGING DENSITY TO NEUTRON ACTIVATION ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE COMPOSITION. THE CONDITIONS WHICH SEVERLY LIMIT THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE DETECTORS ARE: 1) THE VERY SMALL SPACE AVAILABLE FOR THE INSTRUMENTATION DOWN IN A BORE HOLE AND 2) THE HIGH AMBIENT TEMPERATURE FOUND BELOW THE EARTH'S SURFACE. THESE CRITERIA INTERACT SINCE COOLING APPARATUS ALONG WITH THE MECHANICAL ISOLATION NEEDED FOR PROTECTION FROM VIBRATION BECOMES BULKY VERY QUICKLY AS THE HEAT LOAD INCREASES. THE IDEAL SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM WOULD BE A HIGH Z (ATOMIC NUMBER), HIGH DENSITY SOLID STATE NUCLEAR DETECTOR WHICH COULD OPERATE WITH LITTLE OR NO COOLING. AN EXAMINATION OF THE PROPERTIES OF THE PRESENTLY KNOWN COMPOUND SEMICONDUCTORS HAS SHOWN THAT NONE WOULD BE IDEAL; ONE SEMICONDUCTOR DETECTOR, ZNTE, SHOWS PARTICULAR PROMISE. ZNTE IS A HIGH Z, HIGH DENSITY SEMICONDUCTOR WHICH IS THEORETICALLY CAPABLE OF OPERATING AT OR ABOVE 200 DEGREES C. THUS, WE PROPOSED TO INVESTIGATE ZNTE SENSORS WHICH SHOW GAMMA-RAY RESPONSE AT HIGHER TEMPERATURES AND TO IDENTIFY THE AREAS OF RESEARCH WHICH NEED TO BE STRESSED IN ORDER TO BRING ABOUT THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF THIS HIGH TEMPERATURE SENSOR.",

ONE RAPIDLY GROWING AREA IN THIS FIELD IS THE STUDY OF RESTRICTION FRAGMENT LENGTH POLYMORPHISMS (RFLPS). THIS PROCEDURE USES RADIOLABELED HYBRIDIZATION TECHNIQUES AND AUTORADIOGRAPHY TO CONSTRUCT A HUMAN GENETIC LINKAGE MAP BY IDENTIFYING GENETIC MARKERS ALONG THE GENOME. THE PARTICULAR PART OF THE PROCESS THAT THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES IS THE MEASUREMENT OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF RADIOACTIVITY ON THE TRANSFER MEMBRANE. NORMALLY THE AUTORADIOGRAPHS TAKEN OF THIS MEMBRANE REQUIRE AN EXPOSURE OF 16 TO 24 HOURS. FURTHERMORE, UNCERTAINTY IS INTRODUCED IN THE QUANTITATION OF THE RADIOACTIVE BANDS BECAUSE OF THE LIMITED DYNAMIC RANGE OF FILM AND THE RESOLUTION PROBLEMS WHICH ARISE WHEN PHOSPHOROUS-32 PROBES ARE USED. WE PROPOSE TO UTILIZE A NEWLY AVAILABLE, POSITION SENSITIVE NUCLEAR DETECTOR TO GENERATE A REAL TIME IMAGE OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE RADIOACTIVITY ON THE TRANSFER MEMBRANE. FURTHERMORE, WE PROPOSE TO PROJECT THIS IMAGE DIRECTLY ONTO A COMPUTER MONITOR FOR VISUALIZATION AND FURTHER DATA ANALYSIS. BY THIS APPROACH, THE RESEARCHER WILL BE ABLE TO AVOID THE DELAYS ASSOCIATED WITH AUTORADIOGRAPHY, AND WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO CARRY OUT THE PROCEDURE WITH A MUCH HIGHER LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE. SUCH AN ABILITY SHOULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE ENTIRE PROCEDURE AND ALLOW MORE RESOURCES TO BE DIRECTED TOWARD THE ANALYTICAL ASPECTS OF THE WORK.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         SEVERAL SPECIES OF CAMPYLOBACTER ARE KNOWN TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH WIDE RANGE OF HUMAN AND ANIMAL ILLNESSES, MAINLY GASTROENTERITIS, COLITIS, SEPSIS AND URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS. RECENTLY MANY STUDIES CONFIRMED THE CORRELATIONBETWEEN THE PRESENCE OF C. PYLORIDIS (C. PYLORI) ON THE GASTRIC MUCOSA AND DUODENAL ULCERATION. THE MECHANISM BY WHICH THIS ORGANISM INDUCES ULCER IS NOT CLEAR YET BUT IT IS KNOWN THAT COLONIZATION OF C. PYLORIDIS INDUCES LOCAL AND SYSTEMIC IMMUNE RESPONSES. THIS ANTIBODY RESPONSE DIRECTLY CORRELATES WITH HISTOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS OF CHRONIC OR ACTIVE ULCERS AS WELL AS RENAL TRANSPLANT PATIENTS. THEREFORE, DETECTION OF SPECIFIC ANTIBODIES (IGA, IGG, IGM) AGAINST THIS BACTERIA IS A GOOD INDICATION OF DIAGNOSIS OF GASTRIC ULCER. DURING PHASE I OF THIS STUDY FOUR DIFFERENT ANTIGERS FROM C. PYLORIDIS, C. JEJUNI AND C. COLI WILL BE PREPARED. THESEANTIGENS WILL BE USED FOR DEVELOPMENT OF ELISA AND MEASUREMENT OF ANTIBODIES IN THE PATIENT'S SERA WITH CONFIRMED MEDICAL HISTORY OF ULCER. CROSS REACTIVITY AND SPECIFICITY OF THESE ANTIBODIES WILL BE EXAMINED WITH ANTIGENS OF THREE DIFFERENT SPECIES OF CAMPYLOBECTER (C. FETUS, C. JEJUNI, C. COLI) KNOWN AS A MAJOR CAUSE OF GASTROENTERITIS BUT NOT OF GASTRIC ULCER. ALL ANTIGENS WILLBE ANALYZED BY ELECTROPHORESIS AND SPECIFIC BONDS WILL BE IDENTIFIED BY WESTERN BLOTTING USING POSITIVE C. PYLORIDIS SERA. DURING PHASE II OF THIS STUDY, SPECIES-SPECIFIC ANTIGEN(S) WILL BE PURIFIED AND CHARACTERIZED. MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES WILL BE PRODUCED FOR HISTOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS AS WELL AS FOR AFFINITY PURIFICATION OF THESE SPECIFIC ANTIGENS AND THEIR USE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SPECIFIC ELISA KITS. FINALLY, AFTER PHASE I FEASIBILITY STUDIES AND PHASE II OF SPECIFIC ELISA KIT PRODUCTION, WE HOPE THAT OUR ELISA TEST WILL REPLACE THE DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE PROCEDURES SUCH AS UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL ENDOSCOPY AND BIOPSY, WHICH ARE PRESENTLY REQUIRED TO DEMONSTRATE THE PRESENCE OF C. PYLORIDIS IN THE STOMACH.",

HEAT EXCHANGERS FOR CRYOCOOLER APPLICATIONS USED IN HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS, REMOTE SENSING, ETC., FREQUENTLY REQUIRE THERMAL EFFECTIVENESS OF OVER 98%. THIS IS DIFFICULT TO ACCOMPLISH,PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE EFFECT OF THE LONGITUDINAL THERMAL CONDUCTION. THE CONCEPT WILL MAXIMIZE THE THERMAL EFFECTIVENESS BY REDUCING THE LONGITUDINAL CONDUCTION EFFECT WHILE KEEPING THE PRESSURE DROP OF THE DEVICE AT A MINIMUM BY DESIGNING FOR SMOOTH FLOW. FURTHERMORE, THE CONCEPT ASSURES SUPERIOR RELIABILITY (LEAK TIGHTNESS), AND ADAPTABILITY FOR HIGH PRESSURES. THE DESIGN IS MODULAR, ALLOWING STACKING OF THE MODULE ELEMENTS AND RESULTING IN EASY MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, AND MAKING IT SUITABLE FOR VOLUME PRODUCTION. THE PROJECT CONSISTS OF AN ANALYTICAL STUDY TO DERIVE THE RELATIONSHIPS FOR THE LONGITUDINAL CONDUCTION EFFECTS TO MAXIMIZE THE THERMAL EFFECTIVENESS, A DESIGN STUDY, CONSTRUCTION OF A PROTOTYPE MODULE OF THE DEVICE, AND EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION OF THE PERFORMANCE. AS THE RECENT ADVANCES IN SUPERCONDUCTIVITY MOVE INTO THE AREA OF APPLICATIONS, THERE WILL BE A CRITICALNEED FOR HEAT EXCHANGERS WITH HIGH EFFECTIVENESS.",

HOWEVER, THERE IS A NEED TO DEVELOP A RAPID, SPECIFICAND RELIABLE METHOD TO EVALUATE RESULTS FROM FLUORESCENTLY LABELED POLYCLONAL ANTIBODIES CAPABLE OF REDUCING THE EX- PENSE ASSOCIATED WITH SUBSTANTIAL VOLUMES OF REACTANT MATERIALS. THIS PROPOSAL SUGGESTS THE USE OF COATED OR CLADOPTICAL FIBERS, WHICH ARE COILED TO PROVIDE A LONG OPTICAL PATH LENGTH, TO PROVIDE EXTREMELY HIGH SENSITIVITY DETECTORSFOR HETEROGENEOUS, FLUORESCENCE-LABELED IMMUNOASSAY TESTS. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM INVOLVES A MEANS OF EXCITING BOUND FLUORESCENT REAGENTS IN THE VICINITY OF THE OPTICAL FIBER COILS. THE INNOVATION OF THE PROPOSED WORK IS THE COMBIN- ATION OF FIBER OPTIC VLUORESCENCE EXCITATION AND A DETECTIONTECHNIQUE WHICH OPTIMIZES THE SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO OF THE IMMUNOSENSOR. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES INCLUDE PREPARATION AND EVALUATION OF OPTICAL FIBER BUNDLES; EVALUATION OF APPROPRIATE FLUORESCENTLY LABELED ANTIBODIES; DESIGN, FABRICATION, AND CALIBRATION OF THE OPTICAL FIBER FLUORS- SCENCE DETECTION SYSTEM; ACQUISITION OF TEST DATA AND CON- CEPTUAL DESIGN OF A PROOF-OR-CONCEPT FIBER-OPTIC SENSOR SYSTEM FOR FLUORESCENCE IMMUNOASSAY FOR EXTENSIVE TESTING IN PHASE-II OF THE PROGRAM.",

THIS ENHANCED PERFORMANCE WILL BE OBTAINED WITHOUT RESORTING TO HIGHLY PARALLEL SYSTEMS AND THE RESULTING PROBLEMS OF DECREASED MEAN TIME BETWEEN FAILURES AND HIGHLY COMPLEX PROGRAMMING ISSUES. ITEMS TO BE STUDIED ARE MEMORY HIERARCHY AND CACHING STRATEGIES AS WELL AS STORED IMAGE REPRESENTATION SCHEMES. USING STOCHASTIC MODELS OF BEHAVIOR AN OPTIMAL IMAGE PROCESSING ARCHITECTURE AND STORED IMAGE REPRESENTATION SCHEME WILL BE DESIGNED.",

THE TECHNIQUE IS BASED ON RECORDING THE NATURALLY OCCURRING FLUCTUATIONS THAT EXIST AT THE OUTPUT OF PRESSURE SENSORS AS THE PLANT IS OPERATING. THESE FLUCTUATIONS CAN BE ANALYZED TO GIVE THE SENSOR TRANSFER FUNCTION FROM WHICH THE SENSOR RESPONSE CAN BE DETERMINED. WITHOUT ADDITIONAL EFFORT, NOISE ANALYSIS PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE STATUS OF SENSING PRESSURE LINES THAT EXTEND FROM THE PROCESS TO THE SENSOR. ANY SENSING LINE BLOCKAGE WILL MANIFEST ITSELF IN THE RESULTS OF NOISE ANALYSIS FOR PRESSURE SENSOR RESPONSE TIME TESTING. PRESENTLY, PRESSURE SENSORS ARE TESTED USING A PRESSURE SIGNAL GENERATOR TO APPLY A PRESSURE WAVEFORM TO THE SENSOR AND MEASURE ITS DELAY. EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT THIS METHOD PRODUCES ERRONEOUS RESULTS BECAUSE OF INHERENT DIFFICULTIES WITH THE TEST. IN ADDITION, THE CURRENT METHOD REQUIRES ACCESS TO EACH SENSOR, WHICH USUALLYRESULTS IN RADIATION EXPOSURE TO TEST PERSONNEL. ANOTHER DISADVANTAGE OF THE PRESENT METHOD IS THAT IT DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE EFFECT OF VOIDS OR BLOCKAGES THAT MAY EXIST IN THE SENSING LINES. THIS PROJECT TAKES ADVANTAGE OF RECENT ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING TECHNIQUES AND INTERPRETATION METHODS. THE PHASE I EFFORT IS CONCENTRATINGON RESEARCH ON VALIDATION OF NOISE ANALYSIS FOR RESPONSE TIME TESTING OF PRESSURE, LEVEL, AND FLOW SENSORS IN NUCLEAR POWERPLANTS.",

THIS PROJECT WILL STUDY THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING A MAJOR BUILDING BLOCK OR BLOCKS FOR A MULTICHANNEL PREAMPLIFIER USING WITH CURRENT VERY LARGE SCALE INTEGRATION(VLSI) TECHNOLOGY. SPECIAL PROBLEMS INCLUDE THE COUPLING OFAN EXTREMELY LOW INTEGRATION CAPACITANCE AND HIGH TRANSCONDUCTANCE FIELD-EFFECT TRANSISTOR FRONT END TO A BIPOLAR OR METAL OXIDE SEMICONDUCTOR MAIN SECTION, PLUS AN OPTIONAL BUFFER SECTION CAPABLE OF DRIVING A RELATIVELY HIGH CAPACITIVE LOAD, SUCH AS IS TYPICALLY FOUND IN BACK-END ELECTRONICS FOR WAVEFORM SAMPLING. A MAJOR HURDLE TO THE FURTHER INTEGRATION OF FRONT-END DATA ACQUISITION ELECTRONICS IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH DENSITY PREAMPLIFIERSAND ASSOCIATED CALIBRATION AND SHAPING ELECTRONICS.

OTHER STUDIES HAVE INDICATED THAT COLON CANCER MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOSS OF A GENE,BUT A SINGLE GENE CHANGE DOES NOT EXPLAIN THE EXTENSIVE TISSUE CHANGES THAT OCCUR WITH COLON CANCER. GIVEN THE POTENTIALLY LARGE CHANGES IN GENE EXPRESSION THAT MAY OCCUR WHEN TISSUES BECOME MALIGNANT, IT BECOMES IMPERATIVE THAT WEARE ABLE TO IDENTIFY ALL GENES THAT ARE UNIQUELY EXPRESSED IN THE CANCEROUS STATE BY A MEANS THAT DOES NOT LIMIT WHICH GENES CAN BE DETECTED. TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF IDENTIFYING AND ISOLATING THE COMPLETE SET OF GENES THAT AREEXPRESSED UNIQUELY IN THE MALIGNANT STATE, WE PROPOSE TO USEOUR NATIVE-STATE CULTURE TECHNOLOGY THAT ALLOWS CULTURED NORMAL AND CANCEROUS TISSUE TO GROW INTACT THREE-DIMENSIONALLY IN VITRO WHILE MAINTAINING IN VIVO-LIKE TISSUE ORGANIZATION AND FUNCTION IN ORDER TO ISOLATE INTACT RNA FROM CULTURED NORMAL AND CANCEROUS COLON TISSUES. THIS RNA WILL BE USED FOR SYNTHESIS OF CANCER-SPECIFIC CDNA LIBRARIES. THE LIBRARIES WILL BE SCREENED BY CANCER-SPECIFIC CDNA PROBES WHICH ARE SYNTHESIZED ON CANCEROUS MRNA, WITH THE SUBSEQUENT REMOVAL OF GENE PRODUCTSCOMMON TO TUMOR AND NORMAL TISSUE BY SELECTIVE HYBRIDIZATIONWITH NORMAL-TISSUE MRNA AND ABSORPTION BY HYDROXY APATITE CHROMATOGRAPHY. THE PROBES WHICH ARE HIGHLY ENRICHED FOR SEQUENCES EXPRESSED SPECIFICALLY IN COLON CANCER WILL HYBRIDIZE TO CANCER-SPECIFIC CDNA CLONES, THEREBY IDENTIFYING THEM AND ALLOWING THEIR ISOLATION. IF THE ISOLATED CLONES ARE FOUND TO BE COMMON AND SPECIFIC TO A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF COLON CANCERS, THEY COULD SUBSEQUENTLY BE USED AS CANCER-SPECIFIC HYBRIDIZATION PROBES IN THE DETERMINATION OF SUSCEPTIBILITY, DIAGNOSIS, STAGING, FOLLOWING THE COURSE OF AND PROGNOSIS OF COLON CANCER WHICH WILL BE CARRIED OUT IN PHASE II.",

IN A TYPICAL SCENARIO DATA FROM MANY PROCESSORS AND SENSORS MUST BE TRANSMITTED AND ROUTED AT TREMENDOUS RATES FOR EFFECTIVE DECISION MAKING. THE LARGE TIME BANDWIDTH OF THE DATA EMANATING FROM CERTAIN SOURCES (GHZ RATES) MANDATES THE USE OF OPTICALCOMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY. TO ADDRESS THESE NEEDS APA OPTICS IS PROPOSING AN EFFORT THAT IS FOCUSED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CRITICAL COMPONENT OF HIGH SPEED OPTOELECTRONIC SWITCHES AND SWITCHING NETWORKS. OUR CONCEPT IS BASED UPON USING TOTAL INTERNAL REFLECTION IN A GAAS/A1GAAS MATERIAL SYSTEM. THIS CONCEPT PROMISES VERY HIGH SPEED BECAUSE THE TECHNIQUE MINIMIZES ELECTRODE AREA, WHICH REDUCES CAPACITANCE. IN ADDITION THIS SWITCH CAN BE MADE VERY SMALL, HAVE LOW DRIVE POWER AND IS SCALEABLE TO LARGE SWITCHING NETWORKS. THIS CONCEPT IS COMPATIBLE WITH MONOLITHIC INTEGRATING.",

A SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR PROGRAM WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE ELECTRICAL, OPTICAL AND ELECTRO-OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF THIS MATERIALS SYSTEM. THIS WILL BE SIGNIFICANT FROM DOD APPLICATIONS PERSPECTIVE. TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, OUR PROGRAM WILL BE THE FIRST EFFORT TO INCREASE THE SPHERE OF APPLICABILITY OF INTEGRATED OPTICS TO THE ULTRAVIOLET REGION. THE UV/VISIBLE ALXGA1-NN WAVEGUIDES WILL BE DEPOSITED USING LOW PRESSURE MOCVD AND CHARACTERIZED USING THE COMPUTER CONTROLLED TEST FACILITIES AT APA.

LOCATING THESE FIBERS TO WAVEGUIDES, MADE OF ELECTROOPTIC MATERIAL, USING PREALIGNED ETCHED \"V\" GROOVES IN A GAAS SUBSTRATE. OUR APPROACH IS BASED ON COUPLING THE INFORMATION FROM INPUT FIBERS TO SINGLE MODE WAVEGUIDES, ELECTRICALLY SWITCHING THE INFORMATION AMONG VARIOUS WAVEGUIDES AS DESIRED, AND EXITING THE INFORMATION FROM THE WAVEGUIDES TO OUTPUT FIBERS. REALIZATION OF THE THICK, SINGLE MODE WAVEGUIDES WILL PROVIDE A RELIABLE, LOW COST AND ENVIRONMENTALLY STABLE FIBER TO WAVEGUIDE COUPLING, AND FORMS THE BASIS OF OUR INNOVATIVE IDEA. KEY TECHNICAL ISSUES IN A TYPICAL SINGLE MODE FIBER AND WAVEGUIDE ARISE DUE TO CROSS SECTIONAL MISMATCH BETWEEN THE FIBER (5.0 MICRON) AND THE WAVEGUIDE (IN 0.5 MICRON). IN PHASE I, WE PROPOSE TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF THICK, FIBER-PROFILE MATCHED WAVEGUIDES BY DESIGNING, FABRICATING AND TESTING OF THE WAVEGUIDES.

THE INNOVATIVE TURBULENCE MODEL DESIGNED AT AMES RESEARCH CENTER BY MANSOUR, KIM AND MOIN (1987), CALLED THE MKM MODEL, WILL BE EXTENDED TO TREAT SEPARATED FLOWS. THE MKM MODEL IS A K-EPSILON MODEL DEVELOPED FROM A NEWLY-AQUIRED DATABASE OBTAINED FROM DIRECT SIMULATION OF A TURBULENT CHANNEL FLOW (KIM, MOIN AND MOSER 1987). THE MKM MODEL WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN AN IMPLICIT REYNOLDS-AVERAGED NAVIER-STOKES CODE IN CURVILINEAR COORDINATES. THE EFFORT HAS TWO GOALS. ONE IS TO DEVELOP A USER-FRIENDLY MODULAR CODE. A FUNCTION OF THIS COMPUTER CODE IS TO PROVIDE A PRACTICAL TOOL FOR RESEARCHERS IN TURBULENCE MODELING TO TEST AND DEVELOP TURBULENCE MODELS. THE OTHER GOAL IS TESTING THE MKM MODEL. THIS WILL BE PERFORMED ON THREE TEST FLOWS: 1) A LOW-SPEED DIFFUSER FLOW,2) A BACKWARD-FACING STEP AND, 3) A SHOCK-BOUNDARY LAYER INTERACTION. NEW DAMPING FUNCTIONS FOR THE EDDY VISCOSITY WILL BE INTRODUCED. THEIR FORM WILL BE VERIFIED USING THE DATABASE PROVIDED BY THE DIRECT SIMULATION AND THEY WILL BE TESTED ON THE THREE ABOVE MENTIONED TEST PROBLEMS. DAMPING FUNCTIONS IN THE EPSILON EQUATION WILL ALSO BE INTRODUCED AND TESTED, WHILE THE TURBULENT-KINETIC-ENERGY EQUATION WILL RETAIN ITS HIGH-REYNOLDS NUMBER FORM.",

AN EXPERIMENT TO USE AN FEL TO HEAT A HIGH DENSITY TOKAMAK, MTX, IS UNDER WAY AT LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY (LLNL). THE NEXT GENERATION OF FUSION MACHINES IS EXPECTED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES FOR HEATING AND PROFILE CONTROL. IT IS VERY DESIRABLE FOR THESE RF SOURCES AND TRANSMISSION LINES TO HAVE SUITABLE WINDOWS FOR RELIABILITY AND FOR TRITIUM CONTROL. DEPOSITION OF DIAMOND FILMS BY PLASMA CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION (CVD) HAS RECENTLY BEEN DEMONSTRATED. PRACTICAL PRODUCTION OF DIAMOND WINDOWS CAN BE ADVANCED WITH IMPROVED TECHNIQUES FOR PLASMA CVD. NEW PLASMA SOURCES, USING THE HIGH PRESSURE MICROWAVE AND ELECTRON CYCLOTRON RESONANCE CONCEPTS, HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY ADVANCED THE TECHNOLOGY FOR DIAMOND DEPOSITION. THESE SOURCES PROVIDE LARGE AREA, UNIFORM PLASMAS THROUGH PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY. DIAMOND FILMS WILL BE DEPOSITED WITH A THICKNESS GREATER THAN 0.1 MMAND A DIAMETER GREATER THAN 2 INCHES. THESE FILMS WILL BE GROWN ON A SUBSTRATE SUCH AS NICKEL, SILICON, OR SAPPHIRE. THE FILM-SUBSTRATE COMBINATION OR THE FREE-STANDING FILM, SEPARATED BY DISSOLVING THE SUBSTRATE, WILL BE EVALUATED. THE REAL AND IMAGINARY COMPONENTS OF THEDIELECTRIC CONSTANT OF THE FILMS WILL BE MEASURED IN THE MILLIMETER RANGE, AND THE FRACTURE STRENGTH WILL BE MEASURED IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF GROWING THICK DIAMOND FILMS FOR WINDOW AND INDEX APPLICATIONS.",

UNDER CONTROL OF THE BIOLOGIC MACHINE, 30 LITERS OF PURE AND STERILE WATER WILL BE ADDED TO THIS BAG. TO CREATE THE PURE AND STERILE WATER, A SINGLE-PATIENT WATER PURIFICATION SYSTEM, THE HD-100, WILL BE SUPPLIED IN MODIFIED FORM BY WATER PURE, INC. WATER WILL PASS THROUGH GRANULAR ACTIVATEDCHARCOAL, A 0.5 MICRON FILTER, A FILMTEC(R) REVERSE OSMOSIS MEMBRANE AND A MINNTECH POLYSULFONE HOLLOW FIBER ULTRAFILTER. DURING PHASE I WE WILL FIRST MODIFY BOTH THE BIOLOGIC-HD AND HD-100 AND CREATE THE DISPOSABLE PACKAGE INCLUDING THE 30 LITER BAG. THEN, WE WILL INTEGRATE THESE INTO A SINGLE SYSTEM WITH CONNECTIONS TO TRANSFER FLUID THROUGH STERILE CONNECTIONS, AND MONITOR THE VOLUME OF FLUID THROUGH MEASUREMENT WITH A SCALE IN THE BIOLOGIC. THOROUGH IN VITRO TESTS WILL DETERMINE THE STERILITY, CHEMICAL CONTENT, AND TEMPERATURE OF THE DIALYSATE, AND THE SAFETY, RELIABILITY, AND SENSITIVITY OF THE DIALYSIS DELIVERY SYSTEM. IF THESE TESTS ARE AFFIRMATIVE, THEN DURING PHASE II OF THIS PROJECT WE WILL FOCUS ON STEPS NECESSARY TO BRING TO MARKET A NIGHTTIME PERITONEAL DIALYSIS MACHINE CAPABLE OF PROVIDING DIALYSIS TREATMENTS WHICH ARE MORE EFFECTIVE AND LESS TIME-INTENSIVE THAN CAPD.",

THIS DECARBOXYLATOR DEVICE COULD HELP SUPPORT PATIENTS WHEN RESPIRATOR FAIL TO REMOVE SUFFICIENT CO2 OR BE USED IN PLACEOF RESPIRATORS IN PATIENTS WITH MODERATE CO2 RETENTION. THE DECARBOXYLATOR SYSTEM WILL BE CREATED BY DEVELOPING A NEW DISPOSABLE PACKAGE FOR THE BIOLOGIC DIALYSIS MACHINE THIS MACHINE IS DESIGNED TO PERFORM DIALYSIS THRU A SINGLE BLOOD ACCESS (SUBCLAVIAN CATHETER OR NEEDLE), USING A PLATEDIALYZER BOTH FOR CHEMICAL CLEARANCE AND FOR PUMPING BLOOD A DISPOABLE PACKAGE (DC PACK) WITH SUSPENSION OF CALCIUM HYDROXYL THAT WILL MOVE THROUGH A SCREEN PLATE DIALYZER IN A TO-AND-FRO MANNER TO MAINTAIN FLUIDITY WILL BE DESIGNED. WITHIN THE DIALYZER, THE CALCIUM HYDROXIDE WILL EXCHANGE ITS HYDROXYL FOR BICARBONATE, REMOVING ALMOST ALL OF THE BLOOD BICARBONATE WITHOUT EXCESSIVE CALCIUM OR HYDROXYL RETURN TO THE BLOOD. IN VITRO TESTS DURING PHASE I WILL DETERMINE THE CO2 REMOVAL RATE, CALCIUM RETURN, AND PH CHANGES CAUSED BY THE BIOLOGIC-DC SYSTEM. THESE STUDIES WILL INDICATE WHETHER THE SYSTEM HAS POTENTIAL FOR ASSISTINGPATIENTS IN RESPIRATORY FAILURE.",

THE BIOLOGIC-HD SYSTEM IS A SINGLE ACCESS, SORBENT BASED DIALYSIS SYSTEM WITH RECENTLY DEVELOPED MONITORS TO DETERMINE: TOTAL WEIGHT REMOVAL, BLOOD FLOW RATE, CLOTTING OF THE DIALYZER, AND COLUMN SATURATION (A CONTINUALLY OPERATING AMMONIUM MONITOR). THE AMMONIUM MONITOR CONTAINS A GAS-PERMEABLE MEMBRANE WHICH ALLOWS PASSAGE OF AMMONIUM INTO A PH SENSITIVE STRIP. A REFLECTANCE PHOTOMETER MEASURES COLOR CHANGE OF THE STRIP DURING DIALYSIS. WE NOW PROPOSE TO MODIFY THIS AMMONIUM MONITOR BY ADDING A UREASE-CONTAINING STRIP IN FRONT OF THE GAS-PERMEABLE MEMBRANE. THE AMMONIUM GENERATION AND COLOR CHANGE OF THE MONITOR WILL BE PROPORTIONAL TO THE UREA LEVEL. THE COMPUTERS IN THE MACHINE WILL DETERMINE THE APPROXIMATE BLOOD CONCENTRATION OF UREA BY APPLYING FORMULASINCLUDING BLOOD FLOW RATE AND THE DIALYSANCE OF THE DIALYZER. THE MACHINE WILL THEN BE ABLE TO DISPLAY: TIME OF COMPLETION OF AN EFFICIENT DIALYSIS (A 58% DROP IN BUN, EQUAL TO A KT/V=1), PROBABILITY OF SATURATING THE SORB COLUMN DURING THE TREATMENT, AND COMPARISON OF CHEMICAL PROCESS TO THAT EXPECTED FOR THIS PATIENT (KT/V=1). THE CHEMICAL RESULTS OF EACH TREATMENT WILL BE USED TO SUGGEST PROPER SETTINGS OF THE MACHINE FOR THE NEXT DIALYSIS OF THE PATIENT, AND CHEMICAL EFFECT OF TREATMENT WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE SMARTCHART(R) CLINICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM.

CURRENT SUBCUTANEOUS ACCESS IS VIA A NEEDLE TAPED IN PLACE. THE SUBCUTANEOUS INFUSION ACCESS DEVICE (SIAD) IS A SMALL IMPLANTABLE DEVICE WHICH CAN BE INSERTED UNDER THE SKIN THROUGH A 13 GAUGE NEEDLE. IMPLANTATION CAN BE DONE UNDER LOCAL ANESTHESIA. AN INSULINPUMP CAN BE CONNECTED TO IT AND IT PROVIDES CONTINUOUS ACCESS TO THE SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE FOR 6 MONTHS. THE MATERIALS OF THE SIAD AND SOFT ARE THEREFORE MORE COMFORTABLE THAN A NEEDLE CONTINUOUSLY INSERTED INTO THE SKIN. ONCE THE TISSUE HAS GROWN INTO THE TRANSCUTANEOUS CUFF MATERIAL AND FORMED A CONTINUOUS BARRIER, THERE IS LESSCHANCE OF INFECTION THAN FROM A NEEDLE. THE DESIGN OF THE SIAD WILL BE DEVELOPED USING IN VITRO INFUSION STUDIES. IT WILL THEN BE TESTED IN DIABETIC DOGS. THE INCREASED COMFORT AND SAFETY PROVIDED BY THIS DEVICE TO PATIENTS USING INSULIN PUMPS SHOULD MAKE THIS METHOD OF TREATMENT MORE ACCEPTABLE TO GREATER NUMBERS OF INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETICS.",

THE POTENTIAL ADVANTAGES OF THE ODWE OVER THE SCRAMJET INCLUDE: LOWER DIFFUSER TEMPERATURES AND PRESSURES, WITH CORRESPONDINGLY LOWER FLOW DECELERATION LOSSES; RELATIVELY UNIFORM STEADY COMBUSTION WITHIN A SMALLER LENGTH AND VOLUME; AND LESSER COOLING REQUIREMENTS. IN SPITE OF THESE POTENTIAL ADVANTAGES, THERE HAS TO DATE BEEN NO EXPERIMENT DEMONSTRATING THE STABILITY OF AN OBLIQUE DETONATION WAVE (ODW). THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED PROGRAM IS TO OBTAIN DATA ON THE STABILITY OF THE ODW, AND TO ASSESS THE APPLICABILITY OF THE ODW TO HYPERSONIC PROPULSION. THE PROPOSED PROGRAM CONSISTS OF COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMIC (CFD) ANALYSES OF THE ODW FOLLOWED BY AN EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION OF THE SUSTAINED, STABLE ODW IN A CONFIGURATION SIMILAR TO THE \"RAM CANNON,\" IN WHICH A PROJECTILE IS FIRED INTO A TUBE FILLED WITH A COMBUSTIBLE GAS MIXTURE. TO OBTAIN A HIGH ENOUGH INITIAL VELOCITY TO INITIATE THE ODW, THE PROJECTILE WILL BE ACCELERATED BY THE \"WAVE GUN,\" A TWOSTAGE HYPERVELOCITY LIGHT GAS GUN, TO VELOCITIES GREATER THAN 2 KM/SEC. THE RESULTING FLOW CONDITIONS WILL PRODUCE THE ODW, AS DISTINCT FROM THE THERMALLY CHOKED SUBSONIC COMBUSTION EXPERIENCED IN \"RAM CANNON\" TESTING TO DATE.",

SECOND, IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT CONTINUUM ANALYSES HAVE SHORTCOMINGS IN CERTAIN FLIGHT REGIMES AND RAREFIELD FLOW ANALYSES, SUCH AS MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS, ARE NECESSARY BUT NO ATTEMPT IN EVIDENCE TO PROVIDE A MATCHING PROCESS BRINGING COMPUTATIONS FOR CONTINUUM AND RAREFIELD REGIONS TOGETHER.

RECENT WORK IN SYMBOLIC SIGNAL ANALYSIS AND MANIPULATION HAS DEMONSTRATED THE POTENTIAL FOR THE AUTOMATIC TRANSFORMATION OF ALGORITHMS INTO EFFICIENT FORMULATIONS. THESE METHODS HAVE SHOWN PROMISE IN REDUCING THE HUMAN EFFORT REQUIRED IN DESIGNING EFFICIENT IMPLEMENTATIONS OF ALGORITHMS AND HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE ABILITY TO FIND NEW METHODS FOR IMPLEMENTING SOME SIGNAL PROCESSING OPERATIONS. CURRENTLY, HOWEVER, THESE METHODS ARE GENERAL-PURPOSE AND DO NOT MAINTAIN REALISTIC HARDWARE MODELS. AS A RESULT, IT IS DIFFICULT TO AUTOMATICALLY EVALUATE THE APPLICABILITY OF PARTICULAR ARCHITECTURES AND TO QUANTIFY PERFORMANCE. IT IS PROPOSED TO STUDY THE TECHNIQUES OF SYMBOLIC SIGNAL ANALYSIS AND MANIPULATION USING HARDWARE-SPECIFIC MODELS. THIS WORK WILL DEVELOP SPECIFICATIONS OF DIFFERENT ARCHITECTURES, INCLUDING BOTH REGULAR AND SPECIAL-PURPOSE ARCHITECTURES, AND WILL EXAMINE VARIOUS MEASURES OF MERIT, INCLUDING OPERATIONS COUNT, MEMORY, AND THROUGHPUT. SYMBOLIC METHODS FOR SIGNAL ANALYSIS AND TRANSFORMATION TAILORED TO THESE HARDWARE SPECIFICATIONS WILL BE DEMONSTRATED. PHASE I WILL ANALYZE CURRENT ALGORITHMS AND ARCHITECTURES FOR THE APPLICABILITY OF SYMBOLIC MANIPULATION, WILL DEVELOP AN EXPLICIT REPRESENTATION FOR A PARTICULAR HARDWARE ARCHITECTURE, AND WILL DEMONSTRATE SYMBOLIC ANALYSIS AND TRANSFORMATION OF SOME SIGNAL PROCESSING ALGORITHMS FOR THE CHOSEN ARCHITECTURE.",

IN ADDITION TO UPDATING THIS SURVEY, THIS EFFORT WILL DEVELOP AND DEMONSTRATE A NEURAL NETWORK APPROACH TO TARGET RECOGNITION BASED ON A NEW CLASS OF DISTRIBUTED, ITERATIVE IMAGE OPERATORS MODELED AFTER THE PHYSIOLOGY OF HUMAN VISION, WHICH WILL COMBINE PORTIONS OF THE LOW AND MEDIUM LEVEL VISION TASKS INTO A SINGLE INTEGRAL NETWORK. THE GOAL FOR THIS RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP AND EVALUATE A NEURAL NETWORK PARADIGM BY WHICH AN INITIAL SET OF SINGULARITIES IN THE VISUAL FIELD (JETS) DERIVED DIRECTLY FROM THE IMAGE DATA, IS REFINED TO BEST MATCH PRESCRIBED VISUAL AND GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS, VIA AN ITERATIVE NETWORK RELAXATION TECHNIQUE. THIS OPERATION WILL HAVE THE EFFECT OF EXTRACTING VISUALLY SIGNIFICANT FEATURES FROM IMAGERY AND INHERENTLY GROUPING THEM IN A MANNER NORMALLY ACHIEVED BY POST PROCESSING TECHNIQUES. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS APPROACH IS UNIQUE AND ADDRESSES A PRIMARY NEED IN THE APPLICATION OF NEURAL NETWORK TECHNOLOGY TO IMAGE ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED IN OUR PREVIOUS SURVEY, I.E., THE SELECTION OF APPROPRIATE IMAGE FEATURES TO SUPPORT TECOGNITION OBJECTIVES. WHILE THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUE IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN FEWER NETWORK LAYERS FOR LOW AND MEDIUM LEVEL VISION TASKS, IT WILL STILL BE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL PROCESSING TO SUPPORT HIGHER LEVEL FUNCTIONS SUCH AS TARGET IDENTIFICATION. ACCORDINGLY, THE UPDATED NEURAL NETWORK SURVEY WILL SPECIALLY EMPHASIZE THOSE NETWORK PARADIGMS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO HIGH LEVEL VISION PROCESSING TASKS.",

THE USE OF LIQUIDS IS MINIMIZED, THUS REDUCING THE LIKELIHOOD OF INFECTIOUS AEROSOL FORMATION. THIS SAME FORMAT WILL BE USED FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF PATHOGENSWHERE AN ANTIGEN DETECTION ASSAY WOULD BE MOST APPROPRIATE.

THESE VEHICLES SHOULD NOT ONLY BE ABLE TO OPERATE IN FLEXIBLE MISSION PROFILES, BUT ALSO BE COST EFFECTIVE. COMBINED CYCLE PROPULSION TECHNOLOGY IS THE PRIME CANDIDATE AS THE PROPULSION SYSTEM FOR ACHIEVING THESE GOALS. AEROTHERMODYNAMIC ANALYSIS OF VARIOUS COMBINED CYCLE PROPULSION CONCEPTS IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARD THE IDENTIFICATION, COMPARISON, AND SELECTION OF THESE NOVEL PROPULSION CONCEPTS FOR FURTHER R&D; EFFORT. NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF THE AEROTHERMODYNAMIC PERFORMANCE OF NINE DIFFERENT CONFIGURATIONS OF COMBINED CYCLES WITH BASIC SUBSYSTEMS OF TUBOJET, TURBO FAN, RAMJET, ROCKET, AND AIR AUGMENTED ROCKET IS PROPOSED. THE RESULTS WILL INCLUDE THE AEROTHERMODYNAMIC PERFORMANE CURVES, IDENTIFICATION OF THE OPTIMUM OPERATIONAL MODE FOR EACH CONFIGURATION, AND THE EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSED CONFIGURATIONS IN TERMS OF THEIR AEROTHERMODYNAMIC PERFORMANCE. THE DEVELOPED COMPUTER PROGRAM WILL BE UTILIZED IN FURTHER COMPREHENSIVE SIMULATION OF THE SELECTED COMBINED CYCLE PROPULSION CONCEPT(S) IN PHASE II OF THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION.",

THIS TECHNOLOGY IS BASED UPON THE MERGING OF TWO OTHER RELATIVELY NEW TECHNOLOGIES: MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES (HYBRIDOMA TECHNOLOGY) WITH PIEZOELECTRIC PLATE MODE (PM) ACOUSTIC MICRO SENSORS. ACOUSTIC WAVE SENSORS ARE SOLID STATE ELECTRONIC DEVICES WHICH ARE HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO MINUTE MASS CHANGES. SENSITIVITIES OF LESS THAN 10 PPB HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED FOR A GAS. SPECIFICITY IS A MAJOR TECHNICAL PROBLEM IN EVERY SENSOR SYSTEM. IN BIOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS, THE ADVENT OF MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES (MAB) HAS HELPED TREMENDOUSLY TO LEND THE REQUIRED SPECIFICITY TO ANALYTICAL METHODOLOGIES. THUS TECHNIQUES SUCH AS RIA AND EIA, WHICH ARE CURRENTLY THE MOST SENSITIVE AVAILABLE, UTILIZE MAB'S TO ATTAIN REPRODUCIBLE EPITOPE SPECIFICITY FOR BOTH HAPTENS AS WELL AS MACROMOLECULAR ANTIGENS. HOWEVER BOTH OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE LIMITED TO A PRACTICAL SENSITIVITY OF 1 NG FOR MACROMOLECULAR ANTIGENS IN A 4-8 HOUR ASSAY TIME. BY COMBINING THE EXPECTED SENSITIVITY OF PM WITH THE SPECIFICITY OF MAB BIODEWILL CREATE A NOVEL DETECTION TECHNOLOGY WHICH WILL SURPASS THIS SENSITIVITY BARRIER WHILE MAINTAINING THE REQUISITE SPECIFICITY.

THE DETECTORS ARE DESIGNED WITH A WIDE DYNAMIC RANGE TO ACCOMMODATE THE MULTIPLE PATH DATA COLLECTION NECESSARY FOR COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY. IN THE STANDARD RADIOGRAPHIC INSPECTION MODE, THIS FEATURE ALLOWS THE EVALUATION OF A WIDE RANGE OF MATERIAL THICKNESS WITH ONE X-RAY EXPOSURE TECHNIQUE. THE DISCRETE ELEMENT NATURE OF THE DETECTORS ALSO MINIMIZES CROSSTALK, SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING BLOOMING AND UNDERCUTTING WHICH OBSCURE THE EDGES IN IMAGES TAKEN WITH TRADITIONAL DETECTION TECHNIQUES. DETECTORS DESIGNED FOR INDUSTRIAL INSPECTION ALSO REQUIRE AN IMPROVED SPATIAL RESOLUTION TO SOLVE THE SMALL FEATURES NECESSARY FOR MANY MATERIAL EVALUATION APPLICATIONS. THIS PROJECT IS DESIGNED TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF DIGITAL RADIOGRAPHY AND COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY USING THESE HIGH PERFORMANCE DISCRETE ELEMENT DETECTORS AS A X-RAY DETECTION TOOL FOR ON-LINE CONTINUOUS MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS, SUCH AS METAL MATRIX COMPOSITES. DIGITAL RADIOGRAPHY DATA COLLECTION WITH THIS DETECTOR TECHNOLOGY REQUIRES THAT THE MATERIAL BE MOVED OR PASSED BETWEEN THE X-RAY SOURCE AND THE DETECTORS AT SPEEDS UP TO 1 INCH PER SECOND. SAMPLES OF COMPOSITES WHICH ARE MANUFACTURED IN A CONTINUOUS PROCESS, SUCH AS METAL MATRIX AND RESIN-BASED COMPOSITES, WILL BE COLLECTED FOR STUDY. REQUIRED X-RAY TESTING TECHNIQUES WILL BE COMPARED AGAINST PRACTICAL MANUFACTURING PROCESS PARAMETERS FOR COMPATIBILITY.

HAS DESIGNED A MEDICAL CT SCANNERWITH A SCAN TIME AS LITTLE AS 1 SECOND WITH CONTINUOUS BACK-TO-BACK SCANS USING A SLIP-RING AND HAVING SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF 1.7 1.P./MM AT CUT-OFF. THE SCANNER OFFERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE DUAL-ENERGY INVESTIGATION. IMPROVED DUAL-ENERGY SCANS ON THIS SYSTEM CAN OFFER MINIMAL MOTION ARTIFACT, LOWER PATIENT DOSE AND HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION. THIS PROPOSAL CONSISTS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF A UNIQUE DUAL-ENERGY SCANNING TECHNIQUE FOR HIGH-SPEED AND HIGH RESOLUTION CT SCANNING THAT COMBINES KVP SWITCHING AND BEAM FILTERING TO PRODUCE OPTIMAL SEPARATION RESULTS WITH MINIMIZATION OF SPECTRA OVERLAP. THIS TECHNIQUE CAN ALSO BE APPLIED TO ANY SLOWER, LOWER RESOLUTION CT SCANNER WITH THE BENEFIT OF LOWER DOSE EXPOSURE. PHASE 1 INCLUDES SPECTRA AND ATTENUATION COMPUTERMODELS FOR OPTIMAL FILTER/KVP SELECTION ALONG WITH FILTER FABRICATION AND IMPLEMENTATION.

IN THIS STUDY, WE WILL PREPARE AN ENZYME-LINKED ASSAY TO DETECT THESE TOXINS: ENZYME- OR COENZYME-TOXIN CONJUGATES WILL BE COUPLED WITH PURIFIED SODIUM CHANNELS FOR USE IN DISPLACEMENT ASSAYS TO QUANTITATE THE PRESENCE OF SITE 1 SODIUM CHANNEL TOXINS IN SAMPLES. SUCH ASSAYS SHOULD HAVE A SENSITIVITY COMPARABLE TO THE RADIOIMMUNOASSAYS CURRENTLY USED TO DETECT THESE TOXINS, BUT WILL AVOID THE HAZARDS OF USING RADIOISOTOPES, AND WILL ALSO HAVE A GREATLY IMPROVED CROSS-REACTIVITY, THUS ENABLING THIS ASSAY TO DETECT ANY SITE 1 TOXIN IN A SEAFOOD SAMPLE. IN PHASE I, WE PROPOSE TO PREPARE ENZYME AND COENZYME CONJUGATES OF SAXITOXIN AND TETRODOTOXIN, AND TEST THEM IN DISPLACEMENT ASSAYS USING PARTIALLY PURIFIED SODIUM CHANNELS.

THE STANDARD CULTURE METHODS ARE INADEQUATE FOR THE ROUTINE DIAGNOSIS OF THESE PATHOGENS. BY DEVELOPING DNA PROBE-BASED ASSAYS FOR THE DETECTION OF THESE PATHOGENS, IT WOULD BE PRACTICAL TO DELIVER DIAGNOSTICALLY VALUABLE INFORMATION TO THE DENTAL PRACTITIONER ON A ROUTINE BASIS. DNA PROBES FOR THE DETECTION OFTARGET DNA FROM THESE ORGANISMS WILL BE DEVELOPED BY ISOLATION OF WHOLE GENOMIC SEQUENCES OR SPECIES-SPECIFIC SEGMENTS AND USE IN A STANDARD MEMBRANE HYBRIDIZATION ASSAY. CONVENTIONAL RADIO-LABELLING, NOVEL SAMPLE PREPARATION AND HYBRIDIZATION, AND RECOMBINANT DNA TECHNOLOGY WILL BE EMPLOYED. PHASE II OBJECTIVES WILL INVOLVE CLINICAL STUDIES AND NON-ISOTOPIC METHODOLOGY. THE LONG TERM OBJECTIVE IS TO PROVIDE A RAPID, SENSITIVE AND ACCURATE DIAGNOSTIC BATTERY OF DNA PROBES FOR THE DETECTION OF PERIODONTAL DISEASE FOR COMMERCIAL APPLICATION",

IN PHASE I OF THIS PROJECT THE POSSIBILITY THAT DESFERROXAMINE TREATMENT CAN REDUCE ASBESTOS-CAUSED SQUAMOUS METAPLASIA IN TRACHEAL ORGAN CULTURES WILL BE STUDIED. SQUAMOUS METAPLASIA IS THOUGHT TOPRECEDE CHANGES THAT LEAD TO CARCINOGENESIS. IN PHASE I, THE ABILITY OF DESFERROXAMINE TO REMAIN BOUND TO ASBESTOS FOR LONG PERIODS WILL ALSO BE TESTED. IN THE FUTURE, UNDER PHASE II, DESFERROXAMINE-TREATED AND UNTREATED ASBESTOS WILLBE ADMINISTERED TO RATS AND THE LONG-TERM INCIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY WILL BE MEASURED. THIS STUDY WILL NOT ONLY TEST DESFERROXAMINE'S ABILITY TO REDUCE ASBESTOS TOXICITY BUT WILL ALSO TEST A CURRENT HYPOTHESIS THAT THE TOXICITY AND CARCINOGENICITY OF ASBESTOS IS DUE, IN PART, TO IRON-CATALYZED GENERATION OF HIGHLY REACTIVE OXYGEN RADICALS. THIS DESFERROXAMINE TREATMENT COULD BE USED WIDELY AS PART OF THE STANDARD CHEMICAL WASHING TREATMENT PERFORMED PRIOR TO ASBESTOS REMOVAL FROM BUILDINGS OR PRIOR TO WORKING IN AREAS WHERE ASBESTOS IS PRESENT. THIS COULD THEREFORE, IF EFFECTIVE, REDUCE THE RISK OF CONTRACTING ASBESTOS-RELATED DISEASES FOR ASBESTOS-REMOVAL AND OTHER WORKERS. COMMERCIALLY, THIS COULD REPRESENT A VERY LARGE MARKET SINCEASBESTOS REMOVAL FROM SCHOOLS, HOMES, AND OTHER BUILDINGS HAS BECOME A HIGH PRIORITY IN MANY COMMUNITIES.",

THIS LABORATORY PROPOSES A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ANSWER: AN INTERFERENCE FILTER THAT BLOCKS ALL OF THE VISIBLE SPECTRUM EXCEPT FOR THREE EXTREMELY NARROW SPECTRAL BANDS. WE HAVE SHOWN THAT SUCH A FILTER SUPPORTS EXCELLENT SEEING EVEN IN DIM LIGHT, WITH EXCELLENT VISUAL ACUITY AND EXCELLENT COLOR DISCRIMINATION, BECAUSE THE DISCARDED WAVELENGTHS ARE NOT NECESSARY TO GOOD SEEING. SUCH A FILTER OFFERS PROTECTION FROM ALL LASER WAVELENGTHS EXCEPT ONES THAT FALL EXACTLY ON ONE OF THE NARROW PASSBANDS.

A RIGOROUS DEVELOPMENT OF THE HILBERT SPACE THEORY FOR APPROXIMATION OF NONLINEAR CONTROLLED MARKOV PROCESSES BY STATE SPACE AFFINE MODELS AND BY CANNONICAL VARIATE ANALYSIS IS PROPOSED. FINITE DIMENSIONAL STATE AFFINE MODELS OBTAINED BY TRUNCATION OF THE INFINITE DIMENSIONAL CVA WILL BE USED TO DERIVE PRACTICAL COMPUTATIONAL ALGORITHMS FOR APPROXIMATION OF OPTIMAL SYSTEM IDENTIFICATION AND STOCHASTIC FILTERS FOR NONLINEAR SYSTEMS.

THE ROLE OF EAAS IN THESE DISORDERS APPEARS TO INVOLVE ABNORMALLY ENHANCED ACTIVATION OF EAA RECEPTORS THAT LEADS TO EXCITOTOXIC CELL DAMAGE AND NEURONAL DEATH. RECENT EVIDENCE FROM ANIMAL MODELS INDICATES THAT SELECTIVE ANTAGONISTS FOR THESE RECEPTORS CAN BE EFFECTIVE IN THE PREVENTION OF RECEPTOR OVER-STIMULATION AND SUBSEQUENT CELL DEATH. THIS SUGGESTS THAT EAA ANTAGONISTS THAT PENETRATE THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER AND ACT SELECTIVELY AT ONE OR MORE OF THE EAA RECEPTOR SUBTYPES MAY BE OF MAJOR CLINICAL IMPORTANCE FOR THE TREATMENT OF DISORDERS INVOLVING EAA NEUROTOXIC MECHANISMS. CURRENTLY, PRELIMINARY IDENTIFICATION OF EAA RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS REQUIRES TIME-CONSUMING AND COMPLICATED ASSAYS USING LIVE ANIMALS OR ANIMAL TISSUES. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOPA SIMPLIFIED ASSAY SYSTEM THAT IS SENSITIVE, RELIABLE, AND RAPID, AND WHICH DOES NOT REQUIRE CONTINUAL ANIMAL SACRIFICE. IN PHASE I OF THIS PROJECT WE WILL IDENTIFY AND CHARACTERIZE NEURONAL CELL LINES EXPRESSING FUNCTIONAL EAA RECEPTORS FROM A NOVEL GROUP OF NEURAL CELL LINES THAT HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN CHARACTERIZED FOR THESE RECEPTORS. THESE LINES WERE ESTABLISHED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF ONCOGENES INTO PRIMARY BRAIN TISSUES USING RETROVIRAL VECTORS. IN PHASE II, WE WILL USE SCREENS EMPLOYING CELL LINES CONTAINING EAA RECEPTORS TO IDENTIFY NOVEL EAA ANTAGONISTS FROM NATURAL SOURCES (E.G., SPIDER VENOMS) AND SYNTHETIC COMPOUNDS UNDER ANALYSIS AT CNS RESEARCH.",

NO WHERE IS THIS MORE APPARENT THAN THE LARGE DEPENDENCY AMERICAN MANUFACTURING HAS ON SEMICONDUCTOR DESIGN AND FABRICATION. THE PRODUCTION OF AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT REQUIRES A FOUR STAGE PROCESS: 1) WAFER FABRICATION; 2) WAFER PROBE; 3) ASSEMBLY (PACKAGING); AND 4) FINAL TEST. BECAUSE OF THE HIGH CAPITAL COSTS AND FAIRLY LOW VARIABLE RATE PRODUCTION COSTS, MANUFACTURERS OF SEMICONDUCTORS TRY TO MAINTAIN HIGH UTILIZATION OF THE WAFER FABRICATION EQUIPMENT. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THE TASK OF EFFECTIVELY GENERATING SCHEDULES WHICH IMPROVE PERFORMANCE OF THE PRODUCTION SYSTEM. WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF BOTTLENECK PROCESSES DOMINATING THE SCHEDULE, IT IS REASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT CONCEPTS SUCH AS AGGREGATIONAND DECOMPOSITION CAN BE APPLIED TO REDUCE THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM TO ONE WHICH ESSENTIALLY INVOLVES ONLY THE BOTTLENECK PROCESSES. THEN, GIVEN A SOLUTION TO THE SIMPLERPROBLEM, TECHNIQUES OF DISAGGREGATION CAN BE APPLIED TO \"EXPLODE\" THE SOLUTION INTO THE FULL SCHEDULE.",

THE EFFICIENT CONTROL OF THESE PROCESSES REQUIRES THE REAL TIME ON-LINE MEASUREMENT OF EFFLUENT GASES TO MONITOR THE PROCESS AND TO PERMIT FEEDBACK CONTROL OF THE WASTE FEED COMPOSITION, THE COMBUSTION PROCESS, AND THE DOWNSTREAM SCRUBBER SYSTEMS. ANALYSIS OF HC1 PRESENTS UNUSUAL PROBLEMS FOR EXTRACTIVE ANALYZERS BECAUSE OF CORROSION IN THE SAMPLING SYSTEM AND LINES AND THE REQUIREMENT THAT WATER REMOVAL SHOULD NOT ALTER THE HC1 CONCENTRATION. CURRENT TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES DURABLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE ANALYSIS SYSTEMS FOR O(2) AND CO, AND IMPROVED SYSTEMS ARE UNDER DEVELOPMENT FOR SO(2) AND NO(X). THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP A SIMPLE AND DURABLE ANALYZER SYSTEM FOR ON-LINE MEASUREMENT OF HC1 IN THE HARSH ENVIRONMENT OF COMBUSTION FLUE GAS. PHASE I ADDRESSESTHE DEVELOPMENT OF SELECTIVE ADSORBENTS FOR HC1 AND WILL EVALUATE THE INTERFERENCE FROM OTHER FLUE GAS CONSTITUENTS SUCH AS CO(2), AND H(2)O. THE INITIAL OBJECTIVE WILL BE MEASUREMENT OF HC1 IN THE CONCENTRATION RANGE OF 10 TO 200 PPM USING CLOSE-COUPLED EXTRACTIVE TYPE ANALYZERS. PHASES II AND III WILL BE DIRECTED AT THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MASS-SENSITIVE TRANSDUCER AND ANALYZER SYSTEM AS WELL AS EXTENSIVE FIELD TESTING TO ESTABLISH DURABILITY, LIFE, AND STABILITY IN THE HARSH ENVIRONMENT OF WASTE INCINERATOR FLUE GAS.",

TRANSPLANTATION OF PANCREATIC ISLETS IN ANIMAL MODELS CAN COMPLETELY CURE DIABETES AND MORE IMPORTANTLY MAKE THE ANIMAL ABSOLUTELY INDEPENDENT OF INSULIN. THE SUCCESSFUL TRANSPLANTATION OF ISLETS CAN BE FACILITATED IN A CLINICAL SITUATION IF ADEQUATE MEANS OF PRESERVING ISLETS ARE AVAILABLE. THE OVERALL LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SOPHISTICATED FREEZING TECHNOLOGY FOR HUMAN ISLETS WHICH WOULD SELECTIVELY DESTROY LEUKOCYTES TO MODULATE THE IMMUNOGENICITY OF ISLET PREPARATIONS. THE DESIGN OF A CRYOPRESERVATION PROTOCOL WHICH WOULD SELECTIVELY DESTROY CONTAMINATING CELLS WHILE SPARING THE ISLET CELLS REQUIRE STUDYING BASIC PROPERTIES OF THESE CELLS THAT GOVERN THEIR RESPONSE TO THE CRYOPRESERVATION PROCESS. THIS PROPOSAL OUTLINES KEY DEVELOPMENT STEPS IN THE CRYOPRESERVATION OF \"INDIVIDUAL MOUSE ISLET CELLS\". IN ORDER TO AVOID, OR AT LEAST TO MINIMIZE FREEZING INJURY, THE KINETICS OF WATER TRANSPORT AND THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH INTRACELLULAR ICE FORMS MUST BE KNOWN. SINCE THESE CONDITIONS MAY BE DEFINED BY THE VALUES OF WATER PERMEABILITY OF THE PLASMA MEMBRANE, AND ICE-NUCLEATION TEMPERATURE OF THE CELL CYTOPLASM, IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THESE PARAMETERS BE DETERMINED IN ORDER TO FORMULATE A RATIONAL APPROACH TO CRYOPRESERVATION OF ISLET CELLS. THIS PROJECT PROPOSES TO DETERMINE CRYOPRESERVATION PARAMETERS INSINGLE MOUSE ISLET CELLS AND TO DEVELOP METHODS TO FORM PSEUDO-ISLETS FROM DISSOCIATED ISLET CELLS. BASED UPON THE BIOPHYSICAL PARAMETERS, KINETIC MODELS WILL BE CONSTRUCTED TO OPTIMIZE THE ADDITION OF THE CRYOPROTECTANT, FREEZING OF THE CELL SUSPENSION, AND REMOVAL OF THE CRYOPROTECTANT FROM THE CELL SUSPENSION.",

THE BATTERY UTILIZES A HIGH CONDUCTIVITY LOWER OPERATING TEMPERATURE SOLID ELECTROLYTE WHICH OFFERS NO DEGRADATION OF OVC, HAS LOW HEAT REQUIREMENTS AND HIGH INTEGRITY DUE TO ABSENCE OF LIQUID/VOLATILE HASES. THE THRUST OF THE DEVELOPMENT EFFORT WILL BE IN THREE CRITICAL AREAS: (1) SUPERIOR BATTERY MATERIALS AND THIN CELL BIPOLAR DESIGN THAT REDUCES IR SIGNIFICANTLY ALLOWING HIGH POWER DENSITY TO OBTAIN, (2) FAST ELECTROCHEMICAL KINETICS ALLOWING GREATER UTILIZATION OF STOICHIOMETRIC CAPACITY, AND (3) IMPROVES THERMAL MANAGEMENT DUE TO LOWER TEMPERATURE OPERATION. CERAMATEC'S INNOVATIVE MULTIPHASE SOLID ELECTROLYTE, CURRENTLY UTILIZED IN SAFT'S HIGH PERFORMANCE BATTERIES, COUPLED WITH THIN CELL TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES A VIABLE APPROACH TO DEVELOPING HIGH PERFORMANCE BATTERIES CAPABLE OF PROVIDING HIGH PEAK POWER DENSITIES IN VERY SMALL VOLUMES. SAFT, A RECOGNIZED LEADER IN DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE, AND TESTING OF BATTERIES FOR MILITARY/AEROSPACE APPLICATIONS, PROVIDES INPUT IN COMPONENT DESIGN AND ASSEMBLY AND TESTING OF THE BATTERY. CERAMATEC WILL FABRICATE THIN CELLS AND SAFT WILL ASSEMBLE THE BATTERY AND EVALUATE ITS PERFORMANCE.",

THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL FOCUS ON THE TESTING AND REFINEMENT OF THE PHYSICAL MODELS FOR: (A) MASS TRANSFER UNDER TRANSITION (FROM SUBCRITICAL TO SUPERCRITICAL) CONDITIONS, (B) TURBULENT DIFFUSION OF DROPLETS AND DENSED-GAS PUFFS, AND (C) GROUP COMBUSTION IN THE DENSE SPRAY REGION.

THE AIM OF PHASE I WAS TO DEFINE A FRAMEWORK FOR DEVELOPMENTOF A GENERAL PURPOSE COMPUTER PROGRAM BY EXAMINING BOTH SINGLE-AND TWO-PHASE MODELS. THE SINGLE-PHASE MODEL EQUATIONS ARE RELATIVELY EASY TO SOLVE BUT REQUIRE A PRESCRIPTION OF THE SOLID PHASE-VELOCITY AND OTHER ASSUMPTIONS FOR COMPUTING THE LOCAL MASS FRACTIONS OF THE PHASES. THE TWO-PHASE MODEL DOES NOT HAVE THESE SHORTCOMINGS BUT NEEDS DATA ON INTERFACIAL EXCHANGE COEFFICIENTS WHICH REQUIRE FURTHER RESEARCH.

THE AVAILABILITY OF THESE NEW METHODS WILL HAVE IMPACT ON MANY AREAS OF HEALTH-RELATED RESEARCH. SINCE ALL BIOLOGICAL REACTIONS OCCUR IN CONDENSED PHASE, THE MAJOR CHALLENGE IS TO DESCRIBE THE MANY-BODY EFFECT OF THE SOLVENT ON THE DYNAMICS OF THE REACTION. THE APPROACH TAKEN HERE IS TO EXTEND AND ADAPT THE MOST PRACTICAL AND RELIABLE METHOD OF GAS-PHASE REACTION RATE THEORY TO TREAT REACTIONS IN SOLUTION. THE GAS-PHASE THEORY IS WELL ESTABLISHED AND ALSO PROVIDES A CONVENIENT FRAMEWORK FOR INCLUDING THE SOLVENT EFFECTS IN A NUMBER OF WAYS. SEVERAL METHODS WILL BE EXPLORED FROM SIMPLE APPROXIMATE MODELS THAT HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF COMPUTATIONAL EASE, TO MORE DETAILED DYNAMICAL TREATMENTS EMPLOYING STOCHASTIC MODELING.

THE USE OF LING ZHI CAO FOR VARIOUS AILMENTS (E.G., TREATEMENT AND PREVENTION OF MALIGNANT TUMORS, CHRONIC HEPATITIS, ARTHRITIS, BRONCHITIS AND ASTHMA) IS WELL DOCUMENTED AND PRACTICED IN CHINA, KOREAAND JAPAN. ONE OF THE PROPOSED MODES OF GANODERMA'S EFFICACYIS THE STIMULATION OF THE HOST IMMUNE SYSTEM. ISOLATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF THE PRINCIPAL IMMUNOSTIMULANT AGENTS FROM GANODERMA COULD LEAD TO POTENTIALLY VALUABLE PROPHYLAXES AND/OR CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENTS FOR TREATING NOT ONLY CERTAIN TYPES OF MALIGNANT TUMORS BUT ALSO HOST-MEDIATED IMMUNOLOGICAL DISORDERS (E.G., RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND AIDS). GANODERMA LUCIDUM, ONE OF THE MOST TREASURED MUSHROOMS IN THE ORIENT HAS BEEN CHOSEN FOR A THOROUGH PHYTOCHEMICAL STUDY IN RESPECT TO IMMUNOSTIMULATION POTENTIAL. THREE RESEARCH AREAS ARE PROPOSED: (1) PHYTOCHEMICAL FRACTIONATIONOF G. LUCIDUM FRUITING BODIES AND MYCELIA, (2) IN VIVO AND IN VITRO ANALYSIS OF THE HOST IMMUNORESPONSE TO G. LUCIDUM AND (3) CULTIVATION OF G. LUCIDUM.",

THE LABELED PROBES WILL BE SIMULTANEOUSLY HYBRIDIZED TO GENOMIC DNA FRAGMENTS GENERATED WITH A RESTRICTION ENZYME. THE HYBRIDIZED PROBES WILL SERVE AS PRIMERS FOR THE SEQUENCE TO ELONGATE DNA. THE ELONGATED DNAFRAGMENTS WILL BE SEPARATED BY HIGH-PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY, USING A NEWLY INTRODUCED GEN-PAK FAX COLUMN AND WILL BE DETECTED WITH A FLUORESCENCE DETECTOR .

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE CORROSIVE AND EROSIVE ASPECTS OF COAL CONVERSION AND UTILIZATION LIMIT OPERABILITY AND RELIABILITY IN ENERGY SYSTEMS USING COAL. TO IMPROVE COMPONENT LIFETIME, MATERIALS HAVING INCREASED RESISTANCE TO CORROSION DEGRADATION UNDER OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS ARE REQUIRED. ALLOYS THAT PRODUCE PROTECTIVE OXIDES ON THEIR SURFACE ARE WIDELY UTILIZED FOR HIGH TEMPERATURE APPLICATIONS. ALPHA-ALUMINA IS ONE OF SEVERAL METAL OXIDES THAT CAN BE EFFECTIVE IN PROVIDING PROTECTION FOR ALLOYS AGAINST SULFIDATION ATTACK UNDER CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS FOUND IN FOSSIL ENERGY SYSTEMS. HOWEVER, THE ALPHA-ALUMINA SCALE USUALLY HAS POOR ADHESION AND THUS HAS LIMITED PROTECTION CAPABILITIES, PARTICULARLY IN APPLICATIONS SUBJECT TO THERMAL CYCLING. A NOVEL TECHNIQUE FOR IMPROVING THE ADHERENCE OF METAL OXIDE SCALES TO THEIR SUBSTRATE HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED PREVIOUSLY IN FERRITIC ALLOYS. THE TECHNIQUE INVOLVES THE GENERATION OF A NITRIDEDLAYER ON THE SURFACE OF THE BASE MATERIAL PRIOR TO EXPOSURE TO THE OXIDIZING ENVIRONMENT. INCOHERENT NITRIDES IN THE SURFACE LAYERS SUBSEQUENTLY IMPROVE THE ADHERENCE OF THE OXIDE SCALE, RESULTING IN IMPROVED SPALLING RESISTANCE AND LEADING TO EXTENDED SERVICE LIFETIMES. THIS PROJECT WILL ATTEMPT TO USE THESE PRINCIPLES TO IMPROVE THE SCALE ADHERENCE, AND THUS THE SERVICE LIFETIME, OF FE-CR-AL ALLOYS. THE OBJECTIVE WILL BE TO EMPLOY A MODIFICATION OF AN ACCEPTED SURFACE TREATMENT (NITRIDING) TO PRODUCE INCREASED CORROSION RESISTANCE AND EXTENDED LIFETIMES OF COMPONENTS WITHOUT RECOURSE TO MORE EXPENSIVE EXOTIC ALLOYS. THE DEVELOPED PROCESS WILL BE ECONOMICALLY ATTRACTIVE AS IT WILL RELY ON RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE PROCESSING OF ALLOYS IN CURRENT USE. WIDESPREAD APPLICATIONOF THE PROCESS IS ANTICIPATED TO COMPONENTS IN FOSSIL ENERGY TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER HIGH TEMPERATURE PROCESSES.",

A COMPLEX ROBOTIC SENSOR SYSTEM CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS A CLASSICAL FEEDBACK/CONTROL LOOP. AS THE MONITORING SYSTEM IS PRESENTED WITH PHENOMENA THAT MAY RANGE FROM SLIGHT ABNORMALLY TO POTENTIAL CATASTROPHIC, THE SYSTEM MUST DETECT AND WARN THROUGH FEEDBACK. WITHIN THE FEEDBACK/CONTROL LOOP, WE PROPOSE TWO ELEMENTS BOTH SMALL AND FAST ENOUGH TO OPERATE IN REAL TIME CALLED PROVIDER AND DECIDER. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROVIDER/DECIDER ENTITY IS TO ACCEPT INPUTS FROM MULTIPLE SENSORS, PERFORM SIGNAL FUSION AND MAKE DECISIONS ON ACTION OR INACTION. THE PROVIDER/DECIDER TECHNIQUE PROPOSAL IS KNOWN AS FINITE INDUCTIVE SEQUENCES (FIS) PROCESSING.

IN PARTICULAR, RELIEF IS NEEDED ON A GENERAL PURPOSE BASIS IN THREE AREAS: REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF WORK, REDUCING THE REQUISITE USER KNOWLEDGE--ESPECIALLY OF COMPUTERS AND NUMERICAL METHODS, AND ENHANCING THE EFFICIENCY OF THE VERY LENGTHLY COMPUTATIONS. EXISTING SYSTEMS ARE ORIENTED TO RESPECTIVE NARROW AREAS AND ARE INEFFICIENT. THEY ALSO LACK THE INTELLIGENCE THAT CAN EFFECTIVELY AID A USER. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM INTEGRATES FOUR AREAS OF TECHNOLOGY: (I) SPECIFICATION LANGUAGE AND AUTOMATED GENERATION OF PROGRAMS, (II) VERIFICATION OF MATHEMATICAL CORRECTNESS: (III) SYMBOLIC MANIPULATION AND (IV) NUMERICAL ANALYSIS. THE SPECIFICATION LANGUAGE IS THAT OF REGULAR AND BOLLEN ALEGEBRA--WHICH LENDS THE SYSTEM ITS GENERAL PURPOSE CAPABILITIES. IT GENERATES HIGHLY OPTIMAL PROGRAMS AND GUIDES THE USER IN IMPROVING EFFICIENCY OF ALGORITHMS. THE VERIFICATION PART GUIDES THE USER IN COMPOSING A COMPLETE AND CONSISTENT MODEL. EQUATIONS AND OPTIMIZATIONS ARE THEN MANIPULATED INTO A FORM ACCEPTABLE BY APPROPRIATE NUMERIC METHODS ARE USED. FINALLY--A FAST PROTOTYPING PART FEEDS BACK THE COMPUTED RESULTS TO THE USER. THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AS PART OF A PHD DISSERTATION RESEARCH. THE PHASE I OBJECTIVES ARE TO TRANSFORM IT INTO A RELIABLE AND ROBUST SYSTEM AND DEMONSTRATE ITS ADVANTAGES IN REAL LIFE LARGE APPLICATIONS.

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE IMPORTANCE OF REDUCING THE NOISE OF THE HELICOPTER TAIL ROTOR HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED FOR MANY YEARS. HOWEVER, BOTH THE PREDICTION OF TAIL-ROTOR NOISE AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOW NOISE DESIGNS HAS BEEN IMPEDED BY POOR ABILITY TO SIMULATE NOISE-GENERATING INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE MAIN-ROTOR WAKE AND THE TAIL ROTOR. IN MANY CASES, EVEN THEFLIGHT CONDITIONS LEADING TO SUBSTANTIAL MAIN-ROTOR/TAIL-ROTOR INTERACTION HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE. RECENT ADVANCES IN THE MODELLING OF FREE-VORTEX WAKES AT CONTINUUM DYNAMICS, INC. HAVE GENERATED TOOLS THAT CAN AMELIORATE THIS SITUATION. FULL-SPAN FREE WAKE MODELS FOR ROTOR BLADES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED THAT CAN GENERATE COMPLETE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE INCIDENT-VORITICITY FIELD IN THE VICINITY OF THE TAIL ROTOR. CURVED VORTEX ELEMENTS ARE USED IN THIS WAKE MODEL AND PRODUCE HIGHLY ACCURATE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE LOCAL VELOCITY FIELD. IN LIGHT OF PREVIOUS SUCCESSES IN TREATING HIGH FREQUENCY AIRLOADS ON MAIN ROTORS, IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE COUPLINGOF THESE NEWLY DEVELOPED TOOLS TO APPROPRIATELY MODIFIED VERSIONS OF EXISTING BLADE LOAD ANALYSES CAN PRODUCE A COMPUTATIONAL SIMULATION CAPABLE OF PROVIDING IMPROVED DEFINITION OF MAIN-ROTOR/TAIL-ROTOR INTERACTIONS AND THE RESULTING UNSTEADY LOADS THAT LEAD TO STRONG ACOUSTIC EMISSIONS.",

THE STRESS REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE A GIVEN STRAIN IN PLASTICS, SHAPE MEMORY ALLOYS, CLOTH, ETC. DEPENDS ON THESTRESS DIRECTION AND PAST HISTORY. MAGNETS, ELECTRETS, HEAT TREATMENT OF METALS, ETC. SHOW SIMILAR BEHAVIOR. ENGINEERING DESIGN IS SEVERELY LIMITED WITH THESE MATERIALS BY THE LACK OF A SIMPLE, SELF-CONSISTENT SET OF PREDICTIVE EQUATIONS. SUCH A SET OF PREDICTIVE EQUATIONS HAVE BEEN DERIVED AND TESTED FOR THE SHAPE MEMORY ALLOY, NITINOL. THIS THEORY HAS TWO PARTS: 1) A STATE EQUATION, WHICH UNIQUELY AND COMPLETELY RELATES STRESS, STRAIN AND TEMPERATURE USING 6 MATERIAL SPECIFIC COEFFICIENTS; & 2) A THERMODYNAMICS WHICH RELATES THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR (STATE EQUATION) TO THE HEAT FLOW PROPERTIES. THE STATE EQUATION DESCRIPTION OF MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY TESTED. PRELIMINARY TESTS INDICATE THE SAME FORM OF EQUATION APPLIES TO ELECTRETS AND OTHER HYSTERETIC MATERIALS. THE THERMODYNAMIC PREDICTIONS HAVE NOT YET BEEN TESTED BY SUBSEQUENT MEASUREMENTS. THE PROPOSED PHASE I RESEARCH IS TO TEST THE THERMODYNAMICS. THE PHASE II RESEARCH WILL USE THE THEORY TO STUDY NITINOL FATIGUE, REFINE THE FORM OF THE STATE EQUATIONS, AND APPLY THE THEORY TO OTHER HYSTERETIC MATERIALS.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         FUSION ENERGY POWER REACTORS WILL REQUIRE HIGH SPEED VACUUM PUMPS TO EXHAUST REACTION PRODUCTS FROM THE PLASMA. CRYOGENIC PUMPS, WHICH FREEZE GASES ON A LOW TEMPERATURE SURFACE, ARE POTENTIALLY VERY ATTRACTIVE FOR THIS TASK. HOWEVER, THEY MUST BE REMOVED PERIODICALLY FROM SERVICE TO BE REGENERATED (DEFROSTED), OTHERWISE THEY EITHER SATURATE OR ACQUIRE AN UNACCEPTABLY HIGH INVENTORY OF RADIOACTIVE TRITIUM. THE DEVELOPMENT EFFORT IN THIS PROJECT WILL SOLVE THIS PROBLEM WITH A PUMP BASED ON THE SNAIL HIGH THROUGHPUT CONTINUOUS CRYOPUMP, WHICH REGENERATES THE CRYOPUMPING SURFACES CONTINUOUSLY DURING NORMAL OPERATION WITH A SPECIALHEAD THAT MOVES OVER AND CLEANS THE FROZEN GASES FROM THE CRYOPUMPING SURFACES. THE RESEARCH WILL EXTEND THE SNAIL CONCEPT TO THE CRYOSORPTION PROCESS. THIS WILL PRODUCE TWO SIGNIFICANT PRACTICAL ADVANTAGES OVER THE CRYOCONDENSATION PUMP. FIRST IS THE ABILITY TO CONTINUOUSLY PUMP HELIUM, THEREACTION PRODUCT OF THE BASIC FUSION PROCESS. SECOND IS THEABILITY TO PUMP BOTH HELIUM AND THE HYDROGEN ISOTOPES AT MUCH HIGHER TEMPERATURES, THEREBY ELIMINATING THE NEED TO USE LIQUID HELIUM AS A REFRIGERANT. THE PHASE I EFFORT WILLESTABLISH THE TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY OF SUCH A PUMP. TECHNIQUES OF FABRICATING A SMOOTH COCONUT CHARCOAL SURFACE WILL BE DEVELOPED, AND THE PUMPING AND REGENERATION PROPERTIES OF SAMPLE SUBSTRATES WILL BE MEASURED. ENCOURAGING RESULTS WILL LEAD TO A PHASE II EFFORT TO BUILD ONE OR MORE CONTINUOUS CRYOSORPTION PUMPS THAT COULD BE TESTED AT A DOE TRITIUM FACILITY.",

THE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE PROSTHETIC IMPLANTS ARE CLINICALLY UNSATISFACTORY AND AUTOLOGOUS GRAFTS MAY COMPROMISE THE SITE OF TISSUE ORIGIN. THE LONG TERM OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP METHODS FOR PROCUREMENT, TRANSPORTATION, PRESERVATION, AND TRANSPLANTATION OF ALLOGRAFT LIGAMENTS AND TENDONS IN A LIVING, VIABLE STATE. VIABLE TISSUE TRANSPLANTATION SHOULD RESULT IN ENHANCED PATIENT REHABILITATION AND LONG-TERM GRAFT FUNCTION. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THIS PHASE I STUDY ARE TO INVESTIGATE IN ANEXPERIMENTAL CANINE MODEL THE EFFECTS OF ISCHEMIA UPON ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT (ACL) VIABILITY, AND TO DEVELOP THE PROTOCOL FOR CRYOPRESERVATION, THAWING AND TRANSPLANTATION OF ACLS. ISCHEMIA STUDIES WILL BE PERFORMED WITH INTACT ACLS FROM DOGS, USING RADIO-LABELED AMINO ACID INCORPORATION INTO PROTEINS, AND HISTOLOGY FOR ASSESSMENT OF VIABILITY. INVESTIGATIONS OF CRYOPRESERVATIONWILL INITIALLY BE PERFORMED USING CULTURED ACL-DERIVED FIBROBLASTS IN ORDER TO RAPIDLY ASSESS THE OPTIMAL RANGES FOR CRYOBIOLOGICAL VARIABLES, SUCH AS FREEZING RATE AND CRYOPROTECTANT TYPE. CELLS AND TISSUES WILL BE ANALYZED HISTOLOGICALLY, ULTRASTRUCTURALLY, AND BY BIOCHEMICAL METHODS. FINALLY, AN INITIAL PRECLINICAL TEST OF CRYOPRESERVED ACL FUNCTION WILL BE MADE BY REPLACING THE ACL IN DOGS EXPERIMENTALLY. IN PHASE II WE WILL INITIATE A MULTICENTER, LONG-TERM (2 YEARS) STUDY OF CRYOPRESERVED ACL FUNCTION AND EXTEND THE INVESTIGATION TO INCLUDE ALTERNATIVE LIGAMENTS AND TENDONS.",

TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE WE WILL CORRELATE THE CONDITIONS OF THIN FILM DIAMOND SYNTHESIS BY PE-CVD WITH THE RESULTING AS-DEPOSITED MICROSTRUCTURE. THE THERMAL PROPERTIES OF THE FILMS WILL BE CHARACTERIZED TO DETERMINE THE DEGREE TO WHICH THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY IS AFFECTED BY DEPOSITION PARAMETERS AND SUBSTRATE MATERIAL. THE FACTORS THAT GOVERN THE ADHESION BETWEEN THE DIAMOND AND SUBSTRATE MATERIALS WILL ALSO BE INVESTIGATED. CHARACTERIZATION DATA WILL BE COMPARED TO DEPOSITION PARAMETERS AND SUBSTRATE MATERIAL TO DETERMINE WHICH PARAMETERS MOST STRONGLY GOVERN THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY IN CVD DIAMOND THIN FILMS, SUPPORTING A PREDICTIVE MODEL OF DIAMOND DEPOSITION PARAMETERS AND RESULTING PHYSICAL PROPERTIES. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE PROJECT A NUMBER OF DIAMOND SAMPLES WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO OUTSIDE ORGANIZATIONS FOR PERFORMANCE TESTING, PAVING THE WAY FOR SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS ENGINEERING IN A PHASE II SBIR PROJECT.",

PASSIVE DAMPING IS AN EXCELLENT MEANS OF SUPPRESSING UNDESIRED STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS. DISCRETE DAMPERS ARE ESPECIALLY WELL SUITED FOR DAMPING LARGE STRUCTURES WHICH ARE CHARACTERIZED BY LOW, HIGHLY DISTRIBUTED MODAL STRAIN ENERGY, E.G., A LARGE SPACE-BASED PLATFORM OR TRUSS. DISCRETE DAMPERS MAY TAKE THE FORM OF LINK DAMPERS, DAMPED JOINTS, OR TUNED-MASS DAMPERS. EACH OF THESE PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE PASSIVE DAMPING OF SPACE STRUCTURES. THE PROPOSED EFFORT IS DIRECTED TOWARDS ADVANCING THE STATE OF THE ART IN PASSIVE DAMPING OF SPACE STRUTURES BY DEVELOPING DAMPED JOINTS AND LINK DAMPERS. THERMAL CONTROL FOR THE VISCOELASTIC MATERIAL WILL BE DEVELOPED SO THAT THESE DAMPING DEVICES CAN BE EMPLOYED IN SITUATIONS WHERE THE THERMAL ENVIRONMENT IS WIDELY CHANGING. SINCE ONLY A SMALL AMOUNT OF VISCOELASTIC MATERIAL IS USED, VERY LITTLE POWER WILL BE REQUIRED. THE CAPABILITY FOR DESIGN AND PREDICTION OF DAMPING OF THESE PASSIVELY DAMPED COMPONENTS AND SYSTEMS WILL ALSO BE EXPANDED AND IMPROVED.",

THE FIRST CONCEPT IS NEGATIVE INFORMATION, WHICH MEANS ACCOUNTING FOR ALL SENSOR'S DETECTION CAPABILITIES AND TRAJECTORIES IN ADDITION TO THE CONTACTS WHICH THEY GENERATE. THE SECOND CONCEPT IS TRACK-TO-TRACK CORRELATION, WHICH MEANS THAT A NEW CONTACT IS ASSUMED TO CORRELATE WITH A STREAM OF PAST CONTACTS CALLED A TRACK WITH PROBABILITY 1, AND THIS TRACK MAY CORRELATE WITH ONE OR MORE OTHER TRACKS WITH PROBABILITY <1. IN TYPICAL AFLOAT CORRELATION STRATEGIES, EACH CONTACT IS TREATED AS AN INDEPENDENT EVENT AND IS COMPARED TO ALL EXISTING HYPOTHETICAL TRACKS WITHOUT REGARD TO PREVIOUS CONTACTS. OUR APPROACH IS FIRST TO DEVELOP PRELIMINARY MATHEMATICAL MODELS OF THE SURFACE PICTURE FUSION PROBLEM INCLUDING OPINTEL, ELINT, ESM, RADAR, AND SONAR SOURCES. NEXT, WE WILL DEVELOP A SET OF SCENARIOS REPRESENTING VARIOUS COMBINATIONS OF SURFACE TARGETS, DATA SOURCES, AND MOTION.

THIS IDEA HAS BEEN APPLIED THEORETICALLY TO THE DESIGN OF SAILPLANES AND TO SOLAR POWERED HIGH ALTITUDE LONG ENDURANCE (HALE) AIRCRAFT. MORE RECENTLY, IT HAS BEEN APPLIED TO THE DESIGN OF MICROWAVE POWERED AIRCRAFT. THESE STUDIES DESCRIBE ATTEMPTS AT ARRIVING AT INTEGRATED DESIGNS OF ONE CLASS OF AIRCRAFT USING THEN-EXISTING STATE-OF-THE-ART COMPUTER CAPABILITIES. NO ATTEMPT WAS MADE IN ANY OF THE CASES TO USE NEW PROGRAMMING TECHNIQUES DERIVED FROM ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) TO DEVELOP MORE FLEXIBLE SYSTEMS FOR THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF HALE AIRCRAFT. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO DEVELOP A GENERAL PARAMETRICSIZING CAPABILITY FOR MICRO-COMPUTERS USING INTEGRATED DESIGN METHODOLOGY IMPLEMENTING THE HALE METHODOLOGY AS A TEST CASE. THIS METHODOLOGY WILL INCORPORATE SOME DETAILED CALCULATIONS, MANY QUALITATIVE RULES-OF-THUMB AND CONSTRAINTS WHICH ARE NOT EASILY QUANTIFIED EXCEPT BY THE ACCUMULATION OF DESIGN EXPERIENCE. IN THIS REGARD, THE RESULTANT SOFTWARE WILL BE AN EXPERT SYSTEM FOR THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF HALE AIRCRAFT.",

A NEED EXISTS FOR A SEABED PENETRATING SENSOR SYSTEM OPERATING AT LOW FREQUENCIES, CAPABLE OF ON-BOARD SIGNAL PROCESSING AND ABLE TO TRANSMIT ACOUSTIC DETECTION INFORMATION TO THE SURFACE IN REAL OR NEAR REAL TIME. DEFENSE SYSTEMS, INC. (DSI) SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED ON DARPA CONTRACT A KINETIC ENERGY PENETRATOR TO PIERCE THROUGH 10 FEET OF POLAR ICE AND DEPOSIT A HYDROPHONE ARRAY, SIGNAL PROCESSOR AND RF TRANSMITTER SYSTEM THAT SURVIVED THE SHOCK OF IMPACT. DSI ALSO DESIGNED AND BUILT THE GEOBUOY, AN A-SIZE, AIR-DROPPED PARTIALLY PENETRATING GEOPHONE PROBE CONTAINING SIGNAL PROCESSOR AND TRANSMITTER. DSI DETERMINED THAT THE SAME TYPE OF KINETIC ENERGY PENETRATOR CAN ALSO PENETRATE THE SEA FLOOR TO MORE THAN 100 FOOT DEPTH AND CONTAIN A GEOPHONE SENSOR AND SIGNAL PROCESSOR. THE DETECTION INFORMATION WOULD BE TRANSMITTED TO A SUBSURFACE FLOAT TO WHICH A SURFACE FLOAT CONTAINING A TRANSMITTER WOULD BE TETHERED TO PROVIDE SATELLITE READOUT OF ACOUSTIC DETECTION INFORMATION. DSI DEVELOPED ESSENTIALLY EVERY SUBSYSTEM ON DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. IN PHASE I, THE SYSTEM WILL BE DESIGNED AND A SUB-SCALE KINETIC ENERGY PENETRATOR WILL BE BUILT TO TEST THE DESIGN PRINCIPLES AND TO SERVE AS A DATA COLLECTION DEVICE FOR COLLECTING SEA FLOOR SOIL CONSTANT DATA. IN PHASE II, A FULL UP SEA FLOOR PENETRATOR WILL BE BUILT AND TESTED.",

THIS RESTRICTS THE ENTIRE RESUPPLY MISSION. SWATH VESSELS ARE INHERENTLY LESS SENSITIVE TO SEA CONDITIONS DUE TO THEIR SMALL WATERPLANE AREA. THE SWATH TECHNOLOGY BASE IS WELL DEVELOPED. HOWEVER, THE APPLICATION TO THE LOTS MISSION REQUIRES CAREFUL STUDY BECAUSE SEVERAL ASPECTS OF THE SWATH CONFIGURATION COULD LIMIT ITS EFFECTIVENESS IN THIS APPLICATION. THE DRAFT AND LOAD CARRYING CAPACITY ARE THE PRINCIPAL CONCERNS. THIS STUDY WILL TAKE A TOTAL SYSTEM APPROACH TO DETERMINING THE TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY OF SWATH APPLICATION TO THE LOTS MISSION. IT WILL ESTABLISH FUNDAMENTAL DESIGN REQUIREMENTS; INVESTIGATE THE MAJOR CONFIGURATION TRADE-OFFS; INVESTIGATE FUNDAMENTAL LIMITATIONS; AND DEVELOP AT A FEASIBILITY STUDY LEVEL OF DETAIL ONE OR MORE SWATH CRAFT. THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY WILL CLEARLY INDICATE WHETHER SWATH TECHNOLOGY HAS POTENTIAL FOR IMPROVING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE LOTS MISSION.",

SUCH REACTORS ARE USED FOR BASIC RESEARCH IN THE STUDY OF NUCLEAR STRUCTURE AND HEAVY-ION REACTIONS. HIGH ENERGY TANDEM ION ACCELERATORS CREATE MEV POSITIVE ION BEAMS IN TWO STAGES. NEGATIVE IONS ARE CREATED IN THE FIRST STAGE AND ARE THEN ACCELERATED AND FIRED THROUGH A STRPPER FOIL. THE FOIL STRIPS AWAY TWO ELECTRONS, PRODUCING HEAVY POSITIVE IONS WHICH ARE THEN ACCELERATED IN THE SECOND STAGE TOWARD A TARGET IN THE ACCELERATOR'S END STATION. STRIPPER FOILS ARECURRENTLY MADE OF GRAPHITE AND AMORPHOUS CARBON. THEIR LIFETIMES ARE VERY SHORT (6 TO 10 MINUTES) WHEN BOMBARDED WITH HEAVY IONS. THE ACCELERATOR MUST BE SHUT DOWN TO REPLENISH THE STRIPPER FOILS. DIAMIND IS WELL SUITED AS A STRIPPER FOIL MATERIAL OWING TO ITS EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY, EXTREME HARDNESS, AND HIGH MODULUS. FURTHERMORE, ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTING BORON-DOPED DIAMOND WOULD PROVIDE LOW RESISTIVITY AND THUS MINIMIZE THE POSSIBILITIES OF CHARGE BUILDUP IN THE FOIL. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO ESTABLISH A CONTROLLABLEPROCESS FOR PRODUCING THIN FILM DIAMOND STRIPPER FOILS FOR HIGH ENERGY TANDEM ACCELERATORS. THE DEVELOPMENT EFFORT WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH A TWO-PHASE PROGRAM. PHASE I EFFORTS WILL DEVELOP A PROCESS FOR PRODUCING FREE-STANDING FILMS OF POLYCRYSTALLINE DIAMOND, 200 TO 1000 ANGSTROMS IN THICKNESS, TENSIONED OVER A CIRCULAR SUPPORT STRUCTURE. ACHIEVING HIGH NUCLEATION DENSITY OF VAPOR DEPOSITED DIAMONDFILM IS ESSENTIAL TO PROVIDING THE REQUISITE DIAMOND FILM UNIFORMITY. FILMS DEVELOPED IN PHASE I WILL BE DOPED WITH BORON TO CHANGE THEM FROM INSULATING TO ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTING. IN THE PHASE II EFFORT, PROTOTYPE DIAMOND STRIPPER FOILS WILL BE SUBMITTED TO SELECTED DOE NATIONAL LABORATORIES FOR TEST AND EVALUATION IN TANDEM VAN DER GRAAFF ACCELERATORS. BASED ON EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS, EFFORTSWILL BE MADE TO ENHANCE THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY AND STRENGTH OF THE FILMS TO PROVIDE IMPROVED LIFETIME AND PERFORMANCE.",

THE PROPOSED PHASE I EFFORT WILL DEMONSTRATE A NOVEL, ROBUST, INTEGRATED CONCEPT WITH MULTIPLE SENSOR CAPABILITY. FIBER OPTIC SENSORS HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO HAVE GEOMETRIC FLEXIBILITY. IN THE CASE OF PHASE MODULATED INTERFEROMETRIC TYPE SENSORS HIGH SENSITIVITY IS DEMONSTRATED AS WELL. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE SENSITIVITY OF MODE DIODE LASERS TO BACK-REFLECTED LIGHT AND TO THE SENSITIVITY OF CONVENTIONAL SINGLE MODE FIBERS TO ENVIRONMENTAL PERTURBATIONS, PROBLEMS SUCH AS CORRUPTION OF LASER FREQUENCY SPECTRUM AND FIBER POLARIZATION FADING ARE LIMITING FACTORS. THE PROPOSED PHASE I EFFORT IS TO DESIGN AND DEMONSTRATE A FIBER OPTIC SENSOR SYSTEM THAT UTILIZES MULTIMODE DIODE LASERS AS AN OPTICAL SOURCE IN A COHERENT DETECTION CONFIGURATION THAT ELIMINATES THE PROBLEM OF ENVIRONMENTAL PERTURBATIONS WHILE RETAINING THE SENSITIVITY OF PHASE MODULATED SENORS. THE PROPOSED DESIGN HAS THE FLEXIBILITY TO MULTIPLEX A NUMBER OF MINIATURE SENSORS MOUNTED ON ROBOTIC END EFFECTORS AND TOOLSTO MEASURE PROXIMITY, TACTILE PRESSURE (TOUCH), FORCE, TORQUE.",

THE BIOREACTOR TECHNOLOGY INVOLVES THE SCALE UP OF SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS FOR THE REPRODUCTION OF SELECT PLANTS ON A COMMERCIAL SCALE. AN IMAGE ANALYSIS SYSTEM COUPLED TO DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS SOFTWARE HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED AS AN APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY FOR THE RAPID SCREENING OF SOMATIC EMBRYOS, BUT THE PROCESS REQUIRES FURTHER DEVELOPMENT TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF THE IDENTIFICATION PARAMETERS. THE SUCCESSFUL IMPROVEMENT OF THIS METHOD WILL HAVE SEVERAL BENEFITS. IMAGE ANALYSIS CAN BE USED AS A TOOL FOR THE OBJECTIVE AND RAPID CLASSIFICATION OF LARGE NUMBERS OF SOMATIC EMBRYOS PRODUCED UNDER DIFFERENT CONDITIONS. THIS DATA WILL ALLOW THE INCREMENTAL IMPROVEMENT OF THE BIOREACTOR OPERATING PARAMETERS TO INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE BIOREACTOR EMBRYO DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. THESE STEP-WISE IMPROVEMENTS WILL REPLACE THE EMPIRICAL OPERATING OF THE BIOREACTOR WITH A RATIONAL OPERATION AND A LOGICAL PROCESS DESIGN.

THE CORN TRANSPOSON AC (ACTIVATOR), WHICH HAS BEEN USED IN GENE ISOLATION IN CORN, IS KNOWN TO TRANSPOSE IN TOBACCO, BUT EXISTING SYSTEMS FOR MONITORING THE ACTIVITY OF THE TRANSPOSON ARE LIMITED BY THE ABSENCE OF ANY PHENOTYPE WHICH CAN BE EASILY SCORED IN WHOLE PLANTS. THIS POSES PROBLEMS IN ASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SYSTEMS FOR GENE ISOLATION BASED ON TRANSPOSON MUTAGENESIS. WE HAVE ENGINEERED A USEFUL VISUAL ASSAY FOR AC TRANSPOSITION IN SEEDLINGS BASED ON SCORING SOMATIC EXCISIONS FROM A STREPTOMYCIN RESISTANCE GENE.

A NEW APPROACH HAS BEEN TAKEN TO TREAT THIS CONDITION WHICH PROVIDES A LEVEL OF PRECISION AND FLEXIBILITY UNOBTAINABLE VIA SURGICAL AND/OR PHARMOCOLOGICAL MEANS. THE WELL-ESTABLISHED TECHNIQUE OF ELECTRICAL STIMULATION TO PRODUCE CONTROLLED MUSCLE CONTRACTION HAS BEEN EMPLOYED IN A NOVEL WAY. A PROSTHESIS SYSTEM TO PRECISELY CONTROL EYE POSITION BY UTILIZING ELECTRICAL STIMULATION OF THE EXTRAOCULAR MUSCLES (EOM) IS PROPOSED. A USER WEARS GLASSES WITH MINIATURE INFRA-RED (IR) PHOTOSENSORS WHICH DETECT THE POSITION AND MOVEMENT OF THE EYES. EYE POSITION DATA IS FED INTO A SMALLPORTABLE MICROPROCESSOR WHICH DETECTS MINUTE DISCREPANCIES IN EYE ALIGNMENT AND SENDS CONTROL SIGNALS VIA TRANSDERMAL POWER TRANSMISSION TO AN IMPLANTED ELECTRODE IN THE EOM. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM HAS APPLICATIONS IN TREATMENT OF PERMANENT EXTRAOCULAR MUSCLE PALSIES AND CORRECTION OF CONGENITAL STRABISMUS. USED TO TREAT EOM PALSIES THIS SYSTEM HAS THE POTENTIAL TO RESTORE NORMAL VISUAL FUNCTION. USED TO CORRECT CONGENITAL STRABISMUS, THIS SYSTEM HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DECREASE COST OF TREATMENT BY ELIMINATING MULTIPLE SURGERIES AND INCREASE SUCCESS RATES THEREBY IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE.",

THE PERSONAL-COMPUTER (PC)-BASED WORKSTATION ENVIRONMENT FOR ATHENA WILL STREAMLINE AND AUTOMATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF INPUTDECKS, ASSIST WITH THE REVIEW OF ANALYSIS RESULTS, AND SIMPLIFY THE USE OF ATHENA FOR NEW AND INFREQUENT USERS. UNDER PHASE I, A PROTOTYPE WORKSTATION FOR DEVELOPING ATHENA INPUT DATA WILL BE IMPLEMENTED AND THE NEED FOR ENHANCEMENTS AND POSTPROCESSING EXTENSIONS TO AID IN EVALUATING THE RESULTS FROM ATHENA ANALYSIS DETERMINED. EXISTING EIKON SOFTWARE ENVIRONMENT, WHICH RUNS ON THE IBM-PC FAMILY OF MICROCOMPUTERS, WILL BE USED TO DEVELOP A MENU-DRIVEN INTERACTIVE EIKON/ATHENA PROTOTYPE. THE SOFTWARE WILL CONSIST OF A COMPLETE MENU STRUCTURE WITH ON-LINE HELP FEATURES, DESCRIPTIVE FORMS FOR ATHENA DATA INPUT, THE ABILITY TO CREATE MAINFRAME-READY ATHENA INPUT DECKS, AND A USER'S MANUAL. THE PROTOTYPE WILL ALLOW INPUT OF ATHENA STEADY-STATE RESULTS THAT WILL ALLOW ATHENA USERS TO VARY THE INITIAL STATE OF THEIR SYSTEM MODEL EASILY WHILEMAINTAINING A SINGLE MODEL DATA BASE. POSSIBLE ENHANCEMENTSTO THE PROTOTYPE THAT MIGHT EXTEND THE USEFULNESS OF THE ATHENA WORKSTATION WELL BE EXPLORED FOR POSSIBLE PHASE II WORK. SEVERAL METHODS OF POSTPROCESSING COULD BE DEVELOPED THAT WOULD FACILITATE THE REVIEW OF ATHENA RESULTS. THESE INCLUDE AUTOMATIC READING OF ATHENA OUTPUT, DISPLAY OF RESULTS ON X-Y PLOTS OR ON SYSTEM DIAGRAMS, AND COLOR MIMIC DISPLAYS OF TRANSIENT RESULTS. RULE-BASED EXPERT SYSTEMS COULD BE USED TO AID THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODELS AND PROVIDE ASSISTANCE IN INTERPRETING ANALYSIS RESULTS. EIKON/ATHENA COULD ULTIMATELY BE MERGED WITH A MICROCOMPUTER VERSION OF ATHENA TO BECOME AN INTEGRATED WORKSTATION. THE PROTOTYPE WILL DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF THE PROJECT, PROVIDE A USER FRIENDLY ATHENA WORKSTATION ENVIRONMENT, AND PROVIDE THE FRAMEWORK FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT.",

ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS TO THAT EFFECTIVENESS IS THE INABILITY TO ACCURATELY TRACK TARGETS FOR GUN OR MISSILE SHOTS DUE TO THE DEGRADING CHARACTERISTIC OF WING ROCK, A SELF-INDUCED, LIMIT-CYCLE OSCILLATION IN ROLL, SOMETIMES ACCOMPANIED BY COUPLED OSCILLATIONS IN YAW, THAT OCCURS NEAR THE STALL ANGLE OF ATTACK. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO DEVELOP THE CAPABILITY FOR PERFORMING EXPERIMENTS IN A WATER TUNNEL TO VISUALIZE THE COMPLEX VORTEX FLOW FIELDS OF AIRCRAFT-LIKE MODELS UNDERGOING OSCILLATIONS IN ROLL. EXPERIMENTS WILL BE PERFORMED TO VISUALIZE THE INTERACTION OF LEADING EDGE VORTICES WITH EACH OTHER AND WITH THE WING SURFACE USING DELTA WING MODELS VARYING IN SWEEP FROM 70 DEGREES TO 85 DEGREES. A FORCED-OSCILLATION-IN-ROLL APPARATUS WILL BE DEVELOPED. THE EFFECTS OF SWEEP ANGLE, LEADING EDGE RADIUS, OSCILLATION AMPLITUDE AND FREQUENCY, AND ANGLE OF ATTACK WILL BE EVALUATED. MOTION HISTORIES OF THE MODEL AND FLOW RESPONSE WILL BE RECORDED ON VIDEO TAPE. ATTEMPTS WILL BE MADE TO CORRELATE THE MOTION OF THE MODEL AND THE CHANGING STRUCTURE OF THE VORTEX FLOW FIELD. SUCCESSFUL DEMONSTRATION OF THE TECHNIQUE WILL LEAD TO FURTHER STUDIES OF MORE COMPLEX AIRPLANE CONFIGURATIONS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER APPARATUSES FOR ANALYSIS OF OSCILLATORY MODEL MOTIONS, SUCH AS PITCH, YAW AND CONTINUOUS ROLL ABOUT THE FREESTREAM VELOCITY VECTOR (CONING MOTION).",

PERFORMANCE PROJECTIONS OF THE AL/AIR FUEL CELL INTEGRATED INTO THE ART XP-21 AUV TESTBED VEHICLE WILL BE MADE. THE KEY TECHNICAL, OPERATIONAL, AND ECONOMIC ISSUES WILL BE EVALUATED BY BOTH ELTECH AND ART. A PLAN FOR THE EVENTUAL FABRICATION AND TESTING ON ART'S XP-21 TESTBED OF A WORKING PROTOTYPE IN PHASE II WILL BE INCLUDED WITH THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN. THE AL/AIR FUEL CELL PROVIDES ELECTRICAL ENERGY BY THE DISSOLUTION OF AN ALUMINUM ANODE AND THE REDUCTION OF OXYGEN (AIR) AT THE CATHODE. IT IS REFUELABLE BY REPLACING THE ALUMINUM ANODES, ADDING WATER, AND REMOVING BYPRODUCT ALUMINATE. THE AL/AIR FUEL CELL HAS A HIGHER ENERGY/POWER DENSITY THAN ANY OTHER FUEL CELL OR SECONDARY BATTERY, AND, AS SUCH, SHOULD BE IDEALLY SUITED FOR AUV APPLICATIONS.",

SIGNIFICANT ENHANCEMENT OF ENERGY CAPABILITIES CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THE PROPOSED NI-ZN SYSTEM, WHICH HAS AN ENERGY DENSITY ADVANTAGE OVER OTHER CANDIDATES SUCH AS NI-CD, BOTH GRAVIMETRIC (28-35 WH/#) AND VOLUMETRIC (2.0-2.3 VS. 1.1-3 WH/IN[3]). AS A RESULT OF A RECENT FUNDAMENTAL DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW CHEMISTRY FOR THE ZINC ELECTRODE IN THE NICKEL OXIDE-ZINC BATTERY, A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN CYCLE LIFE HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN ELECTROCHIMICA CORP. AND GOVERNMENTCONDUCTED TESTS ON VENTED CELLS IN THE 15 TO 225 AH CAPACITY RANGE. THE DEVELOPMENT OF A RUGGED LOW TEMPERATURE VERSION OF THE PROVEN ELECTROCHIMICA VENTED CELL DESIGN IS PROPOSED WHICH WOULD BE TAILORED TO SATISFY ANTICIPATED CHARGING (TRICKLE) REQUIREMENTS. SMALL 10-12 AH CELLS WOULD BE TESTED FOR PHASE I DEVELOPMENT AND 200 AH CELLS WOULD BE CONSTRUCTED TO SERVE AS INTERMEDIATE SIZE PROTOTYPES FOR FUTURE APPLICATION IN BASING SYSTEMS.",

SOME OF THESE SENSORS HAVE POOR DURABILITY AND CAN BE SENSITIVE TO THE ENVIRONMENT. THE CONCEPT STUDIED IN THIS PROJECT IS INTENDED TO OVERCOME THESE LIMITATIONS. IT INVOLVES THE USE OF MINIATURE, SOLID-STATE TRANSDUCERS TO DETECT CHANGES IN DIFFERENTIAL MASS FLOW AS THE FLOW ANGLE VARIES. INCLUDED IS A MICROPROCESSOR USED AS AN INTERFACE TO PROVIDE CORRECTIONS AND LINEARIZATION OF THE OUTPUT SIGNAL.

THIS WORK WOULD PROVIDE UNDERSTANDING OF EXPLOSIVES/PROPELLANTS SENSITIVITY TO UNPLANNED STIMULI SUCH AS BLAST WAVES, HIGH-SPEED FRAGMENT IMPACTS, AND HEAT. IT WOULD PROVIDE APPROXIMATE SOLUTIONS THAT LINK HOT SPOT FORMATION, THERMAL EXPLOSION, RESULTANT SHOCK FLOWS, AND CHEMICAL ENERGY LIBERATED, ALL IN THE \"MICROSCOPIC\" NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE HOT SPOTS, TO THE MOTION OF THE HOT SPOT-FORMING, \"MACROSCOPIC\" INCIDENT SHOCK TO PROVIDE A FEEDBACK MECHANISM. THE RESULT OF THIS ANALYSIS WOULD BE THE DERIVATION OF APPROXIMATE SOLUTIONS, BASED ON REASONABLY-DETAILED HOT SPOT FLOW DYNAMICS AND REACTIVITY, WHICH WILL SERVE AS CHEMICAL ENERGY SOURCE TERMS IN CONVENTIONAL HYDRODYNAMIC CODES USED FOR PREDICTING THE TRANSITION TO DETONATION IN EXPLOSIVES FOR ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS. THE NEW SOURCE TERMS WOULD REPLACE THE DIFFERENT EMPIRICAL SOURCE TERMS IN CURRENT VOGUE. BETTER PREDICTIVE METHODS ARE ESSENTIAL TOWARDS MEETING THE AIR FORCE/DOD NEED FOR DESIGNING INSENSITIVE MUNITIONS AS WELL AS SHAPED CHARGE AND SELF-FORGING FRAGMENT WARHEADS.",

WE HAVE FOUND THAT THE METHOD BY WHICH GIARDIA DEGRADE THE UBIQUITOUS NECLEOSIDE 5'-METHYLTHIOADENOSINE (MTA) DIFFERS FROM MTA CATABOLISM IN HUMAN CELLS. TO EXPLOIT THIS DIFFERENCE, WE SYNTHESIZED ANALOGS OF METHYLTHIORIBOSE (MTR), AND MTA CATABOLITE. ETHYLTHIORIBOSE (ETR), THE ETHYL ANALOG OF MTR, IS ACTIVE AGAINST GIARDIA SPECIES IN VITRO AND IN VIVO AND HAS NO DEMONSTRABLE EFFECTS ON CULTURED HUMAN CELLS OR INTACT MICE. THE ULTIMATE PURPOSE OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP A NEW CLASS OF SAFE AND EFFECTIVE AGENTS FOR THE TREATMENT OF GIARDIASIS. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF PHASE I OF THE PROJECT ARE 1) TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF ETR IN VITRO AGAINST SEVERAL STRAINS OF G. LAMBLIA INCLUDING AN ANALYSIS OF CYTOCIDAL ACTIVITY, 2) TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF ETR AGAINST G. LAMBLIA (IN ADULT MICE) AND G. LAMBLIA (IN NEONATAL MICE) IN TWO ANIMAL MODELS OF GIARDIASIS, 3) TO ELUCIDATE THE MECHANISM OF ACTION OF ETR, AND 4) TO SYNTHESIZE AND TEST ADDITIONAL MTR ANALOGS AGAINST GIARDIA.

THE DETECTION PRINCIPLE IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT INCIDENT INFRARED RADIATION PRODUCES A VOLTAGE ACROSS THE JOSEPHSON JUNCTION WHICH CAN SERVE AS A USEFUL DETECTOR OUTPUT. IN THE PRESENT WORK, BULK SUPERCONDUCTOR SAMPLES OF Y-BA-CU-OWILL BE PREPARED BY SOLID STATE REACTION METHOD. THIN SUPERCONDUCTING FILM ON A SUITABLE SUBSTRATE WILL BE PREPARED BY LASER INDUCED DEPOSITION TECHNIQUE USING PULSED EXCIMER LASER. IN THIS TECHNIQUE, THE U.V. LASER REMOVES MOLECULES (PHOTO-ABLATION) FROM THE SUPERCONDUCTOR TARGET WHICH ARE SUBSEQUENTLY DEPOSITED ON MGO SUBSTRATE WHICH HAS BEEN CLEAVED TO FORM A WEAK LINK. A MAJOR ADVANTAGE OF THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUE IS THAT DUE TO EXCELLENT SPATIAL QUALITY AND SHORT WAVELENGTH (O.28 MICRO) OF THE LASER, IT PROVIDES A PRECISE CONTROL OVER THE DEPOSITION PROCESS WITH SUBMICRON RESOLUTION. FOR DETECTION, INFRARED SIGNALS WILL BE MODULATED AND GUIDED THROUGH A OPTICAL FIBER TO THE DETECTOR. DETECTOR PERFORMANCE IN TERMS OF, RESPONSIVITY AND DYNAMIC RANGE, IN THE SPECTRAL REGION OF 1-10 MICRON WILL BE EVALUATED.",

THE DIRECT FLUORINATION PROCESS INVOLVES THE SELECTION OF A HYDROCARBON WITH THE PROPER STRUCTURE WHICH IS CONVERTED TO A FLUOROCARBON BY A CONTROLLED REACTION WITH ELEMENTAL FLUORINE. SINCE THE STARTING MATERIALS ARE HYDROCARBONS, NUMEROUS STRUCTURES CAN BE MADE DUE TO THE WIDE VARIETY OF MONOMERS AND SYNTHETIC TECHNIQUES AVAILABLE. SPECIAL EMPHASIS WILL BE PLACED ON SELECTING INEXPENSIVE STARTING MATERIALS SO THAT THE FINAL COST OF THE FLUID WILL NOT EXCEED THAT OF A CHLOROTRIFLUOROETHYLENE-BASE FLUID (CTFE).

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH ISTO STUDY THE FEASIBILITY OF AUTOMATICALLY SCHEDULING MULTI-MACHINE COMPLEXES ON A REAL-TIME BASIS AND IMPLEMENTING A UNIFIED COMPUTER SYSTEM TO PROVIDE NEW SCHEDULING TOOLS IN AUTOMATED SYSTEMS. WE WILL INVESTIGATE REAL-TIME SCHEDULING BY SEPARATING SCHEDULE GENERATION AND REGENERATION TASKS FROM SCHEDULE ADAPTATION/RECOVERY TASKS. WE WILL EXPLORE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HEURISTICS TO AUTOMATICALLY DETERMINE VARIABLE RESCHEDULING PERIODS, SCHEDULE ADAPTATION/RECOVERY PROCEDURES, AND SCHEDULE REGENERATION PROCEDURES. THIS RESEARCH WIL LEAD TO A NEW PRODUCT FAMILY FOR FACTROL, INC. AND IS MOTIVATED BY USER REQUIREMENTS DERIVED FROM APPLICATIONS OF OUR CURRENT PRODUCT, FACTOR, WHICH PROVIDES SHOP FLOOR SCHEDULING TOOLS.FACTOR HAS BEEN APPLIED SUCCESSFULLY IN AUTOMATED SYSTEMS, AND WILL SERVE AS AN IMPORTANT EXPERIMENTAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE RESEARCH.",

THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO ADVANCE THE FLEXIBLE EDDY-CURRENT ARRAY CONCEPT TO A POSITION OF PRACTICAL UTILIZATION. THE PRESENT LIMITATIONS OF THE INNOVATION ARE INSUFFICIENT RESOLUTION AND COVERAGE; CURRENT FABRICATION TECHNOLOGY DOES NOT ALLOW FOR SUFFICIENTLY SMALL PROBE ELEMENTS TO BE PACKED WITH SUFFICIENT DENSITY TO PRODUCE THEREQUIRED RESOLUTION AND COVERAGE. THE APPLICATION OF HOLOGRAPHIC INVERSION OF THE DATA OBTAINED FROM STACKED, STAGGERED ARRAYS WILL BE EXPLORED IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE RESOLUTION. A CLOSER PACKING OF THE ELEMENTS IS OBTAINED BY A MATRIX ELECTRICAL INTERCONNECTION SCHEME. THIS INVOLVES A MATRIX INVERSION OPERATION TO EXTRACT THE INDIVIDUAL ELEMENT RESPONSE FROM THE MIXED SIGNAL OF THE ENTIRE ARRAY.

PREVIOUS ROTATION SENSING SCHEMES ACTUALLY MEASURE THE LINEAR MOTION CAUSED BY ROTATION, SUCH AS, PENDULOUS ACTION OF THE DISPLACEMENT OF THE TIP OF THE CANTILEVER UPON DEFLECTION. THE MAJOR DISADVANTAGE OF THIS METHOD IS THAT IT CANNOT DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE ROTATION AND THE LINEAR MOTION OF THE OBJECT IN QUESTION. THIS RESTRICTS ITS APPLICABILITY TO SITUATIONS WHERE THE AXIS OF ROTATION IS WELL DEFINED. MOREOVER, IT DOES NOT ALLOW SPATIAL AMPLIFICATION, I.E., THE CHANGE IN THE OPTICAL PATH LENGTH DIFFERENCE IS EQUAL TO THE LINEAR DISPLACEMENT OF THE OBJECT. THE DIRECT MEASUREMENT OF ROTATION, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS INHERENTLY INSENSITIVE TO LINEAR MOTION AND ALLOWS A PATH LENGTH DIFFERENCE MANY TIMES THE ACTUAL DISPLACEMENT OF THE OBJECT. INTERFEROMETRIC TECHNIQUES BASED ON THIS PRINCIPLE ARE MUCH MORE SENSITIVE THAN THE PREVIOUS ONES. TWO DIFFERENT METHODS TO EFFECT THE MEASURMENT OF DIRECT ROTATION ARE PRESENTED AND THEIR COMBINATION SUGGESTED TO PRODUCE THE ULTIMATE ROTATION SENSOR. THIS CONCEPT IS EXTENDED TO ALL THE CONVENTIONAL INTERFEROMETER CONFIGURATIONS AND WOULD PRODUCE AT LEAST TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE IMPROVEMENT IN RESOLUTION AND SIGNAL TO NOISE RATIO OVER PREVIOUS INSTRUMENTS.",

MORE SPECIFICALLY, THROUGH A COMBINATION OF SYSTEMATIC INVESTIGATION AND INNOVATIVE USE OF A LIQUID METAL ION SOURCE IN CONJUNCTION WITH A FINE FOCUSED ION COLUMN, IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO GREATLY REDUCE THE ABSOLUTE AMOUNT OF ANALYTE REQUIRED FOR ANALYSIS, TO INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OFANALYZING THE ANALYTE MOLECULES, AND TO SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF COLLECTING THE ANALYTE IONS FOR TRANSMISSION THROUGH THE MASS ANALYZER. A SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME OF THIS PROJECT WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGICAL IMPACT ON BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH AND WOULD STIMULATE FURTHER ADVANCES IN HIGH-SENSITIVITY ANALYSES BY MASS SPECTROMETRY. MOREOVER, THE DEVELOPMENT OFA LIQUID METAL ION-FOCUSING COLUMN FOR ULTRASENSITIVE, LIQUID-MATRIX, SECONDARY IONIZATION MASS SPECTROMETRY COULD HELP THE NATION REGAIN SOME OF ITS TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC COMPETIVENESS IN THE IMPORTANT FIELD OF MASS SPECTROMETRY.",

THE CHARACTERISTIC USED TO IDENTIFY THE MOLECULE (IN ITS CHARGEDFORM) IS ITS ELECTRIC MOBILITY. THE TECHNIQUE EMPLOYING THIS CHARACTERISTIC TO IDENTIFY MOLECULES IS ION MOBILITY SPECTROMETRY (IMS), WHICH HAS BEEN UNDER DEVELOPMENT FOR ABOUT THE PAST 18 YEARS. THE TECHNIQUE IS EXTREMELY SENSITIVE, BEING CAPABLE OF DETECTING COMPOUNDS IN THE LOW PARTS-PER-BILLION AND HIGH PARTS-PER-TRILLION CONCENTRATION RANGE, AND DOING SO AT ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE. THE CONVENTIONAL IMS IS ESSENTIALLY A TIME-OF-FLIGHT SPECTROMETER FOR IONS IN AN ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE NEUTRAL GAS. A NEW METHOD IS PROPOSED WHEREBY, INSTEAD OF MEASURINGTIME-OF-FLIGHT, A RETARDING ELECTRIC FIELD IS USED TO STOP AN ION FROM REACHING THE COLLECTOR IN A STREAMING GAS MIXTURE WHICH IS USED TO CHARACTERIZE THE ION. THE LOWER THE MOBILITY OF AN ION, THE HIGHER IS THE FIELD REQUIRED TO ACCELERATE IT IN OPPOSITION TO THE FLOW DIRECTION. IT WILL BE DEMONSTRATED IN THE PROPOSED RESEARCH THAT A FIELD-DOMAINION MOBILITY SPECTROMETER CAN BE DEVELOPED WHICH WILL BE SMALLER, SIMPLER, FASTER, AND LESS POWER CONSUMING THAN THE CONVENTIONAL TIME-DOMAIN ION MOBILITY SPECTROMETER, SO THAT A COMPACT PORTABLE CONTINUOUS MONITORING INSTRUMENT CAN BE EVOLVED.",

THE STATE-OF-THE-ART LIMITATION ON THE USE OF FEM IS COMPUTER RESOURCES: THE METHOD REQUIRES THE SOLUTION OF A VERY LARGE SYSTEM OF ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS, CURRENTLY EFFECTED BY INVERTING THE JACOBIAN MATRIX, A PROCESS INVOLVING VERY HIGH COSTS IN COMPUTER TIME, IO AND PERIPHERAL STORAGE. THIS RESEARCH PROJECT AIMS TO INVESTIGATE AND IMPLEMENT A NEW MATRIX-FREE SOLUTION TECHNIQUE THAT OBVIATES THE COSTLY MATRIX INVERSION; THIS TECHNIQUE IS BASED ON A VARIANT OF THE CONJUGATE GRADIENT METHOD. RECENT RESEARCH AND TESTING ON SIMPLE PROBLEMS HAS INDICATED THE PROSPECT OF A DRAMATIC SAVING IN COSTS. SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION IN A FEM, FLUID DYNAMICS CONTEXT WILL VASTLY EXPAND THE RANGE OF FLOWS (TURBULENT, NON-NEWTONIAN, THREE-DIMENSIONAL) THAT CAN BE SIMULATED WITHCURRENTLY AVAILABLE HARDWARE.",

FLUIDYNE PROPOSES TO CONSTRUCT SUCH BARRIER WALLS WITH A NOVEL ONE-STEP PROCESS THT INVOLVES THE USE OF HIGH-PRESSURE WATER JETS AND SIMULTANEOUS INJECTION OF CEMENT POWDER AND OTHER ADDITIVES TO GENERATE SLURRY JETS. THE SLURRY JET OR JETS ARE MANIPULATED IN THE GROUND BY MOV-ING THE NOZZLE IN A PRESCRIBED MANNER SO AS TO CREATE CAVI- TIES OF DESIRED GEOMETRIES. THE SLURRY JET WILL BE THOROUGH-LY MIXED WITH THE SOIL MATERIALS AND LEFT TO SOLIDIFY AFTER A PRESCRIBED TIME PERIOD. BY VIRTUE OF THE DEMONSTRATED MATERIAL-CUTTING CAPABILITIES OF SLURRY JETS GENERATED WITH FLUIDYNE'S PROPRIETARY NOZZLES, THE CREATION OF CAVITIES IN THE GROUND CAN BE ASSURED AND THE DEPOSITION OF CEMENT GROUTCAN BE CONTROLLED WITH PRECISION THAT WAS HERETOFORE IMPOSSIBLE. THE PROPOSED PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO YIELD RESULTS THAT SHOW THE UNIQUE CAPABILITIES OF FLUIDYNE'S ABRASIVE WATERJET TECHNOLOGY. THE RESULTS ARE EXPECTED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE TECHNOLOGY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE IN-SITU FORMATION OF BARRIER WALLS IN THE GROUND FOR CONTAINING BURIED WASTES. WHEN SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED, THE PROCESS WILL HAVE MANY COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS IN SOIL STABILIZATION, UNDERGROUND WATER CONTROL, FOUNDATION CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE, SHORING AND EXCAVATION.",

ALTHOUGH SOPHISTICATED, THESE SYSTEMS STILL NEED DATA ON ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS FOR PROPER OPERATION. FOR THIS REASON, IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW THE TEMPERATURE OF THE SEA SURFACE IN THE VICINITY OF A SHIP THAT COULD BE THE TARGET OF ENEMY FIRE. AT PRESENT, THERE IS NO GOOD WAY TO MAKE THIS MEASUREMENT. THIS PROPOSAL PRESENTS A PLAN TO DEVELOP A SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT SYSTEM RESPONSIVE TO THE NAVY'S NEEDS. THE SYSTEM CONSISTS OF THREE PRINCIPAL SUBSYSTEMS: AN EXPENDABLE BUOY WHICH TRANSMITS SURFACE TEMPERATURE DATA TO THE SHIP; A LAUNCHER WHICH EJECTS BUOYS WELL AWAY FROM THE SIDE OF THE SHIP; AND A SHIPBOARD RECEIVER/DATALOGGER WHICH RECEIVES, STORES AND DISPLAYS THE TEMPERATURE DATA FROM MULTIPLE BUOYS. IN PHASE I, A PROTOTYPE SYSTEM (BUOY AND LAUNCHER) WILL BE DESIGNED AND BUILT. TO MINIMIZE DEVELOPMENT COST AND RISK, THE BUOY DESIGN WILL INCORPORATE KEY ELEMENTS OF TECHNOLOGY AND HARDWARE FROM AN EXISTING EXPENDABLE BATHYTHERMOGRAPH. THE SYSTEM WILL BE EVALUAGED THROUGH A SERIES OF INITIAL TESTS. IN PHASE II, ANY REQUIRED DESIGN REFINEMENT WILL BE UNDERTAKEN AND THE SYSTEM WILL BE TESTED EXTENSIVELY PRIOR TO PRODUCTION-ENGINEERING FOR QUANTITY MANUFACTURE.",

SILVER-TIN OXIDE FOR USE IN ELECTRICAL CONTACTS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF PRODUCT WHICH MIGHT BE MADE BY THE NEW PROCESS. BROADLY, ELECTROLESS PLATING MIGHT BE USED TO COAT OXIDES, METALS, OR IN GENERAL, COLLOIDAL PARTICULATES WITH A SECOND METAL. THE ONLY LIMITS ON THE SECOND METAL ARE THAT ITS SALTS MUST BE SOLUBLE AND THAT THEY CAN BE REDUCED TO METAL FROM SOLUTION. MICROSTRUCTURAL CONTROL IN THE RANGE OF 5 TO100 NM SHOULD BE POSSIBLE. THIS CONTROL WILL BE DEMONSTRATED IN THE SILVER-TIN OXIDE SYSTEM. THE PRINCIPLES OF ACCRETION OF A DENSE COATING ON COLLOLIDALNUCLEI IS THE BASIS FOR THIS STUDY.",

CURRENTLY, FRUCTOSAMINE CAN ONLY BE MEASURED IN SERUM IN CLINICAL LABORATORY ENVIRONMENTS BY NON-ENZYMATIC REACTIONS WITH NITRO BLUE TETRAZOLIUM (NBT) AT PH 10.35. THIS PROPOSAL, AN ENZYMATIC APPROACH TO FRUCTOSAMINE MEASUREMENT, IS MADE POSSIBLE BY GDS TECHNOLOGY'S RECENT DISCOVERY OF AN ORGANISM WHICH SHOWS DEHYDROGENASE ACTIVITY.THE ENZYME USES FRUCTOSAMINE AS A SUBSTRATE IN PRESENCE OF NBT AT PH 7.0-8.0 AND PRODUCES COLOR. BECAUSE OF ITS ENZYMATIC NATURE, THE METHOD WILL OFFER SEVERAL ADVANTAGES SUCH AS SPECIFICITY, ACCURACY, QUICK RESULTS AND CAN BE CONVERTED EASILY TO DRY-CHEMISTRY STRIPS FOR \"ON-SITE\" TESTING.

THE PROPOSED DETECTION RANGES ARE: 0-400 PPM CO, 0-50 PPM NO, AND O-20 PPM NO(2). SOLID POLYMER ELECTROLYTE CELLS REQUIRE ONLY WATER FOR OPERATION. THERE ARE NO HARSH CHEMICALS OR ELECTROLYTES THAT COULD ENDANGER PERSONNEL OR LEAD TO CORROSION CONCERNS FOR THE CELL AND SUBMARINE MATERIALS. DUE TO THE COMBINED ADVANTAGES OF A SOLID POLYMER ELECTROLYTE AND THE POTENTIODYNAMIC METHOD, THE INSTRUMENT WILL OFFER SIMPLICITY OF OPERATION, LONG LIFE, LOW MAINTENANCE, INFREQUENT CALIBRATION, AND HIGH SELECTIVITY, IN ADDITION TO SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN COST AND SIZE OVER THE CURRENTLY USED MONITOR.",

THOUGH THIS AIR FLOW IS DIFFICULT TO MEASURE DIRECTLY, IT CAN BE INFERRED FROM THE PATTERN OF AIR FLOW OR PRESSURE IN OR NEAR THE MOUTH, BY A PROCESS KNOWN AS \"INVERSE FILTERING\". HOWEVER, AN INVERSE FILTER REQUIRES A KNOWLEDGEOF THE TRANSMISSION CHARACTERISTICS OF THE VOCAL TRACT BETWEEN THE LARYNX AND THE MOUTH (OR FROM THE LARYNX TO THE PRESSURE/FLOW SENSOR USED) AND THEREFORE IS DIFFICULT TO APPLY IN MANY CLINICAL SITUATIONS. THIS PROPOSAL DESCRIBES A RELATIVELY SIMPLE AND ROBUST METHOD FOR PROCESSING A WAVEFORM OF THE AIR FLOW AT THE MOUTH SO AS TO PRODUCE A CLINICALLY-USEFUL REPRESENTATION OF THE LARYNGEAL FLOW THAT DOES NOT REQUIRES A HIGH LEVEL OF TRAINING TO IMPLEMENT. ITIS PROPOSED THAT THE METHOD BE IMPLEMENTED ON A MICROCOMPUTER AND COMPARED WITH ACCURATE INVERSE FILTERING FOR A VARIETY OF NORMAL AND ABNORMAL VOICE QUALTIES. ASSESSMENT OF THE SPEECH OF COMMUNICATIVELY HANDICAPPED INDIVIDUALS IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY ACTIVITIES PERFORMED BY SPEECH-LANGUAGE PATHOLOGISTS. THIS PROJECT EXAMINES THE FEASIBILITY OF A SEMI-AUTOMATED, COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM FOR THE QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF SPEECH TO BE IMPLEMENTED WITHCURRENTLY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY. THE ENVISIONED SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO ACQUIRE RAW SPEECH INPUT DATA, AS WELL AS A TRAINED CLINICIAN'S OBSERVATIONS, IN THE COURSE OF THE TESTING SESSION. THE SYSTEM FOLLOWS A TESTING BATTERY MODEL, EXAMINING SUCH FACTORS AS: (1) CLIENT'S BACKGROUND/HISTORY; (2) SINGLE-WORD ARTICULATION ABILITY; (3) SENTENCE ARTICULATION ABILITY; (4) RECEPTIVE ARTICULATION ABILITIES; (5) SPEECH MOTOR FUNCTIONS; AND (6) PERIPHERAL INTEGRITY OF THE SPEECH MECHANISM. AS A FIRST STEP TOWARD THE ENVISIONED SYSTEM, THIS STUDY IS COMPRISED OF A SINGLE-WORD ARTICULATION TEST FOLLOWED BY MISARTICULATION ANALYSES IN ORDER TO EXAMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH EXISTING SPEECH RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY CAN BE ADAPTED TO PROVIDE ANALYSES AT THE PHONETIC LEVEL THAT IS CONSISTENTWITH THE CLINICIAN'S ASSESSMENT OF THE CLIENT'S ARTICULATIONSKILLS. IF FEASIBILITY IS VALIDATED, PHASE II WILL BE DEVOTED TO IMPLEMENTING THE ANALYSIS ALGORITHM AND ASSOCIATED DATA MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE FUNCTIONS REQUIRED TO AUTOMATE THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS, AND FURTHER LEVELS OF ANALYSIS WILL BE DEVELOPED INCLUDING PHONOLOGICAL PROCESS ANALYSIS, PHONETIC CONTEXT ANALYSES OF ERROR SOUNDS, AND ACOUSTIC ANALYSES OF ERROR SOUNDS.",

TWO PARTICULAR OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROGRAM ARE TO SHOW FEASIBILITY OF SOLID STATE INSTRUMENTS, MEASURING RATE OF TURN AND ICE BUILDUP, IN RELIABLE, LOW COST CONFIGURATIONS. THE UNDERLYING STUDY WILL BE A SEARCH FOR NEW TECHNIQUES THAT OFFER LOW COST, SMALL SIZE AND POWER CONSUMPTION, SELF-CHECKING RELIABILITY, AND EXPECTED MAINTENANCE-FREE LIFETIME. IDEAS APPEARING TO MEET THESE CRITERIA WILL BE PURSUED. THIS PROGRAM IS AIMED AT INCREASING AIRCRAFT SAFETY, PARTICULARLY FOR SMALL AIRCRAFT FOR WHICH MAJOR INSTRUMENT SYSTEMS ARE NOT ECONOMICALLY POSSIBLE.",

WE WILL MODIFY OUR EXISTING RESPIRATION TRANSDUCER (WHICH MEASURES TEMPERATURE AND VELOCITY OF RESPIRED AIR) TO INCLUDE INFRARED MEASUREMENT OF WATER VAPOR. WE WILL THEN CONSTRUCT A LABORATORY TEST BED FOR PARTIALLY SIMULATING THE HUMAN RESPIRATORY TRACT (ONLY THE THERMAL CHARACTERISTICS WILL BE SIMULATED). THIS TEST BED WILL PERMIT CONTROL OF \"CORE\" TEMPERATURE AND CONTROLLED VARIATION OF THE TEMPERATURE, HUMIDITY, AND VELOCITY OF RESPIRED AIR. WE WILL USE THE TEST BED TO ACQUIRE DATA FOR DEVELOPMENT OF A NONLINEAR MODEL OF CORE TEMPERATURE AS A FUNCTION OF RESPIRED AIR TEMPERATURE, HUMIDITY, AND VELOCITY; PRELIMINARY RESULTS INDICATE THAT THIS WILL BE POSSIBLE. FINALLY, WE WILL CONDUCT MEASUREMENTS IN A LIMITED NUMBER OF HUMAN SUBJECTS TO COMPARE PREDICTED CORE TEMPERATURE (FROM RESPIRATORY PARAMETERS) WITH ACTUAL CORE TEMPERATURE (DIRECTLY MEASURED WITH BOTH A RECTAL AND ESOPHAGEAL TEMPERATURE SENSOR). SUCCESSFUL DEMONSTRATION OF THIS APPROACH WILL PERMIT NONINVASIVE, NONOBTRUSIVE CORE TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT WITHIN A FEW BREATHS. IN ADDITION TO USE WITH COMBAT CASUALTIES, THIS TECHNIQUE SHOULD ALSO BE USEFUL IN HUMAN WORKLOAD STUDIES.",

THE RESEARCH EFFORTS WILL BE DIRECTED TOWARD THE OPTIMIZATION OF THE CHOICE OF POLYMER/DYE MATRICES, IN TERMSOF NOT ONLY RESPONSE TIME, WHICH IS ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL PARAMETERS, BUT ALSO, SENSITIVITY, RELIABILITY, STABILITY, SELECTIVITY, AND AGING. THE MINIATURE SIZE OF THE SENSORS WILL BE PRESERVED BY EMPLOYING THE DESIGN IN WHICH THE SENSOR CHEMISTRY IS COVALENTLY BOUND DIRECTLY TO THE FIBER TIP.

RECENT WORK AT GUMBS HAS SHOWN THAT IT IS FEASIBLE TO CONSTRUCT NOVEL, SWITCHABLE LASER SHIELDING SYSTEMS WITH BROAD BAND CAPABILITY AND RAPID SWITCHING RATES FROM THIN POLYMER FILMS. IN VIEW OF THIS CAPABILITY, THIS PROPOSAL OUTLINES A RESEARCH PROGRAM TO DEVELOP AN IMPACT RESISTANT, ABRASION RESISTANT PLASTIC FILTER THAT WILL OPTICALLY SWITCH RAPIDLY AND PASSIVELY, WITH BROAD BAND CAPABILITY AND A POTENTIAL OPTICAL DENSITY RATIO OF AT LEAST 100. IF PHASE I IS SUCCESSFUL, A MORE INTENSIVE STUDY OF THE KINETICS AND MECHANISM OF THE OPTICAL SWITCHING PROCESS WILL BE INITIATED WITH MORE DETAILED CHARACTERIZATIONS OF THE OPTICAL AND BALLISTIC PROPERTIES OF THE PLASTIC. SUBPICOSECOND OPTICS DETECTION EQUIPMENT WILL BE USED FOR MORE PRECISE MEASUREMENTS OF SWITCHING SPEED AND FLASH PHOTOLYSIS WILL BE USED FOR DETERMINING THE LIFETIME OF THE DEVICE.",

THE NEW METHOD USES AN ULTRAMINIATURE DEVICE, INSTALLED IN THE MOUTH OF A SUBJECT, TO CONTINUOUSLY ACCUMULATE HORMONES FROM THE SALIVA. THE RATE OF ACCUMULATION AT ANY MOMENT DIRECTLY REFLECTS THE AVAILABILITY OF THE HORMONE TO TISSUE.THE TOTAL ACCUMULATION OVER SOME TIME (1 TO 10 H) REFLECTS THE TIME INTEGRAL OF HORMONE AVAILABILITY TO TISSUE. THIS IS ADVANTAGEOUS SINCE ESTRADIOL LEVELS IN THE CIRCULATION AND IN THE SALIVA FLUCTUATE WIDELY OVER SHORT TIME INTERVALS, AND ONLY 1- 2% OF ESTRADIOL IN BLOOD IS ACTUALLY AVAILABLE TO TISSUE. THE NEW METHOD, IF APPLICABLE TO ESTRADIOL, WOULD REPRESENT BOTH THE MOST DIRECT AND THE LEAST INVASIVE WAY OF DETERMINING THE ACTUAL DEGREE OF TISSUE EXPOSURE TO ESTRADIOL. ESTRADIOL IS A PRIMARY REGULATOR OF REPRODUCTIVE PHYSIOLOGY, AND CURRENT ESTRADIOL MEASUREMENTS ARE OF SOME USE IN PREDICTING THE ONSET OF THE FERTILE PERIOD AND THE TIME OF OVULATION, AND PREDICTING THEOUTCOME OF FERTILITY- ENHANCEMENT PROCEDURES. A MORE RELIABLE AND CONVENIENT METHOD FOR PREDICTING THE ONSET OF THE FERTILE PERIOD AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESSFUL CONCEPTION AND PREGNANCY WOULD POTENTIALLY FIND A WIDE MARKET.

THE CURRICULUM WILL INCREASE THE CHILDREN'S SENSE OF SELF-ESTEEM, THEREBY DECREASING THEIR RISK OF ABUSE, VICTIMIZATION OR DYSFUNCTIONAL BEHAVIOR. A CURRICULUM COMPONENT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSING CHILD SEXUAL,PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL ABUSE PREVENTION HAS BEEN DEVELOPED FOR KINDERGARTEN THROUGH THIRD GRADE, AND IS NOW BEING TESTED IN THREE SCHOOL DISTRICTS, USING MEASUREMENT OF CHILDREN'S ACTUAL CHANGE IN OBSERVED BEHAVIOR, WHEN PLACED IN SIMULATED RISK ENVIRONMENTS, FROM PRE-TO POST-TEST. THIS STUDY WILL BUILD ON THAT EFFORT BY BROADENING THE FOCUSOF THE CURRICULUM TO TEACH CHILDREN LIFE SKILLS THAT ENABLE THEM TO COMMUNICATE MORE EFFECTIVELY, UNDERSTAND AND MANAGE THEIR FEELINGS, MAKE DECISIONS AND CHOICES, RESIST PEER PRESSURE, AND KNOW WHEN THEY NEED HELP AND HOW TO GET IT. THIS EXPANDED CURRICULUM WILL BE PILOT-TESTED IN PHASE I, INTWO DISTRICTS NOW UNDER STUDY AND TWO NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS,UTILIZING A CLASSICAL EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN WITH PRE- AND POST-TESTING OF REPONSES IN SIMULATIONS.",

THE TECHNOLOGY USES A SOLID-STATE REACTOR WHICH ELECTROCHEMICALLY CONVERTS NOX INTO NITROGEN AND OXYGEN. INITIAL EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS INDICATE NOX REMOVAL RATES OF 95+% TO LESS THAN 1 PPM. ENERGY REQUIREMENTS ARE ABOUT 33% AND CAPITAL AND ANNUAL COSTS APPROXIMATELY 15% OF ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGIES. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED WORK IS A DESIGN STUDY OF AN IGR SOLID-STATE, ELECTROCHEMICAL REACTOR CAPBLE OF CONTROLLING OR ELIMINATING NITROGEN OXIDES FROM MILITARY INCINERATORS AND JET ENGINE TEST CELLS. FROM THIS DESIGN, A SMALL UNIT WILL BE CONSTRUCTED AND TESTED USING SIMULATED EXHAUST GAS STREAMS. THE RESULTING DATA WILL FORM THE BASIS FOR A PROCESS ECONOMIC EVALUATION WHICH WILL DETERMINE THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.",

THIS PROJECT WILL DRAW FROM EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE ESTABLISHED THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A WIDE BANDWIDTH COMMERCIAL PRODUCT (THE PSP-1000) ALSO BASED ON NB JUNCTION TECHNOLOGY. COST EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PROJECT STEMS FROM OUR UNIQUE CAPABILITIES IN NIOBIUM JOSEPHSON JUNCTION CIR- CUIT MANUFACTURING, INNOVATIVE COMPACT CRYOGENIC SUBSYSTEMS,ACHIEVEMENTS IN WIDEBAND (70 GHZ) LOW TEMPERATURE INTER- CONNECTIONS TECHNOLOGY, AND EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN MICRO- PROCESSOR-BASED SOFTWARE FOR CONTROL, DIAGNOSIS, AND SELF- TESTING OF JOSEPHSON JUNCTION CIRCUITS AND INSTRUMENTATION. TASKS PROPOSED FOR PHASE-I INCLUDE: (1) A MARKET ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY PERFORMANCE FEATURES AND ACCEPTABLE PRODUCT COST(2) TOP-DOWN PAPER DESIGN UTILIZING SURVEY INPUTS AND IDENTIFYING CRITICAL PATH ELEMENTS; AND (3) FABRICATION OF NB JUNCTION ARRAYS. PHASE-II PROTOTYPE \"BENCH\" VERSIONS OF A VOLTAGE STANDARD WILL BE BUILT UTILIZING INITIAL \"BEST DESIGN\" PARAMETERS. SUBSEQUENT WORK WILL FOCUS ON OPTIMI- ZATION OF THE PRODUCT FOR COST, PERFORMANCE, & FLEXIBILITY. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP AN EXTRACORPOREAL DEVICE TO REMOVE LARGE AMOUNTS OF CARBON DIOXIDE FROM A RELATIVELY SMALL FLOW RATE OF BLOOD. THIS DECARBOXYLATOR DEVICE COULD HELP SUPPORT PATIENTS WHEN RESPIRATORS FAIL TO REMOVE SUFFICIENT C02, OR BE USED IN PLACE OF RESPIRATORS IN PATIENTS WITH MODERATE C02 RETENTION. THE DECARBOXYLATOR SYSTEM WILL BE CREATED BY DEVELOPING A NEW DISPOSABLE PACKAGE FOR THE BIOLOGIC DIALYSIS MACHINE. THIS MACHINE IS DESIGNED TO PERFORM DIALYSIS THROUGH A SINGLE BLOOD ACCESS (SUBCLAVIAN CATHETER OR NEEDLE) USING A PLATE DIALYZER BOTH FOR CHEMICAL CLEARANCE AND FOR PUMPING BLOOD. WE WILL DESIGN A DISPOSABLE PACKAGE (DC PACK) WITH ASUSPENSION OF CALCIUM HYDROXYL WHICH WILL MOVE THROUGH A SCREEN PLATE DIALYZER IN A TO-AND-FRO MANNER TO MAINTAIN FLUIDITY. WITHIN THE DIALYZER, THE CALCIUM HYDROXIDE WILL EXCHANGE ITS HYDROXYL FOR BICARBONATE, REMOVING ALMOST ALL OF THE BLOOD BICARBONATE WITHOUT EXCESSIVE CALCIUM OR HYDROXYL RETURN TO THE BLOOD. IN VITRO TESTS DURING PHASE IWILL DETERMINE THE C02 REMOVAL RATE, CALCIUM RETURN, AND PH CHANGES CAUSED BY THE BIOLOGIC-DC SYSTEM. THESE STUDIES WILL INDICATE WHETHER THE SYSTEM HAS POTENTIAL FOR ASSISTINGPATIENTS IN RESPIRATORY FAILURE.",

THE LONG TERM OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK IS TO DEVELOP A NON-INVASIVE TREATMENT MODALITY THAN CAN BE USED TO TREAT OSTEOPOROSIS ORTHAT CAN BE USED PROPHYLACTICALLY TO PREVENT THE ONSET OF OSTEOPOROSIS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF UTILIZING RESONANT ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS TO STIMULATE OSTEOGENESIS AND THEREBY REVERSE THE EFFECTS OF OSTEOPOROSIS. OSTEOPOROSIS WILL BE PRODUCED IN THE RAT BY UNILATERAL SCIATIC DENERVATION. AFTER THE DISUSE OSTEOPOROSIS MANIFESTS ITSELF (28 DAYS POST DENERVATION) ANIMALS WILL BE PLACED IN ALIGNED DC AND AC MAGNETIC FIELDS FOR A PERIOD OF 42 DAYS. THE CONDITIONS ON THE FIELD WILL BE SET TO STIMULATE THE TRANSPORT ACROSS CELL MEMBRANES OF SPECIFIC ION SPECIES AND COMBINATIONS OF ION SPECIES. A CONTROL GROUP WILL RECEIVE THE SAME HANDLING BUT WILL BE PLACED WITHIN AN INACTIVE FIELD CONDITION. IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE OSTEOGENIC POTENTIAL RESONANT ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD TREATMENT THE WET WEIGHT, DRY WEIGHT, ASHED WEIGHT, ULTIMATE STRENGTH, CORTICAL AREA, CORTICAL THICKNESS AND CORTICAL POROSITY OF THE FEMORA AND TIBIAE WILL BE EVALUATEDIN THE TREATED GROUPS AS COMPARED TO THE UNTREATED CONTROL.",

THE PURPOSE OF THIS WORK IS TO DEVELOP INSTRUMENTATION FOR C-13 NMR SPECTROSCOPY OF HUMANS TO PURSUE FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH ON BRAIN BIOCHEMICAL DISORDERS SUCH AS SCHIZOPHRENIA AND TARDIVE DYSKINESIA. THESE STUDIES WILL BE CONDUCTED AT 2.1 TESLA AND 5.0 TESLA SO THAT S/N RATIOS, C-13 T1'S, DECOUPLER EFFICIENCY, NUCLEAROVERHAUSER ENHANCEMENTS (NOE) AND RF HEATING MAY BE COMPARED. WE PLAN TO UTILIZE GLUCOSE, ENRICHED WITH C-13 AT SPECIFIC POSITIONS TO DETERMINE IN-VIVO INTERMEDIARY METABOLISM OF THE BRAIN. THE RELATIVE QUANTITIES AND IDENTITIES OF C-13 LABELED METABOLIC INTERMEDIATES CAN BE FOUND BY CALCULATING THE CHEMICAL SHIFT AND AREA FOR EACH PEAK IN THE C-13 OR H-1NMR SPECTRUM. WE PLAN TO MEASURE THE INCORPORATION OF GLUCOSE CARBONS INTO LACTATE, AND THE EXTENT OF DILUTION OF GLUCOSE CARBONS TRAVERSING THE TRICARBOXYLIC ACID CYCLE WITHTHEIR SUBSEQUENT INCORPORATION INTO OTHER CARBON POOLS OF THE BRAIN, I.E. GLUTAMATE, GLUTAMINE, GABA, AND ALANINE. TECHNIQUES AND INSTRUMENTATION DEVELOPED AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS RESEARCH SHOULD BE TRANSFERABLE TO EXISTING \"HIGH FIELD\" (2.OT) WHOLE BODY CLINICAL IMAGING SYSTEMS FOR PHASE II HUMAN INVESTIGATIONS.

DETECTION OF ANTI-HELPER T CELL AUTOANTIBODIES WILL BE CORRELATED WITH AIDS RELATED DISEASE PARAMETERS AND THE CLINICAL COURSE OF HIV INFECTIONS. THESE STUDIES WILL BE CONTINUED INTO THE PHASE II PERIOD TO IDENTIFY THE ROLE OF THESE DIAGNOSTIC ASSAYS IN PREDICTING AIDS PROGRESSION IN HIV INFECTED INDIVIDUALS.

IT IS CHARACTERIZED BY ELECTRONIC TRANSITION PRODUCED BY THE ABSORPTION OF IR PHOTONS THAT CAN PROVIDE A MICROSECOND-RANGE RESPONSE TIME. RESOLUTION IS THEORETICALLY AT THE MOLECULAR-SIZE LEVEL AND IS LIMITED BY THE OPTICS AND NOISE LEVEL RATHER THAN THE MATERIAL BEING USED. IT DOES NOT REQUIRE CRYOGENIC COOLING AS IN MOST MECHANICAL SCANNING, IMAGING TUBE, AND FOCAL PLANE ARRAY TECHNOLOGIES IN THE 10-MICRON BAND. THE LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES AND SPECIFIC AIMS OF THIS PROJECTARE TO DEVELOP A NONINVASIVE THERMOMETRY DEVICE FOR THE ACCURATE MEASUREMENT OF TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION IN TUMOR AND NORMAL HUMAN TISSUES DURING HYPOTHERMIA TREATMENT WITH A SENSITIVITY OF 0.1 DEGREE C IN PHASE I. OPTIMIZATION GOALSOF PHASE II ARE TO ACHIEVE A FINAL SENSITIVITY OF 0.01 DEGREE C. THIS NEW PROCESS CAN ATTAIN A SENSITIVITY OF 10 MINUS 14 W SEC/CM2 AND HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED OFR A 10-MICRON VERSION IN THE LABORATORY. THIS IS AN INCREASE 10 TIMES OVER THE DETECTABILITY OF EXISTING IR-IMAGING AND DETECTION SYSTEMS",

PREVIOUS TESTS HAVE SHOWN THAT THE SURFACE FINISH AND SUBSURFACE DAMAGE IN SI(3)N(4) ROLLERS AND BALLS ARE CRITICAL AND MAKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF THE BEARING IN FULL SCALE TESTS. ION IMPLANTATION WITH CERTAIN ELEMENTS SHOULD LOWER THE SURFACE FRICTION BY FORMING A NEAR-SURFACE SOLID LUBRICANT LAYER IN ADDITION TO MAKING THE SURFACE LESS SENSITIVE TO SURFACE FLAWS. WE PROPOSE TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF VARIOUS TYPES OF IMPLANTED IONS ON THE MICROHARDNESS, WEAR, AND COEFFICIENT OF FRICTION OF SI(3)N(4) BEARING MATERIAL. SIMILAR STUDIES ON OTHER CERAMICS, SUCH AS AL(2)O(3), ALTHOUGH NOT SUITED FOR BEARING APPLICATIONS, HAVE SHOWN AN AMORPHOUS TRANSITION AND INCREASE IN FRACTURE TOUGHNESS AFTER ION IMPLANTATION OF CHROMIUM.

POWER SYSTEM RELIABILITY AND ECONOMY OF OPERATION REQUIRES ACCURATE MEASUREMENTS OF CURRENT, VOLTAGE, REAL AND REACTIVE POWERS. TYPICALLY, THE NUMBER OF MEASUREMENTS IS IN THE THOUSANDS. THE PRIMARY SENSORS, TRANSDUCERS, AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS IN THE MEASUREMENT STREAMS ARE SUBJECT TO DRIFT AND DETERIORATION WITH TIME, TEMPERATURE AND ENVIRONMENT. THEY NEED PERIODIC INSPECTIONS AND CALIBRATIONS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WOULD ATTEMPT TO REPLACE THE PRESENT PROCEDURE WHERE INDIVIDUAL INSTRUMENTS, RATHER THAN THE RESULTING MEASUREMENTS, ARE PERIODICALLY INSPECTED AND CALIBRATED ON LOCATIONS BY FIELD CALIBRATING EQUIPMENT, A PROCESS WHICH IS: LABOR INTENSIVE, UNTIMELY, INTRODUCES ITS OWN ERRORS, AND INTERFERES WITH NORMAL OPERATION OF THE POWER SYSTEM. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH HAS THE POTENTIAL OF REMOTELY IDENTIFYING DEFECTIVE INSTRUMENTS AND REMOTELY CALIBRATING MEASUREMENTS, THUS DRASTICALLY REDUCING THE EFFORT REQUIRED IN THE PERIODIC INSPECTION OF SEVERAL THOUSANDS OF INSTRUMENTS SPREAD OVER A WIDE AREA, AND SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF MEASUREMENTS NEEDED FOR POWER SYSTEM OPERATION.",

THE SPECIFIC AIM OF THE RESEARCH IS TO PREPARE RICIN A CHAIN IMMUNOTOXINS WITH A PANEL OF SEVENTEEN MURINE ANTI-HUMAN MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES, AND TO TEST THE CYTOTOXICITY OF THESE IMMUNOTOXINS ON HUMAN CELL LINES WHICH EXPRESS THE TARGET ANTIGENS. THE FIRST STEP WILL BE TO SCREEN THE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES FOR THEIR ABILITY TO MEDIATE CYTOTOXICITY USING AN INDIRECT IMMUNOTOXIN CYTOTOXICITY ASSAY IN WHICH A SECONDARY IMMUNOTOXIN, PREPARED WITH FAB FRAGMENTS OF ANTI-MOUSE IGG ANTIBODY AND RICIN A CHAIN, IS USED TO TREAT TARGET CELLS COATED WITH THE PRIMARY MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY. IMMUNOTOXINS WILL BE PREPARED WITH THE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES WHICH ARE CYTOTOXIC IN THE INDIRECT ASSAY BY CONJUGATION WITH RICIN A CHAIN USING THE HETEROBIFUNCTIONAL CROSSLINKER, N-SUCCINIMIDYL 3-(2-PYRDYLDITHIO) PROPIONATE. THESE IMMUNOTOXINS WILL BE TESTED IN DIRECT CYTOTOXICITY ASSAYS. BOTH DIRECT AND INDIRECT CYTOTOXICITY ASSAYS WILL BE PERFORMED WITH IN VITRO HUMAN CELL LINES. THE COMMERCIALAVAILABILITY OF THESE REAGENTS WILL PROVIDE BOTH BASIC AND CLINICAL RESEARCHERS WITH A SAFE, SIMPLE, AND MORE EFFECTIVEMETHOD THAN IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR ELIMINATING SUBPOPULATIONS OF CELLS IN VITRO. THE LONG TERM OBJECTIVE IS TO DEVELOP, AND MAKE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE, IMMUNOTOXINSWHICH CAN BE UTILIZED FOR SPECIFIC IN VIVO THERAPY OF HUMAN MALIGNANCY, AUTOIMMUNITY, ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME (AIDS) AND OTHER DISEASES.",

BECAUSE OF THE ENORMOUS MORBIDITY OF GONOCOCCAL INFECTION IN THE U.S., THE POTENTIAL FOR COMMERCIAL APPLICATION OF SUCH A TEST IS EXCELLENT. THIS PHASE I PROPOSAL EXAMINES THE FEASIBILITY OF TWO DNA \"PROBES\" AS DIAGNOSTIC REAGENTS. ONE WILL BE BASED ON THE DNA SEQUENCE OF A 26 BASEPAIR REPETITIVE ELEMENT FOUND IN THE GENOMES OF NEISSERIA SPP. A 21 BASE OLIGONUCLEOTIDE WILL BE COMMERCIALLY SYNTHESIZED AND ENZYMATICALLY BIOTINYLATED. THE SECOND PROBE WILL BE A SINGLE STRANDED DNA FRAGMENT OF THE GONOCOCCAL OUTER MEMBRANE PROTEIN III GENE. THIS PROBE WILL BE BIOTINYLATED CHEMICALLY. A RESTRICTION FRAGMENT OF THIS GENE DEMONSTRATING THE BEST SPECIES SPECIFICITY WILL BEDETERMINED BY HYBRIDIZATION ANALYSIS WITH GENOMIC DNA FROM SEVERAL NEISSERIA SPP. BOTH PROBES WILL BE EXAMINED FOR SENSITIVITY USING PURIFIED GONOCOCCAL DNA AND HYBRIDIZATION ANALYSIS ON NITROCELLULOSE. BIOTINYLATED DNA PROBES WILL BE DETECTED WITH COMPLEXES OF STREPTAVIDIN AND BIOTINYLATED ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE OR UREASE.

CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE IE METHOD, HOWEVER, SHOWS THAT UNDER MANY CIRCUMSTANCES IT CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT TO INVERT THE RESULTS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE. MUCH OF THE AMBIGUITY IN ANY DATA INVERSION PROCEDURE CAN BE REMOVED BY PLACING ADDITIONAL CONSTRAINTS ON THE INVERSION. THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS SUPPORT TO PERFORM FINITE ELEMENT (FE) CALCULATIONS IN ORDER TO CALCULATE THE IE RESPONSE FOR SEVERAL MODEL STRUCTURES CONTAINING CRACKS AND DISBONDED REINFORCING MATERIAL. THESE RESULTS WILL THEN BE INVERTED USING NO A PRIORI KNOWLEDGE OF THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE OR THICKNESS. IN MANY CASES, THIS WILL LEAD TO A VERY POOR QUANTITATIVE INVERSION. INCORPORATING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE STRUCTURE FROM OTHER NONDESTRUCTIVE MEASUREMENTS SUCH AS MAGNETIC, ELECTROMAGNETIC AND NUCLEAR METHODS WILL BE USED TO IMPROVE INVERSION OF IE RESPONSES.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A FLOW METERING TECHNIQUE IS PROPOSED BASED ON THE HYDRODYNAMIC PHENOMENON OF VORTEX FORMATION IN A FLOW CAVITY ADJACENT TO A FLOW BEND SUCH AS AN ELBOW. IT HAS BEEN DISCOVERED THAT WHEN A CIRCULAR CAVITY IS PROVIDED AT THE OUTER SIDE OF THE BEND CURVATURE OF THE FLOW BEND, A VORTEX WILL BE DEVELOPED IN THE CAVITY AND THE STRENGTH OF THE VORTEX INCREASES MONOTONICALLY WITH THE RATE OF THE BEND FLOW. THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE RATE OF THE BEND FLOW CAN BE DETERMINED BY THE VORTEX MOTION IN THE CAVITY. THE VORTEX STRENGTH IS DETERMINED BY A FREE ROTATABLE ROTOR IN THE CAVITY WITH ITS ROTATIONAL AXIS COINCIDENT WITH THE CIRCULAR CENTER OF THE CAVITY. THE ROTOR SO INSTALLED TURNSWITH THE VORTEX MOTION IN THE CAVITY AND ITS ROTATIONAL SPEED MEASURES THE VORTEX STRENGTH. THUS, THE BEND FLOW CANBE DETERMINED BY THE INDUCED ROTOR SPEED. THE PROPOSED FLOWMETERING TECHNIQUE MONITORS A SECONDARY FLOW TO DETERMINE THE MAIN FLOW RATE WHICH IS CONCEPTUALLY DIFFERENT FROM CONVENTIONAL FLOWMETERS WHICH MEASURE DIRECTLY THE MAIN FLOW AND CAUSE INTERFERENCE WITH THE MAIN FLOW FIELD AND NORMALLY A HIGH PRESSURE DROP. THE ADVANTAGE OF THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUE IS THAT THE FLOW METERING ELEMENT CAUSES LITTLE INTERFERENCE WITH THE MAIN FLOW FIELD. IN FACT, THE PRELIMINARY TEST SHOWS THAT THE INTRODUCTION OF A CAVITY AND A ROTOR TO AN ELBOW RESULTED IN A MORE FAVORABLE FLOW CONDITION AND A PRESSURE DROP REDUCTION FROM THE ORIGINAL ELBOW. THIS INDICATES THAT THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUE, WHEN SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED, CAN MEASURE FLOW WITHOUT CAUSING ANYADDITIONAL PRESSURE DROP TO THE PIPING SYSTEM OR EVEN A PRESSURE DROP REDUCTION.",

IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT N-LINKED OLIGOSACCHARIDES, ATTACHED TO ASPARAGINE RESIDUES AT SPECIFIC SITES ALONG THE MOLECULE, ARE ESSENTIAL FOR POST-RECEPTOR TARGET CELL ACTIVATION BUT NOT RECEPTOR BINDING. THESE SUGARS ALSO PLAY A ROLE IN DETERMINING THE HALF-LIFE OF THE MOLECULE IN CIRCULATION. WE PLAN TO USE THE TECHNIQUE OF SITE-DIRECTED MUTAGENESIS TO PRODUCE A RECOMBINANT HUMAN FSH MOLECULE THAT WILL HAVE ONE OR MORE OFTHE ASPARAGINE RESIDUES REPLACED WITH A SIMILARLY CHARGED AMINO ACID TO \"ERASE\" THE SITE OF N-LINKED SUGAR ATTACHMENT.PRELIMINARY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT REMOVAL OF SUGARS FROM THE ALPHA CHAIN SEVERELY DECREASE BIOLOGIC ACTIVITY. REMOVAL OF THESE SUGAR RESIDUES, BY MUTAGENESIS, WILL PRODUCE A LONG ACTING COMPETITIVE ANTAGONIST OF FSH, WHICH, WHEN ADMINISTERED TO HUMANS, WOULD BE EXPECTED TO RESULT IN AN ANOVULATORY STATE OR AZOSPERMIA. A MUTAGENIZED, RECOMBINANT HORMONE MAY BE PRODUCED IN LARGE AMOUNTS, WITH EACH BATCH EXHIBITING UNIFORM BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES. THEREFORE, THIS PRODUCT WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT CHOICE AS A REVERSIBLE CONTRACEPTIVE IN MEN AND WOMEN.",

A BIOREACTOR IS A SYSTEM FOR GROWING LARGE VOLUMES OF CELLS IN-VITRO AND HARVESTING THEIR BY-PRODUCTS SUCH AS MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES, ENZYMES, HORMONES, VACCINES AND OTHER PROTEINS FOR COMMERCIAL AND RESEARCH APPLICATIONS. THE BIOREACTOR TO BE DEVELOPED UNDER THIS SBIR GRANT WILL BE A COMPOSITE OF TWO REPLAMINEFORM MATERIALS, POROUS HYDROXYAPATITE AND POROUS SILICONE RUBBER. CELLS WILL BE GROWN ON THE HYDROXYAPATITE AND PERFUSED WITH NUTRIENTS THROUGH AN INTERPENETRATING NETWORK OF POROUS SILICONE RUBBER CHANNELS. HYDROXYAPATITE OFFERS BIOCOMPATIBILITY, CYTOPHILIA, HEAT AND MECHANICAL STABILITY AND ADSORPTION HIGH MOLECULAR WEIGHT PROTEINS. SILICONE RUBBER AS THE SEMIPERMEABLE MEMBRANE OFFERS BIOCOMPATIBILITY, HEAT AND MECHANICAL STABILITY, WETTABILITYAND HIGH RESPIRATORY GAS TRANSFER. THE SPECIFIC AIM OF THISPHASE I SBIR GRANT IS TO DEVELOP PROTOTYPE BIOREACTORS. THESE PROTOTYPES WILL BE EVALUATED BY SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY, PERFUSION TESTING, AND CELL CULTURING AGAINST FIBROBLASTS AND BACTERIAL CULTURES. THIS SBIR GRANT SHOULD IMPROVE THE MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCIES OF CELL CULTURING BY INCREASING CELL DENSITIES AND BY DECREASING MEDIA CONSUMPTION, POTENTIAL FOR MICROBIALCONTAMINATION, CAPITAL COSTS AND PURIFICATION LOSSES.",

AN APPLICATION REQUIRING SUCH PROPERTIES IS THEIR USE AS WINDOWS FOR ELECTRON CYCLOTRON RESONANCE HEATING ON THERMONUCLEAR FUSION DEVICES USING MILLIMETER WAVES. DIAMOND-LIKE FILMS OF EXTREMELY HIGH UNIFORMITY WITH INDEX OF REFRACTION THAT PEAKS AROUND THE VALUE FOR DIAMOND HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY PRODUCED IN THE LABORATORY.

THE USE OF SEMICONDUCTOR SUB-ARRAYS, 5 CM SQUARE, WITH 5 MM SQUARE ELEMENTS, WOULD ALLOW SUBSTANTIALLY SPHERICAL ARRAY SYSTEMS. THE PRESENT PROJECT WOULD DEVELOP FAST, EFFICIENT SUB-ARRAYS COMPRISING A CONVERTER LAYER WITH 100 DETECTORS, 100 AMPLIFIER CHAINS AND100 SCALER/READOUT REGISTERS LOCATED ON A FEW SLICES OF SILICON.

THE SAME SYSTEM MAY BE USED TO DETERMINE JOINT TORSIONAL RESISTANCE PROPERTIES, WHICH ARE IMPORTANT IN THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS OF BLOCK-JOINTEDMEDIA. THE ULTIMATE PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH IS TO RELATE JOINT MECHANICAL PROPERTIES TO ROCK MATERIAL PROPERTIES AND JOINT TOPOGRAPHY. THE FRACTAL DIMENSION OF THE JOINT SURFACE IS SUGGESTED AS A PARAMETER WHICH MAY AVOID CURRENT PROBLEMS INDESCRIBING THE ROUGH STATE OF A JOINT SURFACE.",

BECAUSE OF THIS DUAL FUNCTION THE OPERATION OF A RECOVERY BOILER IS PARTICULARLY DEMANDING. SUCCESSFUL COMBUSTION OF BLACK LIQUOR DEPENDS EXTENSIVELY ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DROPLETS FORMED ATTHE BOILER FIRING NOZZLE. DROPLET FORMATION AND SIZE, IN TURN, DEPEND ON THE VISCOSITY OF THE LIQUOR. EXISTING SENSORS AND INSTRUMENTATION DO NOT ALLOW ON-LINE MEASUREMENTOF LIQUOR VISCOSITY. THIS IS MOSTLY BECAUSE, AT HIGH CONCENTRATIONS, THIS LIQUID IS VERY VISCOUS, POTENTIALLY NON-NEWTONIAN, AND HIGHLY SCALE-FORMING. A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF RESEARCH ON THE PROPERTIES AND BEHAVIOR OF KRAFT BLACK LIQUOR HAS BEEN SPONSORED BY DOE. THESE STUDIES HAVE REVEALED THE DEPENDENCE OF THE DRYING AND BURNING CHARACTERISTICS ON THE SIZE OF THE DROPLET, AND HENCE ON THEVISCOSITY OF THE LIQUOR. THE RESEARCH HAS ALSO PRODUCED IMPORTANT NEW KNOWLEDGE ON THE BASIC PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF BLACK LIQUOR. THE DEVELOPMENT PLANNED HEREIN WILL BE BASED ON THIS WORK. A RELIABLE MEANS OF MEASURING BLACK LIQUOR VISCOSITY AT HIGH CONCENTRATION WILL PROVIDE A MAJOR MISSING ELEMENT FOR ACHIEVING DIRECT, ON-LINE CONTROL OF THE COMBUSTION PROCESS IN RECOVERY BOILERS. IT WILL FACILITATE THE USE OF HIGHER-THAN-PRESENT LIQUOR DRY SOLIDS CONTENTS IN THE FIRING OF RECOVERY BOILERS. BECAUSE OF THE HIGHER EFFICIENCY, A SAVING OF OTHER, PRIMARILY FOSSIL, FUELS WILL BE REALIZED. AN ADDITIONAL BENEFIT WILL BE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE OPERATING SAFETY OF THE BOILERS.",

UNFORTUNATELY, THE CAMAC BRANCH HIGHWAY, THE PARALLEL DATA BUS USED TO CONNECT CAMAC CRATES TO THE CONTROLLING COMPUTER, IS EXPENSIVE DUE TO THE HIGH COST OF THE CABLE AND CONNECTORS PRESCRIBED BY THE CAMAC STANDARD. THIS SYSTEM COST IS FURTHER ELEVATED BECAUSE THE BRANCH HIGHWAY MUST BE INTERFACED TO THE COMPUTER'S BUS BY A SPECIAL DEVICE (THE BRANCH DRIVER) THAT IS PRODUCED IN SMALLVOLUME. DRIVERS ARE AVAILABLE FOR ONLY A FRACTION OF THE COMPUTERS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THESE FACTORS HAVE COMBINED TO DISCOURAGE INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS OF CAMAC, AND TO RAISETHE COST OF PHYSICS EXPERIMENTS. THERE IS, HOWEVER, A VAST ARRAY OF CAMAC DATA ACQUISITION MODULES AVAILABLE WORLD-WIDE, WHOSE USE WOULD BE FACILITATED BY A LESS EXPENSIVE INTERCONNECTION BUS THAT COULD BE INTERFACED CHEAPLY TO THE MORE COMMON PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND WORKSTATIONS. SUCH AN INTERCONNECTION COULD BE PROVIDED BY THE ANSI STANDARD SMALL COMPUTER SYSTEM INTERFACE (SCSI) BUS. THIS BUS IS APPROXIMATELY TWICE AS FAST AS THE BRANCH HIGHWAY. SINCE IT IS A WIDELY USED STANDARD FOR MASS STORAGE DEVICES, LOW COST INTERFACES ARE READILY AVAILABLE FOR NUMEROUS PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND WORKSTATIONS. THE SCSI BUS PROTOCOL IS MOST EFFICIENT WHEN USED WITH INTELLIGENT PERIPHERALS. PHASE I WILL INVESTIGATE THE DESIGN OF AN INTELLIGENT CAMAC CRATE CONTROLLER THAT WILL COUPLE THE CAMAC DATAWAY TO THE SCSI BUS. PARTICULAR ATTENTION WILL BE GIVEN TO INCORPORATING A LIST MODE OF OPERATION, SO THAT THE CONTROLLER WILL PERFORM A PREDETERMINED SEQUENCE OF CAMAC OPERATIONS IN RESPONSE TO A HARDWARE TRIGGER SIGNAL.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         IN THIS PROJECT, A NOVEL ELECTROMAGNETIC HEAT AND EXTRACTION SYSTEM IS BEING DEVELOPED FOR ENHANCED RECOVERY OF HEAVY OIL AND TAR SANDS. THIS CONCEPT IS BASED ON THE DIELECTRIC HEATING OF UNDERGROUND DEPOSITS OF HEAVY OIL AND TAR SANDS AND SIMULTANEOUS RECOVERY OF HEATED PRODUCT BY A PUMP SYSTEM THAT IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE ANTENNA SYSTEM. THE PROCESS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY INSERTING AN ANTENNA APPLICATOR AND EXTRACTOR SYSTEM INTO A BOREHOLE AND ENERGIZING IT WITH AN RF POWER SOURCE. A SINGLE BOREHOLE APPLICATOR OR A MULTIPLE OF SUCH BOREHOLE SYSTEMS MAY BE USED FOR CONTROLLED VOLUMETRIC HEATING AND PRODUCT EXTRACTION. THE APPLICATION OF A MODEST AMOUNT OF ELECTROMAGNETIC ENERGY FOR HEATING AROUND AND AWAY FROM THE BOREHOLE IN HEAVY-OIL DEPOSITS WILL PROVIDE THE NECESSARY VISCOSITY REDUCTION AND COULD FAVORABLY ALTER THE LIQUID FLOW PATTERN AND PRESSURE GRADIENT THROUGHOUT THE RESERVOIR. PRESSURE GRADIENT AROUND THE BOREHOLE WILL BE REDUCED BY HEAT APPLICATION, THEREBY INCREASING OVERALL PRODUCTION RATES. SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN FLOW RATES CAN BE ACHIEVED BY EXTENDING THE HEATING PATTERNS FURTHER OUT INTO THE DEPOSIT BY USING AN ANTENNA ARRAY APPLICATOR SYSTEM. PHASE I CONSISTS OF A SCALE MODEL DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROCESS OF HEAVY OIL AND TAR SANDS EXTRACTION USING THE PROPOSED ELECTROMAGNETIC HEAT AND EXTRACTION SYSTEM. A LABORATORY MODEL, ANTENNA-LIKE APPLICATOR WITH AN EXTERNAL PUMP WILL BE IMMERSED IN HEAVY OIL AND TAR SANDS. MEASUREMENTS WILL BE MADE ON PRODUCTION RATES, AMOUNT OF PRODUCTION, TEMPERATURE PROFILES, ANTENNA IMPEDANCE, AND RF POWER LEVELS. THESE DATA WILL PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR THE DESIGN OF FULL SCALE FIELD EQUIPMENT FOR COMMERCIAL EVALUATION IN PHASE II. AN ANALYTICAL MODEL WILL BE DEVELOPED. THIS MODEL AND ITS COMPUTER PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE VALUABLE INSIGHT INTO THE ACTUAL POWER DELIVERY AND HEATING PROCESS AND GIVE A BASIS FOR BOTH ENGINEERING AND ECONOMIC ASSESSMENTS OF THE PROCESS.",

IN BOTH APPLICATIONS, THE USE OF MODELING IS PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE SINCE IT REDUCES RISK AND COST ASSOCIATED WITH ACTUAL TESTING.

NONETHELESS, IFHIGHLY EXPERIENCED NURSES' MENTAL MODELS COULD BE DESCRIBED AND SHARED WITH OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, QUALITY OF COMMUNICATION, EFFICIENCY, AND SPEED OF ACCLIMATION TO THE HOSPITAL ENVIRONMENT COULD BE GREATLY INCREASED. THE PROPOSED STUDY IS DIRECTED TOWARD DEMONSTRATING THE FEASIBILITY OF USING A CRITICAL DECISION METHOD FOR DEVELOPING DESCRIPTIVE MODELS OF NURSES' DECISION MAKING. WE PLAN TO EXAMINE THE CONTEXTUAL FACTORS, SITUATIONAL ASSESSMENT, DECISION PROCESSES, AND STRATEGIES INVOLVED IN THE DECISION MAKING OF HIGHLY PROFICIENT NURSES. INFORMATION OBTAINED IN CRITICAL DECISION INTERVIEWS WILL BESUMMARIZED IN A NURSING DECISION PROFILE AND THE VALIDITY AND UTILITY OF THE PROFILE EVALUATED BY BOTH HIGHLY EXPERIENCED AND NOVICE NURSES. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL EXTEND FINDINGS REGARDING DECISION MAKING IN NATURAL TASKS AND SETTINGS. IT ALSO HAS DIRECT AND SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR KEY AREAS OF NURSING INCLUDING TRAINING, ORGANIZATIONAL EFFICIENCY, SPECIFIC PROBLEM SOLVING, AND ACCLIMATION TO THE HOSPITAL ENVIRONMENT.",

THESE CLUSTERS WILL BE SYNTHESIZEDAND SUPPORTED ON PARTIALLY DEHYDROXYLATED NU-A1203 AND MGO. A VARIETY OF TECHNIQUES WILL BE USED TO ANALYZE THE PURE AND SUPPORTED CATALYSTS. THESE TECHNIQUES INCLUDE INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY, BET SURFACE AREA ANALYSIS, X-RAY DIFFRACTION, AND X-RAY PHOTOELECTRON SPECTROSCOPY.

ALTHOUGH ALL THREE CONFIGURATIONS ARE VERTICAL REACTORS, THE GAS DYNAMICS AND THERMAL PROFILES IN ALL THREE ARE DIFFERENT. THESE DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO LEAD TO VASTLY DIFFERENT SURFACE CONDITIONS AND INTERFACE FORMATION. THIS STUDY WILLFOCUS ON THE GENERATION OF A DATA BASE AND UNDERSTANDING OF III-V HETEROSTRUCTURES AND INTERFACES, ESPECIALLY IN THE GAAS/A1GAAS SYSTEM. A PRELIMINARY MODEL TO DESCRIBE INTERFACE FORMATION FOR THE DIFFERENT REACTORS OF INTEREST WILL BE DEVELOPED. THE COMPLETION OF PHASE 1 WILL IDENTIFY GROWTH EXPERIMENTS THAT NEED TO BE CARRIED OUT IN ORDER TO VERIFY THE MODEL. PHASE 2 WILL INVOLVE GROWTH AND CHARACTERIZATION OF HETEROSTRUCTURES TO FEEDBACK INTO THE MODEL, AND TO ALLOW PREDICTION OF INTERFACE FORMATION. THE COMBINED PHASES 1 AND 2 WORK SHOULD LEAD TO A UNDERSTANDING OF THE FUNDAMENTAL MECHANISMS INVOLVED IN INTERFACE FORMATION IN OMCVD. SUCH UNDERSTANDING WILL BE NECESSARY FOR THE DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF III-V DEVICES.",

FOR THE AIR FORCE APPLICATIONS THESE UTILITY SCR SYSTEMS ARE INEFFECTIVE. KSE, INC. HAS RECENTLY DEVELOPED A NEW SCR SYSTEM SPECIFICALLY FOR THESE HIGH TEMPERATURE APPLICATIONS. THE CATALYST OPERATES WITH PEAK PERFORMANCE AT TEMPERATURES OF AT LEAST 1100 DEG F. THE CATALYST IS HIGHLY ACTIVE AND SMALL AMOUNTS ARE REQUIRED. AMMONIA CONSUMPTION IS ABOUT TWOTHIRDS THAT OF CONVENTIONAL CATALYSTS. THE CATALYSTS CAN BE EMPLOYED DIRECTLY IN THE EXHAUST GAS OF STATIONARY JET ENGINES OR INCENERATORS. ELIMINATION OF HEAT EXCHANGE AND SMALL CATALYST VOLUMES RESULT IN SIMPLER OPERATION AND LOWER CAPITAL INVESTMENT. LOWER PRESSURE DROP AND LOWER AMMONIA CONSUMPTION REDUCE OPERATING COSTS. THE LARGE EXISTING EXPERIENCE BASE ON OTHER SCR APPLICATIONS SHOULD ALLOW RAPID SCALEUP AND COMMERCIALIZATION.

THE HIGH PRESSURES REQUIRED FOR HIGH RESOLUTION ARE OBTAINED BY CENTRIFUGAL FORCE, WHICH ALSO MOVES SAMPLES FROM A TRANSFER DISC TO THE CHROMATOGRAPHIC COLUMNS. A GRADIENT SEGMENTATION DEVICE CUTS ONE ELUTION STREAM INTO SMALL FRACTIONS WHICH ARE INTRODUCED EQUALLY INTO ALL COLUMNS. AN ELUTING DENSITY GRADIENT, WHEN COMBINED WITH CENTRIFUGAL FORCE, MAINTAINS THE SAMPLE ZONE, AND ALL SEPARATED ZONES INPOSITION, AND PERPENDICULAR TO A RADIUS THROUGH THE COLUMN. THE DENSITY GRADIENT ALSO KEEPS TIGHT ZONES AS THEY MOVE THROUGH THE FLOW CELL. TWO STREAM SEGMENTATION DEVICES ARE PROVIDED TO ALLOW, IN CONCERT WITH SUITABLE VALVING, FLOW IN EITHER INBOARD OR OUTBOARD DIRECTION THROUGH THE COLUMN. OUTBOARD ELUTION WITH THE FLOW CELL CENTRIPETAL TO THE COLUMN IS USED WITH GRADIENTS OF DECREASING DENSITY, WHILE ELUTION IN AN INBOARD DIRECTION IS USED WITH GRADIENTS OF INCREASING DENSITY. SINCE THE SYSTEM HAS NO PUMPS, RUNS MANY COLUMNS IN PARALLEL, AND USES ONE OPTICAL SYSTEM AND MICROPROCESSOR FOR DATA ACQUISITION AND ANALYSIS,AND PROVIDES ANALYSES AT A HIGH RATE, WE BELIEVE THAT THIS SYSTEM WILL, WHEN PERFECTED, SUPPLANT A LARGE FRACTION OF THE HPLC SYSTEMS IN PRESENT USE.",

THE TECHNIQUE USED WAS THE COMBINATION OF TWO OR MORE LASERS IN ORDER TO DRILL VERY CLEAN HOLES. THAT IS, HOLES THAT HAVE VIRTUALLY NO KERF AND MAINTAIN DIMENSIONALITY THROUGH THE THICKNESS OF THE MATERIAL. IN THE SAME VEIN, WHAT IS PROPOSED IN THIS PROJECT WILL BE THE USE OF A CONTINUOUS WAVE INFRARED CO(2) LASER IN ORDER TO HEAT THE AREA THAT IS TO BE DRILLED AND THE COMBINATION OF A 100 HZ VISIBLE DYE LASER TO REMOVE THE METAL FROM THE HOLE. THE CO(2) LASER TAKES AWAY THE RADIAL COMPONENT OF THERMAL DIFFUSION SO THAT THE VISIBLE LASER ENERGY IS NOT DISSIPATED IN THE RADIAL COMPONENT. ALL THE ENERGY OF THE PULSE LASER IS ABSORBED DIRECTLY IN THE AREA THAT IS TO BE DRILLED. BY USING THE PULSED TECHNIQUE, MATERIAL CAN BE REMOVED MORE RAPIDLY WITH EACH PULSE. THE PERIOD OF TIME FOR THE CO(2) LASER TO IRRADIATE THE SURFACE WILL VARY FROM MATERIAL TO MATERIAL INASMUCH AS THE THERMAL DIFFUSION OF MANY OF THE HIGH TEMPERATURE ALLOYS IS SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER THAN THOSE OF THE MORE CONVENTIONAL METALS. AT THE SAME TIME, ONE WOULD WANT TO DRILL THE HOLES WITHOUT DISTRESSING THE TEMPER OF THE SURROUNDING METAL. THE TEMPERATURE RISE CREATED BY THE THERMAL FIELD LASER MUST BE SET AT A LEVEL THAT WILL ENHANCE THE PULSED LASER EFFECTIVENESS AND NOT DISTURB THE CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF THE SURROUNDING MATERIAL.",

THE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OF THE NETWORK FOLLOWS THE EXPERIENCE OF THE CELLULAR RADIO TELEPHONE NETWORK. IN PARTICULAR THE CAPACITY COMPUTATION, THE CALL PROCESSING, THE CELL SIZES ETC. PROVIDE AMBLE GROWTH POTENTIAL IF THE NUMBER OF MOBILE SUBSCRIBERS GROWS. THE PROPOSAL POINTS OUT IMPORTANT AREAS WHERE COMMERCIAL CELLULAR TECHNOLOGIES ARE NOT APPLICABLE. THE LOGICAL STRUCTURE OF THE NETWORK FOLLOWS THE ISDN (INTEGRATED SERVICES DIGITAL NETWORK) APPROACH.

HOWEVER, TO DO SO ONEMUST BE ABLE TO MAKE A STABLE EMULSION IN THE WHICH THE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY OF THE GLA, EPA, AND DHA ARE PRESERVED. THE GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP STABLE EMULSION USING A NEW SERIES OF SEMI-SYNTHETIC PHOSPHOLIPIDS DEVELOPED BY LIPID SPECIALTIES. DUE TO STRUCTURAL ALTERATIONS IN THE POLAR HEAD GROUP OF THESE PHOSPHOLIPIDS, LESS ENERGY IS REQUIRED TO FORM STABLE EMULSIONS WITH WATER INSOLUBLE MATERIALS SUCH AS EDIBLE OILS CONTAINING GLA, EPA,AND DHA. WE WILL TEST FOUR HOMOLOGS OF THESE NEW SURFACTANTS AS EMULSIFYING AGENTS FOR BLENDED EDIBLE OILS CONTAINING GLA, EPA, AND DHA. THE SIZE AND POLYDISPERSITY OF THE RESULTING EMULSIONS WILL BE MEASURED AS A FUNCTION OFTIME AND STORAGE CONDITIONS BY QUASI ELASTIC LASER LIGHT SCATTERING TO DETERMINE THE STABILITY OF THE EMULSIONS. THEPRESERVATION OF THE BIOLOGICAL POTENCY OF GLA, EPA, AND DHA WILL BE TESTED BY THE RATE OF PEROXIDE FORMATION IN THE EACHDIFFERENT EMULSION. IF STABLE EMULSIONS CAN BE PRODUCED, THEN PHASE II TRIALS WILL FOCUS ON TOXICOLOGY AND NUTRITION STUDIES OF SUCH GLA, EPA, AND DHA EMULSIONS IN ANIMALS.",

HOWEVER, THE STRONG CHEMICAL REACTIVITY OF GRAPHITE IN OXIDIZING ENVIRONMENTS AT ELEVATED TEMPERATURES REQUIRES THAT GRAPHITESURFACES BE PROTECTED IN SUCH APPLICATIONS. A NEED EXISTS: FOR MODIFYING THE SURFACE CHEMISTRY OF GRAPHITE, FOR DEVELOPING NEW APPROACHES FOR THE IMPREGNATION OF GRAPHITE, AND FOR COATING GRAPHITE PARTS WITH PROTECTIVE CERAMIC COATING LAYERS. NEW ELECTROCHEMICALLY-BASED PROCESSES WHICH TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE HIGH ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY OF GRAPHITE HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO ADDRESS THESE NEEDS. MODIFICATION OF THE SURFACE CHEMISTRY OF GRAPHITE BY THE SURFACE SYNTHESIS OF VARIOUS OXYGEN- AND NITROGEN- CONTAINING FUNCTIONALITIES WILL BE ACHIEVED BY ANODIC OXIDATION OF GRAPHITE IN \"FLOWING\" AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS. SIMILARLY, THE ELECTROCHEMICALLY INDUCED IMPREGNATION OF GRAPHITE WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED FROM PRESSURIZED ELECTROLYTE \"FLOW\" THROUGH THEPOROUS MATRIX. IMPREGNANTS CONSIDERED INCLUDE: ELECTROACTIVE POLYMERS, METAL OXIDES, SOLID LUBRICANTS AND VARIOUS METALS. ELECTROCHEMICALLY DEPOSITED HEAT-RESISTANT COATING MATERIALS INCLUDE: OXIDATION RESISTANT ALLOY COATINGS (COCRA1Y), METAL OXIDES (A1203), CERAMIC COATINGS (TIB2), AND METAL-CERAMIC COMPOSITE COATINGS. THE ELECTROCHEMICALLY-BASED TECHNICAL APPROACH WILL BE COUPLED WITH AN INTENSIVE SURFACE AND BULK ANALYSIS OF THE VARIOUS MODIFICATIONS USING HIGH VACUUM ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES. STRUCTURE-PROPERTY-PERFORMANCE RELATIONSHIPS WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE THE TECHNICAL APPROACHES.",

THE PRODUCT GAS IS SEPARATED FROM REACTANTS AND BYPRODUCT WATER BY LIQUID ABSORPTION, AND THEN OXIDIZED AGAIN TO FORM A NO(2)-N(2)O(4) MIXTURE. (THIS MIXTURE IS THE FINAL PRODUCT, BUT IT MUST BE HANDLED WITH EXTREME CARE TO MAINTAIN CHEMICAL PURITY AND SAFETY STANDARDS.) A LAB-SCALE PROCESS WILL BE CONSTRUCTED AND PROCESS DATA WILL BE MEASURED, THUS DEFINING THE FLOW SHEET. A SIMULATION OF THE PROCESS WILL BE DONE TO DETERMINE THE MOST ECONOMICAL CHOICES IN OPERATING PARAMETERS. THE OPTIMIZATION WILL BE DONE ON A STATE-OF-THE-ART CHEMICAL PROCESS SIMULATOR (ELG., ASPEN, SSI, CHEMSHARE, ETC.).",

AN OVERVIEW OF THE STATUS OF CURRENT HEAT PIPE WORKING FLUIDS SHOWS THAT NONE OF THE CURRENT WORKING FLUIDS CAN BE USED OVER THE 450-700 K TEMPERATURE RANGE. BY PREDICTING THE LIQUID TRANSPORT FACTOR OF VARIOUS COMPOUNDS SEVERAL NOVEL WORKING FLUIDS WERE FOUND THAT CAN BE USED OVER THE 450-700 K TEMPERATURE RANGE. THE LIQUID TRANSPORT FACTOR HAS A PRONOUNCED EFFECT ON HEAT PIPE DESIGN. THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL EXPERIMENTALLY VERIFY THE PROPERTIES USED IN THE PREDICTION OF THE LIQUID TRANSPORT FACTOR OF THE NOVEL COMPOUNDS. THESE PROPERTIES ARE THE LIQUID DENSITY, LIQUID SURFACE TENSION, AND LIQUID VISCOSITY. IN ADDITION, THE THERMAL STABILITY AND CORROSIVE PROPERTIES OF THE NOVEL FLUIDS WILL BE DETERMINED. THIS WORK WILL DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF USING THESE COMPOUNDS AS HEAT PIPE WORKING FLUIDS.",

TITANIUM ALUMINIDES POSSES LOW DENSITY, HIGH STRENGTH AND GOOD OXIDATION RESISTANCE, BUT SUFFER FROM POOR ROOM TEMPERATURE DUCTILITY. THE MAJOR CAUSES FOR LOW ROOM TEMPERATURE DUCTILITY HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS (1) EXTENSIVE PLANAR SLIP AND (2) LIMITED NUMBER OF SLIP SYSTEMS DUE TO THE ORDERED CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF TI(3)AL. EXTENSIVE PLANAR SLIP LEADS TO STRESS CONCENTRATION AT THE GRAIN BOUNDARIES. SUITABLE MICROSTRUCTURAL MODIFICATIONS CAN BE MADE THROUGH ALLOYING AND PROCESSING TO CIRCUMVENT THESE PROBLEMS. WE PROPOSE A RESEARCH PROJECT TO STUDY THE STRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES OF MICEO-ALLOYED TITANIUM ALUMINIDES PROCESSED VIA RAPID SOLIDIFICATION TECHNOLOGY. TI(3)AL WILL BE ALLOYED WITH BETA STABILIZER, MO, AND MICRO-ALLOYED WITH BORON AND CARBON. MO WILL BE ADDED TO RETAIN CERTAIN AMOUNT OF BCC PHASE IN ORDER TO PROMOTE DUCTILITY. MICRO-ALLOYING WITH B AND C IS EXPECTED TO IMPROVE THE GRAIN BOUNDARY COHESIVITY. RAPID SOLIDIFICATION PROCESSING WILL LEAD TO AN EXTREMELY FINE GRAIN STRUCTURE, WHICH WILL REDUCE THE SLIP-DISTANCE TO DECREASE STRESS CONCENTRATIONS AT THE GRAIN BOUNDARIES. A RANGE OF ALLOY COMPOSITONS WILL BE STUDIED, AND THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF MODIFIED TI(3)AL WILL BE EVALUATED AS A FUNCTION OF HEAT TREATMENTS AND MICROSTRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION.",

THERE IS SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY FOR OTHER REINFORCEMENTS WHICH MEET THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS OF MATRIX SYSTEMS THAT CANNOT BE MET BY SIC WHISKERS AND OTHER REINFORCEMENTS. IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED THAT TIB2 IS STABLE TO THE HIGH CONSOLIDATION TEMPERATURE OF 1900-2150 DEGREES C FOR A SIC MATRIX. TIB2 WHISKERS WOULD RESULT IN SIC COMPOSITES WITH DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED TOUGHNESS AND STRENGTH. IN ADDITION, TIB2 WHISKERS ARE STABLE IN TITANIUM AND IS READILY WET BY MOLTEN ALUMINUM WITH STABILITY TO 900 DEGREES C. THE AVAILABILITY OF TIB2 WHISKERS OFFERS SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITYFOR BOTH METAL AND CERAMIC COMPOSITES WHICH CANNOT BE MET BY ANY OTHER REINFORCEMENT.

SINCE THE VALVE MUST ALSO BE NON-MAGNETIC, THE RESEARCH WILL ATTEMPT TO IDENTIFY SUITABLE MATERIALS FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF ALL MAGNETIC AND ORGANIC PARTS IN THE VALVE. A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE RESEARCH WILL BE TO REPLACE THE FLAT VITON SEAL WITH A NEW DESIGN OF TRITIUM-COMPATIBLE BALL MECHANISM. THIS IS PERHAPS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF THIS RESEARCH; HOWEVER, THE USE OF A SAPPHIRE OR RUBY BALL MECHANISM LOOKS PROMISING.

IN PHASE I, WE PROPOSE: (1) TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF SEQUENTIAL PARALLEL IMAGE ACQUISITION (SPIA) TECHNIQUES AS A METHOD TO PRODUCE HIGH RESOLUTION IMAGES OF THE BREASTSAND AXILLARY LYMPH NODES IN REDUCED TOTAL SCAN TIME. IMPLEMENTATION OF SPIA TECHNIQUES REQUIRES THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL COIL NETWORKS USING FOUR COILS EACH RECEIVING SIGNAL FROM A SINGLE BREAST OR AXILLARY NODE CHAIN. (FIG. 1) (2) LOCAL COIL DESIGN PRINCIPLES DEVELOPED IN CONNECTION WITH THE LOOP GAP RESONATOR WILL BE USED TO PROVIDE THE UNIFORM EXCITATION AND RECEPTION FIELDS NECESSARY FOR SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION OF FAT SUPPRESSION, CHEMICAL SHIFT AND CONTRAST OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES; INCREASE THE IMAGE SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO IN EACH REGION OF INTEREST; AND IMPROVE RESOLUTION BY DECREASING THE GRADIENT FIELD OF VIEW REGION OF SENSITIVITY. (3) PATIENT POSITIONING ISSUES NECESSARY FOR ENHANCED PATIENT ACCEPTANCEOF THE MRI BREAST EXAM WILL BE IDENTIFIED. THE TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS WILL BE DIRECTED TOWARDS AND EVALUATED IN REGARD TO SPECIFIC MEDICAL PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DIAGNOSIS AND STAGING OF BREAST LESIONS IDENTIFIED BY CLINICAL EXPERTS.",

A METHOD EMPLOYING INERT GAS INSERTION AND BLOOD CONCENTRATIONMEASUREMENT (BOTH INVASIVE) OF THE INERT GASES HAS DEMONSTRATED THE CAPABILITY OF MEASURING THE DISTRIBUTION OFLOW UNITS AND ACCURATELY PREDICTING THE RESULTING REDUCED ARTERIAL OXYGEN CONCENTRATION. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING A NONINVASIVE MEANS OF BOTH INERT GAS INSERTION AND ARTERIAL BLOOD CONCENTRATION MEASUREMENT FOR THE PURPOSE OF MONITORING THE SHUNT FRACTION NONINVASIVELY. A TRANSCUTANEOUS METHOD, ANALOGOUS TO THE TRANSCUTANEOUS METHOD FOR OBTAINING ARTERIAL OXYGEN ESTIMATES IS TO BE EMPLOYED. AN IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE IS THAT INERT GASES ARE UNDISTURBED BY TISSUE METABOLISM, WHILE SKIN METABOLISM, COUPLED WITH AN UNCERTAIN SKIN PERFUSION, CAN DEFEAT THE INTENT OF THE OXYGEN MEASUREMENTS. THIS GIVES THE INERT GASTRANSCUTANEOUS APPROACH A MAJOR ADVANTAGE IN THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE DEFEATED BY PHYSIOLOGICAL UNCERTAINTIES; HOWEVER, THEMAJOR PROBLEM WITH THE APPROACH IS THAT SENSITIVITY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SENSING UNIT EXCEED THE MINIMUM DETECTION LIMITS FOR THE MOST SENSITIVE GAS SENSORS AVAILABLE. THE MAJOR OBJECTIVES OF THE PROPOSAL ARE 1) TO EXPERIMENTALLY VERIFY THE SENSITIVITY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE METHOD, AND 2) CONSTRUCT A WORKING MODEL OF A SENSING DEVICEWHICH MEETS THESE SENSITIVITY REQUIREMENTS. A TECHNICALLY FAVORABLE FEATURE OF THE METHOD IS THAT ITS ACCURACY DEPENDSPRIMARILY ON GAS MEASUREMENT RATIOS AND THE RATIOS OF MEMBRANE SOLUBILITIES OF THE VARIOUS GASES.",

HEMODIALYSIS EMPLOYS AN ARTIFICIAL EXTRACORPOREAL MEMBRANE WHICH NOT ONLY RESTRICTS THE FREEDOM OF THE PATIENT, BUT IS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS SIDE EFFECTS. PERITONEAL DIALYSIS IS MORE NATURAL, UTILIZING THE NORMAL BLOOD CIRCULATION OF THE PERITONEAL MEMBRANE. A PATIENT ON CONTINUOUS AMBULATORY PERITONEAL DIALYSIS (CAPD) INTRODUCES A DIALYSIS SOLUTION, OR DIALYSATE, INTO THE PERITONEAL CAVITY SEVERAL TIMES A DAY THROUGH A PERMANENTLY IMPLANTED CATHETER IMBEDDED IN THE ABDOMINAL WALL. THE PERITONEAL DIALYSIS SYSTEM INCLUDES AN ADMINISTRATION SET WHICH CONNECTS THE CATHETER TO THE SOLUTION CONTAINER. MAINTENANCE OF STERILITY THROUGHOUT THIS CIRCUIT IS PARAMOUNT, ESPECIALLY DURING THE DISCONNECT/CONNECT PROCEDURE TO DRAIN OLD FLUID AND THEN INFUSE NEW DIALYSATE. PERITONITIS IS THE MAJOR PROBLEM WITH PERITONEALAND HAS BEEN ADDRESSED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF PROCEDURES THAT CHEMICALLY DISINFECT THE CATHETER-TO-CONTAINER CONNECTION OR DISINFECT THE CONNECTION USING ULTRAVIOLET ENERGY. AUTOCLAVING OF THIS CONNECTION BY AN EASY-TO-USE, AUTOMATIC PROCEDURE HAS YET TO BE OFFERED TO THE CAPD PATIENT. SUCH A METHOD COULD STERILIZE RATHER THAN SIMPLY DISINFECT THE INTERIOR OF THE CONNECTION WITHOUT THE RISK OF LEAVING CHEMICAL RESIDUALS IN THE DIALYSIS PATHWAY. THE PROPOSED PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO DEVELOP AND EVALUATE AN EASY-TO-USE APPARATUS THAT CAN SAFELY REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF PERITONITIS BY USING HEAT INDUCED BY MICROWAVE ENERGY TO DIRECTLY STEAM-STERILIZE THE INSIDE PORTIONS OF A CATHETER CONNECTION FILLED ONLY WITH WATER OR DIALYSATE.",

OUR TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES ARE TWO-FOLD: 1) TO CONSIDER A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE OF DISCRETE NONLINEAR FILTERING, ANALYZE THE PARALLELISM IN THE DISCRETE FILTERING ALGORITHM, AND DEVELOP NEW ALGORITHMS FOR PARALLEL PROCESSORS COUPLED WITH A THEORETICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE TYPES OF ARCHITECTURES ON WHICH THE FILTERING ALGORITHM WOULD PERFORM BEST; AND 2) TO IMPLEMENT AND EVALUATE SELECTED ALGORITHMS ON A MOTOROLA 68020-BASED PARALLEL MACHINE IN ORDER TO EXPERIMENTALLY VERIFY THE UTILITY OF THE NEW ALGORITHMS. THE DISCRETE FILTERING ALGORITHM WE PROPOSE TO ANALYZE IS A NON-LINEAR TRACKER PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED BY METRON. WE WILL SHOW THAT THE DISCRETE FILTERING ALGORITHM IS MASSIVELY PARALLEL, AND THAT MOST OF THE OPERATIONS COULD BE CARRIED OUT BY A SIMD COMPUTER USING A RECTANGULAR ARRAY OF PROCESSORS. HOWEVER, SEVERAL STEPS IN THE ALGORITHM REQUIRE NON-TRIVAL INTERPROCESSOR COMMUNICATION, SO THE OPTIMAL PROCESSOR INTERCONNECTION SCHEME IS NOT OBVIOUS.",

RECENT DISCOVERY OF HIGH-TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTIVITY IN BA-LA-CU-O, Y-BA-CU-O, AND A NUMBER OF TERNARY OXIDES CONTAINING RARE EARTH ELEMENTS, WITH CRITICAL TEMPERATURES ABOVE 90K, PROMISES SIGNIFICANT ADVANCEMENTS IN NUMEROUS ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC APPLICATIONS. MICROWAVE MONOLITHICS INCORPORATED PROPOSES THE STUDY AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE APPLICATION OF THESE CERAMIC SUPERCONDUCTING MATERIALS TO MONOLITHIC MICROWAVE AND MM-WAVE INTEGRATED CIRCUITS, LEADING TO BREAKTHROUGH PERFORMANCE AND REVOLUTIONARY CIRCUIT FUNCTIONS. IMMENSE IMPROVEMENT IN PERFORMANCE OF GAAS MMICS IS EXPECTED BY REPLACING METALLIZATION WITH SUPERCONDUCTORS. NEW CIRCUIT FUNCTIONS HERETOFORE NOT POSSIBLE DUE TO FINITE CONDUCTOR RESISTIVITY ARE ANTICIPATED. FOR EXAMPLE, VERY EFFICIENT POWER COMBINING MAY BE ACHIEVED THROUGH VIRTUAL ELIMINATION OF CIRCUIT LOSS, LEADING TO LOWER PRIME POWER REQUIREMENT FOR THE SAME PERFORMANCE, AND HIGHER RF PERFORMANCE IS POSSIBLE USING THE SAME DC POWER SOURCE. VERY COMPACT HIGH PERFORMANCE FILTERS MAY BE REALIZED THROUGH MONOLITHIC INTEGRATION OF SUPERCONDUCTING CIRCUIT ELEMENTS. CRITICAL TEMPERATURES ABOVE THE BOILING POINT OF LIQUID NITROGEN (77K) ASSURE OPERATION WITH PROVEN REFRIGERATION TECHNIQUES. ACTIVE COOLING MAY INDEED NOT BE NECESSARY IN SPACE APPLICATIONS. INCORPORATION OF HIGH-TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTORS INTO MONOLITHIC MICROWAVE AND MM-WAVE INTEGRATED CIRCUITS WILL OPEN UP A NEW ERA OF HIGH PERFORMANCE AND FUNCTION VERSATILITY WHICH WILL GREATLY BENEFIT IMPORTANT NASA SYSTEMS AND OTHER APPLICATIONS.

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER KINEMATIC PROFILES OF LIMB TRAJECTORIES CAN BE USED TO DISTINGUISH NORMAL FROM ABNORMAL MOVEMENT IN INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN. FIRST, THE DEVELOPMENT OF UPPER EXTREMITY MOTOR CONTROL WILL BE INVESTIGATED BY USING KINEMATIC PROFILES TO STUDY VISUALLY-GUIDED REACHING TO A TOY TARGET. SECOND, KINEMATIC ANALYSIS OF LIMB TRAJECTORIES WILL BE COMPARED WITH CONVENTIONAL MEASURES TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS BETTER ABLE TO REVEAL INFANT MOVEMENT ABNORMALITIES. THIRD, NEW THERAPEUTIC PROCEDURES WILL BE DEVELOPED TO REMEDIATE MOTOR FUNCTION BY MODIFYING ABNORMAL TRAJECTORIES THROUGH OPERANT LEARNING OF NORMALIZED MOVEMENT. THESE GOALS WILL BE ACHIEVED BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPUTERIZED KINEMATIC DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM (KIDS). THE SYSTEMWILL CONSIST OF A SPECIALLY DESIGNED CHAIR TO FACILITATE OPTIMAL POSITIONING OF THE SUBJECT, A REACHING DEVICE FOR TARGET PRESENTATION, A KINEMATIC RECORDER FOR ACQUISITION OFTRAJECTORY DATA, AND A COMPUTER. SIGNIFICANT MOVEMENT PARAMETERS WILL BE IDENTIFIED, AND SOFTWARE WILL BE IMPLEMENTED FOR ANALYZING TRAJECTORY SIGNALS. THE RESULTS WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO A BIOMECHANICAL MODEL OF NORMAL AND ABNORMAL MOVEMENT. THE POTENTIAL OF THE KIDS TO REALIZETHE AIMS OF THE PROJECT WILL BE EVALUATED IN NORMAL AND CEREBRAL PALSIED CHILDREN OF VARIOUS AGE GROUPS. IF THE KIDS IS ABLE TO MEASURE MOTOR ABILITIES IN A PEDIATRIC POPULATION WITH GREATER SPECIFICITY THAN IS POSSIBLE WITH TRADITIONAL INDICES, IT WILL HAVE WIDE COMMERCIAL APPLICATION AS A DIAGNOSTIC TOOL FOR MANY FORMS OF UPPER LIMB MOTOR IMPAIRMENT IN BOTH ADULTS AND CHILDREN.",

THE PHASE I WORK WILL: 1) PRODUCE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR COLOR CODING AND ONE OR MORE COLOR SETS FOR THE E-2C EMDU; 2) DEMONSTRATE THE PRACTICALITY AND UTILITY OF A RULE BASED PROCEDURE FOR COLOR CODING SPECIFICATION AND AN ALGORITHMIC PROCEDURE FOR SELECTION OF MAXIMALLY DISCRIMINABLE COLORS. THE CODING RULES WILL BE DEVELOPED FROM CURRENT COLOR CODING PRINCIPLES. THE COLOR SET SPECIFICATION (IN CIE 1931 OR 1976 CIELUV CHROMATICITY COORDINATES) WILL BE THE PRODUCT OF A COLOR DIFFERENCE ALGORITHM TO BE DEVELOPED FROM RECENTLY PUBLISHED RESEARCH ON COLOR SELECTION. IN PHASE II THE CODING RULES AND COLOR SELECTION ALGORITHM DEVELOPED IN PHASE I WILL BE INTEGRATED,AND PARTIALLY AUTOMATED TO PRODUCE A RELATIVELY SIMPLE AND EASILY USED COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN/EXPERT SYSTEM FOR DETERMINING COLOR CODING SUITES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF MILITARY AIRCRAFT DISPLAYS. THIS SYSTEM WILL ALLOW DESIGN ENGINEERS AND OTHERS TO MAKE OPTIMAL USE OF COLOR TO HIGHLIGHT, GROUP AND SEGREGATED INFORMATION IN COMPLEX, MULTIDIMENSIONAL DISPLAYS.",

THIS RESEARCH EXAMINES THE FEASIBILITY OF USING AN ARRAY OF SEMICONDUCTOR SENSORS TOGETHER WITH PATTERN RECOGNITION SOFTWARE TO MONITOR CONTAMINANTS. SEMICONDUCTOR SENSORS ARE HIGHLY SENSITIVE, RUGGED, STABLE, AND SMALL, BUT UNTIL NOW THEIR USEFULNESS HAS BEEN LIMITED BY THEIR LACK OF SELECTIVITY. THE APPLICANT RECENTLY SOLVED THIS PROBLEM BY USING AN ARRAYOF THESE SEMICONDUCTOR SENSORS WITH MICROCOMPUTATIONAL SELECTIVITY ENHANCEMENT TO ACHIEVE SELECTIVE MULTI-GAS ANALYSIS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH EXTENDS THIS TECHNIQUE TO DEVELOP INSTRUMENTS THAT CAN IDENTIFY AND MEASURE CONTAMINANTS IN SPACECRAFT CABINS. THE PHASE I RESEARCH WILL DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF APPLYING PATTERN RECOGNITION TECHNIQUES TO SELECTIVELY IDENTIFY ONE OF EIGHT REPRESENTATIVE CONTAMINANTS USING MEASUREMENTS FROM AN ARRAY OF SEMICONDUCTOR SENSORS. IN PHASE 2 A SINGLE-CHIP SENSOR ARRAY WILL BE FABRICATED AND COUPLED WITH SOFTWARE CAPABLE OF IDENTIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT OF MIXTURES OF CONTAMINANTS IN SPACECRAFT CREW CABINS. SUCCESSFUL RESEARCH WILL RESULT IN AUTOMATED INSTRUMENTS THAT IDENTIFY AND SELECTIVELY MEASURE INORGANIC AND VOLATILE ORGANIC CONTAMINANTS.",

RETURNING A PATIENCT TO OPTIMUM FUNCTION REQUIRES A VARIETY OF MEASURES TO INCREASE STRENGTH, RANGE OF MOTION, ENDURANCE (BOTH MUSCULAR AND CARDIOVASCULAR), AND OVERALL FITNESS. CURRENT BIOMECHANIC LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT THE CIRCULAR PEDALLING MOTION OF A BICYCLE WILL PLACE SIGNIFICANT STRESS UPON THE HIP, KNEE, AND ANKLE JOINTS, AS WELL AS MUSCLES SURROUNDING THEM. THE DESIRABILITY OF CIRCULAR CRAKING MOTION, AS OPPOSED TO A LINEAR RECIPROCATING MOTION, FOR REHABILITATION HAS NOT BEENTHE OBJECTIVE OF PHASE I OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO DESIGN AND BUILD AN ADJUSTABLE, RECIPROCATING CYCLING SYSTEM FOR REHABILITATION AND EXERCISE OF DISABLED INDIVIDUALS AND TESTITS FEASIBILITY. THE CYCLE, USING HYDRAULIC CYLINDERS, WOULD FACILITATE THE CONTROL (AND PRESCRIPTION) OF VARIOUS PATTERNS AND RANGES OF MOTION AS WELL AS CORRESPONDING FORCES AND MOMENTS UPON THE BODY. BY ALLOWING VARIOUS CONFIGURATIONS OF THE SEAT AND ORIENTATION OF THE PEDALS, A WIDE VARIETY OF CONDITIONS FOR REHABILITATION ARE POSSIBLE. THE PUSH-PULL DOUBLE-ACTING CYLINDER WOULD ALLOW ONLY ONE EXTREMITY TO BE EXERCISED AT A TIME IF DESIRED. A VARIETY OF BIOMECHANICAL MEASUREMENTS WILL DOCUMENT THE FEASIBILITY OF THE SYSTEM FOR REHABILITATION. PHASE II WOULD INCLUDE DESIGN REFINEMENT AND OPTIMIZATION, PHYSIOLOGICAL AND EXTENSIVE BIOMECHANICAL DOCUMENTATION OF THE SYSTEM AS COMPARED TO EXISTING REHABILITATION CYCLES. ACLINICAL EVALUATION OF THE VAILIDITY OF THE SYSTEM FOR REHABILITATION WOULD BE CONDUCTED. IN ADDITION, PRELIMINARYPRODUCTION COSTS AND MARKETING RESEARCH WOULD BE INITIATED.",

THE MODULE IS VERY VERSATILE AND CAN BE USED AS A BUILDING BLOCK FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS SUCH AS: FOUR-QUADRANT BI-DIRECTIONAL DC-AC INVERSION, LINE VOLTAGE REGULATION, UNINTERRUPTIBLE POWER SUPPLIES, ACTIVE POWER FILTERING, DC ISOLATION, POWER FACTORCOMPENSATION, AND FOUR-QUADRANT BI-DIRECTIONAL VOLTAGE/FREQUENCY CONVERSION. FURTHERMORE, IN MANY CASES, USE OF THE MODULE CAN ELIMINATE HEAVY AND EXPENSIVE LOW-FREQUENCY TRANSFORMERS AND OTHER INDUCTIVE SYSTEM COMPONENTS. IN PARTICULAR, THIS NEW MODULE APPEARS WELL-SUITED AS A DC-TO-400HZ INVERTER. THE PRESENT PROTOTYPE USES CLAMP-DIODE SWITCHING, WHICH, DUE TO THE REVERSE REDOVERY CHARACTERISTICS OF DIODES, CAUSES CERTAIN PROBLEMS. THESE PROBLEMS INCLUDE EMI/RFI, HIGH SWITCHING STRESSES AND UNNECESSARILY HIGH SWITCHING LOSSES. TO REMEDY THESE SHORTCOMINGS, IT IS PROPOSED TO REPLACE THE PRESENT CLAMP-DIODE SWITCHING APPROACH WITH A QUASI-RESONAMT SWITCHING SCHEME. QUASI-RESONANT SWITCHING ALLOWS SWITCHING FREQUENCIES UP TO THE MEGA-HERTZ RANGE. ITOFFERS MANY ADVANTAGES, SUCH AS: LOW EMI/RFI, LOW SWITCHING STRESSES AND SWITCHING LOSSES, EXTREMELY HIGH POWER DENSITIES AND, THEREFORE, EXTREMELY LIGHTWEIGHT AND COMPACT POWER CONDITIONING MODULES.",

THE INCORPORATION OF ANTIBIOTICS AND THE SULFONAMIDES IN LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY FEEDS HAS RISEN STEADILY SINCE 1950, AS ANIMAL PRODUCTION HAS EXPANDED AND GROWN. THE CONCERN OVER THE ADDITION OF SUBTHERAPEUTIC DOSES OF ANTIMICROBIALS TO ANIMAL FEED IS GROWING BECAUSE OF THEIR POTENTIAL AS A HUMAN HEALTH HAZARD. CURRENT METHODS FOR ANALYSIS OF SULFONAMIDES ARE LABOR-INTENSIVE, TIME-CONSUMING, AND CAN REQUIRE EXTENSIVE SAMPLE CLEANUP. THEY ALSO DETECT SULFA RESIDUES AT OR NEAR THE TOLERENCE LEVEL OF 0.1 PPM. THE GOALS OF THIS RESEARCH WOULD BE: (1) PRODUCTION OF SENSITIVE ANTIBODIES WHICH COULD BE USED AS ANALYTICAL REAGENTS TO IMPROVE THE ASSAY TIME AND LIMIT OF DETECTABILITY OF SULFONAMIDES IN SAMPLES REQUIRING LITTLE OR NO CLEANUP PRIOR TO ANALYSIS, (2) SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTION OF STABILIZED CELL LINES WHICH SECRETE SENSITIVE ANTIBODIES WOULD ELIMINATE THE POTENTIAL VARIATION OBSERVED FROM BATCH TO BATCH OF POLYCLONAL ANTIBODY.

THIS EFFORT WILL INVESTIGATE A NUMBER OF PROMISING APPROACHES TO REJECTING CLUTTER IN INFRARED SEARCH AND TRACK SETS (IRSTS) TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS. THE ALGORITHMS PROPOSED FOR INVESTIGATION FALL INTO TWO BROAD CLASSES; THE FIRST ARE NONLINEAR SPATIAL FILTERS OF THE MEDIAL TYPE. HISTORICALLY, NONLINEAR FILTERS WHEN FOUND, OFFER SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE TO LINEAR FILTERS. THE SECOND ALGORITHM CLASS FALLS UNDER THE HEADING OF VELOCITY HYPOTHESIS TESTING (VHT). THIS APPROACH REMOVES STRONGLY CORRELATED BACKGROUND CLUTTER USING A SIMPLE LOW PASS SPATIAL FILTER. THE LARGELY UNCORRELATED HIGH SPATIAL FREQUENCY BACKGROUND REMAINS. THE RESIDUAL SCENES ARE THEN SHIFTED AND AVERAGED OVER MULTIPLE FRAMES FOR ALL POSSIBLE TARGET VELOCITIES. THE AVERAGED FRAME SET OR SETS THAT ARE SHIFTED AT THE EMBEDDED TARGET VELOCITIES WILL HAVE TARGET SIGNAL ADDED CONSTRUCTIVELY AND THUS PROVIDE TARGET DETECTION.

THE AFA HAS TWO DISTINCT ADVANTAGES OVER EXISTING FLOW ANALYSIS TOOLS. FIRST, IT PROVIDES DATA FROM THOUSANDS OF SENSE POINTS; SECOND, IT DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH THE NATURAL LAMINAR FLOW (NLF) OF THE AIRFOILSURFACES. THE AFA ADDRESSES NASA REQUIREMENTS FOR AIRCRAFT FLIGHT TESTING TECHNIQUES AND INSTRUMENTATION (SUBTOPIC 03.07) FOR SENSING AND ANALYZING PRESSURE AND AIR FLOW CHARACTERISTICS. IN ADDITION, THE LIGHT WEIGHT OF THE SYSTEM SHOULD MAKE IT READILY ADAPTABLE TO A VARIETY OF IN-FLIGHT TESTS. GRAPHIC DISPLAY OF SOFTWARE WILL PROVIDE DATA VISUALIZATION THROUGH A NUMBER OF PLOTS, GRAPHS, AND ANIMATIONS; ALSO, DATA WILL BE STORED IN A FORMAT SUITABLE FOR USE BY A COMPUTER MODELING PROGRAM. THE SYSTEM DESCRIBED IN THIS PROPOSAL IS APPLICABLE TO SEVERAL OTHER SUBTOPICS IN THE NASA SBIR PROGRAM SOLICITATION. THESE SUBTOPICS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT NECESSARILY LIMITED TO, SUBTOPIC 02.01, COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS; SUBTOPIC 02.02, EXPERIMENTAL FLUID DYNAMICS; AND SUBTOPIC 02.10, ROTORCRAFT AERODYNAMICS AND DYNAMICS.",

THIS DOES NOT ALLOW FOR EFFICIENT REMOVAL OF THE TOTAL RESOURCE UNLESS DRILLING IS ACCOMPLISHED ON A CLOSE SPACING, WHICH ADVERSELY AFFECTS ECONOMICS. HORIZONTAL DRILLING FROM VERTICAL WELLS WILL PROVIDE THE BENEFIT OF ACCESS TO A LARGE PART OF THE COAL SEAM FROM A SINGLE WELL. IT WILL ALSO ALLOW ORIENTATION OF THE WELL TO ACHIEVE MAXIMUM GAS PRODUCTION. WITH THE EXISTING NATURAL FRACTURES IN COAL (CLEATS), HYDRAULIC FRACTURING FROM VERTICAL WELLS PROPAGATES PARALLEL TO THE PRIMARY FACE CLEATS. HORIZONTAL WELLS CAN BE ORIENTED PERPENDICULAR TO THE FACE CLEATS, LEADING TO MAXIMUM BENEFITFROM EXISTING FRACTURES. THE RESEARCH IN THIS PROJECT WILL ANSWER QUESTIONS REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF THIS DRILLING TECHNOLOGY TO CBM AND OTHER FRACTURED RESERVOIR PRODUCTION, INCLUDING THE TYPES OF DRILLING MUDS TO MAXIMIZE CBM PRODUCTION, THE TYPES OF DEWATERING TECHNIQUES TO BE USED, AND WHETHER THE ECONOMICS WILL JUSTIFY THE COST. THE RESEARCH WILL BE CARRIED OUT AT THE BIG RUN FIELD, WETZEL COUNTY, WV, BY REVITALIZING THIS FIELD, WHICH HAS PRODUCED OVER 2 BCF OF GAS FROM COALBEDS AT A DEPTH OF LESS THAN 1000 FEET. THE EXISTING WELLS HAVE DECLINED TO THE POINT WHERE THEY AVERAGE LESS THAN 1 MCFD PER WELL. THE RESULTS CAN ALSO BE TRANSPOSED TO OTHER SITES WHERE CBM PRODUCTION IS DECLINING, OR TO TOTALLY NEW SITES.",

THE VELOCITY OF SEISMIC WAVES IS MUCH FASTER IN FROZEN GROUND THAN UNFROZEN GROUND. WAVE VELOCITIES ALSO CAN BE USED TO PREDICT MODULI OR \"STIFFNESS\". THE SASW METHOD HAS ALREADY BEEN USED TO PREDICT THE SHEAR WAVE VELOCITY AND THICKNESS PROFILES FOR PAVEMENTS, LIQUEFACTION INVESTIGATIONS OF SOIL SITES, EARTH DAMS, CONCRETE DAMS, AND FILLS. THE METHOD IS BASED ON ELASTIC WAVE PROPAGATION THEORY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS METHODS FOR EVALUATING DISPERSION CURVES FOR SURFACE WAVES. ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING ASPECTS OF THE METHOD IS ITS CAPABILITY TO DETECT LOW VELOCITY LAYERS UNDERLYING HIGHER VELOCITY LAYERS WITH MEASUREMENTS MADE ON THE GROUND SURFACE. THIS CAPABILITY OF THE SASW METHOD OVERCOMES THE TRADITIONAL LIMITATION ON THE USE OF THE SEISMIC REFRACTION METHOD. THUS, THE SASW METHOD SHOWS STRONG POTENTIAL FOR LOCATING FROZEN AND UNFROZEN GROUND LAYERS, EVEN WHEN THE GROUND SURFACE IS FROZEN AND THE UNDERLYING SOILS ARE THAWED. RESEARCH WILL BE PERFORMED AT TWO SITES IN ALASKA WITH VARYING FROZEN AND UNFROZEN GROUND CONDITIONSTO DEVELOP MEASUREMENT AND ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR USING THESASW METHOD AT ARCTIC SITES. AS THE RESEARCH PROGRESSES, THE SASW METHODS CAPABILITIES FOR DETECTING OTHER SUBSURFACE ARCTIC CONDITIONS SUCH AS FROZEN ROADS, MASSIVE ICE LENSES, AND LATERAL PROPAGATION OF PERMAFROST WILL BE RESEARCHED. THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF FROZEN GROUND CONDITIONS TO ENGINEERS, CONTRACTORS AND THE PUBLIC ARE TREMENDOUS FOR IMPROVED PERFORMANCE AND ECONOMY OF CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF ROADS, BUILDINGS, RUNWAYS, AND PIPELINE FACILITIES.",

THESE CONDITIONS ARE PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF ATHEROSCLEROTICLESIONS WHICH THE BLOOD VESSELS SUPPLYING THE HEART AND BRAIN. CONSIDERABLE EVIDENCE HAS NOW ACCUMULATED WHICH SUGGEST THAT PLATELET-DERIVED GROWTH FACTOR (PDGF) STIMULATES THE GROWTH OF THE CELLS WHICH FORM THESE LESIONS. LOCALIZED HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF PDGF ARE THOUGHT TO ARISE AT THE LESIONS DUE TO ITS RELEASE FROM DAMAGED ENDOTHELIUM AND ADHERING PLATELETS AT THE LESION SITE. PDGFEXERTS ITS MITOGENIC EFFECT ON CELLS THROUGH A SPECIFIC PLASMA MEMBRANE PDGF RECEPTOR PROTEIN-TYROSINE KINASE. THE ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT IS TO FIND SPECIFIC INHIBITORS OF PDGF RECEPTOR KINASE ACTIVITY FOR EVALUATION AS THERAPEUTIC DRUGS IN THE TREATMENT OF ATHEROSCLEROSIS. IN ORDER TO DO THIS, PHASE I OF THE PROJECT WILL PURIFY THE HUMAN PDGF-RECEPTOR AND DEVELOP AN ASSAY FOR PDGF-DEPENDENT, PDGF RECEPTOR PROTEIN-TYROSINE KINASE ACTIVITY, WHICH IS CAPABLE OF BEING AUTOMATED SO THATLARGE NUMBERS OF POTENTIAL INHIBITOR COMPOUNDS CAN BE SCREENED. THE POTENTIAL IMPORTANCE OF FINDING A DRUG WHICH INHIBITS PDGF ACTION IS UNDERLINED BY THE FACT THAT ANNUALLYIN THE USA ALONE ABOUT 765,000 PEOPLE DIE OF HEART DISEASE, AND 154,000 OF CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES.",

FOUR MECHANISMS COULD ACCOUNT FOR THIS ACTIVATION: I) A POINT MUTATION AT SEVERAL SITES IN THE AMINO TERMINAL HALF OF THE GENOME; II) A SPECIFIC MUTATION AT THE REGULATORY SITE TYR 527; III) A DECREASE IN THE AMOUNT OR SPECIFIC ACTIVITY IN THE SRC TYR 527 SPECIFIC KINASE; OR IV) AN INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OR SPECIFIC ACTIVITY OF A PHOSPHOTYROSYL PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE SPECIFIC FOR THE SRC TYR 527 SITE. IN PHASE I WE PROPOSE TO CONFIRM THE ACTIVATION OF P60(C-SRC) PROTEIN TYROSINE KINASE ACTIVITY IN HUMAN COLON CARCINOMA CELL LINES BY AUTOPHOSPHORYLATION OF THE IMMUNOPRECIPITATED PROTEIN AND BY DIRECT ASSAY OF THE KINASEACTIVITY IN CELL EXTRACTS, USING EXOGENOUS SUBSTRATES. PHASE I WILL CONCENTRATE ON IDENTIFYING WHICH OF THE ABOVE MECHANISMS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR P60(C-SRC) ACTIVATION IN HUMANTUMOR CELL LINES. IN PHASE II WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP DIAGNOSTIC REAGENTS FOR EITHER THE ENZYMES WHICH MODULATE P60(C-SRC), OR FOR THE ACTIVATED FORM OF P60(C-SRC) ITSELF. ADDITIONALLY, ASSAYS WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR THERAPEUTIC REAGENTS WHICH INHIBIT P60(C-SRC) ACTIVATION IN COLON CANCERS.",

RESEARCHERS HAVE EMPHASIZED IMPROVEMENT OF THIN FILM OPTICAL COATINGS BY TRYING TO ALTER THEIR MICROSTRUCTURE WITH VARIOUS ION-ASSISTED DEPOSITION PROCESSES. ONE PROCESS PROMISING IMPROVEMENT IS ION PLATING DEPOSITION. IN CONTRAST TO MOST OF THE ION ASSISTED DEPOSITION PROCESSES, THE PROPOSED ION PLATING TECHNIQUE EMPLOYS A LOW VOLTAGE, HIGH CURRENT PLASMA ARC BURNING INTO THE EVAPORATION SOURCE - A MODIFIED ELECTRON BEAM GUN. THEREFORE, THESE HIGH DEPOSITION RATES LEND USE TO LARGE SCALE COATINGS OF EITHER LARGE OPTICS(MIRRORS) OR OF LARGE BATCHES OF SMALL OPTICS. ION PLATED OXIDE FILMS SHOW BULK-LIKE REFRACTIVE INDICES WITH LONG-TERM STABILITY OF OVER 5 YEARS, AND NO SPECTRAL SHIFTS WITH HUMIDITY OR TEMPERATURE CYCLING. THESE IMPROVED PROPERTIES CAN BE EXPLAINED IN PART BY THE ELECTRON MICROSCOPIC OBSERVATION OF A MUCH DENSER, BULK-LIKE MICROSTRUCTURE, AS OPPOSED TO THE TYPICAL COLUMNAR MICROSTRUCTURE OF CONVENTIONAL COATINGS.

THIS DEGRADATION IS CAUSED BY THE INABILITY OF NORMALIZATION ALGORITHMS IN CURRENT OPERATIONAL SONAR SYSTEMS TO SIMULTANEOUSLY ACHIEVE NEARLY OPTIMAL NORMALIZATION ROBUSTNESS AND DETECTION SENSITIVITY. THIS DEGRADATION IS AN INHERENT FEATURE OF THE NORMALIZATION ALGORITHM STRUCTURES EXISTENT IN CURRENT OPERATIONAL SONAR SYSTEMS. FURTHERMORE, THIS DEGRADATION IS STEADILY WORSENING IN OPERATIONAL SONAR SYSTEMS BECAUSE OF THE RESPONSE OF THE SONAR SYSTEM DESIGNER TO THE CONTINUOUSLY QUIETENING THREAT. THIS RESPONSE IS TO BUILD SONARS WITH INCREASED ARRAY GAIN, WHICH THEREFORE \"SEE\" MORE INTERFERING TARGETS. IN MANY SCENARIOS, THE DETECTION PERFORMANCE INCREASE PROVIDED BY THE INCREASED ARRAY GAIN IS LARGELY OFFSET BY THE DEGRADATION CAUSED BY POOR NORMALIZER PERFORMANCE. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE PHASE I EFFORT IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE NEW NORMALIZATION ALGORITHMS CAN PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT DETECTION PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS FOR SONAR TIME-BEARING DISPLAY APPLICATIONS ON A VARIETY OF OPERATIONALLY REALISTIC NAVY SUPPLIED AND CONTRACTOR GENERATED REAL AND SIMULATED TEST DATA CASES. TEST CANDIDATES WILL BE CHOSEN FROM THE FAMILIES OF CENSORED MEAN-LEVEL DETECTOR (CMLD) AND SPLIT-AVERAGE-EXCLUDE-AVERAGE NORMALIZERS BECAUSE OF THEIR EXTENSIVELY PROVEN ROBUST DETECTION PERFORMANCE IN SPECTRAGRAM AND RADAR DISPLAY APPLICATIONS.",

BY MEASURING THE DIFFERENTIAL DELAYS IN EACH SATELLITE'S TRANSMISSIONS ON ITS TWO FREQUENCY CHANNELS, L(1) AND L(2), CONTINUOUS MEASURES OF THE TOTAL ELECTRON CONTENT (TEC) OF THE IONOSPHERE ALONG THE LINES OF SIGHT TO THE SATELLITES MAY BE MADE. THE DEVELOPMENT CONTEMPLATES PERFORMING THE MEASUREMENTS ON EACH OF THE CHANNELS WITHOUT REQUIRING KNOWLEDGE OF THE PRECISION (P) CODE, THEREBY RELIEVING PROBLEMS OF POTENTIAL UNAVAILABILITY OF THAT CODE. THE PROJECT BEGINS WITH A DESIGN FOR SUCH A RECEIVER WHICH GENERATES ONLY REPLICA C/A (CLEAR/ACCESS) CODES BUT WHICH ALSO TRACKS P-CODES DIFFERENTIALLY. OPERATION OF SUCH A RECEIVER ESTABLISHES FEASIBILITY, BUT THE DESIGN REQUIRES REFINEMENTS TO OVERCOME ACCURACY LIMITATIONS IMPOSED BY ANTENNA PROPERTIES, SIGNAL MULTIPATH AND PHASE SHIFT CONTROL WITHIN THE RECEIVER'S CHANNELS. REFINEMENTS TO THE DESIGN INVOLVING THE TIMING OF DATA SAMPLES ARE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE PERFORMANCE GAINS IN WIDER TRACKING BANDWIDTHS AND IN THE ABILITY TO DISCRIMINATE SIGNAL AMPLITUDE VARIATIONS DUE TO SCINTILLATION EFFECTS WITH THE IONOSPHERE.",

THE MCCS WILL EMPLOY TEN, 1024 BY 1024 PIXEL CCDS ARRANGED IN A STAGGERED FORMAT TO PROVIDE A RESOLUTION WIDTH OF OVER ONE MILLION DETECTOR PIXELS. THE MCCS WILL INCREASE TEN-FOLD THE IMAGING FIELD OF VIEW OVER A CONVENTIONAL TDI CAMERA SYSTEM THAT EMPLOYS A SINGLE 1024 BY 1024 PIXEL CCD. THE MCCS PROVIDES A MORE PRACTICAL SOLUTION TO THE TDI RESOLUTION PROBLEM THAN CAMERA SYSTEMS RELYING ON A SINGLE LARGE FORMAT (2048 BY 2048) CCD. THE MCCS MAKES USE OF SMALLER FORMAT, COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE CCDS WHICH ARE PRODUCED IN HIGHER YIELDS THAN LARGE FORMAT CCDS. BECAUSE IT IS BASED ON AN EXPANDABLE NUMBER OF CCDS, THE MCCS CAN BEALTERED TO SATISFY THE DESIRED DEGREE OF RESOLUTION. THE READOUT OF SEVERAL CCDS IN PARALLEL RESULTS IN A HIGHER READOUT RATE PER SCAN LINE, EVEN IN SLOW-SCAN CAMERAS. IN PHASE I, A TWO-CCD TDI CAMERA SYSTEM WILL BE CONSTRUCTED TO EVALUATE THE MCCS CONCEPT AND TO DETERMINE THE TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR IMPLEMENTING A TEN-CCD CAMERA SYSTEM. THE ACCURACY OF OPTICAL ALIGNMENT, ABILITY TO REGISTER THE IMAGES FROM THE TWO CCDS, AND THE ABILITY TO PRECISELY CONTROL VERTICAL SHIFTING FOR TDI OPERATION WILL BE MEASURED.",

WEAK LINKS IN THE SINGLE LAYERS OR BULK FORMS OF THE OXIDE SUPERCONDUCTOR ARE MADE IN TWO STEPS. FIRST, A PHYSICAL CONSTRICTION IS MADE TO ATTAIN A CRITICAL CURRENT OF A FEW MILLIAMPERES.

THE NON-IMAGING OPTICAL CONCENTRATOR HAS NO MOVING PARTS, IS LIGHTWEIGHT AND RADIATION HARD, AND CAN RESOLVE THE DIRECTION OF INCIDENT PHOTONS (VISIBLE AND IR). IN PHASE I OF THIS PROGRAM, POC WILL GATHER TOGETHER A LARGE NUMBER OF THESE SENSORS ATTACHED TO OPTICAL FIBERS IN ORDER TO MAKE A PROTOTYPE MODELED AFTER THE COMPOUND EYE (OMMATIDIUM) OF AN INSECT. THIS OPTICAL SYSTEM TOGETHER WITH SIGNAL PROCESSING WILL THEN BE DESIGNED TO DETECT AND DETERMINE THE POSITION OF LIGHT SOURCES RELATIVE TO THE SENSOR. THE PHASE I PROGRAM WILL CONSIST OF POC PROVIDING A FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION OF AN OPTICAL SENSOR BUILT AROUND THIS BASE TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN DETECT AND DETERMINE THE POSITION AND SEPARATION OF POINT LIGHT SOURCES RELATIVE TO THE SENSOR. A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT MODEL WILL BE FABRICATED AND TESTED. A REPORT DEFINING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS SENSOR FOR USE ABOARD FUTURE AIR FORCE AIRCRAFT WILL CONCLUDE THIS PHASE, IN PHASE II IT IS PROJECTED THAT THE PROTOTYPE MODEL WILL BE REFINED AND THE SOLID ANGLE OF COVERAGE WILL BE EXPANDED TO 2 PI STERADIANS. IT IS ALSO EXPECTED THAT IN THIS OPTICAL CONFIGURATION REDUNDANCY WILL BE PROVIDED IN THAT ADJUNCT OPTICAL FIBER/DETECTOR UNITS WILL PROVIDE OVERLAPPING COVERAGE WHEN DETECTING AND LOCATING MULTIPLE LIGHT SOURCES.",

THE DIAGNOSTIC IS BASED UPON THE LASER-INDUCED FLUORESCENCE FROM MOLECULAR OXYGEN WHICH IS EXCITED WHEN 193 NM LIGHT FROM AN ARF EXCIMER LASER PROPAGATES THROUGH THE AIR. PARTIAL PREDISSOCIATION GIVES THE EXCITED MOLECULAR OXYGEN A VERY SHORT LIFETIME AND THEREFORE RENDERS IT IMMUNE TO ELECTRONIC QUENCHING. THE INTENSITY OF THE OBSERVED LASER-INDUCED FLUORESCENCE, THEREFORE, IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE LOCAL NUMBER DENSITY OF THE VOLUME BEING PROBED. DETECTING THIS FLUORESCENCE WITH A TWO-DIMENSIONAL DIODE ARRAY AS THE LASERBEAM SCANS ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE TEST OBJECT MAPS OUT THE TURBULENCE IN TWO DIMENSIONS. THREE DIMENSIONAL MAPPINGRESULTS FROM REPEATING THE LASER SCANS AT A NUMBER OF DISTANCES ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE TEST OBJECT. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DETERMINE QUANTITATIVELY THE FLUORESCENCE YIELD FROM THE EXCITATION, AND THEREBY, THEPOTENTIAL SENSITIVITY OF SUCH A DIAGNOSTIC.

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE U.S. AIR FORCE OPERATES JET ENGINE TEST CELLS AND WASTE INCINERATORS THAT MAY EMIT SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF NITROGEN OXIDES. COMBUSTION MODIFICATIONS THAT ARE COMMONLY USED TO CONTROL NO(X) EMISSIONS FROM BOILERS ARE NOT PRACTICAL FOR TEST ENGINES OR INCINERATORS BECAUSE HIGH TEMPERATURES AND RAPID FUEL-AIR MIXING ARE REQUIRED TO MAXIMIZE ENGINE PERFORMANCE AND DESTRUCTION OF HAZARDOUS WASTES. MOST POST-COMBUSTION NO(X) CONTROL TECHNIQUES, HOWEVER, TEND TO BE VERY EXPENSIVE TO BUILD AND OPERATE. THE PSI TECHNOLOGY COMPANY (PSIT) HAS CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF BOTH COMBUSTION AND POST-COMBUSTION NO(X)-RELATED TECHNOLOGIES. HEREIN, WE PROPOSE A TECHNICAL AND ECONIMIC FEASIBILITY STUDY TO ASSESS A TECHNOLOGY KNOWN AS \"REBURNING\", WHEREBY NO(X) IS DESTROYED BY HYDROCARBON RADICALS PRODUCED IN A SECONDARY FLAME ZONE DECOUPLED FROM THE EMISSION SOURCE. THE POTENTIAL ADVANTAGES OF REBURNING INCLUDE LOW CAPITAL INVESTMENT, 50 TO 80 PERCENT NO(X) REDUCTION, HEAT RECOVERY FROM THE PROCESS, AND DESTRUCTION OF HYDROCARBONS, SOOT, OR DIOXIN PRECURSORS ESCAPING THE PRIMARY COMBUSTION ZONE. OUR APPROACH IS TO PERFORM TWO SITE-SPECIFIC REBURNING SYSTEM DESIGNS, SUPPORTED BY LIMITED PROOF-OF-CONCEPT TESTS IN AN EXISTING PSIT COMBUSTION FACILITY IN ORDER TO DUPLICATE THE FLUE GAS TEMPERATURE, NO(X), AND O(2) CONCENTRATIONS IN THE INCINERATOR/JET ENGINE EXHAUST. THE RESULTS OF THIS ANALYSIS WOULD LEAD TO PROCESS OPTIMIZATION TESTS AND DETAILED SYSTEM DESIGNS IN PHASE II.",

BY USING A MORE REACTIVE ADDITIVE WE ANTICIPATE THAT A SIMPLER AND THEREFORE LONGER LIVED, LESS EXPENSIVE CATALYST CAN BE USED TO PROVIDE A PREFERRED PROCESS. OUR PROPOSED PHASE I PROJECT CONSISTS OF FIXED BED ADDITIVE/CATALYST SCREENING TESTS AND SUBSEQUENT ENTRAINED FLOW TESTS OF PROMISING CANDIDATE COMBINATIONS.

THE APPROACH HAS PROVED SUPERIOR TO THAT OF MAGNETRONS, GIVING BETTER PROCESS CONTROL AND FILM QUALITY, AND THE POSSIBILITY FOR HIGHER DEPOSITION RATE. A NOVEL APPROACH FOR THE DEPOSITION OF HIGH TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTING (HTS) THIN FILMS INVOLVES PRODUCING ONE OR MULTIPLE PLASMA BEAMS AND TRANSPORTING THE PLASMA ALONG A WEAK GUIDE MAGNETIC FIELD TO SEPARATE TARGETSOF Y, BA AND CU LOCATED AT A DISTANCE UP TO 1 M FROM THE PLASMA SOURCE. THE CURRENT TO THE TARGET IS CONTROLLED BY ADJUSTING THE PLASMA POWER WHILE THE SPUTTER RATE FROM EACH TARGET IS CONTROLLED INDIVIDUALLY THROUGH ADJUSTING THE TARGET VOLTAGE. THE PROCEDURE OFFERS A NUMBER OF KEY ADVANTAGES INCLUDING CONTROL OVER THE STOICHIOMETRY OF THE FILMS. THE SEPARATION OF PLASMA PRODUCTION AND SPUTTER DEPOSITION GIVES PROCESS STABILITY BY PREVENTING OXIDATION OF THE TARGETS. THIS PROJECT WILL DEMONSTRATE THIS UNIQUE PLASMA SPUTTERING ARRANGEMENT FOR PRODUCING HTS FILMS, WITH SPECIAL CONTROL OVER THE STOICHIOMETRY OF THE FILMS AND THE RATE OF FILM PRODUCTION. SUPERCONDUCTING THIN FILMS WILL BE DEPOSITED ON STRONTIUM TITANATE SUBSTRATES AND THEIR SUPERCONDUCTING PROPERTIES WILL BE MEASURED.",

THE HEATING OF COMPOSITE COMPONENTS FOR CURE OR CONSOLIDATION USING ELECTRIC RESISTANCE HEATING OF THE CARBON FIBER WITHIN THE LAYUP IS POTENTIALLY MORE EFFICIENT THAN CURRENT HEATING METHODS BECAUSE CARBON DIBER IS WELL SUITED FOR RESISTIVE HEATING AND THE HEAT CAN BE CONFINED TO THE PART ONLY RATHER THAN TO THE PART, THE TOOL, AND THE PRESS OR AUTOCLAVE.

THE RESEARCH IS EXPECTED TO LEAD TO DEVELOPMENT OF AN IMAGING SYSTEM FOR DIELECTRIC EVALUATION AND FOR MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS OF HUMAN ANATOMY. WHILE THERE EXIST MANY IMAGING TECHNIQUES, DIRECT IMAGING OF DIELECTRIC PROFILES IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE. THE MICROWAVE DOSE FOR IMAGING OFHUMAN BODY IS EXPECTED TO BE IN THE ORDER OF MICROWATT PER GRAM TO TENS OF MICROWATT PER GRAM, WHICH IS TWO TO THREE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE BELOW THE SAFETY LEVEL. THE IMAGE WILL PROVIDE A DIELECTRIC PROFILE OF THE TARGET WITH A RESOLUTIONUP TO ABOUT 3 MM IN EACH OF THE THREE DIMENSIONS. DUE TO THE SENSITIVITY OF DIELECTRIC PERMITTIVITY WITH RESPECT TO VARIOUS BIOLOGICAL TISSUES, IT WILL, COMPARING TO EXISTING IMAGING DEVICES, PROVIDE GREATER CONTRAST BETWEEN TUMOR AND NORMAL TISSUES, AND BE APPLICABLE FOR LOCALIZATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF TUMORS AND FOR PLANNING OF TUMOR TREATMENT. THIS IMAGING TECHNIQUE MAY ALSO BE UTILIZED IN NON-INVASIVE EVALUATION OF OTHER MATERIALS WHERE DIELECTRIC PROFILE IS NEEDED, OR IN THE MAPPING OF OTHER PHYSICAL PARAMETERS TO WHICH DIELECTRIC PERMITTIVITY IS SENSITIVE, SUCH AS TEMPERATURE OR PRESSURE.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         AN ATTRACTIVE POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVE TO CURRENT HAZARDOUS ORGANICS INCINERATORS IS THE CATALYTICALLY STABILIZED THER- MAL (CST) COMBUSTOR. EXPLORED IN THE LATE 1970'S (WITH EPA FUNDING) AS A COMBUSTION SYSTEM TO ELIMINATE GAS TURBINE NOXEMISSIONS, THE CST COMBUSTOR USES CATALYTIC SURFACE REAC- TIONS TO STABILIZE GAS PHASE COMBUSTION, COMBINING HIGH GAS PHASE REACTION RATES WITH THE LEAN BURN CAPABILITY OF CATA- LYSTS. EPA-FUNDED TEST RESULTS USING CONVENTIONAL FUELS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE PLUG FLOW CST COMBUSTOR, COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL (BACKMIXED) COMBUSTORS, IS CAPABLE OF OPERATING AT HIGHER EFFICIENCY, WITH GREATER STABILITY, AT LEANER FUEL/AIR MIXTURES AND WITH UNSURPASSED CO,NOX, SOOT AND UNBURNED HYDROCARBON EMISSIONS. RECENT WORK AT YALE UNIVERSITY HAS SHOWN THAT THE CST COMBUSTOR CANACHIEVE HIGH DESTRUCTION LEVELS OF A METHYL CHLORIDE WITH VERY LOW RESIDENCE TIME AND HIGH FLAME STABILITY. THE IMPLICATIONS FOR INCINERATION INCLUDE LOWER CAPITAL COSTS, LOWER OPERATING COSTS, INCREASED SAFETY OF OPERATION, PLUS A LOWERMINIMUM ECONOMIC SIZE. COMPARED TO CURRENT BACKMIXED GAS PHASE INCINERATORS, THE INVESTIGATORS PRELIMINARY RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE PLUG FLOW CST COMBUSTOR WILL EXHIBIT LOWER RESIDENCE TIME, HIGHER FLAME STABILITY, HIGHER DESTRUCTION EFFECTIVENESS, LOWER OPERATING COSTS, AND MUCH LOWER CAPITAL COSTS. GASEOUS AND LIQUID WASTES CAN BE BURNED DIRECTLY AND PCI BELIEVERS SOLIDWASTE BURNING CST SYSTEMS WILL BE FEASIBLE. COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS INCLUDE CURRENT THERMAL DESTRUCTION CHALLENGES PLUS NEW MARKETS ARISING FROM ADVANTAGEOUS ECONOMICS, INCLUDING THE INCREASED ON-SITE DESTRUCTION.",

THE APPROACH INVOLVES GROWTH OF CELLS ON A MAGNETICALLY SENSITIZED MICROCARRIER BEAD SO THAT MUCH HIGHER MICROCARRIER DENSITY WHICH IN TURN MEANS HIGHER CELL DENSITY (>1.0 X 10(7) /ML) CAN BE USED IN A BIOREACTOR. OTHER ADVANTAGES OF THIS APPROACH INCLUDE COMPATIBILITY WITH EXISTING CULTURE HARDWARE AND PROCEDURES,EASE OF SCALE-UP, SIMPLIFIED CONTROL, AND NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO OPTIMIZE CELLULAR METABOLISM AND PRODUCT YIELD. PHASE I RESEARCH OBJECTIVE IS TO DEVELOP THIS MAGNETICALLY SENSITIZED MICROCARRIERS AND DEMONSTRATE ITS POTENTIAL UTILITY FOR CELL CULTURE OF ANCHORAGE DEPENDENT CELLS. THISRESEARCH WILL ALSO STUDY VARIOUS COATING MATERIALS AND THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH CELL ATTACHMENT AND DETACHMENT. IN THE ABSENCE OF OXYGEN LIMITATION OR MEDIUM EXHAUSTION, THE PHASE I RESEARCH WILL DEMONSTRATE THE MAXIMUM ACHIEVABLE CELL DENSITY IN A LABORATORY MAGNETICALLY STABILIZED BIOREACTOR SYSTEM. PHASE II RESEARCH WILL EXTEND AND SCALE UP THESE RESULTS TO COMMERCIALLY RELEVANT CELL CULTURE CONDITIONS.",

NEVERTHELESS, QUANTITATIVE DATA DESCRIBING THIS PHENOMENON ARE GENERALLY LACKING, AND QUESTIONS CONTINUOUSLY ARISE CONCERNING THE RELATIONSHIP AMONG DUST SIZE, CONCENTRATION LEVEL, FILTER PERFORMANCE, AND ENGINE WEAR. THIS UNCERTAINTY MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SPECIFY FILTRATION LEVELS THAT WILL ASSURE ADEQUATE AND COST-EFFECTIVE ENGINE PROTECTION. TO MINIMIZE ENGINE WEAR AND THE RISK OF PREMATURE ENGINE FAILURE, AIR FILTERS MUST PREVENT WEAR-CAUSING PARTICLES FROM ENTERING THE ENGINE. IN ADDITION, OIL FILTERS MUST REMOVE PARTICLES THAT PENETRATE THE INLET AS WELL AS PARTICLES THAT ARE GENERATING DURING ENGINE OPERATION. IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE CAUSE AND EFFECT RELATIONSHIPS, A LABORATORY PROGRAM IS PROPOSED TO MEASURE ENGINE WEAR AS A FUNCTION OF INTAKE AIR QUALITY USING RADIOACTIVE TRACER TECHNIQUES (RTT). THESE MEASUREMENTS WILL PROVIDE A BASIS FOR QUANTIFYING ENGINE WEAR AS A FUNCTION OF SPECIFIC DUST PARAMETERS, AND IN PARTICULAR, THE PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS THAT MUST BE REMOVED BY THE AIR AND OIL FILTERS WILL BE DETERMINED. BY CORRELATING DUST LEVELS TO FILTER PERFORMANCE, OIL AND AIR FILTER SPECIFICATION REQUIREMENTS CAN BE DEFINED. FURTHERMORE, BECAUSE ENGINES IN MILITARY VEHICLES OFTEN RUN HOTTER THAN NORMAL, THE INFLUENCE OF HIGH TEMPERATURE OPERATION WILL ALSO BE INVESTIGATED. THIS WILL MEASURE ABRASIVE WEAR DUE TO THE SYNERGISTIC IMPACT OF DUST INGESTION AND LUBRICATION DEGRADATION, WHICH IS LIKELY WHEN OPERATING AT HIGHER THAN NORMAL ENGINE TEMPERATURES. OVERALL, THIS EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM WILL DEVELOP A BODY OF KNOWLEDGE FROM WHICH MEANINGFUL CORRELATIONS AND DECISIONS CAN BE MADE CONCERNING ENGINE WEAR, DUST SIZE, AND FILTER PERFORMANCE.",

IN PHASE ONE OF THIS PROJECT, WE PROPOSE TO MEASURE TOTAL BODY WATER, INTRACELLULAR WATER AND EXTRACELLULAR WATER AS SEPARATE FLUID COMPARTMENTS BY ISOTOPIC MEANS IN PATIENTS WITH VARIOUS DISORDERS AND SIMULTANEOUSLY TO STUDY THE FREQUENCY-DEPENDENT IMPEDANCE CHARATERISTICS OF THESE INDIVIDUALS. THIS WILL ESTABLISH THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN FREQUENCY-DEPENDENT BIOELECTRIC IMPEDANCE AND THE PARTITION OF TOTAL BODY WATER INTO INTRACELLULAR AND EXTRACELLULAR COMPARTMENTS. WE WILL USE THE INFORMATION OBTAINED TO DEVELOP EQUATIONS PERMITTING BEDSIDE ESTIMATES OF THESE FLUID COMPARTMENTS FROM THE ANTHROPOMETRIC AND BIOELECTRIC DATA ONLY. IN PHASE TWO, WE WILL USE THE RELATIONSHIPS ESTABLISHED IN PHASE ONE TO CONDUCT A RANDOMIZED, PROSPECTIVE STUDY TO HELP MANAGE A GROUP OF PATIENTS, COMPARING RESULTS WITH A CONTROL GROUP, MANAGED BY STANDARD CLINICAL EVALUATION AND COMMONLY ACCEPTED METHODS. WE WILL EVALUATE THE OVERALL EFFICACY OF TREATMENT GUIDED BY THIS TYPE OF MONITORING, THEFREQUENCY OF ADVERSE CLINICAL EVENTS, AND THE COST OF CARE AGAINST THE SAME DETERMINANTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP. A SEPARATE PHASE TWO STUDY WILL EVALUATE THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN FREQUENCY-DEPENDENT BIOELECTRIC IMPEDANCE OF THE THORAX AND THE MAGNITUDE AND PARTITION OF LUNG WATER IN A GROUP OF CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS. SUCCESS IN THIS PROJECT WILL ENABLE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW, APPROVED MEDICAL DEVICE. WE HAVE A WORKING PROTOTYPE BIOIMPEDANCE DEVICE SUITABLE FOR CONDUCTING THE PHASE I STUDY NOW.",

BECAUSE FLUORESCENCE CT NEEDS ONLY MINIMALLY PREPARED, THICK SAMPLES, THE PROBABILITY OF CONTAMINATION SHOULD BE MUCH LOWER THAN FOR TECHNIQUES WHICH REQUIRE THE PHYSICAL SECTIONING OF THE SPECIMEN. FLUORESCENCE CT SHOULD RETAIN THE HIGH SENSITIVITY OF SYNCHROTRON RADIATION INDUCED X-RAY EMISSION. TO DETERMINE FEASIBILITY, THE BEAM OF THE X-RAY MICROPROBE (1) AT THE NATIONAL SYNCHROTRON LIGHT SOURCE WILL BE COLLIMATED TO A 10 MICRON SPOT. SAMPLES WILL BE TRANSLATED AND ROTATED (2) THROUGH THE BEAM USING THE PRESENTLY INSTALLED CT APPARATUS (3). IRON FLUORESCENCE X-RAYS WILL BE DETECTED FROM CULTURED MOUSE HEPATOCYTES. TRANSMITTED X-RADIATION WILL BE DETECTED SIMULTANEOUSLY SO THAT BOTH FLUORESCENCE AND ABSORPTION TOMOGRAMS CAN BE RECONSTRUCTED. IN ADDITION TO SHOWING WHETHER CONCENTRATIONS OF IRON CAN BE MAPPED WITHIN ORGANELLES, THISSTUDY WILL HELP TO CLARIFY THE ROLE OF IRON IN THE FREE RADICAL REACTIONS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO OXYGEN DEPENDENT TISSUEINJURY.

A SPECIFIC GOAL IS TO PROVIDE A MATERIAL THAT HAS A DENSITY OF APPROXIMATELY 50% OF THAT OF SUPERALLOYS AND A SIMILAR OPERATING TEMPERATURE. THE APPROACH IS TO UTILIZE ZIRCONIUM AS A SUBSTITUTIONALELEMENT FOR TITANIUM IN THE TI(3)AL HIGLY ORDERED HEXAGONAL CRYSTAL LATTICE STRUCTURE. THIS WILL HAVE THE EFFECT OF CREATING A MINOR EXPANSION AND \"DISORDERING\" OF THE LATTICE AND THUS, WILL CREATE MORE POSSIBILITIES FOR ADDITIONAL SLIP PLANS WITHIN THE CRYSTAL. FOR MAXIMUM DUCTILITY, PURITY OF ALL STARTING MATERIALS IS CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL AND VACUUM CASTING WILL AVOID CONTAMINATION FROM OXYGEN, HYGEN AND NITROGEN. CONTROLLED VARIATIONS IN THE ALUMINUM, TITANIUM, AND ZIRCONIUM CONTENT WILL BE USED IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE OPTIMUM DUCTILITY AND ELEVATED TEMPERATURE SPECIFIC MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THE ALLOY. COMPOSITIONS AS HIGH IN ZR AS 45ZR, 45TI, 10AL WILL BE FABRICATED AND TESTED. IN PHASE II, ACTIVITIES WILL INCLUDE (1) USE OF MORE DUCTILE TIZRAL ALLOY AS A COMPOSITE MATRIX, AND (2) A DEMONSTRATION OF ALLOY FABRICABILITY OF ACTUAL TACTICAL MISSILE STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS.",

THE LOCAL, BOTTOM-UP APPROACH TO VISION CANNOT DEAL WITH THE NOISE AND THE ON-GOING PRODUCTION OF NOVELTY IN REAL VISUAL SCENES, WHILE EXPERT SYSTEM APPROACHES ARE TOO BRITTLE AND SLOW TO DO REAL-TIME IMAGE PROCESSING. WE BELIEVE THE COMBINED NN/EXPERT SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE IN THIS PROPOSAL WILL OVERCOME MANY OF THE PROBLEMS WITH PREVIOUS APPROACHES. THE PROPOSED PROJECT HAS 2 PRIMARY GOALS: 1) TO CONSTRUCT A COMPUTER APPLICATION THAT COMBINES A NEURAL NETWORK (NN) COMPONENT AND AN EXPERT SYSTEM COMPONENT IN A WAY THAT ENHANCES THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH; 2) USE THE SYSTEM TO CREATE FASTER MORE FLEXIBLE SOLUTIONS TO EXPERT LEVEL PROBLEMS IN VISION.",

THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO ACCURATELY DEFINE A TBM SOURCE MODEL AND TO USE THIS MODEL TO DEFINE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A SEISMIC IMITATOR. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SEISMIC IMITATOR WILL BE DETERMINED BY ITS ABILITY TO MASK DETECTION AND PREVENT OR DISTURB A TBM LOCATION ATTEMPT. PHASE I IS DIVIDED INTO FOUR TASKS. TASK ONE DEVELOPS A SOFTWARE MODEL OF THE SEISMIC EMISSIONS FROM A TBM. THE MODEL WILL BE VALIDATED BY COMPARISON AND ACTUAL TBM FIELD DATA FROM PREVIOUS MEASUREMENTS. TASK TWO WILL INVESTIGATE CANDIDATE DEVICES WHICH COULD FUNCTION AS SEISMIC IMITATORS. TASK THREE STUDIES THE PROBLEM OF USING A SEISMIC IMITATOR TO MASK SIGNAL DETECTION.

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE PROPOSED PROGRAM INVLOLVES THE CONSTRUCTION OF A BREAD- BOARD 2.1 MICRON LIDAR AEROSOL PROFILER AND MEASUREMENTS OF AEROSOL BACKSCATTER. THE LIDAR WILL UTILIZE A NEW AND UNIQUE, ROOM TEMPERATURE, EYE-SAFE HOLMIUM LASER COMMERCIAL-LY SOLD BY SCHWARTZ ELECTRO-OPTICS (SEO). THIS EFFICIENT, SOLID STATE LASER IS BASED UPON A PROPRIETARY HOLMIUM: YSGG CRYSTAL DEVELOPED BY SEO AND CURRENTLY IS THE ONLY TWO MI- CRON LASER ON THE MARKET. PRIOR WORK AT LINCOLN LABORATORY BY SEO'S CONSULTANT DR. DENNIS KILLINGER AND SEO'S VICE PRESIDENT OF RESEARCH DR. PETER MOULTON SHOWED THE PROMISE OF A TWO MICRON LIDAR FOR THE PROPOSED APPLICATION USING A COBALT MAGNESIUM FLUORIDE LASER HAVING ONLY ONE TENTH OF THEOUTPUT POWER AVAILABLE FROM THE HOLMIUM LASER. ALSO COBALT MAGNESIUM FLUORIDE (A LASER PUMPED LASER) IS A MORE COM- PLEX LASER THAN HOLMIUM:YSGG. THE PROPOSED EFFORT WILL BE COMPLEMENTED BY DIODE-PUMPED HOLIUM LASER RESEARCH ON-GOING AT SEO UNDER AN AIR FORCE PHASE-I SBIR CONTRACT. THE PRO- POSED EFFORT WILL MAKE USE OF COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE SIGNAL PROCESSING EQUIPMENT FOR PROCESSING AEROSOL RETURNS AND WILLINCLUDE A PRELIMINARY DESIGN DEMONSTRATION OF UNATTENDED OPERATION",

AMPLIFICATION POWER WILL BE SUPPLIED BY A BATTERY PACK CONTAINED WITHIN THE VEHICLE. THE MAJOR ADVANTAGE OF THE RETRODIRECTIVE ARRAY IS THAT THE ANTENNA MAIN LOBE IS DIRECTED AT THE THREAT RECEIVER, WHICH ENHANCES JAMMING EFFICIENCY. THE FOCUS OF THIS EFFORT WILL BE TO DETERMINE THE ANTENNA PERFORMANCE, BATTERY POWER, SIGNAL PROCESSOR, AND REENTRY VEHICLE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS FOR AN EFFECTIVE JAMMER, BASED UPON THE THREAT RADAR SPECIFICATIONS, THE PERTINENT ENGAGEMENT SCENARIOS, AND THE WEIGHT AND SIZE CONSTRAINTS.

THIS CLASS OF CONSTELLATION HAS ALREADY BEEN SHOWN BY THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR TO BE CAPABLE OF PROVIDING CONTINUOUS SINGLE HEMISPHERIC, SINGLE GLOBAL, AND DOUBLE GLOBAL EARTH COVERAGE WITH THREE, FOUR, AND SIX SATELLITE ARRAYS RESPECTIVELY. EACH ARRAY REPRESENTS A DECREASE IN NUMBERS OF SATELLITES REQUIRED OVER ANY PREVIOUSLY KNOWN ARRAYS. THE PROPOSED EFFORT WOULD EXTEND EARLIER WORK INTO THE AREA OF TRIPLE AND QUADRUPLE COVERAGE WITH THE MINIMUM NUMBERS OF SATELLITES. THE OUTPUT OF THIS EFFORT WILL BE AS FOLLOWS: A) A DESCRIPTION OF THE DESIGN METHODOLOGY AND TECHNIQUES USED BY THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR. B) STATEMENTS OF THEOREMS AND COROLLARIES DEVELOPED FOR REDUNDANT CONTINUOUS COVERAGE ARRAYS. C) EPHEMERIDES, OR ORBITAL PARAMETERS, FOR OPTIMAL ARRAY CONFIGURATIONS, IN TABULAR FORM. D) LIMITING VALUES ON INPUT ORBITAL PARAMETERS. THIS WILL CONSIST OF CONTOURS OR LIMIT LINES OUTSIDE WHICH THE COVERAGE CRITERIA CANNOT BE MET.",

HOWEVER, IT SOON BECAME APPARENT THAT THE INFORMATION CONTYAINED IN THE SEISMIC RADAR DISPLAY, WHILE AN EFFECTIVE DEMONSTRATION VEHICLE FOR THE WORKSTATION, SHOULD ALSO BE EXTREMELY USEFUL TO AN ANALYST WHO REQUIRES NEAR-REAL-TIME, COMPREHENSIBLE ESTIMATES OF THE AZIMUTH, VELOCITY, AND AMPLITUDE OF THE INDIVIDUAL PHASES WHICH COMPRISE A SEISMIC EVENT.

GRADIENTS IN EXCESS OF 200 MEV/METER APPEAR FEASIBLE WITH ACCELERATOR STRUCTURE WEIGHTS OF LESS THAN 100 KG/GEV. HOWEVER, THE WEIGHT CORRESPONDING TO THE INDUCTION LINAC-BASED RELATIVISTIC KLYSTRON DRIVERS WOULD CURRENTLY EXCEED 10,000 KG/GEV.

IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE OUTLINE OUR PLANS TO BUILD A SOFTWARE PACKAGE FOR THE CONNECTION MACHINE CM-2 THAT WILL BRING THE POWER OF BOTH ADVANCES TO THE AID OF THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY WITHOUT FORCING THAT COMMUNITY TO BECOME EXPERT IN EITHER TECHNOLOGY. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP EFFICIENT MASSIVELY PARALLEL ALGORITHMS FOR THE ITERATIVE SOLUTION OF LARGE SPARSE LINEAR SYSTEMS OF EQUATIONS. WE WILL IMPLEMENT THESE ALGORITHMS IN A PACKAGE PCGPAK/CM EXPLICITLY DESIGNED AND OPTIMIZED FOR THE CONNECTION MACHINE. PCGPAK/CM WILL BE BASED ON OUR EXISTING PROPRIETARY PACKAGE PCGPAK(TM), THE PRECONDITIONED CONJUGATE GRADIENT PACKAGE OF SUBROUTINES FOR THE ITERATIVE SOLUTION OF LARGE, SPARSE NONSYMMETRIC SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS. PCGPAK IS A STATEOF-THE-ART SOLVER FOR UNIPROCESSOR ARCHITECTURES. IT WAS DESIGNED AND DEVELOPED BY SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING ASSOCIATES AND IS CURRENTLY MARKETED IN A HIGHLY-PORTABLE SEQUENTIAL PROCESSOR FORTRAN IMPLEMENTATION AND A HIGHLY VECTORIZED IMPLEMENTATION FOR THE CRAY-X/MP. PCGPAK IS CURRENTLY BEING USED AT MANY SITES INCLUDING SEVERAL OF THE NSF NATIONAL SUPERCOMPUTER CENTERS. WE BELIEVE THAT COMBINATION OF THE CM-2 AND PCGPAK/CM WILL BE SO MUCH FASTER THAN EXISTING SOLUTION TECHNOLOGIES SO AS TO COMPLETELY REVOLUTIONIZE THE STATE-OF-THE-ART IN COMPUTER SIMULATION.",

THE SETI PROJECT'S APPROACH FOR FINDING EXTRATERRESTRIAL ARTIFICIAL SIGNALS INCLUDES THE DETECTION OF WEAK NARROW BAND CW SIGNALS AMONG A LARGE NUMBER OF NOISY NARROWBAND CHANNELS. THE CW SIGNALS MAY DRIFT SLOWLY IN FREQUENCY, ANDTHE MANY CHOICES FOR FREQUENCY AND DRIFT MAKE COMPUTATION ANARDUOUS TASK AND CW DETECTION DIFFICULT. A KEY PART OF THE PROPOSED INNOVATION IS A MINIMAL PRECISION MATCHED FILTER PROCESSOR THAT IS IDEALLY SUITED FOR CUSTOM VLSI. THIS DEVICE WHEN USED AS THE CW DETECTOR COMPUTATION ENGINE ALLEVIATES THE COMPUTATION BOTTLENECK AND REPLACES ALL COMPETING ALTERNATIVES IN PERFORMANCE, SIZE AND COST.

THE TASK OF CONTROLLING A HELICOPTER, WHETHER IT IS HOVERING OR MOVING STRATEGICALLY IN FLIGHT IS PHYSICALLY TAXING. PILOTS ARE SUBJECTED TO EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE SEATING POSITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH CONTROLLING THE AIRCRAFT AND SEVERE HELICOPTER VIBRATIONS, CAUSING MANY PILOTS TO SUFFER FROM CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. THE INCIDENCE OF BACKACHE IN HELICOPTER PILOTS IS MORE SEVERE THAN IN PILOTS OF OTHER AIRCRAFT. THE HIGH INCIDENCE OF PILOT LOW BACK PAIN IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO DECREASED PERFORMANCE IN FLIGHT AND INCREASED HEALTH AND MEDICAL COSTS. THIS PROGRAM WILL IDENTIFY WAYS TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE AILMENT BY DETERMINING THE EFFECT OF CUSHIONS, DESIGNED WITH ERGONOMIC CONTOURS AND FABRICATED WITH VIBRATIONABSORBING MATERIALS, ON THE INCIDENCE OF LOW BACK PAIN. IN EVALUATING THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE CUSHIONS, VIBRATION TRANSMISSIBILITY AND LOW BACK COMFORT WILL BE THE TWO CRITERIA EXAMINED. IN THE PROPOSED PHASE I EFFORT, SIMULA WILL EXAMINE THE CONTRIBUTING PROBLEMS (I.E. POSTURE AND VIBRATION) AND THEN EXAMINE CUSHION CONCEPTS WITH THE POTENTIAL OF REDUCING THE EFFECTS OF THESE FACTORS. IN PHASE II, THE SELECTED CUSHION(S) WILL BE INSTALLED IN A HELICOPTER FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING ITS EFFECT ON LOW BACK PAIN.",

THE DEVELOPMENT OF A HOST, OPTIMIZED FOR HIGH ENERGY DIODE ARRAY PUMPING, WOULD GREATLY ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF PULSED DIODE-PUMPED SOLID-STATE LASERS, AS DEVELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATION COST COULD BE REDUCED BY AS MUCH AS A FACTOR OF TWO. SINCE ONE-MICRON NEODYMIUM LASERS ARE CURRENTLY THE OPTIMAL SOLID STATE SOURCE FOR NIR/VISIBLE 532-NM SOURCES, THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO DEVELOP LONG-LIFETIME, EASILY GROWABLE NEODYMIUM DOPED LASER MATERIALS FOR DIODE-PUMPED MULTI-JOULE LASERS.",

SPECTRAL SCIENCES, INC., PROPOSES TO DESIGN AND DEVELOP A SPECTROSCOPIC SENSOR FOR DETERMINING ORGANIC CONTAMINATION ON METAL SURFACES USING DETECTION OF OPTICAL EMISSION EXCITED BY A DIRECT CURRENT ELECTRIC DISCHARGE. THE PROPOSED SOCS INSTRUMENT WOULD CONTAIN AN INSERTABLE PROBE CONTAINING ELECTRODES AND FIBER OPTICS. A LOW-CURRENT DISCHARGE WOULD EXCITE THE ORGANIC MATERIALS, FORMING EXCITED CARBON ATOMS OR CARBON-CONTAINING RADICALS SUCH AS CH, WHICH EMIT LIGHT AT CHARACTERISTIC WAVELENGTHS.

        "abstract": "Abstract         SOLVENT EVAPORATION IN INDUSTRIAL DRYING CHAMBERS IS AN ENERGY INTENSIVE PROCESS THAT CURRENTLY UTILIZES ENERGY IN A VERY INEFFICIENT MANNER. THIS IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THESE DRYERS TYPICALLY OPERATE AT SOLVENT VAPOR CONCENTRATIONS ON THE ORDER OF 7% OF THE LOWER EXPLOSIVE LIMIT (LEL) IN ORDER TO ENSURE SAFE OPERATION. HOWEVER, IF A CONTINUOUS VAPOR CONCENTRATION MONITOR AND SAFETY INTERLOCKS WERE INSTALLED, THE SOLVENT CONCENTRATION COULD BE ALLOWED TO APPROACH 50% LEL. OPERATION AT HIGHER SOLVENTCONCENTRATIONS PRODUCES SIGNIFICANT, DIRECT ENERGY SAVINGS, AND IT RESULTS IN ADDITIONAL ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF IMPROVED DRYING EQUIPMENT PRODUCTIVITY AND REDUCTION OF SIZE AND COSTOF SOLVENT RECOVERY EQUIPMENT. THIS PROJECT ADDRESSES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SOLVENT ABSORPTION FIBER OPTIC EXPLOSIVE RANGE (SAFER) SENSOR WHICH WOULD PROVIDE A SENSITIVE, REAL-TIME MEASUREMENT OF THE SOLVENT CONCENTRATION IN INDUSTRIAL DRYERS AND WHICH COULD BE USED IN A PROCESS/SAFETY CONTROL SYSTEM. THE SAFER INSTRUMENT WOULD USE AN INNOVATIVE COMBINATION OF A PROVEN SENSOR HEAD AND NEW IR FIBER OPTIC TECHNOLOGIES. THIS COMBINATION PERMITS THE SAFER SENSOR TO PERFORM ITS MEASUREMENTS DIRECTLY IN THE CONTAMINATING ENVIRONMENT OF THE SOLVENT DRYER, THEREBY ELIMINATING THE PROBLEMS OF FOULING AND SAMPLE LINE DELAYS THAT HAVE RESTRICTED THE UTILITY OF CURRENTLY AVAILABLE SENSORS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMMERCIAL SENSOR FOR MONITORING AND CONTROLLING THE CONCENTRATION OF SOLVENT VAPORS IN INDUSTRIAL DRYING CHAMBERS. AS A FIRST STEP TOWARD THIS GOAL, A LABORATORY BREADBOARD WILL BE CONSTRUCTED IN PHASE I TO INVESTIGATE THE SENSITIVITY AND DYNAMIC RANGE OF THE TECHNICAL APPROACH, AS WELL AS THE EFFECTS OF SAMPLE TEMPERATURE. IN PHASE II, A BRASSBOARD SAFER INSTRUMENT WILL BE CONSTRUCTED AND TESTED IN AN INDUSTRIAL SOLVENT DRYING CHAMBER.",

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN HIGH POWER SURFACE-EMITTING, MULTIPLE QUANTUM WELL (MQW) LASERS INDICATE THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY MAY BE IDEALLY SUITED FOR THIS PURPOSE, AND WE INTEND TO EXPLORE THIS TECHNOLOGY IN GREAT DETAIL.

        "abstract": "Abstract         CREATION OF BURIED INSULATING LAYERS IN SILICON WAFERS BY HIGH DOSE OXYGEN IMPLANTATION (SIMOX) HAS GAINED SIGNIFICANT ATTENTION IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. THE SIMOX TECHNOLOGY IS POSITIONED TO BE A PRIME CONTENDER IN THE SILICON-ON-INSULATOR (SOI) ARENA MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT RELIABILITY/REPRODUCIBILITY OF THE ION IMPLANTATION TECHNOLOGY. ONE OBSTACLE TO BROADER USE OF THE SIMOX MATERIAL IS THE HIGH DENSITY OF DISLOCATIONS THAT APPEARS IN THE TOP-LAYERSILICON FOLLOWING THE HIGH TEMPERATURE ANNEALING REQUIRED FOR THE PROCESS. THE DISLOCATIONS ARE PARTICULARLY HARMFUL IN THE FABRICATION OF BIPOLAR DEVICES ON SIMOX MATERIAL. SPIRE CORPORATION HAS CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SIMOX TECHNOLOGY AND IS PERFORMING ONGOING RESEARCH IN THIS FIELD. SPIRE PROPOSES TO PERFORM SECONDARY ION IMPLANTATION OF SPECIES SUCH AS GE INTO THE SIMOX WAFERS FOR REMOVING THE DISLOCATIONS CREATED BY THE HIGH TEMPERATURE ANNEAL. PRELIMINARY RESULTS INDICATE THAT LOW DOSES OF GE IN THE TOP-LAYER-SILICON CAUSE AMORPHIZATION AND CREATED STRESS FIELDS. SUBSEQUENT ANNEALING OF THE WAFERS HAS RESULTED IN DISLOCATION DENSITIES BELOW THE DETECTABLE LIMIT OF THE X-TEM OR PLANE VIEW TEM METHODS.",

THE SENSOR WILL HAVE AN IMAGING RESOLUTION OF AT LEAST 400X400 PIXELS AND OPERATE A FRAME RATES TO 10,000 FRAMES/SECOND. THIS SENSOR WILL BE AN EXTENSION OF OUR CURRENT DEVELOPMENT OF A 256X256 PIXEL SENSOR THAT OPERATES AT FRAME RATES OF 2000 FRAMES/SECOND. OUR APPROACH WILL UTILIZE STANDARD READILY AVAILABLE CMOS BULK INTEGRATED CIRCUIT TECHNOLOGY SO PRODUCTS ARISING FROM THIS R&D; CAN BE FABRICATED RELIABLY AND ECONOMICALLY BY A NUMBER OF VENDORS. WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE FEASIBILITY OF FABRICATING PHOTOSENSOR ARRAYS USING STANDARD CMOS PROCESSES. ON-CHIP CIRCUITS PROVIDE SCANNING, LOGARITHMIC COMPRESSION (OPTICAL), AMPLIFICATION, SAMPLE-AND-HOLD, MULTIPLEXING, AND ROW AND COLUMN DECODING. WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED CUSTOM CMOS IMAGERS IN OUR LABORATORY THAT OPERATE AT FRAME RATES IN EXCESS OF 1000 FRAMES/SECOND. WE PRESENTLY HAVE A DESIGN IN FABRICATION THAT IS PROJECTED TO OPERATE IN EXCESS OF 2000 FRAMES/SECOND. THE DEVELOPMENT OF A 10,000 FRAME/SECOND VIDEO SENSOR IS A NATURAL EXTENSION OF THIS PRIOR WORK AND LEADS DIRECTLY TO AN INEXPENSIVE PRODUCT WITH WIDE APPLICABILITY IN COMMERCIAL, ACADEMIC, AND MILITARY MARKETS.",

THERE IS A DEVELOPING LITERATURE THAT THE APOLIPOPROTEINS A-1 AND B ARE BETTER MEASURES OF RISK THAN HDL AND LDL CHOLESTEROL WHICH CONTAIN THESE PROTEINS. DEVELOPMENT OF APOLIPOPROTEIN ASSAYS USING MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES WILL PROVIDE BETTER DIAGNOSIS OF RISK THAN THE LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL LEVELS. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO DEVELOP, PRODUCE AND MARKET SUCH AN ASSAY. A MAJOR PROBLEM IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE ASSAYS LIES IN THE LACK OF STABLE CONTROLS AND STANDARDS. THEREFORE, THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS PHASE I PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP STABLE STANDARDS AND CONTROLS SUITABLE FOR USE IN APOLIPOPROTEIN ASSAYS USING STABLE SOLID PHASE CORES WHICH SIMULATE THE SIZE OF LIPOPROTEINS AND WHICH CONTAIN ON THEIR SURFACE STABLE FRAGMENTS OF APOLIPOPROTEINS CONTAININGTHE EPITOPES OR DETERMINANTS DEFINED BY SPECIFIC MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES. THE SPECIFIC AIMS INCLUDE: (1) ISOLATING FRAGMENTS OF HUMAN APO A-1 AND APO B; (2) BINDING THESE FRAGMENTS TO 50 NM PARTICLES; AND (3) DEFINING THE STABILITYOF THESE SURROGATE LIPOPROTEINS. PHASE II FUNDING WILL BE REQUESTED TO PREPARE IMMUNOASSAY KITS, CONDUCT CLINICAL TRIALS, AND FOR PRODUCTION SCALEUP. AN IMMUNOASSAY WITH STABLE CONTROLS AND STANDARDS SHOULD IMPROVE DIAGNOSIS OF RISK FOR HEART DISEASE THEREBY REDUCINGMEDICAL COSTS BY EARLY INTERVENTION. THE GENERIC CONTROLS AND STANDARDS DEVELOPED ON THIS PROJECT WOULD BE USEFUL FOR OTHER ASSAYS BENEFITTING THE ENTIRE MEDICAL COMMUNITY AS WELL AS THE PATIENT.",

TRADITIONALLY, PROJECTOR AND RECEIVER TRANSDUCERS HAVE BEEN USED RECIPROCALLY WITH SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE. HOWEVER, SOME OF THE MATERIALS AND MANY OF THE DESIGN INNOVATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN USED TO BROADEN THE BANDWIDTH AND IMPROVE THE GENERAL PERFORMANCE OF RECEIVERS ARE NOT APPLICABLE TO PROJECTOR TRANSDUCERS. THE DESIGN OF EFFICIENT SONAR PROJECTORS RELIES UPON OPERATION OF THE DEVICE AT OR NEAR THE RESONANT FREQUENCY OF THE TRANSDUCER. THE TRADITIONAL TRADEOFF FOR PIEZOELECTRIC OR MAGNETOSTRICTIVE PROJECTOR TRANSDUCERS HAS BEEN TO SACRIFICE OUTPUT EFFICIENCY AND SIZE FOR BANDWIDTH. A PROJECTOR DESIGN IS AVAILABLE WHICH OVERCOMES THE SEVERITY OF THIS COMPROMISE. THE COMPOSITE TRANSDUCER DESIGN IS DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING PROPOSAL. A FEASIBILITY STUDY AND EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM IS PROPOSED WHICH WILL SERVE TO DEMONSTRATE THE TRANSDUCER CONCEPT.

BOTH EXPLOSIVE AND HYDRAULIC FRACTURING TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN USED WITH SUCCESS IN THE STIMULATION OF UNCONVENTIONAL GAS WELLS. BECAUSE OF THE UNUSUALLY LOW PERMEABILITIES OF UNCONVENTIONAL RESERVOIRS, AND THE FACT THAT THEIR PRODUCTION IS CONTROLLED BY NATURAL FRACTURES AND/OR LENTICULAR STRUCTURES, THERE IS CONSIDERABLE INTERESTIN DEVELOPING NOVEL WELL DRILLING, FRACTURING, AND COMPLETION TECHNIQUES SPECIALLY TAILORED TO THEIR PRODUCTION CHARACTERISTICS. WELL STIMULATION METHODS ARE REQUIRED THAT ARE PARTICULARLY APPLICABLE TO THE TREATMENT OF NATURALLY FRACTURED RESERVOIRS OR ARE SUITABLE FOR USE IN DIRECTIONALLY DRILLED HOLES. ONE PROMISING STIMULATION METHOD, UTILIZING GAS REFLECTION DYNAMICS WITH THE DETONATION OF CONVENTIONAL EXPLOSIVES, HAS FOUND CONSIDERABLE SUCCESS AND APPLICATION IN STRIPPER OIL WELL STIMULATION. THIS METHOD, WHILE OFFERING EXCELLENT FRACTURING POTENTIAL, HAS HERETOFORE BEEN LIMITED BY EXCESSIVE WELLBORE DAMAGE AND THE GENERATION OF FRACTURE PLUGGING FINES. TWO UNRELATED TECHNOLOGIES COULD BE COMBINED WITH THE GAS REFLECTION TECHNIQUES TO OVERCOME THESE LIMITATIONS. THE USE OF EXPLOSIVE CHARGE LINERS, DEVELOPED FOR FRACTURE CONTROLLED BLASTING APPLICATIONS, AND OF LOW-VELOCITY EXPLOSIVES DEVELOPED FOR FAIRLY CONVENTIONAL WELL SHOOTING COULD ELIMINATE THE WELLBORE DAMAGE AND FINES GENERATION PROBLEMS. THE INTEGRATED TECHNIQUE UNDER INVESTIGATION WOULD OFFER A DIRECTED, HIGH ENERGY GAS FRACTURING METHOD UNIQUELY SUITABLE FOR USE IN FRACTURED RESERVOIRS AND/OR DEVIATED HOLES.",

THERMAL NITRIDING OFFERS THE BULK PROCESSING CAPABILITY BUT FALLS SHORT IN THE AREA OF SUPERCONDUCTING PROPERTIES. PLASMA-ENHANCED THERMAL REACTION (PETR) NITRIDING EMPLOYING BATCH PROCESSING TECHNIQUES HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PROCESS NBN CONDUCTORS AT LOWER TEMPERATURES THAN CONVENTIONAL THERMAL NITRIDING. ITS ABILITY TO NITRIDEMATERIALS AT THESE LOWER TEMPERATURES HAS ALREADY BEEN DEMONSTRATED. THE LOWER TEMPERATURE OF PETR NITRIDING WILL RESULT IN SMALLER GRAINS WHEN COMPARED TO THERMAL NITRIDING. GRAIN SIZE DIRECTLY AFFECTS THE SUPERCONDUCTING PROPERTIES, AND SMALL GRAINS ARE REQUIRED FOR BEST RESULTS. PETR NITRIDING HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE LONG LENGTHS OF MULTIFILAMENT NBN WIRE, WITH GOOD SUPERCONDUCTING PROPERTIES, IN BULK FORM. THE PETR PROCESS ELIMINATES THE SLOW AND COSTLY METHOD OF SPUTTERING FILMS ON SUBSTRATES, WHICH CAN INHIBIT LARGE SCALE PROCESSING.

THIS PROGRAM IS DIRECTED AT A COST-EFFECTIVE AND RELIABLE METHOD FOR MAKING SILICON FOR DETECTORS WITH SENSITIVE DEPTHS BEYOND SEVERAL MILLIMETERS. THE METHOD IS BASED ON AN INNOVATIVE CONCEPT FOR CIRCUMVENTING THE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY NONUNIFORM DISTRIBUTION OF IMPURITIES. NONUNIFORM IMPURITY DISTRIBUTION HAS FRUSTRATED MANY PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS TO MAKE STABLE, COMPENSATED, VERY HIGH RESISTIVITY SILICON IN A PREDICTABLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE MANNER. PHASE I WILL CONCENTRATE ON DEVELOPING TECHNIQUES FOR SPECIALIZED MATERIAL EVALUATIONS, ON THE PROCESS FOR RESTORING CHARGE CARRIER LIFETIME AND TRAPFREE MATERIAL, AND ON PROVING THE FEASIBILITY OF THE CONCEPT. A PHASE II EFFORT WILL BE REQUIRED TO PRODUCE ENOUGH MATERIAL TO VERIFY THE REPRODUCIBLE QUALITY OF THE DETECTOR GRADE CRYSTALS AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE THEM IN QUANTITY AT A REASONABLE COST. A PREDICTABLE COMMERCIALLY VIABLE SOURCE OF ULTRA HIGH RESISTIVITY SILICON HAS ELUDED MANY PREVIOUS INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS. A SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM WILL REMOVE MANY DETECTOR DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING LIMITATIONS. BRONZE-PROCESSED NB(3)SN (NIOBIUM TIN) SUPERCONDUCTORS HAVE BEEN EXPLORED FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS, YIELDING CONSIDERABLE AND VALUABLE PROCESSING PARAMETERS AND TECHNIQUES. MUCH OF THE INTEREST IN BRONZE PROCESSING IS ROOTED IN THE FACT THAT THESE MATERIALS CAN BE PROCESSED AT ELEVATED TEMPERATURES, WHILE MAINTAINING A SOLID STATE. INCREASES INCURRENT DENSITIES HAVE BEEN HAMPERED BY THE WASTED VOLUME CREATED BY THE NON-SUPERCONDUCTING MATRIX. THE OBJECTIVE OFTHIS PROGRAM IS TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF SN IN THE MATRIX WHILE MAINTAINING REASONABLE DUCTILITY IN THE CONDUCTOR. THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED BY USING ALLOYING MATERIALS THAT CAN CARRY A HIGHER QUANTITY OF SN. EXPERIMENTS WILL USE SEVERAL DIFFERENT LEVELS OF SN TO DETERMINE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES CONCERNING DUCTILITY AND CURRENT DENSITIES IN THE FINAL CONDUCTOR. THE CONDUCTOR WILL CONTAIN AMOUNTS OF SN HIGHER THAN THE 13.5 WT% FOUND IN CONVENTIONAL DUCTILE BRONZE, WHILE MAINTAINING DUCTILITY AND THE ABILITY TO BE PROCESSED AT ELEVATED TEMPERATURES.",

THE AIM OF PHASE I RESEARCH IS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT ENZYMES ABLE TO CATALYZE THE SYNTHESIS OF THESE ANTIBIOTICS AT HIGH RATES CAN BE DERIVED FROM PENICILLIN AMIDASE. TO ACHIEVE THIS, MUTANTS WILL BE SELECTED FOLLOWING MUTAGENESIS OF CELLS THAT CARRY THE CLONED GENE FOR PENICILLIN AMIDASE BASED ON AN IMPROVED ABILITY TO HYDROLYZE A MODEL SUBSTRATE WITH A D-(-))-ALPHA-AMINOPHENYLACETYL MOIETY. THE RATES AT WHICH AMIDASES PURIFIED FROM THESE MUTANTS CATALYZE THE HYDROLYSISOF THE MODEL SUBSTRATE AND THE CONDENSATION OF D-(-)-ALPHA-AMINOPHENYLACETIC ACID WITH 6-AMINOPENICILLANIC ACID TO PRODUCE AMPICILLIN WILL BE DETERMINED AND COMPARED TO THE RATES OBSERVED WITH THE WILD-TYPE AMIDASE.

C5A IS A KEY CONTRIBUTORY, POSSIBLY NECESSARY FACTOR IN THE PATHOLOGICAL COURSE OF ARDS. THE PROTEINS CAPABLE OF INACTIVATING C5A NOTED IN THE LITERATURE ARE POORLY CHARACTERIZED. SYNERGEN'S SCIENTISTS HAVE SELECTED ONE OF THESE PROTEINS TO ISOLATE FROM HUMAN TISSUE, THEN CHARACTERIZE ITS MODE OF ACTION. AN ASSAY BASED ON THIS BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY WILL BE USED TO PURIFY, CHARACTERIZE, CLONE AND EXPRESS THE PROTEIN BY RECOMBINANT DNA TECHNOLOGIES. BY REDUCING THE ACTION OF C5A IN PATIENTS AT RISK FOR ARDS, WE EXPECT THAT THE PROTEIN WILL PROVIDE A USEFUL THERAPEUTIC AGENT FOR PREVENTION OR AMELIORATION OF THE PATHOLOGY.",

RELATIVELY HIGH EXTERNAL CONCENTRATIONS ARE REQUIRED FOR EFFECTIVE PROTEIN SYNTHESIS INHIBITION DUE IN PART TO LIMITED CELL PENETRATION OF SOME DERIVATIVES. IT IS PROPOSED TO DEVELOP THE USE OF HIGHLY SOLUBLE, CELL-PENETRATING, AMPHIPHILIC OLIGONUCLEOTIDE CONJUGATES, WHICH INITIAL EXPERIMENTS SHOW TO BE 10 TIMES MORE EFFECTIVE THAN NONCONJUGATED OLIGOMERS. THE GOAL IS TOPRODUCE EFFECTIVE ANTISENSE OLIGONUCLEOTIDES WITH SIGNIFICANT ANTIVIRAL ACTIVITY. IN PHASE I, POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL CONJUGATES OF NORMAL AND METHYLPHOSPHONATE DNA WILL BE SYNTHESIZED AND PURIFIED, AND THEIR ABILITY TO SELECTIVELY INHIBIT HEMOGLOBIN SYNTHESIS IN CULTURED MOUSE CELLS WILL BE COMPARED. IN PHASE II, IT IS PLANNED TO CONSTRUCT AND TEST THE OPTIMIZED CONJUGATES FOR THEIR ABILITY TO INHIBIT THE GROWTH OF HIV IN CULTURED CELLS. THIS WORK WILL THEN BE EXTENDED TO ANIMAL TOXICITY AND PHARMACOLOGIC STUDIES TO BRING THESE COMPOUNDS TO THE INVESTIGATIONAL NEW DRUG STAGE FOR TESTING IN HUMANS.",

FOR THE ASSIMILATION OF THE NEW THEORIES INTO \"REAL WORLD\" DESIGN, FCS DESIGNERS WILL HAVE TO TRANSLATE THE THEORY INTO PHYSICAL UNDERSTANDING. THE PROPOSED WORK IS A DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT APPROACH TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN THE GENERAL THEORY AND COMPUTATIONAL METHODS OF LINEAR MULTI-VARIABLE ROBUSTNESS PROCEDURES, AND PHYSICAL UNDERSTANDING IN THE CONTEXT OF PRACTICAL FLIGHT CONTROL DESIGN. THE APPROACH ISBASED ON COMBINING SINGULAR VALUE AND STRUCTURED SINGULAR VALUE PROCEDURES WITH A LITERAL (SYMBOLIC) DEVELOPMENT WHICHLEADS TO DIRECT IDENTIFICATION OF IMPORTANT AIRCRAFT DYNAMICAND CONTROL SYSTEM DESIGN PARAMETERS AND THEIR CONNECTIONS WITH ROBUST PERFORMANCE CRITERIA.

THE METHOD EMPLOYS SAMPLED DATA CORRELATION USING A SET OF MOVING \"WINDOWS\" OF VARYING LENGTH IN TIME AND A RUNNING LEAST SQUARES ESTIMATION OF THE COEFFICIENTS OF A DIFFERENCE EQUATION MODEL IN THE TIME DOMAIN FOLLOWED BY CONVERSION TO THE FREQUENCY DOMAIN FOR INTERPRETATION OF MODAL FREQUENCIESAND DAMPING RATIOS.

THESE REQUIREMENTS IMPLY THE USE OF TWO TOWER-MOUNTED PANNING CAMERAS OUTSIDE THE OBJECT-DISPERSAL AREA. THE PHASE I EFFORT WILL DEVELOP THE MISSING COMPONENTS OF THE VIDEO LOCATION AND RECOGNITION SYSTEM AND WILL DEMONSTRATE THEM USING TAU IMAGE PROCESSING HARDWARE OPERATING ON PHOTOGRAPHS OR VIDEO TAPES OF THE DISPERSED OBJECTS IN TERRAIN BACKGROUND. NO HARDWARE NEED BE PURCHASED BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR THESE DEMONSTRATIONS. PHASE II WILL COMPLETE THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT THE CAMERA SYSTEMS THE IMAGE PROCESSOR, THE OPERATOR INTERFACE, AND THE OVERALL SYSTEM CONTROLLER.",

THIS WAVEFORM MAY DIFFER FROM THAT OCCURRING AT THE DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE GAGE LOCATION. UNDER THIS PROJECT, THE DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE GAGE PROBE WILL BE MODIFIED TO ADD A GAGE TO MEASURE THE SIDE-ON PRESSURE IN ADDITION TO THE DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE. THIS MODIFIED PROBE WILL BE EVALUATED IN SHOCK TUBE TESTS.",

IF THE BASE IS TO SURVIVE AND FUNCTION AFTER A NEARBY NUCLEAR ATTACK, IT MUST HAVE INDEPENDENT LIFE SUPPORT AND POWER GENERATION SYSTEMS. RESEARCH INTO OXYGEN STORAGE AND GENERATION METHODS IS NEEDED TO OFFER SAFE, RELIABLE SYSTEMS FOR THESE MISSILE BASES. PAST STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT STORING OXYGEN AS A CRYOGENIC LIQUID (LOX) IS DANGEROUS AND THAT OXYGEN STORED IN THE FORM OF A SOLID, AS SODIUM CHLORATE CANDLES, OFFERS AN ECONOMICALLY VIABLE AND SAFE ALTERNATIVE TO LOX. FOR THIS STUDY, WE PROPOSE TO REVIEW AND ANALYZE THE FEASIBILITY OF STORING LARGE AMOUNTS OF OXYGEN IN CHLORATE CANDLES WHICH WOULD GENERATE OXYGEN SAFELY ON DEMAND.

ANTENNAS MOST LIKELY TO SURVIVE SUCH EVENTS ARE BURIED OR LOW PROFILE NEAR-THE-EARTH ANTENNAS. HOWEVER, THE GROUND WAVE FIELD STRENGTH FOR SUCH ANTENNAS IS NOT EASILY CALCULATED. USUALLY, SUCH CALCULATIONS ARE BASED ON COMPARING THE ANTENNA IN QUESTION TO A \"STANDARD\" ELECTRICALLY SHORT VERTICAL MONOPOLE. FIELD STRENGTH CURVES ARE READILY AVAILABLE FOR THE \"STANDARD\" ANTENNA FROM SUCH SOURCES AS THE CCIR RECOMMENDATION 368-4. SUCH GAIN DETERMINATIONS AT ZERO DEGREES ELEVATION ANGLE, HOWEVER, ASSUME PERFECTLY CONDUCTING EARTH. THIS METHOD CANNOT BE APPLIED TO BURIED ANTENNAS SINCE THEY WOULD NOT RADIATE IN A PREFECTLY CONDUCTING EARTH. THEIR ABILITY TO RADIATE DEPENDS UPON THE EARTH'S FINITE CONDUCTIVITY AND PERMITTIVITY. THEREFORE, OTHER METHODS OF CALCULATION MUST BE USED. TCI PROPOSES TO UTILIZE ITS ANALYTICAL EXPERTISE TO ACCURATELY ANALYZE BURIED OR NEAR-EARTH HF ANTENNAS AND DEVELOP SPACE WAVE GAIN, EFFICIENCY AND GROUND WAVE STRENGTH OF THESE BURIED OR NEAR-EARTH ANTENNAS. A GOAL OF THE EFFORT WILL BE TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE GROUND WAVE LAUNCHING EFFICIENCY OF BURIED AND NEAR-EARTH ANTENNAS AND THE MORE CONVENTIONAL VERTICAL MONOPOLES, WHICH WILL PERMIT THE USE OF AVAILABLE GROUND WAVE PROPAGATION CURVES AND CALCULATION TECHNIQUES TO PREDICT THE PERFORMANCE OF C(3) APPLICATIONS OF BURIED AND NEAR-EARTH ANTENNAS.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE CENTRAL PURPOSE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP A FLEXIBLE SYSTEM FOR SELECTIVE DELIVERY OF FLUORESCENT DYES, PHOTOACTIVE AGENTS, AND DRUGS TO SUBPOPULATIONS OF NEURONS DEEP WITHIN THE RODENT NERVOUS SYSTEM IN VIVO. A NOVEL LATEX NANOSPHERE DELIVERY SYSTEM (LNDS) WILL BE DEVELOPED AND REFINED TO ALLOW NEUROANATOMICAL, DEVELOPMENTAL, AND PHARMACOLOGIC STUDIES. DURING PHASE I, THE LNDS WILL BE DEVELOPED AS A NEUROANATOMICAL RESEARCH TOOL. PHASE II WOULD CONTINUE THESE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS WHILE EMPHASIZING DEVELOPMENT OF SELECTIVE DRUG DELIVERY VIA THE LNDS. FLUORESCENT DYES AND PHOTOACTIVE AGENTS WILL BE INCORPORATED WITHIN LATEX NANOSPHERES OF DEFINED SIZE, SURFACE PROPERTIES, AND NEURONAL SELECTIVITY. NANOSPHERE TRANSPORT WITHIN THE RODENT NERVOUS SYSTEM WILL BE QUANTIFIED. SPECIFIC AIM I WILL BE DIRECTED TOWARD THE FABRICATION AND OPTIMIZATION OF SEVERAL TYPES OF LNDS. SPECIFIC AIM II WILL FOCUS ON ANALYSIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF THE NANOSPHERES. SPECIFIC AIMS III AND IV INVOLVE ASSESSMENT OF UPTAKE BY CULTURED RAT NEOCORTICAL NEURONS PRIOR TO QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF TRANSPORT BY THE LNDS WITHIN TWO MODEL SYSTEMS: CALLOSAL PROJECTIONS TO MOTOR CORTEX AND RETINAL GANGLION CELL PROJECTIONS TO SUPERIOR COLLICULUS IN RODENTS. PRELIMINARY STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED LNDS PRODUCTION, ANALYSES, AND BIOLOGICAL TRANSPORT. THUS, THE STAGE IS SET TO DEVELOP THIS UNIQUELY POWERFUL METHODOLOGY TO PRODUCE UNIFORM, SUBMICRON PARTICLES FOR SELECTIVE CELL TARGETING. THE NEUROSCIENCES COMMUNITY IN PARTICULAR AND THE BIOMEDICALCOMMUNITY IN GENERAL WILL BENEFIT FROM A GENERALLY APPLICABLE LNDS TECHNOLOGY. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT APPROXIMATELY 5,000-10,000 NEUROSCIENTISTS WOULD PURCHASE SUCH PRODUCTS IN THE FIRST YEAR ALONE FOR APPLICATION TOWARDTHE STUDY OF DEVELOPMENT, REGENERATION, AND TRANSPLANTATION WITHIN THE CNS.. THE POTENTIAL FOR CELL SPECIFIC DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEMS IS OF CLEARLY LARGE COMMERCIAL INTEREST.",

NUMEROUS RADAR DESIGNS HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTED, BUT NONE HAVE RESULTED IN A SATISFACTORY SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF LOCATING TARGETS IN FOLIAGE. THE PROPOSED RADAR SYSTEM CONSISTS OF TWO AIRCRAFT FLYING ROUGHLY PARALLEL PATHS; AT LEAST ONE AIRCRAFT IS TRANSMITTING, BOTH ARE RECEIVING. THIS SYSTEM IS UNIQUE IN AT LEAST TWO MAJOR RESPECTS: (1) THE USE OF LOW ANGLE OF INCIDENCE RADIATION WHICH REDUCES LOSSES DUE TO FOLIAGE, ALLOWS HIGHER FREQUENCIES, AND ALLOWS RANGE RESOLUTION AS A HEIGHT DISCRIMINANT; AND (2) THE USE OF INTERFEROMETER RADAR PRINCIPLES ALLOWS RESOLUTION IN THE CROSS-TRACK COORDINATE. THE RESULTING HEIGHT AND CROSS-TRACK RESOLUTION, IN CONJUNCTION WITH ALONG-TRACK SAR PROCESSING, PRODUCE THREE-DIMENSIONAL RESOLUTION IN POSITION. OTHER FEATURES INCLUDE THE AVAILABILITY OF HEIGHT AND BISTATIC RCS AS TARGET DISCRIMINANTS. IN ADDITION, THE WIDEBAND FREQUENCY SWEEP OF THE PROPOSED WAVEFORM ALLOWS THE FREQUENCY DEPENDENCE OF TARGETS RCS TO BE A DISCRIMINANT.",

THE TWO MOST DIFFICULT PROBLEMS IN BUILDING SUCH A SENSOR ARE TO ARRANGE SEVERAL DETECTOR ARRAYS SO THAT THEY APPEAR TO BE CONTIGUOUS AND ALIGNED AND TO DESIGN A COLLECTOR TELESCOPE TO IMAGE A REASONALBY WIDE SWATH WIDTH ON THE ARRAYS WITH OPTICAL QUALITY TO MATCH THE REQUIRED RESOLUTION. THE PHASE 1 EFFORT IS TO CARRY OUT THE DESIGN, INCLUDING THE POSITIONING OF THE FILTERS THAT WILL DEFINE THE SPECTRAL BANDPASS, AND TO PRODUCE PLANS THAT CAN BE USED IN PHASE 2 TO FABRICATE A BREADBOARD FOR AIRCRAFT TESTING OF THE CONCEPT. THE ARRAYS TO BE USED ARE OFF THE SHELF ARRAYS, NOW BEING MANUFACTURED IN THE UNITED STATES. SEVERAL OPTIONS WILL BE EXPLORED FOR THE TELESCOPE TYPE INCLUDING THE TELESCOPE BEING DESIGNED FOR MODIS-T AND THE THEMATIC MAPPER TELESCOPE. CALCULATIONS SHOW THAT A COLLECTOR OF ABOUT A METER IN DIAMETER IS REQUIRED SO THE DESIGNS WILL BE CONSIDERED FOR LATER MANUFACTURE IN THAT SIZE. THE USE OF LIGHT WEIGHT MIRRORS, MADE BY CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION, WILL BE EXAMINED AS A POSSIBLE METHOD OF PRODUCING A LARGE MIRROR OF LIGHT WEIGHT MORE ECONOMICALLY THAN THAT POSSIBLE WITH PRESENT METHODS.",

THE STRENGTH AND HARDNESS OF TI ALLOYS CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED BY REFINING THE MICROSTRUCTURE THROUGH RAPID SOLIDIFICATION PROCESSING (RSP). ADDITIONAL REFINEMENT OF MICROSTRUCTURE AND A REDUCTION OF FORGING TEMPERATURE CAN BE ATTAINED BY TEMPORARY ALLOYING WITH HYDROGEN. A REDUCED FORGING TEMPERATURE WILL LEAD TO THE PRESERVATION OF REFINED MICROSTRUCTURE OBTAINED BY RSP. IT IS PROPOSED HERE THAT A DETAILED STUDY BE MADE OF THE RESPONSE OF SOME RAPIDLY SOLIDIFIED TI ALLOYS WITH NOVEL ADDITIVES TO HYDROGENATION AND DEHYDROGENATION. THE ALLOYS PROPOSED ARE EUTECTOID FORMERS (TI-4CU) AND COMPOUND FORMERS (TI-1.0B, 1.0C).

PRELIMINARY CLINICAL STUDIES INDICATE THAT WARTS, LIKE CANCER TUMORS, MAY BE CLEARED AS ARESULT OF BEING HEATED TO TEMPERATURES IN THE HYPERTHERMIC RANGE (42-47 DEGREES (C)). PROPOSED IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF ARELATIVELY SIMPLE AND INEXPENSIVE HYPERTHERMIA SYSTEM CAPABLE OF TREATING WARTS AND OTHER HEAT-SENSITIVE SKIN DISEASES. THE DEVICE, A PORTABLE, SELF-CONTAINED, MICROPROCESSOR-CONTROLLED SYSTEM WELL SUITED FOR USE IN AN OFFICE PRACTICE, WILL BE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING TAILORED THERMAL DISTRIBUTIONS IN SKIN TISSUES BY DYNAMICALLY CONTROLLING THE ACOUSTIC FREQUENCY AND POWER OUTPUT OF AN ULTRASOUND TRANSDUCER, AND THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER BOLUS THAT COUPLES THE ENERGY TO THE BODY. PHASE I OF THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITYOF THIS CONCEPT BY FABRICATING SEVERAL CLINICALLY USEFUL APPLICATORS AND TESTING THEIR PERFORMANCE BOTH IN THE LABORATORY AND CLINIC. KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS PHASE IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A TRANSDUCER CAPABLE OF EFFICIENTLY AND UNIFORMLY RADIATING ULTRASOUND OVER THE FREQUENCY RANGE FROM5 TO 10 MHZ, AND THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF PILOT CLINICAL STUDIES DEMONSTRATING SAFETY AND EFFICACY FOR CLEARING HUMAN WARTS. BASED ON PHASE I RESULTS, PHASE II WILL REQUEST FUNDING TO DEVELOP THE DEDICATED ELECTRONICS PACKAGE AND FLUID CONDITIONING HARDWARE NECESSARY TO PRODUCE A PROTOTYPE DEVICE AND TO CONDUCT FULL SCALE CLINICAL TRIALS. FROM THESE INVESTIGATIONS, IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT OPTIMIZED TREATMENT PROTOCOLS WILL EMERGE THAT CONFIRM THE POTENCY OF THIS NEW THERAPY, AND THEREBY CREATE DEMAND FOR COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS.",

IN FACT, BROADBASED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED ON THE BASIS OF CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENTS IN RELIABILITY AND COST REDUCTION. THE RECENT DEVELOPMENT OF DENSE, VACUUM-TIGHT ALUMINUM NITRIDE (A1N) PRESENTS THE POSSIBILITY OF A ONE MORE MAJOR IMPROVEMENT IN THIS TECHNOLOGY. PRESENTLY, THE PLASMA-CONFINEMENT BORE IS MADE OF BERYLLIUM OXIDE (BEO), WHICH IS EXPENSIVE, POISONOUS, AND SUFFERS FROM LIMITED AVAILABILITY. A1N, WHICH IS BEING DEVELOPED AS A HEATSINK MATERIAL FOR THE ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY, IS POTENTIALLY VERY LOW COST, NON-TOXIC AND IS AVAILABLE FROM A WIDE RANGE OF DOMESTIC SUPPLIERS. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL EVALUATE THE SUITABILITY OF A1N AS A LASER BORE MATERIAL. TECHNIQUES FOR METALIZING AND BRAZING THE MATERIAL MUST BE DEVELOPED AND THE MATERIAL'S ABILITY TOWITHSTAND THE HEAT LOADS AND PLASMA EROSION EFFECTS OF AN AIR-COLLED ION LASER MUST BE TESTED.",

ABOUT 20% OF AMERICANS ARE HYPERSENSITIVE TO VENOMS OF HYMENOPTERAN INSECTS. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO DEVELOP AND DEMONSTRATE THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF A DEVICE USED IN FIRST AID TREATMENT OF VENOMOUS BITES AND STINGS. THIS DEVICE APPLIES HIGH VOLTAGE, LOW CURENT ELECTRIC SHOCK TO THE WOUND SITE AND MAY BE USED BY NONPROFESSIONALS. THE PROPOSED TREATMENT METHOD WOULD REPLACE EXISTING SNAKE BITE KITS AND ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK TREATMENT KITS, AND REDUCE THE USE OF ANTI-VENIN WITH CONCOMMITANT ANAPHYLAXIA AND SERUM SICKNESS. THE SPECIFIC AIMS ARE TO: ESTABLISH THE SCIENTIFIC FOUNDATION OF FIELD EXPERIENCE PUBLISHED IN 1986; UNDERSTANDTHE LIMITATIONS OF THE EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF THE TREATMENT;OPTIMIZE THE PARAMETERS OF DELIVERY OF THE ELECTRIC SHOCK FOR MAXIMUM EFFICACY AND SAFETY WITH MINIMUM ASSOCIATED PAIN; AND DEVELOP A DEVICE FOR FIELD APPLICATION OF THE TREATMENT METHOD. THE PHASE I METHODOLOGY INCLUDES DESIGNING INSTRUMENTATION, USING ANIMAL MODELS TO DEMONSTRATE THE MORTALITY DIFFERENCESBETWEEN GROUPS RECEIVING TREATED VERSUS UNTREATED VENOMS, PERFORMING A SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS OF COMPREHENSIVE CLINICAL RESULTS TO DATE, AND DEVELOPING A CLINICAL PROTOCOL.",

VERAX CORPORATION HAS DEVELOPED A NOVEL SYSTEM FOR THE MASS CULTURE OF HYBRIDOMA CELLS AS WELL AS ANCHORAGE-PREFERRED AND ANCHORAGE-DEPENDENT GENETICALLY ENGINEERED MAMMALIAN CELLS. WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY GROWN MURINE HYBRIDOMA CELLS IN SERUM-FREE MEDIA CONTAINING A TOTAL PROTEIN CONTENT OF 1 MU G/ML. WE NOW PROPOSE TO EXTEND OUR DEVELOPMENT WORK TO STUDIES OF GENETICALLY-ENGINEERED MAMMALIAN CELLS. OF PARTICULAR INTEREST IS AN ANALYSIS OF THE FEASIBILITY OF GROWING SEVERAL MAMMALIAN CELL LINES IN A WELL DEFINED, SERUM-FREE MEDIUM IN CONTINUOUS CULTURES THAT UTILIZE OUR PROPRIETARY CELL IMMOBILIZING MATRIX MATERIAL. OUR GOAL IS TO DEVELOP MINIMAL CULTURE MEDIUM FOR THE CONTINUOUS GROWTH AND ENHANCED PRODUCTIVITY OF THESE CELLS WHEN THEY ARE IMMOBILIZED IN THE COLLAGEN MATRIX. OUR PRELIMINARY STUDIES WITH GENETICALLY-ENGINEERED CELLS DERIVED FROM CHINESE HAMSTER OVARY, HUMAN EMBRYONIC KIDNEY OR MURINE MAMMARY CELL LINES IN T-FLASK CULTURES SUGGEST THAT VERY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES EXIST BETWEEN THOSE CELL LINES IN TERMS OF THEIR GROWTH AND THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT PRODUCTION POTENTIAL.

THE SECONDARY CORRECTION MAGNETS ARE FOR THE HIGHER ORDER CORRECTORS (QUADRUPOLES, SEXTUPOLES AND OCTUPOLES). ALTHOUGH AT PRESENT MAJOR EFFORTS ARE UNDER WAY TOWARD THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF SSC DIPOLES AND QUADRUPOLES, THE CORRECTION MAGNETS POSE A DIFFERENT SET OF PROBLEMS AND CHALLENGES. FIRST OF ALL, THESE MAGNETS MUST BE PACKED IN A SMALL SPACE, WHICH REQUIRES CAREFUL COMPACTING IN THE COIL PACKAGE. SECONDLY, THESE MAGNETS REQUIRE INDIVIDUAL CURRENT CONTROLS, SO EACH MAGNET REQUIRES INDIVIDUAL LEADS. FOR THIS REASON, THE CURRENT MUST BE KEPT LOW, IN THE RANGE OF 50 TO 100 A, IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE HELIUM BOIL-OFF. THIRDLY, THE USE OF SMALL WIRES MAKES IT DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING TO WIND THESE MAGNETS SO THAT THEY WILL NOT REQUIRE TRAINING. IN PHASE I, THIS PROJECT WILL DESIGN AND STUDY THE TYPE OF MAGNET BEST FOR THE CORRECTION COIL. THIS WILL INCLUDE THE COMPARISON OF COIL PACKAGES, CONDUCTOR AND COIL DESIGN, COIL FABRICATION AND ASSEMBLY PLANS, AND THE DESIGN OF THE IRON YOKE AND CRYOSTAT. PHASE II WILL BE TO DEVELOP THE CONDUCTOR, FABRICATE MODEL COILS, AND DEMONSTRATE THAT SUCH COILS MEET THE PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS AND ARE COST-EFFECTIVE FOR THE SSC.",

THE PROGRAM CONSISTS OF 1) SMOKING CONTROL (USE OF NO-SMOKING AND SMOKING PERMITTED SIGNS AND VERBAL PROMPTS TO CONTROL SMOKING), 2) SMOKING DISCOURAGEMENT (USE OF HUMOROUS ANTI-SMOKING POSTERS AND EDUCATIONAL MATERIAL PLACED THROUGHOUT THE WORKSITE), AND 3) SMOKING CESSATION (USE OF A STRUCTURED GROUP SMOKING CESSATION PROGRAM CONSISTING OF SIX ONE-HOUR SESSIONS OVER ATWO WEEK PERIOD UTILIZING GROUP SUPPORT, FORMAL DECLARATION OF QUITTING ON A SPECIFIED DATE, AND RELATED BEHAVIORAL PROCEDURES. THREE CHEMICAL PLANTS IN THE-NEW-ORLEANS AREA HAVE AGREED TO PARTICIPATE. TWO WILL BE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO RECEIVE COMPREHENSIVE SMOKING CONTROL, DISCOURAGEMENT, AND CESSATION WITH THE THIRD RECEIVING SMOKING CESSATION ALONE.

FIRST, IS THE USE OF TWO DIFFERENT SCINTILLATOR MATERIALS - SODIUM IODIDE, WHICH WILL SERVE AS THE PRIMARY, HIGH SENSITIVITY GAMMA DETECTOR AND ALOS AS AN ANTICOINCIDENCE SHIELD, AND GADOLINIUM ORTHOSILICATE FOR ITS THERMAL NEUTRON SENSITIVITY. THE SECOND KEY ELEMENT IS THE USE OF A NEWLY DEVELOPED, LARGE AREA (TO CENTIMETERS IN DIAMETER), HIGH GAIN, SILICON AVALANCHE PHOTODIODE (APD) AS THE LIGHT DETECTOR.

THIS PROCEDURE USUALLY INVOLVES A TIME CONSUMING CULTURING STEP, IN ORDER TO DIFFERENTIATE GONOCOCCAL ORGANISMS FROM OTHERS NORMALLY PRESENT IN THESE SPECIMENS. A POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION BY IMMUNOLOGICAL REAGENTS WOULD GREATLY AID IN THIS IDENTIFICATION AND ALSO, IF SENSITIVE AND SPECIFIC, COULD POSSIBLY ELIMINATE THE NEED AND EXPENSE OF PRIOR CULTURING. UNFORTUNATELY, PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS AT DEVELOPING ANTISERA SPECIFIC FOR GONOCOCCI HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN IDENTIFYING THESE ORGANISMS BECAUSE THEY ARE ANTIGENICALLY VERY HETEROGENEOUS, WITH MANY SEROVARS. ANTISERA MADE AGAINST A PARTICULAR STRAIN OF GONOCOCCI OFTEN FAIL TO REACT WITH OTHER, EQUALLY PATHOGENIC STRAINS. INSTEAD, SUCH ANTISERA ARE MORE USUALLY STRAIN-SPECIFIC. RECENT STUDIES ON THE ANTIGENIC COMPONENTS OF GONOCOCCI INDICATE THAT CERTAIN PROTEIN COMPONENTS MAY BE ABLE TO GENERATE A MORE \"UNIVERSAL\" ANTI PATHOGENIC GONOCOCCAL ANTISERUM. AMONG THESE COMPONENTS IS THE PROTEIN PILIN ASSOCIATED WITH THE PILI OF THESE MICROBES. THE AMINO ACID SEQUENCE OF THIS PROTEIN HAS RECENTLY BECOME AVAILABLE. BY USING SYNTHETIC PEPTIDES BASED ON THIS SEQUENCE IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO DEVELOP ANTISERA DIRECTED AGAINST STRUCTURES COMMON TO OTHER STRAINS OF GONOCOCCAL PILI, THEREBY GENERATING A USEFUL IMMUNODIAGNOSTIC REAGENT.",

SINCE THE ENTIRE STM UNIT IS SMALL ENOUGH TO BE MOUNTED ON A6-IN CONFLAT FLANGE, IT CAN BE READILY INSTALLED ONTO ANY ULTRA-HIGH VACUUM CHAMBER WITH A STANDARD SIZED PORT. THE INSTRUMENT WILL BE DESIGNED TO OPERATE IN BOTH VACUUM AND AMBIENT AIR ENVIRONMENTS. FURTHERMORE, THE STM DESIGN WILL NOT ONLY BE USER-FRIENDLY TO THE OPERATOR BUT WILL ALSO INCORPORATE FEATURES ALLOWING EASE OF MANUFACTURE AND MAINTENANCE.

THE ACTIVELY COOLED TECHNIQUES TO DECOYS REQUIRES FABRICATION OF ACTIVELY COOLED NOSE TIPS TO SMALLER SCALE CONFIGURATIONS. THIS CREATES A NEED TO SYSTEMATICALLY INVESTIGATE ACTIVE COOLING CONCEPTS FOR APPLICATION TO THE SELECTED MISSION. A CONCERN OF PRIMARY IMPORTANCE IS HOW EXISTING MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY AND MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY CAN BE EXTENDED TO THE MORE SEVERE HEATING LOADS OF DECOYS IN A TIMELY AND COST EFFECTIVE MANNER. THE EFFORT PROPOSED WILL APPLY ACTIVE COOLING DESIGN TECHNIQUES TO DECOYS TO DETERMINE THE MOST FAVORABLE CONCEPT (GJNT OR TCNT). THE RESULTS OF THE DESIGN ANALYSIS WILL THEN BE EMPLOYED TO DETERMINE THE MANUFACTURING APPROACH. CRITICAL FABRICATION STEPS WILL BE DEFINED AND DEMONSTRATED.",

THIS ABILITY WILL INCREASE EVEN MORE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS WHEN NEW SUPERCOMPUTERS BECOME OPERATIONAL, PERMITTING COMPLETE PROPULSION SYSTEMS TO BE ANALYZED. OPTIMUM AERODYNAMIC CONFIGURATIONS REQUIRE ANALYSIS OF COMPLEX INTERNAL GEOMETRICS, ESPECIALLY IN THE TRANSONIC AND MODERATELY SUPERSONIC REGIMES WHERE MAXIMUM DRAG OCCURS. INCLUDED IN THESE TECHNIQUES SHOULD BE THE CAPABILITY TO ANALYZE WALL INJECTION AND COMBUSTION. THE USE OF COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS OFFERS THE POTENTIAL OF SUPPLEMENTING AND IN SOME CASES REPLACING EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING WIND TUNNEL ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. THE PROPOSED EFFORT WILL APPLY COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS AND A SOLID STATE HEAT PIPE CONCEPT TO INVESTIGATE COMBUSTOR EFFICIENCY. THE ANALYSIS WILL INCLUDE AXIAL WALL INJECTION, STUT INJECTION, AND CHEMICAL REACTIONS. THE TECHNIQUE PROPOSED IS CAPABLE OF MULTITASKING AND MULTIGRIDS. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS CAPABILITY WOULD REDUCE COMBUSTOR DEVELOPMENT COSTS, REDUCE DEVELOPMENT TIME AND PERMIT EXTREMELY DETAILED AERODYNAMIC CONFIGURATION OPTIMIZATION.",

DEPRESSED COLLECTORS ARE COMMONLY USED IN CONVENTIONAL TUBESFOR EFFICIENCY ENHANCEMENT, AND IT IS ESTIMATED THAT AN APPLICATION OF THIS TECHNOLOGY TO GYROTRON AMPLIFIERS COULD RESULT IN AN IMPROVEMENT OF AT LEAST 50% IN EFFICIENCY, AND A SAVINGS OF OVER $140 MILLION IN A 200 MW SYSTEM. THE APPROACH WILL BE TO APPLY AND MODIFY CONCEPTS FOR DEPRESSED COLLECTORS, DEVELOPED FOR CONVENTIONAL MICROWAVE TUBES, FOR USE IN GYROTRONS. BEAMS USED IN GYROTRONS HAVE SUBSTANTIAL PERPENDICULAR ENERGY, WHICH MUST BE CONVERTED TO AXIAL MOTION BEFORE COLLECTION.

THESE EFFORTS INVOVLE LARGE STORAGE RING OR LINEAR ACCELERATORS AND MAGNETIC WIGGLER MAGNETS SEVERAL METERS LONG. AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO THESE LARGE AND EXPENSIVE UNDERTAKINGS IS TO CONSTRUCT AN FEL WITH A LOW ENERGY ELECTRON BEAM (< 1 MEV) AND AN OPTICAL PUMP FIELD PROVIDED BY A LASER BEAM. THE LATTER APPROACH HAS SEVERAL TECHNOLOGICAL PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH IT WHICH UP TO NOW HAVE BEEN INSURMOUNTABLE. WE PURPOSE TO OVERCOME THESE TECHNOLOGICAL PROBLEMS WITH AN INNOVATIVE ELECTRON GUN DESIGN WHICH HAS ALREADY EXHIBITED BRIGHTNESS VALUES 10(4) HIGHER THAN THOSE AVAILABLE FOR LARGE ACCELERATORS. THIS GUN COULD BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE EXCIMER LASERS TO OPERATE AN OSCILLATOR IN THE XUVAND VUV WAVELENGTH REGIONS. THE FIRST PHASE OF THIS PROGRAM WILL ANALYZE THE FEL GAIN AND OPERATING PARAMETERS AND IDENTIFY THE KEY ISSUES FOR THEDESIGN OF THE OSCILLATOR CAVITY.

FOR APPLICATIONS TO POINTING PAYLOADS, THE SYSTEM MUST DETERMINE SOLAR ASPECT ANGLE WITH AN ACCURACY OF 0.4 ARC-SECONDS WITH UPDATES AVAILABLE AT 4 MILLISECOND INTERVALS. SINCE TRACKING FUNCTIONS TYPICALLY USE A SMALL SUBSET OF THE SENSOR PIXELS AND THE APPROXIMATE LOCATION OF THIS SUBSET CAN BE DETERMINED FROM THE PREVIOUS SCAN, THE READ TIME CAN BE REDUCED BY CLOCKING THE UNWANTED PIXELS AT A VERY RAPID RATE. THEREFORE, CIRCUITS WERE DESIGNED TO READ THE CCD ARRAY AT TWO RATES: AT A SLOW RATE (13 KHZ) FORPIXELS NEAR THE SOLAR EDGE AND AT A HIGH SPEED (3.3 MHZ) FORTHE REMAINING PIXELS. THE DUAL READ-OUT RATE SCHEME WAS TESTED DURING PHASE I USING A LINEAR CCD ARRAY ILLUMINATED BY A HELIUM-NEON LASER WITH A KNIFE EDGE IN THE BEAM TO SIMULATE THE SOLAR EDGE. THESE TESTS DEMONSTRATED THE FEASIBILITY OF THE DUAL-RATE, READ-OUT TECHNIQUE FOR SOLAR EDGE TRACKING AND SHOW THAT THE REQUIRED UPDATE RATE CAN BE ACHIEVED WITH LOW-POWER LEVELS FOR CONTROL AND DATA ACQUISITION.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         TO MOVE TOWARDS MACHINE REASONING ABOUT WEATHER MAPS AND IMAGES, IT IS PROPOSED TO DEVELOP A SCHEME TO REPRESENT KNOWLEDGE ABOUT MAPS AND IMAGES FOR EFFICIENT USE IN AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (LISP PROGRAMMING) ENVIRONMENT. IT IS PROPOSED TO ORGANIZE THE SYSTEM AS A CONTROL ROUTINE TOGETHER WITH THE KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION AND THE LOWER LEVEL ALGORITHMS FOR RECOGNIZING AND MANIPULATING MAP COMPONENTS (ISOLINES, FRONTS, TROUGHS, CYCLONES) AND FOR LOCATING IMAGE COMPONENTS (CLOUD BOUNDARIES). THE KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION WILL CONSIST OF TWO PARTS: \"REFERENCE EXPERTISE\" ABOUT THE COMPONENTS AND THEIR STRUCTURAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND \"WORKING MEMORY\" OF DETAILS ABOUT THE MAPS AND IMAGES CURRENTLY BEING PROCESSED. THE CONTROL PROGRAM WILL INTEGRATE THE MAP AND IMAGE PROCESSING ALGORITHMS WITH THE KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION TO COORDINATE AND SEQUENCE THE SYSTEM. THE PHILOSOPHY OF THIS APPROACH IS THAT THE LOWER LEVEL PROCESSING PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPONENTS, WHICH MUST THEN BE GIVEN A ROBUST, CONSISTENT, SYMBOLIC/STRUCTURAL INTERPRETATION BY THE HIGHER LEVEL KNOWLEDGE-BASED COMPUTATION. CODE WILL BE IMPLEMENTED FOR A SUBSET OF THE KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION FOR WEATHER MAPS AND IMAGES. THE PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS IS HIGH BECAUSE THE INVESTIGATORS HAVE CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE IN DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING SYSTEMS IN WHICH HIGHER LEVEL KNOWLEDGE INTERACTS WITH LOWER LEVEL PROCESSING IN PATTERN AND IMAGE ANALYSIS.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE DETAILED CHARACTERIZATION OF INTERFACES BETWEEN ESSENTIALLY HOMOGENEOUS MATERIALS IS IMPORTANT FOR CT NDE OF SOLID ROCKET NOZZLES AND RELATED COMPONENTS. SPEED AND IMAGE SIZE LIMITATIONS OF CURRENT CT IMAGING AND IMAGE EVALUATION HARDWARE LEAVE SUCH FEATURES UNDER-RESOLVED. THIS RESULTS IN UNACCEPTABLE AMBIGUITY AT BOTH THE SINGLE-PIXEL AND MULTIPLE-PIXEL LEVELS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP ALGORITHMS WHICH UTILIZE A PRIORI INFORMATION ABOUT THE CT SYSTEM AND ABOUT THE OBJECT BEING IMAGED TO ACHIEVE SUPER-RESOLVED ESTIMATES OF NOZZLE CT INTERFACE GEOMETRY. IN THIS PHASE I PROJECT, ADAPTATION OF THEORY AND ALGORITHMS DEVELOPED FOR THE MANUAL AND AUTOMATIC DETECTION OF INTERFACE ANOMALIES IN SOLID ROCKET MOTORS WILL BE INVESTIGATED. THE PROJECT WILL INCLUDE (1) AN INITIAL REVIEW OF PERTINENT WORK TO DATE, (2) AN ANALYSIS OF NOZZLE CT DATA MEASURED BY THE ADVANCED ROCKET NOZZLE INSPECTION SYSTEM (ARNIS) TO ASCERTAIN ITS UNIQUE MEASUREMENT SYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS, (3) AN EXAMINATION OF TYPICAL NOZZLE DESIGN TOLERANCES TO VALIDATE ASSUMPTIONS MADE BY THE PROPOSED ANALYSIS ALGORITHMS, (4) DEMONSTRATION OF THESE ALGORITHMS USING BOTH SYNTHETIC AND MEASURED NOZZLE CT DATA, AND (5) A DETAILED PLAN FOR PHASE II FOLLOWUP.",
