COMMERCIALLY AVAILABEL FILAMENT WINDING MACHINES ARE EXPENSIVE AND LIMITE-SYMMETRIC FAMILIES OF SHAPES. THEY REQUIRE THE MANDREL (WRAPPING FORM) TO ROTATE AS A MEANS OF DISPENSING THE FILAMENT. AN EFFICIENT, COST-EFFECTIVE WAY TOWIND COMPLEX SHAPES IS TO MOUNT THE FORM TO A BASE AND USE A ROBOTIC MANIPULATOR IN INDEX A WINDING MECHANISM, IN A PRESCRIBED PATTERN, AROUND THE FORM. THE PROGRAM OBJECTIVES ARE: (1) TO CREATE A ROBOT FILAMENT WINDING WORKCELL, INCORPORATING AN INTELLIGENT WINDING MECHANISM AND ASSOCIATED C CONTROLLER; (2) DEVELOP SOFTWARE TO WIND GENERIC SHAPES USING ALGORITHMS THAT MAP THREE-DIMENSIONAL CURVE FUNCTIONS INTO TWO DIMENSIONS AND ROBOTIC INDEXING MOTIONS: AND (3) TO DEMONSTRATE THE PROCESS TO NSF REPRESENTATIVES. THIS PROGRAM WILL ALLOW THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR TO USE PROPRIETARY HARDWARE TO DEVELOP ROBOTIC WINDING OF COMPLEX SHAPED STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS. THIS SPECIFIC PROPOSAL WILL ESTABLISH THE CAPABILITY OF ROBOTIC WINDING IN A PRACTICAL APPLICATION. FUTURE RESEARCH EFFORTS WILL BUILD ON THE FOUNDATION ACHIEVED IN THIS PROGRAM AND CREATE A GENERIC WINDING SYSTEM FOR 3 DIMENSIONAL COMPLEX SHAPES, AT A SIGN ICANTLY LESS THAN CURRENT WINDING SYSTEMS. THE POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION AS DESCRIBED BY THE AWARDEE: THE AEROSPACE, AIRCRAFT, AND AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY ARE AMONG KEY AMERICAN INDUSTRIES SEEKING INNOVATIVE WAYS TO USE STRONG, LIGHTWEIGHT COMPOSITE MATERIALS. ALSO INCLUDED WOULD BE THE CORROSION RESISTANT PRODUCTS MARKET AND ENTIRE PLASTICS INDUSTRY. DEVELOPMENT OF SUCCESSFUL APPLICATIONS WILL DEFRAYMATERIAL AND MANUFACTURING COSTS, IMPROVE PRODUCT PERFORMANCE, AND HELP THE US MAINTAIN A COMPETITIVE EDGE.",

EXISTING ASSAYS FOR BREAST CANCER CELLS CANNOT DETERMINE METHOTREXATE SENSITIVITY BECAUSE OF REQUIREMENTS FOR FEEDER LAYERS AND MEDIUM COMPONENTS WHICH CAN RESCUE SENSITIVE CELLS. THIS PROPOSAL WILL EVALUATE TWO DIFFERENT APPROACHES: 1.IMPROVE AN EXISTING CLONOGENIC ASSAY BY MANIPULATING A SERUM-FREE MEDIUM BASED UPON MCDB 170 SO THAT METHOTREXATE TOXICITY IS ACHIEVED, AND 2.DEVELOP A TOTALLY DIFFERENT ASSAY FOR METHOTREXATE RESISTANCE WHICH MEASURES UPTAKE OF FLUORESCEIN-CONJUGATED DRUG USING A FLUORESCENCE ACTIVATED CELL SORTER (FACS). THE LATTER ASSAY DOES NOT REQUIRE CLONAL GROWTH. PHASE I WILL ESTABLISH THE NECESSARY MEDIUM FORMULATION FOR THE CLONAL ASSAY AND SHOW THAT METHOTREXATE DOSE RESPONSE CURVES ARE FEASIBLE FOR NORMAL AND TUMOR-DERIVED EPITHELIAL CELLS. ADDITIONALLY, PHASE I WILL CONTINUE THE FACS STUDIES AND EXPAND POTENTIAL SOURCES OF CLINICAL MATERIAL AND CORRELATIONS SO THAT DURING PHASE II BOTH ASSAYS MAY BE CONTINUED AND EVALUATED FOR EFFICACY AND PRACTICALITY. THE ASSAYS DEVELOPED IN PHASE I WILL PROVIDE A MEANS TO ISOLATE METHOTREXATE-RESISTANT CELLS WHOSE MECHANISMS OF RESISTANCE WILL BE EXAMINED DURING PHASE II. THUS, THESE IN VITRO ASSAYS WILL NOT ONLY BE USEFUL FOR PREDICTIVE PATIENT SENSITIVITY TESTING, BUT SHOULD ALSO PROVIDE A BASIS FOR IMPROVED DRUG DESIGN.",

TO EVALUATE THE USEFULNESS OF LIGHT EMISSION AS A SIGNAL IN IMMUNOLOGICAL AND DNA HYBRIDIZATION ASSAYS, THE LUCIFERASE PROTEIN FROM A MARINE CRUSTACEAN WILL BE CONJUGATED TO ANTIBODY AND OLIGONUCLEOTIDE DNA. USE OF LUCIFERASE WOULD AVOID THE HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH RADIOISOTOPES, AND LIGHT PRODUCTION IS CONVENIENT TO MEASURE. THE PROBE SIGNAL CAN BE GREATLY AMPLIFIED IN COMPARISON TO RADIOISOTOPE DECAY SINCE LIGHT IS THE PRODUCT OF AN ENZYMATIC REACTION. IN PHASE I, METHODS TO COVALENTLY LINK LUCIFERASE TO PROTEIN AND DNA WILL BE EVALUATED, AND SEVERAL PROTOTYPIC ASSAYS INCORPORATING LUCIFERASE CONJUGATES WILL BE DESIGNED. SHOULD A LUCIFERASE PROBE PROVE TO GENERATE A SIGNAL WHICH IS SUPERIOR IN TERMS OF SIMPLICITY AND SENSITIVITY OF DETECTION, WORK IN PHASE II WOULD PROCEED TO PERFECTING PRACTICAL ASSAYS AND TO CLONING, EXPRESSING, AND PURIFYING THE LUCIFERASE IN A RECOMBINANT ORGANISM FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROVIDING AN ABUNDANT SUPPLY OF THIS PROTEIN.",

CRUCIAL TO THE SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT OF THIS DISEASE IS EARLY DETECTION AS WELL AS CAREFUL MONITORING OF THE PROGRESS OF THE PERIODONTAL THERAPY. THERE ARE, HOWEVER, FEW EFFECTIVE APPROACHES TO THIS PROBLEM AND, FOR THE PRESENT, PERIODONTISTS MUST STILL RELY VERY HEAVILY ON DENTAL X-RAYS. UNFORTUNATELY, WHILE X-RAYS PROVIDE AN EXCELLENT WAY TO DIAGNOSE DENTAL CARIES, THE QUALITY OF RADIOGRAPHS IS NOT CONSISTENTLY HIGH ENOUGH TO OBTAIN RELIABLE DATA FOR STUDYING THE AVEOLAR BONE LOSS WHICH ACCOMPANIES PERIODONTAL DISEASE. THE CONTROL OF EXPOSURE IS MUCH MORE CRITICAL IN X-RAYS USED FOR PERIODONTAL EXAMINATION THAN FOR THOSE USED IN BASIC DENTISTRY BECAUSE THE DETECTION OF THE BOUNDARY OF THE ALVEOLAR BONE REQUIRES OPTIMUM CONTRAST. RADIOGRAPHIC MONITORING OF CHRONIC DESTRUCTIVE PERIODONTAL DISEASE IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE ABILITY OF THE CLINICIAN TO COMPARE SEQUENTIAL RADIOGRAPHS. ALTHOUGH SEVERAL FACTORS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE VARIABILITY OF THE QUALITY OF RADIOGRAPHS, THE MOST IMPORTANT CAUSE IS POOR CONTROL OF FILM EXPOSURE. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO CONDUCT THE DETECTOR AND INSTRUMENTATION RESEARCH NEEDED TO MAKE AN AUTOMATIC X-RAY EXPOSURE CONTROLLER FOR USE IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF PERIODONTAL DISEASE. DURING PHASE I, WE WILL FOCUS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE X-RAY SENSOR AND DEMONSTRATE THAT IT IS FEASIBLE TO USE SUCH A DEVICE FOR THIS PURPOSE. IN PHASE II OF THE PROGRAM, THE DETECTOR RESEARCH WILL BE COMPLETED AND A FULLY OPERATIONAL, EXPERIMENTAL PROTOTYPE SYSTEM WILL BE CONSTRUCTED AND TESTED WITH CLINICAL PHANTOMS IN COLLABORATION WITH THE HARVARD SCHOOL",

IT IS BECOMING AN IMPORTANT FUNDAMENTAL TOOL FOR BOTH CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND MEDICAL RESEARCH. THE HEART OF THIS INSTRUMENT IS A LARGE ARRAY OF NUCLEAR DETECTORS MOSTLY CONSISTING OF SCINTILLATOR CRYSTALS COUPLED TO PHOTOMULTIPLIER TUBES. THE COMPLEXITY, COST, AND DIFFICULTY OF BUILDING AN INSTRUMENT WITH HUNDREDS OF THESE BULKY AND FAGILE PHOTOSENSORS IS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM. THE AVAILABILITY OF A SUITABLE SEMICONDUCTOR SENSOR TO REPLACE THE PHOTOTUBES AND SCINTILLATOR CRYSTALS WOULD BE A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH IN THE DESIGN OF POSITRON TOMOGRAPHY CAMERAS. THIS WOULD GREATLY REDUCE THE COST AND INCREASE THE PRACTICALITY OF PET CAMERAS. IT HAS LONG BEEN RECOGNIZED THAT DETECTORS MADE FROM THE SEMICONDUCTOR CADMIUM TELLURIDE (CDTE) ARE THEORETICALLY THE BEST CANDIDATES FOR USE AS A SEMICONDUCTOR SENSOR FOR PET CAMERAS. PREVIOUSLY, THIS TYPE OF DETECTOR WAS LIMITED BY BOTH SMALL ACTIVE VOLUMES AND THE INABILITY TO PROVIDE THE FAST RESPONSE NEEDED FOR THIS APPLICATION. A NEW CDTE DIODE STRUCTURE HAS RECENTLY BEEN STUDIED. AS A RESULT, SEVERAL OF THE PREVIOUS LIMITATIONS OF CDTE APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN OVER- COME. IT SHOULD NOW BE POSSIBLE TO MAKE FAST EFFICIENT CDTE SENSORS WITH THE CORRECT SIZE, SHAPE, AND SPEED OF RESPONSE FOR THIS IMPORTANT MEDICAL INSTRUMENT. THUS, THE PLANNED PROGRAM IS DIRECTED AT INVESTIGATING THE POSSIBILITY OF USING THIS NEW CDTE DETECTOR DESIGN FOR PET APPLICATIONS. STUDIES WILL BE DONE WITH RESPECT TO SENSITIVITY AND TIME RESPONSE TO POSITRONS AS WELL AS WITH OTHER DETECTOR PARAMETERS RELEVANT TO PET IMAGING. BY THE END OF PHASE I, THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS DETECTOR DESIGN FOR PET SCANNING SHOULD BE DEMON- STRATED.",

IT INVOLVES AN ANALYTICAL EFFORT AT ALPHATECH, AND AN EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT. PILOT MODELING TECHNIQUES ARE CENTRAL TO OUR APPROACH FOR DISPLAY SYSTEM EVALUATION. A PILOT MODELING IS NEEDED TO GIVE PREDICTION OF CLOSED-LOOP PILOT/VEHICLE PERFORMANCE FOR A GIVEN WORKLOAD, AN TO RANK-ORDER THE USEFULNESS OF THE DISPLAYEDINFORMATION. OUR APPROACH, IN THE EVALUATION PROBLEM, IS TO EMPLOY THE OPTIMAL CONTROL MODEL (OCM) OF HUMAN RESPONSE. THE OCM COMPUTERBASED DISPLAY DESIGN PROCEDURE IS COMPRISED OF THREE LEVELS FOLLOWED BY MAN-IN-THE-LOOP EXPERIMENTATION. THESE LEVELS ARE: (1) INFORMATION LEVEL WHICH DETERMINES THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE SYSTEM VARIABLES IN THE PILOT VEHICLE-CONTROL TASK, (2) ELEMENT LEVEL IN WHICH THE INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS ARE INTEGRATED IN A FEASIBLE DISPLAY SYSTEM, AND (3) FORMAT LEVEL IN WHICH ACTUAL DISPLAY LAYOUT IS CONSTRUCTED.",

PRESENT METHODS, USING EITHER AUTOCLAVING OR FILTRATION OF SOLUBILIZED POWDER, ALSO HAVE SERIOUS DISADVANTAGES, SUCH AS HEAT LABILITY OF CERTAIN COMPONENTS, AND FILTER MEMBRANE FAILURE. CHEMICAL STERILANTS HAVE ALSO PROVEN UNSATISFACTORY. PHASE I FUNDS ARE SOUGHT TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF RENDERING THESE POWDERS STERILE. THESE MEDIA, WHICH WOULD BE PACKAGED IN A UNIQUELY CONSTRUCTED, LIGHT-WEIGHT CONTAINER, WOULD BE STABLE FOR SEVERAL YEARS OVER A WIDE TEMPERATURE RANGE. INITIAL STUDIES WOULD INCLUDE STERILIZATION METHODOLOGY, MICROBIAL EVALUATION, CONTAINER DEVELOPMENT, AND PERFORMANCE TESTING OF THE MEDIA. ENTHUSIASTIC RESPONSE TO THIS CONCEPT HAS BEEN RECEIVED FROM COMMERCIAL INTERESTS, BOTH DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN, WITH PARTICULAR POTENTIAL SEEN FOR FOREIGN TRADE.",

THE SECTION OF THE TELESCOPE UNDER INVESTIGATION IS ITS APERTURE WHICH IS CONSISTED OF FOUR INDIVIDUAL (90-DEGREE) SEGMENTS. THE REFLECTING SURFACES (0.005 INCH THIN POLISHED--NAME PLATE FINISH--ALUMINUM--TYPE1145), OCCUPY THE TELESCOPE APERTURE, ARE PLACED CONCENTRICALLY WITH AN AVERAGE SPACING OF 1/16 OF AN INCH.

COMPLEXES OF METALS OTHER THAN PLATINUM HAVE BEEN OFTEN POORLY DESIGNED BECAUSE THEY WERE MODELED AFTER THE ACTIVE PLATINUM COMPLEXES WITHOUT CONSIDERING THEIR DIFFERENT THERMODYNAMIC AND KINETIC PARAMETERS. IN PARTICULAR, PALLADIUM ANALOGS OF ACTIVE PLATINUM COMPLEXES HAVE EXHIBITED MARGINAL ACTIVITY BECAUSE OF THEIR SUBSTITUTION LABILITY. BY DECREASING THIS LABILITY, THIS INVESTIGATOR HAS DEVELOPED PALLADIUM COMPLEXES EXHIBITING ANTINEOPLASTIC ACTIVITY IN VIVO. IT IS THE OBJECT OF THIS PROJECT TO FULLY CHARACTERIZE THE INTERRELATIONSHIP AMONG PALLADIUM COMPLEX STABILITY, LIGAND BASICITY, AND ANTITUMOR ACTIVITY OF PALLADIUM COMPLEXES TOWARD THE DESIGN OF MORE ACTIVE COMPLEXES. TO DETERMINE IF ENHANCING STABILITY WILL INCREASE EFFECTIVENESS, THIS INVESTIGATOR WILL SYNTHESIZE PALLADIUM COMPLEXES WITH LIGANDS OF VARYING BASICITY. AROMATIC LIGANDS WILL BE STUDIED AND THEIR BASICITY WILL BE VARIED BY ELECTRON-DONATING SUBSTITUENTS. THE EFFECT OF BASICITY OF ALIPHATIC CARBOXYLIC ACID LIGANDS ON THE STABILITY OF PD-0 BOND WILL ALSO BE INVESTIGATED. IT IS EXPECTED THAT ENHANCEMENT IN STABILITY OF PALLADIUM COMPLEXES WILL BE OBSERVED WITH INCREASED INDUCTIVE RELEASE OF ELECTRONS BY THE LIGANDS.",

THESE USES OFTEN REQUIRE THAT THE RELATIVISTIC ELECTRONS BE HEATED EFFICIENTLY IN THE PRESENCE OF A DENSE, LOW-TEMPERATURE BACKGROUND PLASMA, AND THAT THE SPATIAL LOCATION AND EXTENT BE CONTROLLED OVER A SIGNIFICANT RANGE. HERE, A NEW APPROACH WILL BE ATTEMPTED FOR ACHIEVING EFFICIENT PREFERENTIAL HEATING OF MILDLY RELATIVISTIC ELECTRONS USING UPPER-OFF-RESONANT POWER INJECTED INTO HIGH-Q STRUCTURES MAINLY IN THE FORM OF ORDINARY MODES. THE ABSORPTION OF THIS POWER CAN BE INTERPRETED IN TERMS OF MODE CONVERSION INTO ELECTRON CYCLOTRON WAVES IN THE ANISOTROPIC, MIRROR CONFINED PLASMA. IN ADDITION, IT IS PLANNED TO USE MULTI-RESONANT ECH POWER TO BREAK UP COHERENT LIMIT CYCLES THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE INHIBIT THE STOCHASTIC HEATING OF MILDLY- RELATIVISTIC ELECTRONS.

THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO DETERMINE OPTIMAL COMPOSITIONS AND CONFIGURATIONS OF SHIELD COMPONENTS FOR THE PRO- TECTION OF SPACE SYSTEMS AGAINST MIXED RADIATION FIELDS FROM INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SOURCES. PARTICULAR ATTENTION WILL BE PAID TO USING COMPOSITE AND LAYERED SHIELD ELEMENTS AND TO INCORPORATING STREAMING PATHS IN THE SHIELD TO DIVERT RADIATION AWAY FROM CRITICAL AREAS SUCH AS MICROELECTRONIC COMPONENTS. SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL SAVINGS (REDUCED MASS FOR A SPECIFIED TARGET DOSE) ARE POSSIBLE. THE TECHNIQUES TO BE STUDIED ARE THE INVERSE MONTE CARLO METHOD AND THE BACK-PROJECTION ANGULAR FLUX ESTIMATOR. THESE ARE POWERFUL METHODS THAT HAVE BEEN RECENTLY DEVELOPED AND APPLIED TO SIMPLE PRO- BLEMS IN OTHER FIELDS. INVERSE MONTE CARLO IS A NON- ITERATIVE METHOD FOR SOLVING INVERSE AND OPTIMIZA- TION PROBLEMS, AND THE BACK-PROJECTION ESTIMATOR IS A DIRECT WAY TO OBTAIN ANGULAR FLUX IN A UNIQUE DIREC- TION AT A POINT, WITHOUT THE USE OF FINITE SPATIAL AND ANGULAR INTERVALS. THE INTENT OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DE- TERMINE IF THE METHODS ARE CAPABLE OF BEING USED TO FIND OPTIMUM COMPOSITION AND PLACEMENT OF SHIELD ELEMENTS FOR MIXED-FIELD SHIELDING IN COMPLEX GEOM- ETRIES.

THE HOLES IN THE OXIDE WILL SERVE AS NUCLEATION CENTERS LEADING TO SINGLE CRYSTAL GROWTH. LATERAL OVER-GROWTH OF THE OXIDE CAN BE ENHANCED BY CHOOSING THE PROPER SUBSTRATE ORIENTATION, I.E. <111>. DIRECT CONTACT BETWEEN THE SILICONAND THE GAAS WILL BE LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF THE AREA WHICHWILL LIMIT STRAIN AND DISLOCATION PROPAGATION THROUGH THE GROWN GAAS FILM.",

TRADITIONAL CONVOLUTIONAL (SEQUENTIAL) DECODING TECHNIQUES CAN PROVIDE ARBITRARILY LOW OUTPUT ERROR RATES WITH A LONG CONSTRAINT LENGTH CODE. HOWEVER, BURSTS OF NOISE OR FADES CAN OVERBURDEN THE DECODER, AS INCOMING DATA OVERFLOW THE DECODERS (FINITE) BUFFER MEMORY. A SHORTER CONSTRAINT LENGTH CODE CAN BE USED TO ENABLE THE DECODER TO COMPUTE THROUGH NOISE BURSTS, BUT THE PENALTY IS A HIGHER RATE OF UNDETECTED OUTPUT ERROR. ANOTHER CONSIDERATION OF LONG CONSTRAINT LENGTH CODES IS THAT \"GOOD\"CODES ARE NOT SYSTEMATIC; NO CODED BITS CONTAIN CLEAR INFORMATION BITS. AS A RESULT, THESE CODES ARE NOT SELF-SYNCHRONIZING. THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUE FOR IMBEDDING A SHORT CONSTRAINT LENGTH CODE, USING OPTIMIZED MODULATION, PROMISES TO MITIGATE BOTH PROBLEMS OF LONG CONSTRAINT LENGTH SEQUENTIAL DECODING.THIS IS EFFECTED BY SPACING THE MODULATED SIGNAL VECTORS REPRESENTING THE SHORT CODE RELATIVELY FAR APART, WHILE THE SIGNAL VECTORS REPRESENTING THE LONG CODE ARE CLOSE TOGETHER.

WOUND DRESSING MATERIALS IN USE TODAY (EXAMPLE: GAUZE) CAN BE TREATED WITH AN INSOLUBLE, ANTIBIOTIC-CONTAINING, HYALURONIC ACID (HA) COATING TO PROVIDE A PERMEABLE, NONADHESIVE (CLOTTED BLOOD-WET OR DRYWILL NOT BIND TO THIS SURFACE) BARRIER TO THE ENVIRONMENT. THIS HYDROPHILIC COATING WOULD DECREASE DEHYDRATION OF THE WOUND WHILE ALLOWING DIFFUSION OF LOW MOLECULAR WEIGHT METABOLITES OUT OF THE WOUND, THEREBY REDUCING PAIN, SWELLING, AND THE NUMBER OF TIMES THE DRESSING MUST BE CHANGED. THIS HA COATING WOULD ALSO RESTRICT THE TRAFFIC OF BATERIA INTO THE WOUND WHILE THE ANTIBIOTIC PRESENT WOULD DIMINISH THE POSSIBILITY OF INFECTION DUE TO GROWTH OF BACTERIA ALREADY INHABITING THE WOUND SITE. A DRESSING OF THIS TYPE WOULD BE EXPECTED TO PROMOTE HEALING OF THE WOUND BY PROVIDING A FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT (MOIST, WARM, NON-INFECTED, ABSENCE OF TISSUE REACTION) FOR CELLS TO GROW IN AND TO MIGRATE OVER THE WOUND SURFACE. PROCEDURES FOR ASSESSING THE EFFICACY OF THIS TYPE OF WOUND DRESSING ARE DESCRIBED IN THIS PROPOSAL.",

AT PRESENT THERE IS NO FDA-APPROVED SMALL VESSEL GRAFT OF 5MM OR SMALLER; SMALL DIAMETER (58MM) GRAFTS CURRENTLY IN USE (DACRON, EXPANDED POLYTETRAFLUOROETHYLENE (PTFE) TEFLON, AUTOLOGOUS SAPHENOUS VEIN, UMBILICAL VEIN BIOGRAFT) GENERALLY PERFORM POORLY. HYALURONIC ACID IS A NATURAL BIOPOLYMER AND AN UBIQUITOUS GLYCOSAMINOGLYCAN COMPONENT OF THE INTERCELLULAR MATRIX. THE EXTRAORDINARY TISSUE COMPATIBILITY OF SOLUBLE HYALURONIC ACID IS WELL DOCUMENTED. IN PHASE I OF THIS PROPOSED PROGRAM, INSOLUBLE HYALURONIC ACID COATINGS WILL BE STUDIED IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THEIR EFFECTIVENESS AS BIOLOGICAL INTERFACES WHICH ARE NONTHROMBOGENIC AND WHICH PROMOTE NORMAL HEALING (ENDOTHELIALIZATION). EXTENSIVE IN VITRO ENDOTHELIALIZATION TESTS IN TISSUE CULTURE INDICATE THAT, FOLLOWING TREATMENT WITH HYALURONIC ACID-CONTAINING MATERIAL, SYNTHETIC BIOMEDICAL POLYMERS, WHICH ORDINARILY WOULD NOT SUPPORT CELL GROWTH, NOW HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROMOTE APPARENTLY NORMAL ENDOTHELIAL CELL ATTACHMENT AND PROLIFERATION. RESULTS FROM PRELIMINARY IN VITRO TESTS OF BLOOD COMPATIBILITY (PARTIAL THROMBOPLASTIN TIMES, FACTOR XII ACTIVATION) STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT HYALURONIC ACID IS A SUPERIOR BLOOD COMPATIBLE MATERIAL. IN THESE TESTS, HYALURONIC ACID WAS COMPARED WITH OTHER WIDELY USED BLOOD CONTACTING MATERIALS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PHASE I PROGRAM IS TO DEMONSTRATE MORE COMPLETELY THE UNIQUE BIOLOGICAL COMPATIBILITY OF HYALURONIC ACID AND ITS POTENTIAL FOR USE IN A SMALL DIAMETER VASCULAR GRAFT.",

BECAUSE OF THE EXCELLENT RECORDS OF SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF THESE TWO PRODUCTS, IT IS SAFE TO ASSUME THAT, IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, THE COLD ETHANOL PROCEDURE WILL REMAIN AS THE METHOD OF CHOICE FOR MANUFACTURING THESE PLASMA DERIVATIVES. ANY NEW OR MODIFIED PROCEDURE TO ISOLATE THESE TWO IMPORTANT PLASMA DERIVATIVES WILL HAVE TO BE BUILT INTO THE EXISTING SCHEME OF THE ETHANOL FRACTIONATION. IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE THROUGH THE YEARS TO SHORTEN THE PROCESSING STEPS WITH COMPARABLE YIELD AND QUALITY OF THE PRODUCTS, BUT THE LIQUID-SOLID SEPARATION OF EVERY STEP IS STILL BEING DONE BY CENTRIFUGATION, WHICH IS LABOR INTENSIVE AS WELL AS COSTLY FOR MAINTENANCE, AND IS OFTEN THE BOTTLENECK OF THE ENTIRE PROCESS. THE ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH PROPOSAL IS TO ADDRESS THE SIMPLIFICATION OF THE PROCESS, AND THE INCREASE IN YIELD, BASED ON A SIMPLIFIED VERSION OF THE COLD ETHANOL PROCEDURE, TO PREPARE ALBUMIN AND IMMUNE GLOBULIN USING EXCLUSIVELY FILTRATION AND ULTRAFILTRATION TECHNIQUES. FILTRATION WILL BE ATTEMPTED TO REPLACE ALL THE EXISTING CENTRIFUGATION STEPS, AND ULTRAFILTRATION WILL BE ATTEMPTED TO REPLACE LYOPHILIZATION AND RECONSTITUTION TO PREPARE THE FINAL SOLUTIONS. PRELIMINARY RESULTS HAVE INDICATED THAT THIS SIMPLIFIED PROCESS WILL NOT ONLY RESULT IN A PREPARATION WHICH IS AT LEAST OF THE SAME QUALITY AS THAT OBTAINED BY THE CONVENTIONAL FRACTIONATION, BUT ALSO IMPROVE THE YIELD DUE TO FEWER FRACTIONATION STEPS. THIS WILL RESULT IN FEWER HANDLING LOSSES, AND THE ABILITY TO RECOVER THE MOTHER LIQUID WHICH IS OTHERWISE ENTRAPPED IN THE PRECIPITATE.",

LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS OF PBC IS CURRENTLY BASED UPON HISTOLOGICAL FINDINGS IN BIOPSY MATERIAL AND DETECTION OF SERUM ANTIMITOCHONDRIAL ANTIBODIES (AMA) BY IMMUNOFLUORESCENT STAINING OF UNFIXED TISSUE. AS CURRENTLY PERFORMED, NEITHER PROCEDURE CAN RELIABLY DIFFERENTIATE PBC FROM CHRONIC ACTIVE HEPATITIS OR OTHER AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS. SINCE AMA ARE PRESENT IN 99% OF PBC SERA AND IN A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE GENERAL POPULATION, THE USE OF AMA AS A DIAGNOSTIC CRITERION IS WARRANTED PROVIDED THAT APPROPRIATE LABORATORY TECHNIQUES ARE AVAILABLE. THEREFORE, IT IS PROPOSED THAT AN IMPROVED METHODOLOGY BE DEVELOPED FOR THE DETECTION OF SPECIFIC AMA WHICH ARE PRESENT IN PBC SERA BUT NOT IN CHRONIC LIVER DISEASES OR AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS. PRELIMINARY RESULTS HAVE IDENTIFIED A MITOCHONDRIAL ANTIGEN WHICH REACTS WITH 90% OF THE PBC SERA TESTED BY IMMUNO BLOT TRANSFER. CROSS-REACTIVITY WITH OTHER CHRONIC LIVER DISEASES WAS LESS THAN 10% UNDER APPROPRIATE ASSAY CONDITIONS.

TWO TYPES OF ALGORITHMS ARE PRESENTED WHICH WOULD BE APPLICABLE EITHER TO SPACECRAFT WHICH DETERMINE ATTITUDE FROM VECTOR SENSORS ALONE OR TO SPACECRAFT WHICH USE VECTOR SENSORS AND THREE-AXIS GYROS. THE APPROACH IS BASES ON MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION, WHICH IS A WELL-ESTABLISHED PARAMETER ESTIMATION TECHNIQUE, AND USES A REALISTIC PROBABLISTIC MODEL FOR SENSOR MEASUREMENT ERRORS. A SUFFICIENT STATISTIC IS USED TO PROVIDE COMMANALITY BETWEEN THE TOW ALGORITHM TYPES, TO GREATLY REDUCE THE COMPUTATIONAL BURDEN,AND TO ALLOW OPTIONAL SUBOPTIMAL MISALIGNMENT ESTIMATES (WHICH PROVIDE USEFUL DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION) TO BE CALCULATED WITHOUT REPROCESSING THE DATA. REDUNDANCY AND CORRELATIONS BETWEEN DERIVED MEASUREMENTS ARE TREATED EXACTLY SO THAT IT BECOMES POSSIBLETO CALCULATE CONFIDENCE BOUNDS CORRECTLY, PERHAPS FOR THE FIRST TIME. THIS ANALYSIS LEADS TO AN EXTREMELY EFFICIENT, FLEXIBLE, MODULAR AND USER-FRIENDLY SOFTWARE PACKAGE WHICH YIELDS THE BEST POSSIBLE ESTIMATE OF THE MISALIGNMENTS AND IS FAST ENOUGH TO BE USED INTERACTIVELY OR EVEN BE IMPLEMENTED ON AN ONBOARD COMPUTER.",

A CRITICAL COMPONENT NEEDED FOR SUCH VECTORS IS A DNA SEQUENCE CODING FOR A SECRETION SIGNAL RECOGNIZED BY YEAST. THE GENE FOR THE SECRETED K2 KILLER TOXIN OF S. CEREVISIAE WILL BE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE IF PORTIONS OF THIS GENE CAN BE USED AS THE SECRETION SIGNAL IN THE VECTORS. CDNA CLONES DERIVED FROM THE DOUBLE-STRANDED RNA RESPONSIBLE FOR K2 TOXIN PRODUCTION WILL BE ANALYZED BY SEQUENCING AND BY EXPRESSION IN YEAST CELLS TO IDENTIFY CLONES THAT CODE FOR THE TOXIN PROTEIN. TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE TOXIN SEQUENCES WILL DIRECT THE SECRETION OF HETEROLOGOUS PRODUCTS, VARIOUS FRAGMENTS OF THE TOXIN CDNAS WILL THEN BE FUSED WITH MAMMALIAN GENES, PLACED INTO YEAST EXPRESSION VECTORS, AND TRANSFORMED INTO YEAST CELLS TO ASSAY FOR EXPRESSION AND SECRETION OF THE FOREIGN PROTEINS. IF SECRETION IS DETECTED, THEN A SECOND PHASE OF THE PROJECT WILL BEGIN. THIS PHASE WILL PRIMARILY INVOLVE A MORE DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE TOXIN GENE, IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE THE TOXIN ELEMENTS INCORPORATED INTO THE VECTORS.",

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO SYNTHESIZE THE DEUTERATED ANALOGS OF A NUMBER OF THE MOST PROMISING NEW MATERIALS - INCLUDING PBT, PBO, AND BBB POLYMERS. THE ADVANTAGE OF INCORPORATING DEUTERIUM INTO THESE POLYMERS IS TO GREATLY INCREASE THE THERMAL OXIDATIVE STABILITY OF THE MATERIALS WITHOUT CHANGING ANY OF THE BENEFICIAL PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE POLYMERS THEMSELVES. THE APPROACH WILL BE TO MAKE THE DEUTERATED PRODUCTS BY FIRST PREPARING THE ISOTOPE LABELED STARTING MATERIALS OR INTERMEDIATE MONOMERS, AND THEN REACTING THESE TO FORM THE DESIRED POLYMERS. ATTEMPTS WILL ALSO BE MADE TO EXCHANGE THE POLYMERS DIRECTLY TO INVESTIGATE POSSIBLE DIRECT, LOW COST METHODS OF PREPARATION.

NEITHER OF THESE MATERIALS HAS PROVIDED THE ANSWER FOR VASCULAR REPLACEMENT OF VESSELS OF LESS THAN 6MM. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO TRANSFER TECHNOLOGY ON VASCULAR PROSTHESES MADE FROM A SEGMENTED POLYETHER POLYURETHANE THAT HAS UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT ENABLE THESE PROSTHESES TO STRETCH AND PULSATE LIKE NORMAL VESSELS. NO MATERIAL CURRENTLY IN USE IS CAPABLE OF DOING THIS. SUCH A SYSTEM WOULD PROVIDE FOR MARKED IMPROVEMENT IN LIFE EXPECTANCY AS WELL AS THE QUALITY OF PATIENT'S LIFE WITH BOTH OCCLUSIVE AND ANEURYSMAL VASCULAR DISEASES. THE MAJOR ELEMENTS OF THIS PROSTHESIS WILL BE ITS HIGH COMPLIANCE, FLEXIBILITY AND DURABILITY, MINIMAL POROSITY, AND A GRAFT THAT IS TOTALLY NONREACTIVE WITH BLOOD AND VASCULAR TISSUES. THE ULTIMATE AIM OF THIS STUDY WILL BE TO FABRICATE AN ARTERIAL REPLACEMENT THAT BECOMES FUNCTIONALLY INTEGRATED INTO THE BODY. IT WILL BE ABLE TO FUNCTION AS A BLOOD CONDUIT AND MAINTAIN ITS PATENCY INDEFINITELY. ANASTOMOTIC CONNECTIONS WILL BE DEVELOPED AND INCORPORATED INTO THE ENDS OF THE PROSTHESIS TO PERMIT A SMOOTH TRANSITION FROM THE CUT END OF THE NATURAL VESSEL TO THE SYNTHETIC PROSTHESIS. THIS WILL PROVIDE A SMOOTH, LEAK-FREE ANASTOMOTIC JUNCTION, REDUCE INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION, AND ELIMINATE NEOINTIMAL HYPERPLASIA FOR INCREASED SHORT-TERM SURVIVAL AND LONG-TERM PATENCY. EXTENSIVE PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL, AND ANIMAL TESTING OF THE POLYMERS AND PROSTHESES WILL BE DONE IN ORDER TO ASSURE COMPATIBILITY WITH THE HOST TISSUES. IN VITRO TESTING OF VESSELS WILL BE DIRECTED PRIMARILY TOWARDS STRENGTH, DURABILITY, FLEXIBILITY, AND COMPLIANCE IN TEST APPARATUSES WHICH ARE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO SEVERELY STRESS CANDIDATE PROSTHESES. ONCE THE DESIGNS AND FABRICATION PROCESSES HAVE BEEN PROVEN, ANIMAL TESTING OF PROTOTYPE UNITS WILL BEGIN. (ANIMAL MODEL TESTING OF PRODUCTION UNITS WILL BE PERFORMED IN PHASE II OF THE PROJECT.) PROSTHESES WILL BE IMPLANTED IN CAROTID ARTERIES OF SHEEP AND GOATS IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THROMBORESISTANCE, BLOOD AND TISSUE COMPATIBILITY, AND STABILITY OF THE ANASTOMOTIC CONNECTING MECHANISMS.",

A CRITICAL ASPECT OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE MAINTENANCE PROCESS IS THE INPUT FROM INSPECTIONS AND CONDITION SURVEYS OF THE LARGE STRUCTURES (E.G. DAMS, BRIDGES, ROADS) THAT CONSTITUTE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS. THE TRADITIONAL AND TIME HONORED TECHNIQUE OF VISUAL INSPECTION BY TRAINED INSPECTORS IS NO LONGER ADEQUATE TO MEET THIS NEW MAINTENANCE DEMAND. THIS IS DUE TO THE SIZE, EXTENT, AND INACCESSIBILITY OF THE STRUCTURES THEMSELVES, TOTHE MAGNITUDE OF THE MAINTENANCE NEED, AND TO THE LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF TRAINED INSPECTORS. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, THIS RESEARCH PROPOSES THE CONCEPT OF AUTOMATING THE ACQUISITION, ANALYSIS, AND INTERPRETATION OF VISUAL DATA USED FOR INSPECTING STRUCTURES. THE CONCEPT DRAWS ON TECHOLOGIES THAT HAVE BEEN WELL DEVELOPED IN THE FIELDS OF \"MACHINE VISION\", REMOTE SENSING, AND MEDICAL IMAGERY. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP A CONCEPT AND SPECIFICATION FOR A SYSTEM WHICH INTEGRATES VISUAL DATA ACQUISITION, DATA CONVERSION, VISUAL IMAGE PROCESSING, SYMBOLIC FEATURE DISCRIMINATION AND PATTERN RECOGNITION, AND KNOWLEDGE-BASED INTERPRETATION OF SYMBOLIC FEATURES AND PATTERNS. THIS OBJECTIVE WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH A SERIES OF SIMPLE BUT CRITICAL COMPUTATIONAL EXPERIMENTS CARRIED OUT ON PHOTOGRAPHIC DATA, UTILIZING STANDARD PROCESSING ALGORITHMS AND AVAILABLE SOFTWARE.",

PREVIOUS WORK ON TNF HAS SHOWN IT TO HAVE CYTOSTATIC OR CYTOLYTIC ACTIVITY IN VITRO AGAINST A NUMBER OF TRANSFORMED CELL LINES AND TO HAVE TUMOR NECROTIC ACTIVITY AGAINST VARIOUS TUMORS IN ANIMAL MODELS. MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT HAS NO ADVERSE EFFECT ON NORMAL CELLS EITHER IN CULTURE OR IN ANIMAL MODELS. THIS SPECIFICITY FOR TUMOR CELLS SUGGESTS A POTENTIAL VALUABLE THERAPEUTIC ROLE FOR TNF IN TREATING HUMAN TUMORS. IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH ITS VALUE, HOWEVER, SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES OF THIS RATHER RARE PROTEIN MUST BE ISOLATED FOR TESTING. THE OVERALL AIM OF THIS RESEARCH PROPOSAL IS TO PRODUCE TNF ECONOMICALLY IN LARGE QUANTITIES FROM YEAST CELLS.

A CDNA LIBRARY WILL BE CONSTRUCTED FROM HUMAN PANCREAS TISSUE. CLONING WILL BE INTO THE LAMBDA GT11 SYSTEM. CLONES CARRYING ISLET CELL ANTIGEN SEQUENCES WILL BE IDENTIFIED BY DIFFERENTIAL IMMUNOSCREENING WITH SERA FROM TYPE I DIABETES PATIENTS AND SERA FROM NORMAL INDIVIDUALS. WITH THE LAMBDA GT11 SYSTEM, CLONES CARRYING DIABETES-ASSOCIATED SEQUENCES CAN BE INDUCED TO EXPRESS SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF THE PANCREAS ANTIGEN FUSED TO BETA-GALACTOSIDASE (HYBRID PROTEIN). BECAUSE OF THEIR LARGE SIZE, THESE PROTEINS CAN SUBSEQUENTLY BE EASILY PURIFIED. THE GOAL OF THIS WORK IS TO CLONE, EXPRESS AND CHARACTERIZE ISLET CELL ANTIGEN GENES AND TO DEVELOP A SIMPLE TEST FOR ISLET CELL ANTIBODIES USING ANTIGENS PRODUCED BY RECOMBINANT DNA METHODS. THE USE OF RECOMBINANT DNA TECHNIQUES GIVES THIS METHODOLOGY THE POWER TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC DISEASE-ASSOCIATED EPITOPES. THIS WILL FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A",

THE POTENTIAL APPLICATION OF AQUEOUS, CRYSTAL CLEAR AND COLORLESS GELS OF PLURONIC POLYOL F-127R, A POLYOXYETHYLENE-POLYOXYPROPYLENE CO-BLOCK POLY- MER OF LOW TOXICITY, WILL BE STUDIED IN A TWO-PHASE PROGRAM FOR SUCH USE. THESE GELS EXHIBIT REVERSE THERMAL GELATION BEHAVIOR, GOOD SOLUBILIZATION CAPACITY, ARE EASY TO PREPARE AND ECONOMICAL IN COST. PHASE I STUDIES WILL BE DIRECTED TO CONFIRMING THE OCULAR COMPATIBILITY AND VITROUS REPLACEMENT FEASIBILITY OF THE GELS, EVALUATION AND OPTIMIZATION OF THE RELEASE OF ANTITUMOR DRUG, E.G., ACTINOMYCIN D, FROM THE GELS BASED ON IN VITRO RELEASE STUDIES AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROTOTYPE FORMULATIONS. PHASE II WILL CONSIST OF EXTENSIVE IN VIVO STUDIES OF THESE PROTOTYPE FORMULATIONS. SUCH A NOVEL APPROACH FOR COMBINING VITREOUS REPLACEMENT WITH DRUG DELIVERY MAY NOT ONLY ADVANCE INTRAOCULAR ANTITUMOR THERAPY, BUT SHOULD BE A SUITABLE VEHICLE AS WELL FOR OTHER THERAPEUTIC AGENTS INCLUDING ANTIBIOTICS.",

A SINGLE ULTRASONIC SENSOR IS SUFFICIENT TO MEASURE DISTANCES TO AN OBJECT. ADVANTAGES OF ULTRASONIC SENSOR ARE ITS LOW COST AND HIGH PRECISION OF SHORT RANGE MEASUREMENTS. EFFECTIVE USE OF ULTRASONIC SENSOR SYSTEMS WILL ALLOW INEXPENSIVE ROBOTS TO HANDLE IMPRECISELY POSITIONED PARTS, WELD, INSPECT, AND PERFORM FACTORY ASSEMBLY TASKS. WE PROPOSE TO BUILD AN ARRAY OF ULTRASONIC TRANSDUCERS, MOUNT IT ON THE WRIST OF A ROBOT, AND INTEGRATE IT WITH THE MANIPULATOR. THE ACOUSTIC BEAMS WILL BE ELECTRONICALLY STEERED AND FOCUSED. THE ELECTRONIC BEAM FOCUSING WILL IMPROVE THE ANGULAR RESOLUTION. A PARALLEL PROCESSING ARCHITECTURE IS PROPOSED TO PROCESS THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL IMAGES. COMPUTER INTEGRATION BETWEEN THE SENSOR ACQUIRED DATA AND THE MANIPULATOR JOINTS CONTROL INCLUDES MOTION-PATHPLANNING BLOCK AND COORDINATE TRANSFORMATION BLOCK.

USE OF THE OXYGEN-18 REACTION ROUTE TO FLUORINE-18 WILL HAVE TWO MAJOR BENEFITS: (1) ELIMINATION OF A REQUIREMENT FOR HANDLING TOXIC, HIGHLY REACTIVE FLUORINE GAS IN THE CONVENTIONAL TARGET SYSTEM; AND (2) A HIGHER YIELD OF FLUORINE-18 RESULTING IN SHORTER IRRADIATION TIMES (INCREASED PRODUCTION RATE, HIGHER STUDY THROUGHPUT).

THE NEW DETECTOR INCLUDES 32 BISMUTH GERMANATE (BGO) SCINTILLATION CRYSTALS MOUNTED ON A LIGHT GUIDE. THE LIGHT GUIDE PROVIDES A SQUARE ROOT SEPARATION OF THE LIGHT DISTRIBUTION FROM EACH CRYSTAL. THE LIGHT FROM THE LIGHT GUIDE IS DETECTED BY TWO DUAL HAMAMATSU PHOTOMULTIPLIER TUBES (R1548) THAT ARE ONE INCH SQUARE. THE SIGNAL FROM EACH PHOTOMULTIPLIER IS PROCESSED THROUGH THE ENCODING ELECTRONICS TO PRODUCE A DIGITAL SIGNAL INDICATING A SIGNAL POSITION (1 OUT OF 32) FOR EACH 511 KEV GAMMA RAY IMPINGING ON THE DETECTOR. THE DIMENSION OF EACH OF THE 32 CRYSTALS IS NOMINALLY 3 MILLIMETERS 12 30 MILLIMETERS. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE DETECTOR, INCLUDING CRYSTALS, LIGHT GUIDE, PHOTOMULTIPLIER AND ELECTRONICS FOR THE 32-CRYSTAL ARRAY, WILL COST $2,500 COMPARED TO THE ACTUAL COST OF $15,000 FOR 32 INDIVIDUAL CRYSTALS, PHOTOMULTIPLIERS, AND SETS OF ELECTRONICS. THE IMPROVED POSITION RESOLUTION ( 3 MM) WILL ALLOW PET TOMOGRAPHS TO OBTAIN THE THEORETICAL LIMIT IMPOSED BY THE MOMENTUM OF THE POSITRON.

THE OXYGEN-18 ROUTE HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF ELIMINATING THE REQUIREMENT FOR HANDLING TOXIC, HIGHLY REACTIVE FLUORINE GAS AND WILL PRODUCE A HIGHER YIELD OF FLUORINE-18. THE SYNTHETIC REQUIREMENT FOR AQUEOUS F18-FLUORIDE, FREE FROM INTERFERING CATIONS, DICTATES THE NEED TO EXAMINE 2 TARGET CHAMBER CONFIGURATIONS: AN OXYGEN GAS TARGET WHICH CAN BE RECYCLED AND AN OXYGEN-18 WATER TARGET WHICH IS EASILY TRANSPORTED FROM CYCLOTRON TO SYNTHESIS SITE.

THE PROGRAM STRUCTURE AND INPUTS FORM THE FOLLOWING INDEPENDENT VARIABLES: WORKLOAD VARIATION, WORKLOAD LEVEL, NURSING CARE STAFF AVAILABLE, WARD STRUCTURE, AND ONE OF FOUR POSSIBLE MASTER NURSE STAFFING PATTERNS. PROGRAM OUTPUTS (DEPENDENT VARIABLES) INCLUDE WAGE COSTS, FREQUENCY OF UNDERSTAFFING AND OVERSTAFFING, AND DEGREE OF UNDERSTAFFING AND OVERSTAFFING. THE PROGRAM WILL ALSO MEASURE THE NUMBER OF NURSES FLOATED INTO AND OUT OF EACH WARD FOR STAFFING SYSTEMS WHICH REQUIRE NURSES TO FLOAT AMONG WARDS. THE RESEARCH METHOD IS THE MATCHED SAMPLE POSTTEST-ONLY DESIGN. COMPUTER SIMULATION IS EMPLOYED TO ACHIEVE PERFECT MATCHING OF INDEPENDENT VARIABLES, AND CONTROL OF EXTRANEOUS VARIABLES. SMALL HOSPITAL (100 BEDS IN 4 WARDS) PILOT SIMULATIONS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED USING A MAINFRAME COMPUTER. PHASE I WILL DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF APPLYING THIS METHODOLOGY TO THE STUDY OF LARGER INSTITUTIONS (400 OR MORE BEDS), AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF USING MICROCOMPUTERS FOR THE COMMERCIAL APPLICATION. MAINFRAME COMPUTERS ARE NOT GENERALLY AVAILABLE TO NURSE MANAGERS. THEREFORE, PHASE II WILL REQUIRE A MAJOR REPROGRAMMING EFFORT SO THE SIMULATIONS CAN BE RUN ON A MICROCOMPUTER. THE FINAL PRODUCT WILL BE AN INNOVATIVE DECISION SUPPORT TOOL WHICH CAN BE MARKETED TO HOSPITALS, NURSING HOMES, AND OTHER MULTIWARD HEALTH CARE INSTITUTIONS.",

THE PRESENT PROPOSAL VIEWS THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS AS CONSISTING OF THREE POTENTIAL ROLES: PLANNER, CRITIC, AND ENGINEER, AND PROPOSES TO INVESTIGATE WHAT DEMANDS EACH TASK PLACES ON THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS. WE PROPOSE THAT THE ROLE OF PLANNER BIASES PEOPLE TOWARD CAUSAL REASONING AND WILL LEAD TO THE FOLLOWING THREE PHENOMENA: A) PEOPLE WILL BE DISPOSED TO USECAUSAL INFORMATION WHEN AVAILABLE AND THIS WILL GREATLY INCREASE THEIR CERTAINTY JUDGEMENTS; B) PEOPLE WILL PREFER SINGLE OPTION PLANS TO MULTIPLE OPTION PLANS LEADING TO THE DESIRED OUTCOME; AND C) PEOPLE WILL PREFER COMPLEX, MORE DETAILED PLANS TO SIMPLER, LESS DETAILED PLANS.

CK EXISTS PRIMARILY AS THREE ISOENZYMES: BB, WHICH IS PRESENT IN BRAIN; MB, WHICH PRIMARILY EXISTS IN HEART MUSCLE; AND MM, WHICH IS PRESENT BOTH IN HEART AND SKELETAL MUSCLES. CURRENT METHODS FOR MEASURING MB INCLUDE ELECTROPHORESIS, COLUMN CHROMATOGRAPHY, ENZYME INHIBITION, AND RADIOIMMUNOSSAY (RIA). ALTHOUGH THE ABOVE METHODS ARE USEFUL IN MEASURING MB IN SERUM, THERE ARE INHERENT LIMITATIONS IN THESE METHODS. ELECTROPHORESIS AND CHROMATOGRAPHY ARE NOT SENSITIVE, AND THUS PRECISE QUANTITATION OF MB AT THE LOWER LEVEL BECOMES DIFFICULT. ENZYME INHIBITION AND RIA METHODS, ALTHOUGH QUITE SENSITIVE, MAY NOT BE SPECIFIC ALL THE TIME BECAUSE THEY MEASURE B SUBUNIT OF BOTH MB AND BB AND ALSO CROSS-REACT WITH THE MACROMOLECULAR FORMS OF CK. THREE COMMERCIAL KITS ARE AVAILABLE WHICH MEASURE SPECIFIC MB ISOENZYME: TWO USE SOLID-PHASE SANDWICH IMMUNOASSAY TECHNIQUE AND THE OTHER USES A COMBINATION OF ENZYME INHIBITION AND PRECIPITATION METHODS. STABILITY OF THE COMPONENTS, CUMBERSOME METHODOLOGY, AND POOR SENSITIVITY POSE PROBLEMS IN THE FIRST METHOD; AND THE SECOND IS A VERY TIME-CONSUMING MANUAL METHOD WHOSE COMPLETE AUTOMATION IS DIFFICULT. FOR THESE REASONS DSL, IN COLLABORATION WITH THE UTHSC AT DALLAS, WILL DEVELOP AN ASSAY WHICH WILL SPECIFICALLY MEASURE CK-MB IN SERUM WITHOUT CROSS-REACTIVITY TO OTHER FORMS OF CK. THE PROPOSED METHOD IS TO PREPARE A MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY USING HYBRID CELL TECHNIQUES TO THE CHEMICALLY WELL-DEFINED PURE PROTEIN ANTIGEN, HUMAN HEART (H)CK-MB. SUCH MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY SHOULD BE MONOSPECIFIC IN TERMS OF BINDING TO A UNIQUE DETERMINANT ON THE IMMUNOGEN MOLECULE, CK-MB, AND NOT BE REACTIVE WITH OTHER FORMS OF CK.

ENERGY SELECTIVE X-RAY IMAGES CAN PROVIDE IMPROVED VISUALIZATION OF LESIONS THROUGH SELECTIVE TISSUE SUBTRACTION, AND IMPROVED DIAGNOSIS OF THESE LESIONS THROUGH TISSUE CHARACTERIZATION. SPECIFIC AIMS ARE TO USE COMPUTER SIMULATIONS TO DESIGN AN OPTIMAL ENERGY SELECTIVE DETECTOR BASED ON PHOTOSTIMUABLE PHOSPHOR TECHNOLOGY, CONSTRUCT A PROTOTYPE, AND VERIFY PERFORMANCE BY USE OF PHANTOMS. COMPUTER SIMULATIONS WILL MEASURE THE RESPONSE OF MATERIALS TO X-RAY ENERGIES PRODUCED BY CONVENTIONAL RADIOGRAPHIC EQUIPMENT. CANDIDATES FOR DETECTOR MATERIALS WILL BE THOSE THAT HAVE LARGE DIFFERENCES IN THEIR RESPONSE TO X-RAYS OF LOW AND HIGH ENERGIES, BUT WILL STILL PRODUCE A QUALITY IMAGE. PHOTOSTIMULATED RESPONSES WILL BE MEASURED FOR ALL CANDIDATE MATERIALS AND ENERGY SELECTIVE DETECTORS WILL BE FABRICATED FOR SELECTED MATERIALS. IMAGES OF SPECIFIC PHANTOMS WILL BE TAKEN, AND A SPECIAL PURPOSE LASER SCANNER WILL MEASURE THE ENERGY SELECTIVE DATA. PHASE II RESEARCH WILL BE DESIGNED TO STUDY SPECIFIC CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF THE ENERGY SELECTIVE SYSTEM BY COMPARISON TO ESTABLISHED MODALITIES AND SURGICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS.",

PROTOTYPE SYSTEMS ARE CURRENTLY IN OPERATION AND LARGE SSYTEMS ARE BEING BUILT, BUT THERE ARE. AS OF NOW, NO SOURCES OD FASTBUS INTERFACE CHIPS. HTESE ARE INTEGRATED CIRCUITS (ICS), WHICH ALLOW A BOARD DESIGNER TO EASILY ADAPT A PARTICULAR DESIGN TO THE FASTBUS ENVIRONMENT. THE FASTBUS IS UNIQUE IN ITS LACK OF SUPPORT FROM SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANIES AS ALL OTHER MAJOR 32-BIT BUS STANDARDS ARE BEING SUPPORTED BY ONE OR MORE IC MANUFACTURERS. THIS STUDY AIMS AT FILLING THIS GAP. SEVERAL EMITTER COUPLED LOGIC (ECL) GATE ARRAYS SUITABLE FOR INTERFACING CIRCUITRY TO THE FASTBUS WILL BE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED. THESE ICS WILL ALLOW FASTBUS DESIGNERS AND MANUFACTURERS EASILY TO ADAPT THEIR IDEAS TO THE FASTBUS ENVIRONMENT, WITHOUT THE NEED FOR AN EXTENSIVE INTERFACE DESIGN AND ITS ASSOCIATED DEBUGGING EFFORT.",

IT IS EXPECTED THAT SUCCESSFUL DEMONSTRATION OF THE QUANTITATIVE USE OF AVHRR DATA WILL MARKEDLY INCREASE USE OF THE DATA BY COMMERCIAL FIRMS AND GOVERNMENT USERS. INVESTMENTS IN CROP ASSESSMENT DATA BY AGRICULTURAL FIRMS IN THE UNITED STATES EXCEED SEVERAL MILLIONS OF DOLLARS; A SUCCESSFUL DEMONSTRATION THATAVHRR COULD ASSIST IN INCREASING COMMERCIAL USES OF AVHRR BYORGANIZATIONS LIKE CROPCAST, ADSERV, CARGILL, ETC. THE POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION AS DESCRIBED BY THE AWARDEE: THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE PROPOSED WORK WILLGENERATE GREAT COMMERCIAL INTEREST AMONG THOSE GROUPS WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT GLOBAL CROP PRODUCTION. CURRENTLY SUCH FIRMS IN THE UNITED STATES AND OVERSEAS SPEND WELL OVER$2,000,000 PER YEAR ON WEATHER DATA ALONE, MUCH OF WHICH IS USED TO DIAGNOSE CROP CONDITION. ADDITIONALLY, LARGE COMPANIES COLLECTIVELY SPEND MANY MORE MILLIONS ON GROUND SURVEY IN THE UNITED STATES AND OVERSEAS. BASED ON MARKET RESEARCH BY EARTHSAT CROPCAST OVER SEVERAL YEARS, IT IS EX- PECTED THAT MANY SUCH COMPANIES WOULD BUY AVHRR OR WOULD BUYSERVICES FROM FIRMS LIKE CROPCAST TO GAIN THE AVHRR INFOR- MATION. MORE AND MORE COMPANIES ARE SHOWING INTEREST IN REMOTE SENSING AS A WAY TO GATHER AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION INTELLIGENCE. THE USDA COULD BENFIT FROM THE PROPOSED WORK THROUGH THE FAS FOREIGN CROP ASSESSMENT. THE SUCCESSFUL WORK COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE DIRECT APPLICATION.

INITIAL DATA SHOW THAT THIS LI/DIOX/C CELL WILL BE A PRIMARY LITHIUM BATTERY WITH THE RATE CAPABILITY AND DISCHARGE CAPACITY OF A LI/SOC12 BATTERY BUT WITH A NON-CORROSIVE ELECTROLYTE AND 25% SECONDARY CAPACITY. THIS NEW CLASS OF LITHIUM BATTERIES WILL PROVIDE NASA WITH A PRACTICAL LONG-LIFE, HIGH POWER/ENERGY DENSITY, SAFE POWER SOURCE FOR USE IN SPACE. THE MAJOR OBJECTIVE OF THE PROGRAM IS TO DETERMINE HOW CARBON-ELECTROLYTE-SOLUTE INTERACTIONS AFFECT THE EXTENT OF REVERSIBLE LITHIUM INTERCALATION AND THE CATHODE POTENTIAL ON DISCHARGE. A SECOND OBJECTIVE IS TO DETERMINE THE PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS OF LITHIUM CELLS WHICH UTILIZE CARBON CATHODES AND 1,3-DIOXOLANE-BASED CATHOLYTES. THE MAJOR ADVANTAGES OF THE USE OF THESE CELL COMPONENTS ARE INCREASED CELL SAFETY, LOWER COSTS, LOWER CORROSION HAZARD ON CELL RUPTURE, AND SIGNIFICANT SECONDARY CAPACITY IN A HIGH-RATE PRIMARY CELL. THE PROGRAM APPROACH IS TO SCREEN A NUMBER OF 1,3-DIOXOLANE-BASED CATHOLYTES AND CARBON TYPES BY CV, IDENTIFY THE BEST COMBINATIONS, AND EVALUATE THE BEST COMBINATIONS IN PRIMARY AND SECONDARY CELLDISCHARGE TESTS.",

INSTEAD, A MOIETY WHICH CAN CREATE FREE CARRIERS IN THE POLYMER CHAIN VIA AN INTERNAL ELECTRON TRANSFER REACTION WILL BE INCORPORATED CHEMICALLY INTO THE POLYMER BACKBONE.

IF PITN FILMS ARE TO BECOME ECONOMICALLY ATTRACTIVE, HOWEVER, METHODS MUST BE DEVELOPED THAT CAN BE SCALED UP TO COAT LARGE AREAS IN A REPRODUCIBLE MANNER AT LOW COST. SEVERAL ALTERNATIVE METHODS TO ELECTROCHEMICAL FORMATION OF PITN WILL BE STUDIED. THESE INCLUDE CONVENTIONAL SPRAY OR SPIN COATING AND NOVEL PHOTOCHEMICAL GAS-PHASE DEPOSITION.

UPON CURING, VOIDS ARE CREATED WHICH REDUCE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPOSITE. ALTHOUGH NON-DESTRUCTIVE EVALUATION TECHNIQUES ARE AVAILABLE TO SPOT THE VOIDS AND HELP TO DETERMINE THEIR SIGNIFICANCE, A PRODUCT FREE OF VOIDS AND POROSITIES IS DESIRED. THE APPLICATION OF ULTRASONIC ENERGY TO THIXOTROPIC AND VISCOUS MATERIALS HAS CONSISTENTLY DEMONSTRATED FLOW PROMOTION EFFECTS. ADDITIONALLY, ULTRASONIC ACTIVATION CAN IMPORVE OR CAUSE FLOW AT SIGNIFICANT LOWER TEMPERATURES THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED WITHOUT ULTRASONICS. AS DEMONSTRATED BY OUR EARLIER WORK, APPLICATION OF ULTRASONICS DURING RESIN PREPARATION, PREPREG PREPARATION AND COMPOSITE LAY-UP AND CURE CAN PROVIDE UNIFORM RESIN FLOW AND WETTING. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PHASE I EFFORT IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY OF UTILIZING ULTRASONIC REACTION ENHANCEMENT TO CAUSE 100% \"WET-OUT\" OF RESIN MATRIX COMPOSITES. THE TOTAL IMPREGNATION OF THE FIBERS WOULD ELIMINATE TRAPPED AIR THUS ELIMINATING VOIDS AND POROSITIES.

THE SOLID PART ICLES CAN BE PRE-FORMED IN A READY-TO-USE STATE. PARTICLE SIZE CAN BE RIGOROUSLY CONTROLLED AND HAVE OPTIMUM FINENESS.THE HIGHER DENSITY OF SOLIDS (TWOFOLD OR BETTER) ALLOWS AER AEROSOL PARTICLES WITH MUCH SMALLER DIAMETERS TO BE USED. THEREFORE, COLLECTION EFFICIENCY SHOULD BE MUCH HIGHER AND THE VOLUME OF AEROSOL REQUIRED MUCH LOWER THAN IF WATER WEREUSED. LIQUIFIED GAS PROPELLANT CAN BE USED TO AEROSOLIZE THETHE PRE-FORMED PARTICLES INSTEAD OF HIGH PRESSURE COMPRESSEDAIR. THIS PERMITS THE SYSTEM TO BE SMALL, SELF-CONTAINED ANDPORTABLE.

THE SYSTEM WILL OPERATE ON A THERMODYNAMIC CYCLE THAT IS A MODIFICATION OF THE CONVENTIONAL RANKINE CYCLE, IN WHICH THE NORMAL BOILER FEED PUMP IS REPLACED BY A \"PASSIVE PUMPING MODULE\" (PPM) AND THE WORKING FLUID IS A SUITABLE ORGANIC FLUID. THIS NEW ORGANIC VAPOR CYCLE IS ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE IT CAN BE USED EFFECTIVELY WITH MEDIUM TEMPERATURE HEAT SOURCES INCLUDING RADIO- ISOTOPES, REACTORS, OR SOLAR COLLECTORS. THE PARASITIC POWER REQUIRED FOR THE BOILER FEED PUMP IN MEDIUM TEMPERATURE CONVENTIONAL ORGANIC RANKINE CYCLE POWER SYSTEMS TESTED TO DATE CAN BE 20% TO 30% OF THE SYSTEM OUTPUT POWER. BY REPLACING THE BOILER FEED PUMP BY THE PPM, THE PARASITIC PUMPING POWER SHOULD BE ONLY 2% TO 3% OF THE OUTPUT POWER. THUS, THE USE OF THE PPM PROMISES HIGHER SYSTEM EFFICIENCY, LIGHTER WEIGHT, AND HIGHER RELIABILITY FOR SMALL TO MEDIUM SIZE ORGANIC RANKINE CYCLE POWER GENERATORS. A MAJOR PART OF THE RESEARCH WILL BE TO DEVELOP A ZERO-GRAVITY PPM. A PPM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED THAT CIRCULATES FREON IN A TERRESTRIAL SOLAR HEATING SYSTEM. ALSO SOLAR RESEARCHERS AT THE LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY HAVE DEVELOPED A SIMILAR PPM. THE ZERO-GRAVITY PPM WILL USE FEATURES OF THE TERRESTRIAL PPMS ALREADY IN USE IN ADVANCED FREON PHASE-CHANGE SOLAR HEATING SYSTEMS.",

ADDITIONALLY, BECAUSE THE SEGREGATION COEFFICIENT OF PHOSPHORUS IS 0.3 AND THAT OF BORON IS 0.8, THESE IMPURITIES ARE RELATIVELY DIFFICULT TO REMOVE FROM SILICON BY PHYSICAL METHODS DURING CRYSTAL GROWTH. IN THIS PROGRAM, A METHOD IS OUTLINED FOR THE REMOVAL OF ALL FOUR OF THESE IMPURITIES BY REACTION WITH RARE EARTH METALS TO FORM THE RARE EARTH OXIDES, CARBIDES, BORIDES, AND PHOSPHIDES, ALL OF WHICH ARE HIGH-MELTING SOLIDS WITH LARGE FREE ENERGIES OF FORMATION.

BY DOPING THE FIBER WITH SPECIAL CHEMICALS, IT WILL EXHIBIT THE FARADAY EFFECT IN THE PRESENCE OF A FIELD. THE SENSITIVITY OF THE FIBER IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE VERDET CONSTANT, WHICH INCREASES WITH INCREASING DOPANT LEVEL. FOR THIS PROGRAM, THE DOPANT IS TERBIUM OXIDE.

THE TOOL, CALLED CAPRA, IS CURRENTLY USED BY THE XEROX CORPORATION TO EVALUATE THE INTERFACE CHARACTERISTICS OF PROPOSED COPIERS AND OTHER OFFICE PRODUCTS. CAPRA USES A STATE-SPACE APPROACH TO CHARACTERIZING AN INTERFACE. THE MODEL SIMULATES THE OPERATOR IN ORDER TO PREDICT IMPORTANT METRICS SUCH AS OPERATOR OPTIONS, TASKS AND DECISIONS. IT ALSO IDENTIFIES THE CRITICAL OPERATOR TIME AMONG THE NEARLY INFINITE NUMBER OF PATHS CONNECTING THE TASK START TO THE TASK CONCLUSION. THE SUCCESS OF A STRUCTURAL MODEL LIKE CAPRA FOR SIMPLE OFFICE MACHINE INTERFACES INDICATES A NEED FOR A SIMILAR CAPABILITY FOR THE MORE COMPLEX HUMANMACHINE INTERFACES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO SET FORTH A MODELING CONCEPT THAT WILL LEAD TO A GENERAL-PURPOSE PREDICTION AND EVALUATION TOOL FOR THE DESIGN OF COMPLEX HUMAN-MACHINE INTERACTIONS. THE FOUNDATION OF THE PROPOSED CONCEPT RESTS ON THE IDEA OF REDUCING THE MODELED STATE-SPACE BY OVERLAYING IT WITH PATTERNS. THE FORM OF THIS STATE-SPACE REDUCTION TECHNIQUE APPEARS TO BE BY WAY OF THE HIERARCHICAL DECOMPOSITION OF COMPLEX HUMAN-MACHINE INTERFACES AND ESTABLISHING THE RELATIONS BETWEEN INTERFACE FUNCTIONAL PATTERNS AND THE OPERATOR'S MENTAL MODELS.",

THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL STUDY AND DEVELOP HIGH PERFORMANCE INSULAR GUIDE CIRCULATORS. DESIGN CONCEPTS FOR FUNDAMENTAL AND HIGHER ORDER MODE FERRITE POST CIRCULATORS ARE PROPOSED. THEORETICAL WORK WILL FOCUS ON THE MODEL CHARACTERIZATION OF THE FERRITE POST AND ANALYTIC PERFORMANCE COMPUTATIONS.

TWO YEARS OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AT EPSILON LAMBDA ON A DIELECTRIC INSULAR WAVEGUIDE INTEGRATED MONOPULSED FRONT END.

THE NEW APPROACH PERMITS FABRICATION AND PRETEST OF FIVE SUBASSEMBLIES SO THAT CRITICAL PHASE AND AMPLITUDE ALIGNMENT CAN BE ACHIEVED. THE SUBASSEMBLIES ARE SUBSEQUENTLY INSERTED INTO THE INTEGRADED FEED/COMPARATOR ASSEMBLY. A SUBSEQUENT PHASE II EFFORT WOULD ALLOW COMPLETION OF THE ENTIRE FRONT END DEVELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATION IN A FORM SUITABLE FOR HIGH VOLUME MANUFACTURING.

MEASUREMENTS WILL BE MADE AT THE BENCH SCALE IN A BATCH-OPERATED ATTRITOR MODIFIED FOR THIS WORK. THE INNOVATIVE CONCEPT TO BE TESTED WILL INCLUDE: A MAJOR CHANGE IN ATTRITOR DESIGN, THE USE OF NOVEL MIXTURES OF CONVEYING LIQUIDS AS OPPOSED TO A SINGLE LIQUID NOW USED IN COMMERCIAL PRACTICE, AND THE USE OF NEW GRINDING MEDIA SPECIFIC TO PREPARATION OF ULTRA-CLEAN COAL. THE CONCEPT IS NOVEL BECAUSE SIZE REDUCTION AND FIRST-STAGE BENEFICIATION ARE CARRIED OUT IN THE SAME DEVICE. THIS CONCEPT WILL ENABLE MINERAL CONTAMINANTS TO BE LIBERATED FROM THE COAL AND REMOVED FROM THE GRINDING CHAMBER BEFORE THEY ARE OVERGROUND. THUS, EXPEDITIOUS SEPARATION OF THE LIBERATED MINERAL CONTAMINANTS BEFORE OVERGRINDING MINIMIZES THE GENERATION OF MINERAL SLIMES AND AIDS THIS AND SUBSEQUENT COA-CLEANING STAGES. FURTHER, THE CLEAN COAL SURFACES PREPARED IN THE NOVEL SIZE-REDUCTION OPERATION ARE PROTECTED FROM UNWANTED DEPOSITION OF MINERAL SLIMES BY THE USE OF THE NOVEL MIXTURE OF LIQUIDS. THIS IS EXPECTED TO FURTHER IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF BENEFICIATION.",

NO SUCH TARGETED HIGH SCHOOL TEACHING MATERIALS CURRENTLY EXIST, ALTHOUGH SELECT SCHOOL DISTRICTS CURRENTLY OFFER BSE INSTRUCTION. RECENT STATE LEGISLATION, (E.G., IN FLORIDA) HAS MANDATED BSE INSTRUCTION AS A HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION REQUIREMENT. OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS SURELY WILL INITIATE BSE INSTRUCTION.

THE MATERIAL CANDIDATE FOR THIS TYPE OF PROTECTION IS A CARBON-CARBON COMPOSITE FOR STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY AND TUNGSTEN CARBIDE COMPONENT FOR NUCLEAR HARDENING. THE CARBON-CARBON COMBINES A HIGH STRENGTH-TO-WEIGHT RATIO IN AN INTEGRAL STRUCTURAL COMPOSITE CAPABLE OF NUCLEAR HARDENING BY THE ADDITION OF TUNGSTEN CARBIDE. THE TECHNIQUE FOR ADDING THE TUNGSTEN CARBIDE INVOLVES REITERATIVE IMPREGNATIONS WITH AN AMMONIUM TUNGSTATE-PHENOLIC RESIN SOLUTION FOLLOWED BY TYPICAL DENSIFICATION CYCLES. EVALUATION OF THIS MATERIAL WILL BE CONDUCTED THROUGH THERMAL DIFFUSIVITY AND SCANNING ELECTRON MICROGRAPHY OF THE TUNGSTEN CARBIDE-CARBON MATRIX.",

THE FIRST IS THE USE OF A CONTROLLED CYCLIC JET ISSUING FROM THE WALL OF A BOUNDARY LAYER TO COLLECT THE TURBULENCE FOR A FINITE TIME AND THE RELEASE ALL OF THE ENERGY INSTANTANEOUSLY IN ONE LARGE EDDY THAT CONVECTS DOWNSTREAM. THE SECOND METHOD INVOLVES A TURRET-LIKE DEVICETO DIVERT THE AIRPLANE'S BOUNDARY LAYER AWAY FROM THE PATH OF THE LASER BEAM. THE RESULTING FREE SHEAR LAYER WILL THENBE ACTIVELY CONTROLLED BY SUBHARMONIC PERTURBATION.

A NEW TECHNIQUE TO REDUCE SKIN FRICTION DRAG IN A TURBULENT BOUNDARY LAYER IS PROPOSED. THE TECHNIQUE COMBINES THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF A LONGITUDINALLY RIBBED SURFACE AND SUCTION. THE SUCTION WILL BE APPLIED SELECTIVELY IN SPACE AND TIME TO MINIMIZE THE PUMPING ENERGY REQUIREMENTS AND TO ALLEVIATE THE NEED FOR USING A POROUS WALL. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE NET DRAG REDUCTION USING THE PROPOSED METHOD WILL FAR EXCEED THAT ATTAINED USING SUCTION ALONE OR LONGITUDINAL GROOVES ALONE.

A TWO-DIMENSIONAL ARRAY OF SMALL CAPACITIVE PROXIMITY SENSORS DETECTS THE DISTANCE BETWEEN EACH SENSOR TIP AND THE TARGET OBJECT. WHEN OPERATING AT A CLOSE DISTANCE TO THE OBJECT (LESS THAN 10 MM), AN IMAGE OF THE SURFACE CONTOUR IS OBTAINED IN ADDITION TO THE DISTANCE INFORAMTION. THE SENSING PROCESS IS CONTROLLED BY A LOCAL MICROPROCESSOR, WHICH ADDRESSES THE SENSORS IN SERIAL ORDER THROUGH A MULTIPLEXER, SAMPLES THE DATA AND LINEARIZES THEM ACCORDING TO THE CALIBRATION CURVE. THE SENSOR ARRAY CAN BE ATTACHED TO A ROBOT END-EFFECTOR. EACH SENSOR ELEMENT CONSISTS OF A THIN SHORT LEAD (LINE CAPACITANCE) EMBEDDED IN A HARD CERAMIC SUBSTRATE. THE SENSORS ARE THEREFORE RUGGED AND CAN, DUE TO THEIR SMALL SIZE, BE MOUNTED AT ALMOST ANY LOCATION ON TEH END-EFFECTOR. THE IMAGING CAPABILITIES OF THE SENSOR ARRAY ARE COMPARABLE TO AN \"EYE-IN-HAND\" CLOSE DISTANCE VISION SYSTEM; THE ARRAY, HOWEVER, CAN OPERATE AT ARBITRARILY CLOS DISTANCES WITHOUT ALIGNMENT OR ILLUMINATIONPROBLEMS. IT OFFERS POTENTIALLY HIGHER ACCURACY AND RESOLUTION WHILE REQUIRING MUCH SIMPLER COMPUTATIONS. FROM THE MEASURED DATA, GEOMETRICAL PARAMETERS CAN BE DETERMINED,SUCH AS MEAN DISTANCE BETWEEN END-EFFECTOR AND WORKPIECE, LOCATINOS OF HOLES AND EDGES AND SPATIAL ANGLES OF THE SURFACE RELATIVE TO THE END-EFFECTOR. THE ACCURACY OF DISTANCE MEASUREMENTS IS BETTER THAN 1 M; THE ACCURACY OF EDGE DETECTION IS BETTER THAN 100 M. COMPARED TO TOUCH SENSORS, THE CAPACITIVE SENSOR OPERATES WITHOUT PHYSICAL CONTACT, REDUCING WEAR, AND OFFERS HIGHER PACKAGE DENSITY AND RESOLUTION.",

AT LOW RELATIVISTIC VELOCITIES, CORRESPONDING TO PARTICLE ENERGY-TO-MASS RATIOS OF 0.8 OR LESS, A VARIETY OF SOLID AND LIQUID MATERIALS CAN BE USED HAVING INDICES OF REFRACTION ABOVE 1.24. AT VERY HIGH VELOCITIES, CORRESPONDING TO PARTICLE ENERGY-TO-MASS RAIOS OVER 10, COMPRESSED GASES MUST BE USED TO ACHIEVE THE VERY LOW INDICES OF REFRACTION REQUIRED FOR DISCRIMINATING BETWEEN PARTICLES. HOWEVER, IN THE INTERMEDIATE ENERGY RANGE OF MEDIUM ENERGY NUCLEAR PHYSICS, CERENKOV DETECTION IS HAMPERED BY THE LACK OF NATURALLY OCCURRING SUBSTANCES WITH INDICES OF REFRACTION BETWEEN ABOUT 1.01 AND 1.20. SILICA AEROGELS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO FILL THIS GAP, AND TETECTORS HAVE BEEN MADE USING THEM WITH VARYING DEGREES OF SUCCESS. PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH THE PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE AEROGELS HAS BEEN THEIR POOR OPACITY, ESPECIALLY AT THE BLUE END OF THE VISIBLE SPECTRUM, BECAUSE OF SCATTERING AND SOME ABSORPTION. RECENT IMPROVEMENTS IN FORMULATING AND PROCESSING THESE MATERIALS HAVE SHOWN THAT SMALL LABORATORY SAMPLES OF HIGH CLARITY CAN BE PRODUCED. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO STUDY MANUFACTURE OF THESE AEROGELS OF IMPROVED CLARITY, WITH CONTROLLABLE INDICES OF REFRACTION IN THE RANGE 1.01 TO 1.20, HAVING LINEAR DIMENSIONS OF 20 TO 30 CM FOR CERENKOV COUNTER APPLICATIONS IN NUCLEAR AND HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS.",

UNTIL NOW THIS RESOURCE HAS NOT BEEN EFFECTIVELY EXPLOITED, LARGELY BECAUSE DURABLE, LOW-COST MATERIALS DO NOT CURRENTLY EXIST FOR MAKING INFRARED-TRANSPARENT GLAZINGS. WITHOUT SUCH A GLAZING, THE RADIATOR SURFACE COOLS WHEN EXPOSED TO THE SKY BUT REGAINS MUCH OF THE HEAT CONVECTIVELY BY COOLING THE OUTDOOR AIR. THIS REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF \"COOLING POWER\" AVAILABLE TO DISPLACE THE BUILDING'S THERMAL LOAD. THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A POLYMER FILM ABOUT 1 MM THICK WITH HIGH INFRARED TRANSPARENCY BETWEEN 8 AND 13 UM. HIGH- AND LOW-DENSITY POLYETHYLENE FILMS EXHIBIT THE HIGHEST INFRARED TRANSMITTANCE OF ALL POLYMERS WITHIN THIS REGION BUT FALL SHORT OF THE DESIRED GOAL BECAUSE OF THE PRESENCE OF ABSORBING NONETHYLENE GROUPS INCORPOR- ATED IN THE CHAIN.

THE SYSTEM PROPOSED OPERATES ON THE STIRLING REFRIGERATION CYCLE. THIS IS A CLOSED, THERMODYNAMIC REGENERATIVE CYCLE IN WHICH THE GASEOUS WORKING FLUID EXPERIENCES REPEATED COMPRESSION AND EXPANSIONOF THE WORKING FLUID AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE LEVELS. THE STIRLING REFRIGERATOR HAS MANY ADVANTAGES OVER THE MORE CONVENTIONAL VAPOR-COMPRESSION SYSTEM WITH AN ORGANIC WORKING FLUID; IT CAN USE THE SPACECRAFT LIFE-SUPPORT GASES AS THE WORKING FLUID. THIS OBVIATES PROBLEMS OF LEAKAGE ANDTHUS RELIEVES THE SEAL PROBLEM. THE INVENTORY OF FLUIDS ON BOARD IS REDUCED. MOREOVER, SINCE THE WORKING FLUID DOES NOT EXPERIENCE A PHASE CHANGE THERE IS NO PROBLEM OF FLUID MANAGEMENT OF LIQUIDS AND VAPORS. THE PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE LEVELS CAN BE INDEPENDENTLY CHOSEN AND VARIES OVER A WIDE RANGE TO ACHIEVE A SPECIFIC COOLING LOAD PROFILE. THERE ARE NO LIMITS TO THE UPPER TEMPERATURE FOR HEAT REJECTION OR THE LOWER TEMPERATURE FOR HEAT ABSORPTION. STIRLING REFRIGERATORS ARE NOT WIDELY USED AT NEAR-AMBIENT TEMPERATURES BUT ARE THE SYSTEM OF CHOICE FOR MINIATURE CRYOCOOLERS IN INFRARED AND OTHER CRYOGENIC ELECTRONIC APPLICATIONS.

THE NEUROFILAMENT PROTEINS ARE ALSO OBSERVED TO BE STRUCTURALLY ALTERED IN THE BRAINS OF PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND RELATED DEMENTIAS. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO EXAMINE IMMUNOCHEMICALLY THE POSSIBLE INVOLVEMENT OF CAP ACTIVITY IN THE NEURONAL LESIONS OF DEMENTIA, AND SEE IF ALTERED PROTEASE ACTIVITY THE PHASE I WORK WILL MAINLY INVOLVE THE PRODUCTION OF MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES TO PURIFIED CAP I AND II BY HIGHLY EFFICIENT IMMUNIZATION, FUSION, AND SCREENING PROCEDURES. APPROPRIATE ANTIBODIES WILL THEN BE USED TO IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICALLY LOCALIZE THE ENZYMES IN BRAIN TISSUE TO SEE IF THE ENZYME (OR LOSS OF ENZYME) IS COINCIDENT WITH THE LESIONS (\"\"PLAQUES'' AND \"\"TANGLES'') SEEN IN THE ALZHEIMER'S BRAIN. AT THE END OF PHASE I, WE WOULD EXPECT TO HAVE HIGH SPECIFIC ANTIBODIES AND BE DETERMINING THE ENZYMES' PRECISE LOCATION IN MAMMALIAN BRAIN.

EARLY DIAGNOSIS IS DIFFICULT AND THERE IS NO DIAGNOSTIC TEST WITH A HIGH POSITIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THE DISEASE. DEVELOPMENT OF A TEST THAT DETECTS EARLY COLORECTAL CARCINOMA WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. TESTING THE FEASIBILITY OF A MONOCLONAL-BASED SERUM TEST FOR A COLORECTAL CARCINOMA MARKER IS NOW WARRANTED. MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES GENERATED AGAINST CRUDE EXTRACTS OF COLORECTAL CARCINOMA CELLS OR FROM HOMOGENATES OF COLORECTAL CELL CULTURES HAVE BEEN PRODUCED BY A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT INVESTIGATORS. SOME MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES WITH POTENTIAL FOR A RAPID TEST HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED BY CHAN'S GROUP AT M.D. ANDERSON. GRANITE DIAGNOSTICS PROPOSES TO EVALUATE THESE ANTIBODIES TO DETECT THE RELEVANT ANTIGEN(S) IN URINE AND/OR SERUM SAMPLES AND TO DEVELOP A TEST FOR EARLY DIAGNOSIS OF COLORECTAL CARCINOMA. FAVORABLE RESULTS IN PHASE I RESEARCH WILL LEAD TO PHASE II DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF A MARKETABLE KIT.",

WE FEEL THAT TI-6A1-4V HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE A SUPERIOR PROSTHETIC SERVICE AS IT A.IS RECOGNIZED AS THE MOST BIOCOMPATIBLE OF DENTAL METALS AND CERTAINLY SUPERIOR TO THE NI AND CO BASED ALLOYS PRESENTLY USED, AND B.POSSESSES A STRENGTH-TO-WEIGHT RATIO SUCH THAT SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN APPLIANCE WEIGHT AND BULK MAY BE ACHIEVED IN THE CLINICAL ROLE. IT ALSO POSSESSES SUPERIOR ELONGATION AND FATIGUE PROPERTIES, ALLOWING FOR ENHANCED CLASP PERFORMANCE. PHASE I OF THIS STUDY WILL INVOLVE THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW CASTING TECHNIQUES UTILIZING THE NEW IMPORTED TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION OF NEW INVESTMENT TECHNOLOGY AND THE EVALUATION OF CASTING RESULTS OBTAINED THROUGH THE COMPARISON OF THE ELECTRIC ARC ARGON PRESSURE CASTING SYSTEM WITH THE ELECTRIC ARC ARGON VERTICAL CENTRIFUGAL SYSTEM. PARAMETERS TO BE EXAMINED INCLUDE MOLD/FURNACE CONTAMINATION OF CASTINGS, CASTING DISTORTION, CASTING INTEGRITY (SURFACE AND VOLUME PORES), AND MICROSTRUCTURE. PHASE II OF THIS STUDY WOULD ENVISION CLINICAL TRIALS OF THE FABRICATED PARTIALS AND SUBPERIOSTEAL IMPLANTS CONDUCTED IN CONJUNCTION WITH MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY, DEPT.

RECENTLY WE SYNTHESIZED A NOVEL TRICYCLIC OXACEPHALOSPORIN WHICH IS EXPECTED TO LEAD TO A SERIES OF COMPOUNDS FROM WHICH ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED. WE NOW PROPOSE THE SYNTHESIS OF A SERIES OF THESE ANALOGS AND THEIR EVALUATION AGAINST A BROAD SPECTRUM OF BACTERIA. BASED UPON PRELIMINARY STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS, THIS NEW OXACEPHALOSPORIN APPEARS TO BE RELATED CLOSELY TO PENICILLINS, AND THEREFORE WE ANTICIPATE SIGNIFICANT GRAM-POSITIVE ACTIVITY IN ADDITION TO THE GRAM-NEGATIVE ACTIVITY CEPHALOSPORINS GENERALLY POSSESS. BY ANALOGY WITH MOXALACTAM, WE ANTICIPATE RESISTANCE TO BACTERIAL ENZYMATIC INACTIVATION, AN ATTRIBUTE WHICH IS INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT DUE TO WIDESPREAD RESISTANCE TO CURRENT ANTIBIOTICS.

THIS COMPOUND IS BACTERIOSTATIC WITH LITTLE FUNGISTATIC ACTIVITY. ALTHOUGH IT IS THE MOST SATISFACTORY COMPOUND CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR SOFT LENS USE, ITS DISADVANTAGES, PRIMARILY IRRITANCY, ARE WELL KNOWN IN THE EYE CARE INDUSTRY.

THE OUTER FLOW OF THE TWO-DECK MODEL RESEMBLES A CONVENTIONAL BOUNDARY LAYER WHICH SLIPS OVER A PERMEABLE SURFACE. THE INNER FLOW IS A ROUGHNESS-DOMINATED FILM-LIKE FLOW WHICH IS MATCHED TO THE OUTER FLOW AT THE LEVEL WHERE LATERAL SPATIAL VARIATIONS DUE TO ROUGHNESS HAVE \"MIXED-OUT\". THE INNER FLOW IS COMPUTED BY LOCALLY SPATIALLY-AVERAGING (IN HORIZONTAL PLANES AT EACH VERTICAL LOCATION) WITH A SCALE LARGE RELATIVE TO THE ROUGHNESS YET SMALL RELATIVE TO THE BOUNDARY LAYER GROWTH RATE. AS A RESULT, ANALYTICAL PARAMETERS ARE DEVELOPED WHICH CHARACTERIZED THE ROUGHNESS AND THE INNER-OUTER INTERFACE LOCATION. THE SURFACE ROUGHNESS, MASS TRANSFER, SKIN FRICTION AND HEAT TRANSFER ARE MODELED WITH SPATIAL/TEMPORAL NON-EQUILIBRIUM AND NON-LINEARITY FORMULATIONS.

AN EXACT METHOD FOR PREDICTING THE TWO-DIMENSIONAL IMAGE OF A TWO-DIMENSIONAL OBJECT IS PRESENTED.

LASER OPTOMETERS AND THE MORE SOPHISTICATED INFRARED 3-D EYETRACKERS ARE EXCELLENT LABORATORY DEVICES, BUT THEY ARE EXPENSIVE, HARD TO USE, AND UNSUITED TO OPERATION IN APPLIED SETTINGS IN WHICH PEOPLE PERFORM REAL-WORLD VISUAL TASKS. ANOTHER MAJOR DRAWBACK OF THESE DEVICES IS THAT THE SUBJECT USING THEM DOES NOT KNOW WHEN HE IS OUT OF ALIGNMENT BECAUSE HE CANNOT SEE THE MEASUREMENT LIGHT. THUS, SMALL PUPILS ARE A LARGE PROBLEM. OUR PROPOSED DEVICE CIRCUMVENTS THAT DIFFICULTY. (SEE LOVASIK'S DISCUSSION OF THE PUPIL PROBLEM IN HIS INFRARED OPTOMETER, 1983).

THE PHASE I EFFORT UNDER THIS PROPOSALWOULD SPECIFICALLY FOCUS ON: (1) IDENTIFICATION OF HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE SPECIES THAT PRODUCE LARGE AMOUNTS OF VALUABLE LIPIDS; (2) ACTUAL CULTURING OF SEVERAL OIL PRODUCING SPECIES TO INCLUDE BOTRYOCOCCUS BRAUNII, CHLORELLA VULGARIS,ETC.; (3) ADAPTATION OF SPIRULINA FIELD CULTIVATION METHODS TO THE OIL PRODUCING SPECIES SELECTED; AND (4) DEVELOPMENT OF HARVESTING AND OIL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY. WE EXPECT TO DEMONSTRATE, FOR AT LEAST ONE SPECIES, THE FOURBASIC PREMISES REQUIRED FOR THE FEASIBILITY OF ENERGY/CHEMICAL PRODUCTION THROUGH AQUACULTURE: HIGH PRODUCTIVITY, HIGH OIL CONTENT, ABILITY TO DOMINATE IN THE POND CULTURE, AND FLOCCULATION FOR SIMPLE HARVESTING.",

THE OBJECTIVE OF THISPROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP, ANALYZE, AND MEASURE A HIGH-PERFORMANCE ALGORITHM FOR INCREMENTAL OVERLOAD RESOLUTION AND TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF COMBINING THAT ALGORITHM WITH OTHER INCREMENTAL COMPILER TECHNOLOGIES IN ANINTEGRATED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT. THE RESEARCH WILL ALSO INCORPORATE SEVERAL PROMISING HEURISTICS FOR IMPROVING THE EXPECTED PERFORMANCE OF THE ALGORITHM. IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER INCREMENTAL TECHNOLOGIES THIS ALGORITHM SHOULD DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE TIME FOR THE EDIT-COMPILE-LINK CYCLE IN THE MAINTENANCE OF VERY LARGE SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS. THE EXPECTED ORDERS-OF-MAGNITUDE REDUCTION IN RESPONSE TIME WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE PRODUCTIVITY OF SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL WITH ATTENDANT GAINS IN SOFTWARE RELIABILITY.",

THE CONCEPT INVOLVES THE USE OF THIN SUPERCONDUCTING FILMS TO ACT AS BOTH ELECTRICAL CONDUCTORS AND AS A HEAT SWITCH BETWEEN THE BOLOMETRIC ELEMENT AND THE COOLING BATH. THE BOLOMETERS ARE SWITCHED BETWEEN THE INTEGRATING STATE (LOW THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY) ANDTHE RESET STATE ( HIGH THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY) USING AN EXTERNAL MAGNETIC FIELD.

NONE OF THESE HAS BEEN EVALUATED ON STEEL BUT THERE ARE NO FUNDAMENTAL REASONS WHY MOST CANNOT BE APPLIED TO STEEL. WHEN THE MEASUREMENT CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED BY MAKING MEASUREMENTS WITH A DEVICE ATTACHED TO A RAILCAR TESTING VEHICLE ARE CONSIDERED, TWO EMAT ULTRASONIC APPROACHES TO ABSOLUTE LONGITUDINAL STRESS MEASUREMENT IN RAILS LOOKATTRACTIVE. EACH APPROACH USES SHEAR HORIZONTAL (SH) WAVES PENATRATING BENEATH THE PLASTICALLY DEFORMED SURFACE LAYER ARE USED. TRANSIT TIME MEASUREMENTS BETWEEN OR N ORTHOGONAL PAIRS OF TRANSDUCER MOUNTED RIGIDLY IN A HOLDER PROVIDE THE BASIC INFORMATION NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE LONGITUDINAL STRESS. THE SECOND APPROACH USES TWO BULK SH WAVES OF THOGONAL POLARIZATION. HERE, THE TRANSIT TIME OF THESE TWO WAVES OVER EXACTLY THE SAME ULTRASONIC PATH PROVIDES THE BASIC INFORMATION NEEDED FOR LONGITUDINAL STRESS DETERMINATION. THE TECHNICAL APPROACHES DESCRIBED IN THIS PROPOSAL PROVIDE INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO THE VERY PRAC PRACTICAL NOISE PROBLEMS OF PERFORMING EMAT MEASUREMENTS WHILE SCANNING THE SENSORS AND TO THE DIFFICULTY OF OBTAINING RELIABLE VELOCITY DIFFERENCE INFORMATION IN A SCANNED ULTRASONIC SYSTEM.",

THE SPECIFIC AIM IS TO CREATE A PROBE FOR THE PERIODONTOPATHOGEN ACTINOBACILLUS ACTINOMYCETEMCOMITANS (AA). THE ASSAY SYSTEM WILL UTILIZE A SMALL PROBE COATED WITH ANTIBODY TO AA MICROBES, WHICH WHEN PLACED AT AN INFECTED SITE WILL SPECIFICALLY BIND AA ORGANISMS. BOUND AA WILL BE IMMUNOLOGICALLY PROCESSED IN VITRO TO PRODUCE AN OPTICAL SIGNAL QUANTITATIVELY THE ASSAY WILL BE RAPID AND SIMPLE, SUITABLE FOR GENERAL OFFICE PRACTICE. IN CONTRAST TO CURRENT METHODS, IT WILL YIELD OBJECTIVE MEASURES WHICH AID IN DIAGNOSIS AND EVALUATION OF ACTIVITY WITHIN LESIONS, THUS ENABLING PHYSICIANS TO PROVIDE BETTER HEALTH CARE. PHASE I RESEARCH FOCUSES ON DEVELOPMENT AND CHARACTERIZATION OF THE ASSAY SYSTEM. CORRELATION WITH CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS WILL BE EXAMINED IN PHASE II.

REASONS FOR RESEARCH: INFORMATION NEEDS OF SYSTEM USERS FREQUENTLY CHANGE. EFFICIENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS MUST BE ABLE TO ACCOMODATE EVOLVING INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS; HOWEVER, AVAILABLE INFORMATION SYSTEMS PROVIDE LIMITED FEATURES FOR DYNAMIC MODIFICATION. METHODS PROPOSED: AN INTELLIGENT DATA BASE MODEL COMPRISED OF THREE MODULES IS PROPOSED. THESE MODULES ARE (1) A DATA MODEL DEFINER, (2) AN INTERPRETATION DEFINER, AND (3) A DATABASE/INTERPRETATION ORGANIZER. THE PROPOSED MODEL IS BASED ON THE ENTITY-RELATIONSHIP MODEL AND ON RESEARCH ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. SPECIFICATIONS FOR EACH MODULE WILL BE DEVELOPED USING THE MOST RECENT RESEARCH ON KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION. ANTICIPATED RESULTS: THE RESULT OF THIS WORK WILL BE SPECIFICATIONS FOR AN INTELLIGENT DATA BASE MODEL WHEREIN DATA ARE STORED AS ENTITIES THAT CAN BE SEMANTICALLY INTERPRETED OR RELATED, USING ADDITIONAL FACTS AND HEURISTICS IN THE KNOWLEDGE BASE TO DERIVE THE DESIRED INFORMATION. IMPLICATIONS OR RESEARCH: THE INTELLIGENT DATA BASE MODEL ISTHE FIRST STEP IN DEVELOPING AN IDBMS. IT WILL PROVIDE THE FRAMEWORK FOR INTELLIGENT INFORMATION RETRIEVAL VIA THE IDBMS. POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS: THE IDBMS IS A WAY TO PERFORM A KNOWLEDGE-BASED SEARCH OF DATA. IT CAN BE USED TO PROCESS ALMOST ALL FORMS OF DIVERSE DATA WHERE CAUSE-EFFECT RELATIONSHIPS ARE SOUGHT.",

THIS PROGRAM WILL EXAMINE THE TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF VACUUM DRYING IN A HIGH CENTRIFUGAL FORCE FIELD. THE INCREASED VAPOR VELOCITIES WITHIN THE CAPILLARIES CAUSED BY INCREASED PRESSURE GRADIENT AS WELL AS HIGH CENTRIFUGAL FORCES APPEAR TO OFFER A PROMISING METHOD TO ENERGY-EFFICIENT FAST DRYING OF HEAT-SENSITIVE CHEMICALS.

CORROSION CRACKING AND DENTING OF THE PRESSURIZED WATER REACTOR (PWR) CYCLE STEAM GENERATOR TUBES AND STRESS CORROSION OF THE BOILING WATER REACTOR (BWR) PIPING AND OF TURBINE DISCS ARE A FEW EXAMPLES OF THE CORROSION PROBLEMS. THESE PROBLEMS CAN BE AVOIDED BY PROPER CONTROL OF IMPURITIES AND WATER TREATMENT ADDITIVES (WATER CHEMISTRY). THE KEY REASON FOR THESE PROBLEMS IS A LACK OF PROPER INTER- PRETATION OF CHEMICAL ANALYTICAL DATA AND THEIR COMMUN- ICATION TO OPERATORS. EXPERT KNOWLEDGE IS OFTEN NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN INSTRUMENT READINGS AND ANALYTICAL RESULTS, OPERATION, AND INGRESS OF CHEMICAL IMPURITIES. IN THIS PROJECT, NEW COMPUTER- BASED TOOLS SUCH AS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNIQUES WILL BE DEVELOPED, WHICH WILL ASSIST NUCLEAR POWER STATION OPERATORS AND CHEMISTS IN DECISION MAKING AND CONTROL OF WATER CHEMISTRY AND OPERATION. SOFTWARE WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR THE TWO COMMON TYPES OF PWR CYCLES (RECIRCULATING AND ONCE-THROUGH), PRIMARY AND SECONDARY, AND FOR BWRS. WITH ONE EXCEPTION, ALL US UTILITY NUCLEAR CYCLES ARE OF THE PWR AND BWR TYPES. THE SOFT- WARE ALSO WILL DIRECT SAMPLING AND ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES AND STORE AND PRESENT ANALYTICAL AND RELATED OPERATION DATA. IT WILL BE CAPABLE OF ACCEPTING FEEDBACK AND UPDATING ITS INTERPRETATION PROCESS (LEARN). THE COMPUTER TECHNIQUES AND THE EXPERT KNOWLEDGE OF THE NUCLEAR CYCLES ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE TO THIS PROJECT.

THE O2 1SIGMA STATE IS PRODUCED BY AN ENERGY-POOLING REACTION (O2 1DELTA + O2 1DELTA YIELDS O2 1SIGMA + 3SIGMA(1)). THE O2 1DELTA ELECTRONIC EXCITED STATE IS PRODUCED BY PRIOR CHEMICAL REACTION. THE SINGLET OXYGEN (SOX) LASER IS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE CHEMICAL OXYGEN-IODINE LASER (COIL), WHICH HAS DEMONSTRATED LASING AT 1.3 MICROMETERS FROM AN ATOMIC IODINE STATE COLLISIONALLY EXCITED BY O2 1DELTA. THE SOX LASER OFFERS THE POTENTIAL OF COMPARABLY HIGH ENERGY DENSITY, REASONABLE GAIN AND GOOD EFFICIENCY. THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS INFLUENCING THE EFFICIENCY OF THE PROPOSED LASER ARE THE RATE CONSTANT FOR ENERGY POOLING (EQ. 1) AND THE QUENCHING CONSTANT THAT REPRESENTS THE SUM OF ALL PROCESSES THAT DEACTIVATE O2 1SIGMA. THE OBJECTIVES OF THE PHASE I EFFORT ARE TO MEASURE THE RATE CONSTANT FOR QUENCHING OF O2 1SIGMA BY O2 1DELTA AND TO CONFIRM ACCEPTED VALUES FOR SEVERAL OTHER RATE CONSTANTS, INCLUDING THE POOLING REACTION (EQ. 1) AND QUENCHING OF BOTH O2 1SIGMA AND O2 1DELTA BY GROUND STATE OXYGEN.

BECAUSE OF STRINGENT POWER AND VOLUME LIMITATION IN THESE DEEP SPACE PROBES, THE SEMICONDUCTOR LASER IS THE ONLY VIABLE CANDIDATEAS A LASER SOURCE. INDIVIDUAL SEMICONDUCTOR LASER DIODES CANNOT MEET THE OTHER REQUIREMENTS OF DEEP SPACE COMMUNICATIONS SUCH AS HIGH BRIGHTNESS AND LOW BEAM DIVERGENCE. HOWEVER, SIMICONDUCTOR LASER DIODE ARRAYS EMPLOYING COHERENT BEAM COMBINING CAN MEET ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS. OUR SOLUTION TO DEVELOPING SUCH A LASER SOURCE IS TO UTILIZE AN EXTERNAL CAVITY TO OBTAIN A COHERENT OUTPUT FROM AN ARRAY OF SEMICONDUCTOR LASER DIODES. THIS CONCEPT IS WELL KNOWN. HOWEVER, WE WILL INCORPORATE NEW TECHNIQUES TO MINIMIZE THE SIZE AND WEIGHT WHILE OPTIMIZING THE OUTPUT OF THE LASER. WITH THIS NEW DESIGN, IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN UP TO 100 WATTS OF CW OUTPUT FROM A TWO-DIMENSION SEMICONDUCTOR LASER DIODE ARRAY MEASURING ONE CENTIMETER SQUARE WHICH MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF A DEEP SPACE MISSION.",

CHANGES IN PARTICLE SIZE WILL BE MONITORED AS A FUNCTION OF STORAGE TIME AND CHANGING TEMPERATURE. PERFORMANCE OF EXPERIMENTAL EMULSIONS WILL BE COMPARED TO THAT OF FLUOSOL-DA 20%. IF ANY EXPERIMENTAL EMULSION IS SUPERIOR, PHASE II STUDIES, PRIMARILY ANIMAL TOXICOLOGY, PLASMA KINETICS, AND EFFICACY STUDIES, WILL BEGIN. IN PHASE II STUDIES, PERFORMANCE OF EXPERIMENTAL EMULSIONS WILL ALSO BE COMPARED WITH FLUOSOL-DA 20%. A COMMERCIAL LICENSE WILL BE SOUGHT AFTER PHASE II.",

IN EFFECT, WE ARE ABLE TO \"\"LABEL'' VARIOUS MOLECULES, SUCH AS PROTEINS, PEPTIDES, AND STEROIDS WITH A NONRADIOACTIVE PROBE. THE LUCIFERIN-DERIVED MOLECULE MAY THEN BE USED IN BIOLUMINESCENT LIGAND RECEPTOR ASSAYS, ANALOGOUS TO RADIOLIGAND RECEPTOR ASSAYS. BECAUSE OF THE SENSITIVITY OF THE LUCIFERIN-LUCIFERASE REACTION (MEASUREABLE LIGHT IS PRODUCED WITH 10 ATAMOLES OF LUCIFERIN) THESE ASSAYS ARE 5005000-FOLD MORE SENSITIVE THAN EXISTING ASSAYS USING 3H-LABELED COMPOUNDS. THIS INCREASED SENSITIVITY IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR THE LOCALIZATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF SPECIFIC NEUROPEPTIDE RECEPTOR SITES IN DISCRETE BRAIN REGIONS. OT AND AVP NEURONS HAVE BEEN VISUALIZED IN MANY BRAIN REGIONS; HOWEVER, SPECIFIC BINDING SITES HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO LOCALIZE AND CHARACTERIZE DUE TO THE RELATIVELY LOW SPECIFIC ACTIVITY OF THE AVAILABLE RADIOLABELED LIGANDS. CONSEQUENTLY, THE INCREASED SENSITIVITY OF LUCIFERIN-DERIVED OT AND AVP WILL BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR THE LOCALIZATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF SPECIFIC RECEPTOR SITES IN DISCRETE BRAIN REGIONS. THIS INFORMATION WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT IN FURTHER ELUCIDATION OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE OF OT AND AVP IN BRAIN FUNCTION. THE SECOND GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH WILL BE TO DEVELOP LUCIFERIN ANALOGS WHICH MAY BE MORE READILY BOUND TO OTHER MOLECULES, ENABLING US TO MORE WIDELY UTILIZE LUCIFERIN-DERIVED COMPOUNDS AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO RADIOLABELED COMPOUNDS.",

THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS AN EXPERIMENTAL EFFORT TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS IDEA. TO THIS END, IGNITION BY IRMPD OF COMBUSTIBLE METHANOL-AIR MIXTURES IS CHOSEN AS A TEST REACTION. AN APPARATUS HAS BEEN DESIGNED FOR DETECTING LASER IGNITION AND SIMULTANEOUSLY MEASURING THE NUMBER OF PHOTONS ABSORBED. IT WILL BE USED TO ESTABLISH WHETHER OBSERVED IGNITIONS ARE TRULY CAUSED BY A MULTIPHOTON PROCESS. THE POTENTIAL FOR ENHANCING FLAME SPEED BY IRMPD WILL ALSO BE EXPLORED BY STUDYING THE TERPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF MULTIPHOTON ABSORPTION.

THESE AND THE MORE RECENT BILAYER COMPOSITES HAVE REVOLUTIONIZED THE ENERGY-INTENSIVE CHLORALKALI INDUSTRY AND MADE SPACE-AGE FUEL CELLS USEFUL IN ORBIT AND FEASIBLE IN ELECTRIC AUTOMOBILES. THESE MATERIALS ARE SUFFICIENTLY GOOD SO THAT PROPOSALS TO IMPROVE THEIR PERFORMANCE MUST BE VIEWED WITH ALERTNESS IF NOT SCEPTICISM. THE LACK OF PERMANENT CHEMICAL CROSSLINKS IN THESE POLYMERS LIMITS THE USEFUL RANGE OF EQUIVALENT WEIGHT BECAUSE THE WATER UPTAKE CAN BE TOO HIGH AS THE WEIGHT IS DECREASED, OR THE ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE CAN BE TOO HIGH AS THE EQUIVALENT WEIGHT IS INCREASED. THE PRACTICAL RANGE HAS BEEN 800 TO 1500, WITH CARBOXYLATE ON THE CATHODE SIDE OF CHLORALKALI CELLS. THE NEW MEMBRANE WILL HAVE INDEPENDENT CONTROL OF SWELLING THROUGH THE WIDE RANGE OF CROSSLINK DENSITY AVAILABLE, AND WILL PERMIT THE EQUIVALENT WEIGHT TO BE ONE-THIRD TO ONE-QUARTER OF THE FIGURES CITED ABOVE. SOLVENTS AND DILUENTS MAY BE USED TO INFLUENCE THE POROSITY AND HENCE THE FLUX RATE. TO PREPARE THE MEMBRANES, SELECTED MONOMERS ARE COPOLYMERIZED TO FORM A PRECURSOR FILM OF DESIRED THICKNESS, CROSSLINK DENSITY, AND FUNCTION- ALITY, AND THEN THE HYDROGEN ATOMS ARE REPLACED VERY CAREFULLY WITH FLUORINE ATOMS USING F2 GAS TO RETAIN THE CARBON SKELETON AS DESIGNED. THE SUCCESSFUL FLUOR- INATION OF FILMS CROSSLINKED WITH RADIATION AND OF ELASTOMERS FOR GEOTHERMAL AND OTHER SEVERE ENVIRONMENTS HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY REPORTED.",

BIOLOGICAL LEACHING IS A COMPOSITE OF DIRECT OXIDATION OF METALS BY THE ORGANISM AND THE OXIDIZING ACTIVITY OF FE3+ PRODUCED BY BIOLOGICAL OXIDATION OF FESO4. THE BLUE COPPER PROTEIN, RUSTICYANIN, IS THOUGHT TO BE THE INITIAL ACCEPTOR OF ELECTRONS FROM FE2+ (COX & BOXER, 1978; COX ET AL., 1978; INGLEDEW, 1982; INGLEDEW ET AL., 1977; 1978) AND OTHER METALS (DISPIRITO & TUOVIENEN, 1982; 1984).

WE HOPE TO DEOMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF A MOLECULAR BIOLOGICAL APPROACH TO CLONING THE GENE ENCODING RUSTICYANIN.

THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS SUPPORT FOR THE EVALUATION OF A NEW APPROACH TO WELD DEFECT CHARACTERIZATION. IT IS PROPOSED TO USE EMATS GENERATING A COMBINATION OF SH, SHEAR-VERTICAL(SV) AND LONGITUDINAL (L)WAVES TO INTERROGATE THE ENTIRE VOLUME OF A WELD FROM CROWN TO ROOT. EACH EMAT IN THE COMBINATION PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT DEFECTS WITHIN A PORTION OF THE WELD; A COMPLETE ASSESSMENT COMES ONLY FROMUSING INFORMATION FROM ALL EMATS. SOME OF THE EMATS USED IN THIS EVALUATION WILL ALSO HAVE THE CAPABILITY OF ELECTRONICALLY SCANNING THE BEAM M ANGLE. THE RESULT OF THIS MULTIPLE INTERROAGATION OF THE WELD FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES IS A MUCH INCREASED RELIABILITY YOF THE ULTRASONIC EVALUATION. (THE PROBABILITY OF MISSING A DEFECT IS VERY SMALL.) SIGNAL PROCESSING METHODS SUCH AS TEMPORAL AVERAGING, SPATIAL AVERAGING, AND SYNTHETIC APERTURE TECHNIQUES WILL BE USED TO INCREASE THE ACCURACY OF DEFECT SIZING, ESPECIALLY DETERMINING THE THROUGH-WALL EXTENT OF A DEFECT. THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO DETERMINE HOW BEST TO IMPLEMENT AUTOMATED ISPECTION METHODS FOR ONE OR MORE COMBINATIONS OF EMATS.",

WE HAVE RECENTLY PRODUCED A MOUSE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY (MAB 1924) WHICH IS BROADLY CROSS-REACTIVE WITH HUMAN SARCOMAS, AND HAVE ADMINISTERED IT TO ANIMALS AND PATIENTS WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT TOXIC EFFECTS. USING IMAGING TECHNIQUES WE HAVE DETECTED TUMOR DEPOSITS IN ANIMALS AND PATIENTS WHO RECEIVED THE RADIOLABELED ANTIBODY. THE SMALLEST HUMAN TUMOR DETECTED MEASURED 1.5 1.0 0.5 CM.

IN THE U.S. CATARACT EXTRACTIONS ARE THE MOST FREQUENTLY PERFORMED OF ALL OPHTHALMIC SURGERIES, NUMBERING 750,000 IN 1984. OF THESE, OVER 80% WERE EXTRACAPSULAR PROCEDURES. THE TECHNOLOGY APPLIED TO NEARLY EVERY PHASE OF EXTRACAPSULAR CATARACT EXTRACTION (ECCE) HAS REACHED A HIGH STATE OF REFINEMENT. THE SIGNIFICANT EXCEPTION IS THE ANTERIOR CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS STILL BEING PERFORMED WITH A BENT NEEDLE IN NEARLY 90% OF ALL CASES. THIS PROCEDURE REQUIRES CONSIDERABLE DEXTERITY AND TRAINING IF DAMAGE TO OTHER INTRAOCULAR STRUCTURES IS TO BE AVOIDED. IT IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY UNSATISFACTORY AS POSTERIOR CHAMBER IOL FIXATION GROWS IN POPULARITY, AS THIS METHOD REQUIRES A CAPSULOTOMY WITH VERY CLEAN EDGES. SEVERAL ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGIES FOR CAPSULOTOMIES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AND TESTED, BUT NONE HAS PROVED TO BE SATISFACTORY. THERE IS STILL A NEED FOR A SAFE, INEXPENSIVE, EFFICIENT, AND CONVENIENT INSTRUMENT FOR PERFORMING ANTERIOR CAPSULOTOMIES. PHASE I OF THIS PROPOSED PROJECT WOULD INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY OF PERFORMING CAPSULOTOMIES WITH A RADIO FREQUENCY CUTTING DEVICE. MID LABS PROPOSES TO BUILD A PROTOTYPE THAT WOULD ALLOW INVESTIGATORS TO VARY CERTAIN CRITICAL EXPERIMENTAL PARAMETERS THROUGH A WIDE RANGE OF VALUES, THUS ENSURING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE OPTIONAL OPERATING MODE FOR RADIO FREQUENCY CAPSULOTOMIES.",

THEY FEATURE LOW-PROFILE, HIGH CONTACT FORCE AND REQUIRE SYMMETRICAL LOADING TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY CONTACT FOR THE DIFFICULT TASK OF SUPERCON- DUCTOR CABLE JOINING. THE ALLOYS AVAILABLE CAN BE DESIGNED TO OPERATE FROM CRYOGENIC TO TEMPERATURES WELL ABOVE 100 DEGREES C, AND IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT BOTH THE DESIGN OF CONNECTORS AS WELL AS THE CHOICE OF APPROPROATE SHAPE-MEMORY MATERIAL HAS A HIGH PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS.",

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE RESEARCH DISCUSSED HEREIN IS TO DEVELOP A COATING MATERIAL WHICH WOULD PROTECT THE UNDERLYING SUBSTRATE AGAINST DEGRADATION DUE TO ATOMIC OXYGEN BOMBARDMENT. IN ADDITION, THIS COATING MATERIAL SHOULD ALSO BE HYDROLYTICALLY, ODIDATIVELY, AND THERMALLY STABLE OVER A WIDE TEMPERATURE RANGE. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT POLYSILOXANE SURFACES REACT WITH ATOMIC OXYGEN TO FORM PROTECTIVE SILICON DIOXIDE COATINGS. POLYIMIDE HOMOPOLYMERSARE KNOWN TO BE THERMALLY AND HYDROLYTICALLY STABLE AND TO POSSESS EXCELLENT MECHANICAL PROPERTIES. THEREFORE, CHEMICALLY, IT IS BELIEVED THAT A POLYSILOXANE-POLYIMIDE COPOLYMER WOULD MAKE AN EXCELLENT COATING. UNFORTUNATELY, POLYIMIDES ARE NORMALLY INTRACTIBLE, INFUSIBLE POLYMERS. POLYSILOXANE-POLYMIDES MADE TO DATE ARE EITHER INSOLUBLE MATERIALS OR HAVE VERY LOW UPPER USE TEMPERATURES DUE TO EXTREMELY SHORT BLOCK LENGTHS OF THE RIGID COMPONENT. THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPMENT OF A SOLUBLE COATING MATERIAL HAVING THE POLYSILOXANE-POLYIMIDE BLOCK COPOLYMER STRUCTURE WILL BE EVALUATED USING THREE BASIC SCHEMES: 1. COPOLYMER SYNTHESIS VIA THE REACTION OF DIISOCYANATES, 2. POLYAMIDE-IMIDE-SILOXANE COPOLYMER SYNTHESIS, AND FINALLY, 3. COPOLYMER SYNTHESIS EMPLOYING A MICHAEL REACTIONFOR CHAIN EXTENSION.",

MEMBRANE PROCESSES HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR GREATLY REDUCING ENERGY REQUIREMENTS FOR INDUSTRIAL SEPARATIONS. THE PRINCIPAL BARRIER TO WIDER USE OF GAS SEPARATION MEMBRANES IS THE DIFFICULTY IN MAKING SUFFICIENTLY SELECTIVE MEMBRANES WITH AN ECONOMICALLY HIGH ENOUGH GAS FLUX. BECAUSE STAGING MEMBRANE MODULES (WHICH WOULD ENABLE OPERATION WITH LOW-SELECTIVITY, HIGH-FLUX MEMBRANES) HAVE NOT PROVED ECONOMICAL, MEMBRANES ARE MADE OF HIGH-SELECTIVITY, LOW-PERMEABILITY POLYMERS FORMED INTO VERY THIN LAYERS OF INCREASED GAS TRANSPORT RATES. WITH CURRENT, ANISOTROPIC MEMBRANE TECHNOLOGY, MEMBRANES WITH BARRIER LAYERS ABOUT 0.1MM CAN BE MADE. FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN PERFORMANCE OF GAS SEPARATION MEMBRANES DEPEND ON DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGIES TO MAKE EVEN THINNER, MORE SELECTIVE MEMBRANES. IMPROVED MEMBRANES FOR HYDROGEN SEPARATION ARE VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF THE INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ROLE FORESEEN FOR HYDROGEN IN SYNFUELS PROCESSING, IN CHEMICAL PRODUCTION FROM SYNTHESIS GAS, IN AMMONIA PRODUCTION, AND IN BOTTOM- OF-THE-BARREL UPGRADING. A NEW APPROACH TO MAKING GAS SEPARATION MEMBRANES FOR HYDROGEN RECOVERY IS PLANNED, WHICH COUPLES THE PROVEN CAPABILITY OF GLOW DISCHARGE POLYMERIZATION TO DEPOSIT FLAWLESS, THIN COATINGS WITH A NOVEL SUBSTRATE. THIS SHOULD SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVE BOTH MEMBRANE HYDROGEN FLUX AND SELECTIVITY OVER PRESENT MODULES AND MAY MAKE TWO-STAGE MEMBRANE MODULE OPERATION ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE, BROADENING THE APPLI- CATION OF MEMBRANES TO HIGHER PURITY HYDROGEN PROCESSING REQUIREMENTS.",

A REVIEW OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY'S (EPA) \"SAFE SLUDGE\" DESIGNATION FOR USE IN FOOD PRODUCTION SHOWS THAT NEARLY HALF OF ALL SLUDGES GENERATED CANNOT BE DEFINED AS \"SAFE,\" THUS ELIMINATING THE COST-EFFECTIVE ULTIMATE DISPOSAL ALTERNATIVE OF LAND APPLICATION. A PROCESS THAT COULD ELIMINATE THE TOXIC CONSTITUENTS OF SLUDGE WOULD BE OF B BENEFIT TO MANY MUNICIPALTIES AND INDUSTRIES. PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS DEVELOPED A PROCESS THAT PROMISES TO BE CAPABLE OF DETOXIFYING SEWAGE SLUDGE IN A COST-EFFECTIVE MANNER. THIS PROJECT OUTLINES THE NEXT PHASE THAT IS NEEDED TO BRIDGE RESEARCH INFORMATION WITH COMMERCIAL APPLICATION. AEROBIC DIGESTION WITH UNIQUE HIGHLY EFFICIENTSELF-ASPIRATING AERATORS WAS SHOWN TO BE CAPABLE OF AUTOHEATING SLUDGES TO PASTEURIZATION TEMPERATURES (50 CT) BY JEWELL IN A FULL SCALE FACILITY IN 1979. FUTHER DEVELOPMENT SHOWED THAT MODIFICATIONS TO THE PROCESS HAVE THE POTENTIAL OF REMOVING PATHOGENS, TOXIC METALS, AND POSSIBLY TOXIC ORGANICS IN A COST-EFFECTIVE SIMPLE PROCESS. AUTOHEATING SLURRY TEMPERATURES CAN EASILY ACHIEVE 60 C WITH MOST SLUDGES WITHOUT HEAT ENERGY ADDITONS (HIGHER TEMPERATURES WOULD BE POSSIBLE WITH HEAT EXCHANGERS), THUS KILLING ALL PATH OGENS. MANIPULATION OF THE PH IN THESE HOT AEROBIC SLURRIES SHOWED THAT GREATER THAN 80% OFMOST TOXIC METAL COULD RAPIDLY SOLUBILIZED (IN LESS THAN 3 HOURS). ALTHOUGH NOT TESTED, AERATION AT THESE TEMPERATURES WILL LIKELY RESULT INVOLATIONLIZATION OF SOME TOXIC ORGANICS. FINALLY, IT WAS SHOWN THAT THE PROCESS COULD ALSO BE APPLIED TO ANAEROBICAL LY DIGESTED SLUDGE. THIS LATER APPLICATION IS IMPORTANT NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE LARGE INSTALLED DIGESTION CAPACITY, BUT SHORT TERM AERATION (6 HOURS) OF ANAEROBICALLY DIGESTED SL SLUDGE RESULTS IN RAPID TEMPERATURE INCREASES, AND SIGN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED SETTLEABILITY AND DEWATERING CHARACTERISTICS THUS ACHIEVING UP TO 50% VOLUME REDUCTION. THUS A HYPOTHETICAL SYSTEM WITH HYDRAULIC RETENTION TIME OF LESS THAN 24 HOURS SHOULD BE CAPABLE OF NOT ONLY SUBSTANT IALLY REDUCING SLUDGE VOLUMES, BUT PRODUCE A SLUDGE THAT WO WOULD MEET EPA'S \"SAFE\" DESIGNATION FOR VIRTUALLY ALL ORGANIC SLUDGES EITHER AS AN ADD-ON PROCESS OR AS A NEW INSTALLATION. THIS STUDY WILL EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF THE UN UNIQUE SELF-ASPIRATING AERATORS ON THE SETTLEABILITY, DEWATERABILITY, AUTOHEATING, AND METAL REMOVAL CHARACTER ISTICS OF ANAEROBICALLY DIGESTED SEWAGE SLUDGE IN A 28M3 FULL SCALE UNIT LOCATED AT THE BINGHAMTON, NY, SEWAGE TRE TREATMENT FACILITY (A 190 MILLION 1/D CAPACITY PLANT). THREEOTHER SLUDGES REPRESENTING A WIDE RANGE OF CONTAMINANTS, W WILL BE TRUCKED TO THIS FACILITY AND USED IN SHORT TERM B BATCH TESTS. THE RESULTS OF THESE TRIALS WILL BE USED TO ESTIMATE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS AND TO ESTIMATE THE FEASIBILITYOF THE PROCESS.",

THE GOAL OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP A SENSITIVE AND SPECIFIC MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY DIAGNOSTIC ASSAY TO QUANTITATE DI INFECTIONS.

N A T DEVELOPMENT HAS DEVELOPED A THREE PART APPROACH TO ACHIEVE EMP SHIELDING IN NEW AND USED EQUIPMENT THAT PROVIDES SUPERIOR ECONOMICS, AS WELL AS IMPROVED PHYSICAL PROPERTIES. THE APPROACH INVOLVES: 1) CREATION OF A NEW CONDUCTIVE MOIETY COMBINING THE EMP CONDUCTIVE EFFICIENCIES OF SILVER AND/OR GOLD WITH GLASS SPHERES AND/OR HOLLOW GLASS BEADS TO OBTAIN A COATED MATERIALS WITH EMP CONDUCTIVE PROPERTIES EQUAL TO SILVER AND GOLD AT APPROXIMATELY ONE-SEVENTH THE LOADING WITH SUPERIORDENSITY AND VOLUME CONCENTRATION. 2) INCORPORATION AND STABILIZATION OF THESE MATERIALS TO ACHIEVE EMP RESISTANT COATINGS THAT CAN BE APPLIED DIRECTLY TO NEW OR USED EQUIPMENT, FACILITY WALLS, OR FABRIC, TO CREATE A PORTABLE EMP SHROUD OR EMP \"FREE\" ZONE. 3) THE LAST PROJECT EFFORT IS TO OPTIMIZE THE HIGHLY CONDUCTIVE NEW FILLER.

A NEW METHOD OF PROCESSING WHICH ALLOWS FOR FABRICATION OF HOLOGRAPHIC MIRROR WHICH REFLECTS BOTH THE LASER FUNDAMENTAL AND ITS FIRST OVERTONE (E.G., NDYG 1.06 AND 0.53 MICROS) HAS RECENTLY BEEN DOCUMENTED IN THE NTS LABORATORIES. IT IS PROPOSED TO APPLY THIS SUPER HIGH EFFICIENCY HOLOGRAPHIC TECHNOLOGY TO THE PROTECTION OF THE EYE AGAINST VISIBLE AND NEAR IR WAVELENGTHS.

IN PRESENT COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS, FORCED OUTAGES CAUSED BY STEAM GENERATOR TUBE LEAKS HAVE EXCEEDED ALL OTHER CAUSES COMBINED AS A CAUSE OF UNPLANNED DOWNTIME. THEREFORE, AN IN-SERVICE INSPECTION SYSTEM IS NEEDED FOR THE EXAMINATION OF LIQUID METAL REACTOR (LMR) STEAM GENERATOR TUBES AND THE TUBE-TO- TUBESHEET WELDS. THIS PROJECT IS TO DEMONSTRATE A NEW ELECTROMAGNETIC METHOD FOR IN-SERVICE TUBE INSPECTION. TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF IN-SERVICE INSPECTION ARE ARE POSSIBLE USING THIS NEW METHOD: (1) THE DETECTION AND QUANTITATIVE IDENTIFICATION OF LOSS OF METALLIC CROSS-SECTIONAL AREA (LMA) CAUSED BY CORROSION, THINNING, AND WASTAGE; AND (2) THE DETECTION OF LOCALIZED FLAWS (LF) SUCH AS STRESS CORROSION CRACKING, PITTING, DENTING, AND MECHANICAL DAMAGE. FEASIBILITY WILL BE STUDIED BY BUILDING AND TESTING A PROTOTYPE INSPECTION SYSTEM. IF FEASIBLE, THE PLANNED TECHNIQUE WILL REQUIRE SUBSTANTIALLY LESS INSPECTION TIME THAN CURRENT ULTRASONIC METHODS. FURTHERMORE, COMPARED TO OTHER INSPECTION METHODS, THE NEW TECHNIQUE PROMISES SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO, FLAW DETECTABILITY, PENETRATION DEPTH, AND QUANTITATIVE FLAW IDENTIFICATION ACCURACY.",

THE \"\"KILLER'' FUNCTION OF K/NK CELLS IS ANTIBODY-DEPENDENT CELLULAR CYTOTOXICITY (ADCC), WHEREAS THE \"\"NATURAL KILLER'' FUNCTION IS AN ANTIBODY-INDEPENDENT CYTOLYTIC PROCESS. ALL K/NK CELLS BEAR FC RECEPTORS (FCRS) ON THEIR SURFACES WHICH SPECIFICALLY BIND TO THE FC PORTIONS OF ANTIBODIES ON ANTIBODY-COATED TARGET CELLS. FCR/FC INTERACTIONS CAUSE K/NK CELLS TO FORM SPECIFIC CONJUGATES WITH THEIR TARGET CELLS THUS INITIATING THE ENSUING LYSIS OF THE TARGETS. THE FCRS' INTERACTION WITH ANTIBODY AND THE ROLE THAT SUCH INTERACTIONS PLAY IN TRIGGERING THE LYTIC PROCESSES ARE NOT PRESENTLY UNDERSTOOD. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE EXPERIMENTS PROPOSED HERE IS TO DEVELOP A SIMPLE AND EFFICIENT METHOD FOR PREPARATIVELY PURIFYING THE FCRS OF K/NK CELLS ISOLATED FROM HUMAN PERIPHERAL BLOOD LEUKOCYTES (PBL) USING AN ANTI-FCR MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY AND CONVENTIONAL BIOCHEMICAL AND IMMUNOCHEMICAL STRATEGIES FOR MEMBRANE PROTEIN PURIFICATION. THE INITIAL STUDIES WILL FOCUS ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE FCR BY DETERMINING THE NUMBER OF POLYPEPTIDE SUBUNITS COMPRISING THE FCR AND POTENTIAL PRECURSOR/PRODUCT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DIFFERENT SUBUNITS. PURIFIED FCR MOLECULES WILL BE FRAGMENTED BY CNBR AND THE RESULTING PEPTIDE FRAGMENTS WILL BE CHARACTERIZED BY GEL FILTRATION AND BY SDS POLYACRYLAMIDE GEL ELECTROPHORESIS. THE PHASE II OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT WOULD BE TO DETERMINE ENOUGH OF THE AMINO ACID SEQUENCE OF FCR MOLECULES TO MAKE POSSIBLE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SUITABLE OLIGONUCLEOTIDE PROBE TO BE USED FOR ISOLATING THE FCR GENE(S) FROM THE HUMAN GENOME. THE ISOLATED GENE(S) WOULD ALLOW ONE TO CONDUCT MOLECULAR STUDIES OF FCR/FC INTERACTIONS AND THE LYTIC PROCESS. THE SEQUENCE OF THE GENE(S) COULD ALSO BE USED TO DEVELOP MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY PROBES AGAINST SELECTED PORTIONS OF THE FCR STRUCTURE CLINICALLY TO EVALUATE K/NK CELL FUNCTIONS AND MODIFY K/NK FUNCTIONS' RESPONSE TO DISEASE.",

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PHASE I STUDIES IS TO:1) DEVELOP A PERMANENT DATA BASE FROM DIGITIZED IMAGE EN- HANCE ORIGINAL TEST FILM IN WHICH TO DEMONSTRATE AN IMPROVEDCAPABILITY IN PERFORMANCE TWO-DIMENSIONAL SIGNAL PROCESSING BY OPTICAL SENSOR ALGORITHM, AND 2) DEVELOP POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY PROFILES. IN PHASE II: 1) THE EFFECTIVE METHOD WILL BE FURTHER IMPROVED, 2) TWO-DIMENSIONAL SIGNAL PROCESSING CLUTTER MODELS WILL BE DEVELOPED AND FORMATTED FOR TESTING BY POTENTIAL USERS, AND 3) PROVIDE CONCEPTS AND TECHNIQUES FOR IMPROVING THE IR SYSTEMS FUNCTIONS OF ACQUIRING, TRACKING, AND INTERCEPTING RV'S TO THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS EFFECT OF REDOUT. THE METHOD WILL BE TO EFFECTIVELY DIGITIZE THE APPROPRIATE EG&G; TEST FILM OBTAINED FROM DNA. THE APPROACH USED IN PHASE I WILL BE A STANDARD IMAGE RESTORATION MODEL THA CAN FIND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DENSITY OF A PHOTOGRAPHIC NEGATIVE AND LIGHT INTENSITY DURING EXPOSURE TO ARRIVE AT THE ORIGINAL SOURCE OF ENERGY, WHILE WORKING IN THE FREQUENCY DOMAIN, THAT PRODUCED THE VARIATIONS OF VISIBLE INTENSITY IN EACH PICTURE FRAME.",

IN PHASE I, WE WILL CONCENTRATE ON THE REMAINING HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PROBLEMS IN DATA ACQUISITION, SO THAT GOOD QUALITY DATA CAN BE RECORDED FROM PATIENTS FROM INFANTS TO ADULTS. IN PHASE II, EMPHASIS WILL SHIFT TO RESEARCH ON PROCESSING AND ANALYZING THE POTENTIAL DATA AS A THREE-DIMENSIONAL SET OF VALUES, WHERE INFORMATION IS ENCODED IN THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL FEATURES.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS PHASE I EFFORT IS TO: 1. OPTIMIZE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE REVERSING DC MOTOR, DURING THE PERIOD OF ITS REVERSAL, BY EMPLOYING THE METHODS OF DYNAMIC BRAKING, COASTING, AND PLUG REVERSING WITH PULSE WIDTH MODULATION, TO MINIMIZE THEPOWER REQUIRED TO REVERSE THE PUMP; AND 2. PROVE THE UTILITY OF A ZINC-AIR BATTERY PACK TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE POWER AT REDUCED VOLUME AND WEIGHT. BENCH TESTING WILL BE PERFORMED TO IDENTIFY THE OPTIMUM CONTROLLER CONFIGURATION. THEN THE OPTIMUM CONFIGURATION WILL BE TESTED USING ACTUAL BATTERY PACKS TO DETERMINE THE MAXIMUM TIME OF BATTERY USE. THE BATTERY PACKS WILL BE CONSTRUCTED USING ZINC-AIR BUTTON CELLS WHICH HAVE AN ENERGY DENSITY TWELVE TIMES THAT OF HIGH QUALITY NICKEL-CADMIUM CELLS. THE PRESENT CONTROLLER CONFIGURATION WILL BE TESTED TO ESTABLISH A BASE LINE.",

THE GOAL OF PHASE I IS TO PROVE THE FEASIBILITY OF A PORTABLE ASSISTER. ALTHOUGH THE FIRST UNIT WILL USE SEVERAL COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE COMPONENTS (PUMP, VALVE, AND BATTERY), A PORTABLE UNIT (CAMERA CASE CONFIGURATION WEIGHING 12 TO 15 POUNDS) WILL BE CONSTRUCTED. IN PHASE II, PERFORMANCE TESTS WITH HUMAN PATIENTS WILL LEAD TO THE OPTIMIZATION OF INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS, AND SPECIAL DESIGNS OF EACH WILL BE DEVELOPED IF NECESSARY. THAT WILL ALLOW THE WEIGHT TO BE REDUCED FURTHER. THEN IN PHASE III, PRODUCTION MODELS, WEIGHING APPROXIMATELY 6 POUNDS WITH A USEFUL BATTERY TIME BEFORE RECHARGING OF APPROXIMATELY 8 HOURS, WILL BE CONSTRUCTED WHICH WILL OFFER SIMPLE, RELIABLE, AND PERSONALIZED SUPPORT TO A POPULATION WHICH CURRENTLY EXPERIENCES 19,000 DEATHS PER YEAR.",

OPERATOR, AS WELL AS MOTION PARAMETERS OF THE VEHICLE, TO ASSESS A STATE OF OPERATOR PARTIAL OR COMPLETE DISABILITY, SUCH THAT VEHICLE CONTROL COULD BE TRANSFERRED APPROPRIATELY TO AN AUTOMATIC GUIDANCE SYSTEM. CANDIDATE PHYSIOLOGICAL FACTORS ARE DISCUSSED AND TRANSDUCERS FOR THEIR MONITORING IDENTIFIED.A NEED FOR CAREFUL INTEGRATION AND INTERPRETATION OF THE SENSOR READINGS TO AVOID FALSE DECLARATIONS OF DISABILITY IS EMPHASIZED. VEHICLEPARAMETERS (SPEED, HEADING, PRIOR TRACK, ACCELERATIONS, ALTITUDE, ATTITUDE, ETC.) ARE ALSO DISCUSSED. BEHAVIORAL SENSORS COULD FUNCTIONIN A FEEDBACK LOOP REQUIRING THE OPERATOR TO RESPOND TO SYSTEM QUERIESIN A MANNER THAT DEMONSTRATES ALERTNESS, RATIONAL CAPABILITY AND PHYSICAL COORDINATION. ADDITIONALLY, BEHAVIOR ABNORMALITIES COULD BE DETECTED BY HIS FAILURE TO CARRY OUT SCHEDULED FUNCTIONS OR A PRESCRIBED VEHICLE EVOLUTION. A MICROPROCESSOR COMPUTER INTEGRATES THE SENSOR READINGS AND ASSESSES, CONTINUOUSLY, THE OPERATOR'S FUNCTIONAL STATUS. ALGORITHMS FOR THIS PURPOSE SHOULD POSSESS INDIVIDUAL SENSOR THRESHOLDS AND PRIORITY RATINGS THAT ADAPT TO THE SCENARIO AND THE ENVIRONMENT. A MULTI-STEP DECISION PROCESS INVOLVING OPERATOR ALERT, DEMAND FOR AND EVALUATION OF OPERATOR RESPONSE, AND CONTROL TRANSFER IS SUGGESTED.",

A RELIABLE AND INEXPENSIVE BIT WEAR SENSING SYSTEM WOULD READILY BE ACCEPTED AND IMPLEMENTED BY MOST DRILLING OPERATORS IN ORDERTO: (1) MINIMIZE UNNECESSARY DOWNTIME RESULTING FROM THE RETRIEVAL OF \"GREEN\" BITS, (2) MINIMIZING THE CATASTROPHIC FAILURE OFTEN RESULTING FROM THE CONTINUED USE OF A WORN BIT, AND (3) DETERMINING OPTIMAL DRILLING SPEEDS. DUE TO THE HIGHLY \"NOISY\" NATURE OF SURFACE DRILLING MEASUREMENTS, ADVANCED SIGNAL PROCESSING TECHNIQUES WILL BE USED TO DEVELOP A RELIABLE AND ADAPTIVE BIT WEAR ESTIMATION SYSTEM WHICH CAN COPE WITH THE HIGHLY \"INAUSPICIOUS\" AND UNPREDICTABLE DRILLING ENVIRONMENT. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM WOULD PROVIDE A LOW COST ALTERNATIVE TO BIT WEAR ESTIMATION SCHEMES TO BE PROVIDED IN THE NEAR FUTURE BY MOST COMMERCIAL MWD SYSTEMS, WHICH WOULD RELY ON DOWNHOLE SENSORS. ALTHOUGH THE PERFORMANCE OF THE LATTER WOULD BE SUPERIOR TO THAT OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH, THE COSTWOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER AND IN FACT PERHAPS PROHIBITIVE FOR MANY SMALL RIG OPERATORS.",

MANY TYPES OF PURIFICATION AND FRACTIONATION PHILOSOPHIES, E.G., ADSORPTION (BOTH IONIC AND NONIONIC SUBSTRATES), SOLVENT-ANTISOLVENT PRECIPITATION, ETC., HAVE BEEN DIRECTED TO THE PROBLEM WITH VARYING RESULTS. SUPERCRITICAL FLUID SOLVENTS, I.E., GASES AT CONDITIONS ABOVE THEIR RESPECTIVE CRITICAL POINTS, EXHIBIT PRESSURE-DEPENDENT DISSOLVING POWER PROPERTIES AND THE ABILITY TO DISSOLVE SELECTIVELY ONE OR A FEW COMPONENTS IN A MIXTURE CAN BE CONFERRED TO THEM BY VIRTUE OF APPLIED PRESSURE. DATA ARE PRESENTED IN THE WORK PLAN ON THE FRACTIONATION AND PURIFICATION OF THREE REFRACTORY AND LABILE POLYMERS, AND THE METHODOLOGY USING SUPERCRITICAL SOLVENTS IS EXTENDED TO THE PLURONIC 68 POLYMER. A RESEARCH PROGRAM WHICH MEASURES SOLUBILITY, DETERMINES FRACTIONATION CHARACTERISTICS, VERIFIES MOLECULAR WEIGHT RANGES AND POLYDISPERSITY BY VISCOSITY AND GEL PERMEATION CHROMATOGRAPHY, AND EVALUATES TOXICITY BY WHITE CELL AGGREGATION TESTING IS DESCRIBED. BECAUSE THE PROBLEM OUTLINED IS A CURRENT AND REAL ONE FACING RESEARCHERS, SUPPLIERS, AND THE EVENTUAL SUBJECTS BEING ADMINISTERED THE OXYGEN CARRIERS, AND BECAUSE THESE OXYGEN CARRIERS HAVE USES FARTHER REACHING THAN SURGERY FLUIDS, SUCCESSFUL DEMONSTRATION OF THE ABILITY OF SUPERCRITICAL FLUID SOLVENTS TO PRODUCE FRACTIONS DEVOID OF TOXICITY PROBLEMS WOULD WARRANT A PHASE II STUDY. FURTHERMORE, THE DEMONSTRATION THAT THE FRACTIONS ARE REPRODUCIBLE AND OFFER REASONABLE ECONOMICS WILL BE STRONG INDUCEMENT TO CARRY THE STUDY FROM THE LABORATORY TO A COMMERCIAL PHASE.",

SUCH SPECIES AS O2(A1 ), N2(A3 ), AND N2(X,V>>0)MAY BE PRODUCED AND FURTHER EXCITED IN THE SHOCK LAYER OF SPACECRAFT UNDERGOING HIGH ALTITUDE REENTRY. THE QUENCHING OF THESE SPECIES ON SPACECRAFT SURFACES MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL HEAT LOAD ON THE VEHICLE. IN PHASE I RESEARCH WEWILL DEMONSTRATE THE ABILITY TO DETECT O2 (A1 ) AND N2(X,V) USING MPI AND N2(A3 ) USING LIF IN A DISCHARGE FLOW REACTOR LINED WITH VARIOUS SPACECRAFT MATERIALS. THE REACTOR WILL BE USED TO CONDUCT SCREENING TESTS TO OBTAIN 300K SURFACE DEACTIVATION COEFFICIENTS FOR THESE MOLECULES. PHASE I EFFORTS WILL ALSO FOCUS ON THE DESIGN OF A MOLECULAR BEAM/SURFACE SCATTERING EXPERIMENT TO BE CONSTRUCTED UNDER PHASE II. THIS EQUIPMENT WILL USE A DISCHARGE-EXCITED SUPERSONIC MOLECULAR BEAM OF METASTABLE MOLECULES SEEDED IN HE TO ACHIEVE TRANSLATIONAL VELOCITIES IN EXCESS OF 4000K FOR O2 OR N2. THE MPI AND LIF TECHNIQUES DEMONSTRATED IN PHASE I WILL BE USED TO DETECT MOLECULES SCATTERED OFF THE SURFACES AND THE LASER POLARIZATION DEPENDENCE OF THE LIF SIGNAL WILL BE USED TO OBTAIN ANGLE INTEGRATED EXCITATION AND QUENCHING EFFICIENCIES.",

TO DETECT LOW LEVELS OF ANTIGENIC BEHAVIOR BY MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES RAPIDLY, A NEW PREACTIVATED LATEX MICROPARTICLE SYSTEM WILL BE SYNTHESIZED TO ENHANCE THE EASE OF TAGGING SUCH ANTIGENS WITH ANTIBODIES. THE MICROPARTICLES WILL BE PREACTIVATED WITH N-HYDROXYSUCCINIMIDE ESTER UNITE AND LYOPHILIZED TO PREVENT HYDROLYTIC DEGRADATION ON STORAGE. BY SELECTING APPROPRIATE MONOMERS, HIGHLY CROSS-LINKED MICROPARTICLES OF HIGH POLARITY WILL BE FORMED WHICH REACT COVALENTLY WITH PROTEIN. HIGH DENSITY OF THE NEW LATEX PARTICLES WILL PERMIT EASY SEPARATION FROM SERUM. THEIR HIGH POLARITY WILLREDUCE OR ELIMINATE NON-SPECIFIC BONDING OF ANTIGENS. THESEPARTICLES WILL BIND TO MONOCLONAL ENTIBODIES WITHOUT FURTHERACTIVATION. BECAUSE OF THEIR HIGH DENSITY AND FLUORESCENCE OF THE LATEX TAG, THE MICROPARTICLE-ANTIBODY WILL PERMIT DETECTION OF LOW CONCENTRATIONS OF ANTIGENS BY FLOW CYTOMETRY OF AGGLUTINATION PROCEDURES. THE PRE-ACTIVATED NATURE OF MICROPARTICLES SHOULD GREATLY REDUCE PROCESSING TIME. IN PHASE I, THE FEASIBILITY OF PREPARING TECHNOLOGICALLY NOVEL LYOPHILIZED, PRE-ACTIVATED HIGH DENSITY LATICES AND THE SUITABILITY OF USING THESE MATERIALSFOR LOW-LEVEL ANTIGEN DETECTION WILL BE STUDIES. PHASE II WILL DEAL WITH OPTIMIZATION OF LATEX COMPOSITIONS OF PARTICLE SIZES AND OF VOLUME PRODUCTION OF LATICES. COMMERCIALLY, SUCH MATERIALS WILL FIND APPLICATION IN THE DETECTION OF THE ANTIGENIC ACTIVITY OF HEMATOLOGIC COMPONENTS OR HEMATOPOIETIC HAROMNES WITH APPROPRIATE ANTIBODIES.",

THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP A RECOMBINANT DNA VACCINE AGAINST FHV-1 THAT IS SAFER AND MORE IMMUNOGENIC THAN EXISTING PRODUCTS. DURING PHASE I A PANEL OF MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES AGAINST THE SURFACE GLYCOPROTEINS OF FHV-1 WILL BE DEVELOPED AND SCREENED FOR ANTIGENIC SPECIFICITY AND VIRUS-NEUTRALIZING ABILITY. THESE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES ARE THE ESSENTIAL TOOLS FOR ISOLATION OF INDIVIDUAL GLYCOPROTEINS WITH AFFINITY COLUMNS, MAPPING OF THE GLYCOPROTEIN GENES, AND SCREENING OF EXPRESSION VECTOR PRODUCTS, THE MAJOR OBJECTIVES OF PHASE II. THE VALUE OF THIS SYSTEM AS A MODEL FOR HUMAN HERPESVIRUS VACCINE DEVELOPMENT COMES FROM THE FACT THAT IT ALLOWS DEFINITION OF GLYCOPROTEIN-INDUCED IMMUNITY IN THE NATURAL HOST OF THE DISEASE.",

THE PLAN IS TO DISSOLVE THESE COMPLEXES IN A SOLVENT PHASE AND FACILITATE TRANSPORT ACROSS A POROUS POLYMERIC MEMBRANE. THE COMPLEX BINDS O2 AT THE FEED-STREAM/MEMBRANE INTERFACE, DIFFUSES ACROSS THE MEMBRANE AS THE OXYGENATED COMPLEX, RELEASES O2 TO THE PRODUCT STREAM, AND DIFFUSES BACK TO THE FEED-STREAM/ MEMBRANE INTERFACE TO REPEAT THE PROCESS. AN ORDER-OF- MAGNITUDE HIGHER PERMEABILITY AND SELECTIVITY FOR O2 OVER SILICONE RUBBER IS EXPECTED FROM SUCH MEMBRANES.

THE MAJORITY OF INTRAPARTUM ENDOCRINE ASSESSMENT OF THE COMPLEX MATERNAL-FETAL-PLACENTAL UNIT IS ONE APPROACH TO EARLY RECOGNITION OF FETAL DISTRESS. STEROID HORMONES OFFER SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE IN THIS REGARD, SINCE BIOSYNTHESIS OF ESTROGENS, PARTICULARY ESTRIOL (E3), INVOLVES FETAL ORGANS SUCH AS LIVER AND ADRENAL AS WELL AS PLACENTA AND MATERNAL LIVER. ESTETROL (E4), IS ANOTHER STEROID PRODUCED BY FETAL LIVER AND HAS NO CIRCADIAN RHYTHM. SERUM UNCONJUGATED ESTRIOL (E3) ASSAYS ARE WIDELY UTILIZED DURING THE THIRD TRIMESTER OF COMPLICATED PREGNANCY. HOWEVER, THE CLINICAL USEFULNESS OF SUCH ASSAYS IS DEBATABLE. DAILY SERUM E3 MEASUREMENTS ARE REQUIRED FOR PREDICTABLE RESULTS. IN ROUTINE CLINICAL PRACTICE, MATERNAL BLOOD SAMPLES ARE DIFFICULT TO COLLECT MORE THAN ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK. WEEKLY OR BIWEEKLY RESULTS ARE DISAPPOINTING, PARTICULARLY IN PROBLEM PREGNANCIES. SALIVA OFFERS AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE FOR DAILY ASSESSMENT OF E3. KUNDU ET AL. HAVE ALREADY SHOWN ITS USEFULNESS BY RADIOIMMUNOASSAY (RIA) OF E3 IN SALIVA. ALTHOUGH E3 PROVIDED THE BASIS FOR ASSESSMENT OF PREGNANCY STATUS, DETERMINATION OF E4 LEVEL (A PRODUCT OF FETAL LIVER) WILL BE A PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE AND RELIABLE INDICATOR OF FETAL WELL-BEING. IT IS ALSO ASSAYED BY RIA IN A FEW LABORATORIES. HOWEVER, RIA IS A SOPHISTICATED PROCEDURE REQUIRING SPECIAL REAGENTS, RADIOACTIVE LIGANDS AND SPECTROMETER FOR RADIOACTIVITY DETERMINATION. THIS ASSAY IS EXPENSIVE AND LABOR-INTENSIVE. THE PRESENT PROPOSAL AIMS TO 1. DEVELOP SPECIFIC MONOCLONAL AND POLYCLONAL ANTIBODIES TO E3 AND E4 AND 2. PREPARE SPECIFIC ANTIBODY REAGENTS FOR NONISOTOPIC IMMUNOASSAY KITS FOR USE AT HOME OR IN HOSPITALS. THESE SPECIFIC AND HIGHLY SENSITIVE ASSAYS WILL BE SIMPLE AND RELIABLE.

THIS PROPOSED SHUNT SYSTEM COMPRISED A FIXED SIZE CAPACITOR AND A SYSTEM OF COUPLED FIXED RATIO AND VARIABLE RATIO TRANSFORMERS. THEMODULATING CONTROL CAN NOT CAUSE ELECTRIC TRANSIENTS, WHICH ARE AN UNDESIRABLE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE OLD ART OF CAPACITOR SWITCHING. IN THOSE SYSTEMS IN WHICH THE DISTORTED SINE WAVE IS STRONGLY PRESENT, THE WATT LOSS CONTROL ADOPTED BY THIS SYSTEM ASSUMES GREATER IMPORTANCE THAN THE POWER FACTOR CONTROL. THE FACT THAT THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF HAVING TO DO WITH A DISTORTED SINE WAVE BRINGS THE PROBABILITY OF GETTING INTO RESONANCE IN ONE OF THE HARMONICS, THE 5TH, 7TH, 9TH, OR 11TH. THE AMPLITUDE OFTHE HARMONIC MIGHT BECOME SO SIGNIFICANT THAT IT MAY EXCEED THE ALLOWABLE LIMITS OF THE EQUIPMENT. THAT REQUIRES INSERTION OF A HARMONIC SUPPRESSING REACTOR INTO THE POWER CIRCUIT. THE PRACTICAL SOLUTION SEEMS NOW TO BE A DETECTION SYSTEM FOR DI2/DVAR BEFORE THE CORRESPONDING CURRENT REACHES A HARMFUL LEVEL, AND SUBSEQUENT DISABLING OFTHE PROGRESS OF THE SHUNT DEVICE BY STOPPING THE VARIABLE TRANSFORMER IN THE COMBINATION: VARIABLE TRANSFORMER, FIXED TRANSFORMER, FIXED CAPACITOR. DURING NORMAL OPERATION THE SUPPRESSING REACTOR IS BYPASSED BY A SHUNT CIRCUIT WHICH INCLUDES A CONTACTOR. WHEN SUPPRESSION IS REQUIRED, THE SHUNT CONTACTOR IS OPENED AFTER DISABLING THE VARIABLE TRANSFORMER WHICH INSERTS THE SUPPRESSING REACTOR INTO THE MAIN CIRCUIT. FROM THIS MOMENT ON, THE PROGRESS OF THE VARIABLE TRANSFORMER IS REINSTATED AND CURRENT REACHES THE DESIRED OPTIMUM VALUE.

YET, TALL BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES SUCH AS THE JOHN HANCOCK BUILDING IN BOSTON AND THE CN TOWER IN TORONTO, WERE EQUIPPED WITH TUNED DAMPER SYSTEMS BY FOLLOWING STATE-OF-THE ART TECHNOLOGY, LEADING IN BOTH CASESTO EXPENSIVE SYSTEMS. IN DISCUSSIONS WITH CHARLES N. TSECKARES, AIA, OF THE ARCHITECT FIRM OF THE SAME NAME, IT APPEARS THAT THE REQUIRED RETROFIT OF NEWLY-ERECTED TALL STRUCTURES AND BUILDINGS, SUCH AS MENTIONED ABOVE, IS AN AREA THAT REQUIRES RESEARCH - ESPECIALLY IF IT IS DIRECTED TO THE COST-REDUCTION FOR SUCH SYSTEMS. MR. TSECKARES WILL PROVIDEADVICE TO THIS PROJECT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE ARCHITECT. THIS FIRST PHASE STUDY WILL EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF SANDAMPER TECHNOLOGY AS APPLIED TO THE DAMPING OF TALL BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES.

THE RESULTS ARE LOW INTERLAMINAR SHEAR STRENGTH AND LOW TRANSVERSE TENSILE STRENGTH OF THE FIBER. OXIDATIVE ETCHINGS AND COATINGS HAVE PROVEN MOST EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING THE BOND STRENGTH, BUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH PRIMARY CHEMICAL BONDS HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED REMAINS QUESTIONABLE. THE TREND TO HIGHER PERFORMANCE GRAPHITE FIBERS AGGRAVATES THE BONDING PROBLEM. SURFACE CHEMICAL MODIFICATION OF POLYARAMID FILAMENTS, INDUCED BY GLOW DISCHARGE PLASMA TREATING, HAS BEEN HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN MODIFYING THE SURFACE ENERGETICS TO ENHANCE WETTING AND DEPOSITING REACTIVE GROUPS WHICH CAN FORM COVALENT BONDS WITH THE RESIN. THE RESULT HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN OFF-AXIS PROPERTIES OF KEVLAR/EPOXY COMPOSITES. THE FEASIBILITY OF MODIFYING THE SURFACE CHEMISTRY OF GRAPHIC FIBERS WITH GLOW DISCHARGE PLASMA TREATMENT PROCESS TO INCREASE CHEMICAL BONDS WITH RESINS WILL BE INVESTIGATED.TWO CARBON FIBERS AND TWO EPOXY RESINS WILL BE STUDIED WITH AMMONIA AS THE SOURCE GAS.

THE PCGPAK IS CURRENTLY BEING MARKETED AND IS THE RESULT OF INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT WORK IMPLEMENTING TECHNIQUES FOR ITERATIVE SOLUTION OF SPARSE SYSTEMS DEVELOPED BY RESEARCHERS IN ACADEMIA. PCGPAK REPRESENTS A STATE-OF- THE-ART SOFTWARE TOOL FOR SEQUENTIAL PROCESSING ARCHITEC- TURES, AND ITS MODIFICATION FOR VECTOR PROCESSING EN VIRONMENTS SUCH AS THE CRAY-1 AND CDC CYBER 205 WOULD REPRESENT A MAJOR ADVANCE IN THE SOPHISTICATION AND EFFICIENCY OF SOLUTION TECHNIQUES AVAILABLE ON SUPERCOMPUTERS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH WILL BE TO PORT THE CURRENT FORTRAN 77 VERSION OF PCGPAK TO TWO VECTOR PROCESSING SUPERCOMPUTERS: THE CRAY-1 AND THE CYBER 205. THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PRECONDITIONED ITERATIVE ALGORITHMS IN THE VECTOR PROCESSING ENVIRONMENT WILL THEN BE EVALUATED, AND THE MODIFICATION PROCESS OF THOSE ALGORITHMS FOR OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE IN THESE MULTIPROCESSOR ENVIRONMENTS WILL BE BEGUN. THE NEXT STEP WILL BE TO INSTALL PCGPAK ON A VECTOR MULTIPORCESSOR COMPUTER, THE CRAY X/MP, AND BEGIN THE ANALYSIS OF ITS PERFORMANCE IN THE DISTINCTIVE PROCESSING ENVIRONMENT. THIS INSTALLATION WILL REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT HAND-TAILORING OF THE FORTAN CODE TO EXPLICITY SCHEDULE THE PARALLEL EXECUTION OF CODE SEGMENTS. AGAIN, THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS MODIFIED PCGPAK ON A SERIES OF STANDARD PROBLEMS WILL BE PROFILED AND ANALYZED, AND THE PROCESS OF OPTIMIZATION OF THE SERIAL ALGORITHMS FOR THIS ENVIRONMENT WILL BE BEGUN.",

THE METHODOLOGY WILL CONSIST OF PROCESSING THE STANDARD TAPE OFF-LINE USING A VAX 11/750 AND GENERATING TEST TAPES WITH VARIOUS SCHEMES USING PULSATILE CODES. THE TEST TAPES WILL BE PLAYED FOR SUBJECTS USING A BATTERY OPERATED RECORDER ELECTRICALLY COUPLED TO THE STIMULATING UNIT AND COUPLED THROUGH A STANDARD COIL TO THE ELECTRODE. THE MAJOR ASSUMPTION BEHIND THE CODING TECHNIQUES IS THAT THE ELECTRODE MUST BE DRIVEN PITCH SYNCHRONOUSLY FOR OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE.

SILICON COMPILER SOFTWARE SYSTEMS THAT LARGELY AUTOMATE THE VLSI DESIGN PROCESS ARE IN DEVELOPMENT. SILICON COMPILERS WILL INCREASE CIRCUIT COST PERFORMANCE, ALLOWING WIDESPREAD USE OF CUSTOM VLSIS IN MEDICAL EQUIPMENT.THE GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE THAT WILL PERMIT GENERAL USE OF CUSTOM VLSI IN MEDICAL APPLICATIONS. PHASE I RESEARCH WILL ADDRESS THE TWO MAJOR SILICON COMPILER IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED BEFORE COMPILERS CAN BE READILY USED TO DESIGN MEDICAL ELECTRONICS. FIRST, TECHNIQUES WILL BE DEVELOPED TO PLACE ANALOG, AS WELL AS DIGITAL, COMPONENTS ON A SINGLE VLSI CHIP. SECOND, METHODS FOR INCORPORATING ESTABLISHED SAFETY PROCEDURES INTO IN ADDITION TO THESE SOFTWARE PROJECTS, A TEAM OF MEDICAL CONSULTANTS WILL PRIORITIZE THOSE PRODUCTS THAT ARE MOST RELEVANT FOR VLSI CUSTOM CIRCUITS.

USING THIS TECHNOLOGY THE RSA IS INVARIABLY PRESENT AND ACCURATELY QUANTIFIABLE IN ALL INDIVIDUALS REGARDLESS OF AGE. ITS AMPLITUDE FALLS PREDICTABLY APPROXIMATELY 10% PER DECADE. INDIVIDUALS WITH A TRANSPLANTED HEART OR SEVERE DIABETIC NEUROPATHY HAVE RESTING RSA THAT IS NORMAL FOR AGE. THE SHAPE AND AMPLITUDE OF THE RSA DURING VOLUNTARY CARDIORESPIRATORY SYNCHRONIZATION (VCRS) MAY REFLECT THE COMPLIANCE OF THE HEART MUSCLE AND ITS RESPONSE TO RHYTHMICALLY CHANGING INTRATHORACIC VOLUME, PRESSURE, AND THE SUBSEQUENT EBB AND FLOW OF VENOUS RETURN. THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS OBJECTIVE QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE BIOLOGIC AGE OF THE HEART AND ALSO THE EFFECT OF ANY DRUG, DISEASE, OR BEHAVIOR THAT AFFECTS THE RSA. BOTH ACUTE AND CHRONIC-CUMULATIVE CARDIOTOXIC EFFECTS OF ANTHRACYCLINES ARE READILY MEASURED USING THIS DEVICE. RSA DISAPPEARS ACUTELY FOLLOWING INTRAVENOUS DOXORUBICIN ADMINISTRATION, AND GRADUALLY RETURNS TOWARD PRETREATMENT VALUES DURING THE 30 DAYS FOLLOWING DRUG ADMINISTRATION. AN IRREVERSIBLE PROGRESSIVE FALL-OFF OF RSA (AVERAGING 7% PER 60 MG/M2 DOSE) ALSO ACCOMPANIES INCREASING CUMULATIVE DOXORUBICIN DOSAGE. RSA IS INVARIABLY UNDETECTABLE IN PATIENTS WITH PROVEN DOXORUBICIN-INDUCED CARDIOMYOPATHY. DETERMINATION OF RSA BY THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY PERMITS INSTANTANEOUS, NONINVASIVE, QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION OF CARDIOTOXICITY INDUCED BY DOXORUBICIN. PHASE I WILL RESULT IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION OF A MANUFACTURABLE SINE-O-GRAPH RSA MONITOR WHICH MAY BE USED TO MEASURE THE RSA AND TO QUANTIFY DOXORUBICIN-INDUCED HEART DAMAGE. *U.S. PATENT GRANTED MAY 28, 1985.

IN PARTICULAR, SINCE SPHERICAL TESTPARTICLES OF KNOWN SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS ARE USED FOR CA CALIBRATION, THERE IS PRESENTLY NO KNOWN RELIABLE WAY TO OPTICALLY MEASURE THE IRREGULARLY SHAPED PARTICLES WHICH C COMMONLY OCCUR IN NATURE. PREVIOUS EFFORTS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SIMULTANEOUSLY OBSERVE PARTICLES AS THEY APPEARED INTHE COUNTER'S SAMPLE VOLUME, SO THERE WAS NO WAY TO DETERMINE THE COUNTER'S SAMPLE VOLUME, SO THERE WAS NO WAY TO DETERMINE THE COUNTER'S RESPONSE TO DIFFERENT PORTIONS OF THE DEPTH OF FIELD. THIS PROJECT WILL UTILIZE HOLOGRAPHIC TECHNIQUES WHICH WILL ALLOW NEW THREE DD DIMENSIONAL VISUALIZATIONS OF PARTICLES AS THEY PASS THROUGHA COUNTER'S TEST VOLUME. THE CHIEF OBJECTIVE OF THIS P PROJECT IS TO SIMULTANEOUSLY EXAMINE PARTICLES WITH A HOLOGRAPHIC SYSTEM AND A SELECTED PARTICLE MEASURING SYSTEMS CORPORATION PARTICLE COUNTER. AN ASSESSMENT WILL BE MADE OF THE POTENTIAL OF HOLOGRAPHY TO FUNCTION AS I IMPROVED CALIBRATION TECHNIQUES FOR OPTICAL COUNTERS. THESEOBJECTIVES WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY SLAVING A HOLOGRAPHIC SY SYSTEM TO A SELECTED COMMERCIAL PROBE AND OPERATING BOTH INSTRUMENTS IN A MEDIUM SPEED WIND TUNNEL. THE POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION AS DESCRIBED BY THE AWARDEE: THE PRIMARY COMMERCIAL APPLICATION OF THIS WORK WILL BE IN POLLUTION MEASUREMENTS. AEROSOLS MAKE UP AN EXTREMELY I IMPORTANT PART OF ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTANTS, AND ACCURATE MEASUREMENT IS ESSENTIAL FOR COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS SEEKING TO COMPLY WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. IT IS ,THEREFORE, ANTICIPATED THAT THERE WILL BE EXTENSIVE APPLI- CATION FOR THIS WORK IN HEAVY INDUSTRIES. AS SUCH MEAS MEASUREMENTS ARE ALSO REQUIRED BY THOSE ATTEMPTING TO E ENFORCE SUCH LAWS, USE WILL ALSO BE MADE OF THIS WORK BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

IT IS EXPECTED THAT UNDER PHASE I, THE TECHNIQUE WILL BE DEVELOPED INCLUDING BOTH THE SOFTWARE AND BRASSBOARD HARDWARE. A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT EXPERIMENT WILL THEN FOLLOW.

CURRENTLY, THERE IS NO EQUIPMENT COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE FOR LEVELS WITHOUT GOING THROUGH SOME MAJOR HARDWARE MODIFIC- CATIONS. THIS PROPOSAL IS SPECIALLY AIMED AT THIS POINT TO DEVELOP A REAL-TIME COMPLEX IMPEDANCE MEASURING/TRACKING SYSTEM THAT CAN BE USED IN HIGH POWER LEVELS E.G.1 KW TO 10KW,CW, OR PULSED. THE PROPOSED WORK IS DERIVED FOR THE RESULT OF AN NSF-SUPPORTED PROJECT, \"A NOVEL MICROWAVE AUTOMATIC IMPEDANCE MEASUREMENT SYSTEM, ECS-8118880. \"THIS PROJECT WAS ALREADY SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED. THREE JOURNAL PAPERS (IEEE-MTT) AND SEVEN CONFERENCE PAPERS WERE PUBLISHED. THE THEORY OF THIS NOVEL SYSTEM IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE SIX-PORT ANA SYSTEMS, BUT BOTH WERE DEVELOPED QUITE INDEPENDENTLY IN THE PAST. BECAUSE OF THE SIMPLICITY OF THE THEORY, IT IS POSSIBLE FOR US TO REALIZE THE DESIGN BY USINGONLY ANALOG DEVICES. THE EXPERIMENT IS COMPLETED AND THE PERFORMANCES WERE CHECKED AT LOW POWER LEVELS (10MW). THE PHASE I OF THE PROPOSAL IS AIMED AT THE FEASIBILITY OF USINGTHIS SYSTEM AT HIGH POWER LEVELS, FOR EXAMPLE, IKW TO 10 KW.THE POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION AS DESCRIBED BY THE AWARDEE: RESEARCH WILL BE APPLIED TO MEASURING AND TRACKING REAL TIME THE CHANGES OF THE COMPLEX IMPEDANCE OF ANY MICRO WAVE LOAD EXCITED AT HIGH POWER LEVELS.

IN THIS APPROACH, A THIN LAYER OF MATERIAL (FOR EXAMPLE, BORON) IS ION- SPUTTERED ONTO A SURFACE THAT IS CONCURRENTLY IM- PLANTED WITH A STEADY BEAM OF IONS (FOR EXAMPLE, NOTROGEN). THE COATINGS SYNTHESIZED BY THIS TECHNIQUE (FOR EXAMPLE, I-BN) ARE EXPECTED NOT ONLY TO BE EXTREMELY HARD AND WEAR-RESISTANT BUT TO TRANSFORM TO A SELF-LUBRICATING FORM UNDER LOAD. THIS TECHNIQUE IS EXPECTED TO BE USEFUL FOR DEPOSITION OF DIAMOND- LIKE COATINGS SUCH AS I-CARBON AND I-BORON NITRIDE AND ALSO SUCH REFRACTORY MATERIALS AS B4C, TIN, TIC AND TIB2.",

THE TECHNIQUE PROPOSED FOR THIS SBIR UTILIZES A RADAR TRANSMITTER AND AN INTERFEROMETRIC RECEIVER TO DETERMINE THE PRECISE LINE OF SIGHT AND RANGE TO EACH SONOBUOY. POSITION ACCURACIES OF LESS THAN 1 METER SHOULD BE ACHIEVABLE. MANY SONOBUOYS CAN BE TRACKED WITH THE SAME TRACKING SYSTEM. THESE SONOBUOYS WOULD NEED NO OCEAN REFERENCE; THEREFORE, THEY COULD BE DEPLOYED OVER THE OCEAN IMPACT AREA FROM AN AIRCRAFT OR A SHIP WITHIN RF RANGE OF THE SHORE TRACKING SYSTEM. THE PRIMARY EFFORT DURING THIS PHASE I STUDY IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF THE PROPOSED SONOBUOY TRACKING SYSTEM. TRADEOFF ANALYSES WILL BE CONDUCTED TO DEFINE THE BEST CONCEPT. THE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS AND PERFORMANCE WILL BE DETERMINED IN SUFFICIENT DETAIL TO PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR A PHASE II PROOF OF CONCEPT DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM.

THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED BY DESIGNING A SERIES OF MINIATURIZED (100MM) OR SUBMIMIATURE (LESS THAN 25 MM) FIBER OPTIC CHEMICAL SENSORS (FOCS, OR \"OPTRODE\") FOR WATER VAPOR, OXYGEN, AND CARBON DIOXIDE. THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY USING REMOTE FIBER FLUORIMETRY, A NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT INTEGRATES FIBER OPTICS, LASERS, CHEMISTRY, AND SPECTROSCOPY. THE KEY TO THIS APPROACH IS THE FOCS, A FIBER OPTIC WITH A CHEMICALLY REACTIVE TIP AT ITS DISTAL END. PROPER SELECTION OF FOCS CHEMISTRY PROVIDES SENSITIVE, SPECIFIC SENSORS. THE NEW METHOD HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF IN-SITU MONITORING OF THE MICRO \"RESPIRATION\" (GAS EXCHANGE) PROCESSES OF LEAVES, ROOTS AND OTHER ORGANS IN THIER IMMEDIATE BOUNDARY SURROUNDINGS. THE FOCS ALSO WILL BE MINIATURIZED FOR INSERTION INTO TISSUES OF LIVING PLANTS WITH NEGLIGIBLE OR MINIMUM EFFEECTS ON THE NATURAL PROCESSES. BY THE END OF PHASE I, THE FEASIBILITY OF FOCS TECHNOLOGY ADDRESSING PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH PHOTOSYNTHESIS PHYSIOLOGY THAT ARE BEYOND THE STATE-OF-THE-ART CHEMICAL ANALYSIS TECHNOLOGY WILL BE ESTABLISHED. THE LONG-RANGE OBJECTIVE AND BEBEFIT OF THIS PROGRAM WILL BE TO MONITOR THE EXCHANGE OF PHOTOSYNTHETICALLY IMPORTANT GASES AND TO VERIFY IMPORTANT ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT TIER TRANSPORT WITHIN PLANTS.

IT IS SPECIFICALLY DIRECTED AT REDUCING THE BROMINE-INDUCED STRUCTURAL DEFORMATION OR WARPAGE WHICH OCCURS IN BIPOLAR PLASTIC BONDED CARBON ELECTRODE DUE TO VOLUME CHANGES AS A RESULT OF SIGNIFICANT BROMINE ABSORPTION INTO THE BIPOLAR PLATE. THE PROPOSED APPROACH IS BASED ON THE USE OF BORON AS A DOPANT WHICH IS SUBSTITUTIONALLY INTRODUCED INTO THE CARBON LATTICE. SUCH BORON DOPING AT RATHER LOW LEVELS (< 1 ATOM PERCENT) LOWERS THE FERMI LEVEL OF THE CARBON AND THIS LOWERING OF THE FERMILEVEL STRONGLY INHIBITS BROMINE ABSORPTION AND THEREFORE SHOULD REDUCE ELECTRODE WARPAGE. THE PROGRAM OBJECTIVES ARETO: 1. EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF BORON DOPING OF DIFFERENT CARBONSON THEIR BROMINE ABSORPTION. 2. DETERMINE THE ABILITY OF BORON-DOPED, PLASTIC-BONDED CARBON ELECTRODES MATERIALS TO RESIST WARPAGE IN A BROMINE ENVIRONMENT. 3. ESTABLISH THAT BORON-DOPING OF THE CARBON PLASTIC MATERIAL DOES NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT ZINC-BROMINE CELL ELECTROCHEMICAL BEHAVIOR.",

THE LACK OF SIMPLE, CLINICALLY USEFUL TECHNIQUES FOR PRE- OR INTRAOPERATIVE LOCALIZATION OF PARATHYROID TISSUE IS ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT PROBLEMS IN THE SURGICAL MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WITH PARATHYROID DISEASE. VARIATIONS IN THE POSITIONS OF THE PARATHYROID GLANDS IN THE NECK AND IN THE SUPERIOR MEDIASTINUM AND THE CLOSE RELATIONSHIP OF THE GLANDS TO THE RECURRENT LARYNGEAL NERVE MAKE SURGERY DIFFICULT. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP RADIOLABELED ANTIBODIES WHICH CAN BE USED FOR THE IN VIVO DETECTION AND LOCALIZATION OF PARATHYROID TISSUE IN PATIENTS WHO ARE CANDIDATES FOR SURGERY. IN PHASE I, WE PROPOSE TO PREPARE ANTIBODIES TO HUMAN PARATHYROID HORMONE (HPTH) AND TO DETERMINE IF THESE ANTIBODIES LOCALIZE IN PARATHYROID LESIONS OF ARCHIVED, PARAFFIN-EMBEDDED TUMOR SPECIMENS. IN PHASE II, A RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL FOR PARATHYROID IMAGING WILL BE DESIGNED UTILIZING ANTIBODIES DEFINED IN PHASE I.

THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THIS STUDY ARE: 1. THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONTACT SAPPHIRE CERAMIC PROBES, 2. FIBER OPTIC CONNECTING CABLES FOR DELIVERY OF LASER ENERGY TO PROBE, AND 3. TO STUDY THE TISSUE EFFECTS OF CONTACT LASER SURGERY IN RABBIT EYES, BOTH CLINICALLY AND HISTOLOGICALLY. DELIVERY OF ND:YAG AND ARGON LASER ENERGY WITH SAPPHIRE CERAMIC PROBE BY DIRECT CONTACT WITH TUMOR TISSUE RESULTS IN MORE ACCURATE PLACEMENT OF ENERGY (DEPTH AND LATERAL PENETRATION) PRODUCING LESS SURROUNDING TISSUE DAMAGE AND 75% LESS ENERGY NECESSARY THAN NONCONTACT DELIVERY. THE CONTACT SAPPHIRE CERAMIC PROBES WILL BE DEVELOPED AND FABRICATED BY SLT, JAPAN. THE LAUNCH OPTICS AND CONNECTING CABLES WILL BE DEVELOPED AND FABRICATED BY SLT, USA. THE SURGICAL APPLICATION AND TISSUE EFFECTS IN RABBITS WILL BE STUDIED BY CONSULTANTS AT THE WILLS EYE HOSPITAL. THE RESULTS OF THIS WILL ENABLE US TO GO TO PHASE II FOR EXPERIMENTAL REMOVAL OF UVEAL TUMORS IN RABBITS AND EVENTUALLY, WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE STUDY, FOR TREATMENT IN HUMANS.

IT IS PRESUMED THAT INFORMED MOTORISTS WILL AVOID DRIVING WHILE DRUNK (E.G., BAC 0.10) GIVEN APPROPRIATE DRINKING GUIDELINES, AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS PHASE I APPROACH IS TO CONSOLIDATE AVAILABLE RESEARCH RESULTS AND SPECIFY THOSE VARIABLES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO ACCURATELY PREDICT BAC GIVEN ALCOHOL DOSAGE LEVELS, FOOD INTAKE, AND OTHER SUBJECT RELATED VARIABLES. PERTINENT RESEARCH WILL BE INCORPORATED THROUGH LITERATURE REVIEW, ANALYSIS OF AVAILABLE DATABASES, AND DISCUSSION WITH OTHER KNOWLEDGEABLE RESEARCHERS. PRELIMINARY BAC PREDICTIVE EQUATIONS WILL BE DEVELOPED THAT CAN BE TESTED IN A PHASE II EXPERIMENT TO BE DESIGNED AS PART OF THIS PHASE I EFFORT. A NOVEL FEATURE OF THE PHASE II EXPERIMENTAL PLAN IS TO INCLUDE PERFORMANCE TESTS WHICH CAN BE USED TO DETERMINE THE IMPORTANCE OF BAC PREDICTION ERRORS. IF LOW BACS ARE PREDICTED FOR INDIVIDUALS WHOSE PERFORMANCE IS NOT SERIOUSLY IMPAIRED BY ALCOHOL, THEN THE ERRORS MAY BE BENIGN. IF LOW BACS ARE PREDICTED FOR SERIOUSLY IMPAIRED PERFORMERS, HOWEVER, THEN THESE ERRORS MUST BE CONSIDERED QUITE SIGNIFICANT, AND MAY REQUIRE MORE CONSERVATIVE GUIDELINES. THESE EFFORTS COULD RESULT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE USEFUL DRINKING GUIDELINES WITH A RANGE OF FUTURE FORMATS FROM CHARTS AND MONOGRAMS TO ELECTRONIC ESTIMATORS AND COMPUTER PROGRAMS.",

THE CERMET WILL PRODUCE A CASTABLE AND RECASTABLE MATERIAL THAT RETAINS THE DESIRABLE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF BULK GOLD SUCH AS CORROSIONPROTECTION AND LOW ELECTRICAL CONTACT RESISTANCE BUT WITH IMPROVED PROPERTIES SUCH AS HARDNESS AND COLD FLOW, AND HAS THE ADDITONAL BENEFIT OF USING 30% LESS GOLD. THE PRINCIPAL GOAL IS TO PRODUCE SLUGS OF COMPRESSED GOLD- SILICA POWDER THAT CAN BE USED TO EXTEND GOLD/GOLD ALLOY ALLOY MELTS. THE RESULTANT GOLD CERMETS WILL HAVE A FULLY WETTED, DISPERSED SILICA CONTENT OF 20% TO 30% BY VOLUME.

TEGERIS LABORATORIES PROPOSES TO COMBINE BOTH PRODRUG MODIFICATION AND SUITABLE FORMULATION VEHICLES TO SOLVE THE SOLUBILITY AND STABILITY PROBLEMS.

IT IS PROPOSED THAT FURTHER RESEARCH BE DONE ON A METHOD OF COMBINING THE EROSION RESISTANCE OF FLUOROPOLYMERS WITH THE DESIRABLE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF CONVENTIONAL COMPOSITE MATERIALS. THIS CAN BE DONE BY CHEMICALLY MODIFYING THE EXISTING MOLECULES IN THE OUTERMOST SURFACE LAYER OF THE MATERIAL RATHER THAN COATING IT, THUS AVOIDING DELAMINATION PROBLEMS.

THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY TREATING THE OIL AS A LOSSY DIELECTRIC ACAND PLACING A TRANSDUCER IN THE OIL. BOTH CONDUCTANCE AND SUSCEPTANCE ON APPROPRIATE FREQUENCIES ARE MEASURED AND THEIR RATIO, THE DISSIPATION FACTOR, IS USED AS AN INDICATOROF THE CONDITION OF THE OIL. AS THE LEVEL OF METALLIC AND IONIZATION GROW THE DISSIPATION FACTOR INCREASES WHICH IS THEN CORRELATED WITH THE CONDITION OF THE ENGINE. THE IN VESTIGATION WILL INCLUDE PLACEMENT OF AN ANODE IN THE CAPACITANCE PROBE. THIS WILL ALLOW US TO CORRELCORRELATE THEPRESENCE OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID IONIZATION IN THE OIL. A LOW -POWER DIGITAL TRANSMITTER WILL SEND SIGNALS TO A NEARBY DEMODULATOR RECEIVER UNIT WHICH RECORDS AND DISPLAYS THE NECESSARY DATA. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYSTEM WILL PROVIDE THE OPERATORS MASS TRANSIT SYSTEM AND OTHER ENGINES WITH AN ON-LINE SYSTEM THAT CONTINUOUSLY MONITORS THE CONDITION OF THEIR TRANSMISSIONS AND ENGINES.

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE DOPING EFFICIENCY OF BORON IN SILICON SOLAR CELLS IS LIMITED BY THE PRESENCE OF OXYGEN WHICH FORMS A COMPLEX WITH BORON. SPECIFICALLY, THE INTERSTITIAL BORON-INTERSTITIAL OXYGEN DEFECT STRUCTURE IS CREATED WHEN THE BORON CONCENTRATION IS IN THE RANGE OF 5 X 10 14 TO 2 X 10 16 ATOMS/CM3 IN CONJUNCTION WITH AN OXYGEN CONCENTRATION OF 4 X 10 16 TO 3 X 10 17 ATOMS/ CM3. THE MAXIMUM DEFECT CONCENTRATION REPORTED BY DREVINSKY AND DE ANGELIS IS 4 X 10 13 ATOMS/CM3 WHICH INDICATED THAT ONLY ONE IN A THOUSAND OXYGEN ATOMS WILL COMPLEX WITH BORON. THE INTERSTITIAL BORON-INTERSTITIAL OXYGEN MINORITY CARRIER TRAP CAN NOT BE ELIMINATED UNLESS ALL THE INTERSTITIAL OXYGEN ATOMS ARE REMOVED OR TRAPPED. HEAT TREATMENT AT 650 DEGREES TO 800 DEGREES CELSIUS FOR 20 HOURS OR 1000 DEGREES CELSIUS FOR 20 HOURS WILL PRODUCE OXYGEN AGGLOMERATES THAT WILL TRAP INTERSTITIAL OXYGEN ATOMS. THIS REDUCES THE NUMBER OF INTERSTITIAL OXYGEN ATOMS WHICH WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO COMPLEX WITH BORON. THE ADVANTAGE OF THIS TECHNIQUE IS THAT NO IMPURITIES HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE SILICON THAT COULD REDUCE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE SOLAR CELL. MOST OTHER HEAT-TREATMENT PROCEDURES COULD BE USED SUB- SEQUENTLY IN PROCESSING THE SOLAR CELL AND NOT DESTROY THE INERT OXYGEN COMPLEX. THE NEWLY CREATED OXYGEN COMPLEX IS VERY STABLE; ONLY HEAT TREATMENT AT 1350 DEGREES CELSIUS WOULD CAUSE DISASSOCIATION.",

THE GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP AN EFFECTIVE, NONINVASIVE HYPERTHERMIA SYSTEM CAPABLE OF LOCALLY HEATING A WIDE VARIETY OF CANCER TUMORS LOCATED ON OR DEEP WITHIN (10 CM) THE BODY. PROPOSED IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SYSTEM THAT FEATURES A NOVEL TREATMENT APPLICATOR WITH THE ABILITY TO DYNAMICALLY VARY BOTH THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DEPOSITION OF ULTRASONIC ENERGY IN RESPONSE TO MEASURED TEMPERATURE DATA. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY SIMULTANEOUSLY CONTROLLING, IN REAL TIME, THE ACOUSTIC FREQUENCY, POWER OUTPUT, APERTURE, AND FOCAL LENGTH OF A PROPRIETARY ULTRASOUND TRANSDUCER(S); THE POSITION AND ORIENTATION OF THE TRANSDUCER(S); AND THE TEMPERATURE OF A WATER BATH THROUGH WHICH THE ENERGY IS TRANSMITTED PHASE I OF THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM BY MODELING ITS HEATING PERFORMANCE WHEN APPLIED TO A NUMBER OF CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT SITUATIONS.

THE PROPOSED DETECTION TECHNIQUESMAY BE BETTER THAN RADAR FOR DETECTING DANGEROUS TURBULENT AND ELECTRIFIED REGIONS UNDER SOME CONDITIONS (LITTLE OR NO RAIN), CAN SEE THROUGH CLOUDS WITH MUCH RAIN (WHICH BLOCK RADAR), HAS LONGER RANGE THAN RADAR, AND CAN BE MOUNTED ON AIRCRAFT AND HELICOPTERS WHERE THERE MAY BE NO NOSE CONE AVAILABLE FOR A RADAR ANTENNA. ELECTRIC FIELDS WILL BE OBSERVED WITH SIMPLE CORONA CURRENT INSTRUMENTATION SINCE AIRCRAFT CAN TRIGGER LIGHTNING. LIGHTNING WILL BE MAPPED WITH AN INTERFEROMETER. THUS, THE PREAND POST-LIGHTNING AS WELL AS THE LIGHTNING PHASES OF A STORM WILL BE COVERED. THERE WILL BE COCKPIT DISPLAYS FOR THE ELECTRIC FIELD VECTOR, LIGHTNING POSITION AND SFERIC RATE. PRELIMINARY TESTING OF A CORONA SYSTEM HAS ALREADY BEEN ACCOMPLISHED ON OUR UNIQUE ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRIC RESEARCH AIRCRAFT. THE LIGHTNING INTERFEROMETER HAS BEEN PROVEN FOR DIRECTIONAL SENSING ON THE GROUND; THIS PROGRAM WILL EXTEND THE TECHNOLOGY TO AIRCRAFT INCLUDING SINGLE-STATION-RANGING.",

THE AMERICAN SWINE DIET IS EXPECTED TO EVALUATE THE LACTOBACILLUS SUPPLEMENT FOR POSSIBLE REDUCTION OF SERUM CHOLESTEROL AND LIPOPROTEINS IN HUMANS. SUBSEQUENT PHASES OF RESEARCH ARE PLANNED FOR DETERMINING THE OPTIMUM TIME FOR FEEDING LACTOBACILLUS SUPPLEMENTS TO PIGS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF HUMAN FOODS.

THEGOAL OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO ACHIEVE LASER ACTION IN THE DIATOMIC SELENIUM MOLECULE IN A RARE GAS DISCHARGE AFTERGLOW ENVIRONMENT AND TO OBSERVE THE FORMATION AND QUENCHING OF OTHER SELENIUM SPECIES IN THE AFTERGLOW USING SPECTROSCOPIC TECHNIQUES. THE BROADBAND GAIN AND LASING CHARACTERISTICS OF THE GROUP VIB HOMONUCLEAR DIATOMIC SPECIES CAN LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENTOF LONG LIFE, RELIABLE SEALED TUNABLE LASER SYSTEMS TO REPLACE DYE LASERS IN HIGH AVERAGE POWER INDUSTRIAL SYSTEMS.",

ON THE OTHER HAND, PURELY MATHEMATICAL APPROACHES BASED ON THE GEOMETRY OF THE INTERSECTING SHAPES ARE FAR TOO RESTRICTED IN THEIR DOMAIN OF APPLICATION BECAUSE OF THEIR SHAPE-SPECIFIC FORMULATION. THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THE NEED TO COMBINE THE TWO APPROACHES INTO A SINGLE METHODOLOGY FOR INTERSECTION OF ARBITRARY SHAPES IN FINITE DIMENSIONAL SPACES. THE APPROACH TAKEN MAKES USE OF RESULTS RELATING TO THE TOPOLOGY AND GEOMETRY OF THE INTERSECTION OF TWO SUBMANIFOLDS THAT MEET CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONAL REQUIREMENTS.

THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF PHASE I ARE TO OBTAIN INFORMATION CONCERNING THE: 1.MINIMUM LEVEL OF IMMUNOGEN REQUIRED FOR AN IMMUNE RESPONSE5.IMMUNE RESPONSE TOWARD SMALL PEPTIDES ADSORBED TO NITROCELLULOSE. PHASE II RESEARCH WILL INVOLVE AN EXPANDED INVESTIGATION OF THE METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH DEVELOPED IN PHASE I, ESPECIALLY IN THE AREA OF PEPTIDE IMMUNOGENS. ALSO, ANTIBODIES OF COMMERCIAL VALUE WILL BE DEVELOPED AGAINST HUMAN PROTEINS AVAILABLE TO ZYMOGENETICS WHICH HAVE DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC VALUE. THE SUCCESS OF THIS WORK WILL PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO BIOTECHNOLOGY AND HUMAN HEALTH CARE.",

IN THIS CONCEPT A PULSED CO2 LASER OPERATING FROM A REMOTE PLATFORM IN AIR IS FOCUSED ON ICE TO GENERATE AN ACOUSTIC FIELD HAVING RELATIVELY FLAT FREQUENCY SPECTRUM OUT TO 100KHZ. A MICROPHONE ALSO LOCATED IN AIR DETECTS THE SOUND RELECTED FROM THE ICE/WATER INTERFACE. PRECISE TIMING OF THESE SIGNALS MAKES IT POSSIBLETO ACCURATELY MEASURE THE ICE THICKNESS. INITIAL ICE FIELD MEASUREMENTS PROVED THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS CONCEPT FOR MEASURING 1 METER THICK ICE. THE EMPHASIS OF THE PROPOSED PROGRAM IS TO INVESTIGATE THE BASIC AND SYSTEM PARAMETERS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO DEVELOP THIS CONCEPT INTO AN AIRBORNE REMOTE SYSTEM FOR MEASURING ICE THICKNESS OF SEVERAL METERS TO A RESOLUTION OF 0.25-0.5 METERS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SUCH A SYSTEM COULD BE USED IN A STAND-ALONE MODE, OR IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER \"ICE SENSORS\" TO ACCOMPLISH THE DESIRED DEPTH RESOLUTION AND WIDE AREA COVERAGE FOR ROUTINE SURVEILLANCE OF ICE THICKNESS.",
