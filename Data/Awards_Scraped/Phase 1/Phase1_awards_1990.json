THE SHARING OF REDUNDANT HARDWARE TO PROVIDE FAULT TOLERANCE IS COMMON ON FLIGHT CRITICAL AND LIFE THREATENING AVIONICS APPLICATIONS. THE DIFFERENCE IN THIS INVESTIGATION IS TO EXPLORE THE SHARING OF THE INERTIAL INSTRUMENTS FROM WITHIN MULTIPLE DISPERSED INERTIAL SYSTEMS. ABACUS PROGRAMMING CORPORATION IS PROPOSING TO INVESTIGATE THE DEGRADATION OF NAVIGATION PERFORMANCE IN A DISPERSED INERTIAL NAVIGATION SYSTEM (BEFORE AND) AFTER FAILURE OF NAVIGATION INSTRUMENTS. ABACUS IS PROPOSING A BROAD SYSTEMS ENGINEERING APPROACH TO DIENTIFY THE DRIVING PARAMETERS INVOLVED IN A DISPERSED SENSOR SYSTEM. CONSIDERATION IS MADE NOT ONLY OF THE DISPERSAL OF CONVENTIONAL INS BOXES, BUT THE ABACUS INNOVATIVE APPROACH ALSO INCLUDES THE BROADER QUESTION OF THE ORIENTATION OF DISPERSED/PACKAGED SENSORS TO BALANCE THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS TO MINIMIZE THE PERFORMANCE DEGRADATION. THE TYPES OF DEGRADATION CONSIDERED INCLUDE NAVIGATION ACCURACY AND THE SENSITIVITY TO FAILURE DETECTION/CORRECTION AND FALSE ALARMS. THE INVESTIGATION WILL INCLUDE BOTH PLATFORM AND STRAPDOWN INS CONFIGURATIONS. THERE WILL BE INSTANCES WHERE THERE ARE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PLATFORM AND STRAPDOWN CONFIGURATIONS.",

THIS PROJECT DESCRIBES AN INNOVATIVE VARIATION OF XRF THAT CAN PROVIDE AN IMPROVEMENT IN PRECISION OF ONE TO TWO ORDERSOF MAGNITUDE OVER PRESENT TECHNOLOGY. THIS IS ACHIEVED BY REDUCING THE BACKGROUND UNDER THE SIGNAL BY A FACTOR OF 10 MILLION, WHILE REDUCING THE SIGNAL ITSELF BY ONLY 100. PHASE I WILL PROVE THE FEASIBILITY OF THE APPROACH. THREE TO FOUR MILLION YOUNG CHILDREN FROM ALL LEVELS OF SOCIETY ARE EXPOSED TO ENVIRONMENTAL SOURCES OF LEAD AT CONCENTRATIONS THAT PLACE THEM AT RISK OF ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS. MERCURY IS UBIQUITOUS. MANY FOODS, ESPECIALLY SEAFOODS, CONTAIN SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF MERCURY, AND THERE ARE OVER 100 INDEPENDENT OCCUPATIONS WITH POSSIBLE EXPOSURESTO LEAD OR MERCURY.

THE OPTIMIZATION OF TIMING IS CURRENTLY HANDLED MANUALLY, DELEGATED TO A PUMP TECHNICIAN OR PERFUSIONIST, AND IS UPDATED ANYWHERE FROM SEVERAL TIMES AN HOUR TO CONTINUOUSLY. THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE USES THE ARTERIAL PRESSURE WAVEFORM TO MONITOR PERFORMANCE. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN, HOWEVER, THAT THERE IS AN OPTIMAL TIME FOR THE BEGINNING OF INFLATION AND DEFLATION, AND THAT THIS TIME IS RELATED TO THE OPENING AND CLOSING OF HEART VALVES. THIS RESEARCH IS AIMED AT DEVELOPING A SYSTEM THAT UTILIZES PHONOCARDIOGRAPHIC HEART SOUNDS S1 AND S2 FOR TIMING REFERENCES IN THE CARDIAC CYCLE AND CONTROLS AN IABP AUTOMATICALLY THEREFROM. THE SYSTEM WOULD USE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE TO DETECT S1 AND S2 AND SET THE TIMING OF THE IABP ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS, THEREBY PROVIDING SUPERIOR THERAPY WITH A LOWER REQUIREMENT FOR PROFESSIONAL INTERVENTION. A PROTOTYPE SYSTEM WILL BE BUILT AND TESTED IN VIVO, COMPARING ITS TIMING TO THAT SET BY AN EXPERIENCED CLINICIAN.

STRUCTURAL ANALYSES AND WIND-TUNNEL TESTS HAVE SHOWN THAT, COMPARED TO CANTILEVER WINGS, JOINED WINGS ARE LIGHTER, STIFFER, AND HAVE HIGHER SPAN-EFFICIENCY FACTORS, GIVING LOWER INDUCED DRAG. THE PROPOSED STUDY INVESTIGATES THE APPLICATION OF JOINED WINGS TO VERY HIGH ALTITUDE SUBSONIC AIRCRAFT DESIGNED TO FLY ABOVE 100,000 FEET ALTITUDE. SUCH AIRCRAFT MUST OPERATE NEAR THE DRAG DIVERGENCE MACH NUMBER, WHILE GENERATING HIGH LIFT COEFFICIENTS. FOR SUCH FLIGHT CONDITIONS THIN SUPERCRITICALAIRFOILS ARE DESIRABLE. CANTILEVER WINGS EMPLOYING SUCH THIN AIRFOILS TEND TO BE HEAVY AND/OR EXCESSIVELY FLEXIBLE. FOR JOINED WINGS, HOWEVER, REDUCING THICKNESS/CHORD RATIO GIVES ONLY SMALL PENALTIES IN STRUCTURAL WEIGHT AND RIGIDITY. THE NET EFFECT IS THAT THE JOINED WING CAN INCREASE THE ALTITUDE AND PAYLOAD CAPABILITIES OF VERY HIGH ALTITUDE AIRCRAFT. THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL DELINEATE SUITABLE JOINED-WING CONFIGURATIONS, AND WILL SELECT ONE CONFIGURATION FOR DETAILED STRUCTURAL AND AERODYNAMIC INVESTIGATIONS.",

THE NEW SYSTEM SHOULD BE A NON-BARRIER TYPE FILTRATION DEVICE WITH THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTICS: VERY LOW PRESSURE DROP, REQUIRE LITTLE MAINTENANCE, BE INSENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN AMBIENT CONDITIONS SUCH AS TEMPERATURE, PRESSURE, AND MOISTURE, AND PROVIDE HIGH EFFICIENCY REMOVAL OF TOXIC GASES AND PARTICLES. ADA TECHNOLOGIES WILL DESIGN AND EVALUATE AN AIR CONTAIMINATION CONTROL SYSTEM FOR SHIPBOARD VENTILATION SYSTEMS USING AN ELECTROSTATICALLY ENHANCED ATOMIZED LIQUID SPRAY SYSTEM. SEVERAL CONFIGURATIONS OF THE CONCEPT WILL BE EVALUATED INCLUDING SINGLESTAGE AND TWO-STAGE PRECIPITATION AND PARTICLE PRECHARGING. THE ELECTROSTATIC ENHANCEMENT WILL PROVIDE THE COLLECTION MECHANISM REQUIRED TO EFFICIENTLY COLLECT PARTICLES IN THE 0.1 TO 1.0 MICRON RANGE THAT ARE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO COLLECT USING AN INERTIAL SPRAY SYSTEM. THIS SYSTEM ALLOWS USE OF NOZZLES DESIGNED TO PRODUCE A VERY FINE SPRAY TO OPTIMIZE THE SURFACE AREA FOR GAS REMOVAL. THE ELECTROSTATIC COLLECTOR ALSO ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR A HIGH PRESSURE DROP INERTIAL MIST ELIMINATOR.",

A PROTOTYPE SYSTEM WILL BE DESIGNED, FABRICATED, AND COMPLETELY TESTED IN THE LABORATORY. FOLLOWING THE LABORATORY EVALUATION, THE SYSTEM WILL BE MODIFIED AS NECESSARY TO PREPARE THE SYSTEM FOR FIELD USE. ONE IMPORTANT MODIFICATION WILL BE THE REDESIGN OF THE SMAPLE HEAD SO THAT IT MINIMALLY AFFECTS THE FLOW OF AIR CONTAINING THE TRACER GAS.

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE USE OF OPTICAL SYSTEMS IN HIGH SPEED SIGNAL PROCESSING APPLICATIONS IS DESTINED BECAUSE OF THE OVERWHELMING ADVANTAGES OF PARALLEL DATA TRANSMISSION. MANY APPLICATIONS REQUIRE NONLINEAR TRANSFORMATIONS TO BE PERFORMED IN PARALLEL AT HIGH SPEED AND RESOLUTION. THE USE OF ORGANIC MATERIALS WITH LARGE OPTICAL NONLINEARITIES IS PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE OF THEIR FAST RESPONSE, BROADBAND TRANSPARENCY IN THE NEAR INFRARED AND THE COMPATIBILITY WITH SI VLSI FABRICATION TECHNOLOGY. HOWEVER, HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION IS IMPOSSIBLE IF WAVEGUIDES ARE USED TO ACHIEVE THE REQUIRED OPTICAL THICKNESS. IN CONTRAST, HIGH LEVELS OF INTEGRATION CAN BE ACHIEVED WITH LIGHT AT NORMAL INCIDENCE IF HIGH FINESSE RESONATORS FILLED WITH NONLINER POLYMERS CAN BE DEVELOPED. THIS DEVICE STRUCTURE GIVES SUFFICIENT ENHANCEMENT OF THE OPTICAL FIELDS INSIDE THE NONLINEAR CAVITY TO ACHIEVE SUFFICIENT OPTICAL THICKNESS WITH 2 MICROMETER POLYMER FILMS. THE OBJECT OF PHASE I IS TO FABRICATE NOVEL, INTEGRATED, THIN-FILM, NONLINEAR FABRY-PEROT ETALONS WHICH DISPLAY NONLINEAR TRANSMITTANCE CHARACTERISTICS AT MW POWER LEVELS. PHASE II WILL FOCUS ON REFINING THE ETALON DESIGN TO OBTAIN QUANTITATIVE AGREEMENT WITH DESIRED LOGARITHMIC RESPONSE AND EXTENDING THE FABRICATION TECHNOLOGY TO PERMIT THE LARGE SCALE INTEGRATION OF THE DISCRETE DEVICES.",

THIS ENHANCEMENT WILL PROVIDE THREE SPECIFIC ADVANTAGES. FIRST, IT WILL PROVIDE A MEANS OF QUALITY CONTROL THROUGH THE SCIENTIFIC MONITORING OF THE THICK WALL COMPOSITE DURING MANUFACTURE. SECOND, IT WILL PROVIDE A MEANS OF \"REAL-TIME\" MONITORING OF THE CONDITION OF THE SHAFT WHILE IT IS IN OPERATION AND UNDER LOAD. THIRD, IT WILL PROVIDE A MEANS OF LOCATING AND QUANTIFYING THE EXTEND OF ANY DAMAGE TO THE SHAFT. THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE SELECTION OF SPECIFIC FIBER OPTICS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF A THREE DIMENSIONAL SPACING (MATRIX) SYSTEM OF PLACING THE OPTICS WITHIN THE COMPOSITE. THE PROPOSED \"SMART SKINS\" CONCEPT WILL RESULT IN THE NAVY BEING ABLE TO MONITOR THE HISTORY AND CONDITION OF THE COMPOSITE SHAFT FROM ITS INITIAL MANUFACTURE THROUGH ITS OPERATION ABOARD A SHIP.",

A PRELIMINARY STUDY HAS RESULTED IN A MODEL SYSTEM THAT COULD RECOGNIZE HANDWRITTEN ENGLISH ALPHABET AND ARABIC NUMERALS IN A TENTH OF A SECOND ON A 386 MICRO-COMPUTER WITH AVERAGE ACCURACY OVER 95% IN AN OFF-LINE WRITER INDEPENDENT MODE. THE GENERALIZATION IS SO GOOD THAT IT CAN RECOGNIZE EVEN LETTERS WITH ZIGZAG BROAD STROKES THAT ARE WIDELY DISTORTED FROM ANY OF THE LETTER PATTERNS THAT IT HAD SEEN BEFORE. THE SYSTEM IS ALSO VERY SIMPLE THAT IT TAKES ONLY ABOUT 100 KBYTE OF MEMORY STORAGE. WE ARE PLANNING TO CONNECT IT TO A TEXT TO SPEECH SYSTEM TO FORM A TOTALLY AUTOMATIC SYSTEM THAT COULD READ WRITTEN TEXTS OUT ALOUD. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - AUTOMATIC HANDWRITTEM CHARACTER RECOGNITION SYSTEM BASED ON NEURAL NETWORK PRINICIPLES IS SIMPLE, EFFICIENT, AND ACCURATE. ITS PERFORMANCE SEEMS TO SURPASS GREATLY ANY COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE SYSTEM KNOWN. IT CAN BE USED AS A FRONT END FOR A DOCUMENT PROCESSING SYSTEM IT TO CLASSIFY OR RETRIEVE TEXT DATA AUTOMATICALLY.

DIAMOND WOULD BE A VERY INTERESTING COMPONENT IN A COMPOSITE MATERIAL BECAUSE OF ITS EXTRAORDINARY HARDNESS, HIGH ELASTIC MODULUS, LOW COMPRESSIBILITY, LOW THERMAL EXPANSION AND RESISTANCE TO CHEMICAL ATTACK. THIS PROPOSAL OFFERS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PROCESS FOR GROWING DIAMOND FILAMENTS USING FLAME CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION (CVD). RESEARCH IN OUR LABORATORY DURING THE PAST YEAR HAS CONFIRMED HIGH GROWTH RATES OF DIAMONDS IN ACETYLENE FLAME AND, IN ADDITION, HAS SHOWN THAT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, DIAMOND FILAMENTS (APPROACHING SINGLE CRYSTALS)ARE FORMED. BY OPTIMIZING THE FLAME AND SUBSTRATE CONDITIONS IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO GROW DIAMOND FILAMENTS IN A CONTINUOUS PROCESS. PHASE I RESEARCH WILL CONSTRUCT A NOVEL FLAME REACTOR TO ELUCIDATE THE GROWTH CHEMISTRY OF DIAMOND FILAMENTS BY FLAME CVD. IN-SITU DIAGNOSTICS WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE GROWTH ENVIRONMENT. USING THESE TWO ASPECTS, THE PHASE I RESEARCH WILL DEMONSTRATE THE DEPOSITION OF SHORT SINGLE CRYSTAL DIAMOND FILAMENTS. THE FILAMENTS WILL BE HIGH QUALITY (LOW GRAPHITE CONTENT AND GOOD UNIFORMITY) AND BE AT LEAST 1 MM LONG. PHASE II WILL SYSTEMATICALLY IMPROVE THE SIZE AND GROWTH RATE OF THE FILAMENTS UNTIL SINGLE CRYSTAL GROWTH OF DIAMOND FILAMENTS OF ARBITRARY LENGTH IS ACHIEVED.",

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ANY POLLUTION CONTROL STRATEGY IS GREATLY ENHANCED BY THE ABILITY TO HAVE ON-LINE MONITORING OF THE CLEANUP DEVICE. REDUCING COSTS IS A MAJOR CONSIDERATION, AS THE MONITORING SYSTEM FOR A LARGE PLANT CAN EXCEED ONE MILLION DOLLARS. WHAT OFTEN DRIVES UP THE COST IS THE REQUIREMENT FOR SEVERALSEPARATE DEVICES FOR EACH SPECIES BEING MONITORED. THE GOALOF THIS PROPOSED PHASE I AND PHASE II PROJECT IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INSTRUMENT BASED ON FT-IR SPECTROSCOPY FOR MONITORING THE CONCENTRATIONS AND TEMPERATURES OF NITROGEN, SULFUR AND PARTICULATE POLLUTANT SPECIES FOUND IN COMBUSTION FLUE GASES. THE INSTRUMENT COULD ALSO BE USEDTO ISSUE CONTROL COMMANDS. IN THE PHASE I PROGRAM, WE PROPOSE TO MODIFY A RECENTLY DEVELOPED FT-IR, THE MICHELSON 110, MANUFACTURED BY BOMEM. THIS INSTRUMENT IS DESIGNED FORPROCESS MONITORING, IS RUGGED AND PORTABLE, AND SELLS FOR AROUND $30,000. THE PHASE I PROGRAM WILL INVOLVE SEPARATE TASKS TO ENHANCE THE OPTICAL HARDWARE, DATA ANALYSIS SOFTWARE, AND SAMPLING SYSTEM IN ORDER TO OBTAIN ANALYSES OF TRACE QUANTITIES OF THE GASEOUS POLLUTANT SPECIES DESPITEINTERFERENCES FROM THE MAIN COMBUSTION PRODUCTS IN SOME CASES (CO2, CO, H2O). THE INSTRUMENT WOULD BE TESTED IN A LABORATORY SCALE FLUIDIZED BED COMBUSTOR AT AFR. FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN THE INSTRUMENT, DEVELOPMENT OF A PROTOTYPE AND FIELD TESTING WOULD OCCUR IN PHASE II. THE PHASE II PROGRAM WOULD ALSO INCLUDE THE USE OF THE FT-IR MONITOR FOR MAKING MEASUREMENTS DIRECTLY IN A STACK OR IN THE FREEBOARD REGION OF A FLUIDIZED BED COMBUSTOR. THIS WOULD ALSO ALLOW AN INVESTIGATION OF THE APPLICATION OF THE INSTRUMENT FOR MEASUREMENT OF PARTICULATE CONCENTRATIONS.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         CARBON MATERIALS ARE A MUCH HIGHER ADDED VALUE PRODUCT THAN NEARLY ANY OTHER PRODUCTS FROM WHICH COULD BE PRODUCED FROM LIGNIN. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IN THE CASE OF CARBON FIBERS, WHICH CAN SELL FOR TENS TO HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS PER POUND. CONSEQUENTLY, THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROCESSES WHICH UTILIZE LIGNIN FOR THIS PURPOSE HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR A HIGHPAYOFF. PREVIOUS WORK SUGGESTS THAT AN APPROPRIATE MODIFICATION OF THE COMPOSITION OF LIGNIN-DERIVED PITCH COULD GREATLY ENHANCE ITS SUITABILITY AS A PRECURSOR MATERIAL. THE GENERATION OF A MESOPHASE FROM PYROLYSIS OF PITCH ONLY OCCURS IF SEVERAL CONDITIONS ARE MET. THE INTERMOLECULAR REACTIVITY IS A KEY FACTOR, AS IF THIS IS TOOHIGH, THE SYSTEM WILL CROSSLINK AT TEMPERATURES BELOW THOSE IN WHICH MESOPHASE IS GENERATED AND THE SYSTEM SOLIDIFIES TO FORM AN ISOTROPIC CARBON. THIS REACTIVITY CAN BE CONTROLLED BY CHEMICAL AND/OR THERMAL TREATMENT OF THE LIGNIN TO REMOVE REACTIVE FUNCTIONAL GROUPS. THESE TREATMENTS CAN ALSO BE USED TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE AVERAGE MOLECULAR WEIGHT, WHICH WILL TEND TO REDUCE THE REACTIVITY, AND THE VISCOSITY, BOTH OF WHICH ARE MORE FAVORABLE FOR MESOPHASE FORMATION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PHASE I PROGRAM WOULD BE TO INVESTIGAT THE APPROPRIATE THERMAL AND CHEMICAL TREATMENTS THAT WOULD LEAD TO THE OPTIMUM COMPOSITION FOR THE USE OF THE LIQUID PRODUCTS FROM LIGNIN AS A PRECURSOR FOR CARBON FIBER PRODUCTION. THE EXPERIMENTS WOULD BE DONE IN A NOVEL REACTOR SYSTEM EQUIPPEDWITH A POST-PYROLYSIS ISOTHERMAL CRACKING ZONE FOR THERMAL TREATMENT OF THE TARS IN ORDER TO \"TAILOR\" THEIR COMPOSITIONFOR CARBON FIBER PRODUCTION. THE PROGRESS OF THIS TREATMENTWOULD BE FOLLOWED BY ON-LINE FT-IR DIAGNOSTICS BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THE THERMAL CRACKING ZONE. THE KNOWLEDGE DEVELOPED IN THE PHASE I PROGRAM WOULD BE USED IN THE PHASE II PROGRAM TO DEVELOP A PROCESS TAILORED TOWARD THE PRODUCTION OF MESOPHASE PITCH FOR CARBON FIBER PRODUCTION AS THE PRIMARY LIQUID PRODUCT.",

FLUCTUATION OF OTHER OPERATING VARIABLES IN PLANT OPERATION AND THE CURRENT INABILITY TO RAPIDLY DETERMINE CHANGES IN FLOTATION PERFORMANCE IN REAL TIME HAVE LIMITED THE USE OF THE ASH TECHNOLOGY IN COAL PREPARATION PLANTS. PRELIMINARY STUDY INDICATES THAT A CORRELATION BETWEEN PRESSURE MEASUREMENTS, OPERATING VARIABLES, AND FLOTATION PERFORMANCE CAN BE ESTABLISHED AND SUCH A CORRELATION MODEL CAN BE USED AS A BASIS TO CONTROL FLOTATION PERFORMANCE. SINCE THESE PRESSURE MEASUREMENTS CAN BE DETERMINED IN REAL TIME DURING ASH FLOTATION, AUTOMATIC CONTROL AND OPTIMUM ADJUSTMENT OF THESE MANIPULATED VARIABLES CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED.

THE COMPUTER PROGRAM IS RELATIVELY SIMPLE AND EXECUTES QUICKLY ON A VARIETY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS. PROBLEMS REQUIRING SEVERAL THOUSAND NODES CAN BE SOLVED ON A PERSONAL COMPUTER. THE NUMERICAL MODEL SOLVES THE REDUCED FORM OF THE 3-D GOVERNING EQUATIONS FOR ATMOSPHERIC MOTION IN TERRAIN FOLLOWING COORDINATES.

CARBON-CARBON COMPOSITES SHOW GREAT PROMISE FOR THIS APPLICATION BECAUSE OF THEIR HIGH STRENGTH AND STIFFNESS AT ELEVATED TEMPERATURES.IN ORDER TO FULLY UTILIZE THE HIGH-TEMPERATURE ADVANTAGES OF CARBONCARBON, OXIDATION COATINGS ARE BEING DEVELOPED AND APPLIED TO CARBONCARBON TO PREVENT OXIDATION DEGRADATION OF THE PARTS AT ELEVATED TEMPERATURES. IT IS CRITICAL THAT THESE COATINGS BE DEFECT FREE. ADVANCES IN X-RAY COMPUTED TOMOGRAPH (CT) ARE PROVIDING METHODS FOR THE EVALUATION OF STRUCTURAL MATERIALS AT VERY HIGH RESOLUTIONS. IT IS PROPOSED THAT A HIGH-TEMPERATURE OVEN SYSTEM BE DESIGNED TO INTEGRATE WITH THE TOMOSCOPE HIGH-RESOLUTION CT SCAN SYSTEM SO THAT OXIDATION COATINGS OF CARBON-CARBON COMPOSITES CAN BE FULLY EVALUATED FOR DEFECTS THROUGHOUT THE RANGE OF OPERATING TEMPERATURES. SUCH A SYSTEM WILL BE ABLE TO VIEW TINY RACKS AND VOIDS THROUGHOUT THE COATINGS WHICH COULD CAUSE RAPID OXIDATION AND FAILURE OF THE CARBON-CARBON COMPONENT.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW POLYMERIC MATERIALS AND HIGHLY ASYMMETRIC MEMBRANES ARE TWO OF THE MAJOR REASONS FOR THIS EVOLUTION. DESPITE THESE ADVANCES, HOWEVER, THE USE OF MEMBRANE-BASED PROCESSES FOR BIOSEPARATIONS IS STILL LIMITED BY BOTH MEMBRANE FOULING AND GEL FORMATION DUE TO PROTEIN ADSORPTION. THESE PROBLEMSSEVERELY LIMIT THE EFFICIENCY OF MEMBRANE FILTRATION PROCESSES FOR CONCENTRATING PRODUCTS AND VIRTUALLY DISALLOW THE USE OF MEMBRANES FOR MORE SOPHISTICATED SEPARATIONS SUCH AS SIZE SELECTIVE FRACTION AND BIOSPECIFIC SORPTION. RECENT REPORTS ON THE INVESTIGATION OF FORMULATING CONDUCTIVE MEMBRANES FOR THE PREPARATION OF AN ELECTRIC POTENTIAL BARRIER TO CONTROL PERMEATION OF THE CHARGED SPECIES HAVE BROADENED POTENTIAL SEPARATION PROCESSES. IN THIS PROJECT, INNOVATIVE NEW TECHNOLOGICAL APPROACHES FOR ENHANCING THE PURIFICATION OF BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS WILL BE DESCRIBED. THE OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS OF CONDUCTIVE, ELECTRICALLY CHARGED MEMBRANES WILL BE COMPARED TO STANDARD, NONCONDUCTIVE MEMBRANES TO DETERMINE CHANGES IN APPARENT PORE SIZE, RETENTION CHARACTERISTICS, AND THROUGHPUT RATES. ADDITIONAL STUDIES OF THE EFFECTS OF CONDUCTIVE MEMBRANE SEPARATION ON MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES AS WELL AS CELL VIABILITY FOR BOTH MAMMALIAN AND NONMAMMALIAN CELLS WILL BE INITIATED.",

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK IS TO DEVELOP A HYBRID CONTROL SYSTEM MERGING TRAINABLE NEURAL NETWORK MODULES WITH A WELL-STRUCTURED KNOWLEDGE BASED CONTROL ARCHITECTURE. THE CONTROL STRUCTURE WILL MAINTAIN TASK DECOMPOSITION CONTROL AND DATA MANAGEMENT WHILE THE NEURAL NET MODULES WILL PROCESS THE SENSOR DATA AND CONTROL THE ACTUATOR SERVOS. RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS WILL BE DONE IN THE AREAS OF 1) CHARACTERIZING THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE ADJUSTABLE NETWORK PARAMETERS TO THE TYPE OF FUNCTION THAT CAN BE STORED, THE SPEED OF TRAINING, TYPE OF TRAINING, ACCURACY OF THE STORED FUNCTION AND TIME SEQUENCING AND TIME DELAY EFFECTS; 2) DEFINING THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN NEURAL NETWORK PROCESSING AND MORE CONVENTIONAL TASK REPRESENTATION; 3) DEFINING METHODS TO EXTRACT WORLD MODEL DESCRIPTIONS FROM THE TRAINEDNEURAL NETS. DEMONSTRATION TASK EMPLOYING HARDWARE IMPLEMENTATIONS WILL BE USED TO VALIDATE RESULTS. IT IS EXPECTED THAT PHASE I WILL PROVIDE SUFFICIENT CHARACTERIZATION OF THE NEURAL NETWORK AND CONTROL TASKS TO ALLOW PHASE II PROTOTYPE OF A TESTBED HYBRID CONTROL SYSTEM.

TODAY, ACCURATE MODELING CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED BY HAVING A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF THE PHYSICS OF THE SYSTEM IN ADDITION TO PERFORMING A COMPLETE DYNAMICS CHARACTERIZATION OF THE VARIABLES USED IN THE MODEL. REAL TIME EXECUTION OF THE MODEL IS THEN ACHIEVED BY SIMPLIFYING THE EQUATIONS OR BY EMPLOYING COSTLY, SPECIAL PURPOSE, HYBRID- OR SUPER-COMPUTERS. NEURAL NETWORKS LEND THEMSELVES WELL TO THIS APPLICATION DUE TO THEIR ABILITY TO ACCURATELY REPRESENT COMPLEX FUNCTIONS BY MEANS OF A REPETITIVE TRAINING PROCESS, WITHOUT REQUIRING EXTENSIVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SYSTEM, IN ADDITION TO THEIR ABILITY TO OPERATE IN REAL TIME DUE TO THEIR SIMPLICITY IN COMPUTATION AND STRONG DEPENDENCE ON TABULATION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO INVESTIGATE THEAPPLICATION OF ADVANCED NEURAL NETWORK METHODS TO DYNAMICS MODELING OF COMPLEX ROBOTIC SYSTEMS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ACHIEVING REAL TIME EXECUTION WHILE MAINTAINING THE ACCURACYOF THE MODEL. BOTH THE CMAC AND MULTI-LAYERED TYPE NETWORKSWILL BE EMPLOYED. AN ADVANCED HYBRID IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEURAL NETWORKS IS PROPOSED TO ALLOW REVERSED USE OF THE MODEL.

        "abstract": "Abstract         WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE A TECHNIQUE FOR INCREASING THE SENSITIVITY OF INTRACAVITY LASER ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY, WITH APPLICATION TO THE DETECTION AND MEASUREMENT OF TRACE GASES IN THE ATMOSPHERE. THE TECHNIQUE THAT WE WILL INVESTIGATE IS TO PLACE A MULTIPASS ABSORPTION CELL WITHIN THE RESONANT CAVITY OF A DYE LASER. WITH AN INTRACAVITY MULTIPASS CELL, THE OPTICAL ABSORPTION PATHLENGTH CAN BE INCREASED BY A FACTOR OF TEN TO THIRTY OVER THE TYPICAL VALUES ( 1 METER) OF EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEMS REPORTED IN THE LITERATURE. THUS WE MAY INCREASE THE SENSITIVITY OF INTRACAVITY LASER SPECTROSCOPY BY A FACTOR OF TEN OR MORE OVER THE PREVIOUS STATE OF THE ART. THERE ARE NUMEROUS IMPORTANT ATMOSPHERIC TRACE GASES WITH ABSORPTION LINES IN THE VISIBLE TO NEAR ULTRAVIOLET WHICH MAY BE MEASURED WITH ALONG-CAVITY ILS INSTRUMENT. THESE GASES INCLUDE NO3, NO2, O3, SO2, HNO2, CH2O, AND OH. THE ABSORPTION CROSS SECTIONS FOR THESE GASES ARE MODERATE, BUT THEIR EXTREMELY LOW CONCENTRATIONS (SOME BELOW PART-PER-TRILLION LEVELS) MAKE THEM DIFFICULT TO MEASURE. OUR GENERAL GOAL FOR PHASE I RESEARCH IS TO DEMONSTRATE AND EXPLORE THE BEHAVIOR OF A TUNABLE DYE LASER THAT HAS AN INTRACAVITY LONG-PATH MULTI-PASS ABSORPTION CELL. WE ALSO HAVE THE GOAL OF MAKINGA PRELIMINARY EVALUATION OF THE APPLICABILITY OF SUCH A LASER SYSTEM TO THE PROBLEM OF MEASURING WEAKLY ABSORBING ATMOSPHERIC GASES. PHASE II RESEARCH WILL INVOLVE THE CONSTRUCTION OF A MORE COMPLETE ATMOSPHERIC TRACE GAS MEASUREMENT INSTRUMENT, BASED ON THE BASIC LONG-CAVITY ILS SYSTEM FIRST DEMONSTRATED IN PHASE I. AN ATMOSPHERIC TRACE GAS MEASUREMENT INSTRUMENT BASED ON A LONG-CAVITY ILS SYSTEMWOULD HAVE MANY OF THE PROPERTIES DESIRED IN MODERN ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY RESEARCH. THESE PROPERTIES INCLUDE: HIGH SENSITIVITY, FAST RESPONSE, POINT MEASUREMENT CAPABILITY AND RUGGEDNESS.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         HIGH PRESSURE OXYGEN LINES ARE COMMON COMPONENTS OF SPACE FLIGHT SYSTEMS. A PROBLEM ASSOCIATED WITH THESE LINES IS THE POTENTIAL FOR PNEUMATIC IMPACT INITIATED IGNITION CAUSEDBY THE ADIABATIC COMPRESSION OF THE RESIDUAL OXYGEN IN A LINE WHEN IT IS OPENED TO THE HIGH PRESSURE OXYGEN SOURCE. A NONINTRUSIVE MEANS OF MEASURING THE TEMPERATURE IN THESE LINES IN THE TIME SCALE OVER WHICH THE HEATING IS OCCURRING WILL GREATLY AID THE DETERMINATION OF THE CAUSE OF THE IMPACT INITIATED IGNITION. WE PROPOSE THE INNOVATION OF USING RAYLEIGH SCATTERING TO DETERMINE THE TEMPERATURE NEAR THE END OF THE LINE AT A RATE WHICH CAN RESOLVE THE ADIABATIC COMPRESSION PROCESS. WE ALSO PROPOSE TO USE A NOVEL SHOCK POSITION SENSOR TO DETERMINE THE SHOCK VELOCITY AND LOCATION FROM WHICH THE TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION IN THE LINE CAN BE DETERMINED. OPTICS FOR DELIVERING THE LASER BEAM AND COLLECTING THE RAYLEIGH SCATTERED LIGHT WILL BE INCORPORATED IN THE END CAP OF THE LINE. THE END CAP WILL HAVE THE SAME INNER DIAMETER AS THE OXYGEN LINE SO AREA DISCONTINUITIES ARE AVOIDED. THE PROPOSED SENSORS ARE BOTH LOW COST AND SIMPLE IN DESIGN AND USE. THE PHASE I PROGRAM WILL CONSIST OF A LABORATORY DEMONSTRATION OF THE RAYLEIGH SCATTERING MEASUREMENTS IN HIGH PRESSURE LINES, AN ANALYTICAL MODELING EFFORT WHICH APPROXIMATELY DESCRIBES THE COMPRESSION PROCESSES, AND THE PRELIMINARY DESIGN OF THE RAYLEIGH SCATTERING AND SHOCK POSITION SENSORS.",

A SIMPLE AND EFFECTIVE PASSIVE PITCH CONTROL USING A BEAM-TORQUE MEMBER MOUNTED WITHIN THE BLADE STRUCTURE AND ATTACHED TO THE BLADE AT A STATION AT ABOUT HALF THE PROPELLER RADIUS IS DESCRIBED. THIS STRUCTURAL PROCEDURE IS NOT POSSIBLE ON CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT PROPELLERS, BUT THE SMALLER SCALE AND POWER OUTPUT OF THE UAV MAKE IT ACCEPTABLE IN THIS CASE.

THUS, THE LOWER THE BIT RATE, THE LOWER THE MEMORY REQUIREMENT, AND THE LOWER THE MEMORY REQUIREMENT, THE LESS EXPENSIVE THE END PRODUCT, INTO WHICH THIS CHIP WILL BE IMPLEMENTED, WILL BE. CURRENTLY, THERE IS NO LOW COST, HIGH QUALITY, LOW BIT RATE SYNTHESIZER AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET. WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS NEW CHIP, WE CAN PENETRATE ALMOST ANY MARKET REQUIRING SYNTHESIZED SPEECH.",

A STREAM OF POTABLE WATER IS RECOVERED FROM THE DESICCANT IN A SIMPLE BOILER. THE EFFICIENCY OF THE AMCS IS GREATLY IMPROVED BY USING AN ENGINE-DRIVEN COMPRESSOR TO RAISE THE PRESSURE OF THE STEAM FROM THE BOILER TO A LEVEL AT WHICH THE HEAT OF CONDENSATION CAN BE TRANSFERRED BACK TO THE BOILER. AT LOW AMBIENT RELATIVE HUMIDITIES, THE AMCS WOULD USE A SOLID DESICCANT TO FIRST CONCENTRATE THE WATER VAPOR BEFORE COLLECTING IT IN THE LIQUID DESICCANT ABSORBER. BASED ON EXISTING LIQUID-DESICCANT DEHUMIDIFIERS,AN AMCS THAT PRODUCES 375 LB/HR AT AN EFFICIENCY OF 16 GAL/GAL-FUEL WHEN AMBIENT HUMIDITES ARE MODERATE CAN BE EASILY CONTAINED IN AN ISO 8X8X20 ENCLOSURE AND WOULD WEIGH ABOUT 4600 LB. A VERY LOW AMBIENT HUMIDITIES (5%), WATER YIELDS WOULD BE 7 GAL/GAL-FUEL, BUT THE CAPACITY OF THE SYSTEM WOULD DROP TO AROUND 100 LB/HR.

IN MOST APPLICATIONS, X-RAY PHOTOCATHODES ARE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH A MICROCHANNEL PLATE (MCP) AND A POSITION-SENSITIVE DETECTOR. DEVICES INCORPORATING THIS COMBINATION ARE CAPABLE OF IMAGING X-RAYSWITH VERY HIGH SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL RESOLUTION. MANY DIFFERENT X-RAY PHOTCATHODE MATERIALS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO DATE. THESE MATERIALS HAVE USUALLY BEEN ALKALI-HALIDES (E.G., CSL OR CSBR) AND TEND TO BE HYGROSCOPIC IN NATURE. FOR THIS REASON SPECIAL HANDLING AND TREATMENT OF THESE MATERIALS IS NECESSARY TO PREVENT THEM FROM DEGRADATION IN THE LABORATORY. IN ADDITION, X-RAYIMAGING SYSTEMS EMPLOYING THESE MATERIALS AS X-RAY PHOTOCATHODES SUFFER FROM LOW SENSITIVITY AND VERY POOR ENERGY RESOLUTION. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP THE SEMI-INSULATING SEMICONDUCTOR MATERIAL THALLIUM BROMIDE (TIBR) FOR USE AS AN X-RAY PHOTOCATHODE. BECAUSE OF THE HIGH ATOMIC NUMBER OF ITS CONSTITUENT ELEMENTS, TIBR HAS A VERY HIGH X-RAY STOPPING POWER AND A HIGH YIELD OF SECONDARY ELECTRONS. MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE HAVE GROWN CRYSTALS OF TIBR IN OUR LABORATORIES AND FOUND THAT THIS MATERIAL IS MECHANICALLY AND CHEMICALLY VERY STABLE. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS MATERIAL WOULD LEAD TO A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE UTILITY OF DEVICES EMPLOYING X-RAY PHOTOCATHODES.",

THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN DEVELOPED INTO A NEW SEPARATION TECHNIQUE, CAPILLARY ZONE ELECTROPHORESIS (CZE) AND IS PARTICULARLY APPROPRIATE FOR THE SEPARATION OF LOW ABUNDANCEMATERIALS. THIS TECHNIQUE PROVIDES MUCH GREATER RESOLUTION THAN TRADITIONAL ELECTROPHORESIS TECHNIQUES AND CAN ACHIEVE SEPARATIONS OF COMPLEX MIXTURES AS MUCH AS AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE FASTER. THE CZE TECHNOLOGY IS CURRENTLY OF VERY HIGH INTEREST SINCE IT APPEARS TO MAKE POSSIBLE THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW, HIGH SPEED INSTRUMENTATION FOR ANALYTICAL BIOCHEMISTRY. HOWEVER,IN ORDER TO MAKE FULL USE OF THIS NEW, POWERFUL SEPARATION TECHNIQUE, SEVERAL ASPECTS OF THE TECHNOLOGY REQUIRE FURTHERDEVELOPMENT.

A THEORETICAL COMPARISON OF THE PROPOSED SEPARATOR WITH WORK PUBLISHED ON OPEN GRADIENT MAGNETIC SEPARATION BY THE OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LABORATORY INDICATES THAT THE SEPARATOR WILL HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF ASH CLEANING. THIS IS BECAUSE OF ITS COUNTERCURRENT PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION, THE HIGH GRADIENT MAGNETIC FIELD OCCURRING IN THE NARROW GAP THROUGH WHICH THE COAL IS TRANSPORTED AND THE LIMITED MOVEMENT NECESSARY TO EFFECT SEPARATION. LOW PROCESSING COST AND HIGH LEVELS OF PYRITIC SULFUR REMOVAL ARE EXPECTED. THE SEPARATOR CAN BE LINEARLY AND ECONOMICALLY SCALED TO MANY TONS PER HOUR. THE SEPARATOR HAS BEEN TESTED ON DRY 10 MICRON DIAMETER COALAND MEASURABLE SEPARATION OF BOTH ASH AND SULFUR WAS OBTAINED. VERY STRONG ELECTROSTATIC EFFECTS WERE ALSO OBSERVED, THAT IN SOME CASES WERE SUFFICIENT TO REVERSE THE SEPARATION. THEORETICAL ANALYSIS OF THE DRY MAGNETIC SEPARATION INCLUDING THE ELECTROSTATIC EFFECTS EXPLAINS BOTH THE SIGN AND MAGNITUDE OF THE OBSERVED SEPARATIONS. THIS SAME ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT USING A CONDUCTIVE FLUID WITH A RESISTIVITY LESS THAN 3 X 10(5) CM COMPLETELY ELIMINATE ALL ELECTROSTATIC EFFECTS. WATER WITH MORE THAN 2PARTS PER MILLION OF SODIUM CHLORIDE OR SIMILAR ELECTROLYTE IS SUFFICIENTLY CONDUCTIVE FOR ELECTROSTATIC EFFECTS TO BE NEGLIGIBLE.",

THE NEW TECHNIQUE INVOLVES THE APPLICATION OF A SLURRY COAT OF A DISPERSION OF METAL PRATICLES ON A CLEAN FOIL SURFACE FOLLOWED BY HEATING. THIS PROMOTES A HIGH TEMPERATURE SYNTHESIS REACTION (SHS) BETWEEN THE METAL PARTICLES, AND FORMS, WITHIN TEN (10) SECONDS, AN INSITU INTERMETALLIC COATING ON THE STEEL SURFACE. SUBSEQUENT SELECTIVE LEACHING PROVIDES THE CHARACTERISTICS SELF-IGNITING ACTIVATEDMETAL SURFACE. INDIVIDUAL STRIPS OF 1-MIL STEEL FOIL HAVE ALREADY BEEN PROCESSED BY THIS TECHNIQUE.

REBURNING OR IN-FURNACE NOX REDUCTION (IFNR) AND DRY SORBENTINJECTION (DSI) ARE RELATIVELY ECONOMICAL AND RETROFITTABLE NOX AND SO2 CONTROL TECHNIQUES. HOWEVER, THESE TECHNIQUES ARE RESTRICTED IN APPLICATION BY THE LIMITED TIME WITHIN THEFURNACE FOR INJECTANT PROCESSING, DISPERSION AND REACTION. THE PROPOSED PULSE COMBUSTOR NOX AND SO2 REDUCTION (PCNSR) TECHNIQUE OVERCOMES THESE LIMITATIONS, BY UTILIZING PULSATING FLOW TO OPTIMALLY CALCINE THE SORBENT AND GASIFY THE COAL PRIOR TO RAPIDLY DISPERSING THE SORBENT AND FUEL INTHE FURNACE GASES. PCNSR SYSTEM, VERY GOOD NOX AND SO2 CONTROL AND BURNOUT CAN BE ACHIEVED FOR INEXPENSIVE LIMESTONE SORBENT AND COAL REBURNING FUEL. BECAUSE THE DEVICE IS SIMPLE AND CONVERTS COMBUSTION ENERGY DIRECTLY TO FLOW MOMENTUM, SYSTEMS COSTS ARE LOW. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PHASE I PROGRAM IS TO DEMONSTRATE, BY EXPERIMENTAL AND ANALYTICAL MEANS, COMBINED NOX AND SO2 REDUCTION AT LOWER COSTS USING THE PCNSR TECHNIQUE. IN THE PHASE I EFFORT, AN EXISTING PULSE COMBUSTOR TEST FACILITY AND SORBENT CAPTURE AND COMBUSTION COMPUTER MODELS WILL BE USED TO ASSESS PCNSR SYSTEM SO2 CONTROL, NOX REDUCTION AND BURNOUT PERFORMANCE.

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP A MORE EFFICIENT, HIGH POWER MILLIMETER WAVE SOURCE BY MODIFYING THE ORIGINAL ORBITRON MASER. THE ORIGINAL ORBITRON IS DRIVEN BY A SINGLE POWER SUPPLY (I.E.A SMALL CAPACITOR) WHICH GENERATES AN AXISYMMETRIC LOGARITHMIC POTENTIAL-WELL AS RADIALLY DIRECTING (AT FIRST) ELECTRON BEAMS IN THE TUBE OF COAXIAL GEOMETRY. HOWEVER, THE POSITIVE POTENTIAL (V(O)) INITIALLY APPLIED ON THE CENTER CONDUCTOR DECAYS CONTINUALLY AS THE DISCHARGE CURRENT INCREASES DUE TO THE INDUCTIVE LOAD OF THE ORBITRON TUBE, THEREBY PREMATURELY TERMINATING THE EMISSION OF HIGH FREQUENCY COMPONENTS (F(O)?SQ RT V(O)). SIMPLE REPLACEMENT OF THE CAPACITOR WITH A BATTERY IS NOT ECONOMICAL, BUT ALSO FLATTENS THE POTENTIALWELL AS THE DISCHARGE CURRENT INCREASES BEYOND THE TRANSITION FROM GLOW TO ARC. FOR SINGLY POWERED ORBITRONS, MORE THAN HALF THE RADIALLY INJECTED ELECTRONS IS LOST DIRECTLY TO THE ANODE, BEFORE PARTICIPATING IN THE MILLIMETERWAVE OSCILLATION BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF ACCELERATION BEFORE COLLISIONS. THE MAJOR EFFORT OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO OVERCOME THE PROBLEM OF LOW EFFICIENCY THROUGH A MINIMUM MODIFICATION OF THE ORIGINAL ORBITRON MASER. TWO SEPARATE POWER SUPPLIES, ONE FOR THE POTENTIAL-WELL AND ANOTHER FOR THE ELECTRON BEAM, WILL BE EMPLOYED. A NOVEL SCHEME WOULD CONSERVE THE POTENTIAL-WELL UP TO VERY HIGH VOLTAGES, IMPORTANT FOR HIGH FRE-N QUENCY GENERAGION. THE ELECTRON BEAM WILL BE INJECTED EXTERNALLY BY MINIATURE GUNS IN THE TANGENTIAL DIRECTION SO THAT A MAJORITY OF ELECTRONS UNDERGOES A HELICAL ORBIT BEFORE REACHING THE CENTER CONDUCTOR (ANODE). OUR PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENT WITH A COLD-CATHODE ELECTRON GUN WAS ENCOURAGING. THE USEFULNESS OF A NUMBER OF SUCH GUNS AND THE EFFECT OF NON-ORTHOGONAL (WITH RESPECT TO THE TUBE AXIS) INJECTION WILL BE INVESTIGATED IN TERMS OF POWER AND EFFICIENCY ENHANCEMENT DURING THE PHASE I PERIOD. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL INCLUDE EXTENTION OF THEORY, PROOF-OF-THEORY EXPERIMENTATION ASSISTED BY NOVEL DIAGNOSTIC TECHNIQUES, AND FABRICATION AND CHARATERIZATION OF THE MODIFIED ORBITRON PROTOTYPE.",

THE SPECIFIC INNOVATION ADDRESSED BY THIS PROPOSAL IS THE EMPLOYMENT OF A NON-INTRUSIVE, RUGGED OPTICAL IMAGING METHOD COMPATIBLE WITH ROUGH AND POORLY REFLECTING ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEM COMPONENTS. THIS IS AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH BECAUSE SUCH A METHOD BASED ON GUIDEDWAVE PROPAGATION PHENOMENA CAN USE THE LAMB WAVE TECHNIQUE IN WHICH MEASUREMENTS OF ACOUSTIC WAVE SPEEDS CAN BE DIRECTLY RELATED TO MATERIAL STIFFNESS PROPERTIES. IT IS BELIEVED BY THIS RESEARCH TEAM THAT THE PROPOSED APPROACH DETAILED IN THIS PROGRAM CAN ADDRESS THE ASSOCIATED OPTICAL DETECTION PROBLEMS IN THE AREA OF SURFACE ACOUSTICAL MEASUREMENTS EMPLOYING OPTICAL TECHNOLOGY. TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES INCLUDE IDENTIFICATION OF ELASTIC WAVE PARAMETERS AND TESTING REQUIREMENTS, EVALUATION OF A RUGGED MULTI-AXIS ACOUSTIC DISPLACEMENT SENSOR, INTEGRATION OF ACOUSTO-OPTICAL ULTRASONIC (AOU) DETECTION SUBSYSTEMS, ASSESSMENT OF TEST DATA AND DESIGN OF A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT SYSTEM FOR DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING IN THE PHASE II PROGRAM. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THESE OBJECTIVES WILL RESULT IN THEDEVELOPMENT OF THE PROPOSED AOU INSTRUMENTATION FOR MONITORING THE PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS OF FLIGHT VEHICLES IN NASA'S ADVANCED STRUCTURAL SYSTEMS.",

THE KEY INNOVATION IS THE USE OF PRE-AFFIXED MULTI-COLORED TRACKING TARGETS, AND A HARDWARE PREPROCESSOR FOR RAPIDLY IDENTIFYING THEM UNDER VARIABLE ILLUMINATION. COMPARED WITHALTERNATE TECHNOLOGIES THIS SYSTEM OFFERS THE FOLLOWING FOURADVANTAGES. FIRST, HIGH CAPACITY: HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF OBJECTS COULD BE IDENTIFIED AND DOZENS TRACKED SIMULTANEOUSLY. SECOND, HIGH SPEED: THE IDENTIFICATION, LOCATION AND THREE-AXIS ORIENTATION OF DOZENS OF OBJECTS COULD BE DERIVED EVERY 60TH OF A SECOND. THIRD, EASE OF PROGRAMMING: THE PROPOSED DESIGN IS INHERENTLY SELF-TEACHING. FINALLY, LOW COST: THE PROPOSED SYSTEM WOULDREQUIRE TWO LOW-COST COLOR CAMERAS AND ONE BOARD BUILT WITH OFF-THE-SHELF LSI AND VLSI COMPONENTS. THE ANTICIPATED POSITIONAL ACCURACY IS PLUS OR MINUS SEVERAL MILLIMETERS AT A RANGE OF 10 METERS.

ADVANCED TECHNOLGIES, MATERIALS, AND INNOVATIVE ENGINEERING IDEAS CAN BE EXPLOITED ABOARD INTRATHEATER AIRLIFTERS--WHERE SUPPLIER MEETS USER--TO FACILITATE THE DELIVERY OF SUPPLIED. THIS PROPOSAL OUTLINES AN APPROACH TO IDENTIFY PROMISING TECHNOLOGIES AND MATERIALS, AND DEVELOP INNOVATIVE IDEAS. THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY RESEARCHING TO UNCOVER CANDIDATE TECHNOLOGIES/MATERIALS/IDEAS, AND EXERCISING EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS TO MODEL THE NEW CAPABILITIES AND COMPARE BENEFITS. THE APPROACH EMPHASIZES ARMY A WELL AS AIR FORCE INPUT TO MORE FULLY IDENTIFY THE KEY ISSUES IN INTRATHEATER AIRLIFT INTEROPERABILITY.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS T ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF DATA CAPTURE AND TREATMENT FROM SUCH AN INSTRUMENT. AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO TIME AVERAGING, IT IS PROPOSED THAT A COVARIANCE CORRELATION ALGORITHM BE APPLIED TO CAPTURE, STORE, AND ANALYZE EACH AND EVERY MASS SCAN FOR SHOT-TO-SHOTVARIATIONS IN THE INTENSITY OF EACH OBSERVED MASS PEAK. IN THIS MANNER, NONRANDOM VARIATIONS COULD BE QUANTIFIED AND RETURNED TO THE USER AS ANALYSES AS TO WHICH MASSES ARE PARENTS, WHICH ARE DAUGHTERS, AND WHICH PARENTS AND DAUGHTERS ARE RELATED. THE AIM OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO SIMPLIFY THE ANALYSIS OF MULTIGENERATION MASS SPECTRA TOF MASS SPECTRA USING AN ELECTROSPRAY IONIZATION SOURCE WILL BE USED TO GENERATE DATA STREAMS. USING A HIGH-SPEED REGISTRATION SYSTEM, STUDIES WILL DETERMINE THE NECESSARY DATA TRANSFER RATES, STORAGE CAPACITIES, AND COMPUTATIONAL SPEEDS NECESSARY FOR COVARIANCE CORRELATION TO BE BOTH SCIENTIFICALLY VALUABLE AND FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE.

IN PHASE I, ANTIRETROVIRAL PROPERTIES OF AZT CONJUGATE I WILL BE OPTIMIZED, E.G., BY INCREASING THE AZT CONTENT IN THE CONJUGATE. ACTIVITY OF THE CONJUGATES WILL BE EVALUATEDIN VITRO USING HIV AND MURINE RETROVIRUS INFECTION OF T CELLS, MACROPHAGES, AND FIBROBLASTS. AZT-CARBOXYDEXTRAN CONJUGATES WILL BE SYNTHESIZED, EVALUATED, AND OPTIMIZED TO TARGET THE DRUG TO MACROPHAGE CELLS AND FOR INDUCTION OF INTERFERON. IN PHASE II, TWO WELL-CHARACTERIZED MURINE RETROVIRUS MODEL SYSTEMS WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE THE PHARMACOKINETICS AND DYNAMICS OF THE COMPOUNDS AS WELL AS TO DETERMINE THE ABILITY OF POLYMERIC AND MONOMERIC CARRIERS TO TARGET ANTIVIRALS TO SPECIFIC TISSUES.

DIRECT AND RAPID MEASUREMENTS OF THIS RATIO AT SEVERAL LOCATIONS ABOUT THE PLASMA CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE UNIFORMITY OF NEUTRON PRODUCTION AS WELL AS THE RADIAL POSITION OF THE FUSING PORTION OF THE PLASMA. THE APPLICANT PROPOSES TO ADAPT SUPERHEATED DROP (SDD) COMPOSITIONS, RECENTLY INTRODUCED BY THE APPLICANT'S ORGANIZATION FOR HEALTH PHYSICS APPLICATIONS, FOR THIS CHALLENGING FUSION MEASUREMENT TASK. THESE SDD COMPOSITIONS, CONTAINING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SUPERHEATED DROPS IN A HOST GEL, RESPOND TO NEUTRONS THROUGH THE INITIATION OF DROP VAPORIZATION, AS IN THE BUBBLE CHAMBER. THE RESULTING VAPOR BUBBLES OCCUPY 250 TIMES THE VOLUME OF THE DROPS THAT CREATED THEM, THEREBY LEADING TO A MACROSCOPIC NON-ELECTRONIC MEASURE OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF NEUTRONS TO WHICH THE COMPOSITION WAS EXPOSED. MOREOVER, SUPERHEATED DROP COMPOSITIONS EMPLOYING DIFFERENT SENSITIVE MATERIALS HAVE DIFFERENT ENERGY THRESHOLDS. BY USING ONE MATERIAL WITH A 2 MEV THRESHOLD, A COUNT OF BOTH D-D AND D-TNEUTRONS CAN BE OBTAINED. BY USING ANOTHER COMPOSITION WITHA 6 MEV THRESHOLD, COUNTS OF JUST 14 MEV NEUTRONS FROM THE D-T REACTION WILL BE OBTAINED. THUS THE D-D/D-T RATIO CAN BE COMPUTED. THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL EXPLORE THE RANGE OF CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THE SDD SYSTEM WILL OPERATE IN THE PLASMA FUSIONENVIRONMENT, WILL PROPOSE MODIFICATIONS IN THE SDD COMPOSITIONS TO MEET THESE OPERATING CONDITIONS, AND WILL DECIDE AMONG A NUMBER OF OPTIONS FOR READING OUT THE CHANGESMANIFESTED IN THE COMPOSITION AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED AT SEVERAL POSITIONS ABOUT THE FUSING PORTION OF THE PLASMA.",

ANTIBODIES TO NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTORS (ACHRS) OF MUSCLE ARE DETECTABLE IN 90 PERCENT OF PATIENTS AND CAUSE THE WEAKNESS OF MG. ANTIBODY LEVELS CAN BE DECREASED BY PLASMAPHERESIS, AND THIS IS CORRELATED WITH IMPROVED CLINICAL STATUS. THIS RESEARCH WILL ESTABLISH THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING AN ANTIGEN-SPECIFIC IMMUNOADSORPTION DEVICE TO REMOVE ANTI-ACHR IN MG. TOWARD THIS GOAL, APPLIED IMMUNESCIENCES, INC., HAS RECENTLY DESIGNED, CLONED, AND EXPRESSED THE MAJOREXTRACELLULAR DOMAIN (AMINO ACID RESIDUES 1-210) OF THE ALPHA SUBUNIT OF HUMAN ACHR. THE SPECIFIC AIMS ARE: (1) PURIFICATION OF RECOMBINANT ACHR (RACHR) FROM ESCHERICHIA COLI BY CONVENTIONAL AND AFFINITY CHROMATOGRAPHIC TECHNIQUES, (2) CHARACTERIZATION OF RACHR BY PHYSICAL AND BIOLOGICAL TECHNIQUES, (3) COVALENT IMMOBILIZATION OF RACHR ONTO CELLULOSIC MEMBRANES, AND (4) EVALUATION OF THE EFFICACY OF IMMOBILIZED RACHR FOR SPECIFIC REMOVAL OF PATHOLOGIC ANTIBODY FROM MG PATIENT SERAUSING A COMBINATION OF IMMUNOASSAYS. DEVELOPMENT OF AN ANTIGEN-SPECIFIC IMMUNOADSORPTION DEVICE REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT ADVANCE IN THE TREATMENT OF MG BECAUSE IT WILL ALLOW FOR THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE REMOVAL OF MG PATIENT AUTOANTIBODIES. IN CONJUNCTION WITH SPECIFIC T-CELL THERAPY, THERE IS NOW HOPE FOR ANTIGEN-SPECIFIC IMMUNOMODULATIONS THAT MAY EVEN LEAD TO A LONG-TERM CURE.",

AFTER GENERATION OF A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF MICROSTRUCTURES, THE ELASTIC MODULI OF THE COMPOSITE FILM ARE COMPUTED ACCORDING TO THEODOROU-SUTER ALGORITHM. THE SCHEME IS USED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF THERMAL EXPANSION MISMATCH AND CRYSTALLIZATION ON THE ELASTIC MODULI. THE SCHEME IS GENERAL AND MAY BE APPLIED TO ANY SEMICRYSTALLINE THERMOPLASTIC COMPOSITE.",

RELATIVELY LITTLE RESEARCH, HOWEVER, HAS BEEN CONDUCTED IN PROBABILISTIC STRUCTURAL MECHANICS TO EXPLOIT THE POWER OF THESE MACHINES. WE WILL INVESTIGATE NEW AND INNOVATIVE APPROACHES FOR IMPLEMENTING MONTE CARLO METHODS ON A PARALLEL COMPUTER FOR THE SOLUTION OF PSM PROBLEMS. THE OBJECTIVES OF THE PHASE I EFFORT WILL FOCUS ON THE EVALUATION, IN A PARALLEL COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE, OF PROBABILISTIC MONTE CARLO IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES, INCLUDING PIPELINING (VECTORIZATION), CONCURRENCY (MULTITASKING), SYNCHRONIZATION, AND VARIANCE REDUCTION TECHNIQUES. WHILE MUCH OF THE RESEARCH IN PSM OVER THE LASTTWO DECADES HAS FOCUSED ON BASIC THEORY DEVELOPMENT, THE NEXT DECADE OF RESEARCH IN COMPUTATIONAL PSM MAY OPEN UP A WHOLE NEW CLASS OF FINITE ELEMENT AND DYNAMICS PROBLEMS TO PROBABILISTIC STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS.",

THE DEVICE IS SMALL ENOUGH TO \"PIGGY BACK\" ON THE PROPOSED REENTRY VEHICLE (RV) INTERCEPTOR MISSILES, OR BE CARRIED IN CONVENTIONAL ARTILLERY AND TANK PROJECTILES FOR USE IN LAND WARFARE. THIS CONCEPT UTILIZES AN EXPLOSIVELY COLLAPSED BETATRON TO GENERATE HIGH ENERGY ELECTRONS WHICH ARE THEN DIRECTED INTO A CONVERTER SHIELD COMPOSED OF DENSE METAL SUCH AS TANTALUM. THE KINETIC ENERGY OF THE ELECTRONS IS THEN CONVERTED TO GAMMA RADIATION WHICH IS PROJECTED FORWARD IN A HIGHLY FOCUSED, BEAM-LIKE GEOMETRY. ELECTRONIC KILL OR TARGET DISCRIMINATION OCCURS WHEN THE GAMMA RAYS PENETRATE INTO OBJECTS IN THEIR PATH, INTERACTING WITH THE ATOMIC STRUTURES OF THE TARGETS, THUS CAUSING DAMAGE AND MEASURABLE SECONDARY EMISSIONS.

THE NOVEL ELEMENT IN THE PROCESS CONSISTS OF A HOLLOWFIBER CROSSFLOW MEMBRANE CONTACTOR TO WHICH AN AQUEOUS FEED SOLUTION OF ANTI-ICING AGENT AND A SUITABLE WATER-IMMISCIBLE EXTRACTION FLUID ARE SUPPLIED. THE POROUS MEMBRANES CONTAINED THEREIN PROVIDE HIGH-SURFACE-AREA CONTACT BETWEEN THE TWO IMMISCIBLE PHASES ON EITHER SIDE OF THEM AND FACILITATE EFFICIENT TRANSPORT OF THE ANTI-ICING ADDITIVE FROM THE AQUEOUS PHASE TO THE EXTRACTION FLUID; HOWEVER, DISPERSION OF THE PHASES AND THE PROBLEMS ATTENDANT THERETO ARE AVOIDE.

THE HIGH SENSITIVITY OF THIS TECHNIQUE TO ADSORBED GASES WILL BE AUGMENTED BY THEUSE OF A GOLD-FILM ACTIVE SURFACE AND ELEVATED TEMPERATURE OPERATION TO ESTABLISH SELECTIVITY AND EXTEND THE CONCENTRATION LIMITS OF OPERATION. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH BUILDS UPON A STRONG GOLD-FILM-SENSOR TECHNOLOGY BASE WITHIN THE ARIZONA INSTRUMENT CORPORATION. INITIALLY, A PROTOTYPE SENSOR WILL BE DESIGNED, BUILT AND EVALUATED TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF THE APPROACH. HYDROGEN SULFIDEWILL BE USED IN THE EVALUATION BECAUSE OF ITS IMPORTANCE AS AN INDUSTRIAL TOXIN, ITS STRONG INTERACTION WITH GOLD ANDTHE CRITICAL NEED FOR H2S SENSORS THAT CONTINUOUSLY MONITOR WIDE RANGES OF CONCENTRATION. SUCCESS IN THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL ENABLE THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF A NEW CLASS OFCOMPACT, COST-EFFECTIVE GAS SENSORS PERMITTING A DEGREE OF CONTROL OF SENSITIVITY AND SELECTIVITY HERETOFORE NOT POSSIBLE. THE GREAT FLEXIBILITY OF THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL ENSURE ITS UTILITY IN CONTINUOUS MONITORING OF A BROAD RANGEOF TOXIC INDUSTRIAL GASES. THE WORLDWIDE APPLICATIONS POSSIBLE WILL PERMIT SIGNIFICANT MARKET PENETRATION BY AZI IN A TECHNICAL AREA DOMINATED BY FOREIGN INTERESTS.",

THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS OUR APPROACH IS TWOFOLD. FIRST, DETECTION PERFORMANCE CAN BE DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED FOR THE DETECTION OF TARGETS IN SEVERE BACKGROUND CLUTTER, IN WHICH EXCESSIVE FALSE ALARMS ARE A TYPICAL PROBLEM. SECONDLY, MORPHOLOGY-BASED ALGORITHMS CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN VERY HIGH-SPEED HARDWARE BECAUSE THE FUNDAMENTAL OPERATIONS INVOLVE ONLY LOGICAL COMPARISONS (MIN AND MAX). THE ADVANTAGES OF THIS APPROACH MAKE IT IDEALLY SUITED FOR PROCESSING LARGE VOLUMES OF SAR AND MULTISPECTRAL DATA AT VERY LOW COMPUTATIONAL COST USING SPECIALIZED HARDWARE OR FINE-GRAINED PARALLEL COMPUTERS. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS ATLANTIC AEROSPACE ELECTRONICS CORPORATION HAS DEVELOPED AND DEMONSTRATED THIS MORPHOLOGY-BASED TECHNOLOGY FOR DETECTING NON-RESOLVED AND RESOLVED TARGETS IN HIGH CLUTTER BACKGROUNDS. THIS WORK WAS ACCOMPLISHED IN SEVERAL PROGRAMS SPONSORED BY THE AIR FORCE, IN WHICH BASIC ALGORITHM COMPONENTS WERE DEVELOPED, ALGORITHM PERFORMANCE WAS QUANTIFIED ANALYTICALLY AND THEIR OPERATION WAS VERIFIED EXPERIMENTALLY USING RECORDED REAL DATA FROM AIRBORNE SAR AND GROUND-BASED DOPPLER RADARS, AS WELL AS PASSIVE ELECTRO-OPTICAL SENSORS. OUR PROPOSAL IS TO EVOLVE THIS EXISTING TECHNOLOGY TO THE POWERLINE DETECTION PROBLEM. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - THE PHASE I RESEARCH WILL DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY AND POTENTIAL OF THE MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSING APPROACH AND LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR FURTHER ALGORITHM DEVELOPMENT IN A PHASE II PROGRAM USING EXTENSIVE RECORDED SENSOR DATA. THIS RESEARCH WILL ALSO RESULT IN THE DEFINITION OF A LONG TERM PROGRAM TO INTEGRATE THIS TECHNOLOGY INTO MAP UPDATING SYSTEMS.",

THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES OF THE ELEMENT DESIGN ARE WIDELY USED IN MICROWAVE FILTER AND RADOME DESIGNS. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THIS ELEMENT WILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT SIZE REDUCTION (UP TO ONE FOURTH) OVER COMPARABLE UHF SATCOM ELEMENTS DEMONSTRATED TO DATE. THE ELEMENT HAS A HIGH POTENTIAL FOR SOLVING UHF SATCOM NEEDS FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE NAVY AIRCRAFT WITH IMPROVED AXIAL RATIO ON HORIZON AND CONSTANT PATTERN SHAPE OVER THE FREQUENCY BAND. THE APPROACH TAKEN TO DEVELOP AND DEMONSTRATE PERFORMANCE OF THE DESIGN WILL BE BASED ON COMPUTATIONS USING COMPUTER CODES WHICH HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED AND VALIDATED AT ATLANTIC AEROSPACE. THE USE OF COMPREHENSIVE, RIGOROUS, VALIDATED ANALYSIS TO PERFORM ITERATIVE TRADEOFFS BETWEEN SPECIFICATIONS AND DESIGN SENSITIVITIES HAS ADVANTAGES OVER A STRICTLY EMPIRICAL HARDWARE INVESTIGATION. ONE CLEAR ADVANTAGE IS THAT PERFORMANCE TRADES AND MANUFACTURING TOLERANCES CAN BE QUANTIFIED, THUS ALLOWING THE CUSTOMER TO READILY ASSESS TECHNICAL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH FABRICATING PROTOTYPE ELEMENTS IN THE HARDWARE DEMONSTRATION AND VALIDATION, WHICH WILL BE PERFORMED IN PHASE II.",

THE CONCEPT MAKES USE OF RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE ACOUSTIC SENSORS WHICH CAN BE DEPLOYED IN ENEMY TERRITORY BY AIR DROP OR BY ARTILLERY. THE SYSTEM LOCATES TARGETS BY CORRELATING THE ACOUSTIC SIGNALS RECEIVED BY SEVERAL PAIRS OF SENSORS TO DETERMINE TIME DIFFERENCE OF ARRIVAL (TDOA). BASIC SIGNAL PROCESSING IS DONE AT EACH SENSOR TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE ACOUSTIC SIGNATURE BEING RECEIVED CORRESPONDS TO A TARGET OF INTEREST IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE COMMUNICATION TO THE CORRELATION ELEMENT (WHICH CAN BE AN UNATTENDED AIR VEHICLE OR A MANNED AIRCRAFT). THIS MINIMIZES SENSOR EXPOSURE TO INTERCEPT. AN INNOVATIVE TECHIQUE IS DESCRIBED IN THIS PROPOSAL FOR GUIDING A WEAPON TO A TARGET THAT HAS BEEN DETECTED AND CLASSIFIED AS ONE TO BE ENGAGED WITHOUT REQUIRING THAT THE SENSOR LOCATIONS BE EXPLICITLY KNOWN. THIS ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR AUXILIARY METHODS OF DETERMINING SENSOR LOCATIONS AND ALLOWS SENSORS TO BE RAPIDLY DEPLOYED AND UTILIZED. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - THE PROPOSED PHASE I RESEARCH WILL ESTABLISH THE BASIC FEASIBILITY OF THE ACOUSTIC TARGET DETECTION, CLASSIFICATION, LOCATION AND TARGETING CONCEPT.

THIS RESEARCH WILL PROVIDE ACCESS TO THOSE GRAPHIC SCREENS AND THEREFORE ENABLE VISUALLY IMPAIRED PEOPLE TO USE THE SAME APPLICATION PROGRAMS AS SIGHTED PEOPLE. ONCE THE APPROACH FOR DEVELOPING THE GASS HAS BEEN PROVEN EFFECTIVE, THE UTILITY COULD BE DEVELOPED AND FIELD TESTED DURING PHASE II. WITH GASS, VISUALLY IMPAIRED PEOPLE WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE NUMEROUS GRAPHIC-ORIENTED PROGRAMS. WITHOUT GASS, THEY WILL LOSE ACCESS TO ALL BUT THE MOST SIMPLE VISUALLY FORMATTED PROGRAMS.

AVCA CORPORATION HAS DONE PRELIMINARY DESIGN WORK ON A METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR GENERATING THIN FILMS BY LEVITATIONOF ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTIVE MATERIALS IN AN ELECTROMAGNETIC CONTAINMENT DEVICE AND TRANSFERS THEM TO A FERROUS SUBSTRATEPASSING UNDER THE DEVICE ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS AS A REPLACEMENT FOR CSEP. A QUESTION THAT MUST BE ANSWERED BEFORE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE LEVITATION PORTION OF THE DESIGN TAKES PLACE IS THE QUALITY OF THE BOND ACHIEVED BY THE DIRECT APPLICATION OF A LIQUID METAL TO A RELATIVELY COLD FERROUS SUBSTRATE. PRELIMINARY RESEARCH INDICATES THAT SUCH BONDS ARE WORTHWHILE. AVCA CORPORATION HAS DESIGNED A SUPPLEMENTAL PROCESS OF ENHANCING THESE BONDS THAT CAN BE DEVETAILED INTO THE LEVITATION PORTION OF ITS DESIGN THAT INVOLVES RELIQUEFACTION OF THE FILM WHILE SUBJECTING THE SUBSTRATE TOA STRONG MAGNETOSTRICTIVE EFFECT. THIS RESEARCH PROPOSAL INVOLVES THE CONSTRUCTION OF A BENCH TOP DEVICE FOR TESTING THE MAGNETOSTRICTIVE INTERACTION AND FOR MODELLING THE ENTIRE PROCESS FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING INSTRUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE PRINCIPAL PURPOSE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP SOLUTION METHODS FOR INITIAL AND/OR BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEMS FOR DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS BASED ON THE RECENTLY DISCOVERED WAVELET BASIS FUNCTIONS. THE BASIS FUNCTIONS HAVE PROPERTIES OF ORTHOGONALITY, LOCAL SUPPORT, SCALING BEHAVIOR, AND INHERENTLY PARALLELIZABLE ALGORITHMS FOR COMPUTER IMPLEMENTATION, WHICH MAKES THEM VERY SUITABLE FOR MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS. AN ADDITIONAL PURPOSE OF THE PROPOSAL IS TO CONTINUE THE INVESTIGATION OF THE THEORETICAL AND NUMERICAL PROPERTIES OF WAVELETS. FROM THE INTRINSIC ASYMMETRY OF WAVELETS, THEY SEEM TO BE WELL-SUITED FOR THE SIMULATION OF HIGHLY ADVECTED PHENOMENA. THIS PROGRAM OF USING WAVELETS FOR NUMERICAL SOLUTIONS OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS WILL BE CARRIED OUT IN SEVERAL PHASES. THE FIRST PHASE WILL CONCERN THE PROBLEM OF ONE AND TWO-DIMENSIONAL SCALAR EQUATIONS, BOTH LINEAR AND NON-LINEAR IN NATURE. THE LATER PHASES WILL INCLUDE VECTOR-VALUED PROBLEMS ARISING IN FLUID DYNAMICS, FIELD THEORY AND FINITE CLASTICITY. MORE SPECIFICALLY IN PHASE I WE SHALL ADDRESS THE SOLUTION OF LINEAR ELLIPTIC BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEMS IN DIMENSION 1 AND 2, INCLUDING SITUATIONS WHERE THE SOLUTION EXHIBITS BOUNDARY LAYERS. WE SHALL ALSO INVESTIGATE THE WAVELET SOLUTION OF LINEAR AND NONLINEAR TIME-DEPENDENT PROBLEMS SUCH AS THE HEAT EQUATION, THE LINEAR ADVECTION EQUATION, THE BUCKLEY-LEVERETT EQUATIONS, AND THE KURAMOTO-SHIVASHINSKY EQUATION. COMPARISON WILL BE MADE WITH MORE CLASSICAL SOLUTION METHODS BASED, FOR INSTANCE, ON FINITE-DIFFERENCE AND FINITE ELEMENT METHODS. MOREOVER, THE DEPENDENCE OF THE WAVELET SYSTEMS ON THE WAVELET COEFFICIENT, IN PARTICULAR, AND THE DIFFERENTIABILITY PROPERTIES OF WAVELETS WILL BE STUDIED.",

A PROGRAM IS PROPOSED TO: (1) SPECIFY AN APPROACH, USING ONE OR MORE DIAGNOSTICS, FOR MEASURING AFP TO AN ACCURACY OF ONE POROSITY UNIT (1 PU) AND (2) TO DEVELOP A FORMATION DENSITY/LITHOLOGY LOGGING TOOL WHICH WILL FORM A KEY ELEMENT OF THE SPECIFIED MEASUREMENT APPROACH. THE PROPOSED TOOL USES A LINEAR INDUCTION ACCELERATOR (LIA) TO GENERATE A HIGH ENERGY X-RAY BEAM. IT IS SIMILAR TO EXISTING GAMMA-GAMMA LOGGING TOOLS WITH THE FOLLOWING IMPORTANT EXCEPTIONS: (1) THE X-RAY ENERGIES EXTEND UP TO ?4 MEV, THUS FACILITATING MUCH GREATER DEPTHS OF INVESTIGATION; (2) THE STAND-OFF DISTANCE OF THE X-RAY SOURCE AND THE DETECTORS FROM THE BOREHOLE WALL CAN BE SMALLER; (3) THE X-RAY SOURCE WILL HAVE A MUCH HIGHER INTENSITY WHICH HELPS TO INCREASE THE STATISTICAL ACCURACY AND (4) IT DOESN'T CONTAIN RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL, THUS SIMPLIFYING HANDLING AND TRANSPORTATION. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF PHASE I IS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF NEW TECHNIQUES FOR MEASURING AFP TO AN ACCURACY OF 1 PU. THIS OBJECTIVE WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY PERFORMING THE FOLLOWING TASKS: (1) EVALUATE NEW AND EXISTING DIAGNOSTICS FOR DETERMINING AFP AND ESTABLISH THE REQUIREMENTS FOR AN IMPROVED APPROACH; (2) DEVELOP THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN FOR AN EXPERIMENTAL HIGH ENERGY X-RAY TOOL WHICH WOULD BE CONSTRUCTED IN PHASE II AND (3) DEVELOP AND TEST THE KEY PORTION OF THE X-RAY TOOL IN ORDER TO DEMONSTRATE ITS FEASIBILITY. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE AN ADVANCED LOGGING TOOL FOR MEASURING BOTH DENSITY AND LITHOLOGY IN GEOLOGICAL FORMATIONS WITH SUPERIOR DEPTHS OF INVESTIGATION. IT WILL HAVE IMPORTANT APPLICATIONS IN THE PRECISE MEASUREMENT OF AFP ABOVE AND BELOW THE WATER TABLE. IT WILL ALSO HAVE COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS IN THE LOGGING OF OIL AND GAS WELLS.",

WE PROPOSE TO DECREASE TRAINING TIME BY INTRODUCING MORPHOLOGICALLY BASED RECONFIGURABLE SAMPLING ARRAYS. WE WILL INCREASE THE FAULT TOLERANCE OR ROBUSTNESS OF OBJECT DETECTION TASKS BY INTRODUCING A HYBIRD MODEL THAT INCORPORATES ROBUST FILTERING PRIOR TO THE ANN INPUT. THERE ARE TWO PROBLEMS IN THIS AREA WE WOULD LIKE TO INVESTIGATE. AN OBVIOUS STEP IN DECREASING TRAINING TIME IS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF INPUTS AND THEREFORE THE NUMBER OF INTERCONNECTS. WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERCONNECTION OF SENSORS ON MORPHOLOGICAL \"SHAPING\" CONSIDERATIONS AND PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF THE OBJECT OF INTEREST. THE SECOND PROBLEM WE WISH TO INVESTIGATE IS AN INCREASE IN THE ROBUTNESS OF ANNS FOR BOTH IMPULSIVE NOISE AND VARYING SENSOR OUTPUT AMPLITUDES DUE TO VARYING INPUT INTENSITIES. WE WILL EXAMINE IMPULSIVE NOISE VIA THE USE OF ORDER STATISTIC (OS) FILTERS SUCH AS THE MEDIAN AFTER AN MORPHOLOGICALLY BASED INTERCONNTECTION OF THE SENSORS. WE WILL APPROACH THE PROBLEM OF VARYING INTENSITIES BY RENORMALIZATION OF THE INPUTS FROM THE MORPHOLOGICALLY SELECTED SET OF SENSORS TO THE ANN.",

THE SYSTEM IS CONVENIENT ENOUGH TO REACH INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD BENEFIT FROM STRESS REDUCTION TREATMENT, BUT ARE UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO ATTEND FACE-TO-FACE TREATMENTS. THE SYSTEM IS AVAILABLE 24 HOURS DAILY, ANY PLACE A TOUCH-TONE TELEPHONE IS AVAILABLE. IT \"SPEAKS\" TO CALLERS USING DIGITIZED SPEECH. CALLERS REPLY USING THE TOUCH-TONE KEY PAD. THE SYSTEM TAILORS TREATMENT SPECIFICALLY TO EACH USER, BASED ON THE REPLIES THAT THE USER HAS ENTERED IN PAST CALLS. PARTICIPANTS CAN BEGIN TREATMENT WHENEVER THEY ARE READY, ACCESS THE SYSTEM WHEN THEY ARE MOST RECEPTIVE TO IT, AND STAY IN TREATMENT FOR AS LONG AS THEY WISH. THE SYSTEM REQUIRES LITTLE PROFESSIONAL TIME TO REACH A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS. THE PHASE I PERIOD WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE WHAT FEATURES OF A COMPUTERIZED STRESS REDUCTION PROGRAM MAXIMIZE USER PARTICIPATION AND SATISFACTION. PHASE I RESEARCH WILL MEASURE THE EFFECT OF BEHAVIORAL ASSIGNMENTS, SUPPORTIVE COMMENTS, AND CONTROL OVER THE DIRECTION OF THE PROGRAM UPON THE USERS' SATISFACTION AND CONTINUED USE OF THE SYSTEM.",

HOWEVER, THE CURRENT SALES OF MEMBRANE SYSTEMS FOR THESE APPLICATIONS IS ONLY A FEW TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS--PRIMARILY BECAUSE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE MEMBRANES CANNOT WITHSTAND EXPOSURE TO THE HYDROCARBONS AND SOLVENTS OFTEN PRESENT IN INDUSTRIAL GAS PROCESS STREAMS. THE PURPOSE OF THE WORK PROPOSED HERE IS TO DEVELOP A NEW GENERATION OF CHEMICALLY INERT MEMBRANES. SPECIFICALLY, THESE WILL BE THIN-FILM-COMPOSITE (TFC) MEMBRANES IN WHICH CONVENTIONAL HIGH-PERFORMANCE MEMBRANE FILMS WILL BE SUPPORTED BY A NOVEL POLYMERIC MICROPOROUS SUPPORT HAVING CHEMICAL RESISTANCE FAR SURPASSING ANY POLYMER SUPPORTS NOW AVAILABLE. THIS NEW SUPPORT MATERIAL WILL BE INSOLUBLE IN ALL NORMAL SOLVENTS AND WILL RESIST PLASTICIZATION AND OTHER PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH CURRENT POLYMERIC SUPPORTS. DEVELOPMENT OF THIS SUPPORT IS THE FOCUS OF THE PROPOSED PROGRAM. THE RESULTING COMPOSITE MEMBRANE IS EXPECTED TO PERMIT CONSIDERABLE EXPANSION OF THE CURRENTLY LIMITED MEMBRANE MARKET. PHASE I WILL BE AIMED AT PROVING THAT SUITABLE SUPPORTS--I.E., SOLVENT-RESISTANT SUPPORTS WITH THE HIGH PERMEABILITY, STRENGTH, AND CHARACTERISTICS NECESSARY TO SUPPORT INTERFACIAL FILMS--CAN BE FABRICATED. OPTIMIZATION OF THESE SUPPORTS AND FABRICATION OF TFC MEMBRANES AND MODULES WILL BE CARRIED OUT IN PHASE II, ALONG WITH BENCH- AND FIELD-TESTING THAT WILL ESTABLISH MODULE PERFORMANCE.

EDTA, HOWEVER, COMPLEXES WITH INNOCUOUS METAL IONS (CALCIUM, MAGNESIUM, IRON), AND EDTA- HEAVY METAL COMPLEXES ARE DIFFICULT TO REMOVE FROM THE AQUEOUS PHASE. BIO-RECOVERY SYSTEMS HAS DEVELOPED A PROPRIETARY PROCESS TO CIRCUMVENT THESE DIFFICULTIES USING ACHELATING AGENT (MLA) WHICH HAS LITTLE OR NO AFFINITY FOR INNOCUOUS METAL IONS WHICH HAS A HIGHER AFFINITY FOR MANY TOXIC METAL IONS THAN DOES EDTA. FURTHERMORE, THE HEAVY METAL-MLA COMPLEXES CAN BE REMOVED FROM THE AQUEOUS PHASE BYSORPTION ON ALGASORB RESINS, A PROPRIETARY BIOMASS DEVELOPEDBY BIO-RECOVERY. THUS, THE USE OF MLA AS A SOIL WASHING AGENT AND THE USE OF ALGASORB WILL BE TESTED TO RECOVER THE MLA METAL ION COMPLEXES IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN IF THIS APPROACH WILL YIELD A MORE COST EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR METAL-CONTAMINATED SOILS AT SUPERFUND SITES THAN CURRENT METHODS.

A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF THE TREE CAN BE UTILIZED THROUGH IMPROVED OR NEW TECHNIQUES OF COMMINUTION SO THAT NEW OR IMPROVED RECONSTITUTED PRODUCTS CAN BE MADE. THE INTENT OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP AN IMPROVED TECHNIQUE OF COMMINUTION WHICH CAN BE USED TO EFFECTIVELY DEFIBRATE AND FRACTIONATE WOODY BIOMASS INTO ITS VARIOUS CONSTITUENTS SO THAT THEY CAN BE READILY AND ECONOMICALLY CONVERTED INTO MARKETABLE PRODUCTS. CURRENTLY, STREAM EXPLOSION IS ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING METHODS OF PRETREATING AND FRACTIONATING WOODY BIOMASS WASTE. HOWEVER, THIS PROCESS HAS SEVERAL DISADVANTAGES INCLUDING DEGRADATION OF CELLULOSE AND HEMICELLULOSES, LOSS OF BRIGHTNESS, DETERIORATION OF FIBER STRENGTH, REDUCTION INYIELD, AND OPERATING COST REQUIREMENTS. WE PROPOSE TO IMPROVE ON THE STEAM EXPLOSION PROCESS BY USING SUPERCRITICAL OR NEAR-CRITICAL FLUIDS WHICH HAVE THE COMBINED CAPABILITY TO DEFIBRATE BIOMASS AT LOWER OPERATING TEMPERATURES AND TO FRACTIONATE WOOD INTO ITS CONSTITUENTS. AN IMPROVED PRETREATMENT PROCESS FOR BIOMASS WASTE WILL FACILITATE THE PRODUCTION OF ETHANOL, GASOHOL AND OTHER CHEMICALS FROM WOODY BIOMASS WASTES, AND UNDERUTILIZED RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCE. THE IMPROVED PROCESS WILL BE OF UTILITY TO THE HARDBOARD AND CONSTRUCTION PAPER INDUSTRIES, AND MAY FIND USE IN THE WASTE PAPER RECYCLING INDUSTRY. AN IMPROVED PROCESS COULD ALSO LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ALTERNATE PULPING PROCESS WHICH PRODUCES A SUPERIOR CELLULOSIC FIBER, REDUCES CHEMICAL USAGE IN THE PULP AND PAPER INDUSTRY, AND MINIMIZES THE IMPACT OF SPENT PULPING LIQUORS ON OUR ENVIRONMENT.",

THE DESIGN OF THE INSTRUMENT WILL ALLOW FOR THE RECORDING OF THE FEMALE GENITAL TRACT, IN PARTICULAR THE CERVIX, WHICH CAN BE SUBSEQUENTLY EXAMINED UNDER A MICROSCOPE WITH RESOLUTION COMPARABLE TO THAT OBTAINED IN PATHOLOGICAL AND HISTOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS. THE METHOD UTILIZES CONTACT HOLOGRAPHIC RECORDING OF STAINED TISSUE. THE MAJOR ADVANTAGES OF THE TECHNIQUE OVER SIMILAR TECHNIQUES IN MICROHYSTEROSCOPY AND MICROCOLPOSCOPY ARE A DRAMATIC REDUCTION IN PHYSICIAN AND PATIENT TIME (THE RECORDING REQUIRES A FRACTION OF A SECOND), AND THE AVAILABILITY OF A PERMANENT RECORD TO BE EXAMINED MICROSCOPICALLY. A SINGLE HOLOGRAPHIC RECORD IS ADEQUATE TO RENDER DETAILS OF THE ORGANIZATION AND SIZE OF CELLS. THE DESIGN OF THE INSTRUMENT WILL INCLUDE A DISPOSABLE FILM CARTRIDGE AND A SMALL PORTABLE SOURCE FOR LASER-LIGHT ILLUMINATION. THE INSTRUMENT WILL BE DESIGNED IN A MANNER AND SHAPE THAT ARE COMPATIBLE WITH CURRENT INSTRUMENTATION IN COLPOSCOPY. DURING PHASE I, THE MAIN FEATURES OF THE DESIGN WILL BE DEMONSTRATED AND THE ADEQUACY OF THE HOLOGRAPHIC RECORD IN THE MICROSCOPIC EVALUATION OF TISSUE WILL BE ESTABLISHED.",

USING AN ELECTRONIC SENSOR TO CAPTURE THE IMAGE IN A DIGITAL FORMAT OFFERS SEVERAL ADVANTAGES OVER FILM-BASED SYSTEMS: (1) A DIGITAL SYSTEM REQUIRES NO PROCESSING SYSTEM, MAKING IMMEDIATE VIEWING OF THE X-RAY POSSIBLE; (2) BECAUSE THE IMAGE IS IN DIGITAL FORMAT, IMAGE-PROCESSING ROUTINES CAN BE USED TO ANALYZE OR ENHANCE THE IMAGE; (3) THE COST OF STORING AND RETRIEVING THE IMAGE IS REDUCED AND TRANMISSION TO REMOTE LOCATIONS IS POSSIBLE; AND (4) GREATER SENSITIVITY OF ELECTRONIC SENSORS SHOULD MAKE POSSIBLE A REDUCTION OF X-RAY DOSE TO THE PATIENT. IN PHASE I, THE ELECTRONIC IMAGING SYSTEM WILL BE EVALUATED AS TO IMAGE QUALITY, MAGNIFICATION, DISTORTION, AND PATIENT-ABSORBED DOSE.

ONE LIKELY METHOD FOR REDUCING DEVICE-RELATED INFECTIONS IS TO BOND A COATING TO THE MATERIAL THAT WILL REPEL MICROBIAL ATTACHMENT AND COLONIZATION. PRELIMINARY RESULTS SHOW THAT COVALENTLY COUPLED COATINGS REDUCE BACTERIAL COLONIZATION OF POLYSTYRENE. IN THIS PHASEI EFFORT, IT IS PLANNED TO IMMOBILIZE THESE COATINGS TO CONTACT LENS MATERIALS AND TO INVESTIGATE THE ABILITY OF THESE COATINGS TO REDUCE MICROBIAL ADHERENCE AND PROLIFERATION.

IN ADDITION, STUDIES WILL BE INITIATED TO INCORPORATE INTO THE LUBRICOUS COATING A SYSTEMTHAT SLOWLY RELEASES ANTIBIOTICS. THE ANTIBIOTICS SHOULD FURTHER IMPROVE THE MICROBIAL RESISTANCE OF THE URINARY CATHETER. THE TWO MOST COMMONLY USED TYPES OF URINARY CATHETERS (LATEXAND SILICONE) WILL BE COATED WITH REAGENTS THAT HAVE IMPROVED WETTABILITY AND REDUCED BACTERIA COLONIZATION WHEN IMMOBILIZED ONTO OTHER POLYMERS. THEN THE COATED CATHETERS WILL BE EVALUATED IN VITRO FOR IMPROVED WETTABILITY, LUBRICITY, AND RESISTANCE TO BACTERIA COLONIZATION.

THE AIMS OF THIS PHASE I PROJECT WILL BE TO SYNTHESIZE THESEPHOTOACTIVATIBLE, \"SLIPPERY\" POLYMERS; DEMONSTRATE PHOTOIMMOBILIZATION OF THESE DERIVATIVES TO STANDARD MEDICAL DEVICE MATERIALS; AND MEASURE THE REDUCED COEFFICIENT OF FRICTION PRODUCED BY THESE COATINGS. THE RESEARCH WILL NOT FOCUS ON A PARTICULAR MEDICAL DEVICE DURING PHASE I, BUT WILL DEMONSTRATE THE GENERIC APPLICABILITY OF THIS TECHNOLOGY TO A RANGE OF POLYMERIC MATERIALS. COMPARISONS WILL BE MADE TO NONMODIFIED, PLASMA-TREATED, AND CURRENT COMMERCIAL COATING MATERIALS. DURING PHASE II, IT IS PLANNED TO IMPROVE AND OPTIMIZE THE PHOTOIMMOBILIZATION PROCESS AND TO DEMONSTRATE THE COMPATIBILITY OF THESE COATINGS IN ANIMAL IMPLANT STUDIES.",

ETHIDIUM BROMIDE IS A POTENT INHIBITOR OF MANY OF THE ENZYMES COMMONLY USED IN SUBSEQUENT CLONING STEPS OR PCR.

MOST DIAGNOSTIC TECHNIQUES AVAILABLE TO CLINICIANS CANNOT PREDICT FUTURE ATTACHMENT LOSS. COLLAGENASE IN GCF IS AN IMPORTANT MARKER OF DISEASE ACTIVITY, BUT PREVIOUS METHODS HAVE BEEN UNSUITABLE FOR CLINICAL USE. BIOSTAR MEDICAL PRODUCTS, INC., WILL DEVELOP OIA TECHNOLOGY FOR THE DIRECT PHYSICAL DETECTION OF COLLAGENASE ACTIVITY. THIS TECHNOLOGY EXPLOITS THE OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF THIN FILMS OF BIOMOLECULES ON A PATENTED TEST PIECE; AS THICKNESSDECREASES DUE TO ENZYMATIC DIGESTION, A COLOR CHANGE OCCURS. RESULTS WILL BE AVAILABLE IN MINUTES. EASE OF USE AND LOW COST MAKE IT SUITABLE FOR OFFICE USE. RESULTS WILL BE SEMIQUANTITATIVE, DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN HEALTH, GINGIVITIS, AND ACTIVE PERIODONTITIS. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF PHASE I ARE TO DETERMINE THE BEST METHOD FOR IMMOBILIZING COLLAGEN ON THE TEST PIECE SO PURE COLLAGENASE CAN MEASURABLY DEGRADE IT, AND TO DETERMINE THE CONDITIONS THAT ALLOW DIFFERENTIATION OF CLINICALLY RELEVANTENZYME LEVELS. THE PROTOTYPE DEVELOPED IN PHASE I WILL BE EVALUATED AND MODIFIED DURING CLINICAL STUDIES IN PHASE II DEVELOPMENT.",

THIS PROPOSED WORK EXPLORES INCORPORATING CBR TECHNIQUES IN MIXED-PARADIGM KNOWLEDGE-BASED APPLICATIONS. IN MANY POTENTIAL CBR APPLICATIONS, CBR APPROACHES ALONE ARE INSUFFICIENT AND MUST BE COMBINED WITH OTHER PROBLEM-SOLVING TECHNIQUES IN A MIXED-PARADIGM CBR FRAMEWORK. OUR APPROACH TO MIXED-PARADIGM CBR IS TO USE A BLACKBOARD ARCHITECTURE AS AN INTEGRATION FRAMEWORK FOR CASE-BASED KNOWLEDGE SOURCES (KSS) OPERATING WITH KSS USING OTHER PROBLEM-SOLVING APPROACHES. THE OPPORTUNISTIC CONTROL CAPABILITIES OF THE BLACKBOARD PARADIGM ARE WELL SUITED TO MIXED-PARADIGM PROBLEM SOLVING. CBR AND THE BLACKBOARD PARADIGM ALSO SHARE FEATURES THAT FACILITATE AND EXTEND THE CAPABILITIES OF SUCH INTEGRATION BEYOND THE MERE SUPPORT OF KSS EMPLOYING CBR TECHNIQUES. THESE SIMILARITIES INCLUDE: INDEXING AND RETRIEVAL (CASE S AND BLACKBOARD OBJECTS), RELATIVELY LARGE-GRAINED CONTROL DECISIONS (CASE SELECTION AND KS EXECUTION) WE WILL BUILD ON THESE SIMILARITIES TO DEVELOP A FLEXIBLE, MIXED-PARADIGM CBR FRAMEWORK BASED ON THE BLACKBOARD ARCHITECTURE. IN THE PROCESS WE WILL ADDRESS ISSUES IN CBR INDEXING AND RETRIEVAL AND IN CONTROL OF MIXED-PARADIGM CBR APPLICATIONS. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - THE PROPOSED WORK WILL RESULT IN A FLEXIBLE FRAMEWORK FOR MIXED-PARADIGM CBR APPLICATIONS BASED ON THE BLACKBOARD ARCHITECTURE. IT WILL EXPAND THE USE OF CBR TO APPLICATION AREAS THAT ARE NOT COMPLETELY SUITED TO CBR TECHNIQUES AND WILL INCREASE UNDERSTANDING OF THE SYNERGY BETWEEN CBR AND OTHER PROBLEM-SOLVING PARADIGMS. THE WORK WILL ALSO PROVIDE EXAMPLES OF MIXED-PARADIGM CBR APPLICATIONS. MIXED-PARADIGM CBR IS EXPECTED TO PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN FUTURE GOVERNMENT AND COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS.",

IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE REQUIRED SMALL GEOMETRIES AND HIGH YIELDS, STRINGENT DEMANDS WILL BE MADE ON RESIST TECHNOLOGY. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANY ELECTRON-BEAM RESISTS WHICH HAVE SUBMICRON RESOLUTION, NONE OF THEM TOTALLY MEET ALL PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS. DUE TO THE INHERENT CHARACTERISTICS OF HIGH GLASS TRANSITION TEMPERATURE, EFFECTIVE ADHESION, THERMAL STABILITY, AND DRY ETCHING DURABILITY OF AROMATIC SILICON-CONTAINING POLYMER AND THE HIGH RADIATION SENSITIVITY OF CHLOROMETHYL STYRENE, COPOLYMERS OF CHLOROMETHYL STYRENE AND SEVERAL AROMATIC SILICON-CONTAINING MONOMERS WILL BE INVESTIGATED AS HIGH RESOLUTION ELECTRON-BEAM BILAYER RESISTS. THE RESIST SENSITIVITY IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE MOLECULAR WEIGHT OF THE COPOLYMER AND MUTUALLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH RESOLUTION, WHICH IS A FUNCTION OF POLYDISPERSITY. IMPROVEMENT OF ADHESION, THERMAL STABILITY, AND DRY ETCHING DURABILITY IS OFTEN AT THE EXPENSE OF SENSITIVITY. THUS, THE EFFECTS OF THE MOLECULAR STRUCTURE AND THE SYNTHETIC PARAMETERS ON THESE PROPERTIES WILL BE STUDIED. AS THE LITHOGRAPHIC PROCESS IS VITAL FOR DEVELOPING A NEW SUBMICRON RESIST SYSTEM, THE PROCESSING PARAMETERS WILL BE OPTIMIZED FOR THE CHLOROMETHYLSTYRENE AND AROMATIC SILICON-CONTAINING COPOLYMER WITH OPTIMUM MOLECULAR DESIGN IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A THERMALLY STABLE AND DRY ETCHING RESISTANT ELECTRON-BEAM RESIST WITH HIGH SENSITIVITY AND RESOLUTION.",

PRACTICAL CIRCUIT SOLUTIONS FOR VARIOUS APPLICATIONS WILL BE INVESTIGATED (FORM, FIT AND ELECTRICAL DESIGN, APPROACH AND COST). EXTENSION OF THE THEORY TO OTHER ANTENNAS WILL BE INVESTIGATED, INCLUDING DIPOLE-DERIVED ANTENNAS, E.G. FOLDED OR SLEEVE DIPOLES, DIPOLE ARRAYS, ETC. POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS WILL ALSO BE EXAMINED.

AN INNOVATIVE CLOSED, INSULATED PALLET SYSTEM (CIPS) HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO MEET THESE CHALLENGES, INCLUDING: 1)ELIMINATION OF PRODUCTION RELATED POLLUTION (I.E. WASTEWATER DISCHARGE AND AERIAL DRIFT); 2) REDUCTION AND CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, CHEMICAL, SOIL AND WATER; 3)ELIMINATION OF MARKED, SEASONAL FLUCTUATION IN LABOR REQUIREMENT AND TOTAL LABOR REQUIREMENT THROUGH PALLETIZATION AND MECHANIZATION; 4)EFFECTIVE INTEGRATION OF BIOLOGICAL CONTROLS, BENEFICIAL MICROORGANISMS AND IMPROVEMENT OF PLANT PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT THEREBY ENHANCING PLANT'S ABILTIY TO WITHSTAND PATHOGENS AND INSC INSECTS; 5)PLANT ROOT PROTECTION FROM TEMPERATURE EXTREMES AND FLUCTUATIONS; AND 6)MORE EFFICIENT PLANT HANDLING AND SHIPPING. ABILITY OF CIPS TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES WILL BE STUDIED BY AN INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH TEAM FROM OREGONSTATE UNIVERSITY, OREGON GRADUATE CENTER AND USDA HORTICULTURAL CROPS RESEARCH LABORATORY COOPERATING WITH BRIGGS NURSERY STAFF TO : EVALUATE ALTERNATIVE CONSTRUCTIONMATERIALS; EVALUATE EFFECT OF VOLUME HEAT CAPACITY AND INSULATION CHARACTERISTICS ON UNIFORM, VIABLE ROOTZONE TEMPERATURE MAINTENANCE; ESTABLISH STABLE, ROOTZONE CHEMICALAND MOISTURE GRADIENTS AND BENEFICIAL MICROORGANISMS IN UNIQUE ROOTZONE NICHES; EVALUATE PLANT PATHOGEN EPIDEMIOLOGY. IF, THROUGH RESEARCH, HYPOTHESIZED PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ADVANTAGES OF CIPS CAN BE REALIZED, INDUSTRY ADOPTION OF CIPS WOULD DRASTICALLY REDUCE WATER, CHEMICAL, ENERGY INPUTS INTO GREENHOUSE AND NURSERY CROP PRODUCTION AND WOULD ELIMINATE PRODUCTION RELATED POLLUTION. WOULD REDUCE WATER AND FERTILIZER UP TO 80%; ELIMINATE NURSERY OVERWINTERING COSTS (STRUCTURES AND PLANT MOVEMENT);DECREASE GREENHOUSE HEATING COSTS/ENERGY 60% OR MORE; INCREASE RELIABILITY OF ESTABLISHMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF BENEFICIAL BIOLOGICAL ORGANISMS IN ROOT ZONE AND EXPEDITE INTEGRATION OF BIOLOGICAL CONTROLS; FACILITATE MYCORRHIZAE AND OTHER BENEFICIAL MICROORGANISMS IN PRODUCTION SYSTEM TO INCREASE TRANSPLANT SURVIVAL.",

THE PROPOSEDSTUDY WILL MAKE USE OF A NOVEL TECHNIQUE TO VISUALIZE 'INSITU' THE SOLID LIQUID INTERFACE, WHICH WAS RECENTLY DEVELOPED AT BRIMROSE (REF. 3). THIS TECHNIQUE IS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF INFRARED IMAGING. IT USES DIFFERENCE IN EMISSIVITIES OF SOLID AND LIQUID TO OBTAIN DEMARCATION BETWEEN SOLID AND LIQUID. AT THE SAME TIME IT ALSO WORKS INRADIOGRAPHIC MODE DEPENDING UPON THE INFRARED TRANSMISSION RANGE OF THE MATERIAL IN QUESTION. THE MODEL MATERIAL CHOSEN FOR THESE EXPERIMENTS IS NAC1 BECAUSE OF ITS WIDE IR TRANSMISSION RANGE (0.2UM - 26UM) AND VERY WELL UNDERSTOOD PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES. THE INFRARED IMAGING OF THE SOLIDIFICATION PROCESS WILL BE CARRIED OUT USING THE INFRARED IMAGING SYSTEM OPERATING IN THE RANGE OF 3-5UM. THIS TECHNIQUE WILL ALLOW FOR THE FIRST TIME AN 'INSITU' STUDY OF THE EFFECT OF GRAVITY DRIVEN CONVECTION ON THE SOLID-LIQUID INTERFACE. THIS TECHNIQUE IS (1) NON-INTRUSIVE AND NON-DESTRUCTIVE IN NATURE, (2) PERMITS SAFE USE WITHOUT REQUIRING ANY SPECIAL PRECAUTION, AND (3) AMENABLE TO BOTH GROUND BASED EXPERIMENTS AND EXPERIMENTATION IN THE SPACE SHUTTLE.",

ATYPICAL (NON-BETA1, BETA2) BETA-ADRENERGIC RECEPTORS (BETA-ARS) ARE THOUGHT TO MEDIATE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM STIMULATION OF THERMOGENESIS. ATYPICAL BETA- AGONISTS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO STIMULATE THERMOGENESIS AND PROMOTE WEIGHT LOSS IN ANIMAL MODELS AND IN HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS, BUT DESPITE THEIR RELATIVE SELECTIVITY, INTERACTIONS WITH BETA1-AR AND BETA2-AR PRODUCE SIDE EFFECTS. IMPROVEMENTS IN AGONIST SELECTIVITY FOR STIMULATION OF THERMOGENESIS WOULD LEAD TO USEFUL THERAPEUTICS. THE SPECIFIC AIM OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO ESTABLISH A SCREENING SYSTEM FOR SELECTIVE THERMOGENIC BETA-AGONISTS. DURING PHASE I, THE POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (PCR) AND MOLECULAR CLONING TECHNIQUES WILL BE EMPLOYED TO IDENTIFY AND ISOLATE GENES FOR ATYPICAL BETA-ARS EXPRESSED IN TISSUESTHAT ARE SITES FOR THERMOGENESIS IN HUMANS. DURING PHASE II, THE GENES FOR ATYPICAL BETA-ARS WILL BE INTRODUCED INTO CHINESE HAMSTER OVARY CELLS TO ESTABLISH A MATRIX OF CELL LINES EXPRESSING FUNCTIONAL ATYPICAL RECEPTORS, WHICH WILL THEN BE USED TO SCREEN POTENTIAL THERMOGENIC AGONISTS.",

THIS SPECIFICITY SUGGESTS THAT VEGF MAY BE AN IDEAL HUMAN THERAPEUTIC AGENT FOR INDICATIONS WHERE RE-ENDOTHELIALIZATION IS DESIRED IN THE ABSENCE OF PROLIFERATION BY OTHER CELL TYPES; FOR EXAMPLE, AFTER BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY (PERCUTANEOUS TRANSLUMINAL CORONARY ANGIOPLASTY) OR IN CONJUNCTION WITH VASCULAR GRAFTING. THE LONG-RANGE GOALS OF THE PROJECT ARE TO ESTABLISH A RECOMBINANT SOURCE FOR HUMAN VEGF, AND TO USE THE RECOMBINANT PROTEIN TO DETERMINE IN ANIMAL MODELS AND (IF INDICATED) HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS THE EFFICACY OF VEGF FOR INDICATIONS INVOLVING VASCULAR RE-ENDOTHELIALIZATION. THE PHASE I GOALS ARE TO: (1) USE N-TERMINAL PROTEIN SEQUENCE INFORMATION ALREADY OBTAINED TO ISOLATE BOVINE AND HUMAN CLONES FOR THE VEGF CODING REGION; AND (2) USE EXPRESSION OF THE CLONES, AND INACTIVATION EXPERIMENTS USINGANTIPEPTIDE ANTIBODIES, TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE SEQUENCE OBTAINED INDEED REPRESENTS THE N-TERMINUS OF THE VEGF PROTEIN, AND TO INITIATE RECOMBINANT PRODUCTION.",

THIS RECEPTOR (PDGFR-B) IS LOCALIZED ON THE CELL SURFACE. HOWEVER, HTLV-I-INFECTED T-CELL LINES EXPRESS ONLY A 4.8-KB PDGFR-B MRNA THAT CODES FOR A PROTEIN THAT IS LOCALIZED INTRACELLULARLY. AN IDENTICAL 4.8-KB PDGFR-B MRNA HAS BEEN DETECTED IN ONE HIV-INFECTED T-CELL LINE TESTED, BUT ONLY THE 5.5-KB MRNA SPECIES IN B-LYMPHOCYTIC LINES INFECTED WITH THE DNA-VIRUS, EPSTEIN-BARR. CHANGES IN THE SIZE OF PDGFR-B MRNA IN LYMPHOCYTES BEFORE AND AFTER RETROVIRUS INFECTION WILL BE MONITORED, AND THE PDGFR-B PROTEIN WILL BE IDENTIFIED AND SUBCELLULARLY LOCALIZED. EXPRESSION OF PDGFR-B MRNAS WILL BE DETECTED BY NORTHERN HYBRIDIZATION ANALYSIS USING A SPECIFIC PDGFR-B CDNA PROBE. THE PRESENCE AND MOLECULAR SIZE OF PDGFR-B PROTEIN IN INFECTED CELLS WILL BE DETECTED BY INDIRECT IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE AND RADIOIMMUNOPRECIPITATION. THE RESULTS WILL INDICATE WHETHER HUMAN LYMPHOCYTE TRANSFORMATION BY RETROVIRUSES CORRELATES WITH THE EXPRESSION OF ABERRANT PDGRF-B MRNAS OF DIFFERENT SIZES AND CONSEQUENTLY DIFFERENT PDGFR-B PROTEINS.",

HOWEVER, MICROSTRUCTURAL DESIGN COUPLED WITH CONTROLLED PROCESSING IS REQUIRED TO FORM RELIABLE MATERIALS THAT CAN BE SAFELY APPLIED FOR INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS. A NOVEL PROCESSING APPROACH IS PROPOSED FOR FABRICATING DENSE, NEAR-NET SHAPE SIC WHISKER REINFORCED SI3N4 COMPOSITES. IT INVOLVES REDUCING FLAWS ORIGINATING FROM PROCESSING AND SIMULTANEOUSLY INTRODUCING TOUGHENING MECHANISMS. HIGH PRESSURE, QUASI-ISOSTATIC LOWER TEMPERATURE CONSOLIDATION WILL BE EMPLOYED TO FORM A BSI3N4 MATRIX WITH TUNGSTEN COATED SIC WHISKERS TO THEORETICAL DENSITIES WHILE MAINTAINING A FINE MATRIX GRAIN SIZE, MINIMIZING INTERFACIAL REACTIONS AND OBTAINING OPTIMIZED DEBONDING. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF PHASE I WILL RESULT IN DEMONSTRATION OF A PROCESS FOR FABRICATING RELIABLE CMCS WITH PROPERTIES SUPERIOR TO THE STATE-OF-THE-ART. PHASE II WILL INTEGRATE THE WHISKERS IN 2-D COUPLED WITH FIBER ROUGHENING IN THE 3-D STRUCTURE. PHASE II WILL DEMONSTRATE NEAR-NET SHAPE CAPABILITY AND FABRICATION OF A STRUCTURAL PROTOTYPE. PHASE III WILL SCALE UP THIS PROCESS ESTABLISHING A MANUFACTURING CAPABILITY FOR FORMING RELIABLE, HIGH TOUGHNESS, HIGH STRENGTH, CERAMIC MATRIX COMPOSITES. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PROPOSED APPROACH TO FORM RELIABLE CERAMIC-MATRIX COMPOSITES WILL ENABLE ACCELERATED APPLICATION OF CERAMICS IN HIGH TEMPERATURE APPLICATIONS IN DOD. SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES IN THE USE OF CERAMIC MATERIALS IN THE AIR FORCE, ARMY, AND NAVY WILL BENEFIT. COMMERCIAL SPIN-OFFS ARE LIKELY IN ADVANCED CUTTING TOOLS, TURBOEHOGERS, BEARINGS AND WEAR PARTS.",

CONVENTIONAL QUICK QUENCH SECTIONS FOR CIRCULAR FLAMETUBE CONFIGURATIONS HAVE EMPLOYED RADIAL INFLOW HOLES OR SLOTS, AND LITTLE MIXING OPTIMIZATION HAS BEEN PERFORMED. TWO CONCEPTS ARE PROPOSED FOR IMPROVED MIXING: 1) ASYMMETRIC JET PENETRATION (AJP); AND 2) LOBE MIXER (LM). IN PHASE I, THE AJP CONCEPT WILL BE STUDIED. TWO SCHEMES OF THE AJP CONCEPT WILL BE ANALYZED: 1) COUNTER-VORTEX SCHEME; AND 2) CO-VORTEX SCHEME. THESE SCHEMES PRODUCE MULTIPLE VORTEX PATTERNS WHICH ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE CONVENTIONAL CONCEPT AND HAVE THE POTENTIAL OF ENHANCING OVERALL MIXING. THREE-DIMENSIONAL COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS (CFD) TECHNIQUES WILL BE EMPLOYED TO ANALYZE AND COMPARE THE PROPOSED AJP SCHEMES WITH A CONVENTIONAL RAPID MIX CONCEPT. IN PHASE II, THE SAME CFD METHODS WILL BE EMPLOYED TO SCREENTHE LM CONCEPT. THE MOST PROMISING AJP OR LM CONCEPT WILL BE SELECTED, OPTIMIZED, AND EXPERIMENTALLY TESTED TO SHOW ITS POTENTIAL OF MINIMIZING NOX FORMATION.",

POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS INCLUDE FETAL DISTRESS EVALUATION, ARRHYTHMIA DETECTION, AND ASSESSMENT OF \"POSTDATE\" PREGNANCIES. APEN IS BOTH MATHEMATICALLY AND MEDICALLY INNOVATIVE. IT ENCAPSULATES THE AMOUNT OF PATTERNNESS IN HEARTBEAT DATA INTO A SINGLE NUMBER. ADVANTAGES OVER ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES INCLUDE OBJECTIVITY, READY COMPUTABILITY, BREADTH OF FOCUS, AND POTENTIAL FOR IMMEDIATE APPLICABILITY. A PROTOTYPE STUDY ON NEONATES HAS ALREADY DEMONSTRATED THE EFFICACY OF APEN. PHASE I RESEARCH FOCUSES ON ESTABLISHING PRELIMINARY NORMAL RANGES OF APEN VALUES FOR THE HEALTHY INFANT AND ON SPECIFICALLY TAILORING APEN FOR INFANT HEARTBEAT ANALYSIS.

THESE SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN INTEGRATED WITH TELEOPERATED USER INTERFACE FRONT-ENDS (CONSTRUCTED VIA RAPID PROTOTYPING GRAPHICS INTERFACE PACKAGES SUPPORTED BY SILICON GRAPHICS), AND WITH ACTUAL ROBOTIC TESTBEDS AT THE BACK-END (WHICH ARE MONITOR BY ON-BOARD SENSORS/CAMERAS AND ARE CONTROLLED THROUGH USER INTERACTION WITH THE SIMULATED ENVIRONMENT). THE PRINCIPAL NON-COMMERCIAL (AND SOMEWHAT TASK SPECIFIC) COMPONENT OF THE EXISTING SYSTEM IS THE SPECIFIC OPERATOR INTERFACE MODEL ROBOTIC SYSTEM SIMULATION DATABASE. IN THE PHASE I EFFORT WE WOULD FOCUS ON EARLY EVALUATION OF STATIC AND DYNAMIC DEMONSTRATIONS TO DETERMINE THE OPTIMAL MODEL AND SYSTEMS CONFIGURATIONS FOR A PHASE II FULL SCALE INTEGRATION PROJECT.",

THESE ACTIONS, ESPECIALLY ITS ANTIOXIDANT AND LIPOXYGENASE INHIBITORY ACTIVITIES, SUGGEST THAT CHX 100 MAY REDUCE THE DELETERIOUS EFFECTS OF ACUTE ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT (UVL) EXPOSURE ON THE SKIN, AS THESE EFFECTS MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH FORMATION OF REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS). SUCH EFFECTS INCLUDE ERYTHEMA, EDEMA, AND DAMAGE TO THE EPIDERMAL KERATINOCYTE AND MELANOCYTE. IN ADDITION, THE REPORTED ABILITY OF CHX 100 TO ATTENUATE TUMOR DEVELOPMENT IN A MURINE MODEL OF SKIN TUMOR INITIATIONAND PROMOTION SUGGESTS THE DRUG COULD PREVENT SOME OF THE DELETERIOUS EFFECTS OF CHRONIC SUN EXPOSURE, SUCH AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRECANCEROUS AND CANCEROUS LESIONS. THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY IS TO EVALUATE THE ROLE OF ROS IN UVL-INDUCED DAMAGE TO SKIN CELLS AND THE ABILITY OF CHX 100 AND ROS SCAVENGERS TO PREVENT THIS DAMAGE.

THE METHOD WILL BE SHOWN TO BE INEXPENSIVE DUE TO THERELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF THE HEAVY LIQUID AND THE ABSENCE OF NEED FOR EXPENSIVE THL RECOVERY EQUIPMENT. THE METHOD CARRIES THE BENEFIT OF BEING ENVIRONMENTALLY BENIGN. IN PHASE I OF THE PROGRAM, TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY OF THE METHOD WILL BE DEMONSTRATED IN A SERIES OF BENCH-SCALE TESTS USING HIGH-SULFUR COALS FROM SEVERAL DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS. BTU RECOVERIES IN EXCESS OF 95 PERCENT ARE ATTAINABLE WHILE REDUCING PYRITIC SULFUR BY GREATER THAN 90 WEIGHT PERCENT. THE METHOD DOES NOT RELY ON COMPLETE LIBERATION OF MINERAL MATTER AND THEREFORE DOES NOT REQUIRE THE DEGREE OF GRINDING FOUND IN OTHER ADVANCED BENEFICIATIONPROCESSES SUCH AS FROTH FLOTATION OR SELECTIVE AGGLOMERATION. THE RESIDUAL HEAVY LIQUID MEDIUM ADHERING TOTHE SURFACE OF THE COAL IS POTENTIALLY AN EXCELLENT BINDER FOR BRIQUETTING PURPOSES. THE GOAL OF PHASE II WILL BE CONSTRUCTION OF A MOBILE PILOT PLANT WHICH WILL DEMONSTRATE THE INTEGRATED PROCESS AT VARIOUS COAL WASHING PLANTS.",

THE METHOD COMBINES MULTIPLEX DNA SEQUENCING WITH LIGASE-MEDIATED POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (PCR) AMPLIFICATION OF SPECIFIC RESTRICTION FRAGMENTS. PURIFIED YAC OR COSMID DNA IS DIGESTED WITH TWO DIFFERENT RESTRICTION ENZYMES TO GENERATE FRAGMENTS WITH ONE BLUNT ENDAND ONE AMBIGUOUS 4-BASE 5'-PROTRUDING END. SYNTHETIC OLIGONUCLEOTIDES CONTAINING MULTIPLEX TAG SEQUENCES ARE SPECIFICALLY LIGATED TO THESE ENDS, AND PRIMERS HOMOLOGOUS TO THE TAGS ARE USED TO AMPLIFY THE FRAGMENTS BY PCR. PRODUCTS OF THE PCR REACTIONS ARE POOLED, AND CHEMICAL SEQUENCING REACTIONS ARE PERFORMED. THE SAMPLES ARE FRACTIONATED ON SEQUENCING GELS, ELECTROBLOTTED, AND INDIVIDUAL SEQUENCE LADDERS VISUALIZED ON AUTORADIOGRAMS AFTER SEQUENTIAL HYBRIDIZATION USING MULTIPLEX PROBES. WITH APPROPRIATE SELECTION OF RESTRICTIONENZYMES, THERE IS A HIGH PROBABILITY THAT ANY PARTICULAR 4-BASE END WILL OCCUR ONLY ONCE IN THE STARTING CLONE. EXTENSIVE OVERLAPS CAN BE GENERATED BY USING SEVERAL SETS OFINTERRELATED DOUBLE RESTRICTION DIGESTS. PHASE I STUDIES WILL FOCUS PRIMARILY ON TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE LIGATION AND PCR REACTIONS. A SET OF MULTIPLEX SEQUENCING REACTIONS WILL BE PERFORMED, AND THE APPLICABILITY OF THE METHOD WILL BE EVALUATED.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         GENETIC ENGINEERING TECHNIQUES WILL BE USED TO ENABLE YEAST CELLS TO PRODUCE FUNCTIONAL MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY FRAGMENTS. THE LONG-TERM APPLICATIONS ARE: (1) RELIABLE PRODUCTION OF KILOGRAM QUANTITIES OF MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES (NEEDED IN CANCER THERAPY AND DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING) FROM YEAST FERMENTATIONS RATHER THAN FROM MORE DIFFICULT HYBRIDOMA CULTURES, AND (2) RAPID ENGINEERING AND TESTING OF IMPROVED ANTIBODY-RELATED MOLECULES THROUGH IN VITRO RECOMBINATION AND MUTAGENESIS. FOR EXAMPLE, VECTORS CONTAINING THE HYPERVARIABLE CODING REGIONS FROM RODENT GENES CAN BE RECOMBINED WITH HUMAN CONSTANT OR FRAMEWORK-CODING REGIONS OR OTHER INTERESTING PROTEIN-CODING REGIONS TO PRODUCE NEW MOLECULES. ALSO, THE VARIABLE CODING REGIONS CAN BE RANDOMLY MUTAGENIZED IN VITRO AND RAPIDLY EXPRESSED IN YEAST CELLS. MILLIONS OF YEAST COLONIES, EACH PRODUCING A DIFFERENT SINGLY MUTATED MOLECULE, CAN BE SCREENED FOR IMPROVED ANTIBODY-BINDING SPECIFICITY AND ENZYMATIC ACTIVITY ON PETRI DISHES OR FILTERS. THE KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROJECT IS THE RECENTLY IMPROVED TECHNOLOGY FOR SECRETION OF FOREIGN PROTEINS FROM YEAST. YEAST HOST STRAINS CAPABLE OF SECRETING SINGLE-CHAIN FV MOLECULES HAVE BEEN ENGINEERED. THEY ARE BEING TESTED FOR FAB AND INTACT ANTIBODY PRODUCTION.",

THIS INVOLVES THE VARIABILITY OF SPEECH. WE HAVE PROPOSED THAT THE RECENTLY DEVELOPED DYNAMICAL-NEURAL NETWORK IS A CLASS OF MACHINE INTELLIGENCE WHICH HAS PROPERTIES THAT WARRANTS FURTHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR CONTRIBUTING SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEMS OF SPEECH RECOGNITION. IN PARTICULAR, DYNAMICAL-NEURAL NETWORKS SHOW OPTIMISTIC PROMISE BECAUSE THEY ARE INHERENTLY FAST, THE NATURE OF THEIR FUNCTIONS SUPPORT GENERALIZATION, AND THEY SHOW POTENTIAL FOR STORING LARGE AMOUNTS OF MEMORY ASSOCIATIVELY. THE ONE AREA OF DEVELOPMENT FOR DYNAMICAL-NEURAL NETWORKS, WHICH WOULD MAKE A LARGE IMPROVEMENT IN THE APPLICATION OF SPEECH RECOGNITION, IS THE LEARNING ALGORITHM. IN THIS DOCUMENT WE DESCRIBE A NEW LEARNING ALGORITHM, BASED ON THE NEURAL MECHANISMS OF LEARNING IN THE HUMAN BRAIN, WHICH WE BELIEVE HAS PROMISE FOR CONTROLLING THE TYPE OF ASSOCIATIVE MEMORY REQUIRED TO MEET THE MANY REQUIREMENTS OF A SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM. IT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE PROPOSED WORK TO TEST THIS ALGORITHM, IN PHASE I, THEN MAKE ADAPTIONS AS THE TESTS INDICATE; AND, IN PHASE II, APPLY THE RESULTING IMPROVED NETWORK TO SPEECH RECOGNITION FOR DEFENSE AND COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS. ???????????",

FT., AND A PULSED ENERGY OUTPUT GREATER THAN 25 MJ. THE THE LASER WILL USE A NEW BREAKTHROUGH IN FLASHLAMP TECHNOLOGY WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE POWER NECESSARY TO DEVELOP A UV, POTENTIALLY TUNEABLE, FREQUENCY TRIPLED SOLID-STATE LASER. THIS LASER CONCEPT IS CAPABLE OF STEADY-STATE OPERATION AND CAN ACHIEVE 10-20 NS PULSES WITH NODE LOCKING TECHNIQUES AND WILL OPERATE AT 100 HZ OR BETTER. THE FLASHLAMP WILL USE MICROWAVE PUMPED FLUORESCERS WHICH HAVE PROPERTIES THAT ARE VERY COMPETITIVE WITH SEMICONDUCTOR PUMPING TECHNOLOGIES BUT ALSO HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF OFFERING A BROAD RANGE OF PUMP FREQUENCIES. THESE FLUORESCER SOURCES CAN BE USED TO PUMP SEVERAL TYPES OF SOLID-STATE LASER MATERIALS INCLUDING SOME TUNEABLE MEDIA (E.G., GADOLINIUM SCANDIUM GALLIUM GARNET (GDSCGA-GARNET), TITANIUM-APPHIRE (TI:AL2O3) AND ALEXANDRITE (BEAL2O4)). FOR EXAMPLE, FLASHLAMP DRIVEN TI:AL2O3 HAS DEMONSTRATED W1 EMISSION FROM 720 TO 920 MN AND THERE ARE ONGOING RESEARCH EFFORTS TO FREQUENCY DOUBLE AND TRIPLE TITANIUM-SAPPHIRE (W2 EMISSION FROM 360 TO 460 NM, AND W3 EMISSION FROM 240 TO 306.7 NM).",

PHASE I CONCENTRATES PRIMARILY ON LOSS OF DISPERSANCY; PHASE II WILL CONCENTRATE MORE ON OTHER AREAS SUCH AS OXIDATION, LOSS OF ZDP, AND NITRATION. PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF MEASUREMENTS MADE ON DIESEL ENGINE OIL SAMPLES TAKEN DURING A MILEAGE-ACCUMULATION STUDY HAVE SUPPORTED THE CONCEPT THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO DETECT IMMINENT DISPERSANT FAILURE BY A MEANS OTHER THAN FORMS OF OIL DEGRADATION IS A WELL ESTABLISHED LABORATORY TECHNIQUE.

THE PRIMARY TOOL WILL BE COMPUTER SIMULATION OF HDTV MOTION IMAGES IN NON-REAL TIME USING VAX MINICOMPUTERS. SIMULATION WILL BE PERFORMED TO GAIN INSIGHT INTO WHICH PROPOSED SYSTEMS LEND THEMSELVES BEST TO DIGITAL COMPRESSION, AND TO LEARN WHAT BITRATES ARE REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE GOOD PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED BY MSE AND SUBJECT ANALYSIS OF ARTIFACTS. ALGORITHMIC CHANGES AND INVENTIONS WILL BE MADE IN RESPONSE TO THE INITIAL FINDINGS, WITH ADDITIONAL SIMULATIONS TO FURTHER DEVELOP THE KNOWLEDGE BASE.

THE USE OF STANDARD CFD METHODS TO RESOLVE THE NEAR-WALL BOUNDARY LAYER (WHICH IS ESSENTIAL FOR GOOD PRECITIONS OF AIRFOIL BEHAVIOR) USING A LARGE NUMBER OF GRID POINTS IS SELDOM FEASIBLE, OFTEN INACCURATE, AND IF DONE, ALWAYS REQUIRES EXCESSIVE COMPUTATIONAL POWER AND EXPENSE. CONSEQUENTLY, THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS SBIR PROJECT IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF INNOVATIVE COMPUTATIONAL PROCEDURES WHICH DO NOT SUFFER FROM THE PROBLEMS OF CONVENTIONAL FINITE DIFFERENCE CODES AND YET STILL PROVIDE HIGHLY ACCURATE PREDICTION OF SKIN FRICTION AND HEATING RATES FOR HYPERSONIC FLOWS. THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED USING HIGHER-ORDER POLYNOMIALS TO MODEL THE BOUNDARY-LAYER IN CONJUNCTION IWHT LOCAL GRID REFINEMENT. AUTOMATIC ADAPTIVE STRATEGIES THAT WILL EITHER REFINE THE GRID LOCALLY (H-ADAPTATION) OR ENRICH THE POLYNOMIAL BASIS (P-ADAPTATION) WILL BE EMPLOYED. THESE NOVEL ADAPTIVE STRATEGIES WILL BE APPLIED FOR THE FIRST TIME TO HYPERSONIC FLOWS ABOUT ARBITARILY-SHAPED VEHICLES USING A NEW PARABOLIC NAVIER-STOKE ALGORITH. THE FINAL PRODUCT WILL BE A UNIQUE AND POWERFUL SOFTWARE PACKAGE FOR MODELING THREE-DIMENSIONAL HYPERSONIC FLOWS. ???????????",

RECENTLY THERE HAS BEEN INCREASED INTERESTED IN UTILIZING BLIND EQUALIZATION METHODS FOR THIS PURPOSE -THAT IS, METHODS THAT DO NOT REQUIRE THE TRANSMISSION OF SPECIALIZED \"TRAINING\" SEQUENCES IN ORDER TO PERFORM THE EQUALIZATION FUNCTION. THE ADVENT OF ACOUSTIC CHARGE TRANSPORT DEVICES PROMISES TO PERMIT COST EFFECTIVE AND HIGH PERFORMING ADAPTIVE EQUALIZATION, AS COMPARED TO THE CURRENT EXPENSIVE ALL DIGITAL APPROACHES. THIS PROPOSED STUDY ADDRESSES THE APPLICATION OF ACOUSTIC CHARGE TRANSPORT TECHNOLOGY TO BLIND EQUALIZATION OF COMPLEX DIGITALLY MODULATED SIGNALS. IT IS DIRECTED TOWARD MILITARY AND OTHER U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES REQUIREMENTS FOR RECONNAISSANCE/ECM AS WELL AS TOWARD GOVERNMENT COMMUNICATIONS APPLICATIONS. ANICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - THE RESULTING STUDY WILL DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ACT TECHNOLOGY IN SOLVING THE PCM BLIND EQUALIZATION PROBLEM AND DEVELOPMENT ARCHITECTURES SUITABLE FOR EQUALIZER/DEMODULATOR DEVELOPMENT. PRINCIPLE EMPHASIS WILL BE TOWARD REDUCING THE COST OF SUCH EQUALIZATION VERSUS CURRENT ALL DIGITAL APPROACHES. KEY WORDS - EQUALIZATION, ACOUSTIC CHARGE TRANSPORT, ACT, PCM, ADAPTIVE FILTERING",

THIS PROJECT THUS ADDRESSES THE MAJOR UNSOLVED TECHNICAL ISSUE IMPACTING BNCT CLINICAL EFFICACY. BNCT IS APROMISING RADIATION THERAPY IN WHICH NEUTRONS ARE USED TO ACTIVATE BORON THAT HAS BEEN PRE-POSITIONED WITHIN THE CELL BY BIOCHEMICAL TECHNIQUES. WHEN A BORON ATOM CAPTURES A THERMAL NEUTRON, THE SUBSEQUENT REACTION PRODUCES AN ENERGETIC ALPHA PARTICLE AND LI ION WITH RANGES APPROXIMATELY ONE CELL DIAMETER. THE SHORT RANGES OF THE REACTION PRODUCTS LIMIT DAMAGE TO SURROUNDING TISSUE, BUT REQUIRES THAT THE BORON BE PROPERLY POSITIONED, IN THERAPEUTIC QUANTITIES, WITHIN THE CELL WALL. ADEQUATE MEANS OF DETECTING INTRACELLULAR BORON DO NOT CURRENTLY EXIST. IN THIS PROJECT WE PROPOSE TO DESIGN AND CONSTRUCT A NEW, HIGHLY EFFICIENT TRANSMISSION GRATING SPECTROMETER (TGS) THAT CAN BE ATTACHED TO A SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE(SEM) AND USED TO DETECT THE BORON-K SOFT X-RAY RADIATION EXCITED BY THE SEM BEAM.

PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE ONLY DETECTABLE THROMBIN SUBSTRATE ON THE PLATELET MEMBRANE SURFACE IS GP V. IN THIS STUDY, GP V WILL BE CLONED TO DEDUCE THE AMINO ACID SEQUENCE OF THIS PROTEIN. VARIOUS EXPRESSION SYSTEMS WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER GP V IS THE THROMBIN RECEPTOR. PHASE II RESEARCH WILL DEVELOP AN INHIBITOR OF GP V HYDROLYSIS. SUCH AN INHIBITOR WILL FORM A NEW CLASS OF THERAPEUTIC AGENTS THAT RESTRICT THE FORMATION OF ARTERIAL THROMBOSIS BY INHIBITING THE PLATELET ACTIVATION PROCESS. THIS NEW CLASS OF DRUGS WILL BE MARKETED COMMERCIALLY AS AGENTS THAT WILL LIMIT THROMBUS FORMATION IN A VARIETY OF CLINICAL SITUATIONS, INCLUDING UNSTABLE ANGINA, THROMBOTIC STROKE, PATIENTS UNDERGOING ANGIOPLASTY AND FIBRINOLYSIS, AND PATIENTS AT RISK FOR CORONARY OCCLUSIONS.",

IT IS LIKELY THAT THESE MATERIALS WILL INCLUDE CERAMICS AND CERMETS REINFORCED WITH DIAMOND FIBERS. THESE NEW COMPOSITES ARE EXPECTED TO EXHIBIT AN UNPRECEDENTED RANGE OF PHYSICAL PROPERTIES, INCLUDING SUPERIOR THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY, EXCELLENT RESISTANCE TO THERMAL ____ EXTREME HARDNESS, CONTROLLABLE ELECTRICAL RESISTIVITY, AND OTHER PROPERTIES UNIQUE TO DIAMOND. MANUFACTURE OF THESE CERAMICS EMPLOYS PLASMA-ENHANCED CHEMICAL VAPOR DIAMOND DEPOSITION TECHNOLOGY RECENTLY DEVELOPED WITH GREAT SUCCESS FOR SYNTHESIS OF DIAMOND THIN FILMS. THE PROPOSED PHASE I WORK WILL DEFINE PROCESSES FOR MAKING DIAMOND COMPOSITE CERAMICS, PREPARE DIAMOND COMPOSITE CERAMICS BOTH WITH AND WITHOUT REINFORCING WHISKERS, AND WILL CHARACTERIZE THESE MATERIALS FOR COMPOSITION, MICROSTRUCTURE, AND FRACTURE STRENGTH. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - THE FIELDS OF APPLICATIONS FOR DIAMOND COMPOSITE CERAMICS ARE EXTREMELY VARIED. IN THE FEDERAL AREAS OF INTEREST, CRYSTALLUME EXPECTED THESE MATERIALS TO FIND USE IN ADVANCED ARMOR AND KINETIC PENETRATORS, PRECISION GUIDANCE STRUCTURES, AND AIRFRAME AND MISSILE STRUCTURES WITH STEALTH CHARACTERISTICS. A MAJOR ELECTRONIC USE WILL ARISE IN PACKAGING OF THERMALLY-LIMITED ELECTRONIC DEVICES SUCH AS MULTICHIP MODULES (MCMS). WITH DECLINING PRODUCTION COSTS, LARGE-VOLUME APPLICATIONS SUCH AS GUN BARREL LINERS SHOULD COME WITHIN PRACTICAL REACH OF THE TECHNOLOGY. COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF THESE MATERIALS WILL FIRST INCLUDE ELECTRONIC PACKAGING AND SLIDING WEAR SURFACE APPLICATIONS SUCH AS PRECISION MACHINE TOOL BEDS AND WAYS. INTERMEDIATE APPLICATIONS INCLUDE NEW TYPES OF CUTTING TOOLS, WITH LONGER-TERM USES INCLUDING TURBINE BLADES FOR HIGH-TEMPERATURE, ENHANCED FUEL EFFICIENCY TURBINES.",

EACH OF THESE AREAS REQUIRES DESIGN CRITERIA TO INSURE PERFORMANCE AND SAFETY. THE CRITERIA MAY BE IMPLEMENTED BY FORMULAS, DESIGN CHARTS, COMPUTER PROGRAMS, ETC. THE CHALLENGE IS TO ADAPT THESE CRITERIA IN A MANNER THAT MAKES THEM SUITABLE FOR AN OPTIMIZATION CODE. THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS TO DEAL WITH THESE CRITERIA, DEPENDING ON THEIR NATURE: THEY COULD BE FULLY INTEGRATED WITH THE STRUCTURAL OPTIMIZATION OR TREATED IN A SUBSIDIARY OPERATION. PHASE I IS INTENDED TO EXPLORE DESIGN CRITERIA FOR VARIOUS DISCIPLINES AND TO PROPOSE METHODS FOR ADAPTING THEM FOR OPTIMIZATION. PHASE II WILL ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT UP TO THREE OF THESE CRITERIA. ???????????",

        "abstract": "Abstract         VIBRATIONS ARE AN INHERENT PROBLEM FOR AIRCRAFT STRUCTURES, ESPECIALLY MILITARY AIRCRAFT THAT PERFORM HIGH-SPEED MANEUVERS CAUSING EXTREME ACCELERATION LEVELS. A FORM OF UNWANTED VIBRATION REFERRED TO AS BUFFET OFTEN OCCURS WHEN A SURFACE OF AN AIRCRAFT IS DIRECTLY EXPOSED TO AN UNSTEADY, VORTEX FLOW GENERATED UPSTREAM DURING HIGH-ANGLE-OF-ATTACK MANEUVERS. IN THE CASE OF CERTAIN FIGHTER AIRCRAFT, FOR EXAMPLE, BUFFETING OF THE TWIN VERTICAL STABILIZERS EXCITES THE BENDING AND TORSIONAL MODES OF THESE STRUCTURES, AND, OVER TIME, FATIGUE FAILURES OCCUR. AIRCRAFT DESIGN IS CONTROLLED BY MANY FACTORS, AND USUALLY VIBRATION PROBLEMS HAVE TO BE SOLVED WITHOUT MAJOR DESIGN MODIFICATIONS; VIBRATION DAMPING IS OFTEN A PREFERRED SOLUTION ESPECIALLY WHEN THE SOURCE OF THE EXCITATION CANNOT BE ELIMINATED. DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF DAMPING TREATMENTS INDICATE THAT TUNED-MASS DAMPERS ARE MORE FEASIBLE FOR AIRCRAFT AERODYNAMIC SURFACE VIBRATION PROBLEMS THAN OTHER TYPES OF DAMPERS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR MODIFICATIONS TO EXISTING AIRCRAFT. DAMPING TECHNOLOGY HAS ADVANCED DRAMATICALLY IN RECENT YEARS, AND THE APPLICATION OF PASSIVE DAMPING TECHNOLOGY HAS PRODUCED IMPRESSIVE RESULTS FOR A WIDE RANGE OF STRUCTURES. INCORPORATING DAMPING INTO AIRFOIL STRUCTURES IS A NATURAL PROGRESSION THAT COULD SOLVE CURRENT PROBLEMS AND LEAD TO IMPROVED DESIGNS IN THE FUTURE.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS (ANN) HAVE PROVEN CAPABILITY IN FORWARD ERROR CORRECTION (FEC) ENCODING AND DECODING. THIS PROPOSAL STRIVES TO ADDRESS THE POTENTIAL THAT ANNS MAY ENABLE NON-COOPERATING RECEIVERS TO IDENTIFY, CONFIGURE, AND RECOVER INFORMATION FROM A COMPLEX COMMUNICATION CHANNEL. MODERN DIGITAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO TRANSMIT DATA AT EXTREMELY HIGH RATES - SOMETIMES IN EXCESS OF 100MBITS/SECOND. TO PROTECT THE INFORMATION IS THESE SYSTEMS FROM ERRORS, FORWARD ERROR CODING (FEC) HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED AS A CRITICAL COMPONENT IN THESE SYSTEMS. FORWARD ERROR CORRECTION IS A LOW LATENCY METHOD OF RECOVERING THE DATA THROUGH A COMPUTATIONAL PROCESS THAT RELIES ON REDUNDANCY IN THE TRANSMITTED DATA. THE ABILITY TO RAPIDLY IDENTIFY AND DECODE COMMUNICATION CHANNELS CONTAINING CONTAINING FECS IS OF GREAT INTEREST TO ELEMENTS WITHIN DOD. RESEARCHERS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANNS CAPABLE OF PERFORMING THE CODING AND DECODING THE FEC IN COOPERATING SYSTEMS. THIS HAS STIMULATED THE CONCEPT DEVELOPED IN THIS PROPOSAL. THE CURRENT ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE TO IDENTIFY A CHANNEL AS HAVING FEC IS A BRUTE FORCE, MAN AND MACHINE INTENSIVE TASK, USING ALGEBRAIC TECHNIQUES, AND FREQUENCY ANALYSIS. IT IS THE INTENT OF THIS EFFORT TO INVESTIGATE THE POSSIBILITY THAT ANNS WILL BE ABLE TO IMPROVE THE RESULTS OF PROCESSING AN UNKNOWN FEC. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - THE BENEFITS OF THE APPLICATION OF ANNS TO FECS ARE TO BE GAINED IN THE IMPROVED EFFICIENCY IN ANALYZING NEW AND COMPLEX COMMUNICATION CHANNELS. AN ADDITIONAL BENEFIT COULD BE GAINED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ADAPTIVE ERROR CORRECTING RECEIVERS, DEVICES CAPABLE OF IDENTIFYING AND TRACKING THE ERROR CODE SELECTION OF A TRANSMITTER, WHERE THE TRANSMITTER SELECTS THE MODE OF ERROR CORRECTION IN RESPONSE.",

IN FACT, AT DEPTHS BELOW THE ROOT ZONE THERE IS NO FIELD METHOD AVAILABLE TO DETERMINE WHAT IS OFTEN THE SINGLEMOST IMPORTANT SOIL PROPERTY, UNSATURATED HYDRAULIC ] CONDUCTIVITY. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS DIRECTED TOWARD DEVELOPING A PRACTICAL FIELD TOOL TO DETERMINE UNSATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY IN SITU IN DISCRETE INTERVALS OVER ANY DEPTH. IN PHASE I OUR FIRST TASK IS TO COMPILE EXISTINGANALYTICAL SOLUTIONS THAT MAY BE RELEVANT TO DEVELOPING OUR UNSATURATED SOIL PERMEAMETER. THE SECOND TASK WILL BE TO EVALUATE THE SUITABILITY OF THE EXISTING SOLUTIONS USING MATHEMATICAL ANALYSES, AS WELL AS NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS. WEWILL ALSO EXPLORE THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING NEW ANALYTICAL AND NUMERICALLY-BASED REGRESSION SOLUTIONS. THE THIRD TASK IS TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING FIELD EQUIPMENT NECESSARY TO SATISFY THE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS AND DATA REQUIREMENTS SPECIFIED BY THE MATHEMATICAL MODEL. IN PHASE II WE WOULD PROPOSE TO CONSTRUCT AND TEST THE FIELD EQUIPMENT, AND IN PHASE III THE APPARATUS WOULD BE COMMERCIALLY DEVELOPED AND MARKETED. THE APPLICATION OF OUR NEW METHODOLOGY WOULD PROVIDE A TIMELY RESPONSE TO A VERY SIGNIFICANT DATA REQUIREMENT FACED NOT ONLY BY MANY SOIL SCIENTISTS, BUT ALSO GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERS AND HYDROLOGISTS CONCERNED ABOUT SEEPAGE FROM IMPOUNDMENTS AND LAND FILLS, HAZARDOUS WASTE MOVEMENT IN SOIL, REMEDIAL ACTION PROGRAMS, AND HIGH LEVEL RADIOACTIVE WASTE STORAGE IN THE UNSATURATED ZONE.

POLYNOMIAL MODELS ARE USED BECAUSE THEY: ARE EASY TO CONSTRUCT, ARE COMPUTATIONALLY EFFICIENT, AND DO NOT REQUIRE DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF THE TARGET'S DYNAMICS. THE PRICE OF THIS SIMPLICITY IS THAT THEY RELY ON THE DATA TO CONTINUALLY CORRECT THE STATE ESTIMATE FOR UNMODELED EFFECTS. SINCE POLYNOMIAL FILTERS IGNORE SIGNIFICANT (AND KNOWN) DYNAMICS, THEY MUST BE MADE MORE RESPONSIVE TO CURRENT DATA (I.E. USE LARGER FILTER GAINS) THAN FILTERS BASED ON MORE ACCURATE MODELS.

DESIGNS WILL BE INTRODUCED IN WHICH ECHO CANCELLATION, EQUALIZATION, AUTOMATIC GAIN CONTROL, AND TIMING AND CARRIER RECOVERY ARE ALL PERFORMED DIGITALLY ON SINGLE OR MULTIPLE DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSORS. BOTH FIXED POINT AND FLOATING POINT IMPLEMENTATIONS WILL BE DEVELOPED AND THE FINITE PRECISION ISSUES INVOLVED IN MAPPING THESE ALGORITHMS TO FINITE WORDLENGTH DSP'S WILL BE ADDRESSED. REAL TIME AND HIGH LEVEL SIMULATIONS OF THESE ALGORITHMS WILL BE PERFORMED OVER REALISTIC CHANNELS. THESE INCLUDE FADING IN MOBILE DIGITAL RADIO AND VOICE-BAND CHANNELS WITH VARIOUS IMPAIRMENTS. PRESENT DIGITAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS BASED ON CURRENT ADAPTIVE FILTERING TECHNOLOGY FAIL IN WORST CASE CHANNELS FOR VOICE-BAND MODEMS AND IN THE CASE OFMOBILE COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, DURING RAPID FADING. HIGHER SPEED COMMUNICATION OVER CHANNELS WITH MORE NOISE ANDDISTORTION WILL BECOME FEASIBLE BY EMPLOYING THESE NEW ALGORITHMS. FURTHERMORE, THE ALL DIGITAL DSP-BASED DESIGN ENSURES MANUFACTURABILITY WITH GREATER RELIABILITY AND LITTLE OR NO TIME CONSUMING MANUAL ADJUSTMENTS.",

THE PRODUCTION OF HIGH QUALITY, SYNTHETIC DIAMONDS OFFERS THE POTENTIAL FOR GROWING SELECT CRYSTALS TO CREATE TAILORED LASER SUBSTRATES. SEVERAL PROPOSED DOPED DIAMOND SYSTEMS COULD RESULT IN NEW SOLID STATE LASERS WITH TUNABLE OUTPUT FREQUENCIES IN THE VISIBLE. WE PROPOSE A PROOF-OF-PRINCIPLE EXPERIMENT TO TEST THIS CAPABILITY. THE EXPERIMENTS PROPOSED IN THIS PHASE I STUDY WILL TEST THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS APPROACH BY PRODUCING AND CHARACTERIZING SELECTIVELY DOPED CRYSTALS THROUGH PHYSICAL MODIFICATION OF NATURAL DIAMONDS. THE FINAL EVALUATION WILL BE BASED UPON THE EXTENT OF DOPING WHICH CAN BE ACHIEVED, AS WELL AS A SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF THE DOPED CRYSTALS.

        "abstract": "Abstract         LASER BASED NON-INTRUSIVE REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUES ARE BEING DEVELOPED TO CHARACTERIZE SUPERSONIC FLOWS AND THRUSTS IN HIGH PERFORMANCE JET ENGINE EXHAUSTS. THE MOST PROMISING APPROACH TO MAKING A VELOCITY MEASUREMENT INVOLVES THE PRECISE MEASUREMENT OF A DOPPLER SHIFTED MOLECULAR ABSORPTION OR FLUORESCENCE SIGNAL AND RELATING THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SHIFT TO THE CARRIER FLOW VELOCITY. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLE TO THIS APPROACH IS IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE SMALL SPECTRAL SHIFT TO AN ACCURACY SUFFICIENT TO BE USEFUL. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A RESONANCE FLUORESCENCE - DOPPLER SHIFT APPROACH WHICH CAN PROVIDE TWO DIMENSIONAL VELOCITY AND DENSITY DATA WITH KHZ DATA RATES. IN OUR APPROACH THE FREQUENCY PRECISIION IS PROVIDED BY A NARROWBAND CONTINUOUS DYE LASER WHICH IS FREQUENCY MODULATED OVER A SMALL RANGE (NEAR A MOLECULAR ABSORPTION). THE FREQUENCY MODULATION TECHNIQUE TO BE USED HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AND DEMONSTRATED AT KHZ CYCLE RATES. THE LASER BEAM IS PASSED THROUGH A REFERENCE CELL CONTAINING THE MOLECULAR SPECIES TO BE PROBED AND IS THEN PASSED THROUGH THE EXHAUST FLOW TO BE DETERMINED. SINCE THE DOPPLER SHIFTED MOLECULES IN THE HIGH SPEED FLOW WILL BE EXCITED AND FLUORESCENCE AT A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FREQUENCY FROM THOSE IN THE REFERENCE CELL, THE TWO FLUORESCENCE SIGNALS WILL OCCUR AT DIFFERENT TIMES IN THE LASER MODULATION CYCLE. BY MEASURING THE TIME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE SIGNALS THE DOPPLER SHIFT CAN BE DETERMINED WITH GREAT PRECISION. THE MAGNITUDE OF THE RAYLEIGH SCATTER FROM THE OBSERVATION POINT, WHICH IS CONSTANT WITH LASER FREQUENCY, CAN BE MONITORED AND USED TO DETERMINE THE GAS DENSITY AS WELL. THE ABSOLUTE INTENSITY OF THE FLUORESCENCE SIGNAL (OR THE RELATIVE SIGNALS OF TWO TRANSITIONS) MAY ALSO PROVE USEFUL FOR THE SIMULTANEOUS DETERMINATION OF OTHER FLOW FIELD PROPERTIES SUCH AS SPECIES CONCENTRATION AND TEMPERATURE.",

THESE ENGINES HAVE ALUMINUM HOUSING (BODIES) BUT OTHER PARTS OF THE ENGINE ARE STEEL MADE OR OTHER FERROUS METALS. DGI PROPOSES A PROGRAM TO REDUCE THE MAGNETIC SIGNATURE OF A 150 HP ENGINE. THIS WILL BE DONE THROUGH IDENTIFICATION OF THE PARTS OF THE ENGINE WITH MAGNETIC SIGNATURES, AND THE SUBSEQUENT CHOICE OF ALTERNATIVE MATERIALS FOR THESE PARTS. THE ALTERNATIVE MATERIALS AVAILABLE ARE ALUMINUM, HEAT RESISTANT METALS, CERAMICS AND STATE-OF-THE-ART PLASTICS. THE CHOICE FOR EACH OF THE PARTS TO BE REPLACED IS NOT OBVIOUS BECAUSE MANY CONSIDERATIONS ENTER INTO THE DECISION. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE THE ABILITY OF THE COMPONENT TO ENDURE HEAT AND WEAR; THE ABILITY WITH WHICH THE MATERIAL CAN BE WORKED TO PRODUCE THE PART; THE ABILITY OF THE MATERIAL TO WITHSTAND VIBRATION, SHOCK AND OTHER MECHANICAL STRESSES; AND THE FUTURE COST OF THE COMPONENT. THE PHASE I OF THE SBIR, DGI PROPOSES THE EVALUATION OF THE CHANGES NEEDED AND WILL PRODUCE A PLAN FOR PRODUCTION OF A PROTOTYPE ENGINE. THIS ENGINE WILL BE TESTED WITH RESPECT TO TWO SETS OF CRITERIA. THE FIRST WILL BE THE REDUCTION IN MAGNETIC SIGNATURES BETWEEN THIS ENGINE AND A NORMAL ROTARY ENGINE. THE SECOND SET OF CRITERIA WILL BE TO TEST THE ENGINE FOR PERFORMANCE AND DURABILITY, AND TO DETERMINE IF THIS IS IN ANY WAY CHANGED BY THE INCLUSION OF A NON-MAGNETIC COMPONENT. ??????",

THEREFORE, THE LONG-TERM VIABILITY OF HML BASING CAN BE ENHANCED. LF/MF CAN BE IMPLEMENTED AS AN OVERLAY TO THE CURRENT WCS BASELINE. IT ALSO OFFERS BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY WITH BOTH SLFCS AND GWEN. ALTHOUGH THE PRESENT DISCUSSION FOCUSES ON HML BASING, LF/MF GROUNDWAVE MAY ALSO BE APPLICABLE TO OTHER MOBILE ICBM BASING MODES--INCLUDING RGB, AND OTHER BASING CONCEPTS OF THE FUTURE.

THE THREE CHANNELS ARE TRANSLATED BY A CONSTANT FREQUENCY SHIFT, AND SUMMED TOGETHER. THE COMPOSITE SIGNAL IS AMPLIFIED BY A LINEAR AMPLIFIER TO 5 WATTS PER CHANNEL AND RETRANSMITTED. A DIPLEXER SEPARATES THE RECEIVE AND TRANSMIT BANDS TO ALLOW A COMMON ANTENNA. THE REPEATER WILL OPERATE FOR 12 HOURS WITH 50% DUTY CYCLE.

THESE NONLINEAR SYSTEMS CAN EXHIBIT THE ABILITY TO REPRESENTNONLINEAR MAPPING NETWORKS, TO MANAGE MULTIVARIATE DATA, TO MANAGE TEMPORAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND TO FUNCTION WITHOUT THE PRIOR SELECTION OF A BASIS FUNCTION. THIS PHASE I PROGRAM WILL IDENTIFY AND CHARACTERIZE POTENTIAL HYBRID NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURES WHICH PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT PERFORMANCE ADVANTAGES OVER PRESENTLY USED TECHNIQUES IN FORECASTING LARGE SCALE NONLINEAR SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION, THIS PROGRAM WILL COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF CURRENTLY USED TIME SERIES TECHNIQUES WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF SPECIALIZED NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURES. THIS PROJECT HAS STRONG COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS. NONLINEAR FORECASTING SYSTEMS ARE PARTICULARLY WELL SUITED FOR ELECTRIC POWER FORECASTING, ECONOMETRIC MODELLING, AND TRANSPORTATION FORECASTING. WITH THE ADDITION OF A POWERFULUSER INTERFACE TO THE OPTIMIZED NONLINEAR SYSTEMS OF PHASE II, THE FINAL SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO BE VERY USEFUL TO THE ABOVE MENTIONED INDUSTRIES. THEREFORE, FOLLOW-ON FUNDING ISFULLY EXPECTED.",

FURTHER, THE INCREASED EMPHASIS ONREGENERATIVE SURGERY HAS STRAINED THE ABILITY OF THE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE ARMENTARIUM TO EFFECTIVELY REMOVE GRANULATION TISSUE. A SECONDARY OBJECTIVE IS TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE AEROSOL CONTAMINATION ASSOCIATED WITH CURRENTLY USED METHODS OF GRANULATION TISSUE REMOVAL. THE SURGICAL DEVICE WILL CONSIST OF A MODIFIED BUR RUNNING IN A SUCTION TUBE. THE TUBE IS INSERTED INTO SURGICALLY ENCOUNTERED DEFECTS WHERE THE SUCTION WILL PULL THE GRANULATION TISSUE INTO THE TUBE AND THE BUR WILL GRAB AND CUT IT. THE SUCTION WILL ALSO ELIMINATE THE WATER SPRAY ANDPARTICULATE CONTAMINATION ASSOCIATED WITH ULTRASONICS CURRENTLY USED FOR TISSUE REMOVAL. THE PHASE I PROGRAM WILL CONCENTRATE ON THE FABRICATION AND IN VITRO TESTING OF THE MECHANICAL GRANULATION TISSUE REMOVER FOR ITS ABILITY TO REMOVE TISSUE EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY. THE PHASE II PROGRAM WILL BE ORIENTED TOWARD THE EVALUATION OF THIS SURGICAL INSTRUMENT IN HUMAN CLINICALSITUATIONS.",

MANY AMERICANS AVOID TIMELY DENTAL CARE OUT OF FEAR OF THE MECHANICAL DRILLS AND THE DENTAL ANESTHETIC NEEDLES. A NONMECHANICAL, NONCONTRACTING LASER DRILL WITHOUT THE GRINDING, WHIRRING NOISE WOULD BE A BOON TO THESE PATIENTS. HOWEVER, UNTIL RECENTLY, LASER DRILLING OF INTACT TOOTH TISSUE, USING THE CARBON DIOXIDE LASER AND THE ND:YAG LASER,ONLY RESULTED IN CHARRING AND CRACKING OF ENAMEL. IN SHARP CONTRAST, THE 2.94-MICRON ER:YAG LASER HAS BEEN SHOWN TO DRILL FINE, SHARP HOLES IN ENAMEL AND DENTIN, WITH NO ULTRASTRUCTURAL DAMAGE AND NO THERMAL ELEVATIONS EXCEEDING THE PHYSIOLOGIC LIMITS OF DENTAL PULP. AS THE DURATION OF THE ERBIUM LASER PULSES USED IS IN THE MICROSECOND RANGE, WELL BELOW THE PAIN THRESHOLD OF THE BRAIN, LASER DRILLING OF TEETH MAY BE ALMOST PAINLESS. IN PHASE I, IN VITRO TOOTH EXPOSURES USING PULSED ER:YAG LASERS AT VARYING POWER LEVELS, EXPOSURE TIMES, AND SPOT SIZES WILL BE MADE TO DETERMINE THE RESULTANT TEMPERATURE CHANGES AND DEPTHS OF CUTS. SEM EXAMINATION, X-RAY DIFFRACTION ANALYSIS, AND FTIR SPECTROSCOPY WILL BE DONE OF THE LASED AREA. TOOTH DRILLING BY THE FIBER-TRANSMITTED ERBIUM LASER WILL BE STUDIED.

THE PROPOSED SYSTEM WILL BE DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE DELIVERY OF MOLYBDENUM DISULFIDE TO THE BEARINGS OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL ADVANCED AIRCRAFT GAS TURBINE, WHICH MAY OPERATE BETWEEN THE EXTREMES OF -60 DEG F AND 1500 DEG F. THE AVAILABLE LIQUID LUBRICANTS ARE NOT STABLE AT THE HIGH END OF THIS RANGE AND THE USE OF SOLID LUBRICANTS IS THE PREFERRED OPTION FOR LUBRICATION OF THE ADVANCED GAS TURBINE. THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THE MAIN OBSTACLE TO TRANSPORT OF POWDER, WHICH IS THE TENDENCY OF POWDERS TO AGGLOMERATE AND CLING TO SURFACES BECAUSE OF ELECTRO-STATIC FORCES. IF GASEOUS DISPERSIONS OF LUBRICANTS ARE STABILIZED, IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO MOVE THEM IN SIMPLE WAYS IN ORDER TO DELIVER THEM TO BEARINGS. OPERATION AT HIGHER TEMPERATURES WILL IMPROVE THE THERMODYNAMIC EFFICIENCIES OF ENGINES, PROVIDING HIGHER POWER-TO-WEIGHT RATIOS, IMPROVING FUEL EFFICIENCIES, AND, THEREBY, ENHANCING MISSION CAPABILITIES.

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF INFANT AND TODDLER MOTOR DEVELOPMENT. SPECIFIC AIMS INCLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF NEW STRATEGIES FOR ANALYZING MOTOR BEHAVIOR WITH EMPHASIS ON QUALITY OF MOVEMENT. QUALITY OF MOVEMENT WILL BE OPERATIONALIZED AS: (1) VARIATIONS WITHIN A POSITION, (2) TRANSITIONS WITHIN A POSITION, (3) COMPLEX COMBINATIONS OF SINGLE MOTOR EVENTS, AND (4) THE NUMBER OF ABNORMAL MOVEMENT PATTERNS. THE SAMPLE WILL BE 390 NORMAL AND 90 HIGH-RISK CHILDREN. ANALYSES WILL FOCUS ON DETERMINING NORMATIVE MOTOR PATTERNS,DEVELOPMENTAL AGE TRENDS, HIGH-RISK/NORMAL GROUP DIFFERENCES, AND RELIABILITY. THE PROPOSED OBSERVATION SYSTEM EVALUATES MOVEMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF SPONTANEOUS, NATURALLY OCCURRING PLAY. MOTOR ASSESSMENTS THAT INVOLVE DIRECT HANDLING OF THE CHILD HAVE CONSISTENTLY BEEN FOUND TO BE UNRELIABLE. THE NEW APPROACH MINIMIZES THE UNCONTROLLED-FOR EFFECTS OF EXAMINER-EXAMINEE INTERACTIONS BECAUSE LITTLE HANDLING IS REQUIRED. THE RESPONSIBLE IMPLEMENTATION OF PUBLIC LAW 99-457 DEMANDS RELIABLE AND VALID OBSERVATIONAL TECHNIQUES FOR USE WITH INFANTS AND TODDLERS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS THEORETICALLY AND CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL AND LIKELY TO BE OF VALUE IN EVALUATING MOTOR DEVELOPMENT AND PREDICTING RISK.",

THE DIAMOND ELECTRONIC DEVICE MOST LIKELY TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED T/R SWITCH SPECIFICATIONS IS AN INSULATED GATE FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTOR (IGFET) OPERATED AS A SWITCHING POWER TRANSISTOR. DIAMOND MATERIALS, INC. (DMI), PLANS TO DEVELOP A DIAMOND IGFET T/R SWITCH IN TWO PHASES. IN PHASE I, DMI WILL EVALUATE CUBIC BORON NITRIDE (C-BN) THIN FILMS AS A SUITABLE GATE DIELECTRIC FOR DIAMOND IGFETS. THE PROPERTIES OF THE GATE DIELECTRIC ARE CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THE DIAMOND IGFET, AND DMI BELIEVES THAT C-BN SHOULD BE THE BEST GATE DIELECTRIC MATERIAL. DMI WILL DEPOSIT C-BN FILMS ON P-TYPE, EPITAXIAL DIAMOND MONOCRYSTALS, AND WILL EVALUATE THE ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES OF THE C-BN/DIAMOND INTERFACE. THE C-BN FILMS WILL BE DEPOSITED USING A PROPRIETARY PROCESS UNDER DEVELOPMENT AT DMI. IF THE ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES OF C-BN ON DIAMOND ARE ACCEPTABLE, THEN DMI WILL PROPOSE A PHASE II PROGRAM TO DEVELOP DIAMOND IGFETS (WITH C-BN GATE DIELECTRICS) AS T/R SWITCHES. PHASE II WILL STRIVE TO DEVELOP DIAMOND T/R SWITCHES WHICH MEET THE POWER, FREQUENCY, VOLTAGE, AND SWITCHING TIME SPECIFICATIONS DESIRED BY THE AIR FORCE. THE P-CHANNEL IGFET HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS THE MOST PRACTICAL TRANSISTOR ARCHITECTURE FOR DIAMOND BECAUSE ITS PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS SHOULD BE REASONABLY CONSTANT OVER A WIDE TEMPERATURE RANGE, AND BECAUSE IT SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO TRANSMIT HIGH FREQUENCY SIGNALS.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         ONE FACTOR LIMITING THE USE OF OPTICS IN APPLICATIONS SUCH AS COMMUNICATIONS, LASER RADAR, AND OPTICAL PROCESSING IS THE LACK OF A SATISFACTORY TECHNOLOGY FOR THE STEERING AND SHAPING OF OPTICAL BEAMS. SIMILAR PROBLEMS HAVE EXISTED FOR RADAR AND RADIO COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS. IN THOSE TECHNOLOGIES, HOWEVER, THE PROBLEMS HAVE LARGELY BEEN SOLVED BY THE USE OF PHASED ARRAY ANTENNA TECHNIQUES. DISPLAYTECH HAS DEMONSTRATED A HIGH SPEED ELECTRICALLY ADDRESSED SPATIAL LIGHT MODULATOR (SLM) CONTAINING BOTH A 64X64 ARRAY AND A 1X128 ARRAY WHICH MAY SERVE AS A PROTOTYPE OPLICAL PHASED ARRAY (OPA). THE SLM WAS BUILT BY JOINING FERROELECTRIC LIQUID CRYSTALS (FLCS), A FAST, LOW-VOLTAGE, LOW-POWER ELECTROOPTIC MATERIAL,WITH SILICON INTEGRATED CIRCUITS (ICS). THIS DEVICE HAS A 4.5 KHZ FRAME RATE, THEREFORE IT SHOULD BE CAPABLE OF STEERING A BEAM FROM ONE DIRECTION TO ANOTHER IN A TIME OF 220 US. IN THIS PHASE I WORK WE PROPOSE TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CURRENT DISPLAYTECH FLC-ICSLM USED AS AN OPA, IDENTIFY AND DEVELOP ALGORITHMS FOR BEAM FORMING AND STEERING, AND DO PRELIMINARY DESIGN OF A MORE ADVANCED FLC-ICSLM OPTIMIZED FOR BEAM FORMING AND STEERING. THE AIM OF THE PHASE I WORK WILL BE TO PROVIDE A BASIS FOR THE FABRICATION OF MORE ADVANCED DEVICES IN PHASE II. ??????????",

THIS RESEARCH WILL (1) IDENTIFY RECENT PUBLISHED STUDIES FOR WHICH SEQUENTIAL DESIGNS WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN SUBSTANTIAL SAMPLE SIZE REDUCTION, (2) DEVELOP COMPUTER SOFTWARE TO REPLACE AND EXPAND THE LIMITED TABLES CURRENTLY USED FOR THE UP-AND-DOWN METHOD, (3) APPLY THIS SOFTWARE TO EVALUATE THE SENSITIVITY OF THESE METHODS TO PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS AND VIOLATIONS OF ASSUMPTIONS, AND (4) DEVELOP GUIDELINES FOR OBTAINING STANDARD ERRORS OF THE ESTIMATES FOR USE IN SIGNIFICANCE TESTING.",

GENETIC EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT IN AT LEAST ONE CASE AC HAS TAGGED A MALE STERILE GENE. WE HAVE USED AC AS A PROBE TO CLONE THIS ELEMENT AND THE DNA FLANKING IT. DURING PHASE I WE WILL THEN USE FLANKING SEQUENCES TO CLONE THE MALE STERILE ALLELEAND WE WILL CHARACTERIZE THE STRUCTURE AND EXPRESSION OF THIS GENE AS A PRELIMINARY STEP TO ISOLATING OTHER MALE STERIL MUTANTS, WE WILL ALSO DETERMINE WHETHER AC OR SPM HAS TRANSPOSED IN ANY OF THE OTHER MUTANTS. THESE TRANSPOSITIONAL EVENTS CAN BE DETECTED AS NOVEL RESTRICTION FRAGMENTS HYBRIDIZING TO AC OR SPM-SPECIFIC PROBES. OVER 17 NUCLEAR MS GENES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN MAIZE. THEDEVELOPMENTAL SEQUENCE OF MICROSPOROGENESIS BREAKDOWN HAS BEEN STUDIED IN A NUMBER OF CASES, BUT NO INFORMATION IS YETAVAILABLE ON THE CAUSES UNDERLYING MALE STERILITY. ISOLATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF MUCLEAR MS GENES WILL ENABLE US TO IDENTIFY THE PRIMARY GENE PRODUCTS RESPONSIBLE FOR MALE FERTILITY, WHICH SHOULD SERVE AS A HANDLE TOWARDS ULTIMATELY UNDERSTANDING THE MOLECULAR EVENTS INVOLVED IN MICROSPOROGENESIS. IN ADDITION, ISOLATION OF A MS GENE MAY ALLOW US TO UTILIZE NUCLEAR MALE STERILITY.",

IT IS A UNIQUE ENGINE COMBINING THE BETTER FEATURES OF PISTON, ROTARY, AND TURBINE ENGINES. IT HAS PISTON FUEL ECONOMY, 50% TO 75% LESS PARTS (LIKE A ROTARY), AND STREAMLINE TURBINE SHAPE AND SMOOTHNESS. ABOUT 75% LESS SPACE IS NEEDED TO INSTALL. THREE DIFFERENT SIZE DYNA-CAM ENGINE DESIGNS WILL BE EVALUATED IN PHASE I. THESE WILL BE HIGH-POWERED 4-STROKE OR 2-STROKE LOOP-SCAVENGED ENGINES, EITHER DIESEL OR MULTI-FUEL. ONE MODEL OF WHICH CAN PRODUCE 750 HP, AND WEIGHS JUST 450 LB. DRY OR 550 LB. MARINIZED. IT IS 16\" DIAMETER, THUS SMALL AS A TURBINE.

WE PROPOSE HERE TO DELAY TIP VORTEX CAVITATION BY INJECTION OF LONG CHAIN DRAG REDUCING POLYMERS IN THE TIP VORTEX CORE AND THUS REDUCING THE TIP VORTEX INDUCED CAVITATION NOISE. FOR THIS TO BE EFFECTIVE, WITHOUT ANY DRAWBACKS ON PROPELLER PERFORMANCE, THE INJECTION HAS TO BE SELECTIVE: THE POLYMERS HAVE TO BE INTRODUCED ONLY IN THE VISCOUS CORE OF THE TIP VORTEX. THE INJECTION HAS ALSO TO BE ON AN AS NEEDED BASIS TO MINIMIZE POLYMER SOLUTION CONSUMPTION, AND TRANSPORT CONSTRAINTS ON THE VESSEL. THESE TWO OBJECTIVES COULD BE ACHIEVED IF THE INJECTION PORTS ARE WELL LOCATED ON THE BLADES AND IF A FEED BACK MECHANISM IS ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE PROPELLER FLOW FIELD AND THE POLYMER SOLUTION INJECTION. WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS CONCEPT IN THE PHASE I EFFORT OF THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH PROGRAM. AN ACTUAL MODEL SCALE PROPELLER DESIGNED FOR A NAVY VESSEL WILL BE USED. ITS CHARACTERISTICS AND ITS CAVITATION INCEPTION CURVES WILL BE ESTABLISHED FOR A BASELINE. THEN THE PROPELLER WILL BE MODIFIED BY FITTING TWO OF ITS BLADES WITH FLUID INJECTION PORTS WHOSE POSITION WILL BE DETERMINED FROM THE VISUALIZATION OF THE FLOW AROUND THE UNMODIFIED PROPELLER. VARIOUS CONCENTRATIONS OF POLYMER SOLUTION INJECTIONS WILL THEN BE PERFORMED AND MODIFICATION OF THE CAVITATION INCEPTION CHARACTERISTICS SOUGHT. THE RESULTS WILL BE COMPARED WITH THE BASELINE TESTS AS WELL AS WITH PURE WATER AND WATER/GLYCERINE SOLUTION INJECTION IN THE SAME AMOUNTS.

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE IMPORTANCE OF ASEISMIC DESIGN OF STRUCTURES USING BASE ISOLATION TECHNIQUES IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY EVIDENT TO ARCHITECTS AND STRUCTURAL ENGINEERS. MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF BASE ISOLATORS, GENERALLY COMPLEX MECHANICAL SYSTEMS WHICH REQUIRE AN EXTRA FLOOR BENEATH THE BUILDING, HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO DATE. EXISTING ISOLATION SYSTEMS ARE EITHER OF A PURE-FRICTION OR FLEXIBLE TYPE, OR A COMBINATIONOF THE TWO. THEY REDUCE EARTHQUAKE-INDUCED LATERAL INERTIAL FORCES ON STRUCTURES THROUGH LIMITING FRICTION EFFECTS AND/OR LENGTHENING THE NATURAL PERIOD OF VIBRATION OF THE TOTAL SYSTEM. FRICTIONAL PROPERTIES ARE USUALLY PROVIDED USING STACKED TEFLON-COATED STEEL PLATES, WHILE FLEXIBILITY IS PROVIDED BY ELASTOMERIC RUBBER PADS. A NEW BASE ISOLATION SYSTEM COMPRISED OF ALTERNATE GEOSYNTHETIC LINERS AND SOIL LAYERS IS PROPOSED TO BE EVALUATED AND IMPLEMENTED. GEOMEMBRANE AND GEOTEXTILE GEOSYNTHETICS TYPICALLY HAVE VERY LOW FRICTION COEFFICIENTS. A LAYERED GEOTEXTILE/GEOMEMBRANE-SOIL SYSTEM PROVIDES A PRACTICAL, LOW-COST, AND SIMPLE-TO-INSTALL BASE ISOLATION SYSTEM THROUGH LOW FRICTIONAL PROPERTIES OF GEOSYNTHETICS AND THE FLEXBILITY OF A SOIL LAYER. LATERAL DEFLECTION OF STRUCTURES MAY BE LIMITED BY HYSTERETIC DAMPING OF THE SOIL LAYER AND BY SOFT BACKFILL MATERIALS AROUND THE BUILDING BASEMENT. THE EXPERIMENTAL AND ANALYTICAL STUDIES PROPOSED WILL VERIFY THE EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM.",

HOWEVER, THEIR COST AND AVAILABILITY ARE A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO WIDESPREAD APPLICABILITY. SELECTIVE ENRICHMENT OF CALCIUM ISOTOPES USING LASER TECHNIQUES OFFERS THE POTENTIAL TO ELIMINATE THE COST/AVAILABILITY BARRIER. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE APPLICATION OF LASERS TO ATOMIC PHYSICS PROBLEMS INDICATE THAT MODERN LASER TECHNOLOGY MAY BE USED TO SELECTIVELY ENRICH CALCIUM ISOTOPES THROUGH ONE OR ALL OF SEVERAL MECHANISMS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO USE SELECTIVE LASER RESONANCE IONIZATION MASS SPECTROMETRY TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY AND EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL FOR THE LASER ENRICHMENT OF STABLE CALCIUM ISOTOPES. TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT INCLUDE: 1) DETERMINE EFFICIENCIES OF TWO-PHOTON RESONANCE IONIZATION PROCESSES; 2) EVALUATE IONIZATION SELECTIVITIES AND OVERALL ENRICHMENT SYSTEM THROUGHPUT; 3) THEORETICALLY AND EXPERIMENTALLY EVALUATE HIGHLY SELECTIVE ISOTOPIC IONIZATION.",

LEGUMINOUS CROPS SUCH AS SOYBEAN AND ALFALFA USE BOTH SOIL NITROGEN AND, WHEN SUITABLE STRAINS OF THE NITROGEN-FIXING MICROSYMBIONTS BRADYRHIZOBIUM AND RHIZOBIUM ARE AVAILABLE, ATMOSPHERIC NITROGEN. IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED THAT THE 50 MILLION HECARES OF CULTIVATED GRAIN AND FORAGE LEGUMES IN THE UNITED STATES OBTAINED MORE THAN 6 MILLION METRIC TONS OF NITROGEN ANNUALLY FROM RHIZOBIAL NITROGEN REDUCTION EVEN THOUGH THE INDIGENOUS RHIZOBIA ARE FREQUENTLYINEFFICIENT NITROGEN REDUCERS. THE SYMBIOTIC RHIZOBIA/HOST NITROGEN-FIXING RELATIONSHIP IS CHARACTERIZED BY MICROSYMBIONT COLONIZATION OF HOST DERIVED ROOT NODULES. THESE NODULES DEVELOP IN A COMPLEX SERIES OF STEPS WHICH AREBELIEVED TO BE INITIATED BY THE ACTION OF PLANT-DERIVED FLAVONOIDS ON THE BACTERIUM THROUGH ITS NODULATION GENES ANDGENE PRODUCTS. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE FLAVONOIDS IN SYMBIOSIS SUGGESTS THAT THEY MAY BE OF VALUE IN THE MANIPULATION OF THE SYMBIOTIC PROCESS TO IMPROVE NITROGEN- REDUCTION EFFICIENCY AND, AS A CONSEQUENCE, CROP YIELD. THIS PROJECT IS DIRECTED TO DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION OF THE BICHEMICAL TOOLS REQUIRED TO DEVELOP A MORE COMPLETE MODEL OF THE FLAVONOID/SYMBIOSIS RELATIONSHIP. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH HAS CURRENT POTENTIAL FOR USE BY BOTH THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR RESEARCH COMMUNITIES IN THE ELUCIDATION OF THE SYMBIOTIC RHIZOBIUM/LEGUME NITROGEN- FIXING PROCESS. THE POTENTIAL POST APPLICATIONS OF THIS PROJECT ARE THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF PRACTICAL AGRICULTURAL METHODS FOR INCREASING THE EFFICIENCY OF NITROGEN-FIXATION THROUGH MODIFICATION OF THE RHIZOBIUM/ MESSENGER/LEGUME INTERACTION AND DEVELOPMENT OF A GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF MICROBE/PLANT INTERACTIONS.

AS A RESULT, HAND-WRITTEN IFSP'S MUST BE CONSTANTLY MODIFIED TO REFLECT CHILD GROWTH AND NEW DEVELOPMENTAL GOALS - A SIGNIFICANT ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN FOR PROFESSIONAL STAFF, A SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE FOR ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF AND A CONFUSING PROCESS FOR FAMILIES. A COMPUTER SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS THE THERAPIST AND TEACHERS TO MONITOR GROWTH AND PLAN FOR ACHIEVEMENT IN AN EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE MANNER IS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN THE QUALITY OF SERVICE FOR A CONSTANTLY INCREASING POPULATION. THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP AN IFSP SYSTEM THAT WILL: 1) PROVIDE BASIC ADMINISTRATIVE DATA ON EACH CHILD; 2) ACCURATELY DESCRIBE SKILLS, ABILITIES AND NEEDS OF THE CHILD AND FAMILY; 3) OUTLINE NEAR-TERM GOALS AND OBJECTIVESFOR THE CHILD AND FAMILY; 4) MONITOR THE OUTLINED GOALS, NOTING ACHIEVEMENT, ADDING NEW GOALS, AND MODIFYING GOALS BASED UPON THE CHILD'S GROWTH; 5) PROVIDE CHILD AND FAMILY WITH CLEAR AND UNDERSTANDABLE IFSP'S AND PROGRESS REPORTS.

IT IS PLANNED TO INVESTIGATE TUBULAR ULTRAMICROBAND ELECTRODES, <1 MUM WIDE, FOR THIS APPLICATION. THESE MICROELECTRODES SHOULD GIVE AMPEROMETRIC RESPONSES PROPORTIONAL TO CONCENTRATION AND INDEPENDENT OF FLOW RATE OVER A WIDE RANGE AND COULD BE INTEGRATED INTO THE COLUMN TO AVOID POSTCOLUMN DISPERSION OFELUENT COMPONENTS BEFORE DETECTION. IN ADDITION, VERY FAST DYNAMIC VOLTAMMETRY POSSIBLE FOR MICROELECTRODES WILL ALLOW SEPARATION OF OVERLAPPING ELUENT COMPONENTS WITH SIMILAR OXIDATION POTENTIALS, BASED ON THEIRDIFFERING ELECTROKINETICS. THE MICROBAND ELECTRODES ARE SIMPLE TO FABRICATE FROM A VARIETY OF ELECTRODE MATERIALS AND MAY BE PRODUCED SINGLY OR IN SERIAL ARRAYS WITH INDIVIDUAL POTENTIAL CONTROL. PHASE I WILL SEEK TO DEMONSTRATE ONE- AND TWO-ELEMENT MICROBAND ELECTRODES AND TO EVALUATE THE GEOMETRIC REQUIREMENTS FOR FLOW-INDEPENDENT AMPEROMETRIC RESPONSE TOWARD MODEL REDOX SPECIES AND BIOGENIC AMINES. PHASE II WILL BE USED TO DEVELOP FURTHER THE ELECTRODE MATERIALS AND FABRICATION TECHNOLOGY FOR THIN-FILM MULTIELEMENT ARRAYS AND TO DEMONSTRATE AND OPTIMIZE PROTOTYPE HARDWARE IN A MICROBORE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPH FOR ENHANCED SEPARATION OF BIOGENIC AMINES IN CLINICAL SAMPLE VOLUMES.",

IN THIS STUDY, NITROCELLULOSE MEMBRANES WILL EITHER BIND THE CLOTTING FACTOR BY BLOTTING TRANSFER OR BE USED AS A SUBSTRATE VEHICLE FOR IDENTIFICATION OF THE LOCATION OF BANDS FROM ELECTROPHEROGRAMS; THE MEMBRANES WILL BE FIBRINOGEN COATED AND BLOCKED WITH CASEIN. ELCA ASSAYS WILLBE PERFORMED BY ADDING SUBSTRATE CONTAINING ALL FACTORS NEEDED FOR ASSAY OF A PARTICULAR FACTOR INCLUDING LABELED FIBRINOGEN. TWO PROTOCOLS FOR IDENTIFICATION OF THE SEPARATED COMPONENTSWILL BE USED. IN THE FIRST, THE SOLID PHASE WILL HAVE BOUND TO IT CLOTTING FACTORS TRANSFERRED FROM NONDENATURING ELECTROPHEROGRAMS; IN THE SECOND, THE SOLID PHASE WILL BE OVERLAID DIRECTLY ONTO POLYACRYLAMIDE GELS WITH SEPARATED CLOTTING FACTORS.

TO MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS, AN INNOVATIVE TECHNIQUE IS PROPOSED FOR FABRICATING LARGE-AREA LONG WAVELENGTH INFRARED (LWIR) DETECTOR ARRAYS THAT CAN BE OPERATED AT ROOM TEMPERATURE. THIS TECHNIQUE UTILIZES ESTABLISHED TECHNOLOGIES OF MICRO-MACHINING AND MICROELECTRONIC PROCESSING OF SILICON (SI) WAFERS FOR FABRICATING MONOLITHIC ARRAYS OF LWIR DETECTORS. THE DETECTOR ELEMENTS OF THE ARRAY ARE FORMED BY AN ULTRA-THIN FILM OF A BOLOMETER MATERIAL PROCESSING THE HIGHEST TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENT OF RESISTANCE KNOWN, AND THE READOUT ELECTRONIC MICROCIRCUIT IS FABRICATED ON THE SAME SILICON CHIP NEXT TO THE ELEMENTS. THE RESULTANT DETECTOR ARRAYS WILL POSSESS FEATURES OF LOW COST, LOW WEIGHT, HIGH RESPONSIVITY AND HIGH SENSITIVITY. THE LOW COST IS DUE TO A SINGLE BATCH PROCESS IN THE ARRAY FABRICATION. THE LOW WEIGHT IS DUE TO A MONOLITHIC ARRAY STRUCTURE REQUIRING NO COOLING. THE HIGH RESPONSIVITY IS DUE TO A LARGE TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENT OF RESISTIVITY (>15% COMPARED TO 0.2% FOR A CONVENTIONAL BOLOMETER) OF OUR NEW BOLOMETER MATERIAL. THE HIGH SENSITIVITY IS DUE TO THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF HIGH RESPONSIVITY, LOW NOISE AND HIGH THERMAL ISOLATION OF THE BOLOMETER FROM ITS SURROUNDINGS.",

RECENT ADVANCES IN SEMICONDUCTOR BANDGAP ENGINEERING BY MOLECULAR BEAM EPITAXY (MBE) HAVE PRODUCED QUANTUMWELL DETECTORS IN THE FORM OF SUPERLATTICES (SLS) WITH VERY NARROW SPECTRAL BANDS IN THE INFRARED. THE SL DETECTORS CAN BE USED TO CONSTRUCT AN IMAGING SPECTROMETER WITH HIGH SPATIAL AND SPECTRAL RESOLUTION THAT CAN MEET THIS NEED. THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP A VERTICAL STACK OF THESE SLS, EACH RESPONDING TO AN UNIQUE NARROW BAND, USING THE MBE GROWTH OF SLS OF ALGAAS/GAAS. BY ALTERING THE PERIODICITY OF THE SLS THE INFRARED BANDS WILL BE CHANGED SO THAT THE QUANTUM-WELL DETECTORS FORMING AN IR SPECTROMETER WILL RESPOND TO THE BANDS SIMULTANEOUSLY. AN ARRAY OF THESE SL STACKS WILL BE USED TO FORM THE FINAL IMAGING SPECTROMETER EITHER IN THE STARING OR SCANNING MODE. SPECIAL EFFUSION SOURCES, MBE EPITAXIAL GROWTH PROCESSES AND FEW TRAIL EPITAXY GROWTH RUNS WILL BE DESIGNED, DELINEATED AND MADE, RESPECTIVELY, IN PHASE I FOR THE SPECTROMETER DEVELOPMENT.

IT WILL ALSO BE MORE EFFICIENT IN OBTAINING VIRTUALLY 100% CONVERSION THAN ANY CONVENTIONAL METHODS AND IT WILL BE SMALLER IN SIZE THAN ANY CONVENTIONAL INCINERATOR. ADVANCED PREPARATION TECHNIQUES OF AEROGEL CATALYSTS WILL BEUSED TO PREPARE DIFFERENT MULTICOMPONENT CATALYTIC SYSTEMS FOR HIGHER ACTIVITY AND STABILITY. THE MAJOR ADVANTAGES OF THIS PREPARATION PROCEDURE IS THAT METALLIC COMPONENTS CAN BE COMBINED IN ANY PROPORTION AND THAT IT PRODUCES HIGH SURFACE AREA AND HIGHLY POROUS MATERIALS. THE INFORMATION GATHERED WILL BE USED TO DESIGN A CATALYTIC SYSTEM THAT WOULD OPTIMIZE THE TOTAL OXIDATION OF HYDROCARBONS IN TERMS OF FINAL PRODUCTS AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION.",

THERE IS A CLEARLY ESTABLISHED NEED FOR RECHARGEABLE HIGH ENERGY CELLS AND BATTERIES FOR SPACE POWER TECHNOLOGY. THIS CALLS FOR MORE ENERGETIC LITHIUM SYSTEMS THAT HAVE BEEN STUDIED SO FAR, WITH PRACTICAL ENERGY DENSITIES IN EXCESS OF 250 WH/KG. A NEW APPROACH IS PROPOSED TOWARDS AMBIENT TEMPERATURE HIGH ENERGY LITHIUM BATTERIES BASED ON TWO NEW KEY IDEAS. ONE IS TO USE REDUCIBLE CATHODES INSTEAD OF INTERCALATION MATERIALS AND THE OTHER TO EMPLOY INORGANIC ELECTROLYTES AS A BASIS FOR HIGH RATE CAPABILITY AND A GREATER LONG RANGE STABILITY. REDUCIBLE CATHODES OFFER HIGHER ENERGY AND POWER DENSITIES OVER A WIDER TEMPERATURE RANGE AND SHOULD BE CAPABLE OF LONGER CYCLE LIVES AS WELL. NEW CATHODES ARE PROPOSED BECAUSE OF THEIR PARTICULARLY HIGH ENERGY DENSITY AND LOW SOLUBILITY IN THE ELECTROLYTE WHICH WOULD BE THE BASIS FOR GREATER STABILITY NEEDED FOR A LONG CYCLE LIFE. THEORETICAL ENERGY DENSISITES IN EXCESS OF 1300 WH/KG ARE INVOLVED IN THESE REDUCIBLE CATHODE SYSTEMS COMPARED TO ONLY 480-700 AVAILABLE FROM THE BEST INSERTION TYPES. THUS, THE PROPOSED PROGRAM REPRESENTS A NEW APPROACH AND A CLEAR DEPARTURE FROM RECENT TRENDS IN THIS FIELD.",

THE PROGRAMMING TIME FOR THESE MINIATURE FILTERS IS LESS THAN 100 USECS, THE TECHNOLOGY EXISTS TO PROGRAM THE CENTER FREQUENCY ACROSS THE 225 TO 400 MHZ BAND AND THE BANDWIDTH IS PROGRAMMABLE TO VALUES LESS THAN 25 KHZ. THE STANDOFF DYNAMIC RANGE OF ACT PROGRAMMABLE FILTERS IS IN THE 85 TO 95 DB RANGE FOR THE 25 KHZ CHANNELS. THIS DYNAMIC RANGE IS INADEQUATE FOR THE VERY DEMANDING CO-SITE REQUIREMENTS. THIS PROGRAM WILL UPGRADE THE PRESENT FILTERS WITH A PROGRAMMABLE MATCHING NETWORK AT THE INPUT IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE STANDOFF DYNAMIC RANGE AND SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASE THE NOISE FIGURE.

RATHER THAN THE USUAL STORED REFERENCE APPROACHES THAT EXHIBIT EITHER LONG ACQUISITION AND SYNCHRONIZATION CYCLES OR LIMITED PROCESSING GAIN AND JAMMING MARGIN, THE APPROACH USES A TRANSMITTED REFERENCE CONFIGURATION IN WHICH THE PROCESSING GAIN IS SET BY THE PRODUCT OF THE TRANSMITTED BANDWIDTH AND THE INTEGRATION TIME. THE PROCESSOR CONFIGURATION FEATURES VIRTUALLY UNLIMITED PROCESSING GAIN POTENTIAL, LOW DETECTABILITY, AND EXCELLENT JAMMING MARGINS TO NOISE AND PULSE SIGNALS. THIS CONFIGURATION HAS NOT BEEN EXPLOITED IN THE PAST PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF ITS PARTICULAR SUSCEPTIBILITY TO CW JAMMING. THE ADVENT OF ACT SIGNAL PROCESSING ALLOWS A HIGH PERFORMANCE ADAPTIVE CW EXCISION CIRCUIT TO BE INCORPORATED IN THE SYNCHRONIZATION PROCESSOR TO ADD THE REQUIRED JAM RESISTANCE. THE GOAL OF THE PROGRAM IS TO ACHIEVE PROCESSING GAIN IN EXCESS OF 30 DB. A BREADBOARD PROCESSOR USING EXISTING ACT SUBSYSTEMS WILL BE CONSTRUCTED AND TESTED TO PROVIDE DATA FOR CONCEPT OPTIMIZATION.",

THE BASE BUOY SERVES AS A NAVIGATION BEACON, ENERGY SOURCE, TELEMETRY LINK AND SURFACE SENSOR PLATFORM. EACH AOV FUNCTIONS AS A SUBSURFACE SENSOR PLATFORM, SHORT TERM DATA LOGGER AND PROGRAMMABLE, NAVAGABLE VESSEL. DEVELOPMENT OF SYSTEM COMPONENTS CAPITALIZES ON RECENT INVESTMENTS BY DOD AND INDUSTRY IN BUOY AND VESSEL TECHNOLOGY.

THE INCUBATION AND INJECTION OF DEAD, CONTAMINATED EGGS CAN CONTAMINATE INCUBATIORS AND IN OVO INJECTION SYSTEMS AND SPREAD DISEASE AGENTS TO EGGS WHICH ARE SUBSEQUENTLY INCUBATED AND/OR INJECTED BY THE SYSTEM. A SUCCESSFUL AUTOMATIC EGG VIABILITY DETECTOR SYSTME MUST BE MORE ACCURATE, RELIABLE, AND COST EFFECTIVE THAN THE MANUAL DISCRIMINATION SYSTEM (CANDLERS) CURRENTLY USED IN THE POULTRY INDUSTRY. EMBREX IS DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT OF VIABILITY DISCRIMINATION BY RELATIVE EGG TEMPERATURE. MANUALLY COLLECTED DATA SHOWS THE VALIDITY OF THIS CONCEPT. COMMERCIAL MACHINES WILL BE MARKETED AS STAND-ALONE DEVICE AND AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF AN IN OVO VACCINATION SYSTEM. IN PHASE I EMBREX WILL BUILD A SEMIAUTOMATIC MACHINE CAPABLEOF MEASURING TEMPERATURES OF INCUBATING EGGS AND WILL USE THIS MACHINE TO COLLECT DATA TO VERIFY THE RELATIVE TEMPERATURE DISCRIMINATION METHOD. THIS DATA WILL ALLOW DESIGN OF A COMPUTER DISCRIMINATION ALGORITHM. PHASE II WILL DESIGN, BUILD AND HATCHERY TEST A FULLY AUTOMATIC, 20,000 EGGS PER HOUR MACHINE WHICH DETECTS AND MARKS INFERTILE, DEAD AND CONTAMINATED EGGS. IN PHASE III THE EMBRYO VIABILITY DETECTOR WILL BE MARKETED AS BOTH A STAND-ALONE MACHINE AND AS PART OF EMBREX'S IN OVO EGG VACCINATION AND INJECTION SYSTEM.",

THE EXTREME TOXICITY OF ARSINE GAS, WHICH MUST BE STORED IN HIGH-PRESSURE STEEL CYLINDERS, COULD LEAD TO CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES IN CASE OF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF A LARGE QUANTITY OF ARSINE. IN THE FUTURE, USE OF ARSINE MAY BE SEVERLY RESTRICTED OR PROHIBITED, AND THE SUPPLY OF GAAS-BASED MILITARY DEVICES, INCLUDING MIMICS AND OPTOELECTRONIC COMPONENTS, COULD NOT BE GUARANTEED. LOW VAPOR PRESSURE LIQUID ARSINE DERIVATIVES, WHICH AVOID THE RISKS AND HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF ARSINE, HAVE BEEN UNDER INVESTIGATION OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. THE COMPOUNDS REPORTED IN THE LITERATURE INCLUDE TRIMETHYLARSINE, TRIETHYLARSINE DIMETHYLARSINE, MONOETHYLARSINE, DIETHYLARSINE, PHENYLARSINE AND TERTIARYBUTYLARSINE (TBA). THE FIRST THREE OF THESE MATERIALS WERE FOUND TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR UNACCEPTABLY HIGH CARBON ACCEPTOR CONCENTRATIONS CAUSED BY AN INTRINSIC PYROLYSIS MECHANISM. FOR MONOETHYL, DIETHYL AND PHENYLARSINE, IT REMAINS TO BE DEMONSTRATED THAT ECONOMIC PURIFICATION TECHNIQUES CAN BE DEVELOPED, AND THAT THEIR INTRINSIC CHEMISTRY IS ADEQUATE TO ACHIEVE SEMICONDUCTOR GRADE PURITY. IN THE CASE OF TBA, SYNTHESIS AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN DEVELOPED WHICH CONSISTENTLY YIELDS A PRODUCT OF HIGH PURITY AND EXCELLENT MATERIALS RESULTS HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED MAKING IT THE LEADING CANDIDATE FOR AN ASH3-FREE COMPOUND SEMICONDUCTOR TECHNOLOGY. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMUNICATION APPLICATIONS - THE DEVELOPMENT OF TBA AS AN ASH3 SUBSTITUTE SHOWS GREAT PROMISE AS THE BASIS OF A COMMERCIALLY VIABLE III/V EPITAXIAL TECHNOLOGY.

THIS RELIES ON THE ACOUSTO-OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF A CONTINUOUS LAYER OF LIQUID CRYSTAL THIN FILM LAYER WHICH SERVES AS BOTH THE SENSOR AND THE DISPLAY. THE IMAGE CAN BE VIEWED DIRECTLY BY MEANS OF CCD CAMERA. HOLOGRAPHY PROVIDES FOR BOTH REDUNDANCY AND INCREASED RESOLUTION AS PROPAGATION THROUGH THE MEDIUM IS MADE BOTH EASIER AND MORE ACCURATE BY USING TWO WAVELENGTHS. IT UTILIZES TECHNIQUES SIMILAR TO OPTICAL HOLOGRAPHY WHERE AN ULTRASONIC WAVE ORIGINATING FROM AN OBJECT IS MADE TO INTERFERE WITH A REFERENCE WAVE PRODUCING AN INTERFERENCE PATTERN THAT IS A HOLOGRAM WHICH IS VIEWED 3-D DIMENSIONALLY ON THE DETECTION PANEL. THE CONTRACTOR WILL INVESTIGATE FEASIBILITY BY SYNTHESIZING AND TESTING LIQUID CRYSTAL MIXTURES SHOWN IN ITS PATENT. A POLARIZED BEAM OF LIGHT WILL BE USED TO MEASURE CHANGES IN DICHROISM BY MEASURING THE VARIATION OF ELLIPTICITY AS A FUNCTION OF PRESSURE.",

WITH HIDRIVE, THE MOTOR SHAFT IS SOLID AND HAS NO WINDINGS OR LAMINATIONS. THIS PERMITS SCALING FOR OPERATION AT VERY HIGH SPEEDS (THE PHASE I DEMONSTRATION IS TO BE AT 28,000 RPM), RESULTING IN A HIGH POWER DENSITY AND EFFICIENCY WHILE OFFERING RUGGEDNESS AND SMOOTH OPERATION, DESIREABLE QUALITIES FOR AIRBORNE APPLICATIONS. THE HIGH FREQUENCY POWER GENERATED PERMITS CONVERSION TO A VERY SMOOTH DC VOLTAGE OUTPUT. ALL LAMINATIONS AND WINDINGS ARE STATIONARY AND NO BRUSHES ARE USED, THEREBY ELIMINATING TRADITIONAL MECHANICAL INTEGRITY PROBLEMS DUE TO DYNAMIC FORCES. ENCOTECH, INC. PROPOSED TO ADAPT A HIDRIVE SYSTEM SCALED TO PRODUCE 10 WATTS OF 12-15 VDC ELECTRIC POWER WHEN DRIVEN BY A MODEL AIRPLANE ENGINE. THE PHASE I EFFORT WILL BE TO PRODUCE A DEMONSTRATION BENCH TEST RIG. PHASE II ACTIVITIES WILL ADDRESS THE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE OF TWO DIFFERENT SIZE FLYABLE PROTOTYPE SYSTEMS TO DEMONSTRATE BOTH THE SOUNDNESS OF THE DESIGN AND ITS SCALABILITY. DARPA OR APPROPRIATE OTHER AGENCY INTENDED MISSION EQUIVALENT SPECIFICATIONS ARE TO BE ESTABLISHED AND MET. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - THE FLEXIBILITY AND ADAPTABILITY OF THE HIDRIVE DESIGN CONCEPT PERMITS ITS USE AS BOTH ELEMENTS OF A LONG-DURATION MOTOR-GENERATOR SET. IT ALSO MAY BE USED AS A SOURCE OF GENERATION OF ELECTRIC POWER HAVING UNUSUAL OR SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS. IT IS APPLICABLE TO AIRCRAFT, SONOBOUYS, DRONES, SURVEILLANCE VEHICLES, OR OTHER SIMILAR REMOTE OR HOSTILE APPLICATIONS IN A WIDE RANGE OF SIZES.",

OF THESE, 12 TO 34 PERCENT OF THE CASES CONSISTENTLY RESULT IN RESTENOSIS AND THE NEED TO REOPEN OR BYPASS THE OCCLUDED PORTION OF THE VESSEL. ONE OF THE PRIMARY CAUSES OF RESTENOSIS IS THE ACCUMULATION OF PLATELETS IN THE AREA DENUDED BY ANGIOPLASTY, WHICH IN TURN PRODUCE PLATELET-DERIVED GROWTH FACTOR, A STRONG CHEMOATTRACTANT FOR SMOOTH MUSCLE CELLS. THE ACCUMULATION OF SMOOTH MUSCLE CELLS LEADS TO HYPERPLASIA ANDULTIMATELY TO OCCLUSION OF THE VESSEL. THIS RESEARCH IS DIRECTED AT DEVELOPING A SYSTEM TO RE-SEED THE DENUDED PORTION OF THE VESSEL WITH AUTOLOGOUS ENDOTHELIAL CELLS TO CIRCUMVENT THE ACCUMULATION OF PLATELETS. THIS WILL BE DONE BY DEVELOPING A CELL-SEEDING MATRIX DESIGNED TO SUSPEND CELLS IN DURING THE SEEDING PROCESS AND A CELL DELIVERY SYSTEM. THE DEVELOPED MATRIX AND DELIVERY SYSTEM WILL BE TESTED IN AN IN VITRO PERFUSION LOOP (PHASE I), FOLLOWED BY IN VIVO APPLICATION (PHASE II) IN A DENUDED CANINE ARTERY. THIS WILL REQUIRE DEVELOPING A SEEDING MATRIX THAT WILL ENHANCE CELL ATTACHMENT TO THE DENUDED VESSEL AND TESTING THE CELL-SEEDING SYSTEM FOR DELIVERY OF THE CELLS TO THE DENUDEDVESSEL.",

HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE NORMALLY LOW CONCENTRATIONS OF CONTAMINANTS ABSORBED ON SOILS, FUEL IS REQUIRED TO HEAT THE SOIL MASS TO TEMPERATURES NEAR 2,000 F. CURRENT THERMAL TREATMENT PROCESSES ARE INEFFICIENT IN THEIRUSE OF FUEL BECAUSE OF FAILURETO RECOVER HEAT FROM THE DECONTAMINATED SOILS AND FUEL GASES LEAVING THE COMBUSTION ZONE OF THE INCINERATOR. A UNIQUE, THERMALLY EFFICIENT, STAGED, FLUIDIZED BED CONCEPT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED WHICH REDUCES TREATMENT COSTS BY AFFECTING A HIGH DEGREE OF HEAT RECOVERY FROM EFFLUENT STREAMS LEAVING THE COMBUSTION STAGE.THE FOUNDATION OF THE CONCEPT IS BASED UPON TWO ASSUMPTIONS:1. THAT THERMAL EQUILIBRIUM CAN BE ATTAINED BETWEEN CONTACTING CAS AND SOLID STREAMS IN SHALLOW FLUIDIZED BEDS; AND THAT, 2. SOLIDS RESIDENCE TIME DISTRIBUTION IN SHALLOW FLUIDIZED BEDS DO NOT APPROACH WELL-STIRRED BEHAVIOR, AND THUS MAY BE SUITABLE FOR THE ATTAINMENT OF HIGH DESTRUCTION EFFICIENCIES WITHOUT REQUIRING EXTRAORDINARILY LONG RESIDENCE ON THE COMBUSTION STAGE.

THE LATTER FEATURE IS DOUBLY IMPORTANT, CONTRIBUTING TO HIGH OILYIELD AND TO THE GENERATION OF REACTIVE COKE WHICH CAN BE THOROUGHLY BURNED BELOW 1000F WHEN CARBONATE MINERALS ARE PRESENT, TO AVOID ENDOTHERMAL CALCINATION OF THE CARBONATES. THE ROTARY RETORT ACHIEVES THE MULTI-OPERATION PROCESS IN A SINGLE VESSEL WHICH CUTS 70% OFF THE OPERATION AND EQUIPMENT COSTS OF SOME LESS EFFICIENT PROCESSES. THE CCSSHT RETORT HELPS TO MITIGATE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS IN SEVEN IMPORTANT AREAS. THESE ARE (1) 80% REDUCED ATMOSPHERIC CONTAMINATING COMBUSTION PRODUCTS, (2) VIRTUAL ELIMINATION OF CARBONATE CALCINATION CO2 (AN ATMOSPHERE CONTAMINANT) AND (3) ASH THAT IS THOROUGHLY CLEANED OF COKE,(4) THAT HAS LOW ALKALI CONTENT, (5) THAT HAS RELATIVELY COARSE PARTICLE SIZE AND (6) IS COOL WHEN EJECTED TO THE ENVIRONMENT. FINALLY, (7) SINCE SOLID-TO-SOLID HEAT TRANSFER USES NO WATER, CCSSHT WILL ALSO CONSERVE WATER. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROPOSED PHASE I PROJECT IS TO OBTAIN DATA FOR THE DESIGN AND OPERATION OF ONE PART OF THE CCSSHT PROCESS DEVELOPMENT KILN, THE GAS LOCK, AND TO DEMONSTRATE THE GAS LOCK FUNCTIONALITY WITH A COLD FLOW STUDY IN A SMALLPLASTIC ROTARY VESSEL. SUBSEQUENT TO THIS PHASE I PROJECT, PHASES II AND III WILL CONSTRUCT A PROTOTYPE PROCESS RETORT AND DEMONSTRATE WITH A CONTINUOUS PROCESSING UNIT THE CLAIMSOF HIGH EFFICIENCY, LOW COST AND OTHER ADVANTAGES.",

A METHOD HAS BEEN FOUND TO IMPREGNATE POPPED PERLITE GRANULES WITH A LIQUID PHASE CHANGE MATERIAL (PCM) SUCH AS CALCIUM CHLORIDE HEXAHYDRATESUCH THAT THE GRANULES, WHEN SATURATED, REMAIN SURFACE DRY. THIS METHOD ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR HERMETIC ENCAPSULATION, GREATING REDUCING THE COST AND CREATING OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE HEAT TRANSFER EFFECTIVENESS TO AND FROM THE PCM. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN USED IN AN ACTIVELY CHARGED AND DISCHARGED THERMAL ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEM TO SHIFT PEAK COOLING AND HEATING LOADS, ROOM AIR MIGHT BE BLOWN THROUGH THE PERLITE GRANULES IN DIRECT CONTACT, MAXIMIZING HEAT TRANSFER EFFECTIVENESS. OR THIN-WALLED PLASTIC CONTAINERS COULD BE USED. ANOTHER WAY TO SHIFT DEMAND IS TO USE THE MIXTURE PASSIVELY AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR INSULATION IN EXTERIOR WALLS, DELAYING AND REDUCING HEAT TRANSFER THROUGH THE WALL. THIS STUDY WILL ANALYZE THE FEASIBILITY OF USING THE PERLITE/PCM COMPOSITE FOR LOAD SHIFTING AND WILL CONDUCT CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENTAL TESTS TO ENSURE STABILITY AND TO MODEL PERFORMANCE.",

THE PROPOSED APPROACH WILL IDENTIFY REQUIRED MODIFICATIONS TO THE MIGRATING COMBUSTION CHAMBER, FULL EXPANSION ENGINE FOR DIESEL FUEL OPERATION. THIS ENGINE USES ONLY THREE MOVING PARTS, OPERATES ON A UNIQUE, HIGHLY EFFICIENT, PATENTED, OPERATING CYCLE AND HAS A ZERO PRESSURE, QUIET AND COOL EXHAUST (WITHOUT A MUFFLER). THIS TYPE OF ENGINE HAS ALREADY DEMONSTRATED HIGH TOLERANCE TO DETONATION WITH LOW OCTANE FUELS INCLUDING N-HEPTANE. ALSO A SMALL .4 HP ENGINE OF THIS TYPE HAS OPERATED ON DIESEL AND JP-8 FUELS WITH EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE AT A STABILIZED OPERATING TEMPERATURE. THE PROGRAM WILL EVALUATE: ATOMIZATION TECHNIQUES, VARIABLE EFFECTIVE COMPRESSION RATIO, SURFACE-TO-VOLUME METHODOLOGY, AND IGNITION SOURCE. COMPUTER LAYOUT AND MODELING WILL SUPPLEMENT THE ANALYSES. A THREE VIEW ENGINE DESIGN LAYOUT WITH PROJECTED PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS WILL BE ESTABLISHED. PARTIAL HARDWARE FABRICATION AND TESTING WILL ALSO BE PERFORMED TO VERIFY THE APPROACH FOR A PHASE II FABRICATION AND TEST PROGRAM.",

(ERCI) PROPOSES TO DEVELOP A PROTOTYPE NEURAL NETWORK BASED EXPERT SYSTEM (CONNECTIONIST EXPERT SYSTEM) FOR ASTF FAULT DIAGNOSIS. NEURAL NETWORKS ARE EXCELLENT FOR PARAMETER ESTIMATION AND RECOGNIZING PATTERNS IN SIGNAL DATA. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO DESIGN A NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURE TO DETECT FAULT THUS SIGNIFYING AND RESPONDING TO AN ABNORAL EVENT. ONCE A SUCCESSFUL ARCHITECTURE IS DESIGNED, AN EXPERT SYSTEM WILL BE BUILT USING THE RESULTING NEURAL NETWORK OUTPUT CURVE AS A PREMISE TO A RULE. THE NEURAL NETWORK BASED EXPERT SYSTEM CAN ADVISE THE ENGINEER AND/OR BE INTEGRATED TO THE EMERGENCY DETECTION AND RESPONSE (EDAR) FUNCTION WHICH IS A PART OF THE ASTF FAULT-TOLERANT CONTROL SYSTEM. PHASE I OF THIS PROJECT WILL IMPLEMENT A PROTOTYPE NEURAL ARCHITECTURE USING FAULT DATA GENERATED BY A SIMULATOR. THE RESULTANT NETWORK OUTPUT CURVES WILL BE USED AS RULE PREMISE FOR AN EXPERT SYSTEM, WHERE RULE CLAUSES WILL BE RECOMMENDATIONS TO ENGINEERS AND/OR THE EDAR FOR CONTROL OF ASTF. PHASE II OF THE PROJECT WILL EXTEND THE SYSTEM FROM PHASE I TO BUILD A CONNECTIONIST EXPERT SYSTEM FOR ATSF FAULT DIAGNOSIS. ??????????",

THE PRESSURE FIELD PATTERNS AND PERFORMANCE AGAINST SIMULATED AND HUMAN KIDNEY STONES IN WATER WILL BE DETERMINED. THE SSL TECHNIQUE EMPLOYS AN ESTABLISHED, U.S. TECHNOLOGY, WHOSE MEDICAL APPLICATION POTENTIAL WAS RECENTLY DEMONSTRATED IN PROOF-OF-PRINCIPLE TARGET STUDIES SPONSORED BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH. IT USES A CONICAL SHOCK TUBE TO BEAM \"CAP\" SHOCKS OF SPECIFIED PRESSURE, DURATION, AND SIZE BEYOND THE END OF THE TUBE. THIS AFFORDS UNIQUE CORRELATION OF STANDARD SPHERICAL SHOCK WAVE PARAMETERS WITH BIOLOGIC EFFECTS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES. THE EXPERIMENTS WILL UTILIZE IN COMMON: A TEST TANK, AN ELECTRIC ARC PULSE SOURCE, A HIGH RESOLUTION(PVDF) PRESSURE MEASUREMENTS SYSTEM, AND SIMULATED AND HUMANKIDNEY STONE TARGETS. HYDROCODE CALCULATIONS WILL SUPPORT AND GUIDE THE EXPERIMENTAL EFFORT. THIS EFFORT IS INTENDED TO DEMONSTRATE THROUGH SHOCK WAVE PROPAGATION AND TARGET DAMAGE STUDIES THAT SSL OFFERS GREAT POTENTIAL FOR ELIMINATING PATIENT INJURY AND PAIN ANCILLARY TO FS TREATMENT METHODS NOW UNIVERSALLY EMPLOYED TO BREAK UP KIDNEY STONES. THIS IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE AN ADVANCED, COMPETITIVE ALTERNATIVE TO PRESENT EXCLUSIVELY EUROPEAN SYSTEMS IN A RAPIDLY EXPANDING MARKET THAT WILL SOON ALSO INCLUDE GALLSTONE TREATMENT.",

OUR GOAL IS TO DEFINE A PACKAGE THAT MAY BE READILY DEPLOYED TO A REMOTE SITE, EITHER BY AIRBORNE MEANS OR BY A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL TRAVELLING ON FOOT. THE SENSOR PACKAGE SHOULD BE SELF-POWERED WITH SUFFICIENT BATTERY RESERVE TO SUPPORT OPERATION FOR PERIOD SPANNING AS MUCH AS SEVERAL WEEKS. THE SENSOR PACKAGE SHOULD ALSO BE SUFFICIENTLY RUGGED ALLOW DEPLOYMENT IN ALL TYPES OF TERRAIN AND SHOULD BE OPERABLE IN AN EXPOSED ENVIRONMENT POSSIBLY SUBJECT TO EXTREMES OF BOTH TEMPERATURE AND MOISTURE. VARIOUS SYSTEM CONFIGURATIONS WILL BE EXAMINED, INCLUDING SIGNAL SENSOR UNITS, DISTRIBUTED MULTISENSOR ARRAYS, AND VARIOUS HYBRID PACKAGES WHICH INCLUDE OTHER SENSOR TYPES (I.E., SEISMIC, MAGNETIC, PYROELECTRIC, AND OPTICAL). A PRELIMINARY DESIGN CONCEPT WILL BE DEVELOPED TO SERVE AS THE BASIS OF PHASE II EFFORTS. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - THIS EFFORT WILL BENEFIT THE FEDERAL GOVT. BY PROVIDING THE MILITARY AND OTHER GOVT. AGENCIES WITH AN EFFECTIVE INTELLIGENCE GATHERING AND UNIT SECURITY CAPABILITY.

THEIR PERSISTENCE IN SOIL AND SEDIMENT AND POSSIBLE EFFECTS ON HUMAN HEALTH HAVE SPARKED AN INTENSE INTEREST IN DEVELOPING A SAFE, ECONOMICAL MEANS FOR THEIR DESTRUCTION. IT IS OUR GOAL TO USE RECOMBINANT DNA TECHNOLOGIES TO DEVELOP A SUPERIOR BIOCHEMICAL PROCESS FOR THE MICROBIAL DESTRUCTION OF PCBS. RESEARCH BY DR. UNTERMAN AND HIS FORMER COLLEAGUES AT GE HAS CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED THE EXISTENCE OF AT LEAST TWO COMPLEMENTARY CLASSES OF AEROBIC PCB-DEGRADING BACTERIA AND THAT USE OF BOTH OF THESE CLASSES IN CONCERT CAN EFFECT A MUCH GREATER EXTENT OF PCB DESTRUCTION. IT IS ENVIROGEN'S ULTIMATE GOAL TO COMBINE THE PCB-DEGRADATIVE GENES FROM TWO OF THESE STRAINS, RESPECTIVELY, INTO ONE SUPERIOR, PCB-DEGRADATIVE MICROBE. THE GE GROUP HAS NOW CLONED THE GENES FROM A CLASSII ORGANISM. ALTHOUGH THE GENES FROM CLASS I MICROBES HAVE BEEN ISOLATED, WE PROPOSE TO ISOLATE, CLONE, AND GENETICALLYENGINEER THE GENES THAT ENCODE THE ENZYMES RESPONSIBLE FOR PCB CATABOLISM FROM ACINETOBACTER STRAIN P6, THE BEST CLASS I MICROORGANISM ISOLATED TO DATE.",

IN THIS SYSTEM, GLUCOSE OXIDASE IS IMMOBILIZED TO SEPHAROSE BEADS OR TO THE POLYMER BACKBONE OF THE INSULIN DELIVERY MATRIX. LYOPHILIZED INSULIN IS INCORPORATED INTO THE POLYMER MATRIX. THE RELEASE OF INSULIN IS CONTROLLED BY ITS DISSOLUTION AND DIFFUSION RATE. PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTS HAVE SHOWN THAT INCREASING THE INSULIN DISSOLUTION RATE RESULTS IN AN INCREASED INSULIN RELEASE RATE FROM THE MATRIX. THIS CHANGE IN INSULIN DISSOLUTION RATE CAN BE CONTROLLED BY ALTERING THE PH OF THEMICROENVIRONMENT OF THE MATRIX. THIS PH CHANGE CAN BE MEDIATED BY THE CONVERSION OF GLUCOSE TO GLUCONIC ACID BY THE IMMOBILIZED GLUCOSE OXIDASE. WHEN GLUCOSE CONCENTRATIONS RISE, THE ENZYME CATALYZES THE PRODUCTION OF GLUCONIC ACID AND LOWERS THE MICROENVIRONMENTAL PH OF THE MATRIX. THE LOWER PH RESULTS IN INCREASED INSULIN DISSOLUTION AND DIFFUSION FROM THE SYSTEM IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN GLUCOSE CONCENTRATION. THE ADVANTAGES TO THE DIABETIC OF AN INSULIN DELIVERY SYSTEMTHAT MORE CLOSELY MIMICS PHYSIOLOGIC INSULIN DELIVERY INCLUDE IMPROVED PATIENT COMPLIANCE AND IMPROVED SHORT- AND LONG-TERM THERAPY.

THE KEY TO THE ISOPERFORMANCE APPROACH IS TO INVERT THE QUESTION OF JOB PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT BY SETTING A DESIRED LEVEL OF TRAINING PERFORMANCE AND DERIVING HOW IT CAN BE ATTAINED BY DIFFERENTCOMBINATIONS OF THE CHIEF DRIVERS OF AVIATION SIMULATION SYSTEMS EFFECTIVENESS: PERSONNEL APTITUDE, SIMULATION AND TRAINING CHARACTERISTICS, AND EQUIPMENT VARIATIONS. ONCE THESE COMBINATIONS HAVE BEEN DETERMINED, CHOICES AMONG THEM CAN BE MADE IN TERMS OF MAXIMUM FEASIBILITIES OR MINIMUM COSTS. THE PROGRAM WILL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT AND SYSTEMS, PERSONNEL, AND TRAINING RESEARCH. IT LEAVES AN AUDIT TRAIL OF THE DECISION PROCESS. THIS PROPOSAL OUTLINES THE DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF THE ISOPERFORMANCE METHODOLOGY SPECIFICALLY FOR THE FAA TO PROVIDE A COMPUTERIZED DECISION AID FOR EVALUATION OF IN PLACE SYSTEMS AND FOR STRATEGIC PLANNING INVOLVING SELECTINGNEW TECHNOLOGIES AND TRAINING SYSTEMS. FOUR BROAD APPLICATIONS OF THE ISOPERFORMANCE METHODOLOGY FOR GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE INDUSTRY ARE: A MANAGEMENT DECISION AID, AN EXPERT SYSTEM FOR ORGANIZING TRAINING, MANPOWER AND EQUIPMENT APPLICATIONS, A FORMAL SYSTEM FOR CONDUCTING TRADE OFFS WHERE COST ANALYSES ARE CONDUCTED FOR EXISTING SYSTEMS, AND A WAY FOR INDUSTRY TO MEET THE FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS IN A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).",

STRUCTURAL INFORMATION OBTAINED TO DATE INDICATES THAT TAGETITOXIN IS MUCH DIFFERENT THAN THE KNOWN ANTIBIOTICS THAT ARE RNA POLYMERASE INHIBITORS. THE GOALS OF PHASE I RESEARCH ARE: (1) TO INVESTIGATE MEDIA AND FERMENTATION PARAMETERS THAT WILL ALLOW EFFICIENT AND CONSISTENT GROWTH OF THE TOXIN-PRODUCING BACTERIUM, ALONG WITH PRODUCTION OF REPRODUCIBLY HIGH LEVELS OF TAGETITOXIN; (2) TO SCALE UP AND IMPROVE PURIFICATION METHODS; AND (3) TO DETERMINE THE EXACT STRUCTURE OF TAGETITOXIN BY USING INSTRUMENTAL, CHEMICAL, AND ENZYMATIC METHODS. THE STRUCTURAL KNOWLEDGE OBTAINED IN PHASE I WILL BE USED IN PHASE II TO SYNTHESIZE AND EVALUATE NEW TAGETITOXIN ANALOGS FOR BACTERIAL PERMEABILITY, RNA POLYMERASE INHIBITORY ACTIVITY, ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY, AND STRUCTURE/ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIPS, WITH THE ULTIMATE AIM OF DEVELOPING TAGETITOXIN OR ITS DERIVATIVES INTO A NEW FAMILY OF ANTIMICROBIAL PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN AND/OR VETERINARY MEDICINE.",

HOWEVER, NONE OF THOSE POLYMERS HAVE GOOD PROCESSABILITIES WHICH WILL BE REQUIRED IN COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS. PERFLUORINATED POLYMERS HAVE SUCH LOW MOLECULAR INTERACTIONS THAT THEY DO NOT STICK TOGETHER VERY WELL LIKE MOST HYDROCARBON AND PARTIALLY FLUORINATED POLYMERS DO. THE LACK OF REACTIVE SITES IN THOSE PERFLUOROPOLYETHER ELASTOMERS MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO CHEMICALLY CROSS-LINK THE POLYMERS. EFFORTS WILL BE MADE TO SOLVE THE ABOVE PROCESSABILITY PROBLEMS BY INTRODUCING SOME FUNCTIONALITY INTO PERFLUOROPOLYETHER ELASTOMERS USING RECENTLY DEVELOPED FLUORINATION TECHNIQUES.

CLINICAL INVESTIGATIONS HAVE ESTABLISHED THAT PERIODIC ASSESSMENT OF THE PREVAILING BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVEL IS ESSENTIAL TO ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING CONTROL OF DIABETES. THE MAINSTAY OF MONITORING DIABETIC CONTROL IS MEASUREMENT OF THE BLOOD GLUCOSE CONCENTRATION AND OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH CERTAIN CIRCULATING PROTEINS HAVE BECOME NONENZYMATICALLY GLYCATED. HEMOGLOBIN A1C AND GLYCOHEMOGLOBIN MEASUREMENTS ARE WIDELY USED AS A MEANS TO OBJECTIVELY EVALUATE AMBIENT GLUCOSE CONTROL OVER 2- TO 3-MONTH PERIODS. HOWEVER, CURRENT METHODS FOR THEIR MEASUREMENT ARE TIME CONSUMING, CUMBERSOME, NONSPECIFIC, AND HAVE UNACCEPTABLE COEFFICIENTS OF VARIATION. THESE PROBLEMS COULD BE SURMOUNTED IF A MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY THAT REACTS ONLY WITH HEMOGLOBIN A1C WERE AVAILABLE. THIS PROJECT WILL USE A UNIQUE AND HIGHLY SPECIFIC MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY THAT RECOGNIZES THE N-TERMINAL GLYCATED EPITOPES RESIDING IN HEMOGLOBIN A1C BUT NOT IN OTHER PROTEINS AND THAT DOES NOT REACT WITH (UNGLYCATED) HEMOGLOBIN A DEGREE TO DEVELOP A RELIABLE AND SPECIFIC IMMUNODIAGNOSTIC METHOD TO QUANTITATE HEMOGLOBIN A1C IN HUMAN BLOOD.",

CURRENT METHODS TO INCREASE OXYGEN TRANSFER TO STREPTOMYCES INCLUDE IMPROVED BIOREACTOR DESIGN AND MODIFIED CULTURE MEDIA. A NOVEL APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM OF OXYGEN TRANSFER IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF STRAINS THAT CAN OBTAIN OXYGEN FROM THE MEDIUM MORE EFFICIENTLY. THE CURRENTPROPOSAL IS DIRECTED TOWARDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A GENETICALLY MODIFIED STRAIN THAT EXPRESSES A BACTERIAL HEMOGLOBIN-LIKE PROTEIN. THIS PROTEIN WAS ORIGINALLY DISCOVERED IN THE AEROBIC BACTERIA VITREOSCILLA, AND APPARENTLY ENABLES THE CELLS TO SURVIVE IN AN OXYGEN-POOR ENVIRONMENT. WHEN VITREOSCILLA HEMOGLOBIN WAS EXPRESSED IN THE BACTERIA ESCHERICHIA COLI, THE RECOMBINANT CELLS DEMONSTRATED HIGHER GROWTH AND RESPIRATION RATES, AND GREW TO HIGHER CELL DENSITIES. THE GENE ENCODING THIS PROTEIN WILL BE INTRODUCED INTO STREPTOMYCES COELICOLOR, WHICH PRODUCES THE ANTIBIOTIC ACTINORHODIN. THE RECOMBINANT CELLSWILL THEN BE TESTED FOR THEIR GROWTH AND RESPIRATORY PROPERTIES, AND ACTINORHODIN PRODUCTION. THE DEMONSTRATION OF ENHANCED GROWTH, RESPIRATION, AND/OR ACTINORHODIN YIELDS IN THIS SYSTEM WILL HAVE BROAD IMPLICATIONS NOT ONLY FOR ANTIBIOTIC FERMENTATIONS BUT FOR ANY BIOPROCESS SYSTEM THAT INVOLVES AEROBIC CELL CULTURE.",

THE TRI-TAC SYSTEM DEVELOPED IN THE 1970'S IS NOW BEING FIELDED. AT THE SAME TIME THERE IS INCREASING EMPHASIS WITHIN THE AIR FORCE ON THE UTILIZATION OF COTS EQUIPMENT, AND PROLIFERATION OF COTS BASED WORKSTATION/PC EQUIPMENT. THE TRI-TAC STANDARD DIGITAL INTERFACE IS BASED ON A CONDITIONED DIPHASE TRI-TAC STANDARD WHICH IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH STANDARD COMMERCIAL DIGITAL INTERFACES. THE INTERFACE OPTIONS FOR COTS WORKSTATION/PCS, TERMINALS AND ADP EQUIPMENT HAS BEEN LIMITED TO THE USE OF VOICE TERMINAL DATA PORTS OR LIMITED DIGITAL MULTIPLEX PORTS, WITH LIMITED FLEXIBILITY AND COST IMPACTS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH PROGRAM WILL DEVELOP AN EMBEDDED TRI-TAC CDI INTERFACE FOR AIR FORCE STANDARD WORKSTATIONS/PCS WHICH WILL ALLOW DIRECT CONNECTION THROUGH THE TRI-TAC COMMUNICATIONS RESOURCES. THE PHASE I EFFORT WILL DEVELOP BASELINE PROTOTYPE DESIGN AND INVESTIGATE REQUIREMENTS FOR FUTURE EVOLUTIONARY ENHANCEMENTS TO THE BASELINE DEVICE IN THE AREAS OF SIGNALLING.

AT PRESENT, THE RECOMMENDED METHOD FOR MEASURING PARTICLE FALLOUT CONTAMINATION IS THE WITNESS PLATE WHICH INTEGRATES THE PARTICLE FALLOUT OVER SEVERAL DAYS. THE PARTICLES AND FIBERS COLLECTED ON THE FILTERS ARE SIZED AND MANUALLY COUNTED USING OPTICAL MICROSCOPY TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF PARTICLES-FIBERS PER SQUARE FOOT PER 24 HOURS. THIS METHOD IS TEDIOUS, TIME CONSUMING, AND PROVIDES ONLY INTEGRATED DISTRIBUTIONS WITHOUT THE FINE STRUCTURE OF INDIVIDUAL EVENTS. IT WOULD BE OF GREAT ADVANTAGE IF PARTICLE FALLOUT COULD BE MEASURED IN REAL TIME SO THAT SOURCES OF CONTAMINATION COULD BE IDENTIFIED AND REMOVED IN A TIMELY FASHION. IN THIS SOLICITATION WE PROPOSE AN ADVANCED AND INNOVATIVE APPROACH FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF PARTICLE FALLOUT CONTAMINATION IN REAL TIME, THE ELUTRIATOR QUARTZ CRYSTAL MICROBALANCE (EQCM). THIS INSTRUMENT WILL SEPARATE AIRBORNE PARTICLES ACCORDING TO SPECIFIC AND SELECTABLE CUT-OFF SIZES, COLLECT AND WEIGH THE PARTICLES IN REAL TIME ON A SENSITIVE MICROBALANCE, AND RETAINS THE COLLECTED PARTICLES FOR POST ANALYSIS BY OPTICAL OR ELECTRONMICROSCOPY.

        "abstract": "Abstract         SINCE THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY, IT HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED THAT MEDICAL RADIOGRAPHICS ARE DEGRADED BY THE EFFECTS OF SCATTER. BEGINNING WITH THE INITIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE BUCKY GRID AND CONTINUING THROUGH MANY IMPROVEMENTS AND ALTERNATIVES, ATTEMPTS TO CONTROL THE AMOUNT OF SCATTER WHILE MAXIMIZING THE TRANSMISSION OF UNSCATTERED PRIMARY RADIATION HAVE ACHIEVED ONLY MODERATE SUCCESS. IN CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART IMAGING SYSTEMS, SCATTER LEVELS EXCEED PRIMARY RADIATION LEVELS WHEN THICK BODY PARTS ARE EXAMINED. AS A RESULT, LESS THAN 50 PERCENT OF THE POSSIBLE CONTRAST IS IMAGED. THE SCANNING GRID SYSTEM PROPOSED CAN VIRTUALLY ELIMINATE SCATTER WHEN THICK BODY PARTS ARE IMAGED AND CAN BE USED IN A WIDE VARIETY OF CLINICAL EXAMINATIONS TYPICALLY DONE WITH A BUCKY TABLE UNIT. IN ADDITION, THE SYSTEM WILL PERMIT ANGULATED VIEWS AND IS COMPATIBLE WITH LINEAR TOMOGRAPHY AND LARGE-AREA DIGITAL IMAGE RECEPTORS. EARLIER INVESTIGATIONS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT A SCANNING GRID CAN OFFER SIGNIFICANT SCATTER-CONTROL ADVANTAGES. TO MAKE THIS A PRACTICAL DEVICE, TECHNIQUES WILL BE INVESTIGATED TO DEVELOP A MORE EFFICIENT SCANNING GRID THAT COULD BE MANUFACTURED RELIABLY AND COST EFFECTIVELY AS WELL AS A NOVEL AUTOMATIC X-RAY EXPOSURE CONTROL DEVICE SO THAT THE SYSTEM WILL PROVIDE CONSISTENT, HIGH-QUALITY, SCATTER-FREE RADIOGRAPHICS.",

THE TRANSFER OF MOMENTUM AND ENERGY FROMTHESE \"FLUID PADDLES\" TO THE FLOW TO BE INDUCED WILL TAKE PLACE IN GOOD PART THROUGH THE WORK OF THE PRESSURE FORCES THAT THE TWO FLOWS EXERT ON ONE ANOTHER AT THEIR MOVING INTERFACES.

ATM IS A NEW TELECOMMUNICATIONS STANDARD THAT IS THE BASIS FOR THE FORTHCOMING WORLDWIDE BROADBAND INTEGRATED SERVICES DIGITAL NETWORK (B-ISDN). THE ATM STANDARDF IS ALSO ATTRACTIVE FOR LOCAL-AREA NETWORKS BECAUSE IT IS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT HIGH-SPEED MULTI-MEDIA COMMUNICATION (SIMULTANEOUS DATA, AUDIO, AND VIDEO COMMUNICATION) OVER THE SAME NETWORK. FORE SYSTEMS' PROPOSED NETWORK ARCHITECTURE WILL USE HIGH-SPEED (622 MBITS/SEC) FIBER-OPTIC LINKS CONNECTED TO FAST PACKET SWITCHES THAT CAN HANDLE THE SMALL PACKETS, OR CELLS, SPECIFIED BY THE ATM STANDARD. IN ORDER TO CONNECT COMPUTERS TO THE NETWORK, FORE SYSTEMS PROPOSES TO DEVELOP 622 MBITS/SEC ATM INTERFACES FOR HIGH-END WORKSTATIONS. BOTH THE COMPUTER AND SWITCH INTERFACES WILL BE BUILT AROUND A SINGLE ASIC CHIP THAT WILL HANDLE ATM CELL PROCESSING, LEADING TO A HIGHLY-INTEGRATED, COST-EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION. DURING THE PHASE I, FORE SYSTEMS WILL STUDY THE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE AND ESTABLISH ITS FEASIBILITY. IN PARTICULAR, THE RESULTS OF THE PHASE I STUDY WILL INCLUDE HIGH-LEVEL DESIGNS AND COST ESTIMATES OF THE HARDWARE COMPONENTS, SPECIFICATION OF SYSTEMS SOFTWARE, AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS.

        "abstract": "Abstract         COOLING OF ELECTRONICS IS A CRITICAL FACTOR IN THE DESIGN OF NAVAL AVIONICS, ESPECIALLY IN INTEGRATED RACK ELECTRONICS. PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THERMAL MISMATCH BETWEEN FRAME (USUALLY ALUMINUM) AND BOARD (OFTEN CERAMIC) REQUIRE THE USE OF THICK DHESIVE BONDS WHICH INTRODUCES HIGH THERMAL RESISTANCE IN THE PATH OF THE HEAT FLOW. FOSTER-MILLER PROPOSES A NOVEL APPROACH TO CREATING A HIGH THERMAL DISSIPATION, HIGHLY RELIABLE INTEGRAL CIRCUIT PANEL/FRAME/ HEAT SINK. THE APPROACH COMBINES FOUR NEWLY EMERGED TECHNOLOGIES: 1. GROWTH OF CVD DIAMOND FILMS; 2. ACTIVE ALLOY BRAZING OF DIAMOND; 3. METAL MATRIX COMPOSITES WITH TAILORED PROPERTIES; 4. MULTICHIP THIN-FILM PACKAGING. IN PHASE I, CVD DIAMOND THIN FILMS WILL BE DEPOSITED ONTO A SILICON WAFER PRIOR TO DOPING. THE DIAMOND FILM PROVIDES BOTH ELECTRICAL ISOLATION AND EXCELLENT HEAT TRANSFER. COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE, CROSSPLIED (0/90) GR/AL COMPOSITES WITH TAILORED PROPERTIES HAVE BEEN SELECTED AS FRAME MATERIAL. THE DIAMOND-COTED SILICON WILL BE JOINED TO THE GR/AL WITH AN INNOVATIVE TWO-COMPONENT BRAZING ALLOY FORMULATED TO WET AND STRONGLY BOND TO DIAMOND. THE HEAT TRANSFER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CHIP-FRAME-HEAT SINK CONSTRUCTION WILL BE DETERMINED, AS WELL AS ITS MECHANICAL INTEGRITY BY MICROSCOPIC AND HOLOGRAPHIC NDT.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         THIS PROJECT IS AN EXPLORATION OF THE APPLICATION OF KNOWLEDGE BASED TOOLS TO SCALABLE MILITARY CAMPAIGN SIMULATIONS. THE APPROACH TO BE TAKEN IS TO DEVELOP A GENERALIZED FRAME BASED KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION SYSTEM WITH A COMBINATION OF ACTIVE AND STATIC SLOT VALUES TO REPRESENT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF EACH LEVEL OF THE FORCE HIERARCHY. ACTIVE VALUES IN THE SYSTEM MAY CONSIST OF DATA BASE QUERIES, PROCEDURAL (DETERMINISTIC) PROGRAM CALLS, OR NON-PROCEDURAL (INFERENCE ENGINE) CALLS. AGGREGATION IS ACCOMODATED THROUGH ALGORITHMS CALLED BY THE ACTIVE VALUE SLOTS OF THE FRAME. OPPOSING FORCE ACTIVITIES ARE SIMILARLY SIMULATED FOR PLAY AGAINST THE COMPUTER. PROGRAMMING A SIMULATION IS TABLE DRIVEN AND WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY CHANGING THE SLOT VALUES IN THE CONTROLLING FRAME(S) OF THE INSTANTIATION. SYSTEM PERFORMANCE IS BROUGHT TO FASTER THAN REAL TIME BY USING A MODIFICATION OF A PROPRIETARY, SCALABLE, DISTRIBUTED, PARALLEL-PROCESSING SYSTEM RUNNING ON A NETWORK OF PERSONAL COMPUTERS. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - THE KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION SCHEME TO BE DEVELOPED SHOULD BE OF VALUE FOR ANY HIERARCHICALLY ORIENTED SIMULATION (ESPECIALLY FOR MILITARY, BUSINESS, OR GOVERNMENTAL UNIT INTERACTIONS). THE MODIFIED PARALLEL PROCESSING SYSTEM WILL MAKE POSSIBLE MUCH CHEAPER AND MORE ROBUST SCALABLE, FAULT-TOLERANT COMPUTING SYSEMS. KEY WORDS - KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION, KNOWLEDGE BASED TOOLS, PARALLEL PROCESSING SYSTEM, FORCE HIERARCHY",

IMMEDIATE APPLICATION IS TO NASA'S STS OPERATIONSALTHOUGH MANY OTHER APPLICATIONS CAN BE IDENTIFIED. TECHNIQUES FOR MEASURING STS LAUNCH WINDS CLOSE TO THE SCHEDULED LAUNCH TIME AND LAUNCH PATH WOULD REDUCE THE UNCERTAINITY MARGIN OF CALCULATED WIND LOADS, INCREASE LAUNCH PROBABILITY (7-8%), AND DECREASE THE RISK OF LAUNCHING UNDER ADVERSE WIND CONDITIONS. SHUTTLE PRELAUNCH WINDS ARE TYPICALLY MEASURED WITH SLOW RISING JIMSPHERE BALLOONS RELEASED SOME 3.5 HOURS BEFORE LAUNCH, WHICH CAN DRIFT 10 MILES ON A DAY OF STRONG WINDS. RECENTLY, NASA HAS SHOWN THAT WINDS OF EQUAL ACCURACY AND RESOLUTION AS THOSE OBTAINED BY A JIMSPHERE CAN BE OBTAINED WITH AN INSTRUMENTED AIRCRAFT IN APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES. HOWEVER, THE INITIAL CAPITAL INVESTMENT FOR A DEDICATED AIRCRAFT AND ITS OPERATION COSTS ARE LARGE. ALSO, IT IS CURRENTLY NECESSARY TO MEASURE THE AIRCRAFT GROUND SPEED WITH A RADAR BECAUSE THE INS ACCURACY IS INSUFFICIENT. A SMALL INSTRUMENTED ROCKET CAN BE DIRECTED SPECIFICALLY ALONG THE SHUTTLE LAUNCH PATH AND TELEMETRY WINDSPEEDS WELL WITHIN THE 10 MINUTE TIME FRAME. ITS SHORT FLIGHT DURATION AND STRAIGHT-LINE TRAJECTORY ALLOWS GROUND SPEEDS TO BE MEASURED ACCURATELY WITH AN INS.

HOWEVER, RAW I/O AND SEEK RATES OF DISKS HAVE IMPROVED FAR LESS, AND THE BASIC ARCHITECTURE OF KERNAL FILE SYSTEMS (THE LEVEL CONCERNED WITH THE STRUCTURE AND ORGANIZATION OF THE DISK BLOCKS MAKING UP EACH FILE) HAS REMAINED ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED. THE RESULT IS THAT TODAY'S HIGH PERFORMANCE SYSTEMS ARE OFTEN SEVERELY LIMITED BY FILE SYSTEM THROUGHPUT. THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO INVESTIGATE A NEW KERNEL FILE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE CALLED LAFS, WHICH THROUGH THE USE OF A NEW ADDRESSING PARADIGM, OFFERS HIGHER AND SCALABLE PERFORMANCE, HIGHER RELIABILITY, AND GREATER EASE OF USE THAN OFFERED IN CURRENT DESIGNS. IMPROVEMENTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR BOTH MULTI THREADED DIVERSE LOADS (E.G. FILE SERVERS, TIMESHARING, DBMS) AND FOR SINGLE STREAM APPLICATIONS (E.G. COMPUTATION INTENSIVE ANALYSIS, GRAPHICS). PHASE I WILL RESULT IN A FUNCTIONAL EMULATION OF THIS SYSTEM OPERATING ON A SINGLE DRIVE HOSTED IN A CONVENTIONAL WORKSTATION. PERFORMANCE UNDER VARIOUS LOADS WILL BE COMPARED TO THE STANDARD SYSTEM. THESE RESULTS AND THE HOST SYSTEM SW AND INTERFACES DEVELOPED WILL BE DIRECTLYUSED IN PHASE II/III FOR A FULL SCALE PROTOTYPE.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE NATURE OF EW/C3CM CALCULATIONS LENDS ITSELF TO A PARALLEL PROCESSING APPROACH FOR REAL-TIME COMPUTATIONS. EFFECTIVE PARALLEL PROCESSING, HOWEVER, INTRODUCES ADDITIONAL COMPLEXITIES OF LOAD LEVELING BETWEEN PROCESSING RESOURCES, PROCESSOR CONTROL AND SYNCHRONIZATION, AND MANAGEMENT OF THE \"AREA OF FOCUS\" SUCH THAT THE SIMULATION PERFORMED IS DYNAMICALLY SCALABLE IN THE LEVEL OF DETAIL CONSIDERED AND COORDINATED TO PROVIDE REAL-TIME RESPONSE. IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE ADVANCE A METHODOLOGY AND ARCHITECTURE FOR HIGHLY EFFICIENT REAL-TIME PARALLEL PROCESSING WHICH EXPLOITS THE SPACIAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE ITEMS BEING SUMULATED. PROCESSING ELEMENTS OF A PARALLEL ENVIRONMENT ARE ASSIGNED 3-DIMENSIONAL GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY. \"LOAD BALANCING\" IS ACCOMPLISHED BY MODIFYING EACH NODES GEOGRAPHIC AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY. UNIQUELY THE MANAGEMENT OF THE NODE ASSIGNED AREAS IS DE-CENTRALIZED, THE LOCAL NODE DETERMINING CONJESTION AND NEGOTIATING AREA TRANSACTIONS WITH ITS NEIGHBORING NODES. THIS ROBUST DE-CENTRALIZED LOAD-BALANCING IN TURN ALLOWS THE SIMULATION FIDELITY TO BE CONTROLLED DYNAMICALLY AT THE OBJECT LEVEL WHILE MAINTAINING REAL-TIME RESPONSE. THE PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE FREE FROM BUS OR SHARED MEMORY LIMITATIONS IS IMPLEMENTABLE TO CURRENT TRANSPUTER TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE COST EFFECTIVE MASSIVELY-PARALLEL REAL-TIME SIMULATION. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - THE PROPOSED METHODOLOGY WILL VASTLY EXTEND THE DEGREE OF PARALLELISM PRACTICALLY ACHIEVABLE BY LARGE-SCALE SIMULATION AND CERTAIN CLASSES OF MATHEMATICAL MODELING INCLUDING FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS. THE ALGOITHMS ADVANCED MAINTAIN REAL-TIME RESPONSE THROUGH A COMBINATION OF ROBUST LOAD-BALANCING ACCOMODATING TRANSIENT IN PROCESSING NODE LOADING.

BECAUSE OF THE HIGH DENSITIES AND HIGH STRAIN ENERGIES CHARACTERISTIC OF SMALL CAGE MOLECULES, POLYNITRO CAGE COMPOUNDS ARE PRIME CANDIDATES FOR NEW POWERFUL EXPLOSIVES. PARTICULARLY INTERESTING ARE COMPOUNDS CONTAINING GEMINAL DINITRO GROUPS WHICH HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE QUITE INSENSITIVE. A NUMBER OF POLYNITRO CAGE COMPOUNDS INCLUDING BOTH C-NITRO AND N-NITRO COMPOUNDS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS POTENTIAL NEW, INSENSITIVE, HIGH EXPLOSIVES. COMPOUNDS BASED ON THE ADAMANTANE, SECOCUBANE AND DIASTERANE SKELETONS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED FOR FURTHER STUDY. CALCULATIONS TO DETERMINE DENSITIES, HEATS OF FORMATION, AND DETONATION VELOCITY AND PRESSURE WILL BE CARRIED OUT ON THESE COMPOUNDS TO EVALUATE WHICH OF THE MATERIALS SHOULD BE PURSUED IN A SYNTHETIC PROGRAM. SYNTHETIC ROUTES FOR THE MOST LIKELY CANDIDATES WILL BE DEVELOPED AND KEY SYNTHETIC STEPS WILL BE PERFORMED ON THE ACTUAL MOLECULES OR ON MODEL SYSTEMS IN THE PHASE I EFFORT. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - DATA OBTAINED FROM THIS RESEARCH EFFORT WILL BE USED AS A GUIDE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW ENERGETIC MATERIALS WHICH ARE BOTH POWERFUL AND INSENSITIVE. THESE MATERIALS WILL FIND APPLICATION IN BOTH EXPLOSIVES AND PROPELLANTS WHICH WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS OF NEW CONVENTIONAL WEAPON SYSTEMS. THE NEW CAGE COMPOUNDS DEVELOPED IN THIS PROGRAM WILL ALSO HAVE APPLICATION IN OTHER AREAS OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY, PARTICULARLY IN PHARMACEUTICALS. KEY WORDS - HIGH DENSITY, POLYNITROPOLYCYCLES, NITRAMINES, ADAMANTANES, INSENSITIVE, GEMINAL DINITRO, SECOCUBANES, DIASTERANES",

DEVELOPING THIN FILM TRANSISTORS (TFT) WHICH CAN BE FABRICATED ON THE SAME SUBSTRATE OF A-SI THIN FILM PARTICLE DETECTORS WOULD PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES FOR LARGE SCALE APPLICATIONS SUCH AS FOR THE SUPERCONDUCTING SUPER COLLIDER. BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE WITH A-SI PARTICLE DETECTORS AND A-SI TFT DEVELOPMENT, AN INITIAL STUDY FOR EXPLORING THE TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING A-SI AND POLY-CRYSTALLINE SI (POLY-SI) TFTS FOR A-SI PARTICLE DETECTION DEVICES IS PROPOSED. THE TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY, POTENTIALS, AND LIMITATIONS OF USING A-SI AND POLY-SI TFT TECHNOLOGY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF A-SI PARTICLE DETECTORS WILL BE EXPLORED THROUGH MATERIAL AND DEVICE DESIGN, FABRICATION, OPTIMIZATION, AND TESTING. IN THIS STUDY, HIGHTEMPERATURE ANNEALING AND LASER ANNEALING WILL BE EXPLORED FOR TRANSFORMATION OF A-SI INTO HIGH QUALITY POLY-SI FOR REACHING MUCH HIGHER ELECTRON AND HOLE MOBILITIES WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL FOR HIGH SPEED TFT DEVICES.",

ADVANCES IN MATERIALS, DESIGN, AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURE HAVE PRODUCED A NEW GENERATION OF PLASTIC HEAT EXCHANGERS WHICH APPROACH OR EQUAL THE PERFORMANCE LEVEL OF EXISTING METAL TYPES. SEVERAL RECENT PATENT CASES HAVE BEEN FILED ON THESE SYSTEMS. THESE HEAT EXCHANGERS NOT ONLY BENEFIT FROM THE OBVIOUS WEIGHT ADVANTAGE BUT ALSO, ENGINEERED PLASTICS THAT ARE UTILIZED IN THEIR CONSTRUCTION EXHIBIT EXCELLENT COMPATIBILITY IN ENVIRONMENTS CONTAINING GLYCOLS, HYDROCARBONS, AND OTHER CORROSIVE OR DEGRADING COMPOUNDS. PLASTIC HEAT EXCHANGERS HAVE BEEN USED IN THE INDUSTRY FOR MANY YEARS NOW WITH A GREAT DEAL OF SUCCESS IN THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY, WHERE LIGHTWEIGHT, NON CORRODING HEAT EXCHANGERS ARE A REQUIREMENT. THESE TYPES OF EXCHANGERS HAVE BEEN TYPICALLY THE LIQUID TO LIQUID SHELL AND TUBE TYPE, AND WERE NOT SUITABLE FOR LIQUID TO AIR EXCHANGE. ALTHOUGH LIQUID TO AIR EXCHANGERS AND AIR TO AIR EXCHANGERS (CONSTRUCTED OF PLASTIC) DO EXIST, THEIR PERFORMANCE CAPABILITIES HAVE BEEN LIMITED DUE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CAPABILITY AND HEAT REJECTION CAPABILITY. THE NEW TYPE OF AMPHIBIOUS HEAT EXCHANGER DEVELOPED BY OUR GROUP MAY OFFER STRONG POTENTIAL IN THE AREA OF AMPHIBIOUS VEHICLES. THIS EXCHANGER SYSTEM EXHIBITS AN INCREASE IN HEAT REJECTION OF APPROXIMATELY 3 - 4 TIMES WHEN USED IN A WATER TO WATER APPLICATION OVER IT'S LIQUID TO AIR APPLICATION. GIVEN THE ADVERTISED HORSEPOWER AND HEAT REJECTION REQUIREMENTS OF THE PRIME MOVER PROPOSED IT IS FELT THAT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INTO THE APPLICATION OF THIS HEAT EXCHANGER SYSTEM WARRANTS INVESTIGATION.",

THE TECHNICAL APPROACH WILL EMPLOY THE PRESSURE-SENSING, DENSITY-SENSING, AND SOUND-SENSING TECHNIQUES, WITH MICROPROCESSOR CLOSED-LOOP FEEDBACK. THREE SIGNIFICANT SYMPTOMS-THE OCCURRENCE OF THE RECANALIZATION SOUND, THE DROP IN INTERCOLON PRESSURE, AND THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ABDOMINAL MASS-DETECTED BY THIS NOVEL INSTRUMENT WILL BE USED TO INDICATE THE SUCCESS OF THE TREATMENT. THE SUCCESS OF THIS WORK WILL PROVIDE PEDIATRICIANS WITH A UNIQUE MEANS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF INTUSSUSCEPTION IN INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN. THE NEW METHOD IS NONINVASIVE AND NONFLUOROSCOPIC. IT AVOIDS THE HARMFUL X-RAY RADIATION AND ELIMINATES THE CHANCE OF FATAL ACCIDENTS SUCH AS COLONICPERFORATIONS; THUS, IT IS EXTREMELY SAFE IN COMPARISON WITH THE PREVIOUS METHODS. THE OTHER ADVANTAGES OF THE NEW TECHNIQUE INCLUDE SIMPLER OPERATION, SUBSTANTIALLY SHORTER RECOVERY TIME, NO COMPLICATIONS, NO ANESTHESIA REQUIRED, AND LOW COST.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         ADDRESSING THE NEED FOR LIGHT-WEIGHT CORROSION RESISTANT MATERIALS FOR EMI SHIELDING, THE NOVEL TECHNOLOGY PROPOSED HEREIN UTILIZES SOLUBLE CONDUCTING (SEMICONDUCTING) POLYMERS DEVELOPED IN GUMB'S LABORATORIES FOR UNRELATED APPLICATIONS. THESE POLYMERS HAVE 6% W/W OR HIGHER SOLUBILITY IN ORGANIC SOLVENTS AND BULK CONDUCTIVITIES AS HIGH AS 2,000 S/CM (DATA PRESENTED HEREIN). STABILITY, DURABILITY (INCLUDING WATER-REPELLENCY) AND NON-CORROSIVE NATURE OF THE POLYMERS ARE ALREADY PROVEN. SINCE EXTENSIVE WORK IN OTHER LABS HAS SHOWN THAT EMI SHIELDING EFFECTIVENESS (SE) IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO CONDUCTIVITY AND 1 S/CM CONDUCTIVITY MATERIALS CAN PROVIDE 30 DB OR MORE OF SE IN THE 1 - 100 MHZ RANGE, THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY WILL EASILY MEET THE TARGETED 60 DB SE. THE PROPOSED WORK SEEKS FIRSTLY TO TEST ALREADY SYNTHESIZED SOLUBLE POLYMERS AS THE MATRIX COMPONENT IN COMPOSITES WITH FILLERS SUCH AS GRAPHITE CLOTH, GRAPHITE FIBER, CARBON BLACK OR METAL-COATED GLASS FIBER, FOR EMI SE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASTM ES 7-83, MIL-STD-462 AND RELATED SPECIFICATIONS AT 10 KHZ - 1 GHZ IN NEAR AND FAR FIELD ESTIMATIONS. THE POLYMER'S SOLUBILITY RENDERS COMPOSITE FABRICATION FACILE. THE WORK WILL ALSO SEEK TO IMPROVE CONDUCTIVITY, SOLUBILITY AND STABILITY OF THE POLYMERS FURTHER, AND SELECTED ADDITIONAL NOVEL POLYMERS WILL BE SYNTHESIZED. ADVANTAGES OF THE TECHNOLOGY INCLUDE LIGHT WEIGHT, NON-CORROSIVENESS, LOW COST, HIGH AND CONTROLLABLE CONDUCTIVITY, AND FABRICATION INTO COMPLEX SHAPES.",

HOWEVER, TWO KEY FUNCTIONS HAVE BEEN MISSING, NAMELY FREQUENCY FILTERS AND FREQUENCY SETTING ELEMENTS (FOR OSCILLATORS). CURRENT MMIC RESEARCH AS STILL RELIED ON OLDER (NON-MONOLITHIC) TECHNOLOGIES FOR PROVIDING THESE TWO CRITICAL FUNCTIONS WHICH ARE NECESSARY FOR COMPLETE MMIC SUBSYSTEMS. IF A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN RF AND MICROWAVE SUBSYSTEM SIZE IS TO OCCUR AS A RESULT OF THE MMIC EFFORT, A MAJOR ADVANCE MUST BE MADE TO ACHIEVE MONOLITHIC IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE TWO CRITICAL FUNCTIONS. FOR FREQUENCIES BELOW 1 GHZ, SURFACE ACOUSTIC WAVE (SAW) AND BULK ACOUSTIC WAVE (BAW) TECHNOLOGIES HAVE PROVIDED EXCELLENT MONOLITHIC IMPLEMENTATIONS OF THESE TWO FUNCTIONS. THE PROPOSED PROGRAM WILL EXTEND THE FREQUENCY RANGE OF THESE ACOUSTIC TECHNOLOGIES BY A FACTOR OF 10 THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INNOVATIVE NEW CLASS OF ACOUSTIC PROPAGATION MODES WHICH HAVE PHASE VELOCITIES THAT ARE UP TO 10 TIMES LARGER THAN CONVENTIONAL ACOUSTIC WAVE VELOCITIES.

LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HTLV-II PREVALENCE IN THE POPULATION OR ITS DISEASE ASSOCIATIONS BECAUSE THE STUDY OF HTLV-II HAS LAGGED, IN PART DUE TO THE LACK OF READILY AVAILABLE, REASONABLY PRICED ASSAY REAGENTS. THIS PROJECT WILL CONSTRUCT RECOMBINANT CLONES OF THE HTLV-II PROTEINS IN AN EXPRESSION VECTOR BY POLYMERASE CHAINREACTION AMPLIFICATION AND ASSESS THE UTILITY OF THE RECOMBINANT PRODUCT AS SEROLOGIC REAGENTS FOR LARGE-SCALE PRODUCTION AND PURIFICATION. PHASE I OBJECTIVES INCLUDE CONSTRUCTION OF TWO CLONES OF THE HTLV-II ENVELOPE (ENV) GENE IN AN E. COLI EXPRESSION VECTOR AND PRELIMINARY CHARACTERIZATION OF THE EXPRESSED VIRAL PRODUCTS. IN PHASE II, ENV WILL BE CLONED INTO ADDITIONAL EXPRESSION SYSTEMS, AND THE MERITS OF THE DIFFERENT VECTORS WITH REGARDTO VIRAL PROTEIN PRODUCTION, ANTIGENICITY, AND SOLUBILITY WILL BE COMPARED. OTHER PHASE II OBJECTIVES INCLUDE CLONING OF THE BALANCE OF THE HTLV-II ANTIGENS AND DEVELOPMENT OF A PRELIMINARY PURIFICATION STRATEGY. RECOMBINANT VIRAL PROTEINS PRODUCED IN QUANTITY HAVING GOOD SOLUBILITY AND SEROLOGIC REACTIVITY CHARACTERISTICS ARE GOODCANDIDATES FOR RESEARCH AND BLOOD SCREENING ASSAY REAGENTS.",

HOWEVER, ADVANCES IN BOTH DATA ACQUISITION HARDWARE AND DATA PROCESSING ARE REQUIRED BEFORE HIGH RESOLUTION IMAGES ARE PRACTICAL BETWEEN OIL WELL BOREHOLES SEPARATED SEVERAL THOUSAND FEET. THIS PROJECT INVOLVES THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF AN INNOVATIVE FLUID-COUPLED SEISMIC SOURCE DESIGN WHICH OVERCOMES MANY OF THE DISADVANTAGES OF EXISTING PIEZOELECTRIC SEISMIC SOURCES. THE NEW SOURCE HAS A LOWER OPERATING FREQUENCY CAPABILITY APPROACHING 50 HZ, IS EFFICIENT, IS MORE SUITABLE FOR BOREHOLE APPLICATIONS, AND IS EXPECTED TO OPERATE AT BOREHOLE TEMPERATURES APPROACHING 200 DEGREES CENTIGRADE. PHASE I OF THE PROJECT WILL PROVE THE FEASIBILITY OF THE BOREHOLE PIEZOELECTRIC SEISMIC SOURCE THROUGH A LABORATORY AND FIELD STUDY AIMED AT DEFINING THE PIEZOELECTRIC SOURCE TRANSDUCER PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS THROUGH FREE FIELD ACOUSTIC AND BOREHOLE-TO-BOREHOLE SEISMIC MEASUREMENTS. OF SPECIFIC INTEREST ARE THE SOURCE TRANSMISSION PROPERTIES SUCH AS: (1) USABLE BANDWIDTH, (2) SOURCE BEHAVIOR OVER THIS BAND, AND (3) THE PILOT WAVEFORM TO BE UTILIZED IN CORRELATION OF THE SOURCE. THIS BOREHOLE PIEZOELECTRIC SOURCE WILL BE CHARACTERIZED FOR EFFICIENT HIGH DUTY-CYCLE SWEEP EXCITATIONS. ITS PILOT SIGNAL CHARACTERISTICS WILL BE SUITABLY DEFINED SO THAT IT CAN BE PROPERLY CORRELATED TO PRODUCE A HIGH QUALITY KLAUDER WAVELET.",

ADVANCES IN NMR MICROSCOPY AND MR IMAGING OF SOLIDS DEMAND INCREASED FIELD STRENGTH FOR IMPROVEMENT OF THE SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO AND, HENCE, INCREASED SENSITIVITY. DESIGN OF A SUPERCONDUCTING NB3SN INSERT FOR AN EXISTING NBTI OUTER MAGNET USING A NEW JOINTING TECHNIQUE WILL ENABLEA STABLE SHORT MAGNET TO EVOLVE. FOLLOWING FEASIBILITY STUDIES OF THE NEW JOINTING TECHNIQUE, THE PHASE II GOAL IS TO PRODUCE A 600-MHZ, 1-H-FREQUENCY MAGNET BASED ON A FOUR-COIL GEOMETRY RATHER THAN THE END-CORRECTED, SIXTH-ORDER LONG SOLENOID TRADITIONALLY USED FOR HIGH-RESOLUTION NMR MAGNETS. THE LARGER BORE OF THE FOUR-COIL GEOMETRY WILL PERMIT THE INSERTION OF GRADIENT COILS FOR IMAGING PURPOSES WHILE LEAVING REASONABLE SPACE FOR THE PROBE AND SAMPLE.

THE MOST INNOVATIVE (AND CONSEQUENTLY RADICAL) CONCEPTS TEND TO COME FROM KIT-BUILDERS, SINCE THEY ARE NOT REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH PART 23. HOWEVER, SOME NOVEL CONCEPTS HAVE BEEN, AND CONTINUE TO BE, PRESENTED TO THE FAAFOR CERTIFICATION (E.G. THE AEROSPATIALE/MOONEY TBM 700 USESSPOILERS FOR ROLL CONTROL, AND BEECH STARSHIP WITH ITS FORWARD WING AND TIPSAILS). AND, TESTING GOING ON AT MANUFACTURERS AND MODIFIERS FACILITIES INDICATES THAT MORE ARE TO FOLLOW (E.G. SIDESTICK CONTROLLERS, CANARDS, AND WINGLETS). THERE IS CURRENTLY NO REFERENCE THAT CAN BE USEDBY DESIGNERS AND FAA EVALUATORS (WHERE APPLICABLE) TO ASSES THE PROS AND CONS OF NOVEL CONCEPTS. EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT THE TIME-HONORED METHOD OF EXTRAPOLATING FROM PAST EXPERIENCE IS NOT EFFECTIVE FOR MANY NOVEL CONCEPTS, AND THEPROPOSED DESIGN GUIDE IS INTENDED TO FILL THAT GAP. THE GOALS OF THE DESIGN GUIDE ARE TO: 1) PROVIDE DATA TO THE DESIGNER WHICH INDENTIFIES THE TRADEOFFS FOR COMPETING NOVELCONCEPTS, AND 2) PROVIDE SUFFICIENT BACKGROUNG TO ALLOW A MORE INFORMED CERTIFICATION PROCESS FOR PART 23 AIRCRAFT. IF SUCCESSFUL, THIS PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE THE KNOWLEDGE-BASE REQUIRED TO MAKE INFORMED DESIGN TRADEOFFS RELATIVE TO NOVELAERONAUTICAL CONCEPTS. IF SUCCESSFUL, THE DATA WILL BE PUBLISHED IN BOOK FORM, WITH UPDATES TO SUBSCRIBERS, SIMILARTO THE ENGINEERING SCIENCES DATA UNIT VOLUMES (ESDU).",

RECENTLY, MEDICAL RESEARCH HAS REVEALED THAT ESWL CAN CAUSE A VARIETY OF ACUTE AND POSSIBLY CHRONIC INJURIES. THE PROPAGATION ANDFOCUSING OF SHOCK WAVES IN, AND THEIR INTERACTION WITH, TISSUE AND CALCULI IS SUFFICIENTLY COMPLEX THAT THE ASPECTS OF THE PRESSURE FIELD CONTRIBUTING TO INJURY AND TO STONE FRAGMENTATION CANNOT YET BE IDENTIFIED. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE RESEARCH IS TO GAIN FUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROPERTIES OF CONVERGENT SHOCK WAVES IN TISSUES, AND THEIR INTERACTION WITH STONE MATERIALS. A CONCOMITANT OBJECTIVE IS TO EMPLOY THE KNOWLEDGE SO GAINED TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING INSTRUMENTATION TO BOTH DIAGNOSE AND CONTROL THE LITOTRIPSY PROCESS. THE EFFECT OF A CALCULUS ON BACK-SCATTERED AND FORWARD-SCATTERED WAVES WILL BE MEASURED AND EVALUATED IN THE TIME AND FREQUENCY DOMAINS. EFFECTS PRODUCED BY TISSUE PHANTOMS AND THE ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION OF SCATTERED WAVES WILL BE MEASURED. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT BY COMBINING KEY ELEMENTS OF THE INTERACTION PROCESS WITH INNOVATIVE ALGORITHMS, THE BASIS FOR A NEW CLASS OF DIAGNOSTIC INSTRUMENTATION WILL BE DEMONSTRATED.",

THESE SECTIONS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY A BLUNT TRAILING EDGE WITH A SEPARATED, NONCAVITATING WAKE. THE EFFECT OF THE BLUNT TRAILING EDGE, WHEN COUPLED WITH AN APPROPRIATE SECTION PROFILE, IS TWOFOLD: 1) THE LOW PRESSURE ON THE BLADE SURFACE IS RELIEVED WHICH RESULTS IN A DELAY OF THE ONSET OF CAVITATION; 2) THE THICKENED TRAILING EDGE INCREASES THE SECTION MODULUS WHICH CAN LEAD TO A REDUCTION IN DRAG FOR A GIVEN STRENGTH REQUIREMENT. THE PROPOSED PHASE I WORK IS DIVIDED INTO TWO TASKS: TASK 1 WILL BE DIRECTED TO EXPLORATORY DEVELOPMENT THROUGH PARAMETRIC STUDIES AIMED AT DETERMINING THE MOST SUITABLE PROFILES WITH REGARD TO CAVITATION INCEPTION, STRENGTH, AND DRAG. THIS DATA WILL BE ANALUZED TO IDENTIFY DESIRABLE FOIL CHARACTERISTICS AND TRENDS. TASK 2 WILL QUANTIFY THE POTENTIAL GAINS IN EFFICIENCY AND/OR CAVITATION INCEPTION SPEED IN ACTUAL SHIP APPLICATIONS. IT IS PROPOSED TO CARRY OUT DESIGN STUDIES FOR TWO REPRESENTATIVE NAVY SHIPS WHICH PROVIDE AN ESTABLISHED BASELINE.

SOLID-LIQUID PHASE CHANGES IN HIGHLY CORROSIVE SALTS, SUCH AS LIF, ARE FAR FROM IDEAL FOR SUPPLYING THE THERMAL DEMANDS OF DYNAMIC POWER CONVERTERS. IN THEORY, PHASE CHANGE MATERIALS STORE HEAT ISOTHERMALLY BUT UNDERCOOLING AND HEAT TRANSFER TS CAUSE SIGNIFICANT TEMPERATURE DEVIATIONS. METAL HYDRIDES ARE COMPETITIVE WITH MOLTEN SALTS IN TERMS OF WEIGHT AND SUPERIOR IN TERMS OF HEAT STORED PER UNIT OF VOLUME. THE MOST IMPORTANT ADVANTAGE OF HYDRIDES IS THEIR ABILITY TO RETURN HEAT TO THE RECEIVER OF A DYNAMIC CONVERTER WITHOUT A REDUCTION IN TEMPERATURE. THIS EFFECT MAY BE ACHIEVED BY DEVELOPING PAIRS OF METAL HYDRIDES, OPERATING INTANDEM TO PUMP WASTE HEAT FROM THE RADIATOR LOOP TO THE RECEIVER. A TEMPERATURE SWING IN ONE OF THE TWO HYDRIDES OVERCOMES THE IRREVERSIBLE ENERGY LOSSES OF STORING AND RECOVERING HEAT FROM THE OTHER. IN EFFECT, THIS PROVIDES ISOTHERMAL HEAT STORAGE, MAINTAINING FULL RATED OUTPUT FROM THE POWER SYSTEM WHILE THE STORED HEAT IS RECOVERED. THE PHASE I R&D; WORK WOULD PROVIDE A BASIS FOR COMPARISON TO ALTERNATE CONCEPTS, AND FOR THE FABRICATION OF A GROUND TEST ARTICLE IN PHASE II.",

HTSC FILMS HAVE POTENTIAL FOR IR DETECTION OFFERING SEVERAL ADVANTAGES OVER EXISTING IR SENSING TECHNOLOGIES: (1) DETECTION TO LONGER WAVELENGTHS, UP TO 50 MICROMETERS; (2) REDUCED CRYOGENIC CONSTRAINTS SIGNIFICANTLY SIMPLIFYING SYSTEM DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION; (3) A NON-EQUILIBRIUM DETECTION MECHANISM IMPLYING EXTREMELY FAST RESPONSE TIMES - BELOW A NANOSECOND - POTENTIALLY CRITICAL IN HIGH SPEED MULTIPLE-TARGET DETECTION AND TRACKING. HTSC FILM RESPONSE TO IR RADIATION OCCURS THROUGH TWO MECHANISMS: BOLOMETRIC (HEATING), AND NON-EQUILIBRIUM. RECENT EXTENSIVE RESEARCH BY NUMEROUS LABORATORIES HAS FAILED TO LEAD TO A CONSENSUS ON THE PREDOMINANT MECHANISMS AND POTENTIAL OF THE TECHNOLOGY. THIS LACK OF CONCLUSIVE RESULTS IS DUE LARGELY TO THE EXTREMELY WIDE VARIATION IN MATERIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SMAPLES TESTED. THIS PROPOSAL FOCUSES ON THE NON-EQUILIBRIUM MECHANISM WITH ITS SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES IN VERY FAST RESPONSE TIMES AND RELAXED CRYOGENIC REQUIREMENTS. IN PHASE I HYPRES WILL CONDUCT THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES TO ESTABLISH THE EXISTENCE AND VIABILITY OF A NON-EQUILIBRIUM MECHANISM.

IN STUDIES OF THE CD4 ATTACHMENT SITE ON THE HIV ENVELOPE, A SYNTHETIC PEPTIDE THAT MAY BE A STRONG CANDIDATE THERAPEUTIC AGENT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED. THE PEPTIDE, TERMED A25D, REPRESENTS AN 18-AMINO ACID SEQUENCE FROM THE PUTATIVE CD4 ATTACHMENT SITE ON GP120, AND BIOPHYSICAL COMPARISONS SUGGEST THAT IT CONTAINS BOTH B- AND T-CELL EPITOPES. A25D BLOCKS HIV TRANSMISSION IN VITRO AS DETERMINED IN A STANDARD SYNCYTIAL FORMATION ASSAY; HOWEVER, STUDIES PERFORMED ON HIV-INFECTED INDIVIDUALS INDICATE THAT BOTH B- AND T-CELL RESPONSES TO THE PEPTIDE ARE MINIMAL. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT ALTHOUGH A25D MAY REPRESENT A CRITICAL EPITOPE ON THE HIV BINDING SITE CAPABLE OF INDUCINGGROUP-SPECIFIC NEUTRALIZATION, THIS POTENTIAL IS NOT REALIZED IN MOST INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE THE HIGHLY IMMUNODOMINANT REGIONS OF THE ENVELOPE ESTABLISH A CLONAL DOMINANCE AND SUPPRESS EFFECTIVE RESPONSES TO THE ATTACHMENTSITE. PHASE I WILL EXAMINE THE POTENTIAL UTILITY OF A25D AND RELATED PEPTIDES AS AGENTS TO PROMOTE ACTIVE ANTI-HIV IMMUNITY. THE ABILITY OF THE MATERIAL TO INDUCE ANTI-GP120 RESPONSES IN MICE AND RABBITS WILL BE TESTED. FURTHERMORE, A25D AND RELATED SYNTHETIC AND RECOMBINANT PEPTIDES WILL BE USED TO SCREEN AND CHARACTERIZE THE SERA OF HIV-INFECTED INDIVIDUALS AND SIV-INFECTED MACAQUES FOR VIRUS-NEUTRALIZINGANTIBODIES. THEIR ABILITY TO STIMULATE VIRION PRODUCTION BY STIMULATING INFECTED LYMPHOCYTES WILL ALSO BE DETERMINED.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         ELEVATED SERUM CHOLESTEROL (DYSLIPIDEMIA) IS COMMON AND IS AMAJOR RISK FACTOR FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. THE DYSLIPIDEMIA MONITORING SYSTEM (DMS), DEVELOPED IN THIS PROJECT, IS A COMPUTER-BASED TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM THAT ASSISTS PHYSICIANS IN MANAGING AMBULATORY DYSLIPIDEMIA PATIENTS BY TRACKING THEM BETWEEN OFFICE VISITS BY WEEKLY TELEPHONE CONVERSATIONS WITH PATIENTS IN THEIR HOMES. THE DMS USES COMPUTER-CONTROLLED SPEECH SYNTHESIS TO SPEAK. THE PATIENTS COMMUNICATE BY DEPRESSING KEYS ON A TOUCH-TONE TELEPHONE. THE DMS COSTS $12 PER PATIENT YEAR. IT ASKS PATIENTS TO REPORT THEIR CURRENT WEIGHT, DIETARY INTAKE, EXERCISE, MEDICATION-TAKING KNOWLEDGE AND COMPLIANCE, AND ANY SYMPTOMS SUGGESTING SIDE EFFECTS. THE DMS RESPONDS TO THE ANSWERS OF PATIENTS BY GIVING FEEDBACK TO MOTIVATE THEM TO ADHERE TO LOW FAT AND CHOLESTEROL DIETS, TO ENGAGE IN REGULAR EXERCISE, AND TO TAKE ANY PRESCRIBED LIPID-LOWERING MEDICATIONS COMPLETELY. THE SYSTEM STORES AND TRANSMITS INFORMATION REPORTED BY THE PATIENT TO THE PHYSICIAN ON A PRINTED REPORT, ALERTING THE PHYSICIAN TO ANY POTENTIAL PROBLEMS. THE DMS WILL BE (1) PILOT TESTED WITH 15 PATIENTS AND 92) EVALUATED IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL OF 135 PATIENTS SEEN IN A GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE PRACTICE. THE ENDPOINTS WILL BE THE CHANGES IN PATIENTS' SELF-CARE BEHAVIORS (EXERCISE, DIET, AND MEDICATION TAKING) AND SERUM LIPID LEVELS. THE USABILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY TO PATIENT AND PHYSICIAN USERS WILL BE MEASURED BY ATTITUDINAL QUESTIONNAIRES, AND THE OPERATING COSTS WILL BE CALCULATED.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A NEW HIGH-TEMPERATURE DIRECTIONAL SPECTRAL EMISSIVITY MEASUREMENT SYSTEM BASED ON A SPECIAL INTEGRATING SPHERE CONFIGURATION. CURRENTLY AVAILABLE SYSTEMS MEASURE ONLY THE NORMAL EMISSIVITY AT TEMPERATURES APPROACHING 1000 DEGREES CENTIGRADE WITH UNKNOWN ACCURACY, BY MEASURING THE EMITTED FLUX WHICH IS HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO TEMPERATURE UNCERTAINTIES. THE PROPOSED APPROACH MEASURES THE EMISSIVITY IN ANY DIRECTION (NORMAL TO 80 DEGREES) IN THE WAVELENGTH REGION 0.25 M - 25 M, FROM ROOM TEMPERATURE TO 3000 DEGREES CENTIGRADE WITH A THEORETICALLY ESTABLISHED ACCURACY (TO BE CONFIRMED EXPERIMENTALLY) BY MEASURING THE REFLECTED ENERGY WHICH IS INSENITIVE TO SAMPLE TEMPERATURE UNCERTAINTIES. THE INNOVATION ADDRESSES THE WIND TUNNEL INSTRUMENTATION AREA TO MEASURE TEMPERATURE AND HEAT FLUX IN THE RANGE 1500 DEGREES CENTIGRADE - 3000 DEGREES CENTIGRADE. WITH KNOWN DIRECTIONAL SPECTRAL EMISSIVITY, THE TEMPERATURE IS DIRECTLY OBTAINED FROM THE EMITTED FLUX. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE IS TO VALIDATE THE MEASUREMENT PROCEDURE AND THEORETICAL ACCURACY EXPERIMENTALLY AT TEMPERATURES REACHING 3000 DEGREES CENTIGRADE. THIS WILL BE DONE BY ASSEMBLING THE INTEGRATING SPHERE CONFIGURATION AND OTHER ESSENTIAL EQUIPMENT IN AN EXPERIMENTAL MEASUREMENT SYSTEM. IN PHASE I, THE CONCEPT FEASIBILITY WILL BE DEMONSTRATED AT ROOM TEMPERATURE; IN PHASE II, THE RESEARCH WILL BE DIRECTED TOWARD DEMONSTRATION AT HIGH TEMPERATURES. THE MAIN ANTICIPATED RESULT IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A HIGH-TEMPERATURE HIGH-ACCURACY DIRECTIONAL EMISSIVITY MEASUREMENT SYSTEM.",

RECENT IMPROVEMENTS IN SENSORS EMPLOYING SILICON DIODE DETECTORS SUGGEST THAT FREQUENCIES APPROACHING 500 MHZ CAN BE USED. AT THIS FREQUENCY, THE AMPLITUDE MODULATION INDEX OF THE EMERGENT PHOTONS DEPENDS UPON THE PATH LENGTH AS, FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE ATTENUATION CHARACTERISTIC OF A PARALLEL RC NETWORK. WHEREAS THE PHASE CHARACTERISTIC OF SUCH AN RC NETWORK FOR TISSUE STUDIES HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY EMPHASIZED, IN THIS PROJECT THE AMPLITUDE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PHOTON MIGRATION WILL BE STUDIED. THIS RESEARCH WILL EVALUATE MEASUREMENT OF THE AMPLITUDE INDEX AT 440 MHZ WITH 140 MHZ AS A REFERENCE FREQUENCY. THEPROPOSED INSTRUMENT MEASURES THE RATIO (OR DIFFERENCE) OF THE AMPLITUDE MODULATION INDEX AT A LOW AND A HIGH FREQUENCYAND AT TWO WAVELENGTHS. THE ATTENUATION CHARACTERISTIC AT THE TWO FREQUENCIES AND TWO WAVELENGTHS BECOMES A MEASURE OFPATH LENGTH CHANGES.

THE DESIGN LENDS ITSELF NATURALLY TO PARALLEL COMPUTING ON COMPUTING NETWORKS. 2. CODE A PROTOTYPE SYSTEM USING THE DESIGN, DEMONSTRATING THE VIABILITY AND STRENGTHS OF THE SYSTEM. 3. PREPARE A DETAILED REPORT THAT INCLUDES THE DESIGN, RESULTS OF COMPUTATIONAL EXPERIMENTS, AND FUTURE PLANS FOR THE TECHNOLOGY. THE METHODS BUILD UPON THE PROVEN STRENGTHS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH TECHNIQUES (E.G., GENERALIZED ASSIGNMENT ALGORITHMS) FOR VEHICLE ROUTING, BUT SIGNIFICANTLY AMPLIFY THE PERFORMANCE OF THE TECHNIQUES BY USING NEURAL NETWORK AND GENETIC SEARCH PARADIGMS TO SET PARAMETERS AND ADAPTIVELY GUIDE THEIR COMPUTATIONS. THE METHODS ARE NEW TO THE VEHICLE ROUTING AND SCHEDULING PROBLEM SOLVING DOMAIN. PRELIMINARY TESTING SUGGESTS THAT SOLUTION QUALITY IS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN WHAT ANY OF THE UNDERLYING MATHEMATICAL METHODS WORKING INDIVIDUALLY CAN ACHIEVE. THE PRIMARY ISSUES TO BE RESOLVED INCLUDE THE TOPOLOGY OF THE NEURAL NETWORKS, THE PARAMETERS AND DEGREES OF FREEDOM OF THE GENETIC ALGORITHMS, AND SOME DETAILS OF THE UNDERLYING HEURISTIC BEING CONTROLLED.

        "abstract": "Abstract         OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS, VARIOUS METHODS FOR REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF RADIATION EXPOSURE ASSOCIATED WITH FLUOROSCOPIC EXAMINATIONS HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED. SOME HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED, BUT NONE HAVE FOUND THEIR WAY INTO THE MAINSTREAM OF ROUTINE CLINICAL PRACTICE. PREVIOUS METHODS HAVE FAILED FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS: INADEQUATE TEMPORAL RESOLUTION, CUMBERSOME INSTRUMENTATION, UNACCEPTABLE MOTION ARTIFACTS, OR A COMBINATION THEREOF. THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP A DIGITAL FLUOROSCOPIC VIDEO IMAGEPROCESSOR (VIP) CAPABLE OF SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING RADIATION EXPOSURE TO PATIENTS AND TO RADIOLOGY PROFESSIONAL STAFF WHILE MAINTAINING THE INTEGRITY OF THE FLUOROSCOPIC EXAM IN TERMS OF TEMPORAL AND CONTRAST RESOLUTION, IMAGE NOISE, AND DIGITAL PROCESSING ARTIFACTS. THE VIP WILL OPTIMIZE THE USE OF RADIATION EXPOSURE THROUGH TWO STRATEGIES: MOTION DETECTION AND AUTOMATIC IMAGE ZOOM CONTROL. MOTION DETECTION WILL BE USED TO ADJUST THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE INCIDENT RADIATION EXPOSURE RATE AND THELEVEL OF RECURSIVE FRAME AVERAGING IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE APPARENT LEVEL OF FLUOROSCOPIC IMAGE NOISE REMAINS CONSTANT. AN AUTOMATIC 2:1 DIGITAL ZOOM FEATURE WILL ALLOW THE RADIOLOGIST TO OBTAIN MAGNIFIED VIEWS WITHOUT REQUIRING THE DOSE RATE INCREASE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ELECTRONIC MAGNIFICATION FEATURE OF X-RAY IMAGE INTENSIFIERS. DURING PHASE I, A PROTOTYPE OF THE PROPOSED DEVICE WILL BE CONSTRUCTED AND TESTED. DURING PHASE II, A LOW-COST, DEDICATED DEVICE WILL BE DESIGNED, BUILT, AND EVALUATED IN ASERIES OF CLINICAL STUDIES.",

WHILE OCCUPYING MINIMAL PORT SPACE. IN ADDITION, DIAGNOSTICSYSTEMS REQUIRED FOR MACHINES SUCH AS CIT OR ITER MUST BE RADIATION HARDENED OR CAPABLE OF REMOTE LOCATION. THE PRESENT PROPOSAL SEEKS TO DEVELOP A SINGLE DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM TO MEASURE ON A SINGLE TOKAMAK DISCHARGE BOTH ELECTRON DENSITY AND TEMPERATURE PROFILES, AS WELL AS FLUCTUATIONS IN THESE QUANTITIES AT VARIOUS RADIAL LOCATIONS. THE SYSTEM WOULD COMBINE MANY OF THE DEMONSTRATED CAPABILITIES OF ELECTRON CYCLOTRON EMISSION (ECE) AND MILLIMETER-WAVE REFLECTOMETRY DIAGNOSTICS INTO A SINGLE HYBRID SYSTEM. PROFILE INFORMATION WOULD BE OBTAINEDBY OPERATING IN A FREQUENCY SWEPT MODE, WHEREAS LOCAL VARIATIONS IN TE AND NE WOULD BE ACHIEVED BY OPERATING AT A FIXED FREQUENCY. THE PHASE I RESEARCH PROGRAM WILL INVESTIGATE THE APPLICATION OF SUCH A HYBRID DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM TO A VARIETY OF EXISTING AND PLANNED TOKAMAK DEVICES. CONCEPTUAL HARDWARE DESIGNS WILL BE GENERATED FOR VARIOUS EXISTING MAINLINE FUSION DEVICES. IN ADDITION, TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATION ON A MACHINE SUCH AS CIT WILL BE SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED AND APPROPRIATE SOLUTIONSIDENTIFIED.

FOR EXAMPLE, IT WILL HAVE HIGHER REACTION RATES, A LOWER PRESSURE DROP THAN PARALLEL PLATE BEDS, WILL NOT REQUIRE QUARTZ WINDOWS OR CYCLONES, AND WILL MINIMIZE POLLUTION PROBLEMS. OUR RESEARCH PLAN IS TO DESIGN AND BUILD A PHOTOCHEMICAL ROTATING FLUIDIZED BED REACTOR.

EXPERIMENTSWITH A SLOW-SCANNING BREADBOARD INSTRUMENT HAVE DEMONSTRATED(1) A 100X IMPROVEMENT IN SENSITIVITY OVER PRESENT PHOTOGRAPHIC METHODS, AND (2) THE POTENTIAL FOR MEASURING SAMPLE FLUORESCENCE MORE ACCURATELY BY EMPLOYING IMPROVED TECHNIQUES TO CONTROL AND CORRECT FOR VARIATION IN BACKGROUND FLUORESCENCE. THE MASS OF DNA IN A BAND IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE SUMMED FLUORESCENCE SIGNAL. IN PHASE I, THE PRESENT BREADBOARD WILL BE MODIFIED TO SCAN 100X FASTER WITH A HIGHER OUTPUT LASER IN ORDER TO SCAN A 20-CM-LONG GEL LANE IN UNDER 5 MINUTES. THE GREATER SPEED AND DATA-HANDLING CAPACITY WILL PERMIT PERFORMING THE EXTENSIVE TESTING REQUIRED TO MORE FULLY ESTABLISH INSTRUMENTAL AND ANALYTICAL PERFORMANCE, AND STUDYING FURTHER SAMPLES IN SEVERAL TYPES OF GELS. AN ENGINEERING PROTOTYPE WILL BE BUILT AND EXTENSIVELY TESTED IN PHASE II THAT WILL USE A HIGHER POWER LASER, IMPROVED DATA-HANDLING TECHNIQUES, AND OTHER IMPROVEMENTS TOFURTHER INCREASE MEASUREMENT SPEED AND AUTOMATION.",

PHASE II EFFORTS WILL CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY POLYMORPHIC MARKERS AND MOVE TOWARD CLONING THE CMM GENE IF THE DATA CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE REGIONAL LOCALIZATION TO 1P36. THE MARKERS ISOLATED IN PHASES I AND II MAY BE USED FOR PRESYMPTOMATIC DIAGNOSIS OF AT-RISK INDIVIDUALS AND FOR POPULATION SCREENING. THESE CLONES WILL BE ISOLATED FROM A RODENT-HUMAN SOMATIC CELL HYBRID THAT INCLUDES THE SHORT ARM OF CHROMOSOME 1 AS ITS SOLE HUMAN COMPONENT. THE CLONES WILL BE MAPPED BY FLUORESCENT IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION AND ON SOMATIC CELL HYBRID PANELS, AND ADDED TO THE GENETIC LINKAGE MAP OF CHROMOSOME 1 BY TYPING THE CEPH REFERENCE FAMILIES. THIS APPROACH WILL BE USED TO SIMULTANEOUSLY DEVELOP BOTH THE GENETIC AND PHYSICAL MAPS OF THIS REGION.",

ONE APPROACH TO THIS PROBLEM INVOLVES INTEGRATING THE STRUCTURAL AND CONTROL DESIGN VIA AN OPTIMIZATION APPROACH. THIS ALLOWS A GREAT DEAL OF FLEXIBILITY IN THE TRADEOFF BETWEEN DESIGN FEATURES, SUCH AS WEIGHT AND POWER REQUIREMENTS, ENTIRELY THROUGH COST FUNCTION SELECTION. THIS APPROACH HAS BEEN USED BEFORE, BUT IN SUCH CASES IT WAS ASSUMED THAT BOTH THE CONTROLLER GAINS AND STRUCTURAL PARAMETERS COULD VARY CONTINUOUSLY OVER SOME SPECIFIED RANGE. THIS APPROACH IS UNREALISTIC SINCE IT IS NOT FEASIBLE FROM EITHER A COST OR A TECHNICAL STANDPOINT TO CONTRUCT A STRUCTURE WHERE EVERY MEMBER IS UNIQUE. IN THIS STUDY, WE PROPOSE TO LIMIT THE STRUCTURAL MEMBERS TO SOME PREDEFINED SET OF AVAILABLE ELEMENTS, AND USE A COMBINATORIAL OPTIMIZATION APPROACH FOR THEIR SELECTION. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR CONTINUOUSLY VARYING CONTROLLER PARAMETERS AND DISCRETLY VARYING STRUCTURAL PARAMETERS, WHILE STILL ACHIEVING AN OPTIMAL DESIGN.",

THE MMAE APPROACH PROVIDES FILTER ROBUSTNESS IN SYSTEMS WITH UNCERTAIN MODEL PARAMETERS OR PARAMETER CHANGES, TYPICALLY RELATED TO SOURCES OF PROCESS NOISE OR MEASUREMENT NOISE. HOWEVER, WITH CONVENTIONAL KALMAN FILTERS, THIS APPROACH IS IMPRACTICAL WHEN MORE THAN TWO OR THREE UNCERTAIN PARAMETERS EXIST. THE DKF METHOD PERMITS A LARGE, MULTI-SENSOR FILTER TO BE PARTITIONED INTO A SET OF SMALLER LOCAL FILTERS OPERATINGIN PARALLEDL, PLUS A MASTER FILTER PERIODICALLY COMBINING THE LOCAL FILTER SOLUTIONS. THE DKF METHOD PROVIDES OPTIMAL OR NEAR-OPTIMAL ACCURACY, REDUCE PROCESSING BURDEN, AND IMPROVE FAULT TOLERANCE. THE DKF/MMAE (DMAE) TECHNIQUES DEVELOPED HERE WILL ALLOW A LARGE NUMBER OF UNCERTAIN SENSOR PARAMETERS TO BE ACCOMMODATED, VIA LOCAL ADAPTATION OF MULTIPLE LOCAL MODELS, PLUS GLOBAL ADAPTATION AT THE MASTER LEVEL.

EXTREMELY LOW NOISE AMPLIFICATION IS REQUIRED TO AVOID POOR SIGNAL TO NOISE RATIOS SINCE ANALOG SUMS OF ALL THE DETECTOR SIGNALS ARE PERFORMED FOR TRIGGER PURPOSES. FAST SIGNAL PROCESSING SPEED IMPOSED BY THE EVENT RATES OF PRESENT AND FUTURE ACCELERATORS REQUIRE THE PREAMPLIFIER TO BE LOCATED AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO THE DETECTOR TO MINIMIZE THE INDUCTANCE OF CONNECTIONS. IN ADDITION, IT MUST BE RUGGED ENOUGH TO WITHSTAND THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION AND ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE, AND, IN THE CASE LIQUID ARGON CALORIMETERS, OPERATE AT VERY LOW TEMPERATURES. PRESENT PREAMPLIFIERS ARE MADE ON SMALL HYBRID CIRCUITS LOCATED NEAR THE DETECTOR. JUNCTION FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTORS (JFETS) HAVE TYPICALLY BEEN CHOSEN AS THEACTIVE DEVICE IN THESE CIRCUITS, BECAUSE THEY EXHIBIT ADVANTAGES OVER OTHER TYPES OF TRANSISTORS. THE OBJECT OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO IMPROVE UPON PRESENT CALORIMETER PREAMPLIFIERS THROUGH THE USE OF NEW JFET DEVICES WHICH EMPLOY DESIGN AND PROCESS CHANGES SPECIFIC TO THIS APPLICATION. THIS WILL BE DONE BY DESINGING A JFET THAT RESPONDS TO THE SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS OF THIS APPLICATION. AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT INCLUDE BETTER NOISE CHARACTERISTICS ATLIQUID ARGON TEMPERATURE, IMPROVED RADIATION HARDNESS, BETTER MATCHING OF DC ELECTRICAL PARAMETERS TO THE NEEDS OF THE CIRCUIT, AND HIGHER RELIABILITY. THESE REQUIREMENTS WILL BE ADDRESSED BY CONSIDERING ISSUES RELATING TO THE DESIGN OR LAYOUT OF THE TRANSISTOR, MANUFACTURING METHODS, SPECIFICATION PARAMETERS OF THE SILICON MATERIALS, AND PACKAGING OF THE TRANSISTOR CHIP.",

DUCKWEEDS ARE FLOATING AQUATIC PLANTS BELONGING TO THE FAMILY LEMNACEAE, WHICH IF GROWN ON NUTRIENT RICH WATER, ARE RICH IN HIGH QUALITY PROTEIN, CAROTENOIDS AND ZANTHOPHYLL. DUCKWEED NUTRIENTS HAVE HEEN DEMONSTRATED AS VALUABLE INGREDIENTS IN ANIMAL FEEDS AND MAY HAVE POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN NUTRITION. THE EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM WILL BE DIRECTED TOWARD GAINING INSIGHTS INTO THE TWO MAIN OPTIONS FOR CONCENTRATION OF THE DUCKWEED NUTRIENTS: (A) DESICCATION OF WHOLE AND MACERATED PLANTS AND (B) EXTRACTION OF NUTRIENTS, PRIMARILY BY COAGULATING PROTEIN AND OTHER NUTRIENTS WHICH COAGULATE ALONG WITH PROTEIN. CRETERIA FOR EVALUATING EACH TECHNIQUE WILL BE PROCESSING COST AND PRODUCT YIELD AND QUALITY.

MICROGRAVITY AND OTHER CONDITIONS DURING SPACE FLIGHT CREATE NEW HEALTH PROBLEMS AND NEW REQUIREMENTS FOR METHODS OF DRUG DELIVERY. IN MANY INSTANCES, MEDICAL PROCEDURES APPLICABLE ON EARTH ARE ILL SUITED TO THE ENVIRONMENT OF SPACE, WHICH REQUIRES MINIMUM WEIGHT AND VOLUME, ELIMINATION OF FLUID HANDLING, AND EASE OF OPERATION WITHOUT SPECIALIZED TRAINING OR REFERRAL TO FULLY EQUIPPED CENTERS. THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL CENTER ON THE PRELIMINARY DEVELOPMENT OF AN IONTOPHORETIC SYSTEM TO TREAT MEDICAL CONDITIONS OCCURRING IN SPACE SPACE FLIGHT BY PARENTERAL DELIVERY OF DRUGS. SPECIFICALLY, THE RESEARCH WILL INCLUDE:1) DETERMINATION OF THE SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS TO INTEGRATE WITH NASA REQUIREMENTS; 2) DESIGN OF A BATTERY POWERED IONTOPHORETIC DOSE CONTROLLER (IDC); 3) SYNTHESIS OF A POLYMERIC HYDROGEL MATRIX TO CONTAIN THE DRUGS; 4) FABRICATION OF A MODEL SYSTEM AND PRELIMINARY LABORATORY CHARACTERIZATION, WHICH WILL INCLUDE MEASUREMENTS OF DRUG TRANSPORT, TOXICITY AND DERMAL IRRITATION TESTS. THE FINAL PRODUCT WILL BE A COMPACT, LIGHTWEIGHT SYSTEM FOR PAINLESS, NON-INVASIVE, NON-FLUIDIC, CONTROLLABLE DELIVERY OF DRUGS BY THE PARENTERAL ROUTE. TO DELINEATE THE SPECIFICATIONS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SYSTEM, THREE MODEL DRUGS, FENTANYL, GALLIUM AND SCOPOLAMINE, FOR TREATMENT OF SEVERE PAIN, BONE DEMINERALIZATION AND MOTION SICKNESS, HAVE BEEN SELECTED FOR THE PROJECT",

ANIMAL IN VIVO STUDIES OF HA-COATED DENTAL IMPLANTS WILL BE CONDUCTED TO CLINICALLY AND HISTOLOGICALLY EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF THE HA COATING ON BONE AND SOFT TISSUES THAT INTERFACE THE IMPLANT ROOT PORTION, AND ON TISSUE HEALING AND IMPLANT FUNCTIONAL STAGES. EVALUATION OF COATING BOND STRENGTH, CRYSTALLOGRAPHY, INTEGRITY, AND DURABILITY WILL ALSO BE DONE, AS WELL AS INVESTIGATION OF SEVERAL ALTERNATIVE ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES FOR THE DETERMINATION OF COATING STRUCTURE AND CRYSTALLOGRAPHY FOR QUALITY CONTROL. HA IS THE MOST BIOCOMPATIBLE MATERIAL KNOWN, AND TREATMENT OF ALUMINA AND TITANIUM DENTAL IMPLANTS SHOULD IMPROVE CLINICAL LONGEVITY RATES. ION-BEAM AND ELECTRON-PLASMA-COATED IMPLANTS SHOULD STABILIZE FASTER IN BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS, PROMOTE SHORTER HEALING PERIODS, AND ALLOW RAPID RESTORATION OF THE DENTAL APPARATUS TO A FULLY FUNCTIONAL PHYSIOLOGICAL STATE.

THE ABILITY TO ADDRESS FUNCTIONSAT A NEUROLOGICAL LEVEL OFTEN REQUIRES THE USE OF EXTREMELY SMALL, INDEPENDENTLY ADDRESSABLE ELECTRODES IN THE 1 TO 2 MICRON RANGE. IT IS ADVANTAGEOUS FOR THE ELECTRONIC CIRCUITRY THAT INTERACTS WITH THESE ELECTRODES TO BE IN THE IMMEDIATE PROXIMITY OF THE ELECTRODES. THIS REQUIREMENT HAS LEAD TO ELECTRONIC PACKAGES WHERE THE ACTIVE ELECTRONIC CIRCUITS ANDELECTRODE INTERFACES COEXIST ON SINGLE INTEGRATED SUBSTRATESTHAT MUST THEN BE IMPLANTED WITHIN THE BODY. THE BODY ENVIRONMENT, BEING ONE OF WARM SALT WATER AND FLUCTUATING ELECTRIC FIELDS, MANDATES THAT AN ELECTRONIC PACKAGE OF THISTYPE BE WELL INSULATED ELECTRICALLY, CORROSION RESISTANT, AND IMPERVIOUS TO WATER PERMEATION.

EACH NEW APPLICATION REQUIRES A NEW FPA DEVELOPMENT. WITH THE ADVENT OF Z-PLANE FPA ARCHITECTURES, THE ELECTRONICS CIRCUIT AREA NOW EXISTS TO PROVIDE PROGRAMMABLE ANALOG AND DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSINGCHANNELS FOR EACH ELEMENT OF A TWO-DIMENSIONAL DETECTOR ARRAY. EXPLOITING THIS, IRVINE SENSORS CORPORATION (ISC) HAS CONCEIVED AN INNOVATIVE CIRCUIT CONCEPT THAT, WHEN DEVELOPED, WILL BE GENERIC TO SENSORS AS DIVERSE AS HIGH RESOLUTION VISIBLE AND INFRARED IMAGERS, SPECTROMETERS, AND LIGHTNING MAPPERS. THE CIRCUIT WILL PROVIDE ON-BOARD CALIBRATION, DATA COMPRESSION, IMAGE MOTION COMPENSATION, AND BACKGROUND SUPPRESSION, WHILE MAINTAINING LOW NOISE, HIGH DYNAMIC RANGE AND LOW POWER DISSIPATION.

THE PROSTHESES ARE DESIGNED TO FACILITATE ORAL CONTACTS REQUIRED FOR BILABIAL, LINGUO-ALVEOLAR, AND/OR LINGUO-VELAR PHONEMES. THE DEVICES WERE DEVELOPED TO TREAT PATIENTS WITH LINGUAL AND LABIAL DEFICITS, INCLUDING DYSARTHRIA SECONDARY TO STROKE OR HEAD TRAUMA AND, FOLLOWING LARYNGECTOMY, INSUFFICIENT AIR INJECTION CAPACITY FOR ESOPHAGEAL SPEECH. USING THE DEVICES, 15 PATIENTS WITH STROKE OR HEAD TRAUMA AND 5 LARYNGECTOMIZED PATIENTS WILL BE TREATED FOR 20 DOUBLESESSIONS. CRITERIA FOR SELECTION INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT INTELLIGIBILITY DEFICITS AFTER STABILIZATION DURING SPEECH REHABILITATION. STANDARD TESTS OF INTELLIGIBILITY WILL BE ADMINISTERED AT INTAKE AND ENDPOINTS. DIMENSIONS OF AIR INJECTION CAPACITY WILL BE ASSESSED BY OSCILLOGRAPHIC TRACINGS. SCORING WILL BE BLIND; THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SCORE CHANGES WILL BE TESTED. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS WILL LEAD TO A CASE/CONTROL STUDY WHERETREATED CASES WILL USE THE DEVICES EARLY IN REHABILITATION. THE EXPECTATION IS FOR MORE SUCCESSFUL AND COST-EFFECTIVE REHABILITATION.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A PROGRAM IS PROPOSED TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF USING LASER-INDUCED FLUORESCENCE AS A MEANS OF DETECTING CHEMICAL AGENTS. TARGET IDENTIFICATION WILL BE ACHIEVED BY USING AN INTENSIFIED VIDEO CAMERA TO CAPTURE FLUORESCENCE IMAGES GENERATED WHEN A UV LASER ILLUMINATES THE TARGET VOLUME. THE PHASE I PROGRAM WILL ADDRESS THE LASER TRANSMITTER, RECEIVER, VIDEO CAMERA, IMAGE PROCESSING AND SYSTEM INTEGRATION ISSUES LEADING TO A CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF A PORTABLE SYSTEM. THE SENSOR WILL BE BASED ON AN ELEVEN (11) POUND, COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE, DIODE-PUMPED SOLID-STATE LASER. THE LASER IS A TRIPLED, ND:YAG DEVICE, OPERATING AT 355 NM, AND WILL BE USED AS THE TRANSMITTER OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM. STUDIES OF LASER-INDUCED FLUORESCENCE FROM LABORATORY SAMPLES WILL BE CARRIED OUT TO CHARACTERIZE FLUORESCENCE SPECTRA AND EFFICIENCY. THIS DATA WILL BE INCLUDED IN A SIGNAL-TO-NOISE MODEL WHICH WILL PREDICT THE EXPECTED IMAGING PERFORMANCE OF THE SENSOR AS A FUNCTION OF SYSTEM PARAMETERS AND TARGET RANGE. THE SIGNAL-TO-NOISE PREDICTIONS AND SIZE AND WEIGHT ESTIMATES WILL BE THE PRIMARY CRITERIA TO ESTABLISH FEASIBILITY OF THE PROPOSED IMAGING SENSOR. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL LEAD TO A NEW CAPABILITY IN IMAGING OF FLUORESCENT RETURNS FROM MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL TARGETS. EXAMPLES INCLUDE NARCOTIC CULTIVATION AND PRODUCTION, BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL WARFARE AGENTS, MILITARY VEHICLES, CAMOUFLAGE, OIL SLICKS ON OCEANS, ENVIRONMENTALLY HAZARDOUS EMISSIONS, AND AGRICULTURAL PHENOMENA SUCH AS DROUGHT AND DISEASE. KEY WORDS - LASER-LNDUCED FLUORESCENCE, IMAGING SENSOR, UV LASERS.",

THE SPENT FUEL IS TRANSPORTED THROUGH THESE CAVITIES TO A TEMPORARY STORAGE POOL LOCATED NEAR THE REACTOR. OTHER CONTAMINATED INTERNAL REACTOR COMPONENTS ARE ALSO STORED WITHIN THESE CAVITIES DURING REFUELING. ONCE THE REFUELING OPERATION ARE COMPLETE, THE CAVITIES ARE DRAINED, AND THE REACTOR VESSEL IS REASSEMBLED. BECAUSE RADIOACTIVE PARTICLES BECOME SUSPENDED IN THE WATER AND ADHERE TO THE STAINLESS STEEL LININGS OF THE CAVITIES THEY MUST BE REMOVEDBEFORE THE LINING IS ALLOWED TO DRY IN ORDER TO PREVENT PARTICLES FROM BECOMING AIRBORNE CONTAMINATES. CLEANING THE LARGE SURFACE AREAS IS PERFORMED BY WORKERS WEARING PROTECTIVE CLOTHING WHO MUST CAREFULLY WIPE THE WALL SURFACES WITH CLEAN TOWELS. BOTH TOWELS AND WORKERS GARMENTS BECOME CONTAMINATED AND REQUIRE SPECIAL HALDLING. THIS TIME CONSUMING TASK CAN ADD SEVERAL DAYS TO A REFUELING OUTAGE. THE PRESENT PRACTICE NOT ONLY INCREASES THE COST OF THE OUTAGE IT ALSO EXPOSES WORKERS TO A HAZARDOUS RADIOACTIVE ENVIRONMENT AND CREATES LOW LEVEL WASTE MATERIALS.

THE CONDUCTIVITY IS OF DIRECT INTEREST IN END USE APPLICATIONS INVOLVING ELECTRICAL CONDUSTORS AND ELECTROMAGNETIC SHIELDING.

THIS OPENS THE POSSIBILITY OF ON-LINE REAL-TIME MONITORING OF THE ELECTRICAL AND THERMAL CONDUCTIVITIES, AS WELL AS THE TENSILE MODULUS. THESE SENSORS ARE EXTREMELY SENSITIVE TO SMALL VARIATIONS IN THE CONDUCTIVITY, AND CAN BE DESIGNED FOR USE OVER DYNAMIC RANGES COVERING SEVERAL ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE CHANGE IN THE CONDUCTIVITY.

IT ISADAPTABLE TO CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENTS, EXHIBITS RAPID GROWTH RATES, ACCEPTS ARTIFICIAL FEEDS, HAS BROAD PHYSIOLOGICAL TOLERANCES AND HIGH MARKET VALUE. COMMERCIAL STRIPED BASS FARMING HAS BECOME A REALITY IN THE LAST THREE YEARS, DUE INPART TO ASI RESEARCH FUNDED BY THE NSF SBIR PROGRAM. IN OURFIRST TWO YEARS OF COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION, ASI PRODUCED OVER ONE MILLION POUNDS OF HYBRID STRIPED BASS, SURPASSING THE ENTIRE U.S. COMMERCIAL FISHERY HARVESTS FOR 1987 AND 1988. MAJOR COMMERCIAL START-UPS OF LARGE-SCALE STRIPED BASS FARMSARE UNDERWAY IN SEVERAL STATES AT PRESENT. THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT REMAINING OBSTACLES ARE THE DOMESTICATION OF BROODSTOCK (TO REDUCE OUR DEPENDENCE ON WILD-CAUGHT ADULTS FROM SEASONAL SPAWNING RUNS), AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTENSIVE FINGERLING CULTURE TECHNIQUES (TO ELIMINATE THE NEED TO USE THE UNDEPENDABLE FERTILIZED POND METHOD OF PRODUCING JUVENILES). BOTH OF THESE OBJECTIVES HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED FOR TROUT AND CATFISH, AND HAVE ALLOWED THESE INDUSTRIES TO FLOURISH IN HUNDREDS OF LOCATIONS NATIONWIDE. UPON RESOLUTION OF SIMILAR ISSUES FOR STRIPED BASS, THERE ISNO REASON WHY STRIPED BASS AQUACULTURE CANNOT GROW QUITE RAPIDLY, TO BECOME A THIRD MAJOR FORM OF PROFITABLE FISH CULTURE FOR THE U.S. IN THE 1990'S.",

THE PULSATILE HYDRAULIC OUTPUT IS DERIVED FROM A SMALLECCENTRIC DRIVING A SCOTCH CRANK THAT INTRUDES A PLUNGER INTO A CLOSED OIL VOLUME.

CASE-BASED REASONING IS A NEW APPROACH TO EXPERT SYSTEMS; COMPARED TO RULE-BASED SYSTEMS, CBR APPEARS TO BE A MORE EFFICIENT, SENSITIVE, AND EFFECTIVE STRATEGY TO DERIVE AND REPRESENT CRITICAL KNOWLEDGE. PHASE I WILL DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF A CBR APPROACH THAT USES TACTICAL FIRE CONTROL DECISION DATA FROM PREVIOUS EXERCISES AS THE BASIS FOR PREDICTIONS. STANDARD ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) APPROACHES RUN INTO THE DIFFICULTY OF HAVING TO MODEL THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE HARDWARE/SOFTWARE ELEMENTS ALONG WITH THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE HUMAN FACTORS. A CBR STRATEGY AVOID THIS PROBLEM BY RELYING ON MATCHES TO SIMILAR PROJECTS SO THAT IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO REPRESENT WORLD KNOWLEDGE. ADDITIONALLY, A CBR APPROACH OFFERS THE POSSIBILITY OF IMPROVING REAL-TIME PERFORMANCE CONSIDERABLY, SINCE A SIMILAR CASE REPRESENTING A NEAR SOLUTION CAN BE RETRIEVED RAPIDLY.",

REAL-TIME HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAYS HAVE LONG BEEN CONSIDERED IMPRACTICAL DUE TO THE EXTREMELY HIGH BANDWIDTH AND RESOLUTION REQUIREMENTS INVOLVED. THESE ARE BASED ON PAST ANALYSES OF CONVENTIONAL TRANSMISSION HOLOGRAMS, WHICH PROVIDE MUCH MORE INFORMATION THAN A HUMAN OBSERVER CAN USE. MORE RECENT STUDIES HAVE CONCLUDED THE INFORMATION CONTENT OF HOLOGRAMS CAN BE DRASTICALLY REDUCED WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT EFFECT UPON THE VISUAL IMPACT OF THE IMAGE. THE REQUIRED SPACE-BANDWIDTH PRODUCT CAN BE REDUCED TO THAT AVAILABLE WITH COMMERCIAL SPATIAL LIGHT MODULATORS BY PROGRESSIVELY SCANNING A SMALLER HOLOGRAM TO FILL OUT A 3-D VIEWING SPACE. BY UTILIZING EXISTING COMPUTER GRAPHICS TECHNOLOGY TO QUICKLY RENDER PERSPECTIVE VIEWS OF A THREE-DIMENSIONAL OBJECT IT SHOULD BECOME EASIER TO GENERATEHOLOGRAPHIC STEREOGRAMS IN REAL TIME RATHER THAN ATTEMPTING THE MORE DIFFICULT AND UNNECESSARY TASK OF DIRECTLY COMPUTING A \"REAL\" HOLOGRAM WITH DIFFRACTION-LIMITED RESOLUTION.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         WITH THE ADVENT OF LASERS IN COMMUNICATIONS, ONE TECHNIQUE THAT IS EMPLOYED IS DIRECT AMPLITUDE MODULATION OF THE SOURCE LASER WITH THE RF WAVE THAT ACTUALLY CARRIES THE INFORMATION OF INTEREST. DEMODULATION IS PERFORMED VIA DIRECT DETECTION OF THE RECEIVED BEAM FOR MANY SHORT-DISTANT COMMUNICATIONS. A LIMITATION ON THIS TECHNIQUE IS THE LINEARITY OF THE DIRECT MODULATION. THAT IS, THE AMPLITUDE OF THE OPTICAL CARRIER DOES NOT CORRESPOND TO THE AMPLITUDE OF THE INPUT RF IN A LINEAR FASHION. THIS NONLINEARITY CAN CAUSE DISTORTIONS, ESPECIALLY WHEN MANY CHANNELS ARE MULTIPLEXED IN THE RF PRIOR TO MODULATION. ONE METHOD TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM IS A LASER DIODE DEVELOPMENT EFFORT TO CREATE DIODES WITH THE APPROPRIATE LINEARITY (1 PART IN 10,000). THIS, HOWEVER, CAN BE VERY COSTLY AND CAN DELAY THIS COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY FROM FUTURE DEVELOPMENT. A MORE COST-EFFECTIVE CORRECTION IS TO USE PRESENT TECHNOLOGY IN DIODE DEVELOPMENT AND CREATE THE NECESSARY LINEARITY THROUGH ELECTRONIC FEEDBACK. SCIENCE, INC. PROPOSES THIS APPROACH, BASED ON TECHNOLOGY RELATED TO THE STABILITY OF LASER POWER OUTPUT. THIS PROPOSAL DISCUSSES A NOVEL METHOD WHEREBY COMMERCIALLY-AVAILABLE ELECTRO-OPTIC COMPONENTS CAN BE PACKAGED TO PRODUCE THE EFFECTS OF A LASER DIODE WITH OUTPUT LINEARITY OF 1 PART IN 10,000 AND A BANDWIDTH OF 10 MHZ. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - APPROPRIATE ELECTRO-OPTIC TECHNOLOGY ALONG WITH ELECTRONIC FEEDBACK OR FEEDFORWARD NETWORKS CAN PRODUCE THE APPROPRIATE MODULATION LINEARITY WITHOUT THE NEED FOR EXPENSIVE LASER DIODE DEVELOPMENT WORK. THEREFORE, THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL PROVIDE A COST-EFFECTIVE METHOD FOR CREATING FIBER OPTIC COMMUNICATION LINKS USING DIRECT DETECTION",

THE MOST EFFICIENT SCINTILLATION MATERIALS HAVE BEEN THE INORGANIC CRYSTAL SCINTILLATORS. NAL (T1) HAS BEEN THE MOST WIDELY USED MATERIAL AND HAS LED TO MANY IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES AND APPLICATIONS. HOWEVER, THIS MATERIAL DOES HAVE SEVERAL DISADVANTAGES IN THAT IT IS HYGROSCOPIC, HAS A LONG RADIATION LENGTH AND HAS POOR MECHANICAL PROPERTIES BAF2 OVERCOMES MOST OF THE SHORTCOMINGS OF NAL (T1). RECENTLY, POLYMER SCINTILLATION FIBERS HAVE SHOWN THAT FIBERS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE SIZE OF SCINTILLATION DETECTOR SYSTEMS AND CAN ALSO RESULT IN MUCH GREATER SPATIAL RESOLUTION. WE ARE PROPOSING TO DEVELOP SINGLE CRYSTAL FIBERS OF BAF2 USING THE LASER-HEATED PEDESTAL-GROWTH TECHNIQUE THAT LASERGENICS CORPORATION HAS LICENSED FROM STANFORD UNIVERSITY. THESE FIBERS WILL HAVE MUCH GREATER EFFICIENCIES THAN THE POLYMER FIBERS THAT HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED AND WILL HAVE EVEN HIGHER RESOLUTION. THIS COULD LEAD TO MUCH SIMPLER AND CHEAPER DETECTION SYSTEMS FORNUCLEAR PHYSICS EXPERIMENTS.",

THE GAME'S VALUE IS THAT IT COMMUNICATES IMPORTANT COMPLEX NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION IN A FORMAT APPEALING TO CHILDREN. IN OCTOBER OF 1987, THE NATIONAL CHOLESTEROL EDUCATION PROGRAM AND THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH ESTABLISHED NEW RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DIET MODIFICATION, ESPECIALLY REDUCTION OF SATURATED FAT AND CHOLESTEROL INTAKE.

THE PROPOSED SOURCE, WHEN COMPLETED, WILL PROVIDE NEW CAPABILITIES IN SPECTRAL PURITY, PULSE DURATION VERSATILITY, PULSE ENERGY AND RELIABILITY. PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY, WHEN AUGMENTED BY NONLINEAR CONVERSION METHODS BASED ON STIMULATED RAMAN SCATTERING (SRS) AND SECOND AND THIRD HARMONIC GENERATION, A GENERAL LIGHT SOURCE USEFUL FOR CHEMICAL APPLICATIONS WILLBECOME AVAILABLE THAT PROVIDES ENORMOUS COST BENEFITS, RELIABILITY AND OPERATING SIMPLICITY OVER PREVIOUS TECHNOLOGY. THIS SOURCE, WE BELIEVE, WILL GREATLY IMPROVE THE AMOUNT OF TIME RESEARCHERS CAN SPEND ON PERFORMING EXPERIMENTS RATHER THAN MAINTAINING LASERS AND WILL PERMIT MULTI LASER EXPERIMENTS TO BE PERFORMED VASTLY MORE EASILY AND AT MANY MORE LABORATORIES THAN IS POSSIBLE TODAY.",

A MENS OF ASSOCIATING THE INTERCEPTED PULSE TRAIN WITH A \"KNOWN\" EMITTER. USE OF UNINTENTIONAL MODULATION ON PULSES (UMOP) AS A SORT PARAMETER CAN PROVIDE BETTER SIGNAL RECOGNITION AND BETTER PARAMETER MEASUREMENTS AND LOCATION COMPUTATIONS THROUGH GENERATION OF MORE VALID ASSOCIATIONS WITH \"KNOWN\" EMITTER PULSE TRAINS AND, THEREFORE BETTER RECOGNITION OF INTERCEPTED SIGNALS. ACCORDINGLY, A PHASE I STUDY IS PROPOSED TO INVESTIGATE THREE APPROACHES TO THE MEASUREMENT AND CHARACTERIZATION OF UMOP, EACH ENTAILING THE GENERATION OF DIGITIZED DESCRIPTIONS OF INTERCEPTED PULSED SIGNALS FOR COMPARISON AGAINST DIGITAL DESCRIPTORS STORED IN A SIGNAL LIBRARY. THESE THREE APPROACHES INCLUDE: FOURIER FREQUENCY SPECTRAL ANALYSIS, PULSE SHAPE, AND PULSE SHAPE IN COMBINATION WITH FM DETECTOR RESPONSE. SPECIAL EMPHASIS WILL BE APPLIED TO THE PROBLEMS OF UMOP DISTORTION FROM SIMULTANEOUS PULSE RECEPTION AND MULTIPATH RECEPTION. SAMPLING RATES, TIME, FREQUENCY, AND AMPLITUDE QUANTIZATION STEPS NECESSARY FOR THE THREE APPROACHES WILL BE ANALYZED AND RECOMMENDATIONS MADE ON THE BEST COMPROMISE OF RESULTS, COST, COMPLEXITY, AND DESIGN RISK WITH A BLOCK DIAGRAM AND SPECIFICATION FOR THE RECOMMENDED APPROACH TO A UMOP PULSEASSOCIATED POST RECEIVER.",

THE SENSOR WOULD BE USED TO MEASURE (1) BLOOD OR TISSUE TEMPERATURE; (2) BLOOD PRESSURE; AND (3) LOCAL HEAT FLOW, AIR FLOW, OR BLOOD FLOW FOR VARIOUS CLINICAL APPLICATIONS. IN THIS PROJECT, HOWEVER, THE TARGETAPPLICATION IS ANGIOPLASTY. BECAUSE THE TEMPERATURE- AND FLOW-SENSING COMBINATION HAS ALREADY BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN EARLIER STUDIES, THIS PHASE I RESEARCH WILL CONCENTRATE ON THE COMBINATION OF TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE SENSING. IN PHASE II, THE PROVEN BLOOD-FLOW MEASUREMENT CAPABILITY WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO THE SYSTEM, FORMING A FINAL SENSOR THAT IS CAPABLE OF MEASURING ALL THREE PARAMETERS SIMULTANEOUSLY. A SUCCESSFUL PHASE I PROGRAM WILL PRODUCE PROTOTYPES MADE WITH A SINGLE OPTICAL FIBER CARRYING BOTH THE TEMPERATURE- AND PRESSURE-SENSING ELEMENTS. THE RESULTING PROBE WILL HAVE A MAXIMUM DIAMETER OF 1 MM, WITH POTENTIAL FOR FURTHER SIZE REDUCTION TO 0.5 MM. THE PROTOTYPES WILL BE TESTED TO DETERMINE PERFORMANCE CAPABILITIES RELATIVE TO ANGIOPLASTY.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         A NEW PROCESS IS PRESENTED WHEREBY ELECTRONICALLY CONDUCTINGPOLYMERS ARE SYNTHESIZED USING PHOTOCHEMICAL, RATHER THAN ELECTROCHEMICAL OR CHEMICAL, MEANS. THE PROCESS INVOLVES ILLUMINATION OF AN AQUEOUS SOLUTION CONTAINING PYRROLE AND AN ELECTRON ACCEPTOR WITH ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT. ABSORPTIONOF THE LIGHT INDUCES ELECTRON TRANSFER FROM THE PYRROLE TO THE ELECTRON ACCEPTOR, THEREBY PROMOTING POLYMERIZATION OF THE OXIDIZED PYRROLE MONOMER. THE RESULTANT POLYMER IS AHIGHLY CONDUCTING FILM WHICH ADHERES STRONGLY TO THE SUBSTRATE. THE PROCESS IS FAST, SIMPLE, AND ALLOWS THE DEPOSITION OF CONDUCTING POLYMER FILMS ONTO NON-CONDUCTING SUBSTRATES. PHOTOPOLYMERIZATION OF ELECTRONICALLY CONDUCTING POLYMERS WOULD BE USEFUL FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF ELECTROCHROMIC DISPLAYS, RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES, ELECTROCHEMICAL SENSORS, AND FOR ELECTROMAGNETIC SHIELDING. THESE APPLICATIONS HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN PROPOSED FOR CONDUCTING POLYMERS, BUT CURRENT METHODS OF SYNTHESIS ARE NOT AMENABLE TO INDUSTRIAL SCALE MANUFACTURE. THE RESEARCH PLAN OUTLINES AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE SYNTHESIS OF ELECTRONICALLY CONDUCTING POLYMERS BY PHOTOPOLYMERIZATION, IN ADDITION TO A CHARACTERIZATION OF THE PROPERTIES OF PHOTO-DEPOSITED CONDUCTING POLYMERS WITH RESPECT TO THEIR CONDUCTIVITY, ADHERANCE TO THE SUBSTRATE, AND THEIR STABILITY.",

UTILIZATION OF SOLAR ENERGY IN THE BIOCATALYTIC APPROACH TO WATER SPLITTING IS ATTRACTIVE ECONOMICALLY, SINCE THE LIGHT-HARVESTING MECHANISM AND THE ACTIVE REDOX CENTERS FOR WATER SPLITTING EXIST IN HIGHER PLANTS AND ALGAE. HOWEVER, SYSTEMS FOR THE BIOPRODUCTION OF HYDROGEN ARE IMPRACTICAL, FOR AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING REASONS: (A) THE PHOTOSYSTEMS OF ISOLATED PLANT (THYLAKOID) MEMBRANES BECOME INACTIVE AFTER A SHORT PERIOD; (B) HYDROGEN PRODUCTION IS OFTEN DEPENDENT UPON HIGHLY OXYGEN-SENSITIVE ENZYMES (E.G., HYDROGENASES), AND (C) SOME PHOTOBIOLOGICAL HYDROGEN-PRODUCING SYSTEMS DEPEND UPON ELECTRON TRANSFER RELAYS, SUCH AS METHYL VIOLOGEN, THAT ARE AUTO-OXIDIZABLE AND LIGHT-SENSITIVE. THE GOAL OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WORK IS TO UTILIZE A SINGLE TECHNIQUE TO OVERCOME THESE BASIC PROBLEMS THAT RESTRICT THE USE OF BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS AS PHOTOCATALYTIC SYSTEMS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN FROM WATER. IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE HAVE DESCRIBED THE PRINCIPAL FOR, AND THE BASICSTEPS REQUIRED TO, TEST THE FEASIBILITY OF DEPOSITING LOW AMOUNTS OF METALLIC PT DIRECTLY ONTO THE PHOTOSYNTHETIC MEMBRANES OF INTACT CELLS OF BLUE-GREEN ALGAE AS A MEANS OF ACHIEVING A LOW-COST PHOTOCATALYTIC MATERIAL WITH LONG-TERM STABILITY.",

THE ANALYSIS REFLECTS A SMALL SENSITIVITY TO VOLTAGE CHANGES CLOSE TO THE MAXIMUM POWER POINT, GAINS IN THE FUEL CELL BEING COMPENSATED BY LOSSES IN STORAGE AND VICE VERSA. IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT ANY FUEL CELL USED IN THIS APPLICATION MUST BE USED AT HIGH POWER DENSITY, AND THE ENSEMBLE MUST BE OPTIMIZED AROUND THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FUEL CELL. IN PARTICULAR, THE FUEL CELL MUST BE LIGHT WEIGHT IN KG/M2, BUT MORE PARTICULARLY SHOULD OPERATE AT THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE CURRENT DENSITY TO MAKE 2 KW/KG FOR THE SYSTEM A REALITY. FUEL CELL RUGGEDNESS AND REALIABILITY WILL BE MOST IMPORTANT. FUEL CELL EFFICIENCY IS LESS IMPORTANT. FOR THIS REASON, THE USE OF THE PEM FUEL CELL WITH IMPROVED MEMBRANES (DOW CHEMICAL, POLYIMIDE AND CARBANION ACID POLYMERS) IS PROPOSED.

THE DOMINANT PROCESS FOR TOXIC WASTE TREATMENT, SPECIFICALLY CHLOROCARBONS, HAS BEEN INCINERATION. THE INTOLERABLE QUANTITIES OF POLYCHLORINATEDHALOCARBONS (PCHC) DETECTED IN EFFLUENT OF INCINERATORS HAVERAISED SERIOUS CONCERNS AS OF THE WIDE APPLICATION OF THIS TECHNOLOGY. UTILIZATION OF A REDUCING ATMOSPHERE CAN DRAMATICALLY DECREASE THE CONCENTRATIONS OF PCHC IN THE EMISSION, BUT IT CREATES UNACCEPTABLE AMOUNTS OF SOLID CARBON. WE PROPOSE A NOVEL METHOD FOR SAFE CONVERSION OF HALOCARBONSTHAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ALLEVIATE THESE PROBLEMS. THIS METHOD INVOLVES A PHOTO-INITIATED REACTION BETWEEN CHLORINATED HYDROCARBONS (C1HC) AND METHANE (OR HYDROGEN) TOPRODUCE CHLORINE-FREE HYDROCARBONS AND HCL. THE PROCESS WILL BE CONDUCTED AT TEMPERATURES BELOW 600 K. THIS WILL CIRCUMVENT SOOT FORMATION WHICH IS CHARACTERISTIC OF HIGHER TEMPERATURE THERMAL PROCESSES AND WILL SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE ENERGY COST. PHASE I WILL BE AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WITH FIVE TASKS: CONSTRUCTION OF A VERSATILE PHOTOCHEMICAL APPARATUS, PHOTOLYSIS OF CH2C12/CH4, CH2C12/H2 MIXTURES AND ANALYSIS OF PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION, DETERMINATION OF BEST (HIGHEST CONVERSION) SOOT FREE CONDITION, EXTENSION OF PHOTOLYSIS AND PRODUCTS ANALYSIS TO OTHER CHLOROCARBONS (CHC13, C2H4C12), AND FINALLY INVESTIGATION OF THE IMPORTANT PROCESSPARAMETERS. PHASE I WILL PROVIDE A TECHNICAL FOUNDATION FORPHASE II R & D ON A PROTOTYPE REACTOR TO CONVERT UBIQUITOUS INDUSTRIAL WASTE.",

WHEN AIR IS USED AS A SOURCE OF OXIDANT, THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT GAS DUE TO DILUENTS SUCH AS CO2 AND/OR N2 REDUCES THE PRODUCT GAS QUALITY AND INCREASES THE VOLUME OF GAS THAT MUST BE CLEANED AND PROCESSED. WHEN OXYGEN IS USED, REQUIREMENTS FOR AIR SEPARATION FACILITIES SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES THE CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS. IN THE MTCI INDIRECT GASIFICATION PROCESS, THE HEAT FOR THE ENDOTHERMIC GASIFICATION REACTION IS PROVIDED THROUGH A HEAT EXCHANGER. SINCE THE PRODUCT GAS DOES NOT MIX WITH THE COMBUSTION FLUE,THE PRODUCT GAS IS OF HIGH QUALITY CONTAINING ESSENTIALLY COAND H2. THIS SYNTHESIS GAS IS IDEAL FOR USE WITH \"INDIRECT LIQUEFACTION\" PROCESSES OR AS A SOURCE OF CHEMICAL FEEDSTOCK.

THE PROCESS ISA RELATIVELY LOW-TEMPERATURE (1250 F) PROCESS WHICH INHIBITSTHE FORMATION OF CHLORINATED DIOXINS AND FURANS AS WELL AS THE CONDENSATION OF METALS UPON FLY ASH NORMALLY ENCOUNTEREDINCONVENTIONAL INCINERATORS. THE WASTE-TO-ENERGY PROCESS PRODUCES A HYDROGEN RICH GAS OF MEDIUM BTU CONTENT CLOSE TO NATURAL GAS. THE REDUCTION IN SOLID WASTE IS ANTICIPATED TOBE GREATER THAN 70% WITH CHARACTERISTICS CONSIDERABLY MORE BENIGN THAN POWER PLANT ASH. THE PHASE I EFFORT IS FOCUSED UPON A SERIES OF FEASIBILITY TESTS UTILIZING WASTEWATER SLUDGE, RDF AND/OR MSW IN ITS EXISTING PILOT-SCALE REACTOR, PROCESSING THE WASTE AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO INCINERATION. THESE TESTS WILL ALSO PROVIDE A CHARACTERIZATION AND DISPOSITION OF THE CHEMICAL SPECIES FROM THE FEEDSTOCK IN THE PRODUCT STREAMS OF THE STEAM REFORMER, E.G., PRODUCT GAS AND SOLID WASTE RESIDUES.",

IN THIS PROPOSAL WE DESCRIBED THE SYSTEM TRADE ISSUES THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR DEVELOPING SUCH A SYSTEM. THE MAJOR ISSUES ARE SIGNAL FIDELITY AND HOW THE SIGNAL GENERATOR SHOULD BE INTERFACED TO THE RADAR SYSTEM UNDER TEST. SINCE THE INTERFACE IS LIKELY TO BE IN AN ANALOG FORMAT AT SOME IF OR RF, THE DIGITAL SIGNALS WILL PROBABLY BE CONVERTED TO ANALOG. IN THE PAST, SUCH CONVERSION HAS BEEN A PROBLEM WITH COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE HARDWARE. HOWEVER, WE DESCRIBED A NEW DIGITAL QUADRATURE MODULATION TECHNIQUE THAT OVERCOMES SUCH PROBLEMS; THE TECHNIQUE IS CAPABLE OF SUPPRESSING ALL SPURIOUS COMPONENTS TO WELL BELOW -60 DB, WHICH IS REQUIREMENT OF MODERN COHERENT RADARS. MOST THREAT RADAR SIMULATORS ARE OF GROUND BASED RADARS.

WE PROPOSE TO PROCESS MONOLITHIC MOSI2 WITH ULTRAFINE GRAIN SIZE (1MUM)STABILIZED BY AN UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION OF ULTRAFINE (0.01-0.1MUM) HFC DISPERSOIDS WHICH WILL EXHIBIT SUPERPLASTIC FORMABILITY. THE APPROACH THAT IS PROPOSED IS TO PROCESS MOSI2 WITH APPROPRIATE MICROSTRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS TO INDUCE SUPERPLASTICITY. THE ULTRAFINE GRAIN SIZE IN MOSI2 PROCESSED VIA ADVANCED MELT SPINNING WILL SHOW ENHANCED STRAIN RATE SENSITIVITY LEADING TO SUPERPLASTIC FLOW. THE UNIFORMLY DISTRIBUTED ULTRAFINE HFC DISPERSOIDS WILL RETAIN THE FINE GRAIN SIZE AS WELL AS INHIBIT CAVITATION DURING SUPERPLASTIC FLOW BY VARIOUS RECOVERY MECHANISMS OCCURRING IN THE VICINITY OF THESE INCOHERENT PARTICLES. SUCH A MICROSTRUCTURE WILL LEAD TO ENHANCEMENT OF GRAIN-BOUNDARY SLIDING AND INHIBITION OF SLIP CREEP LEADING TO EASY SUPERPLASTIC FLOW. WE WILL EXAMINE THE MICROSTRUCTURES TO DETERMINE THE GRAIN SIZE AND THE SIZE, GEOMETRY, COMPOSITION AND DISTRIBUTION OFTHE DISPERSOIDS AS WELL AS THE DISLOCATION STRUCTURE USING TEM.

THE PROPOSED RESEARCH AIMS TO ACHIEVE OPTIMUM ROOM AND ELEVATED TEMPERATURE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES BY IN-SITU DEVELOPMENT OF A CRITICAL VOLUME FRACTION OF HIGH ASPECT RATIO BORIDE REINFORCEMENTS OF SIZE >10 MICROMETERS IN A FINE GRAINED (<10 MICROMETERS) GAMMA-TIAL MATRIX BY RAPID SOLIDIFICATION AND POWDER METALLURGICAL PROCESSING. BASED ON CONTINUUM MECHANICS CONSIDERATIONS, IMPROVE CREEP RESISTANCE IS EXPECTED FROM BORIDE REINFORCEMENTS. IMPROVED DUCTILITY IS EXPECTED FROM THE FINE GRAIN SIZE OF THE GAMMA-TIAL MATRIX BECAUSE OF THE REDUCED SLIP LENGTH AND THE LOWER STRESS CONCENTRATION AT THE GRAIN BOUNDARIES.

MARTEK CORPORATION HAS RECENTLY IDENTIFIED A MICROALGAL ISOLATE IN ITS CULTURE COLLECTION (MK8908) THAT IS A NATURAL OVERPRODUCER OF SQD AND HAS OPTIMIZED ITS GROWTH SUCH THAT THE SQD PRODUCTIVITY IS ABOUT 200-250 MG/LITER/DAY (1,000-FOLD HIGHER THAN THE BLUE-GREEN MICROALGAE). DURING PHASE I, IT IS PLANNED TO SCREEN OVER 250 MUTANT ISOLATES OF THIS ORGANISM FOR SQD PRODUCTIVITY, TO MANIPULATE THE GROWTH CONDITIONS OF A SINGLE STRAIN AND DETERMINE WHICH PARAMETERS INFLUENCE SQD PRODUCTION, AND TO PRODUCE 20 GRAMS OF PURIFIED SDQ FOR NCI RESEARCHERS USING THE OPTIMIZED CONDITIONS.

THIS RECEPTOR IS A CRITICAL TRIGGER MOLECULE FOR ADCC BY THESE CELLS. THIS RESEARCH WILL DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF USING THE MAB TO THIS RECEPTOR IN CONJUNCTIONWITH MABS TO HIV ANTIGENS TO KILL HIV-INFECTED CELLS. STUDIES HAVE INDICATED THAT THIS APPROACH PERMITS LYSIS OF TUMOR CELL TARGETS. IN THIS PROJECT, STUDIES WILL DEMONSTRATE THAT BI-SPECIFIC ANTIBODIES COMPOSED OF MAB TO TRIGGER MOLECULES ON MYELOID CELLS COUPLED TO ANTIBODIES REACTIVE TO THE HIV GP120 ANTIGEN CAN MEDIATE KILLING OF CELLS EXPRESSING GP120 BY HUMAN MONOCYTES, MACROPHAGES, AND/OR GRANULOCYTES. THE SPECIFIC AIMS ARE TO INVESTIGATE, USING THESE BI-SPECIFIC ANTIBODIES, WHETHER ANTI-FC RI MABS, WHEN COUPLED TO ANTI-GP120 MAB, MEDIATE: (1) KILLING BY HUMAN MONOCYTES OF THE CELL LINES EXPRESSING THE HIV GP120; (2) ENHANCED KILLING OF GP120-EXPRESSING CELLS IF THE MONOCYTES ARE FIRSTACTIVATED BY CYTOKINES; AND (3) KILLING OF THESE GP120-EXPRESSING CELLS BY OTHER HUMAN MYELOID CELLS, BEFORE OR AFTER ACTIVATION BY CYTOKINES. THE STUDIES WILL FOCUS ON THE ABILITY OF MONOCYTES AND PMNS TARGETED THROUGH FC RI TO MEDIATE KILLING OF CELLS EXPRESSING THE GP120 ANTIGEN AS A PRELUDE TO STUDIES OF CYTOTOXICITY OF HIVAND HIV-INFECTED CELLS.",

THIS SHORTFALL HAS A GROWING INFLUENCE, ESPECIALLY IN THE TESTING OF ADHESIVE REPAIRS TO COMPOSITE STRUCTURES AS THE USE OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS PROLIFERATE. PROPERLY PERFORMED, ADHESIVE REPAIRS ARE BETTER THAN MECHANICAL REPAIRS IN SUCH STRUCTURES (KELLY, 1984). THE PRESENT PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THE PROBLEM OF BOND TESTING WITH A NEW METHOD THAT IS ESPECIALLY SUITABLE FOR HIGH SPEED SCREENING OF BONDED STRUCTURES.

A VACCINE FOR IMMUNIZATION AGAINST B19 VIRUS INFECTION IS URGENTLY NEEDED IN CERTAIN OF THESE SITUATIONS, BUT, IN OTHERS, IMMUNOGLOBULIN THERAPY MAY PROVE A MORE FEASIBLE AND APPROPRIATE STRATEGY. CURRENT COMMERCIAL IMMUNOGLOBULIN PREPARATIONS ARE GENERALLY A GOOD SOURCE OF ANTI-B19 VIRUS ANTIBODIES; HOWEVER, FOR EFFECTIVE THERAPY, EXTREMELY HIGH DOSES ARE REQUIRED.

THE USE OF GAMMAGLOBULIN ONLY FROM DONORS WITH HIGH-TITER PARVOVIRUS-NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES WOULD GREATLY ADVANCE THE THERAPEUTIC BENEFIT OF THIS APPROACH. UNFORTUNATELY, THE CURRENT ASSAY FOR B19 VIRUS NEUTRALIZATION IS NOT AMENABLE TO SCREENING LARGE NUMBERS OF HUMAN SERA FOR IDENTIFICATION OF APPROPRIATE PLASMA DONORS. THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP A RAPID AND FACILE SCREENING TEST THAT WILL CORRELATE WITH THE PRESENCE OF HIGH-LEVEL B19 VIRUS-NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES IN HUMAN SERA. A VARIETY OF SUCH ELISA-FORMATTED ASSAYS WILL BE DEVELOPED AND EVALUATED. THE RESULTING SURROGATE NEUTRALIZATION TEST WILL IDENTIFY APPROPRIATE PLASMA DONORS POSSESSING POTENT B19 VIRUS-NEUTRALIZING ACTIVITY; PLASMAPHERESIS OF THESE INDIVIDUALS WILL YIELD PLASMA POOLS FOR HYPERIMMUNE GLOBULIN PRODUCTION.

CURRENTLY, THERE ARE AN ESTIMATED 350+ MILLION ACUTE CASES WORLDWIDE EACH YEAR, AND APPROXIMATELY 1 TO 2 MILLION INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN DIE IN AFRICA ALONE BECAUSE OF THE DISEASE. TRADITIONAL METHODS OF CONTROLLING MALARIA WITH INSECTICIDES AND DRUGS HAVE BEEN INADEQUATE. THUS, INCREASED ATTENTION HAS FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE VACCINE AGAINST THE PARASITE. THE OBJECTIVE OF PHASE I IS TO ASSESS THE PROTECTIVE EFFICACY OF IMMUNIZATION WITH RECOMBINANT MYCOBACTERIAL (E.G., BCG) VACCINES CONTAINING THE GENE FROM THE MAJOR SURFACE PROTEIN OF MALARIA SPOROZOITES WITH THE GOAL OF INDUCING PROTECTIVE CELL-MEDIATED IMMUNITY. A PLASMODIUM BERGHEI RODENT MALARIA MODEL WILL BE UTILIZED AS NO RELIABLE ANIMAL MODEL IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR THE HUMAN MALARIA PARASITES. P. FALCIPARUM AND P. VIVAX. DATA FROM THIS STUDY WILL BE USED TO ESTABLISH PRINCIPLES THAT CAN BE APPLIED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL VACCINE CANDIDATES FOR THE HUMAN MALARIA PARASITES. THIS APPROACH IS OF SPECIAL INTEREST BECAUSE BCG IS CURRENTLY USED FOR VACCINATION IN THE WHO/EXPANDED PROGRAM FOR IMMUNIZATION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WHERE MALARIA IS ENDEMIC.",

THESESEALS MUST BE ABLE TO STAND THE HIGH PRESSURES AND MUST BE DESIGNED TO PREVENT LARGE CRYOGEN SPILLS IN VERY CONFINED SPACES. WE PROPOSE, THEREFORE, TO DESIGN AN EFFICIENT VACUUM INSULATED OVERLAP FITTING THAT WILL SEAL AGAINST THE HIGH PRESSURES, THAT WILL PREVENT THE POSSIBILITY OF CRYOGEN SPILLS AND WILL BE SAFE TO OPERATE IN THE CONFINED ENVIRONMENT OF AN ACCELERATOR TUNNEL. WE PROPOSE TO DESIGN IN INTERLOCKS AND RELIEF MECHANISMS INTO THIS CRYOGENIC BAYONET FITTING BUT THESE COMPLEXITIES WILL NOT INTERFERE WITH THE EASE OF OPERATION BY THE TECHNICIAN. ALTHOUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS FITTING WILL FULFILL A DIRENEED FOR THE SUPERCONDUCTING SUPERCOLLIDER, WE FORSEE ITS APPLICATION IN MANY NEW INNOVATIONS IN COMMERCIAL APPLIED CRYOGENICS.

THE PROPOSAL PRESENTS AN APPROACH WHICH WOULD EMPLOY HIGH THROUGHPUT 32 BIT DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSORS, ARRAY PROCESSORS WITH UP TO 80 MFLOP EXECUTION RATES, A/D CONVERTERS WITH INTERNAL MULTIPLEXING, AND HIGH DENSITY, MULTI-PORT MEMORY CHIPS FOR PRODUCING A HIGH THROUGHPUT, YET PROGRAMMABLE, DIGITAL BEAMFORMER THAT IS VME BUS COMPATIBLE. TO AUGMENT THE HARDWARE, IT IS PROPOSED THAT THE LATEST TECHNIQUES DEVELOPED BY THE NAVY FOR MAXIMIZING HARDWARE THROUGHPUT ON ITS STANDARD REAL-TIME SIGNAL PROCESSORS BE APPLIED TO TAILOR THE SIGNAL PROCESSING ALGORITHMS TO THE HARDWARE. USING DATA FLOW PROGRAMMING TECHNIQUES AND SPECIAL PURPOSE ALGORITHMS, THE OVERHEAD ASSOCIATED WITH PROGRAMMABLE APPLICATIONS CAN BE MINIMIZED, THEREBY MAXIMIZING THE PROCESSING THROUGHPUT.

THE PRIMARY EXPERIMENTAL OBJECTIVE IS TO CREATE A SET OF SHORT SYNTHETIC OLIGODEOXYNUCLEOTIDE PROBES THAT WILL HYBRIDIZE SPECIFICALLY WITH THE 16S RRNA OF C. ALBICANS. SPECIFICITY WILL BE VERIFIED BY HYBRIDIZATION OF EACH (32)P-LABELED PROBE TO SLOT BLOT FILTERS CONTAINING NUCLEIC ACID SAMPLES FROM OVER 50 MICROORGANISMS THAT ARE FOUND FREQUENTLY IN THE OROPHARYNX. FURTHERMORE, THE (32)-LABELEDPROBES WILL BE USED TO MEASURE LEVELS OF C. ALBICANS IN SAMPLES FROM IMMUNOCOMPROMISED PATIENTS. PROBE RESULTS WILL BE COMPARED WITH CONVENTIONAL DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATIONS OF CANDIDIASIS IN THESE SAME PATIENTS. DURING PHASE II OF THIS PROJECT, THESE PROBES WILL BE USED TO DEVELOP A RAPID COLORIMETRIC ASSAY FOR DETECTING AND MONITORING C. ALBICANS IN PERSONS AT HIGH RISK FOR DEVELOPING ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME (AIDS). THE FINAL PRODUCT WILL BE A QUANTITATIVE TEST FOR THE CLINICAL LABORATORY THAT CAN BE PERFORMED WITHIN 3 HOURS OR LESS AT ROOM TEMPERATURE AND THAT CAN BE USED AS AN ALTERNATIVE FOR THE MUCH LENGTHIER PROCEDURE OF CULTURING FOR C. ALBICANS.",

PHASE I OF THE PROJECT FOCUSES ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS FOR IRASS AND THE COMPLETION OF A LIMITED COMPUTER-BASED DEMONSTRATION. DURING PHASE II, A COMPLETE PROTOTYPE WILL BE DEVELOPED AND FIELD-TESTED. THE SYSTEM ADDRESSES THE NEED FOR SIMPLIFIED RISK ASSESSMENTMETHODS, AUTOMATED CASE MANAGEMENT SUPPORT, ON-THE-JOB TRAINING, AND ON-DEMAND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO WORKERS, WHILE PROVIDING IMPROVED ACCOUNTABILITY AND PRODUCTIVITY WITHIN CPS AGENCIES.",

THE TYPES OF ACT TECHNOLOGY TO BE EXPLOITED IN THIS DEVELOPMENT ARE TUNABLE FILTERS WITH PROGRAMMABLE BANDWIDTHS AND ADJUSTABLE DELAY LINES FOR DELAY LINE DISCRIMINATORS. A VERY LONG DELAY USING ACT TECHNOLOGY WILL ALSO BE INVESTIGATED. THIS ADAPTIVE RECEIVER BUILDS UPON PREVIOUS RECEIVER DESIGNS BY DEVELOPING A NEW APPROACH TO THE RECEIVER ARCHITECTURE. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF ESM/ELINT RECEIVER TECHNOLOGY IS INTENDED TO BE USED WITH RECONNAISSANCE AND SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS TO BE DEPLOYED IN THE 1995-2010 TIME FRAME. THESE SYSTEMS WILL BE EMPLOYED ON VARIOUS RECONNAISSANCE PLATFORMS, AGAINST A VARIETY OF AIR, GROUND, AND SEA TARGETS. THE ESM/ELINT SYSTEM IS INTENDED TO DETECT, LOCATE, AND RECOGNIZE THREATS LIKELY TO BE ENCOUNTERED IN SUPPORT OF COUNTER-NARCOTIC OPERATIONS AND LOW INTENSITY CONFLICT AREAS. THE ESM/ELINT RECEIVER SYSTEM IS CAPABLE OF AUTONOMOUS, REAL TIME TARGET EXPLOITATION AND ANALYSIS OF THE ESM/ELINT DATA. ACT TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES THE UNIQUE REAL TIME TUNING AND FAST SIGNAL MEASUREMENT CAPABILITY REQUIRED BY THIS APPLICATION. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/ POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - THIS EFFORT IS EXPECTED TO YIELD A SOLID FOUNDATION FOR DEVELOPMENT OF HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS OF ACT DEVICES. THE REQUIREMENTS DEVELOPED FOR THESE SUB-SYSTEMS MAY INDIVIDUALLY OR AS A WHOLE BE USED AS A METRIC MEASUREMENT FOR EXPECTED PERFORMANCE. THE RESULTS OF THE DETERMINATION OF THE REQUIRED MEASUREMENT ASSETS AND PROCESSING REQUIREMENTS WILL BUILD A FRAMEWORK FOR A PHASED DEVELOPMENT OF A FULLY OPERATIONAL SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES THE FLEXIBILITY NEEDED ON VARIOUS INTERCEPT PLATFORMS.

WHEN THE BEAM CROSSES THE CAVITY OF PROPER DIMENSIONS, IT WILL INTERACT WITH A SINGLE CAVITY MODE THEREBY RADIATING COHERENTLY AT THE MODE'S FREQUENCY. MODE GROWTH CONTINUES UNABATED UNTIL THE RF FIELDS ARE LARGE ENOUGH TO MODIFY THE BEAM OPTIMIZED DISPERSION CHARACTERISTICS AND SATURATION IS REACHED. THE SATURATED RF POTENTIAL CAN BE SEVERAL TIMES THE ORIGINAL BEAM VOLTAGE. THIS POWERFUL MECHANISM MAY BE USED FOR PRODUCING HIGH POWER RF RADIATION,BUNCHING THE BEAM, OR AMPLIFYING AN EXISTING RF SIGNAL BY SEVERAL ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE. IN THIS PROPOSED EFFORT, THIS MECHANISM WILL BE INVESTIGATED AS AN EFFICIENT MEANS FOR RF AMPLIFICATION. FIRST, THE BEST MODE WILL BE IDENTIFIED BASED ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DESIRED ACCELERATING FIELD AND FREQUENCY. NEXT, THE BEAM PARAMETERS AND THE CAVITY CONFIGURATION WILL BE IDENTIFIED AND OPTIMIZED AND FINALLY, A PROOF-OF-PRINCIPLE EXPERIMENT WILL BE DESIGNED. TRANSIT-TIME AMPLIFIERS DO NOT NEED AN EXTERNAL MAGNETIC FIELD AND, AS SUCH, ARE VERY COMPACT AND ECONOMICAL. FURTHERMORE, BASED ON OUR PRELIMINARY STUDIES, POSSIBILITY FOR FOIL-LESS DIODE DESIGN EXISTS THEREBY ALLOWING PULSE REPETITION RATES OF SEVERAL HUNDRED TIMES PER SECOND. IN TRANSIT-TIME AMPLIFIERS THE INPUT RF SIGNAL WILL TRIGGER THE GROWTH. AS SUCH, THE OUTPUT WILL BE PHASE-LOCKED TO THE INPUT. THE PHASE STABILITY OF THE AMPLIFIER WILL BE VERIFIED.",

ALARMING AS IT MAY BE, MOST DOMESTIC WATER SUPPLIES DO NOT HAVE CONTINUOUS, ON-LINE MONITORING OF ORGANIC CONTENT. THE CONVENTIONAL MEASURE OF ORGANIC CONTENT IS TOTAL ORGANIC CARBON (TOC), INSTRUMENTS FOR WHICHARE COSTLY, REQUIRE FREQUENT MAINTENANCE BY SKILLED TECHNICIANS, AND PROVIDE ONLY PERIODIC ANALYSIS OF GRAB SAMPLES. WE PROPOSE HEREIN A NEW MEASURE FOR ORGANIC CONTENT OF AQUEOUS STREAMS: THE HEAT OF COMBUSTION OF ORGANIC CONSTITUENTS, DELTA H(C). TO A FIRST APPROXIMATION, DELTA H(C) IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE CARBON CONTENT (42 + 12 KJ/G C). WE PROPOSE AN INNOVATIVE METHOD TO MEASURE DELTA H(C): ORGANICS ARE CONVERTED TO VOLATILE COMPONENTS IN A PROPRIETARY PROCESS THAT PRESERVES THE HEAT OF COMBUSTION. THE VOLATILES ARE AIR-STRIPPED FROM THE WATER AND CATALYTICALLY OXIDIZED. THE TEMPERATURE RISE UPONOXIDATION PROVIDES A MEANS TO BACK-CALCULATE DELTA H(C), AND THEREBY, ORGANIC CONTENT. THIS METHOD DOES NOT REQUIRE EXPENDABLE CHEMICALS AND CAN BEMADE TO BE CONTINUOUS USING VERY SIMPLE EQUIPMENT AND INSTRUMENTATION. UNATTENDED OPERATION IN REMOTE LOCATIONS APPEARS TO BE FEASIBLE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PHASE I PROPOSAL IS TO DEMONSTRATE PROOF OF CONCEPT OF THIS PROPOSED ANALYTICAL METHOD.",

BECAUSE THE ELECTRON TRANSFER MEDIATORS ARE COVALENTLY ATTACHED TO AN INSOLUBLE POLYMER AND CANNOT DIFFUSE AWAY FROM THE ELECTRODE, THESE SENSORS SHOULD BE SUITABLE FOR IMPLANTATION AND THUS WOULD BE USEFUL FOR IN VIVO NEUROCHEMICAL RESEARCH. PHASE I RESEARCH WILL DEVELOP THESE SENSORS, USING THE FOLLOWING APPROACH: CONSTRUCT REDOX POLYMER-MODIFIED SENSORSCONTAINING ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE AND CHOLINE OXIDASE (FOR ACETYLCHOLINE DETECTION), L-GLUTAMATE OXIDASE (FOR GLUTAMATEDETECTION), AND L-ASPARTATE OXIDASE (FOR ASPARTATE DETECTION); VARY THE NUMBER OF POLYMER-BOUND ELECTRON RELAYS, WHICH WILL OPTIMIZE THE SENSOR RESPONSE TO SUBSTRATE, MINIMIZE THE OPERATING VOLTAGE TO DECREASE ANY INTERFERENCE DUE TO EASILY OXIDIZABLE SPECIES, AND ELIMINATEANY DECREASE IN RESPONSE DUE TO DISSOLVED OXYGEN. IN ADDITION, IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE RESPONSE TO ACETYLCHOLINE, ELIMINATE INTERFERENCE DUE TO SPURIOUS ANIONIC SPECIES, AND PREVENT SENSOR FOULING, A COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE ANIONIC POLY(ESTER SULFONIC ACID) WILL BE USED TO COAT THE ACETYLCHOLINE SENSOR.",

THE SENSORS ARE BASED ON THE SELECTIVE DETECTION OF PRODUCTS FORMED BY REACTIONS THAT ARE CATALYZEDBY THESE SERUM ENZYMES. A NOVEL SENSOR DESIGN PERMITS ITS OPERATION AT LOW APPLIED POTENTIALS, WHERE SPURIOUS CURRENT MEASUREMENTS DUE TO OXIDATION OF COMMON INTERFERENTS (E.G., ASCORBATE, URATE) ARE AVOIDED. DURING PHASE II, THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL BE EXTENDED TO THE SELECTIVE DETECTION OF OTHER LABORATORY MARKERS OF ALCOHOLISM, SUCH AS CREATININE, UREA, AND GLUTAMATE DEHYDROGENASE. THE OPTIMIZED SENSORS COULD SERVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE DAILY CLINICAL PRACTICE OF DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSTICS OF ALCOHOL-RELATED ORGAN DAMAGE AND IN FOLLOWUP STUDIES OF ALCOHOLISM TREATMENT PROGRAMS.",

THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE PHASE I EFFORT IS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT A SILICON MELT INFILTRATION PROCESS CAN BE USED TO FABRICATE A DENSE COMPOSITE WITH CONTROLLED QUANTITIES OF FREE SILICON OR FREE CARBON IN THE MATRIX. A SECOND OBJECTIVE IS TO DEMONSTRATE A FIBER COATING SYSTEM THAT WILL GIVE THE COMPOSITE THE REQUIRED TOUGHNESS. SIC FIBER REINFORCED, PHENOLIC RESIN MATRIX, 2D LAMIATE PREFORMS WILL BE PREPARED BY CONVENTIONAL RESIN COMPOSITE TECHNOLOGY. THE FIBERS WILL HAVE A CARBON COATING TO PROTECT THEM AND TO PROMOTE WETTING BY THE INFILTRANT. VARIOUS MATRIX RESINS WILL BE USED SO THAT PYROLYSIS WILL YIELD POROUS PREFORMS WITH OPEN POROSITIES BETWEEN 15% AND 30%. THE PYROLYZED PREFORMS WILL BE MELT INFILTRATED WITH LIQUID SILICON TO CONVERT THE MATRIX CARBON TO SIC. THE FIBER COATING EFFORT WILL FOCUS ON THE USE OF BN OR CARBON AS THE WEAK FIBER/MATRIX INTERFACE AND BN OR SIO2 AS THE DIFFUSION BARRIER. BN AND CARBON FIBER COATINGS WILL BE APPLIED BY CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION (CVD). SIO2 DIFFUSION BARRIERS WILL BE FORMED IN SITU BY OXIDATION OF AN SIC OUTER FIBER COATING.

NSP TECHNIQUES DISSECT HIGHER ORDER STATISTICAL SIGNAL STRUCTURE WHICH PERMIT ENHANCED DIFFERENTIATION FROM BACKGROUND. UNLIKE HEURISTICS, NSP OFFER RIGOROUS METHODS TO IDENTIFY AND EXTRACT INFORMATION NOT AVAILABLE FROM LINEAR TECHNIQUES, E.G., THE FFT IS BLIND TO CERTAIN INFORMATION THAT CAN ONLY BE EXTRACTED BY MULTISPECTRA, I.E., \"HIGHER-ORDER' SPECTRA. PHASE I DEMONSTRATES THE UTILITY OF FUNDAMENTAL NSP TECHNIQUES UNDERLYING ENHANCED DETECTION/CLASSIFICATION OF BROADBAND SIGNALS EMANATING FROM NONLINEAR SOURCES. THE PROBLEMS ARE: NONLINEAR SYSTEMS WHICH ARE ACTIVELY PROBED, OR PASSIVELY MONITORED, THE LATTER BEING MORE DIFFICULT AND REPRESENTING TWO FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS IN DOD SURVEILLANCE REQUIREMENTS: DETECTION AND CLASSIFICATION. A CASE STUDY USES SPREAD-SPECTRUM EMITTERS BECAUSE OF THEIR IMPORTANCE AND BECAUSE THEY GENERATE BROADBAND SIGNALS FROM AN INHERENT NONLINEAR SIGNAL GENERATION MECHANISM.

HOWEVER, TWO MAJOR IMPEDIMENTS TO EFFECTIVE CHEMOTHERAPY ARE THE INABILITY TO PREDICT WHICHPATIENTS WOULD RESPOND TO A GIVEN DRUG REGIMEN AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF MULTIPLE DRUG RESISTANCE IN A LARGE NUMBER OFCANCER PATIENTS WHO INITIALLY RESPOND WELL TO CHEMOTHERAPY. DIAGNOSTIC REAGENTS THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO DETERMINE IF AND WHEN A PATIENT DEVELOPED DRUG RESISTANCE ASWELL AS REAGENTS CAPABLE OF PREDICING THE RESPONSIVENESS OF AN INDIVIDUAL PATIENT TO A GIVEN CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC REGIMEN PRIOR TO TREATMENT WOULD GREATLY EXPAND THE UTILITY OF AVAILABLE ANTICANCER DRUGS. THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP SENSITIVE IMMUNOLOGICAL REAGENTS CAPABLE OF QUANTITATING AND IDENTIFYING THE AMOUNT OF TOPOISOMERASE II PRESENT IN A CANCEROUS CELL. BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF TOPOISOMERASE II PRESENT IN A CELL IS WELL CORRELATED WITH THE THERAPEUTIC UTILITY OF MANY ANTICANCER DRUGS, THESE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES WILL BE USEFUL IN PRESCRIBING AND MONITORING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC REGIMEN.

COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS (CFD) METHODS PROVIDE A GOOD WAY TO PERFORM THESE SIMULATIONS OF ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENA, SINCE THEY ALLOW FOR THE EASY VARIATION OF INDEPENDENT VARIABLES. HOWEVER, AS THE NUMBER OF POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS OF VARIABLES INCREASES, THE AMOUNT OF GENERATED DATA GROWS TO THE POINT THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO DISTILL SPECIFIC RESULTS FROM THE SOLUTIONS. AN INNOVATIVE METHOD IS PROPOSED HERE WHICH WILL APPLY AN \"INTELLIGENT\" POSTPROCESSOR TO THE RESULTS OF A SERIES OF RELATED COMPUTATIONS TO GIVE INSIGHT INTO THE CAUSE-AND-EFFECT RELATIONSHIPS FOR VARIOUS FLOW QUANTITIES. THE POSTPROCESSOR DETERMINES HOW CERTAIN FLOW RESULTS, FOR EXAMPLE, THE TIME HISTORY OF A TURBULENT VELOCITY FIELD, ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE VARIABLES OF THE CALCULATION, SUCH AS THE DEGREE OF STRATIFICATION. THE CODE ALSO DETERMINES IF A FLOW RESULT IS DEPENDENT UPON MORE THAN ONE VARIABLE. IN ADDITION, THE POSTPROCESSOR CHECKS FOR CORRELATIONS AMONG SEVERAL FLOW QUANTITIES OF INTEREST OVER THECOURSE OF A CALCULATION. THE RESULT OF THE POSTPROCESSING IS THE DETERMINATION OF FUNCTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE COMPUTED FLOW QUANTITIES AND THE INPUT VARIABLES, IN ADDITION TO THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE FLOW QUANTITIES THEMSELVES.",

DURING THE PAST DECADE, NEUREX CORPORATION HAS DEVELOPED THETOOLS FOR THE SUCCESSFUL DETECTION, CHARACTERIZATION, AND IDENTIFICATION OF PHYSIOLOGICALLY RELEVANT ACTH RECEPTORS. IT IS NOW PLANNED TO ISOLATE THE GENES CODING FOR THE ACTH RECEPTORS FIRST FROM A RAT ADRENAL CDNA LIBRARY BY TRANSFECTING COS 7 CELLS WITH A RAT ADRENAL CDNA LIBRARY CONSTRUCTED IN THE EXPRESSION VECTOR PRC/CMV AND SELECTING CELLS EXPRESSING THE RECEPTOR BY A LIGAND-BINDING TECHNIQUE INVOLVING ANTIBODIES AGAINST THE CARBOXY TERMINAL OF ACTH. THE RAT ADRENAL ACTH RECEPTOR CDNA WILL THEN BE USED TO ISOLATE THE CORRESPONDING CDNA FOR THE HUMAN RECEPTOR FROM A HUMAN ADRENAL CDNA LIBRARY CONSTRUCTED IN THE VECTOR LAMBDA-UNIZAP-XR. THE HUMAN ACTH RECEPTOR AND SUBTYPES ISOLATED BY PCR CLONING WILL BE EXPRESSED STABLY IN CHO CELLS, AND THE BIOCHEMICAL COUPLING MECHANISMS WILL BE INVESTIGATED.

T PRESENT, RF GUIDED MISSILES ARE TESTED IN HARDWARE-IN-THE-LOOP (HIL) LABORATORIES USING ONE OF TWO TECHNIQUES FOR THE PRESENTATION OF TARGET SIGNATURES, JAMMING SOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS. THE LESS EXPENSIVE OF THE TWO TECHNIQUES GENERATES APPROPRIATE ANGLES AND ANGULAR RATES USING MICROWAVE HORNS SERVO-POSITIONED IN ONE OR TWO AXES. ADVANTAGES OF THE SERVO-POSITIONED APPROACH INCLUDE MODERATE COST AND THE CAPABILITY TO HANDLE POWER LEVELS REQUIRED FOR SIMULATION OF THREAT REPRESENTATIVE JAMMING SOURCES. DISADVANTAGES OF THE SERVO-POSITIONED HORN TECHNIQUE INCLUDE INABILITY TO REPRESENT TARGET GLINT AND RESTRICTION TO SCENARIOS INCLUDING ONE OR TWO SOURCES. THE SECOND TECHNIQUE EMPLOYS AN ARRAY OF HORNS DRIVEN BY A COMPLET NETWORK OF MICROWAVE DEVICES. ADVANTAGES OF THE HORN ARRAY INCLUDE THE ABILITY TO REPRESENT MANY TARGETS AND TO SIMULATE COMPLEX TARGET SIGNATURE PHENOMENA. DISADVANTAGES INCLUDE COST AND THE INABILITY TO HANDLE THE RELATIVE AND ABSOLUTE POWER LEVELS REQUIRED FOR TESTS IN THE JAMMING ENVIRONMENTS. A MICROWAVE VECTOR VOLTMETER HAS BEEN DEVELOPED THAT IS CAPABLE OF PERFORMING THESE FUNCTIONS OVER A PORTION OF THE MICROWAVE SPECTRUM WHILE OVERCOMING ALL OF THE ABOVE MENTIONED DISADVANTAGES. THE PROCESSING OF A MODULATION SIGNAL INPUT TO THE VECTOR MODULATOR WILL EMPLOY DIRECT DIGITAL SYNTHESIS (DDS) TECHNIQUES.",

WE WILL BUILD AND TEST A VIDEO TACHISTOSCOPE CAPABLE OF 500 FRAMES PER SECOND, 512X512 PIXELS PER FRAME, AND 8-BITS PER PIXEL. AT 500 FRAMES PER SECOND, THE TEMPORAL RESOLUTION IS ONE FRAME INTERVAL OR 2 MILLISECONDS WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR PERCEPTUAL EXPERIMENTS USING TACHISTOSCOPIC PRESENTATIONS IN THE STUDY OF SPATIO-TEMPORAL RESPONSE CHARACTERISTICS OR MOTION. THE FAST DISPLAY SYSTEM WILL CONSIST OF A SPECIALLY DESIGNED MONITOR WITH P167 PHOSPHOR, A CONTROLLER WITH IMAGE MEMORY, AND AN INTERFACE TO A MICROCOMPUTER. THE CONTROLLER MEMORY MODULE WILL STORE FROM 1 TO 128 IMAGES WHICH COULD BE GENERATED BY THE COMPUTER OR SELECTED FROM A LIBRARY OF STIMULUS IMAGES. THE DISPLAY SEQUENCE WILL BE PROGRAMMABLE SO THAT EACH OF THE STORED IMAGES CAN BE DISPLAYED FOR A SPECIFIED NUMBER OF VIDEO FRAMES.

THIS MEDICAL DIAGNOSTIC TECHNIQUE IS CAPABLE OF DISCERNING AND IMAGING MEDICALLY INTERESTING PHENOMENA, SUCH AS THE ACTIVITY OF VARIOUS PARTS OF THE BRAIN, OXYGEN FLOW IN THE BODY, AND OTHER QUANTITIES WHICH ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE BY ANY OTHER DIAGNOSTIC TECHNIQUE. IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE SHOW THAT HIGH ELECTROSTATIC VOLTAGES CAN BE PRODUCED BY PLACING HIGH VOLTAGE MODULES INSIDE ONE ANOTHER WITH THE HIGH VOLTAGE CONNECTION SUPPLIED BY THE BEAM ITSELF. MOTIVE POWER IS SUPPLIED TO THE INDIVIDUAL STAGES BY AN AIR CORE TRANSFORMERTECHNIQUE. ISOLATION BETWEEN STAGES IS ASSURED BY THE ENCLOSED NATURE OF THE CONFIGURATION. WE EFFECTIVELY HOUSE EACH 60 KV ACCELERATING STAGE INSIDE ITS OWN FARADAY CAGE. THESE CAGES ARE 'NESTED' INSIDE OF ONE ANOTHER, AND THEY IN TURN, FORM A PARTIALLY COMPLETE FARADAY CAGE WHICH ALLOWS PENETRATION OF MAGNETIC FIELDS FOR THE TRANSFORMER ACTION. BY USING RESONANT CIRCUITS, TRANSISTOR SWITCHING TECHNIQUES CAN BE USED TO SUPPLY THE POWER TO THE SECONDARIES EVEN WHEN THE TRANSFORMER COUPLING IS EXTREMELY LOW. INSIDE EACH NEST, WE HAVE A MULTI-TURN SECONDARY WINDING, A 3:1 VOLTAGE MULTIPLIER (SIMILAR TO A TELEVISION VOLTAGE MULTIPLIER) AND OVERVOLTAGE PROTECTION CIRCUITS. BYUSING A NEGATIVE ION SOURCE AND A STRIPPING FOIL, WE CAN RUN THE ACCELERATOR IN A TANDEM CONFIGURATION. OUR OVERALL GOALS ARE THE PRODUCTION OF .8 MEV,.4 MA DEUTERON BEAMS IN PHASE I.",

THE PROGRAMS WILL ADAPT SOCIAL LEARNING PARENTING AND TEEN BEHAVIOR CHANGE SKILLS TO FIT THE ECOLOGICAL AND INTERPERSONAL SITUATIONS OF ETHNICALLY DIVERSE URBAN FAMILIES. TWO URBAN CONSULTATION TEAMS COMPOSED OF PARENTS,TEENS, AND COMMUNITY LEADERS WILL ASSIST IN DEVELOPING THE PROGRAMS. IN PHASE I, A TAPE FOR PARENTS THAT TEACHES THE SKILLS OF MONITORING AND SUPERVISING CHILD BEHAVIOR OUTSIDE OF THE HOME AND A TAPE FOR ADOLESCENTS THAT TEACHES SKILLS FOR HANDLING THE PRESSURE TO ENGAGE IN VARIOUS ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIORS WILL BE DEVELOPED AND EVALUATED. A CONSULTATION TEAM WILL PROVIDE DIRECTION AND FEEDBACK. FORTY FAMILIES WILL BE RECRUITED AND THEIR ACQUISTION OF TARGETED SKILLS EVALUATED AFTER 2 WEEKS. SUBJECTS WILL ALSO PROVIDE CONSUMER SATISFACTION RATINGS. DURING PHASE II, THE COMPLETE SET OF 6 PARENT AND 6 ADOLESCENT VIDEO PROGRAMS WILL BE DEVELOPED. A SECOND URBANSITE WILL BE TARGETED AND A CONSULTATION TEAM FORMED. ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY AT-RISK MIDDLE SCHOOL YOUTH AND THEIR PARENTS WILL BE RECRUITED TO EVALUATE THE COMPLETE PACKAGE. MARKETS FOR THESE COMPLETE PACKAGES WILL BE EXPLORED AND CONTACTS ESTABLISHED FOR EVENTUAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM.",

TWO PARAMETERS APPEAR TO BE ESSENTIAL FOR TRANSFORMATION BY P60C-SRC: (1) THE PRESENCE OF AN ACTIVE PROTEIN TYROSINE KINASE, AND (2) THE CORRECT LOCALIZATION OF THE P60C-SRC PROTEIN AT THE PLASMA MEMBRANE. RECENT STUDIES HAVE SUGGESTED THE PRESENCE OF A SPECIFIC, HIGH-AFFINITY P60C-SRC-BINDING PROTEIN AT THE INTERNAL FACE OF RED CELL GHOST MEMBRANES THAT RECOGNIZES PEPTIDE SEQUENCES LOCATED WITHIN THE 15 N-TERMINAL RESIDUES OF P60C-SRC. THE AIMS OF THIS PHASE I PROJECT ARE (1) TO DEMONSTRATE SPECIFIC HIGH-AFFINITY BINDING OF A N-TERMINAL 19-MER P60C-SRC PEPTIDE TO RED CELL GHOST MEMBRANES AND TO COLON CARCINOMA AND NORMAL COLON PLASMA MEMBRANES, (2) TO DEMONSTRATE HIGH-AFFINITY BINDING OF PURIFIED HUMAN P60C-SRC TO THESE MEMBRANES, AND (3) TO CROSS-LINK PURIFIED P60C-SRC TO THE RED CELL MEMBRANE ACCEPTOR PROTEIN. IN PHASE II, IT IS PLANNED TO PURIFY THE SPECIFIC PLASMA MEMBRANE P60C-SRC-BINDING PROTEINS FROM COLON CARCINOMA AND NORMAL CELL LINES AND TO DEVELOP ASSAYS FOR DETECTION OF AGENTS ENABLING THE THERAPEUTIC MANIPULATION OF THIS ESSENTIAL PROCESS IN P60C-SRC-MEDIATED TRANSFORMATION.",

CANDIDATE PEPTIDES WILL BE PREPARED AND EXAMINED AS MODEL SUBSTRATES FOR THE KINASE. THE COMPONENTS WILL THEN BE CONFIGURED TO AHIGH-THROUGHPUT ASSAY DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL DRUGS. IN PHASE II, ONCOGENE SCIENCE, INC., WILL CLONE AND EXPRESS THE KINASE, IF THIS IS REQUIRED, AND INITIATE SCREENING. SECONDARY SCREENS DESIGNED TO EVALUATE THE SPECIFICITY AND IN VIVO EFFECTIVENESS OF LEAD COMPOUNDS FROM THE PRIMARY HIGH-THROUGHPUT SCREEN WILL ALSO BE ESTABLISHED.",

THESE CELL LINES WILL PROVIDE A NONINFECTIOUS, POSITIVE CONTROL STANDARD FOR SUCH DIAGNOSTIC MOLECULAR TESTS AS SOUTHERN ANALYSIS, NORTHERN ANALYSIS, IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION, AND THE POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION. THE USE OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AS A DIAGNOSTIC TOOL IS GROWINGWORLDWIDE. AS THE INCLUSION OF A KNOWN POSITIVE CONTROL IS NECESSARY IN EVERY TEST, THESE NONINFECTIOUS CELL LINES WOULD ACT AS A STANDARD CONTROL. CURRENTLY, INFECTED MATERIALS FROM PATIENTS WITH AIDS ACT AS THESE CONTROLS. THESE MATERIALS ARE INFECTIOUS AND POSE A DIRECT HEALTH HAZARD TO THE LABORATORY WORKER. BY EMPLOYING THESE CONTROLCELL LINES, THAT RISK WOULD BE ELIMINATED. AIDS IS ONLY ONE OF MANY BLOOD-BORNE INFECTIOUS AGENTS. OTHER CONTROL CELL LINES, CONTAINING THE INDIVIDUAL GENES OFHTLV-I, HEPATITIS B, AND HUMAN PAPILLOMA VIRUS COULD ALSO BEDEVELOPED.",

THE METHOD RELIES ON NONE OF THE TYPICALLY USED SIGNATURES (I.E., THERMAL, RADAR, ELECTRONIC, VISUAL, AUDIO, OR CONTRAIL) AND THUS WOULD BE IMMUNE TO ALL THE PRESENTLY EXISTING DECOYS AND COUNTERMEASURES. THE SENSOR SPECIFICALLY DETECTS AND MEASURES THE RELATIVE CONCENTRATION AND CHEMICAL SIGNATURE OF FUEL COMBUSTION PRODUCTS. SINCE ALL TARGETS WHICH RELY ON ENGINES FOR PROPULSION MUST COMBUST FUEL, THIS SENSOR CANNOT BE EASILY DECOYED AND WOULD BE VERY EFFECTIVE AGAINST LOW-OBSERVABLE TARGETS. THE SENSOR IS PASSIVE AND THUS NOT ITSELF OBSERVABLE OR DIRECTLY JAMMABLE DURING ITS DETECTING/TARGETING OPERATION. IT COULD BE ADAPTED TO FUNCTION AS A SIMPLE TARGET GUIDANCE SENSOR, OR INCORPORATED INTO SCANNING SYSTEMS TO SUPPLEMENT ACTIVE RADAR FOR THE DETECTION OF LOW-OBSERVABLE TARGETS. THE SENSOR COULD BE USED IN AIRBORNE, GROUND AND SPACEBORNE APPLICATIONS. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - THE SENSOR HAS TWO MAJOR ANTICIPATED BENEFITS. FIRST, IT CAN BE USED AS A PASSIVE DECOY-RESISTANT SENSOR FOR MISSILE GUIDANCE, REPLACING THE PRESENT COMMON HEAT-SEEKING TECHNOLOGY. SECONDLY, IF INCORPORATED INTO AN IMAGING SYSTEM, IT HAS POTENTIAL TO AUGMENT OTHER SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS, ENABLING THE DETECTION AND TRACKING OF LOW-OBSERVABLE AIRCRAFT AND MISSILES IN CLUTTERED ENVIRONMENTS.

THIS IS PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE THE ANGULAR SENSITIVITY OF A FABRY-PEROT INTERFEROMETER IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE WIDTH OF THE ETALON. HENCE, IT CAN BE MADE MORE SENSITIVE BY WIDENING THE ETALON. A 10 MM WIDE ETALON, FOR EXAMPLE, YIELDS A WHOLE FRINGE FOR EVERY 50 MICRO-RADIANS OF CHANGE IN THE ANGLE OF INCIDENCE AT A WAVELENGTH OF 0.63 MICRON. THIS ANGULAR SENSITIVITY CAN BE USED TO MEASURE SECONDARY PHENOMENA THAT INDUCE ROTATION SUCH AS VIBRATION AND ACCELERATION. CONVENTIONAL FABRY-PEROT ETALONS ARE POLISHED SLABS OF GLASSWHOSE FLATNESS AND PARALLELISM ARE MAINTAINED TO A HIGH DEGREE OF TOLERANCE. THIS PROCESS IS COSTLY AND TIME CONSUMING. WE PRESENT AN ALTERNATIVE WAY OF FABRICATING FABRY-PEROT ETALONS WITH THE USE OF WAVEGUIDE MICROFABRICATION TECHNOLOGY. THERE ARE DISTINCT ECONOMIC ADVANTAGES TO THIS APPROACH BECAUSE THE RESULTANT MICRO-SENSOR WILL BE CHEAPER THAN THE CONVENTIONAL ONE WHEN MASS-PRODUCED. WE AIM AT DETERMINING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MICROFABRICATION TECHNIQUES AT PRODUCING SEMICONDUCTOR MICRO-ETALONS WHOSE PERFORMANCE IS COMPARABLE TO THAT OF THEGLASS ONES.

THE PROPOSED IMAGING ELECTRON MULTIPLIER (IEM) DEVICE INCORPORATES AN AXIALLY ALIGNED STACK OF DISCRETE HIGH-RESOLUTION, POROUS DYNODES EMPLOYING A HIGHLY-CONDUCTIVE SECONDARY-ELECTRON-EMITTING MATERIAL. ITS MODULAR DESIGN PERMITS THE USER TO TAILOR THE DEVICE FOR SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS: E.G., IN A LARGE-AREA MCP PHOTOMULTIPLIER TUBE, THE IEM IS EXPECTED TO OFFER SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO OVER A CONVENTIONAL MCP. THE IEM IS ALSO CAPABLE OF VERY HIGH CURRENT OUTPUT WHEN COMPRISING A LARGE NUMBER OF DYNODE STACKS ( 10), FUNCTIONING AS A POWER MICROCHANNEL PLATE. THE IEM SHOULD FIND APPLICATIONS IN ASTRONOMICAL IMAGING, SPECTROSCOPY, NIGHT VISION IMAGING, AND IN MCP-BASED HIGH-SPEED SPATIAL LIGHT MODULATORS.",

OPTRON'S TECHNIQUE USES PASSIVE DISPERSIVE OPTICAL ELEMENTS (GRATING AND LENSES) TO SPECTRALLY SEPARATE THE INCIDENT RADIATION, WHILE PRESERVING IMAGE RESOLUTION. THIS SPECTRAL IMAGE CONTINUUM IS FOCUSSED SIMULTANEOUSLY ONTO LINEAR SPATIAL LIGHT MODULATORS, WHICH SELECT THE SPECIFIC NARROW-BAND SPECTRAL REGION TO BE EXAMINED. THE FILTERED WAVELENGTHS OF INTEREST ARE THEN DISPERSION COMPENSATED AND REIMAGED ONTO THE APPROPRIATE IMAGING DETECTORS (E.G., CCD CAMERAS) BEFORE BEING DOWNLOADED TO AN ELECTRONIC COMPUTER FOR POST PROCESSING.IN ITS ULTIMATE FORM, THE DEVICE CAN COVER THE WAVELENGTH RANGE BETWEEN 1 UM AND 12 UM, PROVIDE WAVELENGTH SWITCHING IN < OR - UM, AND BE CAPABLE OF LINEAR OR RANDOM SPECTRAL SCANNING. THIS TECHNIQUE HAS THE ADVANTAGES OF HIGH-SPEED SWITCHING, BROAD-WAVELENGTH BAND COVERAGE, LOW-POWER CONSUMPTION, MEDIUM-VOLTAGE CONTROL (< OR - 500V), AND RELATIVELY REASONABNLE MANUFACTURING COST DUE THE USE OF STANDARD PASSIVE AND ELECTRO-OPTIC MATERIALS. THE DEVICE SCANS ELECTRO-OPTICALLY AND HAS NO MOVING PARTS.",

THE NEED FOR INCREASED PROCESSING POWER IN SMALL AND ROBUST PACKAGES IS ESPECIALLY ACUTE FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF ASAT WEAPONS SYSTEMS, BUT DEVELOPMENT OF VIABLE OPTICAL COMPUTING DEVICES HAS BEEN SLOW. THE MOST BASIC AND CRITICAL OPTICAL COMPONENT IS THE SPATIAL LIGHT MODULATORS (SLM). FOR EXAMPLE, THE SLM IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF OPTICAL CORRELATORS THAT MAY BE USED FOR MULTITARGET DETECTION, ACQUISITION AND TRACKING. WE PROPOSE A NEW BREED OF SLMS BASED ON THE RELATIVELY RECENT PROGRESS IN INTEGRATED VACUUM MICROELECTRONICS. ADVANCES IN FABRICATION AND PROCESSING TECHNIQUES HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE TO PRODUCE INTEGRATED ARRAYS OF THOUSANDS OF COLD CATHODE ELECTRON EMITTERS. THESE DEVICES ARE SUPERIOR TO THERMIONIC CATHODES AND MICROCHANNEL ELECTRON MULTIPLIERS IN SEVERAL RESPECTS INCLUDING OUTPUT CURRENT DENSITY, SIZE, RUGGEDNESS, RADIATION HARDNESS AND SPEED. THE PROPOSED WORK PLAN AIMS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF FIELD EMITTER TECHNOLOGY FOR SPATIAL LIGHT MODULATOR DEVICES. EMITTER ARRAYS WILL BE EXPERIMENTALLY CHARACTERIZED AND A PROTOTYPE ELECTROOPTIC MODULATOR WILL BE DEMONSTRATED IN PHASE I. DESIGN OF A 2-D MODULATOR WILL BE CONSIDERED, INCLUDING OPTIMIZED ADDRESSING SCHEMES FOR INCREASIG DATA FRAME RATES.",

ARTEMISININ AND ITS DERIVATIVES ARE ALSO BEING STUDIED FOR THE TREATMENT OF PARASITIC DISEASES AND DISEASES OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. ATTEMPTS TO DEVELOP A PROTOCOL THAT CAN BE USED FOR COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION OF THE DRUG HAVE THUS FAR FAILED BECAUSE THE PLANT PRODUCES ARTEMISININ ONLY IN MINUTE AMOUNTS.

TO OVERCOME THESE PROBLEMS, IT IS PLANNED TO INCREASE IN SITU THROUGH LEAF ORGAN CULTURES THE NUMBER OF GLANDULAR TRICHOME CELLS. THESE CELLS ARE THOUGHT TO BE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE BIOSYNTHESIS OF ARTEMISININ. THE TRICHOME MOTHER CELLS FROM WHICH THE GLAND CELLS ARISE WILL BE NATURAL TARGETS FOR INDUCTION OF CELL DIVISION BY PLANT HORMONES BECAUSE THE DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAM FOR THESE TYPES OF CELLS APPEARS TO BE TRANSMITTED THROUGH CELL LINEAGE.

SECOND, IT IS NECESSARY TO DEVELOP NEW WAYS OF MOUNTING THESE TRANSDUCERS ON CONDUIT SO THAT ACOUSTIC SHORT CIRCUIT DOES NOT OVERWHELM THE RECEIVER. TWOINNOVATIVE LOW-Z TRANSDUCER (SENSOR) DESIGNS ARE HEREIN PROPOSED. THE FIRST USES SLOW LEAKY FLEXURAL WAVES OF FREQUENCY F PROPAGATING IN A CONICAL RADIATOR OF THICKNESS D. THE FD PRODUCT CONTROLS THE PHASE VELOCITY CF OF THE LEAKY FLEXURAL WAVES AND THEREBY CONTROLS THE ULTRASONIC RADIATION PATTERN IN THE H2 GAS. THE SECOND LOW-Z TRANSDUCER USES A LASER-PERFORATED PLATE TO SANDWICH THE GASBETWEEN ITSELF AND THE SOLID SURFACE OF AN ULTRASONIC PISTON. WHEN THE PISTON IS ENERGIZED, THE COMPRESSED GAS SQUIRTS THROUGH THE PERFORATIONS AS A VELOCITY-TRANSFORMED PULSE HAVING ULTRASONIC FREQUENCY COMPONENTS CORRESPONDING TO VORTICES SHED BY THE HOLES. BOTH TRANSDUCERS, IF SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED, WOULD ENABLE BIDIRECTIONAL FLOW OF LOW-Z CRYOGENS TO BE MEASURED AT RESPONSE TIMES <0.1 S.

TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM, WE PROPOSE THE USE OF ULTRASONIC TORSIONAL WAVES IN SENSORS HAVING TWO SPECIAL CROSS SECTIONS. THE SENSOR OF NONCIRCULAR CROSS SECTION RESPONDS TO DENSITY RHO WHEN ORIENTED HORIZONTALLY, AND TO THE PRODUCT OF DENSITY AND HEIGHT, RHOH, WHEN VERTICAL. THE SENSOR OF CIRCULAR CROSS SECTION RESPONDS TO THE PRODUCT OF DENSITY AND VISCOSITY, RHOETA. THE \"VISCOSITY\" SENSOR IS INCLUDED TO MONITOR SALT BUILDUP AND COMPENSATE FOR BUILDUP IF IT OCCURS. SENSOR MATERIAL, SURFACE PREPARATION AND POSSIBLY VIBRATORY MEANS SHALL BE SELECTED TO DISCOURAGE SALT BUILDUP. TEMPERATURE COMPENSATION IS TO BE ACCOMPLISHED BY TIMING EXTENSIONAL WAVES IN THE SAME SENSORS THAT, WHEN TORSIONALLY EXCITED, RESPOND TO RHO, ETA,OR H.",

WE AIM TO DEFINE DESIGN PARAMETERS AND BUILD PROTOTYPE HARDWARE FOR A COMMERCIAL RESEARCH INSTRUMENT BASED ON PARK SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS' CURRENT RANGE OF SCANNING TUNNELING MICROSCOPES; THIS WILL ENABLE MORE WIDESPREAD EVALUATION OF THE TECHNIQUE BY PROCESS ENGINEERS ON THEIR OWN PROCESSES, USING DEBUGGED HARDWARE THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN OPTIMISED FOR THE APPLICATION. WE PROPOSE TO EVALUATE PERFORMANCE BOTH ON SIMPLE TEST STRUCTURES AS WELL AS ON TYPICAL PRODUCTION SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES AND TO COMPARE RESULTS WITH ALTERNATIVE DESTRUCTIVE AND NON-DESTRUCTIVE MEASUREMENT TEHCNIQUES AS WELL AS WITH THEORY. IN THIS EFFORT WE PLAN TO COLLABORATE EXTENSIVELY WITH LOCAL PROCESS ENGINEERS, WHO WILL PROVIDE TEST SAMPLES. WE WILL INVESTIGATE HOW ESTABLISHED CAPACITANCE FEEDBACK DEPTH PROFILING TECHNIQUES COULD BE COMBINED WITH THE SCANNING CAPACITANCE MICROSCOPE TO FURTHER EXTEND THE TECHNIQUE.

FOR EXAMPLE, SMALL PIECES OF BROKEN MOLD MUST OFTEN BE TEDIOUSLY SEPARATED FROM SMALL PIECES OF METALLIC FUEL.

A CONTINUOUS CASTING MACHINE HAS BEEN DESIGNED, FABRICATED AND USED TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF THE CASTING PROCESS. THE CONCEPT OF CONTINUOUS CASTING WITHOUT MOLDS ISIDEALLY SUITED FOR THE REMOTE FABRICATION OF METALLIC NUCLEAR FUEL RODS IN AN IFR FUEL RECYCLE FACILITY.

TO REALIZE THE POTENTIAL OF FERROELETRIC MEMORIES FOR ADVANCED APPLICATIONS, SUPERIOR MATERIALS, AND PROCESSING TEHCNIQUES MUST BE APPLIED TO INCREASED PERFORMANCE RELIABILITY. THIS PROJECT WILL ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF A NOVEL APPROACH TO ACHIEVING DESIRED DEVICE PERFORMANCE BY UTILIZING THIN FILMS OF FERROELECTRIC BISMUTH TITANATE, BI4TI3O12. THE FERROELECTRIC PROPERTIES OF BISMUTH TITANATE, EXTREMELY LOW AGING EFFECT, FAST SWITCHING CAPABILITY AND LOW COERCIVE FIELD, MAKE IT A VERY ATTRACTIVE MATERIAL FOR MEMORY APPLICATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, THE METHOD PROPOSED CAN ACHIEVE LOW TEMPERATURE FORMATION OF ORIENTED THIN FILMS OF BISMUTH TITANATE AND CAN BE INTEGRATED INTO A STANDARD SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESS FLOW. THE PHASE I RESEARCH WILL DEPOSIT BISMUTH TITANATE FILMS AND EXPERIMENTALLY DETERMINE THE FILM'S FERROELECTRIC CHARACTERISTICS AND RELATE THEM TO THE OBSERVED MICROSTRUCTURE AND DEPOSITION PROCESS VARIABLES. THE PROCESS WILL BE OPTIMIZED AND SCALED UP IN PHASE II/ ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - THIS PROCESSING TECHNIQUE WILL ENABLE COMMERCIAL SCALE PRODUCTION OF IN ORIENTED FERROELECTRIC THIN FILMS ON SILICON FOR MICROELECTRONIC MEMORY APPLICATIONS.

THESE MATERIALS POSSESS HIGH STIFFNESSES AND TENSILE STRENGTHS COMBINED WITH LOW DENSITY, AND THEY HAVE BECOME THE MATERIAL OF CHOICE IN NUMEROUS HIGH PERFORMANCE APPLICATIONS. THE SAME CANNOT BE SAID FOR COMPRESSIVE PROPERTIES OF THESE MATERIALS, WHICH ARE OFTEN MUCH LOWER THAN THEIR TENSILE COUNTERPARTS. THIS OFTEN RESULTS IN OVERDESIGNING FOR COMPRESSION, WITH CORRESPONDINGLY HIGHER WEIGHT. REDUCED COMPRESSION BEHAVIOR IN SUCH MATERIALS IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO MICROFIBRILLAR BUCKLING AND KINKING PHENOMENA WHICH MAYBE ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIBER ITSELF, THE MATRIX, OR THE INTERFACE BETWEEN THE TWO. IN ORDER FOR COMPOSITES SUBJECTED TO BOTH TENSILE AND COMPRESSION TO BE OPTIMALLY DESIGNED, THESE PROPERTIES MUST BE INCREASED. THIS PROPOSAL PRESENTS AN INNOVATIVE AND EXCITING APPROACH TO IMPROVING THE PROPERTIES OF THESE MATERIALS BY SIMULTANEOUSLY IMPROVING BOTH THE FIBER AND THE LOAD TRANSFER AT THE FIBER-MATRIX INTERFACE BY EMPLOYING A UNIQUE METHOD FOR IMPROVING LATERAL SUPPORT TO THE FIBER. IN SO DOING, IT REDUCES THE TENDENCY OF FIBER TO FAIL THROUGH MICROBUCKLING, PROVIDES ENHANCED COUPLING AND INTERLOCKING IN THE INTERFACIAL REGION, INCREASES COMPRESSIVE PROPERTIES, AND OPENS NEW DOORS TO OPTIMAL DESIGN OF DOD SYSTEMS USING COMPOSITES. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - NUMEROUS BENEFITS SHOULD ACCRUE AS A RESULT OF IMPROVING COMPRESSIVE PROPERTIES OF A MAJOR CLASS OF MATERIALS, BOTH IN THE MILITARY AND CIVILIAN SECTOR. FOR DOD, THESE BENEFITS INCLUDE REDUCING THE TENDENCY TO OVERDESIGN IN HIGH PERFORMANCE APPLICATIONS (E.G., MILITARY AIRCRAFT, SHIPS, GROUND VEHICLES) TO COMPENSATE FOR POOR",

THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM THROUGH THE CREATION OF A PHYSICALLY BASED FAILURE CRITERION FOR CARBONPHENOLIC. BY \"PHYSICALLY BASED\" IT IS MEANT THAT THE FAILURE CRITERION MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION WILL BE BASED ON PHYSICAL MATERIAL PARAMETERS OBSERVED FROM TEST DATA. THIS IS OPPOSED TO A PURELY MATHEMATICAL \"CURVE FIT\" CRITERION WHICH MERELY SEEKS TO FIT TEST DATA. THIS CRITERION WILL SEPARATELY ADDRESS THREE DISTINCT PHASESOF CARBON-PHENOLIC BEHAVIOR THROUGHOUT ITS TEMPERATURE RANGE: THE LOW TEMPERATURE, PYROLYSIS AND HIGH TEMPERATURE PHASES.

NATURAL IL-7 WAS RECENTLY CLONED AND EXPRESSED IN COS-7 CELLS BUT IS NOT COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE. THIS PHASE I PROJECT SPECIFICALLY AIMS TO DEVELOP A RECOMBINANT DNA SYSTEM TO PRODUCE IL-7. THE APPROACH TO BE USED WILL INVOLVE THE ASSEMBLY OF A SYNTHETIC GENE CODING FOR HUMAN IL-7. THE GENE WILL BE CLONED INTO A PLASMID AND EXPRESSED IN E. COLI. PRODUCTION OF THE GENE PRODUCT WILL BE OPTIMIZED SO THAT IL-7 CAN BE ECONOMICALLY PRODUCED. HIGH-LEVEL EXPRESSION OF IL-7 WILL ENABLE PHASE II RESEARCH TO FOCUS ON THE E.

THE LESS PERMEABLE FABRICS BLOCK WC BETTER BUT ALSO BLOCK THE EVAPORATION OF SWEAT AND THUS COOLING OF THE WEARER WHO HAS TO CONTINUE AND FUNCTION UNDER INCREASED STRESS. PRELIMINARY STUDIES IN OUR LABORATORY SUGGEST THAT CERTAIN MATERIALS CAN BE ADDED TO THE FABRIC THAT (1) CATALYZE THE HYDROLYTIC REACTION BETWEEN SWEAT AND WC AND THUS ENHANCE THE RATE OF THEIR DETOXIFICATION, (2) DO NOT RESTRICT AND POSSIBLY INCREASE THE RATE OF WATER PERMEATION AND THUS REDUCE THE HEAT STRESS OF THE WEARER AND (3) ARE POTENTIALLY LIGHT-WEIGHT MATERIALS WHICH ARE COMPATIBLE WITH EXISTING GARMENT MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY. THE MAIN OBJECTIVES OF THE PROPOSED WORK ARE TO IDENTIFY THE IDEAL FABRIC-ADDITIVES/CATALYSTS FOR THE HYDROLYTIC DETOXIFICATION OF WC AND TO DETERMINE THEIR EFFECT ON THE RATE OF WATER AND OF WC PERMEATION THROUGH THE FABRIC.

WHOLE BLADDER PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY (WBPDT) PROVIDES AN ATTRACTIVE METHOD TO TREAT BLADDER CANCER BECAUSE IT MAY BE USED TO ERADICATE THE MICROSCOPIC PREMALIGNANT LESIONS THAT CAUSE BLADDER CANCER; BECAUSE THE MOST DEADLY FORM OF BLADDER CANCER, CARCINOMA IN SITU, IS UNIFORMLY SENSITIVE TO PDT; AND BECAUSE IT HAS NO SYSTEMIC SIDE EFFECTS. UNFORTUNATELY, PRESENT-DAY METHODS OF PHOTOIRRADIATING THE BLADDER WALL ARE CUMBERSOME, TIME CONSUMING, AND INACCURATE. PHOTORADIATION SYSTEMS' INTRAVESICAL LASER CATHETER AND MONITORING SYSTEM WILL PROVIDE SIMPLE, SAFE, AND EFFECTIVE WBPDT. THIS DELIVERY SYSTEM WILL ALSO EXTEND THE APPLICATION OF WBPDT TO TREAT PAPILLARY TUMORS, WHICH ARE NOW A CONTRAINDICATION TO INTRACAVITARY PDT. THIS DELIVERY SYSTEM FEATURES A BALLOON THAT TRANSFORMS THE BLADDER WALL INTO A SPHERE OF KNOWN VOLUME. PASSAGE OF A BULB-TIP TREATMENT FIBER INTO THE CATHETER AUTOMATICALLY LOCATES THE LIGHT EMITTER IN THE CENTER OF THE BALLOON AND BLADDER WALL. A LIGHT SENSOR INCORPORATED INTO THE BALLOON WALL ALLOWS CONTINUOUS MONITORING OF LIGHT FLUENCE AT THE BLADDER WALL AND PROVIDES A METHOD TO MEASURE CUMULATIVE LIGHT FLUENCE DURING WBPDT.",

ADVANCES IN SENSOR AND INTERCONNECT TECHNOLOGIES REQUIRE FIBER OPTIC CONNECTORS, COUPLERS AND CABLES WITH MULTI-CHANNEL CAPABILITIES AND HIGHER TOLERANCE TO THE HIGH TEMPERATURES AND RADIATION OF NUCLEAR ENVIRONMENTS. IMPLEMENTATION OF MULTI-CHANNEL FIBER CONNECTOR ARRAYS ALSO POSES SEVERAL PROBLEMS. IN THE FABRICATION OF FIBER OPTIC ARRAYS, DAMAGE CAN OCCUR TO THE END FACES DURING THE POLISH CYCLE. MATERIAL MISMATCH BETWEEN THE FIBER AND HOLDER CAN CAUSE UNEVEN MATERIAL REMOVAL DURING LAPPING THAT WILL CHIP AND CRACK FIBERS. THE BONDING METHOD MUST ALSO HOLD THE FIBER SECURELY TO THE HOLDER OR DAMAGE WILL RESULT. PHYSICAL OPTICS CORPORATION (POC) PROPOSES TWO HIGHLY EFFICIENT METHODS OF FIBER ARRAY FABRICATION BASED ON METALLIC NON-IMAGING OPTICS (NIO) BEAM EXPANDERS AND FUSED SILICA CAPILLARY TUBES THAT DEMONSTRATE HIGH EFFICIENCY, LOW BACK REFLECTION AND SIGNIFICANTLY LESS SENSITIVITY TO HIGH TEMPERATURES AND VIBRATION.

FIBER OPTICS INHERENT ADVANTAGES ENABLE NEW NETWORK CONFIGURATIONS TO INTEGRATE MIXED MEDIA (VOICE, VIDEO, DATA, ETC.) WITH VARYING DATA RATES (KBITS/S TO GBITS/S) INTO A SINGLE NETWORK. IN ADDITION, WAVELENGTH DIVISION MULTIPLEXING (WDM) GIVES FUTURE EXPANDABILITY AND ADDED FEATURES SUCH AS ON-LINE NETWORK TESTING AND DATA SELECTION, SECURITY, AND SELECTIVITY. POC PROPOSES TO DEVELOP A COMPARTMENT AREA NETWORK (CAN) THAT IS BOTH COST EFFECTIVE AND MEETS THE PRESENT NEEDS OF THE NAVY. POC'S CONCEPT IS BASED ON COMBINING THE BEST ATTRIBUTES OF BOTH WDM AND SAFENET/FDDI INTO A UNIQUE NETWORK REFERRED TO AS WAVELENGTH DISTRIBUTED DATA INTERFACE (WDDI). EDM WILL BE UTILIZED TO INCREASE THE NETWORK PERFORMANCE AS THE REQUIREMENTS GROW WITHOUT MAKING COMPLEX CHANGES TO EXISTING NETWORK HARDWARE OR SOFTWARE. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY COMBINING MANY OPTICAL INFORMATION CARRIERS ONTO A SINGLE FIBER IN A LOW LOSS MANNER. AN EXPLORATORY EIGHT-CHANNEL SINGLE-MODE WDDI SYSTEM WILL BE BUILT AND EVALUATED TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF THE CONCEPT AND ITS CAPABILITY FOR MIXED MEDIA, MIXED SOURCES, AND MIXED DATA RATES INFORMATION TRANSPORT.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         UTILIZING THE HUGE POTENTIAL BANDWIDTH OF OPTICAL FIBER BASED NETWORKS REQUIRES DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGIES WHICH ENABLE A LARGE NUMBER OF USERS TO COMMUNICATE SIMULTANEOUSLY OVER A LARGE AREA AT HIGH BIT RATES. UNFORTUNATELY, TDM AND CDMA ARE BOTH RESTRICTED BY ELECTRONICS WHICH PLACES A FUNDAMENTAL LIMITATION OF APPROXIMATELY 1-10 GB/S ON THROUGHPUT. TRADITIONAL WDM, HOWEVER, ALLOWS A HIGH LEVEL OF CONCURRENCY BETWEEN USERS AND COULD POTENTIALLY ACHIEVE 10-100 GB/S NETWORK THROUGHPUT. TECHNOLOGICAL DIFFICULTIES IN ACHIEVING BROAD-BAND TUNABLE LASER DIODES, OPTICAL FILTERS, AND DIFFICULTIES IN STABLIZING THE WAVELENGTHS IN GREAT NUMBERS OF WIDELY DISTRIBUTED LASER DIODES MAKE THIS SCHEME APPEAR AT LEAST 5-10 YEARS AWAY. INNOVATIVE IDEAS IN MULTI-HOP NETWORKS COMBINING THE PARALLELISM OF PARALLEL PROCESSING WITH THE EFFICIENCY OF PACKET SWITCHED LANS ALLOW A HIGH LEVEL OF CONCURRENCY WITH FEW OF THE FUNDAMENTAL OR TECHNOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS THAT PLAGUE THE ABOVE APPROACHES. POC'S APPROACH COMBINES THE FLEXIBILITY OF FREE-SPACE OR WAVEGUIDE-BASED HOLOGRAPHIC TECHNIQUES WITH THE MULTI-HOP NETWORK DESIGN TO REDUCE POWER LOSSES AND TO INCREASE INTERCONNECTIVITY. THIS LEADS TO INCREASED ROBUSTNESS, LOWER COST, AND INCREASED MAINTAINABILITY DUE TO A NUMBER OF REDUNDANT PATHS AND THE LIMITING OF THE NUMBER OF LASER DIODE WAVELENGTHS NEEDED. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - WDM MULTI-HOP NETWORKS HAVE WIDE RANGING APPLICABILITY TO BOTH MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL MARKETS.

STATIONARY CFD ENGINES FOR POWER PRODUCTION WILL HAVE TO COMPETE WITH OTHER CONVENTIONAL SOURCES OF SMALL POWER PRODUCTION. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, NOX EMISSIONS WILL HAVE TO BE REDUCED BY 60TO 80 PERCENT. TO IMPROVE ENERGY CONVERSION EFFICIENCY STATIONARY DIESEL ENGINES ARE EQUIPPED WITH TURBOCHARGERS. PARTICULATE ENTERING THE TURBOCHARGER MUST BE LESS THAN 5 TO 10 MUM IN DIAMETER TO MINIMIZE EROSION. PARTICLES IN THE ENGINE EXHAUST HAVE A MASS MEAN SIZE OF ABOUT 10 MUM AND TYPICALLY CONTAIN 70 TO 85 PERCENT CARBON. THEREFORE, SELECTIVELY REMOVING CARBON FROM THE PARTICULATE ENTERING THE TURBOCHARGER SHOULD REDUCE THE MEAN PARTICLE SIZE TO ABOUT 7 MUM. PREVIOUS WORK HAS SHOWN THAT NO CAN BE REDUCED TO N2 BY REACTION WITH COAL CHARS. WORK BY PSI TECHNOLOGY COMPANY (PSIT) HAS DEMONSTRATED 70 PERCENT NOX REDUCTION BY CFD PARTICULATE AT 750 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT, DURING WHICH THE CARBON WAS CONSUMED.

WE PROPOSE TO UTILIZE OUR UNIQUE PULSED FAST ATOM SOURCE TO DEVELOP DIAMOND COATINGS ON SUBSTRATES HELD AT LOW TEMPERATURES. OUR FAST BEAM CAN PROVIDE HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF C AND H ATOMS IN THE SAME RATIO AS UTILIZED IN PCVD PROCESSES BUT AT VERY HIGH VELOCITIES. UPON IMPACT THE HIGH VELOCITY, SHORT DURATION (?30 MICROMETER) BEAM WILL ACCOMODATE WITH THE SURFACE, HEATING A MOCROLAYER TO ELEVATE TEMPERATURES. THIS APPROACH AVOIDS THE REQUIREMENTS OF BULK SUBSTRTE HEATING. THE PHASE I EFFORT WILL BE DIRECTED TOWARDS A LABORATORY DEMONSTRATION FOR THE POTENTIAL OF USING OUR FAST BEAM TECHNOLOGY FOR DIAMOND COATING OF LOW TEMPERATURE SUBSTRATES. THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE PHASE I EFFORT WILL ALLOW THE UTILIZATION OF DIAMOND FILMS ON ADVANCED SUBSTRATES WHICH WOULD BE AFFECTED ADVERSELY BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS REQUIRED IN EXTANT DIAMOND COATING PROCESSES.",

IN PHASE I, IT IS PLANNED TO DEMONSTRATE TWO SEPARATE INNOVATIONS ADDRESSING THESE TWO PROBLEMS: (1) A NOVEL ENZYME IMMOBILIZATION PROCEDURE, AND (2) A NOVEL METHOD FOR QUANTITATIVE PEROXIDE DETECTION. TAKEN TOGETHER, THESE INNOVATIONS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT BIOSENSOR TECHNOLOGY FOR A VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS. PHASE I EFFORTS ARE DIRECTED TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF A GLUCOSE OXIDASE BIOSENSOR FOR GLUCOSE DETECTION, INCORPORATING THESE INNOVATIONS.

USING MULTIPLE SCINTILLATION DETECTORS OPERATING IN PARALLEL, THE PROPOSED INSTRUMENT WILL BE ABLE TO RESOLVE SPECTRAL FEATURES ALL THE WAY UP TO 1.3 MEV WHILE PROVIDING TIME RESOLUTION OF 1 NS OR BETTER. BY ANALYZING EACH SHOT OF THE FXR, EXPERIMENTERS WILL BE ABLE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND QUANTIFY MANY PHYSICAL PHENOMENA CURRENTLY NOT WELL KNOWN. THIS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE SIMULATION CAPABILITIES OFFERED BY NSWC AND SHOULD LEAD TO NEW AND BETTER WAYS OF TESTING MILITARY SYSTEMS TO THE EFFECTS OF HARD X-RAYS. THE PHASE I PROPOSAL AIMS TO DEMONSTRATE FEASIBILITY OF THE CONCEPT TO INCLUDE ACTUAL TESTS AT NSWC, ALBEIT ON A REDUCED CAPABILITY SENSOR. THEN, IF SUCCESSFUL, THE PHASE II PROGRAM WILL DEVELOP, BUILD, AND TEST A COMPLETE SENSOR HAVING A WIDE RANGE OF OPERATION. FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE NAVY WILL HAVE A MEANS FOR COMPLETELY CHARACTERIZING EACH FXR SHOT AS IT OCCURS WHICH WILL HELP MANY DIFFERENT USERS.",

WITH CHIP TO CHIP COMMUNICATION BOTTLENECKS ELIMINATED, POLYLITHICS MULTICHIP CIRCUITS OFFER DISTINCT PERFORMANCE ADVANTAGED OVER CONVENTIONAL PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD IMPLEMENTATIONS. PROPRIETARY REACH THROUGH VIA TECHNIQUES (RTV) USING SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING CREATE DIRECT CONNECTIONS TO THE CHIP SURFACE WHICH CAN BE 100 TIMES SMALLER THAN CONVENTIONAL BONDING PADS. THIS FEATURE DRAMATICALLY INCREASES THE NUMBER OF POSSIBLE SIGNALS PER CHIP AND ALLOWS DESIGNERS TO BUILD MORE PARALLEL ARCHITECTURES THAT INCREASE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE. SINCE THE JOINTS FORMED BY THIS APPROACH SUBSTANTIALLY RESEMBLE INTERNAL THIN FILM CHIP VIAS IT ADDS TO THE RELIABILITY OF THE SYSTEM. POLYLITHICS DIE ATTACHMENT TECHNIQUES PROVIDE A THERMAL PATH THROUGH THE CHIP BACKSIDE TO A HEAT SINK TOTALLY INDEPENDENT OF THE INTERCONNECT STRUCTURE THUS NO COMPROMISE BETWEEN WIRING CHANNELS AND HEAT PATH ARE REQUIRED.

THE DROPLETS WILL CONTAIN PH SENSITIVE DYE MOLECULES DISSOLVED IN HOST LIQUID CRYSTAL MOLECULES. PERMEATION OF HCL MOLECULES THROUGH THE ULTRATHIN ENCASING POLYMERIC SKIN OF THE DROPLETS WILL RESULT IN A PH DRIVEN COLOR CHANGE. THIS COLOR CHANGE, AND HENCE TOTAL HCL EXPOSURE, WILL BE MONITORED SPECTROPHOTOMETRICALLY AFTER SPECIFIED ELASPED PERIODS OF TIME. THE HCL DOISMETER BADGE WILL BE LIGHTWEIGHT (LESS THAN 1 OZ.), AND THUS PORTABLE. THE TECHNIQUE PROPOSED IS IDEAL FOR MASS PRODUCTION AND WILL RESULT IN THE PRODUCTION OF A RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE BADGE. THE TECHNOLOGY PROPOSED IS BASED ON RECENT ADVANCES IN MICROENCAPSULATION METHODS DEVELOPED IN OUR LABORATORIES. THESE ADVANCES INCLUDE THE ABILITY TO FINE CONTROL DROPLET SIZE AS WELL AS THE ABILITY TO ENCAPSULATE DYE MOLECULES AS GUEST MOLECULES IN A HOST LIQUID WITHIN THESE DROPLETS. THE FOCUS OF OUR PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL BE TO OPTIMIZE VARIABLES TO MAXIMIZE HCL DETECTION SENSITIVITY. THIS WILL INCLUDE IDENTIFICATION OF THE BEST PH INDICATOR DYE/HOST LIQUID CRYSTAL MIX, THE BEST POLYMERIC SKIN AND MINIMUM SKIN THICKNESS ATTAINABLE AND THE HCL SENSITIVITY OF THE DOSIMETER BADGE DEVELOPED. THE PHASE I EFFORT WILL TERMINATE WITH COMPLETION OF SAMPLE HCL DOSIMETER BADGES WHICH WILL BE SUBMITTED TO THE ARMY LABS AT FORT DETRICK FOR FURTHER TESTING.",

CURRENT MICROSCOPIES ARE UNLIKELY TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS. THIS PROJECT AIMS AT APPLYING NOVELMICROSCOPIES TO THE READ-OUT PROBLEM. IN PHASE I, IMAGES OF CELLS PRODUCED BY THE X-RAY LASER WILLBE EXAMINED BY NOMARSKI (NM), SCANNING ELECTRON (SEM), SCANNING TUNNELING (STM), AND ATOMIC FORCE (AFM) MICROSCOPIES TO ESTABLISH THE MOST EFFECTIVE METHODS OF MODIFYING THE STM WITH AN AFM-SENSING HEAD FOR READING OUT PHOTORESISTS. THE GOAL OF PHASE II WILL BE CONSTRUCTION OF A USER-FRIENDLYINSTRUMENT, BASED ON STM WITH AN AFM HEAD, FOR READ-OUT OF RESISTS WITH IMAGES OF BIOLOGICAL CELLS WITH ACCURACIES OF 10 NM. IN THE FINAL STAGES OF PHASE II, THIS INSTRUMENT WILL BE APPLIED TO IMMUNE SYSTEMS AND CANCER CELLS. LATER EFFORTS WILL PRODUCE A COMMERCIAL PROTOTYPE OF THE INSTRUMENT.",

THE PHYSICAL CHEMISTRYOF THE CAROTENOID FAMILY OF PIGMENTS WILL BE EVALUATED TO DETERMINE THE OPTIMAL CAROTENOID FOR ENHANCING PLAQUE ABLATION. IF PHASE I RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES FEASIBILITY AND LASER ABLATION BENEFITS FROM CAROTENOID LOADING OF PLAQUE, IN PHASE II IT IS PLANNED TO DEVELOP A PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION OF THE BEST CAROTENOID, DETERMINE THE OPTIMAL DOSAGE REGIMEN, AND EVALUATE ITS ABILITY TO ENHANCE SAFE, SELECTIVE LASER ABLATION OF PLAQUE IN CLINICAL TRIALS.",

RERTERIN HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE A POTENT, BROAD-SPECTRUM ANTIBACTERIAL,ANTIMYCOTIC AND ANTIPROTOZOAL AGENT. THE LACTOBACILLUS REUTERI-REUTERIN DISCOVERY IS UNDER INTERNATIONAL PATENT APPLICATION AND RIGHTS TO THIS SYSTEM HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED TO PROBIOLOGICS INTERNATIONAL, INC. AMONG THE POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS OF THIS DISCOVERY ARE TWO NOVEL PROCESSES FOR THE PRESERVATION OF FOODS: A MICROBIOLOGICAL PROCESS USING LACTOBACILLUS REUTERI FORMULATIONS AND A CHEMICAL PROCESS INVOLVING DIRECT ADDITION OF REUTERIN OR REUTERIN DERIVATIVES TO FOOD PRODUCTS. PRELIMINARY TESTS INDICATE THAT BOTH PROCESSES CAN BE FOUNDATIONS FOR A NEW TECHNOLOGY TO EXTEND THE SHELF LIFE OF HIGH QUALITY FOODS AND TO REDUCEOR ELIMINATE THE PRESENCE OF PATHOGENIC MICROORGANISMS IN THESE FOODS. SBIR FUNDING IS BEING SOUGHT TO CONDUCT BASICRESEARCH ON THE QUANTITATIVE PARAMETERS INVOLVED IN THESE NEW PROCESSES INCLUDING THE CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT PRODUCTION AND STABILITY OF REUTERIN AND ITS DERIVATIVES IN MEATS AND DAIRY PRODUCTS. WE BELIEVE THE PROPOSED RESEARCH COULD LEAD TO DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW FOOD PRESERVATION TECHNOLOGY HAVING WORLDWIDE COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS. AS GLOBAL DEMANDS FOR PRODUCTION OF HIGH QUALITY FOODS INCREASES, THE DEMAND THAT THESE FOODSBE WELL PRESERVED WILL ALSO INCREASE. IT WOULD BE COMPLIMENTARY TO EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES, USEABLE IN ALL GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OF THE WORLD AND APPLICABLE TO A WIDE- ASSORTMENT OF FOODS INCLUDING HIGHLY NUTRITIOUS BUT VERY PERISHABLE MATERIALS SUCH AS MEATS AND DAIRY PRODUCTS. WE BELIEVE THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY WILL BENEFIT PUBLIC HEALTH FROM A NUTRITIONAL PERSPECTIVE AND BY REDUCING NUMBERS OF POTENTIAL PATHOGENIC MICROORGANISMS FOUND IN CERTAIN FOODS.

INHIBITION OF THE BINDING OF HIV GP120 TO CD4 ON THE SURFACE OF TARGET CELLS, AS WELL AS INHIBITION OF GP120-CD4-MEDIATED CELL FUSION BETWEEN INFECTED AND UNINFECTED CELLS, ARE VERY PROMISING APPROACHES TO THE TREATMENT OF HIV INFECTION. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PHASE I PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A SCREENING ASSAY TO DETECT INHIBITORS OF THE INTERACTION OF HIV GP120 WITH CD4. THE DEVELOPMENT OF ASSAYS IN THIS RESEARCH WILL ENABLE THE LARGE-SCALE AUTOMATED SCREENING AND IDENTIFICATION IN PHASE II OF POTENTIAL ANTI-HIV THERAPEUTICS. THESE INHIBITORS WILL BE IMPORTANT CANDIDATESFOR FURTHER IN VITRO ANALYSIS AS WELL AS IN VIVO AND CLINICAL EVALUATION.",

THE FIRST GOAL WILL BE MET BY DEFINING AND MODELING A SCANNER POST-PROCESSOR TO CORRECT SCANNER OUTPUT FILES PRIOR TO THE AUTOTAGGING PROCESS. THE POST-PROCESSOR WILL ADJUST MISALIGNED TABLES, CONFORM BLANKS TO A STANDARD, ILSOLATE LITERATURE REFERENCE AND PERFORM NEEDED FILE CLEANUP. THE SECOND GOAL WILL BE MET BY IMPLEMENTING CONVERSION ROUTINES SUPPORTING IMPLEMENTATION OF AN INNOVATIVE SYSTEM CONCEPT FOR HIGH SPEED ELECTRONIC INFORMATION RETRIEVAL AND SCREEN DISPLAY. THE THIRD GOAL WILL BE MET BY USING DOD CALS STANDARDS AS A FOUNDATION FOR NEW SOFTWARE. WE WILL TEST USEABILITY OF THOSE STANDARDS FOR ELECTRONIC INFORMATION RETRIEVAL AND DISPLAY.",

IN THIS CONCEPT, A CHARGE-COUPLED DEVICE (CCD) SAMPLES THE RECEIVED SIGNAL AND DETECTS THE UNIQUE SYNCHRONIZATION WORD.UPON UNIQUE-WORD DETECTION, THE TIMING OF THE DATA BURST IS DETERMINED, AND THE CCD DEVICE TEMPORARILY STORES THE BURST-SIGNAL SAMPLES. THESE SIGNAL SAMLES ARE THEN OUTPUT AT A SLOWER RATE COMPATIBLE WITH A MICROPROCESSOR, SIGNAL PROCESSOR, OR OTHER LOW-DATA-RATE DEMODULATOR. THIS DEVICE PROMISES TO GREATLY SIMPLIFY THE CIRCUITRY OF TIME-DIVISION MULTIPLE ACCESS (TDMA) AND OTHER BURST-DATA DEMODULATORS FORGOVERNMENTAL AND COMMERCIAL COMMUNICATIONS. IT CAN BE USED IN A TDMA RECEIVER TO ACHIEVE A LOW COMPLEXITY WITH A LOW AVERAGE DATA RATE AND VERY HIGH INSTANTANEOUS DATA RATE, E.G., 1500 MEGABITS PER SECOND. THIS EFFORT COULD BE THE BASIS FOR APPLICATIONS IN TDMA LOW-COST GROUND TERMINALS, HIGH-CAPACITY TDMA RECEIVERS, RANDOM-ACCESS PACKET RECEIVERS, AND OTHER BURST SIGNAL SYSTEMS. THE APPROACH ALLOWS VERY SMALL, LOW-POWER, BURST-MODULATION,MULTIPLE-ACCESS TERMINALS, E.G. HAND-HELD OR SINGLE BOARD DEMODULATORS.",

THOUGH INITIAL MCMS ARE SMALLER, IT IS CLEAR THAT MID 1990S MCMS WILL EXTEND TO AT LEAST 6\" SIZES, OPERATING AT 100 TO 200 MHZ CLOCK RATES FOR CMOS (MUCH HIGHER FOR GAAS). A CRITICAL PROBLEM WITH THESE LARGE MCMS IS THAT, WHILE THE REQUIRED INTERCONNECT DENSITIES REQUIRE THE USE OF FAIRLY FINE LINEWIDTHS (-5 UM TYPICALLY), EVEN WHEN IMPLEMENTED IN COPPER OR GOLD THESE LINES BECOME VERY ATTENUATING, DISTORTIVE AND SLOW BEYOND LENGTHS OF A FEW INCHES. THE USE OF HIGH TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTORS FOR THE SIGNAL LINES WOULD VIRTUALLY COMPLETELY ELIMINATE SIGNAL LINE ATTENUATION AT FREQUENCIES OF INTEREST, EVEN AT 1 UM LINEWIDTHS (ALLOWING INCREASED DENSITIES), PLUS PROVIDING NEAR-PERFECT SHIELDING FOR MIXED-MODE ANALOG/DIGITAL MCMS. CURRENTLY, HOWEVER, HTSC FILMS ARE EPITAXIALLY GROWN ON HIGH ER SUBSTRATES, WHEREAS MCMS REQUIRE A MULTI-LAYER INTERCONNECT TECHNOLOGY WITH LOW ER DIELECTRICS. THE GOAL OF THE PROPOSED STUDY IS TO IDENTIFYD PROMISING TECHNICAL APPROACHES TO FABRICATING HTSC MULTI-LAYER INTERCONNECTS FOR HIGH DENSITY MCMS OR BACKPLANES. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PRACTICAL 80 DEGREE K HTSC MULTI-LAYER INTERCONNECT TECHNOLOGY WILL MAKE POSSIBLE LARGE, HIGH DENSITY MCMS FOR HIGH SPEED CMOS OR GAAS DIGITAL (OR MIXED-MODE) SYSTEM APPLICATIONS. THIS TECHNOLOGY SHOULD SEE APPLICATION IN A WIDE RANGE OF MILITARY SYSTEMS, AS WELL AS COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS, ASSUMING THE AVAILABILITY OF EFFICIENT, INEXPENSIVE 80 DEGREE K REFRIGERATORS.

GEANT, ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED IN THE 1970S, HAS EMERGED AS A STANDARD TOOL FOR DETECTOR SIMULATION; IT IS SUFFICIENTLY VERSATILE (BY VIRTUE OF ITS GENERAL AND FLEXIBLE GEOMETRY PACKAGE) TO BE USED AT ALL STAGES OF THE DETECTOR DESIGN PROCESS, MERELY BY ADJUSTING THE GRANULARITY OF ITS INPUT. UNFORTUNATELY, THE SUBSTANTIAL EFFORT (OFTEN, MANY PERSON-MONTHS) REQUIRED TO CREATE GEANT INPUT FILES WILL ONLY INCREASE FOR THE NEW GENERATION OF LARGE, COMPLEX DETECTORS THAT MUST SOON BE DESIGNED FOR THE SUPERCONDUCTING SUPER COLLIDER. THE ADVENTOF CAD AND POWERFUL GRAPHICS PACKAGES HAS PROVIDED A WELCOME ASSIST TO THE DETECTOR SIMULATION COMMUNITY, BUT THE BENEFIT IS FAR FROM FULLY REALIZED, SINCE DETECTOR GEOMETRY INPUT IS SUBJECT TO WASTEFUL DOUBLE ENTRY (ONCE INTO THE CAD SYSTEM, IN ITS FORMAT, AND THEN INTO GEANT, IN ITS). THUS, THE APPLICANTS SEEK TO DEVELOP A GENERIC, PROFESSIONAL INTERFACE CODE THAT CAN BE USED WITH COMMERCIAL CAD PACKAGES TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE TIME AND LABOR INVOLVED IN CREATING GEANT GEOMETRY INPUT FILES FOR LARGE-SCALE DETECTORS. IT SHOULD EVENTUALLY BE POSSIBLETO INCORPORATE SEVERAL USEFUL FEATURES INTO THIS INTERFACE, SUCH AS GEOMETRY-CHECKING ROUTINES, ENGINEERING AND PHYSICS RULES OF GOOD PRACTICE, AND PRELIMINARY COST-ESTIMATING CAPABILITY.",

SUCH MEASUREMENT IS NOW PRECLUDED BY THE OVERWHELMING FLUORESCENCE SIGNAL FROM THE DOMINANT ELEMENT. THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUE WOULD EMPLOY A PRIMARY PHOTON SOURCE, A SECONDARY FLUORESCER, ONE OR MORE FILTERS, AND DIFFERENTIAL ANALYSIS OF THE OBSERVED SPECTRA. THE KEY FEATURES OF THE TECHNIQUE ARE (1) REDUCTION OF THE FLUORESCENCE FROM THE INTERFERING ELEMENT BY APPROPRIATELY SHIFTING THE INCIDENT ENERGY BELOW THE EXCITATION OF THE DOMINANT (K) X RAYS AND (2) INCORPORATION OF SECONDARY EFFECTS BY USE OF A DIFFERENCING SCHEME. AS ANINITIAL DEMONSTRATION OF THE TECHNIQUE, WE WILL ATTEMPT TO SHOW THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO DETECT MANAGANESE (Z=25) AT THE 1% LEVEL IN CARBON STEEL HAVING 98% IRON (Z=26).

MOST POLYACRYLAMIDES ARE UNSTABLE IN THE HARD BRINES IN MOST RESERVOIRS IN THE REGION DUE TO THE HIGH CONCENTRATION OF CALCIUM AND MAGNESIUM CATIONS. IN MANY CASES THE POLYMERS CANNOT WITHSTAND THE TEMPERATURES ABOVE 165 FAHRENHEIT. IN OKLAHOMA ANY EOR PROJECT USING FRESH WATER WILL NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE SEVEN PERCENT EXCLUSION IN STATE SEVERANCE TAXES. IT THEREFORE BECOMES IMPORTANT FOR INDUSTRY TO DEVELOP A NEW TYPE OF WATER SOLUBLE POLYMER THAT CAN BE MIXED IN TYPICAL FIELD BRINES FOR EOR PROJECTS. PHASE I WILL COMPRISE A SYSTEMATIC PREPARATION AND TESTING OF A SERIES OF NEW COPOLYMERS WHICH HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE IN THE MID-CONTINENT RESERVOIRS. THE COPOLYMERS WILL CONTAIN LARGE AMOUNTS OF THE ACRYLAMIDE MONOMER WHICH IS LOW COST AND READILY AVAILABLE.

BECAUSE EXCISION REPAIR PROCESSES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO DEMONSTRATE THE PRESENCE OF DNA LESIONS AND BECAUSE SAMPLE SIZES CAN BE EXTREMELY SMALL (1 TO <10(5)), THE SINGLE-CELL GEL TECHNIQUESHOULD BE SUPERIOR TO OTHER METHODS CURRENTLY USED TO EVALUATE DNA DAMAGE IN GERM CELLS. FURTHERMORE, BECAUSE DATA ARE COLLECTED AT THE LEVEL OF THE SINGLE CELL, AN ASSESSMENT OF INTERCELLULAR DIFFERENCES IN DAMAGE CAN BE CONDUCTED, MAKING IT MORE INFORMATIVE THAN BIOCHEMICAL TECHNIQUES BASED ON POOLED CELL SAMPLES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO EVALUATE THE SUITABILITY OF THIS TECHNIQUE FOR DETECTING DNA DAMAGE IN THE CELLS OF MALE MICE EXPOSED TO POSSIBLE MUTAGENS. THE FOCUS OF THE PROJECT WILL BE ON THE VARIOUS METHODS USED TO ISOLATE GERM CELLS FROM THE TESTIS AND THE KINETICS OF THE INDUCTION OF DNA DAMAGE INDUCED BY SELECTED MUTAGENIC AGENTS (ACRYLAMIDE,CIS-PLATINUM, CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE, AND METHYLMETHANESULFONATE).",

STABLE CLUSTERS OF CARBON HAVE BEEN OBSERVED AND A UNIQUE SPHERICAL STRUCTURE SIMILAR TO THAT OF A SOCCER BALL HAS BEEN PROPOSED FOR THEM. CARBON CLUSTERS ARE GIVEN THE NAME FULLERENES AFTER THE MOST HIGHLY SYMMETRICAL ONE KNOWN AS BUCKMINSTERFULLERENE, C60. FULLERENES ARE INTERESTING BOTH FROM AN ACADEMIC STANDPOINT AND FOR THEIR POSSIBLE PRACTICALUSES. FOR EXAMPLE, THEY WOULD BE THE ONLY SPHERICAL MOLECULES KNOWN WITH AROMATIC STABILITY. FULLERENES HAVE POTENTIAL PRACTICAL USES AS HIGH-TEMPERATURE, OXIDATION-RESISTANT LUBRICANTS AND CATALYSTS.

THE RESEARCH WOULDDETERMINE PRELIMINARY STRUCTURAL AND THERMAL DESIGN OF MODULAR PANELS, LIFE CYCLE COSTS, AND OVERALL CONCEPT FEASIBILITY. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL LEAD TO A MORE PRODUCTIVE REFRIGERATED SHIPPING CONTAINER THROUGH THE USE OF SUPERIOR INSULATION OF REDUCED THICKNESS, AND THROUGHDEVELOPMENT OF MODULAR INSULATION PANELS THAT ARE EASILY ASSEMBLED IN THE FACTORY OR REPAIRED IN THE FIELD.

THE DESIGN OF THE RAKE PROBE AND ELEMENTS REQUIRES THAT THEY BE ABLE TO SURVIVE THE SEVERE ENVIRONMENT PRESENT IN AN ARC JET FACILITY.

THESE TWO GOALS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH A NEW, HELICAL GEOMETRY FOR MODELING THE RADAR BACKSCATTER FROM POWER LINES. BY UTILIZING POLARIMETRIC SYNTHESIS, THE RADAR SIGNATURE OF THE CABLE CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED WITH RESPECT TO ITS BACKGROUND. EXISTING DATASET APPROPRIATE FOR TESTING THE NEW WIRE EXTRACTION TECHNIQUE WILL BE IDENTIFIED. IN PHASE II, A SYSTEM FOR PERFORMING THE EXTRACTION WILL BE IMPLEMENTED. THE WIRE LOCATION INFORMATION WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE INTEGRATED WITH COMMERCIAL GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS DURING PHASE III. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - POWER LINE COLLISION AVOIDANCE, REMOTE MAPPING OF POWER LINES, IMPROVED SAR DESIGN. KEY WORDS - POLARIMETRY, TRANSMISSION WIRE, SAR, POLARIZATION SYNTHESIS, BACKSCATTER MODEL, RADAR IMAGERY, POWER LINE.",

IT IS GENERALLY ACCEPTED THAT A NUMBER OF UPSTREAM PROCESS VARIABLES IMPACT THE GEOMETRY AND, THEREFORE, THE PERFORMANCE OF CIRCUIT OARD SOLDER JOINTS. A CLEAR DEFINITION OF THIS RELATIONSHIP, HOWEVER, HAS NOT YET BEEN DEVELOPED DUE TO THE UNAVAILABILITY OF ACCURATE DIMENSIONAL MEASUREMENTS OF SOLDER JOINT GEOMETRY. RECENT BREAKTHROUGHS BY RVSI IN THREE-DIMENSIONAL MACHINE VISION TECHNOLOGY HAVE ALLOWED, FOR THE FIRST TIME, HIGH RESOLUTION MEASUREMENTS OF SOLDER GEOMETRY, CREATING THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP A DEFINITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN UPSTREAM PROCESS VARIABLES AND DOWNSTREAM SOLDER JOINT CHARACTERISTICS. WITH THIS NEW UNDERSTANDING, A REAL-TIME SOLDER PROCESS CONTROL SYSTEM COULD BE IMPLEMENTED, ALLOWING A REDUCTION IN PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD DEFECTS. THE PROPOSED PROGRAM WOULD BEGIN THE EFFORT NECESSARY TO CREATE SUCH A CIRCUIT BOARD PROCESS CONTROL SYSTEM BY PROVIDING CIRCUIT BOARD PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT VARIABLES AND THE QUALITY OF THE FINISHED PRODUCT.",

THIS INVOLVES STRUCTURING THE MEASUREMENT, STORAGE, REDUCTION, AND OUTPUT OF THE DATA INTO AN EASILY MANAGED SYSTEM, SUITABLE FOR SMALL AND LARGE ENGINEERING FIRMS. THE PROJECT HAS TWO MAIN GOALS. ONE IS TO INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING A DISTANCE MEASURING DEVICE THAT CORRECTS FOR SYSTEMATIC ERRORS CAUSED BY HUMIDITY AND AIR TURBULENCE. THIS DEVICE IS THE SUBJECT OF PHASE II AND III RESEARCH. THE SECOND GOAL IS TO INVESTIGATE AND IMPLEMENT A UNIVERSAL CLOSURE ALGORITHM THAT EFFICIENTLY USES REDUNDANT DATA BY PROPERLY APPLYING WEIGHTING FACTORS IN PROPORTION TO EXPECTED ERRORS. WE WILL DEVELOP A NONLINEAR MODEL FOR THE ERRORS THAT INCLUDES THE GEOMETRY OF THE NET, THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INSTRUMENTS, AND THE PHYSICS OF THE MEASUREMENT. WE WILL BASE AND TEST OUR MODEL USING FIELD DATA. FROM OVER FIFTEEN YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AND THROUGH ASSOCIATION WITH OTHER PROFESSIONAL SURVEYORS, WE RECOGNIZE A GREAT NEED FOR SUCH A PROGRAM.",

IN THIS FEASIBILITY STUDY, WE WILL TEST THE PRACTICALITY AND RELEVANCE OF OUR SYSTEM TO RAILROAD PERSONNEL. WE WILL TEST SEVEN TRAIN ENGINEERS TWICE A WEEK FOR 6 WEEKS. EACH ENGINEER WILL BE TESTED AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF HIS SHIFT, AND THE DATA WILL BE ANALYZED FOR CONSTRUCT VALIDITY ON SUBJECTIVE MENTAL STATUS,RETEST RELIABILITY, DAY-TO-DAY VARIABILITY, AND INTER-INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY. WE WILL ALSO MAKE A PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF THE SENSITIVITY OF THE TESTS TO CHANGES IN CFA DUE TO FATIGUE BETWEEN THE BEGINNING AND END OF THE WORKSHIFT. IF SUCCESSFUL, THE COST OF IMPLEMENTING SUCH A SYSTEM WILL BE MINIMAL COMPARED TO THE HUMAN AND EQUIPMENT COSTS INCURRED BY THE RAILROAD FROM ACCIDENTS DUE TO HUMAN ERROR. UNLIKE URINE, BREATH OR BLOOD TESTS, OUR SYSTEM WILL DIRECTLY MEASURE THE COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS UNDERLYING THE SKILLS REQUIRED FOR SAFE AND EFFECTIVE PERFORMANCE ON THE JOB. THE PROPOSED COMPUTERIZED SYSTEM WILL BE CAPABLE OF DETECTING COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE IMPAIRMENTS DUE TO FATIGUE OR ILLNESS NOT CURRENTLY POSSIBLE WITH EXISTING METHODS, IN ADDITION TO DETECTING IMPAIRMENTS RESULTING FROM DRUG OR ALCOHOL USE. ASSESSMENTS WILL BE MADE IN LESS THAN 3 MINUTES. BECAUSE OF ITS PORTABILITY, EASE OF USE, AND BREVITY, THE SYSTEMN MAY ALSO BE USED IN THE CONTEXT OF MONITORING PERFORMANCE THROUGHOUT THE DURATION OF WORKSHIFTS. EACH OF THESE APPLICATIONS WILL INCREASE SAFETY AND REDUCE OVERALL OPERATING COSTS FOR THE RAILROAD, AND ALL AGENCIES UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP ACOUSTOGRAPHY, A NEW IMAGING METHOD, TO AID IN THE DETECTIONAND CHARACTERIZATION OF BREAST CANCER. ACOUSTOGRAPHY USES ULTRASOUND TO PRODUCE FULL-FIELD PROJECTION IMAGES OF THE BREAST IN A MANNER THAT IS ANALOGOUS TO X-RAY MAMMOGRAPHY. AN \"ACOUSTO-OPTICAL\" LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAY, ANALOGOUS TO A FLUOROSCOPIC SCREEN, IS USED TO VISUALIZE AND RECORD THE ULTRASONIC IMAGE OF THE ENTIRE BREAST. THE SPECIFIC AIM IN PHASE I WILL BE TO USE BREAST PHANTOMS TO EVALUATE ACOUSTOGRAPHY. TISSUE-MIMICKING MATERIALS CURRENTLY USED FOR PRODUCING PHANTOMS TO EVALUATE CONVENTIONAL ULTRASONOGRAPHY EQUIPMENT WILL BE USED TO PRODUCE BREAST PHANTOMS SUITABLE FOR ACOUSTOGRAPHIC STUDIES. COMMERCIALLY, ACOUSTOGRAPHY OFFERS PHYSICIANS A MUCH MORE PRACTICAL WAY OF GENERATING ULTRASONIC IMAGES BECAUSE THE ENTIRE BREAST CAN BE IMAGED WITH ONLY ONE OR TWO IMAGES, AND THE IMAGE FORMAT ALLOWS DIRECT SIDE-BY-SIDE COMPARISON OF THE ULTRASONIC AND X-RAY BREAST IMAGES. COMPARED TO GENERAL-PURPOSE SCANNERS, ACOUSTOGRAPHY IS MORE REPEATABLE BECAUSE THE PROCEDURE CAN BE STANDARDIZED SIMILARLY TO AN X-RAY MAMMOGRAPHY EXAMINATION. COMPARED TO DEDICATED SCANNERS, ACOUSTOGRAPHY IS COST EFFECTIVE AND OFFERS HIGH PATIENT THROUGHPUT; THE ENTIRE BREAST INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE IN SECONDS ON ONE OR TWO IMAGES, ASOPPOSED TO 100 TO 150 IMAGES IN DEDICATED SCANNERS.",

THIS REPRESENTS AN IMPROVEMENT OVER CURRENT TECHNIQUES, IN THAT THE COMPRESSIVE FORCE ON THE WASHER IS A DIRECT MEASURE OF THE TENSION IN THE BOLT. CONSEQUENTLY, CALIBRATION TO ACCOUNT FOR BOLT PARAMETERS SUCH AS LENGTH, STRESSED LENGTH, DIAMETER, VELOCITY OF SOUND, TENSILE STIFFNESS, AND SURFACE CHARACTERISTICS IS NOT NECESSARY.

THE OBJECTIVES ARE TO LEARN IF THIS METHOD CAN PRODUCE THE FILMS AT AN ACCEPTABLE RATE, OVER USEFUL AREAS, AND WITH SUFFICIENT REFLECTANCE TO SHOW PROMISE FOR MIRROR APPLICATIONS IMPORTANT TO NASA'S SPACE ASTRONOMY MISSIONS. THE GJD METHOD EXPLOITS SUPERSONIC GAS JETS TO DEPOSIT THIN FILMS OF METALS, SEMICONDUCTORS, INSULATORS, AND ORGANIC MATERIALS AT HIGH RATES ON LOW- TEMPERATURE SUBSTRATES. THE GAS-JET SOURCES WILL BE MODIFIED TO SUSTAIN MICROWAVE DISCHARGES FOR PLASMA-ASSISTEDDEPOSITION OR EQUIPPED WITH TARGETS FOR LASER VAPORIZATION. DURING DEPOSITION, THE FILMS WILL BE ANNEALED BY PULSED- LASER HEATING AND BY BOMBARDMENT WITH HIGH FLUXES OF MODERATE-ENERGY NEUTRAL SPECIES. IN ADDITION, A NEW APPROACH TO COVERAGE OF LARGE AREAS BY THE PERIODIC DEFLECTION OF THE GAS JETS WILL BE TESTED. THE OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF THE FILMS WILL BE CHARACTERIZED. APPLICATION MAY BE FOUND IN OPTICAL COMPONENTS FOR X-RAY LITHOGRAPHY, SYNCHROTRON BEAM LINES, AND SILICON-CARBIDE COATINGS FOR ELECTRONIC, PHOTONIC, AND WEAR APPLICATIONS.",

TO BE SERVICEABLE IN NEUROLOGICALLY HANDICAPPED SUBJECTS, SUCH MICROPROBES REQUIRE LONG-TERM PROTECTION FROM REACTIVE EXTRACELLULAR FLUIDS; SILICON NITRIDE FILMS ARE EXCELLENT BARRIERS TO WATER AND ALKALINE IONS. GJD USES SUPERSONIC GAS JETS TO CONVECT SPECIES TO UNHEATED SUBSTRATES WHERE DEPOSITION CAN OCCUR AT NEAR ROOM TEMPERATURE. THIS IS USEFUL FOR ENCAPSULATING MICROPROBE ASSEMBLIES WHERE MATERIALS OF LOW THERMAL STABILITY, E.G., POLYMERS, ARE PRESENT. SILICON NITRIDE FILMS MADE BY LOW-TEMPERATURE REACTIVE GJD ARE FOUND TO BE HARD, ADHERENT,PINHOLE FREE, AND OF HIGH BREAKDOWN STRENGTH. SILICON NITRIDE FILMS WILL BE DEPOSITED ON TEST STRUCTURES THAT SIMULATE THE TOPOGRAPHICAL AND CHEMICAL FEATURES OF MICROPROBES AND THEN WILL BE TESTED FOR CHEMICAL, ELECTRICAL, AND MECHANICAL STABILITY IN IONIC SOLUTION. POSITIVE RESULTS IN PHASE I WILL BE A PRELUDE TO THE COATING AND TESTING OF ACTUAL MICROPROBE ASSEMBLIES IN PHASEII. REACTIVE GJD IS EASILY ADAPTED AS A COMMERCIAL ENCAPSULATION PROCESS.",

SINGLE-FREQUENCY, RING-LASER OPERATION WOULD PERMIT EFFICIENT EXTRACTION OF THE SECOND-HARMONIC OUTPUT AND ALSO MINIMIZE POTENTIAL AMPLITUDE NOISE DUE TO LONGITUDINAL MODE-BEATING. THE TASKS INVOLVED WOULD BE THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A CW ND:YAG GAIN MODULE, PUMPED BY A 10-W DIODE LASER BAR, THE CONSTRUCTION AND EVALUATION OF A UNIDIRECTIONAL RING LASER, THE EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION OF HARMONIC GENERATION IN TYPE I, NONCRITICALLY PHASE-MATCHED KNBO3, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF A POINT DESIGN FOR A 3-W, CW BLUE LASER OPERATING AT 473 NM. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - APPLICATIONS IN LARGE-SCREEN PROJECTION, PRINTING, REPROGRAPHICS, CELL COUNTING, MICROSCOPY FLUORESCENCE AND RAMAN ANALYSIS, SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTATION, OPTICAL MEMORIES AND CLINICAL MEDICINE ARE AMONG THE MOST OBVIOUS FOR THE PROPOSED LASER.

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE EXPANDING BEAM LASER (EBL) CONCEPT IS A REVOLUTIONARY METHOD FOR FABRICATING EFFICIENT, LIGHTWEIGHT, COMPACT CO2 LASERS FOR SPACEBASED LASER RADAR APPLICATIONS. THE MAIN ADVANTAGE OF THIS CONCEPT IS THAT IT ENABLES THE CONSTRUCTION OF LASER POWER AMPLIFIERS HAVING STAGE GAINS THAT ARE FACTORS OF 10-30 GREATER THAN WITH CONVENTIONAL APPROACHES. IN THE CASE OF THE CO2 LASER, EFFICIENT POWER AMPLIFIERS WITH GAINS OF 1000 CAN BE BUILT WITH NO ISOLATIONAND WITH NEGLIGIBLE LOSSES FROM AMPLIFIED SPONTANEOUS EMISSION. AS A RESULT THE OSCILLATOR THAT PROVIDES THE INJECTED SIGNAL FOR A MASTER OSCILLATOR - POWER AMPLIFIER (MOPA) CAN BE REDUCED IN ENERGY BY A FACTOR OF 10-30 THEREBY REDUCING THE OVERALL LASER WEIGHT AND VOLUME BY A FACTOR OF NEARLY 2. TWO TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES WILL BE COMPLETED DURING PHASE I. (A) DETAILED ENGINEERING DESIGN OF A CO2 LASER MOPA USING THE EBL ARCHITECTURE. (B) VERIFICATION THAT THE EBL AMPLIFIER RESULTS IN THE LIGHTEST,MOST COMPACT LASER RADAR SYSTEM THROUGH EXTENSIVE LASER MODELLING AND BY ESTIMATING THE SIZE AND WEIGHT OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE LASER SYSTEM FOR BOTH THE EBL AND CONVENTIONAL LASER ARCHITECTURES. USING THESE CONCEPTUAL DESIGNS, A PROOF-OF-PRINCIPLE EXPERIMENT WILL ALSO BE DESIGNED IN PHASE I.",

WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP AN EFFICIENTOUT-OF-CORE VERSION OF OUR POWERFUL SPARSE PRECONDITIONED CONJUGATE GRADIENT ITERATIVE METHOD PACKAGE, PCGPAK. THIS WILL INVOLVE THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW ALGORITHMS WHICH ATTEMPT TO MINIMIZE DISK TRAFFIC AND OVERLAP REQUIRED READS WRITES WITH COMPUTATION AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. OUR ANALYSIS LEADS US TO BELIEVE THAT WE CAN DEVELOP A PACKAGE WHOSE PERFORMANCE WILL BE CPU BOUND (AS DISTINCT FROM I/O BOUND) ON MOST REASONABLY BALANCED COMPUTER SYSTEMS FOR MOST PROBLEMS OF COMMON INTEREST. AN OUT-OF-CORE PCGPAK WOULD ALLOW USERS TO SOLVE ARBITRARILY LARGE SPARSE LINEAR SYSTEM WITH GREAT SPEED WITHOUT PAYING THE PENALTY OF USING SECONDARY STORAGE DEVICES. FURTHERMORE USERS WOULD NOT HAVE TO CONCERN THEMSELVES WITH THE INTRICATE DETAILS INVOLVED WITH EFFICIENT I/O PROGRAMMING. AN OUT-OF-CORE PCGPAK HAS OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL. THE OIL INDUSTRY IS A CONCRETE EXAMPLE OF WHERE SUCH A PACKAGE WOULD BE USED IMMEDIATELY. ALL COMMERCIAL SIMULATE HAVE AN \"EVERYTHING BUT THE LINEAR SYSTEM\" OUT-OF-CORE OPTION NOW AND WOULD INCLUDE AN OUT-OF-CORE LINEAR SYSTEM SOLVER -- IF AN ADEQUATE ONE EXISTED.

THE PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO BE USED BY PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCHERS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN RESOLVING CLINICAL AND BIOLOGICAL HETEROGENEITY IN OTHERWISE HOMOGENEOUS PATIENT SAMPLES (E.G., PATIENTS WITH THE SAME DSM-III DIAGNOSIS). PARTICULAR ATTENTION WILL BE PAYED TO THE PROBLEMS OF ASSESSING MODEL FIT, THE INFLUENCE OF OUTLIERS, AND COMPARISON OF ALTERNATIVE MODELS (E.G., SINGLE-COMPONENT VERSUS MULTICOMPONENT DISTRIBUTIONS). THE COMPUTER PROGRAM WILL BE SUPPLIED WITH A MANUAL THAT PROVIDES DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF ALL COMMANDS AND A SERIES OF ILLUSTRATIONS THAT WILL BE SUPPLIED ON A DISKETTE IN THE FORM OF A TUTORIAL. AN EXAMPLE ILLUSTRATION WILL BE THE DERIVATION OF AN OPTIMAL CUT-POINT FOR THE DEXAMETHASONE SUPPRESSION TEST, BASED ON FITTING A MIXTURE OF TWO NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS TO POSTDEXAMETHASONE PLASMA CORTISOL.",

PERSONNEL LOSSES ARE COSTLY BECAUSE THEY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO MUST BE RECRUITED AND TRAINED. MORE SERIOUS IS THE PROSPECT OF MILITARY MISSIONS DEGRADED BY MANPOWER SHORTAGES. THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF FORECASTING METHODOLOGIES IN USE AT THE PRESENT TIME. FOR EXAMPLE ORDINARY LEAST SQURES STEPWISE REGRESSION BASED ON INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS AND A VERSION OF ODDS-FOR-EFFECTIVENESS TABLES TO ESTIMATE ATTRITION PROBABILITY ARE USED BY AIR FORCE AND NAVY TO PREDICT LOSSES ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. IN ALL THESE CASES THERE ARE SOME PREJUDICES OF THE RESEARCHERS BUILT INTO THE MODEL AND IT IS TIME TO STUDY MODELS WHICH LOOK ONLY AT THE DATA AND NOTHING ELSE. NEURAL NETWORK TECHNOLOGY HAS GIVEN US THIS PRIVILEGE OF CREATING MODELS WHICH TRAIN THEMSELVES ON THE DATA AND THERE BY REMOVING ALL THE ASSUMPTIONS BUILT INTO CURRENT FORECASTING TECHNIQUES. DARPA NEURAL NETWORK STUDY RECOMMENDS GMDH AS ONE OF THE MOST USEFUL TECHNIQUES IN CLASSIFICATION AND MODELING. WE HAVE DEVELOPED A TECHNIQUE FOR FURTHER REFINEMENT ON THE GMDH TECHNIQUE WHICH INCORPORATES DIFFERENT TYPES OF LEARNING TECHNIQUES, ENABLING US TO CREATE A NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURE WITH OPTIMAL COMPLEXITY.

THESE EFFECTS CAUSE NONLINEAR DISTORTION OF THE MODULATION AND TEND TO CLOSE THE \"EYE\" OF THE DEMODULATED DATA. SCS HAS PERFORMED INITIAL RESEARCH USING A NONLINEAR ADAPTIVE EQUALIZER WHICH OPENS THE \"EYE\". FINALLY, WE WILL SELECT, THE OPTIMUM MODULATION SCHEME FOR A GIVEN CODE RATE. A SUCCESSFUL EFFORT WILL RESULT IN FAR MORE EFFICIENT COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS FOR THE SPACE STATION.

BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST OF PREPARING THESE GLYCOPROTEINS, A MEANS FOR ACHIEVING AN ENHANCED IMMUNE RESPONSE IS AN IMPORTANT OBJECTIVE AND IS THE FOCUS OF THIS RESEARCH. BIOCOMPATIBLE AND BIODEGRADABLE MICROSPHERES CONSISTING OF ACOPOLYMER OF DL-LACTIDE AND GLYCOLIDE (POLY DL-LACTIDE-CO-GLYCOLIDE) WILL BE UTILIZED TO INCORPORATE INACTIVATED HUMAN PARAINFLUENZA TYPE 3 (PI3) VIRUS ANTIGENS INTO SMALL SPHERICAL PARTICLES (1-10 MU M). MICROSPHERES CONTAINING VIRAL ANTIGENS WILL BE USED FOR SUBCUTANEOUS, INTRANASAL, AND ORAL IMMUNIZATION OF EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS, AND THEIR IMMUNE RESPONSE WILL BE EVALUATED. A DIFFERENT GROUP OF ANIMALS WILL BE SIMILARLY IMMUNIZED WITH INACTIVATED VIRUS IN SOLUTION FOR COMPARISON. IF A SIGNIFICANT ENHANCEMENT IN THE PROTECTIVE IMMUNE RESPONSE IS OBSERVED USING MICROENCAPSULATED PI3 VIRUS ANTIGENS, MORE DETAILED STUDIES WILL BE SUBSEQUENTLY PURSUED FOR DEVELOPMENT OF A MULTIVALENT SUBUNIT VACCINE USING PARAINFLUENZA TYPE 1, 2, AND 3 ENVELOPE GLYCOPROTEINS. STUDIES WILL ALSO BE CONDUCTED TO UNDERSTANDTHE MECHANISM OF PROTECTION AND THE DURATION OF SUCH RESPONSE. FINALLY, MICROENCAPSULATED VIRUS ENVELOPE GLYCOPROTEINS WILL BE UTILIZED FOR A CLINICAL FIELD TRIAL FOR IMMUNOPROPHYLAXIS AGAINST NATURAL INFECTION FROM PARAINFLUENZA VIRUSES.",

UNLIKE TRADITIONAL METHODS OF COMPOSITE MEMBRANE PREPARATION, WHERE THE MEMBRANE BARRIER IS FORMED ON THE SURFACE OF A POROUS MEMBRANE SUPPORT, THE PROPOSED METHOD OF MEMBRANE PREPARATION INVOLVES THE FORMATION OF THE PERMSELECTIVE BARRIER WITHIN THE PORES OF THE MICROPOROUS SUPPORT. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY A PROCESS OF OCCLUSION OR PORE-FILLING, WHEREBY THE REVERSE SIDE OF A FABRIC-REINFORCED MICROPOROUS MEMBRANE IS CONTACTED WITH A DILUTE SOLUTION OF A POLYMER WITH DESIRABLE TRANSPORT PROPERTIES. THE SOLUTION IS SUBSEQUENTLY DRAWN INTO THE FINE SURFACE PORES BY CAPILLARY ACTION AND THE POLYMER IS DEPOSITED WITHIN THE PORES AS THE SOLVENT EVAPORATES FROM THE MEMBRANE SURFACE. THUS, THE MEMBRANE BARRIER DOES NOT COVER THE ENTIRE SURFACE OF THE SUBSTRATE, YIELDING A MOSAIC SURFACE STRUCTURE WHICH ELIMINATES FLOW RESTRICTIONS RESULTING FROM THE BARRIER THICKNESS.

THESE OBJECTIVES WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH INCORPORATION OF STATE-OFTHE-ART, PROPRIETARY DESIGNS INTO THE PROPOSED DEVICE. SEPRATECH HAS RECENTLY RECEIVED A U.S. PATENT FOR A DESIGN FULFILLING SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME REQUIREMENTS AS DESCRIBED IN SBIR SOLICITATION A90-186 AND REFERENCED IN TECHNICAL REPORT 8814 (AD-A207 411). THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF ANALOGOUS ION EXCHANGE DEVICES, CURRENTLY MANUFACTURED BY SEPRATECH, ELIMINATE THE PROBLEM ASSOCIATED WITH SEPARATORY MATRIX WELLING AND CONTRACTION, I.E. MATRIX COMPACTION AND CHANNEL FORMATION. THESE DEVICES ARE EQUALLY FUNCTIONAL IN ANY ORIENTATION. THE DESIGN ALSO ENABLES ENHANCED SEPARATORY POTENTIAL ABOVE THAT OF TRADITIONAL SEPARATORY COLUMNS WHILE REDUCING THE TIME REQUIRED FOR SEPARATION. THE DEVICES ARE MANUFACTURED FOR CLINICAL USE, THEREFORE, ARE MANUFACTURED ASEPTICALLY AND ARE EASILY STERILIZED BY SEVERAL METHODS.",

VSS IS DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE EXTERNAL BLAST OVERPRESSURE, FROM AN EXPLOSIVE OPERATION, TO A HUMAN TOLERABLE LEVEL. A HUMAN TOLERABLE LEVEL IS DEFINED AS BEING THAT WHICH WILL NOT CAUSE EARDRUM DAMAGE AT A DISTANCE OF 2 METERS. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THIS PROTECTION THE EXTERNAL BLAST OVERPRESSURE MUST BE REDUCED TO 2.3 PSI OR LOWER. SINCE THERE IS DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BLAST OVERPRESSURE AND SOUND LEVEL (DB), REDUCTION OF EXTERN OVERPRESSURE ALSO RESULTS IN SOUND LEVEL REDUCTION. IN PHASE I, VSS ENCLOSURE CONCEPTS AND DESIGNS WILL BE DEVELOPED TO REDUCE THE EXTERNAL SOUND LEVEL BY A 20 DB GOAL, FROM EXPLOSIVE OPERATIONS AND/OR MUNITIONS TESTING. INFORMATION FROM PRIOR TESTED DESIGNS, AND CALCULATIONS FOR SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS WILL BE APPLIED, VSS ENCLOSURES, IN ADDITION TO BLAST OVERPRESSURE REDUCTION, SUPPRESS AND CONTAIN FRAGMENTS AND THERMAL HAZARDS.",

THE USE OF TWO DEVICES, HOWEVER, HAS AN ADVERSE AFFECT ON S&A; SAFETY. G-SWITCHES USED AS RETARD SENSORS IN THE FMU-139 BOMB FUZE ARE CURRENTLY A MAJOR PROBLEM AREA IN THAT PROGRAM. THEIR POOR RELIABILITY IS DUE PRIMARILY TO IMPERFECTIONS IN THE MACHINED SURFACES, CONTAMINATION, AND TOLERANCE STACK-UP WHICH CAUSE HIGH CONTACT RESISTANCE OR LACK OF OPERATION ALTOGETHER. SILICON DESIGNS HAS DEVELOPED A MINIATURE, LOW-COST ACCELEROMETER THAT COMBINES A CAPACITIVE SENSE ELEMENT AND INTEGRATED SENSE ELECTRONICS IN A SINGLE IC PACKAGE. WE HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED AN ACCELERATION THRESHOLD DETECTION CIRCUIT THAT CAN BE INTEGRATED WITH THE SENSE ELECTRONICS. BECAUSE OUR CURRENT ACCELEROMETER'S HYBRID-BASED CONSTRUCTION AND LASER-TRIM CALIBRATION METHOD IS TOO COSTLY FOR USE IN BOMB FUZES, WE PROPOSE TO REDESIGN THE CALIBRATION CIRCUITS SO ALL CIRCUIT FUNCTIONS CAN BE INTEGRATED ONTO A SINGLE CUSTOM IC ALONG WITH THE SENSE ELEMENT. WE HAVE DESCRIBED A BASE-LINE DESIGN FOR SUCH A CHIP IN THIS PROPOSAL. THE RESULTING ELECTRONIC RETARD SENSOR IC WOULD BE VERY RELIABLE DUE TO ITS FABRICATION USING IC TECHNOLOGY.",

A LITERATURE SURVEY WILL BE CONDUCTED TO FOCUS ON PROBLEMS SUCH AS LOCATIONS OF CRITICAL DELAMINATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF THE CANDIDATE COMPONENTS, CONVENIENCE OF FABRICATION OF CRITICAL ROTOR COMPONENTS WITH THERMOPLASTICS, AND BONDING/JOINING THEM WITH THE REST OF THE ROTOR PARTS. THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA BASE WILL BE GENERATED BY TESTING COUPONS. TO SIMULATE MANUFACTURING DEFECTS UPILEX-S(R) DISKS WILL BE EMBEDDED IN THE COUPONS.

THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE FOR PHASE I IS A FEASIBILITY STUDY OF A NOVEL ARITHMETIC UNIT OF THE MICROPROCESSOR. THE APPROACH PROPOSED FOR INCREASING THE SPEED IS AN INNOVATIVE MULTI-PORT GENERAL PURPOSE REGISTER ARRAY AND TWO SEPARATE ADDERS, ONE FOR THE MANTISSA AND ONE FOR THE EXPONENT OF THE FLOATING-POINT OPERATION. FAULT TOLERANCE OF THE REGISTER ARRAY WILL BE ACHIEVED BY AN ERROR DETECTION AND CORRECTION UNIT BASED ON A MODIFIED HAMMING CODE. THE COMBINATIONAL LOGIC OF THE ADDERS EMPLOYS \"FINE-GRAIN\" FAULT TOLERANCE. AN INNOVATIVE DIFFERENTIAL CMOS LOGIC CIRCUIT IS USED TO PERFORM DOUBLE-RAIL LOGIC OPERATIONS FOR EFFICIENT FAULT DETECTION. FAULT CORRECTION IS ACHIEVED BY DUPLICATING THE DOUBLE-RAIL ADDERS. THIS COMBINATION IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN A FAULT-TOLERANT CHIP WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE COST-EFFECTIVE THAN PRESENTLY KNOWN FAULT-TOLERANT APPROACHES.

BEFORE THESE EXPERIMENTS CAN BE CONDUCTED, A LIGHTWEIGHT PROJECTILE CONCEPT MUST BE DEVELOPED WHICH CAN SURVIVE THE 200-1000 KGEE LAUNCH ACCELERATIONS AND OTHER EQUALLY SEVERE LOADS AND BE SUFFICIENTLY LIGHT TO ACHIEVE 10 KM/SEC. THIS PROGRAM WILL EXAMINE ALTERNATIVE PROJECTILE CONCEPTS (E.G., BASE PUSHING OR PULLING, SOLID OR PLASMA ARMATURE, PLASMA BIFURCATION) AND SELECT A BEST APPROACH FOR DETAILED DESIGN, FABRICATION, AND EM GUN TRIALS. THE PHASE I EFFORT WILL DELIVER FOUR RESIN MATRIX CONCEPTS OR 2 METAL MATRIX CONCEPTS. A MATCHED METAL NET MOLDING FABRICATION APPROACH WILL BE USED FOR RMC FABRICATION, THUS ENSURING HIGH QUALITY IN THE PROJECTILE FROM PART TO PART. SPARTA ALSO HAS EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN HOT ISOSTATIC PRESSING BORON ALUMINUM IF METAL MATRIX IS THE SELECTED MATERIAL. THE PROJECTILE DESIGN WILL BE SUPPORTED BY A FULL COMPLEMENT OF ANALYSES AND A COMMITMENT AT SPARTA TO EM GUN TECHNOLOGY.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         WHEN METAL TARGETS ARE IMPACTED BY PROJECTILES, A CRATER PERFORATION OR THROUGH HOLE IS FORMED AND IT IS DESIREABLE TO MEASURE THE DEPTH OF THE ARCH, THE DIAMETER AND VOLUME OF THE CRATER AS A FUNCTION OF DEPTH. GENERALLY, THE LIPS OF THE CRATER WHICH ARE RAGGED, ARE ELEVATED ABOVE THE TARGET FACE AND THERE MAY BE PIECES OF THE FULL OR PARTIALLY BURIED PROJECTILE IN THE CRATER. SPARTA PROPOSES TO DEVELOP AND DEMONSTRATE A NOVEL, RAPID MEANS OF MEASURING CRATER GEOMETRY. THE APPROACH INVOLVES ULTRASONIC MEASUREMENTS IN A QUICK HARDENING \"PLASTIC\" COMPOUND CRATER FILLER. TRAVERSING ULTRASONIC HEAD WILL GENERATE A SONAR MAP OF A SLICE OF THE CRATER AND MULTIPLE SONAR ECHOES WILL DETERMINE THE CROSS SECTION AND LENGTH OF ANY PENETRATOR OR SPALL AS A FUNCTION OF CRATER LOCATION. THE DATA WOULD BE PROCESSED IN A PORTABLE COMPUTER WHICH WOULD DETERMINE CRATER CROSS SECTION AND VOLUME AUTOMATICALLY. THIS SYSTEM IS BASED ON EXPERIENCE BY THE AUTHOR ON THE MEASUREMENT OF CRATERS AND DAMAGE ON METALLIC AND NON METALLIC TARGETS UTILIZING ULTRASONIC GAGES IN CONJUNCTION WITH A QUICK SETTING CRATER FILLING COMPOUND. THE ACCURACY OF CRATER DEPTH MEASUREMENTS WILL BE IN ON THE ORDER OF 0.001 INCHES (0.0254 MM) WITH POSITIONING ACCURACY BEING A FUNCTION OF THE POSITIONING MECHANISM.",

THIS PROJECT WILL RESULT IN AN ANALYSIS TOOL THAT WILL CARRY OUT FLOW SIMULATIONS FOR COMPLEX AND IRREGULAR FIN GEOMETRIES WITH CRUDE AERODYNAMIC SHAPES AND LARGE ATTACK ANGLES. SUCH SIMULATIONS OFTEN INVOLVE PHYSICALLY COMPLEX CONDITIONS OF FLOW SEPARATION, RECIRCULATION AND INTERACTIONS OF SHOCK WAVES. THE SCRAP SCHEME WILL MORE ACCURATELY PREDICT THE RESULTANT FORCES AND MOMENTS ON PRACTICAL FIN GEOMETRIES.

THIS DATA REQUIRES VERY DENSE (AND CONSEQUENTLY EXPENSIVE) SEMICONDUCTOR MEMORY DEVICES TO CONTAIN THE RAW RECORDED DATA. ONE METHOD OF REDUCING THE REQUIREMENT FOR LARGE AMOUNTS OF SEMICONDUCTOR MEMORY IS TO COMPRESS THE DATA BY APPLYING DATA COMPRESSION TECHNIQUES CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. SPECTRUM SCIENCES, INC. PROPOSES TO EVALUATE DIFFERENT COMPRESSION TECHNIQUES FOR SENSOR PARAMETER DATA BY COLLECTING PERFORMANCE DATA DURING ACTUAL EXECUTION OF PROGRAMMED ALGORITHMS. VOICE COMMUNICATION REQUIRES A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO DATA COMPRESSION. LARGE AMOUNTS OF SEMICONDUCTOR MEMORY CAN BE USED UP QUICKLY IF COMPRESSION TECHNIQUES ARE NOT UTILIZED. A NEW FEDERAL STANDARD ALGORITHM FOR LINEAR PREDICTIVE CODING (LPC) HAS RECENTLY BEEN RELEASED.

        "abstract": "Abstract         MOCVD IS A UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED EXPITAXIAL PROCESS FOR THE DEPOSITION OF COMPOUND SEMICONDUCTORS. IN FACT, MANY PRODUCTION FACILITIES ARE IN OPERATION. PRODUCTS INCLUDE MICROWAVE AND MILLIMETER WAVE INTEGRATED CIRCUITS (MMICS), LASER DIODES FOR COMPACT DISC PLAYERS, PHOTOCATHODES FOR NIGHT VISION GOGGLES, AND GALLIUM ARSENIDE AND INDIUM PHOSPHIDE SOLAR CELLS. THE CRITICAL WEAKNESS OF THE MOCVD TECHNIQUE IS ITS DEPENDENCE ON ARSINE GAS AS THE GROUP V REAGENT. THE EXTREME TOXICITY OF THIS SUBSTANCE NECESSITATES COSTLY DETECTION AND SAFETY EQUIPMENT. IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF INCREASING ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS, RESTRICTIONS ALREADY EXIST IN MANY STATES THAT FORBID OR RIGIDLY CONTROL THE AMOUNT OF ARSINE USED IN PRODUCTION. ANY MAJOR RELEASE COULD TRIGGER THE TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT SHUTDOWN OF FACILITIES THAT USE ARSINE AND, THUS, INTERRUPT THE DELIVERY OF DEVICES AND CIRCUITS FOR DEFENSE NEEDS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH ADDRESSES THIS PROBLEM BY SEEKING TO DEVELOP MONOETHYLARSINE AS A REPLACEMENT FOR ARSINE. IT IS A HIGH VAPOR PRESSURE LIQUID SOURCE WHOSE TOXICITY IS EXPECTED TO BE MUCH LOWER THAN THAT OF ARSINE, IS NOT SYNTHESIZED FROM ARSINE, AND IS EXPECTED TO BE PRICED COMPETITIVELY WITH ARSINE ONCE IT IS IN FULL PRODUCTION. THESE AND OTHER REASONS MAKE MONOETHYLARSINE AN EXTREMELY ATTRACTIVE ALTERNATIVE TO ARSINE. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - IF THE QUALITY OF GAAS FILMS GROWN WITH MONOETHYLARSINE IS COMPARABLE TO THOSE GROWN WITH ARSINE, MONOETHYLARSINE COULD COMPLETELY REPLACE ARSINE AS A COST-COMPETITIVE GROUP V SOURCE, OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, FOR THE MOCVD GROWTH OF III-V SEMICONDUCTORS.

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE COBALT-CHROMIUM-MOLYBDENUM ALLOY DESIGNATED STANDARD SPECIFICATION F-75 BY THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR TESTING AND MATERIALS IS THE MOST COMMONLY USED ALLOY IN ORTHOPEDIC PROSTHESES FOR TOTAL AND PARTIAL JOINT REPLACEMENT. THE F-75 ALLOY IS HARD, STABLE, AND CORROSION RESISTANT. ITS WEAR IN JOINT REPLACEMENT PROSTHESES IS NOT A PROBLEM PER SE. HOWEVER, WEAR OF THE MATING ULTRAHIGH-MOLECULAR-WEIGHT POLYETHYLENE (UHMWPE) ON WHICH THE METALLIC PART ARTICULATESIS A WELL-DOCUMENTED CHRONIC PROBLEM. A NUMBER OF RECENT PUBLICATIONS HAVE REPORTED THAT UHMWPE WEAR DEBRIS IS OBSERVED IN THE INTERFACE BETWEEN THE HIP STEM AND FEMOR IN CEMENTED TOTAL HIP REPLACEMENT. THE UHMWPE WEAR DEBRIS IS, THEREFORE, PARTIALLY BLAMED FOR BONE DESORPTION AND EVENTUAL LOOSENING OF THE F-75 ALLOY FEMORAL COMPONENT. ION IMPLANTATION IS AN INNOVATIVE SURFACE MODIFICATION PROCESS THAT CAN READILY BE APPLIED TO FINISHED F-75 ALLOY PROSTHESES. PRELIMINARY RESEARCH AT SPIRE CORPORATION HAS SHOWN THAT ION IMPLANTATION OF BIOLOGICALLY INERT SPECIES SUCH AS NITROGEN AND CARBON INCREASES HARDNESS AND REDUCES THE FRICTION OF THE F-75 ALLOY. THE HARDER, MORE LUBRICIOUSF-75 ALLOY IS EXPECTED TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE WEAR OF THE UHMWPE COMPONENT.",

THE APPROACH IS BASED ON A TECHNIQUE FOR THE NONINVASIVE COUPLING OF INFORMATION INTO A NEW TYPE OF OPTICAL FIBER FROM THE SIDE AT ANY POINT OR, SIMULTANEOUSLY OR IN ANY ARBITRARY SEQUENCE, AT NUMEROUS POINTS ALONG A CONTINUOUS FIBER LENGTH. THE FIBER IS DESIGNED TO AUTOMATICALLY DEMULTIPLEX AND SPATIALLY RESOLVE SAID INFORMATION WITHOUT THE NEED FOR TIME-SHARING PROTOCOLS. THE OBJECTIVE OF PHASE I WORK IS TO FABRICATE THE FIBER AND TEST THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS APPROACH.

SEROLOGICAL ASSAYS HAVE BEEN USED QUITE SUCCESSFULLY TO IDENTIFY PERSONS WITH PRIOR EXPOSURE TO THESE VIRUSES, BUT THEY FAIL TO DETERMINE A CURRENT INFECTION. VIRUS ISOLATION ASSAYS REQUIRE PROLONGED CO-CULTIVATION OF PATIENTS' PBMC WITH A SUSCEPTIBLE CELL LINE AND HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO LACK SENSITIVITY. A NEWLY DESCRIBED DNA AMPLIFICATION TECHNIQUE, THE POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (PCR), APPEARS TO HAVE A GREAT POTENTIAL FOR THE DETECTION OF VIRAL DNA. THE PCR, HOWEVER,REQUIRES HIGHLY TRAINED PERSONNEL, EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT, AND ABOUT 3 DAYS TO PERFORM AN ASSAY. SRA TECHNOLOGIES, INC., PROPOSES TO DEVELOP A SIMPLE, RAPID,HYBRIDIZATION ASSAY TO DETECT CURRENT INFECTIONS BY THESE RETROVIRUSES. THE METHOD EMPLOYS A PLASTIC CAPILLARY AS A SOLID PHASE TO PERFORM THE HYBRIDIZATION ASSAY. THE CAPILLARY PROVIDES A VERY LARGE REACTIVE SURFACE RELATIVE TO SAMPLE SIZE AND ALSO FORCES THE CLOSE PROXIMITY OF REACTANTS. THE ENVIRONMENT PRODUCES INCREASED SENSITIVITY WITH SHORTER INCUBATION TIMES AND TEMPERATURE REQUIREMENTS. A NONISOTOPIC, ENZYME IMMUNOASSAY AMPLIFICATION DETECTION SYSTEM IS USED TO INDICATE HYBRIDIZATION WITH A KNOWN DNA PROBE.",

THE COMPLEXITY OF RF CIRUITRY IS INCREASING THE NECESSARY SKILL LEVEL OF TECHNICANS NEEDED TO DIAGNOSE AND REPAIR HARDWARE FAILURES. NEW AND INNOVATIVE BIT MECHANISMS DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR RF HARDWARE ARE NEEDED TO PROVIDE THE COST EFFECTIVE AND REAL-TIME DETECTION, ISOLATION, AND DIAGNOSIS OF RF CIRCUIT FAILURES. SRS PROPOSES TO DEVELOP END-TO-END BIT TECHNIQUES WHICH WHEN COMBINED PROVIDE NEAR ONE HUNDRED PERCENT FAILURE COVERAGE IN RF CIRCUITS AND EQUIPMENT. SRS'S APPROACH IS BASED ON STIMULATING THE RF CIRCUITS WITH PREFORMATTED TEST PATTERNS WHILE SAMPLING CIRCUIT RESPONSES FROM TEST POINTS AND SENSING INTERFACES TO COMPARE THEM TO STORED SAMPLES OF NOMINAL CIRCUIT RESPONSES.

A LOW-COST PROCESS FOR THESE CONVERSIONS HAS BEEN INVENTED BY DR. VAN DIJK AND MR. FRALEY. ANALYSIS OF APPLICATION OF THIS PROCESS TO THE PROBLEM AS DEFINED IN TOPIC 4, SUBTOPIC D, MERITS FURTHER STUDY, WHICH IS THE DRIVING FORCE FOR THE PRESENT REQUEST. THE PRODUCT YIELD FOR THE PROCESS IS EXPECTED TO BE BETWEEN 65 AND 70%, CARBON ON CARBON. SOME OF THE MODERN METHANOL PROCESSES, STARTING FROM PRESSURIZED METHANE, HAVE HIGHER YIELDS, LIKE OVER 80 % CARBON ON CARBON. SUCH HIGHER YIELDSTHEN CAN COMBINE WITH THE MOBIL PROCESS TO ATTAIN 80 % OVERALL YIELDS TO HYDROCARBONS FOR FUEL USE, AS CLAIMED BY HALDOR-TOPSOE FOR THE TIGAS PROCESS. THESE HIGHER YIELDS, HOWEVER, CAN NOT BE OBTAINED AT ACCEPTABLE CAPITAL COSTS, BECAUSE THE STARTING METHANOL PLANTS CAN NOT BE BUILT AT EXTREMELY LOW CAPITAL COSTS, WHICH IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE PROJECTED USE. NOTWITHSTANDING THE SOMEWHAT LOWER YIELD, THE PRESENT PROCESS PROMISES TO PROVIDE AN ECONOMICALLY ATTRACTIVE CONVERSION FOR METHANE TO FUEL STREAMS. THE STUDY WILL AIM AT FINDING THE PROPER EQUIPMENT, COMBINED WITH OPTIMIZED FLOWSHEET CONDITIONS FOR THAT EQUIPMENT, FOR DIFFERENT STARTING METHANE FLOWS AND ASSUMING DIFFERENT PRESSURES AT SOURCE. THE AIM IS TO OBTAIN AVAILABILITY OF PROPER EQUIPMENT FOR HIGHLY VARIED CONDITIONS (AT LEAST FIVE, POSSIBLY MORE, DIFFERENT CONDITIONS WILL BE STUDIED), SO THAT A SPECTRUM OF SITUATIONS CAN BE ACCOMMODATED WITH THE NEW PROCESS.",

CUTTERS USED FOR THE REMOVAL OF MICROSIZED ABNORMAL TISSUE HAVE DECREASED IN BOTH SIZE AND WEIGHT. THESE REDUCTIONS HAVE IMPROVED THE QUALITY OF MICROSURGERY BY UNLOADING THE PROPRIOCEPTIVE SENSE, THUS INCREASING SENSITIVITY. THESE REDUCTIONS ARE LARGELY DUE TO NEW INNOVATIONS IN THE BLADE DRIVE SYSTEMS AND MATERIALS. PHASE I RESEARCH WILL DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF USING MICRODYNAMIC STRUCTURES (MDS) IN THE DRIVE SYSTEM OF A MICROSURGICAL CUTTING INSTRUMENT. MDS TECHNOLOGY, WHICH INVOLVES THE INTEGRATION OF MECHANICAL AND ELECTRONIC DEVICES ON SILICON SUBSTRATES, IS RELATIVELY NEW. STC TECHNOLOGY GROUP, INC., HAS AN IDEAL APPLICATION FOR MDS IN THE SHEAR CUTTER DRIVE. SEVERAL TYPES OF MICROMOTORS WILL BE ANALYZED, INCLUDING ELECTROSTATIC, RESONANT STRUCTURE, AND PIEZOELECTRIC. DRIVESHAFTS AND GUIDES CONSTRUCTED OF SILICON WILL BE ANALYZED AS TO THEIR WEAR CHARACTERISTICS. CUTTER BLADES CONSTRUCTED OF SILICON WILL ALSO BE ANALYZED AS TO THEIR CAPABILITY TO CUT TISSUE. AFTER FEASIBILITY IS ESTABLISHED, THE ANALYSIS WILL LEAD TO A PHASE II PROJECT THAT WILL INCLUDE THE CONSTRUCTION AND TESTING OF SUCH A DEVICE FOR USE IN COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS.",

FO 4701-89-C-0064, INNOVATIVE CONCEPTS FOR FORCE SUPPORT FROM SPACE - HIGH INTENSITY CONFLICT IN NATO EUROPE, PERFORMED DURING THE PERIOD 89 JUL 27 TO 90 JAN 08. THE INNOVATIONS TO BE DEVELOPED UNDER THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDE: 1) THE USE OF SPACE SYSTEMS IN LOW-INTENSITY CONFLICT; 2) AN ADAPTATION OF THE CONCEPT OF SATELLITE READOUT OF GROUND-BASED SENSORS; AND 3) THE DESCRIPTION OF A C3/I SYSTEM BASED ON SPACE SYSTEMS. ONE OF THE CONFLICT SITUATIONS FOR WHICH THE USE OF SPACE HAS NOT BEEN EXPLORED IS THAT OF LOWINTENSITY CONFLICTS. SUCH CONFLICTS OCCUR AROUND THE GLOBE AND PLACE NEW REQUIREMENTS ON U.S. FORCES. THE CONGRESS LEGISLATED THAT A COMMAND (SPECIAL FORCES COMMAND) BE RESPONSIBLE FOR U.S. FORCES INVOLVED IN THESE CONFLICTS. THE TYPES OF CONFLICTS EXTEND FROM COUNTERINSURGENCY, TO SMALL WAR, REVOLUTIONS AND DRUG WARS. THE ARRAY OF SATELLITES WHICH CAN SUPPORT U.S. AND ALLIED FORCES RANGE FROM NAVIGATION, WEATHER, SIGINT, AND COMMUNICATIONS. PHASE I WILL DEFINE A SYSTEM COMPOSED OF GROUND-BASED SENSORS (ACOUSTIC, SEISMIC, MAGNETIC) AND SPACE-BASED RELAYS, TOGETHER WITH A DEDICATED C3/I SYSTEM. THE PROPOSAL ILLUSTRATES HOW TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN THE SDI PROGRAM CAN BE APPLIED TO THE MISSION-UNIQUE SPACE SYSTEMS FOR LOW INTENSITY CONFLICT.",

THIS WILL BE BASED ON RECENT THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ADVANCES CONCERNING THE ADIABATIC THERMOELASTIC EFFECT AND ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS ON TWO DEMONSTRATION MATERIALS. A SCREENING MATRIX WILL BE ESTABLISHED TO RATE QTNDE FOR SUITABILITY TO INVESTIGATE PARTICULAR MATERIALS AND COMPONENTS. THE SCHEME WILL ALLOW REALISTIC CONSIDERATION OF ARBITRARY MATERIALS (ISOTROPIC OR ANISOTROPIC), GEOMETRIES (NOTCHES; FLAWS; COMPLES TOPOLOGIES), AND SERVICE CONDITIONS (WITHOUT UPPER LIMIT IN TEMPERATURE). THE BEST SPECIAL TECHNIQUE OF QTNDE WILL BE USED FOR EACH MATERIAL TO ASSESS THE CRITICALITY OF FLAWS IN TERMS OF DAMAGE EVOLUTION RATES AND LIFE: A) EVOLUTION OF RANDOM STRESS RAISERS, B) MODULUS CHANGE, OR, C) DENSITY CHANGE.

IN NOAA'S PRESENT ANTENNA, EACH ARRAY IS MADE UP OF APPROXIMATELY TWENTY-FOUR COCO STRINGS. THE BEAM IS TILTED IN A DIRECTION NORMAL TO THE STRINGS BY SHIFTING THE SIGNAL PHASE BETWEEN STRINGS. THE INNOVATIONS IN THE PROPOSED ANTENNA IS TO TILT THE BEAM IN EACH DIRECTION ALONG THE STRING AS WELL AS IN EACH DIRECTION NORMAL TO THE STRING ORIENTATION.

THIS STUDY WILL INVOLVE EXPOSURE OF FILMS AND POWDER MIXTURES OF KNOWN COMPOSITION TO CONTROLLED OVERPRESSURES OF THALLOUS OXIDE (TL2O) AND OXYGEN VAPOR AT HIGH TEMPERATURE (600 - 950 DEGREES CENTIGRADE) FOLLOWED BY QUENCHING. THE COMPOSITION AND MICROSTRUCTURE OF QUENCHED SAMPLES WILL BE EXAMINED TO IDENTIFY THE EQUILIBRIUM HIGH TEMPERATURE PHASES. IN THIS MANNER THE LIQUIDUS AND SOLIDUS TEMPERATURES, EQUILIBRIUM TL2O AND O2 OVERPRESSURES, AND STABLE PHASES WILL BE DETERMINED IN THOSE REGIONS OF COMPOSITION THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR TBCCO THIN FILM AND CRYSTAL GROWTH. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON PHASE CHANGES WILL BE GAINED BY DIFFERENTIAL THERMAL ANALYSIS (DTA) USING SEALED GOLD AMPOULES TO CONTROL THALLIUM VOLATILITY",

THE MICROFENESTRATED ICL CAN BE INSERTED INTO THE CORNEA USING A SIMPLE SURGICAL PROCEDURE. INITIAL INDICATIONS FOR USE INCLUDE HIGH MYOPIA AND APHAKIA. THE MICROFENESTRATIONS, MEASURING APPROXIMATELY 10 MICRONS IN DIAMETER, ARE THE INNOVATIVE FEATURE OF THE LENS DESIGN. THESE PORES ALLOW THE DIFFUSION OF METABOLITES, PARTICULARLYGLUCOSE, ACROSS THE LENS TO THE CORNEAL EPITHELIUM. THEY ALSO REDUCE THE RESOLUTION EFFICIENCY OF THE LENS (RELATIVE TO ICIS OF SOLID ACRYLIC). THE GOALS OF PHASE I RESEARCH ARE TWOFOLD: (1) TO EMPLOY SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY TO DESCRIBE MORE ACCURATELY THEPORE SIZE AND PERCENT COVERAGE OF THE SURFACE BY PORES, AND TO EXAMINE SURFACE AND EDGE CHARACTERISTICS WITH GREAT RESOLUTION; AND (2) TO DESCRIBE HOW RESOLUTION EFFICIENCY IS AFFECTED BY INCREASING THE DENSITY OF MICROFENESTRATIONS FROM 5-PERCENT SURFACE COVERAGE TO 20-PERCENT COVERAGE (IN 5-PERCENT INCREMENTS).

THIS WOULD INVOLVE CREATING TEXT STORAGE SOFTWARE WHICH ALLOWS THE USER TO QUICKLY SELECT TEXT PASSAGES AND ASSOCIATE KEYWORDS WITH THESE PASSAGES. TEXT RETRIEVAL WILL ENCOMPASS ALLOWING INSTANT ACCESS BASED ON TITLE, KEYWORDS, AND SUBJECT CROSS REFERENCING. THE PHASE I EFFORT WILL DISCOVER THE POTIMAL FASHION WITH WHICH THESE TECHNOLOGIES CAN BE SYNERGISTICALLY COMBINED TO CONSTRUCT A \"PERSONAL LIBRARY\" - CUSTOM TAILORED TO THE VISUALLY-DISABLED'S NEEDS.

ONE OF THE MOST STRAIGHTFORWARD APPROACHES TO THE PROBLEM OF LINEAR MOTION AT CRYOGENIC TEMPERATURES USES A ROTATING STEPPER MOTOR AND LEADSCREW ARRANGEMENT TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED RESOLUTION AND ACCURACY. TO DATE, THESE EFFORTS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO PRODUCE HIGH-ACCURACY OVER A REASONABLE LIFETIME, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE BEARING DESIGNS. TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS SOLICITATION TOPIC, THESE BEARINGS MUST BE UNLUBRICATED, LOW WEAR, AND PRODUCE VERY FEW PARTICLES SO THAT A HIGH-VACUUM IS MAINTAINED. A BEARING DESIGN HAS ALREADY BEEN DEVELOPED AND TESTED WHICH SHOWS MUCH PROMISE FOR THE PRESENT APPLICATION. FURTHERMORE, CRYOGENIC STEPPER MOTORS WITH BOTH NORMAL AND SUPERCONDUCTING WINDINGS HAVE BEEN TESTED IN OUR LABORATORY TO TEMPERATURES OF 2.0K WITH SUCCESS. WE PROPOSE AN EFFORT TO DESIGN, FABRICATE A MODEL, AND TEST A CRYOGENIC STEPPER MOTOR/LEADSCREW ASSEMBLY WHICH MEETS OR EXCEEDS THE REQUIREMENTS FOR SPEED, ACCURACY, REPEATABILITY, AND RESOLUTION. ADDITIONALLY, LOW-POWER DESIGNS WILL BE INVESTIGATED TO CONSERVE CRYOGENS IN APPLICATIONS WHERE COOLING IS LIMITED.

BY DEVELOPING A SYSTEM THAT CAN EXTRACT THESE VISUAL FEATURES, SCT BELIEVES THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO PERFORM TORPEDO DETECTION WITH GREATER RELIABILITY AND ACCURACY. THE BASIS OF NEURAL NETS FOR TORPEDO DETECTIONN (NN-TD) IS TO EXTRACT THE RIGHT FEATURES FROM THE ACOUSTIC DATA AND APPLY THE PROPER LOGICAL COMBINATIONS ON THOSE FEATURES TO PERFORM ACCURATE SIGNATURE INTERPRETATION. THE STEPS NECESSARY ARE TO REVIEW AND SELECT A NEURAL NETWORK DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT, DEFINE TORPEDO SIGNATURE CHARACTERISTICS, SPECIFY THE FEATURES OF SPECTRAL DATA WHICH WILL BE USED TO SUPPORT TORPEDO DETECTION, DEVELOP A NEURAL NETWORK TO IDENTIFY AND QUANTIFY THESE FEATURES, AND DEMONSTRATE THE CAPABILITY TO PRIVIDE A CLEAR CUT DECISION ABOUT THE PRESENCE OF A TORPEDO IN PASSIVE ACOUSTIC DATA.",

RESEARCH HAS CHARACTERIZED AB19-4 TO BE A PARATOPE-SPECIFIC ANTI-ID MAB THAT MIMICS THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE OF NEUTRALIZING EPITOPES OF THE VIRUS. FURTHERMORE, POLYCLONAL RESPONSES OBTAINED FROM RABBITS IMMUNIZED WITH AB19-4 SHOWED SPECIFIC IMMUNOREACTIVITY TO GP120 AND NEUTRALIZING ACTIVITY TOWARD HIV-1. AB19-4 IS, THEREFORE, A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR AIDS VACCINE DEVELOPMENT.

THE ADAPTATION OF THIS TECHNOLOGY TO WHEELED AND TRACKED MILITARY VEHICLES WILL PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN BOTH HANDLING AND RIDE. A SECOND BENEFIT OF THIS TYPE OF SUSPENSION IS THAT IT CAN EASILY ACCEPT EXTERNAL SENSOR INPUT, TO ALLOW ADAPTIVE RESPONSE CAPABILITY. THIS MEANS THAT SUSPENSION CHARACTERISTICS CAN BE READILY ALTERED TO ACCOMMODATE CHANGES IN VEHICLE GROSS WEIGHT, ROAD CONDITIONS, AND MISSION PROFILES. A THIRD BENEFIT IS THE RELATIVE SIMPLICITY OF THE COMPRESSIBLE FLUID SUSPENSION, AS COMPARED TO BOTH PNEUMATIC AND MECHANICAL DESIGNS HAVING ADAPTIVE CAPABILITY. A SIMPLE COMPRESSIBLE FLUID STRUT PROVIDES MAXIMUM CAPABILITY WITH A MINIMUM NUMBER OF PARTS. THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THE DESIGN OF A COMPRESSIBLE FLUID SUSPENSION HAVING ADAPTIVE SPRING AND DAMPING CHARACTERISTICS. THE CANDIDATE VEHICLE IS THE USMC LAV-25, WITHIN WHICH AN ADEQUATE ENVELOPE EXISTS TO APPLY THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY.",

THE PRESSURE DROP DOES NOT INCREASE WITH TIME BECAUSE THERE IS NO BUILDUP OF PARTICULATE ON A FILTER MEDIA; THE CONTAMINATION IS CARRIED FROM THE FILTRATION SITE BY THE LIQUID. S.R. TAYLOR AND ASSOCIATES HAS BEEN DEVELOPING A NOVEL ULTRASONIC ATOMIZER THAT OFFERS SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES OVER TRADITIONAL TWO FLUID ATOMIZERS.

NO OUTSIDE SOURCE OF ENERGY OTHER THAN ELECTRICAL ENERGY TO DRIVE THE ULTRASONIC TRANSDUCER IS REQUIRED. SRTA, ALONG WITH ITS SUBCONTRACTOR SOUTHWEST RESEARCH INSTITUTE, PROPOSES TO USE ITS EXPERIENCE WITH ULTRASONICS AND AIR FILTRATION TO DEVELOP AN ULTRASONIC ATOMIZER, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE OPERATING CONDITIONS FOR SUCCESSFUL ATOMIZATION, TO USE THESE ATOMIZERS TO FILTER DUST AND VAPOR CONTAMINANTS FROM A GAS STREAM.

TRAWL AND LONG-LINE FISHING GEARS REPRESENT A SIZABLE INVESTMENT BY THE FISHERMEN AND A RESPECTABLE PERCENTAGE OF THE REVENUE WHEN COMPARED TO THE YEARLY INCOME OF AN AVERAGE COMMERCIAL FISHERMAN. LONG-LINE GEARS (CONTAINING FEEDER LINES, DROP LINES, FLOATS, RADIO BEACONS, ETC.) COST AN AVERAGE OF $10K - $15K PER YEAR. THOUGH A COMMERCIAL FISHERMAN CAN IDENTIFY THE LOCATION WHERE THE GEAR WAS INITIALLY LOST, IT CAN TAKE HIM UP TO SIX DAYS TO LOCATE THELOST GEAR, BECAUSE THE GENERAL AREA TO BE SEARCHED IS ABOUT 100 MILES. THE IMPACT OF THE LOST FISHING GEAR IS NOT LIMITED TO THE COST OF TIME AND THE COST OF FISHING OPPORTUNITIES TO THE COMMERCIAL FISHERMAN, BUT IT CAN ALSO REPRESENT DANGER TO OTHER VESSELS, MARINE MAMMALS, AND ENDANGERED SPECIES.",

THE MAJORITY OF THEIR MILITARY APPLICATIONS REQUIRE A COMPLEX SHAPED FINAL FORM THAT IS GENERALLY OBTAINED BY MACHINING WHICH IS COSTLY AND RESULTS IN THE LOSS OF EXPENSIVE MATERIAL. METAL INJECTION MOLDING (MIM) IS A PROCESS IDEALLY SUITED FOR PRODUCING COMPLEX SHAPES. IT WOULD BE OF GREAT ADVANTAGE IF MIM CAN BE USED TO SUCCESSFULLY RETAIN THE UNIQUE PROPERTY COMBINATION OF TUNGSTEN HEAVY ALLOYS, WHICH ARE EXTREMELY SENSITIVE TO PROCESSING CONDITIONS, IMPURITIES, AND POST SINTERING TREATMENTS. THE TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY OF MIM AS AN ECONOMIC MANUFACTURING METHOD FOR TUNGSTEN HEAVY ALLOYS INTO NET COMPLEX PARTS WILL BE ANSWERED DURING THIS RESEARCH. PHASE I WILL ADDRESS THE KEY ISSUES OF: POWDER-BINDER MIXING, OPTIMUM SOLID LOADING OF THE BINDER, ALLOY ADDITIVES, INJECTION MOLDING, DEBINDING, PROPER SINTERING AND HEAT TREATMENT SCHEDULE, EVALUATION AND COMPARISON OF THE TENSILE PROPERTIES WITH CLASSIC PRESS/SINTERED ALLOYS, AND MICROSTRUCTURAL ANALYSIS.",

THE CONCEPT DIFFERS FROM LASER- INDUCED FLUORESCENCE (LIF) IN THE USE OF A LOW-COST PUMP SOURCE AND THE EXAMINATION OF BROAD SPECTRAL REGIONS. PHASEI RESEARCH USES EXISTING SPECTRAL MODELS TO EXPLORE DESIGN CONCEPTS, TO PERFORM SIMPLE LAB EXPERIMENTS USING AVAILABLE EQUIPMENT TO VALIDATE MODELS, AND TO DEVELOP A PRELIMINARY CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF A PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENT. PHASE II EFFORTS WOULD CONSIST OF DETAILED DESIGN, FABRICATION, AND TESTING OF THE PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENT. DUE TO THE PHYSICAL MECHANISM INVOLVED, IT IS EXPECTED TO BE APPLICABLE FOR PRESSURES RANGING FROM 0.1 ATM TO 10 ATM AND TEMPERATURES FROM 200K TO 1500K.

TELECOMMUNICATION DEVICES FOR THE DEAF (TDD) ALLOWS ACCESS TO THE PUBLIC TELEPHONE NETWORK FOR MANY WHO WOULD OTHERWISEHAVE NO ACCESS. HOWEVER, IT HAS SIGNIFICANT LIMITATIONS: TDD ACCESS AND DOMAIN OF SERVICE ARE LIMITED BY THE SCARCITYOF TDD TERMINALS AND SERVICE CAPABILITY IS LIMITED TO TYPEWRITTEN MESSAGES. THE TELEGRAPHICS DEVICE (TGD), WHICH WAS CONCEIVED TO ADDRESS TDD'S LIMITATIONS, IS A SMALL GRAPHICS TERMINAL TO BE USED WITH ANY TELEPHONE ON A STANDARD LINE, ALLOWING CONCURRENT VOICE AND TEXT/GRAPHICS INTERACTION. THE CRUX OF TGD DEVELOPMENT IS TO HAVE ACCEPTABLE VOICE (QUALITY) AND GRAPHIC (RATE) COMMUNICATION WITHIN THE LIMITED VOICE BANDWIDTH OF THE PUBLIC TELEPHONE NETWORK IN AWAY THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE A TGD ON BOTH ENDS FOR NORMAL TELEPHONE USE. THAT IS, TELEPHONES WITH TGD MUST BE BACKWARD-COMPATIBLE TO TELEPHONES WITHOUT TGD. FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN INDICATED BY INITIAL CALCULATIONS AND TESTING, AND MOST OF THE HARDWARE FOR A TARGET IMPLEMENTATION HAS BEEN SELECTED. THE FIRST PHASE IN THIS PROJECT REQUIRES TWO UNITS TO DEMONSTRATE FEASIBILITY AND TEST DIRECTIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION. INITIAL PROBLEMS TO BE ADDRESSED FOR THESE PROTOTYPE UNITS ARE TO REFINE THE VOICE/DATA MULTIPLEXING SCHEME, TO DEVELOP THE WRITE-ON DISPLAY SCREEN, AND TO COUPLE THIS USER INTERFACE WITH THE VOICE/DATA MULTIPLEXER.",

PLATELETS, CELLS THAT AGGREGATE IN RESPONSE TO ARTERIAL INJURY, ARE THE MAJOR CELLULAR COMPONENTS FOUND IN SUCH THROMBI. THROMBOLYTIC THERAPIES, WHICH DO NOT AFFECT PLATELETS, ARE EFFECTIVE IN REMOVING CLOTS BUT DO NOT PREVENT PLATELET-DEPENDENT REOCCLUSION AND CAN CAUSE HEMORRHAGE, WHICH REQUIRES PLATELET ADHESION. PLATELET AGGREGATION IS MEDIATED BY CELL SURFACE GLYCOPROTEIN (GP) IIB/IIIA COMPLEX, WHICH RECOGNIZES THE ARG-GLY-ASP (RGD) SEQUENCE FOUND IN PLASMA ADHESIVE PROTEINS SUCH AS FIBRINOGEN AND VON WILLEBRAND FACTOR. RGD-CONTAINING PEPTIDE ANALOGS WILL BE SCREENED FOR THEIR SUPERIOR INHIBITORY EFFECTS AGAINST PLATELET AGGREGATION AS WELL AS FOR INCREASED SPECIFICITY FOR THE GP IIB/IIIA RECEPTOR. ALSO, THE RGD-DEPENDENT INTERACTIONS OF GP IIB/IIIA WITH MAJOR ADHESIVE PROTEINS WILL BE ASSESSED VIA THE ATTACHMENT OF LIPOSOMES CONTAINING THE PURIFIED RECEPTOR. PEPTIDES EXHIBITING HIGH ANTAGONISTIC POTENCIES AGAINST THESE RESPONSES WILL ALSO BE TESTED FOR THEIR UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS ON THE RELEASE OF VASOCONSTRICTORY AND CHEMOTACTIC SUBSTANCES FROM PLATELETS AND ON ENDOTHELIAL CELL ACTIVATIONAND DETACHMENT. FINALLY, THE ANTITHROMBOTIC EFFICACIES OF CANDIDATE PEPTIDES WILL BE DETERMINED IN SEVERAL ANIMAL MODELS OF THROMBOSIS. IT IS HOPED THAT THIS RESEARCH WILL LEAD TO A PRODUCT WITH ACTIONS SYNERGISTIC TO THOSE OF CONVENTIONAL THROMBOLYTIC THERAPIES.",

THIS PROGRAM IS TO DEVELOP A NEW HIGH POWER ACOUSTIC SOURCE THAT WILL OPERATE EFFICIENTLY IN SALT WATER AND AT DIFFERENT PULSE LENGTHS TO NEUTRALIZE VARIOUS UNDERWATER DEVICES. THIS SBIR PROPOSED PROGRAM TAKES ADVANTAGE OF SEVERAL RECENT TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENTS IN PULSED POWER AND WATER DISCHARGES. THE SYSTEM INCLUDES THE GENERATION OF HIGH ENERGY SPARKS IN SEA WATER, USING A NEW PROPRIETARY TECHNIQUE INVENTED BY TETRA CORPORATION. THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY WILL ENHANCE SUBSTANTIALLY THE NAVY'S CAPABILITY TO DAMAGE UNDERWATER EQUIPMENT AND WILL ALSO PROVIDE MEANS FOR CONDUCTING LONG RANGE SONAR MAPPING. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROGRAM IN PHASE I AND PHASE II IS TO DEVELOP HIGH ENERGY PULSED POWER SOURCES FOR PRODUCING SHOCKWAVES SUFFICIENT TO DAMAGE UNDERWATER EQUIPMENT. THE PHASE I OBJECTIVE IS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF THE CONCEPT BY CONDUCING SPECIFIC ACOUSTIC EXPERIMENTS IN SALT WATER USING AN EXISTING PULSE POWER TEST FACILITY.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         THE CONCEPT FOR A BULK OPTICALLY-CONTROLLED SEMICONDUCTOR SWITCH (BOSS), WHERE TWO DIFFERENT WAVELENGTH LASERS ARE USED TO GENERATE AND QUENCH PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY WAS RECENTLY INTRODUCED BY SCHOENBACH AND LAKDAWALA AT OLD DOMINION UNIVERSITY (ODU). INSTEAD OF SUSTAINING PHOTOCONDUCTANCE BYLASER LIGHT, AS IN CONVENTIONAL PHOTOCONDUCTIVE SWITCHES, ONE LASER IS USED TO DRIVE THE SWITCH INTO A CONDUCTIVE STATE WHERE IT REMAINS AND ANOTHER TO QUENCH THE PHOTOCONDUCTANCE ON DEMAND. THIS PROPOSAL IS TO TRANSFER THE TECHNOLOGY FROM ODU TO TETRA CORPORATION AND DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY AS A FAST OPENING BREAKING SWITCH FOR HUNDREDS OF KILOAMPS AND TENS OF KILOVOLTS. THE ISSUE OF THE SWITCH CLOSING AND OPENING HAS BEEN ADDRESSED AT ODU WITH ONE SAMPLE. HOWEVER, THE ISSUE OF FEASIBILITY FOR HIGHCURRENT AND HIGH VOLTAGE APPLICATIONS HAS NOT BEEN ADDRESSED. THE OBJECTIVE OF PHASE I IS TO DETERMINE BOSS SWITCH FEASIBILITY AS A HIGH POWER, HIGH VOLTAGE OPENING SWITCH. SPECIFICALLY, THE OBJECTIVE IS TO 1) FABRICATE A LARGER SAMPLE TO DETERMINE SCALE-UP FEASIBILITY AND REPEATABILITY; 2) CHARACTERIZE THE SAMPLE AND, 3) TEST THE SAMPLE TO DETERMINE POTENTIAL AS A HIGH VOLTAGE PULSED POWEROPENING SWITCH. THESE OBJECTIVES WILL DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND LAY THE GROUND WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT OF THE TECHNOLOGY IN PHASE II.",

THEIR RESPONSES DURING USE OF A LEARNING AID DESIGNED BY THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR FOR LEARNING DISABLED CHILDREN WILL BE COLLECTED, AND ANALYZED. THE RESULTS WILL BE USED TO RELATE INDIVIDUAL RESPONSES TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE LEARNING AID FOR THAT CHILD AND TO DEVELOP ALTERNATE METHODS OF PRESENTATION. THE FINAL PRODUCT WILL BE A WORKING ADAPTIVE LEARNING AID WHICH ASSISTS IN TEACHING LEARNING DISABLED CHILDREN THE ALPHABET. IT WILL DEMONSTRATE THAT THE RESPONSE OF AN INDIVIDUAL IS RELATED TO LEARNING AID EFFECTIVENESS AND THATTHIS RELATIONSHIP CAN BE USED TO RELATE INDIVIDUAL RESPONSESTO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE LEARNING AID FOR THAT CHILD AND TO DEVELOP ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF PRESENTATION.

THE RESULT OF THE PHASE I PROJECT WILL BE A SINGLE SOFTWARE PROGRAM DESIGNED FOR DISABLED AND SPECIAL NEEDS CHILDREN ANDEQUIPPED WITH THE \"ADAPTIVE LEARNING AID\". THIS PROGRAM WILL SERVE AS THE PROTOTYPE FOR FURTHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF \"SPECIAL NEEDS\" SOFTWARE. THE RESULT OF THE PHASE II PROJECT WILL BE A RESEARCH TOOL WHICH COLLECTS DATA UNOBTRUSIVELY FROM CHILDREN WITH EXTENSIVELY VARIED BACKGROUNDS AND NEEDS. THIS DATA COLLECTION WILL SUPPORT THE CREATION OF SIMULATIONS BASED UPON THE EMPIRICAL DATA COLLECTED. AS A RESULT, WE WILL BE ABLE TO MODIFY PROGRAMS AND BETTER UNDERSTAND DIFFERENCES INTHE PROCESS OF LEARNING BETWEEN A MULTITUDE OF SPECIAL NEEDSCHILDREN. CONSEQUENTLY, WE MAY IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LEARNING FOR THIS POPULATION OF CHILDREN BY WORKING TOWARD DEVELOPMENT OF COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE EDUCATIONAL SOFTWARE DESIGNED TO MEET THE DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS OF SUCH CHILDREN.

HEAT PIPES CAN COOL THESE SURFACES EITHER ACTIVELY OR PASSIVELY. COOLING THE LEADING EDGE ACTIVELY REQUIRES AN AUXILIARY HYDROGEN COOLED HEAT EXCHANGER COUPLED TO THE HEAT PIPE CONDENSER. THIS METHOD ADD WEIGHT AND COMPLEXITY TO THE DESIGN. PASSIVELY COOLING THE LEADING EDGE REQUIRES A MATERIAL WITH A HIGH SERVICE TEMPERATURE BECAUSE, AT STEADY STATE, THE HEAT INPUT MUST EQUAL THE RADIATED HEAT LOAD. CARBON-CARBON IS SUCH A MATERIAL. ALTHOUGH CARBON-CARBON HAS EXCELLENT MECHANICAL PROPERTIES AT HIGH TEMPERATURE SUCH AS HIGH SERVICE TEMPERATURE, HIGH STRENGTH AND MODULUS OF ELASTICITY AND LOW DENSITY, IT DOES HAVE SHORTCOMINGS WITH RESPECT TO HEAT PIPES. CARBON-CARBON IS POROUS AND HAS A VERY LOW COEFFICIENT OF THERMAL EXPANSION. THIS PHASE I PROGRAM OUTLINES A WORK EFFORT TO EVALUATE POSSIBLESEALING TECHNIQUES/MATERIALS TO THE CARBON-CARBON SUBSTRATE. THESE SEALING MATERIALS AND METHODS WILL BE APPLIED TO TEST COUPONS AND TESTED ACCORDING TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS FOR HYPERSONIC VEHICLES. THE END RESULT OF THE WORK EFFORT WILL BE A VACUUM TIGHT CARBON-CARBON HEAT PIPE ENVELOPE TO BE USED FOR WING LEADING EDGES.",

THERMAL MANAGEMENT OF THE BATTERY CELLS IS REQUIRED DURING CHARGING AND DISCHARGING. PROPER THERMAL MANAGEMENT WILL ISOTHERMALIZE THE BATTERY CELLS BY PROVIDING THERMAL INSULATION DURING RECHARGE OR SUNLIGHT OPERATION AND PROVIDING A MEANS TO RADIATE EXCESS HEAT GENERATED DURING DISCHARGE OR ECLIPSE OPERATION. VARIABLE CONDUCTANCE HEAT PIPES (VCHP) WILL PROVIDE PASSIVE LIGHTWEIGHT TEMPERATURE CONTROL FOR THE SODIUM-SULFIDE CELLS FOR GEOSYNCHRONOUS-EARTH-ORBIT (GEO) AND LOW-EARTH-ORBIT (LEO). THE GOAL OF THIS PHASE I PROGRAM IS TO ESTABLISH INTERCHANGEABLE THERMAL MANAGEMENT DESIGNS USING VCHPS FOR A COMMON SODIUM-SULFUR BATTERY CELL CONFIGURATION. ONLY ONE BATTERY CELL CONFIGURATION IS REQUIRED AND CAN BE USED FOR GEO OF LEO APPLICATIONS. THE VCHP COOLING SCHEME WOULD SIMPLY MEET THE THERMAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE ORBIT MISSION AND AVOID THE NEED TO CONFIGURE THE BATTERY CELLS TO MEET THE THERMAL MANAGEMENT DESIGN FOR DIFFERENT ORBITS. THIS PHASE I EFFORT WILL FABRICATE AND TEST A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT VCHP TO DEMONSTRATE THERMAL MANAGEMENT FOR SODIUM-SULFUR BATTERY TO BE USED IN LEO.",

        "abstract": "Abstract         THIS COUNTRY IS FACING AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT PROBLEM IN PROVIDING ELECTRIC ENERGY IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FOR THE NEAR FUTURE. THIS PROBLEM IS COMPOUNDED, ON THE ONE HAND, BY THE VERY HIGH COST OF NUCLEAR POWER, THE EXTREMELY LONG APPROVAL AND CONSTRUCTION TIMES, AND THE SHUTTING DOWN OF SEVERAL PLANTS EVEN BEFORE START UP BECAUSE OF THE CONCERNS OF LOCAL CITIZENS. ON THE OTHER HAND, CONVENTIONAL POWER PLANT INSTALLATIONS FOR NEW BASE LOAD GENERATION, WHICH COSTONE BILLION DOLLARS AND UP, EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM OF POLLUTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE DEPLETION OF SCARCE NATURAL RESOURCES. IT IS NOT SURPRISING, THEREFOR, THAT STATE POWER COMMISSIONS HAVE TURNED MORE AND MORE TO DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT ALTERNATIVES IN THE FORM OF INEXPENSIVE, OFF-PEAK ELECTRIC THERMAL STORAGE TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. UNFORTUNATELY, ONE OF THE MAJOR IMPEDIMENTS TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE PROGRAMS IS THE LACK OF AN OFF-PEAK ELECTRIC STORAGE APPLIANCE WHICH CAN OVERCOME THE SERIOUS PROBLEMS OF THOSE DEVICES ON THE MARKET TODAY. ALL OF THE PRESENT ELECTRIC STORAGE APPLIANCES ARE BASED ON THE STORAGEOF \"SENSIBLE\" THERMAL ENERGY IN HIGH DENSITY BRICKS. THESE BRICKS, WHICH WEIGH 172 POUNDS FOR A STORAGE CAPACITY OF 40,000 BTU, ARE HEATED TO ABOUT 1400 DEGREES FARENHEIT, WHICH RESULTS IN SEVERAL UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS: THEY OVERHEAT THE ROOM AND THEY ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO THERMALLY CONTROL; THEY SCORCH THE RUGS THEY STAND ON AS WELL AS THE WALLS BEHIND THEM; AND THEY ARE INEFFICIENT IN THEIR USE OF ELECTRICITY DURING CHARGE-UP. CONSEQUENTLY, IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE USE OF OFF-PEAK ELECTRIC THERMAL STORAGE APPLIANCES, THEY NEED TO BE MADE MORE ATTRACTIVE TO POTENTIAL USERS BY THE OVERCOMING OF THESE PROBLEMS. OUR PROPOSAL OVERCOMES ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS BY USING AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH WHICH ALLOWS MORE ENERGY TO BE STORED, AT A LOWER TEMPERATURE, IN A SMALLER VOLUME THAN THE SAME MASS OF BRICKS CAN. OUR PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDES THE IDEA FOR A VERY EFFECTIVE INSULATION SYSTEM WHICH WILL PROVIDE FOR A TEMPERATURE DROP BETWEEN THE CORE OF THE STORAGE CONTAINER AND THE OUTER SURFACE OF THE APPLIANCE OF ABOUT 650 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT IN 1/4\", THEREBY MAINTAINING THE LATTER SURFACE NEAR AMBIENT. WITH THESE MAJOR PRODUCT IMPROVEMENTS WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR COMPANY WILL CAPTURE A SIGNIFICANT FRACTION OF THE WORLD WIDE ELECTRIC STORAGE MARKET, WHICH IN ENGLAND ALONE, AMOUNTS TO ANNUAL SALES OF OVER ONE MILLION UNITS.",

THE LEARNING PROCESS FOR THE DEAF TYPICALLY REQUIRES A HIGH LEVEL OF REPETITION AND RESTATEMENT TO ACCOMPLISH AND VERIFY MEANINGFUL COMMUNICATION. IN MOST SUBJECT AREAS, LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATION LIMITATIONS CONTROL THE PACE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF EDUCATING THE DEAF. IN MATHEMATICS, HOWEVER, WHERE THE SUBJECT ITSELF IS A LANGUAGE, AND TO THE EXTENT MATHEMATICS CAN BE DIRECTLY AND SIMULTANEOUSLY EXPERIENCED BY STUDENT AND TEACHER, LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATION RELATED LIMITATIONS OF TRADITIONAL APPROACHES TO THE TEACHING OF MATHEMATICS TO THE DEAF CAN BELARGELY OVERCOME. MATHMATICS AND ITS RELATED FIELDS OF TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE REPRESENT A FIELD OF OPPORTUNITY WHERE THE DEAF ARE POTENTIALLY LEAST HANDICAPPED. THE PHASEI PROPOSAL INVESTIGATES THE EXTENT TO WHICH A MANIPULATIVE AND EXPERIENCE-BASE APPROACH IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN EXISTINGMETHODS FOR THE TEACHING OF MATHEMATICS TO KINDERGARTEN, FIRST, AND SECOND GRADE DEAF CHILDREN. PHASE II WILL ALLOW FURTHER REFINEMENT OF THE MODEL DEVELOPED AND EXPANSION TO ACOMPREHENSIVE IMPROVED CURRICULUM PACKAGE FOR MATH INSTRUCTION IN ELEMENTARY GRADES K - 6. ANTICIPATED RESULTS OF PHASE I & II INCLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN IMPROVED CURRICULUM AND APPROACH SO THAT MATHEMATICS CAN BE TAUGHT MUCH MORE SUCCESSFULLY TO DEAF STUDENTS IN GRADES K-6, AND THAT THE DEAF WILL THEREFORE BE ABLE TO MOREFULLY SHARE IN THE SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES IN MATH AND TECHNOLOGY BASED FIELDS. THERE IS A REALISTIC COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITY FOR THE IMPROVED CURRICULUM TO BE ADOPTED NATION-WIDE AS WELL AS MARKET POTENTIAL TO PARENTS.",

UNFORTUNATELY, CURRENT DESIGNS REQUIRE THAT THE PYROLYTIC CARBON COMPONENTSBE DEFORMED (STRESSED) AND HANDLED EXCESSIVELY IN ORDER TO COMPLETE VALVE ASSEMBLY. THESE MANIPULATIONS MAY CAUSE DEFECTS THAT CAN RESULT IN THROMBOSIS OR PREMATURE MECHANICAL FAILURE OF THE VALVE. NEWER DESIGNS ARE ATTEMPTING TO CIRCUMVENT THIS PROBLEM BY ADDING A STIFFENING RING TO THE VALVES. THE ADDITION OF A STIFFENING RING SIMPLIFIES THE ASSEMBLY PROCESS AND MINIMIZES HANDLING. THE ADVANTAGES INHERENT IN USING A STIFFENING RING CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ATTACHMENT MECHANISM IS PROPERLY DESIGNED. TINI ALLOY COMPANY PLANS TO DEVELOP AN INNOVATIVE MECHANISM FOR THE ATTACHMENT OF A STIFFENING RING TO A MECHANICAL HEART VALVE PROTHESIS USING AN INTERMEDIATE LOCKING RING MADE FROM NICKEL-TITANIUM SHAPE-MEMORY ALLOY. THE PURPOSE OF THE NOVEL DESIGN IS TO PERMIT A SLIP-FIT ASSEMBLY OF A STIFFENING RING AROUND A HEART VALVE HOUSING. THE LOCKING RING'S SHAPE-MEMORY PROPERTIES WILL SECURE THE STIFFENING RING TO THE VALVE HOUSING WHILE MINIMIZING VALVE HANDLING AND STRESS. THIS DEVELOPMENT WILL IMPROVE HEART VALVE QUALITY AND RELIABILITY.",

TWO SIGNIFICANT INNOVATIVE DESIGN FEATURES ARE PROPOSED TO EXTEND THE CURRENT STATE OF THE ART. FIRST IS A NEW SOURCE DESIGN TO ACHIEVE THE SPECIFIED WAVELENGTH COVERAGE. CONVENTIONAL DESIGNS USE BLACKBODY SOURCES AND BANDPASS FILTERS WITH LIMITED RESOLUTION CHOICES AND SOURCE POWER. AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH USING A MONOCHROMATOR HAS VARIABLE WAVELENGTH RESOLUTION BUT IS ALSO LIMITED IN POWER OUTPUT. THE MOST INNOVATIVE SOURCE DESIGN USES THE FTIR (FOURIER TRANSFORM INFRARED) SPECTROMETER. IT SHOULD RESULT IN HIGHER PERFORMANCE INSTRUMENTATION BECAUSE OF THROUGHPUT AND EFFICIENCY ADVANTAGES. THE SECOND INNOVATION PROPOSED HERE IS IN THE MEASUREMENT OF THE FOUR STOKES PARAMETERS.

THIS IS ENCODED BY PART OF A LARGER GENE FOR AMYLOID PRECURSOR PROTEIN (APP), WHICH HAS BEEN CLONED, MAPPED, AND PARTIALLY CHARACTERIZED. RECENT DATA SUGGEST THAT IN AD, BETAAP IS CLEAVED FROM APP AND DEPOSITED IN AMYLOID PLAQUES AS A RESULT OF ABNORMAL PRECURSOR PROCESSING. INCREASING THE APP GENE DOSAGE IN CULTURED CELLS BY TRANSFECTING THE HUMAN APP GENE INDUCES OVERPRODUCTION OF PROTEIN DETERMINANTS INCLUDING BETAAP. ALTHOUGH INCREASED GENE DOSAGE OF APP IS NOT FOUND IN AD, ITMAY BE SUFFICIENT FOR AMYLOID PLAQUE FORMATION. THEREFORE, THE TRANSFER OF HUMAN APP INTO MICE MAY CONFER AN EFFECTIVE INCREASE IN GENE DOSAGE THAT PREDISPOSES THEM TO AMYLOID PLAQUE DEPOSITS. THESE MICE MAY BE USED TO STUDY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN APP EXPRESSION, AMYLOID PROCESSING, AND PLAQUE FORMATION. SUCH MICE WOULD BE A VALUABLE MODEL FOR EXPLORING BOTH PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND POTENTIAL PALLIATIVE TREATMENTS FOR THE HUMAN DISORDER.",

EXTENSIVE EFFORT HAS FOCUSED ON SEARCHING FOR ITS INHIBITORS, BUT THIS HAS BEEN HINDERED BECAUSE HIV IS DANGEROUS TO HANDLE AND EXPENSIVE TO PRODUCE. THIS RESEARCH WILL CONSTRUCT A RECOMBINANT MOLONEY MURINE LEUKEMIA VIRUS CARRYING HIV REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE. THIS NOVEL VIRUS WILL HAVE ALL THE ADVANTAGES OF AN ECOTROPIC MURINE RETROVIRUS, INCLUDING BIOSAFETY, HIGH YIELD, AND LOW COST OF PRODUCTION.

THE RECOMBINANT VIRUS CAN BE CONSTRUCTED BY SPLICING THE DNA ENCODING HIV REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE TO THE MOLONEY LEUKEMIA VIRUS VECTOR.

DESIGNED TO INFORM AND HELP EMPOWER LISTENERS, THE AUDIOTAPES WILL PRESENT FACTS ON THE EFFECTS OF SUBSTANCE ADDICTION AND PERSONAL REFLECTIONS ON LIFE-CHANGING DECISIONS TO RESIST OR LEAVE DRUGS. THE AUDIOTAPES WILL MODEL LEVELS OF SHARING AND SERVE AS A SPRINGBOARD TO SELF-EXAMINATION IN SMALL FACILITATOR- OR PEER-LED DISCUSSION GROUPS. THESE TAPES WILL STIMULATE RECONSIDERATION OF ESSENTIAL ISSUES AND CULTURAL/ETHNIC AND ECONOMIC REALITIES THAT PARTICIPANTS MUST RESOLVE AND COPE WITH TO GAIN CONTROL AND DIRECTION OVER THEIR LIVES IN HIGH-RISK ENVIRONMENTS. FACILITATOR AND PARTICIPANT GUIDEBOOKS WILL ASSIST PARTICIPANTS BY PROVIDING INFORMATION, DISCUSSION TOPICS, EXERCISES, AND ACTIVITIES. THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS APPROACH WILL BE TESTED WITH TARGET AUDIENCES BY EVALUATING ITS CULTURAL SENSITIVITY AND DISCUSSION GROUP DYNAMICS.

COMBATING THIS TENDENCY CAN EXHAUST INDIVIDUALS PROPELLING A WHEELCHAIR ACROSS A SLOPE AS SLIGHT AS TWO DEGREES REQUIRES TWICE THE ENERGY AS A LEVEL SURFACE. MUCH EFFORT HAS BEEN MADE BY GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE GROUPS TO INSURE THAT FACILITIES ARE ACCESSIBLE TO THE PHYSICALLY DISABLED. HOWEVER, WHEELCHAIR USERS STILL MUST EITHER PROPEL THEMSELVES OR BE PUSHED ACROSS SLOPED SIDEWALKS, PARKING LOTS, OR ACCESS RAMPS. EVEN THESE MINOR SLOPES CAN INDUCE THE DOWNHILL TURNING TENDENCY. THE PROPOSED STABILIZING DEVICE WOULD ELIMINATE THIS TENDENCY AND INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE WHEELCHAIR, REDUCE THE FATIGUE OF THE PATIENT OR ATTENDANT, CREATE A SAFER, MORE EASILY CONTROLLED WHEELCHAIR, AND INSTANTLY \"REMOVE\" A COMMON ENVIRONMENTAL BARRIER. THE STABILIZER COULD FIND UNIVERSAL APPLICATION AMONG THE GROWING POPULATION OF ACTIVEWHEELCHAIR USERS. IN ADDITION, IT COULD ALSO BE ADAPTABLE TO OTHER VEHICLES THAT USE SWIVELING CASTERS, SUCH AS GROCERY CARTS AND LOADING DOCK TROLLEYS.

IN THE CALCULATIONS, WE USE THE SCATTERING MATRIX APPROACH TO PROPERLY TREAT THE PROBLEM AT THE JUNCTION BETWEEN THE CONTACTS AND THE TWO CHANNELS OF THE A-B STRUCTURE. THE SCATTERING MATRIX APPROACH ALSO ALLOW TREATMENT OF THE PROBLEM OF IMPURITY SCATTERING INTO BOTH ARMS OF THE DEVICE. THERE ARE SEVERAL ISSUES ADDRESSED IN THIS PROPOSAL. THE FIRST IS AN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SCTTERING MATRIX APPROACH TO CALCULATE ACCURATELY THE JUNCTION SCATTER WHEN THERE EXISTS A DIFFERENCE OF POTENTIAL BETWEEN BOTH ARMS OF THE AHARANOV-BOHM DEVICE (THE SO-CALLED ELECTROSTATIC A-B EFFECT). THE EFFECT OF MULTIPLE REFLECTIONS AT THE JUNCTIONS CAN THEN READILY BE INCLUDED IN THE CONDUCTANCE MODULATION OF A-B STRUCTURES BY USING THE TECHNIQUE FOR CASCADING SCATTERING MATRICES. SUCH CALCULATIONS WILL BE PERFORMED TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPORTANCE OF MULTIPLE REFLECTIONS ON THE PERFORMANCE OF ELECTROSTATIC A-B SEMICONDUCTOR HETEROSTRUCTURES AND THE INFLUENCE OF IMPURITY SCATTERING ON THE PERFORMANCE OF A-B DEVICES WILL BE INVESTIGATED. ALSO, THE ELECTRON WAVE FUNCTION AS A FUNCTION OF INCIDENT ENERGY WILL BE COMPUTED. THIS LAST STEP IS NEEDED TO CALCULATE THE IMPORTANCE OF SPACE-CHARGE EFFECTS IN A-B DEVICES.",

THE REQUISITE ROLE OF THE FIBER COATINGS IN THESE COMPOSITES IS TO MINIMIZE INTERDIFFUSION AND REACTION ZONE FORMATION AND/OR TO PROVIDE REASONABLE RESIDUAL STRESS ACCOMMODATION AT THE FIBER/MATRIX INTERFACE, WHILE MAINTAINING AN EFFECTIVE LOAD TRANSFER BETWEEN THE MATRIX AND THE FIBER. THE SPUTTER DEPOSITION PROCESS IS PROPOSED FOR THE COATING DEPOSITION, PRIMARILY BECAUSE IT OFFERS LOW-TEMPERATURE PROCESSING, EXCELLENT CONTROL IN COATING CHEMISTRY, HOMOGENEITY, AND UNIFORMITY, GOOD REPRODUCIBILITY, HIGHPURITY END-PRODUCTS, AND REALISTIC DEPOSITION RATES, COUPLED WITH EXCELLENT POSSIBILITIES OF COMMERCIALIZATION. THE PHASE I TECHNICAL OBJECTIVE IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE POTENTIAL OF THIS PROCESS FOR OBTAINING HIGHLY CONTROLLED, COMPOSITIONALLY HOMOGENEOUS, UNIFORM COATINGS OF NBC/NB, MO(2)C/MO, AND TIB(X) ALPHA-BASED TITANIUM ALUMINIDE (SUPER ALPHA(2)) COMPOSITES. THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS APPROACH WILL BE ASSESSED THROUGH OPTIMIZATION OF DEPOSITION CONDITIONS AND COATING THICKNESS, EVALUATION OF COATING INTEGRITY, COMPOSITION, AND MORPHOLOGY, AND DETERMINATION OF THE INTERFACIAL STABILITY AND INTERFACIAL STRENGTHS IN THE COMPOSITES.",

THE STRENGTH OF CARBON-CARBON COMPOSITES (C-C), PARTICULARLY AT ELEVATED TEMPERATURES, MAKES THEM AN ATTRACTIVE POTENTIAL STRUCTURAL MATERIAL FOR GAS TURBINE ENGINE APPLICATIONS. HOWEVER, THE OXIDATION THRESHOLD OF C-C IS ONLY ABOUT 370 DEG C. OPERATION AT HIGHER TEMPERATURES IN AN OXIDIZING ENVIRONMENT ULTIMATELY REQUIRES OXIDATION-PROTECTIVE COATINGS FOR EXTENDED LIFETIMES. ULTRAMET HAS DEVELOPED A PROPRIETARY OXIDATIONRESISTANT COATING SYSTEM, ULTRA 2000, BASED ON THE HAFNIUM CARBIDE/ SILICON CARBIDE (HFC/SIC) SYSTEM THAT HAS DEMONSTRATED OXIDATION PROTECTION FOR CARBON-CARBON COMPOSITES IN ONE ATMOSPHERE OF AIR AT 1800 DEG C FOR EXTENDED PERIODS (HOURS) AND TO 1925 DEG C FOR SHORTER PERIODS. THIS COATING, DEPOSITED BY CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION (CVD), UTILIZES THE FORMATION OF HAFNIUM SILICATE TO REDUCE OXYGEN DIFFUSION THROUGH THE COATING. THIS PHASE IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE STABLE THAN CURRENT INHIBITOR MATERIALS, ALLOWING THE USE OF C-C IN THE 1600-2000 DEG C RANGE. IN THIS PHASE I PROGRAM, ULTRAMET PROPOSES TO MOVE ULTRA 2000 INTO THE NEXT STAGE OF ITS DEVELOPMENT, INVOLVING OPTIMIZATION OF THE COATING THICKNESS AND STRUCTURE IN RELATION TO BOTH THERMAL AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES. THIS WILL BE FOLLOWED BY INVESTIGATION OF PROCESS SCALEUP TO LARGE IRREGULAR SURFACES.

SPECIFICALLY, ULTRAMET INTENDS TO COMBINE THE FORCED-FLOW THERMAL GRADIENT AND PULSE TECHNIQUES OF INFILTRATION, DIRECTLY RESULTING IN HIGHER QUALITY, MORE ECONOMICAL SILICON NITRIDE (SI3N4) COMPOSITES FOR USE IN IHPTET PHASE II AND III ENGINES. THE PROPOSED APPROACH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SOLVE THE RECURRING DIFFICULTY OF MICROPOROSITY BETWEEN FIBERS DUE TO INADEQUATE INFILTRATION, ELIMINATE THE SUBSTANTIAL PERMEABILITY OCCURRING IN CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART MATERIALS, AND IMPROVE THE ECONOMICS OF COMPOSITE PROCESSING VIA VASTLY REDUCED PROCESSING TIMES. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - THE DEVELOPMENT OF A DAMAGE-TOLERANT SI3N4 CERAMIC COMPOSITE WOULD PROVIDE A CRITICAL MILESTONE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH-PERFORMANCE MATERIALS FOR A WIDE VARIET# OF AEROSPACE STRUCTURAL APPLICATIONS. THE USE OF ADVANCED CERAMIC COMPOSITES IN FUTURE PROPULSION DESIGNS WOULD ALSO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL EFFICIENCY PAYOFFS IN TERMS OF OPERATING TEMPERATURE, FUEL CONSUMPTION, AND WEIGHT. KEY WORDS - CERAMIC COMPOSITES, PULSED, SILICON NITRIDE (SI3N4), COMPOSITE PROCESSING, FORCED-FLOW, CHEMICAL VAPOR INFILTRATION (CVI), THERMAL GRADIENT.",

THESE LIMITS ARE PERCEIVED AS POTENTIAL INDUCEMENTS FOR THE USSR TO CONDUCT HIDDEN TESTS OUTSIDE THE TREATY REQUIREMENTS. ONE METHOD OF SECRETLY CONDUCTING TESTS WOULD BE TO PERFORM DECOUPLED TESTS IN LARGE HIDDEN UNDERGROUND CAVITIES. THE US MUST BE PREPARED TO QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFY ATTEMPTS AT TREATY VIOLATIONS. THIS PROPOSAL SPECIFIES PROCEDURES WHICH CAN BE DEVELOPED TO IDENTIFY THE EXCAVATION OR EXISTENCE OF LARGE HIDDEN UNDERGROUND CAVITIES. ADDITIONALLY, PROCEDURES WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR IDENTIFYING LIKELY CANDIDATES FOR FUTURE CAVITY EXCAVATION, TO PROVIDE A DETERRENT. THE APPROACH TAKEN BY UTD IS TO ANALYZE ALL AVAILABLE DETECTION TECHNIQUES TO DETERMINE THEIR POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION IN DETECTING HIDDEN CAVITIES. THE GENERAL CATAGORIES OF TECHNIQUES TO BE INVESTIGATED INCLUDE: OVERHEAD IMAGERY FOR CONSTRUCTION SIGNATURE ANALYSIS; ON-SITE INSPECTION PROCEDURES UTLIZING MINING, CONSTRUCTION, AND DRILLING EXPERTISE; AND GEOPHYSICAL INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES. ONCE GENERAL PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN OUTLINED, SCENARIOS WILL BE DEVELOPED, RELYING ON RELEVENT CAVITY DETECTION CASE HISTORIES AND OTHER APPLICATIONS, TO AID IN THE DETERMINATION OF DETECTION TECHNIQUE CAPABILITIES.

THERE IS A NEED TO BETTER DEFINE DETRIMENTAL PRESENSITIZATION. THE VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL CELL IS ALWAYS THE TARGET OF REJECTION IN ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION. VEC TEC, INC., WILL DEVELOP A FROZEN PANEL OF ALLOGENEIC VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL CELLS BY IDENTIFYING THE OPTIMAL CRYOPRESERVATIVE MEDIA AND FREEZE/THAW CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR OPTIMAL VIABILITY. THE UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT WILL PERFORM CLINICAL TRIALS TO ESTABLISH OPTIMAL SHIPPING AND HANDLING CONDITIONS, AS WELL AS IDENTIFYING THE STORAGE LIFEOF VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL CELLS.

THESE CELLS ARE IMPORTANT IN STUDIES OF INFLAMMATION, NEOVASCULARIZATION, AND SEEDING OF PROSTHETIC GRAFTS. FAILURE TO GROW MICROVASCULATURE ENDOTHELIAL CELLS FOR MANY POPULATION DOUBLINGS IS DUE, IN PART, TO THE USE OF SUPPLEMENTED MEDIA THAT WERE DEVELOPED AND OPTIMIZED FOR THE CULTIVATION OF LARGE-VESSEL ENDOTHELIAL CELLS. VEC TEC, INC., IS DEVELOPING A MEDIUM THAT WILL OPTIMIZE THEGROWTH OF MICROVASCULATURE ENDOTHELIAL CELLS AND ALLOW FOR THE EXPANSION OF CELL POPULATIONS ISOLATED FROM VARIOUS COMPLEX TISSUES. IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT THE COMBINATION OF CHONDROITIN SULFATE AND ENDO GRO, A RETINAL-DERIVED ENDOTHELIAL CELL GROWTH FACTOR, ACTS SYNERGISTICALLY TO PROMOTE THE GROWTH OF MICROVASCULATURE ENDOTHELIAL CELLS FROM MURINE HEARTS. VEC TEC, INC.'S, MEDIUM PROMOTES ENHANCED GROWTH AND REPLICATION TIMES. THIS RESEARCH WILL EVALUATE THE ABILITY OF THIS MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDE AND ENDO GRO-SUPPLEMENTED MEDIUM TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF MURINE MICROVASCULATURE ENDOTHELIAL CELLS FROM ADDITIONAL ANATOMIC SITES AND DETERMINE IF THIS MEDIUM CAN EXTEND THE IN VITRO LIFE SPAN.

PROLYL ISOMERIZATION ACTIVITY IS ALSO DISPLAYED BY THE MAIN CSA BINDING PROTEIN, CYCLOPHILIN, WHICH IS SPECIFICALLY INHIBITED BY CSA. THE STUDY OF THIS ISOMERIZATION PHENOMENON AND ITS EXPLOITATION TO DEVELOP NOVEL IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS FOR THE TREATMENT OF AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE AND ORGAN TRANSPLANT REJECTION HAS BEEN HAMPERED BY TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES IN THE ISOMERIZATION ASSAY. THE GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP SUBSTRATES FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF PEPTIDYL-PROLYL CIS-TRANS ISOMERASE ACTIVITY. LONGER RANGE PLANS INVOLVE APPLYING THE UNDERSTANDING OF ISOMERASE-SUBSTRATE INTERACTIONS THUS GAINED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SPECIFIC INHIBITORS OF THESE ENZYMES. THE RESEARCH WILL ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF WHETHER CATALYSIS OF PROLYL ISOMERIZATION IS CAUSAL FOR IMMUNOSUPPRESSION OR IS MERELY AN ADVENTITIOUS PHENOMENON, POSSIBLY CONTRIBUTING TO THE TOXICITY OF THESE COMPOUNDS. THIS KNOWLEDGE WILL BE APPLIED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF IMMUNOMODULATORY DRUGS.",

THE PROPOSED METHOD CONSISTS OF ADAPTING THE ESPIRIT ALGORITHM FOR ESTIMATION OF ELEVATION ANGLE-OF-ARRIVAL TO SYNTHESIZE A 2-D ARRAY FROM THE MULTIPLE FLIGHT PATHS. THIS APPROACH ALLOWS THE COHERENT ADDITION OF THE LOW RADAR CROSS-SECTION POWER LINE SIGNATURES TO ACCUMULATE COHERENTLY IN A RANGE BIN NOT CONTAINING THE BACKGROUND. THEREFORE, THE DETECTION PROBLEM HAS BEEN EFFECTIVELY TRANFORMED FROM A VERY DIFFICULT SIGNAL/CLUTTER PROBLEM INTO A SOLUBLE SIGNAL/NOICE PROBLEM.

TO ACHEIVE THE RATE OF NEUTRON PRODUCTION (?10(-23S-1) PER DEUTERON PAIR) REQUIRES THE SOLID STATE ENVIRONMENT TO PRODUCE EITHER AN UNUSUAL ENHANCEMENT OF FUSION REACTION RATE OR A LARGE SUPPRESSION OF COULOMB BARRIER BETWEEN DEUTERONS. AS OF NOW THERE IS NO RELIABLE THEORY WHICH CAN CALCULATE THE FUSTION REACTION RATES IN LATTICE. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A RELIABLE THEORY FOR THIS PURPOSE USING QUANTUM AND STATISTICAL MECHANICS FOR WHICH WE HAVE GREAT EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE.

PART OF THIS DIFFICULTY ARISES FROM THE FACT THAT A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES (MABS) ARE INACTIVATED DURING RADIOLABELING PROCEDURES AND SUCH MABS, WHEN INJECTEDINTRAVENOUSLY, LOCALIZE NONSPECIFICALLY IN NORMAL TISSUES. THIS PROJECT ADDRESSES THE PROBLEM THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INNOVATIVE METHOD FOR EFFECTIVELY SEPARATING ANTIBODIES DAMAGED DURING RADIOLABELING PROCEDURES FROM THOSE RETAINING THEIR ORIGINAL AFFINITY AND SPECIFICITY. PRELIMINARY STUDIES INDICATE THAT ANTI-IDIOTYPIC (ANTI-ID) MABS RECOGNIZING THE COMBINING SITES OF ANTIMELANOMA MABS CAN BE PREPARED AS AFFINITY MATRICES TO PURIFY THE ANTIMELANOMA MABS AFTER RADIOLABELING PROCEDURES. THE IMMUNOREACTIVITY, SPECIFICITY, AFFINITY, AND TUMOR-TO-TISSUE RATIOS OF IN-111-LABELED ANTIMELANOMA MABS WILL BE ASSAYED BEFORE AND AFTER IMMUNOAFFINITY PURIFICATION WITH ANTI-ID MABS. IF THE METHOD IS EFFECTIVE,IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO INCREASE THE SENSITIVITY OF TUMOR DETECTION BY RADIOIMMUNOSCINTIGRAPHY.",

THIS CAPABILITY FOR REAL-TIME, RANGE-RESOLVED POLARIZATION ANALYSIS OF ATMOSPHERIC BACKSCATTER WOULD BE UNIQUE TO THE ABLE LIDAR SYSTEM. IT WOULD ENABLE THE AIR FORCE TO ACQUIRE BOTH GROUNDBASED AND BALLOONBORNE POLARIZATION DATA OF GREATER ACCURACY THAN IS CURRENTLY ATTAINABLE. DATA OBTAINED BY EXISTING LIDAR SYSTEMS ARE BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE POLARIZATION OF THE BACKSCATTER RADIATION IS UNCHANGED FROM THAT TRANSMITTED. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM WILL TEST THAT ASSUMPTION. IT IS PROPOSED TO STUDY THE FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING A VARIABLE POLARIZATION SYSTEM WHICH WOULD INCLUDE STATE-OF-THE-ART VARIABLE LIQUID CRYSTAL RETARDERS HAVING HIGH LASER DAMAGE THRESHOLDS. THESE RETARDERS WOULD ALTERNATELY SWITCH THE POLARIZATION OF THE THREE TRANSMITTED LIDAR WAVELENGTHS, 1064, 532, AND 355 NM. SIMILARLY AN ALTERNATELY SWITCHED POLARIZATION ANALYZER WOULD BE INCORPORATED INTO THE LIDAR RECEIVER.

THE NEW ALLOYS FORMED BY ADDING CHROMIUM OR MANGANESE TO AL3TI READILY FORM A DESIRABLE SCALE OF AL2O3 IN OXIDIZING ATMOSPHERES AND HAVE GREATLY IMPROVED MECHANICAL PROPERTIES AND OXIDATION RESISTANCE (AT 2200 DEG F) OVER EARLIER MODIFICATIONS OF AL3TI. THE PROGRAM WILL USE STATE-OF-THE-ART LOW PRESSURE PLASMA SPRAY TECHNIQUES TO PRODUCE COATINGS ON BOTH CONVENTIONAL AND INTERMETALLIC TITANIUM BASED ALLOYS. POWDERS OF THE COATING ALLOYS TO BE USED IN THE PLASMA SPRAY PROCESS WILL BE PRODUCED BY A STATE-OF-THE-ART ATOMIZATION PROCESS.",

THE WARNING DEVICE WOULD HELP AVOID THECONSEQUENCES OF A MISTAKE BY HALTING DRUG DELIVERY UNTIL THECHOICE OF DRUG IS VERIFIED BY THE ANESTHESIOLOGIST. AN ARGON LASER (488 NM) WILL BE USED TO IDENTIFY THE MAJOR RAMAN SCATTERING PEAKS FOR 41 COMMON PERIANESTHETIC DRUGS. A CLASSIFICATION TECHNIQUE WILL BE DEVELOPED TO UNIQUELY IDENTIFY EACH DRUG IN CLINICAL CONCENTRATIONS, ACCORDING TO THE FEATURES IN ITS RAMAN SPECTRUM. A FLOWMETER WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR USE WITH THE RAMAN SYSTEM TO MEASURE INTRAVENOUS FLOW RATES (0.1 TO 60 ML/MIN, 10 PERCENT ACCURACY), SO THE AMOUNT OF DRUG INJECTED CAN BE CALCULATED. THE ACCURACY OF THE FLOWMETER WILL BE TESTED USING RAPID AND SLOW SYRINGE INJECTIONS. THE SYSTEM WILL BE TESTED SIMULATING A CLINICAL ENVIRONMENT WHERE 41 DRUGS ARE INJECTED IN TYPICAL DILUTIONSAND AT TYPICAL FLOW RATES. THE RESULTS WILL DOCUMENT THE ACCURACY OF DRUG IDENTIFICATION AND THE MEASUREMENT ERROR FOR THE AMOUNT OF DRUG INFUSED. RESULTS WILL LEAD TO A PORTABLE RAMAN ANALYZER WHERE THE SAMPLE CUVETTE AND FLOWMETER ARE PLACED IN THE INTRAVENOUS LINE GOING TO THE PATIENT.",

WGL PROPOSES TO INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING PRESSURE COMPENSATED CELL CONTAINMENT AND UTILIZING THIS TECHNOLOGY IN CONJUNCTION WITH LITHIUM (LI) PRIMARY CELL SYSTEMS TO MAXIMIZE ENERGY DENSITY. TWO LITHIUM CELL SYSTEMS WILL BE INVESTIGATED: (I) LI/CSC (CHLORINATED SULFURYL CHLORIDE) AND (II) LI/CFX (CARBON MONOFLUORIDE). THE METHOD OF PRESSURE COMPENSATION TO BE INVESTIGATED WILL BE INCORPORATION OF BELLOWS INTO THE CELL CONTAINER FOR EQUALIZATION OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL PRESSURE. THE EXPERIMENTS WILL FOCUS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROTOTYPE CELLS OF THE TWO LITHIUM CHEMISTRIES AND THE PERFORMANCE OF ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE TESTING AT BOTH ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE AND 10,000 PSI.

RECENTLY, AZT HAS BEEN RECOMMENDED AND APPROVED FOR USE BY HIV-POSITIVE, ASYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS, INCLUDING CHILDREN. HOWEVER, ITS SIDE EFFECTS ARE OFTEN DANGEROUS. ALTHOUGH MUCH HAS BEEN LEARNED ABOUT THE DRUG AND ITS ACTIVITY AS AN ANTIVIRAL AGENT, VERY LITTLE IS KNOWNOF EFFECTIVE SERUM LEVELS OR THE RELATIONSHIP (IF ANY) BETWEEN SERUM LEVELS AND THE THERAPEUTIC INDEX. AT THE PRESENT TIME, ONLY HPLC AND RIA METHODS ARE AVAILABLEFOR MONITORING AZT SERUM LEVELS. THEY ARE RELATIVELY SLOW, EXPENSIVE, LABOR INTENSIVE, AND IMPRACTICAL FOR ROUTINE PHARMACOKINETIC STUDIES.

THIS INNOVATIVE CONCEPT WOULD INVESTIGATE THE APPLICATION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGY, SPECIFICALLY HYPERMEDIA TECHNOLOGY WITH EMBEDDEDEXPERT SYSTEMS, TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND REQUIREMENTS OF COUNTY AGENTS. THIS MEETS A USDA NEED FOR INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY TO ASSIST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN RURAL AREAS. COUNTY AGENTS ARE REQUIRED TO ANSWER AND RESEARCH A VARIETY OF QUESTIONS ON A VAST ARRAY OF AGRICULTURAL PROBLEMS FOR LOCAL CITIZENS. QUESTIONS RANGE FROM INDETIFICATION OF PESTS AND DISEASES, TO CONTROL METHODOLOGIES AND OTHER FACETS OF AGRICULTURE. ADDITIONALLY, THEY MUST HAVE ACCESS TO EXPERTS SUCH AS PLANT PATHOLOGISTS, ENTOMOLOGISTS AND WEED SCIENTISTS. THE PROGRESS BEING MADE TODAY IN THE TECHNOLOGY OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP A HYPERMEDIA SYSTEM FOR THE COUNTY AGENT. OUR TECHNICAL APPROACH IS TO INTERVIEW SELECTED EXPERTS IN THE COUNTY AGENT ENVIRONMENT, DOCUMENT THEIR DECISION PROCESSES, SELECT PROGRAMMING TECHNIQUES, DEVELOP AKNOWLEDGE BASE, AND FINALLY DEVELOP A HYPERMEDIA SYSTEM PROTOTYPE. THIS APPROACH WILL RESULT IN DEMONSTRATING THE FEASIBILITY OF CAAS AND WILL BE THE FOUNDATION OF A FULL-UP OPERATIONAL PROTOTYPE EFFORT IN PHASE II. AT THE END OF THE PHASE II EFFORT, USDA WILL POSSES A DOCUMENTED SOFTWARE PACKAGE AND HARDWARE SPECIFICATIONS TO OPTIMALLY RUN THE CAAS. THIS PROGRAM WILL CONTAIN THE ACCUMULATED KNOWLEDGE AND DECISION PROCESS OF SELECTED USDA AND COUNTY AGENT EXPERTS. POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: XMCO STRONGLY BELIEVES CAAS COULD BE REPACKAGED INTO A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS AND RETAILED TO THE CONSUMERS ENGAGED IN GARDENING. FOR EXAMPLE, A PROGRAM FOR VEGETABLE GARDENERS WOULD OFFER EXPERT ADVICE ON HOW TO PLAN, PREPARE, PLANT CARE FOR, HARVEST, AND STORE VEGETABLES.

THE TECHNIQUE ALLOWS MUCH GREATER SEPARABILITY OF THE SIGNALS THAN THE CONVENTIONAL DEMODULATION APPROACH, THEREBY OVERCOMING THE USUAL NEAR-FAR INTERFERENCE PROBLEM ASSOCIATED WITH CDMA SYSTEMS. THE PROPOSAL IS FOCUSED ON A SONOBUOY TRANSMISSION SCENARIO IN WHICH THE AMOUNT OF BANDWIDTH EXPANSION IS LIMITED TO 1:100 (20 DB), AND WHERE DEMODULATION OF EACH WEAK CDMA SIGNAL REQUIRES MORE THAN 20 DB REJECTION OF STRONG COCHANNEL SIGNALS. REQUIRING ONLY A SINGLE RECEIVE ANTENNA, THE NEW TECHNIQUE INCLUDES THE AJ CAPABILITY TO REJECT OTHER COCHANNEL INTERFERENCES HAVING A VARIETY OF WAVEFORM TYPES. THE TECHNIQUE CAN BE READILY IMPLEMENTED WITH AVAILABLE DIGITAL COMPONENTS. A COMPUTER SIMULATION IS PROPOSED TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THIS TECHNIQUE.",

THE TTK IS A HANDS-FREE INPUT DEVICE CONSISTING OF AN INTRAORAL DENTAL RETAINER MODIFIED TO INCLUDE A NINE-KEY MEMBRANE KEYPAD, DIGITAL ENCODER, AND LOW-POWER RADIO TRANSMITTER WHICH TRANSMITS ENCODED KEYSTROKES TO A RECEIVERLOCATED NEAR THE USER'S HEAD. THE KEYSTROKES, ONCE DECODED BY THE CONTROLLER, ARE TRANSLATED INTO TEXT OR MOUSE MOVEMENT ON A COMPUTER SCREEN, OR A CONTROL COMMAND SENT TO AN ARRAY OF EQUIPMENT AND APPLIANCES SUCH AS A VCR, TELEVISION, TELEPHONE, PAGE TURNER AND AN APPLE MACINTOSH COMPUTER. COUPLED WITH MEDIA EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS, DESIGNEDFOR USE IN THE HOME, HOSPITAL AND RURAL OR SATELLITE SETTINGS, THE FIRM'S TECHNOLOGY APPEARS TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL FOR IMPROVING THE EDUCATION OF DISABLED CHILDREN. A SUCCESSFUL PROJECT WILL HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE FIRM'S TECHNOLOGY HAS SIGNIFICANT APPLICATIONS IN THE EDUCATION OF CHILDREN THROUGH AGE 21 WITH MOBILITY DISABILITIES THAT RESTRICT THEIR ATTENDANCE IN TYPICAL CLASSROOM SETTINGS. INADDITION IT IS HOPED THAT THE STUDY'S CONCLUSIONS WILL SHOW THAT THE FIRM'S TECHNOLOGY HAS EDUCATIONAL APPLICATIONS FOR DISABLED CHILDREN IN THE CLASSROOM SETTING AS WELL. IN PARTICULAR, A SUCCESSFUL PROJECT WILL HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT: 1) THE TTK AND CONTROLLER ALLOWS CONTROL OVER EDUCATIONAL EQUIPMENT SUCH AS TV, VCR, TAPE RECORDER, AND COMPUTER, AND IS SUPERIOR TO OTHER PRODUCTS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE COMMERCIALLY; 2) THE TEXT ENTRY RATE OF THE TTK IS SUPERIOR TO OTHER COMPUTER ACCESS INPUT DEVICES WHICH ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO THE DISABLED, AND IS SUFFICIENTLY HIGH TO AVOID USER FRUSTRATION, THERBY IMPROVING THEIR ABILITY AND DESIRE TO PARTICIPATE IN INSTRUCTION AND THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS; 3) THE TTK, BEING ESSENTIALLY INVISIBLE WHEN WORN, REDUCES THE USER'S SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS, THEREBY IMPROVING THEIR ABILITY AND DESIRE TO PARTICIPATE IN INSTRUCTION AND THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS. ONCE THE ABOVE MENTIONED ADVANTAGES OF THE FIRM'S PRODUCT HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED, THE FIRM WILL BE IN A POSITION TO MARKET ITS PRODUCT TO THE DISABLED COMMUNITY FOR EDUCATIONALAPPLICATIONS, ESPECIALLY TO DISABLED CHILDREN WHO HAVE THE CAPACITY AND DESIRE TO LEARN.",

THIS NEW TEST WOULD COMPLEMENT SERIAL QUANTITATIVE BETA-HCG AND ULTRASOUND TESTING, CURRENTLY USEDFOR DIAGNOSING EP, AND PROVIDE EARLIER AND MORE ACCURATE DIAGNOSIS OF THIS POTENTIALLY FATAL CONDITION. THE NEW TEST IS BASED ON A RECENTLY DISCOVERED MARKER, A UNIQUE PREGNANCY-RELATED PROTEIN (PRP) SECRETED BY THE PROLIFERATIVE TROPHOBLAST DURING THE EARLY STAGES OF PREGNANCY. PRP CAN BE IMMUNOLOGICALLY DETECTED BY A MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY, KNOWN AS A137, DEVELOPED AT ASPEN DIAGNOSTICS CORPORATION. PRP IS PRESENT IN THE CERVICAL MUCOUS OF PREGNANT WOMEN WITH INTRAUTERINE IMPLANTATION BUT APPEARS TO BE ABSENT IN WOMEN WITH EXTRAUTERINE IMPLANTATION. THE ABILITY TO PREDICT THE LOCATION OF A PREGNANCY COULD PROVIDE EARLIER, NONINVASIVE DIAGNOSIS OF EP, BYPASSING COSTLY ULTRASOUND OR INVASIVE DIAGNOSTIC LAPAROSCOPY. FURTHERMORE, RAPID AND ACCURATE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT COULD LOWER THE RATE OF TUBAL RUPTURE, THEREBY LOWERING MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY ASSOCIATED WITH EP. EARLY DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF EP MAY ALSO IMPROVE FUTURE FERTILITY OF THE AFFECTED PATIENT.",

DEVELOPMENT OF SOURCE COUPLED FET LOGIC (SCFL) LEAF CELLS WILL BE INVESTIGATED FOR APPLICATIONS THAT REQUIRE VERY HIGH SPEED GAAS DATAPATH LOGIC. SCFL OFFERS HIGHER SPEED AT THE EXPENSE OF INCREASED POWER COMSUMPTION AND LARGER LEAF CELLS. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - DEVELOPMENT OF GAAS DATAPATH LEAF CELLS WILL ENABLE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT DESIGNERS TO IMPLEMENT DESIGNS IN EITHER CMOS OR GAAS, AFTER COMPLETION OF THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN. UPON COMPLETION OF THIS PROGRAM, FUNCTIONAL LEVEL ASIC DESIGNS CAN BE TRANSPARENTLY IMPLEMENTED IN GAAS OR CMOS, AS REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE OPTIMIXAED SYSTEM PERFORMANCE, E.G. HIGHER PERFORMANCE OR LOWER POWER COMSUPMTION. KEY WORDS - GALLIUM ARSENIDE, GAAS, DATAPATH COMPILER, LOGIC SYNTHESIS, CAE.",

THIS CONCEPT UTILIZES A UNIQUE 3-AXIS FORCE TRANSDUCER DESIGNED TO BE RUGGED, SENSITIVE, AND MOTIONLESS. THE PROPOSED DESIGN HAS A FIXED-POSITION SENSING ELEMENT CAPABLE OF MEASURING VELOCITY HEADING AND FLOW DIRECTION OVER A COMPLETE 360-DEGREE ANGLE. THIS WILL PRODUCE A 3-AXIS VELOCITY VECTOR THAT WILL ENABLE THE DETERMINATION OF ANGLE-OF-ATTACKAND ANGLE-OF-SIDESLIP. BY INCORPORATING A MICROPROCESSOR INTO THE SAASS, IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO DIGITALLY COMPENSATE FOR AIRFLOW TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE TO CALCULATE ABSOLUTE VELOCITY. A PROTOTYPE AIRFLOW SENSOR WITH A SENSITIVITY OF 1 DEGREE WILL BE DESIGNED, FABRICATED, AND TESTED DURING THE PHASE I EFFORT. BY COMBINING A SIMPLE MECHANICAL DESIGNWITH LOW COST CMOS VLSI CIRCUITRY, A PROBE CAN BE DEVELOPED AT A COST OF APPROXIMATELY $200/UNIT. THE PROBE, SOFTWARE, AND SERIAL INTERFACE WILL BE DELIVERED TO NASA AT PHASE I COMPLETION FOR DEMONSTRATION ON A STANDARD IBM PC.",
