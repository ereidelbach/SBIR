CONSIDERATION IS MADE NOT ONLY OF THE DISPERSAL OF CONVENTIONAL INS BOXES, BUT THE ABACUS INNOVATIVE APPROACH ALSO INCLUDES THE BROADER QUESTION OF THE ORIENTATION OF DISPERSED/PACKAGED SENSORS TO BALANCE THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS TO MINIMIZE THE PERFORMANCE DEGRADATION. THE TYPES OF DEGRADATION CONSIDERED INCLUDE NAVIGATION ACCURACY AND THE SENSITIVITY TO FAILURE DETECTION/CORRECTION AND FALSE ALARMS. THE INVESTIGATION WILL INCLUDE BOTH PLATFORM AND STRAPDOWN INS CONFIGURATIONS. THERE WILL BE INSTANCES WHERE THERE ARE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PLATFORM AND STRAPDOWN CONFIGURATIONS.",

SEVERAL CONFIGURATIONS OF THE CONCEPT WILL BE EVALUATED INCLUDING SINGLESTAGE AND TWO-STAGE PRECIPITATION AND PARTICLE PRECHARGING. THE ELECTROSTATIC ENHANCEMENT WILL PROVIDE THE COLLECTION MECHANISM REQUIRED TO EFFICIENTLY COLLECT PARTICLES IN THE 0.1 TO 1.0 MICRON RANGE THAT ARE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO COLLECT USING AN INERTIAL SPRAY SYSTEM. THIS SYSTEM ALLOWS USE OF NOZZLES DESIGNED TO PRODUCE A VERY FINE SPRAY TO OPTIMIZE THE SURFACE AREA FOR GAS REMOVAL. THE ELECTROSTATIC COLLECTOR ALSO ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR A HIGH PRESSURE DROP INERTIAL MIST ELIMINATOR.",

THE MAJOR OBSTACLESTO SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION OF PRESENT ULTRAFAST PHOTOCONDUCTIVE SEMICONDUCTORS TO PULSED POWER APPLICATIONS ARE LOW BREAKDOWN VOLTAGE, HIGH DARK CURRENT AND CONCURRENT THERMAL RUNAWAY EFFECTS AT HIGH PULSE REPETITION RATES. IN ORDER TO OVERCOME THESE PROBLEMS, IT IS NECESSARY TO CONSIDER VERY WIDE BANDGAP, LARGE DIELECTRIC STRENGTH SEMICONDUCTING MATERIALS SUCH AS DIAMOND. DIAMOND EXHIBITS ULTRAFAST PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY, HAS DARK RESISTIVITIES IN EXCESS OF 10(13) MICRON-CM, EXTREMELY HIGH THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY, AND SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER DIELECTRIC BREAKDOWN STRENGTH THAN EITHER SI, GAAS OR INP.

FOLLOWING APPLICATION AND CURING, THESE POLYMERS WILL FORM ACOVALENT BONDING TO METAL AND NON-METAL SURFACES, AND THE FINAL COATINGS ARE NON-PERMEABLE TO CORROSIVE GASES, OXIDATION RESISTANT, HIGH-EROSION AND HIGH-TEMPERATURE RESISTANT, AND RELATIVELY LOW COST. THEREFORE, THESE POLYMERS HAVE GREAT POTENTIAL TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE INTENDED USUAGE STATED ABOVE. IN PHASE I STUDIES, VARIOUS SUBSTRATE COUPONS COMMONLY USED FOR COMPONENTS IN THE SPACE INDUSTRY WILL BE COATED WITH THESE POLYMERS FORPRELIMINARY TESTINGS OF THE SURFACE PROPERTIES. IN PHASE IIWORK WILL INVOLVE FURTHER CHARACTERIZATION OF THESE COATINGSAND VARIOUS MEANS OF SURFACE APPLICATIONS TO SIMULATED AND REAL ENVIRONMENTAL TESTINGS. THE SUCCESS OF THIS STUDY WILLPROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL BENEFITS TO THE SPACE PROGRAM IN NASA, TO BOTH CIVIL AND MILITARY NEEDS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, AND WILL FULFILL MANY NEEDS FOR COATING OF A WIDE-RANGE OF COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS WHERE THE PRESENT COATINGS ARE INADEQUATE.",

THE FILAMENTS WILL BE HIGH QUALITY (LOW GRAPHITE CONTENT AND GOOD UNIFORMITY) AND BE AT LEAST 1 MM LONG.

CONSEQUENTLY, THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROCESSES WHICH UTILIZE LIGNIN FOR THIS PURPOSE HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR A HIGHPAYOFF. PREVIOUS WORK SUGGESTS THAT AN APPROPRIATE MODIFICATION OF THE COMPOSITION OF LIGNIN-DERIVED PITCH COULD GREATLY ENHANCE ITS SUITABILITY AS A PRECURSOR MATERIAL. THE GENERATION OF A MESOPHASE FROM PYROLYSIS OF PITCH ONLY OCCURS IF SEVERAL CONDITIONS ARE MET. THE INTERMOLECULAR REACTIVITY IS A KEY FACTOR, AS IF THIS IS TOOHIGH, THE SYSTEM WILL CROSSLINK AT TEMPERATURES BELOW THOSE IN WHICH MESOPHASE IS GENERATED AND THE SYSTEM SOLIDIFIES TO FORM AN ISOTROPIC CARBON. THIS REACTIVITY CAN BE CONTROLLED BY CHEMICAL AND/OR THERMAL TREATMENT OF THE LIGNIN TO REMOVE REACTIVE FUNCTIONAL GROUPS. THESE TREATMENTS CAN ALSO BE USED TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE AVERAGE MOLECULAR WEIGHT, WHICH WILL TEND TO REDUCE THE REACTIVITY, AND THE VISCOSITY, BOTH OF WHICH ARE MORE FAVORABLE FOR MESOPHASE FORMATION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PHASE I PROGRAM WOULD BE TO INVESTIGAT THE APPROPRIATE THERMAL AND CHEMICAL TREATMENTS THAT WOULD LEAD TO THE OPTIMUM COMPOSITION FOR THE USE OF THE LIQUID PRODUCTS FROM LIGNIN AS A PRECURSOR FOR CARBON FIBER PRODUCTION. THE EXPERIMENTS WOULD BE DONE IN A NOVEL REACTOR SYSTEM EQUIPPEDWITH A POST-PYROLYSIS ISOTHERMAL CRACKING ZONE FOR THERMAL TREATMENT OF THE TARS IN ORDER TO \"TAILOR\" THEIR COMPOSITIONFOR CARBON FIBER PRODUCTION.

HOWEVER, EFFECTIVE UTILIZATION OF THIS TECHNOLOGY RELIES ON OPTIMUM CONTROL ANDCONTINUAL ADJUSTMENT OF MANIPULATED VARIABLES WITH RESPECT TO FLOTATION PERFORMANCE SINCE THE RETENTION TIME OF COAL/WATER SLURRY IN THE ASH UNIT IS LESS THAN ONE SECOND. FLUCTUATION OF OTHER OPERATING VARIABLES IN PLANT OPERATION AND THE CURRENT INABILITY TO RAPIDLY DETERMINE CHANGES IN FLOTATION PERFORMANCE IN REAL TIME HAVE LIMITED THE USE OF THE ASH TECHNOLOGY IN COAL PREPARATION PLANTS. PRELIMINARY STUDY INDICATES THAT A CORRELATION BETWEEN PRESSURE MEASUREMENTS, OPERATING VARIABLES, AND FLOTATION PERFORMANCE CAN BE ESTABLISHED AND SUCH A CORRELATION MODEL CAN BE USED AS A BASIS TO CONTROL FLOTATION PERFORMANCE. SINCE THESE PRESSURE MEASUREMENTS CAN BE DETERMINED IN REAL TIME DURING ASH FLOTATION, AUTOMATIC CONTROL AND OPTIMUM ADJUSTMENT OF THESE MANIPULATED VARIABLES CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED.

VARIOUS \"SOFT HUB\" STIFFNESS WILL BE ANALYZED TO OBTAIN A MATCH OF MISSION REQUIREMENT AND ROTORCRAFT RESPONSE REQUIREMENT. THE \"SOFT HUB\" ROTOR CONCEPT HAS UNIVERSAL APPLICATIONS FOR ROTOR SYSTEMS ALLOWING CO-PLANER BMR ROTOR CONFIGURATIONS WITH 3, 4, 5, 6,AND 7 BLADES. A PHASE II PROOF OF CONCEPT SCALED WIND TUNNEL TEST WOULD PROVE THE \"SOFT HUB\" CAPABILITIES AND GENERATE A DATA BASE FOR FULL SCALE DESIGN. THE DEVELOPED SYSTEM COULD BE OF ENORMOUS VALUE TO MILITARY AND CIVILIAN ROTORCRAFT INDUSTRIES.",

WITH AN INTRACAVITY MULTIPASS CELL, THE OPTICAL ABSORPTION PATHLENGTH CAN BE INCREASED BY A FACTOR OF TEN TO THIRTY OVER THE TYPICAL VALUES ( 1 METER) OF EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEMS REPORTED IN THE LITERATURE. THUS WE MAY INCREASE THE SENSITIVITY OF INTRACAVITY LASER SPECTROSCOPY BY A FACTOR OF TEN OR MORE OVER THE PREVIOUS STATE OF THE ART. THERE ARE NUMEROUS IMPORTANT ATMOSPHERIC TRACE GASES WITH ABSORPTION LINES IN THE VISIBLE TO NEAR ULTRAVIOLET WHICH MAY BE MEASURED WITH ALONG-CAVITY ILS INSTRUMENT. THESE GASES INCLUDE NO3, NO2, O3, SO2, HNO2, CH2O, AND OH. THE ABSORPTION CROSS SECTIONS FOR THESE GASES ARE MODERATE, BUT THEIR EXTREMELY LOW CONCENTRATIONS (SOME BELOW PART-PER-TRILLION LEVELS) MAKE THEM DIFFICULT TO MEASURE. OUR GENERAL GOAL FOR PHASE I RESEARCH IS TO DEMONSTRATE AND EXPLORE THE BEHAVIOR OF A TUNABLE DYE LASER THAT HAS AN INTRACAVITY LONG-PATH MULTI-PASS ABSORPTION CELL. WE ALSO HAVE THE GOAL OF MAKINGA PRELIMINARY EVALUATION OF THE APPLICABILITY OF SUCH A LASER SYSTEM TO THE PROBLEM OF MEASURING WEAKLY ABSORBING ATMOSPHERIC GASES.

A SIMPLE AND EFFECTIVE PASSIVE PITCH CONTROL USING A BEAM-TORQUE MEMBER MOUNTED WITHIN THE BLADE STRUCTURE AND ATTACHED TO THE BLADE AT A STATION AT ABOUT HALF THE PROPELLER RADIUS IS DESCRIBED. THIS STRUCTURAL PROCEDURE IS NOT POSSIBLE ON CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT PROPELLERS, BUT THE SMALLER SCALE AND POWER OUTPUT OF THE UAV MAKE IT ACCEPTABLE IN THIS CASE.

A THEORETICAL COMPARISON OF THE PROPOSED SEPARATOR WITH WORK PUBLISHED ON OPEN GRADIENT MAGNETIC SEPARATION BY THE OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LABORATORY INDICATES THAT THE SEPARATOR WILL HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF ASH CLEANING. THIS IS BECAUSE OF ITS COUNTERCURRENT PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION, THE HIGH GRADIENT MAGNETIC FIELD OCCURRING IN THE NARROW GAP THROUGH WHICH THE COAL IS TRANSPORTED AND THE LIMITED MOVEMENT NECESSARY TO EFFECT SEPARATION. LOW PROCESSING COST AND HIGH LEVELS OF PYRITIC SULFUR REMOVAL ARE EXPECTED. THE SEPARATOR CAN BE LINEARLY AND ECONOMICALLY SCALED TO MANY TONS PER HOUR. THE SEPARATOR HAS BEEN TESTED ON DRY 10 MICRON DIAMETER COALAND MEASURABLE SEPARATION OF BOTH ASH AND SULFUR WAS OBTAINED. VERY STRONG ELECTROSTATIC EFFECTS WERE ALSO OBSERVED, THAT IN SOME CASES WERE SUFFICIENT TO REVERSE THE SEPARATION. THEORETICAL ANALYSIS OF THE DRY MAGNETIC SEPARATION INCLUDING THE ELECTROSTATIC EFFECTS EXPLAINS BOTH THE SIGN AND MAGNITUDE OF THE OBSERVED SEPARATIONS. THIS SAME ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT USING A CONDUCTIVE FLUID WITH A RESISTIVITY LESS THAN 3 X 10(5) CM COMPLETELY ELIMINATE ALL ELECTROSTATIC EFFECTS.

HOWEVER, THE POSITIVE POTENTIAL (V(O)) INITIALLY APPLIED ON THE CENTER CONDUCTOR DECAYS CONTINUALLY AS THE DISCHARGE CURRENT INCREASES DUE TO THE INDUCTIVE LOAD OF THE ORBITRON TUBE, THEREBY PREMATURELY TERMINATING THE EMISSION OF HIGH FREQUENCY COMPONENTS (F(O)?SQ RT V(O)). SIMPLE REPLACEMENT OF THE CAPACITOR WITH A BATTERY IS NOT ECONOMICAL, BUT ALSO FLATTENS THE POTENTIALWELL AS THE DISCHARGE CURRENT INCREASES BEYOND THE TRANSITION FROM GLOW TO ARC. FOR SINGLY POWERED ORBITRONS, MORE THAN HALF THE RADIALLY INJECTED ELECTRONS IS LOST DIRECTLY TO THE ANODE, BEFORE PARTICIPATING IN THE MILLIMETERWAVE OSCILLATION BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF ACCELERATION BEFORE COLLISIONS. THE MAJOR EFFORT OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO OVERCOME THE PROBLEM OF LOW EFFICIENCY THROUGH A MINIMUM MODIFICATION OF THE ORIGINAL ORBITRON MASER. TWO SEPARATE POWER SUPPLIES, ONE FOR THE POTENTIAL-WELL AND ANOTHER FOR THE ELECTRON BEAM, WILL BE EMPLOYED. A NOVEL SCHEME WOULD CONSERVE THE POTENTIAL-WELL UP TO VERY HIGH VOLTAGES, IMPORTANT FOR HIGH FRE-N QUENCY GENERAGION. THE ELECTRON BEAM WILL BE INJECTED EXTERNALLY BY MINIATURE GUNS IN THE TANGENTIAL DIRECTION SO THAT A MAJORITY OF ELECTRONS UNDERGOES A HELICAL ORBIT BEFORE REACHING THE CENTER CONDUCTOR (ANODE). OUR PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENT WITH A COLD-CATHODE ELECTRON GUN WAS ENCOURAGING. THE USEFULNESS OF A NUMBER OF SUCH GUNS AND THE EFFECT OF NON-ORTHOGONAL (WITH RESPECT TO THE TUBE AXIS) INJECTION WILL BE INVESTIGATED IN TERMS OF POWER AND EFFICIENCY ENHANCEMENT DURING THE PHASE I PERIOD. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL INCLUDE EXTENTION OF THEORY, PROOF-OF-THEORY EXPERIMENTATION ASSISTED BY NOVEL DIAGNOSTIC TECHNIQUES, AND FABRICATION AND CHARATERIZATION OF THE MODIFIED ORBITRON PROTOTYPE.",

THE OBJECTIVES OF THE PHASE I EFFORT WILL FOCUS ON THE EVALUATION, IN A PARALLEL COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE, OF PROBABILISTIC MONTE CARLO IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES, INCLUDING PIPELINING (VECTORIZATION), CONCURRENCY (MULTITASKING), SYNCHRONIZATION, AND VARIANCE REDUCTION TECHNIQUES. WHILE MUCH OF THE RESEARCH IN PSM OVER THE LASTTWO DECADES HAS FOCUSED ON BASIC THEORY DEVELOPMENT, THE NEXT DECADE OF RESEARCH IN COMPUTATIONAL PSM MAY OPEN UP A WHOLE NEW CLASS OF FINITE ELEMENT AND DYNAMICS PROBLEMS TO PROBABILISTIC STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS.",

        "abstract": "A FEASIBILITY STUDY IS PROPOSED ON A NOVEL CONCEPT FOR A GENERATION OF A VERY LIGHTWEIGHT, HIGHLY FOCUSED GAMMA RADIATION BEAM USEFUL FOR MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS IN DEFENSE SUCH AS KILL OF ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS IN LAND WARFARE, AND (AS DESCRIBED HEREIN) DISCRIMINATION OF TARGETS IN SPACE. THE DEVICE IS SMALL ENOUGH TO \"PIGGY BACK\" ON THE PROPOSED REENTRY VEHICLE (RV) INTERCEPTOR MISSILES, OR BE CARRIED IN CONVENTIONAL ARTILLERY AND TANK PROJECTILES FOR USE IN LAND WARFARE. THIS CONCEPT UTILIZES AN EXPLOSIVELY COLLAPSED BETATRON TO GENERATE HIGH ENERGY ELECTRONS WHICH ARE THEN DIRECTED INTO A CONVERTER SHIELD COMPOSED OF DENSE METAL SUCH AS TANTALUM. THE KINETIC ENERGY OF THE ELECTRONS IS THEN CONVERTED TO GAMMA RADIATION WHICH IS PROJECTED FORWARD IN A HIGHLY FOCUSED, BEAM-LIKE GEOMETRY. ELECTRONIC KILL OR TARGET DISCRIMINATION OCCURS WHEN THE GAMMA RAYS PENETRATE INTO OBJECTS IN THEIR PATH, INTERACTING WITH THE ATOMIC STRUTURES OF THE TARGETS, THUS CAUSING DAMAGE AND MEASURABLE SECONDARY EMISSIONS. THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES USE OF THE DGRB IN THE EXOATMOSPHERIC DISCRIMINATION ROLE, ONE OF THE POSSIBLE APPLICATIONS FOR THIS DIRECTED ENERGY BEAM.",

A MAJOR STEP TOWARD A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION TO THE ELECTROLYTIC CORROSION PROBLEM WILL BE MADE BY FORMULATING A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK AND PREDICTIVE MODEL FOR COMPARISON WITH OBSERVATION AND RESULTS OF EXPERIMENTAL TEST WORK. IN ADDITION TO GENERAL CORROSION SCIENCE AND PASSIVITY, RELEVANT TECHNICAL AREAS THAT WILL BE DRAWN UPON INCLUDE ELECTROCHEMICAL REACTIONS AND HYDRODYNAMICS, ANODIZATION BEHAVIOR, AND ELECTROLYTIC CAPACITORS AND LEAKAGE CURRENT, WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO EFFECTS OF VOLTAGE MODULATION. TESTING UNDER SIMULATED SERVICE CONDITIONS WILL BE DONE TO EVALUATE POSSIBLE MITIGATION MEASURES, INCLUDING ALTERNATIVE HOSE FITTING COMPOSITIONS AND MODIFICATIONS TO THE COOLANT. PROMISING MITIGATIONN MEASURES WILL BE PROPOSED FOR EVALUATION BY THE NAVY OR FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT IN A FOLLOW-ON PROGRAM.",

THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS OUR APPROACH IS TWOFOLD. FIRST, DETECTION PERFORMANCE CAN BE DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED FOR THE DETECTION OF TARGETS IN SEVERE BACKGROUND CLUTTER, IN WHICH EXCESSIVE FALSE ALARMS ARE A TYPICAL PROBLEM. SECONDLY, MORPHOLOGY-BASED ALGORITHMS CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN VERY HIGH-SPEED HARDWARE BECAUSE THE FUNDAMENTAL OPERATIONS INVOLVE ONLY LOGICAL COMPARISONS (MIN AND MAX). THE ADVANTAGES OF THIS APPROACH MAKE IT IDEALLY SUITED FOR PROCESSING LARGE VOLUMES OF SAR AND MULTISPECTRAL DATA AT VERY LOW COMPUTATIONAL COST USING SPECIALIZED HARDWARE OR FINE-GRAINED PARALLEL COMPUTERS. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS ATLANTIC AEROSPACE ELECTRONICS CORPORATION HAS DEVELOPED AND DEMONSTRATED THIS MORPHOLOGY-BASED TECHNOLOGY FOR DETECTING NON-RESOLVED AND RESOLVED TARGETS IN HIGH CLUTTER BACKGROUNDS. THIS WORK WAS ACCOMPLISHED IN SEVERAL PROGRAMS SPONSORED BY THE AIR FORCE, IN WHICH BASIC ALGORITHM COMPONENTS WERE DEVELOPED, ALGORITHM PERFORMANCE WAS QUANTIFIED ANALYTICALLY AND THEIR OPERATION WAS VERIFIED EXPERIMENTALLY USING RECORDED REAL DATA FROM AIRBORNE SAR AND GROUND-BASED DOPPLER RADARS, AS WELL AS PASSIVE ELECTRO-OPTICAL SENSORS. OUR PROPOSAL IS TO EVOLVE THIS EXISTING TECHNOLOGY TO THE POWERLINE DETECTION PROBLEM.

THE SYSTEM LOCATES TARGETS BY CORRELATING THE ACOUSTIC SIGNALS RECEIVED BY SEVERAL PAIRS OF SENSORS TO DETERMINE TIME DIFFERENCE OF ARRIVAL (TDOA).

FROM THE INTRINSIC ASYMMETRY OF WAVELETS, THEY SEEM TO BE WELL-SUITED FOR THE SIMULATION OF HIGHLY ADVECTED PHENOMENA. THIS PROGRAM OF USING WAVELETS FOR NUMERICAL SOLUTIONS OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS WILL BE CARRIED OUT IN SEVERAL PHASES. THE FIRST PHASE WILL CONCERN THE PROBLEM OF ONE AND TWO-DIMENSIONAL SCALAR EQUATIONS, BOTH LINEAR AND NON-LINEAR IN NATURE. THE LATER PHASES WILL INCLUDE VECTOR-VALUED PROBLEMS ARISING IN FLUID DYNAMICS, FIELD THEORY AND FINITE CLASTICITY. MORE SPECIFICALLY IN PHASE I WE SHALL ADDRESS THE SOLUTION OF LINEAR ELLIPTIC BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEMS IN DIMENSION 1 AND 2, INCLUDING SITUATIONS WHERE THE SOLUTION EXHIBITS BOUNDARY LAYERS. WE SHALL ALSO INVESTIGATE THE WAVELET SOLUTION OF LINEAR AND NONLINEAR TIME-DEPENDENT PROBLEMS SUCH AS THE HEAT EQUATION, THE LINEAR ADVECTION EQUATION, THE BUCKLEY-LEVERETT EQUATIONS, AND THE KURAMOTO-SHIVASHINSKY EQUATION. COMPARISON WILL BE MADE WITH MORE CLASSICAL SOLUTION METHODS BASED, FOR INSTANCE, ON FINITE-DIFFERENCE AND FINITE ELEMENT METHODS.

ABILITY OF CIPS TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES WILL BE STUDIED BY AN INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH TEAM FROM OREGONSTATE UNIVERSITY, OREGON GRADUATE CENTER AND USDA HORTICULTURAL CROPS RESEARCH LABORATORY COOPERATING WITH BRIGGS NURSERY STAFF TO : EVALUATE ALTERNATIVE CONSTRUCTIONMATERIALS; EVALUATE EFFECT OF VOLUME HEAT CAPACITY AND INSULATION CHARACTERISTICS ON UNIFORM, VIABLE ROOTZONE TEMPERATURE MAINTENANCE; ESTABLISH STABLE, ROOTZONE CHEMICALAND MOISTURE GRADIENTS AND BENEFICIAL MICROORGANISMS IN UNIQUE ROOTZONE NICHES; EVALUATE PLANT PATHOGEN EPIDEMIOLOGY. IF, THROUGH RESEARCH, HYPOTHESIZED PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ADVANTAGES OF CIPS CAN BE REALIZED, INDUSTRY ADOPTION OF CIPS WOULD DRASTICALLY REDUCE WATER, CHEMICAL, ENERGY INPUTS INTO GREENHOUSE AND NURSERY CROP PRODUCTION AND WOULD ELIMINATE PRODUCTION RELATED POLLUTION. WOULD REDUCE WATER AND FERTILIZER UP TO 80%; ELIMINATE NURSERY OVERWINTERING COSTS (STRUCTURES AND PLANT MOVEMENT);DECREASE GREENHOUSE HEATING COSTS/ENERGY 60% OR MORE; INCREASE RELIABILITY OF ESTABLISHMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF BENEFICIAL BIOLOGICAL ORGANISMS IN ROOT ZONE AND EXPEDITE INTEGRATION OF BIOLOGICAL CONTROLS; FACILITATE MYCORRHIZAE AND OTHER BENEFICIAL MICROORGANISMS IN PRODUCTION SYSTEM TO INCREASE TRANSPLANT SURVIVAL.",

THE PROPOSEDSTUDY WILL MAKE USE OF A NOVEL TECHNIQUE TO VISUALIZE 'INSITU' THE SOLID LIQUID INTERFACE, WHICH WAS RECENTLY DEVELOPED AT BRIMROSE (REF. 3). THIS TECHNIQUE IS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF INFRARED IMAGING. IT USES DIFFERENCE IN EMISSIVITIES OF SOLID AND LIQUID TO OBTAIN DEMARCATION BETWEEN SOLID AND LIQUID. AT THE SAME TIME IT ALSO WORKS INRADIOGRAPHIC MODE DEPENDING UPON THE INFRARED TRANSMISSION RANGE OF THE MATERIAL IN QUESTION. THE MODEL MATERIAL CHOSEN FOR THESE EXPERIMENTS IS NAC1 BECAUSE OF ITS WIDE IR TRANSMISSION RANGE (0.2UM - 26UM) AND VERY WELL UNDERSTOOD PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES. THE INFRARED IMAGING OF THE SOLIDIFICATION PROCESS WILL BE CARRIED OUT USING THE INFRARED IMAGING SYSTEM OPERATING IN THE RANGE OF 3-5UM. THIS TECHNIQUE WILL ALLOW FOR THE FIRST TIME AN 'INSITU' STUDY OF THE EFFECT OF GRAVITY DRIVEN CONVECTION ON THE SOLID-LIQUID INTERFACE. THIS TECHNIQUE IS (1) NON-INTRUSIVE AND NON-DESTRUCTIVE IN NATURE, (2) PERMITS SAFE USE WITHOUT REQUIRING ANY SPECIAL PRECAUTION, AND (3) AMENABLE TO BOTH GROUND BASED EXPERIMENTS AND EXPERIMENTATION IN THE SPACE SHUTTLE.",

PRELIMINARY REQUIREMENTS ON THE NEW DEVICE HAVE BEEN SET. THE DEVICE SHOULD RISE TO ABOUT 4 M ABOVE THE WATERLINE FOR VIEWING OVER WAVES. THE RANGE SHOULD BE GREATER THAN 10 KM. THE PERFORMANCE AT RANGE SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO DETECT AND RECOGNIZE SMALL OBJECTS. THE PERISCOPE SHOULD HAVE A +60 TO -5 DEG FIELD OF REGARD IN ELEVATION AND 360 DEG IN AZIMUTH. A MAXIMUM POSSIBLE FIELD-OF-VIEW (FOV) IS DESIRABLE. DIRECT OPTICS FOVS ARE OPTIMISTIC GOALS FOR IMAGING DEVICES. THE OPTICAL ELEMENT DIAMETER, D, HAS DIRECT BEARING ON THE PERFORMANCE. THE LARGER D, THE LARGER EFFECTIVE RANGE. HOWEVER, OBSERVABILITY, SIZE, AND COST OF THE PACKAGE ALSO GROW WITHD. AFTER RELEASE FROM A STORAGE TRUNK, THE DEVICE (PROPORTIONED LIKE A TORPEDO) SWIMS TO A REMOTE STATION JUST UNDER THE SURFACE, FAR FROM THE SUBMARINE. HERE, THE AFT PORTION IS FLOODED, CAUSING A ROTATION TO VERTICAL. THE FORWARD PART IS THEN RAISED IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO THAT OF A CONVENTIONAL PERISCOPE. TWO STABILIZATION SYSTEMS WILL BE USED. THE FIRST (COARSE) SYSTEM WILL KEEP THE DEVICE VERTICAL AND WILL HOLD STATION AGAINST SURFACE SURRENTS. THE FINE SYSTEM WILL STABILIZE THE LINE-OF-SIGHT (LOS) TO A TARGET BY MOVING A MIRROR IN THE PERISCOPE HEAD. THE FINE SYSTEM WILL MOVE THE MIRROR IN PITCH AND YAW. ROLL ABOUT THE LOS WILL BE STABILIZED ELECTRONICALLY.",

SECOND, MULTILEVEL ADAPTIVE SCHEMES WOULD PROVIDE THE ABILITY TO EFFICIENTLY GENERATE REFINED BUT SMOOTH LOCAL PATCHES FOR INCREASING RESOLUTION AND ACCURACY AT BODY SURFACES, SINGULAR AND STAGNATION POINTS, SHOCKS, AND OTHER PHENOMENA.

DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF DAMPING TREATMENTS INDICATE THAT TUNED-MASS DAMPERS ARE MORE FEASIBLE FOR AIRCRAFT AERODYNAMIC SURFACE VIBRATION PROBLEMS THAN OTHER TYPES OF DAMPERS.

VIDEO AND RADAR SENSOR SYSTEMS SUPPORT TRACKING. ACCURATE, REAL TIME TRACKING IS CRITICAL IN SUPPORTING RANGE SAFETY CALCULATIONS AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION. CURRENTLY OBJECTS ARE TRACKED USING POLYNOMIAL FILTERS (E.G. ALPHA-BETA FILTERS). POLYNOMIAL MODELS ARE USED BECAUSE THEY: ARE EASY TO CONSTRUCT, ARE COMPUTATIONALLY EFFICIENT, AND DO NOT REQUIRE DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF THE TARGET'S DYNAMICS. THE PRICE OF THIS SIMPLICITY IS THAT THEY RELY ON THE DATA TO CONTINUALLY CORRECT THE STATE ESTIMATE FOR UNMODELED EFFECTS. SINCE POLYNOMIAL FILTERS IGNORE SIGNIFICANT (AND KNOWN) DYNAMICS, THEY MUST BE MADE MORE RESPONSIVE TO CURRENT DATA (I.E. USE LARGER FILTER GAINS) THAN FILTERS BASED ON MORE ACCURATE MODELS. POLYNOMIAL FILTERS WILL BE CORRESPONDINGLY MORE RESPONSIVE TO NOISE IN THE DATA AS WELL. WE PROPOSE, IN PHASE I, TO IDENTIFY A LIMITED NUMBER OF GENERAL PURPOSE MOTION MODELS, BASED ON STOCHASTIC, DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS. WE WILL BUILD A SYSTEM FOR RAPIDLY SELECTING AND IMPLEMENTING FILTERS BASED ON THESE MODELS.

THE MOST PROMISING APPROACH TO MAKING A VELOCITY MEASUREMENT INVOLVES THE PRECISE MEASUREMENT OF A DOPPLER SHIFTED MOLECULAR ABSORPTION OR FLUORESCENCE SIGNAL AND RELATING THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SHIFT TO THE CARRIER FLOW VELOCITY. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLE TO THIS APPROACH IS IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE SMALL SPECTRAL SHIFT TO AN ACCURACY SUFFICIENT TO BE USEFUL. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A RESONANCE FLUORESCENCE - DOPPLER SHIFT APPROACH WHICH CAN PROVIDE TWO DIMENSIONAL VELOCITY AND DENSITY DATA WITH KHZ DATA RATES. IN OUR APPROACH THE FREQUENCY PRECISIION IS PROVIDED BY A NARROWBAND CONTINUOUS DYE LASER WHICH IS FREQUENCY MODULATED OVER A SMALL RANGE (NEAR A MOLECULAR ABSORPTION). THE FREQUENCY MODULATION TECHNIQUE TO BE USED HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AND DEMONSTRATED AT KHZ CYCLE RATES. THE LASER BEAM IS PASSED THROUGH A REFERENCE CELL CONTAINING THE MOLECULAR SPECIES TO BE PROBED AND IS THEN PASSED THROUGH THE EXHAUST FLOW TO BE DETERMINED. SINCE THE DOPPLER SHIFTED MOLECULES IN THE HIGH SPEED FLOW WILL BE EXCITED AND FLUORESCENCE AT A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FREQUENCY FROM THOSE IN THE REFERENCE CELL, THE TWO FLUORESCENCE SIGNALS WILL OCCUR AT DIFFERENT TIMES IN THE LASER MODULATION CYCLE. BY MEASURING THE TIME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE SIGNALS THE DOPPLER SHIFT CAN BE DETERMINED WITH GREAT PRECISION. THE MAGNITUDE OF THE RAYLEIGH SCATTER FROM THE OBSERVATION POINT, WHICH IS CONSTANT WITH LASER FREQUENCY, CAN BE MONITORED AND USED TO DETERMINE THE GAS DENSITY AS WELL.

A REPEATER WILL BE DEVELOPED USING CURRENT LOW-COST TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL SIMULTANEOUSLY REPEAT THREE COMMUNICATION CHANNELS, TWO 25 KHZ AM VOICE AND ONE 25 KHZ FM DATA CHANNEL. THE REPEATER USES AN IF REPEATER ARCHITECTURE, WITH THREE INDEPENDENT CHANNELS, EACH FREQUENCY SELECTED BY A PROGRAMMABLE SYNTHESIZER. THE THREE CHANNELS ARE TRANSLATED BY A CONSTANT FREQUENCY SHIFT, AND SUMMED TOGETHER. THE COMPOSITE SIGNAL IS AMPLIFIED BY A LINEAR AMPLIFIER TO 5 WATTS PER CHANNEL AND RETRANSMITTED. A DIPLEXER SEPARATES THE RECEIVE AND TRANSMIT BANDS TO ALLOW A COMMON ANTENNA. THE REPEATER WILL OPERATE FOR 12 HOURS WITH 50% DUTY CYCLE. THE REPEATER USES RECENTLY DEVELOPED LOW-POWER RF AND IF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS, HIGH ENERGY BATTERIES, AND LOW COST MINIATURE PACKAGING TECHNIQUES TO PROVIDE THE ENTIRE ELECTRONICS WITH BATTERIES IN A SIX POUND PACKAGE SUITABLE FOR BALLOONS.

THE DIAMOND ELECTRONIC DEVICE MOST LIKELY TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED T/R SWITCH SPECIFICATIONS IS AN INSULATED GATE FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTOR (IGFET) OPERATED AS A SWITCHING POWER TRANSISTOR. DIAMOND MATERIALS, INC. (DMI), PLANS TO DEVELOP A DIAMOND IGFET T/R SWITCH IN TWO PHASES. IN PHASE I, DMI WILL EVALUATE CUBIC BORON NITRIDE (C-BN) THIN FILMS AS A SUITABLE GATE DIELECTRIC FOR DIAMOND IGFETS. THE PROPERTIES OF THE GATE DIELECTRIC ARE CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THE DIAMOND IGFET, AND DMI BELIEVES THAT C-BN SHOULD BE THE BEST GATE DIELECTRIC MATERIAL. DMI WILL DEPOSIT C-BN FILMS ON P-TYPE, EPITAXIAL DIAMOND MONOCRYSTALS, AND WILL EVALUATE THE ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES OF THE C-BN/DIAMOND INTERFACE. THE C-BN FILMS WILL BE DEPOSITED USING A PROPRIETARY PROCESS UNDER DEVELOPMENT AT DMI. IF THE ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES OF C-BN ON DIAMOND ARE ACCEPTABLE, THEN DMI WILL PROPOSE A PHASE II PROGRAM TO DEVELOP DIAMOND IGFETS (WITH C-BN GATE DIELECTRICS) AS T/R SWITCHES. PHASE II WILL STRIVE TO DEVELOP DIAMOND T/R SWITCHES WHICH MEET THE POWER, FREQUENCY, VOLTAGE, AND SWITCHING TIME SPECIFICATIONS DESIRED BY THE AIR FORCE. THE P-CHANNEL IGFET HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS THE MOST PRACTICAL TRANSISTOR ARCHITECTURE FOR DIAMOND BECAUSE ITS PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS SHOULD BE REASONABLY CONSTANT OVER A WIDE TEMPERATURE RANGE, AND BECAUSE IT SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO TRANSMIT HIGH FREQUENCY SIGNALS.",

FRICTIONAL PROPERTIES ARE USUALLY PROVIDED USING STACKED TEFLON-COATED STEEL PLATES, WHILE FLEXIBILITY IS PROVIDED BY ELASTOMERIC RUBBER PADS. A NEW BASE ISOLATION SYSTEM COMPRISED OF ALTERNATE GEOSYNTHETIC LINERS AND SOIL LAYERS IS PROPOSED TO BE EVALUATED AND IMPLEMENTED. GEOMEMBRANE AND GEOTEXTILE GEOSYNTHETICS TYPICALLY HAVE VERY LOW FRICTION COEFFICIENTS. A LAYERED GEOTEXTILE/GEOMEMBRANE-SOIL SYSTEM PROVIDES A PRACTICAL, LOW-COST, AND SIMPLE-TO-INSTALL BASE ISOLATION SYSTEM THROUGH LOW FRICTIONAL PROPERTIES OF GEOSYNTHETICS AND THE FLEXBILITY OF A SOIL LAYER. LATERAL DEFLECTION OF STRUCTURES MAY BE LIMITED BY HYSTERETIC DAMPING OF THE SOIL LAYER AND BY SOFT BACKFILL MATERIALS AROUND THE BUILDING BASEMENT. THE EXPERIMENTAL AND ANALYTICAL STUDIES PROPOSED WILL VERIFY THE EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM.",

THIS TECHNIQUE UTILIZES ESTABLISHED TECHNOLOGIES OF MICRO-MACHINING AND MICROELECTRONIC PROCESSING OF SILICON (SI) WAFERS FOR FABRICATING MONOLITHIC ARRAYS OF LWIR DETECTORS. THE DETECTOR ELEMENTS OF THE ARRAY ARE FORMED BY AN ULTRA-THIN FILM OF A BOLOMETER MATERIAL PROCESSING THE HIGHEST TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENT OF RESISTANCE KNOWN, AND THE READOUT ELECTRONIC MICROCIRCUIT IS FABRICATED ON THE SAME SILICON CHIP NEXT TO THE ELEMENTS. THE RESULTANT DETECTOR ARRAYS WILL POSSESS FEATURES OF LOW COST, LOW WEIGHT, HIGH RESPONSIVITY AND HIGH SENSITIVITY. THE LOW COST IS DUE TO A SINGLE BATCH PROCESS IN THE ARRAY FABRICATION. THE LOW WEIGHT IS DUE TO A MONOLITHIC ARRAY STRUCTURE REQUIRING NO COOLING. THE HIGH RESPONSIVITY IS DUE TO A LARGE TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENT OF RESISTIVITY (>15% COMPARED TO 0.2% FOR A CONVENTIONAL BOLOMETER) OF OUR NEW BOLOMETER MATERIAL. THE HIGH SENSITIVITY IS DUE TO THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF HIGH RESPONSIVITY, LOW NOISE AND HIGH THERMAL ISOLATION OF THE BOLOMETER FROM ITS SURROUNDINGS.",

A NEW ENABLING TECHNOLOGY CALLED ACOUSTIC CHARGE TRANSPORT (ACT) HAS GIVEN RISE TO A FAMILY OF PROGRAMMABLE FILTERS THAT HOLD PROMISE FOR REDUCING THIS INTERFERENCE PROBLEM. THE PROGRAMMING TIME FOR THESE MINIATURE FILTERS IS LESS THAN 100 USECS, THE TECHNOLOGY EXISTS TO PROGRAM THE CENTER FREQUENCY ACROSS THE 225 TO 400 MHZ BAND AND THE BANDWIDTH IS PROGRAMMABLE TO VALUES LESS THAN 25 KHZ. THE STANDOFF DYNAMIC RANGE OF ACT PROGRAMMABLE FILTERS IS IN THE 85 TO 95 DB RANGE FOR THE 25 KHZ CHANNELS. THIS DYNAMIC RANGE IS INADEQUATE FOR THE VERY DEMANDING CO-SITE REQUIREMENTS. THIS PROGRAM WILL UPGRADE THE PRESENT FILTERS WITH A PROGRAMMABLE MATCHING NETWORK AT THE INPUT IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE STANDOFF DYNAMIC RANGE AND SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASE THE NOISE FIGURE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO PRODUCE A PROGRAMMABLE FILTER IN A SMALL MODULE THAT CAN BE ADDED TO PRESENT FH RADIOS TO ALLOW THEM TO MEET THE CO-SITE REQUIREMENTS.

RATHER THAN THE USUAL STORED REFERENCE APPROACHES THAT EXHIBIT EITHER LONG ACQUISITION AND SYNCHRONIZATION CYCLES OR LIMITED PROCESSING GAIN AND JAMMING MARGIN, THE APPROACH USES A TRANSMITTED REFERENCE CONFIGURATION IN WHICH THE PROCESSING GAIN IS SET BY THE PRODUCT OF THE TRANSMITTED BANDWIDTH AND THE INTEGRATION TIME. THE PROCESSOR CONFIGURATION FEATURES VIRTUALLY UNLIMITED PROCESSING GAIN POTENTIAL, LOW DETECTABILITY, AND EXCELLENT JAMMING MARGINS TO NOISE AND PULSE SIGNALS. THIS CONFIGURATION HAS NOT BEEN EXPLOITED IN THE PAST PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF ITS PARTICULAR SUSCEPTIBILITY TO CW JAMMING.

THE HIGH EFFICIENCY DERIVES PRIMARILY FROM THE FACTS THAT THE CCSSHT SYSTEM (1) RECOVERS THE SPENT SAND HEAT TO PREHEAT THE FEED ORE, (2) THOROUGHLY BURNS AND USES THE COKE ENERGY AND (3) OPERATES WITHOUT USING HOT RECYCLE SAND AS A HEAT CARRIER. THE LATTER FEATURE IS DOUBLY IMPORTANT, CONTRIBUTING TO HIGH OILYIELD AND TO THE GENERATION OF REACTIVE COKE WHICH CAN BE THOROUGHLY BURNED BELOW 1000F WHEN CARBONATE MINERALS ARE PRESENT, TO AVOID ENDOTHERMAL CALCINATION OF THE CARBONATES. THE ROTARY RETORT ACHIEVES THE MULTI-OPERATION PROCESS IN A SINGLE VESSEL WHICH CUTS 70% OFF THE OPERATION AND EQUIPMENT COSTS OF SOME LESS EFFICIENT PROCESSES. THE CCSSHT RETORT HELPS TO MITIGATE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS IN SEVEN IMPORTANT AREAS. THESE ARE (1) 80% REDUCED ATMOSPHERIC CONTAMINATING COMBUSTION PRODUCTS, (2) VIRTUAL ELIMINATION OF CARBONATE CALCINATION CO2 (AN ATMOSPHERE CONTAMINANT) AND (3) ASH THAT IS THOROUGHLY CLEANED OF COKE,(4) THAT HAS LOW ALKALI CONTENT, (5) THAT HAS RELATIVELY COARSE PARTICLE SIZE AND (6) IS COOL WHEN EJECTED TO THE ENVIRONMENT. FINALLY, (7) SINCE SOLID-TO-SOLID HEAT TRANSFER USES NO WATER, CCSSHT WILL ALSO CONSERVE WATER. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROPOSED PHASE I PROJECT IS TO OBTAIN DATA FOR THE DESIGN AND OPERATION OF ONE PART OF THE CCSSHT PROCESS DEVELOPMENT KILN, THE GAS LOCK, AND TO DEMONSTRATE THE GAS LOCK FUNCTIONALITY WITH A COLD FLOW STUDY IN A SMALLPLASTIC ROTARY VESSEL.

        "abstract": "THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEFINE THE OPTIMAL PARAMETERS FOR AN ENZYMATICALLY CONTROLLED POLYMERIC INSULINDELIVERY SYSTEM. IN THIS SYSTEM, GLUCOSE OXIDASE IS IMMOBILIZED TO SEPHAROSE BEADS OR TO THE POLYMER BACKBONE OF THE INSULIN DELIVERY MATRIX. LYOPHILIZED INSULIN IS INCORPORATED INTO THE POLYMER MATRIX. THE RELEASE OF INSULIN IS CONTROLLED BY ITS DISSOLUTION AND DIFFUSION RATE. PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTS HAVE SHOWN THAT INCREASING THE INSULIN DISSOLUTION RATE RESULTS IN AN INCREASED INSULIN RELEASE RATE FROM THE MATRIX. THIS CHANGE IN INSULIN DISSOLUTION RATE CAN BE CONTROLLED BY ALTERING THE PH OF THEMICROENVIRONMENT OF THE MATRIX. THIS PH CHANGE CAN BE MEDIATED BY THE CONVERSION OF GLUCOSE TO GLUCONIC ACID BY THE IMMOBILIZED GLUCOSE OXIDASE. WHEN GLUCOSE CONCENTRATIONS RISE, THE ENZYME CATALYZES THE PRODUCTION OF GLUCONIC ACID AND LOWERS THE MICROENVIRONMENTAL PH OF THE MATRIX. THE LOWER PH RESULTS IN INCREASED INSULIN DISSOLUTION AND DIFFUSION FROM THE SYSTEM IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN GLUCOSE CONCENTRATION. THE ADVANTAGES TO THE DIABETIC OF AN INSULIN DELIVERY SYSTEMTHAT MORE CLOSELY MIMICS PHYSIOLOGIC INSULIN DELIVERY INCLUDE IMPROVED PATIENT COMPLIANCE AND IMPROVED SHORT- AND LONG-TERM THERAPY. THIS ENZYME-MEDIATED, FEEDBACK-CONTROLLED DELIVERY SYSTEM COULD BE APPLIED TO THE NUMEROUS NEW THERAPEUTIC PROTEINS NOW BEING DEVELOPED.",

THE CURRENTPROPOSAL IS DIRECTED TOWARDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A GENETICALLY MODIFIED STRAIN THAT EXPRESSES A BACTERIAL HEMOGLOBIN-LIKE PROTEIN. THIS PROTEIN WAS ORIGINALLY DISCOVERED IN THE AEROBIC BACTERIA VITREOSCILLA, AND APPARENTLY ENABLES THE CELLS TO SURVIVE IN AN OXYGEN-POOR ENVIRONMENT. WHEN VITREOSCILLA HEMOGLOBIN WAS EXPRESSED IN THE BACTERIA ESCHERICHIA COLI, THE RECOMBINANT CELLS DEMONSTRATED HIGHER GROWTH AND RESPIRATION RATES, AND GREW TO HIGHER CELL DENSITIES. THE GENE ENCODING THIS PROTEIN WILL BE INTRODUCED INTO STREPTOMYCES COELICOLOR, WHICH PRODUCES THE ANTIBIOTIC ACTINORHODIN. THE RECOMBINANT CELLSWILL THEN BE TESTED FOR THEIR GROWTH AND RESPIRATORY PROPERTIES, AND ACTINORHODIN PRODUCTION. THE DEMONSTRATION OF ENHANCED GROWTH, RESPIRATION, AND/OR ACTINORHODIN YIELDS IN THIS SYSTEM WILL HAVE BROAD IMPLICATIONS NOT ONLY FOR ANTIBIOTIC FERMENTATIONS BUT FOR ANY BIOPROCESS SYSTEM THAT INVOLVES AEROBIC CELL CULTURE.",

        "abstract": "THIS PROJECT IS AN EXPLORATION OF THE APPLICATION OF KNOWLEDGE BASED TOOLS TO SCALABLE MILITARY CAMPAIGN SIMULATIONS. THE APPROACH TO BE TAKEN IS TO DEVELOP A GENERALIZED FRAME BASED KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION SYSTEM WITH A COMBINATION OF ACTIVE AND STATIC SLOT VALUES TO REPRESENT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF EACH LEVEL OF THE FORCE HIERARCHY. ACTIVE VALUES IN THE SYSTEM MAY CONSIST OF DATA BASE QUERIES, PROCEDURAL (DETERMINISTIC) PROGRAM CALLS, OR NON-PROCEDURAL (INFERENCE ENGINE) CALLS. AGGREGATION IS ACCOMODATED THROUGH ALGORITHMS CALLED BY THE ACTIVE VALUE SLOTS OF THE FRAME. OPPOSING FORCE ACTIVITIES ARE SIMILARLY SIMULATED FOR PLAY AGAINST THE COMPUTER. PROGRAMMING A SIMULATION IS TABLE DRIVEN AND WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY CHANGING THE SLOT VALUES IN THE CONTROLLING FRAME(S) OF THE INSTANTIATION. SYSTEM PERFORMANCE IS BROUGHT TO FASTER THAN REAL TIME BY USING A MODIFICATION OF A PROPRIETARY, SCALABLE, DISTRIBUTED, PARALLEL-PROCESSING SYSTEM RUNNING ON A NETWORK OF PERSONAL COMPUTERS. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - THE KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION SCHEME TO BE DEVELOPED SHOULD BE OF VALUE FOR ANY HIERARCHICALLY ORIENTED SIMULATION (ESPECIALLY FOR MILITARY, BUSINESS, OR GOVERNMENTAL UNIT INTERACTIONS). THE MODIFIED PARALLEL PROCESSING SYSTEM WILL MAKE POSSIBLE MUCH CHEAPER AND MORE ROBUST SCALABLE, FAULT-TOLERANT COMPUTING SYSEMS.

RECENTLY, NASA HAS SHOWN THAT WINDS OF EQUAL ACCURACY AND RESOLUTION AS THOSE OBTAINED BY A JIMSPHERE CAN BE OBTAINED WITH AN INSTRUMENTED AIRCRAFT IN APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES. HOWEVER, THE INITIAL CAPITAL INVESTMENT FOR A DEDICATED AIRCRAFT AND ITS OPERATION COSTS ARE LARGE.

A SMALL INSTRUMENTED ROCKET CAN BE DIRECTED SPECIFICALLY ALONG THE SHUTTLE LAUNCH PATH AND TELEMETRY WINDSPEEDS WELL WITHIN THE 10 MINUTE TIME FRAME.

THE INNOVATIVE CONCEPT PROPOSED IS TO FOCUS THE ARRAY IN THE NEAR FIELD BY THE FRESNEL TRANSFORM APPROXIMATION TO, IN EFFECT, MAKE PLANAR THE SPHERICAL WAVEFRONTS FROM NEAR-FIELD JAMMERS, SO THAT THEY APPEAR TO BE LOCATED IN THE FAR-FIELD WHEN THE ARRAY IS FOCUSED AT THE NEAR-FIELD RANGE OF THE JAMMERS. THE CONCEPT HAS THE POTENTIAL OF PROVIDING A HIGHLY ACCURATE AND EFFICIENT NEAR-FIELD MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUE FOR ADAPTIVE ARRAYS AT VERY LOW COST. IN ADDITION, THE CONCEPT ELIMINATES THE TRANSFORMATIONS GENERALLY NECESSARY TO OBTAIN THE FAR-FIELD PATTERN FROM NEAR-FIELD MEASUREMENTS. THE REQUIREMENTS FOR PROBE PATTERN COMPENSATION AND HIGH PROBE POSITION ACCURACY ARE OBVIATED SINCE THE FAR-FIELD PATTERN IS MEASURED DIRECTLY IN THE NEAR FIELD.",

FOR FREQUENCIES BELOW 1 GHZ, SURFACE ACOUSTIC WAVE (SAW) AND BULK ACOUSTIC WAVE (BAW) TECHNOLOGIES HAVE PROVIDED EXCELLENT MONOLITHIC IMPLEMENTATIONS OF THESE TWO FUNCTIONS. THE PROPOSED PROGRAM WILL EXTEND THE FREQUENCY RANGE OF THESE ACOUSTIC TECHNOLOGIES BY A FACTOR OF 10 THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INNOVATIVE NEW CLASS OF ACOUSTIC PROPAGATION MODES WHICH HAVE PHASE VELOCITIES THAT ARE UP TO 10 TIMES LARGER THAN CONVENTIONAL ACOUSTIC WAVE VELOCITIES. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS EFFORT WOULD MAKE A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH FOR MICROWAVE FILTER AND RESONATOR TECHNOLOGY.",

CONVENTIONAL TECHNOLOGY DOES NOT EASILY ALLOW THE EXTRACTION OR DISTILLATION OF THE KNOWLEDGE CONTAINED WITHIN THESE DATABASES. AS A CONSEQUENCE, MOST OF THE TRUE POWER OF THIS INFORMATION IS INEFFICIENTLY UTILIZED. HNC HAS DEVELOPED THE ABILITY TO CHARACTERIZE, EXTRACT, AND EXPLOIT KNOWLEDGE CONTAINED WITHIN DATABASES USING NEURAL NETWORK TECHNIQUES. THIS CAPABILITY HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED ON COMMERCIAL SECTOR DATABASES, AND IS CALLED \"KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION USING NEURAL NETWORKS\" (KENN). KENN CAN DISCOVER UNKNOWN RELATIONSHIPS CONTAINED WITHIN DATABASES, AND CAN DEVELOP COMPLEX NON-LINEAR MODELS OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS WITH NO PROGRAMMING AND MINIMAL USER INTERACTION. KENN IS EXTREMELY POWERFUL AND MAJOR PORTIONS OF THE TECHNOLOGY EXIST. HOWEVER, THE MOST POWERFUL COMPONENT OF KENN, RELATIONSHIP DISCOVERY, HAS ONLY BEEN DEMONSTRATED ON A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT BASIS. THIS PROPOSAL DESCRIBES THE EXISTING KENN TECHNOLOGY AND OFFERS A PLAN FOR THE ENHANCEMENT OF THE RELATIONSHIP DISCOVERY COMPONENT OF KENN WITH SPECIFIC EMPHASIS TO ARMY EXECUTIVE INFORMATION SYTEM (EIS) PROCESSING REQUIREMENTS.

SOLID-LIQUID PHASE CHANGES IN HIGHLY CORROSIVE SALTS, SUCH AS LIF, ARE FAR FROM IDEAL FOR SUPPLYING THE THERMAL DEMANDS OF DYNAMIC POWER CONVERTERS.

METAL HYDRIDES ARE COMPETITIVE WITH MOLTEN SALTS IN TERMS OF WEIGHT AND SUPERIOR IN TERMS OF HEAT STORED PER UNIT OF VOLUME. THE MOST IMPORTANT ADVANTAGE OF HYDRIDES IS THEIR ABILITY TO RETURN HEAT TO THE RECEIVER OF A DYNAMIC CONVERTER WITHOUT A REDUCTION IN TEMPERATURE. THIS EFFECT MAY BE ACHIEVED BY DEVELOPING PAIRS OF METAL HYDRIDES, OPERATING INTANDEM TO PUMP WASTE HEAT FROM THE RADIATOR LOOP TO THE RECEIVER. A TEMPERATURE SWING IN ONE OF THE TWO HYDRIDES OVERCOMES THE IRREVERSIBLE ENERGY LOSSES OF STORING AND RECOVERING HEAT FROM THE OTHER.

FURTHERMORE, IT IS ESTIMATED THAT 300,000 OR MORE DENTAL IMPLANTS WILL BE USED IN THE UNITED STATES BY 1992. OSSEOINTEGRATION, PARTICULARLY IN TWO-STAGE ROOT-FORM IMPLANTS, HAS BEEN SHOWN TO RESULT IN EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE OF DENTAL IMPLANTS. HOWEVER, ACHIEVING OSSEOINTEGRATION OFTEN REQUIRES EXTENSIVE PERIODS OF TIME (1 YEAR) WITH THE IMPLANT OUT OF FUNCTION. WITH EARLY FUNCTIONAL RESTORATION,OSSEOINTEGRATION IS OFTEN NEVER ACHIEVED. THE LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK IS TO DEVELOP A NONINVASIVE TREATMENT MODALITY THAT CAN BE USED TO ENHANCE OSSEOINTEGRATION BY EITHER REDUCING THE TIME TO ACHIEVE IT OR BY PROVIDING PREDICTABLE BONE AUGMENTATION. THE AIM OF THIS PHASE I STUDY IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF UTILIZING RESONANT ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS TO STIMULATE OSTEOGENESIS AND THEREBY ENHANCE DENTAL IMPLANT OSSEOINTEGRATION. USING A CANINE TRANSCORTICAL MODEL, ANIMALS WILL BE PLACED IN ALIGNED STATIC AND TIME-VARYING MAGNETIC FIELDS FOR PERIODS OF 3 AND 6 WEEKS. CONDITIONS ON THE FIELD WILL BE SET TO STIMULATE THE TRANSPORT ACROSS CELL MEMBRANES OF SPECIFIC IONS. THE OSSEOINTEGRATION POTENTIAL OF THE RESONANT ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD TREATMENT WILL BE STUDIED, UTILIZING ATTACHMENT STRENGTH AND HISTOLOGY OF THE INTERFACEIN THE TREATED LIMBS AS COMPARED TO THE UNTREATED CONTROL LIMBS.",

THE PEPTIDE, TERMED A25D, REPRESENTS AN 18-AMINO ACID SEQUENCE FROM THE PUTATIVE CD4 ATTACHMENT SITE ON GP120, AND BIOPHYSICAL COMPARISONS SUGGEST THAT IT CONTAINS BOTH B- AND T-CELL EPITOPES.

ONE USES A LOW PRESSURE RADIAL OUTFLOW AIR TURBINE TO DRIVE A HIGH SPEED IRONLESS DC GENERATOR AND THE OTHER USES A HIGH PRESSURE AIR TURBINE TO DRIVE AN AXIAL GAP, 3 PHASE AC GENERATOR.

THE MMAE APPROACH PROVIDES FILTER ROBUSTNESS IN SYSTEMS WITH UNCERTAIN MODEL PARAMETERS OR PARAMETER CHANGES, TYPICALLY RELATED TO SOURCES OF PROCESS NOISE OR MEASUREMENT NOISE. HOWEVER, WITH CONVENTIONAL KALMAN FILTERS, THIS APPROACH IS IMPRACTICAL WHEN MORE THAN TWO OR THREE UNCERTAIN PARAMETERS EXIST. THE DKF METHOD PERMITS A LARGE, MULTI-SENSOR FILTER TO BE PARTITIONED INTO A SET OF SMALLER LOCAL FILTERS OPERATINGIN PARALLEDL, PLUS A MASTER FILTER PERIODICALLY COMBINING THE LOCAL FILTER SOLUTIONS. THE DKF METHOD PROVIDES OPTIMAL OR NEAR-OPTIMAL ACCURACY, REDUCE PROCESSING BURDEN, AND IMPROVE FAULT TOLERANCE. THE DKF/MMAE (DMAE) TECHNIQUES DEVELOPED HERE WILL ALLOW A LARGE NUMBER OF UNCERTAIN SENSOR PARAMETERS TO BE ACCOMMODATED, VIA LOCAL ADAPTATION OF MULTIPLE LOCAL MODELS, PLUS GLOBAL ADAPTATION AT THE MASTER LEVEL.

WITH THE ADVENT OF Z-PLANE FPA ARCHITECTURES, THE ELECTRONICS CIRCUIT AREA NOW EXISTS TO PROVIDE PROGRAMMABLE ANALOG AND DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSINGCHANNELS FOR EACH ELEMENT OF A TWO-DIMENSIONAL DETECTOR ARRAY. EXPLOITING THIS, IRVINE SENSORS CORPORATION (ISC) HAS CONCEIVED AN INNOVATIVE CIRCUIT CONCEPT THAT, WHEN DEVELOPED, WILL BE GENERIC TO SENSORS AS DIVERSE AS HIGH RESOLUTION VISIBLE AND INFRARED IMAGERS, SPECTROMETERS, AND LIGHTNING MAPPERS. THE CIRCUIT WILL PROVIDE ON-BOARD CALIBRATION, DATA COMPRESSION, IMAGE MOTION COMPENSATION, AND BACKGROUND SUPPRESSION, WHILE MAINTAINING LOW NOISE, HIGH DYNAMIC RANGE AND LOW POWER DISSIPATION. ISC PROPOSES TO PERFORM A CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION DURING PHASE I AND TO DESIGN, FABRICATE, AND TEST A Z-PLANE COMPATIBLE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT DURING PHASE II.",

DEMODULATION IS PERFORMED VIA DIRECT DETECTION OF THE RECEIVED BEAM FOR MANY SHORT-DISTANT COMMUNICATIONS. A LIMITATION ON THIS TECHNIQUE IS THE LINEARITY OF THE DIRECT MODULATION. THAT IS, THE AMPLITUDE OF THE OPTICAL CARRIER DOES NOT CORRESPOND TO THE AMPLITUDE OF THE INPUT RF IN A LINEAR FASHION. THIS NONLINEARITY CAN CAUSE DISTORTIONS, ESPECIALLY WHEN MANY CHANNELS ARE MULTIPLEXED IN THE RF PRIOR TO MODULATION. ONE METHOD TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM IS A LASER DIODE DEVELOPMENT EFFORT TO CREATE DIODES WITH THE APPROPRIATE LINEARITY (1 PART IN 10,000). THIS, HOWEVER, CAN BE VERY COSTLY AND CAN DELAY THIS COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY FROM FUTURE DEVELOPMENT. A MORE COST-EFFECTIVE CORRECTION IS TO USE PRESENT TECHNOLOGY IN DIODE DEVELOPMENT AND CREATE THE NECESSARY LINEARITY THROUGH ELECTRONIC FEEDBACK. SCIENCE, INC. PROPOSES THIS APPROACH, BASED ON TECHNOLOGY RELATED TO THE STABILITY OF LASER POWER OUTPUT. THIS PROPOSAL DISCUSSES A NOVEL METHOD WHEREBY COMMERCIALLY-AVAILABLE ELECTRO-OPTIC COMPONENTS CAN BE PACKAGED TO PRODUCE THE EFFECTS OF A LASER DIODE WITH OUTPUT LINEARITY OF 1 PART IN 10,000 AND A BANDWIDTH OF 10 MHZ. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - APPROPRIATE ELECTRO-OPTIC TECHNOLOGY ALONG WITH ELECTRONIC FEEDBACK OR FEEDFORWARD NETWORKS CAN PRODUCE THE APPROPRIATE MODULATION LINEARITY WITHOUT THE NEED FOR EXPENSIVE LASER DIODE DEVELOPMENT WORK.

THE SENSOR WOULD BE USED TO MEASURE (1) BLOOD OR TISSUE TEMPERATURE; (2) BLOOD PRESSURE; AND (3) LOCAL HEAT FLOW, AIR FLOW, OR BLOOD FLOW FOR VARIOUS CLINICAL APPLICATIONS. IN THIS PROJECT, HOWEVER, THE TARGETAPPLICATION IS ANGIOPLASTY. BECAUSE THE TEMPERATURE- AND FLOW-SENSING COMBINATION HAS ALREADY BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN EARLIER STUDIES, THIS PHASE I RESEARCH WILL CONCENTRATE ON THE COMBINATION OF TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE SENSING. IN PHASE II, THE PROVEN BLOOD-FLOW MEASUREMENT CAPABILITY WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO THE SYSTEM, FORMING A FINAL SENSOR THAT IS CAPABLE OF MEASURING ALL THREE PARAMETERS SIMULTANEOUSLY. A SUCCESSFUL PHASE I PROGRAM WILL PRODUCE PROTOTYPES MADE WITH A SINGLE OPTICAL FIBER CARRYING BOTH THE TEMPERATURE- AND PRESSURE-SENSING ELEMENTS. THE RESULTING PROBE WILL HAVE A MAXIMUM DIAMETER OF 1 MM, WITH POTENTIAL FOR FURTHER SIZE REDUCTION TO 0.5 MM.

THE PROCESS INVOLVES ILLUMINATION OF AN AQUEOUS SOLUTION CONTAINING PYRROLE AND AN ELECTRON ACCEPTOR WITH ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT. ABSORPTIONOF THE LIGHT INDUCES ELECTRON TRANSFER FROM THE PYRROLE TO THE ELECTRON ACCEPTOR, THEREBY PROMOTING POLYMERIZATION OF THE OXIDIZED PYRROLE MONOMER. THE RESULTANT POLYMER IS AHIGHLY CONDUCTING FILM WHICH ADHERES STRONGLY TO THE SUBSTRATE.

SINCE THE PRODUCT GAS DOES NOT MIX WITH THE COMBUSTION FLUE,THE PRODUCT GAS IS OF HIGH QUALITY CONTAINING ESSENTIALLY COAND H2. THIS SYNTHESIS GAS IS IDEAL FOR USE WITH \"INDIRECT LIQUEFACTION\" PROCESSES OR AS A SOURCE OF CHEMICAL FEEDSTOCK. THE MTCI PROCESS OVERCOMES THE PRESENT LIMITATIONS OF INDIRECT GASIFICATION PROCESSES, REDUCING REQUIREMENTS FOR LARGE HEAT TRANSFER AREAS AND/OR LOW THROUGHPUT CAPACITY DUE TO LOW HEAT TRANSFER RATES IN CONVENTIONAL STATE-OF-THE-ART HEAT EXCHANGE TECHNOLOGY. THIS PROJECT ADDRESSES THE USE OF A FLUIDIZED BED CAPABLE OFACHIEVING RAPID INDIRECT HEATING WITH HIGH HEAT TRANSFER RATES TO DEVELOP A PROCESS FOR PRODUCING SYNTHESIS GAS FROM LOW-RANK COALS. THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES A SIMPLIFIED PROCESS AND REACTOR DESIGN FOR PROCESSING THE UNDERUTILIZED AND INEXPENSIVE LOW-RANK COAL RESOURCE INTO HIGH-QUALITY GAS, WITH HIGH SYSTEM THROUGHPUT AND SUPERIOR OVERALL ECONOMICS.",

A MICROPOROUS POLYMER FILM WITH ASYMMETRIC PORES LOADED WITH SORBENT PARTICLES FORMS THE BASE FOR A THIN, DENSE FILM OF PERMSELECTIVE POLYMER MATERIAL. THE PERMSELECTIVE LAYER IS HIGHLY PERMEABLE TO WATER VAPOR BUT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES THE PERMEATION OF OTHER CHEMICAL SPECIES. ANY CHEMICAL AGENT THAT DOES PERMEATE THROUGH THIS LAYER IS REMOVED BY SORBENT IN THE POROUS SUPPORT. CONSEQUENTLY, THE FABRIC CAN BE MADE MUCH THINNER AND LIGHTER THAN CONVENTIONAL FABRICS. THE SELECTIVE PERMEATION OF WATER VAPOR FROM WITHIN THE SUIT FACILITATES THE REMOVAL OF PERSPIRATION VAPOR AND MINIMIZES THE RISK OF HEAT STRESS. THE PHASE I PROGRAM WILL DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS APPROACH, AND DETERMINE THE SUITABILITY OF THE MATERIAL FOR GARMENT FABRICATION.

THE GOAL OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO DEVELOP THE TECHNOLOGY FOR MAKING INDUSTRIAL SCALE COMPOSITEMEMBRANES WITH PERMSELECTIVE LAYER THICKNESS DOWN TO 0.1 UM OR BELOW.

THE DSP PROVIDES THE HIGHEST COMPUTATIONAL POWER AND PROGRAMMABILITY IN A COMPACT SIZE ALLOWING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF INTELLIGENT ALGORITHMS WHICH PROCESS LOW SIGNAL LEVELS AND COMPLEX SIGNALS ARISING FROM LIVE MARINE PARTICLES. THE PULSED LASER DIODE OFFERS THE POTENTIAL OF PROVIDING OPTIMUM SIGNAL TO NOISE BY CONCENTRATING ALL OF ITS POWER DURING THE TIMES WHEN THE DIGITIZER IN ON, THUS, IT PROVIDES LARGE BURSTS OF ENERGY DURING THESE SHORT INTERVALS. PULSED LASER DIODES ALSO HAVE THE POTENTIAL OF PROVIDING VERY SIMPLE TWO-VELOCITY COMPONENT SYSTEMS SINCE TWO SETS OF FRINGES CAN BE SEQUENTIALLY PULSED AND THE ELECTRONICS CAN BE SYNCHRONIZED TO TRACK THEM. THE SIZING OF THE PARTICLES WILL ALSO BE ATTEMPED FROM MIE SCATTERED LIGHT. THIS ADDED INFORMATION MAY NOT ALWAYS BE POSSIBLE DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF MULTIPLE PARTICLES AND COMPLEX MARINE SHAPES. THESE CASES WILL BE RECOGNIZTED BY THE DSP AND THE INSTRUMENT WILL ONLY PROVIDE THE VELOCITY INFORMATION.",

IT ALSO SERVES AS A PLATFORM FOR SOFTWARE PROGRAMS TO AID IN THE SELECTION OF TEST VECTORS, THE SIMULATION OF MICROCIRCUIT PERFORMANCE, AND THE ISOLATION OF CIRCUIT ELEMENTS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FAULT. A VHDL DESCRIPTION OF THE MICROCIRCUIT IS THE BASIS FOR THE SIMULATION AND DIAGNOSTIC ALGORITHMS. THE PROPOSED TESTER INCLUDES PROVISIONS FOR BOUNDARY SCAN TESTING AS DEFINED BY THE PROPOSED IEEE STANDARD 91149.1. THE PROPOSED TEST HEAD DESIGNS INCLUDES PROVISIONS FOR TYPICAL ASIC PACKAGE TYPES. IT WILL BE DESIGNED TO PERMIT ALIGNMENT WITH THE RADIATION BEAM AND TO ACCOMMODATE DOSIMETRY. PHASE I ACTIVITIES WILL INCLUDE FEASIBILITY STUDIES WHICH WILL SERVE AS THE BASIS FOR A DETAILED DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF THE SYSTEM IN PHASE II.",

THE VOLATILES ARE AIR-STRIPPED FROM THE WATER AND CATALYTICALLY OXIDIZED. THE TEMPERATURE RISE UPONOXIDATION PROVIDES A MEANS TO BACK-CALCULATE DELTA H(C), AND THEREBY, ORGANIC CONTENT.

THE AIM OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO ESTABLISH THE MEANS OF IDENTIFYING SPECIFIC INHIBITORS OF THIS KINASE THAT COULD BE USED TO EXTEND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BETA-AGONISTS. SPECIFICALLY, A RANGE OF AVAILABLE HUMAN CELLS AND TISSUES WILL BE SCREENED AS POTENTIAL SOURCES OF THE KINASE AND THEN IT WILL BE PURIFIED FROM THE BEST SOURCE. CANDIDATE PEPTIDES WILL BE PREPARED AND EXAMINED AS MODEL SUBSTRATES FOR THE KINASE. THE COMPONENTS WILL THEN BE CONFIGURED TO AHIGH-THROUGHPUT ASSAY DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL DRUGS. IN PHASE II, ONCOGENE SCIENCE, INC., WILL CLONE AND EXPRESS THE KINASE, IF THIS IS REQUIRED, AND INITIATE SCREENING. SECONDARY SCREENS DESIGNED TO EVALUATE THE SPECIFICITY AND IN VIVO EFFECTIVENESS OF LEAD COMPOUNDS FROM THE PRIMARY HIGH-THROUGHPUT SCREEN WILL ALSO BE ESTABLISHED.",

FIRST, IT CAN BE USED AS A PASSIVE DECOY-RESISTANT SENSOR FOR MISSILE GUIDANCE, REPLACING THE PRESENT COMMON HEAT-SEEKING TECHNOLOGY.

THEIR USE INFRESH CONCRETE IS MADE POSSIBLE BY NEW PROCEDURES IN SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO ENHANCEMENT AND CLUTTER SUPPRESSION DEVELOPED AT DREXEL UNIVERSITY.

        "abstract": "A NOVEL APPLICATION IS PRESENTED FOR THE USE OF FABRY-PEROT INTERFEROMETRY AS AN ANGULAR SENSOR. THIS IS PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE THE ANGULAR SENSITIVITY OF A FABRY-PEROT INTERFEROMETER IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE WIDTH OF THE ETALON. HENCE, IT CAN BE MADE MORE SENSITIVE BY WIDENING THE ETALON. A 10 MM WIDE ETALON, FOR EXAMPLE, YIELDS A WHOLE FRINGE FOR EVERY 50 MICRO-RADIANS OF CHANGE IN THE ANGLE OF INCIDENCE AT A WAVELENGTH OF 0.63 MICRON. THIS ANGULAR SENSITIVITY CAN BE USED TO MEASURE SECONDARY PHENOMENA THAT INDUCE ROTATION SUCH AS VIBRATION AND ACCELERATION. CONVENTIONAL FABRY-PEROT ETALONS ARE POLISHED SLABS OF GLASSWHOSE FLATNESS AND PARALLELISM ARE MAINTAINED TO A HIGH DEGREE OF TOLERANCE. THIS PROCESS IS COSTLY AND TIME CONSUMING. WE PRESENT AN ALTERNATIVE WAY OF FABRICATING FABRY-PEROT ETALONS WITH THE USE OF WAVEGUIDE MICROFABRICATION TECHNOLOGY. THERE ARE DISTINCT ECONOMIC ADVANTAGES TO THIS APPROACH BECAUSE THE RESULTANT MICRO-SENSOR WILL BE CHEAPER THAN THE CONVENTIONAL ONE WHEN MASS-PRODUCED. WE AIM AT DETERMINING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MICROFABRICATION TECHNIQUES AT PRODUCING SEMICONDUCTOR MICRO-ETALONS WHOSE PERFORMANCE IS COMPARABLE TO THAT OF THEGLASS ONES.

IN ADDITION TO CREARE'S EXPERIENCE WITH THE CONTINUOUS CASTING PROCESS AND HARDWARE, THE PHASE I PROJECT INCLUDES COLLABORATION WITH HFEF-S PERSONNEL AND REMOTE TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION (OAK RIDGE, TN), A FIRM EXPERIENCED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF REMOTELY OPERATED SYSTEMS IN NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS. WE FEEL CONFIDENT, THEREFORE, THAT THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN FORMULATED IN PHASE I WILL INCORPORATE ALL RELEVANT DESIGN AND OPERATION ISSUES. BASED UPON SUCCESSFUL DEMONSTRATION OF FEASIBILITY, THE PHASE I CONCEPTUAL DESIGN WOULD PROVIDE THE STARTING POINT FOR DETAILED DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF CRITICAL ELEMENTS OF THE CASTING MACHINE FOR EVENTUAL IMPLEMENTAION IN THE HFEF-S.",

RECENT ATTEMPS TO REALIZE SUCH DEVICES HAVE BEEN ONLY PARTIALLY SUCCESSFUL; LIMITED SWITCHING LIFETIMES CAUSED BY FATIGUE IN THE FERROELECTRIC MATERIALS IS STILL A SIGNIFICANT RELIABILITY CONCERN. TO REALIZE THE POTENTIAL OF FERROELETRIC MEMORIES FOR ADVANCED APPLICATIONS, SUPERIOR MATERIALS, AND PROCESSING TEHCNIQUES MUST BE APPLIED TO INCREASED PERFORMANCE RELIABILITY. THIS PROJECT WILL ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF A NOVEL APPROACH TO ACHIEVING DESIRED DEVICE PERFORMANCE BY UTILIZING THIN FILMS OF FERROELECTRIC BISMUTH TITANATE, BI4TI3O12. THE FERROELECTRIC PROPERTIES OF BISMUTH TITANATE, EXTREMELY LOW AGING EFFECT, FAST SWITCHING CAPABILITY AND LOW COERCIVE FIELD, MAKE IT A VERY ATTRACTIVE MATERIAL FOR MEMORY APPLICATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, THE METHOD PROPOSED CAN ACHIEVE LOW TEMPERATURE FORMATION OF ORIENTED THIN FILMS OF BISMUTH TITANATE AND CAN BE INTEGRATED INTO A STANDARD SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESS FLOW. THE PHASE I RESEARCH WILL DEPOSIT BISMUTH TITANATE FILMS AND EXPERIMENTALLY DETERMINE THE FILM'S FERROELECTRIC CHARACTERISTICS AND RELATE THEM TO THE OBSERVED MICROSTRUCTURE AND DEPOSITION PROCESS VARIABLES. THE PROCESS WILL BE OPTIMIZED AND SCALED UP IN PHASE II/ ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - THIS PROCESSING TECHNIQUE WILL ENABLE COMMERCIAL SCALE PRODUCTION OF IN ORIENTED FERROELECTRIC THIN FILMS ON SILICON FOR MICROELECTRONIC MEMORY APPLICATIONS.

THESE MATERIALS POSSESS HIGH STIFFNESSES AND TENSILE STRENGTHS COMBINED WITH LOW DENSITY, AND THEY HAVE BECOME THE MATERIAL OF CHOICE IN NUMEROUS HIGH PERFORMANCE APPLICATIONS. THE SAME CANNOT BE SAID FOR COMPRESSIVE PROPERTIES OF THESE MATERIALS, WHICH ARE OFTEN MUCH LOWER THAN THEIR TENSILE COUNTERPARTS. THIS OFTEN RESULTS IN OVERDESIGNING FOR COMPRESSION, WITH CORRESPONDINGLY HIGHER WEIGHT. REDUCED COMPRESSION BEHAVIOR IN SUCH MATERIALS IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO MICROFIBRILLAR BUCKLING AND KINKING PHENOMENA WHICH MAYBE ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIBER ITSELF, THE MATRIX, OR THE INTERFACE BETWEEN THE TWO.

AN INNOVATIVE RING PHASE CONJUGATE CAVITY GEOMETRY AND A DOUBLE PHASE CONJUGATE GEOMETRY,UTILIZING SINGLE ELEMENT PHOTOREFRACTIVE BATIO3 CRYSTAL, ARE PROPOSED FOR THE LONG TERM STABLE LOCKING OF LASER DIODE ARRAYS WITH SINGLE MAIN LOBE OUTPUT. THESE CONFIGURATIONS CAN ACHIEVE SEVERAL IMMEDIATE ADVANTAGES BY OBTAINING A HIGH QUALITY LASER DIODE SOURCE AS A FUNDAMENTAL BUILDING BLOCK OF LASER COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS. THEY ARE: 1) HIGH POWER, HIGH-BRIGHTNESS LASER DIODE SOURCES WITH COMPACT SIZE; 2) ENVIRONMENTAL INSENSITIVITY AND HIGH BEAM QUALITY; AND 3) LONG LIFE TIME AND LOW POWER CONSUMPTION.",

THIS SYSTEM WILL CONSIST OF MULTIPLE SLAVE DIODE LASERS (OR ARRAYS) FREQUENCY-LOCKED TO A WELL-CONTROLLED MASTER DIODE LASER WHICH WILL OPERATE AT A SINGLE LONGITUDINAL MODE WITH A NARROW LINEWIDTH. FREQUENCY LOCKING BETWEEN THE MASTER AND SLAVES CAN BE OBTAINED BY TUNING THEIR TEMPERATURES AND BIAS CURRENTS IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEIR FREE-RUNNING FREQUENCY SEPARATION IS WITHIN THE LOCKING BANDWIDTH.

STATIONARY CFD ENGINES FOR POWER PRODUCTION WILL HAVE TO COMPETE WITH OTHER CONVENTIONAL SOURCES OF SMALL POWER PRODUCTION. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, NOX EMISSIONS WILL HAVE TO BE REDUCED BY 60TO 80 PERCENT. TO IMPROVE ENERGY CONVERSION EFFICIENCY STATIONARY DIESEL ENGINES ARE EQUIPPED WITH TURBOCHARGERS.

THEREFORE, SELECTIVELY REMOVING CARBON FROM THE PARTICULATE ENTERING THE TURBOCHARGER SHOULD REDUCE THE MEAN PARTICLE SIZE TO ABOUT 7 MUM. PREVIOUS WORK HAS SHOWN THAT NO CAN BE REDUCED TO N2 BY REACTION WITH COAL CHARS. WORK BY PSI TECHNOLOGY COMPANY (PSIT) HAS DEMONSTRATED 70 PERCENT NOX REDUCTION BY CFD PARTICULATE AT 750 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT, DURING WHICH THE CARBON WAS CONSUMED.

A CRITICAL PROBLEM WITH THESE LARGE MCMS IS THAT, WHILE THE REQUIRED INTERCONNECT DENSITIES REQUIRE THE USE OF FAIRLY FINE LINEWIDTHS (-5 UM TYPICALLY), EVEN WHEN IMPLEMENTED IN COPPER OR GOLD THESE LINES BECOME VERY ATTENUATING, DISTORTIVE AND SLOW BEYOND LENGTHS OF A FEW INCHES. THE USE OF HIGH TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTORS FOR THE SIGNAL LINES WOULD VIRTUALLY COMPLETELY ELIMINATE SIGNAL LINE ATTENUATION AT FREQUENCIES OF INTEREST, EVEN AT 1 UM LINEWIDTHS (ALLOWING INCREASED DENSITIES), PLUS PROVIDING NEAR-PERFECT SHIELDING FOR MIXED-MODE ANALOG/DIGITAL MCMS.

GEANT, ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED IN THE 1970S, HAS EMERGED AS A STANDARD TOOL FOR DETECTOR SIMULATION; IT IS SUFFICIENTLY VERSATILE (BY VIRTUE OF ITS GENERAL AND FLEXIBLE GEOMETRY PACKAGE) TO BE USED AT ALL STAGES OF THE DETECTOR DESIGN PROCESS, MERELY BY ADJUSTING THE GRANULARITY OF ITS INPUT.

        "abstract": "IN THE COURSE OF THEIR WORK IN MICROSENSORS, MICROACTUATORS, AND ROBOTICS, SRC AND ITS ASSOCIATES HAVE DEVELOPED A NUMBER OF UNIQUE FIELD-BASED SENSORS UTILIZING FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTORS (FETS). BECAUSE THESE SENSORS EXHIBIT HIGH SENSITIVITY AND EXCELLENT LOW FREQUENCY RESPONSE AND AFFORD THE POSSIBILITY OF DIGITAL OUTPUT SIGNALS, THEY OFFER ADVANTAGES OVER CONVENTIONAL PIEZOELECTRIC OR FERROELECTRIC ELEMENTS IN HYDROPHONES, WHICH PRESENTLY HAVE LIMITED LOW-END FREQUENCY RESPONSES WITH ANALOG OUTPUTS. MICROFABRICATION PRINCIPLES CAN BE APPLIED TO MAKE THE PROPOSED FET SENSORS SMALL, RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE, AND IN LARGE QUANTITIES. THE PROPOSED FET SENSORS CAN ALSO BE NETWORKED INTO VERY LARGE HYDROPHONE ARRAYS VIA MULTIPLEXING CIRCUITRY ON THE FET SENSOR CHIP, ENABLING EFFICIENT DISTRIBUTED SURVEILLANCE THROUGHOUT THE OCEANS. THIS PROPOSAL WILL INVESTIGATE THE SUITABILITY OF FET-BASED MICROSENSORS FOR A NUMBER OF HYDROPHONE-RELATED APPLICATIONS, WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO BANDWIDTHS, SENSITIVITIES AND RESOLUTIONS OF THESE DEVICES. THE PROPOSED PHASE I RESEARCH CONSISTS OF SYSTEM ANALYSIS, PRELIMINARY SENSOR AND PACKAGING DESIGNS, FUNDAMENTAL EXPERIMENTATION, AND FABRICATION PROTOCOLS FOR FET-BASED HYDROPHONE ELEMENTS.

TO BE SERVICEABLE IN NEUROLOGICALLY HANDICAPPED SUBJECTS, SUCH MICROPROBES REQUIRE LONG-TERM PROTECTION FROM REACTIVE EXTRACELLULAR FLUIDS; SILICON NITRIDE FILMS ARE EXCELLENT BARRIERS TO WATER AND ALKALINE IONS. GJD USES SUPERSONIC GAS JETS TO CONVECT SPECIES TO UNHEATED SUBSTRATES WHERE DEPOSITION CAN OCCUR AT NEAR ROOM TEMPERATURE. THIS IS USEFUL FOR ENCAPSULATING MICROPROBE ASSEMBLIES WHERE MATERIALS OF LOW THERMAL STABILITY, E.G., POLYMERS, ARE PRESENT. SILICON NITRIDE FILMS MADE BY LOW-TEMPERATURE REACTIVE GJD ARE FOUND TO BE HARD, ADHERENT,PINHOLE FREE, AND OF HIGH BREAKDOWN STRENGTH. SILICON NITRIDE FILMS WILL BE DEPOSITED ON TEST STRUCTURES THAT SIMULATE THE TOPOGRAPHICAL AND CHEMICAL FEATURES OF MICROPROBES AND THEN WILL BE TESTED FOR CHEMICAL, ELECTRICAL, AND MECHANICAL STABILITY IN IONIC SOLUTION. POSITIVE RESULTS IN PHASE I WILL BE A PRELUDE TO THE COATING AND TESTING OF ACTUAL MICROPROBE ASSEMBLIES IN PHASEII. REACTIVE GJD IS EASILY ADAPTED AS A COMMERCIAL ENCAPSULATION PROCESS.",

UNLIKE TRADITIONAL METHODS OF COMPOSITE MEMBRANE PREPARATION, WHERE THE MEMBRANE BARRIER IS FORMED ON THE SURFACE OF A POROUS MEMBRANE SUPPORT, THE PROPOSED METHOD OF MEMBRANE PREPARATION INVOLVES THE FORMATION OF THE PERMSELECTIVE BARRIER WITHIN THE PORES OF THE MICROPOROUS SUPPORT. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY A PROCESS OF OCCLUSION OR PORE-FILLING, WHEREBY THE REVERSE SIDE OF A FABRIC-REINFORCED MICROPOROUS MEMBRANE IS CONTACTED WITH A DILUTE SOLUTION OF A POLYMER WITH DESIRABLE TRANSPORT PROPERTIES.

OUR APPROACH IS BASED ON THE USE OF MICROPOROUS MEMBRANES BOTH TO IMMOBILIZE THE SYNTHETIC ENZYMES INVOLVED AND TO RECOVER THE REACTION PRODUCT IN PURIFIED FORM. THIS MEMBRANE SYSTEM APPROACH TO THE PRODUCTION OF POSITRON-EMITTING RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING THE TOTAL SYNTHESIS/PURIFICATION TIME, WHICH IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR A RADIONUCLIDE SUCH AS CARBON-11 WITH A 20.4 MINUTE HALF-LIFE.

VSS IS DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE EXTERNAL BLAST OVERPRESSURE, FROM AN EXPLOSIVE OPERATION, TO A HUMAN TOLERABLE LEVEL. A HUMAN TOLERABLE LEVEL IS DEFINED AS BEING THAT WHICH WILL NOT CAUSE EARDRUM DAMAGE AT A DISTANCE OF 2 METERS. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THIS PROTECTION THE EXTERNAL BLAST OVERPRESSURE MUST BE REDUCED TO 2.3 PSI OR LOWER. SINCE THERE IS DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BLAST OVERPRESSURE AND SOUND LEVEL (DB), REDUCTION OF EXTERN OVERPRESSURE ALSO RESULTS IN SOUND LEVEL REDUCTION. IN PHASE I, VSS ENCLOSURE CONCEPTS AND DESIGNS WILL BE DEVELOPED TO REDUCE THE EXTERNAL SOUND LEVEL BY A 20 DB GOAL, FROM EXPLOSIVE OPERATIONS AND/OR MUNITIONS TESTING. INFORMATION FROM PRIOR TESTED DESIGNS, AND CALCULATIONS FOR SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS WILL BE APPLIED, VSS ENCLOSURES, IN ADDITION TO BLAST OVERPRESSURE REDUCTION, SUPPRESS AND CONTAIN FRAGMENTS AND THERMAL HAZARDS.",

THE LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE OF THE RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP AN INTERACTIVE DRIVING SIMULATOR THAT COULD BE USED TO TRAIN, EVALUATE, AND STUDY DRIVING PERFORMANCE IN VISUALLY AND PHYSICALLY IMPAIRED PERSONS AS WELL AS NEW AND ELDERLY DRIVERS. IN PHASE I, SINTEX CORPORATION WILL CONSTRUCT A PROTOTYPE INTERACTIVE DRIVING SIMULATOR INCORPORATING ADVANCED DISPLAYTECHNOLOGY, AS USED IN MODERN FLIGHT SIMULATION. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF PHASE I ARE: (1) TO DEVELOP REALISTIC VISUALS (THE DATABASE) FOR A DRIVING SIMULATOR AND (2) TO INTEGRATE THIS VISUAL DATABASE WITH, INITIALLY, THREE COMPONENTS OF A DRIVING CONSOLE: STEERING WHEEL, BRAKE, AND ACCELERATOR. IN PHASE II, THE VISUAL DATABASE WILL BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDEBOTH A CRITICAL-INCIDENT AS WELL AS ROUTINE DRIVING SCENARIOS IN A WORKING PROTOTYPE. THE EFFICACY OF THIS PROTOTYPE WILL THEN BE FIELD-TESTED.",

THE CRITICAL WEAKNESS OF THE MOCVD TECHNIQUE IS ITS DEPENDENCE ON ARSINE GAS AS THE GROUP V REAGENT. THE EXTREME TOXICITY OF THIS SUBSTANCE NECESSITATES COSTLY DETECTION AND SAFETY EQUIPMENT.

A LOW-COST PROCESS FOR THESE CONVERSIONS HAS BEEN INVENTED BY DR. VAN DIJK AND MR. FRALEY. ANALYSIS OF APPLICATION OF THIS PROCESS TO THE PROBLEM AS DEFINED IN TOPIC 4, SUBTOPIC D, MERITS FURTHER STUDY, WHICH IS THE DRIVING FORCE FOR THE PRESENT REQUEST. THE PRODUCT YIELD FOR THE PROCESS IS EXPECTED TO BE BETWEEN 65 AND 70%, CARBON ON CARBON. SOME OF THE MODERN METHANOL PROCESSES, STARTING FROM PRESSURIZED METHANE, HAVE HIGHER YIELDS, LIKE OVER 80 % CARBON ON CARBON. SUCH HIGHER YIELDSTHEN CAN COMBINE WITH THE MOBIL PROCESS TO ATTAIN 80 % OVERALL YIELDS TO HYDROCARBONS FOR FUEL USE, AS CLAIMED BY HALDOR-TOPSOE FOR THE TIGAS PROCESS. THESE HIGHER YIELDS, HOWEVER, CAN NOT BE OBTAINED AT ACCEPTABLE CAPITAL COSTS, BECAUSE THE STARTING METHANOL PLANTS CAN NOT BE BUILT AT EXTREMELY LOW CAPITAL COSTS, WHICH IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE PROJECTED USE. NOTWITHSTANDING THE SOMEWHAT LOWER YIELD, THE PRESENT PROCESS PROMISES TO PROVIDE AN ECONOMICALLY ATTRACTIVE CONVERSION FOR METHANE TO FUEL STREAMS. THE STUDY WILL AIM AT FINDING THE PROPER EQUIPMENT, COMBINED WITH OPTIMIZED FLOWSHEET CONDITIONS FOR THAT EQUIPMENT, FOR DIFFERENT STARTING METHANE FLOWS AND ASSUMING DIFFERENT PRESSURES AT SOURCE.

THE ADAPTATION OF THIS TECHNOLOGY TO WHEELED AND TRACKED MILITARY VEHICLES WILL PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN BOTH HANDLING AND RIDE. A SECOND BENEFIT OF THIS TYPE OF SUSPENSION IS THAT IT CAN EASILY ACCEPT EXTERNAL SENSOR INPUT, TO ALLOW ADAPTIVE RESPONSE CAPABILITY. THIS MEANS THAT SUSPENSION CHARACTERISTICS CAN BE READILY ALTERED TO ACCOMMODATE CHANGES IN VEHICLE GROSS WEIGHT, ROAD CONDITIONS, AND MISSION PROFILES. A THIRD BENEFIT IS THE RELATIVE SIMPLICITY OF THE COMPRESSIBLE FLUID SUSPENSION, AS COMPARED TO BOTH PNEUMATIC AND MECHANICAL DESIGNS HAVING ADAPTIVE CAPABILITY. A SIMPLE COMPRESSIBLE FLUID STRUT PROVIDES MAXIMUM CAPABILITY WITH A MINIMUM NUMBER OF PARTS. THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THE DESIGN OF A COMPRESSIBLE FLUID SUSPENSION HAVING ADAPTIVE SPRING AND DAMPING CHARACTERISTICS. THE CANDIDATE VEHICLE IS THE USMC LAV-25, WITHIN WHICH AN ADEQUATE ENVELOPE EXISTS TO APPLY THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY.",

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS PHASE I RESEARCH IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY AND APPLY PACKED-BED SEDIMENTATION TECHNIQUES TO ACHIEVE THE DESIGN PARAMETERS FOR A BLOOD SEPARATION DEVICE THAT WILL OPERATE AT 300 TO 500 GRAVITIES. PACKED-BED SEDIMENTATION ALSO HOLDS PROMISE FOR MORE EFFICIENT DEGLYCEROLIZATION OF BLOOD THAT HAS BEEN FROZEN FOR LONG-TERM STORAGE.

THIS PROGRAM WILL SERVE AS THE PROTOTYPE FOR FURTHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF \"SPECIAL NEEDS\" SOFTWARE. THE RESULT OF THE PHASE II PROJECT WILL BE A RESEARCH TOOL WHICH COLLECTS DATA UNOBTRUSIVELY FROM CHILDREN WITH EXTENSIVELY VARIED BACKGROUNDS AND NEEDS. THIS DATA COLLECTION WILL SUPPORT THE CREATION OF SIMULATIONS BASED UPON THE EMPIRICAL DATA COLLECTED. AS A RESULT, WE WILL BE ABLE TO MODIFY PROGRAMS AND BETTER UNDERSTAND DIFFERENCES INTHE PROCESS OF LEARNING BETWEEN A MULTITUDE OF SPECIAL NEEDSCHILDREN. CONSEQUENTLY, WE MAY IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LEARNING FOR THIS POPULATION OF CHILDREN BY WORKING TOWARD DEVELOPMENT OF COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE EDUCATIONAL SOFTWARE DESIGNED TO MEET THE DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS OF SUCH CHILDREN.

        "abstract": "THIS COUNTRY IS FACING AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT PROBLEM IN PROVIDING ELECTRIC ENERGY IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FOR THE NEAR FUTURE. THIS PROBLEM IS COMPOUNDED, ON THE ONE HAND, BY THE VERY HIGH COST OF NUCLEAR POWER, THE EXTREMELY LONG APPROVAL AND CONSTRUCTION TIMES, AND THE SHUTTING DOWN OF SEVERAL PLANTS EVEN BEFORE START UP BECAUSE OF THE CONCERNS OF LOCAL CITIZENS. ON THE OTHER HAND, CONVENTIONAL POWER PLANT INSTALLATIONS FOR NEW BASE LOAD GENERATION, WHICH COSTONE BILLION DOLLARS AND UP, EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM OF POLLUTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE DEPLETION OF SCARCE NATURAL RESOURCES. IT IS NOT SURPRISING, THEREFOR, THAT STATE POWER COMMISSIONS HAVE TURNED MORE AND MORE TO DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT ALTERNATIVES IN THE FORM OF INEXPENSIVE, OFF-PEAK ELECTRIC THERMAL STORAGE TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. UNFORTUNATELY, ONE OF THE MAJOR IMPEDIMENTS TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE PROGRAMS IS THE LACK OF AN OFF-PEAK ELECTRIC STORAGE APPLIANCE WHICH CAN OVERCOME THE SERIOUS PROBLEMS OF THOSE DEVICES ON THE MARKET TODAY. ALL OF THE PRESENT ELECTRIC STORAGE APPLIANCES ARE BASED ON THE STORAGEOF \"SENSIBLE\" THERMAL ENERGY IN HIGH DENSITY BRICKS. THESE BRICKS, WHICH WEIGH 172 POUNDS FOR A STORAGE CAPACITY OF 40,000 BTU, ARE HEATED TO ABOUT 1400 DEGREES FARENHEIT, WHICH RESULTS IN SEVERAL UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS: THEY OVERHEAT THE ROOM AND THEY ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO THERMALLY CONTROL; THEY SCORCH THE RUGS THEY STAND ON AS WELL AS THE WALLS BEHIND THEM; AND THEY ARE INEFFICIENT IN THEIR USE OF ELECTRICITY DURING CHARGE-UP. CONSEQUENTLY, IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE USE OF OFF-PEAK ELECTRIC THERMAL STORAGE APPLIANCES, THEY NEED TO BE MADE MORE ATTRACTIVE TO POTENTIAL USERS BY THE OVERCOMING OF THESE PROBLEMS. OUR PROPOSAL OVERCOMES ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS BY USING AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH WHICH ALLOWS MORE ENERGY TO BE STORED, AT A LOWER TEMPERATURE, IN A SMALLER VOLUME THAN THE SAME MASS OF BRICKS CAN. OUR PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDES THE IDEA FOR A VERY EFFECTIVE INSULATION SYSTEM WHICH WILL PROVIDE FOR A TEMPERATURE DROP BETWEEN THE CORE OF THE STORAGE CONTAINER AND THE OUTER SURFACE OF THE APPLIANCE OF ABOUT 650 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT IN 1/4\", THEREBY MAINTAINING THE LATTER SURFACE NEAR AMBIENT. WITH THESE MAJOR PRODUCT IMPROVEMENTS WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR COMPANY WILL CAPTURE A SIGNIFICANT FRACTION OF THE WORLD WIDE ELECTRIC STORAGE MARKET, WHICH IN ENGLAND ALONE, AMOUNTS TO ANNUAL SALES OF OVER ONE MILLION UNITS.",

THIS TEMPERATURE PRECLUDES THE USE OF LIQUID LUBRICANTS, DICTATING INSTEAD THE USE OF DRY FILM LUBRICANTS.

HOWEVER, THE OXIDATION THRESHOLD OF C-C IS ONLY ABOUT 370 DEG C. OPERATION AT HIGHER TEMPERATURES IN AN OXIDIZING ENVIRONMENT ULTIMATELY REQUIRES OXIDATION-PROTECTIVE COATINGS FOR EXTENDED LIFETIMES. ULTRAMET HAS DEVELOPED A PROPRIETARY OXIDATIONRESISTANT COATING SYSTEM, ULTRA 2000, BASED ON THE HAFNIUM CARBIDE/ SILICON CARBIDE (HFC/SIC) SYSTEM THAT HAS DEMONSTRATED OXIDATION PROTECTION FOR CARBON-CARBON COMPOSITES IN ONE ATMOSPHERE OF AIR AT 1800 DEG C FOR EXTENDED PERIODS (HOURS) AND TO 1925 DEG C FOR SHORTER PERIODS. THIS COATING, DEPOSITED BY CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION (CVD), UTILIZES THE FORMATION OF HAFNIUM SILICATE TO REDUCE OXYGEN DIFFUSION THROUGH THE COATING.

THE PROPOSED METHOD CONSISTS OF ADAPTING THE ESPIRIT ALGORITHM FOR ESTIMATION OF ELEVATION ANGLE-OF-ARRIVAL TO SYNTHESIZE A 2-D ARRAY FROM THE MULTIPLE FLIGHT PATHS. THIS APPROACH ALLOWS THE COHERENT ADDITION OF THE LOW RADAR CROSS-SECTION POWER LINE SIGNATURES TO ACCUMULATE COHERENTLY IN A RANGE BIN NOT CONTAINING THE BACKGROUND. THEREFORE, THE DETECTION PROBLEM HAS BEEN EFFECTIVELY TRANFORMED FROM A VERY DIFFICULT SIGNAL/CLUTTER PROBLEM INTO A SOLUBLE SIGNAL/NOICE PROBLEM. IN ADDITION, THE USE OF POLARIMETRIC QUADPOLE SAR DATA WILL SELECTIVELY ENHANCE THE POWER LINE AND TOWER SIGNATURES. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - AUTOMATED TERRAIN MAPPING, NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, TARGET DETECTION AND IDENTIFICATION.

PART OF THIS DIFFICULTY ARISES FROM THE FACT THAT A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES (MABS) ARE INACTIVATED DURING RADIOLABELING PROCEDURES AND SUCH MABS, WHEN INJECTEDINTRAVENOUSLY, LOCALIZE NONSPECIFICALLY IN NORMAL TISSUES. THIS PROJECT ADDRESSES THE PROBLEM THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INNOVATIVE METHOD FOR EFFECTIVELY SEPARATING ANTIBODIES DAMAGED DURING RADIOLABELING PROCEDURES FROM THOSE RETAINING THEIR ORIGINAL AFFINITY AND SPECIFICITY. PRELIMINARY STUDIES INDICATE THAT ANTI-IDIOTYPIC (ANTI-ID) MABS RECOGNIZING THE COMBINING SITES OF ANTIMELANOMA MABS CAN BE PREPARED AS AFFINITY MATRICES TO PURIFY THE ANTIMELANOMA MABS AFTER RADIOLABELING PROCEDURES. THE IMMUNOREACTIVITY, SPECIFICITY, AFFINITY, AND TUMOR-TO-TISSUE RATIOS OF IN-111-LABELED ANTIMELANOMA MABS WILL BE ASSAYED BEFORE AND AFTER IMMUNOAFFINITY PURIFICATION WITH ANTI-ID MABS.

THE WARNING DEVICE WOULD HELP AVOID THECONSEQUENCES OF A MISTAKE BY HALTING DRUG DELIVERY UNTIL THECHOICE OF DRUG IS VERIFIED BY THE ANESTHESIOLOGIST. AN ARGON LASER (488 NM) WILL BE USED TO IDENTIFY THE MAJOR RAMAN SCATTERING PEAKS FOR 41 COMMON PERIANESTHETIC DRUGS. A CLASSIFICATION TECHNIQUE WILL BE DEVELOPED TO UNIQUELY IDENTIFY EACH DRUG IN CLINICAL CONCENTRATIONS, ACCORDING TO THE FEATURES IN ITS RAMAN SPECTRUM. A FLOWMETER WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR USE WITH THE RAMAN SYSTEM TO MEASURE INTRAVENOUS FLOW RATES (0.1 TO 60 ML/MIN, 10 PERCENT ACCURACY), SO THE AMOUNT OF DRUG INJECTED CAN BE CALCULATED. THE ACCURACY OF THE FLOWMETER WILL BE TESTED USING RAPID AND SLOW SYRINGE INJECTIONS. THE SYSTEM WILL BE TESTED SIMULATING A CLINICAL ENVIRONMENT WHERE 41 DRUGS ARE INJECTED IN TYPICAL DILUTIONSAND AT TYPICAL FLOW RATES. THE RESULTS WILL DOCUMENT THE ACCURACY OF DRUG IDENTIFICATION AND THE MEASUREMENT ERROR FOR THE AMOUNT OF DRUG INFUSED. RESULTS WILL LEAD TO A PORTABLE RAMAN ANALYZER WHERE THE SAMPLE CUVETTE AND FLOWMETER ARE PLACED IN THE INTRAVENOUS LINE GOING TO THE PATIENT.",

THIS INNOVATIVE CONCEPT WOULD INVESTIGATE THE APPLICATION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGY, SPECIFICALLY HYPERMEDIA TECHNOLOGY WITH EMBEDDEDEXPERT SYSTEMS, TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND REQUIREMENTS OF COUNTY AGENTS. THIS MEETS A USDA NEED FOR INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY TO ASSIST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN RURAL AREAS. COUNTY AGENTS ARE REQUIRED TO ANSWER AND RESEARCH A VARIETY OF QUESTIONS ON A VAST ARRAY OF AGRICULTURAL PROBLEMS FOR LOCAL CITIZENS. QUESTIONS RANGE FROM INDETIFICATION OF PESTS AND DISEASES, TO CONTROL METHODOLOGIES AND OTHER FACETS OF AGRICULTURE. ADDITIONALLY, THEY MUST HAVE ACCESS TO EXPERTS SUCH AS PLANT PATHOLOGISTS, ENTOMOLOGISTS AND WEED SCIENTISTS. THE PROGRESS BEING MADE TODAY IN THE TECHNOLOGY OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP A HYPERMEDIA SYSTEM FOR THE COUNTY AGENT. OUR TECHNICAL APPROACH IS TO INTERVIEW SELECTED EXPERTS IN THE COUNTY AGENT ENVIRONMENT, DOCUMENT THEIR DECISION PROCESSES, SELECT PROGRAMMING TECHNIQUES, DEVELOP AKNOWLEDGE BASE, AND FINALLY DEVELOP A HYPERMEDIA SYSTEM PROTOTYPE. THIS APPROACH WILL RESULT IN DEMONSTRATING THE FEASIBILITY OF CAAS AND WILL BE THE FOUNDATION OF A FULL-UP OPERATIONAL PROTOTYPE EFFORT IN PHASE II. AT THE END OF THE PHASE II EFFORT, USDA WILL POSSES A DOCUMENTED SOFTWARE PACKAGE AND HARDWARE SPECIFICATIONS TO OPTIMALLY RUN THE CAAS. THIS PROGRAM WILL CONTAIN THE ACCUMULATED KNOWLEDGE AND DECISION PROCESS OF SELECTED USDA AND COUNTY AGENT EXPERTS. POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: XMCO STRONGLY BELIEVES CAAS COULD BE REPACKAGED INTO A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS AND RETAILED TO THE CONSUMERS ENGAGED IN GARDENING. FOR EXAMPLE, A PROGRAM FOR VEGETABLE GARDENERS WOULD OFFER EXPERT ADVICE ON HOW TO PLAN, PREPARE, PLANT CARE FOR, HARVEST, AND STORE VEGETABLES. ALSO, CAAS COULD BE PACKAGED FOR AVAILABILITY TO CUSTOMERS AT NURSERIES AND LANDSCAPING FIRMS.",
