        "abstract": "OF PARASITIC INFECTIONS\". SCHISTOSOMIASIS REMAINS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PARASITIC DISEASES IN THE WORLD, PARTICULARLY IN THE RURAL AGRARIAN THIRD WORLD. CURRENT DEVELOPMENT OF EXPANDED AGRICULTURAL PROGRAMS UTILIZING PERENNIAL IRRIGATION SCHEMES AND WATER IMPOUNDMENT HAVE PROMOTED THE SPREAD OF THIS DISEASE. DEVELOPMENT OF VACCINES HAS BEEN SLOW FOR THIS AND OTHER WELL-KNOWN PROTOZOAN AND HELMINTHIC INFECTIONS. A MOST PROMISING APPROACH HAS BEEN UTILIZATION OF RADIATION-ATTENUATED CERCARIAE OR SHCISTOSOMULA WHICH IS INTENDED TO STIMULATE ANTIBODY PRODUCTION IN THE HOST WITHOUT RESULTING IN A FULL-SCALE INFESTATION OR FURTHER PROPAGATION OF THE PARASITE. RESULTS TO DATE HAVE NOT BEEN DEFINITIVE ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY ADOPTION OF THIS APPROACH AS A METHOD OF PREVENTION OR CONTROL. IN PREPARING THE IRRADIATED VACCINES, LOW LINEAR ENERGY TRANSFER (LET) RADIATION (X-RAYSAND ELECTRONS) HAVE BEEN USED. WE BELIEVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN RELIABILITY OF RESULTS (STERILITY AND INHIBITION OF GROWTH ALONG WITH ADEQUATE HOST ANTIBODY PRODUCTION) CAN BE ACHIEVED BY USE OF HIGH LET RADIATION PROTONS, NEUTRONS, OR HEAVIER CHARGED PARTICLES). THE RELATIVELY HIGH MUTAGENICITY VS. KILL OF HIGH LET RADIATION HAS BEEN WELL ESTABLISHED. SHOULD THIS APPROACH PROVE CORRECT, WE BELIEVE THE PROBABILITY OF PREPARING A LONGER- LIVED VACCINE IS ENHANCED. WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY OTHER STUDY USING THIS APPROACH. THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS HAVEHAD EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN THE APPLICATIONS OF RADIATION INGENERAL AND IN THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR A VACCINE. SHOULD THE RESULTS OF PHASE I PROVE POSITIVE, IT WOULD LEAD TO A PHASE II EFFORT DIRECTED TOWARD ACHIEVING ACCEPTANCE AND RELIABLE, REPRODUCIBLE PRODUCTION. THE COMMERCIAL VALUE OF IRRADIATED ORGANISM VACCINES IN VETERINARY MEDICINEHAS ALREADY BEEN WELL DEMONSTRATED. PRELIMINARY DISCUSSIONSWITH PRINCIPALS OF A MAJOR U.S. PHARMACEUTICAL ORGANIZATION INDICATES THAT THERE COULD BE SIGNIFICANT INTEREST IN DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE, AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE VACCINE. THE GREATEST INTEREST WILL BE WITHIN THOSE ORGANIZATIONS WORKING WITH BIOLOGICALS. A RELIABLE, SAFE, AND LONGER LIVED VACCINE BASED ON IRRADIATED IMMATURE SCHISTOSOMES WILLBE UTILIZED EXTENSIVELY.",

THE KEY TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION THAT MAKES SUCH A VEHICLE COMPETITIVE WITH ITS MORE TRADITIONAL MULTI-STAGE COUNTERPARTS IS THE INTEGRATED N NOZZLE ASSEMBLY (TINA). TINA UTILIZES ONE LARGE NOZZLE TO PRODUCE A LARGE EXPANSION RATIO FOR THE HIGH ALTITUDE BURNING MOTOR (S) AS THE SAME NOZZLE FOR THE LOW ALTITUDE BURINING MOTORS. THEREFORE, IT APPEARS THAT A TINA\\CLUSTER BASED VEHICLE COULD AFFORD THE USER AN ATTRACTIVE ALTERNATIVE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW MOTOR\\VEHICLE. ASTROSPACE PROPOSES THAT A PHASE I SBIR CONTRACT BE ISSUED TO IDENTIFY THE KEY NOZZLE AND VEHICLE DESIGN ELEMENTS AND THEIR INTERACTIONS IN THIS UNIQUE CONFIGURATION, RESULTING IN A BASELINE VEHICLE TO BE THE SUBJECT OF A PHASE II RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORT.",

THE PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION IS DERIVED FROM EARLIER NON-INVASIVE RESEARCH ON HUMANS AND FROM INVASIVE STUDIES ON DOGS, IN WHICH AN IMPROVED METHOD OF NON-INVASIVE DETECTION OF THE TIME OF CLOSURE OF THE AORTIC AND PULMONARYVALVES HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. THE TECHNIQUE DEPENDS ON THE DETECTION OF SUBTLE BUT DISTINCT MOVEMENTS OF THE CHEST WALLOVERLYING THE HEART, MOVEMENTS RESULTING FROM THE FORCES CREATED BY CLOSING AND TENSING THESE VALVES. SINCE THE TIMEINTERVAL SEPARATING THE CLOSURE OF THESE TWO VALVES IS KNOWNTO DEPEND ON THE LEVEL OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL PRESSURE, THE APPLICATION OF THIS TECHNIQUE TO THE PROBLEM OF NON-INVASIVEASSESSMENT OF PULMONARY HYPERTENSION IS A NATURAL EXTENSION OF THIS TECHNOLOGY. THIS TECHNIQUE CAUSES NO DANGER OR DISCOMFORT TO THE CHILD, AND DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH HIS/HERCARE OR TREATMENT. PULMONARY HYPERTENSION IS A CENTRAL FACTOR IN PATHOGENESIS OF PERSISTENT FETAL CIRCULATION AND MAY BE A COMPLICATING FACTOR IN RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME. IT IS ALSO A VERY SERIOUS COMPLICATION OF CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS SUCH AS PATENT DUCTUS ARTERIOSUS. IF THIS RESEARCH IS SUCCESSFUL, A PRACTICAL NON-INVASIVE BEDSIDE MONITOR OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL PRESSURE WILL RESULT, WHICH WILL BE SIMPLE AND INEXPENSIVE SO AS TO BE USEFUL EVENIN SMALL HOSPITALS. THE INSTRUMENT MAY HAVE WIDE RANGING COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS. THE INSTRUMENT CAN BE OPERATED BY NURSING PERSONNEL.

WHILE A GREAT NUMBER OF SHORT TERM ASSAYS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO DETECT COMPOUNDS WHICH INDUCE EITHER GENE MUTATIONS OR CHROMOSOMAL DAMAGE, LITTLE RESEARCH HAS FOCUSEDON THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHORT TERM ASSAYS TO DETECT ANEUPLOIDY. THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MAMMALIAN CELL CULTURE ASSAY TO DETECT ANEUPLOIDY WOULD PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN DETECTING CHEMICALS WHICH MAY CAUSE EITHER BIRTH DEFECTS OR CANCER IN HUMANS. THE CAK LINE IS EXTREMELY USEFUL FOR THISPURPOSE SINCE IT IS NEAR DIPLOID LINE, AND A SELECTIVE SYSTEM CAN BE DEVELOPED IN WHICH ANEUPLOIDY CAN BE DETECTED USING RESISTANCE TO 2,6-DIAMINOPURINE (DAP). THIS ELIMINATES THE NEED TO DETECT ANEUPLOIDY BY COMPARING THE DISTRIBUTION OF CHROMOSOMES IN TREATED AND UNTREATED CELLS. A CLONE OF CAK CELLS, CAK-B3 TOY(R)-13, IS HETEROZGOUS FOR A PHYSICAL MARKER ON CHROMOSOME 8, WHICH CARRIES THE ADENINEPHOSPHORIBOSYL TRANSFERASE GENE. THE MAJOR GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO ESTABLISH A CAK LINE WHICH IS HETEROZYGOUS FOR BOTH APRT AND FOR THE PHYSICAL MARKER ON CHROMOSOME 8. THE GENE CODING FOR APRT WOULD THEN BE LINKED TO A CHROMOSOME WHICH CAN BE EASILY IDENTIFIED IN METAPHASE PREPARATIONS. THE CLONE WHICH IS HETEROZYGOUS FOR BOTH THE PHYSICAL MARKER ON CHROMOSOME 8 AND FOR APRT ACTIVITY CAN BE USED TO SCREEN CHEMICALS EITHER FOR THEIR ABILITY TO INDUCE MUTATIONS OR INDUCE ANEUPLOIDY. RESISTANT CELLS TO DAP (PRESUMABLY APRT) WILL BE EXAMINED FOR LOSS OF THE CHROMOSOME CARRYING THE APRT+ ALLELE WHICH IS A DEMONSTRATION OF ANEUPLOIDY. THIS IS IN CONTRAST TO INDUCTION OF MUTATIONS TO APRT- IN WHICH BOTH THE PHYSICALLYNORMAL AND ABNORMAL CHROMOSOME 8 WOULD BE PRESENT IN RESISTANT CELLS. THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF A RELATIVELYINEXPENSIVE, RAPID SCREENING TEST FOR THESE END-POINTS (ANEUPLOIDY, TUMOR PROMOTION) WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT ADDITION TO CURRENT \"IN VITRO\" SCREENING BATTERIES AND COULD SIGNIFICANTLY LESSEN THE OVERALL COST (TO BOTH THE GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE SECTOR) OF DETERMINING THE SAFETY OF NEW CHEMICALS AND DRUGS.

ONE GOAL OF SUCCESSFUL SURGERY, THEN, IS TO PREVENTOR MINIMIZE SCAR TISSUE FORMATION AT THE WOUND SITE. PRELIMINARY STUDIES SUGGEST THAT HYALURONIC ACID (HA) APPLIED BETWEEN THE TENDON AND ITS SHEATH MIGHT DETER ADHESION FORMATION WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY PROMOTING HEALING OFTHE TENDON. USING A PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION OF HYALURONIC ACID TO BE PRODUCED AND CHARACTERIZED AT OUR FACILITY, WE WILL DETERMINE EFFECTIVENESS BASED ON TENDON ADHESION FORMATION IN THE RABBIT TENDON ADHERENCE MODEL SYSTEM. GENERAL CRITERIA WILL ENCOMPASS MICROANGIOGRAPHY, HISTOLOGY, AND BIOMECHANICAL TESTING. EXPERIMENTALLY WE WOULD VARY THE CHAINLENGTH OF THE PREPARATION IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EQUAL HYALURONIC ACID CONCENTRATIONS OF SHORT (LESS THAN 100K), INTERMEDIATE (100-750K), AND LONG CHAIN (GREATER THAN 750K) MOLECULAR WEIGHTS.WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE STUDIES PROPOSED HEREIN (SEE SPECIFICAIMS) CAN DEFINITELY DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF AN HA PREPARATION USED AT THE TIME OF SURGERY TO PREVENT ADHESION FORMATION.

BY COMPARING OVER TIME THE RATIO OF THESE TWO ANTIBODIES IN BLOOD, IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO DETECT SPECIFIC CLEARANCE OF THE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY THAT DETECTS ANTIGENS WITHIN THE ATHEROSCLEROTIC PLAQUE. THE EXTENT RATE OF ANTIBODY CLEARANCE SHOULD BE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE AMOUNT OF ATHEROSCLEROTIC PLAQUE IN THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM. IF SUCCESSFUL, THIS METHOD COULD BE USED FOR EARLY IN VIVO DIAGNOSIS OF ATHEROSCLEROSIS AND FOR MONITORING THE RESULTS OF THERAPY IN INDIVIDUALS.",

AN ORGANIC LIQUID WITH LOW SOLUBILITY IN BLACK LIQUOR IS ADDED PRIOR TO ACIDIFICATION. AS THE SUBMICRON PARTICLES FORM, THEY RAPIDLY AGGLOMERATE INTO LARGE, FLUFFY, COMPACTS WHICH FLOAT UPWARD. LIGNIN PARTICLES ARE DISCHARGED INTO A LAYER OF THE ORGANIC LIQUID AT THE TOP OF THE BLACK LIQUOR, FORMING A SLURRY. A FREE-FLOWING LIGNIN POWDER OF HIGH PURITY IS RECOVERED BY SPRAY DRYING THE SLURRY. THERMAL ENERGY LOST FROM THE BLACK LIQUOR IS REPLACED BY PULVERIZED COAL.",

HOWEVER, THEY ARE GENERALLY UNAVAILABLE TO HOSPITALS DUE TO THE HIGH COST OF AN IN-HOUSE CYCLOTRON. THE PROPOSED PROGRAM IS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW ACCELERATOR SOURCE WHICH CAN GENERATE SHORT-LIVED RADIONUCLIDES ON SITE AT LOW COST. THIS WILL BROADEN THE USE OF POSITRON-EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY IN NUCLEAR MEDICINE IN THE UNITED STATES. THE NEW SOURCE ISA PLASMA FOCUS DEUTERON SOURCE (PFDS). DEUTERONS HAVE BEEN PRODUCED WITH PLASMA FOCUS DEVICES. IN THE PROPOSED PHASE IPROGRAM, A PROOF OF CONCEPT SOURCE WILL BE BUILT AT MAXWELL BY MOUNTING A PLASMA FOCUS DEVICE ON AN EXISTING PULSE POWERSYSTEM (A COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE MAXWELL PRODUCT, MAGNEFORM [R] 8000); THE USE OF AN EXISTING SUPPLY MINIMIZES THE COST OF THE PROOF OF CONCEPT DEMONSTRATION. THIS SOURCE WILL BE USED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE DEUTERONS GENERATED BY THE PFDSHAVE ENOUGH ENERGY TO PRODUCE (15)O THROUGH THE REACTION (14)N(D,N) (13)O WHEN THEY IMPINGE ON A SOLID TARGET OF LITHIUM NITRIDE (LI(3)N). THE AMOUNT OF (15)O PRODUCED WILLBE DETERMINED BY MEASURING THE RADIOACTIVITY (GAMMA EMISSION) OF THE TARGET AFTER DEUTERON IRRADIATION. VARIATIONS IN THE AMOUNT OF (15)O PRODUCED AS A FUNCTION OF DISCHARGE VOLTAGE AND D(2) PRESSURE IN THE PFDS WILL BE OBSERVED TO PROVIDE SCALING LAWS. IN LATER PROGRAM PHASES, IT WIL BE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE PFDS IS ALSO CAPABLE OF PRODUCING THE SHORT-LIVED POSITRON EMITTERS (11)C, (13)N, (15)O, AND (17)F THROUGH (D.N.) REACTIONS. THE APPLICANT'S EXPERIENCE WITH PULSED SOURCES INDICATE THAT THE PFDS WILL BE MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE TO FABRICATE AND OPERATE THAN THE CYCLOTRONS NOW USED FOR THIS PURPOSE. THIS WILL ALLOW MUCH WIDER DISTRIBUTION OF THE RADIONUCLIDES REQUIRED FOR POSITRON-EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY (PET). THE AVAILABILITY OF A RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE SOURCE OF THESE RADIONUCLIDES WOULD RAPIDLY EXPAND THE USE OF PET IN MEDICAL CENTERS.",

DIGITAL IMAGE INFORMATION FROM ALL TYPES OF DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES CAN BE CONVERTED TO DIGITAL FORM. THIS INFORMATION CAN BE PROCESSED WITH A VARIETY OF MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES, ENABLING THE OBSERVER TO GET MORE OUT OF THE OUTPUT (PROCESSED) IMAGE THAN COULD BE SEEN IN THE INPUT (ORIGINAL) IMAGE. IN THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE, PHYSICIANS REQUIRE MANY FORMS OF VISUAL INFORMATION TO SUCCESSFULLY CONDUCT THEIR TASKS. EACH MEDICAL SPECIALITY GENERATES A CLASS OF VISUAL IMAGES FROM WHICH INFORMATION IS EXTRACTED FOR USE BY THE PATIENT'S PHYSICIAN.

FROM THIS ANALYSIS WILL BE CREATED A STRUCTURED MATRIX WHICH WILL ELIMINATE FROM FUTURE PRODUCTION OF MEDICAL TEACHING MODULES, REPETITIVE COSTS IN INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN AND PRODUCTION INEFFICIENCIES. THROUGHUSE OF THIS MATRIX AND FORMAT, A FULL COURSE OF STUDY MAY BEPREPARED WHICH WILL SIMULATE EFFECTIVE IN-PERSON TEACHING TECHNIQUES AND METHODS, MAINTAIN A CONSTANT QUALITY THROUGHOUT THE SERIES AND REDUCE COST BY A TARGET GOAL OF FIFTY PERCENT (50%). THIS PROJECT WILL BE CONDUCTED IN A COOPERATIVE ARRANGEMENT WITH THE PROGRAM IN MEDICAL SCIENCES(PIMS) AT FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY AND THE COMPANION PHASE APROGRAM AT THE COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA. BOTH UNIVERSITIES WILL PROVIDE INPUT, CONSULTATION ON INSTRUCTIONAL TECHNIQUES AND COURSE CONTENT, AND SERVE AS TEST SITES FOR THE MATRIX AND THE INSTRUCTIONAL MODULES. PHASE I WILL PRODUCE AN EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN, A STRUCTURED FORMAT AND MATRIX TO IMPLEMENT THAT DESIGN AND ONE INTERACTIVE INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEODISC. THE MODULE WILL CONTAIN ONE OR MORE INTERACTIVE TEACHING AND TUTORIAL UNITS IN BASIC SCIENCE AND AN INTERACTIVE SEGMENT FOR SYSTEM FAMILIARIZATION AND USE. PROBABLE SUBJECTS FOR THE INITIAL INTERACTIVE VIDEODISC MODULE WILL BE HUMAN PARASITOLOGY, HUMAN VIROLOGY OR HUMAN GENETICS. THE FINAL COMPONENT DEVELOPED UNDER PHASE I WILL BE AN EVALUATION INSTRUMENT DESIGNED TO TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN, COURSE CONTENT, THE STRUCTURED FORMAT AND MATRIX AND THE DELIVERY SYSTEM INCLUDING HARDWARE AND COMPUTER SOFTWARE.",

A RELIABLE, LOW COST HIGH RESOLUTION TOFMS WOULD PERMIT MANY MORE RESEARCH LABORATORIES TO COMPETE MOREEFFECTIVELY IN RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND ANALYTICAL APPLICATIONS. THE SUCCESSFUL DEMONSTRATION OF A SINGLE STAGE VELOCITY COMPACTION TOFMS POINTS THE WAY FOR A MARKED IMPROVEMENT IN THE ATTAINABLE RESOLUTION BY THE TOF APPROACH. THE BASIC RELATIONS FOR THE FLIGHT-TIME TRAJECTORIES HAVE BEEN DERIVED FROM FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICAL LAWS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL EXTEND THESE RELATIONS TO A DUAL-STAGE VELOCITY COMPACTION CONFIGURATION FOR WHICH THE RESOLUTION [M/(DELTA)M FWHM] IS EXPECTED TO BE IN THE RANGE OF 10,000-50,000.

NATURAL TALUS SLOPES PROVIDE AN EXCELLENTPHYSICAL ANALOG TO THIS ARRANGEMENT OF MATERIALS AND STUDIESSHOW THE HYDROLOGICAL AND EROSIONAL RESPONSE OF TALUS MAY DEPEND UPON THE NATURE AND DISTRIBUTION OF FINE MATERIAL BENEATH THE ROCK COVER. THE RESULTS (SOSEDOV, 1974; YAIR AND LAVEE, 1976) INDICATE THAT TALUS CAN BE EITHER VERY STABLE OR HIGHLY ERODIBLE DUE TO REMOVAL OF FINE MATERIAL BY SUBSURFACE FLOW. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THIS FLOW CAN OCCUR ALONG THE INTERFACE BETWEEN THE ROCK COVER AND THE UNDERLYING FINE MATERIAL. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS DESIGNEDTO INVESTIGATE EXPERIMENTALLY THE NATURE OF SUBSURFACE RUNOFF GENERATION AND EROSION PROCESSES ON ROCK MULCH AND UNDERLYING SURFACES. DURING PHASE I, LABORATORY EXPERIMENTSWILL DETERMINE WHICH CHARACTERISTICS OF ROCK MULCH ARE IMPORTANT IN RUNOFF GENERATION AND SUBSURFACE EROSION. PHASE II WILL EXTEND THE STUDY TO A FIELD SITE, LOCATED ON URANIUM MILL TAILINGS IN WESTERN COLORADO, WHERE TEST PLOTS OF THE BEST AND WORST CASES, AS DETERMINED BY PHASE I,WILL BE EXAMINED USING A PORTABLE RAINFALL SIMULATOR.
