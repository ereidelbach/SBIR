        "abstract": "Global Aerospace Corporation is proposing to develop a totally new concept for latitude trajectory control system (TCS) for NASA\u2019s Ultra Long Duration (ULDB) Balloons. The advantages of the TCS concept are that it uses little power, operates at night, is lightweight, does not require detailed knowledge of the wind field, and allows the balloon to fly at a constant altitude. The TCS enables the balloon to avoid populous areas and hazards to payload recovery, reach desirable targets, steer around no-fly zones and select convenient landing sites. Currently, when a balloon deviates significantly from a desired flight path, cut down often occurs, sometimes before mission objectives have been met. With a TCS, fewer flights will be terminated early. Furthermore, it will be easier to obtain permission to launch since the planned flight path can be achieved in a greater range of conditions. No longer will balloons be at the mercy of the winds. ",

In Phase I, we will investigate the preparation and characterization of ferromagnetic particles whose surface is modified to achieve the desired characteristics, which depend on the directed energy application. The modified particles will be fully characterized in this preliminary effort to assess their suitability in this type of application.

Optimization of the technique will provide not only larger and better quality crystals for x-ray and gamma-ray detection but also an opportunity to develop efficient and more compact instruments and devices.  For example, it is estimated that successful completion of this research will result in a reduction of more than an order of magnitude in the number of crystals required for a PET instrument.  Furthermore, the new solvent can be applied to the growth of all REOP crystals, some of which have potential application as ultraviolet, visible, and infrared lasers or as polarizers and optical isolators.

Moreover, this Raman laser provides beam cleanup, efficiently converting and improving the spatial beam quality of the pump laser. The pump laser design is based on previous work at CTI and is a rugged, efficient design suited for pumping this SSRL. The architecture can also be modified to produce adaptive waveforms such as the pulse doublet, permitting microDoppler and wind measurement capability with the same transmitter and therefore multipurpose instrument capability. This program will tie together our experience in flightworthy lidar systems with recent advances in SSRLs.

The buffet problem occurs when vortices emanating from the leading-edge extension of a delta wing break down before reaching the vertical tails. The resultant Unsteady unbalanced loads on the vertical tails can cause premature fatigue failure. A variety of methods for controlling the buffet problem have been proposed, but none have been definitively demonstrated as being an optimal solution. The proposed effort will utilize a state-of-the-art multi-disciplinary computing environment (MDICE) to evaluate the efficacy of a variety of proposed buffet-control methodologies and to design the optimum methodologies under a variety of flight conditions. MDICE will be configured with a computational fluid dynamics module (CFDFASTRAN), a structure dynamics module, and a conservative-consistent technique for fluid-structure interfacing. A controls module will be added when necessary to model certain active control methodologies. The Phase I effort will demonstrate the feasibility of the computational environment for prediction and control of twin-tail buffet. In this effort, the twin-tail buffet responses of a generic fighter aircraft will be computed and validated against the available experimental data. The effort will then be extended to apply three basic flow control methods under a specified set of flight conditions. Under Phase II, the computational environment will be expanded by developing and evaluating the efficacy of a comprehensive set of flow and structure control methodologies for twin-tail buffet alleviation under a wide range of flight conditions. The resulting optimum methodology or combination of methodologies will then be applied to a real fighter aircraft, e.g. F/ A-18.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  MSE Technology Applications, Inc. (MSE), with United Technologies Research Center and HyperTech Concepts Company proposes to develop combine propulsion for a small reusable launch vehicle (RLV), known as the KLINtm Cycle, consisting of a thermally integrated deeply cooled turbojet and liquid rocket engine. The objective of this approach is to achieve a high pressure ratio in a simple, lightweight turbojet engine. The result is an exceptional engine thrust-to-weight ratio and improved specific impulse and mass fraction of the launcher. For a heavy launcher, the KLINtm Cycle promises RLV gross takeoff weight (GTOW) reduction by a factor of two with prospects of lower dry weight. If based on the FL-10 engine family, the KLINtm Cycle makes a small single-stage-to-orbit and two-stage-to-orbit RLV feasible and economically very attractive. Specific objectives of the initial portion of the study are to demonstrate: 1) the performance and mass of a KLINtm Cycle based on an existing rocket engine of the RL-10 family applied to a small RLV; 2) the advantages of integrating a KLINtm Cycle into a small RLV (50-100 ton of GTOW); 3) the core technology development program. The benefit to the Air Force is low life-cycle cost combined propulsion for a space plan which can double existing rocket propulsion capabilities by the year 2010.",

The effort will first identify candidate spectral bands/subbands for both missile threat warning and subpixel ground target detection applications. From these results, clutter rejection and subpixel target detection algorithms shall be defined. The best candidate algorithms will be further developed to enhance their performance for use as embedded algorithms in SOC's real-time hyperspectral imaging and multispectral data processor. Based upon the warning and reconnaissance sensor requirements, SOC will conduct a preliminary design of the Threat Warning and Reconnaissance Sensor (TWARS) which will include a common TWARS sensor or sensor modules plus the real-time HIS/multispectral data processor. The processor to be delivered as a Phase I option effort is a currently available real-time HIS processor developed by Surface Optics Corporation over the last seven years. The 1/3 Gbyte /sec throughput rate of the processor will easily support three spectral imaging sensor modules and can be readily expanded to process additional HIS/multispectral sensors at increased data rates. By building on Spectral Sciences, Inc. and Analytical imaging and Geoophysics decades of experience in spectra bands / subbands selection and algorithms development, and SOC's seven years experience in instrument and algorithm development in the HIS field, the proposed program will produce a new TWARS system of unsurpassed capability, with varied military and commercial applications.",

The concept is to adaptively block sources of bright light in a scene while allowing the light from dimly lit areas to pass through with relatively little attenuation. The technical approach, based on a prototype of a patented technology, is to image the scene with a low cost CMOS imaging sensor. After the scene is scanned, areas of high light intensity, compared to some threshold, are identifed and the 2-diminsional coordinates are transferred to an addressable lens. The lens, a light transmissive liquid crystal display with addressable pixels, is direced to blank out the areas in its array that correspond to the bright areas in the original scene. The effect is to eclipse the bright light sources in the scene while leaving the balance of the scene clear. The project will have the assistance of the Kent State Liquid Crystal Institute. NY State will be providing funding support for development of the CMOS imaging sensor by the Center for Advanced Technology in Sensor Systems and Technologies at SUNY Stony Brook.",

Our innovative strategy will therefore enhance the biodegradability and will also ensure that the gun plugs meets all the other property specifications. In Phase I, Triton will prepare ES-polyurethanes, optimize the performance level with respect to Naval Sea Systems Command Specifications, and produce prototype gun plugs. In the Phase II Program, we will optimize the ES-polyurethane formulation, and scale up to make full size gun plugs for the 5  barrel. Extensive mechanical and environmental testing will be performed on these prototypes.

        "abstract": "Not Available  The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of separating cruise missile class targets when there are multiple targets observed by the acoustic sensor. Several  programs (e.g., steelrattler, FASDR) have addressed the use of small, remotely deployed acoustic sensors for collecting early warning and rough track on cruise missiles. Typically, the quality of track expected is not precise enough for use as fire control data, but rather is useful to cue fire control sensors. Acoustic sensors in this role maximize the time available to engage targets and provide very early warning of impending attack. Field experimentation has indicated that using acoustic sensor data to develop tracks of single targets is feasible and practical [Ref: Steadman, R.,  Air Deliverable Acoustic Sensor (ADAS), Multi-Node Data Fusion for Tracking Fast Aerial Targets , Textron Systems Division Briefing, October 1996]. The problem that has not been adequately addressed is how to develop tracks of multiple targets (cruise missiles) from acoustic data. The proposed work will demonstrate that by implementing frequency domain signal processing techniques to time slices of the data, the variation in doppler characteristics from tow or several targets can be used to separate the signatures of multiple targets.",

Currently, there are no commercial computer aided design (CAD) tools available that incorporate the proper physics for designing quantum devices. In Phase I of the study an existing 1D steady-state quantum simulator, NEMO, will be enhanced to include small-signal AC analysis through S-parameter extraction for use in a circuit simulator. This effort will be performed in close collaboration with JPL and Raytheon, the original developers of the quantum simulator NEMO. The modified quantum simulator will be used for demonstration/validation studies on resonant tunneling diodes (RTDs). Also, a new CAD tool architecture will be designed for implementation in the Phase II effort. In the Phase I option drift-diffusion effects will be put in NEMO's contact models, and experimental measurements of RTDs will be carried out to validate the CAD tool. In Phase II the new architecture design will be implemented. The architecture will leverage existing grid generation, numerical solver, database, and GUI library technologies at CFDRC. The final CAD tool will be 2D/3D, steady-state/transient, allow for AC analysis, capable of S-parameter extraction, and coupled with an electronic hydrodynamic model. The completed cross-platform tool will have a new graphical front end to aid in mesh generation, problem set- up, execution, and analysis/visualization.",

The Navy has an immediate need for secondary batteries having energy densities superior to Ag/Zn cells. Given the high energy density of Ag/Zn chemistry, the Navy seeks alternative cathodes having theoretical energy densities in excess of 1500 Wh/kg. PolyPlus Battery Company is developing a battery based on the chemistry of lithium polysulfides. The reversible cell reaction is 2 Li + S = Li2S. The lithium polysulfide cathode has a gravimetric capacity of 1165 mAh/g and a nominal cell potential of 2.0 volts, giving a theoretical energy density of 2330 Wh/kg. The extremely high energy density of the Li/S system is 33 to 55% higher than that requested by the Navy. Furthermore, fully sealed, packaged 2 Ah cells tested at PolyPlus Battery Company's facility have demonstrated exceptionally high specific energies of 150 to 400 Wh/kg at moderate to low rate (C/3 to C/25). These cells have also demonstrated high power densities of over 800 W/kg at room temperature and over 1,000 W/kg (80 Wh/kg) at moderately elevated temperatures (60 \u00bfC).

For examples, resistive coatings can be used to heat an optical fiber, while piezoelectric coatings can be used to strain the fiber. Localized changes in the fiber waveguiding properties can be achieved by electrically activating the fiber coating. These coated fibers show promise for applications such as optical phase shifters, modulators and dynamic fiber Bragg gratings (DFBG) with tunable reflectivity. In this proposal, we will use the coating technique developed by NZ Applied Technologies (NZAT) to demonstrate high sensitive electric field fiber-optic sensors, by combining the advantages of fiber optic sensors with active thin films coatings.

Erbium-doped amplifiers have become well established in fiber form. However, their manufacture is today complex and costly. IFOS proposes to combine integrated-optic splitter fabrication with an innovative proprietary approach for manufacture of distributed photonic amplifiers.

In Phase II, we will demonstrate active-ridge-waveguides and then fabricate an optimized lossless splitters and begin commercialization activities.

Researchers in adult education and policymakers have recommended that new instructional technologies with their promise of increased efficiency be pursued. Like personal computers in the earlier part of this decade, the Internet holds much appeal to adult learners. Because of the Internet's inherent appeal, there is considerable potential for courseware products delivered over this medium to have a better chance of keeping students enrolled in the adult education program. In addition, the Internet offers students the opportunity to be connected via e-mail, chats and bulletin boards and the World Wide Web to tutors, teachers, other students and the world of information. If this project is funded, Interactive Knowledge intends to create a reading comprehension courseware model that can be delivered to students over the Internet. This model will be based on a successful CD-ROM courseware model that has already been developed, tested and marketed by Interactive Knowledge. Once the Internet courseware model is completed, it will be tested with adult students who function between the 5th and 8th grade reading level.",

These treatment technologies are potentially capable of eliminating sludge and producing an effluent suitable for overboard discharge. Under Phase I of this project, WASTECH proposes to design a prototype wastewater treatment system that will provide the most economical means of shipboard treatment of sewage and gray water for overboard discharge and/or reuse, as appropriate. WASTECH's treatment technology involves the microwave incineration of toilet solids, resulting in no sludge generation, as well as ceramic filtration of effluent to significantly reduce the suspended solids concentration in discharge effluent. In addition, WASTECH has developed complementary technologies to disinfect the effluent and reduce dissolved organic matter. It is expected that information obtained from Phase I will make it possible to design integrated wastwater treatment and management systems for all appropriate classes of Navy ships under SBIR Phase II and III.",

A design for a prototype, guided by error model analyses, will be developed in Phase I. The prototype proposed for fabrication and development in the Phase I option will be about 1.0  in diameter and 2.5  long, and will be tested and evaluated in a Helmholtz coil facility. In Phase II, the SMAC compass design will be optimized and, to the extent possible, implemented using integrated circuit technology to achieve both the performance goals and the cost goal of under $1,000 per unit.

Traditionally, the scaling of small-scale data to estimate prototype performance assumes that the major issue is the friction drag change with Reynolds number and usually for the hull alone. This process ignores important conditions, such as acceleration, deceleration and maneuver. The proposed Phase I effort will develop a computer-based process that consists of a series of existing boundary layer estimation codes whose physical modeling has been carefully validated. The feasibility of the process will initially be demonstrated by focusing on the scaling of friction drag. If successful, the process can be adapted to address pressure drag and lift. A  smart  process will be defined that applies the different boundary layer codes to the flow regime that they are best suited to model. This smart process will be used to post-process small-scale data to reflect the effects of boundary layer changes between small scale and prototype Reynolds numbers. With an accurate knowledge of both the small-scale and prototype boundary layers the prototype system performance can be confidently estimated.",

Our proposed approach to the development of the IHUT agents will provide for realistic representation of human movement through the simulated environment in real time, and reflect skill-based reactive behavior in that environment as well as higher level cognitive task behaviors of situation assessment and planning to accomplish key MOUT mission objectives.",

Specific avenues for the proposed research are: (1) Current COIL nozzles typically inject a mixture of diluent gas and molecular iodine into the subsonic region of the O (sub 2) ((sup 1) increment) flow upstream of the nozzle throat. The resulting mixing leads non-uniform loading on the laser mirrors and to a non-uniform gain distribution ('sugar-scooping'). 'Tuning' the mixing and chemical reactions with an improved nozzle design may solve this problem and may also yield higher laser efficiency. (2) In the COIL mixing process, a significant amount of the energy stored in the singlet-delta oxygen is required to dissociate the molecular iodine to atoms. Analysis indicates that 4-6 O (sub 2) ((sup1) increment) molecules are required per I (sub 2) molecule. Injection of atomic iodine may result in an overall more efficient COIL system. (3) Heat release in the flow, both in the laser and due to deactivation of excited species, has a deleterious effect on laser performance, as well as on pressure recovery. An improved supersonic nozzle will mitigate this effect.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  Intelligent Automation, Inc. proposes to develop the Team Readiness Assessment Program  (TRAP). TRAP will be an assessment tool to measure the effectiveness of training battle groups in the performance of mission essential tasks as individuals or as a team. TRAP will use Latent Semantic Analysis, a powerful new machine-learning technology, to provide a numerical index of the similarity between textual descriptions of tactics, tasks and other elements of task performance with a description of the trainee's decisions and response, with after-action reviews of training exercises, and with scenarios having desirable outcomes. The goal is to develop TRAP as a reliable method of assessing battle group readiness, and to aid in planning needed training programs. TRAP will enable the Navy to measure performance of trainees and effectiveness of training using LSA-based similarity metrics by matching descriptions of training exercise outcomes with descriptions of ideal outcomes, and by matching trainees' consideration of factors such as weather, sea state, relevant tactics and doctrine to experts. The numerical scores provided by these comparisons will be scaled along a continuum indicating the readiness of the individual or Battle Group to effectively plan and implement mission essential tasks. TRAP will enable trainees to receive real-time feedback on their decisions, and provide them with descriptions of choices that match more closely to optimal choices. TRAP will be designed for individual or group use, and for local as well as distributed training environments.",

Unfortunately, adverse environmental conditions in shallow water scenarios can degrade the performance of active sonar. Improved performance is possible, however, if the sonar system can adapt to its environmental conditions. New transducer technologies that offer both spectral and spatial adaptability promise superior detection capabilities. This proposal considers the novel application of arrays of flextensional type actuators, sandwiched between cover plates. This innovative combination of flextensional drive elements and mass loading by cover plates permits low-frequency operation from an extremely compact unit. This work effort will make extensive use of state-of-the-art transducer models and extensive design expertise to determine efficacy of the proposed technology and provide a rapid virtual prototyping capability. Different types of flextensional geometry, multilayered configurations and hybrid mixed-frequency devices will be considered. Experimental prototype fabrication and characterization will be used to demonstrate the validity of the hybrid finite element modeling strategy. The proposed approach holds great promise for a new level of performance and adaptability in a cost effective, compact and efficient unit.",

A typical transistor characteristic of drain current as a function of gate voltage for both dark current and for avalanche gain will be measured.

Using photonics for signal processing and computing holds promise for ultra-high bandwidth and speed, immunity to electromagnetic interference and crosstalk, freedom from impedance-matching problems, higher interconnect density and lower cost compared with their electronic counterparts. The proposed ultra-fast photonic processors are a first-time implementation with wavelength-division-multiplexed fiber-optic circuits in architectural configurations known as \u00bfsystolic\u00bf which are well-suited to our goal. Systolic processing provides a pipelined means for implementation of linear algebra, crucial in many signal-processing functions including those in radars. Because of increasing need for ultra-fast processors and recent advances in optical-fiber gratings, couplers and amplifiers, the time is ripe to move photonic systolic processing toward commercialization. The IFOS team is in a unique position to do this because of (a) its pioneering history in the subject, and (b) its recent related device technology advancements. In Phase I, IFOS will simulate, analyze, fabricate and test an expandable photonic systolic processor comprising three proprietary processing elements.

Select materials will than be synthesized and characterized electrochemically to determine which are most likely to yield the desired electrochemical properties. Success in the Phase I effort will lead to the development of a solid polymer electrolyte that is equal to liquid electrolytes and will mean a whole new era for lithium batteries in the consumer market.

This is a difficult problem for which existing solutions fall short of desired capabilities in terms of the efficient and practical integration of diverse components. We propose an innovative software based solution to integrate the ability to gather, display, record, process and playback multiple sources of real-time data. Our solution, based upon our  Ring Buffered Network Bus  (RBNB) technology, greatly improves the efficiency to the T&E analysis and reporting capabilities. Our innovation uses portable Java code and standard networking protocols for deployment on most modern computers, including cost effective PCs. It provides multi-input multi-output buffer(s) between data sources and destinations. This decouples connected applications, enabling time-synchronization of multiple real-time data sources, with simultaneous asynchronous data access from multiple on-line display and analysis stations. Merging time-synchronized data from multiple sources can occur in real-time or after the fact. Attached to an RBNB backbone, data acquisition and processing applications collaborate to provide high performance integrated systems. Enabling the interconnection of re-usable, modular legacy and custom components, our innovation greatly enhances the efficiency and performance of large scale data distribution systems.",

Fiber optic technology is employed extensively for an ever increasing array of commercial and military signal transmission, communications and control applications.  However optimum use of these fibers in these applications requires coating of these fibers with thin layers of various electronic materials such as semiconductors, insulators, metals and compounds. We propose to develop an innovative thin film fabrication deposition technology for coating advanced high technology electronic materials on optical fibers.  We will use a unique high throughput, in-line manufacturing system (recently developed for wear resistant diamond like carbon coating on bare optical fibers) for this development.  We will study the microstructure and nanostructure of various electronic materials deposited on optical fibers to analyze the effect of curved substrate on the film quality and its electronic properties.  We will demonstrate this technology by fabricating a very sensitive optical fiber magnetic sensor.  The proposing team, consisting of UHV Technologies, Drexel University and Sarnoff Corporation possesses unique capabilities to undertake this project",

The problem is motivated by the economic concerns associated with consolidation of satellite support network resources. The solution to this problem is extremely complex and requires juggling many different constraints and performance requirements. Herein is proposed the development of a set of genetic search algorithms for automatic near-optimal solution of this problem. Genetic search methods are a type of directed trial-and-error, and therefore, as they are not gradient-based, are ideal for optimization problems with complex or non-smooth constraints or performance measures. Development of these algorithms must be preceded by an in-depth analysis of the problem, during which factors and constraints relevant to antenna placement can be identified. Performance criteria for evaluation of the antenna/ground station configurations produced by the algorithms will also be defined. The algorithms developed will then be implemented and tested on a representative set of placement scenarios.",

Instead of using the shape, size, or direction of motion, we propose to use only the speed of the missiles to detect them.  Speed of a particular type of missile is a better known factor compared to its outward physical characteristics. Our approach will be based on the ongoing work at Tanner Research on low contrast point target detection (LCPTD), and the Wave Process, which has already shown great promise in the detection of cruise missiles from stationary sensor platforms.  We aim to extend this technology to detect cruise missiles from moving platforms. We will further enhance the Wave Process by developing a shape based detection method to improve the detection probability for low contrast targets, and provide the direction and speed of the target. We have already demonstrated an efficient analog VLSI implementation for the Wave Process, providing a high-performance signal processing component with low power, weight, and size, making it suitable for near-focal-plane applications. We will test and demonstrate these extended capabilities with synthetic IR focal plane data and a software simulation of the Wave Process.",

However, offsetting the many advantages of the AMB are its sensitivity to transient loads and the lack of a built in fail safe mechanism to capture the rotor and protect the FESS in the event of a system failure.  To meet this need MiTi has conceived and has tested two shock tolerant auxiliary bearings, the Zero Clearance Auxiliary Bearing (ZCAB) and the Powder Lubricated Auxiliary Bearing (P-LAB).  Each is suitable for high speed vacuum operation.  Under Phase I, MiTi will identify the design requirements for a vehicular class (e.g., the combat hybrid propulsion system) RESS shock tolerant auxiliary bearing designs to meet the design requirements, identify the required tribomaterial system (i.e, shaft material, bearing material and dry lubricant), select the bearing most suitable for Phase II demonstration and establish the development test rig concepts designs needed for Phase II.  Under Phase II, MiTi will complete the detailed design and fabricate the selected auxiliary bearing for development testing.",

TISI has developed and implemented such a scheme, known as Integrated Demodulation Navigation (IDN), which addresses robust carrier phase tracking in high Dynamics and blockage. In extending this development to the tactical jamming environment, specific challenges must be surmounted including estimation of signal amplitudes and compensation for deleterious amplitude and phase effects introduced by front-end spatial nulling. In its Phase I effort an enhanced amplitude estimation scheme for IDN will be developed, which will be evaluated in non-linear tracking simulations. TISI's simulator environment will be extended to include antenna pattern and vehicle blockage effects, as well as multiple jammer sources. A simplified model of spatial nulling disturbances will also be introduced. In preparation for RF testing of a prototype receiver in Phase II, MacAulay-Brown will develop a virtual GPS receiver environment concept for capture and playback of actual jammer and spatial pre-filtering scenarios produced by the AWFS. Finally, TISI will identify and compare options for implementing IDN in the GRAM-SAASM framework.",

To address this issue, CTI proposes a unique, modular optical waveguide amplifier (WGA) based transmitter which can be adapted to coherent and direct detection transceivers over a wide range of repetition rates and average powers. When compared to traditional lasers, the WGA has many exceptional properties: (1) compact, light weight, efficient, and highly manufacturable; (2) distributed thermal load that does not introduce serious optical distortions and allows passive conduction cooling; (3) mechanically flexible similar to fibers, but preserving spatial/spectral coherence and polarization; (4) each module is potentially scalable to kilowatts of cw power or tens of millijoules pulsed output; (5) geometry amenable to being pumped by high power laser diode arrays with minimal coupling optics. The WGA is ideal for eye-safe, multi-function, space-based and tactical airborne LADAR where resources are at a premium. This novel waveguide design is radically different from standard waveguide and fiber designs and will find wide commercial applicability and provide a path to multidiscriminant remote sensing modules.

The transistor  is an important device mainly because it can amplify a weak signal. Theoretical estimates of the gain from present single-electron transistors show that, under optimistic conditions, the maximum gain is on the order of 10. Furthermore gain is only possible over a narrow range of input voltage. It was recently demonstrated that a controllable saturated tunneling current is available in a degenerate p-n junction.

Using the unique ability of the virtual environment to present complex multi-dimensional and multivariate data (such as FEA output files) in an intuitive format tailored to user needs, this tool allows a person to observe and quickly comprehend the effects of a weapon impact on a simulated ship, aircraft or land- based target. Traditional methods using raw FEA data to describe weapons damage are cumbersome for typical users to employ. The Virtual Environment for Weapons Effects Visualization (VEWEV) tool enables a person to observe weapon penetration, fragmentation, stress, and heat distribution via three dimensional deformational presentations of external and internal views of the target. These views are augmented with color coded stress gradients, and a capability for specialized graphical displays to provide supplementary information in a format meaningful to the user. The virtual environment provides the observer with a unique ability to navigate into and through a structure, and to perceive details and data unavailable with any other inspection method.",

The key to the fidelity of any simulation is the quality of the underlying aerodynamic database, and while it is relatively straightforward to collect the initial data required for such a database, it is often the case that, during flight tests, the aircraft behaves different than predicted. In these situations, it is desirable to update the simulation data based on information gathered during actual flight tests. The proposed research will address two significant issues related to database updating: (1) how to properly structure the flight-data identification problem to allow identification of aerodynamics that may be nonlinear functions of the independent variables, and (2) how to convert the information obtained from flight-test analysis into a form suitable for use in a simulation. The resulting algorithms and software tools will be applicable in any field where one maintains data related to system behavior and wishes to use real-time experiments to revise these data. Such systems occur in diverse fields ranging from chemical process control to medical prognostics to fraud detection.",

They will allow considerable cost and performance flexibility, e.g. modifications such as the substitution of higher performance fibers, altering the spacing array and/or fiber tow size, addition of densification process cycles, etc. will enable the manufacture of higher grade multidimensional C/C. Carbon fiber preform fabrication and densification currently account for 50% and 25% respectively of the cost of multidimensional C/C so they will be the major focus of cost reduction efforts. Recent programs at FMI have resulted in substantial incremental reduction in the costs of these processes. The proposed program will depart from traditional processing techniques in addition to building on the results of these programs. Phase I efforts will demonstrate the considerable cost benefits of these novel processes and confirm the C/C produced meets the mechanical and thermal properties required by the solicitation.

Integrating the PSPS with a Hall effect thruster creates an optimized thruster and pointing system for small lightweight satellites (MicroSats and NanoSats). Hall effect thrusters offer significant performance advantages for satellite orbit insertion, orbit transfer, station keeping, attitude control, and de-orbiting.

        "abstract": "Not Available  In high heat flux applications, typical regeneratively-cooled combustion chambers have very high pressure drops which significantly increase the demands on turbomachinery. These high pressure drops are largely due to high coolant velocities in the regen circuits caused by the use of low-aspect ratio coolant channels (4:1). In addition, low aspect ratio coolant lines cannot be tailored to optimize heat transfer throughout the regen circuit, this results in overcooling near the injector and nozzle exit. Adopting coolant channels with higher aspect ratios (15:1 instead of 4:1) would significantly reduce the pressure drop of the combustion chamber. However, in high aspect ratio channels, flow stratification causes heated coolant to stay near the hot gas wall, resulting in higher wall temperatures, reduced cycle life, and potential chamber failure. Flow stratification must be understood and eliminated if higher aspect ratio cooling channels are to become a practical technology. This effort will develop a theoretical model of flow stratification and a methodology for its mitigation in coolant channels by: 1) performing combined CFD/Heat Transfer analyses of channels with various aspect ratios to obtain an initial assessment of flow stratification, 2) anchoring the numerical results with experimental testing, and 3) developing technologies to mitigate the stratification of the coolant in the channels.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  This proposal encompasses a reinforcement alternative to steel rebars that are deteriorating due to corrosion on waterfront constructions. Fiber reinforced polymer reinforcing has been used in the past decade as it offers great potential for use in concrete construction under conditions in which conventional steel reinforced concrete has yielded unacceptable service. A new carbon composite reinforcement concept for use in conventional reinforced and prestressed concrete structures is developed in this proposal. This design concept mitigates the problems associated with the FRP reinforcements presently used. The non-corroding characteristics of the CFRP reinforcement can significantly enhance the structural performance of concrete waterfront structures and increase the service life of the constructions. The reinforcement design proposed involves innovative materials and fabrication technologies. The proposed reinforcement concept will increase bond strength with concrete and provide high tensile strength and stiffness to the concrete structure. The new concept will reduce maintenance costs and construction time. The feasibility and cost effectiveness of the proposed design has also been addressed.",

In Phase I, we plan to scale-up the deposition process for 0.5 ft. x 0.5 ft. area cell fabrication. Deposition conditions will be optimized to achieve high cell performance and uniformity over large areas. Achievement of a highly reproducible process that produces 0.5 ft. x 0.5 ft. modules on kapton substrates with efficiencies greater than 8% will be achieved during the Phase I program.

Onboard de-icing systems are effective but are applied to larger aircraft, not small and/or commuter aircraft and helicopters. What is needed is an onboard means for pilots to observe, in a timely manner, whether conditions ahead of the aircraft represent an icing hazard, so that evasive action can be initiated. A key component of icing prediction is the ability to remotely measure cloud region temperature to an accuracy sufficient to determine if the temperature is in the range of 0 degrees to -10 degrees Celsius, i.e. is in the liquid water super cooled region. Technology Service Corporation has developed a radar-based concept that promises to remotely determine a range resolved measure of the temperature in a cloud region. The method is an extension of the well known two-frequency radar method of remotely measuring cloud Suspended Liquid Water Content, that is another key component of icing prediction. The new temperature measuring method can use the same radar equipment as the two-frequency method. It should also be possible to integrate the new method with existing A/C weather radars.  BENEFITS:  If successful this technique, when integrated with a radar system that otherwise remotely measures cloud liquid water content, will provide a self contained sensor system that will accurately predict icing hazard conditions ahead of an aircraft.

This program will demonstrate an enabling technology, intersubband transitions in AlyGa1-yN/GaN multiple quantum wells (MQWs), that will permit the construction of terabit/sec switches at telecommunication wavelengths. The ultra-fast nature of the intersubband transition (~80 fs) is approximately three orders of magnitude faster than the carrier lifetime, and the wide band gap of the nitride materials offer advantages that make similar intersubband devices constructed out of other material systems impractical. All of these transitions and devices discussed are viable at room temperature.  The thrust of this Phase I proposal is to validate the materials science that will enable the above technological applications.  The proposed growth method for these structures, Atomic Layer Epitaxy (ALE), has distinct advantages over other more standard growth methods, including precision control of layer thickness and uniformity.  Upon verification of the optical properties, optical switches will then be fabricated and characterized.

In Phase I, we will design an intelligent CIC watch station automation system which includes a general CIC knowledge representation schema, investigate the knowledge required for several watch stations, implement a limited prototype CIC knowledge representation and execution system, and implement three limited automated watch station prototypes for different CIC positions using the schema",

        "abstract": "Not Available  Use of fine evaporating water sprays directly injected into the inlet of a gas turbine have been shown to provide significant increases in power production in land-based applications. By providing evaporative cooing inside the compressor, the sprays act an an  in-situ intercooler  to reduce the amount of work required to compress the air flow. The increased mass flow from the injected water also serves to increase the power delivered by the expander sections of the turbine. The diameter of the water droplets in the sprays are a critical factor in determining the impact on gas turbine performance. Smaller droplets evaporate faster and are more likely to follow the streamlines of the flow. Further, smaller droplets serve to decrease the potential for droplets impacting the compressor blades and causing erosion. A recently developed spray technology, swirl-flash nozzles, shows promise of yielding droplet diameters an order of magnitude smaller than standard high pressure nozzles can currently deliver. The proposed work will evaluate the impact of using standard spray nozzles, as well as swirl-flash spray injection on a Navy LM2500 gas turbine. The cost and performance of these options will be compared to other water and steam injection power augmentation techniques. In addition, the constraints imposed by shipboard installation will be examined to determine the feasibility of using this technology in a Navy ship.",

One of the grand challenges in HLA stems from the desire to represent large-scale operations in a single simulation and yet retain the ability to investigate certain aspects of the battle space in greater detail. In order to link simulations implemented at substantially different levels of resolution, a multi-resolution mapping framework is needed. Spectra Research, Inc. (S*R) and Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) propose to prototype a Multi-Resolution Mapping Framework (MRMF) tool and demonstrate it with a HLA toolsuite called Federate Connect. Federate Connect is under development to map the source code of a simulation to an HLA object model, build a Simulation Object Model, and generate a HLA compliant federate including middleware to connect to the HLA Run-time Infrastructure. The proposed MRMF tool will replace a simpler Object Model Resolver tool included in Federate Connect. By building on this existing baseline, we will be able to focus on developing a very robust MRMF in Phase II. The MRMF will be compatible with the evolving Joint Simulation System and Joint Modeling and Simulation System implementation.",

VGMR memory technology enables ultra-high density storage capability which is predicted to surpass DRAM. Unlike DRAM, however, VGMR MRAM (magnetoresistive random access memory) is nonvolatile, meaning it retains its state even without power. In order to fully exploit the benefits of this emerging technology, it will need to be implemented using high density silicon electronics. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of building the VGMR memory the following four objectives will be met: a) identify vertical memory specifications and constraints; b) identify memory array and integrated circuit process limitations; c) design vertical memory architecture; and d) design vertical memory circuitry. With the close of the Phase I effort, NVE will have completed a preliminary VLSI circuit design, predicted device performance and yield requirements, and outlined a process for fabricating integrated VGMR memory arrays. Under Phase II, VGMR arrays will be tested and debugged using multi-chip integrated prototypes followed by fabrication and demonstration of single chip VGMR arrays fully integrated with silicon-based VLSI electronics.",

Therefore we propose to produce large bulk single crystals of gallium nitride by starting with perfectly lattice-matched LiGaO2 substrates and utilizing the rapid growth rated affordable by halide vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE).  Anticipated growth rates will be 50 to 100 microns per hour.  First a thin buffer layer of GaN will be grown by MOCVD on the new LiGaO2 substrates to guard against corrosion by HC1.  Our new hybrid MOCVD/HVPE reactor will allow all processing to be performed in on cycle.  The oxide substrates will subsequently be removed by wet chemical etching, leaving large area free standing wafers of gallium nitride.  Such wafers will be made available commercially by Crystal Photonics Inc for homoepitaxial growth of gallium nitride films.  With a conducting substrate, present device contacting problems will be eliminated.  Very low defect densities will induce high power densities in blue diode lasers.  In Phase I, we shall prepare blue GaN light-emitting diodes on our new wafers to demonstrate their utility.  Lasers will be produced during Phase II",

The overall goal of this program is to develop such a tool by combining state-of-the-art analysis methods with an extensive test database in order to generate certifiable strength and fatigue life predictions of rotorcraft joint configurations and loading conditions. For Phase I and Phase I Option, NSE Composites Stress Services (NSE) is teamed with members of the rotorcraft industry (Bell, Boeing Helicopter, and Sikorsky) to identify candidate joints that have potentially high payoff as bonded joint redesigns. NSE and its research consultants will conduct state- of-the-art strength and fatigue analyses on selected configurations. NSE's hybrid analytical approach is based on a strength-of-materials approach to determine damage initiation, and a fracture mechanics approach to assess damage progression. Accumulation of damage due to fatigue spectra will also be predicted. The Phase I and Phase I Option results will be: a detailed definition of candidate joints, a preliminary evaluation of the selected analytical approach, a preliminary Phase II test matrix, and a flowchart of the software to be developed in Phase II.

Unfortunately, however, there is the potential for extremely high noise levels inside the vehicle cabin. This noise, possibly exceeding 120 dBA, requires individual hearing protection and makes speech communication inside the vehicle nearly impossible. CSA Engineering proposes to develop a hybrid passive-active noise suppression system for the Advanced Amphibious Assault Vehicle. This hybrid system, combining passive and active elements and inherent to the vehicle, will provide global noise reduction inside the vehicle cabin, making protective headsets unnecessary and facilitating verbal communication. Once the system requirements and constraints have been established, the suitability of a number of passive and active acoustic suppression techniques will be assessed. The best performing passive and active techniques will be combined in a preliminary design. A structural-acoustic simulation of the vehicle response including the disturbance sources will be used to evaluate performance levels of the noise suppression design. The predicted attenuation levels, weight, power, and the physical practicality of the design will be used as the metric in evaluating the design.",

ELI proposes to develop high quality InSb on Si epitaxial wafers for large area InSb and HgCdTe based IRFPAs. ELI will apply a novel approach to incorporate a new composition graded buffer layer (CGBL)on Si substrate to reduce/eliminate the threading dislocation in the thin InSb epilayers grown on top of the CGBL. In phase I, design and  growth of novel buffers will be carried out,  and high quality InSb thin epiwafer will be demonstrated. The optimization of the CGBL and production of high quality Si based InSb epiwafers will be realized in phase II",

(NEA) is a manufacturer of electro-mechanical products, specializing in the development of innovative hold down and release mechanisms for the aerospace industry. NEA has designed and manufactured two prototype release mechanisms with unique capabilities. The Model 9111 rod release mechanism is simple, highly reliable, light weight and cost effective. It is capable of restraining up to 2500 lbs. of tension and releasing the load instantaneously upon electrical command. The source shock output is extremely low (less than 500 g,s) at the 2500 lb. preload. The model 9111 weighs 80 grams. The Model VBRM 2500 is an electrically and mechanically redundant release mechanism. This mechanism is designed to restrain a V-Band or marmon clamp up to a rated tensile load of 2000 pounds. Upon electrical command, the V-Band separates, nearly instantaneously, to allow the two restrained structures to separate. Prototypes of each mechanism have been built and preliminary testing has shown that these devices meet technical requirements. NEA is proposing to conduct additional development testing over a range of environment parameters simulating launch and space. Numerous customers and programs have shown interest in these products. The test results are intended to validate the products design, leading to qualification testing.",

The Marine Collision Avoidance Sonar (MARCAS) is based on a small size, retractable sparse planar array using a minimal number of commercial off-the-shelf transducers. The MARCAS provides both high vertical and high horizontal resolution over a wide aperture to provide AAAVs' drivers with WideViewTM detection without any moving parts. WideViewTM is important because drivers must make navigation decisions not only based on forward obstacles but also on potential obstacles on either side (similar to changing lanes on a highway). Thanks to the high vertical angular resolution and because of shallow water operation, the MARCAS will discern direct-paths from multipaths (reverberation) and differentiate obstacles above and below the 20-foot  safety-depth . Finally, the MARCAS is stealthy because it uses GORCA Technologies' proprietary concept, BiopulseTM, which is coded copies of naturally occurring biological transient pulses such as shrimp sounds. The broadband frequency content of these coded pulses drastically limits shallow water propagation interference and allows detection over a range of 400m. This distance represents the  safety cushion  that gives the AAAV driver approximately 30 seconds to avoid obstacles.",

Practical application of this technique for collision avoidance requires development and integration of a compact, rugged configuration that can provide high resolution imaging over a wide swath from a maneuvering platform, with sufficient standoff range to allow the operator to avoid the detected obstacle. Arete Associates has developed a novel 3-D Imaging LIDAR system, the Streak Tube Imaging LIDAR (STIL) which can provide high resolution imaging at significant standoff ranges. The patented STIL approach is based on application of mature technologies, and has been demonstrated in the laboratory, ship-based experiments, and airborne demonstrations. STIL uses fan beam illumination, push broom imaging, and electrostatic sweep to generate high resolution images with no moving parts, yielding a rugged compact configuration for vehicle integration. Arete proposes to directly demonstrate STIL for obstacle detection at near grazing incidence by adapting and utilizing existing, proven hardware for a cost-effective Phase I concept validation. Prototype system development will follow in Phase II, and include detailed design, fabrication, integration, and demonstration of a deployable configuration for vehicle mounted obstacle detection.",

It may also be used for process control applications such as remote monitoring of parameters like the chemical composition or congealing of material in the casting process, or controlling fabrication of composites and fiber embedded materials. Another use can be nondestructive inspection of commercial and military energetic materials, munition items. It may also be applied for accurate determination of material properties. Medical uses are also possible, for example, in bone densitometry for osteoporosis diagnosis. During Phase I, a feasibility study will be carried out to demonstrate that the proposed detector will perform to the required specifications. During Phase II, a fully functional prototype detector system will be manufactured using the Phase I results. In Phase III, the detector system will be manufactured as a commercial hyperspectral x-ray-imaging instrument.  BENEFITS:  The results of the Phase I and II programs will be a fast, high-accuracy room-temperature hyperspectral imaging x-ray detector system. This detector has many application capabilities for both the military and commercial sectors.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  Reveo, Inc. has invented a proprietary low cost pigment technology having the unprecedented quality that it can be designed to be highly reflective at any wavelength in the range of less than 300 nm to more than 3000 nm with a reflective bandwidth in the range of less than 40 nm to more than 1000 nm. Outside the reflective band, the material is transparent. This novel material, based on cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs), is uniquely capable of defeating advanced battlefield detection technology that utilizes multispectral and hyperspectral detection schemes. These schemes involve detecting a combination of specific visible and near-infrared wavelengths that are characteristic of manmade objects but distinct from foliage, thereby defeating all attempts at broadband camouflage. Defeating these detection schemes while maintaining the visible and infrared camouflage that disrupts casual battlefield visibility is presently nearly impossible. Reveo proposes to adapt its unique, spectrally-designable pigment technology to the specific narrow-band and multi-band spectral requirements of next-generation military camouflage in the visible and near-infrared.  This technology can also simultaneously defeat polarization-based detection schemes. Reveo has extensive experience in designing variable wavelength and bandwidth CLC films and has developed a proprietary process for fabricating pigments from CLC film materials.

Initial application to manportable sensors is envisioned with straightforward extension to other platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles where size and weight are critical design factors. The tuner will utilize simple opto-mechanical assemblies and control electronics and it will be applicable to wavelength shifting in the 3-5 and 8-12 micron bands at a shift rate of at least 50 Hz. The main objective of the Phase I effort is to demonstrate wavelength shifting accuracy and repeatibility as a basis for the Phase IT effort under which a prototype unit will be developed and delivered. BENEEFITS:  The proposed tuner is a critical component of chemical and biological agent standoff sensors that would provide the military with a much needed capability.

        "abstract": "Not Available  Laser weapon systems currently under development, such as the Airborne Laser (ABL), must successfully fire laser beams over long horizontal paths through the atmosphere. Pointing the laser to hit the target in this scenario requires compensation for at least three effects: 1) target motion; 2) weapon platform motion; and 3) atmospheric turbulence effects. Pointing errors arising from atmospheric turbulence effects are random, and sensing these errors poses unique difficulties. Propagation over a long path causes the atmospheric induced phase errors to be converted into amplitude errors, which we refer to as scintillation. A potential solution to the problem of target tracking under conditions of strong scintillation is to use phase unwrapping techniques to reconstruct an estimate of the phase of the incident field which accounts for the discontinuities arising from branch points. Recent work in two-dimensional phase unwrapping techniques has shown that if the aperture is appropriately sampled by a Hartmann sensor, then it is possible to reconstruct the actual phase of the incident field. Under this program we propose to implement the latest phase unwrapping and branch point reconstruction problem, and use these new approaches to determine the optimal pointing angle for a laser beam.",

State-of-the-art passive damping treatments, while effective, are limited to temperatures below 500 degrees F and to static structures. The needs and environment posed by gas turbine engines far exceed the limitations of the available viscoelastic damping treatments. MiTi has conceived a powder structural damping approach that is insensitive to temperature and accounts for the high centrifugal loads encountered in rotating airfoils. Initial powder damping feasibility has been demonstrated and powder material damping characteristics are being experimentally determined. Transfer of this new technology to practical applications requires evaluation in structural elements to verify the proposed design stategies. In support of this program and to ensure technology transfer to product, major engine company support has been obtained. Specific objectives of this program are to 1) develop a high temperature powder damping design methodology for both rotating and static structural elements, 2) design and build a powder damped cantilever beam test specimen using powder material damping data presently being acquired under Air Force sponsorship, 3) fabricate the cantilever beam test specimen and demonstrate the effect of powder damping in controlling blade vibratory response, and 4) prepare a preliminary design of a simulated blade for detailed static and rotating verification testing",

The guidance system usually consists of a moderate field of view (FOV), moderate resolution optical system. The fusing system usually covers a significantly larger FOV at coarser resolution. A  hand-off' or cueing from guidance to fusing is required. In addition, while some research has been implemented toward utilizing domes with aerodynamic shapes, little implementation has taken place. OPTICS 1 proposes the use of a single zoom optical system for both guidance and fusing, eliminating the need for multiple optical systems and saving system cost and complexity. Such an optical system, if used with newly developed  foveal vision  focal plane arrays (FPAs) and on-chip signal processing, can likely perform all of the functions of the currently implemented systems. This technology, combined with aerodynamic dome shapes will allow operation over the existing flight envelopes of today's missiles with a single optical system. In this phase of the program, OPTICS 1 will leverage from work performed under previous programs including F08630-98-C-0022 (wide angle and zoom IR optics) and F08630-91-C-005 1 (aerodynamic dome shapes).

The technique can be used to determine the resin cure state, detect pre-damage bond quality and sense or quantify damage in the material during use. Because the sensors are very lightweight, robust, and inexpensive, they can be readily located at critical points over an entire structure. The sensors may be either integrated into the material or surface bonded.  The technique will yield significant value to both military and commercial structures. The detection / inspection method utilizes small, robust piezoceramic impedance sensors in conjunction with a portable impedance analyzer.  Material structural integrity, cure state of the resin system, and degradation in the material due to damage is sensed using very accurate measurement of the local dynamic response.  The technique uses measurements of local dynamic response to sense changes in the mass, stiffness, or damping at the bond or joint around the bond. These measurements correlate with the structural state. With the sensors in place, the structure can be inspected quickly and easily. A single, untrained person can simply monitor a portable meter with an algorithm for determining cure, joint quality or material structural integrity changes.",

Two approaches, both based on optically excited fluorescence from the sensors, will be evaluated. Data will be obtained in the Phase 1 program to enable the selection of one of the approaches for further development. Preliminary investigations will also be conducted to optimize the fabrication procedure for the sensor's probe. The sensor will be shock resistant, minimally intrusive, immune to electromagnetic interference, and not sensitive to the configuration of the system to be diagnosed. It will have submillimeter spatial resolution and the ability to operate in a fluid environment. The Phase I work will result in a baseline design for a prototype of the temperature measurement system.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  Current systems that observe and detect changes from information gathered by a single sensor have limited success in dynamic scenarios.  The fusion of information from desperate sources such as SAR and IR in conjunction with Object Level Change Detection offers the potential for improved performance in terms of reduced false alarms.  This is primarily due to the complementary information across the two sensing domains and the differences in the source of false alarms.  The incorporation of model-based processing into the processing chain will provide the capability to accommodate normal signature variations in sensor, and object masking effects.  The overall goal of the proposed effort is to develop a robust process that detects changes at the object level.  The developed change detection process will fuse IR and SAR sensor data at the feature level and will also provide the mechanism to incorporate other imagery sources including spectral data.  It will complement ongoing fusion technologies currently developed under the DDB program.  The proposed fusion will be performed at multiple stages of the exploitation chain and will take advantage of mode-based processing to improve system robustness.  The feasibility of the developed technology will be demonstrated using sample data.  We will show the potential for improved false alarm reduction over current capabilities.",

The proposed software tool will combine a landscape model that predicts changes in the structure of a species' habitat, with a spatially structured, stochastic metapopulation model that estimates the extinction risk of the species. Such a tool will enable more realistic evaluation of the conservation practices and management options, such as schedule and type of timber harvest, design of nature reserves, reintroductions and translocations. It will also enable more accurate assessment of the impact of human activities (such as forestry practices, road building, agricultural expansion, and dam construction) on the fate of endangered and threatened species. The research will involve developing, integrating and testing algorithms for producing, exporting and interpreting habitat maps and for building models for species which live in multiple patches that change through time, such as in fragmented habitats.",

While fiber-based CPA systems have been reported previously, effort has mainly centered on operation at 1550nm using erbium-doped fibers and output energies in these systems have been limited to microjoules.

The protein is 500 to 2000 times sweeter than sucrose and has the functional characteristics, such as taste and stability, required to be a leading commercial sweetener. Expression of the Brazzein gene in maize should yield the equivalent \u00bf ton of sugar per ton of maize, providing the basis for a range of economical high and low intensity sweeteners with benefits to agriculture, the food industry and the consumer. ProdiGene has the technical capability to develop commercial maize varieties for the production of the Brazzein sweetener. Commercial success requires the achievement of relatively high levels of Brazzein expression in maize. Research conducted during Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of maize for Brazzein production, resulting in levels of Brazzein in excess of 0.8% of total soluble protein. Phase II research will seek to enhance these levels using a variety of promoters, targeting signals and gene modifications. In addition, process technology will be developed and evaluated to mill, extract and purify Brazzein from maize, and purified Brazzein will be used in taste tests to determine the most suitable formulations for commercial applications.",

Similar to a bi-metallic strip, this sensor consists of a thin beam of a substrate material with a thin wafer of piezoelectric material bonded to one side, and a thin wafer of magnetostrictive material bonded to the other.  When the sensor is exposed to a magnetic field, the magnetostrictive material will strain thereby forcing the entire structure to bend. The bending will result in induced strain in the piezoelectric material and an induced voltage field across the piezoceramic. The induced strain on the piezoelectric material will generate a measurable potential across the poling axis of the piezoceramic, which will be proportional to the magnitude of the magnetic field.  The sensor itself will require no external power to produce a signal.  The proposed sensor will be reliable, possess no moving parts, small, rugged, and inexpensive when produced in large quantities",

In addition, to it's historically strong reputation in the theoretical arena, the Optical Sciences Company conceived, fabricated and delivered the NOP Adaptive Optics System. This experience will ensure that the algorithms developed under this effort are practical, easily implementable in existing hardware, and relevant to ABL and other programs that must deal with strong scintillation. A key feature of the proposed effort is that we believe that we have developed a concept that can improve the Strehl ratio by a factor of 2 when strong scintillation is present. In addition to benefiting ABL, this algorithm will find applications in extending the workable region of the sky for astronomy and commercial laser communication applications.",

We further propose to fabricate two such external laser modulators to integrate into a dual-parallel laser modulator with extraordinarily large dynamic range. These antenna remoting links in the 44-100 GHz frequency range will use fiber optic transmission facilities that must handle microwave carrier-based digital modulation schemes requiring very high modulator linearity to minimize the interference that results from spectral regrowth. Use of a single laser and high dynamic range electrooptic modulator capable of covering the entire spectrum to 130 GHz rather than multiple laser and modulators that cover a fraction of the frequency range will greatly lower the cost for such applications. Very important immediate application of low cost to manufacture RF photonic laser modulators include remoting of antennas for cellular and micro-cellular radio systems for use in military and commercial applications, all of which are part of TACAN'' present and continuing marketing and sales agenda. Of particular commercial interest are space-based and airborne platforms such as true time delay beam formation and beam steering subsystems in phased array antennas. We are also now developing and marketing antenna downlinks from L-Band through Ka-band up to 47 GHz.",

Semiconductor industry trends are leading power levels, lower, but not quickly enough to meet the needs of advanced missions or the new generation of broad-band communications satellites. Commercial electronics, while trending to lower power levels, do not include mechanisms to mitigate against the effects of space radiation. This is an increasingly severe problem in space as SEU effects are enhanced by smaller geometries. The goal of this SBIR is to demonstrate radiation tolerant, ultra low power VLSI combining breakthrough techniques in ultra low power with SEU mitigation techniques using commercial processes. This activity leverages on an ultra low power technology demonstration program (CULPRiT) that is being undertaken under sponsorship of DoD. CULPRiT will produce CMOS technology that operates at supply voltages near 0.25 volts. A 400 fold reduction in power levels is realized in comparing 5 and 0.25 volt processes in digital electronics. Specifically, this SBIR proposes to demonstrate a RT version of a ULP circuit combining ULP and RT technologies for space use.",

For the first time, this material system permits the fabrication of efficient UV solid state sources that can be coupled to phosphors for saturated visible color and white light generation. While the operation efficiency of these UV-LED sources can be high, the total lumen output is limited because typical LED operation is in the milliwatt regime. Conventional LED fabrication technologies lead to applications requiring hundreds if not thousands of LED chips to produce high lumen output. This proposal will explore the development of advanced UV-LED designs for operation at high current (power) operation for high lumen output. This will be accomplished by developing alternate growth technology on thick GaN/sapphire substrates which can be thinned to remove the sapphire, thus improving thermal management and light extraction for high efficiency, high lumen output.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  In distributed command and control applications, video can provide significant help in terms of interpersonal communications, intelligence gathering, resource management, and other military functions. However, the available bandwidth is very limited in battlefield that necessitates the use of video compression. Current standards such as MPEG-1 (Motion Pictures Experts Group) can only achieve a compression ratio of 400, i.e. from 472 Mbps to 1.2 Mbps. There are I (Intracoded), P (Predictive), B (Bidirectional), and D (DC-coded) frames in MPEG-1. Although D-frames are not necessary for military application since they are mainly used for fast-forward function in VCRs.  Thus one can eliminate D-frames to save some bandwidths. This is still not enough. The aim of this Phase 1 research is to develop a new technique that can achieve a compression ratio of 1000:1 so that it is feasible to use video in military command and control applications.  Here Intelligent Automation Incorporated (IAI) and Boston University propose a new overlapping block transform based wavelet coder (OBTWC) to compress video images.  The objective is to reduce the transmission time without sacrificing too much the performance of the image quality. Wavelet technology is a promising technique for image compression. Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) has adopted a Wavelet Scalar Quantization technique to compress all fingerprints in its headquarter in Washington DC. FBI's technique achieves compression ratio of 18:1. We have applied our proposed new technique to fingerprint image compression. Our approach can achieve 26:1 with the same quality as the FBI coder. Therefore, we strongly believe that our algorithm can achieve 1000:1 compression ratio if we replace the DCT coding scheme in MPEG-1 by our OBTWC scheme.",

By utilizing RBD's expertise with SEDRIS and Internet-based SEDRIS applications, a software architecture will be designed to address the conversion of correlated terrain databases for use in Computer Generated Forces tCGF) systems. Use of SEDRIS and the plugin-based format conversion architecture developed by RBD will provide a single conversion application to perform all CGF database conversion tasks. Different formats will be supported via the use of Dynamic Link Libraries, making the conversion software extensible and provide a future growth path. The conversion software will be accessed via a Web-based interface and support access to CGF databases accessible over the Internet as well as private Intranets. The software package will support a variety of input and output formats. A SEDRIS based correlation test tool will also be developed to verify the integrity of terrain geometry and feature topology.

Unfortunately, plume signature modeling has proven to be extremely difficult, with modelers struggling to obtain good agreement between predictions and data. The modeled exhaust conditions display a significant lack of fidelity as compared to the actual constituents exiting the engine. In particular, soot concentration, which as a continuum radiator in the IR spectrum is extremely important to good signature prediction, varies considerably within the plume because it is dependent upon the soot producing, fuel-rich regions in the exhaust. Fuel-rich regions have proven especially difficult to model. Johnson Rockets, along with the Naval Postgraduate School, has been developing methods for accurately predicting soot concentrations in exhaust plumes. Expansion of this work will vastly increase both the modeling capabilities of the chemical kinetics of hydrocarbon combustion and our understanding of O/F variation in the combustion chamber. Increasing our modeling capabilities with respect to these combustion phenomena will provide methods for predicting soot production that are essential for plume recognition modeling",

This approach can greatly increase the potential for mission success while reducing the size and weight of the system.  Carbon materials can play a unique role in the design of multifunctional materials for these systems.  The focus of this proposal is to combine the multiple functions for which carbons have been used over the last several decades into a structural carbon component.  Recent research has demonstrated the viability of an innovative new process for producing net-shaped carbon reinforced composites which avoids the use of costly fibers and complex forming procedures.  This is accomplished by the thermal decomposition of wood under controlled conditions to produce a porous carbon monolith which can be shaped by conventional low cost machining.  The shaped carbon serves as a scaffold for forming a composite via infiltration with a second phase without change in dimensions.  These carbons have been demonstrated to have compressive mechanical strengths that are superior to the precursor woods from which they are derived.  In addition, it has been shown that it is possible to activate these materials to yield surface areas similar to those produced by other charcoal activation processes.",

Assessment of these impacts requires knowledge of the acoustic source mechanisms, propagation effects, and requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act. In Phase I we will draw heavily on the rocket engine acoustic source investigative testing that we recently completed as well as expand our recent literature search on rocket engine acoustic sources. Our far field acoustic propagation techniques, developed from explosive charge detonation and large calibre gun firing tests, will be combined with our knowledge of rocket (engine noise and vehicle bow shock) sources to form a preliminary far field noise footprint prediction method. It is anticipated the results would be shown grahically using Air Force developed software, NMPLOT. Also, we intend to add IBON to our current noise ciriteria data base. In Phase II the nosie footprint software will be formalized, tested with field measurements and a graphical user interface will be added to complete the nosie assessment tool.",

This high-efficiency, low-power, two-phase pumped loop will use a unique two-phase working fluid pair that offers the capability of higher efficiency and lower pumping power becuase of its heat of solution characteristic. This heat of solution characteristic, combined with the latent heat of vaporazation, significantly increases the cooling capacity of the working fluid, resulting in significantly lower flow rates required for a given cooling load, decreasing the pumping power required. The Phase I effort will analyze varous working fluid pairs, select the optimum fluid pair, design and fabricate a two-phase pumped loop test stand, and compare the performance of the two-phase pumped loop operating with the working fluid pair to the performance of the same loop operating with two-phase single-component fluid alone.",

The composite will have a relatively high thermal conductivity coupled with a very high effective heat capacity. This technology will allow for the design of small, high-performance heat exchange devices that are insensitive to variations in heat load: are inexpensive to manufacture, and: are more universally applicable than conventional heat exchangers because the composite can readily be made to conform to complex shapes. Furthermore, since liquids or gases are not involved, the thermal performance of this material will be insensitive to g-loading or ambient pressure level.  Because of the high thermal performance that can be achieved, exchange devices or structures can be designed for applications where: spatial or temporal temperature uniformity is required (such as with phased array radar antennas), or high localized cooling is required (spot cooling of power electronics)",

Physics Innovations Inc. has developed an imaging sensor technique using a novel array of polarizers, which may be suitable for integration with an imaging sensor which can be compact and consumes low power. Such a system could be integrated on a single substrate to form an intelligent imaging polarimeter on a chip. In the Phase I project, we will explore concepts and technologies for the design of an intelligent optical imaging polarimeter on a chip.

Report the identity of components along the shotline, the incident angles at each intersection of the shotline with a surface, and the distance traveled, 3. Be easily integrated into vulnerability codes such as MUVES, 4. Interrogate Pro-E files to report the material properties of intersected components. This tool will eliminate the difficult translation of target geometry between commercial CAD systems and BRLCAD. This translation is presently required because the current MUVES ray-tracer functions only with BRLCAD geometry. The proposed standalone program will be capable of ray-tracing surface and solid geometry from a variety of commercial CAD systems. ThermoAnalytics will optimize it for ray-tracing files produced by Pro-E. The program will run on multiple platforms (UNIX and Windows systems).

As electric vehicles become more popular, this problem is becoming increasingly expensive and complex. Creare proposes to develop a standardized charger with the flexibility to rapidly recharge any battery size or chemistry for electric and hybrid vehicles. It is based on a flexible hardware architecture that can automatically be reconfigured for each battery. Very flexible, software based charger configurations are used to connect power electronic building blocks in whatever manner necessary to achieve the voltage, current, and monitoring functions required. Using this method, the same charger can recharge a 24 volt, 200 ampere battery as well as a 600 volt, 20 ampere battery. In Phase I, we will determine Air Force charging requirements, evaluate various power electronic converter topologies, and develop laboratory prototype software and hardware to flexibly recharge batteries of different types. We will evaluate reliability, cost-effectiveness, maintenance, and operating issues in this phase. In Phase II, we will implement the Phase I research by producing field quality chargers to handle the full range of Air Force charging requirements.",

This collection approach addresses situations where either fluid evaporation or freezing temperatures are a concern and where the biosensors require a liquid sample.  (2) MicroRAC: Air-to-water sampler whose biological aerosol samples could be collected directly into water.  The product will be a micromachined aerosol sampling system that interfaces with either of these devices, simultaneously collecting, concentrating, and delivering the sample to the appropriate location within the integrated pathogen detection system. The aerosol sampler will be based on the proprietary micromachined aerosol collector technology, currently under development for CBDCOM. The micromachined aerosol collector will identify airborne pathogenic materials for a wide variety of applications including UAV, for individuals, and other civilian uses. We will challenge the collectors with bacterial spores such as Bacillus globigi and a bacteriophage such as MS-2 (virus).

ASAP has been demonstrated to be an ideal technology for implementing complex multiply-accumulate algorithms, such as a correlator. In Phase I, it is shown that ASAP is fully capable of performing Fourier transforms and correlation at speeds which are at least 8\u00bf to 16\u00bf faster than currently available from existing DSP processors with the same silicon investment. The Phase I study will begin the FCAT implementation process, and will result in the design definition and integration of the core element of the FCAT technology. An optional Phase I study will position FCAT for implementation as a COTS CBIC in Phase II.",

The MINO will oscillate at a frequency in the range of 1-10 GH (nominally 6Ghz).  The MINO is specifically designed to drive high performance analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) in advanced digital receivers.  These 16-bit ADCs are characterized by 100mhz bandwidth, 100dB SNR, and 100dB SFDR.  To support these ADCs, the MINO must strive to attain 1fs jitter, which exceed the best jitter performance reported to date (1.1fs)!  That jitter was reported on a one-of-a-kind, rack mounted laboratory source.  Achieving whale-size performance in a minnow-size package is a daunting challenge.  Q-DOT has 21 years experience in the design and development of high speed, high precision data acquisition equipment (e.g. digitizers, ADCs, etc.).  Q-DOT staff guided by Dr. William F. Egan, a world renowned author and frequency source designer will explore multiple approaches to attaining the MINO goals.  To the extent possible, MINO will utilize IBM's advanced SiGe BiCMoS processes, including those currently in development.  The core SiGe BiCMOS chip will be complemented with discrete components (e.g. low noise transistors) to improve performance.  MINO will be packaged in an MCM or hybrid.",

MMCs are a class of materials that have superior physical, mechanical, and thermal properties; including specific strength and modulus, high temperature stability, thermal conductivity, and controlled coefficient of thermal expansion.  Because of inherent differences to traditional materials, MMCs provide the properties necessary for many advanced structural, aerospace, electronic, thermal management, and wear applications.  Extending microstructural refinement of MMCs down to the range of nanostructures should result in significant property improvements.  A novel aspect of this work is the in-situ production of nonoxide composite powders through Gas-Phase Combustion Synthesis.  The powders are coated in a fully removable encapsulation material to ensure they retain their purity until consolidation.  We will also employ a novel encapsulation method that removes the encapsulation material just prior to consolidation so that powders are never directly exposed to oxygen. The proposed synthesis and consolidation technologies address the critical issues facing the successful implementation and commercialization of nanostructured MMCs. They represent the first scalable means of producing high purity, unagglomerated powder in a way that the as-produced powder can be processed using cost effective, commercially-viable handling procedures.  For this program we will produce and mechanically test aluminum-aluminum nitride MMCs",

In several recent development efforts, it has been demonstrated that manmade objects have a significantly stronger polarization signal than natural backgrounds resulting in good contrast that complements the conventionally imaged infrared signature. Other recent research has suggested that polarization sensing may increase detection range through optically dense media such as fog or aerosol laden atmosphere. However, these experimental systems frequently require long data acquisition times, which results in artifacts in the polarization imagery due to platform or target motion. Additionally, calibration and investigation of systematic errors in these systems is difficult and robust calibration procedures have not been fully demonstrated. SY Technology, Inc proposes an aggressive instrument develop program beginning with modeling and prototype design efforts in this Phase I task. Infrared polarization signatures for typical scenarios will be modeled followed by analysis of various polarimetric detection schemes meeting the 30 Hz frame rate requirement. Once the optimal detection scheme is chosen, the prototype instrument will be designed complete with component specifications, schematics, data reduction, and calibration algorithms.

        "abstract": "Not Available  Multispectral imaging offers significant advantages over conventional imaging by providing diversity data to detect camouflaged or low-contrast targets, reduce complex scene clutter and identify materials.  Passive multispectral imaging is susceptible to undesirable and often uncontrollable effects such as changes in illumination angle and intensity, diurnal cycles, and varying material emissivities.  Active sensors overcome these limitations and also provide discriminates not readily available in passive sensors, such as degree of polarization and range information.  In Phase I, CTI will develop an optical scattermodel that combines physics-based scattering phenomena (diffuse and glint reflections, depolarization, etc.) with empirical data (bidirectional reflectance) to determine an optimal feature vector for materials classification.  The model will be incorporated into CTI's existing comprehensive coherent and direct detection laser radar performance modeling suit to determine the optimal multispectral sensor design for enhanced contrast target detection.  In Phase II, an active imaging sensor based upon the optimal architecture chosen in Phase I will be designed and fabricated for initial laboratory and field tests.  The proposed work leverages CTI's expertise in developing frequency agile lasers, flight-worthy transceivers and signal processors.",

Aptima proposes a steamlined approach to identify critical team competencies, knowledge, and skills. This approach combines information about the nature of the tasks being performed with team theory and information about the structure and functions of the team to identify critical measurement points for more in-depth development of competency requirements and measures. Scenario events are then created to provide critical points for performance assessment. Because critical measurement points are scenario-bases, both automated and real-time observational measures are driven by scenario timing. This allows more efficienct measurement during the scenario and more rapid feedback to the team. At the end of Phase I, we will demonstrate an implementation of the measurement approach that uses a handheld data-input device synched to a simulation scenario to show how the data entry and feedback process can be streamlined. The proposed Aptima team has outstanding qualifications in developing, implementing, and assessing performance measures for distributed teams, supported by partnership with the University of Dayton Research Institute (UDRI), with extensive experience in developing measures of performance and measures of effectiveness (MOPs/MOEs) for Air Force mission tasks.",

Spacecraft structural elements incorporated specifically to protect the payload from launch and separation loads represent parasitic mass after orbit insertion. Consumption of this structural mass to generate useful propulsive thrust will reduce the onboard propellant mass necessary for orbit maintenance and end-of-life operations, increase revenue-producing payload mass, and/or increase the orbital lifetime of telecommunications and other satellites. Traditional materials such as aluminum or graphite composites do not qualify as dual-function structural-propellant materials. We propose novel structural thermoplastic composites as promising candidates. Available commercially at low cost, these low density materials have good structural properties similar to those of aluminum. They also have desirable physicochemical characteristics as a monopropellant or bipropellant constituent. We will 1) analyze structural and chemical performance of the materials, 2) design a composite propulsive structural component for strength/stiffness, efficient volumetric heat addition, and routing of reaction products, and (iii) fabricate and test the component. At the conclusion of Phase I, we will deliver a small scale demonstration propulsive component to the Air Force.",

This SNMP interface will provide an open pathway to mission-specific network management functions which can not only monitor the current configuration of all CORBA objects, but also dynamically control and alter the distribution of those objects on specific network resources. A proof-of-concept prototype will be developed to demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing an SNMP interface for our CMSS security broker without compromising underlying CMSS security mechanisms.

An incoming signal is directed onto a delay line, with a small fraction of the signal directed to the discriminator crowbars the delay line, thus protecting the receiver. For a DEW to be effective against this line of defense, all of the discriminators must be destroyed, leaving the receiver vulnerable to the excessive amount of RF energy. Conventional DEW require excessive amount of energy and volume. These systems also require complex power supply, vacuum systems, and are driven by short-lived cathodes. This proposal details a PROPRIETARY alternative to the conventional HPM methods in the form of a Marx generator-based phased array. The proposed system is capable of delivering terawatts of peak power or RF bursts of gigawatts. The volume usage of the proposed system is a fraction of existing systems and relies on tradition power supply technologies at substantially lower voltage levels",

Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a dynamic digital holographic vibrometer (DDHV) for non-intrusive vibration measurement of the whole blade of a turbine engine for on-line analysis. The high resolution DDHV instrument is based on a single snap-shot approach, and is unaffected by environmental conditions such as rotation, vibration, heat, and window contamination. The proposed device offers a unique integration of: high resolution holographic interferometry; whole-area, short-pulse recording; digital phase detection; electronic signal synchronization; high speed image capture and storage; and on-line image processing. In Phase I, POC will procure or develop the essential hardware and software, and integrate them as a preproduction prototype in Phase II. Phase I will also address issues related to compatibility and compactness of the proposed DDHV device, which are critical to meeting Air Force requirements.",

Earlier designs could not be employed in many practical applications due to their restrictive specifications (high cost and low accuracy). Since 1995, the technical staff of VeNIS Technologies has been actively developing a design methodology for producing just such an accurate and inexpensive INS, based on distributed accelerometers in combination with small-size and low-cost gyros. Based on this methodology, several prototypes of inexpensive integrated gyros (i- gyros) and i-gyro-based INS have been designed and tested. Tests of those prototypes have confirmed the validity of the proposed design methodology. The work already completed on this INS will lead to the development of a DISTANT (distributed inertial sensor tactical navigation tool). Phase I of this SBIR will concentrate on the development of virtual gyroscopes of the first and second type, on the combination of virtual gyros with small-size, low-cost gyroscopes and on the design of the resulting INS. Computer modeling of the proposed methods, as well as construction of prototypes and subsequent hardware testing are also among the proposed goals of Phase I.",

The machine vision system will provide highly reliable indication of launchbar seating during day and night operations, in all weather conditions. The proposed system will require no alteration to the aircraft, and requires no attachment of any components to moving parts of the catapult. The machine vision system will not protrude above deck, will provide its own source of collimated red light for illumination of the target, and will compensate for variations in shuttle position after tensioning.

The structure of this device will be a dual-junction monolithic tandem cell. Working with Sarnoff Corporation, SMI has recently demonstrated a high-efficiency InGaAsSb TPV cell with a cut-off wavelength of 2.3 microns. This cell represents the state-of-the-art with internal quantum efficiencies over 90% at a peak wavelength of 2.0 microns. To significantly improve upon this device, a next generation of dual junction tandem TPV cells with conversion efficiencies in the range of 30 to 40% need to be developed. The innovation of the proposed program will be development of the first tandem cells for TPV applications that provide greater than 30% energy conversion efficiency. In the Phase I program, we will determine the most promising structure for a high-efficiency tandem TPV cell, building upon our existing InGaAsSb device for the bottom cell. Experimental work will utilize our existing epitaxial growth and processing technologies for fabricating these devices. When fully developed, this technology will result in a significantly higher performance, lower weight, cost-effective improvement for low temperature TPV generating systems.",

The CRT half-life is normally less than 1000 hours because they generally operate at relatively high brightness levels. Flight Visions proposes to do a feasibility study of three different technologies: AMLCD Light Valve, MEMS, and Laser. One technology will be selected for a further conceptual study and preliminary designs for implementation will be accomplished. Ultimately, a demonstration unit would evolve during Phase II. The selected technology must have proven reliability and provide: adequate luminance for operation in an open cockpit in bright sunlight, good contrast ratio, adequate resolution, good repeatability, and accuracy. Typically, the brightness requires 1600 ft-Lamberts minimum reflected light off of the HUD combiners into the pilot's eyes. Assuming a reflection coefficient of 30% for frequency selective combiners, the incident light intensity from the HUD lens system must be approximately 5000 ft-Lamberts. Accounting for efficiencies, transmissivity of the lens, and engineering margins; the technology must have luminance capability of at least 10,000 ft-Lamberts.

NZ Applied Technologies has recently developed novel nearly lattice matched (or strained) and chemically compatible semiconductor heterostructure systems comprising complex ternary and quaternary nitrides and SiC. These heterostructures should have virtually dislocation free interfaces, and could add to SiC homostructure electron devices all the advantages of heterostucture technology. Negligible hole injection from the SiC base to the WBG emitter is ensured by larger then 1eV band offsets, providing greater gain and wider bandwidth. One unique property of these novel WBG lattice matched semiconductor emitters, is high electron conductance, even at band gaps above 4.2 eV. Electron conductivity can be  controllably varyed by controlling parameters during epitaxial growth. The proposed novel HBT device offers superior performance compared to the power devices based on (Al)GaN/SiC heterojunction and SiC homojuctions. The goal of this Phase I effort is, therefore, to demonstrate an HBT, based on the proposed novel heterostructures",

        "abstract": "Not Available  Capacitors are formed by depositing a dielectric between two conductive plates.  While fabrication techniques achieve outstanding levels of repeatabillity and consistency, many applications are difficult to fullfill with current manufacturing methods.  A solid state resistor film may be  trimmed  to a certain value after deposition by the selective ablation of the resisting medium by a laser beam.  A capacitor, however, is formed by the entrapment of a dielectric material between the metal conductors.  We propose the development of a capacitor using a dielectric material that has a dielectric constant which may be altered by exposure to ultraviolet radiation after deposition to provide a basis for trimmable or tunable capacitive devices.  This will involve the use of organosilicon materials plasma polymerized at room temperature and a photo oxidative polymer which when exposed to UV and oxygen will pattern and is alterable with UV dosage.  As the literature shows no indication of work in this area discussions with users are needed to develop and identify specific areas of application.",

Through a collaborative process, the Universal Trail Assessment Process (UTAP) was developed to provide access information to trail users. Trail managers use the process to determine compliance with accessibility design guidelines. UTAP trainings are limited, particularly in rural areas, by the small number of UTAP Trainers. This research project will develop a training program to create a large, geographically diverse pool of UTAP Trainers. An increase in UTAP Trainers will ensure that more land management agencies, like the USDA Forest Service, will have the opportunity to use the UTAP. Phase I began the process of developing training materials through the establishment of a Project Advisory Board, drafting materials for Train-the-Trainer workshops, identifying training candidates, and developing a preliminary national implementation strategy. Phase II will refine the training materials and evaluate their effectiveness, and finalize the national implementation plan. Widespread availability of the UTAP will enhance access for all Americans, including people with disabilities, parents with young children, older adults, and inexperienced hikers, by enabling individuals to make informed decisions about trails appropriate for their interests and abilities.",

We will use at-sea data, boundary element scattering models, existing echo detectors, advanced resonance extraction technologies and noise reduction techniques to conduct our research.  The combination of these tools will demonstrate improvement in discriminating submarine echoes from other detections. In prior research, we have proven that our extraction technology can detect useful resonance phenomena in full-scale targets in mono-static geometries, but the reliable target to sensor ranges need to be increased. And, based on our work with acoustic scattering models, we believe that multi-static geometries will have stronger resonance amplitudes - thus motivating our proposed research.  SSC also will pursue both coherent and incoherent sonar concepts, relying on noise and reverberation reduction techniques applicable to both types of sonars.  In Phase I, we will process sonar echoes, comparing the resonance based classifier to existing data screening methods, as well as identify operational concepts compatible with resonant scattering theory and resonance extraction technology.  These findings will be the foundation for a Phase II real time prototype system.",

Single crystal PZT materials provide at least 400 percent more strain than polycrystalline materials and make it possible to produce significantly smaller actuators while maintaining the same performance. Burleigh proposes to develop new design and assembly methods that that compensate for the higher strain and lower stiffness of single crystal PZT by using anisotropic composite material bonds, electrodes and interfaces. By using these anisotropic composite materials the internal stresses are minimized and the output efficiency maximized. At least these composite material concepts will be considered: (1) micro-machining (MEMS) thin arrays of support posts connected by flexible links, (2) mixing spherical particles with polymer adhesive prior to bonding, and (3) dicing thin disks from unidirectional composite rods. All these approaches have the same objective of maximizing the d33 stiffness and d31 yield strain. Practical manufacturing solutions will be investigated and identified. In the option phase, a single crystal PZT stack and flex- tensional amplifier will be designed and constructed, using the selected composite electrodes and bonds, and fully tested to characterize motion, creep, hysteresis, non-linearity, force, stiffness and resonant frequency.",

Busek proposes to develop a micro sized plasma torch system to facilitate the direct writing/sintering of refractory components. The potential advantages of this technique are clear; the part is ready for use upon release from the build, there is no post-processing step, where a part may shrink or distort. For this and other reasons, a micro-plasma torch prototyping technique can show distinct advantages over laser sintering and other competing three-dimensional printing processes. The goal of the proposed program is to develop a miniaturized, high power density plasma micro-torch system for application to direct writing of high melting point (>2000 degrees Celsius) components. The micro torch will be demonstrated using silicon and hafnium carbide powders. In Phase I, Busek will produce a micro scale plasma torch and test its ability to fabricate simple objects. In continued work, the torch will be incorporated into a low cost system using commercially available stages and drivers.  BENEFITS:  Busek's plasma torch direct writing sintering technology has the potential to form dense parts and functionally gradient components directly from powders. This process is ideal for prototyping of high temperature ceramic and refractory metal parts. A system based on this micro-torch will be immediately useful to ceramic manufacturers.",

The use of non-glass substrates poses several challenges, including the requirement of modified scribing techniques due to the thin opaque substrate, the inability to deposit cells in a superstrate configuration due to the opaque substrate, differing film growth due to lack of Na from the glass, and possible limits on the process temperature if polymer substrates are used.

However, greater power reduction can be achieved only if the problem is approached from a global perspective. This includes algorithmic, architectural and circuit levels. Further, significant power reduction has been observed when system-level improvements are applied. Primary among these is the software-level power efficiency. This involves performing a power spectrum analysis of the instruction set of the target processor, followed by an analysis of the assembly code for the target application. Power-hungry instructions are replaced with more efficient ones. At the architectural level, bus-encoding schemes can be applied to reduce the impact of switching at the large capacitances associated with the I/O pads. These methods include data- compression and coding schemes such as bus-invert coding. At the circuit-level, adaptive voltage scaling, in conjunction with self-timed approaches, offer great promise. Strong ARM processor has very good low-power characteristics that makes it an attractive target architecture. A synchronous ARM, integrated with a DSP core can offer high speed DSP solutions with significant power reduction. The techniques developed in Phase-I will be applied to an asynchronous ARM DSP s",

        "abstract": "Not Available  This proposal presents a unique technical opportunity for NAVSEA to build on an existing body of knowledge to create both metrics and the quantifying techniques used to assess model performance. DDI has pioneered the development of complex dynamic simulation models for the USN over the past eight years, many under the SBIR program. During this time, DDI has often provided V&V assurances to its software users as well as examined third-party software developed by others, including client-server applications. DDI's strength, however, lies in its extensive experience in judging the validity of complex models and modeling systems and in its experience in the development of metrics for the most complex type of simulation models, those involving multiple, non-linear feedback relationships with multi-variable interdependencies. DDI intends to apply its expertise into the development of a method for determining and describing the degree to which intricate simulations emulate reality. DDI will categorize specific purposes for model use; identify critical aspects models must satisfy for validity; and, define metrics to measure model performance. In addition, DDI will identify potential approaches for quantifying model performance against such metrics and demonstrate how at least one of the approaches might be applied in practice.",

Additionally. we intend to demonstrate the feasibility of gating and modulating the back surface of the CCD at MHZ rates - eliminating the need to modulate the EBCCD photocathode. Current accumulation techniques used to accumulate the back surface of thinned CCDS are inadequate for optimized EBCCD performance because standard processes leave a depletion region at the back surface that cause some electron holes pairs to recombine and not be detected. We will use MBE 'delta doping  and a  biased flash gate  back surface preparation of ten high speed, back-illuminated CCDs provided to the program on a cost sharing basis. The surface techniques have been demonstrated to have characteristics that make them better suited to EBCCD operation. Moreover, biased flash gates will permit modulation of the EBCCD gain. Optimization of the CCD back-surface is important for the following reasons: 1) non-electrically-pinned CCD back-surfaces exhibit hysterisis and instabilities, 2) improperly passivated CCD back surfaces result in  dead layers  that have poor gain versus voltage performance (this is important because voltages above 1.8 keV cause resulting k-alpha x-rays to damage the CCD) - higher gain at the requisite low voltages permits better signal-to-noise, 3) for reliable manufacturing. control is needed over the back-surface characteristics, and 4) gain and modulation control - independent of photocathode greatly reduces high voltage power supply complexity and is ideal for LADAR applications.",

Amercom/Synterials has recently been working on a unique approach to a low cost SiC/CMC material by attacking the problem on the matrix materials, preforming and matrix processing fronts. The new Arnercom/Synterials approach utilizes a fugitive material as a transfer agent to carry one of the matrix constituent elements to the other where it will react and form SiC, the desired matrix. Moderate temperature, ambient pressure and controlled atmosphere are all that is required to process the matrix material. Standard PMC lay up or filament winding processes can be used to produce the net shape reinforcement preform. This process uses low cost commercial materials and does not require expensive precursor chemicals, sophisticated low pressure processing apparatus or handling of corrosive and hazardous gases. The SynSiC matrix placement process and its raw materials offer potentially a very low cost path to a SiC matrix for CMC materials.

These simulators need computer-controlled urban-oriented entities to interact with trainees realistically, taking into account: physical models of human movement and performance degradation; reactive behaviors for selecting immediate actions; and reasoning for providing situation assessment and planning. To foster re-use of these entities, their software models must be stored in a repository. Traditional CGFs' modeling approaches, oriented towards representing platforms, not people, are inappropriate to meet these challenges. We propose a divide-and-conquer approach. We separate the repository and the UHE simulation from the training simulator to foster re-use. We further divide the UHE representations into  behaviors  and  bodies,  each of which is stored in the repository. We use existing COTS products to implement the  body,  and use the ONR-funded  Subsumption Architecture  developed at MIT's AI Lab to implement the behaviors. The resulting repository will contain UHE behaviors that are more realistic, more efficient, more numerous, and easier for subject matter experts to audit, than competing approaches. Reliance on COTS software lowers cost, time, and risk. We propose to obtain sample individual and group UHE behaviors from the sponsor. We will classify these sample behaviors according to Subsumption Architecture levels and test them in its Behavior Language environment. We will define sensor and actuator APIs so that other CGFs can re-use the behaviors written to that API. At the customer's option, we will retarget the back end of the BL compiler to be compatible with C/C++ code. Finally, we will document our findings in a Final Report.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  HYPRES proposes to develop a novel passive, millimeter-wave imager (PMWI) of much lower cost than competing types. The PN1WI will employ a staring array of micromachined detectors, each coupled to its own thin-film antenna and feedhorn. Until the present, the sensitivity of such a scheme has not beau adequate for passive imaging. Recent advances in micromachined arrays for the infrared, however, can also be adapted to millimeter-wave imaging, raising the sensitivity to the necessary levels. The resulting P5IWI system will feature complete integration on a single chip of detectors, antennas, feedhorns and CMOS readout circuitry. The advantages of this approach include high reliability, low fabrication COST, small system size, and the elimination of scanning by the use of a full two-dimensional staring geometry. In Phase I HYPRES will design and fabricate a full two-dimensional array with off-chip read-out of a single line of detectors. In Phase 0, an integrated on-chip CMOS read-out of the entire array will be developed.  BENEFITS:  The passive millimeter-wave imager will find application in airport security systems, imagers for locating forest fires through dense smoke, and navigation aids for planes and boats in foggy environments. The low cost and small size of the imager will make it attractive for a wide range of military and commercial customers.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  The ability to form images through densely scattering media has been highly desirable in medical diagnostics. The  gating  approach utilizes the principle that scattered light will travel farther than unscattered, ballistic light. A laser, with a very short pulse width or coherence length, can make a holographic recording of the light traversing the volume, and only the ballistic light will interfere with the reference beam, creating an image without scatter. Applied to propulsion diagnostics, this technology will yield images from dense flows which are surrounded by a scattering medium through which images cannot be obtained by conventional means. The recent development of photorefractive multiple quantum well (MQW) crystals has provided a breakthrough in recording materials for image gating. These crystals have an extremely high dynamic range, allowing a hologram to be recorded despite noise many orders of magnitude greater than the signal. They are also capable of continuous image capture at kHz repetition rates, making them ideal for flow analysis. North Dancer Labs, Inc. (NDL) will, in Phase I, design and build a test bed for Gated Holographic Imaging (GHI) to demonstrate the proof-of-principle for a high-speed, MQW-based recorder. A copper vapor laser with a dye cell will provide sufficient power and short coherence (spatial and temporal) at kHz recording rates. Beyond simple visualization, NDL will also investigate the ability to provide quantitative data by applying shearing interferometry, Schlieren photography, particle imaging velocimetry, or resonant holography to prove diagnostic capabilities of the GHI system.",

Semiconductor micro-fabrication techniques combined with chemical vapor deposited (CVD) silicon carbide process technology is being explored for producing MEMS-type turbine rotors. The fabrication of relatively thick (100-500 micron) devices is currently limited by the strength, residual stresses, and inadequate conformal coverage that is attributable to the columnar grain growth of thick vapor-deposited SiC.

The reduced grain size is critical as feature dimensions in potential high temperature MEMS decrease in scale. Nanolayering of CVD structures has also been demonstrated to improve surface replication as compared to the conventional, monolithic CVD material due to the elimination of columnar grain growth.

Since these application domains require the same process information, its collection for one application should easily support other purposes. Yet, sharing and reuse of process-related information across applications remains an unrealized vision. The need for standards to capture, represent, share, and display process-related information is particularly important in training applications. Process-centered training provides students with the most reliable approach for understanding, internalizing, and applying new concepts. The objective of this project is two-fold: (1) Define an XML/IDEF3 standard, providing a neutral format for capturing, organizing, and sharing process-related data based on the XML Internal formatting standard, and (2) Develop an advanced authorizing toolkit for situation-based, process-centric computer-based training using XML/IDEF3 data. The proposed developments will provide an unprecedented ability to share and manipulate process information across web-based training applications, as will be demonstrated through this and subsequent phases of this SBIR.",

To this end, the primary ofjective of the proposed research program is to provide the engine designer with scramjet fuel injectors that achieve better penetration, lower performance losses, and higher mixing efficiencies than previously tested fuel injections. This will be accomplished through the use of narrow, flush-mounted, locally pressure-matched injectors that would produce little drafg, require no active colling,and produce only a small region of high heat flux on the combustor wall. The military and private-sector markets for a dramatically improved scarmjet injector are substantial, and the development of such an injector would greatly strenghten the position of the developing organization within the niche area of hypersonic propulsion.

The SWBF has a new optical architecture that is uniquely different from any other existing eye protection devices. Basically the SWBF consists of a liquid crystal spatial filter which is electrically addressed by a photo-sensor. The photo-sensor serves dual functions. It is used to detect the position and intensity of the dangerous light source. The sensed photo-voltage is used to directly control the opacity of the selected part of the pixels in the liquid crystal filter. The opacity of the specifically chosen pixels will reduce the intensity of the light originating from the corresponding dangerous source. The degree of reduction is adaptively proportional to the intensity of the light source. In the meantime, the filter will allow the surrounding objects of normal brightness be visible by the eye with little attenuation. The SWBF is self-reliant, adaptive, and smart. None of the existing eye protection devices has these unique characteristics and capabilities. Advantages of the device include wide field-of-view, broadband transmission, and large dynamic range.

        "abstract": "Not Available  The U.S. Navy has enjoyed a substantial submarine acoustic advantage for over four decades. However, improvements in the new classes of Russian submarines have significantly reduced generated noise levels, narrowing this advantage dramatically. The Navy is looking for highly innovative technologies to meet this challenge. This Phase I proposal brings highly innovative state-of-the-practice COTS technologies to the design of a Total Ship Monitoring System (TSM). This proposal will address the sensor telemetry and processing system for a TSM system and proposes a number of options for the sensor system. The proposed sensor telemetry system will be based on Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) COTS technology and the processing system will be based on the Advanced Processing Build (APB) processor model (i.e., Transportable Middleware and COTS Hardware and Software). The success of a TSM system rests with its ability to scale, evolve, and inter-operate with other ship systems. Use of proven COTS technologies and processes in this Phase I will provide the key building blocks for development of an architecture that will remain modern through evolutionary processor upgrades and increasingly capable software. These technologies also ensure an open system that will prove easily compatible with other ship's systems.",

Wilcoxon Research, Inc. believes, however, that one of the most promising and direct paths to commercialization is through the development of miniature, high sensitivity accelerometers. Moreover, miniature accelerometers will have overall physical dimensions in the mesoscale range, obviating the requirement of growing large diameter (> 1 cm) crystals. Wilcoxon Research, Inc. hereby proposes to demonstrate a miniature accelerometer design and prototype fabrication that makes use of piezoelectric single crystals with high electromechanical coupling. One of the major advantages of this new technology is the ability to significantly decrease the size of the sensor while maintaining the same performance when compared to conventional PZT based sensors. Due to the smaller size and unique packaging, the production cost for single crystal- based sensors has the potential of being much less than PZT sensors. Its use in embedded sensing applications, throughout the military and private sector, is expected to be widespread.",

Past results demonstrate that all the pieces are in place to build such a device.  The objective of this project is to determine the feasibiity of the following. (1) Incorporate a more reliable side-chain polymer into the core of the fiber preform. (2) Incorporate into a fiber preform electrodes whose melting temperature and/or plastic range better matches the glass transition temperature of the polymer. (3) Demonstrate that an electrooptic polymer fiber can be pulled from this fiber.  A successful demonstration of these three technical objectives would provide a robust electrooptic fiber that could be used as an inline component to make a family of devices such as molulators and multiplexers.  We have already demonstrated that electrodes can be incorporated around a light-guilding single-mode core and that the fiber can be poled with an electric field during the fiber drawing process.",

This proposal addresses a DoD and industry identified need for closed loop composition and thickness control for viable cost-effective production yield and reliability requirements. Foster-Miller will develop an in-situ real-time imaging flux monitor for MBE growth processes. The diagnostic sensor based on Doppler Resolved Laser Induced Fluorescence (DOPLIF) measurements extends the current art of in-situ monitoring by providing real-time position and velocity distribution of atomic species over the wafer growth substrate. Phase I will provide the proof-of-concept for the ability to obtain real-time deposition and composition information from 2-D fluorescence images.

Previously implemented systems (e.g.pager, radio based) are expensive to construct, and require the warfighter to carry bulky receiving equipment.  The web provides a cheap and lightweight infrastructure for access, but does not inherently support functions of aggregating and filtering data from heterogeneous sources.  This phase I effort proposed the Smart Data Channel approach to building a web-based information dissemination system using commercially available technologies.  In this approach, the information dissemination policy is specified as a collection of Smart Data Channels (SDC), objects that map information sets from heterogeneous information sources to the warfighter functions that need them.  Warfighters access this channelized information space by  logging in  (or tuning in) to a channel that they have authorization for.  They then receive a continuous, personalized data feed.  Phase I efforts will demonstrate the feasibility of an SDC-based dissemination system.  Phase II efforts will focus on a system that is scalable to large warfighter communities, and adapts to changing battlefield situations and mission goals.",

The transmitter developed will simultaneously generate a tunable millimeter wave subcarrier in the 10 to 100 GHz range and an optical carrier with power levels of 100mW or higher. The transmitter will have inherently low relative intensity and phase noise characteristics (RIN and phase noise). The novel approach followed in this proposal is significantly different from past practices in two aspects. First, the host material for the solid state laser is an electrooptic crystal, LiNbO3, which provides efficient interaction between the optical and electric fields. Secondly, we are fully integrating the laser with the microwave components to reduce parasitics and provide a compact, rugged and low cost package.  Phase I concerns the feasibility study and design of the proposed solid-state mode-locked microchip laser.  Of particular interest is the achievement of low phase noise (< -110 dBc/Hz @ 1 KHz offset) and millimeter wave frequency tunability.  In Phase II we will develop a prototype transmitter to demonstrate superior performance and address the manufacturing process to allow successful commercialization in Phase III for military and non-military applications.",

This effort will extend and further develop this capability both for detection of fatigue damage (including the formation of persistent slip bands prior to microcrack formation) and for specific fatigue monitoring applications on Air Force aircraft. The objectives of the Phase I effort are to: (1) establish the MWM-Array fatigue damage detection threshold for a selected alloy, (2) define requirements for a specific fatigue-critical area on a selected aircraft, (3) demonstrate the required fatigue detection feasibility for the selected application, and (4) determine the feasibility of implementing a portable system based on the MWM/Grid Methods for field/depot use, including both permanently mounted and wide-area imaging modes.

Intelligent sensors combine detection, processing, and control functions onto a single package to allow for autonomous detection and interpretation of optical signals. A specific case where an intelligent optical system is needed is in the detection, processing, and evaluation of infrared polarization imagery, which has shown potential for improved target discrimination over other infrared imaging techniques. To meet this need we propose to develop an intelligent, compact, imaging infrared polarimeter on a chip. The key innovation on which this polarimeter will be based is the recent development of efficient lithographic antennas at mid and far-infrared wavelengths. These antennas can be integrated monolithically with a detector on the same substrate, and since the shape of an antenna determines its response to incident ramification, an antenna and detector combination can be made polarization selective. By fabricating the proper set of antenna shapes with their attached detectors onto a single substrate, a  superpixel,  which is capable of measuring the full Stokes vector can be developed. Reductions in size, cost, complexity, and improvement in speed over current systems are possible with a solid state polarimeter.",

The refrigerator is intended for use with cryogenic sensors, and cold electronic devices, superconducting and semiconducting instruments, Josephson voltage standards and IR imaging cameras for both space-borne and terrestrial applications. The type of refrigerator proposed for development is an innovative novel variant of the two-stage pulse tube refrigerator with warm end expander.  The pressure wave generators used for both stages are hydraulically driven diaphragm compressors.  Diaphragm expanders are used for both warm end expanders.  The expanders operate synchronously with the compressors but lead in phase by approximately one-quarte cycle. The pulse tubes are coaxial with and are enclosed within the regenerator matrices.  The regenerator matrices comprise sintered metal powder elements of annular form.  Rare earth metal powders are used for the regenerator elements at the lowest temperatures int he second stage. The two stages of the pulse tube generate refrigeration at two temperature levels in the range of 5 - 20 K in one case and 50 - 90 K in the other.  The two stages may be deployed in an extended tandem geometry but the alternative folded parallel geometry is generally more convenient.",

The proposed concept builds on Athena's Fault Tolerant Control (FTC) technology, with proven demonstration in flight, real-time detection of single sensor and actuator failures. Athena's FTC achieves fault tolerance through analytic redundancy. The principles are based on deterministic non-linear control concepts and physical system dynamics, rather than genetic learning methods. The system model and failure detection filters are used to estimate the behavior of sensors and actuators, and compared to real measurements as the discriminating voting element. The proposed concept will resolve the ambiguity with multiple correlated hardware failures, while assuring stable and controllable authority throughout the flight envelope. Athena's elegant FTC implementation will enable an economical augmentation path onto current flight control systems. Subsonic air vehicles, whether strike system or commercial aircraft, are among the most vulnerable to man- portable air defense systems. The trend toward expensive survivability measures continues to strain diminishing defense budgets. Lower cost survivability options as those proposed here, are necessary to reverse this trend and assure maturation of an emerging generation of flight control systems.",

As part of a monolithic optoelectronic technology, the thyristor is implemented as a vertical cavity device and is compatible with complementary HFET digital and analog electronics, with a complementary bipolar analog/digital gate configuration, and with vertical cavity lasers. The thyristor is based upon strained quantum well GaAs epitaxial growth with a natural emission frequency of 1 um. It is designed as a resonant vertical cavity detector with a three quantum well active absorbing region of about 300A and with current blocking barriers on either side resulting in detection which is highly resistant to radiation. With the absence of natural oxides in this structure, the HFET electronics is also radiation tolerant and implements high performance complementary logic because the natural threshold (+0.3V) are positive providing ample noise margins. The thyristor is unique in that it performs digital/analog detection in the off state and produces laser emission in the on state. By integrating with CHFET logic, a smart pixel may be designed to perform the functions of an emitter, modulator or detector depending on the logic levels applied to the resonant cavity device.

FRS training operations are complicated by major factors such as different skill levels among individual trainees, the use of scarce equipment (simulators, operational aircraft), and the occurrence of variable training setbacks arising from bad weather, equipment failure, or diversion of squadron resources to support operational Fleet activities. Each FRS generates a Master Training Plan (MTP) as an idealized curriculum schedule to help measure class completion dates, individual student progress, and average time-to-train. Currently, the MTP is a relatively inflexible, paper-based tool that requires significant man-hours to create and maintain. This Phase I SBIR proposes to investigate the feasibility of creating a software tool that could create, update, and maintain the MTP of an FRS while providing more analytical power than current methods. Our effort will research data requirements and sources and the statistical and other analytical modeling requirements needed by such a tool. In addition, we will conduct a Software Requirements Analysis to define the functional needs of the MTP generator and to plan Phase II software development, as well as implementation at a Navy FRS.

These algorithms will exploit nonlinear dynamics to cancel clutter and leave desired target echoes largely undisturbed, significantly increasing the probability of detection and reducing the probability of false alarms. Recent research has shown that modeling radar clutter as the output of a nonlinear system allows the receiver to successfully distinguish between clutter and target echo. Such nonlinear  clutter cancelers  have been implemented as hidden Markov models, nonlinear Kalman filters and neural networks. All methods take advantage of the fact that-in contrast to completely random noise-clutter is a low-order chaotic signal that can be predicted, if for only for a short time horizon. One experiment using this approach to extract acoustic signals from chaotic clutter reported a 27dB increase in signal-to-clutter ratio. Investigation by AETC Inc. has shown that active sonar reverberation and clutter also display these low-order nonlinear dynamics which are amenable to modeling and cancellation. AETC Inc. proposes to adapt these breakthroughs in radar processing to develop nonlinear clutter canceling algorithms for active sonobuoy use and demonstrate their effectiveness using recorded sea test data.",

Our approach can be viewed as a Psychoacoustic Noise Suppression (PSN) algorithm that enhances the speech signal to enable accurate speech recognition in noisy environments. The PSN algorithm has two key features that differentiate it from other speech enhancement systems: (1) a psychoacoustic model called IWAIF that preserves the features of the speech signal crucial to successful recognition (Krishnamurthy and Feth, Ohio State University). (2) an vector search algorithmic breakthrough, the TNE, discovered by FTI in 1994. This very low complexity algorithm can be used to search the database using partially corrupted or masked vectors, which is key to recovering the noise-suppressed speech signal.

        "abstract": "Not Available  The goal of the Phase I program is to demonstrate the technical feasibility of developing a scalable lossless optical splitter in a new gain medium.  Resultant devices should operate entirely in the optical domain, be polarization independent and be readily scaled to large numbers of output channels.  Importantly for Phase III commmercialization activities, the proposed splitters will be manufactured during planar processing techniques and, in quantity, should be significantly more affordable than conventional approaches.  The key enabling innovation underlying the approach is a new, versatile, low-cost amplifier.  Phase I will evaluate technical feasibility by determining the gain requirements for the candidate device designs, determine the losses associated with the proposed amplification scheme, and calculate from key measurements the expected gain associated with a splitter architecture.  Phase I will conclude with a down selection of a device configuration and detailed performance projections for a Phase II prototype based on the proposed amplifier scheme.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  NuTech Engineering is proposing to apply the new concept of  Design by Contract  to help in the system test and integration problems.   Design by Contract  allows test engineers to specify system requirements in the form of software which is downloaded to a special test monitor. This test monitor resides on the system processor chip but runs  separately  from the system processor.  The test module runs in a non-interference mode that allows the system processor to run at full speed. System contacts are extremely versatile and can be used to effectively support many different types of requirements.  For example,  Design by Contract  provides a powerful interface that allows the engineer to control and test the system.  Since the  Design by Contract  contracts are requirements, they are less subject to design and implementation errors.  These contracts are enforced by the on-board test module.  When a contract is violated, the test module takes appropriate action.  During test, this action may consist of outputting trace or other information to the test operation.  During flight operations, the results of a failure could be remedial actions providing a well defined approach to obtaining fault-tolerance",

Powdermet will utilize an innovative combination of microencapsulation, powder metallurgy, and reaction bonding in addition to the use of carbon and silica microballoons, to produce extremely lightweight, low CTE, thermally stable mirror structures.  The resultant structures will consist of a reaction bonded Gr/SiC mirror surface graded into a syntactic, Gr-reinforced syntactic SiC foam made net-shape using a slip-cast and sinter consolidation technique.  The mirror structure will be built up onto plaster molds and sintered, eliminating all but the final stages of polishing.  The ability to eliminate all but the final stages of polishing will allow for the fabrication of high optical quality structures having significantly lower areal density, at lower processing costs.  Thermal distortion and density will be minimized through the use of Gr-reinforced SiC syntactic foam, which has an approximate density and thermal expansion coefficient (CTE) of 600Kg/m3 and 1.3 ppm/K respectively with a modulus of over 60 Gpa.  By producing syntactic foam honeycomb supports, the density will be further reduced to less than 250 Kg/M3 while sacrificing less than 35% of the structural stiffness.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is a rapidly emerging commercial technology. This technology can be adapted to providing secure, digital compressed voice in unicast and multicast modes. The proposed SBIR research activity will lead to the development of a Networked Multipoint Secure Voice application that can be transparently overlaid on existing Navy ADNS networks to satisfy voice over wide area network requirements. Various voice compression algorithms will be explored for the best combination of voice quality and bandwidth utilization in the Navy's wireless environment. Requirements for a PC-based application will be defined to provide secure, multicast voice communications in a bandwidth efficient generic IP format. For the extreme narrowband circuit case (e.g. 2400 bps), methods will be explored to  spoof  the IP packet structure during call setup. Subsequent voice bits will then be streamed across the channel. The design will allow system interfacing to commercial routers, low-rate RF modems and multiplexers while still allowing the IP structure, as the LAN/WAN views it, to remain in standard format. Standard ATM switches with ethernet interfaces suffice for IP over AAL5 integration into the high speed ATM networks employed by the military. Security approaches for providing secure coding and secure call management will be identified. Encryption technologies to be considered include Fortezza variants, commercial encryption technologies, and legacy Navy encryption devices.",

Traditionally these windows have been spherical concentric shell elements to minimize optical aberrations over gimbal angle. These shapes are not aerodynamically efficient, resulting in high drag and large thermal transfer between the flowfield and the dome. Previous programs have utilized covers, deployable sensors, or active cooling to minimize thermal transfer. This program proposes to examine the benefits of combining aerodynamic dome shapes and minimization of thermal transfer via covers or active cooling. The collective expertise of OPTICS 1 and SAIC in the areas of optical design and analysis and aero-thermal modeling and analysis for aerodynamic shapes and will be focused in this effort. Relative benefits of previously tried and new methods will be investigated to enhance the achievable resolution and sensitivity required for the long stand-off range requirements of tomorrow's missiles.",

As a result of this demand, technologies such as microfabrication technology, which originally emerged as the electronics industry demanded smaller features in integrated circuits, are finding new applications including in space systems. Current microfabrication technologies, however, are limited to use with silicon. This poses problems when considering high temperature applications such as rocket components, as silicon melts at only ~1410 degrees C. TPL Incorporated (TPL) proposes to develop a novel means of fabricating miniaturized digital propulsion components from refractory ceramics such as silicon carbide. The proposed innovation will employ a novel, low-cost process known as  Channel Stamping,  using preceramic polymers to form the complex shapes. Successful completion of the Phase I effort will demonstrate, for the first time, the ability to fabricate micromachined MEMS devices from refractory, non-oxide ceramics, and will thereby allow micropropulsion components to be operated at higher temperatures, and enable more efficient operation. The proposed effort will exploit TPL's extensive experience in both high temperature materials and ceramic processing using preceramic polymer routes.",

Moreover, the networking challenges of the Web era demand a new generation of management systems featuring tighter linkage among user-, network- and application-level management information. It is plain that effective allocation of network resources cannot be devised unless the network elements fully understand the required performance and mission criticality of the various applications and of users roaming the network. To address these concerns, we propose a framework for developing a Policy Manager (PM) that consistently and coherently implements the Network Policy (NP) of an organization in a multi-vendor network infrastructure. The NP organizes the QoS levels of potential connections (and relevant attributes) into a Policy Directory from which an Absolute Ranking is generated. Used in conjunction with a set of Implementation Script Generators, this approach leads to a streamlined prioritization of network resources, transparently and coherently across multiple vendor implementations, in support of organizationally driven QoS provisioning as is imperative in Navy shipboard and shore-side networks. The PM will be compliant with existing and emerging protocol suites, including ATM and IETF standards (e.g., Intserv, Diffserv and LDAP); its modular structure allows easy upgrades in response to technological changes.",

While this was sufficient for stand-alone systems, it is not sufficient to support today's distributed simulation environments. Systems, once used for individual training, are being reused in distributed exercises to support collective training, mission planning, and mission rehearsal. These systems, of varying fidelity and data requirements, need to interact together in a shared synthetic environment. To support these systems, an open, flexible, distributed processing environment is needed. The system must provide a consistent representation of the SNE while supporting a wide array of source data and simulation systems. M\u00bfK Technologies will establish a robust SNE architecture that supports both embedded and distributed SNE calculations. The architecture is based on two primary components; the SNE Application Programmers Interface (API) and the Smart Server. The SNE API supports the incorporation of many different authoritative data sources, while insulating the simulation from changes in the underlying data formats and data distribution mechanisms. The SNE Smart Server will be capable of providing SNE calculations for end systems with different modeling requirements, and performing load balancing by distributing the SNE related processing across other network resources.",

These radars, example of which are Philips/Signaal's PILOT and Signaal's SCOUT coastal surveillance radars, pose a challenge to conventional EW support (EWS) receivers, which will typically detect the radar signal at ranges shorter than the radar detection range. This negative detection margin makes naval vessels such as submarines vulnerable to attack, since the radar can detect the periscope, other masts, or the sail, before the radar signal is detected and jammed. Technology Service Corporation (TSC) has investigated and developed a variety of LPI waveforms, as well as specialized feature detectors designed to intercept them. During Phase I of the present study, TSC proposes to investigate the feasibility of applying a variety of feature detection techniques, designed to detect the presence of a number of LPI waveforms, to an EWS receiver design concept that is built around a fast digital processor.

        "abstract": "Not Available  An available source of pure oxygen, usually in the form of high pressure oxygen gas in storage cylinders, is especially important for military aircraft crews. On-board generation of high- pressure oxygen gas can decrease the ground support requirements for military (and commercial) aircraft by reducing the need for high-pressure oxygen transfer cylinders. Following preflight validation and in-flight qualification, the proposed oxygen  trickle charger  may be used to automatically replace oxygen in storage cylinders that has been consumed by aircrew personnel and/or lost through system leaks. The use of a water electrolyzer system as a  trickle charger  is ideal since the oxygen is generated from easily obtained consumables (electricity and a small amount of water). Such a system may be arbitrarily cycled on and off, oxygen generation and pressurization is accomplished with a minimal number of moving components, and the system is essentially maintenance free. The proposed system is compatible with the rigors of flight, including altitude, temperature extremes, orientation, dynamic loading, and is fully capable of performing real-time on-board diagnostics. In addition, the system is compact, lightweight, reliable, has a relatively low electrical power demand, and requires no special handling. This Phase I project will result in the development and performance testing of a breadboard electrolyzer oxygen generation system having an output of 0.5 liters per minute at a pressure of 500 psi. The system will be tested at temperature extremes including starting from a frozen state. In preparation for the development of a high pressure system (2500 psi) in Phase II, critical design aspects will be addressed as part of the Phase I effort.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  There is an emerging class of post cold war airborne and groundbased military weapons and surveillance systems that will require unprecedented amounts of electrical power.  Unless high power electrical generators are developed that weigh no more than one fifth as much as the lightest available generators, these systems will not be possible.  While superconducting generator technology has always promised very lightweight generators, these devices have been too unreliable for military applications.  Many of the design problems were caused by using cryogenic rotors with warm (non-cryogenic) stators. Reliable cryogenic generators must use cryogenic stators and cryogenic rotors.  Advances in high temperature superconductors (and other cryogenic conductors) may finally allow us to build practical cryogenic generators.  This proposed SBIR program will design two one-megawatt cryogenic stators, using state-of-the-art conductor and cooling technology.  One stator will be designed for low voltage missions (50-200 volts) and the other will be designed for high voltage missions (10,000-20,000 volts).  The two interchangeable cryogenic stators will be designed to mate with a one-megawat HTS cryogenic rotor (being built by Heston Consulting in another BMDO SBIR program) to produce a complete cryogenic generator that is light, inexpensive and reliable enough for military applications.",

The SLM is driven electrostatically so that it draws virtually no power and provides pure analog phase modulation.  Analog phase modulation allows true signal processing in the Fourier domain which exceeds that possible with current binary modulators.  Most significantly the mirror motion is approximately 2 microns which corresponds to 6pi depth of modulation at 632.8 nanometers or 3 times that provided by today\u00bfs technology. The device is formed from a pixelated array of piston driven micro-mirrors each with a restoring spring made from polysilicon. The MEMS array planarity is dependent on the substrate which is nominally lambda/5 but will be significantly improved by a factor of four with COI\u00bfs precision polishing techniques. Planarity is essential in phase modulators when working with optical signal processing since any departure represents systematic error.  In order to contain costs we will use standard Commercial Off The Shelf processes to manufacture the device.  All the drive circuitry and sensor arrays will be manufactured separately using CMOS technology. The result is that processing algorithms can be implemented directly into the integrated circuit for pennies per chip.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  Among different methods using electomagnetic impact to disable radio-electronic devices the most effective one is the use of a series of video pulses of duration \u00bf 10 ns.  A series of such pulses with repetition rates of several hundred hertz lowers the sensitivity of protection circuits by up to two orders of magnitude.  We propose to use microwaves as a carrier frequency with video modulation.  Microwave radiation can be formed as a narrow wave beam that sufficiently increases the power flow on the target, consequently increasing the processes of rectification in the irradiated radioelectronic elements.  This combination of using a narrow directed wave beam with pulses of duration of about 10 ns will generate an effective tool for far distance disabling of electronic circuits.  A mobile device using a high-power L-band vircator already exists and operates in the single pulse regime.  However, the vircator cannot operate as a HPM generator of high rate repetition pulses because of the position of electrodes in the interaction space.  The proposed development of HPM X-band sources which are capable of operating at a high repetition rate, with bursts of short pulses and in automodulation regimes, will permit us to build a far distance HPM disabling device consisting of a system of focusing the wave beam and a high current electron gun able to operated at high repetition rate pulses.  In addition to functioning as an electromagnetic impact device such a set-up can also be used for distance testing of radioelectronic devices and as a nanosecond radar with high interference immunity and high resolution.",

The limitation on this bandwidth is the modulator design.  Current electro-optical modulators are limited to < 100 MHz.  However, by building an array of such modulators, we can taker advantage of the parallelism to effectively increase the bandwidth of the channel.  This means that instead of bit by bit serial encoding, we could use full word encoding.  This process is fully scalable as additional channels are added. We propose to develop one- and two dimensional optoelectronic modulator arrays that can be driven at up 1 GHz rate with TTL pulses.

Low thermal expansion NZP ceramics are choice candidates for this application because of their low conductivity, superior thermal shock resistance and their low elastic modulus. For commercial viability, the ceramic lined composite ports should be amenable to routine fabrication using processes such as metal casting. The high resistance to thermal shock of NZP is a big advantage in metal casting, however, mismatch of thermal expansions between the metal and NZP ceramic leads to failure-causing shrinkage stresses after complete cooling of the system. LoTEC, Inc. proposes to develop a commercially-viable technology involving NZP ceramic-lined exhaust and intake ports for advanced diesel engines. For routine fabrication using metal casting and reliability in application, the development and optimization process will be linked to several iterations of experimentation and engineering analysis.

The offeror's proposed design consists of the consolidation of high performance solid or semi-solid oxidizers into individual high density sealed packages. These packets would be stored in the oxidizer section of the rocket and could be delivered at a controlled rate to the hybrid combustion chamber. Throttling and start/stop capabilities which are inherent characteristics of hybrid propulsion systems would be realized in this design. Delivery of these packets could be accomplished by a number of means such as pyrotechnics and gas charge or either method in combination with acceleration forces. Geometry of the packages can be tailored to optimize packaging, structural efficiency, delivery systems and storage (pressurization). Storage, stability, safety and munition sensitivity could be improved while realizing the benefits of these high performance oxidizers. Hybrid propulsion systems offer a number of advantages over conventional solid motors when used in conjunction with high performance oxidizers. Because the oxidizer is stored separately from the fuel component until use, the need to compound the oxidizer with the appropriate fuel/binder system is eliminated. This is a definite advantage because high performance oxidizers such as HNF have been shown to react with a number of common curative agents used in solid propellant binder systems.

Several are human pathogens and may be a significant cause of acute febrile illness in endemic regions. Integrated Diagnostics currently distributes, on commercial and investigational bases, rapid dot ELISA dipstick (DS) diagnostic kits for detecting anti-rickettsial and ehrlichial antibodies. We propose to upgrade these devices by developing a more rapid, handheld format which requires only ambient temperatures for performance and reagent storage. Two formats, a modified DS and a lateral flow device, will be evaluated side by side. In Phase I, we will assess the performance of each device in detecting antibodies to one rickettsia, Orientia tsutsucamushi, and determine the feasibility of replacing lysed whole cell antigen with a recombinant O. tsutsunamushi antigen. Phase II will address incorporation of other (and multiple) rickettsial antigen specificities, production scale-up, and field testing. This work will result in a serological test better adapted to field situations and, like some of our current DS, capable of screening sera for a number of antibody specificities in a single test.

With the elimination of bias errors from flexure torques, it\u00bfs feasible to evacuate the accelerometer and reduce random walk to a negligible level. This allows the accelerometer to sense vibrations as well as very low frequency motions. The nano-g accelerometer will be capable of exhibiting high sensitivities, while at the same time be capable of measuring large input levels; which is not possible in traditional MEMS accelerometer designs. Consequently, the nano-g accelerometer will operate as a true inertial displacement sensor with displacement errors that are bounded over substantial time intervals.

The key reason for this increased demand is the potential benefits of spectral imagery to aid in target detection, specifically area anomalies, targets employing camouflage, denial and deception techniques, and the identification of natural and chemical effluence. Apectral imagery has the greatest potential to provide accurate data to the operators in an Automatic Target Recognition environment due to the ability to determine minute spectral differences between targets. Nonetheless, spectral based technology has not been widely accepted or utilized in the operational community. This is primarily due to system limitations in the literal image detection ranges, user experience, sensor limitations, availability of tactical sensor data, and validated exploitation tools and methods. It is the goal of this Phase I to determine a methodolgy and process to identify and evaluate (qualitatively and quantitatively) technological advances in the multi-to ultra-spectral exploitation arena.

        "abstract": "Not Available  Military information systems are becoming increasingly dispersed, appearing in weapon systems, satellites, and in the pockets and palms of combatants, they are perceiving the physical world closer than ever before, creating new opportunities for controlling the battlefield environment. In order to exploit these opportunities, information systems will need the ability to sense, compute, and act. This need is driving the development of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Employing the fabrication techniques and materials of microelectronics, MEMS processes construct both electrical and mechanical components. A novel approach for a bi-stable MEMS based latching microswitch is proposed permitting the latching microrelay to be fabricated as an integral part of the microsatellite system bus architecture. This new approach will enable the bus architecture to be reconfigured in the event of hardware failures or to switch in back-up systems. The presence of many DC capable microswitches will also enable a higher degree of flexibility to be built into the multifunctional structure. This permits a more generic architecture to be fabricated and then tailored to an application when the specific hardware is mounted on the substrate. The Phase II program will demonstrate the MFS system in an MCM package.",

However, most tomography work has focused on deep-water environments where the bottom interaction is insignificant. In shallow water, the bottom is the most significant environmental factor affecting sonar performance. The variability of the seabed properties far exceeds those experienced in water column, making the shallow water environmental assessment much more complex. Here, we propose to develop a new model-based approach based on identification of distinct time-angle properties of seabed reverberation which are hypothesized to uniquely characterize the seabed sound speed structure and the reverberation mechanism such as volume and surface scattering. Image processing techniques such as edge detection and template matching are used to detect the seabed characterizing features of the time-angle signal power. The algorithm is expected to be robust because the model matching is done in the signal power as opposed to phase sensitive algorithms such as Matched Field Processing.",

Prognostic algorithms will be chosen to represent two basic technology trends: model-based state estimation/filtering methods and  intelligent  data-driven techniques relying upon soft computing (neural networks, fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms). A key element of the Phase I effort is the transitioning of the prognostic/HSI concepts into the ICAS platform. This task will be facilitated by an open systems interface based on a novel Open Control Platform developed by Georgia Tech that supports such capabilities as play-and-play evolution, interoperability, dynamic reconfiguration and real-time quality of service. The framework for an assessment methodology will be developed by defining measures of effectiveness and performance for the prognostic and HSI modules. Software design and interface control documents will be used to demonstrate the selected concepts. Three shipboard systems - an industrial chiller, a gas turbine and a helicopter tail rotor failure - will constitute the testbeds for eventual implementation and proof-of-concept purposes.",

There are several novel aspects of the propose architecture.  It incorporates the basic reflex-type behaviors of reactive systems with goal directed behavior of deliberative systems.  It also offers a means for automatically programming the reflex behaviors.  Initially the behaviors are demonstrated by a supervisor so that the system can function in a rudimentary way.  The system then learns during operation from reinforcement provided by the supervisor.  The supervisor can also demonstrate new behaviors if the system becomes  stuck  during operations.  Secondarily, the supervisor also effects the learning rate by adjusting essential parameters.  However, this whole process is evolutionary.  The behaviors learned during one mission can be transferred to another mission so that supervisor interaction will become increasingly less necessary throughout the course of many similar missions.  During Phase I, IAI will demonstrate the system on a UGV performing a simple mission such as navigating an office hallway containing obstacles with the objective of entering an open office door.",

Students would be able to access reading and test materials over the Internet, create, edit and submit their responses, and receive instantaneous feedback. The underlying emphasis of the software would be on its user-friendliness for both instructors and students. During Phase 1, the feasibility of the concept will be demonstrated by developing a demo version of the software which has one fully-featured module.

Systems operating at liquid nitrogen temperature using superconducting wire with high engineering current densities will successfully enable these applications.

A low cost, thick film process incorporating advantages of existing laboratory methods will be demonstrated.  This approach combines the demonstrated high critical current densities of the ex situ BaF2 deposition approach with a proven commercial  non-vacuum deposition method for production of long lengths of YBCO superconducting tape.  The objective of the Phase I and II efforts is development of superior YBCO coated conductor to enable the demonstration of efficient, high power density power systems for airborne use.  The Phase I effort will demonstrate that this thick film deposition approach will produce YBCO films with superconducting performance comparable to benchmark vacuum and solution deposition processes.  A scaleable manufacturing process for the uniform deposition of the precursor over long lengths of substrate will be demonstrated.  The manufacturing robustness and cost benefits of the deposition approach over competing approaches will be assessed.",

It has also been concluded that in-situ deposition of carbon nitrides is also dependent on the substrate, which has prompted researchers to investigate structural templates such as ZrN, and TiN to force the growth of crystalline b-C3N4 films. However, the stability of this phase, interactions between carbon and nitrogen and newer applications for this material can be better understood with availability of pure crystalline B-C3N4 powders.

Compared to competing III-V (GaAs) photovoltaic cells, this cell is expected to provide nearly equivalent output power at about one-quarter of the cost.  Based on preliminary simulations, we expect that the cell will achieve 18.8% beginning-of-life (BOL) AMO efficiency.  Using SunPower\u00bfs experimentally validated degradation models for lifetime surface recombination velocity, and emitter saturation current, we predict 15.7% end-of-life (EOL) efficiency after 1E15/cm2 of 1 MeV electron irradiation.  At EOL, the cell is expected to provide over 80% of its BOL output power, making it as, or more, radiation tolerant than a typical GaAs/Ge cell.  The specific power of this cell is projected to be more than 1.0 kW/kg at EOL, which is significantly, better than competing III-V cells.  The cell design incorporates very thin float-zone (FZ) wafers with back-side point-contacts, similar to photovoltaic cells SunPower has commercialized for solar airplane and terrestrial concentrator applications.

Development of the proposed system would be of great value to microelectronic designers and test engineers, particularly during the development phase of radiation hardened devices. The proposed system is based on modification of an existing electro-optic probe station being commercialized by the proposing firm for non-contact wafer testing of micro-machined devices. The system architecture allows precise and reproducible positioning of the laser probe across a wafer with automated alignment and probe card positioning. During testing, the pulsed laser diode is positioned automatically to induce SEEs in sensitive areas of the device under test, and the response is monitored using standard IC testers. The Phase I effort will produce a functional prototype SEE Test system and tests performed to produce benchmark data of devices for which there is published SEE data obtained from accelerators for calibration of the testing results.

        "abstract": "Not Available  Ultra-Wideband (UWB) antennas for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been a challenge for some time, due to size and weight requirements. Such antennas can aid a number of missions in a cost-effective manner, including Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Foliage Penetration (FOPEN), Ground Moving Target Indicators (GMTI) and Counter-Camouflage Concealment and Deception (CC&D). UAVs have been shown to be a cost-effective method of carrying out these missions, but without the right antennas, these missions may fall short of their goals. The antennas required for these missions must be effective over a broad bandwidth, and they can induce only minimal drag on the surface of the aircraft. The frequencies of interest extend as low as 25 MHz. It is at the low end of the band where size constraints are most challenging. Obtaining a good antenna pattern is a challenge unless the antenna is the same size as a wavelength. Impedance matching over a broad bandwidth is also a challenge, because electrically small antennas normally have a matching circuit that provides a good match only within a very narrow band. Another challenge lies in steering the beam electronically. To address these challenges, we propose developing a crossed linear dipole array along the bottom of the fuselage and wing that is flush with the aircraft surface. We will explore antennas that reach as low as 25 MHz, with a decade of bandwidth. Designs that introduce minimal drag will be considered. We will calculate the antenna pattern, and we will calculate impedance match and radiation efficiency. We will also consider how to design systems with two polarizations. Finally, we will explore the patterns available after steering the beam using phase shifters. During Phase I we will build and test a scale model of a candidate array element.",

The catalytic activity of the enzyme will be tested against some simple variation of substrates to get an approximation of the binding preferences of the malarial SHMT.  At the same time, and RNA combinatorial library (SELEX) will be established to probe at and compare the active sites of host versus parasite metabolic enzymes.  For proof of principle, the RNA combinatorial system will first be applied to drug-sensitive malarial DHFR since this protein is known to bind certain antifolate 1,000 times more tightly than the host enzyme.  It is expected that the SELEX system will be able to identify RNA molecules that mimic the binding properties of drugs such as pyrimethamine.  Phase II will design biased combinatorial libraries of small molecules.BENEFITS:Successful outcome of phase I&II will lead to anti-malarial drug development which will overcome the problem of drug resistant malarial parasites.

        "abstract": "Not Available  Essential elements of today's highly mobile military services are effective mobile and temporary shelters. Increasingly, there is a demand for large, easily deployed, temporary shelters for many aspects of military activities. Current shelters are generally not well insulated resulting in large heating and cooling environmental controls units (ECU's). These ECU's have large power requirements and are bulky and heavy reducing mobility and consequently the effectiveness of mobile military units. The poor insulation results in an increased thermal signature leaving the shelters vulnerable to detection and targeting. Further, the limited insulation results in internal thermal gradients within the structure and condensation further eroding the concept's usefulness. L'Garde proposes solutions to these insulation problems through a technology commonly used in space programs, multi-layer insulation (MLI). Incorporating multi-layer insulation into temporary structures will greatly enhance environmental thermal control while concurrently addressing the thermal signature reduction. L'Garde, with 27 years of experience in inflatable space structures, RV decoys and targets with prerequisite signatures over multiple spectral bands, is well qualified to conduct this effort. Our experience with thermal control of inflatable decoys and experience working with thin films and membranes can be directly applied to enhancing the thermal efficiency of temporary shelters.

During operational deployments, these ECUs create a logistic requirement that is burdensome to the Army. What if there was a way to insulate these temporary structures in such a way as to reduce or eliminate the need for ECUs? At the same time, the thermal signature of the temporary structure could be negated, hiding it from an enemy's target list. Infinite Materials & Products, Inc., (IMP) believes that a flexible ceramic insulation material developed under contract to-the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization can be spray applied to the inside and/or outside of existing temporary shelters and tents to thoroughly insulate them to all climatic conditions, automatically blocking any heat signature and any sound created by the activity inside. IMP's insulation acts as a thermal sealant for the component, which is a completely different approach to simply filling the dead air space between structural members.  BENEFITS:  Since the insulation is spray applied, it can be used to add insulation capability to any habitable structure or vehicle, including ground, air, and sea applications.

The most promising concept is to temporally trap the particles in the rocket chamber so that the water present in the propellant gas can oxidize the carbon.  Another concept will involve passing the combustion gases through convoluted passages and trapping the carbon on the passage walls.  Techniques such as electrostatic filtration will be assessed to determine if they would aid in the process. Other techniques that will cause the particles to agglomerate will also be evaluated.

It is recognized that the design of components subjected to fatigue cannot be based on average material behavior but that designs must consider -3o or some other appropriate extreme value material properties. Thus, a life prediction capability useful in a design application must address the scatter inherent in material response to fatigue. The proposed effort will address the scatter in fatigue of gamma titanium aluminide by investigating the microstructural variables responsible for the scatter and developing analytical and semi-analytical models to quantitatively relate the variables to the response. The model is general and will consider the entire range of damage accumulation sequences; from crack nucleation of the initially unflawed structure to final fast fracture. However, the model will also allow failure to be defined as any subset of damage accumulation i.e., crack initiation life to a particular crack size or the number of cycles to grow a crack from a particular size to final fracture. The models will allow the structural engineer to systematically and quantitatively assess the influence of the material uncertainties on the overall reliability of the structure.",

Therefore, there exists a need to develop and integrate a  see and avoid  capability on current and future unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that is equivalent to manned aircraft.  Engineering 2000 addresses this requirement through this SBIR, titled:  The Development / Integration of Low Cost, Light Weight  See and Avoid  capability for UAVs.  LADAR/LIDAR technology will be used to detect obstacles within a full 360 degree sphere.  Collision avoidance steering will be attained through an interface with the UAVs autopilot.  Engineering 2000's experience with Fly-by-Light (FBL) technology will allow full optimization of benefits for improved UAV dispatchability and safety of flight.  This concept will allow reduction of engineering and lowered first costs, production, maintenance and operating costs will also result.",

To overcome coupling losses switching device will be engineered in such a way that it combines optical signal switching with optical gain in the switch.  This 2x2 optical switch would have a net, fiber to fiber gain.  Thus can be used as a building block to achieve loss less NxN array of optical switches.  Optical switches would be wavelength independent covering 40nm optical bandwidth of the material gain.  Switching time for this device would be lesser than 5-nsecs.

Our intention is to utilize data collected from our previous classroom research and apply it to our existing prototype while creating a carefully designed computer-based, teacher-directed classroom technology program. This technology works in tandem with standard school curriculum and supports reading, writing and literacy as well as technology skills in a safe and \"intelligent\" online environment. Using constructivist and systematic methodologies, in Phase 1, we create a full-scale curriculum model from which we then create the next series of Katland Komics Living Curriculum SEL content. In Phase II, we build the technology and beta test its effectiveness on targeted school populations, collaborating with the network of schools associated with national program leaders in the field. With Phase III, we market and distribute the software to schools. The program reaches its pinnacle when children \"read\" stories they \"write\" in the Katland Komics and Real-Life Books on the Internet and on bookshelves of libraries and bookstores.",

Currently, design of protective garments relies on slow and costly trial-and- error laboratory testing to assess performance.  The proposed project will develop advanced computational models for a clothed human that will enable the military to develop new and improved protective clothing more rapidly and less expensively.  The models utilize state- of-the-art computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software to model the transport and sorption of chemical agents and the heat transfer due to convective, diffusive, and phase change through the clothing layers. In Phase I, proof-of-principle models of a static clothed human will be developed and demonstrated   During Phase II, complete moving grid models for a clothed soldier will be developed. BENEFITS:  The proposed models will reduce the cost and time required to develop new protective garments while helping to improve their performance.  These models will have direct and immediate application in development of improved garments for protection from chemical threats and can be used in modeling other military clothing.  Commercially, the models have application in the design of industrial garments and advanced outdoor clothing.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  The proposed solution to ultra-fast concrete and steel cutting is to simultaneously increase hardness and toughness of a cutting tool. Novel cellular cermet cutting tool inserts offer an order of magnitude increase in cutting rates compared to traditional carbide or ceramic cutting tool inserts. The actual form of a cellular insert will be in form of a coating (between 0.5mm and 1mm thick) on a cutting face of a solid carbide insert. The cellular coating provides the fracture toughness, abrasion resistance, and resistance to chipping, while the solid carbide body underneath provides high flexural and compressive strength. This approach has already been demonstrated in ACR's work on oil well drill inserts with Smith International of Houston, TX, a leading manufacturer of oil exploration equipment. This collaboration has led to the development of drill inserts that allow well drilling in rock formations that were previously considered to be impossible to drill, such as granite. Both laboratory and field testing of novel cellular cermet drill bit inserts have demonstrated that a new paradigm in abrasive cutting is achievable through careful engineering of the microstructure of a cutting tool. More importantly, novel cellular cutting inserts can be effectively and inexpensively integrated into traditional portable devices, such as circular or chain saws.",

VLEITS is remarkably inexpensive because it requires no additional or special wiring other than that already typically installed for existing lighting fixtures. The network uses currently installed visible lighting, such as incandescent or fluorescent lighting, as the carrier medium for the data. The PID receives and displays control commands, text and graphics transmitted over ambient room lighting. The system varies the light output of lighting fixtures to transmit data at a sufficiently rapid rate that there is no perceptible visual flicker in light output or loss in light efficiency. Data encoded in the lamp light is sent to a small information receiver that presents text and graphic information to students or occupants of a building. The system will be developed in connection with experts on education of the handicapped and will be evaluated and tested by these users to maximize user-friendliness and value. This proposal seeks funding to develop a high quality PID and a transmitter capable of providing data to the PID via ambient light.",

The ability to accomplish extremely accurate en-route, targeting, and terminal operations based upon precision navigation has become an assumption of battle planning and warfighting operations.

Fully exploiting its capability while ensuring the integrity of the navigation solution is the precision navigation imperative. Differential GPS has been selected by the DoD's Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS) program for implementation of the JPALS. The DoD recognizes that certain attributes of current, commercial differential GPS system require augmentation to establish navigation integrity for mission critical operations. The DoD's Multi-function Information Distribution System (MIDS) provides a secure communication link and relative navigation capability that can augment GPS for improved integrity and survivability of precision navigation operations. Phase I Tasking that investigates MIDS as a potential communication link for differential corrections, examines the optimal integration of MIDS, GPS, and INS data for a more robust nav solution, and explores the use of ground-based MIDS in conjunction with GPS as a secure back-up for differential GPS-based precision approach and landing systems is provided.",

The anticipated result of the innovative research proposed by Aerospace Research Corporation is an intellignet software product that is bound to revolutionize the prediction of combustion instability in gas turbine engines by radically reducing the model solution time, effort, and cost. The calculation methods have been carefully chosen to give very accurate results in a timely manner. Furthermore, the product is very flexible because it will run on sequential as well as on a range of parallel computers. Modereately large models can be analyzed very cheaply on a cluster of personal computers (PCs), while larger models can be run on a cluster of Unix Workstations or on parallel supercomputers. The dramatic reduction in turn-around ensures much quicker and cheaper design cycles, and both the DOE's ATS and the DOD's IHPTET programs will benefit. Finally, the product will enhance the profitability of numerous commerical industries that currently use the CFD technology for competitive advantage",

        "abstract": "Not Available Achieving greater levels of independence for individuals with mental retardation depends upon a number of key skiffs that must be learned to a proficiency level. One of the significant barriers that exists for individuals with cognitive limitations is time management and adhering to a schedule. The ability to reliably perform tasks according to a schedule is a key to independent living, e.g., taking correct medications on time, and for maintaining employment, e.g. getting to work on time or knowing when to move on to the next task. People with mental retardation are often quite limited in time management skills. The proposed research will demonstrate the application of a portable device designed to increase independence and self-determination in time management for individuals with mental retardation. The long-term objective is to develop Schedule Assistant, a pocket-sized Windows CE based software system for providing automated schedule management support. The Schedule Assistant system will generate automated onscreen visual prompts using color pictures in combination with audio prompts using digitally recorded verbal messages in response to a time-based schedule of events to help the user maintain a schedule and perform time-sensitive vocational tasks. The research focus is on building and field testing a Schedule Assistant prototype to assess its effectiveness for improving independence in meeting time requirements in scheduled tasks, and reducing supervision requirements for individuals with mental retardation. The Schedule Assistant prototype will benefit from other research projects conducted by AbleLink staff under previously funded NIDRR grants. Specifically, the development effort for the Schedule Assistant prototype will be build on work done in developing Visual Assistant, a Windows CE based training tool for teaching community-based vocational tasks. In this project the Schedule Assistant requirements will be identified, followed by development of a software prototype that can be used to test the Schedule Assistant concept in the Phase I pilot test. Field testing in Phase I will be in coordination with Colorado Springs School District # 11's Transition Program and Cheyenne Village, an adult service agency for individuals with disabilities.",

To meet the cleaning requirements of current and future weapon systems, environmentally and health compliant cleaners are needed. A considerable amount of progress has been made in the industry during the last decade in developing environmentally friendly cleaners. Some of these cleaners may be suitable for cleaning weapon systems. However, systematic analysis through controlled cleaning tests needs to be performed to rank the commercially available cleaners. In Phase I, we propose to determine the cleaning requirements of weapon systems, test various cleaning formulations and rank them according to their effectiveness, cost and environmental, health and safety aspects. In Phase II, final selection of the cleaner will be made by further tests on reliability, potential damage upon long term exposure to aerospace materials, and cost-effectiveness.

It extends the concept of band-gap engineering of heterostructures by tailoring of optical or transport properties through choice of materials, modulation doping, strain, and external electric or magnetic fields. We propose developing software tools to achieve such design optimization and simulation for quantum wells, wires, and dots using tight-binding and finite element modeling. Our sparse matrix algorithms will be used so that complex structures can be modeled with ease. A very preliminary version of the proposed software has led to the successful wavefunction engineering of quantum inter-band cascade lasers using InAs/GaSb/AlSb operating at 3-5 microns. A full-featured software will reduce the time for the design, growth, testing & production cycle very substantially. By providing a computational environment for simulation of quantum devices it will permit the exploration of novel electronic mechanisms for semiconductor devices.",

By drawing on our experience developing intrusion detection systems, statistical analysis tools, and model-based reasoning techniques, we propose to provide system administrators with a powerful unified risk management tool for heterogeneous networks of computers.  In this task we draw inspiration from the success of automated medical diagnosis systems that utilize diverse diagnostic measures and an understanding of subsystem interactions in order to assess a patient's condition.  In particular, our tool will detect and assess strategic vulnerabilities through the correlation of evidence from: COTS configuration examination applications, statistical analysis of previous incidents, intrusion detection techniques, and predictive analysis.  The resulting system will be capable of accurately estimating the risks facing a network and identifying appropriate risk balancing measures.  Finally, our system will be linked with our ICE intrusion detection system to facilitate the identification of previously unrecognized vulnerabilities and to provide continuous risk monitoring capability.  The prototype tool developed in our Phase I effort will prove the feasibility of our approach and provide the basis for a complete Phase II implementation of SecureE(StratEgiC vUlneRability Evaluator).",

Since the probe fiber can be made very long, the probe itself would be highly adaptable to different mounting configurations and environments such as watertight windowless containers and military aircraft. The optical nature of the measurement would make it immune to electromagnetic interference, electrical discharges, and water. Using very sensitive, low-noise detectors, the system could obtain thermal data at rates up to 1MHz, sufficient to characterize dynamic processes like explosions. The control chassis itself would support multiple probes, so that three-dimensional data could be obtained by placing several probes at different locations. By providing rapid, accurate, 3-D data, a system such as this could be a key element in any developmental or diagnostic system where fast thermal dynamics are involved.",

NAVSYS proposes to develop a digital beamforming antenna array that can provide all-around GPS satellite visibility from a spinning space-vehicle and will also provide gain directivity to the GPS satellites. This approach leverages the commercial digital GPS antenna array that has already been developed by NAVSYS and has demonstrated 10 dB gain improvements for tracking GPS satellites. We will also leverage our experience with spaceborne antennas and GPS tracking from the Falcon Gold Experiment. This used a NAVSYS' antenna and GPS sensor (TIDGET\u00bf) to show that the GPS signals could be received at altitudes from 1500 to 33000 km.

However, the success of any optimal Bayes technique hinges on a number of subtle issues and in recent years shortcoming in conventional Bayesian thinking have become evident. In response to these, the SSCI-LMTDS approach is capable of addressing: (1) the ambiguity that is present in real-world ATR problems involving sources such as SAR, HRR, and datalink messages; (2) the real-time computational issues in single-target filtering, especially in low-SNR regimes; and (3) the unique conceptual and computational difficulties associated with optimal multitarget filtering.

Halonr 1202, or bromodifluoroethane, is stored under pressure for use as a fire suppressant in these systems. The packing materials currently used to support this application have been found to deteriorate at an unacceptable rate, causing the seals to fail under pressure and allowing the Halonr gas to escape to the atmosphere.

Models to assist in filtering and understanding the fast array of data that is collected across many different factors regarding terrorist activities will be designed using evolutionary algorithms.  Success in Phase I sets the stage for generating more detailed models in Phase II to assay  what if  conditions and anticipate possible actions and reactions to terrorist activities.",

These tools can assist performance and problem evaluation of weapon system, support and other application tasks, and may consist of knowledge-based and intelligent system technologies such as expert systems, neural networks, fuzzy logic, and genetic algorithms, as well as statistical methods and process. Such extensive data and investigate capabilities will support large-scale longitudinal and other analysis of UUT and ATE performance and problems to an extent that was previously unavailable. The key to the effectiveness of these tools is the development of a common paradigm for representing the data in a manner that provides seamless data access regardless of the inferential or computational method used in it analysis. This approach also overcomes physical limitations, such as geographical location, that may be associated with data collection and dissemination. Validation of the proposed approach through the development of prototype intelligent analysis tools is demonstrated.",

The deposited ploymers will be characterized using the appropriate techniques that will help identify and determine ferromagnetic and electrical characteristics.

The phase margin of the AFS control loops and the closed loop damage of critical modes are highlighted as critical parameters to be monitored. Sources of destabilizing phase lag will be identified and quantified, such as dynamic pressure changes and, importantly, actuator rate limiting.

Decision analysis provides a framework for this prediction, which can be depicted through decision/outcome diagrams. As such, it can be used to determine which attributes of the diagnostic techniques most influence the cost and should therefore be considered as metrics for comparative evaluation of the algorithms. Measuring the identified attributes of CBM techniques can be difficult, as extensive real-world testing can be quite time consuming and prohibitively expensive. Methods like the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) can be used to quantify expert knowledge about equipment and techniques, and provide a means of obtaining good estimates regarding quantities needed to assess both CBM techniques and the equipment monitored by them. Even crude estimates often lead to cost savings through decision analysis. It is proposed to use decision analysis and AHP together in a framework to identify and measure suitable metrics for CBM technologies, and to test this framework on simulated machinery.

Computer automation and optimization of the process will improve efficiency by reducing the labor needed to prepare the schedules. Computerized scheduling could also find opportunities in those cases where emergencies or other anomalies require that the schedule be reworked quickly.

Current micro-doppler measurement concepts are limited at long range by a number of noise sources: optical path fluctuations due to advection of turbulence through the lidar beam, line-of-sight jitter, time varying speckle induced by both the relative motion between the target and the observer and by rotational motions of the target, and shot noise.

        "abstract": "Not Available  The diode-pumped atomic vapor laser is a novel type of laser which takes advantage of the efficiencies of semiconductor lasers to provide a compact, efficient laser source capable of high power at blue and ultraviolet wavelengths, as well as red and infrared. In this laser, two semiconductor lasers at different wavelengths are used to excite atoms in a vapor cell to a high energy state. Photons are emitted when the atoms return to a lower state. Placing the cell in an optical resonant cavity produces a laser. The primary objective of this research is to demonstrate the principle of a diode-pumped atomic vapor laser by building a 761 nm laser using a cesium vapor cell with 852 nm and 794 nm semiconductor lasers for pumping. Measurements will be made of peak power, efficiency, and beam quality. After initial measurements are made, further tuning and measurements will be done to optimize the results. Once this is successful, preliminary work will begin on modifying the setup to produce a blue, UV, or mid-infrared laser.",

Basic research has defined the physical and ergonomic parameters of many of these technologies. However, a gap exists between laboratory research and  real-world  testing. Outstanding expensive  simulators  exist, but a lower-cost, operationally valid simulation device is needed, capable of providing mission-related predictions of the impact of proposed control/display technologies. The effort will integrate a high-fidelity aeromodel into a motion-based simulator to answer this need. Operationally meaningful performance assessment metrics will also be included. The Phase I output will include complete designs and software specifications for developing a motion-based, aerodynamically realistic simulation of the F-16 aircraft, and a software interface capable of accepting many anticipated alternative control/display technologies envisioned for the aero- and space-environments. The proposed design is  generic  in that is can be easily adapted to other aircraft, many control/display technologies, and space applications with a minimum of modifications. Therefore, the commerical applications of this development extend to civil aircraft, all forms of transportation (cars, busses, trains) design of controls and displays in nuclear power plants, and the design of workplaces in any safety-sensitive environment.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  Rapid advances in GPS technology and the development of micro-mechanical inertial sensors have made it feasible to develop low-cost/high-accuracy navigation systems for applications such as the guidance of precision munitions. While the integrated GPS/INS technology offers an inexpensive navigation solution, the weapons systems relying on this technology are susceptible to jamming from external sources. If the jamming sources are localized, it is feasible to direct the flight vehicle in such a way as to shield the GPS antenna from jamming sources during its flight towards the target. Since this would involve the synergistic control of the vehicle flight path and attitude, the resulting control task is an integrated guidance-autopilot logic synthesis problem. This proposal advances tow approaches for deriving solutions to this integrated guidance-autopilot problem. Phase I research will demonstrate the integrated design methodology, and will illustrate the performance of the body-shading guidance-autopilot logics using a six degrees-of-freedom precision munitions simulation. Phase I research will also identify the sensor and estimation requirements for implementing the body-shading guidance technology. Phase II work will apply the integrated guidance algorithm to precision munitions identified by the Air Force. Application of advanced signal processing methodologies will also be explored during Phase II research.",

His method allows controlling combustion in two distinct stages and is suitable for insertion in current CI engines. A portion of the compressed air from the cylinder with fuel added is delivered to a thermal injector to form a homogeneous mixture. The heat by compression ignites the mixture which is then isolated by a control system; this system also controls a valve to open near TDC to discharge the burning fuel into the cylinder and complete the combustion process. Earlier experiments confirmed the feasibility of this concept. Computer modeling with the KIVA-3 code will be used to simulate the basic features of this combustion method and to provide relevant data on the physical processes involved and on the operational features: control issues; fuel preparation; mixing; overall efficiency. This will include a study of the design of the control system; testing of the thermal injector component; and a study for selecting and retrofitting an engine to be used for experimental testing.

Although it has the potential to revolutionize control technology the industry acceptance of the technique has been slow. The primary reason appears to be due to the fact that it is computationally expensive to implement. This proposal advances the development of a software/hardware solution that will enable the rapid design and deployment of the SDRE control method in general purpose applications. The proposed systems will be configured using commercial off-the-shelf subsystems, and C/C++ software during Phase I research. Phase I research will demonstrate the prototype software/hardware solution. The commercialization of the technology will also be initiated during the Phase I research. Phase II work will develop a software/hardware solution that can be used in hardware-in-the-loop simulations, in the geometric form-factor suitable for eventual use as a flight-test article. The software/hardware solution will be specialize to an Air Force identified airframe and real-time operation will be demonstrated during Phase II work. This SDRE solution will be further developed into a flight-test article during Phase II research.",

In this regard, electrochromic materials have been demonstrated which exhibit deep modulation over a broad region of the electromagnetic spectrum. We propose here a new concept in electrochromic coatings for producing uniform, flexible, long cycle life, environmentally robust electrochromic cells for surface application. The innovation is based on using flexible polymeric materials for the components of the charge balanced electrochromic cell elements. The electrochromic layers will comprise organic, inorganic and mixed materials prepared by controlled surface coating processes. The overall objective of Phase I is to determine the feasibility of electrochromic materials and electrochemical pixel cell configurations for providing a three color variable camouflage element. The work will encompass a survey of new multicolor electrochromic polymers developed at EIC Laboratories and, through a subcontract, by the Reynolds group at the University of Florida. Phase II entails scale-up of flexible pixel elements to provide fully matrix addressed, environmentally robust appliques for spatially varying active signature control.

Their simplicity, ruggedness and reliability recommend them over older technology.  Innovative improvements (the double inlet, the inertance tube) have brought orifice pulse tube cooler performance into the range of Stirling and Gifford-McMahon coolers.  Double inlets and inertance tubes improve phasing of flows at the warm end of a pulse tube.  However, both double inlets and inertance tubes are bulky and, in some respects, balky.  The double inlet approach requires careful calibration of the bypass flow between compressor and pulse tube.  DC flow is possibe, and common.  The double inlet does not always work well, or at all.  Inertance tubes work well only with relatively large pulse tube coolers running at relatively high speeds.  Efficiency of all regenerative coolers remains far below Carnot limits and much more improvement is possible.  This proposal applies the magnetocaloric effect to modify flow phasing of a pulse tube cryocooler.  It offers a compact, simple improvement with no moving parts.",

The proposed vibration control strategy relies on the vibrational energy management concept.  The vibration control system will be comprised of both passive and active elements which each will have two functions.  The passive elements will be utilized for energy dissipation at high frequencies and energy absorption at resonance frequencies of the skin structure.  Constrained layer damping and tunned-mass dampers will be the initial candidates for passive elements during the feasibility study.  The active elements will dissipate energy at low frequencies and steer vibrational energy to specified regions at which excess energy can be most effectively absorbed or dissipated by passive or active elements.  PZT-based actuators will be the initial candidates for active elements.  The proposed smart skin structures will have the capability of steering their excited vibration energy in the most efficient and effective manner in order to minimize the damaging efforts and/or radiated noise of propagating vibrations.  In Phase I, the feasibility of the proposed smart load-bearing skin structure will be demonstrated on a flat panel.  A computer model will be used to show that is  possible to construct a panel with embedded vibrational energy steering capability which is the novel part of our work.",

Our system makes use of a (mid-wave infrared) sensitive CCD camera and sophisticated image processing software to passively detect suspended cables. Under some conditions, it is expected that an active source will be required for cable illumination, hence, the dual nature of our system. Cables are actively located by scanning the field-of-view with a laser beam, imaging the scattered light with the same CCD camera used in the passive system, and processing the data. In addition to being able to alert the pilot to the presence of a cable, the active system permits ranging so that the distance to the cable becomes known. Our system will be able to examine at least a 10-degree field-of-view and be able to detect a 1-cm diameter wire at a range of greater than 600 m in a time less than 1 second.",

Key to this system will be the use of computational modeling inconjunction with the development of advanced instrumentation. The modeling program will consist of two portions. First, a combustor kinetics code willbe implemented to predict combustor performance and emissions with higher hydrocarbon fuels, with calculations being applied both to the combustion tube of a pulse detonation engne and to a high-equivalence-ratio gas-turbine combustorwithconventional jet fueland air. Secod, a multi-dimensional computational code will be implemented to study important spatial and temporal behavior of relevance to instrumentation designand application. Advanced instrumentation willalso be demonstrated after choosing the most relevant techniques. A demonstration measurement of pressure and temperature is planned usng the dual-pump CARS technique. In addition, filtered Rayleigh scattering and laser-induced fluorescence will be applied. In each case, the test will be performed on a laboratory researc combustor. A fiber-optic-based probe willalso bedesigned for concentration measurements in cases where optical access is limited.",

Recent results by researchers at Sentor Technologies Inc. have demonstrated the potential for an entirely new class of gamma radiation detector based on microwave photo-conductivity.  The contactless  MiRaD  detector can detect and quantify gamma-ray interactions in a material without directly collecting secondary particles and promises to offer properties far surpassing anything currently available.

The proposed research will test the algorithms using simulated data to establish baseline performance and real data to validate the algorithm against a realistic environment. DSR has developed an Engagement Defense Tracking Model (EDTM) that will be used to provide a realistic simulation of the track association process; realistic simulation is essential to the development of enhanced tracker concepts.

Prototype actuators have been 1/2 mm tall bumps fastened to the stator blades. These bumps must be deployable, varying their deployment with engine RPM. The existence of MEMS technology provides a potentially versatile solution, which may enable us to reduce the drag cost of wake modification.

Following a comparative analysis of computer switch interface capabilities and software with built-in scanning requirements, the prototype MultiSCAN 2000 software will be reviewed by a national panel of experts in single-switch applications and demonstrated thoroughly in the field. Given evidence of scientific and technical feasibility in Phase 1, a series of fully featured switch training software activities and a manual for teachers and students will be produced in Phase II emphasizing clear concise training strategies to assess students' level of functioning and promote single-switch skill development beyond cause-and-effect and simple scanning toward more powerful, abstract, multifunction access technologies.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  Rapidly tunable lasers are essential for diffractive beam steering and for the detection of clandestine chemical emissions, chemical and biological warfare agents as well as concealed combustion engines or rocket propellents from missiles.  The success of operation of such detection systems depends critically on the rapid tunability and  performance of the proposed laser.  We will develop a high repetition rate (~1KHz), frequency agile (3-\u00bfm) , rapidly tunable (few KHz), 10mJ/pulse quasi phase-matched optical parametric oscillator (OPO), pumped by a diode pumped Yb: YAG tunable laser.  Compactness and broad IR tuning range are obrained by utilizing a fixed PPRTA OPO and tuning the pump wavelength.  Rapid tuning in MWIR (3-5-\u00bfm) is achieved through rapid tuning of Yb:YAG laser.  In the proposed Yb:YAG  laser a non-mechanical tuner based on a nonlinear optical crystal is used to obtain high speed tuning without compromising its ruggedness or performance.  Employing all solid state technology from the pumping source to frequency tuner to frequency converter the proposed system is truly a versatile laser which can meet the rigor of  a battle field or commercial operations.  In Phase I, we will demonstrate high energy, rapid tuning, high repetition rate operations.  In Phase I, we will demonstrate high energy, rapid tuning, high repetition rate operation of a MWIR OPO pumped by a Yb: YAG laser.",

Quoin will analyze the concept of an actuator based on a central air compressor and distributed hot gas actuators - each with a small pulse burner.  A single unit will be built in Phase I.  The central power unit provides up to 1,500 watts of output in the form of compressed gas.  This gas is distributed to feed control valves, which then feed micro burners.  These burners increase the energy of the gas by a factor of 7-10 as they introduce and burn hydrocarbon fuels.  The high pressure, high temperature gas drives a reversing turbine that, combined with a reduction gear set and a ball-screw, forms the high-energy dense actuator.  This provides an exoskeleton with a highly responsive, small actuator and power supply package with extremely high power density.

However, much needed user-friendly characterization techniques for this new class of materials have not been developed. Traditional methods, used for submicron powders are not always suitable for nanomaterials, because of inherent limitations. In this program we propose to develop and deliver a generic and user-friendly bench-top Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) system, with proprietary data analysis software designed specifically for nanomaterials. SAXS can yield accurate information on particle characteristics, such as size, size distribution. Morphology, thickness of surface layer, extent of agglomeration, and surface area. In addition, sintered materials can also be characterized. The ultimate objective is that the instrument be used by an individual who is not a trained scatterer. Sample nanopowders of metals and ceramics will be characterized by SAXS in Phase I, and the instrument will be packaged in Phase II of else program. The instrument will be sold on a commercial basis in Phase III of the program.  BENEFITS:  Instruments needed to characterize nanopowders on a routine basis, have not kept pace with the development in nanoparticle production technologies. The instrument that we propose to develop in this program is designed to address this issue. If successful, every nanopowder production",

Additional dedicated sensors can also be added as required that are embedded in the soldier's equipment. Both the indirect sensors and optional dedicated sensors can be interfaced with wireless personal networks.

        "abstract": "Not Available  Modern satellite-communication transmitters use a single antenna array to form multiple beams. Each power-amplifier (PA) module must amplify multiple carriers simultaneously. The resultant high peak-to-average ratio causes conventional PAs to be very inefficient (5-10 percent). Kahn-technique (EER) transmitters combine nonlinear RF amplifiers with a high-level modulator to implement a high-efficiency linear transmitter. Such transmitters have recently been demonstrated from HF (250 W) through L band. Their average efficiency for multiracial signals is typically several times that of a conventional linear amplifier (e.g., 50-60 percent). Unfortunately, existing modulator designs limit the bandwidth to 50 to 100 kHz. This program will investigate techniques for wideband high-efficiency amplification. The preferred technique uses a high-level modulator that combines a class-S modulator with a class-B amplifier. The class-S modulator amplifies the low-frequency components of the envelope (which constitute most of the power). The class-B amplifier adds the high-frequency components. The result is a transmitter which is nearly as efficient as a Kahn-technique transmitter, but can operate with bandwidths suitable for satcom and other multicarrier applications. The Phase-I program will identify the preferred approach and determine its parameters.",

(SOS) will use its existing phonetic speech recognition (SPRS) tool kit to develop an advanced audio interface for speech recognition in a high noise military environment. A requirement exists for audio command, control, and communications systems in a noisy environment based on natural interfaces, such as speech recognition, which require no training for efficient intuitive operation. That existing speech recognition systems fail in even moderate noise environments was identified as a critical issue at the military workshop on Spoken Human-Machine Dialogue in 1995. As a potential SOS product, noisy speech recognition is of great commercial value in vehicles, offices and factories. To reduce noise effects in speech recognition, SOS will modify the SPSR processing in three ways: Add an adaptive filter to remove noise prior to speech processing; compute auditory based EIH data to create robust speech recognition features; and apply a genetic optimization algorithm imitating the human evolution of speech to improve noise rejection. These changes will be tested, with both off the shelf commercial speech software and the SPSR system, in a digital audio laboratory with controlled speech and noise to evaluate affects on speech recognition performance.",

A revolutionary technology for fabrication of semiconductor materials which nonlinearity is increased in 10\u00bf-10\u00bf times providing sensitivity of 1m W/mm\u00bf will be developed and used in the device design.  An all-fiber-in-line version of the component uses resonance evanescent coupling between a side polished single-mode fiber and a high-index multimode nonlinear waveguide.  In a compact integrated optical version of the components, the developed technology will be used for selective processing of semiconductor based Mach-Zehnder modulators and directional couplers in order to enhance their nonlinearity.  Phase I of the program will address to developing and demonstrating the proposed technology for fabrication of the all-optical components.

To implement a radio link, the radio transmitter output power must be sufficiently large to overcome the signal absorption in the ground. The radio signal absorption in the ground has been studied in the past, and a preliminary data base has been established. For direct assessment of penetrating weapons, however, a transmitter designed specifically for this application is desired. This proposal describes an approach to design and demonstrate a transmitter suitable for applications in penetrating weapons. Problems and issues unique to this application include: G-hardening and frequency stability during the penetration phase, frequency selection for optimum signal transmission, and the power output estimated to acquire and maintain a link. The proposed approach is to design a single transmitter signal source into a single chip and combine it with a power amplifier operating at output levels of 100 watts or more. The preferred frequency of what operation is in the VHF ban of 225-300 MHz. The operating scenario assumes that there will be an airborne receiver in a relay station deployed near the penetrating point. The signal loss from the transmitter to the receiver is expected to be of 140dB. A directive antenna conformal to the penetrating body is assumed for the transmitter. The propose",

In practice, almost 100% of M&S systems are custom software driven by domain and mission-specific requirements. Mission changes result in system requirement change and thus integration of new capabilities is the most significant problem. The promise of component-based M&S systems is to enable developers and end-users to  snap together  new applications by mixing and matching external simulation data and components. A major innovation of this effort is the design of universal M&S data exchange language based on eXtensible Markup Language (XML). The major capabilities of the M&S data exchange language are (1) new M&S language terms can be added without effecting the reliability of existing terms; (2) term structures can be nested to any level of complexity; (3) any M&S data object can contain an optional description of its grammar. Another major innovation dynamic (run-time) transformation of legacy M&S software interfaces into standards-based services. The result is the ability to adapt quickly to different user and mission demands, while achieving reliability through the reuse of verified components.",

This process will also enable numerous nano-powder compositions that are inaccessible by conventional techniques.  In Liquid Combustion Vapor Condensation (LCVC), low-cost, environmentally friendly, metal-bearing reagents are dissolved in solvents that also serve as compustible fuel.  Using MCT'S innovative nebullizer, this solution is atomized to form submicron droplets, which are then combusted in a torch, forming vapor.  The condensable species thus formed nucleate homogeneously as aerosol nano-powders that are then collected in dispersion media.  Premixed precursor solutions allow great versatillity in synthesizing a wide variety of compound nano-powders of very uniform size and composition.  The LCVC method will be developed to produce nano-powders that will be collected as colloidal dispersions, a convenient form for handling and subsequent processing.  The powders will be characterized for microstructure, stoichiometry and physical properties as a function of process variables.  Applications will be developed in near net shape ceramics, powder coating, and rheological fluids.  Success will lead to a Phase II, tens of kilograms per hour capable, effort to scale and optimize the LCVC process for low cost production of nano-powders in Phase III.",

Polycrystalline SiGe is a promising alternative for gate contacts in MOSFETs, with useful properties including the ability to manipulate work function of the contact, enhanced dopant activation, and lower boron diffusion rates. Polycrystalline SiGe and silicon with low carbon (0.05-0.2%, denoted as SiGe : C and Si : C) should inhibit boron diffusion/penetration. As gate oxide thickness shrinks in higher frequency devices, inhibition of boron penetration from polycrystalline gated during high temperature processing is a limiting issue in MOSFETs. Recently, small amounts of carbon in silicon and SiGe layers have domonstrated significantly inhibited boron diffusion. The most common means to reduce boron penetration is nitridation of the gate oxide, which may be less radiation hard. Additionally, as dielectric thickness decreases, nitrided layer thickness also shrinks, reducing its effect as a diffusion barrier. Suppression of boron penetration may ultimately require both nitrided gated dielectrics and carbon doped polycrystalline electrodes. The primary goals are to determine the effect of carbon and thermal processing on boron penetration through the gate oxide, polycrystalline layer morphology and the capacitance voltage (CV) properties of the gate stack before and after radiation testing.",

Compact, lightweight and efficient microwave power amplifiers are needed for BMDO mobile radar systems application. GaN HFET has been demonstrated under the sponsorship of a BMDO program to have excellent micorwave characterization for X band applications \u00bf with much improved power density and thermal characteristics. This technological achievement in GaN based HFET suggests a potential major advance for high efficient, high power microwave amplifiers for application in lightweight phase array radars and mobile communications systems.  In Phase I, we will study the design and assess the feasibility of prototyping the amplifier and the potential power performance for BMDO\u00bfs applications as well as for other defense and civilian sectors. Our plans also include the follow-on Phase II program in forming a joint business venture with a Los Angeles based company for prototype demonstration. Likewise, we have in plan to work on the manufacture of GaN HEMT\u00bfs with a major RF semiconductor manufacturer",

Site model information and contextual evidence will be incorporated to quantify the confidence in the detection.  Temporal trends will be computed using dynamic systems analysis and observer-predictor systems to evaluate the plausibility of a given detection.

Reliable manufacturing of advanced SOI-based products requires accurate characterization tools. Presently, the semiconductor industry lacks the necessary instrumentation to non-destructively characterize and qualify SOI wafers with silicon layers thicker than several microns. To meet the demand, a joint venture of On-Line Technologies Inc. and ADE Corporation will develop a combined thick-film SOI characterization tool employing FTIR reflectometry and multi-laser light scatterometry. The system will be able to 1) measure thicknesses of the top silicon and the buried oxide (BOX) layers, resistively and macro-defect concentration in the silicon layer, density of the BOX layer, 2) evaluate the integrity of the interface bond between the silicon film and the BOX layer, and 3) detect defects generated by the wafer treatment. Three innovations will be combined in this project to render infrared practical for SOI characterization: 1) A breakthrough optical system from On-Line Technologies, eliminating spectral artifacts arising from the wafer backside reflections, and providing significantly higher accuracy than conventional FTIR. 2) Multi-layer model-based analysis software providing a flexible way to deduce unknown parameters of interest from the reflectance spectra. 3) Multi-spectral (visible and near-IR) laser scatterometry capable of probing both surface and buried interface quality. Phase I will demonstrate the ability of the proposed technique to non-destructively characterize the key properties of thick-film SOI. A system design for Phase II will be proposed.",

Applied Technology Associates (ATA) proposes the Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Inertial Reference Unit (MIRU) to meet the requirement. The MIRU will integrate innovative and emerging technologies of inexpensive, low-noise inertial sensors, electromagnetic actuators, electronics, and state-of-the-art digital processors and software to address the Air Force need. In the past year, ATA has achieved technology advances in MHD-based inertial angular motion sensing that directly contribute to the feasibility of developing the MIRU. ATA Sensors, the Company's commercial division, completed the design, manufacture, and successful market introduction of the Model ARS-12. This innovative product possesses the appropriate size, bandwidth, measurement noise and dynamic range, power consumption, ruggedness, and cost characteristics desired for an aircraft optical reference unit. The MIRU will use the model ARS-12 as the basis for achieving the requisite isolation of the telescope's optical line-of-sight (LOS) from the aircraft base motion, i.e., LOS jitter at 3 microradians or less. Other direct lessons learned and technology foundations from ATA's support to the Air Force High Altitude Balloon Experiment (HABE) will be exploited in constructing the MIRU.",

POFs are potential candidates in short-haul (1000 m or less) telecommunication applications such as local area networks. Currently low bandwidth copper wires are used, which cannot support the bandwidth requirements of multimedia and internet technologies. Gradient Index POFs with a bandwidth of over 2.5 Gbits/sec have recently been fabricated, which will be enough to support most of the telecommunication applications. However, attenuation of polymers is very high at 1.55 micrometers, where most long distance fiber optic systems operate. Inexpensive polymeric optical amplifiers need to be developed to extend the operational range of POFs. MTI is proposing to develop inexpensive erbium (III) ion doped POF/waveguide amplifiers by either functionalizing or doping the amorphous fluoropolymers with erbium complexes. Multilayered fluoropolymer-erbium complex thin film waveguides will be fabricated using proprietary technique. The fluorescence lifetime of the erbium- polymer materials will be optimized from various proposed fluoropolymer- erbium complex compositions. Both fiber and waveguide optical amplifiers will be fabricated and tested. Optical gains of the amplifiers will be determined. Thermal stability and laser damage threshold of the amplifiers will also be studied.",

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), in response to the demands of industry, has published two  integrated services  (Intserv) standards that define additional service classes in an effort to provide a framework for the vendors to implement quality of service (QoS) guarantees. These two classes--Guaranteed Service and Controlled Load--do not adequately support the end-to-end quality of service requirements that the Navy has for command-and-control and mission-critical applications under stringent battle conditions. Fundamentally, these two Intserv QoS classes do not take advantages of the statistical nature of communication traffic. We propose to develop a coherent set of statistical QoS criteria (delay, jitter and loss) that will work within the Intserv QoS framework and will enhance the Intserv traffic management capabilities. Our goal is to develop an end-to-end QoS Optimzation (IP QO) tool that will allow Navy network managers to set router and switch parameters to achieve maximum possible network bandwidth utilization, end-to-end, in a heterogeneous network environment. The proposed IP QO tool will work with HP OpenView and IBM's Trivoli, the Navy's Network Management System's of choice. Through these NMSs, it will allow network managers to control and configure the shipboard networks to guarantee end-to-end QoS services.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  The use of sled vehicles to perform high speed/high acceleration testing of warheads and warhead components generates an inherently Noisy vibration environment. The anticipated level of shocks and the vibration energy levels associated with sled tracks will normally exceed the environment of a missile in free flight. This elevated shock and vibration environment inhibits the accurate testing of actual hardware and necessitates either hardening the hardware to the sled track vibration levels or designing new hardware for testing only.  Physitron proposes a solution to this problem with a low cost, technically innovative approach which is based on a unique understanding of the problem, an ability to treat the entire track, sled, and payload as a connected system and the capability to turn the analytical solution into hardware which will solve this problem of reducing the shock and vibration levels in dynamic warhead testing to acceptable, near actual flight levels. Each of the contributing parts will be designed to produce a system which meets the SBIR objectives. The design and fabrication process, the track, the track status, the maintenance of track status, the track-sled interface, quality control of the interface, the structure of the sled, and the payload isolation system will all be optimized to achieve the required cost/benefit results.

Previous work in this area concentrated on either data or voice commu-nications, without an attempt to integrate the different traffic types. Multimedia communications is a central mode of operation for many of today's applications, both for military and commercial markets. For instance, projects such as Global Awareness or Digitized Battlefield require many different and differing traffic streams to be conveyed over the same tactical network. These different traffic streams are characterized by different requirements, such as delay, jitter, bit error rate, outage probability, etc. Quality-of-Service (QoS) metrics attached to different traffic types, and effective methods for utilizing these metrics in routing and multimedia algorithms, do not yet provide adequate solutions to these problems. This proposal addresses exactly this issue - provision of QoS in the ad-hoc communication environment to support multimedia traffic. In particular, we will study: 1) QoS needs and requirements for DoD's tactical applications, 2) previously proposed and implemented schemes to support QoS in both fixed and wireless networks, 3) incorporation of QoS parameters into ad-hoc networks, 4) effective link-sensing techniques for QoS-based routing, and 5) how Alternate Path Routing can be employed within ad-hoc networks.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  Rechargeable Battery Corporation has developed innovative bismuth modified manganese dioxide (BMMD) materials with unique electro- active properties. These BMMD materials could significantly enhance the performance of rechargeable lithium batteries, and are already the basis of an advanced Secondary Zinc Alkaline Manganese Dioxide (SZAMTM) battery technology. In the alkaline system the bismuth dopant confers deep (2-electron), reversible, cyclability to the MnO2. By complexing with soluble Mn(III) species, the bismuth serves as a redox catalyst, increasing the working voltage of the cell. Steric effects of the Bi-Mn complexes appear to prevent the formation of non-rechargeable MnO2 phases so that capacity fade in practical cells is low; 500 cycles are readily achieved. There is now direct evidence that BMMD materials can produce similar effects in rechargeable lithium systems, potentially translating into capacities of more than 500 Ah/kg and cell voltages of 3- 4+ Volts, if the same level of benefit can be achieved. Solution-phase structural stabilization constitutes an entirely new approach toward the development of manganese oxides for rechargeable lithium batteries. In this Phase I SBIR development program, various structural forms of BMMD will be incorporated into the cathode of button cells with lithium anodes and evaluated for specific capacity, cyclability and fade. Micro-structural analysis will be carried out on the material before and after cycling.",

Human tolerance to whole-body and body segment accelerations are compared to mineblast accelerations to assess their injury potential and to define the operational envelope of a mineblast energy attenuation system. Candidate energy absorber designs are described using static and dynamic analysis methods and advanced seat design tools. A static and dynamic test plan that verifies the function of the AAAV mineblast seat energy attenuation system is outlined. Preliminary designs for the seat structure, energy attenuator, occupant restraint system, and cushion system are presented along with a system weight budget and supporting static and dynamic analyses.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  Combat systems have historically been developed through a process that focuses on insular subsystems. This process has resulted in severe limitations on system interoperability and technical obsolescence. In addition, excessive life cycle costs are associated with maintaining multiple configurations to ensure some level of interoperability. To overcome these limitations, new emphasis has been placed on the use of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) technologies. To support the use of COTS, DSR has developed a real-time middleware framework for integrated combat systems and joint warfare coordination systems that is becoming widely used in the Navy. Transportable Middleware (TM) permits software developers to take advantage of the continuing technology advances in the commercial computing industry, because application software can be ported quickly. TM is being applied to the Cooperative Engagement Capability Processor (CEP) because of the desire to use a common software baseline on many different hosts located on different platforms. The overall objective of this Phase I research is to extend TM by designing a suite of test and performance analysis tools that will minimize the need for complete regression testing when introducing new hardware and software. The ultimate goal is minimizing life-cycle cost, which is particularly crucial to the CEC Program.",

We have past experience in this technology in the IR decoy technology development area, and are well equipped to fabricate and test structures in Phase 1. The study will consist of three (3) segments. 1), an analytical study that includes mathematical modeling, a limited systems analysis and literature search. 2), a thermal management system design effort that will consider applications/configurations in space vehicles, and 3) fabrication of a prototype thermal transport device, and a test series to verify performance.

        "abstract": "Not Available  Large scale integrated systems are often plagued by sneak conditions because they are comprised of several different components that are designed independently by different groups. Design reuse, cross-pollination of requirements, insufficient system component modeling, continual requirements changes and inherent design process weaknesses make sneak paths more likely to occur and more difficult to detect in these complex systems. Software sneak paths in particular are typically not caught by evaluation or test, resulting in operational errors and outright failures in fielded systems. Sneak Circuit Analysis (SCA) is a proven process that eliminates unwanted paths in electronic systems and has been successfully applied to Software Sneak Path Analysis (SSPA). STi proposes to study present design process and available case reports of integrated combat and warfare systems to identify root causes of software sneak paths. Based on our research, coupled with our extensive SCA experience, we will: (1) recommend changes to design procedures and processes; (2) determine whether analysis techniques can be developed around existing models; (3) identify minimum system modeling requirements; and (4) define requirements for software tools to be developed and tested in Phase II that have potential to eliminate the hidden effects and enable designers to focus on performance.",

Otherwise, it\u00bfs properties are similar to fibers-the WGA is mechanically flexible, compact, light weight, efficient, cost-effective, in meter-class lengths.  Additional exceptional properties include: preservation of spatial coherence, beam quality, and polarizaton; a geometry amenable to being pumped by high power laser diode arrays with minimal coupling optics; large surface area for reduced thermal loading; and potentially scalable to kilowatts of cw power or tens of millijoules pulsed output.  A Nd- or Yb-doped WGA pumped by laser-diode arrays is proposed that will result in high power output in the most efficient and compact design.  A completely passive-conduction-cooled system is possible by utilizing CTI\u00bfs  hot laser diode  technology.  The WGA is ideal for space-based and technical airborne lasers where resources are at a premium.

        "abstract": "Not Available  Current Intercommunications System (ICS) designs utilize lengthy and cumbersome cords to attach a crewman's headset to a distributed audio (intercom) system. These cords require constant attention thereby reducing mission effectiveness while increasing the potential for accident or injury. Replacing the communications cord with a covert radio frequency (RF) link will improve operational effectiveness without subjecting the aircraft to interception by electronic warfare threats. Under Phase I, Multispectral Solutions, Inc. (MSSI) will develop a novel ultra wideband RF ICS link. The link will be compatible with existing headsets and intercom control boxes. The UWB wireless ICS will permit unimpeded movement throughout the cabin and to a limited distance outside of the aircraft. Key advantages of MSSI's UWB approach include the use of a very low probability of intercept and detection (LPI/D) waveform, multipath immunity, low power consumption, small size and low cost. Under Phase II, several prototype UWB WICS will be developed for use in testing onboard selected aircraft. The size of the modules will be significantly reduced and voice encryption will be added to further improve performance against intercept threats. Phase II will reduce technical risks thereby establishing a strong basis for Phase III follow-on efforts.",

WiTech has been actively developing GaN based materials technology for microwave power HEMTs.  A transferred substrate HBT technology that minimizes the parasitic base-collector capacitance thereby resulting in very high fmax (> 400 GHz) transistors, has been demonstrated at UCSB. The ability to merge the aforementioned high performance technologies would lend WiTech a key advantage in developing GaN based transferred substrate HBTs.   GaN based transferred substrate HBTs would enable an extremely low parasitic HBT technology capable of operating at very high power levels at microwave frequencies. A necessary feature of the transferred substrate technology is the presence of an etchable substrate.  In order to facilitate this, WiTech proposes to develop the AlGaN/GaN based HBT structure on Silicon substrates.  In the phase I contract, WiTech will investigate growth of GaN on Silicon and address the fabrication of the HBT base-emitter junction.  The full-scale development of the HBT and circuit applications will be part of a Phase II effort.   Transferred substrate AlGaN-GaN HBTs on Si substrates would combine the advantages of a low parasitic-high performance HBT technology, high power operation realizable from GaN based materials and the economies of scales",

Our novel approach to these requirements involves optical heterodyne between two diode laser-pumped, electro-optically tuned, single frequency microlasers operating at 1.55 \u00bfm.  In such a device, the output frequency is tuned simply by applying a voltage to the laser Phase noise control is facilitated as well as phase locking.  This is in contrast to slower frequency control techniques that use piezoelectric or temperature control.   The anticipated performance of monolithic devices yields an optical source with extremely low phase noise, making the ideal for microwave synthesis.  Microlaser technology combines this potential with compactness and low cost and represents a substantial improvement over current state-of-the-art non-planar lasers.

Nitride based wide bandgap semiconductors have demonstrated microwave power densities substantially higher than conventional structures such as GaAs MESFETs and HEMTs. The AlGaN-GaN HEMT is the most attractive since high voltage, high current and low on-resistance can be simultaneously achieved, resulting in high power-high efficiency operation.  Loss in large signal rf performance, both in power and PAE is one of the most important problem in current state of the art AlGaN-GaN HEMTs. In this program, WiTech proposes to address this problem by developing the Silicon Nitride insulating Gate HEMTs (SiNG-HEMT) in the AlGaN-GaN material system. As explained in the proposal, the SiN insulator will alleviate the trapping effect in AlGaN-GaN HEMTs. This will enable the GaN HEMT technology that achieves power densities ~ 10 times and power added efficiencies higher than existing GaAs MESFET and pHEMT microwave technologies.  In phase I, WiTech shall fabricate 0.6 um gate length SiNG-HEMTs operating at a high power density (~ 3-5 W/mm), high efficiency  (> 40 %) at C band.  The SiNG-HEMT will be compared to a baseline AlGaN-GaN HEMT to quantify the effect of the SiN insulating gate on the device performance. Phase II goals would be to target higher power densities (~ 5-7 W/mm) as well as higher efficiencies (~ 60-70 %), demonstration of enhancement mode SiNG-HEMTs and increased reliability.",

The proposed research will produce a conceptual telescience system design suitable for the remotely-supervised semi-autonomous operation of a portable data collection radar. This radar data collection concept will reduce the costs of acquiring measured signature data by eliminating the ned to bring the aircraft to a stationary measurement radar, by reducing the need for dedicated aircraft assets, and by eliminating the need for on-site radar operator personnel. At the same time, it will enhance the utility of the radar measurement system by allowing remote observers to view the radar data as it is collected and by allowing remote experimenters to use these data in real time. A demonstration plan will be produced which will show how this concept can be demonstrated using an existing data collection radar.",

The overall technical objective of this program is sto develop a high-power cw-like source in the mid-infrared with emphasis on the range 4.5-5 microns.  The system will be based on converted diode-pumped solid-state laser.  The approach is to increase the conversion in an absorption length of the nonlinear material so that significant conversion is obtained even in the region of strong absorption.  We will use a mode-locked laser to have high pump intensity, and quasi-phasematching to have high nonlinerity.  Our pump laser will be a passively mode-locked Nd:YAG laser at 1 micron for robustness and manufacturability.  The frequency converter will be a synchronously pumped OPO.  Our baseline material will be PPLN, but we will also use other periodically poled ferroelectrics, notabley periodically poled MgO-doped LiNbO3.",

This heat of solution characteristic, combined with the latent heat of vaporization, significantly increases the cooling capacity of the working fluid, resulting in significantly lower flow rates required for a given cooling load, decreasing the pumping power required.

        "abstract": "Not Available  New advances in electric motor technology coupled with dramatic reductions in life-cycle costs and weight have driven aircraft designers to incorporate new electric-powered actuation devices into their near-term designs. The failure of these electromechanical actuator (EMA) components is expected, but difficult to predict. Worst-case EMA failures can have tragic results, so detecting failure before it occurs is highly desirable. By analyzing both electrical modes, plus performance parameters of an operating EMA, one can determine the extent of degradation without adding additional sensors or requiring dismantling the EMA and performing a detailed inspection of its components. This  condition-based  maintenance will result in large cost savings by extending the useful life of mechanical components, extending normal maintenance cycles, and safeguarding against premature component failure. ORINCON proposes to develop a prognostic algorithm development system for automated detection and prediction of faults in an operating EMA. Our EMA Health Diagnostic (EHD) toolkit system uses advanced spectral estimation techniques, model-based condition algorithms, data fusion, and neural network processing to detect mechanical flaws and predict failures. The proposed system will enable advanced prognostic algorithm development based on operational EMA data using ORINCON's advanced spectral estimation techniques, neural net processing, and multisensor fusion.",

Designers want to digitize the signal as close to the front end as possible. This is driving the development of 100 GHz or greater IC technology for A/D converters, synthesizers, MUX/DEMUXs, DDSs, and PRNs. At microwave frequencies, InP HEMT devices have demonstrated the best combination of gain, noise figure, and linearity. But the InP substrate is very expensive. The price of a raw 3-inch InP substrate(~$800) is comparable to the cost of a 4-inch GaAs PHEMT wafer. When considering the mature GaAs MESFET and PHEMT technology with 4 inch fab lines, retaining GaAs substrate in manufacturing operation, as opposed to switching to InP substrates, is highly desirable.  ELI proposes a next generation  TlGaAs based PHEMT on GaAs substrates. TlGaAs on GaAs PHEMT will offer many  advantages over present technologies. These include Improved performance with reduced cost, better reliability, and lower leakage currents. In phase I, MBE growth of TlGaAs will be carried out, and prototype PHEMT device will be realized in phase II.",

Greater re-use of TPS and freedom to insert new devices in ATS.  Broader base for asset supplies to amortize driver costs due to greater asset interoperability among different suppliers.

The existing methodology uses the computer program FOCAL-P that has worked satisfactorily with regards to accuracy of predictions. However, the speed of computations in FOCAL-P is an order of magnitude too slow for the Navy's needs. This proposal outlines three tasks that specifically address the need for a near real-time algorithm to predict the cable behavior during installation. The first is to study the computational efficiency of FOCAL-P. Understanding the computational bottlenecks in the present code is essential to making improvements. The second task involves a novel approach to predicting the micro-cable response in the marine environment. This approach applies numerical algorithms, such as choice of coordinate systems, coordinate transformations and equations of motion solutions that have been successfully used in the prediction of aircraft and missile trajectories to the current problem. The last task involves real-time graphical visualization of the cable as it is being installed on the seafloor. This last task is the precursor to closed-loop control of the cable laying process.",

In this Phase I program, Orbital Research Inc., will evaluate the feasibility of an active, self-clearing MEMS (Microelectromechanical Systems) suction device for flow control on an airfoil.  The proposed micro-valve will be a MEMS device that is electrostatically operated (low power) and capable of regulating the required suction.  The micro-valve will actuate a novel suction flow control technique, which exploits the natural instability in separated flow to trigger intense vortices on the airfoil surface.  Since part of the control input is supplied by the flow itself, the required suction level is reduced.  Results from preliminary experiments indicate a potential two-order magnitude reduction in suction rate from conventional techniques.  This program will design, fabricate and test this innovative, self-clearing MEMS micro-valve.  Then, the active separation control system will demonstrate, and validate discrete suction under simulated rapid maneuvers as the airfoil is quickly moved through increasing angles of attack in the wind tunnel.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  Head-mounted displays (HMDs) play a vital role in military and commercial simulation and training systems. They allow the user to interact with and navigate through virtual worlds before encountering them for real. This has proven to save lives and increase effectiveness in military applications such as flight simulation, dismounted infantry simulation, hazardous materials handling, mission planning and rehearsal. Immersive HMDs also have valuable commercial applications in education, architecture, medicine, entertainment, virtual prototyping, teleconferencing, scientific and financial data visualization and web-based experiences. All of the previously existing motion-tracking technologies (magnetic, acoustic, optical, mechanical, gravimetric) have significant problems with jitter, latency, interference, line-of-sight, accuracy, and/or range. These deficiencies lead to simulator sickness which can erase all the benefits of the immersive application. In addition to HMDs, many other applications (i.e. weapon aiming, camera tracking, personal navigation, etc.), require improved tracking technology as well. InterSense has patented, developed, and successfully commercialized the world's first inertial and sensor-fusion-based motion tracking systems. This technology offers very low jitter and latency, large range, immunity to environmental interference, and high-quality motion prediction to combat latency in the computer graphics rendering system. In this Phase 1 SBIR, we propose to research the technologies for a new generation of micro-miniature integrated inertial measurement units, and appropriate calibration and sensor fusion algorithms. Capitalizing on recent advances in micro-machining technology, sensor fusion algorithms, and electronic packaging, the new InertiaCube\u00bf will offer substantially improved performance, smaller size, and lower manufacturing cost.",

In particular, in Phase I we will carry out the following tasks: (i) Problem formulation and acquisition of linearized F/A-18 models and flight test data for flutter identification; (ii) Apply Deterministic Stochastic Realization Algorithm (DSRA) and Global Maximum Likelihood Estimation (GMLE) algorithms to flight data of F/A-18 aircraft; (iii) Determine the sensitivity of the system to different failures; (iv) Quantify the available control input redundancy in terms of the control authority required to accommodate different failures; (v) Design integrated HM-FDI and ARC algorithms; (vi) Test, tune and evaluate the performance obtained using the SI, HM-FDI, and ARC algorithms for the F/A-18 aircraft models and data; (vii) Develop a conceptual design for the SI, HM-FDI and ARC software toolbox that can be readily integrated into the IDEAS and MATLAB environments. In Phase II we will extend our approach to a larger set of failures and structural damage, to nonlinear F/A-18 models, and complete the development and delivery of the toolbox in IDEAS and MATLAB environments.

Under this proposal, the existing slot spiral design will be integrated via our innovative approach with various loading options and matched terminations to develop a rugged, low cost, conformal antenna that will be about 13 inches in diameter and 0.875 inches deep for operation above 100MHz.  For operating frequencies down to 30 MHz, the proposed antenna's size can be kept less than 20 inches in diameter and 1.5 inches deep, a size that can be readily incorporated into the skin of a UAV at various locations.  Further size reduction can be achieved by extending the proposed concepts, if necessary.  Because of the possibility to attain extremely large bandwidths (i.e. 30 MHz to 5 GHz) based on our proposed innovative extensions, the proposed antenna is a  dream antenna  for ultimate counter-intelligence/ECM applications and for very accurate direction finding, imaging at varying depths (within foliage) or obtaining moving target information.",

Two specific examples of immediate importance are 940 nm Nd lasers for water vapor lidar, and high energy 1.03um Yb lasers.  These lasers require optics with high reflection associated with antireflection less than 70 nm apart.  Such optics are extremely difficult to fabricate with existing thin films coating technology.  This SBIR project is aimed at addressing these limitations by developing optics based on distributed Bragg reflectors (DBR) in bulk optical materials.  The production of DBR optics will be accomplished by incorporating periodic refractive index gratings in optical quality crystals by an innovative process developed in part through previous NASA SBIR projects aimed at producing ultra-high perfection materials for laser gain media.  By precisely controlling growth parameters, compositional variations can be incorporated in crystalline materials.  These compositional variations result in an associated refractive index grating that can form a DBR.  Optics based on this technology would be tunable and have high damage thresholds.  This project will demonstrate the capability of systematically producing periodic refractive index variations index in bulk materials and characterize their applicability as optical components.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  The primary goal of this Phase I SBIR program is to develop cost effective, high performance 1300nm vertical-cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs).  These devices can serve as a low cost replacement for edge emitting, or stripe lasers, which are commonly used in military and commercial telecommunications networks.  Successful VCSEL devices have been fabricated in the shorter infrared wavelength range (850 and 980 nm); however, operation at longer wavelength from 1.3 \u00bf 1.5\u00bfm faces many technological challenges.  The proposed VCSEL structure and fabrication process will provide single element and multielement devices which will be suitable for low cost, high volume production.  In addition, an active layer design will be incorporated that will allow for better temperature stability for long-wavelength VCSELs.    The program technology can be used in military systems for applications such as radar; RF photonics; and battle management, command, control, and communications (BMC3).  The 1300nm VCSELs will also facilitate the development of low cost, reliable transmitters for system applications which include local area networks (LANs), wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) and cable television (CATV)",

Mode-1 provides a typical broad-coverage FRPA pattern for situations when no jamming is present. Mode-2 and Mode-3 provide two anti-jam patterns. Mose-2 provides a steerable null in azimuth with potentially greater than 25 dB J/S. Mode -3 provides enhanced elevation pattern rolloff at all azimuth angles, for situations when a large number of jammers are present at many different azimuth angels. The antenna electronics required to produce these modes is simple and inexpensive. Passive pattern control technologies are also offered to provide additional anti-jam performance.

        "abstract": "Not Available  Piezoceramics have been gaining increasing popularity in structural control.  Their high energy density permits fabrication of actuators with very high control authority, yet relatively little mass of volume.  These properties make piezoceramics ideal for precision positioning elements (e.g., stabilization of optical gun sights), structural damping, precision controlled valves (e.g., environmental control systems) and noise control (e.g. vehicle interior quieting). Unfortunately, piezoceramics have some undesirable properties which complicate their use.  In common usage, the devices are bonded to the surface of the structure and actuated using d31coupling.  This yields a device which cannot control torsional or twist modes of orthotropic structures, limiting the usefulness of piezoceramics in applications in which torsional motion is important, including missile bodies or fins, and the torsional vibration of satellite solar panels. Herein, ACX proposes to address this problem by developing a surface mount piezoceramics actuator for torsional control.  Target applications will be selected which have military and commercial significance.  Devices will be designed, built and tested to demonstrate their ability to meet the functional requirements of the target applications.  Performance prediction tools will be developed for design purposes.",

The PALS system must be at least functionally equivalent to ACLS+ and must meet the signature requirements of stealth CVX. The new DoD JPALS system, based on FAA LDGPS architecture, meets all the CVX requirements, however the vulnerability of GPS satellites signal- in-space to enemy jamming in battlespace environment presents a major concern. This proposal addresses this concern directly and proposes two levels of augmentation to JPALS: (1) an anti-jam augmentation to mitigate degradation in the receiver signal-to- noise power due to jamming and (2) a robust overlay signal architecture augmentation to address satellite's signal denial in worst case jamming. The Augmented JPALS, AJPALS, will be analyzed in Phase I through modeling and simulation and using experimental hardware measurements to validate the feasibility of AJPALS architecture. The Phase I program will also investigate the effects of these two levels of augmentation to JPALS in meeting the guidance requirements for shipboard CAT II landing. The Phase II program will implement and demonstrate the AJPALS architecture and will develop design-to-cost goals for this product in the context of both military and commercial viability.",

The use of high performance carbon coatings that are hard, chemically inert and possess a low coefficient of friction has been proposed as the alternative. An innovative and economical process to produce this coating is also proposed. The coating is gray black in color and has intrinsic lubricity and exceptional wear and corrosion resistance properties and is galvanically neutral. While the coated surface is an excellent retainer of oil films, the surface will continue to perform very reliably even without the application of oil films. The low process temperature assures that the metallurgical properties and dimensional tolerances of the base material are retained.  There are no effluents from the process and it is 100% environmentally clean. The process is simple and is expected to be highly scalable and economical.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  The sophisticated new designs of multi-layer composites currently used in naval technology present a challenging problem of detecting integrity-reducing anomalies to assure safe and reliable operation. Microwave techniques are useful for NDT of these composites due to their penetrating power and sensitivity to changes associated with boundary conditions. However, microwave bending and surface polarization make it difficult to localize the detected defects. Conventional techniques such as ultrasound and infrared imaging do not provide the necessary resolution. Thus, a reliable technique to address this problem must be developed. Recent advances in 3-D x-ray imaging modalities have created excellent potential to successfully address this demanding application. The capabilities of these powerful instruments, however, are presently limited by the x-ray sensors available, which offer a tradeoff between the efficiency and the image resolution and limit the speed of operation. We propose to develop a novel x-ray imaging detector based on a new transparent optical ceramic scintillator to address these needs. The scintillator will be micro-pixelized to provide high detection efficiency without degrading the image quality. The scintillator will be integrated into a fast digital readout to form detector that will allow the full potential of advanced 3-D imaging modalities be realized.",

The project will result in a low volume, low cost production system which employs advanced techniques (stereolithography, fused deposition modeling, layered object manufacturing, etc.) to rapidly make custom air handlers. The proposed air handler employs a sliding vane compressor (before fuel cell) coupled to a sliding vane expander (after fuel cell) thus providing very efficient, noiseless operation. A concept compressor/expander was sized for a 100-Watt power supply. The concept design provides .2 SCFM of air at a pressure ratio of 3.0 and only consumes 7.8 Watts while occupying 2 cubic inches of volume. A system analysis showed that the hydrogen storage tank comprised - 70% of total system weight (based on a 10 hour mission). Thus, compressor and fuel cell efficiencies play a critical role in keeping system weight down. The analysis showed system weight is minimized at a pressure ratio of ~3.0 (since higher pressure boosts fuel cell efficiency) and that the proposed expander reduced system weight by 15% (by reducing required compressor power). The concept minimizes noise by matching (with adjustments for losses) compressor and expander pressure ratios and massflows, thus eliminating sudden expansions that produce noise.

This limits their use for reducing RCS and EMI on military vehicles. Fortunately, for RCS problems the areas needing treatment are localized, and for EMI problems the on-board sensor locations are known ahead of time. This enables significant optimization of the absorber to minimize cost and size. A new absorber is proposed that uses this fact to full advantage. It is proposed that a very thin layer of metallization, containing a pattern of small resistively loaded elements, be added to an existing thin iron-loaded rubber type of absorber. The advantages of adding this layer are threefold. First, the orientation and loading of the elements provide the anisotropy needed for absorption of arbitrarily polarized waves. Second, since the absorption takes place in a very thin layer instead of over a volume, it is inherently lightweight. Third, the pattern can be optimized and fabricated using low-cost printed circuit board techniques. The type of absorber proposed is sufficiently pliable to be easily cut and wrapped to cover the surface where needed on military and commercial vehicles.",

NASWT requirements for enhanced accuracy, longer range, and higher delivered energy on target demand higher energy, higher temperature propellants and new projectile designs. These requirements accelerate gun barrel and missile launch tube wear and, in some cases, preclude the implementation of new propellants or projectiles. Alternatives have been proposed to inhibit wear. Potentially the simplest, most cost-effective such alternative is the addition of wear- and corrosion-resistant refractory metal bore surface treatments to existing barrels and tubes. The success of this approach has been limited to date due to high barrel length-to-diameter (L/D) ratios and related limitations of current processes for fabricating refractory metal liners within high L/D bores. These limitations are especially great for rifled barrels. To overcome these limitations, Ultramet proposes to use an innovative new low temperature chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process to apply refractory metals directly within conventional gun steel barrels without degrading or distorting the steel jacket.

During this time, damage to property while severe was local, and casualties usually ran in the 10s to 100s.  Unfortunately, it has entered a qualitatively new regime in the last decade; now, the effects of a single act can be global.  Indications for the future are even more serious.  The capabilities developed over the last few decades to address terrorism are biased toward response/pursuit.  This bias is inadequate and dangerous, given that the potential consequences are now so serious.  A new, preemptive capability that augments existing ones is required.  We need a technology to support a quantum advance in our understanding of terrorist behavior - both individual and social/organizational.  Such a technology, by rigorously treating the psychological (e.g., personality) and social structure (e.g., organization, ideology, culture) of terrorists and their organizations, enables us to understand how they see the world, predict what they are disposed to do, assess our weaknesses, and identify their vulnerabilities.

LF-ATG and Triton have applied the LENS solid freeform (SFF) method to generate titanium matrix composites (Ref. 4).  We anticipate adapting LENS to provide a more diverse range of materials and periodic geometries in the design, fabrication and test of composite devices that are opaque to mechanical vibrations over a significantrange of frequencies.  As shown in this proposal, our approach can achieve precise tailoring of the spatial distribution of the scattering / phase shifting materials in millimeter to tens of centimeter-scale structures.

Unfortunately, rhenium has three  drawbacks, consisting of high cost, poor fabricability, and high density/weight.   The proposed program will utilize commercially developed cermet technology to produce  rhenium structures having high erosion and thermal resistance with a >50% reduction in  cost and weight.  Specifically, the proposed program will demonstrate the application of  rhenium coatings to ceramic and metallic particles, which will then be fabricated into tailorable  components using press and sinter or powder forging techniques.  The resultant structure will consist  of a continuous network of rhenium as the minor phase (roughly 30 v%), reinforced with a discreet  distribution of ceramic or lower cost metallic phase.  This technology is currently used for abrasives,  syntactic foam, composite, and cutting tool manufacture.  The proposed program would fabricate, characterize,  and test in a subscale rocket engine, a series of rhenium cermets having a distribution of thermal conductivities  and heat capacities, enabling the tailoring of rocket and gun components for naval applications.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  The objective of this Small business Innovation Research Phase I project is to devise accurate techniques for predicting turbulent mixing with a view toward estimating the effectiveness of strategies for neutralizing bio/chem hazards.  Recent, substantial progress by Krispin Technologies, Inc., in developing 3D vortex methods for turbulent flow simulation as part of a DOE supported SBIR Phase II project will be leveraged to yield immediate application to realistic hazard scenarios of interest to DTRA.  Among these are scalar plumes emanating from multiple sites within confined or open air domains.  The unique capabilities of vortex methods derive from the versatility of their grid-free character; their computational speed; and, their capacity to represent essential physical properties of turbulent flow.  In particular, they are better positioned to model the essential effect of small scale vortices on scalar mixing than traditional grid-based closure and large eddy simulation techniques relying on unphysical diffusive models.  The accuracy of the proposed methodology will be tested for scalar plumes in atmospheric flows under a variety of conditions as well as for turbulent jets.  Subsequently, methods for quantifying mixing between species will be devised and then applied to problems for which scalars originate from separate sources.  The proposed new technology is important to DTRA interests and is applicable to a broad range of DTRA and defense applications.  It can be readily adapted for civilian use; it can be utilized for better analysis and control of numerous industrial activities, ranging from chemical to energy applications, natural and industrial pollution, and other health hazards.",

While existing M&S tools can presently model complex scenarios, multiple sensors and targets, accurate sensor motion, and targets with articulation, they do not necessarily incorporate high fidelity, accurate, wideband monostatic and bistatic signatures in the RF, IR, and spectral regions. Our plan includes the use, extension, and fixing of signature modeling approaches that have been developed, but whose performance levels need improvement. Our emphasis is on accuracy of the signature data, with particular attention to data compression techniques for monostatic and bistatic data sets. The entire approach pivots on the interplay of target tack information, which can be correlated to dynamic articulation (position of control surfaces, vector thrust geometry, etc.) to produce -via model-based methods - highly accurate time-varying signature data. This plan paves the way for a new set of tools that allow accurate, detailed modeling of targeting issues for space-based sensors, directly address data fusion, allow optimization of intelligence collection scenarios, provide cost reduction by replacing most testing with credible M&S, and provide EW effectiveness assessments.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  The threat of proliferation of chemical and biological weapons has increased alarmingly in recent years.  Treaty monitoring and verification activities require the rapid collection and chemical analysis of samples at suspected chemical warfare (CW) agent-producing facilities.  Current on-site analysis procedures are slow, thus hindering the effectiveness of verification operations.  Sensor devices for both accurate prescreening of collected samples for the presence of signature chemicals associated with CW agents, and for selectively pinpointing areas to be sampled, are needed.  Such sensors should be inexpensive, have low logistics burden, and use very little power.  Sensitive, specific detection of signature compounds under these demanding conditions requires a novel approach.  Physical Sciences, Inc. proposes to develop a small, inexpensive, and rugged microsensor device for chemical warfare agents and associated signature chemicals which can actively sample an environment and selectively indicate the identity and quantity of these species.  These signature compounds include live G, V, and H agents, agent precursors (used in agent production) such as dichlor and difluor, and agent decomposition products such as the phosphonic acids.  In Phase I a prototype microsensor wil be demonstrated and a preliminary design of the Phase II device will be completed. The proposed microsensor will provide a significant improvement in the detection of signature chemicals associated with chemical warfare agents, and thus will enhance the protection of the civilian and military population. The underlying technology is versatile and can be readily adapted to specific detection of commercially important species including pesticides, environmental pollutants, biomolecules, and odorants.  Dual use will be particularly applicable for the chemical medical, agricultural, food, and fragrance industries.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  The objective of this effort is to determine the feasibility of designing, fabricating and testing a sensor cooler which uses solid materials as the refrigerant. These materials demonstrate the unique property known as the magnetocaloric effect, which means that they increase and decrease in temperature when magnetized/demagnetized. This effect has been observed for many years and was used for cooling near absolute zero. Recently, materials are being developed which have sufficient temperature and entropy change to make them useful for a wide range of temperature applications. The proposed effort includes magnetocaloric effect material selection, analyses, design and integration of components into a preliminary design. Benefits of this design are lower cost, longer life, lower weight and higher efficiency because it only requires one moving part - the rotating disk on which the magneto caloric material is mounted. The unit uses no gas compressor, no pumps, no working fluid, no valves, and no ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons/hydrochlorofluorocarbons (CFC's/HCFC's). Potential commercial applications include cooling of electronics, superconducting components used in telcommunications equipment (cell phone base stations), home and commercial refrigerators, heat pumps, air conditioning for homes, offices and automobiles, and virtually any place that refrigeration is needed.",

The dehydride design of the reactor uses a high temperature inert gas to remove hydrogen from chemical hydride forms of the titanium alloy feedstock. The material benefit of using the SSF process over powder metallurgy or laser rapid prototyping is the improved ballistic performance anticipated by spray forming Extra Low Interstitial (ELI) titanium alloy powders at low temperature in a non-oxidizing environment. It is anticipated that the strength of the material will be improved over high temperature processes by limiting the grain growth, while the ballistic performance is enhanced through in-situ dehydride treatment of titanium- alloy hydride powders. In Phase I. the object of the work will be directed toward investigating and demonstrating the feasibility of spray forming ELI titanium alloy components using the SSF technology in combination with the dehyride reactor. A target cost of S10 per lbm for the finished product is anticipated by using a recycling SSF system for gases and powders, along with low cost hydride form of the titanium alloy powder.

The diagnostic metrics strategy integrates state-of-the-art test-bed and in-service data with quantitative and statistical analysis techniques to provide impartial and accurate comparisons among different diagnostic algorithms. The developed diagnostic metrics will be calibrated and verified using gearbox seeded fault and accelerated failure data taken with the MDTB (Mechanical Diagnostic Test Bed) at the ARL at Penn State University. In addition, performance degradation diagnostic data from a F100 accelerated mission test will be used to develop and verify metrics for diagnosing degraded condition performance. Finally, the proposed metrics will be tested on several different real-time, diagnostic technologies developed for the Navy by Impact Technologies and the ARL at Penn State, utilizing neural networks (supervised and unsupervised), wavelets, fuzzy logic systems, and probabilistic diagnostic methods.",

Such a vehicle must be very low mass, with a high power output for electric propulsion. Conventional ion rockets or arcjets may not have the delta-V/mass ratio required for the mission. Star Technology and Research, Inc. proposes a concept of a maneuvering satellite that requires no expenditure of fuel for fulfilling Air Force orbital service missions. The mechanism to accomplish this is an advanced electrodynamic tether powered by lightweight solar panels to allow repeated orbital maneuvers without using propellant. Controlling the current flow in the tether allows complete control of the orbit. The vehicle could transport satellites from one orbit to another, and could service vehicles beyond low Earth orbit. In this Phase I investigation, the satellite concept is developed, its operational envelope is examined, and potential Air Force applications are evaluated. A proof-of-concept experiment is proposed for a low-cost space demonstration.",

Current tracking systems based on magnetic sensors are only useable at short range and tracking can be significantly affected by nearby metallic objects. The proposed approach to whole body tracking for immersive environments is to utilize modulated RF tags with an inertial sensor. The tags are placed on the object whose motion is to be tracked.  A stationary tracking receiver queries each tag by emitting a unique code.  The tag responds by transmitting a dual frequency ranging waveform modulated by the attitude as provided by a solid state gyro.  The phase difference between the two frequencies provides range which is processed to estimate tag position while demodulation provides attitude.  Data is made available to a workstation where synchronization of subject position with projected video takes place. With recent interest in RF ID tags, wireless products and solid state gyroscopes there is an abundance of low cost RF ICs and subsystems which can be used to construct a demonstration prototype with little risk",

STIL uses a fan beam laser illuminator, 1-D scanning or scannerless push broom imaging, and electrostatic sweep to generate high resolution 3-D images in a rugged compact configuration suitable for autonomous missile seeker applications. STIL is an ideal sensor for missile seeker automatic target acquisition/recognition in both the direct attack and wide area search scenarios.

Physical configuration (volume, weight, power) is well suited for the missile seeker platform. Arete proposes to directly demonstrate STIL's ability to achieve the necessary 3-D image resolution for missile seeker ATAIR applications by adapting and utilizing existing, proven hardware for a cost-effective Phase I concept validation.

Frequency hopping systems will be required to gain advantages of spread spectrum systems and minimize multi-user access interference. Channel dynamics increase with higher frequency operation and provide a significant obstacle to current receive processing techniques. Co-Channel interference, is emerging as one of the greatest impacts to digital data communications systems. A new approach to receiver design, applying Per Survivor Processing (PSP), offers the opportunity to achieve dramatic performance improvements (e.g. improved acquisition, and/or interference rejection) when a large number of users, difficult dynamics and/or large chanted uncertainties are present. Further, PSP excels when the channel characteristics, the number of interferers or reflections, and other key signal parameters are unknown. Application of PSP is now becoming feasible due to the rapidly increasing computational power and decreasing price of modern digital technology. PSP algorithms have been developed and simulated for dense urban environments wit mobile users under other efforts. The focus of this proposed Phase I work will be to develop an implementation capable of demonstrating the performance improvement of PSP applied to the mobile frequency hopped application.

        "abstract": "Not Available  Innovative filter designs can add capability and function to smart sensors while hardening the sensor against laser jamming and dazzle and the effects of nuclear radiation.  Depositing these filters directly on a focal plane array can reduce the sensor's size, customize the detector to a specific application, and allow for retrofitting the capability and function of the smart sensor without the need to modify the optical train.  Rugate optical interference filters provide high optical throughput while providing laser protection.  By using low Z, thermally matched materials, these filters offer radiation and x-ray survivability as well as laser protection.  The refractive index of rugate filters, continuously varied as a function of the film's optical thickness, is achieved by blending materials during deposition.  In addition to refractive index, other physical properties can be adjusted to mitigate the effects of ionizing radiation and thermal gradients.  For instance, a narrow bandpass coating can be applied to a focal plane array used in a scanning sensor.  The wavelength of the passband can be varied from pixel to pixel, giving the array spectral discrimination across the scanning axis.  This Phase I program will serve to develop a methodology for coating temperature-sensitive substrates.  Several filters, using selected materials, will be fabricated to demonstrate spectral performance, low temperature compatibility, and low defects and stress. Innovative rugate filters improve spectral performance, add capability, and harden sensors to laser and nuclear radiation.  In addition, depositing the filters directly on a focal plane array can reduce the sensor's size and customize the detector to specific applications.  Applications are many and varied, from threat hardening to hyperspectral sensors to thermal control.",

Consequently, medical workers and counter-terrorist response teams need to be able to rapidly detect and identify multiple infectious diseases/agents and biological threat organisms in real time in field settings. That important capability is not yet available. Because rapid detection and identification of disease organisms by culture is difficult, researchers have been working to develop molecular-based assays for detection and identification of pathogenic target organisms. However, the current laboratory-based DNA and antibody assay methods are not suitable for rapid, reliable real time testing in actual field settings. For this Phase I project, AndCare proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of producing a simple-to-operate, hand-held, battery-powered instrument capable of real time detection of pathogenic organisms using geneprobe techniques. The instrument will be designed to accommodate existing as well as next-generating assay technologies with the goal of providing the flexibility needed to meet the Army's needs for rapid, simultaneous detection of multiple organisms in a field setting.

The code also needs to be practical enough to be used as a designtool to assess passive or active fixes in a timely manner. In Phase I of this SBIR, the feasibility of a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) code that captures heat release/acoustic coupling will be demonstrated. Having previously shown the feasibility of capturng gaseous-fueled combustion instability, this Phase I effort will focus on liquid-fueld combustion instability analysis. Prediction will be compared to Pratt & Whitney single nozzle experiments that utilize the high shear fuel injector. In order to acount for the temporal variation of fuel spray, the liquid spray boundary conditions will be changed (i.e. drop velocity, SMD, etc.) based on local (temporal) airflow conditions. Also, a reduced chemical model will be developed and incorporated to describe the heat release of JP fuels. In Phase II, the LES methodology willbeimproved by incorporating Linear Eddy based subgrid models for chemical reaction and vaperization,and further validated. The LES code will then be applied to IHPTET III combustor configurations fromPratt & Whitneyand General Electric.",

Remote target detection, identification, and aimpoint selection for light weapons plays an important role in the engagement of hostile forces and dynamic entry, especially where the target views are restricted or low visibility conditions prevail (e.g. fires, obscurants, fog).  Devices that are compact and portable enough to meet some of these objectives exist.  However, they lack covert operation capability and their performance may be compromised by operation in total darkness or very low visibility scenarios.  Coherent Technologies, Inc. (CTI) proposes to develop an eyesafe precision targeting system operating near 4UM wavelength in the midwave-IR (MWIR) for weapons such as the M-4 and MP5.  The proposed device utilizes an all-solid state laser in a compact, battery \u00bfoperated configuration.  The selected wavelength penetrates dense obscurants and cannot be easily detected by opponents.  This lightweight device provides target ID and aimpoint selection with t he aid of a matching MWIR imaging camera.  In Phase I, CTI will design and demonstrate a MWIR laser source/imager for aimpoint selection.  In Phase II, a compact, rugged, gun-mounted unit will be developed.",

Our experience as responders to the Oklahoma City Bombing in 1995, and our involvement in the OKC Bombing Injury Study just completed, has provided us with an insight into the community of responders and their unique needs.  Our proposal will consist of a unique blend of commercial off the shelf software (COTS) and a common interface stripped of technical menus and verbiage.  The user will interface with Computer-Assisted Design (CAD) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) through a simple front end and common database.  This gives the user the flexibility to move from architectural detail to geographic information without duplicating common data.  Users will not only have standard symbol libraries and databases, but will also have the ability to add their own particular mission requirements.  Predictive analysis plug-ins will have the option of a graphical interface to CAD, GIS or both.  This approach will allow integration of different threat specific plug-ins to a common interface, thus reducing the learning curves and placing decision aids in the hands of true first responders. The benefits of this proposal are to empower Incident Commanders with traditional engineering knowledge in preplanning or the first critical hours of a disaster.

Alameda Applied Sciences Corporation proposes to use a train of 150 ps laser pulses to capture snap-shots of the density structures in an imploding z-pinch.  These snap-shots will reveal the structure of instabilities in the pinch and allow us to correlate improved power coupling to the pinch and higher radiation efficiency with mitigation of such instabilities.  The technique we propose to use is called Laser Shearing Interferometry.  LSI gives information on the sheath shape, stability and implosion velocity.  The Phase-I project will concentrate on just these measurements on Double-Eagle.  In Phase-II, the same hardware, with a few modifications, may be used to augment the sheath measurements to provide a detailed study of the implosion dynamics of the pinch.  The Phase-II instrument will thus be a more comprehensive tool for z-pinch development.  The Phase III effort will commercialize the instrument and supply models to DoD and DOE laboratories engaged in PRS research as well as modify the instrument for other commercial applications such as the combustion diagnostic tool. This program could improve the capabilities of existing and higher current simulators (Decade, Z and beyond) and provide design criteria for future simulators.  Commercial applications include non-invasive monitoring of fuel droplet-vapor mixing in combustion chambers including rocket engines and of x-ray lithography and microscopy system reproducibility and reliability.",

        "abstract": "In an era of declining budgets, techniques that promote faster, cheaper and better performance without compromising reliability or safety are the most sought after by the aircraft industry. The large costs associated with maintenance of gas turbines is a primary motivator for evaluating methods to detect problems before and during service with the intention of extending the overall life of these systems. Efficient cooling is also a mandatory requirement and the complex cooling designs of hot section components have become an even more critical function of the proper operation of the engine. Traditional NDT techniques are labor intensive, sometimes lack quantification, may not be able to represent problems in 3D and in many cases cannot properly test these new and/or complicated geometries. In this Phase I effort, we propose using an infrared system in conjunction with controlled stimulation sources along with integrated hardware and software to more accurately and cost effectively determine the quality of cooling circuits in these advanced cooled components. Hot section components can be tested for defects such as blocked cooling holes and passages, incompletely drilled holes, delamination of bonded components and thermal barrier coating bond integrity in a more effective manner using level 1 operators at tremendous cost savings. By comparing each component to a standard that has been previously determined to be acceptable/good, discrepancies can be identified and all test results compared and archived. With constructive improvements during Phase II, this system will provide an automated, cost effective inspection of modern and future gas turbine hot section components.",

Standard protocols provide a common ground for the equipment to communicate; however, the network performance is always lower than would be expected from its original network design. The causes of this performance degradation are subtle and can be traced, fundamentally, to a vendor's proprietary design schemes, e.g., packet scheduling, buffering, and call admission control, and inappropriate parameters setting on the network elements and their interfaces. We will investigate these root causes and their associated network design and operational difficulties. Our goal is to develop a Rules-based Expert System (RES) that will provide extensive 'expert experiences', known as knowledge rules, to assist designing and operating highly efficient heterogeneous networks. It will work with HP OPENVIEW or IBM TIVOLI, the Navy Network Management Systems of choice, so that RES can be remotely controlled and operated through a uniform Navy platform.

Within the last few years low cost ultra-high precision oscillators have become available, and these now make it possible to build UWB radar systems which have no base band frequency. The only signals transmitted are single pulses which can be generated by a single transistor which is either on or off. Impulses in the time domain generate very wide bandwidth signals in the frequency domain, and the signals generated by our current hardware have bandwidths in the several gigahertz range. UWB is able to penetrate foliage because of its low frequency components, which allows pulses to easily pass through foliage, or even walls, tree trunks, and concrete. In the system we propose, these pulses are generated in a pseudo-random sequence, making them virtually impossible to detect, and very difficult to jam. The energy from each pulse may be far below the noise level and is only detectable if you know exactly when to listen for the pulse, and can average many pulses together.  BENEFITS:  Our partner company, Time Domain Corporation (TDC), is the patent holder on much of the technology for UWB Time Modulated Impulse Radar and Impulse Communication. They have $15 million in private funds and have already begun marketing several products. IAI will work with TDC to commercialize the technology for a terrain preview sensor, and in several other niche areas.",

A high-level language is used to state the runtime monitoring conditions (event specifications) that might trigger key network management responses.  Our technology automatically compiles the event specification, dynamically distributing the necessary computations to detect those conditions automatically throughout a network.  The most significant results will include the design of a customized notation for network events distributed over arbitrary distributed networks and the dynamic specification of new monitoring conditions and responses - all scalable over the volume and diversity of events required to solve problems in a typical real-world network.  The ability for the network to monitor and correct itself dynamically forms the technology base for the next generation of self-adaptive networks.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes a unique controller system design based on the emerging reconfigurable computing technology (RCT) for phased away antenna control. RCT is the driving force behind a major paradigm shift in digital computing. The RCT approach enables rapid flexible design which is essential to dynamic diverse-phased array antenna applications. Because of the high degree of reconfigurability and other features such as low-cost, relatively high density, short time-to-market, in-field failure-free, etc., RCT has become the most popular system design tool for modern computer systems. Compared with ASIC, DSP, and commercial advanced single-chip controller design approaches, RCT offers a high degree of flexibility and expedites the work of the designers to rapidly and inexpensively implement advanced systems and verification of hardware/software integration. In this project, the main effort is to design and demonstrate a controller breadboard based on the RCT for implementing distributed beam steering algorithms. During Phase I, POC will design, fabricate, assemble and test a preliminary general purpose controller. In Phases II and III, POC will this model into a full prototype, and begin strategic relationships with future users for mass production and commercial distribution.",

Variants of this sensor could provide affordable environmental data acquisition for commercial and other Department of Defense applications. The technical objective is to formulate a design concept and demonstrate feasibility of an  A -size air-deployed expendable directional noise and reverberation sensor. This sensor will obtain real time, environmental data in shallow water to optimize the deployment and performance of acoustic sensors and systems. The sensor will be used to collect data for historical data bases and predeployment forecasting of future missions. The Navmar sensor will be capable of measuring the following parameters; directional ambient noise and reverberation, bottom depth and transmission loss for both monostatic and bistatic measurements in water depths to 1000 feet. From the above parameters, bottom loss and bottom backscatter can be calculated through the use of models. Sensor characteristics to be considered are dynamic range, source level, bandwidth and in-buoy processing.",

Improved hypocenter estimates and high-resolution velocity models are critical to the successful seismic monitoring of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.  During Phase I of the study we will demonstrate a nonlinear, multiple event location technique which uses both P and S arrival times and a pre-determined or hypothetical 3-D velocity model to estimate the hypocenters.  Travel times for the regional phases are calculated using a sophisticated eikonal finite-difference scheme, and the locations are determined using an efficient grid-search algorithm for 3-D media.  We propose to demonstrate its capabilities using synthetic data and a 3-D velocity model from a region of US monitoring concern.  We will also begin to develop the capacity to incorporate secondary phase arrival information as part of the location estimation procedure.  The methods proposed in this study can have immediate dual use application in both seismic monitoring and underground facility characterization.  The overall goal of the research is to develop a sophisticated set of commercial tools for improving hypocenter estimation using 3-D velocity models which could be used in multiple seismic applications.",

The methodology represents a quantum leap with respect to ongoing work on Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), and is based on the Backus Gilbert method for inversion.  This provides the framework for the implementation of a practical and scalable algorithm.  We recast the measurement of the similarity between query and document projections in principal component space as a constrained optimization problem.  The adoption of alternative optimization techniques brings a dramatic improvement in computational speed.  It also provides important conceptual advantages over the unsupervised classification process implied by LSI.

The ability to introduce constraints in the optimization translates into new and appealing IR functionality.  A new metric quantifies performance as a function of the order of relevance of the returned documents.  The prototype addresses issues pertaining to scalability, portability and extensibility.

        "abstract": "Not Available  This proposal describes a revolutionary new approach to circuit card testing that may virtually eliminate the need for automatic test equipment at the SRU level. This is accomplished through the use of a combination of molecular test equipment, nanoprobes, and electrochemical failure indicators. The molecular test equipment is fabricated and embedded within the individual integrated circuit in the chip substrate. Nanoprobes contain molecular test equipment that connect between the surface and the substrate of the integrated circuit at various functional areas. An electrochemical indicator placed on the surface of the chip receives signals from the molecular test equipment and nanoprobes, initiating a chemical reaction that provides a visual indication to a technician that the integrated circuit is faulty. Elimination of the requirements for automatic test equipment and their associated test program sets for SRU test may provide the Air Force, DOD, and industry in general with savings in the tens of billions of dollars in non-recurring and recurring costs. In addition, system readiness can be improved as a result of faster repair and turnaround times for equipment repair. Also, this technology can be adapted to provide a wide range of information regarding device operation, such as hours or operation, etc.",

The importance of urban combat to the US Army is growing. Urban combat requires individual combatants to work closely with members of their tactical team while in close proximity to innocent civilians, armed civilians, hostages, and enemy forces. While simulation-based training for urban combat has advanced rapidly in the past few years, there are still gaps in the technology. One deficiency is the limited capability of existing Computer Generated Forces (CGF). We propose to create Mission Planning and Training Tool MPTT), software for simulating urban combat scenarios using a new kind of CGF. Rather than rely on complex computer intelligence, MPTT produces CGF that use the intelligence of experienced training officers who act as scenario builders. These CGF can be directly pathed, and scripted to create scenarios involving human to human interaction at close quarters, including in and around buildings. MPTT will support scenario generation, interactive mission planning, rehearsal, and training. MPTT will be a powerful and practical tool for building urban combat training simulations.  BENEFITS:  MPTT is dual use technology, which will be commercialized by applying it to police training, fire fighting, disaster planning systems, etc.",

NEMI (National Electronics Manufacturing Initiative) projects that by 2001, 20% of the total resistors and capacitors needed will be integrated passives. The proposed program will therefore focus on developing widely applicable processes for incorporating passives into organic MCM-type packages. Integrated multilayer substrates will be built in a fully additive process using photodefineable polymeric dielectrics. The photopatterned dielectric will serve to narrowly define the dimensions of the integrated passive components. The approach is versatile in that it can employ a variety of passive and dielectric materials and is compatible with microvia technology. Only equipment that is already well-established in board and assembly houses will be used in order to obviate technology diffusion barriers. Apart from reduction of size, weight, power and cost factors, the development will eventually enable higher speed products, by providing termination and decoupling physically closer to drivers of high-speed signals. The current limit of signal speed using discrete resistors and capacitors is .5 GHz.

Driving an electric discharge with an electron beam alone is attractive since the electron beam's position can be controlled using magnets and its penetration into the gas by changing the voltage.

        "abstract": "Not Available  A magnetic flyer plate impact can be designed to accurately simulate the x-ray induced stress profile in a re-entry body (RB) heat shield very near the irradiation surface.  With the accurate simulation of the near surface stress history all subsequent vehicle responses must then be a good representation of those induced by the nuclear threat.  A Mag Flyer impact at atmospheric pressure is the highest fidelity simulation shapes the induced stress wave profile.  A major limitation on the accuracy and repeatability of magnetic flyer plate experiments is that the load magnitude and temporal history are sensitive functions of the flight distance.  When operating in air, the desired loading conditions can only be achieved with short flight distances and the normal RB tolerances limit the accuracy of the experiment.  This proposal presents unique experimental solutions that allow the flyer plate distance to be significantly increased while maintaining the desired load magnitude and temporal history.  These changes decrease the sensitivity of the magnetic flyer technique to flight distance changes due to experiment assembly and/or within tolerance dimensional variations and eliminates a major limitation of the magnetic flyer technique.  The feasibility of using alternate gases and modifying the capacitor bank to tailor the  gas spring  response to allow larger flight distances will be examined in Phase I.  Ktech's analyses have determined that the flight distance can be doubled by the use of an alternate gas such as neon.  Capacitor bank modifications that modify the ringing frequency of the bank and/or shape the current pulse will also be examined because achieving constant flyer velocity at early times also facilitates the use of large flight distances.  A Phase Ii program plan will be developed that describes the necessary modification to the DTRA Mag Flyer Facility to implement gas spring technology and the required facility characterization program. The gas spring technology will decrease the sensitivity of mag flyer techniques to dimensional tolerances of the test articles and will significantly increase the Mag Flyer Facility capabilities to meet specific experiment requirements in terms of peak stress and specific impulse.  Additionally, load uncertainties will be reduced.  The improved facility will provide a cost effective AGT capability for selection and hardness evaluation of new materials and the certification of modified systems.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  This proposal addresses the need for a fast running, multi-purpose fire simulation computer code for Weapon System Safety Assessments (WSSAs), with direct applicability to the evaluation of threats to/from weapons of mass destruction (WMD).  This proposal would extend the Isis-2D fire code to 3-dimensions while maintaining its  fast running  attributes essential to practical risk analysis.  The proposed effort would also extend the code's existing flexibility to address issues related to hazards associated with WMD.  In its present form as a 2-dimensional code, Isis-2D has limitation relative to accurately representing complex  real world  problems.  Due to (a) the highly 3-dimensional nature of fires, (b) the 3-dimensional complexity of  real world  environments, and (c) the 3-dimensional interactions between the fires and the real world, the evaluation of  real world  fires requires a 3-dimensional mechanistic code.  In addition, to support the scoping nature and thus the requirement for large number of risk-compatible evaluation, Isis also satisfies the necessary requirement of flexible modeling attributes and fast computational run times. The results from this research have several anticipated benefits to DTRA.  First, a fast-running, 3-dimensional fire model would help reduce uncertainties and reliance on engineering judgment.  Second, we have identified many conditions or phenomena where a 3-dimensional tool would provide a defensible method to reduce requirements for conservatism.  The ultimate objective is to reduce the likelihood of needless recommendations for costly procedure or hardware changes.  Finally, completion of such a tool will allow, with little additional effort, a general-purpose code for the analysis of fire challenges and subsequent behavior (e.g., transport, decomposition, inhalation, and deposition) of biological and chemical agents in weapons of mass destruction.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  To protect the US against limited nuclear attacks, the NMD system must operate successfully in nuclear-disturbed environments.  A key to successfully negating nuclear threat is selecting a battleplan that ensures that NMD system performance is not too severely degraded by nuclear effects.  While prompt nuclear effects are easy to plan around, persistent nuclear environments are more problematic, especially with the fast-running, lower-fidelity algorithms that BMC2 must use.  MRC has long been among the nation's leaders in predicting nuclear environments and their impacts on system performance. We will combine this experience with expertise in artificial neural networks (ANN) to develop and train an ANN for use as a real-time decision aid in selecting optimal battleplans that minimize direct and collateral nuclear impacts.  We will develop our decision aid so it can be used as an integral element in the BMC2 battleplanning process, dynamically responding to an evolving threat and providing risk assessments that would not otherwise be available.  It will assess multiple battleplans, then inform a human in control (HIC) of the probability of success and costs/benefits of each plan so they will be adequately informed when selecting an actual battleplan. The Phase I effort will demonstrate that a neural network can be trained to predict the outcome of a candidate NMD battleplan in the presence of possible nuclear bursts.  It will provide the human-in-control with an assessment of the nuclear-induced risks to the performance of vital elements in the system.  Similar decision aids could be developed for other ballistic missile defense program, such as THAAD, Navy TMD, or even the Israeli Arrow program.  The concept could also be applied to TMD deployment planning to minimize the risks of nuclear, biological, or chemical collateral damage to civilian or military assets.",

This implies that mechanical load based CBM offers an advantage where advanced planning of maintenance is crucial.

Compliant foil gas bearings with the ability to operate without DN limitations of conventional bearings and ghigh temperatures without lubricants have the potential to make significant improvements in advanced turbomachinery. One of the key issues to be addressed under this program will be the scalabiltiy of foil bearings for a wide range of applications. Design requirments for a broad range of both IPU/APUs and UAV/UCAV gas turbine engines will be reviewed, designoptimization tradeoff studies completed and rotor system integration analysis completed to demonstrate the feasibility of developing foil bearings suitable for a wide range of applications at reduced development costs. A universal test rig for use in Phase II will also be conceived and a preliminary design completed.",

Current trends towards engine designs with high thrust-to-weight ratios require higher temperatures and speeds to achieve greater thermodynamic efficiency. Commercially available sensors lack the operating temperature range, resolution, accuracy, frequency response, and reliability for instrumentation of advanced gas turbine engines. Prime Photonics, in collaboration with Virginia Tech, proposes to develop and demonstrate reliable, easy-to-use sapphire optical fiber sensors for the simultaneous measurement of mechanical strain and temperature. By combining interferometry using sapphire optical fibers with temperature-dependent spectral filters based on photmachined gratings, the sensors will be capable of measurements at temperatures exceeding 1200 degrees Celsius. During Phase I, the sensors will be tested in a furnace at high temperatures, and during the second phase, the sensors will be evaluated in a gas turbine engine test facility at Virginia Tech.",

The field probe of the proposed sensor will consist of electro-optic polymer integrated waveguides requiring no electrodes. This all dielectric sensor probe minimally disturbs the electric field distribution and is immune to electric discharging and arcing under an intense electric field. In combination with the fiber-optic readout, on-board aircraft monitoring and retrofitting to current system boards are possible. The thin film sheet-like sensor is lightweight, space saving, and electrically passive. The unique properties of the electro-optic polymers provide distinctive advantages over crystalline materials. The selective poling or push-pull poling of the polymer waveguide interferometer arm allows direct field sensing without any specially arranged electrodes or antenna. The low dielectric constant offers fast sensor response for transient phenomenon recording. The proposed research which is based on TACAN's electro-optic polymer device fabrication and test experience, will investigate the electro-optic polymer probe design and the material requirements. Prototype sensor probes will be fabricated and the critical experiment will be performed during Phase I research to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.

Although effective tools for urban EM environment characterization exist for simple 2-D models, the more challenging problem of characterizing the EM environment of a large densely populated region entailing numerous heterogeneous buildings and varying terrain remains largely unsolved. Revolutionary tools are required to address the complexity of these problems. These tools must also address the optimization of competing modeling and simulation capabilities, especially at the fidelity levels of EM and computer-aided design (CAD) models. The objective of this proposed research is to initiate the development of an urban EM environment characterization tool that uses advanced 3-D computational EM algorithms and CAD modeling techniques to optimize the seemingly conflicting requirements placed on the accurate characterization of the dense urban environment encountered by today's warfighter. This urban tool will provide means to accurately characterize the EM environment of densely populated urban regions, and will thereby significantly impact the warfighter's task of surveillance, reconnaissance, and tracking. It is anticipated that successful completion of the proposed research will revolutionize current urban EM environment characterization simulation paradigms for ground, airborne, and space-based radar systems.",

In response, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes Hartmann-autofocus sensors (HAS).  In the proposed HAS, the exit pupil of an imaging missile seeker will be divided into several patches.  The size of these patches will be sufficient to support a distinguishable target image.  In contrast to current Shack-Hartmann sensors, which need at least 50 patches, the HAS will require no more than 6 patches for WF retrieval.  As in autofocusing cameras, local defocusing will be determined by the relative axial positions of the sharpest images over the patches.  The local slope will be found as in the Hartmann test.  The combination of local wave front curvature with the local slope in the patches will provide enough information for high quality wave front restoration.  Finally, this small number of WF patches will provide an improved energy budget and a rapid response in the hundreds of hertz.  During Phase I, POC will undertake a thorough theoretical investigation of the proposed HAS and compare this approach with existing methods.  In Phase II, a brass-board laboratory prototype of the HAS adaptive optics system will be produced and tested.",

Free space laser communication is considered to be a viable, cost-effective approach in many applications requiring point-to-point secure communication. In one such application, useful for small satellites constrained by power consumption, a ground CW laser is used and a reflecting corner cube modulator is placed onboard the satellite. For such a system to be accepted, a high-speed modulator operating at 1 MHz or higher rates is needed. Foster-Miller proposes to use a voltage controlled diffractive optical element (DOE) as a high-speed modulator for this application. When fully implemented, the modulator will achieve a megahertz modulation rate, will have a large active aperture of more than 50 mm, and will be wavelength insensitive from the visible to IR range. One of the most important characteristics of the proposed device, which distinguishes it from other designs, is its very short response time consistent with high contrast ratio of better than 100:1, and large aperture.

In the loins Technical Architecture-Army (1TAA), there is little guidance concerning this issue. To forestall costs resulting from failure to reuse software in embedded system applications, a generic Reference Architecture (RA) is required to allow design, development, implementation, and simulation of software to maximize reuse of previously developed components. To address this problem, CHI Systems will develop an RA and RA toolset. The RA will use an abstract description language to unite the conceptual notion of software components with instantiations of physical components in order to form a specific application. Tools will be required to support the RA. The RATS tools include a repository browser to identify existing software objects, validation of object integrity, a simulation environment for design testing, design pattern recognition, and RA compliance checking. The Phase I effort will produce a limited implementation of the RA and RATS tools to demonstrate the utility of the concept. The Phase II effort will result in a well-defined RA for embedded weapons system software to promote reuse, and a robust toolset for using the RA to design reusable components.

However, the support equipment for these power systems, including the fuel delivery system, is not available at the sizes required to match the small size of the power converters.

This technology will provide the Army with a advanced barrier fabric for protection against toxic aerosols and biological agents in the Ions state while being highly permeable to water vapor in the off state. When a voltage is applied to the electrodes, the resulting electrostatic field provides a force normal to the membrane. For thin layers this force is sufficient to collapse the elastomeric membrane, thereby closing the pores. The magnitude of permeability for the resulting membrane can be adjusted electrically during use to control the passage or filtration of vapors. This membrane can be incorporated into protective clothing and/or shelters for protection against biological and chemical hazards, while allowing for the passage of water vapor. Eikos' specialty polymer fiber offers the best approach to a durable switchable membrane in clothing and shelter, that is comfortable, safe, and washable. The technology can also be applied as the basis for other electronic applications in textiles. Such electronic fabrics form the backbone for smart clothing: sophisticated wearable systems for protection, communication, detection, and onsite computer-aided analysis.

High-value machines such as jet engines and power turbines are routinely monitored by an assortment of sensors to produce a larage quantity of diagnostic data.

Advances in the theoretical understanding of photon migration in tissue, as well as recent developments' of compact light sources and detectors, have made possible new, robust and non-invasive instruments. Currently, optical detectors limit the usefulness of optical diagnostic systems for deep tissue hemodynamics due to their cost, size, or insensitivity to low light levels. The proposed work is based on recent hemodynamic sensors development at RMD Inc. and Tufts University. We plan to produce prototype components for a compact, lightweight, hemodynamic monitoring system, and to demonstrate proof-of-principle design for an immature, non-invasive integrated solid-state optical sensor. The sensor is based on the measurement of deep tissue multi-spectral absorption coefficients, in conjunction with the measurement of blood flow induced Doppler broadening on detector arrays with single photon sensitivity. Using oxyhemoglobin as a marker, this novel system will simultaneously measure the hemoglobin, oxygen saturation concentration, and blood flow in surface and deep tissues.

We propose to demonstrate a new heterojunction internal photoemission (HIP) infrared detector structure that retains the silicon substrate advantages of a Schottky-barrier detector while providing significantly higher quantum efficiency. The silicide Schottky contact will be replaced with a III-V thin film narrow gap semiconductor (InAsSb) grown on a p-type silicon substrate. Band gap engineering of the semiconductive materials allows optimization of the detector parameters. Performance predictions of the HIP detector based on a model of photon absorption and carrier diffusion indicate a potential for more than an order of magnitude improvement in quantum efficiency over PtSi/p-Si detectors .",

Unfortunately, one such missed opportunity has been the productivity gains and personal enrichment that can result from the use of personal computers. Access to computers for individuals with mental retardation has been quite limited due to several factors. These include a lack of opportunities to physically access computers, few training opportunities when computers are available, a lack of appropriate software, and cognitive limitations in the areas of reading and computer operation. Schools, families and service agencies are moving forward to remedy the issue of limited physical access to computers, but their time available to provide computer use training remains extremely limited. A general classroom setting for teaching computer skills is inappropriate for this population due to the pace of such a class and limitations in reading and writing. Additionally, most instructional software has been developed either for adults with no cognitive limitations or specifically for children.

The long term benefits include acceleration of data loading into DARE, an increase in the number of DARE data providers, an expected resulting increase in the number of DARE users, and reductions in the cost of simulator data management.",

This instrument can be inserted directly into a high power laser beam to measure the power distribution inside the beam with high spatial and temporal resolution. During Phase I AASC proposes a proof of principle demonstration with a 3 x 3 diamond array detector with 500 \u00bfm resolution. Two different detector designs will be tested: A detector array consisting of close packaging of discrete diamonds and a monolithic detector where one large diamond is subdivided into small pixels. During Phase II the system will be scaled up to a larger numbers of pixels and a prototype will be developed with an automated computer controlled readout that allows the display of the beam profile as an image. With additional calibration these detector arrays can also work as laser power meters. Examples of applications in which the shape of the beam profile is important range from laser based weapons and sophisticated plasma diagnostics to laser cutting of metals. The diamond laser profiler will be a key enabling technology in these areas",

This Phase I effort proposes to achieve this by continuing the development of the existing, commercially available Spectron DASH 6 Axis HMD (Helmet Mounted Display) Tester which already meets or exceeds a large portion of this objective. Research and development will be required for a field of view increase, supporting metrology and image generation. This effort also includes continued development of setup and automated test procedures which can be integrated into a user friendly, display test package. Implementation of functional bread boards and appropriate modifications to the existing DASH Tester will be used to gain empirical experience whenever practical. The testing of customer supplied HMDs will be used to supplement the research and development of the Phase I proposal.  BENEFITS: The proposed display test system would be useful to manufacturers of commercial and military binocular displays. With the economy of one testing unit, laboratories or depots could obtain valid performance comparisons between all binocular displays, including different designs and module.",

In this Phase I proposal. Image Corp, Inc. proposes a system for SAR-based vehicle detection that makes extensive use of contextual information derived from the SAR image itself.  Multi-resolution and fast non-Gaussian algorithms will be used to make the processing both robust and fast.  The key to achieving robustness is the construction and use of a detailed 2-D  site model  from the SAR image, which delineates roads, buildings, trees, shadow regions and open terrain.  Candidate vehicles are detected using a Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) technique followed by filtering and post-processing.  False alarms resulting from man-made structures such as buildings as well as those resulting from vegetation are detected using the site model.  Image Corp's proposal is based on the work at the University of Maryland of the research group of Prof. Rama Chellappa, whose outstanding contributions to SAR image exploitation are widely recognized.  The proposed work will be invaluable in improving battlefield awareness and in peace-keeping efforts.  Potential commercial applications include transportation monitoring and disaster relief.",

The research offers solutions to improved antenna performance, enhanced thermal cooling, control of ice formation and reduced enclosure mass. The advanced T/R enclosure design uniquely integrates a lightweight resin matrix composite material and high thermal conductivity aluminum cold plate. The enclosure mass will be reduced by 20-30% from an all-metal design. The integrally cooled aluminum cold plate will be thermally tailored to match the local heat flux of the cooled T/R modules and electronic components operating at 240 K. The enclosure design will address the potential of ice formation on the enclosure exterior. The 240 K operation improves the efficiency and rf radar power output of the antenna, which reduces the number of antenna modules, the overall system mass and volume and the prime power requirements. The research incorporates micro-channel cooling to achieve high heat transfer coefficients and high heat transfer surface area and incorporates tailored composite material thermal conductivities to address issues of ice formation. These features are integrated within a lightweight hybrid composite/metal enclosure that houses the T/R modules and electronics",

        "abstract": "Not Available  Mide is proposing to use Nitinol, a shape memory alloy, to instrument a parachute for measurement of the dynamic behavior of the parachute during inflation. The innovative approach, which utilizes the change in wire resistance as a function of strain (force) in the wire is robust and cheap. The system will be significantly more robust than an optical fiber system. The Nitinol wires will be plastically strained during inflation changing their resistance which will be measured by a portable data acquisition system based on Mide's portable data logger. Since the Nitinol wires can strain as much as 8% in the Martensitic phase, the measurement system will be impedance matched with the rigging lines and it will be able to withstand the high shock loads experienced by the parachute during inflation. The wires are also thin and bending them to small radii will allow normal packaging of the parachute. The system can be used over and over by restraining the wires through electrical heating. The Nitinol measurement system will provide the Army with an accurate cost effective, robust measurement system. In Phase I Mide will design the measurement system and validate it using bench-level and a 1/4-scale prototype. The initial the tests will be done under controlled laboratory conditions. Phase I will conclude with inflation tests that demonstrate the systems capability to measure representative canopy radial and hoop elongation forces. Phase II will demonstrate the capabilities of",

In addition, AVI will identify methods to facilitate the rapid association of security breaches to critical mission operations.  The automated or semi-automated association of mission areas to security events will streamline the process of assessing the impact of security breaches on mission areas and support the visual representation of that information.  Phase I will be devoted to defining the key information needed in the visual representations, designing several alternative visual representations, and demonstrating selected visualizations using test scenarios and a test data base developed by AVI.  Phase I will also include the assessment of available tools and methods for rapid association of the mission areas and security events.

In contrast to conventional characterizations of SAR clutter, which use simple statistical models for targets and background to predict the receiver operation characteristics of front-end detectors (e.g., CFAR algorithms), we develop a more general notion of clutter complexity that also considers the significant screening power afforded by target type-specific back-end processing. Our complexity measure may be computed over sample clutter image sets, and used to predict the false alarm rates likely to be incurred by generic ATR algorithms over comparable imagery. Our approach is based on constructing estimators for the density of target-like objects in the clutter set. In Phase I, we develop a range of estimators that provide different computational cost vs. estimation performance trade-offs, and empirically evaluate their performance. In Phase II we will extend our methodology to better address situations where inadequate example clutter imagery is available on which to base good empirical estimates of complexity. We expect that our research will provide useful tools to support ATR evaluation and performance benchmarking, as well as insights and theoretical advances that",

The proposed mechanism reduces light intensity in bright regions of the field of view. This is accomplished by varying the amount of attentuation of appropriate elements in a segmented LCD array that is located in front of the user's eye. Light intensity from non-bright areas is not materially affected. Current means of protecting vision are either totally static or else attenuate all light globally by slow chmeical means. The proposed technology is implemented by combining optics, electronics, and processing capabilities in a wearable apparatus. To be effective, this device should be implemented using small, rapidly responding elements in the field of view. This SBIR will investigate development of methods that will increase the number of elements in this LCD array. In addition, it will explore techniques to decrease LCD response time to changes in light intensity. These solutions need to be implemented in a self-contained unit.",

A key facet of our approach is the use of the Extensible Markup Language (XML) as the basis for the meta-IDL. The design of the component framework will be driven by the demonstration of a DII-COE-compliant application which uses DCOM, CORBA, and Java based components and, in Phase II, the demonstration of its bridging cross diverse DCP's. The use of distributed component technologies is, we posit, vital to the DII-COE framework for software reuse and interoperability, and nascent bridges have great potential in enabling a unified component framework.

HyperNex proposes to study the fatigue progression in martensitic steels, and to examine the applicability of an intensity analysis. HyperNex will then compare these results with the lattice strain throughout the fatigue life cycle. The program will proceed as follows: The martensitic steel samples will undergo loading. Surface and subsurface dislocation density and lattice strain will be measured. Results from the two measurements will be tracked against the fatigue life cycle. Validation of the life span map will be accomplished by interrupting high cycle fatigue tests, predicting remaining life, and subsequently cycling the samples to failure.

With this computerized system, optimal performance can be arranged at critical times and degradations can be avoided, scheduled at times of minimal workload, or at times when they would potentially have a least impact on mission success.

A portable navigation platform would use two speckle position displacement sensors and a micromachined Coriolis gyro as an azimuth reference to measure the relative motion of the platform. In an alternate configuration, an additional speckle position displacement sensor can be utilized to provide the required azimuth reference. The new speckle position displacement sensor uses optical diffraction from an infrared diode laser to measure position and velocity. The new speckle position displacement sensor is based on an earlier precision non-contact velocimeter, which was developed under contract with U.S. Army Engineers Topographic Laboratories for application in precision land vehicle navigation in the Position and Azimuth Determining System (PADS).

The program goal is to develop a system to obtain real time, CB data in forward areas such as amphibious landings, battlefield positions, or vacated/dewstroyed enemy positions and telemeter the information via novel monitioring techniques to the on-scene aircraft or satellites for integration into a Network Centric Command, Control, Computers, Communications and Intelligence (C4I) architecture. The latest command and control processes and mechanism for rapid automated battle space awareness will be implemented. A system design concept providing flexibility through modular packaging, method of deployment and implantment, autonomous operation, data storage, processing and monitoring is proposed. Novel system techniques will include deployment and implanting, sensor layout and packing, sensor configuration and chamber orientation, tactical employment (number of sensors required for each area search), wind velocity and direction sensor, dual telemetry and antenna plus growth potential for seismic and acoustic detection sensors.

Models will be based on currently available ATM Forum and ITU algorithms and specifications (such as Quality of Service [QoS] parameters) to the extent that they do not require actual modeling of individual packets or cells. The design will primarily use statistical and analytical models for the network data. The proposed effort will include a software description and design for 2D/3D visualization, graphs, plots, Call Admission Control algorithms, resource allocation algorithms, routing algorithms, and user interface screens using STK's Programmer's Library. The software will initially be designed for a PC, but could be ported to UNIX workstations by creating Motif user interface screens at a later time. The Phase I effort is only to design the module.

The class of waveforms called Continuous Phase Modulation (CPM) signaling, with Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK) as a specific instantiation, have been shown to be highly efficient in both spectral and power use. Such time-bandwidth efficient receivers are typically very complex, however, particularly when real-world effects are taken into account. Reduced complexity implementations are required for any practical applications of these waveforms. A recent, novel approach to time-bandwidth efficiency utilizing Per Survivor Processing (PSP) offers the opportunity to achieve large capacity improvements in real-world environments (including interference/jamming, dynamics, multipath, and channel non-linearities) while simultaneously reducing implementation complexity. PSP will be combined with other reduced complexity techniques to provide a highly efficient, yet practical design. In addition to analysis, simulation, and architecture development, a hardware demonstration of key aspects of the derived approach will be supplied.",

The technology will offer high cycle life, high energy density and high specific energy, as required of satellite applications, in a dimensionally flexible, thin film device able to conform to virtually any configuration. Energy density will be enhanced through the use of less electrolyte, thinner separator and lighter weight packaging. Additional features of the thin film battery will be thermal stability, enhanced through the use of a silica based polymer, and low temperature performance, enhanced through both confinement effects and the use of materials with high ionic conductivity. Finally, the fabrication of the thin film cells addresses manufacturing issues which have inhibited the commercialization of gel polymer electrolyte systems and lead to the success of solid polymer electrolyte systems.

A unique,  Alternated Layers Dielectric  aproach is also proposed, which would provide more direct thermal dissipation paths. In the proposed materials, the dielectric matrix phases are chosen to offer high thermal conductivity. The conductive, dispersed phase will be chosen to provide high dielectric losses over a wide range of microwave frequencies at lowest possible volume loadings. Both the matrix and the dispersed phase are chosen for their high temperature stability, and high potential for good vacuum sustaining characteristics. Data is shown, based on company's prior work, that suggests the approach is feasible. The Alternated Layer Dielectric approach potentially offers even higher thermal conductivities. The proposed program is based on Ceradyne, Inc. experience in lossy material development and manufacturing. A partnershp will be developed with current lossy ceramic users in the microwave industry, and with Oak Ridge National Laboratory. They have the ability to evaluate the newly developed lossy ceramics against BeO-SiC.  A susbstitute family of materials would be developed that could be used instead of current lossy BeO-SiC lossy ceramic composites. Current BeO-SiC is being phased out due to health issues.

        "abstract": "Not Available  The proliferation of the World Wide Web, high  resolution  printers, and inexpensive imaging equipment have recently made graphics and image processing a routine part of many common activities. Commercial software abounds to manipulate digital images. This proposal deals with a particular image processing function that has been much pursued in the scientific literature over the last several decades - image restoration or superresolution. The desire to see, display, or print small details with high  resolution  is common. In scientific applications, improved resolution of measurements may mean the difference between solving a particular problem, or not. However, real physical equipment is limited by physical considerations that make high resolution expensive or seemingly impossible. SeeTec proposes an unconventional approach to superresolution processing. Current methods provide modest resolution improvement, even under favorable conditions. These iterative methods are sometimes slow to converge, and require significant processing resources. SeeTec will study and implement a new method based on direct extrapolation of the measured image in some suitable basis or coordinate system. We will compare Fourier, Prolate Spheroidal Wavefunctions, and Wavelet bases for developing these new algorithms. The method will attempt to reconstruct information not passed by an imaging system, based on information that is passed, and a priori information about the allowable class of solution images, or constraints such as non-negativity of passively-sensed images. If successful, this prototype software will be refined and marketed as a useful tool in the graphics and image processing arenas.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  In recent years, much progress has been made in the development of mesa etch edge terminated 4H SiC GTO devices using commercial available material. However, it is found that further improvement in device's blocking voltage is hampered by the catastrophic sidewall local breakdown. At present, the underlying mechanism responsible for this sidewall pre-mature breakdown is not known.  A detailed analysis on the electrical characteristics of SiC GTO device suggests that hot electron trapping on the sidewall interface and the resulting local electrical field enhancement may account for the catastrophic sidewall local breakdown in this kind of edge termination device structure. Based on this failure mechanism model, two different termination approaches have been proposed to prevent hot electron trapping for SiC GTO devices. During phase I, effectiveness of the proposed approaches in preventing hot electron trapping and increasing breakdown voltage will be evaluated by device simulation and pn junction diodes fabrication; and more suitable approach for Sic GTOs device will be determined. Phase II will concentrated on development of large area Sic GTO device with high blocking voltage using the selected termination approach. BENEFITS: Development of high voltage SiC GTO devices will provide power electronics system designer with more efficient solid state power switching device with high power handling capability and less cooling requirement for next generation electronic vehicles and other applications. The technology developed will also be useful for other type SiC power device such as SiC p-n junction high-voltage rectifiers, which also have great potential to.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  Cornerstone Research Group, Inc. proposes to develop a new high-performance optical filter technology compatible with direct deposition onto a functioning detector array.  This program addresses the need for a laser protection technology capable of mitigating a jamming level laser threat at a known wavelength.  In this program, we focus on the development of the materials and process technology necessary to fabricate a self-assembled, high-performance optical filter onto an imaging detector array.  The filter technology is based on new advances made at the University of Rochester in Chiral Cross-linked Liquid Crystalling Polymers (XLCP).  These filters function in a similar manner to rugate filter technology.  However, this technology has several advantages over rugates for the proposed application.  The goal of this Phase I program is to demonstrate a high-performance rejection filter centered at 1064 nm formed in a process compatible with being deposited directly on a high-performance detector array.  In addition, a demonstration of the anti-jamming performance will be conducted on a working CCD array.  To achieve these goals the program will address materials synthesis. Film processing technology, an anti-jamming demonstration and the development of a detailed test plan to demonstrate both laser dazzle reduction and radiation hardness. Crosslinked liquid crystal polymer (XLCP) filters are a low cost, high yield alternative to high-performance interference technology for some applications.  XLCP filters are capable of achieving optical densities over a wide field of view.  Another advantage of this filter technology is the anticipated inherent durability to cryogenic cycling.",

CDMA technology can be used to provide cost-effective satellite network communications by increasing throughput capacity and providing better signal quality. Spreading the signal using CDMA also provides inherent military advantages such as secure communications and denying enemy attacks such as jamming, ranging, and direction finding. It is very desirable to develop CDMA based systems that can be implemented using Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) available hardware components. Within this proposal, PSI proposes the development of a CDMA Satellite Modem Design Facility that can be used to design and analyze CDMA technology for use over satellite systems. This simulation facility can be used to optimize the implementation of CDMA satellite modems to support military communications on the bafflefield as well as other comrnunication requirements that cannot be supported by terrestrial communications. The facility will also be able to support the stimulation of CDMA modem prototypes as they are developed. This technology is also being sought by the commercial sector. The Design Facility can be used by commercial providers of satellite services to optimize the use of their systems. Maximizing the performance of satellite system usage will reduce the number of satellites that need to be launched. This will greatly reduce setup and operation costs as well as reduce the depletion of available satellite orbits.",

While transmission loss can be reduced by minimizing waveguide length andlor by improving material quality (for example, reducing absorption or scattering loss), distribution loss is intrinsic to device design, as in the case of lxN splitters. Erbium-doped thin-film waveguides, suitable for monolithic integration with other guided-optic devices, are promising as loss-compensating devices for photonic integrated circuits and systems.

For comparison purpose, conventional diodes will also be fabricated by using the same fabrication processes to quantify the benefits of the proposed diodes including both lower DC and AC power losses and high speed. In Phase I, we will develop the fabrication processes for the proposed diodes concentrating on minimizing reverse leakage current, maximizing power density, and demonstrating high speed switching as well as high temperature capability. Comparison will be made between the proposed diodes and state-of-the-art Si PiN diodes in terms of free-wheeling anti-parallel diode applications along with Si IGBTs in 3 phase AC induction motor control inverters up to lOOOV750HP. We will fabricate the proposed 4H-SiC diodes and deliver 6 6A-600Vdc and 6 4A-1000Vdc diodes and one 20A-l000Vdc diode module with greatly reduced power losses and capable of 250 C ambient operation.  BENEFITS:  High performance quasi-unipolar SiC diodes capable of operation at much higher power densities and temperatures with drastically reduced DC and AC power losses. Applications exist in numerous high temper",

        "abstract": "Not Available  For many BMDO, DoD, electronic packaging and aerospace applications under consideration, both pressure cast and reaction infiltrated discontinuously reinforced aluminum, DRA, composites are candidate replacements for more traditional materials and graphite epoxy composites. However, the high costs associated with difficulty in fabricating prototypes and small production runs presents significant barriers. Selective Gelation Printing, SGP, is an innovative solid freeform fabrication technology that can directly create very high quality preforms from CAD-generated solid model, thereby eliminating non-valued added steps and part specific tooling. This increased flexibility will enable rapid design changes, dramatically reducing cost and lead time involved in developing and fabricating DRA parts from months to weeks. DRA materials can be designed and synthesized with novel microstructures such as functionally gradient compositions. Phase I will build the alpha SGP system and establish feasibility in building porous ceramic preforms with specifiable volume fraction. Test articles will be characterized for dimensional accuracy, homogeneous particle distribution, and volume fraction and to verify cost performance benefits. Phase 2 goals include developing fully integrated beta SGP system capable of faster build times with expanded preform material and design capability. Also integrate computer modeling and simulation for process control, materials and preform design.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  The overall objective of this SBIR Phase I research project is to further explore the feasibility of a radiation hard CMOS APS image sensors.  The vehicle for that exploration is a radiation hard CMOS APS test chip that has been designed, fabricated, and packaged.  This test chip will be irradiated and then its performance will be evaluated.  Based on the results from this test chip, a second generation of radiation hard CMOS APS image sensors will be designed, simulated, and made ready for submission for fabrication.  Photobit has recently completed a research project that concluded that radiation hard CMOS APS image sensors are feasible.  The combination of employing the physical design techniques of enclosed geometry and guard rings, and a deep sub-micron standard CMOS  fabrication process provides the path to radiation hard CMOS APS image sensors.  Utilizing commercial standard CMOS fabrication processes to realize radiation hard image sensors makes every economic sense.  The cost element associated with these standard processes is less (by a factor of 2) than that associated with specialized radiation hard processes.  The same amount of research dollars can go further when new design concepts are tested via the more cost-effective standard fabrication processes. Radiation hard CMOS APS image sensors will be a welcome alternative to the inherently radiation soft charge-coupled device (CCD) APS image sensors.  Radiation hard CMOS APS image sensors perform as well as CCDs, with the added benefits of lower power (10 to 100 times less) and integration of electronics (enabling miniaturization).  This allows them to not only compete in th same markets as CCDs, but also provide opportunities to expand the existing image sensor market.  The proposed radiation hard image sensor and the technical advances associated with its development are extremely important for space applications (DoD, NASA, and commercial satellites) and ground-based radiation harsh environment systems such as nuclear power plants, particle accelerators, and radiation test facilities.",

Their properties can be tailored to produce varying levels of high thermal conductivity and thermal shock resistance, low thermal expansion, low porosity, low density, high wear resistance, and high or low surface friction, while remaining chemically inert and maintaining their properties at extremely high temperatures. Current state-of-the-art technology for large/thick 3D materials (10X10X6 inches) results in a cost of ~$1000/lb. The main objective of this work will be to adapt and couple high-performance/low-cost 3TEX 3D woven preforms with large scale batch densification by Carbon Vapor Infiltration (CVI). The resulting materials will be completely tailorable and cost an order of magnitude less. This objective will be accomplished by reducing the cost of 3D preforms with the use of the innovative 3TEX high-speed/low-cost 3D weaving process. The lower cost 3D preforms will be densified by CVI in a mass production batch process, by 3TEX partner SGL Carbon Composites Inc. (Hitco), the world leader in CC materials and CVI processing. In addition to DoD needs, this new technology will be used to exploit the huge commercial potential of low cost CC pistons for racing engines.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  Multimedia applications are driving future wireless networks toward supporting data bearing services. Digital data transfer requires a much lower target BER and higher throughput than does a voice only application. In a wireless network, the communication environment is changing continuously. It is difficult to design a communication link that performs well under all possible conditions. Frequency hopping systems have been shown to be a feasible solution in multiple access systems while providing advantages against jamming/interference. Other strategies can be employed in conjunction with FH to improve system performance. However, these strategies typically sacrifice throughput and spectral efficiency. Under the conventional design paradigm, the link design is usually fixed a priori. Because channel conditions can change, the effectiveness of a combined spreading, coding, and modulation scheme enables the implementation of a transmitted waveform which can adapt to channel conditions and achieve the most efficient use of channel capacity. LinCom proposes the development of a multi-adaptive protocol in which channel measurements are employed to adapt the FH spreading strategy, modulation, and coding to dynamically maximize throughput.

New polymer melt processing technology which incorporates conventional extrusion processes will be developed for producing these new polymer/inorganic nanocomposites.  The new process will involve organophilic modification of layered minerals, promotion of polymer melt intercalation, and reaction processing to produce the nanocomposites.  The new materials will be thoroughly characterized by morphological analysis and mechanical testing.  The new nanocomposites will be especially useful for both of cryogenic and high temperature applications, can be inexpensively produced, and will offer important improvements in polymer composite material\u00bfs mechanical, thermal and chemical properties. There is an immediate application for these composites in liquid rocket engine components if they can be shown to meet the cryogenic and permeability requiremetns.  The Phase I will aim to demonstrate feasibility of the innovative materials and new process, test properties of these new materials, and provide a baseline leading toward commercialization.",

The project will be in collaboration with two manufacturing partners.  This strategy should provide the fastest and most cost-effective technical and commercial success.  The proposed photodetector is based on vacuum phototube technology with an active area of 1 mm2, gain of greater than 1000, and a bandwidth of 5 GHz which far exceeds the performance of commercially available large area NIR photodetectors.  In Phase I we will develop a computer model of the NIR photodetector and devise a complete set of device fabrication and characterization processes.  Phase I will show the feasibility of achieving superior performance.  The proprietary design is described in the full proposal. The Phase II objective will be the fabrication of an optimally designed prototype device and the subsequent performance characterization.  Phase II will demonstrate that this prototype provides superior sensor performance and will also address the manufacturing process to produce the highest device fabrication yield enabling successful Phase III commercialization.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  A technique is proposed for reducing the Noise Figure of a wideband fiber optic link by using an external intensity modulator incorporated within a microwave resonant cavity. The proposed innovation is expected to lead to a decrease in passive system Noise Figure by 10-20 dB and is applicable to modulation from low or moderate FR frequency to frequency in excess of 100 GHz. The modulator can be completely passive, thereby requiring no electrical power. In optical communication links, it is important to minimize the system noise floor and maximize the dynamic range. One of the key parameters for improved performance is VO, the voltage required to produce O radians phase shift in the modulator. This proposal addresses methods to reduce this VO value by using lithium niobate electro-optic Mach-Zehnder interferometers to demonstrate feasibility. However, the technique may also be used with modulators constructed out of other electro-optic materials, such as polymers. The program will develop a compact, low mass intensity modulates system ideal for space-based phased array systems.",

The need exists for a comprehensive methodology to optimize decision making organizations (e.g., carrier CDC/CVIC) to complete complex missions in the face of these reductions. We propose to develop an innovative tool to design optimal organizational structures to accommodate reduced manning. We will build on an existing team modeling approach that has been used to design an optimized CIC for future Navy surface ships, based on missions requirements, resources available, information networked, and doctrinal rules. Our method relies on practical design principles to guide the mission-driven specification of team members' roles task distribution, communication networks and physical layouts for command organizations. This process relies heavily on input from the warfighter and subject matter experts to define realistic mission characteristics, and to serve as evaluators of the optimized organizational structures. We plan to extend this methodology and develop an innovative CODE and Carrier Operations Design Environment, a team design an modeling tool for carrier systems developers. With this computer-based tool, we aim to move the method of organizational design from a heuristic based procedure to a scientifically based process.",

The NC1/I transfer system is one of several promising advanced chemical iodine laser concepts. This concept has recently demonstrated laser gain. The next step on the critical technology path is the production of substantial flow rates of the key reactants-gaseous hydrazoic acid and chlorine atoms. During Phase I, we will evaluate several concepts generating both species and then integrate the selected concepts into an overall flow reactor design. Key small-scale hydrazoic acid experiments will also be conducted. The resulting high-density flow reactor, which can be the basis of a 100-W all-gas-phase chemical laser, will be delivered to AFRL/DELC at the completion of Phase II. Other chemical iodine laser concepts can also be explored using this reactive-flow apparatus.

ART, teaming with Keweenaw Research Center (KRC) at Michigan Technological University is in an excellent position to supply an track system which meets the AAAV program office needs. ART is currently in the final stages of completing a lightweight MMC track system design (52 pounds/ft) for the M2 Bradley. It will be a direct replacement for their current T157I track system, but with a weight reduction of 25% and a doubling of track life (6000 miles). Shoe strength and wear are significantly enhanced utilizing selective SiC whisker reinforcement and high pressure squeeze casting. Shoe life is enhanced through improved shoe design and rubber components. It is proposed to leverage the technology and track design developed under this program to optimize a track system for the AAAV. Both single and double-pin track systems will be addressed to meet the weight requirements. This effort will commence by reviewing the requirements of the current track design and identifying changes/improvements which are not constrained by the AAAV. It is envisioned that the shoe body, track pins, track pad, and bushing sleeves can be lightened compared to the M2 track. Based on these considerations, the ART/KRC team feels confident that a track system can de developed in phase I and fabricated in Phase II meeting a 3000 mile track life, 42-45 pounds/ft weight (30% reduction compared to steel), and 21 inch width.",

Since all lithium intercalated into the anode of a Li-ion cell comes from the cathode, decreasing anode irreversible capacity and increasing reversible capacity will be much more effective with simultaneous increases in cathode capacity. This is MaxPower's integrated approach which involves three tasks. Task 1 involves R&D on anode materials starting with commercially available MCMB and Superior Graphite carbons. Pyrolyzed PAN-based carbon will also be investigated. This material is deemed to be a cost-effective substitute for MCMB carbons. Task 2 involves R&D on nanoscale size LiCoO2 with inert ceramic materials synthesized by a sol-gel method. The method allows for uniform mixing of active and inert materials and will facilitate Li+ ion transport across grain boundaries. The structural improvements in these composite cathodes will also enable at least 15 % more capacity to be obtained from LiCoO2 cathodes. Task 3 involves building, testing and delivery of both liquid and polymer 100 mAh Li-ion pouch cells.

Triton's unique approach is to integrate its conductive polymer technology into new epoxy-carbon composites and adhesives that will strongly reflect and attenuate HEMP and HPM electromagnetic radiation.  In Phase I, Triton will show the feasibility by making conductive-enhanced polymer composites for EM hardening, and will use an adhesive with matched properties to bond panels which will result in low Q enclosed structures.  In Phase II, in cooperation with a major composite manufacturer, Triton will develop one or more prototype EM housings for DoD electronic hardware, products for the military and commercial sectors will be developed and sold late on a Phase II program, and on a Phase III program. This Phase I Program, and following programs, will develop new lightweight materials that will provide hardening protection against HEMP and HPM interference.  The primary commercial application will be to the Military for use on aircraft, missiles, and space vehicles in potentially hostile environments.  The secondary commercial market will be to civilian ground, air, and space equipment, for improved operations in strong EM fields.",

Since wing cavitation is unavoidable for the given ship specifications, our principal efforts will be dedicated to reducing the cavitating wing drag, and a new inverse hydrodynamic problem to design a partially cavitating underwater wing will be solved.  The inverse problem of friction reducton on the wetted parts of the ship (such as a fairing) will be solved by a combined selection of their shapes and of the methods of boundary layer suction or polymer ejection.  A design of the future ship's architecture will be created on the basis of the solutions of the above inverse problems.  Research method to estimate performance levels will be based on CFD, and the research during Phase I will be conducted for a  pilot  2-D and for axis symmetrical problems.

SIMAG is composed of the optimum integration of two innovative technologies, namely Vibration Control by Confinement and smart sensor/actuator/active control systems. First, these two complementary approaches will be combined to solve the firing problem at the gun mount and turret interface location. Second, the combined approach will be applied to the gun barrel to reduce its undesired vibratory motions excited by external and internal disturbances, such as gun firing frequency. Conceivably, the proposed SIMAG approach could be designed to first passively reconfigure the distribution and propagation of excess vibrational energy (i.e., intentional confinement); and therefore, confine vibrations to certain non-critical regions within a structure. Concentrated passive, active, or smart damping elements or cancellation techniques will be applied to more effectively dissipate or cancel the trapped vibrations and to prevent an energy build up in the assembly. Such combinations will result in a significant reduction in fluctuating loads and deformations. The unique feature of our SIMAG concept is the combination of the vibration energy localization theory and smart sensor/actuator/control systems. SIMAG will make significant progress towards solving the firing control problems with very small weight and power pen",

To enable operation in real-world environments, the system employs a particle filter and magnetic immunobeads to clean and concentrate the target analytes in the solution.  A highly compact, imaging, optical arrangement subsequently monitors the sample fluid for a large number of analytes in parallel.  By using a photo induced immobilization technique, a multitude of different antibodies is immobilized on the surface of a glass carrier, each type being located at a specific position on the chip.  When sample fluid containing the analytes is flowed over the sensor surface, the top plane of the optical carrier chip is interrogated by an imaging ellipsometer to provide a spatially resolved measurement of the sample surface.  This allows precise monitoring of binding events to the individual sensor fields.  Use of semiconductor sources enables highly compact realization; employing several wavelengths further enhance the sensitivity.  The imaging technique yields highly resolved information about the binding status of a vast number of different antibody fields without the need for labeling reagents.  This system will be of high commercial interest for chemical and biological screening and for environmental monitoring applications. The proposed system is intended to serve as a compact, sensitive tool for analyzing environments on site for a large number of reagents.

This proprietary process, with which we have succeeded in upgrading dramatically the performance of an electrochromic polymer-based switch for rf electromagnetic waves, allows formation from its appropriately functional group-altered monomer of virtually any electroactive polymer, rather than the very few that lend themselves to casting from solution.  Triton is therefore able to design miniaturized conductimetric chemisensors with bandgaps tailored for differential response to the redox potentials of chemical-biological warfare components and ambient interferents.  We are able to confine deposition of the polymer film to the spaces between interdigitated metallic electrodes by making use of a company-developed thermally activated mask.  This production method both allows precise control of the (submicron) thickness of this volatiles-sensitive layer and further increases its change in resistance with analyte arrival rate by giving it a highly porous exposed surface.  The objective of Triton's research will be to formulate robust, long shelflife sub-ppm threshold response microsensors with enhanced discrimination of specific airborne CBW agents and precursors. Conductive polymer-based vapor concentration sensors are currently being applied for assessing the quality of food products and their as-received raw materials, the protection provided by packaging, and the threat from noxious and hazardous gases or aerosols in workplaces (among others, pesticide-treated areas and the ESA / MIR Space Station crew cabin).  Further applications in chemical process control and olfactory medical diagnosis are under development, as are those in the several aspects of detecting toxic agents.  The improved species selectivity, threshold sensitivity, and overall robustness of Triton's innovative chemisensor will significantly improve the effectiveness and broaden the scope of this automatic concentration monitoring.",

A requirement exists for an experimental methodology to determine the amount of chemical agent introduced into the environment by secondary evaporation and for data for chemical agent simulants for the nerve agents GB, GD, and VX.  The objectives of the proposed Phase I program are (1) to develop an experimental methodology for determining the rate of secondary evaporation of chemical agent simulant vapor when liquid simulant is released onto surfaces and (2) to implement the methodology for three chemical agent simulants and two surfaces (concrete and compacted soil) for several liquid deposition densities and atmospheric conditions.  The methodology will be expanded to address actual chemical agents and additional chemical agent simulants and their transfer hazard during Phase II. The experimental methodology and data will be directly usable by DTRA in its source model development for the HPAC and STEP programs.

Additionally, much of the training provided to soldiers relies on computer models and simulations of the combat environment. To date, these models do not adequately address the effects of training on performance, nor do they adequately address the interactions between factors that shape human performance. This effort will remedy that situation by developing methods and data structures that will allow computer generated force models (CGFs) to adequately respond to the key features of training. We propose a mix of model development and data collection.

        "abstract": "Not Available  The project objective is to create an environment for formally specifying, composing, and refining software systems at the architecture level. These capabilities will extend our formal design infrastructure, Quiver, whose development is ongoing. Integration of large systems is difficult and expensive. A one-time solution to integration, such as glue code, is not sufficient: components evolve, invariably leading to incompatibilities and new interface requirements. We propose a comprehensive solution to this problem via the use of formally defined interfaces that capture enough semantics to allow correct integration of components and software architectures, formally represented as coherent collections of components that allow system refinement and evolution. Our approach introduces formality incrementally into the integration process: only parts relevant to specific integration issues need be formalized. In other words, system measures such as evolvability will be proportional to the degree of formalization. This flexible incremental approach to the integration problem provides a valuable opportunity to demonstrate the efficacy of formal methods in large-scale software systems. The innovative aspects of our technology lies in the creative combination of concepts from several mathematical disciplines; the realization of the combined theoretical framework using leading-edge, mainstream technologies; and the visual interface to the semantic design structures.",

In a ferroelectric gate memory, ferroelectric thin films like strontium bismuth tantalate are used as the gate dielectric.  In order to prevent the inter-diffusion of the ferroelectric thin film into the silicon substrate, thin buffer layers like zirconium oxide and yttrium oxide can be used as a diffusion barrier.  The thickness of the buffer layer and the ferroelectric thin film will be optimized to minimize charge injection at the silicon-insulator interface and maximize ferroelectric charge retention.  The metal-ferroelectric-insulator-semiconductor structures (MFIS) will be analyzed structurally using x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy.  The electrical characteristics of the MFIS structures will be analyzed by capacitance-voltage (C-V), Polarization vs Electric field (P-E) and Current-voltage measurements.  Ferroelectric gate field effect transistors (MFISFET) will be fabricated under optimized process conditions.  The devices will be tested for memory window, memory retention and radiation hardness.",

Key to the S-Bond process are a new family of active low temperature(200-450\u00bfC) Sn(Zn)-Ag-Ti-X alloys that can wet and bond to aluminum, beryllium, and other metallic and refractory composites that contain graphite, carbon, alumina and silicon carbide fiber or particulate phases. S-Bond joining is conducted in air with these new alloys that directly react with surface compounds to form bonds without the need for fluxes or special surface treatments. This new metallic joining method introduces significant joining and performance advantages over fasteners and epoxies since S-Bond would eliminate the weight and stress concentration of fasteners and can be remelted to permit repair, where thermosetting epoxies could not. The Phase I investigation will evaluate and characterize several of the proposed low temperature active braze alloys joining several selected composites, including aluminum graphite and aluminum:SiC, a beryllium composite alloy, and carbon:carbon or C:SiC composites) that are being considered for missile and aerospace components. The objective of the proposed work is to demonstrate the feasibility of S-Bond joining for fabricating metallic composite missile and or space platform components by joining several simulations of fins/stabilizer structures, optical mirrors or antennas and/or electronic packages.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  This program will evaluate three submarine coating concepts, one that optimizes current systems and two representing entirely new classes of treatments. These are based on the precept that the limiting factor for coatings is the fundamental connection between static and dynamic properties which often requires that the most effective treatments have the greatest ship impact. The fundamental governing relationships are (for treatments in which the properties vary slowly with frequency, including modern designs) dictated by the requirement that the static modulus cannot exceed the dynamic modulus. This consequence of linear system causality is difficult to circumvent. The first concept is an optimization of the ratio of static to dynamic moduli of current coating concepts by crosslinking during or immediately after installation. The second employs embedded resonant structures with rapidly varying properties with frequency which can be stiffer statically than dynamically. Both macroscopic and microscopic resonant structures (using MEMS technology) will be evaluated. The third concept is a radically different coating system which decouples the submarine in a manner which may have controllable ship impact and may be amenable to mechanical attachment methods. The result of Phase I will be a downselect to one or possibly two concepts for demonstration in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  Among underwater applications lithium/water systems are the most attractive from the point of view of energy density. Lithium is generally considered to be too reactive, and evolves hydrogen as a parasitic reaction, but exhibits a very negative OCP (-3 VSCE). We have extensively studied the lithium/water system and have found that lithium in alkaline electrolytes forms a bilayer passive film (LiH and LiOH) at the metal/electrolyte interface. LiH forms as a thin, compact inner layer that forms on the surface of the lithium metal. The outer layer is a porous precipitated LiOH layer that forms on the LiH layer. The outer layer is found to regulate lithium dissolution. However, the passive film does not completely inhibit hydrogen evolution, leading to poor coulombic efficiency during discharge. We propose to substitute the naturally created passive layer with a cationically conducting polymer membrane, which is placed on the lithium surface. The role of the membrane is to suppress the hydrogen evolution while permitting lithium discharge. Our initial experiments performed with polyphosphazene membranes have been encouraging, but they point to a need to more carefully design the polymer in terms of the balance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties. We believe that the extraordinary energy densities that are available with lithium, together with the fact that metal/water batteries can be mechanically (and hence rapidly) refuelled, renders them ideal for a wide range of stationary power applications in both domestic and military service.",

The approaches for these objectives involve use of thin-film technology for cell components (graphite anode, polymer electrolyte and metal oxide cathode) to be carried out in 4 tasks. Task 1 involves selection of a highly stable and conductive polymer electrolyte over a wide temperature range. Task 2 involves selection of a high capacity lithium-intercalating metal oxide cathode based on LiCoO(sub 2) and LiNi(sub 1-x)Co(sub x)O(sub 2) materials. Task 3 is devoted to developing thin-film technology for electrode and electrolyte fabrication. The technology developed in Tasks 1-3 will be transferred to Task 4 where prototype thin-film Li-ion cells with fabricated, tested at MaxPower, and delivered to the Air Force for independent testing. Benefits: An expanded technology base with respect to thin-film technology, enhanced energy and rate capabilities and low temperature operability using new battery materials based on highly conductive polymer electrolytes will help push Li-ion rechargeable batteries toward wide dual (military and commercial) market acceptance. All types of portable devices and equipments, wireless communication devices, are key commercial applications. Flexible packaging inherent in the polymer-based technology provides another significant market dimension both commercially and militarily.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  In this proposal, researchers at Astralux, Inc. in collaboration with the University of Colorado at Boulder propose to form 4H-SiC/6H-SiC n-p heterojunctions for high power microwave device applications. Specifically, the goal is to commercialize a microwave SiC heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) with useful gain up to 20 GHz for satellite base stations, high-power transmitters and wireless communications. The advantages of HBTs over FETs are their expected superior linearity and current handling capability. A novel method of forming the 4H-SiC/6H-SiC heterojunciton will be pursued to form the base-emitter junction of an all SiC HBT. This method is expected to yield a high quality heterojunction suitable for minority carrier injection while avoiding the lattice mismatch and induced stress of a GaN/SiC junction. A novel self-aligned structure compatible with the 4H-SiC/6H-Sic material system is also proposed resulting in minimal parasitic elements and superior microwave performance. The Phase I goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of this tehnique as well as high quality heterjunctions leading eventually to microwave HBTs with 8 dB gain at 10 GHz and a power of 10 W/mm emitter stripe.",

Given functional or structural specifications in VHDL at various levels of abstraction (behavioral, RTL, or gate) and multichip constraints (pinout, die speed, multichip packaqe speed, die area, multichip package area, timing constraints including clock speed and throughput), our proposed partitioning tool will generate a partitioned multichip design meeting those constraints in VHDL. In this proposal we present a focused approach to establish feasibility of our partitioning algorithms in Phase I, and to (1) prove the concept through interaction with synthesis tools to partition high-level design in VHDL, and (2) prepare for technology transition in Phase II.

The LEOPARD(tm) (Light Electro-Optical Active Reflectivity Device) technology is a system comprising a large number of panels covering the surface of the object, with each panel comprising a number of electrochromic devices, and a high resolution color CCD camera(s). Our design will incorporate a distributed architecture with microcontroller intelligence at the panel level. For electrochromic devices with variable reflectance over visible wavelengths, we propose to use conductive polymers. Such devices can be fabricated as mechanically rugged, thin films on flexible kapton substrates, they can withstand a wide temperature range, and can be manufactured at low cost. In Phase I, we will construct several electrochromic devices of various color ranges and demonstrate the proof-of principle of real time control of color of an EC device as the video camera views different target colors. In Phase I Option, we will develop a preliminary design and breadboard a multi-device panel, and conduct preliminary environmental testing to select conductive polymers for Phase II developments.

Motivating factors for continued research in adaptive flight control technology include, but are not limited to the potential for reduced development costs and the increased design versatility afforded airframe designers. Although there are few adaptive autopilots flying today, some success has been achieved in industry in the adaptive control of air vehicles.  The price that is typically paid with adaptive control techniques, however is algorithm and software complexity.    These complexities increase significantly when the controllers are forced to operate in regions where the vehicle aerodynamics are highly non-linear.  We have developed a break-though approach in adaptive vehicle control that is virtually trivial to implement, is highly robust, and is easily adaptable to the non-linear scenario.  The proposed research will prove the robustness and technical feasibility of our adaptive autopilot design technique.  This research effort will also provide the opportunity to formulate the adaptive autopilot observer to include the estimation of non-linear aerodynamic parameters required by our non-linear autopilot structure.  The development of an adaptive non-linear autopilot will also serve to exploit and expand upon our existing non-linear design technique.",

The technology is based on use of semiconductor wafers whose local conductivity is dynamically controlled by laser diode arrays. The photo-injected plasma alters the conductivity of the illuminated wafer; by controlling the individual elements of the illuminating array, the desired conducting regions can be drawn on the wafer. APTI has conducted theoretical studies as well as proof-of-principle experiments of these photo-conducting antennas. The overall objective is the development of re-configurable phased arrays in the UHF-EHF range, suitable for operation as BCA's. The Phase I objective is to perform design trade off studies of the array configurations, wafer materials and laser requirements that optimize the novel re-configurable array concepts. Broadband vs. narrow-band designs, size and performance characteristics will be analyzed for implementation in the Phase II laboratory tests.",

InAs/InGaSb type-II quantum wells (QWs) have advantages over HgCdTe for applications requiring higher temperature and longer wavelength operation. The type-II QW photodiodes would have comparable quantum efficiency and smaller dark current due to a larger effective mass, and enhanced lifetimes due to much slower Auger recombination rates, and hence much longer carrier lifetime. Through careful bandgap engineering, we have suppressed the Auger coefficient by a factor > 8 for 4.5-mm type-II QW mid-IR lasers at 300 K.  With improved MBE growth technology, we have improved the responsivity of type-II photoconductors by a factor 50, due to the improved interface quality.  Currently, we have demonstrated among the best performance of photoconductors using III-V materials up to 14 mm.  Recently, we have demonstrated a four times better photoresponse of 13 mm photoconductor from InAs/InGaSb superlattice layers grown on GaAs compliant substrate compared to that on GaSb substrate.  In this program, we will develop both the growth of large two-dimensional arrays of IR photodetectors based on InAs/InGaSb type-II QWs at 8 to 15 mm and 2 inch GaAs universal compliant substrate technology.",

However, it is usually difficult due to time and/or length scales, or impractical due to the high cost of experiments, to properly characterize such chemistry.  Computational chemistry methods and computing power have matured rapidly over the past decade to provide fast and reliable methods for computing reaction rates for many systems which would be difficult or impossible to measure.  Several innovations are proposed to extend these methods to the high energy and non-equilibrium environments required for plume signature calculations. The overall Phase I goal is to develop the methodology to calculate velocity-dependent reaction cross sections for processes leading to IR/UV radiation from high altitude missile systems.  Specific technical objectives are: (1) Apply an electronic structure code to determine molecular energies and structures along a prototype reaction path, (2) Develop and apply chemical dynamics codes to compute reaction rate constants, (3) Validate the technical approach for calculating the reaction rate properties by comparing with available laboratory and field data",

        "abstract": "Not Available  Satellites are linked to an earth station by transmitting and receiving a microwave beam through antennas. The current antennas of choice for earth stations are parabolic reflector antennas such as those used for tracking telemetry and control (TT&C) for the AFSCN. These antennas are required to have horizon-to-horizon, full-hemispherical coverage and often several antennas are required at each remote tracking station site. A single active hemispherical phased array antenna composed of flat panel subarrays could replace all the reflector antennas at a remote tracking station site. The objective of this SBIR effort is to develop and demonstrate the technical feasibility of a low-cost passive subarray of radiating elements that will meet the requirement s for TT&C in satellite control operations. Alpha Omega Electromagnetics, LLC (AOE) will conduct a systematic and rigorous EM-based investigation of several new radiating element candidates that promise to meet the needs of the AFSCN system. AOE will employ proprietary finite element and moment method electromagnetic simulation software to accurately predict the radiating element's performance in the array environment. The results of this investigation will yield low-cost radiating aperture technology that is suitable for implementation in a passive subarray. The technology will be demonstrated with hardware during Phase II of this effort.",

This framework transfers information between processes at different resolution levels by passing data through an external process that exploits statistical or other appropriate methods to aggregate/disaggregate information to a form suitable for interrelated models. The approach emphasizes the need to retain essential elements of information used by JWARS across resolution levels. The construction of a such a  resolution interface  has at least three advantages: 1) a statistical characterization of a process leads to well established techniques for maintaining consistency between models operating at different resolutions; 2) it eliminates the need to modify validated legacy models/codes, since the  resolution adjustment  process is constructed as an external interface between models; and 3) the construct of this interface lends itself to implementation as a software object in the High Level Architecture. Phase I research will: 1) define the approach to MRM and demonstrate its feasibility on a simple proof-of-concept model of the JWARS ISR collection process; and 2) determine the detailed requirements for Phase II development of a prototype MRM formalism.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  One of the open research issues in the incorporation of battlefield stressors into CGF technology, involves the interaction of the external stressors with the personality characteristics of the individual war fighter. Further complicating this issue is the fact that the personality traits of an individual are influenced by the personality traits and the actions of other individuals (both friends and foes). Capturing this aspect within CGF technology is essential for producing realistic behaviors. In addition, these complex interactions must be represented across a range of stressor types in an efficient and user-friendly manner.  Emergent  simulations enabled by autonomous agents can be used to address this deficiency in CGF technology. Complex global behaviors of a group of agents can result from simple local interactions of these agents. Such a framework would be robust since it does not rely on rigidly scripted rules. It would also be more realistic since the interactions of agents could result in unpredictable behavior much like on the battlefield. We propose to develop one such autonomous agent model using a mathematical optimization approach which lends itself to the formulation of objective and constraint functions which can represent a wide variety of stressor models.",

Our proposal addresses using high-speed digital cameras coupled with multiple short pulse laser illumination and bandpass filters for this specific underwater application. COTS or semi-custom laser systems have been used. The system will have the advantages of submicrosecond laser pulses stopping the action of high speed explosively driven events, e.g., a shaped charge jet, as well as overwhelming the self luminosity associated with the event by the combination of the illumination source having high spectral brightness and a moderately narrowband passband filter on the imaging system. This proposal addresses the tradeoffs of operating in water with limited clarity as well as the survivability of illumination equipment and image recording system. The use of expendable fiber optic system for transmitting laser pulses and a periscope device for the imaging system will physically remove the key equipment to a safe distance where structural hardening is practical.

The Creare design is built around a novel acoustic array configuration designed to produce images of high resolution, compared to present methods, of objects buried in the upper 10 meters of the soil. Image generation and evaluation times will be significantly smaller than times required by current methods. The system features a sparse array of dynamically focused imaging transducers. This system leverages Creates experience in developing state-of-the-art medical ultrasound instruments and is designed to overcome the unique challenges created by the acoustic properties of soil.  BENEFITS:  The technology developed under this program will meet the Army's need for high-resolution imaging of geological structures.

This  MIT/RHL system  is non-invasive and may be implemented in either a remote or roving configuration. It uses supply voltage and current signals to determine instantaneous motor torque, and housing vibrations to determine gear meshing and therefore valve travel or position. The resulting  torque vs. travel  signature has been shown to correlate well with important valve faults such as poor seating, obstructions, tight packing, poor stem nut lubrication, and is expected to diagnose worn or bent stems. This system does not at present detect and classify motor or gearing faults (not a priority in the previous application), but the vibration and electrical signals now captured by the system are the signals of choice for such diagnostics. We propose to augment the current system with gearing and motor diagnostics, and then demonstrate its ability to operate in a shipboard environment. Although the present system is quite portable, we propose to design a board level embedded version, compatible with ICAS, as a Phase I option, for construction and implementation as part of the Phase II effort.",

This will be accomplished by using the recently developed cw Raman laser, which can frequency shift diode lasers to wavelengths ranging from 1 \u00bfm to longer than 4 \u00bfm.  A team including the inventors of this technology will do this work.  The first cw Raman laser was designed for low powers, operated with a photon conversion efficiency of 34%, and was accurately modeled by theory.  An exciting prediction of this theory is that high power operation can be achieved with photon conversion efficiencies greater than 90%.  Output beams will be single mode and powers of several Watts are expected using existing diode lasers as pumps.  The cw Raman laser obtains high efficiencies by utilizing the multiple reflections that occur within a high-finesse cavity.  This increases the effective interaction distance and also increases the pump intensity due to constructive interference of the multiply reflected pump beam.  The primary benefit of this technology will be the ability to generate high-quality, high-power, cw laser beams in spectral regimes that are otherwise difficult to reach",

Thus, the significance of the archeological resource cannot be determined.

Recent studies have indicated the potential of low frequency acoustics as a modality suitable for finding and imaging buried objects in soil. In the proposed Phase I program, we develop acoustic transmitting and receiving sensors, which are optimized for imaging in soil. Using these sensors, acoustic echo data is collected in soils containing buried metallic and nonmetallic test objects. By exploiting existing processing methods developed for radar ranging and medical imaging, images of the buried objects are reconstructed and evaluated.

TDA's NHGS operates with a very high efficiency.  This effect is due to the design of the novel steam reformer, which is the key research item in Phase I.  The novel steam reformer provides the endothermic heat of steam reforming and at the same time minimizes the quantity of steam required for steam reforming while operating at temperatures where stainless steel components can be used. All other components in the system have been used commercially. We anticipate that over 70% of the lower heating value of the logistics fuel can be consumed as hydrogen in the fuel cell to generate power, including the losses from 1) purging the fuel cell of non-reactive gases, 2) reforming the logistics fuel, 3) generating steam, and 4) the heat content of the exhaust products.",

CTI proposes to enhance the active imaging capability in the 1.5 to 4 -um region by utilizing a nonlinear optical (NLO) converter which provides frequency shifting to shorter wavelengths where cheaper, faster, lower noise, and room-temperature detectors exist. In addition, it provides optical gain, spectral filtering, controlled field-of-view, and superior rejection of background radiation. This results in an increase in performance to nearly the shot-noise limit without sacrificing ranging capability. Modern NLO materials can operate with high efficiency using modest pump sources in a compact design. The enhanced receiver capability reduces the pump power constraints resulting in a more compact overall system. Advanced sensor functionality including range-gating can be performed optically by modulating the pump source. In Phase I, CTI will conduct detailed analyses and laboratory demonstrations to validate the proposed concept. In Phase II, an enhanced-imaging breadboard receiver will be tested and delivered.",

The resulting, hybrid image can then be viewed by maintenance personnel as they perform their tasks using portable computers. The specification of the area-of-interest size and shape, the algorithms used to warp the background, and the pointing methods used to interact with the images are collectively referred to as the EyeWarp system. This approach to economizing a large image is supported by our knowledge of how we view our visual world and our reliance on awareness of the entire scene. Analogously, the presence of the total image is important in maintaining awareness of what we are looking at, and where we are located in a large complex computer-based schematic or diagram. In Phase I, we will survey the range of maintenance schematics and diagrams and candidate portable displays, evaluate the feasibility of the EyeWarp concept, and perform a series of user experiments to identify parameters that optimize the usability of the concept. Evaluation of key area-of-interest and warping parameters will be accomplished using computer graphics and image processing software with a desktop monitor, as will the simulation of pointing and warping. Deliverables will include a final technical report and demonstration EyeWarp software.",

This proposal is for a design study of a new 100Hz modulator which provides 600 kV, l (magnetic moment)s pulsewidth to discretely variable loads of 10 to 50 (omega particle). We propose to conduct the following tasks: (1) Design the optimum modulator meeting the specifications without regard to cost. In this task, the study will include the use of technology promising the highest performance and reliability. (2) Design the modulator meeting the above requirements with deference to budget limitations. Thus, for example, switches (as in the primary circuit of the pulse transformer) may be gas-blown spark-gaps as opposed to more costly high-voltage thyratrons. (3) List and establish availability of existing equipment and determine if a system can be assembled to the new specifications cost-effectively. In this case, performance requirements such as reduced pulse fall time and enhanced fault mode protection would be emphasized in anticipation of increased resources to address advanced development in specific areas.",

The physics-based approach employs material and feature typing at the individual pixel level to produce high resolution RCS maps, which can be used in both monostatic and bistatic applications. The scenes are deterministic and geospecific, enabling true end-to-end sensor simulations in real-world conditions to be conducted. The major benefit of the underlying physics-based approach is that the common scene data bases support multiple sensors operating at different frequencies, and that reflectivity characteristics from the scene can be rapidly recomputed as each sensor platform moves relative to the scene. Sensor/ scene interfaces will produce inputs to sensor models in both the frequency domain (spectral representation) and in the time domain (coherent I,Q pulse generation). The scene generation software will be modular, using Object Oriented Programming techniques, to facilitate upgrades, integration with large scale simulations, and interoperability with various sensor models. During the Phase l activity, a sample scene will be developed using the new scene generation algorithms, and validated against measure data.",

The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of the Travelling Magnetic Field Method (TMFM) for early detection of corrosion hidden by aircraft paint and appliques. The TMFM uses a novel combination of five techniques. They are highly sensitive IMTT-RF01 system; eddy-current resonance probe (ECRP); travelling magnetic wave (TMW) scanning system; giant magneto-resistance (GMR) element array, and artificial neural network (ANN). A TMFM probe will look like a large carpet that can be placed on top of the aircraft skin . A TMW is generated that moves along the X and Y directions. The ECRP makes the field extremely sensitive to samll variations in materials and geometry. The GMR element array picks up the signals. The IMTT-RF01 system amplifies the signals. The ANN provides signal analysis capabilities for defect classification and characterization. GMR field gradient sensors is used for lift-off compensation.

It uses many innovations to make this possible.  A  specially developed hierarchical solver is used to carry out implicit time integration in under 2- seconds per step for a model with 50,000 degrees for freedom.  An efficient contact solver is used to solve the contact problem with multiple rigid body modes and friction in a fixed number of iterations.  A special purpose programming language has been implemented to allow maximum flexibility in building complex transmission models.  Preliminary tests on 2D model of  a planetary system have shown that this computer program has sufficient speed to make dynamic analysis practical.  It is now possible to predict vibration levels with sufficient precision to resolve the effects of tooth surface modifications.  Bearing stiffness, rim geometry and other design considerations.  The objective here is to verify the accuracy of the predictions made by the code.  Comparisons with other methods like the boundary element method will be made. Noise and vibration comparisons will be made with experimental results available in the open literature.BENEFITS:  The multi-body contract analysis tool will enable designers to improve predictions of noise and stress levels in complex geared transmissions.",

The framework will be designed to provide a simple means of controlling the configuration and monitoring of heterogeneous sets of COTS intrusion detection and network security management tools based upon definition of high-level policy statements. A single, unified human computer interface will be applied for both control of COTS tool configuration and for automatic aggregation and correlation of large quantities of real-time events flowing in from these tools. The resulting software set will offer the potential for unprecedented levels of sophistication in automated intrusion detection and incident tracking and interdiction. The framework will: - Use existing standards-based management platforms, intrusion detection systerns, and security tools, - Substantially reduce the training and workload of network security managers, - Facilitate rapid and easy communication to command and control personnel, - Scale to accommodate large-scale networks and detect long-term trends that indicate attacks and/or impending failures.",

IRIA employs a human-like model of knowledge-base search, traversing a semantic map of available information resources in an autonomous and context-sensitive way. Innovative machine learning techniques are then applied to collate and analyze retrieved information for presentation to the user. The combination of these two techniques allows both  fire and forget  web search, in which the system collects and analyzes information offline, and  incremental  web search, in which user browsing of retrieved pages is used to automatically adjust the search in a context-sensitive way. The results of these searches and user responses are stored in the semantic map, both to improve the results of future queries and to provide a searchable directory to the information resources available.",

Similar real-time needs exist in commercial applications for image correlation, identification, and recognition for law enforcement, medical, security, product assurance, and other imaging applications. Since image correlation is computationally intensive, real-time processing must be accomplished by means other than available traditional hardware and/or software. The proposed FPR system easily accomplishes this task with rated processing speeds equivalent to 250_600 MHz Pentium III PC's. During Phase II, this speed will be increased an order of magnitude to the equivalent of 2500_600MHz Pentium III PC's by implementing the FPR as an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip-set in a multi-chip module (MCM) that is less than two inches square. The latter version will offer additional benefits in reduced power, size, weight, and cost while increasing circuit density, processing power, and throughput rates for virtually all image-processing applications. The FPR module is hosted as a Pentium PC peripheral processor with all the benefits of standard PC operating system, software and hardware.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  The heating of high pressure sub-cooled liquid coupled with liquid-injected two-phase expansion is proposed as a pathway to a compact and high-efficiency combined cycle diesel engine.  The concept is a novel and non-obvious departure from earlier industry efforts to develop high efficiency diesel engines.  This new engine concept avoids the high temperature materials problems of prior high-efficiency engine concepts and has significant thermodynamic advantage over earlier combined diesel and Rankine cycle engines.  The liquid injected expander eliminates the liquid-vapor phase separation requirement of conventional Rankine bottoming cycles and enables the miniaturization of system components.  Also, the liquid injection cycle has a significant thermodynamic efficiency advantage over Rankine bottoming cycles in this combined cycle and enables the miniaturization of system components.  Also, the liquid injection cycle has a significant thermodynamic efficiency advantage over Rankine bottoming cycles in this combined cycle application.  This thermodynamic advantage stems from the ability to utilize the waste heat of the diesel engine over a wide temperature range.  The combined diesel and liquid-injected expander engine concept allows for an economic breakthrough to a practical and highly efficient combined cycle diesel engine with a minimum of technical development.  The economic feasibility of this new engine concept is an outgrowth of technology developments in compact heat exchanges, two-phase expanders, small high pressure pumps, and electronic controls.  The power-to-weight ratio of the combined cycle engine should exceed that of conventional diesel engines.",

Total Ownership Cost (TOC) is an element of the acquisition reform and business practice reengineering currently being pursued within the Navy. TOC is a broadened definition of Life Cycle Cost with the addition of an array of costs previously excluded because they were not directly and exclusively connected with the particular system being acquired. It is now recognized that these additional costs are in fact relevant to the decisions being made regarding development or acquisition. The Parametric Assessment of Ship Systems (PASS) design synthesis model embodies methodologies for examining the whole ship impact of new technologies and design concepts. This effort will combine the synthesis and costing models to provide a powerful and efficient tool for determining the characteristics of the best ship capable of meeting specified requirements, determining the impacts on a ship resulting from use of a particular new technology, and determining the full cost of that ship or technology over its life cycle.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  In a highly attractive development, the U.S. Navy has been developing compact, heavy duty motors based on magneto-mechanical systems using metastable alloys(such as magnetostrictive or magnetic shape memory). However, a major obstacle to transferring these advances to practical systems for vertical and horizontal motion of deck systems such as bay doors, helicopters and stores has been clearly identified as the electronics. The fundamental operation of magneto-mechanical system mandates high energization at fast slew rates. The present use of linear power electronics is not capable of meeting specifications and incurs prohibitively large weight and power penalties for almost all ship deck applications such as machinery isolation or valve control that require the unique ability of magneto-mechanical systems to achieve actuation authority not available in ferroelectric mechanisms and devices. The goal of the project is to provide a full solution design of a compact and lightweight system capable of replacing heavy maintenance and power intensive hydraulic systems for ship deck operations. The proposed system introduces advances in switching topologies, components and subsystem designs for inductive loads as to minimize the weight and power costs.",

However, their use for radiation-hardened (rad-hard) microelectronics is limited, since there is no available set of rad-hard design rules. Therefore, there is a need to develop computational models, starting from high-fidelity physics to circuit-level models, and from them, derive design rules for advanced rad-hard integrated circuits. To address these problems, CFDRC in collaboration with Air Force Phillips Laboratory, Vanderbilt University (Dr. R. Schrimpf), and Tanner (EDA Division), is proposing to: 1) Develop guidelines and methodologies for existing microelectronics CAD systems; 2) Develop computational environment for generating rad-hard design rules from 2D and 3D device simulations, using unstructured, adaptive mesh technologies and advanced hydrodynamic (HD) semiconductor model, enhanced with radiation-effects models; and 3) Incorporate the radiation hardening design rules into a commercial ECAD system. This will also demonstrate the feasibility of automating this process. The success of Phase I work on submicron silicon transistors will set a good foundation for Phase II, where the methodology and computational environment for rad-hard design rules will be extended for: Quantum-Well Photonic Devices (VCSEL's) , MEMS, and Nano Devices (RTDs).",

Widely dispersed training audiences (particularly for WAN-based applications) require various levels of access control to training materials and verification of the identity of the person that is trained, tested, and certified. Smart card technology offers potential solutions to growing problems in the training industry. Smart cards can be used to verify the identity of the individual to be trained through the use of biometrics. The smart card can carry the prior training records and certifications of the individual that can be used to establish access rights and prerequisites for specific courses of instruction. Once training and certification is accomplished, the encryption keys stored on the smart card may be used to establish secure links over the network to enter the appropriate information into centralized databases for training management.

More specifically, it is now known that the Shikimate Pathway, an enzymatic pathway that provides essential aromatics, is vital to the survival of P. falciparum. By blocking any of the seven enzymes in this pathway, it is possible to attenuate growth of the organism. Since these enzymes are not present in humans, their blockage presents an opportunity to effectively and selectively treat the disease without harm to human cells.  We propose to clone the recently discovered P. falciparum charismata synthase (enzyme #7 of the Shikimate pathway) in E. Coli, by known procedures. Using the resulting product, we will then develop a prototype high throughput assay, which will lead to the development (in Phase II) of a major screening program of combinatorial libraries of potential antimalarial drugs.  BENEFITS: Safe and effective antimalarials could make a significant impact in human health. The proposed genomics/combinatorial chemistry approach not only provides potential new antimalarials, but validates a method of much broader application to drug discovery.",

Successfully meeting the goals in this Phase I project will provide an excellent foundation for the development of fully packaged fiber-pigtailed devices.  The key advantage of the planar waveguide router approach is the possibility for large number of wavelength channels.  The goal in this program is to develop reliable 64 x 64 waveguide routers for future Dense WDM-systems.  The proposed devices have potential for extremely low-cost production.  They meet the needs of the rapidly growing telecommunications market and have great commercial potential",

        "abstract": "Not Available  Naval and Marine Corps aircraft systems, subsystems, and components are typically designed to minimize failure due to severe lightning strikes. To minimize the effects of lightning strikes, the aircraft's exterior surface incorporates a copper mesh that is covered with an anti-static paint. This technology suffers from the high cost and difficulty of depainting and repairing damaged regions due to wear, tear, or corrosion. The depainting process is especially costly because it routinely damages the underlying copper mesh. A cost saving solution to the above problem is provided through the use of an environmentally stable, anti-corrosive polymeric/conducting metal composite appliques that can be readily applied via a peel and stick method. This proposal will demonstrate a composite applique that will consist of 1) a thin film of conducting polymer bonded to 2) an underlying low dielectric fluoropolymeric material bonded to 3) a thin film of copper metal that is 4) undercoated with an adhesive for application to metallic surfaces. This composite film is an excellent, cost savings candidate for paint replacement due to its inherent excellent thermal stability from -50 deg. C to +150 deg. C, resistance to chemical or physical corrosion, and low surface energy for reduced drag.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  Repairs to composite structural parts on aircraft require cure by temperature cycling to precise specifications. The environment is not isothermal, and standard heat blankets applied to complex shapes have non-uniform heat transfer characteristics. The presence of metallic structure contiguous to the repair area makes heat capacity effectively non-uniform as well. Consequently there is a need for practical means to provide uniform temperature cycling of such parts in field repairs. Jona proposes to address this need with a system that independently measures temperature at multiple zones in a control grid over the repair area, and applies heat as required at each grid point to follow a specified cycle. Compensation for heat transfer coefficients and heat capacity that vary with position is automatic. Objectives of Phase I are: 1. Identify other, comparably demanding field applications and determine what technologies and/or components may be transferable to the current application. 2. Determine the minimum density of grid points with which temperature uniformity can be maintained within specifications. 3. Develop alternative approaches to the conceptual design stage for comparative evaluation. 4. Compare and rate the design alternatives against specifications and select one concept for development to the prototype stage.",

This netting in past years was fabricated using metallic cord and at present is constructed from nylon braid. The metal nets were quite durable, but added to the ship radar cross-section and were heavy. Presently used nylon is lightweight and has no radar signature, but must be replaced every 12 to 18 months due to UV degradation and abrasion. Foster-Miller proposes to use Liquid Crystal Polymer (LCP) fiber technology to address the Navy's need for an advanced deck-edge safety net with a 5+ year life-cycle. In Phase I lightweight LCP cords will be developed and tested for their ability to withstand harsh marine environments and loading conditions. The use of fiber infiltration/coating processes combined with braided sleeves will be used to provide two levels of protection against UV degradation and abrasive wear. Furthermore, the outstanding strength and inherent non-flammability of LCP cords will enhance it applicability for use as a safety net. In Phase II the successful technology identified and developed in Phase I will be refined/optimized, and integrated into our teaming partners netting production facilities for fabrication into pre-production LCP netting suitable for shipboard testing.",

Spatial nulling techniques using Controlled Radiation Pattern Antennas (CRPAs) are very effective at countering jammers and spoofers in harsh environments. However, the size and cost of existing CRPAs make them unsuitable for new aircraft and missile platforms. Therefore, a need exists to reduce the size and cost of GPS CRPAs while maintaining or improving radiation pattern and Low Observable (LO) performance. There are established theoretical analysis and simulation tools which provide the basis for a new reduced size antenna design using higher dielectric constant materials. For example, using a material with a dielectric constant of 50, an existing element CRPA could be reduced in size from approximately a 14 inches in diameter to under 5 inches. These antenna elements will be prototyped and manufactured using advanced tools. DARPA is funding CMS and Raytheon in the development a CAD/CAM tool capable of depositing a wide variety of materials on diverse substrates ( any  shape). This new  mesotool , could significantly increase production rates, lower labor and material costs, and improve the yield for manufacturing GPS antennas.",

The ability to intercept ballistic or tactical missiles puts a premium on the accelerating power of propulsion systems, and consequently on the energy content of propellant ingresients. Under the proposed program, a little-studied method for the preparation of compounds containing azido and nitro will be utilized for the preparation of higher performance solid propellant ingredients. An important advantage imparted by azides is that optimum performance is achieved at relatively low flame temperatures, with increased ballistic control.  Thus, nozzle erosion is reduced while desirable high expansion ratios are maintained.  The stability properties of the products will be examined to determine if the materials meet the requirements of propellant ingredients",

In order to achieve the needed performance, new High K dielectric materials and deposition techniques are essential for the pursuance of the development of memory cells and advanced CMOS gate insulators.  The SIA National Technology Roadmap for Semiconductor (NTRS) has alerted the development community of these shortcommings, which may seriously affect the progress of the electronics industry. This program proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of a high purity novel method for deposition of new high-K dielectrics integrated with metal films.  The design intent includes high reliability (commercial maintainability) features at the outset.  The proof-of-concept provides a critical capability for engineering advanced integrated dielectrics with already developed metal barriers for the realization of integrated metal-insulator-metal (MIM) structures.  The deposition method enables processes for controlling dielectrics at the atomic level, while meeting 0.1-0.05 um generation needs (through the year 2012) for uniform, conformal deposition on large area wafers using low process temperature.",

Additionally, resin flow studies will be conducted to characterize resin flow front progression.

Peak overall efficiency of the motor and its drive electronics will be optimized subject to a constraint on minimum power output.

We propose the formation of hybrid materials, in which hard, stable inorganic segments are incorporated into a polycarbonate oligomer, in two different pathways; a) Exfoliation of silicates in a polycarbonate matrix: Layered inorganic silicates (e.g., montmorillonite), will be exfoliated directly in a polycarbonate matrix, and the resultant layered silicate-polymer network (LSPN) is expected to have better mechanical strength, chemical inertness, and toughness than the original polymer. b) Incorporation of silsesquioxane cube clusters in polycarbonates: Cubes [(RO) SiO1. 5] 8 have robust, well-defined polyhedral structures, and hence are chemical and abrasion resistant by nature. Appropriately functionalized cubes can be introduced into a polycarbonate polymer, by cross-linking reactions, and the cubes are expected to impart abrasion resistance and inertness to the resultant hybrid polymer. Commercially available polycarbonates will be used for the formation of hybrids. The effect of varying ratios of the inorganic to organic segments on the properties of the hybrid will be studied to arrive at an optimum composition. The approach, which leads to promising results, will be developed further to produce polycarbonates with improved properties.

Approximately 98% of all microcircuits manufactured in the world are housed in plastic packages. Ceramics will not be available, or very costly in the future because private industry is moving toward plastic encapsulation. Unless test procedures and acceptance/rejection criteria for space qualification of PEMs are developed, hermetically sealed microcircuits will still be required even though they are very expensive and/or very limited in availability. The problem with plastic packaging is that plastic materials are hygroscopic and contain brittle passivation layers, which are susceptible to stress cracking mainly from thermal cycling. Small amounts of moisture will lead to corrosion and, hence, early failure of the electronics. Because of moisture absorption and package cracking, commercial plastic encapsulated microcircuits manufactured today cannot pass at least five of the MIL STL 883 tests which, currently ceramic packages need to pass.

TeleSonic proposes to address these and other related issues faced by the \"invisible population \"in classroom settings by developing practical real-time speech-to-text solutions for educators. The hypothesis of this research and development effort is \"It is feasible to develop a practical real-time speech-to-text system for use in classroom settings by teachers, their students with hearing loss and/or speech impairments, and all other students, to provide a \"full participation\" communications system. The Phase I workplan includes: 1) identifying the necessary system components; 2) identifying related classroom issues; 3) acquiring and testing the individual components; 4) assembling and integrating the components; 5) customizing the software language and macro; 6) seeking focus group input, and 7) analyzing and reporting results. Anticipated benefits include new technical approaches and tools for teachers in supporting the mandates of inclusive education. The program should enable students with a hearing loss to achieve the outcomes expected of all students, such as a better understanding of the information presented, greater independence, productivity, and quality of life that promotes equity and learning opportunities.",

The objective of this research is to investigate a terrain rendering technique that combines benefits of both prior methods, without incurring the high compute costs of a full, real-time meshing solution, given the current cost/performance trends in graphic versus cpu subsystems. Factors other than distance, such as angle of incidence and complexity will be evaluated to select the structure of the image to be rendered.",

There is a desire to upgrade these systems to incorporate AJ antennas. This SBIR topic solicitation desires a FRPA that provides a minimum of 20-dB attenuation of signals that are less than 5 degrees above the horizon and 0-dB gain for angles greater than 20 degrees above the horizon. In addition, the antenna should mount conformally to the top of the weapon on a flat surface and should fit in the existing 3-inch aperture. Toyon Research Corporation proposes to develop a small FRPA that is designed to provide nulling of GPS jammers on the ground while still allowing reception of GPS satellite signals. Our approach is to use an innovative design methodology, which we have been using successfully to develop small, single element, AJ GPS controlled receive pattern antennas. Specifically, Toyon will use our techniques for designing Electronically Reconfigurable Antennas (ERA) to develop a 7-cm, anti-jam FRPA for retrofitting JSOW missile GPS antennas.",

We propose the use of hybrid organic/inorganic epoxy thermosets based on silsesquioxane cubes ([(RO)SiO1.5]8, where R is an epoxy terminated organic group) in combination with amine-terminated polydimethylsiloxane hardeners as fouling release coatings on inlet side heat exchangers.  Such hybrids would combine the demonstrated resistance of polydimethylsiloxanes to marine fouling organism with the direct incorporation of robust (SiO1.5)8 clusters into the polymer backbone, resulting in high thermal and chemical stability, low organic content, high mechanical strength, and excellent adhesion to a variety of substrates.  Our objective for Phase I is to demonstrate that these advanced coatings can be easily fabricated using epoxy-terminated silsesquioxane resins and amine-terminated poly(dimethylsiloxane) hardeners and that they possess the desired physical properties.  To achieve this we will 1) study the curing behavior of silsesquioxane resins with amine-terminated poly(dimethylsiloxane) of various molecular weight, 2) prepare a library of thermoset thin films with varied compositions, 3) measure their contact angle, adhesive strength, and hardness and 4) vary sample properties with the inclusion of commercial resins and hardeners.

We propose to use our optical design tools, laboratories, photoresists, spinners, mask aligners, reactive ion etchers and ion mills to develop the processes required to fabricate sub-micron anti-reflective features in HgCdTe, InSb, PtSi, and Si:As IBC. Sub-micron features will be etched into InSb and its reflectance experimentally verified as part of the Phase I effort. Processes for fabricating anti-reflective structures in HgCdTe will address human safety issues. Interest in HgCdTe, PtSi, InSb, and Si:As IBC process development stems from the materials' broad-band spectral performance as detector materials. Including sub-micron anti-reflective structures on these materials increases the coupling efficiency (air to material), thus increasing device responsivity. Birefringence properties of sub-micron anti-reflective structures can be avoided with two-dimensional designs. A 1-D Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis Code, currently operated at SY Technology, Inc., will be modified to 2-D. The Phase I results will be used to develop a rapid prototyping capability to respond to identified market demands.",

Computer simulations will be used to validate designs. A small prototype RPM will be built and tested to show functionality. Finally, a preliminary reconfigurable antenna will be designed for the Global Hawk UAV. The UAV antenna will be refined in Phase II with additional prototypes.

The error signal is then used to drive the membrane mirror to the phase conjugate of the incoming distorted field. The chip wil use a massivley parallel analgo computation algorithm to determine the error signal present during closed loop operation, when the turbulence is probed with light from a glint or a with a guide star. Our approach integrates the Hartman sensor, membrane mirror, and analog computation onto a single die substrate allowing for a high-speed, ultra-light weight, compact, low-power adaptive optic system. Our chip-driven membrane-mirror approach promises up to 8p radians of stroke, 10us response time and true-piston modulation. In Phase I, we will simulate, fabricate and test separately a proof-of-concept 10x10 smart-pixel chip. We will interface a membrane mirror modulator to the chip to demonstrate an optical wavefront correction system capable of 100 Khz operation.

Instead of exhibiting graceful degradation under stress these types of systems tend to collapse, degrading far out of proportion to the increase in demand or loss in hardware performance causing the stress.  The solution is to develop a new composable software architecture and agile run-time system which allows systems to dynamically reconfigure to balance loads and mitigate hardware failures.  The proposed fractal architecture will consist of three elements: 1) An interface specification and framework for coding primitive modules using traditional programming languages. 2) A new fractal language for composing primitive modules into components, components into more capable components, and components into programs.  3) A distributed agile run-time system to execute these fractal programs, which is able to migrate tasks between processors to balance system loads and resurrect tasks to recover from hardware failures.  The Phase I effort will design these three facets of the architecture as well as develop examples illustrating how the architecture would be used, how the system reacts to stress, and prediction of its run-time scalability and performance.  Phase II will focus on implementing a prototype and conducting detailed performance evaluations.",

Marine anticorrosion coatings have a significant economic impact and any breach in the anticorrosion coating that may occur due to abrasion or during docking must be repaired as quickly as possible.

The proposed repair coating will adhere well to underwater substrates, cure while immersed in water and have sufficient water-resistance so that it doesn't disintegrate and obscure vision during application. Our proposed ADHER repair-coating formulation will also provide good adhesion, toughness, anti-blush and water resistance properties, and will readily accept additional coatings that can be applied during dry- docking.",

Power dissipation will also increase with size.  The newly developed MOSAD technology places an A/D converter at each pixel, limiting noise vandwidth to temporal bandwidth,independent of array size.

The size, weight and complexity of these systems detracts from many aspects of rocket performance. A lightweight source of abundant electrical power could allow us to replace these multiple hydraulic and pneumatic systems with a lightweight electrical generator driving electrically operated valves, actuators and other devices. Recent advances in superconductor technology combined with the unique environment aboard rockets with cryogenic propellants may make it possible to build a lightweight cryogenic generator to provide abundant electrical power needed to  electrify  conventional rocket systems. The generator would become an intergal part of the cryogenic boost pump and would be driven by the existing turbine. Such a system could significantly reduce the size, weight and complexity of traditional auxiliary systems, resulting in higher reliability, lower cost and easier control, monitoring and maintenance. In this SBIR program we will work with engine and vehicle and superconductor manufacturers to develop the preliminary design of a 300 kelowatt cryogenic generator that is integrated into a LH2 turbopump. The generator will be built and tested in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  The explosive growth of information technology provides a tremendous opportunity for enhancing U.S. military warfighting capabilities. The management and processing of military intelligence information and the requisite assessment of enemy capabilities, intent, and objectives form a critical element of Air Force battlespace operations. Here, we propose an Intelligent Threat Assessment Processor (ITAP). Our novel system integrates a genetic algorithm approach to predicting enemy courses of action (eCOAs), a fuzzy logic-based analysis of predicted eCOAs to infer enemy intent and objectives, and in conjunction with our on-going development of an Intelligent Fusion and Asset Management Processor (IFAMP), provides the necessary functionality to support multi-level data fusion. We see considerable potential for this approach in enhancing existing Air Force tactical C4I systems and addressing future information dominated battlespace requirements. The Phase I effort will focus on feasibility assessment. We expect to: 1) identify system requirements and define the scope of the effort; 2) formulate and design a prototype ITAP for the requirements and the application scenario; 3) develop a working concept prototype integrated with our IFAMP system; 4) demonstrate its use and assess overall feasibility in a selected tactical battlefield scenario; and 5) develop requirements for follow-on development and product commercialization.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  The US Air Force has initiated a More Electric Aircraft (MEA) program to demonstrate electrically-driven power subsystems to replace hydraulic, pneumatic, and mechanical components. Essential to the MEA is an Integrated Power Unit (IPU). The IPU involves a rotor on magnetic bearings and a switched reluctance motor/generator requiring a high strength soft magnetic material capable of sustained use at 550 - 600 degrees C and 60,000 rpm rotation speed that creates stresses up to 90 ksi. The material must sustain this for 5,000 hours with less than 1% creep. Also, the hard magnets in the bearings must maintain magnetic properties at these elevated temperatures. Evaluations of soft magnetic materials indicate that though the magnetic properties are acceptable, the best materials suffer excessive creep. The need is for improved soft magnets capable of these conditions and ideally having maximal permeability with minimal core losses. For magnetic bearings, the need is for improvements in the magnetic properties of hard magnets at 500 degrees C. The proposal approaches the problem by using an inexpensive new method to constructing the desired materials chemically. The plan is to create microstructures with entirely new properties not possible with current magnetic engineering techniques.",

This platform features powered, omnidirectional wheels, a remote control operator interface, and compatibility with existing lift and materiel transfer equipment such as engine lifts and munitions carriers. With Cybernet's background in the development of multi-axis robots, coordinated motor control, human-machine interface, and control electronics, we will focus on the omnidirectional wheel technology during the course of the Phase I effort, culminating in the creation of a prototype omnidirectional platform.

        "abstract": "Not Available  In the manufacturing of printed wiring boards (PWB's), lithographic techniques are used to transfer the pattern from a mask onto a single large substrate. The use of masks for lithography inherently results in a number of problems: the inability to generate prototype PWB's quickly; the limited mask life and defect generation when used in contact printers; and the difficulty in storage and archiving of large numbers of masks. It is desirable to maintain a computer data base of PWB mask patterns (open called artwork) which can be used to directly generate printed wiring boards thus eliminating problems associated with contact printing. In the proposed Phase I program, we will develop the capability to pattern directly onto PWB's using a maskless technology while providing the additional capability of digitizing existing patterns on a mylar mask. This additional capability can be achieved by utilizing all of the existing hardware and adding new optical and electronic subsystems which are commercially available off-the-shelf.  BENEFITS:  The success of the proposed program will have a large impact on the economics of PWB manufacturing. Several advantages are gained Am using the same lithography tool to pattern directly on PWB's as well as reading data from existing artwork: first, costs are reduced since similar hardware is required; second, developing a read system on a manufacturing tool reduces development time; and third, in she process of scanning in the data, it is a",

A key technology that is being pursude is mostly passive MMW shipboard radar concept that offers the potential to support stealthy CVX aircraft carrier development. Two parts of the TPALS Phase II SBIR serve as a basis for this new CVX Phase I SBIR proposal. The first is an error analysis simulation that forms the basis for detailed radar model for the CVX> The second is hardware that is being assembled to demonstrate the critical aircraft and shipboard technology. This hardware can serve as the base for a prototype system for the CVX Phase II. On this proposed Phase I, the system concept for a quiet landing system will be developed. The output of this Phase I will be detailed concept fully modeled via simulation and a detailed design of the Phase II prototype system.  This proposal will develop a stealthy automatic carrier landing system for the new CVX class carriers. It will augment DGPS on JPALS providing a jam resistant landing approach.

New propellants strive to make spacecraft safer, more operable and higher performing. Propellant technologies have the power to make space flight more affordable and deliver higher performance. Propellants for in space maneuvering need to be ignited to release its chemical energy. The ignition concepts used today deplete spacecraft auxiliary power. Mono and Bi propellants uses catalysts for ignition. The disadvantages of these propellants are their susceptibility to spontaneoud decomposition due to leakage and their toxicity. The innovation described here utilizes a piezoelectrical element for the ignition of propellants. The device uses the dynamic pressure of the propellant in the feed line to strain a piezo element and thus generate an electrical charge. The charge is used for ignition by means of a spark or other ignition concepts. The advantage is a low cost simple and reliable concept that does not deplete spacecraft power.",

This work addresses all of these problems through the use of high-strength composite materials and integration of the jet drive intake duct into the hull of the vessel at the time of hull fabrication.  Novel mechanical configuration of drive components removes the high stresses normal in conventional drive intake ducts, allowing a composite intake to be integrated into a composite hull at low cost.  Collateral advantages of this novel approach are a reduction in the number of components and in total drive unit weight.  Additionally, it allows the placement of the engine closer to the transom with no compromise to the intake performance. Work includes hydrodynamic optimization of the intake shape to assure performance superior to comparable metallic jet drives.  A prototype unit based on the novel design is constructed, installed and tested, and measured data are used to predict the performance of an 11 meter RIB with two such drives installed. Some drive components, in addition to the intake, are also made of composite materials, leading in the future to a truly all-composite waterjet propulsion system.",

Current solutions have reached functional limitations, therefore identifying the need for increased performance from thermal management materials and waste heat rejection systems.  DARPA's Megawatt Solid-State Electronics Program is focused on efficient switches operating in power ranges between 100 kW to 1 MW.  Fabrication procedures and packaging techniques are being developed to integrate high-voltage, high current switches with control electronics and sensors having compatible electrical characteristics.  Packaging is critical because it must provide good thermal management over wide temperature ranges and in potentially harsh environments.  To take full advantage of the superior properties of SiC compared to Si, these packages must operate up to roughly 300 C and dissipate power loss in the switches of many kW/cm2.  k Technology Corporation (kTC) proposes to develop a high performance electronic package material with high conductivity (>1000W/mK), and low coefficient of thermal expansion (6.5 ppm/K).

The critical elements are an ultracompact off-axis telescope, a microlens array-based limiter, and a regionally adaptive attenuator. The advantages of this innovative concept include its simple and compact structure, broadband response (400-700 nm), fast protection, high dynamic range, regionally adaptive dimming, effective glare reduction, and high transmission for dimmer objects. The major innovation of this proposal is that it combines the advantages of a high speed and high dynamic range optical limiter with the smooth adaptation characteristic of a glare reduction attenuator. This breakthrough technology has important potential applications because it can be manufactured using low-cost materials and mature fabrication techniques. In Phase I, POC will design and build key components and analyze their performance; the concept will be demonstrated by means of a laboratory prototype.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  Active acoustic detection of underwater targets generally relies on reflection of the incoming sound energy.  For a monostatic sonar attempting to detect a submarine target, the strongest signal return is a specular reflection from beam aspect.  For a bistatic sonar, where the source and receiver are separated, the strongest return is a specular reflection.  This SBIR proposes the exploitation of an additional signal path which is the result of acoustic scattering phenomena of targets.  We believe this additional signal path will significantly increase the number of detection opportunities and will translate into increased mission effectiveness.  The air ASW platform is the proposed commercial application for this technology.  The air ASW platform is capable of deploying a distributed sonobuoy field which is ideally suited to take advantage of this signal.   The existence of this signal path has been verified by the U.S. Navy.  A few data samples of this scattering phenomena were obtained in one or two NAWC sea tests.  This proposal provides an innovative approach to estimating the field performance improvement and the signal processing required to exploit this acoustic scattering phenomena.",

Such a coating system eliminates the costly and cumbersome practice of welding titanium in an inert atmosphere created using complicated shrouds or within a dedicated enclosed chamber. The coating process offers the advantages of: (1) shielding titanium at elevated temperatures from embrittlement due to its reactivity with oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen, and (2) retarding liberation of hydrogen through the formation of insoluble compounds that reduce the porosity of the resultant welds. Additionally, plasma spraying itself is inherently inexpensive, easily scaled to production scenarios, and features high, controllable deposition rates. In Phase I, we propose to prepare and test sample coupons with various plasma-sprayed flux coatings to provide a basis for assessment of the suitability of these materials for this application. We will also use the Gas Tungsten Arc Welding process to produce and test sample welds on titanium alloys coated with the proposed fluxes. The flux coating process developed in Phase I makes possible the development of a synthesized welding/coating system in Phase II.  BENEFITS:  The proposed flux coating process is expected to: (1) broaden significantly the application of titanium alloys for both military and commercial use, and (2) permit the use of welding processes that offer high weld rates such as Gas Metal Arc and Pla",

Solving this challenging technical problem will permit better design for both military and civilian parachutes, in terms of structural parameters and selection of materials. As a cost-effective solution to the current practice of overdesigning parachutes, a novel methodology for real-time characterization of the structural behavior of parachutes during inflation is proposed. This method is based on the application of fiber optic sensors embedded into the parachute fabric. Sensor measurements will be supported by mechanical testing and modeling. Two types of fiber optic sensors will be used to measure axial, bi-axial, and transverse deformation of a parachute canopy and suspension lines. An optical fiber Bragg grating (FBG) type sensor will be used as a short strain gauge for axial strain measurements. The second tripe of fiber optic sensors is based on the Modal Power Distribution (MPD) technique, developed by M. El-Sherif (project director) through several Army and DoD projects. Acting as a long length strain gauge, this is also the only sensor tripe that can be used in measuring transverse stresses. The integration of these two types will form a novel sensory system capable of measuring the dynamic structural behavior of a parachute during inflation. Axial, bi-axial, and drop lab tests, will be conducted to demonstrate the concept of the proposed met",

Orbital Research proposes developing an insect-like set of artificial reflexes - BioSeek - to enable autonomous munitions instant targeting and replanning capability. BioSeek will unionize two innovative biologically inspired technologies. The first, the Biologically Inspired Autonomous Vehicle Escape Reflex Tactic, or BioAVERT is a.neural map of an insect's motion reflex. The second, the Mulitresolution Automated Path Planning Evolutionary Routing or MAPPER genetic algorithm, is an automated path planner mimicking natural selection. The BioSeek targeting reflex will invert BiOAVERT for instantaneous targeting for autonomous munitions by implementing MAPPER to generate base sets of targeting patterns, then feeding them to BioAVERT to instantly elicit appropriate targeting patterns while still avoiding collisions with obstacles other than the target.",

Conventional airborne and ground sensor systems, use spatial information to detect and recognize targets. However, current automatic target detection techniques cannot readily find camouflaged or hidden targets. Furthermore, active Doppler detection cannot handle targets with zero or near-zero velocity. Multispectral and hyperspectral sensors can enhance target detection and recognition by increasing probability of detection and lowering false alarm rates for low signature moving targets.  Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop an innovative multispectral moving target detection (M~D) system, which applies both spectral and spatial detection filters, and performs spatial-spectral data fusion, multispectral, hyperspectral, and spatial detection, and correlates movement measurement to precisely detect and locate targets. The goal of this Phase I project is to optimally combine results from spatially based detection with high-resolution fast spectral imaging and spectral-based discrimination techniques. The proposed spatial-spectral detection will combine POC's multi-sensor data fusion, correlation target tracking, and efficient linear and nonlinear spatial filtering for clutter reduction, detection, identification, and tracking of military targets.

Conventional methods of solid freeform fabrication have been used to produce ceramic materials, but it is difficult to make a material that sinters to its full density without deformation due to shrinkage. SLS is useful in producing intricate parts while overcoming these problems, but because of the low packing density of the powder beds being sintered, a porous ceramic results. By using a green material in the SLS, process with a higher packing density, an improved ceramic material will be obtained. Zirconia promises to be a good material for fabrication of parts that require erosion and corrosion resistance, high stiffness and deformation resistance such as diesel engine parts. However, it is very difficult to produce the fine structure necessary in these parts by traditional ceramic processing. TDA will team with a large ceramics manufacturer to produce a fabrication method using SLS to sinter a high density zirconia medium to produce a refractory ceramic part for a diesel engine from a CAD model. This method will be applicable to the production of parts from other materials with minimal equipment and design changes.  BENEFITS:  The SLS method developed in this work will produce intricate parts from high density refractory ceramics in a short time without part specific tooling.

However, materiel handling is time-consuming and expensive, primarily because it requires extensive human labor. When working with hazardous environments or materials, the expense increases dramatically.  Today's automated handling systems must be teleoperated-painstakingly controlled remotely by an active human operator. Teleoperated systems are slow, clumsy, and fundamentally expensive.  The technology exists to build handling systems that can operate more automatically. Vision systems, robotics, motor control, force sensing, user interfaces, and even grasping are reasonably well understood and available components.

Electrical interconnects fail to keep up with this new demand due to their basic limitations. Optical interconnects and devices inherently offer large bandwidth and hence high-speed operation.

Employment of the WDDM device significantly increases the aggregate bandwidth to well above 10 Gb/sec while minimizing the latency of data transfer. Furthermore, the employment of an innovative three-dimensionally-tapered waveguide will significantly reduce the system insertion loss and thus achieve high fidelity of data transmission. Experimental result shows that each WDDM wavelength channel can provide 2,500 Gb/sec. Consequently, the projected target of throughput enhancement will be achieved.

We propose to optimize low cost MEMS inertial sensors to capture the relativity low bandwidth of human dynamics. Laser trimming of vibrating sensor elements can enhance the signal level by an order of magnitude for band limited motion, proportionally reducing electronics errors and allowing mass produced sensors to be used for demanding augmented reality applications. All inertial sensors measure rates of change, so eventually have to be calibrated with direct angular and positional measurements. Rather than rediscover optimal sensor fusion, in this project we apply knowledge developed by the guided missile and inertial navigation communities. For latency correction, we will use GINI, a COTS computer code developed for tightly coupled, GPS/Inertial Navigation system integration. The new AHRS grade Endevco Micromachined Accelerometer Gyro (MAG), and a Systron Donnor QRS will be analyzed in this new inertially aided tracker with optimal prediction capability.",

It includes a hybrid MCM package housing a 6-switch bridge IGBT inverter and a integrated low-cost microchannel heat sink into the package body. Advanced ceramics and composites are selected for the packaging system for the miniaturization, weight and cost saving. The proposed microchannel heat sink uses water ethylene glycol coolant such that the existing engine cooling system on the vehicle can be utilized to provide the coolant circulation. This integrated design is aimed to save the weight and volume of this packaging system to the maximum extent to meet the current Future Combat System requirements. The cost of the proposed microchannel heat sink is estimated to be a very small fraction of the LLNL microgroove heat sinks based on the selected material and fabrication technique. The thermal resistance of the heat sink will be at the level of 0.02 degrees Celsius/(W/cm2). The dual purpose design enables this packaging system to be used both for the silicon devices at the power rating of 750 hp 3-phase AC and for the future SiC devices at 1500 hp and hither.  BENEFITS:  Power conditioning packaging systems based on this proposal could be used in civilian and military electric drive vehicles. A series of derivatives of this packaging system could be used in a large number of electric motor controls. High interest on this technology h",

The ambient temperature process will produce nanocrystalline or amorphous DLC films on a wide variety of substrates without damaging the substrate material or introducing high thermal mismatch stresses. Various chemical precursors and experimental conditions will be investigated in Phase I. The deposited DLC film will be characterized by x-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. The resulting DLC films will be exhibiting a high degree of sp3 carbon bonding and very high electrical resistance.

Antenna steering is not required. Range resolution is obtained with a stepped frequency waveform and accurate terrain elevation relative to the vehicle is obtained with the aperture generated by the vehicle's forward motion. High quality SAR imaging is possible in the presence of severe motion irregularities because of a reliable, high accuracy, computationally efficient, auto-focus / autonomous-motion-compensation technique developed by GORCA Technologies (GT) to focus data in the presence of severe motion irregularities without the uuse of INS, GPS, nor any of the external data source.

GT is currently building a tiny mm-wave sensor prototype for side-looking SAR imaging from a small UAV.

A measurement system is proposed that incorporates innovative methods of measuring one point on the rail relative to a second, located 26 to 52 inches further down the track with an accuracy of \u00c2\u00bf0.001 inches. A diffractive grating is utilized to produce two beams that are subsequently recombined in a manner that allows rotational errors of less than a microradian to be detected and thereby eliminated from the measurement. Cumulative errors over multiple measurements points are corrected by an imaging system that is periodically used to reference the rail-to-rail measurements back to the DMA (Defense Mapping Agency) benchmarks located along the track. Even without referencing to these benchmarks, the resulting system will produce automated measurements along the entire track of lateral and vertical deviations with an accuracy of \u00c2\u00bf0.01 inches for any 400-foot section, or \u00c2\u00bf0.110 inches along the entire 50,000 feet of track.

The cornerstone for multimedia is Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATE, foreseen as the technology of the future Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network (13-ISDN). Real-time multimedia, unlike traditional data transfer applications, have stringent simultaneous requirements in terms of loss and delay jitter. Traditional protocol layers do not have appropriate mechanisms to provide the required network quality of service for such VBR multimedia applications. This lack of functionality calls for the design of protocol layers to handle the stringent requirements of multimedia applications. Also, one of the major drawbacks of ATM technology today is its inability to support security. ATM will likely be used in the future for mission-critical information transfer, like financial transactions and military communications. Carrying such sensitive information will make ATM networks very lucrative to break into. To exploit its full potential, there is an urgent need to incorporate security features into ATM protocol layers. In this proposal, we analyze the requirements for transporting real-time multimedia traffic over ATM. ATM protocol layer functionality is designed based on these requirements. Also, threats to ATM are identified and different options to counter them are presented.  BENEFITS:  ATM is the leading networking technology of the future. Compressed voice",

The concept is to use an array of scientific grade 1024x128 CCDs that are fiber optically coupled to a scintillator in a staggered over-under arrangement extenable indefinitely in width.  The multi-row CCD allows data collection software to create virtual detectors with variable focus for maximum flexibility of scanner geometry catering to multiple sources and focus sizes on a single system.  Sample overlap via software also maximizes the spatial resolution for the rotate-only scanning mode.  The virtual detector aperture can also be varied by software to allow tradeoffs of resolution, contrast, and scan time.  The concept will be demonstrated by constructing a two device prototype detector, writing the virtual detector data collection software, and measuring the performance of the detector using a 420 kV, 0.8 mm x-ray source.  A Varian amorphous silicon flat panel detector will also be evaluated by collecting data with the same x-ray source and comparing it to the prototype line array detector performance.

Microsensor networks are an example of autonomous wireless local area networks (AWLANs).  These networks are designed to be self-organizing in the sense of establishing and maintaining their own network without the aid of any established infrastructure or centralized administration. The mobile computing devices in a tactical AWLAN are generally resource constrained in terms of processing power and battery life and must be built to stringent size, weight, and power specifications. AWLANs, especially microsensor networks, may be required to function in extremely hostile environments. This project will develop a multipolicy approach to information assurance for AWLANs.  Multiple quality of protection profiles will be developed and ranked according to resource utilization and the desired level of security and fault tolerance. Different types of data will be ranked according to its sensitivity, importance, timeliness and priority.  These profiles and types will be used to optimize the assignment of information assurance resources so that resource utilization is commensurate with the data ranking.

        "abstract": "Not Available  In 1997, LET Corporation, under contract with the Naval Sea Systems Command completed the conceptual design of a novel source that is capable of providing an ultra broadband radiation spectrum that extends from approximately 2 to 16 microns. These studies show that the source can produce high average power radiation in every IR atmospheric transmission window of interest and therefore, it has the potential to provide efficacious countermeasures for high value, high signature platforms, which presently have only very limited protection. The novel source is based on the interaction of a beat wave with non-linear media. The beat wave is formed from the mixing of two carbon dioxide laser beams with closely spaced wavelengths, such as 9.5 and 9.6 microns. The studies by LET Corporation, as well as the original studies of the IR source are based on the supposition that the beat wave is formed by two distinct carbon dioxide lasers that provide two closely spaced wavelengths. Since the weight, size and cost of the driver exceed, by far, the weight, size and cost of any other component of the IR source, replacing the two carbon dioxide lasers with a single laser would substantially reduce the weight, size and cost of the system. A scheme is proposed that has the potential to produced two closely spaced wavelengths from a single carbon dioxide laser line. The scheme is based on the modulation instability, which is a general characteristic of many dispersive, non-linear media.",

Specifically, we have plasma-sprayed: (1) Lithium-compatible cathode materials (LiCoO2) for batteries, and (2) Selective emitter materials (rare-earth oxides) which retain the correct crystal structure and operate at high temperature up to 1700 K. The plasma-spray process is readily transitioned to the production environment; our existing plasma-spray equipment is the same equipment as used in production facilities. We propose to deposit cathode and anode materials in Phase I and to characterize their morphologies to demonstrate that the thermal spray process is a feasible approach to manufacturing thin components for thermal batteries. We will also develop a preliminary battery design, estimate performance benefits, and estimate production costs. Optional activities include testing sample cells. In Phase II we will complete the battery design and build working prototypes.",

It is therefore desirable to have a computer program that can support development of new vehicle models with a flexible database of often-used subsystems.

Research will investigate the feasibility of 1) developing specialized compiler technology to extract required TPS data, 3) mapping Unit-Under-Test (UUT) input/output (I/O) pin data from one ATS to another, and 4) mapping I/O data to ATS interfaces whose standards are in flux. Research will also investigate methods and formats for outputting data to Computer- Aided Design (CAD) software to automatically design an ICD for the target ATS. Our Phase I research goal will be to define requirements for a prototype software that may be productized under Phase II to support the rapid rehost of TPSs from one ATS to another. The prototype will be demonstrated using TPSs to be rehosted from a legacy Army ATS to the Integrated Family of Test Equipment (IFTE).  BENEFITS:  Successful results of this research will benefit and promise savings to the DOD, aviation maintainers, automotive electronics diagnosticians, and commercial electronics manufacturers vendors who test, repair, and",

        "abstract": "Not Available  The U.S. Navy dependence on GPS continues to increase, making it imperative to protect the GPS signals from radio frequency interference (RFI). Spatial nulling by CRPA systems is very effective at countering these RFIs, however, current CRPA systems are large and expensive, therefore unsuitable for current and future airborne platforms. The present SBIR Phase I proposal addresses this Navy requirement and proposes a Small Tactical L1/L2 CRPA (equivalent to 5  diameter circular array) Antenna Array and Electronic Control (STAEC) employing spatial-temporal processing architecture that provides cost-effective anti-jam capabilities. The small antenna array and digital antenna electronics design derives its legacy from a proven Mayflower GPS adaptive antenna solution. The proposed STAEC solution employs a novel signal processing approach that is effective against wideband jammers and aircraft multipath. The Phase I research will include modeling and simulation of the antenna array, as well as prototype antenna array measurements in anechoic chambers to demonstrate the performance of the small array by generating measured data of key system elements. The Phase II program will design, fabricate and demonstrate a prototype STAEC unit consisting of the small array and the digital beamforming/nulling electronics. The cost goals for the STAEC unit will be validated in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  ALPHATECH and Atlantic Aerospace propose to study the use of numerical optimization in the antenna design process. Such a study requires not only trying optimization algorithms on design problems, but also a detailed understanding of the underlying issues involved in choosing an algorithm. When deciding if a particular algorithm is effective for antenna design, it is important that it not be judged as a  black box . That is, it should not be evaluated based only upon the final solution and rate of convergence, but it is also important to judge the suitability of the algorithm for its utility in the overall design process. It is the objective of this effort to identify optimization algorithms that are suitable for antenna design in a more general, interactive optimization-based design environment that allows the designer to explore tradeoffs between design requirements. The phase I effort will produce a survey of optimization algorithms with respect to the antenna design problem as well as a prototype of a generic optimization interface to the numerical electromagnetic code (NEC). The performance of several optimization algorithm implementations will be characterized using realistic antenna design problems.",

Aculight proposes to apply its unique laser packaging of diode pumped solid state lasers and engineered nonlinear optics to show feasibility of eye safe sources that meet the cost, size, efficiency and reliability requirements of Army laser radar for munitions. The University of New Mexico (UMM) will support Aculight in this work by defining the best solid state Raman converter to be compared with periodically poled OPOs. Because Aculight and UNM have worked extensively in these fields, and have hardware resources available, the Phase I work can move beyond the design stage with laboratory measurements to directly compare these alternative approaches.

The HBC will operated in the 105 to 1.7 micron region of the spectrum and will obtain high coupling efficiency with the lasers.  The HBC will be small, lightweight optical element and it will be inexpensive. The fabrication of the HBC is based on the storage of multiple holographic gratings in the same spatial location.  Until now, this has been difficult and inefficient due to material issues.  With the advent of polymer with diffusion amplification, PDA, multiple holographic gratings can be efficiently stored in a single location on a holographic plate.  Using a large dynamic range, this material can combine 20 holograms with a combined output that has more than 90% of the combined input power.  This is the key advantage of this particular holographic material over others. For the purposes of this proposal, information from several different laser beams will be multiplexed as holograms in the PDA material.  These multiplexed holograms can then work to redirect or combine the output from the laser beams of the ladar system simultaneously, thereby forming a single, high energy beam.

The size of MEMS devices will enable integrating these with microelectronics to do a variety of sensing and actuation functions to produce a variety of useful devices that can be mass-produced at low cost. Several studies have projected MEMS market size in tens of billions of dollars by the turn of the century. Although a variety of MEMS devices have been demonstrated, a major limitation is the failure due to wear and stiction (permanent adhesion) of the micro moving parts. Surmet proposes to develop a coating based on its UltraC coating for MEMS devices to prolong the device life and increase their reliability. In Phase I, fabrication of MEMS, deposition of coatings and thorough microstructural and reliability characterization will demonstrate feasibility of the proposed approach. In Phase II, several devices of military and commercial interest will be selected for development. Coating process and properties will be optimized and extensive characterization will be conducted to establish reliability. In Phase III the technology will be transferred to DoD and commercial MEMS producers.",

Devices with and without this L-VPE layer will be fabricated and their performance as a function of area will be determined. The proposed program will accelerate the insertion of SiC devices into DoD, utility, automotive, and industrial power applications.

However, it has opened new avenues for malicious attacks by adversaries.  Information security research efforts have concentrated on devising host, network or system level defensive mechanisms that can either prevent, or detect and eliminate such attacks so that system impacts are minimized.  However, a decision tool that considers the cost and performance degradations of defensive mechanisms, and that recognizes resource constraints of both parties, should assist deployment of defensive strategies.  Moreover, an effective representation of the defense situation in the face of ongoing and potential assaults and deployed countermeasures will help the security manager to identify the need for improvement of system security.  We propose to develop a game theory based software tool that provides an effective representation of the current and expected nature of future security situation of an enterprise system.

This is because components fabricated from plate steel are inherently more precise and of lower weight than those produced from traditional rolled steel. A major requirement is the need for automatic categorization, nesting, and handling of steel plate used in fabricating structural shapes (i.e. I-beams, T-beams). The key issue underlying this capability is that the flow of raw materials through the cutting and welding process requires management of many components to create an optimized delivery of end product (fabricated parts) with minimal material waste and labor expense. Development of an Optimized Structural Component Assembly Manager (OSCAM) is proposed. The proposed approach will create a modular system compatible with emerging CAD standards, commercial cutting and welding systems, and suitable for adaptation to various manufacturing requirements, with emphasis on shipbuilding.

The addition of boron nitride (BN) powder to a high thermal conductivity pitch carbon fiber laminate dramatically increases the transverse thermal conductivity.  In the past the usefulness of pitch carbon fiber laminates has been limited by the low transverse conductivity.  The increase in conductivity will dramatically increase the number of applications where this composite can be used for example: heatsinks, thermal radiators and missile structures.  It is predicted that high thermal conductivity laminates will be able to replace structures that have traditionally been fabricated from aluminum beryllium for lower cost and weight. Prior experimentation carried out with EPSCoR funding has shown that thermal conductivity increases as the concentration of BN is increased, but also the strength of the laminate decreases.  The technical objective of this project is to fabricate laminates with increasing concentrations of BN and measure the thermal conductivity and corresponding strength and stiffness.  Data and design tables will be produced to enable engineers to accurately predict the performance of structures where the thermal conductivity of a pitch laminate has been enhanced by the addition of BN.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  A new approach for fabricating high performance low temperature regenerators for use in advanced cryocoolers near and below 10K is proposed. Solid regenerator cartridges with microchannel structure (MCS) made of magnetic lanthanide-rich materials (e.g. Er(sub 3)Ni) are suggested instead of traditional regenerator beds packed with spheres. A regenerator cartridge with a microchannel structure offers the best design for cryocoolers because it has the highest ratio of heat transfer area to pressure drop. Its effectiveness is 20 to 25% higher than that of regenerator beds packed with spheres. Lack of technology for fabricating regenerators with microchannel structures from brittle magnetic intermetallics have prevented their use in the past. This project deals with a novel patented fabrication technique for making multichannel regenerators from brittle intermetallic compound Er(Sub 3)Ni, which exhibits sharp rise in heat capacity at temperatures slightly below 10K. The fabrication technique includes the co-extrusion of fine Er(sub 3)Ni powders together with a polymer binder and filler. It offers a possibility to fabricate cryocooler regenerator cartridges from brittle magnetic intermetallics with a controlled surface area and a low fluid flow resistance. The mechanical stability of MCS regenerators is expected to be much better than that of the beds packed with spherical particles. It is anticipated that the cost of manufacture using the MCS technology will be significantly lower because of much higher yields.",

Although recently developed technologies and systems address this issue, a large number of legacy systems and applications are still in use throughout DoD that are neither inherently collaborative nor easily reusable within collaborative environments. A need, therefore, exists to bring these existing systems and applications into the collaborative environment. The effort proposed here addresses this need by utilizing the Collaborative Enterprise Environment (CEE), currently under development by AFRL, as a platform for extending Advanced Khoros, a powerful software development environment and suite of tools for image and signal processing that has been widely used for the development of DoD M&S applications. The result will be a version of Advanced Khoros that supports collaborative development and component reuse. Key technologies that will make this effort possible include CORBA, the Khoros workspace compiler, and Java. The resulting system, which we call the Visual Interactive Programming for Enterprise Research, or VIPER, will allow Advanced Khoros development tools to operate within a multi-platform collaborative environment and enable existing legacy systems to be used with this environment.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  A key problem with the Internet is the slowness with which the underlying IP protocol can evolve. Though this protocol is very successful, there are many things for which it is not well suited, and a variety of efforts have been initiated to revise the standard to address these shortcomings. About four years ago the Defense Advanced Projects Agency (DARPA) launched an ambitious program to develop a technology, known generally as Active Networking (AN), intended to address this problem of slow deployment. An active network is one in which the routers can be customized to run communication- oriented protocols on a per-user, per-flow, or even per-packet basis. In particular, users are allowed to deploy or invoke programs within the network rather than just at endpoints. This allows a range of new protocols to be deployed quickly within the network by programming them using a more high-level interface. The goal of this proposal is to take steps to commercialize one of the most successful and widely-used active network technologies, and take a first step toward developing applications based on that technology through an experiment on the ABONE. The basic technology is that of PLAN, the Packet Language for Active Networks, designed by the SwitchWare Project at the University of Pennsylvania. The application is endpoint emulation, a service in which an active router serves as a proxy for a destination that becomes temporarily inaccessible. Such a service would allow certain kinds of communication between two endpoints even if they were never connected to one another at the same time due to erratic network connectivity or the unavailability of the endpoints themselves. The resulting service is much more general than an  answering-machine  since it does not require designation of specific proxy to hold the message.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project demonstrates a breakthrough approach to very high-speed, high-resolution A/D conversion which improves the speed by up to six times the state-of-the-art by using a parallel array of individual converters. The significant performance improvements afforded by the Advanced Filter Bank Analog-to-Digital Converter (AFB ADC) architecture will be demonstrated in Phase I by building and testing a pre-prototype breadboard implementation of the front-end electronics of a 14-bit AFB ADC system with 260 MHz sample rate (four times the speed of state-of-the-art). A faster, single chip 14-bit AFB ADC with 390 MHz sample rate will be developed in Phase II. V Company and Raytheon E-Systems in Falls Church, VA have formed a strategic alliance to collaborate on this project. The architecture works because the filter bank signal processing significantly reduces the sensitivity to analog mismatches (e.g., phase distortion, clock skew, temperature drift) which prohibit existing parallel conversion methods (e.g., Time-Interleaving) from achieving high resolution. V Company has proven the technical efficacy of the concept by successfully building and testing breadboard circuitry with 12-bit resolution and 80 MHz sample rate. The AFB ADC architecture will always exceed the state-of-the-art because it can easily be upgraded as new, more powerful ADC products become available. The architecture is amenable to single-chip integration for compact, low-power applications.",

The currently used fluid, Isopar L, poses two environmental hazards, the first to humans during the filling operation, and the second to the marine environment as a result of accidental leakage. In this Phase I program, Foster-Miller proposes to identify an inherently more environmentally friendly fill fluid using a computer model based on group contribution theory. The five most promising candidates will then be tested in the laboratory for key physical, chemical, and environmental properties. After identifying a new fill fluid, Foster-Miller will then develop one or more innovative additives for the fill fluid that will minimize the environmental impact of a leak or spill in the marine environment. These additives will create a fill fluid system that is self-remediating, making the fluid non-persistent. At the conclusion of the Phase I program with Option, a new fluid will have been identified and several concepts for self-remediation will have been surveyed for further development. In the Phase II program, the development and optimization of the self-remediating additives will be performed.",

One innovation in our approach to this problem over other highly successful approaches lies in our plan to extend the use of the contour tree approach to aid feature-identification tasks as well as point-based searches; we believe that a heuristic can be designed which relies heavily on the structure of the tree itself as a launch-point for feature identification algorithms. Other innovations lie in the addition of convex-hull algorithms to determine where concavities lie in contours (these are key for identifying important features such as canyons), and in our proposal of methods to handle serious interpretation problems which can arise as artifacts of the map boundary (such as mistaking canyons for depressions). Other techniques, such as contour decimation, are proposed in order to speed up more time-consuming processing tasks. Vexcel's unique contribution to this effort lies also in our understanding of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (IFSAR) data, and in our experience with building commercially viable systems for processing and extracting map features from remotely sensed data.

A particularly critical requirement is for rocket propellants with higher performance than state-of-the-art materials.

It is known that the difluoramino group is superior to other common oxidizing functional groups as a source of combustion energy in combination with hydrocarbon or metallic fuels.  With boron-based fuels, BOF is formed, which is non-condensable.  The elimination of two-phase flow losses can result in 3-4% increase in performance.  It has been difficult, however, to devise synthetic schemes for the preparation of propellant ingredients containing difluoramino groups that have sufficient overall content of oxidizing groups to meet formulation requirements.  Under the proposed program, a little-studied method for the preparation of compounds with difluoramino and nitro groups will be elaborated for the synthesis of practical propellant ingredients.  The overall simplicity of the approach means that useful target compounds can potentially be attained at substantially lower cost than those using methods currently under intensive study",

As chips are brought closer together, the area/volume power densities and, therefore, heat increases.  MS Technology (MST) proposes a new type of heat removal modular device, which will solve electronic packaging problems of future large scale device electronic and optoelectronics systems, like MCMs. This new approach removes the generated heat by first converting it to electricity which could be dissipated in a shunt resistor far from the device or supplement the main system power supply.

MST will conduct proof of concept demonstrations to indicate the practicality of such techniques for use in device electronic systems.  A low cost high performance heat removal modular device, will find commercial application in projects of interest to government, industry and academia, especially with respect to commercial applications.

The algorithm we propose is conceptually founded on wavelet techniques. We will take advantage of the fact that the wavelet representation of the IR spectrum offers greater flexibility in enhancing low signal-to-noise ratios because the wavelet naturally resolves noise and spectral features into different domains. The algorithm itself is based on work described in Ref. [1], where an advanced wavelet technique is used to denoise astronomical spectra and remarkably recovers weak signal features that are drowned in noise so as not to be seen in the spectrum. In addition, the FTIR application of remote sensing is generally performed in a nonlinear environment due to dynamic background and instrumentation fluctuations. We propose the testing of wavelet pattern classification algorithms to aid in the identification of chemical compounds in this environment. In Phase II, algorithms, techniques, and procedures developed and demonstrated during Phase I will be optimized, implemented, and tested on a computer platform that runs ORINCON's commercial, real-time signal processing software.

These advanced composite structures are used on ship board for superstructures and hulls, as well as for primary structure on naval aircraft. These materials provide high strength to weight ratios and signature reduction as long as no critical defects are present. Speckle interferometry, using the shearography method, has been successfully used for these inspections. The TQS proposed system will incorporate advances in the technology that will provide the capabilities desired, with a direct route to commercialization.",

Initial research directions will explore utilization of per pixel parallel buffers that will modify simulation calculated pixels for intensity, position offsets and warping prior to the digital information being output to the digital display device. Rapid prototyping of control algorithms will leverage an existing low-cost testbed with COTS multiple graphics board which currently implements 4 digital buffers to produce full screen anti-aliasing. Research will include investigation of algorithms from simple linear transforms to innovative concepts using Condition Logic, Neural Network and Genetic algorithms. It is envisioned that the more advanced algorithms can be utilized as initialization functions (i.e., learning modes) in an automated methodology similar to the auto convergence features on existing CRT projectors. Critical requirements will be driven by Human Factors and Human sensor limits so as to  right size  the effective adjustments, for digital displays including helmet-mounted. Further, the reuse of this technology may have direct benefits for related research.

The instrument performs the measurement using a single pulse of light and can therefore, freeze the motion of the blade. This instrument can be used to identify the mode shape of operating compressor blades and therefore determine strain due to vibratory excitation. High cycle fatigue due to resonantly excited vibrations is a leading cause of failure in aircraft and power plant turbines. This information can be used to study prototype engine components as well as to monitor the health of operating machinery. During Phase I we will analyze several opto-mechanical designs, select the most appropriate, construct a breadboard, and demonstrate ultra-fast profilometry measurements. Careful attention is placed on developing a robust system that can operate under the harsh thermal and vibratory conditions of an operating turbine. We will work closely with engineers at a leading engine manufacture to develop a prototype design commensurate with the industry's measurements needs and compatible with existing engine access constraints. In Phase II a full scale probe will be constructed and demonstrated on an actual operating engine.",

The new single-frequency approach addresses improved bandwidth efficiency and adds both a secure and a non-secure orderwire mode. The new modem will result in an order of magnitude increase in HF link capacity permitting a more efficient integration of HF radio links into a broad range of backbone networks, such as TCP/IP, ATM, or X.25. The serial-tone waveform will allow much more efficient use of HF power amplifiers. The modem will also be designed to be resistant to narrowband interference and impulse noise.

The problems associated with finding a good model are exacerbated by changing battlefield conditions such as weather effects and small changes in the target's appearance such as material or personnel. We propose a means of reconstruction of three-dimensional information using Motion vision (Motion vision reconstructs three dimensional structure from an image sequence recording object or camera motion). Images from standard cameras will be used to create and modify target models. These sensors will also compare current images to known models, finding the closest fit. This Phase I effort will review and evaluate the technology alternatives for implementing this dynamic set of models, and will define a system for performing automated model recovery from image streams to standard 3D representation formats such as VRML. This process will substantially speed the creation and update of dynamic knowledgebases for rapid access and update in ATR applications.

The PIE component will be easily portable to new event types. The TTG component will provide summaries of the results of information extraction, using COTS machine translation for extracted phrases.

The same camera can also delete obvious regions of no interest before imagery is input into the target recognition system. The desired on-board processing speed is achieved by utilizing a CMOS Pulse Coupled Neural Network (PCNN). The PCNN is selected for this high-speed camera for three reasons. First, this team has demonstrated that the PCNN segments imagery significantly better than thresholding methods. Secondly, a PCNN based target detection algorithm that identifies and deletes regions of no interest has been developed in prior work. Finally, SY Technology is fabricating a high speed CMOS PCNN chips for medical applications. Phase I will optimize a PCNN based algorithm to identify ROT in imagery. A camera of 512 x 512 pixels with 8-bit readout will be simulated/validated. Simulations will focus on speed, reliability and size. m e final design of the smart camera, processing > 60 fps, will be delivered. Option I proposes to fabricate a prototype.

These services will improve the user control over the processing of the embedded applications while at the same time reducing the cost and effort in building or integrating new software.

However, it is superior to those methods because (1) it isolates applications from one another more effectively and (2) it gives control over the sharing of information to the user rather than to software designers. This approach does not compete with object broker implementations but rather it builds on those techniques to further insulate applications from each other's construction details. In this approach, applications share information from other parts of the system as directed by the user and managed by advanced services provided in the user interface.

The information age has vastly increased the number of data sources while at the same time compressing the time available for making decisions.  More the data sources, greater the uncertainty in the accuracy of the decision since any one of the data sources could be erroneous.  Thus there is a greater risk that the commander (user) would make a wrong decision.  In fact, assessing the risk involved in the decisionmakeing process is an important component of decision support.  We adapt a technique, called Value-at-Risk (VAR), developed by the financial services community for risk-based decision-making.  We propose a new approach for real-time computation and interactive display of  VAR.  The approach uses a Monte Carlo method for training a neural network using historical patterns of risk factors.  We choose a particular scenario of the information warfare problem as our  initial application domain.  We propose to demonstrate a software prototype of this decision support system at the end of Phase I.  Further, we propose a four-month option effort for demonstration the approach to potential DOD and private sector clients, and thereafter refining the approach and implementation to facilitate commercialization.BENEFITS: A software product/service for risk-based decision support aimed at information securtiy applications is expected.",

The overwhelming complexity and high rigidity of present systems stems from their underlying architectures (or lack thereof), which are ill equipped to accommodate changes in scale.

Fractal scalable systems will have constant perceived complexity (from the viewpoint of users and developers) while providing support for increased complexity and growth.  Dynamic adaptation provides numerous benefits to software systems and leads to a new development paradigm where applications are fluidly assembled, modified and enhances at runtime.  This paradigm is based on interoperable components that can be manipulated visually (or using other intuitive assembly metaphors) within running applications.  The paradigm also provides implicit support for workflow-based processing at the application level; components can be shared among widely distributed systems, and applications are seamlessly transported between end users and create on the fly.

Current sonar systems, including those based on dolphin echolocation characteristics, exploit a single-point receiver.  Even when arrays of receivers are used in extant sonars, their function is to increase the beam forming precision or to steer the sonar beam.  Dolphins, in contrast, appear to use their two ears somewhat separable.  Binaural processing adds significant information about the structure of the target in both time and frequency-domain representations of the signal.  Studies with speech signals indicate a 5dB performance gain when using two receivers, relative to a single receiver.  Similar improvements can be expected in the proposed biomimeteic sonar.  To test this model, we will construct a binaural data-acquisition system capable of precise positioning and able to move freely in three dimensions as dolphins do when searching for fish.  We will collect echoes from mine-like targets placed on a relatively clutter free sandy ocean bottom, and buried under the substrate and we will compare the performance of this system with current biomimetic monaural systems.",

In particular, improved range and cross-range resolution and new beam capabilities would be made possible with a wideband true-time-delay antenna feed. Several new techniques, such as fiber-optic feeds, offer excellent delay-line performance with the advantages of size, weight, bandwidth, propagation loss, immunity to electro-magnetic interference, and channel isolation. The packaging issues related to fiber-based delay lines, however, are complicated and costly. A guided-wave antenna feed in another form could offer the desirable attributes of fiber-based antenna feeds with simplified packaging and greater compactness. In this program Radiant Research, Inc. proposes a novel three-dimensionally integrated polymer-waveguide-based high-packing-density structure to cover all the advantages provided by optical-fiber arrays, while further reducing the system size and eliminating the complicated optoelectronic packaging problems associated with optical-fiber-based delay lines. Five-bit optical-delay lines of up to 10 meters can be fabricated using a 5 cm by 5 cm plate housing three-layers of polymeric waveguides, which have corresponding time delays of 1 ps to 50 ns. The resulting antenna system will possess the features oflow cost, wide coverage, flexible frequency change, multiple-link capability.",

The approach is to develop a new conducting buffer layer which we have identified as an excellent template for YBCO growth.  This particular buffer composition should allow the growth of an extremely thin, compatible oxide layer which should enhance the deposition of the YBCO.  These buffer materials have substantial advantages over conventional oxide buffer layers, including high strength, toughness, electrical and thermal conductivity.  The purpose of this Phase I investigation is to develop buffer layers which promote improved YBCO growth, resulting in higher critical currents.  The Phase I effort will involve growth of textured buffer layers on biaxially-textured Ni substrates.  Additionally, the in-situ growth of thin intermediate stabilization layers between the buffer and YBCO films will be pursued.  Suitably thick YBCO layers (up to a micron) will be overgrown on buffer-coated Ni tapes using pulsed laser deposition.  Material characterization of the buffer and YBCO layers will be done using x-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy.

        "abstract": "Not Available  The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of an innovative design that combines centrifugal separation, cross-flow filtration (CFF), Dean flow surface cleaning, and back-flush techniques into an effective micro-filtration unit. The centrifugal separation is effective in separating debris which has higher specific gravity than that of the DFM for particles as small as 20 microns. CFF is especially effective for feed flow with colloidal solids. Unlike dead-end filtration, the surface dynamics of CFF does not make gelatinous colloidal solids (which often get carried into fuel oil by seawater) extrude through filter pores, and thus does not compromise the performance of filtration. CFF makes use of the shear force parallel to the filter medium to reduce the cake formation on the filter surface. Dean flow is a secondary flow created in a curved flow passage. The resulting flow profile takes the form of a toroidal vortex. The vortex profile generates a high shear rate which acts to transport material such as colloidal solids and fine silts away from the membrane surface. The combination of these features with an automatic back-flushing device forms a compact, self-cleaning, and continuously operable unit suitable for pre-filtration in Navy shipboard fuel oil systems.",

These varying loads have brought about the concept of the Thermal Storage Unit (TSU). The TSU is added to the cooling system to average the heat load on the cryocooler. By averaging the load, the size of the cryocooler and the cooler input power are minimized while the sensor temperature is held constant. To date, development work has concentrated on fixed temperature TSUs. Fixed temperature TSUs work by absorbing heat by the mechanism of phase change in a solid cryogen located at the cooled sensor. Variable temperature TSUs have been studied very little. Variable temperature TSUs solve the variable heat load problem without the need for phase-change cryogens. They are particularly useful for very low temperature applications (below 12K) where there are no phase-change cryogens useful for TSUs. This proposed effort will examine variable temperature TSUs through analysis and test with concentration on the temperature range below 12K.",

Specifically, JAMCORP proposes to develop manufacturing methods for producing LBM with densities less than 50% that of the bulk alloy.  Lattice Block Materials are a new class of materials which make use of the well understood principles of trusses and space frames.  These principles are applied at a size previously thought to be impractical for manufacturing.  JAMCORP has successfully developed and demonstrated a manufacturing process to produce components having unusually high strength to weight ratios.  The physical properties of LBM, such as temperature resistance and hardness, closely reflect the physical properties of the parent material whether it be a metal, an alloy, or a polymer.  Cost-effective LBM manufacturing will enable significant reductions in structural component weight.  Analysis indicates that hundreds to thousands of pounds could be eliminated from military and commercial naval craft if LBMs were used to replace solid structural components.  Weight reductions directly increase maneuverability, range, and fuel efficiency.",

Novel algorithms for the harsh shallow water acoustic environment are needed since the threat model for the ASW has shifted from deep to shallow water. Recent efforts by the underwater community have identified the advantages of using broadband signals and new processing techniques to limit the effects of reverberation. This effort proposes an unconventional approach that exploits the broadband nature of explosive or impulse-like sources, as well as the new generation of coherent broadband acoustic sources the Navy uses. This broadband approach achieves very good array gain and dynamic range using a limited number of sensors. This technique uses degrees of freedom in the frequency domain, by drawing an analogy with degrees of freedom in space in a discrete line-array. The algorithms being proposed include broadband adaptive filtering, beam canceling and modified eigen-vector beamforming techniques. These algorithms are used to feed a broadband classifier based on a time/frequency wavelet analysis, and are expected to enhance the performance of future ASW systems operating in high clutter environments.",

A revolutionary approach is required. PMS-429 has taken a bold step in developing the ERGM round.  It meets the formal range, accuracy and flyout time requirements nicely.  The estimated cost, however, is larger than desired.  In this proposal, the JDI Team has taken a different approach, called HYPA (High Performance Affordable) Munitions.  We have deliberately removed the major high cost components of the designs which incorporate GPS/IMU guidance for accuracy and lifting surfaces for range.  We then strive to get the best performance we can at a very low cost through a combination of clever design approaches and newly available technologies.  We believe that we can achieve ranges similar to those of ERGM and other guiding and lifting designs, with a cost on the order of a factor of 5-10 less, a flyout time much faster, and an accuracy on the order of 100 meters.  The objectives of Phase I are to conduct a concept formulation study, assess the commercial potential of HYPA technologies and concepts, and develop a long range demonstration plan to be implemented in any follow-on phase.",

Splotting is a process of capturing orthographic geo-specific  imagery  of a geo-typical terrain database, then creating a clip mapped texture of that imagery to be mapped to a terrain contour. Through this technique high resolution textures can be inserted into the clip stack of a run-time database to provide high resolution geo-specific imagery with an optimized geometry (reduced polygons). By utilizing this technique, the appearance of textured terrain can be improved dramatically while improving the throughput of the rendering system. This approach overcomes many of the deficiencies associated with image resolution and source data.

If this class of target-like clutter can be accurately defined for a given ATR application and precomputed, then the false alarm rate for that application can be significantly reduced and throughput rate increased. In particular, the classifier's decision surface can be crafted much more accurately through the use of negative training examples (training samples labeled  non-target ). The first step of our proposed approach is to cluster all clutter in a self-organized manner using a hierarchical Adaptive Resonance Theory neural network. Self-organization is critical since only an unbiased analysis across the full clutter space will allow us to uncover all potential target-like clutter clusters. The second step is to analyze each cluster using the statistical classification technique known as Support Vector Machines to choose members from the clutter categories to use as negative training examples for the ATR's own classifier. This approach enables automatic selection of the members ( support vectors ) closest to the target category in feature space, those members most likely to cause false alarms. The approach will be evaluated on in-house developed ATR algorithms.",

Material defects and impurities in currently available material limit laser power, total spectral range, efficiency, and produce absorption bands. Spire proposes to develop superior quality material by deposition of homoepitaxial films by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) using a variable pressure reactor and high purity sources with low cracking temperatures and high vapor pressures. New materials and techniques are expected to give greatly improved results and low defect material. In Phase II, in-situ diagnostics using multiple wavelength ellipsometry will give optimal compositional control further reducing defect density and giving material with properties superior to bulk grown crystals, analogous to homoepitaxial GaAs films on GaAs substrates. Reduced absorption and increased laser damage thresholds are expected.",

A better approach would be to remove most of the heat directly from the entire surface of the die via an efficient heat spreader. Diamond has the highest thermal conductivity of all materials, but single crystal diamond is much too expensive for use with microprocessor chips, which are from 5 to 15 mm square. Vapor deposited diamond is also too expensive in any grade having high thermal conductivity. An advanced polycrystalline diamond ceramic material exhibiting thermal conductivity approaching that of single crystal diamond can be made inexpensively in thick pieces to near net shape at ultra-high pressures and high temperatures. This proposal envisions manufacture of a novel polycrystalline diamond heat spreader which will efficiently couple the entire surface of the die to all metal planes in the motherboard and optionally to an external heat spreader on the back plane. Board assembly is facilitated via a straightforward adaptation of present Tape Carrier Package technology. Phase I goal is to demonstrate cool operation of a high performance desktop Pentium processor  hot chip  in a convection-cooled motherboard.",

Unfortunately, these modifications bring along severe restrictions on vehicle handling as well as increased maintenance requirements, neither of which is acceptable for the new generation of small, low-cost, AUVs. Recent advances in polymer-electrolyte and all-solid-electrolyte lithium ion cells open the possibility of pressure-tolerant batteries, i.e., batteries that are intrinsically capable of withstanding the pressure with negligible modification. In this proposal we will demonstrate how such pressure-tolerant batteries can increase an AUV's energy capacity by 50% or more, with no reduction in vehicle payload and no increase in vehicle size. To get a corresponding increase in capacity through better electrochemistry or cell manufacturing would require many millions of dollars and many years of R&D effort, with no guarantee of success. For this Phase I effort we propose to perform the key tests required to demonstrate the feasibility of such pressure-tolerant batteries.",

Yet, there is a general reluctance on the part of industry to employ these techniques in safety-critical production applications. Although many valid reasons exist, a primary source of resistance is the requirement that industry end-users abandon familiar design and certification practices to achieve safety and performance benefits for flight conditions that are rarely encountered (e.g., failures). The proposed work addresses many of the challenges associated with retrofitting existing flight control systems to provide engineers with an ability to compensate for airframe damage, sensor and actuator failures, effector impairments, and dangerous unmodeled dynamics. The approach leverages recent algorithmic advances in system identification, statistical change detection, and model validation to yield a simple (from the user's perspective) add-on system module that provides adaptation to the baseline controller only during a failure. To fully exploit the opportunity, a prototype software tool is envisioned that will allow automated development of custom add-on reconfiguration modules.",

The identification of antibodies to various bacteria is allowing an advance in immunoassay technology.  Many new test kits are emerging for testing in clinical and food applications. Another emerging technique for biological analysis is capillary electrophoresis. This analytical tool has been used to separate and identify proteins, drugs, viruses, nucleotides, and other biochemical species. By combining the advantages of immunoassays and capillary electrophoresis, new analytical techniques can be developed with synergistic capabilities for the rapid separation, isolation, and analysis of bacteria. Once the technique is optimized, small portable instruments will be designed for field-deployable applications.

(ITT) , proposes to develop an innovative compact and high power infrared LIDAR system for the standoff detection and discrimination of biological aerosols at ranges approaching 10 km.  Our approach anticipates the use of the signal (~l.55 um) and idler (~3.45 pm) wavelengths from a solid state optical parametric oscillator (OPO) transmitter to provide a ratio of returns which is unique to biological aerosols and clearly differentiable from normal aerosol backgrounds, thereby performing the discrimination task.  This approach may be extended through the use of wavelength tuning in the signal channel to detect the chemical signature of growth media which are co-distributed in the agent containing aerosol.  The key innovation in the development of the LIDAR is in the configuration of the OPO cavity, which resonates on the idler and only extracts the signal on the last pass through the cavity.  Consequently, the output of the device tends to follow the beam quality of the pump device -providing low divergence with good beam profile which enhances conversion efficiency.  The effort also addresses key uncertainties in the magnitudes of aerosol backscatter coefficients which are key to bio-agent discrimination. BENEFITS:  The anticipated result of a combined Phase I and Phase II effort is the development and delivery of a novel OPO-based LIDAR capable of discriminating bio-aerosols",

        "abstract": "Not Available  LifeCell has developed a patented system for the long-term preservation of platelets utilizing the biochemical stabilization of specific second messenger pathways critical to the platelet physiology. The stabilization formulation, ThromboSol(tm) modulates the endogenous platelet pathways that lead to cellular activation. This modulation renders the platelets capable of withstanding the rigors of cryopreservation in the absence of structural or biochemical damage. The platelet preservation system is logistically simple and yields high recovery of platelet number, morphology indices and in vitro and in viva functional activity. A feature of this cryopreservation system is the use of 2' DMSO. While this does represent a 3-fold reduction in the DMSO concentration as compared to the standard cryopreservation methods, it remains to be determined if this reduced amount of DMSO is directly transfusable of if so whether alternative agents more compatible with transfusion can be used. The goal of this platelet preservation program is to obtain a directly infusable formulation. Therefore, this proposal will identify alternative reagents which can mimic both the biochemical stabilization and cryoprotectant properties of DMSo. These reagents will be evaluated using in vitro assays, in conjunction with ThromboSol, to develop a platelet cryopreservation formula which' is directly transfusable and achieves high retention of platelet cell number and functional activity.

Unlike other conventional methods which first separate soot from the exhaust gas and then burn it by raising the temperature of the trapped soot, the proposed method uses properties of non-thermal plasma to generate free radicals to oxidize the soot directly in the exhaust gas. The potential of the approach for soot oxidation presented here stems from the fact that free radicals react with diesel particulates (soot) in a way normally associated with a very high temperature, much higher than the actual ignition temperature for these particulates. The free radicals will be generated in the exhaust gas containing soot. The proposed device will cause a minimal, if any, pressure drop in the exhaust stream; moreover, its only energy requirement is the relatively low average power supply to its magnetron. It is expected that this device will operate in a wide range of temperatures of the engine cycle, and will be maintenance free.",

The greatly improved selectivity of the proposed technology over the conventional IC-suppressed conductivity method, affords a simplified instrument capable of detecting ppb levels of perchlorate even in water samples containing much higher concentrations of interfering anions.

The algorithms developed here result in reduced training data support and computational requirements utilizing a priori information regarding the structure underlying the interference. Because these algorithms are based on interference consisting of a small number of strong low rank interferers plus white noise, they permit development of powerful data matrix-based methods that also offer potential for considerably reduced training data support and computational complexity. The algorithms afford the capability of a constant false alarm rate(CFAR) and permit the design of robust receiver structures. Performance analysis using realistic simulated data and real data from experiments using a UESA circular array is presented. Simulation techniques for data generation from an idealized circular array and a practical circular array, including relevant radar parameters, are developed. The algorithms resulting from this research permit rapid localization of dominant interference subspaces, enabling fast adaptation intervals which are fractions of a coherent processing interval(CPI). Consequently, these algorithms are suitable for use in severely non-homogeneous and nonstationary interference backgrounds. This work outlines the differences between uniform linear arrays and circular arrays and discusses the resulting impact on STAP signal processing.",

First, it requires at least one high-gain auxiliary channel (each such channel entails an independent, full gain, beamformer,) and second, the post-cancellation main-beam residues are normally too distorted to allow for a meaningful angle measurement capability. The mainbeam cancellation approach that we propose below obviates these difficulties. It utilizes an innovative beamforming technique that provides several major advantages. First, it enables the radar to steer the pattern difference nulls toward the jammer within the same dwell at which jamming is first detected, and to implement the steering more accurately than is possible via the antenna phase shifters. Second, it makes it possible to adaptively cancel jamming residues in the difference patterns using multiple available high gain channels, without incurring undue pattern distortions. Third, it enables target detection in the jamming sanitized difference channels. Fourth, it enables a measure of angle estimation based on difference channel ratios sanitized from jamming. And fifth, it accomplishes all of the above using only minor modifications to the conventional monopulse beamforming architecture, and increasing the number of receive channels by a modest amount.",

It is called the PDPA (Programmable Data Path Array) architecture and is characterized by the following features: specific support for data path functions, programming of logic elements in groups of 8, programming of routing switches in groups of 8, significant reduction of routing to logic ratio, architectural provisions for vector processing and pipelining, and provisions for context switching (logic and routing) through register files. The PDPA allows logic and routing resources to be programmed in groups having a size equal to the bus width, reducing the number of programming bits needed to implement user functions. This specialization also reduces the routing to logic ratio permitting more computational logic resources. Vector processing and switching of both logic and routing are naturally incorporated by storing the programmation in register files. Because of the tight data coupling between computing elements, we fully expect the PDPA to perform data path signal processing functions at clock speeds of 50 MHz.",

Standard practice for reducing the effects of these environments is to beef up the support structure or use acoustic blankets, both of which impose severe weight penalties. CSA Engineering proposes to develop active acoustic suppression technologies, which have the potential for good performance without the severe weight penalties, for application to high performance fighter aircraft. The suitability of the numerous acoustic suppression techniques will be performed for fighter electronics/weapons bays. Structural-acoustic simulations of these bays integrated with models of the host aircraft will be used to evaluate performance levels of these acoustic suppression designs. The predicted attenuation levels, and the physical practicality and modularity of the designs will be selected for further evaluation in a hardware demonstration. In the demonstration, a mockup of the electronics bay will be constructed and tested for acoustically induced vibration. The measured acoustic and vibration reduction with the acoustic suppression applied will provide an indication of levels of improvement that are realistically achievable.",

The development of the BASSD system is primarily based on the SMART layer technology which uses a built-in network of piezoelectric sensors and actuators to interrogate the condition of the structures. A Monitoring layer based on the AMART layer technology will be developed which will be made of a thin dielectric adhesive film with an embedded network of piezoelectric sensors and actuators. The monitoring layer could be surface-mounted or embedded inside composite structures. The BASSD system consists of three major components: a monitoring a smart suitcase, and application software. The smart suitcase hosts a sensor/actuator control unit as well as a laptop computer The software based on application to be implemented in the computer will be developed for the control unit to interface with the monitoring layer by a wired or by a wireless communication channel.  BENEFITS:  Upon completion of the development of the BASSD system, it could potentially provide the following advantages over to traditional NDE inspection techniques: *Convenience and Automation *Real Time Inspection *Reduction of Labor *Reduction of Down Time *Improvement of Reliability *Improvement of combat readiness",

        "abstract": "Not Available  When a parachute malfunctions, it is critical that the jumper deploy the reserve parachute quickly to ensure that the reserve canopy has adequate time to inflate and slow his descent. Minimum container opening altitudes above the ground for recreational skydivers are at least 2000 feet AGL, which affords the jumper enough time to determine his canopy status and activate the reserve if necessary. Skydiving students are required to use Automatic Activation Devices (AADs), however experienced skydivers do not use AADs because they are prohibitively expensive. Military combat and training jumps are often done from 500 feet AGL and there is very little time to determine whether a malfunction exists. Consequently, the use of an AAD is highly recommended since the jumpers reaction time may be inadequate to ensure a safe landing. There are commercially available AADs that can function in a military setting, however their use is cost prohibitive in a mass tactical setting. We propose to develop a cost effective AAD suitable for low altitude jumps that utilizes accelerometers and pressure sensors to determine the jumpers rate of descent, altitude and acceleration. By utilizing high performance low cost sensors, a reasonably priced device can be manufactured for military use.  BENEFITS:  The currently available AADs are very expensive: the Cypress 1-pin Expert sells for $1 175, the Astra l-pin Expert sells for $950 and the FXC 12000 sells for $875.

During Phase I of this project, one mediated unit will be developed and evaluated to determine its feasibility and use with young children in classroom settings.

The costs for paint repaint maintenance of aircraft range from ~$250,000 for a C-135 to ~$1 million for a C-5. Due to declining budgets, the Air Force expects that ~80% of the older aircraft will still be in the flight inventory to at least 2020. Aircraft replacement costs are on the order of $10 million to $100 million each. Therefore, there are strong incentives (and high payoff potential) to identify long-life coatings that provide high levels of protection so that the aircraft are not grounded prior to their desired retirement dates and, in addition, that significantly reduce the need for frequent painting/stripping/repainting and the associated maintenance costs. To meet this need a new durable primer system based on the combination of flexible epoxies and reactive fillers known as alumoxanes will be developed. The flexible epoxy primers will offer increased performance under adverse conditions in addition to greater service life. The flexible epoxies will be modified using tailored alumoxanes that will provide enhanced barrier properties, antioxidant protection and corrosion protection.",

Phase I effort will quantify the potential for substantial size/weight savings and/or performance improvement, relative to the state-of-the art technology, for EHD-enhanced air/liquid heat exchangers of interest to the AAAV program. Evaluation will capitalize on the proposers team's extensive technical know-how and experience with EHD-enhanced heat transfer and carbon-fiber composites and will employ a combination of computations and experiments to identify the best candidate(s) application for the AAAV program. Technical obstacles associated with using an EHD-enhanced carbon-fiber-composite heat exchanger for AAAV uses, such as corrosion and/or erosion and EHD-induced working fluid decomposition, electromagnetic interference, and power conditioning and/or requirement problems, will be studied. While Phase I will demonstrate the technology in laboratory-scale test modules, it will provide the design information for full scale testing of the heat exchanger in Phase II and commercialization of the technology in Phase III of the effort.",

The objectives of this program will be to 1) develop the formulation technology that permits control of electrical conductivity in the propellant over a wide temperature range, 2) measure the speed of ignition and extinguishment, 3) determine the electrical power required to ignite and control the propellant's burning properties and 4) measure the effect of voltage on thrust for small motor grains. Measurments will be made of the power required for ignition and at least two differing wire insulations will be tested to control the flux surface area during combustion. Tests will be made to demonstrate the control of propellant burning and motor thrust by varying the applied voltage.

        "abstract": "Not Available  Future naval combat systems will include wideband radars for high range resolution (HRR) target detection and discrimination functions. However, such functions in large arrays cannot be supported by conventional narrowband beamsteering techniques. TSC proposes a new approach to beamforming in which photonic wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technology is used to implement an affordable true time-delay (TTD)-assisted synthetic wideband (SWB) HRR radar receiver. SWB processing is a means of increasing the effective bandwidth of existing narrowband phased arrays through time-domain multiplexed radar waveforms. However, SWB alone poses severe technical challenges in radar resource allocation, dwell times, and overall accuracy. Full TTD beamforming, on the other hand, is intrinsically wideband but has proven prohibitively costly to implement on a large scale. By combining the two beamforming approaches, a HRR radar receiver will be developed requiring only partial TTD implementation to achieve performance comparable to a truly instantaneously wideband system. This will involve synthetic wideband processing to reduce the level of instantaneous bandwidth required for HRR, while implementing partial TTD to reduce the difficulties inherent in the SWB approach by effectively reducing the aperture size. Photonic WDM technology for partial TTD offers significant advantages in cost, performance and availability over other techniques.",

Currently, there exists an acute need to develop U.S. production capabilities for low cost, short pulse, high power millimeter-wave IMPATT diodes to meet the weapon system requirements. Silicon IMPATT diodes are capable of generating short pulse (100 ns typical), high power (40 - 50 watts) output power at W-band (75 - 110 GHz). However, the traditional suppliers of IMPATT diodes such as Hughes Aircraft Company and Raytheon Company are no longer producing the devices. QuinStar Technology has recently acquired from Hughes/Raytheon the license and equipment to produce and sell millimeter-wave IMPATT diodes. The proposed program will develop IMPATT diodes capable of high power (40 to 50 watt peak output power), short pulse (100 nanosecond) at W-band frequencies. This will serve as a vehicle to develop not only the enabling technology but also the US capability to produce high performance, low cost IMPATT diodes, both required for insertion into the existing systems and for the development of the next generation systems.",

KCI will select reinforcing fiber materials, design a composite from these fibers and our formulated pultrudable polyurethane, and perform finite element analysis to verify performance of the stanchion when exposed to critical design loading. KCI plans to investigate both conventional tubular stanchion configurations and other, more novel open section designs that would simplify tooling, ease process development and ultimately reduce production cost. Prototype polyurethane matrix parts will be pultruded and tested, and initial project ions of the production cost for the stanchion developed during Phase I.",

The Phase I program has the agressive goal to demonstrate and evaluate 2.5GHz modulation in a 1300nm VCSEL. Compatibility with Picolight driver circuitry will also be evaluated. Additionally, designs will be made for mil-spec-compliant, Gigabit-Ethernet-compliant, and reliable VCSELs for datacom in both multi- and single-mode packages. The Phase II program will develop commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) 1300nm VCSELs suitable for shipboard data links over distances at least 1km and at speeds and arrays at least 1x12 in size. The 1300nm VCSEL effort will be a materials development, and will be in concert with synergistic Picolight efforts in VCSEL design, packaging, driver/receiver circuits, and small-form-factor transceivers.",

Exciton's simulations and experiments support the synthesis of dyes with FWHM values of 4 nm. This value is one-half to one-fifth that previously observed. This value is also substantially less than the FWHM of reflection bands of rugates, holograms, or layered dielectrics because of the bandwidth requirements placed on such reflective technologies by the dimensions of the eye box. These new absorber dyes will also have absorption coefficients 2-5 times greater than those of current absorbers; therefore, proportionally lower dye concentrations will be required. As a result, processing and compatibility issues should be reduced and dye/host systems should demonstrate either a decrease in, or the absence of, interference from short wavelength bands. These dyes can be applied to both in-band and out-of-band solutions. Finally, eye protection incorporating these unusually narrow absorbers will have substantially less impact on color perception than either reflection or previous absorber technologies. Color balance may be within the human perceptual system's own adaptation range, or may be supplemented with only minor amounts of additional absorbers for critical color balance applications.",

Newer network applications require a minimum of T1 data rate (1.544 Mbps). The network must also be robust for the operating conditions of VSATs- small diameter dishes with inaccurate tracking and a cluttered terrain environment. Most commercial VSAT modems support data rates in the range of 64-128 kbps but those that do support higher data rates require significantly more transponder bandwidth and larger antenna sizes. CDMA is a perfect solution for VSATs where increased complexity and transponder bandwidth is not an option. Sigtek has identified the VSAT network market as a target ideal for the further development of our existing direct sequence modems. Using our CDMA technology, we can develop a CDMA network that solves these problems. Our existing hardware supports flexible spreading codes, variable data rates, and several types of FEC. Combined with further analysis and simulation we can develop the parameters for a VSAT network that solves many of these problems. Investigation of types of FEC, spreading codes, and interference reduction will be critical in achieving a Phase II deployment.",

It is suggested that high spatial and spectral coherence fiber lasers/amps are the enabling technology for practical arrays.

Moreover, phased arrays have proven to be challenging for semiconductor lasers. Phase I focuses on designing a sensor system and a matched optical phase control servo. The proposed system has similarities to radar, and provides a path to orbital-class detection ranges.

The Foster-Miller team provides an innovative seismic retrofit solution, noted expertise in event modeling and code revision and a clear path to cost-effective production. The resultant energy dissipation product will provide a viable alternative to the use of viscous dampers at a fraction of the cost. The proposed concept builds on a novel idea put forth for the Osaka convention center in Japan. Yielding diagonal frame members can be included in a new building, or added as a retrofit, to provide energy dissipation during a seismic event. Foster-Miller will develop a diagonal bracing system that will yield in both tension and compression to achieve energy dissipation. Hybrid carbon and fiberglass pultruded composite braces will be used to constrain buckling under compression loads while not adversely contributing to the axial stiffness. Foster-Miller will direct the program and provide expertise in design, modeling and implementation of novel composite structures. Fluor Daniel will support the assessment of performance and code requirements. McNamara/Salvia will provide seismic evaluation and design expertise.

Foster-Miler, Inc. will develop a new pressurized fuel filter restriction gauge (PFFRG) which will signal when the element of the filter needs to be replaced, allowing the maximum life of an existing filter element and providing the best engine protection. This PFFRG does not interfere in any way with the normal flow of fuel to the engine. Preliminary cost estimates indicate a possible payback of the cost of the PFFRG at the time the first or maybe second filter element would have been replaced prematurely. In Phase I, Foster-Miller will design, build and test a first set of prototypes and demonstrate their operation. In the Phase I option the first production prototype will be designed and 12 samples will be supplied. In Phase II, extensive tests will be conducted to finalize the design, optimizing its configuration taking into account its cost and reliable operation. Also, studies will be made to adapt this PFFRG to other diesel powered vehicles which have similarly configured fuel systems.  BENEFITS:  This PFFRG will signal when the fuel filter element needs to be replaced, avoiding the unnecessary replacements which are occurring now. Both the military HMMWV and the commercial Hummer will immediately benefit of its use. Similar PFFRGs can be used to provide savings in other types of military vehicles with similar",

        "abstract": "Not Available  Special technology and circuit architecture is under investigation for implementation of radiation hard low power electronics (LPE) which operate at low supply voltages and consume low power levels without sacrificing performance. Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) substrates have advantages which make it attractive for applications that require tolerance to radiation effects. A significant aspect regarding commercial application of SOI is the inconsistency of the gate oxide integrity (GOI) of CMOS circuitry. The variation in the gate oxide breakdown may be attributed to such material factors as surface roughness, defect density or metallics. Testing is typically expensive and time consuming. An opportunity exists to establish a test methodology for starting SOI material using pseudo gate oxide structures and a polysilicon or metallic dot method of ramped voltage stress testing. In addition, a detailed examination of pseudo gate oxide integrity will be examined as a function of SOI surface roughness. A matrix of as-received and smoothed SOI surfaces will be examined using a 3-point pseudo gate oxide test method that requires a simple oxidation and dot contact process. Surface smoothing will be implemented using a novel gas cluster ion beam technology (GCIB). Commercialization of both the GOI test methodology and the GCIB smoothing is regarded with high probability.",

SiC bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) have received little attention due to apparent limitations of gain due ot device inefficiencies, ascribed to poor material properties. If the desired performance can be achieved, BJT's offer improved stability and higher power density than comparable field effect transistors (FETs). With only modest improvement in material properties and good esign practices, SiC BJT's for operation from 0.5-2.0 GHz can be designed. In this SBIR program Extreme Devices, in collaboration with HdB Engineering, proposes to design and fabricate high frequency (1-1.5 GHz) SiC BJT's using high power, ultra high frequency rf transistor design rules and Extreme Devices' novel supersonic molecular beam epitaxy process. The combination of device design coupled with the improved epitaxial doped SiC provided by supersonic beams will yield acceptable device performance. In Phase I demonstration SiC BJT transistors will be designed, fabricated and characterized. Phase II will design and fabricate large, high power devices and a prototype high power pulsed transmitter amplifier.",

Much progress has been made in technologies requiring the use of microfluidics, but a fundamental problem that still remains is the interface by which microfluidic systems are connected to the larger, macroscopic world. Thus far, most laboratory prototype systems have relied upon bulky, expensive, and fragile small-bore tubing and connectors for interconnections. HPLC fittings and tubing are very popular for this purpose. Even while the microfluidic system can in some cases be inexpensively produced by batch fabrication methods, the introduction of small-bore tubing and connectors increases the cost of such a system drastically.  JCP Technologies proposes to develop a new strategy for modular microfluidic interconnections based upon a novel means for microfabrication called soft lithography. This strategy will emphasize modularity, low cost of manufacture, adaptability to the existing methods of fluidic interconnects, low dead volumes, and the ability to be disassembled and reassembled with precision, positive fastening mechanisms.

        "abstract": "Not Available  Many types of military and commercial aircraft rely on the use of high-pressure oxygen cylinders to provide respiratory oxygen to crew members during emergency conditions. These cylinders require frequent replenishment to  top off  the oxygen gas lost during testing, inspection or use. Maintenance crews must refill cylinders on the ground. Cylinders are removed from the aircraft for refilling or are refilled in place using land based equipment. The procedures are time consuming, expensive and hazardous. There is a real danger of accidents and fire as a result of oxygen cylinder refilling. The overall goal of this program is to develop an aircraft oxygen generator for trickle-charging high-pressure gaseous oxygen supplies. The Phase I feasibility program will attempt to provide a conceptual design of the proposed system using a Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) based electrochemical stack as oxygen generator. A bench-top model capable of generating oxygen at a rate of 1 liter per minute will be built and tested to provide performance data. A study of compressor technology that can meet the requirements of size, weight and input power for this application will be conducted and a conceptual design for aircraft system would be presented.",

Despite progress, the use of pressed powders for thermal battery cathodes, anodes, and separators has several intrinsic limitations, including high labor costs associated with material processing (blending, pelletizing, and QC of thickness and weight). A more efficient means of providing thin electrodes would dramatically increase the volumetric and gravimetric efficiency as well as the rate capability of thermal batteries. In another Phase I program, US Nanocorp (USN) and Sandia successfully demonstrated the feasibility of fabricating viable thin film large-area FeS2 cathodes for thin cell thermal batteries using the industrial technique of thermal spray. USN developed a patent pending process (to repress pyrite decomposition in the plasma) to spray FeS2 cathodes. The proposed program leverages the remarkable success of that effort to optimize thermal battery electrode structures for high rate applications using DC arc plasma spray, specifically with regard to controlling porosity and pore size, in a continuous low-cost manufacturing process. USN has engaged Sandia in the Phase I program to assemble and evaluate thermal battery cells using USN's thermal sprayed electrodes.",

The technology will make systems formerly requiring hazardous explosives not only safer and more energetic but also less environmentally disruptive and lower in cost. Analysis shows that Metafex energy densities are more than twice as great as those of conventional explosives. Because the energy density is greater, weapon components can be made smaller and/or more effective, yet safer, if they use Metafex in place of explosives. There are many US Navy applications, including linear shaped charges (LSC's) for salvage and obstacle clearance operations. By replacing the high explosive with Metafex, LSC's will be safer. Because they will be safer, they will be less costly to manufacture, to ship, and to use. Also, disposal of obsolete ordnance will be non-hazardous. In contrast to conventional ones, the proposed LSC's require no explosives. They are environmentally benign, can be safely shipped anywhere; and need no special handling. They will be inert until activated by energetic electrical pulses. In Phase I of the proposed project, Metafex test samples will be built and tested, and the technology will be adapted for use in LSC's.",

Identify areas of risk where migration to Java will be difficult. Explain the fundamental reasons for the risks, and offer potential solutions to the problems. 3) Develop a software specification for a set of candidate applications described in task 2.

At every container depot in the world, whether it is at a modern seaport, or a quickly established military field unit, the container must either be transferred using expensive material handling equipment located at the site or the container is stored on an expensive chassis until it is ready to move out. Many problems would be solved if the chassis holding the container were able to load or unload the container without the need for additional MHE or manpower.  Such a concept is only practical if the solution can provide a number of qualities such as: the ability to be adapted to existing chassis and flatbeds; the ability to work efficiently when operated by a single unskilled driver; low costs; does not dramatically reduce the carrying capability of the truck; etc. Phase I result will be a concept that is both technically and economically feasible. This proposal presents a clear and concise methodology for the development of the concept. The proposer's past successes in producing innovative technology lends assurance that the methodology will lead to a concept that will have an excellent chance of performing as desired.

We will fabricate large mode tapered lasers with a curved or a straigh AR-coated pre-amplifier monolithically integrated with the power amplifier. The curved waveguide allows an angled input facet which effectively reduces the facet reflectivity to broadband reflectivities of order less than 1 x 104. We will then integrate a fiber Bragg grating with the pre-amplifier/power amplifier chip. This will ensure that the laser lases at a frequency governed by the fiber Bragg grating. This frequency will be largely independent of the output power of the device. It is then possible to focus the light from the tapered output end of the laser into a single mode optical fiber. The different wavelength laser outputs will then be directed on the different inputs of an arrayed waveguide grating and wavelength multiplexed creating a unique output in a single mode fiber with power equaled to the combined power of the individual lasers (minus the intrinsic loss of the multiplexer). This approach does not require phase coherence between the individual tapered laser sources.

These must address the availability of increasing volumes of hyperspectral images, as well as the novel nature of the ultra-spectral data characteristics.

Our design strategy combines the novel uniresolution feature of PONS, the Prometheus Orthonormal Set, with PCA, principal component analysis. PONS is used to represent spatial information in a highly compressed version while retaining information over the entire image. PCA captures the dominant chromatic features of the image. The characterstics of PONS-PCA transforms are essential for meeting the challenges of dynamic range compression and spatial registration of multi-spectral static and moving image streams.",

However, many applications have been limited by laser-induced absorption commonly referred to as gray tracking. While significant improvements have been made in the damage resistance of KTP, many users still report laser induced damage in high average-power, high repetition-rate or continuous wave applications. Recent advancements in the understanding of laser induced gray tracking in KTP and improvements in crystal growth indicate that the damage susceptibility in these applications can be significantly reduced or eliminated. We propose to implement new growth techniques to produce KTP that will be superior to currently available material. Improvements in crystal quality will be determined through measurement of relevant fundamental materials properties as well as through high rep-rate and cw laser operation.",

This will be used as a baseline for a comparison with alternative hullforms to support the design of a High Speed/Endurance Mine Warfare Craft. The proposed Phase I program will develop a work breakdown structure associated with the autonomous mine warfare craft which will address the areas of vessel naval architecture, mine warfare capabilities, autonomous control and communication systems and interactivity with mother and sister vessels. The naval architecture approach will be used to establish vessel requirements in terms of payload, speed, range, endurance, handling systems, etc. These requirements will be used to size alternative candidate hull forms, their scantlings and associated power plants to meet the performance and mission goals using the most advanced hydrodynamic and structural analysis modeling methods available. The relative merits of the candidates will then be identified and the most promising recommended for further development in Phase II. Scale model testing of the best candidate(s) may be carried out in the Phase I Option to confirm hull form performance predictions.

In addition to magnetic heading, the system also measures the pitch of the sensor head.

The implication is that signal detection and classification must now be performed on the time series outputs of a large number of beams. Current and planned buoy to aircraft communications channels cannot accomodate this increased load. Current multiple beam sensors (ADAR) address this by reduced frequency band coverage relative to the former DIFAR full band. Even with this reduced coverage, which may cause signals of interest (SOI) to be missed, transmitting raw acoustic data from all beams and sensors would overwhelm the operators. This effort addresses the problem by defining innovative system-level concepts and algorithms for autonomous in-buoy detection and contact processing of the beam time series such that only critical target information is transmitted to the monitoring aircraft. A goal will be to restore the full band of acoustic signal processing while minimizing power consumption. Although the emphasis is on active search processing the concepts are extensible to passive search and nontraditional methods as well.",

In the SSM, a simple micro-spacecraft derived vehicle is employed which could cheaply investigate multiple targets and simultaneously demonstrate the utility of small solar sails. The SSM reduces technology risk by using off-the-shelf aluminized mylar. A very small core vehicle with short range communication systems drastically reduces the size of the sails, allowing the spacecraft to be launched as a hitchhiker payload.  Because the spacecraft is small, the sail is small, allowing it to be self-deployed using either a rolled spring-steel or inflatable self-deploying boom system. Because of its maneuverability, the SSM could visit multiple targets, engaging in photographic inspection of friendly or adversarial satellites. A SSM could be used to disable or destroy other satellites by parking itself in a position where it blocked the target spacecraft's solar arrays. It could also be used to interfere with the operation of an opponent's remote sensing vehicle by using its sails to block the view.

Verification of these student's participation, through biometric methods, such as finger print or retinal scans, is an important step in certification of the training. Verification of the student's identity is also an important requirement in situations where access to the training data must be controlled. The same identical problem exists commercially for  off-campus , continuing education and other forms of distance learning programs. Verifying that the participant is in fact the student being certified and not a  stand in , for whatever reason, and that this person is authorized to access the training data is important for many reasons. The use of Smart Cards, represents the latest technology to be used in the commercial world, for control and access to confidential data, such as for Internet commerce or retention of personal medical data. Smart Cards are  credit card  like devices, which utilize an embedded memory chip (rather than older technologies such as magnetic stripe cards). The chief advantage of the Smart Card is that it can support multiple functions and may even include Java  Cardlets . The use of Smart Card technology is being adopted rapidly by the DoD in many areas. The Department of the Navy is one of the leaders in the adoption of Smart Cards for DoD use. Several initiatives have been launched to date, which potentially will put Smart Cards in the hands of all Navy personnel. These developments will include the use of  Smart Dog Tags  which allow the storage of a sailor's complete military record as well as emergency medical data, to be carried with them at all times, and potential inclusion into the Smart Ship program to support the overall reduction of crews. Adapting these cards, to be used as the access keys for distance learning and distributed training exercises is a natural addition of the use of Smart Cards to the Navy's Smart Card program and will help with the integration of training system technology into the  smart base  program and for shipboard training programs.

        "abstract": "Not Available  The key innovation of this proposal is use of Time Modulated Ultra-wideband (TM-UWB) transmissions to implement low cost, low power phased array radar and radio. Within the last few years low cost ultra-high precision oscillators have become available, and these now make it possible to build TM-UWB radar and communication systems which have no baseband frequency. The only signals transmitted are single pulses which can be generated by a single transistor which is either on or off. Impulses in the time domain generate very wide bandwidth signals in the frequency domain, and the signals generated by our current hardware have bandwidths in the gigahertz range. Since the transmission effectively happens over gigahertz bandwidth, this type of radar and radio is virtually impossible to detect and infeasible to jam. TM-UWB radio requires no frequency allocation since energy is effectively transmitted on a wide band of frequencies simultaneously. Likewise, as long as users use a different pseudo-random pulse timing, there will be no interference between users, and there is no problem with multipath transmission. Gigahertz transmission rates are achievable. Because all that is transmitted is binary pulses, implementation of phased array system is easy and effective.",

Single crystal piezoelectric materials such as PZN-4.5%PT are capable of near linear strains greater than 0.5% and a coupling coefficient as great as 92% allowing high output over a broad bandwidth. Accordingly, there is a desire to develop a transducer and/or actuator that capitalizes on these properties. Although large scale manufacturing of this material is not fully developed at this time, small sized pieces in small quantities are currently available. Because of this and because of the high cost of the small pieces, we have chosen a configuration that will allow both high displacement actuator and acoustic transducer operation with a minimum of adverse effects on the coupling coefficient. The design is based on U. S. Patent 4,845,688 and uses stiff lever arms to magnify the displacement without significant bending, which can reduce the coupling coefficient. With this design only small quantities of the single crystal should be needed to attain a high-output broad bandwidth acoustic transducer. We plan to develop a finite element model of the design and fabricate a laboratory model using single crystal material.",

This investigation will depart from past studies of this type because, in addition to identifying systems which fully meet all VIRGINIA CLASS (SSN 774) functional, environmental, and cost requirements, we will focus on identifying systems which provide the greatest capacity for achieving interoperability with the evolving global commercial wireless networks. We believe that by obtaining a system that provides seamless interface with the commercial communications infrastructure, as well as meeting all current and projected military requirements, the likelihood of premature obsolescence or eventual  stovepiping  of the system will be avoided.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  This program develops a novel fiber optic grating depth/pressure sensor that has greatly improved sensitivity relative to earlier state of the art fiber optic grating pressure sensors. Simple wavelength division multiplexing techniques may be used to support approximately 20 fiber optic grating depth/pressure sensors on a single fiber extending to at least 10 km with arbitrary placement. Time division multiplexing could be used in combination with wavelength division multiplexing to increase the number of fiber optic grating depth/pressure sensors that could be supported on a single line toward the range of 50 to 100. The Blue Road Research approach offers the simultaneous measurement of temperature and fundamental temperature compensation that is orders of magnitude better than that proposed in the literature for other fiber grating and fiber etalon based approaches. This for the first time enables the prospect of very high pressure resolution necessary for practical towed array depth/pressure sensors without extraordinary precision from fiber temperature sensors.",

It is based on a robust, low cost mechanical position sensor and visual indicator located on the catapult spreader. In addition, a remotely located optical scanner detects the presence of the indicator and automatically prevents the catapult from firing until verification. The innovation addresses the stated subtopic requirements of eliminating the dangerous Hookup Petty Officer role, improving the reliability of the alignment observation, performing the verification with a wireless approach under all possible conditions, withstanding extreme force and acceleration, giving fast response, and having high durability. With the proposed approach, there are no modifications to the aircraft, nor are there electronics located on the catapult. In Phase I, we will develop the mechanical catapult sensor as well as the optical scanner. We will demonstrate the feasibility of making the verification reliably in extreme conditions. In Phase II, we will produce field deployable units for shipboard evaluation. The long distance identification hardware developed in this program has significant potential for commercial applications such as automated tollbooths, smart highways, high-speed manufacturing, freight transportation, and security systems.",

This technology enables the rapid deployment of new network services for future Navy applications. This Phase I SBIR effort proposes an innovative active network architecture that would provide mobile warfighters with two powerful capabilities: 1) truly ubiquitous networking and 2) location-aware wireless network services (LAWNS). Ubiquitous networking refers to the ability of mobile devices to access information and communicate with a worldwide network anytime and anywhere. This capability is critical to implement the network centric warfare strategy of tomorrow that relies on rapid dissemination of information across all levels of the warfighting force. Location aware wireless network services (LAWNS) exploits the widespread availability of low-cost GPS cards for mobile computers that make warfighter location information easily available. LAWNS uses GPS-based location information provided by warfighter equipment to implement innovative protocols to support capabilities such as geographically targeted multicasts of information, range- restricted information dissemination, and location-dependent access to distributed information services. Such a capability will enable future situational awareness systems where intelligence and tactical sensor data must be exploited to provide customized, location-specific information to the force.",

Haptic information provided through the high fidelity stick force feedback system can transfer critical information, such as navigation, stall onset, proximity to earth, or other parameters using the sense of feel, thus reducing demands on the pilot's visual system.

Like SAM-based surface modifiers, these molecules will be deposited onto all of the exposed surfaces (not just those open to line-of-sight deposition) via solution.

In this low-temperature fabrication process, patterned thin layers of metal structural layers and polymer sacrificial layers will be built up through sequential deposition and lithography. Ultimately, the sacrificial layer will be etched away, leaving a self-assembled, integrated opto-electromechanical device. Each pixel in the 256x256 element array will consist of a low voltage electrostatic actuator capable of altering the phase of reflected light by up to one wavelength for visible light, with resolution of 1 part in 256. Mirror elements will be optically flat and smooth. The array will be digitally updated at a rate of 1kHz. Light modulation will be phase-only, with unity amplitude. Mirror fill factors of 80 will be achievable for square pixel sized from 20 to 30 micrometers on a side.",

The objective is to develop a practical window system that permits both visible and IR operation in the missile's thermal environment. The key challenge is reducing the in-band IR thermal emission from the window material. This emission must not fog the image to reduce ground target image contrast below the level required for target recognition. A Baseline system will be defined for comparison of alternatives. Special phenomenology issues will be investigated, especially non-traditional band pass performance. Window materials and configurations, optical band regions, modes of protection and deployment, focal plane technology options and missile integration issues will be traded to choose a recommended approach. Phase 1 will define system parameters and specify required testing for a proposed Phase 2 program. Window system design candidates will be ranked according to the terminal Mach number at which standardized images of ground targets are discernable. To perform this study we have formed a team of experienced specialists in aerothermodynamics, optical sensing, properties of optical materials, and IR and visible phenomenonology.",

Handsets utilize either Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) or Code Division Multiple Access (COMA) to communicate with the basestation. In both cases the networking complexity far exceeds that of first generation systems. Handset power control algorithms designed to extend battery life and minimize Co-Channel Interference (CCI) at the basestation result in low power transmissions and time varying handset output power. CCI is a significant challenge to overcome in successful DF exploitation of second generation MCR/PCS systems and is further exacerbated by multipath and dispersive channels that randomize the arrival times of CCI. A radical new approach to Direction Finding, applying Per Survivor Processing (PSP), offers the opportunity to achieve large performance improvements (e.g. interference rejection, rapid acquisition, multipath mitigation) over conventional techniques. PSP algorithms have been developed and simulated for MCR/PCS waveforms in dense urban environments. The focus of this proposed Phase I effort will be to develop an implementation capable of demonstrating the performance improvement of PSP applied to the mobile DF application.

The system uses an inexpensive light information transfer system to transmit information to a combat data display (CDD) for combat users.  The network uses visible, infrared or ultraviolet lighting as the carrier medium. The CDD receives and displays text and graphics information including up to date maps of mines.  This information is coordinated with OPS data. The system is remarkably inexpensive and robust because it requires no additional or special wiring other than that already typically used for lighting fixtures.  The system varies the light output of the lighting fixtures to transmit data at a rate so rapid there is no perceptible flicker. This information could include warning or status reports, technical specifications and instructions, geographical maps with individual perimeter or safe lane markings, telemetry from remote sensors, or any other information that could be transmitted over a conventional wired or radio network. Combat security is maintained because only friendly users will have the key necessary to decrypt the transmitted information.

        "abstract": "Not Available  ARGTEC is pioneering the use of a new, innovative technology based on the theory of Attributed Relational Graph for content-based indexing and retrieval in large information databases. We have achieved several breakthroughs in the development of this technology. We applied this approach to indexing and retrieval in Automated Fingerprint Identification Systems (AFIS) with a remarkable success. When tested on large fingerprint databases provided by the FBI and the British Home Office, it delivered > 99% identification accuracy (i.e., < 1% Type I error) and close to zero false alarm rate. In benchmarks conducted by the customer, it achieved better than one order-of-magnitude reduction in the rate of false alarms in comparison with other competing state-of-the-art approaches, especially when presented with partial information, e.g., poor quality latent fingerprints collected from crime scenes or similar uncontrolled environments. ARGTEC proposes to develop and implement a generalized content-based indexing and retrieval system for global information databases. We will expand the ARG technology used successfully in AFIS to a hierarchical ARG scheme capable of processing more generalized global information that contains textual and non-alphanumeric information at multiple levels of detail and resolution. We will show that the hierarchical ARG representation scheme, coupled with our suites of matching algorithms are especially effective in handling noisy and partial information. ARGTEC is working with several industrial partners in both defense and commercial arenas. Our commercialization strategy lies in converting our R&D effort into system innovations, then teaming with large system integrators to infuse it into fielded, operational systems.",

PAAs offer may advantages including steering without physical movement, accurate beam pointing, increased scan flexibility in two dimensions, precise PAA element phase and amplitude control to obtain low sidelobes, and reduced power consumption and weight. The complexity associated with controlling the many thousand array elements, while handling the broad bandwidth required of a shared antenna, makes the marriage of photonics and microwave radar attractive - especially when true-time-delay (TTD) is required for wide bandwidth and large scan angle steering. Our analysis has shown, however, that despite the attractiveness of utilizing photonics, the excessive complexity and cost and in some cases performance limitations of current photonic beamformer approaches will limit their acceptance in deployed systems. The novel TTD photonic beamformer proposed here offers a high performance but lower complexity and cost photonic TTD system using a novel combination of commercially available wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) components which we call WDM Delay Broadcasting TTD. In this approach fixed delays are encoded with wavelength and broadcast to all of the antenna subarrays.

In the Phase I program we developed a new class of materials that demonstrated rapid sorption kinetics, high capacity, and favorable selectivity for nitrates. A preliminary economic analysis indicated that the proposed process can significantly reduce the cost of water treatment, and will be applicable to numerous other separation technologies. All Phase I goals were met. The focus of this Phase II program is to 1) continue development and optimization of the new separation media; 2) design, fabrication and laboratory testing of prototype systems; 3) field-test of prototype system; and 4) an economic and engineering analysis of the process. The goal of the Phase II program is to bring the technology to the point where it can be commercialized. Based on the Phase I results, we have already attracted interest from sector firms that are interested in pursuing its final scale-up and commercialization.",

The proposed HiSAFF media is based on readily available, inexpensive holographic diffuser material. The compact, nonfibrous HiSAFF filter, which has a predictable architecture, high bipolar charge density, and low air resistance, is superior because it is highly efficient produces low pressure drop, can be easily cleaned and reused, and can be produced at low cost using mature fabrication techniques and commercial materials. In Phase I, design and performance testing of the HiSAFF will be completed; the filter will be evaluated for probability of success and Joint Service use. Successful completion of Phase I will lead to further development and optimization for filtering particulates 0.3 micron or smaller, to be completed in Phase II.BENEFITS:  This project will lead to low-cost, high performance, reusable HEPA/ULPA filter technology that can be used in a wide range of biomedical and industrial facilities including hospitals, clinical and research labs, clean rooms, and nuclear plants.

The CFET will enable the pilot the benefit of repetitive practice that simulates real world flight conditions, minus the debilitating fear of pushing the flight envelope and losing an aircraft. JIL experts will develop and validate Sensory Physiology Models that are adaptable to the CFET to achieve training objectives.

Further, tools that help visualize radio coverage characteristics over a given geographic area would enable the battlefield commander to evaluate placement trade-offs without the time and expense of physically moving assets around in the field. In order for such tools to be useful, the underlying software used to model radio wave propagation must be accurate and fast. We propose to develop propagation algorithms that will provide the same accuracy as models currently used by several Army systems, but that will run fast enough to support near-real-time applications. Our proposed approach is two-fold. First, we will analyze the computational complexity of existing Army models in order to identify and improve performance problem areas. Second, we will conduct performance versus accuracy trade-off studies on a variety of other pathless algorithms. This approach will allow us to address whether more efficient calculation techniques exist and if these techniques can be used in place of existing models. The end result of our research will be a software prototype of performance-enhanced RF propagation algorithms.

The techniques to be demonstrated could also be extended to other IUSW missions.

This approach maps observables into attributes associated with normal and threat behaviors. An essential feature of the approach is the ability to adaptively estimate behavior attributes and to accommodate new information and changes in expected behavior based on actual data. Classification of normal and hostile behaviors will be supported by environmental and behavioral models. The COD concept is directly applicable to on-going Navy surveillance information system development program (e.g. Littoral Surveillance System).

        "abstract": "Not Available  The application of space-time adaptive processing (STAP) to circular antenna arrays presents additional challenges when compared to the ideal case of a linear array oriented along the aircraft velocity vector. This is primarily due to the fact that the spatial characteristics of the radar returns depend on two cone angles, rather than one for the linear array. This increases the clutter rank and also introduces range de-pendence to the covariance matrix of clutter at a particular Doppler frequency. Thus, when covariance estimation is performed through range averaging, an error exists that affects the STAP performance. The challenges become greater when one includes effects such as aircraft interference and mutual coupling. The proposed research will provide greater insight as to how the differences between radar returns in cir-cular arrays and linear arrays impact the various components of STAP algorithms. Novel adaptive signal processing approaches that overcome the challenges present in the circular array problem will be investi- gated. These techniques will lead to STAP algorithms that provide both enhanced mitigation of clutter and ECM, and enhanced target detectability over conventional STAP approaches. Three basic compo-nents of STAP processing will be investigated: 1) Pre- processing techniques, 2) Covariance matrix esti-mation and 3) Weight formation. The causes of performance degradation of conventional STAP algo-rithms in circular arrays will be investigated and will be related to particular aspects of the target, clutter and jamming returns. Different techniques in each of the three components of STAP algorithms will be examined and their impact on the performance of the algorithms in different scenarios employing circular arrays determined. A table of promising techniques versus their performance impact and processing load requirements will be generated.",

The system introduces a number of innovations including: the use of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing as the baseband modulation strategy, single-sideband as the RF modulation strategy, and turbo trellis-coded modulation as the channel encoding forward error correction scheme. Orthogonal frequency hopping spread spectrum will be used to provide a multi-access strategy, secure communications, and high immunity to frequency selective multipath fading and interference.

The primary Phase I research objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of producing this oxidation-resistant duplex microstructure in a form that also exhibits good mechanical and thermal properties. Nanoscale silicon carbide inclusions will be produced in a continuous carbon phase using several variants of a unique processing approach, namely the blending of a silicon-containing polymer with various carbon precursors followed by pyrolysis. Appropriate precursor choices will enable the evaluation of SiC inclusions in amorphous, turbostratic and graphitic carbon matrices. The two-phase microstructure will be optimized for oxidation resistance and mechanical properties by varying the composition of the blend and the preparation conditions. Carbon fiber reinforced composite specimens incorporating the optimum matrix will be fabricated and tested for thermal and mechanical properties.",

Nitride based wide bandgap semiconductors have demonstrated potential (theoretically proposed and experimentally demonstrated) for realization of high power, high frequency transistors, due to their superior material properties and the existence of the AlGaN/GaN heterostructure. This is due to the combination of the wide-band gap and heterostructure in the AlGaN/GaN system, where high voltage, high current and low on-resistance can be simultaneously achieved, resulting in high power-high efficiency operation. In this program, WiTech proposes to develop a reliable high power AlGaN/GaN HEMT based microwave/millimeter wave device and circuit technology, capable of operating under harsh environments such as high temperatures up to 300*C. The demonstration vehicle shall be an efficient, linear power amplifier circuit operating at X-band, with ~5 W power level at > 20 Volts (Phase I) and 20-50 W power levels at 28 Volts (Phase II). Operation at 28 Volts eliminates the need for dc-dc voltage conversion in certain airforce applications, improving system efficiency and reducing cost. Further, WiTech will investigate components for GaN MMICs (Metal Resistors, MIM Capacitors, Spiral Inductors, CPW Transmission Line Wiring). Flip-chip technology for thermal management will be addressed in the option plan with a view of achieving higher throughput and lower cost.

To extend this technology to proximity fuses in small to medium caliber munitions and sub-munitions, it is now necessary to develop novel techniques for lower power consumption and further miniaturization by expansion of scale of integration combining RF and signal processing circuits. This proposal describes Hittite's approach to develop a highly integrated chip for the low-power ultra-miniature proximity fuses. The proposed approach is based on Hittite's unique circuit techniques and newly emerging silicon and gallium-arsenide semiconductor processes. The new processes allow operation of silicon MMICs at higher frequencies and integration of signal processing circuits in GaAs, showing a promise of highly integrated multi-function mixed-signal ICs. The proposed program will lead to definition of optimum scale of integration, selection of the optimum process, and demonstration of the feasibility of the low-power ultra-miniature fuses.

We propose a novel fluidic-controlled actuator that provides the functionality of several fluidic and piezo actuators, plus sensor and feedback control, in one monolithic MAFC device.  Phase I technical objectives are: (1)  Develop a system design and manufacturing plan for a multi-function monolithic actuator system, and construct system component prototypes, (2) Develop a plan for benchmarking the actuator system performance under realistic flight conditions, and (3) Develop system performance estimates based on well-defined flight test maneuvers and expected specific vehicle performance improvements.  These objectives will produce the plans, specifications, and basic designs required to support Phase II, which will include manufacture of the full MAFC system, installation in an instrumented RPV, and flight testing for performance benchmarking.",

These laboratories will involve hands-on experiments, computer simulations using the latest information sources (including the Internet), and problems that require critical thinking. In the first phase of this project, we will develop the instructional materials for several laboratory sessions, construct algorithms for the simulation exercises, create an interactive Internet database, conduct preliminary field-testing, and develop assessment criteria. The instructional materials will teach practical applications of current technology to real-world mathematics and science problems. The general problem-solving skills that are emphasized in the scientific method are applicable to all fields of study regardless of the students' career interests. This project will lead to a laboratory manual with exercises for introductory high school science classes. The manual will be accompanied by software that allows the students to perform complex mathematical computations on a desktop PC with real data that can be obtained from Internet databases.",

Both braiding (2-Dimensional or 3-Dimensional) or net-shape knitting may provide solutions for a more cost effective production. In general textile preforming operations allow for a much more cost effective production of advanced composite structures. APD will use its integrated design for manufacturing approach to assess which textile preforming operation is most suitable.  With textile preforming technologies it is also possible to create structures with a high toughness, by introducing through the thickness reinforcements. This may introduce means of controlling the ablative behaviour of the heatshield during reentry and provide for improved impact resistance.  It is proposed to do a thorough review of the current material configuration and processing cycle and to start from there the creative process of finding alternative processing methods, including the composite impregnation and consolidation phases.

Such unique combination of photosensitivity and large optically induced index modulation property of LC will make PLC the prime candidate material for a new generation of high performance holographic devices, optical limiters, spatial light modulators (SLM) and other signal/image processing and optically or electronically tunable diffractive devices. PLC materials, by integrating the phase modulating capability and photosensitivity into a single medium, would dramatically simplify the SLM manufacturing technology by eliminating the most costly and troublesome process of incorporating semiconductor layer onto the substrate of the LC-cell. In PLC materials, the nonlinear index modulation is caused by photogenerated space charge fields throughout the bulk of the film enabling large phase modulation, higher spatial resolution and faster response times. Our main effort in Phase I would be to fully develop the material, and identify the optimum material composition through quantitative studies of the underlying nonlinear index modulation mechanisms and dynamic holographic processes.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  Nanophase aluminum alloys are powder metallurgy aluminum alloys processed to provide very fine grain size, high strength, ductility, and toughness. The high strength is due to the combined contributions of fine grain size, alloying, and deformation substructure. Rocketdyne initiated a nanophase aluminum development effort in 1992 to provide alternatives to titanium for high-pressure hydrogen propulsion systems for launch vehicles, with the potential advantages of higher performance, lighter weight, and improved reliability. The baseline nanophase process developed by Rocketdyne, although capable of producing the nanophase aluminum required to support property data generation and prototype hardware fabrication, is not cost effective for commercial production. The Phase I program proposed by DWA Aluminum Composites seeks to establish a foundation for nanophase aluminum cost reduction by 1) demonstrating a flash degas process that will significantly reduce canned powder degas cycles, 2) showing that conventional hot pressing can be used to produce fully dense nanophase aluminum billets thereby eliminating the need for costly degas/HIP cans and HIP processing, and 3) that a process simplification is achievable through integration of the copper extrusion jacket with the billet consolidation step.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  Photodetectors operating at 8-15 um and beyond are of great importance for commercial and military applications in infrared (IR) thermal imaging. InAs/InGaSb type-II quantum wells (QWs) have advantages over HgCdTe for applications requiring higher temperature and longer wavelength operation. The type-II QW photodiodes would have comparable quantum efficiency and smaller dark current due to a larger effective mass and enhanced lifetimes due much slower Auger recombination rates, and hence much longer carrier lifetime. Through careful bandgap engineering, we have suppressed the Auger coefficient by a factor > 8 for 4.5-um type-II QW mid-IR lasers at 300 K. Recently, p-i-n photodiodes using InAs/InGaSb type-II QWs have achieved detectivities larger than 1 x 10 10 cmHz 1/2/W at 8.8 um and 78 K, with a peak detectivities of 2.1 x 10 10 cmHz 1/2/W at 6 um. We have studied InAs/InGaSb type-II QW photoconductors. With improved MBE growth technology, we have improved the responsivity of type-II photoconductors by a factor 50, due to the improved interface quality and material quality, and hence the better optical properties and longer carrier lifetime. Currently, we have demonstrated among the best performance of photoconductors using III-V materials up to 14 um. In the program, we will develop large two-dimensional arrays of IR photodetectors based on InAs/InGaSb type-II QWs at 8 to 20 um.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) offer significant military and commercial cost savings to the turbine industry. However, the benefits have not been realized yet, largely because of inadequate reliability and low thermal cycles to failure. The biggest problem lies with oxidation of the metallic bond-coat. UES proposes to use a patented filtered cathodic arc deposition system to produce a novel TBC system of high performance. The proposed approach involves depositing a 5 um MCrAlY layer on the superalloy substrate, followed by deposition of a high quality Y-doped alumina coating of 0.5 - 1 um thickness. Processing parameters will be controlled to obtain primarily alpha-alumina, whose main purpose is to drastically reduce oxidation of the underlying metal. The alumina will be coated with yttria stabilized zirconia using the electron beam physical vapor deposition method. In Phase I, we shall concentrate on obtaining a durable alumina layer, that also retards oxide scale formation of the underlying metal. Oxidation tests will be performed to measure its response to isothermal and cyclic exposures. Successful evidence of these capabilities will provide justification for a Phase II effort. The program involves teaming with Chromalloy, a major TBC manufacturer, who would like to install UES's equipment on successful demonstration of the program.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  Display systems for training devices and other applications that have the need for channel to channel seam matching impose stringent image mapping requirements. In high performance visual systems, image matching functions are typically performed in the image generator (IG) or the projection system. In CRT projection systems, image mapping is implemented using analog raster shaping. In digital display based projectors and monitors, pixel location is invariant, which, although providing the blessing of lifetime stability, precludes adjustment for seam matching. For such applications, high performance IGs can perform the image mapping functions. In application where low cost IGs or 3-D accelerator cards drive digital display based projectors and monitors, the image mapping function can be performed in an intermediate image-mapping system. Since such a system operates by processing video content, it is a logical place to include other desired video processing, such as multiple image suppression, and intensity modification to correct system nonuniformities and blend edges. Under this Phase I SBIR, DVC applies its extensive digital display and image mapping experience to define and recommend cost effective digital system solutions for mapping and other desired processing. They includes algorithms, software/firmware functions, electronic modules, with performance specifications for such an image-processing system.",

In this proposed research, we will develop advanced approaches for the first of these problems, position measurement, using the most flexible of all sensors, machine vision.  With today's and tomorrow's fast, cheap computers, we can equip those small video cameras with extremely advanced processing, including the most advanced mathematical techniques for solving the difficult problem of passive tracking in six degrees of freedom.",

Operation of weapon systems in these facilities is also of interest for ground based battle simulation as part of a larger simulation scenario. One area of particular interest that is not currently accommodated is the ability to inject targeting data from an external source (C3 or mission planning system) into a weapons platform in an ISTF for use in testing weapon targeting functionality as part of a coordinated operational scenario. The effort proposed here would survey external targeting data sources, establish requirements for a targeting data link simulation system to appropriately inject the externally generated data into weapon platforms under test, define a prototype system implementation, and recommend a follow-up program for development and testing of the prototype system. Adaptations of the basic system for similar commercial applications will also be addressed.",

Present day production machine tools control vibrations by optimizing characteristics of the structure and by adjusting process throughput. Unfortunately, the latter tends to result in overly conservative metal removal rates. A2Z Technologies Corporation proposes a Laser Vibrometer for optimizing machine tool feed rates. Our approach specifically solves the complex issues of 1) providing vibration amplitude measurements to an accuracy of 0.0001, 2) operating in the harsh oil/coolant environment of most machine shops, 3) providing up to 10 vibration sensors operating on a single network, and 4) providing means to operate under the wide range of surface conditions typically encountered in the machining environment. During Phase I, a prototype system will be designed, fabricated and tested. Testing will be performed both in the laboratory and in an operating machine shop. The Phase I prototype design and the testing activities will provide a low-risk, rapid transition into pre-production prototype to be developed in Phase II.",

The efficiency of container based logistic operations could be significantly improved by the development of a system which:  o could be fitted to an ISO-container by a small crew (1-2 people) and without mechanical assistance, and  o would allow the container to be towed around a site, or short distance on road or cross-country, by any prime mover, and  o allows the load to be positioned in any orientation relative to a ganged group of containers (that is, butted end-to-end, side-to-side, or whatever), and  o when not in use takes up minimal storage space and requires no special support (such as a towing vehicle).

The goal of this Phase I proposal is to develop, implement and investigate the effectiveness of a web-based training approach assessing teacher attitudes toward web-based training, knowledge acquisition, and the classroom integration of acquired skills. The training system will be developed using Authorware 5.0, delivered over the Internet, and accessible through a web-browser.

One such example is the x-ray sources widely used for imaging and non-destructive evaluation (NDE) of structural materials and composites.  X-ray tubes, originally developed at the turn of 20th century have not seen many changes in their basic  design.  The high current capability of diamond field emitters, for the first time, offers the potential to eliminate the heated cathodes and the introduction of microeletronic processing for fabricating  innovative array x-ray sources .  We propose to use the diamond cold cathodes to develop innovative conformable, two dimensional, fully addressable, multi-pixel  x-ray array sources that can be used with array x-ray detectors to construct complete NDE systems.  These sources will allow development of low mass, compact, portable and specialized imaging systems with very high sensitivity for NDE of various materials and components for military material evaluation applications.  In phase I project, we will demonstrate the feasibility of this concept by fabricating a 10 x 10 pixel array x-ray source.  In phase II, a complete NDE system useful for structural materials and composites will be developed.",

This novel approach, to construct a Yb-doped fiber laser in a traveling-wave (unidirectional) ring resonator incorporating a double frequency stabilization/locking system, will achieve the goads defined in this topic area.  The combination of intracavity frequency stabilization and external frequency locking will yield a very high frequency stability and a narrow linewidth, of the order of 10 Hz.  Another crucial aspect of our approach is to actualize the linear-polarization lasing to totally eliminate the polarization mode competition, ensuring a long-term reliable operation.  The Phase I effort we will analyze the fiber laser resonator design trade-off, through theoretical and computer modeling, to determine the best resonator configuration of the Yb-doped fiber laser for achieving an ultra-narrow linewidth, stable single-frequency, TEM00-mode, linearly polarized, few hundred mW and tunable operation.  We will also conduct experimental investigations to demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed Yb-doped fiber laser.

These radars will be designed using solid state active array (SSAA) antenna technology. SSAAs utilizing space-time adaptive processing (STAP) can simultaneously reject land clutter, EMI and jam-ming, significantly enhancing the radar's ability to detect LO targets. The Phase 1 research that is being proposed by Technology Service Corporation (TSC) will in-vestigate the transition of STAP into both a notional S-band area defense and an X-band self-defense shipborne radar. The requirements for these radars will be specified, the best-suited STAP algorithms will be selected and optimized for shipborne applications, and the performance enhancements will be assessed. An adapt-on-transmit (i.e. Inverse STAP) concept will also be investigated. A transition task and a Phase 2 follow-on effort will select available software tools, perform de-tailed analyses of the STAP techniques and define experiments that can be performed using NSWCCD and other Navy facilities to validate the STAP algorithms' performance.",

We propose a self-contained, miniaturized bioassay system that is capable of simultaneously detecting and quantifying the presence of 6 to 10 analytes in a single sample of less than 500 microliters volume. Such a diagnostic device has clear applicability to many industrial, medical and military sectors.

The system will be constructed by the integration of state-of-the-art digital and analog circuitry with novel miniaturized fluid handling technologies, optics, and highly specific antibody-based assay techniques. All analyte-specific assay components will be incorporated in a disposable molded plastic coupon, allowing the system to detect and quantify a wide range of chemicals, proteins, viruses, bacteria and biological fragments by simply changing coupons. The proposed system allows coupon re-use until a strong positive showing occurs, greatly reducing costs in applications such as counter-terrorism where most measurements will produce negative responses.

This approach addresses the need for advanced models that accurately represent loading responses of air vehicles under varied flight conditions. This is particularly important for cost-effective development of uninhabited air vehicles (UAVs) due to their increased agility and autonomy requirements. The Phase I theoretical development consists of two major elements. First is the development of a new indicial response formulation that appropriately reflects the interrelationships between aerodynamic loading and flow mechanisms. In particular, effects of vortex breakdown, critical state crossings, and control surface deflections will be addressed. For critical state crossings, a novel model scheduling approach will be developed. Second, advanced system identification techniques will be used to populate the components of the mathematical formulation. In Phase I, this approach will be validated using the developed software and experimental data to model the body-axis rolling moment of a 65-degree delta wing studied by researchers at AFRL. Military, industrial, academic, and research organizations will be contacted to establish channels for validation during planning and development.

Normally suppressed stationary clutter contains such information.  The objective of this project is to characterize the terrain elevation information inherent in the clutter, to devise and validate algorithms for recovering elevation profiles of the terrain, and to recommend signal processing techniques to process the ground clutter as an applique to existing GMTI sensors.  Our approach uses the effects of propagation (shadowing and possibly diffraction and multipath) together with a model of terrain scattering to reconstruct the terrain elevation profile based on clutter information contained in a sequence of GMTI scans.",

While vehicle concepts abound, they all face a common problem; very low-speed flight requires proportionately more power than higher speed flight.  This creates a need for a small, light weight, high energy density power supply.  One way to achieve the needed energy density is to build the power supply function into another part of the vehicle through the use of multifunctional structures.  This can be done by fabricating wings with monopolar fuel cells as their external surfaces, serving as both wing surface and power supply.  This produces only a minimal increase in drag, and forward motion supplies air, with only 50 cm2 of cell area required to supply 5 watts of power.  The internal portion of the wing serves as the fuel tank, with the fuel cell stack as one surface.  Further weight reductions can be achieved by using the metal current collectors within the fuel cells as antennas.",

Rather than first specifying a fusion approach and then testing it on various imagery, we will first analyze imagery to determine situations where detection rates can be increased and/or false alarm rates decreased by combining information from both sensors. For each such situation, we will test various promising fusion approaches and rank their effects on detection and false alarm rates using only imagery that is representative for the given situation. Finally, to automate the switching of fusion approaches, we will design a situation-adaptive expert system that determines when the missile enters a given situation based on sensed contextual information and on-board exogenous data sources. All sensor fusion approaches require co-registered imagery, but real-world sensors are frequently misaligned.

Participants explore and refine design concepts following design rationale and guidelines reflecting years of expertise. Recording the design rationale provides a basis for learning and gathering knowledge for future decisions. The objective of this proposal is the development of a web-based collaborative environment incorporating a design support system. This framework employs distributed agents technology for capturing, recording, organizing, and delivering design rationale as identified through the users' multidisciplinary interactions and interdependencies of the design activities. An innovative approach is proposed and implemented on an object-oriented framework to create a commercially viable product. A well-structured mechanism for pattern correlation implemented within a knowledge-base allows the system to provide services that support design activities in a multi-user and multidisciplinary environment. This facilitates trade studies for competing cost versus performance while assuring producability, maintainability, and quality as part of reducing the design cycle. The environment will be used for engineering design decision support and application management in a variety of existing commercial and DoD applications. In Phase I, the system architecture will be completed and its feasibility and impact will be validated on two present DoD applications.",

Such ceramic composites include glass/glass ceramic matrices reinforced with high strength and high modulus SiC fibers and are known to exhibit damage resistance and non-catastrophic failure characteristics. However, the low corrosion resistance and inadequate high temperature creep resistance, make SiC(f)-toughened glass matrix composites unsuitable for many structural applications. LoTEC, therefore, proposes the development and commercialization of SiC(fiber)- reinforced high temperature structural composites involving fully crystalline, sodium zirconium phosphate (NZP) matrices.  Two lightweight NZP compositions viz. Sr1+xZr4P6-2xSi2xO24 (SS-50) and Ca1-xSrxZr4P6O24 (CS-50) are known for their: (i) high temperature stability, (ii) moderately low thermal expansion, (iii) good thermomechanical and thermochemical compatibility with SiC, (iv) creep resistance, and (v) good hot corrosion resistance.  Phase I activity will focus on processing dense SiC(f)-NZP composites with and without an NZP-based interface coating and evaluating their physical, chemical and thermomechanical properties.  In Phase II, extensive microstructural and engineering analysis will be conducted to refine processing and design of the composites to achieve the optimum matrix, interface, and composite properties.",

Development of these systems would greatly improve the realism of remote collaboration, dissolving the boundaries between the local and remote physical worlds and between the virtual and physical environments.  Research in 3D reconstruction of remote environments has shown that it is possible to recover both object appearance and auditory stimuli in remote environments.  The past methods for modeling object appearance, however, consume enormous computational and communication resources, and require far too many sensors to be economically feasible.  These traits make real-time applications nearly impossible without fundamental algorithmic improvements.  We therefore focus our attention on techniques for modeling and rendering object appearance.  Recent advances at the Virtualized Reality TM laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) demonstrate that real-time 3D shape reconstruction is possible.  CMU and others have also shown that video-based view generation algorithms produce high-quality results, even in the presence of small geometric errors.  We propose to combine these components with computationally efficient algorithms for video manipulation using multi-processors and SIMD instructions to construct real-time, remote immersive collaboration systems.",

Plasma-sprayed coatings can have unique properties that are far superior to conventional coatings (paint, plating, etc.) in terms of wear and corrosion resistance. The plasma-sprayed coating would either entirely replace or be used in conjunction with more conventional paint-like coatings to achieve the desired color. The roughness of the plasma-sprayed coating would be controlled to provide the desired non-skid characteristics. The adhesion of the paint-like coating, if used, would be highly enhanced by the roughness and high corrosion resistance of the plasma-sprayed coating. Plasma spraying offers many advantages over other techniques for applying coatings, because it is inherently inexpensive, environmentally benign, easily scaled to production scenarios, and features high, easily controllable deposition rates. The approach has modest equipment and operator skill requirements and should be easily integrated with the present repair infrastructure. In Phase I, we propose to prepare and test sample coupons with various plasma-sprayed coatings to provide a basis for initial assessment of the suitability of these materials. We will also perform simulated shipboard environmental testing to assess corrosion resistance, hardness tests of the films, and abrasion tests to assess wear resistance.",

Otherwise, developers will generate expensive systems that either do not meet the needs of users, or compromise the decision making process of individuals and teams. We believe the solution is to develop tools for the system sponsors for front-end analysis, as well as for the designers and developers. To achieve this, we will take advantage of recent breakthroughs in the use of cognitive task analysis for designing information technologies, as well as the development of a new approach to team representation, Team Integrated Design Environment (TIDE). We will apply these techniques to the Joint Strike Fighter, to demonstrate that it is feasible to identify and represent individual and team cognitive requirements. Then we will design a prototype software tool to represent individual and team cognitive requirements. The tool will not be a simulation , but will be a support system for defining and displaying the cognitive features of decision makers so that they can be used as constraints in guiding the design and development process. During Phase II, we will construct a working prototype and evaluate its impact on representing cognitive requirements during conceptual design.",

The innovation in this work is the use of discrete noise control sources that utilize feedback control to dissipate acoustic energy. Acoustic energy dissipation is a robust method of reducing sound pressure levels in the interior of the payload fairings. The goal of the research is to provide payloads with a quieter ride to orbit through new methods of active acoustic suppression in launch vehicles. The motivation for this work is the control of low-frequency in small to medium-sized launch vehicle payload fairings. Low-frequency noise is a problem in launch vehicle fairings due to the lack of significant energy dissipation below 200 to 300 Hz. The conventional method for reducing fairing sound pressure levels is to line the interior with sound absorbing acoustic blankets. Although very effective at higher frequencies, acoustic blankets provide less sound absorption at frequencies in which the acoustic wavelength is large compared to the thickness of the material. The effectiveness of the passive acoustic treatment is limited at low frequencies by the thickness of the blanket material.",

Commercially available 3D rendering engines are able to meet these high fidelity 3D modeling requirements efficiently if they are given bump maps (which modulate the surface normals), as a supplement for the polygonal model.  At the present time, however, the development of these bump map textures is a difficult and labor intensive activity.  In an effort to reduce the cost of creating bump maps, the feasibility of applying automated techniques from photogrammetry and computer vision to the generation of bump map textures from photographic images will be investigated.  A preliminary design will be developed for a software tool that will combine automated techniques with selected user input via a simple user interface.  A working prototype will be developed to verify that acceptable levels of fidelity and automation can be achieved.  Input from a variety of source data types will be investigated, including photo imagery and existing 3D scene databases.  The generation of multiple levels of detail and smooth transitions between bump-maps and high fidelity 3D polygonal models will be addressed.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  A 9 month Phase I research program is proposed for studying the three-dimensional state of stresses at bolted/bonded joints in composite laminates, by using a new layer-by-layer hybrid BEM (Boundary Element method)-Sinc interpolation technique. The primary goal of this research is to (i) mimic the singular behavior of the three-dimensional stresses in the vicinity of a vertex (i.e., junction corner point of a laminated plate or surface corner point of a bi-material interface crack), and (ii) perform elastic stress analyses of bolted/bonded joints of practical composites having anisotropic layers, interacting cracks and arbitrary geometries. A Sinc interpolation coupled with boundary integral formulation is proposed as a replacement of the conventional isoparametric polynomial based BEM. This is intended to capture the accurate distribution of interlaminar stresses in the vicinity of singularities, such as those due to free edge, corner or a combination of both. Finally, since any three-dimensional numerical procedure is highly computation intensive, a singular perturbation method will be employed in conjunction with the aforementioned hybrid BEM-Sinc approach. Neither this type of computational procedure nor any numerical result is currently unavailable in the literature.",

To reach the goals of optical transparency, conductivity and environmental stability, we propose, in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University, to develop novel conductive polymer coatings. These polymers have an amphiphilic structure permitting them to form highly ordered monolayers and multilayers through specific surface interactions. The increased order gives rise to similar increases in conductivity, which translates to thinner, less absorbing films being required to effect ESD. Phase I will have the goal of synthesizing candidate polymers, developing uniform coating protocols for acrylic and polycarbonate, and evaluating the optical, electrical and stability properties of the resulting layers.

The V-22 platform utilizes three regulated AC/DC converters (CVs) to provide regulated DC power from the AC generator source. The presently used device uses a power topology that yields both a very complex device and electrical system. The current design provides a regulated DC output at the expense of reliability, cost, weight, electrical performance and aircraft system compatibility. Avionic Instruments Inc. offers to perform a Phase I SBIR feasibility study to verify that by utilizing a patented form of regulated transformer rectifier, the V-22 CV can be improved. Specifically, this technology will allow unit cost to be reduced to less than $ 15,000., overall weight to less than 25 lbs. and reliability to be increased by ten fold. A Line Conditioner-based AC/DC Converter (CV) is proposed that will, in addition to meeting SBIR objectives, provide TRU-like qualities such as high input power factor, low input current harmonics, high overload and short circuit capability. A reduced parts count enables the design to increase reliability and reduce cost. Avionic Instruments will examine potential semiconductor devices, new magnetic materials and novel thermal approaches to further enhance the design. Circuit models will be created and computer simulations performed to demonstrate comparative differences of various regulated converter topologies. In addition, a demonstration of the existing Line Conditioner-based CV topology will be provided to the Navy. A final report will be provided at the conclusion of Phase I.",

The vapor is condensed by heat exchange to low pressure cooling air at the blade root, and the liqued recycled. Stable cooling at very high heat flux has been experimentally demonstrated, usng a circular cylinder as the heat transfer structure. This program will develop RFC technology with realistic blade and condensor geometries, selected for rapid transition to gas turbine utilization. The Phase I program will develop a detailed blade and condenser hardware design, with measurements planned for the Phase II effort. The overall result will be demonstration of high temperature, high heat flux RFC operaton, providing a baseline blade design an system definitionfor integration into an engine. Mit and Pratt & Whitney will provide technical support and review. This cooling technology enables engine operation at higher combustion temperature, with corresponding increase in engine specific power.

There is a thus need for compact, time-resolved detectors that can be located in the near field along with a test object to determine the spatial distribution and the bremsstrahlung spectrum on  test  shots. AASC proposes to develop an instrument to measure the x-ray dose, uniformity and spectrum over a large surface area at the position of a test object in a high dose x-ray simulator with spatial and temporal resolution. In Phase I a prototype instrument will be validated on the MBS simulator at the Arnold Engineering and Development Center. MSB produces a dose of order 1 mca/cm2 with a 30-40 ns pulse-width over an area of 100 cm2. After the Phase I validation, the Phase II goal is to scale the instrument up to measure radiation from the Decade Quad source of about 20 krad (Si), 40-50 ns pulse-width, and 2500 cm2 area.",

To date the monitoring and forecasting of ionospheric conditions that affect RF transmissions is either non-existent or based on empiricism. We propose to lay groundwork in Phase I for an innovative packaged system of instruments, models, and interpretive software to both monitor and forecast accurately in a geographic sector the ionosphere and the degree of ionospheric disturbance. The system would provide local monitoring for specification and 30-minute to 2-hour forecasts of signal scintillations. Since the system is deployed locally its output could be directly connected into user applications and hence maintain the forecast lead-time. The deployed sensors are off-the-shelf, and have been primarily developed for DOD applications. These sensors would be linked via INTERNET, where available, or other real-time communication links to a system computer, e.g. a Pentium-based PC.

While the immediate application is in monitoring the equatorial and polar scintillation, the proposed technique, which ensures robust performance in the presence of severe amplitude and phase scintillations, will find numerous applications in providing reliable performance of GPS receivers. The technique can be scaled down to single frequency receivers as well. The novel multiresolution based technique has been proposed to achieve robustness in presence of severe scintillation.

In summary, the resultant target system architectures are a hodgepodge amalgamation of the builder's favorite proprietary hardware/software designs making growth, improvement or change difficult and expensive, with massive cable bundles, large and power hungry components and little to no use of industry standard hardware/software modules with the result of no commonality across the using services. Tremendous advanced have been made over the past decade in the areas of microprocessors systems, inter-module bussing, inter-node bussing and real-time operational software.

A logical and comprehensive study of the challenges to identify the appropriate state-of-the-art architecture followed up by a simulation forms the basis of this proposal. The recommended technologies and architecture will be applicable to airborne, ground based and sea based target platform",

The ESA method consists of alternately absorbing cationic and anionic molecules from water-based solutions onto substrates at room temperature and pressure to form multi-layer coatings.  Electrical, optical, mechanical, and active functional properties of the coatings are varied through incorporation of selected crystal nanoclusters, polymers, and other molecules, by processing conditions, and by controlling the order of the multi-layer geometry.  NanoSonic has demonstrated the ability to achieve high electrical conductivity, piezoelectric and photovoltaic behavior, ultra hardness and abrasion resistance, and nonlinear optical behavior in films; different functionalities may be incorporated into separate layers within a composite coating.  During Phase I, NanoSonic will study how coatings with different functional properties may be formed by ESA, and focus on a technology demonstrator consisting of an interconnected, directionally-steerable optoelectronic array on a flexible polymer composite substrate.  During Phase II, NanoSonic would develop methods for materials synthesis, and work with B.F. Goodrich to transition the ESA process to manufacturing.

This investigation found that turbulent loads are the driving factor in the design of these vehicles.  In particular, two-or three dimensional turbulent motions give rise to higher loads that those from the maneuvering or one-dimensional gust loads used in classical aircraft design.  Existing turbulent loads analysis techniques and data were found to be inadequate when trying to estimate the design loads for such flexible and lightweight aircraft.  It was also found that almost no statistical turbulence data exists for aircraft that cruise for months at extreme altitudes and may experience only one or two takeoffs and landings during their design lifetime.  As a result, the current generation of aircraft may have been significantly over-designed to account for uncertainty in the expected turbulence loads.  Solar powered aircraft may have been significantly over-designed to account for uncertainty in the expected turbulence loads.  Solar powered aircraft performance depends very strongly on being able to reduce weight.  This document proposes to investigate the feasibility of a system that, through both an active control system for direct reduction of turbulence induced loads and, through the indirect development of a significant database of high altitude turbulence information, will lead to reduced structural weight and greatly improved performance for HALE UAVs.",

Ultrasonic guided waves, Lamb waves, allow large sections of aircraft structures to be rapidly inspected. However, extracting quantitative information from Lamb wave data has always involved highly trained personnel with a detailed knowledge of mechanical waveguide physics. Our proposed work focuses on a variety of different tomographic reconstruction techniques to graphically represent the Lamb wave data in quantitative maps that can be easily interpreted by technicians. Because the velocity of Lamb waves depends on thickness, for example, we can convert the traveltimes of the fundamental Lamb modes into a thickness map of the inspection region. This proposal describes practical implementations of Lamb wave tomographic imaging techniques that will be person-portable and optimized for in-the-field testing of large-area aircraft structures.",

Security of agent software is a primary concern for U.S. Government agencies and commercial businesses, including those that are planning to deploy agent-based systems on the Internet. This proposal presents a Phase I project for the implementation of an intelligent agent security module. It describes an approach that utilizes the distributed object middleware of the Object Management Group's (OMG's)Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) as the basis for secure agent messaging, coupled with available Neural Network agent software from Computer Associates. The goals of this project are; to develop an intelligent security agent module which integrates adaptable wrappers through CORBA facilities, use neural networks for security intrusion detection collection, interpretation, pattern recognition, adaptive learning capabilities and demonstrate an intelligent agent security module to the Navy. The resultant system can provide integrated network administration and security management reducing workload to manage an intelligent agent-based system.",

In this work, Gallium based oxides will be grown by MBE using a specially developed effusion cell that is uniquely capable of high temperature operation in the presence of oxygen.  In addition, a new type of atomic oxygen source will be employed that does not damage the semiconductor-Oxide interface.  We will use this new MBE technology to (1) optimize the nucleation of oxide on GaAs and InP, (2) grow bulk oxide films with a bandgap in excess of 4.5eV, (3) and produce oxide films that possess good interface properties and a low residual conductivity.  The materials will be characterized using techniques including ellipsometry, Photoluminscence, C-V, and I-V measurements as a function of temperature.  In addition, a new type of MBE system that is uniquely suited to the high quality growth of gate oxides on III-V semiconductors will also be designed during this Phase I effort.",

However, the data directly collected and analyzed by an ALR-67 in an action area could be further exploited by sharing it with an off-board SIGINT platform that could fuse it with data from other ALR-67s to provide enhanced Situational Awareness (SA) for the entire strike group. Specifically, data could be used to geolocate threat emitters if the data could be time tagged, [Time Of Arrival (TOA)] and provided along with aircraft GPS data to a central node for correlation with data from other ALR-67s intercepting the same emitter data.  AVISYS, Incorporated proposes to develop a concept for modifying the ALR-67 RWR to provide its onboard processed data to a SIGINT fusion platform. The data could be transmitted through a high bandwidth distributed network such as the Navy's Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) The fusion platform could then perform the geolocation analysis using Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA)methods. The fusion platform could typically be an EP-3E or ES-3A operating in the vicinity of the action area, but beyond the lethal range of enemy weapons.",

(80%) proposes to collaborate with Utah State university (20%) to develop a novel, articulated, shape shifting portable robot (SSRP), possessing a unique hybrid walking and rolling locomotion capability and a highly terrain-conformable 3-degree of freedom structural geometry.  The concept employs snap-together lightweight modules, each with two extendable-retractable legs attached to an instrument chassis at rotatable hip joints.  Independently controlled omni-directional wheels are attached to each leg to provide speed and agility when walking or climbing locomotion is not necessary.  By rotating, extending or retracting its legs, the VPI concept (MANTIS) can also modify its geometry to clear high objects and pass under combinations of low clearances and narrow openings.  Importantly, it can maximize range and duration of a mission by using legged locomotion only when necessary, relying upon highly mobile and fast ODV locomotion when it is not.  The objective of Phase I will be to demonstrate that the MANTIS is technologically feasible and to show by DADS simulation that it is capable of meeting, or exceeding, solicitation performance specifications.  The team will be headed by Dr. Robert Gunderson, who recently retired from USU and joined VPI as its Chief Technology Officer.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  In order for solid rocket motors (SRMs) to achieve Integrated High Payoff Rocket Propulsion Technology (IHPRPT) goals of cost, reliability, mass fraction, and specific impulse, a significant improvement in throat materials must be made. Lightweight, economical, low-no/erosion throat materials are critical to achievement of those goals. Carbon/carbon (C/C) composites are used in this application; however, in tactical motors using advanced propellants, these components exhibit unacceptably high erosion and oxidation rates. And although the cost of C/C is lower than that of most ceramic matrix composites (CMCs), the relatively long densification times (weeks) coupled with the cost of fibers and preform fabrication makes the material too expensive for many applications. Therefore, the two primary problems preventing more extensive use of C/C in SRMs are survivability and cost. In previous work for the Air Force and NASA, Ultramet has demonstrated the outstanding thermal and oxidation performance of its patented Ultra2000TM hafnium carbide/silicon (Hfc/SiC) coating through arcjet testing of various coated carbon and CMC structures at the Air Force's Arnold Engineering Development Center and NASA's Ames Research Center. Surface temperatures as high as 4600 deg F have been achieved with no mass or dimensional change. The potential exists to increase the highly refractory HfC content within the coating in order to survive greater temperatures over the lifetime of an SRM. In this project, Ultramet proposes to team with the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), which has developed a rapid and cost-effective means of producing quality C/C material, and the Chemical Systems Division of Pratt & Whitney, which will provide test facilities and commercialization expertise, in order to fabricate and test a coated C/C SRM nozzle with economic and performance capabilities that far exceed those of current materials.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  Space-based imaging techniques require optical techniques in order to optimize target-to-background contrast. To meet this need, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes a Spectrally Optimized Smart (SOS) Camera, that will exploit and build on POC's proprietary Spectrally Adaptive Light Filtering (SALF) technology. POC's smart camera will simultaneously provide hyperspectral image acquisition and target-to-background contrast enhancement. POC's SALF technology is unique in its microsecond adjustability to light transmission at several spectral intervals, and simultaneous  on-the-fly  atmospheric hyperspectral image corrections, which are made directly in optical channel. These truly unique features eliminate the need for cumbersome computer hyperspectral images postprocessing, and therefore enable real-time, practical operations. POC's SOS Camera will operate in spectral intervals ranging from the visible to the middle wave IR, and will be able to track  on-the-fly  or stationary, or slow moving low contrast targets. The prototype SOS Camera will provide 512x512 pixels spatial resolution, at 30 frames per second. During Phase I, POC will design, fabricate, assemble, and test a prototype SOS Camera. In Phases II and III, POC will refine and optimize the SOS Camera for mass production and commercial distribution.",

(SSI) proposes to address shortcomings in current hyperspectral target identification algorithms and their evaluation by the novel approach of coupling the target identification process to first-principles radiation transport (RT) calculations that model atmospheric effects and atmospheric compensation errors. Several new and valuable results will emerge from this R&D program, including enhanced target identification methods and algorithms and a software suite, HITS, that will provide advanced atmospheric compensation, data simulation, target identification, and algorithm testing capabilities. The proposed work will be based on several state-of-the-art UV/visible/IR RT codes developed by SSI in collaboration with AFRL. In Phase I we will analyze hyperspectral data covering the 400-2500 nm wavelength region to investigate the impact of atmospheric effects on the performance of target material spectral identification algorithms. We will identify promising algorithms that can mitigate atmospheric effects, adapt an algorithm to incorporate atmospherically-related biases and variabilities, and demonstrate improved target identification. In Phase II we will develop the HITS software suite and exercise it with a variety of real and simulated data cubes, targets, and identification algorithms.",

In addition to being passive, with the accompanying 1/r^2 standoff advantage compared to active methods, the proposed technique uses the observables, degree of linear polarization and angle of linear polarization, which have been shown by us in computer simulations to capable of yielding high probabilities of classification (>80%) even for visually similar aircraft such as the F14 and F15. The proposed effort makes use of Aerodyne's infrared polarimetric hyperspectral imaging sensor (IRPHSI) which uses a novel time-simultaneous polarimetric measurement technique which yields perfectly spatially registered polarimetric measurements. The time-simultaneity of the technique allows operation in the sub-pixel regime, which is essential for practical spaceborne applications, possible. The proposed effort consists of formulating a test plan for collection of surface-based field data with the IRPHSI sensor, extension of our existing air-to-air NCID performance analysis to spaceborne configurations, collection of field data, and quantification of the passive NCID effectiveness.",

A critical need exists to neutralize airborne chemical agents, in the event of their deliberate, collateral or accidental release. Sonic flocculation is a proven technique that rapidly and efficiently settles airborne droplets, dust and smoke. Intense high frequency sonic fields induce the rapid agglomeration of suspended particulates. The resulting heavier particles rapidly settle from the air to the ground. During Phase I, SARA will perform critical experiments to quantify the sonic frequency and intensity levels required to rapidly (under 30 seconds) neutralize airborne fogs and dusts. Similar materials will be chosen to provide particle sizes and densities comparable to actual specified chemical or biological warfare agents. To achieve sonic flocculation of large air volumes, high energy sources are required (?10\u00c2\u00bfs of kilowatts). SARA\u00c2\u00bfs high energy acoustic beam weapon technology can significantly exceed these acoustic powers. Our Phase I experiments will be used to design the Phase II test device for critical outdoor (field demonstrations).

The acoustic arrays and connected fiber-optic micro-cables will be deployed from a near bottom Towed Deployment Vehicle (TDV). Makai has previously developed a real-time cable deployment control system which has been used in a number of precision commercial and military cable lays. It is proposed that Makai's installation model and cable lay simulation software be modified and used as the primary analytical tool for this project. Cable location and array orientation results computed by existing models will be compared with measured experimental data. Discrepancies between model results and measurements will be subjected to a sensitivity analysis to identify the error source and to quantify the error magnitude. Discrepancies can be attributed to inaccuracy of input data (e.g. current meter and navigational equipment inaccuracy) and to the numerical approximations in the cable models. Several existing cable models will be evaluated to determine the modifications and effort that would be required to adapt them to Navy real-time operational and data acquisition requirements.",

Sensant Corp believes that recent improvements in transducer technology that now enable air-coupled inspection may overcome many of the traditional shortcomings of costly, time-consuming ultrasonic inspection systems for large areas. The recent application of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) technology to ultrasonic devices has created an advanced ultrasonic sensor with significantly improved dynamic range (110 db) and wide range of operating frequencies in air (2-12 MHz). These new ultrasonic transducers are fabricated in the same manner as a silicon chip using a technique known as micromachining. In many cases, these devices enable the possibility of air-coupled, non-contact inspection of materials as demonstrated by Sensant using aluminum and Plexiglas sheets. For this research, Sensant will characterize the acoustic properties of the multi-layer material to be inspected and will determine the required properties of an ultrasonic inspection system. Then, the company will develop a custom MEMS transducer to investigate the feasibility of ultrasonic inspection of multi-layer materials. To ensure rapid inspection of large areas, Sensant will evaluate both a longitudinal wave and lamb-wave approach using arrays of focused MEMS transducers.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  Crystal oscillators, whether simple clocks or precision frequency references, are used in almost every present-day electronic system, and this is expected to remain true for the foreseeable future. The success of numerous weapons systems now under active development depends upon electronics packages capable of withstanding very high acceleration and mechanical shock, most of which will also use crystal oscillators. Applications include guided munitions, smart fuzes, and penetrating weapons. For this program we are interested in the application to Extended Range Guided Munition (ERGM), which will incorporate on-board GPS receivers as part of the guidance system. The receiver requires a frequency source whose accuracy determines the time to acquire the first satellite. To meet the allowable thermally induced frequency shift this will be a TCXO - - a temperature-compensated crystal oscillator. Although the circuitry of a crystal oscillator is relatively shock inert, the conventional crystal resonators used are inherently susceptible to shock. To manufacture crystal oscillators shock-hardened up to 30,000 G there is a corresponding need for hardened resonators. PTI has been intimately involved over the past decade in the development of resonator shock-hardening technology. Each technique developed to date has certain limitations, different for each. By combining techniques we feel that inherent failure mechanisms can be eliminated. This first phase of this program will demonstrate that the combination of techniques which we have mastered, can produce a much more rugged but still economical resonator. In this program PTI will develop the solutions needed to meet the objectives of this solicitation in an economical manner.",

These laminates are typically produced at high pressure using a heated press at about 150 degrees C for 20 to 30 minutes. It is suspected that, when using traditional fillers, the high surface resistance of the very topmost layer may be a key to poor static dissipative performance. Being more compatible with the resin than traditional conductive fillers, ICP additives should improve the conductivitiy of the working surfaces mainly due to enhanced additive/resin dispersion. Using specially generated criteria the ICP additives suitable for the task will be selected and designed. Initial laboratory tests will be used for screening of pre-selected (commercially available and custom synthesized at Eeonyx Corporation) ICP additives. The ICP additives will be first tested for compatibility (dispersion) with the MF resin. Secondly, experimental laminates will be formed and tested for electrical and mechanical performance. Several routes will be investigated. One of the ways to improve the dispersion of the additive and the mechanical integrity of the laminate surfaces will be chemical bonding of the ICP additive with the MF resin.",

        "abstract": "Not Available With the emergence of the Internet, information systems are increasingly vulnerable to cyber warfare.  Existing approaches to information systems security focus on component level vulnerabilities that are already known to exist.  What is needed is an approach that targets strategic vulnerabilities at a system-wide level.  In order that such an approach be applicable to attacks that may be devised in the future, adversaries need to be modeled in a relatively generic fashion.  Further, the approach should be capable of suggesting countermeasures and of providing the system security officer with a visualization of the tradeoffs.  The central contribution of the proposed work will be the development of a tool, called Mitigator, that will model adversary threats and suggest countermeasures to offset identified vulnerabilities.  It will help the system designer and security administrator to predict where red teams will attack the system and to handle the tradeoff between risk, performance, cost and functionality.  To provide these capabilities, we propose a market-based multi-agent approach based on time-tested game theoretic concepts from economics.  We will demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by applying it to DARPA's Advanced Logistics Program (ALP).",

        "abstract": "Not Available  Stress-induced birefringent fibers are critical components for fiber sensor systems such as fiber-optic gyroscopes. An advanced technique to precisely align the principal axes of the fibers is required. Especially in fiber optic gyroscopes, the principal axes of a fiber optic coupler and sensing fiber loop should be aligned as exactly as possible. NZ Applied Technologies proposes to develop an innovative method for an accurately alignment of two birefringent fibers. The method employs a scanning Michelson interferometer, a scanning Retro-reflector and a special arrangement of a Wallaston prism to measure the dual interference signals. This type of device overcomes the major drawbacks of current devices and simultaneously possesses the desirable charateristics of highly accurate, rapid and continuous scanning with low cost of manufacturing. An advanced signal processing method will enable us to reach a measurement dynamic of 80dB which corresponds to an angular misalignment of 0.057\u00c2\u00bf. With the existing signal processing program a display in the wavelength spectrum is possible by a Fourier transformation. In phase I, a breadboard device with available input and output optical couplers will be constructed and its functionality will be demonstrated on an optical table for testing a variety of the Fiber-Optic Gyroscope (FOG) devices.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  Chirp Corporation's biomimetic SAS software detects and classifies buried mines by using clutter feature images.  A weakly reflecting target appears as a distinctively shaped hole in surrounding volume clutter.  Chirp's rotation-invariant target classifier uses dolphin-like signals for mine discrimination.  Mines are also discriminated from other objects by using composite rough/smooth feature images that identify the relatively smooth outer case along with reflections of rough, granular explosive from inside the mine.  Chirp uses a semi-coherent, Doppler tolerant broadband tomographic imaging system that is easier to implement and is more robust than fully coherent SAS.  All signal processing functions are commensurate with animal sensory system capabilities.  Chrip's SAS is equivalent to back projection tomography (as in medical imaging) but is more general because it utilizes feature images and image-based tracking for motion compensation.  Higher cognitive function can be emulated by top-down/bottom-up SAS processing, which corresponds to algebraic reconstruction (ART).  ART-SAS can be used for image interpretation, sharpening, and multi-path combining via a RAKE-like matched field processor.  Area coverage rate is increased by using rotated wavelet models of dolphin space-time transmission patterns, high power pulsed sources, and/or low frequency Doppler tolerant bat-like FM signals.  Objectives are to test and develop this system.",

However, only the JSF contractors, who will attempt to develop an aircraft and support structure meeting the JSF requirements for Autonomic Logistics, are looking at the process. No Air Force agency has assumed the responsibility for fully defining the concept and insuring all aspects are covered with required research and evaluation.

These harsh operating conditions and the necessity of using materials with high strength-to-weight ratio requires the use of advanced materials such as carbon-carbon (C/C) composites. Poor oxidation resistance is a major problem for C/C composites which limits their use to inert atmospheres or applications requiring short-term exposure to air. The most common methods to apply the surface coatings are by chemical vapor deposition and slurry coatings. However, these methods involve the use of vacuum which will not permit these techniques to be used on large scale structures. Hence, there exists a need to develop a surface coating technology to improve the service life of C/C composites above their current capabilities.  Karta proposes to develop an innovative coating technology using lasers for forming complex phase coatings on C/C composites to improve their oxidation resistance. The technique involves preparation of a complex composition salt paste, placement of the paste on the composite substrate, and irradiation of the paste and the substrate with a laser. The microstructure and oxidation resistance coated samples will be evaluated. The inherent advantages of laser processing makes this approach very promising and has the capability to meet the industrial needs in enhancing the performance of composites.",

It uses the smart actuation system to activate/excite the aerodynamic effectors to generate unsteady air loads, 3. The actuators have large magnification factors so as to limit strains of piezoelectric materials within safe margins, 4. Aerodynamic effectors deform continuously and smoothly providing efficient aerodynamic authority, 5.

        "abstract": "Not Available  The failure analysis of nickel superalloy gas turbines and rocket components is plagued by a major problem: the masking of the unprotected fracture surfaces by thin oxide films formed during operation of the system. Such oxide films mask the fracture surfaces and make them very difficult, if not impossible, to analyze. Current fracture surface cleaning techniques (acetate film replication and plasma etching) are inadequate for removal of the oxide films and preservation of the fracture surface respectively. Inhibited chemical etchants to remove oxide films from steels have been developed to preserve the base metal during pickling in the manufacturing processes. No similar process is required during nickel superalloy production and, therefore, no such inhibitor has been developed to date. In this project, Ultramet proposes to use activated atomic hydrogen gas to rapidly remove all the oxide ions from superalloy fracture surfaces, thus producing exclusively water as a byproduct and reducing the metal ions back to the metal. The proposed two approaches are universally applicable to almost any metal/metal oxide surface.",

These two market needs can be met by a single product which addresses the mutual concerns for high temperature stability and improved dielectric performance. TPL proposed to develop a high density material having a three-fold increase in energy storage density with improved thermal stability. A composite system is proposed consisting of two novel materials developed at TPL, polyimide copolymers with increased energy density and mechanical strength, and surface functionalized, nano-sized X7R barium titanate. Capacitor grade film of the composite materials will be fabricated and evaluated with regard to critical electrical performance parameters. TPL has extensive experience in dielectric polymers and hydrothermal titanate ceramics, including the development of doping methods to produce 50 nm size ceramic powders with flattened frequency and temperature response. Expertise in these two areas, in conjunction with industrial partners, will be used to develop  dual-use materials to satisfy the mutual needs of military and consumer products.",

They provide the advantage of being able to schedule beams arbitrarily, thus facilitating performance-enhancing functions such as increasing the scan rate on high-priority sectors or performing track-while-scan operations. In addition, the use of digital beamforming allows for the application of adaptive array processing techniques for use in interference mitigation. This includes space-time adaptive processing (STAP) techniques comparable to those developed for airborne radar for mitigating both Doppler-shifted cold clutter and mainlobe scattered interference (MSI or hot clutter). In this proposal we address the issues associated with implementing STAP in SSAA systems such as system bandwidth effects, computational complexity, and degree of freedom (DoF) reduction techniques. We outline a program for the development and optimization of SSAA architectures together with STAP algorithm development to achieve the objectives of improved sensitivity and robustness to interference sources. In addition, we illustrate the need for site-specific clutter models to provide a meaningful simulation environment for this development.",

For these reasons, there is a strong need to develop a super-alloy oxide removal method allowing for failure analysis testing and routine cleaning of Ni-based superalloy structures. Through this Phase I effort, SMP plans on developing a selective, dry chemical etching process. This process will have the ability to selectively dry etch superalloy oxide films from the internal fracture surface while leaving the non-oxidized metal alloy surface untouched. SMP plans to utilize its experience in chemical processing and precursor design to develop novel, tailored chemical approaches for superalloy oxide etching. The successful completion of this effort will result in an etching methodology which affords an opportunity to conduct failure analysis experiments and routine cleaning of critical Ni-based superalloy systems.",

Because combustion iwht swirl and gigher Mach number, the last compressor vane row and the first turbine vane are modified to provide less aerodynamic turning and less velocity change, thus reducing losses through all reduced with improved efficiency in support of the IHPTET initiative. phase I work includes combustor rig tests with varying degrees of swirl (0 to 60) and high Mach number (0.2 to 0.6). The rig test results will be used for comprehensive cycle evaluations to quantify the impact from high swirl/Mach number on cycle performance and size. Phase I test and analysis results will demonstrate that reduced losses lead to at least two tofour more points of compressor efficiency and one or two more points of turbine efficiency.",

While battery energy storage systems based on any cell electrochemistry can benefit from this cell-wise monitoring and control, the lithium-ion electrochemistry requires cell-wise charge and thermal management. The proposed system specifically addresses the requirements of high-voltage (>24V) high power battery energy storage systems in several innovative ways. The modular approach, by providing sensors, charge management, and thermal management at each cell permits scaling of the system to any number of cells for any pack voltage. The system architecture provides voltage isolation for circuit protection and safety and it may be applied to battery energy storage systems that employ a wide range of cell electrochemistries. The implementation is lightweight and provides a means for cost effective production in high volumes to ultimately serve commercial markets. The proposed technology has application to battery energy storage systems for spacecraft, aircraft, electric vehicles, Power quality management systems, and uninteruptable power supplies as well as a host of other applications. APRI has assembled a multidisciplinary team with all of the requisite experience to engineer the proposed system.",

The approach uses existing fatigue damage accumulation models but accounts for both damages created by the snap-throughs and in between snap-throughs. The proposed strategy relies on the decomposition of the response fields, i.e. displacements, stresses, and strains, into  jump  processes (modeling the snap-throughs) and  fluctuation  processes (modeling the vibrations around the buckled states). Further, a computationally efficient technique for the reliable determination of the characteristics of these processes in the presence of an arbitrary number of modes is suggested so that the proposed approach is applicable to both phenomenological studies for design considerations and detailed postmortem analyses. The validation of this strategy to the estimation of the fatigue life of a composite panel is proposed. Finally, parametric studies are planned to evaluate the effects of surface temperature, temperature gradient across the panel. orientation of the fibers, acoustic excitation level (SPL) on the fatigue life.",

These tools permit legacy vector map data to be efficiently refined by verifying their internal logical consistency and by improving the process in which they can be registered to more accurate image sources. Automatic validation of vector maps is accomplished by applying a set of logical consistency rules written in a rule-based language to query and modify the data. Automated registration of a vector map to an image is performed in the image domain, using image pattern matching techniques, and in the vector-domain, using an innovative raster-to-vector conversion process that takes advantage of ESEA's conflation algorithms to utilize legacy vector data. A flexible object-oriented vector database is used to adjust non-visible map elements, such as political boundaries, to maintain their consistency with visible elements. Phase I provides a conceptual design of the complete tool set. The tools developed in the project will significantly enhance capability for updating legacy map data to the accuracy standards required for the current and future GIS needs of the United States armed forces.

The design of the ammunition boxes will be accomplished by an integration of advanced armor-system and composite rocket motor casing technologies. The integration of these two technologies is essential since both ballistic protection and containment of high pressure gases are simultaneously required for proper function of this component. The desired result of an overmatch threat engagement is to contain the stowed munition by preventing ejection from the container, while at the same time venting any gases to the exterior of the vehicle. There are three elements that must be addressed in the design effort; armor protection from external medium-level threats, containment of the reacting 30mm ammunition, and venting of overpressure gases. This increased protection of ammunition within the combat vehicle will improve the vehicle's ability to carry out its mission with a reduction in both the risk to the crew and the vulnerability of the system. This will also lead to satisfying IM specifications and vehicle survivability requirements.",

In addition to reducing size and weight, unprecedented reductions in cost and power consumption have been achieved.  Unfortunately, performance has been the trade-off.  Sensor structures created from very thin films have low lateral sensitivity, and lack structural rigidity perpendicular to the substrate.  Bulk techniques provide promise, but may impede multi-axis measurement.  To achieve IMU performance necessary for next generation small missiles, hybrid processes need to be developed.  Current thin-film processes are characterized by alternating layers of materials such as polycrystalline silicon, silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, doped glasses, and contact metallizations.  Major limitations of current thin film MEMS fabrication processes are: limited inertial mass and cross-sectional area, fixed and constant layer thicknesses, limited flexibility for vertical actuation mechanisms, in-situ vacuum encapsulation, and choice of layer materials.  It is the goal of the proposed research to develop a thick-film fabrication process analogous to commercially available thin-film processes, such as MCNC's MUMPS process or Sandia's SUMMiT process.  This thick film process will combine SOI, wafer bonding, and deep RIE with traditional thin-film processes to provide a flexible process without the current limitations.",

These protective coverings are unique in that they not only offer protection from the environmental elements with an impervious, waterproof outer shell, but also absorb and wick away large volumes of water that may leak between the covering and equipment surface. Such a system would keep the surface of protected equipment dry and significantly reduce the occurrence of corrosion. The proposed composite coverings consist of (1) an outer waterproof membrane, (2) an optional radar absorbent layer, (3) a highly absorbent matrix, and (4) a mesh retaining layer. The highly absorbent matrix can retain up to 400 times its weight in water. Regeneration of the coverings is also possible, enabling the absorbed moisture to evaporate during dry intervals. In Phase I, we will develop prototype coverings and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.

Currently, EV filters are made using very small capacitors in parallel with real or virtual inductors. The inductor size is directly related to the filter size. To reduce the size of current EV filters, the capacitance of resonate capacitors must increase significantly by employing film dielectric capacitors to replace the bulk alumina or quartz capacitors.

While a variety of ongoing efforts are focusing on signal exploitation and feature extraction of the return radar signal, potential antenna design performance enhancements are beginning to receive more interest. As radar bandwidths are increased to extract even more information, the performance of the radar system becomes more dependent on the performance of the antenna system. This proposal outlines an approach to measure and characterize the performance of IRA class antennas for potential use in UWB SAR applications. The performance of the IRA class antennas will be parameterized by established UWB antenna characterizations methods and compared with competing UWB antenna designs such as the TEM horn and LPDA antennas. In addition, measured data from a 1/16th scale model of a Bradley armored vehicle will be used to demonstrate the potential HRR down range profiles of an IRA based radar system. This program is designed to quickly identify the strengths and potential weaknesses of an IRA class UWB SAR radar system. Concept feasibility will be demonstrated in Phase I, and design optimization will occur in Phase II.",

Interface coatings are required to avoid reaction between fiber and matrix portions of the composites, thereby permitting translation of the fiber reinforcing characteristics to the matrix component. The lack of adequate control over the coating of fibers by Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) continues to hinder progress in this field. Appropriate process sensors are a necessity in pursuing real process control and, ultimately, intelligent processing. In a prior Phase 2 program, funded by the Air Force, ATMI identified several combined FTIR techniques that provided excellent diagnostic capabilities for the CVD fiber coating process. ATMI also made significant progress in establishing the hardware and software infrastructure necessary to integrate such sensors into the process. Although several FTIR tools were purchased, their integration with the process remains to be performed. ATMI will integrate FTIR tools, for on-line gas and coating analysis, with its computer-controlled CVD fiber coating process. Key features of the FTIR spectra from the exhaust gas and/or the coatings will be related to specific input parameters and a simple model will be constructed. In Phase II, the model will be expanded and used to establish closed-loop control over the CVD process, guided by a computer-run algorithm.",

The algorithms will exploit a target subspace model that is based on intrinsic material properties and infrared phenomenology as well as a background model that is estimated from the data. These models will be used as the foundation of statistical tests for identifying subpixel instances of target materials. Since the approach is based on physical models, the algorithms can be configured according to ranges of thermal conditions and scene geometries, target/background spectral properties, and sensor characteristics.

Using a low-cost rapid densification process, mixed HfC/SiC matrix CMCs will be fabricated in one seventh the time and one tenth the cost taken to fabricate CMCs conventionally.  In addition, the density of the final composite will be >90% and the HfC/SiC matrix CMCs will offer considerable oxidation protection - far superior to C/SiC.

Processes like direct-bond-copper and other manufacturing techniques used to create Hybrid circuits are very time consuming, expensive, and produce hazardous wastes.  Thermal Spray Technologies (TST) proposes funding for the development of a novel thermal spray process for producing hybrid circuits.  TST recently developed the capability to deposit circuit traces directly onto polymeric based substrates using a sophisticated technology they dubbed the Thermal Spray Circuit Boards (TSCBs) technology.  TST also produces high-density ceramic coatings for electrical insulation in many of its current products.  TST proposes to deposit its high-density dielectric ceramic material directly onto a heat sink and then using its proprietary TSCB technology deposit a circuit pattern directly on top of the ceramic.  The successful development of a thermal spray process that would be able to fabricate hybrid circuits by depositing a ceramic layer on top of a heat sink succeeded by a TSCB on top of the dielectric would be tremendous in the amount of money and processing time saved.  The new commercial and military applications would be vast due to the flexibility in circuitry design and cost savings that this novel technology would bring.",

The compact and efficient laser design becomes possible due to recently demonstrated efficient generation of laser radiation in an electron-beam-pumped quantum well semiconductor structure at room temperature. The laser takes advantage of combining a well developed and cost efficient CRT technique with recent advances in the fabrication of the quantum wells and other quantum confined semiconductor materials. The laser parameters can be easily controlled by modulating the pumping e-beam. Innovative technology for fabricating the semiconductor materials with microscopic clusters will be developed and incorporated in the system design. This approach opens a door to the next generation of light weight, low cost laser devices capable to efficiently generate radiation in a broad spectral region using different semiconductor materials.  In Phase I of the project we will demonstrate efficient generation at room temperature for a number of different semiconductor materials. Based on the obtained results, the design of the e-beam pumped semiconductor laser will be finalized. The prototype 10W laser system operating at room temperature will be assembled and tested in Phase II of the project with final device delivered to the BMDO.",

A reduced order procedure using an effective and rigorous proper orthogonal decomposition technique (POD) is adopted to reduce all critical modes collected from an offline instability study called massive failure screening. It acquires the flutter/ASE sensitivity parameters using a unique computational aeroelastic/aeroservoelastic MDO/Analysis software tool ASTROS*/ASE, developed and advanced by ZONA under AFRL support since 1996. Massive failure screening and POD are essential techniques that will promote the efficiency of the parameter estimation for real-time system identification. Selections of optimal sensor locations and the on-line search and comparison of the critical modes with sensor outputs can then follow. The minimum variance control scheme proposed is a very efficient optimal scheme for output response minimization. Continuous on-line monitoring will be applied to the control system except the minimum variance control. Switch-on gauge is based on a threshold whenever impact or diverged responses overrides the gust/white noise levels. F/A-18 will be used as the baseline aircraft to demonstrate and validate the proposed reconfigurable controller in terms of its algorithm stability, efficiency, effectiveness to flutter/ASE instability, fault-tolerance, and overall performance with cost considerations.",

The Department of Defense has a requirement to ensure survivability of key military C3 and weapons systems against the effects of electromagnetic weapons threats. What is needed is an electromagnetic hardening technology that is lightweight yet offers high shielding effectiveness and can be integrated into the system design, is low-cost, field-expedient, and transparent to the user.  Transient liquid phase sintered (TLPS) conductive inks, now emerging as a low-cost approach to fabrication of printed wire boards, will fit all of these requirements if low-cost application methods, reduced cure/sinter temperatures and improved electromagnetic shielding properties can be achieved. TLPS inks comprise a combination of polymers and metal powders that fuse together at low temperatures to form a continuous metallic layer that bonds to common substrate materials. The objective of this proposed effort is to develop a spray-applied electromagneticpaint-shield with superior shielding that sinters and cures at temperatureswell below those of current TLPS inks.  This conductive paint will allow low-cost shielding to be applied to just about any electronic device.",

These tasks will be accomplished by leveraging our knowledge, expertise, and algorithms from 20 years of research and applications in terrain analysis and classification and from our collaborations with a number research organizations.

The PDE is a new engine concept that provides higher specific impulse than conventional rockets because of its constant-volume, nonsteady operating cycle. It also has several advantages because of its simple design. In PDEs a detonation wave initiated in a fuel-oxidizer mixture propagates exially in the detonation chamber, producing thrust when it loads the thrust wall. In Phase I we will identify the codes needed for modeling PDE operation and benchmark them against a previously developed prototype engine. In Phase II we will calibrate and test them in connection with all the key PDE processes: injection, mixing, detonation initiation, evolution, and propagation, venting of exhaust products, and the acoustic signature and structural response of a multiple-chamber PDE, thus enabling realistic end-to-end PDE performance simulation. Using these tools we will design and build a flight-capable full-scale propulsion system.",

However, scenes viewed with night-vision equipment under starlight illumination appear quite different from those same scenes when viewed under full sunlight illumination.  These differences include brightness variations due to the nature of the illumination and the responsivity of the night-vision systems, anomalous artifacts such as haloing and loss of low-light contrast due to the presence of intense light sources, and a loss of effective visual acuity under conditions of very low light.  As with other sophisticated technologies, a properly trained operator can effectively utilize a given system within the constraints of its performance limitations.  Flight simulators are an example of effective training mechanisms that provide safe, cost-effective, and observable educational platforms.  The difficulty in incorporating night-vision goggles (NVGs) into such systems is that current simulator display technology cannot sufficiently exercise or simulate the critical NVG characteristics described above.  In this proposal, we describe an approach to emulate the full range of NVG characteristics for out-the-window simulators.

We propose to develop a new technology for wireless transmission of pressure signals using a low power data link. Sending pressure or temperature signals through these data links would have a range of 2 meters, which should be sufficient to cover the distances necessary for turbine engines.",

These system do not satisfy USAF needs. The USAF has defined the need for high performance headsets: (1) Noise attenuation bandwidth needs to be extended to include higher frequencies 2,500 Hz. (2) There is a need for further intelligibility improvements. The BioAcoustics concept integrates: three important performance features: (1) unique  high-damping earcup cushions  (hybrid material arrangement) in an anthropomorphically correct cushion configuration to significantly improve passive noise attenuation in low frequency bands; (2) adjustable position, low impedance, receiver to enhance the audio-receiver-to-ear-canal coupling; an (3) Digital Active Noise Attenuation to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The fully integrated system concept is expected to attenuate greater noise levels (40 to 45 dB) in a broader band (20-2500 Hz), reduce the signal level required for audibility, and, thus, significantly improve user comfort and intelligibility. Special attention is given to noise cancellation algorithms to deal with random noise. We will domonstrate that the proposed Audio-Comfort EarSearl(tm) is a more effective passive noise barrier and more comfortable than their SOA circumaural earcup cushion counterpart.",

However, there is no low cost process for manufacturing of the 1300 or 1550nm devices at present because of the smaller refractive index difference between the InP/InGaAsP material systems compared to the GaAs/AlGaAs systems at shorter wavelengths. Princeton Electronic Systems, in collaboration with University of Michigan proposes to develop a low cost fabrication technology for 1300nm VCSELs using patterned growth approach which has been extremely successful for 1550nm devices. The VCSEL structure can be grown on patterned GaAs substrate, with no regrowth or multi-wafer growth/bonding process. The wide-band GaAs/AlxGaAs-oxide DBR mirror will reduce the growth time by 3-5 times. It will be possible to fabricate multi-wavelength emitters from a single wafer growth by simply controlling the mesa dimension. In phase I of this SBIR, we propose to design the VCSEL structure, grow the wafers by MBE, and fabricate the VCSEL devices. The devices will be tested for their performance including the high speed performance. We will demonstrate the feasibility of the devices in phase I and perfect them in phase II. We want to manufacture the devices in phase III.",

Current o-ring materials, while chemically compatible with existing aircraft fuels and hydraulic fluids, are subject to both low temperature and high temperature performance deficiencies and failure. New o-ring materials are needed that exhibit good low temperature performance characteristics at -40 degrees F, with a preference for -65 degrees F performance, while maintaining durability and service life requirements at operating temperatures up to 250 degrees F in fuels systems and 275 degrees F in hydraulic systems. Under the Phase I program, METSS will demonstrate the technical feasibility of using available material technologies to develop low temperature compression set resistant o-ring materials for use in aircraft hydraulic and fuel systems. The program plan presented by METSS will build on recent developments in rubber chemistry that have resulted in the extension of performance properties at both low and high temperatures. While the major program challenge, and hence emphasis, is addressing low temperature performance and service requirements, selected materials must perform over a broad temperature range in very aggressive chemical environments. As such, these factors will be of equal consideration in the selection of candidate replacement materials.",

Recessed cavities play an important role in many scramjet propulsion systems as a low drag flameholder.

A CFD design tool based on large eddy simulations (LES) will be developed for the design and analysis of the cavity flameholder. The development of the design tool and the flameholder will be carried out in parallel with dynamic pressure measurements spanning the length of the cavity using an optically interrogated MEMS based pressure sensor array. The proposed concept will lead to an LES based cavity design tool and rugged surface pressure mapping instrumentation with spatial and temporal resolution that is currently unavailable. The proposed LES/MEMS model for cavity flameholder design will allow a detailed analysis of highly turbulent unsteady flows that cannot be properly captured with traditional RANS methodologies, empirical models, or standard measurement techniques. The proposed model and instrumentation will be of great interest to scientists and engineers involved with the analysis and design of advanced propulsion components which are dominated by large scale turbulence and unsteady effects.",

The epoxy imparts strength, fluid resistance, and adhesion while the elastomer provides low temperature flexibility. The elastomer also acts as a reservoir for corrosion inhibitors and other functional components added to the primer. Chromate inhibitors will be replaced by new organic inhibitors that demonstrate comparable corrosion inhibition of Al 2024-T3 and Al 7075-T6. These inhibitors will partition into the elastomer and leach to active corrosion sites if the primer coating is damaged. In Phase I, primer formulations that exhibit the necessary flexural and corrosion resistant properties will be developed and characterized for ambient and low temperature flexibility, salt spray and filiform corrosion resistance. Collaboration with a coating manufacturer and aircraft company to conduct testing to appropriate Military and Federal standards is proposed. Phase II would involve refinement of primer formulations, address all aspects relevant to meeting Military Specifications and acceptance for use at depot facilities, as well as field-testing.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  Force protection can greatly benefit image understanding technologies.  In most battlefield scenarios, it is valuable to be able to assess the area of operation prior to deployment of troops.  Video sensors deployed in the field provide valuable visual information that can be used to develop strategies prior to sending in troops.  A major limitation of existing video sensors is field of view.  It is highly desirable to have sensors that provide  complete  coverage after deployment.  From this perspective, omni-directional video cameras present major advantages over conventional ones.  The 360 degree coverage provided by such a sensor enables a remote user to  look around  and assess the battlefield.  Today, the main drawback of omni-directional cameras  is their limited resolution.  Since a complete hemispherical fields is projected onto a single CCD detector, far away objects are only imaged onto a small numbers of pixels.  For instance, when a standard NTSC video camera is used in conjunction with omni-directional imaging optics, a human 50 meters away will appear within just 5-10 pixels in a typical omni-directional image.  This proposal is geared towards the development of high-resolution omni-directional cameras.  The implementation of such sensors requires not only the use of a high-definition video camera but also the design and fabrication of accompanying optics to generate the desired field of view.  Our optical design will be a catadioptric one, where mirrors are used in conjunction with lenses to project the large field of view onto a single planar image detector.  This design procedure will require the use of sophisticated optical design techniques.  In addition to the design of a high-definition omni-directional sensor, we propose the implementation of a series of low-level image processing and image understanding algorithms.  These algorithms will include real-time generation of perspective video, real-time tracking and monitoring of multiple moving objects, fast ego-motion estimation for applications where the omni-directional sensor is mounted on a moving platform, as well as higher-level algorithms for activity and object recognition.",

In modern warfare, a great deal of fire power is directed at a battle space compressed in space and  time. Assets such as cruise missiles and aircraft are concentrated on a relatively  small number of platforms. Thus, the complexity of mission planning is increased due  to: (i) the trend towards jointness and (ii) using missiles and aircraft missile systems that are sophisticated in their capabilities. This complexity renders  conventional mission planning systems inadequate to operational needs. Thus, the area  of mission and route planning is fertile for the application of genetic algorithms  and genetics based machine learning approaches. Phase I will demonstrate the  application of a genetics based route planner for the multiple-mission,  multiple-platforms scenario. The success of Phase I is largely assured by the  previous work done by the Scientific Systems and Boeing in applying genetic  algorithms to cruise missile route planning.

In spite of demonstrated advantages in high speed, low power-consumption and high accuracy, commercialization of superconducting electronic systems are retarded by fabrication technology limitations, such as low yield and uniformity. Modularization of a complex circuit into smaller blocks, fabricated on separate chips and mounted on a common carrier, circumvents this limitation and improves reliability. While individual circuit blocks have been demonstrated to operate at 20 Gb/s and beyond, present interchip data transmission rates limit operation of these large circuits to less than 5 GHz clock speed. In order to take full advantage of superconducting digital technology, interchip data rates above 20 Gb/s must be achieved. In Phase I, 20 Gb/s data transfer through non-superconducting solder bumps and passive transmission lines on the MCM carrier will be demonstrated, using digital logic to eliminate the need for amplification and avoid bandwidth limitations of transmission lines. In Phase II, HYPRES will increase this interconnect speed to 30 Gb/s and use this novel MCM technology to develop digital receiver components.",

At the same time, this new antenna (including electronics) will be designed for a small aperture, have reduced Radar Cross Section and minimum cost in commercial production quantities. This proposal demonstrates an in-depth understanding of the GPS system as it relates and responds to jamming and interference signals, and will highlight experience in antenna design, measurement and fabrication. MRC, allied with Compton Research, Inc., provides a unique capability to analyze, design, and in later phases, fabricate and measure new integrated GPS hardware. MRC is well known for its special purpose antenna design and fabrication, but MRC has also designed, built and tested large scale integrated electronics which in one instance is a GPS antijam filter. This effort is proposed to investigate antenna configurations given the satellite, GPS receiver and interfering signal spatial envelopes. An array of designs and cost tradeoffs will be delivered.",

This material can provide efficient conductive heat removal of the 3D segments for space, airborne and ground applications. The high conductivity and low CTE of the proposed material is ideal for many advanced packaging configurations such as multichip modules, high power processor integrated circuits and power converters. As in the rest of the electronics world, the range of applications and functions of spaceborne electronics is rapidly expanding. New applications like cellular phone systems, satellite TV links, and Global Positioning Units, as well as new technologies like multichip modules have increased the technical requirements of the electronics on satellites. Mission sophistication has increased dramatically for both commercial and government satellites, alike. Power requirements of a typical satellite launched even a few years ago were less than 8 kilowatts. Current systems will be deployed with up to 15 kilowatts. The proposed 3D packaging configuration uses a material system comprised of thermal pyrolytic graphite (TPG) encapsulated within the metal matrix composite AlSiC. Immediate payoffs include improved thermal performance, and significant weight reductions. These payoffs will allow for increased reliability and support",

Piezoceramic fiber composites are more desirable than other technologies in many transducer and actuator applications. ACI intends to adapt its piezoelectric fiber manufacturing process to form long lengths of single-crystal relaxor ferroelectric materials at reasonable cost. The proposed reseach is broken into three steps: 1) process chemical compatability studies and initial fiber spinning, 2) spinning trials for texturing and/or melt growth along the fiber axis and 3) prototype device development. Congruently melting materials (non-lead based) will be spun and continuously sintered in a melt-zone furnace that ACI developed to make high-temperature superconducting fiber. Incongruently melting materials (lead-based) will be melt-textured using procedures requiring a controlled-atmosphere, which ACI developed for monolithic HTS materials. During the research ACI will build fiber composite transducers for ultrasound and underwater acoustic applications and active fiber composites for actuator applications. By the end of Phase II ACI will have relaxor ferroelectric single-crystal fiber composite sales to its existing commercial and military customers.",

The proposed structure will withstand the hoop stress of the shot firing and the strain produced by the bending of the barrel. The strain limited fatigue property of the Ti/SiC at elevated temperature will be determined experimentally.

Combat system development efforts are able to exploit technology trends to rapidly improve performance. Although these efforts have and will continue to yield results which enable the fleet to maintain tactical superiority, improvements to the operator interface for these systems have not kept pace with the flood of raw data driven by new sensors and new processing techniques that have been made available for management and interpretation.

The proposed technique utilizes a high-resolution flat panel electronic x-ray detector to collect multiple images of the component using different source locations/angles for each image. The images are processed concurrently to permit viewing of the internal structure of the subject along any arbitrarily selected plane. A film-based predecessor to this electronic technique has been used successfully in a wide variety of applications but has been limited by the difficulties associated with exposing, processing, digitizing, registering and analyzing these film images. The full process often required several hours to complete. With the newly available large-area flat panel imagers, the prospect for rapid collection and processing of the images is now available. Many of the difficult steps of processing and registering the films are completely eliminated. Even the exposure of the images is made considerably quicker by the significantly more efficient flat-panel detectors. During the Phase I program a flat-panel detector will be integrated into a special test fixture and used to develop techniques to evaluate Navy-supplied elastomer test components.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  Low noise lasers are critical to the development of high performance analog photonic systems for large number of military and commercial systems.  Low noise DFB lasers have been the mainstay of the low noise laser applications in the past.  However, certain limitations make them less desirable for a number of applications which include the high relative intensity (RIN) noise dominating the noise performance, particularly at high frequencies.  They are also quite expensive.  A low cost noise laser is urgently needed for the antenna remoting and other applications for military as well as for commercial users.  Diode pumped solid state lasers (DPSS) appear to be the most promising candidate for low noise lasers.  Researchers have already demonstrated low noise lasers with noise of -165 dBc/Hz in the 1-20GHz range and it appears that better noise level can be achieved.  However, currently they are extremely expensive to manufacture.  The new technology of high power VCSELs which can be used as pump lasers will drastically change the picture by making it possible to manufacture ultra low noise solid state lasers at very low cost.  Princeton Electronic Systems (PES), which has a strong background on high power VSCELs and low noise transmitter development has teamed with Fluence Solutions which has a strong background on high power VCSELs and low noise transmitter development has teamed with Fluence Solutions which has a strong background in the area of diode pumped solid state lasers.  Together as a team they plan to develop a VCSEL pumped micro-laser which can be produced at a very low cost.  The micro-laser will have a low material cost and can be produced under $50 each in quantities of 1000.  In phase I of this program, PES proposes to demonstrate a low cost, ultra low noise DPSS micro-laser with output at 1550nm which can be used for RF as well as digital applications using 940nm VCSELs as the pump source.  PES will develop the high power VCSELs in phase I using the already developed epitaxial lift off technology and couple them with this will be a revolutionary product in the area of RF Photonics and telecommunications systems.  PES plans to commercialize the laser immediately after development.",

As the candidate for low-profile/conformal antennas for ultra-wide band airborne sensors, APTI proposes the Printed Circuit Fractal Loop (PCFL) Antennas.  The PCFL antenna has novel and other attractive features in addition to the wide band common to regular fractal antennas: 1) Constant phase center makes them a better wide band element for phased arrays or for designing circular polarized antennas for satellite communications; 2) Can be configured as a single ultra-wide band or multi-wide band antenna; 3) Easy to manufacture using printed circuit technology; 4) Readily conformal to airframe structure; 5) Low profile and light weight. Phase I study will focus on: 1) Numerical modeling and simple prototype validation of various designs; 2) Comparative and trade study of system and mechanical performance on different designs; 3) Optimized paper design for Phase II fabrication and testing.",

While the use of COTS products is not a new concept to the Navy, its application to highly elaborate weapon system developments such as the USS Virginia (SSN774) Class New Attack Submarine (NSSN) Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C3I) System surpasses earlier complexity. Adding to this complexity is the fact that the majority of the NSSN Non-Propulsion Electronics System (NPES) subsystems, of which the NSSN C3I subsystems are a subset, will be interfaced together for the first time at the Command and Control System Module Off-Hull Assembly and Test Site (COATS) in the shipyard at Electric Boat (EB). Following the I&T efforts at COATS the NPES subsystems will be installed on the submarine platform which will require some additional I&T effort. I&T at the COATS and on the NSSN platform will undoubtedly be fraught with technical and resource challenges that will demand new and innovative I&T techniques and concepts. The goal of this SBIR is to determine the I&T techniques and concepts that meet those challenges.",

The output power of a single fiber laser is however limited by intrinsic non-linear effects. We propose to coherently combine several fiber lasers in order to overcome such limitation. This work will build upon work by Rediker and Leger, and on the large effort in the computer field to have efficient fan-out of a laser beam. We will use a fan-in continuous phase grating to recombine the laser beams. Combination efficiency over 95% can theoretically be achieved for 3 beams, and over 99% for 9 beams. We will use our Excimer laser ablation system to fabricate the continuous phase grating in a 16-level approximation, thus allowing a quick turnaround for prototyping. The performance of the phase grating will first be evaluated in a fan-out configuration, and then in a fan-in configuration with a single fiber laser split into three beams. Three individual low-power fiber lasers will then be coherently combined. The coherence will be quantitatively evaluated and the influence of the individual fiber laser characteristics, such as frequency stability, will be analyzed in details.",

Such performance represents close to a tenfold improvement over existing technology; and is highly suited for analyzing precision components used in the manufacture of Interferometric Fiber Gyros, and is the requirement cited in the solicitation. The most unique aspect of the proposed design incorporates an optical pick-off method for precisely determining the zero path position of the scanning interferometer, which provides a twofold benefit: 1) Data collection for both scan directions becomes correlated which effectively doubles the measurement rate; and 2) Coherence averaging is enabled, providing the potential for measurement resolutions approaching 100 dB. The proposed White Light Analyzer will also be capable of providing high resolution coherence and optical spectrum measurements, where we project wavelength resolution of 0.002 nm and a high absolute accuracy. In Phase I, a breadboard system will be constructed to demonstrate the design performance claims. In Phase II, a full featured prototype system will be developed.",

With the rapid growth of the use of recombinant protein products, an automated system which would allow rapid screening of phage libraries would be of significant benefit to military and industrial researchers. Agave BioSystems proposes to develop and demonstrate an instrument capable of real time, automated screening of recombinant phage libraries. Two parallel technologies for marking display phage will evaluated each of which will help to report the presence of a bound phage. Key to detecting these marked bound phage is the development of a highly sensitive fluorometer based on an innovative and proprietary design. Coupled to optimized marker systems, this novel instrument would allow real time detection of a single phage binding event which would in turn allow capture of the desired bacteriophage.  BENEFITS:  This technology has potential use for drug and vaccine discovery, diagnosis, and resistance monitoring for infectious diseases. By using biomolecules for targets of commercial interest, low-cost, portable diagnostic equipment will be developed. Due to the broad range of applications, this technology is expected to have a major impact on the large medical research and clinical markets.",

The SAL will withstand 250 W while occupying no more space than the present limiter. More than twice as much power has to be transferred to the heat sink through a limiter with the same foot print as the present CEC limiter. This will be accomplished by designing the limiter from silicon carbide (SiC). The high thermal conductivity and high operating temperature of SiC solves the heat-transfer problem. To avoid problems experienced by others using bipolar SiC devices, Mission Research Corporation will design the limiter with n-type field-effect transistors (FETs). A working prototype will be made with chip and wire technology and tested for feasibility. We have successfully performed this type of design in gallium arsenide (GAL) and are presently teamed with Raytheon to develop and market a commercial product. The SAL approach can be used to design compact limiters for any system. The flexibility of the FET circuit can be utilized to design limiters with adjustable insertion loss for avoiding pulsed interference; hence the acronym SAL for SiC Adjustable Limiter. Since the field-effect transistor is amenable to monolithic integrated circuit techniques, this work will set the stage for the production of integrated receiver front ends when SiC technology matures sufficiently to support low-noise amplifier design.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  A potentially efficient, tunable laser is proposed that, can, in principle, span the 2.8 to 3.4 micron wavelength range, a technically challenging area for atmospheric constituents and coherent wind measurements.  The concept is based on a BaY2F8 crystal co-doped with thulium and dysprosium.  Promising recent spectroscopic and dynamic measurements indicate excellent prospects for efficient energy transfer between the Tm3+ and the Dy3+ ions, since thulium absorbs in a region accessible to standard semiconductor arrays.  The proposed laser offers, for the first time, the promise of a diode pumpable, direct, tunable emission in the 3 micron spectral region.  The primary goal for this Phase I project is to demonstrate lasing from Tm,Dy:BaYF crystals pumped at around 800 nm.  Several crystals will be grown to determine the effect of different ion concentrations on crystal level dynamics and multiphonon relaxation processes, followed by selection of samples with the most promising compositions for laser experiments.  Techniques demonstrated with existing Ho,Tm:YLF lasers will be considered to address issues of power scaling and/or narrow-band operation. In addition, a new laser material, with even lower phonon energies than BYF, Dy: NaYF4 will be evaluated",

These methods however are plagued by significant processing problems, the most notable of which are forging strain cracks and loss of dimensional integrity using high temperature liquid phase sintering (LFS). Solid state densification via a well established and more flexible F/M forging route, The Coercion Technology, has emerged as an enabling technology capable of producing fully dense, near-net-shape components at cycle times as low as 3 to 5 minutes.

Although many technologies already exist for displaying information, the size of these displays is currently limited by the power needed to drive the displays and can not be easily scaled up in size.  Moreover, the displays are not very flexible.  Work has been done to produce better conducting thin films (such as indium-tin-oxice) that are transparent but higher conductivity is needed and these films tend to be very brittle.  Recent experimental results demonstrate that photonic bandgap materials can provide a means for producing highly conducting transparent metals with sheet resistance less than 0.2 ohms per square and better than 70% transmissive in the visible waveband.  These materials can be readily combined with state of the art polymer processing techniques to provide a viable method for producing the thin, flexible, optically transparent conducting sheets required for both military and commercial display systems.  The research proposed here will address this opportunity and demonstrate the ability to combine metals with optical devices that previously were thought impossible.",

The algorithm we propose is conceptually founded on wavelet techniques. We will take advantage of the fact that the wavelet representation of the IR spectrum offers greater flexibility in enhancing low signal-to-noise ratios because the wavelet naturally resolves noise and spectral features into different domains. The algorithm itself is based on work described in Ref. [1], where an advanced wavelet technique is used to denoise astronomical spectra and remarkably recovers weak signal features that are drowned in noise so as not to be seen in the spectrum. In addition, the FTIR application of remote sensing is generally performed in a nonlinear environment due to dynamic background and instrumentation fluctuations. We propose the testing of wavelet pattern classification algorithms to aid in the identification of chemical compounds in this environment. In Phase II, algorithms, techniques, and procedures developed and demonstrated during Phase I will be optimized, implemented, and tested on a computer platform that runs ORINCON's commercial, real-time signal processing software.

These vehicles (as well as other tactical aircraft) use serpentine inlets to improve the stealth characteristics of the plane. Unfortunately, these serpentine ducts cause flow separation and increase the distortion at the engine and reduce its stability and performance. In this research program, fluidic actuators will be used for active flow control to prevent flow separation in serpentine gas turbine inlet ducts. Miniature ejector pumps, operated by bleeding high-pressure air from the engine, will provide boundary layer suction and blowing near the separation-prone areas in the inlet. An innovative approach of using MEMS-based microphones flush-mounted on the internal surface of the inlet to detect separated flow will be used to provide the error signal for the controller. Active control will then be used to operate miniature ejector pumps to ensure that the section/blowing scheme is most efficiently applied and that the maximum system benefit can be achieved. Recent experiments at Techsburg have demonstrated that boundary layer suction near separation-prone areas on gas turbine stator vanes can reduce the flow separation and the losses across the blade by as much as 40 percent. In addition, personnel at Techsburg have coupled active control with MEMS-based microvalves to reduce high-cycle fatigue (HCF) in gas turbine engines. Noise reductions of 10 dB were recorded. Using active flow control in UAV inlets will significantly improve the engine performance that can lead to improved speed, maneuverability, range, and survivability.",

Small detection ranges limit the detectability of the field. As detections occur in the field, detections are transmitted acoustically to a master node. Both detection processing and acoustic communication drain a node's battery. In order to maximize field life, an approach must be developed to control detector thresholds and acoustic communication routing, as well as the initial placement of the field. To address these problems, ORINCON proposes the development of an adaptive threshold control scheme. This technique will minimize the power consumption while still maintaining the field-level probability of detection. Acoustic communication routing of the field will also be accomplished to minimize power consumption and therefore extend the life of the field. The control law to be developed is based on two approaches, evolutionary programming and integer programming. At the end of the Phase I effort, ORINCON will demonstrate these techniques in the Deployable Autonomous Distributed System (DADS) prototype master node for testing and evaluation in the system.",

A technology for accurate untethered tracking of several users within a large immersive display is needed to fully unlock their potential for interactive exploration.  InterSense proposes to develop improved technology for tracking head and body position inside of immersive projection environments by extending our previously-demonstrated ConstellationT motion tracking system.  ConstellationT uses innovative adaptive sensor fusion algorithms to optimally blend time-of-flight ultrasonic range measurements with angular rate and linear acceleration data from a proprietary micro-miniature inertial sensing device called the InertiaCubeT.  The ConstellationT is a cost-effective, proven technology that delivers sub-centimeter accuracy over a scaleable tracking volume (up to the size of a whole building), with robustness superior to single-technology solutions.  In the phase I research, we will analyze techniques for tracking multiple body parts of multiple users,  and build a prototype system to demonstrate operation in a projective display environment.   Our approach will provide precise, low-latency, 6-DOF tracking of multiple users in a spatially immersive display of any size with no sensitivity to metallic or electromagnetic interference and minimal user encumbrance or line-of-sight constraints.",

The element would be placed at several locations on the satellite. Antenna architectures, element location, and beam control are discussed, with advantages of several architectures compared.

Inversion of ownship and/or bistatic/multistatic transmissions for ocean bottom properties can provide much more accurate information about the acoustic environment. This information can then be used in optimizing the use of the active sonar system, in essence, tuning the sonar for the environment. Recent advances in inversion techniques, specifically Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA), have made these techniques tactically viable tools by significantly increasing their speed. PSI proposes to implement the ASA algorithm with current transmission loss and bottom reverberation models to develop a set of tactical tools. Each of these inversions will characterize the ocean bottom in terms of Navy standard parameters. The use of Navy standard parameters allows the immediate use of these values in performance prediction models and their use in a network-centric environment among different combatants.",

This mapping can be used to reconstruct higher resolution mages from the observed low resolution frames thereby increasing the optical system resolution without changing the hardware. To be useful under operational conditions, the microscanning algorithms must work in real-time. Presently employed registration and reconstruction algorithms use iterations that slow the process down. The goal of this project is to increase the speed of the algorithms by removing the iterations. This will be accomplished by identifying local constraints that conserve the image properties. We have already successfully employed local constraints to remove the interations from segmented adaptive optics control algorithms. To further increase the speed of the microscanning process, we will also parallelize the non-iterative image registration algorithm. We will demonstrate that the parallel computation is well suited to handle cases where the images contain moving objects. Finally, we will develop a completely new non-iterative approach to microscanning processing based on orthonormal scaled functions or wavelets as apodization functions for the detector array. .",

Fluorescent cooling occurs when a material absorbs radiation at one wavelength and fluoresces at a shorter wavelength. This is known as anti-stokes fluorescence. The difference is photon energy is made up of energy removed from the upper state thermal bands. Thus the material cools. Anti-stokes fluorescent cooling in solids has been demonstrated by means of atomic anti-stokes fluorescence in Yb+3 doped glass. However molecular systems--could be much more efficient than atomic systems if problems with long spontaneous lifetimes can be overcome. This can be done by means of intramolecular conversion of tautomers or by near resonance coupling of paired molecular systems. Such molecular systems could be an order of magnitude more efficient than atomic systems and the working materials fabricated at low cost.  BENEFITS:  Development of optical cooling will allow non-refrigerant cooling of detectors and integrated circuits.",

Pilot disorientation is a disturbingly frequent phenomenon for military, commercial and civilian pilots. Pilot disorientation costs the U.S. military about 30 lives and over $300 million in lost aircraft annually. Speculation surrounding the recent crash of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s Piper Saratoga aircraft has, again, attributed the tragedy to pilot disorientation. Pilot disorientation generally occurs when pilots incorrectly perceive attitude, altitude, and/or motion when visual information is compromised, either through temporary distractions, increased workload, or reduced visibility. Current research at the Naval Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory is focused on developing a Tactile Situational Awareness System (TSAS) which, when linked to the aircraft's instruments, will provide attitude and spatial orientation awareness to the pilot. TSAS will use a number of tactile transducers (tactors) that are placed in arrays surrounding the torso. To assist this development, Foster-Miller will develop a garment into which the tactor arrays will be incorporated. The garment will take the form of a full torso suit which will extend from the mid-thigh to the neck, including the upper arms. The tactor suit will be designed to conform to the human torso in a uniform manner.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  Painted coatings are not perfect and their integrity is constantly challenged. During everyday use, scratches or scribes are often introduced into a coating. Where this occurs, the underlying metal is exposed directly to the environment and this favors accelerated corrosion. Thus, there is a need for so-called smart coatings that can spontaneously heal themselves wherever they are damaged. Incorporation of microcapsules loaded with a multifunctional corrosion inhibitor into a coating formulation offers this possibility. Wherever such a coating is scratched or scribed, the microcapsules are designed to rupture and release their corrosion inhibitor contents to cover the damaged area thereby providing corrosion protection to this area. The overall goal of the proposed program is to develop an effective corrosion inhibiting coating system for outdoor use on steel enclosed appliances and equipment. The coating system will be based upon a primer that contains a microencapsulated corrosion- inhibiting liquid formulation. Variables associated with microcapsule parameters and coating parameters will be investigated. Salt spray and electrochemical characterization of coatings will be conducted to assess the efficacy of the self-healing coatings.  BENEFITS:  The US Army estimates that the cost for painting/depainting operations is $2 billion per year. In addition, Navy and Air Force coating requirements for steel and aluminum are significant dollar volume. In the consumer area, a",

Since the TWCP process was developed in the 1970's, there have been significant advances in composite processing methodology such that large complex parts can be made near net shape by semi-automated techniques resulting in improved uniformity and reproducibility.  Despite these advances, a new process has not been qualified for TWCP becuase of the high cost of qualification.  The dwindling supply of qualified rayon fiber affords an excellent opportunity to develop a new SOTA process.  This program will quantify cost reductions afforded by advances in fabrication technology to the existing process as wll as from alternatives and prioritize them on a cost/performance basis.  The Phase I effort will assume low thermal conductivity PAN-based carbon fibers as rayon replacement materials.  Phase I will produce a plan for Phase II, to evaluate high priority alternative heatshield fabrication process(es). This program will validate the cost reduction estimates and include hardware fabrication for test evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  We describe a new approach for identification and location of buried non-metallic mines from backscatter data from a wide-footprint microwave source.  A method based on the Feynman diagram model is described that permits discrimination between multiply scattered field data and data arising fro discrete scatterers such as mines.  The limited backscatter data associated with discrete but multiply scattering objects is then processed using a nonlinear filter to remove multiple scattering effects.  The resulting poorly resolved estimate for each discrete object is further processed using our spectral estimation technique, the Prior Discrete Fourier Transform (PDFT).  This technique requires that some prior knowledge about the targets, i.e. size, approximate shape. Using this PDFT information allows discrimination between targets based on a simple calculation of the magnitude of the coefficients of the PDFT estimate derived from each possible choice of prior knowledge.  In Phase I we propose to develop the first version of a complete software package enabling mine detection based on these models. We will conduct trials of the effectiveness of our approach applied to simulated and real data. We will specify a complete system, including the required radar hardware and signal processing capability, to be constructed and tested in Phase II.

Such coating of aircraft fuselage, supersonic aircraft fuel tanks, cryogenic containers and munitions packages not only reduces the need for elaborate safety back-up systems, but also cuts down on wastes. The minimum general requirements for TEBCs and associated materials are: (i) lightweight, (ii) minimum bulk, (iii) very low thermal conductivity, and (iv) radiation resistance. Other special requirements include fluid and humidity resistance, adherence, low gloss in visible wavelengths, and reasonable electrical conductivity.

The studies and assessments to date have focused on abnormal environments initiated by accidents during normal peacetime military operations.  These studies have identified some abnormal environments in which disposal is likely to occur.  These environments can be initiated by accident or intentionally by terrorists.  Dispersal by intentional means is likely to have the same health and political consequences with respect to public consequences as dispersal by accidental means.  Phase I research will develop a methodology to assess intentional actions such that the quantified risk of these actions is comparable with the risk quantified by accepted methods for accidents.  The specific objectives are to assess the likelihood and effectiveness of a terrorist attack and support their integration into DTRA's Nuclear Weapon System Safety Assessment.",

Weeks are often involved with the construction of a single threat scenario, and once constructed, the scenario becomes a static sequence of actions applied against the defense system in a software-based simulation.  What is required is a system capable of rapid generation, injection and adjustment of simulated threats into a BMC3 system exercise.  Such a system would provide an efficient mechanism through which a human operator, aware of the current state (and weaknesses) of the defense system under test and charged with the task of thwarting it, could rapidly inject or adjust a threat in an attempt to overcome the system.  Such testing is necessary to insure the robustness of the BMC3 system. Envisage shall design and develop what will hereafter be referred to as the Rapid Threat Deployment and Simulation (RTDS) system.  Using COTS speech recognition software and leveraging off of existing corporate expertise in the areas of visualization and computer graphics, the system will integrate graphical data displays, high-level natural language processing and ballistic flight models to allow an operator to verbally specify, inject and adjust simulated threat entities in real-time.",

While providing high spectral resolution and wide wavelength coverage, each component of the spectrometer occupies less than a 1x2x0.3mn3 space thereby offering orders of magnitude advantage in weight, size and scanning speed over competing technologies, such as rotating gratings or diode array spectrometers.  The actual instrument size, cost and weight will be limited by the size of multi-chip-module circuit and the liquid crystal display that control analyze and display the measured data.  A successful two-Phase program will result in an instrument that could be manufactured inexpensively for applications ranging from measuring of toxic chemicals in the battlefield to analysis of blood chemicals and low-cost monitoring of volatile gases in petrochemical industries.  In Phase I, we will develop and demonstrate the key MEMs structure, design the controller electronics, and develop a comprehensive integration plan to result in a complete chemometric spectrometer instrument by the end of Phase II.

Further miniaturization of the electrochemical part is expected to enable on-chip integration of the sensors. The result will be a highly portable microanalytical sensor system with fast response time and high selectivity.  It is proposed to use arrays of carbon nanofibers as ultimate nanosize electrodes. The fibers can be produced well aligned and with good mechanical strength on a variety of substrates. MER's experience in the fabrication and tailoring of carbon nanofibers will be utilized to produce nanofiber structures, which meet the requirements for nanoelectrode arrays. Existing electronic designs will be used to interface the microelectrode arrays and to obtain electrochemical data. Redox modifying compounds will be immobilized on the electrode surface to improve selectivity and sensitivity of the electrode arrays towards biological agents.  BENEFITS:  Besides an improvement of the safety of battlefield personnel, handheld biosensors with fast response time and good selectivity could be used in clinical health care applications, pharmaceutical production and in agricultural applications.

        "abstract": "Not Available  Since the Cold War the trend in military operations has increasingly moved toward Operations Other Than War (OOTW). However, military doctrine, practice and training have focused primarily on traditional combat operations, which differ fundamentally from OOTW. One requirement for training the Air Force with skills necessary for successful operation in OOTW environments is to understand the breath of OOTW requirements and how they differ from war-fighting situations. In the history of military operations, the frequency of OOTWs has been substantially lower than that of combat operations, making every OOTW a significant and critical data point. The goal of the proposed effort is help the U.S. Air Force understand and meet the unique training needs that OOTW impose. The opportunity with this proposal is to take advantage of three recent developments what will impact Air Force training for OOTW: 1) the emergence of the Naturalistic Decision Making framework using Cognitive Task Analysis to understand how people make decisions; 2) the work of Miller and Zsambok (1997) defining the unique cognitive demands of Commanders of OOTW; and 3) the development of a new approach to training skills in decision making called Decision Skills Training (DST).",
