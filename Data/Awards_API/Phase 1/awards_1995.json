        "abstract": "Significant deficiencies exist in the laser source technology for IRCM, specifically in the limited pulse rep-rate capability, limited average power output and capability to be transitioned to field environments. We propose a diode pumped solid state Er,Ho:YSGG laser and optical parametric oscillator to resolve these deficiencies. This laser has a potential dual use market in micro-surgery where the surrounding heat affected zone must be minimized. This laser is well suited for micro surgery due to its strong absorption in tissue and its potential to be delivered via an optical fiber. The primary innovation in the laser is the use of a hohnuim co-dopant to deactivate the erbium lower laser level, enabling the erbium doping concentration to be reduced. The co-dopant enables high rep rate Q-switching by deactivating the lower laser level and improved output power scaling compared to non co-doped erbium compounds due to the larger thermal conductivity with lower erbium doping concentration. The 2.7 gm output from the laser can be used to pump existing OPO crystals where they have low bulk absorption compared to 1 and 2 gm pumping and should therefore have improved mid-IR output power and rep-rate scaling.",

Provide an adjunct to on-line calibration that would assist in timing the replacement of items.  iii. Identify test sites and recruiters that are associated with high rates of item compromise.  iv. Improve accuary of measurement of normal examinees by utilizing ancillary information such as frequency of item usage and likelihood of item compromise in the examinee's testing site.  These objectives are to be achieved by modeling the probability that an item has been compromised and the probability that a particular examinee has previewed one or more items.  The parameters of the models are to be estimated from both group and individual data.  Accuracy of estimation is to be improved by explicitly incorporating information about test compromise in the calculation of the individual examinee's posterior ability distribution.  Statistical tests are to be used to identify compromised items.  Statistical tests and estimated distributions of aberrance are to be used to identify test sites and recruiters involved in test compromise.",

However, in order to compete with the increasing numbr of offshore laboratories, U.S. micropropagators must produce higher quality plants more efficiently.  The goal of this project is to develop automatic grading technology that will reduce production costs, improve quality, and provide a key component for expansion into the $792 million market for agricultural and forestry starter plants.  Specifically, machine vision and mass based measurements of unrooted microcuttings, the primary product from a tissue culture laboratory, will be used to grade microcuttings into groups which will mature more predictably and uniformly in the greenhouse.  Phase I will concentrate on two issues critical to the success of automated grading.  First, the capability to automatically predict grow out responses of stage 2, unrooted microcuttings will be developed, and second, the economic feasibility of this technology will be established.  Phase II will build upon the results of Phase I by developing a grading system for testing and evaluation in a commercial, production environment.  A consortium of micropropagation laboratories will be established to fund Phase III which will complete the commercialization of this technology.",

In addition, the image sensors will be developed for the dual-use application of ultraviolet imaging. The sensor technology has dual-use applications for both BMDO and commercial applications. The BMDO application concerns an ultraviolet sensor array for detection of missile plumes. The commercial application concerns a digital x-ray mammography imager.

Metal, glass, and filler impurities are separated from the hydrocarbons during the process and can be reclaimed or landfilled.  A related technology has been demonstrated on a large scale (100 tons/day) for recycling used tires.  For application to transparency materials, conversion products of representative scrap transparencies will be determined using a continuous feed laboratory-scale reactor, product resale markets will be identified, and the economics of a large-scale tertiary recycling operation will be estimated.

In addition, rural residents are faced with a constant maintenance problem from winter snow plows, vandals, and vehicle impacts.

The mailbox is a single unit design combining box and post into a unitized device that eliminates separation.  The lightweight plastic devices has a davit shaped post section that allows the box to swing clear of impacts from cars and plows.  Adian has presented a logical development plan leading to a prototype device in Phase I.",

        "abstract": "Adroit Systems, Inc. (ASI) is proposing to develop the concept of a geometric vector that is updated by deeply integrated avionics sensor data.  Deep integration is a technique of sensor fusion that promises greater performance and robustness than possible with cascaded frameworks.  Many of today's federated avionics sensor suites do not provide outputs that facilitate deep integration. The solution is to develop a vector of platform based geometric quantities such as position, velocity, attitude and time, and update this vector with raw information obtained from avionics sensors.  ASI intends to investigate this problem as it relates to military aircraft missions, specifically the multiple platform, multiple target sensor-to-shooter problem.  Phase I will begin with an investigation into the impact various avionics sensors have on geometric vector.  The second part of Phase I will be a study into how the geometric vector will benefit various airborne military missions in the multiple platform, multiple target scenario.  This deep integration architecture will lead to better accuracy, robustness, timeliness, and resource use in the sensor-to-shooter problem.",

In Phase I, chemical precursors and a deposition process specifically tailored to BBO will produce high quality epitaxial thin films for nonlinear optical waveguides and give direction for commercial device fabrication. In a joint program with Illinois Institute of Technology, SHG measurements will be made to assess the optical performance of the films. In Phase II, thin-film deposition will be optimized to achieve device-quality BBO, concurrent with the fabrication and testing of optical waveguides.

A novel aspect of our approach is the use of SiC as a substrate for these devices, which will both improve the quality of the nitride layers used in the detector, as well as permit on-chip integration of electronics and LEDs to increase sensor functionality.  The advantage of direct semiconductor detectors over other detection methods include increased performance, lower cost, smaller size and weight, increased reliability and reduced temperature sensitivity. Phase I will develop UV detectors based on (In,Ga)N that are sensitive to radiation in the 200-300nm and 310-390nm range. Phase II will extend this work to monolithically integrate an array of multi-spectral detectors on a single chip and examine integration of sensors and electronics on the same chip. The development of GaN-based UV detectors and arrays will greatly simplify UV monitoring in a wide range of applications including fire detection, pollution monitoring, solar UV monitoring, burner monitoring in gas turbines, and flame detection in furnaces and for fire detection. GaN materials and devices also has great potential for use in full color displays and high temperature.",

Typically these devices use expensive bulk ceramics that result in high cost and difficult device integration.  Ceramic materials in the PbLaZrTiO3 (PLZT) family of compounds show a unique combination of high transparency, large electrooptic effects and exceptional speed.  Combined with ATM's ability to produce high quality PLZT thin films by MOCVD, we believe that SLM's with frame rates higher than 1MHz can be fabricated at a fraction of the cost of currently available low performance devices.  In Phase I we will demonstrate the feasibility of a high deposition rate process for PLZT with electrooptic properties sufficient to enable operation at full contrast at less than 35V.  Phase II will focus on integration of MOCVD PLZT with silicon drive electronics, to produce monolithic commercially available spatial light modulator operating at above 1MHz.  Additionally ATM will market a \"turn-key\" process to fabricate thin, high quality PLT films for integrated electro-optics.",

Until recently, FRAMs have relied on lead zirconate titanate (PZT) as the storage material. However, a new class of materials promises to offer higher device reliability and easier integration into existing technologies. SrBi2Ta209 has been identified as a material of choice for this application, but current deposition technologies require high temperature post-anneals to bring about acceptable ferroelectric properties. Phase I will develop new MOCVD techniques to deposit SrBi2Ta209 at reduced temperatures. Metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) represents an optimum solution because it yields microcrystalline material of high quality, has high deposition rates, produces conformal coatings, and scales well to large areas. SrBi2Ta209 FRAMs have immediate military application for high radiation environments such as missile guidance systems and space systems. For the commercial market, the initial introduction at low device densities would impact existing EEPROM markets and new markets in identification tags for consumer goods. High density devices used in telecommunications will follow.",

        "abstract": "Functional gradient materials (FGMs) have a microstructurally graded transition in composition (e.g. zirconia to a nickel based superalloy). The graded transition eliminates problems associated with a discrete interface such as poor mechanical strength and transport losses. They are being actively pursued by the engineering community, particularly in Japan, as a means of taking advantage of two different materials within the same monolithic body. A versatile process for preparing FGMs is under development at ACR. The process is based on a solid freeforming (SFF) process from a computer virtual image. A solid body is built up from a polymerizable suspension which is deposited from a moving nozzle. The suspension comprises of a mixture of two streams fed from two computer-controlled extruders through a static mixer. The freeformed body is then processed like a traditional ceramic or powdered metallurgy green body. In Phase I the current method will be extended to produce large, \"6x6\", plates of FGMs. This will involve the use of a dual-headed extruder to fill molds with metal and ceramic gel-casting formulations. Of particular interest in Phase I will be the preparation of unique structural materials designed either to have outstanding thermal protection or wear resistance. Materials systems that will be investigated include combinations of alumina, partially stabilized zirconia, titanium carbide, titanium diboride, tungsten carbide, stainless steel, Inconel X and NiAl. This technology has potential for producing large ??Ms by a novel, flexible and rapid manufacturing technique. Such a method will have important ramifications allowing various combinations of ceramics and metals to be quickly evaluated and introduced as tailored materials for numerous defense and commercial applications.",

ACR has already developed extensive software and hardware capability for solid freeform fabrication.  Biopolymers that are capable of thermal gelation have tremendous potential in freeforming ceramics.  They solidify upon cooling without the use of chemical additives and at lower concentrations than any other synthetic gelling agents.  The use of very low concentrations of gelling agents will enable slurries to be prepared with very high ceramic solids loadings, ensuring ready densification and low shrinkage in the final fired part.  In the Phase I program slurry optimization and the development of a freeforming methodology will be carried out.  Experimental A1203 parts will be freeformed and mechanically tested.",

The new FET technology promises to eliminate the Narrow Channel Effect (NCE) which is one of the primary factors limiting the minimum power consumption of VLSI circuits.  By eliminating the NCE, we may scale the device size dramatically and reduce the power consumption by an order of magnitude.  Specifically, this project will assess the feasibility to fabricate p-channel 2-D MESFET devices, develop p-channel device models and incorporate these models into an advanced SPICE package (AIM-SPICE), simulate complementary 2-D MESFET circuits, and compare the predicted performance with the existing complementary FET technologies.  We will also analyze the primary factors limiting the noise margins at low power supplies, establish the minimum required bias voltage for reliable operation, and analyze the factors determining the threshold voltage changes from device to device as well as other factors which may limit the yield and integration scale.",

The technique now is in use to measure pO2 in tissues in animals and is being developed for conventional use in patients.  EPR oximetry offers the advantage of high sensitiity (about one torr or less), accuracy, simplicity, rapid measurements and indefinite repeatability.  The method is based on the response of certain paramagnetic materils to the presence of molecular oxygen,  The EPR spectra can be obtained from several sites simultaneously.  The task in Phase I would be to demonstrate the feasibility of converting the technology to a portable form suitable for the proposed uses.  In Phase II, a working prototype suitable for initial production will be developed.  It is anticipated that the developments will have widespread use for the military, for emergency medicine in general and for non-medical measurements of pO2.",

These pyroelectric materials will be ferroelectric metal-oxides and hence have very large electric polarizations. Epitaxial films ensure low dielectric noise, and allow photolithographic array patterning. They will function as sensitive and fast infrared detectors, without cooling, for applications over the 2 to 20-micron wavelength range, including thermal imaging. Both recent market demands for arrays of IR detectors (focal plane arrays), and the market's insistence on lowering costs to bring arrays into the range of commercial applications, are pulling hard for new technology development. AFR, Inc. brings extensive experience with epitaxial oxide-film fabrication and thermal infrared detector design and fabrication, including micromachining. The later will utilize silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer technology to make possible ultrathin and uniform silicon membranes. Epitaxial conducting-oxide electrodes are available for use with the epitaxial oxide ferroelectrics and silicon substrates. The proposed uncooled IR arrays will respond directly to demand that is building rapidly in the commercial markets, namely that for thermal imaging across the dual bands of the mid-IR. Applications for these sensor devices include: factories and manufacturing monitoring, community and security services, transportation systems, and energy and environmental surveying.",

Coalburning power plants, for example, have a notorious reputation for spewing outflue gas particles originating from the mineral mater in the coal.  These fluegas particles (10 microns in diameter) must be characterized for two reasons:1) to determine their potential as toxic air emissions; and 2) to determine thefeasibility for controlling the risk.  This proposal offers the development ofan instrument that can characterize the particles in flue gases in-situ for sizedistribution, concentration, and composition.  The instrument will utilizeFourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) transmission spectroscopy to measure infraredextinction as a function of wavelength in the forward direction.  The measurementis wavelength dependent with regards to the scattering and adsorption componentsof extinction.  Therefore, Mie theory analysis can be utilized to interpret thespectral data for particle size distribution and concentration.  Composition isobtained by analysis of absorption band position.  Phase I will demonstrate fluegas particle characterization by FT-IR measurements of respirable ash in alaboratory suspension cell.  Phase II will develop a prototype instrument thatwill be tested on a power plant flue.

        "abstract": "Microscopic measurement of surface topography is a continuing need in microfabrication technology and materials research.  The aim of this research is to adapt the scanning electron microscope (SEM) to the quantitative measurement of a wide range of surface structures.  The SEM is a widely used measurement tool in materials science and semiconductor fabrication.  The SEM's strength is that it provides high resolution images which often have a three dimensional appearance.  Its weakness is that highly precise three dimensional measurements are difficult or impossible even with stereo techniques.  In addition the accuracy of two dimensional measurement is degraded by the reliance of intensity profiles to determine the location of edges.\n\nThe proposed research will examine the feasibility of using structured illumination to generate SEM images that provide purely topographical information while maintaining the conditions useful for normal viewing as well.  In this technique the SEM projects a known pattern on the specimen.  The beam either etches the surface or promotes a deposition process.  The patterned surface is viewed in the SEM from a different angle of incidence.  The detected pattern is a direct measure of the topography of the specimen surface.  The accuracy of the measurement depends only on the quality of the generated pattern and the SEM image.  As long as the pattern is detectable, accuracy is independent of composition and the multitude of contrast mechanisms in the SEM.  In addition, the proposed device would be cost effective and provide easily interpretable data that would make it suitable for widespread use.",

        "abstract": "A rang  of AF activities generate wastewater containing oily substances, emulsion=stabilizing agents, and insoluble materials, including Aqueous, Film-Forming Foam (AFFF).  US AF is searching for a cost effective method to handle the problem.  This problem in reality refers to two issues:  a) removal of oil from wastewater and b) removal of AFFF from the wastewater.  The AFFF is a fire-fighting foaming chemical.  The wastewater containing residual oil, combustion products and AFFF can not be discharged into municipal sewer, due to the presence of considerable amounts of organic chemicals.  Further, due to the presence of AFFF, uncontrollable foam will be generated on the subsequent processing of the sewage water which involves aeration and other processes. The research project is challenging task.  Removal of oil and solvents from various streams is an extremely difficult task. Various technologies available today including bio-technologies can only offer for limited separation efficiency and a high equipment and processing cost.  A novel technology, air-sparged hydrocyclone technology, for removing oil and AFFF from wastewater is proposed. This is a newly developed technology by Advanced Processing Technologies, Inc. and it may provide an excellent opportunity to solve the problem.  The technology can perform oil and AFFF separation from wastewater in a matter of less than a second, as demonstrated by previous preliminary test work.  The Phase I test program will consist of an exploratory series of flotation tests with 2-inch air-sparged hydrocyclone unit and other required associated analytical and surface chemistry studies.",

The quality of these carrots is much poorer than the processors desire, and they must pay a premium price for the out-of-season produce.  Their goal is to store locally grown, lower-cost carrots through winter and then use this produce in place of the more expensive carrots from the South and West.  However, the longest time carrots can consistently be stored is still only five months.  Therefore, the processors can store fall-harvested carrots only until March, suffering appreciable losses of 40 to 50% and significant degradation in quality due to spoilage.\n\nThis proposal is concerned with the long-term storage (ten months) of carrots (Daucus carota).  Advanced Seed Technology (AST) believes strongly that in-ground storage followed by refrigerated storage will result in a cost-effective method by which sweeter tasting, superior quality, locally grown carrots can be supplied to Midwest processors in the spring and summer when prices are at premium levels.  Compared to our competitors, our Midwest-based operations will be able to take advantage of much lower storage and transportation costs.",

Additionally, the development of smart mines poses an interesting challenge to minefield control and application through the use of decision aids.  Technology development is needed to address methodologies for development of distributed, real-time expert system decision aids and specific algorithmic issues associated with their development and evaluation.  A common need in any direct/indirect fire system and smart mine field control decision aid suite is a tactical situation assessment (TSA) module which rapidly assesses available information, feeds subordinate modules actionable data, and presents recommendations as appropriate.

The number of program subroutines that are truly generic (and therefore applicable across all applications) is limited.  However, there are specific applications that are required by many organizations, albeit with a set of constraints specific to each organization.  This project proposes to design a tool set to facilitate reuse in the development of software systems.  The technical approach focuses on the domain-oriented development of software systems that belong to a common class, proposing to build models of both the domain requirements and features, to develop a features-to-requirements mapping, to design both a derivation protocol and checks for completeness and consistency, and to develop a browsing mechanism to assist developers.  Attainment of these objectives will provide a solid foundation for implementation of a truly innovative way to develop software throughout the life cycle.  When implemented, the tool set will be made commercially available to the many organizations that wish to build software systems that are valid, reliable, and derivable at a cost projected to be two orders of magnitude less than current software development methods.",

Improved depiction of these storms will aid nowcasting in support of execution.of operations at sea and fore- casting of the evolution of these storms in support of planning. However, SSM/I data as well as many other satellite data have only small impacts on the forecasts and analyses of the operational meteorological centers. At many centers the SSM/I data are not currently used. The SSM/I data has great potential for monitoring and depicting marine storms. To attain this potential we propose a novel technique for assimilating SSM/I observa- tions of marine atmospheric storms. In plain terms we propose to match the observ- able features, shifting the short term forecast (or background) of the data assimila- tion system to best match the available satellite data. Our approach to this problem is technically a novel characterization of errors for numerical weather predictions. The basic idea is to characterize forecast errors by a distortion, composed of continuous displacement and amplification fields. We will apply these concepts to SSM/I observations of precipitable water and surface wind speed. These data are ideal for pinpointing the location and structure of marine storms. We will develop and test algorithms for a variational analysis method to make use of these data for initializing numerical forecasts of these storms.",

Such systems have been discussed, but none have been realized yet because of technology and cost considerations. Such a satellite would have enormous commercial potential in applications including communications and remote sensing both because its launch cost as a piggyback is negligible, and the highly integrated, commercial style of construction similar to portable CD players and cellular phones, allows recurring cost 1% to 5% of existing low cost, miniature satellites.  By applying innovative design and development methods which have already been proven in the commercial sector and available technology, such a system is now feasible, and can be constructed with recurring costs well under $100,000. This system would provide the capabilities of a satellite bus, including power production and storage, processing, data storage, communications, and attitude determination and control.",

        "abstract": "The excitation of structural vibrations by turbulent boundary layer surface pressure fluctuations is an important problem in underwater acoustics.  A capability for accurately characterizing these fluctuations, especially the low wavenumber components of the spectrum, is needed to determine the effect of the pressure fluctuations on the excitation of structural vibrations. This capability may also lead to strategies for reducing the effect of the turbulent boundary layer on vibrations.  The objective of the Phase I program is to compute the two-dimensional surface pressure fluctuations for one or more prototype flow geometries which possess a dominant perturbation frequency.  The dominant perturbation would generate other spectral components in the boundary layer that will be studied in detail.  The geometries to be studied could produce low wavenumber spectra with greater magnitudes than typically found for flat plate boundary layers.  An advanced computational fluid dynamics approach based on a very large eddy simulation (VLES) of the Navier-Stokes equations will be used as the basis for a study of boundary layer surface pressure fluctuations. The advantage of the VLES technique is not only the reduced computational time for this case, but its capability for treating large, practical geometries with three dimensional fluctuations in Phase II.",

The proposed innovationis to use recently available light emitting diode (LED) light sources and fiberoptic components to realize an NOx monitor working on the gas-filter correlationprinciple.  The Phase I effort will consist of:  1) building a prototype in theproposed configuration, and measuring its sensitivity and response tointerferents; 2) determining by experiment and modelling an optimized design,specifically optimizing the filter design and the coupling of light from thesources into the fibers; and 3) testing the feasibility of real time computercontrol of ozone titration of NO to NO2.

This includes such breakthroughs as Acousto-Optic Tunable Filters and microbolometer detector arrays.  Coupled with the continuing growth in microprocessor power, this promises to make a new generation of fast, cheap and reliable infrared (IR) fire detectors possible that do not suffer from the false alarm problems that plague current designs.  Since they sense the radiation emitted by a pending fire, they will be faster than smoke detectors that rely on smoke reaching the sensor.  The proposed research is to see if the promise can be realized.  Analysis will concentrate on the 4.3 um CO2 emission feature characteristic of flames.  The 2.7 um H20 emission band will also be considered.  Using computer models like the Aerodyne Radiation Code (ARC) supplemented with lab measurements on actual flames, the IR signature of flames and false alarm sources will be examined and compared.  These will be used to drive a smart IR fire detection performance model that will explore the range of sensor designs for cost effective ones.",

Besides the need for a commercial silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology, significant reductions in process and device dimensions will be required. The combination of SOI material and small geometry devices will mean that wafer fab manufacturing variations will play a much larger role in determining circuit performance than in the past. For optimum performance, the designer must understand the relatiopnship between the process variations and the circuit performance. To address this problem, we propose to use the software technology called STADIUM which as been developed by Florida Institute of Technology under funding from SEMATECH. The thrust of this program is to perform research and development at AET, Inc., and Florida Institute of Technology aimed at transforming the STADIUM technology into a robust product for military and commerical dual use. The overall technical objective of the program is to establish the feasibility of statistical semicaonductor device simulation based on the methodology of design of experiments. In addition, we plan to investigate methodologies for developing statistical process and device models for SOI technologies which can be used to optimize processes and devices, and to estimate integrated circuit product yield. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: This research will allow the commercilization of previous ARPA funded SEMATECH work and focus it on the Low Power Electronics program.

        "abstract": "Reverse Osmosis, as an effective method for recovery of fresh water from seawater by desalination, is gaining considerable attention. The problems associated with reverse osmosis process are the concentration polarization and membraine fouling, which cause the decline of membrane flux and require the use of higher system pressure and regularly cleaning.  Frequent cleaning not only is a cost operation, but also leads to significant logistics and safety problem.  Tangential-flow filtration technique reduces the concentration polarization and fouling by controlling the feed flow pattern so as to enhance the transport of the retained solute particles away from the membrane surface and back to the bulk of the feed.  Because of the intrinsic steady uniform attributes, it can not completely eliminate the concentration polarization and fouling.  AETRI proposes a high rate, cleaning free, low energy costs, Pulsating-flow Reverse Osmosis (PRO) technology which suggests a complete new approach to the reverse osmosis process and is capable of effectively eliminating concentration polarization and membrane fouling.  PRO preserves the membrane flux at a desired original level with no need of increasing the system pressure, hence, it provides a potential of overall system size and weight reduction.",

        "abstract": "The proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell is being considered as power source for a variety of applications (1-4).  Gravimetric and volumetric energy density, life cycle costs, ease and safety of operation are major considerations which may favor a PEM fuel cell power source over batteries.  The proposed PEM fuel cell power source relies on an assembly of series connected cells arranged on board.  For this purpose, ionically conductive areas of the ionexchange membrane are separated by zones in which the sulfonic acid group has been neutralized to render it ionically non conductive.  The conductive areas of the ionexchange membrane are laminated with circular electrodes to form a multi cell MEA.  The electrodes are contacted by porous carbon structures with hydrophilic and hydrophobic zones. They are electrically isolated and facilitate reactant distribution and product water transport.  These circular multipurpose collectors are positioned by a locating board followed by another board with electrical feed throughs which facilitate external, series cell-to-cell connection while providing a manifold cover for reactant distribution.  A 4 cell PEM fuel cell board will be constructed.  In an optional phase of the proposed effort, it will be combined with a hydrogen generator relying on product water for reaction with alkali metal hydrides.",

        "abstract": "This proposal would establish a pilot-scale algal scrubber to treat secondary discharge from dairy-processing plants.  Algal scrubbers are fixed-media structures for culturing periphyton communities with two major components:  an autotrophic assemblage of microscopic, filamentous algae, and an association of heterotrophic bacteria and protozoans.  Under conditions favorable to photosynthesis, the algal component is able to clear mineral nutrients from effluents with great efficiency, whereas the heterotrophs can metabolize dissolved organic either simultaneously or in darkness.  Algal scrubbers thus hold unique potential for processing phosphorus and BOD, two pollutants highly concentrated in dairy-plant wastes.  Because the U.S. dairy industry is under pressure to meet increasingly stringent discharge standards, it is necessary to develop innovative, economical, and environmentally sustainable technologies for handling secondary effluent from on-site treatment facilities.  Research proposed here would contribute to this effort by testing algal-scrubber response to elevated concentrations of such sewage.  Scrubber performance in pollutant clearance would be measured by chemical analysis of water-samples.  Dry-weight biomass, chlorophyll a content, and algal species distributions would monitor composition and stability of the scrubber community.  Results are expected to indicate effluent dilutions and algal-scrubber areas required for reliable treatment of these discharges.",

Accordingly, we address the problem of the passive identification of radar emitters in emitter dense and electromagnetically cluttered environments. We propose to develop novel non-orthogonal wavelet representations to characterize specific emitters as an alternative to currently applied Fourier methods.

        "abstract": "Current lithography techniques generally adopted by the semiconductor industry in the U.S. and other nations involve the use of masks which are prepared either by photolithography or by electron beam lithography.  The masks consist of a glass plate on which a layer of chrome and another layer of resist are deposited. The resist is developed where it is irradiated and the chrome is etched thus leaving the pattern which is then imaged via steppers on the wafer.  The preparation of masks generates undesirable chemical wastes which have to be specially disposed of to protect the environment.  We propose to study the possibility of eliminating the chemical wastes by using a special glass whose opacity is directly affected by the electron beam.  The glass can be used to image the pattern on the wafer and no resist or chrome is used or removed.  Ideally, the glass can be restored to its original status when heated above a predetermined critical temperature.  Thus, recycling of the mask becomes feasible under those conditions.  Factors such as the resolving power of the glass, the amount of energy needed to change the opacity of the glass and the shelf life of the pattern written on the glass will be addressed.",

A fundamental challenge in spurring the wide acceptance of VCSELs lies in the development of a high yield crystal growth process. The study will focus on the following areas: the installation of complementary optical techniques such as pyrometric interferometry and optical reflection for improved in situ monitoring; the establishment of an accurate optical parameter extraction procedure that accounts for parameter variation between growth and operating temperatures; the construction and evaluations of a prototype feedback control system based on the growth of AlAs/GaAs quarter-wavelength Distributed Bragg Reflector (DBR) structures. Successful implementation of the project provides both experimental and theoretical framework for eventual development of a high yield manufacturing crystal growth process for VCSELs. Applications include fiber optic communication, digital printing and scanning, flat-panel display, and optical disk storage. Furthermore, VCSEL arrays can stimulate the widespread use of multi-channel optical components in the emerging information highways, next generation.",

It has been applied with excellent results (zero false and missed alarms, with 4% probability of deferral to the next decision time) to helicopter gearbox test-stand accelerometer data. The front-end of our environment extracts novel feature sets offered by the continuous wavelet transform (CWT), on which we train and evaluate a classical artificial neural network classifier. We propose to apply this approach to two forms of acoustic data collected in Phase 1: field data collected using an external acoustic sensor focused on the gearbox areas of an actual SH-60 helicopter, and synthetic data from an acoustic sensor in a controlled acoustic space containing loudspeakers driven by gearbox test-stand accelerometer signals plus recordings of helicopter rotor downwash and engine noise. We will compare the FDI results for the synthetic data with that previously obtained using the accelerometer signals directly, and determine dominant CWT features associated with the actual unfailed gearboxes. We will also develop the plan for Phase II, in which we will obtain and analyze sufficient data to demonstrate the reliability and robustness of the approach.",

The innovation of this approach is to first define the architecture and then design and implement the real-time control software.  In addition to a software environment for real-time control, this effort will create reusable algorithm components, device drivers, timer service and interface components conforming to the DSSA program.  The architecture will be defined, described and evaluated through the use of the formal architecture description language (ADL) Rapide which allows easy model building and prototyping of large-scale systems with constructs that facilitate the description of concurrency and timing.  Windows displays, mouse cursor selection, graphical modeling and on-line parameter tuning are incorporated elements that lead to a user-friendly interface.  A prototype demonstration at AGNC will implement a real-time interface with the functions of code generation, cross compilation and assembly, downloading, tracing and debugging.  The Phase II efforts will apply the DSSA approach to the battlefield management area of distributed expert system decision aids for the small unit commander.  A software architect will be defined to fuse sensor data, geographic data, meteorological data and intelligence data into a succinct and thoroughly informative inference structure so as to provide the commander complete situation awareness and support in decision making.",

CBD sensing systems function as early warning and detection devices for aircraft and military personnel. A CBD detection system based on an innovative combination of solid state mass-sensitive surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors, microbore capillary columns, and an innovative silicon collector/preconcentrator is proposed. The advantages of the proposed system are: High sensitivity (less than 0.01 mg/m3), small size, solid state construction, light weight, and its ability to operate unattended for long periods without operator intervention. In addition, the proposed micro machined silicon collector/preconcentrator will also interface with other vapor detection systems such as ion mobility spectrometers (IMS). The construction and evaluation of prototype collectors will be carried out during Phase I of the proposed project. Following successful demonstration of the all-silicon collector, a Phase II effort will design, construct, and test a fully fieldable hand held chemical collection and analysis system. The goal of the proposed research is to develop a hand held trace analysis system for monitoring chemical agents on the battlefield and hazardous chemicals in industrial environments. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: The end product will be a handheld CBD agent detection and monitoring system. Other important commercial applications include environmental monitoring for volatile organic compounds (VOCs), waste site remediation, and industrial workplace monitoring to comply with the Clean Air Act. The benefits include improved safety at industrial sites, particularly where there is a need for monitoring for the presence of dangerous pollutants.",

However, there remains a need to develop a reliable, highly sensitive and lightweight instrument capable of performing immunoassays of toxins or infectious disease agents in war zones, to monitor decontamination procedures or to detect traces of biological agents for treaty verification.  This proposal suggests the development of a compact, diode laser-based biosensor that can be used in war zones and in compliance monitoring.  The innovation of the proposed system is the combination of sensitive diode laser-based methods of excitation with near-infrared saturable absorber-tagged immunological or DNA hybridization probes to provide a sensor having unparalleled sensitivity to biological warfare agents and toxins.

        "abstract": "Developments in on-site spent solvent recovery have implications for reducedenvironmental pollution in the dry cleaning, furniture and paint manufacturingindustries as well as in a range of commercial services.  Effluents from solventrecovery operations include fugitive emissions, vent stack gases and water/solvent mixtures.  At present, the scale of solvent-recovery operations incertain industries is too small to allow cost-effective application of gas orliquid chromatographic instrumental methods, yet the total volume of pollutantsdischarged from these operations is environmentally significant.  To remedy thissituation, this proposal suggests the development of low-cost continuous solventmonitors based on near-infrared fluorescence.  The innovation contained in theproposal is the combination of sensitive diode laser excited fluorescence methodswith integrated methods of instrument design to achieve the Phase I TechnicalObjectives, which include the evaluation of near-infrared fluorophores forsolvent analysis, the design of an integrated laser excited fluorescenceanalyzer, and acquisition of families of test data to provide information for usein instrument optimization and extensive field-testing in Phase II of theprogram.  The significance of the program is the reduction of solvent dischargeand improvement is separation operations afforded by low-cost in situ chemicalanalysis.",

        "abstract": "The overall quality and the comprehensive strength, in particular, of concrete are critically dependent on the water content in the concrete mixture.  It is also essential to know if the concrete has reached a stage of moisture equilibrium before surface finishes such as paint or carpet can be applied.  At present, no reliable method or easy-to-use instrument exists for determining the moisture content of concrete once it is cast.  To address this need, this proposal suggests the development of a resonance sensor system for in situ measurement of moisture content in concrete.  The proposal is innovative in the use of an electromagnetic resonance sensor for accurately monitoring the changes in the dielectric constant due to change of moisture content in concrete.  Phase I Technical Objectives include evaluation of frequency ranges at which the dielectric constant of concrete is most sensitive to moisture content, design and fabrication of resonance sensors, acquisition of families of test data on standardized concrete slabs, and optimization of an engineering model to be fabricated and extensively tested in the Phase II program.  It is anticipated that the Phase I program will demonstrate the feasibility of this measurement technique, and the Phase II program will result in a demonstration system that can be used on construction sites for moisture measurement in concrete structures.",

Although the use of subtherapeutic concentrations of anti-microbial agents in animal feed has contributed to the productivity of the U.S. meat and dairy industries by preventing infectious diseases, by decreasing the amount of feed required and by increasing the rate of animal weight gain, failure to observe recommended practices of drug withdrawl can result in concentrations of antibiotic residues in meat and dairy products that may lead to adverse physical effects including human allergenic reactions and increased cancer rates.  To improve this situation, this proposal suggests the development of a field-usable Raman spectrograph for use in product assurance, quality control and product inspection.  The proposal is innovative by combining visible and near-infrared signal excitation with SERS techniques to achieve the Phase I Technical Objectives, which include fabrication of surface-enhanced Raman scattering probes, selection of laser source and detection components and assembly of the Phase I optical instrument, and calibration of the Phase I instrument under laboratory conditions.

With all of these antennas covering the chamber wall, the anechoic performance of the wall will be impaired by the RCS of the antennas themselves.  Current illumination requirements dictate large bandwidths (.5-18GHz) and control of polarization, gain and beamwidth antenna parameters.  Currently, the ridged horn, sinuous and spiral antennas are the most common commercially available antennas. However, these antennas are not able to adequately meet the desired RCS values needed for broadband anechoic chambers.  The goal of this proposal is to design and demonstrate a low RCS antenna configuration capable of operating from .5 to 18 GHz with controllable polarization and gain/beamwidth properties. Analytic Designs, Incorporated (ADI) has an innovative antenna capable of meeting or exceeding these design parameters, and has a wide collection of supporting test date to demonstrate performance specifications.  in fact, a great deal of interest in this antenna has been generated across various branches of the DoD, as well as among commercial venturers.",

The performance will be measured for SAR alone, FLIR alone, and for the combined SAR/FLIR using decision fusion techniques.  An analysis of these results will provide the basis for future research and development into multispectral fusion techniques.  These models and algorithms will be integrated into the Khoros/Cantata environment.  Additionally, research will be conducted to identify target-based features appropriate for feature level fusion.  This research will provide a basis for future feature level fusion techniques to be developed and tested.  A top-level design for a multispectral fusion simulation system in which to conduct information fusion and automatic target recognition (ATR) algorithm research and development will be produced. system",

The primary objective of this Phase I effort is to produce a prototype design of an Automated Model Interconnect Tool (AMIT) for identifying, extracting, transforming and integrating data between dissimilar legacy models. An AMIT can be used to support concept exploration and analysis of aeronautical weapon systems.  Drawing upon lessons learned from current model integration efforts, the focus of this research proposal is on prototyping a generic technique for data transformation and demonstrating the feasibility of an AMIT. Innovative technologies centered around object request broker architectures; synchronized data timing and control; high-speed, high-bandwidth, communication networks; and massively parallel hardware architectures will be used to produce a design solution to this model integration problem.",

        "abstract": "An attention mechanism can influence system behavior and performance only to the extent in which system resources are allocatable.  A key visual resource is acuity, which is fixed in conventional uniform acuity machine vision.  Foveal vision features imagers with graded acuity coupled with context sensitive sensor gaze control, analogous to that prevalent throughout vertebrate vision.  Foveal systems operate more efficiently than uniform acuity systems because resolution is treated as a dynamically allocatable resource.  Wide FOV and localized high acuity are simultaneously supported while minimizing sensor data to that which is relevant.  Foveal system development is hampered by the need for attention mechanisms and gaze control which are more refined than that of uniform acuity vision, and must rapidly allocate spatiotemporal resolution in dynamic non-deterministic environments.  This program will apply reinforcement learning to foveal attention and gaze control to improve the performance of autonomous platform vision.  Reinforcement learning will be used to optimize sequences of salient point interrogations in scale space e.g., saccades), and improve the information acquisition ability of a  foveal agent.  Visual attention will be posed as a optimization problem which attempts to accelerate foveal object recognition and reduce multiresolution object model complexity.  Reinforcement learning will also be used to control the switching of vision task modalities, and preattentive preemption.  The learning of attention invariants among different targets and poses will also be investigated.",

Even though clock speed and processing power of general purpose workstations are improving constantly, increases in size and complexity of VLSI chips indicates that this problem will only get worse. In the past, this problem has been addressed using special purpose hardware; example systems include the IBM Yorktown Simulation enginer, the Zycad XP simulation booster and FPGA based circuit emulators. These approaches require special purpose hardware and are expensive; they are also not inherently scalable. Perhaps the most promising approach is the use of general purpose, scalable, massively-parallel technology developed under the HPCC initiative for parallel execution of circuit simulation programs.  Depending on circuit parameters, it is possible to get significant speedups from relatively inexpensive parallel architectures (e.g. multi-systems like the Thinking Machine CM5 and the Intel Paragon. The result of Phase I will be a detailed report outlining the technical methodology to be used to develop a next-generation parallel circuit simulator for general purpose parallel processing computers as well as detailing a productization strategy that will guarantee easy adoption within the EDA industry.

        "abstract": "This project is designed to investigate an innovative remotely delivered needle-less controlled release implant to provide antimicrobial (ceftiofur) therapy to calves with bovine respiratory disease complex.  Bovine respiratory disease complex is the most economically important (an economic impact of $624 million in 1992) infectious disease of calves in North American feedlots.  Although antimicrobials are available they are only available in the traditional needle and syringe format.  Administration via the needle and syringe format requires extensive effort and significant time and animals with marginal symptoms may not be treated promptly.  Further, administration imposes stress on an animal already in a precarious condition.  Data already collected demonstrate that the needle-less delivery system does not evoke stress (as measured by cortisol response to administration) on animals.  Additional data demonstrate that one needle-less controlled release ceftiofur implant may be efficacious for three days.  The objectives are to determine efficacy of the needle-less controlled release ceftiofur implant in calves with bovine respiratory disease complex and relate response to blood ceftiofur concentrations.  Both studies will include four groups:  1-ceftiofur injected for three days, ceftiofur needle-less implants (2-three daily administrations, 3-two administrations [day 1 and 3], and 4-one administration).",

These compliant substrates will then be used to deposit thin layers of GaN followed by subsequent annealing to relax the structure. Thicker layers of GaN deposited on these structures will have a significantly reduced number of defects. We will at each step analyze the improvements in the defect reduction via X-ray and electron microscopy techniques. We will collaborate with Professor Subash Mahajan's group at CMU.

A true straddle tractor for tall crops on hillsides does not currently exist.  This straddle tractor, the Smart Mountain Mule (SMM), will be designed as a tool for Christmas tree farms in hilly terrain.  The ultimate goal of the researchers (through Phase II and beyond) is to design and build a safe tractor with four-wheel drive, four-wheel steering, and a smart tilting system, that is able to tilt its center of gravity to negotiate hillsides and straddle crops such as Christmas trees.  The Phase I goal is to prepare preliminary designs for certain key subsystems, i.e. the steering and tilting systems, to build a scale model prototype of the tractor, and to perform a thorough safety analysis.  The PI and researchers at TRDC will work with consultants to create a computer simulation of the tilting and steering systems of the mountain tractor.  The principal investigator, a professional tree farmer and expert in the requirements of a tree-farming tractor, will create the scale model prototypes using the computer simulation as a guide.  Since studies have shown that more than 70% of tractor roll-over injuries and deaths occur on slopes, safety analysis will be crucial in every step of the design.",

        "abstract": "Under the current U.S. Navy budget constrained environment it is desirable to get added functional performance from existing sonar systems.  One such case is the need to provide instantaneous bearing ambiguity resolution for threat torpedoes at tactically significant ranges via U.S. Navy Surface Ship towed arrays.  A multi-line towed array sonar system is recommended as a Bearing Ambiguity Resolution Sensor (BARS).  The proposed system employs existing towed array technology and system components to provide a towed array sonar system with capabilities including: left/right discrimination at the beam level to instantly localize detected targets, high array gain to operate in the littoral ambient noise conditions, operation in the same frequency band as hull mounted sonar systems for passive localization, and utilization of an existing towed array handling system. The array system design will rely heavily on NDI and COTS components resulting in a low risk development program.  Phase II will then develop an Advance Development Module (ADM) system with the lowest possible cost for full scale, at-sea performance demonstration and verification.",

        "abstract": "When waveguides of high power radar systems are installed in corrosive environments gaps tend to form at the joints.  These gaps change the characteristic impedance of the waveguide, causing reduced system efficiency and potential damage to the radar.  An indication of these gaps are arcs generated by the high power radar signals crossing the gaps.  Phase I will develop and validate a technique to locate the gaps in the radar waveguides early on so that the joints may be repaired, reducing potential damage to the radar.  The technique used will detect and localize the source of the acoustic energy produced by the arcs.  A study of the airborne and structural acoustic transmission paths will be conducted to determine which acoustical sensor is more appropriate, microphones or accelerometers.  The system will then use the selected sensors to monitor the waveguide.  The data from these sensors will then be analyzed using various detection methods, and the optimum method selected and refined.  A prototype system will be constructed and tested to prove the concept.  AMSI has developed both hardware and software for numerous acoustical data acquisition and detection systems.  The proposed personnel for this SBIR have over 50  years combined experience in these fields.",

Mining metal forming, and echo ranging are examples. This proposal is for the design of a pulsed power sonobuoy suitable for use in a three-element array, to provide, the acoustic output effectively equivalent to that from a 4-pound sound underwater source (SUS) charge. A preliminary design is presented which takes into account the major sub-systems for an A-sized sonobuoy. The acoustic source is an underwater spark discharge which propagates along the surface of a ceramic insulator. The spark is driven by a low inductance pulsar consisting of a capacitor and a gas-pressurized spark-gap. While the capacitor is being charged the spark-gap insulates the capacitor from the ceramic insulator. A rapid movement of a relay contact triggers the spark-gap and initiates the surface discharge along the ceramic insulator. A compact switching-type power supply charges the capacitor in less than 10 s. A 48 V battery storing 1000 Watt-hours (3.5 MJ) provides power to the sonobuoy. A compact control unit equipped with a fiber-optic input permits communication between the submerged sonobuoys and a surface control unit.",

        "abstract": "A new automated methodology for collecting, analyzing, and reporting fragment data from warhead arena tests is proposed. While the Air Force has digitally recorded average fragment velocity data using electronic velocity screens since 1971, fragment mass distributions are still determined using a time consuming and labor intensive process of manually locating, cleaning, and weighing fragments. In addition, there is no integrated, on-site software capability for reducing test data and quickly generating test reports. The proposed approach combines a new Automated Fragment Recovery System (AFRS) and a new Quick Look Reporting Environment (QLRE) with the existing Air Force Vulnerability And Lethality Test System (VALTS) to produce a complete, automated arena testing capability. AFRS will record fragment impact locations using proximity sensors and will record fragment masses using an electronic weighing system. The QLRE is an integrated suite of Windows-based software tools for managing, analyzing, and rapidly reporting the large quantities of data typically produced in arena tests.  The Phase I effort will produce a 1/4-scale prototype of the AFRS data collection system and prototype components of the QLRE. The goal is to determine the feasibility of developing and testing a full scale VALTS/AFRS/QLRE system in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Under the proposed research a single degree-of-freedom hinge will be developed that exaggerates actuation by either a piezoceramic or a shape-memory alloy.  The proposed hinge is a marriage of two concepts, one providing exaggerated excitation and the other providing bearing-free rotational mobility.  The first concept translates the relatively small motion achievable with smart materials (shape-memory alloys or piezoceramics) into a large rotation using appropriate rolling contact surfaces.  The second concept comprises a hinge equipped with conical inserts that when activated allow free rotational movement about the hinge's axis but otherwise pre-load the hinge.  The rotational mobility of this hinge does therefore not compromise the load carrying capability of the hinge, nor its predictability and reliability.  The features of the aforementioned concepts are combined to create a low cost versatile hinge that provides actuation, is highly reliable and predictable.",

        "abstract": "ARA along with its team member Ryan International Airlines proposes to develop an innovative stochastic decision tool for selecting among the various life extensions options for aging aircraft.  The methodology is based on a genetic algorithm search that can efficiently choose among various alternatives.  The search algorithm retrieves input from a relational database designed to store and manage the aircraft operational, inspection, maintenance and rehabilitation history.  The database is also designed to maintain the system logic describing the relationship between component failures, system performance, and current status data.  Thus, life extension options can be evaluated mechanistically and their impact on system performance can be quantified via a Markovian transition probability model.  Ryan International will provide the necessary experience and data to guide development of the system, based on their experiences with their fleet of 46 jet cargo aircraft.  In Phase I, operation of the system will be demonstrated via application to an actual aircraft.  Also a prototype graphical user interface will be developed for the software to allow intuitive operation of the system.",

In this proposed effort, thermoplastics reinforced with VGCF will be used to form structural panels and I-beams for tactical communication equipment enclosures.

However, their performance degrades beyond 24 hours due to lack of accurate long range forecast of the critical weather parameters used as inputs.  Pilots and planners require precise forecasts of acquisition and lock-on ranges.  A neural network model will be demonstrated which operates like the human forecaster with noisy and missing data but able to integrate much more of the existing data and to consider explicitly the nonlinearities of the atmosphere.

        "abstract": "The standard technique for the recording of telemetry data in range operations has been instrumentation tape recording.  This has provided the capability for recording data at high data rates for extended periods of time.  While convenient for recording, this technique suffers drawbacks in processing and playback of the data. Due to the serial nature of the medium, no capability exists for near-realtime playback of data.  An alternative to tape recording is a random access medium, such as disk drives.  Advances have occurred within the computer industry in the last few years in disk drive technology--increased media transfer rates within disk drives and decreased prices.  A new method of combining independing drives to operate functionally as a single large disk drive, referred to as RAID, an acronym for Redundant Array of Independent Disks, is commercially availabe.  Local busarchitectures within PC platforms make them capable of sustaining high data transfer rates.  This work uses these advances to develop a low cost data acquisition system capable of high data transfer rates, simultaneous read and write capabilities, and storage of large amounts of data for near real-time recovery.",

        "abstract": "The increased emphasis on mass screening for early detection of cancer has created a demand for effective quality assurance of medical radiography equipment.  This is particularly true in mammography where indications of cancer are subtle and the image quality varies strongly with the x-ray technique used for the examination.  Many studies clearly indicate that well calibrated and aligned equipment is a key to producing the high quality images required for effective screening.  The measurement of x-ray tube voltage calibration is an important part of quality assurance for medical diagnostic examinations such as mammography.  A new method, recently developed by NIST, gives a direct measurement of the tube voltage from the x-ray spectrum of the tube.  An instrument is required to measure the spectrometric image and transfer the data to a portable computer which can then compute the high energy limit and hence the tube voltage.  We propose a new densitometer approach for this application.  The new approach proposed allows the use of inexpensive, commonly available components while producing the required wide dynamic range and high spatial resolution.  If the research is successful, it will be the basis for a low cost, high performance scanner.",

The service providers' goal is to provide sufficient bandwidth to support both existing services and novel applications such as on-demand video.  For economic reasons, service providers will retain as much of their existing network infrastructure as possible.  As such, a single pipe carrying digital voice, video, and data into the home and office is expected; an access device will be required to interface existing user-equipment to the incoming data stream.    We propose an easily reconfigurable, low cost broadband-ISDN access device that uses credit-card-size replaceable modules to provide access to different physical connections and physical-layer protocols.  The physical-layer adapter will forward digital data to a variety of interface adapters that provide functions, such as video transmission to televisions, voice transmission to telephones, and data routing to local area networks and personal computers.

        "abstract": "There is a need for accurate and cost effective airborne techniques to estimate fish biomass in the open ocean.  Arete proposes to develop in Phase I optimal detection algorithms using existing imaging LIDAR data collected with the Fisheye(R) sensor.  These algorithms will be developed to allow real-time detection of fish and fish schools, discrimination between fish and ambient clutter, and discrimination between various fish species.  This effort includes review and selection of VHS data, digitization of the data, development of reliable and efficient algorithms using statistical hypothesis testing, and scaling the algorithms to commercially available processors suitable for real-time operation.  In Phase II, Arete would build and test the real-time processing system for use with the Fisheye(R) sensor.  Phase III would lead to commercial applications in the fishing industry and in other industries that require real-time detection and recognition.  The proposed recognition system, when coupled to an imaging system such as Fisheye(R), will detect and identify schools of fish from the surface down to 120 ft.  Since Fisheye(R) is an active, gated sensor, depth-localization and day/night operation are possible.  The operator will be alerted visually and audibly when a school of fish or individual fish has been found, allowing for the review of detection data via user-selectable display options, which will mitigate against clutter and false alarms.  The proposed system can be used on existing  airborne platforms (helicopter or small fixed-wing aircraft) and is adaptable to any imaging system that provides digital or analog data.  Thus, the system will feature broad marketability and will be readily realized for use in commercial fishing fleets and scientific endeavors.",

        "abstract": "The use of metal/semiconductor (M/SC) interfaces, in the form of SC coatings on metal, is a new anti-corrosion technology based on creating an electronic barrier, through an intrinsic electric field, to the transfer of electrons from a metal substrate to oxidizing species such as oxygen in the environment.  The present work seeks to implement this technology with new, soluble, semiconducting organic Conducting Polymers (CPs).  The CPs chosen have in prior work shown high solubility and processability and very good environmental, thermal and oxidation stability (to 300 C in air over long periods).  On top of the anti-corrosion CP coating, a final epoxy topcoat, which can then be painted on, is used for additional abrasion resistance.  In the proposed work, these CP coatings will be studied and corrosion protection monitored via physical, electrochemical methods.  Coatings will be optimized and an integrated systems approach for aircraft application formulated.",

        "abstract": "Although significant work has been accomplished with thermally stable fuels and additive packages for use in high-temperature applications, research must be conducted to understand how these additives affect the low-temperature performance characteristics of jet fuel, including the formation and composition of liquid phase precipitates (LPPS) and gelatinous precipitates (GPs).  Until the chemical interactions, performance properties, and low temperature characteristics of the additive packages in jet fuel such as JP-8 and JP-8-100 are fully quantified and analyzed, the use of these fuels in low-temperature flight operations may place air crews and aircraft in unnecessary risk.  Aspen Systems proposes to conduct an extensive fuel chemistry study of these thermally stable fuels including JP-8, JP-8-100 and additive packages, by evaluating them in a qualification matrix of low temperature performance tests. Additionally, we will design and synthesize \"Novel Inclusion Molecules\" which are hydrophobic molecules with integral hydrophobic interior regions.  These unique compounds will effectively encapsulate dissolved matter and thus prevent the phase separation of water.  To accomplish this research, we have assembled a world-class team of chemistry experts, aviation fuel experts, and university researchers, including the staff and facilities of WL/POSF.",

It calls for the molecular self-assembly of protein masks on a surface which has been primed with SAMs (self-assembled monolayers) which themselves have been modified, in a parallel process, by deep UV radiation. After the protein masks have been self-assembled, the process of \"parallel nanometer molecular lithography\" provides an entirely parallel methodology for the transfer of the nanometer-scale pattern of the mask to the substrate surface.  The subsequent application of LE4 (low energy electron enhanced etching) to impress a deeper nanostructuring into the substrate material is a parallel process as well.  The successful demonstration of electroluminescence from quantum dot arrays of crystalline silicon nanofabricated by the proposed techniques would provide the first advanced-concept material derived from this highly innovative approach.",

This method uses intersecting lasers in a gaseous medium to cause fluorescence from desired points. By scanning a series of intersection points in either a rastor or vector scan in a timeless than the eye's 15 Hz refresh rate, a true three-dimensional image can be generated. The idea has recently become much more practical with the advent of visible diode lasers. The concept will be demonstrated using rubidium vapor and diode lasers at 780 nm (writing an invisible excited line or plane) and 630 nm (causing red fluorescence at the intersection point with the 780 nm laser). The method can be extended to other colors such as yellow, green, and blue as appropriate diode laser sources become available. Mechanical scanners will be used for the Phase I demonstration. A scaled up device would be likely to use acousto-optic scanners to achieve large numbers of voxels (3-D pixels). In addition to being able to write fluorescent images into the display, there is the potential for writing absorbing opaque regions, through which hidden objects cannot be seen. Anticipated benefits include better displays of three-dimensional medical information, battlefield and missile information, and air traffic control data. Commercial applications include movie special effects, advertising displays, and eventually three-dimensional television for the home.",

Advances in registration technology (e.g., GPS) will accurately locate the robot in space. Multi-sensors along with image understanding and processing systems will recognize and enhance nearby objects. The key to this capability is wireless command and control. Unfortunately, the demands placed on a wireless communication system by the TRS mission requirements establish a capability envelope far in excess of those currently employed in commercial systems (e.g., cellular). We propose R2D2 as an innovative technology capable of overcoming the current limitation associated with mobile wireless communications. We shall demonstrate that the R2D2 is (1) robust and resistant to jamming, (2) supports video with possible non-distorting compression, (3) has multiple access capabilities, (4) has extended range capabilities, and (5) has extremely low power and small packaging requirements. Our response to this challenge is based on the Athena ACT technology which has been shown to be a powerful single-chip direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) technology supporting the required TRS functions. The proposed study combines both theoretical and experimental components which will support the R2D2 claims and establish performance predictions for a Phase II demonstration system. In addition, critical VLSI elements of the R2D2 will be fabricated and tested in support of the overall project.",

        "abstract": "This Phase I SBIR proposal is aimed at developing and assessing the feasibility of Image Processing Techniques to distinguish between submarine and non-submarine in Active Sonar Echoes. Image Processing Techniques have proven to be highly effective in detecting objects in cluttered backgrounds using other sensors such as Synthetic Aperture Radar, Infrared Sensors, and Lasers. The highly reverberant environment associated with Active Sonar in Shallow Water represents a challenging problem of finding a target in dense clutter. The features of the Sonar Echoes will be analyzed using the Image and Signal Processing computer system at Atlantic Aerospace. The proposed technique offers potential for major performance improvement relative to existing methods. In addition this approach offers the potential of implementing these techniques in affordable commercially available hardware. Atlantic Aerospace Electronics Corporation has teamed (as the Prime contractor) with Westinghouse Electric Corporation (as the sub-contractor) to develop an optimum transition of this technology into Surface Ship ASW systems. This team provides the US Navy with the best capability in both fields; Atlantic Aerospace is on the forefront of Image Processing and Westinghouse is the premier supplier of Surface Ship ASW systems to the US Navy. In Phase II we will implement the Image Processing algorithms into a real time system using the VME architecture.",

        "abstract": "This proposal presents a unique and innovative approach to designing and realizing an integrated aperture made up of a wideband, nominally 0. 5 to 2. 0 GHz, array and a precision X-band array. AAEC proposes to realize the wideband element by a rigid wire structure. Second, AAEC proposes a design tool based on well validated computational electromagnetics codes that actually relate changes in the near field behavior of the X-band antenna to the wideband antenna structure that is responsible for these changes. This allows the designer to rapidly progress through a convergent design process without the time consuming and costly process of empirical iterations. Finally, the principle approach proposed to realize the wideband array elements is through the application of frequency-selective-surface techniques. AAEC proposes the use of discrete chip components which present appropriate open circuits in the wideband element structure at X-band, but which are low loss, short circuits at the UHF/L-band operational frequencies.",

Traditional methods, based on classical adaptive communication theory, have limited ability when presented with complex signals and images.  Wavelets have recently been proposed as a potentially useful de-noising technology. Athena proposes QUIESCENT, a comprehensive wavelet-based de-noising study leading to a technology definition.  Our approach is based on Athena's considerable experience in applying wavelets to medical images and wavelet processor designs.  A highly qualified and experienced study team for QUIESCENT will employ advanced wavelet techniques and introduce new methodologies in multiscale representation on interval, interpolation, packets, local and best bases, to produce a powerful experimental and algorithm development workstation-based environment we call WES( Wavelet Experimental System).  Within this environment, Athena will develop new soft and nonlinear thresholding, edge, and packet de-noising techniques, and experimentally study them over a large class of signals and images. Finally Athena will provide a definitive hardware implementation study which will lead to the definition of a real-time QUIESCENT processor.",

The capability of the current SGTC is limited by the speed of the ODs that use long access time to realize the specified time-bandwidth (TB) product. The objective of this program is to develop a high-speed IR two-axis AOD achieving an access time of 5 microseconds while maintaining the TB product of 256 X 256 spots. Novel AOD designs based on birefringent diffraction and phased array transducers will be developed to achieve the design goals.

One of the most competitive solutions to these stresses is wavelet-based data compression.  A wide variety of wavelet image compression methods exists, and given an application, there is a need to compare different methods before defining the software solution.\n\nWe propose to develop a Wavelet Image Compression Workbench to accelerate the prototyping, evaluation, and use of this new technology.  This Workbench will integrate Aware's state-of-the-art wavelet image compression software into Adobe Photoshop, combining our expertise in wavelet methods with the analysis tools of a proven commercial-off-the-shelf image processing package.  Our vision for Phase II involves the development of an automatic code generator that will produce Photoshop-independent software; thus a wavelet algorithm may be turned to a specific application with the Workbench and Photoshop, and then deployed as a standalone executable on a variety of platforms or inserted as a linkable library into larger products.  This represents an innovation both in ease of prototyping and evaluation, and in ease of deployment for wavelet image compression.",

The application of such technology will improve the mobility and deployability of the tactical equipment as performance requirements become more demanding.  High speed alternators can be decreased in size proportionally to their operating speed.  Power Frequency Converters provide high quality output while offering other possible features such as starter/generator systems and uninterruptible power.  Additional generator set system weight reduction is possible by exploiting the flexibility of solid state power conversion approaches.  The feasibility will be determined by systematically achieving the project objectives including determine: The optimum HFA-PFC architecure, The optimum HFA design, The optimum PFC topology, and Identifying the power semiconductor technology.  The HFA-PFC interaction with the engine will also be reviewed for potential improvements in efficiency and further size reduction through employing a variable speed approach taking advantage of the engine's dynamic performance range.

        "abstract": "The shallow-water and surf-zone mine clearance mission is being  addressed by existing U. S. Navy programs.  The clearance of manmade  obstacles from the surf-zone and beach comprises an equal priority for  the amphibious assault mission in littoral warfare.  The effectiveness  of non-explosive obstacles to deter a U. S. amphibious assualt mission  has been increased somewhat by the introduction of the Navy's LCAC into  the force structure.  Marine Corps Engineers routinely utilize tractor  crawlers, tracked loaders and rough terrain crane/shovels over land to  effect the clearance of trees, rocks, and manmade structures and to  fill pits and trenches.  However, the surf-zone obstacle clearance  mission requires operations on the beach, in plunging surf, loose sand,  soft sediments, and in shallow water up to a depth of at least 10 ft.   What is required is a fully-amphibious bulldozer/loader/crane which can  operate effectively over all types of marginal terrains and sediments.   The technical key to developing this surf-zone vehicle is to develop an  amphibious propulsor which will meet the demanding performance  requirements proposed.  The propulsor should be highly reliable and  rugged with exceptional invulnerability to damage from non-explosive  and explosive obstacles.  The candidate propulsor proposed, herein, is  the screw-rotor and the proposed vehicle is designated the Razing  Amphibian, Screw Propelled (RASP).  The screw-rotor is sometimes  referred to as an Archimedes Screw and is a single device comprising a  helical rib arranged on a rotating cylinder.  The screw-rotor has a  proven capability to provide continuous, efficient propulsive thrust in  water and over land, silt, mud, clay, coral, rubble and weed.  The  rotor design can be tailored exactly to the vehicle power/speed/thrust  requirements.  The entire propulsion system is extremely simple and  rugged and the rotor can be armored against shrapnel and shock.",

        "abstract": "State-of-the-art real-time diagnostic systems generally consist of two integrated components: fault detection and fault classification (isolation) systems. Although such systems may be able to recognize failure precursors, they have no mechanism for exploiting diagnostic information for prognostic purposes, i.e., for predicting the time to machinery failure. Prognostic information is critical as it provides a quantitative measure on which to base subsequent actions. It is the essential improvement needed in future condition-based maintenance systems and the one for which demand is greatest in both the military and commercial communities. The approach taken herein is based on the development of analytic parametric machinery component models. Analytic models are reconciled with sensor-based information by using adaptation to \"parameterize\" faults; such models thereby characterize the dynamic state of the machinery components modeled. The process of going from vibration signatures to analytic model parameterization is inherently an inverse problem, and one that neural networks are well suited to solve in real time. Once the analytic model parameters are identified, they may be used to initialize critical failure mechanics (e.g., crack growth) models, which can be used to predict remaining useful life under any user- specified loading condition.",

        "abstract": "Due to recent advances in high-performance rare earth magnet materials,  permanent magnet (PM) machines are one of the fastest growing  electrical machine markets.  PM machines provide the excitation field  without the significant excitation losses of field-excited machines,  nearly eliminate rotor cooling requirements, simplify stator cooling,  and reduce the size and weight of electric machines (i.e., generators  and motors).  Although short circuits in well-designed drive motors are  extremely rare, they have the potential to damage the machine due to  I2R heating and arcing.  This makes reliable and robust short circuit  fault detection and management crucial.  The work outlined herein  proposes to develop algorithms for insulation integrity monitoring and  incipient (i.e., developing) fault diagnoses based on an understanding  of PM machine fault mechanisms and identification of relevant machine  parameters.  Trend analysis, statistics, and pattern recognition  techniques, implemented via polynomial neural networks, will be used to  detect and classify incipient faults.  The work will lead to an  all-digital inverter controller/insulation integrity monitoring system  that is consistent with the Navy Integrated Power System (IPS) vision  of commonality and reduced cost.  Such a software programmable  controller could be hardware standardized for all of the  inverter-related functions aboard ships.",

International will test and improve a liquid catalyst for lead-acid batteries that extends battery life 2-4 times, eliminates hydrogen gassing, improves capacity by at least 25% and increases power capability.  B.A.T. will work with Electric Power Systems Lab and Optima Battery Co. to undergo a carefully controlled set of tests that evaluate the performance of three different concentrations of catalysts in Optima batteries.  Test procedures will replicate the process used by the U.S.A.B.C. for electric vehicle battery research.  Performance testing will include constant current, peak power, constant power, variable power and special power tests.  B.A.T. will improve the battery catalyst through careful observations of battery performance under testing and further chemical analysis and testing.  Further research will lead to the development of catalysts for all types of lead-acid batteries and for all uninterruptable power supply (UPS) applications.  Widespread use of the catalyst will lead to tremendous cost savings to the government and private sector in applications such as electric vehicles, car & truck batteries, communications equipment, power stations, and renewable energy systems.",

The module will be compatible with requirement to run ASTROS on a workstation by performing the actual CFD-like computations prior to the workstation optimization analysis.  The results of the CFD-like computations will be stored in an efficient manner so as to be rapidly inputted to ASTROS at runtime.

We derive the sensitivity equation as a Partial Differential Equation directly from the Navier-Stokes (with turbulence models) and solve it.  This reduces the computational requirements.

In contrast to other miniature pumps, it is simple to construct and will have no moving parts. The goals of Phase I are to design and build prototype pumps, and to characterize their performance. We will measure flow rates as a function of pump geometry and drive parameters. We will use this pump to make a miniature chemical-vapor preconcentrator.  We will evaluate its performance using a micromachined flexural-plate-wave chemical sensor to measure the concentration of volatile-organic-compounds desorbed from a sorptive matrix within the device. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: This pump technology should be broadly applicable in instrumentation for: monitoring compliance with chemical-warfare treaties, monitoring fuel leaks, classifying waste products in known storage facilities, feedback-control of waste-remediation processes, workplace chemical-exposure monitoring, and indoor-air quality monitoring.",

As a basic research, this proposal attempts to improve this catalyst so that our proposed catalysts/additives can extend battery life up to ten times and increase the battery's total capacity by one half.  Our confidence comes from the evaluation of chemistries of our proposed catalysts/additives, which are not only a combination of catalyst and additive, but also are multifunctional for both catalysts and additive.  The essential chemistry of the catalysts is by suppression of the side reactions of main electrochemical reactions of the batteries to increase charge and discharge efficiencies and capacities, and the essential chemistry of the additive is the elevation of material utilization.  In this research, a tentative accelerated life test is also developed, which constitutes another integral part of our contribution.  Our initial attempts have been proved very successful.  When this new and novel catalysts/additives developed here are added to the electrolyte, it will elevate the performance of lead-acid battery to a new higher level.  Furthermore, our technology can be also expanded to other conventional and new batteries.",

        "abstract": "Immunization has proven to be an effective method of protecting both military and cibilian populations from disease caused by bacterial, viral, or toxic agents.  The U.S. military faces the problem of protecting its personnel from incapacitation caused by exposure to agents of both natural and man-made orgin.  In developing countries, immunization is the most cost-effective weapon for disease prevention.  Unfortunately, since many vaccination protocols require multiple injections over an extended period of time, many of the potential benefits of widespread vaccination programs are not being realized due to logistical problems, expense, and high drop-out rates.  One approach to alleviating these problems  is the development of bioerodible polymeric vaccine-containing microcapsules capable of prolonged delivery of antigen and the ability to confer complete immunity for an extended period of time.  We propose to develop a microencapsulation system in which vaccines and other proteins can be encapsulated out of aqueous solution, producing biocompatible bioerodible capsules capable of prolonged antigen release.  We will evaluate the efficacy of this vaccine encapsulation and delivery system using a vaccine against a naturally occurring toxic agent of great interest to both military and civilian health agencies.",

Castration also produces a decrease in growth performance and a higher rate of carcass fat deposition.

This research plan evaluates the potential of enzyme castration to produce similar results in different age boars up to twelve weeks to improve growth performance and carcass characteristics.  A graduated dose of enzyme (mg per gram of testis) will be administered to boars in each test group based upon estimated testes weight.

        "abstract": "The U.S. Army has identified a need to accurately engage ground targets with low-cost munitions delivered from self-propelled artillery and towed guns.  Currently, munitions delivered from these platforms are not equipped with navigation sensors, and thus have no way to measure position, velocity, or attitude during flight.  Without this information, munition accuracy is entirely reliant on launch and environmental conditions such as gun orientation and wind stability.  In order to realize a significant improvement in munition accuracy, it is anticipated that innovative navigation sensors (gyros and accelerometers) will be required. Candidate sensors must be capable of surviving the high-g environment associated with gun-launched munitions and must be cost-effective relative to the throwaway cost of currently-fielded artillery systems.  The focus of this proposed research is to: (1) identify candidate navigation sensors for gun-launched \"smart\" munitions, (2) postulate innovative navigation systems (e.g., shock-hardened IMUs and GPS receivers), and (3) conduct tradeoff analyses to characterize the feasibility of each candidate system.  Detailed mathematical models will be formulated to characterize candidate navigation system behavior, and projectile trajectories will be generated.  The models and trajectories will be incorporated into an LCCM computer simulation, which will be employed to project navigation error statistics (e.g., CEP) for each candidate system.  Based on simulation results, performance/risk/cost tradeoff analyses will be conducted, and the most promising navigation system will be selected for fabrication and testing under the subsequent Phase II effort.",

T lymphocytes also participate in tumor and transplant rejection, auto immune disease, and hypersensitivity.  A central facet of T lymphocyte function is activation toward proliferation following exposure to specific antigen in the conted of the major histocompatibility complex on antigen presenting cells.  We proposed to develop a rapid assay based om the large and early increase in ATP in quiescent cells that are activated using Q fever as a model system.  Phase I or phase II antigen from C. brunetii, the causative agent for Q fever, will be added to whole blood samples diluted in buffer.  After incubation, T lymphocytes or appropriate subsets will be separated and washed by immunomagnetic beads coated with either antibody to a marker found on all T lymphocytes or to antiboldy to CD4 or CD8.  The lymphocytes will be disrupted and the ATP measured by addition of luciferin/luciferase.  Antigen specific response will be measured relative to a buffer control and to a T cell mitogen.  The proposed method offers a rapid, simple, and sensitive alternative to standard methods of monitoring T cell function.  The potendtial sensitivity of the test is based on the large increase - upto 1000 fold - of ATP in stimulated cells and the high quantum efficiency of the luciferin-luciferase reaction.  The method also offers the potential to measure activation of several subsets of T lymphocytes.  After a prototype assay is developed, the test will be validated against standard tests and by study of patients with Q fever.",

Previous experimental studies have demonstrated on a preliminary basis the ability to estimate liquide pH in complex biological matrices based on NIR spectra [Dre 90][Sch 93], and the proposed development program will design, contruct and test an experimental bench NIR pH measurement.  Biotronics has also demonstrated on a previous and related Navy-sponsored SBIR program, designated TAMM for Transcutaneous Analyte Measuring Method, tested over 750 patients in Navy and civilian hospitals with a reflective NIR instrument for the measurement of the primary human body electrolytes:  sodium, chloride, calcium, potassium and bicarbonate.  The physical principle involved in these NIR measurements is the same as for pH - ionic distortions of the primary NIR  water spectrum.  In fact, pH measurements represent a lesser challenge because of the greater density of the hydrogen ion in human tissue.  The bench prototype NIR instrument will be designed to operate in different NIR spectral regions to achieve varying depths of tissue penetration and to explore various spectral regions with a view to future spectral optimization in the Phase II preproduction prototype.  The previous successful biotronics TAMM experience with reflective NIR spectrometry and pattern recognition in noninvasive human blood electrolyte measurements bodes well for achieving the objectives of this program.  commercialization and military applicatiom of the new NIR pH instrument will follow the same paths now opened as a result of the Navy TAMM SBIR program.  Major impacts will be in military combat casualty care and civilian emergency medicine.",

        "abstract": "Liquid flow rate has been controlled in the past by varying flow area and differential pressure mechanically.  The pulse-width-modulated valves used for metering liquid fuel to the engine in the automotive industry are operating at engine cycle frequency and a low supply pressure.  The fuel delivered each cycle is proportional to the pulse width with constant flow area and differential pressure.  Higher operating frequency is desired when metering fuel to a combustor of a turbine engine, to dampen the pressure ripples created by the valve pulsation.  However, the fuel rate turn down ratio will become inevitably small and unacceptable.  Electronically controlled, variable area, cavitating venturi fuel control valves which have been used in the turbine engine industry, are expensive and relatively large.  The variable area is either produced by a dc motor or a movable servo-actuated pintle.  Liquid flow rate can be controlled by varying the flow area through pulse width modulation.  The flow rate will be directly proportional to the flow area which varies with pulse width, independent of pressure variation.  By exploiting the knowledge gained during the development of the Servojet Pulse Width Modulated gaseous fuel injector and the Proportional Pressure Relief Valve, the concept of controlling liquid flow rate by varying flow area through pulse width modulation without feedback position transducer, becomes feasible.",

In particular, sensors which enable the system to control and maintain the phase matching of the mirrored surfaces of adjacent segments to accuracies of a few nanometers are needed. Blue Line Engineering Co. proposes to develop a novel type of sensor which will be suitable for low cost mass production. Our goal is to provide optical systems designers with a the basic building blocks for constructing extremely low mass, highly agile, near diffraction limited segmented optical systems for use in broadband optical wavelengths. The approach, which will be described in detail in the proposal, utilizes devices which can produce and sense high gradient magnetic fields. The concept is also unique in that it is entirely composed of solid state devices and builds on mature commercial technologies. A research and development plan is presented in which the concept is analytically modeled, a prototype is designed, fabricated, and tested, and a production plan is generated. Potent commercial applications include both institutional and high end amateur astronomy markets, high performance imaging systems for both broadcast and government requirements, next generation optical computing systems, and beam control for laser communications. The low cost potential of the device will likely yield many other unforeseen applications.",

        "abstract": "A number of technical studies have concluded that the replacement of an aircraft's hydraulic systems with electrical actuation would result in substantial cost savings and increased reliability. Unfortunately, conventional electrical motors used in actuators have inherently low load capacity.  Therefore, mechanical force amplifiers such as gear trains or ball/roller screws are coupled to the motor.  These components add weight, compliance, and backlash; and increase maintenance and reduce reliability.  Improvement in electric motor power density through the use of rare-earth magnets or amorphous materials are only incremental.  This project is for the development of a Linear Motor Actuator (LMA) which is based upon redundant piezoelectric actuation.  The proposed LMA promises power densities beyond that possible with magnetic motors, rapid response, fail-safety, ease of scaling, and no energy consumption to maintain load and position.  The prototype scaled-down LMA to be fabricated and tested in Phase I of this project is based upon Bonneville Scientific's five years of experience in R&D on piezoelectric actuation for robotics. Phase I test results will be used in the design of the complete, full-size LMA and its associated computerized control system to be fabricated in Phase II of this project.",

        "abstract": "There has been a significant increase in the use of integrated-optic devices in military applications ranging from data communication and telecommunication networks to antenna remoting, missile guidance and various sensors and instruments.  To guarantee the reliability of all military systems which employ these devices it is crucial that they are evaluated in both real and simulated nuclear environments.  These components have also become attractive for a variety of commercial space applications, due not least to their low power consumption, compact size and lightweight.  Evaluation of device performance when subject to nuclear radiation is essential to prevent systems failures.  In Phase I of the SBIR program, Brimrose proposes to evaluate and compare the performance of various integrated-optic components before and after exposure to EM radiation.  In particular, characterizations will be made of optical waveguides, an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF) and an electro-optic modulator implemented on LiNbO3, the material most commonly used for the fabrication of integrated-optic devices.  The Phase I program will define some of the critical parameters of component integration and of acousto-optic and electro-optic interactions on LiNbO3  when exposed to gamma radiation.  This knowledge, coupled with our previous and on-going radiation studies of bulk-optic LiNbO3  devices, will enable integrated-optic components to be radiation hardened prior to system deployment.  On completion of the Phase II program, Brimrose will be in a position to design and fabricate radiation hardened integrated-optic components for use by both the DoD community and for commercial satellite applications.",

By taking the advantage of the almost perfect alignment of the conduction band in GaAsSb/InAlAs system, it is possible to integrate such quantum wells into a QWIPT to improve the optical gain and, therefore, the detectivity of the p-QWIP. We expect, by incorporating molecular beam epitaxy growth interruption scheme, to suppress background noise much further and greatly improve 77 K imaging array performance. The Phase I effort will be directed toward the realization of strain-balanced GaAsSb/InAlAs quantum wells. High-sensitivity, larger area (256x256 or larger) p-QWIP imaging arrays based on mature GaAs and InP processing technologies will be implemented in Phase II. The proposed design will enhance the emitter injection efficiency (in an npn phototransistor) and, therefore, improve the detectivity and optical gain. This technology should considerably speed the development of higher sensitivity, larger area, more reliable infrared detector components/arrays for defense application.",

Commercially available conversion coatings for aluminum and magnesium alloys often require the use of toxic, corrosive chemicals, and in some cases, sophisticated electrical equipment. The most effective ingredients in these anticorrosive products have traditionally been based on chromium compounds.  In order to achieve the same type of surface morphology and chemistry necessary for effective corrosion inhibition with chromium compounds, a novel pretreatment method is proposed.  This involves using peroxide precursors in combination with chromium-free co-oxidants to form stable mixed oxide layers over metal surfaces.  The novel combinations of metal surface active compounds will be incorporated into new types of sol-gel-derived chemical conversion coatings to suppression.  These properties will be tested on common nonferrous aircraft alloys by salt fog resistance and electrochemical impedance analysis.  The pretreatment systems are designed to be easily applied, to use no chromium compounds, and to form strong inter-layer bonds for durable coating adhesion.",

Using our modeling capability, we performed a brief computer analysis of the initial loading conditions for this long span roof framing system and found that a truss design can meet the loading requirements.  Truss structures use combinations of nearly pure compressive and tension members and provide large load carrying ability for minimal material. Considering this design approach, our technical objectives include: (1) Long span roof, based on truss design; (2) Light weight compression members based on element geometry and/or reinforced materials; (3) Pension members consisting of light-weight, high-strength cables; (4) Modular design, with the largest subcomponent no larger than 20 feet long, for ISO container compatibility; (5) Simple assembly procedures for assembly in the field by military personnel; (6) Incorporation of roof decking integral with the long span design.  In order to develop an optimal design, we have proposed to use Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) techniques to evaluate the use of different materials and different truss geometry.  This SBIR presented two completely different design approaches to provide examples of trusses that can support, and exceed, service loads of 500 lbs/ft2.  These example concepts also integrate roof decking within the design and show weight savings of over 136,000 lbs per span compared to conventional construction techniques and materials.  Our effort under this SBIR will be to develop structural models and use computer FEA to optimize component elements within a truss.",

The research will focus on determination of possible resolution with the dense network of reference receivers as applied to precision farming applications.  \"Resolution\" is defined as repeatability vs. accuracy at a location once a Differential GPS (DGPS) spot measurement has been made with the dense network of RR.  The improvement resolution offers potential innovative solutions to farmers faced with the need for increasing accuracy as a way of reducing labor, chemical and fertilizer costs and, at the same time, providing documentation for new regulatory requirements.  If sufficient resolution precision can be achieved, it can also provide the basis for guidance.\n\nGPS location measurement to 30 meters is possible in native mode and two meter accuracy is achievable over limited distance with DGPS, using a single RR.  GPS signals are affected by atmospheric signal propagation effects, satellite orbital erros, receiver noise, clock synchronization, etc.  The proposed research will determine resolution improvement with nullification of these errors, using correction data provided by a dense network of multiple RR.  The attainable precision will be mapped against agriculture requirements for guidance (e.g., tilling) and application systems (e.g., fertilizer, insecticide, herbicide).",

This diversity in calibration needs has made traceability of a physical reference impractical.  As a result, the NIST developed a procedure which can compare on-wafer calibrations to a NIST Benchmark GaAs TRL calibration.  In general, the measurement community recognizes the potential value of the procedure, but is unwilling to accept the investment of time and effort currently necessary to perform the procedure correctly.  The technical challenge is to develop new on-wafer calibration accuracy assessment tools which are easy to use, widely accessible, fast, and adaptable to changing calibration needs.  These accuracy assessment tools will automate wafer chuck and microwave probe positioning, vector network analyzer calibration, and calibration verification based on the NIST algorithms used in the DEEMBED and VERIFY programs.

Electronic manuals, particularly those which include interactive features, offer significant advantages over traditional hard copy manuals.  The current proposal seeks to enhance these advantages by incorporating features associated with the technology of immersed virtual reality.  Such features include the capability of immersing a technician in a three-dimensional interactive world. By allowing a technician to view and navigate within a virtual world, more substantial information regarding the subject matter can be imparted.  Use of the virtual reality option within a technical manual is expected to lead to a rapid as well as a more thorough understanding of the maintenance information.  The proposed effort is to establish a feasibility demonstration of the proposed technique.  The effort will include selection of a pertinent example manual, development of pertinent manual sections in the form of an interactive electronic technical manual, and the incorporation of software and hardware to provide virtual reality features.  CASDE Corporation's experience in maintenance procedures and the development of electronic technical manuals will be supplemented by the services of Professor Steven Feiner, noted computer graphics and virtual reality consultant.",

The CCVD method has been shown to inexpensively and quickly apply dense, adherent, epitaxial thin films in a continuous manner.  This technology can be used for the production of thermal control coatings onto spacecraft even after assemblage.  The CCVD method is low cost, high quality and versatile.  It does not require a reaction chamber or furnace, yet the thin films produced are comparable in quality to CVD films, and allows a deposition zone to be moved over a large area.  The deposition apparatus is lightweight and easier to manipulate than thermal spray devices.  The thin film multilayering capability of CCVD processing, which is not line-of-sight limited, is need to bring desired thin film heterostructure coatings to in situ applications. We have produced CVD quality films of numerous materials using CCVD in the open atmosphere without a furnace or reaction chamber.  In this project, thin films of thermal control coatings for spacecraft will be grown onto flat substrates and curved surfaces in the open atmosphere using CCVD.  The composition, morphology, microstructure, and absorbance and emittance properties of the films will be determined as a function of deposition conditions.  A series of run studies will be performed to optimize the process. This research will demonstrate the ability of CCVD to inexpensively deposit thermal control coatings for spacecraft with solar absorbance of less than 0.10 and thermal emittance of greater than 0.90.",

Additional merits include element shaping for transverse mode decoupling and reduced cross talk as well as multilayering for increased capacitance.  Combined with LTCC technology, integral PZT/substrate bond can be achieved with the necessary electrical interconnects and isolation. The fabrication of acoustic backing materials, e.g. W/recrystallizable glass composites, will be the basis for the development of additional functional materials including resistors, conductors and inductors, which can be integrated into the LTCC package, providing enhanced transducer performance, reliability and miniaturization.

This would permit programs to be designed and implemented in terms of diagrams, possibly data-flow diagrams. Whereas flow diagrams have been used for a while, it will now be possible to use them as actual programs, rather than just as program-development aids.  The visual-programming environment will encourage reuse of component programs, as functional blocks, to form larger programs, as tasks.  Given a \"library\" of such blocks, it should be possible for a scientist, engineer, accountant, or business manager to quickly form programs to meet specific needs.  Since each of the functional blocks has been thoroughly tested, the resultant program should be reliable.  It is also possible to treat such programs as blocks for a higher level of development.  The common paradigm for this is the design of integrated circuits, using libraries of pre-designed components so that the designer can easily put them together without worrying about details like molecular layers.  Computer  programs are more sophisticated.  We propose a visual-programming editor, a program database, and real-time interrupt-driven parallel processing to be part of the library development.",

        "abstract": "Lead-free, environmentally friendly ammunition will allow military training ranges to remain open.  Lead was an ideal bullet material, due to its high density (11.3g/cm(3)) and formability (Tm = 327 degrees C), but is no longer acceptable due to health concerns. However, the development of high density, nontoxic ammunition rounds has been advanced by engineered polymeric resins.  These resins have low densities, so fillers (powdered metals) have been incorporated into these polymeric binders. CeraNova proposes to mold ammunition using a ceramic carbide and other ceramics dispersed within polymeric resins.  One ceramic carbide @ 15.7 g/cm(3), is more dense than lead (11.4g/cm(3)).  A composite consisting of 63 vol% copper (8.29 g/cm(3)) and 37% polyetherimide (PEI) (1g/cm(3)) yielded a density of 6.0 g/cm(3). By replacing copper with carbides or other ceramics, at similar volume fractions, a density of 10.3g/cm(3) is possible. A 70% carbide/PEI composite will create a density of 11.3g/cm(3).  Many ceramic carbides are hard, dense, inexpensive, and chemically inert.  There are also many suitable polymer compositions. CeraNova will experiment upon a matrix of polymers and high density ceramics to develop low cost, high density, environmentally `green' ammunitions for .50 caliber, 7.62 mm rounds and nonmilitary applications.",

More reliable, lower power and less massive sensors are now possible by co-locating signal processing electronics on the sensor's wafer.  An innovative dual-function solid state sensor - the WADDAN Multisensor - fabricated in a silicon chip, is a good candidate to integrate with its signal conditioning electronics.  The resultant integrated sensor/electronics wafer will consume insignificant power, fit in approximately a one cubic inch capsule, and provide the performance necessary to navigate the AUV for extended periods between GPS position updates.  The technical challenges, objectives and tasks to successfully integrate the Multisensor with appropriate signal processing electronics and complete the AUV navigation system are articulated in this proposal.",

A key processing innovation is also made for fabrication of the corrugated flow channels by casting ceramic tapes by a doctor blade with a thermosetting resin binder, laminating them to a semicured state and pressing to a final shape in a mold.  The approach allows pressureless sintering of the flow channels instead of costly hot pressing.  The ability to pretest each ceramic component before assembly contributes to a high yield assembly of the ACHR.  Because of these features the ACHR is very inexpensive to manufacture.

Our proposed hybrid system offers several advantages. Expert system knowledge bases will be used to construct the decision hierarchy with neural network modules acting as classifiers at the nodes of the tree. Neural networks such as Fuzzy ARTMAP can be trained with ease and little computational effort. The proposed research extends the concept of self-organization from within the neural network outward to the overall structure of the decision hierarchy to support dynamic construction of an optimal decision tree. We will analyze the feasibility of the approach via demonstration and comparison with a previously developed ATR system. The military significance of our Phase I work includes adaptive and robust classification of potential targets given large quantities of features from preprocessed sensor data.  The commercial application will lead to a general supervised classification system capable of rapid decision making and dynamic reorganization of its internal structure. In addition to the planned use in our own intelligent agent software, applications also exist for the technology to speech processing and medical imaging systems. We also see commercial software applications via the development of a neural network/expert systems shell targeted to aerospace, electrical, mechanical and civil engineering.",

We propose to integrate two complementary technologies: ANNs and fuzzy logic (FL).  ANNs will be used to represent the complex hypersurfaces that define a helicopter's performance limits, and fuzzy logic will be used to perform limit detection and classification during operation.  Fuzzy logic will also be used to develop control augmentation logic for preventing limit exceedance.  The purpose of this hybrid system is to provide a helicopter and its pilot with real-time protection from performance limit exceedances that might lead to catastrophic failure, loss of control, or degrade airframe fatigue life.  The system will be designed to detect limit exceedances based on the patterns presented by the aircraft's state and control deflections.  Following development, a feasibility demonstration will be conducted using a limited-scope engineering simulation of an existing helicopter, providing a foundation for real-time evaluation under a Phase II effort.",

What is required is to find a method that can detect, classify, and engage targets using multisensor data in a timely, efficient manner and which is robust to countermeasures, environmental effects, and sensor limitations and constrains.  We propose a hybrid neural network/fuzzy logic/information processing approach for battlefield sensor fusion.  Our approach is based on successful results using a hybrid approach.  Our baseline Phase I effort will focus on development of a sensor database that includes sensor characteristics and capabilities versus mission requirements and identifies neural network/fuzzy logic implementation solutions.  Additionally, we propose an optional feasibility demonstration by developing and evaluating a prototype system.  Our hybrid approach to sensor fusion offers several advantages. Neural networks offer rapidly adaptable on-line solutions, capability to fuse multispectral channels and to detect and classify new threat classes, and implementation efficiency on emerging VLSI designs.  Fuzzy logic complements neural networks in sensor calibration, interpreting network outputs, detecting and classifying threats, fusing decisions from parallel neural and rule base classifiers, and incorporating ambiguous information. Information processing algorithms perform sensor measurement pre-processing, data alignment, feature extraction, an data association.",

However, defense and industry have been slow to adopt composites components, even in application areas where firm cost justification arguments can be made, because of inexperience with composite structure failure modes and the difficulty of routine NDE inspection.  The proposed development and testing activity will alleviate this problem by:  (1) providing a strong database relating NDE measurements with destructively analyzed composite structure failure modes (i.e. quantitative data relating measurable external phenomena with internal structural integrity of the composite components).  (2) providing validated NDE testing equipment on (1) above which eases customer acceptance of composite materials-based components by allowing easy on-site measurement of incoming and field-installed components to assure safety and reliability (quality assurance after installation, during operation, and after maintenance).  (3) supporting low cost, 100% routing inspection of composite components during and after the manufacturing process (quality assurance during and after manufacture).",

To enhance monitoring operations at night, the military often adds IR surveillance technology, as well as low light TV capability.  In all of these image-based monitoring activities, we expect a human operator to confirm intruder alerts before the intruder is close enough to be positively identified. Thus, positive confirmation requires personnel to issue verbal challenges to distinguish between intruders and authorized personnel.  We propose the alternative of providing authorization through an active transponding system which can be interrogated through existing image-based surveillance equipment, even when the personnel are located at extreme ranges.  This approach is compatible with visual and IR band surveillance imaging systems and also supports providing low cost IFF function to the individual soldier.",

        "abstract": "Attitude estimation of 3D objects is a necessary component of many of today's most difficult problems.  Currently White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) has an application in which they wish to use live imagery from multiple video sources to precisely determine the attitude or pose of missiles, aircraft, and submunitions as they pass through the field of view.  This proposal describes a system that solves this problem using an existing software package developed by the research team and leveraging off of the cost-effective trends in COTS parallel processing in the commercial market-place.  The Phase I effort will process imagery from WSMR in order to a) make the necessary system modifications to achieve desired performance and b) arrive at a real-time implementation design.  The required speed and throughput of the proposed system are aggressive, but achievable due to the extensive experience possessed by the research team in all required technical areas.",

        "abstract": "Transmittance pulse oximetry is currently the preferred method of noninvasive oxgenative monitoring.  However, this type of monitoring is limited with regards to peripheral probe placement, creating an inability to measure deep-tissue oxygenation to the level desired.  Recently reflective methods have been applied to pulse oimetry;  however, the reflected signal isdifficult to measure and interpret.  The reflective studies performed to date utilize individual probe placement and measurements schemes.  We propose an alternative approach invoking multiple probes fabricated to incorporate deep tissue oxygenation characterization in conjunction with surface assessment.  A volumetric profile will be established to formulate a more complete representation of systemic oxygenation - a profile with increased resolution and sensitivity. Associated experimental data integrated with theoretical analysis will assist in the formulation of a coherent mathematical model. Time resolved spectroscopy will be investigated using pulse sequencing as opposed to individual narrow pulses.  This approach will augment experimental tissue diffusion investigation.  The Phase I study will produce the sensor system design to best detect surface and deep tissue oxygenation noninvasively.",

        "abstract": "With the development of advanced technologies (including military weapons), more and more chemicals are employed, subsequently, more hazardous chemicals and chemical agents are generated (e.g.millions of pounds of military chemical wastes per year in USA).  Some of these chemicals related to military chemical wastes are phosphorus-based chemicals, chlorocarbons, and stimulants.  At present, these chemicals are treated by incineration at high temperature.  In the past, it is found that certain ultrafine (nanoscale), highly reactive metal oxide (e.g. CaO and MgO) could absorb these toxic chemicals and allow for reclamation of valuable byproducts as fuels or feedstock.  This technique is named as Destructive Absorption Technology (DAT).  In the proposed research, we will develop a low cost fabrication process for high surface area MgO powders.  The process proposed is the sol-gel based aerosol process in which the sol-gel solution reaction will be tailored to produce sparse clusters, and then the solutions will be used as the precursors for the aerosol process to produce high surface area MgO powders.  The powders will be tested for their destructive capacity using stimulants and chlorinated solvents as substrates, and the results will be correlated with the surface area and surface chemistry.",

        "abstract": "In this research, a TiO(2) ormocer-aerogel thickness film has been proposed.  The TiO(2) ormocer-aerogel can provide advantages both from ormocer and aerogel, such as superior mechanical and optical properties, large surface area, and high porosity.  Up to few hundred um thick of the TiO(2) ormocer-aerogel film can provide much larger surface than the TiO(2) colloidal films to deposit sensitized dye.  Much higher conversion efficiency and reaction rate can be expected.  The capability of the photocatalytic reaction can also be significantly increase.  The continuous network of the ormocer also provides better electronic contact than the colloidal films, better charge transfer between dye and TiO(2) catalyst is possible.  The hydrolysis between sensitized dye and ormocer can also provide crosslinking between dye and TiO(2) matrix, and better efficiency and stability can be expected.  One of the advantages of the sol-gel process is the molecular level mixing.  Therefore, doping effect on the TiO(2) ormocer-aerogel will also be studied in this research.  The activity of the metal or oxide dopants should be significantly improved as that has been in aerogel.  The interaction of the dopants and the sensitized dye will also be studied.  Transparent conductive electrode (ATO, ITO) can also be fabricated by the sol-gel process, which can further decrease the manufacturing cost of the photocatalytic reactor.",

The conventional optical system employs homogeneous materials which sometime are not sufficient to produce an adequate image. In this research, we propose to fabricate axial GRIN glasses via the layering of sol-gel solutions. The proper sol-gel solutions will be synthesized, the technique to form axial GRIN solutions will be identified and the conversion of the GRIN gels to the GRIN glasses will be investigated in this proposed research. The resultant axial GRIN lens will be characterized. This success will introduce new axial GRIN components into optical systems. The introduction of this novel GRIN lens will simplify the optical systems (reduction of number of lens) and improve the performance of the system (e.g. a missile guidance system). In addition, the introduction of these novel axial GRIN lens will benefit the development of small personal photocopiers, fiber optic communications, compact audio disk players, disk cameras, and medical endoscopes. The demonstrative investigation on Phase I will provide the basis for Phase II when the process is scaled up. In addition, the information and experimental data can be utilized to analyze the characterization results on the refractive index profile and to further optimize the process to achieve the desired index profile which will be performed in Phase II. The introduction of this novel GRIN lens will simplify the optical systems and improve the performance of the system (e.g. a missile guidance system).

The interface design will be based on explicit principles for design of voice interfaces which will in turn employ a state-transition-network representation of the current TAMPS graphical user interface (GUI) and a cognitive task analysis of mission planning performance.  The design process will also specify measurable design criteria and methods for estimation of the performance of cnadidate designs on these criteria.  Whereas airborne use of voice will be beneficial in permitting \"hands free\" interaction with the planning system, the goals of the initial ground-based application will be to provide intelligent assistance in interface navigation and also to enable off-line dictation of preliminary mission specifications.

        "abstract": "The research and innovation proposed here will use genetic technology and knowledge to produce a domestic dairy sheep strain productive under United States Southern Region and Third World conditions, while also generating new information about ewe management.  Dairying with sheep presents innovative economic opportunities to the sheep industry, and the number of dairy sheep operations is expanding.  A major limiting factor on dairy sheep production is the availability of dairy genetics.  Another limiting factor for the U.S. Southern Region is the inadequate use of tropically-adapted sheep breeds that tolerate heat and humidity, and possess high feed conversion efficiency and parasite resistance.\n\nIn Europe a dairy sheep breed exists with unsurpassed production traits.  The East Friesian dairy sheep has been successfully used in cross breeding programs in the Middle East and Europe.  The proposed research will import East Friesian embryos from Europe while at the same time performing lactation and metabolism studies on two tropically-adapted breeds:  the St. Croix and the Gulf Coast Native.  The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to develop one or two new synthetic strains of sheep that will possess both the excellent production traits of the East Friesian and the hardiness and adaptable qualities of the St. Croix of Gulf Coast Native.",

        "abstract": "The early detection of incipient failure in a Mechanical System is of practical importance as it permits scheduled inspections without costly shutdowns and indicates locations in need of repair before a system will incur any catastrophic failure. This project aims at the development of a comprehensive procedure to identify incipient mechanical faults and their propagations using acoustic signals. Considerable success has been already accomplished by the authors in identifying gear failures from both experimental and analytical vibration signals. Some success had also been achieved in correlating acoustic signals with system vibrations. However, extensive efforts in i) acoustic signal conditioning, ii) correlations between acoustic and vibration signals due to component damage, and, iii) development of pattern recognition and damage estimation procedures for acoustic signals, are required for the development of an accurate machine health monitoring system. In order to develop an accurate signature pattern recognition procedure, a complete database of the acoustic/vibration signals has to be generated. Experimentally validated numerical models will be developed to generate acoustic and vibration signal database for both normal and abnormal operating conditions. The main goals of this study are: a) development of a procedure to eliminate unwanted noise in the acoustic signal and to increase coherence with the vibration b) experimental examination of the applicability of acoustic sensors, c) correlation of acoustic signal with mechanical vibrations, feasibility study of using existing vibration monitoring techniques for acoustic data, and the development of a condition based prognostic procedure to predict component life.",

        "abstract": "Coccidiosis is one of the most important diseases of poultry worldwide.  Estimates of the cost to U.S. chicken production alone exceed $350 million dollars annually.  Since coccidia-free environments are unattainable in poultry houses it would be beneficial to identify the levels and species of Eimeria present so that severe infection, impaired feed conversion and production losses can be minimized.  This Phase I research plan proposed here will assess the feasibility of improving coccidiosis management through tests which combine the use of genus and species specific DNA detection to evaluate the level of infection in a flock via quantitative detection of Eimeria oocysts in fecal samples.  Chromagen's proprietary signal amplification technologies will be applied to the synthesis of highly fluorescent DNA probes which hybridize readily and specifically to their respective target sequences.  In addition, the sensitivity of time-resolved fluorescence will be utilized to make the assay effective for detection of Eimeria.  The Phase I effort will be divided into five areas of investigation: (i) development of procedures for sample collection and reproducible isolation of oocysts from fecal samples; (ii) quantitative extraction of sporozoite DNA; (iii) probe development; (iv) evaluation of the hybridization assay for sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility, and (v) instrumented detection and data management.",

This innovation will accept code and a user supplied operational distribution, and automatically assess the fault- tolerance of the software for inputs upon which the code is highly unlikely to be tested.  The innovation will automatically determine where additional fault-tolerant mechanisms are necessary, to ensure fault-tolerance throughout the software's life, not simply in the early stages of deployment.  The project objective is to show that such a tool is feasible and the model is theoretically sound, and the anticipated results of this effort are a detailed design for the tool.",

There are presently no proven or accepted mehtods for prevention or treatment of IHN.  Under the intensive culture conditions of aquaculture, IHN virus (IHNV) can cause significant losses at nearly all stages of production.  The results from preliminary studies suggest that intraspecific variation for IHNV resistance exists in rainbow trout, steelhead, and reciprocal corsses and this may be useful in breeding used to enhance for this trait.  In addition to evaluating select crosses for IHNV resistance, molecular approaches will be used to identify genes associated with resistance.  We anticipate demonstrating the feasibility of using PCR based RAPD analysis to identify unique genetic differences between trout groups differing in the IHNV susceptibility phenotype and to develop an initial set of markets for detailed genetic analyses during the second phase of these studies.",

The chromic oxide will then be transformedby aluminothermic reaction into commercially-viable pure aluminothermic chromiummetal, using procedures developed in a previous EPA research contract.Aluminothermic chromium metal sales will be directed at the national non-ferrousfoundry industry.  This transformation of an environmentally harmful, hazardous,sludge into an environmentally acceptable industrial product is technicallyfeasible and commercially attractive.

Comparison between simultaneous data from the two types of radar has never been made, but quantitative differences have been observed in currents measured by a SeaSonde and a phased-array radar deployed in the same location at different times.  We suggest that the differences are caused by antenna distortion due to their nearby surroundings.

These methods will be applied to currents measured by co-located systems of the two types.  We will use the NOAA/ETL SeaSonde operating at the Long Marine Laboratory in Santa Cruz, California and a phased array radar owned jointly by the University of Michigan, Stanford University and ERIM.

        "abstract": "High power diode-pumped 2 micron lasers are of great interest for a variety of lidar applications, including long range hard target tracking and space-based coherent laser radar systems operating in the eye-safe region of the spectrum. Lidar modeling suggests that 0.5-1 J/pulse energies at pulse repetition frequencies of about 40 Hz will be sufficient to meet many lidar mission requirements. CTI has recently conceptualized novel approaches to the development of efficient 2 micron lasers, and propose to extend current medium energy development work to the high pulse energy/high average power regime. Our numerical models indicate that a 0.5 J/pulse laser operating at 40 Hz repetition frequency (20W average power) with an electrical-to-optical efficiency of 5-10% in a simple oscillator configuration, is feasible to build with off-the-shelf components available today. This is a significant advance over realistic estimates of conventional oscillator/amplifier configurations. Key features of the novel designs are described in the proposal. During Phase I we propose to make detailed model calculations of laser performance, and provide a conceptual design of a demonstrator system. Efficient high power lasers will find uses as transmitters in lidar systems and as freestanding units. Lidar applications (long-range/high altitude wind mapping from the ground, in-situ high-altitude turbulence measurements, flood illumination imaging, etc.) exist for reduced eye hazard, high energy, high efficiency laser sources. The proposed lasers will also be well-suited for medical applications, as well as industrial applications. The laser will also prove useful as a 2 micron pump source for optical parametric oscillators operating in the 2 to 9 micron spectral range for DIAL applications.",

The latter must take all or most of the required vaporizer heat from that rejected by the intercoolers and/or other flowpath coolers.  Water is rejected as the Rankine cycle fluid, and organic heat transfer fluids are the only  alternatives.  The first task is to choose from available fluids one or two having the best combination of properties. Dowtherm J and Fluorinol-85 are strong candidates.  Using one of these, the bottoming cycle combined with a topping unit based on CECs' Regenerative Feedback Turbine Engine (RFTE) is simulated to determine approximate performance and size of vaporizer/cooler, condenser, and turbine expander.  Next make engine performance estimates and preliminary layouts of selected engine configuration. The RFTE based topping unit will result in compact low-emissions combined cycle engines of high efficiency (.46 to .55) and specific power (680-820).  The commercial market for engines of such capabilities is enormous and the  military market is quite significant.

        "abstract": "Ceramics offer higher temperature capability, lower density, and higher fatigue lifetimes compared to bearing steels.  Low damage tolerance and fracture toughness of ceramics has eliminated their consideration for bearing raceways.  Colorado Engineering Research Laboratory (CERL) is proposing a completely new fabrication technology to make Si*3*N*4* ceramic-matrix composite (CMC) bearing rings with a core-reinforcement of SiC cloth or Nb screen while maintaining an unreinforced Si*3*N*4* surface-case.  The innovation involves centrifugal casting of a ceramic slurry (Si*3*N*4* powder with integral co-precipitated sintering aids) through a porous tube which has woven SiC or Nb architecture on its outside surface.  The very high centrifugal accelerations will induce complete infiltration through the reinforcement interstices, resulting in dense CMC rings after sintering.  CERL will initially perform centrifuge trials to establish the best: (1) Si*3*N*4* powder-to-binder ratio, (2) spinning rate, and (3) reinforcement interstice size, that will result in high density material. Larger-scale CMC rings will be fabricated using the best processing parameters and fracture toughness will be measured from ring specimens.  This technology will enable the fabrication of high-toughness Si*3*N*4* bearing raceways for turbine engine applications, which has not been successfully demonstrated to date.",

The approach is based on extensions of well proved and established technology currently in routine use for multiphase, chemically reacting and turbulent solid rocket motor exhaust plume analyses.  Latest advances in the modeling of multiphase phenomena from the field of transient, solid propellant interior ballistics are also brought to bear upon the FAE problem.  Recent developments in large eddy simulation (LES) of turbulence from the field of high speed jets and transient liquid propellant gun interior ballistics provide a physically realistic approach for representing large scale turbulent structures in FAE clouds.  The overall FAE modeling framework is constructed around a well proven, unsteady, three-dimensional, finite-volume, CFD code called CRAFT.  CRAFT utilizes a fully implicit, upwind scheme with higher order spatial and temporal accuracy to provide for robust shock capturing without spurious oscillations and good resolution of other embedded discontinuities (e.g. flame fronts, limiting particle streamlines, etc.). The overall modeling framework provides a unique capability for a variety of transient, particulate-laden, combusting flowfields.",

The zoom range is to be 4X, with focal lengths from 50 to 200 mm and angular field coverages from 5 to 20 degrees.  The first approach is the design of an advanced Mechanically Compensated IR Zoom Lens.  This design based on  prior COI 4X zoom lenses offers the most direct engineering design solution.  The second approach is the development of an Optically Compensated IR Zoom Lens.  This design concept has the potential of many advantages since it has only one moving part, and offers a simpler and lighter lens construction with greater reliability.  A detailed optical tolerance analysis will be carried out for both types, including the effects of all element thicknesses and separations; as well as thermal effects and manufacturability.",

Further work by the PI, since joining Concept ETI, included the programming of advanced data reduction algorithms, a graphical user interface, and the application of recently developed electronics for dramatic improvements in speed, accuracy, usability and cost.  The proposer will thoroughly research the diagnostic and prognostic needs of the sponsoring agency and the gas turbine community.  Recent advanced in optics and electronics will be investigated.

The bending of a cantilever can be detected with sub-nanometer sensitivity using the tunneling current detection technique. Calculations based on geometrical and material properties show that a temperature difference of 10-6 K can be easily measured using such microcantilevers.

The goal of this project is to couple new and innovative computational techniques into Continuum Dynamics, Inc.'s RotorCRAFT/AA analysis to address these issues while also allowing the user to easily adjust the physical fidelity of the computational methods to be employed for maximum efficiency.  In Phase I, two novel computational methods will be employed for maximum efficiency.  In Phase I, two novel computational methods will be incorporated into the present model. The first is a recently developed compressible panel treatment of the lifting surface that will improve the resolution of unsteady subsonic flow configurations.  The second, and more ambitious innovation, is a recently developed higher-order compact Euler CFD technique suitable for capturing concentrated vorticity as well as modelling detailed transonic flow phenomena.  Once incorporated, this Euler technique will form the basis for a full Navier-Stokes analysis of the flow over the blade.  The final product will be a fast, reliable and efficient software package suited for rotor design and analysis that is capable of simulating rotor/wake systems over the full range of relevant airspeeds and flight conditions as user-selected levels of sophistication and calculation speed.",

Additionally, the AF is pursuing NOx reduction credits wherever it is feasible.  To achieve both of these goals, CTI is proposing to develop a particulate converter/exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system for emission reduction.  The particulate converter system is an innovative passive exhaust after treatment device for the separation and incineration of diesel particulate employing and advanced method for incinerating particulates.  The EGR hardware is designed to achieve highest NOx reduction, taking advantage of the converter to reduce the additional particulate emissions.  Phase I calls for the development and construction of a particulate converter/EGR prototype for a heavy-duty truck for the AF.  The prototype will be first tested for emission and operability at CTI's facility.  Then it will be tested at an independent emission test facility.  CTI is targeting 90% reduction in particulates/smoke, 30% reduction in NOx, 70% reduction in HC, and 80% reduction in CO.  Higher emission reductions are targeted for Phase II.",

The Ferro-Disk stores data in the form of electric remnant polarization in a ferroelectric film. Because ferroelectric materials are radiation hardened, the Ferro-Disk is specially suitable for reliable data storage during space missions. The architecture a Ferro-Disk data storage system makes innovative use of ferroelectric thin film technology and optical data storage technology. The data storage density of a single layer Ferro-Disk is compatible or higher than that of a magneto-optical drive, limited only by the spot size of the writing laser beam. Because of the thin film nature of the ferroelectric recording media, multilayer data storage can easily be realized to further increase the data storage density. CoreTek's design of electric readout leads to a robust drive with much simpler optical configuration than a conventional optical drive. The simplicity of system design ensures the Ferro Drive to be reliable and compact with very low power consumption. Phase I will fabricate the proposed Ferro-Disk by using sputtering thin film deposition technique. We will evaluate the data storage characteristics of the Ferro-Disk by examine reading and writing process. Phase II will optimize the device performance to achieve specifications better than the present day disk-drives. Compared with conventional data storage systems (tape system, magnetic hard disk, optical disk), the Ferro-Disk has the following advantages: high read/write speed, high data storage density, simple and compact system design, low power consumption, resistant to radiation damage, and extremely robust. This new and revolutionary data instrumentation scheme will be of considerable importance for military as well as commercial applications.",

        "abstract": "The rapid development of the technology for producing high quality single crystal SiC wafers and thin films presents the opportunity to fabricate solid-state devices with power-temperature capability far greater than devices currently available. While conventional silicon power devices are already being used near their limits of operating temperature and power, the potential of SiC is just beginning to be demonstrated. Vertical power MOSFET structures fabricated in 4H-SiC with 150 V capability have already shown current densities of 100 A/cm2 with a voltage drop of 3.3 V (specific on-resistance of 33 m -cm2. These devices showed good characteristics at temperatures up to 300 C. 4H-SiC  thyristors have been demonstrated up to 500 C that block 200 V and have current densities of 500 A/cm2 at 3.8 V. While these are promising results, these devices have been far from reaching their theoretical voltages based on the doping levels used. One of the reasons for the relatively low voltages is the lack of good junction termination techniques for SiC. Therefore it is proposed that different junction termination designs and processes be explored and evaluated. The Phase I effort will focus on the application of these terminations to relative simple pn junction rectifiers. The methods to be evaluated will be improved passivation of mesa sidewalls and the use of non-mesa terminations such as floating field rings or field plates. A batch of identical pn junction structures will be grown on which these different methods will be used so that they can be systematically compared. The surface breakdown of SiC will also be characterized because of its importance in achieving higher power Sic microwave MESFETs, which are becoming vital for next generation phased array radar systems. The termination techniques for the rectifiers and the surface breakdown information can then be applied to more complex SiC devices currently being developed such as power MOSFETs, thyristors, and microwave MESFETS. High power silicon carbide devices which operate at high temperatures are required for a variety of power conditioning applications on radar systems, all-electric airplanes, turbine engine actuators, and space-based power systems.

The larger bandgap of GaN offers several performance advantages in the realization of UV detectors.  Devices can operate at high temperature, dark currents are many orders of magnitude smaller, and response can be solar-blind.  UV detectors have already been fabricated at Cree research in the 6H polytype of SiC for the USAF.  These devices exhibit a 96% quantum efficiency with a peak responsivity at 270 nm.  The pn junction leakage currents were found to be 10(super4) - 10(super5) times smaller, with sensitivities up to 10(super4) times greater than for common Si based UV photodetectors.  However, these devices required the use of an external filter for solar blind operation.  We propose expanding on this work by fabricating UV photodetectors in GaN and AlGaN alloys.  The wider bandgap energies available with these materials will move the detector response to shorter wavelengths, permitting solar blind operation without the use of external filters.  In Phase I , the use of existing GaN and AlGaN epitaxial growth, fabrication and testing technology available at Cree, will permit rapid fabrication and evaluation of the performance advantages offered by these materials.",

It may be possible to reduce both of these problems by growing crystals at lower temperatures (below the phase transition temperature).

The benefits of this program will be the preparation of a new material with very large nonlinear optical properties.

Innovative performance metrics will be developed that are specifically tailored to the control of structure-borne sound.  These include exploiting simultaneous sensing and actuation for collocated control and the use of shaped sensors for the remote measurement of volume velocity.  Efficient algorithms will be developed for the optimal placement of multiple sensors and actuators.  Efficiency is the key issue due to the expansive search space that exists in a multiparameter optimization for reducing sound radiation from structures. The Phase I work plan consists of determining placement algorithms and metrics for broadband acoustic and vibration control, deciding on the level of spatial filtering needed for effective sound attenuation, and selecting a control approach which is computationally efficient robust to model errors.  A hardware demonstration will be performed in the Phase I option to evaluate the techniques.  The final product of the Phase I effort will be an experimentally validated placement algorithm for the active control of sound.",

The resultant volume reduction of the electronics assembly allows it to be easily located within the motor frame; a very thin spray assembly and integral liquid pump are also contained therein.

However, such high performance can be extracted only over short time pulses because the devices produce a moderate amount of heat at extremely high heat fluxes.  The bottleneck towards running steadily at peak conditions is that the heat generation is too high to be dissipated by currently used heat sinks (conduction heat sinks with or without fans).  Hence, there is a need to develop a compact high heat flux cooler.  A key problem is that this cooler must be very compact so that it does not impact the over all size of the solid-state system.  Cudo proposes a highly innovative integral pump/motor/heat exchanger that elegantly solves this problem.  This revolutionary design has resulted in the submission of two patents.  Never before has a pump, motor and heat exchanger been integrated into a single stand-alone unit.  This pump-motor-heat exchanger integration will reduce the size of the cooler by more than 6 times, thus, reducing costs and increasing portability and marketability significantly.  The objective of this study is to design, fabricate, test and deliver a market-ready prototype of the high heat-flux cooler which integrates the functions of motor, pump, cooler and heat exchanger info a miniature, compact stand-alone package.",

        "abstract": "This project represents the potential for a major advancement in helicopter fire fighting capability for forests and grasslands.  Although early work with helicopters attempted to maximize the quantity of water delivered for initial fire attack, the Light Aircraft Foam Application System (LAFAS) focuses on the precise delivery of quality foam-water mixtures, while retaining previous delivery quantities and rates.  The importance of foam was recently high lighted when it was revealed that water drops from aircraft have a temporary cooling effect on the fire but evaporation takes place rapidly and the fire resurges.  Foam, of appropriate thickness and quality, not only provides a cooling effect, but also blankets the fuel source, depriving the fire of oxygen.  LAFAS is a joint venture between Davis Technologies International, a quality engineering development organization, and CW Aerotech Services, with extensive experience in the development of high technology aeronautical projects.  The Phase I efforts of this project are centered on studying the design feasibility of integrating a new technology spherical pump and an advanced capability spray nozzling system into a candidate light helicopter.",

        "abstract": "Establishing interferon-a as a surrogate marker of viral infection will enable the differential diagnosis of viral vs bacterial infections.  Such information will be critical to subsequent treatments.  The current proposal is designed to evaluate CytImmune Science's patent pending technology for cytokine measurement in biological fluids.  The technology overcomes the presence of cytokine binding proteins in biological fluids, which mask their detection by sandwich immunoassays.  The assay system is a competitive binding immunoassay, which relies upon the competition of a cytokine ligand with standard or unknown for antibody binding.  The bound cytokine ligand couples to an enzyme, which is detected by the enzymatic conversion of a chromagen. This competitive binding reaction results in an inverse relationship between amount of color and the amount of analyte.  A key element of the present proposal is measuring clinical samples from virally-infected vs bacterially- infected patients, and determining IFNa levels with a laboratory-based assay system.  Secondly, the proposal then seeks to extend this laboratory-based technology to a hand-held field assay system.  The goal of Phase I is to initiate studies to show the equivalency of the semi-quantitative field test with the quantitative laboratory test.",

Recent advances allow analysis of practical sensor suites and more realistic scenarios.   Our pattern theoretic approach unifies the traditionally separate endeavors of detection, tracking, and recognition.  We postulate data likelihood models for sensors of interest.  A posterior distribution is obtained by combining these with a track motion prior generated by stochastic differential equations. Conditional mean estimates for empirically generating estimates of target positions and types are generated using a random sampling algorithm based on continuous and discontinuous stochastic processes.  New objects are detected and object types are recognized through discontinuous moves.  The location of objects are estimated via continuous processes.  The methodology outlined is universal and may be applied to any other sensor suite.  Such an approach lays the basis for detection, understanding, and recognition of targets in the complex battle scenarios which will face the military in the future.  We propose to implement these algorithms and analyses (theoretically and computationally) their ability to obtain and maintain lock under a variety of practical conditions, as well as their ability to handle the extreme conditions required in true use.",

Current technology provides for side looking sonar coross track resolution of a few centimeters, however, along track resolution is limited because of transducer radiation pattern and repetition rate.  We propose in phase I to verify feasiblity of a concept for implementation of a high repetition rate side looking sonar which would operate with multiple pings in th water simultaneously, allowing for greatly enhanced resolution.  The approach is based on binary PSK encoding of successive transmit pings such that echo data, being received simultaneously from several transmit pings, can be decoded and processed with correct alignment of data associated with each ping.  Such a technique will allow a combination of faster survey speeds and greatly improved resolution, an important advance for application in underwater mine location surveys.  Use of a Chirp swept FM transmit waveform with associated matched filter DSP receive processing will result in longer ranges achieved with high resolution.  The system concept also includes a digital multiplexor which allows control of all side scan functions, and transmission of acquired data through an RS-232 serial port, for interfacing with an external processor.  Use of a single wire I/O will allow for flexible expansion in the form of additional sensors which could include acoustic transmission of seafloor image data or perhaps processed target location data to the sea surface by acoustic telemetry.",

Deacon Research has developed a new nonlinear optical material which can efficiently produce the requires longer-wavelength radiation using frequency mixing with diode lasers as the pump sources. During Phase I we will build a difference frequency mixer, measure its performance, and use the results to predict the performance of an optimized mixer to be built in Phase II.

DRT's valve, operated by a simple vortex-tripping tab has been demonstrated in high speed pulsing of drilling mud in bore-hole telemetry systems and can vary its effective outlet area by more than 3:1.  Combined with the burn rate pressure sensitivity of a solid propellant gas generator, 10:1 flow/thrust modulation can readily be achieved.  An alternate concept, for those cases where the mass flow rate does not depend on chamber pressure, would use a chamber-pressure-bleed controlled, vortex valve designed to have an effective area variation in excess of 20:1, if desired.  (A pressure reduction upstream of the vortex chamber would be needed to ensure a control pressure higher than the vortex supply pressure.)  Actuation would be achieved using very low cost NASA-developed Rainbow piezo-electric benders to modulate the tab position or, in the case of flow-controlled valve, the control flow.  These benders, capable of displacing 0.5 mm with several pounds of force in less than 200us, would cost less than $5 in production quantities.  Projected production cost of the complete valve assembly, fabricated from molybdenum or TZM, including a PC interface is anticipated to be less than $1000 in quantities of 1000.  In Phase I, an Inconel, brassboard system will be designed, built and tested on cold gas and the necessary hardware and software to support five hot gas tests will be provided to MICOM for evaluation.

        "abstract": "The determination of the angular orientation of a radar or electro-optic assembly almost always involves the use of gyros. Except for very crude applications, gyros are always used in conjunction with accelerometers, their combination being referred to as an Inertial Measurement Unit or IMU. Gyro performance is typically related to cost. However the deterministic errors that lower gyro performance, can be estimated by fusing data from an IMU with data (principally velocity) from GPS. Once the errors are estimated they can be compensated for, resulting in enhanced gyro performance. Thus substantial cost reductions can be achieved because lower cost/performance gyros can be used instead of what would typically be required for a given level of performance.",

        "abstract": "A major problem in maintaining complex weapon systems is determining when a particular component needs repairing or replacement. Current diagnostic techniques in practice are often simplistic and can lead to premature replacement of components or, more seriously, failure to replace or service malfunctioning components. Avionics components undergo various stresses that ultimately limit their useful life. No single parameter provides sufficient information for proper analysis. DESE Research, Inc. proposes the use of new and innovative embedded microelectric and microelectromechanical sensors combined with the DESE Life Assessment System (LAS) to create a system that accurately predicts remaining life of key components and thereby supports improved system reliability, availability, maintainability (RAM) and mission effectiveness at significantly reduced cost. The proposed LAS will collect and process data involving numerous pertinent parameters and report expected remaining life for components of interest. In this proposed effort, an avionic system will be selected and analyzed, pertinent parameters will be identified, appropriate sensor technology will be chosen, LAS will be adapted to the selected avionics system, and a conceptual model and validation plan will be developed. The ultimate result will be a highly reliable diagnostic system that indicates needed maintenance actions based on specific, multi-parameter data.",

Iconic operation will allow minimal operator input for difficult and error prone operations such as creating vehicles that change direction and speed, or positioning perspective LOS of moving clouds.  The 3D visualization environment allows realistic scenario development and presentation of module outputs (e.g. clouds) in highly rendered animations.  Terrain features (bushes, tundra, farmland, roads) will be automatically mapped onto the landscape. A novel capability we propose is the ability to view the 3D environment at specified wavelengths (as the sensor would \"see\" it).  Sophisticated plotting provides 2D and 3D plotting with minimal operator input.  For example, users can easily obtain color graphic plots to determine how the extinction for LOS 3 varies in the 3-5 band and the 8-12 band as a function of time.",

This novel approach appears promising given the success of the ERM vaccine and that cloned IPN virus (IPNV) proteins expressed in the bacteria Escherichia coli have protected fish against IPN in laboratory trials.  Cloning and expression of foreign proteins in Y. ruckeri has not been previously attempted.  In the proposed research, two strategies, using an E. coli plasmid and a broad host range plasmid, will be evaluated for obtaining the stable expression of immunogenic IPNV proteins by Y. ruckeri.

Second, the particulate effluent of gas turbine engine testing facilities and jet aircraft represent pollution sources that requires quantifiable and potential modification. Again, the particulate size distribution function and number density are required. Currently, the ability to measure these parameters is limited to the use of extraction probes which suffer from sampling efforts, is time-consuming, and is, therefore, expensive in its operation.

The full system will handle currents up to 200,000 A for low- voltage (less than 1,000 V) DC or AC power distribution. The innovative geometry of the proposed cables, interconnections, and joints theoretically eliminates magnetic signatures by inherently cancelling the magnetic field due to each conductor. This state-of-the-art design will minimize magnetic detection by mines and enemy reconnaissance equipment, decrease fastening requirements by reducting magnetic forces and eliminate possible biological side effects on personnel. In Phase 1, Diversified Technologies, Inc. (DTI) will design and build and test scaled-down 2,000 A prototype hardware for feasibility studies and proof of concept. In the Phase I Option program, DTI will study the tradeoffs and problems of paralleling multiple bus cables to design a 20,000 A power distribution system. Fabrication of a 200,000 A prototype system will take place during Phase H.",

In pepper fruit, endo-Beta-1,3-glucanase expression is dramatically induced as the fruit ripens, hence we have set out to test the role of this activity in the ripening and senescence of the pepper fruit.  Genetically engineered pepper plants with >90% reduction of fruit endo-Beta-1,3-glucanase have been produced.  The proposed research is to evaluate whether these hemicellulase-suppressed fruits have altered ripening/senescence properties when compared to normal fruit.  Ripening and softening rates will be measured in fruit which are left on or off the vine during and after ripening.  The effect of reduced hemicellulase on the post-harvest storage life of pepper fruit will also be measured.  In addition to whole tissue measurements of color and softness we will perform cell wall analyses on pericarp extracts from a range of different developmental stages to establish a role for the endo-Beta-1,3-glucanase activity.",

        "abstract": "We propose to develop a lightweight armor applique that ensures survivability against both shaped charge (CE) and kinetic energy (KE) threats. In previous DARPA-sponsored efforts, we developed a unique armor package capable of defeating these threats. KE defeat was obtained by inducing a rotational motion in the penetrator, with final penetration limited to the penetrator's diameter. This design approach was better suited to heavy armor threats. In the proposed effort, we will apply design features of the heavy armor system to ensure erosion of the penetrator within the armor module. CE Defeat will be produced by conventional flyer-plate wiping. KE defeat will be obtained by projecting flyer-plate material into the penetrator's path. Simple explosive logic will be used to optimize the arrival of plate material. This feature will minimize the plate material required to erode the penetrator threat.",

The key technical issues will be motion compensation, development of appropriate autofocus algorithms, and suppression of shallow water noise.  DTI is currently developing a state-of-the-art SAS for ARPA and has created a unique set of design and simulation tools; in particular, a high fidelity end-to-end SAS/SLS simulator that incorporates all system components and signal processing.  This simulation will serve as the primary analysis tool to assure a high-confidence Phase II prototype.

Loop Heat Pipes, developed in the former Soviet Union, offer the design engineer another alternative, one which combines the reliable, self-starting features of the heat pipe, with the high heat transport capacity and antigravity capabilities of Capillary Pumped LOOPS. The attractive performance attributes of the Loop Heat Pipe have been well established in systems containing a single evaporator and condenser. In order to increase its applicability as an effective thermal management tool, the capabilities of the device must be expanded to interconnect multiple payloads and sinks. The primary goal of the proposed program is to develop a Loop Heat Pipe thermal bus (LHPBUS) with multiple evaporators and condensers that retains the reliable, self-starting behavior of its singular thermal interface counterparts. A breadboard system will be designed and fabricated in Phase I. Demonstration tests will characterize its performance capabilities, and the test results will be used to update/validate analytical models. A reliable, self-starting, high capacity LHPBUS would be used for both government and commercial satellites and space platforms. The LHP's flexibility, and high antigravity capability, would also support terrestrial heat transport applications. A LHPBUS, equipped with suitable thermal interfaces, could find widespread use as a \"thermal extension cord\".",

For ELINT, the receiver offers rapid collection and analysis capability and may significantly reduce data collection time and associated costs.  For ESM, the Adaptive Matched Filer is valuable for rapidly locating and classifying those emitters not processed by conventional radar warning receivers (RWRs).

During Phase I, Dynetics will select the best approach and perform the preliminary design of the Channelized Direction Finding System.

        "abstract": "Dynetics proposes an innovative combination of analog and digital technology to produce a Lock-In Acousto-Optic correlator for application in pulse-coupled neural networks. Our unique approach uses a time-integrating optical correlator and high-speed, two-dimensional digital processing for matched filtering of repetitious waveforms of unknown pulse repetition frequency (PRF). Dynetics' proposed approach is beneficial for the following reasons: 1) the correlator optimizes signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regardless of PRF, 2) the correlator is reprogrammable for any waveform type 3) the processor operates in very low SNR environments, and 4) the correlator rapidly locks onto the PRF using a non-iterative algorithm. By combining a neural network image processor and a Lock-In Acousto-Optic Correlator, a new product would be available for many facets of image recognition. A well-recognized commercial market for image recognition processors already exists in the areas of manufacturing and quality control.  Dynetics is confident that the Lock-In Acousto-Optic Correlator can be developed using low cost components, making the final product marketable. In this proposal, Dynetics describes a Phase I effort that will provide a convincing demonstration and will lay the groundwork for achieving commercialization in Phases II and III. ANTICAPTED BENEFITS: The development of a combined pulse-coupled neural network and Lock-In Acousto-Optic Correlator would significantly impact both Government and commercial users because of the long established need for image recognition devices.

MEAs will rely on electrically based power systems to supplant the present combination of hydraulic, pneumatic, mechanical, and electrical subsystems, all of whose power are extracted from the main aircraft engines.  However, a considerable battery energy storage capability will be needed for decentralized and backup (safety) power as well as power conditioning (load leveling) applications.  Consequently, viable battery candidates will be characterized by high energy storage content and high power delivery abilities.  The nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH)system is now under study as a superior candidate for a wide range of applications, including such high power commercial applications as hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs).  Electro Energy, Inc. is presently developing a patent-pending bipolar version of the Ni-MH system, based on the use of conductive polymers.  This advanced design yields high energy density of 60-70 Wh/kg, a significant improvement above present conventional technologies.  In addition, the bipolar geometry is especially well suited to high current density applications.  The proposed project is directed at development of a high power version of this system that would ultimately yield power densities on the order of 200 W/kg. This will involve the development of both improved hydride materials with higher rate capability as well as optimization of cell components to minimize cell resistivity.",

It is the objective of this proposed Phase I program to explore two candidate stack configurations, both of which have high potential for significant weight reduction over the conventional bi-polar plate configuration.  These configurations were chosen from the results of preliminary stack weight analysis and compared to the weight of a conventional bi-polar plate configuration.  Weight savings of over 35% are apparent.  One configuration in particular utilizes existing fuel cell material as starting materials, and it is anticipated that this effort will be highly successful.  The development of both configurations will be conducted in parallel until the time that an overall technical assessment can be made. One configuration will be selected to be fabricated into a 3 cell demonstration stack to finally evaluate its function in a stack environment.

        "abstract": "We propose a novel design for two dimensional steerable millimeter wave (MMW) antennas. The design consists of an array of microstrip patch antennas deposited on a ferrite substrate. Since the radiation/scattering pattern from a ferrite element is related to the magnetization state of the ferrite, the radiation profile resulting from an antenna array consisting of ferrite elements is therefore a function of the applied external magnetic field. It has been shown in the past that one dimensional steerable beams may be generated through the use of corrugated ferrite image lines or ferrite disc scatterers. We have also shown recently that two dimensional beam steering is possible by the use of a two dimensional ferrite patch antenna array. The steering rates in these two cases were about the same. Two dimensional steerable ferrite patch antennas will be fabricated and optimized for conformal array applications. We propose that ferrite patch antennas will be used in automotive sensing system for collision avoidance. By exploiting unique features of ferrite patch antennas, such as circular polarization and frequency modulation, our proposed work will provide the following advantages: sensitivity, target recognition, signal identification, and distance and speed characterizations.",

A method is required to economically and thoroughly evaluate and analyze the propulsion control system without risking expernsive, one-of-a-kind, prototype propulsion systems.  Electronic Concepts and Engineering Inc. proposes to develop a real-time simulator to emulate tactical propulsion systems.

The simulation software will interface through PC I/O cards to an external electrical signal conditioning module which interfaces with the control system being analyzed. The expected result of this Phase I program is a functional, real-time, propulsion system simulator which models the dynamics of a single shaft turbojet engine and performs a post-simulation analysis of the system's response. In addition to the development of real-time, computer based, tactical missile turbojet engine simulators, the personnel assigned to this program have several years experience developing real-time propulsion system controls for ARPA, the U.S. Army, and commercial concerns.

        "abstract": "One of the keys to the potential widespread adoption of Virtual Reality (VR) technology is the development of greater levels of image realism. Electronic Design, a small business in New York State, proposes to investigate a new approach for dramatically advancing VR realism through the development of a high speed graphics engine based on optical ray tracing. An innovative architecture eliminates recursion overhead and provides constant rendering time per polygon, overcoming the major computational hurdles to real-time deployment of ray tracing. The capabilities of the ray tracing engine are not limited to visual image rendering, but can also be used to simulate the behavior of infrared sensors, radar systems, sonar, and radio communications  systems. During Phase 1, Electronic Design will prove the feasibility of the proposed ray tracing engine via a software prototype that will benchmark the throughput that can be achieved in first generation hardware. The long term goal is to commercialize a low cost product that plugs into computer workstations and is used to enhance VR or other graphics applications. The proposed approach has been reviewed and endorsed by recognized experts in the VR community with backgrounds in both military and commercial applications.",

        "abstract": "Several benefits result from variable-speed capability in mobile engine generators with high frequency alternators (\"HFAs\") and power frequency converters (\"PFCs\").  The two primary benefits are increased power through higher engine speeds and increased efficiency through use of the optimal speed in tracking loads.  The variable-speed units now available indicate that substantial improvements are possible, but they also raise questions about which HFA and PFC alternatives are the best.  EPC will identify all practical alternatives and characterize them in a two-dimensional evaluation matrix that lists important characteristics versus alternative.  The matrix will be prepared for power ranges of 5 to 30 kw, 30 to 100 kw and 100 to 1000 kw.  In filling out the matrices, EPC will draw on its extensive experience with advanced power converters, variable-generation systems and its relationships with other companies with pertinent expertise.  The matrices will lead to favored HFA and PFC alternatives.  Although the result cannot be predicted now, a likely outcome is a HFA in the form of a permanent magnet generator and a PFC in the form of a resonant converter using MCTs.  In an optional portion of the project, EPC will develop a workplan for Phase II in which prototypes will be assembled and tested.",

The compression technique must permit diagnosis by both human experts and machine-based ATR. Irreversible coding will be developed for real-time processing at rates higher than video.  The reversible coding to be applied to lower-rate data will employ either block DCT or multiresolution DWT.  Off-the-shelf digital hardware such as Datacube image processors will be used to implement the algorithms.  In Phase 1, the compression methods will be tested both for the tracking of missile hard-body feature and for the automatic classification of skin lesions based on R, G, B image sequences representing clinical data.  In Phase 2, the methods will be developed further and will be tested for real-time handover and aimpoint algorithms, and for early management of wounds and burns.",

Furthermore, EOS proposes to assess the applicability of laser devices developed by Phillips Laboratory for elevation measurements of wounds to burns with structured illumination.  EOS proposes this system as a new tool for: (1) quantitative monitoring of changes in lesions, burns, or wounds over time (e.g. in area, elevation, color, etc.); (2) reliable screening of the general population for skin cancers, including melanoma; (3) early burn diagnosis; and (4) wound healing assessment.  The proposed effort will build on EOS's current efforts in development of sensor hardware and digital image processing for classification of skin lesions and will extend it to wound healing assessment and automatic burn classification.  During Phase I, EOS will develop a hyperspectral sensor for imaging wounds and burns, select the optimal wavelength for elevation measurements, and design a commercial multiresolution system for lesion classification.  During Phase II, two prototypes will be built and delivered to our medical collaborators who will acquire clinical image data on wounds and burns.  EOS will use these data for development and testing of algorithms.",

        "abstract": "The cavity perturbation method is currently widely used for the characterization of the complex dielectric constant of material samples.  This method provides a simple analytical solution by relating the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant of the sample to the changes in the measured resonant frequency and the quality factor of the loaded cavity.  The validity of this method, however, is contingent upon the small size of the dielectric sample.  For low-loss dielectric materials, relatively large samples are needed to measure the change in the Q-factor accurately.  Therefore, a full-wave numerical technique must be used to model the cavity problem.  The persent proposal will conduct a thorough study of three rigorous techniques:  the integral equation technique, the finite element method, and the finite element method, and the finite difference time domain method, as applied to the problem at hand.  A novel inversion algorithm for the solution of the associated inverse problem will be implemented.  The numerical tehniques will be compared, and the code that provides the highest accuracy, while computationally efficient, will be selected for the estimation of the dielectric constant using the cavity method.  The accuracy of the numerical code will be verified using experimental data collected from various low-loss dielectric samples.",

        "abstract": "Recombinant cytokines could be used to augment immune responses during periods of bird production such as the embryonic/early posthatch stage when birds are most susceptible to disease.  However, only seven avian cytokines have been cloned and no recombinant avian cytokines are presently available in sufficient quantities for testing in the prevention and therapy of poultry diseases.  Cytokines from other species have limited or no activity in avians.  Attempts to clone the avian cytokine cDNA's for Interleukin-2 and interferon-y based on the known sequences of mammalian cytokines have been remarkably unsuccessful suggesting that the avian homologs have little sequence homology to their mammalian counterparts.  Therefore, a cloning strategy employing primers/probes based on the amino acid sequences of purified natural cytokines appears to be necessary.  The purification of naturally produced avian cytokines from cell conditioned media sources for the purpose of generating amino acid sequence data and/or antibodies is described in this Phase I proposal.  EMBREX is unique in having available in the form of its immunomodulator product ample quantities of cytokine containing cell conditioned media derived from Con A stimulated chicken spleocytes as source material for further cytokine purification.  Reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) will be used as the primary step to fractionate cytokine activities.  Cytokines will be purified from RP-HPLC fractions by additional chromotography steps monitored by a combination of protein determinations, bioassays and SDS-PAGE.",

        "abstract": "Electrical points-of-entry (POE) are one of the critical elements which comprise the shielded topology for C4I facilities.  The quality of these POEs is critical for the maintenance of low-risk HEMP hardening.  Of the POE treatments discussed in MIL-STD-188-125 and MIL-HDBK-423, power and communication/signal-line filters pose a distinct problem.  The insertion loss of communication/signal-line filters also are measured per MIL-STD-220 under source- and load-impedances of 50 ohms.  The insertion loss of communication/signal-line filters also are measured per MIL-STD-220, except that the measurement is made with a load impedance equal to the image impedance of the filter.  In both cases, it is highly unlikely that the filters will have the same insertion loss when they are installed in the C4I facility as the source- and load-impedances seen by the filter will vary widely from 50 ohms and will, most likely, have reactive components.  In the worst-case scenario, a filter determined to be compliant after it is tested per MIL-STD-220 may amplify the external stress, thereby degrading the hardness of the facility.  Insertion loss with respect to transients is not addressed at the Q/A level.  The Phase I technical objective is to extend the coherent-measurement technique to transient excitations by measuring the scattering parameters of the filter under test during the temporal excitation.  Power- and signal-line filters also are used in the private sector.  The measurement techniques developed in the proposed research effort  can easily be adapted by private-sector concerns, particularly the commercial airline industry where filter design is weight/performance critical.  Although non-DoD entities do not worry about HEMP stresses on electronics, they are concerned with transient stresses including lightning, ESD, and switching noise.",

        "abstract": "The wide band-gap semiconductors SiC and III-V nitrides have been receiving greatly increased attention for high temperature and high power semiconductor devices, and for light emitting devices and laser applications at blue and UV wavelengths. Currently, one of the major hurdles in the development of these technologies is the substrate technology: (a) for SiC, substrates are extremely expensive and available only in small diameter sizes; (b) for the 111-N there is a complete lack of suitable single crystal substrate material which is lattice-matched. Epitaxy on substitute substrates usually results in films with high dislocation density. The SiC SOI structure, which has a very thin film of crystalline cubic 3C-SiC (50 - 1000A) on an insulator layer (SiO2) is a potential candidate for a low cost, large area, high quality compliant substrate. This approach could reduce the dislocation density in the grown films by force the threading dislocations downward towards the compliant oxide layer. In addition, the lattice mismatch for subsequent growth of SiC is eliminated and for GaN is greatly reduced (I%). Combining the formation of the SiC SOI structure and III-V nitride growth by MOCVD technology, a new and effective compliant substrate technology can be developed for these important materials.",

We hypothesize that the main reason for lack of success is a consequence of chestnut being a ring porous tree whose anatomy and physiology naturally \"wall off\" the cultured shoots from the medium, hindering transport of water and solutes to the growning points.

This process uses a regenerable adsorbent in asimple thermal cycle with no additives or waste materials.  Experimental studiesshow that NOx can be reversibly adsorbed on certain inorganic compounds.  NOx isdesorbed when the temperature of these compounds is increased.  In laboratorytests, one material reduced several hundred ppm of NOx down to less than 2 ppm.It is anticipated that full-scale commercial application of this technology couldprovide 95% NOx reduction.Past studies performed by EER have verified the ability of various sorbents toeffectively and reversibly adsorb NOx.  The NOx adsorption capacity of severalsorbents has been studied, and a kinetic model predicting sorbent behavior undervarious temperature/partial pressure conditions has been developed.  Phase I ofthe proposed project will address additional technical questions needed todetermine feasibility for gas turbine applications.  Most importantly, thisincludes evaluating the impact of thermal cycling and high oxygen concentrationson sorbent performance.  The adsorption/desorption process requires alternatingstreams of various temperature gases.

        "abstract": "Proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells provide significant advantages over conventional power systems.  They operate at very high efficiencies (greater than 50% direct conversion and at system efficiencies which can exceed 40%), generate no emissions, are responsive to rapid start up and load changes, and operate near ambient temperature and pressure.  Units have been developed for and applied to a variety of vehicle and stationary applications. PEM fuel cells, however, have achieved limited success due to their size and weight.  This proposed program will develop a light weight, efficient and cost effective fuel cell by using alternatives to conventional compressed, planar PEM fuel cell geometry.  Present PEM fuel cells rely on a planar electrode and bi-polar collector plate design.  In order to work efficiently, the cells operate above ambient pressure.  This requires that the cell assembly have the structural strength to withstand operation at pressure.  The designs proposed in this program utilize radically new geometrical configurations to remove the need for operation at high pressure (greater than 10 psi).  Structures under consideration include cylindrical and monopolar, planar designs. Benefits of the new designs are removal of the need for heavy assembly and compression hardware and reduction of the material requirements for the internal cell structure.",

The erosion data will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-erosion treatments and of hydrogen fuels that have hydrocarbon additives.  The lifetime of high temperature carbon components will be estimated.  Receiver designs will be drafted to exploit the power conversion applications.

A high- resolution mine-detection technique will allow individual mines to be targeted, with a consequent enormous saving of resources.  Most imaging techniques produce blurred images with only a few pixels per mine, in which the mines are nearly indistinguishable from their surroundings.  The nonlinear edge-sharpening method proposed here, based on the second-order Godunov technique employed in computational fluid dynamics, will significantly improve mine-detection capabilities.  The method effectively mitigates instrumental errors, channel noise, and the low-amplitude high-frequency noise component introduced by the imaging technique.  It is a hands-off technique that produces qualitative improvement even without image-specific pre- or postprocessing.  This is especially valuable for rapid surveillance methods.  We propose to develop an optimized PC-based menu-driven package which will permit images to be enhanced in real time.  The same techniques can also be exploited in other fields of commercial importance, such as medical science: essentially every CAT scan and MRI facility is a potential customer.",

Modern methods of intensive forest management in southern pine standards (pure, even-aged, dense stands) have created maturing stands where SPB populations are, with increasing frequency, escaping the moderating forces of their natural enemies.

        "abstract": "In Situ bioremediation systems, such as bioventing, have been applied at numerous sites to remediate petroleum hydrocarbons and other common organic contaminants.  Monitoring the progress of biodegradation for in situ systems has been problematic.  One monitoring method examined at a limited number of sites utilizes stable carbon isotope analysis.  Through the use of stable carbon isotopes, the relative amount of carbon dioxide contributed from the biodegradation of organic contaminants can be determined.  This source determination for carbon dioxide can be used to verify biological degradation at active bioremediation and bio-attenuation sites.  The benefits of the stable isotope method include:  lower costs per sample, lower time required per sample and fewer samples require per site.  The goal of this proposal is to further the development of the stable carbon isotope monitoring method. Currently, the major impediment to application of the method is the limited amount of data available regarding fractionation of carbon isotopes by biological systems during the aerobic degradation of xenobiotic compounds.  For the method to be effectively applied fractionation of the carbon isotopes must be determined for a variety of compounds undergoing biodegradation, with varying microbial inoculum responsible for the carbon dioxide production. The effects of various bacterial oxygenase systems will also be assessed, as well as the effects of fractionation on the carbon isotope composition of end products (i.e. carbon dioxide) resulting from the biodegradation of mixtures of compounds.",

The wind sensor technology we are developing has several advantages over heterodyne detection lidars, including simplicity, eye-safety, range resolution, and cost.  When integrated into a hybrid system with RF and MMW radars, a comprehensive, all-weather, reliable, and accurate system will result.  In Phase I, we will systematically define a set of requirements for the Army's Lidar Wind Field Sensor, perform system analyses to ensure that our proposed baseline meets these requirements, perform system trades including MMW hybrid assessments, build and test critical lidar components in a laboratory breadboard, and design a baseline autonomous lidar wind sensor to be implemented in Phase II.",

There have been problems -- until now -- using these phenomena for detailed assessment of machinery like high-performance aircraft gearboxes. An artificial \"noise floor\" and the sensor limitations of accelerometer technologies have caused this. Epoch Engineering, Inc. (EEI) has developed and has demonstrated a unique acoustic detection ability. Our Robust Laser Interferometer is able to detect and display frequencies from below 1 Hz to 100 KHz at amplitude differences up to 11 orders of magnitude (110 dB). The unique capability, when compared to customary accelerometer field implementations, allows measurements not previously practical (effectively dropping the noise floor in spite of the presence of high amplitude vibrations). This process allows us to interrogate the outside of such a machine as a gearbox and detect signals originating inside. It can \"baseline\" a gearbox on the test stand and then monitor its performance on wing and serve as the fundamental sensing technology for automated systems of machinery monitoring.",

However, to be implemented widely and effectively, expert systems need to be developed in a cost effective manner and integrated within existing programs through the user interfaces currently in place.  Current expert system tools lack a generic approach to integration of developed applications into existing programs.  Applications which have been tightly integrated have typically used a highly customized approach that both made the development of the expert system logic costly and resulted in such customized code that it could not be easily applied to other applications.  This proposal is to create an expert system delivery environment that will allow applications, developed using easy to learn shells, to be integrated in a GUI-independent manner within a wise range of user interfaces and on a wide range of platforms.

Current state-of-the-art metal plating relies on baths containingproprietary additive.  These additives were developed empirically and consist ofbrighteners, levelers, and surfactants.  These additives affect the platingprocess to yield electrodeposits with the appropriate properties for their givenapplications.  During plating, these additives gradually decompose and arereplenished until the bath can no longer be used due to the build up ofdecomposition products.  Consequently, the rinse waters cannot be recycled toplating operations.  In addition, since the additives and their decompositionproducts build up and adversely effect the rinse operations, the rinse waterscannot be recycled to the rinse operations.  Finally, the sensitivity of theelectrodeposition process to the concentration of additives makes it difficultto maintain control of the plating process.  They propose to replace the additiveplating bath chemistries with electrodeposition from additive-free electrolytesusing pulse current waveforms.  Additive-free electrolytes will allow therecovery and in-process recycle of rinse waters and plating baths enablingclosed-loop environmentally conscious metal plating.",

FASTMAN has developed FASTWAVE, a wavelet-based compression technology which produces high quality compression of many different types of data.  We have also developed a low-power chip set to implement FASTWAVE.  Because FASTWAVE is based on wavelets, its bitstreams can readily be integrated into the CEC's encryption scheme. Our objective in this project is to determine the feasibility of using FASTWAVE to provide the Navy with a compression technology within the CEC to compress multiple types of sensor data.

        "abstract": "A novel approach to measuring human performance under high angular acceleration (especially, but not limited to centrifuge research) is developed in this Phase I proposal.  The approach begins with intensive interaction between the operational user community and the performance-test developers to define \"boundary\" or criterion performances which answer the question \"Can a given mission be achieved under expected G-loadings?\"  These boundary performances are then decomposed into part-tasks, and high construct-validity simulations of these are designed (avoiding academically pure but construct-limited synthetic tasks).  These simulations provide traditional metrics (reaction time, percent correct, etc.), but are directly related to critical elements of operational tasks.  In a second stage of the effort, data such as those which would be collected in actual experiments are used in mission effectiveness computer models to answer the question \"How well can this mission's tasks be performed under the expected G-loadings?\"  These models permit the laboratory data to be generalized to any type of mission, and result in output data phrased in terms of probable mission impact of various flight profiles, tactics, or protective devices in the acceleration environment.  Phase I will produce a completely specified performance assessment strategy for centrifuge research, engineering designs for the system, and demonstration of both the performance assessment and mission effectiveness modeling approaches.",

For optimum performance, field emitter displays require current limiters to ensure uniformity of luminosity, eliminate emitter failure, protect against shorting defects, and help control overpowering of the phosphor screen.  This proposal addresses the development of a unique current limiter structure which has the potential to greatly improve performance of low-cost field emitter-based video displays.  In combination with our nanolithography technology for patterning ultra-small, dense emitters, the new current limiter will enable uniform, reliable operation in the 5V control voltage range.  Low voltage turn-on facilitates use of very low cost display electronics, as well as enabling lower cost processing of the displays themselves.  In this Phase I project we will build and test experimental current limiter devices optimized for 0.15 micron emitters.  The device characteristics will be analyzed to determine the best performance devices to be used in a Phase II high performance flat-panel video display design.",

Electroabsorption modulator, on the other hand, has been demonstrated to provide 120 dB/Hz2/3 dynamic range in a non- optimized link. In this proposal we intend to optimize the modulator as well as the wide band detector to achieve 140 dB link dynamic range without sacrificing its microwave bandwidth capability.  Approaches to achieve the improvement will be through device design to increase the optical power handling capacity and coupling efficiency to single mode fiber.

The delay line will consist of fifteen 2x2 optical switches connected by single mode fiber sections of unequal length.  A key component in the system is the all-fiber piezoelectrically actuated switch developed at Texas A&M University and transferred to FFPI Industries for commercialization.  Other components include a distributed feedback laser diode, an electrooptic modulator, Er:fiber amplifiers, a photodetector, and a microwave amplifier. Goals of the Phase I project are: (1) develop a cost-effective design for a system meeting the Army's requirements, (2) provide specifications for the system components, (3) identify potential component suppliers, (4) model system performance, (5) conduct laboratory tests on all-fiber switches, and (6) document the Phase I results.  An option task to develop a prototype of an all-fiber switch for use in the Phase II project is also proposed.",

        "abstract": "This program will demonstrate the fabrication of ultra lightweight/high performance composite annular electrodes incorporating the reliability, via strength and toughness, necessary to facilitate efficient, simple assembly of low cost PEM fuel cells for lightweight extended duty cycle portable power sources.  New and innovative composite manufacturing techniques will be employed which offer a low cost, net shape automated fabrication process. The design concept incorporates methods to affect more efficient electrocatalyst reactions through enhanced electrolyte/catalyst/electrode interface and reactant dispersion. Techniques will be demonstrated to optimize the electrode electrical/thermal conductivity properties and provide a highly reliable method of structurally encapsulating the PEM and achieving optimal water management.  These techniques provide mechanical mechanisms which maintain the integrity/stability of the reaction region interface and insure that thermal fatigue, vibration and shock loadings do not decouple the constituent materials/ components.  A lightweight multidirectional pitch carbon fiber reinforced composite electrode will be fabricated which incorporates a controlled porosity to affect optimal gaseous reactant and reaction product flow.  This electrode will function as the primary structural component of the fuel cell system by accommodating internal/external loading, contain high pressure forced reactant flow and perform indefinitely in a hydrated environment.",

        "abstract": "Underground pipelines and distribution systems are routinely monitored for leakage.  The methods used can find large, longterm leaks but are unable to quickly locate leaks in complex systems. Pipeline leaks are particularly harmful in permeable substrates due to rapid spreading of the spill.  In the past ten years, advancements have been made in spectroscopic methods and fiber optic techniques which have the potential for making direct in-situ monitoring of underground systems a practical and cost effective reality.  The proposed fiber optic chemical sensors (FOCS) does not utilize a sensitized coating for interaction with the leaking liquid and the required signal processing subsystems and sensors are relatively inexpensive vs. other fiber optic systems.  High sensitivity and specific chemical species selectivity of this system would permit the development of a retrofit sensors for leak detection.  Under the proposed program, FOCAS (Fiber Optics for Comminications and Sensors, Ltd.) will demonstrate the technical feasibility of using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopic methods and a near-IR evanescent wave FOCS to perform in-situ leak monitoring of hydrocarbon fuels in a simulated underground installation environment.  Integration of the sensor with currently available instrumentation makes the transistion of this technology into the commercial environment technicall and financially feasible.",

To determine feasibility, tests will be conducted during Phase I using components of a system recently developed for shipping high densities of live fish.  This system will be modified to conform to brood shrimp dimensions, physiology and behavior.  \n\nPhase I work will have the following objectives:  (1) to determine if this live fish transport is a practical alternative to the standard shipping method of brood shrimp, (2) to determine if redesigning this transport system will improve it's performance with brood shrimp, and (3) to compare efficiency in economic terms by calculating benefit-cost ratios for the two shipping methods.",

In a resistive bolometer, absorbed infrared energy produces a temperature change in a thermally isolated thermal detector.  A high temperature coefficient of resistance bolometers using deposited films of vanadium oxide achieve a moderate TCR of 2%/degrees C.  We propose to use thermally isolated amorphous silicon as the microbolometer LWIR thermal detector capitalizing on its high temperature coefficient in excess of 12%/degrees C.  In addition, a UFPA based upon an all silicon integrated circuit process can be fabricated at commercial silicon integrated circuit foundries.  Integrated circuit micro-machining processes will be used to produce a low thermal mass island of amorphous silicon on a self supporting bridge which provides thermal isolation.  The resultant all silicon UFPA formed by this process offers the potential to construct thermal imaging systems of high cosmetic quality, higher performance and lower cost than existing hybrid pyroelectric and monolithic bolometric FPA approaches.",

Foster-Miller has demonstrated that closed cell foams with densities as low as 10% of the unfoamed polymer can be easily fabricated with this technology. The dielectric constant of a polymer such as a polyimide can be reduced from about 3.5 to a value as low as 1.25 with concomitant reductions in dielectric loss and mass density. Compared to other approaches which result in open cell structures, the closed cell foam minimizes entrapment of solvents and other chemicals used in the processing. In Phase I, Foster Miller will work with its commercialization partner, Axiomatics, Inc. to fabricate a polymer with good mechanical properties and a dielectric constant below 2.0 using the microcellular foam technology. The dielectric properties will be characterized from dc to 40 GHz. Techniques to convert the foamed polymer into useful product such as multilayer printed wiring boards, multichip modules and PCMCIA cards will be developed. In Phase II, we will fabricate and test prototype units and scale up the foaming process to produce continuous rolls of film. Most high speed and high density electronic systems will benefit from this development. Availability of a light weight polymer with a lower dielectric constant and better mechanical properties than Teflon will revolutionize the electronic packaging industry. Portable personal communication and computing devices, and avionics and space electronic systems will be the primary beneficiaries of this development.",

        "abstract": "Elastomeric rendering systems have become the state-of-the-art in dockside fenders within the last two decades.  These fenders have a variety of shapes and designs and predominately use modified rubbers.  These fenders are generally reliable.  However, two factors serve to limit their potential.  They are frequently designed based on rules of thumb and will work most efficiently for a certain class of ship.  Also, the modified rubber materials will experience property degradation over time due to the effects of temperature, oxygen, sunlight and ozone attack.  Therefore the effectiveness over time is at issue.  A poorly functioning dock fender can cause expensive damage to both docks and ships. Foster-Miller proposes to develop advanced elastomeric composite fenders that combine both highly damage tolerant, energy absorbing elastomeric composite materials (such as developed by the Navy) and unique fender designs that optimize the energy absorbing characteristics of these fenders.  The Phase I program will include techniques to incorporate \"smart\" fenders (i.e., fenders whose compliance varies as a function of impact energy) that minimize damage to both docks and ships.  The nation's largest developer of elastomeric fenders, Trellex Morse, and one of the Navy's principal shipbuilders, Bath Iron Works, are team members in the Phase I program.",

        "abstract": "Avionics systems repairs are responsible for as much as 42% of the life cycle cost of an aircraft, making it important to minimize avionic suite cost while maintaining performance.  Currently, there is no unified method of determining the trade-offs between avionics suite performance and life cycle cost.  The best approach to a unified solution is to let mission requirements define the avionics systems.  Once the system is designed the power level is used to correlate electronic packaging and cooling systems.  There is a considerable amount of information available in the literature and data bases on failure mechanisms, costs, and cooling for electronic packages.  The relationships between variables in this system are known but tend to be non-linear, discontinuous, and contain step functions that make analysis using conventional techniques difficult.  A computer program is needed that will handle the large complicated domain this problem presents and calculate the relatively simple range (Life Cycle Cost).  The optimum computer algorithm to handle this problem is genetic. With genetic algorithms a generic code will be established that will handle all possibilities of electronic package technology, cooling technology, airframe constraints and repair scenarios.  The results will enable users to identify all suitable combinations of technology and assess risk.",

        "abstract": "The increased use of composite materials on both military and commercial aircraft must be accompanied by a more efficient means of in-service repair techniques. Composite fuselage, wing and engine components are subjected to Foreign Object Debris (FOD) which can result in many types of repairable damage. Current repair techniques can be expensive and fail to restore complete structural integrity of the component. Foster-Miller proposes new repair technology to reduce costs and enhance the structural performance of composite repairs. The proposed process utilizes a proprietary process developed by Foster-Miller, Z-fiber reinforcement. This proven process can be adapted to reinforce cured composite structures through the thickness to prevent growth of delaminations without the need for removal of the damaged material. When severe damage is encountered, this process can serve to mechanically fasten composite patches and provide a smooth aerodynamic surface. Phase I will demonstrate the feasibility of this process to repair complex shaped structures such as engine blades and vanes. Three common types of damage are to be addressed in this program: internal delaminations, edge delaminations, and material losses. General Electric Aircraft Engines is our partner in the Phase I effort to insure approaches developed are relevant to future aircraft engine components. This proposed process is of particular interest to GEAE for repair of CF6-80CZ guide vanes and GE90 fan blades.",

Currently available \"green\" chemical strippers are much less effective, requiring long application periods and multiple applications. Foster-Miller proposes the development of a robust, enzyme-activated paint removal system that will actively degrade polyurethane-based coatings in an environmentally acceptable manner within a few hours of application.  An environmentally benign and biodegradable solvent is first applied to the coating to soften and swell the coating prior to application of the enzyme.  The enzyme or a consortia of enzymes are encapsulated and stored in a biodegradable gel, released upon exposure of the gel to the solvent, and degrade the polyurethane coating.  The gels provide a formulation that is easy and safe to apply by normally skilled military personnel.  The Phase I program focuses on the (a) identification, characterization and selection of both the solvent(s) and enzyme(s) and (b) identification and characterization of biodegradable polymeric gels with respect to the encapsulation and release of model enzymes.

This Phase I proposes to develop the technology required to resolve the strain distribution as a function of length along the sensor so that non uniform strain distributions and stress wave propagation during ballistic impact can be measured.

Our approach combines three enabling technologies to produce this innovative, low-cost RTC/RTM composite.  These enabling technologies include hydrocarbon reactive resins, peroxide accelerator/promoter chemistry and RTM or FW processing.  During RTM, low viscosity RTC/RTM resin will fill the mold quickly at low pressures.  The specially catalyzed/promoted resin will initiate cure within the mold at room temperature, producing a hard, rigid, composite structure that meets the requirements at 10% lower density than epoxy composites.

Leaching of corrosion inhibiting from the coating upon exposure to the ambient environment or fluids will be reduced as well as worker exposure to the cations due to encapsulating of the inhibitors in a gel which becomes securely imbedded in the coating.

In Phase I, we will develop biopolymer metal combinations, establish injection molding parameters, injection mold approximately 50 non-toxic, environmentally degradable projectile and prepare a final report which includes a scale-up plan for commercialization of the technology.  In Phase II, will refine the process and produce quantities of projectiles for ballistic testing and evaluation. Our commercialization effort will begin in Phase I, with design input from a curren cartridge manufacturing company and in Phase II, transition the technology to the cartridge manufacture for production.  By combining Foster-Miller's biodegradable polymer expertise with our teaming partners production capabilities/knowledge, we will readily succeed in producing environmentally safe ammunition that can be used by the military and commercial sectors.",

        "abstract": "We offer an approach to a multiple-order-of-magnitude processing speed/efficiency improvement in vector quantization (VQ) data/image compression, automatic target recognition/classification, and time signal/signature classification. We base our approach on an algorithmic breakthrough, the TABULAR NEAREST-NEIGHBOR ENCODER (TNE), which we discovered and partially developed last year. This algorithm reduces the computational complexity associated with such problems from 1 to over 4 orders-of magnitude compared to other techniques. A significant property is the relative insensitivity of the algorithm's complexity to codebook and/or vector partition size. This property renders feasible the use of very large image quantization or feature vector codebooks in real-time with relatively modest processor hardware. Larger codebooks will render practicable larger vector partitionings and thence greater data compression ratios than were previously associated with VQ methods. The TNE architecture is well suited for parallel processing and for independent sub-space (i.e., correlated partial image block) classifications. This latter property will greatly facilitate model-based classification of partially obscured target imagery and partially masked time signatures. This effort will significantly advance the state-of-the-art in real-time image/data compression; in automatic recognition/classification of exposed and/or partially obscured targets; and in related commercial applications (multimedia, video compression, speech recognition/compression/synthesis, etc.)",

Nutrients, especially nitrogen, and energy contained in wastes from agricultural products need to be returned to farming operations to improve sustainability.  Policies which promote recycling of municipal solid waste streams are creating new market opportunities for alternative utilization of wastes to meet mandated recycling goals.  Many states are restricting the disposal of degradable wastes in landfills.  The alternatives for disposition of source separated food wastes are re-feeding and composting.  Since this waste is putrescible, re-feeding is not normally feasible.  Food waste has such a high moisture content (>80%) that aerobic composting requires extensive use of bulking agents and aeration efforts to reduce odor and ensure an adequate oxygen supply.  Also aerobic composting results in loss of nitrogen (>50%).  This project will explore the feasibility of using percolating-bed anaerobic composting (PBAC) technology to process source separated food waste into a liquid fertilizer, a soil amendment and a fuel source.",

        "abstract": "Currently, a 300 watt fuel cell stack of bipolar design projects a power density of about 40 watts per kilogram of system, excluding fuel and fuel tankage.  In contrast, a battery of identically performing fuel cells which uses the concept of a single sheet of electrolyte shared by all cells, can achieve about 250 watts per kilogram, a factor of six improved.  The single sheet design is so much lighter because it does not require end-plates, cell frames and cell supports for proper sealing, electrical contact, and fluid porting.  Using the single sheet fuel cell concept, a 300 watt fuel cell system with chemical hydride is projected to weigh 4.3 kg, well within the 5 kg goal set by the customer.  This is a significant weight savings over a traditional bipolar stack at about 10.6 kg.  The issue of Power to Weight Ratio has been rightfully prioritized as the vital driver for successful man-portable power supplies. Our past experience with smaller systems based on the proposed concept, teaches that success is based on the satisfactory resolution of design issues inter-relating more intricately than in bipolar stacks.  We propose in Phase I to perform the necessary design studies of cell, stack, and system in which the issues of configuration, operating envelope, and robustness are addressed and solved to a confidence level warranting hardware development in Phase II.",

Therefore, many critical and high performance automated processes are still supervised by human; as the consequences of their unexpected failure can be dramatic to both man and machines. We propose the pattern theory as a systematic paradigm for the automatic programming and extraction of diagnostic logic from process data.  The proposed approach combined elements of the model-based process analysis techniques with the learning aspect of the pattern theoretic paradigm in order to extract diagnostic knowledge from fault scenarios and their symptoms.  The performance of the pattern-finding algorithms in solving three benchmark problems is evaluated in the Phase I.  Our team's experience in integrating computational learning schemes to industrial applications and our background in, and contributions to, the state-of-the-art in process control and identification enhance our chance of resolving many of the multidisciplinary issues of the proposed approach.",

A safe fire fighting simulation and training system would help fire fighters to better survive this hostile environment.  The Phase I project will define the external sensory factors that must be reinforced to create a realistic fire fighting simulation. Actual fire fighter experienced sensory data will be obtained by using electronic/mechanical measuring devices.  The sensory data to be gathered will include heat, humidity, and sounds experienced by fire fighters while wearing a \"bunker suit\".  Human factors involved with wearing a bunker suit will also be collected.  The collected data will be analyzed to determine which senses should be stimulated to what degree during an immersive virtual environment fire fighting simulation.

        "abstract": "Use of very high strength cold work or age hardened metallic materials for advanced rocket components, and preliminary low temperature joining experiments to show feasibility are proposed. The proposed approach to rocket component manufacturing should assure optimum material properties, most importantly highest strengths, in advanced rocket structures thus leading to significantly lighter components.  High temperature joining methods such as brazing, welding, and diffusion bonding reduce strengths by causing recrystallization or over-aging of alloys frequently used in the manufacture of advanced rockets.  Because of lowered strength, section thicknesses in structural components are frequently increased leading to higher component weights.  The proposed improvement in the dry-weight of rockets would most likely be between 20 and 50%. The proposed fabrication methods relies on low temperatures joining and shaping processes to preserve high strength of materials used.  In Phase I, low temperature bonding processes will be developed for joining of two typical rocket engine materials.  An assessment of the potential weight savings possible for a typical advanced rocket will also be made.  In Phase demonstrate weight savings under service-like loading.",

        "abstract": "A Forward-looking synthetic aperture sonar is proposed for detecting mines ahead of an amphibious vehicle in the very shallow water/surf zone. The sonar provides unique high resolution range-elevation images for detecting and locating moored, bottom resting, and buried mines. Fine elevation resolution, obtained synthetically, defines the water/bottom boundary and hence provides a strong discriminant against buried objects. Underwater mines are resolved into several pixels in range and elevation for ease of detection. The system will also have a useful azimuthal resolution to enable avoiding mines and other obstacles. The system produces the images at normal vehicle speeds. High resolution and high speed are both possible due to an innovative multi-beam bistatic configuration. High quality synthetic aperture imaging is possible in the presence of severe motion irregularities because of a reliable, high accuracy, computationally efficient autofocus technique developed by GORCA. Recently, GORCA collected and successfully imaged initial experimental synthetic aperture shallow water data, in the presence of severe motion irregularities, using an internally developed single-beam high resolution sonar. In Phase I, the existing system will be used to collect and process data containing representative test targets, and a multi-beam prototype will be designed.",

For convenience, we have chosen Si on insulator (SOI) material for optical and electrical characterization. Our nanofabrication approach  relies on simple laser interferometric lithography techniques that are uniquely adaptable to large area manufacturing.  Suitable application of wet-chemical etching and steam  oxidation of Si have been used to form free-standing Si wires.  SEM, Raman, PL, and electrical measurements are used to characterize Si wires as a function of their linewidth. Raman scattering shows large enhancement for 50-100 nm linewidths, and a splitting of the bulk mode for estimated 10-nm linewidths. Room temperature PL measurements from 10-nm structures show peaks varying from 530-630 nm. Electrical measurements in MSM configuration show significantly enhanced current response. A systematic investigation of these nm wire structures is proposed to determine PL correlation with crystal-size, and device performance in MSM and pn-junction configurations. Commercial applications include: 1. Si light sources for display applications, optical interconnects, 2. Si field-emission devices, 3. nm-linewidth Si devices, and 4. Si grating solar cells.",

        "abstract": "The development of manufacturing techniques necessary to produce a new type of optical filter is proposed. The filter is made by coating a transparent substrate with optical films in such a manner as to produce broadband interference effects. The optical thickness of each film layer of the coating exceeds the coherence length of sunlight and many artificial sources, but not the coherence length of most laser sources, resulting in a thick-film filter that discriminates between coherent and incoherent light over broad wavelength ranges. Rudimentary calculations show that by using this type of filter, a contrast ratio in excess of 1000 between coherent and incoherent light is possible using readily available materials. The objectives of this proposal are to develop the technology necessary to fabricate such a filter and to test the fabricated filter under a variety of circumstances. The immediate benefit to BMDO is seen in the area of protection of sensors from laser attack. Other benefits to having a coherence filter include: the operation of a laser-based communication system in direct sunlight and protection from laser radiation for any type of optical sensor, including the human eye. In addition to the military applications, these filters have enormous potential for the civilian markets in the area of laser safety and laser communications.",

The technique will be based on a seminal discovery in multivariate regression analysis that promises to yield dramatic increases in failure forecasting accuracy. Failure probabilities, rather than being estimated on the basis of one or two basic variables, such as the total number of flight hours, will be estimated on the basis of the entire life histories of items, including electrical, mechanical, and thermal stress.This will be made possible by sets of matrix equations that will analyze all the life histories simultaneously regardless of the complexity or multicollinearity of the data. The forecasting computer model and the life histories of the equipment on an aircraft will be carried aboard the aircraft on floppy disks for use every time maintenance is performed. Base and intermediate level maintenance personnel will be able to identify items that should be replaced or repaired before the next flight. The results are expected to include longer average equipment lifetime, longer periods between preventive maintenance actions, and fewer failures.",

More than twenty states and HMOs have initiated telemedicine projects for rural areas; their success is limited because they rely on expensive technology, point-to-point transmission, high-speed data lines and high-bandwidth telecommunications infrastructure which are not available in many rural areas.  The research project assesses feasibility of using new technological opportunities (K-Band Satellite, Borad-Band Technology) to develop processes and products for low to moderate cost image transmission which make best use of existing infrastructure in rural areas; produce cost-effective telemedicine technology and improved health care delivery to rural populations; and create jobs and new industries for rural areas.  Project team has exemplary track record in developing and marketing innovative medical systems software and hardware; health care delivery in isolated rural areas; successful rural community and economic development.

To meet this goal, we propose to produce, high purity, unagglomerated, engineered, nanocrystalline tungsten and titanium particlates in situ in the ration of around 10:1 as a model material, by incorporating a low-cost method called Gas Phase Combustion Synthesis (GCS) and consolidate the fine particulates to full density by Hot Pressing to replace the environmentally sensitive Depleted Uranium.  Our W/Ti synthesis route involves a sodium-flame process together with a NaCl coating technique that prevents agglomeration.  The byproduct-coating of individual tungsten grains and reduce tungsten to tungsten contiguity.  Hot Pressing of the W/Ti particles will be conducted at lower temperatures and higher pressures to curtail the growth of tungsten grains.  The resulting material via nanoscale technology, will have a microstructure containing nanocrystalline tungsten grains uniformly dispersed in titanium matrix (binder phase).  The resulting microstructure will be unique and is expected to provide increased strength and fracture toughness and therefore, shear localization at reduced strain levels.  The GCS process is equally applicable for synthesis of a variety of  metals and composites. The process is attractive because scale-up is straightforward.  In addition to synthesis and consolidation of 90W-10Ti, we propose to demonstrate the occurrence of shear localization in nanocrystalline 90%W-10%Ti by compression testing at strain-rate ~5000 s(-1) in order to simulate ballistic test conditions and enhance the usefulness of this material in defense and commercial sectors.",

        "abstract": "In today's congested electromagnetic environment, broadband receivers for electronic support measures (ESM) are susceptible to interference by both friendly and hostile emitters. To avoid receiver performance degradation due to interference, narrow-band notch filters are often used to suppress interfering signals. Conventional notch filters that rely on the magnetic tuning (i.e. ferrite and YIG devices) are bulky, which makes them unsuitable for use in limited space, such as in periscope-mounted ESM receivers. Hittite Microwave Corporation has developed novel filtering techniques using active devices built in microwave monolithic integrated circuits (MMIC). Hittite has demonstrated tunable notch filters operating in X-band frequencies, built in a gallium-arsenide (GaAs) chip of 1.5 mm x 3 mm dimensions. Hittite's MMIC filters operate with a companion MMIC chip designed to control filter characteristics, and maintain optimum filter performance. This combination of two chips may be used for active and adaptive suppression of interfering signals. In addition, Hittite demonstrated MMIC chips for sampled-data filtering at VHF/UHF frequencies based on the switched-capacitance technique. The GaAs technology also allows extension of low-frequency interference suppression techniques to microwave frequencies. This proposal describes Hittite's approach to suppress interference and provide CW immunity to broadband ESM receivers by using MMIC filtering techniques. The MMIC filter chips can be accommodated in the limited space available in the front-end of submarine ESM receivers. The proposed program will lead to definition of optimum combination of filter techniques for seamless coverage of the receiver band and preliminary design and analyses of filter performance, in preparation for hardware implementation and demonstration in Phase 2.",

For submarine ESM systems, MMIC techniques may be applied to integrate critical front-end functions with the antenna assembly to be accommodated within the limited space available on the periscope.  To take advantage of the full potential of size reduction offered by MMIC, it is imperative to develop MMIC techniques for high-scale integration.  To that end, Hittite Microwave Corporation has developed novel MMIC for filters, mixers, phase-locked oscillators, etc.  This proposal describes Hittite's approach to miniaturize ESM receivers using highly integrated MMIC chips.  Advanced MMIC techniques and high-scale integration experience, unique to Hittite, are presented as bases for the next level of integration of ESM receivers.  As an example, a design approach for a miniaturized scanning superheterodyne receiver is presented.  In Phase I of the proposed program, a specific receiver configuration will be selected for miniatruization, and MMIC requirements for such receiver design will be defined.

Fixed wavelength solutions have advanced to the point where military eyewear with multiple protection (seven wavelength protection) is being implemented. Agile solutions are less developed, a major obstacle being the difficulty in obtaining the concurrent characteristics of safety blockage (required filter performance), very fast response times (less than nanoseconds) and implementability on current military eyewear.  A novel approach is proposed in which a hybrid technology capitalizes on the advances already achieved with fixed wavelength filters and the fast response of optical switching.  A fixed wavelength holographic filter is made tunable by doping it with materials which can vary the volumetric and/or index of refraction characteristics of the material.  A composite holographic filter reduces the material variation requirements to less than 1%, thus facilitating optical switching.  The result will be a tunable filter with a filter performance meeting military specifications and the fast response time required of an agile filter. Additionally, the filter architecture will be compatible with military eyewear.",

Those cultural, traditional and religious values are being threatened; as huckleberry plants are eliminated from their natural environment through loss of space, water, nutrients, and sunlight, part of the culture and traditions of the tribal community will die with it.\n\nFor many Oregonians and tribal people, this is also a family loss as an economic resource and for recreational family activities.  Governmental forest management eliminated the traditional burning methods of huckleberry  management and promoted commercial timber at the expense of native food resources.  This project will develop an opportunity for tribal people to be a part of the traditional ways within today's technology; and to regain community pride and employment through co-management for multiple-use of the forested areas.  The objectives are (1) to reduce competitive vegetation thereby increasing availability of sunlight, soil moisture and nutrients to the huckleberry plants while providing ground cover to protect the soil; (2) to restock plants, as needed; (3) to develop employment and training programs to form a pool of skilled workers or contractors.",

        "abstract": "The current distribution in plasma radiation sources is both a yardstick for measuring the coupling efficiency of the generator, and a means of studying the implosion dynamics of the load.  Since the current distribution cannot be directly measured, it must be deduced from the magnetic field profile.  Magnetic field distributions, based on the Faraday rotation of polarized laser light, are typically determined from intensity measurements of two polarization components.  They are therefore susceptible to background emission problems.  A differential interferometric technique is proposed to infer the magnetic field form the phase difference between the right and left circularly polarized components of a laser beam traversing a plasma.  The phase of the two circular polarizations will be simultaneously recorded using a two reference beam hologram.  The two reference beam holographic recording allows heterodyne techniques to be used during reconstruction for enhanced sensitivity.  This is two to three orders of magnitude more sensitive than a typical Faraday rotation measurement.  A third reference beam will be used to record a no plasma hologram needed to measure the electron density distribution.  This technique allows the magnetic field profile to be measured with better sensitivity and less susceptibility to background emission than Faraday rotation techniques.  A successful program will provide the PRS community with the first measurement of a magnetic field distribution In a PRS load.  This is critical to the design of such devices and the comparison with theory.",

Most on-line fluid flow meters require independent determination of the fluid density while Coriolis type meters, which directly measure the fluid mass, are off-lie devices.  HY-Tech is proposing to develop a laser based diagnostic techique for measuring the fluid density on-line with an accuracy approaching 10 ppm.  The technique is applicable to measuring the absolute density of single component gases independent of pressure or temperature and the concentration of liquid solutions.  The technique will find widespread application in manufacturing processes where the monitor and control of fluid mixture concentrations is critical.",

        "abstract": "Although many fluorophores exist which are suitable for labeling biomolecules, most of them have absorbance and fluorescence wavelenghts which overlap with naturally occurring biological fluorescence.  This complicates their use with optical bio- sensors.  A very limited number of commercially available near-IR fluorophores exist (e.g., Cy-5, Cy-5.5, Cy-7) which contain suitable reactive groups for coupling.  How- ever, these fluorophores have relatively small Stokes' shifts and less than optimal photostability.  Innovation Associates proposes to develop a new class of near-IR fluorophores which utilize aromatic molecules absorbing in the near-IR to chelate metals in a manner which permits charge transfers from the ligand to the metal.  This will give rise to a series of fluorophores which are all excited at the same wavelength but which exhibit fluorescence at various near-IR wavelengths, depending upon the metal.  Because ligand-metal charge transfer chelates generally display larger Stokes' shifts and sharper fluorescence bands than purely organic fluorophores, discrimination of a fluorophore's emission from other fluorophore emissions and from the stimulating laser diode will be simplified.  Such a series will be ideal for simultaneous meas- urement of several analytes in, biological fluids by means of fluorescence measure- ments at several wavelengths. A family of near-",

        "abstract": "With power consumpition becoming prohibitive, SOI has become a key technological approach for production of integrated circutis with markedly reduced power requirments. SOI provides improvement (maintenance) of circuit performance and reduction of power consumption, largely independent of circuit architecture. Improved modelilng is a way of reducing the escalating cost impact of technology and product developments. Various parallel (some redundant) projects are focused on model development for particular types of SOI devices, but no comprehensive SOI circuit design models are readily available commercially. It is the purpose of this project to compare the modeling approaches for SOI devices, determine suitability for circuit level modeling which provides power estimation and parametric analysis for [low] power optimization, examine tradeoffs in efficiency and [power consumption predictive] accuracy, develop or modify models as required, and apply the model to test circuits to estimate power reduction. One or more commercial vendors will be involved for transfer of results to commercially available circuit design software. Key aspects of the desired modeling approach will be: comprehensiveness of device modes and types, applicability to perform parameter optimization, and inclusiveness of key SOI parameters for low power level estimation. Device data will be used for model verification. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: The project will provide a needed design tool for SOI circuits, which can be expected to promote SOI technology use.  Sensitivity to technology parameters will be identified to optimize power reduction, analyze cost tradeoffs, and design Phase II experiments. The ultimate goal of the project is installation of useful SOI CMOS LPE design. Ibis's involvement in this effort will enhance technolgoy transfer.",

Several competing formulations will be developed. A potential breakthrough entails a formulation that develops (i) a neural module that separates mixed signals or signal and noise from measurements in dynamic and cluttered environments, with very minimum assumptions, (ii) subsequent modules that initially preprocess the signals via a bank of filters in line with the cochlea's models, followed by an identification stage of the static \"features.\" For part (ii), an alternative approach will pursue a direct formulation based on optimal filtering and control to develop identification networks for temporal signals. The Phase I effort will validate and evaluate the proposed explicit algorithms within a simulated mixing environment containing a combination of dynamically changing signals at varying levels of interference. The developed algorithms will be coded in a tailored C/C++ development code with graphics capabilities for demonstration. A real-time computing environment for separating mixed signals/signals and noise is expected. This algorithm is novel and departs from known methods in industry. The benefits include the ability to eliminate noise from speech signals or sounds of different vehicles/aircraft/missiles.",

        "abstract": "Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) offers many advantages for utility applications.  The only commercially available SMES products are for less than 3 MJ applications.  In the future, larger SMES products will be used to service many applications, such as a large industrial park or a utility substation.  The step in magnet technology from a few MJ coil to a 10 MJ coil is not a large one.  More important is the ability to continue to make steps to higher energies and delivered power as required.  In this SBIR program we propose to analyze, develop, and demonstrate the advantage of using a Multi-Wind Solenoid approach, over that of single solenoids or modular toroids.  The Multi-Wind approach offers the advantages of higher reliability, maintainability, and dramatically reduced external field.  The modular approach allows even 1000 MJ systems to be transportable by trailer with only limited site integration.  In very large systems, conductor savings and reduction of discharge losses are possible. In Phase I of this SBIR program we will perform a detailed comparison of the Multi-Winding and Single Solenoid approaches for energies for 10 MJ and higher.  A conceptual design of a 10 MJ/i MW demonstration system using two or more modules will be initiated. In Phase II, a sub-scale demonstration magnet system will be designed, fabricated, and tested.  A utility partner will be sought for an actual demonstration of a subsystem.",

        "abstract": "With the increasing need for devices such as optoelectronics, which require different materials properties than silicon, new compatible materials and fabrication processes must be developed. A germanium silicon layer embedded in a silicon wafer provides new materials properties while keeping the silicon substrate. Molecular Beam Epitaxy has been used to make prototypes, but a manufacturing technique compatible with production lines is still to be found. Ion implantation to alloy thin germanium silicon layers in masked patterns would seem to be an ideal solution, but residual implantation defects have so far prevented  the manufacturing of such devices with satisfactory electrical properties . The goal is to obtain a 0.20eV bandgap decrease for optoelectronics applications, and this is obtained with an unstrained layer of 50 at% germanium. Such a high implant concentration can normally not be achieved because of sputtering limits and severe surface erosion. These problems can be solved by a recently developed novel \"zero\" sputtering technique combined with high temperature implantation. GeSi layers can be manufactured by conventional process equipment that are 0.5 micrometers thick and should exhibit acceptably low defect densities. The need for semiconductor materials with different properties then silicon but are still compatible with conventional processing lines will keep on increasing for optoelectronics, high speed devices or other applications. Patterned silicon germanium layers imbedded in silicon wafers provide such advantages. Developing a satisfactory manufacturing process based on ion implantation would allow the design and production of many such devices.",

The proposed program will design, fabricate and test a prototype source using an innovative new method of generating atomic nitrogen.  The method uses a chemical reaction to strip a nitrogen containing gas to produce atomic nitrogen in a neutral beam with an energy of 0.24eV.  In addition, the atomic nitrogen flux at the substrate is estimated to be greater than 10(15)/cm(2)ser with less than a 30% molecular N(2) content.  This high flux of atomic nitrogen will permit MBE growth at much lower chamber pressures than present technology.

Specifically, functional gradient ceramic-titanium materials (FGMs) will be fabricated by vacuum cathodic arc - a high throughput, low temperature industrial process - capable of handling large, complex shapes and wide range of material systems.  FGMs produced by cathodic arc are fully dense and adhere well to the substrate.  The FGM layer is deposited beneath the surface of the ceramic substrate and then grown outward with its composition changing gradually from 100% ceramic to 100% titanium.  The FGM is brazed to a titanium alloy backplate by liquid interface diffusion - a commercial process that has been used for over 20 years to bond titanium.  In Phase I, two FGM systems will be selected for study based on a review of existing ceramic property database and the compatibility of the ceramic with titanium.  FGMs 100 mm square will be fabricated and the influence of material parameters and process variables on microstructure, compositional transition and gradient properties will be determined.  Selected systems will be modelled using MARRS and limited ballistic tests conducted.  An excellent support team has been assembled: Alme and Associates, UDRI, Ceradyne, and Rohr Industries.",

        "abstract": "New submarine missions will require submarines operating in littoral waters to monitor non-radiating aircraft in their operational areas while remaining electromagnetically silent themselves. Conventional passive sensors such as ESM and IR will be ineffective against silent aircraft, and conventional radar sensors will compromise the submarine's own security. Consequently, new passive sensors are required that can detect and track such aircraft. ISL proposes that submarine sensors detect and track aircraft by observing the effects of the aircraft on the existing ambient electromagnetic signal environment. The electromagnetic environment is rich with signals emitted from commercial radio stations, television, radar, and satellites. These electromagnetic signals are scattered by the aircraft and can be received at the submarine using existing antennae. The scattered signals are delayed and frequency (doppler) shifted to an extent that depends on the aircraft position and velocity. Time and frequency shifts can be measured relative to the unscattered direct signal also received on the same antenna. By monitoring several signals, the position and velocity of the aircraft can be estimated without radiation from the submarine or aircraft.",

        "abstract": "Closely-spaced, co-channel (same time and frequency) signals, interference, and jamming can severely degrade the performance of communication, radar, and signals intercept systems.  The ability to maintain communications in operational scenarios encountering closely-spaced, co-channel signals using signal processing techniques will provide the Navy with increased operational capability without the need for increasing the amount of space required by existing antennas. Adaptive signal processing of receive antenna element outputs can suppress cochannel interference and separate communication signals of interest to allow copy and analysis of the communication signals.  These spatial nulling techniques are very effective when the interference and the communication signals are well separated in angle of arrival (i.e. in the sidelobe of the unadapted beam) and can be designed to work when the angular separation becomes small.  Alternative algorithm (and variations) for controlling adaptation are available with performance, cost (complexity), and applicability (scenario) tradeoffs. ISL proposes to explore signal processing techniques which extract the original transmitted signal from an environment of closely-spaced communication signals, interference, and jamming which way arrive from angles close to that of the communication signals.",

Demonstrate an analysis methodology for the integration; 2.  Simulate the Model Management integration; and 3.  Demonstrate the \"integrated\" decision aid system.  Our techncial approach is: 1.  Decompose existing, well studied, trackers intodefining graphs; 2.  Create hypercard stacks that establish the relations among input, output, constraint and operations objects; 3.  Simulate the intersection of the tracker parameters in a demonstration; and 4.  Report the reception of the mock-up by users.",

        "abstract": "During the last two decades, software to support the manufacturing lifecycle has become pervasive.  Sophisticated off the shelf packages are available for most standard manufacturing activities such as MRP, inventory control and dynamic scheduling.  Unfortunately, most of this software has been developed in isolation by independent vendors and does not interoperate well with other independently developed packages.  This can often be problematic since the manufacturing environment is too multifaceted for a single vendor to provide a total solution, making data exchange and integration a necessary if unpleasant fact of life in Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) environments.  What is required to enable this installed base of \"legacy\" applications to interoperate with new standards based processing models is a meta translation layer which we have named the Intelligent Translation Layer (ITL).  The purpose of the ITL is to provide a migration path between the current \"islands of automation\" model of industrial computing and a fully integrated, object oriented CIM environment such as that envisioned in the Semetech CIM Application Framework.  The purpose of this Phase I effort is to define a detailed architecture for a data translation layer that embodies the necessary functional requirements as outlined in the proposal.  Phase II will expand upon the Phase I work to produce a working prototype of the ILT and a demonstration using one or more \"live\" applications.  Commercialization potential for such a tool is essentially unlimited.",

        "abstract": "Development of an expendable observation vehicle is proposed which is capable of launch from guns with calibers from 120 to 155 mm, sustaining set-back loads of 15,000 g. A 10-pound payload of sensors and guidance and communications gear is to be carried in a loiter pattern at 10,000 feet altitude for 3 hours.  A conceptual design for the vehicle was generated which meets the competing requirements for set-back load, launch weight and flight time while providing sufficient airspeed to sustain a prescribed search pattern through prevailing winds.  The need for high L/D and high span loading is met by a wing with inflated spars supporting a fabric skin.  The technology for this structure is proven and provides an efficient, affordable, gun-harden0d wing.  Four folding fins stabilize the vehicle in ballistic flight and generate the roll torque commanded by a simple but effective flight controller.  Propulsion is provided by a Wankel rotary engine fueled by propane and driving a pusher propeller, the rotary engine being well suited to gun hardening. The flight configuration has aspect-ratio 8 60-inch winds and 28.1 lb gross weight, for an airspeed at maximum endurance of 64 KTAS.  Phase I objectives will be met by generating detailed designs for all OV elements and identifying those subsystems requiring risk-reduction testing in Phase II.",

It is also desirable that this navigational range estimate be suitable for usage in an automatic or manual vehicles guidance or control system.  Consequently, the candidate algorithm must also be amenable to implementation and evaluation on a real-time information processing system during the subsequent Phase II effort.  The proposed visible/IR sensor fusion algorithm will be based on selecting and correlating features that maximize luminance contrast of 11 x 11 (say) image pixel tiles.  The proposed sensor/terrain (airport) database range correlation algorithm will be based on representing the terrain as a compact wireframe model and correlating the multispectral stereo sensor based imagery with the corresponding wireframe model based synthetic imagery extracted from the prestored airport database.  The need for multispectral sensor fusion is driven by the wide dynamic range of the ambient illumination typical of outdoor imagery.  The requirement for stereo sensors and sensor/database correlation is driven by the need to generate consistent and sufficiently precise range estimates, suitable for real time vehicle guidance and control applications.  It is anticipated that this technology will be required by the planned national airspace plane, due to crew station visibility restrictions during approach and landing operations.",

This Phase I feasibility effort is based on the premise that these theoretical developments have now progressed to a stage where a \"robust generic multi-parameter adaptive control system design\" can be implemented (e.g., Phase II) as a generic multichip module (MCM) based controller by complementing existing design tools (i.e., INCA, Control Wave, Matlab), together with multiparameter visualization aids on a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) multiprocessor.  Such an MCM based controller, with an appropriate user friendly (i.e., downloadable control software) interface, can be utilized by system designers to enhance their design turnaround capability, leading to the next generation of high performance dynamic systems. A proof of concept problem will be selected from several relevant-adaptive control (e.g., 2 input/multiple output) related design problems.  Subsequently, ground validation of the advanced MCM controller based system concept will be undertaken in Phase II, with breadboard hardware.",

ILS is an extremely sensitive technique that has already been demonstrated to be of commercial value for detecting microcontamination (molecular/atomic/radical/ionic) species of importance in the semiconductor manufacturing industry.  For example, ILS absorption can detect water vapor at less than 100 parts per trillion volume (pptv).  ILC will utilize its established ILS expertise in Phase I to develop a conceptual design and determine performance specifications for an ultra-light, portable and low-cost ILS device with the high sensitivity (less than 1 ppbillion) critical for environmental monitoring of combustion products.

        "abstract": "In the past two decades we have witnessed a tremendous growth in the application of solid-state microwave technology in the military, commercial and research arenas. However, solid-state sources are inherently low power and with increasing frequency the power output from a single device decreases rapidly. Therefore, the many advantages of operating at higher, millimeter-wave frequencies (e.g. increased bandwidth, improved spatial resolution, more compact, lightweight systems) have been difficult to realize. In addition, in many of the above applications both transmitter and receiver systems often require an electronic scanning capability. IR&T proposes to provide low-cost, reliable solutions to both of the above problems through the application of innovative quasi-optical millimeter-wave circuit technology. A quasi-optical diode multiplier array will be integrated with a monolithic beam-steering diode array at 94, 140 and 220 GHz to provide improved reliability as well as tremendous cost savings over conventional MMIC systems. A successful completion of the Phase I/II Programs would find application in a wide range of commercial and military applications. Cost-saving, compact, reliable, millimeter-wave sources combined with electronic beam steering are critically required in developing areas, such as satellite communications, mobile navigation, collision avoidance radar systems, non-destructive testing, radiometric imaging, etc.",

A successful proposal must address one or more of the flow conditions outlined in the solicitation. Measurement response times on the order of one second are necessary and the system must operate unattended for extended periods of time.  The rapid response requirements motivate the use of optical, laser based instrumentation. Insitec Measurement Systems has teamed with Sandia national Laboratories/California to develop an instrument that meets the technical criteria outline in the solicitation. By combining Insitec's knowledge of particle characterization using Single Particle Counting Technology with Sandia expertise in Tunable Diode Laser spectroscopy, an instrument can be designed that is capable of measuring vapor-phase and condensed phase moisture simultaneously, in real-time, over all of the conditions posed in the solicitation and within stipulated uncertainty limits. The successful integration of these two techniques using a single illumination beam to simultaneously measure moisture concentrations in each phase is a novel concept forming the basis of this proposal.",

The concept is based on the use of a novel electron Fabry-Perot interference effect which achieves population inversion by free electron injection at a convenient voltage level for highpower applications.  The laser consists of a single stack of III-V semiconductor layers produced by advanced MBE techniques.  Preliminary experiments have shown that the energy states have approximately the expected energy levels and cross sections.  In Phase I the current density will be increased to lasing threshold and a prototype laser with one watt output will be fabricated.  Actual lasing action will provide a demonstration of feasibility.  In the option task a Ge waveguide approach will be studied for suitability for high power lasers.  The use of Ge removes the need for AlAs cladding layers with AlGaAs MBE growth reduced by a factor of 10.  Furthermore, removal of the AlAs cladding improves stability, reduces electron conductivity problems in the AlAs, and provides greater thermal conductivity for high power lasing.",

Intelligent Automation has designed and is currently building an entirely new type of electronic camera. Our camera will generate 3 dimensional images in real-time. By \"3 Dimensional Image\" we mean that the value of each pixel in the image will represent the distance from the camera's focal point to the corresponding point in the scene. We call this type of image a \"range image.\" Our camera will be able to produce RSI70 compatible range images at 60 frames per second, or many times faster for special applications.  Under other funding we are building a prototype range camera for long range applications, and for applications where ambient light cannot be controlled. Under the work herein proposed, we will develop and validate approaches to increase the accuracy of the range camera to where it will have sufficient accuracy for application in real-time dimensional inspection, and even more importantly, real-time process control. For those inspection applications requiring the camera to be moved, we propose to exploit a hexapod structure as a motion stage for the camera, yielding a new class of Coordinate Measuring Machine. Anticipated Benefit: Closed-loop in-process control of many manufacturing process requires real-time dimensional inspection, and IAI's range camera makes this feasible for applications where it was not previously feasible. When configured as a coordinate measuring machine (CMM), the camera will make 3,900,000 measurement per second, as compared to several seconds per measurement for a conventional CMM.",

The integrated structure is based on novel combination of three simply implemented potentially low-cost technologies: (i) Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBGs) produced by rapid laser writing, (ii) side-polished fibers or Fiber Half-Couplers (FHCs), and (iii) Active Optical Polymer (AOP) overlays. The FHC/AOP combination forms an asymmetric coupler whose transmission can be made particularly wavelength selective via judicious parameter choice. This feature is enhanced by FBGs. Both wavelength and coupling strength are tunable via AOP nonlinearity. Phase I objectives are: (i) to make use of IFOS's extensive light guide modeling and analysis capabilities to design an electro-optically tunable fiber-optic filter to satisfy the requirements and predict its performance, (ii) to implement a feasibility prototype demonstrating the effect of parameter choice on wavelength response and tunability, and (iii) to characterize its behavior (tuning range/speed, resolution, insertion loss). The proposed innovative high-speed tunable optical filter has the potential for low cost  manufacturability, low power requirements and  compactness. As well as in DOD's communications and computing programs, it can be used in commercial advanced WDM communications and sensor  systems, intelligent fiber systems and  spectroscopy.",

The baseline system consists of an integrated optics gyroscope and a micro-opto-mechanical accelerometer. The accelerometer uses optical techniques to measure the response of the silicon micromachined flexures to acceleration. In Phase I, we will demonstrate feasibility of a silicon integrated optics gyro by performing a rigorous design and performing several manufacturing steps. In Phase II, we would optimize the gyroscope concept demonstrated in Phase I, produce and evaluate the performance of the gyro and integrate it with a micromachined accelerometer in a monolithic inertial measuring unit (IMU) system. The micromachined optoelectronics gyro proposed has two unique technological features: (1) a sensitive measurement technique using ring resonators and (2) unique material processing for the waveguide formation. The resonator technique has the advantages of high performance with low sensitivity to thermal variations, non-homogeneity and material residual stress. The processing technology uses micromachining to produce miniature, low cost and batch fabricated devices compatible with standard integrated circuit (IC) processing. An all integrated optics gyroscope has applications in DoD missile and projectile guidance systems as well as in commercial avionics. Low cost versions can be used in automotive and robotics applications.",

The proposed tester makes use of a PC compatible computer and of a bank of microprocessors to independently and simultaneously exercise a large number of devices through multiple read and write cycles. The software polling of the independent microprocesors allows to generate the statistics for the various devices under tests as well as complete identification of the type of failure observed. Full control of the ambient temperature for the tests is achieved through the use of an oven and temperature controllers with set points defined by software for unattended operation.

While the Army has long recognized the excellent potential to reduce dry weight and improve fuel conversion efficiency by scaling up to high engine speeds and alternator frequencies, the stumbling block has been in the development and skillful implementation of Power Frequency Conversion (PFC) systems that do not significantly offset the potential advantages.  A program to develop a new generation of tactical power generator systems using the HFA-PFC approach is proposed.  The proposed effort is highly leveraged against ongoing research being carried out by the proposing firm under the auspices of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA).  Under this effort, the Principal Investigator has demonstrated a 500 Watt, 1 lb permanent magnet HFA that scales readily to tens of kilowatts.  For the proposed effort, InterScience, Inc. shall develop system integration strategies to combine advanced engines, high frequency alternators, and power conversion topologies, devices, and control algorithms.

ISC's self-aligning flip chip bonding process has been used successfully on several electro-optical programs. It involves the insertion of an array of solder bumps into a matching array of polyimide sockets. The bumps carry the electrical signals along with excess heat and the sockets provide self alignment and solder damming. A logical extension of this concept would be to use the polyimide for socketing and as a waveguide material. As the laser diode or photodiode is brought into very high precision alignment by the mating of the bump and socket, then the respective emitting and detecting regions of these devices are also automatically aligned to the pre-existing waveguides. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Commercial Applications of the Research or Development. The development of SAPOEIC will provide a base which will allow fabrication of commercial and military opto-electronic integrated circuits for digital as well as analog applications. With additional reliability, lower cost, and improved performance, the production of OEICs will become more common. As these become more available, communication function design will",

To increase the efficiency and reduce the weight of tactical gen-sets we propose the following: Connect a power frequency converter to a light weight high frequency alternator that is driven by a stationary diesel engine. The frequency of the output voltage will be controlled by the power frequency converter and therefor is independent of engine RPM.  To further improve the efficiency, the power frequency converter will have the ability to adjust the engine speed for different loading conditions.

        "abstract": "Semiconducting lasers, laser arrays and other diode-laser devices for both military and private sector applications benefit greatly if used in conjunction with isolators capable of preventing reflections from reentering the device. This proposal describes an approach which can be integrated with laser/amplifier semiconducting material system, to produce efficient non-reciprocal magneto-optic isolators. The method is based on the use of Faraday rotation in ferromagnetic metal films. The isolator(s) may be monolithically integrated with diode lasers, amplifiers, arrays, switches, and modulators to give far superior performance to present state-of-the-art devices. Isolators integrated with diode-laser devices will find extensive use in all applications using diode lasers. Civilian and military fiber and space communication devices lidars and other military and civilian applications requiring stable-high-power-coherent radiation from compact efficient sources will all benefit from the availability of monolithically integrated isolators.",

In our approach we will: simulate sensor images using validated image processing algorithms; assess sensor performance to detect changes in prior images; examine trial launch and deployment approaches for low, medium, and high altitude satellites; and for defining the figure of merit, model relationships between sensor configuration parameters and derive weighing functions and boundaries for the parameters.  We investigate these sensor classes because: the CMT provides a baseline to reference performance and competitive merit, model relationships between sensors configuration parameters and derive weighing functions and boundaries for the parameters.",

The method involves a correction scheme for measuring the vector sum of all sources of undesirable r.f. signals within the anechoic chamber as seen by the antenna under test.  This would be done for all angles of concern of the antenna under test (nominally +/-90 degrees). During the initial measurement process, direct radiation from the source antenna to the antenna under test would be absorbed by a specially designed absorber block located between the two antennas. Scattering from the absorber block to the sidewalls of the chamber will be kept to a minimum by the judicious use of absorber material in conjunction with the designed shape of the absorber block.  The scattering characteristics of four different absorber block configurations will be modelled as well as the scattering characteristics of all multipath error sources in a typical anechoic chamber.  The vector sum of the fields received by the antenna under test with the absorber block in the anechoic chamber and with it removed from the chamber for all angles of concern will be calculated (measured during Phase II).  The minimally distorted antenna pattern is calculated by subtracting the first set of data from the second set of data.",

The PTC systems, consisting of heat pipes, have an excellent history of reliability, but have a limited capacity for the transport of heat flux. The PFL systems, on the other hand, can dissipate large amount of heat, but not as reliable due to the usage of a mechanical fluid pump. This proposal will develop and demonstrate a new heat exchanger that will have the performance of PFL, and the reliability of a passive heat pipe. Furthermore, the new nano-scale pumping unit of this proposed system can be adapted to current and future micro-channel heat exchangers. There are three anticipated benefits. The obvious direct benefit is to provide thermal management devices for the growing satellite market. The second direct benefits is to improve the heat transfer capabilities, and hence the downsizing of heat exchangers currently used in many industries such as automotive and chemical plants. The third benefits is the development of micro-pumping and tubings. Commercial applications and benefits of micro-machinery technology are so large and vast that it cannot be predicted at this moment.",

Needs exist for nondestructive evaluation (NDE) technologies that can reliably detect, classify and size discontinuities in weldments, and that use this information to determine if the defects are acceptable or rejectable.  Recent work performed by the Naval Surface Warfare Center with ultrasonic NDE methods have identified procedures and algorithms that address these needs.  Independent research efforts, funded by the electric utility industry, have similarly indicated the potential of automating ultrasonic methods for the inspection and evaluation of pipe welds. Results from these programs are proposed to be used in this project to develop a real-time ultrasonic weld inspection and evaluation system. In Phase I, we will focus at advancing the state-of-the-art in two areas, namely: (1) the development of a sensor that can automatically track the position of an ultrasonic transducer, during manual scanning and (2) the development of a neural network based software package that can classify, size, and evaluate defects from ultrasonic NDE images. Feasibility studies performed in these areas should pave the way for the development of a system that can be used with manual and automated scanning techniques for weld inspection and evaluation.",

Seats will be designed with at least the following three philosophies:  -  maximum component interchangeability with current metal seats, -  minimum weight with litter emphasis on cost, and -  \"balanced\" cost, weight, producability and performance.  All designs will emphasize application of composite materials. Heavy emphasis will be placed on the design of parts for eventual use of low cost automated manufacturing technologies such as pultrusion, RTM, braiding and filament winding whenever possible.

For quick response to an oil-spill, SOSES (TM) Processor Sleds can ba air-lifted to the oil-spill site and, using lical ships of opportunity, immediately deployed. The utilization of natural nutrient-enhancing emulsifying agents results in an output from the Sled-Processor that is a stable oil-in-seawater emulsion suitable for rapid bioremediation by the oceans indigenous oil-eating bacteria. The operationally difficult, ineffective, and tardily deployed skimmer oil-recovery ships would not be required. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: The potiential for commercial use of this technology is extremely high.  Potential users are oil companies; the Navy; the Coast Guard; etc.  Applications of the SOSES (TM) to process bilge water contamination will also be important.",

The Situational Filter is a hybrid in which the mental model of the commander directs the process of computer-based categorizing and prioritizing data elements and messages.  In this way, we do not rely on inductive methods of message analysis since these have proven ineffective and brittle.  Instead, the commanders will be able to guide the operation of the Situational Filter by inputting their interpretatioin of the dynamics of the battlefield, resulting in a true hybrid system.  The Situational Filter will be prototyped using an existing shell system that supports the development of categorization systems.  The prototype Phase I proof-of-concept will be evaluated based on its congruence with the information and message priority scores assigned by subject matter experts.  The Situational Filter operating with a closely circumscribed set of inputs, should perform near the level of these subject matter experts, thus demonstrating the feasibility of using a hybrid system to adaptively filter information flow.",

        "abstract": "Klein Associates proposes using a decision-centered design approach to develop an advanced interface configuration for a realistic single- and multi-platform mission rehearsal system. Our approach is contrasted with the more traditional approaches of data- and system-centered design. With decision-centered design the critical and difficult judgments and decisions required for mission success for three platforms will be identified. These will be used as the basis for determining the critical concepts and design features necessary for implementation of the interface. These decision requirements will be elicited through cognitive task analysis (CTA). The results of the CTA, in conjunction with the mission rehearsal requirements by platform, will be used to outline an intelligent architecture for the system interface design. \"Intelligent\" is used to mean a system that provides crews of different platforms with the information they need, when they need it, in a format that supports their use of it, while making effective and efficient-use of the available cpu cycles and bandwidths. The deliverables for the Phase I work will be detailed in a final report describing the requirements for mission success (by platform), decision requirements tables, and design recommendations.",

(LOI) proposes to investigate the development of a novel optical limiter using commercially available materials. The optical limiter operates on the following principles. These are beam self-defocusing and total internal reflection induced by absorption enhanced nonlinearities, and excited-state absorption. The proposed optical limiter offers the possibility of passing low intensity light with low attenuation, but blocking transmission of high intensity laser beam. High response speed in nanoseconds, low clamped output, and high linear transmission can be achieved with this device. During Phase I effort, LOI will prove the feasibility of fabricating such a limiter by using prism arrays filled with nonlinear material. Optimum structure of the limiter and requirements of the nonlinear material and additives will be established. The interested wavelength region of the proposed project is 0.4 to 1.2 micrometer. Applications include protection of optical sensors against high energy laser, when these sensors are used in missile, CCD camera, lidar, range finder, optical power/energy meter, remote sensing system and night vision viewer.

The company has successfully demonstrated a modelocked diode laser system which features hybird modelocking and produces 100 picojoule pulses at 100 MHz.  An advanced wide stripe semiconductor will be obtained and integrated during this effort.  These components, in combination with changes to the optical cavity, are estimated to increase the output energy of this device by an order of magnitude, to over one nanojoule.  Pulse duration of 200 femtoseconds has been achieved with the present design and the second objective of this research will be to shorten this to less than 150 femtoseconds by use of an innovative new type of saturable absorber.  An additional objective of this work is to use the results of laboratory testing to evaluate three approaches to raising diode energy further, with a goal of 10 nanojoules.  A design study documenting the best approach for achieving this level will be a work product of the project.",

        "abstract": "Efficient sources operating in the mid-IR region are required for applications such as laser countermeasures and remote sensing. Available mid-IR lasers suited to these applications employ nonlinear frequency conversion techniques; an approach which is inefficient and requires high intensities. Sources based upon direct generation currently are limited to wavelengths below 3 micrometers. Direct generation of 3-5 micrometer radiation using rare-earth ion activated solid-state materials represents a desirable and efficient configuration for laser sources in the mid-IR. In our pursuit of this goal, we have identified two rare-earth doped solid-state materials with the potential for CW operation in the 3-5 micrometer regime. In each case, efficient diode pumped room temperature operation is obtained through the use of a sensitizer-activator pair. The Phase I program consists of a detailed spectroscopic study of the key material parameters which are critical for mid-IR laser operation. Based upon the results of this investigation, a power scalable CW, solid-state, diode-pumped, room temperature laser will be demonstrated. Additionally, design studies will be conducted for scaling to the 2 W average power level.",

The core laser technology consists of a rare-earth doped solid state gain medium bonded to a nonlinear crystal.  the monolithic structure is close coupled to a diode pump source and forms a compact and efficient intracavity doubled laser.  Using external resonant doubling techniques, the Phase I program will focus on extending the microlaser source to the UV< yielding an efficient diode pumped source at 266 nm.  Our analysis indicates conversion efficiencies approaching 30% are feasible, with a resulting UV power in the range of 200-500 mW from a compact, diode-pumped source.  In comparison to currently available UV sources, the microlaser based design is compact, power efficient, delivers near diffraction-limited beam quality in a TEM00 [sub] mode, requires no water cooling, and is portable.  Our Phase I effort will culminate with a laboratory demonstration and characterization of a microlaser based UV source.",

        "abstract": "Investigation into the use of laser sources for underwater applications has been underway for many years.  To date, there is still need for a laser system which satisfies the requirements of wavelength, pulse width, average power and repetition frequency while simultaneously meeting the constraints of size, weight, efficiency, reliability, and cost.  The system proposed by LPC promises quantum leaps in performance over currently existing technologies.  The proposed system, based on a highly efficient, diode-pumped, frequency doubled solid state laser employing a novel cavity configuration, will provide a superior match to the underwater transmission window than Nd:YAG, while still maintaining a higher efficiency and producing 75% less waste heat.  It follows that this system can generate a higher effective output power and energy in a smaller package.  To overcome fundamental limitations in material properties and generate pulses short enough for high resolution, long range capabilities, our system design utilizes a Q-switched, cavity dumped oscillator followed by a power amplifier in a multi-pass configuration. Preliminary research has revealed that a diode-pumped master oscillator/power amplifier combination, frequency doubled to the blue-green, is the optimum choice for air-to-sea detection, ranging, imaging, and other underwater applications.",

        "abstract": "The difficulties posed by high-speed, large-angle scanning of laser beams have plagued electro-optic systems engineers for decades.  As a solution to some of these difficulties, we propose a novel technique which offers two-axis, high-speed scanning in a random access mode.  The technique differs radically from those pursued previously, in that it is an intracavity technique; i.e., its implementation results in a laser oscillator wherein the axis of the output beam is steered optoelectronically.  As such, we refer to the device as an Optoelectronically Steerable Laser Oscillator (OSLO).  We propose to build a proof-of-principle OSLO which employs a Nd:YAG gain medium and which is predicted to produce an average power of about 1 watt.  Beam divergence when randomly accessing a 64 x 64 array is less than 1 milliradian.  for raster-scanner, we project scan rates of 100,000 to 200,000 lines per second.  The proposed program encompasses an experimental verification of OSLO output power, output beam divergence, angular resolution, and interangle switching speed.  Complementing the experimental activities, we propose to refine our preliminary theoretical model of OSLO operation and to undertake a \"first look\" at the integration of OSLOs into representative laser systems.",

In Phase I, we will execute a comprehensive project to demonstrate each of these points and the overall feasibility and advantages of this new approach, to show the appropriateness of this approach as a basis for encyclopedic browsing, and to develop the basics of an HSI which provides the required domain-independent context-sensitive encyclopedic browsing capability.

Our proposed method uses individual randomly oriented microspheres (glass spheres with a size range of 15 - 30 micrometers in diameter), partially coated with a reflecting surface of aluminum, and incorporated into a liquid carrier vehicle complete with binder agents and dyes as needed.  The proposed coatings could also be adapted to apply robust reflective surfaces to the flight suits and other wearing apparel of the aircrews.  We are proposing a one or two step coating process applied directly to the helmet using a spray system during the manufacture of the helmet.  The major features of our proposed method are: 1. total helmet area coverage for maximum light reflection, 2. increased fight reflection from all angles, 3. fast and cost-effective application, 4. low cost materials and production methods, 5. the capability of changing the color of the helmet and the reflected light color, and 6. no adverse effects to the helmet during damage repair.",

The approach advocated here utilizes the mature 1 um laser technology to pump an optical parametric oscillator (OPO) based on a new nonlinear frequency conversion material, periodically-poled lithium niobate (PPLN).  The Phase I program will characterize a compact and efficient source in the 3.5 um atmospheric window.  The primary objective of the Phase I program is to produce 1 W of 3.5 um radiation at pulse repetition rates of 10 kHz or higher.  The key to this approach is the PPLN material which provides lower oscillation thresholds other than materials, and low absorption for high average power applications.  If successful, this program (after Phase II) will yield a broadly tunable (1.5 - 4.2 um), high repitition rate, solid-state mid-infrared source in a package size of 5000 cm (3) (shoe box size).  The present size of commercial mid-infrared OPO systems are 500,000 cm(3) (coffin size).",

The goal of the proposed Phase I project is the design of the compact opto-mechanical platform that would make this level of integration successful.  Our goal is a platform which can withstand the environmental stresses of temperature, pressure, acceleration, vibration and shock expected in military aircraft.  Our approach entails specifying each optic in the system, and then calculating how motion of that optic degrades the system signal. We will develop a model for how platforms are dimensionally distorted in response to environmental stresses.  The distortion of a platform will be used to calculate the movement of optics and the system signal degradation.  We will choose a platform design and build it to verify our calculations.

Currently, single crystal cubic boron nitride (cBN) can only be grown by the high pressure/high temperature method, which limits the size to a few millimeters. In spite of the small size and poor quality, p-n junctions have been made by the HP/HT method and W detectors and W emitters have been built. CVD methods have produced only poor quality polycrystalline mixed cubic and hexagonal phase which is unsuitable for electronic applications. Availability of cubic boron nitride films in R&D and production quantities for development of UV LEDs, UV detectors, high temperature devices and high frequency-high speed devices and ICs.  cBN is also of interest for its potential to make heterostructures with diamond, which could lead to n-type diamond having a high carrier concentration and a high mobility. In addition to electronic applications, cBN is desirable for high speed tool bits to cut ferrous metals.",

The approach in Phase I will be to evaluate the performance of Li/cUC12 cells with 0.3810.10 mm thick CUC12 electrodes in both laboratory cells and prismatic D size cells with 2.7 x 4.0 CM CUC12 electrodes in hermetically welded steel cases. To improve the safety of the system, oxidation resistant shutdown separators to prevent thermal runaway and venting of cells caused by electrical or mechanical abuse will be prepared and tested above 800C. The recent identification of new thermal fuse materials by LEA, Inc. will permit the preparation of such shutdown separators for the first time.

The devices also exhibit I-V hysteresis in the single electron switching as well as in the classical operation regime (from two different mechanisms). It is expected that these effects may be exploited, resulting in a family of quantum effect components providing unprecedented switching speeds, noise immunity, and low signal operation. We propose a research plan to identify the mechanism behind the single electron switching so it may be further developed for device applications. Phase I efforts will also be directed to optimizing the novel techniques employed in the processing of these unique transistors, while Phase II will concentrate on the development of a ultra-high speed quantum transistor. This family of devices is expected to offer improvements in switching speeds, packing density, and power consumption which are orders of magnitude beyond today's technology. The proposed quantum devices would replace traditional FETs in high-performance computers and digital equipment, and provide increased performance for small signal amplifiers.",

        "abstract": "The use of electric power in aeronautical and space applications shows an increasing trend throughout the years. Equipment used for communication and navigation, control systems, pumps, actuators, precision timing devices, life support systems etc., all require electric power in some form. This creates a need for an invertor which offers: high efficiency, high power density, miniaturization, lower weight, improved EMI performance, and low acoustic noise. Higher switching frequencies for DC to AC invertor operation is an essential requirement for accomplishing the above desirable goals, but the upper limit of the switching frequency of an invertor is limited mainly by the switching losses occurring in the switching devices of the invertor. Recent developments in \"soft switching converters\" promises improved device utilization and substantially higher switching frequencies over their \"hard switched\" counterparts. In soft-switched invertors, a switch will only change state when the voltage across it and/or the current through it is zero, eliminating switching losses. As an improvement to the state-of-the-art in soft switching, the proposed converter will utilize a front end DC voltage notching circuit which will allow the DC link voltage to be brought to zero on command when an invertor switch needs to change state, thus making zero voltage switching possible. This performance advantage will be further leveraged by the use of new electronic switches (Mats) which offer substantially lower conduction losses than traditional devices. The core technology can be applied to motor control, alternate energy sources (such as fuel cells, solar cells, etc.), space power, remote sensing, uninterruptible power supplies, etc.",

The presence of NAPLs at residual saturation in the soil and the subsurface media represents a continuous long-term source of organic contamination to ground water.  An understanding of the transport behavior of hydrocarbon contaminants in the soil is critical in improving mathematical models.  The proposed investigation aims at analyzing dissolution kinetics of residual hydrocarbons in a porous medium employing micromodel studies. Micromodels are artificial glass models of porous media that can be used to simulate transport processes at the pore-scale level.  Mass transfer rate coefficients of residual hydrocarbons will be determined by direct observation of residual hydrocarbons in a micromodel using video images captured by a camera and processed with an image analyzer.  By analyzing the temporal variation in residual hydrocarbon volumes in a micromodel, mass transfer rate coefficients of hydrocarbons will be determined.  In addition, the effects of governing variables such as micromodel patterns and varying flow rates will be evaluated for different hydrocarbons such as TCE, gasoline and fuel oil.",

Parenteral vaccines must be administered by trained personnel, a booster is generally required for maximum protection, they usually contain a single immunogen and require refrigeration.  Bioadherent sustained release microencapsulated (BSRM) vaccines for oral administration will eliminate many of the parenteral vaccine limitations.  The proposed work will utilize recombinant Fasciola hepatica proteins, to form a BSRM staphlococcal enterotoxin vaccine for oral administration.  The Fasciola recombinant proteins were selected because of their natural long term, single dose protection without requiring administration by trained personnel.  Further, a multivalent vaccine could be designed by loading SBRMs containing different immunogens into an outer capsule (i.e., gelatine) for administration.  In Phase I, the in vivo gastrointestinal retention time, diffusion kinetics and serum antibody titers for a BSRM staphlococcus enterotoxin vaccine will be evaluated.

        "abstract": "Fuel cells bring about the direct  conversion of stored chemical energy to electrical energy having efficiencies much higher than those of Carnot engines.  So far, the proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell system is the leading candidate fuel cell power source for many military and commercial applications.  In order to make PEM fuel cell power sources cost-competitive with competing technologies and more effective in meeting various mission requirements, the structure and configuration of fuel cell components need to be optimized with regard to weight, performance, cost and the ability to be mass produced.  The objective of this project is to develop PEM hydrogen-air fuel cells using a simple monopolar structure and extremely lightweight components on a single piece of membrane to meet the specific requirements of the Army as future man-portable power supplies.  Because of the strong dependence on expensive platinum metal as electrocatalysts and its easy susceptibility to contamination poisoning in conventional fuel cells, much effort will be devoted to incorporating novel Pt-free or low Pt-loading catalytic electrodes as an integral part of the fuel cell design.  In particular, a new electroless deposition approach will be used to prepare contamination-tolerant anodes, containing composite electrocatalysts such as Pt-Sn and Pt-Pb, directly on the membrane in order for these soft metal electrocatalysts to be used in a strong acid environment, such as that of a PEM.  Success in this effort will make the use of hydrogen derived from steam reformed methanol hydrocarbon fuels in PEM fuel cells possible and result in the production of long service life, high energy density, low cost, and more competitive fuel cell power source systems.",

        "abstract": "Semiconductor-catalyzed photooxidation of chemical waste is a comparatively recent development which offers several advantages over other know oxidation processes.  The advantages include: 9i) no consumption of expensive oxidant; (ii) catalyst is non- hazardous; (iii) the photocatalytic reactions may be driven by sunlight, and (iv) the oxidation is powerful and leads to the mineralization of the majority of organic contaminants.  However, because only about 1% of the solar spectrum is utilized by highly oxidizing semiconductor catalysts, the quantum yield of photooxidation reactions has to be optimized.  This project pursues the development of an innovative approach to increase the rate of the photocatalytic mineralization of chemical waste, which can be used both in the gas and liquid phases.  This approach is based on combining two technologies: (i) photocatalytic oxidation using the porous semiconductor membranes, and (ii) Lynntech's electrochemical process for generation of highly concentrated ozone.  It is expected that the use of ozone as a reactant in the semiconductor membrane photocatalytic reactor will increase the rate of photooxidation reactions by 2-4 orders of magnitude compared to other enhanced photocatalytic processes.  Lynntech, Inc. will adopt a dual-use development approach because the combined technologies have the potential for waste degradation in both Army and commercial applications.",

Recently, some room-temperature and low temperature molten salt electrolytes have been found to be suitable for the fabrication of lithium-based batteries with improvements in battery conductivity and safety. in this project, it is intended to investigate some of the most interesting molten salts in order to fabricate advanced non-lithium, air and water-stable, rocking-chair type batteries.  'Me key to the proposed battery systems is that room-temperature, air and water stable molten salts will serve as electrolytes as well as provide ions to be intercalated into both anode and cathode without the involvement of any Li ions or metals in the battery systems.  The proposed novel battery system will have, several advantages including: high conductivity, quick reacting, high cell voltage, high energy density, small size, safe to operate, and long service life.

Causing 21 of the 28 EPA superfund sites in theSilicon Valley (Witkowski and Menon 1991), the semiconductor industry was, andcontinues to be, a major produce of hazardous waste.In the fabrication of chrome-plated masks, several chemicals and a significantfraction of the chromium are washed down the drain.  Lynntech, Inc. proposes theapplication of a conducting polymer as a replacement for the resist and mask,eliminating many of the chrome-plate preparation steps and wastes.  In contractsto traditional lithography (where the molecular weight of the resist is alteredduring exposure), substrates are spin-coated with a  monomer and the desiredpattern is exposed.  The exposed regions polymerize, permanently adhering to theplate and replacing the chrome.  The unexposed monomer may be rinsed away withwater and is easily removed from the waste stream.  The polymer itself isenvironmental friendly, and the simplification of mask preparation lowers thenumber and amount of hazardous chemicals which are presently necessary.",

        "abstract": "Insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBT) represent the standard component in converters for electric vehicles and motor control. However, they are a mature technology where only marginal performance improvements can be expected, and improvements in IGBT based converter efficiency can only reflect these incremental improvements.  MOSFET controlled thyristors (MCTs) represent a new class of power semiconducotrs that combine thyristor current and voltage capabilities with MOS gated turn-on and turn-off. Like IGBTs, the MCT is an insulated gate, field controlled switching device, but they provide a lower conduction drop (one third to one half that of the IGBTs), superior surge current, and higher di/dt capability. For electric vehicle applications, where energy storage is at a premimum, a vector controlled, soft switched, MCT based inverter has several advantages over IGBT based systems. While the MCT is able to switch under full power, the resonant, soft switching circuit avoids turn off losses, providing the highest overall system efficiency. This proposal presents a research plan for the development, laboratory testing, and preliminary Phase II plans for in-vehicle testing of a soft switching, MCT based inverter for electric vehicle applications. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: The core technology can be scaled to larger or smaller vehicles (both commercial and military applications), is well suited to hybrid vehicles, and industrial motor control. It offers efficiency improvements in any DC to AC converters, including those for the conversion of alternate energy sources (such as fuel cells, solar cells, etc.), space power, remote sensing, uninterruptable power supplies (UPS), etc.",

        "abstract": "Industrial wastewater containing toxic waste compound and metal ions pose manyproblems of disposal.  The most generally used method of removing metalcontaminants is lime treatment to precipitate metals as hydroxides.  The metalis not normally recovered resulting in the need for sludge disposal.  The costof sludge disposal plus fewer available disposal sites makes that methodincreasing less attractive.  Alternative methods of metal ion removal (e.g. ionexchange and reverse osmosis) have several drawbacks including high equipmentcosts.  Oxidation of organic compounds in wastewater and simultaneouselectrowinning of metals as described in this proposal are of great economic andenvironmental significance.  This proposal describes research to demonstrate thefeasibility of using a three dimensional packed bed electrode as the anode forthe oxidation of organic compounds and another packed bed electrode as thecathode for metal ion deposition.  The two packed beds are separated from eachother by a porous separator and operated as the anode and cathode of a singleelectrochemical reactor.  The proposed method utilizes electrocatalyticconducting particles as the anode bed material for oxidation of organicsprimarily to carbon dioxide and nitrogen.  The metal deposited on the particlesforming the cathode bed can be dissolved anodically to form a concentratedsolution of metal ions which can then be used for further processing to recovermetals.",

Mainstream proposes the use of reversible metal hydrides and subsequent air/oxygen exposure to yield nanoscale powders which can be used as chemical reagents for detoxification of organic wastes.  This innovative approach makes use of the strong internal mechanical forces generated by metal hydride volume expansion/contraction which reduces the metal to finer and finer powders (decrepitation) upon absorption/desorption cycling.  The cyclic hydriding process can be carried out with reasonable costs, since the hydrogen is reversibly absorbed and desorbed (i.e., reusable) on numerous metals (e.g. Mg, Ca, Ca-Ni, Mg-Cu, Ti-Fe, Ti-Cr, Mg-Ni, La-Ni) which have yet to be characterized for chemical destructive capability.  Mainstream's Phase I effort will focus on identifying and characterizing metal oxides which meet the requirements of the Army and have commercializable potential in hazardous waste destruction processes.  Experimental design techniques will be used to evaluate the hydride decrepitation process and the destructive capacity of the resulting powders.  A Phase II effort will design, fabricate, and test prototype production and destruction systems utilizing the optimum powder processing parameters and metal/metal-alloy families identified in Phase I which produce the greatest chemical destruction capacity (CDC).",

        "abstract": "Numerous applications exist where cooling is desired for sensors, for only a small portion of the entire spacecraft orbit. These burst power requirements may also be coupled with a requirement to have no vibration during this data gathering period. This problem is often further complicated by the fact that the cooling temperatures are typically cryogenic.  Such cryocooling requirements are typically in the range of 10 to 180 K. Mainstream has developed an innovative approach which can provide passive cooling in this range with active system recharge and the overall specific capacity is in the range of 200 to 570 Watt-Minutes per Pound! Phase I  will provide experimental verification of this  innovative approach and experimentally derived Hard  Numbers to support the cooling capacity per unit mass  claims in this proposal. The development of a simple, rechargeable, vibration-free, lightweight, compact cooling device (for temperature ranges of 10-180K) has tremendous government and commercial spacecraft applications. In addition there are commercial applications wherever specialty gasses such as liquid nitrogen are used for cooling. Therefore the commercial applications would extend to the thousands of commercial users of liquid nitrogen and other gases which are consumed for cooling in laboratory, medical, and industrial applications.",

        "abstract": "This Phase I project will determine the feasibility of developing a xenon propellant storage system for an electric propulsion engine that offers significant reductions in mass, volume, and storage pressure over the compressed vapor storage currently used. Electric propulsion systems utilizing xenon propellant provide a desirable alternative to other electric propulsion designs for orbital maintenance and transfer, due to higher efficiencies and thrust to power ratios. However, the current compressed storage pressure is 3000 psi, requiring high strength, high mass containers. Currently, the container is 15% of the combined xenon and container mass (for storage of 50 kg of xenon). Storage of xenon in the liquid or two-phase (liquid and vapor) state will reduce high pressure storage dangers by a factor of 20r system mass by as much as 16%, and storage volume by as much as 23%. Phase I of the research will design this system. Overall efficiency and performance of the electric propulsion unit will be improved.  Preliminary Phase I testing will include a proof-of-concept demonstration. Phase II will include design optimization, construction, and testing of the lighter, smaller, safer storage system.  The potential applications for this storage system are numerous. The use of xenon propellant in Hall thrusters and ion engines is fast becoming a competitive component of space exploration, station keeping and orbit transfers. The low pressure, low mass storage system proposed here will reduce costs and provide for the advancement of electric propulsion technologies in commercial and military.",

Now, twenty-five years since their introduction, multi-band, affordable cost phased-array antennas (especially with potential commercial application) are still not within sight.  Malibu Research believes we have a potential way around this impasse based on a dynamic version of our proven FLAPS phased-surface antenna technique.  Our FLAPS phased-surface has the capability of directing RF in specific design directions through the use of arrays of varying length shorted dipoles to generate any surface phased gradient.  To date, we have manufactured FLAPS antenna surfaces using printed-circuit techniques to obtain fixed beams.  However, a means exists to vary the beam electronically by dynamic variation of the dipole pattern.  Specifically, we propose to accomplish this by using a programmable plasma display--similar in nature to plasma display television and laptop computers.  The key points, as delineated in our proposal are as follows:  a) The proposed technique is a merger of two advanced but proven technologies; i.e., FLAPS and plasma display. b) The plasma display elements are highly RF conductive ionized gases.  c)  The resolution, speed and huge number of computer updatable display elements yield a highly dynamic, large RF size electronic antenna with multi-band capability.",

The high repetition rate Q-switched output is electronically tunable from 1 to 20 kHz at near constant average power. This spatially configurable output can be used to pump a number of candidate OPO configurations to produce over 30 Watts of high repetition rate, frequency tunable mid-infrared output. This outstanding efficiency is obtained by applying innovative design concepts to the laser crystal and the slab geometry. These concepts enable the application of a laser material with superior optical and thermal characteristics. Efficient pump absorption is obtained through a proprietary multi-pass geometry in a low Fresnel number mini-slab, which provides superior, low loss, mode control and a projected beam quality ",

The commercial scientific processor technology developed by MAI will be adapted for integration into a submarine combat system to provide a multistatic processing capability that does not require external coordinating data to effectively process the reflected target data. The same architecture will also process transient data in real time. The feasibility of this concept has already been demonstrated, so the technical thrust of phase I efforts will include identifying the underlying capability and physics necessary to permit the multistatic and transient processing to be tactically effective; identifying the characteristics of the proposed product to ensure that it meets the operational and logistical requirements of the submarine and surface ship forces; defining the interface requirements to ensure compatibility with existing submarine and surface ship sensor suites; and developing supporting tactics and employment guidance.",

For full-scale targets at an outdoor facility, the motion may not be known to the degree needed to make the best images, and the equipment being used may not support the stability requirements.  A signal processing technology is offered to solve both of these problems.  This technology, which was developed for aircraft identification via radar, is capable of accurately measuring the motion of individual scatterers on the target, so that the motion can be properly compensated prior to the formation of images.  Any motion can be compensated, such as buffeting of the target by the wind or irregular motion of the turntable, as well as apparent motions caused by errors in the measurement of turntable angle.  This technology is also capable of recognizing which responses in the image are spurious, and where the backscattering originated for the spurious responses.  It should be a valuable tool to customers of the RATSCAT facility.",

        "abstract": "Bismuth rich BiSb alloys exhibit the best n-type thermoelectric properties known.  However, these properties are realized only in single crystals which are difficult to machine because they tend to cleave.  Also, the anisotropic nature of BiSb requires that that the device current be passed across the cleavage planes.  Therefore, single crystal BiSb has not been utilized in devices because the risk of cleavage in service is too high.  Polycrystalline BiSb, made by powder metallurgy techniques, is mechanically robust.  However, the thermoelectric properties of polycrystalline BiSb are inferior to single crystals due to misorientation of the grains.  The degrading effect of grain misorientation may be more than offset by reducing the grain size.  A very fine particle size should cause boundary scattering of phonons thereby reducing the lattice component of the thermal conductivity significantly.  The net effect will be to increase the figure of merit of the BiSb making it a feasible n-type material for cooling applications below 200K.  The goal of the proposed work is to demonstrate that a mean grain size of less than 10 microns can substantially decrease the lattice thermal conductivity of BiSb.",

        "abstract": "Bipropellant Systems usually contain isolation valves feeding banks of thruster valves downstream of the propellant supply tanks. Thruster valve problems, when occurring in operation, could cause isolation valve closure, disabling the remaining \"operable\" thruster in the thruster bank. Marotta proposes to develop an innovative, unique solenoid valve that integrates both the isolation and thruster pulsing bipropellant valve functions. Marotta uses the normally \"passive\" redundant solenoid valve in a more \"active\" magnetically-latching, isolation valve role. The valve also combines the advantages of commonly used bipropellant torque motors and solenoid valves by incorporating \"magnetically' linked fuel and oxidizer valves. Valve performance and dribble volume is subsequently comparable to a torque motor except the construction uses solenoid simplicity at a solenoid price. The proposed valve would replace existing bipropellant, redundant solenoid valves and eliminate the need for individual isolation valves. The valve subsequently permits individual thruster isolation when the thruster experiences difficulties. Although a bipropellant baseline configuration approach is used, the design is easily adaptable to similar dual-feed applications. BMD0 will benefit from an efficient, high-performance duel-feed valve with high reliability at low cost and, compared to existing isolation/thruster valve systems, less weight. Applications for the magnetically-linked concept include commercial space  and industrial applications. The power saving features, the ability to manifold and the ability to provide control from  long distances and/or networking, are requirements of  several industrial and commercial uses.",

        "abstract": "Three-dimensional calculations on printed circuit antennas are usually very difficult, especially when normal conductors are involved as boundaries and multiports are used as excitations.  We have developed two simple techniques to attack such problems. First, we have modified the traditional Green's dyads to include finite-conductivity value of the ground plane.  We have incorporated Wheeler's incremental inductance method in the formulation of Green's dyads.  The finite conductivity of the ground plane has been treated as perturbations to the perfect metal boundary.  As such, it allows us to calculate the conductor loss arising from an antenna array consisting of a larger number of elements.  Secondly, we have established normal mode currents for microstrip patches which serve as basis currents in the expansion of current distribution.  The normal mode currents are expressed as gradients of current potentials which satisfy two-dimensional Helmholtz equation.  The excitation currents for a microstrip or a coax feeder line can be readily expressed in terms of these normal mode currents.  Most importantly, by using current potentials the sixfold integrals required for the calculation of Galerkin elements can be reduced into two-fold ones.  This simplifies the calculations significantly.  Consequently, the coupling between microstrip patch circuitries can be solved using a personal computer.  Radiation patterns as well as radar cross sections associated with normal mode current distributions have also been formulated.  Graphic user interface will be developed in Phase I such that the use of our numerical routines can be an easy and an interesting task.",

However, existing magnetic sensors have performance limits that do not meet advanced undersea weapons requirements, for example.  Therefore, high sensitivity, low noise, highly stable, miniaturized magnetometers are currently in great need.  This requires further research in the fabrication of fluxgate magnetometers, not only in material aspect to provide better core materials, but also in theoretical aspect to investigate the various material parameters in affecting the fluxgate performances.  As such, this proposed SBIR is to develop a general nonlinear analysis for fluxgate operation on one hand, and to develop highly stable sensors for absolute measurement of weak field, and to provide compact inexpensive low-power designs for various search and surveillance operation and for aspect sensing applications on the other hand.  In Phase I we will identify potential fabrication techniques and core material candidates and complete proof-of- concept experiments.  A commercialization path will be outlined.  In Phase II we will design, build and operate prototype fluxgate magnetometers.  We will explore major cost and applicability issues associated with commercialization of our developed magnetic sensors.

Conventional processing techniques such as fluidized bed and electrostatic spray are unable to provide an inert atmosphere, but more importantly, cannot be scaled up to large-scale production.  A novel new technique recently developed at MER has demonstrated the potential for producing large-scale quantities of spherical, micron size, pure metals, intermetallics and alloy powders.

        "abstract": "Conventional composite processing techniques are presently unable to fabricate Al1O3-fiber reinforced y-titanium aluminide matrix composites based on low cost, small diameter ( 5-20um) fibers.  The primary problem is one of infiltration of the matrix in between the fibers without any degradation in fiber properties.  Although pressure casting would be a low cost processing approach, the severe chemical attack by molten metals would limit the performance of these composites.  Instead, an innovative composite processing technique for TiAl-based composites will be demonstrated wherein, starting with a commercial Al2O3 fiber tow, each fiber will be spread and individually coated with the matrix material by a plasma-assisted hollow cathode sputtering process.  The fiber volume fraction within the matrix can be varied by varying the thickness of the coating.  By coating all the fibers to a given thickness, a more or less constant inter -fiber spacing can be obtained in a hot-consolidated state.  Such a composite processing technique is also amenable to tailoring of the fiber-matrix interface by the addition of vary thin coat of metals such as Nb for improved resistance to chemical attack by the matrix.  This Nb layer can also act as a compliant layer, thereby improving the thermal cycling performance of these composites.",

Composites will be produced utilizing Hollow and Planar Cathode Magnetron Sputtering Processing, by depositing a coating of the aluminum matrix material onto continuous and discontinuous graphite fibers (K up to 3000 W/mK), including interfacial layers to assure fiber/matrix bonding and suppression of adverse interface reactions.

Compliance with varying functional requirements (e.g.,high thermal conductivity versus high tensile strength and expansion control) can be accomplished by varying type and fiber/matrix volume ratios. Basic modeling of thermal conductivity, strength, and CTE will be performed and confirmed by analytical examination on composite samples.

        "abstract": "There is a critical need for the development of high temperature, corrosion resistant, low weight, and low cost recuperators to increase the efficiency of advanced gas turbine engines.  The temperature requirements dictate the use of ceramic materials, and the material choice is silicon carbide (SiC) as a result of its high thermal shock resistance, high thermal conductivity, excellent corrosion resistance, and low density.  However, available SiC commercial materials are very costly and lacking in mechanical performance.  This proposal addresses the need for low cost, high performance SiC ceramic materials with the development of two difference SiC materials, i.e. a siliconized SiC fiber reinforced composite and a siliconized SiC monolith with tailorable microstructure.  Each offers the potential for much higher toughness combined with complex shape forming capabilities.  All materials will be fully  characterized, and the optimum materials tested at the Allison Gas Turbine Division of General Motors Corporation.  The program will culminate in the development of a preliminary recuperator design (at Allison Gas Turbine) and a cost analysis for the production of recuperator components.  The determination of fabrication costs combined with assessment of thermal and mechanical properties will determine the feasibility of using the proposed SiC-based materials in recuperator applications.",

In this research, we intend to use polyalkylene glycols as base fluids with environmentally benign additives that greatly reduce the amount of pollutants discharged during routine and extreme environmental conditions.  Polyalkylene glycols possess excellent viscosity index, low pour points, high flash points, good antifoam, good lubricity, low toxicity, good shear stability, arenon-corrosive to common metals have little or no effect on rubbers, and are fire resistant.  For other additives such as antioxidant, antiwear, and antirust agents, we propose to use ashless additives with a benign environmental impact that minimize hazardous waste during the life cycle of this type of aviation lubricant.

However, the turbine hot section is a very harsh environment and current development work has shown that these materials may suffer for environmental degradation during service. The successful application of these materials in man- rated engines requires that the factors contributing to material degradation be recognized, and accounted for. The many possible material combinations and application-specific thermo-mechanical-environmental service conditions renders the development of a purely empirical approach extremely time-consuming and expensive. An alternative approach is to develop some form of mathematical model able to predict material durability based on a knowledge of the material constituents and the general operating conditions (time, temperature, load, etc.).

        "abstract": "The application of high-temperature  refractory materials such as rhenium, iridium and  tungsten to liquid rocket engines holds substantial potential for improvement in the life of the components. Currently, Ir-Re rocket engines and thrusters are manufactured by chemical vapor deposition. Although this technique has been successful, it is plagued by prohibitively high costs and low rate of production thereby hindering the  application of this technology to large engines with a thrust of 44.5 kN or greater. Furthermore, the system itself is too heavy and thus compromises the amount of payload each launch can deploy. In this Phase I, we propose to develop an unconventional dual stage technique for developing ultrahigh temperature materials for these applications with a substantial reduction in the weight of the thruster. We will develop these materials using a synergistic approach combining synthesis and rapid consolidation techniques. This is expected to result in a quantum leap in the advancement of space propulsion technology. The proposed approach is expected to save up to $4-5 million per launch and $25,000 per thruster. Substantially greater savings are expected for larger engines as the efficiency and lifetime of the components are expected to increase. These engines are likely to find increasing use in deployment of commercial satellites especially for Motorola's Iridium, and Loral's - GlobalStar. These companies are expected  to launch over 40 satellites for world wide communication in the next 3 years.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this Phase I is to develop a high quality, high speed, cost effective technique for polishing silicon carbide mirrors that are machined using single point diamond turning methods. The finished optic should have a more perfectly polished surface with uniform shape and thickness than is presently being produced. We will achieve this by using two different approaches, a novel non-contact approach and a second approach that will use micro-contact pressure in the presence of centrifugal forces to smooth the surfaces. Optical characterization will be performed on the polished samples and will be correlated to the as single point diamond turned SiC samples. In Phase II, we propose extending this technique to large optical surfaces by either specially designing or adapting existing manufacturing systems. Coordination has already been initiated with several manufacturers for scale up and testing in Phase II leading to commercialization in Phase III. This technique can be used for other applications involving optical components such as laser cavity mirrors, laser beam mirrors, lenses for telescopes, windows with high optical transmission, optoelectronic detectors, photo detectors, and high power devices.",

        "abstract": "Nanosize, non-oxide ceramic powders such as silicon carbide and its composites, are desirable for use as components in high-power microelectronic devices and tubes, sensors, optical mirrors, filters, nozzles, panels and sheets in many energy related applications.  The properties required for these applications include high-temperature strength, high thermal conductivity, low thermal expansion, lightweight, wear resistance, and excellent fracture thoughness to survive in the harsh environments in which they operate.  Existing methods for manufacturing such nanopowders include press-and-sinter, hot isostatic pressing, reaction bonding, chemical vapor infiltration, and hot pressing.  However, these methods developed to cope with typical ceramic materials having particle sizes of 1-5 um have required the addition of low-melting sintering aids and long sintering times which cause undesirable properties concurrent with unacceptable costs in manufacturing these powders.  In this Phase I effort, we propose to synthesize nanocrystalline silicon carbide employing a dual-stage process.  These powders will be rapidly concolidated enabling the achievement of near-theoretical density, in a very short time, at substantially lower processing parameters thereby resulting in considerable savings in manufacturing and processing costs.  The ability to improve the formability of these nanoceramics will be an added advantage in the fabrication of components.  Phase I will focus on demonstrating the synthesis, consolidation, and characterization while Phase II will concentrate on optimization of process-structure-property parameters that will be used to produce prototype components for use in a variety of applications.  Phase III efforts will focus on the commercial production of these nanoceramic powders and the development of strategic industrial partners.",

In one program, MSI is adapting its piezocomposite designs to fabricate transducers that couple efficiently to air or water.  In another, the company has adapted its injection molding process to form extremely fine transducer arrays, suitable for high frequency applications. In this program, MSI plans to utilize these piezoelectric composite manufacturing capabilities to form 2D arrays for use in 3D ultrasonic imaging.  By appropriately configuring the array elements, a completely new ultrasonic imaging actuation approach has been identified for pulse-echo 3D imaging.  The new design offers low electrical and acoustic impedance, along with ease of fabrication through net-shape injection molding. In Phase I, MSI will utilize its injection molding process to form two new PZT 2D transducer array structures that are configurable to cover a wide range of frequencies for imaging applications from low frequency undersea mine countermeasures to megahertz frequency medical ultrasound.",

Creosote,widely used to protect wood, is a hazardous substance, ID# NA9189.  Creosotetreated waste wood consists of utility poles, pier posts, and railroad ties.  InNew Jersey about 50,000 ton/year are collected, while over the entire USA, anestimated 1.5 M tons/year are collected.  There is no current solution forneutralization or utilization of this hazardous waste.  Controlled temperatureand heating rates (both relatively low ) are used in a fluid-bed pyrolysis unit.The pyrolysis process endeavors to maximize the car-producing and tar-to-car producing chemical roumatrix.  A gas combustor is coupled with the pyrolysis unit, using the off gasgenerated by the retort.  The combustion product gas, with reduced temperature,serves to fluidize the retort.  Overall low temperatures ensure low NOxemissions.  The process is energetically self-sufficient.  The objective of PhaseI work is to demonstrate feasibility in a small 10 kg/hr laboratory scale unit.",

The approach is based on the premise that V-O2FV- O2L, whereas the airway measurement represents whole-body V-O2 which includes the lung. The problclinical researchers is that the combined uncertainties of the independent V-O2 and V- O2Fick measurthe ICU environment, are of nearly the same magnitude as the LMF values to be monitored. This is dueinherent differences in the thermodilution and Fick methods and the necessity of measuring V-O2 undeconditions. Our method retains the principle of determining LMF described above. However, two majorpresent method are proposed: l) The non-Fick Q measurement is replaced with a non-metabolic gas Fickprinciples with the V-O2Fick method; and 2) O2 is replaced by CO2 as the lung metabolism indicator imetabolic and non metabolic gas uptake (production) measurement techniques and to eliminate the needgas flows or volumes. LMF accuracy is thereby reduced to the technical problem of in vitro measuremeconcentration measurements in the blood and gas phases. However, there is presently no blood contentthis task. To meet this need, this group has utilized engineering concepts of the 1990's to re-enginapparatus, developed in the 1920's.

        "abstract": "Cold cathode devices capable of emitting electrons into a vacuum without relying on high temperature thermionic emission are expected to play an important role in a wide variety of applications ranging from high frequency, high power amplifiers to flat panel displays. Cold cathode devices based on negative electron affinity materials rely on semiconductors for which the barrier between electrons in the conduction band and the vacuum level (electron affinity) is negligible. Thus, all the electrons (in the conduction band) reaching the surface of such devices can be swept out into the vacuum. Such devices are expected to provide stable, high-performance operation, even in relatively low vacuum conditions. Recent experimental evidence indicates that several wide bandgap semiconductors, most notably diamond and AlN exhibit an intrinsic negative electron affinity. AlN is particularly interesting because it is nearly lattice matched to SiC and hence may be combined with SiC devices and grown on SiC substrates. In addition, AlGaN alloys will be near perfectly lattice matched, allowing for the use of heterostructures in such devices. In this Phase I project, efficient negative electron affinity devices based upon AlN will be demonstrated.",

The benefits include (1) while the number of wavelengths n may be limited, we can architect a network of size N(>>n) without requiring wavelength reuse and (2) the network throughput is NxD (where D is the data rate) because CDMA permits concurrent communication. In this new Project we propose a potentially significant overlay to the previous contract: a scrambling/descrambling scheme which increases the number of optical CDMA matrices. This gives rise to an EXTENDED WDM/CDMA Hybrid Network which is larger by the EXTENSION factor (n)!/(n-f)!, where f is the number of wavelengths required by the code. The scrambled WDM/CDMA Hybrid signals have a greater degree of data SECURITY than the original unscrambled set. This can be further enhanced by masking with a WDM JAMMER where the remainder spectrum, n-f, is used to obscure the presence of the matrix CDMA encoded wavelengths. The EXTENSION and SECURITY aspects are independent but complementary. The proposed innovation leads to more dense, scalable, Gigabit per second, optical networks with only a few WDM wavelengths and CDMA codes as building blocks. The innovation potentially can have a masking noisy signal superimposed to enhance security in military and commercial 1 area networks and environments.",

METRATEK is in a unique position to accomplish this effort because we have a proven reputation for establishing the state of the art in advanced radar imagine technology and we have already developed and proven the two critical technologies needed to start this effort.  These are (1) our AIRSAR autofocus air-to-air synthetic aperture imaging technology (referred to as a \"national treasure\" by the Secretary of the Air Force), and (2) the Model 300 radar, an extremely wideband imaging radar which can be slaved to existing narrowband tracking radars.  Phase I will characterize the problems to be solved and define specific performance requirements, and then determine how high-quality imaging can be exploited and upgraded to address test center needs.  It will then specify upgrades to WSMR radar and data processing facilities, and define tests that we will conduct in Phase II to demonstrate these capabilities using an existing METRATEK autofocus imaging radar in concert with existing WSMR assets.",

        "abstract": "A simple, remotely deployable fluorometer for oil sheen detection is proposed. This device consists of a high energy UV flash lamp, a series of photodetectors, and a microprocessor. The flash lamp is used to excite hydrocarbons in the oil sheen to fluoresce. The photodetectors detect the fluorescence signals which are sent to the data processing center by the microprocessor via a pocket-radio or telephone line. The center will process the signals to compose the fluorescence spectra that will be compared to oil sheen fluorescence spectral signatures stored in the center computer. Once a fluorescence spectrum matches the signature of an environmentally damaging oil-sheen, the center will issue an alarm. According to a brief calculation, the system is at least capable of detecting a 100 angstrom thin oil sheen. The proposed, compact device is operated by batteries, and thus, is deployable to any location of interest, such as the water-surface, near waste-water exits or ships, providing real-time and in situ monitoring. The Phase I work will demonstrate feasibility by carrying through computer simulations and laboratory experiments. In phase II, a prototype device, including data acquisition and the communication system will be constructed and field studies performed.",

        "abstract": "This research program seeks to develop an innovative and cost-effective in situ geo-environmental immunoassay technique (i) combined in a small, hydraulically driven geotechnical soil probe (e.g. BAT or mini cone, etc.) to detect, characterize, map and quantify, in real-time, the type, extent, and concentration of priority subsurface contaminants by chemical specificity, as well as, (ii) provide geological characteristics such as hydraulic conductivity, porosity grain size etc.  The prime advantage of the proposed in situ geo-environmental immunoassay technique is that specific antibodies could be engineered to detect specific contaminants of interest in the subsurface.  When the contaminants come into contact with the immunoassay sensor module (which consists an array of suitable immobilized antibodies, analytes coupled with fluorescent/color producing molecules, for example), the response could be detected via fiber optic cables that can transmit the elicited colorimetric or fluorometric reaction to a recording device.  The signals thus received and other geotechnical instrumentation response will be processed in real-time, and interpreted to predict geo-environmental conditions, nature and quantity of contaminants present as well as geological characteristics.  Currently on-going preliminary studies being conducted by this research team indicate high potential for success of this new approach to identify several priority contaminants at very low concentrations.  The Phase I of this work plan seeks to design, and develop a miniaturized sensor module combined in a small soil probe based on the above concept and evaluate its effectiveness.  The results of this study will prove the feasibility of the concept and produce quantitative data on effectiveness of the sensor and its system characteristics.  The necessary data acquisition, signal processing technologies and schemes for real-time quantitative interpretation and display of results on a remote computer screen (or storage) will be developed as a part of this effort.",

        "abstract": "During the storage of hydraulic components small amounts of water and other contaminants can cause corrosion on the metallic surfaces.  The resultant corrosion can lead to failure of the component by plugging small orifices or by destroying critical surfaces around seals.  To prevent this corrosion, additive such as barium dinonylnapthalene sulfonate (BDS) are dispersed/dissolved into the oil.  While BDS is an excellent corrosion inhibitor, it also contains barium which is a heavy metal targeted for removal from military uses.  This creates a challenge to find a new corrosion inhibiting compound with the same or better inhibition properties but without the heavy metal component. METTS proposes that non-heavy metal containing versions of these corrosion inhibitor compounds be considered, such as the calcium dinonylnapthelene sulfonate (CDS) and related salts.  CDS and variants of CDS are currently used in paints and coatings as corrosion inhibitors on bridges and other facilities exposed to harsh environments.  METSS possesses the needed expertise in corrosion inhibition and formulation in order to properly select and formulate a new corrosion inhibited hydraulic oil/fluid.  Zinc phosphate corrosion inhibitors are also used extensively. Specifically, the organic and molybdate modified zinc phosphate see wide usage an provide excellent protection.",

Due to their unique capabilities, they have considerable potential as in- place sensors for engine condition monitoring, especially as real-time monitors of lubricants, fuels, and hydraulic fluids. This was recently demonstrated in a cooperative program with the Carderock Division, NSWC, that resulted in development of a Fuel Dilution Meter and a Total Base Number Meter for shipboard monitoring of diesel engine lubricants. In this proposed Phase I SBIR program, it is planned to design and evaluate other classes of chemical microsensors as specific monitors for total acid content (TAN) and water contamination using similar instrument design principles. The Phase I study will focus on two promising solid-state sensor technologies for determining the acid content of hydrocarbon fluids. These will be organic chemiresistors and adsistor type resistive films, both of which can be highly sensitive to changes in acidity of a contacting phase. Organic semiconductors are known to exhibit very large changes in conductivity with increasing hydrogen ion concentration, while the thin aluminum lines of an adsistor show large changes in resistivity due to acid induced corrosion. Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) devices with water sensitive coatings will be evaluated as sensors for water contamination. A number of devices of each type will be fabricated and tested. Sensors with the best performance and physical properties will be selected for Phase 11 development of prototype shipboard monitors for water contamination and total acid content of petroleum based fluids.",

At the same time there are concurrent research programs to develop sub 0.25 micron devices using prototype imaging techniques, such as e-beam lithography.  Many advanced devices with Defense applications are manufactured in compound semiconductor materials such as Gallium Arsenide where poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) resists are widely used.  Environmental concerns and public awareness have led to legislation encouraging the replacement of hazardous and ozone depleting chemicals in the workplace.  In many cases this means the replacement of existing process chemicals, including PMMA resists and developers, with newer \"safe-solvent\" alternatives.  We propose to focus our effort on the evaluation of suitable \"safe-solvent\" alternatives for the PMMA and P(MMA-co-MAA) resist systems in processes for which they are most widely used. In these bi- and tri-layer coatings there must be little or no intermixing between the layers during the coating process.  We propose in Phase I to conduct a systematic study to evaluate the performance of selected materials and determine the most promising one or two systems for further characterization.  Phase II will be used to develop and optimize the process using these systems for a range of applications.",

The research involves developing a self-tuning, self-sensing actuator which automatically adapts to changing electrical characteristics (capacitance) of the piezoelectric element and provides a high-quality measurement of either strain, stress, or a combination of both as selected by the user. Several approaches will be considered, with the intent of developing a low-cost analog implementation. The main objective of this Phase I is to demonstrate the feasibility of an adaptive self-sensing piezoelectric actuator under a wide range of possible inputs and for a realistic, nonlinear and lossy piezoelectric material. Phase I will focus on the analysis and simulation required to obtain a design suitable for further development and testing, but will also include some preliminary hardware experimentation. During Phase II a full-scale prototype will be designed, fabricated, and tested. Phase I will establish the feasibility of a Self-Sensing Piezoelectirc Actuator. An inexpensive and effective self-sensing circuit represents significant value added to almost any piezoelectric device.

        "abstract": "The standard AM General HUMVEE has the potential of significantly increased mobility than its currently delivered form. The rough road capability of the HUMVEE is extremely poor due to its limited wheel travel, high spring rates and lack of shock absorber damping. This is unfortunate since the basic size and layout has the potential to work extremely well due to its wide track and long wheel base. The HTMMP vehicle demonstrated 30-50% higher speeds over set test courses despite its much narrower track width. Slow speed performance through the boulder field test course was better. The increased performance was primarily due to its long travel suspension and tuned spring/shock package. This proposal is to develop a kit that can be retrofit to any HUMVEE that will improve the low and high speed mobility of the HUMVEE. The kits will be as low priced as possible (target of $3-5K) and designed to be installed in the field with simple hand tools. In this way, existing inventory of HUMVEEs or new vehicles can be adapted to specific missions in a timely, cost effective fashion.",

It will be able to be tuned rapidly by varying only an external magnetic field.  We have performed initial analyses which demonstrate a 20% tuning range with a fixed geometry.  A much wider tuning range, including the possibility of accessing multiple frequency bands in a single device, can be achieved by incorporating mechanical tuning as well. The source can be optimized to operate at a center frequency from hundreds of MHz to at least 10 GHz.  This source will be capable of pulse durations and repetition rates that are limited only by prime power and power conditioning constraints.  The source can use a high-purveyance electron beam, which minimizes system voltages.  For example, a GW-class device would use a 250-keV electron beam.  The basic principles that are required to realize this source have been experimentally demonstrated and verified with theory and computer simulations.  During Phase I, we will perform additional analyses, simulations, and design studies, including the engineering and design of all critical components, to develop an optimized prototype configuration that can be built and tested during Phase II.",

        "abstract": "A highly innovative, but, nevertheless, low risk, near field measurement system approach is proposed which will cost = $50K for a truly portable system, including the probe position-scanning apparatus (for small to medium sized antennas). The approach uses extremely light-weight probes and cables to allow a corresponding reduction in probe positioning apparatus size and weight. The heavy and expensive microwave receiver is replaced by a much-smaller, lighter-weight, and less-expensive, broadband heterodyne system. The probes are non- perturbing, eliminating mutual coupling - the principal drawback to more widespread use of the near-field method. For this and other reasons, both high accuracy and speed are anticipated. Without change of probe or other components, the system will cover a broad frequency range (e.g., 50 - 1000 MHz or 1 - 18 GHz) and can be used equally well with 0-dBm sources or with high-power transmitters (with safety). The approach is low-risk because it simply combines principles already proven by the proposers. A complete system (with rudimentary position scanning) will be demonstrated in the laboratory during Phase I. An option to develop a non-perturbing radiating-probe capability to complement the primary, receiving-probe approach is also proposed.",

Technologies to fulfill most of these requirements have been developed recently by MRC and others for the DOE ARM-UAV program.  However, some significant technical issues remain, which we propose to address here, leveraging existing capabilities where possible.

(MiTi) has designed a unique shock tolerant magnetic bearing system design that is compact, durable and uses a control strategy that optimizes the total bearing system performance.  The shock tolerant bearing being proposed for this effort builds upon the Navy investment in integrated rotordynamic-magnetic bearing design analyses, and magnetic bearings that have resulted in demonstration of systems designed by the Principal Investigator, for steam turbine generators, vent fans and submerged pump rotors.  Other DOD investments in damping and dry-lubricated high-speed bearing technology provide the basis for the proposed zero clearance auxiliary bearing.  The proposed time transient simulation tool will include multiple and intermittent bearing operation during preshock, shock and post shock conditions and will permit evaluation of integrated control stategies and auxiliary bearing designs that are intended to minimize the detrimental effects of shock events on system operation.  The overall potential of this effort is demonstrated by GE Marine and Industrial Systems' expressed interest in teaming with MiTi to support our Phase I development and for the Phase II and III demonstrations. A four-task six-month effort is proposed that will; (1) add auxiliary bearing analysis into the already integrated rotordynamic-magnetic bearing analysis; (2) establish preliminary magnetic and auxiliary bearing sizes for Phase II simulator evaluation using the developed design analysis, (3) develop a transient rotor bearing simulation analysis capability that accounts for the magnetic bearing, its control system and the auxiliary bearing. (4) Using the developed design and simulation tools a three bearing single rotor, scalable shock tolerant magnetic bearing system and control strategy will be designed for use in the Phase II scaled rotor simulator of a GE Marine and Industrial Systems gas turbine generator representative of identified Navy needs.",

        "abstract": "The overall goal of this proposal is to validate a new principle and method of immunization against the malaria parasite, gen immunization using as a vaccine an immunoglobulin gene re-engineered to encode a discrete epitope of the malaria parasite. We refer to this approach as \"antigenization of antibody\".  As a model system we will use the tetrapeptide sequence Asn-Ala-Asn Pro (NANP) of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum CS protein.  Recently, we obtained evidence that immunization with a plazmid DNA encoding the wild type immunoglobulin heavy chain polypeptide combined with targeting of the lymphoid tissue elicits an antiimmunoglobulin response direct at both the constant and variuable portion of the molecule.  Moreover, following DNA immunization the gene product appears in the circulation for a period of approximately 10 days in quantifialbe amounts. Previosly, we demonstrated that an antiboldy antigenized to express three contiguous repeats of the NANP epitope could be used to induce antibodies reacting wit P.  falciparum sporozoites, a NANP synthetic peptide, and the immunizing antigenized antibodies, and that these atnibodies could inhibit sporozoite invasion of human hepatoma cells in vitro.  In the studies proposed her we intend to use plasmid DNA for the heavy chain of an antigenized antibody encoding for (NANP)3 to immunize mice and induce an anti-P. falciparum antibody response specific for the NANP peptide.  The studies are designed at verifying feasibility and empirically establishing a series of parameters such as specificity and titer of the antibody response, isotype of NANP-reactive antibodies, duration of the antibody response and priming effect on a subsequent immune response elecited by a protein antigen.  We are excited hy this new approach and hopeful that the ensemble of results that will be generated in the proposed work will constitute the permise for future and wider spectrum investigations on the potential use of antigenized antibody DNA immunization against malaria parasite in humans.",

There is a need for development of materials to record both permanent and reconfigurable holograms. Recently, polymeric photorefractive (PR) materials have evoked a lot of interest as inexpensive holographic media.  This Phase I project proposes to develop anew class of polymeric PR materials. The materials proposed are soluble polydiacetylenes (PDAs), known to exhibit large charge carrier mobilities and high photoconductivity. These polymers will be asymmetrically functionalized with second order nonlinear optical (NLO) chromophores and urethane containing flexible side groups. Polymer chains of these novel asymmetric PDAs self-assemble in an acentric stable polar organization leading to second order optical nonlinearities. High photoconductivity and large mobility, in conjunction with the NLO properties, would result in the fast PR response in these materials. These polymers will be synthesized and processed into thin films and bulk samples. Materials will be characterized for their optical properties, photoconductivity, and charge carrier mobility. PR measurements will be carried out to evaluate the PR responses of the materials. The polymeric PR materials would yield inexpensive and efficient holographic recording media. Such materials have applications in the areas of optical signal processing, optical data storage, and holographic optical interconnects. Also, such materials are suited for devices in industrial control and automation, based on real-time optical interferometry.",

These features have led to tremendous interest in the development of polymeric NLO materials for practical uses.  The specific goal of this research is to develop second-order NLO polymers for electro-optic devices.  This proposal focuses on design, synthesis and fabrication of NLO polymers with large second order optical nonlinearity, low optical loss, and long term stability of the NLO properties at elevated temperatures.  A new series of crosslinkable polimides containing tolane-based NLO chromophores is proposed.  The Tg and molecular weight of the soluble polimides can be controlled by adding proper amounts of end capping agent.  The chain end hydroxyl groups provide the opportunity for the polimide to form cross-lined networks by using an NLO active alkoxysilane dye as a crosslinking agent.  This system combines high Tg and crosslinked network characteristics to enchance the temporal stability.  Preliminary results in our laboratory indicate the expected stability in a poled\\crosslinked polyimide sample.  The detailed characterization of structure, property and the linear and NLO properties will be carried out.",

The technology consists of deterministic signal processing algorithms that fundamentally advance spectrum analyzer technology for extracting torsional vibration signals from operating turbines. Newly patented analytical methods for constant velocity power turbines will be generalized to accommodate the effects of acceleration in high performance aircraft turbines.  The resulting technology will continuously extract airfoil and rotor resonances and track their frequency shifts as a means to detect integrity-reducing structural changes in those engine components. The current project will also code the generalized method and test it with data collected during on-going, full-scale compressor tests, with the results being compared with strain gauge data.  The resulting technology will provide continuous resonance information for in-flight or ground-based use.

However, current experiences with automated mode selection have shown that there are significant difficulties with automation that can result in reduced situation awareness, increased workload, and cause \"automation surprise\". These problems have resulted in numerous mishaps and are believed responsible for several fatal crashes. It is expected that the problems currently observed in fixed wing aircraft will be exacerbated in helicopters using HMDs because, in contrast to fixed wing aircraft, the flight path and the direction of the aircrew's attention are often not aligned with the  helicopter's longitudinal axis.  This Phase I proposal addresses the issues of designing and developing improved mode switching for helicopter HMD symbology. This Phase I proposal goes beyond the feasibility analysis and promises to demonstrate automated display mode switching in a part-task flight simulation environment.",

Conformal thin films can also significantly reduce blind regions at the edge of the array. This effort will plan the architecture for the dual band monolithic IRFPA, determine the most promising materials for the two bands, provide a preliminary layout of the dual band unit cell, describe a preliminary process for fabricating the monolithic two color IRFPA, and plan and undertake critical material, detector and interconnect experiments.

New materials are required which can replace these alloys.  Safe tungsten alloys are being investigated as an alternative to uranium alloys.  The problem is that the ballistic performance of the tungsten alloys has not equaled that of the uranium alloys. However, it was recently reported that single-crystal tungsten has a superior penetration performance to tungsten alloys and an equivalent penetration performance to uranium alloys.  Current techniques for producing oriented polycrystalline tungsten alloys and single-crystal tungsten are not capable of economically supplying the dimensions and quantity needed by the DOD.  We propose to use a plasma Czochralski crystal growth technique to economically manufacture oriented polycrystalline tungsten alloy rods and singled-crystal tungsten rods up to 50 mm in diameter for use as kinetic energy penetrators.  This technique could also be used to make single-crystals of other materials which cannot be grown by currently available techniques.",

Specific applications of interest for the ceramic fasteners include high temperature joining regions of aircraft such as in the vicinity of engine exhaust, and also for use in the joining of aluminum airframe components to the galvanically dissimilar graphite fiber reinforced epoxy matrix composite panels. Existing titanium fasteners begin to lose stiffness and strength properties at temperatures as low as 2000F. Couples set up by the transmission of galvanic current from graphite/epoxy composites to metal components lead to degradation of the composites and corrosion of the metals. The use of coatings on the composite and sealants applied to the outside and mating surfaces of the metallic components has been demonstrated to be effective in reducing the galvanic action of the couples. This practice works successfully until a joint is reached, where a galvanic conduction path from the edge of the aluminum component to the edge of the composite is provided by the metal fasteners. Ceramic fasteners will be investigated as a potential solution to both of the technical problems posed by the use of the metal fasteners. This project will be performed with the engineering and technical assistance of Bell Helicopter and DuPont Lanxide, which will act as subcontractors to MSNW.",

Of the 250,000 to 300,000 plant species, only 5000 have been examined for medically useful compounds.  Agents discovered include cardioactive steroids, vasoactive compounds, antineoplastic agents, e.g., taxol, insecticides (pyrethrins), ribosome inactivating proteins (e.g., ricin), abortifacient proteins (Karasuring) and antifungal proteins (chitinases, glucanases and permatins).  However, many species producing useful pharmaceuticals are not crop plants and are not capable of being grown in large scale.  This necessitates the use of heterologous systems in order to obtain large quantities of the desired compound or protein.\n\nWe propose in this Phase I application to test the idea that the simple eukaryotic fungus, Neurospora crassa, can be used for the expression and production of plant proteins of high value using conventional submerged fermentation.  In this proposal, we will test the feasibility that chimeric DNA constructs containing the gene for an inducible, secreted N. crassa protein fused with Zsa mays gene coding for an antifungal protein, zeamatin, can be used to transform N. crassa and that transformants will express and secrete zeamatin when induced.",

        "abstract": "We propose to develop a novel and ambitious tool for large-scale development: a fourth-generation computer language (4GL) based upon an object-oriented generalization of the hierarchical block diagram paradigm, with powerful integrated simulation capabilities. Developers would assemble a prototype in a connect-the-blocks visual programming environment, test and evaluate it via simulation, then iteratively refine it until it is ready to be ported to the target environment. The simulation would then become a tool for training, trouble-shooting, and \"maintenance\", i.e. further iterative refinement. The connect-the-blocks approach facilitates system evolution and incremental integration. Previous tools have taken this same general approach, but have been successful in only a few narrow application domains, e.g. digital controls, circuit design, and signal processing, because they are too restrictive. Our tool would be enormously more flexible, extensible, and programmer-friendly, making it useful for any application domain. It would also serve well as the foundation for a variety of domain-specific tools, making it easy to use them in combination. The tool's simulation capabilities would also be useful outside the context of development per se, e.g. for constructing interactive virtual environments, and model-based decision making for autonomous systems. Such a tool is applicable through-out the public and private sectors in the design and analysis and implementation of large hardware and software systems. The tool will standardize and reduce the risks of such efforts.",

This simplified the functionality in the rocket payload.  Conventional GPS receivers has difficulty in acquiring and tracking the GPS satellite signals under the rocket boost phase dynamics and also are restricted form high altitude operations (>60,000 ft.). The TIDGET can provide reliable operation under dynamics an dover the full rocket trajectory through the use of the enhanced signal processing algorithms in the ground station.  This includes an innovative \"virtual IMU\" process which provides dynamic aiding to the TIDGET tracking process but requires only a single-axis, low cost (~$5) accelerometer to be included in the rocket payload.  The existing TIDGET sensor includes logic to interleave the accelerometer and met sensor data with the location data in telemetry downlink.

The principle effort will be to investigate the X-ray beam energy requirements to achieve satisfactory imaging of (i) prepreg materials after vacuum compression prior to molding, and (ii) composite structures after curing.  A preliminary examination will be made of images generated by a 10 micron X-ray source.  NDE based on X-ray transmission offers the opportunity to obtain precision real-time data on the condition of composite materials prior to use and immediately after molding or curing.

        "abstract": "There is an increasing need for innovative technologies that can destroy hazardous chemical wastes cost-effectively.  The ideal technology needs to be non-polluting, of low capital and operating costs and capable of producing useful products from the wastes. Destructive Absorption Technology (DAT) has been demonstrated to meet two of these needs: DAT is non-polluting and can produce useful products (fuels) from wastes.  However, DAT is expensive because the nanoscale powders of MgO and CaO that DAT uses as raw materials are expensive to produce.  For commercialization of DAT it is mandatory that a technology be developed that can produce nanoscale powders at low costs, ideally in the cents/lb range. Nanomaterials Research Corporation (NRC) seeks, in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to develop a process that can produce bulk quantities of DAT-powders economically.  NRC's technical approach is to synthesize nanopowders of MGo and CaO by continuously evaporating high vapor pressure precursors of the DAT-component and then forming nanoscale powders (expected size less than 5nm) in a forced convection stream.  The nanoscale powders will next be quenched and used in situ.  Phase I work will establish the proof-of-concept that high surface area DAT-nanopowders can be synthesized economically.  Phase II will build a prototype reactor, optimize its performance and field test the reactor.",

        "abstract": "There is an increasing need for an innovative technology for low cost remediation of chemical warfare agents and chemical wastes. Existing technologies such as bioremediation are not suitable for remediating chemical warfare agents because they are toxic to biological processes.  Furthermore, for chemical wastes of military and some commercial wastes such as surfactants, bioremediation is too slow and too expensive (requires a constant supply of nutrients, etc.).  An innovative alternative is photooxidation on semiconductor particles.  Photooxidation of chemicals on semiconductor catalyst is fast and works with solar energy. However, for solar irradiation-based photoremediation to become commercially viable, the process efficiency (quantum yield) of existing semiconductor particles needs to be significantly higher. To this purpose, Nanomaterials Research Corporation (NRC), in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, will develop nanocatalysts with significantly improved photocatalytic activity.  NRC's technical approach, during Phase I, is to investigate quantized nanoparticles of TiO(2) (Q-TiO(2)), with and without absorption-band broadening dyes, as photocatalysts.  During Phase II, NRC will design, assemble and test a photoreactor. Furthermore, NRC will initiate commercialization of the photoremediation technology based on quantized nanocatalysts during Phase II.",

Nanoscale powders can be made by a variety of methods but production scale, cost effective, environmentally sound methods are required. A supercritical C02 process is proposed for the synthesis of nanoscale zirconia (ZrO2) and yttria stabilized ZrO2 powders. During Phase II the process will be extended to non-oxides such as c-BN and TiN. Supercritical C02 is a novel solvent that enable precise control of primary crystallite size, aggregate size and distribution, and interface chemistry. The process will operate in a closed-loop configuration; C02 is abundant, environmentally benign, inexpensive ($ 0.05/lb.), and has reasonable critical parameters that enable this process to be economically scaled to produce large quantities of powder. Reactants will be introduced into the C02 feed stream. Nucleation and particle growth will be controlled by adjusting the reaction conditions Of C02. This process will benefit from increased polymerization kinetics at elevated temperatures and pressures. Powder interfaces will be controlled to prevent aggregate formation and powders will be collected by controlled expansion . Nanophase Technologies Corporation is a commercial producer of nanoscale powders by the GPC process and has made significant progress in superplastic net-shaping of nanophase ceramics.",

Destructive Absorption Technology (DAT) is a non-polluting treatment process that has demonstrated the capability of treating hazardous substances and allows for reclamation of valuable byproducts.  But currently, DAT performance is dependent upon the synthesis and use of ultrafine (nanoscale), highly reactive metal oxides such as CaO and MgO.  A supercritical CO(2) process is proposed for the synthesis of nanoscale CaO and MgO powders that have very high surface areas. Supercritical CO(2) is a novel solvent that enable precise control of primary crystallite size, aggregate size and distribution, and particle surface area.  The process will operate in a closed-loop configuration; CO(2) is abundant, environmentally benign, inexpensive ($ 0.05/lb.), and has reasonable critical parameters that enable this process to be economically scaled to produce large quantities of powder.  Commercial CaO or MgO will be solubolized in CO(2).  Nucleation, particle growth, and surface area will be determined by controlled expansion of the CO(2) solution.  Powder surface area will be correlated with destructive capacity using various stimulants and chlorinated solvents as substrates.

The application is for a passive missile warning receiver (MWR) system in a space based ballistic missile defense platform. The MWR system will use focal plane arrays to sense the plume radiation of approaching missiles. New types of polymer permit the extension of this technology to the mid infrared (MIR) range 2.0 to 4.8 microns. The new MIR fiber optic bundle will be flexible, highly stable and match the resolution requirements of a typical 256x256 element focal plane array detector. Success in this project will permit greater integration of multiple detectors for large angle coverage of MWR system, with the consequence of greater reliability and cost savings. The fiber bundle will permit thermography inside machinery and other difficult to access locations. The proposed technology will permit MIR medical diagnostic endoscopy for the first time. With use of narrow band filters, gas spectroscopy and industrial process control is another application of the proposed technology.",

        "abstract": "In future military and commercial communication infrastructures, there is a growing need to handle high density packaging problems, dispersion, losses and multireflections, associated with signal lines carrying short pulses. High temperature superconducting (HTS) thin film technology has reached a stage where it is now feasible to combine  HTS thin film passive components with various active and passive VLSI components to achieve greater integration and optimize performance, thereby overcoming some of the above mentioned problems. The Superconducting Non-reciprocal Multi Chip Module (SNMCM) proposed in this Phase I program is a compact multilayer sandwich incorporating HTS films for digital signal transport, ferrimagnetic films for non-reciprocal functionality and permanent magnetic films for fixed magnetic bias. It is expected that successful development of SNMCM would greatly benefit a broad range of electronic systems, spanning from military-secure communications to commercial wireless multimedia networks. Phase I of this SBIR has the goal to study the feasibility of an SNMCM by combining HTS and magnetic multilayer thin film technology with various active and passive components. We will undertake system-wide studies of future communications networks to assess the needs in term of inter-connectivity, packaging and system function. We will assess limitations and establish key manufacturing technologies for the different SNMCM layers which will form the basis for a subsequent Phase II effort. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: Successful development of an SNMCM would lead to advances in (1) Digital signal processors for heavy traffic multi-channel communications system - such as the current cellular and paging networks and future mobile sataellite pay loads, (2) Digital beam forming networks for phased array radars and multi-beam communications antennas, (3) Digital signal processors for wide band, multi-media transmissions involving digitally compressed video, data and voice channels for both commercial (such as the National Information Infrastructure) and battle field communications.",

An example of shallow water multipath dispersion is described using active acoustic sonobuoy data in shallow water. IBF active acoustic energy detection and signal replica correlation algorithms and methods of using IBF to enhance active sonar system performance are described. An IBF synthetic aperature technique is presented that is based on IBF matched field processing (IBF/MFP). Higher spatial resolution will be achieved when IBF is used over synthetic apertures.",

        "abstract": "The main challenge to generate virtual reality from the satellite and aerial imagery is the difficulty of reconstruction of 3D models in complex urban areas. one promising solution to the problem is the insertion of the 3D models of cultural features in the image data textured onto terrain elevation values. However, the necessity of extracting features manually in this method results in its failure to meet the automation requirement for the feature extrusion application. NETECH proposes a novel pattern recognition technique to automatically extract the features, therefore, the insertion of 3D models to the elevation data becomes feasible. Combining with a fast wavelet correlation method for stereo correspondence, the proposed approach can furnish the automatic feature extrusion with realistic appearances. The multiscale techniques and the parallel data structures of the underlying algorithms provide the advantages of utilizing multiple processors, which enables the system to significantly increase the throughput. During the Phase I effort, NETECH will prove the feasibility of the approach by prototype demonstration, which includes image registration, feature modeling, pattern recognition, stereo correspondence, and 3D scene rendering.",

        "abstract": "Until recently, digital transmission of high-quality images was limited to special high- bandwidth communication links, but even these kinds of channels cannot provide for real- time transmission of high-rate image sequences. Thus, a digital image sequence must be coded prior to transmission and storage. To remove the redundant information, which always exists in image sequences, most high rate image sequence compression techniques as required for some multi-media applications use 2D coding to achieve spatial compression and motion compensated difference coding in the time dimension. The advantages of the wavelet transform for static image analysis are well known and NETROLOGIC has developed very powerful wavelet as well as Fractal Stationary Image compression routines. We plan to investigate the nonlinear multiresolution analysis in the time dimension to be applied either before or after the cociiiig stage of 2D wavelet coefficients processing. This technique will be used to extract and code separately the 'edges\" and \"texture' components in time domain, in order to detect and compactly code the information on interframe changes accumulated in \"time edges\". The approach achieving the best performance will be selected for an advanced prototyping study in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "In response to AF95-135, we propose to determine the feasibility of enhancing the resolution of current excimer lithography systems by employing spatial filter and phase mask of novel designs.  The spatial filter (which is a diffractive optical element) will be specially designed for edge enhancement to improve on the high frequency contents of the images illuminating the photoresist and the resolution performance of the excimer lithography system.  The phase mask (which is another diffractive optical element) will be special designed for controlling the illumination direction of the mask (or reticle) in the excimer lithography system to achieve superresolution performance (or the performance of a larger effective aperture than the actual lens aperture).  These two approaches will result in low cost add-on accessories (with mechanism similar to reticle or color filter changers) readily insertable to the production lithography system, one for each system model.  They will overcome the disadvantage in the existing method of using phase shifting masks, which require custom design and fabrication specific to each integrated circuit; they will not require redesigning the lamp housing for illumination control.  To demonstrate the feasibility of resolution enhancement, NIPT will work closely with ANVIK to ensure that the designs and the fabricated spatial filter and phase mask will function properly in their excimer lithography systems.",

        "abstract": "We propose to develop a high compact, low cost, and high performance 3D volume holographic storage and retrieval system by employing novel opto-electronic devices. In this approach, the holographic medium - photorefractive crystal is spatially partitioned into a 3D grid of multiple holographic sub-volumes. In each sub-volume, multiple page-oriented holograms are superimposed by wavelength multiplexing. The advantages of the approach are compact design, i.e. suitable for system packaging and immune from air turbulence and system vibration; low cost, i.e. cheaper than semiconductor DRAM; and high performance, i.e. capacity larger than 10(11) bits/cm3, random access time faster than l us, throughput larger than lTbits/sec., and diffraction efficiency larger than 1%. The Market of optical storage are sizable (about $30 billion/year) and applications are numerous, including both military and commercial. The successful completion of this project in Phase I will provide a solid foundation for building a fully functioning prototype of compact information storage and retrieval system in Phase II and its commercialization in Phase III.",

        "abstract": "A packaged optoelectronic interconnection module consisting of at least 64 parallel interconnections between two stages of optoelectronic devices will be demonstrated in Phase I (including option).  The packaging technology to be employed for the demonstration will be highly compatible with the existing electronic packaging technology of multi-chip modules on printed circuit board (PCB).  Therefore, the resulting packaged interconnection module will be rugged, compact and low maintenance allowing field replacement to the overall assembly.  it will involve replace many high speed signal distribution layers in the PCB by one highly multimode waveguide (which can be called free space) in photopolymer, with recorded volume holograms to couple light from one smart pixel to another.  By adopting free-space optical interconnection technology, more interconnectivity (>256) among optoelectronic devices can be achieved, the layout of interconnections (e.g. for cross-over and fanout) will be simpler, and the design difficulties experienced by electrical interconnects at high frequency operations (e.g. transmission line impedance matching or termination) will be overcome.  The optoelectronic devices to be interconnected will either by GaAs FET-SEEDs (from AT&T) or VCSELs (from Honeywell) and photodetector arrays with HBT preamplifiers (from Rochwell).  In carrying out this demonstration project, NIPT, Inc. will work closely with Dr. Steve Hinterlong, Manager of the Photonic Switching Group at AT&T at Naperville, IL to ensure technical as well as future commercial viability.

The UFE uses a combination of existing World-Wide Web technology along with custom-written elements to present the user with an efficient, content-oriented data search.  The goal of the UFE is to allow data seekers to concentrate on the measurements they seek rather than on which NOAA database contains them.  A second goal of this work is to reduce loading on NOAA's databases and network connections as well as to minimize the modifications required to put those databases on-line.  A third goal is to improve data access for users with low-bandwidth Internet connections.\n\nThe proposed solution includes a \"state engine\" to remember prior user requests.  The user is therefore not required to repeatedly enter the same search parameters during an iterative data request.  By implementing the state engine at the UFE level, the interface with individual databases is simplified.  This overcomes a major impediment of applying WWW technology to database access.  \n\nThe proposed solution also includes a real-time bandwidth-sensing feature to optimize the transfer mode for the output data set.",

        "abstract": "The exponential growth in information technology has led to a commensurate explosion in data transfer requirements.  Satellite transmission presents a unique set of challenges since the links need to satisfy this burgeoning demand 10 years after launch.  The new satellite generation must maintain compatibility with the preceding constellation in order to maintain coverage and crosslink interconnectivity.  Transponder power consumption limitations preclude the high order QAM modulations that have become prevalent for terrestrial modems. Satellite transponder power amplifiers achieve their highest efficiency when they are driven into compression, requiring a modulation that is essentially constant envelop, yet fits within a narrow channel.  The Crosslink Hyper Speed Multimode Modem (CHM3) sets the course to obtaining data rates of 10Gbps while satisfying the unique bandwidth and power constraints of satellite links.  Crosslinks with existing on orbit satellites are maintained by selecting an architecture that shifts modulation formats on-the-fly, enabling a graceful transition to the next generation communications package. Channel latency is dramatically diminished by incorporating block phase estimation to accelerate acquisition when switching between modes.  The Phase I effort includes a thorough evaluation of the proposed techniques and culminates in an ASIC specification for a fully compliant 50Mbps modem.",

The problem with this approach is the massive data storage requirement that is required.  Because of our involvement with the Bradley program we have been able to assess what is available in physical storage device technology as well as the state of video and sound compressing techniques.  We found that the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is the recognized leader in this software technology.  They have developed methodologies in connection with their weapons work that have direct application to the Army data compression problem.  Because of this and because  the Government is encouraging the transfer of defense related technology to industry, Nova has arranged for the support of LLNL on this project. LLNL will make available the use of some of their data compression algorithms for which commercial licenses are being developed.  LLNL will work with Nova under a funded Cooperative Research and Development Agreement.

        "abstract": "In general, the wavelength acceptance of most non-linear optical crystal suitable for second harmonic-generation (SHG) is much larger than the linewidth of a single frequency laser. However, for low coherence sources, like many diode lasers which have relative large spectral bandwidths, the wavelength acceptance becomes an important issue. LiB305 (LBO) is proposed as the most suitable material for the frequency upconversion of diode lasers because it can accept a much wider spectral bandwidth (few nanometers) for SHG required phase matching than either LiNbO3 or KTiOP04. Additionally, Type I SHG phase matching in the XY plane, and noncritical phase matching of LBO are preferred for SHG in a waveguide structure. However, no thin film growth of LBO has yet reported. Therefore, in Phase I, we propose to develop a metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) to grow the world's first thin films of LBO and process them for fabrication of waveguide structures. The success in Phase I will lead to the further development of integrated short wavelength (",

        "abstract": "This proposal addresses the fabrication of a novel uncooled pyroelectric IR detector array having significant spectrum coverage (from UV to far IR), size, weight, and cost advantages over the current ones. The innovation is based on the utilization of pyroelectric thin films of high figures of merits and monolithic integration technology. The proposed thin film membrane device structure allows the optimum IR detector array design. A substantial reduction in fabrication cost is anticipated from the elimination of both wafer thinning and solder bump bonding associated with the current state-of-art. This technology development is particularly suited to meet the applications that require broader spectrum coverage, smaller weight and size, higher resolution and sensitivity, lower power consumption, and higher reliability. This Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach by an initial growth of new pyroelectric films of PbScl/2Tal/2O3 on Si via an innovative low temperature plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD) process. The PE-CVD may become the best choice to produce large IR detector arrays in sufficient qualities and at low enough cost to facilitate widespread use of infrared sensing systems. In Phase II prototype devices will be produced. Success in the Phase I effort will identify a viable manufacturing route for advanced uncooled IR imaging array fabrication. These devices have a wide range of \"dual use\" applications, from various DoD's space-based applications to commercial applications of fire fighting, law enforcement, industrial control, and drivers aid.",

        "abstract": "The use of silicon as the supporting template for nitride growth offers obvious advantages in terms of low cost and the prospects for integration of photonic devices with the mature silicon technology.  However, GaN has a large lattice mismatch with respect to Si while SiC is closely lattice matched to GaN.  Thus we propose an approach for growing very high quality single crystal films of SiC on Si which will solve the nitride substrate problem by providing an excellent silicon-based substrate for GaN deposition.  Our approach will keep the lattice points for the SiC layer coherent with the silicon substrate (no kinks); thus all of the dislocations will remain in the plane of the junction, passing out of the material at the edges of the wafer.  We rely on a non-thermodynamic equilibrium growth technique, supersonic jet epitaxy, that can supply kinetic energy for growth at low temperatures where lattice relaxation cannot readily occur, and a compliant substrate which will relieve the stress by generating dislocation in a thin layer of Si on Sio  2  before the SiC film can relax. Phase I will concentrate on substrate preparation and parameters for depositing highly perfect SiC films at low temperatures.  An optional task will explore the effect of alternate substrate orientations.  Phase II will concentrate on optimizing the compliant substrates and developing high performance nitride devices on them.",

Although \"porous silicon\" produced by electrochemical etching shows bright visible photoluminescence, electroluminescence intensities remain poor due t enormous defect densities. Our QWR structures will have high crystalline perfection, allowing bright electroluminescence to be manifested.

Cladding layers will be grown on specially cleaned silicon substrates, using (unique procedure developed at the University of Florida; the silicon films will be deposited at low temperatures thereon. Phase I will specify growth conditions to form silicon quantum wires, and to demonstrate strong, blue-shifted photoluminescence. In Phase II we shall prepare junction diodes which emit near-visible light under electrical bias. Because the QWRs will be configured as waveguides, we anticipate subsequent demonstration of arrays of silicon diode.

The new GMR complex-oxides hold the potential for overcoming the drawbacks of artificial GMR multilayer materials. Currently, the key to using GMR oxide films in magnetic sensors is the improvement in their field sensitivity. We have conducted the thin film growth of new GMR oxides and demonstrated the highest field sensitivity at room temperature reported to date. Our study indicates that the sensitivity could be significantly improved by reducing carrier scattering at the phase transition. Phase I will further improve the field sensitivity of GMR oxide films meeting the practical read head requirement via the epitaxial growth of high structural perfection single-crystalline films by an innovative plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD) process. The PE-CVD is suitable for practical manufacturing. Phase II would anticipate prototype demonstrations. It is anticipated that the high performance GMR magnetic sensor technology will have wide applications in both DoD and commercial systems.

        "abstract": "Existing mid-frequency (MP) hull-mounted active sonars can be used for high resolution imaging of submarines and small objects in shallow water (SW) by combining synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) technology with matched field processing (MFP).  SAS increases the overall sonar system aperture (from the existing sonar size) to the ship's length (or longer), thereby improving the azimuthal resolution.  MFP provides a means to coherently focus both target and clutter returns.  Transmit waveforms, transmission parameters and the processing algorithms will be defined, and a follow-on plan for a MF-based sea test will be developed.  This approach offers an economical way to significantly improve existing sonar systems because it requires strap-on signal processing hardware without modification to the sonar array.  We estimate for a nominal 3 kHz MP bow-mounted sonar, SAS-MFP based resolutions of 0.15 m (6 inches) cross-range, 0.30 m (12 inches) slant-range, and 0.95 z (37 inches) depth can be achieved out to 3 km range and up to a 10 knot platform speed.  This results in a two-sided mapping rate of up to 108 square kilometers per hour.",

In practice, it has proved difficult to produce a large number of lamellae of correct thickness, orientation and optical quality for operational devices. We propose a novel bonding technique of individual lamellae for the fabrication of InP quasi-phase matched stacks. Potential features of the process include interfaces of low loss without altering the nonlinear optical properties of the bulk. The stacks will be characterized by transmission measurements and frequency conversion efficiency. The process will also be applicable to other nonlinear optical semiconductor crystals, e.g. GaAs, GaP, GaSb, ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe and CdTe. Frequency conversion by QPM stacks of semiconductor crystals in the IR may be applied to spectroscopy, remote sensing and LIDAR, monitoring the Earth's atmosphere from satellites to acquire meteorological and environmental data.",

The Phase I prototype will continuously output all 6 components of projectile orientation (latitude, longitude, geometric altitude, roll, pitch, and yaw) at a digital 120 Hz rate.  From time sequences of these parameters we also compute ground-speed and heading.  Because of our existing aircraft test platform, previous experience in military aircraft instrumentation, and use of low-cost off-the-shelf components, we are able to configure and preliminary flight test such a prototype system with 1000 G shock resistance in the Phase I effort.  Phase II will consist of refinements, cost-effectiveness studies, MIL-SPEC testing, sensor integration with flight control systems, software development to optimally integrate GPS and inertial reference (gyroscopic) data, enhanced G-load tolerance, quicker GPS acquisition, and repackaging for military projectile and/or cruise missile test evaluations.",

        "abstract": "Missile defense systems for battle management require dense computing for several extremely complex simultaneous information processing requirements. The computation architecture must be highly flexible and rapidly reconfigurable. OPTELECOM, Inc. offers to develop a proprietary optical switch concept for use in BMDO applications. The basic switch element is an in-fiber grating whose reflection spectrum is shifted momentarily by the action of a focused acoustic wave. A switched optical carrier frequency selective optical tap is produced by using the switch as an element within an all fiber Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The OPTELECOM switch is superior to present day optical switches by virtue of lower insertion loss, optical frequency selectivity, rugged construction and potential for reduced cost. The switch enables use of a given optical fiber grid by many independent signals without interference or relative timing constraints. Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and other packet data switching protocols are readily supported by systems using the OPTELECOM switch.  Proposed Phase I work is design of critical experiments to characterize the OPTELECOM switch and definition of functional elements which will provide the maximum stimulus within BMDO optical computing and optical signal processing programs. Phase I effort also includes development of a Phase II program plan for functional element demonstrations. Successful completion of the proposed optical data interconnect investigation will identify and characterize an important component for future dense computing systems. The proposed component, and computing architectures enabled by unique component features, will significantly advance United States information infrastructure capabilities for both military and commercial applications.",

These latter mirrors have excellent reflectivity down to 560 nm. Wafer fusion allows us to replace an absorbing GaAs substrate with a transparent GaP substrate.

The matching of lattice constants, thermal expansion coefficients and energy bands, as well as chemical compatibility, provide a strong incentive to use native substrates. Classical growth methods all suffer from problems; in some cases, quality is high but cost, resistivity and fragility are also high. Melt growth is used for all other high volume semiconductors, presumably because the high rate of growth leads to reasonable cost. However, ZnSe has a phase transition close to the melting point. Thus, we propose a slightly lower temperature growth process that combines the speed and composition versatility of melt growth with the features of other low temperature processes. Early results have shown that significant volumes of twin-free ZnSe can be grown. Conductivity without annealing has also been seen. We expect that this process will be capable of meeting the Phase II goal of high n-type doping densities.",

The proposed volume memory array will be integrated into the high perfromance optical computing (HPOC) module program currently under development by Rome Labortory, ARPA, ONR, and BMDO.

The insertion of volume photorefractive optical interconnect element (V-POIE) technology will provide wavelenght selective interconnect reconfigurability at system clock speeds (or faster).  Target switching speeds of 1 ns may be achieved by electrical tuning of multisection distributed Bragg reflection (DBF) edge or a vartical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) diode.

Conventional IR seeker optics are often heavy, bulky, costly and have other performance, packaging, and related problems.  This SBIR will develop a new class of high performance low f/number IR imaging seeker optics for the MWIR and/or LWIR for these new FPAs.  The optics will be compact, high performance, and low in cost.  The design concepts will assure a 100% cold stop efficiency for maximum sensitivity and freedom from image anomalies.  Several unique and innovative approaches will be optimized and thoroughly evaluated including refractive and reflective optics using aspheric as well as diffractive surfaces.  A key concept to be used is that of the reflective warm stop which will aid significantly in meeting these demanding system requirements. Fabrication and producibility issues as well as athermalization will be given a high priority.  While not addressed in the solicitation, athermalization can often be the single most significant problem in IR seeker optics development.  If considered early in the system engineering and development, it can be kept under control, and athermalization will be given a suitably high priority in this design effort.",

We propose to develop a simple stratospheric temperature sounder, based on a Fabry-Perot interferometer used as a Multi-Order Etalon Sounder (MOES), measuring the emission spectrum of CO2. MOES uses the regularly spaced FPI instrument function to map a similar portion of each line onto a single detector.  The addition of a kaleidoscope and cone allows the entire lineshape spectrum from several spectral lines to be recorded at one point in time by a linear array detector. Preliminary calculations show portions of the 4.3 um band of CO2 to be acceptable for an instrument resolution near 0.01 cm-1. Fluorescent emission of very narrow halfwidth at line center will have an effect on temperature retrieval using this band at the higher altitudes, but these effects can be accounted for by the combination of a deconvolution technique and a quantitative model. During Phase I, the proof-of-principle experiment and the MOES instrument will be designed.  The instrument itself can be built and perhaps even flown in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Detailed models of limited aspects of vehicle performance are currently used in engineering development, e.g., DADDS, BRL-CAD/SQUASH, PRISM, etc.  There is a need for an integrated model which analyzes the interactions among subsystems and evaluates performance of multiple system functions.  Design decisions which make sense in isolation can turn out to be detrimental in the integrated system operational context.  This proposal is to develop a \"macro-model\" for design tradeoffs, feasibility analysis, and design optimization.  It models subsystems and their interactions using simplified models of subsystem performance linked back to detailed analytic simulations and test data via calibration databases.  It uses a single, common description of the design concept for all system functions and design constraints.  The \"ripple effects\" of a design change will immediately be seen in all affected functions.  The model will be embedded in an interative optimization wrapper which will identify conflicts among the performance objectives and design constraints.  The proposed Phase I effort will deliver specifications for the full-scope Ground Vehicle System Integration and Design Optimization Model, and will implement and demonstrate a fully-functional but limited-scope prototype.",

This proposal addresses the problem of providing such a connection with free-space optics and smart-pixel optoelectronic devices.  Free-space optics is uniquely suited to implementing this connection because it:  (1) requires no physical connection between the focal plane and the outside electronics, leading to simple assembly and low heat loss; (2) has the lowest optical losses of any connection technique; (3) minimizes the number of components at cryogenic temperatures; and (4) can be scaled to higher bandwidth applications.  Smart-pixel devices combine arrays of optoelectronic modulators with signal processing electronics using monolithic or hybrid integration on a common substrate.  The goal is to develop a free-space link to move data from a cooled focal plane to an ambient temperature electronic output will less heat loss than existing electronic or fiber interconnects.  In Phase I, we will determine suitable optical components, evaluate transmitter and receiver designs, and determine the best combination of devices to maximize data transfer rate, parallelism and robustness while minimizing cryogenic heat load, alignment and packaging problems.  We will develop a thorough preliminary design for a complete link, evaluate its performance, power dissipation and cost, identify technical challenges to implementing the free-space focal plane interconnect to be constructed in prototype form in Phase II.",

Conventional electromechanical fiber optic switches are commercially available and exhibit low insertion loss, but are not sufficiently rugged, compact, integratable, or low-cost for many applications.  Fiber-optic switches based on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology have the potential to achieve very low cost in compact, rugged packages, and are well-suited to integration to implement arrays of switches and more complex switches.  In this document, Optivision (acting as prime contractor) and Texas Instruments (TI, acting as a subcontractor) propose the development of MEMS fiber-optic switches using TI's digital micromirror device (DMD) technology and Optivision's fiber-optic packaging expertise.  We will: (1) Investigate DMD designs with adequate pixel size and deflection angle for single mode and multimode MEMS fiber-optic switches, (2) investigate packaged switch architectures for 1x2, W, and 1xN switches, (3) investigate MEMS package components and implementations, (4) demonstrate operation of a MEMS fiber-optic switch in the laboratory, (5) identify a Navy program customer for the Phase II MEMS switch, and (6) perform a high-level design for a switch to be built during the Phase II effort.

New applications are developing for hyperspectral sensors in the area of environmental monitoring.  The combination of imaging with spectroscopy allows their data to be tied to maps and geographical information systems and, by use of global positioning system (GPS), report in real-time on the exact location and extent of events of interest.  This capability is of particular importance in emergency response, toxic cloud tracking, oil spill detection, and more.  OKSI is currently developing the first staring hyperspectral imaging sensor (TIRIS) that operates in passive mode in the long wave infrared portion of the spectrum for use in such applications.  The development of chemometric techniques that are geared for operations with such a sensor will open the road for major advances in remote sensing and chemical detection.  Under Phase I OKSI will develop novel algorithmic paradigms that are based on deterministic transform-domain analysis of spectral signatures, and utilize spatial information to obtain signal statistics.  These techniques were originally developed for target and countermeasure discrimination and their application to chemical detection will be explored.",

Application of these techniques is not limited to photoconductive switches, however, and can provide a powerful tool for the research and development phase of semiconductor device development, as well as on-line inspection. Currently, the design, manufacture, and troubleshooting of modern, high-performance semiconductor devices and integrated circuits relies almost entirely upon electrical measurements made to the device's external electrical contacts.  Internal characteristics must be inferred from these limited measurements.  The use of optical imaging techniques allows direct measurement of these critical parameters over the entire circuit.  Optometrix has assembled the team of scientists and engineers responsible for the initial efforts in this area in order to bring these methods to the general semiconductor industry.

Presently a number of commercial enterprises have developed haptic interface hardware products, but there is no vendor of haptic rendering software to support these devices.  The Mirage project will use a state of the art haptic rendering technique, the constraint-based god-object method, to develop a software environment to support currently available haptic interfaces.  The god-object method is the first which allows users of haptic interfaces to touch arbitrary three dimensional objects.  This generality will be necessary to support the scope of applications researchers have already identified for haptic interfaces.  Mirage's real-time software architecture will allow application specialists to apply haptic interface technology without being experts in the field.  In addition, its object-oriented nature will allow future haptic researchers to easily develop individual components of the haptic renderer.",

Hybrid systems that make use of acoustic and nonacoustic sensors, artificial intelligence (Al), and advanced multisensor fusion technologies are required to provide improved detection and classification performance. To achieve this goal, a design study will be conducted during Phase I of this SBIR contract. Three objectives will be satisfied during the design study phase: first, acoustic and nonacoustic sensor technologies will be Identified and characterized (i.e., report timeliness coverage, etc.) to determine mission applicability; next, hybrid neural network and AI applications will be defined to provide automated detection, classification, and localization estimates to an operationally proven multihypothesis fusion algorithm; finally, the multihypothesis fusion algorithm will be modified to provide final classification and localization estimates using sensor-level detection data from dissimilar types of sensors.

        "abstract": "ORINCON proposes to develop a multiple-sensor fusion system to locate bulk subsurface contaminants.  Typical contaminats are comprised of fuels and chlorinated solvents that lie on top (LNAPL) or bottom (DNAPL) of an aquifer, and slowly diffuse into groundwater.  The use of a particular geophysical technique/sensor primarily depends on the contaminat of interest, geology of the survey area, and possible interference from surrounding objects. The most promising approach is to use a variety of sensors to measure different physical parameters and to independently integrate each sensor's information to provide data interpretations that are not attainable by a single technique or sensor.  ORINCON is proposing the development of a system that integrates image processing, morphology techniques, and multiple-sensor data fusion techniques to robustly define the extent of conteminated deposits. The fusion system will characterize and image LNAPL and DNAPL deposit boundaries by physical parameters as measured by multiply senors. A two-dimensional image of the sensor information is constructed where the intensities of the image represent the measured physical parameter values.  Boundary information form multiple sensors will be fused to refine the final automatic target boundary location for the given depth z o.  Contamination boudaries can similarly be defined for various depths z j by taking sensor measurements along a bore hole placed by a cone penetrometer.",

Better thermal dissipation can be achieved with the use of insulated metal boards at a fraction of the cost. Despite this, the high thermal conductivity of the metal substrate has not been taken full advantage of in copper-clad metal substrates because of thermal resistance of the adhesion layer which is used to bond the circuitry. Additionally multi-layer circuitry was not possible until now on metal substrates. The development of an insulated metal substrate with directly deposited conductive traces using electrically conductive inks based on transient liquid phase sintering technology is proposed. High temperature operation, low cost, light weight and the ability to print directly onto metallic substrates are properties that give these conductive inks unique advantages. Thermally conductive metal substrates could take advantage of this technology to achieve high thermal dissipation. Thermally resistive adhesive interfaces would be eliminated, resulting in higher thermal dissipation and higher product reliability. It is anticipated that high temperature circuits fabricated will exhibit superior resistance to thermal and environmental degradation. Anticipates the development of a low cost, high thermal dissipation insulated metal substrate technology. This technology will utilize simple, additive processing of stable conductive ink materials to build reliable multi-layer circuitry.",

First, to perform feature extraction over the entirety of an image in real time, we  propose to develop a high resolution, pin-compatible, 2-D, CCD image sensor with integrated electro-optic, feature-extraction neural network.  This small, rugged device will couple a novel, miniature, \"distributed optical device\" of our design and manufacture to a commercially available image sensor.  This modified sensor will plug into the image sensor socket in a video camera and, using the massive parallelism of optics, extract features over the entirety of scenes that are imaged upon it.  Second, to increase flexibility and perform neural network and signal processing operations in time and space n real time over the extracted features that are output from the sensor, we propose to develop algorithms that run on our A236 Parallel Signal Processor Module.

This laser radar system will measure local wind conditions, detect wind sheers along the glide slope, and measure deck positions, aspect and motion.  This information will be processed and integrated into the existing automatic Carrier Landing System (ACLS) to provide instantaneous flight control correction during carrier landing.  Through the existing ACLS interface, the laser radar data could be sued for improved \"hands off\" landing operation or to modify existing pilot landing cues (meedles).  PSR's approach is to use an existing aircraft optical aperture for the laser radar's transceiver and off-the-shelp processign and laser technology, with the potential of using fiber optics so that the laser radar transmitter, receiver and/or processor can be remotely located within the aircraft.  This also offers the crucial advantage of accessing existing laser assets (transmitters, processors, etc.) for landing support functions.  This technological approach is compatible with installation of a wide variety of aircraft and should significantly enhance safety of carrier deck operations.",

Both classical PR and neural network (NN) approaches will be investigated.  Innovative approaches to the data classification problem are outlined in this proposal, and a testing/verification methodology is also presented.

        "abstract": "While there has been a great investment by the Government in all types of infrared focal plane arrays (FPAs) over the past several years, there has been little direct investment in innovative imaging systems to mate with these FPAs.  For the most part, classical imaging solutions have been applied to this optical imaging problem with a certain level of success.  However, the latest generation of focal planes utilize a unit cell size which is driving a demand for very fast (low f/number) imaging objectives. Clearly, more innovative imaging solutions must be found.  This proposal demonstrates how advances in optical design, coating, and fabrication technology can be brought together to design hybrid refractive/diffractive systems which can keep pace with both uncooled and cooled focal plane technology.  Here two novel objective forms are introduced:  (i) the AMOS (Athermal Multiple Order Imaging System) imaging concept and (ii) the ACIS (Athermal Catadioptic Imaging System) imaging concepts.  Both concepts utilize hybrid refractive/diffractive components and can be used for either uncooled or cooled focal plane array. Both AMOS and ACIS type systems allow for ultra wideband imaging at very low f/numbers.  In addition, the configurations offer a reduced element count making them more manufacturable at a lower cost.",

In Phase I we will prove the feasibility of the reliable capillary pump by (1) proof-of-concept experiments that demonstrate operation of the key CPL component, (2) fabrication experiments that demonstrate the feasibility of economically producing the capillary pump, (3) conceptual design of a CPL, and (4) analysis of CPL performance to quantify the expected benefits.",

The compressor is a critical component in a low capacity, vibration free, long life cryocooler.  Key features of the development include the incorporation of a permanent magnet in a miniature high speed shaft, and a unique and simple control system to synchronize the motor at its optimum efficiency point.  This motor concept promises a major increase in efficiency over existing miniature induction motors.  The increase in efficiency will, for the first time, enable the use of turbomachine-based cryocoolers in spaceborne applications where input power to the system is limited to about 100 W and where cooling requirements are in the range of 0.5 W - 2 W at temperatures between 35 K and 100 K.  Phase I consists of proof-of-concept demonstration of the permanent magnet motor.  In Phase II, prototype compressor will be designed, fabricated, and tested in reverse-Brayton cryocooler.",

We propose an innovative and simplified thermodynamic cycle, based upon the enthalpy flux heat-lifting principle of the OPTR, with potential benefits in reliability weight, and manufacturing cost. The Phase I project objective is to prove the principle of operation in breadboard hardware and to empirically define sensitivity of performance to design parameters. The Phase I effort includes breadboard apparatus construction, testing, data analysis, and documentation. Anticipated benefits include substantial reductions in cost for highly reliable mechanical refrigerators and heat pumps for extended mission spacecraft applications. The innovation has broad potential commercial application for compact and light-weight, low-cost cryogenic cooling of HTS components in telecommunications systems, high-density electronic systems, and medical instrumentation.",

        "abstract": "The use of robot technology in many military and private sector applications has been limited due to the application-specific nature of available robot hardware and control software.  the use of robots with multiple sensors, kinematic redundancy, and mobile bases has been restricted because of the lack of a a flexible means to develop robust control algorithms for positioning, interaction forces, and high level tasks.  We propose to develop an object- oriented, robot control and development environment (OORCDE) which provides a method for rapid prototype testing of novel robot hardware configurations and task requirements.  The OORCDE provides tools that use descriptions of the robot hardware (sensors, actuators, and physical parameters) and the desired tasks to generate control algorithms which may subsequently be directly loaded into target processors to implement closed-loop control. The feasibility of the proposed concept will be established during Phase I by a demonstration of the methodology and by completing the preliminary design of the object-oriented modules and software, and simulating an illustrative example.  In Phase II, a full scale system will be designed, assembled, and tested using existing sensor-based, mobile robot test beds.",

This research takes a systematic approach to identifying, measuring, and validating a wider range of retention-relevant variables than has been studied before.  The scientific focus is on a retention model that will identify effects of various practical variables on training retention. The practical focus is on a computerized procedure that will allow training practitioners to input key aspects of the training situation and learn the optimal means of training as well as the practical effects of various training decisions.  This implementation of the retention model represents an important step in bridging the gap between science and practice. The model will be identified by a literature review on skill retention and models of skilled performance.  We will then develop and refine a means of measuring these variables in a Inventory of Task and Instructional Characteristics (ITIC), with different versions for administration to task experts, training personnel, and trainees.  Phase I will also include development of a prototype computer module to demonstrate the decision-making procedure.  We will also refine a plan for Phase II validation of the ITIC and completion of the computerized procedure.",

        "abstract": "We propose to study, formulate and assess the concept of a Virtual Test Range (VTR).  A virtual test range, and its close relative the Virtual Training Range, allow live and simulated vehicles and troops to interoperate in the same exercise.  Live vehicles and soldiers are instrumented to allow them to see into, and themselves to be seen in, a virtual battlefield which correlates to the actual terrain.  VTR allows conventional vehicles to emulate experimental ones.  VTR also allows a few live vehicles to be augmented with simulated forces to form complete BLUFOR and OPFOR units.  Because of the expense of fidelity and concerns regarding validation, emulated live vehicles lower cost and allow better testing over that of simulator-only methods.  Because of environmental damage restrictions, OPTEMPO reductions, and safety considerations, fewer live vehicles lower cost and allow increased training over that of field-only methods.  Previous demonstrations have shown that VTR is possible, in principle.  We propose here to establish the necessary system requirements, architecture, and technical basis for assessing the feasibility of the complete VTR concept based on actual user community needs.  Newer technologies will be investigated to lower instrumentation cost and to allow simulated targets to be merged with real out-the-window views.  Our ultimate goal for Phase I is to demonstrate the VTR concept in a functional mobile breadboard.",

        "abstract": "The Perrigo Technology, Inc. team proposes an innovative, multi- discipline research program to develop a rapid repair system by integrating emerging corrosion control technology with many recent developments in the use of steel components to strengthen concrete structures.  The proposed repair system consists of prefabricated \"steel component modules\" suitable for various common repair scenarios, supplemented by a combination of protective coatings, cathodic protection, proper corrosion design configurations and procedures to minimize material degradation during transportation, storage and installation.  The proposed repair methods combine corrosion control advances with recent innovative structural and construction engineering developments in the following areas: 1) the use of steel plates to strengthen concrete members, 2) the steel/concrete composite construction, and 3) various pile replacement retrofit methods with steel pipe piles.  The repair system will be designed for easy transportation, storage, and installation.  It also will be suited for rapid repairs in emergency conditions where it is necessary to ensure continuous port operation.  Based on extensive previous studies and field-proven methods, the proposed research has a great potential for significant early return on the investment by reducing repair costs.",

        "abstract": "The Surface Discharge (SD) is an electrically driven impulsive acoustic source with a broadband low frequency spectrum. In comparison to an explosive acoustic source the SD is safe, reusable, can provide pulse trains and has controllable acoustic output. The originator of the Surface Discharge acoustic source proposes to evaluate the use of SD technology for \"A1\" size sonobuoy applications. Existing SD acoustic source technology, developed for surveillance arrays, has novel features attractive for use in sonobuoys. The SD has high efficiency in converting electrical into acoustic energy and a compact transducer design that translate into a powerful impulsive acoustic source with the potential to supplement or replace explosive acoustic sources currently in use. Controllability includes both the ability to determine the peak in the acoustic spectrum as well as precise electronic timing of pressure waveforms. Unlike explosives, an SD system can ping many times, and will eliminate the safety and environmental concerns of explosives. Phoenix Science & Technology (PS&T) proposes to apply its unique knowledge of low frequency impulsive SD sources in a design study to determine the SD's Energy Source Level (ESL) and acoustic spectral capabilities in an \"A\" size sonobuoy, in comparison to a four pound SUS charge. We will trade-off the maximum ESL as a function of number of pings and ping repetition rate, and use existing experimental data to determine the timing accuracy capability for producing programmable wavetrains. In addition, we will design single and 3 element SD systems for fabrication and testing in Phase II.",

We propose here the development of a novel two dimensional acousto-optic processor for real-time multifunction signal processing including correlation, convolution, spectral analysis, and ambiguity and Wigner function calculation.  Applications for the pro- cessor include pulse-Doppler radar processing, target recognition using synthetic aperture radar processing, and communication and electronic warfare signal processing.  The optical design of the processor is based on a newly invented optically efficient, in-line, high stability, two dimensional interferometer using four acousto-optic devices.  Via the simple technique of Bragg cell carrier offset adjustments, the processor can generate the desired high dynamic range interferometric output on a chosen spatial carrier that is required for bias removal and electronic post-processing.  The proper choice of Bragg cells is key to realizing a wideband, robust, multifunction processor.",

This dispersion compensated binary optics technology will then be applied to a novel optical imaging technique that allows objects to be seen through turbid media such as turbulence, fog, smoke, or water. In Phase I, a computer-aided design tool will be developed for the proposed dispersion-compensated binary optics technology and a proof-of-principle experiment will be carried out.

The many advantages of the proposed concept include: a new WDM component, based on a mature waveguide WDM geometry; low material and fabrication costs; low insertion losses; small wavelength channel separation (- 1 nm, satisfying network demands); more than 20 channels (potential for more than 78 channels); compact device structure, and; ease of packaging with laser and detector arrays. The goal of Phase I is to demonstrate the feasibility of a low cost polyimide waveguide WDM. Phase II will produce an optimized device along with the development of multi-wavelength transmitters and receivers for network applications. Hybrid packaging with developed multi-wavelength laser arrays and photodector arrays will lead to multi-wavelength transmitters and receivers.

The uniqueness of these signatures is evidenced by massive information volumes containing their spectral signatures. For a 10-bit dynamic range, this can exceed 103 to 103 power. To provide high-dynamic range spectral signature recognition, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes a high-dynamic-range Multi-Band miniaturized Spectral (MBS) sensor system.

The proposed spectral sensing hardware is retrofittable to, and cooperates within general multi-spectral fusion schemes such as: conventional imaging and night vision, SONAR, and RADAR.

When a high-power waveguide is installed in a corrosive environment, joints in the waveguide often deteriorate and gaps develop that lead to arcing and to dangerously high voltage standing wave ratios (VSWRs) in the waveguide.  Additionally, arcs can form in waveguides where dust or small metal chips are present. The proposed sensor consists of a fluorescent optical fiber lying along the corner of a waveguide.  When arcing occurs in the waveguide, the fiber fluoresces brightly.  Much of this fluorescence is guided by the fiber to detection optoelectronics located outside the waveguide.  The optical signal can be used to shut down the microwave transmitter and prevent further damage to the components.  In addition, a novel scheme allows the proposed sensor to accurately determine the location of the arcing so that dismantling a large portion of the waveguide can be avoided.  This optical system will have no effect on waveguide transmission properties, and should be both more reliable and less expensive than acoustical detection techniques.",

Sensitive magnetometers are valuable tools for detecting underground deposits of natural resources, volcanic activity or motion of underground lava flows, hidden underground production facilities, anomalous power line behavior, and for antennas in specific low frequency communications bands.  In Phase I, PSI will demonstrate the optical pumping techniques, light detection techniques, RF tuning techniques, optimize the bench top instrument sensitivity, then demonstrate the vibration insensitivity of the bench top instrument.

Our method eliminates the need for extraction and concentration procedures and it employs inexpensive and proven technology. Unlike techniques in which atomic emission is monitored, our approach is insensitive to interferences from other metals.  Our method is thus appropriate for instrumentation monitoring airborne metals particularly during site remediation where particulate bearing metals can be raised.  The resulting instrumentation will be capable of operating continuously for long periods of time.  The particle processing procedure is efficient and can be operated with battery power, thus providing a system that can be portable and field operable.  In this Phase I effort, we will establish the feasibility of the proposed approach with calibrated dry aerosols containing lead. Detection limits will be deduced and a benchtop apparatus will be calibrated.  We will also employ the key technology behind the method to build a new atomic emission line source.  The developmental issues identified in this effort will allow the building and demonstration of a field-worthy prototype in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Destructive adsorption technology (DAT) is a promising, environmentally-benign method for destroying hazardous and toxic waste materials.  DAT, making use of high surface area nanoscale CaO and MgO as both reactants and catalysts, breaks down chlorinated organics, organophosphorus compounds, and other hazardous materials into simpler, less hazardous species. Application of DAT is limited,however by the high cost of producing nanoscale CaO and MgO powders.  PSI Technologies (PSIT) proposes a Phase I program to develop a novel technique for synthesizing high purity, low cost crystalline nanoscale MgO and CaO powders.  The technology utilizes a reactive aerosol in conjunction with combustion synthesis to produce a very high surface area nanoscale particulate in a continuous flow process.  This process is conceptually simple, and is expected to be easily scalable to large volumes.  Preliminary estimates suggest that a full-scale system capable of producing powders at costs of less than $10 to 30 per pound can be developed.  These costs are significantly less than those of competing processes.  Success in this program should facilitate development of DAT as a waste destruction technology.",

        "abstract": "Incineration of Municipal Solid Wastes (MSW) often results in the emission oftoxic heavy metals, such as lead and cadmium.  Previous work has demonstrated theability of some aluminosilicates sorbents, including common coal-borne minerals,to capture lead and cadmium vapors and, thereby, prevent their emission.  Leadand cadmium capture by such sorbents have been shown to be non-leachable.  PSITechnologies, therefore, proposes a unique process for heavy metals control:  co-incineration of coaselection of the optimum coal, giving cost-effective metals removal.  The coal-borne minerals will ahelp to stabilize feed quality in MSW incinerators.In the Phase I effort, PSI Technologies will explore the feasibility the proposedmetals control strategy by utilizing a carefully selected coal to capture leadand cadmium during combustion.  Metal vapors, coal, and chlorine will be combinedin various combinations in an entrained flow reactor and ash collected todetermine capture efficiency and product leachability.  Phase II will exploreimportant coal characteristics, with the goal of providing a coal selectionmethodology, and demonstrating the process on a pilot scale unit.",

Harris, the team member providing semiconductor foundry support, has expressed a profound interest in this technology to enhance their product base for military and commercial space electronics.  MIS capacitors will be designed, fabricated, packaged, and tested. Various ultra-thin interfacial layers and diamond deposition techniques will be employed to evaluate potential gate dielectrics with high resistivity and low density of charge trapping centers in the dielectric or at the interfaces.  Evaluation criteria will include film grain size and thickness uniformity, metal adhesion, film-substrate adhesion and interfacial physical properties, capacitance-voltage (CV) characteristics, dielectric breakdown, interface state trapping centers, gate conductivity, resistance to single event gate rupture (SEGR), and response to ionizing dose.",

Power, weight and aircraft performance are negatively effected by traditinal suppression concepts and therefore, a new approach to the design problem is required.  The proposed design effort will explore a unique design solution to reduce weight and aircraft drag.  A complaint flexible seal between the turbine's aft flange and the suppressor duct provides reduced vibration load in the suppressor so material thickness can be reduced. The cooling process utilized in this design is a combination of high level of exhaust plume dilution by ejection of ambient air, cooling of exposed parts, and shielding of hot turbine parts.  Advanced high temperature composite materials are currently available that are 30% lighter than traditional turbine exhaust materials.  The drag impacts are minimizd by a high aspect ratio duct with close fairing to the engine nacelle.  Analysis will be conduted to establish the performance of the design as well as the estimated weight and drag impacts.  The applicability of such a lightweight suppression system will be evaluated for the following SOF aircraft:  C-130, H-47D, H-53D, H-60, and the MV-X.",

The Fleet TMA algorithms process active measurements of range and bearing as observed relative to an ownship moving platform.  The techniques which offer significant improvement in solution quality include doppler enhancement, acoustic sensor weighting by SNR, variable averaging periods, overlapping averaging periods, assigning solution qualities, and independent parameter verifications.  There is no easy way to incorporate all of the enhancements in any one of the TMA algorithms without changing the basic assumptions that were used to derive each of the TMA algorithms.  We propose to modify an existing TMA algorithm that is based on a more general target motion model.  This algorithm has been used primarily in a passive environment to do post-exercise reconstruction, but it can also operate in    real- time.  Within each time window, this algorithm assumes that the target is traveling at constant acceleration and turn rate, rather than constant course and speed. All of the enhancement techniques are already available within this algorithm. This TMA algorithm degenerates to a standard Kalman filter under certain assumptions.",

Existing explosive and aluminum powder fuel components have an energy content of 2,500 to 7,390 kcal/kg.  The proposed research will demonstrate the ability to produce SSAHP with a Specific Calorific Powder (SCP) up to 20,000 kcal/kg.  The resulting SSAHP can be used as a high energy component for explosives, volume air charge and a rocket fuel component.  The limitations of hydrogen in combination with crystalline aluminum as detailed by quantum theory are overcome by evaporating aluminum powder in an RFP and fixing it in an amorphous state.  The molten metal-gas matrix is rapidly cooled fixing the super saturated powder in its measurable state.  The final product is passivated using accepted industry practiced before being combined with the other components for a warhead.  Tests comparing SSAHP with powdered aluminum (SCP of 7,390 kcal/kg) confirmed a doubling of explosive effect.  Optimizing the hydrogen content of SSAHP at or near the theoretical limit will further improve the explosive effect of the compound, up to seven times.",

        "abstract": "A new laser protective material for protection from battlefield lasers is proposed.  The material utilizes novel polarizing metal spheroid film (MSF) coatings which function as wavelenght-tuned polarizers in the spectral band from 400 nm to 2200 nm.  Each MSF coating can be disigned to place the peak absorption at specific laser wavelengths in this band while maintaining normal transmission at longer and shorter wavelenghts.  A filter for laser line blocking is formed by crossed polarizer layers, thus producing high optical density at the wavelength of laser light and transparency in other parts of the spectral band.  Multiple tuned MSF layers form cutoff filters for multiple laser lines.  MSF polarizing coatings will also be developed for active optical switches, tunable filters and passive optical limiters for protection against fixed wavelength and wavelength agile lasers. The MSF coatings block specific laser wavelengths yet provides for normal vision when the shutter is closed.  The proprietary MSF polarizing coating process was developed for NASA and the National Science Foundation by Polatomic.  The Phase I Technical Effort will include design, fabrication and characterization of wavelength tuned MSF coatings in partnership with Caltech-JPL.  In Phase I we will design and demonstrate laser protective material and investigate applications for dynamic laser protective eyewear, windows and shutters.  A Phase II Process Development Plan for fabricating and demonstrating the MSF material in rapid-response laser protective devices will be prepared.",

Components of the generator system will include a lightweight, high frequency alternator (HFA) coupled with power frequency conversion (PFC) components to produce high-quality, MIL-STD, 60 hertz power.  The generator system will include controls that maintains the output power quality with changing engine speed and with steady-state and transient load changes.  Recent developments in power semiconductor devices and circuits indicate a high probability that improvement in generator sets is achievable.  At any given power level devices are now available that allow operation at higher frequency with attendant savings in size, weight and cost.  It is easier to integrate these new devices into circuits because of their design and because interfacing integrated circuits are becoming available.  This Phase I project is a tradeoff analysis to identify: (1) the optimum improved system design, (2) The optimum power semiconductor technology for power control and for interfacing integrated circuits, and (3) The optimum power semi-conductor topology.  The analysis will cover the power ranges of 5-30 kw, 30-100 kw, and 100-1,000 kw.",

        "abstract": "Sensor management presents a problem of great importance to the Department of Defense.  New sensors, harder-to-detect platforms, increasingly sophisticated threats, and the need to reduce friendly fire incidents through accurate target identification are increasing the need to effectively and rapidly collect and exploit sensor data so that appropriate actions can be taken. However, the complexity of real world sensor data and scenarios has challenged efforts to automatically manage sensors.  Specifically, ad hoc approaches, as well as theoretically sound approaches, have focused on on-line computation of option prioritization and schedules.  Because of the real-time nature of sensor management, these approaches have been \"myopic,\" i.e., they have focused their computations on the immediate rewards of decisions without looking ahead to see the longer-term consequences of the decisions.  The objectives of the proposed project is to design and document an effective software architecture for non-myopic sensor management and sense task scheduling.  This real-time sensor manager will combine state-of-the-art incremental decision-theoretic on-line methods with off-line learning of plausible actions and search control heuristics.",

Inspection processes are crucial in the fabrication of these components, assuring the economical production of high quality, state-of-the-art components.  Current inspection processes for subminiature electronic assemblies typically rely on a single sensor and a single line of processing to detect defects in components.  However, single-sensor processes are limited by equipment sensitivity and reliability.  The fusion of evidence from multiple sensors can enhance the performance of sensor-based processes.  For example, research and development in military situation assessment has produced a significant number of general research results and application frameworks.  The objective of the proposed project is to design and document an implementable, functional fusion architecture for inspection of microelectronic components to increase the probability of detecting defects, reduce the incidence of false alarms, and allow discrimination between various types of defects.  This active, multi-sensor fusion architecture will incorporate a real-time, on-line cycle of information gathering and evidence combination, as well as the off-line capability to assess historical data and form models for combining evidence.",

This new type of lens has many advantages over both traditional refractive lenses and common diffractive elements.  The staircase lens is an excellent tool to use for correcting thermal effects, chromatic aberration, or field curvature.  The advantages of the staircase lens arise from the fact it has an infinite focal length (zero power) at the nominal temperature, wavelength, and field coordinate.  Deviations in temperature, wavelength, and field coordinate give the staircase lens power, allowing it to correct the aberrations of other elements in the system.",

Implicit in the multisystem function array is the need to operate many of these systems simultaneously.  Additionally the array should be capable of controlling fundamental radiation characteristics such as beamwidth, beam size, sidelobe levels and radiated power, in order to realize the different antenna characteristics required by the various systems.  It is also intended to have a self healing capability to retain a degree of usefulness in the event of battle damage or component failures. In order to achieve the above objectives Princeton Microwave Technology Inc. proposes to explore  an active array during Phase 1 of the SBIR. The array aperture consists of a large number of radiating elements that are spaced approximately half a wave-length at the upper end of the operational frequency band.  The frequency response and excitation of each element in the aperture can be independently controlled. This enables the antenna to reconfigure around damaged areas or to vary the array illumination.  The aperture can be fully utilized at the lowest frequency or can be shared among functions operating at higher frequencies.",

It is expected to produce capacitances of Farads in volumes usually limited to micro Farads without the low voltage, low current limitations of many electrolytic types. Because energy stored is proportional to the product of capacitance times the square of the voltage, our concept may permit very high stored energy densities, and its high current capability will permit it to deliver high power. The concept involves two approaches, both of which employ electrically conductive polymers. The first uses conductive polymer electrodes impregnated into a high surface to volume ratio porous dielectric. The second uses dielectric domains chemically produced on the surface of a conductive polymer to give extremely high apparent surface to volume ratios. Both are expected to produce exceedingly dense capacitors with voltage and current capabilities well beyond those of other high density types. The U.S. Armed Forces will have a novel high energy density storage system available to them that uses no hazardous materials.",

As the Army moves to an increasingly Digitized battlefield, this present manual artillery fire control sight will be the limiting element in the requirement to conduct responsive, effective, and safe fire support.  It is proposed that a Digital Howitzer Sight (DHS) be developed that can be retrofitted onto existing towed and self-propelled howitzers with minimal modification to the existing weapon.

Miniature electronic displays exploit microelectronics manufacturing technology to produce high resolution active matrix displays at high yield and low cost.  Assembly of a hybrid diffractive- refractive microlens array magnifier to a miniature electronics display will effect a large visible field with a high fill factor in a low weight, low profile, high performance package.  The anticipated result will be a viable, scalable process for economical fabrication of large size passive or active matrix flat panel electronic displays with high efficiency, high resolution and high contrast but with low profile and low weight for military and commercial applications.",

        "abstract": "Through this Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) effort, Quality Research Associates, Inc. (QRA) developed and determined the feasibility of an enhanced dynamic fault tree analysis methodology for safety and risk assessment of critical computer-based systems (CBS).  CBS are being used in many critical applications where failures can lead to loss of life or severe economic or environmental consequences.  These systems must be designed to high standards for dependability.  One of the means to do dependability assessment is fault tree analysis.  Currently available fault tree analysis tools are not adequate or effective when the system to be evaluated is large, complex, dynamic, or includes non-hardware influences. Feasibility of the methodology was determined by using the methodology to evaluate three diverse and complex systems.  This new methodology will help users more effectively model and analyze critical system dependability, yielding the potential for more dependable and safe systems. This new methodology and resulting tool can be applied to many types of CBS. Features of the methodology (which we call SHADETree(TM)) include the ability to perform system dependability evaluation, evaluate large systems, evaluate dynamic systems, provide ease of use, include all significant influencing factors in the evaluation, and perform supporting and complementary analyses.

The Decision System has several components including an acoustic source modeling component, an acoustic propagation component, a visualization/audio component, and an applications module.  The technical basis for the system is the adaption and refinement of source and propagation noise models successfully employed in undersea acoustic simulation and modeling to the modeling of aircraft noise and atmospheric propagation.  Phase I will define modeling and simulation approaches and components necessary to the development of a digital model database for noise emitted by fixed and rotary wing aircraft, the propagation of this noise through the atmosphere, and the sound pressure levels experienced by human and animal populations in the resulting acoustic fields.",

        "abstract": "Metal Semiconductor Metal (MSM) photodetectors are used in a wide range of commercial and military applications such as phased array radars, photonic gates for MIMIC circuits, analog circuits for imaging with neutral networks, optical detectors for communication links and optical ports for computer optical interconnects. The performance of these MSM detectors can be greatly enhanced through the use of GaAs materials grown at low temperatures. The low temperature material exhibit short carrier lifetimes due to trapping by defects. This results in reduced response times and, resulting, higher frequency response as already reported in the literature. This work proposed here involves the novel addition of a GaAs/AlGaAs heterojunction which yields carrier conduction in a two dimensional electron gas which greatly improves the electron mobility. The enhanced mobility allows the detector to respond to higher frequency modulation. The epitaxial wafers will be grown using the molecular beam epitaxy technique to allow excellent control of the material parameters as required for high performance operation. The ability to modulate MSM photodetectors at higher speed to allow greater amounts of information to be transmitted. The use of the AlGaAs/GaAs heterojunction should greatly improve the frequency response of the MSM photodetector.",

With the demonstration of the first intersubband laser this past year at AT&T Bell Labs, a new class of laser material was introduced. The extension of this work to the GaAs/AlGaAs material system will expand the possibilities for bandgap engineering for these novel structures. The new devices, unlike traditional lasers, are unipolar. Like their detector counterpart, the Quantum Well Intersubband Photodector (QWIP), the new design freedom found in the intersubband transitions will allow emission wavelengths from 4 microns to 100 microns as well as integration of multi-wavelength emitters within the same device. The development of intersubband lasers will extend the mature technology of the GaAs/AlGaAs materials system into the 4-5 micron wavelength operating region. Current solid state laser sources operating in this region are based on lead salts which are notoriously unreliable and low powered.",

To achieve this improved performance without cryogens or other bulky apparatus, we combine a new sensor technology with sensitivity-improving techniques that were originally developed for SQUID applications and could not work with previous sensors.

Phase I will develop a theoretical noise model for HTS SQUID amplifiers with wideband electronics and validate it experimentally. Phase I will establish the sensor performance improvements achievable with the new amplifier technology, leading to integration of a prototype amplifier with a sensor system in Phase II. Together with new, wideband SQUID electronics developed by the firm with IBM, they enable a new, low-impedance amplifier technology of unprecedentedly low noise, wide bandwidth, high dynamic range, and high common mode rejection ratio.

This proposal presents solutions to all of the key technical problems, drawing on a substantial body of work by the proposers in both the design and development of HTS systems and the use of SQUIDs for detecting corrosion. We first discuss in detail the key system features and requirements. We then describe solutions to specific problems, incorporating several recent proprietary advances in SQUID technology. In addition, we propose a new type of SQUID array which overcomes the practical problems of detecting the magnetic signal produced by corrosion. We propose an HTS corrosion detection system that is fully portable, cooled by a closed-cycle refrigerator, and capable of operation without magnetic shielding in practical environments. In Phase II, we will build an HTS SQUID system based on the design from Phase I.

Previous attempts to fabricate commercially viable aluminum stabilized conductors have, however, been unsuccessful because of the great disparity in the metal forming properties of NbTi and aluminum.  This disparity of flow stresses has led to the use of higher resistivity aluminum alloys as conductor matrices.  These conductors have met with marginal success. The present approach involves applying aluminum to a NbTi/copper composite.  The challenge is, of course, achieving complete metallurgical bonding and uniform cross-section.  Through the use of an orthogonal extrusion process whereby aluminum is solid state bonded to a copper conductor we have successfully clad a wide range of superconductors with high purity aluminum. our latest effort culminated in cladding two pieces of 30,0001 of NbTi wire having a 0.5mm cross- section and an aluminum/superconductor ratio of 3 to 1. Our current machine has a few shortcomings including: limited extrusion pressure, is sequential as opposed to continuous, aluminum chamber capacity, bonding irregularities.  We feel these limitations can be overcome with the design of a larger machine incorporating proprietary modifications.",

        "abstract": "The DoD is seeking the development of analytical methodology and instrumentation with graphic imaging capabilities to determine the quantity and speciation of metals found in contaminated soils.  In this SBIR Phase I submission we are proposing to develop an Imaging Mass Detector (IMD) which acquires both mass and energy dispersive spectra from locations on the sample and generates images based on molecular weight and elemental determinations.  Combined with a database of standard mass spectra, compounds would be identified and mapped.  The heart of this instrument is a low level (252) Cf (californium) source, which desorbs and ionizes sample molecules via fission fragments.  Californium fragments cause rapid, high energy desorption and ionization which generate simple mass spectrum patterns.  Imaging will be achieved through a new and innovative technique which takes advantage of the recoil fragments produced by Cf at each fission event.  The trajectories of the recoil fragments will be used to extrapolate to the hit positions of the forward fragment on the sample.  Applications of this instrument would be far reaching, including mapping and identification of nuclide, inorganic, and organic compounds in the mass range through 3000 amu.",

Millimeter waves penetrate fogs and clouds thus allowing for operation under conditions of adverse visibility.  In addition, millimeter waves penetrate clothing and reveal concealed weapons (plastic and metal).  Millimeter wave focal plane detector arrays (FPAs) are currently under development for imaging, but these devices. even when fully developed, will have significant cost.  In this proposal we describe two configurations for millimeter wave imaging with the potential of greatly reduced cost.  The first achieves good imaging when the detection is limited by intrinsic detector noise.  The second achieves good imaging when the detection is limited by signal induced shot noise.  The goal of the work proposed here is to establish the technical feasibility of the two configurations and to more adequately determine the cost and performance advantages versus the conventional FPA.",

A \"molecular sieve\" membranecould either remove these precursors from the water or remove the THM's from thefinished water stream.In Phase I, TDA Research will demonstrate that zeolite molecular sieve membranecan remove trihalomethanes and other impurities from water.  The flux andretention characteristics of zeolite membranes are superior to the recentlydeveloped nanofiltration polymeric membranes.  They will fabricated dense, crack-free zeolite filmsflux and retention of THM precursors and THMs and conduct an engineeringanalysis.  In Phase II, TDA Research will design and fabricate a prototype of azeolite film module and demonstrate its ability to remove THM contaminants.  Theywill investigate the fouling behavior and optimize cleaning techniques.",

This scheme is based on spatial spectral encoding and decoding of a low-cost wideband optical source, and optimal multi-user and single-use detection.  With optical CDMA, this system can support a large number of subscribers.  This number can be much higher than the number of active users that a network can support.  The number of users with a Gbps bandwidth can be in the thousands, yielding a total network channel capacity in the order of terabytes.  This scheme deals with the physical layer and is thus compatible with any network protocol, such as ATM for multirate multiple simultaneous users.  The proposed method has applications in areas ranging from satellite harness, avionics/computer back plane to many military and commercial LAN and WAN, etc.  We plan to develop a computer model for performance tradeoff and sensitivity analysis, and to investigate integrated photonics for low-cost implementation.",

While increasing the efficiency of the ammunition combat situations.  While increasing the efficiency of the ammunition handling and resupply operations, adaptive robotic control technology also reduces the exposure of military personnel to hazardous environments and missions.  An important capability of adaptive robotic control involves the ability to position a manipulator relative to objects of interest using sensory feedback.  recent research indicates vision has advantages as the primary  component of sensory feedback systems for robotic manipulator control.  This proposal examines the prospects for using intelligent vision based control systems for robotic manipulators in ammunition handling, loading, and resupply operations.  RedZone proposes to study and design methods of intelligent vision based servoing of robotic and telerobotic manipulators that will enhance the capabilities, adaptability, robustness, and autonomy of existing robotic controllers for tasks involving object tracking and manipulator positioning.  This research would result in a preliminary design for an intelligent visual servoing robotic manipulator control technology.  The technology would be modular in structure so that it can be added to existing robot control systems or integrated into new robotic and telerobotic control systems.",

        "abstract": "A method for treating wastewater to reduce the concentration of toxic metals to levels within the EPA guidelines is proposed.  In the method wastewater is placed in a sound field created by an ultra-sonic cylindrical transducer.  This periodic pressure field causes metals to move and collect into a dense mass and fall from suspension.  Removal of chromium, nickel, cadmium, lead, copper and zinc will be measured in a unit chamber to prove feasibility. Extension of the method to removal of ions will be studies.  A series of resonators will be built and flow-through units for use in on-process water purification will be designed. The cylindrical resonator represents an important break-through in separation science.  Particle manipulation by means of sound is known, but its application to commercial processes has been hampered by manufacturing difficulties.  The cylindrical resonator avoids these problems and places Sonic Separations next to filtration and centrifugation for separations.  The unit is easily manufactured at a reasonable cost and can be easily incorporated into treatment systems already in operation.  Wastewater treatment is the first in a large number of applications of Sonic Separations in such diverse fields as biotechnology, microelectronics and medical diagnostics.",

        "abstract": "The primary objective of this Phase I research is to develop a tool for evaluating the dependability of fault-tolerant computing systems.  Dependability has traditionally been evaluated through combinatorial and Markov modeling.  These analytical techniques have several limitations which can restrict their applicability. Simulation avoids many of the limitations, allowing for more precise representation of system attributes than feasible with analytical modeling.  However, the computational demands of simulating a system in detail, at a low abstraction level, currently prohibit evaluation of high level dependability metrics such as reliability and availability.  The new approach abstracts a system at the architectural level, and employs life testing though simulated fault-injection to accurately and efficiently measure dependability.  Based on an existing tool, called the REliable Architecture Characterization Tool (REACT), the new tool will incorporate parallelism and variance reduction techniques to reduce execution time and enable the affordable analysis of computing systems with ultrahigh reliabilities (R(t)>1 - 10 -9).",

Current hardware was designed with peak velocities at Mach 8.  The proposed program is to develop a set of analytical software products which will both support DOD requirements and be a commercially viable product in the increasingly competitive aerospace market.  REMTECH's approach is based on using the REM-AHEAT module of the REMTHERM set of software as the cornerstone in a new set of software.  REM-AHEAT is an advanced set of user-friendly software which claims its origins in the earlier MINIVER code.  The Phase I technical objective is to add shock impingement heating methodology to the existing software.  The approach that REMTECH will use for developing the shock impingement heating method will be to select one or more of the empirical pressure interaction correlations developed and verified using existing experimental data.  The feasibility of the analytical software shall be demonstrated in Phase I by prediction of the heating environments and identification of candidate TPS materials for a set of specific critical areas of the Holloman rocket sled.",

        "abstract": "While much of the data involved in product and order definition has been captured in standard electronic structures such as STEP and EDI, material and process specifications are still handled as amorphous paper-based documents.  The use of manual, paper-based specifications is an extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming process.  Specifications are an integral part of the product definition process and the use of unstructured, textual-based specifications is a major obstacle in achieving an agile manufacturing enterprise.\n\nRenaissance Engineering, with the assistance of the Industrial Technology Institute, proposes to define an architecture and a new business model which uses structured electronic specifications to assist in the product configuration and planning process.  The proposed solution involves the definition of a meta-specification within the STEP framework and the integration of the structuring effort with the NIST-sponsored National Standards Systems Network (NSSN).  The solution will leverage the pseudo-database capabilities of SGML to enable the NSSN to create specifications that can be used both to generate a traditional document and to maintain specifications in the STEP meta-specification structure.  Instead of treating the design requirements in the specifications as simple textual narrative, our approach recognizes that specifications are an integral part of product data and product data exchange.",

        "abstract": "Many opto-electronic systems require the modulation of optical radiation. In particular, the modulation of light is essential to optical communications systems, detectors, and sensors for many missile defense applications. This modulation is typically accomplished electro-optically. Traditional materials used to bring about the modulation often have slow response times or require high voltages. In order to meet the ever increasingly stringent demands of advanced optical systems, it has become necessary to search for new electro-optic materials with high modulation efficiency, fast switching times, and low switching voltages. The problems of prior art technology have been eliminated by Reveo's high speed solid state spatial light modulator (SLM). The heart of the device is a newly identified E-O material known as RbHSeO4. Projected half-wave voltages are on the order of 27 volts with switching times less than or equal to one nanosecond. The ultimate goal of this program is the fabrication of an N x M pixelated SLM array with these characteristics. In Phase II, an SLM with N, M - 128 will be fabricated. Phase III will consist of the rapid introduction of revolutionary SLM-based products to the market. Anticipated military/government applications include C3I and pattern recognition systems. Potential civilian applications in the communications arena include information systems, telephones, optical computing and interconnects. Displays for television and video games/entertainment are other obvious dual-use technologies. Application of SLMs for robotic vision systems in industrial assembly lines and automated inspection systems are also envisaged.",

        "abstract": "Design of a novel digital signal processing (DSP) radiometer system is proposed, which combines a low-noise, high stability radio frequency (RF) down-converter, a high speed digitizer with a deep buffer memory, and a personal computer running an innovative DSP software known as X-Midas.  X-Midas allows the user to construct a software DSP system by selecting functional blocks through a user-friendly interface and has many other novel features.  For accurate time and position determination, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver is included.  A communications link for connecting other radiometer instruments permits correlated measurements or may be used to geo-locate emitters.  The resulting measurement receiver can easily be software reconfigured to  perform many difficult measurement tasks, such as evaluation of spread-spectrum low-probability of intercept (LPI) communications and radar systems.  The initial task of such an instrument will be to investigate the RF background noise environment at 316 MHz, 1 GHz, and 3.16 GHz, and determine background noise stationarity as a function of center frequency, bandwidth, integration time, time of day, date, antenna pattern, altitude and location.",

Tissue pH is an acutely sensitive indicator of circulatory demise and tissue perfusion. Currently, arterial bood gas measurments are used to measure tissue pH, but they are relatively slow and require the drawing of a blood sample.  A non-invasive deep tissue pH monitor would provide an instantaneous and continuous measure of tissue pH. The pH monitor will use infrared spectroscopy to obtain deep tissue pH information in a non-invasive manner.  Multivariate data analysis techniques will be applied to the spectral data to quantify pH information from the spectra.  The multivariate technique will e calibrated using standard, well-accepted methods for obtaining pH information and for characterization of this information.  The blood and mscle cell samples will be carefully designed such that sample pH values will not correlate with any associated chemical species in the samples that might also have a spectroscopic signature.  In Phase II of the research project.  further animal and human studies will be conducted, and the results will facilitate the development of a prototype deep tissue pH instrument.",

        "abstract": "Proposed is the development of a two-stage cooling system to meet the rapid cool down requirements of optical sensor components. The proposed device will integrate a regenerative complex-compound cooling engine to cool the load to approximately -60\u00c2\u00bfC, at which point a blowdown system will complete the cooling mission to -100 to -120\u00c2\u00bfC.  At the present time, an open cycle refrigerant blowdown system is one of the preferred methods. This works well on single mission vehicles such as missiles, but on space stations, satellites and ground based applications that have a longer life cycle requiring several missions, a regenerative system is desirable to minimize the amount of refrigerant storage. Like the blowdown method, the proposed two-stage system provides rapid cool down from storage conditions to battle readiness, which mechanical cryocoolers and Joule-Thompson open-cycle refrigerators cannot. The focus of this proposal is the evaluation of the two-stage approach and the design and construction of a proof-of-concept complex-compound engine for the regenerative first stage. Complex compound cooling engines are reliable and lightweight, with no moving parts except for check valves. The rapid-cooling regenerative engine will be perfectly suited for two niche cooling applications. Connected to a small freezer compartment, it will provide a small blast freezer or \"quick freeze\" appliance and the thermal storage capability provides non powered cooling capacity at a later time and location instantaneously. Significant cost sharing of Phase II would be likely if Phase I is successful.",

        "abstract": "Unsteady forces caused by Vortex bursting in the vicinity of an aircraft structure evoke structural responses called buffeting which can inflict severe damage on an aircraft structural.  Modal identification tests performed on the complete F-15 aircraft at Dobins Air Force Base have also shown that certain modes of dynamic response characteristics occur which are not necessarily restricted to the motion of only vertical tail.  in several critical modes, the wing and the horizontal tail are involved.  This has the effect of introducing quadratic non linearities and amplifying or creating high amplitude vibrations which together with vortex induced motion at high angle of attack cause buffet.  Tail vibrations and tail buffet are common problems which twin tailed aircraft such as this F-15 and F-18 experience.  A significant reduction of the buffet problem is sought by the application of smart structures.  At critical frequency regions characteristic of buffet, Smart Structures alter the response of the material in such a way that buffeting is reduced.  Several types of actuators and actuator installations will be examined and their applicability for buffet alleviation will be identified.  Some simple experiments on a model will be performed, and the feasibility of reducing vibrations at a selected band of frequencies will be demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "The reduction to practice of advanced material and process technologies are often the key to realization of significant improvements in turbine blade airfoil performance. Today they can be gained by developing a casting process capable of far greater degrees of accuracy, precision, and thinness than currently possible.  The development of a plastic pattern material with superior dimensional control and unique in-process inspection features is the key.  Infiltration of this pattern by a ceramic compound supplants the core placement step and assures improved dimensional control.  Three resin systems will be evaluated.  Trial injections of simple shapes leads to subsequent critical testing for dimensional characteristics, compatibility between the plastic materials and the ceramic compounds, and ease of the pattern removal.  Ceramic injection materials will be evaluated for flow and fill characteristics and more tests for compatibility with the selected plastic pattern material, the critical characteristics of the ceramic material include the ability to fill small (less than 20 mils) cooling passages, smooth surfaces, no included voids, and strong and stable enough to survive pattern removal as well as the casting process.  This project will define and demonstrate for the USAF the capability of a plastic pattern and ceramic core injection concept to meet the increased dimensional accuracy demands of precision cast, higher performance turbine airfoils.  To improve the in-process inspectability, significantly improve the process yield for precision cast thin-walled airfoils, and thus dramatically lower component costs.",

This proposed development is expected to result in miniature, automated, instrumentation with broad chemical analysis capabilities and near real-time response This new instrumentation will have the capability to perform research studies to resolve key issues surrounding important chemicals in the marine environment such as dimethylsulfide (DMS), a key precursor leading to cloud condensation nuclei. The proposed Phase I effort takes state-of-the-art developments in micromachined chemical instrument components and demonstrates the feasibility of miniature oceanographic instrumentation based upon these components. The resulting instrumentation is expected to provide new capabilities for collecting oceanographic data with improved temporal and spatial scales, especially when coupled to UAVs and UUVS, and improved productivity in data collection.

        "abstract": "The notion of using an inexpensive inertial augmentation system for a tube launched ordnance, either with or without a terminal homing sensor, has existed for some time now.  The main drawback has been the high cost associated with reliable inertial components and the hardening problem with gyroscopes or other rate sensing elements. Some of the solutions that have been proposed to date attempt to either harden the rate sensing element or to measure minute coriolis forces using accelerometers.  The concept we are proposing solves this problem completely eliminating the requirement for a gyroscope, and using an adaptation of a commercial FM demodulator to extract roll position from the small electronic signal.  This configuration uses small, inexpensive accelerometers combined with a unique signal processing suite to measure roll position, and to then resolve the accelerometer output signals to obtain pitch and yaw.  This concept was initially explored under an IR & D effort, and then further developed under contract to the U.S. Army.  An extensive series of analyses, including detailed simulations, have confirmed the performance of the proposed technique.  This has been followed by an experiment series using a tethered, gun-launched projectile, which has further validated the analyses results.  The extension to the  use of this configuration as a low-cost INS is also reasonable, and performance should be consistent with that of a conventional 3-axis Schuler loop type of system, for the required limited operating time.  In addition, the technique we have developed for the accurate measurement of roll position may have other important applications related to the inexpensive and very accurate measurment of roll angle for a Rolling Airframe Missile, and for guidance of an X-rod type projectile.",

AF MIL-STD-1761 test procedures allow experiments to detect improved damage tolerance for new designs.  We conclude, after a thorough review of both the recess drive and test method prior art, that continued efforts which limit the torque application to the head will not solve the core problem.  While some designs may offer an improvement over others, no design offers an acceptable damage tolerant recess drive solution.  The SBST approach will solve the problem by distributing the installation and removal torque along the length of the fastener.  Fasteners with internal bores and torque carrying features, e.g. splines along with the mating installation/removal tool, will be developed and analyzed in Phase I.  This concept has broad commercial applications ranging from high strength, lightweight fasteners for commercial and military aircraft to instrumented fasteners for large fixed structures such as skyscrapers and bridges (internal bores properly instrumented would allow more accurate preloads and checks).",

        "abstract": "One advanced structural concept with enormous potential is the active control of wing camber.  Current wing designs are compromises at all but one optimal airspeed.  The capacity to alter camber as flight conditions change will provide greater lift and maneuverability, reduced dray, increased range, lower fuel consumption, and reduced operating costs.  Smart materials such as magnetostrictive Terfenol-D have important advantages such as no bearings, simple construction, low maintenance, and electric operation.  Past efforts using smart materials for camber control have been limited by the low energy density of the materials used. Use of shape memory alloys (SMA) has not been explored in depth. The proposed work utilizes the SMA Nitinol because it produces greater than 3% strains while competing \"giant\" magnetostrictive materials are limited to .15% strain (1,500 parts per million). Large control authority is the enabling feature of the SMA camber actuator.  Response of SMA actuators is typically slow because of thermal effects; however, the camber actuator need react only to slow flight regime changes.  Various means of SMA camber actuation are proposed including direct drive and SMA composite materials which will be fabricated.  Experiments will measure the performance of SMA camber control, and in-service feasibility will be determined.",

        "abstract": "The Army's need for a compact, power dense gas turbine engine can be met by utilizing the heat rejected by the intercooler and exhaust of a intercooled engine.  SatCon is in the process of building and testing a 500 HP, twin rotor, intercooled, turbo-alternator for the Chrysler Corporation.  The power density of the engine, inclusive of the alternators, is better than 2.5 HP/lb electrical output.  This turbo-alternator is an excellent platform for developing a bottoming cycle utilizing the heat rejection from the intercooler and the exhaust to enhance the power output and efficiency of the overall engine.  Preliminary calculations show that the inclusion of a closed cycle (Rankine) steam turbine running off the intercooler and exhaust heat can almost double the engine power output.  The closed cycle steam turbine clearly increases the complexity of the overall engine. The Phase I proposal is to design a closed cycle steam turbine engine as an \"add on\" to the existing 500 HP intercooled engine work and to study the trade-offs involved in increased power/efficiency and added complexity.  A Phase II program will build a steam turbine engine and demonstrate and evaluate its performance as part of the existing 500 HP intercooled engine.",

The 2- micron laser has been developed for lidar applications, and produces up to 4.6 W of CW, TEM, power. The membrane mirrors are commercially available (manufactured by Optron Systems, Inc.) and can be modulated at rates of 1 MHz or more. Simultaneous ship-to-aircraft communication would be effected by modulating the CW laser electro- optically at tens of megahertz, whereas aircraft-to-ship communication would be accomplished by modulating the return signal with the retroreflector. The proposed system would acquire the retroreflected signal, perhaps using the modulation to enhance the signal, then switch to a communication mode while a quadrant detector/tracking system automatically maintains the laser pointing at the aircraft. The proposed Phase I effort consists of a feasibility study and the testing of a membrane mirror. A prototype system would be constructed and tested under a following Phase II.",

It is recognized by the Navy and SEO that most existing laser technology using active Q-switches (electro-optics, acousto-optics, rotating mirror devices) increase the size, complexity and cost of the laser beyond the practical limits for a one shot laser initiation application.  Also, these types of lasers preclude the option of coating an output coupler directly on the laser rod. SEO, with the help of Dr. Michael Bass's group at the Center for Research and Education in Electro-Optics and Lasers (CREOL), proposes to apply the recent techniques of self Q-switched solid state lasers for this application.  Thus, we propose a monolithic (laser medium, Q-switch and resonator mirrors on laser rod) device called All in One Laser Rod (AOLR). In the Phase I program, theoretical analysis for the AOLR approach will be performed at CREOL.  The theoretical model will be verified by conducting laboratory experiments at SEO.  Based on the model and experiments, a preliminary AOLR design for a low-cost, compact, weapons-quality laser suitable for ordnance system will be developed in the Phase I program.",

The full potential of this technology will not be realized until simple, rugged systems are developed that can be left alone to routinely perform their measurement tasks.  We propose to significantly advance toward this goal by first conducting an in-depth study of an eye-safe coherent lidar to determine which parts can be ruggedized and which parts need to be automatically optimized for long-term, unattended operation.  Next, we propose to operate a prototype lidar, presently under construction, for extended periods to identify which components drift, and what effect this has on the system's performance.  We will develop a signal processing algorithm that will determine, from the measured wind velocity as a function of range, whether a microburst is present, and if so classify its intensity or the danger to aviation it poses. Finally, we will design from scratch a laser radar that incorporates these findings and propose that it be constructed under Phase II of this effort.",

Unique features of these accelerators include high repetition rate (> 5000 pps), all-solid-state pulsed-power drivers which  make these accelerators scalable to megawatt power levels at a capital cost for the accelerator of less than $3/Watt.  SRL has assembled a three-way collaboration to develop and test new electron-beam curable resins for primary structural composite applications.  The team includes two resin-material suppliers, personnel at the University of Delaware Center for Composite Materials (CCM) and SRL.  The results of Phase I experiments will determine the properties of several novel resin formulations, fiber sizings and electron beam curing parameters on composite material properties.  The Phase I results will allow fabrication of prototype vehicle structures with optimized mechanical properties during Phase II.",

We have proposed an innovative computer workstation architecture-Scientific Workstation for Operations, Research, and Development (SWORD) - for storing and manipulating a large number of effects testing waveform data records.  The proposed SWORD architecture is based on a standardized data compression technique, file format, and a signal processing toolbox.  These standards are independent of hardware and software platforms and can be readily adopted by existing simulator facilities, DARE program and user organizations.  Organizations using the SWORD architecture will minimize data processing turnaround times and readily archive/exchange data files and processing tools across various computer platforms.  This technology has applications in other government and commercial activities.  examples are the other Phillips Laboratory facilities which routinely record large numbers of EM effects data.  Commercial aircraft manufacturers have expressed interest in using SWORD as a fool to evaluate susceptibility to HIRF requirements.",

        "abstract": "In this SBIR proposal, a variety of new and novel innovations are proposed for the target-tracking estimation problem involving large and rapidly changing target accelerations. An essential feature of the tracking problem is that the radar tracker measurements are best modeled in spherical coordinates and the target dynamics are best described in rectangular coordinates. A class of filters that produce significant improvements are tracking filters using Extended Kalman Filters (EKF) includes the Modified Gain EKF (MGEKF) and the pseudo-measurement filter. For both these filters, the estimation error propagates almost linearly. Besides proposing the MGEKF, new target models are suggested based on the assumption that certain targets execute evasive maneuvers orthogonal to their velocity vector. Furthermore, this orthogonality is also enforced by the addition of fictitious pseudo auxiliary measurements. Finally, a robust form of the MGEKF is developed based upon the dissipative inequality. The robust game-theoretic MGEKF requires adjustment by use of tuning parameters that win be adjusted during the simulation phase. Another serious problem in radar target tracking is false alarms due to clutter. Recent work by Scientific Systems has shown that the false alarms can be reduced and target resolution enhanced by using a Stochastic Realization Algorithm (SRA) instead of FFT to process the radar I&Q data. Significant improvements in tracking accuracy are expected by the use of SRA in conjunction with robust MGEKF tracking algorithms. Dr Jason Speyer, a leading expert on robust target estimation, will provide consulting support.",

        "abstract": "We propose a new paradigm for CAD which aims to support the early stages of mechanical design well enough that designers axe motivated to use the workstation as a conceptual design tool. The basic approach is that of shape synthesis - the automated generation of part designs.  Many mechanical components can be defined by two kinds of geometry: features which are critical to its function (application features), and material which constitutes the body (bulk shape).  Application features are high-level entities in terms of which the designer can reason about the design.  Bulk shape must obey certain constraints - such as non-interference, minimum structural strength, etc. Our team has developed a system wherein the designer inputs the application features, along with topological and other constraints, and the bulk shapes of the parts are automatically synthesized. Overall economy is enhanced by reducing the input necessary from the designer, providing a more complete exploration of design space, and enhancing manufacturability of the component parts. We have already developed a simple software system for 2-D component designs.  Our Phase I effort will focus on developing this technology for more general design problems.  Specific tasks include (1) development of skeleton generation algorithms, (2) skeleton optimization, (3) material synthesis algorithms, (4) user interface development, (5) manufacturing module extensions, and (6) multiply parameterized feature types.  Phase II will concentrate on softwaxe development of the prototype into a full-featured CAD design package, with applications to real-world mechanical design problems.  University of California, Berkeley (Prof.  Sastry and students), a pioneer in this field, will provide sub-contract support during Phases I and II of this project.",

        "abstract": "Future ship defense missiles will be required to intercept highly maneuverable anti-ship missiles at widely varying altitudes.  For effective operation of these agile interceptor missiles, the control system design must be nonlinear and robust.  The control system design should explicitly take into account all hard limits on control surface deflections and safety limits.  In addition, the control system must avoid aeroservoelastic instabilities by notching out the effect of flexible modes on the flight control system.  Over the last tow decades starting with the pioneering work of Richalet et. al (1976) in France and Culter et. al (1980) in USA, great progress has been made in the development of Model Predictive Control (MPC) methods for optimal control of nonlinear uncertain dynamic systems under nonlinear MPC design for a Navy agile interceptor missile and to demonstrate its capability for the engagement of highly maneuverable anti-ship missiles at high angles-of-attack.  The controller must be robust against unmodelled flexible dynamics and aerodynamic uncertainties at high angles-of-attack.   Specific Phase I tasks are: (1) Problem formulation, simulation and data acquisition.  (2) Identification of Flexible Modes using Stochastic Realization Algorithm (SRA). (3) Robust Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MPC) design.  (4) Controller tuning testing.  (5) Controller simplification and implementation.  Phase II will involve prototype controller development, implementation and delivery to the Navy for flight testing.

These modifications offer the potential to greatly reduce the drive currents required for high-speed laser modulation, enhance the electrical/optical conversion efficiency, and eliminate link losses due to laser/transmission line impedance mismatch.  The laser structure will provide the basis for the design and fabrication of a fully (hybrid) integrated, low-insertion-loss microwave optical transmitter module.

Owing to the relative newness of the industry, little emphasis has been placed upon domestication and the development of gentically enhanced stocks.  Transgenic technology offers a method to rapidly introduce genetically desirable traits which, in combination with long-term breeding programs, opens the possibility of making significant advances in the cost-effectiveness of the industry.\n\nWe have developed an effective method for the routine production of transgenic abalone which can be implemented on an industrial scale.  At present the technology is limited by suitable molecular vectors.  Development of such vectors will not only permit efficient expression of introduced genes, but will comply with current policy on the acceptability of transgenics produced by homologous DNA.  We have cloned an abalone actin promoter and are in the process of cloning abalone growth hormones and insulin-like-growth factors which we propose to couple to the abalone actin promoter to create an all-abalone gene construct for genetic enhancement of commercial abalone.  During Phase I of this project we propose to: (a) characterize the abalone actin promoter and its regulatory elements, (b) construct expression vectors with regulatory elements coupled to reporter genes, (c) transfer these gene constructs into abalone eggs and raise the larvae to adults, (d) study the transcriptional activity of the actin promoter in abalone including levels of expression through early development, and (e) optimize conditions for better integration of foreign DNA into the abalone germline.",

This work will build on work Secure Computing has previously done on the DTOS program.  In particular, the DTOS approach of providing flexible support for security will be used.

        "abstract": "The objectives are to develop and verify Built-In Test (BIT) techniques to assure cost effective/comprehensive methodologies for performing diagnostics for electronic modules for determining optimum C4I system maintenance level.  In addition to performing basic intended functions, many electronic devices also generate electromagnetic interference (EMI).  The EMI is often incidental to the normal operation of the device and may result from higher order effects (e.g., nonlinearities) in the device.  It has been noted that the EMI characteristics of an electronic device may exhibit large variations as a result of small changes in the normal operational characteristics of the device.  Based on observations of the EMI characteristics of electronic components and circuits, there appears to be a strong correlation between the performance of the device and the resulting EMI generated by the device.  Therefore, it is suggested that the EMI characteristics of a device may provide a good indication of the overall performance of a device and may provide a very sensitive means for measuring degradation of device performance.  SEMTAS will investigate the application of EMI measurements to diagnose the performance of electronic components and devices. Techniques that are applicable for BIT approaches will be emphasized.  The objectives of Phase I will be to develop BIT approaches for modules that are based on the application of EMI measurements and signal analysis to diagnose the performance of electronic components and devices.  Emphasis will be directed toward developing approaches that will satisfy specific DOD and commercial requirements.  Laboratory tests will be conducted to demonstrate the overall feasibility of the proposed technique for diagnosing degraded components.  This feasibility demonstration will be conducted on a selected type of component and circuit that is widely used in both military and civilian applications.",

The objective of this feasiblity study is to conduct tests to evaluate the device under a variety of conditions and to demonstrate the validity and viability of the sensor design.  Existing low-cost, high volume commercial devices designed to determine soil moisture by measuring electrical properties (conductance or capacitance) of an admixture of soil, water, salts, fertilizers, etc. have not been able to adequately resolve, utilize and/or interpret the components of reactive impedance (conductance/resistance and impedance) to provide an accurate, and repeatable measurements, especially measurements of soil moisture under a broad range of field conditions.  As a result, low cost, currently available sensors may operate under limited or idealized conditions, but do not function properly under a range of typical real world conditions.  An improved electronic design overcomes the short comings of earlier sensor designs providing a true, accurae measurement of capacitive reactance due to water in soil under a wide range of conditions.  In addition, other significant factors effecting the soil water content determination, including temperature, conductivity, and in-situ calibration, are addressed and solved in this innovative design.",

An off the shelf bank of anti-aliasing filters and an integrated analog to digital converter and digital signal processor will perform the bulk of the computations.  The system will carry out the functions of target detection, localization and tracking.  The beam forming function will be used for nulling self-noise and interference and for high resolution bearing estimation.  Two types of beam forming will be implemented: conventional delay - sum beam forming and minimum variance, adaptive beam forming.  12 to 24 fixed beams will be formed simultaneously.  In Phase II the system performance will be enhanced through the use of an adaptive noise cancellation algorithm using reference sensors to further reduce the contribution of self noise.",

        "abstract": "This project is investigating the application of magnetic recording and micromachine technologies to the development of a novel magnetic nondestructive evaluation (NDE) system.  Magnetic NDE methods based on Barkhausen signal detection and analysis can provide valuable information about the state of stress of steel materials.  However, Barkhausen signals do not appear to be correlated with the extent of mechanical damage or stress in the case of complex stress states or combined microstructural effects.  It is well known that the domain structure of magnetic material is dependent on the state of stress.  This is the basis of magnetic NDE techniques.  Much more information about the state of stress may be obtained from imaging the domain walls or wall motion.  We propose to investigate the domain imaging capabilities of a two-dimensional array of micron scale magnetic field sensors (recording heads).  In Phase I SFA will develop a simulation model for the imaging capabilities of an array of micron scale heads.  This will be accomplished by using finite element modeling of the head field and the reciprocity theorem.  The imaging properties of the array will be investigated by developing a phenomenological simulation of domain wall motion.  Techniques to fabricate the array based on macromachining processes will also be investigated.",

        "abstract": "Today, most solid modeling systems work well to precisely define the physical dimensions and properties of object's, but do not support automated reasoning. The capability to reason about model characteristics such as topology, tolerances, and complexity is important for developing integrated design and advanced manufacturing applications.   Existing systems are oriented toward representing the graphical and geometric aspects of a model. In contrast, future applications require part models to also contain specific knowledge relevant to each phase of the product lifecycle. No phase happens in isolation, each affects the others. Therefore, the engineer's intent and information specific to each phase of a product's life must be maintained for the life of the product model.   In current systems, reasoning capabaility is oftentimes missing or is elementary and not tightly integrated with the product model. We propose developing extensions to a commercial solid modeling toolkit that will enable robust reasoning mechanisms to be applied to the model. By combining object oriented programming methods with artificial intelligence techniques we can embed reasoning capabilities directly within the model.   Applications using the proposed technology will provide benefits including lower pre-production and manufacturing costs, shorter product cycles, and tighter integration of design, analysis, and manufacturing processes. ANTICIPATED BENEFIT: A solid modeling technology with integrated reasoning could be used as core technology for advanced design and manufacturing automation. It could be utilized as component technology or as a basis for standalone or embedded applications.",

Data may be obtained either as GFE from the AL, from the \"visible man\" project at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, or from our subcontractor, the University of New Mexico's School of Medicine (Center for Non-Invasive Diagnosis).  From the MRI data, an anatomical block model of a human will be constructed of 1 mm cells, where each sell will be assumed to be completely composed of 1 of 16 tissues types.  Tissue typing information will be extracted from the MRI data by use of contract information.  For instance, the scanner parameters can be adjusted to pick up differences in proton density, spin-lattice relaxation time (t1), and spin-spin relaxation time (t2).  Thus, fat can, for example, be hyperintense on T1-weighted images and hypointense on T2-weighted images.  Due to the huge amount of image data to process, anatomical boundaries will be determined and tissue types classified with maximal use of automation.  Specifically, we will implement neural networks to classify tissue type from MRI data using human-identified tissues to train the networks.",

        "abstract": "Photorefractive materials promise to enable dynamic holography and erasable high density data storage for future information technologies. This project will develop and demonstrate a holographic data storage technology using novel photorefractive polymers with electro-optic (EO) coefficients and bandwidths that are significantly superior than LiNbO3. An important advantage of these polymers is that large refractive index modulations can be reversibly generated in them with low power laser beams. Polymer composites based on poly(N-vinylcarbazole) have recently show excellent PR performance. However, the composites in their natural form lack long-time storage capabilities due to their low glass transition temperatures. This project innovatively overcomes this limitation by engineering highly cross-linked, permanently poled PR polymers. This will enable relatively low cost, long life holographic data storage technology. The program's technical approach is to orient acrylated EO chromophores in the liquid phase at room temperature with an electric field and to cross-link the material with electron radiation in a vacuum environment. The proposed method promises to be superior to previous approaches to permanently poled PR polymers and will enable the fabrication of materials with low weight, excellent mechanical properties, strong polar orientation and superior thermal aging characteristics. During Phase I, we will establish proof-of-concept of the holographic data technology in the photorefractive polymers; during Phase II material and product performance will be optimized and extensively tested. The technology is expected to play a key role in a variety of optical information processing applications; e.g. dynamic holography, erasable high density data storage, parallel signal/image processing, phase conjugation, pattern recognition, optical interconnects and others.",

        "abstract": "Hydrazine is a highly toxic compound that is widely used as a rocket fuel in U.S. space programs.  Since very low concentrations of hydrazine are considered hazardous, there is need for sensors that are robust, cheap, sensitive and selective.  Sigma Labs proposes a low cost manufacturing method for fiber optic sensors with reactive, colorimetric claddings.  The coating process is characterized by a plasma cleaning and activation, followed by vapor deposition and curing of the reactive coating.  A variety of reagents can be incorporated into the cladding layer.  The reagents can be incorporated either as a guest or as a chemically bound reagent in a polymer matrix.  A secondary, non-reactive layer can also be deposited during the process.  In addition to providing increased durability and handling properties, this secondary layer may be used as a barrier layer for interfering compounds.  Phase I of this project will focus on coating optical fibers with a reactive cladding that uses p-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde as the reactive compound.  An acrylate derivative of p-Dimethylaminobezalddehyde will also be synthesized so that comparisons can be made between the \"guest-host\" claddings and the chemically bound claddings.  The fiber optic sensors will be tested in an absorbance mode and a phase-modulated mode.",

Emerging data communications standards such as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and Frame Relay are designed for multimedia data, but not for the severe fading that can occur on Over-the-Horizon (OTH) radio communications channels.  In order to permit the application of such standards on fading channels we propose a new technology, combining advanced modulation techniques, adaptive data rate, spread spectrum, and efficient data protocols in the physical layer.  The new technology is applied to a new class of light weight OTH radios much more cost-effective than current radios, and still ideally suited for a wide range of applications involving wireless multimedia data connectivity.  The cost effectiveness is achieved by technologies specifically aimed at applications with bursts data, such as computer data/file transfers, image transmission, and many other C4I applications. The proposed data link technology is also applicable to conventional data types such as digitized voice and video.   A study of the performance is proposed, including cost tradeoffs, optimization of parameters for high throughput and low error rate, and an investigation of the LPI/LPD performance.  The technology will be thoroughly tested with computer simulations.  A design of an OTH radio will be developed for the selected C4I application.  A prototype will be built, tested and demonstrated in Phase II.  Military Benefits: The proposed OTH radio system is a dual use technology.  It can be applied to a wide range of tactical military communications, such as intelligence data, digitized image transmission, remote medical care, digital map distribution, and database access.  It can also be applied to provide easier connections to command posts, radar sites, JTIDS ground stations, and between various mobile and fixed networks (SINCGARS, HAVEQUICK, etc.).",

        "abstract": "Advanced valved Group III elemental effusion cells for precise flux control in Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) systems will be developed and commercialized in the proposed project.  The sources are designed to be retrofittable to commercial MBE systems and compatible with flux (feedback) controlling instrumentation.  The cell design based upon adaptation of our existing (and patented) Vapor Transport Epitaxy (VTE) technology.  The principles of VTE, which uses valving to control fluxes and a hot manifold to control flux distribution, have been successfully applied to Ga, Al, In, Zn, Cd, Te, and Se to form multi-material systems such as InGaAs, AlGaAs, ZnSeTe and CdTe.  The development of the proposed single element sources is a logical extension of this existing VTE technology. In phase I, we will demonstrate precise flux control both temporally and spatially using a prototype valved effusion cell, which will be delivered to the contractor.  In Phase II , with our collaborators, we will develop commercial versions of the prototype cell for a variety of group III elements.  The refined cells will be evaluated in operational MBE systems.  We will also evaluate and package, as appropriate, other advanced designs in Phase II.  The continued direct marketing and sales of our valved group III effusion cells will comprise the Phase III effort.",

The proposed MSFA, which is synthetically designed using the neural filtering techniques to produce an optimal synthetic filtering scheme as opposed to the traditional analytic Kalman filtering approach, possesses the following attractive performance improvements: (1) it provides robust estimation in the presence of system uncertainties (e.g., mismatch between system and filter model, measurement noise variations, etc.); (2) it outperforms the extended Kalman filter and the iterated Kalman filter subject to nonlinearity; (3) it maintains target track when the target drastically changes its acceleration (target maneuverability variations); and (4) it provides a most suitable form for real-time filtering implementation in a radar tracker due to the massively parallel nature of the neural network filtering architecture. Design issues such as sampling rate, frequency of interest, and their related design criteria will also be investigated to insure that the proposed MSFA will produce improved estimation performance.",

Frequently, the measured properties of a multi-component system are very convoluted and identification of the systems components from the pure component measurements is non-trivial.  Many current chemometric methods of data fitting are not robust enough to handle complex data.  Problems with these methods include susceptibility to local minima trapping, not being applicable to nonlinear systems, and inability to constrain the produced results to a realistic range and not being able to handle data that falls outside the domain of previous data.  Thus, the global best fit for the system if often not found.  The proposed research overcomes all these problems through the use of a global search technique known as simulated annealing.  This technique has found wide use in optimization problems in many other fields but has seldomly been applied to data fitting problems.",

The overridingobjective is the development of new, highly reliably instrumentation that hassubstantially lower long term operating and maintenance costs than existinginstruments used in CEM applications.  The instrument approach to be developedand tested in Phase I and Phase II will be readily extended to measurement ofadditional gases, such as carbon monoxide and methane.  Detection limits for allgases will be 1 part per million or better in a measurement period of less than30 seconds.The Phase I/Phase II program will culminate in field testing of a prototype CEM.Key technical issues to be resolved during the program include:  1) optimizingsensitivity for detection of NO using a near-infrared diode laser, 2) decidingthe feasibility of using a single diode laser to detect both NO2 and O2, and3) verifying the effectiveness of their proposed low-cost, fully automated, self-calibration method.",

        "abstract": "Computers and hardware simulators are currently used to test the response of on-board aircraft radars and electronic warfare (EW) systems within the confines of shielded ancehoic chambers.  Histori cally, most laboratory tests of these systems have used direct injection of the simulated radar returns and/or threat signals into the receivers of the system under test.  RF anechoic chamber test facilities now favor large matrices of broadband antennas (0.5-18 GHz) to dynamically simulate apparent targets locations or to generate complex RF environments.  Off-the-shelf broadband antennas are expensive, lack suitable controllability for dynamic simulation, and exhibit high radar cross section (RCS).  These characteristics degrade the anechoic properties of the chamber and create electromagnetic interactions with the aircraft under test.  There is a requirement for the development of a low-cost broadband antenna suitable for antenna matrices or arrays required in RF anechoic chambers.  SR proposes to meet this requirement by researching and synthesizing a low-cost controllable antenna for use in a large array within anechoic test chambers.",

One cost-effective response to this requirement is the increasing use of both computer and hardware simulation to test the response of US radar, EW, CNI, IFF, and datalink systems to different threats and engagement scenarios. These simulations are conducted in shielded anechoic chambers and typically sue direct injection of the RF threat signal bypassing the antenna of the system under test.  However, testing of advanced integrated avionics systems with conformal arrays and shared apertures requires non disruptive radiated techniques.  One such technique is to install a large antenna array on the wall of the anechoic chamber to dynamically simulate targets.  This approach requires hundreds of antennas and components, is very expensive and takes years to implement.  There is a need for developing a non disruptive system of radiated RF coupling to augment the direct injection and wall mounted array techniques. S*R proposes to meet this requirement with a multipurpose over-the-antenna \"hat\" RF coupler capable of simulating dynamic angles of arrival for multiple targets and operating in a transmit or high power density receive mode.",

        "abstract": "Prior IR&D work by Spectro Dynamic Systems (SDS) and others demonstrated that silver coated cenospheres (SCC) 1) provide a unique pigment for achieving low emissivity coatings, and 2) can be modified to achieve microwave compatibility with little or no loss of low emissivity properties.  This proposal will combine this unique low emissive, microwave transparent pigment with a high performance, low VOC coating that matches a medium shade gray visual color.  Key parameters to be studied in Phase I include the amount of silver on the cenospheres, the size of the cenospheres, and methods for separating individual spheres in the coating to improve microwave transparency.  Coating formulations will include high solids, two-component urethanes and reactive water-base systems. To optimize the appropriate low VOC coatings and provide color matching capabilities, SDS will employ, as a subcontractor, BBM Technologies, Inc., whose personnel have many combined years experience in formulating pigmented and environmentally compliant coatings.  At the conclusion of Phase I, this program will demonstrate the suitability of SDS materials as a true multi-spectral environmentally compliant coating suitable for Air Force platform applications.  Several key variables for control of properties will be quantified, including the correlations between IR reluctance, microwave transparency, and visual camouflage.",

The future of InP based electronics depends greatly on reducing phosphine consumption and associated reactive waste byproducts from the process. Increasingly stringent environment and safety regulations on hazardous materials are putting greater liability and cost pressures on corporations involved wit InP and III-V's in general, jeopardizing the future of these materials.  Phase I will demonstrate the viability for a very high pressure MOCVD reaction chamber operating at ten atmospheres, growing InP at very low V:III ratios; current ratios range up to 2000:1.  The chamber will be configured as a vertical, inverted flow design to minimize convection.  A gas booster will be incorporated at the inlet to allow operation at ten atmospheres.  In Phase II, the chamber developed in Phase I will be scaled up for four-inch diameter wafers and integrated into one of Spire's InP production reactors used for an expanding InP based commercial epi sales market.",

Preliminary results clearly demonstrated superior quality B-SiC grown on ultrathin (about 300A) Si on SiO2, compared to that grown under identical conditions on standard SIMOX (with a thickness of 2000A) or on bulk Si.  Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron diffraction, and RBS/channeling studies indicated the growth of epitaxial single-crystal SiC on ultrathin Si on Si02  while results from standard SIMOX indicated the growth of polycrystalline SiC and single crystal sic. our results indicate that a uniform and high integrity thin Si top layer is necessary for successful growth of good quality SiC films.  During etching of thick SOI, threading dislocation defects are converted to pinholes thus the buried oxide is depleted.  We have already demonstrated the fabrication of ultrathin Si, as thin as 140A on SiO2 by using the LES (20 to 30 keV) process to produce low-cost films of excellent integrity compared to thinned commercial SIMOX.      Based on these results, ultrathin Si-on-insulator substrates appear to have great potential for producing SiC films suitable as substrates for device quality GaN films.",

This can be a severe problem in high performance military or civil aircraft with high gain feedbacks in the system.  The conventional approach to this problem is to use notch filters, but the resulting additional phase lags can give rise to difficulties in meeting the low frequency pilot handling quality requirements.  The proposal describes the concept for a novel approach to the problem that could lead to a significant advance in treatment of structural mode interaction, without the adverse effects on handling qualities. The proposed work program is to conduct a theoretical evaluation using representative aircraft data, including an assessment of the robustness of the approach with data uncertainties.  An initial specification and design of a laboratory test rig is planned, which would be used for a practical evaluation of the techniques in a Phase II program.  The technology and algorithms resulting from research into the concept should form a product that can be exploited commercially.",

        "abstract": "Pure copper is widely used in industry as a stabilizing material in superconducting wires.  Copper posseses excellent thermal and electrical properties.  It is mechanically compatible with NbTi superconducting filaments relatively inexpensive and provides sufficient stabilization of a standard under normal operating conditions.  Copper stabilizers can routinely provide RRR values (resistance measured at room temperature/resistance at 10 K) as high as 200 or even 300 in some cases.  These values are suitable for most applications, however, magnets operating under exceptional conditions benefit significantly from higher RRR values in a stabilizing element. Supercon, Inc. proposes to investigate commercially viable techniques to clad a NbTi superconducting wire with high purity aluminum as the stabilizing element.  Aluminum offers high RRR values (4000+ in commercially available aluminum), light weight and good thermal conductivity.  These properties allow superconducting magnets to be conductively cooled using cryocoolers to eliminate the need for liquid helium.  These developments will introduce the application of superconducting technology in remote locations where liquid helium may not be available. The Phase I program will investigate and evaluate two existing cladding techniques.  The best process will be selected based on several criteria with tooling and machine modification designs completed in Phase I. The program objective is to develop the capacity to clad a wide range of wire sizes.",

        "abstract": "New technologies are desired to develop low-cost and easily applied paint coatings for thermal signature control of Air Force applications.  The coating must be compatible with existing visible and microwave specifications, be applicable to a variety of substrates, and meet mechanical and environmental requirements.  Constructing tailored IR pigments using then film interference filter has proved successful for a number of applications.  The drawbacks are :  high cost, glossy finish, and angular variability. Development the capability to construct thin film interference filter pigments on hollow glass micro-sphere substrates would have a number of advantages:  the pigment design would be based on evaluating paint (pigment/binder/sub-surface) performance using standard Air Force binders, hollow-spherical pigments would float to the surface, minimizing binder absorption and produce a diffuse surface finish, the pigment could be constructed using low-cost CAD techniques.  This proposal is to develop a proof-of-concept CVD coating facility to deposit thin film interference filter coatings on hollow micro-sphere pigments.  Surface Optics Corporation has unique analytical design tools for developing these pigments, and in-house vacuum coating equipment that will be adapted for this program. The Phase II program would produce prototype quantities of a selected paint system.",

The study specifically addresses acoustically induced vibration in an airborne optical train.  Two approaches will be studied.  (1) The first approach is to inertially instrument each optical element, sensing the motion causing optical jitter.  The array of vibration measurements are used with a robust feedback control law and with an adaptive feed forward algorithm to precisely cancel the optical jitter.  (2) The second approach is to adapt an SVS active sound barrier concept to the airborne problem.  The active sound barrier uses a combination of feed back and adaptive feed forward control to attenuate the sound passing through the barrier.  For both approaches, robust control will be applied to the multiple input, multiple output feed back problem.  Also advanced techniques of multiple input, multiple output adaptive feed forward control will be evaluated. Performance improvements will be determined using acoustic simulation.  Cost for the various approaches will be developed. Based on the risk, cost, and performance benefits, a proof of concept experiment will be defined for the Phase II effort.",

        "abstract": "A Vehicle Real-time Attitude Estimation System (VRAES) is proposed which will use existing real-time tracking systems and proven software for object detection, outlining, and feature extraction. Using generalized shape parameters obtained during the detection and feature extraction processing, a subset of outline filters from a large bank of prestored object outlines will be selected.  These will then be compared with the observed object outline to determine identity and orientation.  A proven real-time tracking system will be used to provide complete closed loop tracking.  The proposed system will perform primary data reduction and orientation estimation at each sensor.  In this model, each sensor can operate independently, and if two or more sensors are available, the resulting data will be communicated over a low bandwidth link to a central processor which will resolve attitude ambiguities and triangulate the target position in 3-space.  The proposed system is low risk because it draws heavily on existing and proven subsystems.  The core processing software for object detection, outlining, feature extraction, and frame-to-frame correlation is the Optical Signature Extraction Pipeline (OSEP) developed at MIT Lincoln Laboratory and used to extract position and signature information from infra-red data collected at White Sands Missile Range.  Missions analyzed include STORM BTTV 5, 6, and 7.  If closed-loop tracking is used, the Opti-Trak 100 real-time tracker will be used.  This system, originally developed as the Air Force Advanced Modular Tracker has been installed and used at a number of sites, including Malabar Tracking Station and AMOS.

SVS has developed a data acquisition system which currently accomplishes many of the requirements set forth within this SBIR task.  A thorough review of specifications would be required to determine design changes necessary to meet the customer's requirements.  The major technical problems associated with minimizing data band-width, insuring synchronous counter latching, and time multiplexing the data into telemetry signals have been solved.

This Phase I SBIR transfers an Air Force high energy laser design code (System Optical Quality), imaging and sensors technologies to demonstrate computer aided diagnoses (CAD) of cancer and pulmonary embolism. CAD is a diagnosis made by human expert who takes into account the results of computerized analysis of medical images and uses the results as the second opinion in detecting cancers and classifying images; the final diagnosis is made by a physician.  The CAD second opinion enables a physician to take a second look to minimize missed diagnoses, which delay treatment and results in unnecessary procedures (and costs).  Team member Frederick Datz, MD, a director at the University of Utah Medical School and practitioner at the Veterans Administration Medical Center says, \"CAD could serve as a 'second opinion' allowing less experience or specialized radiologists to read radionuclide studies.  Even if an expert screens the studies, second reading by another expert has been shown to significantly reduce the number of false-negative studies. Our system would serve as a more cost effective technique than using a second expert.  CAD is of DUAL USE because bone a prostate cancers affect most Veterans.  Pulmonary embolism and breast cancer are often misdiagnosed; over 20% of cases.  The reason for the misdiagnoses are multiple and include simple explanations such as high volume, tiredness, eye fatigues and oversight.  CAD will be sufficiently accurate to serve as a second opinion to a physician. In Phase II CAD will be adapted for use on a low-cost, high speed reconfigurable Medical Image and Information Processor, MIIP.  MIIP is a hardware system using spatial light modulators that operate in the MHz range.  Phase II CAD diagnoses a variety of conditions including breast and testicular cancer.",

        "abstract": "Antijam protection for GPS receivers can be provided in a cost-effective way by restricting the antenna reception to the upper hemisphere only, thereby eliminating the majority of intentional and unintentional jamming sources in either a war- fighting context or terrorist attack scenario. Competing schemes using null- steering antennas or receiver/processor improvements are not cost effective and do not offer good performance capability against multiple noise jammers emitting random wideband signals from multiple geographic locations. The proposed System Planning Corporation (SPC) antenna approach would be a Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) Preplanned Product Improvement (P31) candidate. It would keep available the desired circular polarization coverage over an adaptable sector of the upper hemisphere (excluding the horizon) and significantly reduce unintentional coverage of the lower hemisphere provided by conventional antennas. This would be achieved by providing an adaptable beamwidth for the upper hemisphere and significantly reducing sidelobes/backlobes in the lower hemisphere. Novel techniques for electronic control of the beamwidth and reduction of missile excitation using contoured corrugated surfaces near the aperture are the key proposed enabling approaches. Improvements in jammer-to-signal performance of greater than 20 dB are expected for horizon and lower hemisphere jammer locations.",

Many of these new systems require a rethinking of Army and Joint doctrines, operational control methods and techniques, and means of communications.  Little has been done to make available the latest state-of-the-art (SOA) technologies for the operational control of those missile systems.  Some exotic missile system operational control technologies are available that are Off-The-Shelf (OTS). The new OTS technologies possess the potential to provide opportunities of new operational control methods of firing doctrine, battlefield surveillance, intelligence collection, target acquisition, target identification, and battlefield assessment.  Our approach is to use the Army System Engineering and Analysis methodology in the review, analysis, assessment, and formulations of Missile System Operational Control Doctrine and concepts in the development functional requirements.  The review and engineering analysis will include all known OTS command and control systems technologies and the feasibility of applying them to the operational control of new and existing smart missile systems. Some of the problems that will be addressed are; How do these systems and concepts fit into the Army Moderation Program during the four phases of combat?  Are there sufficient control assets?  Is there a need for changes in doctrine?  Who, what, where, and how do these systems fit into the Army Tactical Command and Control Systems architecture? (ATACCS)  Can OTS technologies be used to improve the effectiveness of controlling these systems?  What new or additional control/intelligence and surveillance methods or new equipment are necessary to fulfill Army doctrine?",

The array feed has been identified to be one of the most promising areas for applying innovative architectures to achieve low cost and reduced size and weight.  AU potential architectural approaches will be subjected to a multi-level systems engineering screening process.  Each architecture will be ranked, with low cost approaches which show strong potential for commercial applications, receiving the highest consideration.  For architectures that pass the second level of screening, the following will be assessed: 1) the potential for commercial application, 2) the potential impact on T/R module design and interface requirements, and 3) the requirements for new multi-technology electronics modules which may be required at the subarray or column level This effort will provide preliminary plans and recommendations for a follow-on demonstration.",

In addition the control system will be specifically designed to meet manual control requirements of the crane operator and to provide options for further automation of cargo handling.

Used individually, or in combination the PemRAM and ASTM subsystems will meet the need for real world energy expenditure while remaining within a fixed reference frame.  Instrumented boots will provide six-degree-of-freedom inputs into the LocoSim controller (PC workstation).  Environmental (i.e. terrain and obstacle) inputs to the LocoSim will be obtained from currently existing DIS-compatible virtual environment systems.  The controller will then issue control signals to each PemRAM actuator, thus insuring that real-world motion and energy expenditure is achieved.  If the trainee moves correctly, he/she will traverse the simulated terrain; if not, they will become stuck!  The ASTM subsystem provides crawling and climbing additions to the basic walking/running PemRAM-supported actions.  Our design permits the utilization of either Helmet Mounted Display (HMD) or CAVE (Cave Audio Visual Environment) visual immersion system.  Our LocoSim is designed to be DIS-compatible.

The acoustic signature measurement capability of Army ground combat vehicles can be significantly improved by using beamforming techniques to continuously measure the received signal during signature-gathering encounters (i.e., real-time signature acquisition and characterization).  An 8-channel microphone array with proper signal conditioning and analysis tools can measure the continuous directivity of incoming threat vehicles.  This program will design and develop a real-=time array-based beamforming system that will be targeted for combat vehicle platforms.  The beam-forming system that is to be analyzed and developed in Phase I will have the capability to null out all acoustic interference from sources such as generators, stationary vehicles, etc.  This program will take existing Government-developed software used for beamforming and classification and adapt it to the beamforming system as directivity measurement tools.  It will also incorporate a mature tracking algorithm using the lines-of-bearing to the target to determine target position and velocity.  The SYTRONICS/IITRI Team will deliver a UNIX-based \"C\" and MATLAB software analysis system which will run on a SUN Workstation and allow the user to run previously collected acoustic emission data and test various configurations for directivity analysis.

The subject code is \"seeded\" with errors, then run against the test cases.  By judicious selection of errors, failures of the test set to detect the seeded errors will lead to test set extensions or corrections that will reveal previously undetected bugs in the original code.  Mutation analysis has been shown to be effective, but it has not found widespread acceptance in the software engineering community. We believe this is due to inadequate research on and attention to technology transition issues.  We therefore propose a two-pronged approach to mutation analysis:  research and development of the core technology, and complimentary research of appropriate technology transition concerns, e.g., the relationship of mutation analysis to static and dynamic analyses, interoperability requirements, user goals and perceived needs, etc.  An object-oriented analysis and design specifying a mutation analysis tool will be performed and documented.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this work is to develop a small, reliable, low cost pulsed fiber optic laser.  The fiber will be rare-earth doped and will deliver pulses of several megawatts with a width of ten nanoseconds.  Fiber optic communications has already stimulated the development of low power cw fiber lasers and high power fiber amplifiers.  In this proposal, we present an approach to use fiber lasers in a high power pulsed mode.  We will use a double clad fiber configuration because it is currently the most promising design for high power fiber lasers.  We will focus our efforts on Nd3+ doped silica fibers because this combination achieves the highest output power at the present time.  However, we will experiment with different fiber materials and rare-earth dopings, as well as optimize the length of the fiber for each combination.  Because the projected peak output power is in the range of megawatts, damage thresholds of the different materials have to be investigated.  To generate pulses in the ten nanosecond range we propose using a KD*P modulator for Q-switching.  The end mirrors can be formed by dielectric coatings on the fiber ends or UV induced fiber-gratings.  A high power fiver optic laser with integrated Q-switch will have several advantages over solid state lasers consisting of bulk optical elements:  The coupling of the pump light is simpler and the cooling of the active material is more efficient, because of the bigger surface to volume ratio in the fiber.  Therefore, thermal lensing is reduced and fundamental mode operation is possible over a wide power range.",

Our unique approach will use novel, polymeric switches and electro-optical modulators together with a 1550 nm source and optical fiber amplifiers and fiber delay lines.  The use of polymer switches and modulators provides not only very large bandwidth modulation but also fast switching time with low insertion loss and high isolation.  The nonlinear optical polymers provide devices with large electro-optic coefficients, small dispersion, larger frequency response, and greater fabrication flexibility compared to titanium indiffused LiNbO(3) or GaAs waveguide technology.  Various types of polymer-based modulators and switches with optical fiber amplifiers will be considered in Phase I for applications to programmable fiber-optic delay line networks and device development in Phase II.  A prototype switch will be constructed and tested for a feasibility demonstration of the use of advanced nonlinear polymer materials for optical modulation and signal processing during an option task to Phase I. The use of polymer materials will provide improved frequency response (potentially to 100 GHz), fast switching speed, larger electro-optic effect, lower cost, and greater manufacturing flexibility.",

        "abstract": "In this proposal, a novel method of detecting emissions from combustion systems using silicon carbide photodiodes is presented. Silicon carbide (SiC) photodiodes are responsive in the ultra-violet (UV) regime of the optical spectrum due to the wide band-gap characteristics of silicon carbide.  These same characteristics allow SiC semiconductor devices to operate at temperatures up to 600K, rendering it especially useful for harsh environments such as combustion systems and aircraft engine exhaust systems.  In the proposed work, SiC photodiodes will be used as sensitive emission detectors for combustion species such as hydroxyl (OH), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitric oxide (NO, NOx). The feasibility of using these sensors as emission detectors in jet engine exhaust plumes for fleet maintenance will also be demonstrated.  The validity of the proposed concept will be demonstrated by comparing the SiC detection technique with standard laser based diagnostic measurements of the above combustion species.  The use of the SiC photodiode for on-line combustion control will also be demonstrated in a laboratory environment.  Due to small size and high temperature compatibility, the silicon carbide photodiode is ideal for on-line control applications.",

Membrane fouling is the single most important critical problem facing the application of membrane processes to wastewater renovation.  This method will maintain near initial membrane flux during the lifecycle of the processs, and subsequently would decrease the size of a treatment system as a result of increased produciton per square foot of membrane surface area.  This method would not involve the use of additives or mechanical devices.  Biostatic and biocidal agents used for reduction or elimination of biofouling can leak out or evaporate out while in the \"laid up\" membrane-based system.  Other cleaning methods for other types of fouling tend to interfere with the operation of the system.  The feasibility of the proposed method will be evaluated in comparison with currently employed methods.  A final design will be provided for implementation and demonstration of a bench-scale membrane-based wastewater treatment process.",

        "abstract": "The crew of direct fire weapon systems in an active fire fight are subject to information overload and conflicting priorities, particularly in a target-rich environment.  Such parameters as distance to target, immediacy of threat, target value assessment (TVA), lethality against a specific target type, slew angle required to engage, and type of round in the tube may all be factors in selecting which of several targets to engage, even when operating independently.  Additional factors in coordinated attacks/defense include sectors of responsibility, target-firer designation from external control, situation awareness based upon intel, and maneuver objectives of the force may further complicate the selection and order of engagement.  Tracking airborne and ground-based targets using video or FLIR-based autotrackers in a combat environment is a complex and difficult task.  A number of factors contribute to the difficulty, including intentional employment of camouflage and masking techniques, presence of battlefield obscurant including aerosols and dust, contrast reversals because of illumination angles or background changes, detection/tracking requirements at extreme ranges resulting in both small object size and potential atmospheric turbulence effects, target geometries and dynamics relative to the observing tracker, including high-speed cross range engagements and partially obscured targets, periodic momentary obscuration by physical objects (clumps of trees, clouds, terrain LOS), intentional use of clutter (chaff, flares), and other interfering conditions.  A successful autotracker must compensate for many of these conditions through robust operation using changes in tracking strategies and algorithms based upon the tracking environment.  A requirement exists for an aid to the crew that will optimize the target selection process based upon dynamically changeable criteria, perform the fire control function once the recommended target selection is accepted, and actively track and perform TVA on additional targets for subsequent engagement, using a state-of-the-art video tracker.  Additionally the aid should perform target damage assessment on the target being engaged, rec",

Correction algorithms for near-field measurements have been developed to compensate for probe position errors. Many new materials are available to reduce structural weight and RF reflectivity. High speed workstations can acquire and process tremendous amounts of data in real-time. TSC proposes to leverage these advancements in the design of a semi-portable antenna near-field scanner. This \"Robo-Scanner\" will be capable of making rapid RF performance measurements and diagnostic evaluations of radar and communications antennas in the field and in maintenance depots. It will automatically locate the antenna aperture and accurately scan its probe antenna over a pre-determined surface of arbitrary geometry. The Robo-Scanner will provide a measurement and diagnostic capability in the field which now exists only in engineering laboratories and factories. Its availability will simplify maintenance of radar and communication systems and insure that these systems are operating at full performance. It will save the cost of dismantling the antenna and returning it to the factory for measurement and repair.",

The Phase I SBIR objective is to design an IR scene generator for prototyping demonstration in BAC during Phase II.  In Phase I, we will first establish requirements for the models, software and hardware that comprise the scene generator that meets the Phage I objective.  Second, we will assess the adequacy of the current state of the industry to satisfy these requirements. Third, we will develop the necessary techniques to meet the Phase I objective in those areas where current capabilities are inadequate. Finally, we will develop a design methodology and the design for the prototype scene generator. TSC has built imaging IR scene generators and IR simulators for interactive testing of installed IR sensors.

A key element in achieving the goals of this vision is the concept of deep integration of avionics sensor suites for navigation and weapon delivery.  The architecture which enables this function is a Geometric Vector (GV).  This is a 10 element vector which optimally processes geometric information from all on-board and off-board sensors to provide the best possible estimate of position, velocity, attitude and time.  The technical objectives of the SBIR program are to identify military aircraft missions whose performance would be enhanced by a GV, to identify candidate avionics sensors and the quality of the geometric data each provides, and to define the architectural structure to generate the GV.  The proposed program will focus on F-15E, F-16, F-22 and JAST missions and functions.  Each of the sensors in the existing or proposed avionics suites will be evaluated.  Detailed analyses of radar contributions to the GV including Synthetic Aperture processing will be performed.  Existing navigation simulations utilizing both error covariance and Monte Carlo approaches will be evaluated and modifications to derive the GV will be identified. Mission effectiveness enhancement using GV will be demonstrated.",

If the necessary realism and fidelity require processes beyond a direct transfer, we anticipate that the following innovative IR conversion techniques will be required: developing a pixel-based IR radiance model using both material type and environmental conditions as input to the model, and developing a material type extractor from the source imagery operating with either commercial classifiers or new, TSC-developed algorithms. TSC will assess the feasibility of developing and integrating these conversion techniques into the IR scene generator.

        "abstract": "The growing threat to Navy ships from low flyers, coupled with the increasing importance of brown watery, littoral, scenarios in Navy planning, heightens the need for high fidelity propagation modeling.  Such modeling is essential not only to the understanding of ship's sensors performance, but also for the assessment of threat behavior - e.g., RF missile seekers. Traditional propagation models used within the Navy community are valid only for a standard atmosphere, and homogeneous sea environment.  New propagation models, which account for terrain and non-standard propagation conditions are far more complex and computationally intensive. To overcome the throughput hurdle within the context of real-time sensor/environment simulations, TSC is proposing to extend an existing interpolative scheme.  It is supported by the off-line generation of mass stored propagation databases using existing high fidelity models.  During a simulation run, propagation is modeled via interpolation algorithms relative to a database segment loaded into random access memory during initialization. This approach can bring high fidelity propagation modeling, under any environmental condition, into the real-time simulation world.  It will also decouple the on-line simulation software from the propagation models specifics.",

An electrical discharge based acoustic source has many of the advantages of an explosive source with the elimination of a number of the disadvantages. The proposed Underwater Pulsed Acoustic Source (UPAS) removes the remaining disadvantages of explosive sources and gives the Navy true high intensity impulse capability. The proposed technology will provide low frequency, broadband, impulses with precise timing, multiple ping capability, and coded output.

More extensive usage of bumper systems can potentially save millions of dollars annually in repair costs to these structures.  However, in order to successfully accomplish this, the unit cost of bumper systems must be reduced. Cost reductions in bumper manufacturing can be gained through both raw material and process choices.  Because the stresses that bumpers must endure are significant, material candidates will be screened based on both mechanical and environmental performance.  One cost saving factor that will be heavily investigated is the use of recycled raw materials.  These will potentially include all components including foam, resins, and reinforcements.

        "abstract": "Elastomeric O-rings provide a critical sealing funcion in a myriad of devices of military and commerical interest. A critical problem with currently available O-rings occurs when the O-ring material stiffens at low temperatures, causing a failure in sealing. Previous work by the Army has indicated that a fluid filled O-ring is a viable candidate as a low temperature seal. There is a need to extend this work so that the O-ring will maintain a good low temperature seal and be able to tolerate the high temperatures generated by some applications.  In the proposed effort, Texas Research Institute Austin (TRI/Austin) will identify, fabricate, and test different elastomeric skins andliquied cores during the design of a prototype liquid filled O-ring. In order to identify state of the art polymeric materials not currently available in commerical O-rings, TRI/Austin will team with McGahan NuSil, Inc., who are experts in silicones, fluorosilicones and other sealing materials.  During the Phase I effort, we propose to investigate and characterize a number of elastomeric materials and liquid filings under high and low tmeprature conditions and examine the interaction between the elastomeric envelope and the liquid filler during the O-ring design process.",

High part counts lead to concern about T/R module reliability and improvements in semiconductor device manufacturing techniques and materials technology make lifetime performance data difficult and expensive to acquire.  Accelerated life testing (ALT) provides a means by which reliability may be characterized in a compressed time frame. TRI/Austin will collect mission profile data for T/R modules, from which an ALT will be designed using theoretical aging models and analysis of service life failure mechanisms.  Finite element analysis will be carried out for materials that are used in T/R module designs; stresses imposed by environmental and operational conditions will be estimated.  Thermal analysis techniques will be used to investigate thermal aging effects for selected materials.  Component-level GaAs test articles will be subjected to thermal cycling, and the cycles to failure will be recorded for varying test article configurations. Results will be compared with FEA and theoretical predictions. Nondestructive evaluation will reveal the presence of cracking or other GaAs failures, and several NDE techniques will be examined for applicability to failure detection in GaAs semiconductor designs.",

A number of military firing ranges are in danger of being closed due to high levels of lead contamination.  TRI/Austin proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of developing a non-toxic, lead free, cost effective, injection molded projectile core made from a high density powder metal alloy combined with a state-of-the-art polymer binder.  Compatible polymer binders with excellent adhesion will be determined by using a unique method to characterize the surface charge or zeta potential of the metallic particle surface.  The powder metal alloy-polymer core will have a density similar to a lead core and will perform ballistically like a lead core.  Polymer binders such as polyetherimide, polypthalimide, nylon 6,6 nylon 11 and nylon 12 will be mixed with a metal alloy such as tungsten-copper for injection molding.  Degradation additives will be investigated to accelerate the polymer binder's degradation once the projectile core is spent.",

A worldwide information search will be conducted, focusing on NDE technique for determining crack size, orientation, and location, and NDE techniques for in-situ material toughness evaluation.    Special emphasis will be placed on Acoustic Emission (AE) and ultrasonic techniques, which will be investigated both in the literature and in the laboratory.     A technology synthesis will be performed to select NDE methods applicable to the crane problem.   Prototype laboratory tools will be developed and tested to prove the feasibility of the approach.

        "abstract": "A variety of recent technical developments, especially in lightweight equipment for navigation and communications, has created opportunity for long-range autonomous operations by aircraft of remarkably small size. Aircraft weighing less than 15 kg can now carry avionics and fuel sufficient for missions of several thousand kilometres and several days duration, at altitudes from sea level to perhaps as high as 15 km. Their payload, while small, will accommodate many applications in meteorology, and in other areas of earth and atmospheric science. Moreover their low cost should stimulate use on a wide scale. The Insitu Group began developing such aircraft in 1992. We call them aerosondes because our focus has been on measurements comparable to those made by meteorological radiosondes. Three prototypes have been built, and the components necessary for long-range autonomous missions have been demonstrated. Work is continuing on an initial operational version of the aircraft, with the objective of starting service trials in November 1995. The Marine Meteorology program of ONR, in association with the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, has sponsored this work from an early stage. Further support is being provided by the USAF Office of Scientific Research. Here we propose a vital component of the program which is not fully funded as yet: namely, development of the meteorological sensing techniques (ie those for pressure, temperature, humidity, and horizontal wind components). The Phase I work would be completed in time for November 1995 field trials. Phase II would encompass enhancement of the instrumentation set as well as extensive long-range operations. These would include tropical cyclone reconnaissance and coastal monitoring, which have been principal objectives of ONR sponsorship to date.",

The Phase I effort will result in the development of an object- oriented, user friendly, visual software application integrating shipboard system representations and first-principles system assessment algorithms.  Use of the commercially available object-oriented application development environment called JSpace   will provide for the seamless integration of the ship system information and the system assessment methodologies.  To accomplish the Phase I efforts, we have formed a strong team of The SURVICE Engineering Company - a system engineering and visual computing firm - and Mr. Robert Barr - 44 years of ship design and assessment experience.

TIBURON's background in the development of currently deployed TOMAHAWK command/control systems in conjuction with the coordination/interfacing with TOMAHAWK weapon systems will serve as the basis of understanding of the strengths and deficiencies of current and near-term mission/TCI accountability schemes.  The primary goal of this project will be to identify algorithms and schemas for establishing and maitaining end user TCI accountability with multiple systems cohabiting on a virtual network.  Subordinate goals to the primary goal are identification of (1) the TCI user community's information requirements and (2) their appropriate paths over both the GLOBIXS and TADIXS networks, along with (3) a projection of the network loading for the TCI data, and (4) the identification of security requirements associated with the distribution of TCI data on these networks.  To support the design tradeoffs and requirements analysis of the algorithms/schemes for establishing/maintaining TCI accountability, and network bandwidth requirements for TCI data, TIBURON proposes to develop a GLOBIXS/TADIXS network simulation mode.  Additionally, analysis and tradeoff studies will be performed in Phase I in support of achieving all Phase I goals, which will be summarized in the Phase I Final Report.",

(TLC) has a very aggressive plan for becoming a leading manufacturer and supplier of epitaxial GaAs and InP-based wafers for military and commercial applications. Key to our strategy is to identify, develop, and be the first at market with those advanced semiconductor materials that offer clear cost and performance advantages for high speed/low power applications.  We strongly believe that the complementary GaAs heterostructure field effect transistor (CHFET) technology is such a materials system.  Even though recent progress has been made toward LSI circuit levels, materials/device issues must be further optimized to realize the full potential of this technology.  The key issues to optimize are (i) threshold voltage control for both the n- and p-channel FETs, (ii) increased p-channel FET transconductance and, (iii) reduced gate leakage of the FETs.  Of the three issues stated above, only the gate leakage issue can not be optimized with the current structure.  The \"insulating\" Al(sub0.75)Ga(sub0.25)As layer can not be made any more resistive under the current growth conditions.  TLC has detailed plans for modifying the standard CHFET structure by replacing the Al(sub0.75)Ga(sub0.25)As layer with an MBE-grown GaN layer which has intrinsically greater insulating properties.",

Specific improvements include a 5-fold increase in compressive strength, greater corrosion resistance over traditional cement-based patching materials.  The current limitation of pozzolanic cements is slow reaction time leading to uneconomically long cure times.  TPL proposes to accelerate the cementatious reaction mechanism through low temperature hydrothermal synthesis of more chemically active nano-sized starting materials.  Smaller starting materials will have the added advantage of reducing porosity and increasing compressive strength and corrosion resistance in the cured product.  The hydrothermal synthesis route to production of cementatious starting materials will have significant energy saving over traditional portland cement calcination procedures which require temperatures of 1400 C. Characterization of fabricated patch materials will be via XRD, SEM, and porosimetry.  Selected compositions will undergo compaction via hydrostatic pressure to assess effect on mechanical properties.  Compressive strength, temperature cycling, and scaling resistance will complete the properties screening.",

        "abstract": "Operation of heavy equipment results in the generation of high sound levels.  These sounds (exhaust from diesel or turbine engines, clatter of vehicle parts and cargo, movement of joints, etc.), when taken together result in a characteristic acoustic signature.  Depending on terrain and environmental conditions this sound may carry several kilometers.  This unintentional noise offers an opportunity for tactical exploitation.  A variety of information can be extracted from the acoustic signature including relative bearing, course, speed, and vehicle type. Providing this information to field commanders would provide an invaluable aid to mission performance.  Use of beamforming techniques for signal collection allows several advantages over other techniques including formation of many independent beams, refocusing without physical movement, and interference control.  The extensive information content in the acoustic signature can be extracted using pattern classification techniques such as neural networks.  Using beamforming and pattern classification techniques, a Phase I program is proposed that will analyze acoustic signature information to generate detailed target related information.  The proposed efforts would implement and deliver a signal exploitation system providing field commanders with acoustic target bearing tracking and vehicle identification information and support operator signal analysis by means of a set of signal analysis tools.",

        "abstract": "The goal of this project is to shorten the generation interval (GI) in cattle by developing efficient methods for collection of developmentally competent oocytes from the ovaries of prepuberal heifers.  The methods could then be offered as a service to our clients.  Genetics gains are being limited by the length of the GI, inefficiencies in new reproductive technologies, and the low rates of selection intensity of dams in production herds.  Multiple ovulation and embryo transfer (MOET) programs and transvaginal ultrasonically guided ovum pick-up (OPU) throughout the estrous cycle have been used to increase the selection intensity of dams.  The variability of superovulation and low rates of development of the embryos has limited the number of offspring produced and has had little impact on the GI.  Collection of oocytes from prepuberal heifers offers the best method for decreasing the GI but lack of developmental competence of the oocytes limits its use.  A more complete understanding of the temporal changes occurring in the nucleus and ooplasm during oocyte growth, maturation, fertilization and early development is essential to development of this technology.  The aim of the proposed studies is to develop efficient methods for collection of oocytes from the ovaries of gonadotrophin-stimulated prepuberal heifers by comparing effects of superovulatory treatments and the effect of donor age on cellular and functional changes occurring during maturation and IVMFC.  The information obtained will be used as the basis for developing new and innovative methods for increasing the efficiency of superovulation and in vitro technologies applicable to bovine oocytes and embryos.",

However, this immunization protocol may not always be practical, especially for Army personnel in the field or in remote areas where access to the health care personnel may be difficult.  Our program is based on the concept of complete immunization (prime and boosting) with a single oral vaccine dosage form using a time-release capsule - \"protected\" biodegradable nanoparticles (polyactic-polyglycolic acid) containing staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB)-toxoid as a model protein-based antigen.  thus, the nanoparticles will be enclosed in a protective time-release capsule known as the PORT System.  The capsule is deigned to protect nanoparticles and the encapsulated antigen from both gastric enzymes and acidic pH, and to release the enclosed antigen loaded nanoparticles in a burst in the ileum for optimal uptake by the gut-associated lymphoid tissue to induce an immune response.  No other group has investigated this concept of capsule \"protected\" nanoparticles.  Our working hypothesis is that by virtue of our smaller particle size (nanoparticles Vs. previous microparticles), and enteric protection using the PORT System, our oral vaccination approach will prove significantly better than those studied previously.  Our goal in the Phase I-SBIR program is to test the feasibility of this concept of oral immunization using SEB-toxoid to achieve an immune response comparable to that of the conventional method of subcutaneous immunization.  The long-term objective of our program in the Phase II-SBIR is to further develop our nanoparticle-vaccine system in a time-release capsule for a singel-dose oral SEB vaccine adminsitration in a clinical trial. Nanoparticle-vaccine development will involve the formulation in Phase II-SBIR of various staged booster doses can e simply given orally in a single contact encounter.  Ultimately this system may be useful for a combination of vaccines to achieve a long-term protective immune response against vaccine-preventable diseases. Such a system will have importance to US Armed forces in the field,",

This laser will be capable of delivering high energy pulses for heating & chemical activation, as well as low power pulses for sensing and interrogation.  The laser will include a fiber optic beam delivery system and hardware for sensing interrogation pulse returns.  U.S. Laser will modify a laser head from its line of commercially available pulsed industrial lasers to feature a unique hybrid diode-flashlamp pumping scheme.  The laser will operate in both high and low power pulsed modes, with independent control of high and low power operation.  U.S. Laser will also demonstrate fiber delivery (and return) of low power interrogation pulses and the delivery of the high energy pulses through the fiber.  Finally, U.S. Laser will identify key problems that need to be solved before this system can see field use, and possible technologies to help solve them.  This Phase I project will provide proof-of-principle for the ARMY concept, generate preliminary requirements, and provide technical information required for the design and fabrication of a compact hybrid laser system for Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Huge market opportunities in flat panel displays have motivated continuing efforts to develop a \"leap-frog\" technology. Organic light emitting devices are an emerging technology which promises a radically new approach to the manufacture of such displays. UNIAX is active in this high risk/high payoff technology through its program to develop polymer light emitting diodes. This type of device consists of a layer of electroluminescent polymer \"sandwiched\" between a pair of metal electrodes. Devices which emit different colors are produced by using chemically distinct polymers for the active layer. Because the electronic structure of the polymer is an important determinant of the electrical characteristics of the device, this latter fact implies that different color emitters have different electrical characteristics. In order to construct a full color display based on this technology, a different driver circuit is required for each of the three different color sub-pixels. UNIAX has discovered a method which can be used to make different color polymer light emitting devices with identical electrical characteristics. This enables the fabrication of full color flat panel displays with greatly simplified driver circuits. UNIAX proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of this concept by fabricating a demonstration prototype. Economical color flat panel displays are expected to find use in a number of military and civilian applications, including heads-up displays, appliances, automotive instrument panels, and consumer electronics. The total market for all such applications is estimated to reach anywhere from $14 billion to $20 billion by the end of the decade.",

Over the past four years, UNIAX has conducted a research and development program to develop such devices based on organic polymer active layers.  The simplest element of this type of device consists of a layer of electroluminescent polymer \"sandwiched\" between a pair of metal electrodes.  When a voltage is applied between the electrodes, charge carriers are injected into the polymer layer (electrons on one side and holes on the opposite side).  These oppositely charged carriers meet within the layer and recombine, resulting in the emission of light.  The present proposal outlines an effort to develop fibrillar, textured electron transport polymer layers from polyquinoline for enhanced electron injection.  The effort is based on the high surface area and local field enhancement advantages for hole injection previously demonstrated with textured polyaniline layers.  By enhancing both the electron and the hole injection, we anticipate better devices with improved power efficiency and lower operating voltage.",

        "abstract": "Fiber optic measurement of aflatoxins will be performed suing optrodes specific for aflatoxin.  One optrode will consist of aflatoxin linked by adsorption or immobilized by sulfhydryl groups on the tip of a fiber optic bundle.  For determination of aflatoxin using immobilized F(ab') antibody, the antibody will first be cleaved and then immobilized to quartz plates or wafers by silinization.  Aflatoxin-antibody conjugates, in which aflatoxin has a native fluorescence occurring at 362 nm, will be measured directly against a standard curve using a fluorimeter.  Another scheme, in which the aflatoxin antibody is immobilized and then labeled with FITC or chemiluminescent tag (isoluminol), will be quenched due to the presence of free aflatoxin.  Alternatively, an aflatoxin-oxime can be labeled with either FITC, through a isothiocyanate linkage, or with isoluminol glutaraldehyde condensation and immobilized on the fiber optic bundle.  Aflatoxin antibody will be co-incubated with known (spiked) or unknown samples before measurement.  As free aflatoxin concentrations increase, signals increase in a proportional manner.  These measurements will be conducted with a Lumac Biocounter and plotted against a known standard curve.  Optrode accuracy will be determined against standard in-house ELISA and HPLC methods performed at local USDA or FDA laboratories.",

        "abstract": "Small seismic events occur continuously at random time intervals within the earth.  These events have been referred to as ambient noice, microtremors, or microseisms.  Randomly occurring micro- seisms can be compressed into a single source-pulse and the earth's reflectivity function by taking the autocorrelation of a long sequence of data (Sosie method).  In effect, numerous microseisms are compressed into a single earthquake record which can then be used to analyze the response of a site to ground motions.  In the frequency domain, earthquake seismologists refer to the reflectivity function as the site amplification response.  Near- surface soil layers are known to cause frequency-dependent ampli- fication of ground motions during an earthquake.  Ground amplifi- cation as high as 25 times bedrock motions were reported at Treasure Island from the Loma Prieta aftershocks.  The objective of this proposed study is to show that microseism PSD estimates can be used to predict ground-amplification without the need for ex- pensive soil testing.  These direct measurements would provide a more accurate and cost effective means for predicting ground motion.",

Switching with vacuum interrupters is widely used in electric power distribution systems and is the most advanced technology available today. This project will address specific issues related to using the existing technology in applications where higher interrupting currents but lower voltages are required. The advantages of the proposed method are: 1. use and expansion of proven, existing and commercially attractive technology; 2. low cost of vacuum interrupters; 3. low weight; 4. stable operation of the vacuum arc; 5. long life; 6. minimal losses in closed position at high load currents; 7. virtually maintenance-free interrupters; 8. possibility of diverting undesirable stray magnetic fields inside the interrupter to enhance the current interruption capability.",

        "abstract": "Program objective is to design an extremely narrowband filter assembly that restricts focused irradiance on focal plane arrays to 5.43 microns with a bandwidth less than 0.005 microns. This novel multi-element optical configuration uses two narrowband filters in conjunction with wedge-shaped corrector faceplates to produce the required spectral profile over an irradiance collection angle at least +/- 12.5 degrees. Technical feasibility of this approach is based on the physical principles that (1) spectral bandpass wavelengths are decreased when a narrowband filter is tilted relative to the optical axis and (2) the cone angle of focuses irradiance traversing a window material is compressed in proportion to the material's refractive index (Snell's Law). In subsequent discussions, this spectral bandpass design will be referred to as the \"Dirac Composite Filter\" (DCF). Proof of concept will be accomplished by designing, fabricating, assembling and testing the Dirac filter and wedge components that exhibit the required spectral band profile. Results derived from this prototype DCF program will establish a verifiable methodology for manufacturing narrowband filter designs that (1) have more precisely defined spectral profiles over large 4 inch apertures; (2) are less expensive to fabricate; and (3) can be installed between optics and focal planes without any widening of spectral bandwidth.",

The proposed RRPS processes a wide RF bandwidth to determine frequency, amplitude, pulse width, and other modulation parameters of EW and radar system signals in real time. Once frequency and amplitude are determined, the RRPS tunes a narrow band receiver to the detected signal and records actual waveform samples. The narrow band receiver bandwidth is greater than the instantaneous bandwidth of the radar and EW signals. The RRPS will allow test analysts to effectively recreate the RF test environment to accurately evaluate the responses of the system under test. The RRPS will provide display tools that allow analysts to view signal frequencies over time and to make relative time measurements similar to a digital storage scope or logic analyzer.",

        "abstract": "It is the purpose of this proposal to develop the key technologies required to construct a man-portable advanced multimedia imaging helmet system. We will develop and demonstrate three helmet designs including a monocle headset, a goggle headset, and a face plate.  These three helmet platforms will be founded on the miniaturized CPU, communications, display, audio, and sensor technologies established and tested in this proposal. The multimedia helmet will be capable of using sensor data and user input to access remote expert systems. This system will be ideal for central or distributed precision team coordination. We feel that the use of this system will strongly improve the overall ability and safety of individuals or teams in the areas of military operations, police/FBI activities, fire fighting, and shipboard or dockside operations. The advanced multimedia imaging helmet systems would have tremendous commercial appeal in the areas of education, medical care, and emergency management institutions.

        "abstract": "Using time-synchronized optical sources and a constellation of receivers, Visidyne proposes to design and demonstrate a remote metrology system capable of measuring the six degrees of freedom of a Head-Mounted Display System and do it with minimal latency.   The approach closely parallels the Global Positioning System (GPS), but substitutes intensity-modulated optical beams for the L-band microwave amplitude carrier of the GPS. This overlap should make it possible to apply much of the technology base already developed for GPS RF, IF, and digital subsections as well as software routines, thus reducing future costs and improving prospects for commercial entry.   The basic measurement unit of the proposed system consists of a light source, such as a laser diode which is intensity-modulated in the gigahertz range, and a PIN diode detector. Changes in range between the source and the detector are determine by accurate measurements of the phase of the source modulation relative to the phase observed by the detector. Changes in range on the order of 30 micromweters should be detectable. By using multiple detectors and/or sources, translational and rotational measurements can be made. The technique is innovative in that it uses optical beams. Relative to microwave beams, optical beams can be more effieiently generated and can utilize inexpensive, standard components. The proposed program consists of laboratory tests of the basic concept, a study of the system design parameters, and preliminary design of an optical metrology system to be constructure and tested in Phase II. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: The commercial potential of the technology would appear to be vast. Applications include use in flight simulators, heads-up displays, instructional and training systems, virtual reality systems, machine tool/robotic control, and indoor navigation for hospitals, warehouses, etc. Using this technology, it will be possible to construct what are essentially mini-GPS metrology facilities in any laboratory, machine ship, factory, or construction site. However, this technique will utilize inexpensive components and provide considerably more precision than GPS.",

        "abstract": "We propose to develop a what-if analysis tool for hardware/software co-design.  It will provide a test-bed in which the user can quickly evaluate hardware/software co-design trade-offs.  No tool currently available in the ESDA market supports this essential step in hardware/software co-design.  Several new trends have made the current system design practice of separately developing hardware and software components increasingly untenable.  The demand for new technology products involving video ,audio, and communication applications and the increasing prevalence of \"algorithm on a chip\" strategies indicates that the hardware/software divide is in a state of flux, and good system design must ensure that hardware/software trade-offs are investigated as part of the design process.  However, this requires efficient tool support.  Our proposed tool will provide the enabling technology to carry out this essential step in hardware/software co-design.  The central feature of the tool is quick and automated development of a VHDL performance prototype of both the software and hardware components of the system.  The software elements of the system are represented as a VHDL testbench, the hardware elements as VHDL performance models, and the integrating software and hardware elements as a single VHDL entity.  During Phase I we will develop the architecture of the tool and test out the methodology with a hardware/software co-design example.  We will be assisted in this work by Motorola's Chicago Systems Research Laboratories.  The goal of Phase 2 is to implement, integrate, and productize the tool.",

        "abstract": "This Phase I study will show the feasibility of ultrahigh-pressure wagerer coke removal and laser-optic inspection for the renewal of jet engine fuel tubes and manifolds.  Ultrahigh-pressure, 55,000 psi, pure waterjets offer significant advantages as the basis for a new coke removal method for cleaning and clearing jet engine components.  Existing chemical dissolution and abrasive flow methods cannot clear blockages and are hazardous to the environment, health, and workpieces.  Pure waterjets can safely remove coke deposits and unblock tubes faster and at a lower cost than existing methods, with no damage to the parent material.  For the inspection of component internal surfaces, we will adapt a laser-optic measurement system with a custom miniature sensor. Characterization of these long, curved, small-diameter surfaces is difficult or impossible using conventional technology.  The use of laser-based inspection, with accuracy of better than 1 mil, is applicable to manufacturing as well as maintenance.  The Phase I objectives include demonstrating removal of coke deposits using UHP pure water, a breadboard demonstration of the laser-optic component inspection system, and the preliminary design of industrial-grade cleaning and inspection systems.  Prototype machinery will be built and demonstrated in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "This proposal addresses the development of a versatile, low-cost tool and techniques for its application to the repair of composite materials in jet engine components. This tool will consist of a waterjet, abrasive-waterjet, or an abrasive suspension jet. The repair process may include several functions, such as the removal of components to be repaired, performing a repair function, adding features such as holes or slots, or reconditioning surfaces. The versatility of the waterjet tool lies in its ability to perform all of the above repair functions on almost any material. Current methods of repair and their deficiencies will be surveyed, focusing on techniques used for composites in other aircraft structures and for metal cold- section blades and vanes. Waterjet machining techniques to replace or enhance these methods will be identified. Case studies will be selected with components supplied by General Electric Aircraft Engines. We will also perform a comparative analysis on cost of repair. The functional requirements of the waterjet tool will be determined for the applications to be identified in this project. These functional requirements will be used to identify future repair processes and machine development needs to be addressed in Phase II.",

We propose a PC-based microelectronics inspection system that takes advantage of not only stereo imaging, but also multisensor imaging.  Method will be developed for obtaining real-time stereo images from X-ray and infrared cameras, both of which are very important for microelectronics.  Real-time algorithms will be developed for automatic depth measurement using stereo pairs from a single sensor type.  Then the depth information from two or more sensors will be used in conjunction to develop defect recognition algorithms that make use of the added information.  We will explore how new signal processing and detection technologies (e.g., neural networks, fuzzy logic, and rule-based systems) can aid in automating microelectronic inspections.  Our primary goals for Phase I are to demonstrate stereoscopic 3D imaging of typical microelectronic components on a PC computer, using both X-ray and infrared images, and to produce a System Concept Document that will (a) review current literature and inspection procedures, (b) explore concepts and algorithms for multisensor data fusion, and (c) present a preliminary design for the prototype system to be built during Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Rapid Metal Fabrication (RAMFAB) is a technique in urgent need of development. Since the introduction of rapid prototyping (RP) systems such as StereoLithography and Fused Deposition Modeling for creating non-metallic prototype parts of arbitrary geometry, manufacturing industries have been waiting anxiously for a system to create free-form metal parts directly from three-dimensional computer-aided-design (CAD) models.  Metal parts are better able to withstand the rigors of performance testing and service than plastic, wax, or paper laminate parts.  However, to make free-form metal parts using current RP techniques requires additional processes, such as molding and casting, which drive up the cost and lead time.  It is proposed to make RAMPAB commercially available by combining the well-developed process of automated arc welding with some of the best elements of current rapid prototyping processes.  Using knowledge of three-dimensional CAD modeling and computer- controlled robotics together with a team of academic and industry experts, a commercial system to create metal parts directly from three-dimensional CAD data will be developed.  Since RAMFAB will be able to produce many high-strength, highly complex metal parts faster than conventional machining, casting, and forging operations, the process will be used for both prototyping and manufacturing.",

        "abstract": "The proposed study will evaluate the feasibility of using an optical sensor (structured lighting/image processing) to detect gap and tape/tow widths for automated composites fabrication processes such as tape laying, tow placement, and filament winding.  The sensor will serve as a real-time, quality-control monitor during fabrication, which will allow for production of consistently higher-quality structural aircraft parts.  Accurate placement and alignment of the tape/tows during fabrication are directly linked to the mechanical behavior of a composite component.  It has also been found that leaving small gaps during lay-up can be beneficial, but that overlaps are to be avoided.  Thus, on-line inspection of gap and tape/tow widths can significantly improve the material properties of composites manufactured using these processes. Materials investigated will include graphite/epoxies, glass/epoxies, and Kevlar/epoxies.  Although we are only demonstrating on epoxy materials, the sensor can be used on thermoplastic matrices as well.  Phase I efforts will demonstrate the feasibility of the concept by inspecting flat, tow-placed materials under high speeds.  A part will be fabricated under the Phase I effort with real-time collection and display of tape or tow placement quality data.  A method by which this information can be incorporated into automated compensation for part fabrication will be identified.  Phase II will extend the effort to non-flat surfaces, wide tapes, and to the development of a feedback control loop.",

Current mechanisms of video-tape/satellite/telephone-conferencing auctions favor the large volume producer who can generate 50,000 pound, trailer-load lots of cattle consisting of similar weight, grade, and sex (hereafter referred to as \"load-lots\").  The marketing strategy proposed herein provides a low-cost mechanism for small-volume cattle producers to aggregate their product into load-lots for sale, eliminating this barrier to trade for the small-volume farmer.\n\nProfessional cattle order-buyers have always relied on subjective methods for grading cattle, be it their own judgement or someone's they trust.  We intend to lay the groundwork for the development of an independent computer-based, image analysis system that will classify cattle by grade, description, and estimated weight solely by evaluation of digitized pictures of an animal.  This would allow the small producer to video-tape his own cattle, without the current necessity of having an independent grader visit his farm.  The producer could then submit the video-tape for computer grading and offer his cattle for sale over the Internet.",

        "abstract": "Historically, the full aperture of a high energy laser mirror has been liquid cooled with enough coolant to handle the peak absorbed thermal flux load over the entire mirror. Previous high energy laser mirrors considered only highly conductive materials and cooling schemes which minimized thermal distortion. Then, the advent of very low absorption coatings and silicon optics provided a laser mirror technology which could withstand high flux loads without liquid cooling. But, in laser weapons systems contamination is a very real concern and ultimately leads to increased absorption. The increased absorption causes increased thermal distortion and reduced beam quality which can greatly reduce beam flux at the target. Increased absorption also causes the mirror surface and valuable VLA coating to heat up, potentially to the point of catastrophic damage. Phase I will demonstrate the feasibility of adaptive pumping. The adaptive pumps contain shape memory elements which sense coolant temperature and once activated by absorbed heat flux, pump coolant into the heat exchanger at a rate proportional to the heat flux. Xray synchrotron systems being developed by Argonne, Brookhaven, National Laboratories require cooled silicon optics to sample the xray beam. These systems currently use cooled mirror with complex coolant systems. The adaptive mirrors will reduce the cost by a factor of 10 and could become standard in xray lithography systems.",

Available x-ray tubes cannot meet the high energy levels (>150kV) and power levels (>100mA) required to produce rapid, high resolution, tomographic images of large objects and high density materials.  XSI proposes to design a suitable scanned linear x-ray source using commercially available electron beam welder components.  The proposed source would also employ novel electron beam position control and monitoring systems to increase the resolution of the imaging system and prevent damage to the tube.",

We have directly relevant experience that makes us especially qualified to design ADCs for IR FPAs.  At Tanner Research, we have designed, fabricated, and successfully demonstrated two CMOS imagers with on-chip ADCs.  One design included a single 10-bit flash ADC with a 2D imager, and the other included a bank of somewhat slower 10-bit ADCs with a 1D imager. Both imager chips produce data at 20 million samples per second. Further, we have fabricated a number of micropower ADCs that may be suitable for inclusion on an ROIC.

        "abstract": "We propose to develop an advanced motion-compensated video compression that uses optical-flow motion estimation and segmentation to high compression rates while maintaining critical image features such as edges and textures. Optical-flow is the apparent two-dimensional flow of intensity changes in a sequence of images. Based upon our earlier work on optical-flow image analysis, an advanced optical-flow segmentation algorithm, using discontinuity information in both velocity and intensity domains, would permit the segmenting of video sequences along naturally occurring motion boundaries (edges). By encoding the boundary information and the velocities of uniformly moving patches in the image, a compression system would make better use of the frame- to-frame coherency in video sequences than do current block-based estimation algorithms. Such an encoding system would result in greatly reduced coding size for video, and would, additionally, preserve edge information in the decompressed video. The inherent parallel nature of the optical-flow algorithm allows for implementation on low-cost analog ASIO, providing an inexpensive, real-time compression engine. During Phase I we will develop a video compression CODEC that uses optical-flow image segmentation, and evaluate its ability to preserve critical image features. In Phase II we will develop a real-time implementation of the CODEC in VLSI hardware.",

We proposed to quantify the performance of asynchronous designs relative to equivalent synchronous ones. To do so, during Phase I, we will design two or more non-trivial digital circuit functions including a small microcontroller with equivalent function to a commercially available part. We will design both asynchronous and synchronous versions, for comparison to each other as well as to the commercial version. We will compare design complexity, power consumption, device area, speed, and cost.   During Phase I, we will fabricate both the sample microcontroller designs through MOSIS, so testing, and evaluation can begin immediately in Phase II. This testing will lead to optimization strategies to use in a much more aggressive Phase II design. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: Asynchronous circuits, the benefits of which may be confirmed by the results of this effort, are ideal for low power battery-driven notebook computers and personal digital assistants (PDAs). Also, we intend to directly market the microcontroller designs developed under this research effort as library elements.",

An impediment to millimeterwave technology advancement has been the lack of adequate computer-aided design (CAD) models for active devices.  The emerging high electron mobility and heterojunction bipolar transistors (HEMT and HBT) are the devices of choice for many millimeterwave applications.  We propose to formulate HEMT and HBT models suitable for use with commercial CAD software.    For Phase I, we will study the physics of HEMT and HBT device by reviewing the published literature and obtaining input from industry and government researchers.  We will then apply our expertise in robust, analytical, and table-based modeling to develop novel, computationally efficient CAD oriented models that reflect device physics.  Our high frequency experience will enable us to extend the range of existing modeling concepts into the millimeterwave domain.  The feasibility of these modeling concepts will be verified by demonstrating that all critical millimeterwave device behaviors are represented by the model.    In Phase II, these models will be fully formulated and refined to make them practicable, computationally efficient, and extractable from measured data.  They will then be integrated into a commercially available low-cost circuit simulation tool.",

Neural networks hold considerable promise to deliver very high performance and powerful new capabilities, as well as compact physical size, low power and high reliability.  Such electronic neural networks are very attractive to system developers. To date, actual systems incorporating electronic neural networks have been limited (and expensive),due to a lack of flexibility in constructing custom network architectures with the available hardware modules. We propose to develop circuit techniques and design synthesis tools for simplifying the communication interface between  application-specific   neural   network    integrated circuits.  This interface will exploit an address-event protocol, a recent invention of the Principal Investigator. This protocol permits analog or digital information to be efficiently transmitted from IC to IC, and solves a long- standing interface problem for richly-connected neural network architectures. In Phase I, we will prove the tools by FABRICATING demonstration circuits, building on existing Tanner Research commercial CAD tool technology. our approach will utilize commercial integrated circuit technology; products arising from this R&D can be fabricated reliably and economically by a number of vendors.",

Tanner Research proposes to develop a staring array with per-pixel laser radar processors, in addition to conventional light-intensity-based imaging.  This focal plane will generate a three-dimensional view of the target, and will eliminate the need for mechanical scanning of the laser beam, as well as the need for extra sensor-fusion processing and multi-sensor image registration.  This approach promises high frame rate laser rangefinding, because the range calculation occurs at each pixel simultaneously.  It also will lead to compact, mechanically simple and hence robust systems that can be deployed in a variety of tactical environments, including battlefield rifle sights and navigation aids for air-based weapon platforms and delivery systems.  The potential low cost of this system will open new applications to autonomous guided vehicle and \"smart weapon\" systems.  In the Phase I effort, Tanner Research will prove the validity of the approach, and establish a performance baseline for the design work.
