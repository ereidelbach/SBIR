THE HEART OF THIS INSTRUMENT IS A LARGE ARRAY OF NUCLEAR DETECTORS MOSTLY CONSISTING OF SCINTILLATOR CRYSTALS COUPLED TO PHOTOMULTIPLIER TUBES. THE COMPLEXITY, COST, AND DIFFICULTY OF BUILDING AN INSTRUMENT WITH HUNDREDS OF THESE BULKY AND FAGILE PHOTOSENSORS IS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM. THE AVAILABILITY OF A SUITABLE SEMICONDUCTOR SENSOR TO REPLACE THE PHOTOTUBES AND SCINTILLATOR CRYSTALS WOULD BE A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH IN THE DESIGN OF POSITRON TOMOGRAPHY CAMERAS. THIS WOULD GREATLY REDUCE THE COST AND INCREASE THE PRACTICALITY OF PET CAMERAS. IT HAS LONG BEEN RECOGNIZED THAT DETECTORS MADE FROM THE SEMICONDUCTOR CADMIUM TELLURIDE (CDTE) ARE THEORETICALLY THE BEST CANDIDATES FOR USE AS A SEMICONDUCTOR SENSOR FOR PET CAMERAS. PREVIOUSLY, THIS TYPE OF DETECTOR WAS LIMITED BY BOTH SMALL ACTIVE VOLUMES AND THE INABILITY TO PROVIDE THE FAST RESPONSE NEEDED FOR THIS APPLICATION. A NEW CDTE DIODE STRUCTURE HAS RECENTLY BEEN STUDIED. AS A RESULT, SEVERAL OF THE PREVIOUS LIMITATIONS OF CDTE APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN OVER- COME.

THUS, THE PLANNED PROGRAM IS DIRECTED AT INVESTIGATING THE POSSIBILITY OF USING THIS NEW CDTE DETECTOR DESIGN FOR PET APPLICATIONS.

IN PHASE I, THE FEASIBILTY OF A COMPUTERIZED EXPERT SYSTEM WILL BE DEMONSTRATED BY DEVELOPING AND EVALUATING THE AUTOMATED DESIGN CONSULTATION COMPONENT OF THE SYSTEM AND BY DEVELOPING THE REPORT GENERATION FACILITY FOR ONE COMPLEX STATISTICAL INTERPRETATION PROBLEM. IN PHASE II, THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMPLETE COMPUTERIZED EXPERT STATISTICAL SYSTEM WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED. IT APPEARS THAT THERE IS A GREAT COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITY FOR A MICROCOMPUTER-BASED EXPERT SYSTEM TO ASSIST SCIENTISTS IN SELECTING, PERFORMING, INTERPRETING, AND REPORTING STATISTICAL PROCEDURES. IN ADDITION TO BEING COMMERCIALLY FEASIBLE, THE SYSTEM COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT UPON THE AMOUNT AND QUALITY",

THE APPROACH WILL BE TO MAKE THE DEUTERATED PRODUCTS BY FIRST PREPARING THE ISOTOPE LABELED STARTING MATERIALS OR INTERMEDIATE MONOMERS, AND THEN REACTING THESE TO FORM THE DESIRED POLYMERS. ATTEMPTS WILL ALSO BE MADE TO EXCHANGE THE POLYMERS DIRECTLY TO INVESTIGATE POSSIBLE DIRECT, LOW COST METHODS OF PREPARATION.

THESE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS HAVE RESEARCH OCTANE NUMBERS IN EXCESS OF 100, WHICH MAKES THEM SUITABLE FOR BOOSTING THE OCTANE NUMBER OF UNLEADED GASOLINE.

CK EXISTS PRIMARILY AS THREE ISOENZYMES: BB, WHICH IS PRESENT IN BRAIN; MB, WHICH PRIMARILY EXISTS IN HEART MUSCLE; AND MM, WHICH IS PRESENT BOTH IN HEART AND SKELETAL MUSCLES. CURRENT METHODS FOR MEASURING MB INCLUDE ELECTROPHORESIS, COLUMN CHROMATOGRAPHY, ENZYME INHIBITION, AND RADIOIMMUNOSSAY (RIA). ALTHOUGH THE ABOVE METHODS ARE USEFUL IN MEASURING MB IN SERUM, THERE ARE INHERENT LIMITATIONS IN THESE METHODS. ELECTROPHORESIS AND CHROMATOGRAPHY ARE NOT SENSITIVE, AND THUS PRECISE QUANTITATION OF MB AT THE LOWER LEVEL BECOMES DIFFICULT. ENZYME INHIBITION AND RIA METHODS, ALTHOUGH QUITE SENSITIVE, MAY NOT BE SPECIFIC ALL THE TIME BECAUSE THEY MEASURE B SUBUNIT OF BOTH MB AND BB AND ALSO CROSS-REACT WITH THE MACROMOLECULAR FORMS OF CK. THREE COMMERCIAL KITS ARE AVAILABLE WHICH MEASURE SPECIFIC MB ISOENZYME: TWO USE SOLID-PHASE SANDWICH IMMUNOASSAY TECHNIQUE AND THE OTHER USES A COMBINATION OF ENZYME INHIBITION AND PRECIPITATION METHODS.

SPECIFIC AIMS ARE TO USE COMPUTER SIMULATIONS TO DESIGN AN OPTIMAL ENERGY SELECTIVE DETECTOR BASED ON PHOTOSTIMUABLE PHOSPHOR TECHNOLOGY, CONSTRUCT A PROTOTYPE, AND VERIFY PERFORMANCE BY USE OF PHANTOMS. COMPUTER SIMULATIONS WILL MEASURE THE RESPONSE OF MATERIALS TO X-RAY ENERGIES PRODUCED BY CONVENTIONAL RADIOGRAPHIC EQUIPMENT. CANDIDATES FOR DETECTOR MATERIALS WILL BE THOSE THAT HAVE LARGE DIFFERENCES IN THEIR RESPONSE TO X-RAYS OF LOW AND HIGH ENERGIES, BUT WILL STILL PRODUCE A QUALITY IMAGE. PHOTOSTIMULATED RESPONSES WILL BE MEASURED FOR ALL CANDIDATE MATERIALS AND ENERGY SELECTIVE DETECTORS WILL BE FABRICATED FOR SELECTED MATERIALS. IMAGES OF SPECIFIC PHANTOMS WILL BE TAKEN, AND A SPECIAL PURPOSE LASER SCANNER WILL MEASURE THE ENERGY SELECTIVE DATA. PHASE II RESEARCH WILL BE DESIGNED TO STUDY SPECIFIC CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF THE ENERGY SELECTIVE SYSTEM BY COMPARISON TO ESTABLISHED MODALITIES AND SURGICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS.",

THE SYSTEM WILL OPERATE ON A THERMODYNAMIC CYCLE THAT IS A MODIFICATION OF THE CONVENTIONAL RANKINE CYCLE, IN WHICH THE NORMAL BOILER FEED PUMP IS REPLACED BY A \"PASSIVE PUMPING MODULE\" (PPM) AND THE WORKING FLUID IS A SUITABLE ORGANIC FLUID. THIS NEW ORGANIC VAPOR CYCLE IS ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE IT CAN BE USED EFFECTIVELY WITH MEDIUM TEMPERATURE HEAT SOURCES INCLUDING RADIO- ISOTOPES, REACTORS, OR SOLAR COLLECTORS. THE PARASITIC POWER REQUIRED FOR THE BOILER FEED PUMP IN MEDIUM TEMPERATURE CONVENTIONAL ORGANIC RANKINE CYCLE POWER SYSTEMS TESTED TO DATE CAN BE 20% TO 30% OF THE SYSTEM OUTPUT POWER. BY REPLACING THE BOILER FEED PUMP BY THE PPM, THE PARASITIC PUMPING POWER SHOULD BE ONLY 2% TO 3% OF THE OUTPUT POWER. THUS, THE USE OF THE PPM PROMISES HIGHER SYSTEM EFFICIENCY, LIGHTER WEIGHT, AND HIGHER RELIABILITY FOR SMALL TO MEDIUM SIZE ORGANIC RANKINE CYCLE POWER GENERATORS. A MAJOR PART OF THE RESEARCH WILL BE TO DEVELOP A ZERO-GRAVITY PPM. A PPM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED THAT CIRCULATES FREON IN A TERRESTRIAL SOLAR HEATING SYSTEM. ALSO SOLAR RESEARCHERS AT THE LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY HAVE DEVELOPED A SIMILAR PPM. THE ZERO-GRAVITY PPM WILL USE FEATURES OF THE TERRESTRIAL PPMS ALREADY IN USE IN ADVANCED FREON PHASE-CHANGE SOLAR HEATING SYSTEMS.",

SILICA AEROGELS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO FILL THIS GAP, AND TETECTORS HAVE BEEN MADE USING THEM WITH VARYING DEGREES OF SUCCESS. PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH THE PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE AEROGELS HAS BEEN THEIR POOR OPACITY, ESPECIALLY AT THE BLUE END OF THE VISIBLE SPECTRUM, BECAUSE OF SCATTERING AND SOME ABSORPTION.

TRANSIT TIME MEASUREMENTS BETWEEN OR N ORTHOGONAL PAIRS OF TRANSDUCER MOUNTED RIGIDLY IN A HOLDER PROVIDE THE BASIC INFORMATION NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE LONGITUDINAL STRESS. THE SECOND APPROACH USES TWO BULK SH WAVES OF THOGONAL POLARIZATION. HERE, THE TRANSIT TIME OF THESE TWO WAVES OVER EXACTLY THE SAME ULTRASONIC PATH PROVIDES THE BASIC INFORMATION NEEDED FOR LONGITUDINAL STRESS DETERMINATION.

REASONS FOR RESEARCH: INFORMATION NEEDS OF SYSTEM USERS FREQUENTLY CHANGE. EFFICIENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS MUST BE ABLE TO ACCOMODATE EVOLVING INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS; HOWEVER, AVAILABLE INFORMATION SYSTEMS PROVIDE LIMITED FEATURES FOR DYNAMIC MODIFICATION. METHODS PROPOSED: AN INTELLIGENT DATA BASE MODEL COMPRISED OF THREE MODULES IS PROPOSED. THESE MODULES ARE (1) A DATA MODEL DEFINER, (2) AN INTERPRETATION DEFINER, AND (3) A DATABASE/INTERPRETATION ORGANIZER. THE PROPOSED MODEL IS BASED ON THE ENTITY-RELATIONSHIP MODEL AND ON RESEARCH ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. SPECIFICATIONS FOR EACH MODULE WILL BE DEVELOPED USING THE MOST RECENT RESEARCH ON KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION. ANTICIPATED RESULTS: THE RESULT OF THIS WORK WILL BE SPECIFICATIONS FOR AN INTELLIGENT DATA BASE MODEL WHEREIN DATA ARE STORED AS ENTITIES THAT CAN BE SEMANTICALLY INTERPRETED OR RELATED, USING ADDITIONAL FACTS AND HEURISTICS IN THE KNOWLEDGE BASE TO DERIVE THE DESIRED INFORMATION. IMPLICATIONS OR RESEARCH: THE INTELLIGENT DATA BASE MODEL ISTHE FIRST STEP IN DEVELOPING AN IDBMS. IT WILL PROVIDE THE FRAMEWORK FOR INTELLIGENT INFORMATION RETRIEVAL VIA THE IDBMS. POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS: THE IDBMS IS A WAY TO PERFORM A KNOWLEDGE-BASED SEARCH OF DATA. IT CAN BE USED TO PROCESS ALMOST ALL FORMS OF DIVERSE DATA WHERE CAUSE-EFFECT RELATIONSHIPS ARE SOUGHT.",

INDIVIDUAL SEMICONDUCTOR LASER DIODES CANNOT MEET THE OTHER REQUIREMENTS OF DEEP SPACE COMMUNICATIONS SUCH AS HIGH BRIGHTNESS AND LOW BEAM DIVERGENCE. HOWEVER, SIMICONDUCTOR LASER DIODE ARRAYS EMPLOYING COHERENT BEAM COMBINING CAN MEET ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS. OUR SOLUTION TO DEVELOPING SUCH A LASER SOURCE IS TO UTILIZE AN EXTERNAL CAVITY TO OBTAIN A COHERENT OUTPUT FROM AN ARRAY OF SEMICONDUCTOR LASER DIODES. THIS CONCEPT IS WELL KNOWN. HOWEVER, WE WILL INCORPORATE NEW TECHNIQUES TO MINIMIZE THE SIZE AND WEIGHT WHILE OPTIMIZING THE OUTPUT OF THE LASER. WITH THIS NEW DESIGN, IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN UP TO 100 WATTS OF CW OUTPUT FROM A TWO-DIMENSION SEMICONDUCTOR LASER DIODE ARRAY MEASURING ONE CENTIMETER SQUARE WHICH MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF A DEEP SPACE MISSION.",

THESE MATERIALS ARE SUFFICIENTLY GOOD SO THAT PROPOSALS TO IMPROVE THEIR PERFORMANCE MUST BE VIEWED WITH ALERTNESS IF NOT SCEPTICISM. THE LACK OF PERMANENT CHEMICAL CROSSLINKS IN THESE POLYMERS LIMITS THE USEFUL RANGE OF EQUIVALENT WEIGHT BECAUSE THE WATER UPTAKE CAN BE TOO HIGH AS THE WEIGHT IS DECREASED, OR THE ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE CAN BE TOO HIGH AS THE EQUIVALENT WEIGHT IS INCREASED. THE PRACTICAL RANGE HAS BEEN 800 TO 1500, WITH CARBOXYLATE ON THE CATHODE SIDE OF CHLORALKALI CELLS. THE NEW MEMBRANE WILL HAVE INDEPENDENT CONTROL OF SWELLING THROUGH THE WIDE RANGE OF CROSSLINK DENSITY AVAILABLE, AND WILL PERMIT THE EQUIVALENT WEIGHT TO BE ONE-THIRD TO ONE-QUARTER OF THE FIGURES CITED ABOVE. SOLVENTS AND DILUENTS MAY BE USED TO INFLUENCE THE POROSITY AND HENCE THE FLUX RATE. TO PREPARE THE MEMBRANES, SELECTED MONOMERS ARE COPOLYMERIZED TO FORM A PRECURSOR FILM OF DESIRED THICKNESS, CROSSLINK DENSITY, AND FUNCTION- ALITY, AND THEN THE HYDROGEN ATOMS ARE REPLACED VERY CAREFULLY WITH FLUORINE ATOMS USING F2 GAS TO RETAIN THE CARBON SKELETON AS DESIGNED.

MEMBRANE PROCESSES HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR GREATLY REDUCING ENERGY REQUIREMENTS FOR INDUSTRIAL SEPARATIONS. THE PRINCIPAL BARRIER TO WIDER USE OF GAS SEPARATION MEMBRANES IS THE DIFFICULTY IN MAKING SUFFICIENTLY SELECTIVE MEMBRANES WITH AN ECONOMICALLY HIGH ENOUGH GAS FLUX. BECAUSE STAGING MEMBRANE MODULES (WHICH WOULD ENABLE OPERATION WITH LOW-SELECTIVITY, HIGH-FLUX MEMBRANES) HAVE NOT PROVED ECONOMICAL, MEMBRANES ARE MADE OF HIGH-SELECTIVITY, LOW-PERMEABILITY POLYMERS FORMED INTO VERY THIN LAYERS OF INCREASED GAS TRANSPORT RATES. WITH CURRENT, ANISOTROPIC MEMBRANE TECHNOLOGY, MEMBRANES WITH BARRIER LAYERS ABOUT 0.1MM CAN BE MADE. FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN PERFORMANCE OF GAS SEPARATION MEMBRANES DEPEND ON DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGIES TO MAKE EVEN THINNER, MORE SELECTIVE MEMBRANES. IMPROVED MEMBRANES FOR HYDROGEN SEPARATION ARE VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF THE INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ROLE FORESEEN FOR HYDROGEN IN SYNFUELS PROCESSING, IN CHEMICAL PRODUCTION FROM SYNTHESIS GAS, IN AMMONIA PRODUCTION, AND IN BOTTOM- OF-THE-BARREL UPGRADING.

A REVIEW OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY'S (EPA) \"SAFE SLUDGE\" DESIGNATION FOR USE IN FOOD PRODUCTION SHOWS THAT NEARLY HALF OF ALL SLUDGES GENERATED CANNOT BE DEFINED AS \"SAFE,\" THUS ELIMINATING THE COST-EFFECTIVE ULTIMATE DISPOSAL ALTERNATIVE OF LAND APPLICATION. A PROCESS THAT COULD ELIMINATE THE TOXIC CONSTITUENTS OF SLUDGE WOULD BE OF B BENEFIT TO MANY MUNICIPALTIES AND INDUSTRIES. PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS DEVELOPED A PROCESS THAT PROMISES TO BE CAPABLE OF DETOXIFYING SEWAGE SLUDGE IN A COST-EFFECTIVE MANNER. THIS PROJECT OUTLINES THE NEXT PHASE THAT IS NEEDED TO BRIDGE RESEARCH INFORMATION WITH COMMERCIAL APPLICATION. AEROBIC DIGESTION WITH UNIQUE HIGHLY EFFICIENTSELF-ASPIRATING AERATORS WAS SHOWN TO BE CAPABLE OF AUTOHEATING SLUDGES TO PASTEURIZATION TEMPERATURES (50 CT) BY JEWELL IN A FULL SCALE FACILITY IN 1979. FUTHER DEVELOPMENT SHOWED THAT MODIFICATIONS TO THE PROCESS HAVE THE POTENTIAL OF REMOVING PATHOGENS, TOXIC METALS, AND POSSIBLY TOXIC ORGANICS IN A COST-EFFECTIVE SIMPLE PROCESS. AUTOHEATING SLURRY TEMPERATURES CAN EASILY ACHIEVE 60 C WITH MOST SLUDGES WITHOUT HEAT ENERGY ADDITONS (HIGHER TEMPERATURES WOULD BE POSSIBLE WITH HEAT EXCHANGERS), THUS KILLING ALL PATH OGENS. MANIPULATION OF THE PH IN THESE HOT AEROBIC SLURRIES SHOWED THAT GREATER THAN 80% OFMOST TOXIC METAL COULD RAPIDLY SOLUBILIZED (IN LESS THAN 3 HOURS). ALTHOUGH NOT TESTED, AERATION AT THESE TEMPERATURES WILL LIKELY RESULT INVOLATIONLIZATION OF SOME TOXIC ORGANICS. FINALLY, IT WAS SHOWN THAT THE PROCESS COULD ALSO BE APPLIED TO ANAEROBICAL LY DIGESTED SLUDGE. THIS LATER APPLICATION IS IMPORTANT NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE LARGE INSTALLED DIGESTION CAPACITY, BUT SHORT TERM AERATION (6 HOURS) OF ANAEROBICALLY DIGESTED SL SLUDGE RESULTS IN RAPID TEMPERATURE INCREASES, AND SIGN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED SETTLEABILITY AND DEWATERING CHARACTERISTICS THUS ACHIEVING UP TO 50% VOLUME REDUCTION. THUS A HYPOTHETICAL SYSTEM WITH HYDRAULIC RETENTION TIME OF LESS THAN 24 HOURS SHOULD BE CAPABLE OF NOT ONLY SUBSTANT IALLY REDUCING SLUDGE VOLUMES, BUT PRODUCE A SLUDGE THAT WO WOULD MEET EPA'S \"SAFE\" DESIGNATION FOR VIRTUALLY ALL ORGANIC SLUDGES EITHER AS AN ADD-ON PROCESS OR AS A NEW INSTALLATION. THIS STUDY WILL EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF THE UN UNIQUE SELF-ASPIRATING AERATORS ON THE SETTLEABILITY, DEWATERABILITY, AUTOHEATING, AND METAL REMOVAL CHARACTER ISTICS OF ANAEROBICALLY DIGESTED SEWAGE SLUDGE IN A 28M3 FULL SCALE UNIT LOCATED AT THE BINGHAMTON, NY, SEWAGE TRE TREATMENT FACILITY (A 190 MILLION 1/D CAPACITY PLANT).

DIAGNOSIS IS CURRENTLY MADE BY ELISA OR BY ELECTRON MICROSCOPY. THE LATTER IS IMPRACTICAL FOR THE SMALL LABORATORY, AND THE ELISA PRODUCES AN UNACCEPTABLE NUMBER OF FALSE POSITIVES. THE VIRUS CONSISTS OF 11 SEGMENTS OF DOUBLE-STRANDED RNA. THE NUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCE OF THE MAJOR OUTER CAPSID GLYCOPROTEIN GENE IS KNOWN FOR THREE HUMAN SEROTYPES. WE PROPOSE TO SYNTHESIZE DNA PROBES WHICH WILL HYBRIDIZE SPECIFICALLY WITH A REGION OF THE GENOME COMMON TO THE HUMAN SEROTYPES. PHASE I. BASED ON PUBLISHED SEQUENCE INFORMATION, WE WILL SYNTHESIZE AN OLIGONUCLEOTIDE PROBE COMPLEMENTARY BOTH TO THE PLUS STRAND RNA OF THE GENOME AND THE MRNA OF THE VIRUS. THE PROBE WILL BE TESTED FOR ITS ABILITY TO DETECT ROTAVIRUS IN CHARACTERIZED STOOL SAMPLES. THE MAJOR TECHNICAL INNOVATION IN THIS WORK WILL BE THE DEVELOPMENT OF METHODS WHICH ALLOW OLIGONUCLEOTIDE PROBES TO BE USED TO DETECT DOUBLE-STRANDED RNA VIRUSES IN CLINICAL SAMPLES. PHASE II. WE WILL CONDUCT CLINICAL TRIALS OF THE BEST PROBES SYNTHESIZED, PRIMARILY NONISOTOPICALLY LABELED, IN ORDER TO PRODUCE A CLINICAL DIAGNOSTIC KIT TO RAPIDLY DETECT ROTAVIRUS IN STOOL SAMPLES.",

THE \"\"KILLER'' FUNCTION OF K/NK CELLS IS ANTIBODY-DEPENDENT CELLULAR CYTOTOXICITY (ADCC), WHEREAS THE \"\"NATURAL KILLER'' FUNCTION IS AN ANTIBODY-INDEPENDENT CYTOLYTIC PROCESS. ALL K/NK CELLS BEAR FC RECEPTORS (FCRS) ON THEIR SURFACES WHICH SPECIFICALLY BIND TO THE FC PORTIONS OF ANTIBODIES ON ANTIBODY-COATED TARGET CELLS. FCR/FC INTERACTIONS CAUSE K/NK CELLS TO FORM SPECIFIC CONJUGATES WITH THEIR TARGET CELLS THUS INITIATING THE ENSUING LYSIS OF THE TARGETS. THE FCRS' INTERACTION WITH ANTIBODY AND THE ROLE THAT SUCH INTERACTIONS PLAY IN TRIGGERING THE LYTIC PROCESSES ARE NOT PRESENTLY UNDERSTOOD. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE EXPERIMENTS PROPOSED HERE IS TO DEVELOP A SIMPLE AND EFFICIENT METHOD FOR PREPARATIVELY PURIFYING THE FCRS OF K/NK CELLS ISOLATED FROM HUMAN PERIPHERAL BLOOD LEUKOCYTES (PBL) USING AN ANTI-FCR MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY AND CONVENTIONAL BIOCHEMICAL AND IMMUNOCHEMICAL STRATEGIES FOR MEMBRANE PROTEIN PURIFICATION. THE INITIAL STUDIES WILL FOCUS ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE FCR BY DETERMINING THE NUMBER OF POLYPEPTIDE SUBUNITS COMPRISING THE FCR AND POTENTIAL PRECURSOR/PRODUCT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DIFFERENT SUBUNITS. PURIFIED FCR MOLECULES WILL BE FRAGMENTED BY CNBR AND THE RESULTING PEPTIDE FRAGMENTS WILL BE CHARACTERIZED BY GEL FILTRATION AND BY SDS POLYACRYLAMIDE GEL ELECTROPHORESIS. THE PHASE II OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT WOULD BE TO DETERMINE ENOUGH OF THE AMINO ACID SEQUENCE OF FCR MOLECULES TO MAKE POSSIBLE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SUITABLE OLIGONUCLEOTIDE PROBE TO BE USED FOR ISOLATING THE FCR GENE(S) FROM THE HUMAN GENOME. THE ISOLATED GENE(S) WOULD ALLOW ONE TO CONDUCT MOLECULAR STUDIES OF FCR/FC INTERACTIONS AND THE LYTIC PROCESS. THE SEQUENCE OF THE GENE(S) COULD ALSO BE USED TO DEVELOP MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY PROBES AGAINST SELECTED PORTIONS OF THE FCR STRUCTURE CLINICALLY TO EVALUATE K/NK CELL FUNCTIONS AND MODIFY K/NK FUNCTIONS' RESPONSE TO DISEASE.",

THE METHODOLOGY WILL CONSIST OF PROCESSING THE STANDARD TAPE OFF-LINE USING A VAX 11/750 AND GENERATING TEST TAPES WITH VARIOUS SCHEMES USING PULSATILE CODES. THE TEST TAPES WILL BE PLAYED FOR SUBJECTS USING A BATTERY OPERATED RECORDER ELECTRICALLY COUPLED TO THE STIMULATING UNIT AND COUPLED THROUGH A STANDARD COIL TO THE ELECTRODE. THE MAJOR ASSUMPTION BEHIND THE CODING TECHNIQUES IS THAT THE ELECTRODE MUST BE DRIVEN PITCH SYNCHRONOUSLY FOR OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE. THE HYPOTHESIS TO BE TESTED IS THAT VOICE PITCH WILL BE CONVEYED THROUGH THE ELECTRODE BY THE REPETITION RATE OF CLUSTERS OF PULSES AND TIMBRE CAN BE VARIED BY MODIFYING THE CHARACTERISTICS AND NUMBER OF PULSES WITHIN THE CLUSTERS.",

USING THIS TECHNOLOGY THE RSA IS INVARIABLY PRESENT AND ACCURATELY QUANTIFIABLE IN ALL INDIVIDUALS REGARDLESS OF AGE. ITS AMPLITUDE FALLS PREDICTABLY APPROXIMATELY 10% PER DECADE. INDIVIDUALS WITH A TRANSPLANTED HEART OR SEVERE DIABETIC NEUROPATHY HAVE RESTING RSA THAT IS NORMAL FOR AGE. THE SHAPE AND AMPLITUDE OF THE RSA DURING VOLUNTARY CARDIORESPIRATORY SYNCHRONIZATION (VCRS) MAY REFLECT THE COMPLIANCE OF THE HEART MUSCLE AND ITS RESPONSE TO RHYTHMICALLY CHANGING INTRATHORACIC VOLUME, PRESSURE, AND THE SUBSEQUENT EBB AND FLOW OF VENOUS RETURN. THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS OBJECTIVE QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE BIOLOGIC AGE OF THE HEART AND ALSO THE EFFECT OF ANY DRUG, DISEASE, OR BEHAVIOR THAT AFFECTS THE RSA. BOTH ACUTE AND CHRONIC-CUMULATIVE CARDIOTOXIC EFFECTS OF ANTHRACYCLINES ARE READILY MEASURED USING THIS DEVICE. RSA DISAPPEARS ACUTELY FOLLOWING INTRAVENOUS DOXORUBICIN ADMINISTRATION, AND GRADUALLY RETURNS TOWARD PRETREATMENT VALUES DURING THE 30 DAYS FOLLOWING DRUG ADMINISTRATION. AN IRREVERSIBLE PROGRESSIVE FALL-OFF OF RSA (AVERAGING 7% PER 60 MG/M2 DOSE) ALSO ACCOMPANIES INCREASING CUMULATIVE DOXORUBICIN DOSAGE. RSA IS INVARIABLY UNDETECTABLE IN PATIENTS WITH PROVEN DOXORUBICIN-INDUCED CARDIOMYOPATHY. DETERMINATION OF RSA BY THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY PERMITS INSTANTANEOUS, NONINVASIVE, QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION OF CARDIOTOXICITY INDUCED BY DOXORUBICIN. PHASE I WILL RESULT IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION OF A MANUFACTURABLE SINE-O-GRAPH RSA MONITOR WHICH MAY BE USED TO MEASURE THE RSA AND TO QUANTIFY DOXORUBICIN-INDUCED HEART DAMAGE. *U.S. PATENT GRANTED MAY 28, 1985.

TO MEASURE THIS COMPLEX IMPEDANCE AT HIGH POWER LEVEL AND TO TRACK THE CHANGE OF THIS IMPEDANCE IN REAL TIME WHEN THE LOAD IS VARYING IN TIME ARE GENERALLY VERY DIFFICULT TASKS. CURRENTLY, THERE IS NO EQUIPMENT COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE FOR LEVELS WITHOUT GOING THROUGH SOME MAJOR HARDWARE MODIFIC- CATIONS. THIS PROPOSAL IS SPECIALLY AIMED AT THIS POINT TO DEVELOP A REAL-TIME COMPLEX IMPEDANCE MEASURING/TRACKING SYSTEM THAT CAN BE USED IN HIGH POWER LEVELS E.G.1 KW TO 10KW,CW, OR PULSED. THE PROPOSED WORK IS DERIVED FOR THE RESULT OF AN NSF-SUPPORTED PROJECT, \"A NOVEL MICROWAVE AUTOMATIC IMPEDANCE MEASUREMENT SYSTEM, ECS-8118880. \"THIS PROJECT WAS ALREADY SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED. THREE JOURNAL PAPERS (IEEE-MTT) AND SEVEN CONFERENCE PAPERS WERE PUBLISHED. THE THEORY OF THIS NOVEL SYSTEM IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE SIX-PORT ANA SYSTEMS, BUT BOTH WERE DEVELOPED QUITE INDEPENDENTLY IN THE PAST. BECAUSE OF THE SIMPLICITY OF THE THEORY, IT IS POSSIBLE FOR US TO REALIZE THE DESIGN BY USINGONLY ANALOG DEVICES. THE EXPERIMENT IS COMPLETED AND THE PERFORMANCES WERE CHECKED AT LOW POWER LEVELS (10MW). THE PHASE I OF THE PROPOSAL IS AIMED AT THE FEASIBILITY OF USINGTHIS SYSTEM AT HIGH POWER LEVELS, FOR EXAMPLE, IKW TO 10 KW.THE POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION AS DESCRIBED BY THE AWARDEE: RESEARCH WILL BE APPLIED TO MEASURING AND TRACKING REAL TIME THE CHANGES OF THE COMPLEX IMPEDANCE OF ANY MICRO WAVE LOAD EXCITED AT HIGH POWER LEVELS. EXAMPLES OF POTENTIAL MARKET ARE RADAR MANUFACTURERS, SATELLITE COMMUNI-CATIONS, MICROWAVE DRYING SYSTEMS, MICROWAVE OVENS, OR ANY MICROWAVE AUTOMATED TESTING LABORATORIES.",

THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THIS STUDY ARE: 1. THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONTACT SAPPHIRE CERAMIC PROBES, 2. FIBER OPTIC CONNECTING CABLES FOR DELIVERY OF LASER ENERGY TO PROBE, AND 3. TO STUDY THE TISSUE EFFECTS OF CONTACT LASER SURGERY IN RABBIT EYES, BOTH CLINICALLY AND HISTOLOGICALLY. DELIVERY OF ND:YAG AND ARGON LASER ENERGY WITH SAPPHIRE CERAMIC PROBE BY DIRECT CONTACT WITH TUMOR TISSUE RESULTS IN MORE ACCURATE PLACEMENT OF ENERGY (DEPTH AND LATERAL PENETRATION) PRODUCING LESS SURROUNDING TISSUE DAMAGE AND 75% LESS ENERGY NECESSARY THAN NONCONTACT DELIVERY. THE CONTACT SAPPHIRE CERAMIC PROBES WILL BE DEVELOPED AND FABRICATED BY SLT, JAPAN. THE LAUNCH OPTICS AND CONNECTING CABLES WILL BE DEVELOPED AND FABRICATED BY SLT, USA. THE SURGICAL APPLICATION AND TISSUE EFFECTS IN RABBITS WILL BE STUDIED BY CONSULTANTS AT THE WILLS EYE HOSPITAL. THE RESULTS OF THIS WILL ENABLE US TO GO TO PHASE II FOR EXPERIMENTAL REMOVAL OF UVEAL TUMORS IN RABBITS AND EVENTUALLY, WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE STUDY, FOR TREATMENT IN HUMANS.

THE INTERSTITIAL BORON-INTERSTITIAL OXYGEN MINORITY CARRIER TRAP CAN NOT BE ELIMINATED UNLESS ALL THE INTERSTITIAL OXYGEN ATOMS ARE REMOVED OR TRAPPED. HEAT TREATMENT AT 650 DEGREES TO 800 DEGREES CELSIUS FOR 20 HOURS OR 1000 DEGREES CELSIUS FOR 20 HOURS WILL PRODUCE OXYGEN AGGLOMERATES THAT WILL TRAP INTERSTITIAL OXYGEN ATOMS. THIS REDUCES THE NUMBER OF INTERSTITIAL OXYGEN ATOMS WHICH WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO COMPLEX WITH BORON. THE ADVANTAGE OF THIS TECHNIQUE IS THAT NO IMPURITIES HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE SILICON THAT COULD REDUCE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE SOLAR CELL. MOST OTHER HEAT-TREATMENT PROCEDURES COULD BE USED SUB- SEQUENTLY IN PROCESSING THE SOLAR CELL AND NOT DESTROY THE INERT OXYGEN COMPLEX. THE NEWLY CREATED OXYGEN COMPLEX IS VERY STABLE; ONLY HEAT TREATMENT AT 1350 DEGREES CELSIUS WOULD CAUSE DISASSOCIATION.",

ELECTRIC FIELDS WILL BE OBSERVED WITH SIMPLE CORONA CURRENT INSTRUMENTATION SINCE AIRCRAFT CAN TRIGGER LIGHTNING. LIGHTNING WILL BE MAPPED WITH AN INTERFEROMETER. THUS, THE PREAND POST-LIGHTNING AS WELL AS THE LIGHTNING PHASES OF A STORM WILL BE COVERED. THERE WILL BE COCKPIT DISPLAYS FOR THE ELECTRIC FIELD VECTOR, LIGHTNING POSITION AND SFERIC RATE. PRELIMINARY TESTING OF A CORONA SYSTEM HAS ALREADY BEEN ACCOMPLISHED ON OUR UNIQUE ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRIC RESEARCH AIRCRAFT. THE LIGHTNING INTERFEROMETER HAS BEEN PROVEN FOR DIRECTIONAL SENSING ON THE GROUND; THIS PROGRAM WILL EXTEND THE TECHNOLOGY TO AIRCRAFT INCLUDING SINGLE-STATION-RANGING.",

IN THIS CONCEPT A PULSED CO2 LASER OPERATING FROM A REMOTE PLATFORM IN AIR IS FOCUSED ON ICE TO GENERATE AN ACOUSTIC FIELD HAVING RELATIVELY FLAT FREQUENCY SPECTRUM OUT TO 100KHZ. A MICROPHONE ALSO LOCATED IN AIR DETECTS THE SOUND RELECTED FROM THE ICE/WATER INTERFACE. PRECISE TIMING OF THESE SIGNALS MAKES IT POSSIBLETO ACCURATELY MEASURE THE ICE THICKNESS. INITIAL ICE FIELD MEASUREMENTS PROVED THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS CONCEPT FOR MEASURING 1 METER THICK ICE. THE EMPHASIS OF THE PROPOSED PROGRAM IS TO INVESTIGATE THE BASIC AND SYSTEM PARAMETERS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO DEVELOP THIS CONCEPT INTO AN AIRBORNE REMOTE SYSTEM FOR MEASURING ICE THICKNESS OF SEVERAL METERS TO A RESOLUTION OF 0.25-0.5 METERS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SUCH A SYSTEM COULD BE USED IN A STAND-ALONE MODE, OR IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER \"ICE SENSORS\" TO ACCOMPLISH THE DESIRED DEPTH RESOLUTION AND WIDE AREA COVERAGE FOR ROUTINE SURVEILLANCE OF ICE THICKNESS.",
