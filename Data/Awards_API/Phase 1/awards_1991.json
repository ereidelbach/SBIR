ABARIS PROPOSES A COMBINED ANALYSIS AND TESTING PROJECT TO EXPLORE MODIFYING PRESENT RESIN TRANSFER MOLDING (RTM) TECHNIQUES TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF THEIR USE IN THE PRODUCTION OF HIGH PERFORMANCE, AEROSPACE, COMPOSITE MATERIALS. EPOXY RESINS SHALL BE UTILIZED IN COMBINATION WITH GRAPHITE REINFORCEMENTS IN THE FORM OF THICK (1/4 TO 1/2 INCHES) HIGH DENSITY PREFORMS TO FABRICATE LAMINATES FOR TEST AND EVALUATION. THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOW-COST FABRICATION PROCESSES FOR HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPOSITES IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE IN THE ECONOMICAL USE OF COMPOSITES IN AEROSPACE STRUCTURES. PHASE I TASKS ARE TO BUILD TWO TOOLS, FROM TEST PANELS OF DIFFERENT THICKNESSES, AND CONDUCT STRUCTURAL TESTS, TO EXPLORE THE RESULTING PERFORMANCE. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO DEVELOP AND DEMONSTRATE INJECTION PROCESSES TO RESIN TRANSFER MOLDING OF THICK, HIGH DENSITY, CARBON FIBERS, FILAMENT WOUND PREFORMS. PHASE II OBJECTIVES WILL BE TO SCALE UP AND OPTIMIZE THE RESIN INJECTION PROCESS TO ACHIEVE LOWER COSTS CONSISTENT WITH AEROSPACE QUALITY AND TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT DATA TO ALLOW MATERIALS AND PROCESS SPECIFICATIONS TO BE WRITTEN.",

RECENT STUDIES SUGGEST THAT THE PRIMARY PATHOGENESIS OF THIS DISORDER IS UTEROPLACENTAL PERFUSION INSUFFICIENCY RESULTING IN GENERAL MATERNAL VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL CELL DAMAGE. ALTHOUGH MORE THAN 100 TESTS HAVE BEEN PUT FORTH AS PREDICTORS OF PE, THERE IS AS YET NO RELIABLE MARKER OF EARLY DETECTION OF PE.

SOME ENDOTHELIAL PROTEINS WERE FOUND TO BE INCREASED IN THE PLASMA IN LATE GESTATION IN WOMEN WITH PE, BUT ELEVATION OF THESE MARKERS DID NOT PRECEDE THE ONSET OF OTHER CLINICAL SYMPTOMS. TO BROADEN THE SCOPE OF PHASE I STUDY INVESTIGATORS EXPANDED THE PANEL OF CLINICAL SPECIMENS UNDER INVESTIGATION TO INCLUDE URINE AS WELL AS SERUM, WITH THE ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE OF DEVELOPING AN NON INVASIVE TEST.

UNFORTUNATELY, SILICON-BASED DETECTORS ARE HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO RADIATION DAMAGE, CAN OPERATE ONLYIN A NARROW TEMPERATURE REGIME, AND HAVE UNDESIRABLE SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIOS EVEN AT ROOM TEMPERATURE. A NEW CLASS OF RADIATION-RESISTANT, HIGH TEMPERATURE DETECTORS BASED ON WIDE BANDGAP SEMICONDUCTOR MATERIALS WOULD NOT ONLYENHANCE DETECTIVITY AND RESPONSIVITY IN CURRENT SYSTEMS, BUTWOULD DRAMATICALLY EXPAND THE FIELD OF USE. A CHARGED PARTICLE TRACKING DETECTOR BASED ON AN ACTIVE POSITIVE-NEGATIVE (PN) JUNCTION DETECTOR ELEMENT FABRICATED FROM DIAMOND FILM IS BEING DEVELOPED IN THIS PROJECT. BECAUSE OF ITS HIGH INTRINSIC RESISTIVITY, LARGE CARRIER MOBILITIES, HIGH SATURATED CARRIER DRIFT VELOCITY, AND RADIATION AND CHEMICAL CORROSION RESISTANCE, DIAMOND IS AN IDEAL CANDIDATE FOR AN EXTREMELY FAST, RADIATION-HARDENED PARTICLE DETECTOR. IT HAS RECENTLY BEEN SHOWN THAT DIAMOND FILMS WITH BOTH P- AND N-TYPE CONDUCTIVITY CAN BE GROWN. PHASE I OF THIS PROJECT INCLUDES THE FABRICATION OF PN JUNCTION DETECTORS AND MEASUREMENT OF THE RESPONSIVENESS OF THE FILMS TO IONIZING RADIATION. IN PHASE II, MICROSTRIP DETECTORS WILL BE CONSTRUCTED FROM DIAMOND ELEMENTS HAVING OPTIMIZED DOPING LEVELS. DIAMOND DETECTOR ELEMENTS WILL BE COMMERCIALIZED IN PHASE III FOR USE IN APPLICATIONS AS DIVERSE AS COMPUTER-ASSISTED TOMOGRAPHY (CAT) SCANNERS, IN-VIVO RADIATION DOSIMETERS, OR SOLID STATE LABORATORY RADIATION MONITORS.",

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS RESEARCH IS NOW COMPROMISED BY A SHORTAGE OF SUITABLE CRYSTALS TO MAKE DEVICES FOR LONG WAVELENGTH SPECTROSCOPY INTHE SOFT X-RAY REGION OF 6 TO 30 ANGSTROM. THE CRYSTAL, YTTRIUM BORIDE (YB66), HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A POTENTIAL MONOCHROMATOR FOR DISPERSING SYNCHROTRON RADIATION. KEY PROPERTIES OF THIS COMPOSITION INCLUDE (1) A MELTING TEMPERATURE OF 2100 DEGREES CENTIGRADE, (2) STABILITY TO SYNCHROTRON RADIATION, (3) A CELL PARAMETER OF 23.44 ANGSTROM, (4) A TWO-DIMENSIONAL SPACING OF 11.76 ANGSTROM (400 REFLECTION), AND (5) NO ABSOPRTION EDGES FROM BORON OR YTTRIUM IN THE 100 TO 2,000 EV WINDOW. UNFORTUNATELY, A LACK OF COMMERCIAL SUPPLIERS OF SINGLE CRYSTAL YB66 MATERIALEXISTS BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTY OF GROWING CRYSTALS AT TEMPERATURES HIGHER THAN 2,000 DEGREES CENTIGRADE. THIS PROBLEM IS BEING ADDRESSED BY THE USE OF A NOVEL GRADIENT TEMPERATURE CONTROL. BY APPLYING THIS CONTROL TO THE GROWING OF REFRACTORY CRYSTALS, THE CAPABILITY OF QUICKLY BECOMING A SUPPLIER OF YB66 CRYSTALS TO X-RAY SYNCHROTRON FACILITIES AND INTERESTED OTHERS WILL BE DEVELOPED.

The simplicity of chaff and the expected long term use of weapon systems which can be defeated by chaff guarantee its utility for many years to come. Advanced Technology Materials (ATM), Inc. has already developed a process for fiber metallization which is suitable for Production of degradable millimeter wave smoke materials\" Applicability of these fibers has been demonstrated by the U.S. Army CRDEC. The method of manufacture enables uniform coating on a wide variety of filamentous substrates. Thus, conductive metal coatings can be deposited onto degradable fibers permitting testing and training of personnel without concern of long term environmental impact. In Phase I, ATM will survey Potentially suitable substrate materials with proven degradability. Metallization of selected materials will be investigated. Process optimization will be Performed to yield a demonstration sample and long term feasibility evaluation. In Phase II, Product optimization and scale-up will be addressed along with further development of stable packaging for the degradable chaff material.",

THIS PROJECT IS BASED ON TWO INNOVATIONS. THE FIRST IS THE APPLICATION OF FOURIER TRANSFORM-INFRARED (FT-IR) DIAGNOSTICS TO THE CHARACTERIZATION OF COAL LIQUEFACTION PROCESS STREAMS. THE MID-IR WAVELENGTHS (1 TO 20 MUM) CONTAIN A WEALTH OF INFORMATION ABOUT CHEMICAL BONDS AND TEMPERATURE.

THE USE OF FIBER OPTICS ALLOWS THE TRANSMISSION OF THE IR LIGHT THROUGH A PROCESS STREAM UNDER DIFFICULT OPERATING CONDITIONS (HIGH TEMPERATURE AND HIGH PRESSURE).

THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH A DOUBLE SIZE SPECTROMETRY SYSTEM. PARTICLES ARE FIRST SIZED BY THEIR STOKES DIAMETER, AND THEN SIZED BY THEIR AERODYNAMIC DIAMETER. THE FIRST MEASURE, NAMELY THE STOKES DIAMETER SIZING, GIVES THE GEOMETRIC DIAMETER OF THE PARTICLE FOR ROUND PARTICLES. THE SECOND MEASURE, THE AERODYNAMIC SIZING, IS DEPENDENT ON PARTICLE DENSITY AS WELL AS STOKES DIAMETER. THE RESULT IS A DISTRIBUTION OF PARTICLE DENSITIES AT EACH SELECTED STOKES DIAMETER. THE STOKES SIZING IS DONE BY AN ELECTRICAL MOBILITY SEPARATION, THE AERODYNAMIC SIZING IS DONE USING A SINGLE-STAGE HYPERSONIC IMPACTOR. THE ELECTRICAL MOBILITY SPEARATION PRODUCES MONODISPERSE PARTICLES OF KNOWN STOKES SIZE WHICH ARE SAMPLED BY THE IMPACTOR. THE AERODYNAMIC SIZE FOR PARTICLE CAPTURE IS VARIED BY ADJUSTMENT OF THE IMPACTION PLATE POSITION.

WHILE MANY ADDITIVES HAVE BEEN USED TO IMPROVE THE HANDLING PROPERTIES OF CLAYS, THE LOSSES DUE TO CRACKING OF LARGE CERAMIC OBJECTS DURING DRYING REMAIN AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL. RECENTLY, A NEW ADDITIVE HAS BEEN INVENTED WHICH HAS BEEN PROVEN BY OUR PILOT STUDIES TO GREATLY INCREASE THE RATE ANDUNIFORMITY OF DRYING OF CERTAIN WATER-BASED CLAYS USED FOR DECORATIVE CERAMICS. HOWEVER, VIRTUALLY NOTHING IS KNOWN ABOUT THE MECHANISM BY WHICH THIS ADDITIVE WORKS NOR HOW TO SUCCESSFULLY APPLY IT TO CERAMICS OF INDUSTRIAL IMPORTANCE. THEREFORE, A SCIENTIFIC STUDY IS PLANNED TO EXPLORE THE INTERACTION OF THIS NEW ADDITIVE WITH WATER-BASED CLAYS AND TO DEVELOP A MODEL OF THIS MECHANISM. THE MODEL WILL THEN BE USED TO GUIDE THE EXPERIMENTAL WORK NEEDED TO SUCCESSFULLY USE THIS ADDITIVE WITH SELECTED CERAMICS WITH LARGE COMMERCIAL MARKETS.",

THIS NEED COULD BE MET WITH BIOSENSORS WHICH MAKE USE OF THE SELECTIVE FUNCTIONALITY OF BIOLOGICAL MOLECULES TO DETECT AND QUANTIFY THESE TOXINS. A WEAKNESS OF MOST EXISTING BIOSENSORS IS THAT THEY DO NOT MONITOR THE SPECIFIC FUNCTION OR ACTIVITY OF THE SENSING BIOMOLECULE DIRECTLY, BUT INDIRECTLY SURVEY THE REACTIVITY OF THE BIOMOLECULE AND THE TARGETED MOLECULE THROUGH AN INTERMEDIARY, SUCH AS AN ENZYME, COMPETITIVE DYE OR FLUORESCENT LABEL.

NEURAL NETWORK TECHNIQUES ARE APPROPRIATE FOR COMPUTING THIS ESTIMATE BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CRYSTAL IMAGES AND THE AVAILABILITY OF TRAINING DATA.

TWO APPROACHES ARE BEING STUDIED IN PHASE I. IN BOTH CASES, SIGNAL CAPTURE UTILIZES AN ANALOG SAMPLING ARRAY, WHICH IS A TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED ESPECIALLY FOR PHYSICS LABORATORY USE, AND IS NOW THE BASIS OF A UNIQUE LINE OF COMMERCIAL MEASURING INSTRUMENTS. THE FIRST VARIATION STUDIED IS THE DETECTION OF VALID DATA WITH A FRONT-END DISCRIMINATOR ON EVERY CHANNEL; THE DISCRIMINATOR,WORKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH A TIMING CLOCK, RECORDS THE TIME AT WHICH THE EVENT BEGINS, THEN TAKES A SPECIFIED NUMBER OF SAMPLES, WHICH ARE STORED IN AN ANALOG MEMORY. THE TIME VALUES ARE STORED SEPARATELY. AFTER THE DRIFT PERIOD IS OVER, THE ANALOG SAMPLES ARE READ OUT AND CONVERTED IN AN ANALOG-TO-DIGITAL CONVERTOR; THE AMPLITUDE VALUES AND TIME STAMP ARE STORED IN A LOCAL MEMORY FOR FURTHER COLLECTION AND PROCESSING. IN THE SECOND APPROACH, THE ENTIRE DRIFT PERIOD IS DIGITIZED, AND THE SAMPLES OF INTEREST ARE DETECTED ON READOUT. AT THIS TIME, SIGNALS BELOW THRESHOLD ARE DISCARDED, AND THE VALID DATA ALONG WITHTHE CALCULATED TIME VALUE(S) ARE STORED AS BEFORE.

THE PROFILES WILL BE DEVELOPED BASED ON EXISTING KNOWLEDGE GLEANED FROM A LARGE DATA BASE OF SHOCK TUBE, FIELD TEST, AND WIND TUNNEL TEST DATA AS WELL AS THEORETICAL ANALYSIS. PROVEN BLAST LOADING CODES AND BLAST RESPONSE CODES WILL BE EMPLOYED TO CALCULATE THE BLAST RESPONSE OF THE DEVELOPED SECTION PROFILES THROUGH AN OVERPRESSURE RANGE EXTENDING TO 150 PSI.

BRAIN TUMORS, WHICH ARE PROTECTED BY THE BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER, REQUIRE ADDITIONAL EMPHASIS. BORON NEUTRON CAPTURE THERAPY (BNCT) RELIES ON THE CAPTURE OF A THERMAL NEUTRON BY BORON, WHICH HAS BEEN PRE-POSITIONED BIOCHEMICALLY IN THE TUMOR, FISSIONING INTO ENERGETIC LITHIUM IONS AND -PARTICLES. BECAUSE THE RANGE OF THESE FISSION FRAGMENTS IS RELATIVELY SMALL (I.E., FEW MUM), THE CLINICAL EFFICACY OF THE THERAPY IS GUARANTEED ONLY IF THE BORON IS POSITIONED IN A SENSITIVE AREA OF THE TUMOR CELL, SUCH AS THE CELL NUCLEUS. A MAJOR TECHNICAL ISSUE AFFECTING BNCT CLINICAL EFFICACY IS THE QUESTION OF BORON CONCENTRATION AND ITS VARIABILITY AS A FUNCTION OF INTER/INTRACELLULAR LOCATION. TO DATE, IT HAS NOT BEEN POSSIBLE TO ACCURATELY DETERMINE THE LOCATION AND QUANTITY OF BORON WITHIN AN INDIVIDUAL CELL AND TO DETERMINEITS VARIABILITY.

WE PROPOSE TO PERFORM RESEARCH ON THE NEW INDUCTION SYNCHROTRON ACCELERATOR (ISA) CONCEPT WITHTHE OBJECTIVE OF MEETING THIS NEED. THE ISA OPERATES BY RECIRCULATING AN ELECTRON BEAM PULSE ( 30 NS LONG) THROUGH INDUCTION-TYPE ACCELERATION CELLS WHICH ARE DRIVEN BY A PULSE GENERATOR AT 10 MHZ. THE CLOSED-ORBIT, TRANSPORT MAGNET DESIGN IS SIMILAR TO THAT FOR CONVENTIONAL SYNCHROTRONS, AND BEAM PULSES ARE INJECTED AND EXTRACTED USING KICKER MAGNETS. AN ISA CAN BE RECYCLED AT UP TO 5 KHZ TO GENERATE HIGH AVERAGE BEAM POWERS. THE KEY ISSUE FOR THE ISA CONCEPT IS ACHIEVING THE REQUIRED PULSE REPETITION RATE OVER MANY RECIRCULATIONS. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A NEW PULSE GENERATOR CONCEPT BASED ON THE USE OF HIGH-SPEED, POWER-MOSFET SWITCHES COMBINED WITH MAGNETIC PULSE COMPRESSION TECHNIQUES. THE FOLLOWING RESEARCH TASKS WILL BE PERFORMED IN PHASE I TO ASSESS THE TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY OF THE ISA CONCEPT: (1) DEMONSTRATE THAT SWITCHES FORMED USING SERIES-PARALLEL ARRAYS OF POWER-MOSFET DEVICES ARE SUITABLE FOR ISA APPLICATIONS; (2) PERFORM EXPERIMENTS TO CHARACTERIZE AND EVALUATE A SMALL-SCALE ISA DRIVER CIRCUIT AND (3) DEVELOP A CONCEPTUAL DESIGN FOR A PHASE II PROOF-OF-PRINCIPLE ISA EXPERIMENT.

HOWEVER, SINCE THE DIELECTRIC STRENGTH OF LIQUIED IS GENERALLY MUCH LESS THAN FOR SOLIDS, THE MAXIMUM OOPERATING ELECTRIC FIELD IS LIMITED BY THE IMPREGNANT. THIS, IN TURN, LIMITS THE ENERGY DENSITY THAT IS ATTAINABLE.

EXISTING APPROACHES FOR REDUCING VOC EMISSIONS, SUCH AS THE USE OF CUT-BACK SOLVENT TECHNOLOGY AND HIGH TEMPERATURE COATING PROCESSES, HAVE LIMITATIONS AND PROBLEMS. THUS, IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO DEVELOP NEW COATING PROCESSES WHICH TOTALLY ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR VOCS.

IS DEVELOPING A SYSTEM WHICH FEATURES EXCEPTIONAL BACKGROUND REDUCTION AND ABOUT A THOUSAND FOLD INCREASE IN DETECTION SENSITIVITY OF THE LABELED MOLECULES, E. G. ANTIBODIES TO ENDOGENOUS OPIOID PEPTIDES, PEPTIDE PRECURSORS AND PROCESSING ENZYMES. WITH THE MPD (MULTI GAMMA PHOTON DETECTOR) BACKGROUND COUNTS ARE REDUCED TO A FEW COUNTS PER DAY, BY ONLY RECORDING EVENTS COMPATIBLE WITH A COINCIDENT 'TRIPLE GAMMA'SIGNATURE OF THE IODINE ISOTOPE UTILIZED AS A LABEL. MEMBERS OF THE TRIPLE GAMMA FAMILY HAVE HALF-LIVES RANGING FROM MINUTES TO DAYS. AS ATOMS THEY HAVE DIVERSE CHEMISTRIES AND CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO DIVERSE MOLECULES THROUGH STANDARD CHEMISTRIES. THE HALOGEN ISOTOPES ARE READILY ADDUCED TO PERFORMED MACRO-MOLECULES, SUCH AS THE ANTIGENS AND ANTIBODIES UTILIZED IN RADIOIMMUNOASSAYS (RIA). THESE SYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS CONFER THE FOLLOWING ADVANTAGES. THE QUANTITY OF ISOTOPE IS REDUCED, BECAUSE THE BACKGROUND COUNT IS VIRTUALLY ELIMINATED. THERE IS A CORRESPONDING REDUCTION IN ISOTOPE PURCHASE AND RADIOISOTOPE DISPOSAL COSTS. MINUTE TRACES OF BIOLOGICAL MOLECULES CAN BE QUANTITATED AT MUCH LOWER CONCENTRATE.",

THIS INSTRUMENT WILL PRODUCE VOXEL-BY-VOXEL X-RAY DATA SO THAT A THREE-DIMENSIONAL IMAGE OF THE ROCKET CAN BE MADE IN REAL-TIME DURING FIRING. THE PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION, FLASH LAMINOGRAPHY, COMBINES TWO IDEAS: (1) SIMULTANEOUSLY-STROBED X-RAY SOURCES TO PRODUCE SHARP PICTURES ON A BLUR SCALE CONSISTENT WITH FINE SPATIAL RESOLUTION DURING THE BURN, AND (2) TOMOSYNTHESIS, A RECONSTRUCTIVE TECHNIQUE INTERMEDIATE TO THE PRINCIPLES USED IN COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) AND CONVENTIONAL FILM LAMINOGRAPHY. FLASH LAMINOGRAPHY (FL) IS DISTINGUISHED FROM EITHER TECHNIQUE, HOWEVER, IN THAT IT OFFERS THE POTENTIAL FOR VIEWING TOMOGRAPHIC IMAGES OF ANY PLANE OR SURFACE OF THE TEST SPECIMEN IN REAL-TIME, INCLUDING A LONGITUDINAL CROSSSECTION CONTAINING THE ROCKET'S AXIS OF SYMMETRY. THUS, ROCKETS AND COMPONENTS CAN BE EXAMINED DURING STATIC FIRE. AS A PERIPHERAL EFFORT, THE PROPOSAL ALSO PERFORMS A PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION OF A PURELY ELECTRONIC IMAGING TECHNIQUE THAT PROMISES EXTREMELY FAST, LOW RESOLUTION, TOMOGRAPHIC IMAGES OF LIVE, EXTRATERRESTRIAL FIRES. THE PHASE I PROGRAM EMPHASIZES AN EXPERIMENTAL DEMONSTRATION OF PROOF-OF-PRINCIPLE OF THE PRIMARY EFFORT AND SETS THE STAGE FOR A PHASE II FEASIBILITY/CAPABILITY EXPERIMENT. THE PHASE I PROGRAM WILL ALSO DETERMINE AN EXPERIMENTAL CONFIGURATION FOR THE ALTERNATIVE, EXTRATERRESTRIAL SYSTEM. BOTH OF THESE NEAR REAL-TIME TECHNIQUES COULD BE APPLIED TO NONINVASIVE CARDIAC EXAMINATION. THE FLASH LAMINOGRAPHY SYSTEM IS CAPABLE OF PROVIDING HIGH RESOLUTION, 3-D, FREEZE-FRAME, REAL-TIME HEART STOPPING ON 5 MSEC BLUR WITH 30 MSEC CENTERS. THE ELECTRONIC TECHNIQUE IS POTENTIALLY EVEN FASTER, BUT WITH LOWER RESOLUTION. ANY INDUSTRIAL PROCESS INVOLVING FLUID FLOW WITH SUSPENSIONS OR PARTICULATES IS A CANDIDATE FOR THESE METHODS.

        "abstract": "INCREASING USE OF FURA-2 AND OTHER DUAL EXCITATION PROBES HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE ADVANTAGES OF THE RATIO METHOD FOR DETERMINING INTRACELLULAR ION CONCENTRATIONS. THIS HAS FOSTERED THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PROBES (E. G., FOR NA+, K+, H+, AND MG2+) WITH WHICH ION CONCENTRATIONS ARE DETERMINED AS A FUNCTION OF THE RATIO OF THE FLUORESCENCE EMISSION EXCITED BY ILLUMINATION AT TWO WAVELENGTHS (DUAL EXCITATION). UNFORTUNATELY, THE DEVELOPMENT OF RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE ULTRAVIOLET (UV) AND VISIBLE FLUORESCENCE ILLUMINATION SYSTEMS FOR USE WITH THESE PROBES LAGS BEHIND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROBES THEMSELVES. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE WHEN THE PROBES ARE USED FOR DIGITAL IMAGING, WHERE EXCITATORY ILLUMINATION MUST BE GATED SYNCHRONOUSLY WITH THE VIDEO FRAMES. TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, AN OPTIMIZED ACOUSTO-OPTIC TUNABLE FILTER (AOTF) WILL BE FABRICATED AND INCORPORATED INTO A NEW ULTRAVIOLET AND VISIBLE ILLUMINATOR FOR DUAL EXCITATION PROBES. THE ILLUMINATOR WILL BE DEMONSTRATED IN A FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY APPLICATION, WHERE THE USE OF AOTF TECHNOLOGY WILL PERMIT FAST AND ACCURATE CONTROL THE WAVELENGTH, TIMING AND INTENSITY OF THE EXCITATION.

BECAUSE OF SMALL PARTICLE SIZE, DIRECT MEASUREMENTS OF INDIVIDUAL PARTICLES HAVE BEEN RESTRICTED TO MORPHOLOGY AND ELEMENTAL COMPOSITION. ORGANIC ANALYSIS HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED MOSTLY BY SOLVENT EXTRACTION, THEREBY FORCING RELIANCE ON THE EFFICACY OF THE EXTRACTION CHEMISTRYTO ENSURE APPROPRIATE ANALYTICAL SIGNALS. THUS, IN THE REALM OF ORGANIC ANALYSIS, CONCLUSIONS ARE USUALLY INFERRED,AND RESULTS CAN BE AMBIGUOUS. CURRENTLY, NO ESTABLISHED TECHNIQUE EXISTS FOR THE DIRECT ANALYSIS OF ORGANIC SPECIES ON INDIVIDUAL FLYASH PARTICLES. A NEW TIME-OF-FLIGHT SECONDARY ION MASS SPECTROMETER (TOF-SIMS) HAS RECENTLY BEENBUILT WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR FILLING THIS VOID. A SAMPLE ISBOMBARDED IN VACUUM BY A PULSED BEAM OF PRIMARY IONS AT VERYLOW FLUX DENSITY SO AS TO EJECT SECONDARY IONS NOMINALLY FROM THE OUTER MONOLAYER OF A SOLID SAMPLE. CHEMICAL INTEGRITY IS PRESERVED BY THE SMALL NUMBER OF PRIMARY ION IMPACTS PER UNIT OF SAMPLE AREA. TOF-SIMS ENABLES ALL SECONDARY ION MASSES TO BE DETECTED, PROVIDING THE MOST EFFICIENT USE OF \"CONSUMED\" SAMPLE MATERIAL. BECAUSE MASSESCAN BE RECORDED UP TO THOUSANDS OF ATOMIC MASS UNITS AND THESECONDARY ION SPUTTERING PROCESS CAN REMOVE WHOLE MOLECULAR CLUSTERS, TOF-SIMS HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR ELEMENTAL, ISOTOPIC, CHEMICAL COMPOUND, AND ORGANIC MICROANALYSIS. SINGLE ION COUNTING YIELDS EXCELLENT DETECTION SENSITIVITY, AND INDIVIDUAL PARTICLES CAN BE ANALYZED USING EITHER A FINELY FOCUSSED PRIMARY ION BEAM (ION MICROPROBE) OR STIGMATIC SECONDARY ION OPTICS (ION MICROSCOPE) IN THE SAME INSTRUMENT. IN COLLABORATION WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA, THIS PROJECT ASSESES THE UTILITY OF TOF-SIMS FOR FLYASH CHARACTERIZATION USING MODEL CHEMICAL SYSTEMS, CONTROLLED EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN, AND COMPARATIVE ANALYTICAL PROTOCOLS.

TO ACCOMPLISH THIS TASK, CREVICULAR FLUID SAMPLES WILL BE COLLECTED FROM 20 HEALTHY SUBJECTS, 30 SUBJECTS WITH GINGIVITIS AND 50 SUBJECTS WITH PERIODONTITIS. IL-1-BETA LEVELS WILL BE DETERMINED SIMULTANEOUSLY USING A NEWLY DEVELOPED \"DIP STICK\" KIT AND VERIFIED WILL A HIGH SENSITIVITY STANDARD ELISA. THE SIMULTANEOUS USE OF BOTH ASSAYS WILL ALLOW US TO REFINE THE SENSITIVITY AND LIMITATIONS FOR DETECTION OF ONLY DISEASED SITES. THE \"DIP STICK\" ASSAY TAKES LESS THAN 60 MINUTES TO COMPLETE. A POSITIVE TEST (I. E. ELEVATED LEVELS OF IL-1-BETA) RESULTS IN A COLOR CHANGE VISIBLE TO THE UNAIDED EYE WHICH IS READ AGAINST A COLOR-CHART FOR SEMI-QUANTITATION.

THE EXPERT SYSTEM CONSISTS OF OBJECTORIENTED KNOWLEDGE BASES WHICH INTEGRATE MODELS OF INTERACTIVE INSTRUCTION, EDITORS FOR KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION AND STUDENT INFORMATION, CASE STUDIES OF PREVIOUSLY DESIGNED COURSES, INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN PROTOCOLS, INSTRUCTIONAL OBJECTS, AND PRODUCTION RULES INCORPORATING INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES. KASE FACILITATES THE COURSE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS BY CAPTURING DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE FROM THE USER/DEVELOPER AND AUTOMATICALLY ORGANIZING THIS KNOWLEDGE IN ACCORDANCE WITH INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES TO GENERATE A DETAILED DESIGN SPECIFICATION FOR INSTRUCTION. THE DESIGN SPECIFICATIONINCLUDES TASK ANALYSIS, COURSE DESCRIPTION, COURSE OBJECTIVES, TERMINAL AND ENABLING OBJECTIVES, RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS, AND DESIGN NOTES. NOREOVER, KASE QUERIES THE USER/DEVELOPER FOR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT STUDENT CHARACTERISTICS, TRAINING CONSTRAINTS, AND INSTRUCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (AUDIENCE DEMOGRAPHICS, COURSE PARAMETERS); BUILDS INSTRUCTIONAL OBJECTS FROM THIS KNOWLEDGE, AND REASONS OVER THESE OBJECTS TO DETERMINE THE MOST EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES TO USE FOR A GIVEN CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT ASSIGNMENT.

G. 410 NM) HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO BE A SENSITIVE ENDOSCOPIC METHOD FOR LOCATING BOTH TUMORS AND EARLY STAGES OF CANCER NOT READILY DETECTABLE BY OTHER TECHNIQUES. ALTHOUGH THE METHOD SHOWS PROMISE OF BEING ABLE TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF BIOPSY TECHNIQUES, THE CURRENT INSTRUMENTATION FOR FLUORESCENCE EXCITATION AND DETECTION REQUIRES LASERS AND ELECTRONICS TOO COSTLY FOR WIDESPREAD USE. CONSEQUENTLY, FLUORESCENCE-GUIDED BIOPSY TECHNIQUES CANNOT BE APPLIED ON A ROUTINE BASIS SIMPLY AS AN AID TO IDENTIFYING MALIGNANT TISSUE. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO DEVELOP A LOW COST INSTRUMENTATION PACKAGE THAT CAN BE USED WITH A BIOPSY FORCEPS, EITHER IN A RIGID OR FLEXIBLE ENDOSCOPE, TO AID THE PHYSICIAN IN DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN MALIGNANT AND NORMAL TISSUE DURING ENDOSCOPIC EXAMINATIONS. THE METHOD INVOLVES A NON-LASER, EXCITATION LIGHT SOURCE AND RATIO FLUOROMETRY WITH BANDPASS FILTERS AND PHOTODIODES FOR DETECTION. THE GOAL OF PHASE I IS PROOF OF PRINCIPLE FOR THE METHOD USING A XENON ARC LAMP-BASED, FIBER OPTIC LIGHT SOURCE AND PREVIOUSLY REPORTED METHODS OF DETECTION; IN PHASE II, AN ENGINEERING PROTOTYPE WOULD BE DEVELOPED IN WHICH THE SOPHISTICATED DETECTION EQUIPMENT OF PHASE I WOULD BE REPLACED WITH APPROPRIATE PHOTODIODES AND SIMPLE DATA REDUCTION ELECTRONICS.

RELATED INVESTIGATIONS HAVE FURTHER DEMONSTRATED THAT SUBSTITUTION OF GRAPHITE-ALUMINUM MMC FOR ALUMINUM IN SPACE-BASED RADIATORS CAN IMPROVE THERMAL TRANSFER BY MORE THAN 25 PERCENT, AS WELL AS REDUCE RADIATOR WEIGHT. CONTINUED ANALYSIS IMPLIES THAT, BY SUBSTITUTING COPPER-MATRIX MMC FOR ALUMINUM-MATRIX MMC, A SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER HEAT TRANSFER RATE IS ATTAINABLE WITH ONLY A MODEST INCREASE IN RADIATOR WEIGHT. IMPROVEMENTS IN HEAT TRANSFER RESULT FROM HIGHER THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY PLUS THE ELEVATION OF RADIATOR OPERATING TEMPERATURE. OTHER BENEFITS ARE DERIVED FROM THE LOW, TAILORABLE COEFFICIENT OF THERMAL EXPANSION (CTE) OF THE MMC. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF PHASE I IS TO ESTABLISH HOW GRAPHITE-COPPER CAN IMPROVE SPACECRAFT THERMALMANAGEMENT, AND TO SHOW THE EXTENT OF THIS IMPROVEMENT WHEN COMPARED WITH EITHER ALUMINUM OR COPPER ALONE.",

TO DATE, THE MOSTPROMISING EXPERIMENTAL X-RAY DETECTORS BASED ON SUPERCONDUCTORS HAVE BEEN FABRICATED FROM TIN-BASED TUNNEL JUNCTIONS, WHICH DEGRADE WITH TIME AND THERMAL CYCLING. HOWEVER, NIOBIUM JUNCTION TECHNOLOGY, DEVELOPED OVER THE PAST EIGHT YEARS FOR DIGITAL LOGIC, HAS PROVED TO BE VERY STABLE. THIS PROJECT EXPLOITS CURRENT DEPOSITION TECHNIQUES, ALLOWING COMPLEX MULTILAYER ELECTRODES TO BE MADE USING TRANSITION METAL FILMS. SUCH MULTILAYER ELECTRODES ARE DESIGNED TO OPTIMIZE THE ANTICIPATED PERFORMANCE OF THE DETECTORS. PHASE INCLUDES VERY LOW TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENTS OF LEAKAGE CURRENTS IN JUNCTIONS MADE IN THIS PROJECT, DETERMINATIONS OF THE PERFORMANCE OF THE MOST PROMISING OF THESE JUNCTIONS (USING EQUIPMENT AT THE LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY), AND DESIGN OF AN OPTIMUM X-RAY DETECTOR (IN COLLABORATION WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT SAN DIEGO).",

RECENT ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY MAKE MULTIMEDIA COURSEWARE POSSIBLE USING PERSONAL COMPUTERS.

THE PROPOSED MODULAR MULTIMEDIA COURSEWARE SYSTEM (MMCS) ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK THROUGH WHICH COURSEWARE DEVELOPERS, EDUCATORS, AND STUDENTS CAN UTILIZE INTERACTIVE MULTIMEDIA COURSEWARE. DEVELOPERS CREATE MODULAR MULTIMEDIA LESSONS FOR DISTRIBUTION THROUGH A COMMON COURSEWARE REPOSITORY. EDUCATORS INTEGRATE THE LESSONS INTO CUSTOMIZED COURSES FOR THEIR STUDENTS. THE PHASE I OBJECTIVES ARE 1) TO DESIGN THE MMCS STANDARD WITH COURSEWARE MODULARITY, EASE OF DISTRIBUTION, AND IMPROVED LEARNING CAPABILITIES, AND 2) TO DEVELOP A WORKING MMCS PROTOTYPE TO DEMONSTRATE AND EVALUATE THE SYSTEM. THE WORK EFFORT WILL INVOLVE DEFINING THE MMCS STANDARD, DEMONSTRATING A FUNCTIONAL PROTOTYPE OF THE SYSTEM, DEVELOPING A SAMPLE REPOSITORY OF MODULAR LESSONS, AND EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SYSTEM.

SUCH DRUGS WOULD HOLD THE POSSIBILITY OF AVOIDING MANY OF THE SIDE EFFECTS OF HEPARIN OR THROMBOLYTIC THERAPY.

WHILE PROGRESS IN THE BIOCHEMISTRY OF FIBRIN POLYMERIZATION HAS PERMITTED IDENTIFICATION OF PEPTIDE SEQUENCES RESPONSIBLE FOR INTERCHAIN ASSOCIATION, THE INHIBITORY ABILITY OF THESE PEPTIDES ALONE IS NOT CLINICALLY RELEVANT, AS THEIR AFFINITY FOR INTACT FIBRIN IS TOO LOW.

A DIAMOND DEPOSITION REACTOR INSTRUMENTED SPECIFICALLY FOR EXPLORING DIAMOND DEPOSITION PLASMA CHEMISTRY HAS BEEN BUILT AND HAS PROVIDED IMPORTANT DATA ABOUT DIRECT CURRENT GLOW DISCHARGE DIAMOND DEPOSITION CHEMISTRY THAT HAS MATERIALLY IMPROVED PRODUCTION PROCESSES. THIS REACTOR IS BEING USED IN PHASE I TO CHARCTERIZE THE PLASMA CHEMISTRY OF MICROWAVE DIAMOND DEPOSITION AND TO CORRELATE PLASMA CHEMISTRY DATA WITH OBSERVED DIAMOND MATERIAL PROPERTIES.

VIDEO AND RADAR SENSOR SYSTEMS SUPPORT TRACKING. ACCURATE, REAL TIME TRACKING IS CRITICAL IN SUPPORTING RANGE SAFETY CALCULATIONS AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION. CURRENTLY OBJECTS ARE TRACKED USING POLYNOMIAL FILTERS (E.G. ALPHA-BETA FILTERS). POLYNOMIAL MODELS ARE USED BECAUSE THEY: ARE EASY TO CONSTRUCT, ARE COMPUTATIONALLY EFFICIENT, AND DO NOT REQUIRE DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF THE TARGET'S DYNAMICS. THE PRICE OF THIS SIMPLICITY IS THAT THEY RELY ON THE DATA TO CONTINUALLY CORRECT THE STATE ESTIMATE FOR UNMODELED EFFECTS.

THE DEVICE USES OPTICS AND LASERDOPPLER INFORMATION TO PRECISELY DETERMINE THE RELATIVE VELOCITY AND DISTANCE BETWEEN THE FUZE AND A TARGET. AN ACOUSTIC CHARGE TRANSPORT (ACT) MICROPROCESSOR IS PROPOSED TO GREATLY ENHANCE THE VELOCITY RESOLUTION AND IMPROVE THE SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO OF THE CURRENT PROTOTYPE FUZE. THE RESULTING LASER/ACT FUZE PACKAGE WILL BE EXTREMELY SMALL, LIGHTWEIGHT, AND INEXPENSIVE. THE PHASE I PROJECT WILL ADDRESS THE FEASIBILITY OF USING AN ACT DEVICE TO ENHANCE THE FUZE RECEIVER PERFORMANCE BY FILTERING THE DOPPLER VELOCITY INFORMATION. AN ANALYSIS WILL QUANTIFY THE EXPECTED PERFORMANCE INCREASES. SEVERAL DIFFERENT STRATEGIESFOR UTILIZING THE EXTERNAL PROGRAMMABILITY WILL BE CONSIDERED IN THE ANALYSIS. FOR EXAMPLE, PROGRAMMABILITY MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE SINGLE FUZE DESIGN FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF PLATFORMS AND MISSIONS. THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS WILL BE USED TO GENERATE A PRELIMINARY DESIGN OF APRACTICAL FUZING SYSTEM. A PROTOTYPE RECEIVER WILL BE CONSTRUCTED WITH AN ACT MICROPROCESSOR DEVICE SUPPLIED BY ELECTRONIC DECISIONS INCORPORATED (EDI). THE ACT RECEIVER, INTERFACED WITH AN EXISTING OPTICS/LASER SUBSYSTEM, WILL THEN BE MEASURED TO VALIDATE THE ANALYSIS. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - THE LASER/ACT FUZE DESIGN WILL BE SUITABLE FOR WIDESPREAD APPLICATION TO GRAVITY BOMBS,ANTI-ARMOR AND ANTI-AIR MISSILES.

        "abstract": "The proposed Phase I effort will define a single channel sonobuoy processor that is capable of processing any of the current and planned sonobuoys. In addition to the pure processing function, the processor will be capable of storing a signifi- cant amount of display data and of being reconfigured, to process data from dif- ferent sensors, in a short amount of tLme. The processing system must also be capable of performing auxiliary functions, such as synchronizing with sonobuoy downlink coimnands, and performing I/0 to display, post processing, and control functions. Synchronization between sensors, for cross correlation, for instance, will also be provided. In essence, these analyses will result in the determination of a system architecture, allocating functions between the single channel Modular Acoustic Processor (MAP) and the common support functions and defining inter- function interfaces. As a precursor to definition of the processor, the initial Phase I effort will be to determine what functions the processor must implement, and what functional and physical performance is needed to meet the operational requirements. This will result in a specific recommendation for the internal structure of the processor, including interfaces, processing resources, and storage. Also included in the processor design will be the run time software structure, and the assign- ment of functions among the various levels of software that will execute on the processor.",

METHYLCYTOSINES ARE LOCATED IN REGULATORY REGIONS SUCH AS PROMOTERS, AND HYPOMETHYLATION IN THESE REGIONS ARE AMONG THE EARLY EVENTS IN CARCINOGENESIS. THE SPECIFIC AIMS ARE TO: 1) SYNTHESIZE ANTIGENS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES SPECIFIC FOR 5-METHYLCYTOSINE, 2) PRODUCE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES REACTIVE WITH METHYLCYTOSINE, AND 3) TO APPLY THESE ANTIBODIES TO MODEL SYSTEMS WHICH HAVE ALTERATIONS IN DNA METHYLATION WHICH CORRELATE TO TRANSFORMATION. THESE METHODS SHOULD CONTRIBUTE TO KNOWLEDGE RELATING DNA METHYLATION TO CARCINOGENESIS AND METASTASIS. THE ANTIBODIES WILL BE EMPLOYED TO MEASURE GLOBAL CHANGES IN GENOMIC DNA METHYLATION BY MULTIPARAMETER FLOW CYTOMETRY AND AT HIGH RESOLUTION BY ANTIBODY-BLOCKED PCR AND LCR. THESE ANTIBODIES BASED METHODS WILL BE DEVELOPED IN PHASE I. PHASE II WILL BE CONCERNED WITH APPLICATIONS OF THESE METHODOLOGIES AND EXPANDED TO STUDIES IN TRANSFORMED CELL LINES AND RODENTS. THE REAGENTS AND TECHNIQUES TO BE DEVELOPED WILL HAVE IMMEDIATE COMMERCIAL APPLICATION TO CANCER DIAGNOSIS AND ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY.",

SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES AND METHODS OF THIS RESEARCH INCLUDE (1) ESTABLISHING A PERFORMANCE BASELINE FOR CURRENT NOISE RESISTANCE AGAINST TYPICAL NOISE CONDITIONS FROM JEEPS, PLANES, TANKS, AND HELICOPTERS; (2) IMPLEMENTING AND EVALUATING ENHANCEMENTS THAT WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PUSH-TO-TALK SCENARIOS IN WHICH NOISE LEVELS COULD BE CONTINUOUSLY MONITORED PRIOR TO INITIATION OF RECOGNITION; (3) IMPLEMENTING AND EVALUATING TRADITIONAL NOISE CANCELING TECHNIQUES; (4) IMPLEMENTING AND EVALUATING THE EXTREMA THEORY OF VOICE COMPRESSIONS; AND (5) MODELING ENVIRONMENTALLY SPECIFIC BURST NOISE EVENTS SO THEY CAN BE IGNORED AND TESTING THE RESULTS. IF THE PHASE I EFFORT IS SUCCESSFUL, IT WILL BE POSSIBLE IN PHASE II TO REFINE AND EXTEND THESE ALGORITHMS TO COVER OTHER CONDITIONS, TEST THEM IN A REALISTIC ENVIRONMENT, AND DEVELOP AN APPROPRIATE HARDWARE/SOFTWARE IMPLEMENTATION FOR INTEGRATION INTO EQUIPMENT. THE ADDITION OF NOISE ROBUSTNESS AND STRESS-RESISTANCE TO SOLILOQUY TECHNOLOGY WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE ITS APPLICABILITY IN TACTICAL & COMMERCIAL ENVIRONMENTS WHERE SIMILAR ACOUSTIC CONDITIONS OCCUR. EXAMPLES INCLUDE BOTH COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY COCKPITS, FLIGHT LINE MAINTENANCE, INTRAVEHICLE COMMUNICATION--WHETHER MILITARY JEEPS AND TANKS OR COMMERCIAL TRUCKS WITH GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEMS, OR EVEN MAIL ROOMS AND FACTORIES.

THIS SYSTEM DIFFERS FROM CURRENT COMMERCIAL SCRUBBER AND DE-NOX TECHNOLOGIES IN THAT NO CHEMICAL REAGENTS OR ADSORBATES ARE REQUIRED, AND THE PROCESS CAN BE ACCOMMODATEDWITHIN THE CONFINES OF EXISTING PARTICULATE COLLECTION EQUIPMENT. ACIDIC GASES ARE OXIDIZED BY HYDROXYL (OH) RADICALS IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO THAT OCCURING IN SYSTEMS EMPLOYING ELECTRON BEAM TECHNOLOGY. HOWEVER, THE DIELECTRICBARRIER DISCHARGE EMPLOYED RESULTS IN THE GENERATION OF ENERGETIC ELECTRONS THROUGHOUT THE INTERELECTRODE VOLUME ANDDOES NOT REQUIRE AN EXTERNALLY GENERATED ELECTRON BEAM. PHOTOLYSIS IS PROVIDED TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY BY CONVERTING THE GENERATED OZONE INTO ADDITIONAL OH RADICALS.

THIS EFFORT IS BUILT ON EXTENSIVE RESEARCH INFORMATION OF A PROTOTYPE PLASMA TORCH AND FIELD EXPERIENCE OF CLEANING UP HAZARDOUS WASTES. EPI'S MOBILE SYSTEM COMBINES EXISTING ROTARY KILN TECHNOLOGY WITH AN ADVANCED PLASMA TORCH AND SEPARATOR. ON ACCOUNT OF ITS HIGH ELECTRON TEMPERATURE, THE INTEGRATED SYSTEM ACHIEVES THE COMPLETE DISSOCIATION OF WASTE INTO CHARGED MOLECULES AND IONS WHICH ARE SEPARABLE AND COLLECTIBLE IN STABLE AND BENIGN STATES. EPI'S UNDERSTANDING OF THE PHYSICS OF THE PLASMA TORCH PERMITS IT TO SCALE THE RESULTS FROM A LABORATORY DEVICE INTO A FIELD OPERATING UNIT. KEY BENEFITS OF EPI'S MOBILE HAZARDOUS WASTE REMEDIATION SYSTEM INCLUDE: FIELD OPERABILITY; DESTRUCTION REMOVAL EFFICIENCY (DRE) OF AT LEAST 99.99%; SUITABILITY FOR USE ON DIOXIN, HALOGENATED SOLVENTS, HYDROCARBON AND SIMILAR WORK STREAMS; HIGH LEVEL OF SAFETY WITH CONTINUOUS DIAGNOSTIC MONITORING; COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING EPA REGULATIONS; REMEDIATION COST COMPARABLE TO CURRENT TECHNOLOGIES ($500/TON).",

WE WILL EVALUATE AND DEVELOP AN ENZYME SENSOR IN WHICH DETECTION IS BASED ON INHIBITION OF THE ENZYME. THE ENZYME INHIBITION TECHNIQUE CAN BE USED FOR DETECTION OF A VARIETY TOXIC AGENTS INCLUDING INORGANIC MATERIALS SUCH AS HEAVY METALS, TOXIC ANIONS SUCH AS CYANIDE, AND ORGANIC SUBSTANCES SUCH AS PESTICIDES. THE GENERAL OBJECTIVE IS TO REDUCE WORKPLACE AND DRINKING WATER HEALTH HAZARDS BY DEVELOPING A NEW TECHNIQUE, BASED ON THE ENZYME INHIBITION EFFECT, FOR THE DETECTION OF TOXIC AGENTS.

THE FIRST MOST IMPORTANT STEP IN SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION OF THESE HIGHLY PROMISING MATERIALS IN MICRO-ELECTRONICS AND HYBRID OPTO-ELECTRONICS, IS THE FABRICATION OF HIGH QUALITY THIN FILMS ON SEMICONDUCTOR SUBSTRATE. IN THIS PROGRAM, THIN FILM WILL BE PREPARED BY PLASMA ASSISTED LASER DEPOSITION TECHNIQUE USING 265 NM UV LASER AT 10 HZ. IN THIS TECHNIQUE, A HIGH FLUX OF UV PHOTONS IS DIRECTED ONTO THE BISMUTH-CALCIUM-STUNTIUM- COPPER-OXIDE SUPERCONDUCTING TARGET WHICH IS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO SI SUBSTRATE. THIS TECHNIQUE HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY ADOPTED AT EXCEL FOR DEPOSITING THIN FILMS OF HIGH TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTOR ON VARIOUS INSULATING OXIDE SUBSTRATES. ONE ADVANTAGE OF THIS TECHNIQUE IS THAT PRECISELY CONTROLLED THIN FILMS OF DESIRED STOICHIOMETRY CAN BE DEPOSITED AT LOW PROCESSING TEMPERATURE WITHOUT THE NEED OF ANY HIGH TEMPERATURE (900 DEGREES CENTIGRADE) POST ANNEALING. THIS LOW TEMPERATURE PROCESSING HAS IMPLICATIONS RELATING TO HOW THIN (10-20 NM) A FILM CAN BE DEPOSITED ON SI BEFORE INTRODUCING SUBSTRATE-FILM INTERACTION.

THE ULTIMATE RESULT WILL BE THE ABILITY TO: (1) IDENTIFY HIGH RISK WORK CONDITIONS, (2) QUANTIFY THE PROBLEMS PROVIDING A RATIONAL MEANS OF ALTERING THESE CONDITIONS, AND (3) VERIFY THAT THE CHANGES WILL INDEED REDUCE THE RISKS. THUS, RATHER THAN WAITING UNTIL CTDS HAVE REACHED A DEBILITATING STATE, THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL PERMIT EARLY DETECTION AND PREVENTION. THE EFFORT IS FOCUSED ON VALIDATING THE GRIPMASTER(TM) IN MEASURING WRIST POSTURE AND GRIP FORCE AGAINST OTHER EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES. IN ADDITION PRELIMINARY FIELD TESTS WILL BE CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS THAT WILL HELP TO SHAPE THE DESIGN OF A FIELD COMPATIBLE MONITOR. THIS TYPE OF MONITOR HAS ENORMOUS COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL IN BOTH HELPING TO DESIGN BETTER PRODUCTS AND PREVENTING INJURIES.",

THE OBJECTIVE IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF MONOLITHIC INTEGRATED PHOTONIC-MICROWAVE DEVICES, WHICH WOULD GREATLY ENHANCE THE PERFORMANCE OF HIGH-SPEED FIBEROPTIC LINKS. FOR MICROWAVE APPLICATIONS, THERE IS AN INTEREST IN TRANSMITTING OPTICAL SIGNALS TO AND FROM MMIC CHIPS. THUS, OPTICAL INPUT AND OUTPUT PORTS FOR MONOLITHIC MICROWAVE INTEGRATED CIRCUITS (MMIC) WILL BE DEVELOPED. WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE USE OF MESFETS AND HEMTS, THE BASIC BUILDING BLOCKS OF MMICS, AS OPTICAL INPUT PORTS ON THESE CHIPS. USING FREE CARRIER INJECTION/DEPLETION AS THE BASIC INTERACTION MECHANISM, WE WILL ALSO STUDY THE DEVELOPMENT OF EXTERNAL MODULATORS ON MMICS AS OUTPUT PORTS. THE USE OF THIS MECHANISM INSTEAD OF THE ELECTROOPTICAL EFFECT PROVIDES A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE HYBRID DEVICES VIA WELL DEVELOPED, RELIABLE, AND COST EFFECTIVE SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING AND FABRICATING METHODS. DEVICE INTERACTION WILL BE STUDIED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EXTERNAL MODULATOR IN TERMS OF DYNAMIC RANGE, NOISE CHARACTERISTICS, AND OPERATING CONDITIONS.

THE PHASE I WILL DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS TECHNOLOGY BY (A) DESIGNING AND TESTING OF A SOL-GELTRANSFER MOLDING APPARATUS: (B) FABRICATING CYLINDRICAL PARTS OF ONE OXIDE COMPOSITION, (C) CHARACTERIZING THE TOUGHNESS, MICROSTRUCTURE, AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THE RESULTING COMPOSITES, AND (D) SUGGESTING DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE PHASE II PROGRAM. THE PHASE II PROGRAM WILL OPTIMIZE THE PROCESS FOR MAXIMUM STRENGTH, TOUGHNESS AND HIGH TEMPERATURE PERFORMANCE. WE WILL FABRICATE MORE STRENGTH, TOUGHNESS AND HIGH TEMPERATURE PERFORMANCE. WE WILL FABRICATE MORE COMPLEX GEOMETRIES (SUCH AS ROTOR BLADES) USING REINFORCING FIBERS AND TWO CERAMIC MATRICES OF INTEREST TO THE DARPA. THE SUCCESS OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH WILL PROVIDE THE DOD WITH A RAPID, COST-EFFECTIVE MEANS OF PRODUCING HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPLEX GEOMETRY CMCS.

THESE BEAM SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN USED SUCCESSFULLY TO MEASURE PLASMA POTENTIAL IN MAGNETICALLY CONFINED HIGH TEMPERATURE PLASMA. CURRENTLY, THE UTILITY OF THE HIBP DIAGNOSTIC IS BEING EXTENDED TO MEASURE FLUCTUATIONS OF SPACE POTENTIAL AND MAGNETIC FIELDS. HOWEVER, THE ABILITY OF AN HIBP SYSTEMTO MEASURE THESE FLUCTUATING PARAMETERS ON A SCHEDULE CONSISTENT WITH THE MAGNETIC FUSION PROGRAM'S NEEDS IS AT RISK BECAUSE OF THE UNRELIABLE NATURE, LOW CURRENT DENSITY, AND POOR OPERATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ZEOLITE THALLIUMION SOURCE PRESENTLY USED IN THIS DIAGNOSTIC. THIS PROJECT PLANS TO SOLVE THE OPERATIONAL PROBLEMS OF A ZEOLITE ION SOURCE BY REPLACING IT WITH A RELIABLE, STEADY-STATE, INDUCTIVELY DRIVEN RADIO FREQUENCY (RF) DISCHARGE IN A HEAVYMETAL VAPOR, FROM WHICH A HIGH CURRENT DENSITY OF IONS CAN BE EXTRACTED. THE CANDIDATE MATERIALS INCLUDE MERCURY (HG),LEAD (PB), AND BISMUTH (BI) IN ADDITION TO THALLIUM (TI). THESE ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS ARE CHOSEN BECAUSE OF THEIR CLOSE PROXIMITY TO TI IN THE PERIODIC TABLE OF THE NUCLIDES.

THE METASTABLE HELIUM ATOMS ARE FORMED WHEN A BEAM OF HE IONS ISNEUTRALIZED BY RESONANT CHARGE EXCHANGE WITH ATOMS IN A GAS CELL. IN THE PROCESS OF NEUTRALIZATION, ABOUT 1 TO 10% OF THE BEAM ATOMS ARE PRODUCED IN THE METASTABLE 2(1)S AND 2(3)S LEVELS. BECAUSE THE EXCITATION RATE FROM THE METASTABLE LEVEL IS TYPICALLY A FACTOR OF 10(3) TO 10(4) LARGER THAN TRANSITIONS FROM THE GROUND STATE, COLLISIONALLYINDUCED FLUORESCENCE FROM THE BEAM PROPAGATING THROUGH A PLASMA IS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED BY THE ENHANCED POPULATIONOF METASTABLE STATES. THE FLUORESCENCE SIGNAL FROM THE PROBE BEAM IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE LOCAL DENSITY AND IS USED TO MEASURE THE DENSITY FLUCTUATIONS LOCALLY IN A PLASMA. BOTH TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE FLUCTUATIONS SHOULD BE OBTAINABLE. IN ADDITION, THE EXCITATION RATES OF SOME SPECIFIC SPECTRAL TRANSITIONS OF HEARE VERY TEMPERATURE DEPENDENT. THEREBY, THE RATIO OF THE LINE INTENSITY OF THE HE TRANSITION THAT IS TEMPERATURE INDEPENDENT TO ONE THAT IS HIGHLY TEMPERATURE DEPENDENT COULD YIELD A SENSITIVE MEASUREMENT OF THE ELECTRON TEMPERATURE.

        "abstract": "GSI proposes the development of an IR/RF expendable utilizing chemical energy to produce both signals. Current studies have shown that GSI'S patented intermetallic fuels are capable of producing extremely high in-band intensities for most military bandwidths, even under high flow conditions. In addition, chemical seeding of the fuel produces high electron cross-section plumes across a variety of radar wavelengths. Critical issues identified for study in this proposal include plume length tailoring and its effect on RCS gerierated, mass flow of the fuel necessary to provide required IR and RF signatures. These areas will be explored utilizing the facilities available at GSI. Due to the space savings created by the use of the Hi-Therm fuels, a back-up design is planned combining conventional RF chaff in a module attached to an un-seeded Hi-Therm IR fuel. Potential benefits from a successful effort include a lightweight, low cost expendable capable of multispectral simulation. Use of the GSI fuels holds potential for safer manufacturing processes since all materials involved are rated as flam- mable solids. Potential military spinoff uses include ground based decoys for armored vehicle protection, as well as fixed site aircraft (airfield) protection.",

PRELIMINARY STUDIES USING THIS CHELATING DEVICE INDICATE THAT IRON REMOVAL BY SUCH METHODOLOGY IS FEASIBLE. OTHER PRELIMINARY STUDIES DONE IN DOGS USING CARTRIDGES WITH IMMOBILIZED DESFERRIOXAMINE SHOWED THAT IRON COULD BE REMOVED RAPIDLY BY SUCH TECHNIQUES. IN PHASE I, WE PLAN TO DEVELOP SEVERAL TYPES OF IMMOBILIZED CHELATORS. USING ACTIVATED AGAROSE AS A MACROMOLECULAR SUPPORT, WE WILL IMMOBILIZE SOME NEW ORAL CHELATORS (EHPG, PIH) AND ALPHA-AMINOACYL HYDROXAMATE, A CHELATOR LIGAND WITH HIGH IRON AFFINITY. WE WILL PREPARE A SERIES OF CARBOXYMETHYL-DEXTRANS WITH INCREASE CONTENT OF ACID GROPUS FOR THE BINDING OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF THE DESFERRIOXAMINE FOR IRON CHELATORS. WE WILL THEN MEASURE IRON BINDING CAPACITY OF EACH OF THE ABOVE CHELATING AGENTS IN BATCH EXPERIMENTS. IRON DEPLETION BY EACH OF THE CHELATORS WILL BE MEASURED USING SALINE SOLUTION WITH ALBUMIN WHICH CONTAINS VARIOUS CONCENTRATIONS OF IRON, BETWEEN 50 AND 500 MCG/DL. THE STRENGTH OF IRON BINDING WILL BE ESTIMATED BY THE ELUTED AMOUNT OF IRON BY WATER SOLUBLE CHELATORS, SUCH AS EDTA. CHELATORS THAT LOOK PROMISING IN THE BATCH EXPERIMENTS WILL BE IMMOBILIZED ONTO HOLLOW FIBER CARTRIDGES. CARTRIDGES FOR IMMOBILIZATION WILL BE THOSE MARKED FOR HEMODIALYSIS WITH HIGH ULTRAFILTRATION PERFORMANCE. EACH CARTRIDGE CONTAINS ABOUT 12,000, ASYMMETRIC POLY-SULFON HOLLOW FIBERS CONSISTING OF A THIN CAPILLARY MEMBRANE SURROUNDED BY A RELATIVE THICK, MACROPOROUS SHELL WHICH IMPARTS MECHANICAL STRENGTH TO THE MEMBRANE AND SERVES AS A SUPPORT TO THE CHELATING AGENT WHICH IS DEPOSITED IN THE MACROPORES AND AT THE OUTSIDE WALL OF THE FIBERS. THE NOMINAL PORE SIZE OF THE MEMBRANE IS LESS THAN 30 KILODALTONS, AND ALLOWS IRON AND OTHER METALS TO PASS THROUGH. HOLLOW FIBER CARTRIDGES WITH THE IMMOBILIZED CHELATORS WILL THEN BE TESTED. USING AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS OF IRON, THE DEVICE WILL BE TESTED FOR KINETICS OF IRON REMOVAL AND IRON BINDING CAPACITY. USING BLOOD FROM HEMODIALYSIS PATIENTS HAVING IRON OVERLOAD, THE DEVICES WILL BE TESTED FOR KINETICS OF IRON REMOVAL. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SOURCES OF IRON 0 REMOVED WILL BE EXPLORED BY MEASURING IRON IN INDIVIDUAL SERUM FRACTIONS SEPARATED BY HPLC IN RECIRCULATING BLOOD.

HOWEVER, IN PRACTICAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF FLUID-COUPLED SOURCES, SOME CONSIDERATION MUST BE GIVEN TO DEPLOYING THE SOURCE IN A MANNER THAT OVERCOMES THE INHERENT PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH A FLUID-COUPLED DESIGN. ONE MAJOR PROBLEM IS THAT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE ENERGY GOES INTO THE GENERATION OF BOREHOLE TUBEWAVES. THIS ENERGY LOSS RESULTS IN A REDUCED EFFICIENCY OF THE SOURCE. IN GENERAL, TUBEWAVES AREA SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN APPLICATIONS INVOLVING EITHER BOREHOLE SOURCES OR RECEIVERS.

The dilemma clearly recognized by AH-1W program managers is the requirement to properly maintain a growing fleet of aircrat under constrained budgets and anticipated reductions in manpower. Maintenance is a manpower intensive activity and reductions in manpower, unless anticipated and provided for, will result in an unacceptable reduction in material readiness and warfighting capability. There are two areas in which this reduction in manpower might be effectively countered; the application of automation to the maintenance process, and improvments in training. There are four general areas in which the proper application of microcoprocessor technology (automation) can improve the maintenance proecess: workload reduction, error reduction, incresed productivity, and the adding of new capabilities. Application of htis same technology can also be beneficially applied to training resulting in improved training while at the same time realizing an overall reduction in training requirements and time. The combined effect of these benefits is improved maintenance with a concurrent reduction in the manpower required.",

The AIDGU will automate training scenario generation, facilitate scenario modification and present an easily used interface to instructors. The AIDGU will be designed to interface with currently deployed engagement training aids. The proposed project (Phase I and Phase II) will result in a detailed task analysis of the automatic data generation process, a requirements specification for an AIDGU and a system to demonstrate the feasibility of building such a system. The Phase I effort will research,and analyze the current data generation process. It will evaluate, quantify and describe current and emerging hardware and software technologies with which to implement the AIDGU. The Phase I effort will also define an AIDGU product to be prototyped in Phase II. Phase I objectives will be accomplished in four tasks: 1) Research data generation requirements; 2) Derive AIDGU system level requirements; 3) Research and analyze alternative technologies and 4) define alternative approaches and designs, and produce the final report.",

EXISTING SOCIAL SKILLS TRAINING PROGRAMS GENERALLY DISREGARD STRATEGY INSTRUCTION AND JOB-RELEVANT PRACTICE. INTELLIPRO PROPOSES TO (A) IDENTIFY THE SPECIFIC SOCIAL SKILLS PERCEIVED BY EMPLOYERS AS CRITICAL FOR SUCCESSFUL EMPLOYMENT, (B) FORMULATE A TRAINING PROGRAM TO DEVELOP AND PROMOTE GENERALIZATION OF THESE SKILLS, AND (C) DEVELOP A SOFTWARE DESIGN AND SPECIFY A COMPUTER PLATFORM TOIMPLEMENT THE INSTRUCTION. TO INVESTIGATE THIS APPROACH, INTELLIPRO HAS ASSEMBLED A TEAM OF EXPERIENCED PROFESSIONALSWITH EXPERTISE IN SIMULATION AND COMPUTER SYTEMS DESIGN, SOCIAL SKILLS TRAINING AND INSTRUCTIONAL DEVELOPMENT, AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.",

THE HIGH GAIN AND FAST TIME RESPONSE OF THE MCP CAN BE EXPLOITED TO PRODUCE A COMPOUND DETECTOR FOR MEASURING EXTREMELY LOW LIGHT LEVELS INCLUDING DIRECT PHOTON COUNTING. THE EXTENDED SURFACE OF THE MCP OPENS POSSIBILITIES FOR SPATIALLY RESOLVED DETECTION OF SOURCES WHEN COUPLES TO PIN PHOTODIODE ARRAYS.

THE DESIGN OF THE PROBE INCLUDES THE USE OF SINGLE MODE FIBERS TO PROVIDE THE OBJECT AND REFERENCE BEAMS, A COHERENT FIBER BUNDLE FOR TRANSMISSION OF THE SCATTERED LIGHT AND A TWO DIMENSIONAL, SOLID STATE ARRAY DETECTOR FOR DIGITAL ANALYSIS OF THE IMAGE. THE RESULTING HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION IMAGES ARE STORED FOR PROCESSING AND PRESENTATION VIA COMPUTER INTERFACE. THE COMPACT PROBE IS DESIGNED FOR DIRECT INSERTION IN THE EXTERNAL EAR CANAL WITH CHANNELS FOR PRESSURIZATION AND ACOUSTIC STIMULATION. THIS MODE OF OPERATION WILL ALLOW THE EXAMINATION OF MINUTE CHANGES IN THE DYNAMICS OF THE MEMBRANE WHICH CAN BE CORRELATED WITH THE MORPHOLOGY OF HEARING DISORDERS AND/OR THE EFFICACY OF SURGICAL PROCEDURES. AN INTERFEROGRAM OF A VIBRATING SURFACE WILL BE PRODUCED IN THE EXPERIMENTAL PROTOTYPE AND A SIMULATED IMAGE TRANSFER TO A LINEAR DETECTOR ARRAY WILL BE ACHIEVED FOR DIGITAL STORAGE. THE FULL DEVELOPMENT OF THIS INNOVATIVE PROBE WILL CONTRIBUTE FUNDAMENTALLY TO THE ARSENAL OF OTOLARYNGOLOGICAL RESEARCHERS AND ULTIMATELY BE TRANSFERRED TO A CLINICAL SETTING.",

HIGH COSTS BECOMES AN ACUTE PROBLEM IN APPLICATIONS LIKE HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS SAMPLING CALORIMETERS, WHICH REQUIRE VERY LARGE ARRAYS OF DETECTOR ELEMENTS. ALTHOUGH SOME IMPROVEMENT RESULTS FROM LARGE VOLUME THROUGHPUT, THIS IMPACT IS NOT AS LARGE AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED BECAUSE SOME OF THE COST ARE ALREADY COMMON TO LARGE VOLUME LARGE SCALE INTEGRATION (LSI)MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS. TO REDUCE MAJOR COSTS FURTHER, BASIC DESIGN AND PROCESSING CHANGES ARE REQUIRED BEFORE COSTOBJECTIVES CAN BE MET. THE COST PROBLEM HAS THE FOLLOWING SEGMENTS: GOOD QUALITY AND HIGH RESISTIVITY SI CRYSTALS, CUTTING AND POLISHING OPERATIONS, WAFER FABRICATION OPERATIONS FOR CONVERTING THE POLISHED WAFERS INTO DETECTORS, AND TESTING AND QUALITY CONTROL. IT IS POSTULATED THAT THE LSI STYLE OF WAFER CUTTING AND POLISHINGCURRENTLY IN USE IS NOT OPTIMAL FOR RADIATION DETECTORS AND IS THEREFORE A GOOD TARGET FOR MAJOR COST REDUCTION, PARTICULARLY IF COORDINATED WITH CHANGES IN THE WAFER FABRICATION DESIGN. IT IS ALSO SUGGESTED THAT THE DETECTOR DESIGNS AND FABRICATION PROCESSES IN COMMON USE ARE TOO COMPLICATED FOR SIMPLE PAD AND PIXEL DETECTORS AND THAT MAJOR COST IMPROVEMENTS CAN BE ACHIEVED BY SIMPLIFYING THE DESIGN AND THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS.

DESCRIPTION: THE AVIONICS FUNCTIONAL CHIPS WITHIN THE LRM'S ARE MORE SENSITIVE TO HIGH OPERATING TEMPERATURES THAN OLDER ELECTRONICS AND REQUIRE MORE COOLING PER CUBIC INCH OF FUNCTIONAL CIRCUITS. MATERIALS AND MATERIALS COMBINATIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO OPTIMIZE THE LRM COLDPLATE.

A NEW \"TAILORED\" MATERIAL COMBINATION CAN IMPROVE ON ALL OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS AND CAN BE APPLIED TO THE LRM AT A REASONABLE COST. THE MAIN GOALS, HOWEVER, ARE THE LOWERING OF THE JUNCTION OPERATING TEMPERATURES AND THE MATCHING OF THE CTE TO CIRCUIT BOARD ASSEMBLIES. ADEQUATE RELIABILITY OF THE VHSIC TYPE LRM'S WILL REQUIRE BOTH A REDUCED THERMAL RESISTANCE WITHIN THE LRM AND A LOWER RACK COLDWALL TEMPERATURE THAN CAN BE PROVIDED BY EXISTING AIRCRAFT ECS'S .

HOWEVER, THIS KIND OF CONTROL IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR MANIPULATORS DRIVEN BY ELECTRIC MOTORS WITH GEARED TRANSMISSIONS, PRIMARILY DUE TO FRICTION IN THE DRIVE TRAIN. YET THESE TYPES OF MECHANICAL SYSTEMS ARE OFTEN THE MOST PRACTICAL FOR MANY APPLICATIONS. TWO PRIMARY TYPES OF CONTROL STRATEGIES HAVE BEEN USED TO DATE FOR FORCE CONTROL WITH THESE KINDS OF SYSTEMS. ONE USES THE FORCE ERROR TO ADJUST THE TORQUE OF THE DRIVE MOTOR. THE OTHER UTILIZES FORCE FEEDBACK TO COMMAND MOTOR POSITIONS, RELYING ON COMPLIANCE IN THE SYSTEM FOR TRANSLATING POSITION TO FORCE. THE FORMER APPROACH TYPICALLY RESULTS IN SLUGGISH, NOISY CONTROL AND THE LATTER APPROACH TYPICALLY EXHIBITS POOR BANDWIDTH. NEITHER APPROACH ADEQUATELY ADDRESSES MANIPULATORS WHICH ARE MODERATELY BACK-DRIVABLE. WE PROPOSE AN ADAPTIVE FORCE CONTROL SYSTEM BASED ON THE \"BACKPROPAGATED ADAPTIVE CRITIC\" ARCHITECTURE, WHICH UTILIZES PRINCIPLES FROM DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING AND NEURAL NETWORKS TO ACHIEVE REAL-TIME ADAPTATION. THIS APPROACH REQUIRES FEW ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT PLANT DYNAMICS, AND A WIDE VARIETY OF SENSOR INPUTS CAN EASILY BE INCORPORATED. FURTHERMORE, EFFECTS WHICH DEPEND ON PAST AS WELL AS CURRENT STATES, SUCH AS BACKLASH, CAN ALSO BE ACCOMMODATED. HIGHER PERFORMANCE FORCE CONTROL FOR COMMON ELECTRIC MANIPULATORS (AND HANDS/ GRIPPERS) CAN SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE THE USE OF THESE DEVICES IN AUTOMATION AND TELEOPERATION.

WELLBORE LOGGING, THE FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTERIZATION TECHNIQUE CURRENTLY IN USE, CAN IN THEORY PROVIDE SUFFICIENT DATA TO DETERMINE THE PRINCIPAL PARAMETERS NEEDED TO EVALUATE A RESERVOIR. IN APPLICATION, WELL LOGGING IS MOST SUCCESSFUL IN THE HOMOGENEOUS RESERVOIRS WHERE DEFINITIVE SIGNATURES ARE EMBEDDED WITHIN LOG SUITES THAT ALLOW POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION OF HYDROCARBON-BEARING ZONES IN A WELLBORE. IN HETEROGENEOUS RESERVOIRS, HYDROCARBON SIGNATURES IN LOG SUITES ARE DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY BECAUSE OF THE VARIABILITY OF THE SIGNAL RESPONSE IN COMPLEX LITHOLOGIES. THIS PROJECT'S PHASE I EFFORT INVESTIGATES THE UTILITY OF APPLYING NEURAL NETWORKS TO RECOGNIZE AND EXPLOIT SIGNATURES EMBEDDED IN A SUITE OF WELLBORE LOGS FOR WELLS INHETEROGENEOUS RESERVOIRS. ESSENTIALLY, THE NETWORKS ARE TRAINED TO PREDICT WHICH ZONES IN A WELL WILL BE PRODUCTIVE,TO ESTIMATE THE POTENTIAL PRODUCTIVITY OF THOSE ZONES, AND TO ESTIMATE KEY RESERVOIR PARAMETERS SUCH AS POROSITY AND PERMEABILITY. THE DATA USED FOR PHASE I ARE OBTAINED FROM THE COMPLEX SILURIAN INTERLAKE FORMATION OF THE WILLISTON BASIN IN NORTH DAKOTA AND CONSIST OF THE EXISTING CONVENTIONAL WELL LOGS AVAILABLE. KEY QUESTIONS BEING ANSWERED DURING PHASE I INCLUDE HOW ACCURATELY THE NETWORKS PREDICT THE PRESENCE OF HYDROCARBONS IN BORE HOLES, HOW MUCHWELLBORE INFORMATION IS REQUIRED FOR ACCURATE MODELS, AND HOW THE METHODOLOGY CAN BE EXTENDED TO PREDICT PARAMETERS SUCH AS POROSITY AND PERMEABILITY. ADDITIONALLY, PHASE I INCLUDES EXAMINATION OF HOW DATA FROM OTHER SOURCES, I.E., DRILL-STEM TESTS, CORE ANALYSIS, AND MUD LOGS, CAN BE INTEGRATED INTO THE PATTERN RECOGNITION METHODOLOGY, AND TO WHAT EXTENT SUCH DATA IMPROVE THE NETWORK'S ABILITY TO CHARACTERIZE HETEROGENEOUS RESERVOIRS. THE PRINCIPAL EFFORTIN PHASE I IS DIRECTED AT IDENTIFYING WHICH NEURAL NETWORKS ARE APPLICABLE TO THE PROBLEM, DEVELOPING A PROCESS BY WHICHTO TRAIN THESE NETWORKS, AND ULTIMATELY DEMONSTRATING THE VIABILITY OF UTILIZING A NEURAL NETWORK-BASED CONCEPT TO ENHANCE RESERVOIR CHARACTERIZATION.",

SIMULATION MODELING IS A USEFUL TOOL FOR PREDICTING HOW WELL WORKSTATIONS PERFORM TOGETHER TO ACHIEVEA FACILITY'S DEFINED REPROCESSING GOAL. HOWEVER, THE INCLUSION OF SPECIFIC FAILURE AND REPAIR INFORMATION IS VERYDIFFICULT WITH CURRENTLY AVAILABLE SIMULATION MODELS. THE INABILITY TO INCLUDE RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, AND MAINTAINABILITY (RAM) CONSIDERATIONS IN A SIMULATION MODEL MAKES THE RESULTS LESS ACCURATE AND POTENTIALLY MISLEADING. THIS PROJECT INVOLVES EXPANDING AN EXISTING SIMULATION PROGRAM SO THAT A DESIGN ENGINEER CAN EFFICIENTLY INCORPORATE RAM INFORMATION INTO A SIMULATION MODEL AND OBTAIN RAM INFORMATION USEFUL IN MAKING DESIGN DECISIONS. TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING SUCH SOFTWARE, THE FOLLOWING TECHNICAL APPROACH IS BEING FOLLOWED IN PHASE I OF THIS PROJECT: (1) COLLECT DATA ON THE DESIGN, OPERATION, AND MAINTENANCE OF A SELECTED REPROCESSING FACILITY; (2) DEVELOP AN EXAMPLE APPLICATION; (3) ANALYZE COMPONENT FAILURE AND REPAIR DATA; (4) SELECT EXISTING SIMULATION ANALYSIS SOFTWARE FOR A PERSONAL COMPUTER; (5) BUILD SIMULATION MODELS; (6) CALCULATE PRODUCTION AND RELIABILITY CHARACTERISTICS AND IDENTIFY IMPORTANT COMPONENTS; AND (7) DOCUMENT THE FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS ONTHE FEASIBILITY OF INCORPORATING RAM ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES INTO SIMULATION MODELING.

THESE DEVICES WERE HOMOSTRUCTURE DIFFUSED DIODE LASERS WHICH OPERATED CONTINUOUSLY ONLY AT CRYOGENIC TEMPERATURES. SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENTS IN LEAD-SALT DIODE LASER PERFORMANCE HAVE BEEN REALIZED IN THE LAST DECADE FOLLOWING THE INTRODUCTION OF MOLECULAR BEAM EPITAXY (MBE) TECHNOLOGY. THE ABILITY TO CONTROL PRECISELY THE EPITAXIAL GROWTH ENABLED THE DEVELOPMENT OF BURIED DOUBLE HETEROSTRUCTURE AND QUANTUM WELL LASERS WITH CONTINUOUS OPERATION ABOVE 200 K. FURTHER PROGRESS IN LEAD-SALT TECHNOLOGY REQUIRES BOTH OPTIMIZATION OF DEVICE PARAMETERS AND IMPROVEMENT IN DEVICE PROCESSING. WE PROPOSE TO CONDUCT A COMPREHENSIVE THEORETICAL ANALYSIS WHICH WILL ENABLE US TO PREDICT THE TEMPERATURE LIMITS OF CONTINUOUS WAVE OPERATION WHILE DETERMINING OPTIMAL LASER PARAMETERS SUCH AS DOPING PROFILES, CLADDING LAYER COMPOSITION AND THICKNESS AND ACTIVE LAYER THICKNESS AND SHAPE. THESE PARAMETERS WILL BE DETERMINED BY CONDUCTING OPTIMIZATION CALCULATIONS ON THE MINORITY CARRIERS LIFETIME, INFLUENCE ON THE FREE CARRIER ABSORPTION ON MINORITY CARRIERS INJECTION LEVEL AND THE INFLUENCE OF THE THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY ON LAYER THICKNESS AND DEVICE STRUCTURE. THE STATE-OF-THE-ART LEAD-SALT LASER TECHNOLOGY WILL BE ANALYZED IN ORDER TO RECOMMEND MATERIAL PROCESSING IMPROVEMENTS INTENDED TO REDUCE DISLOCATIONS WHICH ARE MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO NONRADIATIVE RECOMBINATIONS AND THEREFORE TO LOW DIFFERENTIAL QUANTUM EFFICIENCIES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF MID-IR DIODE LASERS CAPABLE OF OPERATION AT OR NEAR ROOM TEMPERATURE WILL LEAD TO MANY APPLICATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY PRECLUDED BY STRINGENT CRYOGENIC COOLING REQUIREMENTS.

THE POTENTIAL ADVANTAGES OF SUCH VEINS WOULD BE LONGER AND MORE CONVENIENT STORAGE PREGRAFT, AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED STRUCTURAL DAMAGE DURING PROCESSING WHICH, IT IS ANTICIPATED, WOULD RESULT IN REDUCED THROMBOEMBOLIC RISK POST GRAFT AND LONGER GRAFT LIFE SPANS. IN ADDITION, ADVANTAGE WILL BE TAKEN OF THE ABILITY OF THE PROCESSING METHOD TO MAINTAIN TRANSIENT PARTIAL ENDOTHELIAL CELL FUNCTION, BUT NOT VIABILITY. THIS SHOULD ALLOW ENDOTHELIAL CELLS TO COVER THE INTIMA FOR A LIMITED PERIOD THEREBY AVOIDING IMMEDIATE THROMBO-OCCLUSION, BUT THESE COMPROMISED CELLS WOULD ULTIMATELY BE REPLACED BY AUTOLOGOUS ENDOTHELIAL CELLS. LATER, PHASE II STUDIES WILL FOCUS ON ANIMAL IMPLANT MODELS, THE FEASIBILITY OF SCALE-UP, AND DESIGN OF A PROTOTYPE COMMERCIAL PROCESSING MACHINE.",

THIS ADAPTATION WILL ALSO BE USEFUL IN MANY LABORATORY PROCEDURES OTHER THAN PCR SUCH AS PIPETTING RADIOACTIVITY, ENZYMES AND NUCLEIC ACIDS; AVOIDING CONTAMINATION WITH THE SUBSTANCE BEING PIPETTED. IN PHASE I, MACCONNELL RESEARCH DEVISED A NEW CONCEPT FOR A CONTAMINATION-PREVENTING PIPET TIP THAT ALLOWS A NON-PERMEABLE BARRIER TO BE EVER PRESENT BETWEEN THE PIPETTOR AND SAMPLE FLUID. THIS PRODUCT CONCEPT WILL BE SUPERIOR IN BOTH PIPETTING PERFORMANCE AND ABILITY TO PREVENT CONTAMINATION WHEN COMPARED TO THE PERMEABLE BARRIER TIPS CURRENTLY BEING MARKETED. IN ADDITION, THE PRODUCT WILL BE LESS EXPENSIVE AND LESS WASTEFUL THAN THE POSITIVE DISPLACEMENT (DISPOSABLE PLUNGER) PIPETTING SYSTEMS CURRENTLY OFFERED. WE WILL DEVELOP THE NON-PERMEABLE BARRIER TIPS IN PHASE II, DURING WHICH EXTENSIVE EXPERIMENTATION WITH FLEXIBLE, THIN PLASTIC MOLDED BARRIERS WILL BE CARRIED OUT.

EACH LISTENS AT ALL 11 FREQUENCIES AND DETERMINES WHICH TRANSMITTER IT HEARS. THE DISTANCE BETWEEN SUBMARINE AND TRANSPONDERS IS UPDATED MORE THAN THAT BETWEEN TRANSPONDERS. THE ACCURACY IS 1 YARD, BUT MIGHT BE IMPROVED. THE WORK PLAN IS DESCRIBED IN RELATION TO THE COMONENTS OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM AND QUESTIONS WHICH REQUIRE RESOLUTION. IT INCLUDES BUILDING AN AIR SIMULATION USING MICROPHONES AND SPEAKERS TO CHECK THE LOGIC AND RELATED COMONENTS OF THE TRANSPONDERS.

        "abstract": "THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO BUILD AND TEST A POWERED INCUS REPLACEMENT PROSTHESIS (PIRP) FOR USE IN INDIVIDUALS WITH CONDUCTIVE AND SENSORINEURAL HEARING LOSSES. THIS DEVICE IS SURGICALLY IMPLANTED IN THE MIDDLE EAR REPLACING THE INCUS. THE PIRP CONSISTS OF THREE COMPONENTS. THEY INCLUDE; 1) A MALLEUS SENSOR, 2) A SIGNAL CONDITIONING AND POWER UNIT (SCPU), AND 3) A STAPES DRIVER. THE MALLEUS SENSOR IS ATTACHED TO THE HEAD OF THE MALLEUS BONE AND MEASURES THE STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS OF THE EARDRUM RESPONDING TO SOUND. OUTPUT FROM THE MALLEUS SENSOR IS AMPLIFIED BY THE SCPU AND VIBRATES THE STAPES DRIVER. A NON-RECHARGEABLE LITHIUM CELL SUPPLIES POWER TO ALL THREE COMPONENTS. THE PIRP WILL AMPLIFY SOUND PRESSURE AT THE EARDRUM. A MINIMUM 3 YEAR BATTERY LIFE IS EXPECTED. AN OUTPATIENT SURGICAL PROCEDURE CAN REPLACE THE LITHIUM CELL. SINCE THE PIRP IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE MIDDLE EAR, THE NATURAL DYNAMIC RANGE AND FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF A HEALTHY MIDDLE EAR MAY BE RESTORED. THIS DEVICE HAS GREAT COSMETIC APPEAL BECAUSE THERE IS NO EXTERNAL APPARATUS. A TEAM CONSISTING OF A TECHNICAL MANAGER, TRANSDUCER ENGINEER, TWO EAR SURGEONS AND A BIOMEDICAL ENGINEER, WILL COMBINE THEIR EXPERTISE TO 1) DETERMINE THE OPERATING PARAMETERS FOR THE PIRP, 2) FORMULATE A SUITABLE FINAL DESIGN FOR EACH COMPONENT, AND 3) FABRICATE AND TEST A PROTOTYPE UNIT. IN PHASE I RESEARCH, FRESH TEMPORAL BONES WERE USED TO HELP EVALUATE THE MALLEUS SENSOR, STAPES DRIVER AND SCPU. WE BELIEVE THE PIRP CAN BE A SIGNIFICANT ADVANCEMENT IN MIDDLE EAR REPLACEMENT DEVICES AND HEARING AID IMPLANTS. THE PIRP IS TOTALLY CONCEALED IN THE MIDDLE EAR AND REQUIRES NO DAILY MAINTENANCE. IT DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH NORMAL ACTIVITIES LIKE SHOWERING, SWIMMING OR SLEEPING. THE PIRP INDIRECTLY MEASURES THE SOUND PRESSURE IN THE EAR CANAL.",

THE ONLY COMMONLY USED TECHNIQUE FOR ASSESSING THIS PARAMETER, THE OSMOTIC FRAGILITY TEST, IS VERY TIME CONSUMING, GIVES AN END-POINT ANALYSIS AND REQUIRES CONSIDERABLE EXPERTISE TO AVOID MANY SOURCES OF ERROR (PH, DILUTIONS, OSMOLALITY, CONTROL CELLS). USING ANIMAL ERYTHROCYTES WE HAVE DEVELOPED A TECHNIQUE, MICROPHOTOHEMOLYSIS, WHICH IS RAPID AND EASY TO USE AND GIVES BOTH THE RATE AND MAGNITUDE OF HEMOLYSIS WITH VERY SMALL VARIANCES. LIGHT THROUGH A MICROSCOPE IS USED FOR ACTIVATION OF A FLUOROCHROME-ERYTHROCYTE MIXTURE AND THE RESULTING HEMOLYSIS IN THE FIELD OF VIEW IS QUANTITATED BY A DETERMINATION OF THE INTENSITY OF TRANSMITTED LIGHT PASSING THROUGH THE SAMPLE. IN PHASE I, OUR AIMS ARE TO DETERMINE IF THIS TECHNIQUE CAN BE USED TO DISTINGUISH 1) NORMAL HUMAN ERYTHROCYTES FROM THOSE OF PATIENTS WITH SICKLE CELL ANEMIA OR HEREDITARY SPHEROCYTOSIS, 2) NORMAL CELLS AND FROM THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN TREATED WITH DRUGS WHICH ALTER MEMBRANE FRAGILITY AND, 3) SUBPOPULATIONS OF SICKLE CELLS OR OF DRUG TREATED NORMAL CELLS WITHIN THE SAME SAMPLE.

THE RECENT INTRODUCTION OF A LOW COST PRESSURE SENSOR USING A FIERCE SENSITIVE RESISTOR (FSR), MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO DEVELOP A COST EFFECTIVE, REAL TIME MONITORING DEVICE FOR COMPOSITES DURING THE MANUFACTURING PHASE. THE PROPOSED CONCEPT IS BASED ONMONITORING THE PRESSURE AT SELECTED LOCATIONS WHERE IT IS INFLUENCED BY UNDESIRED ELEMENTS LIKE OVERBLEEDING, VOLATILE TRAPPING, ETC. MISSION RESEARCH CORPORATION (MRC) IS PROPOSING TO DEVELOP A REAL TIME SENSING SYSTEM FOR THE COMPOSITE MATERIAL PROPERTIES DURING CURE USING FSR. MRC WILL BE SUPPORTED BY DOUGLAS AIRCRAFT COMPANY (DAC), A COMPONENT OF THE MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORP. (MDC) DURING ITS EXPERIMENTAL PHASE. A LOW COST (ABOUT $20 A SENSOR) PRESSURE SENSOR USING FSR WILL BE USED AS A MEANS OF IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF COMPOSITE MATERIAL AND ASSURING DEFECT FREE PRODUCT. PRESSURE SENSORS WILL BE EMBEDDED INTO CURINGLAMINATES IN AN AUTOCLAVE AND THE EFFECT OF COMBINED CHANGES IN PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE WILL BE EXAMINED. THEORETICAL AS WELL AS EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS WILL BE MADE TO ESTABLISH THE FEASIBILITY OF THE CONCEPT. THE EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON THE IN-SITU SENSOR READING WILL BE ESTABLISHED. THE EFFECT OF PROCESSING DEFECTS THAT AFFECT THE MATERIAL PROPERTIES WILL BE EXAMINED. THIS WILL INCLUDE POROSITY, RESIN RICHNESS, WRONG TYPE OF RESIN SYSTEM, VARIATIONS IN CURE CYCLE, AND LOSS OF VACUUM.

ONE ARRAY IS USED PER FEED. THE APPROACH IS PRACTICAL BECAUSE ALL OF THEABOVE PARAMETERS HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED PREVIOUSLY IN RELATED CROSSED-FIELD DEVICES, AND THE PHASE-LOCKING SCHEME WAS RECENTLY DEMONSTRATED IN A SMALL, LOW POWER MAGNETRON ARRAY. THE COMBINING POWER FROM MULTIPLE TUBES APPEARS TO IMPROVE PHASE COHERENCE DRAMATICALLY AND MAY LEAD TO BENEFITS IN RELIABILITY AS WELL. IT APPEARS THAT BECAUSE OFTHEIR SMALL SIZE, THE USE OF SECONDARY-EMITTING CATHODES (COMMON IN HIGH POWER, CROSSED-FIELD TUBES), AND THE SHARING OF CERTAIN PARTS AND COMPONENTS BETWEEN TUBES, THE MAGNETRONS MAY ULTIMATELY COST WITHIN AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE OF MICROWAVE OVEN MAGNETRONS. THIS DEVELOPMENT, TOGETHER WITH MODULATOR COST SAVINGS CAUSED, FOR EXAMPLE, BY LOW OPERATING VOLTAGE AND HIGH TUBE EFFICIENCY, WOULD MAKE THIS APPROACH THE MOST COST-EFFECTIVE NLC RF SOURCE BY AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE.

THE REDUCTION OF RIBONUCLEOTIDES TO DEOXYRIBONUCLEOTIDES, CATALYZED BY RIBONUCLEOTIDE REDUCTASE, IS A CRUCIAL AND RATE LIMITING STEP IN THE PATHWAY LEADING TO DNA SYNTHESIS AND THEREFORE REPRESENTS A FAVORABLE BIOCHEMICAL SITE FOR INHIBITION OF DNA SYNTHESIS AND THEREFORE CELL PROLIFERATION. THIS LABORATORY HAS DEVELOPED A NEW SERIES OF RIBONUCLEOTIDE REDUCTASE INHIBITORS THAT ARE POTENT INHIBITORS OF THE ENZYME AND PRODUCE ANTITUMOR ACTIVITY IN ANIMAL TUMOR MODELS. ONE IS CURRENTLY IN CLINICAL TRIALS. A COMPOUND OF THIS SERIES MAY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE AN EFFECTIVE TOPICAL ANTIPSORIATIC AGENT. SUPPORT FOR THIS THESIS IS PROVIDED BY THE FACT THAT HYDROXYUREA, A WEAK RIBONUCLEOTIDE REDUCTASE INHIBITOR, IS PRESENTLY USED AS BOTH AN ANTICANCER AND AN ANTIPSORIATIC AGENT. THE POTENTIAL OF DIDOX, ONE OF THE BEST ANTICANCER COMPOUNDS IN THIS SERIES, TO AFFECT PSORIASIS WILL BE DETERMINED. THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY MEASURING ITS EFFECT ON EPIDERMAL DNA SYNTHESIS IN HAIRLESS MOUSE SKIN AND HUMAN SKIN/NUDE MOUSE MODELS. TO TEST THE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY POTENTIAL OF DIDOX THE MOUSE SKIN EAR INFLAMMATION MODEL WILL BE USED.

        "abstract": "THE PROPOSED PHASE I RESEARCH WILL EXAMINE TWO NOVEL PROCESSES FOR IMPROVING THE UNIFORMITY AND DENSITY OF CERAMIC MATRIX CHEMICAL VAPOR INFILTRATION (CVI). BOTH METHODS INVOLVE THE UNIFORM SELECTIVE DEPOSITION OF MATRIX MATERIAL STARTING AT THE FIBER MATRIX INTERFACE. ONE TECHNIQUE INVOLVES THE DEPOSITION OR ADDITION OF MATERIAL, ON THE FABRIC PREFORM, WHICH WILL SELECTIVELY COUPLE TO AN RF INDUCTION POWER SUPPLY. THIS SELECTIVE COUPLING SHOULD CAUSE LOCAL HEARING AND HENCE LOCAL DEPOSITION OF THE MATRIX MATERIAL. THE SECOND IMPROVED CVI PROCESS INVOLVES COATING OF MATERIALS, ON THE FABRIC PREFORM, WHICH WILL CATALYZE THE FORMATION OF THE MATRIX MATERIAL. THIS WILL ALLOW DEPOSITION OF THE MATRIX MATERIAL TO OCCUR AT LOWER TEMPERATURES AND THUS AVOID SOME OF THE UNDESIRABLE PREFERENTIAL SURFACE PORE CLOSURES WHICH INHIBIT COMPOSITE DENSIFICATION. THE PHASE I EFFORT WILLEVALUATE COMPOSITES FABRICATED BY BOTH OF THESE PROCESSES. EVALUATIONS WILL INCLUDE MICROSTRUCTURAL EXAMINATIONS AS WELL AS ROOM TEMPERATURE STRENGTH AND TOUGHNESS MEASUREMENTS OF COMPOSITES MADE WITH THE MOST PROMISING ADDITIVES. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - THE PROPOSED IMPROVED CVI PROCESSES SHOULD LOWER PROCESSING COSTS FOR CIV INFILTRATED COMPOSITES. THESE LOWER COSTS WOULD RESULT FROM FEWER STEPS IN THE CVI PROCESS AND FEWER POST CVI PROCESSING STEPS TO FORM NET SHAPE COMPOSITES. THESE POTENTIAL ADVANTAGES OF THESE CVI PROCESSES MAKE THEM POTENTIALLY ATTRACTIVE PROCESSES FOR CERAMIC MATRIX COMPOSITE COMPONENT PRODUCTION FOR ENGINE AND AIRFRAME COMPONENTS",

        "abstract": "ECM systems incorporating repeater, transponder and noise jamming techniques can produce a plethora of extraneous false targets which then give rise to bogus target track files. False target detections and subsequent false tracks can so overload a radar's processing hardware/software that the normal functioning of the system can be brought to a virtual standstill. The goal of this Phase I SBIR program is to develop and investigate novel ECCM techniques to detect and eliminate ECM noise, repeater and transponder signals from radar track files. To accomplish this goal, we have selected an approach which exploits the shortcomings of conventional techniques for ECM signal generation. In particular, a radar modulation technique is proposed which can conceptually defeat digital RF memory (DRFM) and nonlinear amplifier devices used in ECM systems.",

THIS PROPOSAL DESCRIBE THE DEVELOPMENT OF DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING (DSP) ALGORITHMS THAT WILL ENHANCE THE ECM RESISTANCE OF A TACTICAL GPS RECEIVER. AN INNOVATIVE \"SOFTWARE\" RECEIVER ARCHITECTURE IS DESCRIBED THAT WILL BE USED TO IMPLEMENT THESE ALGORITHMS IN PHASE II. THE SOFTWARE RECEIVER TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH-SPEED DSP MICROPROCESSORS WHICH ARE CAPABLE OF PERFORMING REAL-TIME CODE AND CARRIER TRACKING ON THE 20 MHZ SAMPLED P-CODE SIGNALS. THIS APPROACH WILL ALLOW MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY IN DEVELOPING A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT ECM RESISTANT RECEIVER UNDER PHASE II AS WELL AS PROVIDING A VIABLE RECEIVER DESIGN FOR FUTURE PRODUCTION. THE ECM RESISTANT RECEIVER WILL BE CAPABLE OF TRACKING HIGH-DYNAMIC PLATFORMS UNDER HIGH JAMMING CONDITIONS. THE RECEIVER WILL ALSO BE SUITABLE FOR INTEGRATION INTO A TRANSLATOR PROCESSING SYSTEM FOR TRACKING GPS TRANSLATOR ON REGISTRATION ROUNDS.",

SOPHISTICATED AVIONICS HAVE ALLOWED THE INDUSTRY, TO SOME EXTENT, TO ADAPT TO VISIBILITY-REDUCING WEATHER ELEMENTS. VARIOUS TECHNIQUES TO ELIMINATE THE VISIBILITY RESTRICTION DUE TO WARM FOG HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED, BUT NONE HAS PROVEN TECHNOLOGICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY VIABLE. RECENTLY, VERY SUCCESSFUL, EFFICIENT LASER DISSIPATION OF FOG IN A LABORATORY ENVIRONMENT WAS CARRIED OUT UNDER SDIO SPONSORSHIP. THE TECHNIQUE PRESENTS AN INNOVATIVE AND PRACTICAL APPROACH FOR ELIMINATING AIRPORT WARM FOG. A THOROUGH STUDY OF TRANSITIONING THE LABORATORY LASER DISSIPATION TECHNIQUE TO AIRFIELD APPLICATION WILL BE MADE IN PHASE I. WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE VARIOUS TYPES OF CLEARING LASERS AS WELL AS THE OPTIONS FOR ENERGY PRODUCTION TO PUMP THE LASERS. BOTH RADIATION AND ADVECTION FOGS WILL BE CONSIDERED USING SEVERAL DROP SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS FOR EACH TYPE. THE EFFECT OF THE LASER ENERGY WITHIN THE EFFECTED VOLUMES ON TEMPERATURE, RELATIVE HUMIDITY, TOTAL LIQUID WATER AND DROP SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS AS A FUNCTION OF TIME WILL BE INVESTIGATED. CONSIDERABLE DETAIL ON THE OPTICAL SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE SUCH AS BEAM CONTROL, LASER GAS HANDLING AND RELIABILITY THROUGH REDUNDANCY WILL BE ADDRESSED. AN ASSESSMENT WILL ALSO BE MADE OF THE POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND SAFETY ASPECTS. LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS STRONGLY INDICATE THAT AN EFFECTIVE, PRACTICAL LASER FOG CLEARING SYSTEM IS POSSIBLE.

A GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT PHARMACOLOGICAL BLOCKADE OF NON-NMDA GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS, PRINCIPALLY KAINATE AND AMPA RECEPTORS, COULD PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT THERAPEUTIC BENEFIT IN THE TREATMENT OF SEIZURE DISORDERS AND THE PREVENTION OF NEURONAL DAMAGE AND DEATH. NOVA HAS IDENTIFIED PROPRIETARY COMPOUNDS POSSESSING KAINATE/AMPA RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST PROPERTIES AND HAS A MEDICINAL CHEMISTRYEFFORT DEVOTED TO THE SYNTHESIS OF NEWER COMPOUNDS. THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THE PHASE I PROJECT IS TO FURTHER CHARACTERIZE THESE COMPOUNDS AND WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY COMBINING IN VITRO ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY APPROACHES WITH IN VIVO BEHAVIORAL STUDIES. THE PURPOSE OF THESE STUDIES IS TO ASSESS THE THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL OF NOVA'S KA/AMPA RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS AS ANTICONVULSANT AND CEREBROPROTECTIVE AGENTS.",

THE REMOTE OPTICAL DISPLACEMENT MEASUREMENT ALLOWS GREATER THERMAL ISOLATION THAN WITH EXISTING SENSORS. THE SENSOR DIRECTLY PRODUCES A 32-BIT OUTPUT WORD PROPORTIONAL TO DISPLACEMENT. THE NEW SEISMOMETER BEING DEVELOPED IN PHASE I IS COMPACT, ROBUST, AND INEXPENSIVE AND HAS LOW POWER CONSUMPTION.

A FEW INEXPENSIVE DIGITAL LOGIC AND MEMORY INTEGRATED CIRCUITS ARE TO BE CONFIGURED TO PROVIDE ALL THE REQUIREMENTS FOR SEISMIC MONITORING.

THE BASIC PRINCIPLE USED IS PHASE SENSITIVE OPTICAL RADAR: A LASER DIODE IS MODULATED AT 1000 MHZ AND LASER RADIATION REFLECTED FROM A TARGET OBJECT IS DETECTED. THE PHASE OF THE DETECTED MODULATION IS A LINEAR FUNCTION OF THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE SENSOR AND THE REFLECT ING TARGET-ONE CYCLE OF PHASE FOR EACH 5.9-INCHES OF SEPARATION. OPTRA HAS DEVELOPED A ROBUST TECHNIQUE (HARDWARE + FAST ALGORITHMS) FOR MAKING SUCH PHASE MEASUREMENTS WITH A RESOLUTION OF 1/3000-CYCLE, OR DISTANCE RESOLUTION OF 0.002-INCH.

IN COMPARISON WITH OTHER TYPES OF CLASSIFICATION AND DECISION ALGORITHMS, NEURAL NETWORKS ARE ROBUST AND DEPEND ONLY WEAKLY ON ASSUMPTIONS MADE ABOUT INFORMATION OR NOISE DISTRIBUTIONS. AS A RESULT, THERE IS LESS DIFFICULTY ADAPTING NEURAL NETWORK TECHNOLOGY TO A VARIETY OF INFORMATION SOURCES. IN ADDITION, THIS TYPE OF PROCESSING PROVIDES THE POTENTIAL FOR ADAPTABILITY IN THE FACE OF NEW OR CHANGING THREAT SIGNATURES. RECENT RESULTS IN NEURAL NETWORK RESEARCH HAVE SHOWN THE DESIRABILITY OF FUSING DATA FROM SUCH DIFFERENT SENSORS AS ACOUSTIC AND VISUAL INPUT TO PERFORM SPEECH RECOGNITION. THE ABILITY TO ENCODE FUZZY RELATIONS AND DECISION RULES IN NEURAL NETWORKS CAN OVERCOME THE SPEED LIMITATIONS OF SERIAL DECISION-MAKING AIDS SUCH AS RULE-BASED EXPERT SYSTEMS. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE PHASE I EFFORT IS TO CONVERT THE STATE-OF-THE-ART WORK THAT HAS BEEN COMPLETED IN NEURAL NETWORKS TO SOFTWARE, WHICH CAN BE USED FOR INFORMATION PROCESSING AND DECISION MAKING IN A COMMAND AND CONTROL OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, SUCH AS THE PLANNING AND EXECUTION OF AN AIRBORNE ASSAULT.

ONE GROUP WILL RECEIVE THE BASIC PROBLEM DEFINITION CAPABILITY OF THE SOFTWARE (TEXTUAL QUERIES AND COMPILATION OF PROBLEM CONSTRUCTS). A SECOND GROUP WILL RECEIVE BRAINSTORMING SUPPORT IN ADDITION TO THE PROBLEM DEFINITION SUPPORT. COGNITIVE MAPPING AND RELATED QUERIES (E.G., REPERTORY GRID)PLUS PROBLEM DEFINITION SUPPORT WILL BE PROVIDED TO THE THIRD GROUP. THE FOURTH GROUP WILL COMPLETE THE TASK WITH PENCIL AND PAPER. THE RESULTS WILL BE BASED ON A WEIGHTED EVALUATION OF THE NUMBER OF OPTIONS GENERATED BY EACH GROUP. PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THE VALUE OF SUCH SUPPORT DEPENDS ON ITS CONTENT AND FORMAT. THE RESULTS OF THIS RESEARCH WILL BE USEFUL TO PARADIGM DEVELOPMENT GROUP AND ALL OTHER RESEARCHERS IN DEVISING DECISION SUPPORT SOFTWARE.",

IS DEVELOPING A SOFTWARE PACKAGE FOR INDIVIDUAL DECISION SUPPORT THAT PROVIDES AN INTEGRATIVE GRAPHICAL MODEL, WHICH IS INITIALLY EXPANDED (PROBLEM STRUCTURING) AND THEN CONTRACTED (ANALYTICAL STRUCTURING) PRIOR TO ANALYSIS VIA QUANTITATIVE MODELS. THIS PROCESS CAN BE CHARACTERIZED AS HAVING THREE PHASES: DIVERGENCE, CONVERGENCE, AND ANALYSIS. THESE PHASES MAY BE REPEATED INTERATIVELY OR MAY BE STOPPED EARLY, DEPENDING ON THE NEEDS OF THE USER. THIS SOFTWARE USES GRAPHICAL MODELS TO MOVE THE USER THROUGH THE STRUCTURING AND ANALYSIS PHASES. PROBLEM STRUCTURING IS A COMBINATION OF TEXT-BASED QUERIES AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF A COGNITIVE MAP, A DIRECTED GRAPH. THE SOFTWARE WILL THEN AID THE USER IN REDUCING THE COGNITIVE MAP TO AN ANALYTICALLY TRACTABLE INFLUENCE DIAGRAMDURING THE ANALYTICAL STRUCTURING (CONVERGENCE) PHASE. ANALYTICAL SUPPORT FOR ELICITATION, SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS ANDINTERPRETATION WILL BE PROVIDED DURING THE LAST PHASE. THIS RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THE CONVERGENCE PHASE. THE DIVERGENCE AND ANALYTICAL PHASES ARE WELL UNDERSTOOD AND HAVE BEEN AUTOMATED. THE ABILITY TO DO THE CONVERGENCE PHASES ARE WELL UNDERSTOOD AND HAVE BEEN AUTOMATED.

THIS NEED IS PARTICULARLY ACUTE IN THE FABRICATION OF FUEL INJECTORS FOR GASOLINE AND DIESEL ENGINES. IN THOSE ENGINES, THE INJECTORS ARE USED TO BOTH METER AND ATOMIZE THE FUEL. FOR A GIVEN PRESSURE DROP, THE FLOW THROUGH THE INJECTOR ORIFICES VARIES INVERSELY WITH THEFOURTH POWER OF THE ORIFICE DIAMETER. THEREFORE, SMALL VARIATIONS IN HOLE DIAMETER RESULT IN LARGE VARIATIONS IN FLOW. EXISTING MICRODRILLING TECHNIQUES (EDM, LASER AND ELECTRON BEAM DRILLING, AND OTHERS) HAVE MARGINAL ACCURACY AND PRODUCE A ROUGH RECAST LAYER WHICH RESULTS IN BURRS AT THE INLET AN EXIT OF THE ORIFICES. POOR INJECTOR HOLE QUALITY LEADS TO VARIATIONS IN FUEL-TO-AIR RATIO RESULTING IN POOR ENGINE PERFORMANCE AND INCREASED POLLUTION. THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES AN IMPROVED MICRODRILLING PROCESS. THE PROPOSED PROCESS IS A DERIVATIVE OF ELECTROCHEMICAL MACHINING (ECM) AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE BURR-FREE HOLES WITH TIGHT DIMENSIONAL CONTROL AND LOW CYCLE TIMES.

TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS APPROACH, WE WILL CONDUCT A PHASE I PROGRAM INVOLVING BOTH HYPERVELOCITY TESTING AND ANALYSIS. OUR PHASE I TEAM INCLUDES WELL-KNOWN AND RECOGNIZED EXPERTS IN BOTH OF THESE AREAS. THIS INTRIGUING APPROACH USES A CERAMIC IN CONJUNCTION WITH METALLIC MATERIALS WHICH SERVE AS \"FRAGMENTORS\" TO DESTROY THE PROJECTILE AS IT IMPACTS THE SHIELD. THIS MATERIAL ACTS AS A DUAL MODE, DEBRIS-FRAGMENTING COMPOSITE TO DISINTEGRATE THE PARTICLE AND DISPERSE IT HARMLESSLY. INCLUDED IS THE POTENTIAL FOR ENHANCED STRUCTURAL SURVIVABILITY THROUGH THE USE OF CELLULAR CONSTRUCTION. A MAJOR BENEFIT IS THREAT ADAPTABILITY - THE ABILITY TO ACHIEVE VARIABLE PROTECTION LEVELS TO MEET AN EVOLVING THREAT. MOREOVER, THE MATERIALS CONCEPT IS APPLICABLE TO TRUE STANDOFF BUMPER SHIELDS OR APPLIQUES. THE ANALYSIS TASK INCLUDES MATERIAL PREDESIGN EFFORT (SHIELD MICROMECHANICAL DESIGN) AS WELL AS SHIELD CONFIGURATION DESIGN AND, IF APPROPRIATE, SIMULATION USING THE PC-BASED HYDROCODE ZEUS. EXPERIMENTAL EFFORT INCLUDES TWO HYPERVELOCITY TESTS TO PROVIDE TESTS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON CONCEPT FEASIBILITY. THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF THIS PROGRAM INCLUDE DEVELOPMENT OF AN APPROACH TO TAKE MAXIMUM ADVANTAGE OF THE CAPABILITIES OF CERAMICS AND THEIR COMPOSITES, WHILE MINIMIZING THEIR DISADVANTAGES. THESE MATERIALS POSSESS HIGHER MODULUS AND ARE MORE DENSE THAN ALUMINUM, AND BOTH OF THESE FACTORS ARE PARTICULARLY ADVANTAGEOUS IN THE HYPERVELOCITY ENVIRONMENT. MOREOVER, THEIR HIGH HARDNESS MAY ASSIST IN FRAGMENTING DEBRIS. A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM COULD RESULT IN CONSIDERABLY IMPROVED LEVELS OF PROTECTION FOR BOTH MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL SPACECRAFT.",

Airwake phenomena has been studied and analyzed using wind tunnel models and computer simulation but present day practice still requires ship-aircraft dynamic interface (Dl) tests. The technical objective of Phase I is to design a practical instrumentation system which will provide comprehensive quantitative and qualitative data for ship motion measurements and airwakes surveys used to complement Dl testing. Task 1 of the project will establish the system requirements through meetings and research. A survey of applicable motion, air flow, and ancillary sensors is performed in Task 2. Task 3 is a survey of data acquisition systems and supporting equipment. Task 4 develops a software specification and performs a survey of available software. The design developed in Task 5 culminates hardware and software specifications, design drawings, and test and operations plans to be used in the Phase II development and testing.",

THE PRIMARY TECHNICAL TASK OF THE DEVELOPMENT IS DESIGN OF A TRANSDUCER SYSTEM, INCLUDING FOCUSING ELEMENTS AND A ELETRONIC SUMMING NETWORK, WHICH WILL MIMIC THE DIRECTIONALITY AND RELATIVE SENSITIVITY OF THE HUMAN EARS SO THAT THE SOLDIER CAN LOCATE AN ULTRASONIC SOURCE AS IF HE WERE HEARING IT IN THE AUDIO ACOUSTIC RANGE.

THIS CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED USING A LASER SOURCE BECAUSE, UNLIKE IN THE CASE OF A FLASH X-RAY, BOTH THE PHOTON SOURCE AND THE CAMERA CAN BE LOCATED REMOTELY FROM THE WARHEAD AND THE LIGHT PULSES CONDUCTED TO AND FROM THE EXPLOSION SITE BY EXPENDABLE FIBER OPTICS OR MIRRORS WHICH CAN BE DESTROYED BY THE EXPLOSION.

IN ORDER TO DECIDE ON THE MOST EFFICIENT, SAFE, AND COST-EFFECTIVE PROGNOSIS, THE DEGREE OF SEVERITY OF A FAULT MUST BE DETERMINED. AT PRESENT, CONDITION ASSESSMENT TECHNIQUES ARE BEING EXPLORED WHICH REQUIRE A LARGE AMOUNT OF PROCESSING AND PRODUCE A LIMITED CATEGORIZATION OF THE DEGREE OF SEVERITY. THEY ARE ALSO LIMITED BY LOW SIGNAL TO NOISE LEVELS AT THE EARLY FAULT STAGE. A DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM FOR SUCH CONDITION ASSESSMENT IS PROPOSED USING A NEURAL NETWORK TO IMPROVE ON THE SPEED AND PRECISION OF DIAGNOSIS. PSI TECHNOLOGY COMPANY PROPOSES TO DEVELOP A TECHNIQUE FOR REAL-TIME, CONTINUOUS HEALTH MONITORING OF ROTATING MACHINERY USING NEURAL NETWORKS TO PROCESS RAW TIME TRACES.

THE FIBER OPTIC SENSOR WILL OPERATE ON THE PRINCIPLE OF MODAL POWER DISTRIBUTION (MPD) MODULATION IN MULTIMODE FIBERS CAUSED BY MECHANICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL DISTRUBANCES IN THE SMART MATERIALS. THE THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION WILL BE DIRECTED TOWARD THE THREE BASIC OBJECTIVES; ADDRESSING THE FUNDAMENTAL FIBEROPTIC SENSOR PERFORMANCE UTILIZING THE MODAL POWER DISTRIBUTION TECHNIQUE, THE PROCESSING-STRUCTURE-SENSOR INTERACTION, AND A COMPOSITE-SENSOR SYSTEM PERFORMANCE EVALUATION. THE STRATEGY FOR THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO USE THE MODAL POWER DISTRIBUTION IN OPTICAL FIBERS AS A HIGHLY SENSITIVE TOOL FOR MEASUREMENTS OF STRUTURAL RESPONSE OF VARIOUS MODES OF PERTURBATION. THIS TECHNIQUE WILL BE APPLIED FOR SENSING THESE PERTURBATIONS BY COMPARATIVE MEASUREMENTS OF MODAL POWER DISTRIBUTION AND SUBSEQUENT REDISTRIBUTION AT THE OUTPUT END OF THE FIBER. IN A PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION, CARRIED OUT IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS, RESULTS INDICATE THAT THIS DEVELOPED TECHNIQUE IS HIGHLY SENSITIVE, INEXPENSIE, AND WELL SUITED FOR SMART STRUCTURE APPLICATIONS. TO OPTIMIZE THE SENSOR CONFIGURATION, AN EXTENSIVE STUDY OF SENSITIVITY AND DYNAMIC RANGE OF THE SENSOR WILL BE INVESTIGATED.

THE SENSING ELEMENT IS A CROSSLINKED POLYMER THAT SWELLS WITH INCREASING HYDROGEN ION CONCENTRATION, CAUSING A REFLECTING SURFACE TO MOVE. THE SENSOR INCLUDES TWO OPTICAL FIBERS, ONE CONDUCTING LIGHT TO THE REFLECTOR AND THE OTHER COLLECTING REFLECTED LIGHT. AS THE REFLECTOR MOVES, THE FRACTION OF LIGHT COLLECTED BY THE SECOND FIBER CHANGES. THEREFORE, CHANGES IN PH CAN BE RELATED TO CHANGESIN INTENSITY VIA A CALIBRATION CURVE. THE SENSING CONCEPT CAN BE EXTENDED TO CO2 BY PLACING THE PH SENSOR IN CONTACT WITH A SOLUTION OF BICARBONATE AND COVERING THE LIQUID WITH A HYDROPHOBIC MEMBRANE PERMEABLE TO CO2. BECAUSE THE SENSING ELEMENT IS A CROSSLINKED POLYMER THAT DOES NOT NEED TO BE DIRECTLY PHOTOEXCITED, THE SENSORS ARE INTRINSICALLY RUGGED AND WILL HOLD CALIBRATION FOR EXTENDED PERIODS. THEYCAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE NEAR INFRARED AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF LOW COST COMPONENTS DEVELOPED FOR FIBER OPTIC COMMUNICATIONS. THE SENSOR DESIGN ALLOWS COMPLETE OPTICAL ISOLATION OF THE SAMPLE FROM THE OPTICAL MEASUREMENT. PHASE I RESEARCH OBJECTIVES ARE (1) TO PREPARE A FIBER OPTICSENSOR THAT RESPONDS TO PH OVER THE RANGE OF 7.5 TO 8.5 AND CAN RESOLVE PH DIFFERENCES OF 0.01, (2) TO EXPERIMENTALLY MEASURE THE DEPENDENCE OF SENSOR RESPONSE ON TEMPERATURE AND IONIC STRENGTH, (3) TO DEVELOP A HIGHLY ELASTIC POLYMER SENSING ELEMENT THAT DOES NOT SHOW ANY HYSTERESIS IN RESPONSE TO PH, AND (4) TO EVALUATE SENSOR STABILITY. PHASE II OBJECTIVES WILL BE (1) TO BUILD A PORTABLE INSTRUMENT FOR REMOTE, LONG TERM UNATTENDED PH MONITORING, (2) TO EVALUATE LONG TERM IN-SITU RESPONSE OF THE SENSOR SYSTEM FOR AT LEAST 6 MONTHS, AND (3) TO INCORPORATE THE PH SENSITIVE POLYMER INTO A SENSOR THAT RESPONDS TO CO2 PARTIAL PRESSURE.",

COLI AS A FUSION PROTEIN CONTAINING A SHORT HYDROPHILIC MARKER PEPTIDE SEQUENCE (FLAG PEPTIDE), FUSED TO ITS AMINO TERMINUS. THIS EIGHT AMINO ACID FLAG SEQUENCE, ASP- TYR-LYS-ASP-ASP-ASP-ASP-LYS, HAS BEEN SHOWN TO ALLOW FLAG-CONTAINING FUSION PROTEINS TO BE PURIFIED TO HOMOGENEITY ON AN AFFINITY COLUMN OF AN ANTI-FLAG MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY (MAB) UNDER EXTREMELY MILD CONDITIONS (PHOSPHATE BUFFERED SALINE, PH 7.2, + OR - CALCIUM). THIS UNIQUE AND MILD ONE-STEP PURIFICATION PROCEDURE YIELDS FLAG FUSION PROTEIN PRODUCTS OF HIGH PURITY AND ACTIVITY, BOTH OF WHICH ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR CRYSTALLIZATION. ONCE THE FLAG IL-3 FUSION PROTEIN HAS BEEN PURIFIED, CRYSTALLIZATION TRIALS WILL BE CARRIED OUT, BOTH ON THE FREE FLAG- IL-3 PRODUCT AND ALSO ON ITS COMPLEX WITH THE FAB FRAGMENT OF THE SAME ANTI-FLAG MAB. BECAUSE FAB FRAGMENTS AND FAB/ANTIGEN COMPLEXES ARE RELATIVELY EASY TO CRYSTALLIZE, IT IS LIKELY THAT FORMING THE COMPLEX WILL ALTER THE CRYSTALLIZABILITY OF THE FLAG-IL-3 MOLECULE. SUCCESSFUL CRYSTALLIZATION OF FLAG IL-3 WILL SERVE THE DUAL PURPOSES OF (L) PROVIDING THE STARTING MATERIAL FOR SOLVING THE THREE DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE OF IL-3 AND (2) TESTING THE UTILITY OF THE FLAG ANTIBODY MEDIATED CRYSTALLIZATION CONCEPT. THE CRYSTALS OBTAINED WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE A THREE DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE OF IL-3 IN PHASE II STUDY. THIS STRUCTURE, IN TURN, CAN BE USED TO CARRY OUT RATIONAL DRUG DESIGN PROCEDURES TO FIND NEW AND IMPROVED MIMICS OR ANTAGONISTS FOR IL-3, WHICH WILL BE OF CLINICAL AND COMMERCIAL VALUE IN THE TREATMENT OF DISEASES THAT ARE RELATED TO THE ROLE OF IL-3 IN EARLY HEMATOPOIESIS AND IMMUNITY.",

A MAIN OBJECTIVE IS TO DEVELOP A SINGLE SYSTEM THATCAN COUNTER THE ENTIRE RANGE OF POSSIBLE THREATS. IN PURSUIT OF THISGOAL, A TECHNICAL ADVANCEMENT TO FREE THE COUNTERMEASURE TECHNIQUE OF ITS LIMITATIONS IS SOUGHT. A DISTANCE-SELECTIVE OPTICAL HYDROPHONEIS PROPOSED TO MITIGATE THE LIMITATIONS OF THE COUNTERMEASURE SYSTEM. IT OPTICALLY MEASURES THE ACOUSTIC SIGNALS AT A FIXED DISTANCE FROMTHE HULL, SO THAT THERE IS SUFFICIENT TIME TO PROCESS THE INSONIFICATIONS SIGNALS BEFORE THE PROPAGATING ACOUSTIC WAVES REACH AND REFLECTFROM THE HULL. THE SENSOR IS A UNIQUE HETERODYNE LASER SENSOR THAT USES THE FOCAL CUSP OF A FOCUSED LASER BEAM TO PROVIDE THE DISTANCE SELECTIVITY. THE SUSPENDED PARTICULATES IN THE OCEAN, WHICH CAN BE ENHANCED, PROVIDE THE OPTICAL REFLECTORS THAT WILL MOVE WITH THE MOVEMENTOF THE MEDIUM RESULTING FROM INSONIFICATION.

ACCURATE DEPENDABILITY EVALUATIONS ARE A CONCERN OF BOTH MANUFACTURERS AND USERS OF SYSTEMS WHO OFTEN INVEST MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO KEEP SYSTEMS OPERATING CORRECTLY. A DEPENDABILITY TOOL THAT CAN ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS IS IN DEMAND IN BOTH THE COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY ENVIRONMENTS.

ALTHOUGH HEPARIN IS THE BEST DRUG FOR TREATMENT OF THROMBOEMBOLIC DISEASE, IT IS UNSTABLE IF ADMINISTERED ORALLY AND MUST THEREFORE BE ADMINISTERED BY THE INTRAVENOUS OR SUBCUTANEOUS ROUTE. IN ADDITION, THE THROMBOCYTOPENIA AND BOTH BLEEDING AND THROMBOSIS, WHICH CAN EMERGE AS COMPLICATIONS OF THIS THERAPY, REMAIN A CLINICAL PROBLEM. RECENTLY, IN A PRELIMINARY REPORT, A GROUP OF SULFONATED BISLACTOBIONIC ACID AMINES HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO POSSESS ANTICOAGULANT AND ANTIOCCLUSIVE PROPERTIES COMPARABLE TO THOSE CURRENTLY ATTAINABLE WITH COMMERCIAL HEPARIN. STARTING WITH COMPOUNDS SUCH AS MALTOSE AND CELLOBIOSE, THE DISACCHARIDE IS OXIDIZED AND CONDENSED WITH SHORT CHAIN DIAMINES AND THEN SULPHONATED. OUR FIRM PRODUCES LARGE QUANTITIES OF LACTOBIONIC ACID FOR STABILIZATION OF ERYTHROMYCIN AND ORGANS FOR TRANSPLANT. DURING A LITERATURE SEARCH, WE FOUND THAT SULPHONATED BIS-LACTOBIONIC ACID AMINES ARE POTENTIAL ANTICOAGULANTS. IN HEPARIN, THE 3-0'-SULPHATE ON THE MIDDLE SUGAR IS ESSENTIAL FOR ANTICOAGULANT ACTIVITY. WE WILL PRODUCE CARBOHYDRATES OF VARIOUS STRUCTURE WHICH MAY HAVE AN IMPROVED HEPARIN-LIKE ACTIVITY. THE COMPOUNDS WILL BE INITIALLY TESTED FOR ANTICOAGULANT PROPERTIES IN PHASE I AND, LATER IN PHASE II, THEIR ANTITHROMBOTIC ACTIVITY WILL BE EVALUATED. THE ADVANTAGE OF USING MALTOSE AS A BEGINNING DISACCHARIDE IS THAT IT MAY NOT BE DIGESTED TO THE SAME DEGREE AS OTHER SUGARS. CELLOBIOSE IS ANOTHER STARTING DISACCHARIDE WHICH MAY NOT BE CLEAVED BY MAMMALIAN DIGESTIVE ENZYMES. ALSO, THE COMPOUNDS ARE RATHER SMALL, SOLUBLE AND MAY BE READILY ABSORBED. THESE SMALL POLYMERS ARE ALSO NON-TOXIC. ANTICOAGULANT PROPERTIES OF THE FINAL COMPOUNDS GENERATED WILL BE EXAMINED FOR THEIR ABILITY TO PROLONG THE ACTIVATED PARTIAL THROMBOPLASTIN TIME AND THE THROMBIN TIME. THE STANDARD WILL BE HEPARIN, 175 UNITS/MG. DR.

THE FRACTIONAL CONTRIBUTION OF SULFUR OXIDE EMISSIONS FROM COAL IS GREATER THAN ITS FRACTION FROM OIL USED IN POWER GENERATION SINCE THE SULFUR CONTENT OF MOST OF THE COAL IS HIGHER. AMONG THE VARIOUS ALTERNATIVES THAT MAY BE USED TO REDUCE THE SULFUR OXIDE POLLUTION CAUSEDBY COAL-FIRED POWER GENERATION PLANTS, THE ADVANCED POWER GENERATION SYSTEMS BASED ON THE INTEGRATED COMBINED CYCLE GENERATORS AND THE MOLTEN CARBONATE FUEL CELLS APPEAR TO HAVE GREAT POTENTIAL. CURRENTLY THE MOST ADVANCED HOT GAS DESULFURIZATION PROCESS IS BASED ON THE ZINC FERRITE SORBENT. RECENT STUDIES WITH THE ZINC TITANATE SORBENT HAVEINDICATED THAT IT HAS A HIGHER OPERATING TEMPERATURE AND LIMITS THE SULFATE FORMATION. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE PERFORMANCE OF ZINC TITANATE SORBENTS CAN BE IMPROVED BY THE ADDITION OF SOME PROMOTERS TO (1) DECREASE THE EFFLUENT SULFUR LEVELS BELOW 1 PPM, (2) INCREASE ELEMENTAL SULFUR FORMATION DURING REGENERATION, (3) FACILITATE THE REMOVAL OF OTHER CONTAMINANTS SUCH AS ORGANIC SULFUR COMPOUNDS AND AMMONIA, AND (4) INCREASE THE SULFUR CAPTURE CAPACITY. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO STUDY IN DETAIL THE EFFECT OF PROMOTERS SUCH AS COBALT ON ZINC-TITANIUM OXIDE SORBENTS, NAMELY ON THEIR REACTIVITY, STABILITY, AND REGENERABILITY OVER THE TEMPERATURE RANGE OF 538-870 DEGREES CENTIGRADE. ANOTHER FACTOR THAT WILL BE INVESTIGATED IS THE ABILITY OF PROMOTERS TO ENHANCE ELEMENTAL SULFUR FORMATION DURING REGENERATION. THE RESULTSOF THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF ADVANCED POWER GENERATION SYSTEMS BASED ON THE INTEGRATED COMBINED CYCLE GENERATORS AND THE MOLTEN CARBONATE FUEL CELLS WHICH ARE SHOWN TO HAVE THERMAL EFFICIENCIES 15-30% HIGHER THAN THOSE OF CURRENT COAL-FIRED POWER GENERATORS.",

THE PROPOSED SBIR PHASE I RESEARCH WILL DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF ACHIEVING THE OPTICAL, MECHANICAL, AND ELECTRO-OPTIC STABILITY REQUIREMENTS OF A SOLAR VECTOR MAGNETOGRAPH TAKING LONG TIME EXPOSURES FROM A BALLOON PLATFORM UNDER SOLAR ILLUMINATION. THE PROPOSED BALLOON-BORNE, HIGH-RESOLUTION SOLAR VECTOR MAGNETOGRAPH WILL SUPPORT THE DEVELOMENT OF AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE FORMATION OF FLARES WITH EXPERIMENTAL DATA FAR SUPERIOR TO ANY AVAILABLE FROM GROUND-BASED OBSERVATORIES. THE UNDERSTANDING WILL BE ESSENTIAL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A FLARE PREDICTION CAPABILITY, WHICH IS NEEDED FOR THE PROTECTION OF SATELLITES, HUMANS IN SPACE, AND ELECTRICAL UTILITY DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS.",

A PERCEIVED NEED EXISTS FOR FLUE GAS DESULFURIZATION PROCESSES THAT PROVIDE MODERATE SULFUR DIOXIDE REMOVALS, HAVE LOW CAPITAL COSTS, AND ARE RETROFITTABLE. CURRENTLY, FURNACE SORBENT INJECTION TECHNOLOGIES SUFFER FROM THE MAJOR PRACTICAL DISADVANTAGE THAT A LARGE FRACTION OF THE REAGENT IS NOT USED. THE COST OF ACID GAS CONTROL BY SORBENT INJECTION PROCESSES IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE SORBENT UTILIZATION, WHICH DICTATES THE AMOUNT OF RAW MATERIAL TO BE BOUGHT AND HANDLEDAND THE AMOUNT OF WASTE MATERIAL REQUIRING DISPOSAL. SORBENT UTILIZATION DEPENDS UPON PARTICLE SIZE-THE SMALLER THE PARTICLE, THE HIGHER THE UTILIZATION.

THE RESULTS OBTAINED DURING THIS PROGRAM CAN SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE THE COST OF THE DETECTION SYSTEM ASSEMBLIES OVER THE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE ONES THAT USE EXPENSIVE MATERIALS SUCH AS ZNSE, ZNS, GE, GAAS. CONSIDERABLE COST ECONOMIES CAN BE OBTAINED BY COMBINING, FOR EXAMPLE, PLASTIC OPTICAL ELEMENTS WITH OTHER STRONGER MATERIAL.

TWO OF THE MOST PROMISING METHODS ARE BEING INVESTIGATED AND COMPARED IN THIS PHASE I EFFORT. THE FIRST METHOD USES TWO COMPLEX COMPOUNDS WITH SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT SORPTION ENERGIES AS LATENT PASSIVE STORAGE. THE SECOND METHOD FUNCTIONS AS A HEAT-ACTIVATED HEAT PUMP WITH CYCLE TIME DURATION BEING EQUAL TO THE STORAGE WINDOW, THUS PROVIDING LATENT HEAT STORAGE IN AN ACTIVE MODE.

AN ELECTRON CYCLOTRON RESONANCE ION SOURCE (ECRIS) PRODUCES IONS BY CREATING A PLASMA IN AN OPEN-ENDED MAGNETIC FIELD (A \"MAGNETIC MIRROR\") AND HEATING THE ELECTRONS WITH MICROWAVESAT THE ELECTRON CYCLOTRON FREQUENCY. THE HOT ELECTRONS IONIZE NEUTRAL ATOMS, AND THE RESULTING IONS FLOW OUT OF THEPLASMA ALONG THE MAGNETIC FIELD. A CONVENTIONAL ECRIS USES A NONAXISYMMETRIC MAGNETIC MIRROR TO AVOID MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC INSTABILITIES THAT WOULD DISRUPT THE PLASMA. HOWEVER, USING AN AXISYMMETRIC MAGNETIC FIELD ALLOWS HIGH FIELD STRENGTH, MAKING POSSIBLE HIGHER PLASMA DENSITIES AND TEMPERATURES, AND HENCE HIGHER ION CURRENT ANDCHARGE STATE. THIS INNOVATION USES AN AXISYMMETRIC MAGNETICFIELD STABILIZED WITH A POPULATION OF VERY HOT (RELATIVISTIC) ELECTRONS, A TECHNIQUE THAT HAS BEEN USED SUCCESSFULLY IN FUSION EXPERIMENTS. NORMALLY, THIS SCHEME WOULD REQUIRE A CERTAIN NNEUTRAL GAS PRESSURE IN ORDER TO PRODUCE THE WARM PLASMA REQUIRED FOR STABILITY OF THE HOT ELECTRONS, BUT THE NEUTRAL GAS WOULD PREVENT THE FORMATION OF HIGHLY CHARGED IONS. THIS PROBLEM IS BEING OVERCOME BY PRODUCING THE WARM PLASMA IN A REGION OF HIGHER NEUTRAL PRESSURE OUTSIDE THE MAGNETIC MIRROR AND ALLOWING IT TO FLOWIN. PHASE I OF THIS PROJECT INVOLVES STUDYING AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO HIGH FREQUENCY, HIGH FIELD ECRIS THAT SUBSTANTIALLY SIMPLIFIES THE MAGNETIC FIELD DESIGN REQUIREMENTS, ALLOWING HIGHER CURRENT AND ION CHARGE STATES THAN ARE OTHERWISE ACHIEBABLE.",

Combined power and attitude control modules have been proposed before for orbiting spacecraft with emphasis on high specific energies (kJ/lb). The application of this technology to missiles demands emphasis on achieving a high energy density (kJ/in3) in conjunction with a relatively high torquing capability. However, the power requirements are incompatible with the torque requirement if a simple motor/generator, reaction wheel approach is adopted. The proposal here outlines a program for attacking this challenging problem and presents a viable solution for achieving the desired goals. The component technologies for a successful design do exist. In fact SatCon Technology Corporation is fabricating a 65.4 kJ/Ib carbon fibre flywheel unit storing 8.0 NJ of energy and delivering attitud.e control torques for large spacecraft. Integrating these technologies into a volume constrained package requires an in depth knowledge of flywheel energy storage/retrieval, power conditioning and attitude control techniques. Phase I program will conduct a technology assessment, design a module and evaluate expected performance. Phase II program will build, test and deliver a prototype model.",

        "abstract": "Future Army rotorcraft/air-vehicle systems will require advances in survivability, operability and supportability. SatCon Technology Corporation proposes to design, fabricate, and demonstrate an integrated swashplate hydraulic actuation system for control of helicopter vibrations which will allow improvements in all three these areas. This system will improve operability by improving maneuverability, agility, and speed; improve supportability by increasing reliability; and improve survivability by decreasing noise signature. In conventional helicopters, control of the rotor is achieved by the use of a swashplate. For a number of rotor control problems, however, the existing hydraulically actuated swashplate is sub-optimal. Due to the limited frequency response of the swashplate's hydraulic actuators, existing swashplates have insufficient bandwidth to provide active control of higher harmonic helicopter rotor vibrations. However, the actuator bandwidth problem can be alleviated if the existing hydraulic actuators are replaced with a modern state-of-the-art hydraulic System. This approach requires a minimum modification of the existing hardware while achieving a significant reduction in the vibration of the fuselage. Phase I will consist of prove of concept, initial design, and detailed planning for phase II. Phase II will consist of design, fabrication, and testing of the prototype hardware.",

THIS HAS POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL VALUE BECAUSE OF THE MANY POSSIBLE USESOF HIGH-PRESSURE SEAWATER: IT CAN BE CIRCULATED IN ONSHORE AQUACULTURE TANKS, PASSED THROUGH A REVERSE OSMOSIS MEMBRANE TO PRODUCE FRESH WATER, OR PASSED THROUGH AN IMPULSE TURBINE TO GENERATE ELECTRIC POWER. THE ENTIRE PROJECT (PHASES I THROUGH III) IS FOCUSED ON THE SMALL-SCALE NEEDS OF RURAL AREAS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, WHERE EVEN THE PROVISION OF A FEW THOUSAND LITERS OF FRESH WATER PER DAY OR A FEW KILOWATTS OF POWER WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE BASIC LIVING CONDITIONS AND FACILITATE ECONOMIC GROWTH. FOR EXAMPLE, THE SHORESIDE PROVISION OF ICE (REQUIRING BOTH FRESH WATER AND ELECTRICITY) WOULD ENHANCE THE CASH-EARNING POWER OF LOCAL FISHERIES. IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS CONCEPT, FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH IS NEEDED ON THE HYDRODYNAMIC BEHAVIOR OF THE WAVE ENERGY ABSORBER, WHICH IS AN INCLINED CYLINDRICAL PIPE, ENTIRELY SUBMERGED BENEATH THE SEA SURFACE, WITH ONE END RESTING ON THE SEAFLOOR. THE PIPE WOULD BE ANCHORED IN RELATIVELY SHALLOW WATER AND WOULD BE HELD LEANING AT AN ANGLE INTO THE INCIDENT WAVES BY A FIBER-REINFORCED ELASTOMERIC HOSE, WHICH ACTS AS BOTH A COMPLIANT MOORING AND A SIMPLE ONE-WAY PUMP.",

BECAUSE OF THE BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF ENKEPHALINASE, THERE HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLE EFFORT IN DESIGNING POTENT INHIBITORS OF THE ENZYME. WE WILL USE A NOVEL STRATEGY FOR THE SUICIDE INHIBITION (MECHANISM-BASED INACTIVATION) OF ENKEPHALINASE USING SPECIFICALLY TARGETED PEPTIDOMIMETICS AND PEPTIDES BASED ON TWO DESIGN PRINCIPLES: 1) INCORPORATING STRUCTURAL MOTIFS WHICH INTERACT WITH THE ENZYME'S S1' AND S2' SUBSITES USING INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM ENKEPHALINASE SUBSTRATE SPECIFICITY AND COMPETITIVE INHIBITION STUDIES, AND 2) INTRODUCING LATENT FUNCTIONAL GROUPS, DETERMINED FROM OUR INVESTIGATIONS OF CARBOXYPEPTIDASE A, IN THESE MOLECULES WHICH, UPON MASKING, WILL INACTIVATE THE ENZYME. THE SUCCESS OF THIS APPROACH WILL LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW ANTINOCICEPTIVE AND ANTIHYPERTENSIVE THERAPEUTIC AGENTS.

THE DETECTIVITY OF THE ALXGA1-XAS/GAAS SUPERLATTICE DETECTORS IS ESTIMATED D*8.3UM=10E10/CM(HZ)1/2/W, COMPARABLE TO TYPICAL BACKGROUND-LIMITED HGCDTE PHOTOCONDUCTIVE DETECTORS. WE WILL ANALYZE THEORETICALLY THE DESIGN AND THE PERFORMANCE OF SUCH TRANSISTOR CONFIGURATIONS. THE APPROACH PROPOSED FOR FABRICATION OF THE SUPERLATTICE PHOTO-TRANSISTOR USES THE COMMERCIAL AVAILABLE MBE MATERIAL AND SIMPLE LASER INTERFERENCE PATTERNING. IF THE CONCEPT IS DEMONSTRATED, THE PRODUCTION CAN BE DONE READILY.",

WITH THE CURRENT INTEREST IN LIGHTSATS FOR VARIOUS APPLICATIONS, A LOW MASS ARRAY SYSTEM IS DESIRABLE FOR SMALL POWER REQUIREMENTS. AT PRESENT, HIGH-EFFICIENCY SOLAR CELLS ARE TOO COSTLY FOR MANY MISSIONS. THE LIGHTWEIGHT ARRAY DESIGNS HAVE CONSISTED OF \"FLEXIBLE\" SUBSTRATES IN EITHER ROLLED (FRUSA AND HUBBLE ST), AND FLATPACK FOLD-OUT (SAFE AND APSA) CONFIGURATIONS. THE PRIMARY LIMITATIONS OF THESE DESIGNS FOR LOW-POWER APPLICATIONS IS THAT A LARGE STORAGE HOUSING AND DEPLOYMENT MECHANISM ARE REQUIRED. THESE LIMITATIONS MEAN THAT THESE ARRAY ARE ONLY LIGHTWEIGHT FOR HIGH POWER APPLICATIONS, >5KW. FOR SMALLER ARRAYS, THE LOWER MASS OF THE SUBSTRATE IS OVERWHELMED BY THE MECHANICAL HARDWARE'S MASS, WHICH IS GENERALLY NOT AS SCALABLE TO POWER AS THE BLANKET AREA. ALSO, BECAUSE OF STIFFENING RODS USED FOR LATERAL SUPPORT, QUICK RETRACTION IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE, WHICH COULD HAVE SURVIVABILITY IMPLICATIONS. A MORE TRADITIONAL RIGID ARRAY IS FOLDED AND SELF-SUPPORTING FOR STORAGE, EASILY UNFOLDED, AND QUICKLY RETRACTED IF NECESSARY. UNFORTUNATELY, THE PANELS USED IN THESE DESIGNS HAVE SUBSTANTIAL MASS. A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THESE CONCEPTS, A SEMI-FLEXIBLE SOLAR ARRAY, WOULD PROVIDE A LIGHTER ARRAY FOR SMALLER SPACECRAFT. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS EFFORT WILL SUPPORT NUMEROUS GOVERNMENT LIGHTSAT PROGRAMS, INCLUDING BRILLIANT PEBBLES, TACSAT, AND NASA'S EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEM (EOS).

THIS MATERIAL IS AN EXCELLENT CANDIDATE FOR FABRICATING VACUUM ULTRAVIOLET (VUV) AND SOFT X-RAY DETECTORS THAT (1) ARE INSENSITIVE TO UNDESIRABLE WAVELENGTHS (INCLUDING HARD X-RAY) AND (2) HAVE MINIMAL RESPONSE TO HIGH ENERGY PARTICLES SUCH AS ELECTRONS AND PROTONS. ONE ADVANTAGE OF FABRICATING DETECTORS ON SOI SUBSTRATES IS THAT THIS METHOD OFFERS THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE THE THICKNESS OF THE SILICON TOP LAYER, THEREBY CREATING DETECTORS SELECTIVELY SENSITIVE TO SPECIFIED ENERGY RANGES. DETECTORS SENSITIVE TO A CHOSEN ENERGY RANGE DO NOT REQUIRE A SPECTROMETER.

WIRES WITH DIMENSIONS AS SMALL AS 10 NM PER SIDE AND A 200 NM PERIOD MAY BE ACHIEVED OVER LARGE AREAS USING THE HIGH RESOLUTION LATERAL DEFINITION OF X-RAY NANOLITHOGRAPHY AND THE PREFERENTIAL GROWTH OF MOCVD ON PATTERNED SUBSTRATES. WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE POTENTIAL OF THIS APPROACH FOR THE FABRICATION OF QUANTUM WIRE LASER ARRAYS WITH LOWER THRESHOLD CURRENTS, HIGHER POWER OUTPUT, BETTER EFFICIENCY, AND NARROWER LINE WIDTHS. PHASE II WILL DEAL WITH OPTIMIZATION OF THE PATTERNING/OVERGROWTH PARAMETERS FOR BETTER QUANTUM CONFINEMENT, BANDGAP ENERGY ENGINEERING, HIGHER PACKING DENSITY, AND BETTER PERFORMANCE OF THESE QUANTUM WIRE LASER ARRAYS.",

THIS PROJECT WILL INVESTIGATE AND DEFINE MODELING TECHNIQUESTO SIMULATE THE THERMO-MECHANICAL, TRANSIENT CHARACTERISTICSOF TURBOPUMP, BEARING SYSTEMS OPERATING IN CRYOGENICS. THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING AND INSTALLING THE SIMULATION ON APERSONAL WORKSTATION WILL BE INVESTIGATED. THE SOFTWARE PACKAGE WILL BE DESIGNED TO AUGMENT CURRENT MODELS OF TURBOPUMP, SHAFT-BEARING SYSTEMS. GIVEN THE INITIAL CONDITIONS, A DESCRIPTION OF THE SPEED TRANSIENT (INCLUDING LOADS AND COOLANT FLOW), AND THE GEOMETRICAL CHARACTERISTICS, THE MODEL WILL PREDICT THE TRANSIENT COMPONENT TEMPERATURES AND OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS OPERATING CLEARANCES, CONTACT ANGLES, STRESSES, AND LOAD DISTRIBUTIONS.

        "abstract": "To test an aircraft in its operational environment, minimal changes must be made to either the aircraft or its environment. Areas in which such non-intrusive testing methods are needed include the study of the ship/rotorcraft aerodynamic interface, remote site flight testing, and gathering simulation validation data from routine flight tests. To meet these needs, a portable instrumentation package (PINS) will be designed in the Phase I effort. Specific technical objectives of the program are: to develop system requirements based on the data accuracy, resolution, and sampling rates needed far flying qualities and performance testing, to develop and evaluate options for access to the signals required from existing production and non-production sensors, and to perform an initial design study of the portable instrumentation system. The specific innovation in the PINS design lies in the use of inertial navigation system (INS) data, in the design of an easily installable air data system, and in the use of a specialized microprocessor controller which will control the entire data recording process. The microprocessor will further allow for other features such as on-line health monitoring, automatic data quality checking and a simplified user interface.",

HENCE, IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO LAYUP A COMPONENT FROM PULTRUDED STOCK MATERIALS ONTO A MANDREL WHICH WOULD FIT INSIDE ANOTHER METAL SHELL. THE KEY WILL BE TO MAKE THE INNER AND OUTER MANDRELS OUT OF MATERIALS HAVING DIFFERENT COEFFICIENTS OF THERMAL EXPANSION. BY HAVING AN INNER MANDREL THAT CAN EXPAND MORE THAN THE EXTERNAL SHELL, VIRTUALLY ANY PRESSURE COULD BE EXERTED ON THE COMPOSITE SANDWICHED IN BETWEEN IN AN INEXPENSIVE OVEN. THE GOAL OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL BE TO UTILIZE THE UNIQUE REFORMING PROPERTIES OF THERMOPLASTIC COMPOSITES TO ALLOW SIMPLE FABRICATION OF HIGH-MODULUS HIGH-STRENGTH TUBULAR COMPOSITE COMPONENTS VIA THIS NOVEL DIFFERENTIAL THERMAL EXPANSION (DTE) PROCESS.",

IN REAL-LIFE SITUATIONS, MOVEMENT REQUIRES THAT THE WALKING MOTION ADAPT TO CHANGES EXTERNALLY IN THE LOAD OR INTERNALLY IN THE MUSCLE FORCE, NECESSITATING A REAL-TIME FEEDBACK OF POSITION INFORMATION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DESIGN A LOW-COST, ACCURATE TRANSDUCER MECHANISM FOR SENSING OF LOWER LIMB POSITION, NOT ONLY AT THE KNEE BUT ALSO AT THE OTHER CRITICAL AREAS SUCH AS THE HIP, ANKLE AND FOOT, HENCE POSSIBLY ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR ANKLE BRACES. A MECHANICAL MODEL OF LIMB MOVEMENT HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTED TO HELP IN THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE POSITION SENSING SYSTEM, AND THREE STRATEGIES WILL BE TESTED TO DETERMINE WHICH MOST ADEQUATELY MONITORS LIMB MOVEMENT SIMULTANEOUSLY AT SEVERAL POINTS ON THE BODY SURFACE. A GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO MOUNT SENSORS FOR LIMB POSITION IN A COSMETICALLY-PLEASING MANNER, SUCH THAT THEY WILL NOT BE VISIBLE TO A CASUAL OBSERVER. THE DEVICE WILL OUTPUT POSITION (OR JOINT ANGLE), VELOCITY AND ACCELERATION INFORMATION TO BE UTILIZED BY THE FUNCTIONAL NEUROMUSCULAR STIMULATION HARDWARE FOR REAL-TIME ADAPTATION OF MOVEMENT TO CHANGES IN EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL CONDITIONS.",

BOTH LAMPS PROVIDE STABLE SOURCES OF UV/VUV RADIATION, AND CAN BE CALIBRATED BOTH IN RADIANCE AND IRRADIANCE. HOWEVER, EACH HAS DISADVANTAGES THAT LIMIT ITS USEFULNESS AS A BENCHTOP OR SPACE-QUALIFIED STANDARD. ONE POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE SECONDARY RADIOMETRIC STANDARD FOR THE UV/VUV IS THE RF-EXCITED ELECTRODELESS DISCHARGE LAMP. THESE LAMPS ARE SMALL, HAVE LOW INPUT POWER REQUIREMENTS, HAVE A LONG LIFETIME, AND HAVE BEEN ADAPTED FOR SPACEFLIGHT. BY VARYING THE RARE GAS FILL PRESSURE (FROM A FEW TORR TO TENS OF TORR) EITHER CONTINUUM RADIATION OR SPECTRALLY PURE LINE RADIATION CAN BE GENERATED IN THE UV AND VUV. PRELIMINARY MEASUREMENTS ON A KRYPTON VUV CONTINUUM LAMP INDICATE THAT THE LAMPS ARE LONG-LIVED AND STABLE ENOUGH TO BE CONSIDERED AS POSSIBLE RADIOMETRIC STANDARDS. THE OBJECTIVE FOR THE PHASE 1 EFFORT IS THE EVALUATION OF A FEW RF-EXCITED LAMPS IN TERMS OF THEIR SUITABILITY AS SECONDARY UV/VUV RADIOMETRIC STANDARDS. BY CHARACTERIZING A FEW KEY SOURCE PARAMETERS, ONE CAN DETERMINE WHETHER FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF THESE SOURCES IS WARRANTED.",

THIS APPARATUS WILL CONSIST OF A BRUXISM SENSOR AND RADIO TRANSMITTER THAT CAN BE INTEGRATED INTO ANY CUSTOM DENTAL ACRYLIC SPLINT. WHEN A BRUXING EVENT IS DETECTED, A RADIO SIGNAL PROPORTIONAL TO BRUXING FORCE TRIGGERS A NIGHTSTAND ALARM. THE NIGHTSTAND UNIT WILL BE PROGRAMMABLE TO IGNORE A PERCENTAGE OF BRUXING EVENTS, THUS IMPLEMENTING THE SELECTABLE REINFORCEMENT SCHEDULE THOUGHT NECESSARY BY LEARNING THEORISTS. IN ADDITION, IT WILL RECORD TIMES AND FREQUENCIES OF SUCH EVENTS ALLOWING THE PATIENT TO MONITOR PROGRESS AND THE CLINICIAN TO KEEP STATISTICS. THE GOALS OF PHASE I ARE TO INTEGRATE A BRUXISM SENSOR AND TELEMETRY UNIT INTO A COMFORTABLE SPLINT, TO DEVELOP A RECEIVER/ALARM UNIT, AND TO CARRY OUT A PILOT STUDY ON EFFICACY. THESE EFFORTS WILL FORM THE BASIS FOR A PHASE II COLLABORATION WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH DENTAL SCHOOL TO REFINE THE DEVICE, IMPLEMENT CLINICAL TRIALS AND FDA QUALIFY A COMMERCIAL INSTRUMENT.

THUS, IT IS THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT TO DEVELOP ACT-BASED SIGNAL PROCESSING ARCHITECTURES FOR NEAR-FAR-RESISTANT DEMODULATION OF DS/SSMA SIGNALS. THIS GENERAL OBJECTIVE CAN BE BROKEN DOWN INTO SEVERAL INTERMEDIATE AND SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES FOR PHASE I, INCLUDING THE DERIVATION OF IMPLEMENTABLE FORMS OF NEAR-FAR RESISTANCE ALGORITHMS; THE DEVELOPMENT OF ACT SIGNAL-MICROPROCESSOR-BASED SIGNAL PROCESSING ARCHITECTURES TO IMPLEMENT THESE ALGORITHMS; THE ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPROVEMENT IN BIT-ERROR RATES THAT CAN BE ACHIEVED BY THESE NEW ARCHITECTURES; AND THE ASSESSMENT OF THE RANGES OF FORMAT PARAMETERS FOR WHICH THESE ARCHITECTURES ARE PRACTICAL. THE RESULTS OF THIS PHASE I EFFORT WILL LEAD DIRECTLY TO A PHASE II EFFORT IN WHICH THE MOST PROMISING NEAR-FAR-RESISTANT SIGNAL PROCESSING ARCHITECTURES IDENTIFIED IN PHASE I WILL BE DEVELOPED",

IN PARTICULAR, ADVANTAGE WILL BE TAKE OF PLANNED JAMMER CANCELLATION CAPABILITIES IN THE FORM OF AN ADAPTIVE SIDELOBE CANCELLATION (ASLC) SYSTEM. THE APPROACH DEALS WITH THE JAMMER/CLUTTER INTERATION PROBLEM BY CANCELLING BOTH JAMMING AND CLUTTER SIGNALS AT A COMMON ANCELLATION NODE. A KEY FEATURE OF THE APPROACH IS CONSTRIANING THE SPACE/TIME PROCESS BY PREFILTERING THE INPUTS, FROM THE MAIN AND AUXILIARY CHANNELS, TO THE WEIGHT GENERATIONPROCESS, SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCING CLUTTER CANCELLATION PERFORMANCE WHILE SUPPRESSING INTERATCTIONS WITH MAINLOBE CLUTTER. ANOTHER FEATURE OF THE PROJECT IS THE USE OF A TIME-SAMPLE COMPUTER MODEL, IMPLEMENTED ON A HIGH SPEED ARRAY PROCESSOR IN A SUN WORKSTATION ENVIRONMENT, WHICH WILL CLOSELY REPRESENT REAL HARDWARE.

PRIOR TO THE EXPLOITATION OF THIS MATERIAL, ITS TRANSPORT (I.E., HERMETIC) PROPERTIES MUST BE QUANTIFIED TO ENABLE ITS TARGETING FOR SPECIFIC ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS. THE PROGRAM RESULT WILL BE THE NECESSARY PROCESS-MICROSTRUCTURE-TRANSPORT PROPERTY UNDERSTANDING TO DIRECT THIS MATERIAL TO SPECIFIC ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS. AN EXISTING VACUUM SYSTEM WILL BE MODIFIED FOR PERMEATION STUDIES. ALUMINASILICATE FILMS OF VARIOUS THICKNESSES WILL BE CAST BY VARIOUS TECHNIQUES, THERMALLY TREATED, AND DIFFUSION PROPERTIES MEASURED.

CURRENTLY, THERE ARE NO CLOSED FORM MATHEMATICAL MODELS FOR HGCDTE WAFER GROWTH USING MOCVD. MOCVD GROWTH OF HGCDTE INVOLVES NON-LINEAR RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN REACTOR CONTROL PARAMETERS AND MATERIAL GROWTH OUTPUT PARAMETERS (VIA OPTICAL SENSORS). THIS IS PARTLY DUE TO THE FACT THAT CHANGES IN MERCURY GAS FLOW RATES HAVE NON-LINEAR EFFECTS ON REACTION RATES. IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL IF A CONTROLLER COULD LEARN THE NON-LINEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CONTROL PARAMETERS AND OUTPUT SENSORS FROM THE GROWTH PROCESS. NEURAL NETWORK LEARNING MODELS OFFER THE TECHNOLOGY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONTROLLERS BY INTERACTIVELY OBSERVING THE BEHAVIOR OF THE GROWTH PROCESS AND BUILDING AN INTERNAL MODEL OF MOCVD WAFER FABRICATION. THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURE FOR IN-SITU CONTROL OF THE METAL-ORGANIC CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION (MOCVD) PROCESS FOR WAFER GROWTH.

ONE). A SIMPLE MODIFICATION TO THE OUTPUT STRUCTURE WILL ALLOW A SINGLE CCD DESIGN TO SERVE MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS BY OPERATING IN DIFFERENT READOUT MODES CONTROLLED BY INPUTS TO THE CCD. DURING PHASE I WE WILL REFINE THE CONCEPT. WE WILL ANALYZE RELEVANT TECHNOLOGIES FOR PERFORMANCE, MANUFACTURABILITY, AND COST. OUR PHASE I EFFORT WILL INCLUDE THE DESIGN, MODELING, AND FABRICATION OF A SMALL CCD CHIP TO PROVE THE FEASIBILITY OF OUR DEVELOPMENT. OUR APPROACH WILL UTILIZE FABRICATION BY EITHER LORAL (FORD) AEROSPACE OR ORBIT SEMICONDUCTOR. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS - A HIGH-DENSITY CCD CHIP THAT CAN AT ONCE SERVE REAL-TIME APPLICATIONS AND SINGLE-OUTPUT-TAP APPLICATIONS WOULD INCUR ONLY A SINGLE NRE CHARGE AND RIDE ON THE PRODUCTION VOLUMES OF BOTH.

WE PROPOSE TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOP ADVANCGD NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURES SUITABLE FOR INTEGRATION WITH IR SENSORS, EITHER AT THE FOCAL PLANE ITSELF OR TIGHTLY COUPLED TO EXISTING IMAGERS, TO PROVIDE THE HIGHBANDWIDTH SIGNAL PROCESSING REQUIRED TO MEET THESE SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS. PHASE I WILL INCLUDE THE DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF PROTOTYPE CUSTOM INTEGRATED CIRCUITS TO IMPLEMENT A NETWORK TO PERFORM AN AUTOMATIC GAIN CONTROL (AGC) TASK.OUR APPROACH WILL BE TO UTILIZE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE CMOS/BULK INTEGRATED CIRCUIT TECHNOLOGY TO IMPLEMENT THE NEURAL NETWORK, IN CONJUNCTION WITH AN EXISTING IR FOCAL PLANE ARRAY SENSOR. THE NETWORK WILL ACCEPT ANALOG INPUTS FROM THE SENSOR ARRAY, AND PRODUCE OUTPUT SIGNALS OF RELATIVELY CONSTANT DYNAMIC RANGE. THE SELECTION OF TECHNOLOGY IS INTENDED TO PERMIT ECONOMICAL AND RELIABLE FABRICATION OF THE NEURAL NETWORK, BY A NUMBER OF VENDORS. WE HAVE ALREADY DEMONSTRATED THE USE OF SUCH TECHNOLOGIES TO FABRICATE CONTINUOUS-TIME ANALOG NEURAL NETWORKS INTEGRATED WITH VISIBLE-LIGHT PHOTOSENSORS TO EXTRACT MOTION INFORMATION FROM A VISUAL SCENE.

THIS PROJECT USES AJET VAPOR DEPOSITION (JVD) TECHNIQUE TO DEPOSIT THE COMPONENT LAYERS OF THESE CELLS IN THIN FILM FORM. THESE COMPONENTS INCLUDE A SOLID ELECTROLYTE LAYER AS WELL AS POROUS ELECTRODE LAYERS. JVD HAS A PROVEN CAPABILITY TO DEPOSIT HIGH QUALITY, DEFECT-FREE CERAMIC, METALLIC, AND POLYMER THIN FILMS. THE INEXPENSIVE JVD TECHNIQUE MAKES USEOF SUPERSONIC GAS JETS OPERATING IN SIMPLE, LOW VACUUM, MECHANICALLY PUMPED FLOW SYSTEMS TO DIRECT A COLLIMATED STREAM OF VAPOR AT A SURFACE. IT IS A RAPID, VERSATILE, AND GENERAL TECHNIQUE THAT HAS BEEN USED FOR DEPOSITION OF SINGLE AND MULTICOMPONENT FILMS OF METALS, SEMICONDUCTORS, OXIDES, NITRIDES, AND ORGANICS. BY MECHANICALLY SCANNING ONE OR MORE JETS OVER A RAPIDLY MOVING SUBSTRATE, FILMS EXHIBITING UNIFORM PROPERTIES OVER HUNDREDS OF SQUARE CENTIMETERS HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED. THESE CAPABILITIES ARE VERY USEFUL FOR DEPOSITION OF MULTILAYER THIN FILM FUEL CELLSTRUCTURES COMPOSED OF SEVERAL KINDS OF MATERIALS. IN PHASEI OF THIS PROJECT, A SERIES OF SOLID, THIN FILM ELECTROLYTES AND ELECTRODES FOR FUEL CELLS IS BEING DEPOSITED AND THEIR ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCE TOGETHER IS BEING EVALUATED. REDUCTION IN SOLID ELECTROLYTE THICKNESS BY MEANS OF THIS DEPOSITION TECHNIQUE IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN IMPROVED CELL EFFICIENCY AND PERFORMANCE.",
