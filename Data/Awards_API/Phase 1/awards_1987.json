THIS SOLUBLE FACTOR EXERTS ITS BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS BY INTERACTING WITH SPECIFIC HIGH-AFFINITY RECEPTORS ON THE SURFACE OF ACTIVATED T CELLS.A DECREASE IN THE ABILITY TO PRODUCE IL-2 AND DYSFUNCTION OFINTERLEUKIN-2 RECEPTORS (IL-2RS) HAVE BEEN FOUND IN SEVERAL DISEASES, INCLUDING AUTOIMMUNITY, GRAFT VERSUS HOST REJECTION, ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY, LYMPHOADENOPATHY, ANDCANCER. THUS A STRONG RATIONALE EXISTS FOR THE INVESTIGATION OF IL-2 AND IL-2R. PHASE I OF THIS STUDY WILL DEVELOP A SENSITIVE ELISA ASSAY FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF IL-2 AND IL-2R IN THE SAME SAMPLE OF CULTURED LYMPHOCYTES; DETERMINE THE OPTIMAL CONDITIONS FOR THE ASSAY; AND DETERMINE THE SENSITIVITY OF THE ASSAY BY COMPARISON WITH A BIOASSAY. PHASE II WILL INVOLVE THE MEASUREMENT OF IL-2 AND IL-2R IN NORMAL SUBJECTS AND IN PATIENTS WITH CANCER, AIDS, ARTHRITIS, SLE, AND PEMPHIGUS, AS WELL AS IN TRANSPLANTATION SUBJECTS AND OTHERS. WHEN SUFFICIENT CLINICAL DATA HAVE BEEN ACCUMULATED, THE ASSAY WILL BE CONVERTED INTO KIT FORM FOR RESEARCH AND CLINICAL USE.",

DURING PHASE I OF THE PROGRAM, A HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY INSTRUMENT (HDI) WILL BE IMPROVED BY ADDING A SPATIAL LIGHT MODULAR (SLM). THIS WILL PERMIT IMPROVED PICTURE QUALITY AND FASTER WRITING. USING A DATA BASE CORRESPONDING TO A SIMPLE 3-D SURFACE, THECOMPUTER-DRIVEN HDI WILL BE USED TO CREATE HARD COPY 3-D IMAGES OF THE SURFACE. THIS EFFORT WILL DEFINE THOSE PARAMETERS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO BRIGHT, LOW NOISE HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGES. THE SLM SHOULD PRODUCE DISPLAYS WITH RESOLUTIONS OF 10 MILLION VOXELS OR MORE. IN PHASES II AND III, THE 3-D DISPLAYS AT THIS RESOLUTION WILL BE PRODUCED IN COLOR. THE INTERFACE BETWEEN EMISSION-COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY SYSTEMS AND THE HDI WILL BE DEVELOPED AS WILL THE CRITICAL INTERFACE WITH THE USER.",

SUCH A SOURCE WOULD BE SOLID STATE BUT THE OVERALL SYSTEM WILL MOSTLIKELY NOT BE SO COMPACT IF THE WIDEBAND FREQUENCY TUNABILITY IS DESIRED. THE CONCEPTUAL SOLID-STATE (IN-AS) GYROTRON IS WIDE-BAND BUT OPERATED WITH A CRYOGENIC SYSTEM WHICH IS MOSTLIKELY BULKY. THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES CURRENT AVAILABILITY OF A NOVEL MM-WAVE SOURCE WHICH SATISFIES ALL THOSE FEATURES REQUIRED. THE NEW CONCEPT SOURCE IS CALLED ORBITRON MASER. UNLIKE TO CLASSICAL MASERS, IT OPERATES WITHOUT A CRYOGENIC SYSTEM AND, IF THE PROPOSAL IS SUCCESSFUL, WITH ONLY A SMALL POWER SUPPLY OR BATTERY. OUTPUT POWER AND WAVELENGTH REQUIREMENTS 0.1 MW AND 0.7MM ARE NO PROBLEM; THE ORBITRON HAS READILY PRODUCED UP TO 50W OVER THE REGION 0.3MM. THE OSCILLATOR IS AS SMALL AS A BEER CAN AND RUGGED CONSTRUCTION. DESPITE THE COMPLICATED PHYSICS TAKING PLACE FOR THE RADIATION EMISSION, THE CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION ARE EXTREMELY SIMPLE; THERE NEED NO LASER BEAMS (NEEDED FOR LASER BACKWARD WAVE OSCILLATOR), NO EXTERNAL ELECTRON BEAM AND/OR MAGNETS (NEEDED FOR GYROTRONS AND FREE-ELECTRON LASERS AS WELL AS MOST OF CLASSICAL SOURCES). THIS PROPOSAL EVALUATES THE ORBITRON MASER SOURCE IN COMPARISON WITH OTHER POTENTIAL CANDIDATES: FROM MAGNETRON TO ADVANCED CONCEPT SOURCES. THIS PROPOSAL THEN CONCENTRATE THE PHASE I EFFORT ONTO THE CHARACTERIZATION AND PERFORMANCE TEST OF THE ORBITRON SOURCE THROUGH INSTRUMENTATION OF A RADAR SYSTEM. THE PROPOSAL STUDIES THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING A COMPACT MILLIMETERWAVE RADAR (HERE CALLED MIDAR) EMPLOYING THE NOVEL OSCILLATION SOURCE.

PLATINUM COMPLEXES HAVING KNOWN ANTITUMOR ACTIVITY WILL BE CHEMICALLY REACTED WITH SUBSTITUTED TETRAPHENYLPORPHYRIN COMPOUNDS. THE REACTION CONDITIONS WILL ASSURE STABLE BINDING OF THE ACTIVE PT MOIETY TO THE SUBSTITUENT SITES ON THE PORPHYRIN RING RATHER THAN AT THE CENTRAL SITE. IN THISWAY, THE PORPHYRIN THAT ACCUMULATES IN TUMOR TISSUE CAN ACT AS A CARRIER TO THE TUMOR FOR THE ACTIVE PT SPECIES.

BOTH NEEDLES ARE REMOVED AT THE END OF EACH TREATMENT. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO FURTHER DEVELOP AN INDWELLING FISTULA ACCESS DEVICE (IFAD) THAT CAN BE INSERTEDINTO A FISTULA OR GRAFT, LEFT IN PLACE FOR SEVERAL WEEKS OR MONTHS, AND USED FOR NUMEROUS HEMODIALYSIS TREATMENTS.

THE SMALL NEEDLE IS INSERTED FIRST INTO THE FISTULA OR GRAFT, AND ROTATION BRINGS THIS NEEDLE THROUGH THE SKIN, WHERE A CAP IS PLACED TO CLOSE IT AND TO STABILIZE THE DEVICE.

EXISTING PRODUCTS CANNOT ADEQUATELY IDENTIFY THESE ORGANISMS. BIOLOG, INC. HOLDS TWO PATENTS ON A NEW REDOX METHOD OF TESTING THAT CAN BE DEVELOPED INTO IDENTIFICATION TESTS FOR ALL CLINICALLY IMPORTANT MICROORGANISMS. THESE TESTS WILL IDENTIFY AN ORGANISM BASED ON PATTERNS OF CARBON SOURCE UTILIZATION. THE METHOD EMPLOYS A TETRAZOLIUM DYE TO COLORIMETRICALLY INDICATE CARBON SOURCE OXIDATION. THIS PHASE I STUDY WILL DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING A RAPID AND ACCURATE SPECIATION KIT FOR GRAM-POSITIVE BACTERIA. TWO TASKS ARE INVOLVED: (1) THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SUSPENSION MEDIUM COMPATIBLE WITH THE REDOX CHEMISTRY THAT IS TAILORED TO THIS GROUP OF ORGANISMS, AND (2) A SURVEY OF APPROXIMATELY 200 ORGANIC CHEMICALS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT NEW AND USEFUL SPECIATION TESTS CAN BE FOUND.

THE BURIED COAL TAR IS OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERN AS IT CAN MIGRATE AS A LIQUID PHASE, SLOWLY RELEASING THE TOXIC HYDROCARBONS TO SOIL AND GROUND WATER. RESEARCH BY CAA HAS SHOWN THAT THE 2- AND 3-RING PAH COMPONENTS OF COAL TAR ARE READILY DEGRADED IN TAR/SOIL MIXTURES, INDICATING THAT LAND TREATMENT MAY BE SUITABLE AS AN INNOVATIVE TREATMENT FOR COAL TAR. CAMBIDGE ANALYTICAL ASSOCIATES, INC. PROPOSES TO CARRY OUT LABORATORY SOIL MICROCOSM EXPERIMENTS TO DEMONSTRATE THE BIODEGRADATION OF THE 4- AND 5-RING PAH.

        "abstract": "RADIOIMMUNOASSAYS (RIAS) REPRESENT THE STANDARD METHODOLOGY FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF PARATHYROID HORMONE (PTH). HOWEVER, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF LIMITATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEASUREMENT OF PTH BY THIS TECHNIQUE. MOST IMMUNOASSYS ARE INSENSITIVE AND, THEREFORE, CANNOT DETECT CIRCULATING LEVELSOF HORMONE IN NORMAL SUBJECTS. CONSEQUENTLY, RIAS CANNOT DISTINGUISH NORMAL FROM HYPOPARATHYROID LEVELS OF PTH. MOSTRIAS ARE HETEROLOGOUS SYSTEMS THAT OFTEN UTILIZE BOVINE PTH AS THE RADIOLIGAND AND ANTISERA RAISED AGAINST BOVINE PTH TO MEASURE HUMAN PTH. A MAJOR FACTOR COMPLICATING PTH-RIA TECHNIQUES IS THE PRESENCE OF MULTIPLE FORMS OF CIRCULATING HORMONE. A PREPONDERANCE OF MIDREGION/CARBOXY-TERMINAL HORMONE FRAGMENTS EXIST IN THE CIRCULATION, BUT THESE FORMS OF THE PEPTIDE ARE WITHOUT BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY AND HAVE PROLONGED HALF-LIVES COMPARED TO BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE INTACT PTH (1-84). THE HETEROGENEITY OF THE HORMONE CONTRIBUTES TO THEHIGH NOISE-TO-SIGNAL RATIO ENCOUNTERED IN MOST PTH-RIAS. THE CYTOCHEMICAL BIOASSAY (CBA) FOR PTH CIRCUMVENTS THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH RIA AND REPRESENTS THE MOST SENSITIVE METHOD CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR MEASURING THIS HORMONE, BUT THIS ASSAY HAS NOT GAINED WIDESPREAD USE BECAUSE IT IS LABOR INTENSIVE, HAS LIMITED SAMPLE THROUGHPUT, AND REQUIRES EXPENSIVE INSTRUMENTATION.

IN OUR WORK, TOUGHNESS VALUES IN EXCESS OF 16 MPA.M(1/2) AS MEASURED BY THE DOUBLE CANTILEVER BEAM (DCB) TECHNIQUE WERE RECORDED. SUCH HIGH VALUES OF TOUGHNESS MAKE THESE MATERIALS IDEALLY SUITED FOR ADVANCED APPLICATIONS SUCH AS THE ADIABATIC DIESEL ENGINE. THE PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVES OF THE PHASE I EFFORT INCLUDE FABRICATION OF THESE CERAMIC MATERIALS OF CERAMATEC PROPRIETARY COMPOSITIONS AND EVALUATION OF STRENGTH AND TOUGHNESS AS A FUNCTION OF TEMPERATURE UP TO 1100 DEG C. HIGH TEMPERATURE TESTING WILL BE CONDUCTED IN COLLABORATION WITH THE ARMY MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY LABORATORY. THE RESULTS OF THE HIGH TEMPERATURE TESTING WILL BE USED IN AN ITERATIVE FASHION TO MAKE APPROPRIATE COMPOSITION AND PROCESS MODIFICATIONS TO YIELD MATERIALS WITH EXCELLENT STRENGTH AND TOUGHNESS RETENTION TO ELEVATED TEMPERATURES.",

DIGITAL FEATURE ANALYSIS DATA (DFAD) COULD IMPROVE FLIR SYSTEM CAPABILITIES BY PROVIDING CULTURAL FEATURE LOCATION AND IDENTIFICATION. IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE UTILITY OF DMA MAP INTEGRATION INTO FLIR SYSTEMS FOR THESE FUNCTIONS THE DEGRESS OF CORRELATION ACHIEVABLE BETWEEN MAP DATA AND SENSED IMAGE MUST BE DETERMINED. DCS PROPOSES TO PERFORM AN ASSESSMENT OF AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION INSTRUMENTS, SENSOR PLATFORM ANGLES/RATES, SENSOR RESOLUTION, AND MAP DATA BASE PARAMETERS AS THEY APPLY TO REAL-TIME MAP DATA ENHANCEMENT OF FLIR SYSTEM DISPLAYS. OTHER ISSUES SUCH AS MASS DATA STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL, THREE DIMENSIONAL IMAGE SOFTWARE CONTROL, AND VIDEO DISPLAY TECHNOLOGY WILL BE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE THE CORRELATION ACHIEVABLE BETWEEN THE MAP DATA AND THE SENSED IMAGE TO PREDICT THE SUCCESS OF THIS APPROACH.",

UPON DEPLOYMENT AND ACTIVATION BY A SALT WATER SWITCH AND ELECTRONIC TIMER, AN INITIAL EXPANSION OF THE NESTED CYLINDERS TAKES PLACE TO COMPENSATE FOR THE PAYLOAD WEIGHT. FROM THEN ON A MICROPROCESSOR AND PRESSURE-SENSOR-CONTROLLED STEPPING MOTOR IS USED TO MICRO ADJUST CYLINDER EXPANSION TO CAUSE THE DEVICE TO CHANGE BUOYANCY, THUS MAINTAINING DEPTH AT THE PRESET LEVEL. THE BUOYANCY DEVICE USES LITTLE ELECTRIC POWER, CONTAINS NO HAZARDOUS DEVICES AND HAS A VERY LOW PROJECTED UNIT COST. IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT DSI OFFERS A COMPLETELY FUNCTIONAL UNIT AS A PHASE I DELIVERABLE. IN PHASE II PRODUCTION PROTOTYPES AND UNITS FOR NAVY TESTING AND INITIAL DEPLOYMENT ARE OFFERED.",

THE PROBLEM WITH PRESENT SENSORS OF CONFIGURATION CATALYTIC METAL/SIO2/SI IS THEIR LACK OF SPECIFICITY AND LONG TERM INSTABILITY. WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE NEW STRUCTURES WHERE AN INSERTION COMPOUND IS INTERPOSED BETWEEN THE METAL AND THE SIO2. THE INSERTION COMPOUND IS CHOSEN TO BE SELECTIVE OF MOLECULE OR ATOM SIZE OR STRUCTURE. THE INSERTION LAYERS OF INTEREST ALSO UNDERGO A CHANGE IN ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY ON INSERTION OF THE SPECIES TO BE SENSED OR ITS BIPRODUCT INTO ITS CRYSTALLINE LATTICE. THESE REACTIONS ARE HIGHLY REVERSIBLE. THE RESULT IS A CHANGE IN THE CAPACITANCE OF THE METAL-INSULATOR-SEMICONDUCTOR STRUCTURE, WHICH IS ULTIMATELY REALIZED AS A CHANGE IN SOURCE-DRAIN CURRENT IN A FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTOR. IN PHASE I, IT IS PROPOSED TO SURVEY A VARIETY OF CATALYTIC METAL/INSERTION COMPOUND BILAYERS IN SIMPLE MIS DIODE STRUCTURES FOR CHEMICAL SENSITIVITY WITH IMPROVED SELECTIVITY, REVERSIBILITY AND STABILITY COMPARED TO PRESENT TECHNOLOGY.

AS A HEAT RECOVERY SOIL INCINERATOR, IT HAS THE ADVANTAGES OF REDUCED FUEL DEMAND AND LOW COMBUSTION GAS PRODUCT (REDUCING AIR POLLUTION CONTROL NEEDS FOR THE INCINERATOR). THE CCSSHT UNIT IS A SINGLE VESSEL ROTATING KILN THAT (1) PREHEATS ORE, (2) RETORTS THE ORE, (3) GENERATES PROCESS HEAT FROM THE COKE COMBUSTION, (4) CLEANS THE COKE FROM THE SAND, (5) RECOVERS THE HEAT FROM THE CLEAN SAND, AND (6) COOLS THE OIL VAPOR TO AVOID OIL COKING. THESE SIX FUNCTIONS, ALL REGULATED BY THE KILN AND STREAM FLOWRATES, PROVIDE A SIMPLE, EFFICIENT, AND LOW COST PROCESS. BESIDES PRODUCING CLEAN COOL ASH, THE SYSTEM IS ALSO ECOLOGICALLY ATTRACTIVE FOR USE WITH CARBONATE ORES BECAUSE IT GENERATES LESS ALKALINE ASH THAN OTHER PROCESSES--THE WESTERN U.S. OILSHALES CONTAIN NEARLY HALF CARBONATE MINERALS. BASED ON ROTARY FLUIDIZATION, THE CCSSHT RETORT IS EXPECTED TO OPERATE NEARLY AS EFFECTIVELY AS GAS FLUIDIZATION. OIL RECOVERY IS EXPECTED TO EXCEED THAT OF ASH RECYCLING SYSTEMSBY MORE THAN 20%. IT ENABLES HIGH EFFICIENCY HEAT RECOVERY FROM ASH IN A NEW APPROACH THAT AVOIDS THE NEED OF CAPITAL INTENSIVE BOILERS AND POWER GENERATORS.

THIS PROPOSAL IS DIRECTED TOWARD THE EVALUATION OF THE FEASIBILITY OF UTILIZING MULTIPLE-VARIABLE NDE METHODS TO PROVIDE FAST, COST-EFFECTIVE, RELIABLE DETERMINATION OF THE STRENGTH OF ADHESIVE BONDS THROUGH THE USE OF THE IMPACT SONIC WAVE SPECTRAL ANALYSIS METHOD. THE POTENTIAL FOR APPLYING THIS METHOD IS EVIDENCED BY ITS PREVIOUS SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION TO EVALUATION OF WOOD AND WOOD PRODUCTS. VARIATIONS IN MATERIAL TYPE, BONDED AREA, QUALITY, AGING, STRESS HISTORY, DENSITY AND CURING WILL BE EVALUATED BY SONIC WAVE NDE METHODS, COMBINED WITH DESTRUCTIVE TESTING. A MODEL WILL BE DEVELOPED AND VERIFIED WHICH CAN PREDICT BOND STRENGTH WITHIN A TARGET OF + 15 PERCENT.",

COST HAS BEEN A MAJOR OBSTACLE TO EXPANDING THE USE OF GAC TREATMENT AND ADSORPTION SYSTEMS WHICH MUST BE OPTIMIZED IF THEY ARE TO PROVIDE COST EFFECTIVE MUNICIPAL WATER TREATMENT. ONE OF THE PROCESS COST FACTORS HAVING THE GREATEST POTENTIAL FOR SAVINGS IS THE LOSS OF GRANULAR ACTIVATED CARBON.

AS POINTED OUT BY OTHERS, THIS CAN BE REDUCED BY OPTIMIZING THE ADSORPTION STEP AND REDUCING THE FREQUENCY OF REGENERATION. HOWEVER, A GREATER POTENTIAL FOR SAVINGS APPEARS IN A REDUCTION IN CARBON LOSSES: (1) DURING THE THERMAL REGENERATION PROCESS (2) CREATED DURING THE SLURRY TRANSPORT OF GAC FROM THE ADSORBER TO THE REGENERATION FURNACE AND RETURN. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE GREATEST REDUCTION IN THE COST OF GAC TREATMENT EMPHASIS MUST BE PLACEDON THEOSE COMPONENTS OFTHE TREATMENT PROCESS THAT (1) ARE COMMON TO ALL GAC SYSTEM DESIGNS, (2) CONSTITUTE THE GREATEST PORTION OF THE COST, AND (3) CANNOT BE EASILY CHANGED ONCE THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN BUILT.

HOWEVER, RECENT ADVANCES IN COMPUTER CONTROL AND DATA PROCESSING TECHNIQUES ARE RAPIDLY CHANGING THE VERY NATURE OF MICROSCOPIC ANALYSES. TODAY, COMPUTER CONTROLLED SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY (CCSEM) AND AUTOMATIC IMAGE ANALYSIS PERMIT QUANTIFICATION OF ATMOSPHERIC AEROSOLS AND SUBTLE DIFFERENCES IN THE SIZE, SHAPE, AND COMPOSITION OF ATMOSPHERIC AEROSOLS. COUPLING THIS RAPIDLY EMERGING TECHNOLOGY WITH CLUSTER ANALYSIS, A MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUE FOR IDENTIFYING COMMONALITY IN OBJECTS OR GROUPS OF OBJECTS, AND FRACTAL ANALYSIS, A MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUE WHICH PERMITS DETAILED QUANTIFICATION OF SURFACE TEXTURE COMPARABLE TO THE DETAIL PERCEIVED BY THE HUMAN EYE, SHOULD PERMIT QUANTIFICATION OF PARTICULATE MATTER IN A MANNER NEVER BEFORE PERFORMED. THIS PROPOSED PROJECT INTENDS TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF USING A NOVEL COMBINATION OF CCSEM, CLUSTER ANALYSIS AND FRACTAL ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES TO CHARACTERIZE ATMOSPHERIC AEROSOLS.",

THIS WILL IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY AND THE SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF THE NUMERICAL PROCEDURES SUBSTANTIALLY. NEXT, THREE-DIMENSIONAL CALCULATIONS BY TRACING \"VORTEX FILAMENTS\" WILL BE PERFORMED.

IN THE REGENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL KIDNEY APPLICATION, A CARBON BED WITH ABOUT 250 GRAMS OF ACTIVATED CARBON IS USED TO ADSORB THE STRONGLY ADSORBABLE SPECIES THAT ACCUMULATE BETWEEN DIALYSIS SESSIONS. THE SPECIFIC AIM OF PHASE I IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF RELIABLE MODIFICATION OF A CARBON BED. THE MODEL SPECIES TO BE INVESTIGATED WILL BE CREATININE, URIC ACID AND VITAMIN B12, AND UREA. WITH THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THESE MODIFICATION METHODS, GINER, INC. WILL PREPARE A PRELIMINARY CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF A REGENERATION SYSTEM AND A PROCEDURE FOR TWO APPLICATIONS: (1) CARBON BEDS USED TO ADSORB URIC ACID, CREATININE MIDDLE MOLECULES, ETC., IN REGENERATIVE, CLOSED-LOOP ARTIFICAL KIDNEYS, SUCH AS THE ELECTROCHEMICALLYREGENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL KIDNEY BEING DEVELOPED BY GINER, INC. AND THE REDY SYSTEM, AND (2) AN ARTIFICIAL KIDNEY BASEDON THE ADSORPTION OF UREA USING CARBON.",

THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE MORE SOPHISTICATED MACHINE VISION SYSTEMS (MVS) PRESENTLY AVAILABLE ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON VIDEO SIGNAL PROCESSING BY DIGITAL COMPUTER. BECAUSE OF THE TWO DIMENSIONAL NATURE OF THE INPUT, THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THAT MUST BE PROCESSED FOR EACH OBJECT IS VAST. THIS IMPLIES THAT THE DECISION PROCESS IS EITHER SLOW OR REQUIRES EXPENSIVE HARDWARE.

A HOST OF PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE, HOWEVER, WHICH CAN BE USED TO MODIFY THE NATURAL PROPERTIES OF AN ASPHALT CONCRETE. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS RESEARCH ARE TO IDENTIFY THE MOST PROMISING TYPES OF ADDITIVES FOR REDUCING PERMANENT DEFORMATION IN AIRFIELD PAVEMENT. SELECTION WILL BE BASED ON (1) A LITERATURE REVIEW, (2) LABORATORY TESTING OF SELECTED BINDER AND BINDER-AGGREGATE MIXTURES, (3) FIELD PERFORMANCE ESTIMATES, AND (4) AN ANALYSIS OF ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY. BINDER TESTS WILL INCLUDE PENETRATION AND VISCOSITY AT TWO TEMPERATURES AND DUCTILITY. THESE TESTS WILL BE PERFORMED BEFORE AND AFTER AGING IN A ROLLING THIN-FILM OVEN. MIXTURE TESTS WILL INCLUDE MARSHALL STABILITY AND FLOW, RESILIENT MODULUS AT TWO TEMPERATURES, CREEP AT TWO TEMPERATURES, AND SPLITTING TENSILE STRENGTH. THE MIXTURE TESTRESULTS WILL BE USED WITH STATE-OF-THE-ART ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES TO ESTIMATE THE ADDITIVES EFFECTS ON FIELD PERFORMANCE.",

THE PHASE-CHANGES ARE CONTROLLABLE BY VALVING THE THE FLOW OF HYDROGEN, FROM ONE HYDRIDE TO ANOTHER, REGARDLESS OF TEMPERATURE. THE UNUSUAL CAPABILITIES OF HYDRIDE HEAT PUMPS, REFRIGERATORS AND THERMAL STORAGE DEVICES, RESULT FROM THE ABILITY OF THE GAS PHASE, HYDROGEN, TO \"VAPORIZE\" IN ONE HYDRIDE CONTAINER AND \"CONDENSE\" IN ANOTHER, AT VASTLY DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES, WITHOUT THE NEED FOR A COMPRESSOR.

THE INTENSITY DISTRIBUTION OF THE EMITTED RADIATION EMITTED PERPENDICULAR TO THE BEAM IS A MEASURE OF THE LOCATION OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD CONTOUR IN THE PATH OF THE LASER. A STREAK CAMERA CAN BE USED TO MEASURE THE TEMPORAL MOTION OF THE CONTOURS AND A FRAMING CAMERA CAN BE USED TO RECORD THE SPATIAL PROFILE OF THE CONTOURS. MORE THAN ONE MAGNETIC FIELD CONTOUR CAN BE SIMULTANEOUSLY RECORDED USING AN ELECTRONIC TRANSITION HAVING A COMPLEX ZEEMAN SPECTRUM.

A PRELIMINARY STUDY OF OLIGOMERS FROM THE TYPE 2 COLONIAL FORM OF NEISSERIA GONORRHOEAE HAS SHOWN THAT THEY WERE BETTER THAN INTACT PILI FOR ELICITING ANTIBODIES THAT CROSS-REACT WITH PILI FROM HETEROLOGOUS STRAINS. THIS RESULT SUGGESTS THAT A VACCINE CONTAINING OLIGOMERS SHOULD PROVIDE BETTER CROSS-PROTECTION THAN ONE CONTAINING INTACT PILI. IN THIS PROPOSAL, ANTIBODIES ELICITED BY OLIGOMERS FROM UP TO 10 STRAINS OF NEISERRIA GONORRHOEAE WILL BE EXAMINED TO (1) CONFIRM THEIR CAPACITY FOR CROSS-REACTIVITY WITH INTACT PILI FROM HETEROLOGOUS STRAINS, AND (2) DETERMINE THEIR CAPACITY FOR PREVENTING BACTERIAL ADHESION TO HUMAN CELLS. IF A SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE FOR THE USE OF OLIGOMERS IS INDICATED, A PHASE II APPLICATION WOULD BE MADE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PROTOTYPE GONORRHEA VACCINE BASED ON THOSE STRAINS YIELDING OLIGOMERS WITH THE GREATEST DEGREE OF CROSS-REACTIVITY.",

        "abstract": "THE MASS OF DNA SEPARATED BY GEL ELECTROPHORESIS CAN BE DETERMINED FROM THE INTENSITY OF THE FLUORESCENCE OF A DNA-SPECIFIC DYE EXCITED BY UV RADIATION. THE PRESENT USE OF PHOTOGRAPHIC FILM TO RECORD THE FLUORESCENCE LIMITS THE ACCURACY, SENSITIVITY, AND DYNAMIC RANGE OF THE ANALYSIS. ALTERNATE SCANNING SYSTEMS THAT DIRECTLY DETECT THE FLUORESCENCE ARE SLOW. A NEW IMAGING SYSTEM IS PLANNED TO MEASURE BOTH THE MASS AND THE MOLECULAR WEIGHT OF THE SAMPLE. SUBSTANTIAL INSTRUMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS APPEAR POSSIBLE IN FLUORESCENT EXCITATION, OPTICAL LIGHT COLLECTION AND IMAGING, AND DETECTOR PERFORMANCE. REPLACINGFILM WITH A CHARGE-COUPLED ARRAY DETECTOR (CCD) NOW APPEARS ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE OF RECENT IMPROVEMENTS IN CCD PERFORMANCEAND THE AVAILABILITY OF LARGER ARRAYS AT LOWER COST. THOSE OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF THE STAINED DNA/GEL SYSTEM WILL BE MEASURED, WHICH MUST BE WELL-CHARACTERIZED TO DESIGN A HIGH PERFORMANCE IMAGING SYSTEM AND TO ESTIMATE ITS PERFORMANCE WITH USEFUL ACCURACY. AN ENGINEERING ANALYSIS OF A SPECIFIC DESIGN WILL EXAMINE THE INCREASED ANALYTICAL ABILITY TO QUANTITATE THE MASS OF DNA IN A BAND THROUGH IMPROVED FLUORESCENCE MEASUREMENT, AND WHETHER THE OVERALL MEASUREMENT TIME CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTENED BY ACHIEVING HIGH DETECTOR SIGNAL-TO-NOISE AND BY MORE FULLY AUTOMATING THE MEASUREMENT. THE PHASE I STUDY WILL ADDRESS THE FEASIBILITY OF THE NEW INSTRUMENTAL APPROACH, ESTIMATE THE LIMITS OF PERFORMANCE, AND PROVIDE A DESIGN DIRECTION FOR THE PROTOTYPE HARDWARE TO FOLLOW IN PHASE II.",

SEVERAL FULL-LENGTH CLONES WERE CHARACTERIZED AND FOUND TO BE APPROXIMATELY 2,100 BP LONG. THE PN CLONES CONTAINED A 1,260 BP OPEN-READING FRAME THAT DEFINES A 401-AMINO ACID PROTEIN WITH A CHARACTERISTIC LEADER PEPTIDE OF 19 AMINO ACIDS. TWO OF THE FULL-LENGTH CDNA CLONES HAVE BEEN SEQUENCED, AND PNB DIFFER BY TWO AMINO ACIDS, WHICH IS THE RESULT OF INSERTION OF A THREE-BASE CODON, CAG, INTO THE CODING SEQUENCE. THIS THREE-BASE INSERTION PRESERVES THE CODING FRAME, BUT CHANGES THE AMINO ACID SEQUENCE FOR PNA FROM ARG TO THR-GLY IN PNB. THE INSERTION OF THE TRIPLET MAY BE THE RESULT OF AN ALTERNATE SPLICE IN THE 3' REGION OF THE PN GENE. CURRENT STUDIES WILL FOCUS ON DETERMINING THE MECHANISM BY WHICH PNA AND PNB ARISE AND COMPARING THE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES OF THESE PNS. THE STRUCTURE OF THE PN-I GENE WILL BE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE IF THE REGION ENCODING THE INSERTED TRIPLET IS LOCATED AT AN INTRON/EXON JUNCTION AS WOULD BE PREDICTED BY THE MODEL FOR ALTERNATE SPLICING OF THE PRECURSOR MRNA.

THIS MEASUREMENT METHOD IS CALLED ABSORPTIONDIGITAL REFRACTOMETRY. THE MOST ACCURATE METHOD AT PRESENT FOR OBTAINING REFRACTIVE INDICES IS WITH THE DIVIDED CIRCLE PRISM SPECTROMETER. IT IS CAPABLE OF DETERMINING THE REFRACTIVE INDEX TO SIX DECIMAL PLACES WITH AN ACCURACY OF 1X10-6.

SALVAGE FUZING OF INTERCEPTED WARHEADS COULD PRODUCE NUCLEAR EXPLOSIONS AT THESE ALTITUDES. KNOWLEDGE OF THE RESULTING NUCLEAR ENVIRONMENT CAN BE USED TO IMPROVE SDI SYSTEMS PERFORMANCE. FOR BURST ALTITUDES AROUND 1500 KM, EXPANDING DEBRIS IS EXPECTED TO SLOW PREDOMINATELY BY MAGNETIC FORCES. THEORETICAL UNDERSTANDING OF NUCLEAR BURSTS IN THIS MAGNETIC CONFINEMENT REGIME IS VERY LIMITED BECAUSE EXISTING TEST DATA IS AT MUCH LOWER ALTITUDES. STUDY OF DEBRIS EXPANSION HERE COULD BE PURSUED VIA AN AXISYMMETRIC, THREE DIMENSIONAL, HYBRID (ELECTRON FLUID/ION PARTICLES) CODE TO EXAMINE WAVE-PARTICLE INSTABILITIES, IN COMBINATION WITH A PROCEDURE FOR INCLUDING THEIR EFFECTS IN FASTER MHD FLUID-LIKE CALCULATIONS. TO PREPARE GROUNDWORK FOR SUCH STUDY, THE PHASE I OBJECTIVES ARE: (1) TO ESTIMATE PHYSICAL PARAMETER RANGES VIA MHD CALCULATION OF THE MAGNETIC BUBBLE SHAPE AND TIME TO ITS MAXIMUM EXPANSION; (2) TO DESIGN AN AXISYMMETRIC HYBRID PLASMA TREATMENT AND DETERMINE LIMITS ON APPLICABILITY TO COUPLING SHELL EXPANSION; AND (3) TO EXAMINE THE PRACTICALITY OF A TRUNCATED MOMENT METHOD FOR INCLUDING WAVEPARTICLE EFFECTS IN MHD APPROACHES.",

THE PROPOSED RESEARCH DEVELOPS A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO UNDERSTANDING STRESS TOLERANCE. ALUMINUM TOXICITY HAS BEEN CHOSEN AS A MODEL STRESS. THIS PROPOSAL UTILIZES THE GENUS CERATOPTERIS AS AN EXPERIMENTAL PLANT SYSTEM AS WELL AS ALUMINUM TOLERANT AND SENSITIVE CULTIVARS OF SORGHUM. NPI HAS A LARGE NUMBER X-IRRADIATED MUTANTS OF CERATOPTERIS WHICH ARE A1 TOLERANT. THE ADVANTAGE OF UTILIZING CERATOPTERIS IS THAT MUTATIONS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED IN THE SINGLE CELL HAPLOID SPORE STAGE. AFTER GERMINATION, THE GAMETOPHYTES CAN BE SELFED TO PRODUCE COMPLETELY HOMOZYGOUS DIPLOID PLANTS. THE IDENTIFICATION OF THESE MUTATIONS SHOULD IDENTIFY THE GENES INVOLVED IN A1 TOLERANCE. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS APPROACH, NPI HAS PROPOSED TO IDENTIFY THE GENES INVOLVED IN A1 TOLERANCE BY SCREENING A CDNA LIBRARY FROM SORGHUM WITH POLYA+ RNA FROM A1 TOLERANT AND SENSITIVE CULTIVARS OF SORGHUM. THOSE SEQUENCES WHOSE TRANSCRIPTION IS AFFECTED (QUALITATIVELY OR QUANTITATIVELY) WILL BE IDENTIFIED AND STUDIED IN DEPTH.

MANY OF THE CURRENT STEPS FOR IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION TO FROZEN SECTIONS AND CYTOSPINS DO NOT GIVE OPTIMUM RESULTS WITH FIXED, PARAFFIN-EMBEDDED SECTIONS.

TO DEMONSTRATE THE OPTICAL SENSOR CONCEPT, A PRESURE SENSOR WILL BE DESIGNED AND FABRICATED FOR APPLICATION IN THE EMP/EMI, HIGH-TEMPERATURE CONDITIONS OF TURBINE ENGINE TEST INSTRUMENTATION. THE SENSOR CONSISTS OF A BROADBAND LIGHT SOURCE COUPLED INTO AN OPTICAL FIBER WHICH TRANSMITS THIS BROADBAND SPECTRUM TO THE REMOTE SENSOR ELEMENT. THE SENSOR ELEMENT IS A VARIABLE GAP FABRYPEROT CAVITY WHICH MODULATES THE REFLECTED SPECTRUM ACCORDING TO GAP DIMENSION. THE REFLECTED SPECTRUM IS FIBER-TRANSMITTED BACK TO A MICROPROCESSOR BASED, COLOR DEMODULATION SYSTEM. THIS COLOR DEMODULA-TION IS ACCOMPLISHED BY PRISM DISPERSION OVER A CHARGE-COUPLED-DEVICE (CCD).

WITH THE SPECIFICATIONS IN HAND, AN IN-HOUSE PILOT PLANT WILL PRODUCE ABOUT 1000 LBS (DRY) OF EACH ANTHRACITE/WATER SLURRY FOR COMBUSTION TESTING IN THE EXISTING FIRE-TUBE BOILER TO ESTABLISH THE COMBUSTION EFFICIENCY OF THAT FUEL. ALL DATA WILL BE REVIEWED IN THE FINAL REPORT WHICH WILL ALSO INCLUDE AN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND CONVERSION COSTS.",

THE PRIMARY THRUST OF THE PROPOSED PROGRAM IS TO DEVELOP A COMPUTATIONAL FRAMEWORK THAT PROPERLY ACCOUNTS FOR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ICE ACCUMULATION ON THE TRAILING WIRE AND THE WIRE TOWING DYNAMICS. VARIOUS TECHNIQUES FOR CONTROLLING ICE FORMATION WILL BE EVALUATED. EXPERIMENTAL PLANS WILL BE DEVELOPED TO DEMONSTRATE THE VALIDITY OF THE ANALYTICAL TOOLS AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ICE BUILDUP CONTROL TECHNIQUES.",

RATHER THAN USING A MAGNETIC FIELD TO MODULATE CONDUCTIVITY OR CURRENT FLOW, THE PROPOSED SENSOR MODULATES OPTICAL TRANSMISSION. THE MAGNETIC RESPONSE OF A LIQUID CRYSTALLINE MEDIUM IS GREATLY INCREASED BY THE ADDITION OF CERTAIN SMALL PARTICLES. IN THE LIQUID CRYSTAL MEDIUM THESE PARTICLES SPONTANEOUSLY ALIGN TO FORM SMALL CHAINS. THE MOTION OF THESE CHAINS AFFECTS THE LIQUID CRYSTAL OPTICAL PROPERTIES. THE DEVICE, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, MIMICS BACTERIA WHICH SENSE THE DIRECTION OF THE EARTH'S MAGNETIC FIELD. THE EFFECT OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD ON THE COMPOSITE OPTICAL MEDIUM CAN BE COUNTERBALANCED BY AN ELECTRIC FIELD SUCH THAT NO CHANGE IN OPTICAL PROPERTIES TAKES PLACE. THE VOLTAGE NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN THIS BALANCE IS A DIRECT MEASURE OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD STRENGTH. BECAUSE OF THIS BALANCING MECHANISM, THE MEASURED MAGNETIC FIELD STRENGTHS CAN BE QUITE LARGE OR SMALL, AND INTERFEROMETRIC METHODS CAN BE APPLIED TO ACHIEVE VERY HIGH SENSITIVITIES.

THE INITIAL RESEARCH WILL FOCUS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SERUM-FREE MEDIUM THAT WILL SUPPORT THE GROWTH AND DIFFERENTIATION OF ERYTHROCYTES, GRANULOCYTES, MACROPHAGES, AND LYMPHOCYTES. SPECIFIC ATTENTION WILL BE PAID TO THE PURITY OF EACH COMPONENT AND ONLY HUMAN COMPOUNDS WILL BE USED WHERE BIOLOGICAL COMPONENTS ARE FOUND NECESSARY. SUCH STUDIES WILL EMPLOY THE IN VITRO ASSAYS THAT ARE ROUTINELY USED FOR HEMATOPOIETIC CELLS. THE INITIAL SERUM-FREE MEDIUM WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR THE PROLIFERATION OF NORMAL HUMAN PERIPHERAL BLOOD LYMPHOCYTES AND SUBSEQUENTLY MODIFIED FOR BONE MARROW CELLS. THIS APPROACH SHOULD NOT ONLY LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SERUM-FREE MEDIUM BUT ELUCIDATE THE ROLE EACH COMPONENT PLAYS IN HEMATOPOIESIS. PHASE I WILL PRIMARILY USE ERYTHROCYTES, GRANULOCYTES, AND MACROPHAGES TO GAIN AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMPONENTS THAT WILL SUPPORT PROLIFERATION AND DIFFERENTIATION OF HEMATOPOIETIC CELLS. PHASE II WILL EXTEND THIS EFFORT TO DEVELOP A SERUM-FREE MEDIUM FOR ALL THE HUMAN HEMATOPOIETIC CELLS. SUCH A MEDIUM WILL BE USEFUL FOR STANDARDIZING IN VITRO HEMATOPOIETIC ASSAYS AND TRANSPLANTATION STUDIES WHERE SPECIFIC BONE MARROW POPULATIONS NEED TO BE EXPANDED.",

        "abstract": "THERE IS A REAL NEED AND MARKET DEMAND FOR INTELLIGENT KNOWLEDGE-BASED PROCESS CONTROL SYSTEMS, BUT THE COMPUTATIONAL DEMANDS ON SUCH SYSTEMS ARE FORMIDABLE. MANY PROCESSES REQUIRE MONITORS TO TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION WHEN AN ABNORMAL CONDITION ARISES, OR JUST TO MAKE ONGOING ADJUSTMENTS TO MAXIMIZE EFFICIENCY. IN COMPLEX SYSTEMS THE MONITORING TASK CAN BE TEDIOUS AND SOMETIMES OVERLY DEMANDING FOR HUMAN OPERATORS. AUTOMATED PROCESS CONTROL SYSTEMS ARE ALSO VALUABLE EVEN FOR VERY SIMPLE PROCESSES, TO MINIMIZE THE DEMANDS FOR HUMAN INTERVENTION. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT WHEN A PROCESS IS MONITORED IN HAZARDOUS OR INACCESSIBLE ENVIRONMENTS. QUINTUS COMPUTER SYSTEMS PROPOSES TO MEET THIS CHALLENGE BY PROVIDING SPECIALIZED PROCESS CONTROL TOOLS THAT WILL RUN EFFECTIVELY IN A MULTIPROCESSING ENVIRONMENT THAT WILL SUPPORT THE LATEST ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGY. HOOKS FOR EFFICIENT TRANSFER OF DATA STRUCTURES FROM FOREIGN SOFTWARE AND SENSORS ARE PROVIDED, AND THE INFERENCE ENGINE PROPOSED IS A PRIORITY-BASED REASONING TOOL THAT CAN QUICKLY RECOGNIZE AND RESPOND TO SIGNIFICANT EVENTS. THIS SYSTEM WILL PROVIDE AN OPERATOR WITH THE BASIS OF A VALUABLE MONITORING AND DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM, AND POSSIBLY EVEN ELIMINATE THENEED FOR SUBSTANTIAL HUMAN INTERVENTION IN SOME CASES.",

THIS MAY RESULT IN HIGH WATER-TO-OIL-PRODUCING RATIOS AND ABANDONMENT OF A PROJECT AT A RELATIVELY LOW VOLUMETRIC SWEEP EFFICIENCY. ONE APPROACH TO IMPROVED SWEEP EFFICIENCY IS TO PLACE A GELLED POLYMER INTO THE HIGH PERMEABILITY ZONES, THEREBY DIVERTING THE INJECTED FLUID INTO TIGHTER PARTS OF THE ROCK.CURRENT TECHNOLOGY RELIES ON THE INJECTION OF GELLED OR GELLING POLYMER SOLUTIONS INTO THE HIGH PERMEABILITY INTERVALS NEAR THE WELLBORE TO PLUG THEM. THE SOLUTIONS GELWITHIN A DAY OR TWO; THUS TREATMENT IS CONFINED TO THE REGION IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF THE WELLBORE. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS TREATMENT IS OFTEN LIMITED BY CROSSFLOW OF THE INJECTED FLUID BETWEEN HIGH AND LOW PERMEABILITY REGIONS. THAT IS, WHEN THE TREATMENT IS CONFINED TO THE REGION NEAR THE WELL THE INJECTED FLUID MAY SIMPLY FLOW AROUND THE TREATED REGION AND INTO THE HIGH PERMEABILITY ZONE. IT IS PLANNED TO INVESTIGATE AN INNOVATIVE PROCESS THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR IN-DEPTH PERMEABILITY MODIFICATION, THUS REDUCING THE EFFECT OF CROSSFLOW.

CONTACT RESISTANCE IS A PROBLEM EVEN WITH NEWLY FABRICATED MECHANICAL G-SWITCHES. MECHANICAL CONTACTS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO SWITCH BOUNCE AND DAMAGE DURING THE INITIAL SHOCK OF IMPACT. SILICON DESIGNS HAS DEVELOPED A PROCESS FOR BUILDING MICROMECHANICAL SENSE ELEMENTS ON THE SURFACE OF A SILICON WAFER THAT CONTAINS SENSING CIRCUITRY FABRICATED WITH STANDARD INTEGRATED CIRCUIT (IC) TECHNOLOGY. THIS ALLOWS THE LARGE QUANTITY PRODUCTION OF ACCELEROMETERS WITH SOPHISTICATED ACCOMPANYING ELECTRONICS AT A LOW COST. EACH TRANSDUCER CHIP IS THEN PACKAGED MUCH LIKE STANDARD ICS. SENSE ELEMENTS CAN BE DESIGNED FOR A WIDE RANGE OF ACCELERATIONS. HIGH RELIABILITY, LOW-COST G-SWITCHES CAN BE BUILT WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY THAT DO NOT RELY ON METAL-TO-METAL CONTACTS. IN ADDITION, EACH SENSOR CAN BE INDIVIDUALLY CALIBRATED AFTER FABRICATION, RESULTING IN HIGH PRODUCTION YIELDS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT ELECTRONIC G-SWITCHES CAN BE MANUFACTURED USING THIS TECHNOLOGY IN HIGH VOLUMES FOR LESS THAN $5 EACH, POSSIBLY IN THE $2-3 RANGE, DEPENDING ON THE TEST REQUIREMENTS.",

CURRENTLY, A NUMBER OF IN VITRO SCREENING TESTS ARE USED TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC DRUGS. MOST OF THESE TESTS UTILIZE NONHUMAN (MOSTLY RODENT) CELL LINES THAT MAY NOT DISTINGUISH SPECIES-SPECIFIC DIFFERENCES IN TOXICITY OF CHEMICALS BETWEEN HUMANS AND RODENTS. ALTHOUGH A FEW HUMAN CELL LINES (HT-29, A549, KB) ARE CURRENTLY USED TO SCREEN CHEMICALS FOR THEIR CYTOTOXICITIES, NONE OF THEM ARE RESPONSIVE TO ESTROGENS OR ANTIESTROGENS. BECAUSE IN RECENTYEARS PATIENTS WITH HORMONE-RESPONSIVE SOLID TUMORS HAVE BEEN TREATED WITH BOTH ENDOCRINE DRUGS (ANTIESTROGENS) AND OTHER CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENTS, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO DEVELOP ANIN VITRO SCREENING TEST WITH APPROPRIATE HUMAN ESTROGEN-SENSITIVE AND ESTROGEN-NONSENSITIVE CELL LINES. USE OF HUMAN CELL LINES WILL ALSO BE MORE RELEVANT IN VIEW OF THE DIFFERENCES IN THE SPECIES-SPECIFIC CYTOTOXICITY OF ANUMBER OF COMPOUNDS. SITEK RESEARCH LABORATORIES PROPOSES TO DEVELOP A RELIABLE PROTOCOL FOR A RAPID, IN VITRO TEST USING ESTROGEN-RESPONSIVE AND ESTROGEN-NONRESPONSIVE HUMAN CELL LINES. SUCH A TEST WILL BE SENSITIVE, RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE, AND ALLOW THE EVALUATION OF A NUMBER OF SAMPLESAT THE SAME TIME.

LIGHT SCAN, IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS PROPOSAL, REFERS TO THE TRANSILLUMINATION OFTHE BREAST BY RED AND NEAR-INFRARED LIGHT, WITH EXAMINATION OF BOTH ABSOLUTE TRANSMISSION AND THE RATIO OF TRANSMISSION AT THE TWO FREQUENCIES. SUCH LIGHT SCANS CAN INTERROGATE THE BREAST VOLUME FOR TISSUE THAT MAY BE MALIGNANT TO PROVIDE ORIENTATION FOR A SECOND, NONIONIZING MODALITY, DOPPLER ULTRASOUND. DURING PHASE I, SPECTRASCAN, INC. WILL DEVELOP, THROUGH BOTHMATHEMATICAL SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENTATION, PRACTICAL TRANSDUCER DESIGNS FOR AN ULTRASOUND DOPPLER SPECIFICALLY SUITED TO EARLY DETECTION OF BREAST CANCER. THE ELECTRONIC CIRCUITRY AND COMPUTER SOFTWARE TO IMPLEMENT A PRACTICAL BREAST CANCER-DETECTING DOPPLER FOR USE IN THE CLINICAL SETTING WILL BE DESIGNED, CONSTRUCTED, AND TESTED. A PROTOTYPE SYSTEM SUITABLE FOR CLINICAL TESTING COMBINING LIGHT SCANNING AND DOPPLER ULTRASOUND WILL BE DESIGNED AND CONSTRUCTED. IN PHASE II, CLINICAL STUDIES WILL BE INITIATED TO DEMONSTRATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMBINED MODALITY IN TERMS OF THE RECEIVER-OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS. THE PROTOTYPE SYSTEM WILL BE FURTHER REFINED TO A PRACTICAL UNITSUITABLE FOR COMMERCIAL APPLICATION.",

NITROGEN IS THE MAJOR IMPURITY OF DIAMONDS (UP TO 0.3 AT.%) AND PLAYS A MAJOR ROLE IN INFLUENCING THEIR OPTICAL AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES. ION IMPLANTATION OF DIAMOND HAS BEEN STUDIED BYA NUMBER OF RESEARCHERS FOR ELECTRICALLY DOPING BUT THERE ARE ONLY TWO KNOWN REPORTS IN THE LITERATURE WHICH ADDRESS THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF IMPLANTED DIAMONDS. BRITISH WORKERS (1) FIND THAT B-AND N-IMPLANTED DIAMONDS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR IN BOTH LABORATORY WEAR TESTS AND INDUSTRIAL MACHINING TESTS. A RECENT REPORT FROM CHINA(2) SUGGESTS THAT IMPLANTATION REDUCES MICROCLEAVAGING THOUGHT TO BE AN IMPORTANT WEAR MECHANISM OF DIAMOND. THESE STUDIES, ALTHOUGH PROVOCATIVE, RAISE MORE QUESTIONS THAN THEY ANSWER. THE PRESENT PROPOSAL ADDRESSES MANY OF THE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS OF WHEN AND WHY DOES IMPLANTATION IMPROVE THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF DIAMOND.

A NECESSARY PART OF SUCH OPERATIONS IS THE REGENERATION OF THE ACTIVATED CARBON WITH SIMULTANEOUS RECOVERY OF THE ORGANIC MATERIAL, WHICH IS GENERALLY VERY INEFFICIENT EXCEPT FOR HIGHLY VOLATILE MATERIALS. GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS NOW RESTRICT THE ALLOWABLE CONCENTRATIONS OF VOLATILE ORGANIC SOLVENTS FROM THESE OPERATIONS THAT CAN BE EMITTED TO THE ATMOSPHERE. IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO RECOVER THE ORGANICS FOR REUSE IN THE OPERATION. AN ENTIRELY NEW REGENERATION TECHNIQUE, CALLED SURFACTANT-ENHANCED CARBON REGENERATION (SECR) IS BEING INVESTIGATED FOR RECOVERY OF ORGANICS EMITTED BY THE PRINTING AND PAINTING INDUSTRY. WITH SECR, THE ABSORBER CONTAINING THE USED, SPENT CARBON IS TREATED WITH A CONCENTRATED SURFACANT SOLUTION. THE ORGANIC MATERIAL ON THE SPENT CARBON IS DESORBED AND SOLUBILIZED IN THE SURFACTANT SOLUTION. THEN, THE SURFACTANT IS PRECIPITATED AND RECYCLED TO THE PROCESS. SETTLING YIELDS SEPARATION OF THE ORGANIC AND THE WATER. AFTER FLUSHING WITH WATER, THE CARBON IS RETURNED TO SERVICE WITH DRYING FOR USE IN AIR STREAMS. THE PROCESS HAS POTENTIAL FOR ENERGY EFFICIENT, LOW TOXICITY, ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE, LOW COST RECOVERY OF FUGITIVE ORGANIC VAPORS WITH MINIMAL HANDLING OF SOLID MATERIALS. IN THE PHASE I WORK, ORGANICS USED IN PRINTING/PAINTING WILL BE CARRIED THROUGH ALL THE PROCESS STEPS. PERFORMANCE DATA WILL BE OBTAINED ON EVERY STEP, INCLUDING RATES AND CONCENTRATIONS.

THESE PROBLEMS OCCUR BECAUSE NEARLY SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE PROPELLANT CHEMICAL ENERGY, REMAINS IN THE GAS IN THE FORM OF THERMAL AND KINETIC ENERGY. THE AFOREMENTIONED PROBLEMS ARE A DIRECT RESULT OF THIS ABUNDANCE OF HOT, HIGH-PRESSURE GAS THAT IS RAPIDLY VENTED FROM THE BARREL. THE KEY TO ALLEVIATING THIS PROBLEM IS TO DIVERT GAS FROM THE BARREL SO THAT THE GAS CONDITIONS AT THE BARREL EXIST HAVE BEEN EXPANDED TO LOWER PRESSURE, REDUCED TEMPERATURE AND LESS OVERALL KINETIC ENERGY. THE DIVERTED GAS IS THEN DISPERSED SEPARATELY SO THAT THE VOLUME AND, THEREFORE, THE ENERGY DENSITY OF THE EXHAUST GAS IS DECREASED TO LEVELS THAT ELIMINATE SEVERE BLAST AND FLASH. VERITAY PROPOSESD TO DEVELOP THE METHODOLOGY FOR PREDICTING FLOW CONDITIONS, PROBLEM ASSESSMENT, AND DESIGN DEVELOPMENT. FOUR DESIGN CONCEPTS WILL BE FORMULATED AND EVALUATED, THREE THAT DIVERT GAS AT THE MUZZLE AND THE OTHER THAT DIVERTS GAS AT THE BREECH.

IN THIS PROPOSAL, A SERIES OF NEW CHELATING AGENTS WILL BE PREPARED FROM CHITOSAN. CHITOSAN IS A MODIFICATION OF THE BIOPOLYMER CHITIN, A POLYSACCHARIDEFOUND IN THE EXOSKELETON OF CRUSTACEANS. IN THIS PROPOSED PROGRAM, CHITOSAN WILL BE DEPOLYMERIZED, DERIVATIZED, AND FRACTIONATED INTO VARIOUS MOLECULAR WEIGHT RANGES USING MEMBRANES. THESE DIFFERENT MOLECULAR WEIGHT FRACTIONS WILL BE EVALUATED FOR ENHANCED CHELATION PROPERTIES AND SOLUBILITY OF THE COMPLEXES. THE DEGREE OF SUBSTITUTION OF CHITOSAN DERIVATIVES WILL BE OPTIMIZED TO ACHIEVE MAXIMUM CHELATION. THE AVAILABILITY OF DIFFERENT MOLECULAR WEIGHT DERIVATIVES WILL ALLOW ONE TO CHOOSE THE DESIRED SOLUBILITY OF THE CHELATION COMPLEX. THE SOLUBLE CHELATED METAL COMPLEXES WILL BE CONCENTRATED BYULTRAFILTRATION MEMBRANES. AFTER USING THIS ULTRAFILTRATIONMEMBRANE TECHNIQUE, THE AQUEOUS FILTRATE WILL CONTAIN VERY LOW CONCENTRATIONS OF METAL IONS, AND CAN THEN BE DISCHARGEDOR RECYCLED. THE RETENTATE WILL CONTAIN CONCENTRATED METAL IONS WITHIN THE CHITOSAN CHELATE. THE METAL IONS CAN THEN BE RECOVERED FROM THE CHITOSAN. THIS PROCEDURE CAN BE APPLIED TO WATER EFFLUENT AT INDUSTRIAL SITES. THE CHITOSAN DERIVATIVES IN THE MOLECULAR WEIGHT RANGE THAT PRODUCE INSOLUBLE CHELATION COMPLEXES CAN BE USED IN PRECIOUS METAL RECOVERY AS A MEANS OF CONCENTRATING THE METAL. THE METAL CAN THEN BE RECOVERED FROM THE COMPLEX. THE ENHANCED CHELATING ABILITY OF THESE NEW POLYMERS WILL ALLOW THEM TO COMPLETE ECONOMICALLY WITH SYNTHETIC CHELATINGAGENTS, THEREBY EXPANDING THE UTILIZATION OF WASTES PROCESSED FROM SHELLFISH.",

THE COST REDUCTION WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH THE ELIMINATION OF THE USUAL PRECIOUS METAL ELECTRODES.

IN PHASE I, CDNA WILL BE CLONED INTO A GEM-1 IN VITRO TRANSCRIPTION VECTOR. A PLASMID LIBRARY WILL BE ESTABLISHEDIN E. COLI. AFTER REPLICA PLATING, PLASMID DNA WILL BE PREPARED FROM SUBSETS OF THE LIBRARY AND LINEARIZED WITH RESTRICTION ENDONUCLEASES. RNA WILL BE TRANSCRIBED FROM THECDNA IN EACH POOL USING SP6 OR T7 RNA POLYMERASE. THE RNA POOLS WILL BE TRANSLATED IN FROG OOCYTES. EXPRESSION OF IL-3 WILL BE ASSESSED BY TISSUE CULTURE BIOLOGICAL ASSAYS. THOSE LIBRARY SUBSETS WHICH PRODUCE IL-3 ACTIVITY WILL BE FURTHER SUBDIVIDED UNTIL PURE CLONES OF IL-3 ARE ISOLATED. EXPRESSION OF BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE IL-3 IN PHASE IWILL PROVIDE INFORMATION FOR DETERMINING THE FEASIBILITY OF OBTAINING PRODUCTION LEVEL EXPRESSION IN PHASE II. FUTURE RESEARCH WILL INVOLVE SCALE-UP OF PRODUCTION AND PURIFICATION OF IL-3 TO COMMERCIAL LEVELS AND PERFORMANCE OF TRIALS TO DETERMINE SAFETY, DOSAGE, AND USEFULNESS OF THEDRUG.",

DURING TWO RECENT EXPERIMENTAL AEM FLIGHTS FOR BATHYMETRIC MISSIONS, THE METHOD HAS PROVED TO BE ABLE TO PROFILE MINUTE CHANGES IN WATER CONDUCTIVITY. THE ABILITY OF THE AEM METHOD TO PROFILE WATER CONDUCTIVITY LEADS US TO BELIEVE THAT THE METHOD CAN BE ADAPTED TO A SUBMARINE DETECTION MISSION. SPECIFICALLY, IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO LOCATE THE DISTURBANCE PLUME WHICH TAILS BEHIND SUBMARINES.
