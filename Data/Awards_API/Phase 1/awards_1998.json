        "abstract": "The feasibility of novel refractive surgeries has been demonstrated using sub-picosecond laser pulses.  However, the introduction of these techniques depends on the development of low cost, reliable, compact laser devices.  We propose to design, construct and test a directly diode-pumped Nd:Glass laser system consisting of a prismless oscillator, a single transmission grating stretcher-compressor, and an end-pumped regenerative amplifier.  The fully solid-state laser will have an approximately 8\"x14\" footprint and will deliver 500 fs pulses with energies up to 50 mJ at repetition rates of 3 kHz.  Corneal surgical procedures with the laser will be evaluated and the results used to guide laser design specifications for a commercial prototype, to be developed during Phase II.  If the proposed device satisfies clinical and commercial requirements, surgical correction of a wide variety of refractive errors may become more effective, safe and affordable.  By eliminating the need for eyeglasses and other corrective devices, the pool of potential military personnel can be increased, while the capabilities of current personnel can be strengthened.  Since the new laser device is designed to run on a simple car battery, dual use applications, such as high precision military ranging and remote sensing of air pollutants are also possible.",

        "abstract": "21st Century Systems, Inc. (2CSI, formed April 1996) proposes a tool suite which will combat architectural design errors in large-scale, high-assurance systems through systematic and intelligent simulation and modeling of alternate designs.  The suite will feature a wide range failure analysis, identification, isolation, correction and management tools, and will make use of many innovative resource allocation heuristics, and cost and objective functions.  The suite will facilitate failure management for collaborative, distributed system development and will incorporate a rich family of intelligent agents to assist in all human and automated functions.  Finally, the suite will be entirely COTS-based (Java, VRML, browsers) and will  run on common, inexpensive, Windows and Unix platforms.     21CSI builds tools for complex systems ineering and operation.  The company has pioneered the use of both affordable visualization and intelligent agents in design and decision support tools.  21CSI has already delivered or is delivering innovative tools and technologies to AF Armstrong Lab, AF SMC and DARPA.  21CSI is engaged in a major joint licensing with Telelogic, an investigation of technology transition with Boeing, a transition to SMC\u00bfs satellite management, and an investigation of a Navy-Air Force simulation and decision support system for Joint Forces Operations with the NRL.  We fully expect OSD funds to leverage third-party support.  For this project, a team with both a superb track record in systems, tools, visualization, failure analysis, and a solid knowledge of the sponsor\u00bfs problem domain has been assembled.  Under Phase I, 21CSI will deliver a report, a detailed design document and a prototype proof of concept.  Then, 21CSI will transition and commercialize the technology under combined Phase II and third-party funding.",

Prasad, Principal Investigator\nDr. Mahadevan Krishnan, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG03-98ER82524\nAmount:  $75,000\n\nImprovements in failure rates and reliability of current gas switches used for particle accelerator research are needed.  This project will develop a synthetic diamond switch which have shown promise as a replacement for thyratrons and other gas switches currently used in high voltage pulsed modulators.  Phase I will demonstrate concept feasibility by testing prototype switches at up to 50-80 kV hold-off and demonstrating ~10 nanosecond turn-on and turn-off.  Phase II would fully develop a diamond switch to replicate a high voltage thyratron\u00bfs capabilities.  The primary goal of the Phase I project is to extend current 15 kV hold-off technology to up to 50-80 kV in a single synthetic diamond membrane, while also achieving ~1 kA/cm2 current density and less than 30 nanosecond turn-on and turn-off.  Secondary objectives are to study repetition rates of the switch by firing two or more ~1 microsecond pulses in a burst, with ~1 microsecond inter-pulse delays.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   The product of this program would be a hardware item that could be used within the accelerator research community.  Beyond this application, the switch should also find use as a key enabling technology in many different high power modulators for laser drivers, RF sources, and other applications._",

        "abstract": "Alameda Applied Sciences Corporation (AASC) proposes to develop two components of a three-component, survivable debris shield for large area test exposures to cold (1-5keV) x-rays.  These elements also have commercial potential in accelerators and in radiography.  The elements are: an ultrafast gas curtain designed to be located close to the x-ray source to deflect plasma debris as well as ~um sized debris particles so that they miss the test object located at >15 cm from the source; a 1-D or 2-D grid that supports a thin soft x-ray window, making it far more robust than a free-standing foil, with high open area (~90%) and negligible artifacts in the test plane due to the grid structure.  The role of this robust transmissive membrane is to stop those particles that have not been deflected by the gas curtain.  These two elements are combined with an electromagnetic shutter, whose role is to stop larger but slower moving particles and late time hot gases.  The three-pronged defense proposed by AASC, the gas curtain, electromagnetic shutter and robust transmissive x-ray window, constitute a debris mitigation system that is useful for today's simulators, while being eminently scaleable to the larger fluence-area products required by tomorrow's simulators.  When z-pinch or laser produced plasmas are used as point x-ray or XUV sources for sub-micron lithography and microscopy, the mask/wafer region must be shielded from particulate debris.  The debris shields developed here might be suitable for this purpose.  Accelerator beamlines might also use these shields to protect delicate components from debris due to failures in vacuum beamlines or to make vacuum windows more robust.",

This film tends to degrade over time, even when stored in climate-controlled facilities.  In addition, drawings must be digitized before circuit boards can be manufactured, which is an expensive and time consuming step.  A reliable and repeatable artwork conversion process is needed.This project will perform the research required to assemble a PCB artwork conversion system, which can digitize Mylar based drawings.  The digital files created wil be in Gerber format, which is generally the format needed for printed circuit board manufacture.  The system will utilize commercial off the shelf (COTS) components wherever possible.  By using COTS components, system cost, maintenance, and upgrade costs will be minimized.Deliverables from this program will include an analysis of potential COTS hardware and software, which could be integrated to from an accurate, repeatable system for digitizing Mylar drawings.  Sources for software and hardware, a comparison of each product's capabilities and limitations, and the tolerances for each potential configuration will be documented.  Finally, each potential vendor will be sent a 'C' size Mylar drawing, and their generated Gerber files will be evaluated to determine the capability of each system.",

Brown, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG02-98ER82516\nAmount:  $74,548\n\nLandfill gas (contaminated methane and CO2) is a plentiful resource largely wasted by venting or flaring.   Landfill gas could provide CO\u00bf and energy to grow hothouse crops year-round in landfill-based greenhouse as well as methane gas for fuel cells.   However, a major technical/economic barrier to the wide commercial use of landfill CO2 and methane is contaminant removal.  This project will use separation technology to convert landfill gas to clean mixtures of CO2 and methane.  Phase I will develop experimental thermodynamic data and  integrated landfill gas process design(s) for greenhouse quality CO2 and fuel cell grade methane.   In particular, the removal of ethylene, a common landfill gas contaminant which is not welcome in greenhouses, will be addressed.  In Phase II, one ton  CO2/day will be produced for greenhouse comsumption and enough methane will be produced to power a 200k fuel cell.  \n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   The technology should lead to economic gas utilization at landfill sites with reduced greenhouse gas emissions.  Alternative landfill gas products include medium Btu gas; compressed or liquefied methane for pipeline gas, high pressure turbine fuel for cogeneration, or heavy vehicle fuel; methane-CO2 feedstocks for methanol and di-methyl ether; and merchant liquid CO2. _",

        "abstract": "ACX proposes an alternate approach to damping for extreme environments, which uses an electrically shunted, surface mounted, smart material.  This shunting approach has been most widely used in less extreme environments in conjunction with piezoceramic materials.  The smart material is bonded to the surface of the target structure, in this case a part inside an aircraft engine.  Stress on the part is transferred to the piezoelectric.  This in turn produces an electrical potential at the electrodes.  By discharging the voltage through an electrical network, damping can be accomplished.  For the resistive-inductive (RL) network, the result is the electrical equivalent of a tuned mass damper.The frequency selectivity of an electrically shunted smart material can be tailored to the specific application needs through the selection of the electronic shunt components.  Robust, broad band or dramatic narrow band reduction be achieved.  The advantages of such a proposed shunted smart material damping system include the flexibility to place it in a range of rotating and non-rotating environments, its ability to withstand large stresses with limited creep, the robustness of ceramic materials at high temperature, and its frequency selectivity.Phase I will design, fabricate and test an electronically shunted smart material damper package for extreme environments based on ACX's QuickPack technology, which encapsulates the piezoceramics in a protective skin.",

This system will combine the advantages of a capacitive actuator with feedback control capability. This system will possess the force and stroke characteristics of a small hydraulic device and the bandwidth of electric motors. Capacitive devices such as piezoceramic actuators exhibit much more desirable mechanical and electrical characteristics. They have a very efficient coupling of energy from applied charge to mechanical strain which results in a high bandwidth and large force output with negligible resistive heating.  The actuator system proposed will utilize piezoceramics with a mechanical advantage to magnify the piezoceramic actuation strain. The mechanical advantage will be accomplished by a flexural mechanical lever stage which is displaced by the piezoceramic motion. The actuator will be instrumented to provide position feedback under this proposed program. This internal servo loop will be implemented to ensure a high degree of accuracy to commanded displacements or forces. This accuracy is needed for actively controlled mounting systems and positioning devices.",

These applications require an intelligent control system which can adapt to the changes in its environment.ACX proposes to develop an adaptive, compact, integrated SmartPack for vibration reduction in systems with time-varying harmonic disturbances or uncertain time-invariant dynamics.  Each package would include actuators and sensors, drive and signal conditioning electronics as well as complex, intelligent controllers to yield a self-standing solution to a wide range of vibration problems.  The packaging will provide a protective skin offering electrical isolation, and a means for integration of sensors, signal conditioning and control electronics. The ability of the adaptive SmartPack to reduce vibration levels or perform structural control tasks in a time-varying disturbance environment will be evaluated during testing and characterization.  The Phase II effort would refine the design of the device, produce a manufacturing plan for high volume production, and isolate a target commercial application.",

        "abstract": "A unique approach is proposed for the effective rejection of cochannel, but otherwise arbitrary, jamming and other interference in GPS reception.  The approach is based on a method of processing a multiplicity of signals sharing the same time-frequency and polarization space, in such a way as to favor a bona fide GPS signal over the others present (jamming, spoofing, multipath, atmospherics or other cochannel signals/noise.)A Phase I effort/program is proposed herein to investigate analytically, with the aid of computer simulations, the effects on wideband signals of the unique signal processing operations performed in the proposed approach.  Wideband signals represent sentative of those received from GPS satellites will be the focus of the proposed investigations to determine quantitatively how their code waveforms.  The necessity for compensatory measures, and how best to implement such, to be undertaken in the receiver front end to counter likely distortions of the GPS signal, will also be determined.  A program will be evolved for validating and demonstrating experimentally the results of Phase I analyses in a follow-on Phase II effort, by means of actual GPS satellite signals derived in the laboratory either as generated internally to a Miniature Airborne GPS Receiver (MAGR); or by actual reception from GPS satellites, with retrofits to a MAGR using adaptations of hardware designs already successfully proven to function as required, plus other circuits or software to be defined in Phase I.  Anticipated benefits, both military and commercial, center on the absolute necessity of totally immunizing GPS receivers against cochannel interference/jamming/spoofing, in all situations of GPS-aided navigation and/or rescue location.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop refractive x-ray lenses for medical, industrial, scientific, and directed-energy applications. Previously, ordinary optical refractive lenses were assumed to not work at x-ray wavelengths because refractive effects were very small. Reflective and grazing angle techniques are usually limited to the soft x-ray region of the spectrum. Recently, multiple small cylindrical holes acting as quasi-lenses have been shown by Adelphi and a another group to focus moderate x-ray energies (8-14 keV). These quasi-lenses have reduced apertures because of the cylindrical shape and x-ray absorption at their thickest parts. We propose to develop a compound refractive lens (CRL) with larger effective apertures capable of operating at harder x-ray wavelengths where medical, industrial and directed energy applications abound. To improve the CRL's gain and achieve shorter focal length CRLs and two-dimensional focusing, we will investigate optimum materials and hole parameters for the lens array and achieve an ideal lens' surface curvature. These refractive optics will have the advantages of small size, in-line operation, better cooling efficiency and fewer perturbations due to surface roughness than conventional grazing-angle x-ray optics.",

PDCs are projected to significantly reduce the capital and operating costs of the boiler/furnace hardware for new power plants and increase the efficiency of existing power plants.  PDCs take advantage of the higher heat transfer of a detonative combustion process over the typical deflagrative combustion process used in conventional direct-fire pulverized coal burners, cyclone furnaces, and pulse deflagration combustors.  The initial development and bench scale testing in Phases I and II of a PDC for coal based power systems would validate the efficiency predictions and demonstrate the benefits of the technology.  The Phase I effort will focus on conceptual development activities that are critical to eventual proof-of-concept testing.  These activities include definition of power plant requirements for a PDC, assessment of PDC/boiler interfaces, a preliminary design of critical components, an assessment of the potential plant capital cost reductions possible with the PDC, and a quantification of prospective efficiency gains.\n \nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Several attractive uses for the coal-based PDC exist in the areas of utility and industrial power plants, namely as a combustion method for boiler applications._",

As networking technologies are integrated into CDL and new sensors are deployed, the demand for CDL bandwidth is increasing.  Specifically, the insertion of ATM into the CDL architecture has raised some issues concerning data integrity due to the higher bit error rates in the RF environment.  In addition, constraints on the command link (CL) bandwidth is a major concern; the addition of upper layer protocols to retransmit corrupted cells and other traffic on the command link is increasing the demand for CL bandwidth.ASI proposes to develop the CEL OPNET Analysis System (COAS) which will provide a robust simulation tool for CDL link performance.  COAS will be a discrete-event simulation tool for CDL link performance.  COAS will be a discrete-event simulation tool that provides the capability to perform both low and high fidelity modeling.  ASI will leverage previous CDL/ATM modeling experience to develop an improved CDL link model by 1) building an asymmetric ATM Link for CDL, 2) improving simulation runtime, 3) and integrating error allocation and error correction models with the CDL asymmetric link model to create a flexible, end-to-end CDL/ATM simulation tool.",

The accuracy of these solution approaches would be compared among themselves, with available commercial FE packages, and also with a novel variational analysis developed by AdTech for three-dimensional analysis of bonded joints and repairs.  The analysis methodologies that most accurately analyze the bonded repair situations will be integrated with the existing repair analysis computer programs as per the Air Force requirements.  This effort would result in user-friendly, validated computational tools for analyzing bonded composite repairs.

Thin films have inherently high breakdown strengths, and high quality thin film dielectrics of barium strontium titanate (BST) have been shown to have  superior charge storage density.   Further, modification of BST of certain B-site dopants results in lower dissipation and reduced eletrical degradation at elevated temperature.

The primary ferroelectric materials for these devices are perovskite oxides such as lead zirconium titanate (PZT) and strontium bismuth tantalate (SBT). These materials contain highly mobile elements (Pb and Bi) that can interact with silicon at process temperatures and lead to a high density of mobile charge traps at the interface. An additional oxide layer between the ferroelectric and silicon has been proposed to serve as a diffusion barrier. In practice, deposition of this barrier oxide typically involves introduction of oxygen at heated silicon wafer surface and an unwanted low permittivity silicon oxide layer is formed on the silicon surface.

The matrix materials selected for this program will be ZrC, HfC, and TaC. These-materials have good oxidation/corrosion and ablation resistance at elevated temperatures, but typically do not possess the thermal shock resistance and toughness necessary to survive in many propulsion applications. To enhance the thermal shock resistance and toughness of these materials, without compromising their ablation and corrosion response, this program will use a novel approach to fabricating ZrC-, HfC-, and TaC-based composites using the proven 'Fibrous Monolith' processing technology. The fibrous monolith process creates an interpenetrating microstructure of elongated polycrystalline cells of the matrix material, in this case high temperature carbides, separated by thin cell boundaries of a low shear strength refractory material, such as graphite or BN. This interpenetrating microstructure imparts toughness and thermal shock resistance to the material. The technology allows for the fabrication of complex composite architectures to be readily fabricated from inexpensive powders and polymers. Phase I success will allow future iterations to optimize these composites for DOD/NASA needs during Phases II and III.",

        "abstract": "In today's military environment ships, systems, and equipment are being asked to perform at levels not thought possible a decade ago.  The intent is to improve process operations and equipment reliability, availability, and maintainability without costly upgrades.  Of course, these gains must be achieved without impacting combat readiness.  Downsizing is also taking its toll on operations.  Loss of personnel, particularly those who represent the corporate history, is depleting the Navy of its valuable experiential base which has been so heavily relied on in the past.   These realizations are causing the Navy to rethink its condition-based maintenance policies, moving them away from reacting to equipment problems to taking a proactive approach to anticipate needs based on mission requirements.  This SBIR will develop a new approach to condition-based maintanance-Context Dependent Prognostics and Health Assessment.  This advanced diagnostics capability will be developed around a context dependent model that provides a capability to anticipate incipient system/element failures and determine machine performance over a protracted period of time.  This prognostic capability will link mission requirements to an economic performance model.  In this context, a system may provide 100% operability with less than 100% functionality.  This new paradigm will be integrated into the Navy enterprise system to facilitate optimal logistic supply and support.",

Specific capabilities for the proposed thermal imager are 1) non-intrusive, high temperature measurements, 2) multiple point (256 x 256) simultaneous measurements, 3) time-resolved measurements with controllable sampling intervals (1 ms - 50 ms), and 4) operate in harsh physical and EMI environments.  During the proposed 6 month effort, A2Z Technologies Corporation will perform initial measurements at Naval test facilities, test the interference environment produced by the pulsed x-ray sources, design the prototype instrument, and develop, test, and demonstrate a Phase I breadboard system.  All Phase I activities are for the purpose of proving the system feasibility.  In addition, a Phase I option is proposed that includes 1) additional system testing and 2) prototype system design.",

Existing software have neglected to characterize significant component data such as heat loads, cabin cooling requirements, battery thermal management, and heat rejection. Vehicle performance (accounting for environmental conditions and speed), both wheeled and tracked propulsion, and management of packaging data (component volume and weight) have also been previously not accounted for.  In order to efficiently and comprehensively model HEV systems with precision, the software model must be able to incorporate all of these characteristics while providing ease of user input, flexibility in making modifications, and easily understood graphical results.  Each vehicle component would be represented by a modular graphics icon from the extensive data base of pre-defined vehicle components and selected by the user by a drag-and-drop method for any given model.  Performance data for each component would include actual manufacturer specifications and corresponding icons would graphically indicate the required parameters/connections needed for proper operation of the system.  The component database would be unrestricted in size and configuration, allowing the user the flexibility of manipulating unlimited vehicle component models with the capability to study any conceivable vehicle configuration with ease.  BENEFITS:  The code to be developed will be specifically geared to hybrid electric vehicle simulations. However, with only small modification it will be broadly applicable to modeling any type of a mixed mechanical and electromechanical systems accounting for the conservation of mass, momentum and energy.

        "abstract": "The Pulse Detonation Engine (PDE) is an intermittent combustion engine that relies on traveling detonation waves for the combustion and compression elements of the prosulsive cycle.  This engine may be used as a low cost propulsion system in defense flight vehicle system applications or as the low speed cycle for a high Mach number combined cycle engine system.  The mechanical simplicity of this engine provides for low cost and high reliability permitting use in low cost vehicles.  The simple geometry naturally provides for integration into a new combined cycle engine with ramjets.  To date, APRI has focused on using highly reactive and detonable fuels in the development of PDE systems and subsystems.  Specifically, APRI has focused on the use of hydrogen fuel, for use in multi-mode PDE-ramjet-scramjet combined cycle systems.  However, the use of storable liquid hydrocarbon fuels that are of this engine in defense systems such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), cruise missiles, and target drones.  Hence this proposal describes the conceptual design for a practical low-cost PDE and a development path for the use of liquid hydrocarbon fuels in PDE's.",

CT scans of a sample part obtained from the Air Force will be usd to demonstrate that the new algorithms can be used for the fast generation of accurate computer aided design (CAD) models.

        "abstract": "The proposed work in phase I will address the problem of establishing the feasibility of a new approach for developing a system to be used with military land vehicles for the on-board recovery and purification of water.  The system will ultimately generate 15 gallons of potable water per day.  The aims are to produce a lightweight, compact, robust, reliable, and energy efficient unit that requires minimum maintenance.  The preferred source of water will be from the vehicle engine exhaust emissions, where it will be collected by condensation.  The principal challenge is the purification of this water.  The core of the proposed purification system relies upon different forms of novel, rigid fiber composite materials that will be used to produce a combined purification train.  The first section of the train will contain activated carbon fibers for the removal of organic contaminants and residual particulates.  The second section will contain immobilized ion exchange resin to remove ionic species, and final polishing will be achieved by another section of activated carbon fiber.  The train will be formed a single monolithic cartridge that will be sealed into a lightweight container.  The absence of moving parts or particulates means that the cartridge is extremely robust and resistant to movement under rugged conditions.  The same principles can be applied to the development of lightweight portable units for use in the field. The goals of phase I are to confirm that the system can be operated to meet potable water standards, to achieve a reasonable period of on-line service, and to provide reasonable estimates of production, maintenance, and operating costs.  The work will also establish whether there are any other practical requirements for a phase II development, such as the need to incorporate a disinfection protocol.  BENEFITS:  The market for on-board water recovery units include applications in both military and recreational vehicles.  Lightweight, rugged portable water treatment units is another potential application for this technology.",

The Phase I objectives include an assessment of CORBA architectural implications with respect to security evaluation criteria and certification requirements, and the development of an implementation approach for a high assurance data integrity mechanism. This data integrity mechanism is based on public key encryption methods and will prevent unauthorized information flows in conjunction with other security enforcement mechanisms.

Currently available Instantaneous Frequency Measurement Receivers (IFMR) have the desired instantaneous bandwidth and fast response, and are relatively small and lightweight.  However, they lack one key characteristic: they cannot determine the frequencies of two or more simultaneous signals.  The proposed effort is designed to eliminate this restriction and to provide IFMRs with multi-signal measuring capabilities.  Phase I will be based on the MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm developed by the Chief Investigator and on his US patent that showed how the algorithm can be used with an IFMR of novel design to measure the frequencies of simultaneous input signals.

Current armor systems significantly reduce the load carrying capacity of the helicopter thereby reducing its mission effectiveness. New innovative technologies to significantly reduce the areal density of armor is needed to make significant enhancements to survivability. The purpose of the proposed Phase I SBIR program will be to develop a new opaque armor technology which will enable significant reductions in areal density to be made.  This effort will specifically address urgent needs for Systems which effectively deal with the 12.7-mm threat. This is a threat highly applicable to helicopters and with ample room for further weight reductions.  Ideally a new armor technology could be developed under this program which would reduce the weight of 12.7-mm API armor from the current minimum of 7.7 lbs/ft(2) to below 5.0 lbs/ft(2).

Additionally, AeroChem will develop the hardware and software needed to properly decouple the emission characteristics of the various luminophors and to incorporate these new coatings into existing PSP measurement systems.  The resulting product will be compatible with conventional emission integration and lifetime measurement systems and will meet the mandated measurement accuracy of1% for Phase I and 0.2% for Phase II.  The new coating and system advancements will eliminate or minimize many difficulties associated with image registration and mapping.  Two candiate dual-luminophor (pressure-temperature) coatings have already been developed by AeroChem- -both showing good emission band separation and measurement characteristics for atmospheric and sub-atmospheric pressure measurements with temperatures ranging between 80 and 150 F (a temperature range surpassing the variation specified in the Phase I RFP).",

Kolb, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG02-98ER82520\nAmount:  $75,000\n\nThe Department of Energy (DOE) needs sensor and measurement devices to determine the limits of the ability of terrestrial plants to take up carbon from the atmosphere by enhanced photosynthesis and growth.  This project will  incorporate a patented solar-induced Plant Fluorescence Sensor (PFS) with a sophisticated canopy-level radiation transfer model to interpret the sensor data.  The PFS instrument will measure absolute plant fluorescence intensities at 690 and 760 nm (corresponding to the two major chlorophyll fluorescence bands) at a range of 100 meters.  The work will focus on establishing a strong correlation between plant fluorescence levels and carbon sequestration rates.  The studies will involve a series of greenhouse-based validation experiments as well as preliminary development of the canopy radiation transfer model.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   There are three primary commercial applications for the Plant Fluorescence Sensor in the civilian market:  precision farming; wide area mapping of crop and forest health; and shallow water monitoring of phytoplankton.  The biological research community is also in need of a passive plant fluorescence sensor capable of canopy level measurements.\n\n_",

Recent research into the sensitivity-equation approach has demonstrated the ability to efficiently predict flow tendencies and determine stability derivatives in the framework of a high-order aerodynamic optimization.  The procedure numerically solves linear partial differential equations for the sensitivities themselves instead of differentiating the discretized fluid-dynamic equations.  However, to date, no commercial software is available which solves these valuable and insightful equations for viscous, compressible, chemically reacting flow.We propose a stand-alone software package that solves the sensitivity equations with direct application to analysis of unconventional aircraft.

As a result, the added complexity of these reagents and their incorporation into the detection system has resulted in designs that are difficult to implement or that require significant sample preparation steps before introduction into the detection instrument.  While increasing signal, these labels also increase noise, can negatively impact on specificity and overall in the signal-to-noise ratio.  In short, the need for reagents by current systems has created significant obstacles to fielding a truly portable, reliable and easy to use biosensor, i.e., one that can be used by the warfighter without significant training or preparation.

The superior properties of this resin result from a novel, hybrid cyanate multifunctional curing agent, causing the cured resin to have exceptionally high cross-link density. The resins are also low cost and easily processable using conventional manufacturing equipment.",

Potential causes for these kills include groundwater contamination from domestic wastes, industrial effluents, or large rain events, all of which decrease dissolved oxygen (DO), the primary gas necessary for life in aquatic organisms.  Given continuous monitoring, biologists could be alerted to low DO concentrations and potentially prevent a kill.  However, continuous monitoring by personnel is not practical because of staffing and equipment constraints.  Instruments currently available to measure DO fail in that they utilize a membrane that rapidly fouls and must be replaced to maintain accurate readings.  This project will develop an autonomous, fiber optic environmental monitoring system that will improve the efficiency and method of data transport to monitor groundwater and aquaculture systems.  The system will use sensing technology that is under development at the Fiber & Electro Optics Research Center (FEORC) at Virginia Tech.  The main goal of Phase I will be to develop a non-fouling DO sensor in a closed aquaculture system.  A secondary goal will be to demonstrate an autonomous bench-top support system that can alert personnel to abnormal water quality conditions.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  This technology could be used to continuously monitor: 1) aquaculture production, 2) water quality for endangered species, 3) water quality above and below factory effluent points, 4) water quality in remote areas that are inaccessible for daily/weekly/monthly sampling, and 5) compliance with EPA guidelines.  Additionally, fully developed applications of this research could be used to control/regulate discharge: 1) at wastewater treatment facilities, 2) at factories and processing plants, 3) on farms, and 4) at power plants cooling water discharge points._",

        "abstract": "Current DoD sensor systems employ mechanical bearings in their gimbals to provide slow scan functionality.  Mechanical bearings inherently possess a finite life and commonly suffer decreased reliability due to mechanical wear, excessive vibration and inadequate lubrication.  The vacuum and temperature extremes of space provide significant technical challenges to these devices in life and pointing accuracy requirements due to stiction and non-repeatable runouts.  Furthermore, they are completely unable to provide any vibration isolation to sensitive payloads.Recent advances in electromagnetic suspension and drive technology clearly lend themselves to application for significant improvement in gimbal mounting, promising greater gimbal life, lower weight and power, fault tolerance and vibration isolation.  In particular, Airex Corporation, in a previous Phase I effort, has recently demonstrated the viability of two axis pointing using an electromagnetic suspension and integral motor bearing technology.  Further, Airex has shown that integral motor-bearings, which use a single electromagnetic actuator to perform both the bearing and rotary pointing (motoring) functions, point the way to new gimbals that are highly reliable, low power, lubricant free, and long life.  Such functional sophistication from a novel technology can expand performance in space-borne platforms from commercial or military spacecraft in communications, pointing or optical links.",

The feasibility of several innovative beamformer and aperture approaches will be investigated and compared with existing designs.

The ability of X-rays to penetrate deep in to matter allows investigation of interior components with possibility of real-time dynamic studies. However, while significant advances have been made in X-ray sources as well as image processing steps, the X-ray detectors remain a limiting step in many of applications Important requirements for the X-ray detectors used in such applications include large area (z 20 cm x 20 cm), high resolution (100-200 1lm), wide dynamic range (104), high sensitivity, and low cost. Ability to provide real-time images is an additional requirement in some applications.  To address this, we propose to develop a solid state, large area, high resolution imaging detector by combining the semiconductor film (lead iodide, PbI2) technology being developed at RMD with the large format amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) readout technology which has been developed by our collaborators at OIS in Troy, Michigan. The detectors are expected to be useful in both static as well dynamic (or real-time) X-ray imaging applications and thus will have far reaching utility in advancing X-ray imaging.",

Alpha Omega Electromagnetics (AOE) will conduct a systematic and rigorous EM-simulation based investigation of array effects (including the use of WAIMs) on the polarization of radiating elements.  This information will then be applied to the design of AOE's proposed dual-polarized high-cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) radiating element candidates.  AOE wil employ proprietary finite element and moment method electromagnetic simulation software to accurately predict the element's scanning and polarization performance.  This state-of-the-art software has been extensively validated and has led to numerous advanced technology radar aperture designs over the past decade.  In Phase I, AOE will evaluate the viability of it's proposed radiating element configurations as solutions to the hgh XPD wide-scanning radiating element problem.

In the first component of this program, we will design, implement and demonstrate a sequence of increasingly sophisticated SAR/FLIR fusion systems, each tuned to maximize the joint benefit of these complementary sensing modes for a different level of algorithm complexity.  The point of departure is a baseline SAR/FLIR fusion system that can be implemented with ATR techniques ready today, and which provides a performance level against which enhancements can be judged.  The enhancements then considered involved SAR-assisted pose estimation, feature-level fusion and feedback strategies for FLIR-directed enhanced SAR processing.  In the second, dual component of our proposed program, we will develop analysis tools to assess quantitatively the benefits of different levels of fusion and to predict theoretically the value of various potential sensor enhancements.  The evolutionary nature of our overall proposed approach increases its short-term probability of success, and the steps we have already taken in this proposal to investigate a first-level enhanced fusion concept lead us to believe we will make a significant contribution to SAR/FLIR fusion technology in Phase I.",

We have designed our program to build upon the work done under AFRL's Theater-wide Reference Information Management (TRIM) program.  While TRIM has analyzed the accuracy of multi-source fusion for point features as a function of reference-system errors, a key assumption has been that the feature-correlation problem can be solved perfectly.  We relax this assumption by replacing the idealized perfect correlator with a multi-source feature-matching image stages:  (i) a geo-coding stage, through which reference-system errors propagate to yield geo-coding error, and (ii) an image-registration stage, through which geo-coding errors propagate to yield overall system errors.  Because TRIM has already quantified the first-stage performance, we focus on quantifying the second-stage performance and on combining the performance.  By this means, we assess current georegistration capabilities and identify potential enhancements to reference-system technology that could produce significant gains to fusion performance.",

        "abstract": "The prodigious amount of information provided by surveillance systems and other information sources has created unprecedented opportunities for achieving situation awareness.  However, due to the fact that Air Force missions are constantly evolving and specific user information needs are not predictable in advance, it is necessary to devise fusion control strategies that are adaptive to user needs and the context of each mission.  However, the optimal control problem arising from the desired adaptive control capabilities is enormously complex.  We propose to develop a methodology, called Neuro-Dynamic Programming, that combines elements of dynamic programming, simulation-based reinforcement learning, and statistical inference techniques to address the complex adaptive fusion control problem.  The principal advantage of the Neuro-Dynamic Programming methodology is that the cost-to-go function that drives the optimal control strategy is not required to be computed analytically.  Rather, the system learns the cost-to-go function via simulation-based reinforcement learning.  In related work, Neuro-Dynamic Programming controllers have been shown to provide near-optimal control of complex systems with modest amounts of simulation-based training.  Extending Neuro-Dynamic Programming for adaptive fusion control holds the promise of providing fusion capabilities that are responsive to user needs and sensitive to context dependencies of the performance of underlying fusion processes.",

This problem is important because of the need to maintain precise situational awareness of the battlespace given limited assets of different types/capabilities.  Developing, analyzing, and comparing multiple strategies is difficult because of the large number of strategy dependent variables and the overwhelming complexity of the collection planning problem.  To optimize strategy selection, we cast the collection planning problem as a grid-based network program and extend that formulation to include strategic variables (e.g., bed down locations, number/type of assets) and additional restrictions (e.g., threat zones).  Solving this network program will provide important strategic direction concerning the optimal mix of assets, optimal bed down locations, and sensitivity to problem parameters such as threat zones; as well as provide a rapid estimate of the expected collection performance.  Phase I will demonstrate a methodology for optimizing strategy selection based upon large-scale combinatorial optimization.  We will implement a capability to view multiple strategies including tradeoffs of strategic variables with a graphical display of the results.  Phase II will implement a more comprehensive solution methodology and develop a plan for insertion into theater-level collection management systems.",

Permeable reactive barriers that surround a contaminated site are useful.  However, costs for these barriers are high because of the high cost of adsorbents.  Low cost adsorbents are needed to realize the full potential of reactive barriers.  Low cost activated carbon (LCA), derived from wastes, has been identified as both effective and low cost.  It is estimated that LCAC would be 45% lower in cost than commercial activated carbons.  LCAC is a granulated activated carbon capable of adsorbing radionuclide and heavy metals in addition to a broad range of organic pollutants from water.  A proprietary chemical surface treatment will be used to enhance LCAC adsorption of hydrocarbons and toxic metals from groundwater.  Activated carbon with this surface treatment has shown excellent resistance to both leaching and carbonate fouling, important attributes for barrier applications.  The objective of this project is to show the technical and economic feasibility of preparing the special adsorbent for use in reactive barrier configurations.  Phase I will prepare the material and test its adsorption capability in a simulated barrier configuration.  An economic analysis on material production will be combined with performance test data to show the technical and economic feasibility of the product.  In Phase II, a reactive barrier for soils will be prepared and tested. \n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   The multi-layer permeable reactive barrier should provide a flexible and cost effective in-situ ground water remediation technology for contaminated sites.  Tens of millions of pounds of this material could be produced each year.  Due to the estimated 45% lower cost for this material, cleanup costs would be reduced substantially._",

        "abstract": "Bioconversion of lignocellulosic wastes to fuels and chemicals requires pretreatment to enhance conversion and reduce overall costs. Texas A&M University (TAMU) has tested a lime pretreatment process that is effective and low-cost. A significant element of the pretreatment cost is the lime regeneration system. To reduce costs, Altex has identified the Low Cost Lime Regenerator (LCLR). The LCLR is more compact, less costly and more efficient than conventional regeneration systems. Based on equipment supplier inputs, the LCLR can reduce lime regeneration costs by 55 percent. Under the Phase II program, TAMU and Altex will work together to demonstrate the lime pretreatment and LCLR lime regeneration concepts in a 2 TPD test system. Also, with input from equipment suppliers, full-scale system designs and capital and operating costs will be refined. System performance and costs will then be compared to those for conventional systems. This will show the benefits of the biomass lime pretreatment and LCLR approaches over existing method.",

The stove provides 2,000 Btu/hr heating capacity, weighs less than 2 ounces and is projected to cost $3.00.  The stove can be used by soldiers to heat water.  Also, the concept can be applied to other small heat driven military devices.  Under the Phase I feasibility effort, a proof-of principle stove will be fabricated and tested to demonstrate performance, safety, operation and reliability.  The stove will be instrumented with thermocouples and gas emission monitors.  Heating performance, emissions, safety and durability will be assessed from test results.  At the completion of tests, a burner cost estimate will be prepared with the help of manufacturers.  This information, plus fuel costs, will be used to determine the cost of heat produced by the stove.  Both performance and cost data will then be compared with fuel bar information, to determine the Benefits of the LCPS versus prior heating methods.",

        "abstract": "Amain has developed and proposes a new electronic camera technology that digitally captures and converts at the pixel level.  The approach, MOSAD,Multiplexed OverSample Analog to digital conversion  is based on well proven oversample analog to digital conversion, A/D, processes.  Oversample A/D at the pixel is accomplished using charge transfers, eliminating the need for precision or trimmed components to achieve high accuracy. Readout noise is filtered out to such an extent that transistor buffering at the pixel is not required as with active pixel sensors, APS.  A randomly accessed monolithic silicon visible light digital sensor array can be built with pixel sizes smaller than 16 microns using low cost 1.2 micron charge well technology.  A fill factor of better than 60% is also achieved without microlenses.  MOSAD provides a sensing and conversion process that is inherently linear, well beyond the 0.01% that has been reported with other approaches.  One of the benefits of this new approach is that the entire process of detection and conversion is contained in a simple monolithic chip.  The effort  involved will be to design and develop the sensor.",

This project proposes an innovative multi-agent distributed intelligent control methodology by integrating planning and decision making, soft computation, autonomous control and discrete event control techniques. The proposed intelligent system is organized by the distributed control functions in a hierarchical architecture that makes those functions relatively autonomous by introducing enough coordination and supervision to ensure the harmony of the distributed controllers necessary for high performance.

In Phase I, the detailed methodology, computation approaches and architectural concepts to support design and implementation of generic distributed multi-agent control systems are developed, and the applicability to the intelligent digital battlefield is illustrated. In Phase II, a fully integrated design and prototyping environment to support multi-agent control applications will be developed.

The availability of lightweight, permeation-selective barrier membranes would constitute an advantage to military personnel by reducing the buildup of moisture within the suit.  The development of elastomeric barrier materials would reduce the need for extensive stocks of protective ensembles to fit military personnel.  To meet this need, American Research Corporation of Virginia suggests the modification of recently developed mesoporous materials providing up to 900m 2/g surface area-to-weight ratios to provide effective barriers to chemical and biological agents and incorporation of these materials within an elastomeric matrix.  The proposal is innovative in combining a novel method of functionalizing mesoporous materials with a sorbent polymer modified elastomeric matrix.  Phase I objectives include evaluation of polymeric materials suitable for use in modifying elastomeric polymers and mesoporous materials, fabrication of perm-selective composite membranes for G and H agent analogs and microbial materials, and test of coated membranes under laboratory conditions.

Coasts of applying these coatings have increased with increasing concerns about the health and environmental effects of hexavalent chromium.  American Research Corporation of Virginia has worked to extend a trivalent chromium conversion coating (tccc) process to approach the corrosion resistance imparted by chromate conversion coatings without the health and environmental effects of hexavalent chromium.  Optimal compositions of the tccc were found to be more effective in protecting 7000 series aluminum alloys that 2000 series and performed better when immersion coated that spray coated.  To develop coatings more suited to Air Force needs, this proposal suggests the use of  solid-solution film-forming compounds to modify tccc solutions to provide large area protection for series 2000 aluminum alloys.  This program is innovative in combining film-forming materials known to achieve high levels of aluminum alloy protection with a proven tccc approach.

The majority of deployed systems have frequencies (400 MHz-30 GHz) which, in most cases, cannot penetrate the soil to the depth required for detection of buried mines and unexploded ordnance. Lower frequencies are required for penetration of the ground. However, in the lower parts of the frequency spectrum, the techniques and waveforms currently used to achieve SAR across-track range resolution, such as pulse compression or impulse waveforms, create major sources of wide-band interference to other systems when the radar is transmitting. Conversely, all other emitters operating in these crowded frequency bands cause significant levels of interference to the SAR radar receiver.  Amelex proposes to investigate new SAR system components and waveforms to generate an RF signal with sufficiently low frequwency to penetrate the ground and with the ability to achieve the across-track resolution required while reducing the EMI on both transmit and receive.",

It is known that the radar scattering from jet aircraft can have a significant engine contribution.  Current numerical techniques to predict the jet engine scattering do not yet provide the desired accuracy.  As an alternate approach to numerical prediction, a measurement technique is proposed.Analytic Designs, Incorporated (ADI) will develop a novel near-field measurement technique to provide the plane wave scattering characterization for an engine configuration.  This technique will utilize time domain measurements to collect the necessary broad frequency domain information.  Transmit and receive probes will be positionally controlled through a specially designed polar scanner designed to facilitate the data acquisition.  Unique signal processing techniques will also be employed to minimize the measured samples, thus reducing the acquisition time as well.  Once the complete, bistatic aperture distribution has been obtained, any far-field, bistatic plane wave scattering coefficient can be obtained.  The commercial ability to perform near-field, bistatic scanning would result in a unique and advanced capability to determine the scattering characteristics of other structures which can not be detached and measured with a traditional compact range approach.

HTS magnet wire applications will typically operate under fluctuating magnetic field conditions where inductive losses can dissipate significant energy at operating current levels that are well below the zero field DC critical current of the superconductor. A resistive barrier layer that electrically isolates the filaments is essential to reduce these losses. But this layer also limits oxygen exchange with the external gas environment during reactions that form the superconductor. To solve this critical problem, a concept is proposed for controlling oxygen activity inside the HTS filament by a novel sheath material, without the need for oxygen exchange with an external gas environment during superconducting oxide formation. The Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating Bi2223 composites with oxygen activity control provided at each filament without the need for oxygen contact with an external gas environment.",

The achievement of program goals can lead to a much sought scaleable method for producing long lengths of YBCO high-temperature superconductor wire that enables commercial development of a host of applications. The proposed process can effect commercially viable conductor that is both inexpensive to manufacture and inexpensive to operate because it maintains high current density in high magnetic fields, allowing utilization of dramatically cheaper cooling techniques in the 50 to 77K range.

        "abstract": "Slack developed a thermodynamic model to predict how AlN crystal growth would vary with system pressure.  He concluded growthrate increases proportionally to the square root of the nitrogen partial pressure.  Thus he predict that increasing the pressure by a factor of 100 would increase the growthrate by a factor of 10.  However, to date, the effect of the pressure on the growthrate has not been experimentally determined. A counter argument can be made that the growthrate should increase by reducing the pressure. Slack based his arguments on the supposition that the process is in equilibrium, but more realistically, the growthrate is limited by either the kinetics of sublimation (at the AlN powder source) or condensation (at the seed crystal) and mass transport between the source and seed.  If the condensation rate is rapid and nearly irreversible, the AlN growthrate will be limited by the sublimation process.  The sublimation process is analogous to evaporation, for which it has been established that the evaporation rate is directly proportional to the pressure above the melt.  Thus, the evaporation rate is enhanced with a reduction in the system pressure.  Furthermore, mass transfer rates are increased as the pressure is reduced since gas phase diffusion coefficients are directly proportional to the pressure.  High pressures may in fact be detrimental to crystal growth, as gas-phase convection increases with pressure, and convection can lead to nonuniform growthrates of the crystal.  In the analogous SiC bulk crystal growth technique, the crystal growthrate does indeed increase as the system pressure is reduced.  Because the sublimation - recondensation crystal processes are similar for both AlN and SiC, it is reasonable to assume that AlN crystal growthrate also increases with a decrease in pressure.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this effort is to develop a neural network-based aerodynamic prediction model of an existing weapon systems and integrate this model into a PC-based six degree-of-freedom (6DOF) simulation of the weapon.  Two extensive sets of wind tunnel data have been used to demonstrate the potential of using Artificial Neural Network programs as limited aerodynamic prediction codes.  The algorithm used in this preliminary work is a feed-forward, back propagation network with special techniques implemented to aid the convergence to minimum error. The wind tunnel data sets used in the present training process contained several orientation/environmental variables, several geometric variables and, of course, the normal aerodynamic coefficients as outputs.  The assessment of the accuracy of the neural network algorithm shows the predicted coefficient values to be in very good agreement with actual wind tunnel data with an average mean square error for each coefficient to be less than one part in one thousand for most of the data.  Comparison with Missile Datcom for some of the configurations clearly demonstrate the potential of developing a generic aerodynamic prediction code suitable for use in a flight simulation.",

        "abstract": "Shipboard structures employing composites typically use glass/vinyl ester (VE) manufactured with vacuum assisted RTM.  This composite system offers reduced weight, no corrosion and improved signature performance but lacks the fire performance  characteristics required for shipboard use.  Phenolic resins (PH) provide outstanding fire performance but are difficult to process and offer lower structural properties. No existing single resin system can meet all of the requirements in a given  application for Naval shipboard structures.  The co-injection resin transfer molding (CIRTM) process was developed by the  University of Delaware and the Army Research Laboratory to simultaneously inject  two (or more) resins into a dry composite preform maintaining discrete layers of  resin through the thickness of the preform.  Using CIRTM, a phenolic surface layer  may be incorporated with a vinyl ester resin in a single composite part, improving  fire performance while maintaining the cost, processing and structural advantages  of the vinyl ester. Through this program, preliminary property characterization of fire-hard CIRTM  components will be accomplished through the fabrication of 2'x2' test panels.   In addition, we will demonstrate that the benefits of the CIRTM process can be  scaled up for realistic Naval structural applications.  In Phase II a half scale  deck house will be fabricated.",

This is achieved by internal control circuitry, CMOS for low power requirements, fabricated on wafers that can be backthinned to produces less that 80 micron thick devices.

Part of this interest is due to the possible health concerns for users of personal communication and military systems.  Medical research in the use of EM radiation for such applications as treatment of tumors and microwave imaging is also receiving attention.  There is a need for a software tool that would allow for accurate simulation of the EM fields within living tissue.  Simulation techniques being used currently have severe computational limitations.  Typical problems are so large as to take either too much CPU time or require too much storage for most of today's computers.  A technique that has the potential to be effective in these types of simulation problems is the advanced finite element method used in Ansoft's High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS).  With its advanced tetrahedral meshing and adaptive refinement it should be possible to accurately simulate very complex biological test cases.  The use of this tool in simulating such test cases will be explored in this proposed Phase I projects.  The result of this work will be an efficient simulation tool for modeling EM radiation in living tissue.",

Aerosol delivery is also an important route for the transmission of naturally occurring particulate materials. The development of new technology for the efficient delivery of aerosols has important applications in agriculture, medicine, ecological science, and materials science. The physical, optical, aerodynamic, and biological properties of an aerosol are strongly linked to its particle size distribution; therefore, efficient high-output generation of monodispersed aerosols is an important capability.  The proposed program by Anvik Corporation will develop an efficient, monodispersed aerosol particle generator which will function by pulsed mechanical extrusion of high surface tension liquids through a microfabricated array of holes. The particle size distribution will be controlled by the diameters of the holes in a microfabricated nozzle array. In the fully developed system the aerosol particle size distribution can be both controlled and tuned by the separate actuation of multiple nozzle arrays with different nozzle exit hole sizes in the generator.",

        "abstract": "Feasibility of fabricating IR window materials from aluminum nitride (AlN) will  be demonstrated.  Aluminum nitride windows are sought as replacements for  sapphire windows on high speed seeker missiles because of their higher thermal  shock resistance.  Our approach is to consolidate high-purity ultrafine powders  of AlN to obtain a nanocrystalline window.  Small grain size is expected to  minimize IR scattering, and preliminary data suggest this is the case.   Theoretical estimates show that a grain size of 200 nm should yield high  thermal conductivity and IR transparency.  A novel aspect of this work is a  flame synthesis process for producing ultrafine AlN powders encapsulated in a  removable coating material to ensure that they retain their purity until  consolidation.  This sodium/halide flame and encapsulation technology is easily  scaleable and the powders produced are unagglomerated and low in oxygen.  We  will also employ a novel consolidation process that sequentially removes the  encapsulation material (sodium chloride) prior to vacuum hot pressing so that  AlN powders are never directly exposed to atmosphere.  For this program,  ultrafine AlN powders will be synthesized and consolidated into 1 mm thick  disks.  Both powder and compacts will be characterized for IR transmission,  elemental composition and crystal phases to determine the feasibility of using  such materials for infrared transparent windows.",

The proposed approach is novel  and unique, and has the ability to meet or exceed all of the AEDC's resolution and speed requirements.  The system will have the capability of providing a measurement rate of greater than 200 Hz, and measuring the model roll pitch and yaw to a resolution of better than 0.01 degrees at a distance of 8 feet.  Both the dynamic and steady surface deflections can be measured at a resolution up to 0.001 inches.  The proposed system is both reliable and versatile, and can be constructed with proven, off-the-shelf technology leading to low cost.  The proposed MAMD measurement system will be extremely valuable for flight test evaluation.  It can be used to assess model loading and model vibration.  It will also be a valuable tool in correlating the results from wind tunnel tests with the results from computational fluid dynamic models (CFD).",

The application of this device will be for an integrated replacement of chemical batteries and attitude control actuators in spacecraft.  The tasks of design, fabrication, and testing of a FES advanced rotor design for energy storage with combined attitude control system (ACS) involves many challenges.  High priority design issues are long term durability (fatigue life), dynamic stability (balance), and fail-safe operation.  Foremost, long-term durability must be adequately accommodated, failure to do so will lead to dynamic on-board disturbances (self-emitted vibrations) and non-safe operating conditions.  During an anticipated ten year service, a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) communication satellite is expected to undergo 50,000 cycles (charge/discharge) while supplying 3 to 5 kW-hr of usable energy.  The depth-of-discharge of a mechanical (flywheel) energy storage is up towards 90%.  Such a high number of cycles and depth-of-discharge presents a major concern for fatigue failure, especially due to radial stresses where the stress and strain capability of a composite material is limited.  A polar woven architecture offers radial stiffness and strength support to the rotor design compared to a uni-directional all-hoop winding architecture.",

A compact mid-IR dual wavelength source could be extremely useful for the environmental gas and pollutant sensing, such as differential absorption lidar, where the light scattering has to be evaluated and compared at two different wavelengths. Recently, we have demonstrated room-temperature optically pumped lasers from 2.9 to 4.6 um based on InAs/InGaSb/AlSb type-II quantum wells. For 4.5-1lm devices, lasing was observed up to 310 K, and the peak output power per facet was more than 3 65 W at 160 K and about 360 mW at 280 K. For type-II QC lasers, lasing was observed up to 285 K at 3.5 pm, and a peak output power of 0.5 W/facet at 3.85 ,um was obtained with 1 ps current pulses at 80 K, with a differential quantum efficiency of 131%.  The Phase I effort will be directed towards the demonstration of the CW operation of two-color light emitting diode at high temperature.",

        "abstract": "The electromagnetic directed energy method (lasers, particle beams, and high power microwaves)  of defending against  missiles relies on generating a large amount of energy at the defense site, locating the target,  and then transporting a large fraction of that energy to the target along a line of sight at the speed of light, to either destroy or destabilize the threat at as long range as possible.    Cruise and sea skimming missiles are the most difficult target to intercept at long range with line of sight weapons, such as lasers, beam weapons, and high power microwaves because of the near earth operation.    Practical concerns require a hard kill, that is obvious destruction or destabilization of the target, rather than a soft target kill in which the guidance electronics or memory may be impaired, but invisible to the defense system. This proposal addresses these problems by establishing a long range defensive perimeter through delivery of a defensive package  to a point near the path of the target missile where the defensive package then generates a repetitive, high power, ultra-wideband, electromagnetic impulse or EM-UWB.      The EM generation package can be delivered to the target via inexpensive missile, projectile, or via a UAV.   This approach can be termed electro-magnetic flak or EM-Flak and greatly reduces the difficulties in targeting, and in covering a large defensive perimeter and can serve as the first line of defense.     These PROPRIETARY,  compact Marx circuits can also be installed permanently to form a long range EM-Flak fence around military installations.  Therefore, this proposal defines a PROPRIETARY, innovative,  compact, relatively inexpensive embodiment of a Marx circuit that has the power to deliver several hundred megawatts of impulse power at tens of kilohertz pulse rate.   The same Marx unit can be used as a defensive weapon on fighter aircraft,  a jammer on UAV or as the pollution treatment source of corona in modern automobiles.",

From a map the grower will click on icons for individual sensors or groups of sensors to see both real-time values and historical data. Sensors available to the network will include soil moisture, temperature, resistivity, and local weather station data. Under the Phase I SBIR an improved soil moisture sensor (SMRT Probe) as a key element of the monitoring system was designed and built, and a web browser based data acquisition system for the SMRT Probe was used to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept. Additional sensors, such as a nitrate-nitrogen sensor and pH will be investigated to be added to the system. Using this information the grower can monitor fluctuations in soil moisture as they correlate with weather conditions to make more informed irrigation decisions and maximize the efficiency of the water used.",

The key features of our approach are (1) a low-level interface to a distributed network infrastructure consisting of an integrated real-time and fault-tolerant extension to CORBA patterned after existing and emerging CORBA standards and implemented using research and industry prototypes (i.e., Electra, TAO, and Orbix+Isis), (2) a higher-level interface built on this infrastructure and adapted to the requirements of combat systems (i.e., Aegis and CEC), (3) component-based archetypes of key reusable software objects (i.e., timed event channels), and (4) semi-automatic migration techniques for CMS-2 and ADA legacy systems, in terms of both reengineering using CORBA wrapping techniques as well as direct translation. In Phase I of this research we will investigate the feasibility of the above approach and its alternatives, leading to a well-defined high-level interface, the definition of several key component-based archetypes, and the design of an integrated real-time and fault-tolerant infrastructure leveraging existing implementation vehicles. In particular we will address the role of Java in real-time CORBA-based systems, and the use of component-based models both in design as well as in migration of legacy systems. The use of distributed object technology such as CORBA is, we posit, vital to any approach for developing a middleware supporting interoperability, and nascent lightweight CORBA extensions, while still unintegrated and low level, have great potential. Our efforts seek to fill the gaps posed by these currently missing vital technologies, and will significantly advance the realization of a high-level open architecture for combat systems.",

Multiple weapon effects codes are utilized which operate at differing levels of fidelity and focus on differing aspects of the overall problem.  Each code in turn has unique target model and interrogation needs.  The target models are difficult to create directly and existing target model generators fall short of meeting  the needs of these multiple codes.  The proposed Smart Target Modeling Tool would provide a superset of target data to man disparate analyses.  It would allow users to quickly generate targets for a limited set of building types suing engineering and architectural rules.  Users would be able to graphically modify the target from the user interface.  A layered approach is proposed which would allow differing methodologies to receive only data that it needs.  Target data might include geometry, component properties, component connectivity, venting, room definition, plumbing, and electrical wiring.This Phase I effort will define a standard for ground-fixed target model representations.  Requirements for the Smart Target Modeling Tool, as well as user interface and data design will be formulated.

        "abstract": "In complex command and control architectures, warfighters must clearly understand the impact of information flow on information management and decision-making processes.  To cope with rapidly changing mission environments, complex, information-rich theater warfare systems must adapt their information structure (who should know what, and when) to survive and dominate the battlespace.  The Information Flow and Analysis tools we plan to develop to support the analysis and design of human-system adaptive architectures are intended for both the commander and the designer.  Our focus is on tool enhancement rather than tool building and on model integration rather than model development.  Our human-centered approach, based on a blend of proven system modeling techniques combined with an existing set of C2 visualization and simulation tools, provides a low-risk, high-payoff solution with a short development cycle allowing computer-based modeling tools to be rapidly placed in the hands of the commanders and the designers of theater warfare systems.  Aptima and its team partners for this project, Klien Associates and Micro Analysis and Design, have the collective experience to demonstrate the prototype of such a tool in Phase I, and deliver the complete set of Information Flow and Analysis Tools in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Historically, more fatalities and serious injuries occur from Army ground vehicle mishaps than from combat operations.  Training, contingency, and combat operating tempo makes a significant number of vehicular mishaps with fatalities and serious injuries inevitable. Effective occupant crash protection, absent in Army tactical vehicles, would reduce this toll.  Operations introduce significant hazards not seen in civilan use:  vertical forces from land mine blasts, roll overs and       downs.                                                                tered in conventional automotive design.  ARCCA can develop cost-effective seating and restraint systems that mitigate vertical hazards and are compatible with, and may even enhance, protection from frontal crashes.  Our approach mirrors the Army's risk management.  We will review selected Army mishaps to collect and analyze data.  Using computer simulation and limited physical testing, we will analyze cost-effective ways to minimize the hazards.  Applying our knowledge of aviation and emerging civilian automobile technology,  we will explore feasible means of injury reduction that is compatible with the vehicle and its mission.  We will establish requirements for solutions and analyze their feasibility.  This will result in a requirements statement, proof of concept/prototype for in-depth analysis and testing in Phase II, and a testing methodology.  BENEFITS:  The results of our HMMWV research and development effort will apply to the entire Army vehicle fleet, new development, and the fast growing civilian and government off road sport utility fleets.  The anticipated benefits are a substantial reduction in serious injuries and death from vertical force induced hazards, using solutions that can easily and cost-effectively retrofit into existing vehicles and designed into new vehicles.",

        "abstract": "Superior information over one's adversary allows control of the battlespace, and ultimately provides opportunities to tales advantage of me adversary's vulnerability.  C4I planning is critical to shape and control the pace and phasing of battlespace engagements, and requires direct access to battlespace information in order to utilize it effectively.  Effective C4I planning requires the ability to seek out relevant information sources; connect them into the plan where their information flow contributes; monitor the information flow to determine changes to the battlespace; and reacting to those changes.     In Phase I, an Agent-Based Planning, Execution, and Monitoring Architecture will be designed that provides dynamic, distributed, and interleaved planning and execution across C4I systems.  Our goal is not to recreate planning technology, but to extend it with plan execution and monitoring techniques.  In our approach informational-need is used to plan out high level goals, and then configure feedback-control, data-flow networks from information sources to those goals.  During execution, data-flows are monitored and the plan network is reconfigured as the battlespace changes or as goals are achieved/failed.  Thus, the data-flow provides feedback control to react to small permutations in the battlespace, and the data-flow monitoring provides reaction and replanning-triggers to large permutations.",

        "abstract": "Current methods of software deployment for shipboard computing assets are slow and exceedingly expensive.  In the past, the lack of low-cost, global, high-bandwidth digital communications mandated the manual transportation of physical media to individual ships. With the emergence of the Global Broadcast Service (GBS), there is an opportunity to realize substantial cost savings by automating the software-distribution process while significantly reducing deployment time.  This proposal suggests a secure, efficient system for end-to-end software distribution between a land-based software support agency and shipboard computing assets using GBS; this system is known as the satellite IP-based high-bandwidth software distribution system (SIPHON).",

Phase I includes the determination of sample flow characteristics through the hollow waveguide, the identification and demonstration of a capability to perforate the waveguide to provide adequate sample flow and response time, and the design of a complete sensor that will lead to the construction in Phase II of a prototype capable of measuring pollutant concentrations at the parts-per-billion level.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   If successful, the resulting sensor could revolutionize pollution monitoring methods.

        "abstract": "Alex (nanosize aluminum) powder is being considered by several U. S. Navy groups as a propellant additive because it markedly increases combustion rate.  Extrapolating equations for single particle combustion of aluminum shows the particle life of a 100 nanometer particle to be about 40 nanoseconds.  Its small particle produces oxide that would minimize being accumulated on engine parts.  Alex's rapid reaction with water also suggests its use for aluminum-sea water propulsion schemes.   Alex's combustion would be enhanced by its metastable structure that provides energy in the form of a heat burst that occurs at about 400 C, causing a transformation in crystal morphology.  Hydroxylamine nitrate (HAN) is a monopropellant that has been considered by the Navy as an Otto Fuel II replacement.  We propose a cooperative study to support NUWC-Newport by providing samples of improved Alex compatible with stabilized HAN. We would coat Alex particles with organics that would provide increased energy over oxide passivated nano-aluminum, while shielding the aluminum from premature reaction with oxidizers such as HAN during storage.  Using coated particles we would determine the feasibility of producing stable HAN-based gels.  We would also develop aluminized jet fuels for potential bi-propellant systems.",

The system relies on 10-20 Mbps RF communications within a 100 m diameter cell size. The cells are interconnected with 622, Mbps optical crosslinks. The critical technology in making these cross links feasible with low installation cost is that they be self-aligning. In this Phase I SBIR we will demonstrate that we can design and build a self-aligning, reliable, all weather 100 m optical crosslink at low cost. In order to make the links self-aligning we will use a high peak power, low duty cycle infrared pulsed diode laser for a beacon signal. The detection will be performed with a simple quad cell tracker. Investigations of the optimal scanning algorithms will be performed. In addition, since the beacon laser is pulsed, range information for each base station node can be determined. We will investigate using this information along with encoder angle pointing information to permit very rapid alignment of new base station nodes into an existing mesh of base stations.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this research is to investigate the use of photon-counting avalanche photodiodes as a laser communication sensor. This detector technology allows reduction of the received optical power. The system will also incorporate a cesium atomic line filter to eliminate background light and a wavelength locked communication laser matched to the atomic line filter. This configuration will enable use of the extremely high gain of photon-counting avalanche photodiodes by reducing noise generated by background light. Conventional avalanche photodiodes utilize a lower gain and higher signal levels to provide an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio.  The proposed detector will also require an innovative signal processing system to recover the received data. The photon-counting APD will output a pulse if a single photon is detected, if multiple photons are detected, or if a dark count event occurs, when no photons were detected. For this reason, the signal pulse will need to be divided into                                                 mined by how many bins contained detected photons. By contrast, conventional APDs have an analog output signal, and the decision process is based on the relative level of the output signal.  This design is expected to produce an additional 12 dB of sensitivity over conventional avalanche photodiode technologies.",

The next generation of missile systems will have a high DSP content, undoubtedly based on cell-based integrated circuits (CBICs) along with an integrating electronic design automation (EDA) environment. DSP CBICs can range from complex standard cell objects to narrowly focused FPGA macros. The EDA environment will consist of a highly integrated collection of CBIC. IC integration, and board level design and verification tools. The proposed study will provide the Army with a state-of-the-art analysis of this field, plus identify and exploit several new opportunities such as David, an innovative, fast, compact, MAC-centric CBIC technology with built-in testing logic.  David will be shown to have the ability to bypass an entire generation of DSP cores. Included in the software integration study will be best-of-breed EDA systems, behavioral level synthesis tools which create a new bridge from VHDL processor to board-level system design activities, an evaluation of the impact of very long instruction word (VLIW) architecture on missile signal processing, and the rigorous and accurate design and simulation of important missile-seeking DSP applications.

Our approach to object level change detection is a multi-stage and modular processing architecture.  The general architecture is similar to the SAIP OLCD architecture (developed by AAEC) with the exception that we are adding (1) stronger emphasis on feature-based change detection, (2) a second layer of verification for missing and new objects, and (3) a model-based processing paradigm.

The Army Enterprise Implementation Plan, Task 9 Action Plan, specifies the use of Department of Defense (DoD)-compliant tools and methodologies--including the High-Level Architecture (HLA)--to oversee the prioritization and integration of C4I models to facilitate trade-off analysis and validation of the Operational, Technical, and Systems Architectures. The overarching objective of the proposed Phase I work effort is to develop a plan to transition current Army C41 M&S products and tools to an objective M&S environment that meets the criteria established by the Army Enterprise Strategy Task 9 M&S Subgroup. HLA lends itself well to meeting the requirements of the Objective C4I M&S environment. The HLA goal is to meet the wide range of functional M&S applications while facilitating interoperability among simulations and reusability of simulations and their components.

Severe problems arise when the band-of-interest contains a large number of signals of different amplitudes and types of modulation; the difficulties are compounded if the signals are pulses of relatively short duration.  Most of the threat parameters used for sorting can now be changed on a pulse-by-pulse basis and the frequency of a signal may even be shifted or spread within a pulse.  This Phase I effort addresses the development of a receiver which has an enhanced capability for measuring the frequency in high signal density environments in addition to the other key parameters (PW, PRI, and potentially AOA) that significantly upgrade overall system performance.  Acousto-optic-based channelized receiver technology is a prime candidate for consideration.  The major advantage of threat analysis using acousto-optic Bragg diffraction is the inherent capability for wideband spectrum analysis on a real-time, wide-open basis with good frequency resolution.

Battery failure can result in more than downtime in a flight situation:  it can imperil the mission.  The common method to determine battery health was to perform load test, time-consuming physical inspection, and maintenance logs examination.  Although reliable, this method often is cumbersome, time consuming, expensive, and risky.  The development of a sensor that will calculate in real time the short-term usability (amp-hour rating) as well as the long-term end-of-life reliability of the battery will greatly reduce maintenance costs and can reduce the possibility of a failure in a life-critical situation.  The calculation of end-of-life prediction will require advancements in neural network software to linearize a highly non-linear function.  Aurora proposes to develop a battery sensor that will calculate reliability in real time.  The objective is to apply neural network prediction software in development and demonstrate an operational sensor.  Using information about the battery's operational condition the sensor will calculate the battery's state of charge, current amp-hour rating (stationary hangar conditions), project amp-hour rating (under flight conditions), and predict the time of the battery's end of life.",

        "abstract": "In order to assist the Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) operator in performing timely damage estimates for physical and functional damage assessment, Aurora Simulation Inc. proposes to develop an Automatic Battle Damage Prediction System (ABDPS), which will have the following features:  ABDPS will not only predict physical damage and functional damage independently, but will also predict the coupling of physical damage and functional damage. The terms of the functional damage model and the Electronic Warfare (EW) Model will be used interchangeably. For the EW models this study will concentrate on the Radar Detection Model and Electronic Counter Measure (ECM) Model. Since the outcome of a battle will be dependent on both the probability of kill (physical damage model) and the probability of detection (EW model). Therefore these models need to be coupled to provide accurate battle damage predictions.  The system will be 100% compatible with different computer platforms (PC, workstation, super computer) and operating systems (Windows 95, NT, Unix, VMS, etc). Since the system will be an object-oriented software, the maintenance costs of the software will be low, and the models can be replaced in a plug-and-play style.  BENEFITS:  The proposed work will integrate the existing physical and functional damage models into one automated system, so the battle damage prediction will become an automatic, timely, and accurate operation. The technology of the system would be applicable to generating physical damage estimates for any type of natural or man-made destruction, as well as, functional damage associated with the physical damage for which predictive models exist. The ABDPS will not only benefit the BDA operator; it will also enhance mission planning, training, and weapon system evaluation",

        "abstract": "Soldiers using the ABCS systems do not have on-line access to doctrinal publications and context sensitive tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPS) to aid them in their mission planning process.  These TTPs should support the users current task by retrieving information based on the force affiliation and situation.  Doctrine, missions, policies, and strategies are some of the considerations in generating these mission and task specific TTPS.  The focus of this effort is to address the knowledge representation and user interface requirements for storing, retrieving, and synthesizing information based on a specific task for a given force.  Considerations during the storage, retrieval, and synthesis of the information are the force affiliation and situation.  The TTPs generated support, tactical, peacekeeping, and/or humanitarian operations.  This Phase I proposal offers an excellent opportunity to focus on how knowledge-based TTPs can be extracted from a wide variety of sources stored and presented to the user in the military decision-making process (MDMP).  These knowledge-based tools enable the user to manipulate data and information by displaying, entering, storing, exchanging, and processing data, information, knowledge, and experience.  The storyboards are developed using computer-based training authorware technology and integrate office automation technology.  BENEFITS:  The research done in Phase I benefits U.S. Army systems by providing a knowledge representation and screen designs for tools that integrate doctrine, strategy, and experience into the mission planning process.  In addition, AIS plans to actively pursue this representation in it's commercial Java-based C3I applications (WebC3I) product line which in turn will become available in other military systems that use this product.",

The C2 architecture of tomorrow needs to be more diverse, providing for distributed objects to interact with many plug-and play applications. Each platform should be capable of being dynamically configured to run applications specific to tbe task being accomplished by the soldier.  The ultimate goal of the C2 architecture environment is to develop an architecture capable of running heirarch of intelligent agents that work cooperatively with the many diverse applications needed by soldiers to complete all of their C2 tasks.  The architecture is flexible enough to handle current system requirements and the technology enhancements of the future.  There are two essential distributed object-oriented technoligies that will make this architecture possible: CORBA and Java.  CORBA provides the mechanism for accessing distributed objects and invoking their behaviors from multiple cooperating agents.  Java provides new agents with a platform independent presentation of these distributed objects.  BENEFITS:  Successful completion of this effort provides a solid technical architecture for developing and delivering a robust framework where applications and data sources can interoperate in a plug-and-play environment.

This has a detrimental impact on the development of power sources for portable electronics and electric vehicles, which must be resolved before any further progress is made in these fields.  This project will develop an environmentally safe, inexpensive, high power, rechargeable lithium battery.  This approach incorporates composite vanadium-oxide xerogel particles into a solid polymer electrolyte matrix.  The resulting material will have a capacity of approximately 400 mA/g, an energy density greater than 500 Wh/kg, and the ability to cycle continuously without degradation of these properties.  In this project, submicron vanadium-oxide xerogel coated particle will be formed which will then be incorporated into a composite solid polymer electrolyte matrix.  This cathode material will then be tested to determine its capacity, energy density and ability to cycle without loss of capacity.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The implementation of this proposed technology would have uses in both commercial and military electronics, especially those for which portability is important.

Office waste paper is a significant source of high grade paper fiber for recycling, but is currently underutilized, due to the challenges of fully removing xerographic and laser printer toner. These so called *laser inks* are designed to fuse to the page during printing and tend to resist removal by conventional deinking processes. In a Phase I SBIR grant, AVEKA Inc. proposed the development of novel toners that would improve office paper deinking performance by reformulating the toner. The Phase I results indicate that toner deinking can be improved, in some cases dramatically, with this approach, which targets the active components directly to the toner-fiber interface. This *Near Field Effect* targeting improves deinking while minimizing additives already used by the recycling industry.",

AVEKA, Inc. proposes the use of their proprietary aspirator/dispersion technology in combination with a gas evaporative process in order to form a stable nanoparticle dispersion in an inert solvent.  Standard polymerization techniques will then be used to form a protective fluoropolymer coating around the aluminum nanoparticles in-situ.  After separation from the dispersion medium, a stable free-flowing nanopowder will be formed, which would be suitable for applications in energetic materials and metallurgy.",

The Army has identified a need to reduce expansion of epoxy composite materials used in experimental artillery ammunition sabots.  We propose to use our expertise in coating design, experience with application of halogenated polymer systems, and our commercially available composite primer coatings to develop a fully functional composite moisture barrier coating for the Army.  Several polymer materials, polyvinylidene chloride copolymers and polytetrafluoroethylene, are proposed as primary candidates.  This coating will. be low temperature cured, approximately 1 mil thick, compatible with propellants and depleted uranium, -46 C to 63 C service temperature and easily applied in ammunitions production facilities via high volume low pressure spray technology.  Moisture/gas barrier coating development will include defining application procedures that provide for bonding of boot material to the sabot and testing to demonstrate coating suitability.  Phase II will investigate improvement coating adhesion and demonstrate application process scale up.  Scale up shall include the spray application of the barrier coating(s) onto Government Furnished Material sabots to be used by the Army for full-scale humidity and ballistics testing.  BENEFITS:  A viable, commercially available moisture barrier coating for composites is beneficial to satellite industry, aircraft industry, and all hardware organizations that use composite materials. Weight reduction is the primary driver for the use of composites.  This type of coating will reduce weight of the copposite even further by reduction/elimination of water vapor absorption.",

        "abstract": "The implementation of composites in the aerospace industry has been limited because of the inherent unpredictability of composite structure failures.  Typically, very conservative designs are saddled with requirements for fail safe fasteners resulting in heavy and expensive structures.  Many recent designs such as F-22 began with large percentages of composite structures, but eventually became primarily metallic designs because of these considerations.  To fully realize the benefits of composites on high performance aircraft, more flaw tolerant joints must be implemented.  Z-Fiber and 3D weaving technologies represent a fundamentally new way to produce large, unitized composite structures.  Using Z-Fiber, co-cured joints can be manufactured which are inherently flaw tolerant and do not require additional fail-safe measures to be taken.  However, to date, the implementation of Z-Fiber technology has been hobbled by the current industry design criteria that were developed for 2D composites.  With the advent of the new Joint Service Structures Specification, a clear set of enabling criteria have been developed which delineate the requirements for co-cured and co-bonded structures on military aircraft.  These criteria now provide a clear path to developing the data necessary to implement Z-Fiber and other 3D technologies.  The purpose of this program is to begin the process of gathering data to demonstrate that Z-Fiber reinforcement provides a flaw and damage tolerant joint that meets the requirements of the Joint Service Structures Specification.",

        "abstract": "The focus of the program is to complete the concept design of a 1500 hp two cycle opposed piston diesel engine.  This concept shall provide a platform for component and material technology implementation and evaluation.  The program consists of three major tasks; concept design. modeling and testing.  Concept design will be based on the EOS 4.1 liter prototype.  The principals of the engine will be scaled for higher horsepower while focusing on low heat rejection. single cooling media, high power density (2hp/lb., 100 hp/ft3) and signature reduction.  Solid modeling will be utilized to evaluate engine weight and volume characteristics.  The modeling effort consist of expanding an existing zero dimensional diesel engine simulation to model the thermodynamic cycle of the opposed piston engine and predict performance.  The model will include combustion chamber and porting details while evaluating multi-loop scavenging and fuel injection timing and duration.  Testing will be conducted on the EOS 4.1 liter engine.  Initial performance characteristics will be obtained to support concept design and to provide validation of the modeling.  The success of the testing will provide a base for proof of principal and establish the risk level for the technologies being evaluated.  BENEFITS:  High power density engines and technology have commercial applications in the marine, aircraft and industrial markets.  This project will directly benefit the introduction of the EOS engine to the marine market.  This two cycle design provides two cycle power density while maintaining four cycle emission levels.  This characteristic alone provides many commercial applications",

        "abstract": "The LCAC Full-Mission Trainer (FMT) is providing a cost-effective tool for training LCAC operators in normal craft operation and casualty mode conditions.  However, the FMT was never validated with full-scale LCAC test data.  Rather, the feel of the FMT was                       uning coefficients in response to inputs obtained from experienced LCAC operators. The FMT training schedule combined with modeling limitations prevents the U.S. Navy from conducting in-house analysis on the impact of atypical LCAC missions, unusual paylod items or craft alterations, for instance.  PC-based computers and software simulation tools have now progressed to the point where physics-based time domain dynamic simulation of the LCAC is no longer limited to mainframe computers and, thus, can readily be performed on desktop computers.  PC-based programs must also be validated with actual craft data to maximize fidelity.  It is proposed, therefore, that a PC-based simulation of LCAC motions be developed and that the actual test data necessary for subsequent validation of the dynamic simulation be obtained.  The intent of the proposed Phase-I work effort is to identify the required test data and develop a test plan and data analysis plan which can be used to efficiently obtain the test data necessay for simulation verification.",

        "abstract": "Many modern systems rely on multiple innovative actuators and effectors to   improve performance, versatility, and survivability. In systems where   several actuators or actuator combinations are capable of affecting the   behavior of a single controlled varaible, an opportunity exists to   incorporate non-traditional features in the control law, including   post-failure reconfiguration and optimization of high-level system   functions (e.g., overall efficiency). Often, one requires an intelligent   nonlinear control algorithm to achieve these benefits. This proposal   describes such an algorithm based on neural network system modeling,   robust on-line system identification, and receding-horizon optimal   control. This algorithm has been evaluated favorably in piloted   simulations and F-16 flight tests (including simulated impairments), and   it is currently being applied to a tailless aircraft having over 14   independent effectors. The proposed Phase I research will (1) develop a   prototype control system design toolkit based on the algorithm, (2) extend   these algorithms with a control allocation module that provides desired   closed-loop performance while achieving higher-level mission objectives   such as reduced drag or low observability, and (3) demonstrate the   algorithms and the prototype software tool on a complex system application   of interest to the Navy.",

The problem is further exacerbated in remotely-piloted vehicles where pilots lack the physical cues that assist in self-limiting.  Recent research has developed techniques for anticipating and avoiding actuator saturation by limiting pilot commands.  While automated command-limiting prevents multivariable integrator windup, it does not change the response perceived by the pilot and may not eliminate PIO.  Recent piloted-simulation experiments conducted by the U.S. Army and BAI in the Verticle Motion Simulator at NASA Ames Laboratory, demonstrated that the combination of a computational means for anticipating limits and tactile pilot cueing via stick-force feedback or stick shaking resulted in pilots being able to accomplish difficult maneuvers more aggressively, with less pilot workload, and less time spent operating at limit conditions.  In the proposed Phase I SBIR program, BAI shall investigate the extent to which automatically-computed command limits can be fed back to the pilot via force-reflecting input devices for the mitigation of saturation-induced PIO for both piloted and remotely-piloted vehicles.",

The APA will take normal spoken English requests and perform tasks such as electronic mail, meeting coordination, and flight scheduling, and then adapt and optimize the output according to the user's preferences.  In addition, the system will take the user's selections from the output list and adjust the preferences dynamically using relevance feedback techniques.  The APA is built on an agent based architecture; a primary agent interfaces with the user, translating requests into the agent languages of KQML and KIF.  These KQML and KIF statements are sent to task-specific agents to execute the requests.  On request completion, each agent shows results in its own display, and a message is sent back to the primary agent for response in a computer generated voice.  This design allows for a scalable APA architecture.  As new tasks need to be added, a new agent is registered with the primary agent.  This modular design of the APA allows it to be extended to the control of computer based military applications including military office applications, command and control applications and embedded computer systems.",

        "abstract": "Combustion chemistry has a key role in the design of low emission and high speed propulsion.  The knowledge of the chemistry of  relevant practical fuels has reached the point where design problems can in principle be addressed from a rigorous scientific perspective.  However, the introduction of detailed chemical  reaction mechanisms into complex design computations is not practical at the present time.  Systematic reduction approaches  have found general application in the area of combustion chemistry and it has been shown that large gains in computational efficiency may be achieved.  Inevitable difficulties arise due to the numeric properties of heavily reduced mechanisms and the range of applicability of such mechanisms is often severely  curtailed.  Limitation of this type may be essentially removed through the use of in site adaptive tabulation techniques (ISAT) which permit consideration of a much larger number of species. Efficiency gains of about 1000 times, compared to the approach of direct integration of the corresponding rate equations, may be obtained.  The technique is also ideally suited for use in conjunction with transported pdf calculations of reactive turbulent flows.  The present proposal outlines the most promising route for the implementation of aviation fuel chemistry into design computations.",

For difficult-to-separate organic compounds conventional technologies have serious drawbacks, including high cost and high energy requirements.  This project will develop a new class of isoporous membranes suitable for separation of compounds with similar vapor pressures or solubilities (e.g., isomer pairs, olefins from paraffins).  These novel membranes -- composed of thin, selective isoporous ceramic coatings on temperature- and chemical-resistant microporous polymeric supports -- will separate organic compounds on the basis of size.   Phase I will demonstrate feasibility by making isoporous ceramic coatings suitable for separating small organic compounds, screening these coatings for the separation of five organic pairs, and applying the coatings to the outside surfaces of high-performance polymeric hollow-fiber supports.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  This technology could be used for a wide range of difficult separations in the chemical-process and petrochemical industries, supplanting the use of energy-intensive, expensive technologies.

The instrumented garment will be capable of monitoring the skin temperature at multiple localized torso locations using fiber-optic sensors incorporated on a single optical fiber.  The sensors are passive and will therefore require no external power.  The method for monitoring the sensors is optical in nature and so they will pose no danger in the presence of combustible materials.  The equipment for interrogating the sensors will be compact, light weight, low power, and cost effective, thus making possible a small battery powered unit that can be sewn into the garment or clipped onto the user's belt.  This system will include all of the equipment required to monitor the embedded sensors in order to determine a potential low skin temperature hazard to the user.",

This Phase I effort focuses on the design and development of simulation models for multiUCAV situations.  During the primary work phase of this effort, a limited wind-tunnel entry in the Langley Full-Scale Wind Tunnel will be performed to demonstrate the ability to measure intervehicular aerodynamics efforts.  Computational aerodynamics will serve as an additional source to determine intervehicular efforts.  Using information gained, modifications to conventional flight dynamics modeling will be postulated.  Data collected from the test and analyses will be incorporated into an existing simulation model to perform preliminary handling quality and control authority investigations.  As part of the secondary effort, knowledge gained from the limited test entry will be used to perform a detailed design of wind-tunnel test hardware and software.  In Phase II, this hardware and software will be used in an effort to perform extensive simultaneous testing of multiple UCAV configuration models.  Simulation model modifications will also be implemented into the BAR D-Six simulation environment.  UCAV test data combined with the simulation tools will provide engineers with a useful tool for the design and analysis of complex multivehicle control laws.",

        "abstract": "The Uninhabited Combat Air Vehicle (UCAV) is a new and promising multi-role and multi-mission system concept currently under development and evaluation by the armed forces. Similar to current generation of weapon systems, simulation of the UCAV mission profile will undoubtedly be an essential part of the system development process.  Further, the rapid pace of their development and the evolution of various UCAV applications stress the need for expeditious optimization of air-to-air and surface attack tactical options in realistic combat scenarios using high-fidelity yet low-cost simulators.  Advances in high-speed computer systems allow realistic simulation and assessment of many aspects of UCAV system, ranging from flight dynamics, ingress/egress profiles, sensor effectiveness, weapon tactics, and multi-vehicle coordination schemes. Furthermore, the maturity in personal computer (PC) systems makes them ideal for preliminary evaluations of UCAV systems previously addressable only by complex and expensive dome simulators.  The proposed effort will further expand the application of offeror's current six-degree of freedom high-fidelity simulation capabilities on the PC's and provide Navy the unique capability to cost-effectively simulate and test UCAV air-to-air and surface attack maneuvering tactics and control paradigms in realistic combat scenarios.  This submittal proposes to use a PC-based commercial off-the-shelf  simulation environment, D-Six, developed under Air Force SBIR by the offeror, as the basis for the development of the UCAV simulation platform. The system will be leveraged by the many embedded development, analysis and networking features, significantly reducing the time and cost required for research, testing, demonstration and evolution of a viable multi-vehicle simulation platform.",

Phase I would establish the feasibility of the experimental program, its theoretical basis, and create a prototype computer model.  The Phase II research would collect the data necessary to create a valid computer simulation of lung pressures and flows during rapid decompression.

Although anthropomorphic test devices (ATD) or manikins have been used to assess, develop and standardize ejection seat and crash safety, they do not represent the spinal response under high acceleration loading. Flex Technology has designed and developed an innovative flexible structure which has the potential to mimic the properties of the human spine for incorporation within an ATD.  It is proposed to review the current staus and properties of ATD spinal units as well as human vertebal specimens, research and document the spine's response to high impact loading, to design and develop using dynamic computer modelling an innovative flexible structure that has the stiffness properties comparable to experimentally determined vertebral stiffness, and to construct prototype units for mechanical testing and response verification.  The key elements of the proposed unit is its simplistic, continuous, one piece design, and ability to customize the mechanical properties.  The unit will be computer designed based on experimentally determined vertebral properties.  Phase II developments will include a multi-degree of freedom spinal unit, a female unit, whole body response testing and verification, and further testing in anticipation of government acceptance.

Pope, Principal Investigator\nDr. Daniel H. Pope, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG03-98ER82540\nAmount:  $73,981\n\n\nMicrobiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) is a very serious type of corrosion that often results in rapid and unexpected failure of wells, pipelines, tanks, and other equipment in oil, gas, electric generating, and chemical process industries.  Present methods of treating MIC are expensive and use toxic chemicals (biocides).  In addition, the treatment is applied to whole systems instead of targeting specific problem areas (hot spots).  Of most concern is the fact that many biocide treatments, in real-world, energy-producing facilities, do not work very well.  Previous research has demonstrated that a few film-forming amines (commonly used as corrosion inhibitors) can prevent the attachment of microbes to metal surfaces.  Phase I will identify a group of amines which prevent this attachment, understand how the chemical structures of these amines contribute to their anti-colonization action, and determine how to use them in industrial settings.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Anti-microbial/colonization chemicals would find use in almost all energy-related industries, providing protection against both microbiologically influenced corrosion and generalized corrosion.  These treatments would be much more effective and could reduce the cost of total corrosion prevention by as much as 50%.  An advantage could also be created for United States chemical manufacturers in the production and sale of such chemicals worldwide._",

        "abstract": "The U. S. Air Force has identified a need to develop small IMUs for tactical air launched weapon system applications. To this end, the Navigational and Control Branch (AFRL/MNGN) of the Advanced Guidance Division at Eglin AFB is currently sponsoring several efforts to develop innovative micro-electromechanical sensors (MEMS) and ultimately MEMS-based IMUs.  In the near term, MEMS IMUs are expected to be developed which exhibit ! mg accelerometer errors and 50-100 deg/hr gyro errors. Although the accelerometer errors are acceptable for tactical-grade systems, the gyro errors are significantly larger than those currently associated with the mature but more costly optical-gyro (i.e., RLG and FOG) IMUs.  The potentially larger gyro errors directly impact the transfer alignment requirements for a MEMS IMU equipped weapon.  For example, MEMS-specific alignment procedures and algorithms may be required not only to accurately align the IMU but also to substantially calibrate the MEMS gyros.  The focus of this proposed research, therefore, is to: (1) formulate high-fidelity MEMS IMU error models for near-term and far-term systems, (2) develop conventional and advanced transfer-alignment algorithms for the MEMS IMUs with special emphasis on gyro calibration, and (3) conduct simulation-based performance/cost tradeoff analyses to qualify the transfer-alignment and navigation accuracy for each IMU and candidate alignment algorithm.  The results of this propose research may lead to a relaxation of the MEMS gyro accuracy specification which does not sacrifice weapon system performance.",

Optimizing the air/fuel ratio of a turbocharged diesel engine at each speed and load operating point has been proven to reduce fuel consumption and exhaust emissions, particularly NOx and particulates.  The innovative technology presented in this proposal provides a Technical Abstract system for high speed closed loop air/fuel ratio trimming.  A compact, robust sensor based on fiber optic technology used in conjunction with high speed data processing and electronically controlled air management are the basis for this concept.  The feasibility of this concept will be demonstrated an a commercial heavy duty diesel engine which will be provided by the contractor, BKM, Inc.  BENEFITS:  The proposed technology will lead to the optimization of both fuel efficiency and the reduction of pollutants in military as well as commercial automotive, marine and stationary engines.  The system will allow engines to operate at peak efficiencies regardless of turbocharger matching compromises, conventional control tolerances and operating environment.",

With growout technology in hand, there is vast potential for expansion. We plan to use nucleus estate joint ventures with local farmers to drive this expansion in outer atolls. This project addresses technical, logistical, and sociological challenges with establishing and supporting operations in the remote, rural Pacific.\n\nPhase I demonstrated the efficiency of the containerized hatchery as the center for the nucleus estate. Phase II research will determine best strategies for structuring joint ventures to fit the social, cultural and legal framework of rural atoll communities. This can be a model for pearl development throughout the country, and aquaculture development throughout the region. Satellite farms, modeled on a nucleus estate framework, would receive spat from containerized hatchery operations, together with technical management, training, pearl seeding, marketing and supply services.

Such a model will provide fast and accurate predictions for the source characterization and transport of radionuclides in the near-source field and bridge the gap between source modeling and large-scale meterological predictions.  It will be interfaced with existing HPAC capability to strengthen its applicability and predictability in providing real-time information for radiological emergencies.  The code, complete with a graphical user interface, will run on computers equivalent to a Pentium PC.  The code can be used in assisting government agencies such as DoD, DoE, NASA, EPA, and their contractors in assessing potential collateral effects of nuclear hazard from facilities and weapons.  The code can also be applied by both government agencies and private industries for environmental assessment of accidentally released hazardous materials.",

        "abstract": "The proposed effort will result in the development and wind tunnel validation of a universal pitch cycloidal propeller system which can provide efficient vertical takeoff or landing (VTOL) UAV propulsion. This form of propulsion is currently in use in marine applications, and has been studied by major aircraft manufacturers and the military. Study and wind tunnel test results support the concept; however, until the advent of the micro-computer and associated motion control technologies, efficient cycloidal propellers were only feasible for relatively narrow speed ranges. This effort will capitalize on computer control to provide a universal pitch cycloidal propeller that will allow efficient flight across a wide range of flight speeds and conditions. Cycloidal propulsion provides a unique 360-degree directional flight capability through use of a low-velocity, high-volume flow technique of exceptional efficiency. The cycloidal propeller, which provides both thrust and lift, can make near instantaneous change in thrust direction without re-orientation of the propellers plane of rotation. Major advantages of this system include efficient hovering flight, low-noise signature, near-instantaneous change in thrust direction, wide speed range, safety, and packaging. BOSCH Aerospace, Inc., has teamed with the Raspet Flight Research Center of Mississippi State University to conduct Phase 1. The research will encompass systems engineering, mechanical design, computer modeling, control algorithm development, fabrication, and wind tunnel tests. A fully functional propeller and control system will be completed and tested during Phase 1. Documentation from this effort will include study, design, and tests results.",

        "abstract": "An advanced human simulation system could serve as a digital biomechanics laboratory in which simulated humans perform useful tasks under novel conditions.  It will allow us to measure loads, forces, and energy levels in humans that are difficult if not impossible to obtain any other way. It could be used to evaluate the effectiveness of clothing, footwear, equipment or movement strategies.  Rapid evaluation cycles using simulation will shorten the product development and acquisition cycle.  To test the design and effect of equipment on human performance, we must be able to simulate realistic, life-like behaviors such as running, walking, crawling, and throwing. Physics-based simulation provides the data and flexibility we need in an experimental tool.  However, physical simulations need control systems to produce coordinated behavior. There are currently no general techniques for designing control systems for life-like human motion. We propose a novel control design method for complex human behaviors.  Our approach combines the life-like motion of recorded human data with the flexibility and rigor of physics-based simulation.  We will apply this control design technique to the simulation and control of dynamic running.  The resulting simulation will produce life-like human running and physical data suitable for analysis.  The simulation will accommodate changes in running speed, incline, and backpack weight and produce data regarding the forces, loads, and energy of the virtual subject.  BENEFITS:  Companies that produce equipment for athletes, soldiers, or civilians could use an advanced human simulation systems as a means of rapidly designing and valuating products for human use.  Combining simulation of the individual with group level simulation and control could provide means of analyzing how group performance is affected by equipment or logistics.",

A series of hydroxy-functional, dye-attached polymers designed specifically for 193 nm BARC usage will be synthesized in virtually rote reactions. Subsequent formulation with a thermal crosslinker and catalyst in safe solvent solutions will provide thermosetting products, thus assuring insolubility of the cured film in photoresist solvents. Comparable work has already provided commercial 248 nm BARCs. BARC properties considered necessary for compatibility with unilayer 193 nm resists will be measured. An Olin/Lucent poly(cyclic olefin/maleic anhydride) 193 nm resist, that has already shown considerable promise with one of our thermoset BARCs, will be used for profile studies.

Compared to current microbolometer designs which require a series of difficult deposition steps, an ion-implanted polymer-based device requires only a single layer which can be applied by spin coating and then, after ion implantation, can be easily patterned by plasma etching. Freestanding microbolometers can be prepared by simple sacrificial layer processes to increase thermal isolation and improve device sensitivity.  In Phase I, we will fabricate planar microbolometer arrays using an ion--implanted polymer film as the active device material. The arrays will be characterized against specific physical and electrical design criteria with a goal of optimizing a test structure that can be use in a prototype IR imaging device. Two key electrical parameters, resistivity and TCR, Will be optimized to ultimately provide high sensitivity, response, resolution, and stability. Ion-implanted polymer microbolometers potentially offer greater sensitivity than current designs because of their low thermal mass and superior heat capacity and thermal conductivity properties. These features combined with the simple fabrication requirements open the possibility for producing low cost, uncooled IR focal plane detector arrays for a variety of military and civilian applications.",

The model and subsequent training programs will focus on individual soldier decision-making skills pertaining to the employment of lethal force (lethality), force or population protection (survivability), and mission accomplishment (timeliness).  The project's objectives will be twofold:  1) understand how the urban environment affects individual decision-making and task performance;  2) prepare prototype tasks summaries that will set forth the knowledge individual soldiers must know concerning specific tasks they are likely to encounter in high risk urban environments and the skills they must exercise to achieve desired outcomes.  The project's methodology will include both contemporary and historical research into military and civilian police operations in urban settings.  Civilian police practices and procedures will be studied closely because they present a lucrative source of information for pinpointing task requirements and for establishing desired outcomes for soldier-civilian interaction in volatile situations.  The conceptual model will be used to develop tasks, conditions, and standards that will form the basis for prototype programs to train soldiers in urban decision-making skills.

        "abstract": "Most dimond like carbon (DLC) deposition processes require gaseous hydocarbon breakdown on high temperature tolerant substrates.  A team of Argonne National Laboratory demonstrated that fullerenes can be used as DLC precursors and that an H2 or O2 rich environment is not required.  Burek is extending a similar fullerene techique to DLC coating of plastic materials.  Injection molding of plastics is the process of choice for rapid, low cost component manufacture, however, even highly loaded polymers wear poorly.  A low temperature plasma based DLC coating technology has the potential to enhance platic materials and find applications with metals and ceramics as well.  The hardness and scratch resistance of diamond makes it the perfect material for polymer wear coatings on gears, sprockets, and parts exposed to corrosive envirnments.  Advances in coating clarity will expand the uses to include telecommunications, information storage, and consumer goods.  A busek designed fullerene ion source was developed as a thruster for satellite propulsion, and has additionally shown the capacity to deposit hard carbon films at low temperature on polyetherimides.  Busek proposes to investigate, develop, and characterize these high hardness DLC coatings on two polymer sustrates, polyetherimide (Kapton TM) and polymethylmethacrylate (PlexiglasTM).  This technique promises low temperature, high deposition rate, high uniformity, broad area coverage, low process variability, and with the recent reduction in fullerene prices, low coating cost.",

Xenon is the fuel of choice for these thrusters because of its high mass and low ionization potential. Existing worldwide xenon production will not permit fueling of more than a small fraction of the projected satellite population unless significant price increase of Xe is realized to justify higher production capacity. A convenient alternative to Xe production through air liquefaction is a proprietary technique proposed herein. Xenon produced in this manner can generate extremely high purity xenon. The Phase I program provides a conceptual design of a large-scale facility and a proof-of-principle experiment.

        "abstract": "The electric power capacity of military and commercial satellites, especially those intended for communication is rapidly increasing.  Transponder power requirements and ever increasing number of channels drives commercial satellite designs to 20 kw levels with higher power designs to come.  The beneficiary of this trend is electric propulsion, in particular Hall thrusters, who's role is expanding from station keeping to orbit transfer and even orbit raising.  The need for high power Hall Thruster has also been identified by the recent USAF Scientific Advisory Board.  Stemming from the experience of the Gulf conflict, the Board recommended the development of fast repositioning capability which was recognized by the recent Air Force IHPRPT program focused on 3 to 10 kw Hall thruster technology development.  To satisfy these needs, Busek proposes the development of a novel 8 kw Hall Thruster capable of effficient operation over a broad range of Isp and thrust to satisfy the conflicting requirements for high Isp station keeping and high thrust orbit repositioning/raising.  In Phase I, a laboratory model 8 kw thruster will be designed, built and tested in our existing facilities.  In Phase II, advanced prototype will be built and tested at Busek and at the Air Force Research Laboratory that has expressed strong interest in a collabortive testing program using advanced diagnostic techniques.",

Based on a natural model of team decision making, this system enables the capture of the design rationale in value-added activities.  Team support is provided for ad-hoc activities, those based on engineering best practices, and for methods that integrate evaluation results.  The architecture of ConsensusBuilder allows for the future expansion to other design processes.  The Phase I proposal is focused on developing a design for ConsensusBuilder using current software development best practice as a strategy for applying ConsensusBuilder to its own design.  In other words, the ConsensusBuilder model developed in earlier research will be refined toward implementation using the current model on paper to support key decisions.  ConsensusBuilder is the result of over 12 years of studying and modeling design engineers by the PIs, and the integration of research results from the fields of negotiation and argumentation modeling, design rationale capture, decision theoretics, and engineering best practices.  The model underlying this proposal forms a basis for capturing design rationale by integrating best practices (current and new) and by providing tools to support team decision making.",

        "abstract": "Production of 3D terrain databases for visualization requires resolving tradeoffs between a complex set of constraints: time, resources, accuracy, resolution, hardware, limitations, etc.  The relationship between these parameters and the quality of the final database for most applications is not well understood.  There are few tools to measure quality and there is little understanding of the impacts of data uncertainty on end applications, so there is little incentive to expend additional resources to achieve an unappreciated and unmeasurable return.  Our main objectives are to formulate a comprehensive approach for tracking fundamental quality attributes through the database production and scene generation processes, and to develop methods to evaluate database quality for various applications, especially for scene generation.  The research will involve: defining fundamental quality attributes for terrain database generation and visualization; documenting the processes of database production and scene generation, with emphasis on establishing and tracking quality attributes and identifying processes that modify quality attributes; developing quality evaluation methods for scene generation and other simulation applications, establishing critical levels of quality for these applications; and developing a methodology to portray the resulting scene quality to an end-user.  Our proposal is a collaboration of three companies, each with unique technical specialties to address key aspects of the problem.  BENEFITS:  The potential benefits of this work are wide spread.  For DOD applications, the main advantage will be for mission rehearsal, training and battlefield visualization, where understanding the differences between virtual and real worlds is of great importance.  Commercial applications such as land-use and urban planning will also benefit from this approach.  Coryphaeus Software will provide the vehicle for commercialization of the proposed research, with extensions to their existing COTS software for visual simulation.",

Cryo-ESR's are widely used as the most accurate absolute standards of radiative flux and irradiance. In Phase 2, we will focus on the additional research required to demonstrate that the advantages of SCT thermometry can be translated into: (a) LN2-cooled ESR's of comparable accuracy, but easier accessibility, than conventional, LHe-cooled instruments; (b) LHe-cooled ESR's capable of improved detectivity for detector calibrations in the aerospace industry; and (c) more stable pyrheliometers operating at 90 K for space-borne monitoring of radiations in solar total and ultraviolet irradiance. This research will include development of high-Tcsuperconducting heater leads having low thermal conductance, of an SCT thermometer based on thin metal films with Tc between 2-4 K, and characterization of a prototype LN2-cooled ESR through intercomparison with LHe-cooled ESR's at CRI, and calibration at the NIST HACR facility. CRI is the world's leading manufacturer of cryo-ESR's, and identifies total domestic and foreign markets of $10-15 M for this important new technology if the Phase 2 objectives in accuracy and system detectivity can be met.",

The proposed research explores the feasibility of modifying convertional thermoset resins such as polyepoxides with other compatible and complementary curing polymers to produce new classes of UV light initiated, ambient temperature curing adhesives. The ultimate objective is to develop an easily processed adhjesive with high adhesion to reinforcing fibers and cured composite materials, no cure sensitivity to oxygen, and the ability to be used in composite fabrication processes such as pultrusion.  The proposed hybrid systems cure by a combination of chemical processes which take advantage of complementary reactions and thus result in faster cure rates than either conventional resin system alone.  In the proposed study, the candidate materials for these resin blends will be identified, a new type of UV-activated curing agent synthesized, the compatibility of different resin components predicted by computer simulation, structure-property profiles determined and the ability to cure into useful materials by UV light initiation demonstrated.  Adhesion properties of the candidate formulations and controls with metals and fiber-reinforced composites will be measured and compared.",

Limitations of conventional polyether and polysulfide-based sealants include: the slowness of cure below room temperature, solvent thinning and degradation at elevated temperature.  A novel gap sealant based on conductive particle-filled, highly flexibilized thermoplastic elastomers (TPE) is proposed for this application.  The rigid blocks have high polarity for fuel resistance, high temperature stability and metallic particle compatibility.  The flexible soft blocks are selected from rubber precursors having inherent resistance to aviation fuel and glass transition temperatures below the proposed lower use temperature range.  The novelty of the approach would stem from the mode of chemically linking the TPE components to achieve the desired property profile.  The proposed sealant system should effectively protect aircraft structures from environmental damage and exhibit high electrical conductivity.  TPE's will be formulated with electrically conductive fillers and rheological modifiers and tested for adhesion to aluminum and composites, electrical conductivity, fuel and water barrier properties, resistance to thermal and chemical degradation, and corrosion inhibiting properties.  The physical performance will be compared to commercial sealants meeting MIL-S-81733.",

        "abstract": "A new type of ceramic-thermoplastic material is proposed for fabricating composite armor.  The proposed research explores the feasibility of modifying sukucate-based ceramics with thermoplastic toughening agents to produce a new class of composite matrix resins.  The novel gradient morphologies predicted for these hybrid systems will be used to improve matrix-reinforcement compatibility and overall composite ballistic resistance.  The outer layers of the matrix resin will exhibit the hardness of inorganic glass while the inner layers will provide compliance to maximize shock wave propagation throughout the reinforcing fabric plies.  The proposed matrix resin system can potentially be used in resin transfer molding (RTM).  State-of-the-art polyaramide textile reinforcements will be used with these matrix resins to fabricate high-impact resistant composites.  The ultimate objective is to develop an easily processed composite with high strength and hardness, low density, and the impact resistance required to survive a variety of ballistic threats.  In the proposed study, the methodology for preparing these novel ceramic hybrids will be developed an structure-property profiles determined.  The resulting material property relationships will be used in the design and fabrication of new composite-based airframes with high survivability.",

        "abstract": "Anhydrous ammonia (NH3), a heavily used nitrogen fertilizer, is a volatile gas which flashes at -40 F. It is handles as pressurized liquid and difficult to meter accurately and dispense. Its low cost, due to inexpensive energy, has encouraged wasteful over-application rather than investment in currently costly and ineffective application control systems. Ammonia costs will increase with energy costs and environmental concerns over nitrates in ground water will motivate growers to more efficiently apply NH3.\n\nThis project will apply pulse-width modulation, already proven for liquid agrochemicals, to NH3 dispensing. Specifically, PWM control will maintain ammonia as liquid during metering and distribution across the tool bar. Additionally, a thermal recovery manifold will capture the cooling from the expansion downstream of the metering valves and cool the incoming ammonia. A simple electronic system and user interface will control the metering valves and monitor the thermodynamic state of the ammonia to assure accurate dispensing.\n\nBased on Phase I results, the system is expected to greatly improve the uniformity of application across the tool bar boom and provide a much faster response and significantly wider range of application rates than existing technology. The system will be easily adapted to GPS and variable rate application.",

Given this focus, the objective of this Phase I proposal is to demonstrate the utility of a robust, decision-centered, Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) methodology as a powerful approach to analyze team collaboration in a complex military domain.  Specifically, the focus of Phase I will be to extend the state-of-the-art in CTA by applying a function-based Cognitive Task Analysis (Roth and Mumaw, 1995) to a complex, dynamic, military C2 domain.  This function-based CTA will develop an explicit representation of critical goals, supporting processes, as well as critical information and collaboration requirements.  This representation will form the critical underlying framework for an assessment of team decision making effectiveness, modifications to crew structure, information transfer requirements, as well as the development of revolutionary human-system interface design technologies to dramactically improve team decision making performance.  Phase II, then, will focus on building this design and analysis team CTA tool.  This will take the form of two distince levels of effort.  First, the proposed CTA tool will be applied to another team domain to explore its applicability to other complex military collaborative environments, since the results of a function-based CTA are entrenched in the semantics and complexities of the target domain.  Second, the development effort will focus on addressing the critical needs for this team CTA tool to be used as means for supporting the design of human-machine interfaces to support team collaboration.  This is expected to include issues such as scenario generation, collaboration requirements, team decision support/HCI innovations, and training for skill acquisition.",

        "abstract": "Nicalon fiber-reinforced SiC matrix composites owe their good mechanical properties at room temperature to either C or BN interfaces, which provide a weak interfacial bond.  However, C and BN interfaces encounter oxidation problems at elevated temperatures in oxidizing environments resulting in degradation of mechanical properties.  Recent efforts to replace C and BN interfaces have identified alumina-titania and mullite as potential interface materials.  However, the sol-gel deposition of alumina-titania and mullite coatings directly on Nicalon fibers degrade the fibers and result in Nicalon/SiC composites with low strength and toughness in the as-processed condition.  Hence, there is a need to deposit these oxide coatings by alternative low cost approaches without degrading Nicalon fibers to obtain Nicalon/SiC composites with desired strength and toughness.  The Combustion Chemical Vapor Deposition (CCVDsm) technique can quickly apply uniform, high quality, dense thin films of metals and oxides in a continuous manner at atmospheric pressure. The high quality CCVD process is low cost and versatile. It does not require a reaction chamber or furnace, yet the thin films produced are comparable in quality to CVD films, and CCVD technology allows substrates to be continuously passed through a deposition zone for production line or large area coatings.  In this Phase I effort, alumina-titania and mullite films will be deposited by CCVD initially on flat substrates, such as LaAlO3, YSZ, and SiC.  Subsequently, the deposition of alumina-titania and mullite coatings ( if necessary thin fugitive C coatings) will be carried out on Nicalon fibers and the morphology, microstructure, and mechanical properties of the coated fibers will be determined as a function of  deposition conditions.  A series of run studies will be performed to optimize the process, then a final run series will be performed to demonstrate reproducibility.  This research will demonstrate the capability of CCVD to inexpensively deposit high quality, dense, smooth thin films of alumina-titania and mullite on to Nicalon without degradation of fiber strength for composite a",

        "abstract": "Corrosion damage to aluminum structural components is very costly to both the government and commercial industry; viable treatments and/or protective procedures are required to limit it.  Paint and related conventional coatings are commonly used to combat corrosion, although such coatings often may degrade quickly requiring frequent reapplication or touch-up; this is expensive and labor-intensive, especially in the field.  Higher performance conversion coatings are prepared with processes which use hexavalent chromium, now considered to be a major health and environmental hazard.  Thus, there is a compelling need for alternative, environmentally benign, low-cost coating technologies to protect aluminum components and structures subjected to corrosive environments.  In addition, reduced weight is desired. MicroCoating Technologies, Inc. proposes to develop its safe, clean, economical Combustion Chemical Vapor Deposition (CCVD) process to fabricate high-quality, dense, pinhole-free, metal-oxide thin films as replacements for the chromate conversion coatings. The patented CCVD method is an open atmosphere deposition system capable of true heterogenous vapor deposition of dense, high quality films but at a fraction of the cost of the traditional vacuum processes, Chemical Vapor Deposition and Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD).  Since CCVD processing is not confined to a reaction chamber or furnace, coating of large objects such as aircraft structural components is viable.  We have already completed experimental work on low temperature deposition of CCVD coatings on aluminum and copper substrates.  Our trial coatings display excellent performance as corrosion-barriers under wet conditions in tests performed by both Battelle (1300+ hours of saltwater spray) and an industrial partner (30 day SWAAT).  We will detail these preliminary results further in the proposal. In Phase I, we will build on this initial success and work with our industrial collaborators to develop CCVD metal-oxide coatings with negligible weight for protection of aluminum structural components in both military and commercial applications.  Phase I success will lead to a Phase II program to scale and automate the CCVD process for high rate, low cost production.  This SBIR research will be planned, developed and commercialized through Phase III in collaboration with our industrial partners.",

        "abstract": "For the past eleven years, researchers have been investigating possible applications of high temperature superconductors and working to solve the problems that must be overcome to yield practical superconductor technology.  One area of interest is the coated superconductor cable which consists of a flexible metal substrate, a protective buffer layer, and the superconducting layer.  Short lengths of these coated conductors have been made yielding critical current densities (Jc) of 1MA/cm2, but the problem arises when trying to scale the conventional deposition processes up to accommodate long lengths of wire.  Also, low interaction with magnetic fields is needed for many applications down to 77K.Combustion chemical vapor deposition (CCVD) is a low-cost, open atmosphere deposition that has the potential of depositing buffer layers and the superconductor YBCO onto metal substrates in continuous reel-to-reel production.  CCVD does not use costly vacuum systems required by conventional techniques, while the coating quality rivals and even exceeds that of conventional methods.  CCVD coatings can be smooth, dense, and epitaxial.  In Phase I, we will investigate CCVD deposition of ~50nm textured buffer layers, such as CeO2 and SYZ, onto textured reduced magnetic substrates provided by Oak Ridge National Laboratory,.  These buffers are key component layers of coated superconductor technology.  We will demonstrate the quality and performance of Phase I CCVD buffer layers through subsequent CCVD deposition of YBCO superconductor layers.  The optimized CCVD process will be demonstrated in a reel-to-reel production mode, using polycrystalline substrates.  The most promising Phase I textured coated conductor samples will be sent to ORNL for testing and evaluation.",

Novel sensors are proposed to directly monitor the amount of corrosion within the aircraft structure.  These sensors will monitor the actual corrosion as well as corrosive conditions and will transmit measurements at regular intervals to a central processor onboard the aircraft.  Maintenance personnel need only link to the central processor to determine when corrosion levels reach a threshold requiring service, thereby reducing overall service time and cost. Several means of data transmission are explored.  During Phase I we design and develop a prototype system using wireless transmission of data.

Methods using adsorbed oxygen to scavenge electrons that participate in the recombination reaction are slow, which then keeps the photo destructive efficiency low.  By eliminating this inefficiency, the transport of wastes and reaction products to and from the surface of the titania (TiO2) anode can become rate limiting.  Reactor design, is also important.  This project will develop a two-layer, titania-based, composite photoanode which (a) can readily drain UV-generated conduction band electrons to an electrical sink, and (b) can support perpendicular flow of reactants and products.  The concept presented is readily manufacturable and cost-effective for producing photoanodes on a variety of porous, high-surface-area substrates.  Specific objectives of this project are to: (1) fabricate the desired photoanode, (2) test its ability to completely mineralize a typical chloro-organic compound in water, and (3) evaluate and compare its destructive performance against that of other known immobilized photocatalytic methods which use titania.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   Immediate commercial applications lie in the remediation of contaminated ground-water and in the cleanup of dilute low volume industrial and small shop outflows.  Of particular interest to the government and to private industry is the cost effective removal of halogenated organic materials from those waters.\n\n_",

Devices fabricated by thin film deposition techniques have been replacing those made by more traditional thick film processes due to better sensor reproducibility and long term stability.  However, thin film sensors have low surface area and are susceptible to surface poisoning.  In order to expand the usefulness of chemical gas sensors, novel film formation processes leading to improved film microstructures need to be developed.   This project will fabricate a mesoporous metal oxide semiconductor as a possible alternative to traditional thick and thin film sensor layers.  Tin oxide will be used as a model material.  If successfully fabricated, the mesoporous structure\u00bfs high surface area will mitigate the effects of poisoning, and it\u00bfs very good structural stability will improve reproducibility and long term stability of sensor response.   Phase I will first develop the process to make mesoporous powders of tin oxide.

The proposed study will develop a 3-dimensional code incorporating advanced physical models for droplet transport/vaporization and spray combustion by using solution-adaptive unstructured meshes and efficient parallel algorithms. \n\nThe Phase 1 effort demonstrated proof-of-concept by developing a baseline spray dynamics module incorporating heat and mass transfer and coupling it with an existing unstructured reactive flow solver. Comparison of model predictions for non-evaporating and burning sprays with experimental data showed good agreement. In Phase 2, the code will be extended to include state-of-the art models for droplet physics, such as multi-component droplets; droplet-turbulence interactions; droplet deformation, breakup and collisions; soot and gaseous emissions; detailed chemical kinetics; and group combustion, and stochastic spray. Additionally, solution-adaptive meshing techniques and algorithm improvements will be incorporated into the code. As part of a verification study, the developed code will be subjected to a series of test cases for which analytical solutions are available. Comprehensive benchmark validation of the code will be performed against data being collected at the NIST Spray Combustion Facility. A variety of full-scale 3-D waste fuel furnace/incinerator simulations will be performed to demonstrate the capabilities of the code. Prof. Aswani Gupta of the University of Maryland and Prof. Clayton Crowe of Washington State University will be consultants during the Phase 2 project.

Due to strong current commercial software capability and similar pintle valve control technology, CFDRC will be able to draw on existing software to: perform the transient CFD calculations (CFD-ACE. CFDRC's commercial CFD code); automatically generate grids for the design configuration (CFD-GEOM - a GUI-driven geometry and grid generation program); and control the transient response of the system using advanced inverse control logic (PINCON- a pintle valve control simulation environment validated using ATR propellant development test data). These areas will be integrated with nozzle design methodologies and simple propellant ballistic performance to create the Phase I design software.  The Phase I software will be validated at little additional cost with data generated from testing of a prototype low cost axial pintle motor concept at Atlantic Research Corporation. All developed software and engineering data will be delivered to MICOM, ARC and Aerojet at the conclusion of Phase I.  During Phase II the CFD/controls based pintle motor design tool will be fully coupled to advanced internal ballistics modeling and CFDRC's MultiDIscilpinary Computational Environment (MDICE).

        "abstract": "The proposed program has the potential to completely eliminate water-borne hydrazine using a new and novel approach.  Currently, wet air oxidation is the most popular method used.  This novel approach uses 2450 MHz microwave energy to decompose hydrazine and related compounds in a water solution.  We have discovered that microwave energy couples directly to hydrazine in water solution resulting in complete selective decomposition of the hydrazine to harmless hydrogen and nitrogen.  This direct decomposition takes place at ambient conditions, thereby significantly reducing the capital and operating costs.  The CHA process can be added onto existing water scrubbers and produces no additional waste material.  The process is based on the use of carbon adsorbents to capture both the contaminants from the water phase and microwave energy.  The hydrogen product is oxidized to water before being vented to he air.  In Phase I of the proposed approach, the CHA Corporation will demonstrate the technical and economic feasibility of the process.  Phase II will be devoted to developing and implementing the proposed approach.  We will design and construct a full scale operational prototype and will demonstrate the effectiveness of the process with Hydrazine, Mono-methyl Hydrazine, and Unsymmetrical Di-Methyl Hydrazine.",

Design will feature direct mounting on the ion pump connector, eliminating high voltage distribution cables.  Phase I will investigate available radiation tolerant switchmode power supply, microcontroller, log amplifier, A/D converter, and other components for use in a variety of topologies to meet the needs of the next liniear collider sustaining vacuum pumps.

Robust performance is assured through the use of complementary AI techniques (e.g., fuzzy logic, belief nets, probabilistic rule-bases), and by providing aiding at the highest level allowed by available data and knowledge. Adaptive assistance is assured by allowing the user to customize an information and display profile to best fit the current situation.  We propose to develop AVID using COTS software, and demonstrate it in the domain of battlefield monitoring.  BENEFITS:  Commercial applications of the generic AVID architecture exist in a variety of contexts characterized by high-information flow rates, decision-making under uncertainty, and distributed  players,                                                              cial services, rail and air traffic control. Vertical applications for these markets would significantly improve effectiveness and safety in a number of life-critical applications.",

        "abstract": "The growing digitization of the battlefield gives the commander an opportunity to access large amounts of information, but only a portion of this may be important at any one time in answering his Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRs).  PIRs are critical to the commander for making tactical decisions to accomplish the mission and each PIR necessitates identifying relevant tactical information from available intelligence sources during the course of the battle.  We propose to address this by prototyping a Toolset for Acquiring Critical Tactical Information from C4I Systems (TACTICS).  The TACTICS architecture will provide: 1) a graphical user interface for constructing a belief network for each PIR representing the causal relationship between significant battlefield events and possible answers to the PIR; 2) a network speculative analysis and evidence propagation capability to determine what information is critical to answer the PIR; and 3) an information filtering and retrieval mechanism to discard irrelevant information received by the commander and to acquire critical information from available C4I systems such as ASAS and MCS; filtered and retrieved information is then propagated through the network to obtain an answer to the PIR.  Tactics will be validated in an appropriate battlefield scenario context.",

        "abstract": "We propose to design and prototype a search agent for smart munitions that exploits  multiple information sources to aid an automatic target recognition (ATR) system's target acquisition capability.  Smart munitions that rely on preprogrammed search paths (the weapon's flight path over the search area) ignore the dynamic nature of a battleground and fail to exploit important information that can be monitored in-flight but cannot be foreseen at launch.  For example, unexpected weather events such as sandstorms or blizzards can greatly degrade an ATR sensor's fidelity, but weapons following preprogrammed paths cannot                                                                              n assessment of the current situation by monitoring events from dynamic onboard data sources such as ATR output and flight performance parameters, and correlating them with static sources such as mission planing data and digital elevation maps. If the resulting situation calls for a new search path, a trajectory optimizer generates a new path (subject to constraints such as know friendly positions) that improves the probability of accomplishing mission objectives.  When path choice depends on the enemy's course-of-action, a separate course-of-action prediction module contributes constraints based on identified avenues of mobility and knowledge of the enemy's military organization.",

        "abstract": "We propose the development of a system for visually tracking and interpreting human gestures for the purpose of controlling devices, improving training methods, and interacting with virtual worlds.  That is, we intend to implement a gesture recognition and device control system.  In many applications, using gestures for device control has many practical advantages over other -forms of input, such as speech or keyboard.  These advantages include longer input device life due to the lack of moving parts, improved hygiene in systems used by the public, less system degradation by a noisy background environment, and more intuitive commands represented as gestures. We will implement a gesture recognition system which performs in a cluttered background environment using standard video and an inexpensive PC-based system.  We intend to use the static and dynamic properties of gestures for real-time recognition, transforming dynamic parameters into reference trajectories used for device control and interaction in virtual worlds.  Further, we propose the development of a system which uses both static and dynamic gestures to control the information provided on a public information kiosk.  For example,  detailed maps could be displayed and manipulated with gestures.  BENEFITS:  The fundamental technology developed under this Phase I is important because it facilitates a more dynamic interaction between humans and devices.  As a result, it would allow many commercial areas to profit, such as entertainment (video games and virtual reality simulators), manufacturing, and telerobotics.",

        "abstract": "The military has a strong need for telerobotic fire fighting equipment because the current operating procedure for combating fires in hazardous areas is to deploy humans, but once the fire exceeds a predefined level, the people are removed from the scene and the fire is left to burn its course. There arc two problems with this procedure: first, people are put at risk since the fire fighters might not be removed from the scene in a timely manner. Second, by letting a fire run its course, there is a larger loss of materiel and an increased probability of secondary conflagrations.  This project proposes to carry out the trade studies necessary as a precursor to the development of a telerobotic fire fighting vehicle. Such a vehicle will provide fire fighting personnel with greater capabilities for combating fires in hazardous areas because it will be possible to remotely deploy the vehicle, thus allowing greater operating times without the attendant risk to personnel. Such a vehicle will have many of the capabilities of manned fire fighting systems, such as on-board, multiple agent systems; external water pumping capabilities and a suite of sensors for providing vital information to the remotely located fire fighting personnel.  BENEFITS:  There is a strong, civilian market need for teleoperated fire fighting equipment for hazmat applications. Hazmat fires occur at chemical plants, manufacturing plants, refineries and other, common commercial sites.  Due to the cost and danger associated with deploying human fire fighters into these situations, a teleoperated fire fighter is a cost efficient means for fire fighting.",

Such a human observer would find such a task tedious and costly to perform. Fortunately, a sensing system is not bothered by tedious tasks. Such a system could be implemented to prume out obviously normal behavior, and tag human activities which could be suspicious and would therefor need more attention by a human operator. However, such behavior recognition systems have not been developed due to the difficulty of identifying and classifying such motions.  We propose the development of a system which not only identifies humans in the environment and their location, but can also classify and identify their activity, providing a threat assessment.  The heuristics needed involve recognition of information bearing features in the environment and the determination of how those features relate to each other over time.  This is gesture recognition.

Telfon-based lubricant can be used in certain low speed applications.  However, large quantity of telfon for high firing rate application attract large amount of sand.  A new generation of lubricant system is needed.  Considering an operation in a sand enviroments for DoD applications, solid lubricants coatings are attractive candidate.  Their applications in gas engine, bearing and information storage have been developed with long endurance, low fraction and weaving.  In general, they are not able to resupply in situ. We propose a novel solid lubricant firm with ability of in situ resupplying.  This concept is based on world wide achievments on lubrication, sol-gel technique and hard coating. A layer of hard coating is firstly deposited on surface.  A composite glass-ceramic coating is deposited on top to enhance lubrication.  The top layer is able to be resupplied in situ.Sol-gel based process provide a possibility to easily resupply lubricant firm.",

        "abstract": "We will develop a novel type of Residual Life Indicator (RLI) for determining the remaining capacity after prolonged storage of Chemical Protective Garments (CPC).  These garments, which are designed for use by troops at risk of exposure to chemical weapons, can be stored for long periods of time in sealed bags.  However. if a bag leaks or is punctured, common air pollutants like fuel vapors and paint fumes can consume the protective capacity of the garment, making its use hazardous.  Our RLI will be a passive device, consisting of a piece of clear plastic coated with indicator chemistry.  The device will function by causing the appearance of color on the plastic side as a result of contaminant vapors displacing a carefully chosen dye from an adsorbent on the other side of the RI. The adsorbent will be chosen to accurately reflect the behavior of the protective adsorbent in the CPC. These devices will be rugged, relatively low cost, and potentially of use under conditions of actual threat exposure as well as in storage.  BENEFITS:  Low-cost Residual Life Indicators for chemical protective gear will provide assurance to chemical emergency response teams, including fire fighters. law enforcement personnel, industrial workers, and environmental remediation personnel,   that their protective clothing is in working order on removal from storage prior to use under hazardous conditions.",

This superiority has also brought with it unwanted high production costs for these arrays. The next generation of Naval towed arrays with increasingly larger aperture may be out of the reach of a cost conscience Navy. The innovative technology described in this proposal will dramatically reduce the costs of providing this underwater acoustic superiority by automating the construction of towed arrays. It will provide a continuous array design ideally suited for optical  hydrophones and telemetry. It will dramatically reduce the number of modules used to form an array and eliminate the fiber and strength member splices required at these terminations. The technology uses machine wrapped open cell foam, machine wrapped optical fibers which carry the telemetrized hydrophone signals, machine installed internal strength members, and a continuously extruded outer hose wall. This automated construction maintains high array reliability in a low flow noise hydroacoustic design while dramatically reducing the fabrication costs.",

        "abstract": "This research focuses on reducing the amount of re-verification necessary for reusable software components The work addresses a fundamental problem facing the reuse of software: when a software component that has been verified to a given level of reliability in one environment is reused in another, how can we assess the same level of reliability for the component with the minimum amount of re-verification. Through solving this issue, software development and maintenance will realize the time and cost benefits of software reuse. Our approach to solving this problem is to collect internal data state information during verification. By collecting this information, along with the output produced by the state, we are able to                                         ess whenever a data state created during re-verification is identical to one already collected during verification. When this occurs, we are able to immediately halt the current test case since we already know the outcome of the test. This method of shortcircuiting the re-verification process will have tremendous time and cost impacts for those components where this technique can be applied near the beginning of the component's execution.  BENEFITS:  This research will benefit all government and commercial software developers by reducing the cost of using reusable software components.",

        "abstract": "This research will investigate a practical technique for detecting the existence of computer viruses and other software corruptions in real-time.  As one goal of the SBIR-subtopic is audit-analysis tools that are amenable to real-time systems, our innovation will allow DARPA to detect worrisome behavior and apply appropriate roll-back mechanisms before problems propagate to an unacceptable level.  Our approach tries to differentiate between                                              odeling intent.  One way to do this is by creating a set of expectations about the behavior of  programs and detecting deviations from those expectations.  We will begin this effort by providing a mathematical model of program execution and describing the difference between legitimate and illegitimate program  behavior based on expectations.  Next we will investigate the difficulties in applying this model to practical situations by showing the computational complexity associated with simplistic application of the model.  We will go on to discuss the application of AI techniques (such as connectionist modeling) to the problem of anomaly detection.  We will then discuss some of the risks associated with these less accurate implementations that eliminate complexity in exchange for accuracy.  Finally, we plan to develop tool-design requirements leading to the prototyping of such an innovation.",

        "abstract": "We propose to investigate the use of Adaptive Vulnerability Analysis (being developed under DARPA contract number F30602-95-C-0282) for analysis of Java applets and applications.  Java - a platform-independent, Internet-savvy programming language - has found widespread acceptance and has been adopted for use in critical defense information systems such as the GCCS.  It is essential to develop and extend security assessment techniques, including AVA, to counter information warfare threats.  AVA has been successfully implemented in the Fault Injection Security Tool (FIST) prototype for C and C++ source code.  FIST employs software fault injection to force anomalous program states during the execution of software and to observe their corresponding effects on system security.  If insecure behavior is detected, the perturbed location that resulted in a violation is isolated for further analysis and possible retrofitting with fault-tolerant mechanisms.  Extending AVA to handle Java code will require significant research investigating the effects that differences between C/C++ and Java have on fault injection analysis.  One such difference is Java's memory management system which uses garbage collection and array bounds checking.  Another is Java's use of exceptions.  Phase I of the project we propose includes developing a Java JDK 1.2 parsing capability for FIST and undertaking a feasibility study for a complete Java-capable version.",

There are presently no proven or accepted methods for prevention or treatment of IHN. Under the intensive conditions of aquaculture, IHN virus (IHNV) causes significant losses at nearly all stages of production. The results of Phase I studies indicated that intraspecific variation for IHNV resistance exists in rainbow trout and steelhead. The results of molecular genetic studies indicated that sufficient genetic variation exists both within and between the two strains of Oncorhynchus mykiss to allow for identification of genetic markers associated with IHN resistance which would significantly reduce the time required to develop IHN resistant strains.\n\nThe Phase II research will determine the linkage of molecular markers to quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with resistance to IHN. Disease resistance has a high environmental component of variability in expression, making it difficult to not only study but also to breed for the trait. Finding a molecular marker that is linked to a QTL will permit more rapid gains in selection for improvement in IHN resistance by marker assisted selection. This approach has found widespread use in plant breeding for viral disease resistance.",

        "abstract": "CdSe, a wide bandgap semiconductor, combining high resistivity, good carrier trans-port properties, and large average Z number is ideal for use as a room-temperature x-ray and y-ray detector. In the x-ray regime, the large bandgap (-1.7 eV) of GdSe eliminates the need to cool the crystal in order to reduce thermal noise. Si and Ge detectors must be cryogenically cooled, which precludes their use in portable systems. CdSe is a promising alternative to CdTe and HgI2 y-ray detectors. CdSe detectors exhibit no polari-zation under bias in contrast to the high resistivity Cl-doped CdTe; they are also superior to HgI2 in terms of carrier mobilities as well as thermal. chemical, and mechanical stability. However, the presence of electron traps in CdSe due to Cu and Ag impurities is the limiting factor responsible for preventing its use as a room-temperature nuclear radiation detector.  During Phase I, improved purity and resistivity CdSe would be grown. The goal would be at least two orders of magnitude improvement in these properties. The resistivity, mobility-lifetime products, and impurity levels of the material would be characterized for use in nuclear radiation detectors. Detectors would be fabricated and evaluated in terms of energy resolution and counting efficiency. Phase II would target continued material improvements along with contacting and fabrication issues unique to CdSe.",

The Indirect Cooling System (ICS) uses engine fuel as the heat sink in a manner similar to work already accomplished by the USAF IHPTET program.  ICS provides additional advantages in terms of fire safety, reduction in exposure time to fuel deposit formation, the ability to remove and maintain the fuel heat exchanger and the ability to optimize the design of the fuel heat exchanger for reduced deposit rates independent of the design of the air heat exchanger.The program includes preliminary design of all hardware relating to the ICS, steady-state and transient code analysis of key components and the overall system, and code prediction of fuel deposit formation rates and their performance effects.  Comparison will be made between ICS and the current IHPTET direct heat transfer approach.The program also includes definition of a fuel deposit test program including the detail design of the test hardware.  This test program would further advance USAF high temperature fuel technology by focusing on the deposit influence of heat exchanger geometry, surface coatings, and high Reynolds number.",

The low weight, small size, and high efficiency of the system, resulting from a novel design with dramatically reduced cooling requirements compared with existing eyesafe transmitters, make it suitable for airborne and spaceborne applications and other environments for which compactness is required. The laser transmitter, operating in the eyesafe band with excellent atmospheric transmission, delivers Q-switched pulses with an average optical power of 10 W while consuming only 200 W of prime power (i.e. 5 % wallplug efficiency). Multi-functional operation, with hard target range and microdoppler (vibration) measurement capabilities, is made possible by the low intrinsic heat load in the laser medium. The low heat load allows variation of the laser pulse repetition frequency over wide ranges, including operation at 50 mJ pulse energy at a pulse repetition frequency of 200 Hz, and single-shot                                                      eyesafe laser systems, the reduced cooling requirement in the proposed system eliminates the need for liquid coolants.

Such multiaperture architectures are anticipated to provide 4(pi) steradian coverage with unprecedented capabilities on airborne platforms.  However, two primary technical hurdles prevent realization of a first-generation system.  One is finding an acceptable means of delivering high energy (0.1 to 10 J) 10-ns class laser pulses to the remote ports with near-diffraction limited wavefronts.  The other is to provide rapid, precision pointing of the laser and receiver fields-of-view.

        "abstract": "A missing key component in current laser systems for target tracking/identification and optical remote sensors is a compact, high repetition rate, moderate average power (10W) laser operating at eyesafe wavelengths.  To meet this need, a diode-pumped solid state laser is proposed which utilizes an exceptionally small and robust package scheme for high efficiency systems.  The design capitalizes on an innovative Solid State Raman Laser (SSRL) operating at 1,5 micron wavelength.  When compared to other IR lasers and frequency converters, SSRLs offer significant advantages:  (1) beam clean-up, where low beam quality pump lasers are converted to near diffraction-limited eyesafe output:  (2) temporal pulse compression, which enhances range resolution; (3) higher nonlinear gain; (4) small physical layouts; (5) lower cost crystals.  Moreover, SSRLs are not birefringent phase matched, as optional parametric oscillators are, so high power operation is not limited by thermally-induced dephasing and nonlinear crystal temperature control is not required, reduced package complexity and size.  Coupling CTI's experience in SSRLs with its established capability in turnkey flight-worthy systems will facilitate new dual-use lasers.

The source incorporates a novel laser tuning and linewidth control architecture that permits shot-to-shot control of the OPO output frequency over the entire tuning range, with linewidths less than 0.25cm (-1).  In Phase I, CTI will demonstrate laser source efficiency, tuning and linewidth control.  In Phase II a man-portable, battery-powered, air cooled brassboard sensor will be built.

The sensors must operate at multiple wavelengths through a common aperture and require wide field-of-view, all reflective, off-axis optics.  The limitations in thermal stability, weight-savings and cost that are associated with current aluminum telescopes can be overcome by using carbon fiber  reinforced composite material in con-junction with optical replication processes.   The goal of this SBIR project is to significantly reduce the life cycle costs of sensors and improve their system performance and usefulness by introducing thermally stable, high stiffness, low density material.  This goal will be addressed by designing, developing, manufacturing, and testing sample mirrors and a composite afocal telescope for LRAS3.  Our plan is to install the new all-composite telescope in an existing LRAS3 electro-optical sensor, evaluate its performance, and directly compare it to the current diamond-turned aluminum reflective assembly.

The pintle technology, long studied and promoted by Aerojet, offers exciting prospects for the advancement of controlled solid propulsion systems.  Our team has many years of experience in the development, testing, and analysis of many applications of pintle technology.  Herein are discussed important aspects of the application of pintle technology such as; two phase flow, erosion, thermal expansion, transient loading, and internal ballistics.  These phenomena have an important (indeed critical) bearing on the design and analysis of the subject configurations.  Aerojet's long history of research and development of this technology has been supported by CEA in the development of CFD analysis tools which address the phenonena important (in many ways unique) to this propulsion concept.  This long term involvement has led to the creation of CFD analyses which treat many of the complicating factors occurring in these novel situations.  We look to this procurement as a mechanism to further our own pintle nozzle technology and to provide this significant experimental and computational resource to the industry.  In the Phase I portion of effort we will deliver a CFD analysis which is based not only on academic developments but also on the ongoing experience in the real world application.

        "abstract": "An advanced computational framework for scramjet combustor simulation will be developed via turbulence extensions to a finite-volume implicit/upwind Navier-Stokes code that presently contains generalized multiphase combustive capabilities and is operational on parallel architecture machines using domain-decomposition with MPI protocol.  Turbulence upgrades will include: use of nonlinear (explicit algebraic Reynolds-stress) extensions to two-equation turbulence models such as ke; nonequilibrium compressibility extensions; variable turbulent Prandtl number modeling; and, an assumed PDF approach for turbulent chemistry.  A unique feature of this framework will be the ability to use different turbulence modeling procedures in different zones, recognizing the limited invariance of even the most sophisticated turbulence models and the need to cater such models' varied dominant features.  Phase I work will be limited to gas-phase combustion while Phase II will emphasize multiphase combustion aspects as associated with solid propellant gas generator partially burnt products and varied new fuels (gel-based, fullerenes, etc.).  Analyses of relevant scramjet experiments utilizing swept ramp injection concepts to enhance mixing with minimal performance loss will serve to validate the advanced turbulence modeling framework.  BENEFITS:  This work not only benefits scramjet and related airbreathing propulsive technology, but also enhances our ability to analyze other missile components such as lateral jet thruster interactions and base combustion, critical for TMD interceptor design and signature applications. Support to improve noise reduction in commercial airplane turbofan exhausts (via turbulence upgrades) and overall performance enhancements in internal combustion engines (via turbulent-chemistry methodology ) result from this work.",

This computational framework includes large eddy simulation (LES) methodology for transient turbulent simulation and multi-step decomposition/combustion of condensed (liquid and solid) phase, in additional to generalized gas phase kinetics.  In Phase I, a prototype model will be demonstrated for the complete sequence of events occurring from the onset of CB container rupture to dispersion/entrainment of partially neutralized BC agent into neighboring rooms of the storage facility, and culminating in atmospheric dispersion.  The requisite-coupled methodology has been derived from simulations of atmospheric dispersion of CB agents resulting from threat missile intercept.  The model utility will be demonstrated by conducting simulations of varied neutralization concepts in an end-to-end mode.  Assessment of modeling parameters having the dominant influence on systems parameters (toxicity concentrations, dispersion range of CB agents, etc.) will be performed, and, the steps towards developing a systems-oriented engineering model via lumped parameter simplifications to advanced Navier-Stokes methodology, will be identified.",

        "abstract": "Ultrafiltration membranes offer great potential for compact, low cost clean-up of Navy surface ship graywater and blackwater.  A major limitation of these ultrafiltration membranes is significant loss in flux with time associated with membrane fouling from proteins, polysaccharides, and other waste products.  Backflushing can only be used to a limited extent.  Chemical treatments are undesirous since they pollute.   ompact Membrane Systems, Inc. has developed unique low surface energy perfluoropolymer coatings.  These perfluoropolymer coatings appear to be a universal non-fouling surface showing enhanced resistance to biological fluids (blood, platelets, SF-21, Vero cells) and oils and, therefore, should greatly enhance the ultrafilters fouling resistance.  These perfluorocoatings represent a universal approach to enhancing ultrafilter resistance in that we have successfully coated numerous ultrafilters (polysulfone, cellulose, esters, polypropylene, PVDF).  Preliminary results indicate that coating of ultrafilters with CMS perfluoropolymers can significantly enhance fouling resistance with little change in bulk flow.  By using these perfluoropolymer coatings, we will enhance fouling resistance without introduction of chemical pollutants.  In Phase I, we will:  (1) coat various ultrafilters with our perfluoropolymers, (2) perform controlled internal laboratory evaluation of enhanced fouling resistance, (3) in conjunction with DoD, perform pilot operation with preferred candidate graywater, and (4) perform economic analysis based on results from (2) and (3).  Objectives of Phase I are to demonstrate stable ultrafiltration capability in excess of 20 liters per square meter per hour using high density waste streams (15-20 grams/liter) for over 1000 hours of operation.",

Munshi, Principal Investigator\nDr. Naseem A. Munshi, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG03-98ER82554\nAmount:  $75,000\n\nSuperconducting fusion magnets require the use of insulation systems capable of withstanding significant mechanical loads at cryogenic temperatures while also enduring high doses of neutron and gamma radiation.  Because of the increasing demands placed on the insulation system during operation, the insulation is a very critical component in need of improved performance.   In addition, new magnet designs have made the processing requirements of  insulation systems an important factor since the most easily processed systems do not meet these criteria.  The objective of this project is to develop, formulate, and characterize new, organic resin insulation systems that are suitable for use in a vacuum pressure impregnation (VPI) fabrication process for superconducting magnets used in fusion devices.  The new resin systems will be formulated and evaluated for their processing properties (such as viscosity, pot-life and cure), mechanical and electrical properties, and gas evolution during irradiation.  \n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   The development of new insulation for superconducting magnets which are more radiation resistant and can still be easily processed will benefit current magnet manufacturers as well as future fusion magnet designers.  New materials that withstand higher doses of radiation will allow newer, more efficient designs of fusion magnets, providing new, efficient energy._",

        "abstract": "From a control theory perspective, ballistic missile defense requires a distributed dynamic non-linear control system. The conventional approach to coordinating the allocation and use of components that are geographically dispersed and functionally diverse is through a central management function that contains missile defense system and element control law.  This central manager has to deal with the complexity of each of the cooperating missile defense elements, their operational characteristics and control methods.  A centralized system controller design adversely affects reliability, survivability, and maintainability.  As an alternative, a collection of less complex neural controllers, each of which controls a mutually exclusive subset of the missile defense elements and is cognizant of overall system need, will be investigated.  The Collection Of Homogeneous cOoperating contRollers Toolkit (COHORT) will support the creation of intelligent, adaptive, and cooperating controllers.  Distribution of the system-level management and control design has the potential to reduce complexity and improve system reliability and survivability.

The traditional approach, simultaneously solving all competing chemical reactions by hand, is only feasible for simple systems.  Current computer programs for calculating chemical equilibrium are inefficient and difficult to use, requiring user-input initial values and expert knowledge of the system under consideration.

        "abstract": "The increased complexity of the modern electronics increases size. which reduces speed because of time delays in the interconnects. As a result. for frequencies above a few GHz, asynchronous communication between subsets of a complex system is unavoidable. The disadvantage of this approach is the need to recover the phase (clock) of the digital signal, which for semiconductor circuits requires a few thousand clock periods. Recovering the phase of multi-bit-rate signals is even more difficult. A clock recovery circuit with locking time of one bit has been developed at Conductus which makes it available for asynchronous communication even with multi-bit-rate signals.  For Phase I of the project Conductus will develop and test the clock recovery circuit at frequencies up to 40 GHz. The chip will be fabricated using TRW niobium nitride (NbN) technology on a subcontract basis. and tested at Conductus. Conductus will also design the optimum architecture for the multi-bit-rate clock recovery system, which will have a frequency recognition unit with short detection time. For Phase II of the effort, Conductus will propose to develop a complete integrated clock recovery unit. operating at 10K. supporting multiple bit rates, and packaged in a closed-cycle refrigerator.",

This proposal assembles an existing fast panel analysis (to conform the flow field to the aircraft body shape), existing flow field models for fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters (to predict the detailed wake structure off the trailing edge of the wing and rotor blades), and an existing Lagrangian particle solver (to track the released chaff in the directions dictated by the pyrotechnics), all wrapped into an existing user-friendly user interface developed for the US Air Force under a previous SBIR contract.  All of these existing, state-of-the-art codes have been developed by Continuum Dynamics, Inc.  and need only be assembled and extended in the Phase I effort.

        "abstract": "Controlling main rotor blade-vortex interaction (BVI) noise is a central issue both in detectability of military helicopters and community acceptance of rotorcraft operations. Research to date has produced substantial insight into the BVI phenomenon, though attemps to formulate practical design or active control strategies to reduce BVI noise without significant performance degradation have met with limited success. This proposal involves the development of innovative  methods for applying on-blade control using Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) smart materials technology to tailor blade loading, deformation, and wake structure to minimize BVI noise in key flight conditions without incurring prohibitive penalties in performance, vibration, or cost. Recent advances in actuation of control surfaces with SMA-driven devices have made feasible a variety of on-blade control concepts for noise reduction and have brought the goal of a variable design blade - optimized to minimize noise in critical flight conditions within reach. Advanced computational aerodynamic models will be used both to assess several candidate  on-blade control techniques and to provide insight into BVI events. The proposed effort will involve validation of these models followed by parametric design studies of several SMA-based  control devices, laying the groundwork for eventual demonstration of successful concepts at model scale.  BENEFITS:  The noise control technology to be developed here would have direct application to mitigating the strong BVI noise generated during helicopter landing and approach. Such noise poses an enormous operational difficulty for the rotorcraft industry, and a viable control mechanism for BVI noise and vibration would address one of the industry's most important challenges in community acceptance and passenger comfort.",

        "abstract": "Continuum Dynamics, Inc. (CDI) proposes to develop an advanced modeling capability to assess the environmental impact of sonic boom penetration and its effect upon marine mammals.  The approach will utilize Computational Aeroacoustics (CAA) numerical techniques which allow the generation and propagation of sound to be directly calculated from the fundamental governing equations.  The proposed effort will be the first use of such techniques in water and will include bubble entrainment and choppy ocean effects.  The surface of the ocean will be modeled as a stochastic process with spatial and temporal correlations which can be prescribed at will, a major improvement over previous deterministic studies of sonic boom penetration.  Any sonic boom shape may be imposed as a time-dependent boundary condition on any realization of this randomly described surface.  The resulting pressure pulse propagating into the ocean will then be calculated by CAA techniques from the governing Euler equations with due account for body forces (e.g. gravity) and bubble entrainment effects.  The numerical results can be displayed either as instantaneous (                                            an or as the time dependent pressure time history at specified observer locations to facilitate assessment of the environmental impact of aircraft or missile operations",

        "abstract": "The extraordinary potential of high-temperature composite materials to meet the engineering design challenges presented by advanced turbine engines is well known.  Implementation has been seriously impeded by high cost and fabrication difficulties. Recently, continuous microcomposite monofilaments were produced by physical vapor deposition (PVD) methods to provide an improved alternative to drum-wound foil/fiber or plasma-sprayed monotapes. Such metal matrix composite (MMC) precursors are highly uniform and reproducible. Moreover, the local fiber volume fraction is precisely that desired in the consolidated macrocomposite structure, making the precursor ideal for a precision fiber placement and consolidation scheme.  In the proposed work, a unit consolidation process will be modeled and developed using laser energy to effect consolidation of continuous SiC/Ti PVD MMC precursor wires.  Feasibility of the approach will be demonstrated in Phase I by fabricating representative cylindrical test specimens. Phase II will explore the dimensions of the processing window, relying on parametric studies to model the consolidation response surface and produce a high-quality full scale demonstration article.  The Phase II focus will be on design and development of a commercially viable manufacturing process for components having complex geometry.  BENEFITS:  Next-generation commercial aircraft turbine engine components will benefit greatly from possible weight savings of more than 50%, compared to currently used superalloys.  However  truly staggering economies will come from power plants using large land turbines, for which 5% more efficiency can result from a 100\u00bfF increase in operating temperature.",

This program will employ a new class of liquid crystalline material, which is stable in multiple states, and existing high-speed electrooptic materials to fabricate a high-speed latching solid-state optical switch. The proposed device will be robust and operate over a wide temperature range (cryogenic to ~50\u00bfC). In Phase I of this program novel drive electronics will be developed to optimally utilize this new bistable materials technology.  Currently, no bistable optical switch technology has been demonstrated which can meet the demands of military environments (especially space-environments). The technology proposed in this program can.",

We propose to investigate the application of these technologies to optimizing registration of live/virtual objects and generation of information superiority training scenarios.  Information superiority is one of the goals of the military of tomorrow.  A warfighter is confronted with situations that border on chaos.  Speed, tension, and complexity all impact a warfighter's performance (and thus a mission's Chances of success).  One of the major issues facing a warfighter is the fact that the information he/she receives comes from various sources, and these sources may produce outputs that are in conflict with each other.  Such a condition is known as information dissonance.  Learning to deal with information dissonance and leveraging of information superiority are the keys to attaining situation awareness.  Helping the warfighter to experience and attain situation awareness through ET/ES can be viewed as a means of preparing the warfighter to experience and attain situation awareness on the real battlefield. The training of the warfighter, then, must reflect these battlefield conditions and make use of available information in a similar way. Our proposal also addresses this key need of future ET/ES systems.  BENEFITS:  Any situation in which a human must learn to resolve conflicting or dissonant information from multiple sources in a time-critical fashion stands to benefit from our proposed approach.

These electronics would be ideal for high-temperature applications for electric combat vehicles, including vehicle propulsion, active protection, electric gun and turret control.  Therefore, silicon carbide has been identified as a critical electronic technology for use in future armored vehicles.  To fully enable the capabilities of silicon carbide electronic devices, a high-temperature high-field dielectric must be developed.  Alternative dielectric materials for use on SiC merit thorough investigation, however, silicon dioxide should not be dismissed as a high-temperature high-field dielectric.  There are several potential dielectric materials of interest, including A1N and various combinations of silicon, oxygen and nitride.  It is proposed that these alternative dielectrics be evaluated for use as high-temperature, high-field gate dielectrics or field passivation.  In addition, we propose to look at three materials with extremely high dielectric constants for this application.  This effort will include producing metal-insulator-serniconductor (MIS) capacitors in SiC to evaluate which dielectrics show superior applicability for device operation at 350\u00bfC.

Unfortunately, currently available photosensors all have serious shortcomings:  (1) the photomultiplier tubes are bulky, fragile, and sensitive to magnetic fields, and (2) the silicon avalanche photodiodes are too expensive to use in large areas.  Other solid state photosensors are not sufficiently sensitive for this application.  This project will determine whether a new design of silicon photodiode known as the Avalanching MRS (Metal-Resistance-Semiconductor) detector would offer performance comparable to that of beveled-edge avalanche photodiodes while being much more manufacturable.  MRS detectors use a very simple manufacturing process, and probably could be mass produced inexpensively, unlike normal avalanche photodiodes which use a handmade production process and cost approximately $1000 per square centimeter.  In Phase I, this new photosensor design will be assessed by building and testing a batch of them.  Successfully building these detectors using automated \u00bfplanar\u00bf processes would demonstrate that they could be inexpensively manufactured.  Testing their light sensitivity using simulated and real scintillated light would demonstrate their superior performance.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   The proposed detectors could be applied to many of the same applications currently addressed by standard avalanche photodiodes.  In addition, new applications would become feasible due to the projected reduced cost of MRS detectors compared to avalanche photodiodes.

This project will develop a bio-detector based on surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (SPRS)/surface plasmon enhanced raman spectroscopy (SPERS) instrumentation that can rapidly detect ultra-dilute contaminants in water.   A self-contained miniaturized high resolution SPRS instrument capable of detecting dioxin or PCBs leached from soils by groundwater coupled with a SPERS instrument for positive identification and quantitation will be tested.  This device will directly and rapidly detect leached contaminants by following the antibody-antigen interaction, specific for these compounds, in the liquid phase.   Phase I will develop a stand-alone, user friendly, SPRS instrument with a flowcell for waterborne contaminants.  Its biosensor component will be specific to strongly sorbed leachate contaminants such as TCDD or PCB.  The instrument will be tested with a Raman spectrometer to prove that SPERS can be used for quantification.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  An automated device which can rapidly and directly detect the presence of ultra-dilute contaminant compounds should prove to be highly marketable in the environmental industry.

When properly prepared, these AlN substrates should be superior to all substrates currently available commercially.  In particular, the AlN substrates have significantly superior chemical compatibility, lattice/crystal structure match, thermal expansion match, and thermal conductivity when compared to sapphire substrates that are currently being extensively used for eptixial growth.  In addition, the higher thermal conductivity, larger band-gap energy and higher thermal stability of AlN will be attractive for many nitride applications.  However, two key technical issues need to be overcome before AlN substrates can be used for epitaxial layer growth for device application.  These key obstacles are: (1) the extreme hardness of the AlN makes it easy to propagate microscopic defects into the surface of the substrate when mechanical polishing is used; and (2) the removal of the oxide layer on the AlN surface prior to epitaxial growth.  We will determine wafer grinding, polishing and chemical cleaning techniques that can be scaled up into an AlN wafer production facility.",

        "abstract": "Launch dynamics are a major design driver in structural design of spacecraft and their components.  Launch survival is often a more difficult design problem than is insuring operational performance in orbit.  The development of a multi-functional spacecraft adapter for an EELV (Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle) which integrates the three functions of spacecraft attachment, whole-spacecraft vibration isolation, and spacecraft release is proposed.  Simultaneous design and integration of the isolation system, release mechanism, and adapter will lead to an optimized system.  Reducing the dynamic loads on the spacecraft by whole-spacecraft isolation will allow lighter weight systems, greatly reduce the risk that the spacecraft and its instruments will be damaged from vibration during their ascent into orbit, and will also allow more sensitive equipment to be included in missions.  As the severe launch environment also accounts for much of the expense of designing, qualifying, and testing spacecraft components, significant cost can also be saved if loads are reduced.  Phase I will develop the concepts and design the isolation system.  Low-shock release mechanisms will be designed into the system.  System-level coupled-loads analyses will be performed using complete launch vehicle and spacecraft models.  As the EELV is currently being developed, now is the ideal time to introduce whole-spacecraft isolation for this launch vehicle.",

This adapter is designed such that it cleanly integrates the three primary functions of 1) mounting multiple spacecraft, 2) providing vibration isolation for each spacecraft, and 3) releasing each spacecraft with low-shock separation systems.  While multiple spacecraft have been launched on a single launch vehicle on many occasions, neither vibration isolation nor low-shock spacecraft separation has been included.  This program will propose and investigate the feasibility of several adapter designs.  Advanced passive vibration isolation devices, advanced composite structures, and advanced low-shock spacecraft release mechanisms will be employed in all designs.  System-level coupled-loads analyses will be done using complete launch vehicle and spacecraft models to assess each design concept and optimize the vibration isolation design. It is anticipated that this program will result in a multi-spacecraft vibration-isolating adapter design that reduces spacecraft responses due to structure-borne launch vehicle vibrations by a factor of three or more.  This will allow the spacecraft designer to design primarily for mission performance rather than launch survivability.  Each of the multiple spacecraft being launched in this reduced-vibration environment can be designed with less primary structure and more fuel or more science instruments resulting in expanded mission and cost savings.",

Much of this environment is due to sound radiated from the fairing structure, which encloses and protects the payload while providing a smooth aerodynamic surface for interaction with the atmosphere during launch.  The severe acoustics cause structural vibrations of the payload that can damage components and threaten mission success.  The proposed program will demonstrate the feasibility of incorporating passive, viscoelastic material damping into composite payload-fairing structures while maintaining their strength and stiffness.  The work will focus on design and manufacturing methods, including co-curing of viscoelastic with composite material, to greatly reduce costs and improve performance compared to existing fairings.  Finite elmeent analysis will be used to determine candidate configurations.  Proof of concept panels will be fabricated and tested.  Measurement will be used with a combined finite-element/boundary-element acoustic analysis to predict performance of a fairing built with this technology.

        "abstract": "The Airborne Laser (ABL) system has extremely tight jitter requirements.  Acoustic disturbances, such as those caused by the pressure recovery system of the high power laser, are a significant jitter source.  At present, plans for acoustic mitigation rely on passive approaches.  There is, however, some uncertainty whether these approaches will provide sufficient attenuation.  CSA Engineering proposes to develop active acoustic jitter suppression technologies for application to elements of the ABL optical train.  The suitability of the numerous acoustic suppression techniques will be assessed.  Conceptual designs using the most promising of these suppression techniques will be performed for several ABL components and subassemblies.  Structural-acoustic simulations of the optical elements integrated with models of the host aircraft will be used to evaluate performance levels of these acoustic suppression designs.  The predicted attenuation levels, and the physical practicality and modularity of the designs will be used in an overall ranking.  At least one design will be selected for further evaluation in a hardware demonstration.  In the demonstration, a mockup of the optical element will be constructed and tested for acoustically induced jitter.  The measured jitter reduction with the acoustic suppression applied will provide an indication of levels of improvement that are realistically achievable.",

        "abstract": "General purpose bombs and warheads project fragments of varied mass, geometry, and velocity.  Typically, bombs and warheads are too large to enable economical experimental evaluation of fragment effects. A repeatable, effective, easily employed and maintainable system to explosively launch scaled simulated fragments in a predictable paflern is required.  The proposed solution, The Long Standoff Explosive Gun (LSEG), is based upon Explosively Formed Penetrator (EFP) warhead technology, modified for projecting fragments. The major components of the device are an explosive charge, a liner from which fragments are produced, and a casing. The launcher concept employs recently established multi-mode warhead technology which has been demonstrated in several warhead development programs. The LSEG will be designed to sprelect fragments in a predetermined pattern, and the concept is readily adaptable for projecting fragments of varied characteristics. The LSEG will be developed for use at long standoffs, thereby greatly reducing the amount of blast energy transmitted to the pendulum target. Additionally, the device will use the absolute minimum amount of explosive necessary for launching the fragments at the required velocity, and the explosive charge will he surrounded by a casing in order to attenuate the transfer of the shock energy to the surrounding air. The combination of these three design approaches will ensure the blast loading is minimized.  BENEFITS:  The proposed development program relates to many research efforts currently.being conducted by the Department of befense This program will advance the understanding of controlled fragmentation, and therefore will benefit all programs concerned with optimizing fragment output. The system will have application in evaluating materials and equipment in the design of buildings where explosion effects are a consideration. The launcher would also be applicable to the design of systems for the protection of buildings and vehicles against terrorist attacks.",

        "abstract": "The mechanical properties of explosives control directly their sensitivity due to shock and impact stimuli.  The understanding and measurement of these properties are essential for developing insensitive explosives, and in designing hard-target-penetrating munitions.  These properties include the strength under high pressure (pressure hardening) and the strength under dynamic loading (strain-rate hardening). Under a recent program support by the HERD at Eglin, we demonstrated the feasibility of a simple method of measuring these critical properties.  This method utilizes a copper sleeve to encase the explosive specimen to provide a confining pressure during static or dynamic testing.  In static tests, the sleeved specimen is compressed by a standard testing machine.  In dynamic test, the sleeved specimen is projected against a stationary anvil, which is equivalent to a reversed Taylor impact test.  Preliminary results have shown this method is feasible.  In the proposed program, this method will be developed for practical applications.",

Accurately locating the DNAPL source terms is the key to successful remediation.  Site characterization via soil borings is slow and expensive, particularly when the contamination is deep.  This project will utilize mature fluorescence and soil color sensors and deploy them on direct push probes for real-time mapping of subsurface DNAPLs distribution.  The spatial resolution of the measurements will be improved by a factor of 5-10 compared to currently available sensors.  The Phase I project will design and build a prototype probe that allows simultaneous fluorescence and soil color measurements through the same window, write the data collection and display software, characterize performance in the laboratory, and then perform a field test at Savannah River.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   Better methods to locate DNAPLs source terms will dramatically reduce the necessary time and cost to the government for remediation projects._",

        "abstract": "During Phase I Dakota Technologies, Inc. (DTI) will demonstrate a fuel leak detection system that is vastly superior to the costly, manpower-intensive techniques currently used in repair, overhaul, and production facilities.  The technique uses resonance enhabced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) spectroscopy to test the airspace outside the tank for the presence of certain hydrocarbon constituents of all common fuels; thus, it is not necessary to add tracers to the tank, remove its contents, or otherwise change conditions in order to test for leaks.  Owing to the method's extremely high sensitivity, it can easily pinpoint leaks which are so small that only vapor is escaping.  The real-time response and very high spatial resolution will enable leaks to be detected in a matter of seconds.  The extremely high commercial potential is enhanced by numerous spin-off applications for pipeline leak detection, environmental monitoring, and occupational health/indoor air quality assessments.  DTI and North Dakota State University have already published several papers resulting from our collaborative reasearch on leak detection.  We therefore propose to build an engineering prototype and demonstrate it at an actual aircraft maintenance facility in Phase I, thereby moving well beyond the goal stated in the solicitation of demonstrating the technology on fuel cell test cubes or small scale tanks in Phase II.",

Using these new speech recognition tools together with algorithms which allow interpretation of the spoken messages, it's possible to dramatically reduce the human effort required to process spoken information, while improving information flow.  We propose to use the expertise we have gained from developing our national-award winning VICTOR system and our SPRITE speech recognition and processing system, together with our proven expertise in signal processing and noise removal algorithms, to improve voice communications in high noise environments.  We will design a speech recognition system with high accuracy in high noise environments that automatically responds to voice commands and sends this information to external systems, thus reducing required human effort, improving performance, and increasing the timeliness of information delivery.  Goals include: 1.Designing a flexible, highly accurate speech recognition system that is usable in a high noise, multi-peopled environment;  2.Adapting and implementing noise reduction algorithms resulting in relatively noise-immune speech recognition;  3.Evaluating these noise reduction algorithms and the resulting speech recognition performance;  4.Demonstrating an early prototype system.  BENEFITS:  The most immediate applications are to improving soldier performance.  User-friendly, flexible voice operated systems reduce operator training time and increase operator efficiency.

The program, called the Data Fusion Correlation Algorithm (DFCA), is installed in the SHIELD spaces of the Joint National Test Facility at Falcon Air Force Base, Colorado.  It has been demonstrated in four NMD flight tests.  We believe that the DFCA's innovative approach to sensor-fusion represents a quantum improvement over traditional approaches, but that the approach cannot be properly demonstrated with a laboratory model thrust prematurely into an operational setting.  We propose, during Phase I, to design and implement algorithm enhancements which are critical for the environment in which the DFCA is being asked to perform, and then to demonstrate the enhanced capabilities using data from previous flight tests.  In Phase II, we would continue enhancing the DFCA to meet operational requirements, and demonstrate its performance, in a wider variety of scenarios, during live tests and demonstrations.",

It allows for the addition of new fusion algorithms and new data types. The architecture also allows for adaptation to real time changes in the data. Two popular areas of Al are utilized: intelligent software agents and genetic algorithms. The independent nature of intelligent agents in a multi-agent environment allows them to work independently and in parallel on heterogeneous databases. The results can then be integrated through a collaborative schema. Genetic algorithms are utilized because of their efficiency in searching large data spaces and their adaptability to real time change. To increase human comprehensibility, advanced graphical visualization techniques are used to display the outputs of various modules of the system.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this project is to develop methodology and prototype algorithms for object-level change detection and change explanation using structural SAR image data.  Structural SAR image is obtained by the filtration, detion and transformation of local pixel-level formations of strong and weak electromagnetic (EM) responses into higher-level geometric and morphological micro-elements.  These micro-elements form an image of a new type. Change detection is applied to an image of micro-elements.  The explanation of a change is deducted from the geometric and morphological comparison.  Three algorithms will be developed for (1) the transformation of a pixel-level SAR image in to a geometric SAR image, (2) comparison of object states and clutter characteristics using structural and morphological micro-elemnts, and (3) an explanation of the change in terms of structural similarity/differentiation.  The developed methodology will be validated through three groups of experiments.  We have already shown that the proposed SAR image transformation is not sensitive to illumination level nor is it sensitive, to a certain degree, to small changes in object pose.",

This research will analyze   whether certain features of Ada 95 should be included or excluded from a critical   application. To be of practical value such an analysis will require specific tool   support. The Ada Semantic Interface Specification (ASIS) defines a vendor   independent API for accessing both the syntactic and semantic information stored   within an Ada compiler's library. In this Phase I proposal, we propose to design a   tool utilizing ASIS, which is compiler and platform independent and which will allow   code to be analyzed based on the evolving standard guidelines for critical systems.  The design will employ a layered approach separating the GUI, the ASIS query engine   and the report generator. This combined with the use of Ada/Java technology will   allow the tool to operate on multiple platforms with little or no modification.   The design will be object-oriented with emphasis and utilizing and developing   reusable components wherever possible. The design will be expressed in the Unified   Modeling Language (UML).",

We will demonstrate end-to-end performance from integrating this processing with multiple commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) ASR systems.  Our noise removal processing will include adaptive noise cancellation, adaptive noise power estimation coupled with nonlinear noise prefiltering, cancellation, adaptive noise power estimation coupled with nonlinear noise prefiltering, and a high performance artificial neural network (ANN) noise removal post-filter.  Equalization of channel transfer variations will also be included.  Our ANN processing has already been shown to give much greater gains in ASR noise resistance than any other approach to date.  From prior results, we can expect greater than a 30 dB gain in ASR resistance to background noise, even in highly dynamic noise environments.  Performance will be demonstrated on aircraft maintenance and repair ASR applications in dynamic, high-level, flight line noise environments.  Phase I will develop and demonstrate the basic methods and their end-to-end ASR performance.

The CCTT is the first in a family of interoperable simulators for training a combined arms force in a real-time synthetic environment. The focus of the CCTT is sustainment training for collective tasks and skills in command, control, communication, and maneuver.  Diamond Visionics Company (DVC) proposes a feasibility study and implementation of a video Transmission/Reception system interfacing to a Micro-Display. This system will be capable of being formed into a hand-held system, which is Wireless & Cableless. Phase One will be the Feasibility and Demonstration Phase. In Phase I DVC will design, construct, and demonstrate a monocular non-hand-held technology demonstration system using State-of-the-Art technology.  Phase II will be the development of the Prototype Binocular system, centered on the packaging and the power aspects for hand-held and wireless operation. Phase II will result in one deliverable system to be tested on site and approved for manufacture.  BENEFITS:  The resulting product will be a wireless, compact, and efficient means of Transmitting, Receiving and displaying wide bandwidth video. The application to wireless Helmet Mounted Displays (HMD's) for military training and the gaming market is obvious, and such means of wireless high resolution display has been long awaited in both the military and the commercial markets",

        "abstract": "The objective of this effort is to use an innovative software approach that will link together existing distributive, sensor and tactical information networks.  This software approach will enable on-demand communications connectivity in a seamless MLN environment that can be used in TBMO.  DSR proposes the use of software algorithms to perform a Mapping/Data Distribution Node (MDDN) function on Command and Control (C2) platforms such as the E-2C, the Mission Control Element (MCE), the Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS), and other Naval weapon systems.  The MDDN function will conduct priority exchange of select battle data between units on sensor netting networks, command/planning networks, and tactical communications networks.  The exchanges will be both horizontal (reach additional slensor or shooter platforms) alnd vertical (across networks) to reach various command levels.  DSR will determine the ability of shooter platforms to use Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) composite tracks and/or select CEC sensor/track data and the timelines required for the information exchange, as well as the ability of current information networks to exchange this data.  The software process will determine the best communications path available in the current operational situation, apply routing and prioritization instructions, and map/parse shooter data into appropriate message formats for recipients.  The stacked and branched, open architecture network designed in Phase I will be prototyped in a Phase II proof of concept demonstration.",

        "abstract": "The goal of the proposed development is the creation of multilevel photonic modules comprised of monolithic, InGaAs / InP p-i-n photodetector - p-HEMT power amplifier, Opto-electronic integrated circuit (OEIC), that has 60 GHz bandwidth and output power of 100 mW. The photodetector will have a high quantum efficiency (30%) and will be front-illuminated, thereby improving optical performance.  The proposed innovation will greatly simplify the implementation of miniaturized optically controlled antenna elements.  By integrating the photoreceiver and power amplifier into one OEIC device, the antenna element can be made to resemble a ceramic chip carrier.  The element would have two ceramic substrates sandwiching the InP chip, one carrying the fiber input and the other carrying the antenna output. The overall element would be small, rugged, and hermetic, allowing for conformal mounting onto vehicle structures and other such applications.  Dr. Arthur Paolella of Lockheed Martin's Communication & Power Center will consult.  BENEFITS:  Optical signal distribution for phased array antennas in communication satellites is advantageous to system designers.  By distributing the microwave and millimeter wave signals optically, a potential savings of up to 100 lbs can be achieved.  This weight saving translates into reduced launch costs of $1.5 to $3.0 M per satellite.",

Several concepts will be developed and analyzed.  Innovative structural designs and use of materials will be considered.  The proposed designs will be analyzed to predict their performance levels, fatigue strength, and impact on blade weight and balance.  Evaluation will be based on the analysis plus factors such as cost, reliability, reparability, etc.  Representative portions of a production helicopter blade section including a deformable trailing edge, flexural zones, elastomeric slip joints, and actuation devices will be fabricated.  Manufacturing techniques will explore implementation of smart materials, processing of elastomers, and other unconventional uses of materials to make up the deformable trailing edge.  Static performance will be measured and used to calibrate the analysis.  These sample sections will help validate and discriminate between the different design approaches. They will also provide insight to producability, durability, and areas for improvement.  Recommendations will be made for the most effective structural concept and use of actuation materials.  If successful, a concept will be generated which has the potential to be developed into a flight article and tested.  Follow-on development, i.e. phase II, will be used to fine tune the selected concepts and validate the predictions by testing rotor blade sections and wind tunnel models.

David Doty, Principal Investigator\nMr. George Entzminger, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG02-98ER82565\nAmount:  $75,000\n\n\nHigh sensitivity detectors (of infrared and x-ray radiation and magnetic fields) require miniature, fieldable cryocoolers with low cooling capacity (one watt) continuous cryogenic cooling (to 10 K or lower).  However, the severe vibration of available cryocoolers seriously degrades sensitivity and image quality.  Although too large for this application, Reverse Brayton Cycle (RBC) cryocoolers with turbo-expanders and turbo-compressors are known to have negligible vibration and other advantages.  Therefore, this project will develop a micro-expander based on similar principles.  Ceramic microturbines (rotor diameter ~4 mm) will be developed which have been proven in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) sample spinners at over 1.3 million rpm.  Phase I will design a novel RBC cryocooler and complete a series of feasibility and risk reduction research experiments on the critical components:  (a) micro-cryogenerators; (b) micro-turbo-expanders; and (c) compact, high-effectiveness recuperators.  In addition, the system design, including detailed assembly drawings and dimensioned part drawings, will be developed.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The current market for cryocoolers with the one watt cooling capacity is several thousand units per year for (a) high-sensitivity radiation detectors and imagers, (b) targeting devices, and (c) MRI and NMR superconducting magnets.  In addition, two very large markets may develop in the next century:  liquid hydrogen fuel refrigeration and cryogenic microprocessors for advanced engineering workstations.\n\n_",

This project investigates extrusion as an alternative means of wood fiber cement mass production. Our Phase I research has demonstrated that refined wood fiber cement mixtures can provide rheological attributes suiting extrusion, yielding geometrically diverse extruded products of distinctly high durability with a desirable balance of technical and aesthetic qualities. The proposed Phase II research will optimize the extrusion system of wood fiber cement on a broad raw material basis, and will adapt the system to satisfy market needs in diverse fields of application. The proposed Phase II research will: (1) optimize the process variables of extrusion in light of the rheological attributes of wood fiber cement; (2) develop cementitious matrix mix compositions optimally suiting extrusion with diverse wood fiber types; and (3) identify and explore markets of greatest commercial promise for extruded wood fiber cement products.",

        "abstract": "One of the most important problems in the nondestructive inspection of aircraft is the detection of cracks and corrosion under fasteners, in the lower layers of lapped structures.  Existing methods for inspecting such structures require either that the fastener be removed, or that the instrument be redsigned for each new inspection problem.I propose to remove these limitations with a new eddy-current sensing system which varies that applied-field distribution and sensor configuration to fit the gemometry of the inspection problem, thus maximizing the flaw signature and minimizing the background signals due to the fastener head and nearby structures.  This new approach is possible in part because of new magnetic sensors which provide very low noise over a wide frequency range.The new instrument will detect cracks and corrosion around ferrous and nonferrous fasteners of varying size, in structures made of aluminum, titanium, or ferrous metals, at depths ranging from 1 mm or less to 10 mm or more.  Its high sensitivity at low frequencies will enable the inspection of very thick structures, and its low noise will signicantly reduce inspection times.",

Dual, Incorporated (Dual) proposes research and development work to develop and assess the feasibilitv of 3D Decision Support Rendering Tool (DSRT) concepts and technology for evolving battle planning and visualization applications. DSRTs are innovative tools designed to enhance portrayal and comprehension of battlespace information through recent, scientifically-based information visualization and interaction techniques.  Classes of DSRTs will portray various types of decision support information concerning battlespace missions through use of enhanced rendering algorithms inside a real-time SD environment.  Intuitive DSRT sensory cues such as shape, color, shading, texture, transparency, and location will be used to represent dynamic battlespace realistic and abstract information.  Dual proposes a Phase I effort to demonstrate the technical feasibility of DSRTs for battlespace visualization which sets the foundation for Phase II prototype development, software integration, and effectiveness assessments.  The anticipated result of this project is a delivered embedded prototype DSRT system for the military application of battlespace planning and execution.  This design will be based on theoretical and experimental graphical display research and experimentally tested for effectiveness.  BENEFITS:  Commercially viability is demonstrated by current positive interest and support from local transportation and land development customers concerning Dual's DSRT software applications.

Dr. Larry Drzal of Michigan State University, who has ongoing work for the automotive industry on this topic, will be a subcontractor on this SBIR.  Zoltek, who markets a low cost, large tow carbon fiber, will support the work in this SBIR and will incorporate in their product line enhancements in carbon fiber sizing/processing.  The Dow Chemical Company will also support the work in this SBIR and assist in commercialization of the technology.  In Phase I we will explore alternate ways of improving bond strength between carbon fiber and vinylester resins, and downselect a method for development in Phase II based on experimental evaluation of competing methods.  In Phase II we will scale up this process, demonstrate its enhanced properties experimentally, and fabricate a large primary structure demonstration component.",

The high brightness is made possible by accelerating photo-electrons produced by a short pulse laser at an X-band (8-12 GHz) rf frequency.  It will employ a novel accelerator design called the plane wave transformer in which cells are strongly coupled, easing manufacturing tolerances and saving cost.  Phase I work will include design of the X-band accelerating structure and the focusing solenoids using numerical simulations and cold test models.  Beam dynamics simulations will be done to insure achievement of a low-emittance beam.  Engineering design of the rf power system and the laser system will also be made in Phase I.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   Ultra-short photoelectron bunches are useful in future linear colliders and in compact electron injectors for advanced light sources such as free electron lasers, synchrotrons and Compton backscattered X-rays, with a myriad of uses in research, industry and medicine.\n_",

        "abstract": "The duPont Aerospace Company, Inc. proposes to design an innovative inlet suitable  for a hypersonic cruise missile.  The innovative features consist of  an inlet cowl  which rotates outward from the retracted position to accommodate the airflow  requirements of the engine, a coordinated variation in throat area and possible  elimination of boundary layer bleed. The retracted position allows the engine to be  closed off for hypersonic glide operation, and the various extended positions  match the engine airflow requirements over the Mach number range from zero to six.   The coordinated throat area variation matches the contraction necessary to reduce  the inlet Mach number to a low value prior to the final  normal shock.  Boundary  layer bleed requirements may be eliminated providing a more efficient overall  solution if the resulting distortion is acceptable for the turbine engine.    The Phase I work consists of CAD design and associated aerodynamic analysis  using duPont proprietary methods which have been thoroughly proven in the NASP  program.

        "abstract": "Acoustical MCM and ASW operations in shallow water are plagued by the prevalence of false targets as well as strong reverberation and multipath. The combination of imaging and environmental adaptivity may be the key to overcoming these problems. Synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) is a revolutionary technology which provides at least an order of magnitude search rate improvement over side looking sonar (SLS) while maintaining the same resolution. Important classification and identification cues are obtained at search ranges by imaging the target's highlight structures and acoustic shadow. These cues will reduce false alarm rate (FAR) in MCM and may present the only viable means by which to discriminate low or no-doppler targets against clutter in ASW.  Extending SAS capabilities into shallow water requires modifying the SAS processor to account for propagation effects. Dynamics Technology, Inc. (DTI) proposes several alternatives for incorporating model-based matched filtering (MBMF) into the existing SAS processing stream to counter multipath distortions of the signal waveform. We will also evaluate the effectiveness of                                                         ely tracking environmental variations in the SAS imaging context.

It will suppress geomagnetic noise increasing the performance of airborne MAD.  DTI has identified candidate sensors, auxiliary sensors, platforms, and signal processing and noise reduction algorithms. The candidate platforms are UAV, balloon, or buoy.

A thorough system analysis will reveal the optimum GRSS from among the various candidate systems, and also demonstrate its feasibility.

In Phase 1 we will: (1) perform system analyses based on existing DTI models, (2) identify and characterize candidate sensor, platform, and processor systems and their operational constraints and costs in cooperation with potential vendor partners, (3) demonstrate system feasibility by modeling performance of a system based on identified components using best available sensor platform characteristics and a suitable processor mockup, and (4) determine Phase 2 prototype development requirements and vendor partners based on the feasibility analysis.",

This solution is based on the innovative concept of integration of digital switching of tuning elements directly on the aperture surface.  A single patch antenna can then be digitally tuned to successively lower frequencies, modifying the patch dimensions to the new resonant dimension by adding small strips.  This technology may, in principle, be used over extremely broad frequency ranges, limited only by the performance of the switching devices employed in the aperture.  RF power requirements on the switching devices (PIN diodes or GaAs switches, for example) are low relative to both the total radiated power because the incident RF power is distributed over several devices.  The switching devices are readily controllable by digital computer commands which could be incorporated into existing crew instrumentation.

Previous research efforts have shown the merits of composite truss structures using a novel interlocking system developed by Ebert.  The system allows assembly of structures without adhesives, bolts, or joint reinforcing material.  Large, very high strength, easy to assemble structures are possible using relatively low cost materials.  However, extensive precision machining of the base pultruded material is required to produce individual components of a structure.  Previous research has also shown that this will require multiple machining steps separate from the pultrusion process to produce the strongest possible joint.  These machining steps are time consuming, which restricts the ability to produce low cost components.  During Phase I, Ebert proposes to design a pultrusion process that seamlessly integrates high speed precision machining.  General machining concepts will be developed and tested using in-house equipment with a goal of demonstrating the capability of synchronized machining of pultruded components.  The option period would develop a test truss structure and a pultrusion/machining specification as a lead-in to Phase II development.",

In order to provide the necessary performance and reliability, the thin film fabrication process must be tightly controlled to ensure proper composition, uniform, thickness, and desired stress state in the HTS films.  Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is emerging as the process of choice for the deposition of the HTS thin films such as YBCO.  Reactions in the PLD chamber often are governed by mechanisms that are complex functions of temperature, pressure, laser beam uniformity and plume dynamics.  Process control is of paramount importance in order to achieve high quality HTS films with properties that are reproducible from run to run and which have lateral uniformity over the coated area.  Phase I research will ential fabrication of several Raman optical probe assemblies/configurations and demonstration of their application for obtaining Raman spectra for in-situ real-time analysis of PLD growth of HTS thin films.

        "abstract": "The development of corrosion protection coatings for aluminum aircraft alloys is proposed.  The coatings are based on polyaniline and other conducting polymers that are incorporated into anodized coatings by oxidative electropolymerization during the anodization process.  The coatings will have a two-phase structure with the conducting polymer in the pore volume of the anodic coating.  The anodic coating provides a mechanically robust structure that protects the conducting polymer from abrasion while providing a suitable surface for topcoating.  A corrosion inhibition mechanism based on adsorption and mobility of the conductive polymers is also proposed for the protection of A1 alloys as well as electrochemial stabilization of the Al oxide surface.  To enhance transport and adsorption, and thus corrosion inhibition, the development of a series of modified polyaniline-based polymers and oligomers is proposed.  These polyaniline derivatives would be used in Phase I to identify the predominant corrosion inhibition mechanisms and incorporated as polymerizable monomers or oligomers into an acid-based anodization solution.  The effect of anodization conditions, conductive polymer doping, and post anodization sealing will be investigated using Al 2024-T3 coupons.

The polymers will be further mixed or overcoated with one or more layers that selectively adsorb or react with the agent/analyte.  The change in conductivity is elicited by an effective change in work function or oxidation/reduction (redox) level associated with adsorption of the analyte or analyte product on the underlying conducting polymer surface.

U.S. troops face increasing risk of exposure to chemical and biological warfare threats as poorer nations turn to lower cost chemical and biological weapons for their  arsenals.  Despite the increased threat from these toxic agents, gas mask technology has remained virtually unchanged over the past several decades, leaving soldiers at risk to newly developed nerve and biological agents designed to defeat conventional granular activated carbon (GAC) gas mask technology.  EKOS Materials Corp. proposes a novel activated carbon fiber (ACF) that will combine the low cost and durability of GAC with the good contact efficiency, high surface area potential and simple in situ regeneration capability of commercially available ACFs.  Water treatment testing by an industrial partner and gas mask testing by the U.S. Army is planned in Phase I to demonstrate the benefit of this unique materials.  Given the low cost constituents and the relatively simple processing, the potential exists for producing a new adsorbent material which is cost competitive with GAS ($1-$ 2/lb.) and much more effective due to the ability to tailor the pore size and pore surface chemistry.",

Innovative and proven manufacturing technologies such as electroforming have been overlooked as means meeting these needs. It offers the means to fabricate seamless tanks with no property degrading welds. In conjunction with filament winding, electroforming can produce improved tanks in greatly reduced time frams because it can produce the mat-erial and the net shape simultaneously. Nickel-low cobalt alloys are currently avail-able through electroforming with yield strengths in the 100 to 150 ksi range. Efforts to develop titanium electroforming are expected to enhance the competitiveness of electroforming to produce much lighter tankage by virtue of the low density of this metal. Capability to electrodeposit bonded liners in filament wound outer shells will provide further fabrication innovations for the tank designer.",

The measured temperature of the screen can be correlated to the magnitude of the incident near-field radiation and will give an immediate indication of the radiation condition of the phase shifters. The phase of the incident near-field radiation can be measured using microwave holographic techniques to give an accurate indication of the actual phase of the phase shifter.The near-field magnitude and phase of the radiation can be transformed to the far field using standard Fourier Transformation techniques.

This project is an attempt to replace the conventional coal gasifier with a catalytic membrane reactor (CMR) system which operates by catalytically separating oxygen directly from ambient air, thereby reducing power consumption.\nA novel process for the oxygen-blown gasification of coal fines will be developed, using advanced CMRs based on mixed oxygen anion and electron-conducting brownmillerite materials.   CMRs will be utilized for the efficient, spontaneous conversion of coal fines and steam to a valuable chemical feedstock and fuel source consisting of hydrogen and carbon monoxide.   Phase I will result in the selection of preferred components (membrane and catalysts) and optimal process operating conditions for promoting the oxygen-blown gasification of coal fines in the presence of steam using a mixed conducting membrane technology.  The goal is to most effectively use the oxygen transported through the membrane reactor for the gasification of humidified coal fines to form a high quality CO and H2 product mixture.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  This technology should result in a less costly method for converting coal into value-added chemicals or fuels while also having a low environmental impact compared with currently used technologies.  Utilization of catalytic membrane reactors should allow for an economical way to use pure oxygen in the gasification of coal._",

        "abstract": "This program is directed toward synthesis of two closely related classes of new lithium ion conducting polymer electrolytes which hold promise of achieving both higher ionic conductivity and improved elastomeric properties over current state-of-the-art polymer electrolytes. Approaches to be used for synthesis of these two materials will be based upon, (i) the modification of polycarbonate hosts by poly(dimethyl siloxane) and multifunctional silanes, and (ii) introducing cyclic carbonates into poly(dimethyl siloxane) matrix. Both of these related strategies exploit the idea that carbonate oxygens, within the single phase carbonate-siloxane polymer matrix, will facilitate extensive ionic dissociation of introduced lithium salts, and that furthermore elastomeric behavior of the matrix under ambient temperature conditions will lead to enhanced mobility of lithium ions. This would permit small inter-electrode distances to be achieved within portable secondary lithium batteries incorporating these new polymer electrolytes. Following verification of high lithium ion conductivity in these polymeric materials and their elastomeric phase under ambient or close to ambient temperature, they will be incorporated into lithium cells and their reversible electrochemical performance evaluated.  BENEFITS:  A new class of lithium ion conducting polymer electrolytes to emerge from this investigation, possessing both ionic conductivities 10(-3) S/cm and improved elastomeric properties compared to currently available technology, will find commercial application in high performance portable secondary lithium batteries.  Performance of these devices is currently limited by inadequate combinations of ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability, that will be resolved in this program.",

        "abstract": "Superconducting rotating machinery has been proposed as a means of achieving greater efficiency in electrical power generation and utilization. Furthermore, superconducting generators and motors have the potential to be more compact thereby increasing the flexibility of system designs as well as potentially reducing manufacturing costs. However, commercialization of this technology is gated by the availability of affordable, reliable cooling systems needed to maintain the superconductor at low temperatures. Energen, Inc. proposes to design and demonstrate a Stirling cycle cryocooler that can be shaft-mounted to provide cooling to the rotating field windings of synchronous generators and motors. The single-stage cryocooler will provide 10 W cooling capacity at 77 K and use many off-the-shelf components to maintain affordability.",

Plizga, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG03-98ER82573\nAmount:  $75,000\n\nAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs National Sewage Sludge Survey, approximately 7.8 million tons of sewage sludge (dry basis) are generated each year in the U.S. as a byproduct of municipal wastewater treatment.  Management of sewage sludge is a growing concern due to the increasing volumes of sludge, demand for lower pollutant discharges, and rise in disposal costs.  This project will develop technology for converting sewage sludge into a high-quality and low-cost pumpable slurry fuel.  The slurry fuel can be utilized for cofiring or reburning in coal-fired utility boilers, with greatly reduced emissions compared to sludge incinerators.  Phase I is a feasibility study for producing and utilizing economical marketable fuels from sewage sludge.  Phase I objectives include 1) converting sewage sludge to a pumpable slurry fuel with an increased heating value, 2) determining fuel characteristics of the carbonized sewage sludge, 3) defining combustion generated emissions and ash characteristics, and 4) evaluating cofiring and reburning as potential application of the new fuel.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  This project would establish the combustion of carbonized sewage sludge as an economically and environmentally desirable method of disposal and utilization.  The U.S. market for carbonized sewage sludge fuel is estimated to be approximately $1.3 billion per year.  Preliminary economic estimates demonstrate that the technology would be extremely competitive in most geographic regions of the United States._",

Wastes generated from glass bead abrasive blasting  operations contain heavy metals and other constituents which can result in a  hazardous waste classification.  The work outlined here proposes to utilize the  glass bead wastes as a raw material in a process to reduce and react heavy  metals wastes, forming marketable ferroalloys.  This process would be fueled  by a waste solid fuel material, and the process would yield a non-hazardous  by-product which could be used in the construction industry as structural fill.   Conventional modular equipment can be employed in this processing scenario.   A successful test program as outlined in this proposal would provide an  economical alternative to hazardous waste treatment and eliminate the  liabilities and costs associated with hazardous waste disposal. This Phase I work will be directed to establishing the conditions necessary to  utilize the glass bead wastes in the reduction and reaction of the metal  compounds and effect their separation from the heavy metal waste materials.   Phase II would proceed to a pilot scale melter, with particular attention to  melter design.",

This project develops lightweight and compact beam dumps that are suited for flight as well as for terrestrial applications where dumps are rapidly moved into the beam. The design concept uses an innovative absorber coating that reduces the need for bulky cavities. High enthalpy materials are used for passive thermal control to eliminate the need for active cooling. Faster thermal recovery is anticipated. Phase l will fabricate and test materials coupons to investigate concept feasibility, materials will be offered for high power testing at outside laboratories, and a subscale demonstration component will be fabricated.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase I proposal is aimed at increasing power density, enhancing modularity, and reducing cost through the use of Pulse Detonation Engines (PDEs).  The proposed propulsion system is based on a new engine concept that provides higher specific impulse than rockets or tubojets.  It is more efficient than conventional engines because of its constant-volume, nonsteady operating cycle and has no moving parts in the power productin section.  In PDEs a detonation wave is initiated in a mixture of aspirated air and fuel and propagates axially in the detonation chamber.  Thurst is generated when the wave impinges on the thrust wall.  The use of multiple chambers allows thrust vectoring and enhances engine reliability and efficiency.  PDEs are more efficient than tubojets at small scale, require no exotic materials, and are less expensive to build.  Their structural efficiency is greater than that of IC engines and they can operate at higher speeds.  They avoid the power density limitations of electric power generation and the low specific impulse of solid propellants, and can incorporate thrust vectoring and thrust level control, which enhances maneuverability.  We will develop and demonstrate a low-cost air-breathing propulsion system that can be used for existing systems and adapted to future advanced programs.",

Several groups of naturally-occurring bacteria are capable of co-metabolically degrading chlorinated solvents while growing on different co-substrates such as methane, propane and butane.  During this project we will perform laboratory studies to address the use of multiple co-substrates to simultaneously stimulate multiple groups of chlorinated solvent-degrading microorganisms.  Initial experiments will be performed in laboratory aquifer microcosms that will allow careful measurements of chlorinated solvent degradation and the calculation of a mass balance of the amount of solvent and growth substrate added to the microcosms and degraded by the natural microbial propulations.  Trichloroethylene (TCE) will serve as a test chlorinated solent, and its degradation kinetics will be fitted to currently-available co-metabolic degradation models.  Growth of different microbial populations in response to co-substrate feeding will be measured to address the feasibility of stimulating  multiple degradative populations.  Experiments will be performed to select the best combination of co-substrates and to optimize co-substrate feeding regimes to maximize chlorinated solvent degradation, and develop an efficient and cost-effective in situ bioremediation technology.

The objectives of the research are to:  (1) determine if bacteria that degrade paint emissions can co-exist in a biofilter with bacteria that degrade methylene chloride such that sustained simultaneous degradation of methylene chloride and paint emissions can be accomplished; (2) develop a method to adequately control biofilter bed pH during treatment of methylene chloride vapors; and (3) determine biofilter performance at both high and low influent contaminant concentrations.  The high concentration for each contaminant will be the 8-hour OSHA exposure limit for that particular target.  At each influent concentration, biofilter performance will be evaluated at two different vapor contact times.  The pH of biofilter packing is usually controlled by the addition of calcium carbonate to the packing material.

        "abstract": "Thermophotovoltaic (TPV) electrical generation is a technology well-suited to the development of highly efficient, compact, lightweight, and reliable sources of electricity. Tn TPV electrical generation, heat generated by combustion is converted to radiant energy by an emitting surface, then to electrical energy by a photovoltaic (PV) cell. The bandgap of the PV cell is tailored to convert the bulk of the infrared (IR) spectrum being emitted.  Making the spectrum more monochromatic leads to higher electrical conversion efficiencies; therefore, filtering elements are placed between the emitter and cells to reflect out-of-band radiation back to the combustor for recycling.  Theoretically, TPV electrical generation can exceed 35%.  Importantly.  TPV generators are totally static; with no moving parts they produce no noise or vibration and can be highly reliable.  Essential Research, Inc., teaming with Teledyne Brown Engineering-Energy Systems, propose to develop a rugged TPV power supply to meet the operational requirements requested in the Army SBIR solicitation:  person-portable, 200 W output power, and utilizing liquid, logistic fuels.  Our technical approach is to develop a combustor that heats a graybody SiC emitter to moderate temperature (1500 K) .  The IR radiation is tailored with a shortpass filter that reflects the near out-of-band radiation back to the combustor for recycling. The in-band radiation is converted to electricity with narrow-bandgap PV cells made from InGaAs deposited on InP.  BENEFITS:  We plan to prototype a 200 w, man-portable battery charger at the end of Phase II.  The unit will be capable of generating electricity from burning tactical, liquid military fuels. The unit will have use in the military as a reliable, silent battery charger and remote power generator.  Commercial applications include recreational boating and camping, and off-grid power generation.",

        "abstract": "Currently, tandem solar cells are used for high-performance space power generation and achieve conversion efficiencies approaching 25%.  Relative to single-cell technology, the higher production costs of tandem cells are more than offset by their higher efficiency, and consequential reduction in array size and weight.  The traditional tandem cell design is far from optimal, however.  The bandgaps for the top and bottom cells are chosen to avoid growing lattice-mismatched epitaxial layers, instead of for achieving ultimate conversion efficiencies.  We have demonstrated a buffer-layer scheme that enables InGaAs mismatched layers to be grown on GaAs without electrical degradation.  By so doing, we can for the first time, grow dislocation-free tandem cells with optimized bandgaps.  We propose the development of an ultra-high efficiency triple-junction concentrator cell.  The structure of this new tandem solar cell will be:  InAlP top cell, InGaP middle cell, and InGaAs bottom cell.  It will be a monolithic, two terminal device fabricated on an inexpensive and rugged Ge substrate.  The AMO efficiency of this cell under 10-100X ratios is projected to be approximately 40%.  Because the growth and fabrication procedures for this cell will be identical to the commercially available InGaP2/GaAs-on-Ge tandem cells, it will be a commercially viable product.",

The proposed program will leverage this skill of the principals and the considerable commercial advantages of an independent route to substrate fabrication and teaming with a major manufacturer of superconducting wire and devices.  The program will utilize improved technology for very large-area pulsed-laser deposition (PLD) of films and novel ion-beam methods for surface smoothing prior to film deposition.

However, the development of large FPAs has been seriously impeded by the limited size of commercially available Cd(1-x)Zn(x)Te substrates and in the current hybrid technology by the thermal expansion mismatch between HgCdTe detector array and Si readout.  In this project, we propose to explore the development of a monolithically integrated HgCdTe megapixel IRFPA High quality (defect density less than 5x10(5) cm(-2)) (211)B Cd(1-x)Zn(x)Te epitaxial layers will be grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on 3-inch Si(211) substrates.

A particular attention will be given to the temperature during the entire growth and fabrication process which should not exceed the maximum temperature allowed for a Si readout circuit. In order to evaluate the feasibility of the monolithic concept, localized epitaxy of CdTe on Si substrates will be explored.

Compared to GaSb and quaternary InGaAsSb, InP and InGaAs offer many critical advantages; (l)the existence of semi-insulating InP substrate enabling MIMs development(GaSb does not have semi-insulating form), and (2)proven high temperature reliability of InGaAs. The reliability of the meta-stable quaternaly InGaAsSb at high TPV operating environment is a concern, due to a large miscibility gap, and the ability to use InGaAsSb/GaSb materials in the MIMs is not proven yet. However, the performance of 0.55 ev InGaAs/InP TPV cell is still inferior than dislocation free 0.74 ev lattice-matched InGaAs/lnP cell due to the high density of mismatch generated threading dislocations.  ELI proposes a novel approach to incorporate a new composition graded buffer layer (CGBL) to reduce/eliminate the threading dislocation and dramatically improve the performance of 0.55 ev InGaAs/InP TPV cells and MIMs. In phase I, design and growth of the novel buffers will be carried out, and improved TPV will be demonstrated.

The proposed research will define the preliminary pump concept, determine its feasibility, and define its requirements including the environment in which it must perform.  An integrated numerical model of the TERFENOL-D transducers, pump, valves, and fluid volumes will be developed to predict performance.

The concept results in a laser and detection system with a total weight with batteries of less than 4 ounces each for the micro-transmitter and the miniaturized detection system. Using novel, state of the art laser modeling codes to support our design, we have quantified a range of options for the transmitter and system design.  From this we selected a compact, diode pumped Nd laser plus OPO for our concept.  Our proposed effort will combine engineering design, laser modeling and breadboard experiments to arrive at an optimum approach for Phase II.  The concept features a novel optical parametric oscillator cavity. Low thresholds and over 120microJ outputs are predicted.  The predicted pulse durations are under 5ns, ideal for ranging.  For the same drive diode power, the conventional OPO cavity is closer to threshold and produces considerably less power.  Breadboard experiments will be used to understand the range of operation for both cavities. The critical interfaces and design options for mating the sensor to the host system will be identified in Phase I.

The process is based on non-obvious improvements to both the process (batch continuous) and chemistry (improved sensitization).  The proposed Phase I process is designed to provide multigrams of quadricyclane per hour at >99% purity for a demonstration of the technology and will include the production of samples for further testing and evaluation by the DoD.  The process will (1) utilize a sensitizer with an absorption band that more optimally matches the emission from a high efficiency UV source than sensitizers previously used, and (2) will implement a system that efficiently shifts short wavelength UV light for optimal throughput and efficiency.  A continuous-flow purification process will yield high final product purity at the lowest possible cost.  The proposed reactor is a scaled version of a pilot plant design that would produce 1-2 pounds of quadricyclane per hour per stage.

A rapid growth area for composite materials is for the next generation of missile systems where composites provide significant advantages.  Lightweight, high-strength composite structures provide increased velocity and enhanced maneuverability.  Composites respond less violently to hazardous stimuli, and thus pose less risk in transportation and storage.  However, the use of composite materials has not come without both processing difficulties and cost.  To overcome these deficiencies, R&S, in conjunction with Virginia Tech, proposes to design, analyze, fabricate, and test novel, low-cost functionally graded composite structures for a multitude of applications.  Researchers at Virginia Tech have developed novel processing methods using thermoplastic liquid crystal polymer (TLCP)reinforcement fibers that enable extrusion of composite fiber in a simple, rapid fabrication approach.  Processes have been developed for generating both layered materials which have different functionalities and microcomposite materials based on thermoplastics reinforced with micron size TLCP fibrils (1).

        "abstract": "At the present time, steel containers are used for packaging munitions in the majority of cases.  The problems with steel containers are that they are heavy, and that they will contain gases from burning propellants because the propellants cannot burn through the steel before trapped gases cause an explosion.  Alternate materials have been considered, including aluminum and composites, but each has its own drawbacks.  We propose to solve this problem by modifying a manufacturing process based on microcomposite materials.  F&S and its research partners have been working on the development of novel materials and manufacturing methods incorporating tailored material properties using the microcomposite process, wherein small particles of various materials can be preprocessed with high performance polymers to manufacture components in net shape or near-net shape.  The properties of the resulting component depend on the combination of the properties of the processed powders used in their fabrication and on the properties and amount of polymer binder used.  By building on this demonstrated performance, and then developing methods to scale the process up to larger components, the F&S development team will be able to produce larger tailored components for military munitions packaging as well as other commercial applications.

A more generic simulation tool incorporating a graphical user interface is needed to allow system engineers to quickly and accurately design fiber optic systems.  We propose to develop a dual-use software system based on LabView, a popular simulation and virtual instrument software package.  LabView is capable of simulating all the necessary functions for designing fiber optic communication systems.  The advantages of this approach are that the software is already supported by National Instruments and widely used in both industry and academic environments, it has a well-known and easy to use graphical interface, and finally the simulation tool can also be used as an analytical instrument for verifying performance of the simulated system  after it has been constructed.",

To produce such corrosion resistive coatings, we will fabricate high performance polymers and inorganic oxide particles using unique chemical processing techniques, and then form them into thick multi-layer thin-film coatings.  F&S and their two subcontractors have demonstrated both of these methods through prior research programs.  Judicious selection of inorganic oxide and noble metal particle species, precise control of particle size and orientation, and multi-layer formation allows graded tailoring of the surface hardness and corrosion resistance of the coated surface.  The proposed self-assembly process allows the rapid multi-layer thick-film build-up to thousands of individual layers and micros of total thickness at room temperature and pressure, and totally avoids use of volatile organic compounds.  During the Phase I program, F & S will design coating properties, select nanoparticles, self-assemble designed coatings, and evaluate properties with respect to design goals.  Litton and Virginia Tech will assist with corrosion test article evaluation and analysis of production upscaling methods.  Commercialization cost-sharing by F&S is pledged.",

This study proposes a systematic approach to address the fundamental chemical kinetics of the cold start problem in compression ignition engines and yield a turn-key starting aid module which could be added to an existing diesel engine.  There are four fundamental ways to improve the kinetics of combustion processes: (1) increase the system temperature; (2) use a catalyst; (3) use more reactive fuel components; and (4) increase the oxygen supply.  The proposed appproach involves technology that impacts three of these principal components of the combustion process, that is (a) enhancement of the ignition process using catalytic glow plugs, (b) in-situ enhancement of the existing fuel to produce more volatile fractions, and (c) in-situ oxygen enrichment during cold starts.  These processes will not be studied independently, but as pieces of one process to improve the overall combustion kinetics during cold starts.  BENEFITS:  Improved performance and energy efficiency of diesel direct injection engines in cold conditions.  This module can be used on military or commercial diesel engines.",

        "abstract": "The problem of mine detection and location is particularly difficult when the mines are built from a plastic or dielectric material.  Metal detectors are able to detect metal mines, but plastic mines blend in very well with the background soil and rocks.  A promising approach for detecting plastic mines is the use of Ultra-Wideband (UWB) radar.  In this project we will explore and develop methods to identify the location of a mine, and to discriminate it from its background. Ther are two methods one might use to identify and locate plastic mines.  First, when excited by a UWB pulse, a mine will resonate at one or more of its characteristic frequencies.  These radiated characteristic frequencies can be extracted from the scattered field using the matrix pencil technique.  Second, one can use polarization diversity to discriminate between rocks and mines.  It has been shown that regularly shaped objects such as mines can radiate no cross-polarized signal.  In contrast, various natural objects such as rocksare asymmetrical, and will in fact radiate a cross-polarized signal.  By employing one or both of these techniques one can hope to solve the most difficult problems in mine location.During Phase I we will design a UWB radar system that will capable of locating and identifying a plastic mine.  We will set up a simple system using low voltage electronics and available equipment.  We will extract poles using the matrix pencil technique and we will compare the extracted poles to existing theory.  We will explore polarization diversity, by considering measuring both polarizations.",

At present there is no existing technique, commercial or otherwise, for non-destructive pulse-to-pulse emittance measurement.  Currently, the only working technique for high energy electron beams employs wire-scanners, requiring multiple machine pulses (large beam-time requirement for tune-up) and large capital cost ($100K per scanner for 8 scanners).  In addition, these systems are mechanically fragile, necessitating continual maintenance.  A cavity-based technique has been conceived permitting measurement of beam quadrupole moments, on a single-pulse, without beam interception, and without moving parts.  This project will produce a working design for a pulse-to-pulse emittance measurement system, including beam optics analysis, and designs for the magnetic lattice and the resonant cavity.  In Phase II, a prototype cavity will be fabricated, bench-tested, and tested with beam.\nPhase I will provide analysis of the systematics of the cavity pickup (common-mode, misalignments, electronics), electromagnetic modeling of the cavity and design structure dimensions (cavity & couplers).  A conceptual design will be produced including the magnetic lattice and cavity placement on the beamline.  This emittance measurement system will be analyzed accounting for magnetic lattice and cavity-derived systematic errors, to determine figures of merit for achievable beam-size, and emittance resolution.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  This technique for in-line, non-destructive, pulse-to-pulse, measurement of beam emittance can be applied to all particle accelerators where maintaining beam quality is crucial, from high energy physics accelerators to medical application accelerators.  This system can offer superior functionality (pulse-to-pulse resolution) and much lower cost (a factor of ten or more) than the presently available wire scanner systems._",

This new organic material is expected to outperform the current state-of-the-art organic optoelectronic materials by virtue of its unique molecular structure featuring a double chain design.  This work is specifically undertaken to develop a highly robust, thermally and electronically stable organic material required to construct electrically pumped thin film solid state lasers and high brightness organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays.  In this Phase 1 project we will develop appropriate synthetic methodology to prepare a novel conjugated organic polymer. The new material will be evaluated by integration into OLED test structures to measure I-V characteristics, luminance efficiency, and durability under high excitation conditions.  During Phase 2 related derivatives of the new organic compound incorporating donor and acceptor groups along the polymer backbone will be developed to allow band gap control for color options.",

        "abstract": "Ram air paragliders offer the advantage of relatively safe and quiet insertion of cargo that can be remotely guided to within 100 meters of the target point. Fabrication of cargo ram air parafoils however involves cumbersome cut-and-sew processes which is labor intensive leading to high cost. Weaving the ram air parafoil fabric in Net Shape Three Dimensions (NS3D) will eliminate the labor intensive cut-and-sew method.  Two methods will be investigated and the best method will be used for the deliverable.  Current parafoils are made of non-porous materials with ribs cut and sewn into the top and bottom of the canopy forming cells, into which the air flows. Moving through the air, filling each cell in the parafoil creates lift.  This mechanism forms an aerodynamic wing-like structure.  The cut and sewing process can be replaced however by other structural designs which can be manufactured cheaper and can carry heavier loads.  One such design is a series of arched and tapered tubes sandwiched on the top and bottom with flat woven material. The real challenge in the airfoil project is creating an arched and tapered tube that contains no seams. Arched tubes are fairly routine in practice using NS3D weaving.  However, weaving of the tapered tube requires more research for perfecting the technique (Fig. 1). FFF has the necessary technology and skill in order to successfully complete the task.  BENEFITS:  In addition to military and sport paragliders, this structure can be rigidized.  The rigid parafoil form can be used to construct wings for military and sport gliders as well as motorized aircraft that are either heavier or lighter then air. For the same reasons that such structure can be used in an efficient aircraft, it can be used for watercraft structures as well. This can be accomplished by fitting the hydro surface with structural beams-ribs.",

        "abstract": "Other than prevention the only way to deal with an explosive threat is to place a blast mitigation barricade between the threat and the structure(s) that need to be protected.  Only after the barricade is in place can the threat be moved, disabled, or safely detonated.  It is desirable that the barricade be portable and thus it needs to be light weight, compact, and easily manipulated by two to three individuals.  Unfortunately a light weight, compact and easily moved barrier will not mitigate a blast from 100-150 kg of high explosive very well.  Ideally what is needed is a light weight, compact and easily manipulated barrier that after being put in place can be altered to produce a heavy, large, and immobile blast barrier, energy absorber, or blast (shock wave) deflector. Federal fabrics-Fibers Inc. (FFF) has produced prototype products that exactly meet these specific requirements.  These barricades weigh 20-40 lbs, when empty, so they are easy to manipulate during the early stages of development, when they are put into place.  After positioning the barricade they are filled, preferably with water, or gel, from a convenient source to produce barricades that can weigh in excess of 25 tons.",

This project will develop the Short-pulse Plasma Implantation/Coating (SPIC) process.  This process is a unique combination of high energy ion implantation and hard coating deposition which will extend die lifetime by more than a factor of ten by reducing cracking, corrosion, and wear.  In Phase I, the basic feasibility of the SPIC concept will be demonstrated by: (1) assembling a SPIC experiment; (2) performing tests to demonstrate the efficacy of the SPIC concept; and (3) developing a conceptual design for a laboratory prototype system.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  If successful, the market for processing of such dies would be very large.  Other applications include tools, stamping dies, bearings, and gears.\n_",

This project will address the wide gap that exists between the theoretical and actual cell efficiency, interdiffusion between the active layers, elevated-resistance and questionable stability of the back contacts, complex and time-consuming methods of post-treatment of the layers, and lack of compatibility of the processes that hampers high-throughput manufacture.  The main goal is to develop materials and processes for an innovative, high-throughput manufacturing process for high-performance, low-cost, photovoltaic devices for large-scale applications.  The specific objectives are to close the gap between the theoretical and observed cell efficiency by developing deposition processes for improved active layers, contact materials, and dry methods of post treatment.  Physical and chemical vapor deposition processes for improved alloy absorber and dopant layers will be developed to minimize interface diffusion and contact resistance.  New film deposition and post-treatment methods developed will be compatible with the high-throughput process environment.   Fabricated films and devices will be tested to ascertain their performance and long-term stability. \n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   Low-cost, photovoltaic arrays will be used in grid and distributed power systems worldwide in residential buildings, communications, parking garages, water purification and water pumping.  _",

Utilizing self-propagating, high-temperature synthesis (SHS) techniques, functionally-graded property, gun barrel/liner production methods will be identified and tube samples fabricated which eliminate current ceramic or refractory metal liner interfacial, thermal/mechanical failure mechanisms. The methodology may have the potential to produce a complete monolithic gun barrel structure exhibiting transitional material property changes from bore-to-barrel.  The specific technical objective of Phase I indude: (1) identification of materials and processing techniques consistent with SHS processing capabilities which span the thermal/mechanical performance requirements from the bore to the barrel as a single, composite matrix structure (i.e. functionally-graded material), (2) design and build the necessary SHS processing support hardware to demonstrate fabrication of tube-like samples with an overall objective of producing up to 150 mm diameter tube segments for subsequent material property evaluation, (3) perform base-line, thermal/mechanical tests on the samples to verify the extent to which functional-gradation has been achieved, and (4) define advanced property and material performance test methods consistent with functionally-graded materials and in an appropriately-simulated in-bore environment.  BENEFITS:  Benefits include material process development for gun barrels and liners which may substantially improve the life-cycle economics for the Army on these important components.

The major obstacle to clinically viable BNCT is that effective therapy requires the selective localization of 5-30 ppm boron-10 in a tumor.  Evidence has shown that boron-rich oligomeric phosphate diesters are selectively concentrated in tumor tissue, but available synthetic methods cannot produce sufficient material for needed testing.    This project will develop synthetic methods suitable for larger scale production.  Methods for sequential linking of boron-rich substrates with phosphate groups that do not rely on polymeric anchors will be studied.  The methods developed would be useful for producing the gram quantities that needed immediately and will ultimately be useful for larger scale manufacturing of the product.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: In addition to their prospects for providing a general cancer therapy, the oligomers also should have potential as antisense agents against viral diseases._",

An existing electron beam source will be modified to achieve the required energy density for surface modification.

Photocathodes are limited to a few pulses and are constrained by materials that suffer from performance, reliability, and robustness issues.  They also require expensive high-power lasers, are restricted in repetition rate, and require complicated timing circuitry.  This project will develop a new device called the gated micro-pulse gun which is not pulse-limited.  A point design, verified by simulations, has demonstrated 50 to 100 electron bunches of 40 nano-coulombs of charge, a micro-pulse duration of 15-20 picoseconds, a normalized transverse emittance of about 20 millimeters-milliradians, and a particle energy of 0.1 million electron volts.

Guzdar, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG02-98ER82584\nAmount:  $74,984\n\nEfficient conversion of highly variable wind power to mechanical power in the form of pumping water can be accomplished at remote sites through the innovative use of advanced electronic control systems.  However, existing control systems require a battery back-up which loses its charge over time, and variable speed wind conditions degrade the efficiency of energy conversion.  The elimination of batteries required for control power would dramatically increase system reliability.  The use of induction machines for both generator and motor could provide a very robust conversion from wind-to-electrical-to-mechanical power.  Induction machines are well understood, rugged, and inexpensive.  Isolated, self-excited induction generator applications, however, have lagged due to a perceived difficulty of control.  Recent approaches to induction machine control have yielded two-fold advantages:  assured generation of electrical power and precise generator and motor control.  This project will produce an optimized controller with very high reliability and availability with the capability of pumping the maximum volume of water at any wind speed.   In Phase I, the design of the generator and motor controller will be performed, and a proof-of-concept breadboard demonstration unit will be designed, fabricated, and tested. \n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   The ability to pump water utilizing wind power will make land use economical in locations where electric service is presently unavailable.  This will be true for a remote village or isolated grid system.  Remote power supply is a rapidly growing application of power electronics.  Rural locations within the United States and in developing countries need this type of capability.  Although optimized for water pumping applications, other uses of the electrical energy (such as water processing and purification) are likely._",

        "abstract": "The following proposal will examine the concept of directing a fleet of mobile mines to establish a mixed field in remote areas.  It will leverage our work on the canister-launched mines, man-in-the-loop mines (TNM-APLA), non-lethal mines and Lemmings.  While mines seem like a simple weapon, our work in mine design has shown that a very thorough systems analysis is required to make them so.  The systems approach will be even more important in the mobile mine application.  Our work with the original Lemmings has also taught us where many of the issues lie.  While Lemmings is a counter-mine robot, it contains all of the essential elements (including explosives and fuzing) that make it a mobile mine.  The Lemmings is not size optimized and the requirement to recover the mines after hostilities adds new and not insignificant challenges.  The program will test several concepts.  A system trade-off will be performed to assess the volume and weight overhead associated with locomotion in terms of batteries, motors, wheels/tracks, controllers, etc.  We will determine the limits of practical mine shrinkage and contrast it against a concept where a robot lays and later performs a pick up and carry away (PUCA) operation.  We will explore different methods of creating a spread pattern representing the typical 'A' patterns.  It will also explore other patterns which are not possible when hand laid fields are employed.",

This is expected to produce flows that may be single-phase liquid or a two-phase mixture of liquid and vapor.  Handling, monitoring, and controlling such flows is far more complicated than in single-phase flows at conventional temperatures, necessitating the development of special flow instrumentation.  In the proposed program, we will pursue the development of an advanced flow measurement system that combines ultrasonic transit-time flow measurement for single-phase conditions with a Foster-Miller technology that uses the irregular dynamics of a sensor signal to determine both the liquid and vapor flows in two-phase flow conditions.  The dynamical analysis method will use either active or passive measurements using the same ultrasonic transducers that are used for the single-phase transit-time measurement.Phase I will demonstrate the feasibility of the program concept through laboratory testing of the active and passive sensing approaches in fuel-air flows at room temperature.

It has been used successfully to produce several such structures, eliminating or minimizing problems such as fiber waviness (or marcelling), fiber shifting, resin migration, disbonds and voids.  Currently, however, successful use of this technique for thick parts depends upon repeated debulking during fiber placement, and a lengthy autoclave cure cycle is required after fiber placement is completed.  Foster-Miller proposes to modify commercial thermoplastic toughened prepreg tape to eliminate these debulking and autoclave cure requirements.  A combination of staging, preconsolidation and creation of a highly reactive surface will be employed to produce a prepreg tape capable of full in-situ cure during fiber placement.  Foster-Miller has formed a team with aircraft primes Bell Helicopter and Lockheed Martin to realize development of this low cost fabrication process.

        "abstract": "This program will develop a high performance flat braided tension member for cargo handling hoists on the Army's CH47 Advanced cargo Aircraft (ACA).  The development of much thinner tape, made possible by use of high strength liquid crystal polymer, PBO, will increase the available tension member length, offering greater stand off capability.  Alternatively, the thinner tape will enable a smaller diameter winch, thus further reducing the hoist system weight.  Foster-Miller will use a unique flat braiding process to produce a flat tape that will support an 18,000 lb. load with a safety factor of 5:1.  The flat braid will greatly reduce the transverse expansion of the tape when wound on the drum under a load.  Flat braiding will allow the needed electrical wires to be integrated into the tape and still be thinner than the current tape.  Foster-Miller will work closely with Breeze Eastern Inc. who is considered the leader in hoist development for helicopters.  The Phase I program will develop braid design and result in fabrication and preliminary testing of braided tape.  Testing will include fatigue tests around a simulated winch.  A Phase II program is anticipated to produce a 100 ft. length of tape that can be installed on an aircraft hoist system and tested.  Foster-Miller will work closely with Breeze Eastern, Inc. to develop a tape that can be integrated into their current tape hoist system.  A lighter, more robust tape and hoist system is anticipated as the Phase II program result.

While significant advances have recently been accomplished in remote spectral sensing using rugged FTIRs with point detectors, efforts towards spatial chemical discrimination have been lacking.  Foster-Miller, Inc. (FMI) together with Boeing/Rockwell Electro-Optic Center proposes to design and demonstrate a radically different mid-infrared (3-5um) and long wave IR (8-12 um) imaging spectrometer for standoff detection of chemical warfare agents and other molecular species.  This no moving parts device will:  Be readily incorporated into existing or planned FLIR's; Eliminate the cost, complexity, reliability and bandwidth/resolution problems associated with either Fabry Perot or Michelson Interferometer based approaches currently under consideration; Given the small size and performance insensitivity to on-board vibration, high EMI, thermal variations, the proposed optic would easily adapt cryocooling and field deployable requirements for low radiance detection.  During the Phase I effort, will demonstrate overall feasibility, determine spectral and spatial resolution and compute NESR and NETD for the system.  Our team partner Boeing/Rockwell Electro-Optic Center will provide a cryogenically cooled detector array to be coupled to spectrometer to demonstrate the feasibility of our design approach.  The Phase I will provide the basis for the creation of a conceptual design of an integrated FLIR imaging and spectral radiometer for development during Phase II.  During Phase II FMI and Boeing/Rockwell will optimize the system design to incorporate higher spatial resolution and light collection optics integrated with a cooled detector array and deliver a well characterized prototype system to the topic sponsor.

        "abstract": "As a part of the Integrated High Performance Turbine Engine Technology (IHPTET) program, the Joint Turbine Advanced Gas Generator (JTAGG) program aims to revolutionize aircraft propulsion performance and operational capability by decreasing specific fuel consumption by 40%. and increase power-to-weight by 120%.  In order to accomplish these goals, higher operating temperatures must be achieved through the incorporation of ceramic matrix composites (CMC's) into turbine components.  Foster-Miller has previously proven the ability to braid net shape airfoils with ceramic fibers, for low pressure turbine components for jet aircraft engines.  Foster-Miller proposes to further develop this technology by addressing the miniaturization issues which will be encountered to fabricate a turbine nozzle guide vane for the JTAGG engine, while optimizing the airfoil-to-platform strength for the integrally braided preforms.  In cooperation with our Phase I partner, GE Aircraft Engines, Foster-Miller has developed a technology development plan for all related CMC turbine components.  Successful development of this technology will result in low cost, high performance parts which can be incorporated into future generation engines.  This technology will not only benefit the JTAGG engine program, but will also provide essential data and technology to feed into related engine programs for the Navy, Air Force, NASA, and Army.  BENEFITS:  Advancing and miniaturizing the technology to braid high temperature materials with complex geometry will be developed to meet the needs of the IHPTET program and GE Aircraft Engines, a leading manufacturer of the future generation engines.  The nozzle guide vanes in gas turbine engines have been identified as the ideal first implementation location.  The preforming technology will be applicable to all future turbine applications.  These preforming technologies are critical to the incorporation of high temperature materials into complex, highly loaded geometries.",

Current ice density determinations use mass volume techniques and submersion techniques on ice core samples.  A Phase I effort, to determine the feasibility of accurately measuring ice density with a nuclear and a membrane method, is proposed.  The nuclear method is currently used throughout the United States to measure soil density and moisture content at earthwork construction sites.  The nuclear method has been demonstrated for ice density (and salinity) measurement on a limited basis in the former Soviet Union.  The membrane method improves the accuracy of determining volumes (a major source of error) by the proven mass-volume technique.  Phase I will apply these technologies to benchtop ice density measurement.  Benchmark ice specimens will be used to evaluate the accuracy and repeatability of the two techniques.

Foster-Miller proposes to develop a tailored metal matrix composite (MMC) track shoe/pin component that will match the wear and strength performance of the current steel shoe at less than half its weight.  Further, our MMC fabrication method (pressure casting) uses low cost nonstructural tooling, achieves net shape parts and is scaleable, which will produce high performance and cost-effective components.  The Foster-Miller team will include a major foundary who is responsible for the design of track components for the AAAV, and a targeted component producer (beyond Phase II).  In Phase I, Foster-Miller will produce MMC specimens for mechanical and tribological testing, and a scaled                                                            pability.

Adhesives that are storage-stable at ambient temperature for one to two years but process and cure at low temperatures are needed to economically utilize bonded repair technology on aircraft.

The cured adhesive will meet MIL-A-25463B requirements and will have lower life cycle costs compared to currently available film adhesives.  In Phase I, we will examine two approaches to producing a one-part, shelf-stable, 200F cure epoxy film adhesive that is ideal for on-aircraft bonded repair.  The one part adhesive developed in the proposed program will require no metering or mixing, a desirable feature that will eliminate problems associated with improperly formulated adhesives.  In Phase I, we will demonstrate feasibility of achieving target adhesive shelf-stability, reactivity and performance using an epoxy paste adhesive.

In addition, conventional tape wrap methods for fabrication have been successful to obtain the required component strengths.  However, with the current lack of a domestic rayon supply, a low-cost replacement is desperately needed.  Foster-Miller has previously demonstrated a low-cost fabrication technique for tape-wrapped rocket nozzle components.  This method of in-situ braiding and nozzle wrapping has successfully achieved the high performance and low-cost requirements for such applications.  As an adjunct to this technology, Foster-Miller proposes expand the braiding process to include the capability to create hybrid flat tape.  This triaxial braid will have carbon bias fibers on one side of the braid, and glass bias on the other, with the two fibers interlocked at the interface.  The system will tailor the thermal conductivity so that the material system has the carbon's ablation resistance with the glass insulation capabilities, while maintaining the structural performance requirements.  Foster-Miller's Phase I teaming partner, Thiokol Corporation, is eager for the development of such a low-cost process for current rocket nozzle exit cone applications.

The recent National Research Council (NRC) study on technology needs for the 21st century (1) specifically cites the use of composite materials for signature reduction as one of the three primary development recommendations for Navy platforms.  However, flammability/smoke/toxicity (FST) concerns have long hindered the implementation of composite structures into Navy warships and US commercial vessels.  In the proposed Phase I program, Foster-Miller will evaluate and develop several options for co-infusion of two distinct resin systems into a single composite structure.  A central performance goal of each of these options will be to provide the necessary fire barrier as an integral part of a composite structure while also yielding suitable structural performance and low manufacturing costs.  Foster-Miller has previously demonstrated a unique intumescent composite matrix resin that provides improved fire barrier performance over standard phenolic resin systems.  This resin system will be evaluated in the proposed program as one of the co-infusion resin systems.  The proposed program will evaluate these options against the necessary performance specifications identified by Foster Miller and our team members Bath Iron Works and Techmatics.  Following initial evaluation, a minimum of two co-infusion approaches will be carried through testing and evaluation against criteria including fire and structural performance, processability and cost.  The program will culminate in the fabrication and testing of a sub-component to demonstrate the performance of the best approach during the optional phase of the program.",

By utilizing unique braiding techniques to form locking joints from the same composite fibers that comprise the truss tubes, the truss deploys to form a rigid structure with no moving parts.

The thermal loads placed on these personnel may be reduced through the use of microclimate cooling systems.  Unfortunately, to provide effective cooling, such systems must usually make compromises in weight, portability, effectiveness, or comfort.  It is possible to greatly enhance the cooling efficiency of microclimate cooling suits through the use of Thermasorb additives.  Thermasorb additives consist of micro-encapsulated phase-change materials that are capable of absorbing large amounts of heat without changing temperature.  These additives can improve microclimate cooling suits through the use of modular cooling packs or a slurry-based system.  Frisby proposes to design, build, test, and demonstrate three laboratory-scale Thermasorb systems.  A system that incorporates bulk Thermasorb microcapsules in modular units that will absorb heat from a secondary circulating unit, a Thermasorb slurry system that will absorb heat directly from the heat source, and a hybrid (active/passive) system.",

The sensing technique proposed is related to SAR and is called High Range Resolution Radar Low-Order-Tomography (HRRR-LOT).  HRRR-LOT provides a way to extend the useful information content gathered by HRRR sensors by combining, either coherently or noncoherently, a limited number of pulses.  The tactical advantage this affords is three-fold.  It should provide stronger identification performance than standard HRRR and it will decrease the risky flight trajectory constraints required by SAR system in combat scenario.  It gives SAR system another mode to use to ID moving targets.  We will employ existing data from the DARPA MSTAR program to evaluate HRRR-LOT potential in Phase I.  This will lay the ground work for Phase II where the goals are for additional development of a prototype system with Phase III support from JSF.  Sensing is only one side of Combat ID technology.  The other is identification algorithm technology. For this, we intend to investigate Dr. Gustafson's                                              r",

In Phase II, we will write a Commercialization Plan, develop software specifications, develop and test, against a wider variety of test cases, multiple generations of prototype software, and install the latest versions on Air Force computer systems.

This technique will permit radiation tolerant ICs to be binned into groups of differing total dose hardness, rather than being specified at he lowest hardness level in the distribution. Similarly, it would permit a wide variety of commercial (COTS) ICs to be used in both commercial and military space systems in environments in which ionizing radiation would otherwise prevent their use. (The technique was originally proposed in 1995, but was not selected for funding. Since then, experimental data, presented in this proposal, has been obtained that has led FCR to re-submit the concept for consideration as a Phase I program.) The technique does not require that lot traceability be maintained (which is difficult in the commercial world), does not require special test chips ( which may not be available from commercial IC lines), does not degrade he r liability of the device, and is compatible with accepted Hardness Assurance methods.",

Cost reduction by a factor of 100 to 200 relative to rocket launching a full-scale engine is sought.  The proposed approach will leverage off GASL's low-cost, rapid prototyping capabilities for scramjet engines for wind tunnels and for NASA's Hyper-X flight test program, Boeing's prior experience in launching a scramjet from the SHARP gun at LLNL, and prior Army Research Lab personnel in data telemetry from gun-launched munitions.  Essential aspects of the proposed approach are use of closely coordinated CFD and ground-testing to maximize the flight data yield and minimize the risk and cost, and use of a controlled flight environment to permit proper simulation of flight dynamic pressure.  Flight speeds from Mach 6 to 12 are considered within existing ballistic range capabilities.  Mach 8 is the proposed test point since it supports the goals of the HyTech and ARRMD programs.",

This concept, when developed into a portable device used in accordance with a protocol to be developed as part of the proposed program, results in an increase in the ignition delay time of hydrocarbon-based flames by many orders-of-magnitude, effectively self-extinguishing the flame or permitting the use of innocuous, conventional flame-extinguishing methods.   The approach is based on the fact that the kinetic chain mechanism describing the finite-rate oxidation of hydrocarbon-air mixtures can be diverted into slow-reacting side chains by the introduction of water dissociation products, coupled with the use of selective laser radiation to excite the species that divert the kinetic mechanism into the side chains.  As a result, halon 1301 can be replaced by a method involving nothing more than the introduction of water and laser irradiation, perhaps followed by a conventional smothering technique to ensure that no re-ignition of the fire occurs.",

        "abstract": "The technique of screen printing has been demonstrated to be of practical benefit in numerous engineering applications. Over the past two decades, these benefits have been widely recognized by the electronics industry, as evidenced by the flourishing fields of screen-printed thick-film electronics. Multilayer circuits are now manufactured by the sequential deposition of conductive and resistive paste patterns and the deposition of solder bumps and epoxies to secure precisely mounted components. We propose to apply these advanced screen printing methods to large-area opto-electronic applications. In Phase 1, we demonstrated the feasibility of screen printing three-dimensional optical components on a flexible substrate using electroformed stencils, where feasibility was defined as being able to print fine-pitch 3-D optical features of precise dimension, and being able to print a second set of features over the first without damaging either. In Phase 2, we will develop several precision printing techniques required to demonstrate a multilayer device on a flexible polymer substrate for consumer-electronics display applications.",

Ken Wagner, Principal Investigator\nDr. James H. Stanley, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG03-98ER82586\nAmount:  $75,000\n\nAs the number of nodes in a distributed computing environment increases, the cost and efficiency of the data interconnects begin to dominate the system design.  Affordable data links are needed that can transfer large amounts of information at high-speed (~1 Terabit/sec) over distances up to several hundred meters.  A prototypical interconnect comprises a transmitter, a carrier, and a receiver.  This project will develop an interconnect comprising a two-dimensional array of diode lasers (the transmitter), a multilayer stack of polymer waveguides (the carrier), and a two-dimensionalphotodiode sensors (the receiver).  With such an approach, thousands of independent fiberoptic channels of data can be carried over a cable measuring less than 0.3 cm2, resulting in an inexpensive, flexible interconnect.  In Phase I, feasibility will be established by designing and demonstrating:  (1) the dimensional stability of a multi-layer stack of polymer waveguides; and (2) an alignment tolerant scheme for coupling a two-dimensional array of diode lasers to matching arrays of polymer waveguides.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   The proposed massively parallel interconnect promises to lower the price/performance ratio of current optical data interconnects by orders of magnitude.  Applications for such interconnects include large distributed computing environments, clustered parallel computing systems, and datacom switching._",

        "abstract": "Survival rates of human platelets cryopreserved using current methods are very low (10%).  This is largely due to a lack of knowledge regarding the fundamental cryobiology of this cell type.  Because of this limitation, most blood banks maintain platelets in non-frozen solutions.  Using this approach, platelets can only be stored for about 5 days and then they are discarded.  This situation greatly limits the use of platelet transfusion in clinical practice.  In addition, the ability to successfully cryopreserve platelets would allow increased time for disease screening (e.g. HIV, HBV, HCV).  We have found with other cell types that the major limiting factor in the cryopreservation process is the approach (rate) used to add and remove the cryoprotectant solutes to cells.  Therefore, this Phase I project has 3 technical objectives: (1) Determine human platelet cell volume excursion limits (osmotic tolerance limits), (2) Determine platelet plasma membrane permeability coefficients for water and cryoprotectants and their activation energies and (3) Determine optimal methods for addition and removal of cryoprotectants which prevent cell damage.  Using this information, Phase II will focus on development of specific device to facilitate the implementation of optimal platelet cryopreservation in blood banks and for military applications in the field.  BENEFITS:  Platelet survival should be improved using methods developed in this project.  This will provide wider application of human platelet utilization in blood bank and transfusion medicine settings.  In addition, the longer storage times provided by this technology will allow for more complete disease screening of platelet preparations.",

General Reality Corporation (GRC) proposes to attack this bottleneck by advancing the state-of-the-art in structure-from-motion (SFM) algorithms, through integration of edge extraction and aggregation for improved depth mapping, meshing, and object segmentation.  Driven by a Phase II goal of automatically populating the New World Vistas Global Awareness Virtual Test Bed (NWV GA VTB) using video source data, GRC will establish Phase I feasibility by 1) developing a real-time capable, edge-assisted breadboard of its unique               lator                                                                  in a NWV GA VTB visualization, and 3) developing a complete system design for Phase II maturation and delivery.

This suggests that flight control systems must respond to higher level, more intuitive remote commands such as                                                       edded guidance and control processing methods such as those used for autonomously guided cruise missiles or advanced military aircraft demonstrate that low-level stick-and-rudder commands can be eliminated as a requirement on the remote operator.

However, judging the merits of alternate treatment plans from conventional two-dimensional display screens can be difficult.  The problem becomes even more difficult if the entire spatial distribution of the radiation dosage is to be considered, because of the enormous amount of three-dimensional (3D) data that must be evaluated.  The lack of a suitable method for superimposing 3D dose distribution on the relevant anatomy display has greatly contributed to the slow incorporation of 3D techniques into routine radiation treatment planning.  The drawbacks of conventional displays can be largely overcome by employing true volumetric 3D display technology.  That is, each \u00bfvoxel\u00bf in the 3D images locates physically at the (x, y, z) spatial position where it is supposed to be, and emits light from that position to form real 3D images.  Such a system would provide both physiological and psychological depth cues to oncologists, thus providing a unique visualization tool to ensure the safety, effectiveness, and speed of the radiation treatment.  Recently, this state-of-the-art technology has been developed that shows true volumetric 3D images with over 8 million voxels. This project will explore the feasibility of applying this technology as an augmented visualization tool for oncologists to use in selecting radiation treatment plans.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   Applications for the volumetric 3D display range from military related areas (such as battlefield management, air traffic control, submarine navigation, flight trajectory visualization, pilot training, etc.) to consumer products (such as 3D TV, virtual reality, engineering design, games, education, scientific computation, footwear and fashion clothing industry, plastic surgery result validation, orthodontic parameter measurement, and law enforcement applications)._",

        "abstract": "High-speed three-dimensional (3D) imaging of objects and targets is a very important functionality of advanced sensor systems in both military and civilian applications. This capability can provide many BMDO systems with a leapfrog performance advance in target detection, identification, classification, tracking, and kill determination. The 3D imaging techniques also have enormous commercial market, ranging from 3D TV, virtual reality, 3D modeling and simulation, Internet, industrial inspection, vehicle navigation, robotics and teleoperation, to medical imaging, dental measurement, appeal and footwear industries.  Although many 3D imaging techniques have been developed in the past, most of them can only provide 3D measurement of single point or single line on objects, in one measurement. None of 3D imaging systems currently available on the market can provide                                       al-time at a video rate. These systems therefore can not be used in high-speed 3D imaging applications.  This proposed SBIR effort-seeks to provide a leapfrog advance for scanning laser based 3D imaging technology. The approach we proposed, dubbed as the Double Flash 3D (DF3D) Imager, is able to acquire full-frame 3D images of objects in a scene at CCD camera's frame rate (30 fps or faster), a capability that no other 3D imaging sensor can provide presently.",

        "abstract": "Flight trajectories of airplanes are three dimensional in nature.  Conventional displays used in pilot training facilities can only show two-dimensional sections of the trajectory.  This makes the learning of spatial awareness a very difficult problem in pilot training because the operator must mentally visualize a 3D environment by reading and interpreting 2D displays.  Furthermore, when the display does not show the third spatial dimension as readily apparent as the other two, pilots tend to solve conflict avoidance problems in the displayed two directions more often than in the three dimensions.  For conflict resolution, this implies that a 2D display based training may bias pilots' solution to planar maneuvers.  A high resolution true volumetric 3D display device would literally (and figuratively) add a new dimension to the pilot training, advanced human/computer interface, flight trajectory visualization and many other applications in the AF.  The volumetric 3D display capability reduces the workload on both pilots and air traffic controllers, resulting in faster recognition and improved situational awareness.  This can improve safety and efficiency.  The 3D spatial relationship is natural and intuitive, more easily seen and more quickly identified, allowing pilots to make more efficient decisions, to be able to identify conflicts more quickly.  The primary objective of this Phase I SBIR program is to investigate the feasibility of a novel volumetric  3D display concept that can provide true 3D, full-color, authosterographic and high spatial resolution 3D images that can be viewed by multiple viewers without using any eyeweat.  The second objective of this effort is to develop strategies of synergistically integrating the volumetric 3D display in AF pilot training systems and other 3D visualization systems.",

        "abstract": "Development of a low-cost high-exclusion proton-exchange membrane (PEN) for use as an electrolyte in a liquid feed direct methanol fuel cell (LFDMFC) is proposed.  The LFDMFC, because of its simplicity (no reformer, simple heat management) and inherent reliability (cell membrane flooded with water), is a potentially attractive power source for low- to medium-power applications, such as a battery replacement for mobile electric power applications.  One drawback to LFDMFCs is that methanol permeates across currently available PEMs from the anode to the cathode where it reacts with air (02), resulting in parasitic methanol loss and reduced fuel cell voltage.  To overcome this problem, Giner, Inc. proposes to develop a composite membrane which is expected to minimize methanol permeability while maintaining high proton transport, leading to increased LFDMFC power output and improved system efficiency.  The research objectives are to incorporate a methanol exclusion layer within a membrane, evaluate physical/chemical properties of the composite membrane, identify conditions to bond electrodes to the membrane, evaluate the membranes in a LFDMFC, and conduct a cost analysis.  We expect to develop an advanced PEM for use in a LFDMFC which results in a significant decrease in methanol crossover, compared to Nafion 117, while providing high LFDMFC performance.  BENEFITS: LFDMFC-powered vehicles have a very large market potential in states mandating use of zero-emission vehicles by early in the next decade.  Additional opportunities include airport and mail vehicles, golf carts, lawn mowers, power tools and dispersed power generators.  Military applications include standard vehicles, unmanned underwater and air vehicles, and person portable backpack power supplies.",

Constant Natural Frequency (CNF) mounts are currently used in millions of commercial and foreign applications, and improvements are offered in published and on-going research. The CNF concept will be adapted to Navy needs and the commercial market, which will help insure a Navy vendor base.  Empirically- and analytically-derived elastomer shaped mounts yielding a stiffness proportional to the load and a constant natural frequency over a weight ratio of 1 to 9 have been demonstrated.  An additional benefit of the new mounts is, because they are relatively insensitive to load, the mount installation is greatly simplified.  Globe Rubber Works (GRW), an innovative mount manufacturer, experienced in challenging applications of special elastomers for Navy and commercial customers, heads the team of the CNF mount designer; ETC, a company with a long record of performing Navy shock and vibration engineering; and a commercial mount user, to insure that the mount research will be focused on commercial as well as Navy needs.  A prototype mount will be prepared and tested to demonstrate how the concept can be used to greatly reduce the number of mounts required by the Navy.",

We deem this approach to be more effective in the large-scale testing of electronic equpment than adhering to original test requirements based upon design criteria that may or may not reflect actual system performance.The approach cited in this proposal promotes the design of an integrated system for the detection of trends in equipment performance based upon test parameter data.

        "abstract": "Traffic on today's communications networks of interconnected Local and Wide Area Networks is limited mainly by the bandwidth of the communication channel.  Increasing bandwidth to accommodate the high data rate of multi-tactic transmissions is necessary.  One way to balance the situation is to harness available local processing power to compress data before it is transmitted.  We propose an alternative system in which the compression process is offloaded to a dedicated processor to allow real time compression while minimizing the impact on local system performance.  Digital signal processing techniques are used to implement real time adaptive compression algorithms to reduce the volume of data to be transmitted.  Multiple algorithms for entropy encoding are run in parallel to produce results from which the best compression of a stream of data may be selected.  The networking of computers via satellite systems introduces a particular subset of problems that must be considered for real time compression of transmitted data.  To produce a robust lossless compression system, the interaction of various elements of the communication system such that transmission protocols, protocol headers, data encryption, and timing delays, are investigated.",

        "abstract": "An innovative data-derived motion compensation technique is proposed to provide the accurate positional information needed for high quality near-field UWB SAR image formation. The low-latency, computationally efficient technique does not require any special targets or a prior knowledge of the scene developing. Assuming nominal values for aircraft velocity and altitude, the algorithm derives accurate estimates of the deviations from the nominal trajectory in three dimensions based on processing received radar data from a general scene. Therefore, the algorithm estimates the (x, y, z) position of the radar antenna on each pulse and hence enables high-resolution image formation. Position estimates in the horizontal cross-track and vertical directions are derived based on the spatial correlation existing across the synthetic aperture measured over a number of disjoint range subintervals. Velocity estimates are also obtained from the data.  Phase I will consist of algorithm development and performance assessment as a function of latency, swath length of data, antenna beamwidth, average aircraft velocity, dynamics of the aircraft and signal-to-clutter/noise ratio. Phase II will consist of coding and demonstrating an optimized version of the algorithm on a real-time image formation processor assuming 1.5 Khz PRF, 50-200m/s aircraft velocities, and 256K point records.  BENEFITS:  The proposed data-derived measurement technique will provide accurate positional information to enable high quality foliage/ground penetration radar image formation. In addition to concealed target detection, commercial applications include such services as bald earth mapping for road construction planning, forest characterization, finding near-surface mineral deposits, locating downed aircraft, and humanitarian unexploded ordnance cleanup.",

Dissemination technologies developed for the agriculture industry and by the U.S. Army for the formation of battlefield smokes/obscurants will be evaluated.  These technologies will be assessed for their viability in the dissemination of cyanobacteria as an arid land inoculant, which share size, shape, and density characteristics with existing powder dispersions used in battlefield smoke dissemination and agricultural fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides. The effort will investigate the physiology of the various bacteria of interest (microcoleus vaginatus, and others) and their ability to withstand the mechanical, chemical and storage environments adopted for the successful dissemination of centimeter or smaller sized materials.  Techniques to be examined for particle formation and dissemination include spray drying agglomeration, mechanical chopping/pelletizing equipment, flash atomization dissemination, and large scale smoke generator technology.  Approaches will focus strictly upon methods that involve no water for the dissemination process.  In addition, based upon current limitations in the rapid growth of cyanobacteria, the effort will examine non-traditional methods for large scale, economical growth of the bacteria directly onto suitable substrates that permit their ready drying and packaging for storage, dissemination, and rapid adherence to the soil upon contact with the arid land environment.  BENEFITS:  This technology represents the only reasonable approach to cost-effective, large-scale reclamation of arid areas.  As such, there should be a significant market among Federal and State agencies involved  in reclamation of disturbed lands in arid regions of the country, e.g., the DoD, Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Forest Service.",

High power testing of linear collider systems are presently being performed at 11.4 gigahertz in the USA and Japan, with typical accelerating gradients in the range of 30-60 MV/m.  This application describes a novel 17.136 gigahertz linear accelerator system designed to achieve an accelerating gradient of 100 MV/m.  The objective of Phase I is to investigate the feasibility of integrating a high gradient 17 gigahertz accelerator waveguide into the recirculating loop of a phase-locked traveling wave resonant ring.  This would allow the peak power available from the klystron RF source to be multiplied four-fold, providing an accelerating gradient of 100 to 110 MV/m.   During Phase II, this compact accelerator system will be fabricated and interfaced with an existing klystron and electron beam injector to evaluate the high power performance.  A detailed beam optics analysis will be performed in Phase I to ensure the design parameters of the new accelerator waveguide are consistent with correct capture, compression, asymptotic location, and subsequent acceleration of injected electron bunches, for the proposed unique gradient conditions of 100 MV/m at an operating wavelength of 1.75 cm.  Based on this analysis, the microwave parameters of the resonant ring and accelerator will be matched to achieve desired power buildup characteristics, design specifications of the high power ring components will be established, and a layout drawing of the system configuration will be prepared.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  It is anticipated that the Phase I and Phase II efforts will result in a compact accelerator system suitable for high gradient research and advanced accelerator applications and for evaluating 17 gigahertz linear collider technology._",

This cost, plus attendant costs associated with equipment downtime and lost production to replace failed die components, is excessive and can be reduced significantly by pretreatment of the components with physical vapor desposition (PVD) coatings.  Thin film coatings have been used in single layers to improve the durability of tool steel used in die-castings dies.  Multi-layer coatings are expected to be a major improvement and coatings applied with a nano-layered approach should improve life significantly.  Phase I will be the first step to attempt to optimize an nano-layered film system and then obtain preliminary data for comparison with conventionally coated physical/chemical vapor deposition (PCVD) single layer coated dies.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: If successful, this project will lead to the development of a coating system or technique that would extend the lifetime of these die casting components and improve the competitive position of USA castings in the global marketplace._",

Phase I research demonstrated ability to upgrade 18% protein midds to 47% protein concentrate, in part, by hydrolyzing hemicellulose to pentose for high protein yeast propagation, instead of leaving it as an inexpensive source of fiber. In the U.S. 224 flour mills produce 5.13 million tons of midds annually, which, if processed, represent $1.1 billion in sales and $190 million net income potential. The price of midds would rise. A $20/ton increase translates to $.10/bushel, or nearly $235 million more value for American wheat. Equally important are prospects that such processing could be a pretreatment ?bridge' to more economical cellulosic biomass-to-ethanol processing. Recovering a significant co-product feed credit greatly improves biomass potential. Wheat screenings could also be processed, helping improve wheat quality and value. Research in Phase II focuses on a prototype plant large enough to provide product samples for feed trials necessary to support commercial expansion of the bioprocess. The prototype plant will also establish operational costs for determining profit potential in commercial plants.",

No longer are sugar and pineapple plantation farming the mainstays of Hawai'i's agricultural economy. The focus now is on diversified and sustainable agriculture, taking place on small to medium size family- farms. These entrepreneurial farmers are providing new opportunities toward increasing theirs, their community's, the state's and the country's economic livelihood.\n\nTaro farming offers these small family-farms competitive advantages and opportunities to exploit the growing domestic taro market, without placing undue marketing pressure upon existing taro farming operations in the state and country. In 1997, the United States taro import market was estimated at $22,896,000 with over 60 million pounds being imported. The domestic demand for taro has increased by over 30 percent since 1993, with the import custom's value more than doubling from its 1993 value of $10.2 million. This proposal is directed at determining the feasibility of various marketing strategies for taro and taro-based value-added products, including import substitution strategies. Thereupon, a strategy of penetrating and gaining market share, in this predominantly foreign supplied domestic market, would be effectively researched and developed for Hawai'i's agricultural industry and its many small family-farms.",

The Phase I effort focuses on the analysis, design, fabrication, and benchtop testing of prototype systems.  The actuators will generate disturbances that are large enough to significantly influence the performance of a high-lift system but will be energy efficient and small enough so that multiple actuators can be imbedded in an airfoil.  A follow-on Phase II study will incorporat the best actuators into a high-lift airfoil system for detailed wind tunnel tests.  The significance of this modular actuator subsystem is that it has the potential to be incorporated into the design of high-lift systems, ultimately leading to real-time separation control.  Recent research has shown that various actuator types are capable of successfully achieving boundary-layer control, yet such actuators are currently impractical for larger-scale implementation.  The approach here is innovative in the application of advanced piezoelectric technology.  The proposed system may be applied to the design of virtually any fluid system that endeavors to either prevent separation or promote mixing, such as airfoils, nozzles, and diffusers.",

        "abstract": "Laminar to turbulent transition phenomenon in hypersonic flows remains poorly understood although it has a profound impact on the thermal protection system weight, vehicle drag and air-breathing engine performance.  Transition location uncertainty forces designers to be conservative by adding weight and reducing thrust.  Accurate prediction techniques are needed since existing applicable transition databases are insufficient and validated arbitrary configuration prediction codes are non-existent.  It is proposed to develop a novel computational tool for hypersonic transition prediction which can account for environmental effects.  The computational tool can not only capture the complex physical phenomenon, but also is computationally efficient and, therefore, has the potential of becoming a design tool for aerospace vehicles of the 21st century.",

Recent programs have involved application of products such as Malathion to effectively lower insect populations in the infected areas. Concerns about adverse health effects from exposure to Malathion and other toxic bait products have been raised by government agencies. USDA and APHIS are currently seeking alternatives that produce less risk to public health and the environment. RIFA control studies were conducted at Clemson University and Texas A&M using formulations that contained Phloxine B and Uranine as the active ingredients. The formulations were shown to be comparable in efficacy to the leading consumer brand (AMDRO\u00bf, manufactured by American Cyanamid). The proposed program is directed at developing a fire ant product using photo-active dyes as the insecticide and to conduct safety and clinical studies, perform efficacy studies, and registration with the EPA for commercial distribution.",

To support the requirements presented by rapidly changing weapons acquisition environments, WS_ICM's methodology is based on cost as an independent variable through the total life cycle.  The model comprises three modules:  the cost Estimating Model (CEM): the production cost Model (PCM); and the Operational and Support Model (OSM).  The implementation of the WS-ICM will provide a reliable data base for program management decision-making consistent with Acquisition Reform.This SBIR Phase I results in a conceptual, computer-based OSM module design that integrates with the CEM and PCM modules forming a conceptual WS-ICM.  The OCM can be used throughout the weapon's life-cycle to support both the Aeronautical System Center's program offices and Air Logistics Centers.The potential benefits include: 1)an integrated tool that enables complex logistics trade-off decisions-where none exists today; 2)linkage of existing analytical operational and support (O&S) tools with an O&S database to redefine this parametric data with actual O&S cost data as the system is fielded; and 3) accommodation of O&S programmatic decisions.",

There is a need for a spectrally flexible system that can significantly reduce the number of bands used for each specific application.  Such a system should have the capability either to individually adjust the band center wavelength and the bandwidth of each band or have the capability to switch easily between pre-designed spectral sets, optimized for each specific application.  Novel solutions are offered in this proposal for producing low cost, custom designed spectral   dispersive elements with flexible band centers and bandwidths.  During the proposed Phase I effort, two parallel approaches will be considered, each having advantages for specific applications.  If the application requires a set of narrow bands in a spectral region, but in another region can suffice with a single extra-broad band, the best approach will be to implement two pre-designed sets of dispersive elements.  On the other hand, there are applications which need fine tuning of the narrow bands with moderate requirements for the bandwidth tunability.  In this case, an array of individually tunalbe dispersive elements would be the best solution.",

The basic technology is a capacitive blade detection system which, couples to a very accurate timer, and post-processing, figures out the dither in the time-of-passage due to a blade resonance and infers synchronous vibration that way.  The sensor is small, non-intrusive and one sensor measures all blades in one disk, hence has great operational potential.  The early version of this system was demonstrated in Poland, where it was originally developed and did detect blade damage in actual operational jet engines.",

As these interconnects become large so does the total interconnect cross-sectional area. This leads to the formation of information bottlenecks. The future of computer systems will depend on the elimination of these bottlenecks and without question these systems will rely upon the use of photonics-based components. Fiber optic technology has the intrinsically high bandwidth needed to meet the future demands for high performance information processing. However, practical use of high-bandwidth photonics-based computers, and signal processors, will depend on the availability and acceptance of low-cost, high performance optoelectronics-based components. These components are necessary to fully develop the following key technology areas that are needed to make the transition from electronics to optoelectronics.

Current methods for microwave shielding and absorption have several drawbacks. HVS proposes multifunctional composite sandwiches with novel chiral materials, nonlinear metal oxides, ferroelectric tunable materials, voltage controllable dielectrics and conducting polymers (to control the surface wave in the case of absorption). Drs. Varadan, owners of HVS Technologies and professors at CEEAM, Penn State are co-inventors of three US patents on Chiral Electromagnetic Shielding and Absorptive Materials, Electromagnetic Shielding Materials, and Voltage Tunable Dielectric Ceramics. These patents are assigned to Penn State. Applications are envisaged for Army Mobile Shelters and vehicle surfaces for reduced RCS, canopy and windshield with required level of shielding, etc. The Phase I work proposed is optimization and numerical design of sandwich materials incorporating chiral materials, nonlinear metal oxides, ferroelectric tunable materials, voltage controllable dielectrics and conducting polymers to result in broadband performance and at the same time meet the stringent needs of specific Army applications. Samples will be prepared and the performance assessed using unique characterization facilities at HVS and CEEAM demonstrating the viability of our approach. A subcontract to Penn State is planned.  BENEFITS:  The Phase II effort will address broader issue related to multifunctional material manufacture and commercialization. All needed capital equipment can be financed with state programs for small businesses. We have contacts with several private investors and interested industrial partners for joint ventures. The US military and commercial sectors who have need for high performance microwave absorbers and shielding materials will have easy access to a US supplier. We are confident that this Phase I project will result in a technical approach that can be commercialized for US Army needs.",

While the current trend is to employ high frequency techniques for ATR studies, various aspects of electromagnetic physics, such as traveling waves, dispersive and other material characterization, interaction between electrically small and large components of an LO target (small fins on a long missile body), and low frequency (50 MHz to 2 GHz) modeling, require more exact solutions based on time-domain Maxwell's equations.  The parallel, unstructured grid-based, time-domain CEM code, UPRCS, developed under the PACESETTER contract, will complement ongoing high frequency ATR applications.The key attributes of the time-domain UPRCS code are (1) pulse mode for broad band response, (2) complex geometry modeling using unstructured surface and volume gridding including material treatment, (3) highly scalable parallel code architecture, and (4) GUI for user friendly enviornment.  While advances in the time-domain are being made in all fronts, the primary focus of this SBIR Phase I proposal is to develop the necessary procedures and validate the time-domain technology for ATR applications and extend the technology to X-band frequency range.",

Research on scale reliability and new alloy development requires real time temperature monitoring of the scale growth and associated stresses.  An instrument for monitoring the oxide growth rate and stresses at high temperatures during mechanical loading will be developed and built.

        "abstract": "In this project, we will develop and demonstrate new feature-based algorithms for target modeling and tracing across hyperspectral imagery acquired at different times under unknown condition.  The problems addressed by this project are more general than traditional ATR problems in the sense that target properties are initially assumed to be unknown.  The algorithms are derived from recently developed physics-based invariants of hyperspectral data that do not depend on the illumination environment or atmospheric conditions.  These invariants reduce the high dimensionality associated with a hyperspectral data that do not depend on the illumination environment or atmospheric conditions.  These invariants reduce the high dimensionality associated with a hyperspectral target signature to a low dimensionality intrinsic representation.  The information contained in hyperspectral data enables the algorithms to discriminate similar materials as well as camouflaged objects from background.  Hyperspectral data also enables local apporaches to be used for ATR making the algorithms relatively insensitive to partial obscuration.  Since hyperspectral data is complementary to several other sensing modalities, we will investigate the fusion of information obtained from the hyperspectral algorithms with information obtained from other sensors.  The performance of the new algorithms will be quantified relative to traditional approaches using imagery containing military vehicles and other objects under different illumination and atmospheric conditions with varying degrees of bacdground clutter and object obscuration.",

The objective of this Phase I program is to demonstrate the feasibility of producing miniature, axisymmetric liquid bi-propellant rocket thrusters from nanolayered ceramic composites in an effort to overcome the limitations of existing designs, materials and fabrication techniques. CVD-based SiC is selected as the primary material constituent because of its low thermal expansivity, high thermal conductivity, and outstanding high-temperature mechanical properties and oxidation resistance. Minor nanolayering constituents will be selected for empirical evaluation based on their: (1) known ability to effectively interrupt the SiC deposition epitaxy, thereby increasing strength and thermal shock resistance by controlling grain refinement; and (2) propensity to provide beneficial elastic modulus mismatch, thereby further increasing strength and fracture toughness by limiting dislocation motion. Following the development of a viable composite system, miniature thrusters with integral impinging-stream injectors will be fabricated and delivered to BMDO for further evaluation.",

Time-to-Digital Converters (TDCs) are used to measure time intervals, where the most critical parameter is the time resolution.  The best commercially-available multi-hit TDCs have a 25 picosecond (ps) time resolution, which is not sufficient for a number of nuclear physics experiments.  Since particle detectors work in liquid helium environments, room temperature interfaces to custom TDCs introduce uncertainties to the experimental data.  This project will design and fabricate a TDC with a 2 ps time resolution and a 32-bit dynamic range.  The TDC will consist of a digital counter for counting high-speed (up to 30 GHz) clock pulses as well as an analog prescaler capable of measuring the time interval within a clock period with up to a 1 ps resolution.  The TDC integrated circuit will be produced with a VME bus interface.  Phase I will design and carry out high-speed testing on an analog prescaler.  The anticipated time resolution of this prescaler is 1 ps.  The prescaler will be integrated, on a chip, with an existing all-digital multi-hit TDC.  Thus, this project will demonstrate a single-channel ultra-high time resolution multi-hit TDC.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The proposed TDC will provide unprecedented resolution and dynamic range, along with multi-hit capability while accommodating multiple channels for the efficient implementation of large nuclear physics systems.  This TDC will also improve the performance of military emitter direction finding and commercial modulation domain instrumentation._",

Making full use of the information contained in such signals requires digitizing them with as much resolution and speed as possible.  Amplifiers which boost the signal level prior to analog-to-digital conversion introduce distortion which reduces the useful information contained in those low-level detector signals.  A high sensitivity analog-to-digital converter requiring no preamplifier is needed.  This project will develop an ultrasensitive superconducting analog-to-digital converter requiring no preamplifier.  This device will be capable of digitizing signals of order ~1 microamp with 8 bits of resolution at 100 MHz sample rate, using a novel high-sensitivity, high linearity front end.  A multichannel system will be developed integrating many digitizers on a single chip ultimately.

        "abstract": "Today's network technologies easily reach 1 Gbit/sec bandwidths, but current IO board products based on these Gbit network technologies cannot harness that bandwidth. We have already developed an Intelligent IO-to-N (IION) interface. The IION interface allows any modern high-speed IO bus (e.g., PCI) to be interconnected to any modern Network protocol (e.g., SCI, Fibre Channel, ATM). The interface's onboard Intelligent hardware enables the IION board to deliver high delivered throughput, low latency, and flexible programming interfaces. Our IION board's architecture is unique because of the onboard intelligence that not only allows the board's configuration to be modified for specific IO buses, Network protocols, and new applications, but which incorporates new algorithms (which we have already invented) to increase its performance. For this effort, we propose to further the development of the IION architecture. First, we will build a complexity/cost/performance model of the IION architecture - this allows quick trade-off studies and rapid prototyping of new boards. Second, we will define a General-purpose Application Programming Interface - this enables general-purpose parallel programming in enterprise clustered workstation configurations. Third, we will demonstrate our existing IION board - this will show how the IION concept performs in the real world. Fourth, we will design an avionics-specific version of the IION board - this will demonstrate how the prior three results can be used to produce new variations of the IION board. At the end of Phase 1, we will be ready to begin the Phase 2 work of implementing the avionics-specific IION board.",

        "abstract": "As computer architectures evolve away from monolithic applications towards distributed, cooperating sets of objects of higher and higher granularity it becomes increasingly vital to have sophisticated distributed monitoring and management services.  Systems containing tens of thousands of objects deployed over thousands of nodes will be deployed.  The monitoring and management requirements for different groups of objects will vary widely.  Traditional approaches to monitoring and management are inadequate to address these widely varying needs as they typically operate at the level of a platform node or a system rather than the object process.  Ongoing work in the CORBA community and OMG CORBA Facilites Task Force will provide a basis for system-level management service for this proposed work.  The innovation of the Phase I approach is that individual objects are responsible for certain aspects of their own monitoring and management.  These objects possess behaviors which can be invoked from well-defined interfaces.  The objects will be able to delegate certain functions to system-level management services, which would possess the breadth of information necessary to make appropriate decisions and take action.  This is a multi-level management model where the granularity of the architecture matches exactly the requisite granularity for large-scale object systems.",

        "abstract": "The key barrier to realizing new capabilities in real-time data fusion and display systems is integrating current research & development software assets from academia, commercial and military.  In practice, almost 100% of real-time data fusion and display systems are custom software driven by domain and often task-specific requirements.  In the domain of military data fusion and display systems, mission changes result in requirements change and thus integration of new capabilities is the most significant problem.  The innovation leverages distributed object-based technology for advancing Data Fusion and Display software components.  The promise of component-based applications is to enable developers and end-users to                                             nd matching prefabricated software components.  With Air Force guidance, a selected set of Data Fusion and Display software, libraries and data will be transformed into components.  Users will be able to assemble custom applications from components located anywhere on the network while developers continue to add new components.  Reusable components will result in significant reductions in the cost of Data Fusion and Display application system development, test, and upgrade.  The result is the ability to adapt quickly to different user and mission demands, while achieving reliability through the reuse of verified components.",

Trained by exposure to cumulative experimental data, this paradigm may autonomously compute processing routes toward specifically targeted end goals.  In the case of thin film growth and removal, the Creativity Machine may readily experiment with alternative processing routes, finally recommending all growth and/or etching paths that lead to desired stoichiometric and crystallographic film properties.  Furthermore, it may design any thin film process within the constraints imposed by environmental compliance regulations.Until now, a significant difficulty in applying this technique to `real world' thin film growth/removal problems has been the sheer size of the data files normally encountered.    Typically, thousands of data points, taken across multiple process parameters, must be converted to `neural newtwork digestible' form before the paradigm may be applied.  Herein, we propose the development of a novel signal compression technique that will enable the Creativity Machine paradigm to solve difficult and complex materials processing problems.  We then propose how this combined process compression and discovery technique may be appled to varied problems in thin film growth and removal.",

This proposal will demonstrate the feasibility of using a novel self contained isothermal particle (SCIP) assay to detect Yersinia pestis. SCIP integrates extraction, purification, amplification and detection into a single testing device. The assay is expected to take less than an hour, yet provide the sensitivity and specificity afforded by nucleic acid based assays. The self contained nature of the device elminates possibility of contamination from previously ran samples.  The extraction method is extremely efficient, with expected recoveries greater than 65%, and does not require the use of centrifugation or vacuum source. The nucleic acid is purified and free from inhibitors of amplification enzymes. The amplification strategy proposed is isothermal, eliminating the use of thermocycling equipment and produces high copy in less than 30 minutes. The amplified product is labeled for detection during the amplification reaction. The detection mechanism is based on microparticle and lateral flow chromatography technology. The assay will be easy to perform and can be completed in the field or at the first level of medical care.  BENEFITS:  The successful development of a SCIP assay for Y. pestis detection will make testing for plague in biological or environmental samples easy and rapid. Early detection will provide an opportunity for treatment before the disease progresses to fatality. SCIP testing increases the sensitivity, specificity and precision for detection of Y pestis.  SCIP can be used in the field, eliminating the use of skilled laboratory personnel and sophisticated equipment. Based on preliminary cost analysis, SCIP, will provide substantial cost savings in terms of medical care. The SCIP concept is adaptable for detection of almost any organism with unique and determined genetic sequences.",

        "abstract": "Implant Sciences Corporation proposes to develop a novel high gain, high temperature solar blind phototransistor design based on ion implanted Gallium Nitride semiconductor material which will meet the demanding performance specifications required for advanced aircraft and space borne applications. The advantages of GaN in these applications are threefold: first, since the atomic bond in GaN is very strong, applications in radiation intensive environments allows for device survivability; second, GaN is a wide band gap material which allows devices to operate in high temperature environments; third/ it is highly sensitive to the W signature of missile propulsion emissions. Our lateral device design features a homoepitaxial GaN bipolar phototransistor with the base, emitter, and collector doped by ion implantation. Key to producing these devices is the p-doping of the base which Implant Sciences has just recently achieved with a proprietary implantation process. Ion implantation allows selective area doping which allows for cost reductions associated with device fabrication. Implanting donor ions in the emitter and collector will also the reduce series resistance associated with this device. Devices will be fabricated, tested, and compared with device results in the literature based on other semiconductor materials. In Phase II we shall optimize the device design and the implantation conditions to produce a device which can deliver highly sensitive solar-blind phototransistors.",

In contrast to the existing 3-D imaging methods, the proposed technique is capable of acquiring a depth-section image in a single shot, and then scanning through the remaining lateral direction for complete 3-D object information. The advantages of the proposed system over conventional techniques include the ability of the novel method to perform a single-shot measurement of a surface cross-section, a simpler and therefore less expensive optical system design, and simplified signal and image processing that can be realized with an inexpensive computing system. These advantages make our novel technique suitable for performing on-line 3-D imaging/measurement in a realistic manufacturing system and even possibly in a severe manufacturing environment. The main goal of phase I of this project will be to perform a detailed design of the proposed 3-D quantitative imaging system, construction and testing of the initial system prototype, characterization of system functionality and performance, and development of computer software for data acquisition, signal and image processing. The work will set stage for phase II, of which the objective is to build a commercial viable prototype in coordination with industry standards.",

Separation can be achieved by incorporating polymer into the space between silicate layers in the clay.  Gas embryos will be generated within this space to initiate foaming.  This foaming would detach the plates further and lead to foam with superior properties.  Plate molecules of clay will be delaminated by urethane to form a Polyurethane-Clay nanocomposite.  The objective is to make a new generation of microcellular foams from the polymer-clay nanocomposite.  In Phase I, urethane or urea is proposed to modify the surface of the clay molecules.

        "abstract": "An advanced ultrasonic inspection system is proposed to locate and characterize defects in thick composite armor.  The technique will detect characteristic signals to identify and evaluate defects in the material.  The methodology has also an inherent large signal-to-noise ratio enhancement that allows it to be used to inspect highly attenuating materials.  If defects are present, the changes in the characteristic signal will help identify the type of defect.  The defect could be classified whether it is due to delaminations or impact damage.  Phase I will concentrate on implementing the ultrasonic technique on various composite armor specimens to determine the optimal inspection parameters.  The methodology will be used to test composite armor specimens with simulated defects to determine the characteristic response from each defect type and to catalog the information for additional processing and classification.  This will demonstrate the ability of this ultrasonic method to inspect thick composite armor samples and identify the type of defect.  Using the information collected from these tests, an initial design of the inspection system will be completed for the examination of actual parts.  Preliminary contacts with commercial users have demonstrated a significant interest in the proposed system, simplifying the commercialization process.  BENEFITS:  This project will result in a state-of-the-art portable ultrasonic system that can perform inspection and characterization of composite armor in advanced military vehicles.  There is a market for an improved ultrasonic instrument capable of inspecting thick, attenuating composites for a wide variety of a applications, including submersible vessels, boats, trucks, automobiles, trains, bridges and military vehicles.  This continued increase in the use of composite materials requires a system capable of rapid, nondestructive inspection to insure the quality of composite structures.",

In many cases, indigenous biomass power sources such as agricultural residues, wood, or wood by-products are readily available.  These offer major advantages in terms of environmental impact, fuel costs, fuel transportation, and sustainable fuel resources.  This project will integrate a low emissions gasifier with a long-life, maintenance-free Stirling engine, an approach that solves many earlier problems encountered when biogas is used with Stirling engines. This engine design concept should provide 40,000 hours of maintenance-free, degradation-free operation.  The gasifier will be designed, fabricated, tested and integrated with an existing Stirling engine in Phase I.  This will enable an early demonstration of the integrated system using wood pellets as a fuel.  Phase II will demonstrate the use of a wide range of biomass feedstocks and conduct field testing of two market applications.\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Identified markets include off-grid applications reuinte in remote locations such as Alaska and rural electrification for emerging nations.

Infograte, Incorporated has developed a robust software solution that  allows users to transparently extract data stored across disparate and geographically  dispersed heterogeneous databases from a single user-friendly interface.  The software solution consists of a proprietary knowledge representation, development  technique, and query processor.  Infograte's representation employs a three-tiered  extension of entity-category-relationship theory as the foundation for a global schema  that models the logic of a virtual database federation.  The development technique is  an iterative methodology that is used to build the required global schema.  The query  processing algorithm follows a mediation approach to interpret the global schema and  semantically translate queries across the distributed database federation.  InfoGrate will apply its knowledge representation and development technique to the  Navy's ship engineering data environment.  The result will be a global schema that  can be used with InfoGrate's query processor to virtually integrate the data.  The  technique will be applied by the Infograte research team, which has a successful  track record of developing and commercializing database technologies.",

Different SOF missions will be reviewed and different sensor requirements will be defined.  Commercial applications will be similarly processed.  A search will be made for the most promising candidates.  Cost, and user timelines will be used to rank the technology candidates for maturity and manufacturability.

InSb and the newer uncooled microbolometer detectors will be compared taking into account system performance (driven primarily by the detector and optics selection) and costs involved.  Platform stabilization addressing gyro stabilized gimbals and lower cost pan and tilts will be examined and compared for an aerostat platform with a goal of deriving a lower cost pan and tilt with adequate performance.  Findings will be reviewed with the customer to determine the optimal low cost airborne surveillance system.  Preliminary costing estimates indicate system cost could be substantially reduced.  After the sensor selection is made, a system prototype design will determine the instrumentation suite, which includes the sensors, position control, platform stabilization, communication, receiving console, monitors and control for a stationary aerostat platform.

Austen, Principal Investigator\nDr. Alfred R. Austen, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG02-98ER82598\nAmount:  $75,000\n\nNiobium aluminide superconductor wires are used in magnets for high energy physics and fusion research.  The barrier to making the required long lengths of this wire is breakage during the final wire drawing reduction of the niobium-aluminum composite precursor wire.   In this project, new hydrostatic extrusion technology will be developed to replace the wire drawing technology for the final 5 to 1 diameter reduction process for the composite wire.  Hydrostatic extrusion requires that the long lengths of wire be coiled to fit into the relatively short, high pressure hydrostatic extrusion chamber.  In Phase I, the feasibility of the new hydrostatic extrusion technology will be investigated to demonstrate that:  (1) the composite wire can be coiled and straightened without damage, (2) the extrusion pressure can be reduced by a factor of two or more by elevating the temperature of the process to as high as 350\u00bfC, and (3) hot hydrostatic extrusion will not cause defect formation be adversely changing the relative strengths of the composite components.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Long lengths of niobiom-aluminum wire would be ideal for making the next generation of more reliable high field dipole magnets in the 15-20 Tesla magnetic field range.  Also, for high energy physics and fusion research, Nb3Al superconductor would be very desirable as an insert coil material for a small Nb3Sn magnet to raise the overall magnetic field._",

However, successful use of composite materials in these applications depends upon customer's ability to determine their properties and detecting volumetric or surface defects, if present. Most promising way of estimating properties and detecting defects in these materials is through the non-destructive evaluation (NDE) of the materials using Electomagnetics (EM) diagnostic tools.  In this proposed innovation, Innovative Aerodynamic Technologies (IAT) will develop (Phase I), a microwave system for detecting faults and cracks in a composite material and support the experimental results through numerical simulation. The successful demonstration of concept to detect faults in a composite material through experimental procedure may lead to the development of dedicated microwave system for fault detection.  By the end of this innovation, IAT proposes to deliver the experimental setup for fault detection and also numerical simulation program for non-destructive evaluation of composite material slab. It will evaluate the resolution of NDE system in terms of size of fault/crack, spacing between two faults for given frequency range and angular range of scanning system. It will also deliver preliminary experimental results on some simple faults in multilayer slabs using hp 8510 Network Analyzer.  BENEFITS:  The proposed portable electromagnetic diagnostic toll will improve the quality checking prccedure for industries manufacturing composite materials.

        "abstract": "The overall objectives of the proposed program are to develop non-invasive, wear resistant, light weight sensors and instrumentation for in-situ monitoring of temperature and vapor pressure for space and land based anti-friction rolling element bearings.  This will be achieved by depositing thin films of appropriate materials on the raceways of rolling element bearings using RF-sputter coating and patterning the coatings into micro-sensors using photolithography.  RF-sputter coating allows deposition of coatings at temperatures less than 180 degrees C.  Maintaining low temperatures is essential in assuring that the hardened bearing steel is not tempered.  Zirconium and nichrome will be used for development of micro-temperature and pressure sensors respectively.  In Phase I micro-temperature and pressure sensors will be fabricated and evaluated in a bearing simulator rig allowing rolling and sliding conditions.  Sliding increases surface heating and shear stress and tests the durability of micro-sensors.  These micro-sensors can be used with minor modifications to monitor lubricated contacts in aerospace and automotive applications (e.g. gears, journal bearings, seals, etc.).  A thermal balance formed using a thermocouple junction both as a sensor and heating block will be used to measure vapor pressure.

        "abstract": "Traditionally, engineered artifacts are designed to be strong and stiff.  Designs in nature are strong but not stiff - they are compliant.  Although nature thrives on use of compliance, the engineering world has traditionally limited itself to rigid structures and mechanisms.  Practical solutions can be developed by exploiting preferred effects of compliance.  Majority of current research in adaptive structures embraces the traditional notion of deploying a plethora of actuators (distributed actuation) within a stiff structure to simulate compliant behavior in an adaptive airfoil.  Scalability and reliability of such distributed actuation methods is questionable.  If the underlying structure is designed to be inherently compliant, then the resulting design will require fewer actuators and simpler controls.The proposed Adaptive Compliant Wind (ACW) concept relies on distributed compliance rather than distributed actuation.  The ACW potentially offers significant advantages in terms of unitized light-weight construction actuated by a single conventional electric motor, high strain and force capabilities, low power requirements, excellent packaging efficiency, no heat generation, excellent dynamic response, low hysteresis and can be tailored for force or displacement amplification.  The ACW concept is a new approach and a scaleable solution to the problem of achieving desired shape changes in airfoils.  The ACW eliminates discrete control surfaces since the mechanism is contained within the airfoil.",

        "abstract": "A high resolution, millimeter-wave radiometric imaging system with the ability to penetrate obscurants (rain, clouds, dust, sand and smoke) is a highly attractive surveillance tool with broad application to satellite, uninhabited aerial vehicle (UAV) and other military and commercial platforms. Achievement of such a system through application of conventional interferometric or sparse aperture techniques has been shown impractical for many potential applications. This is due to the inherent difficulty of simultaneously satisfying field of view (FOV) and image quality requirements while also maintaining acceptable weight, power and computational limits - this is especially true for satellites and UAV platforms. In response, IR&T has developed an innovative solution to this severe limitation through the use of an                                                                                         w concept of a beam-steerable, sparse array imaging interferometer for application to millimeter-wave radiometric imaging. The electronic mirror allows fewer, higher gain elements thereby reducing the overall antenna weight, power consumption and data analysis complexity. The electronic mirror provides the necessary control to increase the FOV while also providing flexibility to optimize image acquisition and quality in varying weather and tactical situations. The electronic mirror consists of an array of monolithic, solid-state, varactor diodes together with antennas and bias lines. The incident electromagnetic wave is steered through a progressive phase shift introduced across the array through a simple bias voltage. Monolithic fabrication results in the low-cost, high reliability essential for both the proposed military as well as commercial applications.",

Development of the camera will be carried out during Phase I of the program initially using a commercially-available signal analysis software package, and will consider detectors, signal processing techniques, readout methods, filters, and A/D systems.  The software model results will then be evaluated using discrete electronic elements on circuit boards, clocked using multiple output pulse generators.  In particular, DC rejection will be examined using switched  capacitor filtering, direct DSP filtering, and DSP-based matched filtering.  One of these discrete element mock-ups will be evaluated in pump/probe experiment, followed by a test of a fast linear array imager.

        "abstract": "In recent years the anti-submarine-warfare mission of the U. S. Navy has been expanded to include operations against stealthy, diesel-electric submarines operating in near-shore, shallow water regions of the world. Acoustic conditions in such regions are characterized by significant spatial and temporal variability.  This variability reduces the performance of traditional sonar detection and classification algorithms. Impulsive-source active sonar systems can provide sufficient acoustic energy to detect these targets, but also produce significant clutter in a shallow--water environment. Detection of too many false targets can quickly overload sonar operators, so that true enemy targets are not detected and  properly classified.  Our proposed research will use a combination of wavelet and nonparametric bootstrap methods to achieve improved performance for detection and classification. Bootstrap methods allow one to adaptively estimate the underlying probability distribution of interference in the non--Gaussian colored-noise environment typical of shallow-water active sonar, and to set detection thresholds  to maintain a desired false alarm rate. Subsequent target classification will be performed using wavelet representations of the sonar echoes, taking advantage of the time--frequency structure of targets and clutter.  These representations may be combined with existing discriminant analysis methods.  This work will demonstrate the feasibility of these techniques for sonar target detection and guide our phase II development of improved methods for detecting and classifying targets in the presence of clutter.",

The MCBS will be capable of operating at a 50 Hz pulse repetition rate, will occupy less than 0.5 cubic foot in volume, and will have a weight of less than 20 pounds.  The MCBS will be capable of simultaneous operation in the eyesafe (1.5-1.6 micron) band, and in the 8-12 micron band, and will have the capability of rapidly switching wavelengths within these bands at a 50 Hz, or greater, rate.  The MCBS will providetopographical CL measurements out to several kilometer ranges, and will have a range capability of at least 8 kilometers for aerosol clouds.  The main goal of the Phase I effort will be to demonstrate the feasibility of our transmitter design, thus providing the basis for Phase II system development.

        "abstract": "The aim of this effort is to inexpensively produce high performance strained-Si devices. The idea is to introduce strain into the Si lattice mechanically, and not via lattice mismatched, layered, heterostructures. Strain will be introduced by curving the ICs around a cylindrical packaging form. Using only standard fabrication techniques, integrated circuitry will be processed on thin single crystal Si membranes (20 - 50 microns thick). During the fabrication process, the membranes will be supported on standard Si wafer substrates and de-mounted afterwards. These flexible membranes can then be bent around cylindrical supports inducing uni-directional -tensile-strain. Enhanced electronic effects (mobility etc.) will be evident in devices which are appropriately aligned. Mechanically inducing the strain will circumvent the inherent problems in heterostructure fabrication. Initial calculations indicate the defect density will also be substantially reduced as the uni-directional-strain required for enhanced mobility is lower than that associated with dislocation formation. Mechanically straining the lattice after IC processing offers the possibility of a wide range of high speed devices in strained-Si, both unipolar and bipolar which are difficult to fabricate within the geometric confines of epitaxial device design. The applications are therefore in, inexpensive, high speed, strained-Si Devices.",

In addition, it will be extremely lightweight (density about 1g/cc), capable of high speed proportional response, and of being mass produced in sizes from the 0.6 mm3 Phase I prototype to very large devices.  Because of its symmetry the effector will not emit electromagnetic radiation during operation and it may also serve as a displacement sensor.

Two primary techniques are discussed: (a) simultaneous, long-dwell multibeam receive processing and (b) wideband,     udorandomly hopped frequency                                          employ multiple, wideband antenna elements each with a low-cost, wideband, digital receiver and heterogeneous digital signal processing to simultaneously perform SAR imaging and MTI detection.  A low frequency, wideband LFM waveform is synthesized by using a narrower band, pseudorandom, hopped waveform simultaneously supporting SAR and MTI.  The architecture provides for rejection of radio frequency interference prevalent at low frequencies and for space-time adaptive processing, jointly optimizing MTI clutter/interference rejection.  Displaced locations of VHF/UHF receivers for direction finding and sidelobe control are also supported.  Since the narrowband, hopped frequency waveform requires narrowband transmissions for discrete, interleaved time slots; frequency multiplexing can be used as a spectral management tool to interleave other receive-only functions such as SIGNIT.  Additionally, the multi-beam receive architecture inherently supports bistatic operation since it already employs multiple receive beams to instantaneously provide wide angular sector MTI coverage.  ISI will follow its commercialization plan that created the ImageExpress tm product from an earlier SBIR program.",

In many applications major difficulties arise because of the radio frequency interference (RFI) sources which can inadvertently or intentionally interfere with the operation of the SAR. Homogeneous processor architectures currently used to accomplish the real time SAR processing are ill equipped for the RFI mitigation function.  Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) and block floating point (BFP) devices have demonstrated substantial throughput (up by a factor of 10), size, weight, and power advantages over central processing units (CPU) such as the Power PC while maintaining wide dynamic range (>120dB).  Combining these specialized processing devices with general purpose CPUs into a heterogeneous processor has been shown to be feasible.  Therefore, Integrated Sensors, Inc.  (ISI) proposes to design an efficient COTS based heterogeneous parallel processor architecture and processing element optimized for real-time RFI detection and rejection.  Representative hardware components, such as SHARP's BDSP 9124 block floating point device and special purpose field programmable gate arrays (FPGA), will provide the basis of the proposed processing element.",

        "abstract": "In this proposal, Intelligent Automation Inc. (IAI) proposes an innovative new method of engine degradation monitoring, fault detection, and diagnostics, which is robust to sensor noise and is efficient in training and learning.  This innovation will also allow us to detect new fault conditions that have not occurred before.  This may include sensor failures and hence, the capability of validity self-checks.  We propose to use two neural networks: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Fuzzy CMAC. PCA is a powerful technique for extracting the features inside the input signals.  We have seen that PCA can reduce the signal dimension from 800 to 5 in several applications.  A major advantage of PCA is that supervised learning is unnecessary.  It can also be implemented in low-cost hardware.  The Fuzzy CMAC (Cerebellar Model Arithmetic Computer) inherits preferred features of arbitrary function approximation, fast learning, and parallel processing from the original CMAC neural network, and the capability of acquiring and incorporating human knowledge into a system and the capabilities of acquiring and incorporating human knowledge into a system and processing information from the fuzzy inference rules of fuzzy logic. Our learning rates are at least an order of magnitude faster than conventional neural nets.  The Universal Approximation Theorem that we have formally proven shows that any function can be learned to any degree of accuracy with enough learning cycles.  The proposed method is relevant to the subtopic because our innovation can provide an early warning before the system actually fails. The purpose is to increase time between overhaul and safety.",

        "abstract": "A unique thyristor laser implements a high performance Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) in a monolithic FET GaAs integrated circuit.  In the curent high speed FLASH ADC, the comparator circuit performs in the sampling on the input analog signal by comparing it to a voltage reference tree and the outputs are converted to binary form via a decimal to binary (DTB) algorithm stored in a ROM.  To achieve substantial increases in ADC accuracy, speed and circuit density, we propose a comparator based on an optoelectronic thyristor which is electrically switched and provides laser ouput as a VCSEL in the on state.  We introduce an elegant new architecture to implement the ADC function which merges the roles of the quantization, the DTB conversion and the O/E conversion within a simple integrated circuit.  One thyristor and one Differential amplifier are required per binary digit.  This new approach reduces the number of devices required for a 12 bit ADC from 100,000 to 70 and reduces the ADC delay from 50ns to 0.5ns.  The power is correspondingly reduced and the output is a digital optical signal in serial or parallel format.  The voltage resolution is in the 5mV range limited only by the dark current noise in the switch.  This approach provides a quantum leap in an N bit ADC speed because the output is obtained optically in the time that it takes the analog signal to ripple through N stages at 40ps/stage.  This technique promises to revolutionize the art of ADC and to provide the basis for very high speed image transfer for the future all digital network.  In addition to this novel conversion we also provide the integrated technology to realize the VCSEL thyristor, the FET amplifier and CCD sensor simultaneously.",

Its primary advantage over conventional computers is that it will function over an enormous range of temperatures, from very cold to near the melting point of the materials used in fabrication.  It will also be impervious to radiation.  In its standby mode, it will consume no power, and it is potentially less costly than conventional integrated electronics because the fabrication process is considerably simpler.  Yet it will be able to implement a full range of computing devices, including combinatorial logic, static RAMs, and clocked logic such as shift registers.  When used in conventional circuits, it has the potential to allow critical circuit connections to be made or broken without any control lines, or without any changes to the electronic circuit.

        "abstract": "A GaAs based integrated circuit is proposed as a means to implement optical network switching technology for phased array antennas (PAA) and ATM switching functions. The integrated technology offers a family of components in monolithic form and combinations of these devices can be used with an optical fiber input, to strip the header from the incoming optical signal and to use this routing information to set up a path for the optical data of the payload without O/E conversion.  This technology has produced vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (* 2 mA threshold), vertical cavity resonant detectors (0.6 A/W responsivity), high performance heterostructure field effect transistors (ft > 40 GHz) and waveguide absorption modulators (35:1 contrast) all using a common fabrication sequence. This technology is realized with a single epitaxial growth upon a GaAs substrate, and uses a single set of fabrication steps to realize a monolithic integrated circuit with electronics, emission, detection and modulation capability. A essential component for the all optical switching function is the HFET waveguide directional coupler switch. Using this switch for optical routing and controlling it with HFET logic, a high speed switching network can be realized. The other essential component for the self-routing function is the HFET modulator/detector which is able to remove the header by O/E conversion and then use the resulting electronic code to set up the optical switching path. These photonic circuits can implement a complete III-V chip set for an optical switching network. With this device compatibility, it is possible to implement the header removal, the header decode logic, the switch set-up circuits and the optical switching network within the area of a single integrated circuit. For the PAA, the headers contain the phase delay data for routing optical RF signals through a True Time Delay network and with sub-micron scaled devices, this function can be performed at data rates approaching 100Gb/s. In this program the integrated circuits for all optical signal routing with optoelectronic header conversion, decode and set-up for an optical switching network system with fiber inputs and outputs will be developed.",

However, present designs, such as arrayed waveguide grating router and commercial grating filters, are costly, passive, and have high losses.  Tuning to different wavelength channels is difficult to implement and low-speed, e.g., acousto-optic, tunable filters suffer from cross-talk, insertion loss, resolution and cost problems which make them unsuitable as high performance active ADMs.  This project will develop a new approach for in-line, all-fiber, compact, low-cost ADMs for selecting, adding, dropping and switching of wavelength channels in multi-wavelength systems.  This ADM combines three processes, each of which selectively changes fiber properties.  The result is a device with ultra-fast operation, high-selectivity, and low-loss, a combination of features not previously available.  Phase I will: (1) expand upon preliminary modeling to optimize the ADM design for networking, (2) fabricate, characterize and integrate the building-blocks for an active 4-port ADM, (3) construct an electro-optically controlled feasibility prototype ADM and characterize its wavelength selectivity, tunability and speed.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   The proposed all-fiber active 4-port ADMs, along with passive versions and other spin-off products, have significant market potential in communications (including internet) and sensors.  For example, the market for multi-wavelength communications systems is forecast to reach $4.4 billion by 2001, of which 15% is expected to be for ADMs.  Commercially available 4-port ADMs are expensive and limited to passive devices and to a few vendors.  Devices developed under this project would be low-cost with full fiber-optic compatibility, avoiding pigtailing and circulators._",

In computer vision, pattern recognition is frequently hampered by poor image segmentation.  Segmentation algorithms have not been able to segment an image as a human would, instead they form regions based on mathematically defined criteria. Because existing segmentation algorithms are underdeveloped, the segments they create do not benefit pattern recognition systems, which have enough problems recognizing an object, let alone recognizing an object that has not segmented accurately.  In IOS' dynamic system, low level sgementation results will feed forward omto an associative memory.  the associative memeory will feedback to the first level to adjust the segmentation results. Merging both tasks in a dynamically interacting system will create a powerful and accurate image segmentation tool for object recognition and machine vision applications.",

Intelligent Optical Systems proposes a decontamination towelette containing a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) that mimics the binding characteristics of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase.  The cost, shelf life, and storage conditions of a disposable towelette are important considerations.  Enzymes are best preserved at 40C, a temperature that poses logistical constraints  in. the field. In some instances, it is not easy to find a suitable biological source for the necessary enzymes.  They often require special handling to maintain their tertiary structure.  Organic solvents severely limit enzyme their usefulness.  Molecularly imprinted polymers bind to substrates (such as sarin) selectively because the binding sites and the substrate complement each other in size, shape, and chemical functionality. MIPs combine the advantages of easy tailor design with physical  and chemical stability, durability, and reactive  functionality.  The selectivities and affinities acquired from the molecular imprinting process are also on par, in many instances, with natural binding entities.  In Phase I, 105 will synthesize and test MIPs using paraoxon, an analog of sarin, and demonstrate MIPs' substrate binding potential for nerve gas decontamination.  In addition to providing a high-performance alternative to enzymes for decontamination, molecularly imprinted polymers will have excellent potential for biosensors.  Applications include the detection of explosives, toxic chemicals and biological agents, medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, chemical process control, food processing control, and biotechnology instrumentation.",

The hardware architecture design will be evaluated and down-selected from three major MEMS vendors using our high fidelity simulation environment while the software design architecture is selected implemented in such a way that it optimally provides the right data format and accuracy to meet range safety minimum requirements for the LV GPS receiver Data for the Space Lift Range System.  The robust filtering scheme consists of three key features: i) multiple model estimation scheme, ii) the adaptation of the noise statistics via an effective noise identification scheme, and iii) the estimation of both gyro and accelerometer bias vector by using the GPS receiver data as an external aiding sensor to in-flight calibrate the IMU.  GPS/INS tightly couples architecture is selected to provide robust navigation solution against poor satellite tracking, data latency, GPS dropout, etc.  The proposed concept is capable of 1) correcting the GPS errors via noise identification mechanism and 2) aiding the GPS to reduce acquisition times and velocity errors.",

However, with recent advances in modeling, simulation and autonomous with recent advances in modeling, simulation and autonomous agent technologies, the ability to model and simulate complex systems using a collection of simple, autonomous software agents that can be deployed concurrently has become entirely feasible.  The Phase I effort is directed to creating a system concept , implementation architecture, and Phase II implementation plan for an autonomous agent-based ABC forecasting tool.  The payoffs of such a tool are dramatic reduction in manufacturing costs and cycle time through: (a) early detection of non-value-added activities and waste; and (b) various ABC streamlining optimization strategies.

Almost all of these involve high temperature treatment of SiC, whether for growth, oxidation, or implant activation anneal. Unfortunately, under high temperature processing this material has demonstrated the occurrence of step bunching. This surface/interface roughness of course leads to increased carrier scattering, thereby degrading device performance. In general, the technique of reflectance anisotropy spectroscopy is sensitive to reduced symmetry at the surface, including steps; increased signal at some critical points has been found to be associated with step-like surface structures. However, the critical points for SiC occur for hvo 6eV, which is inaccessible to normal spectrometers. We therefore propose to develop a new means to characterize this surface/interface. This tool, Far Ultraviolet Reflectance Anisotropy Spectroscopy, offers promise of improved characterization of SiC surfaces, as well as those of other wide bandgap semiconductors such as GaN. This technique permits us to characterize step bunching as it occurs, as it is a non-contact optical technique permitting remote access.",

        "abstract": "Today, lead-acid batteries are used extensively as the primary stored energy medium.  Their performance capabilities have been well documented.  When used as the primary energy storage device to support sensitive electronics until a standby generator system is online, batteries are the weak link in the emergency power system.  Batteries must live in a controlled environment and require extensive maintenance; two major elements that are not always available.An alternative has been conceived to replace batteries as a stored energy system.  This alternative, known as the JDUPS or Hybrid Dynamic Uninterruptible power System, uses a solid steel flywheel to store kinetic energy and provides a rectified DC output.  Simple rules of physics govern the amount of stored energy, based upon flywheel diameter, face (thickness) and speed.  The HDUPS is based upon a standard robust motor generator set platform which can operate in variable frequency drive and a rectifier.  A prototype system in the 35 kVA range will be built to demonstrate a minimum 30 seconds of stored energy.  This technology is applicable to any market where users will no longer accept battery failures.",

Current methods for capturing instructor ratings of aircrew performance require either that instructors divert attention from observing on-going behaviors to make ratings on a paper form, or make ratings after completion of a flight or simulation based on recollection. The Instructor's Associate will take advantage of computer technology to develop a hand-held input-output device that is portable and convenient to use.  The device will record observations through an interface that facilitates the task of making ratings while minimizing demands on the instructor's attention.  The device will function as a passive recording device and as an intelligent associate that uses artificial intelligence technology to support performance rating.

        "abstract": "Since its invention, the video camera has been a valuable diagnostic tool for a wide variety of military, scientific and industrial applications. Recently with the advent of digital video and the growth associated with mass media and teleconferencing, the opportunity exists to take advantage of an emerging technology to develop a high performance data acquisition system which is capable of recording high resolution video images direcdy to a Fibre Channel network. By incorporating the Fibre Channel protocol into a flexible data acquisition architecture, a digital recorder can be developed with the ability to communicate directly with either a mass storage device, a display device or a variety of computer systems which support the Fibre Channel protocol. Such a device has been proposed as part of an automated video scoring system for the Aberdeen Test Center. A video scoring system has been developed which can control and record a minimum of four megapixel cameras via a Fibre Channel network. In addition, automated target scoring can be implemented by using several algorithms developed for radar and surveillance applications. A flexible design has been achieved allowing the recording unit to meet the immediate and future needs of the Aberdeen Test Center, as well as a variety of military and civilian recording applications.  BENEFITS:  The high-degree of flexibility designed into the direct-to-disk recorder allows it to be used for numerous data acquisition applications. The choice of Fibre Channel as the communication protocol allows the recorder to be implemented into any computer network operating this protocol and allows high resolution images to be transmitted over a digital network in real-time.",

The optical arrangement is based on classical physics and can be demonstrated with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components available from advances in Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS).  The Phase I effort is to provide bench top demonstration of the concept using COTS components.  Specific efforts shall include charcterization of the diode laser and the specific MEMS and other optical components, and their integration to achieve the desired results.

Corneal surgical procedures with the laser will be evaluated and the results used to guide laser design specifications for a commercial prototype, to be developed during Phase II.  If the proposed device satisfies clinical and commercial requirements, surgical correction of a wide variety of refractive errors may become more effective, safe and affordable.  By eliminating the need for eyeglasses and other corrective devices, the pool of potential military personnel can be increased, while the capabilities of current personnel can be strengthened.

Today's molecular biology and immunological detection technologies cannot be used to produce automated biodetectors useable in the battlefield.  New, improved detection technologies are needed to minimize the impact of chemical and biological weapons on Army personnel and provide a means to construct automated biodetectors that can identify a very few particles of any hazardous agent, regardless of interferant background. The final objective of the work proposed is to develop a highly sensitive RNA probe methodology to identify pathogenic bacteria and viruses.  The methodology will underlay the foundation of RNA based tests that will be easy to perform as a simple enzymatic reaction at 37 degrees C under isothermal conditions in a single test tube format and can identify less than 100 target molecules in a specimen.  Because of its extreme simplicity, the test could ultimately be incorporated into a small, portable, personal deviceuseable in battlefield environments without special training.

The resulting system would provide a  finely resolved image of the subject which would be viewed through an infrared filter (etalon) whose bandpass can be electronically controlled.  This unique capability would enable real time identification of CC&D targets by their infrared signatures regardless of their cloaking in the visible spectrum.  And as the original system was designed for use in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) it is lightweight, portable, and draws minimal power.",

        "abstract": "Research indicates that optical losses with current waveguides are several times worse than fiber optical cables.  Development of an on chip waveguide is hampered by evidence that etch generated sidewall damage causes interface scattering and is a major factor in reduced signal propogation.  On-chip waveguides must integrate with a variety of device types and process conditions.  For example, gallium arsenide based opto-electronic devices are sensitive to heat and plasma or dry etching.  When process and device issues, such as building coupling structures, are viewed together, it is evident that the major hurtles to optical interconnect are practical process/material integration issues.  Ionic Systems has over five years experience with room temperature plasma deposited low cost, organosilicon photo-oxidated compounds.  We propose to take advantage of the index of refraction changes in the exposed and unexposed material to fabricate on-chip waveguides with no subsequent etching.  This method of on-chip optical fabrication provides potential elimination of multiple deposition and patterning steps, and the waveguide thus generated will have excellent optical boundaries eliminating or drastically reducing losses during optical propagation.  The terms high performance, low loss, and etch free are inseparable for this process.  The variable index of refraction makes a new class of optical devices possible for integration of optical components such as prisms or gratings in the beam waveguide itself.",

Programmable intelligent digital electronics structures, such as the PRIDE system, are being developed to provide dynamic adaptation of the radio system physical layer functions to changes in link communications behavior.  Yet, to effectively allocate the medium access control and network layer resources of wireless links, a generic multiple access module and tool must be developed and integrated.  The purpose of this proposed work is to use IRI's innovative hybrid analytical and simulation techniques, integrated with the structure of the currently existing IRI \u00bfPlanyst\u00bf tool,   to develop in Phase I models and methods that can then be used in Phase II for the development of a software based generic multiple access prototype module and tool. This module can interact with the employed intelligent electronics system, and with the network management controllers. The proposed module incorporates the traffic and quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of realtime and non-realtime applications, the inputs provided from radio links and the PRIDE system, and other network signals, to best select and tune-up the multiple-access system operation in sharing the available radio link and network resources.  It will serve as a tool for planning, analysis, management, control, and resource allocation of hybrid wireless and wired network systems, under application based QoS guarantees.  Applications include Navy and Marine Corps JMCOMS ADNS, GCCS, JDISS, Link-11, TADIL, Battle Group RF LOS and SATCOM, Tactical Force Battle Management, NGFS, SAR, AAW, and ASuW network systems.",

This is especially true in the mechanics of focus, iris control, and pointing.  However the eye is a good model for the features which should be emulated in a next generation sensor.  Electronic and signal processing emulation techniques have already been demonstrated.  As higher and higher resolution sensors are implemented an electronically steerable \u00bffovea\u00bf can be contemplated in a wide field of view optical system.  This combined with on and near the focal plane processing could provide a sensor with eye type capabilities.  Those include: wide field of view, staring sample rates, image resolution enhancement through saccadic motion and image motion compensation, spatial and temporal pre-filtering, and fovea resolution enhancement in the area of most interest.  ISC plans to architect such a sensor in the Phase I program using its Z-technology focal plane architecture and Vector Image Processor technology for signal processing.  A novel on focal plane pixel summing (hyperpixel) technique will be used for the majority of the focal plane array in order to reduce output bandwidth, except in an electronically steerable fovea area where high resolution is required.",

Casteel, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG03-98ER82601\nAmount:  $74,754\n\nCdTe-based photovoltaic (PV) devices are limited in conversion efficiency by the CdS window layer which absorbs light but does not convert it into electricity.  High efficiency PV laboratory cells minimize CdS absorption by using thin CdS layers, but too thin a layer of CdS can lead to low voltage devices and yield problems.  Thin CdS is therefore not practical for large area, high throughput manufacturing.  This project will develop a high resistivity tin oxide (HRT) coating on the transparent front electrode of the CdTe PV device.  When properly formulated and deposited, HRT enables use of CdS films which absorb minimal amounts of solar insolation while producing PV devices with high voltage.  This project will identify the specific electrical and optical properties required of HRT to produce CdTe/thin CdS devices, develop formulations and deposition procedures to produce films with the desired properties.  The technical and economic potential will be evualuated for incorporation of HRT into commercial production.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   HRT will increase efficiency and decrease costs, thereby providing a significant boost to CdTe PV\u00bfs emergence into the 126 MW/yr commercial PV market and advance DOE\u00bfs PV program goals of achieving 15% module efficiency at $0.50/Wp._",

The first approach uses direct detection.  A 95 Ghz Image Intensifier and a special bolometric FPA obtain passive images at 94 Ghz and in the IR spectral region (8-12 mm).  The image intensifier uses an amplifier array with a gain of only 26.8 dB as compared to 40 dB required on existing systems.  The bolometric array is fabricated via low cost thin film processes.  The second approach uses a single quasi-optically injected LO on an array of Schottky mixers and IF amplifiers.  The mixer array and IF amplifier array are fabricated using MMIC technology.  The single LO greatly reduces the cost of the heterodyne receiver array.  The third receiver employs a CW illuminator and the special bolometric FPA to enhance the image scene at 94 Ghz.  This system is capable of both MMW and IR imaging.  All three approaches provide greater than 10 x 15 degree FOR at 16msec frame rates and a NETD of 1K or less.

        "abstract": "The end product of this proposal is an improved monopropellant which is safe, non toxic, water soluble, very low cost, energetic, environmentally benign and wakeless.  Calculations show that a stoichiometric blend of the water soluble constituents produce a monopropellant having an energy density of 1100 Btu/# (British thermal units per pound) and an adiabatic flame temperature of 2300 F (Fahrenheit).  This monopropellant is projected to be insensitive to impact up to and including the shock imposed from military rifle fire.  Experimental determinations and verifications of physical properties and of stability of the monopropellant are proposed in Phase I.  Drop weight impact testing will demonstrate the insensitivity of the monopropellant to mechanical shock at levels below those encountered in blasting cap tests.  Also in Phase I a proprietary technique will be demonstrated which prevents any possible detonation should the monopropellant rise above a selected temperature during the most severe test of Mil-Std-2105, the cook off or bonfire test.  In the Phase I Option, preliminary combustion tests are proposed in the Alternate Fuels Combustion Test Fixture.  Also, scaled safety tests will be performed as precursors to the full scale Mil-Std-2105 tests scheduled in Phase II.",

Working with the CABS contractor, the Aviation Applied Technology Directorate, and Aircrew Integrated Systems, the Jaycor team will: (1) Evaluate candidate occupant position sensor technologies; (2) Produce conceptual designs of safety interlock and sensor systems for the UH-60 and AH-64 CABS; (3) Develop and build a breadboard safety interlock controller with sensors; and (4) Demonstrate the potential effectiveness of the safety interlock system through computer crash simulations using the Articulated Total Body Code, through Jaycor's biomechanics database for head/neck injuries, and through actual operation of the breadboard system.  Continuous monitoring by position sensors in a safety interlock system allows ten times more time, about 100 to 200ms, for sensing aviator position and deciding whether to deploy air bags than systems that must decide instantaneously during a crash.  Our goal for the CABS safety interlock development program is to help protect aviators from serious air bag injuries with zero scheduling and cost impact on any of the ongoing or planned CABS programs.  This will be achieved through close coordination with the CABS contractor, AATD, and ACIS.  BENEFITS:  Expected benefits for the Army include a means of protecting helicopter crewmen from serious air bag injuries in crashes. Commercial markets include technology needs for second-generation automotive occupancy sensors and for monitoring and classification of people for other modes of transportation and for security systems.",

The procedure will involve the selection or the synthesis of heat and moisture resistant resins and curing agents; the development of optimum silane content on the filler surfaces via FTIR; the formulation of restorative/impression materials utilizing above components and the characterization of the formulated products. For restoratives, modified Bis-GMA analogues and/or diluents having optimurn viscosity, hydrophobicity and reactivity will be used to mix with properly silanated siliceous fillers, stable initiators, accelerators and stabilizers. For polyether impression, bulky carbocationic initiators will be tried in lieu of conventionally used aryl sulphonate esters. For polyvinylsiloxane impression. use of either hydrido-silanes having bulkier derivatives as cross-linkers or inorganic/organometallic catalysts or combinations will be explored. Changes in viscosity, curing parameters and mechanical properties such as hardness, tear and flexural-strength will be monitored under different temperature and humidity conditions to make shelf-life predictions. Development of one part vinyl impression material will be investigated to further enhance the shelf stability. The immediate benefits will be shared by the government and the taxpayers. Long-term benefits are the development of storage stable, new products, that will find wide acceptance in the dental community worldwide.",

With no moving parts in the conversion process, these direct current generators promise quiet and reliable operation.  With their capacity to utilize logistic fuels, they have the potential to meet the military's emerging requirement for portable battery charging units in the field.  JX Crystals has developed key components for thermophotovoltaic systems and has performed extensive public demonstrations of its prototypes.  The key to the company's approach is the use of low cost infrared-sensitive photovoltaic cells and an emitter matched to these cells.  Building on the company's development of propane fired systems for the commerical market, this proposal calls for delivery of a 20 Watt field-ready battery charger operating on propane or butane.  In anticipation of phase II requirements, liquid fuel options will be investigated for both 20 Watt and 200 Watt battery chargers.  Phase I will include demonstration of a liquid fuel burner for the 20 Watt system.  Under a subcontract, the Tecogen division of Thermo Power will draw on its experience with liquid fuel fired thermoelectric generators to design a liquid fuel burner for a 200 Watt thermophotovoltaic system.

        "abstract": "KaZaK Composites Incorporated (KCI) proposes to develop critical material technologies for high expansion ratio tactical shelters.  The critical material and component requirements are developed by formulating shelter concepts meeting the habitability, operational deployment, and loading requirements outlined in the solicitation.  It is shown that the critical material technologies will be in the construction of lightweight, high stiffness panels for roof, sidewalls, and floor of this shelter.  It is further shown that integrally stiffened panels have significant operational and packaging advantages for this shelter concept.  Novel sandwich technologies including hybrid foam/composite cores and open cellular construction also promise important advantages for a 12:1 expansion ratio shelter.  In order to produce the desired shelter components at affordable prices, KCI proposes extensive ost/performance/processing tradeoffs during Phase I.  These tradeoffs will include applicable manufacturing processes such as RTM, SCRIMP, and Pultrusion.  These tradeoffs allow cost- and performance-effective materials and components to be selected for fabrication and testing in Phase I.  The components tested will include principally skin panels subjected to ending, impact, joint integrity, and thermal insulation testing.  The results of said testing will be fed back into the shelter design analysis to update and confirm shelter configurations to be pursued during Phase II.  BENEFITS:  Material developments achieved under this project will have significant benefit to KCI commercial refrigerated container design development.  The overall high expansion ratio shelter concept will further have wide applicability to disaster relief and refugee housing by the Red Cross, UN, and other international aid groups.",

Smart Elements are low cost, continuously-produced pultruded composite lineal shapes (such as a rod) which combine three elements of smart or active control structure - the composite structural element, a continuously distributed piezoelectric actuator, and the electrode structure to energize the actuator. With the addition of sensor and control electronics, a complete                                      d. This provides one to two orders of magnitude improvement in vibration control through the use of active damping and embedded shape control, all at very significant weight and costs savings compared with traditional spacecraft design practice. Smart Elements are possible through two recent developments - availability of piezoelectric materials such as PZT in fiber form and advances in state-of-the-art for the pultrusion process which can accommodate such brittle fiber forms. KaZaK and its Principal Investigator are experienced in this field, having produced the first pultruded composite with an embedded piezoceramic actuator in 1991 very similar to the smart structure now commercially used in the ski industry.",

As part of a previous Phase II conducted for the Air Force, KCI designed and built what we believe to be the world's largest and most capable pultrusion machine. This machine is optimized specifically for fabrication of very low cost composite panels up to 10 feet wide. Because pultrusion is the least costly method for making constant cross section composite structures, the pier decking designs developed during this proposed program are expected to use that as the manufacturing process of choice.   During Phase I we will develop several alternatives for deck concepts, each one involving a different combination of materials and geometry. Finite element analysis will be used to size each candidate to pier design loads. Manufacturing procedures will be conceptualized, and estimates for production cost of each option will be developed.  KCI will also demonstrate the possibility of embedding fiber optic strain sensors in the composite structure during the pultrusion process in order to provide the ability for in-service health monitoring.",

Current recycling technologies are based on industrial waste treatment methods, but aquaculture facilities require less expensive methods and a much higher degree of treatment.\n\nWe will evaluate an advanced concept for closed system aquaculture in which fish are held at high densities in intensive raceways or tanks, while a large fraction of the culture water is cycled through a series of extensive ponds for water treatment. This Pondway concept combines university research efforts of scientists a Clemson University with private industry research at Aquatic systems. The concept may result in more efficient production at lower costs because the culturist can control the fishes' environment, accelerate growth rates, supplement oxygen levels, maximize feeding , and treat diseases in the intensive sections, while also reducing water treatment costs in the pond sections. Without fish present, the pond section scan be managed solely to treat water and a 300-600% increase in water treatment capacity appears possible.",

Once completed the models will be exercised to define the usable operating envelope. A set of laboratory experiments will then be accomplished that demonstrate the application of the technique to a moving platform and to demonstrate its use as a three dimensional measurement tool.

Phase I will result in the initial design and prototype and will also address the issues related to a Phase II implementation.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The well drilling industry spent nearly $11 Billion in 1997 in drilling-related costs.  This industry can realize big cost savings by significantly reducing training costs, improving productivity, and increasing the safety of the human operators and oil wells by using MIDAS technology._",

        "abstract": "Today's manufacturing companies are concentrating their energy towards breaking the barriers between firms all along the supply chain to create a virtual enterprise whose goal is to operate as if the chain was a single entity. Breaking these barriers involves facilitating collaboration and communication at all levels of the enterprise. A key roadblock to this sort of facilitation is the need for a computer system interoperability that enables manufacturers and product suppliers to move and share information up and down the supply chain. \n\nIn this project, we propose to implement a framework for developing and maintaining an information translator for the entire supply chain. The translators generated by the framework will not only enable the exchange of properly formatted data, but will take into account the meaning of data during the translation. The key innovations of this project are: (1) the use of ontologies to enable information translation, (2) foundations for ontology harmonization, (3) semantic translation through inferences, and (4) automated generation and management of translators. The technology developed in this project will enable companies to cost- and time-effectively integrate their ERP and ERM systems with their suppliers' stand-alone software applications.",

These limitations impact electronic commerce, competitive reprocurement, and maintenance. None of the many raster to vector conversion products produce parametric vector drawings (PVD).  In PVDs, the text and symbols are bidirectionally associated with the drawings geometry, so a change to a dimension will cause a change to the geometry of the drawing.  Conversely, in a vector drawing, a change to a dimension will have no effect on the geometry.  In fact, some raster to vector products convert the text into vectors, so they are not even understanding the text.  KBSI is currently developing technology that will allow furthur processing to convert the vector file to a solid file format.  The availability of this tool will increase the value and extend the usefulness of existing legacy data, as well as, decrease maintenance cost.

A unified approach for designing decision support systems that support data fusion can make an enormous difference in the ease and efficiency of the decision making. The proposed approach for this SBIR effort involves the development of an intelligent adaptive data fusion system using soft computing paradigms including neural networks, fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms.

The methodology (1) provides an estimate of the system requirements and operation environments for each application specific material/structure, (2) establishes the critical response modes, (3) provides a framework for the development of detailed physical models for the critical response, (4) establishes the procedures to verify and validation of the response model, (5) identifies the required material property tests and the necessary validation tests, (6) selects the AGT environments and techniques for the material property and validation experiments, and (7) a vulnerability statement for the material for the specific application.  The use of the Damage-Response Mode Matrix (DRM) to define the critical response modes minimizes the model development, material characterization and validation necessary to develop a confident vulnerability statement for a new material in a specific application.  The methodology will be used to develop a program plan for the evaluation of two sets of new application specific structures/materials in a Phase II program.  Full utilization of recent advances in computing technology, x-ray simulator development and simulator diagnostics will be made in the development and implementation of the methodology.  The methodology provides for the generation of the data (analysis and test) necessary to evaluate the vulnerability of a material/structure introduced into a strategic and tactical military system as a result of maintenance and life cycle procedures.

Recent developments in adaptive antenna technologies have been developed and successfully applied for antennas in L-band communications.  Similar to 'phased array' technology, these adapative electronic arrays provide electronically steerable azimuth and elevation coverage by generating a number of discrete narrow beams using high speed digital switching technology.  The design, manufacturing techniques and digital switching offer dramatically lower production cost and improved performance repeatability over existing phased array technology.  Combining KVH's proven experience of rate stabilization and closed loop tracking, and adapting the design of military applications, promises to create the first truly affordable mil qualified, flat panel, land mobile multi-band system.  KVH will add to the basic flat panel array technology a three axis stowable actuator based tilt drive for low satellite elevation useage.  The anticipated price point of the 2            er prototype system will be less than $10,000.  BENEFITS:  This research and development effort will adapt state-of-the-art miniaturized electronics sensor and adapative antenna technology to provide a lower cost and size full duplex satellite on-the-move communications antenna.  As KVH's ASAP (Active Stabilized Antenna Pedestal) has proven (1995/96/97 sales of $12 mil. & 6000 unit qty.) such a device would have broad applications for improved land mobile satellite communications.  The proposed system will have multi-use applications in military operations, law enforcement, other government and commercial communication with internet communication type capability at the end of Phase II.",

This proposal addresses this problem by developing a lossless compression algorithm that is optimized for hyperspectral imagery.  Hyperspectral imagers generate 3-D data whose two axes correspond to spatial directions and the third to spectral response.  The proposed solution exploits the latest results in lossless image compression by performing a reversible multiresolution decomposition of the data along the spatial axes.  For extracting the redundancies in the spectral axis, one of three choices is proposed.  The first is based on the principal component analysis, modified to ensure reversibility of the transformation.  The second is based on cross-spectral prediction and the last on an integer multiresolution decomposition in the spectral direction.  An experimental setup is proposed to pick the best candidate solution over a range of sample data.  The transformed data is efficiently encoded by means of a contextual arithmetic encoder.Lossy compression is possible in a simple extension of the lossless technique.  In addition the algorithm permits progressive transmission.  The computational requirement of the algorithm is reasonable, and encoding the decoding complexities are nearly symmetric.",

        "abstract": "Very high data rate optical communications technologies are required by the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization and by the telecommunications industry for integration into future networks and autonomous systems. Laser Power Corporation (LPC) offers a unique diode laser pumped solid state laser technology that enables maximum possible system information rates at the highly desired 1.5 um wavelength band utilizing dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM). This laser technology allows production of monolithic high data rate transmitter modules with higher power, lower noise and narrower linewidth than competing semiconductor systems. In addition to all of the advantages offered by solid state lasers, the LPC 1.5 um lasers have chirping capability (self-frequency modulation) which allows the suppression of nonlinear propagation effects such as stimulated Brilliuon scattering (SBS) in long fiber runs.",

Howver, displays to date have been limited in brightness, resolution, and chromaticity.  Recent developments with AMLCD technology, based upon subtractive color promise high brightness, high resolution, and full color HMD's, suitable for operational environments.  Laser Power Corporation has identified red, green and blue microlasers as ideal illumination sources for the HMD.  Microlasers offer several advantages over are lamps as the illumination source, related to9 the spectral purity of the laser light and the near diffraction limited beam which makes the lasers will suited for use as a light source with LCD's.  Therefore, LPC is proposing the development of red and green lasers coupled with the fiber optic delivery bundle.  During Phase I, LPC will develop the laser configuration and demonstrate key technologies.  This will lead to a design for an integrated laser illumination system which will be delivered as part of the Phase II program.  This package will then be ready for full-scale engineering and MIL qualification, leading to production of a rugged microlaser system.",

        "abstract": "There is a great deal of interest in the development of new laser materials.  We propose to introduce a new powerful technique, combinatorial synthesis, to investigate new laser materials with multidopants.  Two independent variables, the dopants and their concentrations, are deposited in a multilayer system with the host crystal components.  The proposed dopants will be Cr, Ho, Er and Tm while their concentrations will be 0 at%, 1 at%, 5 at% and 10 at%.  A large number (576) of combinations on one crystal host can be achieved with the combinatorial synthesis technology using this number of independent variables.  This process will be applied to the crystal hosts YVO4 and Gd3Sc2Al3O12, which are well known and promising laser host materials that can be grown in bulk form with laser quality.  The two multilayered specimens will be annealed at low (a few hundred degrees centigrade) and high (1300 degrees centigrade) temperatures in air for high-speed absorption and fluorescent measurements using a special screening method.  The most promising compositions will be grown in single crystal fiber form using the laser heated pedestal growth (LHPG) technique.  The LHPG technique is an excellent complementary tool to the combinatorial synthesis technique.  Small samples of single crystals can be rapidly grown for more detailed examination of the interesting compositions identified by the combinatorial synthesis method.",

Specifically, we will investigate a vibrometer based on photo-emf detection, in conjunction with conventional rotational tracking.  The vibrometer incorporates a reference-beam interferometer to provide optical signals to the photo-emf detector.  We believe that this type of vibrometer is significantly less susceptible to undesirable signals and added noise that compromise the performance of conventional Doppler vibrometers.  We will describe preliminary experiments which support this point of view.  During the program we will characterize and optimize our interferometer, leading to a direct side-by-side comparison with a Doppler instrument.   At the conclusion of the Phase I effort we plan to demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of our approach, which should result in a robust, low-cost scanning device which can interrogate diffuse surfaces with minimum impact from the beam rotation process.",

Biggs, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG03-98ER82607\nAmount:  $75,000\n\nLong term measurements of the sequestration of carbon by vegetative and oceanic ecosystems are required on a wide scale to understand and quantify their role in the carbon balance of the atmosphere.  Such measurements require carbon dioxide sensors that are both accurate and robust.  This project will design and build an open path sensor for the measurement of carbon dioxide and water vapor that has the necessary response and resolution for measuring fluxes by eddy covariance.  This would allow the use of battery and or solar sources, give longer time between manintenance, and permit standardization of sensors.  In Phase I the necessary characteristics of such a sensor will be determined, the optics and electronics required to achieve or exceed those specifications will be designed, and a working test platform to verify the design will be built.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   Networks of sites are being formed around the world to measure fluxes of trace gasses above natural ecosystems.  This sensor would greatly enhance the viability and usefulness of these networks, by providing rapid, robust measurements of carbon dioxide and water vapor._",

        "abstract": "This program is designed to establish the feasibility of developing a directly transfusable cryopreserved Red Blood cell  (RBC)  product.  The approach of Lifecell's program is to utilize oxidative control and specific biocompatible water-structuring molecules to induce the formulation of non-damaging vitreous ice when frozen.  These concepts will reduce the requirement for non-specific cryoprotection,  thereby allowing the replacement of glycerol with ultimate transfusable cryoprotectants at low concentration.  The resulting RBC product will be directly transfusable following thaw.  Eliminating the necessary post-thaw  wash protocol provides significant benefits over any preservation technologies that are not directly transfusable.   These benefits  include decreased cost, immediate availability, improved transportability and extend post-thaw storage time.  The development of a simple, directly-transfusable RBC product will represent an important contribution to solving the critical blood banking problems associated with delivering safe and effective  blood transfusions in variety of medical situations, both civilian and military.  Successful development of this product will deliver a cryopreserved RBC having the following properties: 1.  Logistically simple processing which integrates  standard blood banking methods 2.  Direct transfusion following storage, requiring no post-thaw wash 3.  Non-toxic components, allowing for direct transfusidn 4.  High recovery of cell number with normal circulatory half-life, efficient oxygen delivery and low hemolysis Successful completion of this RBC program (following Phase  II  and III development) will provide a means for cost-effective  and  convenient cryopreservation of RBC.  The final RBC product, being directly-transfusable without cryoprotectant removal, will solve a major problem in civilian and military blood banking.",

        "abstract": "Third-harmonic generation (THG) of cw-diode-pumped solid-state lasers can be used to reach important wavelengths in the visible and ultraviolet.  Because THG is implemented with two cascaded processes of second-harmonic generation (SGH) and sum-frequency generation (SFG) and the peak power of cw-diode-pumped solid-state lasers is low, efficient THG is difficult with conventional nonlinear materials.  The emerging technology of periodic poling provides high nonlinearity and no walk-off so large nonlinear drive can be attained even with relatively low-peak-power lasers.  Using the flexible design properties possible in periodically poled materials, a monolithic crystal can be fabricated that combines both the SHG and SFG processes in a single crystal. This has the advantage of reducing the number of surfaces which lowers the loss.  By placing a crystal of this type in a resonant cavity, efficient THG of cw-diode-pumped solid-state lasers is made practical.This Phase I research will demonstrate a monolithic THG crystal using periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) and efficient THG of a cw-diode-pumped Nd:YAG laser.  In addition, we will investigate low-absorption material which will enhance the conversion efficiency and power handling of THG devices.  We will characterize the absorption of different samples of congruent and stoichiometric lithium niobate, and investigate the suitability of these materials for periodic poling.",

A high-powered shepherd pulse launched with the signal wavelengths exploits the nonlinear response of the optical fiber to cancel dispersion and thus prevent temporal dephasing of synchronous signal bits. In this Phase I proposal, Lightwave Microsystems will design and fabricate integrated optoelectronic components related to the bit-parallel network. These elements include a 2x2 optical switch and 1:8 splitter based on directional couplers, and a 4-channel multiplexer/demultiplexer based on arrayed waveguide grating technology operating at 1550 nm. Samples of these three devices will be delivered to Dr. Larry Bergman at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where they will be tested. The tests will determine the devices' applicability to the bit-parallel network, and how the shepherd pulse interacts with the optical devices. At the conclusion of this Phase I proposal, a preliminary design will be created for integrating the switch, splitter, and multiplexer to create 6x6 switching node for the bit-parallel network.",

        "abstract": "Detecting changes in two-dimensional scenery requires three essential components:  detection/recognition of object, computation of relative motion, and fast, compact processors to carry out the required numerical calculations.  Traditionally, most emphasis is placed on the first two software components.  A problem is that processing large 2-D arrays is a complex task reireing board level hardware.  An attractive alternative approach to simply considering improved software, is to reconsider the hardware in conjunction with software algorithms.  We have recently conceived of a novel spectral processor based upon reduced bit depth logic.  Originally developed as a means for very rapid calculations of frequency (Doppler)  spectra for laser radar applications, it appears that the same type of hardware processor can be applied to image correlation, and hence detection of motion within images.  We propose to carry out further analysis of this processor in Phase I, with particular emphasis on extending correlation calculations to two dimensions.  we also plan to build a scaled-down 1-D processor in Phase I, in order to demonstrate the viability of carrying out full-scale development in Phase II.",

Given this data, rain attenuation and link availability for a given link margin can be predicted more accurately.     In Phase I, LinCom will implement a number of the existing rain models including the NASA LeRC-SLAM model for selected locations.  Results will be verified using published ACTS measurements and other published reference material as required for verification.  During this phase, global weather data collection will begin as a prerequisite for Phase II where a global weather database will be developed.  A system requirements review will also be performed to preview the Satcom tool.     For Phase II, LinCom will develop a window based software package leveraging off existing Satcom tools LinCom has developed for the EHF community.

        "abstract": "Due to the limited availability of space onboard the AF jets, it is necessary to miniaturize all the components.  Oxygen generation devices are very bulky.  Especially, pressure-swing adsorption (PSA) units that yield relatively pure (90+%) oxygen, occupy large space, contain moving parts and are very inefficient.  The development of lightweight, compact, energy-efficient, high-purity (99.9+%) on-board oxygen generator has been an elusive and difficult goal to attain.  The use of ceramic membranes for oxygen generation/separation is an attractive solution to this problem.  During the oxygen generation using ceramic membranes, oxygen ions are conducted across the membrane from ambient air-side to pure oxygen-side; this process occurs at high temperatures.  As a result, there are several technical challenges which need practical solutions.  These challenges insclude thermal expansion mismatch between various components, membrane seals, thermal management, module optimization, and others.  LoTEC, Inc. has developed a unique design to address these challenges.  Based on this design, LoTEC, in cooperation with its subcontractor, NexTech, proposes to develop an on-board oxygen generation system (OBOGS) which is compact, efficient, and free of several technical hurdles.",

Vessels incorporating in-bed tubes for heat transfer also produce thermal gradients within the bed resulting in less than optimum heat transfer and reduced fuel gas output.  This project will demonstrate the feasibility of combining a jetting fluidized-bed, water-gas generator using biomass (as well as other opportunity fuels) with a slowly moving-bed of sorbent to remove carbon dioxide and fines from the water-gas product.  The goal is to produce the greatest hydrogen yields (at near 100%) per unit of vessel volume.  A bench scale version of the water gas generator apparatus has already been successfully tested.  During Phase I, fines carryover and carbon dioxide removal efficiency will be accurately measured under rigorously controlled conditions in order to verify carbon dioxide and fines removal efficiencies.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   By maximizing hydrogen production per mole of carbon dioxide, this continuous water-gas generator should have application in electric power generation where minimizing atmospheric carbon dioxide release is important.  Also, refinery waste streams and municapal waste sludges (coke and heavy bottoms) could be converted into valuable feed stock streams (hydrogen, CO2, NaHS). _",

        "abstract": "Success in the battlefield requires extensive distribution of near-real-time data amongst all levels of war fighters. Distribution may be limited by terrain, obstacles in the communication path, or by the impending risk to human life. Unmanned vehicles extend the range of distribution, while reducing the risk of casualties, by providing a platform for non-line-of-sight communication relay systems. Laser-communication technologies permit the realization of high-bandwidth, secure communication links via light, compact payloads suitable for airborne relays. We have developed satellite transceivers that use a solid-optic design to reduce size, weight, and cost and to ensure high reliability and availability.  Our commercial laser-communication products provide point-to-point communications at high data rates for situations in which communication links are impractical or overly expensive. On this program, we will extend our successful work on laser-communication systems by addressing requirements unique to airborne, non-line-of-sight lasercom relays. We will then determine the optimum laser communication system for video transmission in this environment and provide a comparison with alternative technologies.  BENEFITS:  The need for non-line-of-sight video transmission is not peculiar to military applications; it also exists in law enforcement, environmental monitoring, and hazardous waste-site management. Therefore, concepts and technologies selected on this program will yield significant benefits to military, industrial, and government organizations.",

This project will use a novel gaseous procedure to decontaminate contaminated facilities in situ, eliminating secondary waste.  This new procedure will be thorough, easy, inexpensive, environmentally safe and rapid.   The objective of this project is to demonstrate that gaseous ozone is an effective method for the decontamination of facilities containing high explosives.  Gaseous ozone will be pumped into a sealed facility and allowed to set for a predetermined length of time -- from 1 to 7 days.  During that time, the gaseous ozone will permeate the entire building, destroying high explosives in ceiling tile, ventilation systems, and cracks and crevices in the walls and floors.  Phase I will demonstrate that gaseous ozone can successfully destroy high explosive surrogates.  The oxidative decomposition of the surrogates will also scrutinized for the presence of intermediates.  When possible, the identity of the intermediates will be identified.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   Potential commercial applications include using gaseous ozone to decontaminate any DOE, DoD, or private facility contaminated with explosives or other munitions.  Gaseous ozone also has the potential to decontaminate chemical and biological warfare agents.  Other applications include clean rooms in the semiconductor industry, sterilization of medical instruments, disinfection of hospital rooms to control the spread of infection diseases, disinfection and disposal of medical waste, cleaning processing areas for specialty chemicals, decontaminating pesticide production facilities, and fumigation of pesticide contaminated fruits, vegetables, and grains._",

        "abstract": "Proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells are promising for applications such as portable power sources for Individual Soldiers due to their high efficiency, high power to weight and power to volume ratios, and fast start-up property.  However, most hydrogen/air (oxygen) PEM fuel cell stacks require significant support hardware for air supply, hydrogen storage/delivery system, and humidification.  The proposed direct methanol fuel cell stacks based on monopolar design with internal methanol storage eliminates all of these.  The use of monopolar design with an ambient air cathode will eliminate the need for an air handling system, and significantly reduce the cost and weight of the key components in the PEM fuel cell stack.  The use of methanol (liquid fuel) and an internal methanol storage system for stack will eliminate the bulky hydrogen storage/delivery system, reduce the methanol crossover, and simplify the heat management of the fuel cell stack.  This rugged, innovative direct PEM fuel cell stack is capable of operating at ambient temperatures and pressures, and requires no preconditioning or clean-up of the air supply.  BENEFITS:  A small, lightweight, and rugged PEM fuel cell power system has promising commercial applications wherever clean, quiet portable power is desired.

Discovery of new materials with the                                                  ming and rather unpredictable trial-and-error process.  This proposal describes a unique way of synthesizing and testing new permanent magnetic materials.  A combinatorial approach utilizing thin film deposition techniques and a recently developed scanning superconducting quantum interface device (SQUID) microscope will be used to quickly prepare and screen thin film combinatorial libraries.  A 256-member combinatorial library of RxMyQy (R = rare-earth, M = 3d transition metals, and Q = B, N), will be generated by combining sequential dc sputtering deposition of thin films with a series of 4 physical shadow masks.  The resulting libraries will be magnetized and screened for remanent magnetization by using the scanning SQUID microscope.  This powerful microscope will allow us to screen large libraries of compounds fairly quickly to identify potential candidates for further development.  The goal of Phase I is to demonstrate the feasibility of our combinatorial approach for synthesis and identification of hard magnetic materials.",

        "abstract": "Due to the reduction in the resources available for replacement along with changes in the USAF mission, a half of military aircraft, already over 20 years old, are expected to be in service for much longer than they were designed to last.  One of the major problems found in operations with aging aircraft is the cost associated with corrosion.  A reliable corrosion rate measurement system can control corrosion maintenance, reduce the maintenance cost, and predict the residual life of a corroded aircraft part.  There are a  variety of nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques to detect corrosion damages of aging aircraft structures; however, those techniques currently in use cannot measure corrosion rate of the structures.  New innovative methods to measure corrosion rate in aircraft structures are needed.  Lynntech, Inc. will design and develop a novel advanced NDE corrosion rate measurement system for aging aircraft structures based on electrochemical impedance (EI).  The proposed NDE system, to be completely developed in the Phase II, will be simple, portable, inexpensive, highly reliable, and very sensitive to small corrosion defects in the aircraft structures.  During the Phase I, a lab mode of the corrosion rate measuring system will be developed, and the proof of concept will be demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "The continuous search for alternatives to halons as fire suppressants, necessitated by the Montreal Protocol ban on ozone depleting substances, has yielded a few potential replacements.  However, these chemically acting agents still pose unresolved toxicity questions and/or are not as effective as halons.This Phase I proposal offers a revolutionary approach to suppress fire by exposure to spectrally selective light.  To meet this objective, a four-task work plan is proposed.  It includes:  (1) Prospective light wavelength(s) for fire suppression will be identified from spectroscopic investigation of light emission from a corona discharge induced by electromagnetic pulse which has already exhibited fire extinction capabilities;  (2) Computer modeling will be utilized to assist in the selection of the most promising wavelength(s);  (3) Hydrocarbon flames established over a Bunsen burner and/or a counterflow apparatus will be exposed to laser light at the selected wavelengths.  Fire suppression will be quantified in terms of reduction is burning velocity (Bunsen) and/or stain rate (counterflow); and  (4) A conceptional design of a fire suppression prototype will be rendered based on the experimental and modeling results.Successful demonstration of the principle along with a fundamental understanding of the underlying mechanisms for fire suppression by light will provide a technical foundation for a comprehensive Phase II R&D, leading to a design and construction of a prototype for field demonstration.",

        "abstract": "A new class of miniaturized munitions will play a key role in future warfighting scenarios by providing precision strikes to an array of high-value targets.  To meet this need, weapons such as the Small Bomb System (SBS), Low Cost Autonomous Attack System (LOCAAS) and Miniature Air Launched Decoy (MALD) represent a new generation of small, low-cost weapon systems currently under development.  Deployment of these weapons from internal weapon bays of advanced tactical aircraft, such as the F-22, F-117A, and JSF poses new engineering challenges and drives the need to further the science of weapons carriage and release.  A change in the                                                            de safe separation of these new weapon systems from internal weapons bays.  Understanding and controlling how weapons will react to the flow within the weapons bay environment is essential in providing a high confidence of safe separation.  This proposal demonstrates a concept that will provide the desired result of improved safe separation.  Active Pitch Control utilizes real-time aircraft data to predict flow characteristics, particularly the turbulent shear layer.  Based on this prediction, the system reacts to provide an optimum pitch attitude to the weapon during ejection.  Alignment of the weapon with the shear layer will significantly minimize adverse aerodynamic moments and thus providing the weapon with significantly improved separation characteristics.",

Innovative testing approaches and well-equipped, affordable simulation and test facilities are required to analyze the effects of jamming/interference on GPS and to evaluate anti-jam techniques, such as adaptive antennas.  This capability is essential for developing ECCMs against jamming and devising effective ECMs against enemy GPS systems.The objectives of this research are twofold: (1) to upgrade the capabilities of the AFRL EW Anechoic Chamber (EWAC) infrastructure for conducting tests of GPS systems in realistic jamming environments, and (2) to perform the evaluation and analysis of GPS ECM/ECCM techniques.

Mainstream's solid-solid hybrid gas generator technology will result in the delivery of chemical extinguishing agents to the fire in addition to the inert gas agents. This technology has several advantages over state-of-the art gas generator fire suppression technology. First, the system will be significantly smaller and lighter than current gas generator systems because it results in chemical, in addition to physical, extinguishment of the fire. Second, the entire hybrid gas generator material is stored in a single storage vessel as a solid, compared to other hybrid systems which require a separate pressure storage vessel.

These materials must now be feasibility tested in complete product formulations.  There is also the potential for unexpected synergisms of these compounds with the other skin cream ingredients.  A considerable amount of money and time has already been spent analyzing intricate details of surface chemistry and reaction mechanisms for several proposed rTSP's, and yet there is still a demand for effective rTSP's as per this repested SBIR solicitation topic.  This may not be a coincidence. Our Tibbetts award-winning and commercial-minded approach is to efficiently use the SBIR funding to determine concept feasibility by product demonstration.  The university or part of a Phase II can delve into the chemistry details after the feasibility of the complete rTSP product is proven successful.  This Phase I will evaluate several reactive materials formulated into barrier cream formulations (e.g., perfluorinated polyether oil and PTFE thickeners) for reactivity and barrier capability toward several simulants, ingredient synergisms, potential skin irritation, cost, and approximate stoichiometry of products. Protective skin creams for personnel routinely exposed to toxic materials (e.g., toxic chemicals, nerve agents, plant related toxins such as poison ivy, pesticides, and herbicides) would benefit both commercial and military users. Examples are chemical warfare environments, police riot control, pesticide workers, and protection from poisonous plants and animals.",

MAK developed VR-Link, the world's most widely used DIS interface product, from an SBIR very similar to this one, awarded six years ago.  In that time VR-Link has enabled over 400 organizations worldwide to become DIS compliant, more than all other DIS development efforts combined and about 70% of the worldwide market. MAK has also invested considerable resources into VR-Link 3.0, the HLA version of VR-Link, which is about to be offered for commercial sale.  With this unparalleled track record, and immense head-start, MAK proposes the development of a suite of transition products for legacy Army systems, including a protocol converter hardware/software product based on VR-Link 3.0, VR-Link 3.0 itself, and a detailed         Transition Your Legacy System to HLA                                  n products would enable the transition of almost all of the Army's legacy simulations that they would reasonably care to upgrade to HLA compliance.  Early in Phase II, the products would be commercialized and sold on MAK's product list, leaving the remainder of the Phase II budget for performing several upgrades, and possibly developing a high-performance RTI for select Army programs which might require it (i.e. - JSIMS).  BENEFITS:  For Phase I, MAK will produce a prototype DIS to HLA translator which will be productized and commercially sold in Phase II.  The draft                                                         l be reviewed and completed in Phase II, and distributed freely to the DoD.  This firm foundation will permit several transitions to be accomplished in Phase II, as well as providing a vital set of commercial products which the Army can use to transition all of its candidate DIS systems to HLA.",

MSK Technologies has  substantial expertise in HLA, is the leading supplier of HLA tools, and is a  developer of networked games containing battlemaster components. Therefore, MSK is  the ideal candidate to develop the battlemaster required by the M&S community.  MSK Technologies will develop an HLA Battlemaster that supports configuration,  control, and monitoring of both federations and individual federates. The  Battlemaster will provide access to the required standard set of RTI's services,  the Management Object Model, and the federation's FOM. In addition, the Battlemaster  will provide a specialized set of services through its Battlemaster Application  Programmer Interface (BAPI), which supports federate-specific plug-ins. MSK's  Battlemaster will be based on MSK's commercial HLA Plan-View-Display, lowering time  requirements, cost, and risk, while providing additional capabilities that are not  ordinarily found in a battlemaster.  At the beginning of Phase I, MSK will interview operational users to determine the  functional requirements of the HLA Battlemaster. These requirements will guide  development of an object-orientated design specification. With the newly created  design and MSK's existing commercial PVD, MSK will create an initial Battlemaster  prototype. To complete the spiral development cycle, MSK proposes a Phase I option  to develop a test federation. We will iterate upon four components (requirements,  design, prototype, and test federation) during Phase II to create a powerful, robust,  flexible HLA Battlemaster. MSK can achieve all this in Phase I by leveraging existing  tools and technology, and by applying its experience in both HLA and design and  development of battlemasters for networked games.",

        "abstract": "HLA provides the opportunity to maximize the reuse, interoperability, and utility of modeling and simulation components.  However, it is up to simulation developers and tool manufacturers to create components that take advantage of these powerful HLA features.  MaK, the leading supplier of HLA tools, proposes to address this need with a suite of flexible tools that can be used by the Air Force in different simulation domains and in multi-level exercises.     MaK proposes the development of a set of HLA multi-federation tools that support multiple simulation domains, as well as multiple levels of simulation.  The tool suite will be built on a flexible VR-Link-based interface that provides network functionality, access to the RTI's services, and federation-specific utilities.  By leveraging existing COTS tools, applying their knowledge of HLA, and capitalizing on the commonality among the tools, MaK can provide a low-cost, low-risk solution that meets the functional and technical requirements.     MaK's flexible HLA interface will support multiple FOMs and provide access to federate-specific functionality.  MaK will work closely with both the MASC and the CUBE to ensure that the resulting interface meets federation-specific requirements, specifically those dealing with C2.  As a test case, the resulting design will be used to re-architect MaK's current HLA Stealth into an HLA multi-federation Stealth.  MaK is the ideal candidate to provide the Air Force with the next generation HLA tool suite because of their extensive knowledge of HLA, their ability to leverage existing commercial HLA Tools, and their direct experience developing multi-level simulation tools, such as a Stealth that can be used for both entity-level and aggregate-level visualization.",

Coatings have the potential to protect the die from molten metals if applied in an adherent, fault-free, smooth form in a composition containing corrosion resistance to the molten metal.  Coatings which are not wet or corroded by the reactive molten die casting metal can prevent soldering, erosion, oxidation, and heat checking while protecting a tool steel die.  A process called Plasma Assist Chemical Vapor Deposition or (PACVD) has been shown to uniformly coat complex geometries and such coatings demonstrate a greater degree of protection than other coatings.   In Phase I, experiments will be conducted to determine the boundary conditions for applying the PACVD process the coating of interest (TiN-TiCN-TiN).  Then, coating performance versus deposition parameters will be established.

Consequently, the environmentally benign, and inherently FR poly(ethylene terephthalate), PET, by incorporating nonhalogenated FR additives into PET's chemical structure, followed by crosslinking.  Two such additives have been investigated by Material Innovations, Inc. (MII) to develop a FR PET [1].   Although the initial studies were shown to be successful, more research is needed to determine the optimum quantity of each additive to provide the most efficient thermal insulation and compatibility with other technologies used in solder clothing.  In Phase II, Thermal Protective Performance, cone calorimetry, thermal conductivity, and moisture vapor permeability testing will be used to evaluate the performance of FR PET followed by producing prototype soldiers combat uniforms with an optimum configuration.",

        "abstract": "Cored fiberglass composites are currently being used as structural materials on several Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) programs.  They are also viable candidates for new designs for the LPD class and DD21 surface ship platforms.  The challenge imposed upon these material systems is that not only must they be superior monolithic metal counterparts in structure, they are additionally required to provide enhanced warfighting capability through greater environmental durability, superior radar cross-section (RCS) performance and adherence to MIL-STD-2301 and UL 1709 fire, smoke and toxicity (FST) specifications.  Syntactic core materials are well known for being lightweight, relatively strong, and extremely fire resistant.   Additional advantages of high dimensional stability, low water absorption and advantageous electrical properties warrant the application of these materials to topside composite designs.  This proposal details an approach, using the Integrated Product Team (IPT) philosophy to develop and integrate a multifunctional core material for use in Naval application.  This team will enable this program to not only develop a multifunctional core that meets the requirements of this solicitation, but provide the expertise and experience of previous lessons learned for integrating the resulting composite product into emerging Naval applications.",

This family of resin is low in cost, low in viscosity, chemically resistant, and possesses a cure cycle that ranges from room temperature for methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) peroxide to dicumyl peroxide for elevated cure vinylester .  As versitile as these family of resins are, they do suffer shortcomings. Vinylester resins exposed to fire insult exhibit severe structural degradation and off  gassing of toxic fumes.  Unfortunately, current fire protection schemes have resulted in very complicated, very costly, approaches for utilizing composite materials in Navy topside designs.  Innovative approaches are needed to advance the current state-of-the-art for vinylester- like resin systems to provide the Navy with a cost effective, certified material system with broad capability to emerging Naval applications.  The innovation prosented in this proposal is to develop a resin system utilizing proprietary formulation approached that will produce a fire retardant resin system, with vinylester characteristics, for a cost less than $10/lb.  This Phase I program will measure the neat resin mechanical, fire response and electrical characteristics, fabricate fiberglass composite panels using a VARTM (SCRIMP) process and measure the resulting mechanical, electric, and fire resistance characteristics of the composite panels.",

The high chemical reactivity of atomic oxygen flux has caused substantial degradation of materials on the Space Shuttle.  An atomic oxygen generator which can be used in ground-based laboratories is desperately needed.  Current techniques for forming atomic oxygen such as thermal dissociation, high-temperature electrical discharge, ion beams,laser breakdown, etc.  have some combination of the following problems:low flux density, cost, numerous excited states of oxygen and other gases.  In this proposed work, the combination of highly-oxygen permeable MIEC and thin Ag film is expected to generate very high flux of atomic oxygen.  The atomic oxygen flux generated is believed to be at least four order of magnitude greater than that using Ag membrane.   The use of highly oxygen-permeable MIEC also provides the possibility of directly using air as the source of oxygen.  This dual membrane also gives the opportunity of using higher oxygen or air pressure on the upstream side to further enhance the flux of atomic oxygen.  The simple concept and design of this proposed atomic oxygen generator will permit the design and construction of cost-effective, compact-sized, and high-flux atomic oxygen generator in Phase II.",

Aluminum oxy-nitride based optical materials are its ideal replacement, since it has a cubic symmetry, which results in isotropic properties and displays ~>80% in line transmission in the visible and near infrared regions (0.3um - 5.0um). Unfortunately, AlON suffers from compositional inhomogeneity due to incomplete reactive sintering, and unstable mechanical properties resulting from catastrophic grain growth owing to high sintering times (20-100 hours).

However, yield and reproducibility, particularly in large numbers and over large areas, remains problematic.  This project will improve the manufacturability of CIGS-based solar cells by developing co-sputtered CuInSe2 (CIS) absorber layers.  Co-sputtering should provide good control and scalability of the fluxes to the CIS layer, while maintaining essentially the same film growth and quality achieved in co-evaporated films.  Phase I will establish reliable film composition by monitoring each sputtering target with optical emission spectroscopy, evaluate the CIS film structure obtained from a two-stage co-sputtered process, determine the best method of Se delivery and control, control the sputter flux distributions, investigate ion bombardment effects in the growing film, and model a large-scale deposition system.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   The process should   lead to improvements in the manufacturability and therefore cost of CIS-based modules.

        "abstract": "Current and future aerospace systems require new cost-effective, high-temperature composite matrix resins without chemical functional groups that are susceptible to hydrolysis (e.g., imides).  Maxdem has developed novel rigid-rod polyparaphenylenes, designated Poly-X(TM) resins, with unique combinations of processability, mechanical strength and stiffness, hardness, toughness, moisture and chemical resistance, thermal stability, and competitive cost.  High compressive strength thermoplastic composites have been fabricated with Poly-X(TM) matrix resins, but softening temperatures are too low for many aerospace applications.  However, preliminary results suggest that related thermoset polyarylene formulations can be made that show little or no moisture uptake, contain no hydrolyzable chemical moieties, and have high softening temperatures after cure.  During the proposed Phase I effort, initial thermosetting polyarylene compositions will be prepared and demonstrated to be useful as matrix resins for high-temperature structural composites.  Key Phase I objectives include verification of the high-temperature utility, hygrothermal stability, and practical processability and curing chemistry of the proposed polyarylene formulations.  If successful, the results will support additional resin optimization studies and fabrication of the most promising candidate resins into prepregs and composite test coupons for more detailed mechanical and thermal evaluation during Phase II efforts.",

        "abstract": "We propose to develop a new class of proton exchange membranes (PEM) based on polyphenylene polymers. These new PEM's are designed to overcome fuel crossover problems encountered with conventional sulfonated fluoropolymers. Recently, Maxdem has conducted preliminary studies of polyphenylene PEM's and demonstrated the outstanding properties of these materials for proton conductivity. The proton conductivities of some of these polymer materials are much higher than Dupont's Nafionr membranes, even at high temperature (>100\u00bfC). Films with methanol absorption comparable to the commercial products showed better performance in operating direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC). A new approach is proposed in this proposal to minimize the solvent crossover while maintaining high proton conductivity. Further investigation based on the preliminary results is expected to provide PEM's for practical fuel cell applications with unmatched performance and at lower costs than current commercial products. The new PEM's with optimized properties are expected to find immediate applications in both hydrogen and direct methanol fuel cells.  BENEFITS:  The novel proposed electrolytes would allow major advances in small, light and more efficient fuel cells by providing high conductivity and low fuel crossover. Light weight, high energy density fuel cells are needed for powering electric vehicles and for manportable applications. Both defense (future soldier systems), and civilian (electric cars) applications present large potential markets.",

Natural attenuation or the stimulation of halorespiring microorganisms are potentially the most promising and cost-effective technologies for remediating sites contaminated with chlorinated compounds.  Central to the successful implementation of these bioremediation technologies is the determination of the presence of halorespiring organisms at the site and of the extent of dechlorination.  Halo-respiration is an energy-producing metabolic process and is characterized by (i) high dechlorination rates. (ii) fe values in the range of 0.6-0.7, (iii) hydrogen threshold values below 0.5ppmv.  This process is carried out by several diverse groups of bacteria and stimulated by different substrates.  Hence, measures of the process , and not of organisms or genera, are currently the only approaches that reliably measure halorespiration.  Our primary approach, therefore, is to determine these parameters to establish the presence and activity of halorespriring organisms.  These measurements can be performed in microcosms containing solids, and a time consuming enrichment procedure for halorespiring organisms is not required.  The research is aimed towards the development of a protocol with general applicability for the evaluation of sediment and aquifer materials for the presence of halorespiring organisms.  In addition to the evaluation for the intrinsic bioremediation potential of a certain site, this protocol will also provide valuable information about possible biostimulation strategies.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of an innovative design that combines centrifugal separation, cross-flow filtration (CFF), Dean flow surface cleaning and back-flush techniques into an effective micro-filtration unit. The centrifugal separation is effective in separating particles that have higher specific gravity that the feed fluid down to 20 microns.  CFF is especially effective for feed flow with a high amount of colloidal solids.  Unlike dead-end filtration, the surface dynamics of CFF does not make the gelatinous colloidal solids extrude through pores which often comprise the performance of filtration.  CFF makes use of the shear force parallel to the filter medium to reduce the cake formation on the filter surface.  Dean flow is a secondary flow created in a curved flow passage.  The resulting flow profile takes the form of a toroidal vortex.  The vortex profile generates a high shear rate which acts to transport material such as colloidal solids and fine silts away from the membrane surface.  The combination of these features with an automatic back-flushing device forms a compact, self-cleaning and continuously operable unit suitable for pre-filtration in the Navy shipboard reverse osmosis application.",

Currently, air stripping followed by carbon adsorption is the preferred treatment method.  However, this technique is expensive and produces large secondary waste streams.  Pervaporation is a potential cost effective method of treating water contaminated with volatile RCRA organics; however, most groundwater contains dissolved iron, and scaling from precipitated iron fouls the membrane.  This project will develop new process designs and module cleaning procedures to allow pervaporation to be applied to these streams.

The new micromachining techniques allow materials other than silicon to have sub-millimeter structures imprinted onto them.  For example, metals such as copper, steel, and aluminum can have microchannels cut into their surfaces to produce a microchannel heat exchanger.  These microchannel heat exchangers have exhibited heat transfer in excess of 100 watts per square centimeter.

The P&CS permits remote control of the RPV mission, monitoring of the GPS location of the RPV,display  of real-time radar data to ensure data quality, and permits use of high-capacity commercial recording devices that would otherwise be too heavy and too power-hungry for use aboard the vehicle carrying the radar.",

The airborne system features jitter control to less than 10 microradians while performing line of sight stabilized tracking from aircraft. Two MetroLaser gimbals now in service are delivering 3-5 microradian performance. The high bandwidth control system completely compensates for roll, pitch, and yaw of the moving vehicle.  Much of the technology is directly applicable to the shipboard problem.   The control system will always maintain lock-on of operator designated targets using edge, correlation, or centroid tracking after handover from the ship's radar.  Sea State 3 is within the gimbals' performance envelope.  The combination of MetroLaser's rigid structures and the Hughes patented quasi-strapdown equation solution results in a gimbal of exceptional stability and performance.   Either a mirror or a sensor package mounted directly on the gimbal can be adapted to meet the Navy requirement.  We will assess critical issues such as materials, field-of-regard, protective coatings and candidate mounting locations.  Phase I culminates in a recommended configuration and design analysis for a prototype gimbal.",

As optical diagnostics become more sophisticated, the requirements on optical access become more demanding.  Flat windows and their mountings on curved cell walls can adversely affect the flows in these tunnels,  not only affecting the test conditions themselves but also complicating optical diagnostics.  Problems include aberrations, losses, multiple reflections, window contamination, effects on the flow and boundary layer,  and many others.   Solutions to these problems vary widely.  Conformal opticals can reduce effects on the flow, but curved optics introduce new problems such as high cost and aberrations.   This proposal offers a generalized approach to the selection and production of conformal optical elements.   The approach will be applicable to a wide variety of requirements imposed by different diagnostic techniques.   An optics code will be selected and adapted for this application to provide specifications for the window optical characteristics which can be assessed imediately.

        "abstract": "We propose to develop a new type of microfabricated sensor capable of measuring time-resolved shear stress inside turbulent boundary layers. Unlike existing micro-mechanical designs, the proposed sensor uses optical rather than electrical addressing.  Optical addressing results in four important improvements:  1)  More robust and rugged micro-mechanical sensors can be constructed by taking advantage of the high sensitivity of optical interferometry for the detection of small displacements,  2)optical addressing allows mutiple sensors to be placed on a single device, mitigating the effects of single sensor failure,  3)  for research purposes,multiple sensors can easily be deployed over a test surface and suquentially addressed from outside the model,   eliminating the need for electrical access behind the model,   and 4)  real-time full field analysis of shear stress will become possible by simultaneously addressing multiple sensors.  The microfabricated sensor will be suitable for economical mass production and can be incorporated into both research and flight situations.",

        "abstract": "Current fire-retardant/fire-resistant resin materials for   composite panel systems in Naval topside applications do not   provide the required levels of fire protection and combustion   resistance.  The need exists for a lightweight, fire-resistant   resin systems that enables composite structures to maintain   structural integrity following exposure to high intensity flames   (without toxic releases), thereby affording fire-barrier   protection to equipment and personnel.  Development of such a   system would extend the use of composite structures far beyond   current levels.  Previous attempts to improve fire resistance in   resin systems have focused on improving resin chemistry and/or   incorporation of certain fire-retardant additives.  However, the   effectiveness of additives has inevitably been limited by the need   to balance their enhanced fire-resistance with their adverse   effect on mechanical properties and processability.  Under the   proposed program, METSS will investigate incorporating recent   advanced in nano-phase materials processing into intumescent   additives fir a series if resin systems.  Nano-pahse additives,   which possess increase in specific surface area orders of   magnitude high than conventional additives, offer the potential to   minimize additive weight and volume, thereby enhancing combustion   resistance significantly beyond current levels without adverse   effect on mechanical properties or signal selectivity.  METSS is   uniquely qualified to develop the resin system, possessing the   necessary expertise in processing, testing and evaluation of   composite materials and expertise and practical experience in   formulations of fire-retardant additives and resins.",

The existing TSPs provide an effective physical barrier to CWAs. However, they possess no destructive capacity toward the CWAs. The incorporation of catalytically reactive materials capable of neutralizing chemical warfare agents, nerve agents and/or vesicants, would markedly enhance the efficacy of TSPs. Under the proposed program METSS will identiiy and synthesize catalytically reactive materials (emryrnes) capable of neutralizing CWAs. The destruction of both organophosphorous compounds and vesicants will be considered. The materials developed by METSS will be incorporated into the existing barrier cream formulation, and the feasibility of the proposed concept will be demonstrated by measuring the destruction efficiency of the catalytic agents for suitable organophosphorous simulants of CWAs, such as Malathion or Parathion. A secondary objective of the program is to use computational models to demonstrate the feasibility of designing small molecular catalysts that will model enzyme activity for the production of artificial chemzymes which can be used to catalyze the destruction of CWAs. The incorporation of a catalytically reactive species that will inactivate CWAs will markedly increase and enhance the efficacy of TSPs by increasing the barrier properties of the protectant. The action of the materials on the CWAs will remove their toxic properties should breakthrough occur.

Material quality, structure, stoichiometry, and impurity content all affect its microwave resistivity and can be detected the probe.  Our main objective in this study is to design and develop a prototype probe that can be used in actual deposition chambers to monitor film growth in-situ and in real-time.  Such a probe will be invaluable in providing a feedback on the growth conditions to control of the process.  Our preliminary studies indicate that the evanescent microwave probe is capable of performing such a task.  Furthermore, we will investigate possibility of using multi-frequency probes as a method to investigate hierarchy of properties encountered in multi-layered structures.  Depth variation as well as information regarding the gradient of properties will be obtained and monitored to control the deposition process.

Often this data is being presented through the pilot's visual field via heads-up displays and helmet mounted displays.  Modern training simulators must be capable of accurately duplicating this environment through high fidelity imagery with multiple interactive display entities.  This requires cost effective HMD technology capable of very high resolution, high brightness and good color quality.Microvision, Inc. proposes to develop such a display system by increasing resolution of their Virtual Retinal Display (VRD) technology.  The VRD operates by rapidly scanning an image directly onto the retina of the eye with a pinpoint focused beam of light.  This technology is in the prototype stage, and has strong potential for performance increase and commercialization.  Several methods have been identified to increase resolution, including optical scan line doubling, interlacing, and use of multiple light sources.  Microvision proposes to investigate these techniques and develop system specifications in Phase 1, and commercialize the technology through Phase 2 and 3.  Microvision's experience with scanning image technology and exclusive ownership of VRD technology assures rapid commercialization.",

Input from a tactile actuator array could accomplish this goal by giving a physical interrupt to the pilot.  Piezoceramics appear to be the most promising actuator material for the tactile actuator arrays.  Lead Zirconate Titanat (PXT) is a commercially available piezoceramic material that has a long history of use as an actuator.  PZTs have a high energy output per unit mass and volume and draw little power at low frequencies.  The amplitude of PZTs can be smoothly varied and they can produce non-sinusoidal inputs.  PZTs have already been shown to survive and operate in the harsh environment of space.  Since the piezoelectric effect is due to a change in the applied electric field, PZT actuators do not produce magnetic fields.  The Phase I effort will examine various actuator technologies and develop initial prototype designs.  Phase II will refine these designs and then build and test prototypes of two candidate designs.",

        "abstract": "Several important emerging applications require efficient, high-speed high-duty-cycle, amplitude modulation of high levels of microwave power, with low cost and small size-and-weight.  The modulation frequency and average power required for these applications are far beyond the capabilities of existing technology.  MRC proposes to research and develop two alternative methods of achieving square-wave modulation at rates as high as MHz and beyond.  One proposed method uses innovative variations of RF pulse-compression techniques demonstrated by the linear accelerator community to achieve such modulation at efficiencies in the vicinity of 90%.  This approach uses a CW microwave source and RF cavities to chop up, delay, and stack pulses, resulting in peak output power much higher than that of the source (e.g., about triple for 33% duty cycle operation).  The other approach, aimed primarily at extremely-efficient crossed-field microwave devices (CFDs), achieves modulation efficiencies above 96% using relatively low-cost pulsed-power components, by essentially reducing the problem to modulation of the tube's dynamic impedance alone.  MRC will be assisted in this endeavor by Litton Systems, Inc., which is sufficiently interested in the potential of this project to provide support during Phase I free of charge.  In addition to the requirement for this technology in the DoD HPM community, there is substantial need for highly -efficient, low-cost, high-speed AM modulation of high microwave power in applications such as radar, especially airborne radar.  AM modulation currently involves more expensive modulators or very inefficient linear microwave amplifiers that draw considerable power during the off cycle.",

        "abstract": "The use of composite materials on the topsides of Navy ships is rapidly increasing sue to efforts to lower and control the ship's Radar Cross Sections (RCS) signature and improve the war-fighting capabilities of the fleet.  The introduction of large composite structures greatly increases the threat of lightning induced damage; thus, mitigation of the lightning threat is a necessary requirement.  Traditional lightning protection measures for large structures (e.g., facilities, hangers, launch pads, and so forth) have large scattering cross sections and are not suitable for RCS conscious ship designs.  Low observable lightning protection systems can be found on aircraft, but the costs of these mitigation techniques are undesirable for large ship applications.  Hence, a low cost and low RCS lightning protection approach needs to be developed for the topsides of ships.   This proposal outlines a program that will quantify the lighting protection requirement of ship topsides, investigate state-of-the-art and innovative lightning protection techniques, and develop detailed evaluation and validation criteria for lightning protection systems.",

Produced as a monolithic GAL/LNA and incorporated into radar and communication equipment front-ends, it will provide protection from damage and disruption by electromagnetic radiation and ESD.  Phase-1 consists of four tasks: 1) design and fabrication of GAL prototypes, 2) testing of GAL prototypes, 3) design and performance modeling of the monolithic GAL/LNA for Phase-2, and 4) final report.  First, prototype GAL units using power PHEMTs are designed and constructed using discrete components which are bond-wired together.  Next, the GAL units are tested to assess their a) power-protection capability as a function of gate periphery and rf pulse width, b) adjustability characteristics (turn-on adjustment level and time required to vary this level), and c) operational lifetime.  The noise parameters for the power PHEMTs used will be obtained.  The test results will be used to design and model monolithic GAL/LNA units for fabrication and demonstration in Phase-2 and provide performance predictions for the monolithic GAL/LNA.  The final report will document all work performed and provide a schedule and work plan to build and demonstrate a family of monolithic GAL/LNA units for use as commercial products.  BENEFITS:  A monolithic limiter/LNA with an adjustable turn-on threshold such as GAL provides cost effective, small size, and robust RF-protection capability.  It meets the growing military need for radar and communication system RF protection and similar commercial needs to mitigate disrupting RF interference in the exploding wireless technology market.

The initiators for PCLs have been principally electron beams and flashlamps.  The electrical components for these initiators are large, heavy and fragile and therefore PCLs have not been fieldable as transportable systems.  The solution to the problem of making a compact PCL is to replace flashlamps and electron-beam initiators with a rugged, highly efficient, initiator technology.  The opportunity exists to use recent advances in surface-discharge initiators to make a compact, portable and rugged PCL.

If scaled versions of existing klystrons were used to drive such an accelerator, almost 10,000 individual tubes would be required at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars.  However, these klystrons also would not be suitable for operation at the even higher frequencies envisioned for future generations of accelerators.  This project will develop a new microwave source, the Triaxial Klystron Amplifier, that uses a large-diameter annular electron beam propagating between two coaxial structures.  The Triaxial Klyston promises to be capable of an order of magnitude higher power and much higher frequency than scaled klystrons, while simultaneously achieving the high efficiency, phase stability, reliability, and repetitive operation required.  This would greatly reduce the cost of future colliders and potentially provide the key to the economic viability of such accelerators.  During Phase I, the overall cavity structure will be designed to maximize microwave power, and computer simulations of the beam interaction with the structure will be performed.  The feasibility of the Triaxial Klystron will be determined  by analyzing key engineering issues, such as repetitive electron beam generation and output coupling of the microwave power.  The project will also investigate the potential scaling of the device to even higher frequencies as well as a novel, compact accelerator based on the Triaxial Klystron.  The results of these analyses will be used to design an overall system that can be fabricated and tested during Phase II.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   The proposed work will demonstrate unequivocally the ability of the Triaxial Klystron Amplifier to satisfy the stringent conditions placed upon advanced linear accelerator drivers.  The commercial market for this single application is huge.  Other potential civilian applications include chemical processing, materials studies, bulk heating, surface processing, and plasma heating.  The source can also play a major role in various military applications, such as electronic warfare and various nonlethal munitions._",

The purpose of this sensor integration is to supply the Air Force with environmental sensors which meet Air Force environmental needs with statistically significant data.  We propose integration of commercially available sensors that provide legally-defensible data with regulatory verification.  Phase I will involve the integration of one of the sensors discussed in this proposal with laboratory testing using the E-SMART system.

COTS memory devices hold significant density advantages over radiation hardened memory devices. However, the space environment, especially high energy ions, make the implementation of COTS hardware difficult and this will continue to worsen as COTS memory densities continue to increase. Our Phase I proposal makes use of the COTS memory devices and commercial processes to enable the use of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) in space computers.  To accomplish this we propose a two-pronged effort: the development of a COTS radiation tolerant memory module and the concept of a radiation hardened DRAM device for a commercial foundry.

However, neither the HLA or current simulation environments provide the high level coordination capability needed for the activities involved in creating and managing complex, synthetic, battlespace environments.

In Phase I, Modus Operandi will integrate VISGEEN with existing M&S assets and use them to create a scenario for execution.  VISGEEN will then initialize, manage, and visualize the scenario executing within the context of the HLA.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   \nThe overall objective of the proposed Competing Continuation is to develop and incorporate into the MiTiHeart LVAD those elements necessary to meet the requirements for FDA IDE application. In support of this goal and based on initial FDA communications, it has been determined that the addition of a validated electronic controller and power supply system to the MiTiHeart LVAD along with additional in vitro and in vivo testing are needed to support the IDE application. The MiTiHeart LVAD, which has been developed under previous SBIR Grants and company funds, is a small non-thrombogenic rotary pump with magnetic levitation and a redundant hydrodynamic thrust bearing system. The current design specifies that all blood-contacting surfaces be manufactured from TI-6AI-4V alloy and coated with an innovative fully hydrogenated diamond like carbon (DLC) coating. A heparinized organic film overcoat is applied to all rotating DLC coated blood-contacting surfaces. The combination of hydrophobic DLC coating and hydrophilic organic coating provides an innovative means to reduce the shear stresses and minimize platelet activation, thereby reducing the potential for hemolysis and thrombosis. The proposed performance tests include in vitro hemolysis tests, in vivo bovine calf animal testing, and in vitro long-term durability tests. All LVAD components will be inspected following each test for indications of thrombus formation or coating degradation and will be modified if necessary before embarking on the next test. The following Specific Aims are planned for the proposed SBIR Competing Continuation program: (1) Develop the controller and power supply system for the MiTiHeart LVAD, (2) Manufacture blood pumps for performance evaluations, (3) Conduct in vitro hemolysis testing, (4) Conduct in vivo animal testing using a bovine calf model, and (5) Perform in vitro performance and durability testing. As a result of this program a reliable and thoroughly characterized LVAD with percutaneous controller and power supply system will be readied for additional preclinical testing required prior to submission of the IDE application. In the commercialization efforts of Phase II, the technology developed under this study will be transferred to MiTiHeart Corporation, a subsidiary MiTi, established to manufacture and market unique blood pumps for use as destination therapy for adult heart failure patients of small to medium frame that are not being served by present pulsatile devices.",

        "abstract": "The development of obscurant materials has become increasingly important for the prevention of detection in the battlefield.  An obscurant is a material that modifies the spectral signatures over a wide wavelength range and renders detection based on specific spectral signatures difficult.  While the obscurant materials currently available have multi-spectral capability, there is a need to develop obscurants that are biodegradable and nonpersistent to overcome problems associated with environmental toxicity.  The objective of this Phase I proposal is to develop biodegradable obscurant materials that possess the same or surpass the multi-spectral capabilities of the current materials. Further, the materials should be produced in an environmentally benign production process.  Materials based on composites of doped polyaniline/polyanion complex and the biodegradable polymer chitosan will be developed.  The doped polyanilines will be synthesized in an aqueous medium using enzymatic polymerization of aniline in the presence of a polydopant, namely, poly (vinylphosphonic acid), under close to neutral PH condition. The soluble polycomplex will be precipitated by the addition of polycationic biodegradable chitosan and processed into films and fibers.  The multi-spectral capabilities of the composites will be determined.  BENEFITS:  The water soluble conducting polyaniline that will be synthesized can be used as a multi-spectral obscurant and will find application in the electronic battlefield by preventing detection by enemy sensors. A biodegradable polymer base makes the multi-spectral obscurant environmentally nontoxic and nonpersistent.",

The proposed algorithm will solve Maxwell's equations in the combined surface/volumetric integral form in the frequency domain.

The underlying algorithm formulation will employ discretization and matrix compression techniques assuring accurate modeling of inhomogeneous, irregularly shaped dispersive media, and a significant reduction of memory and execution time requirements with respect to conventional method of moments and partial differential equation solvers.

DeVito, Principal Investigator\nMr. James R. Domnanovich, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG02-98ER82623\nAmount:  $75,000\n\n\nCurrent Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography instrumentation for research laboratory imaging of small animals has consisted primarily of a few custom-made devices or has relied on the use of conventional gamma cameras designed for the morphology of human patients.  However, conventional SPECT has relatively poor performance for small object imaging because of the unfavorable geometry of conventional gamma cameras.  As a result, researchers are limited in the imaging tools that they can apply to biological research and drug development.  This project aims to develop a novel high-resolution SPECT device suitable for small animal imaging.  This device will use an innovative configuration adapted to the imaging needs of small objects.  A thorough evaluation of design constraints necessary to achieve high resolution will be conducted.  A prototype will be developed to demonstrate the technology.  The primary objectives of Phase I are to determine the sampling geometry required for high resolution and to understand the practical measurement limitations set by real devices.  This understanding will be used to define the configuration and the target specifications for a product prototype.  In Phase II a prototype based on the specifications generated in Phase I will be constructed and tested.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   This high-resolution SPECT product should provide a valuable tool for biological research and drug development laboratories as well as to veterinary clinics.  Currently no acceptable imaging device meets the needs for these specialized markets.   Further development will extend the technology to human clinical imaging applications._",

In Phase I we will: 1) choose the best monolithic approach that allows the growth of high quality LWIR HgCdTe and avoids degradation of the readout, 2) Provide a preliminary readout design for an LWIR HgCdTe p-on-n 1280 x 960 monolithic array which has a 25um x 25um or smaller pitch, high optical fill factor, and can accommodate a high background charge, 3) Grow HgCdTe heterostructures on silicon and test the resulting p on n detectors, and 4) develop the processing steps for fabricating the selected monolithic IRFPA and assign the risk to each of those processing steps.  Metal refractory in place of aluminum will be considered as an intermediate metallization for the readouts until the higher post silicon processing temperatures required for buffer layer growth for the HgCdTe can be reduced.  Both (100) and (211) silicon are considered for HgCdTe growth.

Cost is the primary consideration in the commercial market. Therefore, manufacturing processes are needed to fabricate components from advanced materials that are affordable and competitive on a cost basis with current materials. MS Technology (MST) proposes to combine defense technologies to manufacture advanced ceramic matrix composites at affordable costs.  A new laminar ceramic matrix composite (CMC) of a ceria-zirconia matrix reinforced with layers of CeO2-ZrO2 and Al203 ceramics has been developed by defense industries. These layered composites have the potential for fracture toughness as high as some tool steels, up to 40 MPa-m1/2. Currently, this new CMC cannot be made into practical and inexpensive, commercial components. In view of this, MST has started its own project to develop a desktop manufacturing system for structural monolithic ceramics using a laminated object manufacturing (LOM) technique. The LOM technique is uniquely suited to manufacture layered CMCs.  The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of manufacturing layered CMCs using the LOM technique. Another objective will be to develop the equipment and processes so that layered composites can be manufactured for ballistic missile defense or other commercial applications at reasonable costs.",

        "abstract": "Common Databases compatibility across multiple IG platforms is an exceeding difficult task.  Historically, every image generator used its own database format, and modeling tools were proprietary and exclusive to the image generator they supported.  Compounding the problem is the fact that it is not simply one database that must be shared across different IG platforms, but rather the multiple databases (such as SAF, IR and Visual) required for each simulation that must be perfectly correlated with one another and across multiple IG platforms.  MGI's goal for this SBIR is to develop a process that is as automated as possible, supported by a GUI, for the conversion of existing databases through the use of our expertise in the data exchange environment.  MGI would develop a framework (either with SEDRIS or other common formats to achieve this goal).  MGI proposes to commercialize the GUI and the process by including the capability in our COTS CreatorPro option package tilted InteroperabilityPro.  MultiGen modeling tools are used as core modeling tools by all major image generator manufacturers.  By incorporating the conversion process and GUI into Creator, the tools immediately will have nearly universal availability to the simulation community in a COTS environment.",

Existing sensors (radar, seismis, acoustic, IR) offer limited performance, particularly in missions requiring broad area surveillance.  Surveillance through walls and doors may also be desired to assist special operations forces in monitoring activity when visual means are not available.  The use of ultra wideband (UWB) radar offers excellent penetration capability without the loss of resolution. Multispectral Solutions, Inc. (MSSI) has developed a very low cost radar technology that can be easily modified to perform surveillance functions.  The sensor will operate as a time-gated presence sensor and only objects within a selected range will be detected.  These detections will be based upon returned energy levels and not doppler motion.  This feature when combined with a low cost CMOS camera output, will substantially reduce nuisance and false alarms.  Since UWB waveforms are difficult to detect, the sensors can be used in situations where covertness is required. Under Phase I, MSSI proposes to develop a prototype UWB surveillance sensor for field test and evaluation.  Under Phase II, several prototypes will be constructed for use by USSOCOM.",

The metrology requirements for membrane mirrors are unique.  The initial mirror figure and radius of curvature have large departures from the final required shape and for multi-meter size the errors may consist of thousands of waves of higher order spherical aberration.  These large errors must be measured so that an actuation system can be used to reduce the error to within at least tens of waves of the desired surface.

The denial of GPS to enemies during conflicts without denying GPS to friendly forces is required to assure dominance.  The most effective method of protecting GPS from jamming is through providing  a high power GPS signal; e.g. from a geostationary augmentation.  Similarly, the most effective of denying GPS C/A code is through jamming the GPS signal with a high poer broadband noise or CW source at Ll (1575.42 MHz).  However, the power required to continuously transmit a jamming signal over an interdicted area limits the application of long duration high altitude UAVs or space-based resources as jammer platforms.In this proposal, a low power method of selective denial is proposed that is suitable for use by space systems or high altitude UAV platforms.  Under this effort, NAVSYS proposes to develop a preliminary space system architecture and design for a GPS augmentation system to provide both protection and selective denial from space.",

The first will be an outgrowth of nanoparticle metal oxides as destructive adsorbents, where catalytic action is facilitated by placing monolayers of catalytically active transition metal oxides on nanoparticles of MgO and/or ZnO.  Another approach to generating catalytic behavior will be to incorporate into the skin cream tertiary amine functionalities so that when the nanoparticles cause base catalyzed dehydrohalogenation of half mustard, mustard gas, or nerve agents, the liberated HCl or HF will be neutralized.  The second technology approach will be through subcontracted collaborative work with Professor Craig Hill of Emory University, where polyoxometalates (POMs) will be employed as oxidation catalysts for half-mustard and other warfare mimics.  The key steps to be investigated will be POM facilitated oxidation of the sulfur atom to the less toxic sulfoxide, and subsequent removal of the sulfoxide into the skin cream so that catalytic sites are liberated for further action.  Finally, these two emerging technologies, nanoparticle metal oxides and polyoxometalates will be combined to harness both their catalytic potentials.  For example, certain polyoxometalates will be coated onto ZnO nanoparticles.  Specific uses of Catalytic Reactive Nanoparticles include:  (1) protective skin cream; (2) Personnel protective equipment; (3) biological and chemical warfare decontamination systems; and (4) emergency decontamination kits.",

Futrure generations of portable devices require smaller and faster MCMs to meet customer demands. However, the problem of crosstalk between metalization lines develops when the size of the MCM is decreased. This can be minimized by reducing the dielecric constant of the dielecric layers in the MCM substrate. The best way to reduce the  dieelctric constant is by adding holllow microspheres which add controlled porosity to dielectric layers of the MCM. Nanochem has a process which can supply alumina microspheres with sizes ranging from 1 to 3 microns and have dense thin-walled shells which are impermeable to water and oil absorption. Optimum conditions will be determined to formt he hollow microspheres. These optimum microspheres will be tested in MCM devices and tested for dielectric properties.",

This program seeks to focus on demonstrating a multi-sensor technology that can reliably, rapidly, and safely detect unexploded mines in presence of natural and man made clutter. During Phase I, NRC will demonstrate the proof-of-concept Phase II will optimize, build prototypes, and field test the technology. Phase III will commercialize the technology.

        "abstract": "Separation of trace quantities of species from gas and liquid streams is a major problem for both defense and commercial applications.  The motivation for removal varies greatly in different applications.  Examples include; safety (gas masks and protective clothing in chemical warfare and hazardous industrial environments), higher semiconductor yields (particularly for deep UV lithography), drinking water clean-up (such as lead), and production of UHP chemicals for electronics.  Separations for these and other applications are growing rapidly as a result of increasing environmental, safety and energy regulation as well as the increased risk of chemical warfare by terrorist organizations.  For the separation of species from dilute streams, the most preferred method is adsorption.  Activated carbons are the preferred adsorbent because of their very high surface area and low costs.  However, it is difficult to change surface chemistry of carbons to achieve enhanced selectivity, greater adsorbent capacity, greater retention and possible catalytic decomposition toxic compounds.  This project explores the use of novel surface modification schemes using chemical weapons simulants and ammonia/amines as sample toxic gases/vapor.  The improvement in absorber performance as a function of surface modification, base activated carbon, and water content will be demonstrated.",

Beetz, Principal Investigator\nMr. Robert Boerstler, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG02-98ER82625\nAmount:  $75,000\n\n\nExisting vacuum photocathodes have limited quantum efficiencies in the visible spectrum and limited wavelength response in the near infrared.  The intrinsic photoemission mechanism extends to nearly 3\u00bfm radiation, but the low optical absorption of the photocathode material,  when balanced against the short photoelectron escape depth, prevents high effective quantum efficiency.  The effective quantum efficiency can be improved by forming vacuum photocathodes on a substrate which is shaped in such a way that the effective optical thickness to incident photons is large, but the effective escape depth for electrons remains small.  This will be accomplished by forming a silicon/silica micromachined channel surface with very high aspect ratio channels on which the photocathode is formed; then the photoelectrons will be emitted into the channels, but the photons will continue to cross more thicknesses of photocathode.\n\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Vacuum photocathodes with quantum efficiencies approaching 50 % between 350 nm - 2.5\u00bfm should result.  This should greatly improve low light level detectors and imagers, resulting in more sensitive spectrometers, night vision devices, medical diagnostic imagers and equipment, including DNA analysis, and fiber optic communications._",

At present YBCO films on metal tapes are limited in superconducting quality largely due to unsatisfactory crystal structural quality caused by imperfections in the metal surface and buffer-film crystallinestructure and surfaces.  Buffers of yttria-stabilized zirconia in combination with ceria have been successfully used by this P.I. in a collaboration with the subcontractor to demonstrate good-quality YBCO films on their biaxially-oriented nickel tape.  The proposed program will leverage this skill of the principals and the considerable commercial advantages of an independent route to substrate fabrication and teaming with a major manufacturer of superconducting wire and devices.  The program will utilize improved technology for very large-area pulsed-laser deposition (PLD) of films and novel ion-beam methods for surface smoothing prior to film deposition.  New buffer-film materials and multilayer combinations will be explored, including certain possibilities for fabricating conducting buffers that would have considerable advantage in the targeted applications area.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this Phase I proposal is to verify the feasibility fro use of a robotic laser fabrication and repair system and to show how this innovative technology application will reduce costs of Warfighter systems and components, and improve performance and reliability. This system will provide impact in the shipyard, on the factory floor, in the aircraft repair depot and onboard ship. The number of potential military applications for this technology is very large, and provides the potential for significant savings of resources and time in production of military hardware, fabrication of defense relate components, and erpair and maintenance of esisting systems. Based on the integration of existing techologies into an innovative new computer-based process modeling and planning environment, this development will provide a demonstration of the apllications in Phase I. It can be applie dto large-scale or few-of-a-kind manufacturing, or fast production of long procurement lead-time parts, for the rapid prototyping of components that have real evaluatable and testable form & fit capability, and for repair and maintenance thru reforming of damagd & distorted parts. The system that will be developed is generally based on COTS hardware; and both the hardware and software is reconfigurable; The operator environments are intuitive, interactive and graphical. It will use a relatively low-cost PC computer-based 3D-CAD technology from Intergraph Corporation that is fully compatible with the Integrated Ship Design System currently under development for the Navy by Intergraph.",

Under this grant, Navatek conceptualized a high-speed ship buoyantly and dynamically supported by high lift-to drag, high operating Froude number (F>1.2) lifting bodies operating in the presence of the free surface.  This concept emerged from Navatek's research on SLICE and MIDFOIL technology, including large demonstrators.  The four methods are 1) boundary layer ingestion to recover the momentum in the boundary layer; 2) base blowing to reduce the surface area of the submerged hull after bodies, eliminate control surface appendages and alter the pressure distribution over the body; 3) base venting to reduce the surface area of the strut afterbodies; 4) high lift-to-drag deltoid lifting body strut appendages to create a solitary wave to unwet strut appendages.  Numerical analysis using validated CFD programs will develop concepts to achieve the highest lift-to-drag performance.  The resultant designs can be tested at large model scale using Navatek-owned test craft, including the SLICE and MIDFOIL craft.",

These strains are incapable of utilizing sucrose as carbon source, therefore, the use of inexpensive raw materials, e.g. molasses, in the fermentation process is not possible.  Our goal is to develop a generally applicable model system of E. coli K-12 strains, which expresses recombinant proteins to high levels and is able to grow in media containing sucrose as the main carbon source.  The use of sucrose-fermenting E. coli K-12 could substantially reduce the cost of recombinant protein production.  In Phase I of the project we will construct and characterize a number of sucrose-fermenting strains, and test production of a model recombinant protein, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase.  Finally, we will integrate our findings in a genetic-metabolic model, with primary emphasis on defining the optimal genetic arrangement for high-level target protein production.

        "abstract": "Nielsen Engineering & Research (NEAR) is proposing to investigate the feasibility of two innovative solid-state concepts for MEMS-based turbulent wall shear-stress transducers.  The first design, which relies on the variation in acoustic convection velocity through the boundary layer, employs established MEMS transducers.  The second concept, which directly measures the shear force on the wall, is produced using an emerging MEMS fabrication technique.  Neither of the proposed designs incorporate any moving parts or are sensitive to airborne contaminants such as dust and rain.  During the Phase I program, NEAR will determine the feasibility of each of the proposed designs in terms of their environmental robustness, manufacturability, frequency response, and accuracy.  Both theoretical analysis and wind tunnel experimentation will be used to investigate the influence of design parameters and flow conditions.  Relatively large scale (non-MEMS) prototypes will be used during the wind tunnel tests to evaluate feasibility.  During the Phase II effort, NEAR will use the Phase I results to refine the system design and will fabricate operational transducers using MEMS production techniques.  An evaluation study will be conducted to assess the design's ability to handle harsh operating conditions and to evaluate the final system's performance in real-world operational conditions.  BENEFITS:  These all-weather shear stress sensors will have numerous applications in military and commercial markets.  Potential applications include 1) wind tunnel, water tank, flight, and track testing in commercial and government research laboratories, 2) monitoring for increased skin friction on aircraft employing laminar flow wings and drag reduction devices, and 3) detecting reversed flow and incipient stall on wings.",

Combining our expertise in device design and materials engineering, the Neocera-University of Maryland team proposes a novel device configuration by which the bandwidth of the filter is expected to remain fixed retaining the high-Q performance, as the filter's central frequency is tuned by an applied magnetic field. In this effort, HTS filters will be developed on YIG/GGG substrates and their frequency agile properties will be evaluated.

        "abstract": "A significant amount of effort has been applied to the extremely complex littoral environment, particularly in the area of acoustics.  The Navy's increasing requirements to operate in shallow water necessitates examination of the Navy's models for prediction of shallow water phenomena.  Ambient noise in shallow water is not well understood or well modeled.  Surf noise is a major contributor to ambient noise in shallow water and offshore.  Surf noise has been observed at distances well over 10 km seaward of the surf zone by operational Navy sonars (Stewart, 1994) and by a limited number of measurement exercises (O.B. Wilson, et al., 1985, Fabre and J.H. Wilson, 1995).  Surf noise is a shallow water phenomena that is only recently becoming understood.  It has been shown that surf noise is broadband noise that propagates from unique surf zones several kilometers to sea and can be dominate measured broadband ambient noise fields (Stewart, et al., 1994).  To ensure success in today's shallow water missions, the Navy needs a clear understanding of the propagation characteristics and noise fields.  A surf noise model (Wilson, et al., 1997; Fabre and Wilson, 1997) developed by Neptune Sciences, Inc. (NSI) and the Naval Postgraduate school (NPS)is based on an inverse technique in which the surf noise source level density (SLD) in the surf zone is deduced from ambient noise measurements taken many kilometers seaward of the surf zone.  The critical factor in applying this inverse technique is to be able to model the transmission loss (TL) accurately from points along the surf zone to the surf noise measurement location seaward.  Ambient noise due to shipping and local wind/wave-breaking are estimated and subtracted from the total noise measured.  The reason that the site dependent TL modeling is so critical is that, if done accurately, the SLDs estimated for surf should be site independent.  The SLD should only depend on frequency, wave height and type, and surf zone width and not on the propagation conditions from the surf zone, seaward.  Thus, once derived, the SLD can be used to estimate surf noise in other areas where surf noise measurements do not exist.  That is, the surf noise model (the SLD and TL model with inputs) can be used to accurately estimate surf noise at any location in the world.  These concepts will be illustrated with past surf noise data analyses performed by NSI/NPS (Wilson et al., 1997; Fabre and Wilson, 1997).",

        "abstract": "Demonstrate the feasibility to injection mold precise ceramic fiber optic ferrules using a high density, low pressure molding process and a rapid, fully automated, manufacturing cell. Injection molding has the potential to reduce the cost of ferrule manufacturing by molding blanks to near net shape, reducing the number of grinding operations, and to such precision that critical grinding steps are reduced or eliminated. However, the process is inherently more expensive than the process currently used to produce blanks, limiting the advantage of a near net shape. Precise process control for each individual part must be maintained during thermal operations to control minute distortions common to all ceramic product that will negate the advantage offered by a dimensionally precise blank. A high density, low pressure molding system provides low processing shrinkages and stresses for precise dimensional control. The proposed cell will produce blanks an order of magnitude faster than conventional processes at a cost similar to an extruded blank and with precise process control for each part. The process is continuous and economically dependent upon batch size, making possible the cost effective porduction of small volumes as well.",

        "abstract": "New dimension Research and Instruments proposed to develop an innovative optical CD drive, which allows simultaneously reading sixty-four bits at any given time. Different from any commercial available optical CD reader and writer (only one laser and one detector for reading one bit at any given time), there are at least 64 laser and detector pairs in our proposed the CD driver, which are built at same chip. It dramatically increases data processing time. The goal of the proposed phase I program is to demonstrate the feasibility to design and make a optical CD driver with a novel LDA chip. The major issue that must be resolved in the phase I program is to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed parallel read and write. The technical issues that must be resolved in the Phase I program are: 1. Determine optimum configuration for parallel read 32 bits from a rotating disk. 2. Determine optical parameters of VCSEL laser power, mode, f/number, and detector quantum efficiency, the laser and detector pitch for CD optical driver 3. Determine the optical parameters for focusing lens, tracking system Determine the optical disk formats for the parallel reading and writing.",

Specific impulse is higher than for electrothermal thrusters.  There are no electrodes or grids in contact with the plasma, so thruster lifetime should be better than other schemes.  The simple plasma geometry leads to easy scaling to larger or smaller thrusters.  Power densities can be much higher than for electrostatic ion thrusters (greater than a factor of 100) because there is no space charge limit on density.  In spite of these advantages, RF plasma thrusters have not come into use in electric propulsion because of poor measured efficiency in tests.  New England Space Works proposes an innovation to the RF plasma thruster which should greatly increase its efficiency.",

The SOI process based on hydrogen-implantation, wafer splitting, and wafer bonding is the newest and the cheapest approach to SOI fabrication. We propose to develop hydrogen-implanted SOI wafer process for production with a focus on improving the quality of SOI thus improving radiation hardness of the buried oxide in SOI-based devices.  A problem for SOI material as related to radiation hard microelectronics is a positive charge trapping in buried SiO2 layer. The trapping sensitivity is 10 to 100 times higher than in conventional thermal oxide layer. This prevents the use of SOI as a mainstream starting material for military and commercial VLSI. We have already determined that implantation and bonding do not cause quality decreasing of the buried oxide. The charge trapping is caused by two neighboring and opposite internal Si/SiO2 interfaces.  Our approach to solve the trapping problem is novel additional step in SOI wafer processing. This is high dose ionizing irradiation of wafers with subsequent annealing. This treatment decreases drastically internal stress in the SOI sandwich thus highly decreasing density of traps for holes in buried oxide and at both toD and bottom Si/SiO2 interfaces. New variations of SOI process also suggested to improve quality of SOI wafers.",

This project seeks to evaluate a new nanostructure adsorbent material that has a highly novel form and properties.  This material is very large and highly branched at the molecular level and is known as dendrimer due to its dendritic branching structure.  The use of dendrimers as adsorbents potentially offers the capability for high adsorption of hydrogen gas as well as a significant potential for natural gas storage and transport.  Phase I will evaluate dendrimers using both molecular simulation and experimental development in order to characterize the material.  The effort will build upon previous work in which nanostructured material was synthesized and characterized for utilization in gas technologies.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The recent breakthroughs in nanostructured materials offers a unique opportunity for more efficient separation processes.

        "abstract": "In the 14 years since the last revision of SNAME's Design Guide for Shipboard Airborne  Noise Control, acoustic prediction techniques and control methods have significantly  improved.  Current prediction techniques effectively utilize sophisticated computer  programs.  These could possibly be tied to CAD/CAE programs.  NCE believes that the  government, naval architects and shipyards can greatly benefit from these improvements.  When properly implemented, this latest technology can improve the noise and vibration  environment on all vessels.  At the same time, associated adverse impacts on space,   weight, maintainability of systems, and cost will be reduced.  This process would   also provide an integrated systems approach while reducing the effort needed to   predict and control noise on-board vessels.  Many of the approaches used in Statistical  Energy Analysis can be easily coded and used by any engineer involved in the design   process.  Noise control treatment types and their expected effectiveness have also   changed.  These changes can be factored into various databases.  Databases can be   setup for machinery and equipment acoustic source levels; airborne, structureborne,   and waterborne path transmission effects; and acoustic characteristics of materials  used in shipboard constructions.  This software would be very effective for predicting   and reducing noise on all types of vessels.",

        "abstract": "The fabrication of highly efficient Faraday-active optical waveguide structures is proposed. Faraday-active waveguides are presently of great interest as their development is the critical enabling technology associated with the demonstration of an all-fiber optical circulator. Such devices, which may be characterized as multiport nonreciprocal polarization rotators, provide a means by which the telecommunications rate may be immediately doubled on existing optical fiber carrier infrastructure. Successful implementation will lead to full-duplex operation over                                                                  passive, and does not therefore require external clocking controls. Separation of the signals is based only upon propagation direction; no additional losses are imposed on transmitted signals, as in the case of conventional directional couplers.  We propose the use of advanced thin film techniques in the development of optical fiber segments that exhibit Faraday rotation through the introduction of high Verdet constant materials. The proposed technology will replace conventional bulk optics technologies, as waveguide structures with dramatically- improved figures of merit will be developed and characterized during the initial Phase I period. The Phase I program also includes the advancement of fiber fabrication methods and a design assessment for optical circulator prototype development.",

The current systems that are in place allow misinterpretation and transposition of data due to human-induced errors during conversion from printed form to electronic form.  Hands-free technologies such as direct electrical contact, optical coupling, magnetic coupling, and RF transmission will be studied for the transfer of data.  The operating environment of the electronic ID tag system, as it will be called in this proposal, will be studied to determine the required resilience to temperature extremes, dirt, and chemicals.  An open- architecture design will be developed to transfer information between the ID tag and standard software that is already in existence on personal computers.  Current manufacturer's identification plates and configuration labels will be studied to determine the amount of data storage capacity that is required.  Size and weight of the electronic data system will be studied and optimized so as not to upset the functionality of the equipment being marked. NVE's experience with giant magnetoresistive (GMR) materials for memory and sensor applications will prove to be useful during the phase II effort.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of making Spin-Dependent Tunneling (SDT) materials with high temperature durability. These SDT materials will withstand the temperatures encountered during chip packaging and in standard CMOS back end processing, and they will demonstrate long term stability at operating temperatures to 150 \u00c2\u00bfC. Nonvolatile Electronics, Inc. has demonstrated the functionality of SDT devices at wafer level using photolithography techniques. These SDT devices have the high sensitivity (3%/Oe), necessary for very low field applications, and have high impedance (1 to lOOM-Ohm um2), leading to very lower power consumption. However, they show relatively poor thermal stability, which will be an obstacle for making either discrete or integrated devices. A Phase II program will further optimize the materials/device properties and integrate SDT devices with standard CMOS semiconductor technology and standard chip packaging. Memory, logic, and sensor functions will be demonstrated in Phase II using these optimized structures. There are immediate commercial opportunities for magnetic field and current sensing devices, low power isolators, solid state relays, and magnetic random access memories.",

        "abstract": "The proposed research program will develop and demonstrate two giant magnetoresistance magnetic sensors for electronic fuzing:  one sensor, which will detect gun tube exit of a projectile, will be for safety and arming of a non-spinning projectile, and the other sensor, a spin counter, will count projectile revolutions. Performance goals for the spin count sensor are: 0.02 Oe minimum detectable field, 10 ms recovery after removal of a 1000 Oe disturb field, operation from -50 to +145 F, accuracy of +/- 0.5% out to a target range of 1 km, and signal bandwidth of 500 kHz. The gun tube exit sensor will work with a sensor-to-gun tube gap of up to 2 inches.  Both sensors will have CMOS compatible outputs with a +3 to +5 V power supply.  The specific technical objectives of this program are to: a) complete a cost and producibility analysis for the proposed magnetic sensors, b) design both gun tube exit detection and spin count sensors which will meet the performance requirements, c) develop performance predictions for the sensors, d) fabricate and test prototypes of both GMR sensors, and e) deliver sensor prototypes for evaluation.  The success of this Phase I effort will demonstrate the feasibility of the GMR spin counter and exit sensor, and provide the basis for development of fully integrated versions under a Phase II program.

This design expertise is a delicate balance of high performance, low power, RF transceiver technology and flexible DSP for waveform generation and demodulation.  Furthermore, an operational sensitivity is required: large antennas, high powered transmitters, and extended transmissions typify high profile emissions which are inconsistent with SOCOM operations  Nova Engineering has the requisite experience to satisfy these technical and operational requirements:  Mr. Mark Dapper, the Principal Investigator and holder of the patent for the secure voice interoperability waveform, has been designing UHF SATCOM transceivers since 1977; other team members contribute similar expertise.

A crucial link in the WIN communications hierarchy is the Future Digital Radio (FDR), which will provide a high speed digital link as well as an interface between the WIN and users of selected legacy radios.

This special glass fiber will exhibit both ultra high gain coefficient and extremely low cost, less than 1% of today's price. Our goal is to demonstrate a gain coefficient greater than 5dB/cm in this special glass fiber . Therefore, the length of the Er3+--doped fiber for amplifiers will be as short as 5cm. Such a unique short fiber amplifier is the ideai choice to construct an integrated, compact, and rugged lossless beam splitter, which is one of the key devices to realize Fiber-To-The-Home (FTTH).

Solar blind ultraviolet avalanche photodetectors and position sensitive arrays with high sensitivity have broad applications in military, space, automotive, engine monitoring, flame detection, and environmental monitoring.  The Al(x)Ga(1-x)N direct wide bandgaps covers from 3.4 to 6.2eV corresponding to a wavelength range of 365 to 200nm.  These are ideal materials for developing UV photodetectors due to relatively high mobility, sharp cut-off wavelength, and high quantum efficiency.  In Phase I, we will demonstrate the feasibility of the GaN/AlGaN APD solar blind photodetectors through the use of modeling and iterative fabrication runs.  To overcome the high dislocation density problem found in traditional III-nitride MOCVD growth methods, we will use a novel approach to device structures coupled with the proven MOCVD technique.  Using this novel APD structure we can effectively reduce dislocation density and fabricate the homojunctions and heterostructures, which are ultimately required by the APD device.  In Phase II, we will refine the device designs, improve device performance, and to bring this high sensitivity ultraviolet detector to the marketplace.

Current electro-optic (E-O) materials and devices do not provide fast enough response time for military use, especially for personnel protection from Q-switched lasers.  Our goal is to develop advanced oxide materials for the fabrication of fast E-O device which will fulfill critical military requirements.  Advanced complex oxides are particularly suitable for E-O devices due to their large E-O coefficients, fast response times, broad specttum bandwidths, wide range of operating temperatures and physical ruggedness.  In this Phase I program, we will demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach by fabricating a prototype device via an innovative metalorganic chemical liquid deposition (MOCLD) process.  The electric response time of the device will be minimized by our innovative device structure.  Due to the anticipated rapid growth in the optical communication market, the technology development will also find many applications in the private sector.  BENEFITS: Laser protective devices have enormous commercial applications for safety and health equipment due to the proliferation of lasers in laboratories, academia, industry and medicine.  Besides laser protection, the proposed low cost, high performance E-O materials and devices will open a potentially large market for laser printers, fiber optic switches and optical interconnections.

The focus-of-attention algorithms are robust with respect to misregistration effects and differential illumination and determine the likely areas of possible change.  Knowledge of the approximate location and size of change regions reduces tremendously the computational requirements of object-level analysis and provides good initial estimates for processing parameters.  Detailed analysis and matching of segmented regions is used to determine locations of actual physical change.

At critical angles of attack, the vortex shedding becomes asymmetric due to micro-imperfections present at the nose of the body.

The research effort will investigate the effectiveness of introducing retractable miniature flow devices at the nose of a tangent ogive forebody to fix separation points and force the vortex shedding to become symmetric, thus alleviating excessive side forces.

A way to circumvent this issue is to generate the accelerating fields using short bunches of electrons that induce a periodic localized wake field in a dielectric-lined wave-guide.  This project will develop a method for achieving high accelerating gradients using a train of bunches, thus allowing future high-gradient research accelerators to be a fraction of the cost of presently envisioned machines.  If one drive bunch sets up the wake fields, it must be highly intense; but with several moderately intense bunches, comparable fields are induced if the interbunch spacing equals the wake field period.  A dielectric-lined cylindrical waveguide has been designed wherein moderately intense bunches induce many waveguide modes, and where the wake field period equals the interbunch spacing.  In Phase I a 50-60 cm long dielectric-lined wake field accelerator module will be built to be installed in an accelerator test facility.  The frequency spectrum of fields induced by passage of a single drive bunch and energy loss of the drive bunch will both be measured.  These would be the first steps in the construction of a dielectric wake field accelerator using several decelerated drive bunches and a trailing accelerated test bunch.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   Availability of a high-gradient accelerator that did not require an external high-power high frequency rf source and associated rf components would allow future high energy electron-positron research accelerators to be built using available technology, at a fraction of the cost of systems requiring external sources.  Industrial accelerators with high acceleration gradients would be more compact than current designs, with concomitant savings._",

An active pulse compressor, using oversized waveguides and electrically-switchable Bragg reflectors, is already being developed.  Components for matching this compressor to the rf source and the accelerator are required.   In  Phase I, design and preliminary tests will be carried out on high-power 11.4 GHz components at low power (~100kW).  During Phase II, high power tests to produce compressed output pulses of 100 MW and above are to be carried out, using the 11.4 GHz Omega-P/NRL magnicon.   Components are required to provide a good match between the rf source and the compressor, and between the compressor and the accelerator module.  These components include mode converters, oversized low-loss waveguides, and a quasi-optical 3dB bi-directional coupler.  Design, fabrication and tests of these components will be carried out for incorporation with the Active Bragg Compressor now under development.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   As R&D on high-gradient TeV-range colliders advances, there should be demand for high power rf sources for laboratory tests of accelerating structures and associated high-power components.

Development of high gradient accelerating structures and associated high-power microwave components will be stymied without such a high-frequency source.

In Phase I, preliminary experimental tests of gyroharmonic co-generation at 20 GHz will be performed.  These tests will employ a high quality 300 kilovolt, 30 ampere electron beam source and a 24 megawatt S-band klystron, and thus require little new design and construction.  A preliminary co-generator will be built to match the existing beam source.  Design computations will be carried out for advanced co-generators with higher output power and efficiency for Phase II experimental evaluations.

        "abstract": "Payloads in a launch vehicle are mounted on standard payload attachment fittings which provide no vibration isolation, imposing severe requirements on payload design.  There is a need for inexpensive and effective means to isolate the payload from vehicle vibration.  Complications include conflicting requirements for compactness, high static strength, widely varying static load, secure tiedown, low dynamic spring rate and little or no interaction with launch vehicle control dynamics.OmniTek proposes to address this need with a passive/active hybrid (semi-active) system in which the mechanism of isolation is passive and parameters of the mechanical system are automatically adjusted for varying launch conditions.  With the inclusion of a novel structural characteristic, the system can meet all the requirements without compromise.The objectives of Phase I are:1.  Analyze and characterize the launch environment and equipment to develop design specifications, guides and priorities.2.  Develop a number of alternative systems to the conceptual design stage for comparative evaluation.3.  Compare and rate the design alternatives against specifications and select one concept for development to the prototype stage.",

The compounds are covalently attached to a solid phase and can be used to selectively bind to toxins from various sources (e.g., body fluids or food extracts) for their detection and quantitation.  In this proposal is described the theoretical background for the construction and nature of the compounds, and their selective binding with the ricin agglutinin, the botulinum toxin A hemagglutinin component, and the botulinum A, B, and E neurotoxin components.  Data is presented that compounds can be obtained that will be selective for a host of other pathogenic toxins.  Using these toxin selective binding compounds, ELISA and other detection-quantitation assays will be developed for the ricin and botulinum toxins.  The sensitivities, reproducibilities, and applications of the assays will be tested by addition of purified toxins to serum/plasma and to selected foods, and the conduct of quantitative assay.  Because of the nature of the compounds binding to the toxins, it is expected that the compounds may also be used therapeutically to inhibit the toxin effects.  In Phase II, compounds that bind selectively to a number of additional toxins will be identified and quantitative assays constructed.  The assays would be used to quantify toxin levels in appropriate clinical situations and in the field.  BENEFITS:  The toxin-binding compounds are stable and assay tests can be constructed that can be stored at typical room temperatures and which would withstand higher temperatures that may be experienced in shipping or in the field. Thus, the assays could be used in a number of situations including medical and veterinary applications, as well as in the food industry.  The toxin binding compounds may also be used to inhibit toxin binding and thus neutralize the potential harmful physiological effects of the toxins.",

        "abstract": "For over two decades, researchers have investigated a wide variety of technologies for use as a real-time infrared scene generator. The key element necessary to develop a practical and cost effective infrared scene projector for test and evaluation of infrared sensors and seekers is a real-time thermal infrared scene generation device. During the past several years, the most promising technology to meet the myriad of infrared scene projection applications appears to be the silicon micromachined resistive -array approach where each thermal pixel is created by a micro-scale resistor. The principal objectives of this proposed effort by Optical E.T.C., Inc. (OETC) are to (I) investigate alternative technologies that could lead to the fabrication of affordable, rugged, uniform, and efficient high-performance emissive resistive thermal pixel arrays (TPA) and (2) begin exploring the potential for joining together multiple TPAs to produce a larger format TPA. The baseline TPA architecture to be considered will be based upon planar silicon micromachined CMOS technology. This research is relevant to the development of TPA technology for inclusion in a cost-effective high-fidelity, real-time infrared scene projector as an element of infrared sensor/seeker test and evaluation at Government and various commercial facilities.",

However, the full  potential of these systems can only be realized if the target states can be  accurately estimated. Traditional methods for target state estimation using Kalman  filters based on white-noise driven models may not be able to deliver the accuracies  required to achieve hit-to-kill capabilities. This proposal advances a target state  estimator incorporating an adaptive maneuver logic system. Using the seeker  measurements, and a transformed model of the target, the proposed estimator will  determine the target maneuver strategies on-line while generating accurate state  estimates. Phase I research will establish the feasibility of the proposed target  state estimator, and compare its performance with a conventional Kalman filter-based  target state estimator. This evaluation will be carried out using a six  degrees-of-freedom missile simulation incorporating a high performance autopilot  and an advanced differential game-based homing guidance law.

Continued evolution of digital CMOS technology processors can provide the basis for supporting these requirements; Giga-op single chip processing devices will be available in the near future.  However this increase in processing power will not necessarily  result in higher performance embedded military processing systems.

Tunable Fabry-Perot (F-P) filters have desirable features of high throughput (much needed in the mid-IR region where detectors are of low sensitivity), high resolution, fast-scanning capability, and applicability to 2-D scene spectral imaging. However, F-P filters are difficult to fabricate for the mid-IR region. Homogeneous metal films cannot be used due to high absorptivity, and multi-layer dielectric films are difficult to fabricate, are limited by available materials, and may not exhibit sufficiently high reflectance for desired high finesse.  This project offers a novel approach to the development of tunable F-P filters for the mid-IR spectral range. The properties of the proposed F-P are essentially independent of fabrication material, but are instead dependent on the geometrical pattern and its dimensions. Furthermore, the proposed fabrication technique uses standard lithographic methods, which impart cost efficiency and excellent quality control. In Phase I, test filter elements will be fabricated and transmission properties of a breadboard tunable filter will be measured and compared to theoretical expectations.  This technology will enable fabrication of low cost/high performance tunable infrared filters for the addition of spectral selectivity to numerous sensing platforms.",

Cleveland Medical Devices will design a complete ambulatory muscle fatigue monitor that will utilize wireless telemetry and advanced signal processing techniques to allow researchers to record and monitor muscle fatigue in soldiers without the need to be tethered to a cumbersome EMG monitor. For the Phase I program, Cleveland Medical Devices will design a small, lightweight, unobtrusive three channel differential EMG amplifier/transmitter using proven wireless technology to digitize and transmit the EMG data to a PC compatible computer for storage and data processing. Then the mean power frequency of the EMG signal will be calculated and used to indicate local muscle fatigue.  BENEFITS:  There are many potential commercial applications for small, rugged three channel telemetry devices. Some potential biological applications are: rehabilitation, physical therapy, medical research, ergonomic design of equipment and tasks, and remote patient care. Some other commercial applications are: vehicle monitoring, robotic communications, short range voice communications, wireless data acquisition, simple local area networks and industrial process monitoring and control.",

The prototype smart surface will consist of an adaptive/predictive controller, an integrated array of microsensors and Deployable Micro-Vortex Generators (DMVGs).  The smart surface will be tested on an airfoil where sensors will be able to discern flow conditions indicative of flow separation and deploy the DMVGs.  In response, the DMVGs will generate vortices into the freestream, energizing the boundary layer.  The DMVGs will make the flow less susceptible to separate from the surface of the airfoil, inhibiting stall and providing additional lift for the aircraft.  The smart surface will be able to retract the DMVGs, subtracting the drag caused by the passive vortex generators during normal cruise flight.The engineering prototype will be tested in Phase I at the subsonic wind tunnel at the Ohio State University.  The control strategy used to prevent separation will be determined.  During this program, the controller will demonstrate its ability to actuate the DMVGs in response to sensor inputs regarding flow conditions incipient to surface flow separation.

        "abstract": "Under this SBIR program, ORINCON proposes to demonstrate algorithms to perform detection, localization, and tracking of targets in shallow-water scenarios where the primary measurements available are bearing (time difference of arrival at two phase centers) versus time.  The approach used is Track-Before-Detect processing.  The term Track-Before-Detect refers to the joint estimation-detection process involved when several time epochs of the basic measurements are combined in such a way as to include the temporal processing gain available from integrating over the total time span associated with the measurements.  This utilization of the past data samples however does not need to imply an equivalent time-late as the processing will be done recursively and the information from the past is stored in the state parameters associated with the hypothesized tracks of the targets. A similar more restrictive process is currently being used at ORINCON in connection with the Full Spectrum Program.  The restrictive feature alluded to is that the presently implemented \u00c2\u00bfHough Transform\u00c2\u00bf assumes the time difference versus time track is sufficiently short enough to be approximated by a straight line.  The utilization of the \u00c2\u00bfGeneralized Hough Transform\u00c2\u00bf as proposed by NRL will remove this restriction.",

Worst-case turbine engine inspection and maintenance procedures are very expensive, and all parts of a given type must be replaced after a fixed number of hours, regardless of the fatigue and wear that they have experienced. A less restrictive high-fatigue schedule can reduce costs, but may result in a larger number of catastrophic failures. By analyzing the vibrational modes and performance parameters of an operating turbine engine, one can determine the extent of degredation due to fatigue without the necessity of dismantling the engine and performing a detailed inspection of its components.

Our engine health diagnostic (EHD) system uses advanced spectral estimation techniques, model-based condition algorithms, and neural network processing will be integrated to detect mechanical flaws and predict failures. The proposed system will combine operational engine parameters and vibration data from engine accelerometers using ORINCON's advanced spectral estimation techniques, neural net processing, and multisensor fusion.  The result of this effort, an automated diagnostic system to detect and localize small flaws in rotating machinery, has broad commercial application. Prevention of catastrophic failure and the significant savings to be realized from on-condition maintenance are benefits that have high value across the spectrum of military and civilian operations involving gas turbine engines and other rotating machinery.

Here, ORINCON proposes a novel approach that consists of a number of interconnected processors operating in pipelined and parallel modes to support several types of adaptive nulling algorithms.  The design will comprise a mixed architecture with Field Programmable Gate Arrays and Field Programmable Interface Connections for programmable interconnects for programmable logic, ASIC's; such as DSP chips for the floating point operations, and CORDIC processors for coordinate rotations to triangularize matrices.  Innovative hardware platforms, such as the novel architecture mentioned above, blur the traditional boundaries that exist between hardware and software bringing out the best features of both environments.

We will design an integrated environment in which security and conflict management features can be synthesized and distributed efficiently, with capability for creation of robust agent software specifically designed to protect networked agent-based systems.  Protection will be achieved through an integrated approach:  (1) multiple layers of security assurance, capable of evolving with time, (2) unique measures tailored to specific subversion methodologies, (3) real-time conflict management, and (4) security system self-protection.  The architecture will balance additional computational burdens against current policy, scope of threat, and resource conflict potential.     ORINCON brings extensive experience as a developer of agent-based systems and distributed agent security systems for Information Warfare.

This 500-MHz analyzer is estimated to fit on four 6U VME cards using a combination of two unique VME card designs in its un-pipelined configuration (.5 Mpps throughput) or twenty VME cards in its pipeline configuration (10 Mpps throughput).  The design concept can be arranged in a second configuration that performs a 1-GHz bandwidth analysis, which is estimated to fit on eight 6U VME cards using a different combination of the two VME card designs.

Current systems in use are based on proprietary hardware and software architectures.  These proprietary systems are expensive to procure and support and are difficult to expand.  Technical innovation is typically limited to the system supplier.  Modern computer technology is enabling the development of nonproprietary open architecture vibration data collectors using a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) portable computer system and a simple Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) vibration data acquisition card.  ORINCON proposes to develop a PCMCIA six-channel vibration acquisition system, vibration signal processing software, and suitable user interface for shipboard vibration acquisition, processing, storage, display, and communication.  The proposed system utilizes state-of-the-art electronics found in modern audio equipment as a basis for the PCMCIA vibration acquisition card.  A standard laptop computer running Window 95/NT provides the signal processing, data storage, and communication capabilities.  Signal processing and display functions are implemented in RIPPEN*.  RIPPEN* is ORINCON's unique open architecture signal processing middieware software that allows rapid development and portability of signal processing and diagnostic software.  A MIMOSA compliant CBM database will be selected and interfaced with and a detailed specification of the system and signal processing demonstration will be conducted as part of the Phase I effort.  A complete prototype will be developed in Phase 11.",

        "abstract": "As electronic devices become smaller, faster and more complex, their need for high heat dissipation turns into a pressing concern. Cumbersome cooling systems such as large heat sinks, forced air cooling and fluid cooling are impractical and need to be replaced by alternative, small size, light weight thermal management techniques. Particularly promising in this respect are thermoelectric modules due to their relatively light weight and potential for high heat dissipation. However, up to now, conventional thermoelectric materials and fabrication techniques have been costly and incapable of producing small size, high efficiency thermoelectric modules. This proposal suggests a novel set of composite thermoelectric materials as well as suitable designs that can be used to fabricate compact, high performance, light weight thermoelectric modules. The advantages of these novel thermoelectric materials are low cost, high productivity, low temperature process and capable of producing small size, high efficiency thermoelectric modules. These modules can be fabricated as individual thermoelectric modules as well as integrated into the electronic or other component that requires cooling to gain maximum effectiveness with minimum additional space. The fabrication techniques that will be used to fabricate high performance, compact thermoelectric modules are already established and will be modified for this application.",

Control light pulses are delivered through fibers traveling in alternate paths through the structure to control the on - off operation of the power semiconductor in a logic or function directly.

Incorporating low-loss components into power-electronic based systems is a concern from the standpoint of system stability due to the inherent low resistance of the cryogenic components which may tend to destabilize the system due to reduced damping. The purpose of the work proposed herein is first to investigate the stability of this type of GTR system. This is to be accomplished by first defining a baseline GRT system configuration and then determining the parameters, and the variation thereof, in order to approximate the operating characteristics of the proposed cryogenic GTR. The overall goal, however, is to conduct a first-look into optimizing performance, weight, and cost of a GTR system in regard to system stability. Optimization studies will focus first on small-disturbance stability and then on large-excursion stability with a pulsed load present. During this research, a new and innovative means of eliminating negative- impedance instability, which has recently been shown to be effective on a noncryogenic power- electronic based system, will be considered as a means of reducing the weight requirements by decreasing the number and size of the system capacitors for a low-loss GTR system. The possible use of this stabilizer control in a pulsed-load environment has not been investigated. Moreover, the possible interaction of the various system controllers, including the stabilizer control, will be investigated with a focus on achieving optimum system performance through appropriate coordination or modification of the system controllers.",

This approach, which is referred to as an automated state model generator (ASMG),  markedly reduces the engineering time needed to implement a detailed simulation that is typically orders of magnitude faster than using other circuit-based approaches.  In spite of these breakthroughs, the complexity of typical systems that are being considered by DoD agencies is such that it remains impractical to implement a detailed simulation of the entire system in a homogeneous computational environment on even the most powerful workstations using commercial simulation programs.  The objective of the Phase I research is to determine the feasibility of an automated model interconnection algorithm for the F22 electrical power subsystem that selects component models of the appropriate detail, identifies potential model-order reductions, identifies computational subsystems to be implemented on parallel networked computers, and supplies the appropriate information to the server to synchronize the overall simulation.

Infrared focal plane arrays (FPAs) have historically required the post-processing operations of two-point spatial nonuniformity correction (NUC) to compensate for gain and offset variations between the thousands (or hundreds of thousands) of pixel channels on the device. Through the development of other on-FPA features which have been implemented in the analog domain in massively parallel implementations, Pacific Advanced Technology (PAT) has laid the groundwork for the application of a complete automatic two-point NUC operation which could be hosted directly on the FPA itself.  Test structures which have been included on a recent PAT-designed silicon wafer produced with 0.5 micron CMOS technology at the Hewlett Packard MOSIS foundry will be available to this program with no investment of time or money.

        "abstract": "We propose an innovative new solution to satellite communications on the move which uses photonic technology. There are several approaches to this problem of pointing and tracking which depend on various implementations of actively controlled phased array antennas.  Our system is radically different in that we use what amounts to an automatic optically controlled phase array system.  It relies upon the phase conjugation of the RF/microwave signal beams.  In this systems approach/which has been recently demonstrated, optical interconnections provide the key enabling technology by reducing weight and complexity.  The process of wavefront conjugation permits us to have pointing, autotracking, and conformal mounting of the antenna arrays in low profile configurations.  Operationally, a weak probe beam from a receiver such as a satellite is conjugated, modulated with the communications information and amplified.  The conjugated transmitted beam then returns, automatically and directly to the moving system, which in this case is the satellite. Interesting additional features in this system are that it also corrects for any distortions, or aberrations, in the path and that it possesses many intrinsic security aspects. The system is also inherently robust, relatively low cost and extremely well suited to high frequency communications with moving platforms.  BENEFITS:  This low cost automatic tracking system has major applications to moving vehicles. Since the system only sends and receives signals with the designated target, communications are secure and low power. The tracking operates at the speed of the conjugation process - which is virtually instantaneous.  In addition to military applications we see this system as potentially useful -for every commercial car, truck, and plane.",

In Phase I the requirements and Preliminary Design are validated by Concept Demonstration prototype.  The system fuses the panoramic view of the outside world with information provided by sensors and digital systems.  Sensory and digital system information can be presented in a graphical and alpha-numeric form located appropriately within the 3D panorama and as 2D head-up displays.  The view provided is wholly synthetic, presented either in a multiple flat panel panorama, or in a virtual reality visor.  The user of the system can select the information presented.  The primary controls for information display and interaction with digital systems are head-up graphical user interfaces.  Head-up controls and 2D displays follow the user's gaze.  The method is compatible with use by other tank crew members, and by infantry fighting vehicle and attack helicopter crews.",

Further, the antenna could be deionized when not in use, which will substantially reduce its radar cross-section and thus it's detectability (stealth).  When used as an impulse transmitter, extremely short pulses are possible by deionizing the antenna to prevent ringing associated with traditional antenna configurations, thus combining the benefits of low probability of intercept (outgoing signal) with low probability of detection (stealth).  Further, the extremely short impulse(because ringing was prevented) will allow substantially improved wavelet decomposition of the return with less computational overhead.

AMTEC power converters need internal wick structures comprised of evaporator, artery, and condenser components to circulate liquid sodium using capillary forces.  However, there is no existing technology to fabricate wicks that can operate at high temperature for long times during these missions.   The objective of this project is to develop wicks for AMTEC power converters that are micromachined from refractory metals.  These micromachined, capillary wicks will:  (1) be fabricated from refractory metals to achieve a 15-year lifetime at the high operating temperatures of the alkali metal cells, (2) be micromachined with small capillary features (2-3 micron dimensions) for high capillary head and operation at temperatures from 1100-1200 degrees Kelvin, and (3) operate with a low temperature difference between the heat source and the evaporation site for good thermal control.   In Phase I, refractory metals will be bonded in porous and foil forms, capillary features will be micromachined into the structure using a laser, and the performance (capillary head and permeability) of the evaporator will be evaluated.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   The micromachined capillary wick benefits DOE and NASA by enabling spacecraft radioisotope power systems with a 15-year life and up to one-third the weight of current thermoelectric systems.  This technology could also benefit DoD (Air Force) by enabling power conversion systems to operate in high-radiation orbits.

Dodd Stacy, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG02-98ER82558\nAmount:  $50,348\n\nXenon gas that is isotopically enriched with a variety of xenon isotopes can be used as an inhaled or injected imaging agent to produce very clear images of specific organs and blood flow by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).  These images are vital for accurate diagnosis and treatment of brain and lung disorders.  However, the enriched xenon are extremely expensive, and relatively large amounts are required for each clinical study.  Current xenon dispenser and recovery systems trap the gas in a charcoal activated filter which is later disposed of, wasting the xenon isotope, greatly increasing the cost of each procedure, and adding to the radioactive waste stream.  This project deals with a method to enable widespread use of expensive xenon isotopes in MRI and SPECT imaging.  The innovation is a cryogenic gas trap that separates the xenon from the patient\u00c2\u00bfs exhaled breath and stores it for re-use.  Phase I will prove the feasibility by demonstrating the operation of a compact xenon separation system.  Efficient xenon recovery will be demonstrated in a cryogenic gas trap, an optimal cryocooler will be selected, and a system that can be integrated with existing xenon dispenser systems will be designed.  Phase II will complete the development of a prototype and operation will be proved in clinical trials.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   The xenon recovery and recycle system will be a key component in xenon dispensers for low-cost, high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of blood flow and organs.

        "abstract": "Creare proposes an innovative design for audio command, control, and communication systems.  The Creare auditory system employs active noise reduction (ANR) that will reduce the harmful effects of high noise levels on personnel while simultaneously enhancing the speech intelligibility of electronic messages.  Currently available off-ths-shelf ANR audio systems only provide between 10-20 dB of noise reduction for frequencies between 0.1 and 1 kHz and the feedback algorithm they employ attenuates injected electronic messages as well as unwanted environmental noise.  The Creare innovation uses a feedforward controller which provides the ability to inject electronic messages that are unaffected by the ANR algorithm.  This approach will result in a greater level of noise reduction and bandwidth than is possible with feedback algorithms, thereby enhancing audio command and communication systems. In Phase I, we will conduct a system engineering analysis of the design, develop the feedforward controller, and fabricate a laboratory system for testing.  The key outcome of this effort will be demonstration hardware and preliminary data.  In Phase II, we will optimize the design, fabricate prototypes of the optimized design, and perform laboratory and field tests of the prototype units to verify compliance with desired specifications.",

        "abstract": "Corrosion problems experienced by military equipment are severe and expensive; estimates for the Navy alone are more than $1 billion annually.  To reduce these costs it is imperative that equipment be monitored for exposure to corrosive environments.  Quantitative monitoring programs will help to better understand how to best mitigate the effects of these environments.  The opportunity presented here is the development of an integrated environmental monitoring system so that data which characterizes the corrosivity of the environment can be gathered.  The instrument will incorporate an innovative integrated sensor suite capable of monitoring temperature, humidity, rainfall conductivity, and corrosivity (e.g. galvanic activity) data over a wide-range of operating conditions. The data acquisition system will be based on a small but sophisticated Micro- Computer Unit which will gather data over long periods of time.  Use of this advanced technology will result in a small, lightweight system which can be used in shipboard, airborne, and ground station applications. The primary focus in Phase I is to prove the feasibility by 1) integrating sensors which can accurately and reliably measure these parameters into a stand-alone package using thin-film deposition techniques and 2) demonstrating a prototypical signal conditioning and data acquisition system with remote data retrieval capabilities.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in multi-kilowatt semiconductor laser arrays have pushed solid-state laser output power into the KW range.  Unfortunately, the output beam quality of diode-pumped solid-state lasers using Nd:YAG and Yb:YAG bulk crystals degrades with increasing pump power and is basically limited by the thermal induced effects inside the non-linear lasing rods.  To some extent, good beam quality can be maintained by distributing the pump power uniformly inside the crystal.  Even then thermal lensing or self- focusing could still occur, initiating from localized inhomogeneities.  To eliminate this serious problem, this proposal introduces a novel concept for establishing a uniform distribution of pump power by using a multicore fiber bundle from which phase-locking can be obtained to emit a single central beam spot with very high brightness as a result of a strong coupling of the evanescent waves inside the cladding.Recently, the output power in the range from 30 to 50W has been achieved by diode-pumping of a single core Nd-doped or Yb-doped fiber laser.  To increase the power delivery from these fiber lasers, this proposal describes a laser system consisting of a 2-D phase-locked fiber bundle, uniquely configured in a 2-D staggered array in a common cladding with a specified intercore spacing between two adjacent fibers, so that the multicore system is phase-locked in unit-phase to emit the desired fundamental supermode.  By using co-doping technology, very high power in excess of one kilowatt can be achieved with Yb:Er codoped multicore fiber bundle emitting at an eye-safe wavelength.  In Phase I, an in-depth study will be conducted to assess potential dual-use of the selected laser technology.  Also, a detailed design analysis will be conducted to determine critical parameters required to fabricate the selected laser.  In addition, a novel packaging concept for the multicore fiber bundle will be attempted and experimentally verified.  The results will be used as the basic guideline for developing a prototype to be demonstrated in Phase II.",

These lasers achieved extraordinarily high power outputs:4.6W in CW operation from a 200um aperture BW-SCH 1500nm InGaAsP/InP laser                   diodes:13.3W in quasi-continuous-wave (QCW) operation and 6.8W in CW operation from a 100            micron aperture BW-SCH 980nm InGaAs/(In)GaAs(p)/InGaP laser diodes.The BW-SCH devices employ comprehensive strain multi-quantum well (MQW) structures known to reduce the linewidth enhancement factor   (4.5).  Furthermore these devices achieve high power output power at relatively narrow aperture, thus producing a high quality, non-filamentary beam, suitable for collimation and/or fiber coupling (2).

The square canopy developed in Phase II will be capable of surviving deployment speeds and suspended weights as specified (300 knots and 293-342 lbs.)  In addition, the canopy developed will reduce the rate of descent from the current canopy (round type) in service, while conforming to the deployment modes and dimensions of the current ACES II headbox unit.  The square canopy developed should not require any manipulation from the user in order to achieve the desired rate of descent (ROD) for landing.",

The camera has to be high resolution both in terms of the number of pixels and the bit resolution of its analog-to-digital converter. The CMOS APS is a recently developed high performance CMOS image sensor technology compatible with the on-chip integration of CMOS circuits for signal processing and analog-to-digital conversion.  This gives the CMOS APS unprecedented potential to combine high performance imaging with advanced signal processing circuits such as high resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADC).  The availability of on-chip ADC with resolutions up to 16 bits will provide tremendous advantages to camera system designers by eliminating costly and difficult external 16 bit ADC circuits.  This simplifies system design, reduces board space requirements and lower overall system power consumption.  In Phase I, a monochrome digital APS camera will be developed.  This camera will be based around a digital APS imager with 512x512-pixel resolution and on-chip 12-bit analog-to-digital converter.  This camera will be capable of operating at 10Hz or better for the full array. In Phase III, marketable prototype camera will be developed with 1024x1024 resolution, 16-bit digital resolution, and 10 Hz or better frame rate.",

The proposed detector will be specifically designed for x-ray microanalysis to provide orders of magnitude advancement in the performance over conventional energy dispersive systems. During the Phase 1 effort of this project, we successfully designed, fabricated, and demonstrated a ~2cm2 silicon drift detector (SDD) array. All of the goals of Phase 1 were met, and most were significantly exceeded. Accomplishments included development of a closely spaced array of four 0.5 cm2 SDD elements. Energy resolution of 143 eV FWHM at 5.9 keV was achieved on the best device. All four devices produced energy resolution below 200 eV FWHM. Importantly, these results were obtained at relatively short peaking times and additionally the detectors do not require cryogenic cooling to obtain this performance. \n\nIn Phase 2, we will develop a prototype x-ray spectrometer for insertion into an electron microscope. The prototype will include the finalized detector array of up to four elements based upon the Phase 1 study. Each element will be capable of attaining electronic noise of ",

Ideally, a simulation user can select a level of simulation resolution and response time that varies in range, from within the same simulation framework.  The range could vary from a detailed, high resolution model that supports the design and engineering of a hardware component to an abstract, low resolution model that supports the simulation of a theater level conflict.  Variable-resolution techniques that can provide this capability would support the end-to-end simulation of the system acquisition cycle.This effort identifies and prototypes variable-resolution techniques to provide a multi-level simulation modeling capability for spacecraft within the Spacecraft Simulation Toolkit (SST) framework.

This program designs instrumentation suites with broad application to lethality testing.  Phase I assesses novel and conventional measures of weapon damage.  It matches the measurements with damage modes, and assesses the information content of the signal.  Promising approaches are matched with classes of weapon/target pairs.  These are the basis for concepts recommended for further exploration and development.  Phase II prototypes the lethality instrumentation systems.  Sensor suites are assembled, and preliminary integrating software is implemented.  These systems are refined and validated in live fire tests performed by the Government.  Lethality test support systems to be developed under Phase III are selected for their demonstrated utility. The proposed program will identify accessible battle damage assessment signals as a natural product of well instrumented lethality tests.

The primary obstacle to widespread use of IR/Radar with real-time out-the-window simulations is the low level of automation in the development of WIT maps. This Phase I effort will define, prototype and evaluate a system for the rapid production of WIT maps from visible imagery and numerous disparate data layers, including raw and processed NIMA, DTED and DFAD data and digital cartographic data.  Neural networks will be trained on imagery to recognize the                                         spectral and collateral inputs.  The use of collateral inputs offers a vast improvment over previous neural networks material classification research which focuses solely on spectral characteristics of the data.

        "abstract": "Advanced armor composites offer lightweight designs using unique materials, laminated together, to provide the same protection as its metal counterpart.  Using these different material designs also means dealing with different types of defects. Delaminations between the different layers of materials are the most commonly encountered defects which need to be found and characterized during normal inspection procedures. Inspection of this material to find delaminations, with conventional, high frequency, ultrasonic methods is not possible and justifies the development of new inspection methods. One possible solution is to study oblique incidence waves that are reflected from delaminations, and develop an Acousto-Ultrasonic approach. Preliminary studies have shown that measurements made below 300 kHz with the incidence angle varying between -20\u00c2\u00bf and +20\u00c2\u00bf, yield promising results. This study will demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach and ultimately deliver a probe/system concept that will form the basis of a prototype inspection instrument.  BENEFITS:  It is anticipated that the results of this study will lead to the development of a unique inspection instrument useful for detecting delaminations and other defects in thick, multi-layered composite.  It will be effective as an acceptance tool for newly fabricated material and for in-service fleld inspection where only one surface is available for measurements. Besides being useful for lightweight armor composites, we see its use being extended to the automotive industry where composites will eventually find its way into the design of primary load carrying structure. In addition, we believe that other markets will benefit from this type of instrument such as in the Aerospace industry for both fixed and rotary wing aircraft fabricated from composites as well as future bridge structures that will be built from composite materials. There is already a need for such a device for Natural Gas Vehicles (NGV) for the inspection and detection of delaminations in Types II, III and IV cylinders.",

Solar radiation measurements are carried out with balloons or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), which require rugged instruments that are small and lightweight.   However, current spectrometers capable of high spectral resolution covering a wide spectral range are bulky, heavy, sensitive to movement, and costly.  To address this problem, this project will develop a compact, monolithic (no moving part, solid optics) miniature 2-D spectrometer capable of high spectral resolution from the ultraviolet to the near infrared.  This unique performance will be achieved by stacking a large number of one-dimensional planar spectrometers to form a 2-D array.   In Phase I the 2-D spectrometer will be designed,  its performance analyzed, and the concept will be verified by experimental demonstrations.  Fabrication processes necessary to develop the 2-D device will be investigated, and its feasibility will be analyzed in terms of potential commercial applications. \n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   Commercial applications include miniature spectrometers for spectral analysis and sensor applications, for OEM as well as stand-alone instruments.

The proposed display is based on a unique combination of three technologies; (1) low-power light emitting diode (LED) arrays; (2) a polymer waveguide array substrate; and, (3) novel liquid crystal micro-optics.  POC's proposed display surpasses current miniature HMD displays in terms of size, power, resolution, and speed.  This is achieved by direct modulation of high-speed LED arrays to generate line images, and by parallel projection of light through a flexible polymer waveguide array sequentially scanned using either a refractive or diffractive liquid crystal output coupler array. Using the MHz speed of LEDs and time-multiplexing, the display will have increased grayscale capability, dynamic range, and dimming range.  Additionally, the device will be lightweight, rugged, and compact, and will require little power or maintenance.  With its high frame refresh rate and high resolution, POC's display will also reduce time-based and spatial image artifacts.  In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach by design and analysis, demonstration of component fabrication, and integration into a functional demonstration unit.  BENEFITS:  Because of its low power requirements, low cost, and high performance, the proposed display has many applications, including military head mounted displays (HMDs), space exploration, law enforcement, fire-fighting, education, training, maintenance and inventory-control, entertainment, portable computing and communications, and interactive virtual environments.",

        "abstract": "In this Phase I project, Physical Optics Corporation proposes a novel instrument for the in-situ monitoring of very thin layer film deposition.  The system makes use of imaging ellipsometry inside the reaction chamber to provide a spatially resolved measurement of the sample surface in the range of one second, thus enabling monitoring of film growth topography during the coating process.  Operating the system at the quasi-Brewster angle, close to the null-ellipsometer condition, gives enhanced sensitivity.  The use of several spectral bands for the measurement adds additional parameters to film thickness determination, providing a very precise readout, even at the monolayer level.  The monolayer imaging will be performed with about 10 micrometer lateral resolution over the entire surface of the substrate, leading to highly-resolved, fast information for judging the kinetics of surface coverage.  This device has commercial potential for optimization of coating processes, for surface investigations, and for sensing applications.  To date, most measurements of very thin layers either do not have the required sensitivity for single monolayers or are single-point measurements that require scanning.  Since it avoids these problems, the proposed apparatus will be superior for in-situ monitoring and for general sample characterization.  BENEFITS:  The proposed system will deliver fast, in-situ information about surface coverage and film deposition, opening a vast market in thin-film deposition systems.  The device can also be a supplement to Reactive Ion Etching chambers, as well as a potential standard tool for the large market of semiconductor or thin-film processing laboratories and plants.",

The proposed system will give aircraft maintainers and designers important quantitative information about corrosion kinetics.  The proposed system uses a corrosion sensitive fiber Bragg gratings, which can easily be embedded into structural members and lap joints, as sensing elements.  The fiber provides distributed sensing over the entire area covered by the fiber.  The fiber optic corrosion detection system will focus on the development of fiber Bragg grating sensors with aluminum metal coatings and the development of a novel demodulation method based on tapped fiber Bragg gratings.  The sensor can be used to detect the average state of corrosion at specific points along the fiber.  The tapped Bragg grating demodulator dispersively scatters light out of the optical fiber and is then imaged on to linear photodiode array.  In Phase I POC proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of using corrosion sensitive fiber Bragg gratings with the novel tapped Bragg grating demodulation system to detect the presence of aluminum corrosion.",

In contrast, Physical Optics Corporation proposes to develop and demonstrate a Highly Intelligent Remotely Programmable Alarm System (HIRPAS), setting a new standard of vehicle security in the year 2000, based on autonomous sensor fusion.  HIRPAS will be a hardware/software highly intelligent portable multisensor security system allowing real-time remote live-video oversight.  HIRPAS will improve security technology and surveillance mission efficiency. HIRPAS applies a unique combination of motion sensing with multisensor data fusion, neurofuzzy networks, and enhanced real-time MPEG-compatible compression for remote video transfer from the surveillance site.  Based on fuzzy metrology, HIRPAS will preprocess multisensor data, including video imagery, and will identify exceptional and significant events and preferentially downlink selected frame sequences in real-time through the processor in the vehicle and communicate with the person responsible for vehicle security.  This is made possible by intelligent integration among multiple heterogeneous sensors, pattern recognition in a neurofuzzy network, and unprecedented 4000:1 compression that only slightly reduces video quality, thus also dramatically increasing archiving capacity.",

The device can assist with evaluating the hydrodynamic merit of new submarine designs. A robust stress transducer uses a floating element, coupled with fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs), which is deflected when exposed to fluid flow. A transducer uses Bragg gratings etched onto a symmetrical pair of fibers. A pair of FBGs balances deflection of the floating element, thereby reducing noise caused by the temperature/pressure effect. Gaps within the exposure surface of the floating element are covered by a silicon rubber thin film to resist water contamination. In Phase I, proof-of-concept will be demonstrated for waterproofing techniques on a MEMS-based transducer.

This eye tracking system can be applied directly to a virtual reality training system to determine the image resolution requirement so as to adjust the VR processing speed.  In the proposed system, an invisible IR point source created by an optical fiber tip in front of the observer's eye creates a virtual image through Fresnel reflection from the cornea.  Eye movement causes the virtual image of the point source to move.  The IBEOS simply and rapidly determines the direction of the point virtual image of the light, and hence the orientation of the eye.  The system is optical, and therefore immune to EMI and RFI.  The BIEOS system is redundant, robust, and easily calibrated, so that it requires no operator training.  The use of fuzzy metrology minimizes the influence of stray ambient light.  The system can be installed in most environments (including vehicles) without modification.",

Caledonia, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG02-98ER82642\nAmount:  $74,968\n\nThe inhalation of fine particulate has recently been implicated in a number of health related problems.   In light of these new findings, changes are being proposed for the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter.  One major source that is likely to be affected by the new regulations is coal-fired power plants.  However, there is currently no method available to determine the quantity of fine particulate being emitted from these sources.\nThis project will develop an inexpensive, rugged device for monitoring PM2.5 particulate in process stack gases, particularly those of coal-fired utility boilers.  This device will utilize the principles of optical extinction and forward scattering to determine the particle size distributions and number density, and it will be non-intrusive to the exhaust flow.  Phase I will perform proof-of-concept measurements on PM2.5 particulate generated from an existing laboratory coal combustor and will develop a conceptual design of a prototype sensor system.  This data combined with computational modeling will lead to a preliminary prototype design.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  A device that is easy to operate, inexpensive, and easily retrofitted to exhaust stacks should dramatically lower the cost of compliance with new regulations.  This device should also be applicable to a wide range of combustion equipment and may be used as an ambient monitor._",

Potential contamination of more than 200 million cubic meters of soil and 600 billion gallons of ground water could result from subsurface plumes containing dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs), hazardous metals, and radionuclides.  This project will develop and demonstrate the Mobile Solar-Powered Destructive Adsorption Technology (DAT) system for in-situ treatment of DNAPLs.  The system will be self-contained, modular and low cost.  All process effluents will be benign and require no further treatment.  Laboratory experiments will be conducted on the use of high intensity solar radiation for thermally enhanced soil vapor extraction and on the application of destruction absorption technology (DAT) on chlorinated organic solvents, leading to a conceptual system design.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   Successful demonstration of the Mobile Solar-Powered DAT will lead to the development of a portable desorption unit which will be well suited for low cost clean up of volatile organic compound (VOL) contaminated soil, particularly in sites that are too remote or too small for large scale off-gas treatment.\n\n_",

The availability of rapid field screening for metals will speed site characterization by minimizing the number of samples requiring laboratory analysis.  The overall goal of this project is the development of a prototype field screening device for metals in soil based upon spark-induced spectroscopy (SIBS), which makes use of an electric spark to simultaneously atomize and excite metals atoms.  Following this excitation, the atomic emission is used to identify and quantitate the metals present in a sample.  Phase I of this project is the proof-of-principle that SIBS can be used to observe lead and chromium in a soil matrix.  It will explore matrix and co-contaminant effects upon the method, among other parameters.  At the end of Phase I, a preliminary design of the Phase II instrument will have been developed.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   The development of a simple, rugged and inexpensive field screening tool for metals will speed site characterization in the private sector as well as in DOE operations.\n_",

        "abstract": "The threat of military and terrorist deployment of chemical weapons has increased alarmingly in recent years. A universal decontamination system is required for safe and effective neutralization of standard and thickened chemical warfare agents (G, V, and H). The system must be non-toxic, non-corrosive, and non-hazardous to equipment and personnel. For effective implementation, the system must be stable, inexpensive, and easy to transport and deploy under field conditions. Current decontamination systems such as DS2 and supertropical bleach are toxic and corrosive. Physical Sciences, Inc. proposes to develop an inexpensive, stable, non-toxic, non-corrosive polymeric decontamination system for G, V, and H agents. The system will be formulated as a water-soluble dry powder to reduce logistical burdens. The system will be effective in either dry or aqueous (reconstituted) form, and will provide a colorimetric indication of the progress of the decontamination reaction. The system will be safe for use on a variety of material including medical decontamination of skin and wounds. In Phase I a prototype system will be formulated and used to demonstrate the rapid, effective decontamination of a material surface coated with standard and thickened agent simulants. A preliminary formulation of the Phase II decontamination system will be completed.",

        "abstract": "Rapid and accurate assessment of the toxicity of environmental contaminants and other hazardous species, including military-unique chemicals such as warfare agents, remains a significant challenge. Current methodologies are slow, expensive, and require sophisticated laboratory instrumentation.  Increasing concerns over the biological effects of common industrial chemicals such as solvents and hydrocarbon fuels, particularly in the context of assessing the overall toxicity of contaminated environmental areas such as waste sites, has motivated the need for rapid, accurate, and inexpensive toxicity tests which can be implemented in field environments.  Physical Sciences, Inc. (PSI) proposes to develop a simple, low-cost chemical microsensor-based toxicity test for rapid screening of hazardous species.  The toxicity test will utilize an array of sensors whose chemical specificity can be tuned by precise control of chemical composition, and which are self-transducing.  In Phase I the concept of developing a microsensor-based toxicity test will be demonstrated by the construction and testing of prototype toxicity test kits for chlorinated hydrocarbons and cholinesterase-inhibiting pesticides. The results will be used to design test kits for other classes of toxic species, which will be constructed and tested in Phase II.  BENEFITS:  The proposed toxicity tests will be rapid, low-cost, and easy to use in laboratory and field environments, offering significant cost and time savings over current technology.  Applications include toxicity screening of environmental pollutants and military-unique chemicals, determination of the overall toxicity of waste sites, and monitoring the progress and effectiveness of environmental clean-up and remediation efforts.",

The sensor will be built around the emerging technology in room temperature near-IR diode lasers, ultra-sensitive absorption detection technology, and state-of-the-art fiber coating technology which is hydrophobic and reversibly enriches C-c1 compounds for detection in the evanescent mode.  In this Phase I program we will demonstrate detection of two common solvents, 1, 2-dichloroethene (DCE) and 1,1,1 trichloroethene (TCE).  Detection of DCE and TCE will be conducted using two different light sources in the near-IR, a diode laser source and a tunable white light source.  The two systems will be evaluated for detection sensitivity, cost, power comsumption, size, lifetime, stability, and overall robustness for field applications.  Included in the Phase I proposal is a demonstration at the Armstrong Laboratory Environics Directorate.  During the Phase II program PSI will deliver an evanescent wave fiber optic sensor for the detection of chlorinated hydrocarbons.

The proposed method will build upon a large and evolving body of research which strongly implicates increased levels of nitric oxide (NO) as a respiratory marker for asthma.  The NO breath assay is attractive because its fast and virtually risk-free.  The ultimate goal is to develop and validate a method that is affordable and easy to use within typical MEPCOM (Military Entrance Processing  Command) centers.  The novel sensing technology proposed herein seeks to achieve a combination of affordability, sensitivity and simplicity not currently available from existing NO sensors.  The Phase I effort will focus on the development and laboratory testing of a new, thin film, polymer-based sensor, custom-formulated and designed to accurately measure down to parts per billion levels of exhaled nitric oxide in human breath.  In Phase II, prototype clinical instruments utilizing these sensors will be fabricated and delivered to designated clinical investigational site(s) for preliminary testing on human volunteers. The study objective would be to evaluate, in a population of active young adults, the ability of expired nitric oxide level to predict current and future asthma-related symptoms.  A non-invasive and unambiguous method for measuring airway inflammation has been a goal of asthma researchers for some time.  A method that is affordable and easy to perform would be of great value in both military and civilian healthcare settings.  Asthma is a serious chronic condition that affects over 10 million Americans and its prevalence is reportedly increasing in the military and civilian population.",

        "abstract": "In Phase I a system for structural hull vibration reduction using tunable vibration absorbers will be developed which can reduce the radiated noise of small underwater vehicles using minimum weight, volume and energy. This system will use minimal power for tuning control and monitoring in comparison to the use of active noise control. This is especially important for electrically powered UUVs which carry a limited energy supply. The basic concepts to be used for adaptively controlled frequency tunable resonators were demonstrated in part in an earlier program. This program will extend tunable vibration absorber capabilities to multi modal structures such as those in torpedo hulls. Practical tunable vibration absorber devices, sized for minimum volume and weight and capable of providing specified noise reduction performance will be designed and analyzed. We will evaluate and develop additions to current tuning strategies that assure that the absorber is tuned only to frequencies related to modes which radiate well. These will range from simple lookup tables based on reciprocity radiation efficiency tests, to onboard sensors including accelerometers and hull mounted acoustic intensity probes. Associated signal processing methods capable of determining the hull mode shapes and possibly their radiation efficiency will be developed as needed. Ultimately the use of towed arrays will be available for determining real time radiated noise.  The benefits of the adaptive tunable absorber system to be developed will be the capability to reduce low frequency range vibration and noise with minimum weight, small, low average power consumption devices. These devices will provide much better performance per unit weight for reducing tonal vibration than passive broadband treatments usually applied over extended areas. When combined with broad band treatments, total noise control system treatment weight can be reduced by tailoring the design of the broad band treatment to absorb the higher frequency vibration while using the tuned absorber to reduce low frequency noise. These devices will be used in applications which are sensitive to noise weight and power requirements including torpedos UUVs and advanced marine vehicles, amphibious and automotive vehicles, and manned and unmanned aircraft, particularly when variable speed operation is involved.",

        "abstract": "This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research proposal aims to develop a revolutionary single-mode optical sub-assembly (SMOSA), i.e. a laser or detector having external electrical connections and which has efficient optical coupling with a single-mode fiber. The proposed SMOSA is distinguished from existing single-mode technology in that it: 1) is based on vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs); 2) does not require the laser or detector to be activated for alignment (i.e. it is passively aligned); and 3) should have an overall cost which is drastically lower. Other advantages of the SMOSA are detailed in the proposal, which also distinguish it from existing technology. The Phase I program will first perform rigorous simulations to evaluate tolerances to translational and angular alignments and to beam, fiber and other imperfections. The simulations will be carried out for both transmit and receive ends of the fiber. Experiments will then be performed to evaluate the ability to package VCSELs and detectors within the tolerances using only passive alignment. Results of all these activities will be combined with other practical evaluations to determine the feasibility of manufacturing single-mode transceivers by the proposed method. Ruggedness and reliability tests will be performed in the Phase II development.",

Corrosion damage costs 4% of the U.S. Gross National Product each year.   In addition, corrosion has a deleterious effect on the environment and can often lead to catastrophic consequences.  The resistance to such corrosion is best achieved by the development of adherent stable alumina coatings.  Innovative plasma spray and reactive sputter deposition technologies will be used to produce tough adherent alumina coatings that exhibit improved elevated temperature oxidation and corrosion resistance.  Alumina coatings will be developed and subjected to high temperature corrosive environments to determine how composition, microstructure, and processing affects coating integrity.  More importantly, the use of innovative deposition techniques will allow microstructural manipulation that will lead to important insights regarding alumina adherence and performance.\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   Immediate commercialization should be realized for alumina-based thermal barrier coatings for turbine blades, combustor liners, stator vanes, etc.; aeronautical and land-based turbine engines; and pistons, valve heads, exhaust ports, and cylinders in diesel engines.  Other commercial applications include heat exchangers, burner nozzles, hot gas fans and filters, and pump and valve linings for corrosive environments.\n_",

However, beryllium forms performance limiting, brittle intermetallics with most metals, including all copper alloy heat sinks.  To prevent intermetallic formation the components must be operated at low temperatures or utilize multiple diffusion barrier coatings which add complexity and risk.  An aluminum-based heat sink would eliminate the brittle copper-beryllium intermetallic since aluminum is the only structural alloy that does not form an intermetallic with beryllium.  Beryllium brush armor will be fabricated and joined to aluminum alloy heat sinks to demonstrate an improved PFC.  Characterization of the lightweight aluminum beryllium materials and structure will be conducted.  Innovative beryllium brush armor will be developed and joined to aluminum heat sinks.  Beryllium armored aluminum PFC will be fabricated and delivered for fusion relevant high heat flux testing.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   These materials should be useful for fusion reactor plasma facing components, aircraft components, nuclear weapon components, lightweight mirrors and structures for space and satellite use, sporting equipment (golf clubs, rackets, etc.), and space station equipment._",

Several features of the Shocker+ are pending before the US Patent and Trademark Office. pVi has initiated development of a second generation pneumatic gun technology. Our electronically controlled and pneumatically actuated gun technology has several advantages over traditional paintball guns and nail guns. With the Shocker+ we have demonstrated the ability to consistently propel a projectile with a variety of propellant gases (C02, N2, and compressed air), at unusually low operating pressures (below 170 psig), at a repetition rate in excess of 10 Hz.  Our SBIR development plans include direct digital control, and development of a composite nail chamber loading subsystem. The current Shocker+ technology relies on hybrid digital/analog electronics. Our electronic control over the dynamics of the firing sequence allows us to apply virtually any pressure profile to a projectile, and allows us to gently accelerate a composite nail into dry fiber preforms using only the force required to achieve insertion without buckling the nail. Our gun can be driven by simple digital electronics for automated manufacturing applications.  BENEFITS:  This project will allow pVi to develop as an R&D firm to support needs.  pVi's will use the basic technology from this SBIR Phase I proposal to commercialize (1) a new nail gun for the defense and commercial composites joining market,  (2) a second generation paintball gun, and (3) a new nail gun to compete in the construction tool market, currently dominated by Japanese firms.",

        "abstract": "In spacecraft telemetry, expert systems technology is being used to manage the complexity generated by the greater number of complex measurands.  However, an uncontrolled proliferation of rules in an expert system can lead to maintenance, management and retrieval problems of the rulesets.  A semi-automated tool, such as Pragati's MVP-CA (Multi-ViewPoint Clustering Analysis) tool, can provide a valuable aid for comprehension, maintenance, integration and evolution of these expert systems by structuring a large knowledge base in various meaningful ways.  In this proposal, we seek to determine the feasibility of applying this technology to large, complex spacecraft mission expert systems so as to allow reliable software maintenance and management on them as well as study how these rule sets generated through the MVP-CA tool could be retrieved easily and efficiently through case-based reasoning techniques.  Our focus in this project will be to provide relevant information for retrieval maintenance and management of the rule stets through cluster interface definitions which in turn will form the bridge between the MVP-CA tool and case-based reasoning tools.  The latter will be used for rule set retrieval for reuse, maintenance and management of the telemetry expert systems.",

The inability to safely premix the fuel and air without damage from flashback or autoignition is impeding the advance of catalytic and non-catalytic low NOx combustion technology.  A solution to these problems would remove a hurdle in maintaining safe, durable operation of highly premixed combustors especially for these designs which involve premixing upstream of the flame stabilization region.  This project will develop a short, low pressure drop, integrated flashback arrestor/premixer for enabling safe, durable operation of highly premixed, low NOx ground power gas turbine engines.  The proposed concept offers a flashback arrestor that can be readily integrated into many existing premixer designs, thereby providing an enabling technology that can be useful in both new and retrofit applications.  In Phase I, proof of concept testing will be carried out with moderate pressure testing of a flashback arrestor design at ten atmospheres, with full pressure combustor rig testing to be carried out in Phase II.  \n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  In the electric power generation industry, there have been incidents in which flashback may have been related to gas turbine damage measured in millions of dollars.  Flashback arrestor technology might provide the solution to a major industry problem and prevent expensive machine damage and outage time. _",

Target goals are $4/kw and kw/kg respectively.  The design should also incorporate low part count for mass-producibility and contain an efficient cooling system.  This project will design a 100 kw motor with kw/kg power density that can meet the target cost goal.  It will meet the target goals by eliminating iron laminations in the motor and using optimally designed stators and rotors.  Design modifications will significantly reduce the cost.  The motor design will employ a unique stator configuration that can double the torque capacity compared to conventional motors of similar size.  Design drawings will be generated that will form the basis for fabrication and testing of a full-scale prototype 100 kw motor in Phase II.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Similar high power density motors can be used in locomotive generators, compressor and submarine drives, portable generators, and auxiliary power units. _",

Initially, system requirements need to be defined, functional procedures need to be established, an operational architecture needs to be developed, and a System Architecture needs to be realized. The PSI/MU Team proposes to develop a specification and a concept of operation for the Automated Tool Suite (ATS) which will take the various requirements of the Army's Operational Architecture and automate the synthesis of the system architecture. What makes this Automated Tool Suite (ATS) unique is its focus on offering the system architect designer a series of steps that guide the user through the complex process of developing the architecture. They include: (1) a user-friendly interface that includes an expert system which allows various architectural tradeoffs, (2) a series of supporting databases that help in rapidly defining system requirements in support of the operational requirements, (3) an expert system that interacts with high level parametric models that are used to provide the System Architect feedback about expected performance of proposed architectures, and (4) an analyst's back end that permits the viewing of the architecture from several views (e.g., hardware, communication and network, etc.) useful to an architect.

The key issue for this project is that the high-resolution imagery (for navigation) that needs to be processed in this project typically has a bandwidth of more than 5 times conventional real-time.  Our proposed innovative techniques include: parallel pipeline image processing, and biologically motivated multi-resolution and region-of-interest image processing for image registration, as well as biologically motivated user controllable color coding.  The proposed image fusion algorithms and hardware system will be robust and can function properly in the presence of image mismatches or misalignment, especially 5 to 10 pixel displacement mismatches, as specified by the Army.  PES has extensive experience in developing image processing systems on low cost commercial off the shelf (COTS) hardware platforms and will implement the entire proposed image fusion system in low cost COTS hardware (PCI image processing boards in Pentium PC).

        "abstract": "Programmable high speed, large format Charge Coupled devices (CCDs) have numerous applications in image processing, surveillance, and reconnaissance applications. Such devices are also valuable tools in medical imaging and high speed event analysis. Motion or change detection is of definite interest in security applications, and high speed inspection is a priority in assembly lines and in evaluating surveillance imagery. Ideally, such cameras would also allow the user to trade-off speed for spatial resolution. One specific application of particular interest to the U.S. Army Missile Command is optical correlator systems. The proposed programmable high speed CCD camera would be employed in the optical correlator system as the input detector and or the correlation plane detector. The overall goal is the development of a programmable 1024 x 1024 pixel CCD camera system, including on-board frame subtraction, capable of at least 200 frames per second framing rates for application in optical correlators and other fast imaging applications. The Phase I objective is to demonstrate real time frame subtraction and the tradeoff between speed and spatial resolution by binning pixels in the CCD during readout. A further Phase I objective is to carry out the conceptual design of a camera system that would be designed and built in Phase II.  BENEFITS:  Programmable, high spatial resolution, fast framing digital cameras have broad commercial and military applkation, including motion analysis, surveillance, and medical imaging and optical data processing and computing",

The technology has been successfully applied to synthetic non-oily graywater effluent and should meet all regulatory standards for discharge. The technology should also be applicable to blackwater applications.  It consists of three elements: innovative fluid dynamics, specific cleaning chemistry and efficient cleaning protocol.  Emphasis is placed on removal of biofilm from the membrane surface as well as cleaning of the membrane pores. This proprietary technology completely removes biofilm and other foulants from membrane surfaces and reduces the cleaning time by a factor of 10 when compared with standard methods.  Our design should interface with ultrafiltration treatment  equipment on Naval ships without modification. PTT\u00c2\u00bfs cleaning chemistry is environmentally-safe and effective. Our  development team includes Professor Audrey Levine of Utah State; she will direct efforts related to the gray/black water composition and assist in foulants characterization. Phase II will involve designing and building a prototype to incorporate into wastewater treatment systems on Navy ships. A complete marketing plan has been prepared for Navy and civilian applications. PTT\u00c2\u00bfs cleaning technology includes the cleaning of the lumen and pore of the tubular membrane.",

Great care has been taken to establish a sound process for Integration and Test of the submarine system.

After the SDCT period,   problems will undoubtedly be uncovered during the T&I periods at the  COATS and on the platform that will require find, fix and retest (FFR) efforts.   These FFR periods represent biggest challenge for the C3I system in that the  amount of retesting (i.e., regression testing) required has a significant impact  on the overall T&I period.

Using a multi-disciplinary approach, we will construct and evaluate a non-toxic form of botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) for use as a neural cell specific delivery vehicle. In Phase I, we will set out to accomplish: 1) Construct of BoNT-derived delivery vehicles coupled to a reporter molecule. 2) Evaluate the delivery capabilities of the BoNT-derived vehicles. 3). Determine the minimal components of BoNT for successful drug delivery. In Phase II, we will:  synthesize aminoquinoline derivatives that can be coupled to the delivery vehicle and increase the number of BoNT delivery vehicle delivery drug binding sites. The work proposed here is intended to lead to systems which will function as important pharmacological delivery systems in antitoxin therapy and possibly serve in targeting therapeutic agents to nerve terminals for a variety of disease states.  BENEFITS:  These drug delivery vehicles have potential as antitoxin therapeutics under battle field conditions.

The liquid fuels used in these engines must, therefore, have a good  heat-of-combustion, and provide the necessary heat sink for an active cooling system. This program  seeks to design, fabricate, and test the performance of a high temperature, high speed, liquid fuel  control valve to Government performance requirements. In the valve approach proposed, the control  of fuel flow rate is achieved by varying pintle tip axial position relative to a fixed orifice which in turn  varies the flow area of the valve. Phase I will involve the design, fabrication, and testing of a prototype  valve based on established high-performance Government requirements. Phase II will carry-out  minimum size construction of both the fuel valve and its control electronics. A limited production run  of five units will be fabricated, and multiple tests will be accomplished to document valve performance  throughout the lot. Various duty cycles, source pressures, fuels, and fuel temperatures will be used to  document valve pressure drop, fuel flow capacity, and flow linearity with pintle position.",

        "abstract": "Currently, the majority of decision-support systems assume normative performance and fail to adapt to individual differences.  This is particularly true with respect to affective states and individual beliefs, which can have profound impact on performance, particularly in complex, crisis situations.  We propose to develop an Affect and Belief Adaptive Interface System (ABAIS) capable of compensating for performance biases caused by users' affective states and active beliefs.  The ABAIS architecture implements an adaptive methodology consisting of four steps:  sensing/inferring user affective state and performance-relevant beliefs; identifying their potential impact on performance; selecting a compensatory strategy; and implementing this strategy in terms of specific GUI adaptations.  ABAIS provides a generic adaptive framework for exploring a variety of user state assessment methods (e.g., knowledge-based, self-reports, diagnositc tasks, physiological sensing), and GUI adaptation strategies (e.g., content- and format-based).  The ABAIS performance bias prediction is based on existing empirical findings from emotion research and knowledge of specific task requirements.  We propose to develop ABAIS using COTS software and an existing decision-support pilot-aiding system GUI, and demonstrate its functionality in the context of an Air Force combat ask, which is particularly susceptible to anxiety-induced biases.",

        "abstract": "Earth penetrators are now extremely effective in passing through layers of earth, sand, concrete, and reinforced material to reach hard targets.  The penetrating munitions would be even more effective against hardened targets such as underground bunkers if the high explosive charge could be detonated at the optimum location inside the bunker.  We propose to develop and test a simple electromagnetic (EM) sensor to control detonation of the high explosive charge.  The EM sensor will measure the local dielectric constant (er ) of the surrounding material using a resonant antenna.  For said, soil, concrete, and other terrestrial and construction materials, er is much higher than for air so detection of voids will be robust.  In addition, the EM sensor will give an analog output signal which allows identification of various media types.  An oscillator circuit generates RF energy which is radiated by the antenna.  Variations in er modify the antenna resonant frequency, pulling the oscillator frequency or causing variations in reflected power which are measured as the sensor output.  Proof of concept experiments will be performed with a realistic electronic package in a model penetrator body.",

        "abstract": "Powerful ultra-wideband impulse sources are currently developed for application to high resolution impulse radar, material penetrating radar, susceptibility testing, ECM, high power jammers, and covert communications.  One approach to radiating the narrow impulses uses laser controlled photoconductive solid state switching (PCSS) to coherently drive arrays of multiple radiating antennas.  Because the laser controlled switches can be triggered with low jitter, this modular approach allows efficient beam forming and steering.For some applications alternative low jitter triggered switches which are small, inexpensive, and have very long lifetimes are needed.  For example, a compact array powered by miniature synchronized pulsers could be used for ground surveillance radar, as a covert communications link, and also as a convenient source for RCS measurements and antenna calibration.  We will develop a solid-state switched array impulse source for these applications.The solid-state switched array impulse sources could also be used as lightweight impulse radar transmitters for airborne radar systems for detecting and identifying surface or sub-surface UXO and land mines and for military target discrimination at long range.  The triggered solid-state switches could be used directly as Pockels cell drivers, laser drivers, and for laboratory pulse generators.",

As processors continue to increase in speed and complexity, the need for a high speed data link will become acute.  The proposed transceiver will simultaneously transmit 256 channels of data while it receives 256 channels of data. The combined data rate exceeds 5 Terabit/second.

        "abstract": "Q-DOT proposes to develop an innovative digital beamformer suitable for satellite payloads for the Air Force.  Based on bandpass delta-sigma data conversion technology, wideband radio frequency (RF) signals are sampled at a high intermediate frequency (IF) within a transmit/receive (T/R) module.  Digital beamforming is performed directly on the one-bit delta-sigma data output from the T/R module thus saving significant size and power over competing digital beamformer architectures.  Multi-beam applications are also supported.  The high-speed requirements of the delta-sigma modulator and large scale integration of the digital signal processing will be met with custom integrated circuit (IC) design on an advanced SiGe HBT/CMOS process. Q-DOT is on the cutting edge of high-speed delta-sigma modulator IC development for digital beamformers in radar, communications, ultrasound, and sonar applications.During Phase I system specifications will be determined for the satellite digital beamformer.  Preliminary topologies for the T/R module and beamformer will be investigated.  A testbed architecture will also be developed.  During Phase II, a prototype digital beamformer and/or test-bed will be built targeting specific governement and commercial applications.  Substantial interest expressed in the proposed RF delta=sigma beamformer by government and commercial customers promises rapid deployment of Phase III products.",

The environment will build upon Qualtech Systems\u00c2\u00bf (QSI) multi-signal modeling methodology that forms the core in a suite of commercial tools presently used for fault modeling, maintenance and troubleshooting of complex systems.  The proposed effort will be conducted in consultation with Aptima, Inc., an industry leader in Human Engineering.  In Phase I, the issues in extending the reliability analysis and FMECA techniques, already implemented in TEAMS, to systems of systems will be investigated.  We will also focus on enhancements to the GUI in QSI\u00c2\u00bfs tools, TEAMS, and to its underlying multi-signal modeling methodology for developing a visualization tool for failure analysis (TEAMS-FA).  A joint task force military mission will be used as an example scenario to test the utility of the developed technologies.  In Phase II, TEAMS-FA development will be completed and the tool integrated with behavioral simulators for automatic multi-signal model extraction.  The capability to integrate with QSI\u00c2\u00bfs diagnostic tools for post-deployment support will be a welcome by-product.",

        "abstract": "Low-temperature MBE grown GaAs (LT-GaAs) contains a high concentration of excess As which gives rise to ultra-fast carrier-trapping time and excellent radiation hardness.  In as-grown layers most of this excess As is in the form of As(Ga) antisite defects, of which only ~1% are ionized.  Thermal annealing upon overgrowth with a device structure or during device processing results in a decrease of the As(Ga) concentration by about a factor of 100, accompanied by out-diffusion of excess As into adjacent layers.  The benefits of LT-GaAs buffer layers for device isolation and increased radiation hardness can thus be realized only if their stability can be improved.  Doping the LT-GaAs layers with Be (LT-GaAs:Be) can thermally-stabilize As(Ga) antisite defects and increases their incorporation.  However, Be is known to be a relatively mobile element at high temperatures and LT-GaAs:Be may suffer from undesirable concentration-dependent diffusion at high doping levels.  Here, we propose the use of C as an alternative p-type dopant in LT-GaAs.  The combination of larger lattice concentration and superior thermal stability should make LT:GaAs:C a promising technology for radiation-hard field effect transistor (FET) applications.  The proposed technology will offer enhancement in radiation hardness, thermal stability and reliability of III-V semiconductor-based field effect transistors compared to conventional undoped and Be-doped low-temperature buffers.",

        "abstract": "Fiber-reinforced composites are lightweight, high-performance materials that play a critical role in the design of space structures, surface launched interceptors and other ground and space based systems. Quality control in-service and during fabrication is of paramount importance to maximizing the capability of advanced composites and to increase cost effectiveness. What is needed is a non-destructive evaluation (NDE) method to easily monitor the condition of the composite during its entire lifetime, preferably with embedded sensors which must not perturb the properties of the composite.  Quantum Magnetics is proposing a novel nondestructive strain sensor for this application. By measuring internal and surface strains, flaws in the composite structure can be detected at their onset. Early flaw detection will prevent catastrophic failures, costly repairs and serve as quality control during fabrication. No external stress needs to be applied to the tested structure. The proposed strain gage is based on the principle of Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance (NQR). 1-5wt% of crystalline additives is blended into the resin during fabrication of the composite structure. For testing, the composite is irradiated with radio frequencies to evoke an NQR response from the embedded crystals, which is a linear function of strain.",

        "abstract": "Approximately 12 months ago a new amplification effect of over 30 dB was obtained in, DC Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID). The amplification is based on measuring the circulating current in the SQUID, instead of the induced voltage, which is the present practice. To achieve the high gain the SQUID must be biased into a regime in which in switches between internal flux states under the effect of thermal noise.  A new high frequency amplifier is proposed that exploits this enhanced amplification effect. Based on the observed behavior of the switching state in the SQUID and the known characteristics of DC SQUIDs, a gain > 30 dB over a bandwidth potentially exceeding 50 GHz at a noise temperature of order 1 K may be possible for an optimized device. This performance exceeds that achieved in semiconductor technology for all three parameters.  In Phase I we will draw up a mathematical model for the complete amplifier system including input coupling and output post amplification. Numerical simulations will be performed to predict the amplifier performance as a function of frequency. We will consider fabrication issues for implementation in low Tc and high Tc technology. The commercial potential for the amplifier will be assessed by considering a specific communications or instrumentation subsystem as a case study.",

        "abstract": "QRC submits this proposal in response to SBIR AF98-286 for a Plane Wave generator.  The plane wave generator is required to generate a free space RF wave installed in the Benefield Anechoic Facility (BAF) to evaluate the various electromagnetic systems installed on the aircraft systems such as the B1B, F16, and C17.  The generator must cover a wide frequency band in order to test the many different radiating systems on aircraft today. In addition, the generator requires polarization agility, so the polarization of the system on the aircraft and the generator match.  The generator input power must be at least 100W and should be capable of detecting any desired signal.  This generator must be mobile enough to place at various locations within the chamber or even removed when not in use. Beam steering allows the generator to cover a wider range of the chamber without the generator.  The generator must have a low RCS, so scattering does not interfere with any test. A coporate feed is proposed.  Amplitude and phase control of the signals allows the array to place the desired plane wave at various angles and distances within the chamber.  Design variables of the array include the number of elements, phase and amplitude weighting at the elements, and location of the elements.  This design does not preclude aperiodic array designs.  We propose designing a planar phased array that can steer and focus the plane wave via phase and amplitude weighting of the signals at the elements.  Our appoach uses a genetic algorithm to optimize the antenna design.  Genetic algorithms are computer algorithms that optimize complex problems by modeling natural selection and genetics.  These algorithms are superior to conventional methods because they can optimize a large number of parameters over a very complex output.  One important characteristic of the plane wave is the depth of field or quiet zone.  Although not listed as one of the technical requirements, the depth of field may prove to be an important design parameter and can be calculated easily using the proposed computer model.  The depth of field is a parameter that can be modified by appropriate phase and amplitude tapers on the array.",

Critical to achieving a common radar is developing a common antenna.  To this end, the goal of this Phase I study is to develop a single, common low-cost and lightweight Electronically Scanned Antenna (ESA) that can be employed for all SOF fixed, rotary wing, and tilt-rotor aircraft.  Performance benefits include rapid beam scanning, beam agility, the performance of multiple functions such as TF/TA navigation and weather detection, commonality amongst SOF aircraft, reduced support costs, and increased reliability.  Typically these gains are obtained at the expense of large increases in overall system cost and weight when employed a classical ESA architecture consisting of discrete elements, such as T/R modules. Radant Technologies has developed a novel approach to electronic beam steering that is predicted to meet the low cost, lightweight, and technical requirements of the SOF Common Radar.  This approach, the Radant Lens ESA, employs bulk phase shifting to avoid using discrete elements behind each element and hence is intrinsically lightweight and low-cost.",

The guided wave optical backplane employed is a ~mm thick waveguiding plate in conjunction with multiplexed volume holograms based on photopolymeric materials. Two-dimensionally ( 2D) pixelated signals can be bidirectionally transmitted and received using the third dimension. As a result, the highest interconnectivity can be realized while maintaining the TEMoo optical signal mode profile which significantly simplifies the system packaging. The system insertion loss is therefore greatly reduced. The idea presented herein is a truly bidirectional optical backplane bus with broadcast capability that is equivalent to EEE standardized bus protocols for VMEbus, Futurebus+ and FASTBUS.

Innovative is its use of a single-mode polymer waveguide with a controllable amount of birefringence, via the electro-optic effect, to adjust the polarization state of a laser beam.  It has a very small mass, low power consumption, and very compact size.  Other desirable attributes are its use of no moving parts, no expensive birefringent crystals (e.g., calcite), low voltages (~10 V), and a single high-speed driving-voltage source.  Furthermore, it can operate at arbitrary speeds up to 101s of GHz and has an adjustable wavelength of operation (i.e., 700-1600 nm).  The innovation will form the central portion of sensors for detecting chirality.  A signature of chirality is natural optical activity, where light passing through chiral materials exhibits circular dichroism and optical rotatory dispersion.  Related effects can also occur in reflected light, where for instance the magnitude of the reflectivity can be different for LHC and RHC light.  Most biological material is chiral.  Thus the proposed modulator would aid in target recognition, since a remote sensor based upon it would be able to discern biological materials from typically achiral man-made materials used in camouflage.  Key to detecting chirality is a source of both LHC and RHC light of high purity, which the proposed innovation provides.",

Th application of the wavelength-division-multiplexing technique makes the formation of a twin-beam phased array an easy task without increasing the payload of an airborne or spaceborne platform.By the end of Phase I, we will demonstrate all the after mentioned unique features to build a solid cornerstone for the success of the Phase II program.",

        "abstract": "New developments in the three-dimensional memory devices have created demand for high-speed and large-volume data handling interconnects between memory devices and processing elements.  Electrical interconnects fail to keep up with this new demand due to their basic limitations.  Optical interconnects and devices inherently offer large bandwidth and hence high-speed and ultra-high-density data capacities.     Radiant Research, Inc., proposes to construct a parallel-to-serial interconnect module using guided-wave technology in conjunction with VCSELs, Photodiodes, wavelength division demultiplexing (WDDM) device and multimode fibers.  Employment of the WDDM device significantly increases the aggregate bandwidth well above 10 Gb/sec, while minimizing the latency of data transfer.  Inherently parallel memory using serial optical network can be realized without compromising the performance.  3D-holographic memory system provided by Holoplex (HM-100) will be employed for the system demonstration.  Experimental result shows that each WDDM wavelength channel can provide 2500 Gb/sec in a parallel-to-serial format.  As a result, the projected target (Fig.2) will be achieved.  Important benefits of this approach are significantly improved device performance in the context of data transfer for 3D memory, relaxed fabrication tolerance, and reduced cost.  The proposed technology has tremendous commercial value in the optoelectronic interconnect industry.",

Baldwin, Principal Investigator\nDr. Ronald M. Baldwin, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG02-98ER82653\nAmount:  $74,973\n\nChanges in the dopamine transporter are involved in important neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson\u00c2\u00bfs Disease and substance abuse.  Radionuclide imaging of the dopamine transporter can measure neuronal loss noninvasively, as demonstrated by radiotracers labeled with the cyclotron-produced radionuclide iodine-123.  Radiopharmaceuticals labeled with technetium-99m (Tc-99m) would be more practical for clinical application and commercial development because of the lower cost and readier availability of Tc-99m.  The goal of this project is to develop a Tc-99m-labeled radiotracer for imaging the dopamine transporter with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).  The working hypothesis is that attaching a suitable substituted phenyltropane with an indenyl- or cyclopentadienyltricarbonyl metal complex will give a tracer with a high affinity and low nonspecific binding.  This project will test proof of principle by synthesizing representative rhenium complexes and measuring in vitro binding and lipophilicity.  Candidates with the highest affinity will be labeled with Tc-99m and the specific dopamine transporter binding of the radiolabeled complex will be measured.  Phase II studies will follow up with in vivo binding by SPECT imaging of the Tc-99m complexes, developing labeling methods for a \u00c2\u00bfkit\u00c2\u00bf product, and extending the structure-activity relationships.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The commercial availability of a Tc-99m SPECT agent for imaging of dopamine transporters will find wide application in Parkinson\u00c2\u00bfs disease to diagnose patients at risk, to monitor progression of the disease, and to advance the development of effective preventive, palliative, and therapeutic treatments._",

The transponder architecture consists of flexible, digital processing components to perform all required signal processing operations.The ADMBT architecture receives satellite channels using a multiple antenna array and downconverts the channels to intermediate frequencies for high-rate, wide bandwidth digitization.  The digitized data is channelized to a comon bandwidth and then partial bandwidth synthesized to the bandwidths needed for each of the signals-of-interest across multiple antennas.  The SOI antenna vectors are then independently processed using either fixed or adaptive beamforming algorithms to produce the desired baseband  SOIs.  Post-beamforming, an on-board baseband processor is available to retune, reformat, or restructure the incoming SOIs for retransmission.  The output SOIs are spatially beamformed for transmission using a-priori, conjugate, or otimal retro-directive beamforming weights.  The multi-antenna spatial SOI data is then partial bandwidth channelized, combined with other overlapping and non-overlapping SOI cells, and synthesized into appropriate digital IF channels. To complete the process, the wide bandwidth digital IF channels are converted to analog, upconverted to the transmission frequency, and amplified for transmission.",

Several hundred congeners, together with physical weathering and microbial dechlorination and oxication, add to the complexity of PCB mixtures found inthe environment.  PCBs are hydrophobic and associate with soil, whether wet or dry.  Excavation is disruptive and often leads to dispersion of fine particles carrying contaminants.  Physical separation can concentrate but not destroy PCBs; further, separation is not a viable in-situ process.  Purely anaerobic biodegradation is improbable; aerobic dechlorination, followed by mineralization, is possible but undemontrated.  Destruction via fungal metabolism has been proposed but has not been demonstrated at full -scale.TWO-STEP MICROBIAL DEGRADATION, ANAEROBIC DECHLORINATION FOLLOWED BY OXIDATION, IS PROPOSED FOR IN-SITU REMEDIATION.  Highly chlorinated congeners, i.e., three or more chlorine atoms on Biphenyl, are dechlorinated in place under anaerobic conditions.  This process is site specific and requires injection of deaerated water amended with electron acceptor (nitrate), nutrients (if not present in adequate concentration) and a supplementary carbon source.  Biodegradation is based on microbial communities present at the site.  Dichlor-, monochlor- and base Biphenyl are mineralized microbially via oxidation in a subsequent aerobic process.

The goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of reducing red cell oxygen partial pressures to below 2 mmHg and maintaining the oxygen partial pressure at or below this level during long-term storage.  Oxygenator hollow fiber membrane material will be used in a de-oxygenator designed, fabricated, and optimized for this project.  A prototype of the overall system will be constructed and tested.  The feasibility and future practicality, simplicity, ease-of-use, consistent performance, and low cost for military and commercial blood bank use will be evaluated and demonstrated.  BENEFITS:  The benefits of longer red cell storage periods include logistical benefits to the military, greater flexibility and reduced waste in the storage and use of red cells by commercial blood banks, and improved red cell quality.  The lengthened storage of red cells for potential combat or blood bank use result in significantly less overall outdating and discarding of red cells.",

        "abstract": "The long-term objective of this research is the development of a closed, sterile, fully automated system for thawing and washing red blood cells that have been frozen with the polymeric cryoprotectant hydroxyethyl starch (HES). The only currently available method for freezing red cells utilizes glycerol at high concentration. Since glycerol penetrates red cells, removing it following thawing creates osmotic stresses that can hemolyse cells, several successive wash solutions of decreasing osmolality are necessary and more than 30 minutes of relatively skilled technician time are required. The HES system has the advantage that HES does not penetrate the red cells and can be rapidly removed using a single wash solution without producing osmotic stresses.  The system proposed will achieve washing by means of a hollow fibre fluid exchange device that achieves the wash without the disadvantages of moving parts and high disposable costs. We further propose to explore the feasibility of automated thawing between heated plates with the washing proceeding concurrently with thawing. Post-wash storage will be optimized to provide maximum refrigerated shelf-life consistent with established guidelines for free hemoglobin and in vivo survival.  The proposed research will evaluate the feasibility of this approach by fabricating and testing disposable sets and the automated apparatus necessary to implement the process. The quality and clinical acceptability of red cells processed with this apparatus will be evaluated.  This system provides red cells that can be stored indefinitely in the frozen state and rapidly thawed and washed for transfusion.  A frozen red cell system with a less inexpensive, more rapid, fully automated reconstitution system is attractive for isolated locations and for uses such as the storage of autologous blood and rare blood types.",

        "abstract": "Future Airborne ASW tactics will depend heavily upon the use of active sonar and bistatics with a distributed field of sonobuoys as the primary means of initial target detection and localization. However, the bistatic detection and classification problem is compounded by short contact times, evasive target maneuvers, and the ambiguous nature of target echoes and clutter. Recent studies indicate that some target signals are potentially exploitable by passive detection, even in the acoustic and tactical environments of interest for active search. A method of detecting these signals, and a method of incorporating the clues provided by such detections, is desired to augment the information obtained from the processing of the active sonar data.  A system level approach to achieving this passive signal detection, and implementing the techniques in an Air ASW active search mission is proposed.The proposed techniques will demonstrate that the passive detection methods are useful, and that they provide added value to current and future active search based Air ASW missions.",

In future multi-static, multi-receiver search missions, the number of alerts is expected to increase dramatically. An operator will simply not have the time to manually analyze and classify all the target and clutter returns without an algorithm to assist him. The goal of this SBIR effort is to develop environmentally robust algorithms that significantly increase detection and the ability to discriminate target returns from clutter, and ultimately reduce the operator workload.  Many past efforts have been all-or-nothing ventures. Either the operator does it all by himself, or the algorithm completely replaces him in his effort, or at best has no interaction with him. A major problem with previous automated systems is that when the classifiers are exposed to a new and unknown environment, they suffer a drastic performance degradation.  The effort proposed here will capitalize on information extracted in situ from initial insonification of the search area. Techniques are proposed to identify those echo return features which best exploit the current mission operating environment. Operator tools are proposed which keep him in the loop, reduce classification workload, and allow him to process large amounts of detections simultaneously.",

        "abstract": "The high air velocity and relatively low air temperature in the combustors of hydrocarbon-fueled scramjet engines lead to long ignition delays, and problems with flame holding, combustion stability and heat release.  These problems are particularly severe near the ram/scram mode transition.  High internal air velocities and long ignition delays can require long combustor lengths to allow heat release from the fuel before it passes into the exhaust nozzle.  Excessive combustor lengths and large flameholding recirculation zones cause large fuel heat loads and internal total pressure losses, hurting cycle performance and limiting the maximum flight speed.  Use of a combustion initiator to improve the reactivity of the fuel and shorten the ignition delay could allow the combustor to be shortened and eliminate the draggy flameholding recirculation zones.  This would substantially improve overall cycle performance, decrease the heat loads imposed on the fuel, decrease engine weight, and allow higher flight speeds.  Metering of the initiator compound into the fuel could also allow control over the heat release profile within the engine.",

        "abstract": "The U.S. Air Force has identified a need for advanced protective coating systems for its aging aircraft.  Durable (30+years) chromate-free coatings are needed to extend the retirement dates of the aging aircraft.  A chromate-free coating is needed to avoid the costs of handling of chromate containing hazardous wastes.   Unfortunately, in a recent study of chromate-free conversion coatings, all the tested coatings failed to meet the necessary coating requirements (i.e. MilC-81706 Class 1A).  According to a Blue Ribbon Advisory Panel assembled by the U.S. Air Force, current coating materials are not likely to meet provide the required 30+ year chromate-free coating.In Phase I we will develop a chromate-free coupling layer for aluminum substrates that will form the first layer of an integrated chromate-free 30+ year protective coating system.  We will prepare a multifunctional coupling layer that provides strong covalent bonds between the aluminum alloys and the epoxy primer and in addition also provides excellent corrosion resistance.  The phase I efforts will provide basis for a Phase II project where an integrated advanced coating system will be developed.",

        "abstract": "Naval transports and ordinance are currently coated to prevent corrosion and other destructive weathering phenomena.  These coatings have a limited life-span as adhesion is compromised when they degrade on exposure to light, moisture, abrasive wind and wear.  Special properties necessary for naval coatings include non-skid characteristics, corrosion and fire resistance, high mechanical strength and chemical stability.   Current non-skid urethane coatings have high flammability and poor life-cycle performance.  TDA Research Inc. (TDA) has developed a tough, corrosion resistant hybrid organic/inorganic urethane coating that is expected to have excellent non-skid and fire retardant characteristics.   The coating can be applied to a variety of substrates, including aluminum, steel, fiberglass and wood, by existing technologies.  This chemically resistant nanocomposite coating is anticipated to have excellent long-term physical properties leading to reduced maintenance costs.  In Phase I, we will prepare the hybrid polymer and examine the coatings applied to several substrates.  Properties will be optimized by choosing the appropriate nanocomposite and formulation.  Samples will be provided to the Navy for testing.  In Phase II, TDA will collaborate with a major coatings producer to prepare 100lb quantities of resin and conduct market testing.  Commercial applications include walkways, ship and pool decks, a $50 million dollar market.",

        "abstract": "Aircraft designed for hypersonic flight use fuel to cool the ramjet/scramjet propulsion system.   Sensible heating and endothermic reactions are used to provide cooling and may produce fuel temperatures that exceed 1200 degrees F.  At these temperatures carbonaceous deposits (coke) form.  These deposits can inhibit fuel flow, reduce heat transfer, and create hot spots.  Coke deposits are known to form by three different mechanisms:  1) An oxidative mechanism involving dissolved oxygen, 2) a reaction between the fuel and metals in the flow path walls that produces carbon filaments, and 3) A gas phase mechanism in which high molecular weight hydrocarbons are formed from the products of thermal cracking reactions (condensation mechanism). Although methods are currently available for controlling the first two coke formation pathways, a means to control the third mechanism is needed.Thus, the objective of the proposed work is to identiy compounds that can be added to the fuel to inhibit the coke formed by the condensation mechanism.  In Phase I, TDA will add candidate suppressants to fuel and measure their effect on coke deposition rates.",

The proposed work investigates the use of two reduction strategies, namely reduced mechanism methods and low dimensional manifold methods.  These particular methods were chosen due to their current state of development and degree of automation.  The research involves the development of reduced descriptions of the detailed chemistry using both approaches along with work to validate the proposed reductions.  Physical properties of importance are pollutant formation (NOx and soot), major species concentrations, radical concentrations, temperatuare, and ignition delay.  Feasibility of both approaches will be determined and the best approach selected for implementation in Phase II.  Near the completion of the Phase I work, techniques for tabulation of the reduced chemistry will be investigated.",

This project will develop alternative technology which builds on experience with metal lined or metal embedded ceramic matrix composite (CMC) cooled structures developed for high heat flux applications in rocket engines (in which the thermal loads are very similar to those in fusion reactors).  A helium cooled CMC system with radiation tolerant metallic sealants and interface coating systems will be developed and demonstrated.

RCI proposes to extend this technology to Refeneratively Cooded C/SiC composites for rocket engine hot section components such as combusters and nozzles.  In order to contain the high combustion pressures, 2500 psi and higher, in high performance engines, RCI will develop a hybrid composite material system having high strength and low gas permeabilities.  The regeneratively cooled ceramic composite operating at hot surface temperatures greter than 2500 degrees F has large pay-offs as a result of a significant weight reductions due to decreases in component mass and descreased wet fraction associated with higher operating temperatures.  Furthermore, with wall temperatures of 2500 degrees F for C/SiC as opposed to 800 degrees F, there is a reduction in total hydrogen cooling mass required per unit time, thus reduced turbo pump engine cycle losses.  The primary goal of the Phase I program will be to demonstrate the technical and economic feasibility of regeneratively cooled C/SiC body of revolution rocket components operating at combustion pressures above 2500 psi.  In Phase I material and thrust chamber testing will be performed.  Pratt & Whitney will assist in materials characterization, component design and, during the Phase II program, larger scale component testing.",

To counter identified threats, the contractor proposes to perform a vulnerability analysis using patterns of system architectures to identify weaknesses.  Then, effective recovery methods will be mapped to the threat using game theory so that a time ordered sequence of events can be planned as the attack unfolds.  Finally, a spreadsheet-like tool will be prepared to demonstrate the feasibility of using the approach to counter threats to critical systems that have damaging effects.  The contactor will also conduct a market survey and examine the potential commercial market for products and services that can be generated using the detection and recovery methodology during Phase II should the feasibility demo be successful.",

        "abstract": "The prediction of the performance of radio communication channels in complex environments is a challenging problem for computational electromagnetics.  The geometries involved are very complicated in. shape.  They are also very large, so that large amounts of data are needed to describe the buildings, terrain, and other features to be included in the calculations.  Developments that have occurred over the past decade, and to a greater extent over the past few years, now provide the tools needed for accurate prediction of the performance of these communication channels.  These developments include more accurate terrain data bases, quick availability of urban feature information, advances in computational electromagnetics, and faster computers with large memory.  Utilizing these advances, it has been demonstrated that deterministic, site-specific prediction of radio signal propagation in complex environments is possible.  The next step is to take this capability from a research tool to a user-friendly software environment to be applied in realistic situations by non-experts.  BENEFITS:  Commercial software for the accurate prediction of radio communication channel propagation would be useful to companies desiring to site communication systems and to DOD agencies interested in reliable radio communications, especially in situations where preliminary measurements are not possible.",

With declining military budgets and increased requirements, technology offers a cost-effective means of providing timely, accurate, team assessment feedback.  The Internet offers world-wide access to this technology.  Developing quality distributed Internet-based, team assessment technology requires integration of several technologies: research on team performance, state-of-the-art performance assessment, and Internet-based delivery systems.  Research Development Corporation and subcontractor LNK Corporation propose to develop team assessment technology that integrates and enhances existing technologies.  These include automated performance assessment technology developed under contract to Armstrong Labs, distributed intelligent tutoring system technology for measuring shared mental models of teams, and Internet delivery technology.  The heart of our approach is RDC's validated assessment model that is currently being used by a NJ school district.  In Phase I, we will develop a proof-of-concept team assessment tool, deliverable over the Internet, and demonstrate is validity in four test beds.  In Phase II we will develop knowledge engineering and assessment authoring tools to allow the AF to develop and validate team performance assessment for domains of its choosing.",

An electrical fuze delay function uses an in-line electronic S & A, while a chemical delay employs an out-line system. Primary explosives with out-line fuze electronic delay present a safety hazard.  Conversely an in-line electronic delay, thus safer, makes use of secondary explosives, which are susceptible to shocks from the projectile launch environment. The object of this program is the realization of a fuze delay function by either using a deflagrating secondary or pyrotechnic explosive.  These explosives, when electrically initiated will accelerate a plate (known as a flyer) at supersonic speeds.  The ensuing shock wave from the plate will detonate an output secondary explosive. To determine the length of attainable delays, several initiating secondary explosives will be investigated in various design configurations.  The most promising design configuration will be fabricated and tested.  A general application will be brought forth.",

The unique structure type affords broad crystal engineering capabilities for tuning properties such as acceptance angles, birefringence, damage thresholds, and temperature bandwidths.  In Phase I, ReyTech, Inc.,  will demonstrate feasibility by preparing small optical quality crystals and evaluate their optical properties. The most promising of these materials will be optimized in Phase II, in preparation for Phase III commercialization.  The need for new optical materials is clearly evident from the substantial amount of time and money being devoted to this research by industry and government agencies.

Thus, the IOINS can continue to navigate during extremely high impulse penetration.  Moreover it is lightweight, compact, consumes a minimum of electrical power, and is potentially much more sensitive over a wider dynamic range than micromachined components.  Its signal processing is simplified since it requires no crystal oscillator.  In addition, the IOINS can be easily mass-produced at low cost to meet the performance specifications of a military inertial navigator.  The outcome of this project will be a set of design specifications for the construction in Phase II of a prototype IOINS capable of inertial navigation in penetrating munitions.",

The hop identification capability of the system will be achieved by identifying the binary code being used by the hostile target.  These identification techniques make use of real time measurements by the monitor of the times of arrival of relatively few transmissions of a single frequency among themany over which the target radio hops.The successful implementation of these techniques will allow the monitor to identify, track, demodulate or disrupt the frequency hopping communications link by constructing a frequency hopper which is equivalent to and synchronized to the one whose frequency hopping pattern is being observed.

The conductivity of these proprietary polymers exceeds 10 S/cm, at temperatures ranging from OK to 480K. Present Ultraconductor films carry in excess of 106 amps / cm2 without heating.  Successful completion of the fabrication development will enable the application of Ultraconductor films to a range of high-value BMDO topic areas, such as fine pitch interconnects, and electromagnetic shielding.  The proposed fabrication process has been experimentally demonstrated, and is an extension of successful fabrication processes. The technique utilizes applied fields for condensing and patterning the intrinsic conducting filaments in Ultraconducting films.  The material, Ultraconductor polymer, is the product of 12 years published research, and 4 years proprietary development. Ultraconductors are presently being developed for a range of applications, in part under USAF and BMDO SBIR contracts.

The complete system will consist of (i) a measurement subsystem to collect and process a time array of data; (ii) an empirical database for reference; and (iii) a pattern-recognition subsystem (PRS) to interpret the measured and stored data.  The measurement subsystem relates travelling torsional waves on each side of the rotating component to each other by their transmission/reflection/absorption coefficients.  This nonintrusive network method is similar to those applied in the past to other wave phenomena, such as microwaves and acoustics.  Temporal changes in these coefficients will be monitored and provide a measure of the rotating-component deterioration.

There have been great technical advancements recently in optoelectronics manufacturing and consequently in the performance of fiber optic links which utilize the advanced optoelectronics components. However, automated computer-aided design (CAD) tools for the design of fiber optic links have not followed the same pace of development.

The amplified signals combine the powers quasi-optically form the radiating antenna elements to form a high power transmit beam in space which is electronically steered by hanging the bias bolage of each active antenna element in the phased array.

The analysis produces a PRI signature on an emitter such that the same emitter is uniquely distinguished from another of the same type, allowing a user to associate an emitter to a specific platform.  Using a narrow band tuner for this analysis isolates the emitter of interest from other signals in the environment ans allows it to be porcessed individually.  This step reduces the burden of existing processors so that detailed analysis can be performed.  Current state-of-the-art processing and wide band architectures may allow that one or more emitters of interest be analyzed for SEID date at the same time.  The analysis may also be performed by processors already tasked to provide other ESM functions. This capability, if added to existing wide band threat warning systems, would strenthen the ESM posture of the host platform without adding any weight, power, size, or additional recurring hardware cost to the platform.  The objective is to determine the utility of a wide band radar receiver architecture in performing SEID functions.",

Estimate the accuracy of the candidate  configurations.  3.     top level  design of the  seeker  with block  diagrams,   simplified schematics and specifications.

Combustion of abundant domestic coal provides low cost power, but it releases over 1 billion tonnes of CO2 per year.  New technology is needed to reduce these CO2 emissions while maintaining this secure energy source which is so essential to the domestic economy.  Long-term geologic sequestration of CO2 in deep western U.S. coalbeds could eliminate 10 to 40 percent of U.S. thermal electric coal emissions.  In this project, the integrity, capacity, and cost of this process for CO2 disposal will be quantitatively evaluated.   Phase I will evaluate 4 major western U.S. coal regions, from North Dakota to Utah, for specific CO2 disposal characterization.  Quantified CO2 disposal capacity and cost will be determined by definition and analysis of secure, long-term storage cells in deep coal units with low mining potential.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Cost effective high volume CO2 disposal technology will be avidly sought by thermal fossil fuel industries as the emission of CO2 becomes more costly.  Quantified CO2 disposal process data is also essential for effective governmental policy decisions.\n\n _",

        "abstract": "Operations of complex systems can become inefficient because of mental overload, fatigue, boredom and lapses in situational awareness, drugs, illness, and other factors; a practical means of monitoring operator state is thus important for many Air Force missions.  In the laboratory, physiological measures such as brain waves, eye blinks and movements, cardiac activity, respiration, and skin conductance, have been frequently demonstrated to provide information about operator state.  Unfortunately, current technology is not adequate to support routine acquisition and timely analysis of physiological measures in naturalistic environments.  To service this need, our R&D program has focused on developing the component technologies required for non-invasively monitoring the mental state of human operators.  These include rugged and portable recording electronics, quick application electrodes and headsets, and EEG signal processing algorithms and analysis software for extracting physiological signals from artifact contaminated data and using them to characterize changes in mental activity.  We propose to integrate these technologies to developd WALKSCAN, a self-contained ambulatory recorder/signal processing system, that will use physiological data to provide continuous estimates of operator state in real-world environments.  In Phase I we will design WALKSCAN and implement a limited-functionality laboratory prototype.  In Phase II it will be fully implemented and field-tested.",

By modifying the amino acids of the recognition helices according to a recently devised recognition code, ZFP's can be designed to bind DNA sequences of choice. This development has made possible the construction of chimeric transcription repressors and activators for regulating genes in plants. We propose to use this emerging technology to alter fatty acid desaturation in both a model system and commercially relevant crop species. In Phase I, we successfully constructed ZFPs capable of recognizing target sequences in a fatty acid desaturase gene of soybean (Glycine max). The custom DNA binding proteins were produced in E. coli and shown to bind to their corresponding target sequences with nanomolar affinities. In Phase II, a second set of ZFPs will be designed for the Arabidopsis version of the desaturase gene. The ZFPs will be optimized for enhanced binding affinity and specificity, they will be inserted into plant expression vectors, and the resulting constructs will be tested in cell culture and whole plants. Success will constitute proof-of-principle for the use of designed ZFPs as a method to alter the expression of genes in plants",

Current furnace technologies are expensive because their extensive requirements for time, space, labor, materials, energy and maintenance, and are harmful to the enviroment due to active atmosphere and heat losses.

The proposed New Induction Technology (patent pending) will dramatically increase customer affordability by reducing the costs of manufacturing and repair of many important parts of aircraft, rotorcraft, ships, submarines, weapon systems, and correspondingly their life-cycle costs. Induction Carburizing can rapidly produce both local and overall protective surface layers not only on steels but on Ti base alloys. There are no restrictions as to part shape or dimensions. The carbon content, depth of penetration, microstructure, and properties can be obtained in seconds or minutes and adjusted as required for reliability and longevity increasing. Unlike current technologies the core temperature and properties remain unchanged, required subsequent cooling, quenching, and reheat treatment can be done simultaneously in the same installation.

        "abstract": "Laboratory infrared scene simulators are traditionally large, complex systems that require a massive electronic infrastructure immediately surrounding the infrared scene emitter and an equally large and complex collection of interface electronic equipment including computers, frame buffers, timing generators, and calibration cameras.  Santa Barbara Infrared Inc., a small company with a long record of commercial application of military technology, has under development a new type of micro-emitter for infrared scene simulation.  This emitter combines a high performance integrated circuit and a micro-resistor array. This new emitter technology dramatically increases the integration of support electronics into the basic emitter itself.  The result is a small, low power efficient emitter with a small footprint.  Santa Barbara Infrared Inc. is poised to bring scene simulator integration to the next generation by moving the infrared scene simulator from the laboratory to the field.  The concept calls for building on the work done so far with highly integrated micro-emitters by adding highly integrated electronics in compact packages for the operation of the emitter.  This proposal is for a feasibility study on the design concept of a third generation scene simulator system for Dynamic Built-In Test/simulation.  The proposal will also produce a specification for such a system.  BENEFITS:  The successful conclusion of the study proposed will provide the specifications for a third generation scene simulator.

In particular, an economically viable eighty mile-per-gallon hybrid electric vehicle is needed for the automotive industry.   This project will develop a novel phase change-augmented thermal management scheme for induction motors that will increase power density and reduce cost per kilowatt by decreasing required magnetic material and overall motor weight per given power output.  In addition to using a conventional water jacket, this scheme will employ passive phase-change heat transfer in the stator end-turns.  Thus, peak temperatures and thermal gradients will be dramatically reduced, leading to increased power density and reduced cost.   Phase I focuses on developing a practical thermal-fluid model of this innovative end-turn cooling scheme that will enable the synthesis of optimal motor designs.  Proof-of-concept experiments will be conducted to verify theoretical assertions and determine the appropriate material(s) and configuration for this cooling scheme.  A preliminary design of a 100 kW traction motor will be produced.  Prototype construction and testing is planned for Phase II.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   This technology should contribute to the overall goal of producing a commercially-viable hybrid electric vehicle for the automotive industry.

        "abstract": "Noise from machinery and other sources may be controlled passively by high transmission loss panels and damping, or actively using discrete localized sensors and actuators to cancel noise.  Effective enclosures for passive noise control are often heavy, especially below 500 Hz, while active noise cancellation systems can be expensive, bulky, and difficult to adapt to different situations.  Satcon proposes to develop light weight high transmission loss panels for noise control.  Panels will be formed from an array of magnetostrictive Metglas sheets mounted in light weight frames (less than 1 kg/m(2)), with adjacent loops of wire terminating in an adjustable impedance.  The Metglas/frame composite panel will act like a dynamic resonator, making its effective mass much greater than its actual mass. The tuning of the panel to achieve dynamic resonance simultaneously over a useful range of frequencies is accomplished by proper choice of the frequency dependence of the loop termination impedance. In principle the choice of impedance can produce any desired acoustic behavior of the panels.  A sample panel will be built and demonstrated in Phase I, and a prototype system, adapted to some sound source of interest to the Army, will be built in Phase II.  Testing and system design will be done with help from BBN Corporation.  BENEFITS:  In addition to disguising noisy military equipment to avoid detection, Metglas acoustic panels can be used wherever low weight is important enough to justify the cost,  including any application where discrete active noise control  (even more expensive) is now used.  Applications include noise control in the interiors of aircraft, luxury cars and yachts, and protection of satellites from damage due to vibration during launch.",

Separation techniques will be investigated for the removal  of the GBW constituents - such as paint chips, heavy metals etc.  that make the  resulting blast media waste hazardous.  An engineering technique to help  minimize the hazardous GBW will be developed and the technical feasibility of  the alternative will be demonstrated during Phase I Option.  Additionally,  engineering feasibility and economic analysis will be performed.   A successful completion of Phase I and Phase I Option will result in the  development of a prototype during the follow-on Phase II effort.",

Schafer Corporation recently completed analyses for the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division that show the benefits of low-cost, low-weight, low-power-consumption micro-electrical-mechanical (MEM) adaptive optics in supporting Navy missions. Under the proposed effort, Schafer will design a lightweight, low-cost closed loop adaptive optics system which will have an integrated wavefront sensor, signal processor, and deformable mirror.  MEM adaptive optics have weight and power characteristics that are  two orders-of-magnitude less than conventional discrete actuator deformable mirrors. We will use the patented comb-drive MEM deformable mirror technology developed by our team member, SY Technology, Inc.  Although some of the missions that were studied in the NAVAIR program will be considered in this SBIR, our emphasis here will be on MEM adaptive optics system design and assessment of the wavefront beacon concept, rather than a mission performance analysis.  Schafer Corporation intends to have the technology developed and fully tested in time to impact the design of 21st  Century tactical EO systems as well as supporting commercial applications in medicine, communications, and astronomy.",

The objective of this Phase I SBIR proposal is to develop packaging and power supply concepts to produce truly compact and efficient lasers.  We will allow the laser crystal and the diodes to operate at relatively high temperatures using only passive cooling.  The resonator structure will be designed to dissipate the waste heat while simultaneously keeping the laser aligned.  We will evaluate Nd:YAG, Nd:YLF, and Nd:YVO(4) laser materials, and we will consider end-pumped rods, side-pumped slabs, and side-pumped rods for the laser configuration.  In the power supply only the diode-laser will be kept relatively cool while the other components will be allowed to heat up, minimizing the size and weight of their heat sinks.  We will also perform a market analysis to determine the commercial potential of such a laser, and we will conclude this effort with a preliminary design targeted at one application.  This design will be refined, and the laser constructed during a follow-on Phase II effort.",

This system must be able to provide assurance that all of the mercury has been removed by the decontamination process.   In this project, an in-pipe mercury assay system will be developed and demonstrated at  the Oak Ridge plant.  This measurement system will be based on an x-ray fluorescence sensor capable of being deployed into intact piping systems using the patented deployment system.  The sensor will provide the radial sensitivity and ability to negotiate elbows necessary for in-pipe measurements.    Phase I will define the measurement requirements, evaluate possible irradiation-detector configurations, and develop a conceptual sensor design that can be fully developed into a prototype design during Phase II.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The resulting measurement system would be added to the existing suite of pipe characterization measurement capabilities.   In addition to mercury, the system would be useful for measurements of other heavy metals such as lead, thereby benefiting other industries with contaminated piping.\n_",

Continuous monitoring of ozone is essential to measure its variability, its transport across regional boundaries,  and the dynamic sources and sinks that control its production.  We propose to develop a novel compact differential absorption lidar (DIAL) to continuously measure ozone concentration profiles with sufficient sensitivity (10ppb) and accuracy (10%), for 10km range with 500m resolution, for averaging under one hour.  A high repetition rate (1kHz), tunable (280-295nm),  0.5mJ/pulse Ce:LiSAF laser, which is pumped by the fourth harmonic (266nm) diode-pumped Nd:YAG laser, will provide both on-and off-line pulses.

There is a need to advance the economic competitiveness of these power systems.  The systems need to use indigenous biomass resources, having significantly improved efficiencies and low emissions.  SARA proposes to develop a modular, charcoal fueled direct carbon fuel cell.  The low pollution levels, simplicity, low cost, and ability to parallel many modules will allow cost effective electric power generation from 10kW to 10MW power levels.  This project will demonstrate the feasibility of a 10kW biomass fueled direct carbon fuel cell (DCFC) using charcoal as a fuel.  It will be sized to generate 10kW electrical power at an efficiency greater than 60%.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   In addition to stationary power for rural villages, schools and hospitals in developing nations, primary power up to 10 MW can be generated for cities and light industrial applications using multiple power system modules.  With further development, the DCFC can also be used for power transportation vehicles._",

Therefore, if the cable shield is degraded, then the hardness of the entire system may be jeopardized.  A number of test techniques and products have been developed and are available for the purpose of testing and evaluating the shielding effectiveness of shielded cables.  However, none offer a practical and cost effective solution for rapid evaluation of a large number of shielded cables during system maintenance.

Sherman, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG02-98ER82663\nAmount:  $74,972\n\nMeeting DOE\u00c2\u00bfs advanced technology goals depends increasingly on the effective use of widely-distributed high performance computing resources.  The ability to access computational power easily and effectively will give researchers an invaluable resource.  To support this, it is essential to have easy-to-use middleware tools for specification and management of distributed computations that provide features such as portability, flexibility, and dynamic adaptivity.  While Java addresses some low-level execution issues, there is a clear need for higher-level integration tools and environments.  This project will investigate a new paradigm for wide-area distributed computing based on Java and the Piranha model for adaptive execution of parallel programs.  The result will be an environment offering not only high performance, portability, and conformance with modern object-orient standards (due to Java), but also dynamic adaptivity and fault tolerance (due to Piranha).  In Phase I, designs will be developed for a new distributed computing environment and its main components (the Applet Piranha Loader, the Applet Java Piranha Class Library, the Java Piranha Application Scheduler, and the Java Feeder Class Library). \n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Java-Piranha would enable users to leverage the tremendous computing power latent in the internet, allowing governmental and commercial organizations to increase productivity and efficiency without acquiring or supporting large numbers of new computers.  It would also facilitate a new \u00c2\u00bfelectric-utility-like\u00c2\u00bf marketplace for computing power by making it possible to aggregate distributed resources dynamically on a metered or \u00c2\u00bfleased\u00c2\u00bf basis._",

        "abstract": "Modern methods of drug discovery rely heavily on computer modeling of potential therapeutic agents to calculate their geometric and electronic properties and optimize them to interact specifically with target receptors with high potency. This process is extremely compute intensive due to the large sizes of the molecular Systems involved. Recently, new linear-scaling algorithms based on fast multipole methods (FMM) have been introduced for computing the electronic structures of such large systems.  Energies, forces, and force constants can now be computed efficiently even on workstations.  However, study of biological systems requires new linear-scaling methods capable of modeling solvation, computing additional important properties, such as excitation energies, and optimizing geometry. Moreover, to enable routine application, it is necessary to exploit highly parallel computer systems.  We propose to address all of these issues by investigating parallel linear-scaling methods suitable for drug design.  In Phase I we will develop prototype parallel versions of FMM-based methods for basic electronic structure calculations and geometry optimization, and we will design algorithms for calculating solvation effects and other properties, such as the lowest-unoccupied and highest-occupied molecular orbitals.  Phase II will include implementation of the latter algorithms along with significant extension, refinement, and testing of all the proposed methods.  BENEFITS:  This project will lead to enhanced software that will dramatically improve the ability of researchers in the DOD, universities, and commercial industry to carry out the kinds of modeling required for advanced drug discovery and other molecular analysis of biological systems.  Since the software will be based on widely used commercial computing and chemistry technologies, it will have broad appeal and be readily accessible to research groups involved in the design of future medicinal and agricultural products as well as to material scientists designing new alloys, propellants, and explosives.",

The design will use security services offered by a new breed of Object Request Brokers (ORBS) that meet the CORBA Security Service Specification.  The design will, at a minimum, provide three forms of security for TACTICS simulation users: (1) identification and authentication of all simulation users, (2) integrity and confidentiality of all simulation data, and (3) audit of all simulation activity.  Support for other forms of security (e.g., access control, non-repudiation, availability, time service, secret sharing target authentication) will be considered, based on anticipated uses of TACTICS-based simulations.  Information will be solicited from ORB vendors regarding capabilities of current and future secure ORB implementations in order to determine or estimate their adequacy and to influence the design.  The design will facilitate a phased implementation plan that leverages initial secure ORB capabilities while leaving room for incorporation of future advances in the implementation of secure ORBS.  BENEFITS:  The results of this work will promote common simulation capabilities across military and industry by providing a secure environment for simulation activities.

This system is optimized to reject the background from both the Rayleigh scattered solar radiation and the blackbody emission from the rocket engine.  Dual liquid crystal Fabry-Perot etalons form the basis of this spectrometer.  The high throughput of etalons is exploited to produce a spectrometer that has a resolution greater than that of a grating system, yet it is smaller and lighter.  In the first phase of the project a ground-based, small field instrument is built and designs are established for an airborne, wide field system to be built in phase II.",

We will examine both requirements of specific technologies employed by those applications and general requirements for coordinating distributed applications with the aim of abstracting general functions, commands, or features that will be benefit entire classes of applications, both those developed today and those to be developed in the future. We will then look for general methods for implementing these features and attempt to develop a set of requirements for selected application oriented Active Network features. Finally, we will examine proposed implementation methods and suggest how to use one or more of them to provide the selected Active Network features and algorithms.  BENEFITS:  This strategy will allow current Active Network techniques to be applied selectively where they can optimally provide demonstrated services to a new class of network and computer applications.",

Scientific Systems proposes to integrate these modules within a highly flexible and user-friendly Intelligent Control Design Tool (ICDT) for Matlab that will include the design of System Identification (SI) and Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based adaptive control algorithms, and intelligent supervisory control modules based on the system response and fuzzy logic. MPC framework will enable the designer to develop efficient control algorithms for both linear and nonlinear models in the case of hard constraints on control inputs, system outputs, and states. The presence of system nonlinearities and uncertainties will be addressed by both the extensions of several existing identification techniques to nonlinear models, and by the development of MPC-based neural network identification and control algorithms. To preserve robustness under large perturbations, uncertainties, and sensor and actuator failures, the suggested control system will have substantial reconfiguration capabilities introduced by supervisory control based on on-line adaptation, fuzzy rules and Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) mechanisms. The feasibility of the intelligent MPC algorithms will be tested through simulations of Eagle Eye UAV, or other Uninhabited Combat Air Vehicle (UCAV) model recommended by the Navy.  Prof. K.S.

        "abstract": "The accuracy and robustness of  target state estimators to target maneuvers and varying target characteristics have been one of the limiting factors to improving the interceptor's terminal performance and direct hit capability.  This effort will examine techniques to improve the accuracy of the onboard target state estimators, and thereby improve the miss distance performance of homing interceptors.  The solution proposed here to improve tracking performance is based on the Interacting Multiple Model (IMM)  Kalman filter estimator which has been used successfully by Scientific Systems for ship-board radar target tracking of highly maneuvering targets under ECM and clutter conditions.   The IMM Kalman filter can handle target maneuvers with a significantly smaller estimation error and track loss rate compared to a single Kalman filter. The IMM-KF has proven to be  robust  and extremely fast in maneuver detection.  We will consider both active and passive tracking of targets by the interceptor. The active tracking problem is similar to the one considered earlier, but the passive or semi-active LOS tracking problem is non-linear and poorly observable. We will use an approach by Jauffret and Pillon (1996) to linearize the measurement equation, and  investigate the effects of using an accurate initial position estimate obtained by a radar. We will also investigate the use of sparse active measurements and their  effect on the tracking performance.  The combined performance of an Adavance Guidance Law (AGL) and IMM-KF algorithm will be evaluated using the simulation of a navy interceptor missile.   Prof. Y. Bar-Shalom,  a leading authority in the field of estimation and target tracking and one of the developers of the IMM-KF algorithm  will provide  support to the project as a consultant.",

All system control is RS232-based, and data are output through a generalized interface.  An advanced web browser/Java interface provides platform independent, remote user control and telescience capabilities over the network.In our modular design we have also attempted to address the issue of system obsolescence, which is a constant problem with electronic equipment.  The system functionality is divided in such a way that chip components and control sfotware, aplicable now, can be upgraded as more capable devices and tools emerge.  This will help to ensure the longevity of the design, and thus have a minimum impact on continued radio science observations.",

A preliminary examination of the characteristics and behavior of marine mammals suggests that a unique dedicated passive acoustic sensor system could be developed from existing sonobuoy technology. It would have near 100% probability of detection and would be a cost effective adjunct to the existing technique of visual observations.  A program is proposed for the development of a passive acoustic sensor and processor/display system meeting those criteria.  A comprehensive analysis of the vocalization characteristics and behavior of cetaceans and other marine mammals will be used to determine system characteristics for optimizing detection and localization.  Frequency range, source level, conditions that induce vocalizations and variety of sounds will be important criteria.  Omnidirectional and directional sensors will be compared for detection effectiveness, complexity, number of sensors required and cost.  Various processing schemes will be evaluated to determine the most effective method of detection and localization.  The goal is to develop a practical, simple, cost effective and flexible system.",

Customers need improved firewall performance and throughput for Virtual Private Networks and multimedia traffic as they move to higher performance T3 and Asynchronous Transfer Mode lines.  Neither faster firewall processors nor more memory will provide the necessary performance boost.  To significantly reduce latency and increase firewall performance for both real time (multimedia) and encrypted data, security coprocessing features can be added to the Input/Output subsystems by exploiting the emerging Intelligent Input/Output architecture.  Phase 1 will provide a detailed feasibility analysis of the proposed architecture.  The analysis will also include a security vulnerability assessment and performance projections.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The benefits to government and industry include significant throughput improvements for Virtual Private Networks, multimedia, and encrypted traffic.  The proposed architecture is based on industry standards, is scalable, and can be incorporated in Windows NT and UNIX firewalls and other systems supporting the platform independent Intelligent Input/Output architecture.\n\n\n\n\n\n_",

        "abstract": "Workflow management systems (WMS) may control access between hundreds of users and thousands of objects, so simplified policy management is critical. WMS developers recommend Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) since roles occur naturally in workflows; however, the typical RBAC model lacks the framework to express workflow policies adequately. \n\nTraditionally, a WMS mediates accesses to objects in its workflows. As workflow technology grows in popularity, workflows eventually may control distributed objects such as managed by CORBA and COM/DCOM. Protections must be added to these objects to prevent users from circumventing the WMS and accessing the objects directly. \n\nWe propose the Workflow Policy Server (WPS) to address these challenges. The WPS simplifies workflow policy management with a powerful RBAC Model that has been extended with workflow concepts. In particular, the concept of a workflow task or 'step' has been added. Distributed objects are protected because the WPS can push out the access control policy for a specific stop when directed. The WPS translates the step's policy into the enforcement language of the target object manager.",

Our team proposes to develop a general purpose, helmet mounted laser diode-based transmitter and receiver establishing a secure communication                             d listner.  Alow profile array of detectors is capable of receiving the signal from any direction.  The transceiver will be detachable, small and rugged.  Laser diodes at 1550 nm are eyesafe and invisible to the eye and all but the most advanced night vivion technology.  The devices will deliver enough output power when properly focused to enable communication as far as 2 km without extraordinary alignment procedures.  Challenges to implementing this technology stem from the ergonomic reality that helmet lasers can only be crudely aligned; expanding the beam has the effect of reducing the signal to noise ratio necessitating the use of more powerful, expensive, energy consuming lasers.  A major part of this proposal addresses the laser detector, and electronics that together yield a practical solution.  Phase I will conclude with:  (1) delivery of two helmet mounted transmitter/receiver prototypes sufficient for the Air Force's field tests, (2) our own measurements of performance specifications and (3) a complete cost analysis.",

The innovation is a 16-element 1.0 - 2.5 um InGaAs FPA mated with a 16-wavelength dielectric stack filter array and silicon readout multiplexer.  The hybrid assembly will be mounted on a thermoelectric cooler into a small TO-8 package for high sensitivity (D*>10 12cm(Hz)1/2 /W) operation.  The result will be an application-specific spectrometer that fits in a one-inch cube.  This program addresses a fundamental problem of application spectroscopy: few wavelengths are required, but they are more widely spaced than can be detected with a single FPA with a finite number of pixels mounted on a spectrograph with fixed dispersion.  The array, multiplexer, and packaging will be universal; the dielectric stack array will customize the device to specific applications.  In Phase I, we will develop the 16-element InGaAs array and integrate it with a mosaic of dielectric stack filters.  A packaged device will be delivered.  In Phase II, we will develop and fabricate a dielectric stack filter array and silicon readout multiplexer specific to an application chosen in conjunction with the Technical Monitor.",

The imporvement is attributed to larger mode size and lower optical loss from free-carrier absorption in the quantum wells and cladding regions.  We propose to demonstrate high power single aperture InGaAsP/InP laser diodes at 1.9 um and to fabricate linear-arrays with substantially higher powers than available today.  During Phase I we will use gas-source moleculear beam epitaxy (GSMBE) to grow loss-loss, high efficiency, BW laser structures.  The thickness and bandgap of the waveguide layer will be optimized for low internal loss, low threshold current and high internal efficiency.  High power 200 um aperture single and a 1x5 linear array will be delivered.  In Phase II, BW lasers with strain compensated active regions, will be fabricated.  These designs will reduce the temperature sensitivity, increase the wavelength to 2 um and yield higher powers.  Linear arrays with high-efficiency, temperature insensitive lasers will be fabricated.  Prof. S.R. Forrest and Chris Dreis of Princeton University will consult.",

BitSURE(tm) modem technology creates a robust communication link under a wide rang of conditions, including high interference, distortion, and jamming.  BitSURE's(tm) flexible spreading capability accommodates all link conditions and provides protection against unauthorized detection through lower spectral density and the intentional use of local interference.  Thus, BitSURE(tm) is ideal for a variety of high-speed wireless communications applications where link pathologies make traditional communications impractical, or where such pathologies are part of a strategy to mask the communications link.  BitSURE(tm) technology provides for error rate of 10(-10) or better, facilitating encryption and reliable transmission of critical data as well as high resolution live video.  The proposed program, through Phase II, will dramatically extend design and functionality, and provide an entry into Phase III, where BitSURE(tm) modems will be developed as commercial and military products.  Anticipated products resulting from a successful program will benefit a wide variety of military and commercial applications.  Military applications include covert high-speed communications, tactical communications and DARPA's GLOMO program.  Commercially, SiCOM will sell ICs for modems for unlicensed bands, where interference is rapidly becoming a serious problem, for uses such as: bypass of wired infrastructure, wireless T1 links to businesses, schools, internet service providers, etc., and campus building/LAN bridges.",

        "abstract": "One of the challenges facing researchers who measure multiple fragment trajectories of modern weapons is the retrieval of useful data.  Data is not simply a time record of two-dimensional images of the dynamic event.  Useful data is, among others, the actual trajectory of those fragments.  In order to acquire useful data, it is necessary to develop an interface between the time record of images and the desired data set.  By making the interface as autonomous as possible, useful data can be gleaned from the images at a faster rate than can be acquired with a purely human interface.  Furthermore, due to the tremendous amount of data that an be generated in a short period of time, and in hazardous environments, it is sometimes necessary to provide a hardware solution of transmitting the data from the hazardous environment to a safer one. Under the Phase I effort, SMD proposes to evaluate a total high-speed imaging system that can be remotely operated and controlled and is capable of 10,000,000 frames per second that can provide parameter extraction from a generated three-dimensional model.",

        "abstract": "In the almost three decades since its inception, laser radar has progressed from cumbersome laboratory prototypes to reliable field systems.  LADAR systems are currently based upon either a pulsed, time of flight measurement technique or a coherent detection scheme.  Time of flight measurements systems are effective but suffer from limited spatial resolution and susceptibility to target camouflaging techniques.  The coherent modulation technique offers many advantages including increased signal to noise ratio, simplified light sources and a higher immunity to multi-pulse camouflage methods.  To date, the primary limitation to the coherent receiver concept is the availability of high speed, low noise detectors which offer a reasonable range, spatial and gray scale resolution.  SMD proposes the development of an imaging LADAR that is capable of operating at 2,000,000 fps, and storing 16 images at 256 x 256 resolution.  The detector and source are illuminated to form a coherent imaging LADAR system that measures range by modulation of both the source and intensifier gain.  The sensor package can be fitted with a filter system to provide multi-spectral LADAR imagery for diverse applications including standard range measurements, atmospheric constituency information, and direct wind detection.",

An example includes flameout detectors on uncooled aircraft engine operating in excess of 600 degrees C and beyond. Non of the traditional process control technologies is suitable nor efficient enough to support the fabrication of these SiC structures.  Simpex Technologies' proposed technology consists of two independent lasers. The pulse laser is used as the source while the continuous wave laser is used as the detector. Simply, our technique represents an automation of the classical `tap test' in which the surface is struck in some fashion and an experienced listener determines the flaw and adhesion from the sound generated.

Design iteration is typically very expensive and error prone even when done on a computer, since the complex process must be managed manually by an engineer.  Lack of automation in the design process leads to long design times and sub-optimal hardware.

An architecture based on executable software component technology will enable the tool to effectively use the distributed computational power of networked computers, easily integrate with other products, and be user-extensible.  The design automation software will be developed utilizing a client/server architecture.  A Design Optimization Client will obtain services from three software objects, each of which may reside either on the local machine or on a networked machine: a design-of-experiment server implementing the Taguchi method, a functional optimization server implementing a local search algorithm, and an analysis server.  The analysis server will be interfaced to the GOOFEE finite element code from the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, and the complete package will be demonstrated on a design optimization problem involving an accelerator cavity on a heterogeneous network of Windows NT and UNIX computers.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   Electromagnetic design automation software has the potential to reduce costs and improve product performance in the communications and computer industries, where shortened product life-cycles and other market pressures require better products in less time and for less money.

UCT utilizes existing hardware components that are available from a multiplicity of manufacturers and can easily be assembled into a CT system, by employing techniques and applying software that we have already developed.  The RTR system is based on deep-well charge coupled devices (CCDS) that are optically coupled to a scintillating x-ray screen.  Such screens are very inexpensive, and they can easily and quickly be interchanged, allowing usage of the system over the 50 keV-5OMeV x-ray energy range.  UCT can be used with our existing cone-beam reconstruction algorithm.  This approach allows for much higher spatial resolution in the axial direction of the munition and a much higher throughput, because many slices worth of data are obtained simultaneously.  Coded anomaly detection and measurement algorithms have already been successfully tested on a substantial database of munitions/ rocket motor data.  The team of Skiametrics, Perceptics/ Northrop, and Alliant has a strong record of CT implementation over the last 15 years, including the first production usage of CT as a primary inspection mode on a military program.

        "abstract": "Ballistic missile defense applications of the future will require ever more powerful electronic devices, capable of operation at high frequencies and power and able to withstand high temperatures. Gallium nitride is one of the most promising materials for such applications. Although a number of devices such as light emitting diodes and junction field effect transistors have been fabricated using GaN, material quality remains a stumbling block to full utilization of its potential.  SKION proposes to provide a breakthrough in GaN deposition using its patented metal ion beam technology. This process precisely controls the energy of the deposited species, enabling the production of thin films with precise crystalline phase control and high film quality at lower deposition temperatures than possible with the current state-of-the-art.  In this Phase I program SKION will develop and demonstrate a novel Ga+ ion source based on a modification of its well-demonstrated and commercialized Cs+ ion beam technology. This new source will be used to deposit high-quality GaN thin films on silicon substrates. For this effort SKION will team with Arizona State University. The ASU group was the first to demonstrate that the Ga and N direct ion beam method is superior to thermal techniques. To combine ASU's experience in ion beam deposition of wide bandgap semiconductors with SKION's process and equipment expertise will ensure successful process development for heteroepitaxial GaN on Si. Program objectives include development of the new high area Ga+ ion source and demonstration of epitaxial GaN growth on 4                                                                    ed for improved electronic materials, including exploitation of the unusual electronic properties of GaN.",

A major problem for the European starch potato industry is the high levels of glycoalkaloids concentrated in the potato waste stream. Traditionally this potato waste is fed to animals, but the high levels of glycoalkaloids in the waste solids reduces their usefulness as fodder. Potato breeders world-wide have problems with high levels of glycoalkaloids, because they are often associated with desirable traits. The proposed program will create transgenic potatoes, using an antisense gene to inhibit the biosynthesis of glycoalkaloids.

Presently, indium tin oxide (ITO) is used because it is an accepted standard and has a great deal of invested development. However, for several reasons, including work function, physical stability, and band alignment to organics, ITO is not necessarily the ideal contact layer for a given organic LED. In Phase L we propose to produce a series of alternative transparent and conductive films, fabricate working organic devices and evaluate performance issues. The new transparent and conductive oxide films will be produced using our existing MOCVD equipment and established processing techniques. The organic LEDs will be fabricated by thermal evaporation of tris 8--hydroxyquinoline aluminum (Alq) and naphthyl-substituted benzidine (NPB) at The University of Rochester, with guidance by researchers at Eastman Kodak. Films and devices will be evaluated by all participants. In Phase II we will refine the contact layer film properties and optimize working OLEDs, transitioning our device improvements into manufactured products for Phase III.",

When combined with our object image processing, Fast Identification and Tracking (FIT) system , we will be able to identify individual objects in any orientation, with small databases of salient features rapidly in real-time with a microprocessor.

        "abstract": "The modern military's information processing needs are continually and rapidly changing due to broadening operational requirements, conflict areas, and adversaries.  To effectively provide our warfighters with information superiority, a mechanism to dynamically alter an automated systems functionality and visualization must be provided.  To address this need SPS proposes to develop the Rapid Application Builder Based on Internet Technologies (RABBIT).  RABBIT is an innovative combination of end-user, model-based RAD techniques, GIS display capabilities, military and Internet-based standards, and architecture driven component-based application development.  RABBIT combines these capabilities in an environment that supports end-user composition of complex applications.  The Phase I effort will generate a specification and early demonstration of RABBIT. The Phase II will build RABBIT based upon a commercial integrated development environment that supports non-programmed component composition.  RABBIT will be developed by a highly qualified team from software Productivity Solutions whose expertise spans model-based RAD, Internet development standards and technologies, and software architectural driven component-based reuse.  RABBIT will be highly viable in the commercial marketplace as the growth of the Internet further increases application demand and the need for end-user application development becomes the only viable approach to satisfying this need.  BENEFITS:  The need for end-user composition of complex applications is driven by rapid requirements evolution in both military and commercial markets. Applications incorporating GIS displays are becoming commonplace as an effective means of visualizing enterprise information.  The Internet and component based application development is rapidly becoming the computing paradigm of choice for all types of application.

The thermionic thermal detector is a new type of device whose operation is not related to classic photoemissive Schottky diode photon detectors. The TTD operates uncooled with the individual elements thermally isolated (as in a microbolometer), and uses a reverse bias Schottky diode as the sensing element. For a fixed bias voltage and Schottky barrier height, the magnitude of the reverse bias current from the diode is a measure of the diode temperature.

Commercial SI gasoline engines will be identified and their SCS conversion potential assessed.  The SCS NRL design will be scaled to the engine most suitable for this application.  Under subcontract, Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) of McLean, VA will help design modifications to the engine necessary to meet the 9000g setback acceleration and other SBIR transition interface requirements.

Under support of a SBIR Phase I grant, SoSun and Clemson University have established that plant growth in the AcclimatronTM System is enhanced by CO2 enrichment. Since the enclosed AcclimatronTM atmosphere is temperature-maintained even during high daytime temperatures, plant units, called CU-StartsTM, inside the AcclimatronTM receive the benefit of CO2 enrichment conditions resulted in dry matter accumulations for Hosta ?Newberry' Gold up to twice that of plants grown under ambient CO2 levels. An interactive effect of CO2 level with natural sunlight levels was observed.

The detection system must be able to distinguish among numerous compounds in real time without using traditional methods of chromatographic separation.  The proposing company, Southwest Sciences, has invented an improved mass spectrometer that will be particularly useful for studying decomposition of energetic materials.  The approach, called ionization energy modulated mass spectrometry (IEMMS), combines conventional mass spectral data with information about the appearance potentials of the ions to generate a two-dimensional spectrum in order to identify the difference species produced. Microsecond time resolution is possible.  IEMMS should provide complementary information to the diagnostic techniques (primarily step-scanned Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) now used in mechanistic and kenetic studies of energetic material decomposition chemistry.  The Phase I effort will demonstrate the usefulness of IEMMS by analyzing binary mixtures of key compounds that cannot usually be distinguished by conventional mass spectrometry and/or cannot be detected readily using optical spectroscopy.  The Phase II project will culminate in the construction, testing, and delivery to the Air Force Research Laboratory of an ionization energy modulated mass spectrometer configured with a pulsed pyrolysis source.",

A planar thermal conductivity of greater than 1700 W/m-K makes TPG nearly as conductive as pure diamond, at a small fraction of the cost.  By comparison, most common electronic materials used for heat distribution provide thermal conductivities between 100 and 300 W/m-K.  When reinforced with an encapsulation for greater strength and stiffness, the composite is usable for structural elements within the 3-D stack.  Temperature rise within the 3-D stack may be reduced by factors of 5 or more if certain elements of the 3-D stack structure are replaced with TPG-based components.  This type of reduction in temperature will have an enormous benefit on electronic circuit reliability , as well as extend the application of 3-D stack technology to systems required to operate over wide temperature ranges.",

The NDI&E method utilizes remotely located impedance sensor to periodically monitor changes in the structural stiffness, mass and damping. Damage to the joint fasteners or connection materials causes direct changes in the overall joint stiffness and damping. Mass changes also occur but are usually of lower order significance. The impedance sensors consist of small piezoelectric patches that are used to directly measure the structure's dynamic response. Because the sensors are very lightweight, robust, and inexpensive, they can be readily located at critical inspection points over an entire structure. With the sensors in place, the structural integrity can be inspected [remotely from outside the structure, and the resulting signals can be integrated into control systems. Recent advances in signal processing techniques may yield additional concise information pertaining to the nature of the damage. The method can potentially save millions of dollars on inspection and operation costs over the life of a structure.",

        "abstract": "The consolidation of Air Force Laboratories into the single Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) integrates organizations in New York with organizations in Ohio.  This consolidation, coupled with declining defense budgets and personnel, increases the urgency of implementing the AFRL Collaborative Engineering Environment to support collaboration on C4I research.  In order for the CEE to support mission requirements, the CEE must be integrated with existing research models and simulations (M&S) and analysis tools.     S*R proposes to develop the COLECTR tool set to automate much of the task to integrate legacy applications with the CEE Core Processing System (CPS).  Integration with the CEE will be supported by Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corporation (Ball); as Ball is developing the CEE infrastructure.  COLECTR will incorporate a set of software re-engineering tools in a CEE compliant agent called the Legacy Introspection Agent (LIA).  LIA will seamless integrate with the CPS to support integrating legacy applications.  In Phase I, S*R will integrate a prototype of COLECTR and integrate it as an external CEE application to demonstrate the system functional capabilities.  The LIA will then be designed and implementation of Java tools to support Phase II implementation will continue during the last six months of Phase I.",

        "abstract": "Accurate modeling of radiation from rocket plumes is critical for remote sensing simulations and assessing vehicle base heating.  Current computer models use approximate radiative transfer and computational methods that were developed 20-30 years ago.  A unified, general, and accurate approach for rocket plume radiation is needed that takes advantage of rapid advances in computer speed and parallel processing and in radiative transfer modeling.  Spectral Sciences, Inc. proposes to develop a new code for plume radiation using recently developed techniques implemented in state-of-the-art atmospheric radiation models.  The objectives are to handle the IR through UV spectrum, altutides from ground to space, two-phase and scattering effects, LTE and non-LTE conditions, and 3D geometries.  The code will use an innovative Correlated-k approach for treating molecular absorption.  Advantages include the ability to handle large temperature and pressure gradients and adherence to Beer's law for proper treatment of scattering.  Phase I will demonstrate this approach in the IR wavelength region for 3D gaseous plumes.  In Phase II the method will be extended to the UV-visible region, the scattering algorithm will be fully implemented, user and flowfield interfaces will be developed, and the code will be delivered.",

This value has surpassed the result of decades of development on magnetostrictive Tefenol-D and piezoelectric PZT materials, two major commercial actuator materials.  It is also higher than the 1% of free strain obtained in the difficult grown single crystal lead manganate niobate (PMN), which recently attracted a lot of attention in DoD and actuator community.  In this Phase I program Spinix Corporation proposes to search new composition of magnetic shape memory alloys for even higher free strain and higher operation temperature by a combinatorial synthesis method.  This approach will produce hundreds of samples in millimeter sizes with different combinations of compositions on a single wafer.

Vernon, Principal Investigator\nDr. Everett S. McGinley, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG02-98ER82672\nAmount:  $74,932\n\nNuclear Physics research has a need for small, reliable, room-temperature thermal neutron detector arrays having improved performance in terms of higher sensitivity and lower dark currents.  Such detectors are also needed for interrogation of radiation environments in such arenas as energy production, industry, research, treaty verification, and tracking of illicit materials.  This project will develop a GaAs-based diode detector with a PIN junction (grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition), leading to improved performance over past designs which used Schottky barriers deposited directly on bulk GaAs semi-insulating wafers.  Those wafers had poor carrier-transport properties (and lower sensitivity) compared with the high-quality epitaxially grown GaAs.  Phase I will develop epitaxially grown GaAs diode structures, comparing both PIN-junction and Schottky barrier designs.  Buffer layers of AlGaAs, to block unwanted carriers and getter impurities, will also be examined.  Detectors, having boron-10 converter layers on the front, will be designed, fabricated, and tested in a flux of thermal neutrons.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   The detectors to be developed here will lead to reliable, room-temperature, high-sensitivity, low-bias, low-noise radiation-monitoring instrumentation for imaging neutron sources with high spatial resolution.  Ultimately, integrated pixel arrays will be developed._",

The alloy proposed is gallium arsenide nitirde, GaAs(1-x) N(x), with a few percent nitrogen, which is closely matched to the GaAs lattice and has a bandgap which can be adjusted from 1.45 eV to less than 1.0 eV. This material will be grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) to be highly p-type (by carbon incorporation) without the use of external dopants; this makes it ideal for the base layer in a GaAs-GaAs(1-x)N(x) HBT.  Use of this GaN-related alloy should lead to improved operation at high temperature, and improved reliability.In Phase I, we will design a GaAsN HBT structure, develop growth of GAAsN, characterize material properties, and calibrate growth parameters to obtain high P+ doping.  The Phase I optional task will be for growth of GaAs-GaAs(1-x)N(X) heterojunctions, and fabrication and testing of n/P+ diodes.

        "abstract": "This proposal addresses the development of a non-invasive, non-contact optical electrode (optrode) for rapidly determining a person's vital signs at or near the scenes of battlefield trauma.  In particular, a sensor is proposed that uses fiber optic and integrated optic technologies for rapid determination of an electrocardiogram (ECG).  Heart rate can also be determined from the ECG signal.  The fiber optic based ECG sensor (optrode) can be integrated within a suite of other small, low-powered, non-contact sensors supported by hand-held, PC-based computers.  The sensor will process the ECG signal and communicate the information by a local area network embedded in the soldier's uniform.  This information is then transmitted to command and medical personnel who will be able to monitor the physiological threats to health and life of a soldier operating in a realistic field environment.  The optrode consists of a miniature electro-optic crystal based intensity modulator mounted at the end of an optical fiber.  The optical interface uses the electro-optic effect to convert weak bioelectric potentials, produced at the skin surface, to measurable electrical signals.  Common-mode rejection of unwanted electrical signals is provided by applying the outputs of the optrodes to remote differential amplifiers connected to conventional physiological recording devices interfaced to a personal computer.  BENEFITS:  It would eliminate the need for time-consuming and troublesome electrode attachment and allow medical personnel to routinely monitor various important physiological parameters.  The system would allow for a wide spectrum of monitoring capabilities for patients outside of a restrictive hospital setting.

        "abstract": "This proposal addresses the development of a dry, high-impedance electrode for physiological monitoring in operational environments.  In particular, a device is proposed that uses optical fiber based voltage sensing technology to provide an optoelectronic interface to standard electrical recording devices.  This optical-based-electrode (optrode) can be placed in contact with the skin and record physiological signals without requiring any special skin preparation.  When placed in the helmet, a suite of such optrodes would provide the high-impedance, high-sensitivity interface needed to monitor the physiological status of various warfighters, including aviators, in battlefield scenarios.  The optrode consists of a miniature electro-optic crystal based intensity modulator mounted at the end of an optical fiber.  The optical interface uses the electro-optic effect to convert weak bioelectric potentials, produced at the skin surface, to measurable electrical signals.  Common-mode rejection of unwanted electrical signals is provided by applying the outputs of the optrodes to remote differential amplifiers connected to conventional physiological recording devices.  Because the electro-optic crystal presents a very high impedance and very low capacitance, the optrode need not be in good physical contact with the head.  Therefore, the points of contact can be dry.  It should thus be feasible to obtain routine, real-time physiological recording with the minimum of setup time.  BENEFITS:  The -need for time-cionsuming and troublesome electrode attachment and allow medical personnel to routinely monitor various important physiological parameters.  The system would allow for a wide spectrum of monitoring capabilities for patients outside of a restrictive hospital setting.  For example, this technology can be used in many civilian applications involving health and safety patient monitoring by fireman, police and rescue workers during emergency situations.",

The paraffin actuator is a simple, reliable device with abundant flight heritage.  It has potential for ectremely accurate positioning control.  It will provide prescise linear actuation with ample stroke and high output force using low power in a compact, lightweight, reliable package that is easy to control.  The latching mechanism is both unique and innovative.  It is fundamentally different from other latching concepts because it does not rely on the mechanical contact of two mating surfaces.  Instead it utilizes a low melting point alloy to freeze and hold the actuator output shaft in the desired position.  This latching concept can be applied to other types of actuators and latches (both linear and rotary) including high bandwidth piezo actuators.

Kimura, Principal Investigator\nDr. Kem E. Robinson, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG03-98ER82673\nAmount:  $75,000\n\n\nAdvanced nondestructive beam diagnostics are needed which are capable of measuring and monitoring, in real-time, critical accelerator beam parameters such as divergence, profile, emittance, and bunch length.  These diagnostics should also be compatible with automatic accelerator tuning and computer control.  Accelerators, such as the 4-GeV Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, cannot use destructive diagnostics under continuous operation.  However, conventional nondestructive diagnostics cannot easily provide all the beam information required.  This project will develop a new diagnostic technique based upon diffraction radiation (DR), which is capable of measuring, in real-time and simultaneously, the beam transverse (spatial) distribution, longitudinal (temporal) distribution, divergence, emittance, and energy in a nondestructive manner.  The design will be inherently compact and will be easily interfaced with computer control systems.  The primary objectives of Phase I are to perform additional analysis to optimize the configuration, develop DR codes from existing transition radiation codes, and develop baseline designs for DR diagnostics.  Prototype DR diagnostics will be constructed and tested during Phase II.  These prototypes will then form the basis for commercial products, which would be customized depending on the end user\u00c2\u00bfs requirements.  \n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  These diagnostics can be used on leptonhadron and ion accelerators and with moderate to high energy and low to high current beams.  Because these diagnostic techniques will be nondestructive and compact in size, accelerator operators and users can use them to characterize the beam at multiple locations along the beamline and within their experiments.  The beam information provided can be used for automated computer control of the accelerator.  Commercial customers would include government, academic, medical, and industrial facilities._",

The implementation of state-of-the-art probabilistic, diagnostic and prognostic techniques will include; advanced stochastic map (random field) models used for pattern recognition, Bayesian belief analysis for updating statistical information from models/measurements, and the Karhunen-Loeve (KL) expansion as a stochastic fault classifier.  Component prognostics will assess thermomechanical fatigue and creep life in critical engine components utilizing efficient Monte Carlo simulation procedures and algorithms taking into account the interaction of LCF/HCF/creep failure modes.  Remaining life predictions and probabilistic risk assessment will be based on the results from the real-time diagnostic/prognostic modules and corresponding economic and safety consequences.The proposed program has genuine support from GE Aircraft Engines and Rolls-Royce that is based on a strong working relationship that recently resulted in the successful completion of an advanced engine health monitoring system for the NAVY F405 engine and future development for the GE F101 engine.",

As a result of the Phase I effort, the maintenance cost comparison/optimization tool will accept the probabilistic engineering results/data from any of these levels to assess the maintenance cost benefits of new component designs or optimal replacement/refurbish/refurbishment intevals for specified components.The proposed program has genuine support from GE Aircraft Engines and Allison Advanced Development Company, both of which recognize, the benefits of a maintenance cost analysis program utilizing probabilistic component lifting and risk analysis programs and represents unparalleled value to the USAF.",

        "abstract": "Airborne bistatic radar has been drawing great interest in recent years.  A major portion of the attention is drawn to its potential in an airborne configuration, where, for example, an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is used as a passive receiver, and interest in space-based systems is also likely to be high in the future.  Adequacy of the exisitng space-time adaptive processing (STAP) algorithms in such settings is of great concern.  The proposed effort considers the effects of the bistatic geometry on space=time adaptive processing.  The goal is both to characterize a parametric model for the received bistatic waveform and to develop a MATLAB based signal processing/evaluation tool.  The result is a means to describe and assess how the characteristics of the received signal depend on platform motion, beam profile, internal clutter motion, and the three-dimensional bistatic geometry.  This work will be necessary when evaluating a large inventory of STAP algortihms specific for bistatic space-based radars.  There are four tasks to be accomplished.  First, we will implement formulas for the bistatic geometry relationships (these are described in detail in section d).  Second, a bistatic equivalent of the constant Gamma model for out-of-plane scattering.  Those results are then combined to produce a MATLAB based for the purpose of generating simulated bistatic received waveforms.  This data generation capability provides an input process for the parametric evaluation of the STAP algorithms.  Finally, verificaiton using measured bistatic data will be performed, and the issues of extending the results to the space-based bistatic systems will be investigated.",

It is proposed to analyze the problems associated with the collection of data by different TWS sensors, to determine the distortions caused by the different problems, and to identify the type of signal/image processing tools to be applied for solving the different distortions.  Amongst the sensors to be analyzed are 3D Radar, Millimeter-wave, RF, and Acoustic for both civilian and military applications of law enforcement and corrections.  It is also proposed to determine the advantages and weaknesses of each type of sensor in order to be able to decide how and which sensors should be used conjointly in a fusion process to enhance the data interpretation capabilities.

        "abstract": "We propose an innovative architecture for a unique and important class of decision aids.  Traditionally, decision aids have been used to help manage the vast amounts of information that may be pertinent to time-critical decisions.  In contrast, our project will focus on developing a tool that advises human decision makers as to when the assumptions which form the basis of their plans are no longer valid.  The Cooperative Decision Management Tool (CDMT) will track decision rationale and assumptions explicitly, identify invalid decisions, and efficiently propagate information corrections and updates to all affected individuals in a way not currently possible (effectively providing active information filtering, fusion, and prioritization).  The CDMT would be interfaced to current planning, management, and decision support tools, and be useable over computer networks.  The CDMT will include several AI concepts which have been combined into a system of theories, capabilities, and formalisms, explicitly to aid the management and coordination of complex cognitive tasks.  This system (called Redux) has been extensively studied, extended, and tested with real domain problems by Stanford University's Dr. Charles Petrie, a leading researcher in the field of collaborative problem-solving.  We will prove CDMT's feasibility by developing a proof-of-concept, limited prototype in Phase I.  BENEFITS: The CDMT will dramatically reduce response time and errors, and will increase the quality of decisions for highly time-constrained, complex, and distributed battle management.  Because this effort directly addresses perhaps the most important issues in military operations the potential military market opportunities are enormous.",

Since the representation and automatic execution of tactics is a complex problem we will take an integrated approach using a variety of paradigms, including tactical diagrams and drawings, transition diagrams, constraint satisfaction, scripts, intelligent entities, case-based reasoning, planning and scheduling, and knowledge-based representations (rules, objects), techniques we have used with much success in previous projects.

Despite the high cost and limited size, systems based on materials such as silicon germanium or antimonides have produced adequate quantum efficiencies, dark current, full well capacity and frame rates such that military systems as well as commercial products are now available. Unfortunately high cost and limited size are inherent parameters in these devices. This is due to the high cost and limited surface area available of single crystal epitaxial wafers. These carrier substrates are limited to the diameter of the bulk crystal boule from which they are cut. Raw materials and processing costs for these wafers are extremely expensive and cost reduction cannot be viewed as realistic in these systems.  We propose an entirely new approach to imaging in the infrared range whose raw materials cost will be an order of magnitude lower than conventional systems. We expect quantum efficiencies rivaling or exceeding these traditional systems. Inherent in our approach is the ability to produce imaging systems that are not constrained by the size of a single crystal wafer but instead are scaleable to dimensions that can be measured in square feet. Using our approach detection out to 3 microns and beyond is expected.",

Rudziak, Principal Investigator\nMs. Elaine Drew, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG02-98ER82677\nAmount:  $74,991\n\nThe high energy physics community requires the development of superconducting wires for use in magnets generating magnetic fields of 15T and above.  Currently, Nb3Sn is the only commercially available superconductor capable of operating at such high fields.  Nb3Al is also  suitable for high field uses, and it has much greater strain tolerance than Nb3Sn; however, multifilament wire fabrication is much more difficult than for Nb3Sn.  This program seeks to develop a reliable fabrication route for Nb3Al multifilament wire.  The principal difficulty in fabricating multifilament jelly-roll Nb3Al conductor is obtaining sufficient inter-filament bonding within the composite to allow for reliable wire drawing.  This project will use warm hydrostatic extrusion to promote inter-filament bonding in multifilament Nb-Al jelly-roll composites.  In Phase I, Nb-Al jelly-roll monofilament wire will be fabricated and restacked into multifilament billets.  These billets will be hydrostatically extruded under varying conditions of temperature (up to 300\u00c2\u00bfC) and reduction (up to 16:1 by area).  Bonding in the composites will be evaluated, reaction heat treatments will be applied to the most fabricable composites, and  resulting superconducting properties will be measured.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  High performance, multifilamentary Nb3Al conductor would offer an attractive alternative to Nb3Sn in high energy physics particle accelerators and fusion machines.  Commercially, such a conductor would find application in nuclear magnetic resonance magnets that are currently fabricated using Nb3Sn wire.  The excellent strain tolerance of Nb3Al would make it feasible to use the react-and-wind technique for magnet fabrication, providing cost savings in manpower, equipment, and tooling._",

This in turn demands superconductors that have higher critical current densities at high fields than can typically be reached with NbTi.  Thus Nb3Sn conductors are the conductor of choice for the next generation dipole magnets (=15Tesla).  Further improvements in Nb3Sn conductors are necessary if this goal is to be met.  The objective of this research is to develop a high critical current density Nb3Sn conductor that uses the additions of dopants to the Nb3Sn phase.  The dopants will refine the Nb3Sn microstructure to reduce the average grain size and increase the grain boundary pinning force in order to reach higher critical current densities.  This project will investigate the feasibility of fabricating a Nb3Sn conductor by the powder-in-tube (PIT) method with additions of Zr as a dopant to control the microstructure during heat treatment.  A multifilamentary assembly will be drawn to sample size, heat treated, and then tested for superconducting properties.  Comparison of the Zr addition to a control sample will allow evaluation of the PIT method as a means of incorporating dopants into Nb3Sn conductors.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   The principle application of a higher performing Nb3Sn conductor would be in high field dipole magnets.  However, other uses would be found in magnetic confinement systems for fusion reactors and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) systems for chemical analysis._",

A low cost, robust, highly accurate photodiode bandpass detector is needed for irradiance measurements in this part of the solar spectrum.

A short wavelength absorbing, but electrically non-active, overlayer will be incorporated directly into the photodiode structure to create a narrow bandpass spectral response in the ultraviolet B region.  Such a device will have high quantum efficiency response within the bandpass and ~105 rejection of radiation outside the bandpass.

A major innovation is needed to produce power devices which can operate at high temperatures (400 \u00c2\u00bfC), withstand high voltages (> 500 V) and operate at high current levels without special cooling. SVT Associates proposes to meet this need with a heterojunction bipolar junction transistor (HBT) fabricated from Aluminum Gallium Nitride (AlGaN).  The basic electrical and thermal properties of Nitride materials are ideal for this application. The quality of existing P type GaN, however, is insufficient to make low leakage, low on resistance, high breakdown voltage GaN PN junctions. We propose to demonstrate improved quality P type GaN for these applications using an unique doping source in atomic nitrogen molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). If successful, the process will be used in Phase II to fabricate 1) GaN PN rectifiers and 2) AlGaN Heterojunction Bipolar transistors (HBT) for high power applications.",

The reaction of molten aluminum with iron in steel dies leads to soldering (a die casting defect) and damage to the die.  This project will develop an innovative compliant layer for the die\u00c2\u00bfs protective coating in order to provide the necessary thermomechanical and thermodynamic reliability.   A second thin hard coating will also be developed in Phase I to complete a two-layered coating and provide a direct solution to the problem of surface attack by molten metal.   To test the coating, samples will be subjected to thermal shock, and actual casting conditions of flowing metal will be simulated.   The samples will be examined metallographically for spalling, formation of intermetallics or other signs of coating wear.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   Die casting dies are expensive to fabricate.  Die surface modifications with innovative coatings could provide a simple and direct solution to die wear and damage.  Resilience in the face of molten metal attack is a prime requirement for large-scale economical commercialization of this precise casting technique._",

In order to be effective, there is a need for high temperature structural materials that can resist corrosion and oxidation.  The development of suitable coatings is needed.  Since thermomechanical and thermodynamic reliability are the required qualities of protective oxide coatings, an innovative barrier structure will be developed to prevent ionic diffusion.  It is expected that if applied directly on super alloy surfaces, this structure will help preserve the metal from oxidation for prolonged periods.  In Phase I, specially designed coatings will be applied on structural super alloy coupons and their oxidation resistance will be evaluated.  Thermal cycling tests will also be conducted.  The thickness of the coating structure and the processing parameters of the coating method will be optimized.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  A strongly adherent coating that is hard, ductile, wear, corrosion and oxidation resistant, with a relatively smooth surface structure, would be considered an enabling technology with huge commercial potential for many high performance energy and non energy-related applications.  An alumina coating structure that is strongly adherent on bio compatible substrates would also have application in the dentistry and orthopedic implant industries.  Alloys of titanium with an adherent and protective alumina coating should find many profitable applications in biomedical and chemical industries.\n\n_",

Since joint failure can lead to run away conditions with serious consequences, the reliability of joints in fusion reactors must be guaranteed.  This requires innovative engineering design concepts to reduce the stress in the joints.  Brush structures are desirable because stress singularities are virtually eliminated.  The brush concept reduces not only the thermal strain mismatch but also avoids the stress singularity found at the edge of the interface.   This project will develop an innovative processing method that will allow rapid fabrication of a novel tungsten brush structure.  In Phase I, the brush structure will be fabricated from tungsten rods and a high thermal conductivity, high strength copper alloy, using an energy efficient approach.  The fabricated brush will be subjected to thermal cycling and other tests.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The ability to successfully fabricate a brush structure by utilizing a low energy method to bond copper alloy with a bundle of refractory metal rods, such as tungsten, should be commercially applicable to the bonding of other dissimilar materials.\n_",

The problem of potentially high magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) pressure drop experienced by the lithium as it flows through the high magnetic field of the tokamak must be resolved.  This project will apply thin coatings of four insulating ceramics on vanadium alloy test foils using  two different techniques.  The strongly adherent and thermodynamically stable coatings are expected to be effective in their functionality.  The structure of the resulting coated test foils will be evaluated, and their compatibility with liquid lithium assessed.  Phase I will evaluate electron metallographic structure, x-ray analysis of coating structure and electrical resistivity at room temperature.

There is no commercial system available that satisfies these requirements, and most users either compromise or develop ad hoc custom solutions.  This project will combine FASTCAMAC with Gigabit Ethernet to make a high speed crate controller.  This will provide up to 60 megabytes per second data acquisition for personal computers and workstations.  Gigabit Ethernet will be the communication link to the host, for both control and data transfer.  The resulting crate controller will take advantage of low cost PC and workstation hardware and software and will not require custom designed interfaces to each host computer.   The design approach will be studied to verify the feasibility of the project, and the performance possible with standard network driver software will be estimated.  A system level prototype of the controller will be constructed with standard components to study the architecture and understand the software requirements of the host computer system.

In September of 1997 a series of evaluation tests for three basic algorithms were conducted at Lincoln Laboratory over a range atmospherically scaled to the Airborne Laser scenario.  The data showed that two major problems existed with the tracking algorithms, these were (1)scintillation was making calculation of tilt very difficult, and (2) the false tilt due to scintillation was being coupled back into system via the track loop control of the steering mirror.  The test series at Lincoln Laboratories provide a large library of imaging data taken under scaled conditions of turbulence and scintillation.  This project will use that data and develop new tracking algorithms and track loop designs to work under scintillated conditions.  Several algorithms will be developed and completed, these are (1) spatial and temporal averaging routines, (2) a Kalman filter tracking algorithm, and (3) correlation algorithms.

This microfabrication method (sometimes called binary optics technology) is time-consuming, costly, sensitive to alignment errors, and only produces a less-than-ideal DOE.  Other major problems, which appear to be unique with InSb and the multi-mask process, are polymer buildup and substrate fracturing in subsequent etch levels.  Since these do not appear to be problems with a single etch process, a new process is needed which achieves fabrication of high-efficiency DOEs with only a single mask and single etch step.  This proposed effort will investigate the application of gray scale mask technology to etching high-efficiency DOEs in InSb and InAs substrates.  New processes appropriate for gray scale masks, including photoresist exposure/development and RIE gas chemistries will be developed.  Unique new methods of fabricating gray scale masks will also be investigated.  These new processes will be used to fabricate continuous profile DOEs and refractive micro-optical components in III-V semiconductors such as InSb and InAs.  BENEFITS:  Processes developed under this effort will greatly benefit the production of commercial FLIR and IR detector systems.  Potential commercial devices could include radiation hardened focal plane arrays, laser optical limiters for night vision devices, filters and elements for advanced staring FLIR systems, high efficiency/low cost night vision illuminators and spotters, IR detectors, and various applications within the micro-machining industry.",

The coating provides a high level of EM shielding, including magnetic shielding, EMP shielding and powers line filtering. The woven mesh will form a flexible shield with similar properties.

Unlike conventional magnetic shielding approaches, which rely on high permeability layers, this coating uses the interaction between a good conductor and the magnetic layer to produce the high absorption.  This results in a low cost film with less sensitivity to handling and improved high field performance.  Since the wire consists primarily of copper, it retains much of the ductility of copper and can be bent or flexed.  Samples of the mesh will be fabricated and measured during the Phase I and the ability of the wire to withstand flexing will be verified.

Intercommunication headsets currently employed by tank crewmen expose wearers to unacceptably high levels of background noise when the communication system microphone is keyed and a person is talking. This noise induces fatigue in the wearers, decreases job performance and efficiency, increases perceived operational workload, and could lead to permanent hearing loss. This noise also masks incoming speech and other non-verbal audio signals essential to mission success and crew safety.  Our proposed research introduces new technology that will significantly reduce noise and improve intelligibility using a combination of modular hardware components and advanced noise reduction signal processing techniques. These include: 1) an adaptive beamforming multi-microphone array that will increase the speech SNR and reduce noise entering the headset through the voice input, 2) an optimized ANR earphone, which will increase the ANR attenuation bandwidth to include higher portions of the speech range, 3) improved passive earcups and seals made from low-frequency passive sound absorbing materials, which will decrease low-frequency noise entering the system through the earcups and seals, and 4) improved speech filtering using wavelet transforms, spectral subtraction, or others, which will improve speech signal extraction from noise. The overall benefit to the U.S. Army from this combined approach will be modular hardware and software components that can be readily integrated into a variety of headset applications to reduce noise-induced fatigue, reduce hearing loss, improve operational performance, increase comfort and above all, improve the safety of U.S. Army personnel.

        "abstract": "The U.S. Army depends on shooting accuracy for effectiveness on the battlefield, yet the factors that affect accuracy, including body sway, recoil, recoil anticipation, flinching, and trigger pull tension,are not well understood.  Currently there is a need for a system that can measure these factors and construct a firing analysis that details the effects on shooting accuracy from these factors.  Synetics proposes a shooting analysis system that takes advantage of low-cost, very light rate sensors to measure shooter motion.  This technique combined with a CCD camera, a laser pointing device, and wireless communication will yield a detailed profile of shooter motion during the firing process.  This information will be graphically displayed in real time to the operator via developed software and graphics tools.  This system will help improve shooter accuracy and possibly contribute to a new long-term approach to shooting instruction.  BENEFITS:  Potential post applications for the shooting analysis system include extensive target range applications for military and police use. Also, a version of the system may be used for analysis in the recreational shooting industry.",

This energy is useful because it is omni-directional, and it propagates well with little absorption.  With sufficient energy, the resulting infrasonic waves can be disabling or lethal.  Synetics proposes an approach toward developing infrasonic waves that can ultimately be incorporated into future man-portable small arms weapon systems.  This approach utilizes modernized pneumatic technology which produces an extremely high-powered ultrasonic source.  The resulting frequency generated is precisely controlled such that the desired high power infrasound frequency can be generated at the target by beating two focused ultrasonic sources.

        "abstract": "Delivery and installation of software onto Navy platforms typically requires that an  installation team travels to the site and physically accesses the target computer  system. In an environment of smaller budgets, this expensive and time-consuming  process has become impractical.  The Navy needs a system whereby a Software  Support Agency (SSA) can transfer software directly from its offices to shipboard  computers, regardless of the ship's location.  SYNETICS proposes to satisfy this need by designing a General-purpose,  Automated Delivery, Installation, and Validation (GADIVA) tool that will  support the Configuration Management (CM) processes of both the SSA and the  ship. SYNETICS  will use an existing satellite link to the ship while targeting the  more accessible Global Broadcasting System (GBS), available within the next  couple of years. SSA-resident GADIVA will transmit an encrypted and verifiable  software package that is archived by the shipboard GADIVA for installation  under ship's control.  Installation will be a cooperative effort between the target  computer system and the shipboard GADIVA. SSA CM databases will be  available through GADIVA using Relational Data Base Management System  (RDBMS)-based Internet browser technology, allowing remote database queries,  software requests, and delivery/installation status reporting.  These capabilities  will make GADIVA an effective delivery tool for diverse programs.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I program will test a solution processing scheme for fabricating shaped structural components, such as sheets and tubes, from a class of rigid-chain lyotropic liquid crystalline polymers. This class of polymers includes rigid-rod polymers such as poly(p-phenylene benzobisthiazole) (PBZT) and extended-chain polymers such as poly(p-phenylene terephthalarnide) (PPTA). These polymers usually do not melt upon heating to their degradation temperature at approximately 500\u00c2\u00bfC. Therefore, normally, they are extruded and coagulated from their liquid crystalline solutions into high-strength, high-modulus fibers. In this Phase I research program, the rigid-chain lyotropic liquid crystalline polymers will be processed into monolithic, shaped structural components via a thermally reversible phase transformation of their concentrated solutions. The thermal formation of the structural components can be carried out by conventional extrusion and molding techniques used for thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers. The highly anisotropic liquid crystalline solutions allow the shaped structural components to be processed with significant molecular orientation, giving rise to self-reinforcing mechanical properties. These structural components are expected to have the essential thermal and mechanical properties for stringent applications at both cryogenic and elevated temperatures.",

(SPA) proposes to develop a semi-active recoil damper system for the Apache AH-64 helicopter nose chain gun based on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) magnetorheological (MR) fluid and digital control technologies. This retro-fittable recoil system will allow for substantial improvements in the accuracy of the 30mm chain gun during high rates of fire by dissipating recoil forces, which excite the flexural modes of the gun barrel and gun mount structure, thereby causing dispersion of rounds at the target.  SPA will exploit a semi-active nonlinear controller, which will remove energy from the system, for suppression of gun recoil forces (primarily 10Hz).  During the proposed Phase I effort, a full scale prototype system will be designed and built based on the prototype Rheonetics(tm) MR damper by Lord Corp., and integrated with an Apache 30mm gun test apparatus in collaboration with the U.S. Army Advanced Drives and Weapon Stabilization Lab (ADAWS), U.S. Army Armament Research Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC), at Picatinny Arsenal, N.J.  BENEFITS:  Real-time, on-line, recoil damping augmentation of fire systems will increase the lethality of air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons systems by reducing the number of rounds required for a specific target kill.

In Phase I we will develop a process and evaluate the relevant tools for data base generation that will allow average military users to quickly and conveniently prepare parachute simulator visual scenes and wind fields representing realistic situations for mission planning and rehearsal fidelity.  The key design criteria are: a) 48hour data turnaround; b) worldwide coverage, c) geodetic and meteorological accuracy; d) real time simulation utility.  In Phase II, we will integrate these tools into a working ensemble, including any necessary automation or          software, create terrain-correlated empirical wind models, and develop a complete syllabus for training users in the database generation process.",

Frequency domain techniques will be applied to relevant pilot inputs to estimate the significant parameters that influence pilot ratings when performing high gain, closed-loop tasks.  Specific techniques include the fast-Fourier transform that will be used to generate real time power spectral densities (PSD) of the pilot's input.  The PSD will then be used to estimate relevant parameters including pilot gain, crossover and cutoff frequency, and pilot lead.  This effort will lead to software and testing techniques that will integrate with existing simulators and flight test facilities, remotely-piloted vehicle ground stations, and future uninhabited combat air vehicle operator stations.

The error characteristics of the accelerometers, chiefly the bias stability and broadband noise, limit the accuracy and hence the application of the resulting accelerometer-based multi-sensor inertial navigation systems (AMS-INS). The technical challenges are first to predict the fundamental limitations using detailed error analysis, and then to design the hardware and embedded software algorithms needed to maximize the available performance. The proposed algorithms include robust statistical estimation, online identification of bias error terms using Kalman filtering or neural networks, and self-initialization of the rate estimates using measurements of centripetal acceleration. The Phase I effort will include a simulation test bed for AMS-INS development, single axis measurements, and both analytical and Monte Carlo error analyses. A hardware and real-time software design using 15 accelerometers, temperature sensor, and an embedded DSP controller will be performed in the Phase I Option.",

The formulation of this simulator represents a single instantiation of a modular simulator concept that we conceived in 1995.  We denote the helicopter simulator, the VolksSim 2000, thus stressing its economical aspects and planned widespread appeal.  The~VolksSim 2000 will be driven by a dual-processor SMP (Symmetric MultiProcessor), Windows NT platform.  Hosted on this will be a helicopter aero-model, soft CRT displays, a headtracking application, and hooks for expansion in Phase II.  A single-seat cockpit shell (reconfigurable for Phase II expansion) with appropriate helicopter controls will be the working-end of the simulator.  A top-end terrain modeling system will provide the user with unlimited scenario creativity. All operator actions, both continuous and discrete control and mode selections, will be monitored and sensed to support human performance experiments, and they will also be for time-tagged for post-test data analysis.  Specific Phase II expansion concepts are proposed herein; a formal Phase II plan will be developed during Phase I using customer inputs. When delivered at the 6-month point, the VolksSim 2000 helicopter simulator will provide immediate research value to the user at Ft. Rucker, AL.  Human performance data will be able to be collected and analyzed by the sponsor during the Phase I to Phase II transition.",

Charge storage capacities for these materials will exceed those of nickel, cobalt or manganese oxides.  During the Phase I program T/J Technologies new cathode materials will be used in conjunction with polymer electrolytes developed by SAFT. Cells will be tested to determine the charge capacity, energy density, efficiency, cyclability and Li-ion diffusivity.  Our performance target is 150 mAh/gr for more than 50 cycles.  We will supplement these electrochemical measurements with structural and compositional analysis to verify that lithium can be reversibly inserted and de-inserted without extensive physical or chemical degradation.  During Phase II we will produce additional electrode compounds that should offer even higher capacities.  These materials will be optimized for use with the best available polymer electrolytes.

The proposed in-line electro-optic modulator has many advantages over other modulator technologies. The self-pigtailed fiber-optic half block provides low-loss, high throughput input/output coupling to the network, and the ELO semiconductor thin c film provide an efficient, stable electro-optic modulation of the optical beam. The in-line modulator employs a continuous optical fiber with a partially exposed propagation mode. The epilayer is bonded to the fiber half block by Van der Waals force. Because there is no fiber breakage, no epoxy, and no organic materials : used in packaging, the modulator will have a maximum mechanical stability which will be particularly useful in aviation and space applications. This effort will investigate the feasibility of using the proposed technologies to fabricate a family of high performance and high stability in-line modulators with insertion loss down to ~t dB.

Aerosols, in particular, are a likely means of delivering the potential biohazards.  Analyzing these aerosols rapidly and accurately is critical to successful defense, and can involve several levels of physical and biochemical analysis.  A key biochemical component of bacteria and viruses is their nucleic acid composition because multiple copies of a toxin or viral agent will be produced from the genetic information.  Unfortunately, current methods and instrumentation to detect specific nucleic acid sequences are too slow, labor intensive, and require multiple instruments for processing and analysis. This Phase I proposal describes an innovative RNA methodology to isolate the target microorganisms, prepare the ribosomal RNA, and detect it with fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probes.  The method is designed to be completed in 30 minutes or less, and can be integrated into a compact, automated instrument suitable for demanding field applications.

        "abstract": "Small numbers of biological particles can be a serious threat as warfare agents and health hazards due to their ability to rapidly multiply.  Therefore, accurate and rapid identification of low biohazard concentrations would be useful for early battlefield warning systems, cleanup and surveillance of production facilities, and frontline medical diagnoses.  Current methods are not accurate due to reaction kinetics, sensitivity limits and false positives caused by environmental interferants.  The facilities that come the closest to routine identification of very low numbers of biological particles in environmental samples are the clinical and forensic laboratories that apply a succession of sample processing steps.  Building upon these successful but equipment and time-intensive methods, this proposal describes a compact, integrated system of advanced filtration, concentration, antibody assays and long wavelength fluorescence detection designed to achieve accurate and rapid single particle identification.  In order to demonstrate commercial feasibility, the Phase I technical objectives are: a) filter and concentrate a narrow size range of particles, b) fluorescently detect a specific, rapid (10-15 minute) sandwich immunoassay in a small volume reaction cell, and c) design the necessary improvements for a fieldable instrument to be fabricated and tested within approximately 2 years.  BENEFITS: The benefits from successful development would be the ability to identify biological substances at extremely low concentrations within approximately 15 minutes or less. commercial applications for this single particle identifier would include early stage medical diagnosis, food processing, and environmental monitoring for herbicides and pesticides.  The instrumentation could also be applied to forensic identification of controlled biological agents, or industrial safety monitoring when hazardous or regulated biochemistry is being performed.",

The effects of turbulence chemistry interactions can have a pronounced effect on the ignition process,  particularly for supersonic combustion applications where the residence time for fuel and air mixing is limited.  Semi-empirical models have little hope for accurately predicting the ignition process due to the highly non-linear nature of the chemical source terms, therefore a computational methodology based on the physics of the flow is preferred.  In Phase I, efforts will focus of 1) Development of a Monte Carlo based algorithm for solving the evolution PDF transport equation for supersonic combusting flows,  2) Comparison of the evolution PDF results with newly designed assumed PDF formulations, and 3) validation of the models with available experimental data for simple geometries.

Tao Systems' Constant Voltage Anemometer (CVA) instrumentation system will be adapted for under-water applications to obtain high sensitivity and high dynamic response at low sensor currents. The low power dissipation in hot-films operated with CVA will significantly reduce or eliminate bubble formation, as well as corrosion causing electrolysis associated with conventional techniques. The high signal-to-noise ratio of CVA, coupled with large bandwidth, even at low sensor currents will  eliminate most of the problems encountered by conventional anemometers in under-water  applications. Furthermore, since the power dissipated by hot-film sensors in the CVA-mode of  operation is linearly proportional to the voltage output (and not to the square of the measured output voltage, as in constant temperature anemometer), an order of magnitude reduction in  measurement error will result with the proposed innovation. The feasibility of the proposed approach will be demonstrated during Phase I by conducting tests on an instrumented model in a  water tunnel.",

Lack of GaN and AIN substrates for homoepitaxy limits the development of electronic devices based on III-V nitrides. TDI has demonstrated that thin (~0.5 Sun) high quality GaN layers can be grown on silicon carbide wafers by hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE). These structures, consisting of a thin GaN layer on SiC wafers, are called GaN/SiC epitaxial wafers. It was shown that GaN/SiC epitaxial wafers are good substrates for subsequent GaN homoepitaxial growth. SiC, as initial substrate material, provides excellent heat removal from device structure, gives cleaving possibility, and allows one to develop electronic devices with vertical current-flow geometry. Recently, we applied HVPE technique to AIN and AlGaN growth on SiC wafers. These results open the opportunity to develop AlGaN/SiC epitaxial wafers with A1N concentration ranging from 0 to 100%. In this case, composition of AlGaN epitaxial wafer will be controlled to minimize stress in the desired device structure. Another breakthrough has been achieved on HVPE growth of insulating GaN. The goal of Phase I is to prove the concept and demonstrate GaN/SiC, AlN/SiC, and Al0.5GaO.5N/SiC epitaxial wafers. We will demonstrate both conducting GaN/SiC epitaxial wafers and GaN/SiC epitaxial wafers with highly resistive GaN grown on semi-insulating SiC substrates. Test samples will be delivered. In Phase II, we plan to develop a multi-wafer production process for 2-inch AlGaN/SiC epitaxial wafers with reduced dislocation density.",

The goal of the Phase I project is to prove this concept and demonstrate a 41 mm diameter 6H-SiC and 4H-SiC wafers with average micropipe density less than 5 per cm2. We will also investigate how to apply this technology for larger SiC wafers. Test samples will be delivered.

The HVPE technique is a well-established, relatively cheap method to grow thick layers of GaN on sapphire and silicon carbide substrates.  This epitaxial method provides high growth rate sufficient to obtain quasi bulk material.  Our recent experiments show that high quality, thick AlN epitaxial layers can be grown by HVPE.  AlN free-standing platelets have been obtained.  Preliminary experiments indicate that grown AlN is transparent in the wavelength region from 2 to 6 microns.  These results open the opportunity to develop large area AlN high quality infrared window material.  The goal of the Phase I is to prove the concept and demonstrate free-standing 1 mm thick AlN platelets with a lateral size at least 15x15 sq.mm.  We will measure physical properties of grown AlN, including optical absorption in the wavelength region from 1 to 10 microns.  Test samples will be delivered.  In the Phase II, we will focus on the development of multi-wafer HVPE growth process for AlN deposition.

Two types of phenol monomers containing polyether or perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acid segments para to the phenolic function will be synthesized.  The former will be obtained by partial O-alkylation of hydroquinone, while the latter will be prepared by ring-opening of perfluoropropane sultone by 4-lithionanisole.  Enzymatic polymerization of these monomers will be carrier out and both resulting polymers (I and II) will be lithiated prior to building a lithium laboratory cell.  Another polymer (III) which contains both polyether and perfluorosulfonic acid moieties, will be prepared by O-alkylation of Polymer-II.  The polyether segments will provide increased solubility and permit generation of an ion-conducting region for formation of a Li ion complex.  The perfluoroalkylsulfonic acid segments in Polymer-Ii will reduce the basicity of phenoxide ion, while contributing to stabilization of lithium complex. The SPEs derived from these polymers should exhibit high ionic conductivity and improved mechanical properties.",

Present state of the art batteries utilize metal hydrides, containing 1-1.1 wt % hydrogen. Development efforts are in progress in many laboratories to develop nickel/metal hydride batteries which have a very long cycle life. Technochem Company has developed a metal hydride alloy whose crystal lattice parameters remain invariant before and after subjecting the alloy to hydriding and dehydriding cycles This alloy potentially can yield a high stable capacity and extremely long cycle life. By developing these types of reversible metal alloy hydrides of > 1.3 wt% hydrogen storage capacity and appropriate battery design and engineering, the energy density of this system can be enhanced to >100 Wh/kg and 300 Wh/L, meeting the DoD requirements for many applications in communications and man-portable electronic devices. The proposed Phase I program will (i) research novel metal hydride materials with > 1.35 wt% hydrogen capacity, (ii) establish reversibility and stability and (ii) demonstrate at the cell prototype level superior nickel/metal hydride battery characteristics.  The Phase II program will involve design, development, fabrication, and testing of battery prototypes for the identified DoD applications.  BENEFITS:  Nickel/metal hydride batteries with performance characteristics of 100 Wh/kg, 240 Wh/L and 200 W/kg will have DoD applications for robotic vehicles and communications. The commercial applications will include power sources for tools, uninterrupted power supplies, and remote telecommunications.

This places highly demanding requirements on the cryocooler, its integration into the spacecraft, and subjects the cooled assembly to unwanted disturbances.  Since the spacecraft radiator is usually remote from the cooled assemblies, a heavy conductive strap or heat pipe is required to transfer cryocooler heat dissipation, which added weight and decreases the cryocooler efficiency and reliability.Technology Applications, Inc. has defined a unique cryocooler interface system in which the cryocooler is located remote from the cooled elements.  This Interface System greatly simplifies the cooling system integration and virtually eliminates all cryocooler disturbances.  It also provides contract temperature cooling under variable loads, cooling large area and/or distributed elements, will accommodate cooling across a gimbal axis, is insensitive to gravity level, offers ease of redundancy, and interfaces with most types of cryocoolers.The Interface System requirements and their flowdown to the component level will be established.  A preliminary design will be generated and optimized through system level parametric and detailed component analyses.  The concept feasibility will then be demonstrated by testing of a brad-board model.",

Data from these sensors would be used to control processing in near real time, to accelerate development of new materials systems, and to enable the development of a virtual materials processing environment, a goal that will greatly reduce both the cost and time needed to develop new materials systems.  Few sensors currently exist that can provide the kind of information needed.  X-ray sensors offer a vast improvement over current in situ sensor techniques.  Recent advances in high energy high resolution x-ray generators coupled with modern advanced photo detecting systems have made real-time data acquisition during Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) a laboratory reality.During Phase I effort, the feasibility of x-ray sensors for in situ, real-time process control of magnetron sputter deposition of thin films will be demonstrated.  This will be achieved by delineating relationships between microscopic film properties and deposition conditions.  In addition, one design will be prepared to adapt appropriate sensors for measuring x-ray reflectivity and fluorescence to in situ measurements, and a second design for a heated sample stage and goniomete will be developed.",

        "abstract": "Filament wound composite structures are being increasingly used in tactical rocket motorcase applications to reduce weight and enhance system performance. Conventional fabrication methods for composite motorcase structures are time-consuming and often require expensive tooling. This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) proposal addresses the development and evaluation of rapid, low-cost manufacturing and processing techniques for filament wound composite motorcase structures. Specific areas to be investigated as part of the proposed Phase I feasibility demonstration include: (1) preimpregnated tow materials, (2) rapid electron beam curing processes, (3) low cost tooling designs and (4) back-to-back winding of full diameter opening motorcase structures. Each of these areas will be evaluated and compared through material/process trade studies and manufacturing feasibility investigations in order to select the most promising and technically feasible materials and process conditions for further development and demonstration as part of a follow-on Phase II program. Representative filament wound pressure vessels will be fabricated and hydrostatically pressure tested to compare the perforrnance of structures fabricated using the selected materials and processing techniques.  BENEFITS:  The primary application of the proposed research is filament wound rocket motorcases and launch tubes. Other applications for the proposed research include filament wound composite structures for the automotive, ship, aircraft, spacecraft and sporting goods industries.",

        "abstract": "Modern situational awareness is supported by a multiplicity of sensors.  These provide target information over spatial scales from a few square meters to hundreds of square kilometers.  When combined with geographic and other environmental information, the volume of data available to commanders is extensive.  This produces challenges in the effective and efficient fusion of all relevant information for maximum utility.  Computer architectures offer the throughput to handle large volumes of data.  However, automated algorithms are typically ineffective at data fusion, due to their specific and rigid reasoning structures.  Hence, the reliance on biologic systems (i.e. human analysts) that employ general and flexible reasoning.  Unfortunately, biologic systems are easily overloaded unless data are heavily filtered, decreasing their utility.  This program proposes combining general/flexible biologic reasoning with digital computer speed/throughput in automated algorithms.  These algorithms fuse spatial target and environment information to perform specific functions, but are not scenario or target specific.  Hierarchical systems of fuzzy and crisp rules are employed to perform the processing.  Given the data representations and environmental information supported, commercial Geographic Information Systems (GISs) are employed as the framework for such spatial reasoning modules.  Current and enhanced GIS functionality to support generic spatial reasoning will be examined.  BENEFITS:  This research will develop a military spatial reasoning capability which fuses target and environment information, but is not scenario or target specific.  Examples include path planning, mobility assessments and unit specialization/generalization.  Given the military feasibility of generic spatial reasoning, the concepts can then be applied to commercial uses such as disaster damage assessment, wildlife preservation and law enforcement.",

        "abstract": "The detection and tracking of slow to moderate speed ground moving targets with a foliage penetration radar operating on a UAV such as a Global Hawk will require an endo-clutter signal processing capability.  A concept is proposed that utilizes a suite of both conventional algorithms and innovative techniques to form the requisite signal processing architecture.  Among the algorithms in the proposed architecture are displaced phase center antenna (DPCA) processing, polar format processing, complex indicated angle (CIA) processing, frame-by-frame subtraction processing using clutter return estimates from SAR map data, Hough transform processing and contextual target tracking.  DPCA and CIA will allow the system to operate with signal-to-clutter ratios of less than 0 dB.  The GMTI concept that is proposed is designed to work simultaneously with a high resolution SAR mapping mode.  The concept could also be used in a space-based radar or in a ground-based intrusion detection system.  The GMTI algorithms and system architecture will be developed during the Phase I program.  During the follow-on Phase 2 effort, the signal processing architecture will be formalized and installed under a Khoros-based system such as the AFRL/Rome RLSTAP/ASSET algorithm development tools.  Simulated data will first be used to validate the software.  Pseudo-real-time processing would then be demonstrated using data collected by P-band radars such as the U.S. Navy P-3 UWB SAR, GeoSAR, AIRSAR and the Lockheed Martin ATD system.",

        "abstract": "Interceptor missiles have traditionally used PN (Proportional Navigation) for terminal homing guidance. However, modern threats have become faster, more stealthy, and more maneuverable. Terminal homing missile performance requirements have also become more stringent, such as for direct-hit capability. These requirements have led to the development of newer guidance laws to improve terminal homing performance. These newer guidance laws typically use additional information (e.g., target acceleration) not required for PN. The state estimators providing this information must produce accurate estimates, otherwise the performance of the newer guidance laws can degrade to the point where there performance is worse than conventional PN guidance. The accuracy and robustness of the state estimators have been some of the limiting factors for improving terminal homing performance via the use of newer guidance laws.     TSC is proposing the development of robust and adaptive state estimators based on the Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) algorithm for use in onboard terminal homing guidance. The IMM algorithm is a self-adjusting variable bandwidth filter, which makes it robust and adaptive to target maneuvers. TSC will develop a six degree-of-freedom missile simulation, develop the IMM estimators, implement a newer guidance law utilizing these state estimates, and conduct a series of Monte Carlo simulations to quantify the performances of the IMM estimators against various types of targets and maneuvers.",

        "abstract": "The detection of low velocity targets by a high PRF surveillance radar such as the E-3 AWASCS  is exacerbated by the two different clutter return phenomena:  the J-Hook return and the Horseshoe return.  The J-Hook return is observed primarily when the antenna points downward.  In these geometries the clutter screen below the antenna may not adequately suppress the elevation sidelobe return, which allows the J-Hook return to become strong.The Horseshoe return, which is viturally always present, is believed to be caused by reflections from the AWACS radome.  The Horseshoe return tends to track near the aircraft's nadir point.The proposed research will provide greater insight into the causes of these two clutter returns.  Also, the algorithms that will be investigated to mitigate these effects are described.  The algorithms, which vary considerably in complexity operate at various levels including: 1) censoring the clutter retruns in the CFAR map, 2) multiple slant adaptive processing and 3) both single and multiple channel adaptive antenna processing.",

The proposed research will identify the sources of interference that affect SARs operating in different frequency bands, quantify the effects of this interference on the SAR image and develop (to a first level) concepts that can negate the intereference. The techniques for rejecting the interference include space-time adaptive processing, adaptive time gating and frequency domain nulling, coherent signal subtraction and monopulse processing/cell censoring.  Also investigated will be interpolation techniques to restore the portions of the signal lost due to the gating and filtering of the interference.A matrix will be generated that summarizes the impact of each interference source on the SAR's performance, the interference rejection required, the ability of the jammer negation techniques to achieve these requistite levels and the cost of incorporating each negation concept.

Combined with off-boresight tracking, the technique can also reject angle-deception jammers such as cross-eye, cross polarizaiton, blinking, and terrain bounce.  The simultaneous use of frequency agility will further enhance the EP technique. The technique, denoted Beam-Agility Target Modulation and Discrimination (BATMAD), exploits the rapid beam switiching capability of the modern ESA to modulate target and jammer signals.  Using unique jammer discrimination processing in the sum and difference channels, the signals are sorted and classified.  Target signals are processed, while jammer signals are rejected.In Phase I, TSC will investigate the feasibility of the BATMAD concept, with the support of Raytheon Systems Company.

The hybrid approach was driven by the desire to provide the Army with a method to rapidly convert large volumes of instructional material supported by tutorial dialog.  This method uses Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) which statistically reduces material into a very compact knowledge representation.  LSA will support normal tutorial dialog, such as. evaluating student responses and answering factbased questions.  We provide the mixed-initiative in-depth dialog through an NLP approach.  We have an easy to use template-driven authoring tool for the conceptual knowledge base.  Continuous speech recognition is provided, as well as a talking head tutor with realistic facial animation that is synchronized with a text-to-speech synthesis system.  Every component is already operational and the concept for integration is described in this proposal.  The final proposed tutor is available to the government for free distribution and requires no separate purchase agreements for any of the components.  The proposed hybrid tutor can be delivered over the Internet and will have a reasonable footprint (memory, storage) and speed on a Pentium in Windows NT.  BENEFITS: The benefit to the Army is that large volumes of instructional material can be rapidly converted into a realistic, simulated learning environment delivered on a PC or over the Internet for self-development and just-in-time training.  All of the components are easily extensible for foreign language training.Offering a realistic task environment in which the trainee can interact naturally through speech with a simulated tutor along with an authoring capability provides this product an edge over existing commercial computer-based training and assessment products.",

Army Near Term Digital Radio (NTDR) stations.  The goal is to permit direct communications between high-speed digital (Group 4) fax machines, television surveillance equipment, digital telephones and other ISDN equipment over the NDTR network.  Tele-SyS, Inc. will use commercial software protocol stacks and evaluation hardware to minimize development efforts and ensure reliable performance. Radio frequency communications over the NTDR will utilize the ethernet port provided by the NTDR.  The ISDN/NTDR interface devices to be provided by Tele-SyS, Inc. for this purpose will be called ISDN/Ethernet Conversion Modules (I/ECM's).  In addition to demonstrating functional connectivity between two NTDR terminals using I/ECM's, the Phase I project will demonstrate digital data transfer and real-time full-duplex digital voice transmission.  Deliverable hardware will consist of two I/SCM's, and the transmission and protocol analysis hardware which is necessary to debug problems and quantify transmission performance.  Deliverable software will be the software embedded in I/SCM's.  Deliverable documentation will be a user's manual to include installation instructions for the I/ECM's and operational training instructions.  BENEFITS:  The principal benefits of this project will be expanded functionality and improved communication reliability of the NTDR network due to use of commercial ISDN hardware.  This will permit real-time audio, video, and text communication between battlefield vehicles.  Commercial applications will focus on communication of ISDN equipment over existing industrial and military ethernets.",

This project will apply a direct micromechanical simulation technique using boundary elements to model the growth and interaction of multiple cracks in granular rock under indentation, hydraulic, and in-situ loads.

Significant to the research is the ability to perform Natural Language Speech (NLS) recognition and synthesis in both a high and variable noise environment.  The noise environment may contain varying amounts of non-stationary, stationary and impulse components or even competing speech.  A practical small self-contained and portable module containing the necessary micro-processor and software plus standard connectors for speech enabling other automated computer systems wiil perform speech recognition and voice response in real-time.  The goal NLS module for high noise environments would also contain a display and acoustic man-machine interface for application flexibility.  The research of multiple noise abatement and speaker voice tracking technologies is implemented in the system together with state-of-the-art speech recognition, synthesis and natural language understanding.  The combination of these emerging technologies are expected to be very resistant to accuracy degradation caused by both continuous and impulse noises present in military armored vehicles and on factory floors, as well as in the presence of other voices.

Ultrasonic guided waves (GW) are one of the most defect sensitive NDE methods known, and they can probe at large (over 20ft in composites) from the inspected area.  By using embedded fiber optics as receivers the acoustic guided wave passage is sensed internal to the part under inspection.

        "abstract": "High power transducer boots must undergo one of the most stringent stress profiles of any underwater encapsulation.  Added to the hydrostatic and vibratory fatigue stresses are the problems that come with moving frictional contact - abrasion and heating.  Abrasion resistant materials are typically not heat resistant, and fatigue resistant materials are not good at sustaining heat, abrasion, and wear processes.  The solution proposed is a multi-layer material built on a fatigue resistant base boot, with a heat or abrasion resistant liner impregnated with friction reducing additives.  By using a dual or tri-material approach the benefits of the most resistant materials to a given stress type are combined into a single transducer boot.  The challenge is to combine these in a way that maintains boot reliability - this means chemically bonding the laminates to insure an integral boot.  Bonds between materials so diverse are difficult to achieve in a transducer environment, and strategies are outlined which should prove bonding feasibility in Phase I.  Phase I will culminate with the installation of three prototype boots on scale slotted cylinder transducers.  Phase I Option I takes the booted transducers to Lake Seneca, NY for a fully submerged endurance test to demonstrate boot life enhancement over current designs.",

        "abstract": "The proposed effort will examine continuous AE monitoring of fatigue in aircraft, where uncertainty about fatigue damage threatens to retire aircraft.  Noise levels and other common AE issues have been addressed by others, but fundamental limitations of commercial systems, such as weight and EMI interference, continue to hamper extensive use of AE monitoring on aircraft.  During Phase I, TRI/Austin will team with Boeing.  SPEC, and Felicitv Group to create a smart, single cable AE sensor system that processes AE waveforms at the sensor.  This will greatly reduce the amounts of data that commercial systems must transfer via cables into a central computer.  This reduction will allow a single cable to monitor many AE sensors while reducing the weight, heat generation and size of the computer.  Processing data at the sensor will allow heavy, EMI susceptible pre-amps to be removed from the AE sensors.  The smart sensor could be smaller than conventional sensor/preamp combinations because the chips needed to implement smart sensors are commercially available, small, and lightweight.  Phase I tasks will include: smart sensor development;  fiber optic data transfer system implementation; adapting software; and optimizing ssystem performance versus commercial AE equipment.",

The composite material will be non-water soluble, and will not show significant degradation and will be able to form water tight seals over a 10 year service life.  The Phase I project will determine the feasibility of replacing the metallic launch tube with a composite material and will consist of defining the design requirements, conducting a composite materials survey and evaluation, conducting a design study, fabricating subscale test articles, determining activation energies of candidate materials and preparing an accelerated life test plan for the composite launch tube.",

Conductive fillers will be investigated for incorporation into the matrix resins.  Various conductive loading levels will be considered.  In the proposed heat activated system, the gap-filler material is briefly heated prior to application.  This initial heat activation liberates a latent curing agent, which will remain active after delivery to the substrate.  Cure will continue after application to the substrate, and complete cure will be achieved in approximately 5 minutes to 24 hours depending on catalyst concentration.  Density of the gap-fillers will be minimized in order to achieve weight savings on aircraft.

        "abstract": "Hoses are critical to the operation of hydraulic, power train, and auxiliary machinery aboard ship and in industrial applications.  This project will develop a hose inspection tool to economically and practically assess hose health in place.  Reliable inspection of hoses reduces maintenance costs while decreasing the rate of hose failures and related accidents. Microwave methods for hose nondestructive evaluation (NDE) can identify critical hose defects at low cost with minimal operator training.  Microwave hose NDE can be done using portable handheld devices roughly the size and weight of a flashlight.  Microwave inspection is based on the change in dielectric properties associated with hose defects like delamination, disbonding, and wall thinning.  These changes are detected by sensing reflected microwave energy, and complex signal processing routines are not required to observe them with high reliability.  Microwave NDE is done in real time - results are immediate and can be as simple as the blink of an indicator light - so position recording or complex scanning equipment is not necessary.  Development of microwave NDE for hose inspection will result in a battery powered NDE tool - more like a battery operated drill than a computer driven system - and as such has a very high potential for commercial success in both Navy and industrial applications. TRI/Austin has committed to funding - at no cost to the project - a business study by an MBA candidate team to map the path for moving microwave hose NDE to the commercial market after development.",

        "abstract": "The opportunity exists to develop a reliable, precision-guided descent and recovery system for high altitude payloads.  Government agencies launching space, sub-orbital, and near-space payloads desire the ability to safely recover these payloads without the risk of landing in restricted, inaccessible or populated areas.  Payloads of particular interest are those involved with aborted launches, improper orbit insertions, and spacecraft operational failures.  To assure safe payload returns - a controllable sub-sonic recovery device must be incorporated with a functional hypersonic deceleration device.  Autonomous parafoil systems using GPS guidance are the obvious choice for sub-sonic precision recovery.  Low-surface-loading, inflatable, hypersonic drag devices can achieve sufficiently low ballistic coefficients to allow parafoil deployment.  Once a payload has been decelerated to sub-sonic velocity and a parafoil can be deployed - the parafoil guidance can steer the payload to one of many pre-programmed landing sites.  Phase I of the proposed SBIR effort will concentrate on the feasibility of decelerating high altitude, space payloads to velocities that will permit deployment of an autonomous, GPS guided parafoil recovery device.

        "abstract": "Modern electronic devices dissipate significant amounts of thermal energy at comparatively high heat fluxes up to 200 W/cm2 . Thermal management of power electronics will be very important not only for existing and future DOD applications but also for the success of the electric car, more efficient electric power distribution systems, etc. Heat pipes have been successfully used for cooling of various electric components. Thermacore manufactures miniature heat pipes that can withstand heat fluxes up to 50 W/cm2 on the evaporator wall. However, miniature heat pipes with higher heat fluxes, capable of operating at any orientation in gravity field are yet to be developed.  The proposed program will develop innovative high heat flux miniature heat pipes tolerant to accelerations and vibrations, using combined capillary structures with porous metal elements. Prototype miniature heat pipes will be fabricated. Additional benefit of this Phase I program will be the initiation of mathematical modeling of major heat and mass transfer mechanisms in high heat flux two-phase systems, which will be continued and used in the Phase 11 work for optimization of performance characteristics of high heat flux heat pipes.",

The Loop Heat Pipe condenser tubing will be integrated into the composite skin of the engine inlet cowl.  This essentially turns the composite skin into a radiator panel.  The proposed program will address and quantify the use of these panels as heat rejection radiators.  Such radiator panels can be applied to most of the upper surface of the aircraft and are equally suited for convective or radiative heat rejection.  The concept supports a self-contained by-pass system which will autonomously switch in additional panels as the system temperature rises in response to diminished convective heat loss with altitude so the system will passively maintain operating temperature limits.  The avionics compartment of the Global Hawk is presently cooled by pumping fuel through the compartment.  The proposed system will keep the fuel out of the avionics compartment and also increase operating margins for end-of-mission conditions.",

        "abstract": "Helicopters are very vulnerable to small arms fire during low-flying operations.  One major concern is the loss of the primary oil supply in the transmission due to battle damage.  The absence of lubricant and subsequent overheating can cause the gears to fail prematurely.  For high-speed highly-loaded gears, the heat generated by friction between the transmission gears cannot be effectively dissipated through the current gear material.  New gear and heat transfer designs are required to allow high speed gears to operate for thirty minutes after loss of the primary oil supply with no supplemental emergency oil supply.  Thermal Products, Inc. proposes to fabricate an aluminum composite heat sink, containing oriented, high-conductivity graphite fibers.  The heat sink will be attached within the side of the gear. The high-conductivity graphite fibers will be oriented within an aluminum alloy matrix to transfer heat away from the surface contact regions of the gear toward the cooling fins of the heat sink.  The aluminum composite will also exhibit a low thermal expansion to minimize thermal mismatch stresses between the gear and heat sink material.  In Phase I, thermal and mechanical properties of the aluminum composite will be determined.  A prototype heat sink will be fabricated.  BENEFITS:  The material will find use as a thermal plane or heat spreading material in high-power electronic applications because of the high conductivity and tailorable thermal expansion.  The material may find application in helicopter oil reservoirs.",

        "abstract": "We propose an approach for the investigation of algorithms to be used to generate time-varying texture for synthetic background scenes in the mid and long-wave IR bands and the millimeter wave bands.  These algorithms will be based on deterministic physics, with average values of background signatures based on physical modeling of average terrain properties.  The sub-pixel signatures (i.e., the texture) will be based on physical modeling of the same processes controlling the large scale signature.  The terrain properties used to drive the model will be varied through their statistical distributions, generating an appropriate signature variation to be applied to the large scale average signature.  The algorithms to be investigated for the terrain and emission modeling will be taken from methods either in current use or in development and described in the technical literature.  The development of entirely new algorithms for terrain and emission modeling is not proposed.  Given physics-based predictions of the large scale average signatures and the small scale variation of the signatures about these averages, texturing algorithms will be investigated to be used to apply the spatially varying total signature to the synthetic scene.  BENEFITS:  The algorithms developed in this project could be applied to electro-optical system development, automatic target recognition algorithm development, and the training of military personnel.",

The secondary objective of this Phase I project is to demonstrate the feasibility of constructing a small (sugar cube size), lkV device that can be driven and controlled with a 5 volt supply. These small devices should be able to be configured in series and/or parallel arrays to provide a wide range of high-voltage power supply options. Because of their anticipated small size and rugged design, the MPCP devices can be used in long term storage weapons such as mines and missile launch tubes. As the primary actuator is activated by application of an external magnetic field, firing of the mechanism can be accomplished without mechanical contact.

Emphasis will be placed on simplicity toward the goal of a low-cost product.  To reduce cost, two approaches will be considered.  One is to simplify the RF circuitry and packaging as much as possible while maintaining performance requirements.  Two is to apply batch processing techniques to the packaging as well as the circuitry.  Experimental test data from existing Ka-band MMICs, as well as computer simulations, will be utilized in performing the trade-off analysis.

Current test programs have no means to evaluate the effects of these changing factors on equipment performance tolerances.  The poblem is exacerbated by the lack of archived performance data and diminishing sources of parts to repair legacy systems.The goal of this task is to investigate and apply statistical process control (SPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in combination to detect trends in failure data, capture and interpret the trends and then provide information for decision support.  The proposed solution envisions a three layer model.  The first layer being a management data base which accepts test failure data and organizes it for viewing, evaluation and archiving.  The SPC layer interprets the failure data and creates performance characteristic patterns, which are then archived in the management layer.  The AI layer utilizes an expert system (ES) shell to integrate the statistical interpretation of thest data from a unit under test with prior interpretations of historical data, thereby generating appropriate decision support information.  By continually updating historical data, the system performance will improve with time.",

        "abstract": "This proposal focuses on the development of fiber-optic link simulation software with a graphical user interface (GUI) to perform link analysis as described in ANSI/TIA/EIA-626-1995. In particular, the simulations will incorporate detailed physics based models for the fiber-optic components to simulate the loss, distortion, jitter, and noise characteristics of the links. The final simulation will be able to display time-domain signals at user selected points in the link, the eye pattern, optical source power versus drive current, and the bit error ratio for the link. The uniqueness of Toyon's Research Corporation's approach is that we will rely on or experience developing analog photonic simulations and use our existing analog link analysis tool, PHLASH\u00c2\u00bf, as a starting point in this development. The resulting software will be referred to as PHLASH-Digital Version\u00c2\u00bf (PHLASH-DV\u00c2\u00bf) and will be a PC-Windows simulation written using C++, and utilizing an object-oriented style of programming. In addition, Toyon will modify and add to the existing PHLASH\u00c2\u00bf models to add a digital link analysis capability.

In many cases, engineers have turned to composites as alternatives to monolithic materials.  Processing methods are needed to produce nanoscale composites which derive unique properties from their well-ordered structure.  Research into polymer/ceramic nanocomposites can be both practical and help explain the relationship of the microstructure to the material properties.  This project will develop a novel technique to separate a block of copolymer into separate microphases with well-ordered nanostructured domains.  Barium titanate will be hydrothermally synthesized to form a barium titanate/polymer composite with improved dielectric properties.  In Phase I, a series of block copolymers of polyimide and polydimethylsiloxane will be synthesized with different volume fractions of the two components.  The morphology of the microphase separation will be studied as a function of the polymer ratios.  A titanium alkoxide which is miscible in only one of the polymer phrases will be introduced into the block copolymer and converted to barium titanate by hydrothermal synthesis.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   Barium titanate/polymer composites would find use as high energy density capacitor materials for efficient energy storage devices.

        "abstract": "The performance and endurance of military electronic equipment depends on the implementation of advanced scientific and engineering technology.  Lightweight and inexpensive power supplies with long life would be especially valuable.  A useable life greater than four years, independence from solar flux,continuous current, and a materials cost less than $100/Watt-year are advantages offered by photon batteries which can be developed on the foundation of advanced solar voltaic and radiation detection technologies.  The purpose of this proposal is to present a project work plan for construction and testing of a photon battery using tritium as the sealed radioactive source.  Low current electronic devices are increasingly important in military and civilian life, yet electrochemical battery technology has not progressed in a manner commensurate with the electronics because of the inherent electrochemical limitation that chemical reagents are quickly exhausted under load.  Small, modular, power supplies will be developed for military electronics that provide continuous current for over four years on the basis of this research.  BENEFITS:Successful completion of this applied research project could result in reduced military use of chemical batteries, greatly enhanced performance of electronic devices, all at lower cost and lower weight.",

The system will allow simulation and evaluation of locomotion (walking, running and climbing) under a variety of loading conditions, over a variety of terrain and when constrained by clothing or equipment.  Such a system will be an improvement over commercial human modeling systems currently available which generate movements either from direct motion capture, key frame interpolation, or inverse kinematics.  The advantages of physics-based forward dynamics simulations are improved realism of human movement and increased generalizabilty to novel task conditions.  Phase I efforts will concentrate on developing a thorough and detailed technical assessment and working software prototype.  In Phase II, we will complete the software development efforts needed to realize an efficient, effective and usable human movement dynamics tool.  The software framework for this work will be the Transom Jackr human modeling system, now commercially developed and supported by Transom Technologies, Inc.  BENEFITS:A validatable, physics-based simulation framework allows for virtual prototyping of equipment configurations and loading arrangements, assessment of task feasibility, and more realistic representations of human movement in virtual environments.

This Phase I will  investigate the feasibility of uniting these elements into a new protective garment that is lightweight, provides advanced ballistics protection, has anti-spalling capability, and can provide a significant amount of impact and thermal protection.  This latter feature would be provided by the HACS material, which provides approximately twice the impact absorption for half the weight of other materials by laterally deflecting as much as 50% of mechanical impact energy.  In addition, HACS can be combined with microencapsulated phase change materials in fabrics and foams to provide an enormous enhancement in thermal cooling.  An optimized combination of these materials is expected to provide superior protection together with both transient and reversible cooling comfort to the wearer.",

        "abstract": "The classical methods for rejecting false targets in airborne infrared missile warning sytems, include spatial, spectral, temporal and angle tracking techniques, have been explored on numerous development programs are currently inherent in operational IR missile warning systems such as the AN/AAR-44.  However, flight tests have shown that there are still a number of ground sources that will create false alarms in the sytem.  Furthermore, the use of amplitude growth in target signal has not proven to be reliable method of determining if the detected source is an approaching missle.  The proposed effort will evaluate the use of a class of unique spatio tempora algorithms called Optical Flow to distinguish real threats from false alarms.  It takes advantage of the difference in characteristics between a source that is moving in the MWS field of view as the aircraft flies toward it and a missile that is approaching the aircraft at a much faster rate than the ground source.  The OFA algorithm proposed will also take advantage of the chagnes in range and range rate of the missile and not rely on the change in amplitude as the potential threat approaches.  The proposed program will evaluate the OFA on a UNIX workstation using the data recorded during the flight test of the SNJW IR MWS testbed.  This testbed employs a Galileo 256x 256 insb digital sensor and provides a credible model for future IR MWS sensors using 2DFPAs.  Should the OFA technique prove effective against current data, it is proposed in Phase II to conduct field and flight trials using the SNJW testbed.  This will result in a live fire test plan to be implemented in Phase III.  Since this sensor may be integrated into the LIFE laser IRCM program, the successful implementation of the OFA will also benefit that program.  The purpose of Phase III will be to develop a preproduction model of an IR MWS employing the OFA, that has the resolution and sensitivity needed to detect modern threats at ranges sufficient for engagement by a direct energy countermeasures system such as that being developed on the LIFE program.",

        "abstract": "The successful development and deployment of lightweight, high temperature. metal matrix and intermetallic matrix composites are critical to reaching the goals of the Joint Turbine Advanced Gas Generator (JTAGG) advanced development program. Current methods for processing these advanced materials into complex shape components and structures are expensive, requiring multiple processing steps and tooling specific to the desired shape. Directed Light Fabrication (DLF) is a solid freeform fabrication process that directly fabricates metal components from a computer generated solid model.  Phase I will demonstrate the DLF process for producing titanium alloy continuous SiC fiber monotapes and titanium matrix composites (TMC) with improved control over matrix composition and microstructure. The Phase I effort is directed towards defining the optimum materials processing parameters necessary for direct fabrication of a TMC ring structure with properties comparable to conventionally processed materials with emphasis on control of matrix microstructure and matrix fiber interaction. The follow-on Phase II program will focus on fabricating full scale TMC ring structures for testing and evaluaflon on gas generator cores.  BENEFITS:  Technology will meet the need to rapidly develop and process high temperature, high specific strength metal matrix and intermetallic matrix composites into complex shape components and structures. Applications include: hollow fan blades, diskless rotors, spacers, shafts, structural rods, links and vanes in aircraft engines, turbopump blades and rocket nozzles used in advanced space propulsion and power systems as well as biomedical implants.",

        "abstract": "Triton Systems proposes a unique flame resistant structural foam that can be rendered electrically conductive for Radar Cross Section and Electro Magnetic (EM) Shielding control.  This foam, called Triton conductive Flame resistant Foam (TCF-Foam), is fabricated from a PolyArylene Ether Phosphine Oxide (PEPO) with a Tg of 225C and a target cost of less than $19 per pound.  The method of producing the foam utilizes a technology that was developed for the US Air Force that reduced the melt viscosity of the PEPO materials.  The PEPO's are synthesized as low molecular weight macrocycles and then foamed and cured to form the high molecular weight polymer in a single step at 180C.  The addition of an electrically conductive polymer at 3 weight % produce conductivities of up to 200 (ohm-cm)-1.  This conductive polymer technology has been developed by Triton Systems for NASA.  The polymeric based electrical conductivity has been demonstrated with electrically conductive space durable films for static discharge control and epoxy/graphite composites for EM shielding.  Cone Calorimetry of the PEPO materials exceeded the MIL-STD-2031 when measured at 75 kW/m2.  PEPO foam produced by Triton systems has a closed cell structure which is required for compatibility with VARTM processing.",

This unique and innovative technology will embed a highly elastic barrier glass structure within the polymer sheet stock during extrusion.  This single-layered, recyclable food tray will replace the current unrecyclable co-extruded 3-layered tray.

This Phase I program will develop the enabling technology which could impact the food packaging industry as well as other applications requiring high gas-barrier and moisture-barrier properties.

Phenolic resins are known to have excellent fire/smoke/toxicity characteristics and yet available at a modest price.  However, phonolic novolaks are known to evolve water during crosslinking, have poor mechanical properties and fairly high viscosity.  We propose to develop furan modifies phenolic novolaks with alkyfuran derivative as a coreactive diluent.  Furans are known to have excellent fir resistance with low smoke evolution and are inexpensive.  Further, furan or furan derivatives can polymerize via the unsaturation at modest temperature in the presence of a strong acid without any volitlie evolution.  The flame resistance characteristics shall be further improved by addiction of a reactive cyclophosphazene which is known to be as effective flame retardant. The coreacted cyclophosphazene will not be leached out easily.  The mechanical properties of the phenolic novolaks will be improved by addition of silanol functionalized siloxane intermediates which have been shown to improve flammability characteristics too.",

The surface of the carbon fiber will be preoxidized to improve bonding to the polymer.

This new film adhesive is needed for on-aircraft repair of the Air Force's aircraft fleet.  State-of-the-art 180 degreeF service adhesives for repair bonding of aluminum alloy surfaces are typically one-part nitrile epoxy cured with dicyanodiamide and aromatic amines.  However, none of the currently available catalysts allows long term storage at room temperature or elevated storage temperatures of 90 degrees F or 120 degrees F, and also allows curing at 180 degrees F using vacuum in less than 4 hours.  Active research has been conducted in this area, and quasimechanical means for segregating the epoxy from the curing agent curative by such techniques as microenscapsulation or zeolite molecular sieves have been proposed.  However, these quasimechanical methods do not prevent premature gelling due to the closeness of the required long term storage temperatures of 90 degrees or 120 degrees to the allowable processing temperature of 180 degrees F.  Triton proposes to use photoactivable but thermally curable compositions.  Recent developments in radiation chemistry have led to photochemically latent catalysts which required UV for activation and heat for subsequent curing.  Such compositions have been demonstrated on steel substrates.  In this proposal, aluminum substrates and further optimization shall be done.",

The proposed optimization of various layers enables us to take advantage of high thermal conductivity of diamond to increase the maximum current obtained from each emission site thereby increasing the total current density. The proposed diamond cold cathodes developed using an integrated deposition-testing system will potentially offer higher stability, larger emission site density, and much higher lifetime than existing cold cathodes. Diamond's higher thermal conductivity, higher thermal diffusivity and lower sputter yield discourages thermal evaporation of emission sites, and thus reduces the possibility of catastrophic failure. UHV has constructed an innovative system whereby the cathodes can be deposited and tested without exposing them to air, and we propose to use this system to understand and optimize the emission site behavior.

The removal of metal contaminants has been an issue with respect to the availability of the metal, following recovery, for recycling.  This project will demonstrate the feasibility of using a novel reactor for separating and removing heavy metal contaminants from groundwater.  A high surface area electrolytic cell utilizing novel electrode materials will be designed, fabricated, and tested to collect metal contaminants from an aqueous stream, allowing for the easy recovery and recycling of the contaminants.  In Phase I, the feasibility of a novel electrochemical reactor for separating and removing heavy metal contaminants from groundwater will be demonstrated.  A prototype reactor will be designed, fabricated, and tested in order to conduct parametric studies and demonstrate scaleup potential.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   The primary application of the proposed technology is the cleanup of metal-contaminated groundwater and soils.  Considering the number of sites in need of remediation and the levels of contamination involved, the overall cost is staggering.  Commercial applications for a low-cost system are numerous and widespread._",

Lightweight materials with increased TPS operational temperature to over 3000 degreeF and improved surface durability and erosion resistance will create numerous opportunities for these applications.  The shortcomings of current insulating materials (e.g. AETB, FRCI, SIRCA) include lack of structural stability at temperatures below=2800degrees F, high density (=12-20 lb/ft3/), and high cost (+$2.50-3.00/in3).  The innovative TPS proposed in this project will provide an unequaled combination of structural and thermal properties, including temperature capability to >4500 degree F with outstanding erosion resistance.  This TPS will combine Ultramet's lightweight, low-cost, low thermal conductivity (low-k) reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) foam with aerogel insulation to reduce high temperature thermal conductivity and a frontside facesheet coating of refractory Ultra2000 TM, Ultramet's patented hafnium carbide/silicon carbide (HfC/SiC) coating system.

Solar cell technologies based on CuInSe2 materials have achieved the highest sunlight-to-electricity conversion efficiencies of any polycrystalline thin-film photovoltaics technology.  However, CuInSe2-based photovoltaic products have yet to be introduced into the commercial marketplace in large part due to the lack of simple, robust processes capable of depositing high-quality CuInSe2 films at low costs on large-areas with the high-volume reproducibility needed to commercial production.  This project will explore a simple, self-limiting, non-vacuum, low-cost technique for fabricating CuInSe2 films for solar cells.  The two basic steps are to form nanocrystalline precursor layers and to convert the precursor layers into large-grain polycrystalline CuInSe2 films.  Phase I will demonstrate that dense, uniform precursor layers can be deposited using simple, non-vacuum processes and that the precursor layers can be converted into device-quality CuInSe2 alloy films.  The key tasks are to demonstrate that planar, homogeneous precursor layers can be deposited at low temperatures using low-cost source materials and that precursor layers can be converted into dense, large-grain CuInSe2 alloy films suitable for fabricating state-of-the-art solar cells.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   The process for depositing CuInSe2 alloy films for large-area, low-cost solar cells should provide significant cost savings and should accelerate the commercialization of CuInSe2 photovoltaic technology for a wide range of applications._",

BENEFITS:  It is estimiated that the Military uses more than 3800 different types of batteries with an annual procurement cost exceeding $300 million.  This innovative approach for the production of thin film electrodes can be applied to many other battery systems, including nickel alkaline and rechargeable lithium batteries.  It can also be applied to fuel cells, e.g., in the deposition of thin films of YSZ in SOFCs.",

UTRON proposes to develop a new puled spray forming technique to fabricate such tubes.

Pulsed Spray forming will 1)provide fine control of the thickness of layers to optimize performance, and 2) reduce heating and remelting of inner polymer layers due to its pulsed nature.  This technology can be extended as a rapid prototyping technology by integration with a computer aided design (CAD) system.  This technique can produce the desired two-layer thermoplastic tube, and can be adapted to produce multiple layer tubes.  During PhaseI, we propose to:1.  Experimentally fabricate a two layer functionally-graded thermoplastic tube using the pulsed spray forming technique.2.  Perform a conceptual design of an engineering prototype capable of fabricating large scale liquid rocket ducts.

In subsequent discussion this leak identification system will be referred to as the Eclipse Detection System (EDS).  Proof of concept will be accomplished by designing and testing a prototype EDS that detects the flow of selected unheated or cooled gas through fuel tank leaks.  These prototype tests will show EDS's to be:  (1) comparable in size and ease of operation to a conventional camcorder, (2) less expensive than proposed or currently available methods, (3) more user friendly, and (4) will provide improved imagery with leak areas shown as black spots and/or plumes on a TV monitor.

        "abstract": "Military and civilian users need deployable wings with high glide ratios.  Applications include high offset airdrop, covert personnel insertion and sport flying.  Ram air wings (parafoils) have relatively low glide ratios, generally less than 4:1.  Paragliders have better glide performance at very low speeds, but are not suitable for deployment from free fall.  Parafoil performance is limited principally by (1) high parasitic drag from suspension lines, (2) high profile drag from leading edge inlets, and (3) high induced drag due to low aspect ratio.  All three of these drag sources can be reduced by the introduction of internal structure to the wing.  Technology now exists for high strength, light weight, packable/deployable structures that are compatible with this requirement.  High pressure, seamless airbeams have been developed for transportable shelters.  These are manufactured by a braiding process that allows curved shapes to be made conveniently.  This research has the objective of demonstrating the feasibility of using airbeam technology to dramatically improve the glide performance of ram air wings.  Airbeam spars will be added to an existing parafoil and tested for improved L/D.  BENEFITS: A high glide wing that is deployable form free fall and has a glide ratio of 8:1 or better is useful for a variety of military applications, principally associated with delivery of personnel or equipment.  There is also a known, demonstrated market for easily portable, foot launched gliders for sport flying.  The proposed wing has a unique combination of performance and convenience that will appeal to this market.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this multi phase SBIR effort is the design, development, test and demonstration of a simple, cost effective system for global tracking and recovery of stolen assets Such a system does not presently exist, but would be invaluable for both military and commercial applications. Commercially, global monitoring and tracking is necessary because in many cases vehicles are stolen and shipped, or driven, to foreign countries for sale. Military operations by their very nature are global and require deployment of equipment and aircraft to various regional contingencies located throughout the world. More specifically for this solicitation, it would provide the Air Force Security Police world wide tracking for recovery of valuable stolen assets such as vehicles, weapons, nuclear assets, etc. Not only does the proposed system provide global coverage it also allows the location of concealed assets, another capability not currently supported by existing or planned systems. In addition, because of ViaSat's unique combination of digital signal processing, modulation, coding, and interleaving, and operation at C band, antennas the size of quarter can be used for ommunication! ! ! Finally, the system uses existing geosynchronous satellites, and therefore is not dependent on the technical and financial success of the planned Low Earth Orbit (LEO) systems.",

In the event of a mishap or accident, rescue agencies would be able to quickly   determine the precise location of the incident as well as make initial   determinations as to the cause of the incident.

        "abstract": "Co-channel interference (CCI, i.e. interference from like-modulated signals), is rapidly emerging as one of the greatest impacts to new digital data communications systems, both military and commercial. Multiple users in the same frequency band and overlapping geographic locations often impact performance of communications equipment more than noise or more conventional interference. Multipath and dispersive channels firther exacerbate this impact. A new approach to mitigating Co-channel interference in a dispersive environment, applying Per Survivor Processing (PSP), offers the opportunity to achieve large performance improvements (e.g. improved acquisition, &/or interference rejection) over conventional design techniques when a large number of users, difficult dynamics and/or large channel uncertainties are present. Further, PSP excels when the channel characteristics, the number of interferers or reflections, & other key signal parameters are unknown. ViaSat proposes to develop CCI suppression concepts for multipath environments based on PSP techniques, both scalar and vecton Performance will be analyzed and implementation complexity sized and optimized. Comparisons will be made to conventional approaches. Strawman architectures will also be derived. If the Phase I program is successful ViaSat will clearly show that a PSP based CCI suppression scheme is practical and that it can take full advantage of existing commercial technology.  BENEFITS:  These PSP CCI suppression techniques offer the potential to greatly enhance the number of users and/or cell packing density through improved frequency reuse on commercial TDMA cellular systems. These same techniques can reduce in-band interference for many emerging military communications systems as well as enhance signal collection schemes.",

        "abstract": "This proposal describes an SBIR Phase I program to establish a producible low cost design that enables the implementation and use of Subminiature Telemetry instrumentation to support future Air Force test missions.  The Subminiature Telemetry concept, initially developed and tested under DOD Test and Technology and Demonstration funding, has long been viewed as an attractive alternative method for instrumentation of munitions and/or fleet aircraft.  Because the system and its key subsystem devises, the Integrated Telemetry Package (ITP) and Receiver Demodulator Unit ((RDU), have not migrated towards low cost, producible devices, the SMT concept has not provided the gains that could be realized with its use. This SBIR program takes advantage of the latest in commercial technology and low cost production to satisfy the requirements for SMT instrumentation.  The SBIR effort focuses on determining the best approach for multiple access and frequency use, and provides for the determination of an approach to a fesible producible SMT.ViaSat has developed and demonstrated a very similar system, the Miniaturized Data Acquisition Transceiver (MiniDAT).  This system encompasses the features of the SMT system, using a commercially oriented PC Card (PCMCIA Type II card) architecture. Using lessons learned from the development of the MiniDAT system, and ViaSat's knowledge of spread spectrum communications and PC Card technology and manufacturing, production design cost goals can be established and achieved for an SMT system.",

To meet the demanding performance requirements, a high frequency, multi-module, phase interleaved, approach will be employed.  The design will also incorporate several VPT-developed technologies.  These include a new integrated magnetic power circuit topology, a technique for reliably self-driving synchronous rectifiers, a new feedback control technique, and a multi-layer hybrid packaging technique.  VPT's integrated magnetic circuit minimizes the number of interconnects on the transformer secondary and was specifically developed for low voltage, high current applications.  The self-driven synchronous rectifier approach recovers energy stored in the device capacitance, yet unlike prior art, allows reliable parallel module operation down to very low output voltages.  The feedback control technique allows high bandwidth performance with complete isolation yet does not use an opto-coupler.  To achieve high density packaging, a multi-layer hybrid construction technique will be compared against surface mount technology.  The converter will be compatible with the requirements of several popular new high-voltage regulated satellite buses including Space Systems Loral, +100Vdc, Hughes, +50Vdc, and Lockheed-Martin, +70Vdc.",

Its ability to be implemented as a monolithic design will result in a package less than one centimeter in length, immunity to extreme environments such as EMI and ultra-high g-loading.  Low cost manufacturing is assured by the fact that implementation of the technique is accomplished using components already in mass use for such fields as CD players and Fiber Optic Communication.

Our preliminary analysis of these applications indicate that they stand to gain from the combination of the intensity modulation technique and the use of lightweight and efficient laser diode technology.

        "abstract": "This proposal describes a computational model of human observers, DYTA(dynamic Target analysis), for dynamic target detection, depth and velocity estimation DYTA will be developed based on human perception knowledge as well as physics of moving vehicles. The computational model consists of two levels of processes, early and cognitive visual processes. At the early visual processes level, DYTA has two independent units: Gabor multi-channel filtering to model human early vision processing, and computation of motion vectors of moving vehicels based on the physics of moving vehicles. At the cognitive level, DYTA has a fuzzy learning and inference model for reasoning about the behavior of dynamic targets, such as Location, distance and velocity.  The algorithma we will develop in phase I includes computing target location by combining texure and motion features; computing depth and velocity of moving targets using rigid body motion techniques; and performing fuzzy learning and inference.  A number of basic research issues will be addressed including moving vechicle detection, 3D structure recovery from image sequences,robust fuzzy learning and inflerence under uncertain and incomplete knowledge. DYTA is designed to predict human observer's response to the dynamic information in a scence,in particular, to moving vehicle location, distance and velocity.  BENEFITS:  This technology has potential applications in both military and commercial markets. Examples of such applications are military dynamic target detection and acquisition, military and commercial surveillance, a monitoring and warning system in military operational driving, commercial vehicle saftey study, driver's warning system and visual enhancement, highway traffic control. etc",

To realize and maintain an accurate model, errors in the model must be identified and corrected.  Until now, model calibration and error correction has been done manually and is extremely time consuming due primarily to the large search space.  The purpose of this project is to automate model calibration and error correction.  It will build on existing technology for model calibration, adding a knowledge-based layer embodying expertise in pattern recognition and data interpretation necessary to apply orbit fitting and data analysis methodologies effectively.   In Phase I, a prototype knowledge-based system for automating the use of model calibration codes will be developed.  This technology will be tested against a set of simulated problems from anactural research environment.  Using this study as a basis, a careful analysis of the requirements for automating model calibration and error diagnosis will be made, including the feasibility of implementing self-correcting online models.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   Benefits include enhanced control capabilities in the operations of linear accelerators, colliders, and synchrotron rings, as well as an analytic tool to assist in the future commissioning of new experiments.

        "abstract": "Tanks of different models have unique acoustic signatures. These signatures can be used for detection and for identification. One approach is to analyze the signature in the spectral domain, using the Fourier transform, and comparing new sound samples with known templates. Problems arise when signatures vary or are corrupted by noise.  The problem of signature recognition has much in common with speech recognition, an active field for several decades. We propose to apply traditional and novel speech-recognition techniques to the identification of acoustic signatures. Preliminary tests in this proposal, applied to Army-supplied signature data, show error rates of less than 1%.  In Phase I we will first develop                                                    rier features that have proven more robust, such as cepstral and linear-predictive-coding (LPC) coefficients. As back ends, we will investigate both hidden Markov models (HMMs) and neural algorithms. The algorithms will be modified to fit the problem domain in terms of frequency ranges and time scales. We will also apply more recent algorithms: the auditory image model (AIM) mimics the human auditory system; learning vector quantization (LVQ) is a novel neurally inspired, Bayesian optimal algorithm. The systems will be compared to the more traditional Fourier-based approach and evaluated for noise robustness.  In Phase II, we will develop a noise-robust, real-time system to be evaluated in the field.  BENEFITS:  Commercial applications for robust acoustic-signature recognition are numerous. In particular, the field of speech-recognition is on the verge of leaving the laboratories and entering the consumer market. Non-speech applications include fault detection in machinery and medical diagnostics.",

        "abstract": "The need exists to generate high-quality electromagnetic planewave enviroments over large assets or extended volumes for  testing avionics suites installed on full-size aircraft.   Previously, these conditions were realized only be using farfield ranges or large compact range configurations. We propose to investigate a unique solution to the problem.  Instead of trying to generate a planewave enviroment over the entire volume, we propose to design a system that creates an incident field that is planewave in nature only over local points on the SUT.  The test engineer indentifies the locations on an asset where the apertures of interest are located, and the planewave generator produces a field distribution where the incident field only over these locations have planewave amplitude, phase, and polarization relationships- -the field is free to assume any value in other areas of the test volume and on the asset where no specific value is demanded (say at a midpoint between two apertures).  By relaxing the requirement on the EM field in the entire test volume, we have greatly reduced the overall complexity and defined a tractable problem that has a potential engineering solution.  The system will be comprised of a set (three or four) of transmitting stations, each an array of broadband elements with individual excitation vector (amplitude and phase) control. The exact aperture locations on the asset and the direction and  polarization of the desired planewave are input to a genetic algorithm. The genetic algorithm researches within the near infinite family of excitation vectors for one that produces a radiated field that meets the prescribed criteria, i.e. produces a field distribution with                                     asset's apertures.  This excitation then drives the array elements to create the desired EM enviroment.",

        "abstract": "It would be highly desirable for military aircraft to utilize low-power radar when operating in all-weather conditions and low altitudes.  The problem with this class of radar is that it requires a large antenna to receive an acceptable return to conduct operations.  While such an antenna is acceptable for fixed wing aircraft, it is not for rotary and tilt-rotor aircraft because on-board size and weight constraints.  Electronically scanned antenna (ESA) technology could provide the solution to this requirement.  However, since airborne ESA suitable for expensive fixed-wing aircraft is generally expensive and heavy, it is therefore desirable to develop a lightweight, low-cost ESA that will allow incorporation of low-power coherent type radar systems on-board rotary and tilt-rotor aircraft.  As is well known, ESA's have been in use for about 30 years, but are still too expensive with a per-module cost of $300 - $500.  For rotary and tilt-rotor aircraft, the use of ESA will likely be predicted on the advent of array modules costing $100 or less per element.  In this proposal, WEO outlines an approach using its proprietary technology to develop a laboratory model to meet this low-cost requirements for ESA.",

The antenna is designed to operate in a very wide band (bandwidth in excess of 30% of the central frequency) and with incoherent MMW sources; this provides an ideal match to the desired operating conditions of a passive radar.",

This high performance field flattener technology is an enabler for wide-field hyperspectral sensors over the SWIR and other broad spectral regions.  Further there is potential for using these elements to reduce the spectral coordinate distortion that arises in grating-based dispersive systems.  Optimized configurations will be developed and used to model system performance and benefits in a hyperspectral system.

During Phase I we will demonstrate techniques for the growth and fabrication of large-area, high output blue LEDs, and show proof of concept by combining the large-area LED with a conjugated polymer to produce white light.

Dislocations in GaN are ubiquitous, a direct result of the lack of a lattice matched substrate for GaN thin films. Lateral Epitaxn'al Overgrowth is a process by which crystal growth is accomplished in directions parallel to the plane of the substrate. This innovative growth technique relieves strain between GaN films and the substrate and provides a means to terminate dislocation propagation in epitaxial films. Achieving device quality LEO material (very low dislocation density, very high electron mobility, high electronic quality insulating buffers) will be undertaken as the primary goal of the process development. During phase I we will initiate the development of LEO GaN wafers and evaluate the electrical and structural quality of the LEO material. At the end of phase II, WiTech will have prototype 2                    sapphire substrates.

The overall DNA-chip fabrication process will be simplified by using in situ photo-generated reagents and a programmable photo-modulated reactor, all in a desktop enclosure.  The use of conventional DNA synthesis chemistry and the elimination of the prevailing photomasks will allow for DNA-chip production with improved stepwise yields and at a much lower cost.  A concept apparatus containing an optical system, a microarray reactor, and a computer control system will be constructed.  The apparatus will be interfaced with a DNA synthesizer to accomplish synthesis of DNA oligonucleotides in the microarray reactor using the solution photochemistry developed in Phase I.  By the end of  Phase I, sample DNA-chips containing oligonucleotide arrays will be produced by the new apparatus.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   The new molecular array synthesizer should, for the first time, allow interested persons in the field to make high-density DNA-chips of their own design  at an affordable price.  Therefore, in addition to large pharmaceutical companies, the present major users of DNA-chips, the application of DNA-chips should penetrate every clinical and research laboratory for gene analysis and drug discovery.

Commercial multi-channel sampling scopes (up to 50 GHz) are available, but can measure repetitive signals only.  This project will develop a multi-channel recirculating loop signal regenerator, which serves as the front-end of a sampling scope.  The device regenerates the single-shot signal picked up by a non-intercepting electromagnetic detector, thus forming a pulse train.  Based on this technique, the overall objective is to develop a new instrument that will give as many channels as desired, for measuring multi-channel single-shot signals simultaneously.  Phase I will design and bench test a two channel optical fiber recirculating loop.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The project will provide a unique diagnostic instrument for measuring many very fast (>20 GHz) transient signals simultaneously.  The product can be used in high energy accelerator beam measurement, telecommunication, radar systems, air traffic control, border control, and drug interdiction._",

Small wind turbines could fill this gap.  Such a system has successfully been demonstrated, but problems remain before a wind-powered ice making system is commercially viable.  In this project, means of improving this system to increase ice production while retaining simplicity will be explored by reviewing past experience, extensive consultation with refrigeration industry experts, and computer simulations.  A system configuration will be selected, components tested, the controller designed and built, and the system as a whole tested at wind test sites.  In Phase I, system configurations, including multiple compressors or electronic speed control for load matching to increase ice production, will be examined using simulation tools and industry experience to balance cost, complexity, and efficiency. \n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   Ice-making plants are sold worldwide to fishing and other food industries located where electrical infrastructures exist.  But in many coastal regions, such as Alaska, Canada, Central America, and the Philippines, ice for packing fish is expensive or unavailable; these regions often have abundant wind and are good candidates for wind-powered ice making.  Ice also has economic value for medical and general food preservation._",

Stein, Principal Investigator\nMs. Cynthia A. Cote, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG02-98ER82715\nAmount:  $75,000\n\nCurrent sensors for measuring humidity on weather balloons are generally considered inadequate for supporting vital climate research efforts.  This project will investigate a new water vapor sensor suitable for use on balloon-borne radiosondes.  The proposed approach corrects several deficiencies found in current balloon-borne water vapor sensors, including inadequate accuracy, limited temperature operating range, and slow speed of response at low temperatures.  The approach couples a servo loop system to a standard humidity sensor.  By controlling the temperature of the sensor in relation to ambient humidity, the sensor can be forced to operate at a constant humidity.  This means that water vapor no longer needs to migrate in and out of the sensor, dramatically improving the sensor response time.  Phase I will bench test several candidate sensors in the servo configuration.  The bench tests involve four main tasks:  1) building several prototype assemblies with a heat sink, thermoelectric (Peltier) device, and sensor, 2) prototyping the control electronics, 3) chamber testing the sensor assemblies over a wide range of temperatures and humidities, and 4) analyzing and reporting the results.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The atmospheric physicist should have a greatly improved sensor for water vapor measurement.   In addition, many industrial processes require monitoring of water vapor in the form of dew/frost point or relative humidity, resulting in a large number of potential commercial applications._",

The most energy dense rechargeable batteries currently available are lithium (Li-ion) batteries.  A limiting component of Li-ion batteries is the capacity, stability, and rate capability of the electrode materials, in particular the anode material.  This project will develop a novel, high capacity mixed metal oxide Li-ion anode material and demonstrate the material with a high capacity LiCoxNil-xO2 cathode material in a Li-ion battery.  The scale-ability of the proposed prismatic design will be demonstrated and prototype cells with capacity up to 100Amp-hour will be fabricated.  The cells will incorporate advanced materials to minimize cell weight and volume while maximizing the electrochemical performance.  The cells will be tested to enable evaluation for electric vehicle  applications.  Phase I will develop a novel high energy density, mixed metal oxide anode material and a Li-ion battery which utilizes this material.  Mixed metal oxides will be synthesized and evaluated and anode materials will be developed using optimal oxides.  Prismatic 3Amp-hour Li-ion cells will be fabricated and tested to demonstrate the electrical performance possible with the materials developed in the prismatic design.  Ternary electrolytes with extended high and low temperature capability will also be incorporated into the design.\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  This technology will be developed for electric and hybrid vehicles.

This technology has been studied and tested since the mid 1980s and is now ready for implementation as the next innovation in digital GPS.  This approach also provides the ability to suppress jamming.This technology is also directly applicable to develoing a fully DSP-based frequency domain GPS receiver for high dynamcis and fast acquistion in jamming environments.  Prototype receivers have been developed and tested for high dynamic tracking, and there was a frequency domain receiver for use on missiles developed and manufactured by a foreign nation.  Frequency domain methods are also beginning t find there into new GPS receivers for fast, direct P(Y)-code acquisition in a jamming environment.  However, there is a not single receiver that combines all these properties into a single unit, and this is proposed here as a follow on to the preprocessor, which would be a module the full receiver.",

F/A-18 pre-roll-modification aircraft (F/A-18 PRM) is selected as the baseline aircraft for its low torsional wing stiffness and available baseline data.  The F/A-18 PRM, when integrated with VSS (F-18/VSS), requires only the outboard trailing-edge aileron for roll maneuver.  The present objective is to explore when and how to best apply the F-18/VSS concept and to access its payoff in terms of weight impact, maximum performance, and ease of structural integration.  The success of the F-18/VSS concept relies upon optimal design of the VSS stiffness scheduling with an ample range for VSS to apply post-reversal control for best roll maneuver while satisfying strength, flutter and gust response constraints.The feasibility study of the F-18/VSS concept will be performed using a proven engineering tool called ASTROS*.  ASTROS* is the enhanced version of the MDO software ASTROS with the integrated ZAERO (unified unsteady/steady aerodynamics covernig subsonic to hypersonic Mach numbers) and ASE (aeroservoelastic optimization/analysis) modules.  In addition, the impact of dynamic instability on roll performance will be investigated where a trade-off study between flutter suppression by passive and active means will be performed.",

The specifications of the transmitter will be designed in collaboration with the Chem-Bio Defense Command, the Army Medical Command, the Human Engineering Directorate, and the Soldier System at Natick.  The transmitted EMG signal will be analyzed to determine the rate of muscle fatigue by tracking the median frequency from the power density spectrum of the signal.  This is a well-established technique for static muscle contraction.  Because it is required to analyze dynamic muscle contraction, a new signal processing technique must be developed.  We will use Time-Frequency analysis techniques for this purpose.

We will examine the current and evolving middleware solutions available in industry for their applicability to military systems. Our recent experience includes designing interfaces to an Arsenal Ship C4I environment using legacy and new systems, where CORBA, DCOM and Java were candidates. This gives us a quick start advantage in designing a middleware solution to solve combat system specific problems arising from integrating legacy and new software.

The dry powder deposition of fine powders (1-10 micron) is currently a weak link in that there is not an adequate way to feed these powders accurately and reliably to existing approaches to direct-write can be investigated and accelerated.  Under this proposal, a powder gun will be developed that is capable of accurately and reliably feeding fine powders in a narrow beam with high density.  This prototype powder gun will be used to demonstrate a new approach to direct-write meso-scale electronics involving the writing of small feature sizes of adhesive followed by application of a fine powder by the powder gun.  This approach promises higher write speeds with smaller features, less powder waste and increased versatility than current direct-write technologies.

Fehrenbacher, Business Official\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG02-98ER82550\nAmount:  $74,952\n\nSiC(f)/SiC continuous fiber ceramic composites (CFCCs) have been identified as the material of choice in the fusion reactor environment.  However, three critical problems must be solved before SiC(f)/SiC materials are widely used for structural fusion components.  These problems are: (1) fiber and fiber debond coating instability in the radioactive environment, 2) the low densities (85%) that are typical of SiC(f)/SiC composites, and 3) the high fabrication costs of SiC(f)/SiC CFCCs.   This project will overcome problem #1 by using a new crystalline SiC fiber and by developing an innovative TiO2 fiber-matrix interface coating.  Problems #2 and #3 will be overcome through an innovative, low-cost SiC(f)/SiC processing technique that consists of electrophoretic infiltration of nano-SiC particles into the crystalline SiC fiber preform, followed by a reverse thermal gradient chemical vapor infiltration (RTG CVI) process to achieve 95% dense CFCC structures in one-tenth the time required for a conventional CVI process.   In Phase I, the process described above will be optimized and then used to fabricate a composite architecture consisting of a thin SiC layer sandwiched between two 95% dense SiC(f)/SiC CFCC structures.  The physical and mechanical properties of the CFCC material will be characterized and analyzed with particular attention on the critical properties for structural fusion reactor components.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   The fusion reactor components of interest include first wall structures, divertor structures, limiters, and other insulating or containment components.  Additionally, several military and commercial applications exist for the proposed TiO2 fiber-matrix interface coating.  These applications include; liquid and solid rocket thrusters, containment shells, turbocharger rotors and wheels, pump shafts, radiant tube burners and heat exchangers, bearing races, seals, and turbine components such as combustor liners and blisks._",

Fluidic valves are preferred over more conventional valves because of their extremely fast response time, on the order of several milliseconds. Fluidic valve bodies however, present significant fabrication challenges due to the complicated internal flow channels and cavities in the multistage amplifier designs. The proposed fabrication approach is based on stereolithography, a solid freeform fabrication method that Ceramic Composites, Inc has adapted to the direct fabrication of metal and ceramic components. The fabrication approach enables consideration of several innovative lightweighting options which will also be pursued in Phase I. The proposed work seeks to develop photocurable rheniun resins and demonstrate their use in stereolithography fabrication of hot gas valve bodies. In addition, lightweight rhenium composite materials will be fabricated and tested. Density reductions approaching 50% are expected with limited loss, and some enhancement, of key properties relative to solid rhenium.",

The informatioon will also be fed back to the existing ISF system for use in radio frequency (RF) testing of GPS units.  The GMVT will be based on existing computational techniques and commercially available software with extensions to support specific GMVT functionality.

However, fractured gas reservoirs are often by-passed because reserve figures cannot be assigned to the reservoir to determine the economics of production.   This project will collect, manipulate, and analyze multicomponent seismic data in order to develop, verify, and validate geological models that would predict the width and volume of fractures containing readily producible reserves in source/reservoir rocks such as the Devonian Shales.  The utility of related seismic techniques will be evaluated as reconnaissance tools for fractured reservoirs.  During Phase I, geology and tectonic history will be also reviewed to determine the types of fractures that should exist in the region.  Remote sensing imagery and photography will be used to map surface expressions of the various fracture systems.   Geophysical studies will examine the probability of detecting each type of fracture, specify the location and orientation of geophone sets to optimize data collection, and identify procedures required to interpret the data to detect the fractures and map them 3-dimensionally.  Geologic models of the fractures will be proposed relating to differing genetic origins.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  A number fractured shale reservoirs in the United States would benefit from utilizing this methodology as a reconnaissance technique.  The methodology is expected to be tested in Michigan, Texas, and Kansas in an attempt to commercialize the procedure._",

        "abstract": "Systems & Processes Engineering Corporation (SPEC) and Dr. John Taboada of Taboada Research Instruments propose to design and provide proof-of-concept for an Automated Field Fluorescence Microscope (AFFM) instrument to rapidly and specifically identify individual biological particles in complex samples taken from the air, water, or blood. The proposed instrument combines the advantages of high-precision compact disc (CD) technology, fluorescence staining of nucleic acids, immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. The proposed instrument will identify pathogenic bacteria or viruses by detecting the fluorescence from membrane permeable nucleic acid stains. The AFFM will use this fluorescence signal to focus on areas of interest. Using confocal microscopy, the AFFM creates a high resolution 3D image of the target location while simultaneously measuring the fluorescence from a second, spectrally discriminating dye-labeled antibody. This dye-labeled antibody, though naturally weaker in signal, will be highly specific to a biological pathogen. This process can take place in a matter of minutes and provide highly specific detection of targets.  In Phase II, SPEC plans to design, construct and test a fieldable instrument which can rapidly and specifically identify individual biological particles, and which can be combined with an air or water sampler for remote. stand-alone monitoring of BW agents.  BENEFITS:  The AFFM instrument provides a capability to detect and identify single biological particles using a inexpensive compact disc based confocal microscope and fluorescent probes. The instrument developed in Phase II of this SBIR program has the potential to become a widely used commercial product with utility for field measurements and research in both the military and civilian sectors. Improved rapid methods for identifying pathogenic bacteria and viruses would be useful for a variety of applications.",

        "abstract": "SPEC and Dr. James P. Chambers of the University of Texas at San Antonio propose to develop biological obscurants for battlefield applications based on the use of bacteriochlorophylls. In this Phase I program, SPEC and Dr. Chambers will conduct spectroscopic investigations of bacteria containing bacteriochlorophyll b with tetrapyrrole pigments to demonstrate the feasibility of using chlorophyll compounds as obscurants. Also in the Phase I, we will investigate the use of combinatorial techniques to alter the protein microenvironment near the tetrapyrrole ring and thus tune the absorption spectra to provide multi-spectral capabilities.  The rational for use of chlorophyll compounds as an obscurant is based on the broad range of spectral absorption possible using chlorophyll derivatives. Observed absorption peaks coincide well with specific areas of military interest including: (1) the visible range; (2) night vision ranges including 700 to 800 for older systems and 900 for 3rd generation image tube technology; and (3) the 1064 nm range for most smart bomb and missile laser guidance systems. Based on these absorption spectra, bacteriochlorophyll compounds are excellent candidate compounds to investigate as replacements for obscurants currently in use which have a number of shortcomings including: limited spectral ranges, cleanup requirements, and toxic effects.  BENEFITS:  Biological obscurants could provide multi-spectral capabilities, environmental-friendly biodegradation, and non-pathogenic constituents and by-products. Other advantages could come in the manufacturing process by providing low-cost, rapid production and simplified storage and transport. It is conceivable that production of large quantities of obscurant could take place in forward locations from only small quantities biologically active cells.",

This       filling                                                               s, thus improving the stage efficiency along with the aeromechanical and noise characteristics.  Active control will be implemented to optimize the performance of the micropumps for system consideration.  A cooperative agreement is arranged with Allison Engine Company to participate in this research program.  They will provide technical advice and geometry for engine hardware.  In Phase I of this research program, the concept will be demonstrated in a transonic compressor cascade to document the benefit of blade suction-surface bleed and trailing-edge blowing. In Phase II the technique will be demonstrated in the Compressor Aero Research Lab at Wright Laboratories.  In Phase III, Technology in Blacksburg, Inc. will team with an engine manufacturer to incorporate the technology in an actual engine.",

        "abstract": "Many spaceborne electronic systems sensors are used to collect data on the environment or to determine whether an action is required.  While computation is always performed with digital circuits, the sensor interface generally requires analog signal conditioning.  Size, weight, and power consumption could be minimized (and performance could be increased) by integrating both the analog and digital circuitry on the same die, but it is prohibitively expensive to make such mixed-signal devices rad-hard, especially in small to medium quantities.  Tanner Research is proposing to develop a manufacturing technology and system that can produce rad-hard analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits (ICs) that are affordable in any volume.  Furthermore, our process will be fast, delivering fabricated devices within three weeks from physical design signoff.  We have already developed and demonstrated all but two of the key components for this process. We are currently enhancing and refining one of these two remaining technologies, and we are herein proposing to develop and demonstrate the remaining technology in Phase I.",

        "abstract": "Sensor advances toward large format, high resolution focal planes with fast frame times are limited by read-out bandwidth and processor throughput.  Biological vision systems overcome this difficulty by only operating on information relating to the target. Tanner Research has developed a near-focal-plane architecture that mimics this behavior, the Wave Process. It acts as a motion filter, operating on focal plane output in real-time.  The Wave Process has already demonstrated an exceptional ability to detect low-contrast moving point targets, but in its present form, it is intended for use on stationary sensing platforms.  Tanner Research proposes to extend the Wave Process to detect moving point targets that are observed from a sensing platform that is moving, while still rejecting all focal plane data not near the target.  This approach to smart vision chips will significantly reduce the focal plane data rate and subsequent computational load on the down-stream processing.  The Wave Process uses revolutionary processing concepts that can be efficiently implemented in analog VLSI for a compact, high performance, low power signal processing component allowing near-focal-plane integration.  In Phase I we will design an extension to the Wave Process architecture and demonstrate it detecting moving point targets from a moving platform.  BENEFITS:  We anticipate the results of this Phase I effort will be to allow the Wave Process low-contrast detection capabilities be applied to moving sensor platforms. These advances will extend to commercial applications including night vision goggles and search & rescue binoculars.",

        "abstract": "Tanner Research proposes to develop a powerful and flexible reconfigurable computer and deliver a completely functional prototype by the end of Phase I. Because it will have a modular architecture, our reconfigurable computer will be significantly more cost-effective than traditional reconfigurable computers. Because of technological advances that have increased the logic density on a silicon chip, reconfigurable computers are better suited than custom ASICs for a wide range of applications. For example, unlike an ASIC, a reconfigurable computer can be easily and quickly modified from a remote location to upgrade its performance or even to perform a completely different function; hence, its non-recurring engineering (NRE) costs are reduced. Our modular architecture will further minimize NRE costs because it allows such costs to be amortized over an even larger domain of systems. In addition, upgrading a reconfigurable computer is easier and more reliable than upgrading an ASIC, because reconfigurable computer upgrades can be more easily developed, verified, and implemented. Because of our expertise developing reconfigurable computers, we will be able to deliver a complete prototype of the hardware in Phase I. In Phase II, we will refine the hardware design and develop a software development environment to further increase cost effectiveness.",

The complex tasking and coordination aspects of the ATO can then be viewed in a virtual world environment, allowing the operator to visualize not only the data structures themselves, but to comprehend the information in a more instinctive and natural way.  The main goal of the proposed Phase I effort will be to demonstrate the ability of such a system to improve the ease and speed of ATO production and review.  During the project, interface software will be developed to translate MIL-STD-5040 Air Tasking Order data components into VRML scene elements.

        "abstract": "Innovative Dynamics, Inc. (IDI) proposes to develop the POWERLAN network-a digital communications network that runs over existing DC power lines.  Many aircraft/spacecraft systems have bandwidth limitations on their communications buses such as ARINC 429, ARINC 629, and/or MIL-STD-1553.  While emerging fiber-optic buses such as MIL-STD-1773 could meet this need, retrofitting such networks to existing vehicles will be expensive because of infrastructure changes required to accommodate high speed serial communications.  Moreover, these high-speed networks are overkill for systems not directly involved in time-critical vehicles control.  Suitable examples include sub-system health monitors, damage detection sensor, and payload status monitors.  These systems could be more inexpensively controlled or monitored over a network running on the existing powerbus wiring.  The POWERLAN network would allow any number of sub-systems network access, limited only by signal strength and addressing limitations imposed by the selected software link protocol.  Phase I will develop a prototype network and demonstrate feasibility on simulated DC powerlines.  This effort will lead to a full scale implementation and installation of the system on a suitable testbed vehicle for field testing during Phase II.",

Empirical evidence from the new sensor, known as the GEM-3, includes large amplitude and phase changes over a bandwidth of 300 Hz to 23 kHz. Although the first GEM-3 sensor was fabricated during the fall of 1996, it has already gained widespread recognition for its performance, potential, and promise. We propose to advance the GEM-3 sensor during Phase I by studying the physics of frequency-dependent scattering, acquiring calibration data over a wide frequency band (300 Hz to 23 kHz), and improving the overall design. Specifically, we plan to (1) study the physics using mathematical modeling, (ii) conduct con trolled experiments using the GEM-3 over known UXO-like targets, and (iii) develop a preliminary design of an improved GEM-3 sensor for UXO detection and discrimination based on the results of tasks (i) and (ii).  BENEFITS:  The GEM-3 sensor, when completed, will be in demand worldwide to satisfy the current UXO detection and removal needs. The technology would be applicable to detecting other buried objects, natural or man-made, such as landmines, sink holes, underground storage tanks, utility pipes, power lines, hazardous landfills, and lost treasure.",

In 1995, the Justice Dept launched a 2.15 million dollar initiative to develop and field-test several concealed weapons detection technologies.  The methods being studied include low-frequency electromagnetic detection, passive milimeter wave imaging, magnetic radiation, low level x-rays, radar and ultrasound, and low frequency magnetic imaging. We propose a new innovative low-frequency electromagnetic induction method that measures the characteristic canonical resonance spectra of a suite of known weapons and matches the measured spectrum from a hidden weapon with those stored in computer memory.  We have accumulated evidence that the broadband resonance characteristics can detect and usiquely identify a weapon (eventually and hopefully by its maker and model name).  We will utilize an existing in-house broadband, prototype EM sensor (called GEM-3) that is capable of measuring time - or frequency-domain data.  Through our frequency-domain processing , we will address the relationship between the poles in the rational-polynomial approximation to the model frequencies.  Through our time-domain processing, we will address the analgous problem of estimating the numbe of resonant modes excited.  The unique feature that our prototype sensor allows is the simultaneous generation of frequency- and time-domain data.  In the course of this proposed program, we will systematically study the relative merits of processing time- and frequency-domain data and the method of fusing the two response characteristics.",
