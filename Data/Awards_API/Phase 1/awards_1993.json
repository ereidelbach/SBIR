        "abstract": "Hematopoiesis, the regulated production of mature blood cells, is a complex scheme of multilineage differentiation which occurs mainly in the bone marrow of adult mammals. Mature cells are continuously produced from progenitor (or precursor) cells. Consequently, assays which detect these progenitor cells are vital in many research and clinical settings. The current assay procedures suffer from a number of shortcomings. First, they are carried out under suboptimal conditions which do not represent the in vivo environment. As a result, the assays are slow and the results may not be physiologically relevant. Furthermore, many current assay techniques do not ensure clonality; thereby, they preclude the harvest and study of the progeny of a single cell. Finally, most assays allow accessory cell interactions, and this often obscures the true action of the activity being assayed. These drawbacks can be overcome by the use of microencapsulation and rapid perfusion. We will demonstrate that single progenitor cells can be grown out clonally in a microcapsule. If this ability is demonstrated, then in Phase II the detailed dynamics of outgrowth, including kinetics, lineage reconstitution, and expansion of immature hematopoietic cells, will be established. This assay will be made available on a contract basis for growth factor screening, drug efficacy testing, toxicology studies and as a radiation assay.",

The goal is the development of a falloposcope with high resolution imaging optics, irrigation channels and steering mechanisms. The outer diameter of the front end will be about 1mm, which is small enough to facilitate transcervical use. An inexpensive fiber will replace the currently used and costly coherent bundle as the image guide. The image can be viewed directly or be imaged onto a CCD camera. High image resolution will be maintained in the falloposcope without reduction of field of view or depth of field. Phase I in vitro experiments will establish the feasibility of the proposed approach by determining the image resolution directly. In Phase II, a prototype instrument will be built and clinically tested. The final falloposcope can be used by gynecologists in office check-ups without the lengthy delays necessary for resterilization of such an instruments after each use.",

AbTech has developed an innovative network approach, called polynomial networks, based on over a decade of research in neural networks and advanced statistics. Polynomial networks are simply networks of very powerful high-order polynomial equations. It discusses how networks can be applied to substantially increase the control and diagnostic capabilities of systems in a practical and very cost-effective manner.

The technical challendges vary depending on whether the integrated circuit device is destined to be attached to the next level package by wire bonding, TAB or a form of flip chip attachment. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: Acsist believes that it will be able to commercialize a proven interconnect method for contracting one to several unpackaged die without damage to the attachment pads which is suitable for use in a wide range of temperature environments for the realization of the KDG concept.",

A major use of Halon 1301 is as a fire suppression flooding agent. The use of fine water mists from two-fluid atomizing nozzles is proposed as a replacement for Halon 1301 fire suppression systems, especially for Class B fuel fires. The optimum droplet size and atomizer water flow rate will be determined in the Phase I research. Several candidate atomizers will be tested against a standard n-heptane fire in a test chamber. Spray droplet size and water application rates will be varied over a range determined by modeling of the evaporation rate of the droplets. Requirements for a fire suppression atomizer nozzle will be prepared, based on the test results. In Phase II, a prototype fire suppression system will be designed, built, and tested on typical Air Force Class B fires. A specification for fine water mist fire suppression systems to replace existing Halon 1301 systems will be based on these Phase II tests.",

        "abstract": "The objective of the program is to investigate the use of parametric x-ray radiation (PXR) as a tunable, quasimonochromatic x-ray source for mammography. PXR is generated by placing natural, synthetic crystals, or multilayer structures into the path of a relativistic electron beam. The virtual photons associated with the fields of the electrons are Bragg reflected by the periodic crystal lattice and real x-rays appear at the Bragg angle. The production process is, thus, analogous to x-ray diffraction by crystals, except that the x-ray beam incident at the Bragg angle is replaced by a relativistic electron beam. This laser-like source is quasi-monochromatic, directional, easily tunable, and polarizable. Such a source would permit the determination of the optimum photon energy which minimizes dosage and maximizes contrast between tumors and normal breast tissue. We will develop a Monte Carlo simulation of mammography, which will calculate image quality and dosage as a function of the photon energy and bandwidth of our PXR source. We will determine the needed photon flux for mammography that can be obtained from a PXR source. To make the source more practical, we will investigate methods for reducing the needed electron beam energy to below 20 MeV. Experimental confirmation of PXR generation at low to moderate electron beam energies will be attempted using an existing experimental setup.",

The user will have his position and time in a universal reference frame used by the rest of the military. A pointing system based on GPS does not have to be calibrated, and is made of rugged, solid state electronics with no moving parts or optics. It will work in all latitudes because it is not susceptible to magnetic field deviations. In Phase I, Adroit proposes to develop the system and component functional specifications.

The electro-optical portion of the system will incorporate an input lens with an electrically controllable iris, a GEN III image intensifier, a coupling lens and a 2/3-inch CCD. With careful design and component selection, a signal-to-noise ration of 9 or better can be achieved at low light level conditions while maintaining daylight operability. Digital techniques will be employed both to optimize image exposure and to reduce noise. Iris diameter, intensifier gain and shutter duration will be set through multi-zone metering and fuzzy logic control. Fixed pattern noise will be filtered by temporal averaging and edge-preserving spatial smoothing tehcniques. Multi-zone metering and all noise filtering algorithms will be implemented in hardware for video rate output. Performance of the final electro-optical design will be verified through a detailed math model, and that of exposure control and noise filtering will be verified through extensive computer simulation.",

Independent of the growth method, residual stresses in large area HTSC/dielectric multi-layer films, resulting from both thermal expansion and lattice mismatch, continue to be a problem. In Phase I, ATM, working with Dr. Stewart Kurtz of Pennsylvania State University, will calculate residual stress in the HTSC films using a three dimensional model based on the Voronoi tesselation method, which Dr. Kurtz has applied to the analysis of residual stress in multilayer capacitor structures with great success. Local stress distributions in the HTSC films will be predicted as a function of texture, grain size (to the limit of single crystal growth), layer thickness, directional thermla expansion coefficient, and material physical constants. Interlayer and intralayer fracture can then be predicted from analysis of local stress distributions. In Phase II the model will be refines as a computationsl tool and applied to the HTSC multichip module fabrication problem. As appropriate, a wider range material systems and more complex device geometrics (including vias and trenches) will be examined. HTSC/multilayer structures will be grown, residual stresses measured and corrected with the predictions of the model. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: Residual stress/delamination continues to be a major concern of many commercial thin film coating processes. Computational models which can predict conditions leading to delamination or handling problems will save large sums of money spent on emprical development studies.",

        "abstract": "Kinetic energy penetrators are currently relied upon as a way to defeat enemy armor. Historically these penetrators have been composed of unanium or tungsten based alloys due to their high densities. In addition to density, the deformation behavior of the alloy determines it's performance. A penetrator whose tip mushrooms or fractures on impact is less effective than a penetrator that retains it's shape or has a tip that self sharpens. Although the densities of uranium and tungsten are similar, uranium alloys have generally exhibited deformation on impact that has resulted in better penetrator performance. The drawback with uranium alloys, however, is toxicity and cost. In this Phase I SBIR program, tungsten alloys will be processed in a variety of novel ways to improve their performance as penetrators. ATM proposes to produce large (>10 mm diameter) [100] oriented crystals of pure tungsten and W-Ni-Fe alloy rods with elongated and preferred orientation of the grains. The effect of rhenium additions will also be examined. X-ray diffraction, high rate compression testing, and optical microscopy will be used to assess the results.",

Illuminators currently used to view radiographs have a fixed-area, spatially uniform light output. This allows extraneous light to degrade visual performance and limits the viewable film density range to the dynamic range of the eye at a given adaptation level. The proposed viewing system will provide spatially modulated illumination to reduce the range of light intensities transmitted through and around the x-ray image; thus, it will lessen optical glare, improve photoreceptor sensitivity and expand viewable film latitude without compromising contrast or resolution. Specifically, this approach to film viewing should reduce significant false-negative rate in detecting pulmonary nodules on chest films. To achieve these goals, the project will aim to develop 1) a large-area, flat-panel spatial light modulator, 2) a variable light source with sufficient intensity to enable photopic viewing of radiographs over a wide density range, and 3) a mechanism to provide automatic illumination control.

The system architecture permits sudden appearance and disappearance of data objects, understands that the communication infrastructure can be temporarily partitioned, and guarantees that rule firings cannot cause unstable, non-terminating sequences of updates. The architecture permits a spectrum of data consistency algorithms and database transaction models. The data object structure allows procedures within the object to be preceded by a pre-condition that can check permissions, legitimate input values and data integrity prior to execution. Post-conditions implement consistency checking, replication of objects and processes, and triggers that further activate other procedures or other objects. Triggers enable versioning of objects. The toolkit consists of routines to communicate updates and register rules and triggers between databases. The architecture supports the efficiency discovery of objects that merit attention. It permits dynamic changes in the rule set, yet provides an efficient indexing mechanism to avoid evaluating triggers needlessly.",

(Co-Located Pixel) Advanced CMOS readout circuitry is incorporated in the focal plane array to perform the signal processing of the three waveband signals in a simultaneous fashion. The design readily gives the capability for Image Fusion of the three colors. Multiple layers of HgCdTe material growth by OMVPE method is described. Detailed fabrication steps to achieve pixel co-location are shown. Advanced MUX design for triple band focal plane array is described. The proposed method is such that the cross talks between the three wavebands and the adjacent diodes are completely eliminated.

This may induce chemical, physical, and mechanical changes in the composite material, and ultimately lead to component failure. This proposal will develop a fiber optic based Fourier transform Raman (FT-Raman) spectrometer for the nondestructive evaluation of composite material deterioration due to environmental weathering. This proposal will focus on the effect of photo induced oxidation occurring at the surface as a function of temperature and moisture. A series of composites employing graphite, fiberglass and Kevlar as reinforcement fibers in epoxy and polyimide matrices will be subjected to accelerated environmental deterioration. The FT-Raman system will correlate environmentally induced changes in Raman spectral features to changes in mechanical properties. These measurements will be used to quantify the degree of environmental durability of the various composites. During Phase II, this information will be used to develop a methodology to assess and predict in-use component performance. Also, during this phase a field-portable prototype will be developed which includes an extended fiber optic probe with the potential of assessing a full-scale composite structure employed in an Army system.",

The ATC gun is based on the concept of a projectile traveling through the propellant and deriving acceleration from the expansion of gases on the aft end of projectile. Since the projectile must travel through the propellant, the projectile is generally sub-caliber so that the propellant can flow around it. One of the most important unanswered questions in Ram and Scramaccelerator technology relates to the in-bore aerodynamic stability of the projectiles. If the stability of these sub-caliber projectiles was understood several important design problems for ramaccelerator systems could be greatly simplified. In the proposed Phase I effort, the in-bore aerodynamic stability of Ramaccelerator projectiles will be examined. A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code will be used to assess the static stability of the projectile, the effect of several shape parameters on stability will be explored and a linearized analysis for the dynamic stability will be performed. The results of the Phase I effort will demonstrate the usefulness of CFD as a stability analysis tool and lay the groundwork for the study of the dynamic stability in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "This proposal describes a novel, high thrust density Detonation Wave Engine (DWE) applicable to the Mach range of 0 to 3. The geometry of this novel engine concept naturally provides for integration into a new Combined Cycle Engine with Ramjets. The concept is an intermittent combustion jet engine that harnesses travelling detonation waves to accomplish compression and chemical reaction. The goal is to obtain an engine which operates in the Mach 0 to 3 range, integrates well with Ramjets to form a high performance combined Cycle Engine, and has low weight penalty. The Detonation Wave Engine through the controlled use of the strong gasdynamic waves can be configured to provide both engine aspiration (i.e. static thrust) and relatively high charge compression. These result in several potential benefits from DWE's includng 1) high thrust density, 2) high specific impulse, 3) significant static thrust, 4) natural geometry for integration into a Combined Cycle Engine, and 5) low cost. This project will in Phase I develop the cycle analysis tools for analyzing this unsteady combustion device complete with finite rate chemistry, determine essential engine configuration, provide the necessary tool to design tools to determine a Proof of Concept demonstration, and define the Proof of Concept demonstration to show performance and feasibilty. Phase II will conduct the Proof of Concept demonstration.",

        "abstract": "An innovative actively cooled structure concept is proposed which integrates proven cooling techniques and state-of-the-art fabrication methods to extend the maximum combustor wall temperature, thereby reducing cooling requirements and aircraft weight while improving engine performance. Specifically, CONvective and TRANspiration cooling (CONTRAN) are uniquely combined, relying on hydrogen coolant to permeat a carbon-carbon structure providing oxidation and thermal protection. State-of-the art fabrication techniques will be used during Ph I to develop the desired carbon-carbon permeability specimen based on thermal and boundary layer analytical estimates and experimental testing refinements. Preliminary characteristics will be defined based on results from undensified and densified carbon-carbon permeability tests, thermal and structural analysis, and shock impingement and coolant compatibility reviews. In Ph II, final concept design verification models will be fabricated and tested in realistic flowing gas environment representative of the NASP engine combustor. Based on the concept verification tests, a prototype 20 by 20 inch test panel of a CONTRAN cooled NASP engine combustor wall will be designed and analyzed. Pending funding, Ph II could include the fabrication and testing of the 20 by 20 inch panel.",

This project is to develop several material options through sputtered thin film deposition; whereby the pseudo multi-layer films will modulate the signature of sea vessels from the ultraviolet to RF regions. The proposed program is to use the research we have performed in the development of physical vapor deposited thin films, to further develop innovative coatings that fulfill the Navy's needs for the year 2000 and beyond.

        "abstract": "The use of biodegradable polymers for vascular reconstruction has two major advantages: the elimination of chronic foreign body reaction and the regeneration of arterial tissues including a nonthrombogenic pseudointima layer. However, it is well-known that the healing of human vascular tissues is very slow thus the risk of using biodegradable vascular grafts in human beings is the premature degradation of biodegradable vascular grafts. In this proposal, we are suggesting a novel method to accelerate the regeneration of arterial tissue, particularly the formation of a thrombus-free pseudointima lining of the graft. Phase I objective is to determine the feasibility to chemically modify surface characteristics of synthetic biodegradable polymers to control their adhesion characteristics for endothelial cells. Controlling the surface character of these polymers could a) lead to a better understanding of the interactions between cells and foreign materials during wound healing and b) significantly improve the biological and chemical properties of biodegradable polymers for use as new materials for the reconstruction of injured, diseased or aged human tissues and organs. The most important impact of this research is to provide the required knowledge basis for rendering synthetic biodegradable polymers to have the surface property that could selectively attract desirable cells for their subsequent attachment, growth and cellular functions.",

The Phase Doppler technique offers the best potential for making these measurements non-intrusively and with sufficient accuracy to meet the size distribution and volume flux accuracy requirement. Large optical systems that utilize Cassegrain mirrors will be considered. These systems have the aperature size that will ensure accurate size measurements and acceptable SNR. To process the signals reliably and at a very high data rate, the further development of the advanced Real-Time Signal Analyzer (RSA) using Fourier analysis will be part of the program. This new method for signal processing will be fully automated to minimize the need for user intervention. It also has excellent accuracy even at low SNR so it will meet the present requirements of accuracy in large scale facility operations. Software will be developed to expedite the measurements. A prototype system will be used to evaluate the potential of using this method for routine testing.",

        "abstract": "This porposal is concerned with the development of a rugged, accurate and non-intrusive electro-optical device to reliably measure the unsteady airflow into a reciprocating internal combustion engine. The principle of operation of the proposed sensor is laser Doppler velocimetry, a technique that allows for velocity measurements without interfering with the flow. The proposed sensor presents the following advantages when compared to other methodologies: it is robust; it requires no calibration; its sensitivity to changes in environmental conditions is minimal; presents no fouling problems; it can be used to measure both the inlet and exhaust streams; it is highly accurate; and has a very high frequency response. The sensor can be used for both laboratory and inflight tests. New processing techniques, and recent advances in solid- state technology make the construction of this rugged sensor possible. It is expected to be competitve with existing airflow measurement technology, both in terms of performance and price. Since laser Doppler velocimetry is an interferometrtic tschnique, the presence of contaminants or other substances in the inlet stream will only affect the signal-to-noise ratio of the signals, but not the velocity measurements. Also, since the technique is optical in nature, no obstructions or foreign objects are present in the inlet stream path. These features make this unique sensor to be highly reliable and accurate, while not affecting the engine's performance.",

Task 1 will develop an ATR cycle computer code, and be executable on an IBM PC or compatible microcomputer. The cycle code will then be utilized to develop an ATR conceptual design. Rocket propellents will be evaluated and used in a mission analysis. The cycle code will be integrated into a two-dimensional trajectory simulation code. A parametric mission analysis will be conducted, varying ATR propulsion design parameters, and propulsion system size. Cycle parameters critical to achieving the mission goals will be identified. A design will be selected and mission performance variations determined for alternative propellants. An optimum design will then be selected and recommended. Task 2 encompasses the detailed design of the flightweight ATR propulsion system. A heavyweight test component will be designed and fabricated.",

The supercritical storage allows delivery of the air in any attitude and prevents oxygen enrichment either in storage or in use. Because the air storage is at cryogenic temperature (- 180 degrees C), there is cooling available for the user as the air is used. This combination of the breathing air supply and body cooling is unique in this development process. A breathing system is under development on a Phase II SBIR from NASA/Kennedy, so here we will develop the potential of the SuperCritical Air Mobility Pack (SCAMP) for use in an isolation suit. The air must be warmed from the cryogenic storage to a breathable temperature which provides considerable cooling for the user. The tanks are smaller and lighter for a given use time which will make longer life systems possible. Phase I will be devoted to the determination of the particular aspects of use of the SCAMP in a closed Haz-Mat suit and to the interface of cooling to the suit. Phase II would be directed to the prototype development of a breathing/cooling system and its integration into the isolation suit. Phase III would be the qualification testing of the units.",

        "abstract": "The Air Force and other DoD organizations are continuously developing new electronic components for their weapons and other systems. In this effort they are in need of tools to aid in the automated design, or synthesis, of these components. One component of particular importance is the computer processor. It is of enough importance that the Air Force has established a standard for this device (MIL-STD-1750A). The research proposed here applies a new processor synthesis technique, based on the methods of RISC computer design, to the synthesis of the Air Force's 1750A processor. This technique will automatically generate, from a single instruction set architecture specification of the 1750A, different implementations optimized for different applications, with the different implementations based on the instruction frequencies of the applications. Phase I of the proposed research will involve proof-of-concept tests of the synthesis technique and the development of a plan for constructing a robust tool implementing the technique. During Phase II the tool will be constructed, evaluated, and demonstrated. Furthermore, reference manuals and user guides will be developed and training provided to USAF personnel in its use.",

        "abstract": "Tank Automotive Command (TACOM) of the U.S. Army has embarked on a major program called VETRONICS (Vehicle Electronics). VETRONICS envisions the application of state-of- the-art electronics systems in the form of an architecture that will integrate all the vehicle electronics and electrical systems including those directly related to combat, communications/command/control/intelligence(C3 I) and survivability functions. This system will enable future vehicles to utilize all the available information that results from the application of electronics technology on tomorrow's battlefield. An integral part of the VETRONICS program is the Integrated Two-Man crew station (ITCS). Normally a combat vehicle (i.e., battle tank) carries four crew members commander, driver, gunner and loader. When the crew size is reduced to two, viz, to the commander and the gunner, many tasks will be forced to be autonomous or semiautonomous not to overload the two-man crew. ITCS will go a long way to prove the fieldability of a two-man crew in a combat vehicle. The proposed Phase I effort will consist of an indepth study of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques and their possible applications that would be necessary to develop the ITCS. Tradeoff studies of existing hardware and software will be conducted. The effort will also consist of identification of other features to enhance future combat vehicles using AI. The Phase II effort will consist of determining the two most critical AI functions for development of the ITCS and developing the needed hardware and software for those functions for integration into the ITCS.",

Utilizing a combination of general purpose fractal compression with customized fractal algorithms for recurrent geometrical patterns, this approach promises to provide significant improvement over other compression methods. Phase I research focuses on demonstrating algorithms for specific patterns found in the right lung. Phase II extends the class of algorithms for the entire chest x-ray and incorporates them into the system. A catalog of standardized, recurrent patterns will be developed. Fractal algorithms will provide a measure of variance of test images from standard patterns within the catalog. Efficacy of this variance for diagnosing pulmonary nodules will be explored. Development of an efficient compressing system for chest x-rays will significantly impact electronic medical records systems, transmission for consultative, diagnostic and research purposes. The computer programs for decompressing images will be designed to be independent of the number or type of customized algorithms used in compression and will be readily implemented on PC's and other computer platforms.",

SOME OF THE MOST PROMISING TEECHNIQUES INCORPORATE SOLID-STATE X-RAY DETECTORS, WHICH ARE ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE OF THEIR COMPACTNESS. HIGH-Z SEMICONDUCTOR X-RAY DETECTORS HAVE FURTHER ADVANTAGES DUE TO THEIR HIGH STOPPING POWER. ONE OF THE DRAWBACKS OF HIGH-Z SEMICONDUCTOR DETECTORS IS THE COST OF PRODUCING LARGE-AREA ARRAYS. THE USUAL APPROACH IS TO ASSEMBLE AN ARRAY OF ISOLATED, INDIVIDUALLY-FABRICATED DETECTOR ELEMENTS. A COMPETING TECHNOLOGY IS TO ENHANCE LARGE AREA ARRAYS OF AMORPHOUS SILICON (A-SI) PHOTODIODES BY COATING THEM WITH A FILM OF HIGH-Z SCINTILLATING MATERIAL (E.G., CSI) BY EVAPORATION. WHILE THIS TECHNIQUE IS MORE EFFECTIVE IN STOPPING X-RAYS THAN USING \"NAKED\" SILICON PHOTODIODES, THE POOR CONVERSION EFFICIENCY OF SCINTILLATORS LIMITS THE SIGNAL AMPLITUDE. RESEARCHERS ARE PRODUCING SUBLIMED FILMS OF A NEW, HIGH-Z SEMICONDUCTOR (THALLIUM BROMIDE), AND CHARACTERIZING THEIR UTILITY AS PIXILATED DETECTORS FOR X-RAY IMAGE DETECTION.

It is noninvasive medical imaging technique which provides an image of the distribution of a positron emitting radio pharmaceutical in the body. At the present time, the performance of this important instrument is limited by the properties of the available sensors. Future advances in PET system technology can only come about by performing research to improve the sensors. In the program proposed, a new PMT concept will be explored which uses a fundamentally new operating mechanism while taking advantage of some of the strengths of photomultiplier tubes. The concept combines silicon avalanche photodiode technology with PMT technology. The result should be a APD/PMT hybrid which inherently has the potential for achieving better energy resolution than standard PMT. More importantly, this serves as the foundation of the construction of multi-element APD/PMT position sensitive sensors can serve as the basis for the next generation of position sensitive PMTs.",

        "abstract": "In neurosurgery operating microscopes are indispensable. Stereotaxic frames are invaluable tools as well because of the great precision with which they permit a neurosurgeon to place a probe with an accuracy on the order of 1mm. The goal is to combine the functionality of the operating microscope with the accuracy of a stereotaxic frame by outfitting digital encoders on the stand which supports the microscope, so as to monitor its exact position continuously with a computer. The precise knowledge of the microscope's position will permit the display of anatomic information such as a tumors outline in the focal plane of the microscope via a miniature video display. Preliminary simulations demonstrate that this is realizable with commercially available encoders. Our specific aim will be to verify this with a prototype stand. This device will be tested by comparing its position as computed from the encoders with its actual position on precision milled blocks of known dimensions. It is believed that the commercial prospects are very attractive given that any institution equipped to perform neurosurgical procedures will be a potential customer.",

In this proposal we describe an effort to accomplish this task; we describe several recently-developed, advanced methodologies that appear to hold special promise. In particular, in addition to standard methods of image analysis, we intend to exploit i) recent advances in multi-resolution and fractal image processing, including methods based on the wavelet transform; ii) nonlinear image analysis methods based on morphological filtering that deal with particular pattern characteristics that distinguish targets and clutter; and iii) spatio-temporal image analysis methods, aimed at exploiting the differences in the temporal coherency of targets and some sources of clutter.",

        "abstract": "The nonlinearity and unceitainty inherent in the HAVE DASH II missile's dynamics have been a great challenge to the autopilot design that is required to have satisfactory performance for all flight conditions in probable engagements. Several advanced robust nonlinear approaches, namely, inversion-based control laws, analytical gain scheduling, and nonlinear servo-regulator are proposed to design a high performance autopilot. The unique features of these approaches include that (1) they incorporate the nonlinear dynamics due to severe kinematic and inertial coupling as well as aerodynamics into the design process; (2) they furnish robust scheme to acount for model uncertainties due to aerodynamics and bending motion, etc; and (3) they provide adaptive mechanism to handle parameter variations of the mass and inertia, etc. Each of these features works to enhance the performance of HAVE DASH II missiles. The deliverables include a comprehensive nonlinear design/analysis tool together with detailed documentation, and training courses.",

        "abstract": "The integrated automatic target recognition (ATR) design provides a promising approach to achieving high performance based on multisensor data fusion, processing methodology integration, and target/enviromental/contextual information incorporation. In this proposal, American GNC Corp. (AGNC) will take advantage of the tolerance of imprecision offered by fuzzy logic and apply it to IR image scene modeling and pattern matching. It will also investigate the integration of fuzzy logic and neural network to blend the approximate reasoning capability of the fuzzy logic and the adaptive learning feature of neural network in target recognition. Phase I will demonstrate the benefits of such a fuzzy system in the integrated ATR system for tactical applications such as cruise missile looking for relocatable targets. The main innovations of the proposed approach are: (1) Integration of methodologies in every level of automatic target recognition processing: (2) Organization of scene models and input image structures based on fuzzy membership functions and fuzzy restrictions to increase tolerance to imprecision: (3) Augmentation of robustness of scene models and matching process and reduction of sensitivity to image quality and preprocessing: (4) Scene model generation which takes into account individual characteristics, deviations in image acquisition, and noise effects present in the training images. In Phase II, the algorithms of scene modeling and image processing for expert system and integrated ATR system will be fully developed, tested, and documented. The validated algorithms will be reduced to integrated circuit scale chip sets.",

The delivery accuracy can be improved through reducing the effects of significant error sources in targeting, fire control, and weapon systems. The increase in survivability results from the covert action and earlier disengagement provided by internetted operations. In this project, a thorough investigation of internetted fire control and weapon delivery designs is proposed from the system integration point of view. In Phase I, a baseline fire control/weapon delivery system simulation tool will be developed. Major error sources and their contributions to the overall error budget will be identified. Algorithms designed to reduce these errors within internetted environment will be developed including multisensor integration, data association, IMU alignment, trajectory shaping guidance. Advantages associated with internetting operation such as passive, cooperative fire control and enhanced reliability and flexibility will also be investigated. In Phase II and Phase III, the resulting algorithm will be further refined and perfected to support operational capability.",

To increase the availability, combat survivability, maintainability, and life-cycle cost effectiveness of advanced rotorcraft, reconfigurable flight controls are needed. In this project, a rotorcraft-specific reconfigurable flight control system is developed. This system addresses unique characteristic of the rotorcrft system which is not surface-rich in comparison to its fixed-wing counterpart. The fuzzy logics are used to furnish inflight fault detection, onboard expert diagnosis evaluation, and real-time fault accommodation functions. A two layer arrangement of fuzzy logics are also used for mode blending to enhance pilot handling qualities. Simulations are used to verify and quantify the performance of the fuzzy reconfigurable flight control system. In Phase II, the design, both software and hardware, will be implemented and tested in a hardware-in-the-loop environment.",

Although several techniques are available to evaluate subsurface corrosion, no method has shown the ability to scan rapidly a wide area of the aircraft to alert maintenance personnel to the need for intensive inspection procedures. To meet this need, this proposal suggests the development of an infrared differential spectral reflectometer for detection of corrosion products beneath coated aircraft surfaces. The proposal is innovative in combining differential reflectance spectroscopy for in situ electrochemical evaluation of materials with infrared image detection to provide a noncontact, electrochemical, nondestructive evaluation method for aircraft inspection.

        "abstract": "The Air Force has identified a need for more advanced digital control methodologies to make feasible the application of active magnetic bearings to turbine engines. Achieving the goals for enhanced turbine rotor performance necessitates improved bearing control with associated compact size/weight, fault tolerance, and minimum power consumption. Conventional control methods are inadequate because of the wide and highly nonlinear operating regimes which can occur due to unbalance or shaft critical speeds. To address this need, American Research Corporation of Virginia proposes the development and training of an innovative hardware based multiple layer, feed-forward neural network capable of addressing nonlinear operational conditions. The program is innovative in combining neural networks and digital systems into a hybrid adaptive control package to provide robust control of magnetic bearings under nonlinear conditions. Technical objectives include selection of neural network configurtions, development of a training set, evaluation of hybrid controller response, and demonstration of the proof-of-concept system. The proposed effort will demonstrate the feasibility of a neural network-based controller to provide superior engine performance. Results anticipated include neural network definition, system implementation, stability margins, fault tolerance and compactness. The significance of the program is related to the improved control of advanced gas turbine and other rotating machinery systems made possible by neural network adaptive control.",

        "abstract": "Sickle cell anemia is an inherited disorder of erythrocytes characterized by chronic anemia, recurrent pain, susceptibility to infections, chronic and recurrent organ dysfunction, and diminished life-expectancy. Even among patients having documented homozygous sickle cell anemia (Hb SS), there exists an astonishing degree of variability in clinical severity. Some die from strokes as young children, others live well into their seventies. Some seek medical attention for pain weekly, others go years without pain. The absolute nature of current therapeutic measures for sickle cell disease (SCD), e. g. termination of pregnancy and bone marrow transplantation (BMT), emphasizes the importance of pretherapeutic predictions of mild and severe disease before the nature of the disease has been declared. In this regard, we propose to use polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods to detect sequence variations that are related to disease severity - alpha-globin genotypes, beta-cluster restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) haplotypes, binding sites for erythroid-specific trans-acting transcription elements, and beta-cluster locus control region (LCR) sequences. PCR-based methods for detecting these sequences will provide the basis for developing a diagnostic kit that will predict whether SCD will be mild or severe. PCR based methods will also guide decisions regarding termination of pregnancy and undertaking BMT.",

Estimates based on this simple model have been poor. In this study a rigorous mathematical model based on the sinusoidal reaction formulation will be solved by the method of moments of the Galerkin type. Using a snap-shot model of various chaff geometries, possibly from a fractal based generator, both the mono-static and bi-static scattering signatures will be statistically characterized. Furthermore, the effects of aspect angle on chaff signatures will be quantified, and the correlation between the chaff signatures obtained at different look angles will be established.",

        "abstract": "The use of fibrous composites has greatly increased in the Navy. These composites have introduced challenging problem in process manufacturing of these materials. Dielectric sensors as well as ultrasonic embedded wave guides have been successful in cure monitoring; however, they have two severe handicaps: 1. Placement is limited to trimmings since the inclusions weaken the material; 2. The region monitored by the sensors is very small compared to the size of typical parts, requiring an impractical number of sensors. Thin film sensors,capable of covering the entire part, would solve both these problems. The proposed research, drawing on the well-developed technologies of thin film deposition and acoustic devices, would advance and adopt the surface acoustic wave (SAW) device technique to develop thin film/foil distributed sensor surfaces. Thus the proven technique of ultrasonic cure monitoring can be made noninvasive and effective over the entire surface of tools used in production. Phase I efforts will etch surface wave (Rayleigh & L-cr) devices on the tools and construct piezoelectric sensor foils that can be attached to the surface tools or placed in the lining of vacuum bags. Testing will be done on small composite plates. Phase II efforts will advance to life-size samples.",

        "abstract": "A laser-driven Vacuum Ultraviolet (VUV) photoionization source is proposed as a general purpose, high efficiency device for creating ionized species of biological molecules of several hundred amu or less in the gaseous phase. The high energy of the monochromatic VUV photons produced allows single photon ionization without resonant absorption considerations, while maintaining low power densities avoids multiphoton (and hence excessive fragmentation) events. As a direct result, loss of the parent specie is greatly reduced for a wide array of compounds, placing a substantial portion of the ion current in the molecular ion of interest. This feature may be especially advantageous if attempting to monitor mixtures of compounds or incompletely separated effluents from chromatography systems. The ability to couple this ionization scheme to an Electrospray Time-of- Flight Mass Spectrometer as a complementary technique will allow simultaneous, real-time detection of a wider range of species than is currently possible, including low molecular weight peptides, nucleic acid constituents, metabolites and pharmaceutical agent. The device is simple in both design and operation, is inherently a pulsed system which interfaces straight forwardly to TOF-MS instruments, and yields very high mass resolving powers due to its spatially focussed output. It could be incorporated into existing TOF mass spectrometers or built as a dedicated instrument.",

In Phase II, final concept design verification models will be fabricated and tested in realistic flowing gas environment representative of the NASP engine combustor.

Unlike conventional instruments, the proposed innovation will be characterized by high-frequency response and high sensitivity across the range of helicopter flight speeds. The proposed device will provide accurate speed indication both at low and at high airspeeds. The innovation items from the following significant advances made by AS&M in recent years: (a) the discovery of a direct coupling between airspeed and frequency of flow oscillations at the leading-edge stagnation region, and (b) the invention of constant voltage anemometry. A probe of specified geometry with closely-spaced, micro-thin multielement sensors will be used in conjunction with constant voltage anemometers to determine the true airspeed as well as the flow angularity. The frequency of the electrical output signals from the instrument will be related to the true airspeed of the helicopter. The one-time calibration of the airspeed indicator will be dependent on the probe geometry but independent of the installation (e.g., H-60).",

        "abstract": "The objective of this Phase i work is to develop and demonstrate that a frangible munitions container, one capable of passing an Insensitive Munitions (IM) cook-off test, can be presuced with a low-cost modification to the container can. The critical problem associated with existing containers is the rapid development of combustion gases and high pressures which cause the container to literally explode creating fragments which, in turn, promulgate the fire and create ancillary explosions. The design goal is thus to provide a modification to the can that will allow venting of the combustion gases without the creation of fragment. The innovative solution provided herein relies upon the use of fracture mechanics theory and analysis to define the geometry of a crack starter machined into the surface of the can. It is informative to note that within the time period that the pressure in the container rises to critical levels (approximately 10 milliseconds), a properly configured crack starter can cause the generation of over 31 feet of crack surface. This significant level of crack formation allows for more than sufficient venting to prevent explosion and fragment formation. The key element of the innovative approach relies upon the use of state0or-the-art fracture mechanics technology and stress analyses to define the precise dimensions of the crack starter. Also, since the number of potential crack starter geometries is virtually unlimited, it is necessary in this research, to define the configuration most efficient and reliable. It is noted that this approach, once demonstrated, provides an extremely low-cost and reliable sloution to the problem of venting. Phase I work will develop and demonstrate the feasibility of the innovative appraoch providing the Army with a highly effective system with concomitant low risk.",

        "abstract": "The Phase I research proposed herein provides for using the tremendous energy and pressure generated by embedded detonating cord (EDC) to not only sever an acrylic canopy but, more importantly, create and propagate cracks that weaken and fracture the canopy. The approach is firmly based on the use of fracture mechanics principles combined with tailored experimental testing to confirm important hypothesis. Prior experience of Anamet and our consultant, Dr. George C. Sib, with the fragilization of Navy canopies and the redesign of the Navy F-18 canopy and mechanical breakers has provided a good understanding of how stretched acrylic canopies fracture. During the early part of the Phase I work, experimental testing to determine the critical strain energy density will be accomplished and used in conjunction with Dr. Sih's theoretical analysis to define potential EDC configurations and charge sizes. Subsequently, small size panels made from stretched acrylic material will be fabricated by Swedlow, Inc. and tested by ET, Inc. Correlations of test data with design predictions will allow for the creation of a design methodology which can be applied and demonstrated on full size canopies during the Phase II effort. At the end of Phase I research, the feasibility of using EDC as the basis for an improved fracturing system for thick canopies will have been demonstrated. Most notably, this new fracturing system will not obscure pilot vision and both noise and debris will be minimized by virtue of developing systems which use the minimum amount of EDC charge.",

Two major serotypes (Ogawa and Inaba) have been identified as defined by O antigens of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Accurate serotyping and rapid identification of CT producing strains of V. cholerae by using monoclonal antibody based immunoassays are critical in clinical service due to the threat of the disease. The principal objectives of this study is to produce a panel of high quality of monoclonal antibodies specific to individual O antigens and cholera toxin. This can be achieved by preparation of purified antigens from V. cholerae, immunization of mice with purified antigens, fusion of the splenocytes of immunized mice with myeloma cells to generate hybrids, screening of antibody producing clones from these hybrids and characterization of these monoclonal antibodies. It is expected that a panel of high quality of monoclonal antibodies will be developed in Phase I and can be used for further characterization in Phase II. These antibodies will be useful to both research and commercial markets for development of immunoassays for serotyping and identification of CT producing strains of V. cholerae.",

In the United States, with the introduction of measles vaccine in 1963, the incidence of disease diminished from 200,000 to 400,000 cases annually to a low 1,497 cases in 1983. Following 1983, however, the number of cases of measles has rebounded to more than 60,000 cases and 100 associated deaths from 1989 to 1991. In less developed countries, measles remains a leading cause of child mortality causing about 2 million deaths per year. Some of the persistence of measles, in underdeveloped countries in particular, can be attributed to the failure to vaccinate key populations. Interestingly, in the United States, while approximately half of the recent measles cases occur in unvaccinated preschool populations, the remaining 50% involved those which were previously vaccinated. The rather simple explanations for measles resurgence, such as absence of vaccine administration or vaccine failures may not account for all increased measled disease. Therefore, other possible explanations such as the occurrence of antigenic variants of measles virus that evade conventional vaccine immunity are proposed as a basis for recent measles disease (Rota et al, 1992). Indeed, the genetic variability reported in current wild-type measles does occur in genes encoding fusion (F) and hemagglutinin (H) surface proteins whose functions are critical to virus pathogenesis. To this date, however, studies that might associate such variant strains to resurgent measles disease have not been done primarily due to the paucity of variant measles virus specific antibody reagents. Therefore, it is the objective of this Phase I proposal, in a collaborative arrangement with CDC, to make polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies to current wild-type disease associated measles virus or virus derived antigens.",

Primary reasons include the susceptibility of HIV-infected persons, the lack of rapid and effective diagnostic tests, and recent outbreaks of drug-resistant strains. The objective of this award is to produce monoclonal antibodies for the development of diagnostic immunoassays for detection of M. tuberculosis in clinical specimens, for diagnosis of infection, and for identification of drug-resistant strains. Superoxide dismutase and P32 antigen are secreted from viable M. tuberculosis cells, and may provide unique diagnostic markers. Decreased catalase/peroxidase activity, both with and without gene deletion, has been associated with drug-resistant strains. Peptides from these three M. tuberculosis proteins will be used as immunogens for the generation of site-specific monoclonal antibodies (Mabs). Phase I efforts will (1) provide will-characterized Mabs to these M. tuberculosis antigens, and (2) provide initial development of immunoassays utilizing these Mabs. Further development of diagnostic immunoassays, including testing of clinical samples, will occur in Phase II. The production of diagnostic test kits will provide rapid and sensitive methods for screening clinical specimens for M. tuberculosis, a technology that is currently not available.",

We propose to establish a test system based on lipid constituents found in the waxes of Mycobacteria for detection and species identification. The \"signature\" lipids are recovered in sputum, tissue specimens, cerebrospinal fluid, etc., to establish the diagnosis. Components of the Mycobacterial waxes have sufficiently different proportions that they can be used to identify the specific species (which has critical therapeutic implications). Two constituents will be measured. One, tuberulostearic acid is found in the Actinomycetales (of which the Mycobacteria are a part) that can be measured at great sensitivity. The other is a series of multimethyl long chain fatty acids found exclusively in the Mycobacteria. Proportions of mycocersatic acids can be utilized to identify the species of Mycobacteria. These lipids can be quantitatively recovered from clinical specimens and identified chemically without the requirements that the bacteria be isolated and cultured. Application of supercritical fluid extraction (potential one-day sample processing), improved purification methods, with detection by tandem mass spectrometry greatly increase the selectivity and sensitivity (possibly to 6-60 organisms) provide a rapid and quantitative assessment of Mycobacterial infection.

S. Many of the serologic tests currently conducted on wildlife species, particularly ELISA, use animal conjugates developed for domestic animals. Data about wildlife species generated with assays using such heterologous reagents can leave questions about the validity of the results. In addition, there are few known positive and negative sera available for the various wildlife species and disease pathogens. The development of a bank of antisera against the important disease reservoir species and known control sera against the significant zoonotic disease in the U. S. would allow public health investigators at CDC, NIH, and USDA state health and animal agencies, and universities to conduct appropriate serologic tests on wildlife species and properly interpret the results. These antisera and sera could also be used for insect blood meal identification. In the Phase I effort, we plan to develop polyclonal antibodies against immunoglobulins and other blood proteins from a variety of wildlife species which potentially harbor various zoonotic diseases. In addition, we will begin to assemble a bank of positive and negative control reagents from the various host species. In Phase II, we will continue to produce polyclonal antibodies but will also expand the program to include production of monoclonal antibodies as well, and will develop controlled assays to monitor for infection of various species with these diseases.",

Studying polymorphism of GSTs can yield useful information as to individual and tissue responses to toxic or carcinogenic chemicals.

Many of these antibodies are unavailable to laboratories involved in drug metabolism research. Therefore, the goal of Phase I is to produce specific antibodies to the isozymes of GST and to make them commercially available to the research community.

        "abstract": "Taxol is a promising new cancer agent. We will determine whether phosphonium-ion conjugates of taxol would be more effective in a patient-like animal model. It has recently been demonstrated that taxol inhibits the metastatic spread of a PC-3 human prostate tumor cell subline in a SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency) model and processes associated with metastasis (attachment, migration, protease secretion) in vitro. Phosphonium salts are antineoplastic agents that are selectively concentrated in many carcinoma cells relative to untransformed cells and have anticarcinoma activity in animal models due to abnormally high transmembrane potentials of the tumors. We propose the development of taxol-phosphonium conjugates that will be more potent, selective and water-soluble than taxol. These conjugates will consist of triarylalkylphosphonium groups attached through ester linkages to the 2'- or 7- positions of taxol. The overall lipophilicity, weak acidity, and delocalized positive charge of these conjugates will serve to impart greater selectivity and potency due to the high transmembrane potentials of prostate carcinoma cells, in addition to greater water solubility. Two taxol-phosphonium conjugates will be chosen for in vivo metastatic studies on the basis of their potency against PC-3 cell proliferation in vitro, their low toxicity against untransformed cells, their stability in water and mouse serum, and the tolerance of mice to their intraperitoneal administration. Antimetastatic activity will be determined against PC-3 xenografts using the prostate carcinoma MetaMouse model, an orthotopic transplantation model whereby intact human prostate PC-3 tissue is transplanted to the nude-mouse prostate and the resulting tumor grows locally in the prostate and metastasizes, and thereby mimics the clinical properties of human prostate carcinomas (Fu, X., Herrera, H. and Hoffman, R.M. Int. J. Cancer, 52: 987-990, 1992).",

        "abstract": "We are developing a new tumor selective treatment termed antimethionine chemotherapy. Many tumor types have been shown to exhibit an absolute requirement for methionine in vitro in order to proliferate. Normal cells and tissues can utilize homocysteine in place of methionine in order to proliferate. Methionine dependence causes methionine-dependent tumor cells to synchronously arrest in the late-S/G2 phase of the cell cycle. The selective synchronization of tumor cells by methionine deprivation allows the tumor cells to be selectively killed by antitumor drugs such as vincristine when the cell cycle block is alleviated with methionine. In order to bring methionine-dependent chemotherapy closer to the clinic, we will develop assays of methionine dependence with actual tumor specimens put into Collagen sponge-matrix supported histoculture. These assays will be based on biochemical parameters, which involve measurements of S-adenosylmethionine to S-adenosylhomocysteine ratios, and on cell cycle parameters which involve measuring arrest in the cell-cycle as late S/G2 in methionine-free homocysteine-containing medium. These assays will be compared in Phase I to their ability to predict in vitro susceptibility of the tumors to antimethionine chemotherapy based on methionine depletion and subsequent methionine repletion with chemotherapeutic drugs. In Phase II, we will compare the assays ability to predict sensitivity to antimethionine therapy in vivo with the purified methioninase currently produced in our laboratory.",

        "abstract": "We propose to demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating a phototransistor using the A1xGa1-xN material system. The proposed phototransitor is based on a GaN-A1xGa1-xN heterojunction which exhibits a 2-D electron gas conduction when a bias is applied on the source-drain terminals. The device is maintained in a nominally OFF state by applying a reverse bias voltage on the gate terminal. With optical radiation (ultraviolet) incident on the device from the transparent (sapphire) substrate side, electronhole pairs are generated and the device is switched to the ON state due to the reduction in the reverse bias depletion voltage. High electron currents are expected due to the 2-D electron gas conduction implying a large current transfer ratio for the device. Because of the large bandgap of the A1xGa1-xN material system such a phototransistor in principle should be usable in high temperature applications. In Phase I we will prove the feasibility of our technical approach by fabaricating large area devices. In Phase II the devices will be optimized to obtain high speeds and performance levels.",

The detection sensitivity of a system can be enhanced by improving its energy resolution, increasing its area efficiency and/or improving the signal processing electronics. Since the late 1970's, advances have been made in each of these areas so that a new design approach for BAG-X could result in a significant improvement to its detection sensitivity. New packaging approaches for hygroscopic scintillators, which typically offer better energy resolution and area efficiencies to CaF2(Eu), could result in their use in harsh environments which necessitate rugged systems. The ability to build compact, light-weight and powerful electronics for signal processing, on-the-fly background subtraction, etc. offers improvements to both the detection sensitivity and the confidence level that a source is present. In addition, electronics advances have made portable systems easier to use and more intelligent compared to rate meters used 15 years ago. We propose to investigate which of these enhancements can be incorporated into BAG-X and to define a design approiach for a new system.",

The problem actually becomes one of collision avoidance by timing or sequencing the ejection to optimize a clean contact free egress, and controlling the rocket thrust magnitude and/or direction The propsed solution focuses on the monitoring of the multiple ejection seat inertial positions and controlling the sequencing of the seat firing and control of the ejection seat gimbled rocket motors to avoid overlap of the multiple ejection seat envelopes. In order to properly control the gimble or sequence the ejection the seat envelope and relative real time position in 3D space of each seat and the aircraft and possibly the canopy must be known. The control criteria for crash avoidance must be established and finally a detailed knowledge of the ejection platform and projected ejection trajectories will be necessary. It is proposed that each ejection platform, canopy, and aircraft itself be instrumented with a microprosser based acceleration measuring device tracking of each inertial coordinate system as measured relative to the ground. The dosimeters will measure the platform linear and angular accelerations via commercial available sensors, and attitude of each platform. The position information can be compared to the positions of the other monitored platforms and projected ejection envelope or profile. Based on the comparison the ejection sequencing can be altered to maximize impact avoidance, or the rocket thrust vector can be controlled to alter the seat ejection envelope.",

Flexible, weather resistant thermoplastics are used as the bonding matrix for these active fillers. Excellent adhesion to the substrate is attained during the plasma process due to chemical grafting, which is caused by the plasma exposure.

The process can be robotically controlled and is environmentally friendly. A vacuum collection system captures vapors, and no solvents are used in the process. The filters can be functional and contribute to surface hardness and durability. The filters can resist the absorption of chemical agents, and can be tailored to quick release if chemical egents are absorbed. Pigments can be added to assist in achieving coloration close to the environment. Stabilizers can be added to increase durability. Six resins which can be either thermosplastic or thermoset, are included in the proposal. Close attention has been paid to maintaining resistance to thermal shock. Multi-layered coatings can be created. Excellent adhesion between layers is noted.",

Innovative technologies are devised which allow efficient processing of data from multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) systems involving deformable mirrors, electronic signal processing, wavefront sensors, actuator arrays, and other physical elements which comprise the adaptive optics control systems. The project develops tools for acquisition, processing, analysis, display, and management of data associated wtih MIMO systems. The available features allow users to evaluate stability and stability robustness, temporal and spatial response, frequency domain characterizations, inter-channel coupling, noise and uncertainty measures, test excitations, modulation transfer function, Strehl ratios, and other functions useful in testing of adaptive optics control systems. The proposed Adaptive Optics Control System Analyzer (AOCSA) meets the requirements by exploiting and integrating technologies from three areas. First, common algorithms from the signal and image processing theory (Fourier transforms) and their advanced off-shoots, such as coherence functions, are used to ensure quality measurements and correct interpretation of results. Second, the theories and algorithms applicable to adaptive control system performance and stability measures are framed into user interfaces and displays which support the treatment and interpretation of experimental data. Last, the technologies of processors, data acquisition support electronics, commercial executive software environments, and special \"toolbox\" packages are used as the basis for implementing a user-friendly AOCSA.",

Current devices are inflexible and difficult to maintain due to size, complexity, and a dependence of high precision moving parts. This effort will investigate the feasibility of constructing a reliable integrated wavefront sensor suitable to the HEL community and adaptable to other applications. A low maintenance high reliability wavefront analyzer is attainable by integrating innovations from two areas. The first area involves the coupling of commercially available microlenslet technology with modern infrared detector arrays; the resulting compact Hartmann wavefront sensor is a sturdy and adaptable phase and intensity sampling device capable of high spatial and temporal resolution. The second area of innovation encompasses ATA's advanced wavefront reconstruction and wavefront sensor simulation algorithms.

There are no effective finger joint replacements available. Past attempts to produce hinge type joints have failed because the minute pin of the hinge bore all the load placed on the finger leading to its early breakdown. The innovative Arthroflex concept is based on the fact that little load is applied when the fingers are moving. When a load is applied, there is little or no movement. By mounting the pin elastically, loading will cause large mating surfaces on the rigid stems to come in contact, thus taking the load off the pin. This research is to demonstrate feasibility of the Arthroflex concept. Kinematic and finite element analysis (FEA) will be used to analyze forces on joints during normal hand usage. Test data to be produced will be incorporated in the FEA program to formulate the ultimate mechanical design for prototype development and clinical testing during Phase II.",

Much data also exists showing mineralization potentials of other fungi, e.g. Lentinula edodes and Pleurotus sajor-caju, and aromatic ring breakdown capabilities of bacteria such as Aspergillus ustus and Fusarium oxysporum. The proposed work will use ORACLE 6.0 and ORACLE SQL tools to develop a database incorporating all data on TNT degradation with prediction models. ORACLE is a relational database software operating on an entity relationship model. These data will be collected from many sources. Among the several features given emphasis will be sequential degradation with bacteria known to degrade metabolic intermediates used in a Stage II degradation following a Stage I fungal degradation, use of novel sources of degradative organisms known to cleave aromatic rings, elgl sea microbes, cowdung and certain dumpsite cultures, and new organisms not previously studied. The database will be used to arrive at models for prediction of degradation rates under a variety of scenarios. Effect of variables such as pH, temperature, nutrients and soil type for each case will be quantified if possible, Finally, a set of degradation experiments will be outlined for future work based on the database and survey.",

Furthermore, we will fabricate a multi-layer structure, which will consist of an oxidant/thin metal isolation layer/fuel/thick film packaging layer. We will initiate the fuel/oxidant reaction via rupturing thin metal isolation layer by applying voltage across the isolation layer. We will determine the transient time of detonation and the peak stress generated using a high speed photographic technique and x-cut quartz crystals, respectively. In Phase II, we will optimize the configuration of the multi-layer structure for the effective detonation of insensitive high explosives. Parameters to be optimized will be thickness, width and resistivity of the separation layer, and choice of reaction coupling and amount of the reactants to ensure safe and effective detonation of insensitive high explosives.",

THE ENERGY OF THE IONS INCIDENT ON THE SUBSTRATE ARE CONTROLLED BY A GRID ELECTRODE WHICH ALLOWS THEM TO HAVE THE HIGH SURFACE MOBILITY REQUIRED FOR EPITAXIAL GROWTH AT LOW SUBSTRATE TEMPERATURES. SINCE ECR PLASMAS ARE A RICH SOURCE OF IONIC SPECIES, HIGH DEPOSITION RATE SHOULD BE ACHIEVED USING THIS TECHNIQUE. THE LOW SUBSTRATE TEMPERATURES WILL RESULT IN ABRUPT INTERFACES BETWEEN DIFFERENT LAYERS BECAUSE INTERDIFFUSION BETWEEN LAYERS WILL BE GREATLY REDUCED. FURTHERMORE, LOW SUBSTRATE TEMPERATURES ALSO REDUCE THE STRESS DUE TO DIFFERENT THERMAL EXPANSION COEFFICIENTS OF THE SUBSTRATE AND THE GROWING LAYER.

Although more accurate than other existing techniques, mammography's general inability to detect small tumors and other features motivates our study of the Mammograph Display System [MDS]. The MDS is based on the application of wavelets, artificial neural networks, and other advanced signal processing techniques. The MDS will enhance radiologists' perception of mammographic features and improve the accuracy of diagnosis. The Phase I study will lead to significantly enhanced mammogram images which complement existing modalities and allow radiologists to interactively examine diagnostic features. The Phase I study will define a Phase II prototype MDS which will be used in a pre-commercialization clinical testing program. During the Phase I period, we shall demonstrate that wavelets can significantly enhance the visualization of breast carcinomas, improving diagnostic accuracy and the probability of early detection. In addition, we shall demonstrate that this enhanced imaging capability can be achieved in an affordable hardware package.

The validity and processing gain of the method shall be proven on Atlantex ln-Vivo Lead Spectrometer (INVILS) data. The objective is to allow INVILS to quantify lead spectral peaks more accurately with less data. This will reduce x-ray exposure and allow accurate measurement at low lead levels where prior systems were unable to measure. The signal processing algorithm will be composed of four stages: a noise filter, a peak locator, a neural network peak identifier, and a case-based expert system for peak ratios enhancement. The research will also prototype a user friendly window-driven interface. This will enable future versions of INVILS to be employed at different locations such as hospitals, clinics, factories, etc. The device will supplement the use of blood-lead tests and will largely replace the use of provocative chelation testing. INVILS will be used for screening children at high risk of lead poisoning, industrially exposed workers, and for certain classes of the general population, such as those suffering from renal disease.",

The major advantages of our process are: 1) substantial performance gains; 2) the use of a common architecture for multi-sensor platforms; and 3) the need for less hardware for real-time implementation than current state-of-the-art techniques. Our proposed target detection and discrimination process combines two key technologies - morphological signal processing and fractal analysis. We will use geometric constraints (shape) as a first order filter for discriminating man-made objects from the natural cluttered background. This will be followed by a second step of processing (false alarm reduction and detection prioritization) which will exploit the difference in the fractal behavior of natural clutter vs. man-made objects. Both stages of the algorithm will be implemented using non-linear morphological filters, which require many fewer numerical operations than conventional signal processing algorithms. As a result we will achieve high computational efficiency and increased processing speed. For Phase I demonstration we will focus on one aspect of the Theater Missile Defense scenario. This approach offers a fast, low-cost, low-power common hardware implementation for the detection and discrimination of targets in multi-sensor data.",

This new computationally efficient processing methodology has been shown to provide significant better detection/discrimination results in single-band long wave FLIR imagery as well as in the acoustic, SAR and visible optics domains. Atlantic Aerospace has emerged as the technical leader in developing and applying this technology to defense-related problem areas. We believe that the same generic approach appropriately modified to reflect the structural and textural characteristics of high value targets and typical backgrounds in multi-band IR imagery, will provide significant new capability and substantial performance gains for automatic target acquisition. In this Phase I program wwe will utilize our previously develooped morphology-based detection algorithm, that applies both size and amplitude constraints at the pixel level, to identify potential areas of interest in multi-band IR imagery. For each of the detected areas we will perform fractal analysis independently in the available spectral bands. Our analysis methods will include the evaluation of fractal and high order signatures. The potential capability of the developed measures to automatically cue an operator or a fully automated process to areas of high value targets will be demonstrated. Although the primary interest of this Phase I program is on developing fractal-based measures for the discrimination of man-made objects from natural backgrounds, we will also analyze large patches of natural background and characterize their fractal properties in each spectral band. The emphasis will be on parameterization most appropriate for scene generation.",

        "abstract": "Because narrowband submarines emissions are constantly being reduced, one is forced to use broadband information to detect and track, still relying upon narrowband tonal energy for classification. In addition, broadband energy frominterfering sources such as biologics or profilers can clutter LOFARGRAM displays. As a result existing LOFARGRAM methods are of limited utility for quiet threats operating in high clutter environments (e.g., shallow water). We propose to demonstrate new signal processing methods that will allow existing LOFARGRAM techniques and displays to be used for 1) the detection of submarinetransients, and 2) to the discrimination of quiet submarine signatures from strong ocean clutter. Our approach is based on using directional, coherent beamforming techniques to increase the signal-to-noise ratios pf possible targets, thereby exposing the narrowband signals and tonals that would otherwise be masked by the ocean noise. Beam steering information will be derived from the initial detection of transient energy which will also be accomplished via the LOFARGRAM through the use of advanced image enhancement pre-processing techniques. The follow-on Phase II program will produce a prototype preprocessor to be used in conjunction with an existing LOFARGRAM system, as a vehicle for Navy operational personnel to evaluate the effectiveness of this technology.",

The proposed baseline antenna concept consists of four major components: a two-dimential antenna array of polarization-diverse radiating elements, a dual purpose elevation feed, an active Rotman lens azimuth feed and an azimuth beam steering network. Use of the active Rotman lens (\"Wide Instantaneous Bandwidth Active Scanned Array\", proposal dtd 5 Feb '92, submitted by Atlantic Aerospace Electronics Corp. to Harry Diamond Laboatory BAA ACT Committee) and a p-i-n diode switch beam steering network (\"Low Cost Conformal Electronically Scanned Array\", final report dtd 20 Sept '91, prepared by Atlantic Aerospace Electronics Corp. for Harry Diamond Laboratory under contract number DAALO2-91-C-0055) has been evaluated for radar antenna applications in the referenced earlier work and will not be considered in further detail in this proposal. The polarization-diverse elements will consist of dual-input elements with an integrated MMIC switch module to select vertical, horizontal, right-hand and left-hand circular polarizations. The elements will reside in a two-dimentional array such that each vertical, or elevation, column has a dual-mode selectable feed and all columns are fed in azimuth by the output ports of the Rotman lens. The selectable elevation feed will be designed to switch between two pattern modes: fixed cosecant-squared and monopulse. The azimuth feed distribution will be such as to achieve peak sidelobe levels of 25db below the main beam. System performance will be quantified by predictions of antenna patterns at different frequencies (5% about 16Ghz), azimuth scan angles (within + or - 45 deg.), elevation beam modes and polarization selections.",

The system will enable users to quantify easily, quickly, and accurately various retinal lesions from retinal images. Lesions such as macular drusen exudates, cotton wool spot, hemorrhages, and aneurysms will be detected in a fully automated manner; thus, the detection of such problems will eliminate the need for operator decision inherent in previously developed systems. The detection and segmentation of lesions will be accomplished through sophisticated application of Mathematical Morphology directly to gray scale images. This methodology enables the enforcement of both brightness and size (of the lesions) constraints in the detection process. The approach's feasibility will be investigated in Phase I by developing the detection/segmentation techniques needed to analyze drusen and by comparing the reproducibility achieved to the reproducibility obtained with previous semi-automatic and manual grading methods. In Phase II of this project the techniques will be extended to many other lesions. In addition, we will develop, implement and test techniques to characterize the distribution of lesions and their spatial organization. Methods to register retinal images taken at different times will be developed and used to characterize the changes in lesions over time.",

The 2D information is used to quantify the dimensions, volume, centroid, and location of the cloud. Phase I tasks will mainly include: a review of previous work particularly within DoD and in related applications such as meteorology; an analysis of application requirements; an investigation and limited prototyping of required image processing/analysis approaches. This will include proposing and evaluating image segmentation schemes that can reliably identify image regions corresponding to cloud cover, approaches for region or boundary representation and description, and extraction of geometric/topological features or other 2D measures such as cloud density. The Phase I prototyping will be performed on state-of-the-art image processing/analysis workstations implemented on standard computer platforms. Videotaped images will be used for testing the prototypes and evaluating the applicability and feasibility of the proposed schemes. On the basis of the Phase I results, needs for future R&D will be identified and the Phase II effort will be planned.",

        "abstract": "The primary goals of the Phase I research plan are to develop a prototype absorbable stent for use in mid-tubal reanastomosis and to evaluate the effectiveness of this device in a rabbit experimental model. Mechanical design criteria will be determined by making measurements of luminal caliber and tubal compliance in freshly excised rabbit oviducts. The stent will be designed to 1) accommodate disparate luminal sizes, 2) be easily inserted, 3) to resist longitudinal displacement once inserted, 4) be atraumatic to intraluminal mucosa, 5) facilitate anastomotic stitching, 6) allow normal flow of tubal fluid into the abdomen, and 7) be absorbed in approximately the time required for healing of the anastomosis. To meet this design criteria, the tubular stents will be fabricated out of polygycoloic acid (PGA). Prototype stents will be used to perform simulated reanastomosis in 20 rabbits after excision of the ampullo-isthmic junction. In each rabbit, the contralateral tube will be anastomosed by using standard microsurgical techniques and will serve as an internal control. Groups of five rabbits will be used to evaluate rate of healing and rate of absorption of the PGA stent at times ranging from one to 10 weeks after surgery. Stent effectiveness will be compared to that of standard microsurgical techniques in terms of duration of surgery, degree of abnormal morphology at the anastomotic site, and, in one group of five animals, restoration of fertility determined by the nidation index. Data on rate of healing and rate of PGA absorption will be analyzed by using regression analysis. Data on morphology and fertility will be analyzed by using a paired t-test to test for differences between the two anastomotic procedures.In Phase II we plan to develop additional devices to facilitate other varieties of tubal reconstruction, evaluate these new designs in experimental animal models, and test successful designs in clinical trials. Our overall goal is to provide devices that will improve the effectiveness and reduce the skill, time and cost of tubal reconstructive surgery, thereby contributing to overall improvement of female infertility therapy.",

However, today's simulators require the use of physical mock-ups of the controls and displays for each of the crew stations in order for the human operators to control the simulated vehicles. These mock-ups are expensive and time consuming to produce, and difficult to reconfigure to test new concepts. Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to enable the construction of \"virtual crew stations\" allowing test and evaluation to be performed without the need for constructing expensive physical mock-ups.

The current SBIR Project addresses a complementary digital electronics controller of small size, low weight, low power consumption and, at the same time, improved dynamic performance and robustness, by virtue of its being based on advanced control methodologies. The design approach concentrates on LQR, LQG, and H control methodologies because they provide performance improvement without incurring excess hardware and software complexity. Fault tolerance is obtained by the system architecture and reconfigurability, consistent with modern, integrated modular avionics, system concepts. The output of Phase I is the selection of a control methodology, design of the corresponding algorithm and the preliminary design of a controller, including top level circuit design. The selected design will be experimentally evaluated using a turbine engine magnetic bearing testbed being developed by AVCON (Contract F33615-91-C-2114).

        "abstract": "There are 300 million people in the world who are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). Available therapies for the elimination of HBV infection often have a transient effect only. These therapies do not specifically target HBV, and this, in part, is a basis for their limited and variable performances. We will seek to develop targeted antiviral drugs with a particular emphasis on HBV. The product of the HBV pol gene has a central role in viral replication. It has a complex of functions which include reverse transcription, RNase H, DNA priming, and DNA synthesis. Such unique and essential functions make it a prime target for prospective anti-HBV drugs. This program proposes to seek pol gene-associated activities in soluble products from host cells transformed with expression vectors that contain appropriate constructs prepared from the HBV pol gene. These enzymatically active peptides will be used to develop microwell-formatted quantitative assays. Further developments will take these assays into automated high- throughput systems for use in large-scale screening of compounds with prospective inhibitory activity. Such inhibitors, once identified and characterized, will form the bases for the development of targeted anti-HBV drugs.",

The aircraft maneuvers from an initial state vector at a given initial time to a final state vector at a given or optimiized final time. The final state is achieved in a manner that minimizes cost functions such as the time integral of induced drag. This is a classical problem in variational calculus, but until recently there has been no practical means for initializing the co-state differential equations of the calculus. This proposal presents a new method for this initialization that uses artificial neural networks trained off-line on simulated optimum solutions. The method is realizable in airborne systems without large computational capabilities. Phase I work will remove the remaining technical obstactles and demonstrate the method via simulations of an advanced aircraft controlled in complex maneuvering. A control synthesis tool that can be used by the entire flight control community will be fully developed in Phase II. The proposed method is called a \"unified control concept\" because it provides solutions for nonlinear and time varying flight conditions, employs neural network based adaptive control, and provides analytically derived designs for rate, attitude, and position control laws.",

The goal of a biocompatible, low loss, high laser damage threshold, sterilizable, flexible, thermally stable fiber, with good visible transmission for the aim beam seems most realizable in non-traditional oxide glasses. The aim is to develop the technical base necessary for Phase II production of prototype fibers in sufficient quantities to allow evaluation in the field. A further aim is to provide fibers at a cost of $10-20/m; thus, the system is allowing disposable delivery systems to be used. Specifically the Phase I research effort will focus on finding the region of glass formation in a selection of aluminate, titanate and tantalate systems. Thermal, mechanical, chemical and optical properties will be measured and some compositions selected on this basis for large size melt production for bulk and fiber damage and attenuation measurements.",

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE BASIC TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY OF THE MRANS CONCEPT. THIS IS BEING ACCOMPLISHED BY PERFORMING THE FOLLOWING THREE TASKS: (1) DESIGN AND ASSEMBLE AN MRANS-TYPE HYDROGEN ION SOURCE; (2) PERFORM PULSED EXPERIMENTS TO DEMONSTRATE AND CHARACTERIZE HIGH-EFFICIENCY ATOMIC ION EXTRACTION; AND (3) DEVELOP THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN TO DELIVER NEUTRON FLUXES IN THE RANGE OF 10(12) TO 10(13) N/S.",

We will utilize a novel DNA expression vector (HK1) capable of directing high-level tissue-specific expression from keratinocytes in the epidermis. The HK1 vector contains transcription and translation control elements derived from the human K1 gene. In transgenic animals, this vector directs high levels of gene expression specifically in proliferative basal cells as well as differentiated supra-basal cells of the epidermis. Phase-I studies will focus on demonstrating the feasibility of expressing therapeutic products in normal and hyperplastic skin after direct administration of the HK1 vector into the epidermis by particle bombardment. We will study expression of a marker gene beta-galactosidase as well as TGF-beta, a growth regulating factor which may be useful in inhibiting hyperproliferation in diseases such as psoriasis. We will study gene expression in normal mice and in the transgenic HK-1-TGF-alpha mouse where genetically engineered overexpression of TGF-alpha induces thickening, hyperproliferation, and hyperkeratosis of the skin similar to that seen in psoriasis. Phase-II studies will focus on developing novel methods for gene delivery to skin, expression in human epidermal models, and the development of new gene medicines for treating the hyperproliferation and inflammation characteristic of psoriasis.",

Our approach begins with a novel method of preparing polymeric precursor fibers, which is based on existing technolog now being commercialized for other applications by Bend Research. The precursor fibers will then be heat-treated, carbonized, and activated using existing, proven techniques, we believe this process offers a high probability for success. Successful completion of hte Phase I program and a subsequent Phase II should lead to domestic production of activated-carbon fibers that are technically superior to those currently available overseas and that are less expensive to produce.

In deep water, the proposed array can be positioned in the sound channel to detect submerged vessel movements or deliberately activated acoustic signals.

We have proven expertise in small arry construction techniques that assure high reliability.

A major requirement is to provide a high force capability in the high power desity package and have it be applicable to a bandwidth of 1000 to 4000 Hz. Among the candidates are ceramic, ceramic composite, magnetosrtictive and electroreological fluid technology. While existing systems can produce high forces, the weight and size of these systems is far too great to be useful. Benthos, a leader in the development and manufacture of piezoelectric driven devices, in corporation with other engineering specialists in high power density actuators, proposes to develop two high force actuators using piezoeletric and magnetostrictive actuators. Each of these will be tailored to optimize their force/weight properties, and will be tested side by side to determine the optimum configuration for the application. The objective of the study is to develop a working prototype of two tested, highly reliable actuator materials in a configuration which will be as close to a working model as feasible in this first phase. From the results of the subsequent analysis, a design will be submitted for a refined version of the actuator to be built and tested in anticipation of the FSD phase of the project.",

OUR PROPOSED METHOD WILL BE BASED ON THE USE OF ANTIBODIES WHICH DIFFERENTIALLY BIND TO X AND Y SPERM CELLS FROM A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT FISH. PREPARATIONS OF FUNCTIONALLY-X SPERM WILL BE PREPARED BY MASCULINIZATION OF GYNOGENETICALLY PRODUCED FEMALES; FUNCTIONALLY-Y SPERM WILL BE PREPARED BY FEMINIZATION OF OFFSPRING AND SUBSEQUENT MATING OF INDIVIDUALS TO NORMAL MALES. RABBIT POLYCLONAL ANTIBODIES WILL BE GENERATED AGAINST EACH OF THE ISOLATED SPERM SAMPLES. TITERS WILL BE ASSESSED, AND POTENTIALLY USEFUL ANTIBODIES WILL BE ISOLATED AND CHARACTERIZED FOR THEIR SPECIFICITY. IN PHASE II OF THIS PROJECT, THE ANTIBODIES PRODUCED IN PHASE I WILL BE MORE COMPLETELY CHARACTERIZED AND WILL BE USED TO DEVELOP STRATEGIES TO SEGREGATE FUNCTIONALLY-X AND FUNCTIONALLY-Y SPERM.",

        "abstract": "Chemiluminescent (CL) reactions suffer from low quantum yields because of competing dark reaction pathways; this can be overcome, if the excited state emitter can be stabilized. A monoclonal antibody raised against an appropriately designed target structure (one that closely resembles the excited state emitter) may serve as a surrogate binding molecule. The resultant enhanced CL can then be extremely useful in a variety of applications, e. g. immunoassays. The luminol peroxide reaction is one of the most widely utilized CL reactions. If the antibodies are raised against 3-aminophthalate (APA), then the excited state emitter can be expected to enhance CL yield. In Phase I efforts, several monoclonal antibodies to the APA hapten will be developed, and their usefulness as CL enhancers will be examined. Additionally, anti- APA IgM secreting clones developed in earlier efforts will be manipulated to generate anti-APA IgG antibodies. The usefulness of all these antibodies will also be examined in the related isoluminol reaction. In Phase II studies, a larger bank of catalytic antibodies for these CL reactions as well as other reactions such as the acridinium ester reaction will be generated. The usefulness of all these catalytic antibodies in prototype immunoassays will also be examined, thus paving the way for commercial exploitation.",

However, no suitable methods exist that allow investigation of their pharmacokinetics in human subjects or in vivo measurement of the ratio of intracellu- lar/extracellular 10B at the time of irradiation. A new approach based on the use of stable isotopes of B is proposed for these purposes. During Phase I, the analytical chemistry of the method focusing on accurate measurement of stable isotopes 10B and 11B in fluids and tissues from humans and animals will be developed. Using this method, pharmacokinetics of selected boronated compounds will be investigated in a laboratory rat during Phase II. A new method based on the concept of in vivo isotope dilution coupled with the measurement of bromine space will be developed which will permit in vivo measurement of the ratio intracellular/extracellular 10B. The accuracy of this method will be tested against methods based on chemical analysis of carcass. During Phase III, the aggregate of this methodology will be employed to investigate pharmacokinetics of boronated drugs that are candidates for human use and to develop 10B-administration protocols for optimizing the ratio of intracellular/extracellular 10B at the time of irradiation. Since major advances are being made in development of promising boronated drugs, both private sector and public agencies will become active in development, marketing, and research related to this therapeutic mode. Thus, significant need will be generated for studies requiring accurate measurement of B in various tissues and fluids and in the use of the stable isotope methodology developed in the research. We expect to be able to act as an international center for collaborative investigations based on our methods.",

Recent advances by BIODE in the design and operation of APM devices have resulted in a DNA hybridization sensor principle with excellent sensitivity (nanograms/milliliter), selectivity and temperature stability when used with a model probe system.

We will also attempt the direct electronic in situ sensing of a diagnostically significant DNA gene sequence, which codes for the abundant late matrix antigen of Cytomegalovirus. A known short-coming of the previous work is the need to denature naturally-occurring dsDNA to single strands before the sensor is able to detect it.

        "abstract": "Of the several protein elastomers - elastin, resilin, abduction, titin and twitchin- the elastomer with the greatest demonstrated durability is elastin. It is perhaps no coincidence that elasting is also most hydrophobic, as durability and hydrophobicity may be coupled. Also, greater hydrophobicity makes elastin-based elastomers of greater potential utilization alone and particularly in combination with traditional synthetic elastomers. Furthermore, elastin-based elastomers can be prepared with a wide range of elastic moduli for a correspondingly wide range of applications. The objective of this basic research Phase I SBIR is chemically to synthesize three subsets of a family of model protein elastomers patterned after the dominant repeating elastic sequence of elastin. The approach in the design of the three subsets is systematically to increase hydrophobicity, yet retain the capacity to form structure by coacervation; to increase hydrophobicity in a manner that enhances cross-linking by y-irradiation; to increase hydrophobicity in a way that introduces pressure effects and shock sbsorbing properties; and to prepare elastomers with the potential for a range of elastic moduli. The protein-based elastomers are to become more similar to, yet distinct from, traditional synthetic elastomers with respect to the properties to be examined. Those physical characterizations are to determine barrier properties, solvent swelling and flexibility at low temperatures.",

Despite continuing interest in the development of polymers, both synthetic and natural, (over a 25-year period), there is yet a need for suitable materials for drug delivery. Such materials would have significant and broad clinical applications including continuous and/or localized delivery of existing therapeutic agents as well as delivery systems for the new proteinaceous agents resulting from genetic engineering. The elastomeric polypeptides utilized in this work are a unique class of polymers designed from repeat sequences which occur in native elastin. These materials are particularly suited for this application since they are constructed of natural amino acids arranged in sequences which occur throughout the body. All data to date indicates the parent polypentapeptide and its gamma-irradiated cross-linked matrix to be biocompatible and totally innocuous. This current data includes the eleven recommended generic biological tests as well as muscle and intraperitoneal implant studies. Our understanding of the science of these materials has progressed to the point that polymers can be designed which exhibit a set of specified physical characteristics. Initial results indicate that the rate of degradation and/or swelling of these matrices could be modulated by the inclusion of various chemical clocks located both within the backbone and side chains. Phase I of this proposal will produce monolith slabs will extend the in vitro studies on controlling the rate of degradation and release of therapeutic agents from these matrices. Phase II will involve studies of degradation and agent release in animal models and biological testing of the materials developed in Phase I.",

Such scarring often produces significant restriction to eye movement and malposition of the eyes. The polypeptide, which has already been shown to prevent scar formation in a rabbit experimental model, is now formed in sheets and large tubes. The polypeptide will be modified by the inclusion of ester bonds and chemical clocks to facilitate its degradation in the subconjunctival space. Such a material should have significant clinical application, particularly in reoperation procedures for strabismus and retinal detachment surgery involving the extraocular muscles.

        "abstract": "The long term objective is to develop a multichannel, diagnostic instrumentation system for recording the physiology of the non-pregnant human uterus. The current prototype can simultaneously record combinations of six physiologic parameters: electrical activity at the cervix, electrical activity inside the uterus, pressure changes inside the uterus, mean flow velocity in a uterine artery, subject report of pain/cramps intensity, and pulse delay by EKG. Patented innovations are a non-invasive, cervical electrode cup for recording cervix/corpus electrical activity and a non-invasive, vaginal Doppler probe for continuous recording of uterine artery flow velocity. Specific aims are to record a series of normals and patients with chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and endometriosis, to determine the feasibility of also recording the fetal EKG, and to improve the crystal rotation mechanism in the Doppler probe. This system has multiple potential applications as a research tool for studies of human reproduction and as a diagnostic instrument for clinical gynecology. The pool of patients who might benefit is extensive: chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and endometriosis alone afflicts nearly 50% of the 45 million of reproductive age in the U. S.",

        "abstract": "The challenge of predicting the toxic potential of chemicals has been met in the last few years by the development of sophisticated structure-activity methodologies. However, most of the endpoints studied dealt with in vitro or whole animal effects. The challenge presented by the RFP is to extend the scope of the methodologies to address the organ specific toxicity of chemicals. This is now made possible because the organ specific toxicity of a variety of chemicals has been assessed over the years at the NIEHS. Rationalization of this data could lead to a better understanding of the factors that govern local toxicity, and possibly yield enough information to predict the organ specific toxicity of untested compounds. We will use the Multiple Computer Automated Structure Evaluation (Multi-CASE) method to analyze the data gathered by NIEHS. Structural databases of increasing size and complexity will be analyzed to identify biophores, the chemical substructural features probably responsible for the endpoints tested. These biophores will be used to create predictive models for each of the endpoints that, in turn, will be validated using standard statistical techniques. Phase I will demonstrate the project's feasibility by completing the analysis of two distinct endpoints selected as representative of the problem.",

        "abstract": "X-ray computed tomography (CT) is widely used in defense, aerospace, and industrial applications. CT provides flaw detection, density measurement, accurate dimensions, morphology, assembly verification, material property analysis, and other vauable information. However, a major limitation of CT has been the inspection time required for 100% coverage of an object, since a single slice through the object usually requires several minutes. One promising technique to overcome this limitation is volume computed tomography (VCT). Instead of acquiring only a single slice from the object, VCT employs an area detector to collect hundreds of slices per exposure. VCT has been demonstrated in the laboratory as a promising NDE technique, but the limitations of area x-ray detectors and system costs above $1,000,000 have prevented any significant commercial applications. We propose to demonstrate the feasibility of a completely new concept of VCT, which overcomes the limitations of area detectors and conventional x-ray sources. This concept uses a raster scanned area x-ray source and a single, tightly collimated solid state detector. In addition to performing fast VCT, this approach will produce higher quality images than current VCT, since it eliminates the scattered x-ray signal at the detector.",

        "abstract": "We propose to develop in this Phase I SBIR a technique to produce high-energy, multi-aspect radiographic images in near real-time, using a conventional real time radiography (RTR) system. This technique, stereo-pair imaging, will allow three-dimensional analysis of RTR images by producing two views, at different angles, of the object being inspected. The separate views will be generated by taking one view, rotating the object a small angle using the RTR system manipulator, and then taking the second view. The two views are displayed separately to each eye through a viewing adaptor; the operator's visual cortex easily combines the views to provide the inherent depth and positional information. The propsoed approach is much simpler and less expensive than other stereo-pair approaches such as the use of a dual focal spot x-ray source. The only modifications that will need to be made to the RTR system are the addition of soem software and the viewing adaptor. During Phase I we will optimize the design of the technique, write data acquisition software, and produce 3-D images for demonstration. In Phase II we will refine the software and develop the viewing adaptor, which will be available as an inexpensive upgrade to compatible RTR systems.",

The structure for surgery or biopsy can be used further in accurate location of features with respect to the patient. A single interface box will allow use of these individual coils with an MRI scanner. Especially for patients who are difficult to image with x-ray mammography, recent work with contrast-enhanced MRI has demonstrated high sensitivity and good specificity in breast imaging for cancer detection.

Following tooth extraction, the edentulous ridge begins to resorb thus reducing the bone available for implant therapy. Implant placement at the time of tooth loss may allow early restoration and preserve remaining bone. Present implant designs require viable bone at the site's apex or bone replacement materials to provide initial implant stability. Apical bone requirements limit candidate sites and bone replacement materials may impede osseous healing. The proposed endosseous implants use proven masonry fastener technology to adjust their outer diameter, allowing them to contact bone from crest to apex of an extraction site, block epithelial downgrowth and provide initial implant stability.

The Ras family of oncogenes and proto-oncogenes encode guanine nucleotide binding proteins that participate in the control of eukaryotic cell proliferation. Ras proteins are modified posttranslationally by transfer of a farnesyl moiety to specific cysteine residues. This transformation is mediated by a farnesyl:protein transferase (farnesyltransferase). Farnesylation is a prerequisite for oncogenic transformation. There is a convincing body of evidence indicating that inhibition of Ras farnesylation is an important point for pharmacological intervention in Ras function. We will 1) Design and synthesize novel inhibitors of farnesyltransfer- ase, and 2) evaluate the new compounds as inhibitors of farnesyltransferase in an in vitro assay.

Preliminary measurements have been made through ~1mm of mouse skin and in 1.4mm phantoms, using dyes similar to those used in PDT. With improved apparatus, our goal is several millimeters penetration. LHI measures intensity-modulated fluorescence originating from the heterodyning of two laser beams in a small intersection volume; thus, it permits localized measurement. That fluorescence is modulated at the beat frequency of the two beams (40MHz). Heterodyning discriminates against interfering background fluorescence; therefore, it permits measurements at depth even through highly turbid biological tissue. LHI can enhance the diagnostic capabilities of Laser Induced Fluorescence by determining tumor boundaries in three dimensions. Our specific aims are (1) to compare the capabilities of LHI with established clinical techniques through a graded set of experiments (using animal tissue in vitro and in vivo and concluding with an animal model for basal cell carcinoma), (2) to investigate the effect of scattering on performance (attainable depth), (3) to investigate the possibility of using endogenous fluorescent agents, and (4) to define a Phase II prototype to measure skin cancer and sub-surface soft tissue neoplasya in human subjects.",

        "abstract": "The US Navy has identified a need to accurately attack ground targets with weapons delivered from advanced high-altitude aircraft. The high altitude bombing concept affords enhanced aircraft survivability since weapons can be released beyond the range of ground-based enemy air defenses even when operating near the target area. However, to ensure accurate guidance to the target area and ultimately a high probability-of-kill, such weapons are expected to be equipped with an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a GPS receiver, and possibly a narrow field-of-view seeker. Consequently, in order to realize a high-performance, cost effective system, it is anticipated that state-of-the-art sensor configurations and innovative IMU transfer alignment algorithms will be required to optimize the high-altitude bombing concept. The focus of this proposed research is to: (1) identify candidate state-of-the-art sensors for high-altitude aircraft/weapon systems, (2) postulate and evaluate innovative aircraft/weapon sensor configurations, and (3) conduct tradeoff analyses to characterize the feasibility of the candidate configurations. Detailed mathematical models will be formulated to characterize the error behavior of each sensor, and representative aircraft and weapon flight trajectories will be generated. Candidate configurations consisting of alternative aircraft/weapon sensors, aircraft-to-weapon transfer alignment procedures, and weapon midcourse guidance aiding schemes (e.g., GPS-aiding) will be postulated. The candidate configurations will be embedded into a computer simulation which will be employed to generate weapon system alignment error, navigation error, and seeker pointing error time-histories. Based on these projected errors, performance/risk/cost tradeoff analyses will be conducted for each candidate configuration. The most promising configurations will be selected for in-depth analyses to be conducted under the subsequent Phase II effort.",

There is a need for solvent-resistant microorganisms for use in a variety of such applications, including bioremediation, waste treatment, and biocatalysis. We propose to isolate and develop solvent-resistant microorganisms which could be used for these purposes. Microorganisms capable of growth in the present of 10% (v/v) organic solvent will be isolated by enrichment culture techniques, and through mutagenesis and selection. The catabolic abilities and solvent-resistance of these isolates will be characterized. We intend to clone the genes conferring solvent resistance in these organisms. This will allow rapid development of a wide range of solvent-resistant microbes for bioprocessing applications. The genes will also be placed in other microorganisms whichhave specific metabolic capabiities, thereby enhancing their utility. We will initiate studies dealing withthe physiological basis of microbial solvent resistance. The goal of the Phase I research is to demonstrate that solvent-resistant microorganisms can be isolated, and to begin genetic and biochemical investigations on the basis of this resistance. The long-term goal is the development of technology for rapid creation of solvent-resistant microorganisms for use in a number of commercial applications of interest to both the Department of Defense and the private sector.",

Biosensor systems of this type, because of their inherent sensitivity, are uniquely suited for the specific and selective detection of low levels of toxic compounds. Phase I research will focus on the feasibility of adapting a mercury biosensor, previously developed for environmental monitoring, to blood and urine. The luminescent response to mercury will be quantified, and the biosensors' sensitivity, range of response, and selectivity will be characterized. Additional effort will be directed toward ongoing development of other sensors, including sensors for arsenic, lead, and cadmium. Phase II research will develop a prototype commercial system to screen blood and urine for evidence of acute and long-term exposure to specific toxins.

        "abstract": "We have developed an ultrasensitive quantitation system which can be used with a large family of isotopes. This system supports label multiplexing; many co-resident isotopes in the family can be quantitated simultaneously. This process allows either the pooling of labeled samples or the pooling of distinctly labeled probe reagents for multiple targets. The research will add two dimensional (2D) spatial resolution to the capabilities of the system in support of nucleic acid quantitation and fractionation, including sequencing. Because of the extensive multiplexing capabilities and superior sensitivity, the proposed technique will greatly increase sample throughput in fraction- ation/quantitation tasks.",

        "abstract": "Retroviruses are universally recognized as human and animal pathogens that induce severe diseases. Because of their remarkable high frequency of genetic recombination retroviral, genomes result in a high level of polymorphisms. Such plasticity originates variants that are resistant to drugs or vaccines. The current treatments for retroviral infection are not effective because they do not inactivate retroviruses, and most of the drugs and vaccines are toxic to cells and produce severe side effects. Therefore, the need to develop a new strategy to interfere with viral infection and replication is urgent. Thus, the main goal is to develop a new in vitro model system in mammalian cell lines that could be resistant to retroviral infection and possibly other viruses. We will accomplish this goal by constructing and introducing into mammalian cells an expression vector that contains an inducible mammalian retroviral promoter fused to a hybrid gene. The hybrid gene will harbor the yeast Ty retrotransposon containing the TYA region and a fragment of the TYB region. These regions, coding for the capsid protein required for virus-like particle (VLP) formation and a protease, respectively, will be fused to the coding region of the enzyme Staphylococcal nuclease which is calcium dependent and inactivates viral nucleic acids.",

        "abstract": "Contamination and accumulation of xenobiotics (i. e., environmental toxins, chemical carcinogens, mutagens) in critical domestic and industrial water sources and natural reservoirs pose a significant health risk to humans and animals. While conventional methods to detect the presence of xenobiotics are available, they are not sensitive, they have to be complemented with other assays, and they are not designed to detect the pathobiological effects caused by exposure of organisms to sublethal levels of xenobiotics. Therefore, the development of a transgenic model for monitoring environmental xenobiotics is fundamental. Thus, the objective of Phase I is to construct a vector containing the luciferase reporter gene, fused to the regulatory elements (promoter) of the P1-450 gene of rainbow trout, and introduce the vector into fish hepatoma cell lines. The activation of the P1-450 regulatory elements by chemical carcinogens will be assessed by the enzymatic activity of luciferase and will be used as a molecular tool to evaluate sublethal levels of numerous polycyclic aromatic chemicals. These studies will constitute the basis to construct transgenic fish (Phase II) carrying the P450 promoter-luciferase fusion vector to assess toxins and polycyclic aromatic compounds capable of inducing toxicity and carcinogenesis. Thus, transgenic fish will serve as novel biological indicators of environmental xenobiotics.",

        "abstract": "We will develop a rapid, specific, sensitive, and homogeneous detection system based on DNA amplification for the diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis infections in symptomatic as well as asymptomatic individuals. Chlamydia trachomatis is a major human pathogen responsible for a wide range of infections including lymphogranuloma venereum, trachoma, inclusion conjunctivitis and genital tract infections. The rapid identification of chlamydia infections is, therefore, essential for the proper treatment of infected patients and for the prevention of transmission to susceptible individuals. Presently used tests for C. trachomatis are either too slow, not sufficiently sensitive, very laborious, or susceptible to cross contamination. A homogeneous system based on DNA amplification and concomitant detection (SEConD amplification system) has been developed in Biotronics Corps. In Phase I, we will develop the amplification and detection primers for the SEConD amplification using the cloned C. trachomatis plasmid and genomic DNA sequences as targets. In Phase II, we will adapt this assay for direct detection of C. trachomatis in various clinical samples. Finally, we will perform a study to compare our assay with current protocols for C. trachomatis detection, i. e., cell culture method and direct fluorescent antibody techniques, and implement the methodology as a standard clinical assay.",

Refreshable braille devices are now available, and by using them to read the information on the monitor screen, blind computer operators can interact with their computers more efficiently than they do when they must rely upon speech synthesizers for the display of information. Unfortunately, the refreshable braille displays now available are so expensive that all but a few are denied access to them. The research conducted by Blazie Engineering over the last two years strongly supports the possibility of building pneumatically operated refreshable braille devices. The refreshable braille devices are more reliable and significantly less expensive than the refreshable braille devices now available.

        "abstract": "The main objective of the research is to develop a new class of topoisomerase II (Topo II) inhibitors as antineoplastic agents. In preliminary studies, heterocyclic amine-carboxyboranes have been shown to possess cytotoxic activity against a number of murine and human tumor tissue culture lines, e. g. P388, L1210, Tmolt3, HeLa-S3, lung bronchogenic, KB nasopharynx, glioma, and osteosarcoma. These compounds have been shown to inhibit HeLa-S3 Topo II at 100 mu M concentration, but have not been tested below this concentration. The Phase I objectives are to synthesize a larger selection of amine-carboxyboranes and to evaluate the effect of Lewis base moiety on biological activity. Studies will be performed to determine in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo antitumor activity of these compounds. Mode of action studies will be limited to Topo II inhibition, inhibition of DNA synthesis, and DNA stability in Phase I. Phase II studies will concentrate further on structure-activity relationship with the help of molecular modeling. In addition, detailed mode of action, acute toxicity, tissue disposition, and pharmacokinetic parameters will be determined. The project is expected to result in the identification and development of one or more potent antineoplastic agents to treat one or more human tumors.",

The cyanoboronated bases may be designed to be more membrane soluble than the respective 2'- deoxyribonucleosides of known cytotoxic activities. In living organisms, these base derivatives may be converted to the 5'-nucleotides according to salvage pathways, even in cases when the respective 2'- deoxyribonucleosides are poor substrates for nucleoside kinases. Therefore, the cyanoboronated bases are expected to show better cytotoxic activities than the cyanoboronated 2'-deoxyribonucleosides and are feasible to use as antineoplastic agents. An additional importance is the potential for the compounds to be used in boron neutron capture therapy for the treatment of cancer. A rationale for the general synthetic approach to cyanoboronated nucleic acid bases is presented.",

        "abstract": "A major problem with the use of nucleoside phosphates as antiviral and antitumor drugs has been their inability to penetrate cell membranes. Additionally, nucleoside phosphates are susceptible to phosphatases and nucleases, which reduce their in vivo life time. Replacement of the charged phosphate group with uncharged boron containing moieties should not only enhance their cell permeability, but the new analogs are expected to be resistant to phosphatases and nucleases. The long term objective is to synthesize boronated nucleoside phosphates as analogs of normal or sugar modified nucleosides. These compounds may be prepared by two methods: 1) by direct modification of a nucleoside, or 2) by attachment of a modified sugar moiety to the base. The Phase I effort will mainly concentrate on the synthesis of an analog of acyclovir monophosphate and to develop methods that may be utilized for the synthesis of analogs of other nucleoside phosphates in Phase II. The newly synthesized compound will be tested for its effect on certain enzymes and its potential antitumor and antiviral activity. The boronated nucleotides may be useful in a number of ways including 1) as tools for studying mechanism of action of enzymes, 2) as antiviral and antitumor agents, and 3) as carriers of boron-10 for boron neutron capture therapy.",

Direct cytotoxic effects of viral gp120 on neurons, perhaps mediated through inhibition of neurotrophic growth factors, has been demonstrated. The measurement of this viral protein activity has relevance, therefore, to determine the effects of HIV infection on the CNS and pediatric development. Levels of gp120 neurocytoxicity will be determined for plasma and some CSF samples from HIV pediatric patients undergoing clinical trials for neurological end points. Base line samples collected before the initiation of the trial will be tested to determine if it is practical to measure plasma gp120 neurotoxicity levels at different stages of the disease. If so, samples collected at the end of the trial may then be tested to evaluate the ability of the assay system to monitor the efficacy of therapy. Other retroviral markers will be included to determine their comparative usefulness to monitor or predict clinical change. The measurement of biologically active viral gp120 in pediatric patient fluids will be correlated with relevant and specific neurodevelopmental and neurocognitive clinical endpoints in order to determine if viral neurocytotoxic gp120 levels correlate with symptomatology. Enhanced diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment is envisioned.",

This spectroradiometer is incorporated with a Brimrose acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF). An AOTF uses an ultrasonic wave in a crystal to achieve fast and broadband spectral tuning. AOTFs are totally solid state devices with no moving parts, compact (1 cm cubed), light weight, and low power for battery operation. Because of that, the diameter of the submersible portion of the spectroradiometer is only about 5 cm. Since the AOTF can do self-calibration, no periodic maintenance is needed. In addition, the AOTF can be programmed to simultaneously pass multiple wavelengths, implement powerful matched filtering algorithms and the light throughput is independent of the resolution, which can greatly increase the sensitivity. As a side benefit, this spectroradiometer can also measure the polarization ratio of the light at different wavelength simultaneously. The fast tuning speed (10 ohms), high resolution (1-2 nm), high sensitivity, small size and inherent ruggedness of AOTFs make them ideal for los level light measurement under thick sea ice cover.",

The byproduct of the synthesis is hydrogen that can be sold or used on site for fuel cell based electricity production. Thus, two revenue bearing streams, fullerenes and H2 (or electrical power without CO2 emissions) are the product of the proposed process. Approximate cost analysis of the proposed and competing processes were performed and indicated that the plasma based fullerene synthesis could conceivably bring down their production cost to zero because all costs could be covered by the sale of H2 or electricity. In Phase I we propose to begin experimental fullerene yield optimization program (using existing equipment) via parametric variations of three process variables. Alternative fullerene purification process that involves supercritical fluids will also be investigated. The experimental program will be guided by concurrent analysis and the system cost analysis will be refined. Busek Co. will be assisted by SRI International.

The increase in fluid pressure ruptures a diaphragm containment seal allowing the fluid to flow through a boost motor/heat exchanger where the high pressure fluid is heated to high temperature. The heated fluid is used to spin-up rotors and to ignite the burner of the turbojet engine. The thermal energy input to the heat exchanger is from the products of combustion of the solid booster motor.",

        "abstract": "Anticipated computing advances will greatly enhance the Navy's ability to compute submarine target strength. This capability can be an important diagnostic and design tool for T.S. control. While the complexity and size of the scattering problem makes it necessary to solve large sets of structural-acoustic equations, especially at mid-frequencies, it is not sufficient to achieve high fidelity predictions. A number of other outstanding issues must be resolved. One is the lack of mathematical descriptions of the dominant energy dissipation mechanisms associated with hull and internal structure vibrations other than acoustic radiation. Such mechanisms include dry friction or Coulomb damping, viscous damping, e.g., of flexural waves, isolation mounts, and at stress concentration, air damping etc. Regardless of computing power this limits the fidelity of predictions for those T.S. components affected by submarine elasticity; the launching, propagation and scatteing of elastic waves. It is the purpose of the proposed Phase I work to ameliorate this situation by identifying candidate mechanisms, developing mathematical descriptions for their behavior, criteria for required input parameters, and providing solution techniques compatible with conventional structural-acoustic numerical methods.",

The Ti:Sapphire laser is tunable from 790-900 nm and with the addition of a non-limear crystal, the wavelength region will be extended to include 375-450 nm. For added flexibility we also propose to investigate a laser resonator which could alternate colors between two adjacent micropulses. Existing photography equipment allows 80 frames recording at rates of up to 1 MHz. Alternatively, current solid state cameras can be used for imaging and storage rates of up to 12 KHz.

        "abstract": "We will develop a cw holmium laser stereotactic endoscopic neurosurgical treatment of hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus is currently managed by the use of valved shunts to drain cerebrospinal fluid from obstructed ventricles. At present, shunt revision is by far the most common neurosurgical reoperation being performed. Radiation from a 2.1 micron cw holmium laser is fiberoptically compatible, and it has been shown in preliminary experiments to ablate soft tissue, leaving approximately 500 micron zone of thermal damage. Using the holmium laser under stereotactic endoscopic control, it should be possible to perform precise fenestration of ventricular walls. Ventricular fenestration is expected to eliminate the need for an implanted shunt and reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with hydrocephalus. The goal of the proposed work is to demonstrate that stereotactic endoscopic ventricular fenestration can be safely performed using a cw holmium laser. The procedure will also provide a lasting and effective means of managing hydrocephalus caused by ventricular obstructions. In Phase I, the laser-tissue interaction will be studied in detail in animal experiments, and the surgical approach will be tested in human cadaveric studies. Phase II will begin with an evaluation of the procedure in an in vivo porcine model, followed by clinical trials.",

Choroidal neovascularization is the most frequent cause of blindness in patients over the age of 65. The success of current argon/krypton laser treatments is severely limited by patient eligibility criteria, a high recurrence rate, and loss of vision due to the treatment itself. The treatment procedure to be evaluated in this study uses small doses of Indocyanine Green injected prior to each laser burn to selectively enhance absorption of laser light in the designated target area during laser irradiation. In contrast to previous studies, dye concentration is monitored precisely. Laser energy is delivered during the transit of a dye bolus or when the dye concentration reaches its maximum in the target area. A diode laser at 805 nm, matched to the absorption maximum of ICG will be coupled to an infrared video fundus camera delivery system. Optimum parameters for dynamic dye-enhanced laser treatment will be evaluated in a rabbit model in the Phase I study.",

Incorporated within the proposed new device is a pulsatile flow, bladder type pump-reservoir in which is deployed a blood-on-the-outside/gas-on-the-inside hollow fiber membrane oxygenator. The highly efficient, thromboresistant, siloxane gas transfer membrane technology recently developed by the proposing scientists to produce the successful intra-vascular oxygenator (IVOX) will be modified/adapted to be applicable to the proposed new pump oxygenator. The objective of this project is to simplify, miniaturize, integrate, and automate the current extracorporeal cardiopulmonary by- pass perfusion system, thus making it fully portable, more blood compatible, safer, and more effective. If successful, the device could find widespread use in replacing the present cardiopulmonary by-pass systems used in many open-heart surgery cases. This device could also find use in most extracorporeal perfusion systems used for prolonged ECMO, ECLA, ELS, or ECCO2R, emergency life support perfusion systems, or for long term support of patients in cardiorespiratory failure. In the proposed Phase I of this R & D project the proposing scientists will 1) produce and solidify the device design and materials concepts, 2) fabricate prototype devices, and 3) carry out engineering bench tests and ex vivo experimental animal perfusions to assess the performance characteristics and feasibility of the proposed unique new device.

This development would facilitate future progress in developing therapeutic methodology for optimizing cavitation effects within (and hence destruction of) brain tumors, while minimizing heating damage in surrounding normal brain tissue. The specific objective of the (in vitro) Phase I program is to produce lipid-coated microbubbles (LCM) containing \"pure\" oxygen or other selected gases (instead of air). The modified LCM will be stabilized by a surfactant-coating containing an optimal combination of monoglycerides and cholesterol esters \u00bf which can vary depending upon the encapsulated gas. The laboratory test program involves the determination (and comparison) of the average diameter, size distribution, concentration, and especially stability of microbubbles surrounded by the surfactant monolayer. The encapsulated gases to be employed individually are 02 , Ar, N2O, and CO2. The follow-on Phase II studies in animals would assess the likely enhanced cavitational (and direct chemical) effects of these modified LCM. If successful, such findings would allow develop- ment of a treatment modality useful for multiple and/or low-radiosensitivity intracranial tumors in humans.",

There is a desire to find a less invasive and less risky sampling procedure. A number of laboratories are developing procedures to enrich fetal trophoblasts from maternal blood. These procedures are not expected to provide pure populations of fetal cells, so a means of verifying fetal origin for female fetuses is needed. To verify fetal origin, we will develop a statistics-based image analysis of metaphase chromosomes labelled with fluorescent alpha satellite DNA probes. We base our strategy on the number of copies of alpha-satellite DNA repeats is variable in human populations, so an analysis of intensity of the fluorescent \"light stars\" emanating from each chromosome should allow us to distinguish fetal from maternal cells. This procedure uses the same metaphase spreads prepared for standard prenatal cytogenetics, so standard analysis can be carried out on previously stored images of the fetal-verified cells. A simpler version of these procedures will provide a means for uniquely identifying humans for paternity and forensic purposes.",

        "abstract": "We will use a recombinant technique to produce Human Elastase Inhibitor (HEI); therefore, its potential as anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical agent can be evaluated. The known properties of HEI, one of very few naturally occurring human inhibitors of elastase, indicate that it will likely serve as pharmaceutical agent in a variety of inflammatory conditions which excess action of the powerful neutrophil protease elastase causes tissue damage. These include emphysema, cystic fibrosis, asthma, arthritis and several-skin diseases. HEI, which is found in blood monocytes and neutrophils, has been purified (in small amounts) from a human cell line, and its cDNA sequence and several important characteristics of the protein have been determined. The major block to the development of HEI as anti-inflammatory agent is the absence of a supply of the pure protein. In order for additional properties (comparisons, stability, side-effects, etc.) to be examined and its suitability as pharmaceutical agent to be evaluated, pure HEI is needed in sufficient quantities. The project aims to produce recombinant HEI. The available starting materials are a cDNA clone for encoding the full-length molecule and a simple and specific assay that can be used to screen expression systems. The major goal is to make an expression construct, to be generated from the existing full length cDNA clone and a commercial vector, and to express the construct in the baculovirus/insect cell system. Goals of Phase II will include scaling up of the protein expression system and purification of the recombinant protein.",

        "abstract": "All-ceramic bearings offer high temperature capability, longer fatigue lifetimes, and lower weight compared to conventional steel bearings. However, the low fracture toughnes of the ceramic material (typically silicon nitride) restricts the allowable hoop stress, and therefore severly limits their use for potential applications. Reinforcement of the ceramic matrix is a viable means to increase fracture toughness, although reinforcement of the bearing surface may induce fatigue crack initiation, result in differential wear rates and reduce attainment of fine surface finish. Consequently, a ceramic matrix composite (CMC) design with a monolithic bearing surface case and a higher toughness core region fabricated into a bearing race geometry is desirable. In this Phase I effort, techniques to fabricate silicon nitride with selective reinforcement (graded CMC) are conceptualized, demonstrated and evaluated by fabricating materials in selected geometries and thereafter characterized with respect to physical amd mechanical properties. Fabrication techniques to be considered for producing selectively graded reinforced ceramic bearing races include: 1) centrifugal spinning of matrix based slurries containing particulate reinforcement(s), 2) selected high pressure molten metal infiltration to produce graded-tough cermets and 3) incorporation of refractory fibers for selected reinforcement.",

Such a cooling system would deliver fuel to the ramburner in varying amounts of liquid and gaseous phases. This project proposes to experimentally investigate and develop an innovative dual-phase fuel injector prototype suitable for crossflow injection in ramburners. The fuel injector will be selected based on the following criteria: 1. Liquid spray atomization; 2. fuel penetration/distribution for liquid, gaseous, and combined liquid/gaseous fuel injection; 3. susceptibility to plugging/clogging; 4. design complexity. In Phase I, design concepts will be screened at ambient conditions using isothermal bench-scale tests. The liquid-phase fuel will be simulated using water and the gas-phase fuel will be simulated using CO2. The best designs will be isothermally tested in an existing Integral Fuel Injector/Flameholder (IFF) to show their overall feasibility. In Phase II, the best designs from Phase I will be tested in a combustion rig, under ramburner conditions, using endothermic fuels. The Phase II tests will document the performance of the new injectors under realistic conditions. If successfully demonstrated, the prototype will be tested and evaluated in a turboramjet engine demonstrator in Phase III.",

It is retrofitable into existing installations as well as integratable into future APU/SPU engines. CFDRC proposes an experimental/analytical team for CFDRC, Garrett Auxiliary Power Division (GAPD), and the University of Cincinnati (UC). The Phase I program includes: 1. application if GAPD IPS design procedures to assist in focusing CFDRC's proposed base line concept test program at UC; 2. IPS analytical wall contour optimization with and without implementation of EPS technology using advanced CFD analysis; 3. preliminary assessment and specification of scavenge requirements; and 4. documentation of CFD technology utilized to refine the IPS concept proposed here. Application of CFD technology during Phase I is expected to assist in early minimization of first stage compressor rotor excitation sources due to IPS inlet flow distortion. Phase II will consist of IPS prototype detailed design, fabrication, and sand removal efficiency testing. GAPD will assist CFDRC in assessment and implementation of all U.S. Army airworthiness requirements.",

Without full consideration of this guidance, bare base planning may become time-consuming and inconsistent. The development of personal computer based bare base planning model would significantly improve the process of establishing an operational bare base. A computer modeling developed and structured for field development would simplify and expedite bare base planning and would help to minimize the time between conceptualization and operation of a bare base. The research proposed for Phase I work would first identify user requirements to enable program utility and products to become effective tools for field employment. Planning parameters will be established which will define program flexibility and allow analysis and incorporation of site specific factors. Planning modules will be developed which will reflect bare base development priorities both in terms of mission accomplishment and in terms of impact on other planning modules. Planning factors will be identified for each planning module aand interrelationships between each planning module will be delineated and incorporated into software programs in an input/output model format. Specific input requirements for certain planning modules would be structured to be delivered as output data from interrelated planning modules. The final product from Phase I development is expected to be a software program which would produce a narrative listing of facility requirements, concerns, and developmental sequence for a generic bare base layout. The model would be structured in the delineation of planning parameters to reflect varying levels of flexibility to allow mission and planning variances to accommodate site specific characteristics/requirements. Phase II work will work to develop software to translate the narrative requirements and concerns produced by Phase I research into graphic modeling.",

IN CONTRAST, THE SURFACE DETECTORS BEING DEVELOPED ARE SIMPLE, SMALL, RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE, FAST, AND HIGHLY SENSITIVE. PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTS DEMONSTRATED THAT DETECTION LIMITS MAY BE REDUCED UP TO THREE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE. THE RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THE DEPENDENCE OF SENSOR RESPONSE ON DETECTOR TYPES, FILM THICKNESS, NATURE OF SUBSTRATE, TEMPERATURE, AND INTERFERENCES, SO THAT ONE METHOD CAN BE SELECTED FOR MORE COMPLETE CHARACTERIZATION AND PROTOTYPE DEVELOPMENT.

Previous work by ChemGen created a non-feed back inhibited pathway for the efficient synthesis of thymidine from UDP in five steps through the introduction of phage genes. In order to deregulate and improve UDP synthesis, an operon will be constructed with the coding sequences of pyrE, pyrF, and pyrH genes that code for orotate phosphoribosyltransfer- ase, orotidine 5'- phosphate decarboxylase and UMP kinase. This will provide efficient temperature inducible expression of these non-feed back inhibited enzymes. Introduction of the constructed operon into current thymidine production strains will provide deregulated synthesis of thymidine from orotic acid precursor and the basis for a commercial process. Orotic acid can be supplied to fermentations as an inexpensive feed stock for bioconversion into thymidine.",

        "abstract": "Thymidine is a precursor for the manufacture of two anti-AIDS drugs, AZT and d4T. Currently, thymidine is manufactured primarily through a chemical synthesis process. AZT manufacturing cost is very sensitive to thymidine price since the AZT production process is based on a relatively low yield, multiple-step synthesis from thymidine. Reduction on the price of thymidine should greatly reduce the cost of AZT treatment for AIDS patients. A fermentation process for the production of thymidine has been developed. The fermentation process has the potential to greatly reduce the cost of manufacturing thymidine. Two key enzymes from phages have been utilized through gene cloning and expression. The joint expression causes cells to excrete significant amounts of thymidine. The production of either enzyme is lethal to the cells. The genes for both enzymes have been modified so that their expression is tightly regulated and is inducible by a temperature shift. One of the phage genes has been stably integrated into the host chromosome. The research will integrate and stabilize the three genes that code for the second enzyme to achieve a fermentation process with a commercial thymidine titer.",

The focus is on the detection and measurement by means of a specific physical chemical phenomenon--colloidal flocculation--due to the interaction of caries-connected extracellular polysaccharides (ECPs). Specifically produced enzymatically from sucrose by caries-associated mutans streptococci. The test uses salivary samples or a month rinse, and its sensitivity is adjusted to level which corresponds to well-established limits based on generally accepted ranges of viable counts of cultured mutans streptococci. A prototype test will be studied using saliva obtained from geriatric subjects already enrolled in a root caries risk assessment program. Correlations are made between the results of the one-step calorimetric prototype and salivary total viable cultured streptococci species, Streptococci salivarius and mutans streptococci species using standard culturing techniques and colony morphology. The prototype test results will be similarly compared to the measured quantities of total, soluble and insoluble extracellular polysaccharides; thus, the results will incorporate radioactive sucrose by salivary transferase enzymes found in the same samples. Correlation occurring between salivary flors, total, soluble and insoluble ECPs will be established statistically. From these measurements and statistics, the test is validated with respect to its specificity for class of extracellular polysaccharide secreted by caries-risk levels of caries associated microorganisms.",

        "abstract": "Beta thalassemia, the most common disease inherited at a single genetic locus, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in populations having high frequencies of the beta-thalassemia mutations. At this juncture, the mainstays of therapy in afflicted populations consist of population screening, genetic counseling, and prenatal diagnosis. Accurate diagnosis, on which each of these depends, entails detecting at the DNA level beta-thalassemia mutations, which are both numerous and of diverse ethnic distribution. Practical diagnosis of beta-thalassemia mutation in distinct ethnic groups requires both accuracy and a level of simplicity that can be applied outside dedicated research laboratories. We will use the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based Reverse Dot Blot method to develop diagnostic kits for the beta-thalassemia mutations found commonly in Southeast Asian and in African-American populations. The Reverse Dot Blot method is sensitive because it employs PCR to amplify 100,000 to 1,000,000 times the genes to be tested, accurate because it depends on the same Watson- Crick base pairing that insures faithful transmission of genes from one generation to the next, and efficient because it tests amplified gene target sequences for the presence of several mutations in a single hybridization reaction. We will design oligonucleotide probes complementary to the beta-thalassemia mutations segregating in defined populations and to their allelic wild-type sequences, fix these probe pairs to filters, amplify and label target DNA to be tested, and determine if the test DNA contains mutant beta-thalassemia sequences by whether it hybridizes to fixed mutant probes or only to wild type probes. Diagnostic kits designed using this method will be applied to the rapid, accurate diagnosis of beta-thalassemia, which will greatly facilitate screening, counseling, and prenatal diagnosis in popula- tions at risk.",

        "abstract": "The heart of the MLAB modeling language is the facility for parameter estimation in mathematical models by fitting to data. This computation is performed using the Marquardt-Levenburg algorithm and is applicable to nonlinear models subject to linear constraints. By the use of appropriate weighing choices, the algorithm is capable of a variety of extensions. These extensions include norms other than L2, iteratively reweighted least squares, and, for special cases only, maximum likelihood estimation. The robustness of the algorithm has been enhanced through the provision of automatically-calculated symbolic partial derivatives and by heuristic use of gradient search. Despite all these features, there are still many classes of estimation problem that are beyond the current capability of MLAB. These include more general maximum likelihood estimation, stochastic estimation, and estimation for partial differential equation-defined models. For each of these classes, we have developed new strategies and intend to incorporate them into MLAB. The present project deals with three particular aspects of nonlinear estimation that we have identified for enhancement: (1) generalization of the constraint facility to include nonlinear equality and inequality constraints using Lagrange multiplier techniques, (2) generalization of the facility for estimation of the confidence intervals and joint confidence regions for parameters in nonlinear models with active constraints, and (3) provision of alternative methods for function optimization that will increase the robustness of parameter estimation for certain classes of nonlinear models. In particular, simplex methods and simulated annealing have been identified as suitable candidates. For Phase I, we will identify a wide range of further extensions to be developed for Phase II.",

        "abstract": "The MLAB interactive mathematical modeling language is intended to serve biomedical researchers. It has been implemented by Civilized Software for IBM-compatible personal computers. MLAB may be used to perform complex mathematical and statistical calculations including curve fitting to differential equation models by means of simple, direct computational commands. Functions, data, and computational results may be displayed graphically on screen using powerful graphics commands. These graphs may also be converted to a disk file for transmission to a Postscript laser printer for inclusion in a word-processing document; the word-processing inclusion will allow inclusion in scientific articles. MLAB has shown itself essential in health-related research, as demonstrated by its use in hundreds of publications, and continuing interest in its use at the National Institutes of Health, medical research institutions, and pharmaceutical companies. The objective is to convert and enhance the MLAB program to run on the Apple Macintosh II family of computers. While the initial conversion to be carried out for Phase I will be equivalent to the PC program in most ways, the Phase II product will have new features, including animated graphics, and fully incorporate the Macintosh graphical user interface to increase the power and simplify use of the MLAB program. For Phase I we will also design (subject to revision and enhancement during Phase II) some of the extensions to MLAB which take advantage of the Macintosh graphical user interface. These features will include manipulable graphics windows which permit graphs to be edited using the mouse and pull-down menus to change font, size, color, and position of text labels, to re-size and re-window the graphs, and to produce hard copy. Within graphs, curves may be identified with the mouse for the purpose of deletion, extracting information, removing suspicious data as well as changing color, plotting characters, and labels.",

The goals are to store information over time on the level of development of individual children in such areas as height, weight, gross motor skills, and language acquisition. Additional goals are to make available graphical and other tools for screening and comparing individual children, designated groups, and standard population groupings. Milestones should be useful to anyone who uses time-series and cross-sectional data on the development of groups of children or an individual child. This includes pediatricians, child psychiatrists, developmental markers beyond narrow communities of experts. Milestones will make user-friendly software available in the realm of child development. Milestones will enable more rigorous screenings than currently standard. Phase I will be used to survey, winnow, and consolidate existing developmental data, select areas of development for inclusion, decide upon the programming platform and method of approach, and to design an interface for user-friendly software.

With recent progress in the development of microsatellite markers that can be typed using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a large number of high quality markers will soon be available for use in disease gene mapping. A subset of these that will be sufficient to span a chromosome and will be robust for the collection of genotypic data will be selected for the mapping panels. During Phase I, mapping panels for human chromosomes 10 and 20, consisting of 17-25 and 10-15 markers, respectively, will be developed. Markers with heterozygosities = 0.70 will be selected at 10-15 cM intervals based on their reliability and efficiency of use, following a thorough PCR evaluation.

In addition, we plan to complete several enhancements. l) We will employ a conservative assembly protocol which makes errors only in extreme cases and with low probability. The protocol has been designed with the capability to handle complex repetitive DNA, sequencing errors and chimeric fragments. 2) We will allow the user to include further biological information to aid the assembly. This includes constraints that the two sequenced ends of a plasmid insert be separated by the length of the plasmid insert. 3) Although we anticipated that the discriminatory power of our algorithm will yield the unique, correct algorithm in most cases, we will enumer- ate all possibilities for the assembled sequence when faced with ambiguity caused by repeats. 4) The algorithm will design simple restriction digests where the correct assembly can be verified, or if there are multiple sequences, determine the correct one.

The EMCL actuator is designed for use as the active suspension element of a combat vehicle. The EMCL actuator is particularly suited to this adaptive architecture because the actuator is completely linear over its long travel, and has excellent frequency response, force and travel characteristics. The EMCL actuator is a hybrid brush-fed synchronous DC linear motor consisting of a helical conductor making up the bore of the cylinder and the mechanical supportof the cylinder provided by an iron/fiberglass composite shell. The actuator will mount to a support frame in a manner similar to a conventional hydraulic actuator or snubber. The piston of the actuator consists of permanent magnet/back iron modules that provide thrust for actuation. The movement of the EMCL piston causes the actuator to distend or compress depending opon vehicle requirements. A set of bore guides is used to stabilize the piston in the bore while the bore guides also serve as an electrical conduit providing power to the piston and bore conductor. The basic design of the EMCL actuator is very similar to the electromagnetic actuator used for a torpedo countermeasures launcher that was designed, fabricated and successfuly tested under a DARPA funded launcher effort. The proposed SBIR phase I work includes design, fabrication and testing for a compleyte EASE system which includes a computer controlled adaptive feedback network, electromagnetic coaxial linear actuator, power supply and power conditionong.",

Phase I will evaluate the degradation rate of an improved version of the template in rabbit stifles and test the template in a dog model. Phase II will concentrate on larger numbers of animals for statistical analysis of a direct comparison between the collagen meniscus template and conventional meniscal resection. Specific Aim I will focus on the optimization, production, and quality control testing of the improved collagen meniscus template. Specific Aim II will also measure the template's degradation rate in the rabbit stifle. Specific Aim III will evaluate the performance of the template in the canine stifle. Using anatomic, biochemical and physico-chemical techniques, we will quantify and directly compare current standard meniscal resection alone to the new collagen meniscus template. Accumulated experimental and clinical data have demonstrated that the abnormal force distribution on the tibial plateau post meniscectomy has led to early degenerative arthritis. No accepted treatment, except excision for the irreparably damaged meniscus, exists necessitating technological innovation in the practice of clinical orthopaedics for meniscus repair.",

The project team expects to find that predictive patterns exist within databases of short-term in vitro tests, subchronic tests, and carcinogenicity test. The team also hopes to find that a neural network can be developed using these relationships and patterns to predict a chemical's potential toxicity and carcinogenicity without the need for specific, long-term organ toxicity studies. The resulting product would benefit both government and the private sector by reducing the time and cost of testing and the dependence on animal testing. The methodology used will begin with identification of available data sources and selection of those to be used in the study. The data will be acquired and prepared for use by data discovery software that finds previously unknown patterns, relationships and correlations in the data contained in the database. These findings will then be used to assist in designing and training of a neural network for toxicological prediction. The neural network will be tested and its predictive performance evaluated and reported.",

        "abstract": "Efficient and cost effective ocean outfall dilution systems are essential to the health of the ocean enviroment. Unfortunately, wasterfield transport and subsequent ocean outfall dilution are complex functions of the local ocean stratification and currents and the outfall and diffuser locations and design. Variables such as effluent discharge riser spacing, diameter and jet efflux velocity determine the depth of submergence, wastefield thickness and dilution. Detailed field measurements of outfall performance are few and there is insufficient data with which to assess the performance of existing mathematical prediction models. Turbulence models which attempt to predict multiport riser mixing must include the influence of velocity-concentration cross-correlations. Unfortunately, little or no information is available on the form or magnitude of these cross-correlations. Extensive measurements are required to help to establish a waste water mixing data base which could be used both as a mixing modeling guide and for design purposes. Detailed, non-intrusive optical measurements of riser turbulent mixing characteristics will provide new information on riser mixing effectiveness and the effects of changes in ocean current magnitude and direction. These measurements will be made with a new optical probe which will be designed and tested in a simple water tank during Phase I.",

We have designed a set of vigilance experiments from which to obtain the appropriate ERP data base. Existing data will be processed using present techniques and the quantitative measures so obtained will be compared with those resulting from the proposed modifications of those methods.

This proposal describes a robotic system which automatically positions and maneuvers a laparoscope for the surgeon. A novel human interface based on image processing and voice recognition techniques lets the surgeon control the laparoscope in a very natural and convenient manner, while delivering high precision control in a fast response time. Adding this capability to the operating room will decrease cost, reduce human resource requirements, and lower the risk to the patient. We have developed a foot controlled laparoscope positioning robot, AESOP, for Automated Endoscope System for Optimal Positioning. This phase l effort will allow us to build upon AESOP by testing a new human-interface idea which would significantly improve its usability and acceptance.",

Existing algorithms, as well as proposed theoretical and practical extensions will be investigated.

These responses are important in flight and play an important role in spatial disorientation and the generation of various illusions of motion. The two responses are also important medically. Optokinectic responses are useful in the detection of central nervous system disorders and vestibular nystagmus induced by whole body rotation or caloric stimulation is used to evaluate the vestibul-ocular reflex.

The first involves signal processing, avenues for improving the filtering of this data by current OS (order statistic) techniques will be explored and other techniques for filtering will be explored (wavelets, morphology, fuzzy logic, and neural networks). Second, the development of a nonlinear system theory for application to biological signals like the nystagmus will be investigated, a first step in this direction will be outlined below (section d).

More rapid brain scanning with higher resolution is one expected medical benefit of this project. Another is the sensitive mapping of chemical species other than hydrogen. High-temperature superconducting thin films will be used to obtain the extremely low probe-coil resistances necessary for the low-noise performance. Small probes with localized sensitivity patterns will be used to limit tissue loading effects which degrade the noise performance. The Phase I tasks include: (1) determination of the limitations of present MRI and MRS systems in the study of cerebral function; (2) establishment of performance goals for probes to be made in Phase II; and (3) generation and evaluation of strawman probe designs and prototype devices. In Phase II, probe assemblies, complete with preamps and cryogenic enclosures, will be manufactured and tested.",

This project seeks to overcome the limitations of current in vitro systems by employing a novel culture strategy to measure neurotoxicity. Nitrocellulose membranes are used as the culture substratum and to separate feeder cells, which in turn provide metabolic support for neurons and glia and establish cell/cell interactions needed for drug activity. The specific aims are to 1) prepare neuronal and glial cultures from different regions of the nervous system, 2) compare cell growth using different culture techniques, 3) establish assays to measure cell survival after proliferation, and 4) compare the effects of chemicals and drugs on nerve cultures. Commercialization of this research meets demands in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries for in vitro alternatives to testing in whole animals. Most chemicals in commercial use have not been evaluated for neurotoxicity, and many drugs have the potential for causing neurodegenerative and demyelinating diseases.",

This method has been demonstrated to yield continuous, high strength fibers of materials such as boron, silicon, and others, with diameters in the range 10-30 microns, tensile strengths up to 7 GPa (10 6 psi), and high modulus. Preliminary experiments have demonstrated silicon nitride fiber growth but further research is required to determine conditions for making the fibers with superior properties. The LCVD process grows fibers by deposition at the hot spot created by a focussed laser beam. It can yield fibers with extremely uniform properties, e.g., +/- 5% in tensile strength, which result in part from an unique control mechanism. The fiber automatically grows to a position near the laser focal point where the growth rate equals the fiber pulling rate, maintaining a reproducible and constant fiber growth temperature if the fiber pulling rate is kept constant. The same mechanism supports economical design and operation of fiber production reactors. LCVD growth of continuous, small diameter (10-40 microns), high stength ( > 7 GPa = 10 6 psi tensile strength), stoichiometric and/or chemical composition-controlled silicon nitride fibers will be developed and optimized.",

CSL, Inc. will use a four phase approach with the objectives being correlation, redesign, multiple board analysis, and evaluation of component plating processes. By optimizing the technology through these four phases, we will be able to maximize the system areas of application as a process control tool. Using industry partners and an analytical laboratory approach, we can then maximize the exposure to the industry through a multidimensional test matrix. Understanding the type and level of oxides present throughout the metallization processes will lead to improved product quality. To give todays manufacturers cost affective process control tools that will improve product reliability can only save our industry uncountable millions od dollars and allow these manufacturers to better compete in the world market.

        "abstract": "Peripheral neuropathy is a common and clinically significant complication of cancer chemotherapy. Importantly, this neuropathy is a dose-limiting effect of many chemotherapeutic agents. Since the clinical outcome is often dependent on the tolerated dose, a drug which reduces the neuropathy would increase the tolerated dose and thus increase survival as well as improve quality of life. Observations of both animal and human effects of chemo- therapeutic agents suggest that inappropriate triggering of a latent program for cell death in peripheral neurons contributes to the pathology. Recent research indicates that this program involves the active production of specific killer proteins rather than being a passive process. This provides the opportunity to interfere with the process by inhibition of the killer function. Programmed cell death can be modeled in vitro and in these same primary neuronal models chemotherapeutic agents are selectively toxic.

        "abstract": "The objective is to develop a practical method for measurement of cochlear morphometric and physiological responses from fluorescent microscope images of cochlear tissue. Fluorescent molecular probes are chosen for the particular purpose of the experiments, i. e., marking the location and distribution of actin structural proteins in the organ of Corti. The method quantifies the spatial three dimensional extent of the fluorescent intensity from living or fixed specimens of the organ of Corti, or isolated cochlear hair cells. This is accomplished by focusing a microscope to obtain a series of images which are then operated upon by a unique computational procedure giving restored quantitative images for further analysis. The novelty of the measurement system is the incorporation of prior knowledge about the nature of the cochlear images. The Phase I objective is to implement the method as a convenient procedure and analyze the F-actin distribution in an in vitro preparation of the organ of Corti. Phase I has three specific aims: 1) automate the image acquisition and analysis procedure, and further develop the computational algorithm; 2) study the image distortion introduced by measurements from the organ of Corti; and 3) Map the spatial distribution of actin in the supporting cells in the organ of Corti.",

The use of Ultra Wide Band radar for this purpose shows significant promise. Development of a practical radar depends on the development of new techniques of design for antennas, receivers and microwave power generating equipment. This proposal describes a new and novel antenna which combines the features of a broadband antenna and a microwave power generator. New approaches to receiver design for this class of system are also addressed, and a performance estimate is planned to validate the design approach.",

The Li/LiX Co O2 cell has been identified as a promising redox couple for this particular application. A formidable stumbling block to the advancement of this technology resides in the inability of non-aqueous electrolytes -to enable the anode to be charged without Li dendrite formation -to withstand the highly anodic potentials required by the cathode on charge In order to circumvent these problems, we have identified two new turbostratic mesocarbons which will be substituted for the Li anode during Phase I. In addition, we will test two new high rate electrolytes which should provide both a high anodic window with good low temperature performance. The combination of a mesocarbon anode with high rate electrolytes is expected to advance rechargable LiX C6/LiX Co O2 battery technology, specifically for U.S. Navy application.",

The intimal endothelial cells appear to be the focus of this immune response, which results in loss of the intimal lining of the vessel lumen during the first two weeks after transplantation and the longer-term risk of occlusion. This proposal will examine the hypothesis that ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation may reduce the immunostimulatory capabilities of allogeneic canine saphenous veins, while preserving cell viability. Initial in vitro experiments will determine whether UVB irradiation of endothelial cells can induce immunological tolerance in mixed cultures of irradiated endothelial cells and non-irradiated allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In situ experiments will then be performed, using UVB doses defined in vitro, to select a dose with maximal in vitro effect and minimal in situ losses of cell viability. An in vivo transplantation study will then be performed to determine the effects of this selected UVB irradiation dose on endothelial cell survival and allograft patency. If the results of this feasibility study are positive, human saphenous veins will be studied in the next, Phase II, grant application. Reduction of the immunological consequences of venous allografting would justify the use of allograft veins in a broad range of clinical applications.",

The understanding of these materials is limited and they have not been utilized in practical applications. Typical candidate materials are doped crystals with magnetic spins on dopant ion and non-magnetic host crystal ions. In addition to these properties it is important to grow the chosen material in single crystal form in large enough sizes for devices. Based upon the available information, two materials have been selected, viz., Eu:Y2Si05 and Eu:YAG. During the proposed Phase I program the crystal growth characteristics of the materials will be identified and potential use evaluated. Eu:Y2Si05 has exhibited dephasing time (822 us) whereas Eu:YAG is chosen, in spite of A1 ions in the host, because it is a well-understood host crystal.

In the proposed work we will examine CVD diamond doped with transition metals and rare earths for inhomogeneously broadened absorption lines that may be placed conveniently to the tuning range of diode lasers.

However, this drug has not gained wide acceptance world wide because of its great potential of causing calcium toxicity including hypercalciuria, hypercalcemia, kidney stones and soft tissue calcification. 1,25(OH)2D3 is the biologically active form of vitamin D and when given orally has a direct action on the small intestine by increasing the efficiency of calcium absorption. 1,25(OH)2D3 has also been demonstrated to be extremely effective both orally and topically for the treatment of psoriasis. However, since 1,25(OH)2D3 is a lipid soluble compound, its topical formulation is difficult and often requires an ointment based preparation. Greasy ointment preparations are less acceptable to patients than cream based ones. 1,25(OH)2D,3, when given orally, interacts directly with the small intestine to raise the efficiency of calcium absorption. A form of 1,25(OH)2D3, that is in a prodrug form, is needed, so when it is taken orally it does not have a first pass biologic effect on the intestine. In addition, if the prodrug form of 1,25(OH)2D3 had increased water solubility, it could be formulated in a cream for the treatment of psoriasis. The goal of Phase I is to chemically synthesize two glycoside derivatives of 1,25(OH)2D3 including 1,25(OH)2D3 -3beta-glucoside, and 1,25(OH)2D3-m- altoside. Once these compounds have been synthesized, their water solubility will be investigated along with their biologic activity in vitro.",

        "abstract": "Visual interpretation of the x-ray coronary arteriogram is today the gold standard for defining the pathoanatomy in coronary heart disease. However, there are inherent limitations in this method of interpretation. In particular, arterial flow rates are needed to estimate the degree of regional insufficiency of blood supply. Despite the arteriogram's central role it permits only indirect and crude estimates of flow rates. Efforts to use the 'time-of-flight' method to estimate x-ray dye flow rates have not been successful clinically. The procedure is complex and has been limited to the less informative projective images. This proposal is to implement a direct automated measurement technique to evaluate regional muscle perfusion in 3-D. The new technique utilizes the x-ray projection angiographic data. However, rather than reconstructing in 3-D the initial phase of the injection of the contrast dye, the late portion of the injection is reconstructed. This late phase exhibits large pulsatile levels of contrast dye in the sponge-like muscle. From the pulsatile rates of clearance and re-supply of the dye and the magnitude of these pulses, relative flow rates and muscular contractility are computed in 3-D. These important cardiac parameters have been elusive so far. Their measurement constitutes an important innovation for the goal of this effort to improve the choice of therapy in coronary heart disease and immediate decision while doing PTCA.",

The testing units will be based on programmable microcontroller technology and will measure vigilance attention and reaction time performance. Impairment in these areas of function is likely to be the major reason for the increased risk of accidents from alcohol misuse and abuse in the workplace. Being able to efficiently detect such impairments has the potential to produce significant savings for society in economic and human costs. The economic costs have been estimated as high as $80 billion per year in the United States, so even a small reduction in accident rate would be worthwhile. The project will take existing software and hardware components, currently operating on standard personal computers, and integrate these into a small, self-contained, portable testing unit. Task learning and convergence to baseline performance, day to day test-retest stability, and performance effects of ethanol will be studied in normal subjects, and a best possible multivariable discriminant function model will be developed to use as the testing system assessment algorithm. The key concept is comparison of individuals to their own baseline performance patterns in order to maximize accuracy of assessment. The assessment of individuals requires 2-3 minutes, provides immediate feedback, and is generally not considered an invasion of privacy, in contrast to urine testing, which is problematic in several respects.",

Rapid reliable nerve anastomosis has numerous applications. In cancer therapy, removal of tumors in head and neck region frequently requires subsequent repair of the facial nerve. In reconstructive surgery of the hand after trauma, multiple microanastomoses are needed. In oral surgery, removal of lower wisdom teeth can result in nerve injury requiring microsurgery to repair damaged peripheral nerves. The prototype nerve anastomosis system will use feedback control to obtain more consistent welds than are possible with manual control. The prototype system will be mounted on an operating microscope and will use a micromanipulator to deliver focused light to the nerve. Feedback control will be based on using the backscattered light from the irradiated tissue to determine when collagen denaturation has occurred. Studies of the polarization, angular distribution, and relative change in specular and diffuse backscatter will be conducted to determine the optimum control technique. An acute study using the rat sciatic nerve will be used to determine the optimum tissue welding parameters. A chronic study using a rabbit model will then compare conventional and laser anastomoses as evaluated by electrophysiological and quantitative histomorphometric assays.",

        "abstract": "Petroleum products from fueling and maintenance facilities are common pollutants in surface and groundwater. Most oil/water separators currently in use are coalescing plate interceptor (CPI) units made up of closely-spaced plastic plates submerged in the waste stream. Microscopic oil droplets coalesce on the surfaces of the plates, then collect and rise to the water surface in the plate chamber. The system works effectively but maintenance is expensive because the fragile plate-and-spacer assemblies must be removed for cleaning and are susceptible to damage. This proposal is to study the possibility of using low-coat glass marbles as a coalescing medium in place of plastic plates. Glass attracts oil as well as plastic does, and the interstices between the marbles will allow water to flow through. Oil will coalesce on the surface of the marbles and rise to the water surface for removal. The marbles may be cleaned of sediment by agitating the filter bed with a water or air hose and pumping off the sediment in suspension. The marbles need not be removed and may be re-used indefinitely, saving considerably on the cost of maintenance.",

Two of the concepts use innovative staring spectrometer designs and collect the spatial/ spectral image in a single frame. The other three scanning approaches create the spatial/spectral image by combining multiple image frames. The five methods vary greatly in innovation, performance, and technical risk. The research has four objectives: (A) Identify the IRSIR applications and design goals (B) Perform a preliminary analysis of the five concepts (C) Select the best candidate approach (D) Determine the feasibility of the candidate approach. A design concept will be developed for the best candidate for Phase II prototyping.

We propose to select and to integrate a group of reliability and performance analysis tools, specifically designed to handle the fault-tolerant operational aspects of the next generation avionics architectures. These tools will support both hardware and software evaluation and will be developed in the Ada programming language. The reliability analysis will use a customized CARMS program (computer-aided rate modelling and simulation), with an interactive graphical and spreadsheet interface. The performance analysis tools will use Petri net analysis and Monte Carlo simulation methods. An embedded Ada expert system will help to guide the proper method selection and to control the evaluation and sensitivity analyses. Personal computers will be used for the initial prototyping and simulation. We expect that the availability of these tools will permit earlier evaluation of the effectiveness of the selected architecture, and thus avoid the need for later changes in the design. Our earlier experience with the PAVE PILLAR avionics architecture, embedded expert system design, and fault-tolerant system analysis and simulation methods will provide a sound foundation for this project.",

        "abstract": "Angiogenesis is a tightly regulated process which plays a role in normal physiological events such as wound healing. Angiogenesis is involved in pathological diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and is a key event in the growth and development of solid tumors. There are currently no effective treatments for the aberrant angiogenesis associated with these pathological diseases. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an endothelial cell-specific mitogen, has been isolated and shown to be expressed in a variety of tumor cell lines. Recently, researchers have discovered that VEGF is expressed in specific malignant cells in glioblastoma multiform in vivo , providing further evidence for the role of VEGF in tumorigenesis. The goal is the inhibition of angiogenesis using antisense technology to modulate the expression of VEGF. Specifically, we will use chemically modified antisense oligomers (e. g., phosphorothioate) to inhibit VEGF expression in murine and human cell lines known to express VEGF. Inhibition of VEGF expression will be determined by analysis of protein secretion and mRNA levels as well as by a functional in vivo bioactivity assay. The specificity of VEGF for endothelial cells makes down regulation of this molecule an attractive target for the inhibition of angiogenesis in pathological processes. This research allows for the development of novel treatments to slow the unregulated angiogenesis associated with tumor growth and other diseases.",

The Bauschinger effect is fundamental to the proper simulation and design of ballistic weapons and defenses, space structures, and many other critical metal allow structures subject ot impacts. The proposed work will demonstrate the feasibility of implementing a new model of the Bauschinger effect. The new viscoplastic constitutive model will be based on well established internal variable representations of nonlinear kinematic hardening which properly account for the rate and temperature dependence, large straing kinematics, and suitable corotational stress rate. The model will be implemented using an existing Lagrangian finite element package, and will be verified by comparing simulation predictions with experimental results for several common experimental configurations.",

Graphical interfaces have become the rule, yet quantum chemistry visualization lags far behind other modeling even though quantum calculations account for almost half of the cpu cycles used. In order to address this need, DASGroup will develop a hardware independent graphical user interface based on Application Visualization System (AVS) for the analysis of quantum mechanical calculations of molecular properties. This GUI will be capable of property calculations, visualization, real time manipulation, and animation of results produced by the Gaussian and MOPAC series of programs. DASGroup will compile a computer searchable calculable properties data base for Gaussian and MOPAC, prepare a feasibility study and timetable for converting MOPAC completely into AVS for real time control and visualization of semiempirical calculations, and will demonstrate the visualization and animation of between 1 and 5 calculated molecular properties. DASGroup's ultimate goal is to design and implement MOPAC-AVS, an interactive real time visualization version of MOPAC, and a fully functional molecular modeling graphical user interface for Gaussian, MOPAC, and other quantum codes.",

The resulting coating would disable perisccopes, vision blocks, windshields, headlamps, lasers, and night vision devices as well as destroy vehicle camouflage. The electrically conductive nature of the paint would serve to ground out communications antennae and disrupt or incapacitate radar/dishes. Tanks and armored vehicles with paint-coated optical surfaces would be hazardous to occupy and their weapon systems would be difficult to employ. Adrosol munitions could be tailored to fit existing mines, mortar rounds, artillery shells, UAV's or missile warheads, thus making them an inexpensive addition to existing inventories.

Essential features of the electron-beam fluorescence technique to be used in the evaluation include: beam propagation charcteristics, spatial resolution, simulation of fluorescence spectra and signal level, and minimum measurement time requirements to maintain an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio. Recommendations will be provided on the design characteristics of an appropriate electron-beam fluorescence imaging system and associated image processing schemes to obtain quantitative flow field measurement of gas density and temperature in a hypersonic flow.",

It is now possible, technically, to produce doubled diode laser based sources, but the cost of the nonlinear crystal prevents serious commercial interest. We have developed a new technology which allows the size of the crystal to be substantially reduced, lowering the cost of the system.

        "abstract": "This research is aimed at producing a dependable system design prototype. It will serve as a testbed for research on the integration of dependability automation suport into the systems design process by assisting designers in quantifying tradeoffs between dependability and other system attributes. Phase I consists of three tasks. In Task 1, we will identify the important factors in systems design that lead to tradeoffs among attributes. This will involve: Identifying system design features, specifying dependability, performance, and other system attributes, and identifying the relationships between design features and system attributes. In Task 2, we will develop a methodology for quantifying tradeoffs. This will most likely be based on the principles of multiattribute utility analysis, but may include features from other methods as well (such as the analytic hierarchy process, fuzzy decision analysis, or imprecisely defined multiattribute utility analysis). In Task 3, we will specify the requirements and design of a prototype system to implement the methodoloy. We will also prototype any critical risk areas of the design. The dependable systems design prototype will be fully developed and demonstrated in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Adolescents make health, lifestyle and other decisions which can affect them and others over their entire lives. Research has found them often to be seriously misguided. A method exists to counter decision making deficiencies-personalized decision analysis (PDA)-but its acceptance outside a circle of technical experts has been limited due to requirements for dealing with numbers. We have been developing physical analog devices that use the logic of PDA without requiring the use of numbers, using instead a concrete, manipulative spatial representation. An earlier test of one such device, a balance beam that models certain decision problems, found that students preferred the analog device to a calculator for decision analysis training, and that students so trained performed better in a later test of intuitive ability to apply decision-analytic principles. Phase I will continue developing and testing the balance beam and develop at least one other device. The PIs, a decision analysis educator and an experimental psychologist, will be supported by a middle school teacher, a developmental psychologist and a minorities specialist.

Therefore, accept missile simulation/telemetry data and reconstruct an animation of the events that occurred during the flight/engagement. In order to do this, DRT will define a generic set of simulation outputs which will cover the full range of anticipated flight characteristics. A file format will be defined allowing for maximum flexibility and ease of interface with available data. Data processing modules will be developed to accept trajectory data and reconstruct the flight of the missile using two- and three-dimensional time based animation. The user would interactively choose view angles, field of view and speed of replay (real-time, fast-motion, slow-motion). Depending on the missile flight characteristics of interest including accelerations, angles of attach, fin movements, multistage separation events, etc. Utilizing DRT's Sensor Performance Visualization software, sensor fields of view will be reconstructed. Data processing modules will be written so that they can be used as the building blocks during Phase II development of the fully operational simulation modeling tool. An initial user interface will be developed to allow visualization of data processing module output. Based on this simple interface, plans will be developed and refined for an optimal windowed interface to be developed in Phase II. DRT plans to utilize output data from its in-house 6DOF simulation package as well as simulation and telemetry data provided by DARPA. All software development will be undertaken using C/C++ to allow for maximum compatiblity with the computer world, and portability to Microsoft Windows and Windows NT. Development will emphasize creating a package which can run on a variety of computing platforms including 486 PCs for maximum usefulness. ANCITICPATED BENEFITS: The successful development of the DRT missile simulation post-processing tool will enable users in the government and private sectors to review missile flight data in a manner which is not currently widely possible.

        "abstract": "DRT proposes to develop a novel no-moving-parts pump that delivers flow of oxygen-enriched air, on the order of liters per minute at any desired pressure, without any pulsations or flow noise. A pump operating off a vehicular battery could weigh less than 8 lb. with a size of less than 1 cubic foot. It is based on a demonstrated chemical and biological agent purifying oxygen pumping system, where, in the electrolytic process, a partial pressure of oxygen is developed due to ion flow across a solid electrolyte (yttrium-doped zirconia) in the presence of an electric potential. This pump promises to be the low noise power supply to use with ultrahigh dynamic range, high sensitivity acousto-fluidic devices and other (e.g. inertial) sensors. It will deliver quiet flow on par with, or better than that of bottled compressed air. Cost could be very low due to its simplicity. DRT will test existing oxygen pump hardware and establish overall performance characteristics and will then develop a preliminary design for implementation in a Phase II effort. Also, DRT proposes to identify and assess other fluid power sources in order to provide the Government with a basis for establishing tradeoffs for manportable verses vehicular verses other applications. A survey of power supplies to include other electrolytic processes, chemical and thermal, would be conducted. Characteristics considered will include pnrumatic power required by typical fluidic systems, allowable noise levels, system robustness, source input power requirements (efficiency) and cost.",

In Phase I, substituted (P-BF2) complexes will be prepared, characterized and evaluated for PDT potentials. Studies have documented that human ovarian cancer cells (LS-2) cultured with the disodium salt of pentamethylpyrromethene-2, 6-disulfonate boron difluoride (PMPDS-BF2) plus exposure to light produced cell growth inhibition. In addition, when PMPDS-BF2 was injected intratumor into the DMBA-rat breast cancer model, followed by exposure to quartz lamp irradiation, 50-100% tumor remissions occurred. Cyano, bistetramethylene and acetoxymethyl substituted P-BF2 complexes will be evaluated in vitro and in vivo in mouse and rat tumor models. The P-BF complexes are considered to be quasiaromatic electron impoverished (QA-eI) heterocycles. They show high extinction coefficients, high fluorescent quantum yields; those with superior laser action poses little to no triplet-triplet absorption in the fluorescence spectral region.

Wavelet representation provides a unified framework for techniques including image features analysis, image compression and reconition. Wavelet bases are more attractive than traditional hierarchical bases because they are orthonormal, linear, continuous, and continuously invertible. Choosing wavelets that are simultaneously localized in both space and frequency, and decomposing a signal into a multiscale hierarchical basis with orientation selectivity, can provide a powerful methodology for automated analysis. Neural network will be used in pattern classification for the wavelet representations. The research of this proposal, which takes advantage of the latest image analysis and recognition methods, wavelet transform and neural network, shall lay a solid foundation for the development of an image analysis workstation for oceanographic satellite imagery. The first objective of our investigation is to identify those methods of wavelet representation that perform best in terms of interpretation and automated analysis. The second objective is to develop an image analysis workstation which integrates the most effective image interpretation methods and most advanced image processors for the oceanographic satellite imagery analysis.",

        "abstract": "CANCER IS THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN THE U.S. IN MANY CASES, EARLY AND COMPLETE DETECTION IS CRUCIAL TO A POSTIVE PROGNOSIS. THIS OFTEN REQUIRES DETECTION AT A STAGE WHEN A TUMOR IS TOO SMALL OR TOO POORLY DIFFERENTIATED FROM NORMAL TISSUE TO BE DETECTED BY CONVENTIONAL ANATOMIC IMAGING. CELL SURFACE RECEPTORS FOR THE GROWTH HORMONE RELEASE-INHIBITOR SOMATOSTATIN (SRIF) ARE HYPER-EXPRESSED BY A NUMBER OF CANCERS. (123)I-[TYROSINE(3)]-OCTREOTIDE AND (111)IN-[DTPA] (DIETHYLENETRIAMINEPENTAACETIC) OCTREOTIDE ARE RADIOLABELED SMALL PEPTIDE ANALOGUES OF SRIF THAT BIND WITH HIGH AFFINITY TO SRIF RECEPTORS AND HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EXTREMELY USEFUL IN DETECTING CERTAIN CANCERS INCLUDING SMALL CELL LUNG CARCINOMA, PANCREATIC CARCINOMA, LYMPHOMA, AND SOME BREAST CANCERS. HOWEVER TECHNETIUM ((99M)TC) IS THE PREFERRED NUCLEAR MEDICINE ISOTOPE BECAUSE IT YIELDS GREATER PHOTON FLUX PER UNIT OF RADIATION DOSE DELIVERED TO THE PATIENT, HAS A CONVENIENT 6 HOUR HALF-LIFE, IS RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE, AND IS AVAILABLE 24 HOURS A DAY FROM AN IN-HOUSE GENERATOR. THEREFORE A (99M)TC-LABELED SMALL, SYNTHETIC SOMATOSTATIN-RECEPTOR BINDING PEPTIDE SHOULD COMBINE THE DOCUMENTED DIAGNOSTIC EFFICACY OF THE (123)I AND (111)IN AGENTS WITH THE SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES OF (99M)TC AS THE RADIONUCLIDE. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A NUCLEAR MEDICINE IMAGING AGENT THAT IS A (99M)TC-LABELED SMALL, SYNTHETIC SRIF-RECEPTOR BINDING PEPTIDE FOR IMAGING SRIF-RECEPTOR EXPRESSING TUMORS. TO MEET THESE OBJECTIVES, IT IS PLANNED TO PREPARE AND ASSAY INVITRO APPROXIMATELY 20 PEPTIDE-CHELATOR CONJUGATES AND THEIR RHENIUM COMPLEXES. FURTHERMORE, (99M)TC COMPLEXES WILL ALSO BE PREPARED AND TESTED IN ANIMALS BEARING SSTR-EXPRESSING TUMORS.",

MOST COMMERCIAL VISION SYSTEMS ARE BASED ON VIDEO TECHNOLOGY WITH SEPARATE CAMERAS, FRAME GRABBERS, DIGITIZERS, AND PROCESSORS. RELIANCE ON VIDEO TECHNOLOGY LIMITS PERFORMANCE AND REQUIRES EXPENSIVE, COMPLEX ARCHITECTURES. THE MAXIMUM VIDEO FRAME RATE IS 30 PER SECOND AND THE AVERAGE COMPLETE SYSTEM COSTS OVER $20,000. IN 1991, DICKERSON VISION TECHNOLOGIS, INC, INTRODUCED THE FIRST COMMERCIAL INTEGRATED VISION SYSTEM. THE NEW GRAY SCALE VISION TECHNOLOGY IS SIMPLE, COMPACT, AND INEXPENSIVE (PRICED UNDER $2,000). THIS TECHNOLOGY PACKAGES THE FUNCTIONALITY OF COMMERCIAL GRAY SCALE VISION SYSTEMS INTO ONE DEVICE, THE SIZE OF A BOOK, AND WEIGHING LESS THAN TWO POUNDS. THE IMPROVEMENTS OFFERED BY THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY ARE CHANGING THE MARKET FOR VISION AS MANY MORE APPLICATIONS HAVE BECOME ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE. THE PROJECT ADDRESSES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COLOR INTEGRATED VISION SYSTEM.

Incorporation of high pressure H2 storage into the power system is felt to simultaneously simplify the system while reducing the size/weight of the fuel cell and boosting system efficiency. An air compression system operated by the expansion of high pressure gases will be conceptually designed to allow \"supercharging\" of the fuel cell stack.

This class has several advantages over other classes of materials such as crystals or poled photochromic polymers. FLCs readily form low-light-loss polar films of any thickness; no poling is necessary; the FLC nonlinear susceptibility is intrinsically thermodynamically stable; and FLC optical nonlinearity can be engineered by chemical synthesis or mixing. X(2) FLC films formed into low-light-loss waveguides can be used in devices such as low half-wave electro-optic modulators, frequency doublers, and high-gain optical parametric amplifiers. During Phase I, we will blend new mixtures from x(2)-enhanced liquid crystal monomers synthesized at Displaytech and the University of Colorado and measure their frequency doubling coefficient deff of X-1.06um light at Lawrence Livermore National Lab or their electro-optic modulation coefficient r. Anticipated values for deff exceed 2pm/V, while anticipated values for r exceed 20 pm/V. To reduce temperature sensitivity, light loss, dielectric loss, and possible drive field dependence of x(2)-FLCs, we will also investigate x(2)-FLC polymeric and dipolar glass systems. In Phase II, optimized x(2) FLCs will be synthesized, characterized, and incorporated into first generation waveguide devices such as electrooptic modulators and near infrared diode laser frequency doublers.",

This device is called HOLODAR and achieves its superior performance through the use of multiplex holographic optical spatial filters. We are now proposing a smart passive scintillometer to meet the TECOM need for a high performance passive scintillometer for measuring wind parameters. This device will achieve high performance through the use of fractal theory, wavelet theory, neural networks, extensive scene and image design and test databases. This effort will also use an enhanced version of the theory of passive wind sensing found in the \"Theoretical Analysis and Experimental Evaluation of a Prototype Passive Sensor to Measure Crosswinds\", by Clifford, Ochs and Wang dated September 1974. The key to a successful design and fabrication of an outstanding passive scinillometer is the formulation of an effective way to process and exploit the varying uncertainties and complexities in the naturally illuminated scenes. The large database of images and naturally illuminated scenes will form the starting point of the required analysis. It is anticipated that a smart sensor will provide best performance in a wide variation of scene dynamics.",

The process has been demonstrated manually and has been shown through design of equipment to be feasible for an automated system. The process offers several attributes which are not, in combination available with any other process. Cross rib-stiffened preforms have been woven by Techniweave, Inc. using carbon fibers with the ribs integrally woven with the panel (skin). Quasi-isotropic fiber orientation was used in both the panel and ribs which can be varied to suit the designers requirements. Z-direction reinforcement was introduced without damage to fibers. Similar methods can be used to fabricate other ceramic fiber preforms. Tecniweave proposes to demonstrate the innovative concept through the fabrication of carbon fiber preforms that will be densified with a carbonaceous matrix by B.F. Goodrich Super-Temp. The quality of the composite will be evaluated through preliminary mechanical properties and compared to the state of the art in carbon-carbon compossites. Further consideration will be given to the design and feasibility of automated equipment that can handle brittle fibers such as carbon and other ceramic fibers. A recommendation will be made with respect to a Phase II program.",

The effect of increasing tax on reducing consumption is measure by price elasticity. Most existing estimates for cigarette price elasticity are national estimates. Hypothetically, price elasticities may differ across states due to various state characteristics and across age-specific groups because of progression of addiction. Therefore, it is important to dervice state-wide and age-specific price elasticity estimates so that precise information about the effects of state tax changes can be provided. To utilize the elasticity estimates for state policy makers, a software needs to be developed to link these estimates with other data such as census estimates. This research will study the feasibility of developing such elasticity estimates and software by: (1) identifying the availability and completeness of state-wide and age-specific database, (2) proposing a \"peer group\" approach to derive elasticity estimates when database is insufficient, and (3) providing estimation test. The results of this study will provide a solid foundation for Phase II research and a template to study other addictive behavior such as alcohol consumption.",

During this project supportability variables will be identified that are common to more than one supportability element and to both equipment and logistics system design. These common variables will require trade studies and the quantification of associated variables. The objectives of this project will be achieved through the performance of five tasks. They are: (1) Identify the significant supportability elements and factors and their relationships as they relate to Operational Supportability (So), Inherent Supportability (Si), and Achieved Supportability (Sa); (2) derive the key drivers of the supportability elements identified and generate a database of supportability factors and a dependency network; (3) identify the mathematical relationships between elements and drivers; (4) identify required trade studies; and (5) finalize the So, Si, and Sa models.",

        "abstract": "Among the most demanding problems for millimeter wave (MMW) radar guided missiles such as that being developed for the Brilliant Antitank (BAT) program is the detection and classification of stationary ground targets in clutter rich environments for autonomous acquisition and terminal homing. This mssion must be met with a high probability of successful classification and a minimal false target density (FTD) to best utilize interceptor resources. The threat for these missions consists of the modern tank formation, assembly areas, choke points, and high-value targets. In addition, it is desirable to commit resources against tanks rather than lower-priority vehicles such as trucks. More sophisticated signal processing techniques are required to detect and classify stationary targets with high probability in a clutter-rich environment (including snow) and to perform aimpoint selection and biasing. Nontraditional techniques include the use of wavelet transformations, fractal-based feature extraction, and neural network processing. Specifically, a MMW seeker will be designed and simulated that will include a wavelet transform processor, a detection and segmentation subsystem, a feature extractor that incorporates a fractal dimensionality feature, and a neural network classifier. Collected data (such as collected under the MLRS/TGW program) will be used to test the system.",

This worldwide proliferation of an NBC offensive capability indicates that U.S. forces must have an integrated NBC defense which includes NBC sensors on ground vehicles in order to operate and survive on the future multi-threat battlefield. Critical to developing and implementing a strong operationally supportive NBC defense posture is the requirement to integrate NBC effects into wargames and simulations. This project will perform a worldwide market survey and technology review to evaluate existing military, commercial, and developmental NBC sensors for use on U.S. Army ground vehicles. Laboratories, military equipment compendiums, subject matter experts, information analysis centers and other on-line data bases will be utilized. The feasability of imbedding and/or interfacing NBC models into existing force-on-force models will be assessed. These results will provide the framework for developing a simulation that accurately models NBC insults and their effects against both system/crew and a force within existing COEA force-on-force models.",

Radioactive imaging with 201T1 is the most frequently employed method for myocardial imaging; radioactive imaging with 201T1 aids in visualizing the blood flow to the various regions of the left ventricular myocardium. High quality 201T1 is produced using the enriched stable isotope 203T1, which is increasingly less available. Recent developments in high resolution laser photoionization using new solid state continuous wave laser technology permit the highly selective enrichment of the minor isotope 203T1 in natural thallium. The successful development of this technology would assure a stable and reasonably priced supply of 203T1 to support 201T1 radioactive imaging needs. The specific aims of this project are to develop a modified thermal atomization thallium source, investigate the photoionization spectroscopy of 203T1, and to determine the potential for isotopically selective ionization and enrichment of 203T1.",

        "abstract": "The development of thin film devices and coatings with an electrically tunable emittance in the 3-5 microns and 8-12 microns spectral bands in proposed. The emittance modulation is based on reversible electrochromic switching in thin films of crystalline transition metal oxides. On electrochemical reduction, these oxides undergo a broadband IR optical transition between that of a wide band gap, transparent semiconductor and a reflective metal. Electrochromic device structures are proposed which allow these oxides to be electrically switched in a continuously adjustable manner between low and high emittance states in reposnse to a low voltage DC signal. Innovation in the use of materials that combine electrical conductivity with either high infrared transmittance or absorptance (emittance) and allow the fabrication of flexible device structures are described. The objective of the Phase I effort is to fabricate and characterize prototype variable emittance devices embodying the innovations proposed. The Phase II effort would expand the base of materials and device designs with the objective of optimizing emittance switching in structures suitable for applications on military platforms.",

        "abstract": "The development of thin film, solid state batteries for microelectronic applications is proposed. The batteries will be fabricated on ceramic substrates suitable for encapsulation in integration circuits using lead frame technology or as discrete components in multichip modules. The batteries are based on a secondary (rechargeable) lithium system that incorporates a high charge capacity oxide cathode and a carbon anode, both deposited by low temperature processes. The principal short term military application for the batteries would be memory protection for CMOS static random access memory (SRAM) in the event of primary power loss. The Phase I program will fabricate and characterize single cell batteries deposited on Si substrates. These batteries will provide O.1 mA-hr at a cell voltage >2V, which is sufficient to maintain 1 megabyte of low power SRAM for more than 24 hours. Battery materials and a multilayer hermetic coating have been chosen to meet military specifications on thermal and environmental stability of integrated circuit components. The Phase II effort would focus on the optimization of battery performance, maximizing both capability, and integrating multiple cells onto a single substrate to allow series and parallel battery configurations to achieve higher cell voltages or greater rate capabilities. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: Many critical or portable data storage and miniaturized electronic devices will benefit from the availability of thin film batteries. Commercial applications of the proposed technology are many. Personal computers, portable communications, and portable data storage systems will all use thin film batteries either for memory backup or as a secondary power source.",

The polymeriztion rate, degree of polymerization, and solubility of polymer will be determined. A 10 cubic foot test cell designed to model a DNAPL will be subjected to GRIP using radiographic sources.

At the present time Li-alloy/FeS2 battery with molten salt electrolyte has the desired characteristics of fast transport and reaction kinetics of the activated materials allowing for the achievement of ultra high specific power from the battery. However, the thermal decomposition of the Fe2 cathode material within the operating temperature range results in loss of obtainable capacity and limited battery lifetimes. We propose to develop new cathode materials with increased thermal stabilities and high discharge rate capabilities compared to FeS2. The cathode materials will consist of single phase mixed transition metal disulfides with the compositions FeX Co(1-X)S2, CoX Ni(1-X)S2 and CuX Ni(1-X)S2. The improved thermal stability, electrode kinetics, and conductivity of the single phase mixed transition metal disulfides are expected to increase the energy and lifetime of the lithium thermal battery.

        "abstract": "An integrated approach to probing the electrophysiology of neural tissue in the normal or pathological state requires multiple electrodes for simultaneous recording of neural activity at different levels in tissue. Typical microelectrodes for single unit recording have high impedances due to the extremely small electrode interface which introduces interference from background noise. This proposal seeks to develop arrays of dimensionally small microelectrodes with high real surface area, high capacitance, and low impedance to minimize unwanted noise in neural recordings. The proposed approach to array fabrication provides an uncomplicated fabricated method, a renewable surface, and the potential for large numbers of sites in a single penetrating probe. The electrode interface will be the cross-sectional exposure of an Ir oxide film sandwiched between two insulators, thus producing a very narrow band electrode. Phase I tasks will determine the optimum film deposition conditions which will produce band microelectrodes with low impedance, low noise, and stable dc potential. All Phase I testing will be done under in vitro conditions but in a simulated in vivo environment. Demonstration of the feasibility of this approach will lead to a Phase II program to develop arrays of recording microelectrodes and demonstration of in vivo neural recording.",

Ideally, any technique employed for nucleic acid analysis should yield not only structural details which will reveal the nucleotide sequence, but will also provide the end user with three dimensional conformational information. For example, the ability to analyze variations in the three dimensional structure of the DNA double helix can lead to an improved understanding of the details of the transfer of genetic traits. We will elucidate structural and conformational information by probing the chiral centers within the nucleic acids via the rapidly maturing spectroscopic technique of Raman Optical Activity (ROA). Efficient utilization of the traditional Raman spectrum as well as the ROA spectrum will enable the end user to determine structural and conformational information from nucleic acid samples. The Phase I objective is to determine the feasibility of rapid structural and conformational identification of nucleosides and nucleotides, the nucleic acid building blocks, with ROA spectroscopy. During the Phase I program, we will attempt to establish the sensitivity levels at which ROA will be capable of rapid detection of nucleic acids and will collect representative spectra from a nucleic acid. During the Phase II, program a more detailed analysis of several nucleic acids will be pursued as well as detailed spectral studies of small (2-4 nucleotide units) oligonucleotides in order to correlate certain ROA spectral features with specified nucleotide sequences and conformations. During the Phase II program a prototype ROA sampling accessory, which can be implemented into any commercial Raman system, will be developed.",

The goal of the contract is to develop a tubular ultramicroelectrode array for use in a detector directly attached to the end of the column to eliminate post- column dispersion of eluent components before detection. The electrode is designed to be rugged and capable of in stiu electrochemical cleaning to overcome potential problems from electrode fouling. Our previous work demonstrated that single element ultramicroelectrodes have amperometric responses proportional to concentration and independent of flow rate over a wide range, but the area definition and stability of the electrodes were inadequate for a commercial analytical device. New materials and fabrication techniques are proposed to overcome these problems and lead to a low-cost \"throw-away\" detector. In Phase I, we will fabricate single and multielement microband electrodes and demonstrate their stability and ability for high sensitivity detection and flow independent amperometric response toward a model redox species and a biogenic amine. Phase II will incorporate these detectors into commercial HPLC instruments and test their performance with model compounds and neurotransmitters injected into microbore columns.

For aircraft operating at high angles of attack and high yaw and roll rates, these criteria are inadequate. A new criteria including yaw and roll rate dependent terms has been developed by Eidetics. To use the criteria, numerical values for these terms must either be calculated or determined from specific dynamic wind tunnel tests covering a large matrix of independent variables such as angle of attack and sideslip, oscillation frequency and amplitude, etc. An alternative to determining the values of these individual parameters is an innovative experimental approach utilizing a multi-axis rotational wind tunnel apparatus. This experimental technique would directly determine the stability and controllability tradeoffs of a model in \"constrained flight\" in response to control inputs from conventional surfaces, thrust vectoring, or other aerodynamic control effectors such as forebody vortex control.

Unfortunately the number of manned players is still too low to accurately represent a real world tactical environment. For example, a typical attack package in Desert Storm involved more than a dozen friendly aircraft, not including support aircraft, such as tankers, AWACS, jammers and defense suppression. If we add a capable air threat, we are clearly beyond the capability of the best force level simulation available today. In short, we have very accurate simulation of aircraft operating in very unrealistic tactical environments.

The former will be fabricated by plasma-assisted metalorganic molecular beam epitaxy (PAMOMBE) and the latter by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). In Phase I, we will first develop electron-cyclotron-resonance (ECR) sources for reactive epitaxy on insulating GaAs substrates, followed by the development of MQW IR detectors. We will design the sources and ultra-high-vacuum fixtures for epitaxy and delineate the PAMOMBE processes to grow MQW devices at a high growth rate and with high-quality epitaxy, and thus cost effectively. 94-GHz MMW integrated circuits will be designed and simulated. In Phase II we will fabricate several MQWs one on top of another forming a vertical stack of IR detectors, each responding to a different spectral band. We will then fabricate a prototype 2-dimensional array of these stacks for multispectral IR imaging and integrate it with a two-dimensional 94-GHz MMW array into a high-performance dual-mode sensor providing real-time and positive non-cooperative identification of friendly forces in combat in all weather conditions.",

THE RESULTANT DETECTOR ARRAYS POSSES FEATURES OF LOW COST, LOW WEIGHT, HIGH RESPONSIVITY, AND HIGH SENSITIVITY. THE LOW COST IS DUE TO A SINGLE BATCH PROCESS IN THE ARRAY FABRICATION. THE LOW WEIGHT IS DUE TO A MONOLITHIC ARRAY STRUCTURE REQUIRING NO COOLING. THE HIGH RESPONSIVITY IS DUE TO A LARGE TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENT OF RESISTIVITY (>15 PERCENT COMPARED TO 0.2 PERCENT FOR A CONVENTIONAL BOLOMETER) OF THE NEW BOLOMETER MATERIAL.

        "abstract": "Bacteriorhodopsin is a new, high speed, erasable, dynamic hologrphic recording material that is an ideal candidate for creating successive multiple holographic exposures in flow visualization. Bacteriorhodopsin is an organic photochromic material, sensitive to sing photon stimulation with picosecond response times. Conventional holographic aero-optic instrumentation has been extremely limited until now by the one-shot nature of silver halide materials. This has limited data taking to either a highly time- resolved single \"slice\" of data, or to time-averaged analysis, neither of which gives invormation on the time development of the flow systems. It is proposed to study the potential of using bacteriorhodopsin to create interferometric \"movies\" to alleviate this difficulty. With its high speed recording capabilities, its high resolution, and its erasability, bacteriorhodopsin has the potential of superseding technology that is already 20 years old. It can be easily integrated into holography systems in place of silver halide materials, with very little change in the experimental set-up. Bacteriorhodopsin has already proven useful in such contexts as: Fourier transform holography, pattern recognition architectures, and 3-D optical memories.",

        "abstract": "A completely new method is proposed to remotely measure the true temperature of substrates during chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes. Conventional radiation pyrometry is not adequate since requires only that the sample be optically polished (specular) and opaque at the measurement wavelengths. These conditions are met for semiconductor and metallic substrates and coating materials of interest in CVD. The method requires a special photometer incorporating a rotating a rotating linear polarizer, and a lamp with a black body calibration, both external to the chamber. True surface temperatures are obtained, which permit tracking of wafers an othersubstrates during CVD deposition, which in general results in significant variations in spectral emissivity. The signal, noise sources, and observation times lead to an expected repeatability and precision better than 1oC are feasible as well. A modified mode of operation can provide surface temperature profile scans with 0.1oC precision. These parameters are a major improvement in radiation pyrometry, and suggest (1) applicatoin to feedback control of CVD for intelligent processing of materials, and (2) a very likely commercial instrument for worl wide sales. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: This technique overcomes inaccuracies in conventioanl radiation pyrometry. Consequently, there are numerous potential applications in industry and science, which now utilize a range of commercial non-contact instruments. The method is perfectly general and can be applied at longer wavelengths and colder temeperatures by suitable adaptation of the instrument parameters.",

These systems will provide features currently unavailable in low cost disposable pumps, such as adjustable flow rates, 5% rate accuracy, delivery rates varying from .01 - 200 mL/hr, and indicators for the volume delivered and the remaining volume, occlusion, completed infusion and low battery. The Phase I objectives will be to design, build and bench-test a working self-propelled syringe that operates up to 10mL/hr. This includes the design of a self-stabilizing plunger, and packaging an electrochemical motor and force sensor into an adaptor that snaps into the barrel of a disposable syringe. Initially, the battery and circuit will be umbilically attached to the adaptor. In Phase II, an autonomous self-contained prototype product will be developed and manufactured for bench and clinical testing. We will take NASA-developed fuel cell technology and commercialize it as a small efficient motor to provide simple, low cost drug delivery devices for continuous infusion. Self-propelled syringes will be designed for home care but will have utility in emergency care, out-patient centers, hospitals, clinical research and veterinary care.",

        "abstract": "This proposed development will result in the first production process for direct electroplating of copper interconnects for microelectronics manufacturing. Technology for direct electroplating processes will be developed. The direct electroplating of interconnects with the ECSI proprietary process produces the highest attainable interconnect conductance. The ECSI process does not need the conventional conducting metalization for cathode current return. By eliminating the need for a common current collector the process significantly simplifies design and manufacturability. Also, this process reduces the importance of current thieves in the plating geometry and in many cases the thieves are potentially eliminated. As a result packaging density can be increased. The elimination of the common current collector connections makes many electroforming applications feasible that otherwise are impossible. The major technology, demonstrations and development milestones are: (1) Establish process for direct electroplate activation of substate (e.g., utilize the Black Hole (TM) technology by MacDermid, Conductron DP(TM) by LeaRonal or other process) reqired for direct electroplating of interconnects. (2) Direct electroplate high density, 10 to 100 micrometer lines and vias on silicon, ceramic and organic substrates. (3) Apply direct electroplating technique with nickel and gold or other metals for interconnects metal finishing. (4) Develop plan to demonstrate the utility of this capability in collaboration with an end user. (5) Prepare business plan to ensure commercail availability of manufacturing equipment. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: This technology will have its largest market in multichip modules MCMs. Multichip modules are increasingly being designed into military systems. Next generation computer workstations will utilize more MCMs and Supercomputer manufacturers including Cray and IBM. Direct eletroplating of interconnects by this efficient ECSI process will play an important role in resolving structural and technological, and by reducing non-recurring engineering costs associated with introducing new designs.",

An alternate polymer deposition method is proposed to meet the objective without the need for expensive, complex sensors and controls. A polymer coating, composed of Teflon and a second resin, is to be deposited electrochemically from aqueous solution. This polymer coating process automatically gives a uniform coating free of pinholes. A pretreatment prepares the surface of aluminum tanks for polymer electrodeposition. The polymer coating process can be adjusted to obtain any coating thickness desired. The polymer coating process uses an aqueous system which obviates expensive enviromental and safety constraints associated with the organic solvents currently-used in coating fuel tanks. Corrosion, fuel-compatibility, and adhesion tests will be carried out to evaluate the coatings. Deliverables from Phase I will be test data and a demonstration small-scale simulated fuel tank. A successful process from Phase II will be licensed to manufacturers.",

        "abstract": "Many shipboard systems and components are fabricated from aluminum alloys because of the high strength to weight ratio, relatively low cost, and ease of manufacturing associated with such materials. Disadvantages in the use of these materials are encountered when a marine service environment is involved - particulary when the aluminum component is in direct contact with a dissimilar metal and large galvanic currents cause severe corrosion. Hard anodizing has been beneficial in detering corrosion but it has poor thermal conductivity. Thick electroless nickel has met with significant success as a corrosion deterrent and has good abrasion and wear resistance. It has much poorer thermal conductivity than most electrodeposited metal coatings and suffers poor ductility when impacted. This proposal offers a unique program for fabrication of families of protective coatings on aluminum alloys where outstanding thermal conductivity can be obtained while providing excellent adhesion to the substrate and ability to conform to damages by surface impact - still retaining good corrosion protection and wear resistance. The process is based on the dilute phosphoric acid anodizing process which provides a very thin galvanic insulator to deter corrosion while forming a bonding media for metallic coatings having properties being sought.",

        "abstract": "Fasteners are used extensively on both military and civilian aircraft structures. Stress concentrations introduced by fastener holes, the intimate contact between these materials dissimilar in nature and/or stiffness and the inherent load transfer demands placed on the fasteners themselves can all lead to problems in service. One of the critical parameters which determines the longevity of a joint's integrity is the preload with which the parts are fastened. A tight joint insures tht the two parts move as one under subjected flight loads and vibrations. Fighter aircraft are particularly susceptible to problems due to the extreme flight, vibration and environmental load conditions experienced in service. Loss of preload initially results in fretting of the joint. This leads to wear of the fastener and/or the substrate material and if undetected to crack initiation and ultimate material failure. The USAF F-15 fighter will be chosen as a typical fighter aircraft for this investigation. With the assistance of McDonnell Douglas Aircraft (MDA), information will be gathered from the F-15 Depot Maintenance organization to identify which locations on service aircraft have experienced grip-loss problems in fastened components. For each problem area, the specific parameters defining the geometry and materials will be determined. Once this data collection is complete, a typical problem area will be selected for the Phase I case study. A selection criteria process will be used to determine which problem area is best suited for more detailed analysis and testing. In the Phase I case study, the service environment of the target area on the F-15 will be estimated from MDA's extensive F-15 database. An empirical case study will be performed to gain a more thorough understanding of the physical phenomenon which causes the fastened joints to lose their preload. Twenty four representative test specimens will be assembled per the existing installation specifications. These specimen will be tested under flight load, vibrational and harsh environmental conditions. Nut torque, joint preload and microstructual analysis will be performed at various time intervals during these te",

For this purpose two approaches have been attempted. Since the circulator is biased below reasonance, frequency tracking conditions may be obtained via suitable use of the dielectric filling material and the subtension angle of the circulator pots. It is hoped that octave bandwidth operation of the device can be ultimately realized. The second approach is based upon the operational principles relating to a waveguide partial-height ferrite junction circulator. Since the field profile in the drop-in circulator junction is analogous to that associated with the partial-height ferrite in a wideguide junction, we believe that the bandwidth of a drop-in circulator can be extended to at least 30% of its center frequency by using metal transformer with a pinning stub. Finally, we propose that hexagonal ferrites shall be used in the fabrication of millimeter wave devices. This elements the need of external biasing field even at high frequency operation of the circulator.",

There are three specific aims: (1) replicate the production of electrically stimulated cough in quadriplegic individuals as reported in two recently published preliminary studies by two separate laboratories, (2) conduct preliminary clinical trials of this method of cough induction in a pulmonary function laboratory where complete quantitative assessment of a cough can be made, and (3) design and build a prototype device that produces a cough when activated (unassisted by a caregiver) by the quadriplegic individual.",

DESCRIPTION: Previous work (Patent 4,802,231) has shown that with proper adaptive learning schemes, interfering acoustic signatures (which tend to obscure or be misrecognized as one of the desired signatures) can be automatically identified, characterized, compared to and deleted from an incoming acoustic data stream. This process enhances the effective signal to clutter ratio and may expose a desired signature buried in a very obscure environment. In a typical use of this approach, sounds that tend to obscure or be trainig and on the fly, into templates defining error classes. These templates are then used to identify and suppress signals from template matching against reference templates. RESEARCH: Develop and code algorithms and exercise in a suitable simualtion testbed. Effort focused on demonstrating ability to perform detection and upon classificaiton accuracy, rather than on real time performance.",

        "abstract": "A 6-month, Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program is proposed to conduct proof-of-principle work on a novel process which uses momentum transfer mechanisms and liquid carbon dioxide for all-dry wafer cleaning. Under an earlier, Phase I project, the basic principle of momentum transfer has been demonstrated as effective, using high purity liquid carbon dioxide sprays accelerated by high pressure, dry, filtered air. Test coupons of polished silicon wafers were used, with particulate contamination and finger prints as materials to be removed. Continuation of this line of approach has been proposed in a Phase II application. Newer, proprietary approaches to momentum transfer are described in the present Phase I application, with refinements which should provide some potential improvements in purification and filtration demands, materials conservation and spray control. This approach appears to be adaptable to processing of VLSI materials and silicon substrates, and carries substantial advantages in comparison with supercritical fluid/US technologies for these applications. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: Substitution of CO2 for CFC-113 in cleaning of electronic and mechnanical parts will have on impact on the order of 19% of the billion kilograms of CFCs consumed on the global market (1986) estimate). These solvents are used domestically to produce about $5 billion in goods. Beneficial impacts on aerospace, biotechnology and electronic industries can come if bening, effective and low cost solvents are identified.",

Smooth tungsten anodes have low emissivity ~0.3 that severely limits radiative cooling heat transfer can be increased 300% by improvements in emissivity, and thereby significantly increase arcjet power. Prior attempts to increase tungsten emissivity have problems: ceramic coatings tend to flake off under high temperature cyclic arcjet operation and surface roughening by arc and sputter texturing does not succeed on tungsten. This project will investigate a novel processing technique for texturing surfaces with small diameter fibers. The process involves the application of short fiber flock and a chemical vapor deposition coating to obtain high density, well oriented, large aspect-ratio microcavities on substrate materials such as tungsten, carbon and refractory ceramics. In Phase I, a series of carbon fiber flocked samples will be prepared and characterized to aid modeling of the infrared optical properties of flocked surfaces and to guide design. Sample tungsten surfaces will then be prepared and characterized at high temperature to assess the feasibility of the approach for arcjet anodes. Other anode materials will be surveyed and the potential benefits for arcjet propulsion will be assessed. Other potential optical and thermal applications will be surveyed. In Phase II, the process would be developed and prototype anodes would be fabricated for testing under arcjet relevant conditions.",

HBO therapy is based on the premise that oxygen at pressure greater than atmospheric provides enhanced healing. The major cost component of any HBO treatment center is the structure that contains the elevated pressure. Conventional practice has been to use steel pressure vessel technology for fabrication of HBO chambers. Accordingly, HBO chambers are cylindrical in shape. Medical HBO practitioners want rectanglar rooms instead of cylindrical chambers. Patients are often frightened by the appearance of a large steel cylinder. Rectangular rooms give better space utilization and can be integrated directly into the hospital. The rectangular room cannot be economically constructed using conventional steel pressure vessel practice; but concrete offers an economic alternative. A USAF study showed cost savings potential of 70% using concrete. Commercialization of this technology awaits proof of concept. The objective of this study is to construct and test of a full size rectangular concrete pressure vessel for human occupance (RCPVHO). The Phase I technical objective is to develop a detailed design of a full size prototype RCPVHO. Construction drawings and specifications will be prepared and a testing plan generated.",

Experiments will also be conducted to demonstrate CMA production by extraction of acetic acid and reaction with lime. The design and economics of a commercial facility will be projected to demonstrate economic feasibility.

        "abstract": "There is evidence that the excitotoxic action resulting from excessive accumulation of L-glutamate plays a prominent role in human epilepsy and brain ischemia/stroke, leading to neuronal dysfunction and cell death. The triazolines and the aminoalkylpyridine metabolite analogues are a group of novel anticonvulsants; they are be effective in the kindling and in the maximal electroshock seizure models of epilepsy, the best analogies to human partial seizures, and work by impairing excitatory amino acid neurotransmission at both post and presynaptic sites. Thus, it appears logical to expect that the anticonvulsant triazolines and metabolite analogues may have some beneficial therapeutic potential in cerebral ischemia. Our objective is to assess the ability of these anticonvulsants to reduce or prevent neuronal damage utilizing the bilateral carotid occlusion model in unanesthetized gerbil, which eliminates the protective effect of anesthesia as a variable. The gerbils undergo a predictable pattern of behavioral changes; the effects of drugs on these changes in producing alterations in this pattern will be monitored by determining the postischemic changes in spontaneous locomotor activity as well as by changes in radial arm maze performance. The postischemic changes in locomotor activity provide a reliable and reproducible first assessment data on neurological status. The applicant provides fairly extensive review of the triazoline anticonvulsants and their possible dual action mechanism for impairing excitatory amino acid neurotransmission. Basically, there is some evidence that suggests that the triazolines affect the post synaptic excitatory amino acid receptor as well as the presynaptic release of L- glutamate. This dual action mechanism may make these compounds rather potent in combating the neurotoxic effects of excessive excitatory amino acid release following injury and/or epilepsy. The applicant also cites evidence suggesting that the triazolines are lipophilic and can cross the blood brain barrier where the prodrug form enters the brain and then is metabolized within it. Most NMDA antagonists which are potent anticonvulsants and neuroprotective agents in a variety of tests must be administered into the ventricles because their activity is compromised when administered systemically. The basic protocols to be used include the measurement of locomotor activity following acute doses to determine direct behavioral effects of these drugs. Then the effects of pre-treatment doses on the outcome of a five minute period of bilateral carotid occlusion will be tested, and finally the effects of administration of these compounds after an ischemic attack where treatment has been initiated. These appear to be fairly simple types of approaches.",

Such a device is intended for medical professionals to permit them to better control and monitor treatments involving theophylline, especially asthma.

Unlike EMIT, the device utilizes the principles of analog-to-digital color control chemistry to give direct readout of theophylline concentration without the use of instruments or conversion charts. By using saliva as specimen, this assay will permit convenient, repeated assessment of theophylline status. Its availability should encourage theophylline dosage by individual titration; the experiment may have a concomitant increase in the effectiveness of treatment and a decrease in side effects and expense related to overdose.",

But the perceptual demands of new aircraft display systems, and indeed the tasks of out-the-window performances (landing, low-level attack, etc.) in aviation may involve temporal acuity (e.g., motion perception) as much as spatial acuity. Further, an inability to \"switch\" attention and fixation rapidly from one visual display to another is more likely related to temporal than spatial visual systems and may be a major factor in the aviation \"human error\" component. We hypothesize that individuals differ in their temporal visual accuity and, if so, then measures which tap this capability could be predictive of success in flight training as well as aviation operational performance. There is a large literature devoted to temporal factors in vision, and there is neurophysiological evidence that independent retino-cortical pathways are used for motion perception. flicker, and meta contrast when compared to color vision and fine-line acuity. So far as we know, there are no direct measures of temporal acuity which are used as selection criteria for pilots. In Phase I, we propose to implement a battery of such tests on a computer and determine whether performance on such tests is: (a) reliable enough to be a suitable predictor, (b) uncorrelated with other existing aptitude measures, and (c) uncorrelated with existing tests of spatial acuity.",

The battery will incorporate three innovative features that are important for effective assessment of children's cognitive functioning and are not included on any other early childhood assessment battery. These features are 1) assessment of a broad range of abilities, 2) assessment of abilities as separately as possible, and 3) assessment of the same abilities across the entire age range of the test. These features make possible the identification of a child's cognitive strengths and weaknesses, the use of a single subtest to assess a particular ability, and the evaluation of intellectual growth longitudinally. The goal of Phase I work would be the construction of the assessment battery; therefore, we will utilize data already obtained from the testing of a national sample of children on eleven tasks that assess central components of cognitive and neurological functioning. Item Response Theory and the three-parameter statistical model would be used to create a set of scales that have the best statistical qualities across the age and ability range covered by the test.",

        "abstract": "Residual stress in thin-film materials resulting from thermal and chemical strains is a continuing problem in the synthesis of superconducting thin films. The probelm exists not only in the superconducting layers, but also in the dielectric layer used as a buffer. Models that can analyze and predict the film stresses and accompanying mechanical failure are extremely useful as a starting point in the design of a multilayer circuit. The present program jointly proposed by Excel Superconductor, Inc. and North Carolina State University addresses this need. Computer modeling of typical multilayer structures containing superconducting thin films, dielectric layers and metal layers will be model as well as provide feed back information to improve the model. The proposed research will enable us to determine the key factors responsible for the stresses developed in the processing of the films, mode of failure of the films by introduction of flaws and voids. This information will forecase the success of any particular HTS based thin-film device. In Phase I such a study will be carried out for TBCO/LaA103 and metal/TBCO/YSZ/Si systems, issues for Phase II will be identified for the use of the model for other systems. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: When fully developed, the model could predict the mechanical performance of multilayer thin-film structures in a particular geometry. This will aid the selection of mechanically correct circuit designs suitable for any particular application like semiconductor interconnects, SQUIDS and hybrid electronic circuits.",

Of growing interest has been the integration of sensors into airfoil components, both to look outward at the behavior of the flow, and to look inward at the temperature and strain in the component itself. Surface-mounted sensors may allow measurement of the growth, spatial distribution and frequency content of instability waves in hypersonic boundary layers. Such measurements are required in the short term to aid in airfoil design and testing, and in the long term as part of active control surface instrumentation. Fiber and Sensor Technologies(F&S) proposes to investigate the feasibility of novel types of surface-mounted optical fiber sensors, based in part on fiber strain gage concepts commercialized by F&S, have been demonstrated by F&S and their subcontractor, the Fiber & Electro-Optics Research Center at Virginia Tech, for detection of stress wave displacement fields on and in metals, ceramics and composites.

        "abstract": "Existing, continuum-based models of plasticity cannot account for the Baushcinger effect and other asymmetries in plastic flow. This is because the Bauschinger effect has its origin in atomic-scale lattice defects known as dislocations. Dislocation propagation causes local shears, subject to rigid selection rules, which are not part of the continuum framework. Specifically, when obstacles to plastic flow are present, such as non-deformable dispersoids, the local dislocation density increases with deformation to satisfy compatibility conditions. On refersal of the applied stress, this excess dislocation content collapses and leads to a reduced flow stress, the classical Bauschinger effect. There are other asymmetries in plastic flow which are similarly not part of the continuum picture. The logical approach to this problem is to develop a model in terms of the fundamental defect, the dislocation. The proposed research will be aimed at a fully interacting many-dislocation numerical model, incorporating all of the lattice-based properties of dislocations. In Phase I, the model will be fully defined, and limited computer codes to demonstrate the feasibility of the project will be constructed. Particular attention will be devoted to high strain rate and low temperature conditions, and to interfacing to standard continuum methods.",

The commercial telecommunications industry has developed the second generation of wireless digital mobile communications technology. This emerging Spread Spectrum digital cellular technology has characteristics of impportance in secure DoD applications. These characteristics include low probability of intercept, low user power consumption, soft handoff and reduced frequency planning. These features can be combined with intelligent switch features to support the unique features required by DoD users. These switch architectures provide a capbility for scaling the size of the systems to meet the requirements of the transportable systems. The modular and layered implementations provide the protocol independence necessary to support continuing system evolution to new capabilities and standards.

Other groups of researchers have shown that the Wavelet Transform can be used to accurately and efficiently measure the fractal dimensions of signals by examining the behavior of the transformed signals across scales. We propose to marry these two concepts into a signal preprocessor in which the Wavelet Transform will compute the local fractal dimensions of HRR returns, and those fractal dimensions will form a feature vector which will be used by neural network pattern classifiers to distinquish targets in the backscattered signal. We will also investigate the applicability of two other Wavelet processing techniques for radar signal processing: the use of the Adaptive Wavelet Transform to extract key target features and the use of doppler-tolerant wavelet radar pulses.",

This project will implement a unique new analysis capability to analyze and assess a novel propulsion device that could greatly enhance applications in the hypersonic class of flight vehicles. The ODW Hy-Scram Engine is configured to use gas dynamic wave interactions to provide inlet stream primary compression (after vehicle forebody compression), bulk ignition, and rapid combustion. The major advanatages over previous Scramjet engines are: 1) use of the vehicle forebody for fuel injection and complete mixing (due to longer distances, lower temperatures and lower pressures than is typical in the inlet fuel injection systems of Scramjet Engines), 2) simpler and shorter inlet design due to lower Mach range through which the flow must be decelerated (typically incorporated into the vehicle forebody), and 3) shorter and simpler combustor design. The primary benefit of this approach is the reduction of the weight associated with the propulsion system for a given combustion efficiency. The secondary benefit is stabilized combustion due to the bulk ignition of the fuel and oxidizer in the stable over driving of the oblique detonation wave.",

Unfortunately, long-term survival and quality of life for transplant recipients are still severely diminished. Recently, the natural products, FK-506 and rapamycin, have proven in studies to be safe, more potent, and more effective than cyclosporin. Furthermore, these drugs appear to act synergistically possibly because they interfere with different pathways of the immune response. Novel chemically-synthesized analogs of FK-506 and rapamycin have helped elucidate the mechanism of action of these drugs. Other new analogs could lead to less toxic drugs or new choices for combination therapy. We will develop genetic technology as an alternative to chemical synthesis for producing novel analogs. In Phase I, a genetic system would be developed in the producing micro-organism. In Phase II, the genetic tools would be used to manipulate the biosynthetic pathway by targeted gene inactivation or replacement. Analogs with tailored structural modifications could be produced inexpensively through fermentation. Novel structures would be patented, biologically tested, and open to licensing for clinical testing or further chemical development by interested partners.",

The proposed flow FFF/filtration system utilizes the separation power of flow FFF in the first dimension and the rapid filtration and concentration power of membrane technology in the second dimension. Our initial evaluation on several commercially available membranes indicate a satisfactory match of the desired basic membrane properties with the measured molecular weight cut-off and sample recovery. The expected outcome to this development is a preparative scale rapid biomedical purification system which should certainly benefit many biomedical research and applications in bio-engineering and pharmaceutical industries.",

        "abstract": "A lens system even if very complicated, when computer simulated (i.e., in a \"virtual reality\") will function, under appropriate circumstances, as if it were real. This system requires coherent illumination of the target, so a laser or microwave source is needed, but a microchip would do the focusing. The reflected wave from the target is used as input and a picture of the reflecting object is produced. Output would be to anything accepting an electronic signal (broadcast, video monitor, etc.). It will work with any radiation for which a source and detector can be built: microwaves, visible light, sonar, etc. The \"virtual\" lens systems can be as exotic and perfect as mathematical description will allow. It is always aligned and can have elements overlapping in space or made of materials which do not exist in nature. As long as elements and materials can be described mathematically, they can be used. The detector does no focusing itself and therefore should be resistant to input overload. Other systems now in use (like radar) do not image except at a crude level. Only reflectiveity and size are measured, and then ambiguously. Very large objects, like weather systems, can be displayed, but in detail no smaller than a beama width. The Phase I project will be a computer simulation to establish feasibility. Particular emphasis will be placed on examination of optical element design and system configuartions.",

        "abstract": "Foster-Miller has previously developed an attachment scheme for 2-D carbon-carbon (C/C) composites which, compared to a conventinal braze or mechanical joint, would enhance the thermal and mechanical efficiency of space structures. Developed for NASP applications, the design is comprised of a metal brazed joint that is integrally reinforced by transverse (Z-direction) pins. Preliminary results reveal a threefold increase in joing strength and up to 50% increase in through-thickness thermal conductivity. Unfortunately, as in the case for most C/C brazing research being conducted in the US, Foster-Miller's process has been developed for a vacuum furnace. Real military space structures, such as the Space Based Radar or Survivable Power Subsystem, involve complex truss structures that may exceed 350 ft in length. The space structure manufacturing community would certainly benefit from the development of an out-of-furnace on-line joining for sequential assembly of large structures. Foster-Miller proposes to demonstrate that RF induction heating is the key to implementing the Z-direction reinforced brazed joint on the shop floor. Induction heating is rapid, highly localized and involves inexpensive, easy-to-use equipment. By using high strength electrically conductive fibers as reinforcement, the Z-fibers will not only provide performance advantages, but may overcome some of the heating uniformity problems associated with RF heating of anisotropic composites. Based on materials and applications inputs from Rockwell-Space Systems and Lockheed Missile and Space Company and induction equipment expertise from Ameritherm Inc., the Phase I program will focus on understanding the interaction of the C/C adherends, Z-direction fibers, and brzae with the induction coil and machine parameters. Brazed joints will be subjected to mechanical and thermal conductivity tests. Phase II would involve process optimization and development of a prototype fabrication line.",

In this program, Foster-Miller will demonstrate the huge advances that are possible by applying advanced materials technology, including blends of high performance polymers such as LaRC-TPI 1500/Xydar, to the production of new forms of foam and honeycomb core materials for aircraft applications. The use of these advanced polymeric materials in cores would make available thermally stable, melt-processible sandwich structures which are strong and stiff, lightweight, insensitive to moisture, and dimensionally-stable. Using our extensive processing experience with advanced polymers and their blends, and making use of the expertise of teaming partners Hexcel and Vought, Foster-Miller will examine the feasibility and practicality of honeycomb cores made from these materials. Furthermore, we will examine the ability to fabricate foam core materials which have 2 to 3 times the specific stiffness of the best aerospace foam material currently available. The work plan provides a balanced and coordinated approach including analysis, processing experiments, production of actual core material, and determination of core material properties. Also included is an economic analysis of the potential cost of the advanced core material in production.",

Research indicates that there is no mechanical tracker now or expected in the far reaching future which can surpass the human eye in acquisition, recognition and tracking. Efforts should be aimed at taking maximum advantage of this capability. Foster-Miller proposes a research and development effort which has the principal objectives of: Fielding an advanced target acquistion and weapon control system which uses the gunner's tracked line of gaze as the man-machine interface and target acquisition method building upon the user's inherent skills. Futher devloping the Visual Trackball System which in recent Navy development programs and testing has proven to be faster and more accurate than conventional systems based on hand and eye coordination skills. Designing the VTS with the intention of integrating advanced options as the state of the art in weapons, battlefield management, and IFF techniques continue to advance. The Foster-Miller Visual Targeting System (VTS) uses a gimbal mounted camera, infrared light source and computer algorithm to determine where on a standard monitor that the gunner is looking and then forms a reticle at that point. The VTS requires that nothing be mounted on the gunner's head and will be feasible for the control of individual, crew served or vehicle mounted line-of-sight weapon systems, as well as indirect fire weapons. The VTS will provide for rapid, on the move target acquistion limited only by the range of the sensor suite used. Development of this type weapon control system was started under a NSWC program for the AEGIS workstation. Tests conducted under this program indicate that this type system, even when not optimized for this task can decrease the reticle positioning time in excess of 50 percent on moving targets.",

The work suggested in this proposal takes the first steps toward assessing the feasibility of creating an off-design performance tool that is appropriate for conceptual design applications.

These coatings would chemically bond to the native oxide on aluminum to form a corrosion protection barrier that gradually transistions into a region with suitable functionality for chemically interacting with the adhesive. Fundamental research on functionally gradient sol-gel coatings derived from tetraethoxysilane/aminoalkyltriethoxysilane mixtures has produced lap-shear joints exhibiting significantly improved environmental resistance. However, these coatings are subject to abrasive damage, resulting in substrate corrosion. Altering the composition of this functionalized region and electrophoretic processing (if required) to increase the coating hardness and density would allow more damage tolerant coatings to be formulated. Incorporating modified-transition metal alkoxides (whose oxides are harder than silica) and modified-alkoxysilanes (for adhesive bonding) will improve the hardness and adhesion characteristics of the coating. In Phase I, Foster-Miller will team with Lord Corporation and Lockheed to evaluate and select materials and apporaches to generate functionally gradient sol-gel coatings on aluminum alloys that provide corrosion protection and good adhesive surfaces.

        "abstract": "The development of very high bandwidth reconfigurable optical interconnects is one of the important goals of present optics research. Direct broadcast interconnect schemes offer the advantage of high data rate free-space optical signals and an inherent immunity to vibration. However, in the past this technique has suffered from poor signal to noise ratio and an inability to reconfigure the network interconnections. Foster-Miller proposes to overcome these prior disadvantages by developing an electrically controlled wavelength-tunable filter which allows each detector to receive one signal with high selectivity and to reconfigure the network by changing receiving wavelengths. This device enables a broadcast interconnect scheme which is simple, low cost, reconfigurable, extendable and immmune to mechanical or vibration problems. For this program we will exploit the unique properties of a new holographic film that can be reliably and repeatedly tuned with an applied voltage at millisecond speeds. The technique involves the combination of liquid crystals in a polymer holographic host. The goal of the Phase I effort will be to demonstrate selective wavelength tuning over a 5 to 10 percent bandwidth with diffraction efficiencies approaching 99 percent. The potential reconfiguration speed of the network ranges between milliseconds and microseconds, while the bandwidth of the data transfer may be in the 100 GB/s range. Commercialization issues will be explored with our partner Polaroid Corporation.",

Liquid crystall polymer with low moisture permeability provides a hermetic seal in the interconnect. Laser drilled blind vias allow routing in the multilayer built with the LCP to achieve a high density of pads per square inch in the package array. Our innovative design includes a metal matrix cover sealed onto the substrate to provide efficient thermal management. This approach can handle high I/O (800 or more) wafer scale packaging as well as three dimensional stacks of MCMs. No other polymer-based approach can provide a hermetic package. Ceramic-based approaches are too expensive or cannot be implemented in such a space efficient manner. The multilayer substrate approach based on LCP also offers superior electrical properties. The substrate layers could be readily increased to provide features such as power distribution planes to control the characteristic impedance which will enable higher bandwidth applications. The material Foster-Miller uses can be fabricated with photo-lithography techniques used in thin film and is readily scalable to much higher I/O pin counts than conventional approaches. In Phase I, teaming with a Micro-Pak, laser drilling of LCP and hermetic sealing will be demonstrated by building several prototypes which will also show the thermal management technology and the circuit routing that provides the high density.

By utilizing entirely recycled feedstock (both matrix and reinforcement), Foster-Miller's construction material will be both cost-effective and at the same time will address one of the major problems confronting the United States today -- lack of land fill space. Since carbon fiber is the reinforcement of choice (modulus of 200 GPa and strength of 2700 MPa), Foster-Miller's innovative recycled construction material should also overcome the mechanical property limitations of current reinforced recycled plastics. With proper interfacial control between the reinforcement and the plastic matrix, our construction material should have mechanical properties competitive with wood.

By consulting with a leading researcher in the field of recycled plastics during Phase I, they will be able to maximize the pace of technical development during Phase I.

Supercritical extraction has several advantages over conventional processes including benign solvents, enhanced mass transfer, and the inherent capability of separating mixtures of extracted material. However, supercritical extraction is not generally applied to inorganic substances because these are relatively insoluble in non-polar solvents such as supercritical carbon dioxide. Up to now, this has excluded the possibility of treating by supercritical solvent extraction the many metal-containing hazardous waste streams generated in DOD operations. The proposed program involves (a) the synthesis of a number of CO2-soluble complexing agents specific to either mercury or depleted uranium, (b) measurements of the solubility of the complelxing agents in CO2 and the metal extraction efficiencies in soil, and (c) estimating the capital and operating cost of the super-critical solvent extraction process.",

        "abstract": "The process of \"pumping\" water by electroosmosis has been used for dewatering and stabilizing soils since the 1930s, and has more recently been evaluated for treating groundwater contaminated with dossolved organics and toxic metals. Electroosmosis is particularly effective in fine pores where hydraulic pumping fails, particularly as its flow can be accurately directed. A modified process is proposed in which water is used to purge dense, non-aqueous phase (organic) liquids (DNAPLs) which are not normally susceptible to electroosmotic forces. An important advantage of this approach is that the purge liquid can be used to introduce surfactants that will enhance the rate of desorption and so remove absorbed DNAPLs that would otherwise continue to be a long-term source aquifer contamination. This in situ approach is expected to have energy costs of the order of $1/ton of soil treated and so offers significant cost savings over conventional extraction processes. The concept is to be demonstrated in a 10 ft3 test cell after determining operating parameters in a series of small-scale tests. In addition to the experimental investigation, the utility of a simplified theoretical model for design calculations and for predicting performance will be explored.",

The basic electronic interaction in NLOP yields high elector-optic coeffiecients with low dielectric constant resulting in potential device operation at speeds exceeding 100 GHz. For this effort Foster-Miller proposes to develop a unique integrated optic structure in NLOP materials which is capable of near instantaneous steering of an input laser beam. The device consists of a channel waveguide/electrode array, which will be computer modeled in Phase I. Also during Phase I, channel waveguide structures will be developed in NLOP material and completely characterized for the beam steering application. During Phase II a complete breadboard integrated optic chip will be fabricated in NLOP and completely characterized for microwave operation. The team of scientists from Foster-Miller and the University of Lowell assembled for this project are uniquely qualified for this effort with many years of experience in NLOP preparation, NLOP optical and electrical measurements, characterization of very high speed integrated optic devices.",

Such batch type heaters are very slow and inefficient and have no provision for filling the tank from its source of cold water, nor for supplying a pressurized flow for effective use of the hot water, unless electrical or enginer driven water pumps are utilized. Foster-Miller is proposing a self powered, light weight and highly efficient resonant pulse jet burner capable of meeting the U.S. Army's requirements for a nonpowered instantaneous hot water heater. It can be powered by a wide selection of liquid fuels such as gasoline, kerosene and turbine fuels. The proposed resonant pulse jet burner an extension of resonant pulse jet tubes used in insect foggers has been successfully started and tested over a temperature range from -35 F to 100 F. The instant hot water heater features a pressurized, counterflow design with built-in steam dome from which steam can be withdrawn for the operation of a piston type boiler feedwater pump. The projected design - when fully developed - will be capable of delivering approximately 35 gal/hr of pressurized hot water at an outlet temperature of 160 F.

Frequent inspection intervals become necessary as dictated by the worst case aircraft of that make/model. These inspections usually require aircraft teardown which could cause damage itself. Individual aircraft monitoring would elimanate the need for fleet-wide grounding and inspection and allow for a tailored inspection/repair program. The concept proposed consists of tagging the aircraft structure with magnetostrictive particles which would generate signatures based on the loading history of the structure. This concept allows for quick, accurate, easily accessable inspection of the aircraft structure.

Similar possibilities exist for data returned from millimeter wave radar guidance. To date, however, fractal characterization of captured image data has been considered too computationally intensive for real-time respone. Foster-Miller has develped a real-time \"fractal image sensor\" which instantaneously measures fractal dimension by using a parallel optical coprocessor based on photorefractive non-linear optics. By reducing complex image textures to a small fractal feature vector, electronic neural networks can also be applied to the coprocessor output for training on more subtle fractal characteristics. Phase I research will test the applicability of the fractal optical coprocessor to a database of typical IR/thermal imagery and also evaluate the potential for an all-electronic implementation. Phase II will construct a complete hybrid optical/electronic thermal image computer incorporating image segmentation and analysis, fractal modeling and synthesis, a dedicated fractal coprocessor for high speed characterization, and neural network training.",

This protection system consists of two components, an overhead cover (OHC) for ballistic protection and a revetment system to support the walls of the IFP against blast loadings. Foster-Miller proposes to develop and demonstrate an IFP-OHC system which will meet the IFP revetment and ballistic requirements in a standardized but tailorable kit while minimizing installation time and maximizing the protection level provided to the infantry soldier. The system is based on a composite batten and fabric revetment frame and a laminatEd composite sandwich OHC panel fitted with threat specific applique armor. This methodology provides requisite protection from direct (7.62 mm) and indirect fire threats (155 mm), including overpressure from point detonating and airburst artillery, as well as IFP wall collapse caused by delay fuzed artillery rounds.",

        "abstract": "Improvement to machine gun type automatic weapons is limited by the wear and erosion rates on current gun barrel materials. The technology exists for increasing rates of fire and muzzle velocities with new projectiles. These advanced projectiles develop significantly higher flame temperatures and bore pressures. Gun barrel erosion is accelerated by the combination of the high temperature gas erosion and the friction between the projectile and liner. Significant improvements to accuracy and lethality can be realized with improved gun barrels that withstand these advanced projectiles. The proposed program combines the experience of Saco Defense, Inc. and Foster-Millers's unique gun barrel design concept to produce a structure capable of withstanding the severe erosive environment, providing for greatly enhanced thermal conductivity both through and along the barrel axis. A ceramic liner will be used at the bore with a reinforcing carbon-carbon (C-C) sleeve. The C-C sleeve will be embedded with radial P100 graphite fibers using Foster-Miller proprietary technology. P100 fibers exhibit among the highest thermal conductivities known and will be used along the barrel axis as well. The unique properties of C-C materials to increase liner compression with temperature, because of the negative CTE, will overcome a common problem encountered with metallic sleeves. The program will entail design, fabrication, and testing of a typical liner/sleeve assembly in Phase I. The thermally induced strains, confirmed in Phase I, will form the basis of a Phase II program which will include rapid fire testing of the gun barrel.",

These performance evaluations, together with qualitative assessments of operational complexity, robustness and any adverse impacts on cost and system utility, will provide a basis for recommending one or more of the techniques for further development and evaluation in Phase II of the program. The Phase I program also will specify the technology requirmeents, design data requirements and development requirements, for the selected techniques and recommend a Phase II program plan designed to achieve those goals.",

It is shown in this proposal that FC is a process with wide-ranging capability for recycling materials that are now disposed of as waste and for meeting the increasingly stringent limits on air and water discharges from industrial facilities. This process is generally applicable to both aqueous and organic-based solutions and will provide high quality purity treated water for discharge, regardless of the type of contaminant that is in it. Potential applications for this technology include: recycling paint stripping solvents that are now incinerated (e.g., dichlorobenzene and normal-methyl pryollidone); more complete removal of VOCs, semi-volatile compounds, heavy organics, heavy metals and radionuclides from contaminated effluents and groundwater; decontamination of aviation fuels; recycling of all effluents from metal finishing operations; decontamination and rejuvenation of acid and alkaline cleaning bathes.",

        "abstract": "When loading nitrogen tetroxide before launching the space shuttle, fugitive N2O4 is absorbed into caustic solutions in a two stage scrubber solution. The second stage of the scrubber has sodium sulfite added to the alkaline scrubbing solution to act as an oxidant scavenger, to improve scrubbing efficiency. The N2O4 oxidant reacts with water and with the sulfite to form acids (neutralized by the alkalinity in the solution) and sulfates. The residual caustic concentration makes the spent solution a characteristic hazardous waste. This proposal addresses an approach that uses freeze crystallization to crystallize sodium nitrate and sodium sulfate salts from the spent scrubbing solution, to remove part of the water in the spent solution as pure ice, and thus to concentrate and purify the residual hydroxide alkalinity so that it can be reused in the scrubbing operation. To improve the efficiency in removing the nitrate and sulfate salts, nitrites and sulfites will be oxidized by adding air. Testing here will determine whether this needs to be a pressurized reaction, or if atmospheric conditions are sufficient. The hydroxide can be crystallized from the treating solution if necessary to recover it at higher concentrations or in ultra-high purity.",

The study will have two specific aims: 1) determine the precise site of ZDV absorption (stomach vs jejunum vs colon), and 2) Determine whether GI absorption of ZDV is enhanced or compromised by AIDS-associated enteropathy. Patients taking ZDV will be recruited for a four-way randomized crossover pharmacokinetic study. Each will receive ZDV 100 mg on four occasions: IV (control), stomach release, mid-jejunal release, and release at the ileocecal valve. ZDV and its metabolite (GZDV) will be assayed in collected bloods using RIA. Pharmacokinetic comparison will be made using AUC values after data fitting. Neither of the two specific aims have previously been addressed because there has not been a method capable of precise, but non-invasive oral delivery to these GI sites.

Although this is a successful solution to achieve a working dye lser system with tunability over a broad spectrum, there are also significant limitations to the full realization of the potentail ofthis medium. Primarily, liquid hosts adversely affect the thermodynamic, spectroscopic, and kinetic properties of the dye. In addition, disadvantages such as flammability, toxicity and leakage of carcinogens make these laser rods unsafe to handle. In order to create more sophisticated and highly manageable compact systems, a solid state dye laser is an attractive and beneficial concept to consider as a replacement for current liquid dye lasers. GELTECH, Inc. proposes in this Phase I program, to develop prototype dye lasers by impregnation of a porous glass host made from their patented sol-gel process to demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating solid state dye lasers with improved efficiency and lower production costs. This approach can provide important advantages over the current sol-gel methods under development in other companies and universities. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: The ability to have a tunable solid state dye laser that avoids the complex dye-flow systems currently used will enable flexible designs of convenient, storable, lighweight systems at a lower cost. This will impact such commercial applications such as therapeutic medicine, dermatology and urology. Benefits to military applicatoins include remote sensing, laser blinders, and BW/CW devices.",

The processing is completely autonomous in extracting the necessary information from sensor inputs, in processing, and final decision-making. In addition to the traditional military applications, ATR algorithms can be adopted to endow a mobile sentry robot with the capability to detect intruder generated phenomena. Monocular parallax extracted by tracking objects viewed from a mobile CCD camera is converted to three-dimensional (3-D) position estimates. Simulations have demonstrated that (l) the resolution and accuracy at which a robot can sample its environment using a mobile CCD camera is significantly greater than that achieved using sonar (2) by comparing perceived angular motion of objects in its environment with that expected of Stationary objects, the robot can detect body movement of an intruder while on the move, and (3) 3-D position estimates of objects in the robot's environment can be exploited for autonomous navigation, obstacle avoidance, and map generation. It is proposed that the aforementioned capability be complemented with processing and hardware subsystems which detect different types of intruder generated phenomena as follows: By comparing the 3-D position of objects as determined on the first patrol with that of objects as determined on subsequent patrols, the robot can detect a Stationary intruder or disappearance of possessions. Also, microphones would allow the robot to detect an intruder which it can \"hear\" not \"see.\"",

Another innovative feature is the drive linkage which gives the pistions the correct phase relationship whith a near straight line motion to minimize side forces and wear. The use of ambient air as the working fluid eliminates the need for special refrigerants, such as chlorofluorocarbons, and the hazard of leakage in confined environments and pollution of the atmosphere.

We have designed and incorporated an internucleotidic linkage as part of an oligonucleotide structure that retains the base-recognition properties, aqueous solubility and achirality of natural deoxyoligonucleotides. An octamer was prepared via solid phase phosphoramidite methodology using standard reagents and protocols. Initial binding studies indicate thermal stability to complementary RNA comparable to the natural cogener. Interestingly, no binding to complementary DNA was detected suggesting a new class of RNA specific hybridization agents. We will synthesize the necessary cyanoethylphosphoramidites and derivatized supports in order to prepare oligomers for additional hybridization and nuclease stability studies. Future work will focus on the synthesis and evaluation of antisense oligonucleotides containing this internucleotidic linkage to inhibit protein synthesis in a cell culture model system.",

Genetic Vectors has developed a chemical procedure for incorporation of detectable labels into nucleic acids. It is capable of attaching virtually any detectable label to nucleic acids in a configuration that does not hinder Watson-Crick bonding. This new procedure has a variety of applications from labeling probes and primers to measuring trace levels of nucleic acids. One of the primary commercial applications of the EpiDNA\u00bf technology is its use for the preparation of labeled probes and primers by direct labeling of existing polynucleotides and oligonucleotides. In the studies outlined here, we will establish basic conditions for the rapid direct labeling of nucleic acids. The results of these studies will provide the basis for development of a line of commercial products, marketed under the trademark EpiDNA\u00bf, including nucleic acid assays, kits for preparation of labeled probes and primers, guanine derivatives for chemical and enzymatic synthesis of labeled nucleic acids, new derivatives of detectable molecules for labeling nucleic acids and pre-labeled probes for clinical and veterinary diagnostics.",

Initial testing has shown its detonation performance is superior to that of HMX, outperforming the calculational prediction. With good performance, thermal compatibility and sensitivity characteristics, coupled to the ability to formulate and process TNAZ, this material can be exploited in a broad spectrum of applications. The proposed effort will establish formulation and processing parameters and bring into focus performance aspects for TNAZ-based press-loadable explosives. Formulations that are 100% HE fill, such as binderless TNAZ/NTO, may result in additional energetic output due to overdriving the NTO fill when the TNAZ matrix undergoes detonation. Any formulations investigated during this study can easily be scaled-up and submitted for large-scale performance testing.",

A major difficulty is presented by the fact that the gross signal characteristics of all users are generally equivalent, since each user must satisfy joint communication system signal and protocol requirements. GMF proposes to adapt radar-based sorting algorithms for application to networked communications signal sorting. GMF is presently providing advanced technology in radar signal sorting to the Air Force, and has been recognized by the Air Force as a major contributor and innovator in this area. Radar-based signal sorting techniques of potential interest for this application include those which utlize intrinsic emitter parameters (e.g., PRI), extrinsic emitter parameters (e.g., geometric), and emitter signal intrapulse characteristics. GMF will make use, in this proposed effort, of its prior experience in applications of sorting technology to communications signals.",

        "abstract": "The goal is to produce a sign language telephone providing visual communication to the hearing impaired. Currently their only access to telephone conversation is with typed messages using Telephone for the Deaf and Disable. Sign language is a more appropriate and effective communication medium than is written English. Physical limitations of the existing telephone network preclude transmission of video images in real time. Intelligibility studies of sign language indicate that outline images of the face, arms, and hands convey at least 90% intelligibility, the minimum standard for voice conversations over the telephone. ASEL has a transputer-based personal computer system that converts a video image into such an outline image in real time. Phase I will develop a Sign Language Terminal Board (SLTB) that replaces the transputer network and implements compression/uncompression software to achieve a transmission rate of ten frames per second. The SLTB is built using a set of proprietary integrated circuits under development at the University of Delaware for ASEL. Phase II will combine this chipset into one VLSI chip, enhance the SLTB to contain the compression/uncompression, and develop the sign language telephone as a portable stand-alone unit.",

        "abstract": "Two methods are proposed to reduce GPS range and carrier phase multipath. Both methods are based on the assumption that multipath can be described as a function of elevation and azimuth. The proposed methods determined site-specific \"multipath correction maps\". The first method forms linear combinations of the four GPS observation types to compute range multipath as a function of elevation and azimuth. The advantage of this method is its simplicity and its potential for automatically updating the \"multipath correction maps\". However, the method is based on approximations that must be verified as part of the proposed research. For the second method we will design a \"zero-multipath\" antenna setup. This \"zero-multipath\" antenna, operated on a high, portable tower shall be used in differential mode to monitor multipath at a selected site. This second technique can determine site-specific corrections in real-time or post-processing GPS processing packages. During Phase I we will develop hardware, software, and experimentally test the feasibility of both multipath reduction approaches.",

        "abstract": "We will develop a new technology to address the need for a routine clinical method to preserve tissue for cytochemical assay. The new technology addresses the fact that frozen specimens are preferred for bioactivity, but available methods give inaccurate data. The method LYOPHILM combines lyophilization and FREEZE-TRANSFER to form a method in which thin sections of frozen tissue are thaw-mounted as a pathologically coherent set onto a TISSUE DISC, which is a flexible plastic laminate comprising microporous thin films (windows) coated with a surfactant gel blend. This thin film/surfactant construct permanently bonds tissue and forms a functional interface through which water is transferred into the film, wherein dissolved solutes are immobilized in a cytocoherent pattern. Lyophilization is used to fix and dehydrate tissue non-chemically and to microchannel tissue to normalize regional density differences and enhance target access to reactants. In Phase I, we will validate the method in head to head performance testing with competing methods for storage of frozen breast tissue at above freezing temperatures for two years. Performance will be assessed by quantitative assays of cytocoherent preservation of estrogen receptor and Her-2 immunoreactivity. In Phase II, we will develop the hardware for automated specimen storage and retrieval and develop methods to extend above- freezing storage to five years. The technology is designed for incorporation into an integrated system of automated analytical cytochemistry in which we anticipate polymeric films will replace nonporous glass as tissue substrates.",

        "abstract": "The cleaning chemicals presently used in the production of ultra large scale integrated (ULSI) circuits pose two major problems. The chemicals contain impurity levels that decrease the manufacutring yield of the circuits. In addition, they require extensive treatment for safe disposal. The process described in this proposal addresses regenerated to produce high purity chemicals. The process is applicalbe to the on-site, Point-of-Use regeneration of hydrodlouric acid (HF), hydrochloric acid (HC1) and ammonium hydroxide. Regeneration of these chemicals is accomplished using a combination of distillation and absorption. Distillation is used to separate the chemicals from process generated contaminants. Absorption into high purity deionized (DI) water is used to reconstitute the chemicals. The process is expected to produce chemicals with impurity levels well below those of commercially available chemicals. HF and HC1 cannot be distilled directly from the spent chemical solutions as they form azeotropes with water. A proprietary method is employed to break the azeotrope without decreasing the purity of the recovered chemicals or creating a disposal problem. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: Successful completion of this project is expected to yield a process which increases the manufacturing yield of ULSI circuits and reduces their manufacturing cost. Use of the process will make the US semiconductor industry more competitive with foreign competitive.",

Additionally, it will save money by decreasing the personnel-time and operating room and/or intensive care facility-time required for each zeroing and height levelling step. Specific aims for Phase I are 1) to design and prototype an instrument which, in accordance with U. S. Patent #5,lO3,832, allows for automatic correction for hydrostatic height differences between patient and transducer while providing continuous zero pressure reference to the monitoring system, 2) to ideally configure and breadboard this system to be fully responsive over all physiologic ranges of pressure and required pressure response rates to allow for real-time zeroing and correction of sudden large changes in transducer height, 3) to prepare and develop a version of this prototype which can be easily manufactured, sterile- packaged, and marketed as an adaptable adjunct to existing systems.",

The Interactive Prosody Trainer is a low-cost, microcomputer-based system for interactively teaching speech prosody. Based on a single digital signal processing chip and an easy-to-use graphical interface, this device does two different, interrelated jobs. On output from the host microcomputer, it synthesizes models of utterances from stored linear prediction coefficients and prosodic control parameters. On input, it extracts the fundamental frequency and intensity of the user's productions; the display is used for a comparison with the model as presented. The host microcomputer then visually displays the two productions (i. e., the original model and the user's response) with similarities and differences highlighted for the user's information. Appropriately structured presentations can then lead the user through increasingly precise mimicry of more and more complex computer-generated models.",

        "abstract": "Passengers in the cargo area, cargo box, or bed, of a pickup truck are extremely vulnerable to death and injury caused, not only by crashes and sudden maneuvers, but often due to normal driving responses over off-road terrain. There are approximately 10,000 pickup trucks involved in fatal crashes each year accounting for over 5,000 deaths to occupants of the pickups, both in the cab and in the cargo area. Even more serious injuries, with enormous societal costs, are caused by accidents involving people carried in the cargo areas. There is an immediate need for an occupant protection system designed for use in the cargo area of pickup trucks. Only one state has a law prohibiting transporting people in the cargo area of a truck, 16 have laws that address the problem, and 33 have no such laws. The 1990 Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS) states that registered light truck vehicles have increased by 89 percent and fatalities to occupants of light trucks have increased 77 percent since 1975. The development of after market occupant restraint systems utilizing state-of-the-art materials and proven harness system technology for use in the cargo area of pickup trucks is proposed. The ultimate purpose is to request funding to perform research, develop, test, and evaluate, toward bringing to market, 2 innovative systems for a solution to these problems.",

However, the unique problems of the protection of low birth weight (LBW) and physically fragile infant occupants in automobile crashes has not been specifically addressed by either the government or industry. Increasing numbers of LBW infants are released annually from hospitals. Many of these infants require apnea monitors and are in danger of respiratory compromise when placed in the semi-reclined position. There is an immediate need for a car bed for this infant population to allow them to be transported in the prone of supine position. During a previous SBIR Phase I contract with the Department of Transportation (DOT), we demonstrated the feasibility of the development of a car bed to fulfill this need. Additionally, this car bed provides the unique capability of securing the equipment necessary for physiological monitoring of apneic infants while it is in use in the vehicle. The ultimate purpose is to further develop, test and evaluate this innovative device to bring it into the market place.",

The prototype will consist of a hypermedia stack on high-priority topic(s), identified through a review of effective tobacco prevention curricula. It will be evaluated through observation and focus groups with students. The product is technologically innovative because it uses a new computer-based learning strategy to extend the effectiveness of proven curricula.

This requires both federal regulatory agencies and industry to explore new rapid and cost-effective methods for assessing health hazards and environmental effects of chemicals, especially since the resources are scarce and risk assessment is becoming a social priority. The research is directed at the development of computer-assisted methods for predictive toxicology. Specifically, during Phase I, cross-validated structure-toxicity models will be developed for confident prediction of the carcinogenic potential of untested chemicals. In order to better understand the models and predictions therefrom, not only the transport, electronic, and steric attributes of molecular structure, but also the results form certain short-term toxicological studies along with organ-specific toxicity data will be used as descriptor variables. Both parametric statistical and supervised artificial intelligence techniques will be employed to explore non-linear relationships between these descriptors and as complex a phenomenon as carcinogenesis. The success of Phase I will provide impetus to (1) extend the technique to other neoplastic and non-neoplastic toxic endpoints, and (2) automate the model building and model installation techniques. This would result in an artificial intelligence package for predicting a wide toxicity profile of untested chemicals.",

        "abstract": "The need for efficacious methods for surgical education is very important since new techniques of laparoscopic surgery are difficult to master. Several studies have indicated that the complication rates of laparoscopic surgery and conversion rates of laparoscopic to an open procedure are significantly reduced after a surgeon has performed approximately 15 procedures. The need for training is increasingly important as more complex procedures are performed laparoscopically. Surgical education has been accomplished in the past by a combination of observation, peer teaching, and practice on cadavers and animals. New technology, referred to as 'virtual reality, ' has already been employed in the airline industry and can likewise provide enriched educational experiences for physicians. To date, barriers involving the complexity and cost of modeling/simulating surgical procedures have precluded the use of this technology in medicine. We have aggressively pursued the design of virtual reality systems for medical education. Our staff pioneered the first Apple Macintosh-based virtual reality surgical simulation and is equipped with a Silicon Graphics, Inc. Reality Engine-based graphics super-computer. Our goal is to produce complete VR-based simulations at a reasonable price; thurs, this will allow widespread distribution of these simulations to both institutions and individual physicians.",

        "abstract": "The long-term goal is a gateway to computerized medical data that will be attractive to health care professionals. Even though databases of medical knowledge and patient data are available, many health care professionals do not use such systems for a number of reasons: lack of time to sit at a terminal, disinclination to be a typist, frustration with the procedures, and the belief that an intermediary should deal with databases. A potential solution is a mobile pen-and-tablet with wireless interactive communications and with data access procedures that are easy and comfortable. To achieve this goal, the project will address both technical questions and user interface issues. While the technology is generally available, there are still some significant problems, and the potential for improving the user interface has only begun to be explored. During Phase I, the technical limits will be examined by a combination of assembling a working prototype and researching the current and near- term developments in the industry. The user interface issues will be probed by consulting potential users, developing knowledge-based and graphical enhancements to the basic interface, and soliciting evaluations from health care professionals, thus providing a solid foundation for Phase II development.",

        "abstract": "For signal level control in microwave systems, attenuators are normally designed to improve logarithmic level variation (i.e. in dBs) in response to a control signal. For some level control applications, the logarithmic control is inadequate to provide the fine resolution needed at low attenuation levels. Examples of such requirements include: weighted loading of antenna arrays, alignment of mono-pulse receivers, antenna nulling, and digital modulation (e.g. QAM) for communications. In most of these applications, it is highly desirable to have independent means of control for amplitude and phase. This proposal describes several alternate circuit designs to attain the attenuation/level control requirements, and outlines an approach to select the optimum design for MMIC implementation. Design options include: active gain controlled amplifiers vs. attenuators, and digital vs. analog control of attenuation/gain. Methods of phase compensation and linearization, applicable to various design options, are also presented to show that the level control function can be accomplished with negligible phase variations. Hittite proposes to implement an MMIC design of the attenuator/level control circuit. The MMIC design will lead to miniaturization and provide the flexibility of integrating additional microwave circuit functions on-chip with the attenuator. Hittite also proposes a laboratory demonstration of the selected approach using available assets.",

        "abstract": "In 1827 mathematician August Mobius introduced a predessor to liner algebra which he called the barycentric calculus. In Mobius scheme, an arbitrary vector x in n-dimensional Euclidean space is expressed as the center of mass (or barycenter) of N point masses located at positions w1, w2,...,wN, and having masses m1, m2,...,mN, respectively (i.e., x = summation of (mk)(wk) from k = 1 to N, where the summation of (mk) = 1 from k = 1 to N. In this project we shall explore the use of an adaptive neural network technique for selecting nearly orthogonal point mass positions embedded within a statistical population of data block vectors to dramatically improve the performance of vector quantization data compression systems for communications. The idea is to transmit not only the nearest matching codebook vector, but a small set of qualified codebook vectors and their corresponding masses. In this way the original data vector can be accurately reconstructed as the barycenter of these masses with much less error and much igher compression than fixed transform (e.g., JPEG), vector quantization, eigenimage, and principal componant analysis approaches. A modest computational burden and real-time operation are inherent in the method, unlike fractal compression. The goal of Phase I will be to demonstrate 40:1 compression of video images with an RMS pixel value distortion of less than 10% in the decompressed imagery. In Phase II, the goal will be 100:1 compression with an RMS error level below 5%.",

Teh VULCAN linear motor concept principle has been proven in hardware applications involving Stirling cycle refrigerators and electrical generators. The VULCAN linear motor offers significant advantages over the moving coil and other types commonly used in cryocoolers. Among these are: (1) higher conversion efficiency; (2) very low EMI; (3) total eliminatio of contaminant out-gassign materials from the working fluid; (4) high specific power; (5) compact size; (6) removal of heat generating components from the working fluid; (7) elimination of flexing electrical contact and pressure vesse. feed-throughs. The proposed effort will consider a rangeof cryocooler applications of interest to DOD, and identify a target for which the VULCAN motor concept can offer the greatest benefit over other technologies. The Phase I includes the design and performance analysis of two versions of the VULCAN motor for the targeted application, a Fundamental and and Advanced Features unit. Prototypes fo these two designs will then be built, tested and evaluated in Phase II.",

The information in this proposal is an extension of that earlier work and it shows that one pass thinning of GaAs has a high probability of succeeding. However, diamond turning machines (DTM) in general must be modified before they can achieve high quality thickness control and parallelity under competitive production conditions. The modifications necessary to convert and industry standard DTM (Moore Special tools m-18 AG) into a competitive backside thinning machine is conceptually provided. Phase I delivers one thinned GaAs wafer (100 micron thick) with a full physical and electronic characterization.

        "abstract": "The Aeroballistic Range Facility (ARF) at Eglin Air Force Base needs to improve the operational and ballistic characteristics of launchers used in testing aerodynamic configurations in its instrumented range. A high piezometric efficiency is required to reduce acceleration loads exerted on fragile projectiles. It is also desirable to reduce or eliminate shocks in the light gas. A longer barrel also would be beneficial. The launchers are constrained to a total length of approximately 30 ft. The Wave Gun is an ideal candidate for this application in that its inherent characteristics match the ARF requirements. It provides several propulsion pulses to the projectile as it accelerates down the barrel, which significantly increases piezometric efficiency. It employs a short pump tube, allowing for a longer barrel in the confined space available at ARF. The consumables can be incorporated into cartridges, facilitating turnaround. Additional experience with single-shot Wave Gun can lead to improved understanding of its potential for weaponization. A Phase I SBIR program is proposed that will address the specific requirements of ARF, perform interior ballistic calculations with the AIBAL code which was developed and proven for Wave Gun performance analysis, and produce a design optimized for ARF. The potential utility of existing Wave Gun hardware will be evaluated as part of this effort.",

        "abstract": "Intelligent Reasoning Systems (IRS) is developing an integrated active vision system (AVS) based on design principles derived from experimental analysis of mammalian visual systems. The AVS design is based on a asynchronous analog encoding of location and motion data, and a custom VLSI Hybrid Temporal Processing Element (HTPE) developed by and available solely to IRS (patent pending). The HTPE can operate on analog data at frequencies in excess of 100 MHz, allowing rapid oversampling methods to be used for resolution enhancement, motion detection, and multiple-template matching. HTPEs have low device count and power dissipation, and can be fabricated in small layout areas. The AVS is intended for eventual on-hoard application in robots, intelligent machine tools, and other autonomous sensory-motor systems that require visible, IR, or similar input. The initid step in visual processing is the collection of data from the primary sensor. The goal of this Phase I proposal is to evaluate the feasibility of a silicon retina for the AVS based on the HTPE, and to investigate various methods for achieving sub-pixel resolution and enhanced motion sensitivity with such a retina.. -",

        "abstract": "The ability of tumor cells to become resistant to a variety of chemotherapeutic agents is a major unsolved problem in clinical oncology. Research in this area has provided strong evidence that the overexpression of a single gene (MDR1), which encodes a membrane-bound glycoprotein, contributes to the resistance of a large proportion of drug-resistant tumors present in the clinic. This glycoprotein (Pgp) actively transports a variety of chemotherapeu- tic agents out of the cell; thereby, this activity conveys resistance. We will regulate the expression of the MDR1 gene using antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (later phosphorothioates) targeted to MDR1 mRNA. We will initially employ a transgenic cell system wherein the cloned human MDR1 gene is overexpressed in NIH3T3 cells. Restora- tion of drug sensitivity in these cells provides a rapid and effective screen for specific inhibitors of MDR1 gene expression and the gene product. We will confirm the effectiveness of anti sense sequences identified using this screen by characterizing their effects on Pgp activity at a functional and molecular level. Lastly, we will determine the ability of antisense sequences to sensitize human tumor cells resistant to chemotherapeutic agents. The results of these studies will contribute to the development of new treatment modalities effective in overcoming multidrug resistance in human cancer.",

A leading source of these problems has been the use of antibodies derived from mouse rather than human sources.While it has long been felt that human antibodies would be superior therapeutic agents, the generation of human MAbs has been problematic because a suitable fusion partner has not been generated. Such a fusion partner would yield stable clones with high antibody production following fusion and would not express its endogenous immunoglobulin genes. The goal is to construct a superior fusion partner. The starting cell line has previously been demonstrated to give excellent fusion yields, but secretes antibody prior to fusion.This line will be genetically engineered to disrupt its active immunoglobulin genes, thereby, eliminating antibody production.

The carbon tubing is derived from polyimide tubing. The radial fiber structure is created by electrostatic flocking. Coatings to block hydrogen permeation and to protect against erosion are applied by chemical vapor deposition. The proposed process is suited for various gauges of tubing and for various curvatures. The flocked carbon tubing may be integrated with carbon fiber preforms and processed to form an actively cooled carbon-carbon structural component for use with hot pressurized hydrogen. Phase 1 effort will focus on materials processing. We will investigate the carbonization of selected precursors, fiber flocking methods, and cvd coatings. Electron microscopy will be used to inspect the tubing wall and fiber attachment. Sections of flocked carbon tubing will be fabricated for thermal cycling, and measurements of permeation and the rate of erosion in hot hydrogen. Preliminary thermal analysis will model carbon-carbon heat exchanger structures with the new tubing to investigate design trades and assess the overall performance. A draft design for a Phase 2 prototype heat exchanger panel will be prepared. Phase 2 would continue process development, leading to fabrication of a prototype heat exchanger panel to be tested under conditions relevant to the NASP leading edge application.",

HYPRES proposes a promising new way to realize a digital beamformer based on true time delay elements and capable of ultra-wide bandwidth operation combined with arbitrarily large array size by using recently developed superconducting RSFQ digital technology. HYPRES has demonstrated the key elements required for a digital system, the operation of an 8-bit 2OGS/s ADC capable of digitizing 1-l8GHz input signals and superconducting logic capable of pipelined arithmetic functions at clock rates in excess of 2OGHz. The digital wideband beamforming system proposed is required to perform the delay, multiply and sum functions necessary to implement the beamforming algorithm. The Phase l objective is to demonstrate the high-speed operation of the critical components of an extendible wideband digital beamforming system. Toward this goal, HYPRES will implement and test a 64-bit Variable-Length Shift Register and a Parallel Multiplier design operating at 10 to 2OGHz. HYPRES proposes in Phase II to develop a digital wideband Beamforming system. The proposed system would use a wideband ADC operating at up to 2OGS/s for a 1OGHz instantaneous bandwidth baseband. The system would use multiple copies of a single IC with a fast ADC and beamforming section. These ICs would be cascadable to any size array. For implementation of large spatial arrays, the IC would have an optical input, this would allow for many widely separated antennae. The IC would be 1cm x 1cm and dissipate less than IOOmW, a complete 64 channel beamforming front-end system could be implemented on a single 6\" substrate.",

        "abstract": "Current Electronic Warfare (EW) systems are limited to digital processing at a baseband of typically less than 100MHz, restricted by 500MS/s Analog to Digital Convertors (ADC) and l00MS/s Digital Signal Processors. HYPRES proposes to develop the key components to allow the implementation of a digital EW system with a l0GHz instantaneous bandwidth baseband. This design would replace the analog components, except for an optional first level of downconversion, with an all digital system. HYPRES has demonstrated the key elements required for a digital EW system, the operation of an 8-bit 20GS/s ADC capable of digitizing 1-18GHz input signals and superconducting logic capable of pipelined arithmetic functions at clock rates in excess of 20GHz. Several EW system architecture's have been analyzed, and their analog architecture's have been translated to a digital implementation. The advantages of digital processing are significant; processing of an 10GHz instantaneous bandwidth for interception of spread spectrum and ultra-wideband signals, signal to noise ratio does not degrade through consecutive signal processing of the signal data stream, and SNR can be enhanced by rejection of out-of-band noise. This allows for post acquisition trade-off of bandwidth for resolution. HYPRES proposes in Phase I to design, fabricate and test the key digital element required by DSP algorithms, the multiplier accumulator (MAC). Using a serial design, a multiply accumulate requires only 33 Carry Save Adders, internally operating at 33GHz, that perform the multiply accumlate operation at l GHz. Phase II will develop a complete real-time spectrum channelizer suitable for insertion into an AN/ALR-56M from LORAL. The design consists of an 8-bit ADC operating at 1GS/s and a parallel 16-pt complex FET operating at 500MS/s.",

THESE OSCILLATORS ARE BASED ON A NOVEL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE JOSEPHSON EFFECT IN NIOBIUM SUPERCONDUCTING INTEGRATED CIRCUITS: THE QUASIOPTICAL JOSEPHSON OSCILLATOR (QJO). THE QJO WILL RADIATE COHERENTLY INTHE SUBMILLIMETER RANGE WHEN LOW VOLTAGE DC POWER IS APPLIED TO IT, JUST AS THE LASER DIODE OPERATES IN THE INFRARED AND OPTICAL RANGE. THE QJO WILL HAVE A FEW OCTAVES OF FREQUENCY TUNING AVAILABLE BY CHANGING THE DC VOLTAGE APPLIED. THE EFFORT WE PROPOSE IS IN COLLABORATION WITH PROFESSOR WENGLER OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER. WENGLER'S NOVEL DESIGN INVOLVES A 2-DIMENTIONAL ARRAY OF JOSEPHSON JUNCTIONS WITH THE GENERATED POWER RADIATED THROUGH DIPOLE ANTENNAS. SUBMILLIMETER SOURCES CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TEND TO BE VERY LOW POWER WITH LIMITED TUNING, OR REQUIRE KILOVOLT POWER SUPPLIES.

        "abstract": "Signal information can be transmitted over an optical fiber by encoding the signal as a frequency or phase modulated lightwave carrier. This approach eliminates the need for any light amplification if an adequately sensitive phase demodulator coupled to an analog-to-digital converter is used at the receiving end. A digital output is thus readily obtained. Phase modulation offers several advantages over intensity modulation: wider bandwideth, higher sensitivity, and wider dynamic range. The phase modulation can be produced by electro-optic materials without the need for any active devices. The signal carrier is mixed down and converted into an electrical signal by a fast PIN diode. The intermediate frequency (IF) is greater than the signal bandwidth and less than the diode cutt-off, typically 5-50 GHz. The signal information exists as the frequency or phase variation of the IF. The IF frequency must be measured and converted to digital data at twice the signal bandwidth, up to 10 GS/s. HYPRES proposes a complete digital system to measure the IF signal content. The system detects the time-of-arrival of the zero-crossings of the IF. A very high sensitivity superconducting flux quantizer, already demonstrated by HYPRES, is used for this measurement. The quantizer is followed by a 100 GHz sampling system consisting of an accumulator and averager. The combined system is capable of 1 ps resolution in the progressive phase acquisition, translating into a 20 HGz IF base interval, and correspoding to a signal bandwidth of 5 GHz with 6.7 bits of resolution. For a 0.5 GHz signal bandwidth, the signal resolution will be 10 bits. In Phase I, HYPRES will demonstrate the feasibility of the approach by generating and detecting the zero-crossing frequency of an optical signal. In Phase II, the complete link will be implemented with a signal bandwidth of 5 GHz.",

A NOVEL READOUT CIRCUIT THAT ACCOMPLISHES THE SAME FUNCTION WHILE ELIMINATING THE AMPLIFIERS AND SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVING THE POWER DISSIPATION AND DENSITY IS THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT.

Suitable indexing of these images will make retrieval rapid, and we will research ways to enable CD-ROM users to download these data to existing chromatogram analysis software to perform automated analyses. This CD-ROM will be designed to address 2 problems associated with research activities in chromatography: accessing appropriate and reliable chromatograms quickly and in using those reference chromatograms to make computations. In general, chromatography is a family of techniques used to separate/purify the components of chemical mixtures by taking advantage of the different transport properties of those chemicals in some medium. Applications of chromatography include analytical studies as well as purifica- tion/production. Chromatography is more like an art than a science; the choice of a \"medium\" and the associated conditions (temperature, pressure, column length, etc.) is usually based on precedent rather than on a calculation from first principles. However, locating reliable and complete precedents in journals is not easy. Even when one has a complete specification of precedent, an investigator must usually extrapolate from that condition to what he/she can do. The reasons for this are the mixture to be separated is somewhat different from the published case, or the separation equipment that is available is somewhat different, or because the performance required is different. This extrapolation from published cases is usually done by \"eyeballing\" the available chromatograms, a technique allowing room for improvement.",

Since oncology patients are highly representative of persons with chronic illnesses who require care at multiple health care facilities and concomitant record sharing, we will use their records as the model employed in prototyping. Though some patient data are now in electronic form and though it appears evident that electronic storage will accelerate, the infrastructure of vocabulary, message, rule, format, content and health care protocol standards is not in place to facilitate electronic patient record data interchange. We have described a mechanism for ameliorating that problem. It describes the development of an Electronic Patient Record Interchange (EPRI) mechanism, a structure to be used for communication of patient clinical data among Computer-based Patient Record (CPR) systems. The structure is flexible and will accommodate standards as they evolve.

The two images are combined by a neighborhood processing algorithm into a single image which spans the wide intrascene dynamic range.

        "abstract": "DUCTILE NIOBIUM TITANIUM (NBTI) ALLOY CONTINUES TO BE THE CHOICE MATERIAL FOR MOST OF THE LARGE SCALE SUPERCONDUCTIVITY DEVICES. THE PRESENT PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY FOR NBTI SUPERCONDUCTORS INVOLVES WORKING THE COMPOSITE IN SEVERAL STAGES WITH INTERMEDIATE HEAT TREATMENTS TO SUCCESSIVELY INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF ALPHA TITANIUM PRECIPITATE. THE EFFECT OF THE COMPLEX SET OF POSSIBLE HEAT TREATMENT CONDITIONS IS REASONABLY WELL UNDERSTOOD. IT IS GENERALLY TRUE THAT A HIGH CURRENT DENSITY (JC) CAN BE ACHIEVED BY INCREASING THE NUMBER AND LENGTH OF HEAT TREATMENTS. HOWEVER, STRAIN SPACE AVAILABLE FOR MULTIFILAMENT COMPOSITES AFTER THE LAST HOT EXTRUSIN IS SMALL, LIMITING THE NUMBER OF HEAT TREATMENTS. FURTHERMORE, THE INCREASED NUMBER OF HEAT TREATMENTS ADDS PROCESSING COST AND TIME. IT HAS ALSO BEEN OBSERVED THROUGH MICROSCOPY THAT THE COLD-WORK/HEAT TREATMENT CYCLES RESULT IN A NON-UNIFORM DEFORMATION OF NBTI GRAIN STRUCTURE WHICH IN TURN LEADS TO UNEVEN PRECIPITATION OF ALPHA PHASE WITHIN THE NBTI BETA GRAIN STRUCTURE. THIS PROJECT WILL INVESTIGATE A PROCESSING CONCEPT THAT IS NOVEL TO THE NBTI TECHNOLOGY. BASED ON THERMO-MECHANICAL PROCESSING (TMP), IT HAS THE POTENTIAL OF ACHIEVING A MORE UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION OF PRECIPITATES IN HIGHER VOLUMES AND, THEREFORE, HIGHER JC THAN THE CONVENTIONAL COLD-WORK/HEAT TREATMENTS ARE CAPABLE OF. THE PHASE I PROJECT WILL INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY OF THE TMP APPROACH USING RUDIMENTARY MONOFILAMENT AND MULTIFILAMENTARY COMPOSITES, AND WILL EVALUATE THE RESULTANT MICROSTRUCTURE AND SUPERCONDUCTING PROPERTIES. IF PROVEN SUCCESSFUL THE TMP WILL REPLACE MOST IF NOT ALL IN-PROCESS LONG-TERM HEAT TREATMENTS AND WILL OFFER AN ECONOMICAL AND HIGH RATE PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY.",

        "abstract": "Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has emerged as an extremely important diagnostic imaging modality. Partly as a result of cost-containment pressures, there has been a trend towards less expensive lower-field MR systems which have an inherently lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), manifested in lower \"image quality\" and longer scan times. It is widely known that, at lower fields, SNR can be improved by cooling the receiving coil, thereby, reducing resistive losses. Theoretically, superconductors can reduce these losses to zero, and the advent of high-temperature superconductors (HTS) has made this a more practical proposition. Both cooled copper and high-temperature superconductors require a cryogenic subsystem to reduce the temperature of the conductor, while maintaining the surface of the device (which is in close proximity to the patient) at approximately room temperature. HTS coils will be fabricated, and a cryogenic subsystem will be designed: (i) to determine the suitability of specific HTS materials and manufacturing methods for this application, and (ii) to develop cryo-cooled receiver coil packaging which is at once easy to use, safe, reliable, and cost-effective. Design of initial coils will be oriented towards a very high resolution skin imaging application.",

Collecting and analyzing interaction process data is difficult, time consuming, and expensive. Reliability and reproducibility are difficult to establish and maintain. Phase I will test several alternative machine learning strategies on health care practitioner - patient interaction data. We will assess the percent of events which can be automatically coded, the number of cases required for training, and the utility of alternative learning strategies. In Phase II the most promising strategies will be incorporated into a computer program for interacting coding. Automated interaction coding with acceptable rates of accuracy could drastically reduce the cost and time required for interaction analysis, improve reliability, enhance scientific accountability, and permit new applications in research and training. For research it could permit the analysis of far larger quantities of interaction data, permitting interaction studies to examine a broader range of variables and employ more sophisticated analyses. Coupled with advances in speech recognition it could permit real-time interpretation and advice for teachers, physicians, police, and other professions. In a service-oriented economy with increasing professionalization of many service providers, automated coding of interaction processes could provide a broad range of intelligent computer assistants to improve interaction skills.",

This project hypothesizes that increased usage of electronic cancer information can be achieved through improved ease-of-use and reduced cost. This will be tested by collecting NCI's electronic information in the Online Cancer Information Retrieval and Access Service (OCIRAS), which will be distributed (without additional user charges) over U. S. HealthLink, a comprehensive, nationwide electronic medical information network. The initial OCIRAS service will then be enhanced by making it more easily searchable. Next OCIRAS will be included in the U. S. HealthLink Clipping Service, which provides for continuous automatic updates on subjects chosen by each subscriber. Usage data will be collected from a test population of at least 1,000 subscribers after initial release, after the searching enhancements, and after inclusion in the clipping service to assess the effect of these changes on usage. The results of this study will then be used to design a Phase II IEI project that will expand and revise OCIRAS and make it available to a larger audience.",

It is widely believed that the targeted delivery of cytotoxic effector molecules to the tumor tissue could greatly improve the anticancer effect. The first step in developing this type of therapy for the treatment of breast cancer is the identification of targeting vehicles, such as monoclonal antibodies which bind specifically to breast tumor tissue. Previous work has identified several antigens expressed on breast tumors but none of these are ideally suited as targets for immunotoxins. If the immunoconjugate therapy is to be effective, it is of absolute importance that the antigen is cell specific, expressed on the surface of the cell and is not shed into the sera. We propose a novel method that will lead to the identification of breast tumor specific cell surface antigens. Subtractive hybridization has been used successfully to identify differentially expressed genes, and we will apply this methodology to create a cDNA library that is highly enriched in sequences that encode breast tumor specific antigens. Expression of this library in a murine cell line will create a novel set of antigens that should upon immunization lead to antibodies with the desired breast tumor restricted specificity.",

        "abstract": "Our goal is to engineer and express, in mammalian cells, a whole antibody/ricin immunotoxin with therapeutic qualities that exceed bacterially-produced recombinant immunotoxins. Ricin is a plant toxin comprised of a non-toxic B-chain that attaches the toxin to cell surfaces and facilitates penetration of cell membranes by the toxic A- chain, an N-glycosidase that catalytically inactivates mammalian ribosomes. The two-chain subunit structure of ricin presents the unique opportunity to express the non-toxic B-chain as a fusion protein with a full length heavy chain of an antibody in a mammalian cell such as a non- secreting myeloma. Once the Ig/B-chain fusion hybrid is purified, it can be re-associated with ricin A-chain to form a recombinant immunotoxin that can be used to treat diseases of clonogenic origin. Currently, recombinant immunotoxins are made by fusion of bacterial toxins to antibody fragments, which can only be produced in bacteria. These single-chain toxins have very brief half-lives in vivo and pre-existing antibodies to toxins like Pseudomonas exotoxin and diphtheria toxin preclude their use in some patients. A recombinant ricin immunotoxin expressed in myeloma employs whole Ig, which has a long serum half-life (weeks) that could produce increased therapeutic efficacy in patients. A recombinant ricin immunotoxin that incorporates whole antibody has therapeutic potential in the treatment of cancer, graft vs host disease, transplant rejection, auto-immune disease and allergies.",

        "abstract": "Cancer patients are usually tolerant to the antigens expressed on tumor cells. Triggering an active immune response by the patients to tumor-associated antigens represents one of the most promising prospects in cancer therapy. In this project, we will perform a preclinical study of the anti-idiotype approach to trigger an active immune response against CEA. Certain anti-idiotypic antibodies directed against the variable regions of antibodies specific for a given antigen can mimic (i. e., bear the internal image of) this antigen. In several experimental systems, immunization with anti-idiotypic antibodies elicited specific immunity in lieu of the original antigen. Immunization with anti-idiotype antibodies as surrogate antigens is a promising approach to trigger immunity to tolerized antigens such as tumor antigens. They have already generated baboon polyclonal and rat monoclonal anti-idiotype antibodies that antigenically mimic CEA. In this project, they will assess whether these anti-idiotype antibodies can function as surrogate antigens in hamsters. Hamsters have been chosen since they are the only known non-immunodeficient animal species in which human CEA-producing tumors may grow. Hamsters represent a unique model to test whether active anti-idiotype immunization can protect against tumor growth. This Phase I study will represent the basis for more extensive preclinical and clinical studies in Phase II.",

Reverse transcribed RNA from the MA5-expressing murine hybridoma will be amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Ig variable heavy and light chain-specific primers, and cloning and sequencing. Selection of the human framework regions (FRs) will then be based on sequence similarities to the mouse FRs, and the mouse complementarily-determining regions (CDRs) and their supporting human FRs will be modeled. Synthesis of the variable domains will be proceeded by PCR amplification of long, overlapping synthetic DNA oligomers encoding the designed sequences and these constructs are completed by ligation into expression vectors bearing human heavy (IgG1) and light chain (k) constant domains. After transfection, antibody expression will be monitored and compared to the holomurine MAb with regard to antigen recognition/binding. Phase II studies will compare the humanized and murine MAbs for targeting tumors in breast cancer patients.",

Comparing IgG-SH, F(ab')2-SH and Fab'-SH, it is expected that a F(ab')2-SH fragment will have fast enough clearance from circulation to permit earlier imaging than a comparably radiolabeled IgG-SH, while having less renal uptake than a comparably labeled Fab'-SH fragment. Previously, direct labeling of F(ab')2-SH was problematic in that a 50:50 mixture of Tc-99m-F(ab')2 and Tc99m-Fab' would result due to the presence of a small amount of monovalent fragment. We have a novel technique of pre.reducing intact IgG to break non-hinge region disulfide bonds prior to digestion of antibody. The resulting, pure F(ab')2-SH is capable of quantitative incorporation of technetium-99m, in the same manner as IgG-SH and Fab'-SH, are currently labeled to yield quantitatively Tc-99m-F(ab')2. We will extend the technique to different antibodies targeted against different cancers, and ultimately use humanized F(ab')2-SH fragments. In phase l research, we will prove the superiority of Tc99m-F(ab')2 over Tc-99m- Fab' and Tc-99m-IgG as an early time-point radioimmunoimaging agent; if successful, produce clinically usable kits at the conclusion of the Phase II period.",

A strategy that would make possible the development of galanin agonists and antagonists that are bioavailable in the brain would require the design of peptidominetic agents--mimics of galanin that are themselves non-peptides. Such compounds would have the lipid solubility required for penetration of the blood-brain barrier. Success in peptidominetic design, especially using computational chemistry, depends on an accurate method for prediction the three dimensional structure, both steric and electronic, of the parent peptide and also of the analogs and peptidomimetic design, since no three dimensional chemical information is readily derived from such structures. This is the case with design and synthesis of constrained peptides based on the computation of an accurate three dimensional structure for galanin. These constrained peptides represent three dimensional templates for the design, synthesis and testing of the peptidomimetics in Phase II. Algorithms to do this have been developed in our laboratories.",

Each technique has its associated shortcoming. With the use of laser induced volumetric heating of tissue, the measurement of treatment temperatures is even more difficult. High light intensities in the area of treatment complicate the placement and accuracy of measurement devices. This effort addresses two complimentary techniques for the measurement of temperatures around an interstitial laser power applicator with emphases on simplicity, size, accuracy, and economy. The techniques to be investigated are miniature thermistors and an all optical method based on temperature dependent change of absorption.

THE VALVELESS SOLID DIVERT CONCEPT INTEGRATES AN APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALLY-IGNITABLE SOLID PROPELLANT GRAINS, SIZED TO PROVIDE THE MINIMUM IMPULSE BITS NEEDED TO ASSURE TARGET HIT-TO-KILL, INTO TWO DOUBLE-ENDED CHAMBERS (OR \"MODULES\") TO PROVIDE PLUS AND MINUS DIVERT CONTROL ALONG THE DESIRED TWO DIVERT AXES. APPLICATION OF DIVERT THRUST IS CONTROLLED BY ELECTRONICALLY-ACTIVATED IGNITERS INSTEAD OF EXPENSIVE AND OFTEN UNRELIABLE HOT-GAS VALVES. THE PROPOSED VSD SUBSYSTEM CAN BE PRODUCED RAPIDLY AT A FRACTION OF THE COST OF CURRENT SOLID PROPELLANT DIVERT CONTROL SUBSYSTEMS.",

        "abstract": "This project is based on a novel computer graphics technology for man/machine interfaces that relies on machine learning techniques, neural-like networks, and object recognition IU techniques. The key idea is to use a few \"example\" views of an object or person, to teach the computer to generate other views, under user control. WIth our technology we will develop an interactive (multimedia) interface that will enable the computer to communicate with the user with facial expressions and possibly synthesized speech. The technology advance is based on developments at M.I.T. of a new technique for learning from examples (the \"HyperBF network\"), partly under DARPA and ONR funding, and to its specific application to computer graphics and animation (Poggio and Brunelli, Patent Application No. 7-819767 and Poggio and Librande, MIT Case No. 5831S). The technology is closely related to work at MIT in Professor Poggio's group on object recognition, which combines classicial computer vision and networks for learning. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: The main applications of the technology are to create new man/machine interfaces and enhance the images found in electronic documents, such as computer manuals and reference materials. Other applications that will benefit from this technology are virtual reaility simulations, interactive multimedia and very-high compression teleconferencing.",

        "abstract": "The long-term goal is to develop a commercial computer- based telecommunications system for monitoring ambulatory patients with serious and complex chronic illnesses. The goal is to adapt the Telephone-Linked Communications (TLC) system to diabetes mellitus; this technology is a prototype for multi-system chronic illnesses that require intense patient monitoring and education with emphasis on patient self-monitoring and self-care. The work is a natural outgrowth of a previous, simpler use of the TLC technology to monitor hypertensive patients. Use of the system was associated with significant reduction in blood pressure in a randomized clinical trial and acceptance of the technology by both patients and physicians. The work also builds upon very recent work in developing and implementing a simple application for diabetes patients in an HMO setting. In this Phase I proposal, the Diabetes Telephone Monitoring System will be developed and tested. The system will converse regularly with Type I diabetic patients in their homes. It will ask questions to determine the patient's blood glucose values, use of insulin, intercurrent episodes of hypoglycemia and other significant clinical events, knowledge of diabetic self-care standards, and performance of self-care procedures. In response to patient entries, the system will provide feedback to fill knowledge gaps and improve self-care behavior. The physicians and nurses taking care of the patient will receive regular reports designed to help them monitor clinical status and introduce changes in patient management. Patients will be sent monthly reports to show them how they are doing and to motivate them to adhere to diabetic self-care standards. To carry out conversations, the diabetes system will use computer-controlled speech generation. The patients will communicate by pressing keys on a standard touch-tone telephone. The aims of Phase I include: (1) specification of the conversation content and printed report design, (2) programming modifications of the TLC technology to support the design requirements, (3) implementation of a test version of the diabetes system, and (4) preliminary feasibility testing of the system and its commercial viability by focus groups of diabetologists and diabetes nurses.",

        "abstract": "Many cancer cells are immunogenic, but somehow fail to stimulate the immune system. Transfecting tumor cells with allogeneic MHC class I genes stimulates the immune system to both the alloantigen and the tumor specific antigen on the tumor cells, so the immune system can destroy parental, nontransfected tumor cells. Thus, tumor allogenization represents an approach to tumor immunotherapy, whereby, the host immune system may be stimulated to break tolerance against the tumor. An engineered class I gene called DC was constructed by engineering 2 cysteines into the alpha 1 domain of the Kb gene, making it appear more stable and immunogenic. DC-transfected tumor cells can stimulate long- term, systemic immunity against nontransfected tumor cells. DC is allogeneic in C57BL/6 mice from which it was derived, indicating that it will be allogeneic in all strains of mice and is capable of allogenizing all tumors from all strains of mice. Thus, in a clinical situation, DC can be a single off the shelf reagent for the allogenization of tumor cells and immunotherapy of tumors. We will define the conditions for maximum immunological expression of DC and endogenous class I for use in tumor immunotherapy.",

However, several technological problems have to be solved before a full realization of their potential. The principal challenge is the stability of the solid polymer electrolytes (SPE). Currently, all lithium-SPE systems exhibit increasing cell impedence with cycles, leading to loss of capacity and poor cycle life. While the exact nature of the interfacial behavior is not yet well understood, it is clear that a proper understanding and elimination of the interfacial impedance problem is paramount to the development of long cycle-life lithium batteries. We propose an attempt to synthesize some truly ionic, lithium conducting polymers and the construction and study of all solid-state LixC6/SPE/Mn2O4 systems. A well characterized PEO system as control will be compared to the new electrolyte systems with rspect to conductivity and cell performance.

Composites will be prepared from various electronically conductive materials and several separators, such as microporous films and ion-exchange membranes. These will be tested with O2 and an alternative anode depolarizer to determine cell voltage, current efficiency and power requirements. Some of the advantages anticipated over conventional methods are expected to include lower power consumption at higher rates of O2 production and more compact, lighter weight devices with longer useful life and little maintenance.

The need for new disposal technology has been heightened by discovery of ordnance compounds in soils and groundwaters at military sites across the United States. To prevent further contamination from improperly stored munitions wastes and industrial waste streams, and to remediate environments already contaminated by ordnance compounds, improved treatment processes must be developed for nitro-substituted chemicals. Recent work at the University of Idaho by the founders of Innovative BioSystems, Incorporated (IBS) has shown complete degradation of TNT and RDX to innocuous products under strictly anaerobic conditions. Conditions for fermentative degradation of TNT and RDX have been optimized using anaerobic soil slurries. Using this and other available information, IBS will design soil slurry bioreactors for the bioremediation of soils contaminated with high levels of TNT and RDX. IBS will perform a survey of existing data and identify and analyze results from previously performed studies of TNT/RDX biodegradation. Contacts with the Army and Argonne National Laboratory will be established in order to obtain information already generated from their efforts. IBS will also prepare preliminary designs for aerobic and anaerobic soil slurry bioreactors.",

The proposed program will demonstrate the feasibility of the novel interconnect concepts in Phase I, in terms of compeitive performance/cost tradeoffs and process development and related application experiments concerning 3D based interconnect product opportunities. Then Phase II will develop proof-of-concept designs, implement prototype smaples, and perform appopriate evaluation (electrical, thermal, mechanical) on test structures, measurements, together with a processing equipment implemenation plan. A key factor in the viability (e.g., cost, placement, accuracy, yield, reliability, reworkability) of the proposed low cost interconnect concept is usage of a precision, rapidly trainable vision-aided robotic assembly workcell to cost effectively populate the nonflat 3D substate with the components, including automation of most, if not all, of the related process steps (e.g., solder reflow, electrical performance test, mechanical pull test, visual inspection). ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: The benefits of the proposed work are the development of a low cost generic/multipurpose reliable, compliant interconnect methodology that can accommodate a broad variety of interconnect requirements (e.g., between multiple 3D component layers, between components and 3D substrates). This fabrication methodology will lead to life cycle cost-effective means for interconnecting components t",

        "abstract": "This feasbility effort is directed toward analyzing, designing, implementing, and demonstrating standard interfaces for the popular general purpose Intel 860 XR based scalable accelrator array board from several vendors (e.g., SKY Computers). For example, the widely used SKY embedded processor accelerator product family is scalable from 1 to 16 processors (1.28 Gflop) per VME 9U board, with up to 8 board per chassis (128 processors) and up to 8 such chassis in a system, providing over 100 Glops of computing capability at a cost of about $5 million, and power consumption of less than ten kilowatts. however, to effectively uitlize this SUN host based cost-effective, real time embedded super-accelerator, it is esentiual that it be interfaced at a baord level, to enable (hardware based) computational load balancing, with one of several alternate interface standards pertaining to: 1) super-computers/parallel disk arrays, 2) input sensors (e.g., multiple CCD cameras, multiple microphones), and 3) large (e.g., 2048 x 2048 pixels) SBGA format screens. Specific standard interfaces to be demonstrated are: 1) super computer HIPPI (ANSI X3T9.3), 2) multichannel (e.g., 3) RS170 (video), and 3) multiple SBGA (low cost displays. Early prototying experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of capturing incoming video with less than a 1/10 (i.e., 3-1/3 millisec) frame pipeline delay, thereby enabling \"near real time\" multiple video sensor processing. We anticipate a corresponding level of success in implementing above-mentioned scalable I/O interfaces. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: The proposed interfaces will enalbe both military and commercial users to cost-effectively implement HPCC grade systems, both in the (multimedia) laboratory, as well as on real-time embedded applications on-board (e.g., air, surface, ground) moving platforms. This effort will eliminate the constraints faced by current users, in terms of the availability of diverse/mulitiple sensor input, high pixel count display output, and an HPCC compatible interface.",

        "abstract": "Fullerenes form a series of new allotropes of carbon that have a myriad of unusual properties. Fullerene research has seen explosive growth since 1990 when C60 was isolated from carbon soot. However, the prohibitively high price of pure C60 ($2000/g) is a major obstacle to fullerene research and certainly for commercial applications. These high costs are due to the low yields obtained using current technology. We propose to develop superior methods for synthesizing and purifying fullerenes with the goal of dramaticallly reducing the cost for pure fullerenes. We will control fullerene growth to achieve high yields of small and midsized, solvent-extractable fullerenes by minimizing the formation of soot, giant fullerenes, and buckytubes. In addition to eliminating the formation of undesirable side products, we expect to carry out the conversions at significantly lower temperatures and to direct the formation of other fullerene materials, which are not currently available commercially. The efficient synthesis, isolation, and purification of fullerenes would greatly reduce production costs, thereby further stimulating fullerene research and helping to make potential commercial applications for fullerenes a reality.",

Specific instrumentation requirements include the measurement of spherical or non-spherical, opaque or transparent particulates in the size range of 100 - 1000 micrometers. The concentration can vary from the PPM level (by volume) up to concentrations which simulate low visibility sandstorms. Velocities can range from zero to hypersonic Mach numbers at flight environments ranging from sea level up to 200,000 foot altitude, which implies low pressures and freezing tempatures. Insitec proposes to use a combination of three real-time optical measurement methods to provide the required information. These light scattering techniques will be implemented in a prototype design which uses software and hardware concepts that have been previously developed and verified by Insitec. For Phase I, two Insitec instruments (PCSV and EPCS) will be available for preliminary testing under anticipated WPG conditions to show feasibility and to guide specific prototype development in Phase II.",

The combination of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1,) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) has been shown to significantly enhance the healing of partial thickness skin wounds in healthy swine. In preparation for testing this composition on chronic ulcers in human clinical studies, this project will examine the dose dependent efficacy on wounds in diabetic mice of TGF-beta1, IGF-I or the combination of TGF-beta1/IGF-I delivered in a 2% methylcellulose gel vehicle. Specifically, investigators will evaluate the healing of full thickness wounds on genetically diabetic mice (C57BL/KsJdb/db) following the repeated application of: 1) 1.0 mu g of either TGF-beta1, IGF-I, or the TGF-beta1/IGF-I combination and 2) 5.0mu g of either TGF-beta1, IGF-I or the TGF-beta1/IGF-I combination.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS INDICATED HIGH BRIGHTNESS (>10(11) A/M(2)RAD(2)) PERFORMANCE OPERATING AT PRESSURES AS HIGH AS 10(-3) TORR. ROOM TEMPERATURE EMISSION OF ELECTRONS COMBINED WITH HIGH CURRENT CAPABILITY AND HIGH CURRENT DENSITY (POSSIBLY EXCEEDING 100 A/CM(2)) MAY ALLOW BEAMS WITH BRIGHTNESS >10(12) A/M(2)RAD(2), WHICH IS SUPERIOR TO BEAMS FROM PHOTOCATHODES. DURING PHASE I, THE DESIGN, FABRICATION, AND TESTING OF THE FERROELECTRIC CATHODES CAPABLE OF PRODUCING HIGH BRIGHTNESS BEAMS WILL BE CARRIED OUT.

        "abstract": "The hemodynamic collapse of septic shock is the leading cause of death in critically ill patients and is the thirteenth leading cause of death overall in the United States; septic shock accounts for annual medical expenses approaching ten billion dollars. The bacterial component widely believed to be responsible for the induction of sepsis dung gram negative bacteremia is lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS stimulates the production of diverse inflammatory molecules which may ultimately mediate patient demise during sepsis. Therapies attempting to improve patient status following diagnosis of sepsis have been of limited value. We will attempt to develop an anti-idiotype vaccine capable of stimulating anti-LPS antibody titers. These antibodies may induce immunity to toxic effects of LPS by facilitating antibody-mediated clearance of LPS. Prophylactic vaccination with such a product should result in a substantial reduction in the incidence of sepsis. Monoclonal anti-LPS antibodies will be produced by immunizing mice with LPS and utilizing standard hybridoma technology. Anti-LPS will then be used to immunize mice to allow isolation of anti-id secreting hybridomas. Selected anti-ids will be administered to mice to stimulate synthesis of anti-anti-id antibodies. Immunized mice will be tested for resistance to LPS toxicity by observing survival following injection of LD100 doses of LPS.",

        "abstract": "The NCSC evaluates the trustworthiness of computing systems and places them on the Evaluated Products List (EPL). Rare is the time when a monolithic computing system will meet an organization's needs. Rather, systems integrators are called upon to integrate differing hardware platforms and software suites. The EPL is composed on monolithic systems. There is no list of trusted integrated products. This makes the accreditor's job difficult, because a DAA can rarely implement a system directly from the EPL. The Trusted Database Management Interpretation of the TCSEC (TDI) was produced partially as a result of this problem. Although the TDI is geared primarily to DBMSs, it can also be used to evaluate parts of the systems. Putting those parts together is difficult because there is no guidance for accreditors on how these TCB subsets can be securely connected. How does one compose a collection of trusted systems? This is the composibility problem. A model is needed for system developers, integrators, accreditors, and others who must take trusted system components (some of which may be multilevel) and create a system that not only operates but operates securely. This proposal addresses composibility from the viewpoint of an integrator, an evaluator, and an investigator.",

        "abstract": "Technological advances in detector arrays, electronically scanned antennas, datalinks, and advanced processing hardware, are forcing sensor system designers, aircraft developers, and Air Force tacticians to rethink traditional sensor functionality and intraflight tactics. Classical mission roles are changing. Where before, surveillance aircraft vectored autonomous interceptors, each relying on its own fire control radar to perfom search, acquisition, track, and weapon guidance functions, now reconnaissance platforms, fighters and attack aircraft operate on a network that gives them the capability to execute stealthier, more cooperative roles. Smart intraflight resource management allows the flight to cooperatively allocate sensor coverages, prioritize targets, mask equipment failures, assess the situation, and then adapt as the engagement evolves. Multisensor fusion and data internets do promise the benefits of quicker acquisition, more accurate tracks, improved weapon delivery, better system integrity, sensor management, and passive fire control. The challenge is to realize them in real time. Integrated Sensors, Incorporated (ISI) proposes optional Phase I plans that develop specific submodes of the internetted fighter mission. For any of the multisensor internetting prorams proposed, ISI will define multisensor system and operational requirements, specific algorithms and software requirements, demonstrate sections of the submode on our real time, multisensor processing testbed to help estimate processing thoughput requirements, and then provide results, analysis, and performance predictions. Each plan is formulated to allow for a seamless transition into Phase II where ISI will deliver fully functional multisensor software and real time demonstration hardware.",

High-speed networks will expereince a variety of faults, such as link or node failures, excessive buffer overflow due to faulty flow and congestion control mechanisms, and partial failure of the switching fabric. The main goal of this research is to increase the availability of essential network services without compromising efficiency and cost. We proopse a modular software fault tolerance toolkit, called charon, which can be applied at the application level to make network services tolerant to faults that are not handled at the hardware and operating systems levels. Charon consists of a library of functions providing network services with heart beats, checkpointing and critical data recovering, and a mechanism consisting of four watching processing to monitor the heart beats of the netwrok services and to recover crashed processes back to thei last checkpoints. With the toolkit, network services can achieve fault tolerance with a minimum amount of changes to their source code. In this proposal, the functionality of each of the modules in Charon will be studied. The application of the toolkit to a typical network service for improving fault tolerance will be demonstrated. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: The anticipated result of this project is a toolkit and a mechanism to achieve fault tolerance in a wide range of network services. The toolkit outlined in this proposal will have a huge market potential for software and information systems vendors who are required to provide to users fault tolerance and high availability without excessive overhead.",

Our work differs from the enormous wealth of work already done in active vibration isolation because our work focuses on six degree of freedom vibration isolation. Mechanically, our system uses a unique configuration which decouples the motion in each of the six degrees of freedom. The actuators we developed exploit magnetostrictive material and therefore have higher force capability and longer stroke than piezoelectric actuators which are conventionally used, and magnetostrictive material has no known deterioratioin with age (while piezoelectrics are known to deteriorate with age). Algorithmically, we developed an adaptive filter approach to six degree of freedom vibration isolation which dynamically learns the characteristics of the host structure. Experimental hardware was built and tested. Our system obtains 30 dBs of attenuation in the accelerations measured on the isolated structure when the active control system was operating. This proposal details how we will apply and extend our previous results ot active/passive launch payload isolation systems.",

        "abstract": "The problem described in the RFP is to build a system which will be able to detect intrusion from a moving platform. The solution herein proposed is based on a new type of camera designed by Intelligent Automation, Incorporated. This new type of camera produces a three dimensional image of the scene at normal video frame rates of 60 frames per second. Our Fast 3D Imaging camera will generate 3 dimensional images in real time. By \"3 Dimensional Image\" we mean that the value of each pixel in the image will represent the distance from the camera's focal point to the corresponding point in the scene. We call this type of image a range image. Our intrusion detection approach uses the range camera for what is basically visual inspection. A conventional videotape would be made of the vehicle's patrol path where the videotape would be recording the range image from the range camera (not a normal intensity image). This can be thought of as the \"teach mode, \" where both the path and the expected range recording is captured at normal frame rates. Then as the vehicle moves through its normal patrol path, it continually compares its real-time range image with the pre-recorded \"normal\" range image. Minor differences are used to control the vehicle along the pre-defined path. Significant deviations must be caused by unexpected changes in the area and would raise ail alarm. The same range camera Output can also be used for obstacle avoidance. Our Fast 3D Imaging camera can also capture normal intensity images by switching the state of a single control bit. The range image and the intensity image can therefore be used without requinng an additional camera.",

Isokinetic machines are used to both measure and stress the muscles in upper extremities, lower extremities, and trunk. There are thousands of isokinetic machines in daily use in physical therapy applications throughout the world. Virtually every outpatient physical therapy clinic as well as chiropractors and some physician's offices have at least one of these machines. The primary shortfall with the current isokinetic machines is that the motion they allow and the forces they measure are all limited to one plane at a time. A patient can move the manipulandum in the coronal plane, the sagittal plane, or the traverse plane, but not at the same time. In order to switch the machine from allowing one type of motion to another requires the machine to be manually set up for the new operation by a thera- pist; the set up operations can take several minutes.

The AVS design is based on a asynchronous analog encoding of location and motion data, and a custom VLSI Hybrid Temporal Processing Element (HTPE) developed by and available solely to IRS (patent pending). The HTPE can operate on analog data at frequencies in excess of 100 MHz, allowing rapid oversampling methods to be used for resolution enhancement, motion detection, and multiple-template matching. HTPEs have low device count and power dissipation, and can be fabricated in small layout areas. The AVS is intended for eventual on-board application in robots, intelligent machine tools, and other autonomous sensory-motor systems that require visible, IR, or similar input. Binocular fusion will be used to derive dipth information by comparing the primary-feature maps gnerated by feature detectors for two spatially-separated retinas. The goal of this Phase I proposal is to evaluate the feasibility of a binocular object recognition system for the AVS based on the HTPE.",

IntelliPro believes interactive simulation with multisensory computer-based instruction (CBI), that combines social problem-solving training with practice in simulated HIV-risk situations may be useful in developing these skills. The goal of the research is to establish the technical feasibility of developing interactive simulation to help adolescent females acquire and generalize those behavioral skills and strategies useful for responding appropriately in situations that put them at risk for HIV. We will: (a) identify and catalog specific situations perceived by adolescent females as likely to put them at risk for HIV and corresponding HIV-preventive behaviors, (b) determine if a proven social problem-solving training program can be repurposed for CBI to promote development and generalization of the desired behaviors, and (c) design a software structure and specify a computer platform to economically deliver the training. To investigate this approach, a team of experienced professionals with expertise in simulation and instructional system design, social skills training, and community-based HIV prevention programs has been assembled.",

It is the most destructive single infectious agent of mankind in the Third World. Furthermore, it is responsible for more human energy loss, debilitation, loss of work capacity, and economic damage than any other human ailment facing the world today. The specific aim is to test novel morpholino-type antisense molecules for anti-malarial activity by targeting a critical gene of Plasmodium which encodes the bifunctional enzyme dihydrofolate reductase/thymidine synthase. This enzyme is essential for folate synthesis and salvage in the malarial parasite. The major obstacles to overcome in the development of antisense-type therapeutic agents include stability to nuclease activity, transport/delivery, binding affinity, target specificity, ease of synthesis, and cost effectiveness. The novel morpholino-type antisense agents overcome all of these potential drawbacks. Based on preliminary information, we believe that these molecules will be readily taken up by Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes and result in the suppression of parasite growth. Specifically, we intend to develop novel morpholino- type antisense molecules as anti-malarial/anti-parasitic therapeutic agents.",

Currently, such materials as SiC provide a source of matrix fiber. In projected applications for alumides, desirable characteristics of reinforcing fibers are compatible coefficient of expansion (CTE) with the matrix, good oxidation resistance, high tensile strength at elevated temperatures and mass production feasibility, while remaining cost effective. Much work has been dedicated to development of discontinous short whisker and continuous fibers of alumina and sapphire. The CTE of alumides is more than twice that of SiC, while Aluminum Oxide more closely approaches that of potential matrix materials. What we propose is the development of a complete process in growing long whiskers of sufficient lengths to spin into multistrand thread. Further, to treat the thread via a newly developed process to further strengthen the physical characteristics such as hardness, tensile, and compressive strength. Such a process to change the wetting characteristics of the thread making it more compatible with metalization, bonding to plastics and other ceramics. The completed thread may be woven into mat as matrix reinforcement.",

The objective of this study is to develop automated tools to help cruise missile mission planners determine the optimum route and best reference sites so that viable TERCOM maps can be constructed to meet tactical requirements. The specific objective during the Phase I work is to develop a technique to determine the feasibility of the proposed approach for identifying the best combination of factors for the development of TERCOM maps to meet tactical objectives. The terrain roughness can provide only an indirect index to predict the suitability of TERCOM site selection. A more direct approach is to use the Monte Carlo simulation technique for the purpose. In the direct simulation proposed herein a reference terrain map and a sample realistic map error will be combined to create the on-board TERCOM map. The measurements of a radar altimeter and a baro-damped inertial navigation system will be generated. Four different trajectory orientations and three different sizes of on-board maps will be evaluated, each of which consists of 441 trials uniformaly placed on the map.

From these measurements, thermodynamic fluctuations may be derived. The innovative features of the Multi-element Wind Tunnel Probe (MWTP) are two fold. First, the signals are based on optical effects for fast response and high resolution. Second, the transducer array will be fabricated using semiconductor manufacturing techniques and will be coated with diamond-like films for protection against high temperature, corrosive wind tunnel conditions. Design of a compact probe with multiple sensors is proposed in Phase I. Prototype demonstrations of the critical components will be done. Through the use of such a system, high temporally and spatially resolved measurements may be made in hostile environments. The importance of this innovation is its impact on aerospace research and in particular, as a powerful new diagnostic for wind tunnel studies.",

        "abstract": "During flight testing, an aircraft's performance is evaluated using data obtained from sensors placed throughout the airframe. The data is transmitted to a central data acquisition center via hardwire connections. This hardwire system has been found to be unsatisfactory due to high costs incurred from installation and removal. The ideal solution to reducing costs would be a data collection system that could be easily installed and removed. Invocon has developed a system which satisfies the above criteria. Consisting of both hardware and software, the system is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) data communications network that incorporates remote sensor units which can be easily installed without wiring. They can also be powered for extended periods of time with internal batteries or can connect to the aircraft bus power. Utilizing data gathering units that communicate via radio, the network implements both narrow and wide band communications to obtain the efficiency of a high speed system with very low power consumption. At the data analysis center, an operator can program the data gathering units to respond to specific instructions. We propose to demonstrate the capabilities of this AI data communications network in a non-flying airframe test. At the conclusion of Phase I, the viability of a wireless airborne instrumentation system will be proven.",

First, the computer/keyboard unit is not conveniently portable and certainly not pocket sized; thus, the system can not provide speech along with easy mobility. Second, typing is not an efficient input mechanism for real time conversation on a pocket-sized unit. The \"Talking Pen\" device is designed to overcome both of these limitations. A solution to the mobility limitation is enabled by the current trends in pen-input digitizers, recognition technology, and high density electronics.

It is highly user friendly, incorporating an effective graphical user interface. While this tool is able to provide for the modeling, planning and analysis of SAFENET and FDDI networks, it is currently recognized that many naval (including NTCS-A, OSS, NGCR and Copernicus programs) and commercial implementations require the installation of a multi-network system which interconnects multiple such networks.

This approach will further the understanding of the degradation of benzoate through the beta-ketoadipate metabolic pathway in Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, an ubiquitous soil bacterium. This pathway was chosen as a model system for many reasons: the pathway contains 5 of the 6 recognized enzyme classes, the genes have been isolated and sequenced, many mutant strains have been characterized, and A. calcoaceticus is extremely amenable to molecular genetic manipulation.

SIMULATION MODELING IS A USEFUL TOOL FOR PREDICTING HOW WELL SYSTEMS AND SUBSYSTEMS PERFORM TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE A FACILITY'S DEFINED REPROCESSING GOAL. HOWEVER, WITH CURRENTLY AVAILABLE SIMULATION SOFTWARE IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO INCLUDE SPECIFIC FAILURE AND REPAIR INFORMATION IN THE SIMULATION MODEL. NOT BEING ABLE TO INCLUDE RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, AND MAINTAINABILITY (RAM) CONSIDERATIONS IN A SIMULATION MODEL MAKES THE RESULTS LESS ACCURATE AND POTENTIALLY MISLEADING. THEREFORE, IT IS PLANNED TO DEVELOP RAM INTERFACE SOFTWARE FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS THAT WILL HELP DESIGNERS EFFICIENTLY INCORPORATE RAM TECHNIQUES INTO EXISTING PROCESS SIMNULATION SOFTWARE AND PROVIDE RAM-BASED RESULTS NEEDED TO REDUCE THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE PERFORMANCE OF FACILITY DESIGN (E.G., THE EXPECTED THROUGHPUT WITH FAILURE AND REPAIR ADDRESSED). TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING SUCH SOFTWARE, THE FOLLOWING TECHNICAL APPROACH FOR PHASE I WILL BE USED: (1) COLLECT DATA ON A REPROCESSING FACILITYS DESIGN, OPERATION, AND MAINTENANCE AND SELECT A PORTION OF THE FACILITY TO STUDY, (2) SELECT A SIMULATION SOFTWARE PACKAGE THAT CAN EASILY EXCHANGE DATA WITH OTHER SOFTWARE PACKAGES, (3) DEVELOP A RAM-ANALYSIS INTERFACE THAT COMMUNICATES WITH THE SELECTED SIMULATION SOFTWARE, (4) OBTAIN RAM-BASED PROCESS SIMULATION RESULTS FOR THE EXAMLE ANALYSIS, AND (5) DOCUMENT THE FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS ON THE FEASIBILITY OF INCORPORATING RAM ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES INTO SIMULATION MODELING. PHASE II WILL FOCUS ON DEVELOPING RAM-INTERFACE SOFTWARE THAT CAN BE USED WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF SIMULATION SOFTWARE PACKAGES.

This demonstration will utilize the JRS IDAS tool set, which has been effectively applied to this problem, for several very high performance signal processing systems, over the past few years. JRS is also proposing to perform a design study and to define an approach for extending the Uni-processor capability, demonstrated above, to a multi-processor (i.e., network) capability. The approach will be based on the Navy PGM toolset and the capabilities of Ada 9X. The study will be performed around a general Attached Processor System Model that was developed in an earlier study for NAVSEA. This model has been found by JRS to be applicable to most modern military signal and image processing systems. In Phase II, the multi-processor capability will be implemented within the IDAS framework and the resulting prototype will be demonstrated on a Navy provided algorithmic processing chain.",

ONE OF THE MAJOR PROBLEMS IN CONDUCTING AN EFFICIENT EOR PROCESS IS THE CONTROL OF THE INJECTED FLUIDS. IN MOST FIELD APPLICATIONS OF MISCIBLE OR IMMISCIBLE SOLVENT DRIVES, SUCH AS CARBON DIOXIDE OR LIGHT HYDROCARBON FLOODS, THE PRESENCE OF RESERVOIR HETEROGENEITIES LEADS TO EARLY SOLVENT BREAKTHROUGH. BY OFFERING A PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE, THE HIGH PERMEABILITY STREAKS OR THIEF ZONES TAKE THE BULK OF THE INJECTED SOLVENT, AND, AS A CONSEQUENCE, LARGE VOLUMES OF THE RESERVOIR OIL ARE LEFT UNSWEPT. REDIRECTING THE INJECTED SOLVENT SO THAT PREVIOUSLY UNSWEPT VOLUMES OF THE RESERVOIR CAN BE ACCESSED ALLOWS FOR ADDITIONAL OIL RECOVERY. THIS REQUIRES IN-DEPTH PLUGGING OF THESE HIGH PERMEABILITY STREAKS. THE EFFICACY OF THE DIVERTING PROCESS WOULD BE FURTHER INCREASED IF THE PLUGGING MECHANISM WAS IMPLEMENTED VIA THE INJECTED SOLVENT, AS THIS WOULD DELIVER THE PLUGGING AGENTS DIRECTLY TO THETHIEF ZONE TAKING THE SOLVENT. THE PHASE I INVESTIGATION ADDRESSES THAT ISSUE BY STUDYING A SIMPLE SCHEME WHEREBY A PLUGGING AGENT SOLUBLE IN THE INJECTED SOLVENT IS ADDED AT THE WELLHEAD.

These assessment tools usually consider variabilities in site characteristics, target attributes like strength and stiffness, and weapon delivery charactenstics. Current vulnerability procedures are overly conservative in that, to ensure high confidence in sustaining the facilities' mission, they presume a \"worst-case scenano\" in the use of values for target strength or weapon CEP. The problem is compounded by the fact that the loading on a target is caused by a weapon environment whose effects on the target are highly variable, and where significant changes in some parameters can require a complete change in the vulnerability model. Our Phase I research objective is to demonstrate the powerful capabilities of an object-oriented framework approach, by building a software environment to conduct embedded simulation exercises for assessment. We will demonstrate the software environment by implementing into our framework two or three simple existing two-dimensional continuuncodes running on a single hardware architecture and integmted with one or two simple vulnerability codes .",

Phase I will choose three candidate composite systems for study, categorize required ballistic properties, and obtain panels for the test. The ballistic damage will be characterized using ultrasonic tests (through transmission and pulse-echo imaging). The panels will be ballistic tested as per MIL-STD-662. Fractures due to the ballistic damage will be characterized using scanning electron microscope (SEM) techniques. Correlations will be made between the fracture behavior, ballistic loads and material type.

        "abstract": "The automated inspection of gas turbine components has proven to be difficult due to their complex geometry. While ultrasonics has demomstrated excellent capabilities in detecting and characterizing the erosion and corrosion on turbine components from the hot effluent gases, it's application details laborious alignment procedures for the ultrasonic transducer during inspection. The need for automated inspection systems has become more pressing with the proposed next-generation gas turbine where ceramic materials are being cobsidered for their high temperature capability and reduced cooling requirements. Critical flaw sizes for ceramics are smaller than those for metals and the ceramics fail catastrophically due to their brittle nature. A novel method for conducting the automated ultrasonic inspection of ceramic turbine blades and other complex-geometry gas turbine components is proposed. The innovation of this method lies in the development of a software package, called the CAD-Nde Translator (CADNET), which generates motion control commands from the CAD drawings of a complex geometry part. The motion control commands are used to instruct an inspection robot to closely follow the contour of the part. In Phase I, we will develop this translator. In Phase II, we will integrate this translator into a high-frequency ultrasonic system and evaluate it by conducting the automated inspection of ceramic turbine blades.",

        "abstract": "Higher performances from gas turbines by increasing turbine speeds, loads and temperature place increased emphasis on the operation and reliability of engine components such as bearings and gears. The fatigue lives of such components are severely reduced by the presence of residual tensile stresses, introduced by the grinding and finishing processes during component manufacture. There is acute need for nondestructive methods which can perform routine inspections of these components and detect these near-surface stresses reliably and accurately. Three different magnetic methods for the nondestructive measurement of residual stresses in rolling element bearings are proposed. These methods consist of the Barkhausen Noise Analysis (BNA, also called MBE for Magnetic Barkhausen Emission), the Magnetically Induced Velocity Change (MIVC) and the Stress Induced Magnetic Anisotropy (SMA) measurement techniques. These three methods along with other candidate technologies will be evaluated in the process of developing prototype instrumentation for stress measurement.",

        "abstract": "Our innovative proposal is to apply the design refinement approach, as implemented in the Reacto Verification System (RVS), to construct verified VHDL models. RVS includes a specification language, with features fundamental to the specification of hardware systems, a graphical interface used to construct specifications; a verification subsystem that includes a verification condition generator, and a state-of-the-art theorem prover integrated into a comprehensive verification environment; a simulator used to rapid prototype a specification; and a transformation system used to transform specifications into target code using transformations formally proved to be correctness preserving. We propose to perform design studies to define extensions to Reacto for the specification and generation of VHDL hardware descriptions. These extensions include the construction a VHDL back-end to the transformation system, and extensions to the specification language, simulation environment, and verification environment. The design study will analyze one significant sample problem: a hardware implementation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm. RVS leverages off of and contributes to the considerable technology base available at Kestrel. This project will be done in cooperation with Capt. Paul Bailor of AFIT.",

However, there is no widely disseminated training program for practitioners. Workshops are available occasionally but no training video exists. A training program for clinical investigators conducting efficacy trials has been developed but is not available outside specific funded trials. The aim of Phase One is to adapt the training program for use by practitioners and to develop the program for videotape. We will accomplish this goal by working with the project consultant to write a demonstration video. We will test the effectiveness of the tape for training practitioners by conducting a test in which psychotherapists will be randomly assigned to read the training manual or to read the training manual and screen the videotape. We will videotape the psychotherapists in sessions with depressed patients to evaluate their IPT skills. This process will provide the basis for proceeding with Phase Two in which an entire series of IPT videotapes will be developed.",

        "abstract": "We seek PHS assistance in the prototype construction of a radically new, massively parallel mass spectrometer. Performance limitations imposed by the physics of contemporary mass spectrometer design seriously impede progress in meeting demands of biomedical and clinical mass analysis. We accept these realities and turn to a new mass analysis architecture. The prototype ion processing unit (IPU) operates as a space filling ion FIFO buffer, simultaneous and asychronously capturing, cooling, and storing large numbers of ions within N parallel ion conducting channels. Mass analysis occurs along an M fold parallel axis orthogonal to N, constituting an NXM massively parallel array. If successful, the device may profoundly extend the operational capabilities of affordable mass spectrometry. During Phase I, a simple NxM array, driven by computer controlled solid state Rf amplifiers, is tested in a specially modified Hewlett-Packard 5989 mass spectrometer. This will provide elementary experimental data for comparison with operations previously predicted by theory. During Phase II, array hardware is extended to include active ion cooling and signal extraction along M parallel axes. If successful, an IPU for commercial manufacture would be developed under Phase III. This could operate as a stand alone mass spectrometer or as an ion-optic component to significantly extend the capabilities of present instrumentation, such as TOF.",

The disease has implications for growth and development of those children who survive it. However, long-term impacts can be reduced when the disease is detected early in its course. The key is the ability of NICU nurses to detect subtle signs and symptoms that lead them to suspect NEC and advocate on behalf of the infant. If the requisite nursing skills could be extracted, documented, and disseminated, inexperienced NICU nurses would be better able to spot NEC early on and to intervene appropriately. We will test the feasibility of using a Critical Decision method (CDM) of knowledge engineering to identify and document the assessment skills required to detect NEC early on. Based on the CDM interviews, Nursing Care Profiles will be developed that depict expert clinical judgment and patient care skills. The Profiles will be evaluated by Nurse Researchers, Clinical Specialists, neonatalogists, and NICU staff nurses.",

        "abstract": "Despite the popularity of CAD/CAM systems today, over 90% of all drawings in the U.S. are not computer processable as they exist only in paper or microfilm. Without the development of technology to convert raster drawing to product data model, this situation is like to persist for some tine as over 50% of all new drawings are still being executed on paper. This vast backlog of manual drawings is a serious problem to logistic support as most engineering projects involve incremental changes to, or reuse of components in existing designs. The current practice of overlaying vector drawings on top of raster images necessitates investment in vast amounts of persistent data storage. Raster images cannot be used with modern CAD/CAM/CAE systems. This proposal describes a system that will input information from a raster to vector converter, and with human assistance, output produce-data models (PDES). The system uses an approach that takes advantage connectionist techniques (Neural nets and Fuzzy logic) with traditional knowledge-based techniques. A three-phase process is used: 1) recognition of abstract topological patterns, 2) hypothesizing product data prototypes for these abstract patterns, and 3) validation of prototype shapes within the context of the evolving product-data model using constraint propagation.",

        "abstract": "In the control of air pollution on military bases, increasing emphasis is needed for technologies applicable to dilute concentrations of pollutants in air. For example, the control of indoor air pollution associated with solvent degreasing operations is necessary, including the dilute emissions associated with exhaust ventilation fans. Air stripping of contaminated groundwater often produces dilute emissions for which current destruction technology provides no economic solutions. Activated carbon adsorption could be used, but is often uneconomical for these cases and can create a hazardous solid waste which is increasingly difficult to manage. In the proposed research, the technical feasibility is to be established of integrating a highly effective adsorbent with catalyzed ultraviolet (UV) oxidation to obtain a novel dilute phase air pollution control process. This adsorption Integrated Reaction (AIR) Process concentrates organics on an adsorbent transparent to UV light. The contanminant is then catalytically destroyed at high selectivity. The feasibility study is to be conducted with chlorinated compounds, but the AIR process should also be applicable to volatile organic compounds emissions control.",

Energizing the pulser after penetration minimizes the effectiveness of the satellit'e EM shielding and penetration minimizes the effectiveness of the satellite's EM Shielding and closely couples the EMP signal to the targets electronic systems. This permits the modest electrical energies that can be stored in the projectile to be lethal. Since the Kill Mechanism is EM rather than KE debris production can be minimized. Confirmation that a satellite has been intercepted cna be detected by monitoring.

        "abstract": "Second-harmonic generation, electrooptic modulation and optical beam steering are among the most important applications of second-order nonlinear optical processes. A new concept in the design of novel nonlinear optical materials is proposed in which second order chromophores are incorporated in polymers with low glass transition temperatures (Tg). Quasi phase-matched second-harmonic generation in such materials can be realized by periodically poling the chromophores in the direction of the electric field; there is no SHG in the absence of the poling fields. Optical beam steering can also be realized due to the change in the refractive index of the film caused by the applied electric fields. The proposed polymers possess low glass transition temperatures that allow the small chromophore molecules to reorient under the presence of an applied electric field. The requirements for the active chromophore molecules include high hyperpolarizability, B, small size, and ease of processability. The large molecular hyperpolarizability provides higher second-order nonlinear optical responses when aligned in the direction of the poling electric field. The small size of the dopant molecules and the low glass transition temperature of the host medium will ensure facile reorientation of these molecules under the applied electric field, fast nonlinear optical response and large change in refractive index. The time scale for the response can be expected to be microseconds or faster.",

        "abstract": "Direct pumping of an OPO by diode laser represents the most desirable and most efficient configuration for a parametric source in the mid-infrared. Combining recent advances in single frequency diode lasers with advanced nonlinear materials offering advantageous phase matching properties, we propose to demonstrate a parametric oscillator directly pumped by a laser diode. As state-of-the-art diode laser pump sources provide sw and quasi-cw output, the parametric oscillator will operate in a cw or long pulse regime. In contrast to previous cw parametric oscillators, the system will rely on non-degenarate operation of the OPO, thus providing 2 distinct output wavelengths, with the signal and/or idler output lying in a region of high atmospheric transmission. Our design utilizes a non-critically phase matched interaction in silver thiogallate, AgGaS sub2 , to achieve a long interaction length and low threshold. Singly resonant operation as well as a lower threshold doubly resonant system will be explored. Following the evaluation of various pump/oscillator designs, the proposed Phase I program includes a series of risk reduction experiments to verify the baseline design and choice of nonlinear gain medium. These experiments include the demonstration of a cw pumped doubly resonant OPO.",

A NOVEL APPROACH BASED UPON ADVANCED SOLID-STATE MICROLASER TECHNOLOGY IS PLANNED TO SATISY THIS REQUIREMENT. THE DESIGN UTILIZES ADIODE PUMPED ELECTRO-OPTICALLY TUNABLE MONOLITHIC MICROLASER THAT ALLOWS FOR FAST CONTROL OF THE CAVITY RESONANCE FREQUENCY. THUS, THE FREQUENCY CAN BE TUNED/SCANNED BY SIMPLY APPLYING A VOLTAGE TO THE LASER. THIS IS IN CONTRAST TO SLOWER FREQUENCY CONTROL TECHNIQUES WHICH UTILIZEPIEZOELECTRIC OR PUMP POWER MODULATION. THE IR EMISSION OF THE SOURCE IS CONVERTED TO THE VISABLE USING INTRACAVITY NONLINEAR TECHNIQUES IN A DESIGN WHICH AVOIDS INSTABILITIES FROM NONLINEAR MIXING. THE ANTICIPATED PERFORMANCE OF THE SYSTEM RESULTS IN A SOURCE WITH A FREQUENCY STABILITY OF BETTER THAN 2 MHz, WITH A FAST LINEWIDTH OF 10 KHz, THUS MAKING IT IDEALFOR PRECISION INSTRUMENT CALIBRATION. THIS MICROLASER TECHNOLOGY OFFERS THE POTENTIAL FOR EXTREMELY FREQUENCY-STABLE, COMPACT, LOW COST, OSCILLATORSR IN THE VISABLE AND IR REGION. THE UNIQUE TECHNOLOGY REPRESENTS A SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT OVER CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART NONPLANAR MONOLITHIC LASERS. FOR THE ABSOLUTE LONG TERM STABILITY REQUIREMENTS OF U-AVLIS, THE ELECTRO-OPTIC MICROLASER CAN BE REFERENCED TO A MOLECULAR ABSORPTION CELL OR CRYSTAL OSCILLATOR. THE PHASE I PROJECT INCLUDES A SERIES OF RISK REDUCTION EXPERIMENTS DESIGNED TO GENERATE NARROW LINEWIDTH, FREQUENCY STABLE, VISIBLE MICROLASERS. PHASE I WILL DEVELOP A DIODEPUMPED VISIBLE SOURCE IN A MONOLITHIC PACKAGE. CHARACTERIZATION OF THE SOURCE WILL LEAD TO A DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A CLOSED-LOOP FREQUENCY CONTROL SYSTEM REFERENCED TO AN ULTRA-STABLE CAVITY.",

        "abstract": "Currently, wide bandwidth, microwave fiber optic links suffer from excessive loss due to the poor conversion efficiency of laser drive current to photodectector signal current. An additional disadvantage of this high loss is a relatively poor noise figure for the microwave link. These fiber optic links would be more easily used in many applications if this link loss could be significantly reduced. Several methods have been proposed to more effectively couple the RF input power to the laser diode mar microwave frequencies over wide bandwidth, both passively and actively, but none have been demonstrated. In this work we will design a passive, wide bandwidth matching network that combines a microstrip transformer along with a lumped element transformer to match a 50ohm system to a 4ohm laser diode. Improvement in electrical link loss is expected to be 10dB. Additionally, we will study the feasibility of developing wide bandwidth active matching circuits to further reduce electrical link loss. This study will include both lumped and distributed amplifier techniques. The anticipated link loss improvement will be 20dB over resistive matching to the laser diode. The expected bandwidth is 6 to 18 GHz.",

Current plasma bags are susceptible to low temperature fracture and frequently engender plasma/liquid warming medium contamination. Plastic bag over-wraps mitigate contamination dangers, but extend the thaw/warming time. These problems cause plasma waste due to thawing in advance of anticipated usage. Preliminary data suggest that enhancing freeze/thaw processes by reconfiguring standard blood products bags to optimize the volume/surface area ratio can lead to improved clotting protein levels. These enhancements can be obtained while utilizing a dry thawing medium which eliminates contamination and are fast enough to allow thawing only for immediate demand. Constructing reconfigured bags from a laminated film appears to alleviate breakage problems. First, we will develop design data for a dry freezing device incorporated into the reconfigured dry thawing device. Second, an appropriately approved film will replace PVC in a reconfigured bag. Third, validate the preliminary results utilizing reconfigured, replacement film bags. Finally, investigate factors such as time, temperature and processing speed surrounding clotting protein recovery and utilize them to optimize both device and bag performance for commercial development.",

This protocol should allow measurement of human growth hormone (hGH) in samples of urine or saliva as opposed to the standard serum assay. Thus, this will provide a noninvasive test to allow multiple hGH measurements without the associated visits to a practitioner for blood sampling.

        "abstract": "We will develop a compact diode-pumped laser system for non-ionizing imaging of soft tissue. The following paragraph describes this concept. Two single-frequency lasers, when aligned and overlapping onto a photodiode, create a heterodyne signal in the detector proportional to each beam's amplitude. A scattering medium placed in one beam's path scatters light outside of the beam, so the heterodyne signal results only from unscattered light. If a dense embedded object attenuates the beam, the heterodyne signal decreases and the object can be imaged. Additionally, the frequency of the heterodyne signal allows the use of an extremely sensitive detection system, which allows for imaging through thicker samples. Lightwave has demonstrated this concept in a simple setup using two single frequency diode-pumped Nd:YAG lasers. The goals of Phase I are to explore the limits of this system by optimizing the signal detection system, exploring other possible laser systems or configurations, and measuring systems characteristics such as spatial resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and data acquisition rates. At the completion of the Phase I, we expect to be able to generate two dimensional images through tissue samples. During Phase II, we expect to develop a complete prototype imaging system.",

This provides a high sensitivity analysis tool for biomedical research and clinical diagnosis. The most commonly used laser for these applications is the 488nm Ar-ion laser, since it is well- matched to the excitation wavelength of fluorescein dyes which are the most widely used. However, this laser is less than optimal for these applications: it is fairly large, has low efficiency, it dissipates excess heat in the instrument, and consumes substantial electrical power. It also has limited lifetime, so regular repair is necessary. This Phase I aims to investigate the feasibility of developing a compact, efficient, robust, long-lifetime laser source that would be a superior, cost-effective replacement for Ar-ion lasers in biomedical instrumentation. It would be based on new InGaAs disde lasers. The near-infrared output of this device would be frequency-doubled in a nonlinear crystal to achieve a wavelength of approximately 490nm, optimal for these applications. We will use a resonant doubling cavity to achieve good conversion efficiency. The Phase II follow-on would entail developing a 490nm source optimized for use in biomedical instruments.",

The resulting technology will not only serve to accelerate logical programs, but also other inferential processes involving search.

Hence the proposed project has wide-ranging implications for artificial intelligence and its applications to practical systems. Moreoever, the project is to such scope that a number of derivative applications are expected. For instance, a key aspect of the proposed work lies in parallel search through a society of cooperating modules. The resulting technology will therefore be useful for any distributed computational process, including parallel search through a large network of databases. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: A high performance inference machine will have wide-ranging applications in any domain where high-level reasoning is paramount. Such applications occur in all fields of commerce, industry, and science, as demonstrated by previous artifical intelligence programs in these fields. Moreover, the aspect of the work on parallel search will be applicable to many disciplines and industries, from outline libraries to image processing, and from commercial customer lists to industrial data sets.",

As the animal experiments have progressed, there have arisen increasingly severe problems with adverse tissue response in the skin covering the subcutaneous TETS coil. An experiment is proposed to test the hypothesis that the tissue necrosis is caused by a combination of compromised skin perfusion and local heating associated with the TETS coils. An alternate coil configuration will be evaluated in animal experiments. During these evaluations, a well per fused muscle will be interposed between the TETS coils providing a convective transport mechanism, so heat can be carried away from the site. The experiments are to be carried out at one of the laboratories which has observed the problem with a conventional coil configuration. We have developed a TETS which has demonstrated excellent power transmission efficiency with the anticipated intercoil spacing. We will develop a commercial TETS which offers improved tissue viability.",

Mortality due to colorectal cancer is second only to lung cancer and is estimated to cause 58,300 deaths a year. New case estimates are higher and are more than double for 1992. Site specific drug delivery is a desirable form of administering drugs. The benefits are increased efficiency and reduced toxic side effects. The anticancer natural diterpenoid, taxol, was found to have significant anti-tumor activity against a variety of cancers. It differs from other naturally occurring drugs because it has a unique mechanism of action which promotes the assembly of microtubules and inhibits their disassembly inhibiting cell proliferation. Taxol therapy suffers due to water solubility problems of the drug resulting in formulation problems. There are several approaches to attain this goal through the prepara- tion of salts. These acid-base salts have problems of stability, toxicity, physiological pH disturbance and non-specific hydrolysis by esterases. Although there are more than 60 derivatives known, taxol beta-glucosides and beta-galactosides are not known. Such derivatives are attractive because they are likely to have increased water solubility and reduced absorption in the upper G.I. tract. More importantly both types of glycosides might be expected in analogy with other plant glycosides, to be cleaved by bacterial glycosidases, and to regenerate as a site-specific chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of colorectal cancer. The specific aims are 1. the synthesis of taxol glucoside and galactoside, 2. determination of the partition coefficients, 3. enzymatic hydrolysis of the prodrug by glycosidases, and 4. in vitro and in vivo hydrolysis of the glycosides by contents of rat gastrointestinal tract.",

It is also a goal that this new class of actuation device will offer a degree of life like physical flexibility in its coupling to loads that is similar to animal muscle and tendons.

Older patients in particular may present problems of compliance with instructions and adherence to medical regimens. Additionally, elderly patients with chronic illnesses may be susceptible to mood disorders which further decrease the likelihood of compliance. This project uses a therapeutic model that allows a provider to establish specific behavioral goals for a patient and monitor the patient's progress through daily computer-initiated telephone interactions. Patients respond to pre-recorded questions which reinforce their progress toward their behavioral goals. Telephone interactions also educate, motivate and reassure patients. The long-term objectives are to improve compliance with treatment regimens, to improve patients' perceived health status, and to reduce the cost of providing care. In Phase I, we will modify the existing computer program to address the needs of older patients and conduct a small-scale outcome study comparing the effectiveness of the program with traditional clinical follow-up care.

Computed image microscopy uses the amplitude and phase information available from a Normarski image to calculate various types of microscopic views. One set of image data can be used to visualize all common microscopic viewing modes. Normarski imaging has been shown to provide a high degree of optical sectioning. Consequently, computed image microscopy may provide sectioning capability similar to confocal microscopy. The technique has promise for cellular and macroscopic imaging. Structural views could provide three-dimensional representations of dermatologic disease. Phase I research will evaluate whether computed image microscopy is experimentally practical and will compare its performance to that of a confocal imaging system. Both visible and infrared illumination will be used in the system. Infrared light will provide enhanced penetration of tissue, thus, allowing diagnosis of conditions substantially beneath the surface of the skin.",

        "abstract": "Corrosion in the crevices of gasketed joints in the presence of seawater have been particularly troublesome for the Navy and may cause serious damage in assembled seawater pipe joints. The disassembling of numerous pipe joints comprising gasketed flanges is tedious, slow and is a costly way for crevice corrosion inspection. Therefore, a need exists for new nondestructive techniques of crevice corrosion detection. Some of the existing nondestructive techniques, e.g., electrochemical techniques, scanning current probe, and scanning potential probe, are based on corrosion examination from the water side, i.e., sensors have to be introduced inside the pipelines. These are impractical and not necessarily relevant to localized crevice corrosion. Techniques which may be used without penetrating the pipline system include ultrasonics, radiography, eddy current measurements and neutral radiographic spectroscopy. However, most of them suffer from low signal-to-noise ratios. The innovative approach proposed here is based on the application of four probe resistivity measurements for the detection of pit formation and thickness changes of flange alloys in gasketed pipe joints caused by crevice corrosion. This approach has the dual advantages of being nondestructive and very simple. The probe is attached on the outer surface of the flange, and there is no need for disassembling a flange. If shown to be successful in the detection of thickness changes due to pits formed at the netal part of the gasket/flange crevices, this technique has the potential to be easily designed as a fast remote sensing technique for crevice corrosion detection of gasketed pipe joints. The main advantages would be that the sensing probe apparatus can be easily adapted for inspection of different sizes of flanges, quickly mounted and dismantled, easily maneuvered on the outer side of the joint, and the costs for development and application of this technique will be very low. By means of multiple and repeated resistivity measurements of the whole area of possible attack by crevice corrosion, and after graphical data processing by computer, an image may be obtained. aookucatuib",

        "abstract": "While most soft tissue wounds are normally capable of reasonable repair without treatment, such repair occurs via scarring and contracture, often accompanied by some loss of appearance and/or function. Many wounds (e. g., burns, decubitus ulcers) require assistance to heal. Attempts to improve repair may be mechanical, where wound strength and barrier function is aided by a bioinert material, or a biologic approach which encourages regenerative repair. The former material must eventually be removed, but materials used for the latter are often deficient in mechanical strength, availability, or which are immunogenic or cytotoxic. We will develop a wound sealant composed primarily of collagen which can be gently but covalently crosslinked in situ via a proprietary catalyzed chemical reaction. Mechanical (barrier) strength will be achieved by the crosslinking of this material to itself and by direct covalent bonding to the tissue (eliminating problems with nonadherence), and it will provide a biocompatible (bioconductive) transition matrix for cellular infiltration and regenerative replacement. Time release antibiotics and growth factors can be included to lessen infection and speed healing. Flexibility in formulation and simplicity of design will allow widespread application in veterinary and human medical and dental practice.",

        "abstract": "Measurement of antibody binding to their specific antigen by direct electrochemical transduction has great potential as an analytical technique in the health care area. However, antibody-antigen interactions are difficult to detect due to the subtlety of the signal (no new product generated). AC impedance spectroscopy is a promising, but underdeveloped technique. We will explore this technique in basic detail; we will use a combination of antigen with three forms of a monoclonal antibody: whole IgG, whole IgG conjugated with colloidal gold and F(ab)2 fragments of IgG. Changes in the capacitance of the heterostructure upon complexing of antigen to the antibodies will be compared to that of the immobilized antibodies alone, using three electrode impedance measurement. The specificity of the surface changes observed (specific binding activity) will be assessed by simultaneous DC resistivity measurements of antibody recognition reactions, while minimizing or negating non-specific interferences. In turn, this will allow simplification of the instrumentation required, permitting the construction of practical direct biosensors in Phase II study. The development of biosensors utilizing biorecognition probes will have broad applicability in many areas, including health care, food quality control and detection of environmental contaminants.",

        "abstract": "A new class of artificial heart-type devices is emerging that offers the potential of practically unlimited patient mobility and a near-normal lifestyle for the recipient. The new devices being developed are totally implantable, self-contained, electrically driven systems. However, the power and energy density requirements of the new devices are very large and are at the limit, or exceed, the best battery technologies available today. The objective of this project is to determine the feasibility of using a lightweight, high power density, fuel cell system supplied with pure hydrogen fuel and oxygen from the air, as the external electrical power source for these new devices. The fuel cell power supply has been designed to provide 1 A for 0.4 seconds at 12 V, followed by 2.6 A for 0.2 seconds at 12 V, i. e., for an average power of 18 W over a time period of ten hours. Hydrogen fuel generation and storage, as well as an emergency back-up source of hydrogen fuel, have been considered. Unique approaches for the fabrication and validation of each component of the novel fuel cell external electrical power source for artificial heart-type devices have been devised. The system will be extremely lightweight, energy-efficient, reliable and safe.",

        "abstract": "The Army has identified a need for fluctuating flowfield density measurements over a wide range of velocities. We propose to employ a new non-intrusive optical diagnostic technique which is applicable over a Mach number range from subsonic to hypersonic. The method is based on spectially filtered rotational Raman scattering and uses a newly developed ultraviolet solid state laser system, in conjuction with an atomic mercury vapor filter at 254.7 nm. The filter is used yo block elastic and Rayleigh scattering, and transmit rotational Raman scattering. The use of an ultraviolet laser, and atomic vapor filter (as opposed to conventional spectrometer), results in significantly greater sensitivity than that of traditional vibrational Raman scattering. Modeling calculations indicate a potential density accuracy of +/- 1% at mean densities as low as 0.002 amagat. In this effort we propose a detailed study, including laboratory proof-of-concept measurements. An isotopically pure Hg vapor filter will be constructed, and its absorption characteristics determined. The study will employ a new, state-of-the-art, injection-seeded, frequency tripled, pulsed titanium-sapphire laser system. Extension to flow velocity and temperature measurement will also be explored.",

Sequencing by hybridization (SBH) is a method in which a target DNA is sequenced by separate hybridization to a large number of short oligos [1]. We will develop a novel simultaneous multiple oligonucleotide synthesizer (SMOS) capable of synthesizing tens of thousands of oligos, such as all possible 8-mer oligos (65,536) needed to perform the SBH on unknown target DNAs. The proposed manually operated multiple oligonucleotide synthesizer will be capable of synthesizing all 8-mer oligos in as little as 3 days on a 0.05 micromole scale. We will develop methods to simultaneous blot arrays of the 8-mer oligos onto hybridization membranes measuring less than six square inches. These membranes will be used to develop SBH methods that can be performed in an ordinary laboratory without expensive equipment. The SBH method will reduce the cost of sequencing DNA substantially and lend itself to simplified automation. Actual sequencing work will be carried out in Phase II during which we will optimize sequencing protocols and devise data interpretation algorithms. We will also develop a simple software program for a desk top computer that recognizes data from digitally scanned autoradiographs, translates this data into oligo sequences, and reconstructs target sequences from hybridization data.",

These tests should be performed in situ since many of the contaminants are volatile. In addition, some of the sites are contaminated with radioactive waste, making in-site detection of contaminants difficult because the detectors become damaged by the radioactivity. Also, disposing of radioactive samples brought to the surface for analysis may be difficult. Monitoring of waste sites is important to determine which sites pose a health hazard as well as to determine which remediated sites no longer pose one. A device which uses a laser for the detection of the contaminant and fiber optics for the transport of the signals to and from the sample will be discussed in this proposal.

Data will be collected to verify performance capabilities and will be provided in a final evaluation report. A tremendous commercial potential exists, and Mainstream has already committed funds for a Phase III comimercialization of the hardware.",

This waste water will be produced by a second stage nitrogen tetroxide vapor scrubber system to be used in series with current sodium hydroxide/water vapor scrubbers. This new Stage II system will use a blend of sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfite in water as the scrubbing liquors and produce waste waters containing high concentrations of nitrate and mixtures of nitrates and sulfates. Mainstream's treatment system should produce an effective economical process to treat these waste waters and produce sodium hydroxide for reuse in the system and provide a detoxified by-product that would be suitable for use as a liquid fertilizer. The Phase I effort describes the development of the required chemistry and processes for neutralizing and detoxifying the waste waters and preliminary design of the associated process hardware. The Phase II effort would consist of the design, fabrication, and demonstration testing of the pilot scale process developed in Phase I. The Phase III effort would demonstrate the process operation prototype, full scale hardware, interfaced with a selected on-site operation.",

This project seeks to design essentially wireless electrode recording systems that use radio frequency telemetry to transmit the biopotential signal from the recording site to a body-worn transceiver and then to a remotely located receiver. The present subcontractor has developed transceiver and receiver technology that will be reviewed and customized as needed for the present application. The focus here will be on developing a generic design for the sensor subsystem (\"telectrodes\"), to include the transducer interface with the skin, miniaturized amplifier and filter circuitry, an optimal connection between the transducers providing differential inputs to the amplifier, a long-lasting but compact battery, and transmitter.

        "abstract": "Noninvasive diagnostic tests of the function of internal organs are of great value to clinical diagnoses. With respect to pancreatic function, the 72-hr fecal fat test is the \"gold standard\". However, due to the problematic compliance when used as an outpatient test, the high cost when hospitalization is required, and the time required to obtain results, this test is not normally in the battery of tests used in clinical practice. We are developing a breath test for fat malabsorption which is based on the detection of 13-CO2 in the breath after the ingestion of a 13C-labeled fatty substrate. This concept was based on previous studies using 14-CO2, but this new test involves the detection of the nonradioactive isotope of carbon - Carbon- 13. During Phase I, we shall develop a breath test similar to that for fat malabsorption, but the test will be more specific for pancreatic dysfunction. This test is based on the differential excretion of 13-CO2 from either a labeled triglyceride substrate or a labeled fatty acid substrate. Thus, the test measures pancreatic function by assessing the amount of pancreatic lipase present in the gut. The feasibility will be determined by documenting the response to the test using healthy adult volunteers as well as patients with clinically diagnosed pancreatic dysfunction. Although the sample size will be small during Phase I, the results should indicate its overall feasibility and allow us to determine whether or not the concept should be further developed into a more comprehensive series of clinical trials during Phase II.",

General purpose neural network chips (eg Intel's 80170NX, 45mm by 45mm, 1.5W in active mode) are commercially available for prototyping real-time (3 microseconds/layer) neural filters for image fusion. therefore, the production model, which will be one or more special purpose chip(s), is expected to be small and energy-frugal, making it ideal for military and commercial applications.",

Systems currently in development (the PEM fuel cell and the aluminum-oxygen semi-cell) present an engineering challenge for scale-down to fit the 21 inch (and smaller) hull diameters for these applications. MATSI proposes to develop a zinc-sodium chlorate system, using an ultr-high specific energy (450 wh/kg) zinc-oxygen technology the company has developed under a NASA contract, in combination with sodium chlorate oxygen delivery technology developed by NUWC. MATSI's zinc-oxygen technology uses a lightweight, efficient, safe zinc electrode (similar to that used in consumer alkaline batteries), a high performance fuel-cell type oxygen electrode, and lightweight plastic cell frames. The system has no moving parts, and because of its high thermal efficiency, only passive modes of heat transfer (free convection and conduction) are required for thermal management. The preliminary estimate or a 19 inch clear hull diameter, is a 110 kWh system, weighing 800 pounds, and occupying 9 cubic feet (55 inches of hull length). The Phase I effort includes a detailed system design study, and delivery of a 10 cell, half-scale, 4 kWh demonstration battery for testing at NUWC.",

However, the use of animals and their maintenance is becoming increasingly costly. Animal testing suffers from subjectivity, high variability, and the flaw of applying data obtained with animals to humans persists. In addition, there is increasing public opinion that favors reduction or elimination of animal subjects for any cosmetic, industrial, or medical testing. Thus, non-animal, \"in vitro\" alternative tests are being sought. We will model dermal irritation and inflammation using normal human epidermal keratinocytes which have been cultured to form a highly differentiated, stratified epidermis-like tissue. By measuring the release of the molecular mediators which start the physiological cascade leading to dermal irritation in vivo , it is hypothesized that this \"in vitro\" system could predict the dermal irritancy potential of a particular compound. This system will allow one to accomplish this in a rapid, cost effective, and reproducible manner without the use of laboratory animals.",

The techniques currently implemented at ALTAIR and other KWR radars do not reflect the advances in ionospheric modeling and sensor technology that hve become available during the last ten years. This proposal formulates an innovative advanced development program to upgrade these techniques and maximize radar tracking accuracy. The proposed work will analyze the capabilities of the most advanced low-latitude ionospheric model ---SLIM, FAIM, ICED, and PRISM -- for use in ALTAIR range and elevatio corrctions. Because significant spatial and temporal fluctuations of the ionosphere cannot be predicted by any model, a concept is developed to update the ionospheric model in real-time using a sensor integration approch which uses the capabilities made available by the Global Positioning Systms (GPS).",

Aerodynamic heating will be computed using a hybrid grid code designed for store separation. Structural heating may create special issues that must be included. If the structure is pinned or clamped, heating may induce high stress states. In addition, high structural temperatures may cause functional failure of operational portion of the vehicle. If infrared sensors are employed, the shock layer temperatures around the vehicle and the structural temperature field may be sufficiently high that the sensors are adversely affected and may even be inoperative. In order to solve this interdisciplinary problem, it is proposed that the coupled fluid dynamic, structural, heat conduction code development be carried out by using a parallel environment on engineering workstations. Several parallel computing environments will be examined for efficiency and ease of use as well as the portabtlity to large massively parallel systems. The final goal will be a coupled code to solve a class of interdisciplinary problems on either a parallel environment using workstations across a network or a massively parallel system.",

The geometry of the foot and ankle does not accommodate the use of a large cylindrical coil surrounding the anatomy without penalty of inferior image quality in comparison to an optimized anatomically-specific coil. The coil system will provide superior SNR due to the innovation of creating a QD configuration which optimizes coil filling factor and an array version for simultaneous data acquisition.

        "abstract": "Current oscillometric blood pressure monitors applied to neonates and children are primarily developed from extension and modification of an empirically based fixed ratio algorithm used in adults. However, because the fixed ratio algorithm does not count for patient specific arterial compliance and pressure waveform, the accuracy and reliability of the pressure measurement are still limited by variations of patient circulatory physiology from newborn infants to children. A key to addressing this problem is found in a physiologically based oscillometric method for noninvasive arterial pressure measurement; this method utilizes patient specific physiological information (compliance and waveform) from the same oscillogram as measured by the current oscillometric devices. Since the new method will incorporate physiological variation with a pressure measurement algorithm, accuracy and reliability of blood pressure values should be increased in proportion to the decreased influence of the physiological variations. Since the new method uses the same oscillogram information as the current oscillometric devices to calculate pressure values, it is logical to develop a new algorithm. The new algorithm will be based on the current device hardware, and we will upgrade its software in order to achieve the benefit of the new method while retaining the advantages of hardware design and operation strategy for the current devices. Therefore, reducing the cost for the new product development. It is, therefore, proposed to test and verify the expected improvement in accuracy and reliability of pediatric pressure measurement by applying the physiologically based oscillometric method.",

This project will produce prototypes of a dry disposable head assembly and an ergonomically modified power pack which are manufacturable within economic constraints and satisfy design requirements identified by users in rehabilitative environments. Of particular significance is the safety, portability, flexibility and current widespread use (over 36,000 worldwide) of the patented Medi-Ject systems, plus it is approved for insulin and lidocaine. The Medi-Jector EZ uses an internal spring for pressure and requires no outside power, batteries or gas cartridges. Settings, with audio and visual calibrations, provide the pulse pressure and dosage adjustments. Med:-Ject's devices are mechanically unique and advantageous with respect to peak pressure routinely possible (16,000 psi), pressure flexibility (2,500 - 16,000 psi with 14 pressure levels), pressure adjustment possible without disassembling of device, and safety of medicament loading (no exposed needles). Subsequent phases will produce the modified devices, as well as educational support, for application in rehabilitation settings.",

        "abstract": "BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guerin), an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis that is used in viable form to vaccinate humans against tuberculosis, offers a number of unique advantages for development as a multivalent vaccine vehicle. Recently, versatile vectors for the expression of heterologous proteins in recombinant BCG (rBCG) have been developed. To further improve the immunogenicity of heterologous antigens in rBCG, we have constructed new rBCG expression vectors employing sequences encoding mycobacterial lipoproteins to effect in vivo acylation and export of recombinant antigens to the surface of rBCG. Others had previously shown that acylation can enhance the humoral and cellular responses to various proteins. Preliminary results with the recombinant lipoprotein antigen OspA of Borrelia burgdorferi show that the fusion-lipoprotein vectors can effect the desired biochemical modifications and immune response enhancement for this protein. To further test this system, we will construct BCG recombinants expressing the highly conserved P6 lipoprotein of Hemophilus influenzae, a demonstrated target for protective antibodies. These studies will provide useful insight into the potential for rBCG as a live vaccine vehicle for the fusion- lipoprotein approach, and the studies will yield a new candidate vaccine for disease caused by both type b and unencapsulated H. influenzae.",

        "abstract": "The frequency and severity of medical malpractice claims, and the resultant cost to the health care system, has been increasing steadily since the l97Os. Research has revealed that poor communication between health care providers and health care consumers is a significant cause of the crisis. This problem is particularly acute in cases of breast cancer, where alleged delay in diagnosis is a leading cause in both frequency and severity of claims. Studies indicate that providing women with information about their breast cancer will significantly decrease the risk of a malpractice claim. Although patients are currently provided with such information, it is usually a printed tract or a lecture from a health care provider. This information is rarely retained, and so the claims continue. In Phase I, MVI will develop a multi-media prototype designed to teach the target audience about breast cancer, which will lead them to a better understanding of the risks, the diagnostic limitations and the management possibilities for their condition. Ultimately, we hope to create a comprehensive risk management education product which will target both health care providers and patients, improving communication and decreasing claims of medical malpractice.",

A new fabrication process for sapphire domes is proposed to reduce the cost of grinding from a scooped dome blank to a prepolished stage by 20 to 30 percent. Specialized sapphire grinding tools and abrasives will be integrated with the high speed, statistically controlled CIM prototype system currently in use at the University of Rochester. The OPTICAM System had already demonstrated a 20 to 30 percent reduction in the fabrication times for several common glasses. A new fabrication process for grinding a saphire dome to a prepolished condition will be developed and tested. We seek to prove that a similar time reduction can be achieved in sapphire. A second sapphire dome will be fabricated from a scooped blank to the same accuracy using conventional methods. These times will be used as a baseline for evaluation of the high speed technique.",

        "abstract": "Many Air Force base operations produce wastewater streams containing dissolved volatile and nonvolatile organics, suspensed solids, emulsified oils, and dissolved metal ions. Discharge of these streams, untreated, to the municipal sewer is increasingly unacceptable. Dissolved volatile organic compunds (VOCs) are the principal problem; their removal would usually make the water dischargeable. MTR is developing a technology that combines air stripping, to remove VOCs from water, with membrane vapor separation, to remove the VOCs from the resulting air stream. In this program, we propose to use a batch jet aeration unit controlled by a microprocessor for the air-stripping step. This unit will be more resistant to fouling by suspended solids and emulsified oils than the packed column aeration system used to date. Also, by adjusting the timing of the aeration cycle, the degree of VOC removal and the volume flow of the stream treated can be controlled. This is important in applications at Air Force bases, where the composition and flow of water to the unit may vary over a wide range. The overall technical feasibility of the approach will be tested in Phase I. A proof-of-concept pilot system will be built and demonstrated in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Social work agencies serving the mentally ill are seeing an increasing percentage of seriously mentally ill persons with multiple needs in non-clinical areas like housing, income, behavior, and employment. An accurate and thorough assessment of these needs is required if agencies are to effectively serve the mentally ill. Using innovative computer technology, called \"expert systems,\" we collaborated with the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation to build a computer system called ASAP which assists direct service staff in assessing non-clinical needs. Several MH agencies in California would like to adapt ASAP to their settings. However, an expanded assessment model and a more flexible computer representation of the model is required to allow easy adaptation. The research will test the completeness and flexibility of an expanded assessment model and the adequacy of a representation technique for a new system called the Case Manager's Assistant (CMA) which could be adapted to any setting in which basic human needs are assessed. The research design reflects the state of the art for the validation of expert systems in practice. By including a quasi-experimental methodology (replicated single subject design), it can advance research in this area.",

Extravasations of intravenous fluids in children can have serious consequences when gross extravasations occur. Skin necrosis can occur which may require treatment with skin grafting. These adverse sequelae are infre- quently in the adult patient, but in newborns and young children they are much more prevalent and can be catastrophic. The research is intended to evaluate newly available Passive Microwave Radiometry (PMR) technology as a modality for early detection of extravasation events in children. The PMR technique is passive, non-invasive and measures subcutaneous tissue temperatures. Emphasis will be placed on optimizing the transducer(antenna) element for the injection site anatomy and tissue characteristics normally encountered for the neonatal and pediatric patient. In-vivo experiments, using an appropriate animal model, will be used to evaluate the ability of the system to distinguish between normal IV infusions and extravasated infusions. The performance data collected in the program will be used to develop the transducer into a sterile, disposable element in the follow-on Phase II effort. In addition, data collected to distinguish between normal and extravasated infusions will be used to implement an embedded microcontroller based monitor.",

        "abstract": "Human bone marrow can be transplanted into sheep fetuses when administered in utero. Upon birth of the sheep, the human hematopoietic stemcells produce differentiated human blood cells in the lymphoid erythroid and myeloid lineages for at least two years. Thus, the sheep/human chimera is an important clinical model for human stem cell (HSC) transplantation. The lack of recombinant sheep growth factors poses a major limitation to optimizing the growth of human cells in sheep transplants. One would like to manipulate blood levels of erythropoietin (Epo) to experimentally control red blood cell proliferation and differentiation; however, substantial quantities of pure sheep Epo are not available for injection. Readily available recombinant sheep Epo would contribute significantly to hemopoietic reconstitution studies in this valuable transplantation model. Since our group has considerable experience with the molecular genetics of Epo and its receptor, we will test the feasibility of cloning sheep Epo by determining the optimal probe available for detecting sheep Epo sequences, obtaining genomic clone of the sheep Epo gene and partial sequenced for cDNA cloning, identifying tissues expressing high levels of Epo mRNA (fetal liver and kidney, adult anemic kidney), and generating cDNA for PCR or expression-library cloning.",

This approach requires much time and effort to develop purified, high affinity antibodies, yet these assays are relatively insensitive. Additionally, these assays cannot distinguish biologically inactive molecules from active ones. The recent cloning of many growth factor receptors in our lab and others permits a new approach to cytokine assays. Using the hormone-binding exoplasmic domains of cytokine receptors instead of antibodies in traditional assays would allow for identification and quantitation of biologically-active receptor binding molecules. In addition to the greater specificity of receptor-based assays, this approach is easily generalizable to all receptor ligands. In Phase I, we will test the feasibility of preparing a soluble receptor-based assay for erythropoietin. Our preliminary data indicate that recombinant murine soluble Epo receptor (solEpoR) binds Epo as demonstrated by growth inhibition of an Epo dependent cell line, HCD-57.

        "abstract": "Due to both the rapid growth of genomic data and the inherent complexity and variability of its biological significance, automated pattern recognition is critical for efficiently identifying structural and functional relationships in the genomic databases that can be used to develop effective disease therapies, drugs, and other biotechnology products. However, current analytic techniques for pattern analysis are limited in their ability to identify significant structural and functional relationships because interpretation of DNA/RNA patterns is required simultaneously on several levels: linear sequence of elements, structural interactions between distant elements, structural motifs, and function. Each of these levels interacts with other levels in complex ways with especially strong linkages in the sequence/structure domains. Initial efforts with neural networks have been encouraging, but fundamental extensions of network-based techniques are needed. In particular, there are several techniques that are needed: (1) the interactions between distant elements of a sequence require that networks have a form of \"memory\"; (2) the very large number of different pattern classes requires a form of adaptive encoding of the underlying sequential information; (3) the multiple levels of interaction of the structural and functional information require the use of more complex architectures involving multiple, interacting networks; and (4) the broad range of pattern sizes and degree of allowed variability within different pattern types require that information presented to the pattern-recognition algorithm be more robust than simple sequence data. The research addresses each of these concerns by the use of modified back-propagation algorithms that allow adaptive sequence encoding and maintenance of sequence memory, by the use of coupled networks, and by the use of both linear and quadratic transforms of the raw sequence data.",

        "abstract": "Management Communications and Control Incorporated (MCCI) proposes development of an innovative approach to acoustic signal full spectrum direction finding. The approach is based on describing full spectrum signal arrival structure as a distribution of energy about a single spatial frequency. Spatial frequency is defined as the wave number of a reference frequency and reference array sensor pair. Wave numbers of all spectral components of the signal are normalized to the spatial frequency. Their sum is the spatial frequency power density. Development of three complimentary non-conventional techniques for resolving full spectrum spatial frequency power density are proposed: (1) Super CODAR, a signal subspace decomposition direction-finding method; (2) steered covariance beamforming; and (3) open loop adaptive sidelobe cancelled split beam correlation. While the proposed methods are sub-optimum, they offer superior array gain to spatially resolve the full spectrum of signals from directional interference. Further, because temporal phase is demodulated from spatial frequency observations, processing may be extended over greater time and bandwidth apertures limited by spatial frequency stability considerations only. Spatial frequency power density estimates may be tracked, displayed as time, bearing, power histories and smoothed with existing methods. Bearing sorted spectra associated with a spatial frequency track are displayed and smoothed to form unambiguous track sorted target PSDs. MCCI proposes development of Phase I kernel algorithms using the Processing Graph Method (PGM). Algorithms will be executable on MCCI's laboratory signal processing system and Navy commercial and standard resources. Phase I PGM implementation will support transition of algorithms to a commercial software and hardware system supporting PGM.",

In the early stages of the program we will assess the dynamic environment and develop a set of goals/requirements for subsonic and supersonic compressed weapon carriage systems. The goal is a compact configuration where many low drag stores can be carried within a volume constrained weapons bay, on pylon mountings, or housed within a low profile under wing conformal pod. Trade off analyses will be performed on analyzing and defining the folding mechanism design for control surfaces and fixed wings and surveying the types of materials best suited for each design. Preliminary studies have shown that potential folding mechanism concepts exist which not only satisfy the requirements for compressed volume carriage, but also offer substantial potential missile performance improvements in terms of standoff range and terminal accuracy. These potential system level performance improvements will be a consideration during the conceptual trade studies, in addition to the folding mechanism design requirements. The final result will be a preliminary design for both fixed and control surfaces for subsonic and supersonic compressed weapon carriage systems providing extremely low parasitic drag performance.",

To halt the damage, regulations (i.e., U.S. Clean Air Act of 1990) were created that prohibit emission of these refrigerants into the atmosphere. These regulations have created a need for refrigerant recovery and recycle systems. However, units avilable today are limited in their capabilities. Most are unable or ill-suited to cope with refrigerants of unknown or different phases. They can also be: slow and complicated to use, heavy, expensive, and unable to meet recent EPA regulations regarding recovery unit vacuum pressures.

The proposed unit will be modular, light-weight, cost-effective, easy to use, and able to meet EPA, ARI, and UL specifications for recycle and recovery units.

The SAW devices respond in seconds to exposure to a vapor challenge. SAW sensors can be conveniently used as dosimeters, provided the selected coating interacts irreversibly with the toxic vapor (e. g., glutaraldehyde). Hydrazines, such as dinitrophenyl hydrazine, will be investigated as the active coatings for glutaraldehyde detection. Because of their solid state construction and compatibility with integrated electronics, they have many advantages over currently available personal monitors for toxic vapors. They have the potential to be very small, rugged, low cost, and easily manufactured detection systems. Once the basic personal monitor has been developed, its capability can be readily extended to other toxic vapors simply by the design and selection of suitable interactive coatings for those vapors.",

        "abstract": "The development of improved implantable devices and biomaterials requires knowledge of their in vivo behavior. However, little is known about the actual loads borne by implanted devices in vivo. Direct measurement of these loads would provide extremely valuable information for the improvement of device designs and rapid rehabilitation of individuals with implanted devices. Multi-channel telemetry systems, combined with strain gauges, can provide this information. Miniaturized, implantable, wireless transmitters provide several advantages over conventional hard wiring: freedom from the constraints of wires, reduced risk of infection, and less discomfort for animal subjects. Long term telemetered monitoring also produces higher quality data from each subject, which can reduce the number of animals required for statistical analysis. We will to produce multi-channel strain gauge telemetry systems capable of reliable, long term implantation. Highly integrated microelectronic components will be utilized to produce low power, pulse width modulated transmitters. A microprocessor based receiver will demodulate, display, and store the telemetered data. Phase I is focused on the electronics with the production of working well tested prototypes. Phase II includes hermetic packaging, transcutaneous powering, and in vivo testing of an FDA approved spinal implant. An immediate demand for these new systems from universities, medical schools, and pharmaceutical companies is anticipated.",

The accumulator phase information is applied to a ROM in order to convert the phase information into a digitized in order to convert the phase information into a digitized sine waveform. The digitized wave is applied to a D/A converter and a low pass filter to generate the final waveform. Due to finite word lengths and the physical limitations of the architecture, phase and amplitude noise spurs are introduced during this process. Increasing the word lengths can reduce the noise spurs by about 6 db. per bit. What is proposes is two innovations that could reduce the noise spurs by more than 6db. per bit and thereby enhance the spectral purity of the generated waveform. To accomplish this the research proposes the use of: 1) New number systems with certain more desirable properties. 2) Approximation theory involving reduced computad computations.",

A facial thermogram is a high-resolution temperature map of the face surface. It is obtained by use of a camera which is sensitive to infrared emissions rather than to visible light. The face contains anatomical features which are unique to the individual, which produce characteristic patterns referred to as \"elemental shapes\" in the thermogram. The characteristic patterns differ extensively from individual to individual; even identical twins have different thermograms. This biometric technique, patented by MIKOS, offers a totally passive, non-contact, identification at a distance capability.

Since one solid state three-terminal amplifier can deliver less than a Wattat these frequencies, the outputs of several devices must be combined to achieve the power levels desired. Conventional power combining circuits become expensive and ineffecient for large numbers of devices. However, spatial power combining via quasioptical techniques improves efficiency by replacing much of the transmission line with lenses and feeds, thus allowing arrays with many amplifiers to give a net power increase. Our study will include practical tradeoffs of a quasioptical power combiner having an output power goal of 10-100W in the millimeter wave range. The study will include improved lenses, feeds and planar media giving optimum efficiency, size, weight, thermal performance, impedance matching and manufacturability. Phase I will comprise a goal definition and block diagram followed by a study of tradeoffs in packing density, area, volume, antennas and amplifier transmission media. The prototype we design in Phase I will be built in Phase II.

Many versions of Unix are available and only a few are considered to be secure thus requiring security functionality to be implemented in the IEW application. The idea of the toolkit is to move the required security functionality out of the application and the operating system, regardless of the targeted version of Unix. A well-defined and controlled interface to the toolkit will be implemented using object-oriented techniques. Interaction with the toolkit is restricted to this interface. The toolkit interface and behavior will always remain the same, only its internals may change in order to port the toolkit to another platform. The advantage of this object-oriented approach is that it forces the application to access the toolkit through a well-defined, controlled interface, thus isolating the application from the Unix operating system.",

Minimum terrestrial background radiation in the SBUV band enables the communication links to be operated at very low power levels day or night. Communication between aircraft during aerial refueling missions is currently limited to sub-desirable techniques when radio silence conditions are required.

If this program is successful, the 94 GHz radiation could be used as a wiggler field for a second stage interaction that could generate powerful, coherent IR radiation. However, a very high quality electron beam is required for the second stage of the FEL. During Phase I, we propose to use detailed measurements of the electron beam quality on THOR (both voltage flatness, which is determined largely by the Marx circuitry, and beam emittance, which is controlled by the beam diode and transport system) along witgh FEL simulations to quantify the degree of improvement that is required. Modifications to the Marx will be analyzed using a SPICE model. Beam diode modifications will be guided by numerical simulations, using MAGIC and E-Gun. The designs will maintain compatibility with an optimized two-stage or dual-mode FEL that can couple out either the first stage output (millimeter wave) or the second stage output (IR).

One of the important remaining problems is that of obtaining or producing multi-spectral signatures for the expendables or decoys. Currently, separate expendable devices are needed if the threat sensor type is unknown or multi-spectral. A few recent Air Force programs have pursued the idea of obtaining RF, IR and laser (EO) signatures from a single decoy, but the technology is still in the developmental state, and some of the concepts result in a mechanically complex device. The approach proposed here is different in that exiting flare technology will be used as the baseline or starting point, and the RF signature will be obtained by modifying the flare materials that generate or enhance the RF scattering that a measurable (but small) RCS is generated by conventional flares. Other experimental work has shown that seeding the flare material with compounds such as Cesium will increase the concentration of free electrons in the flare plume, which can result in increased RCS levels.",

Mnemonics has assembled an experienced team, familiar with the hardware and software necessary to efficiently evaluate the capability to integrate the HSFB and SIDS into the MATT. Collectively, we understand the MATT hardware, the HSFB system, and the applications software necessary to receive, decompress, and display the SIDS data. The team, consisting of Mnemonics and Information Technology and Applications Corporation (ITAC), in conjunction with SOCOM shall evaluate the alternative hardware and software solutions and the corresponding risks associated with each choice and provide a cost effective solution to the implementation of the HSFB and SIDS. Alternative configurations shall be studied to help span the range of performance and reliability versus cost. The results of the Phase I effort shall be preliminary design representing the choice(s) for best implementing the SIDS and HSFB capabilities into MATT, providing MATT users with new features without the need for the development of a new platform.",

However, advanced in wafer cleaning and photoresist processing have not progressed to the point where they can be effectively integrated into the vacuum-integrated cluster-tool processor. This program outlines areas of basic research on all dry photoresist and wafer cleaning techiques which provide equal or better process performance to currently used liquid based processes. Successful development of all dry photoresist wafer cleaning techniques will have significant positive impact on the economics of vaccum-integrated cluster-tool processing and may provide a driving force for the increased use of vacuum-integrated cluster-tool processors in a manufacturing environment. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: The successful development of all dry photoresist and wafer cleaning techniques will increase the driving force of the application of vacuum-integrated cluster tool processing. Additional benefits of all dry processing include reduced contamination and reductions in the use of ultrapure water and reduce supply and disposal of hazardous liquid chemicals.",

        "abstract": "Solid state dye lasers are of considerable importance for the laser industry in general. Currently, host materials present several problems, like low stability, low damage threshold and dye degradation, which lead to a short operating life for these materials. Therefore, research with the purpose of identifying stable solid host materials that can be impregnated with laser dyes will be carried out. MTI is proposing to develop a class of guest-host materials with superior optical quality and high damage threshold to be used as solid state dye lasers. The proposed materials are based on solgel technology. The guest-host samples prepared by this process will be cured at high temperature, which will ensure that the selected dye will be locked in the three-dimensional network of the glass matrix. The developed materials will be characterized for their optical properties and damage threshold. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: The results of this research will be new materials for solid state dye lasers. Consequently, small portable dye lasers will become possible. These lasers are of considerable importance for commercial applications in the field of optical data processing and communications.",

Most of the new organic material based optical materials that are poised to replace traditional inorganic materials in this area, due to their improved optical properties and ease of fabrication, are particularly deficient in the are of environmental stability, especially temporal stability of the nonlinear optical properties at higher temperatures. We propose to demonstrate new organosilicon systems with useful nonlinear optical properties. These materials will be fabricated into thin films and their optical properties will be studied. Preliminary studies of temporal stability, particularly at higher temperatures will also be made. The Phase II effort will seek to optimize these characteristics as well as overall optical and mechanical properties.",

The design of SMA force and displacement actuators requires a fundamental knowledge of the behavior of these materials. There has been an extensive body of work focused on the development of constitutive models describing the thermomechanical response characteristics of SMA materials in monolithic form. Many applications, however, call for the embedding of SMA materials within structural components to sesnse and/or control the mechanical response of the structures. Very little work has addressed the mechanics of the interactions between the SMA elements and the host materials they are embedded within. consequently, a micromechanical approach to understanding the thermomechanical interactions between the embedded SMA and the host material is required and will be the focus of this work.

The development will take advangtage of existing development platforms and performance modeling tools to develop and demonstrate critical aspects of the design in Phase I. The first objective is to design the RWR simulation software. The J-MASS tool will be employed to design the necessary modularity and reconfigurablility and to demonstrate the design concepts. The second objective is to design the real-time computing system. Existing and proven computing system performance modeling tools and techniques will be used to design and demonstrate the real-time computing system design. The third objective is to design the overall RWR system and the fourth is to design the interfaces into a host facility. These will be accomplished through standard and tested system engineering and integration modules and designs. Through the demonstrations of modularity, reconfigurability and execution speed performance, the design will be established as both feasible and ready for direct transition into a Phase II simulator development program.",

Treatment of fungal infections is difficult due to a lack of effective antifungal antibiotics. Even after 29 years of use, Amphotericin is still the drug of choice to treat systemic fungal infections; however, amphotericin is very toxic to human cells. Other antifungal agents are limited by either a narrow spectrum of activity or by toxicity or both. One striking difference between fungal and human cells is that fungal cells are encased in a wall which protects them a hostile external environment. Human pathogenic fungi contain chitin, (1-3)-beta-glucan, other glucans, peptides, and lipids as essential components of cell walls. All available information indicates that (1-3)-beta-glucan synthase activity is very important for fungal cell-wall assembly. We will form antisense constructs of a gene that codes for an essential component of beta(1,3)glucan synthase activity. We will transform fungal cells with antisense constructs and determine the effect of expression of antisense RNA on enzyme activity and fungal growth. We expect that antisense oligonucleotides may be important, novel therapeutic agents directed specifically against fungi.",

These will then be used to develop extremely sensitive and high resolution hybridization probes. Several synthetic pathways will be explored to produce gold labelled uridine and adenine nucleotide triphosphates. Phophoramidite - gold derivatives will also be synthesized. The first set of labels will be incorporated enzymatically into nucleic acids to create gold-labelled hybridization probes. The phosphoramidite - gold labels will be utilized in automatic DNA synthesizers for the synthesis of labelled oligonucleotides. The efficiency of gold- nucleotide incorporation will be determined, and the most efficient probes will be employed in dot blots and in situ hybridization tests to localize nucleic acids in mammalian cells at high resolution. Double labelling with the 1.4 nm and 0.82 nm probes will enable the localization of two different nucleic: add sequences within the same cell. Gold labelled probes will enhance the sensitivity an order of magnitude or more over current probes. Improved penetration up to 30 micromoles into cells and tissue sections will also be realized with the new probes. Applications of this new technology should improve genetic topography studies in light and electron microscopy, Southern blotting, gene mapping and sequencing, and clinical diagnosis.",

The principal objective of this new technology is to achieve about a factor of six higher spatial resolution (1.5mm compared to 10mm) than achieved with the existing systems. We propose using the technology we have developed for detectors at the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) at Dallas, Texas. We have developed the capacity for producing scintillating plastic fibers which have good gamma ray conversion efficiency. Fibers with 1.0mm square cross section will be used to detect the X-rays with high conversion efficiency and high spatial resolution. Collimation of the X-rays is achieved using a lead collimator which is fabricated using techniques developed for the SSC. This collimator array is placed in front of the scintillating fiber X-ray converter to provide 70% X-ray transmission and about 1.5mm spatial resolution at the center of the system. The combination of novel X-ray detector and collimator system using this new SSC technology provides a significant advance in SPECT technology. With this development, SPECT can be extended into new fields of medical research and significantly improve existing methods of clinical diagnosis. In addition, it is anticipated that these technical advances can be achieved at the low costs associated with plastic technology.",

This Phase I is intended to bridge the gap between research and practice by developing smoking prevention materials for junior high school students based on the state-of-the-art in smoking prevention. The approach being tested has previously been demonstrated to reduce adolescent smoking by up to 87%. Commercially viable smoking prevention materials need to be developed to increase the potential for large-scale dissemination and utilization. Formative evaluation will be used to guide the development of high quality smoking prevention materials. Revisions based on these findings will be incorporated into the final version of the materials. This will be followed by a formal outcome evaluation during a subsequent Phase II study.

These conditions never exist in real ocean environments. In order to improve on CBF's performance, Neptune Sciences, Inc. (NSI) has developed and Inverse Beamforming (IBF) method which consists of four algorithms: 1) the Fourier Integral Method (FIM) / Fourier Series Method (FSM) beamforming, 2) noise normalization, 3) an eight nearest neighbor peak picker and 4) a three-dimensional M of N tracking algorithm. The theoretical development for each algorithm is given in detail in this proposal. The IBF method has been tested using several different data sets and has produced extremely successful results for narroband, SWATH and broadband energy detection and bearing estimation. The results have been obtained for many different arrays, including a real-time experiment on board a US submarine during RANGEX 1-92. NSI proposes to take this innovative and successful theory, apply it to Navy supplied data from the Fixed Distribution System (FDS), the FDS Deployable (FDSD), or the Advanced Deployable System (ADS) and compare the IBF methods' performance to a baseline performance selected by the Navy.",

All data collection modes and collection parametners are completely configurable, allowing any type of physiologic instrument to be emulated. The use of appropriate transducers can also allow recording and analysis of sleep, respiration, motion (kinesiology, ergonomic studies), intestinal motility and pH, and cardiac rhythm. The specific aims of Phase I are to port this instrument to run on a Laptop (80486) PC. Powerful generic data analysis capabilities existing within the current system will be proted to the PC as well. This will provide the basis for the Phase II development of an add-on box, which can be attached to the PC and will contain battery- powered analog amplifiers, stimulators, completing the instrument. Suitable analog technology will be investigated in Phase I, to allow a preliminary design for the box to be prepared.",

        "abstract": "Searches of free text databases depend on the keywords used in the request for information. If keywords are extracted from the user's query and no use is made of synonyms, relevant data in the database may be overlooked. The same can be the case if class-subclass, and part-whole information is ignored. The semantic network WordNet that has been developed a Princeton University encodes a very rich store of semantic information concerning relationships between words that are used constantly in any language understanding. These include subordinate-superordinate and part-whole information, as well as refinements to them, restrictions of relationships to appropriate contexts and mappings between words of different categories (nouns, adjectives, verbs). It is envisioned that uses of the relationships encoded in WordNet can allow the computer to make deductions allowing it to determine that many texts are relevant to the needs that a user expressed in quite different terms. Netrologic proposes to develop a system to categorize articles based on concepts encoded in WordNet, and to create a free text database interface to search documents categorized in this way. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: The efficient determination of all documents in a database relevant to a user's needs is becoming increasingly important, as larger and larger free text databases are coming in line. A system that contains an embedded semantic network can be an invaluable aid to everyone in both government and the general public who will be making extensive uses of large databases.",

The long term aim is to provide a therapy which enhances the analgesic properties of opioids in opioid-tolerant patients who are not receiving adequate pain relief. In animal experiments, concurrent administration of dynorphin A(1-13) has been shown to potentiate morphine-induced analgesia in rodents tolerant to morphine and to suppress the expression of withdrawal. Preliminary studies in opioid-medicated patients have shown that dynorphin can be administered safely and enhance pain relief. This project is a pilot study to evaluate the ability of dynorphin A (1- 13) to enhance the analgesic effect of morphine (or hydromorphone) in patients requiring relatively high doses of these opioids. Results from three treatment groups will be compared: 1) a single dose of an established opioid dose, 2) a single dose of 50% of an established opioid dose and a low dose of dynorphin A, and 3) a single dose of 50% of an established opioid dose and a high dose of dynorphin A. Patients will self-assess pain intensity, pain relief, and mood prior to, and at designated intervals after medication. The study will be conducted by an experienced pain research group at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center under an existing NTI-sponsored IND.",

We have identified additional problems with the consistency of the applied stimulus. This effort is concerned with the creation of an enhanced pressure esthesiometer that corrects all the aforementioned problems. That is, the new device is being engineered to hold calibration, to have correct relevant norms, to be portable, to be much less fragile, to slip less, and additionally, to sell at a comparable price.

Neural network based supervised learning algorithms and hardware provide a beneficial tool for reducing the need for a priori knowledge of the structures behavior through rapid system identification and health monitoring on-line. Furthermore, the combined use of neural networks and optimal control presents a stochastic nonlinear learning control architecture that provides the ability to rapidly adapt on-line to uncertainty in the structure's behavior. Under an existing program from McDonnell Douglas Aerospace, NeuroDyne is applying internally developed decentralized learning optimal control tools to active vibrational damping of \"smart\" composite aircraft structures. In Phase I, our team will leverage this research to further develop and apply real-time system identification and learning optimal control for control/structural interaction (CSI) of the Phillips Laboratory Planar Articulating Controls Experiment (PACE) test bed.

Aircraft flight and propulsion control systems are traditionally designed to operate independently of each other. This method often results in a system where performance is compromised for robustness and operability. There exists a great need for nonlinear system identification and control approaches that can optimize on-board models for off-nominal behavior such as engine deterioration and engine-to-engine variations. NeuroDyne will team with Scientific Systems in the development of a nonlinear adaptive engine diagnostics and control method using a combination of neural network based system identification and optimal control for aircraft engines. This program will leverage an existing program funded by NASA Lewis and Dryden Research Centers which involves NeuroDyne and McDonnell Douglas in the development of a neural network based estimation component for engine efficiencies and diagnostics in the Performance Seeking Control (PSC) system.

        "abstract": "This project will develop and implement a learning controller architecture for control of complex distributed nonlinear systems with multiple localized equipment controllers and a variety of sensor feedback. The fundamental philosophy of this approach is to optimize control at a local level through the use of neural networks and optimal control techniques such as dynamic programming, and to utilize the longer term planning and optimization capabilities of optimal control to coordinate the local controllers and achieve global system optimzation. This intelligent control architecture will be implemented on an advanced scalable distributed control platform developed by Honeywell, the Advanced Equipment Controller System. This work will build upon numerous previous research and development projects in intelligent and distributed control, both by NeuroDyne Inc. and Honeywell, under funding from DARPA, NSF, NAVY, NASA, Air Force, internal R&D, and others. This will result in a flexible, intelligent, scalable, modular, adapative distributed control platform which may be easily applied to a wide variety of systems and processes. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: The potential commercial applications of this technology are as wide as the applications of industrial control itself. A proven intelligent control architecture will be implemented on an advanced Honeywell scalable controller hardware platform to provide self-configuring, self-optimizing process control which is easily adaptable to a wide variety of industrial processes in aerospace, microelectronics fabrication, chemical process control, and numerous other areas.",

Moreover, by providing an intuitive interface with context sensitive help menus, the application is expected to be useful in classroom demonstrations and provide the basis for classroom laboratory exercises. A comprehensive and yet flexible software environment designed to operate on common PC hardware platforms will ensure a broad base of users, scientists, educators and students, who in turn will assure its continued evolution into a more useful tool.

Recent breakthroughs in understanding of the mechanisms by which nervous tissue degenerates have made it possible to design therapeutic drug strategies to prevent the process. We will develop rational drug treatments for stroke and head trauma, i. e. neuroprotective drugs. The current neuroprotective drug candidates are proving not to be clinically useful due to their substantial side effects. This proposal will characterize a drug that lowers post-ischemic lactic acid levels and in so doing inhibits tissue damage. The lactate lowering agent will be tested in several animal models of stroke, and its efficacy compared to another putative neuroprotective drug. The Phase I goals are to establish the efficacy of our lead agent with special consideration given to documenting its therapeutic value when given following reperfusion. In Phase II a medicinal chemistry effort will seek to develop more potent agents which act via the same mechanism. A structure-activity relationship will be generated for these agents.

        "abstract": "The Phase I objective is to develop a 10 MHz to 65 GHz (or minimum 2 GHz to 60 GHz) coaxial noise source with a low VSWR. The noise source will use a millimeter-wave noise diode developed in 1992 (as a result of contract DAALO1-89-C-O9I6) and utilize 1-85 mm connectors. It will consist of a broadband impedance-matching section, circuitry containing the diode and DC blocking capacitors, and a temperature compensating current regulator. By using a technique, which separates the noise source into 3 sections (impedance-matching, DC blocking, and bias), attention can be paid to these basic elements of 60 GHz coaxial components. Noise sources are special by being very broadband of nature and are required to have a low VSWR in both on and off conditions. The broadband impedance-matching shall provide a constant spectral density of noise at the output, while maintaining the low VSWR as the noise diode is switched on and off, thus matching the package loss and diode impedance in these two states. It is a challenge to simultaneously obtain effective DC blocking/AC coupling at very low and very high frequencies. Successful completion of Phase I will therefore ensure useful results for development of other 60 GHz components or 110 GHz noise sources.",

During Phase I of the project, the software used by the controller will be combined with previously developed algorithms for cancelling (non-eriodic) noise. A detailed cost analysis of the targeted commercial project will be made. Several specific noisy environments of interest will be simulated in the laboratory.

        "abstract": "The long-term objectives of the proposed project include developing, validating and disseminating a reliable automated system for monitoring pressure sore status for nursing homes, hospitals and home health agencies. While pressure sores remain prevalent and costly, identification of more effective treatment and management strategies is hindered by the lack of a universal system for describing and monitoring actual pressure sore status. Pilot work has resulted in the development and validation of a reliable status evaluation and reporting system. However, the Pressure Sore Status Tool (PSST) currently only exists in paper form. Automation would not only allow for more efficient field utilization, but would also allow specific sub-analyses that would be impractical in a manual system and would ideally contribute to more effective treatment. Consequently, the Phase I project is directed toward establishing the field utility of the manual system, automating the PSST and expanding the software to allow sub-analyses, identifying necessary system modification for Phase II testing, and establishing the evaluation methodology and power requirements to address effectiveness and evaluation of the extent to which the system is universally usable. Phase II will focus on necessary system modifications, issues of efficiency and generalization and documentation of the system's effect on procedural utilization and patterns of regeneration. Phase III will focus on dissemination/ marketing the PSST to the nation's 25,000 nursing homes as well as other long term and acute care facilities and the possible establishment of a wide scale user data base [viz. registry].",

The publication will use a peer communications approach to inform parents and to constructively involve them in their child's recovery. Special edition issues will address the concerns of parents during the pre-treatment and in-treatment phases of substance abuse. An ongoing monthly publication will be used to engage and educate parents following their child's treatment. The aftercare phase is a strong predictor of treatment success. A critical part of aftercare is the type and extent of parental involvement. Service providers and educators have few tools to help them reach parents. In Phase I, a pilot magazine will be developed and produced. The issue will focus on the transition point from treatment to aftercare. The format and content of the pilot magazine will be developed in conjunction with affected parents and teenagers. The finished magazine will be distributed to parents whose children are completing treatment. An evaluation will be conducted to assess the magazine's impact on parental involvement in and information about their child's recovery. In Phase II, the special editions and ten issues of a monthly publication will be produced.",

        "abstract": "Two essential elements of any physical security system are the security sensors themselves and the communications network which interconnects them. Highly sophisticated biometric sensors which provide rapid, accurate personnel identification are currently available from several vendors and it is Nova Engineering's opinion that further development in this area does not represent the best value to the government at this time. Far more significant shortcomings exist in the area of the communications subsystem, particularly for security systems which must be frequently relocated. Wired interconnects are secure and jam resistant but are extremely labor intensive to install; this is impractical for relocatable systems. Wireless links, on the other hand, are very easy to install but existing reasonably priced receivers are easily spoofed or jammed, even unintentionally. Robust anti-jam MIL-spec transceivers, such as SINCGARS and HAVE QUICK are available, but their size, weight power consumption, and cost are all very high. This proposal describes Nova Engineering's innovative approach to mitigating these deficiencies. By combining current state-of-the-art biometric sensors with our unique Sinusoid-Free Spread Spectrum modulation, we are able to provide a low cost, high performance approach to Robust Relocatable Physical Security Systems.",

Nd:YA1G lasers are believed to display an intrinsic chaotic behavior-1 at sufficiently high pumping power. Long experimental time series from such a system will be re-examined and the reliability of the numerical estimation of the Lyapunov spectra checked against recently proposed criteria2. Some other criteria of distinguishing chaos from an \"amplified noise\"-3 will be used. An attempt will be made to obtain the chaotic regime of lasing for this laser by different means such as periodic modulation of some system parameters, radiation injection from another lasing unit and different feedback schemes -4. Being sure that the system indeed resides on a low-dimensional attractor for some of the tested regimes, we intend to reexamine the technique of stabilization of unstable periodic orbits embedded in an attractor by the occasional proportional feedback method-5 already demonstrated effective for the Nd:YA1G laser-1 in the autonomous chaotic regime. The experience from this series of experiments will be used in an attempt of controlling intrinsic and/or induced chaos in small arrays of up to four coupled CO-2 lasers. Different coupling schemes and array geometries will be used. There is a theoretical and restricted experimental evidence that at least some coupling schemes (e.g., two CO2 lasers optically coupled by a semitransparent mirror-6) are indeed chaotic and can be described by low dimensional systems of ODE's. The same as above methods of testing chaos will be used and the stabilization of the periodic orbits attempted for some of the realizations of coupled arrays.",

        "abstract": "Advanced aircraft designs require thechnology improvements that incorporate the use of advanced materials and material systems for high specific stiffness and temperature capabilities. Improved crack detection and material property measurement techniques are required to support the development and verification of material systems. A development program is proposed that will improve for high-temperature application two thermography techniques to enable the quantification of flaws both in terms of geometry and stress intensity factors. Forced Diffusion Thermography (FDT) is an NDE method that uses projected, dynamic patterns of light to thermally excite a specimen structure with an oscillating thermal pattern that is synchronously imaged and processed for the detection of flaws. Thermoelastic Stress Analysis (TSA) is a differential thermography technique capable of nearly real-time measurement of mixed-mode stress intensity factors. Both FDT and TSA use the same dynamic thermography equipment to measure the small temperature fluctuations upon which these techniques are based. FDT and TSA have several attributes that will make them superior to other methods for assessing structural integrity in exteme environments. FDT and TSA are: noncontacting full-field techniques, not significantly impaired by convection currents or other anomalies in a high-temperature environment, able to work on a wide range of materials and composites, and able to produce standard (DC) thermal images as well as differential (AC) thermal images.",

It would be desirable to have configurations that are lighter and with a higher strength to weight ratio. Composite plastic tubes have been studied but these can absorb water and suffer from delamination. This proposal describes a composite tube structure of concentric layers of beryllium (inner layer; 70% of total section), 304 stainless steel (intermediate layer; 15% of total section) and titanium (outer layer; 15% of total section). The tube will be fabricated by co-extrusion of the three principal materials held in an evacuated steel canister. After extrusion over a mandrel, the steel envelope will be removed. 9 to 15 feet of tube at approximately 2 inches O.D. x 1-3/4 inches I.D. will be formed and available for testing. Testing of the finished model tube will include tensile tests, bending tests and optical metallography and SEM inspection of the component material interfaces. Test results will indicate whether this construction has merit and what modifications may be needed to improve the structure.",

These reinforced concrete bunkers are quite often constructed below ground level and are formidable structures to defeat. Nuclear Metals, Inc. proposes a four month effort to design a depleted uranium (DU) version of the BLU-IO9/B, 2000 pound bomb. Hydrocode analyses of concrete penetration and the response of the explosive filled bomb case to penetration forces will be conducted. Iterative design and trade-off analyses are proposed beginning with the evaluation of two DU alloys: DU-.75% Ti and DU-2% Mo. Working within the current maximum weight of the BLU-IO9/B case, 1321 pounds, NMI will examine reduced diameter and increased length/diameter ratios for the bomb case. These designs will provide an increase in the depth of penetration while avoiding excessive internal pressures that would otherwise cause premature bomb detonation. An optimum design will be provided at the conclusion of Phase I along with a final technical report detailing major technical findings from the analyses. The preliminary bomb design will be suitable for fabrication of inert prototypes for test and Ovaluation in Phase II.",

A novel piezoelectric BaTiO3/superconducting YBCO/bicrystal SrTiO3 grain boundary junction is proposed to be demonstrated in this program. This hybrid junction structure in which the tunneling space between the two grains can be tuned to achieve the optima performance via stress induced by a piezoelectric layer, potentially offers a viable scheme to high performance SIS junction. Currently, an advanced materials processing technology capable of controlling the mircrostructures of HTSC thin films is desirable for both scientific evaluations and practical applications of HTSC technology. In this program we propose to develop an innovative plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition process (PE-CVD), which can potentially reduce twining by growing the orthorhombic superconducting phase in the as deposited state at low temperatures and reducing defects by suppressing the formation of impurities via a selective plasma etching technique. Moreover, PE-CVD is an attractive process due to its large-area, low temperature, high growth rate, and low cost fabrication capabilities. Phase I work will emphasize the feasibility demonstration of epitaxially growing the multilayer junction structure by the PE-CVD process.",

For a long time, device development was hindered by inadequate materials technology. However, the epitaxial growth technologies originally used for GaAs/A1GaAs materials, such as MOCVD and MBE, have now matured. Their application to the case of wide bandgap semiconductors promises solutions to many of the decades old problems. Historically, it has been impossible to produce wide gap III/V or II/VI materials with significant p-type conductivity. The proposed program utilizes a unique approach, utilizing Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition, to enhance the dopant incorporation efficiency of p-type impurities. This will allow the fabrication of blue LEDs with increased output using an approach which is better suited to mass production than the Low-Energy Electron Beam Irradiation method pioneered in Japan.",

Analysis of the APC gene has identified mutations in germ line DNA of FAP patients. Over 90% of the mutations interrupt the reading frame suggesting the presence of a truncated APC protein. We have developed a series of anti-APC antibodies directed against the amino terminal portion of APC. These antibodies have identified a truncated form of APC protein in SW480 cells carrying mutated APC alleles. We will examine a series of tumor cell lines and normal cells for altered forms of APC protein associated with the presence of colorectal cancer. We will concentrate on cell lines in which the structure of APC is known, either wild type or mutated. We will also begin generating antibodies to carboxyl terminal domains in APC that will be used to discriminate full length versus truncated APC proteins. In Phase II, the combination of anti-amino terminal and anti-carboxyl terminal APC antibodies will be used to develop an assay for determination of APC status in clinical samples as a prognostic test for FAP and colorectal cancer.",

        "abstract": "There is mounting evidence that the over-production of the lysosomal enzyme, Cathepsin D, can be a useful prognostic marker in breast cancer. Cathepsin D is synthesized as a 52 kDa precursor (pro-CD)) that is processed into the active mature form made up of 34k and 14k subunits. Although pro-CD is the form that is abnormally secreted by tumor cells, currently available assays measure the mature form and thus normal levels of endogenous enzyme may confound the interpretation of test results. An assay that is specific for the 52 kDa pro-form could prove to be a more reliable prognostic indicator for breast as well as other types of cancer. The goal is to generate monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies which specifically recognize epitopes in the pro-sequence of cathepsin D. Two peptides derived from this sequence will be synthesized and used to immunize mice and rabbits. Resulting antibodies will be used together with ones that already exist to format an ELISA for the quantitation of pro-CD. The assay will be used to evaluate a small number of sera and tumor samples from breast cancer patients.",

Recent studies suggest that EGFr positivity may be predictive of poor patient response to endocrine therapy. Studies have also shown that certain tumor cell lines release the extracellular domain (ECD) of EGFr into cell culture fluids and therefore the potential exists for the detection of EGFr in sera of cancer patients. To test this hypothesis, we have developed an ELISA specific for the ECD of EGFr that can be used to screen patient sera for positive reactivity. In Phase I, we will use the EGFr ELISA to evaluate sera from individuals with primary or metastatic breast cancer, individuals that show significantly elevated levels of EGFr above controls will be evaluated biochemically for the presence of full length or truncated versions of EGFr. Corresponding tumor tissue will be evaluated by immunohistochemistry to determine the EGFr status of the tumor. Serum reactivity and EGFr expression in the tumor will then be compared.",

DNA amplification events in solid tumors are proving to be important prognostic variables in human cancers. Development of probes to observe these amplifications utilizing fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is superior to the existing protocols (Southern blot and polymerase chain reaction, PCR) because fewer cells are required for analysis and DNA extractions are unnecessary. Cytogenetics also allows differentiation between normal and malignant cells in tumor preparations which is not possible with existing technologies. Phase I will use P1 and cosmid genomic library screening strategies to isolate clones representative of c-myc, N-myc, and L-myc oncogene sequences. When existing screening probes are insufficient to identify library clones, sophisticated PCR strategies, proven in Oncor laboratories, will allow production of additional screening probes. All cosmid or P1 genomic clones will be analyzed on normal cells by FISH for single copy integrity. Archived pathological specimens from collaborators or cancer cell lines will be used to validate detection of DNA amplification in malignant cells. Development of these probes may have a significant impact upon DNA diagnostics and current clinical studies involving oncogene amplification events in human cancers.",

To fully realize TNF's clinical activity, it will be necessary to develop more potent TNF analogues possessing fewer untoward effects. Several studies have found that TNF cytotoxicity depends on TNF internalization and processing by the cell. We compared the processing of TNF by TNF-sensitive and resistant cancer cells of breast and prostate origins. Sensitive cells were found to process internalized TNF to 15 kD and 5.5 kD species, while the resistant cell lines produced multiple lower molecular weight TNF products. We also evaluated the toxicity of conditioned medium from sensitive cells to determine if media containing the degradation products was toxic to resistant cells. Hydrophobic interaction column HPLC was employed to isolate and purify the degradation products for evaluation of their cytotoxic activity. Conditioned media and the HPLC fractions of conditioned media enriched for the 5.5 kD TNF fragment were toxic to both TNF-sensitive and -resistant tumor cells. Phase I would isolate, sequence and synthesize the 5.5 kD degradation product and assay its antineoplastic activity against fresh human tumors of various histology's. If Phase I results are encouraging, Phase II would evaluate the toxicity profile and anti-tumor action of this peptide in vivo in murine models. The ultimate goal would be to develop a new chemotherapeutic agent.",

        "abstract": "Currently, assays for MDR-1 expression are for research purposes only. This study will determine if measurement of MDR-1 expression by flow cytometry can be performed as a routine clinical assay, and if such an assay can predict the clinical response of patients treated with Taxol for ovarian cancer. Furthermore, the value of testing in vitro resistance- reversal by verapamil and cyclosporin analogue will also be assessed. Phase I will evaluate the feasibility of acquiring and testing the tissues and obtain initial data on patient outcome. Phase II will evaluate a large number of patients to test the statistical significance of these assays. Expression of MDR-1 by intrinsically drug resistant tumors such as renal, colon, adrenal, and pancreatic cancers indicates the broad spectrum of tumor types where drug resistance may be related in part to a specific drug-afflux mechanism. The notion that MDR-1 expression is clinically related to treatment failure has been supported by Salmon's group at the University of Arizona; recent clinical trials indicated that MDR reversal in refractory patients expressing MDR-1 could improve patient outcome. Both verapamil and cyclosporin have been found to sensitize patients to doxorubicin and vincristine. However, use of these reversing agents is associated with systemic toxicity, and not all drug resistant patients expressing MDR-1 will benefit from verapamil or cyclosporin treatment. To fully realize the clinical utility of MDR-resistance reversal, it will be necessary to study the relationship between MDR-1 expression and patient outcome for a large number of patients. This study will focus on the development of a clinical assay to evaluate patient tumors for MDR-1 expression, in vitro drug resistance, and resistance reversal by verapamil and cyclosporin analogue. Patients to be evaluated in Phase I are part of GOG-118 and have untreated stage 3 or 4 epithelial ovarian cancer. They will be treated on protocol GOG-132 with cisplatin, taxol or taxol plus cisplatin. Each patient specimen will be tested for MDR-1 expression by flow cytometry and histochemistry. In vitro response to cisplatin, Taxol, or the combination, in the presence and absence of verapamil and cyclosporin analogue will be determined by the Kern tritiated thymidine incorporation assay.

        "abstract": "Military weather forecasting tasks are becoming more difficult because of the increasing sophistication and weather sensitivity of modern weapon systems, and the large (and increasing) volumes of meteorological data now available to the forecasters for their analysis, especially during periods of bad weather when the demands on the humans in the loop are at a maximum. This is exacerbated by the future prospect of a decrease in the pool of qualified personnel brought about by force reductions. Furthermore, as the weapons become more complex and tactical choices multiply, the operational decision-makers will find it more difficult to deal with the increasing variety of meteorological input data that they must consider in selecting the optimum combination of weapons and tactics. In response to these challenges, the rapid growth of computational speed and memory available at a reasonable cost and in smaller physical volume, makes it possible to envision higher levels of automated data fusion and advanced visualization schemes to accomplish two objectives: (1) Reduce the amount of human intervention required for data fusion while increasing the quality of weather support; (2) Improve the speed and effectiveness of the communication of significant weather information to both the forecasters and their operational users through the use of advanced visualization techniques. We proposed to evaluate, select and develop advanced and innovative techniques for data fusion and visualization in order to develop a Meteorlogical Visualization Environment (MVE).

The technology transfer workstation will incorporate a decision support system (DSS) that will contain specific documents an data elements necessary to support management decisions concerning the selection of candidate technologies. Previous methodologies for technology transfer have focused opn educating potential markets through mainly passive means, i.e., seminars and meetings and through information transfer through informal channels. OpTech proposes to support federal laboratory managers and scientists with a structured decision support system resident on a technology transfer workstation. Technologies from the fields of R&D management, decision analysis, document imaging and retrieval systems, and legal and administrative review will be combined within the DSS. In Phase I, we will (1) review current literature on information management and technology transfer: (2) determine the informational flow requirements between internal and external agencies, (3) define mandatory DSS data elements, and (4) design a prototype workstation. The prototype DSS and workstation will be developed in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "A major obstacle to the establishment and measurement of valid cause and effect relationships between Army service and the costs and benefits of such service is the impossibility of performing experiments with random assignment of individuals to service and non-service groups. A recent innovation in statistical theory, propensity score methodology, allows one to draw from an observational (or retrospective) study virtually the same kind of causal inferences that previously have been possible only with experimental studies. Propensity score methodology has been successfully used in medical, social science, and educational contexts. Phase I will develop a specimen propensity score model of costs and benefits of Army service, will identify and specify the data sources necessary to implement and test the model, and will determine the procedures and scope of the effort needed to test the model. Phase I will include a preliminary specification of the variables appropriate for use in the final model. Attention will be given to the question of oversampling women and minorities so that separate models may be developed for them. Not only are such separate models desirable heuristically, they are also particularly appropriate when using propensity scores. Phase II will be devoted to the elaboration, detailed specification, testing, and evaluation of the model.",

        "abstract": "The northward migration from Brazil of the Africanized honey bee (AHB), Apis mellifera scutellata, following their accidental release presents a new U. S. public health concern. Because of the AHB's extremely defensive colony behavior, persons may be attacked by swarms; this will result in hundreds to thousands of stings. In these instances, potentially lethal quantities of venom are delivered (similar to snakebite); there is not a commercial antivenom available to neutralize toxicity. It is projected that up to 6,000 individuals annually will receive serious stings in the U. S. following establishment of feral populations. We will develop an AHB antivenom using proprietary methods for the production of pharmaceutical-grade polyclonal antibodies from hyperimmune hen eggs. High-purity avian antivenoms have been shown to have superior venom-neutralizing capabilities when compared to conventional mammalian products and are expected to reduce inflammatory side effects. Hens will be immunized with whole bee venom followed by extraction of total hyperimmune yolk Ig and purification by affinity chromatography. The resulting antibodies will be characterized by in vitro immunochemical analyses and by venom neutralization in a mouse protection assay. Based on these feasibility studies, expanded formal development is anticipated to continue to fulfill pharmaceutical licensing requirements.",

        "abstract": "High-speed analog optical links for microwave and millimeter wave transmission require new designs for semiconductor lasers, to extend their performance. Laser bandwidths are presently limited by the small differential gain coefficient of the bulk material. This proposal describes a technical approach which will overcome these limitations and allow fabrication of lasers with modulation bandwidths well beyond 30 GHz. The approach takes advantage of the smaller dimensions of vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) which result in increased relaxation oscillation frequency and significantly improved damping of the response. These limitations in VCSELs are significantly improved over those in in-plane lasers. Very high relaxation oscillation frequencies have been demonstrated. A resonance frequency per square root power coefficient of 7.6 GHz per square root milliwatt has been determined using relative intensity noise measurements, and a maximum relaxation oscillation frequency of 71 GHz was observed by streak camera measurements, on an 8 micrometer square VCSEL. Since this performance was obtained at 980 nm wavelengths, the goal of this effort is to develop 1310 and 1550 nm VCSELs with similar or improved high frequency performance. By using VCSELs, we believe that arrays of high-speed microwave optical sources can be produced at low cost.",

Empirical rules and constant inspection are required for commercial and military aircraft because real-time data are not known for the high-cost systems. This effort proposes imbedded microelectronic and microelectromechanical devices to constantly monitor aerospace systems and a life-cycle analysis of the system's reliability and readiness. The imbedded devices will be located throughout the aerospace system at strategic locations to provide the analysis program with information not only on electrical systems but also provide information on vibration, acceleration, temperature, pressure, and stress. The Phase I effort will identify suitable candidate applications, provide a framework for the life-cycle analysis program, and construct one or more microelectomechanical sensors on chip suitable for aerospace systems applicatons. Other candidate microelectromechanical devices will be identified for use in a life-cycle predictive system/sensor network. The sensors will include on-chip electronics to reduce the central computer's computational burden. Phase II efforts will provide a suite of micro-sensors integrated into a life-cycle predictive system suitable for aerospace systems and for commercial applications. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: The life-cycle predictive system with imbedded sensors for real-time analysis will enalbe military and commercial aircraft to anticipate future failure or imminent failure of structures/systems. This will in turn prevent certain classes of air-borne catastrophes and save lives. The technology may be applied to other high-cost structures that exist in stressed conditions.",

Further, image smear presents a problem during wide field of regard slewing, and improved methods are proposed for stabilizing the image during the frame capture time. This SBIR will address both of these separate yet related issues by developing innovative optical methods for creating a large field of regard as well as developing a means for stabilizing the image motion during the time of image capture. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: The methods developed in this SIBR could have significant benefits in virtually all commercial arenas where wide fields of regard need to be covered with high resolution.

A four part effort will be performed in Phase I: 1) an investigation of tools and methodologies currently available for analysis of design complexity; 2) a determination of areas specific to avionics which have not been addressed; 3) the presentation of innovative solutions to the areas found in area 2; and 4) the definition of requirements for a tool to automate these solutions.",

Second, we define optical interfaces to the network that provide optical format conversion so that the data format in the subsystem can be matched to the data format on the network. Third, our interfaces are based on recent advances in design and fabrication of smart pixel optoelectronic arrays. We will explore alternative architectures, including switched interconnections, beam steering, and ring network topologies. Our system design will take advantage of emerging device and packaging technologies and will exploit Optivision's experience with other interconnection subsystems. An interconnect architecture will be selected and performance models developed. These investigations will also suggest limitations of current smart pixel, packaging and integration technologies in terms of the optical performance, power dissipation and types of functions that can be performed.

We propose the use of an IPM to phase shift the two propagation eigen-modes of a highly birefringent optical fiber and to directly recover this phase, which is proporational to the voltage being measured, using a method which is independent of the operating point of the system. This system is independent of the operating point of the system. This system will use a continuous wave (CW) fiber coupled diode pumped solid state laser source to achieve high signal to noise ratio shot noise limited performance. OPTRA's method of phase detection removes the +-1/8 cycle (45 degrees) maximum phase excursion which is typical of Mach-Zehnder amplitude modulators and extends the dynamic range to cover the full potential of the IPM device. This translates to a factor of 40 increase in dynamic range for commonly available IMP devices. The maximum modulation rate for OPTRA's approach is limited only by the IPM and not by laser chirp or nonlinear amplifier effects as in direct amplitude modulation. The maximum modulation rates reported using Lithium Niobate waveguide based IPM are aound 20GHz.",

Specific goals of this Phase I are to 1) further investigate the use of B9 anti-receptor antibody for therapy of rabies in a laboratory animal model (mouse) and define optimal dose and schedule of treatment, 2) investigate the ability of 39 antibody to induce protective neutralizing rabies antibody and compare this reagent with a licensed rabies vaccine, 3) determine the toxic effects of 39 antibody in mice, and 4) prepare and purify a large amount of 39 antibody and a master hybridoma cell bank for these and future studies.

        "abstract": "Recycling of plastic containers has been retarted by the lacck of demand for plastic scrap. This is due to the dearth of products manufactured from recycled plastics. One of the reasons for this is the poor quality surface finish which is obtainable from recycled plastics such as high density polyethylene (HDPE) used in milk and liquid detergent bottles. Another problem facing our country is the decaying infrastructure. Road salt causes concrete reinforcing rods to rust, which causes concrete to spall, thus deteriorating bridges, airfields, and parking garages. Similarly, reinforced cocrete in wharves, locks, and other marine facilities are degraded by the same mechanism. An economical solution to both of these problems can be achieved by recycling plastic resins into glass fiber reinforced composites to maufacture a non-rusting reinforcing bar for concrete structures. This can be achieved economically with existing technology. Orbital Research has already manufactured compression molded glass fiber reinforced HDPE composites made from recycled plastic. This SBIR will develop an extruded/pultruded glass reinforced rebar. In Phase I, extruded/pultruded rebar will be fabricated in small quantities and tested in a laboratory. Phase II will fabricate large quantities of different sizes of rebars and test them in various types of concrete applications.",

The IVD program will decrease the time required by healthcare providers to provide basic information about sexuality and contraception, allowing more time to be spent on counseling adolescents about sexuality. A total of six programs are planned with separate program material for Caucasian, African-American, and Hispanic males and females. In Phase l, we will produce a prototype of one program. The exact nature of the material presented will be determined using formative evaluation procedures with provider and target adolescent focus groups. In Phase I we will develop and test a prototype interactive videodisc-based program for use by healthcare providers in providing adolescent patients with information about sexuality and contraception. We will evaluate the extent to which the program is effective in increasing knowledge and in encouraging abstinence and effective contraception practices.",

This system must include resource allocation/optimization, communications management, all-source data fusion battle management, advanced graphics, and a tactical metric. Some of these functions are performed manually while others involving close coordination with tactical forces are genrally not a substantial part of current IUSS responsibilities. Some automation will be added with FDS and SDS. However, these systems do not fully manage active/passive interoperability of even the available surveillance sensors and the information from these systems will still not be tightly coupled with tactical ASW information. ORINCON's proposed research will carry out a requirements definition and a high-level and detailed design for this tactical decision aid, building on our DARPA Acoustic Warfare Decision Support System experience. As a result of these efforts, substantial innovative technology can be brought to bear on the design of this decision aid. Our Phase II efforts will involve implementation of the Phase I design to demonstrate a proof-of-concept system. ORINCON is uniquely qualified to perform this research because of our substantial DARPA expert system experience, our extensive knowledge of both active and passive IUSS systems, and our tracking and data fusion efforts as part of a number of tactical ASW programs.",

To demonstrate than an ANC can perform unsupervised identification of a dynamic model, a software-based ANC will produce a plant identification for a model of a simple beam structure. Model response will be calculated from a finite number of bending moments to generate training data. The control scheme will use an EKF on the first five beam moments plus the neural network. The neural network will training to reduce the error between the model's response and the EKF output. A final report will describe the system configuration, analyze test results, and make recommendations for future investigation. We anticipate that ANCs can provide real-time stabilization of large structures more accurately than traditional control of space structures with a wider range of unknown parameters than are other conventional controllers, and is generally applicalbe to mechanical structure control and robotics.",

A special high-resolution, two-dimensional (2-D) spectral analysisapproach for creating the SAR/ISAR image, rather than using the traditional 2-D fast Fourier Transform (FFT), is demonstrated to significantly reduce clutter while sharpening the resolution of target signatures. After the radar image is formed, two other signal processing techniques can be used to enhance detection of small targets in the presence of image clutter. Polycorrelation techniques (specifically, the biocoherence) are shown to yield uniquely distinctive signatures between target-in-clutter regions and clutter-only regions of SAR imagery. Time-versus-frequency representation (TFR) signal processing techniques can better exploit the Doppler signature difference between targets and clutter, as demonstrated with helicopter radar data in this proposal.",

The shallow water environments they typically operate in make the task of detection even more difficult. These conditions will require the use of an active sonar with a classifier architecture that can operate robustly in a variety of harsh environments. ORINCON proposes to develop both classification feature algorithms and feature vector classifier architectures. Features that are useful in both monostatic and multistatic scenarios will be developed. Classical feature vector classifiers as well as neural network classifiers will be examined. We have specific experience using neural networks to classify active returns recorded with the BSY-1 system and the Low Frequency Active (LFA) system. Automatic classification systems of this type provide 360-degree classification coverage, assistance to inexperienced operators, and the ability to \"dig\" targets out of clutter and reverberation. ORINCON proposes to identify techniques for active classification and define promising active classification algorithms. We will identify existing recorded data collected during Fleet operations for algorithm testing. A general method to prepare simulated recordings of active returns in a realistic background is also presented and a plan to solidify it is proposed.",

In Phase I of this effort, we will restrict our attention to the study of wavelet transform techniques for sequence representation and molecular structure prediction. Wavelet transforms have received a great deal of attention recently and have been shown to be superior to traditional Fourier-based analysis techniques in many respects. Of particular interest for sequence analysis applications are finite-field wavelet transforms. The finite-field wavelet transforms are ideally suited for the analysis of signals (or sequences) that take values in a finite field rather than the fields of real or complex numbers. Since any encoding of a nucleotide or amino acid sequence can be represented quite naturally in a finite field, this technique is very appealing.",

We will model this system based on convergence of the information available on bone electrical signals, on cellular responses to extremely low energy, and low frequency electromagnetic fields. This synthesis of complementary approaches would maximize the potential for development of an electromagnetic signal utilizing magnetic fields (MFs) extremely effective at low energies.

The mechanism of enhancing regeneration is unknown, but is probably linked to one or more frequency components of the PEMF since \"window\" effectiveness using certain pulse combinations have been observed. To pinpoint frequency \"windows\" in the Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) spectrum for peripheral nerve regeneration, chick dorsal root ganglia (DRG) will be exposed to sinusoidal electromagnetic fields from 5 Hz to 355 Hz. DRG will be exposed at both constant current density and constant magnetic field amplitude, and the neurite elongation is measured. A special function generator will be designed to allow flexibility in choosing the increments of frequen- cy to be studied without passing over any \"windows\". Should a certain frequency prove to substantially increase neurite outgrowth, future studies will be done to prove the frequency's effectiveness in enhancing nerve regeneration in vivo (in peripheral and CNS tissue) and in human subjects.",

This includes the studies of factors involved in regulation of PGE isomerase gene expression, development of novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer, diabetes, and the pathogeny of certain forms of schizophrenia. In Phase I, we will purify prostaglandin E isomerase from ram seminal vesicles (RSV), determine conditions for enzyme assay and storage, and evaluate the cofactor requirements of the purified protein. In Phase II research, we will employ affinity chromatography and immunoaffinity chromatography to purify the enzyme to homogeneity. The purified enzyme will be used for the production of polyclonal antibodies and amino acid sequencing.

Although Infection Control programs are computerized at the hospital level, no integrated computer assisted Infection Control programs exist for nursing homes. We have developed a computer program, The Patient Care System (PCS), that integrates a variety of functions in a nursing home setting and has a string clinical orientation. Unlike other commercial programs, our program is written in the command language of a relational data base manager. This feature allows the presentation of standard screens of a \"vertical\" task oriented specific program, while maintaining the data bases open for idiosyncratic query or the writing of local independent programs. The program can be used for management, quality assurance, and research purposes. We propose to develop a computer assisted Infection Control program which will be integrated into PCS as a module to avoid redundancy of data input.

        "abstract": "Pacific Advanced Technology (PAT) is pleased to propose a new and creative solution to single aperture multi-spectral laser warning. Our proposed approach to laser warning can detect multiple laser spectral bands with a single aperture over a wide field of view and determine angle of arrival with in less than a degree. As an example of the multi-spectral nature of this approach, a laser in the midwave infrared as well as a longwave infrared can be detected with a single aperture, thus minimizing modifications to existing platforms and reduce sensor costs due to less components needed. This proposal approach to laser warning uses speckle gram interferometry to perform optical signal processing for coherence detection, coupled with neural network signal processing for classification and direction of arrival. Using neural networks on the focal plane array to perform the post signal processing will enable real time detection, discrimination and warning in a light weight small package. This new technology allows the straight forward manufacture of a simple, compact optical system which will detect and warn against laser threats. During the phase I portion of this SBIR we will model the PAT proposed laser warning approach for the Army's CW threats using the PAT laser warning computer simulation model. We will also perform a first order design of the neural network signal processor that is an integral part of the PAT approach to a laser warning system. To our knowledge this approach to laser warning has not been discussed, offered or pursued elsewhere in the Department of Defense.",

Key requirements for the system include the ability to reliably deliver water to points remote from the supply source at a rate of 200 gallsons per day in an environment where the temperature can be a -70 degree Fahrenheit, a system that has minimum weight to water ratio and which can be set up in less than six (6) hours. Both automatic controlled systems and man portable containerized systems will be studied. A block diagram of the system will be developed and equipment will be selected or designed for each block of the system. Each selected piece of equipment will be analyzed for performance in the environment, weight, reliability, maintainability, and power consumption for pumping and heating. A total system weight analysis will be performed to demonstrate a viable system weight to water weight ratio.

The third technique uses a screen composed of phyllosilicate minerals that are transmissive in the RF and reflective in the IR. The fourth technique uses an agile, IR fiber-optic, RF dielectric bundle to relay an IR source image to a dielectric IR collimator which projects a collimated IR image to the missile.

        "abstract": "This project will devise and develop an efficient and cost-effective technique for removing lead-contaminated paint films from painted surfaces in Army buildings scheduled for demolition. High-presure water jets confined within a shield (operating head) remove the paint from the surface. The operating head is sealed against the work surface by flexible flange. Small channels in the flange allow the air entering the operating head at high velocity. The air/water/paint film residue mixture is drawn out by an air compressor which discharged the misture through a centrifugal separator and a filter into the atmosphere. The separated water and paint mixture passes to a series of tanks in which centrifugation, settling, and filtration processes remove the paint residue from the wash water. Recirculation of the cleaned wash water through a positive-displacement pump supplying the jets minimizes the volume of waste water requiring disposal.

        "abstract": "In the next generation of air-breathing high-performance engines, significant engine performance improvements are envisioned by combusting hydrogen with air in a regeneratively cooled carbon/carbon composite combustion chamber. Surfaces subjected to aerodynamic heating will also be cooled by recirculating hydrogen through cooling tubes. To date, approaches investigated have not had desired levels of heat transfer. In the Ph 1 program, two approaches to providing high heat transfer between cooling tubes and the C/C composite will be investigated. In the first, holes machined in the composite will be lined with a refractory metal liner using a proprietary process which provides good bonding between the metal line and the composite. The process should completely fill any cracks or pores exposed in the C/C composite. In the second approach, metal alloy tubes will be placed in refractory metal lined holes in the C/C composite. The gap between the tubes and the lined holes will be filled with copper or other non-reactive brazing metal. Filling the gap with high-conductivity metal should increase heat transfer to desired levels. Samples will be tested for hydrogen leakage, resistance to thermal cycling and resistance to high heat fluxes. The data developed in Ph I will lead to the design and operation of a prototype heat exchanger in Ph II.",

        "abstract": "K31 is a promising murine anti-CD48 monoclonal antibody (MAB) which can deplete tissue grafts of antigen presenting accessory cells to reduce their immunogenicity. Because any in vivo use of this MAB will be limited by the human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) response, the overall goal is to use PCR technology to humanize K31. In Phase I, we will clone and sequence heavy and light chain variable regions of K31 then utilize murine heavy and light chain CDRs to reshape K31 into a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody (hK31). During Phase II, we will express hK31 using an amplifiable high level antibody expression system developed in this laboratory and test activity of hK31 for in vitro binding and functional activity. At the completion of Phase II, we plan to initiate preclinical development of hK31. K31 has promise as a therapeutic antibody to improve the transplantation of allo-mismatched T-depleted bone marrow (BM). In vitro data suggests that simultaneous depletion of T cells and accessory cells with K31 reduces the immunogenicity of HLA-mismatched BM grafts which reduces graft rejection. Thus, in contrast to CAMPATH-1 being developed by Burrough Wellcome, K31 may be a useful reagent for preventing both graft-versus-host and host-versus-graft reactions in the situation of HLA-mismatched BM transplantation. While humanization of K31 will not be required for in vitro use, any in vivo use will require a humanized form of K31 (hK31). hK31 has promise to reduce the accessory cell mediated immunogenicity of transplanted solid organs. hK31 associated immunosuppression may be a useful approach for refractory solid organ rejection episodes or recalcitrant autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. hK31 may also be useful for treatment of various lymphomas or leukemias.",

        "abstract": "Cancer chemotherapy is limited by toxicity sustained by normal tissues. To increase specificity of drug delivery, antineoplastic agents have been linked to monoclonal antibodies (MABs) that bind to antigens selectively expressed on tumor cells. However, this strategy suffers from several drawbacks. Practical limits on drug loading or slow internalization of drug conjugates into cancer cells may limit tumor cell killing. In addition, cells expressing low levels of antigen in heterogeneous cell populations may escape destruction. In our preliminary work to overcome problems associated with chemoimmunoconjugates, we prepared an enzyme-MAB conjugate (MABzyme) by chemically linking beta-glucuronidase to an anti- hepatoma MAB. This MABzyme localized to the target tumor cell surface where it specifically converted a nontoxic glucuronide conjugated prodrug to the parent compound, the potent alkylator, and p-hydroxy aniline mustard. Genetically engineered MABzymes can overcome problems encountered in the preparation of MABzymes by standard chemical conjugation methods. In addition, utilization of recombinant MAB fragments will increase tissue penetration, blood clearance and activity. Thus, the overall goal is to prepare recombinant MABzymes linking a single chain version of an anti-hepatoma MAB to a cloned human beta-glucuroni- dase. During Phase I, we will clone and sequence heavy and light chain variable regions of hepatoma specific MAB hep1 and, construct a single chain version of this antibody. We will evaluate binding activity of this scFV and construct recombinant MABzyme linking the scFv to cDNA of human beta- glucuronidase. Finally, we will express and purify the rMABzyme to evaluate in vitro activity. Using this reagent to activate novel glucuronide prodrugs will provide a highly selective therapy for various forms of human cancer.",

        "abstract": "Optimal therapy to prevent graft rejection should be based on the induction of specific tolerance to the donor tissue. Current concepts on immunological tolerance hold that anergy is the result of intercellular signalling after TCR/MHC-peptide interaction in the absence of a so- called Costimulatory signal. This co-stimulatory signal is provided by cell surface of antigen presenting cells (APC). At present, the best candidate co-stimulatory signal that determines whether TGR-stimulation leads to full T-cell activation or to T-cell tolerance is generated by interaction of CD28 on the T cells with B7 on APC. B7-24 is a novel monoclonal antibody (MAB) that binds to the B7 molecule. Recently obtained in vitro data suggests that blocking the B7/CD28 interaction with MAB B7- 24 indeed results in antigen-specific tolerance. The overall goal is to use PCR technology to humanize B7-24 because any in vivo use of this MAB will be limited by the human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) response.

Amino acid composition and physical properties indicate that this protein has not been previously described. Highly purified hepatopoietin administered after a lethal dose of carbon tetrachloride protected the exposed mice. Serum enzymes indicate a protective effect on hepatocytes. Sufficient partially purified hepatopoietin is available to prepare fragments to obtain internal peptide sequences. Preparation of antibodies is underway. Thus, the Phase I goals are to use either oligonucleotide probes or antibodies to clone the cDNA from a commercially available fetal liver cDNA library. In Phase II, the hepatopoietin will be expressed, purified and tested in various models of hepatic injury.

Such a system can benefit from more effective use of improved graphical interfaces, interactive video, knowledge-based systems, and other advanced computing technologies. Recent advancements and breakthroughs in video compression/decompression, digital video editing, multimedia authoring tools, digital telecommunications, and object-oriented programming, enable the economic development and distribution of a health promotion information system, tentatively named HealthPro, that meets the needs of the general public, including the underserved. Cancer education and health promotion materials are hampered by fear of the subject matter, sameness of material, time lag in responding to pertinent research data and variation in user age and intelligence. HealthPro can reduce these barriers by presenting information in ways that are attractive, dramatic, as well as responsive to new information and variations in user demographics. HealthPro will utilize a \"Headline News\" format to promote a dynamic and interactive system that will be informative, exciting to watch, and tailored to each individual user.",

The quality, interpretation, and usefulness of chemically- induced cell proliferation data are dependent on the procedures and protocols used. The goal of this Phase I study is to quantitate background cell proliferation rates in selected target tissues from rodents of various ages.

Creare has developed very compact, high flux heat exchangers which can be used to gather heat from the structures as well as to boil and condense the working fluid. Creare has also developed turbomachinery for aerospace applications in which advanced fabrication techniques enable small size and high efficiency, and non-contact bearings give simplicity and high reliability.

State-of-the art compressors use unlubricated flexure bearings and non-contact seals to eliminate contamination and wear, approaches requiring expensive high precision manufacturing and assembly. They use linear motors which are expensive and heavy and require accurate non-contact position sensing and complex and sophisticated electronic controls to manage displacement and vibration cancellation. The inexpensive compressor proposed for Stirling and Pulse Tube cycle spacecraft cryocoolers makes use of design approaches and manufacturing technology proven by decades of mass produced industrial and commercial products. The diaphragm compressor provides nearly isothermal gas compression processes well suited to Stirling and Pulse Tube cycle thermodynamics. In Phase I the compressor design process will be developed and documented, a typical implementation will be analyzed, and a responsive machine design geometry will be synthesized. Fluid inventory management, lubrication effectiveness, seal leakage, windage losses, and vibration will be assessed to demonstrate feasibility of the concept for satisfying demanding spacecraft requirements. Manufacturing costs will be estimated and a final report prepared detailing all Phase I findings.",

The innovative hardware utilizes the vertical showerhead-type reactor configuration. It will enable for the first time detailed and active control over the transport of reactants to the surface of the substrate wafer, including the distribution of both flow rate and composition. This control will foster low cost/high yield reactor scale-up to larger diameter wafers. The injector can also enable effective control actions to realize the potential of \"Intelligent Processing of Materials\" (IPM). The new hardware can be retrofit into existing MOCVD reactors. The Phase I project will test a simplified version of the injector in an MOCVD reactor to demonstrate that the user can exert firm control over reactant transport and the cause-and-effect relationship for growth of the thin film. The Phase I injector design will be supported by detailed computational modeling of the fluid flow and heat/mass transfer within the reactor. In this way, the injector can be designed to complement, and perhaps overcome, the global transport characteristics of the reactor. Comparison of experimental and modeling results will put us in in an excellent position at the start of Phase II to design a prototype injector with full capabilities.",

Key features of the development include innovative fabrication methods to produce a unique rotor and impeller that allows the machine to achieve necessary speeds for good performance. The machine is intended for use in spaceborne cryocoolers where input power to the system is limited to about 100 watts. The compressor will be used in a reverse Brayton cycle in which the turbomachines run in high speed gas bearings. This configuration has the advantage that vibrations are negligible - an important consideration for IR sensors. Furthermore, the system is component oriented, allowing the flexibility in integration with sensor systems. The succesful development of this device enables the practical use of 0.5w - 2w at temperatures between 40K and 100K. Phase I consists of analysis and trade studies to produce a preliminary design and predict performance of the compressor and the cycle. In Phase II, a prototype device will be designed, fabricated and tested.",

Linear position can be determined from passive or active vibrating beam type accelerometers while rotation can be determined from resonating tuning fork type gyros. Technical problems relating to noise sources, instabilities and feasibility are to be investigated. Unique mechanical configurations, crystal orientations and micro-electronic designs will be conceived, modeled and tested when possible. The feasibility of this technology for the INS will be assessed in Phase I and a recommendation provided for research and development in Phase II. Based on a large commercial potential in automobile navigation, aerospace navigation and six degree-of-freedom sensing of structural vibration; it is possible that the INS may be produced through micromachining batch processing methods at a significant cost saving to current manufacturing methods.",

        "abstract": "In this proposal, we describe plans to extend, for the first time, the operation of the detectors based on silicon like materials and technology to 12um and beyond. The materials we propose are the SixGe1-x alloys. Two types of detectors will be investigated: (a)Detectors based on Silicide/SixGe1-x Schottky barriers, and (b)Detectors based on SixGe1-x/Si multiquantum wells. The work will be done in cooperation with Professor J.C. Sturm from the Princeton University and Professor W.F. Kosonocky from the New Jersey Institute of Technology. The reliability and the cost effectiveness of SiGe based detectors easisly surpasses the MCT and MWQ III-V detectors, thus making them very attractive for a variety of civilian and military uses. We believe that this proposal adequately addresses the following important issues in the detection of the LWIR radiation: operation beyond 12um, operation at 77oK and above, operation at normal angle of incidence and utilization of reliable and cost effective materials and technologies.",

        "abstract": "Interest in medical procedures such as Photodynamic Therapy (PDT), Interstitial Laser Hyperthermia (ILH), and Interstitial Laser Photocoagulation (ILP) is on the rise. Other medical procedures such as Cardiovascular-PDT (CV-PDT) and Laser Tissue Welding (LTW) are in their infancy. The one unifying parameter among these distinctly different disciplines is the use of a light source and a delivery system. Light sources are abundant and proliferating. Delivery systems are just evolving from second generation devices to more functional and user friendly third-generation devices. One such third generation device is the Flex Cylinder Diffuser (FCD) designed for use in interstitial PDT for the treatment of cancer. As an improvement to the FCD, a Guidewire Compatible Cylindrical Light Diffusing catheter has been designed. The guidewire compatible device potentially offers many advantages over second generation delivery systems: 1) safe delivery of the device to the target tissue; 2) a separate lumen to supply vital fluids to tissues obstructed by the device; 3) longitudinal and radial light uniformity for even treatment and simplified dosimetry; 4) higher power handling capabilities; 5) input mode independence; and 6) extreme flexibility. It is the goal of this project to develop this patented light diffusing catheter into a product useful for the above cited medical procedures. To that end the 1.0 cm long, 4.0 French diffuser will be capable of handling 4.0 Watts of input power at 660 nm wavelength with a longitudinal and radial light uniformity of +/- 33%. The methods of optimization and testing are detailed in the proposal along with the animal testing of the catheter in both rabbits and dogs.",

Specific determinants on DNA recognized by pathogenic anti-DNA antibodies remain to be elucidated. Difficulty in identifying these elements stems from antibody heterogeneity in SLE patients and from the technical challenges of required experiments. Work by others using anti-idiotypic antibodies against anti-DNA antibodies suggests that despite this heterogeneity a small number of combining sites is responsible for SLE pathology. Recent advances using random oligonucleotide selection strategies to identify specific recognition elements for proteins suggest a solution to the problem of pathogenic anti-DNA antibody determinant identification. Preliminary work using IgG from a lupus mouse (BXSB) indicates that random selection is appropriate for identifying anti-DNA antibody determinants. Using purified IgG from SLE patients with nephritis, we will identify the major DNA sequence determinants specific for pathogenic anti-DNA antibodies and to ascertain the reactivity of these determinants among SLE patients. Ultimately, determinants that are widely recognized by patient IgGs will be used as lead compounds to design drugs that block formation of damaging immune complexes and inhibit production of pathogenic antibodies in SLE patients.",

The limited supply of plant sources and low yields have stimulated searches for alternative technologies to meet the demand of this experimental cancer drug. We will improve the extraction and isolation of taxol by utilizing a combination of two technologies, supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) and centrifugal countercurrent chromatography (CCC). Both techniques can be scaled up to the processing plant level. Recent work indicates that SFE is an effective method for extracting taxol from Taxus bark and needles. The taxol-rich extract can be separated by CCC, a method based on the liquid-liquid partition principle, and is milder than column or HPLC chromatographic separations. In Phase I, optimal extraction and isolation conditions will be determined along with the procedures for scaling up the process.

Mivacurium is a recently developed drug that may replace succinylcholine in many or all of these cases.

Because these tumors are small-, round-cells, it is very difficult to differentiate them from tumors such as Ewing's sarcoma, neuroblastoma, nephroblastoma and malignant lymphoma. Therefore, the diagnosis of childhood RMS is sometimes very difficult. Since the human muscle determination gene Myo-D was found to be expressed in several human RMS cell lines, cultured primary RMS tumor explants, biopsies of tumor and normal skeletal muscle tissues, but not in other non-muscle tissues and tumors, MyoD can serve as a differential marker to distinguish RMS from other small-, round-cell tumors of soft tissues. The primary goal is to produce a panel of MAbs against human Myo-D protein in mutagenic differentiation. Specific aims are l) to generate a panel of MAbs recognizing human Myo-D protein, 2) to characterize these Myo-D-specific MAbs with authentic Myo-D protein, and 3) to evaluate the clinical values of these MAbs in the diagnosis of RMS.",

        "abstract": "Each year more than one hundred thousand cases of prostate cancer have been diagnosed in the United States. Prostate cancer is the first in solid tumor incidence and second in cancer related death in the American male population. Yet, the factors which are involved in prostate carcinogenesis, except for the presence of androgen, remain unclear. It has been shown that metastatic prostate cancer patients with higher pretreatment plasma testosterone levels tend to have a greater survival rate when receiving primary hormonal therapy than those patients with low testosterone levels at the time of diagnosis. Thus, the androgen and androgen receptor (AR) expression may play an important role during prostate carcinogenesis. Recently, the anti-AR monoclonal antibody (mAb) has become available which make the assessment of AR levels and their localization in tissues possible. These anti-AR mAbs were developed using peptide fragments as immunogens, and they do not always stain tissue effectively or inhibit AR function. Thus, the application of these mAbs has been limited. In addition, the lack of high affinity anti-AR mAbs and purified human AR proteins has hampered the development of a convenient ELISA test for clinical applications. We will focus on the production and purification of full-length AR proteins from insect cells infected with baculovirus vector carrying the AR gene; these proteins will be used as immunogens to produce high affinity anti-AR mAbs and develop immunoassays for the clinical applications in prostate cancer.",

During the Phase I investigations, the heat transfer performance of a microchannel heat exchanger with phase changer material suspensions will be evaluated. In addition, experiments will be done to verify that the system performance is up to the required criteria, viz. 1000W/cm2 at 300K.",

        "abstract": "Effective utiliization of Air Force electro-optical systems requires precise measurement of cloud properties with high spatial and temporal resolution. Radiative interactions of clouds with the thermal and optical emissions of targets and with the ambient background radiation field affect the ability to detect and track targets traveling through cloud filled skies. The results of the FIRE program concerning the sensitivity of IRST systems show how important the effects of cloud backgrounds can be. The proposed research will examine the degree to which passive infrared remote sensing technology can determine the microphysical and optical properties of clouds. We will design an all-sky imaging system that measures cloud thermal radiances at a few closely spaced wavelengths within each of the 305u and 10-12u atmospheric windows to determine cloud temperatures and IR emmissivities and other microphysical properties. Polarization measurements of scattered solar IR will give information about the ice structure of clouds.",

        "abstract": "The proposed work will develop a concept for incorporating high-fidelity system performance models into SIMNET-like simulators for sensors. The models will include end-to-end modeling of sensor to virtual battlefield radiometric input and the transmission of sensor responses over a network. Sensor response modeling will include subsystem models of optics or antenna, transducer, signal and data processors, data transmission, and coupling to the platform controlling sensor position, line-of-sight direction and motion. The required sensor performance models, constrained to operate on workstation-class computers, provide real-time sensor responses. The concept consists of a system capable of building a robust Sensor Response Simulation (SRS) applicable to any desired sensor, but unconstrained with regard to execution time; plus algorithm development procedures to yield real time transformation algorithms between the virtual battlefield state and the sensor response. Phase I will prove concept usefulness and validity by delivering an SRS system prototype with a fully developed real-time sensor response model for the strategic DSP and another system representative of a tactical class sensor. Phase II deliverables will include the SRS system with integrated DIS or SIMNET interoperability and documented procedures for adding a simulator for any sensor. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: The workstation-class system for building robust end-to-end sensor response simulations will have widespread application to sensor engineering, material acquisition, and C3 training of sensor effectiveness. All government and commercial enterprises involved in sensor system engineering, for any application from defense to environmental monitoring, will benefit from this technology.",

        "abstract": "The practical limit of optical processor technology ultimately relates to the detection and subsequent electronic interpretation process. Optical source and modulation components are capable of much higher throughput and dynamic range than the detector and postprocessing electronics. Detectors and readout electronics typically must be optimized to specific processor technology to make it useful in system application or critical mission. Many emerging optical processor architectures use two dimensions to encode and process data and thus require high-resolution, two-dimensional detector devices. As a leader in optical processing, Photonic Systems Inc. (PSI) has recognized that two dimensional detectors with highly flexible readout control and postprocessing capabilities are essential for delivering processing gain and data throughput commensurate with the requirements of new architectures. PSI has developed and implemented a very flexible control and readout detection assembly coupled with a very high thoughput Digital Signal Processing (DSP) package that is based on the Texas Instruments' TMS320C30 processor. All readout and post-processing algorithms are programmable on the fly though the Intel PC Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) peripheral bus. We propose to start with our working detector and postprocessing subsystem and degign a compact and rugged module that implements its' functionality in an approved form.",

Also use of light sources rather than modulators dramatically simplifies the optical system. Phase-locked laser arrays have been demonstrated by several groups but efforts have not yet been made to incorporate them into parallel optical processing systems. PRI's experience in laser arrays and optics make the likelihood for success in this program extremely high.

        "abstract": "Conventinoal SAR systems use film as their input/output display medium, which makes these processors large, unreliable and slow with respect to the Navy's need for a real-time, compact SAR pattern recognitions system. We propose to fulfill this need by inserting arrays of individually and electrically addressable vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) into a spatio-temporal adaptive optical processing module (OPM) that operates directly on the SAR echo returns, bypassing the SAR image generation. Generating the SAR image is not necessary, and it is this process that prevents real-time pattern recognition on SAR data. The implementation of the proposed OPM will straightforwardly simplify pattern recognition of SAR data, and dramatically improve the performance as compared to alternative input light sources based on film or spatial light modulators. For the OPM mentioned above, higher speed, more versatility and device tolerance, as well as very compact optical system design is a direct result of the VCSEL microlaser arrays, a recent advancement in optical device technology. VCSELs are fundamentally much better suited for this application than the more circular, low-divergence beams, and they can be fabricated in arbitrary one-dimensional and two-dimensional patterns. The utility of this technology, and the OPM approach which is based on VCSELs is likely to range far beyond what we can presently imagine.",

One major limitation of packaged MCMs using electrical interconnects is the limited operating speed caused by relatively long electrical interconnect lines.

Optoelectronic interconnection, with speed and bandwidth independent of interconnection idstance, is a potential replacement for electrical interconnects, particularly suitable for board-to-board three-dimensional MCM packaging as it will provide non-physical contact interconnection paths. Physical Optics Corporation proposes a new three-dimensional interconnection architecture for MCM packaging using waveguide modulators, microprisms (MP), and imaging optical tunnels (IOT). the new MP-IOT interconnect technique offers advantages for board-to-board MCM packaging: high speed and wide bandwidth interconnects (> GHz), lower power consumption at high data rates, low clock skew, low propagation loss, high packaging density, large fanout density, non-physical contact board-to-board inteconnects, low crosstalk, and reduced system sensitivity to EMI.

This Fabry-Perot etalon can be used to diagnose the deviation of optical wavelength and/or beam angle, thus predicting or identifying failures in electro-optic and photonic systems. The successful design can be achieved by using two of POC's existing technologies: high-efficiency volume holography and a coherently coupled, tunable, holographic Fabry-Perot filter. The FPF will be combined with a tunable double-cavity vernier configuration using a relatively ordinary low-finesse FP cavity which is independently tunable over a small portion (1/20) of the spectral range covered. As a result, a high-resolution vernier effect over the fully covered spectral range is obtained. The proposed TVH FPF will, at low cost, exhibit narrow-band (1A or less) tunability to any arbitrary wavelength within a spectral range of at least 100 nm in the visible (including the blue-green) or the IR. In addition, because of the nature of the coherently coupled recording of the holographic mirrors, large-aperture TVH FPFs can be fabricated.",

        "abstract": "We consider multispectral imaging not just as a problem of providing a reconfigurable filter (variable Fabry-Perot etalon, acousto-optic tunable filter, light-induced holographic variable grating) but rather as a problem of overall system design. We find that the only variable dispersion element (VDE) capable of avoiding aliasing of the spectral images at the imaging (CCD) plane is a combination of a variable grating with a fixed Fabry-Perot etalon. We propose to build the VDE, using a variable grating mode (VGM) effect occurring in some liquid crystal (LC) mixtures. Under a dc voltage applied to such a mixture, a phase grating appears in the direction perpendicular to the quiescent state alignment of the LC molecules. Moreover, by increasing the dc bias we can linearly change the induced grating frequency over a wide range. Since the induced refractive index modulation is rather significant (up to 0.2) we expect to achieve theoretically limited diffraction efficiency. We propose a concept of a multispectral imager (MI) that combines the VGM device with an inexpensive, low-finesse, fixed Fabry-Perot (FP) etalon, and will select a narrow spectral band for each consecutive image. Thus, no image degradation is expected while rapid switching of spectral bands occurs. Phase I of this project will experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed VGM-FP combination for bandpass selection in the MI.",

POC has developed a fast response, high diffraction efficiency birefringent material which will be incorporated in this new composite. The multiplexing of birefringent holograms makes the in- and out-of-plane coupling of guided waves feasible.

Direct diode laser pumping or excitation via diode laser pumped solid state lasers both offer attractive reatures. From an efficiency and size perspective, the best solution is probably the direct diode laser pumped approach. However, this may be a longer term solution since high power diodes are still under development. In this proposal, we describe a program that will identify and demonstrate efficient laser pumped gas phase lasers that operate in the 3 to 5 micron wavelength region. We will develop and apply a screening methodology to identify and prioritize attractive candidate molecules. In addition, using existing equipment, we will demonstrate efficient laser oscillation on one or two of the most attractive candidates. We will also design a Phase II program that will extend the approach to the 8 to 12 micron range and develop an efficient prototype laser for Air Force applications. These lasers would also have a considerable commercial market.",

        "abstract": "A novel, non-intrusive technique is proposed for the temporal and spatial imaging of high-intensity infrared laser beams. The technique employs a visible probe laser to excite phosphorescence in a gas seeded into a flow of N2. The high intensity, IR laser beam passes through this gas jet flow. Irradiation of the emitting gas by the IR laser causes a reduction in emission proportional to the laser intensity. Cylindrical optics are employed to define an emitting sheet in a plane transverse to the IR laser beam. This emission is spatially resolved using a image-intensified TV camera synched to the probe laser to obtain the laser bem intensity profile. The temporal resolution of the device is defined by the emission lifetime of the gas of approximately 1 ms with a framing rate of 30 Hz. Commercially available image processing software may be employed to provide real-time diagnostic capability and images may be stored on standard video tape for post-processing. The proposed beam diagnostic technique is directly applicable to target plane beam diagnostics requirements at the High Engergy Laser Systems Test Facility (HELSTF) in the various test areas. It will provide the accuracy and teh reliablility needed to make high quality, rapid target plane beam diagnostics a reality.",

This monitor would be buried next to fuel tanks in \"tank farms\" and would provide a direct indication of fuel leaks in the field. The Phase I effort will be focused on validating the fluorescence concept as a monitor for fuel tank failures and starting the development process which transforms a laboratory concept into a field worthy and fully tested instrumented. The fluorescence fuel detection system is based on the red shifted fluorescence emitted by a fuel irradiated with ultraviolet light. Typical hydrocarbon fuels (for example, JP-4 and JP-5) absorb strongly for wavelengths less than 380 nm and radiate a portion of the abosrbed energy as red shifted fluorescence. The addition of rhodamine dyes can be used where direct fuel fluorescence cannot distinguish between fuel types. We have shown that this absorption/fluorescence process produces signals that are strong enough to be easily detectable for sand coated with JP-5.",

        "abstract": "Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) describes a program that will design, build, and test a simple, compact, and reliable monitor for airborne lead with specific application to indoor firing ranges. This instrument will provide the unique capability of real-time monitoring of lead levels on the range. It will be small and portable and therefore will provide local lead concentrations at various locations within the firing range. Our instrument will eliminate the need for extractive sampling techniques and the subsequent off-line analysis at an analytical laboratory. The instrument uses a spark to ionize a very small volume of air within the firing range. A plasma is thus created in the spark zone and species in the plasma emit light at their characteristic colors or wavelengths. The intensity of the emission from any species can be used to determine its concentration. The spark will be generated using a simple power supply and a pair of electrodes. This will make the instrument compact and turnkey in operation. PSI has used a variant of this technique to detect lead in airborne aerosols at ppm levels. In this Phase I effort, we will design, construct, test, and calibrate a preprototype instrument that will be further refined and field tested in Phase II.",

BY CAREFUL CONTROL OF THE WAVEFORM, ELECTROLYTIC PRC CODEPOSITION CAN BOTH ENHANCE AND DEPRESS THE RATIO OF PARTICLE TO METAL DEPOSITED OVER THAT FOUND FROM CODEPOSITION BY MEANS OF DIRECT CURRENT PLATING. THIS INNOVATION HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE NOVEL AND IMPROVED COATINGS IN THE ELECTROPLATING INDUSTRY.

This model processes paired lists of event times to discern microscopic patterns in event timing, and is called the Initiated Event Model (IEM). The goals of the underlying model, and the output of the associated set of algorithms is a histogram of the various random delay times that would occur if events in one list helps precipitate or induce at least some of the \"resultant\" outcome events in the second list. The model continue to make useful predictions even when the initiating events occur so frequently that a given outcome could be due to any of the several proceeding initiating events. It also works in the presence of randomly occurring outcome events, uncorrelated with the set of proposed initiating events. The work for in the Phase I effort is designed to allow feasibility to be established. We propose to; (a) provide analytic and Monte Carlo estimates of the bias ed variance of the estimator; (b) investigate its domain of applicability; (c) redesign and rewrite existing-program code; and (d), (e) test its feasibility on two well-analyzed mental health data sets.",

We will examine and identify Navy requirements and all facets of data fusion, including a particular requirement that the various data sets be coregistered in time and position. In a parallel effort, we will also examine existing visualization hardware and software, modify existing code or develop new software where appropriate, and verify the fusion/visualization software with test data.

This research is aimed at enhancing the mobility and other functions of individuals with physical disabilities. This work is a feasibility study for an innovative manufacturing process for contoured cushions that will replace existing carving and molding processes with a more efficient, economic and faster process. A reusable die shape will be developed for a molding process; this process will be similar to that used for fabricating custom molded seating systems. It is desirable to eliminate the use of permanent molds in that process because it is time consuming, expensive, requires skilled personnel and produces substantial waste. The key element of the new process is a computer-controlled surface to replace the molds. The project's objective is to evaluate various design alternatives by building models of key system components and evaluating their performance.",

The transformation are invertable and the final product will be an enhanced time series, relatively free from artifacts, that can be processed and displayed on current fleet classification processors, e.g., Multi-Flexible Analysis and Display System (MFLADS). The ability to display the results on current displays in familiar context permits an operator to achieve, without the requirement for training on new concepts or display types, an enhanced capability against a difficult target.

The DLC coatings will provide improved reliability and performance, and maintain the design and dimensional characteristics of the optical fibers against the abrasion, chemical erosion and environmental degradation. DLC layers are inert, moisture and H2 impermeable and will be applied at near room temperature. The DLC films will be applied on commercially available optical glass fibers by magnetically enhanced plasma chemical vapor deposition using an innovative high-intensity cylindrical magnetron reactor developed and pioneered by Plasmatron Coatings and Systems, Inc. Systematic investigations of (i) dependence of hermeticity, (ii) adhesion of DLC to the fiber, (iii) hardness, (iv) scratch resistance and (v) optical and micro-bend losses as a function of microstructure, structure, composition and process parameters will be performed to achieve the proposed objectives. Different layer configuration of DLC films will be studied in Phase I. The cylindrical magnetron reactor, studies in Phase I will be scaled-up to produce an in-line, high-rate, deposition system for coatings optical fibers during manufacturing in Phase II.",

Looking toward a Phase II, we will specify a system capable of delivering fully integrated, real-time multimedia in a captivating presentation mode. Thus, user-students will be able to sustain their concentration while learning complex cognitive concepts. Through the use of object-oriented design, the system will allow user to develop courseware that previously required the skill of programmers, instructional designers, subject matter experts and graphic designers. Courseware development costs will be dramatically reduced with this system. Delivery of the instructional design approach will take advantage of the power and flexibility of the system.

        "abstract": "This proposal is for the development of an optically activated high voltage semiconductor switch device capable of switching loads on and off within nanoseconds or picoseconds. A device of this type would not be possible using the existing limitations imposed by the limited knowledge on the transport of both electrons and holes across a Metal-Insulator-Semiconductor (MIS), and Semiconductor-Insulator-Semiconductor (SIS) interface. In order to provide this type of a device, a uniform bilateral flow of electrons and holes must take place through the interface. To properly characterize this phenomena so that an optically activated gapped semiconductor device os this type can be developed, a Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) will be used to establish the ballistic electron and hole transport mechanisms in insulator and semiconductor interfaces. This characterization data will make it possible to develop a new design for high power switching devices. The development of a high voltage power semiconductor device with rapid response time capable of being optically switched within nanoseconds or picoseconds can then be accomplished using simultaneous tunneling of both holes and elctrons through the Semiconductor-Insulator-Semiconductor (SIS) interface. Two injecting semiconductor junctions (pn-, gap, p-n) based in Si, GaAs or Si C materials with ohmic contacts at both ends will be separated by a gap or oxide interface where tunneling of both electrons and holes can be enhanced (controlled?) by photon injection into the interface.",

We propose a controlled clinical pilot study to determine the feasibility of using the comprehensive Preventive Lifestyles smoking cessation program (comprised of behavior and diet modification, a personalized exercise regimen, nutrition education and nutritional supplementation), as a smoking cessation aid. Study situs is Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Subjects recruited from the general public will receive a standardized counseling/behavioral modification program with the Preventive Lifestyles product. Primary endpoints are product acceptability and incidence of withdrawal symptoms and side effects at six weeks. The endpoints will be determined by a questionnaire and the research team's ability (capability and compatibility) to conduct a randomized trial. The need for program changes also will be determined. The pilot study will include at least forty subjects. Results of this trial will determine the feasibility of performing a long-term (l year) efficacy trial requiring approximately 800 subjects to satisfy appropriate Type I and Type II error problems.",

        "abstract": "Improvement of radiation hardness of CCDs for space applications is extremely important for extending the life of the CCDs. For low orbit satellites the proton damage is most important which reduces the Charge Transfer Efficiency (CTE) and increases the noise of the devices. Charge particles create displacement damage in the silicon lattice which in turn form phosphorous-vacancy (P-V) complex which acts as electron traps. Formation of the trapping centers need to be better understood for designing radiation performance CCDs in the future. By using the software package called Transport of Radiation in Matter (TRIM), we will analyze the formation of defects and defect complexes in the device structures for the CCD devices. Particular attention will be paid to the formation of vacancy complexes by protons and other charged particles. After studying the trap formation process theoretically, we will experimentally verify them by using the accelerator at Harvard University. After we have a good model for the trap formation, we will design device structures as well as plan experiments which will be implemented during Phase II leading to extremely high performance devices for rad hard applications. These devices can be used both for military and commercial space applications.",

In its current form, the chemical conjugate of FGF-SAP is a highly heterogeneous mixture at the molecular level. Thus, it does not lend itself to the rigorous chemical characterization required for clinical evaluation of its potential application in the treatment of FGF receptor-dependent, proliferative disease. For this reason, we will apply recombinant DNA technology to generate a homogeneous product. The specific aims are to l) design and synthesize forms of FGF that retain all of the growth factor's mitogenic activity, but have only one reactive site for its conjugation to SAP, 2) prepare a homogeneous preparation of derivatized SAP, giving it only one reactive site for its conjugation to FGF, and 3) produce a homogeneous chemical conjugate FGF-SAP by using these new starting materials.

The Homogeneous Gene Assay (HGA) coupled with Solid Phase Amplification (SPA) offers a very simple and reliable alternative where a tagged reporter molecule is displaced from a hybrid duplex with an anchored DNA strand by sample DNA. The specificity is conferred by the nucleotide sequence of the reporter/ anchor combination. All major complex steps in the process are completed in the production laboratory; therefore, the assay, as done in the diagnostic laboratory, requires only the addition of sample DNA to an assay vessel and incubation at a specific temperature for 1-3 hr. This simplicity in use should also lead to a significant reduction in cost over currently available technologies. The technology will first be applied to the analysis of alterations in gene copy numbers resulting from either genetic defects or cancer development.",

The technique characterizes cells based on their dielectric (polarization) properties. It utilizes time autocorrelation functions from dynamic light scattering to study the dielectric properties of biological cells. By imposing non-homogeneous electric fields, the correlation function are modulated. The modulations are analyzed by Fourier transformation, giving a spectrum indicative of the dielectric properties of the particles present under the field. The dielectric properties of biological cells are sensitive to the size and distribution of charges. They are representative of the state of the cells and may prove valuable to the understanding of factors influencing charge distributions inside the cells and on their surfaces. The method will attempt to link these properties to simple physical measurements is to render fast, non-invasive characterization of cells possible. The ultimate aim of the effort is the introduction to the marketplace of a fast and sensitive device to detect different species of cells in solution and provide means to study their fundamental properties.

Instead of computing the correlation between the target and the reference patterns, the optical wavelet correlator computes the correlation between the wavelet transform coefficients of the target and reference patterns. It incorporates the efficient feature detection and noise suppression capabilities of wavelet transformation and the inherent high speed and two-dimensional nature of optics. The wavelet matched filter (WMF) is synthesized with the Fourier spectra of the reference pattern and the selected wavelets. This WMF replaces the conventional matched filter (CMF) in the optical wavelet correlator. When an input signal enters the wavelet correlator, the feature extraction and target identification operations are performed in a single step to produce the correlation between the WTs of the input scene and the refernce pattern. By suitably choosing the wavelet functions and their dilation factors, the proposed wavelet correlator is capable of effectively recognizing targets in the presence of clutter and noise.",

        "abstract": "The human balance mechanism plays an important role in the performance of Air Force personnel in flight operations. Research is needed to better understand and predict the susceptibility of individuals to flight related balance and motion disorders. Existing balance tests, based solely on the observation of reflex responses, are difficult to quantify and rely on stimuli that are usually much greater than those involved in normal function. Moreover, in many instances, they do not distinguish disorders in the central nervous system from those in the vestibular apparatus itself. Recent experiments suggest that superconducting magnetometers, or SQUIDs, can detect magnetic signals from the organ of balance. Such measurements may probe vestibular function directly, without complicating effects from the central nervous system. The magnetic signals may also provide a quantitative measure of vestibular response over the full range of stimuli. Such information is potentially useful in basic research, and may ultimately be used in the training and selection process of Air Force personnel. During Phase I, we propose to verify that the observed magnetic effects actually arise from the organ of balance. In Phase II, we will develop new instrumentation and demonstrate the potential of this new technique for application in research, clinical diagnois, and air and space flight.",

        "abstract": "Optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) have long been used by the Navy for detecting mines, submarines, and other buried or concealed ordnance. One of the main problems with OPMs is that their readings depend on their orientation with respect to the earth's magnetic field. When the magnetometer is mounted in a moving pltaform, this so-called heading error significantly reduces the sensitivity of the magnetic measurements. In certain orientations, OPMs fail to operate altogether, and these so-called dead zones restrict the practical utility of the magnetometer. We propose to develop an OPM with no dead zones and greatly reduced heading errors. The new instrument will have a sensitivity approaching that of superconducting SQUID magnetometers, but will require no cryogenic technology. These advances will be achieved in part through a unique, proprietary variation of the basic optical pumping experiment. During Phase I, we will demonstrate this orientation-independent measurement process, and design a full-scale prototype that will be demonstrated during Phase II.",

Recent experiments at the University of California, Berkeley, and here at Quantum Magnetics have shown that SQUIDs can be used to detect radiofrequency nuclear magnetic signals. This opens up the possibility of using SQUIDs to do magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly at low fields and frequencies. SQUID detection would make possible a variety of advances including (1) increased image contrast using very low applied fields, (2) enhanced sensitivity for heavy nuclei such as 14N, 13C and 31 P, (3) MRI systems that operate at a wide range of frequencies, and (4) low-cost MRI systems using inexpensive low- field magnets. SQUID MRI systems will be cost effective with conventional low-Tc SQUIDs, and it will be even less expensive as good high-Tc SQUIDs become available. In Phase I, we will detect nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals from samples using a SQUID. It is anticipated that the results will prove that a SQUID MRI system is feasible. Having considerable expertise in NMR and NMR instrumentation and being a world leader in SQUID technology, we are uniquely positioned to develop a SQUID MRI system.",

        "abstract": "Though it is now the diagnostic tool of choice in a wide range of clinical situations, the actual usage of MRI is limited by its expense even in relatively prosperous communities. High-field MRI capital equipment costs range upward from approximately $1,000,000. Installation and operating costs are also high. MRI signals are stronger, and the resulting images have better spatial resolution at higher magnetic fields. Unfortunately, higher-field MRI instruments are more expensive to build, install, and operate. High spatial resolution is not always necessary, and low-field MRI can provide better contrast between dissimilar tissues. We will develop a fundamentally new technique for magnetic imaging at low fields. We will also develop a new approach to the design of the electronics package, yielding better sensitivity than conventional low-field MRI combined with dramatically lowered costs. Installation and infrastructure requirements would also be reduced. Such a system has the potential for extending the health benefits of MRI to those who are simply not able to afford the cost of using a conventional system, currently most of the world's population. Since the U. S. is a leader in MRI production, the commercial value of expanding the MRI market into the less-developed countries of the world would also be substantial.",

Recent advances in various branches of radiofrequency spectroscopy have made NQR imaging feasible in a few selected materials. More complex biologically significant compounds such as amino acids, polypeptides and proteins have yet to be studied. In this program, we will characterize the nitrogen NQR response of selected amino acid based materials.

A key to valid clinical trial results is the accurate submission of data from the distributed clinical center to the research base. Patients must be followed carefully according to protocol, and accurate data must be submitted in a timely fashion. A data management computer system can help these efforts by keeping track of protocol requirements for individual patients, by ensuring that data is received by the research base in a timely manner through electronic submission, by increasing the accuracy of data entered on case report forms through on-line data entry with edit checks and table lookups, and by allowing various other time saving features such as automatic patient lists and accrual and other reports.

THE USE OF HIGHER-FREQUENCY SOURCES PROVIDES LITTLE HELP, BECAUSE ATTENUATION LIMITS THE DISTANCES OVER WHICH HIGH-FREQUENCY SEISMIC WAVES CAN PROPAGATE. BASED ON RESEARCH WITH SIMILAR PROBLEMS IN THE AREAS OF UNDERWATER ACOUSTICS AND RADAR, AN EXPERIMENT IN CROSSWELL TOMOGRAPHIC IMAGING IS PLANNED USING A NEW CLASS OF WAVEFORMS KNOWN AS CHAOTIC WAVEFORMS. A CHAOTIC WAVEFORM REPRESENTS THE RESPONSE OF A NNLINEAR SYSTEM THAT IS APERIODIC AND DEPENDS ON THE INITIAL CONDITIONS OF THE SYSTEM. UNLIKE TRADITIONAL FREQUENCY MODULATED (FM) SWEEPS WHICH ARE NARROWBAND AT ANY GIVEN INSTANCE OF TIME, A CHAOTIC WAVEFORM IS BROADBAND OVER ITS ENTIRE DURATION, RESULTING IN A SHARPER AMBIGUITY FUNCTION. UNLIKE RANDOM OR PSEUDORANDOM NOISE, A CHAOTIC WAVEFORM CAN BE GENERATED BY A SEISMIC SOURCE AND TUNED FOR A SPECIFIC FREQUENCY BAND. MODEL STUDIES INDICATE THAT THE CHAOTIC SOURCE WAVEFORM WILL IMPROVE THE RESULTING SEISMIC IMAGE. THIS EXPERIMENT WILL COMPARE THE RECONSTRUCTED TOMOGRAPHIC IMAGES PRODUCED BY THE CHAOTIC WAVEFORM, AN FM SLIDE, AND AN IMPULSE. WELLS SELECTED FOR THIS EXPERIMENT ARE SEPARATED BY 330 FT. THE TEST WILL COVER THE DEPTH RANGE OF 2400 TO 2700 FT, WHICH INCLUDES CRETACEOUS LIMESTONES AND SHALES FROM THE AUSTIN CHALK, EAGLE FORD, AND BUDA FORMATIONS.",

The technique beamforms on the narrowband postdespread GPS signal. The narrow bandwidth of the postdespread signal allows low processor update rates and commensurate savings in the processor's complexity, A/D converter speed (only 132 KHz required), A/D converter dynamic range, system cost and size. Extremely high platform rotation (lOOOo/Second) rates are tolerated by allowing extra degrees of freedom in the beamformer to account for signal aperture smearing (the aperture now lies in a plane as opposed to a line). The processor measures interference and SOI power present in an IKHz despread bandwidth allowing 1 KHz weight update rates even with fast or agile pulsed jammers impinging on the array pre-despread. The beamformer simply removes that portion of the pulsed jammer which remains post-despread within the IKHz bandwidth. The beamformer adaption time is effectively instantaneous if a one milli-second digital latency delay is added to the system. The technique converges to the theoretical maximum obtainable SINR for a given jammer/satellite geometry.",

        "abstract": "An SBIR project is proposed here to develop novel techniques for directive and retrodirective LPI/AJ communications, by using blind adaptation algorithms to adjust the array weights on the receive and transmit paths of a communication system. The proposed processor has the capability to automatically extract signals from the received environment, and to transmit signals back to the signal source using an antenna pattern that is either maximally directed towards the communication source (A/J mode), or directed towards the communicator and away from the other emitters in the environment (LPI mode). The processor can accomplish this adaptation without special-purpose antennas, special sensor geometries, or receiver calibration data to set the reception or transmission arrays. The processor is specifically designed to be used in conjunction with LPI (pseudonoise DS and hybrid FH/DS) modulation formats. The objective of this SBIR project is to demonstrate the utility of blind directive/retrodirective communications for a full-duplex air-to-air/ground communication link. The technique development and evaluation will determine the performance of the system configurations under realistic conditions, using computer simulations. The evaluation will also include an assessment of the cost and performance trade-offs in the overall system, with emphasis on minimizing cost at the ground site.tee",

        "abstract": "Within the last six years, ratiometric fluorescent ion indicators such as fura-2 and indo-1 (for calcium), SNARF-1 and BCECF (for pH) together with newer agents to measure sodium, magnesium and potassium have become widely accepted as useful tools to monitor the intracellular environment. More recently, photolabile chelators have been used to control the release or sequestration of cellular modulators such as calcium, cAMP and ATP. Although much of this work has been performed on isolated single cell preparations, there are numerous questions that can be more effectively or conveniently answered by experiments using multicellular preparations, such as tissue strips, rings or isolated organs. However, a major limitation is the lack of equipment designed specifically to make both fluorescence and mechanical measurements on these preparations. This is surprising since multicellular preparations have been a mainstay in physiological and pharmacological research for decades. To address this need, a ratiometric tissue fluorometer will be constructed to allow utilization of many of the currently available ratiometric and non-ratiometric fluorescent probes, alone and in combination. The system will be instrumented to permit simultaneous measurements of fluorescence of one for more indicators and developed force or perfusion pressure/flow, together with control of preload, addition of drugs and bath wash cycles. The fluorometer will be demonstrated in both smooth and cardiac muscle preparations, which have temporal cation responses that span the range of multicellular preparations.",

Once fully implemented, hybridization sequencing will result in a reduction in the cost-per-base by at least an order of magnitude compared with currently employed methods. Much of that savings will be realized through the elimination of materials and labor required for DNA sequencing using conventional gel-based approaches. In addition, further gains in throughput will be realized from the elimination of a number of limitations imposed by gel-based sequencing methods. As it is currently being developed, hybridization sequencing is flawed in several respects. First, it requires the synthesis of at least 65,536 interrogation probes, limiting the practical application of the technology to high-cost \"DNA chip\"-based products. Second, due to the size of DNA fragments targeted for interrogation, control over what is known as the \"branching\" problem is seriously impaired. This impairment gives rise to unacceptably high probabilities of failure. We will use an alternative approach in which a total of only 2048 probes are required to interrogate kilobase-size fragments with a very high probability of success. The method is compatible with both \"DNA chip\" and hybridization membrane technologies. Once developed, the hybridization sequencing product will be extremely cost-effective and immediately applicable to even small, modestly-equipped laboratories.",

The tracers are save, compatible with existing fuel systems, and have extremely low limits of detection: we estimate that a 10,000 gallon tank will require as little as one gram of the tracer. The detection method allows for a simple, solid-state, field-portable instruments, which speeds analysis and lowers the cost of the system. TDA has identified a family of similar but distinguishable tracers, so that a leak can be traced to a particular tank. In Phase I, TDA will test candidate tracer materials to establish their limit of detection, measure their fuel/water partition coefficient, demonstrate their rapid transport through soil, and define the overall system performance and projected cost.

These catalysts show an extraordinary ability to enantioselectively catalyze a number of different organic reactions, allowing the convenient synthesis of a number of otherwise difficult to obtain enantioenriched materials. These catalysts are excellent candidates for commercialization, showing high yields, enantioselectivities, and turnover numbers, and a degree of ruggedness which permits catalyst recovery and reuse. The specific aims for Phase I are (1) To transfer the technology for catalyst production and use from the Doyle laboratories to Regis, and to prepare scaled up quantities of the catalysts Rh2(5R-MEPY)4 and Rh2(5S-MEPY)4 for use in application studies, (2) to use these catalysts to prepare selected products of cyclopropanation and intramolecular C-H insertion reactions, and (3) to use chiral chromatography as a tool to upgrade the products of these reactions from high enantioenrichm- ent to enantiopurity. Phase I and Phase II grants will provide an opportunity to demonstrate the utility of the Doyle technology for the commercial production of highly useful enantiopure organic intermediates and pharmaceutical products.",

The test will require no user operations except to place the device in the sample.

Inhibition of these growth factors could inhibit tumor growth. The project is based on the preliminary observations that polysulfated carbohydrate derivatives, such as pentosan polysulfate, and polysulfated aromatic compounds, such as suramin, inhibit FGF activity and suppress the growth of cancer cells. Initial observations also indicate that heparin-like molecules are required for FGF activity. Specifically, we will synthesize related compounds from carbohydrates with FGF inhibitory activity.

Lactobionic acid is an essential component of perfusion solutions used to preserve organs for transplantation (Sumimoto, 1990). It functions as an impermeant and calcium chelator as well as a reducing agent. These solutions also contain other reducing components such as glutathione which are susceptible to oxidation. Current commercial formulations of lactobionic acid probably contain levels of peroxides which adversely effect the redox potential of the perfusion solution. Any oxidant present limits the shelf storage time and effectiveness of the perfusion solution. This proposal is based on the observation that lactobionic acid contains small amounts of oxidants (probably peroxides) which are formed during its manufacture. Specifically, we will monitor peroxide and other oxidants formation during the electrochemical conversion of lactose to lactobionic and develop techniques to eliminate them from the finished product. New formulations will be evaluated in an in-vitro working heart model. The advantage of an oxidant free lactobionic acid would be enhanced preservation capabilities such as shelf storage time, extend time limitations of preserved organs and hence, provide better functioning organs at the time of transplantation.",

Conversion of FO to these end products requires steps of the pyrimidine path way different from those for FU. The required enzymes in combination are reported to be 10x more active in tumor than in normal cells, and on this basis FO should have a good therapeutic index. FO does not readily enter human cells because of its negatively charged carboxylate anion. Esterifying it with acyloxyalkylester derivatives will allow entry into cells, where this group is readily removed and releases FO for rapid conversion to the toxic end products.

The generator will consist of a solid support (polystyrene or agarose) to which a beta-CIT precursor is covalently attached by means of an alkyl tin linker chain. When a solution of electrophilic iodine (I2) is passed through this solid phase, electrophilic iododestannylation will occur, releasing the iodinated ligand. Since unreacted precursor remains attached to the solid support, this technology should produce carrier free beta-CIT that will not require HPLC purification before use. Oxidation of I- to I2 will occur within the generator. If successful, this product will greatly simplify the production of radioiodinated beta-CIT, thereby making this agent more readily available to SPECT centers worldwide. Additionally, the technology could be extended to other SPECT agents that currently require specialized chemical expertise to produce.",

SIC/AL will be evaluated for card holder and chip carrier. Comparison will be make with more recent composite concepts including glass matrix composites and particulate diamond substituting for SIC. The Phase I study will show through analysis and experimentation, composite properties that are expected for each application. The potential for composite utilization will be assessed both for individual components and multiple composite components in a single electronic package. Potential impact on system capability, reliability and weight/volume savings will be assessed. Of particular interest is a module with all components tailored to chip CTE.

Reticular Systems, Inc., is proposing to investigate the application of intelligent agent technology, an area of distributed artificial intelligence which builds networks of communicating and cooperating agents that address the difficulties of complex systems that must solve problems using limited communications bandwidth. Reticular Systems, Inc., proposes the use of an intelligent agent that will handle the reprogramming workload aboard the spacecraft or satellite. This agenti is specifically designed to handl the problems involved in on-board spacecraft reprogramming. The agent will handle communications with the ground and intelligently modify the code of the on-board expert system. A ground-based reprogramming agent will be used in developed software changes and updates. Reticular Systems, Inc., proposes to implement the reprogramming techniques and technologies in a small prototype system similar to systems found aboard spacecraft and satellites, using a prototypical expert system to verify the reprogramming techniques, and develop figures of merit.",

This is particularly the case in application domains where many variations of similar systems are generated. Command and control systems, such as those in CECOM, are specially good examples. Reusable requirements need to have the following properties. They must use standard domain-oriented vocabularies, they must identify the common requirements to all systems in the family, and they must identify the portions of the requirements that vary between different system variations. In addition those variations must include rationale for choosing them over the other alternatives, including tradeoff and risk assessment information. Such requirements should be catalogued using techniques such as faceted classification, be composable, and be easily estended. This a proposal to assess the current state of requirements reusability and define a requirements methodology and set of tools that foster requirements reuse. The proposed requirements method will stress techniques for constructing and reusing requirements, such as domain analysis, OOA, and issue-based techniques. As part of the Phase I objectives, we will also define an architecture for an environment to support the methodology and promote automated requirements reuse.",

        "abstract": "This project involves a study with a gas-injected plasma focus facility intended to develop the database to design and build an optimized 1-MJ focus. The ultimate objective is to demonstrate the feasibility and attractiveness of this concept for very high specific impulse space propulsion. Studies include scaling experiments with an existing 10-kJ device and construction of a prototype 250-kJ module representing one of four such modules for this 1-MJ facility. The focus concept employs jxB plasma acceleration to generate thrust in a manner similar to the conventional Magneto Plasma Dynamic (MPD) thruster. However, the focus has the added advantage of generating additional thrust from fusion energy released during the pinch phase of the arc rundown. Experiments proposed include studies of electrode dimensional effects, variation of performance with outer electrode flow passage size, and alternate gas injection points. The prototype module will be used to study optimum power generation and transfer to the thruster electrodes. The data will provide a parametric basis for optimizing thrust generation and for the scale-up to larger energy devices. This will enable the design of an optimized 1-MJ facility planned for Phase II of the study.",

In order to increase impact, the majority of the media messages include local data and local references. During Phase II the impact will be tested in a true experiment with blocking and random assignment of 20 pairs of communities. The immediate goals of the media campaign will be to change the following attitudes: (1) perceive harm, (2) perceived parental sanctions against drinking, (3) peer encouragement to drink, (4) peer sanctions against drinking, (5) social acceptability of drinking, and (6) perceived parent/child communication about drinking. Pre-post tests will assess effect on these attitudes and on alcohol use of 7th through 12 graders.",

We will develop and test a quantification technique based on a three dimensional, non-contact, optical range sensing device, originally developed for commercial portrait sculpture and adapted for medical use. This technique defines the entire surface of the head and face as opposed to the manual method of measuring surface points or facial landmarks. The method allows quantitative volume measurements. The 3D Surface Scanner features 360 degree surface coverage of a subjects's head, and sub-second data acquisition rate that makes it suitable for scanning children as well as adults. This device employs \"white light\" pattern projectors, but it does not employ harmful ionizing radiation. The cost of a scan with this technology will be substantially less than that of alternative means of collecting 3D data sets, such as by CT or MR scanning. The existing prototype 3D Surface Scanner will be improved in both accuracy and surface quality.

Real-Time capabilities will include abnormal event processing, RT/FT events and on-line system monitoring and control. The resulting system will have the ability to compose, integrate and monitor the performance of software modules in a variety of domains, particularly real-time distributed applications. The research will also formalize the mathematical semantics of the system, using partial-ordering constructs (directed acyclic graphs) and temporal logic semantics. We will utilize an existing distributed real-time spreadsheet package (ControlCalc from RTware, Inc.) designed specifically for process control and monitoring. The Polylith (Purtilo, 1991) system will be used for interfacing software modules. The RTD-MIF will use MIF capabilities to generalize and extend its existing ability to manage and analyze real-time date, events and distributed processes in diverse environments. Deliverables: 1)Detailed design document for extending Polylith into an RTD-MIF. 2)Formal mathematical semantics of an RTD-MIF. 3)Prototype implementation of Polylith-based RTD-MIF. 4)Design and implement a subset of a running RTD-MIF application based on a distributed, real-time spreadsheet.",

This represents simultaneously a critical technology area for Defense and a multi-billion dollar market opportunity. Basic technology feasibility for FEDs has been amply demonstrated already. The remaining questions are those of engineering and economics. Improvements are needed most in spacer technology, low energy phosphors, and cathodes. LETI proved that current phosphors are at least adequate, if not ideal, for the time being; and the MCC/SI Diamond Team has recently developed a major breakthrough in diamond cold cathode fabrication and performance. This leaves high field spacer technology prominently exposed on the critical path to FED commercialization. We propose herein to demonstrate an affordable, reliable approach to fabricating and installing high performance spacers for Field Emitter Displays. Failure mechanisms in current spacers are fairly well understood, and presumabley one can improve spacer performance by any number of brute force routes. We shall confine the Phase I Program, however, to identifying economical solutions that support rapid market entry, consistent quality and high volume production. Phase II will focus on setting up pilot scale production based upon the Phase I results. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: Improved spacers will help enable a new generation of flat panel display technology, Field Emitter Displays. FEDs will serve advanced computer, telecommunicaions and entertainment applications in the consumer market, as well as avionics, CCCI and general hi-rel applications in Defense.",

        "abstract": "Foods are dehydrated to make them more easily packaged and stored at room temperature. The removal of water reduces the opportunity for harmful chemical reactions. Dehydrated food powders and particles are also used in \"liquid meals\" for dental patients. However, dehydrated foods traditionally have been difficult to rehydrate and are of relatively poor quality. The reasons for these difficulties are from thermal damage due to the high temperatures necessary to dehydrate the foods. A process useful for heat sensitive foods, which is presently being used ty the U.S. Army for their dehydration needs, is freeze drying. Freeze drying, although effective, has its drawbacks. Freeze drying is a very expensive process involving high capital costs and high energy cost. S.R. Taylor and Associates proposes an alternative method to do dehydration for the U.S. Army. Ultrasonic drying has been proven effective for certain types of heat-sensitive materials, such as many fresh foods. Phase I will determine which food-types would be appropriately dried ultrasonically, and at which processing variables. Phase II would involve process optimization for the highest quality dried rehydrated product at the lowest cost. S.R. Taylor and Associates has actively been involved in developing a novel ultrasonic flexural plate design to deliver a highly axisymmetric sound beam into gaseous and liquid media. This unique flexural plate will produce the desired sound wave pattern to enhance food dehydration at unharmful temperatures and conditions.",

Our Biopsychometric Signal Acquisition and Processing System (BSAPS) will utilize state-of-the-art data acquisition hardware and will provide PC-based software control over recording characteristics. The system will provide up to 32 channels for collecting EEG and other physiological signals and an additional 16 channels for collecting stimulus and behavioral event data from training simulators or other devices, as well as high-level physiological signals such as respiration. A fast application electrode positioning system, analog preamplification with telemetry of the head, and user-programmable DSP filtering and analysis capabilities will be included in the design. The BSAPS will consist of a hat with active electrodes and telemetry, a paper-back book-sized amplifier/filter/digitizer box, and a laptop PC with DSP processor and large, ruggedized hard disk. The platform will allow for real-time EEG artifact detection and removal to minimize signal contaminants prior to data analysis. The result of this development would be a small, low-cost, flexible, user-friendly, physiological data acquisition and processing system for use in naturalistic work environments.",

The LUMITOX (R) microbiological assay is a compact laboratory procedure that has been proven effective on all common toxins tested. Specific applications have included mycotoxins, exfoliates, insecticides, waterbottom sediments (Chukchi Sea), marine antifouling paints, and oil-well drilling fluids. The procedure has demonstrated a variation of less than 10%, sensitivity to a few parts per million, and effectiveness in darkly colored and turbid media. At its present stage of development, in the laboratory LUMITOX (R) yields results in a few hours, rather than the days required for existing bioassays. A project is under way to isolate the test organism's operative enxymes in order to develop a field-testing reagent. Design and construction of portable device consisting of a sample chamber, agitator, photodiode, metering circuit (also patented, U.S. Patent #4,689,305-1987), and LED or other readout mode also are necessary to complete a portable field toxicity testing unit, which as obvious potential for both military and civilian environmental applications.",

From such distributions, exposure parameters such as SPTA (spatial peak-temporal average) and SATA (spatial average-temporal average) can be determined. In this approach, ultrasonic field is visualized directly on the plate as the liquid crystal molecules are reoriented by the ultrasonic field from their initial unidirectional orientation. Then, an electric field is applied to restore the orientation of the molecules. The magnitude of the restoring electric field is then used to determine the sonographic exposure parameters. The approach offers several advantages over presently used hydrophone and radiation force balance methods. For example, image of the cross-sectional field distribution is available at once. Moreover, the distribution of temporal average intensity over the plane perpendicular to the propagation axis is available at once from the electric field data. In comparison, the hydrophone method is cumbersome as point-by-point detection of a large number of sample points is needed to determine field distribution. The radiation force balance method, on the other hand, requires an elaborate set-up and provides no information on the spatial distribution of the ultrasonic field.",

The low losses of switched reluctance machines, while operating under high loads and motions of varying direction, suggest that a linear version is uniquely suited for this application. The low losses indicate that it can be compactly packaged into an active suspension relative to other electric actuators without risk of overheating. Combining the LRM with the similar compactness and low loss of pulse width modulation inverters and the flexibility of a DSP-based controller permits development of an all-electric suspension which is compact, reliable, user adjustable, and adaptable to changing road or terrain conditions. Furthermore, the energy absorbed by the proposed suspension system during operation may be recovered rather than dissipated as heat, significantly improving fuel economy. During Phase I Satcon proposes to design a complete suspension system, including the LRM actuator, the drive electronics, and the programmable controller, such that various suspension control algorithuis could be easily implemented. In addition, SatCon will fabricate and test a small-scale LEN, to demonstrate the remarkable high force-to-loss ratio of this type of machine.",

A motor which does not require liquid lubricant would be even more desirable since the inlet area of turboshaft engines is a difficult one for the installation of lines. SatCon proposes to develop a flux-concentrating permanent-magnet brushless motor and its associated controller as an IPS blower motor. This motor design makes the best use of advanced magnetic materials technology since the total weight and power consumption of components is critical. The electronic interface design will make use of either AC or DC (28 V or 270 V) primary power to determine the optimum approach for minimum size and weight. A maximum weight of five pounds has been established. Oilless bearings based on solid lubricant or an advanced bearing grease will be used. During Phase I, SatCon will generate a preliminary design for the motor and electronic drive system using the T800 engine. During Phase II, SatCon will detail design, fabricate, and bench test the IPS electric blower. Testing will simulate T800 IPS operation over full engine operating range.",

SatCon Technology Corporation proposes to develop innovative blade design concepts using smart material/structures to meet this requirement by substantially enhancing the maneuver capability of the rotor. These concepts, consisting of piezoelectric, electro-strictive, magnetostrictive and other advanced actuators integrated into the blade design, would allow individual control of the rotor blades. This approach will improve operability by improving maneuverability, agility, and speed; improve supportability by increasing reliability; and improve survivability by decreasing signature (noise and vibration). Phase I will identify and compare advanced and innovative blade design concepts using smart materials/structures which enhance the maneuver capability without performance and weight penalties. The most promising concepts which are representative of current future technology will be traded-off considering both benefits and disadvantages in terms of attributes such as rotor performance, weight, and complexity. In Phase II additional evaluation of the most promising concepts will be performed to verify benefits and disadvantages. A 10-ft. diameter scale model of the most promising concept will be fabricated and tested to validate the theoretical predictions.",

At arcjet nozzle operating temperatures, the emissivity of an uncoated tungsten nozzle is approximately 0.4. When coated with a material having an emissivity of 0.55-0.6, the nozzle temperature is reduced by 120C, due to enhanced radiative cooling. The proposed program will investigate potential emissivity coating with radiation coefficients up to 0.8-0.9. The use of such coatings can reduce nozzle operating temperatures, leading to longer anode life. Enhanced radiative cooling will also provide wider engine design latitude and improved operating power margins.",

The component technology elements required to integrate the EM analysis of coupling to cavities with circuits are already available. What is proposed here is the integration of the disparate analysis techniques and algorithms into one easy to operate and apply analysis tool. We propose to accomplish this through the judicious selection on new and available technology which will form the core program elements of the new integrated code. A user friendly operating shell will then be developed which will allow the analyst to easily specify the parameters of a problem and command solution and analysis of the problem through simple on-screen menu selections. The resulting integrated fields and circuits coupling code will be designed as a thoroughly modular program, making the later addition of new features straight-forward.",

This concept allows for EOD at a safe distance . which minimizes the risk to personnel. A shortcoming of the MODS is the inability to neutralize munitions that are out of the line-of-sight. An optical fiber waveguide can be exploited to transfer the laser energy to non-line-of-sight locations thus improving the efficiency of the MODS along with enhancing the safety of the operators. SEA will demonstrate the deliv- ery of high power Nd:YAG energy through a long length of optical fiber to shDw the feasibility of such a system. The eventual system, however, must be able to deliver high powers, be able to withstand the riRors of field deployment, and be disposable due to the catastrophic nature of the neutral- ization method. To achieve this ultimate task, SEA has developed a simple, inexpensive, expendable cable design which combines the power delivery fiber optic waveguide, an illumination waveguide, and a visualization system into one unit. The design incorporates the Fiber Optic Microcable (FOMC), developed by the Navy, which utilizes state-of-the-art coating technology to fortify the optical cable.",

        "abstract": "Science & Engineering International Corporation (SEIC) is proposing to develop a metal plating technology based on nanocompsite chromium for gun barrels and other interior surfaces of military hardware. Use of nanocomposite chromium plating will greatly improve wear, erosion, and corrosion resistance of interior surfaces of gun barrel that are exposed to propellant combustion and other adverse effects of interior ballistics. The proposed technique applied to a number of different surfaces, has been demonstrated to produce coatings that are more than two times harder, have two times better wear resistance and have significantly better adhesion that standard hard chromium plating techniques. It was also demonstrated that the new method does not increase substantially the cost of the plating process. The proposed technology is base on properties of unique material: nanosize diamond powder that is formed by cubic diamond particles. This material has become available only recently. The addition of nanosize diamond to electrolyte allows for the significant decrease in the grain size of the electroplated chromium coating a vast improvement in of the quality of the coated layers.",

Bichromatic imaging utilizes an array of light sources. Each light source contains at least two wavelength components that are temporally correlated with one another. The presence of lesions, whose absorption and/or scattering properties differ from those of the surrounding tissue, can be determined from observation of the light transmitted through the tissue. Scans of duration 1 sec will be adequate to detect mm-size lesions in a 40-mm-thick breast.

The synthesis and delivery of 15O-labeled compounds poses a unique challenged due to the extremely short half-life of this isotope and the requirement for multiple sequential doses in many procedures. This project will address the need for safe, convenient automated 15O-labeled radiopharmaceutical synthesis and patient administration. In Phase I, the key system components and automation required for production of 15O-labeled O2, CO, H2O, and butanol will be developed. Three innovative technologies will make possible a higher degree of system compactness and automation than previously achieved: an efficient, rapidly heated charcoal furnace, an in-line positron-sensitive radioactivity monitor, and a sensor for monitoring filter integrity in the final dose filtration step. The system will be housed in a self-shielded bedside unit and will allow automated, unassisted patient infusion of the liquid radiochemicals, thus, greatly reducing radiation dose to administering personnel. A simple user interface which can be controlled by the PET scanner operator will allow optimal scheduling of dose production and delivery. Phase I will culminate in the design of a system to be fabricated and tested in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "An innovative imaging technique is proposed for surface/wafer temperature measurement in a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reactor. Limitations in measuring absolute, as well as relative temperature in a CVD reactor, limit the ability to utilize intelligent processing of material, including feedback or forward control of the CVD process. Comparison of the ratios of spectral radiance at several wavelengths to the theoretical ratios of intensity derived from Planck's radiation law allows the evaluation of absolute temperature indepdent of the absolute photo flux. Current multiple-wavelength pyrometry, event though able to overcome the wavelength dependency of emissivity, is handicapped by its inability to measure radiance at multiple wavelengths simultaneously. The proposed technique uses an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF) to rapidly obtain multiple spectral radiance information. Under Phase I, the proposed temperature measuring system will be developed and optimized to improve the scanning rate, bandpass and signal-to-noise ratio. Under Phase II, the developed temperature measuring system will be applied in conjunction with an intelligent process control technique to a material process, such as the growth of InP or GaAs in a CVD reactor. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: The system (thermal sensor and process control) developed would have a significant commercial impact on increasing quality control of electronic, photonic, aerospace and high strength materials.",

The long-term goal is to provide a precise and accurate integration of the available evidence on self-management training programs for children with asthma. In an effort to establish the technical merit and feasibility of this approach, Phase I will conduct a meta-analytic statistical integration of the evidence in a delimited segment of this research domain. It is projected that during Phase II, the effort will be expanded to include the remaining outcome measures and types of programs not examined in Phase I. The Phase II report will summarize and integrate all of the available evidence on self-management training programs for children with asthma. These results will allow us to distill the available evidence into a template for the design of the most effective self-management training programs for asthmatic children.

As a result, the device technology has matured so that power levels, and lifetimes are more than adequate for many practical applications.

With this impressive device capability more and more applications are emerging and the emphasis is now shifting to the optical and thermal management systems which can best take advantage of the high brightness and power levels. For optical management, one attractive option is fiber coupling. Fibers offer a simple, inexpensive, low loss method for delivering optical power in a way that preserves the intensity and brightness of the source and at the same time offers a wide range of architectural options for subsequent systems which spectrally, spatially or temporally reformat the power. For thermal control microchannel coolers have been demonstrated with thermal impedance less than .015 C/(W/cm2). SDL proposes to assess DoD and commercial applications for fiber coupled sources in the 50 to 100 Watt average power range and develop a design based on the 100 Watt bar, a 600 micron fiber link, and microchannel cooling.",

By functionally decomposing the requirements of environmental monitoring we can apply emerging technologies to fulfill these modularized requirements. Ten (10) years of experience indicate that the technologies directly applicable to specific requirements are: Artificial Neural Networks, Fuzzy Logic, Artificial Intelligence, and Object-oriented Database Management Systems. We feel that to successfully develop a system using such diverse technologies, the major tecnical problem is the integration of these modules. By functionally decomposing the requirement the hybrid system can be build in a modular, objectoriented manner. This ensures that the best, effective technology has been applied to the respective requirement. Any new technological advances can then be easily integrated into the hybrid system. Scientists presently involved in environmental research, ANN, AI, Fuzzy Logic, data comparison, and advanced system engineering will be used. These personnel will apply existing designs which successfully resolved similar problems in their respective technologies, minimizing risk of completion while leveraging available funds. GEOPHYSICS, a commercial environmental firm, has expressed a strong desire to use and comercialize the Environmental monitoring System to support their own business and profession.",

Conventional passive approaches to improving performance as measured by one set of metrics often degrade performance as measured by other metrics. These are the fundamental performance trades that confront aircraft designers. A need exists for a rapid, efficient, and reliable methodology for multivariable FCS evaluation at an early stage in the development process in order to reduce risk during flight simulation and flight testing. During this Phase I SBIR effort Seagull Technology will (1) design a multivariable control law for the F/A-18A that improves performance during maneuvers and (2) construct a rigorous proof of concept procedure. Three objectives will be accomplished during this work: (1) problem formulation, (2) FCS control design for the F/A-18A, and (3) proof of concept test formulation. The problem formulation will include uncertainity and variation in the aircraft dynamics, and a matrix of maneuvers and agility and maneuverability metrics. The FCS design will use a vultivariable design technique. The proof of concept test formulation will provide a blueprint for rigorous and reliable evaluation of multivariable controllers.",

Although there has been significant progress in developing composibility techniques, there is little experience with using these techniques. Thus, the set of problems to which the techniques are applicable and the amount of effort required to apply the techniques are unclear. The proposed project will examine the applicability of these techniques to computer security problems such as analyzing 1) distributed security enforcement, 2) assured pipelines for trusted subsystems, and 3) covert channels in distributed systems. For each of these potential problem areas, it is necessary to investigate the value of composibility both for synthesis and refinement. Instances in which composibility simplifies synthesis provide the basis for a library of reusable secure components. Instances in which composibility simplifies refinement suggest the use of modular decomposition to simplify security analysis. Based on deficiencies identified from this investigation, we will develop approaches for addressing the deficiencies. In summary, the goals of the proposed project are to 1) determine the problem areas to which composibility techniques are applicable and 2) address deficiencies in the prior work.",

The work consists of upgrading an existing computer program that tests the degree to which a patient is oriented. The upgrades consist of adding pre- and post-processing modules for use by the therapist to provide input and quantitatively evaluate patient progress. Graphics will be added and additional conversations will be written.

The new approach is called SAM1 (for Semiempirical ab initia Method Version 1). SAM1 is different from present methods in that it explicitly computes two-electron repulsion integrals via a minimum Gaussian basis set, bringing new theoretical rigor to the NDDO model on which such successful techniques as AM1 and MNDO are based. Many of the aspects that make seimempirical methods so attractive and useful to such a wide audience (i.e. speed and implicit accounting for electron correlation) are retained in SAM1. We propose here to expand and apply the SAM1 method to a variety of new elements and to test its performance on the prediction of chemical phenomena. Parameter sets for carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), and iodine (I) have already been derived. We will expand this set of elements to sulfur (S), phosphorous (P), silicon (Si), arsenic (As), and copper (Cu), allowing SAM1 to be applied to a wide range of chemistry including the processes of life, materials science, and many reactions of industrial importance.

Our innovation is to use multiple quantum-wells in the AlGaAsSb/InGaAsSb materials systems in the design of MOPA mid-infrared semiconductor diode lasers. In Phase I, we would develop design rules for the quantum wells and optical structures and design a complete MOPA structure for the 3.3 um emission, a key wavelength for methane gas (CH4) detection. In Phase II, we would take advantage of our ongoing materials research with expitaxial layers of AlGaAsSb and InGaAsSb and fabricate a working MOPA laser for 3.3 um. We would optimize the power output and beam quality of this device and then apply this know-how to other wavelengths for gas spectroscopy, such as 4.2 um (carbon dioxide) and 4.6 um (carbon monoxide).

The research will include both process modeling and hardware development. At present, quantitative temperature measurement using optical emission is possible only if the thermal emissivity is known. The innovation will be the incorporation of novel emissivity models into a compact NIR spectral radiometer. The core of the spectrometer will be a dielectric stack \"wedge\" filter used with an InGaAs photodiode array. Our goal will be a measurement accuracy of 1oC at 1 Hz repetition rates during both low and high temperature (50-1000oC) CVD. Feasibility will be demonstrated during Phase I by utilizing the modeling with a grating-based InGaAs photodiode array spectrometer featuring no moving parts and rapid spectral measurement will be developed. This spectrometer will be used to verify the technology on actual CVD systems. The modeling activity will be performed with the collaboration of the New Jersey Institute of Technology as a benefit of their DARPA ManTech program \"Multi-Wavelength Imaging Pyrometry for Semiconductor Process Monitoring and Control (F33615-92-C-5817). ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: The RF and gaseous environments in CVD reactors makes it difficult to accurately measure temperature electronically (thermocouples, thermistors, etc.). The ability to accurately and rapidly measure temperatures from outside the chamber will allow process control techniques to be used to greatly improve manufacturing efficiencies.",

The system will use OM compounds such as triethyl gallium (TEG) and trimethyl indium (TMI) mixed with HC1 to produce volatile chlorides in a hydride-style hot wall reactor. These two features will allow the growth of very thin, abrupt interface layers (an OMVPE advantage) with a high growth rate (about 10um/hr) and low arsine comsumption in a hot-wall system (a hydride advantage). In Phase I, we will (1) modify an existing vapor phase reactor by designing and installing a rapid gas switching manifold, (2) grow 3 nm alternate layers of In.53Ga.47As/InP to demonstrate thin-layer growth capability, and (3) grow and fabricate a 3 um thick In.53Ga.47As detector structure to demonstrate thin-layer growth capability, and (3) grow and fabricate a 3 um thick In.53Ga.47As detector structure to demonstrate overall quality of the materials. We will also submit a design for a compact, low-cost, but flexible merged system.

        "abstract": "A new method is proposed for the development of stable, high speed electro-optic polymers for optical waveguide devices such as switches and couplers. Thin polymer films will be produced by a new process that we refer to as flash evaporation. The process is based on negative electron beam photoresist technology, capable of easily processing thin-film and waveguide structures on various substrates, including silicon. A new family of acrylate monomer materials containing highly nonlinear chromophores will be evaporated in vacuum and poled at room temperature in the liquid state before polymerization by electron-beam cross linking. The film thickness can vary from about 500A Degrees to 5 m, and individually poled multilayer film structures can be constructed. We believe that this unique process is superior to any previous approach for forming EO polymers, and it will enable the fabrication of thin polymer films with a strong polar orientation, superior thermal and mechanical properties and improved aging characteristics.",

Unlike previous candidate vaccines, it appears not to cause potentiated disease. The specific aim is to test the efficacy and safety of BRSV in cotton rats previously administered human RSV antibody in amounts equivalent to those seen in human infants; virtually all potential recipients of an RSV vaccine would be infants possessing substantial amounts of maternally derived antibody to RSV and such an antibody has been shown to block the efficacy of other candidate vaccines.

        "abstract": "MRSI is a noninvasive tool for measuring the spatial distribution of important metabolites in human tissue. MRSI signals are quite weak, so a lengthy data gathering period is required to obtain adequate signal levels from each measurement point. To reduce the total duration of the MRSI session, clinicians usually limit the number of MRSI measurement points. When these limited data are processed, the resulting image lacks contrast and exhibits poor spatial resolution. This poor image quality is believed to be caused by the processing algorithms employed in existing equipment. This effort will develop a different MRSI processing algorithm to improve image quality. Specifically, MRSI sampled data currently are processed using the FFT, which is a computationally efficient method of producing an image. However, the underlying assumptions required by the FFT are not satisfied in MRSI. In particular, MRSI data form frequency-limited records of a spatially finite tissue. For this situation, a different discrete transform based on Prolate Spheroidal Wave Functions (PSWF) is required. PSWF requires more computation than the FFT, but its superior accuracy permits greatly improved resolution from a limited number of measurements. PSWF image transforms for MRSI will lead to robust, automated image processing.",

The study is to minimize \"weak knee\" solderibility problems on the curved radius of plated thru-holes. In addition, the design concept for an automated & ruggedized version of the present SERA tester will be developed. Simpex, with its factory automation expertise, will be integrating and implementing the SERA tester at Cedko Inc.'s printed circuit board manufacturing facility. Understanding the cause of oxidized metallization at \"weak knee\" locations, SERA test data will be collected at five strategic points in the printed circuit board plating line. Procedures specified in Mil-Std-105/E Level II AQL 1.5 will be used for data collection to ensure the largest sample size with minimum labor expenditure. Data collected at these locations will be analyzed to determine the type and amount of oxidation present. These statistical data or oxidation signatures, will in turn, be used to monitor and control the plating processes. In addition to the data collection and interpretation effort, software algorithms will be developed to interpret SERA readings or oxidation signatures in real-time, such that corrective actions can be recommended immediately by the system controller at each of the process control points. From the lessons learned in implementing the SERA tester, the design concept for an automated SERA test station with ruggedized features will be developed. This effort is anticipated to be completed in 6 months.",

The flexible concepts are based on Simula's patented cable armor developed for the Army's M109 Self-Propelled Howitzer and M1A1 Abrams tank. The patented design consists of a series of common interlocking links that thread together to form a flexible cable armor. The rigid concepts involve the use of rigid half-cylinder sections that, when assembled together, completely encase and protect the wiring. We intend to consider conventional ballistic ceramics and composites as well as more advanced materials such as cermets and metal matrix composites and less conventional transparent armors. This effort will be performed by the team of Simula, Inc., and Materials and Electrochemical Research (MER) Corporation.

The instruments and scales that will comprise the CD-ROM will represent the \"best of the field\" and will be chosen with guidance from a National Advisory Panel of experts in gerontology. To facilitate use of the CD-ROM, the disk will also include search and retrieval software to help a user find those portions of the instruments and scales that might be used to measure a given research construct of interest. In addition, a User's Guide to each instrument will provide technical information about the instruments, the scales, and the studies that produced them. The CD-ROM Instrument Archive will organize many years and dollars worth of data collection instruments and scales in a single source. This product should lower the cost of the instrument development phase of the research process, encourage cost-effective reuse of outstanding instruments and scales that work.

        "abstract": "We will test the feasibility of establishing an archive of the most promising teen pregnancy prevention programs that have been developed to date. Each program package will include everything needed to replicate the promising program: textbook, workbook, video, board game, an accompanying evaluation packet with instructions, instruments, and scoring instructions for assessing the effectiveness of the program. Effectiveness will be defined as demonstrated salutary impact on fertility-related behavior (i. e., postponement of sexual intercourse, decrease in frequency of sexual intercourse, decrease in number of sexual partners, increase in contraceptive use at first intercourse, increase in consistent contraceptive use among the sexually active, and prevention of pregnancy and parenthood). For programs aimed at children 15 or younger, demonstrated salutary impact on values and attitudes (perception that the above behaviors are worthwhile and of value) will be accepted as preliminary evidence of effectiveness. Phase I will (1) identify model programs and evaluations, (2) investigate the feasibility of obtaining developers' permission to obtain, process, and market their programs and evaluations, and (3) using one program as a prototype, investigate the feasibility of enhancing both program and evaluation materials to the point of public usability and commercial viability. Phase II will enhance the remaining programs selected during Phase I and will beta-test (implement at an independent site) all programs and their respective evaluation packages. Unmarried teen pregnancy is a problem in many communities across the country, and many pregnancy prevention programs with a variety of approaches and assumptions have been developed and implemented. The products to be created should facilitate cost- effective replication of programs that work, prevent wasted effort spent \"reinventing the wheel\", and encourage ongoing scientific evaluation of programs to ascertain the robustness of each program's effectiveness (or lack thereof) across different study populations. Because of national concern with problems presented by teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, we expect that there will be widespread demand for the program and evaluation material products to be created by this project.",

SofTech will perform this work in conjunction with the Naval initiative for the DBMS Interface Standard Working Group (DISWG). The research will support DISWG needs and promote language standards. In Phase II, we will perform research to extract an RT-DBMS language and engine interface requirements, develop these requirements into language and interface specifications, and verify these developments by demonstrating their use for selected applications. Phase III will translate RT-DBMS queries into the engine interface language, preserving the temporal and spatial constraints expressed in the queries.",

However, a significant limitation of current CASE tool methods is the capturing of just a few perspectives of a system under development while ignoring other relevant information. Each mehtod supported by the tools also tends to be very different and incomplete, covering only one specific view of the system. The Unified Methodology and Toolset (UMT), an innovative solution to this problem, combines the many differents views of a system into a single, consistent information model. The UMT captures different system perspectives by combining a set of methods into a single methodological framework. The framework categorizes the methods to determine the kinds of information collected or omitted. Comprising the framework are a small number of generalized representations modelling the system under development. By storing the information in a centralized database, information ommitted by one method is obtained through other methods. Each peice of information is stored only once within the framework, thus maintaining consistency between methods. Phase I will document the requirements and design of the UMT, demonstrate feasibility, and prototype risk areas.",

The specific aims are 1) extend a previous in-house study to examine the possibility of using coaxial line probes to characterize the reflections between different tissue structures, and 2) test the optimized design using a simple inhomogeneous dielectric phantom. Optimization and characterization of the probe will be accomplished by the use of a previously developed three dimensional finite difference time domain (3D FDTD) computer program. This powerful technique enables us to calculate the fringing field patterns of various probes without assuming aperture field distributions. After a design has proved successful at a theoretical stage, the probe will be interfaced to a Network Analyzer and tested against a layer dielectric phantom. The response of the probe will then be examined for ease of detecting the various reflection coefficients that result from the interfaces. Preliminary experimental data taken for in-vivo skin characterization suggests the study should be commence by optimizing the performance of previously developed probes. However, since the FDTD program is both fast and flexible we anticipate other kinds of applicators will also be examined.",

Optimization of the electromagnetic applicator design will be accomplished by the use of a three dimensional finite difference time domain (3 FDTD) computer program that we have previously developed.

Preliminary experimental data on a 27 MHz magnetic induction applicator in an inhomogeneous phantom gives half power heating at a depth of 5 cm.

        "abstract": "The electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding effectiveness of a material of fixed thickness is a function of the incident wave frequency and the conductivity/permeability product of the shielding material. Effective low frequency shielding requires either a high conductivity/permeability product or a relatively thich piece of material. Current low frequency shielding materials compensate for limited conductivity/permeability values by increasing the thickness of the shielding material, which generally limits their application. This proposal is for the development of a low frequency, flexible EMI shield. To maintain flexibility the shielding material must be quite thin, typically below 20 um, therefore the conductivity/permeability product must be high. We propose to use an amorphous, non-magnetostrictive ferromagnetic alloy in a multilayer structure, with a metallic interlayer, to achieve high permeability and high conductivity. A moderate value coercive force is required to avoid saturation of the shielding material. The design of the multilayer structure will be guided by analytic models developed for modelling shielding effectiveness. Other design issues include selection of substrate and shielding material combinations for superior adhesion, durability, and low cost as well as shielding effectiveness. Promising candidates will be fabricated to demonstrate the feasibility of such products.",

Since power dissipation constitutes a major limitation to increased circuit density in electronic systems, such reduction is mandatory if the potential of 3-d multi-chip module packaging for minimizing size, weight, and power is to be realized. Our basic approach minimizes the switching energy per operation by reducing the supply and threshold voltages from five volts to one-half volt. In order to implement this approach, which involves the use of very small switching voltages, two key problems must be solved: compensation of statistical threshold variations over the surfaces of the chips, and reduction of power supply switching noise. We have devised several techniques for adaptively controlling the threshold voltage by tuning the substrate bias of each well in which a large block of gates is fabricated. We have also developed a variety of packaging and interconnect techniques for noise reduction, including the use of special shielding structures and area-array chip attachments. In Phase II we will design, fabricate and demonstrate a real-time FFT computation engine using ultra-low-power CMOS and advanced multichip module technology. The engine will have an equivalent throughput of 30 GOPS and a power consumption of 1.0 watt. In unpackaged form, it will occupy a volume of only 2.0 cubic centimeters and weigh only 4 grams.",

        "abstract": "SPI has a unique combination of experience in power electronics that will benefit the development of the PCU for Internetted Unattended Ground Sensors (IUGS). We specialize in the development of highly reliable, efficient, compact systems. We have extensive experience in the development of space-use DC-DC converter systems and PCUs for space electric propulsion systems. In dealing with low cost, high volume manufacturing, we have successfully developed and manufactured a converter/limiter for thermoelectric generator. This product outperformed our competitors with its technical performance as well as its low cost. We propose to use our experience to develope a PCU for IUGS that will cost less than $100 for a commercial grade product. This product will be reliable, maintenance free, and output short-circuit protected. If necessary, a power optimization circuit will be incorporated to maximize the power drawn from the sources. In Phase I, we will work with the DARPA technical monitor and other technical staff to study and define the requirements of the PCU. A full scale breadboard unit with built in Phase I to demonstrate the feasibility of the technical approach as well as to provide basis for manufacturing cost estimation. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: The PCU developed in this program will meet the exact requirements of the DARPA IUGS and therefore will directly benefit the development of the IUGS. Since the power requirement of the sensors and the characteristics of the power sources are very similar to other remote sensors for military or commercial uses, we project a broad range of applications and high volume use of the low cost PCU.",

People with MR are increasingly being moved into community settings. Caregivers in the community residences are typically not oral care experts, yet it is they who have responsibility for assuring adequate daily oral hygiene. It has been established that the oral health of those with MR is often poor, and that daily oral hygiene is the best defense against disease. A video training program administered by group home trainers could facilitate an improvement in the caregivers' awareness of the importance of oral hygiene for the clients. Phase I will determine if the videos gain the desired change in knowledge and attitude. Phase II will measure changes in oral health status of the residents using the Oral Health Index (OHI), which is an established method for quantifying oral health. If successful, videos can be sold to schools, group homes, regional facilities, and to parents of those with MR. The relative ease of video training will help increase hygiene awareness and hopefully help to avoid disease in persons with MR.",

        "abstract": "A polymeric membrane style hydrophone is commonly used to calibrate lithotriptors. This commercially available device has a fast rise time and acceptable sensitivity but a very short life span. We propose a new style of hydrophone here that overcomes the longevity problem and yields superior sensitivity. The design employs a spot poled ceramic active element backed by a matched acoustic impedance. This hydrophone will be able to measure pressures as high as 100 MPa for thousands of shocks without any serious degradation in sensitivity or pulse shape. Furthermore, such a hydrophone is expected to reproduce negative (rarefactional) pressure faithfully. Moreover, the proposed technique will gain the benefit of having well defined and potentially very small (less than 0.5 mm diameter) active areas. The new hydrophone is also expected to be used as a versatile tool in precisely mapping the acoustic fields generated by a wide range of therapeutic and diagnostic transducers in common use. Thus the proposed low cost device will have great commercial potential.",

The AN/MPS-36 radars were built in the 1970'x and since their inception have been subject to occasional tracking problems manifested as oscillation of the antenna in azimuth and/or elevation about the true track. In some instances simultaneous oscillation in both axes, or \"spiraling\" is unstable and can result in loss of track. Tests have shown that the AN/MPS-36 five-horn monopulse feed and comparator exhibit severe corss-coupling between the azimuth and elevation error channels in the presence of a cross-polarized component of the received signal. Tracking oscillation can be expected in the presence of this cross-coupling as the tracking servos attempt to correct this problem by replacing the present five-horn feed with a four-horn feed which is free of the cross-polarization errors of the present feed, and replacing or overhauling the parabolic dish.",

        "abstract": "The potential for improvement in the performance of electric rocket motors (arcjets) using methane as a propellant has been limited by sooting or choking and the resulting fouling of the rocket. If its sooting characteristics can be mitigated by rocket motor design or operational conditions, then its use as a propellant gas can be realized. For orbital transfer, we propose to investigate whether operational conditions, particularly preheating of the electric rocket motor, can be used to prevent fouling. For preheating purposes, hydrogen will be used to bring a 14 kw arcjet up to operational temperature. Methane will be introduced as the propellant gas by going through a series of H2/CH4 mixture compositions for 100-percent hydrogen to 100-percent methane. Sooting characteristics will be monitored by periodic disassembly and inspection of the arcjet motor internal surfaces. During actual operational testing, a spectrograph with an imaged-intensified diode array detector will be used to measure the emission spectra from the rocket motor exhaust plume. To monitor the effect of the appearance of soot, the exhaust plume emission spectrum will be studied to determine any spectral changes due to black body emission from soot.",

        "abstract": "The occurrence of arterial dissection associated with percutaneous excimer laser coronary angioplasty (PELCA) is a significant technical consideration that may limit medical applications. By developing a system of sequential fiber activation for fiber optic catheters, in which only a portion of the fiber optics carry energy at any one time, arterial dissection may be reduced by obtaining the same biological effects from less energy per laser pulse. This process is referred to as multiplexing. The long-term objectives are to modify our existing commercial laser (already in use for PELCA), develop the processes to manufacture catheters for multiplexing, and conduct animal and clinical trials to validate results of Phase I in vitro testing. The primary basis for technical innovation is in reducing acute complications of PELCA. This should allow more aggressive artery debulking, produce a larger lumen, attack even more difficult lesions, and allow an expansion of indications into areas currently limited by the complication rate. Once acute success is improved and larger lumens are created, we may see reductions in the restenosis rate. Reduction in ablation trauma may also make this laser a better clinical tool in other medical applica- tions such as ophthalmology, otolaryngology and orthopedics.",

The innovative choice of this system is based on the fact that it is relatively easy to grow. The GaInAs/InP system is widely used for fabricating 1.3 um and 1.55 um LEDs, lasers and detectors for tele-communication applications. The addition of an InAs strained layer is easily achieved, provides the device designer with great design freedom and leads to a structure which emits radiaiton in the 2-3 um spectral region at 300K. The only other III-V compound semiconductor material capable of emitting in the 2-3 um spectral region at 300K is the complez quaternary Sb-contraining GaInAsSb/AlGaAsSb/GaSb system, and because it is nto commonly used, miscibility gaps make it difficult to grow and requires GaSb substrates; these are not widely available and have a low melting temperature. In Phase I the optimum strained GaInAs/InP system will be identified. The in Phase II, actual growth of the InAs/GaInAs/InP epitaxial structures by the widely-used MOCVD technology will be carried out. Strained quantum well lasers will then be fabricated in a variety of 1, 2, and 3-dimensional confinement configurations. Such multi-dimensional confinement structures in these long-wavelength materials are expected ot exhibit improved 300K device characteristics because of reduced Auger recombination effects.",

Of particular interest to future Air Force efforts are electrically tuned multi-element spectral filters, which can be utilized in spectral imaging and automated target recognition (ATR) systems. Other applications for this technology would be optical interconnects, computing, communications, and logic circuits. We propose to prepare a tunable Fabry-Perot spectral filter using MOCVD crystal growth. An advanced InAlAs/InGaAs multi-quantum-well structure will be developed which will exhibit the lateral electric-field-induced refraction (LEFIR) effect, leading to a tunable filter. The lightwave propagates transverse to a stack of layers, while the electric field, applied in the lateral direction, induces changes in the refractive index of the active region containing the quantum wells. The index change results from the removal of a two-dimensional electron gas, which is supplied by planar doping. Configured as a Fabry-Perot interferometer using two stacks of Bragg mirrors, the transmissive modes are shifted in wavelength when the effective refractive index of the active region is altered by the applied field, creating the filter. In Phase II, the work will be expanded to create fully operational two dimensional arrays of these tunable optical filters.",

With a bandgap of approximately 1.85 eV, lattice-matched, ordered Ga1-xInxP (x = 0.49) is useful as an NLO material with light from GaAs-based lasers. Although most III-V alloys have been found to show ordering effects under certain growth conditions, it is well known that MOCVD-grown Ga1-xInxP displays very strong ordering of the Ga- and In-sublattices along (111)-type directions, and that the degree of ordering is controlled by growth parameters; strong ordering should lead to the large birefringence needed for NLO applications. A film grown on a (100) GaAs substrate will have the optical (\"C\") axis of the material at an angle of 54.7 degrees to the wafer surface, thus enabling tuning of an NLO system by simple rotation of the Ga1-xInxP film with respect to the incoming laser. Phase I will detemine deposition parameters which yield the greatest degree of ordering, and the strongest nonlinear optical effect. Measurements will include atomic ordering and birefringence versus growth conditions. Phase II will optimize the growth of Ga1-xInxP so that the second-order nonlinear-optical susceptibility and birefringence are maximized. We will then design, fabricate, and test a GaAs-Ga1-xInxP device which utilizes the NLO properties, such as an optical parametric oscillatoar. Development may be extended to (A1yGa1-y) 0.5In0.5P to increase the bandgap.",

Heavy elements from insulator erosion can produce serious radiation losses from high temperature plasmas. An adherent coating which is resistant to energetic particles, photons, and heat, and which has low atomic number and sputtering yield, would improve insulator performance and minimize radiation losses. Diamond and diamond-like films, applied by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes, appear to have considerable potential for coating insulators in plasma devices. Spire proposes to investigate the properties of very fine-graned polycrystalline diamond and diamond- like films on polymer and ceramic insulators. Samples will be coated and exposed to a simulated plasma environment in a modified flashover testing facility. The coatings will be evaluated from real-time diagnostic data and post-test analysis of adhesion, microscopic damage, weight loss, and composition of erosion products. Phase I research should lead to Phase II, in which insulator structures from plasma devices, such as Phillips Laboratory's Working Fluid Experiment or MARAUDER compact toroid experiment, are coated with diamond and/or diamond-like carbon and evaluated under actual operating conditions.",

THE KEY TO THE VISIBLE EMISSION IS BELIEVED TO BE THE QUANTUM CONFINEMENT PHENOMENON IN THE NANOMETER-SIZED SI CRYSTALLITES IN THE POROUS SI LAYES. AS CRYSTALLITES GET SMALLER, THE EMISSION SPECTRUM SHIFTS TO SHORTER WAVELENGTHS (BLUE SHIFT). HOWEVER, SPIRE CORPORATION HS NOTED THAT SI CRYSTALLITES WITH LIGHT EMISSION BELOW YELLOW WAVELENGTHS ARE PHYSICALLY TOO FRAGILE AND SUSCEPTIBLE TO ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS AND THUS ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR DEVICE FABRICATION. THEY ARE NOW RESEARCHING A UNIQUE SOLUTION TO THE ABOVE PROBLEM; SINCE CRYSTALLINE CARBON (DIAMOND) HAS A LARGE BANDGAP OF 5.47 EV, ALLOYS OF ONLY A FEW PERCENT C IN SI WILL READILY INCREASE THE BASE BANDGAP OF THE NEW MATERIAL INTO THE RANGE WHERE QUANTUM STRUCTURES OF STABLE DIMENSIONALITY CAN BE PREPARED.

THESE LAYES ARE THEN ELECTROCHEMICALLY-ETCHED TO PRODUCE POROUS LAYES CAPABLE OF LIGHT EMISSION IN THE BLUE WAVELENGTH RANGE. THE MATERIAL AND STRUCTURAL QUALITY OF THE EPITAXIAL AND POROUS LAYES WILL BE EVALUATED USING VARIOUS CHARACTERIZATION TECHNIQUES.

It will detect, with 100 percent efficiency, the characteristic X-rays produced by standard molybdenum targets, and will do so with very high resolution, about 60 microns (roughly half the diameter of a human hair). In Phase I, Spire will use conventional microelectronic manufacturing equipment to fabricate a small GMD, approximately 10 cm by 10 cm, and test its resolution at Texas A&M University; through its work on a GMD- based detector for the Superconducting Supercollider, Texas A&M has the background and experience to quickly and effectively evaluate Spire's design.

The labile nature of RNA extracts makes reproducible, robust RNA extraction for analysis even more difficult. We propose to apply affinity based hybrid collection techniques developed in house for PCR product detection and quantitation to the problem of sample preparation for PCR in a screening assay.

Multiple strains of HHV-6 have been detected and categorized into two proposed groups. Unequivocal evidence is needed that HHV-6 is actually two or more closely related viruses, that each type is associated with different diseases, and that both types of HHV-6 can establish a latent infection in humans. The goal of the research is to develop reagents for assessing various HHV-6 strains in clinical samples. We have recently developed a novel, high-throughput assay for distinguishing between different strains of virus by a single base pair resolution method. We propose to apply this assay to samples of HHV-6 amplified from clinical samples by use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Products will be detected with chemiluminescent probes, which are as sensitive as p32-labelled probes and more sensitive than fluorescent ones. In Phase I, we plan to adapt these methods to a rapid, economical assay for screening the two major strains of HHV-6 in clinical samples.

Because of the metallic nature of this device, the electromagnetic fields are perturbed and lead to inaccurate measurements. In addition, since this is a D-dot (theta-D/theta-t) sensor, the sensor output must be integrated to obtain the electric field. these problems of the asymptotic conical dipole could be overcome by using photonic sensors fabricated using integrated and fiber optic technologies. The photonic sensor is fabricated from an electro-optic, dielectric crystal material such as lithium niobate (LiNbO3). The sensor head and the input and output fibers offer very minimal perturbation to the electromagnetic fields. This is a passive device that does not require any power supply to the sensor head. We propose the development and laboratory demonstration of miniature electric field sensor devices that can operate from DC to 10 GHz with a dynamic range of 56 dB. The sensor devices will be fabricated with input and output optical fibers for testing and evaluation.

        "abstract": "The proposal describes an innovative R & D program to improve solderability of electronic components by controlling the formation, growth and oxidation of Cu-Sn intermetallic compounds (IMC). The rate and extent of IMC growth depends, among other factors, on the microstructure of the finish plate on the Cu substrate. Differences in microstructure such as porosity, grain boundaries, fissures, delamination and other defects, provide variable paths for solidstate diffusion of Sn and oxidants to Cu substrate. These results in different rates of solderability degradation on aging. Three different types of plating and thickness will be used to produce different types of microstructures. These will include (1) Electroplate at 3 levels of current densities to get 1,3,and 6um thickness. (2) Hot tin dip coating using 3 different coating cycles to produce 1,3,and 6um finish. (3) Solder reflow of electroplated samples. Finish thickness and composition will be measured by XRF and microsection. Solderability at various stages of aging will be measured quantitatively by SERA. \"Dip and Look\" and wetting balance methods will be used as required. Accelerated aging will be accomplished by (1) Steam aging below 95 degrees C. (2) Controlled heating in inert atmosphere. (3) Anodic oxidation of samples in SERA apparatus. Microstructure will be determined using optical microscopy as well as modern surface science techniques (SEM, TEM, AUGER/ESCA) as needed. This part will be performed at the Center for Materials Characterization, University of North Texas, Denton, Texas.",

        "abstract": "Many studies in the pharmaceutical sciences attempt to assess the effect of factors such as treatment in clinical trials on a categorical outcome variable such as the amount of improvement. Often the outcome categories have a known ordering (e. g., none, some, moderate improvement). Under this general setting, recent developments with association models (Goodman, 1991) suggest that new maximum likelihood methods may offer substantial improvements in power and flexibility over traditional approaches. In Phase I, we will develop a prototype for a new MS/Windons-based computer software package for the analysis of a 2-way table (TREATMENT by OUTCOME) by association models, where OUTCOME is an ordered categorical variable. The software will contain a unique graphical interface to make it especially east to use. By re-analyzing several clinical trial data sets which have been analyzed by traditional methods, we will also demonstrate the feasibility and value of applying association models to assess treatment effects. In Phase II, we will extend the software package to more general association models to include covariates/stratifications such as center (for multi-center studies), baseline measures and demo- graphics such as age, sex and other risk factors.",

We have recently developed experimental protocols for a psoralen based photochemical decontamination process for platelet concentrates, utilizing UVA light (320-400 nm). However, since red cells are opaque to wavelengths below 590 nm, we seek to develop a new system to inactivate pathogens in packed red cells, which can readily be implemented at the blood bank level. We seek to identify commercially available compounds which might be useful for photoinactivation of pathogens in packed red cells. This objective will be achieved through these specific aims: 1) selection of candidate compounds, which are preferentially FDA approved, and that a) are commercially available, b) interact with DNA or RNA, and c) absorb light between 590 and 750 nm.; 2) evaluation of the inactivation potential of each compound using a safe and rapid bacteriophage assay. Successful compounds, active in the bacteriophage assay, will be further evaluated for their ability to inactivate HIV-1.",

The RAP-PCR technology uses arbitrary primers to direct first strand synthesis and amplification during the PCR and provides a unique tool to identify breast tumor- specific transcripts which have heretofore gone undescribed. By comparing gene expression with normal cells, we will identify genes which are preferentially expressed in breast tumor cells, particularly those which are unregulated as a result of hormonal stimulation. The first aim is to use RAP-PCR to identify tumor specific transcripts. Sequences from these transcripts will be used in developing specific primers for use in standard reverse-transcriptase-mediated polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In Phase II, we will use the specific primers to evaluate gene expression in actual breast tumor samples, placing particular emphasis on infiltrating ductal carcinomas. The primers developed in this grant will provide pathologists with a concise molecular method which can be used for determining the appropriateness of adjuvant therapy.",

In developing these primers, we will utilize a technological approach that could be used to derive PCR primers for other pathogens associated with opportunistic infections. In the first and second aims of this project, we will use two distinct, but complementary, technologies to develop mycoplasma-specific primers. In the first aim, we will utilize a variation of PCR, called intergeneic length polymorphism PCR (ILP-PCR), to obtain fingerprints of the t-RNA gene complex present in mycoplasma. In the second aim, we will initially use a PCR-based amplification system, coupled with restriction digestion, to obtain diagnostic restriction-length fragment polymorphisms (RFLPs); this procedure has been called mapped restriction endonuclease site polymorphisms (MRSP). The diagnostic PCR bands obtained in both methods will be sequenced in order to design highly specific PCR primers.

The system will utilize the yeast FLP recombination system in vivo to clone PCR product into a recombinase target site located in a chromosomally integrated, rescuable plasmid vector. Subsequent generations of the target vector will include features which allow analysis and expression in eukaryotic systems (e. g. tissue culture cells, baculovirus expression vectors, yeast YAC vectors), facilitate large scale genome mapping when used in specialized prokaryotic cloning systems such as P1 and cosmid vectors, and allow high level expression and purification of the desired product. Application for cDNA library construction will also be explored. In light of the widespread use of PCR, and the relative inconsistency involved with cloning PCR products by conventional means, there is a broad general application for an efficient one-step PCR cloning system. The current \"state of the art\" systems all require enzymatic and purification steps following PCR. Prior to transformation, FLP-mediated PCR cloning will offer a decided advantage in that no in vitro manipulation is needed beyond the PCR reaction.",

The availability of a vector that can display a single fusion protein will have an advantage over the current M13-phage based vectors. The new vector may ultimately lead to the development of an in vitro system for studying high and low affinity antibodies. We will address a reported weakness in the existing Ml3 fusion display vectors, in which fusions are made with the gene III protein (5 copies per viral particle) or gene VIII product (2700 copies per phage particle). Because of the multiple copies of these fusion proteins, phage with low affinity epitopes are generally isolated, instead of the presumably more rare high affinity epitopes. We will use the Bacillus subtilis phage phi29 instead of M13. Peptide and protein fusions will be made with the gp3 protein, which is covalently bound to each 5' end of mature phage double-stranded DNA and is required for phage replication. The DNA will be isolated from phage particles or cell lysates and cut with an appropriate restriction endonuclease to remove one end, but retaining the end containing the protein-gp3 fusion protein and the gene encoding it (in the Phase II form). This system, in which DNA has an attached monovalent protein probe, can be used for construction of peptide libraries and for generation of antibody-gp3 fusions.",

Surface-mounted sensors may allow measurement of the growth, spatial distribution and frequency content of instability waves in hypersonic boundary layers. Such measuremenmts are required in the short term to aid in airfoil design and testing, and in the long term as part of active control surface instrumentation. Fiber and Sensor Technologies (F&S) proposes to investigate the feasibility of novel types of surface-mounted optical fiber sensors for the measurement of hypersonic boundary layer instability modes. Such sensors, based in part on fiber strain gage concepts commercialized by F&S, have been demonstrated by F&S and their subcontractor, the Fiber & Electro-Optics Research Center at Virginia Tech, for detection of stress wave displacement fields on and in metals, ceramics and composites.

        "abstract": "Biofilms that form on metallic surfaces can exert a significant influence on corrosion of shipboard seawater piping and heat exchangers. Early detection of biofilm formation permits the system operator to implement mitigation measures when they are most effective. A novel electrochemical sensor has been developed for on-line monitoring of biological activity and biocorrosion. The two-electrode probe utilizes a stack of identical stainless steel electrodes that are polarized relative to one another for a short time each day. This probe has demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting biofilm formation in fresh water environments. Biofilm activity is signalled by an increase in the current required to achieve the pre-set polarization potential and by the appearance of a low-level current between the electrodes, even when the applied potential is removed. This probe configuraiton also permits biofilm detection by monitoring changes in the ohmic resistance along probe surfaces. The proposed concept has been shown to be effective in signalling the formation of biofilm, te precursor to microbiologically influenced corrosion, in scale-forming and scale-dissolving fresh water environments. During Phase I, the feasibility of adapting this approach for detecting biofilm formation and microbiologically influenced corrosion in seawater will be demonstrated.",

In addition to developing the patch, initial work on the proper repair procedures for these canopies with this new light cured patch will be performed.

A high quality, HTS / low e dielectric / HTS layer structure is the enabling technology for many different applications including multi-chip modules, interconnects and high frequency microwaves. HTS interconnects offer significant reductions in rise time caused by RC time constant effects; however, the lowest possible effective dielectric constant is necessary to minimize the signal delay time. Inter-layer shorts and the high dielectric constant of possible materials for epitaxial growth has hindered the building of tri-layers. Tri-layers have been demonstrated on small area (1cm2), but invariably have problems with outgrowths and boulders puncturing the dielectric layer unless a planarization step is used. The focus for the work in Phase I of this program is to investigate laminating superconductor layers with intermediate organic polymers.

        "abstract": "The application of advanced barrel coatings to provide extended erosion and wear life with high performance ammunition for existing and proposed weapons systems has been limited by the available process technologies capable of applying the required/desired coatings. Electroplating, Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD), and Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) have all been attempted with varying degrees of success. Desired coating materials are best applied using PVD, however PVD has suffered from geometric constraints due to a line-of-sight requirement from target to substrate. SURFACE SOLUTIONS (SSI) has developed a new form of PVD deposition, DC Linear Magnetron Sputtering (LMS), capable of uniform deposition inside a gun barrel with a length to diameter ratio exceeding 100 : 1. SSI believes that LMS will be capable of uniformly depositing high-temperature, corrosion resistant materials such as tantalum, alloys of tantalum, molybdenum, niobium, etc. LMS is a line-of-sight PVD process whereby the target(coating material) is tubular and is aligned coazially with the substrate (gun barrel). Sputtering occurs radially and uniformly down the entire lingth of the target and requires no external magnets to contain the plasma. The required uniform magnetic field is generated electrically and is the basis of SSI's LMS process.",

        "abstract": "An electrolyte reformation technique for use in the aluminum-silver oxide battery system is proposed. Successful implementation of this technique will reduce the weight of the energy section of a high power aluminum-silver oxide battery by more than 100 pounds. The technique is based on the fact that while sodium aluminate is soluble in hot aqueous solutions of sodium hydroxide, lithium aluminate is not. Therefore, the addition of lithium hydroxide to a sodium hydroxide solution, containing dissolved sodium aluminate, will cause a reaction in which lithium aluminate forms as a precipitate with the reformation of sodium hydroxide. The weight savings are the result of not throwing over board contaminated electrolyte but instead reclaiming the electrolyte using the proposed electrolyte reformation technique. Carrying the majority of the electrolyte in the lower molecular weight form, lithium hydroxide, provides additional weight reduction. Sixty four laboratory experiments will establish the operating parameters of the technique. A 1/16 scale electrolyte circulation and reformation test apparatus oprating at 10 gallons per minute will be designed, fabricated and tested to demonstrate the efficacy of the technique.

        "abstract": "Aerodynamic flow about flight vehichles with an onboard optical sensor often contributes to image degradation of the optical signal received by the sensor. This phenomenon is called aero-optic degradation, and is caused by the wavefront distortion optical radiation suffers upon transmission through the aerodynamic environment. This aero-optic degradation occurs on a continuous spatial and temporal basis, and can be quite severe, especially when the aerodynamic environment is highly turbulent. Progress in the design of reliable flight optical sensors requires an ability to accurately determine the impact aerodynamic flow environments have on propagating optical radiation. This proposal presents an innovative instrument to directly measure the aero-optically distorted wavefront at high speed and high resolution, the aerodynamic environment. The device consists of a specially designed Hartmann Waveront Sensor (HWS) adapted ot a high speed camera, which will provide phase maps of the time varying aero-optic distortions imposed on optical waves at the high temporal frequencies and small spatial resolutions required ot meet the need for an optical diagnostic tool for aerodynamic turbulence research. The adaptation of an ingenious high speed adaptive optical element provides a new opportunity to perform \"real-time\" correction to the distorted waves measured by our HWS sensor. Miniaturization of this diagnostic tool could provide the solution to optical sensing onboard flight vehicles.",

The photodetector is prepared by depositing purple membranes isolated from Halobacterium halobium onto an electrode. Purple membranes contain bacteriorhodopsin which is an integral protein that, when stimulated by light, pumps protons across the lipid bilayer of the membrane. Purple membrane-based photodetectors have a wide variety of advantages over standard electronic photodetection systems including stability (they produce the same photoelectric response to light for years), compactness, sensitivity to light, low cost and the ability to elicit a differential response (i. e., respond to changes in light intensity with a constant light background). The new photodetectors could provide advanced detection capabilities for discriminating between antibody isotypes, subgroups and immunospecificities. As commercial products, the photodetection device can be incorporated into analytical instrumentations for diagnostic monitoring of patients at bedside and in emergency situations.",

The PBSS uses a unique dynamic technique to measure patient-bed weight. The dynamic measurement technique provides a means to include self-diagnostics for the sensors and electronics. This system has the potential of improving the accuracy of measuring patient weight by as much as a factor of 50 when compared to commercial patient-bed weighting systems. The PBSS is intended for patients who are temporarily or permanently incapacitated and cannot be transferred from a bed to a scale easily, comfortably, or conveniently. Its precision, sensitivity and dynamic range will permit the early detection and treatment of fluid imbalances, accuracy, and the longer-term follow-up of nutritional problems. These applications are most relevant to the management of patients in intensive care units with their heavy, extensively instrumented beds, bed ridden on pediatric or adult hospital, rehabilitation, or extended care nursing floors, confined to special beds such as Stryker frames, undergoing inpatient and outpatient rental dialysis, or in premature nurseries. Additionally, the PBSS can be used to continuously monitor patient activity while in bed. A team consisting of a technical manager, a physician, and several design and test engineers will combine their expertise to design, construct and test a low-cost precision piezoelectric load cell, formulate a suitable design for the pneumatic lift system, and fabricate and test a prototype unit. In Phase I research, the prototype system will be tested using a commercial hospital bed. The PBSS represents a significant advancement in high capacity, high resolution, rugged patient-bed weighting systems. This system can be retrofitted to any commercial hospital bed, crib, incubator, or reclining chair without interfering with patient care or the operation of the bed.",

The human Y1 receptor, linked to various CNS disorders including anxiety, depression, bulimia, and cocaine addition, has been cloned and targeted by Synaptic Pharmaceutical Corporation for the development of orally available, centrally active, non-peptide drugs. In Phase I, we will coordinate multidisciplinary resources from molecular biology, medicinal chemistry, molecular modeling, and pharmacology. To start, we will channel the Y1 receptor, currently studied in transient expression systems, into a stably transformed cell line optimal for functional analysis of NPY-like agonists and antagonists. Simultaneously, we will exploit a chemical screening strategy based on prior examination of non-peptide compounds with gross structural similarity to NPY and also to benextramine, an NPY-like adrenergic drug. This strategy has resulted in the identification of several structural leads with affinity for NPY receptors. These compounds will now be modified and re-evaluated in more extensive pharmacological assays based on radioligand competition and functional coupling to adenylate cyclase activity. Long term goals will be realized in Phase II when compounds will be tested in increasingly relevant bioassays for anxiety, feeding, and other CNS disorders.",

The cloning of two novel GABA transporters, in addition to the previously cloned neuronal transporter, suggests a diversity of therapeutic targets. However, it is not known whether an effective drug should be a substrate for the transporter or should simply bind, but not be transported. Due to the electrogenic properties of these transporters, transport of substrate is associated with membrane depolarization. Measurements of membrane voltage during transport allow one to distinguish between substrate and non-substrate inhibitors. We will establish a fluorescent assay for transport. We will utilize voltage-sensitive dyes by using the neuronal transporter designated GAT-1. This methodology will allow a rapid screening assay for newly synthesized drugs, and it will provide information as to their mechanism of action. In Phase II, we will extend these studies to the two novel transporters and test selective compounds in animal models of epilepsy.",

Data suggesting the applicability of this material to a wide range of species and tissue types including human products of conception are presented. We will determine if the use of CeReS to increase the number and quality of metaphase spreads is feasible. SynchroCell, the exclusive licensee of CeReS, believes that the use of this molecule may increase speed and reduce cost of routine karyotypic analysis. In addition, prometaphase spreads providing detailed banding may be more readily obtained. Further sample types that previously exhibited too low a mitotic index may become amenable to routine analysis.

        "abstract": "In current and developing air combat systems, issues of operational flexibility and reliability have gained substantial interest. It would be desirable for one aircraft's fire control system to be able to take advantage of sensor data from other platforms, for several reasons. First, this would give each aircraft access to sensors that it may not mount; for example, long-range search sensors or intelligence sources. Second, it would give each aircraft access to similar sensors that are differently located, and can see different targets; for example, on other aircraft in the same flight. Third, it might give an aircraft a means to carry out its mission, even when some of it sensors have failed. SYNETICS approach to solving this problem, the Multi-Aircraft Networked Tracking Architecture (MANTA), is based on recent advances in statistical filter theory that have been used successfully in other Air Force programs. The tracking filters on each aircraft accept both own-ship sensor data, at sensor (high) rates, and \"summarized\" other-ship data obtained through the communications channel (e.g. JTIDS) at relatively low rates.",

Unlike conventional avionics and flight control displays comprised of electromechanical gauges and dials that hold their final readings at the time of a crash, glass cockpit flight instrumentation loses all data upon a crash and provides no clues to aid the post-crash investigation. SYNETICS proposes to demonstrate the use of the new Hewlett Packard KittyHawk Personal Storage Module (a miniature rugged hard disk) properly interfaced to the video RAM of an electronic display to achieve an Instant Flight Replay capability. The primary role of the flight-recorder (black box) mounted KittyHawk Instant Flight Replay system would be post-crash flight analysis; however, with somewhat different packaging, the KIFR system would support post-flight analysis of training flights. SYNETICS proposal is especially innovative and beneficial to the Air Force for three reasons: (1) SYNETICS proposes a joint effort with Rockwell International (at no cost for Rockwell's consultation during Phase I), (2) Phase I will not be limited to a theoretical analysis of feasibility, but will include the important issues of shock and temperature testing, and (3) the KIFR will be designed both for integration inside existing flight recorders and for standalone use in military aircraft having no flight recorder.",

The aims are to determine the feasibility of using CeReS to improve and increase efficiency of cell culture, to provide new models for differentiation, and to test a wide variety of cancer cell lines for sensitivity or resistance to CeReS. Preliminary data indicates differential sensitivity of cells suggesting potential therapeutic uses. We believe this and related molecules will be important products for the research community.

The cruise missile planner, with some difficulty, can determine needed candidate TERCOM sites, but all too ofter, because of insufficient terrain roughness, the Defense Mapping Agency (DMA) is unable to create a TERCOM at this location. According to DMA, as many as 90% of the TERCOM requests they receive are infeasible or repeat infeasible requests. As a result, the planner is left with unsatisfied TERCOM needs, and DMA's time is wasted. SCT has been developing an interactive graphics program for the Air Force which integrates our operationally proven cruise missile routing algorithms with DMA-endorsed TERCOM site validation criteria. This program provides a window based user interface with graphical plots, optimal path computations, data management of past and present TERCOM requests, TERCOM site validation tests, request form production, and message handling between DMA and the STRATCOM. This technology can be adapted to meet the Navy's specific TERCOM planning needs at a low cost with minimal or no risk.

The present military standard for flying qualities of piloted air vehicles, MIL-STD-1797A, is a comprehensive document that has evolved over the past several decades into a \"cookbook\" of requriements. Unfortunately, the mission requirements for current and future aircraft include many aspects that are insufficiently covered by the specification. Primary among the shortcomings are three basic categories for research: the effect of the pilot's visual environment (cueing); 2) the effect of the response to task-tailored controls (response-type); and 3) the effect of the specific mission element (task). The Phase I program will have the following two major objectives: 1) Create the structure, format, and methodology to incorporate visual cueing, response-types, and modern tasks into a mission-oriented specification format; and 2) Generate the basic tables relating these elements in an integrated fashion.

        "abstract": "An original approach to application of active control in fighter maneuvering is proposed. This will involve a problem-driven design process tailored to exploit new developments in robust multivariable control theory to serve the needs of real world flight control design. This process emphasizes the formulation of application-specific design requirements as the key to practical implementation of new multivariable synthesis methodologies. Requirements formulation includes the development of new multivariable lower order equivalent systems (MLOES) models for representation of basic requirements and their interface with various multivariable synthesis procedures. These will be used in a process involving directed optimization in which the overall flight control system will be developed as a related suite of multi-loop designs distinguished and integrated by functional modality.",

        "abstract": "For the military helicopter in combat, the loss of a control surface under any circumstance usually translates into either an emergency landing or complete loss of control. A critical factor in determining the pilot's chance of maintaining control is the level of redundancy in control effectors, or more correctly, the lack of such redundancy. Unlike fixed-wing aircraft, the control effectors on the conventional helicopter are integrated, so that, in the event of a failure, the pilot's task of determining the proper control strategies and continuing to a safe landing is extremely difficult. There is a potential for assisting the pilot on future designs by implementing reconfigurable flight control system (RFCS) algorithms. Such approaches are showing promise for fixed-wing aircraft; their application to helicpoters, however, requires a recognition of the distinct differences between fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft controls and responses. This proposal presents an approach to the subject starting with demonstrating the feasibility of producing a controllable impaired aircraft. If funded, the Phase I work will examine all possible failures for a current helicopter, focusig on one example critical failure. For this failure the feasible flight control laws to provide Level 3 (or better) flying qualities will be dveloped.",

        "abstract": "SYSTRAN proposes to formulate (in Phase I) the top-level design of a Meta System application to support users of the Avionics Wind Tunnel (AWT). The AWT is a vision, shared by members of the Avionics Directorate, Flight Dynamics Directorate, and other Wright Laboratory and Area-B facilities, for a real-time R&D facility that will utilize the most appropriate facility subsystems to accommodate the technology needs of internal and external simulation, experimentation, test, and demonstration users. Some of the facilities that will compose AWT assets include the Avionics Directoate's Integrated Test Bed (ITB), the Integrated Electromagetic System Simulator (IESS), the Communications Systems Engineerig Laboratory (CSEL), the Integrated Defensive Avionics Laboratory (IDAL), the Radar/Fire Control Lab and the Flight Dynamics Directorate's assortment of flight simulators. These assets include a mixture of digital simulation models, hardware-in-the-loop subsystems, and pilot-in-the-loop (PITL) simulators and stations. Currently, plans are being implemented to relocate some existing Avionics Directorate facilities (which are not located in Bldg 620) to Bldg 620 as part of a three-phase military construction program. The ground-breaking for the initial phase of this construciton is slated to start in early CY93. SYSTRAN believes a major void to the successful and efficient implementation and operation of the AWT is that of a software system that will support AWT users in the selection, composition, and application of the individual hardware and software \"components\" (i.e., subsystems, modules, packages, processors, etc.) into a AWT instantiation that most appropriately fits the needs of an AWT customer. SYSTRAN proposes, in Phase I, to specify and design a (top-level) Meta-System Application to fill this AWT void. In Phase II this Meta-System Application would be developed and demonstrated.",

For the routing operation of the above system, the re-calibration is not required and the system maintenance is minimum.

        "abstract": "Isolation systems are used on spacecraft to reduce structural loadings from shock and vibration during launch. The launch environment includes both step-like acceleration and random vibration as a combined input. This requires a cumbersome high displacement isolation system when conventional passive spring and damping elements are used. Prior research using active isolation with force drivers has predicted improved performance, but high power requirements and the need for complex sensor systems presents a substantial problem for spacecraft use. This proposal describes an improved isolation system, using semi-active controls, where essentially passive spring and damping elements have their output parameters varied by the control system. This semi-active isolator is both simple and reliable, requiring a minimum of sensors for excellent performance. The design is also inherently fail safe, reverting to passive operation as a redundant operating mode. Computer simulation results are provided, comparing the semi-active isolator with comparable active and passive types. The simulation demonstrates the superiority of the semi-active device. The simulation code is PC based, and is capable of studying all known launch environments, and can be used to select isolator parameters for present and future isolation applications.",

These thick-film layers will have the capacity to provide practical cooling in the presence of significant heat loads. TE Technology, Inc. will draw on its experience and success on previous SBIR programs using the wide range of TE material compositions developed under its Navy SBIR program. Forty different N and P-type films will be designed, fabricated and tested to establish the feasibility ofthe plasma-spray, thick-film technology.

        "abstract": "Non-nutritive food additives and antibiotics are entering the food chain in ever increasing amounts. Consequently, there is increased public health concerns over the effects these compounds may have on the human intestinal microflora. Shifts in populations of intestinal bacteria can result in colonic disorders such diarrhea, flatulence and decreased resistance to intestinal pathogens. Whereas there are several ways to monitor the effects of food additives on the flora's metabolic activity, there is still no feasible way to screen for changes in bacterial populations. Classical taxonomic techniques involve costly culturing which cannot be adapted to large numbers of samples. However, analysis of cellular fatty acids (CFAs) by gas chromatography, which is used to rapidly identify bacteria, can now be adapted using new statistical methods to determine the relatedness among bacterial populations. The studies herein will determine the feasibility of using CFA analysis to establish \"fingerprints\" for bacterial popula- tions in rodents and to resolve shifts in bacterial populations upon dietary intervention. As a rapid, and highly resolving technique, CFA fingerprinting of intestinal contents could become a preferred means by which food or pharmaceutical companies may monitor the effects of compounds in feeding trials during product development.",

        "abstract": "Feeding rats a semipurified diet containing casein as a protein source results in severe gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity when the chemotherapeutic drug methotrexate (MTX) is given. However, when soy concentrate protein is used in place of casein, rats are completely protected from toxicity. The purpose is to determine if soy concentrate protein is protective against cyclophosphamide (CY) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) toxicity in rats. 5-fluorouracil is a chemotherapeutic drug that causes severe side effects to the GI tract because of its effect on cell division. If soy concentrate proves to be protective in toxicity associated with chemotherapy, it could easily be incorporated into an enteral product and be tested in cancer patients to boost their nutrient intake. This soy product would help to maintain patients' adequate nutrition and, therefore, their nutritional status which has been shown to increase tolerance to chemotherapy. Further, if toxic side effects were minimized, it may be possible to increase doses of drugs and more effectively kill tumor cells.",

Its development, by design, will provide for integration into th open architecture environment of the workcell and the factory floor, and in addition provide for the integration of its internal components into open architecture systems. The technological advances proposed within draw upon lessons learned from previous NGC programs such as MOSAIC, and also from Army initiatives in distributed intelligent controls for Army programs such as intelligent minefields and advanced field artillery systems, and DoD programs in robotic system simulation and control. A demonstration of the NGC concepts is proposed, through the integration of a vision-based sensor and data base manager with a water-jet milling machine provided by Pratt & Whitney.",

Other agencies, such as the US Army Engineering Topographical Laboratory, provide terrain data products as well. DMA currently provides Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) and Interim Terrain Data (ITD) as the high resolution terrain data products usable by maneuver forces. Also emerging, but in very limited data sets, is the follow on to ITD called the Tactical Terrain Database (TTD). The generation of terrain data for plan-view and perspective-view display from the DMA data will vary in complexity depending upon the display requirements, including resolution; the source and resolution of the data; and the icons/symbols added to the display to meet a military planning, control, or training objective. US Army TACOM, in developing Soldier-Machine Interfaces (SMI), has developed the Vetronics Crew Display Demonstrator (VCDD) to display data to the surrogate crew member and evaluate data presentation requirements, data presentation efficiency (human factors), and control mechanisms. The VCDD requires new and additional terrain data for meaningful evaluation of SMI, which is the purpose of this proposal.",

The process has been demostrated manually and has been shown through design of equipment to be feasible for an automated system. The process offers several attributes which are not, in combination, available with any other process. Cross rib-stiffened preforms have been woven by Techniweave, Inc. using carbon fibers with the ribs integrally woven with the panel(skin). Quasi-isotropic fiber orientation was used in both the panel and ribs which can be varied to suit the designers requirements. Z-direction reinforcement was introduced without damage to fibers. Similar methods can be used to fabricate other ceramic fiber preforms. Techniweave proposes to demostrate the innovative concept through the fabrication of carbon fiber preforms that will be densified with a carbonaceous matrix by B.F.Goodrich Super-Temp. The quality of the composite will be evaluated through preliminary mechanical properties and compared to the state of the art in carbon-carbon composites. Further consideration will be given to the design and feasibility of automated equipment that can handle brittle fibers such as carbon and other ceramic fibers. A recommendation will be made with respect to a Phase II program.",

Pairs of slightly defocussed images are processed at millisecond rates for amplitude as well as the usual phase information. Through the energy transport-equation technique and through feedback of correction for speckle, clear images are real-time, digitally reconstructed without the deformable mirror of conventional adaptive optics.

Real-time tests require 5-15 years, and results often apply only to obsolete technology. Accelerated life testing (ALT) is a means by which reliability data may be obtained quickly and at a reasonable cost. A primary difficulty with ALT of ECS units is that typical service conditions impose multiple stresses on the hardware. Each stress must be accurately modeled in order to correlate normal aging with accelerated again at balanced so that the aging rates are equal for all induced stresses. ECS operating profiles will be characterized for different geographic areas, and these data will be used to design a complete, multiple stress, multiple accleration factor ALT. Included in the ALT design will be test apparatus diagrams, methods for accelerating normal aging rates using elevated stress levels, monitoring methods for the collection of relevant data, and statistical analysis technicques for producing reliability estimates from the ALT data. Initial aging investigations will be made using ON/OFF duty cycle acceleration for small air-conditioning units.",

The thin film resonator technology offers significant size reductions and high performance compared to ceramic or other conventional frequecny control technologies. The Phase I tasks will demonstrate a high performance narrow band filter for use in fuzing and GPS telemetry application and design a low power oscillator using high performance microwave acoustic resonators to control oscillator frequency.

        "abstract": "The lack of Multilevel Secure (MLS) computer systems within the Department of Defense (DOD) is recognized as a significant shortcoming. Past efforts to build secure computing environments have resulted in a multiplicity of single-level systems, operating on a system high mode, with each system handling a single level of classified information. This results, in addition to difficulties and inefficiencies in intercommunication, in significant data redundancy, overclassification, time delays, and the added expense of maintenance and operational costs associated with redundant equipment. There have been several recent efforts to develop workable distributed computing environments. None of these have made serious inroads into addressing multilevel security. Part of the lack of progress is attributable to our lack of understanding of the impact of security as applied to a true distributed computing environment. The objective of this effort is to identify and analyze the functional capabilities required by a distributed computing environment capable of supporting heterogeneous processors performing real-time operations. The security threats to a distributed system will also be identified and analyzed. In addition, several existing distributed operating environments will be analyzed as possible candidates for designing a trusted distributed computing environment. Finally, some initial requirements for the design of a trusted distributed operating system will be developed.",

Although more energetic fuels have been shown to exist through projects such as the Air Force High Energy Density Materials Program, these fuels are unstable enough to not yet be practical. It has been proposed to add these energetic materials to cryogenic solid molecular hydrogen to form a stable, superior-performance fuel. Solid cryogenic propellants may even emerge as an important part of what the American Space Exploration Initiative has recently recognized as the critical national technology of cryogenics. Based on the technology of pellet fueling of fusion plasmas, this proposal first describes the design of a prototype solid hydrogen propellant system for combustion studies. The hydrogen is condensed directly into a solid, extruded, formed into pellets, and injected into a combustion chamber. The primary remaining feasibility issues of such a system: pellet interaction with combustion, rapid solid condensation from a gas, and the development of a high feed rate injector, will also be addressed. The proposed work is expected to provide basis for a practical solid hydrogen rocket propulsion system.",

To maximize the energy density of a high energy density polymer capacitor, not only must the constituent polymer material properties be optimized, but the best capacitor fabrication/production techniques must be employed. Adhesion of vapor deposited aluminum as well as the breakdown voltages of a number of polymer films have been markedly increased after these polymer films have been briefly exposed to various low pressure, low temperature gas plasmas. Initial evaluations on prototypes, spirally wound polymer capacitors (capacitor was briefly exposed to a 96% CF4/4% 02 gas plasma) have shown that breakdown voltage can be increased by a factor of 2-4. Why does plasma processing significantly improve breakdown strength, and what are the optimum plasma processing conditions that produce these improvements without causing any undersirable effects on other bulk properties of the capacitor polymer? TPL will develop and demonstrate various spirally wound, capacitors based on specific ETDL inventions/patents which have already been prototyped and successfully demonstrated. Selected polymer films and capacitors will be fabricated and subjected to plasma treatments to identify both the optimum processing conditions and the fundamental basis for the dielectric breakdown improvements.

Ex situ remediation of some metal contaminated sites has been demonstrated on a small scale using specially adapted microbes, but removal of the contaminated soil and slow turnover rates downgrades this method. Hyperaccumulator plants show great potential, but only a very few, rare species have been identified as hyperaccumulators. Bacteria will be adapted to high lead concentrations through soil-extract culture methods. These adapted will increase the transport of lead from soil to plants. These adapted bacteria have the potential to generate hyperaccumulation of lead in common crop plants, such as Grasses, Legumes, and Brassica. These crop plants, because of these advantages of wide geographic distribution, fast growth, multiple cuttings, commercially available seed, genetic variability, and known agronomics, could significantly enhance hyperaccumulation as a site remediation technique. TPL will evaluate the contaminated lead sites, hyperaccumulators and remediation techniques to choose potential candidates. Bacterial and chemical enhancement methods for bacteria adaptation will be studied. A final greenhouse test of lead accumulation using the candidate plants with the enhancement techniques will be performed. Dr. K.

        "abstract": "The overall goal is to develop the optimal hypertonic resuscitation formulation for pre-hospital treatment of hemorrhage and trauma. Current methods of isotonic fluid resuscitation for pre-hospital hypovolemia are often inadequate due to inability to deliver required volume. Small volume resuscitation using highly hyperosmotic/hyperoncotic formulations was developed to provide rapid hemodynamic recovery. However, hypertonic saline formulations cause acidosis, may inadequately increase oxygen delivery/consumption, and aggravate internal bleeding. This research utilizes the recent discovery of a specific Na-Cl-Acetate formulation that offers unique physiological benefits which directly address these problems. Preliminary experiments suggest that such a solution better normalizes acid-base balance and greatly augments cardiac output and oxygen delivery. Another benefit is that resuscitation with this solution results in only a modest increase in systolic blood pressure, thereby minimizing internal bleeding. The research plan is to test an Na-Cl-Acetate Dextran solution in clinically relevant animal models of controlled and uncontrolled hemorrhage. Control groups will be resuscitated with 1) the current standard-of-care isotonic lactated Ringer's, 2) hypertonic saline dextran, and 3) no resuscitation. In one series of experiments, conscious, hypovolemic sheep will be used to carefully evaluate the efficacious dose and the effects on oxygen delivery and consumption. In the other series, anesthetized pigs with uncontrolled aortic bleeding will be resuscitated to determine the effects of resuscitation on uncontrolled internal bleeding to model pre-2hospital trauma. This research may lead to significantly better resuscitation regimens that offer improved efficacy and safety compared to currently used solutions.",

Specifically, cholesteryl modified TFOs that are designed to bind to the consensus progesterone response element and the lE 175 promoter of HSV-2 will be examined in detail. Preliminary data indicate that the cellular efficacy of sequence specific TFOs are increased considerably due to the attachment of cholesterol. In the Phase l study, the emphasis will be to confirm these results and undertake a systematic investigation on the mechanism of this enhancement. In addition, uptake, stability, cellular distribution, toxicity and the aggregation properties of the TFOs in aqueous solutions will be studied. The effects of attaching cholesterol through novel linkers of various lengths as well as reversible disulfide linkages will also be examined. In Phase II, using methods that are currently being developed in our laboratory for large scale synthesis, gram quantities of these modified TFOs will be synthesized.

Triple helix formation at the promoter or within a structural gene has been shown to repress transcription, and cells growing in culture have been shown to take up single stranded oligonucleotides through the cell membrane. Further, uptake of triple helix-forming oligonucleotides directed against transfected promoter-reporter gene constructs has repressed transcription of reporter gene in cultured cells. We will use triple helix formation to repress the transcription of progesterone receptor. Since progesterone is one of a family of steroid hormones important in breast tissue growth and development, and other strategies of progesterone receptor repression have proven effective against some breast cancers, we believe this approach has potential therapeutic value against breast cancer.",

Oligonucleotides have long been known to be capable of binding to duplex DNA to form triple helix complexes. Advances in triplex technology now allows the design of triplex-forming oligonucleotides to bind with complex DNA duplex sequences under physiological conditions. Binding by triplex-forming oligonucleotides to duplex DNA has been shown to disrupt binding to that duplex by site specific DNA binding proteins and to inhibit gene expression in several systems. We intend to test the ability of triplex-forming oligonucleotides to inhibit viral gene expression and virus growth in cell culture systems. Triplex-forming oligonuceotides will be designed to disrupt specific viral transcription initiation and elongation events as well as viral DNA replication events of human cytomegalovirus. These oligonculeotides will be synthesized and analyzed for the actual binding ability to synthetic target sequences in vitro, and then they will be assayed as anti-viral agents in cell culture. Any triplex-forming oligonucleotide capable of inhibiting viral growth in cell culture assays will have passed the Phase I studies and proceed to further evaluation as an antiviral agent in an animal model system. The use of this technology for the development of antiviral agents is an innovative approach to the design of antiviral drugs.",

Specifically, the resulting material will address the drawbacks associated with competing systems such as thermal lensing, lasing efficiency, laser life, process complexity and user-friendliness and demonstrate the potentials of this unique new system by fabricating ruggedized transmissive host laser medium that will have minimal optical defects, high mechanical strength, and minimal dye-host interaction; all compared to Ormosil sol-gel-polymer media. In Phase I of this program, we will produce and characterize several candidate SupraGel host materials, several dye-host samples, and we will lase one or more of these laser dye-host materials. In Phase II, we plan to optimize the process and study the structure-property relationship of the proposed systems. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: The proposed program will develop a tunable visible light laser, without the problems of fluid flow management, potential toxicity, and potential flammability that are associated with fluid dye lasers.

We have already successfully demonstrated the feasibility of this unique process. The proposed effort will expand this technology to better understand it's processing parameters and optimize this technique in terms of mechanical, physical and thermal performance of the final composite. The result will be complex-shaped, fiber reinforced CMC's which are designed to outperform CMC's processed by alternative processes. Our approach is based on \"Resin Transfer Molding\" (RTM) of organic matrix composites (OMC) which has been in use for several decades as a lower-cost alternative to autoclave curing and other labor and capital intensive processes used in high performance applications. The main advantages of this process are it's ability to deliver near-net-shape complex shapes in high volume and low cost with good surface topography. Other advantages include flexibility in tooling and materials, easy part consolidation through molded-in parts and fittings, fast production cycles and less than 2 percent voids. The Phase I program will optimize the process conditions, fabricate and characterize several fiber reinforced CMC specimens using a \"Ceramic Transfer Molding\" technique. The Phase II program will optimize the process for maximum strength, toughness and high temperature performance.",

Low temperature phase y-Al2-O3 coatings will be prepared on aluminum alloys by sol-gel processing. The problem of drying and sintering of gels on aluminum alloys will be solved by rapid thermal processing (RTP). RTP involves high temperature (1000-1200 degrees C) exposure for a very short (5-20 sec) period of time, so that the substrate temperature may not exceed the thermal limit of processing aluminum alloys. The Phase I goal is to demonstrate the process feasibility by depositing anhydrous alumina coatings. The coatings will be characterized for chemical composition, morphology, thermodynamic stability, hydrolytic stability and bondability.",

        "abstract": "Iridium/Rhenium (Ir/Re) technology developed at Ultramet has demonstrated the ability of liquid rocket engines to operate above 2200C for tens of hours. 22-N (5-lbf) and 445-N (100-lbf) units have been built and tested, and have demonstrated an improvement in specific impulse (Isp) of some 20 seconds, which translates into a productivity increase of 5-10%. Similar results could be achieved if this technology could be transferred to large and/or new technology engines, such as electric propulsion. The key problem is weight, as the structural material, rhenium, has a density of 21 g/cm3 and 44.5-kN (10,000-lbf) engine made of solid rhenium would weigh some 200 kg, which is unacceptably high. In this Phase I program, Ultramet proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating large Ir/Re rocket engines that exhibit the same performance as the previously demonstrated small engines but with no weight penalty, through the application of bold and innovative materials science to the develpment of unique composite structures such that further advances can be made in this area of technology.",

        "abstract": "Current superalloy tururbopump rotor materials are limited in both maximum use temperature and environmental stability. Extended use at elevated temperatures leads to stress corrosion cracking, followed by turbine blade separation. Ultramet previously fabricated an iridium coating on a forged Astroloy Mk-51 turbopump turbine rotor by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Iridium was selected as the coating material for two reasons. First, its high temperature envionmental stability has been demonstrated in test-firing of iridium-lined rhenium thrust chambers at temperatures above 4000F for more than 15 hours without failure. Second, iridium can be applied by CVD at ~900F, low enough that the coating process will not affect the condition of the forging or cause dimensional changes. Even though the turbine disk had been tested previously and was severely work hardened, the iridium-coated rotor survived 10 starts totaling 4,106 seconds of hot-fire time at 60,000-65,000 rpm with only isolated areas of coating failure, which were attributed to the external work hardening of the rotor surface during fabrication by the manufacturer and/or a coating/substrate thermal expansion mismatch. In this Phase I program, Ultramet proposes to apply innovative materials and processing to turbopump protection. By expanding the materials studied to include iridium, platinum, and palladium and developing new processing techniques, success is virtually ensured. Each material offers outstanding high temperature environmental stability, with the latter two possibly providing better mechanical integrity due to a closer CTE match.",

This SRB-based starting system would replace the pyrotechnic starter cartridge currently used as a gas generator and ignition source for the sustainer engine, thereby reducing both the cost and weight of the total system without sacrificing performance. The primary difficulties involved are fivefold: reducing the 5000 R, 1500-psia SRB flame to conditions that will not damage the turbine rotor; maintaining sufficient gas velocity, pressure, and mass flow to the impingement nozzles to successfully start the engine, taking into consideration pressure losses due to gas cooling and frictional effects; demonstrating materials of construction capable of surviving th erosive, high temperature propellant gas; modifying the SRB to account for pressure and heat losses due to gas diversion; and possibly filtering carbon, alumina, and other condensible matter from the hot gas stream before its introduction into the turbine section. This program will demonstrate a workable design capable of surmounting these obstacles through theoretical calculations and hardware demonstration of a SRB-based starter system.",

Underscoring this effort are advanced signal processing algorithms based on higher-order cumulants or spectra (HOS) techniques, such as the trispectrum. HOS-based techniques have shown great promise in terms of accuracy, robustness and performance improvement over autocorrelation (or power spectrum) -based methods in the face of statistical uncertainties of communication environments. Consequently, the development and application of HOS-based algorithms to noise and interference reduction problems that arise in wideband communications has become timely. Four directions are covered during this exploratory development: (1) utilization of HOS-based Time-Frequency Distributions for the identification and cancellation of narrowband/wideband interferences; (2) development of HOS-based methods for the suppression of additive Gaussian noise (generally colored and possibly spatially correlated); (3) evaluation of the performance of the HOS-based methods against varying SNRs, SIRs, as well as different noise/interference characteristics; (4) development of a Reduced Complexity Algorithmic Architecture (RCA2) and assessment of algorithmic complexity.",

To accomplish this goal, the genes for TNF-alpha and TNF-beta will be altered as desired by use of site - directed mutagenesis. Desired traits are those predicted by computer modeling to produce proteins that retain their ability to trimerize and bind to cell surface receptors in a substantially normal fashion. In addition, these proteins will have either enhanced or diminished functional activity, as monitored in model target systems. The functional activities selected for testing the SM-TNF's will enable us to evaluate their potential to inhibit the effects of unmodified TNF (which is useful, e. g., in treating sepsis) as well as their potential to provide more active analogs of TNF.",

In phase I of the proposed work, a survey of the most needed packages will be conducted and a specification will be written to further develop the packages under Phase II. Therefore the goals are: 1. Develop an industry survey asking users to describe the features in any of the packages mentioned above and gain feedback on requirements for packages other than those identified based upon the industry's needs. 2. Develop a draft specification for each pakcage. In those cases where the functionality can be so well defined as to specify the procedural interfaces, this specification may be as detailed as a VHDL package declaration, or alternatively the specification may describe the subprograms and types needed in the abstract and leave the detailed design for Phase II.

An integrated capability, such as the one proposed, provides significant advantages over existing tactical radios. Application of advancecd communications techniques, new electronis technology and state-of-the-art mechanical design can yeild a small light-weight device which is more easily integrated into the battlefield and provides better performance. The low lost of the approach permits wide distribution which greatly enhances troop coordination and the dissemination of tactical information. The ability to search and scan over a wide frequency band provides the capability to easily monitor friendly and enemy communications and future capabilities could include decryption and dehopping of ECCM signals as well as LPI transmit for local two-way communication. ViaSat proposes to modify an existing hand-held radio to provide the required capabilities. Phase I will define requirements, select a candidate radio to provide high level designs for a demonstration. Phase II will produce a proof-of-concept demonstration closely matching the form, fit, and function of a Full Scale Development in Phase III.",

By facilitating the ability of UGVs to share information and adaptively optimize their relative positions based on specific goals, the MVCCS can act as a significant force multiplier for a wide variety of missions. Mission goals which can benefit from such a capability include things like communications link optimization and relay for extended range, cooperative path finding, interactive target recognition and position location, cooperative EW (e.g. jamming or spoofing), and cooperative reconnaisance. Overall UGV mission reliability should also be greater improved by the ability to autonomously and mutually adapt to changing mission situations such as enemy movements, jamming or spoofing. Phase I will establish the requirements and architecture of the MVCCS as well as implement an interactive simulation for demonstration, evaluation and concept validation.

        "abstract": "It is proposed to experimentally explore two active separation-control concepts aimed at stall alleviation and maximum-lift improvement on generic, vortex-dominated fighter configurations. The concepts comprise a delta wing incorporating transversely-hinged apex flaps oscillating in the pitch plane, and a LEX-trapezoidal wing combination with root-hinged LEX's oscillating in the cross-plane. The common purpose of the active devices is to establish a hysteresis loop with average lift higher than the undisturbed wing lift at the same angle of attack. Even if the wing flow-field moves in and out of stall, it is anticipated that the time-averaged lift will be considerably improved. Low-speed wind tunnel tests will be conducted on two wing-body models in a wide range of angle of attack and with varying control surface frequency and amplitude parameters, measuring time-averaged six-component aerodynamic coefficients, wing surface pressures and near-wake velocity components, to determine the feasibility of the active devices and quantify their effectiveness. The potential of non-symmetrical activation of the devices for lateral control near stall will also be explored.",

We are developing an attenuated strain of Vibrio cholerae, Peru-3, as a vaccine vector harboring ETEC-derived foreign genes encoding the major subunit of colonization factor antigen CFA/IV fimbriae, and a genetic toxoid of ST. Such a vector is expected to elicit i) anti-fimbrial antibodies, precluding binding of pathogenic ETEC strains to the human gut epithelium, and ii) anti-ST antibodies, negating the diarrheal effects of ST.

Because there is no ETEC vaccine animal model concurrent with the human ETEC constructs, we will produce a vector possessing a gene encoding AF/R1; AF/R1 is derived from a pathogenic E. coli, (RDEC-1) infectious to rabbits.

This is to be followed with experimental communication paths constructed with geometries to scatter via the heated volume irregularities, thus providing a new means of connectivity or communication netween distant points. Over-the Horizon radars located in Alaska or near the East Coast of the U.S. will be considered for use together with ionospheric heating facilities also located in Alaska and Puerto Rico, respectively to analyze and provide the best experimental plan. The Phase II program will use the selected geometries, together with appropriate diagnostics to provide a demonstration of the capabilities.",

        "abstract": "We will develop a multigas analyzer for anesthesia that is based on an innovative technology. This unique device for anesthesia and respiratory monitoring has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of health care without lowering the level of care. The instrument is based on a new analyzer configuration for ion mobility spectroscopy. The robust and compact design can be made inexpensively (as low as one tenth of the cost of conventional analyzers) using printed circuit technology. A prototype device was tested in a pilot study; the results demonstrated the ability of the device to measure the concentration in O2 in the three commonly used volatile halogenated anesthetics: Halothane, Isoflurane, and Enflurane. The study also proved the ability of the device to identify the anesthetic agent being measured. We will develop and evaluate a clinical prototype anesthetic multigas analyzer as part of our Phase I research plan. The objective is a prototype capable of monitoring the anesthetic agent concentrations in both inspired and expired air, at a clinically acceptable sampling rate, and compensating for the effects of humidity, temperature and pressure.",

Studies state that up to 23% nursing home and 10% of hospital admissions of the elderly are due to poor medication compliance. Current attempts to electronically augmented compliance have not been well accepted due to the following problems: 1) high cost $30-$75; 2) complicated programming and use (too many options and dis- plays); 3) units have been bulky; 4) units require pill reloading at home; 5) electronics units do not come in familiar package programmed and issued by the pharmacist. We will research an innovative, yet inexpensive, system to promote a high degree of medication compliance through electronic audio/visual cues. This system solves the aforementioned problems by being 1) low priced ($9.99 suggested retail), 2) simple to use (no user operable controls except removing the cap), 3) no bigger than a standard pill container, 4) uses the existing pill vial (requires no reloading), and 5) is programmed by the pharmacist and issued with the medication.",

The technical aim is to develop the ultrasonic horn assembly, to have the dimensions adequate for minimally invasive surgery, and to have the tip vibration characteristics suitable for efficient emulsification of cancerous tissues. The Phase I encompasses the necessary theoretical calculations and modeling required to design and develop prototype ultrasonic device for minimally invasive surgery. The prototype device will be tested in in vitro trials on human cancerous tissues to determine the effectiveness of the device and its optimum parameters.

The mechanism of HEBS is that it can, via oscillatory motion of working fluids or steady state circulating flow, remove contaminants from groundwater accumulated in a subsurface collector at rates exceeding that of pure molecular dispersion by several order of magnitude. This rapid removal of contaminants in groundwater creates a hydrodynamical barrier. Such a hydrodynamical barrier, superimposed on existing slurry wall, effectively prevants hazardous substances from dispersing into surrounding groundwater and/or surface water systems. When operating in oscillating flow mode, the contaminants can be removed from groundwater without pumping the groundwater out, which is especially important for those hazardous-waste landfill sites where the water table is shallow and treatment off-site is difficult or limited. The present study is proposed with the aim to better understand the temporal and spatial behavior of contaminant diffusion and the formation of the hydrodynamical barrier with the Enhanced Mass Pump (EMP) which is the key component in the HEBS.",

The device will be ruggedized and deployable so that its utility will not be limited to engine test cells but could also be used in the field. In order to accomodate the requirements for survivability and accuracy in a harsh environment, the infrared sensor head will be remote from the optical probe and connected by an optical relay system. The optical head will utilize a film-cooled window to provide an adequate signal-to-noise ratio. Along the optical path, the internal optical cavities will be cooled using water jackets to ensure an adequate signal-to-noise ratio.

        "abstract": "Projectiles launched at hypervelocities at the ballistic ranges of Arnold Enginering Development Center are subject to extreme loads of over 100,00 g's and occasionally fail. The ultimate material strength, in practice, limits the maximum speed to which the projectile can be launched and still remain intact. It is thought projectiles ballot, or rock back and forth, within the bore and that this could be a source of projectile failure. Balloting is a little understood dynamic, and many potential mechanisms may be responsible for this pitching motion. A more thorough understanding of the dynamics of projectile balloting could lead to improved projectile designs and operational procedures to reduce the possibility of model failure without degrading the overall performance of the gas gun. This proposal addresses the need for an analytical tool to explore the nature of balloting. Under Phase I, a simple conceptual model will be developed to investigate a broad range of potential mechanisms, including barrel misalignment, side wall friction, unbalanced axial pressure loads, and unbalanced-load pressure loads. Mechanisms identified as likely candidates for balloting will then be further analyzed using two- and three-dimensional finite elements to assess the magnitude of the balloting-induced stresses. Finally, two concepts for experiments will be studied: a laser-based angle sensor to measure in situ projectile balloting and a shock tube experiment to measure aerodynamic moments on a fixed body within the tube. Numerical simulations and experimental studies will be conducted in Phase II, and the actual prediction system, including hardware and software, will be developed.",

        "abstract": "The proposed study will evaluate the feasibility of adapting medium format metric camera systems for aerial photogrammetry from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform. The new generation of UAVs have the capacity to carry medium format (up to 5 cm x 7 cm) metric cameras suitable for precision photogrammetry. These platforms also offer automonous operations and simplified takeoff and landing options that minimize pilot skill requirements. This development will reduce the cost of photogrammetric monitoring of large structures in remote regions. We plan to apply the system to the study of sea ice deformation. A UAV would allow cost-effective, repetitive imaging of rafting, ridging and lead formation associated with floe scale interactions of polar sea ice. Photogrammetric techniques will allow quantitative measurements of horizontal displacements associated with these deformations. Stereophotogrammetry offers the potential to map the sea ice topography. The proposed work will include an evaluation of development requirements to provide the vibration isolation, tilt stabilization, enviromental controls, and motion compensation required for aerial photogrammetry and stereophotogrammetry. Evaluations of flight planning, image processing requirements, and Arctic logistics will also be carried out.",

This proposal concentrates on the effects due to the presence of airborne particles. The ground-level aerosol model currently implemented is rather crude and needs to be refined. In the proposed study, the generation of airborne particles from local soil sources will be investigated theoretically based on our understanding of turbulence diffusion and sediment transport processes. The results will allow us to evaluate the error in estimates of aerosol number density due to the negligence of the vertical gradient and wind dependence close to the ground. Building upon this theoretical framework, as well as field data assimilation, we will establish an aerosol model for the lower boundary layer that contains explicit functional dependence of the elevation and wind speed. The new aerosol model will be used for extinction and scatter computations, which will enable enhancement of the performance of optical and acoustic sensors in ground-level applications. The computation of extinction, visibility, transmission attenuation, target acquisition probability, image obscuration, and image resolution will be improved through more accurate estimation of the number density and size distribution of airborne particles along ground-level propagation paths.",

A technique is proposed to identify and characterize MIC-affected tubing and piping through the use of advancced and cost-effective NDE methods. The concept is based on a noncontact, laser-based sensor assembly that employs data fusion of laser-based profilometry and flourescence spectroscopy data obtained by a single probe. The resulting inspection system will be able to scan the length of a tube or pipe rapidly and accurately and generate a detailed topographic map of the internal surface. Superimposed on this image will be a color map that identifies the presence of MIC. The results will be displayed in a number of computer-graphic formats that will allow operators to both qualitatively and quantitatively assess the level and severity of wall loss due to pitting and determine the presence and extent of MIC-affected surfaces. The system will significantly advance the state of the art of NDE and will operate cost-effectively on both tubing and piping.",

Among those properties are the expected values and variances. The method is shown to be computationally efficient. It is general enough to account for submerged complex structures as well as large number of random variables, such as concentrated masses and/or uncertain internal boundary conditions (impedances). The flexibility of the method makes its extension to more demanding and complicated systems straightforward.

        "abstract": "The goal of this research project is to explore the feasibility of developing a powerful new visible light imaging array for use in a camera system and potentially applicable to a variety of medical and biotechnology uses. This innovative imaging technology involves use of Visible Light Photon Counting (VLPC) diodes, which allow the potential of two dimensional array imaging at high readout rates in extreme low-light conditions. The specific goals of this Phase I project include the acquisition of engineering samples of the VLPC detectors, the processing (thinning) of the detectors to enable rear illumination, and the characterization of the detectors and suitable readouts at cryogenic temperatures. These tasks will enable a proof-of-concept of the proposed camera, characterization of descriptive parameters of the camera detectors in actual operation, and evaluation of pragmatic tasks required to prepare the diode arrays for use in the camera. All of these issues are critical and must be satisfactorily addressed before advancing to construction of a manufacturable camera and testing of the actual camera in medical applications during the Phase II effort.",

        "abstract": "The ultimate goal is to develop and commercialize a functional, low-cost system for machine reading and recognition of chemical structure diagrams. The specific Phase I goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of developing such a system by using a knowledge-based approach which provides a logical method for expanding the chemical symbol recognition domain and for handling exceptions to recognition rules. Prior work on system design, algorithm development and literature research supports our contention that developing a useable chemical reader is feasible. The chemical reader will find application as an intelligent input device for entry of chemical structure data into chemical information systems. Yearly, thousands of structures must be entered into large databases by specially trained persons. In addition, searches of these databases by chemistry researchers often require input of structural information. The chemical reader will enable entry of structural information via universally recognized diagrams instead of using system specific codes. We have described a knowledge-based approach to developing the chemical reader. This approach has been successfully used by others in systems designed to recognize line drawings. In the chemical reader, system a knowledge base will be built which contains rules incorporating knowledge of chemistry and diagramming conventions. The rules will use facts obtained from feature extractors operating on pattern primitives derived from 2D gray level images of structure diagrams. The images can be acquired using either optical scanners or CCD camera/frame grabber devices. The result of processing the structure diagram will be a connection table, the standard representation for chemical structures.",

Gingivitis is largely caused by bacterial activity. Efforts to control intraoral flora by the use of antimicrobial agents, particularly chlorhexidine compounds, have been promising. By incorporating chlorhexidine compounds in a water soluble dental floss lubricant, the antimicrobial will be deposited directly into the interdental spaces which are most susceptible to disease. The relative ease of use of the system will encourage patient compliance and could offer the possibility of dental prophylaxis in difficult situations such as hospital wards or for military personnel in the field. Several different chlorhexidine compounds with differing solubility rates will be prepared. Growth zone inhibition tests will be performed on the lubricant prepara- tions. Promising preparations will be tested in vitro using tooth models to determine the effectiveness of transfer to the tooth surface and continued activity against oral pathogens. Results of this testing should lead to the selection of a system capable of delivering optimal levels of medication for effective preventive dental care.",

In Phase I, we will develop clinical algorithms to precisely describe malignant melanoma.

Phase I will demonstrate what are the relative weights of critical features to be combined to generate a simple clinical rule for melanoma diagnosis. Phase II will add one more analytic feature: computer-determined visual texture. What texture measures best help to distinguish melanoma from irregular seborrheic keratoses? Analysis as in Phase I will be performed for benign pigmented lesions and will include development of software for computer-assisted instruction for improved clinical diagnosis of pigmented lesions. Future application of computer vision diagnostic assistance systems might enable low-cost screening of large groups for pigmented lesions.

The novel copolymer will have mechanical strength, high aldehyde functionality, hydrophilicity, solubility in casting solvents, and hydrolytic and oxidative stability. The activated membranes manufactured from it will possess aldehyde groups on their internal pore surfaces. These aldehydes can covalently react with the amines in proteins and polyamines (Schiff base reaction). Our Phase I objectives will be to synthesize a matrix of copolymers; characterize their mechanical and solubility properties, use these materials to prepare and characterize prototype membranes, and test one by immunoassays (ELISA). Our activated membrane is designed to have stronger enzyme binding and lower nonspecific binding than commercial competitors. During Phase II, we will optimize the membrane and control its properties: pore size, rates of flow and wicking, and concentration of aldehydes.

If dual-energy digital subtraction angiography could be performed in clinical practice using intravenous iodine injections, patient risk could be substantially reduced. Additionally, x-ray exposure of the angiographer and other technical personnel during the catheter manipulation/placement would be eliminated. This project would evaluate combining two newly developed capabilities to achieve such a dual-energy angiography system. Science Research Laboratory (SRL) has constructed a compact high-flux characteristic-line x-ray anode source for dual-energy angiography. The effectiveness of this source would be greatly enhanced if the high energy continuum photon flux in the x-ray spectrum could be attenuated. Recent advances in Kumakhov optics utilizing x-ray capillary optics have demonstrated the ability to focus x-ray beams and to filter out high-energy photons. The expected result is a complete system would sequentially provide two very narrow x-ray spectra which bound the iodine K-edge for use in dual-energy digital subfraction angiography. The research performed in Phase I will establish the feasibility of filtering the characteristicline x-ray spectrum with a capillary optic. In Phase II, a Kumakhow x-ray will be constructed and tested with the SRL x-ray source.",

Most therapeutic decisions are currently based on information obtained through digital angiography. Standard angiographic images may not provide angiographers with sufficient information needed to make therapeutic decisions. The long-term goal of this project is to develop a volume tomographic angiography imaging (VTAI) technique to provide angiographers with useful 3-D vascular images needed for diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. VTAI combines volume tomographic imaging principles with those of digital angiography. VTAI may require only a single contrast injection and volume scan to provide a true 3-D description of vascular anatomy and stenoses in head, neck and abdomen. This project (Phase I) is an attempt to improve the performance of certain 3-D reconstruction algorithms for use with real time 2-D angiographic images generated by a specially designed rotational angiographic digital imaging (ROAD) system. A specially modified CT gantry has been equipped with an image intensifier subsystem to model the ROAD system. This work has been completed and will be used to provide model data sets for the software research effort. The clinical significance of this technique is to simplify the procedure, reduce the amount of injected contrast media, and total x-ray dose and the procedure time. This technique will supply the angiographer with a direct, unambiguous and accurate measurement of the severity of the stenoses, their geometry and spatial orientation, and allowing optimal randomly oriented viewing of vascular structures during a post processing diagnostic session.",

        "abstract": "An intelligent, redundant end effector is proposed for use as part of an intelligent automation system. The end effector is compact, lightweight, and provides up to six degrees of freedom over a limited workspace. The design is modular being composed of a number of interchangeable linear actuators which can be scaled to accomodate different force, bandwidth, and accuracy requirements. Phase I technical objectives are to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed design and to trade design configurations and controllers against size, weight, power, and computation complexity metrics. Phase II objectives will be to build and demonstrate the proposed end effector's performance within a hierarchically controlled system. Phase I tasks include fabrication and testing of an innovative linear actuator, which is a key element of the end effector design, and the development of the software algorithms and algorithms and analysis tools. Improvements and enhancements to the actuator and end effector designs will be sought. Anticipated Phase I results include development of an end effector mechanism and controllers, and successful preparation for Phase II tasks. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: Intelligent control lowers the cost, improves the performance, and increases accessibility of commercial automation systems. Commercial applications extend to nearly all industrial robot and automation systems proposed in this SBIR.",

The intent is to provide a controls design methodology which allows hardware and software reconfigurations and leverages the ease and simplicity of down loading design parameters to a well defined and robust adaptive control system. An automated controls design will be computer implemented and used to determine the appropriate gains and filters given the FFRRV configuration. This will then be down loaded as machine code using a commercially available auto-code generator to a flight processor commanding a defined architecture of multiple control loops i.e. torque, rate, attitude and velocity loops. Off the shelf commercial grade hardware for inertial instruments, transmitters/receivers, and electric servos/controller will be compiled and evaluated for modularity and maintainability.

        "abstract": "Crevice corrosion is a form of localized corrosion that occurs within crevices or at sheiled surfaces where stagnant solution is present. Crevices corrosion is particularly problematic for the Navy in networks of seawater piping where the numerous gasketed junctions are susceptible to crevice corrosion. Since the crevice corrosion is almost always confined to within the crevice itself, the pipe joints must be periodically disassembled and visually inspected for evidence of crevice corrosion. This process is time consuming, tedious, and expensive. Based on the mechanistic aspects of crevice corrosion, we will investigate three novel remote sensing concepts for crevice corrosion. These concepts are applicable to pipes of varying sizes and are capable of being developed into a remote diagnostic procedure for crevice corrosion. Such a procedure is adaptible to portable instrumentation for the detection of crevice corrosion within an assembled gasketed pipe joint. This instrumentation will eliminate the requirement for disassemble and visual inspection of pipe joints and will be of great benefit to the Navy.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this program is to develop, analyze, and assess the performance of a system for locating the position of HF and VHF transmitters using energy from these transmitters that incidentally scatters from metor trails. The proposal presented a candidate algorithm for meteor scatter position location (MSPL), which requires only angle of arrival data (both azimuth and elevation) for a number of scattered signals from several different receiving locations. The Phase I effort includes: evaluating this and other candidate algorithms for their capability to perform the MSPL mission; designing and evaluating the performance of systems for implementing these algorithms; selecting the best algorithm based on its estimated error performance and on the practiciality of its implementation; detailing the system design, specifying the performance of its critical components, and determining the minimum antenna baseline; and estimating the system's error statistics as a function of basic measurement errors, emitters ERP, range, propagation variances, etc. MSPL systems require extremenly accurate measurement of a signal's angle of arrival. Novel Difference-of-Time-of-Arrival Receivers for Direction Finding, developed by the proposing firm under U.S. Government sponsorship, have demonstrated angular resolution of 0.03 milliradian. These will be evaluated as key elements of the MSPL system. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: MSPL systems can locate an emitter (hostile or friendly) when all normal communication channels are closed. MSPL systems candetermine both the location and the axis of meteor trails, and may be configured to generate statistical data of these meteor events, a capability which may be of interest to atmospheric physicists and other in the scientific community.",

This technique is based on the following considerations for ultrasonic NDT of thick composite components: high attenuation, low signal-to-noise ration (s/n), and anisotropy. Low frequency and high power along with specially designed transducers can increase the penetration capability of the ultrasonic waves. An effective computer program, split spectrum processing (SSP), will also be applied to this technique to increase s/n. The sector B-scan in different directions provides information about fiber orientation as well as defects. Transducers with a special soft front plate to match the complex shape surfaces of the composite components will be designed. The sensitivity and resolution of this system will be further examined.

All military aircraft employ large numbers of antenna apertures for a wide variety of communication and radar functions. An ideal smart-skin would consist of a multi-function, multi-mode antenna integrated into the aircraft skin to provide a single, reconfigurable sensor suite capable of performing all of the required avionics functions for a given combat aircraft. American Sputtering Technologies has developed a unique sputtering process system that has the flexibility and capability to manufacture conductive smart-skin structures that incorporate embedded electronics for sensing applications. We propose to manufacture a new material that combines the best composite materials with our advanced metallization techniques. The proposed program will utilize close coordination with both Northrop Corporation and TRW MEAD, so that qualified test scenarios and viable aircraft structural composite systems are addressed. Several coupon samples will be metallized and subjected to stress/adhesion tests. The identification of successful metal/composite systems that are low cost and lightweight is the primary goal for Phase I. The Phase II effort will concentrate on increasing the physical size and production volume of these conductive smart-skin structures and the generation of a mechanical property data base.",

        "abstract": "The dynamic range of modern image sensors can exceed the range of a video monitor by an order of magnitude or more. This means that fast and intelligent range compression and image enhancement must be interposed between the sensor and display for effective surveillance and target tracking. Digital hardware can enhance an image in real time, but the common method for range compression on digital hardware, linear filtering, can severely distort the image. We propose to research and develop integrated analog image processors with nearest-neighbor interconnect architectures that carry out nonlinear filtering for range compression and image enhancement at video rates. The nonlinear filtering intelligently compresses the range without distortion. Digital processors, which comsume orders of magnitude more power than this kind of processor, are not capable of applying a similarly effective and distortion-free algorithm in real time. Our Phase I effort will include the design, fabrication and test of circuits to improve the state of the art of such processors, and will include the demonstration and evaluation of an EXISTING low-resolution analog video image processor. Our approach will utilize commercial CMOS/bulk integrated circuit technology; products arising from this R&D can be fabricated reliably and economically by a number of vendors.",

        "abstract": "We propose to design and develop a system of manufacturing integrated circuits in small and medium volume using shared masks. Current gate array manufacture dedicates high cost masks to each chip design. For high volumes, this cost is acceptable because it is amortized over a large number of chips. For typical small DoD volumes, the tooling costs make the chips' unit cost 10 to 100 times the high volume unit cost. Our method shares common mask and fabrication costs among 10 to 100 different designs, thus dramatically reducing the cost of each design. Shared mask technology has been successfully used for years by the DARPA-funded MOSIS service, but shared mask technology has never been applied to produce low cost gate arrays in low volumes. Our Phase I effort will include the design, FABRICATION and testing of sample gate arrays, and the investigation of two advanced concepts. The first idea leads to increased flexibility of the size of gate arrays and therefore reduces the startup costs of the shared-mask gate array manufacturing process. The second idea targets the lowering of costs for medium volume fabrication runs. Phase II will include a full-scale multi-project gate array fabrication run and transition to a Phase III commercial service providing the Navy and commercial customers with low-volume gate arrays at less than 1/10th their current cost.",
