        "abstract": "This proposal investigates the feasibility of using a systems analytic approach to model the critical processes supporting proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It uses as a framework for synthesis a previously developed systems analysis model of biological weapons proliferation. The proposed approach consists of four tasks to: 1) extend the BW analytical process to encompass all WMD, 2) develop surrogate indicators which will allow screening for latent capabilities for WMD, 3) modify the model to allow detection of proliferation attempts by extra-national entities, and 4) investigate ways of making the dynamic linking structure of the systems analysis approach visible. Anticipated Benefits: The model of proliferation dynamics which would result from our proposed effort would help focus resources in the proliferation areas of greatest need, suggest ways in which our resources devoted to countering proliferation could be best allocated, and be used to examine policy initiatives for their effect on global WMD proliferation propensities. The process methodology has application to business in the area of competitive analysis.",

        "abstract": "While auditory evoked responses are often used for objective assessment of hearing, especiallyin infants, such responses do not provide an adequate measure of low-frequency hearing. This, in turn,makes more difficult the selection of a hearing aid appropriate for the patient's hearing deficit.Evaluation of the auditory evoked response is especially difficult because of the brain's response totransient changes in the sound stimulus, and because of temporal overlap of the responses. Both ofthese problems are eliminated by a new method, to be tested in this research, which retrieves auditoryevoked responses to continuous low-frequency tones. If successful, this research will overcome a majorproblem in the evaluation of low-frequency hearing in infants.",

        "abstract": "This project is intended to provide computational resources to users of Dipole Source Localization(DSL) methods to allow them to decide whether or not their DSL results are distorted by certain errorscalled model misspecification errors. These errors are essentially due to incorrect weighing constantsin the computation of the relationship between source dipole parameters and the surface potential. Sucherrors occur when head model simplifications are used, such as a one-shell as contrasted to a morerealistic 3-shell model, and when a spherical model is employed instead of a more realistic head model.Errors in single dipole localization are magnified when multiple dipoles are required to model the sourcesof brain potentials. A relatively simple method for estimating misspecification errors has been devised(called the AB-plane technique) and examined using simulated data for models using one or two dipoles.The method permits the identification of models that are insufficiently accurate to produce valid DSL,and to compare models for their relative accuracy. In order to use the method on real (as contrasted tosimulated) data in which the contributions of each dipole is unknown an extension of the AB-planeestimation technique called the EF-plane method will be used. Although accurate definition of the EFplane is not possible, since the variables that define it are unknown, it is proposed that a close enoughestimate might be obtained using singular value decomposition. It is indicated that even if this approachis not entirely accurate, that it will nevertheless be sufficiently close to the AB-plane estimate to disclosemodel misspecification errors.",

The resulting adaptive test generation, analysis, and control modeling system will demonstrate the feasibility of developing a revolutionary test definition and analysis product capable of adapting in a dynamic environment, monitoring and diagnosing complex system behavior, and predicting future faults and maintenance requirements. The innovation is the application of learning software to modeling, sensitivity analysis, and test- synthesis and diagnosis. The AIM test system is designed to enhance a systems engineer's ability to understand system interactions, make decisions on a systems ability to complete a desired function, determine the effect that a component has on the overall system, and perform system validation.

        "abstract": "High-risk newborn infants in an intensive care unit often suffer significant morbidity and mortalitybecause of infectious illnesses which elude early diagnosis and are present in advanced stages withcirculatory shock. Earlier diagnosis and therapy might present in advanced stages with circulatoryshock. Earlier diagnosis and therapy might prevent or reduce late complications and deaths. A strategyfor early detection of impending catastrophic events should reduce mortality as well as hospital costs.Our research is based on the fact that the time between successive heartbeats varies incessantly. Innewborn infants, this heart rate variability is reversibly reduced during severe illness. During thisprogram, this heart rate variability is reversibly reduced during severe illness. During this program, theheart rate variability of hospitalized, at-risk newborn infant will be monitored to test the hypothesis thata decrease in heart rate variability presages a catastrophic infectious illness. Preliminary researchsupports this hypothesis. heart rate variability data will be processed using an innovative multi-linearanalysis technology: polynomial networks. Polynomial networks have been successfully applied to manydata processing challenges in the fields of health care, financial modeling, and pattern recognition. Thiswill result in clinically useful indices to quantify heart rate variability. The long-term objective of thiseffort is to test the hypothesis that monitoring heart rate variability will lead to earlier diagnosis and moreeffective therapy of catastrophic infectious illnesses in newborn infants, and thus be useful for a varietyof clinical practices.",

A language parsing and encoding system in ANN (a leading semantic understanding software package) will be used to parse and encode ASCII output resulting from a voice recognition system such as DragonDictate. The ASCII output from the voice recognition system will go to the ANN language encoding facility that will parse the sentence and assign deep meaning to the words as a function of context. The encoded strings corresponding to the spoken words will go to information processing modules development with AIM, which will have been trained on variable constructs permissible in English so that the encoded word meaning strings can be used to select an appropriate response to the user. The NASA CLIPS expert system will be used to create expert systems capable of activating the command sequences needed for the various packages to accomplish the result desired by the user or to activate and display the function requested by the user. ANN will determine from parsing the sentence and asking any required clarifying questions the universe of context and will then encode the words. The codes would be used to train AIM networks to select the correct response. Training sets would be prepared for each category we determined was going to be included in the automated office suite of capabilities. After training these or equivalent statements would cause the AIM models to select the appropriate application package activation sequence. Because of the robustness of the AIM network models, statements that had not been part of the training package but were similar would also produce a desired response.",

        "abstract": "Ganuna (7)-ray lenses are an advanced technology currently under development at Argonne National Laboratory for arms control application. The purpose of this proposal is to address whether y-ray lens technology can enable an improved system for imaging radioactive isotopes in patients. In nuclear medicine, it is often desirable to generate a y-ray image that shows the exact areas where an emitting isotope is located. The motivation for proposing a y-ray lens for radionucide imaging is the potentially significant advantages that it may provide over existing technology, specifically in terms of superior image resolution, reduced radioactive dose to the patient, and cost. The proposed effort will develop the conceptual design of a y-ray lens system for radioactive isotope imaging, predict its performance, estimate its cost, and compare it with existing nuclear medicine imaging technology. The questions this work will answer are: (1) Does the y-lens provide better resolution than existing systems? (2) Does they-lens efficiency enable lower radioactive doses to be administered to patients? (3) Can the y-lens system be built sufficiently compact to fit within existing treatment facilities? The answers to these questions will establish the practical feasibility of 7-ray lenses for imaging radioactive isotopes in patients. Anticipated Benefits: The anticipated benefits of a y-ray lens system for radioisotope imaging include: superior imaging, less patient exposure to radioactive dose, and cost savings. There are also a number of other potential conu-nercial applications of y-ray lenses, including angiography optics (cardiac imaging), arms control instrumentation, and cancer therapy. This proposed effort will determine whether y-lens technology is commercially feasible for these.",

The LoFlyte program will hasten the coming age of hypersonic flight. Years of research have gone into optimizing the NASP aerodynamics for high speeds. If we can prove these aerodynamics at low speeds and lay the foundations for the required technologies in design, structures, materials, and manufacturing, we will have taken a giant step towards the goal of cost effective hypersonic flight. A generation of hypersonic cruise vehicles and cruise missiles could follow the LoFlyte program.",

Two approaches, rotating screen display and reciprocating screen display, are proposed to achieve this goal. In this project, the feasibility of the VID devices will be demonstrated and their performance potential will be evaluated. Anticipated Benefits: The VID can be applied for the discrimination of different types of seismic events and for visualizing other mutlidimensional data problems.

There are two aims of this proposal: 1) to provide evidence for theexistence of a putative ARAg counter-receptor (ARAg-CR) expressed which presumably interacts withARAg in transduction of important activation signals, and 2) to isolate a cDNA clone encoding the murinehomologue of ARAg. Soluble recombinant ARAg proteins will be engineered and used in flow cytometryassays to examine phenotypic expression of the putative ARAg-CR on relevant cell types. Evidence forthe existence of a putative ARAg-CR will provide an additional target for potential pharmacologicintervention. Molecular cloning of the murine ARAg homologue is essential for development of an animalmodel in which to evaluate candidate ARAg-based therapeutics in vivo. The long-term objective of thisproject is to develop ARAg-related reagents for their potential therapeutic value in allograft rejection andGVHD as well as autoimmune disease and reperfusion injury.",

Active wing research, conducted for many years, continues today as an important element in advanced aircraft technology. This program will analytically demonstrate the use of piezoceramic sensors and actuators, in conjunction with a adaptive neural network estimation process, to actively suppress vibration of the first bending and first torsion modes of a full-scale wing model without the use of traditional flap actuators. Force, stroke, and power requirments will guide the placement and configuration of distributed surface-bonded piezoceramic elements. A fully-coupled, nonlinear, aero-structural-electromechanical numerical wing model will be used to evaluate a unique adaptive control architecture, potentially eliminating the requirement for augmenting aerodynamic states in flutter suppression techniques.",

        "abstract": "Recent research has shown that effective jammer and clutter suppression is best performed with fully space-time adaptive processing. However, allowing adaptive weights on every tap on every element is computationally prohibitive and requires too many samples to converge. Eigenvalue analysis shows that the required number of degrees of freedom (DOF) is significantly less than the dimensionality of the space-time data (i.e. the total # of DOF's). Therefore it should not be necessary to use adaptive weights on every tap of every element. The objective then becomes to reduce the number of DOF's (=adaptive weights) used for interference suppression. We propose a general and fundamental two-dimensional subband decomposition approach which optimally (in terms of canceller mean squared error) chooses the desired number of DOF's using an easily computed criterion. Each adaptive weight operates on a linear combination of sensor and tap data, rather than a subset of sensors and taps. M degrees of freedom corresponds to M linear combinations. Furthermore, these linear combinations are formed in a data-dependent but easily computed way, so that the DOF's can change as the interference changes.",

We propose the use of silicon carbide (SiC) substrates for the epitaxial growth of a III-V nitride vertical cavity laser. SiC is closely lattice-matched to the III-V nitrides, has comparable thermal expansion coefficients and is blessed with a large thermal conductivity. The vertical cavity laser incorporates a unique structure to further reduce defects and to increase device efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Future aeropropulsion systems require high temperature electronics and integrated sensors to meet desired performance levels. The wide bandgap of silicon carbide (SiC) makes it ideally suited for high temperature operation. To date, virtually all SiC-based devices have been fabricated using 6H-SiC. Device performance would significantly increase if 3C-SiC, the cubic form, were available. 3C-SiC has twice the electron and hole mobilities of 6H-SiC and a slightly higher saturated electron drift velocity. Higher mobility results in faster switching speeds, higher gain and lower on- resistances. 3C-SiC is not typically grown in the bulk form because it is not stable at typical sublimation growth temperatures. The objective of this proposal is to grow high quality 3C-SiC. We propose to do this through the development of a novel growth system which will support the large thermal gradients required to efficiently produce 3C-SiC. The anticipated results of this Phase I will be the demonstration of a viable growth process for high mobility 3C-SiC substrates. The benefits will be to make available 3C-SiC substrates and enable the manufacture of high performance devices and sensors capable of operating in harsh, high temperature environments.",

The development of a high dieletric constant capacitor material with 10 - 100 times the charge storage of SiO2 would allow a flat capacitor cell to be used in 256 Mb DRAMs, and simple stacked capacitors to be adopted for 1 and 4 Gb generations. IBM, TI and Micron have entered into an ARPA sponsored development agreement with ATM to develop chemical vapor deposition of BaSrTiO3 thin films for advanced DRAMs, but exploitation of this material requires new patterning technology, since conventional dry etching processes are ineffective. The Phase I effort will demonstrate the viability of novel metalorganic dry-etching chemistry for patterning Pt/BaSrTiO3/Pt capacitors. The work will be performed in a custom metalorganic-enhanced ion million (MEIM) system modified with ATM's Liquid Delivery System for controlled introduction of the metalorganic compounds. In Phase II the process will be optimized for 200 mm wafers and if successful this technology would fold-in to the ARPA Ultra-Dense capacitors DRAM consortium for fabrication of VLSI BaSrTiO3 test structures. Anticipated Benefits: The proposed research is a vital component needed to incorporate ferroelectric materials in integrated electronics.

In Phase I the feasibility of attaining this objective will be demonstrated by conducting a series of subscale experiments based upon a uniquely devised processing sequence that involves several advanced processing methods including: 1)Equal Channel Angular Extrusion (ECAE), 2)Superplastic Extrusion (SPE), 3)Stretch Straightening and, 4)Creep-Age Forming. ECAE offers a novel deformation approach to processing a large number of materials to obtain a variety of useful microstructures, including submicron grain sizes in thick sections. With the submicron grain sizes, certain high strength aluminum alloys can be formed or extruded superplastically into very thin cross section panels. The aluminum alloy flow stresses at working temperatures in the submicron/SPE process are much lower than in conventional extrusion. This allows more fragile extrusion dies thus allowing thinner section details and larger overall extruded panels for a given press capacity. ECAE process optimization experiments will be conducted on a selected aluminum-lithium alloy to produce submicron grain structure. Advance Technology Assocates (ATA) will subcontract SPE and Creep Age Forming experiments to Rockwell International Science Center (RISC).",

The arrival of single crystal silicon carbide substrates and high quality epitaxial layers make SiC the primary candidate for these dual-use applications based on its material techniques applied to silicon carbide, such as junction isolation, greatly complicate circuit fabrication. In this Phase I we will instead take a unique approach with SiC, previously applied to III-V materials, of controlling deep and shallow level impurities to produce a semi-insulating substrate. This Phase I program will also represent the first rigorous correlation of the electrical characteristics of deep and shallow levels attributable to known atomic impurity concentrations. ATM is uniquely suited to carry out this investigation based on its wide range of bulk and thin film SiC growth and characterization experience. In Phase II this work will be extended to produce improved semi-insulating substrates which will be used to fabricate prototype SiC integrated circuits. Anticipated Benefits: SiC electronics will enable devices providing new functionality that cannot be matched by Si or GaAs devices.

The solutions to these complex problems require the proper infrastructure and improved electronics technology to bring the ICE powered vehicle fully into the information era. This will require employing artificial intelligence to link the various control subsystems into an intelligent entity. One of the enabling technologies for this process is improved miniature distributed engine sensing subsystems. Deployment of intelligently coordinated sensor subsystems will substantially improve performance of ICE'S. Reliable, low cost, high performance miniature pressure sensors are a critically needed component for a wide range of future ICE systems. DOD has a need for robust embedded sensor technology for monitoring and control of internal combustion engines. We propose a novel robust strain sensor suited for the harsh ICE environment.

Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - The major advantages are the low cost robust strain sensor design, high sensitivity and high temperature capability.

Multi-contact systems were laterdeveloped to minimize the number of surgeries required to reposition electrodes. Today's electrodeshave up to eight contacts, however, lead migration and placement is still a problem. In addition to leadmigration, mechanical failures and the limited number of active contacts available with contemporaryleads has limited the therapeutic effectiveness of SCS. It would be a significant benefit to SCS patientsif more robust, reliable and higher current density electrodes could be provided.

This model will be used in conjunction with on-line Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) reflectance measurements to control epi-silicon growth in a cluster tool. AFR has successfully performed a field test at Texas Instruments for single-wafer epi-silicon film deposition in the cool-down chamber of a Centura 5200 cluster tool. This field test demonstrated the ability of FT-IR based on-line wafer-by-wafer measurements of thickness and doping density. With a development of appropriate models, the FT-IR reflectance measurements could be employed to control the cluster tool deposition process on a wafer-by-wafer base. The models include: a) A model for the complex dielectric function correlated with the doping density; b) A model for the reflectance from a layer with a duffuse interface; c) A model for the diffuse interface doping profile based on the thermal diffusion and epi-layer growth rate during the film growth process; d) A model for the control of the diffusion coefficient and growth rate. The proposed technology can also be applied to improve both wafer quality and yields for the production of poly-silicon, silicon oxide, silicon nitride, and silicon shallow junctions. This project will be led by the joint venture of AFR and On-Line Technologies, Inc. (On-Line). Texas Instruments, Inc. (TI) will be a subcontractor. Phase I will develop the models for FT-IR based monitoring and control for the production of epi-silicon films and prove the feasibility of data collection during production. To validate the models, measurements will be made using an On-Line FT-IR with calibration samples fabricated and characterized by TI. AFR will measure the ex-situ film characteristics and develop the analysis method and software. On-Line will design and construct the physical and optical interface for TI's cluster tool. Field tests will be done at TI. Phase II will modify the model based on actual manufacture processes, and plan for the implantation of the model in production.",

The elucidation of the chemcial mechanisms for fuel degradation would greatly benefit from the availability of on-line diagnostics for measurement of these products. The Phase I proposal is to develop a methodology for in-situ optical measurements of peroxide decomposition products and demonstrate how this information can be used to elucidate the chemical mechanisms of fuel degradation. The fuels would be studied under subcritical and supercritical conditions. The optical methods would include FT-IR and FT-NIR transmission spectroscopy. Experimental variables to be examined would include fuel type,time-temperature history, and the pressure or absence of dissolved oxygen. The Phase I program will demonstrate the capability of these optical diagnostics to make in-situ measurements of oxygenated species known to be involved in fuel degradation. The Phase II program will combine these techniques with previously developed diagnostics for mass deposit rate and composition into an advanced Fuel Stability Test System (FSTS). The FSTS will be used to make measurements for a suite of fuels and establish a database for model development. The final product of Phase II will be the advanced FSTS and a physicochemical model of fuel stability that could be a submodel for an comprehensive code for simulation of deposit formation under actual aircraft conditions.",

        "abstract": "SiC is an attractive material for high temperature, high frequency and high power electronic applications because of its wide band gap, high thermal conductivity, and high breakdown voltage. Two polytypes of SiC which have received the most attention are the 3C cubic structure and the 6H hexagonal structure due to their individual properties of higher electron mobility (1000 cm3/Vs) and larger band gap (2.9 eV), respectively. This proposal offers the development of a process for growing high quality (low defect density), epitaxial SiC films on 6H-SiC and Si substrates, using Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD). Preliminary research in our laboratory has demonstrated that epitaxial 3C-SiC thin films can be deposited on Si by PLD at substrate temperatures of 900-950 Degrees C using a novel surface precleaning method. By optimizing the process conditions, it should be possible to lower substrate temperature and grow device quality 3C-SiC films on Si. PLD should also be applicable to depositing high quality 3C- and 6H-SiC filmson 6H-SiC. Phase I research will demonstrate the deposition of high quality SiC films on 6H-SiC and Si substrates. Phase II will systematically improve size and quality of the films at commercially acceptable growth rates. OPTION TASK: None submitted",

        "abstract": "The inability to fabricate copper-based superconductors capable of transporting or circulating high current densities over large volumes has severely limited applications for wires and levitation. Difficulties in texturing these ceramic materials is due to the requirement for nearly perfect grain boundaries resulting from the small quasi particle coherence lengths. Control of the morphology and nature of defects or grain boundaries effecting vortex pinning is the key to expanding applications of these materials. We propose a method to create rapid melting and solidification in the presence of a giant thermal gradient along the c-axis of mechanically aligned bulk YBa2Cu307-x substrates. A fast-moving and directed, giant thermal gradient is energized by continuous wave C02 laser radiation. Objectives are directed toward developing a technology for fabricating large structures of high Jc copper-based superconductors relevant to wire and levitation applications. Experiments will be performed to define the best compositional pathways and optical parameters to control the ceramic morphology. Large structures of textured ceramics with a high density of pinning sites will find numerous NASA applications for magnetically levitated static and dynamical bearing systems requiring large forces, restoring forces (stiffness) and minimal rotational drag forces.",

The goal of the proposed research is to formulate, develop and test and evaluate efficient wavelet based algorithms for such applications directly at the level of the sensor data; i.e., algorithms that operate directly on the tomographic projections prior to any image formation or target detection or recognition procedures. The research is directed toward the class of applications, such as ultrasound tomography and radar imaging, where the object beng imaged is highly localized in image space so that the generalized projections are transient like and therefore ideally suited to wavelet analysis. The proposed research includes the development of iterative and non-iterative wavelet based generalized tomographic imaging algorithms and test and evaluation of these algorithms in ultrasound tomography and the recently developed \"chirp diversity radar\". Other applicatons such as medical x-ray computed tomography and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) will also be addressed.

This kind of measurement greatly relaxes the tolerances on vibration and coherence length. However, phase retrieval will be required to retrieve a 3-D image. Phase retrieval algorithms typically utilize some type of prior knowledge about the object. In industrial metrology and missile-imaging problems the objects will be opaque to the illumination and will appear as a warped 2-D surface embedded in a 3-D space. The opacity constraint promises to be very powerful since it greatly reduces the class of feasible objects from which to choose an estimate. We propose to demonstrate, in computer simulation and with laboratory data, 3-D imaging of opaque objects by using phase retrieval.",

Electrode deposition, as it is now practiced however, is a random process that covers active sites on the BASE and places many electrode pore openings at inactive sites. This proposal describes a novel fabrication process for improving electrode components of AMTEC cells. Exchange current densities will be increased by 500% at the BASE/electrode interface by selectively exposing all of the active sodium sites to the 3-phase electrode-BASE-sodium vapor boundary. The new process will selectively deposit the electrode only on the inactive sites of the BASE using the charge sensitive properties of the BASE to control where the electrode is deposited. This leaves the active sites of the BASE conduction plane at the electrode edges. This process will use the common electrode materials, Mo, W(Rh,Pt) and/or TiN. If successful, this process can increase the power output of an AMTEC cell by 50% without increasing the size or weight",

This unique diode laser based system addresses an immediate and acute need for advanced solid-state devices in medical applications (photodynamic therapy for cancer treatment as well as a number of restricted defense applications. Photodynamic therapy (PDT), the most promising cancer treatment to date, can greatly reduce medical expenses associated with cancer because the treatment has minimal side effects and can be done on an outpatient basis. To date, the only FDA-approved dye used for PDT absorbs at 630 nm. Portable, robust, compact, inexpensive, reliable 630 nm InGaP-based diode laser system will greatly reduce the cost of today's bulky argon ion-pumped dye PDT system. In addition, high power 630 - 650 nm InGaP/AlInGaP lasers are promising for other applications such as novel optical pumping of tunable solid state lasers, high definition displays, high-speed laser printers and high brightness illuminators. We anticipate that this diode based 630 nm laser system will have great pervasive impact in military applications and excellent commercial growth potential in clinical PDT treatment.",

This mixing technique coupled with a Lean-Burn Direct-Ignition (LBDI) combustion strategy will be used in a high-performance low-loss combustor design. This design addresses the aeropropulsion system component need for innovative combustors with greater efficiency, lower emissions, and reduced aerodynamic drag. The objectives of the proposed Phase I project are to explore the combustor design parameter space numerically and to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed concept experimentally. The results of the effort will provide parametric data on the combustor geometry that will be used in scaling the device to large annular systems for gas turbine applications as well as a proof of principle demonstration. The NASA applications and benefits include advanced ultra-low emission combustors to address the needs for improvement in technology for conventional subsonic aircraft and the high speed research program.",

This project will implement a unique new analysis capability to analyze and assess a novel propulsion device that could greatly enhance applications in the hypersonic class of flight vehicles. The ODW Hy-Scram Engine is configured to use gas dynamic wave interactions to provide inlet stream primary compression (after vehicle forebody compression), bulk ignition, and rapid combustion. The major advantages over previous Scramjet engines are: 1) use of the vehicle forebody for fuel injection and complete mixing (due to longer distances, lower temperatures and lower pressures than is typical in the inlet fuel injection systems of Scramjet Engines), 2) simpler and shorter inlet design due to lower Mach range through which the flow must be decelerated (typically incorporated into the vehicle forebody), and 3) shorter and simpler combustor design. The primary benefit of this approach is the reduction of the weight associated with the propulsion system for a given combustion efficiency. The secondary benefit is stabilized combustion due to the bulk ignition of the fuel and oxidizer in the stable over driving of the oblique detonation wave.",

Advanced Rotorcraft Technology will utilize the Phase I effort to carefully define the specification for the parallelization opportunitites in 2GCHAS.

Often vision can be restored by corneal transplantation but the procedure requires theavailability of a) suitable human corneal donor tissue; and b) a sophisticated eye banking system. It isfurther limited by the potential to transmit diseases such as AIDS and hepatitis. A significant advancewould be the availability of an artificial cornea. Among other properties, such a device must have asurface that promotes rapid re-epithelialization. A significant advance has been the development of asynthetic cornea model consisting of a transparent hydrogel center and a porous peripheral web. Withthis device it has been demonstrated that stromal keratocytes migrate into the porous web andsynthesize extracellular matrix proteins that anchor the device to adjacent recipient cornea. While thecentral hydrogel optic has desired optical and mechanical properties, its surface will not supportre-epithelialization without modification. We will use rf-plasma technology to modify the surfaceproperties of the anterior surface of the hydrogel and determine the modification conditions that will bestsupport continuous epithelial adherence, growth, and the deposition of an extracellular matrix in vitroand in vivo.",

The technology proposed also enables future incorporation of sequential RGB backlighting, that will improve AM-LCD performance by reducing the number of driving circuits by a factor of three, eliminate the spatially distributed RGB filters, triple the resolution for the same pixel size and triple the amount of light available from a given light source. The technology involves concentrating light from a relatively small point source with an optically efficient concentrator, transmitting the light to a unique extraction plate and extracting the light homogeneously and unidirectionally. In this approach the light will be conditioned (near IR exclusion) at the source thus drastically reducing the size of the filters required. The light can be conditioned for day and night viewing by using two interchangeable light conditioning filters between the light source and the collection optics. The overall optical losses are expected to be under 38%. The ability to provide dual spectral distribution in a single backlighting or sequential RGB cannot be duplicated in current fluorescent based backlights.",

The purpose of the proposed R&D is to extend the availability of formal methods of adequately trained engineers by coupling various real-time structured analysis design tools with any of a family of general purpose verification systems. Phase I research will determine the feasibility of developing an automated, extensible tool, called FM*Link, that supports the process of formal specification and reasoning about the temporal, liveness, and safety properties of hard real-time systems. Goals of this research include the extension of the RT/SA notation to cover additional formal method semantics within the system engineering domain and the preliminary design of a translator which converts state-based RT/SA behavior models and other design factors into verification system input modules. During Phase I, a proof-of-concept translator will be built and integrated into an in-house R&D tool framework as a demonstration of technical feasibility.",

Present methods for capturing, storing, and displaying visual scenes usually use digital electronics. These techniques are not able to record three dimensional (3-D) objects or visual scenes. On the other hand, those holographic visualization schemes use photographic films which are not directly compatible with digital data. The Advantech, Inc. proposes a new and innovative opto-electronic holographic system capable of capturing and storing the necessary Fourier transform data from one data set (object), with the potential to combine and display multiple data set, and to reconstruct a hologram. The proposal will capitalize on the recent advances in optical and electronic techniques. The optical method is based on the projection of variable gratings onto a 3-D object to get the 3- D information. The hologram is generated by using an opto- electronic hybrid system. By using the system, the Fourier transform or Fresnel diffraction pattern is calculated optically to avoid the slow computer calculations. The synthesis of the hologram can be done by a computer. The hologram is displayed on a spatial light modulator (SLM) for 3-D reconstruction. In the proposal, the principle of the method, the implementation and characteristics of the system, and planned tasks are presented in detail. Potential future applications have been discussed.",

        "abstract": "Spacecraft surface contamination can result from nozzle-exhaust molecules, droplets, and/or condensate-clusters which expand and scatter to fill the space volume at large angles from the nozzle thrust axis. Only a small fraction of the exhaust products expands to large angles; however, the amount is sufficient to influence the design and performance of spacecraft sensor platforms which are subject to contamination effects. The large-angle plume mass/species distribution functions depend on 1) the interacting effects of pressure/shear forces and diffusion/rarefaction effects during the rapid angular expansion at the nozzle lip and 2) the nozzle boundary layer characteristics upstream of the lip expansion. Current prediction methods include 1) method-of-characteristics for continuum regions and 2) direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) techniques for transitional regions. Composite predictions are cumbersome to implement; extremely high grid resolutions are required to preclude numerical diffusion across steep gradients. A new formulation is proposed which uses an extended form of the Navier-Stokes equations in flow-conformal curvilinear streamtube coordinates (to minimize numerical diffusion effects) with additional source/sink terms (to account for flow rarefaction effects). The formulation provides a unified continuous prediction capability which bridges from the continuum region of the nozzle interior to the rarefied region of the plume backflow.",

        "abstract": "Moller International (MI), the parent company of Aerobotics Inc. (AI), has been developing VTOl manned and unmanned aerial vehicles, called aerobots, for many years. The first electric aerobot used a 36 inch saucer-shaped composite airframe with four vertical ducts, each housing a small electric motor driving an eight inch propulsion fan. It was developed in 1986-87 under a contract funded by DARPA. The second significant aerobot developed was a radio-controlled, single-duct model powered by a 45 HP rotary engine developed under an SBIR contract and delivered to the U.S. Air Force in 1992. In December 1992, the aerobot technology was transferred from Moller International to its newly-activated subsidiary, Aerobotics Inc. (AI). Two aerobots are currently in development. One is a twin-engine, 20\" duct, fuel powered, radio controlled aerobot to be demonstrated in January 1994 under a U.S. Navy contract, in which Aerobotics Inc., as the UAV supplier, is a sub-contractor to The Stratos Group of Fairfax, VA, an organization with extensive military and civilian experience in UAV technology. The other is powered by two electric motors in a single 20\" duct, with a 200' cable attached carrying power, control signals and sensor images. The latest electric aerobot weighs approximately forty poiunds, including the cable. Development has been funded by the California Department of Transportation to enhance their inspections of bridges and other highway structures. This electric Aerobot can remain aloft indefinitely carrying a ten pound payload. It has been flying successfully for several months, proving that Aerobotics Inc. has the basic technology required to create the proposed vehicle. Participation in this project will enable Aerobotics Inc. to apply a concentrated effort to achieve the weight reduction needed to meet the thirty pound goal and to identfy the best batteries to achieve sustained flights. Miniature video and infra-red imaging systems will be sought to provide significant mission capabilities in small, lightweight sensors.",

Solder joints can be unreliable in high shock environments because of non-uniform adhesion. This program will develop an entirely new method for welding such joints. In this novel method, 50-500 nm diam monodisperse droplets of high temperature filler metal are generated remotely and then deposited at the joint to be welded. Almost any metal can be a filler, including the same metal as the those being joined. Droplet size and temperature are controlled so that the depth of the weld and therefore, its relability is also controlled. No flux or cleaning solvent is used in this process. Toxic heavy metal solder is replaced by benign filler metal. Since there is no contact of the energy source with the weld site, thermal or electrical damage to components is eliminated. In Phase I, copper, aluminum, and nichrome wires will be welded to copper foil on a circuit board (copper or aluminum filler). Weld strengths will be measured and correlated with the experimental parameters, droplet metal identity, size, and temperature. In phase II more detailed evaluations will be made to automate and scale-up the method in Phase III follow-on work.",

The deployment of IR countermeasures to protect aircraft from heat-seeking missiles, however, may remove the advantage of nighttime conditions and expose the aircraft to anti-aircraft artillery and small arms fire. Therefore, a need exists for an IR decoy which is effective against a variety of IR missile threats and also has little or no visible signature. This program addresses this need. The proposed program has two objectives; the identification and evaluation of promising approaches for the generation of a strong IR signature with a minimal visible signature; and, the testing and demonstration of an IR source having little or no visible signature. The program will include modeling the visible and IR signature of candidate concepts, and assessment of IR decoy effectiveness for the concepts based on existing data and simulation studies, and the testing and demonstration of the potential for high IR source intensity and minimal visible intensity for the best concepts.",

When used in a system incorporating a novel longpath, low volume absorption cell currently produced by ARI, the detection sensitivity with a 1 second time response is projected to be below 10 ppbv for hydrazine.

Since many metals form insoluble salts as products of corrosion reactions, it should be possible to monitor the extent of metal corrosion by measuring the surface coverage of these products. For example, aluminum, which is a major component of aircraft, reacts with sulfate ions in acidic solutions to form insoluble aluminum hydroxysulfates. These compounds have distinctive infrared absorptions which can be monitored using infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS). IRAS# which involves bouncing an infrared beam off of a reflective surface, is a highly sensitive nondestructive analytical technique for identifying and quantifying adsorbates on metal surfaces. It is capable of providing in situ information about the composition of the top few molecular layers of a surface in liquid or gaseous environments with submonolayer sensitivity.",

Efforts during the last five years have thus far identified alternative agents that have significantly reduced effectiveness (average +75% weight penalty), highter cost and ill-defined toxicologic properties. This Phase I program offers an affordable, retrofitable, performance enhancing fire extinguishing system design concept(s) for engine compartments which is compatible with alternative extinguishing agents while overcoming their performance shortfall. The system approach entails the rapid blockage and displaaement of combustion air from the engine compartment while simultaneously providing rapid, controlled distribution of the fire suppressing agent for \"total\" fire extinguishment and control. This rapid \"Block\", \"Displace\", and \"Distribute\" (BDD) multi-pronged attack reduces agent quantity requirements while providing for improved agent dispersion and longer dwell times. The Phase I program includes: materials/engine subsystems asssessments; experimental extinguishing system design configuration(s), fabrication and evaluation of concepts; breadboard system design; preliminary performance benefit/cost assessment; and a optional task to conduct materials fire testing and the evaluation of the breadboard system using a small-scale engine nacelle fire simulator as an abridging effort to Phase II.

Efforts have been underway by the chemical industry and various government agencies for the development of suitable alternative 'chemically' acting agents. Thus far, candidates offer significantly reduced effectiveness (average +75% weight penalty), higher cost and ill-defined toxicologic properties. This Phase I program focuses on the development of 'physically' acting fire extinguishing materials which can replace Halons 1301 and 1211 for fire zone applications and Halon 1211 for the on-board first-aid fire extinguisher application. The Phase I program includes: inert gas generation materials and techniques; formulation of non-acqueous foam agents; and comparative performance analysis versus the standard Halons. A final report will document all activities and summarize near-term advanced development and future commercialization opportunities.

        "abstract": "The minimization of noise is of primary importance in optimizing system performance. Active noise cancellation is one of the most promising concepts for achieving noise reduction. This cancellation is generally obtained by means of some type of an adaptive filter. The key component of such a filter is the search algorithm (typically least meansquared) by means of which the filter adapts its coefficients to produce the desired \"antinoise\". Rapid convergence, combined with stability and realistic system simulation, are the most important performance characteristics for the algorithm. AI Signal Research proposes to develop a new advanced filtering technique for active noise cancellation. The proposed active noise controlled system will utilize our proven high-performance Recursive Least Square (RLS) and fractional calculus adaptive filtering techniques to provide accurate prediction of the desired \"antinoise\" to achieve noise cancellation through an active secondary source. The ultimate effectiveness of this system will be attributed to its fast convergent ability to optimally adjust its filter characteristic for signal prediction. This high-performance adaptive filtering technology, proven in the SSME program for signal enhancement and noise cancellation for engine diagnostics, has a wide range of industrial application and can be placed into a commercial product to service US industry.",

If Nd mesh, having the proper structure and wire dimensions, can be fabricated, then much better performance can be expected. In a single-stage cryoccoler, the minimum temperature will be lowered below 20K, making the refrigerator very useful for devices using the new ceramic high temperature superconductors.

        "abstract": "The advanced materials and sophisticated designs of metal matrix composite components are being used in modern aircraft designs. To detect flaws and other integrity-reducing anomalies in these new materials and to assure the component reliability and accurate failure rate predictions, nondestructive evaluation (NDE) using X-ray inspection is becoming indispensable. Currently used X-ray imaging sensors primarily limit both the ability of radiographic and computed tomographic (CT) procedures to produce high quality images and also scan times adequate to achieve real-time inspection throughput. Using conventional X-ray sensors, such as Tb2O3 scintillators, there exists a problematic tradeoff between the thickness and spatial resolution due to laternal light spreading. The scanning speed of these systems is further limited by persistence effects of the sensor. To address these needs, we propose to develop a novel, large area, microstructured scintillator plate to be incorporated into a CT/radiography imaging system based on a large area charge-coupled device currently used for NDE of aerospace components. This microstructured X-ray sensor suppresses lateral spreading of the scintillation light even when the structure is made very thick. For the X-ray sources typically used in nondestructive testing procedures, this sensor will provide high resolution with high detection efficiency together with fast scanning speed, allowing the full potential of NDE systems to be realized.

        "abstract": "Space optical communications techniques are expected to be of great value when communicating at planetary distances. As opposed to RF systems, the high optical power concentration resulting from the small beam divergence will allow smaller diameter telescopes, less power and jam resistant communications. For deep space communications, the low optical level available for detection at the spacecraft presents challenging requirements in order to track the optical source position with extremely high accuracy. Current detection techniques do not have sufficient sensitivity at very low light levels encountered in these applications. This proposal presents a new high resolution, two-dimensional silicon avalanche photodiode focal plane array, with an internal gain higher than 108, fast time response and virtually without dead space between the sensing pixels. Phase I is designed to demonstrate the feasibility of producing high gain pixilated avalanche photodiodes by using integrated circuit planar technology. The detector is intended to be used as a acquisition/tracking detector at very low optical levels with applications in space optical communications.",

        "abstract": "Environmental monitoring of possible contamination by radioactive materials has created a need for portable measurement systems that can assay low-grade radioactive materials in waste and in process equipment. Currently available instruments for environmental radiation monitoring are either of poor spectrum resolution (NaI detector) or of limited portability (HP Ge). HP Ge detectors require large size cryogenic cooling and high voltage power supplies for operation, making the instruments bulky and cumbersome. In this proposal, we plan to fabricate lead iodide (PbI2) detectors for use in portable, lightweight radiation detection instruments for environmental monitoring and field application. PbI2, with its wide bandgap (2.5eV) and high Z elements (Pb=82, I=53) has ideal material characteristics. It makes possible radiation detectors that are small, sensitive, have good optical response, and operate at room temperature and higher temperature with bias voltages of a few or tens of volts. We have developed special techniques to prepare high quality crystals and to fabricate high performance X-ray and gamma-ray detectors consistently. Initial testing indicates that PbI2 detectors are sensitive to a wide range of radioactive sources, making them suitable for integration in instruments used in a variety of applications. Anticipated Benefits: PbI2 detector has the potential use for environmental monitoring and field measurements for radiation protection, nuclear materials control and waste management, nuclear arms regulation, X-ray astronomy for space exploration, X-ray fluorescense analysis. It has the potential to replace NaI scintillation and Ge radiation detectors in portable nuclear instruments. PbI2 may be a major breakthrough in high temperature detection of nuclear radiation.",

Current therapy, thetransfusion of human whole blood components, is effective, but it is not prophylactic or free of risk.Our long term objective is the development of a somatic cell gene therapy for hemophilia B. Autologouscapillary endothelial cells from adipose tissue of a hemophilia B patient will be isolated, transduced withthe factor IX gene using a replication-incompetent retrovirus, and grown in a 3-dimensional (3-D)collagen matrix for implantation into the same patient. Capillary endothelial cells in 3-D matrices formtube-like structures that are anticipated to anastomose with the patient's vasculature and becomeperfused with blood when implanted in the patient. In this way, factor IX will be chronically secreteddirectly into the patient's blood, alleviating the clinical manifestations of hemophilia B. In Phase I animalmodels will be used to determine the feasibility of this therapeutic approach. Rat and mouse capillaryendothelial cells (RCEC and MCEC) will be isolated and transduced with retroviruses that encode humangrowth hormone (hGH), human apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and human factor IX. RCECs, transduced withhGH and packaged into 3-D matrices, will be implanted to determine whether anastomosis occurs andwhether hGH will be secreted and detectable in the plasma. MCECs, transduced with ApoE, andpackaged into 3-D matrices, will be implanted in ApoE-deficient mice. Secreted recombinant ApoE fromimplanted MCECs is expected to cause a decrease in the high serum cholesterol in these mice and delayatherogenesis, indicating that therapeutic benefit can result from this approach. Finally, capillaryendothelial cells will be isolated from human adipose tissue, transduced with factor IX, and packagedinto 3-D matrices. Factor IX production by these cells, together with the animal studies, willdemonstrate the feasibility of this therapy in humans.",

These innovations are compatible with advanced packaging technologies, implementing a full instrument within the confines of a traditional instrument head. The objectives of this program are to establish feasibility and resources for a CEM-based instrument employing advanced electronic components and circuit engineering to minimize the most critical spacecraft resources: mass and power. Mass, power and volume are directly reduced through advanced components and circuit topologies. In addition, cost and schedule are reduced by minimizing instrument complexity while implementing electronics common to many CEM applications. The proposed effort will develop and evaluate CEM instrument electronics to minimize resources without sacrificing reliability or performance.

        "abstract": "AMAIN Electronics has recently patented an entirely new focal-plane method which directly digitizes the photo-response at each pixel within a monolithic or hybrid focal-plane. This technology is broadly applicable, and offers an opportunity to significantly advance sensor technology across the spectrum from visible to VLWIR, and in a very wide range of military, space, commercial, and evern consumer applciations. Direct digital readout eliminates need for separate analog processing, including wide dynamic range A/D conversion at video rates. In space and military sensors, elimination of the analog processor will generally achieve significant power, weight, and size reduction. The invention therefore supports two of the trends in space sensor development for the next century--utilization of large two-dimensional focal-planes in staring sensors, and reduction of the complexity, power, size, weight, and ultimately the cost of such systems through the so-called \"smallsat\" or \"lightsat\" approach.",

Fracture and delamination through acoustic wave measurements. The piezo fiber sensor will provide a way to measure strain at discrete points in the structure without excessive wire cluttering. The piezo sensor does not require additional inboard instruments for generation and control of input signals. Since the sensor will have a metal wire base, the fracture problems associated with fiber optics and piezoelectric sheets will be significantly reduced. The sensor will be electrically isolated from the host material to eliminate interference and cross talk.

In one approach, bellows design improvements are the result of combining the excellent dead volume avoidance characteristics of welded bellows with the structural characteristics of formed bellows. Formed bellows avoid both the high strees concentration values and the large amount of uncertainty regarding these values by eliminating the need for circumferential welds. In the proposed design, circumferential welds are not used avoiding or minimizing fatigue problems which have caused failures whenever bellows-driven crycoolers have been tried. This combination of design improvements provides a Quasi-Weld-Free Bellows. The other approach being evaluated involves a material that shows promise of demonstrating greater resistance to the formation of fatigue cracks. This material is called nanocrystalline nickel or nickel alloy. A bellows can be made of this material by electro-forming processes.",

Several authors have defined a subset of EMDtermed pseudo-EMD. This has been defined as the presence of cardiac contractile function withoutpalpable peripheral pulses. Some authors have suggested that patients in pseudo-EMD are more easilyresuscitated than patients in true EMD. Currently, an inexpensive, portable, minimally invasive deviceto detect pseudo-EMD does not exist. Our preliminary studies using a Doppler flat flow probe taped toa esophageal tube demonstrated the consistent detection of pseudo-EMD. This study will construct aPETE-Doppler (Portable Emergency Trans Esophageal Doppler) device. We will assemble, test andevaluate this prototype on fully instrumental dogs, with respect to its accuracy in the detection ofpseudo-EMD model. This canine model currently involves a short period of pseudo-EMD. Post-mortemexamination of the esophagus will be performed to detect any traumatic damage caused by the deviceduring cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The long term objective of this research is to provide anaffordable, portable, minimally invasive instrument that will be useful in rapidly identifying patients inpseudo-EMD.",

        "abstract": "The proposed innovation would do for the tip vortex what the turning vanes do at the inlet to gas turbine combustors, namely reduce the swirl. The intent of this proposal is to study the feasibility of the haney Swirler which consists of a set of vanes at the trailing edge of a downward curved tip, specifically a Sargent type tip. The standard wing tip would be modified to turn the outward flow downward and also to direct the remaining horizontal flow that is still swirling to the Haney Swirler vanes. The vanes would then reduce the tangential velocity of the swirling flow and increase its down stream velocity, resulting in a significant reduction in induced drag. The tips would be designed and models would be built for test in a wind tunnel. To facilitate comparison, we propose a four part test program. First, test a wing with a normal tip. Second, test a wing with a commercial winglet. Third, test a wing using a Sargent tip, and the fourth, testa wing with the Haney Swirler tip configuraiton. The tests would be conducted in the University of Toledo wind tunnel which has developed equipment and techniques to study vortex flow in conjunction with the NASA Langely Research Center. The data will be analyzed and a report will be published.",

Our approach is to use a low pressure, high temperature (2000 C) furnace with a temperature gradient between the A1N charge and the deposition (seed) regions. Our approach is based on several innovations. These include the use of single precursor synthesized A1N powders that we feel will avoid carbon and oxygen contamination. Our reactor design is unique and has the flexibility of moving the charge or the seed to the high or the low temperature zones. This flexibility is based on one of our proprietary furnace designs. The crystallization approach we propose is a modified Bridgeman technique. The seeding initiates on the tip of a conical zone. In our future Phase II program, with the availability of flat single crystal substrates this design will be modified. Dr. Glen Slack currently at G.E. Research and Development Center will serve as a consultant on the project. He has the distinction of producing the only known bulk A1N single crystal using A1N powder. We feel that his association coupled with our unique A1N powder chemistry and the furnace design will enable us in demonstrating the feasibility of our approach in the Phase I program. Anticipated Benefits: A1N and A1GaN based UV detectors for flame safeguard systems. A1N and A1GaN based UV light emitters for opticalrecording and storage.",

Thetherapeutic potential of marine natural products has rapidly advanced in recent years. One suchpotential therapeutic is bryostatin I which is derived from the marine bryozoan Bugula neritana. Whileharvesting the bryozoan with consistent sources of the active agent will become a significant portionof the supply problem, large-scale manufacturing of the natural product agent will also pose significantchallenges to processing logistics and manufacturing costs. Our specific aim is to investigate theapplication of supercritical fluid extraction and chromatography for the isolation and purification ofbryostatin I since these techniques have shown promise for the large scale manufacturing of certainanti-cancer agents such as taxol from terrestrial biomass sources. In this effort, we plan to collaboratewith CalBioMarine who will supply both naturally occurring and aquacultured quantities of B. neritina.This investigation should lead to the establishment of improved manufacturing processes for producinglarge quantities of marine natural product agents needed for preclinical and clinical development.",

Thesemethodologies have the potential of high sensitivity, since time-resolved fluorometry permits detectionof signal in the virtual absence of background fluorescence. Therefore, high intensity light can be usedto excite the fluorescence. Established techniques and literature indicate that for other applications thistype of approach is at least as sensitive as other methods, including radioisotopic or chemiluminescence--based or enzyme-based methods. This approach would have the advantage of speed, since aphotographic or electronic imaging record of the results can be obtained essentially instantaneously.",

Animals were directly inoculatedwith DNA containing the HIV-1 gp160 gene, resulting in humoral and cellular immunity to the HIVgp160. More recent work has demonstrated protection from a normally lethal cell challenge with amurine myeloma expressing gp160. For the present application, various plasmids will be constructed,used alone or modified for inoculation, that will induce an immune response directed against either SIVor HIV-1 gene products. Plasmids will be modeled after the one used in the successful gp160 HIVexperiments; however, the genes for many of the SIV and HIV proteins will be incorporated into theplasmids. Construction will be accomplished using standard recombinant DNA cloning techniques.Several of the HIV constructs or modified constructs will be designed to be safely compatible withhuman inoculation in anticipation of their use in human clinical trials. The immediate objectives of thisPhase I study will be (i) construction of the plasmids, (ii) evaluation of the levels of protein expressionin human rhabdomyosarcoma and murine myeloma cells that have been transfected with the constructsof interest, and (iii) evaluation of immunogenicity using mice and guinea pigs to provide a logical basisfor the selection of plasmids for further development as components of a genetic vaccine for HIV-1(GENEVAX-HIV).

The FORGE 90 programming environment is recognized as the most powerful parallel programming facility commercially available. FORGE 90 is the only such system that can translate an existing serial program for distributed memory parallel computers. The developers of FORGE 90 recognize that the major limitation of the FORGE 90 system is its inability to handle irregular problems. We have identified several pertinent research projects conducted at NASA/Langley's ICASE which suggest runtime analysis tools that can examine a programs data distribution and establish a communication pattern for transferring the data between the processors.

THE RESEARCH INVESTIGATES AN INNOVATIVE METHOD FOR DETERMINING WINDSPEEDS AND SPATIAL VARIATION OF WINDSPEEDS FOR EXTENSIVE PRESSURE SYSTEMS (EPS) USING A FIRST PRINCIPLE DIRECT ANALYSIS APPROACH.  THE METHODOLOGY MAKES USE OF THE RECENTLY AVAILABLE, AND INEXPENSIVE, DATA SET OF HISTORICAL RECORDS OF SURFACE PRESSURES FOR THE CONTIGUOUS UNITED STATES.  USING THIS DATA, THE PRESSURE FIELD CAN BE RECONSTRUCTED ON AN HOUR-BY-HOUR BASIS.  USING THE RECONSTRUCTED PRESSURE FIELD, A CONTINUOUS RECORD OF WINDSPEED AND DIRECTION AT GRADIENT HEIGHT CAN BE GENERATED AT ANY ONE LOCATION OR MULTIPLE LOCATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES.  THIS APPROACH ELIMINATES THE PROBLEMS WHICH PLAGUE SURFACE-LEVEL MEASUREMENTS AND PROVIDES A MEANS TO ESTIMATE AREAWIDE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE PASSING OF INTENSE, LARGE-SCALE, LOW PRESSURE SYSTEMS.  THE INVESTIGATION EXAMINES THE FEASIBILITY OF THE METHODOLOGY AND COMPARES THE RESULTS OBTAINED WITH THOSE OF TRADITIONAL METHODS.",

        "abstract": "Millimeter-wave circuit design requires accurate models to optimize performance, to minimize the number of preliminary designs, and to allow design centering for uniformity and high yield reducing cost and improving reliability. Existing bipolar circuit models fail at prediction of high frequency, non-linear, and switching behaviors. These models are not specified by the physical structure of the device and so are difficult to integrate with process simulators. Numerical device simulators are unable to yield results in reasonable execution times for high frequency waveforms and for large circuits. We propose to commercialize the Morris/Trew (MT) model for the bipolar transistor and heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) that: - Uses the physical material and structure for its parameters. - Provides accurate results with a minimum number of parameters. - Treats charge propagation explicitly through device (non-quasi-static) to provide large-signal accuracy to 100 GHz. - Consists of regional modules with analtic solutions. - Provides for strongly non-linear operation with few approximations. - Predicts the behavior of HBTs over temperature. This model will be linkable using compiled model facilities to commercial simulators. This will provide state-of-art modeling capability to the widest possible user community. Anticipated Benefits: The MT model will yield more accurate simulators at high frequencies and for stronly nonlinear circuits. The rapid execution will increase designer productivity and speed products to market. Optimization of device performance in the circuit enviroment will provide performance and yield improvements with fewer design interations. All of these will contribute to the commercial viability of HBT technology for wireless communication and high-speed digital circuits.",

The primary obstacle in buried metallization in PD or producing multilayer metallized PD is the difficulty in generating good bonding between PD and selected metals, especially copper. It is proposed to develop the requisite technology using a combination of state-of-the-art methods for CVD diamond growth and ion processing. The enabling technology to be demonstrated in the Phase I research is the ability to create good adhesion between metal layers and PD, and the ability to nucleate and grow diamond over metallized PD. Well-bonded metal layers on the PD surface will be achieved using a combination of a substrate-biased diamond deposition technique, ion enhanced deposition, and multilayer metals including carbide formers. Deposition of diamond on metallized PD will be achieved by using similar combinations.",

        "abstract": "Epitaxial growth of the aluminum gallium nitride (AlGaN) material system by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) has been hindered by the lack of a suitable nitrogen source. The deposition of AlGaN at typical MBE growth temperatures results in nitrogen deficient films that suffer from low growth rates and high n-type background carrier concentrations. This problem has recently been addressed in MBE by increasing the reactivity of nitrogen containing precursors by creating plasmas or ion beams. Some success has been achieved using nitrogen containing plasmas generated by electron cyclotron resonance (ECR), although routine production of device quality material has yet to be realized and growth rates remain low (0.1 - 0.2 microns/hr) due to insufficient fluxes of the nitrogen species. We propose a new nitrogen source for MBE based on the efficient photolysis of ammonia (NH (sub 3)) by 193 nm excimer laser irradiation. The photogenerated NH (sub 2) radicals, chemically reactive and possessing higher sticking coefficients, should enhance nitrogen incorporation, increase growth rates, and allow lower growth temperatures in the deposition of nitride based films. The principal investigators have collaborated at North Carolina State University in the growth of silicon and III-V semiconductors. We will use our extensive experience in the areas of metalorganic molecular beam epitaxy (MOMBE) and laser assisted chemical vapor deposition (LCVD) to develop an effective nitrogen source for MBE.",

This technique provides a substantial savings in data acquisition time that can be used to increase the scan rate and to improve the spatial resolution (i.e. reduce the footprint) of the measurements. This will provide a more accurate rain measurement because of increased filling of the antenna beam and will also enable measurements of rainfall closer to the ground. The objective of the project is to generate several optimal designs which meet different sensing requirements, and to compare the designs with that for the Precipitation Radar of the planned Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM). A prototype sensor is to be constructed during Phase II of the project for testing on a high-altitude aircraft above storms.

To develop and demonstrate the process, a fully automated and controlled laboratory PSA pilot plant will be built. Fundamental properties of the adsorbents, applicable for the O2/N2 and O2/Ar separations, will be investigated. The separation process will be tested and optimized at a wide range of operating parameters and conditions and a variety of cycles will be investigated to ensure optimal performance. Development of a theory of PSA processes for the production of 99% oxygen will provide the foundation necessary to create oxygen generators in various sizes and configurations.

        "abstract": "THE SOLAR CELL APPLICATION OF CRYSTALLINE SILICON THIN-FILM, PHOTOCOLTAIC (PV) TECHNOLOGIES IS CURRENTLY LIMITED BY THE HIGH COST OF THE SILICON RAW MATERIAL.  THIS IS A RESULT OF THE CARBOTHERMAL REDUCTION METALLURGICAL PROCESS USED TO CREATE THE SEMICONDUCTOR-GRADE SILICON FROM SILICA.  THERE IS A NOVEL ALTERNATIVE ORGANOSILICON CHEMISTRY, BASED ON ALKALINE GLYCOLIC DIGESTION OF SILICA, THAT DOES NOT INVOLVE THE ENERGY-INTENSIVE, COSTLY CARBOTHERMAL REDUCTION.  THE PHASE I PROJECT INVESTIGAGTES THE FEASBILITY OF THIS CHEMISTRY TO CREATE A HIGH PURITY SILICON RAW MATERIAL BY IDENTIFIYING APPROPRIATE NUCLEOPHILES TO EFFECT A ONE- OR TWO-STEP REDUCTION OF THE GLYCOLIC DIGESTION PRODUCT, AND BY IDENTIFYING PURIFICATION OPERATIONS ON PRECURSOR INTERMEDIATES.  THIS PHASE CONCLUDES WITH A FEASIBILITY AND ECONOMICS STUDY FOR A PILOT-PLANT FACILITY.   THE COST OF SILICON SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS IS LARGELY AFFECTED BY THE COST OF THE SILICON RAW MATERIAL.  IF THE SILICON RAW MATERIAL CAN BE REDUCED FROM ITS CURRENT LEVEL OF $10 TO $15 PER KILOGRAM (BASED ON SCRAP SILICON FALL-OUT FROM THE ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY) TO $1 TO $2 PER KILOGRAM, A $3 PER PEAK WATT SOLAR CELL WOULD ACCORDINGLY DROP IN COST TO LESS THAN $1 PER PEAK WATT.  AS THE CRYSTALLINE SILICON SOLAR CELL INDUSTRY GROWS INTO THE 10'S OF MEGAWATTS, THE DEMAND WILL EXCEED THE SUPPLY AVAILABLE FROM THE ELECTRONIC INDUSTRY, AND THE PRICE FOR THE SILICON RAW MATERIAL WILL INCREASE SUBSTANTIALLY.  FURTHERMORE, AS THE PV INDUSTRY REACHES 1 GIGAWATT BY THE YEAR 2000, IT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN PURE SILICON FALL-OUT FROM THE ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY, WHOSE TOTAL USE OF SILICON RAW MATERIAL WAS EQUIVALENT TO ONLY 120 MEGAWATTS IN 1992.

        "abstract": "AstroPower proposes to develop intense, mass-producible, low-cost 4 to 5 micron light-emitting diodes (LED's) using liquid-phase heteroepitaxy of lattice-matched InAsSb on GaSb substrates. The brightest visible LEDs (Ultrabrights) currently available are being produced commercially by the liquid phase heteroepitaxy process using materials with bandgaps in the appropriate visible range for the particular color desired and with matched lattice parameters. Liquid phase epitaxy has routinely provided quality LED and laser devices with the highest electrical-to-optical energy conversion efficiency. Furthermore, the optical design of the proposed IR LED is expected to be enhanced by special reflector and optical design considerations currently under development at AstroPower. This program will produce long life light sources of high solid-state quality -- quality not subject to the poor reliability and fragility of incandescent bulbs. Feasibility of this approach will be domonstrated by deliverable hardware by the end of the Phase I program.",

The ease of creating and updating the expert model ensures it will be current. Only information required by the user is presented - eliminating the intimidation of a multitude of large, overlapping databases and guidance documents that must be reviewed for each project.

Current DNA sequencing procedures almost universally require gelelectrophoresis of DNA fragments and are cumbersome and slow. SBH promises to produce rapidly largeamounts of sequence information due to the parallel nature of the analysis and is well suited forsequencing cDNAs or partial sequencing of amplified DNA to facilitate mapping. Enriched stable isotopeswill be utilized as labels for SBH to demonstrate the basic advantages of such labels and to show themultiplexing feasibility. We have demonstrated that stable isotopes function as both DNA andoligonucleotide labels and that resonance ionization spectroscopy can offer a very fast method for thedetection of surface-bound DNA. During Phase I we will be evaluating two potentially viable detectiontechniques for rapid sequencing and mapping using genosensor matrices: sputter-initiated resonanceionization spectroscopy (SIRIS) and laser atomization RIS (LARIS). Measurements will be made on nylonsurfaces, onto which DNAs have been attached, to identify positively hybridized and unhybridized sitesand to determine the sensitivity, efficiency, background, spatial resolution, and speed and theinterrelationships and trade-offs among them.",

SIRIMP IS BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF RESONANCE IONIZATION OF SPUTTERED ATOMS AND POTENTIALLY OFFERS SEVERAL ADVANTAGES OVER CONVENTIONAL HIGH-RESOLUTION ION MICROPROBE INSTRUMENTS.  THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE ARE THE HIGH SELECTIVITY, SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF ISOBARIC INTERFERENCES AND MATRIX EFFECTS, AND NOTABLE REDUCTION IN INSTRUMENT COST.  PRELIMINARY RESEARCH IS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO (1) ASSESS INTERFERENCES DUE TO UNSUPPRESSED IONS CREATED IN THE SPUTTERING PROCESS (SECONDARY IONS) AND THOSE CREATED BY NONRESONANT PHOTOIONIZATION AND EVALUATE METHODS FOR THEIR ELIMINATION, AND (2) EXPERIMENTALLY IDENTIFY AND EVALUATE RESONANT IONIZATION SCHEMES FOR PB AND U.  RESULTS FROM THE RESEARCH PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW STATE-OF-THE-ART ANALYTICAL METHODS WHICH WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY ADVANCE ANALYTICAL CAPABILITIES IN EARTH SCIENCES AND PROMOTE NEW AREAS OF RESEARCH.

The analysis relies on the theory of nonlineardynamical systems, or \"chaos theory\". It provides parameters (Lyapunov exponents, metric entropy,attractor dimensions) which cannot be derived from conventional reduction but which have already beenshown to have value in characterizing the larynx as a dynamical system. The technique is non-invasive,and the software will accept continuous speech and even some unrequested vocalizations, as fromneonates. The tool will be capable of detecting both unusual glottal periodicities and completeaperiodicity (chaos). There are both physiological and mathematical reasons to expect some distinctpathologies to excite distinct dynamical responses which the tool can distinguish. Phase I will verify thatthe tool can reliably determine the exponents and the attractor dimensions for entries in an existingdigital data base of vocalizations; show that the parameters identify distinct modes of stable vibration;and determine the extent to which the parameters vary with known laryngeal conditions. If successful,this software will provide a new set of clinical \"measurements\" for assisting in the diagnosis of laryngealpathologies. It can then provide objective corroboration for clinical judgments.",

        "abstract": "Safety-critical aerospace applications have become increasingly dependent on a software component. However, conventional approaches to increasing the software reliability of these systems have focused on purely programming aspects. While these methods can all lead to techniques which should minimize the number of flaws in the logic of programs, none claim to result in generation of code with zero errors. Recognition of the fact that systems for improved code reuse, code testing, or automated code generation will remain imperfect, has inspired the present innovative proposal for a hybrid hardware and software approach for improving software reliability. The Phase I effort is therefore aimed at researching how to create a hardware \"watchdog\" which is pre-programmed with characteristics of normal execution and flow of the program. Any deviations from normal program execution would be sensed and corrected by the new hardware device. This research is encouraged by preliminary results with similar approaches for improving the fault tolerance of machine controllers. Success with this proposed effort will anticipate demand by NASA and the aerospace industry for improved reliability of critical systems. It will also lead to creation, in Phase II, of a product for the commercial market which provides both soft and hard fault tolerance in the software running on personal computers.",

        "abstract": "The objective of the proposed program is to develop a widefield narrowband optical filter (WNOF) for use in laser radar receivers. The WNOF provides the necessary discrimination against strong solar bandground that limits the daytime performance of the laser radar system. The proposed approach is based on a new design of field widened birefringent filter. Preliminary analysis shows the following performance goals can met: bandwidth = 0.5A, field of view = +/- 7.5 degrees, optical aperature = 6.5 cm, tranmission = 20 percent, and can be designed to match a selected laser wavelength anywhere in the green wavelength region (510 - 550 nm). A number of critical issues for the proposed approach are identified. These include the need of fine tuning for compensating thermal effect and fabrication errors, reduced optical transmission due to fresnel loss, polarizers and additional loss from electro-optic elements. A risk reduction effort is proposed in Phase I that includes these tasks: (a) analyze proposed WNOF design and method of tuning, (b) investigate the issues associated with production of the filters and (c) development of a single stage prototype for demonstration of the tuning of the filter.",

This has proved difficult on existing manned aircraft such as the ER-2, necessitating post-processing of the data prior to interpretation. Digital flight control systems offer the possibility to receive signals from onboard scientific payload instruments and use them to fly a trajectory of specific scientific interest such as constant potential temperature, maximum cloud particle density, or maximum chemical species gradient. Unmanned aircraft are particularly attractive platforms for conducting these experiments since they are highly maneuverable, already set up to operate off computer-driven systems, and involve no risk to human life onboard. The innovation proposed herein is the first fully automatic flight control system that integrates data from scientific payloads with aircraft state variables to provide flight guidance commands based on specific scientific needs. During Phase I several control algorithms will be investigated and simulated. During Phase II one or more algorithms would be fully developed and demonstrated in flight aboard an unmanned aircraft.",

The approach is enabled by this company's recent development of cadmium zinc telluride detectors and the availability of readout technologies developed under DOD programs. Potential features include: lineardynamic range up to at least 10(5); reduced patient X-ray exposure; virtual elimination of spatial resolution/sensitivity tradeoff (e.g., resolution of 20 1pm and 100% quantum efficiency); direct pulse readout allowing energy discrimination and dual energy imaging; directly digitized output to greatly facilitate electronic image enhancement, data management and rapid data transmission; and capability for portable, low-power medical imaging devices that provide for remote/field use and instantaneous transmission of images from remote locations. Primary Phase I goals are to demonstrate technical feasibility and ultimate clinical and economi viability of the approach, and to establish a foundation of essential information of which to build a Phase II program. To accomplish these goals, a distinguished group of expert advisors from the medical community, academia and industry has been assembled. Anticipated Benefits: Improved X-ray imaging will provide significant clinical benefits in early diagnosis and treatment of many diseases and trauma related dysfunctions, and should reduce medical costs.

        "abstract": "Although great strides have been taken to generate and render problem geometries using computer automated design packages, as well as advancements in the the development of computational electromagnetics codes to solve Maxwell's equations, the link between the two is still very weak. Practical geometries have complex geometric features, abrupt changes in electromagnetic constitutive parameters, and possibly attached discrete loads. Furthermore, Maxwell solvers have different basis functions, modeling capabilities, and modeling constraints that must be satisfied. Automated interfaces developed for other analyses such as thermal or structural modeling, are not well equipped to handle these issues. This activity will develop an automated maintainable expandable interface between BRL-CAD and four method of moments codes: Electromagnetic Surface Patch (ESP), Triangular Surface Patch (TSP/MoM) and two next generation method of moments codes, spatial decomposition (SD/MoM) and PARAMOM. BRL-CAD is an inexpensive high quality package produced and maintained by the Ballistic Research Laboratories. It is well documented, the source code is available, and a geometry interrogation toolkit is provided. The selected Maxwell solvers are available from universities or have been developed under government funding. An augmented EMCC benchmark problem set will serve as test cases. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - Several government funded electromagnetics initiatives are underway at one Of WPAFB and the other NASA. An automated mesh generation capability will nicely complement these activities. Powerful electromagnetiC3 design codes are now becoming available on workstations and can be used in the private sector to design microwave components, to design consumer appliances, and to assess electromagnetic health risks. The interface described in this program could be sold commercially to SUIDIDort all of these activities.",

Magnetic tape technology is generally used as the storage media for tactical reconnaissance sytems because it provides that data capacity required by modern Electro-Optical (EOO) sensors. Developmental tactical reconnaissance sytems (ATARS and EO LORPOS) use the same wide band digital tape recorder with represents a significant protion of the overall cost of the equipemtn suite. Even with significant evnironmental condisitoning, including heating, cooling, tape preconditioning and humidity restriction, the digital tape recorder is still one of the least reliable, yet critical components of a tactial EO reconnaissance system. Other media provide greater benefits in regards to size, weight,power, cost, reliability and operational performance. Autometric, Incorporated, Computing Devices International (CDI), and key expert consultants have joined to investigae advancements in commercial storage media and data processing to offer an innovation approach to solving the tactical reconnaissance recording dilemma.

The array elements feature a highly efficient class-c oscillator. During Phase I, Avoca Labs proposes to build a proof-of-concept five element array with a 28 GHz carrier for transmitting five, 18 MHz FM modulated video channels.

One method is to improve the efficiency of the motor controller. This may be accomplished by incorporating the latest component technologies into innovative circuit topologies. Axiom technology international proposes to design a MOS-Controlled Thyristor motor controller. Coupling this technology with a four quadrant motor controller which peforms regenration during vehicle braking efficiency. The approach will be proven out in Phase I by performing a preliminary design and defining the required experiments and proper testing strategy. Simulations will be run to predict performance. Based upon the results, Phase II will proceed with prototyping and integration into a test vehicle. The benefits are obvious, further vehicle travel distance from a single charge and longer life from the batteries based upon mileage. Anticipated Benefits: A high efficiency motor controller has wide spread use in many applications. They are especially applicable in areas like Magnetically levitated trains, electric trains, and subways, in addition to electric vehicles. The controller would be applicable in virtually any motor control application.",

We will build an automated system using a modifiedsyringe pump and a solid state injectate cooler to automatically measure cardiac output once everyminute. Recently introduced devices automate this measurement and provide continuous measurement,however, these devices require special catheters costing $195.00 per patient and require long averagingperiods (10 min.). Our system would achieve the same accuracy and real-time data using a standardcatheter costing $40.00 per patient. We have tested the technique in five animals and have found thesystem capable of making cardiac output measurements using only 2 ml injectate volumes. The smallvolume technique gave measurements with accuracy similar to those obtained using the standard of 10ml iced injectate over wide range of cardiac outputs.

Recent work on relay algorithms to detect faults and coordinate multiple circuit protection devices (CPDs) has demonstrated high-speed relay algorithms capable of reliably detecting transient events within several microseconds of their occurrence. These relay algorithms can be used with new switchgear being developed capable of switching power buses and feeders in several microseconds Ultra-high-speed relays need to distinguish accurately between normal and fault transients. The approach advocated is based on learning normal power system load transients and switching patterns as viewed from the perspective of the CPD. Dynamic polynomial neural network (DPNN) predictors will be used to model both normal and fault transients; their coefficient values, future forecasts, state phase-plan trajectories, and model error residuals can be used to distinguish normal from fault transients. The technique is adaptive and does not require substantial pre-training of the neural networks. Traditional prediction methods (e.g., reduced-order modeling) require computational throughput too excessive to be affordable for real-time implementation. Prediction using DPNNs can be done in real time using low-cost, off-the-shelf digital signal processing hardware.",

The assay is based on aninnovative amplification mechanism, the bacterial chain reaction (BCR), which is potentially capable oflowering the detection limit to one micrometastasis in 10 million bone marrow cells. The BCR utilizesliving cells of an autosyntrophic strain of Escherichia coil to amplify signals from reporter molecules, e.g.,enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibodies. Under the BCR conditions, reporter molecules trigger nearbyautosyntrophic cells to initiate a proliferative chain reaction resulting in discrete visible bacterial coloniesclustered around tumor cells. Phase I will optimize the BCR assay and assess its detection limits of usinga model system. For Phase II, the BCR assay will be validated by applying it to detection andenumeration of occult micrometastases in bone marrow specimens from patients with primary breastcancer.

To solve the problem, Beltran proposes to study combined techniques that include Magnetic Particle Technology and 3-D (Three Dimensional) Combined Magnetic Particle and 3-D Electrochemical Technology -- Combined Technology -- or CT). Of interest are processes that can reclaim the heavy metals for subsequent refining. The extent of development in Phase II will be sufficient to scale up to a small field test. The Phase I program will develop and prove the concept of using CT and/or MPRT in wastewater treatment. The prof of concept will include a safety and environmental impact study. The Phase II program will develop a prototype CT and/or magnetic particle resin technology which takes advantage of the negative charge present on colloidal impurities in sewage, effluent, and raw water. The theoretical treatment process may involve changing the ion charge on magnetite, contacting the effluent, inducing flocculation, clarifying, and release of the impurities from teh magnetite.",

The main focus of this program will bethe development of a single, representative chromatographic medium suitable for use in the process.This novel medium will be packed into a highly efficient column and used to resolve three pharmacologi-cally relevant drugs on a laboratory scale. This Phase I program has three objectives: 1) to demonstratethat the process is technical feasible, 2) to demonstrate that the process can resolve three racemic drugsto enantiomeric purity suitable for pharmaceutical use, and 3) to demonstrate that the process promisesto be economical.

Such biological materials should have characteristics that lead to multiple applications or multifunctionality. We propose to use the membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin (BR) in a highly ordered structural form to meet the above needs. Bacteriorhodopsin has unique optical functionality that is impossible to achieve using synthetic methods. Due to this functionality, BR has great potential to become a revolutionary optical material. However, BR has not been fabricated into materials in a way that would enable the realization of this potential. Thin BR films consist of a random distribution of BR patches with microscopic order; however, the lack of macroscopic order prevents such films from taking advantage of BR's potential in optical applications, which require that the BR patches be oriented. The ideal structural form would be multiple layers of the BR patches--each layer one molecule thick. This would lead to a material which would have a structure consisting of layers of two-dimensional crystalline patches--the most ordered three-dimensional structure possible for BR. We propose to fabricate BR films with this ideal structure to produce ideal BR-based films leading to a new class of optical materials that can be formed on a variety of surfaces.

        "abstract": "A new class of RO membrane is proposed that would exhibit unprecedented selectivity against organic compounds. Such membranes would be useful in water-recycle applications in space, as they would lead to exceedingly high water purity. As envisioned, the membranes would behave as \"barriers\" to organic molecules but still would allow water to pass. Two key innovations are required. The first is the use of \"plasma polymerization\" to produce a thin film of highly branched, tightly crosslinked material. The intermolecular spaces in these materials are such that water molecules are small enough to fit through, but moderately sized organic molecules such as phenol, benzene, urea, and ethanol are not. These materials have shown the potential of having selectivities greater than 10,000 for water over organic molecules, compared with maximum selectivities of 50 for conventional membrane materials. The second innovation is the use of a new membrane structure that eliminates problems with the inherent brittleness of the highly selective plasma-polymer material. In the Phase I program we will make these barrier membranes and then subject them to an organic \"challenge\" test to demonstrate that they are indeed barrier membranes. Work in Phase II would address fabrication scale-up and modularization of these membranes.",

This system, with a modified CCD video camera, a computer and a telemetry link would provide remote sensor data to damage control supervisors while enabling the supervisors to be in constant contact with on-scene personnel. In addition, the infrared vision system will provide on-scene personnel with enhanced visual capability in restricted visibility areas even if computer data is not available. A standard CCD video camera will be modified to be sensitive to signals present at infrared wavelengths. Coupled to the visor, this system will provide a heads-up type display while preserving full field of view vision. Through the addition of a small, dedicated microcomputer and telemetry system, a video overlay will provide large amounts of computer data to the wearer. An expandable spooled optical fiber link, trailed behind the wearer, allows supervisors to monitor a situation remotely via a video link. A two-way audio and data link with the wearer gives command and computer data access. A backup RF voice and data telemetry link would be provided.",

Recent advances in microprocessor design, operating systems, and programming code have enabled current personal computers to operate at speeds capable of supporting advanced man-in-the-loop simulation real time. A Phase I task is proposed to utilize these current technologies, along with the advanced user interfaces they allow, to demonstrate the potential of simulating a complex aircraft and flight cotrol system on a low-cost platform.

With suitable modifications, it can be adapted to collect VCTdata sets. In collaboration with NIST, BIR will design and apply the required modifications and thecollect VCT data sets for reconstruction into three dimensional density maps at BIR.

        "abstract": "We propose to develop the core high temperature superconductor SQUID technology enabling the implemenation of a new diagnostic system capable of non-invasively measuring heart function. SQUID technology provides the only known means to detect the very small magnetic fields generated by abnormal electrical activity in arrhythomogenic heart tissue. The application is to screen patients for cardiac arrhythmisas that can result in Sudden Cardiac Death. High temperature SQUID magnetometers are attractive because they would enable to cardiac diagnostic system to be built at a much lower cost, which is the key to commercialization. This proposal is geared toward: (1) determining the necessary sensitivity for a practical magnetometer chip to perform the cardiac applications, (2) identifying magnetometer designs capable of satisfying these requirements, and (3) fabricating and characterizing the most promising designs. All magnetometer chip designs will incorporate our state-of-the art high temperature superconducting junctions that combine sensitivity, manufacturability, and reliability. Anticipated Benefits: More than 300,000 people die each year from Sudden Cardiac Death in the United States. Thirty to forty percent of these people have no prior warning signs. In the US alone, a non-invasive cardiac screening test could save tens of thousands of lives and reduce health care costs by over $820 million per year. The same technology also has potential application in many key defense areas such as underwater mine detection, non-destructive evaluation of critical aircraft components, and ground-fault detection on VLSI circuits.",

The nutritional deficit in CF is associated with pancreatic insufficiencyand with the maldigestion of ingested fat. Pancreatic lipase supplements improve but frequently fail tocorrect the fat maldigestion. We have developed a novel, patented lipid-matrix composition(monoglycerides, fatty acids and lysophosphatidylcholine) which represents readily absorbable fatcalories.

RFPL's result from single base-pairdifferences within restriction enzyme recognition sequences which lead to fragments of variable length.Considerable population data has been assembled by \"Southern analysis', a laborious procedure requiringmicrograms of DNA and hybridization with labeled probes. We have devised an innovative methodologyfor rapid conversion of RFPLs into a PCR-based format allowing reliable, cost-effective genotyping ofindividuals on a large scale. We will develop RFPL genotyping kits for approximately 200loci distributedthroughout the human genome as well as kits for rapid sequencing of any RFPL. Phase I includes:location and sequencing of approximately 500bp DNA domains containing variable restriction sites inplasmid, phage and cosmid clones, conversion from Southern to PCR analysis, development of aprototype kit for genotyping 3 RFPLs in a multiplex assay and applying it to 1 individual from each of19 populations, and international field testing. The genotyping kits are intended for 4 major users: (1)laboratories in the Human Genome Diversity project, (2) geneticists performing linkage analysis ofcomplex disorders, (3) epidemiologists pursuing disease association studies with molecular markers and(4) forensic investigators solving identification and paternity cases.",

The Southern blotting technique, HPV-32, HPV-13 and HPV-6have been detected in oral mucosa in focal epithelial hyperplasia. Recently, detection of HPV in clinicalcervical samples was accomplished by the use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplificationtechnique. We describe an innovative strategy for screening oral cancer samples for the presence ofHPV DNA. By using general PCR primers which hybridize to the highly conserved L1 region of the HPVgene, all HPV subtypes can be amplified in a single PCR reaction. Samples which are judged positiveby this \"quick screen\" assay will be amplified using a different set of PCR L1 consensus primers and,by hybridizing replicate filters with DNA probes of various HPV subtypes, the subtype will be determined.By this technique, both the presence of HPV sequences and the specific HPV subtype in clinical oralcancer specimens can be determined.",

Many otherundefined oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes may also play a role in breast cancer development.We propose to detect somatic genetic alterations in breast cancer and breast metastases through thetechnique of PCR-based DNA fingerprinting. In this procedure, a single primer with an arbitrarilydetermined sequence is used to produce \"fingerprints\" of DNAs from normal and breast tumor andmetastases from the same donor. Since DNA sequences are often lost and/or amplified in tumor cells,the fingerprints of breast tumors and metastases should have different band(s) when compared to thefingerprints of the corresponding normal tissue of the same individual. Somatic genetic alterations suchas losses of heterozygosity and chromosomal gains, two alterations frequently involved in thedevelopment of aneuploidy of cancer cells, can be detected by this very powerful technique.",

        "abstract": "Despite technological advanced in battlefield management information systems, it is still difficult to assess the medical/physiological status of individual field personnel. This information is key to the effective utilization of medical resources, and the management of overall responses to battlefield injuries. A system that would provide the capability for pinpointing the location of injured personnel, and assessing their physiologic and diagnositc status, would allow medical personnel to dispatch injured personnel quickly and appropriately. The purpose of the proposed project is to develop and physiological sensors that would form the heart of such as system. The proposed system would provide a means to immediately transfer people with serious injuries to facilities that are best equipped to handle their condition. It would also provide a way to transfer people with less serious injuries to the appropriate facility based on the severity of their injury. In effect, such a system could actually provide a means for \"remote triage\", thus taking some of the burden of this task off field medical personnel who might be overburdened in critical times. Anticipated Benefits: The proposed project may have significant impact on older people who are functionally disabled and need help with activities of daily living. The increase in their numbers has caused considerable demand for home healthcare, and an increase in the number of people who are discharged from institutions with complex therapies like total parental nutrition, ventilator support, cardiac monitoring, etc. The proposed system could help ensure their safety and proper medical care.",

The 5' (non-priming) end of the primers utilized has an additional Tag sequence with isa source identifier of the donor/patient. Pools of PCR products from different sources are pooled forsubsequent analytical steps. A part of each pool of forty is put through the protocol for DirectSequencing (DS) of genomes of a few megabase complexity. Undegraded PCR fragments are sizemarkers added back to it. After a subsequent size fractionation, the presence of a PCR bandcorresponding in size to a genome segment of the pathogens is revealed by the high sensitivityMultiPhoton Detector (MPD) used to quantify PG and EC isotopes. MPD allows simultaneous butindividual quantitation of multiple co-resident EC and PG labels.

        "abstract": "Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) devices have shown some promise as specific gas detector/analyzers for a number of applications. These sensors operate as dual oscillators in which one SAW is coated with a sorbent material specific to c particular gas. The frequency of the coated oscillator changes with gas concentration while the uncoated reference oscillator does not. The difference between the frequency of the two oscillators is an indicator of gas concentration. Most previously developed SAW gas sensors have been limited to the measurement of a single specific gas species. Because it is difficult to isolate a sorbent material that is specific to a single gas species, interferences from other gas species will usually degrade instrument performance. This research project will investigate a different approach to SAW gas concentration measurement in which an array of four SAW delay line oscillators each coated with a different sorbent material will be used to create a series of frequency shift patterns for each gas species. These vapor patterns will be inputs to a pattern recognition software program in a microcomputer that will determine the chemical concentration of c whole range of gas species.

        "abstract": "An improved silver/zinc battery is a leading candidate for many applications requiring both high specific power and high specific energy. The silver and zinc electrodes offer important advantages over alternate electrode materials, such as equivalent weight and favorable kinetics. Silver/zinc batteries have seen application in systems such as torpedoes,satellites, underwater vehicles, aircraft,and missiles.However, more widespread use of this battery will be limited unless the combination specific energy can be increased. This work involves the development of a bipolar silver/zinc battery, with a specific energy which is substantially superior to the best primary silver/zinc batteries, but which is capable of delivering its energy through many charge/discharge cycles. The design of the battery centers on existing technology for high cycle life silver/zinc batteries, but also employs an efficient bipolar design, a lightweight thin, highly conductive bipolar electrode substrate, an efficient bipolar design, a lightweight, thin, highly conductive bipolar electrode substrate, an effective bipolar cell seal, and electrolyte modifcations designed to reduce the solubility of zinc. se: electrolyte modifications designed to reduce the solubility of zinc. The goal of this work is the demonstration of a ten cell bipolar battery, with a specific energy of > 399 W.hr/kg and which can be used through several deep cycles. The technology is adaptable to higher specific energy secondary batteries as well.",

A solid-state, thin-film version of this battery has been an area of research for several years and is proposed for development. The electrolyte used is based on polyethylene oxide, and is a conductor of Li+ ions. The cathode is a composite of lithium peroxide, polyethylene oxide, and carbon black. Preliminary experiments with this cell have shown that reversibility is possible. Thin-film cells built to this point have been capable of 40 charge/discharges cycles, and indications are that many more are achievable. Current densities of 0.1 mA/cm2 were sustained during these discharges. The measure open circuit potentials correspond with the 2.86 V theoretical value for the Li202/Li couple.

Refractive errors are a major public health issue, affecting the overwhelming majority of theAmerican population in the form of myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism and presbyopia. Previous attemptsto surgically correct these refractive errors have met with modest success. However, limitations inrecision, predictability and long-term stability of the previous procedures have significantly restricted theirpost-operative results. By using high-energy photons in the ultraviolet wavelengths to break chemicalbonds, and the diffraction-limited precision of coherent light sources (lasers) to tangentially ablatecorneal tissue, secularly reflective corneal stromal surfaces have been created. Through the use ofadvanced computer assisted optical design, annular aspheric prismatic optical elements will be fabricatedto create predictable, hemispheric domes of laser irradiation to ablate the cornea down to precise,ultra-smooth, spherical surfaces of pre-determined curvatures. The commercialization of the instrumentsand procedures to be developed is intended to permit the ophthalmic community to achieve clear,prosthesis-free, visual acuity for Americans.",

Fundamental device physics and practical processing limitations dictate that future SOI behavior, IV curves, subthreshold behavior, source-to-drain breakdown, and transconductance behavior.

RESEARCHERS HAVE DEVELOPED A CRYOGENIC CHILLED-MIRROR HYGROMETER CAPABLE OF EXTREMELY HIGH SENSITIVITY (BELOW ONE PPB) AND VERY FAST RESPONSE TIME (A FEW SECONDS).  IT IS ACCURATE AND SIMPLE TO OPERATE.  HOWEVER, TO BE FULLY USEFUL IN INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DEW/FROST POINT AND VAPOR PRESSURE (ENHANCEMENT FACTOR) MUST BE DEFINED FOR INDUSTRIAL GASES.  THIS INSTRUMENT PROVIDES DIRECT MEANS TO DETERMINE ENHANCEMENT FACTORS AT VERY LOW MOISTURE LEVELS IN A VARIETY OF GASES.  RESEARCHERS WILL TEST AND OPTIMIZE THE INSTRUMENT FOR USE AS A TRACE MOISTURE SENSOR IN INDUSTRIAL GASES, AS WELL AS MEASURE ENHANCEMENT FACTORS FOR GASES OTHER THAN AIR.  THIS WORK WILL MAKE POSSIBLE FAST, ACCURATE MEASUREMENTS OF TRACE WATER VAPOR IN INDUSTRIAL GASES AND THE ATMOSPHERE.",

To date, primarily manual procedures have been available to perform this operation. The objective of this program is an automated system for registering digital imagery and DFAD with DTED. The effort proposed here will use as a starting point a prototype of such a system that has resulted from collaboration between The Ohio State University and BW Technology. This prototype, operating on a Sparc workstation, employs lines extracted from DTED and from a grey-level image to register the two data sets. The process operates automatically after the user identifies windows in the data where common features appear to be present. In Phase I research will be performed to determine how to expand and enhance the methods used in the prototype (1) to accommodate DFAD and other types of imagery, (2) to improve the speed and robustness of the operation and (3) to more fully automate the process. Additional methods of feature extraction and utilization will be evaluated together with other procedures for feature matching and data registration.",

Because of the enormous variety of base sequences possible, the nucleicacids present a particular challenge. The goal of the proposed research is to design and build a devicethat can quickly detect a desired sequence of bases in minute quantities of nucleic acid fragments. Anovel biosensor will be constructed capable of determining when a DNA probe has correctly hybridizedto an oligonucleotide bound to the biosensor. The probe will be labeled with a fluorophore that reactsin the near infrared. The use of fiber optics to help form the biosensor will permit a small portion ofradiant energy to be refracted through the fiber core. This energy, known as an evanescent wave, willbe absorbed and cause emission from the fluorophore. An optical-fiber, laser-based Mach-Zehnderinterferometer, operating in the near-infrared region, will determine whether a phase shift has occurredbetween the laser beam in the test optical fiber compared to the same beam in a reference optical fiber.Optical shifts as small as 10-6 radians can be detected with this instrument configuration. Thebiosensor attached to the interferometer theoretically may be capable of detecting about 3 x 10-21 moleof analyte (molecular weight of 15,000 Daltons). The biosensor could also use ribosomal RNA (rRNA)to detect specific base sequences. rRNA sequences have already been used to determine phylogeneticrelationships among bacteria. The sensitivity of the proposed instrument may be sufficient to correctlyidentify a specific bacterial strain from the rRNA of just a single cell. The biosensor could also beimportant for DNA sequencing studies.",

Resultant stresses under unfavorable conditions, have caused losses of structure and human life. The main investigator developed IPSR (In Process Stress Relief)-Process that produces a weld joint without residual stresses or with low acceptable residual stress. Low frequency low stress cycles were applied during welding for a weld in A1 alloy 5058. It reduced residual stress by over 12,000 psi. In this proposal parameters specific to IPSR-process (Proposer's US Patent # 4,386,727) will be separated for selected alloys; The IPSR-Process will be a component of a Welding Power Source. The main investigator is a mechanical and metallurgical engineer, holds M.S. in welding, has six patents in related areas and is assisted by a metallurgical engineer and a Professor from UC, Davis CA. The process is pervasive in nature with strong commercialization indicators. Anticipated Benefits: Post-weld stress relieving operations will be rendered unneccessary, making dramatic savings in cost, time and capital investment.

One consideration inachieving success of these modern progestins is increasing the palatability of the dose form. In orderto address this, our team and others have investigated the long term delivery of the contraceptive froman implantable dose form. We previously found that a single dose of levonorgestrel, given in a smallcylindrical implant of a poly (lactic-co-glycolic) acid polymer was able to release therapeutically activelevels of levonorgestrel for periods of up to two years (as measured in vivo using rats). Two factors nowfavor the continuation of this work: (l) the FDA approval of a new oral contraceptive formulation basedon a modern generation of progestins, derived from levonorgestrel, which allow even lower doses thanprevious OC's, and (2) our development of a proprietary PLGA technology which facilitates FDAapproval, formulation manufacture, and sample integrity. Based on the advances in these two areas,i.e., the drug and the formulation technology, this project will couple these interests with the goal ofdeveloping an acceptable, long-acting fertility regulation dose form.",

        "abstract": "Defect-free crystals which exhibit optical non-linearities are of great interest. Recent development of polymers with large second and third order nonlinear effects has generated interest in the potential of polymeric non-linear optical materials (NLOM). The ideal NLOM would have a very large nonlinear response, extremely low switching thresholds and rapid switching times, as well as amenability to defect-free fabrication. Crystals grown in space have been shown to be of higher quality than \"earth-grown\" crystals because more defect-free specimens are obtained in the absence of gravity-fueled convection. Defect-free organic crystals are of particular interest because they can exhibit high optical non-linearities. However, as these are molecular crystals, they tend to be brittle and cannot be as easily fabricated into thin films or fibers as can polymer analogs. Little attention, however, has been paid to the growth of high-quality macromolecular polymeric films in space. Polymers having a controlled supermolecular structure and morphology could be even more promising candidates as NLOM. A previous NASA project projected the feasibility of processing biopolymers, materials with known supramolecular structure, in an electric field under microgravity conditions in order to optimize optical non-linearity. The proposed work will identify the particular importance of understanding polymer processing conditions, particularly with respect to electrode and cell design.",

The model projects thepopulation and simulates the behavior of the labor force and the growth of the economy, the operationsof the retirement income systems and health care expenditures, focusing on the effects of demographicand economic change. The model depicts the behavior and economic conditions of a large number ofdemographic groups and investigates the effects of population aging on the economy and on retirementincome systems and health care expenditures. It projects the economic resources and health care costsof the elderly. Phase I of the project investigates the economic resources of the elderly by analyzing twomicro-databases providing extensive information on the income and assets of households, the Surveyof Consumer Finances (SCF) and the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS). These databases will beanalyzed to study trends in the assets of the elderly and the interactions among retirement saving andlabor market experience. A simple micro-simulation model will be developed to age the SCF data topermit comparison of those data with the HRS data. To adjust the SCF data a model of household assetaccumulation will be developed and integrated with the Macroeconomic-Demographic Model. The newmodelling system and databases will provide the basis for policy research and analysis and consultingapplications for public and private sector organizations.",

This behavior is very complex and can result in parts with significant residual stress that may affect part removal, part fit-up, and overall performance. The objective of this program is to develop a CAD/CAM system that can be employed to define an optimized processing cycle and a tool design that will minimize process induced residual stresses in composite laminates. This is achieved by implementing a composite cure model that describes the component behavior during processing and through numerical iteration, defines a process cycle that results in minimal process induced stress. This information is then employed in designing a tool that matches the thermal expansion behavior of the composite laminate. Therefore, no thermo-mechanically induced stresses will be created in the composite during processing. The output of the CAD/CAM system will be an optimized processing cycle for the composite laminate and all the required design information to produce the matching tool.",

The proposed program is based on three CERCOM-funded efforts: (1) A feasibility demonstration that in situ-formed beta silicon nitride whisker-reinforced SiC composites can be produced; (2) A demonstration that new processing approaches can be used to produce a new type of monolithic SiC with segregated grain boundaries, and; (3) An on-going analytical evaluation of materials and processing parameters as a function of physical, mechanical and microstructural properties. Preliminary CERCOM studies with in situ-formed beta silicon nitride whisker-reinforced SiC composites have indicated that the flexure strength and fracture toughness increased from 517 MPa and 3.44 MPa.m 1/2 to 940 MPa and 6.24 MPa.m 1/2, respectively. The proposed program builds upon the CERCOM studies to define the materials and processing parameters required to achieve optimum acicular grain growth and aspect ratio and define the requirements for the control of the interface bonding between acicular grains and the second phase. R-curve studies will be performed on the new SiC composites. Preliminary thermomechanical testing will be performced for selected materials at 1000 and 1200oC. Anticipated Benefits: It is anticipated that combinations of materials and process parameters will be identified which will yield new, reliable, tough, high strength SiC composites which can be used for high temperature structural applications such as components for internal combustion engines, thermal management structures, and other structures for use in extreme environments.",

The optional phase of this project will consist of the production of simple test pieces by an industrial graphite composite structure manufacture to evaluate if further tool property modifications are required and to determine if this type of tooling is suitable for prototype and low-quantity production fabrication of graphite composite structures. Some of the advantages of CerCon's tooling is that it is relatively low-cost (< $100/ft2), it can be formulated to have a thermal expansion similar to that of graphite reinforced composite structures, it has a maximum use temperature of at least 400 degrees C and can have \"Teflon\" incorporated into its structure to promote its abrasion, chemical and release properties. In addition it is composed entirely of inert ceramic materials and common polymers and therefore does not create the environmental problems (organic vapors and hazardous disposal) associated with the resin based systems currently being used.",

An inert gas such as nitrogen will be expanded through a supersonic nozzle. Water will be injected and sheared by the high velocity gas to produce a finely atomized spray. In Phase I, the nozzle feasibility will be demonstrated. The ideal location of water injection (i.e. in subsonic, sonic, or supersonic region) and the aerodynamic shape of the nozzle will be resolved. Advanced 2-D and 3-D CFD aerodynamic shape of the nozzle will be resolved. Advanced 2-D and 3-D CFD analysis of the gas and liquid will be used to design at least two candidate nozzles. Brass prototypes will be fabricated and tested at Southwest Research Institute (SwRI). In Phase II, the nozzle will be optimized and incorporated into a turnkey flame suppression system which will be developed in collaboration with subcontractor Zallen International Associates (ZIA).

        "abstract": "THE USEFUL LIFE OF ENGINE OIL IS KNOWN TO BE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON FORMULATION AND THE ENGINE OPERATING MODE.  CONSEQUENTLY, AN OIL-CHANGE INTERVAL BASED ON MILES TRAVELED OR ENGINE OPERATING HOURS DOES NOT NECESSARILY DEFINE THE IN-SERVICE QUALITY OF THE OIL. ONE PROBLEM IN PARTICULAR FOR DIESEL ENGINES IS THAT OIL DISPERSANCY CAN FAIL VERY RAPIDLY.  THIS ENABLES THE SUSPENDED SOOT PARTICLES TO GEL THE OIL EVEN WHEN THE ACTUAL SUSPENDED SOOT PARTICLES ARE ONLY PRESENT AT A 1 PERCENT TO 2 PERCENT (W/V) CONCENTRATION.  THE RESULT OF GELLING IS INCREASED VISCOSITY, POOR COLD-START PROTECTION, MORE SOOT ABRASION WEAR, AND LOSS OF LUBRICITY.  DISPERSANCY OF AN OIL CAN BE LOST WHEN ALL OTHER OIL PROPERTIES, E.G., OXIDATIVE RESISTANCE, ARE STILL 90 PERCENT INTACT.  SOME ENGINE OPERATING SCHEDULES-NOTABLY HIGH-LOAD TO LOW-LOAD EXCURSIONS-CAN LEAD TO TOTAL DISPERSANCY LOSS IN LESS THAN 100 HOURS OF OPERATION.  THE RESEARCH IS DIRECTED AT USING SCATTERING OF INFRARED RADIATION AS A MEANS OF DETECTING THE TRANSITION FROM WELL-DISPERSED PARTICLES TO THE AGGLOMERATES THAT FORM AS DISPERSANCY FAILS.  THE WAVELENGTH SOURCE IS CHOSEN TO MATCH THE EFFECTIVE SCATTERING DIAMETER OF THE PARTICLES AND AGGLOMERATES IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE TRANSITION CAN BE DETECTED AS A DEVIATION FROM CLASSICAL RAYLEIGH SCATTERING BEHAVIOR.",

We will use our commercial grade toolkit for chaotic data analysis to see if chaos is present is some distributed systems. Our toolkit incorporates all the relevant methods for detecting and analyzing chaos. The remarkable aspect ofthese methods is that they operate directly on data. No prior knowledge or model of the system is required. We can directly determine the degrees-of-freedom (dimensionality) of the system and the rate of which information about system state is lost for all degress of freedom. Our collaborators at the Institute for Nonlinear Science, UCSD, invented many of the techniques, including local statistics. Local statistics examine how systems evolve in finite time (vice the entire data set). Local dimensions are important for real world prediction, control, and modeling. We also present several methods for controlling chaos. Anticipated Benefits: These methods may provide better ways of controlling large distributed computing environments, logistics networks, C4I networks, and transportation systems.",

        "abstract": "Computerized training systems must adapt to individual learning styles, as required within Socratic dialogues; the Socratic dialogue has been well recognized as an ideal on-to-one teaching methodology. This dialogue is such that specific questions are directed to the individual student, eventually guiding him or her to enlightenment on a particular subject. In this manner, the student not only would experience the thinking necessary to reconstruct the subject domain but also make the training software adapt to his/her learning style for maximal learning performance. Here, we propose to investigate the applicability of software learning agents to tutoring systems. A software agent is a program that runs in the background and performs user-assigned tasks autonomously. A learning agent observes user's actions or other events in the background, finds repetitive pattersns, automates them upon approval, and gets smarter with user or environment feedback over time. We believe that learning agents can dramatically improve computerized training systems. In particular, we propose to review learning styles and artificial intelligence methods for tutoring systems, to investigate the applicability of software agent technology to tutoring systems, and analyze feasibility on a selected vocational training example. Anticipated Benefits: The successful completion of our Phase I plans have provided the foundation for a Phase II effort involving the development of a software agent prototype for a vocational training system. The successful completion of our Phase II plans will enable a commercialization effort for Phase III to market the developed software agent to the Fortune 1000 market. Under a Phase III development effort, we will focus on the commercial product development, launching, and marketing.",

        "abstract": "We are proposing to develop Virtual Panoramic Vision Blocks (VPVB) to providing drivers of IVHS sensorized vehicles with a low cost means for gaining full driving situational awareness. This approach combines solid state sensors with advanced display technology and computing to implement an electronic view of the external world. Thus, the term \"virtual\" comes from the fact that data can be \"over larid\" over existing widows or viewing ports from within the vehicle. Under poor visibility conditions, the displayed information can be from IR or radar sensing systems, while under normal conditions the view can mix the actual outside view with computer generated overlays. For military applications, there need be no windows thus allowing for 100% armor. The term \"panoramic\" refers to a particular sensor configuration that utilizes multiple sensors arranged to cover a 360 degree field of view instead of costly and complex, inertially stabilized, gimbal-mounted sensors. Anticipated Benefits: Within both the military and commercial sectors, the same basic technology will support fusion of data from multiple sensors, overlay of vehicle status, and low-cost enhancement driver visual acuity. This technology can support low-data rate driving of autonomous fighting vehicles, totally enclosed and armored personnel compartments, enhanced viewing in commercial vehicles under adverse conditions, and fusion of vehicle map and status overlay with conventional through-the-windshield viewing.",

THE GENERATION OF UNDESIRABLE ASH FROM COAL-FIRED POWER PLANTS HAS BECOME A SERIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEM.  COAL-FIRED POWER PLANTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ANNUAL PRODUCTION OF MORE THAN SIXTY MILLION TONS OF ASH IN THE UNITES STATES.  A TYPICAL 800 MEGAWATT STATION CONSUMES 7500 TONS OF COAL AND GENERATES 1000 TONS OF BOTTOM AND FLY ASH DAILY.  ASH CONTAINS HEAVY METALS, AND THE DISPOSAL OF THIS MATERIAL IN LANDFILLS IS DRAWING INCREASED ATTENTION.  MUCH OF THIS ATTENTION IS WARRANTED BY THE FACT THAT ASH IS A FINELY DIVIDED OXIDE POWDER WITH A LARGE SURFACE AREA.  SINCE THE LEACHING OF A CONSTITUENT FROM A POWDER IS PROPORTIONAL TO ITS SURFACE AREA, IT WOULD BE DESIRABLE TO DESIGN A METHOD OF CONSOLIDATION INVOLVING SURFACE AREA REDUCTION.  THE INTEREST IN SUCH A TECHNIQUE WOULD BE GREATLY INCREASED IF, IN ADDITION TO VOLUME AND SURFACE AREA REDUCTION, THE PRODUCT HAD USEFULNESS AND COMMERCIAL VALUE.  FOR EXAMPLE, TILES OR BRICKS CAN BE FABRICATED, BUT CONVENTIONAL METHODS OF HEATING USED IN TILE MANUFACTURING REQUIRE LARGE FLOWS OF AIR WHICH CAN CAUSE AIR POLLUTION.  THEY ARE ALSO TIME AND ENERGY CONSUMING BEACUSE IT IS RELATIVELY DIFFICULT TO HEAT A POWDER.

HOWER, IF SOME DO NOT, SMALL AMOUNTS OF A MICROWAVE COUPLER SUCH AS FERROUS/FERRIC OXIDE MAY BE ADDED TO FORM A MICROWAVE COUPLING MIXTURE.  UPON HEATING, THE ASHES WILL SINTER AND UNDERGO A REDUCTION IN SURFACE AREA.  UNDER APPROPRIATE PROCESSING CONDITIONS, THIS WOULD RESULT IN (1) THE FORMATION OF A MECHANICALLY STRONG MATERIAL SHAPED AS A TILE OR BRICK, (2) ENCAPSULATION OF HEAVY METALS IN A VERY STABLE GLASSY PHASE, AND (3) ELIMINATION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE STARTING MATERIAL.",

        "abstract": "Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) is rapidly becoming a core technology for interactive training, system development and evaluation, and strategy/tactics evaluation. Future DIS applications need the ability to flexibly combine crewed simulators, instrumented live-fire system, and automated surrogate players. Current technology, however, is inadequate for generating surrogate playrs with the needed flexibility and realism. There is, therefore, a need for new technology with which to develop and simulate surrogate DIS players. The proposed research assesses the feasiblity of meeting this need through application of COGNET, a methdology and software technology intitially developed to construct autonomous agents in human-computer interfaces. COGNET is unique in its ability to model the real-time, multi-tasking aspects of human performance in tactical situations, and its ability to link state-of-the-art artificial intelligence technology for planning and problem solving with highly detailed modeling of vehavior. The Phase I research develops and analyzes a COGNET-based architecture for generating DIS surrogate players, and offers an option to develop a software design for a tool that implements this architecture in a Phase II effort.",

Previous studies, with a variety of modelsystems, have shown that B6B21 acts as a partial ago mst at the glycine site of the N-methyl-D-aspart-ate receptor (NMDAR). NMDAR play a central role in learning, memory loss due to aging andAlzheimer's disease, modulation of pain perception, and possibly schizophrenia. Glutamate excitotoxicity,mediated by overactive NMDAR, is one of the principal ways that neurons are damaged by stroke. Thelong-term goal of Neurotherapeutics, Inc. is to develop a memory enhancer by using B6B21 as atemplate to create peptides and/or mimetics that will be more efficacious than the original antibody, andcross the blood-brain barrier. This will be accomplished by cloning and sequencing the variable heavyregion of B6B21. This Phase I application proposes to test B6B21 in aged rabbits using thehippocampus-dependent, trace conditioning paradigm.

Two proprietary technologies have been developedwhich incorporate fluorescent nucleotide analogs into probes during enzymatic synthesis. Thetechnology relies upon the complete replacement at each occurrence of a specific nucleotide with itscorresponding fluorescent structural analog. This substituted oligonucleotides hybridize to theirrespective target sequences with the same specificity and reaction kinetics as the normal non-substitu-ted oligonucleotides. The fluorescent probes can be subsequently incorporated into diagnostic assaysfor infectious disease pathogens. Fluorescent nucleotide analogs have been chosen as the detectablelabel because their emission is stable over long periods, and the multiple substitutions provide a systemof label amplification, thereby enhancing sensitivity by several orders of magnitude over existingdiagnostic assays.",

Each of these innovations would provide the ability to control bandwidth based on the measuring conditions rather than have the bandwidth increase as the square of the wavelength as is presently the case in today's AOTF's and liquid crystal tunable filters.

        "abstract": "Software testing is one of the most problematic phases of software development. This stems from the inability to gain acceptable confidence that a piece of software will not fail after deployment. Mutation testing is one form of white-box software testing that holds promise in assuring that a piece of software does not contain faults after testing is complete. Mutation testing does this by mutating the source code and then finding test cases that are able to distinguish the original code from the mutated code. This creates a set of test cases that are termed as \"mutation adequate.\" These test cases are considered as having a greater ability to detect software faults and they are then used as the test inputs to the program. Unfortunately, mutation testing techniques have not been practical -- due to high performance costs. We propose to research these issues to prove the feasibility of developing a mutation testing tool for Ada software components. This work will yield a tool that provides NASA with software that should be less likely to contain faults after testing. This reduction in software faults will provide significant cost reductions associated with maintaining NASA software that has been tested using mutation testing.",

The interferometric approach is capable of highmeasuring accuracy, one order of magnitude above that of commercially available computer-assistedkeratoscopes. It also surmounts many of the difficulties encountered by existing systems whichreconstruct the corneal surface from images of keratoscopic mires, especially in the case of irregularcorneas, whether diseased or following corneal procedures. A laboratory prototype system will bedesigned and constructed, based on the use of polarization shearing interferometry, solid state CCDimaging and microcomputer technology. Software will be developed, using new digital phase measuringtechniques capable of real-time measurement with submicron accuracy over large arrays of data points.Graphical displays will include outputs such as wire-mesh views, color contour maps and meridionalprofiles. Laboratory testing of the prototype will include estimation of the measuring accuracy usingcalibrated steel balls. The approach will be also assessed in terms of reliability, reproducibility, ease ofuse and cost effectiveness.",

Diamond material addresses 4 of the 22 DOD and DOE identified critical technologies; improved microelectronics, passive sensors, high power microwaves and precision guidance. The proposal is a feasibility study of how the diamond can be grown. John Clay et. al invented a concept for designing a high pressure containment vessel which permits the growth of high purity, large diamond crystals. We seek to demonstrate \"proof of process\" by building and testing a containment vessel and growing 500 carat diamonds. The diamonds will be cut and marketed by the Diamond Cutting Center (DCC). Clay's and the DCC plan a joint venture to produce, cut and market diamonds. All work will be done in the U.S. After commercial operations are underway, they plan to obtain a large press which will grow diamond 150 mm in diameter, which are expected to supply the needs of the DOD and DOE. Anticipated Benefits: This technology development program is expected to enhance the US military's technical superiority in the areas of windows and optics. It will provide the substrate to build the next generation of IC chips. A new industry will be created with anticipated revenues of $30M per year. It will supply our diamond needs for jewelry which is currently $4B a year.",

        "abstract": "We propose an ELF airborne radar operating below 50 Hz that will detect acoustically quiet threat sumersibles at moderate depths in coastal/harbor waters. Bisatic as well as backscatter geometries are to be considered. The investigation will optimize nonsinusoidal signal waveforms for this problem. We have already developed and discuss in the proposal: (i) the latest theoretical tools for numerically predicting low-frequency radiation and propagation above and through sea water; (ii) the abiilty to digitally synthesize and process non-sinusoidal signals of any desired shape. By considering a typical example, we identify the two major limitations to the feasibility of such a system: external noise and clutter. \"Clutter\" refers to unwanted versions of the transit signal including direct feedthrough, surface reflections, and bottom reflections. Non-sinusoidal signal design can mitigate clutter problems. Signal-to-noise ration is improved by increasing the received echo enery; this is possible at the transmit end by more input power or more efficient antennas, while at the receive end it is accomplished by longer coherent integration via digital signal processing. Tradeoffs utilizing the numerical tools we have developed will arrive at the optimum system configuration along with performance bounds. Critical hardware and system elements are identified, and their implementation for this application will optimize their performance while minimizing size, weight, radiated power, complexity, and cost. This will lead to an overall assessment of system feasiblity.",

        "abstract": "This proposal addresses technical issues associated with the development of a large aperture, accurate, furlable, microwave antenna reflector. Our proposed innovation involves the use of a thin membrane of graphite fiber-reinforced epoxy (GFRE), cured into the desired parabolic surface for the microwave reflective surface. In the stowed (furled) configuration, this membrane is rolled to a compact package, then restrained. This compaction allows a large aperture reflector to be launched by current vehicles with limited payload volumes. Once the reflector is in the desired orbit, the restraint system is released and the membrane reflector unrolls on its own according to the as-cured parabolic shape. This innovation offers a combination of advantages which other options such as wrapped rib/mesh, umbrella mesh, and segmented pedals do not. The furlable concept offers the potential for excellent surface accuracy, making it suitable for high-frequency use. This concept is also electrically continuous, further enhancing its suitability, and has a simple mechanical design, requiring no complex mechanims, nor their associated reliability problems during deployment.",

Current surfactant preparationsare too viscous for aerosolization and must be delivered to the lung by intratracheal instillation of a large,potentially obstructive bolus which is poorly distributed. By capitalizing on our experience in liposomeproduction and characterization, we will convert an existing surfactant preparation into a submicrondispersion which can be aerosolized into 1-3 micromole droplets. In pilot experiments we have revealeda potential increase in drug efficacy coincident with an almost ten-fold reduction in drug cost. Quantityand distribution of labels incorporated into surfactant lipids in the aerosol will be followed in order todemonstrate more extensive deposition of such aerosols in the lung than that achieved with previoustechniques. Delivery, distribution and efficacy of the aerosolizable surfactant will be demonstrated usinga suit-depleted newborn piglet model. Delivery and distribution will be measured by whole body imagingof radiolabel, while efficacy will be monitored by improvements in blood gas values and in lungcompliance.",

The medium should possess high sensitivity, large dynamic range, and a reliable fixing mechanism. No single material to date safisfies all of these important criteria. We propose to overcome this limitation by applying novel post-growth processing treatments to further enhance the performance of two very promising material candidates, LiNbO3 ans SBN.

The array is based on successful experimental work at Cornell through Raytheon support. The design is based on a series of unit cell monolithic power amplifiers (pHEMT), isolated in such a way that they can be modeled and evaluated individually. During Phase I, we will design and simulate the amplifier array by developing software tools to accurately simulate the components of the quasi-optical system. Such a capability does not exist in any simulators and is considered to be an obstacle in exploring new ideas in this emerging field. During Phase II, we will utilize advanced GaAs technology to fabricate an amplifier array optimized by our commercially available nonlinear circuit simulator, Microwave Harmonica. Also we will develop simulation tools to enable modeling of grating patterns for instances of non-normal incident radiation. The successful outcome of this effort will result in demonstration of a novel high power quasi-optical amplifier array and CAD tools related to cost effective research and realization of quasi- optical components. Anticipated Benefits: The proposed amplifier arrays are most suited for fabrication by the existing monolithic technology. Hence, large volume production is possible with a significant reduction in manufacturing cost. The CAD enhancements resulting from this effort will also enable the quasi-optical community to perform cost effective research on quasi-optical components and systems.",

The innovative aspect of this proposed development is the design and implementation of an \"automated updating\" capability that, based on simple screen input from a user, will update the listings of reactants and reaction paths in the model photochemistry, regenerate the \"map\" associating reactants with reaction paths, and execute \"intermediate chemistry expression generators\" that in effect rewrite relevant sections of the photochemical code automatically. These \"generators\" are characteristic of the numerical technique used by the code in computing reactant abundances; in this proposal, we restrict our attention to the Newton-Raphson iterative convergence technique for obtaining steady-state abundances. Development of this environment with \"automated updating\" directly serves the subtopic need for the continual extension of current photochemical model capabilities while, on the one hand, adhering to operational standards and, on the other hand, making the code accessible to data analysts in support of NASA missions.",

The horizontal Bridgman technique is a primary process for growth of IR as well as opto-electronic quality GaAs crystals. Yet, our ability to quantitatively predict the influence of various growth and growth system parameters on the device-critical properties of the materials grown by this technique remains extremely limited. A team of three companies isformed to develop an HB computational simulator based on latest advances in process modelling and numerial techniques, and growth experiments focused on model validation. The proposed model will be able to simulate the entire solidification process from onset of growth to cooldown to room temperature, and will rigorously capture radiative exchanges in the three-dimensional growth geometry including internal radiation in the semi-transparent crystal. The model will calculate the unsteady temperature, velocity, and concentration fields in the charge, elastic and inelastic stresses in the crystal, and will track the shape and position of the crystal-melt interface. The simulator is designed to be useable by practicing engineers, and thus, will be equipped with powerful graphic user interfaces to insulate the user from gridding and computational details. Anticipated Benefits: The availability of a robust and validated simulator for the Horizontal Bridgman technique will introduce, for the first time, leading-edge process design and analysis capability toan important commercial sector of the materials industry involved with proudction of infrared and III-V opto-electronic materials. This capability is expected to expand the science base of HB growth process, and identify hardware and process modifications needed to improve the qulity of grown materials and the process yield.",

This rig will boost pump technology by: (1) permitting accurate determination of impeller force and moment coefficients by electromagnetic impulse excitation, orbit control, and bearing force and displacement measurement during operation, and (2) use of control theory to suppress cavitation-surge and rotating stall, the primary constraints on pump flow range. A pump with such technology would be self-diagnosing and self-correcting during operation. Proof of concept and careful calibration of the magnetic bearing system and instrumentation will be conducted on an annular seal rig. Subsequent tests will use a complete turbopump stage mou nted in the same rig, in a test loop permitting cavitating and non-cavitating pump operation over broad flow range. By improving pump range and reliability, potential application of the proposed technology is sebstantial throughout the aerospace and commercial pump industry. The 5% of U.S. energy and 25 cents of each maintenance dollar used by pumps leaves significant room for improvement. Rotating stall and rotating cavitation are serious problems for pump efficiency and reliability.

WE PROPOSE TO RAPIDLY DEVELOP SUBMILLIMETER SUPERCONDUCTING JOSEPHSON OSCILLATORS OF 100-100000 JUNCTIONS WITH UP TO 1 MW OUTPUT POWER FOR 100 GHz-3 THz FREQUENCY RANGE. PROPOSED OSCILLATORS WOULD OFFER UNPRECEDENTED PERFORMANCE IN TERMS OF POWER, EFFICIENCY, TUNABILITY, EASE OF USAGE AND COVERAGE OF THE SUBMILLIMETER BAND. THE PROJECT IS BASED ON A NOVEL DESIGN OF THE QUASIOPTICAL JOSEPHSON OSCILLATOR THAT INCORPORATES INTEGRATED TUNING ELEMENTS AT EVERY JOSEPHSON JUNCTION/ANTENNA PAIR FOR TUNING OUT THE PARASITIC CAPACITANCE AND IMPEDANCE MATCHING BETWEEN THE JUNCTION AND THE ANTENNA. ALL JUNCTIONS ARE DC BIASED IN PARALLEL THROUGH SUPERCONDUCTING LINES TO ASSURE THE IDENTICAL OSCILLATION FREQUENCY FOR ALL JUNCTIONS. JUNCTIONS ARE LOCKED IN PHASE THROUGH INTERACTION WITH THE FABRY-PEROT TYPE CAVITY. COHERENT POWER FOR THE WHOLE ARRAY IS RADIATED IN THE BROADSIDE DIRECTION. THE GOAL OF THE PHASE I IS TO DEMONSTRATE SUBMILLIMETER JOSEPHSON OSCILLATORS IN CONDUCTUS NIOBIUM TECHNOLOGY AND TO RESOLVE IMPORTANT DESIGN ISSUES FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF SUBMILLIMETER OSCILLATORS.",

The application places stringent demands on vocabulary size, speaker independence and domain robustness that exceed the capabilities of commercially available speech recognition technology. The approach proposed by this program is to use shallow Natural Language Processing (NLP) and extensive lexicons to supplement the traditional Hidden Markov Model approach to speech recognition to help achieve the required performance. This will be accomplished using a variety of very practical enhancements to existing speech and natural language modules that are available commercially or through the research community. The important role of the dictionary as a source of semantics will be exploited extensively. The proposing contractor has succeeded in applying a similar approach to enhancing text processing with NLP that resulted in a recognized commercial product.",

It will make possible the examination ofliving organisms in buffered solutions with a resolution approaching that of scanning electronmicroscopes without the elaborate sample preparation techniques required by electron microscopy. Theproposed instrument will be designed to allow rapid examination of conventionally prepared biologicalsamples on standard microscope slides. Furthermore, the new microscope would possess the inherentspectroscopic capabilities of chemical mapping of the sample with sub-wavelength resolution.

Estimation of rotor blade loads and motions are required for validation of advanced high-fidelity simulators in both military flight training and operational procedures evaluations. The instrumentation is based upon the use of distributed accelerometer sensor data with a signal processing technique, called a \"Kinemeatic Observer\", to independently determine both rotor states and forces. The proposed instrumentation system builds upon previous work by the principal investigator in using distributed accelerometers for active rotor control applications. Direct use of acceleration data provides enhanced structural reponse prediction capability that is often otherwise generated only through complex computations when using more traditional model-based estimation techniques. The proposed system, with the exception of data recording equipment, would be self-contained and generic such that it could be used in flight tests on a variety of helicopters in service by the Navy.",

This buffer is intended to relieve operating demands on present digital tape units, so to improve their reliability. The tasks will consider interface requirements from the sensors, optimum architecture, including error management and fault tolerance to achieve high availability in a mission environment. Packaging is also to be addressed; especially important because of the large number of memory chips. Also, under the proposed tasks, a preliminary design for a full-up DEM/VAL buffer will be implemented. A Phase II transition option is offered to prepare a final design for the full-up DEM/VAL buffer.",

        "abstract": "Proposed is a novel method of controlling mass storage devices (MSD) on power up, so as to force an immediate write at the location contiguous to that last written prior to power down. This technique is important for reducing power consumption in battery operated data logging systems employing MSDs. It obviates the necessity for scanning the entire contents until the last written location is found, consuming considerable power in the process. The method is applicable to COTS controllers and COTS MSDs and requires no modification to these items. The technique is implemented with commercially available parts and has applications in battery operated equipments that use MSDs. The proposed effort will determine, for Navy oceanographic applications: optimal MSDs and controllers; design appropriate MSD/controller architecture as related to power switching to conserve battery power; design, fab and test a DEM/VAL unit to operate in a PC and develop a preliminary design for a deployable unit for consideration in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "The extraordinary potential of high-temperature composite materials to meet the engineering design challenges presented by advanced turbine engines and hypersonic flight vehicle airframes is well known. However, their implementation has been seriously impeded by excessive variability in materials properties due to somewhat unpredictable microstructures subject to a host of possible defects. A novel composite monotape fabrication process is proposed which will guarantee exceptional material homogeneity. Specifically, monofilament reinforcements will be homogeneously distributed in a pore-free matrix having extremely uniform grain size. The nature of the process yields consistent fiber/matrix interface quality, virtually eliminating surface contamination. Phase I will develop the process on a laboratory scale, focusing on characterization of the geometric and microstructural features of the new materials. Prototype consolidation will be conducted. Phase II will refine, automate, and scale up the monotape process. Engineering prototypes of flight hardware will be fabricated for test and evaluation. OPTION TASK: $19,985",

        "abstract": "PROJECT SUMMARY: A novel chemistry is proposed for solder mask coatings on printed circuit boards (PCBs). This chemistry permits 100% solids application, eliminating objectionable solvents. The innovative chemistry uses a hardener blocked with a reactive component. This hardener is added to suitable monomers and oligomers containing acid (COOH) functionality along with photosensitizers and photoinitiators to comprise part A of a two part epoxy resin system. Following mixing and coating, the material is heated to dissociate the blocked hardener, resulting in partial cross linking of the epoxy, forming a tack free (B-Stage) surface. The coating is patternable with UV light which through a free radial photoreaction results in selective polymerization of the coating. The exposed material is developed with a 1% sodium or potassium carbonate water solution. A final heat cycle after developing reacts the residual hardener, acid and epoxy to form the D-Stage final material. This program will demonstrate feasibility of this approach by demonstrating this material on real circuit board blanks at a commercial printed circuit board vendor and subjecting these boards to appropriate electrical tests. This pervassive innovation could eliminate the 6 million pounds/yr. of solvents currently released in the U.S. as a byproduct of PCB fabrication. Anticipated Benefits: Environmentally conscious Printed Circuit Board Chemicals could have a global impact.",

        "abstract": "The military has a need for high power/high frequency electronics which can operate at high temperatures for applications such as radar and electronic warfare systems. While Si and GaAs are already being used near their limits of output power and operating temperature, the potential of SiC is just beginning to be realized. High frequency 4H-SiC MESFETs with an f(max) as high as 12.9 GHz, and RF output power at 1.8 GHz of 2.8 W/MM, have already been demonstrated. This power density is three times higher than that of Si or GaAs structures. However, the operating frequencies of SiC FETs are still limited by its relatively low electron mobility. The design that most ideally minimizes the effect of low electron mobility in SiC is a High Electron Mobility Transistor (HEMT). The use of a heterostructure gate (a wider bandgap layer on top of the lower bandgap SiC) allows the SiC channel region to be formed of low doped material, which has the highest mobility. For 4H-SiC, the electron mobility of low doped material is greater than 800 cm(2)/V-sec. In a HEMT, a two-dimensional electron gas is formed in the potential well of the lightly doped material underneath the heterojunction. Therefore it is proposed that nitride-based heterostructures on 4H-SiC (E(g)=3.26 eV) be investigated for their potential use in HEMTs. The three nitride systems to be investigated are GaN/SiC, and AlN/SiC alloys on SiC.",

        "abstract": "Silicon carbide (SiC) is the ideal semiconductor for fabrication of solid state devices for power conditioning for the all-electric airplane, turbine engine actuators, and space-based power systems. These applications require switches and amplifiers capable of large currents with relatively low voltage drops. The potential for improved performance is indicated by SiC's material characteristics. For example, the breakdown characteristics of a semiconductor are very important in determining the safe operating area (SOA) of a power device fabricated from that material. The measured electric breakdown field for SiC is in the range of 2-4x10 6 V/cm depending on the doping range, and is about 8-10 times higher than that of Si. This indicates that devices fabricated from SiC should be capable of supporting large DC and AC voltages. This permits the devices to amplify and switch large power levels. Due to its large band gap, SiC devices may operate at temperatures up to 700 Degrees C. The limiting factor of SiC for high power devices is currently a high defect density in SiC substrates, particularly a high density of micropipes. The latest results on liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) of silicon carbide presents the opportunity to eliminate micropipes in the epitaxial layer and significantly reduce the density of other types of defects. The micropipe free epitaxial structures grown by the proposed liquid phase technique may be used as substrates for further epitaxial growth by CVD or MBE to obtain the desired device structure, or may be used as a seed for subsequent SiC bulk growth. The primary objective of Phase I of this program is to prove that liquid phase epitaxial growth may provide micropipe free silicon carbide. The development of LPE growth process for micropipe free silicon carbide layers on 2\" wafers and fabrication of high-power large area SiC devices on this material will be the primary objective of Phase II.

        "abstract": "Though allograft human aortic valves are preferred for transplantation by virtue of their lowthrombogenicity and immunogenicity, superior hemodynamic performance, and extended durability, onlyabout 2,000 per year are implanted due to limited donated heart supply. An acellular porcine heart valvecould form the substrate of a heart valve graft after the removal of native cells and soluble proteins toablate its immunogenicity under conditions that do not alter the structural proteins of the leaflets. Thisextracellular matrix substrate can be then be repopulated with autogenous (recipient) fibroblasts whichwould synthesize proteins critical for the long-term maintenance of leaflet function as well as maskresidual xenoantigens. These studies will concentrate on the effects of the depopulation process on thebiomechanical functions of porcine heart valve leaflets with corollary examinations of the collagencontent and collagen cross-linking in treated tissues. Various depopulation paradigms will be comparedwith the goal of minimizing changes in stress/strain relationships, stress/relaxation relationships, ultimatetensile strength, and bending stiffness as compared with fresh cellular valve leaflets. While most of theexaminations will utilize tissue from adult pigs, it is clear that the type and stability of collagencross-links may change with age. Since certain target populations for heterograft valves may requireimplantation of smaller diameter valves, additional studies will focus on heart valve leaflets from juvenilepigs weighing 12-25 kg in which the diameter of the aortic valve is approximately 13-16 mm as opposedto 22-29 mm in adult animals. Since biomechanical properties and hemodynamic performance areclosely related, these examinations should help optimize the performance of depopulated heart valvesas graft elements.",

Each new spacecraft has unique approaches to control and operations, utilizing different and sometimes non-intuitive human interfaces. The loss of highly trained satellite control personnel and the large time investment required to replace them suggests an opportunity to evaluate integrating technologies which can provide a framework for future expansion which preserves the continuity of standardization of satellite control. Additionally, use of advanced technologies in visulaization, through the use of multi-media concepts could greatly enhance the effectiveness of space controllers and improve overall space control system performance. The proposed project will develop a system for multimedia based, intuitive control of satellites that will allow a single generic interface to be capable of controlling many different satellites. The specifics of the human interface necessary for control of any given satellite will conform to general guidelines to provide a standardized look and feel to the operator while also incorporating a variety of auxiliary functions designed to enhance operator capabilities and performance.",

        "abstract": "The concurrent engineering of acquired subsystems is a unique problem faced by many large manufacturers. Examples abound in the auto, aerospace, and machine tool industries. As these manufacturers push the performance characterstics of their final product they must concurrently engineer the product as they help their suppliers engineer the sub-systems. To address this problem, a distributed product information exchange program that supports inter-operation between the engineering and design tools of major manufacturers and the design and engineering tools of the suppliers needs to be developed. These tools are autonomous in that they are used daily for specific design and engineering activities. In order to achieve this objective, we propose development of several KQML servers. KQML servers recognize that the tools to which they are \"attached\" can be autonomous agents. Several KQML servers will be implemented. They are: - 3D product modeling KQML server - 2D drafting product modeling KQML server - Kinematic modeling KQML server - Parts repository KQML server. To support wide use of these servers, they will provide a PDES/STEP Standard Data Access Interface (SDAI) API for applications in the above domain. This will allow the servers to be linked into applications from different vendors in each of these domains. Anticipated Benefits: We anticipate the market for these servers to be $200 MM by 2000. The market consists of major manufacturers (e.g. GM), Regional manufacturing councils, CAD vendors, and system integrators (e.g. Arthur Anderson). Major manufacturers and regional councils will use these servers to setup knowledge based engineering information systems to collaborate with small business suppliers. CAD vendors will offer these servers as part of their framework products.",

Single crystal natural diamonds are readily available in sizes up to 5 mm x 5 mm. For larger sizes the costs are prohibitive. These sizes are inconvenient to work with in terms of large scale fabrication of electronic devices. One solution to this problem is to be able to do diamond heteroepitaxy, i.e. grow single crystal diamond on alternate substrates. Another approach is to fabricate low coordination surfaces by using nanometric surface preparation. In this research program we propose the development of approaches for the heteroepitaxial growth of single crystals of diamond on metal substrates such as copper and molybdenum and on silicon using nanometric surface preparation.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this program is to develop a silicon-on-insulator technology (SOI) using CVD diamond films as insulators. Such structures should permit the fabrication of integrated circuits with performance capabilities superior to those fabricated using conventional SOI structures including silicon-on-Sapphire (SOS), SIMOX, Epitaxial Layer Overgrowth (ELO) and Bond Etchback SOI (BESOI). Diamond insulating substrates should extend the radiation tolerance of existing SOI technologies due to their high transparency to radiation. The Silicon-on-diamond (SOD) technology is the only SOI approach that allows for efficient heat dissipation from the active regions of integrated circuits as a result of the exceptional thermal conductivity of diamond. Diamond films provide unsurpassed thermal conductivity of 20W-cm-1K-1, excellent radiation resistance of greater than 107 RAD for SOD devices and high electrical resistivity of greater than 1 x 1014 Ohm-cm. The goal of this project is to successfully fabricate SOD wafers using a wafer bonding process and to have good performance of the SOD wafers in terms of low leakage, high thermal conductivity and high radiation resistance. These performance advantages will be available for use in CMOS structures, analog circuits, BICMOS structures and radiation hard circuits. SOD wafers have application within the large SOI market where there is a demand for radiation hardness, high temperature performance and high heat dissipation from the devices. One example of the application of SOD wafers is to use them as substrates for high performance ICs used in space, in the atmosphere and on the ground. Due to the superior heat dissipation of SOD substrates, enhanced performance can be achieved in technologies such as dense bipolar integrated circuits and CMOS devices. Problems with short-channel effects and leakage in CMOS devices make a change from bulk silicon to SOD wafers desirable.",

        "abstract": "Structural analysis of helicopter rotor blades is an important and difficult problem. The difficulties stem from the use of composite materials with layer drop-offs, complex cross-sections, and possible twist or curvature of undeformed blades. A three-stage analysis approach has been developed by researchers to handle these difficulties in a way that obviates the need for very detailed and unwieldy finite element models composed of tens of thousands of solid elements. In the first stage, one soles a problem in which the cross-section is represented by two-dimensional finite elements and the outcome is a six-by-six stiffness matrix referenced to traditional beam displacements and rotations. In the second stage, these matrices are assembled and the beam equations are solved. In a third stage, detailed stresses and cross-sectional warping deformations may be recovered. We propose to assemble the latest technology for arbitrary cross-sections as well as curved and twisted shapes into a software package for convenient design/analysis of rotor blades. We will surpass the requirements of the solicittaion by adding a sensitivity analysis feature. In Phase II, optimization will be added, along with connections to CAD software, a mesh generator, and a display program for stresses and deformations.",

The key innovation is the use of piezoelectric transponder patches to perform both actuation and sensing. Advantages include (1) identical conditions for every test repetition in terms of location and orientation of actuation and sensing, (2) ability of each patch to induce strain over an area many times its own size, and (3) excitation in a medium frequency range, avoiding both low-frequency modes that are sensitive to changing store weights and high frequency dynamics that cannot be characterized by normal modes. Damage detection will be sought by comparison of frequency response functions measured on the aircraft early in its life to those measured periodically thereafter. Phase I efforts will consist of finite element simulations and bench-scale experiments using prototype piezoelectric patches on a test article of aircraft-like construction. Automated means for signature comparison and correlation with damage will be sought.

        "abstract": "The current development of an electric power generation system for the More Electric Aircraft (MEA) is based on a low-risk extension of existing three-phase, switched reluctance machine (SRM) technology. This research program proposes to study an alternate two-phase SRM and its associated power-conditioning converter. By the nature of the proposed machine, it has 50% of its stator coils active at any point in time compared to 33% for the three-phase SRM. Thus, the two-phase SRM has a potential for increased power (or torque) density compared to the three-phase SRM. (Preliminary calculations indicate at least 22% increase in power density.) Further, the stator coil and the power semiconductors switch count for the converter are each 2/3 of the number for equivalent three-phase machine. Consequently, the proposed two-phase SRM generation system should offer a signficantly smaller package with increased reliability over the three-phase SRM system presently under development. Phase I is a theoretical study to determine the two-phase SRM system configuration and to establish valid weight, volume, fault tolerance, and performance comparisons with the three-phase SRM system. A limited preliminary designs suitable for trade-off study will be produced. Design refinement is planned for Phase II. Costwise, now is the opportune time to evaluate this novel technology for potential incorporation into the MEA development. Although the proposed research program focuses on a product for aircraft application, the end result is development of technology for a simplified, robust, high power density SRM that has ready application in harsh environments (hazardous, elevated temperature), such as automotive engine pumps and cooling fans, nuclear power plant pumps, oil well pumps, and mining ventilation systems, where conventional electric machines exhibit a short MTBF.",

This method has been under development for some time and is based on measuring the polarization rotation due to glucose in solution. Laboratory results show that glucose concentrations can be measured to better than 2% of normal blood glucose levels. The primary objectives are to apply the techniques developed in the laboratory for polarimetric glucose concentration measurements to measure concentrations in enucleated eyes (to be obtained from the Connecticut Eye Bank), and to build a refined and miniaturized version of the polarimetric device as a first step towards developing a unit for home glucose monitoring. Technical issues to be addressed include demonstrating the applicability of the technique to enucleated eyes, determining the effectivenss of improving accuracy using multiple wavelength monitoring, improving the signal to noise ratio, and building a compact prototype with improved electronics. Anticipated Benefits: Non-invasive measurement of blood glucose concentration. Alternative application to non-invasive measurement of other body chemicals. Use for home glucose monitoring in diabetics. Use for non-invasive measurements of blood/body chemistry in the field.",

        "abstract": "This research will design and build an easy-to-use, 3-D imaging system for cardiac catheteriza-tion by applying a novel algorithm to produce a live, 3-D reconstruction of the coronary artery tree. Thissystem requires three or four projections and shows complex vessel cross-section in greater detail. Itprovides an efficient and more accurate method for guiding catheterization and evaluating coronaryvessel pathoanatomy than the 2-D method. With 2-D, the observer derives an estimate of the narrowingof vessel diameter by looking at, and averaging, two 2-D projections taken at right angles to each other.The limitations of the 2-D method are (1) a significant error of estimating lumen size may occur whenan atherosclerotic plaque is not perfectly round, is located eccentrically within the lumen, or has anirregular shape, and (2) foreshortened views of some parts of vessels require repositioning of the x-raycamera system. Repositioning distracts the observer, prolongs the procedure, and increases the risksto the patient, (3) repositioning requires repeated injection of the contrast dye, stressing the patientphysiologically. The new method has the potential to replace the visual interpretation of 2-D coronaryarteriograms for guiding cardiac catheterization and would supercede reliance on the 2-D method, whichhas been the 'gold-standard' for pathoanatomy of coronary heart disease. The goal is to simplify thecatheterization procedure, make it safer, and reduce its cost.",

A limiting factor in the analysis of airborne multispectral thermal infrared imagery, such as from TIMS, is the effects of the atmosphere (between the sensor and scene) on the data. Through a combination of atmospheric attenuation, re-emission, scattering and sky reflectance the purity of the spectra collected by such sensors is degraded. One approach to correcting these factors is to fly a high resolution (1-4 wavenumber) spectroradiometer along with TIMS. If the data from the two systems are co-registered, then these atmospheric effects can be partly or wholly characterized and then corrected.",

This project focuses on measuring this deradation in terms of real information loss, and on developing the tools to predict the level of degradation in varying scenarios. The impact of tactical geometry, message transmitting responsibilities, network architecture, mode of opeation, and error detection and correction (EDAC) will be considered. Mesures of information loss will be developed from information theoretic conetps and applied to determine saturation thresholds for simple scenarios. This Phase I work is designed to lead to successive phses, in which computer simulations will be built, saturation points will be determined, and the maximum number and separation of competing NPGs that can operate in the same region and still satisfy given communication requirements can be estimated.",

CDMA was developed as a multiple access network protocol for military applications during the last forty years. Recently considerable interest in using CDMA in the civilian sector has been evident. The implementation of CDMA multiple access networks is difficult because of the use of a different spreading code for each transmitter in a given network. In addition the use of different codes for each transmitter leads to system complexities which limit the suitability of CDMA networks for certain kinds of data network applications. Recent research has shown that the use of different codes in CDMA systems is not necessary for most applications in the civilian sector, and may not be desirable even in some military applications. In this proposal we describe an applied development program to development program to develop this advanced form of CDMA. Anticipated Benefits: The results of this development program can be used to build simpler, less expensive wireless data networks for mobile/nomadic laptop computers, personal digital assistants and information appliances, in-vehicle navigation and mapping systems, and work-in-progress tracking devices for automated factories.",

We also propose to simulate real-time and continuous media oriented protocols at the transport, network, and link levels that would allow for secure and robust connections to be made rapidly and maintained for multimedia communication services. During Phase I a simulation framework using the University of California, Berkeley's Ptolemy simulator will be developed. The performance of some of the wireless communication networks will be estimated using high level (behavioral level) Ptolemy simulations for different protocols, bit rates, bit error rates (BER), interferences, numbers of wireless stations connected, distances of wireless stations, and wireless technologies. Based on the simulations, protocols and wireless technologies for multimedia communication will be specified for detailed simulation and analysis in Phase II. A wireless simulation system (WSIM) will be completed during Phase II for experimenting with many wireless networks. Anticipated Benefits: The simulation system will allow experimentation with different wireless network technologies, protocols, qualities of service, and numbers of users.

In the direct manipulation interface for scenario generation, the person constructing a training scenario would \"point and click\" or \"reach and grab\" components to 1) construct a training scenario and 2) dynamically alter a scenario as it occurred. The first generation DMI scenario development system that we will construct will be based on conventional DMI techniques, such as point and click, and two dimensional representations of the visual information. The second generation DMI scenario generator will incorporate virutal reality technology to permit the scenario designer to \"reach into\" a three-dimensional library of objects and events to view and select them. To construct the scenario using the virtual reality DMI, the scenario developer will place objects and events stored in the libraries of virtual objects and events into the three dimensional virtual space of the training scenario. The objects will be given their behaviors-- trajectories and timing -- by direct manipulation through, for example, a glove that gives the developer the ability to pick up virtual objects.

In this Phase I effort we propose to determine the feasibility of meeting this requirement with a prototype multiple-ping chirp side-scan sonar to operate at high frequencies and high ping rates, where multiple pings, each uniquely identified by their frequency sweep, are in the water simultaneously, thus providing both high cross track and transverse resolution at high sensor platform speeds. The high ping rate provides for the high transverse resolution while the wide bandwidth, calibrated, chirp pulse and matched filter correlation processing enables high cross track resolution in very shallow water. A multiple-ping high resolution minehunting sonar will significantly increase the efficiency of mine search operations as the ability to cover large areas at high speeds reduces the survey time. This increased efficiency is also expected to be attractive to commercial users as the technology will be a cost effective alternative to their exisiting systems.",

        "abstract": "The proposed concept uses technology developed for the consumer entertainment market to meet the critical DoD need for low cost training simulators for use in soldiers' homes. Consumer products are emerging with unprecedented capability in graphics animation that may achieve the necessary fidelity for crew station training. The mass market potential of the entertainment industry could drive the cost to less than $2K per trainer. The technical approach defines a combat vehicle simulator based on a dual channel interactive multimedia platform, with a HDTV stereoscopic head-mounted display, 3D manual control and foot peal, stereo headphones, and a DSI interface to immerse a trainee in a realistic synthetic environment. The simulator is reconfigurable with custom software/courseware applications. The phase I objective is to demonstrate the viability of very low cost interactive multimedia platforms for crew station training in the home. All critical aspedtes of the objective system will be demonstrated with an NTSC based prototype. The proposed work includes crew station training requirements analysis, simulator concept definition, equipment integration, prototype simulations applications development, feasibility demonstration, and technical report generation. The report will address the integration of HDTV and other near-term technology into the prototype to achieve the objective capability. Anticipated Benefits: Successful demonstration of this capability will provide the Government with a training capability that extends well beyond combat vehicle simulation, to include industrial trainng and academic education in a wide variety of disciplines.",

        "abstract": "Optical fuzing of munitions using laser diode sources offers several advantages over competing technologies. These include covertness compared with microwave technologies, very high directionality, and lightweight, compact components. One serious disadvantage of laser diode fuzing for systems requiring daytime operation is the need for temperature stabilization of the laser diode when the receiver contains a narrow bandpass filter. The additional power, weight, size and complexity oflaser diode thermal stabilization precludes its use in many situations. The program proposed here addresses these problems by designing and building a bandpass filter with high thermal shift, which is matched to the laser diode. The thermal shift will be achieved by intrinsic thin-film material properties. This allows the bandpass of the filter to track the laser diode without thermal stabilization and its attendant complexity. The filter is passive in that no power sources are required for tuning. The Phase I effort will study materials and procedures to build the filter, including experimental verification of key thermal and thermooptic properties.",

The proposed model includes a representation of USN weapons development, the technical analysis process and the complicated tradeoff structure that underlies management decision-making. The model is composed of many \"modular\" components that can be replicated to reflect any specific weapons program. Changing the parameter values of each module allows the model user to represent every important step in the development process.

ATTEMPTS TO REDUCE AMBIGUITIES BY CAREFUL TAILORING OF THE PARAMETER LIBRARY INVOLVE TIME-CONSUMING ANALYSIS AND HAVE NOT GENERALLY BEEN SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE THE MIX OF POTENTIALLY AMBIGUOUS SIGNALS IS DEPENDENT ON THE SCENARIO. ATTEMPTS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF UNKNOWN SIGNALS THROUGH TECHNIQUES SUCH AS ALTERING PARAMETER LIMITS HAVE THE UNDESIREABLE SIDE EFFECT OF ALSO INCREASING AMBIGUOUS IDENTIFICATIONS. THE USE OF FUZZY LOGIC HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE MARGINALLY AMBIGUOUS AND UNKNOWN EMITTER CLASSIFICATION PROBLEMS WITHOUT OTHER ADVERSE EFFECTS. A FUZZY LOGIC-BASED CLASSIFIER WILL PRODUCE DECISIONS THAT CORRESPOND TO THE WAY A HUMAN WOULD SOLVE THE SAME PROBLEM. THE USE OF VAGUE CONCEPTS TYPICAL OF HUMAN DESCRIPTIONS OF PROBLEMS CAN BE USED IN A FUZZY CLASSIFIER TO PRODUCE A POWERFUL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM THAT TAKES ADVANTAGE OF EXISTING EMITTER PARAMETER DATA.

        "abstract": "The importance of modeling organizations and organization dynamics is becoming widely recognized. There is an emerging understanding that individuals do not usually solve large-scale problems, or necessarily even discover their existence (as individuals). Instead, organized groups of individuals embody the concepts, resources, and incentives that lead them to enunciate large-scale problems and opportunities and undertake appropriate large-scale responses. Our objective is to develop a computational model of organizations, suitable for capturing its objectives and structure, interpreting and predicting its behavior at various levels of abstraction, and detecting evolution of the organization's strategies relative to important objectives. Toward this end we have developed an organization model and an associated methodology that guides the acquisition of organization cases, interpretation of organizational data, and prediction of future behavior. We show that the methodology provides strong protection against modeling bias. All of this is illustrated in the context of a real example of organizational decision-making -- the decision by the political, scientific, and military elite to develop nuclear devices in South Africa. Anticipated Benefits: Any applications in which enough individuals are concerned with understanding and/or directing the activties of enough individuals, so that an explicit model of the organization of the latter individuals is required, will benefit. Commerical applications include businesses that need tools and methodologically sound consultancy services to get the right information to the right individuals in the organization at the right time (e.g., competitive edge, handle crisis situations).",

        "abstract": "The Phase I technical objective is to design a small \"virtual\" receiving antenna which will operate in the HF, VHF, and UHF frequency ranges (approximately 1 MHz to 1500 MHz) and then to build and test a laboratory prototype. The virtual antenna will be capable of duplicating electrically, but not physically, the wide variety of antennas necessary to receive HF, VHF, and UHF signals. The virtual antenna is extremely low profile, lightweight, and manpackable. Conventional antenna design approaches have constraints which can result in physically large structures, especially at HF frequencies. Tradeoffs between size and electrical performance are required to develop small antennas. Analysis of the most prevalent RF environment in the frequency bands of interest will be necessary to allow optimizing the antenna size and performance tradeoff. Various factors related to the RF environment are analyzed with respect to duplicating as many antenna capabilities as possible in a single package. Delfin Systems has extensive experience in the design and simulation of small portable antennas, as well as communication system analysis and design. Many of Delfin Systems' products use optimized small, lightweight antennas, and ultra low power receivers. Delfin Systems is unique in that it has developed significant expertise in the smooth transition from computer modeling of antenna designs to successful implementation in hardware. The antenna developed in this work is universal, and is capable of working with all common existing equipment; modification of existing equipment is not required. The proposed antenna offers the best tradeoff between physical constraints and desirable electrical properties, and its use or inclusion in existing systems or operational scenarious, requires a minimum of effort and retraining of the user. The virtual antenna offers appreciable advantages over existing antenna schemes.",

Antennas have certain design constraints which can result in physically large and/or complex structures. Often the need for visual covertness and concealability is at odds with the physical size required for an efficient antenna system. Delfin Systems has extensive experience in the design and simulation of small, portable antennas. Many of the Delfin Systems products use small, lightweight wide-band antennas and antenna arrays. Delfin Systems is unique in that it has developed significant expertise in the smooth transition from computer modeling to successful implementation in hardware. The primary goal is to select antenna designs offering the most complete frequency coverage in the smallest (or most easily concealed package) which can be used on the largest variety of mobile platforms. Many trade-offs must be considered with regards to frequency range, covertness, bandwidth, transmit or receive application (or both), polarization, and radiation pattern. The results of this Phase I research will provide the basis for the hardware implementation of the antenna designs in Phase II. Anticipated Benefits: The Phase I goal of covert and concealable antennas generally leads to antenna size reduction. Any advancement in the area of antenna size reduction will apply to many areas.

        "abstract": "Conventional methods for detecting traces of chemical warfare agents require: (a) collection of air, soil, or water samples, (b) analytical laboratory operations, such as chemical separation, to isolate suspected agents, and (c) laboratory analysis. Typically, this process may take days or weeks. Such long time lags and the inherent cost of labor intensive laboratory analysis are serious obstacles to effective compliance monitoring under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). Therefore, more cost effective and faster (ideally near real-time) detection and analysis methods are critically needed. This project will demonstrate the feasibility of onsite analysis using near-Infrared (IR), Fourier Transform (FT) Raman Spectroscopy. Phase I objectives are to demonstrate that (a) the technology satisfies a compelling need under the CWC, (b) the technology is capable of detecting the full range of CWC chemical compounds, (c) automated routines are capable of deconvoluting the spectrum for complex chemical compounds into its constituents without the assistance of highly trained spectroscopist, and (d) the technology can reliably operate in the field environment. Phase I will demonstrate, using model chemical systems relevant to CWC, the ability of the near-IR, FT-Raman system to analyze multicomponent chemical compounds under a realistic CWC compliance scenario. Onsite, in-situ analysis using near-IR, Fourier Transform Raman Spectroscopy provides an innovative CWC verification tool capable of detecting the large numbers of chemical compounds of interest under the CWC. This technique is capable of obtaining data on materials, in solution, and incorporates an innovative method for deconvoluting the information into data on the chemical constituents onsite. The unique aspect of field sampling is the ability to analyze chemical compounds without physical sampling and chemical analysis at distant laboratories. This technology is potentially related to any environmental sampling problem.",

Wavelet transform accepts nonstationarity and is well localized in both space and frequency domains and it is also orthogonal to avoid redundancy in the wavelet transform. Vector quantization, which encodes a sequence of samples rather than encoding each sample individually, has been proved to be a powerful tool for digital image compression. Using vector quantization to encode the wavelet transform coefficients is a novel method to exploit the advantages of both wavelet transform and vector quantization. In this proposal, we propose a design and implementation of data compression techniques by using wavelet transform and vector quatization to achieve the goal of real-time lossless data compression. The research of this project, which takes advantages of the latest development in image analysis and compression, shall lay a solid foundation for the development of the real-time lossless data compresison system. The first step is to provide detailed analysis of the proposed design and a plan for experimental evaluation.

        "abstract": "Interleukin-8 (IL-8), a newly characterized proinflammatory cytokine, is chemotactic for polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and stimulates several other agonist effects, all culminating in accumulation at the site of infection or inflammation and the full plethora of effects, including tissue injury via degradative enzymes and oxygen-derived free radicals. All of these effects are mediated by specific high affinity (Kd=10pM) IL-8 receptors (IL-8R), which are expressed in high numbers on the PMN membrane surface. Our overall objective in this Phase I project is to develop a potent and selective, small peptide IL-8R antagonist, which would have diagnostic and therapeutic potential (see below). To that end, our specific aims in Phase I are to: 1) synthesize by solid phase techniques 15 to 20 peptides containing those portions of IL-8 that appear from previous studies to be critical in IL-8R binding and/or activity; 2) examine all of these peptides for their ability to compete with I-labelled IL-8 for specific binding to IL-8Rs in isolated human PMNs or PMN membranes; and 3) evluate compounds demonstrating IL-8R binding affinity from #2 for their ability to block IL-8 induced PMN chemotaxis and elastase release by isolated PMNs. In Phase II lead compounds emanating from this effort will be evlauated in vivo for their utility as infection-imaging agents and in relevant animal models of disease in which PMNs and/or IL-8 are implicated. Anticipated Benefits: The rapid, definitive diagnosis of occult infections remains a medical problem with major economic and health consequences. A Technetium-99m-labelled IL-8R antagonist would have great medical and commercial potential for localizing infections noninvasively. A potentn, specific IL-8R antagonist also would have wide therapeutic utility in many diseases/conditions such as adult respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial infarction, cystic fibrosis, psoriasis, and septic shock.",

Recurrence is generally not fatal unless it occurs in an immunocompromised individual orwithin the central nervous system. Early detection of an active HSV infection using a rapid and sensitiveassay is essential in some situations to allow timely initiation of treatment as culture can take up to aweek in low titer infection. A new, fast, and reliable non-radioactive enzyme linked immunosorbent DNAassay has been developed and found to be highly sensitive for the human papillomavirus.

The inability to perform effectively under these evolving requirements will pose a significant threat to our overall ASW mission capabilities. New processing approaches focusing on the broadband acoustic threat characteristics in shallow water environments must be investigated to ensure the continued effectiveness of the ASW missions. The objective of this project is to evaluate existing algorithms and to identify and define innovative broadband processing algorithms for DIFAR sonobuoys. These broadband processing algorithms, by definition, will have improved detection performance over current techniques. These innovative algorithms will automatically sample different frequency bands and bandwidths to measure their energy content and will use this information to shape the frequency spectra. This will provide a dynamic adaptive matched filtering capability which will automatically maximixe the broadband signal to noise performance in real time. The adaptively filtered data will be directionally processed and sorted by bearing. The end result will optimize the overall broadband detection and bearing estimation performance of the DIFAR buoy.",

This will be accomplished by developing aninteractive computerized medical self-care decision making interface to enter and analyze some of themost common health related issues for female patients aged 18-55. An analysis structure and flowchart will direct the user through a series of questions and medical decision making branches, to provideappropriate messages and proper courses of action to follow. Related referenced text will also bedeveloped to correspond to the decisions, along with personal family and medical history forms, amedical incident diary, a medication record keeping system, and a series of medical guidelines. Duringthe development of the software program and flow charts, formative and process evaluations will beconducted with medical and behavioral experts, older student end-users, and nurse educationprofessionals. The innovative features of the medical self-care software program will make this systema comprehensive and effective means of delivering health information to female patients, and thuscompetitive in the health promotion and wellness marketplace. During Phase II, the developed softwareprogram will be field tested in a family health care center and expand medical issues to the concerns ofmales.",

These SLMs exploit an easily fabricated hybrid optoelectronic technology that places ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) light modulators directly atop silicon VLSI circuitry. We propose here to design and fabricate a small prototype FLC/VLSI SLM implementing an innovative \"universal\" function: it can be addressed either electrically or optically, or read out electrically as a camera. The Phase I effort will focus on achieving detector sensitivity and uniformity in pixels 30 micron or smaller; it should yield a prototype SLM with an array size of 32 x 32 or greater, and a frame update rate greater than 1kHz. The proposed effort includes pixel circuit design and simulation, VLSI layout, silicon integrated circuit (IC) fabrication, fabrication of FLC modulators atop the IC, and characterization of the resulting SLM. Phase II should result in arrays sizes of 256 x 256 or greater with contrast better than 200:1 and frame rates in excess of 10 kHz. The resulting SLMs will be no larger than a packaged integrated circuit like microprocessor, and will require no specialized driver circuitry beyond a standard logic-level interface.",

These image sources can be made at very low cost, while overcoming fundamental resolution, size, and cost limitations of more orthodox technologies. In addition to the image source, a complete head-mounted display (HMD) system requires viewing optics and a head tracker.

Great strides are being made in tailoring design tools to optimize a microcircuit in terms of speed, area, and power consumption by allowing the designer to judiciously trade off these conflicting characteristics against one another. DQDT has completed a phase I feasibility study on parameterized VHDL-based generators that create a gate-level description from high-level specifications. This proof of concept allows the designer to explore the design space with finer granularity than existing commercial tools. We propose to enhance an existing, parameterized VHDL-based DSP function generator by including reliability-related input information to ensure that the designed microcircuit achieves the required reliability. The feasibility of adapting this existing generator to prevent a host of potential reliability problems will be explored. Electromigration and hot-carrier degradation will be incorporated into the existing generator. Other effects could be incorporated during follow-ons to this task. By adapting an existing VHDL-based tool, the risk can be substantially reduced.",

This proposal describes a GPS-based terrain following/terrain avoidance system. The system extrapolates the region immediately ahead of ther aircraft and alerts the pilot when the current flight vector intercepts the safety margins surrounding upcoming terrain obstacles. The system performs its task using a set of proprietary \"Adaptive Realtime Altitude Detection\" (ARAD) algorithms. These compare the present GPS-derived aircraft latitude, longitude, and evaluation above sea level, with the Defense DTED data for the same location. The ARAD algorithms extrapolate ahead of the current position, giving the pilot adequate time to take evasive action in avoiding upcoming terrain. The pilot can view his current location on a computer which displays topographical and military aeronautical charts. Phase I of this project will demonstrate a prototype system including realtime display software, and the integrated graphical databases for the area around Los Angeles. Upon project conclusion, we will release all documentation and data rights to qualified U.S. firms, free of charge, in the interest of maximizing commercialization.",

        "abstract": "The FAA has documented many crashes, in all aviation domains, which it categorizes as \"controlled flights into terrain.\" This proposal describes a GPS-based terrain avoidance system. The system extrapolates the region immediately ahead of the aircraft and alerts the pilot when the current flight vector intercepts the safety margins surrounding upcoming terrain obstacles. It performs its task using a set of proprietary \"Adaptive Realtime Altitude Detection\" (ARAD) algorithms.

By extrapolating ahead of the current position, the ARAD algorithms give the pilot adequate time to take evasive action.

Upon project completion, we will release all documentation and data rights to qualitifed US firms, free of charge, in the interest of creating jobs. This project has the endorsement of the State of California. Anticipated Benefits: The proposed navigation/terrain collision avoidance system has widespread application in the commercial and general aviation sectors. It serves commercial pilots by providing a collision avoidance system for use outside FAA controlled airspace. It serves private pilots, particularly those operating under Visual Flight Rules, by providing a ground collision prevention system vastly superior to any they currently employ.",

        "abstract": "The survivability of vehicles and aircraft is greatly dependent on their mobility and level of armor protection. In most cases, mobility is best served by minimizing mass. Conversly, the level of protection afforded by an armor system is usually directly proportional to its mass. This leads to the difficult trade off of protection versus mobility. There- fore, armor systems with increased levels of protection at a fixed or de- creased mass are needed to improve survivability of the vehicle or aircraft. Plastics have all the desired properties of a good armor material; low density, impact resistance, and toughness. Investigations to this point have largly focused on transparent, moldable thermoplastic resins. However a large selection of opaque and semi-transparent thermoplastics exists that have promising properties but have yet to be ballistically evaluated. TM One such candidate material is DuPont KS(TM), a moldable thermoplastic. The objective of Phase I effort is to demonstrate the ballistic perfor- mance of thermoplastics in an armor system for use on light and ultra- light class vehicles and aircraft. We will concentrate on designing a thermoplastic system which matches the mass-efficiency of current ceramic armor systems. This will provide an armor with improved multihit capability, which is less expensive than the current ceramic-based armors. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - This program will provide a concise and comprehensive review of thermo plastics as candidates for inclusion in lightweight armor systems. Through analysis and testing, thermoplastics will be directly compared to existing systems that employ metals and ceramics. These efforts will lead to the development and evaluation of new materials for lightweight armers. These systems will provide the required level of protection at the desired areal density with multi-hit capability and at a reduced cost.",

In an advanced, alternate mode, the warhead will project a penetrator capable of neutralization through deflagration. The alternative mode employs reative intermetallic materials in the warhead's main component, the liner. On detonation of the warhead's explosive, these materials will react with a great release of thermal energy that will be delivered to the mine by the action of the warhead. The modified warhead provides an additional lethal mechanism underwater. The hot proudcts of the intermetallic reaction further react with the water to create an explosion capable of inflicting damage on the mines in close proximity. This technology will be developed in a warhead diameter that mets the mass limitation and allows for carrying by a frogman.",

Radiative transport, camera effects and water surface blurring are also modeled.

Loop Heat Pipes offer significant improvements in heat transport over conventional heat pipes, due to their fine-pored wick structures and liquid and vapor transport lines which are optimized to minimize pressure drop.

        "abstract": "Dynetics, teamed with Harris Corporation, proposes to apply our innovative spread spectrum receiver technology to produce a novel Spread Spectrum Detector for submarine electronic surveillance measure (ESM) operations. Our unique combination of hardware and algorithmic approach couples a nonlinear, wide dynamic range receiver with straightforward digital post processing, to achieve detection and characterization of spread spectrum signals. In operation, an existing radio frequency (RF) port is monitored by the receiver, which serves to: 1) provide processing gain and 2) provide robustness in dense signal environments. After processing, and estimate of the power spectral density of the incoming waveform is performed and used to determine the autocorrelation. Since the spread spectrum waveform autocorrelates with itself, regardless of waveform type, a large output singnal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is available even if the signal spectrum is significantly below the noise. During Phase I, the Dynetics team will finalize the design, demonstrate key system aspects with simulation and analysis, and conduct systematic investigation of Phase III markets.",

        "abstract": "Dynetics proposes to develop lattice wing control surface concepts for application to aircraft towed maneuverable bodies. Lattice control surface designs will be developed to meet towed vehicle stability and control requirements, maneuverability requirements, drag requirements and storage/compatibility requirements. Dynetics will use existing aerodynamic prediction techniques it has previously developed and applied as the basis for designing and evaluating the aerodynamic characteristics of lattice control surface concepts. Design parameters which will be evaluated include control surface outer dimensions, cell spacing, frame cross section thickness and shape, control surface curvature and leading edge sweep angle. Experimental data, which have been previously obtained to identify and investigate some of the critical design parameters mentioned above, will also be used where applicable. Detailed finite element structural analyses will be conducted on the concepts which appear most promising to confirm the validity of their design. Dynetics will assess possible lattice control surface storage and deployment methods as part of the design development process. Concept designs developed during Phase I of this effort will provide the starting point for the Phase II development of a prototype lattice wing controlled body suitable for demonstration either in a wind tunnel or as a full-scale towed model. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - Lattice wing control surface technology appears to be a highly efficient and effective means for controlling maneuverable towed platforms capable of carrying ECM equip- ment, missile warning systems or reconnaissance equipment. This technology also appears promising for application to submersible platforms and air launched smart weapons. Civilian uses of this technology include platforms carrying special sensors used for environmental research, natural resource management or drug smuggling surveillance.",

One is based on Ultrasonic Pulse-Echo effect (UPE), the other is an Acoustic Resonance Spectroscopy. These systems have been used to externally interrogate chemical warfare materiel and were able to discriminate between chemical agents as well as other chemicals,l in configurations ranging from munitions to bulk containers. In limited testing, the ability to discriminate between high-purity and low-purity chemicals was demonstrated. It appears that there is excellent potential to use acoustic technology to non-destructively interrogate the contents of sealed hazardous material containers, and using the characteristic signature obtained, evaluate the purityk of the contents. This information could be used to extend the shelf-life of the material. Although this method differs from that implied in the Navy submission (i.e., a purity sensor inside the container that can be queried from outside the container) this technology offers the advantage of a single system which works from outside the container, requires no internal components, has potential application to many chemicals, uses off-th-shelf components, ands can be quickly and inexpensively evaluated.",

The analytical instrument will utilize Resonance Raman Spectroscopy (RRS) for quantificationof acetaldehyde adduct formation. Resonance enhancement is wavelength specific which will, in effect,make the detecting element \"blind\" to the majority of blood components.

Phase I objective is to demonstrate the analyticalfeasibility of Raman and ROA spectroscopy for determination of optical and molecular purity of an opioidpeptide. The Phase II objective will be to develop a complete spectral library for all the opioid peptidescurrently stocked by NIDA and to provide NIDA with a prototype ROA instrument.",

Inadequate controllability can limit the agility potential through a combination of reduced control power and/or a lack of bare airframe departure resistance. Typical departure criteria include only static aerodynamic terms and are not adequate predictors for modern fighter aircraft performing high-agility maneuvers such as loaded roll motions. The development of a reliable departure resistance design criteria for highly agile, highly augmented fighter aircraft and the exploration of validation methods using 6-DOF computations and comparisons to existing flight data from the F/A-18 HARV is the subject of this study The innovation in Phase I is the inclusion of appropriate dynamic aerodynamic terms and the effects of flight control system inputs to evaluate the departure characteristics of a highly augmented high agility aircraft. Phase I will develop the enhanced criteria and demonstrate methodologies for validation. Phase II will accomplish the validation with flight test data from NASA Ames/Dryden for the F/A-18 HARV, x-31 and X-29A aircraft. The expected payoff will be a validated tool to evaluate agility and departure tradeoffs in preliminary design that will result in significant cost and time savings in the development of new configurations and will provide an additional means of evaluating the performance characteristics of augmented aircraft prior to flight.",

The heat exchanger panels for the proposed scramjet power system must withstand temperatures in excess of 2300 degrees F for significant periods of time. The panel substrate material has been proposed to be Mo-47% Re alloy, which has the required thermal capability, except for the fact that it rapidly oxidizes at this temperature. It has also been determined that a platinum, or possibly a platinum sandwiched rhodium, coating will afford the most reliable oxidation protection for the system. This proposal addresses problems encountered to date in applying such coatings to the refractory substrate. Bonding and coating porosity have been major drawbacks. The proposed work package will develop solutions to these problems by providing new processes for better preparation of the substrate for application of high density platinum (or platinum-rhodium) coatings of high bond integrity and excellent oxygen corrosion performance.",

There are four major elements in the generalized EV: (1) prime source (engine generator); (2) storage (batteries or flywheels); (3) propulsion (motor and speed controller); and (4) auxiliary loads (lights, HVAC, wipers). The various alternatives for the four major elements operate in environments of highly disparate electrical power - AC versus DC, different voltages, etc. The proposed electrical system will have the flexibility to utilize any type of advanced components which is being developed or will be developed. These elements can be linked together due to the remarkable flexibility and performance of the unipolar series resonant converter. While reconciloing disparate power, it can resonant converter. While reconciling disparate power, it can function as a variable-speed motor control which is efficient, silent, small and regenerative, and can control any type of motor which is a candidate for EV propulsion. The converter will eliminate any the interfacing hardware and permit the optimization of each of the elements with regard for the others. Finally, the converter will eliminate any need for a battery charger since it can perform that function also. In this project, an operating protoype will be adapted to the EV and will demonstrate all of the typical operating modes. Anticipated Benefits: In addition to the benefits described above, the resulting designs and technologies can be used by industry and the government in the following applications: variable-speed drives and actuators, variable-speed generation systems, inverters for photovoltaic cells, and fuel cells and batteries, frequency changers, uninterruptible power supplies and power conditions.",

The low cost of the device allows frequent replacement, thereby ensuringproper monitoring of the patient's health and reducing the likelihood of serious complications. Inoperation, the patient would press a handheld controller against the lower abdomen whenever voidingis desired, and push a button. The handheld unit transmits a magnetic command signal through theabdominal tissues which directs the valve to open, allowing the bladder to void. When finished, thepatient commands the valve to return to its closed state. Under Phase I, a proof-of-principle demosystem will be constructed to validate the overall system concept.

Chemical transducers will be Co macrocycle complexes which are known to reversibly bind O2 with concomitant changes in the absorption spectrum. These changes will be detected via an optical fiber. Co macrocycle complexes will be incorporated into O2 permeable polymeric matrices to both enhance stability and facilitate their immobilization onto the fiber optic. This will allow for remote sensing of dissolved O2., and in combination with optical time domain reflectometry techniques, will permit multisite monitoring to be feasible. The final product will be an innovative detector for dissolved O2.",

The most critical performance criterion of these enclosures is shielding effectivess (SE) where SE is defined as 20 times the logarithm of the ratio of the electric fields inside and outside the enclosure or 20 times the logarithm of the ratio of the magnetic fields. SE of enclosures has traditionally been measured by teither MIL-STD-285 or NSA 65-6. Both of these standards are over 25 years old and have poor repeatability, as great as 40 dB. Recently, the IEEE has promulgated IEEE-STD-299-1991 which addresses and corrects some of the deficiencies of MIL-STD-285 and NSA 65-6, but the new standard is also subject to poor repeatability. None of these standards attempt to measure SE as a functio of wave impedance where wave impedance is deifned as the raio of the magnitude of the electric to magnetic field. Wave impedance is particularly important to the Navy as topside enclosures are exposed to high-power HF communications whive have widely varying magnetic and electric field components. The proposed Phase I effort is a multi-step process of which the final product will consist of the theory, statistics, and software necessary to measure the shielding effectiveness of electromagetic barriers with respect to frequency and wave impedance using established coherent-measurement techniques.",

The image can be viewed directly or remotely by using a CCD camera. Pressure waves established by an acoustic transducer and reflected by the target, as well as the background bottom, can be converted into a visible image for target identification by a diver using the hand held device. The phenomenon used allows sensitivity levels of 10 -14 W sec/cm. In Phase I the contractor will investigate the engineering specifications applicable to the design of a small, hand held, real-time, acoustic imager for conditions of limited optical visibility.

It explores the feasibility of developing a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code based on the p-version of the finite element method, which alleviates some of the inherent limitations and difficulties of established finite difference/finite volume methods for such flows. Numerical difficulties related to unphysical oscillations or nonconvergence that are usually corrected by \"upwind\" schemes will be specially addressed and are expected to be more efficiently suppressed by the higher order approximation of the p-FEM using a non-iterative predictor corrector approach that also eliminates the false diffusion inaccuracy caused by the upwind formulation used in conventional finite difference/finite volume and h-version finite element methods. An existing research version of a p-FEM code developed by Alabama A&M University for NASP will be modified to implement a p-FEM CFD formulation for incompressible flow. The dominant factors that control the efficiency of the p-FEM model in eliminating the limitations of finite volume/h-FEM models will be identified through sensitivity analysis of the p-FEM model on benchmark problems.",

        "abstract": "We propose to demonstrate a new optical measurement of velocity gradient based on direct observation of the differential displacement of a marked fluid element in ordinary, unseeded air. The method utilizes a pulsed laser beam to \"write\" an arbitrary pattern, such as a line or a cross, into air by means of stimulated Raman vibrational excitation of oxygen. After suitable time delay, during which the velocity gradient causes the pattern to distort, the new pattern is determined via fluorescence induced by a second laser beam. An image of the new pattern is captured with a video camera. Distortion of a line will determine point of laminar-to- turbulent transition, whereas rotation of a cross will yield vorticity. By writing a grid, multiple spatial location can be probed simultaneously. The use of a pair of cameras, imaging orthogonal planes, results in a full, three-dimensional vector. The accuracy of the method is limited only by the ability to determine time and displacement, and can be performed at vector collection rates of 30 Hz using commercially available equipment. In this effort we propose a detailed study, including appropriate laboratory proof-of-concept measurements, of the applicability of the technique to advanced aircraft testing. The results of this effort will be a prototype system designed for aircraft flight testing applications.",

Where possible, ordnance can be recycled, or converted into higher-value-added products for industry or government use. However, when these options have been exhausted, the only remaining alternatives to OB/OD are destruction through oxidation - usually be incineration. Since military ordnance contains considerable potential chemical energy, an alternative is proposed to convert this energy into electrical grid power or useful steam, for use by the military, industry, or the civilian sector. This approach meets the DoD/DOE objectives for recycle, reuse and recovery, and can be done at no risk to either the public or the environment. Past work in this area, focussing on high explosives, suggests that ordnance must be considered on a compound-by-compound basis.

THE PULVERIZATION PROCESS IS NON-SELECTIVE, HOWEVER, AND PRODUCES FINE MINERAL MATTER THAN CAN PASS THROUGH THE CLASSIFIERS AND CONTRIBUTE TO ASH FOULING AND EMISSIONS OF TOXIC METALS AND SULFUR OXIDES.  IN CONTRAST, THE SELECTIVE COMMINUTION PROCESS CAN SOFTEN AND FRAGMENT THE CARBONACEOUS MATRIX OF CRUSHED COAL PRIOR TO PULVERIZING, WITHOUT AFFECTING THE PYRITIC AND QUARTZ MINERAL COMPONENTS.

These modules would be integrally laminated or bonded to the exposed surfaces of existing cases for the equipment, thereby retaining the physical protection, support, rigidity and electro-magnetic protection already provided. Alternatively, they could be similarly incorporated into cases newly designed to maximize surface exposure to the sun. The size, weight, and thickness of the cases would not be substantially increased due to the thinness and lightness of the modules.

        "abstract": "The goal of this Phase I effort will be to develop long cycle life insoluble zinc electrodes which will be utilized in an ERC type bipolar nickel-zinc battery for hybrid and electric vehicles. The proposed investigation is based on ERC's hypothesis thatthe zinc electrode can be made to operate electrochemically like a cadmium electrode, i.e., during discharge proceed directly from the metallic phase to an insoluble oxidized species like Zn (OH)2. We propose to accomplish thisby 1) modifying the electrolyte composition to prevent the formation of soluble zincate ions and 2) make the insoluble discharge produce electronically conductive by \"doping\" with selected metallic ions. The most promising electrode/electrolyte systems will then be tested in bipolar nickel-zinc batteries which will yield in scale up electric vehicle versions 80-88 Wh/Kg energy density, >300 W/kg power density and provide >600 deep discharge cycles at the C/3 rate. The anticipated benefits of the development are viable electric or hybrid vehicle propulsion systems to meet commercial and military requirements for passenger cars, trucks and armorecd vehicles. When coupled with ERC's low cost electrode manufacturing technology, vehicle batteries could be produced for $100-150 per milowatt-hour. Anticipated Benefits: Long life, high energy density nickel-zinc batteries for commercial and military hybrid and all electric vehicles, marine propulsion and remote site power.",

ERC, with the Center for Electro-chemical Systems and Hydrogen Research at Texas A&M University, proposes to develop PEM fuel cells with lightweight component materials. Although the PEM fuel cell is the leading candidate for an automobile power source meeting the future zero emission requirement, its power density is currently an order of magnitude below the 400 W/kg criteria proposed by DOE. The major contributor (75-90%) to the stack weight is the graphite bipolar plates. The Phase I effort will focus on further improvement of the electronic conductivity of the lightweight alternative bipolar plate material which has already shown promising results in single cell testing. The new bipolar plate will be approximately half of the weight of the present graphite plate. Phase I work will also include otpimization of electrode structure and membrane and electrode assembly with the lighweight conductive bipolar plate. Scale-up cell testing and multicell stack design will also be performed. Phase II will provide demonstration of the lightweight and compact PEM fuel cell stack with thermal and water management. Anticipated Benefits: The anticipated benfits will range from a lighweight protable power source for defense and military applications to a compact, environmentally benign, high power density vehicular power source.",

The benefits are reduced heat exchanger weight and improved heat exchanger performance that reduces the coolant flow rate needed to meet temperature requirements. Phase 1 will fabricate small integrated test articles to begin assessment of their thermal, mechanical and pressure containment characteristics.

The operational principal of the sensor is based on the UV-induced fluoresence emission of rare-earth ion doped thermographic phosphors (TGP). With a multidimensional thermal imaging system, the sensor permits simultaneous characterization of planar mapping of transient surface temperature and local heat transfer. The non-intrusive nature of the proposed sensor technology makes it far superior to the existing thin-film gauges and thus significantly reduces the complexity of the test rigs. The feature is particularly attractive to resolve unsteady phenomena in rotating machinery. The TGP-baded system inherits rapid response-time, superb spatial resolution, and high-temperature (near engine conditions) capability. All the aforementioned features more than fulfill the specigfications required by the DoD SBIR solicitation. Research performed during the proposed Phase I study will result in critical design information for the Phase II effort for actual sensor fabrication.",

TRADITIONALLY, RELIABLE INTRUSION DETECTION CAN BE DIFFICULT BECAUSE NOISE LEVELS CHANGE WITH TIME AND LOCATION, AND AN INTRUSION MAY PRODUCE A WIDE RANGE OF SIGNALS OR VARIATIONS OVER THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SENSORS.  ACCOMMODATING THESE VARIATIONS IS NOT PRACTICAL USING STANDARD CLASSIFICATION TECHNIQUES.  A SELF-ORGANIZING CLASSIFICATION TECHNIQUE, SUCH AS A NEURAL NET, PROVIDES A MEANS FOR LEARNING THE IDIOSYNCRASIES OF A PARTICULAR LOCATION AND FULLY UTILIZING DATA FROM VARIOUS INTRUSION DETECTION SENSORS (SEISMIC, ACOUSTIC, ELECTROMAGNETIC, TEMPERATURE, PRESSURE, ETC.).  MANY METHODS OF NEURAL NET CONSTRUCTION HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED.  MOST HAVE DEFICIENCIES FOR INTRUSION DETECTION.  AN IMPRACTICAL NUMBER OF TRAINING INSTANCES MAY BE REQUIRED, OR THE CONFIDENCE OF DETECTION MAY NOT BE RELIABLY INDICATED.  THE GPF METHOD OF NEURAL NET CONSTRUCTION HAS DEMONSTRATED A SUPERIOR ABILITY TO CHARACTERIZE COMPLEX CLASSES AND TO QUANTIFY THE CONFIDENCE OF CLASSIFICATION.  THE PHASE I EFFORT WILL SET UP A TESTBED INCLUDING A VARIETY OF SENSORS, AND WILL MONITOR/RECORD ALL SENSOR OUTPUTS SIMULTANEOUSLY AS SIMULATED INTRUSIONS OCCUR.

THE FALSE ALARM RATE AND PROBABILITY OF DETECTION WILL BE COMPARED TO THOSE OF THE INDIVIDUAL SENSORS, AND THIS APPROACH WILL BE OPTIMIZED FOR PHASE II.

        "abstract": "Bacterial Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a component of gram negative bacterial cell walls thatinduces endotoxic shock by stimulating secretion of toxic mediators by macrophages. Derivatives ofbacterial LPS with reduced toxicity and sublethal doses of native LPS protect against endotoxic shockif given prophylactically, since they both induce tolerance to subsequent LPS exposure at toxic levels.Most of these LPS derivatives do, however, exhibit some toxicity themselves, and the induced toleranceis transient (hours to a few days). The window of opportunity for use of this type of therapy, therefore,is small. Francisella tularensis is a gram negative bacterium with a unique LPS: this LPS is apparentlynon-toxic in animal models, nonreactive in vitro for stimulating cytokine production by macrophages, anda thousand times less reactive than Samonella LPS on a weight-for-weight basis in an amoebocyte lysisassay. Yet, Francisella infection in humans induces LPS hyporesponsiveness. Francisella's unique LPS,then, may induce endotoxin tolerance without toxicity. The general goal of this Phase I proposal is toexamine whether Francisella LPS will be a useful immunotherapeutic agent to protect againstendotoxemia or gram negative infection. The specific aims are to (1) produce Francisella LPS insufficient quantity to test its activity, (2) determine its toxicity and reactivity, and (3) assess in vivotolerance induction by Francisella LPS alone or incorporated into liposomes.",

        "abstract": "Effective in situ bioremediation relies on an assessment of the degradative potential of naturally occurring organisms at contaminated sites, and/or our ability to monitor the performance of added microorganisms. Arbitrarily-primed polymerase chain reaction (AP-PCR) involves the use of a short piece of single-stranded DNA, of arbitrary mucleic acid sequences, to facilitate the amplification of genomic DNA. The pattern of amplified DNA fragments produced provides a unique \"finger print\" that allows the identification of bacterial isolates. The procedure is rapid and specific, and it may be adapted to identify large numbers of isolates. The proposed project will employ AP-PCR to identify bacteria which may be used for bioremediation, and to identify bacteria from contaminated environments. Phase I will involve an initial assessment and optimization of the technique for identifying degradative bacteria. Variations in PCR primers and reaction conditions, as well as, methods for sample preparation, cell lysis, DNA isolation, and pattern recognition and comparison will be evaluated to insure reproducible results. The goal of the project is to develop a rapid, cost effective, commercially attractrive method for preliminarily characterization of potential bioremediation sites, and to rapidly identify added organisms to assess their survival of proliferation.",

This project will address this critical issue by surveying the composite materials used in weapon systems, researching the possible approaches to recycling/reuse, analyzing recycling/reuse processes, and narrowing down the alternatives to one preferred strategy and one alternative strategy to be demonstrated in Phase II. The project will conclude with a final detailed report outlining the pros and cons of one preferred strategy and one alternate one of which will be demonstrated in Phase II and ultimately put into production at Production Products, Inc. in Phase III.

        "abstract": "A remote sensing, atmospheric lidar wind profiler is described that has 1 m/s accuracy and 50 m resolution and is both eye-safe and cost effective. Wind profiling by Doppler lidar has been shown to be feasible, but commercially available systems that are reliable, affordable, and suitable for automatic operation have not yet been developed. This development consists of employing in combination the edge filter-technique of Korb, Gentry and Weng and the pseudo- random coding technique described by Rall, Abshire and Manizade and by Takeuchi, et al. This work will demonstrate that the two techniques can be used in combination if the demodulated edge filter output is normalized with a separately demodulated aerosol return. The objective of the work is to validate the system concept and create an implementation plan for an experimental field demonstration. System modeling and experimental testing of critical components and subsystem concepts is needed. The result of the work will be a baseline design for a cw wind lidar system that meets all requirements. The successful development of a cost effective wind profiler lidar will result in significant numbers of such instruments being manufactured for use in general and aviation specific meteorological, and pollution transport applications.",

        "abstract": "Long term ex vivo therapy for kidney failure has been achieved, so that the kidney may be thefirst solid organ in which tissue engineering concepts can produce an implantable device for long-termin vivo replacement therapy. To replace the kidney's excretory function, an implantable bioartificialkidney requires both a device to replace blood ultrafiltration performed by renal glomeruli and a deviceto replace transport regulatory function of the renal tubule. We have developed early prototypic devicescapable of these functions. The Phase I efforts will consolidate these efforts by identifying the bestcombination of synthetic materials, biologic compounds and cell components to produce an implantablebioartificial kidney. A bioartificial glomerulus will be produced using two different approaches. Oneapproach is to promote targeted angiogenesis with the use of angiogenic factors to promote capillarygrowth around polysulfone hollow fibers with high hydraulic permeability but with a high reflectioncoefficient for proteins greater than 25,000 daltons. A second approach is to promote confluent growthin bioreactors of autologous endothelial cell monolayers along the inner surface of polysulfone hollowfibers. Experiments are planned to test the functional capacity of these two approaches to replace renalfiltration. Our ultimate goal is to develop the initial functioning prototypes of an implantable bioartificialkidney containing a filtration device connected to a tubule processing unit. This grant will develop acritical foundation for the Phase II grant which will develop an implantable device to replace renalfunction in patients with end stage renal disease to circumvent the need for long-term dialytic therapyor renal transplantation.",

        "abstract": "This proposal describes a high performance storage server that combines the best of existing technology with an innovative fuzzy logic control strategy that has the potential of providing substantially improved system performance. The proposed system fills a void in current technology by directly addressing the issue of intelligent pre-fetching of data. The pre-fetching mechanism is totally contained within the storage server and is thus applicable to a wide range of host computer systems and disk technologies. The two primary innovations in this approach are: 1) an adpative Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Engine (NFIE) and 2) a scatter-gather mechanism closely coupled to a large cache memory. The scatter-gather mechanism eliminates the need to manage cache fragmentation and its associated software overhead. This combination can provide a substantial improvement in the cache hit rate for read operations without sacrificing write bandwidth. The high performance storage server will directly benefit large data repositories, high performance scientific computing installations, and will be especially beneficial to network file servers. The plug-and-play design of the server makes these performance improvements immediately available to existing installations. Anticipated Benefits: This high performance storage server design has the potential for meeting the high I/O requirements of future generations of high performance computers. Its plug-and-play design alos permits its use in supporting the large installed base of high performance computer facilitieis thus allowing immediate commercialization of the produce.",

        "abstract": "The goal of this two phase project is to develop a surgical simulation system for arthroscopic and laproscopic surgery. This system will immediately improve physician training, and with further development, would be a vehicle for remote care delivery. Minimally invasive surgery promises to change the practice of medicine in many specialties. Because of the decreased trauma hospital stays are shortened, procedures can be performed on an outpatient basis, and tools can be used for diagnosis in the office. Training difficulties are one impediment to this trend. Minimally invasive surgery is more difficult then open surgery, and requires adaptation to new tools and constraints. The surgical simulator technology speeds up training making it possible for more surgeons to use less invasive procedures and allowing more complex procedures to be performed. The goal of the phase I project is to demonstrate a prototype of a minimally invasive surgical simulation system. A 4 degree-of-freedom force feedback arthroscopic tool holder will be slaved to a synthetic knee arthroscope display. Users will be able to touch objects with the tools and feel the resulting tool forces. The intensity of the feedback will be adjustable to intensify the differences between objects and enhance learning. Anticipated Benefits: The surgical simulator is a commercial product of use to the DOD, NASA, and all major teaching hospitals and centers. In addition, the 4 DOF tool holder component of the surgical simulator has application as a virtual reality manipulator for research. Finally, it could be used as a small robotic device for test-tubes, pharmaceutical production, and silcon wafer facilities.",

Such adaptability is important to both DoD and dual-use civilian structures requiring accurate positioning or shaping, active vibration cancellation, automatic internal response to damage, and automatic external response to chemical, electromagnetic or optical phenomena. Fiber & Sensor Technologies (F&S) proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating low-cost, high yield shape memory foil (SMF)-coated optical fibers directly during fiber manufacturing. Such fibers would allow the co-location of actuation and sensing functions in a single integrated structural micro-element. Many such fibers could be integrated within a composite component to provide low frequency, high authority actuation, as well as direct measurement of local displacement and thermal effects. Associated benefits of this program would include the development of sputtering methods for low cost SMFs, and improvements in the use of optical fiber sensors in Smart Materials and Structures. Anticipated Benefits: The proposed integrated actuactor/sensor/ structural fiber offers potential use in Smart Materials and Structures for both DoD and civilian programs. The sputtering manufacturing method and devices developed could be directly applicable to a wide range of dual-use commercial applications, such as 1) the active acoustic control of consumer products such as automobiles and consumer appliances, 2) precision vibration control for high performance manufacturing, and 3) control of rotating buildings and machines.",

        "abstract": "A need exists for low cost-per-station density measurements to be made in conjunction with many moored and free-drifting oceanographic platforms. This need is particularly acute in situations where Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP's) are used on a measurement string. The ADCP has the advantage of being able to remotely profile the velocity field up to several hundred meters away from the instrument with resolution of tens of meters. However, this remote sensing capability means that if an ADCP alone is deployed, no measurements other than velocity will be made along the ADCP profile. A solution is to place in-situ sensors along the mooring line with matched resolution to the ADCP, however, the cost per station of presently commercial available systems prevents such measurements. Falmouth proposes to demonstrate the ability of FSI's Industrial Temperature Conductivity sensor to provide low-cost, real-time density measurements for applications such as those described above. The existing sensors would be modified for 1) high accuracy (25 ppm in salinity) appropriate to the oceanic environment, and 2) integrated with real-time telemetry using WHOI proven inductive modem techniques. SBIR Phase I funds would be used to demonstrate the ability of a prototype system which would meet performance and cost goals.",

In this program we will test the novel concept of combining color sequential filters with white light field emitter array (FEA) displays using an experimental 512X512 pixel headset size FEA display as a demonstration vehicle. This is desired in order to provide color video output at the same resolution as the monochrome display at low potential manufacturing cost derived from a reduction in electronics and connector complexity. Field emitter displays possess the potential to provide high resolution, high brightness, full color, wide viewing angle high energy efficiency, low manufacturing cost, low driver cost, thinness, and possess small overall volume.

Efforts to demonstrate these capabilities and apply them have been held back by the fabrication methods that are currently available. Most of these methods cannot, among other limitations, reliably provide structures with more than one or two electrodes. The demonstration and application of useful devices will require fabrication processes capable of far more advanced structures and much greater design freedom. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate a novel new inverted field emitter device fabrication method that is based on an inverted structure. It uses a conformal film to form a cusp that acts as a mold for a sharp self aligned emitter. The process has many advantages including the ability to provide a wide range of diverse structures and configurations. Anticipated Benefits: The highly flexible new fabrication process being demonstrated in this Phase I project will speed the way toward the demonstration of field emitter device capabilities the implementation of those capabilities into practical applications, and the ultimate volume manufacture of the resulting products. Applications include the creation of complex lens structures, on emitters for projection electron beam exposure systems, electron beam projection display systems, and high transconductance amplifiers based on beam electron shifting.",

This effort addresses needs for cost effective manufacturing, improved damage resistance, and reduced noise transmission. The overall objective of Phase I is to select a material set for eventual fabrication into stiffener components. The specific objectives are to determine the effects of braid interlacing, fiber combinations, and resins types on the in-plane mechanical, acoustic, and impact properties of the final composite. In a two task effort, thin guage flat panels made from hybrid braids of carbon, glass and Kevlar fibers and three types of epoxy resin will be tested and the data compared. In a final task, a demonstration component will be fabricated and tested. We expect to find that hybrid braids and low cost resins can provide cost effective improvements to composite acoustic and impact properties. We expect that Phase I results will lead directly to Phase II hardware fabrication and testing. Teamed with Beech Aircraft, we expect to eventually test full scale wings and fuselage sections, receive FAA certification and commercialize a new generation aircraft per NASA's long term goals.",

The laser medium proposed to be developed is a manganese-doped, barium ortho-vanadate crystal: Mn:Ba3 (VO4)2. This crystal has been grown by Fibertek for preliminary evaluation. The laser action has been observed as well. The initial results showed that the lasing wavelength was at the vicinity of 1.18 m, that the laser operation was a three-level operation and that the laser can be pumped by flashlamp. Fibertek proposes to refine the process of the crystal growth, to modify the host composition and to adjust the Mn dopping concentration to a) tune the laser wavelength to 1.178 m and b) to make it more efficient for pumping. Fibertek proposes to use the laser-heated-pedestal growth method to grow crystal samples for spectroscopic study and determine the appropriate host composition and Mn concentration, and the Czochralski growth method to grow large size crystals for laser performance chartacterization. Fibertek also proposes to conduct additional investigations for other possible candidates of solid-state laser media that would lase at 1.178 m.",

This work will build on technology being transferred from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Two JPL projects funded by BMDO are closely related to this project. JPL will assist in the transfer of technical results from these two projects to this SBIR effort. The ultimate product goal of the project is to produce a multi-gigabit per second HIPPI extender to link supercomputing sites. The first step will be to build and test such an extender using discrete components. Then, based on the array processing techniques developed at JPL, Ortel will produce multiple element, single wavelength, distributed feedback (DFB) laser array chip to be used as the building block for an integrated HIPPI extender. The modular design of the extender will allow its adaption to other high speed protocols such as SONET, Fiber Channel, and SCI. Phase I will identify laser structures for DFB arrays, define the packaging requirements for the arrays, develop approaches to the WDM power combiner, and define a specification for the HIPPI extender. Anticipated Benefits: The multi-gigabit computer bus extenders developed in this project will not only link supercomputing centers over optical fibers, but will also form an important basis for high speed interconnections between next generation computers, workstations, and their peripherals.",

        "abstract": "The availability of energy storage capacitors with high energy densities (>1- kJ/kg AND >15 MJ/m3) is critical for many applications. existing capacitor designs use laminated assemblies which are impregnated with liquid dielectrics. However, since the dielectric strength of liquids is generally much less than for solids, the maximum operating electric field is limited by the impregnant. This, in turn, limits the attainable energy density. The objective of the proposed phase i project is to determine the technical feasibility of the R-CAP concept. This is expected to substantially increase the energy density of existing capacitor designs through the use of a novel solid impregnation process. the R-CAP-CAP concept builds on the large amount of work already performed by capacitor developers. It offers the potential to extend energy densities by factors of >5 quickly and with minimal investment. The proposed phase I tasks are to: (1) impregnate and test capacitor windings of conventional high energy density design to demonstrate the efficacy of the R-CAP concept; (2) make preliminary variations in the impregnant and processing parameters with the objective of increasing the energy density by more than a factor of two; and (3) develop plans for optimizing the R-CAP technique with the most advanced existing capacitor designs. The Phase II goal will be to increase the energy density by factors of >5 for large energy storage capacitors. Energy storage capacitors manufactured using the R-CAP technique are expected to offer higher energy densities, longer life and higher reliabilities than possible with existing capacitor fabrication methods. This will be valuable for numerous government and commercial applications including: (1) electrothermal guns; (2) lightweight lasers and microwave generators; and, (3) space systems.",

Bellows seals, considered zero-emission devices by the EPA, are urgently needed to meet current and future more stringent fugitive emissions requirements, but their sensitivity to static pressure and pressure fluctuations make them unpredictable in application. This invention pressure-balances the bellows to stabilize life, currently measured in low-thousands of cycles, and increase it, where needed, to 10 5 or 10 6 cycles while remaining insensitive to process pressure conditions. The program will demonstrate ability of this innovation to yield constant life and near-zero leakage at any operating pressure from zero psia to thousands of pounds per square inch, and over a wide range of temperatures. The program under Phase I will build a group of axial motion bellows seals of this new concept, perform life tests on the seals under a controlled temperature and pressure environment typical of the conditions that cause ordinary bellows seals to fail unpredictably, and analyze the results. The findings will lead to a design for commercialization of the seal, and a next-generation of economical, long-life, zero-emission valves. Anticipated Benefits: Establish a new manufacturing facility in Cookeville, TN, located midway between Nashville and Knoxville. Project $6 MM sales in five years, producing 100,000 seals annually, employing 40 hourly and 15 salaried employees. Furnish bellows seals to US and worl-wide valve industry for OEM and aftermarket.",

However, one current problem in the design and acquisition of simulation and training systems is that they are often fielded without the capability to incorporate realistic stress exercises. They are fielded this way not because of a meer oversight, but because information is not available to the designer on how to implement combat-relevant stressors. The primary objective of the proposed research is to develop a Combat Stress Test Bed (CSTB) to evaluate specfic technologies and training approaches for implementing stress in training devices and simulations. The development of the CSTB will provide a means to evaluate the applicability of emerging technologies for simulating the stress environment, provide a test bed for evaluating the effectiveness of alternative approaches for implementing stress training, and serve as a prototype for a low-cost desktop stress trainer.",

        "abstract": "Periodically poled waveguides on lithium niobate and other nonlinear materials capable of quasi-phase-matched second harmonic generation have recently achieved conversion efficiencies above 100% per watt. Combined with semiconductor diode lasers, such waveguide devices promise compact sources of blue and green light (390-490 nm) with power above 2 mW today and above 100 mW in the future. An essential prerequisite is a stable pump source, such as the external-cavity diode lasers (ECDL's) produced by New Focus, Inc. The second harmonic can be tuned by varying the input wavelength and the temperature of the nonlinear waveguide simultaneously, or designing a broad phase-matching band. In some applications such as holographic data storage and process monitoring, tunable narrowband blue and green light is highly desirable. The ECDL- doubler concept provides convenient tunability with little increase in complexity. We propose to combine periodically poled waveguide technology with compact new ECDL designs to achieve a tunable blue;green source in a 4\"x4\"x6ii package, which may be reduced to 1iix1\"x3ii - or even smaller - by incorporating micro-optical and micro-mechanical components, The success of this program will facilitate for compact nonlinear optical sources in the 3000 - 5000 nm range.",

        "abstract": "Efficient use of storage aboard space vehicles and manned bases will grow in importance as mission duration is extended and resupply becomes necessary. Foods, prepared in individual portion- packs, convenient for short duration missions, may be a disadvantage for longer missions because of storage space taken up by extra packaging, and packaging waste after the food is consumed. This project would develop and investigate the technical feasibility of concepts aimed at reducing the amount of packaging to provide more food storage. These concepts focus on using versatile food intermediate products in bulk, resealable and/or edible packaging. Intermediate products would be removed as needed, and the package resealed. Phase I would select foods typical of the Space Station/FASI-developed CELSS menus to demonstrate the concept. Selected foods might include; a casserole, bread, a pasta dish, and a vegetable dish. Intermediates for these might include: compressed freeze-dried vegetables, wheatberries, dry noodles, dried nonfat milk solids, sugar, salt, and yeast. While personnel involvement in food preparation could increase with this approach, this should be more than offset by cost savings resulting from reductions in the number of resupply missions needed otherwise.",

Cultivars currently being develop for NASA are significantly higher in protein than is desirable for baking. Wheat protein (gluten) has a \"chewiness\" and bland flavor which make it highly useful as a meat analog. Common gluten separation processes rely on large quantities of water to elute starch, or extremely fine differences in settling velocity. Neither technique, as currently used, meets space requirements. Significant modifications or completely new approaches are needed. An alternative solution would use low protein flours as diluents to reduce ultra-high protein flours to levels satisfactory for baked goods and pasta, etc. Potential diluents include both wheat and potato flour. Each of these pose possible technical disadvantages as well as eliminating the use of gluten as a meat replacement. This project would examine in detail the practical merits and drawbacks of various modified and new separation techniques as well as alternative solutions such as diluents, and conduct trials as needed to assess their technical feasibility.

Better health and safety standards are required for protection of humans and even vital animals like livestock or pets. Computer modeling can do much to enlighten us on how this radiation affects us: where it concentrates in the body, how it interacts, how far it penetrates. The proposed project will model pulsed electromagnetic radiation impinging on biological tissue. The method used is a variation of Helmholtz-Kirchhoff theory developed by Forward Vision that has been modified to account explicitly for the dispersive nature of living tissue and for time-dependent interactions. Using our new technique, we were able to reproduce the results of Albanese, et al.,2 that gave early warning of a potential health danger. Earlier demonstrated success of our theory at modeling wave propagation across arbitrary shapes and through multiple layers lends confidence for future success. The Phase I effort will have multiple parts. We will model the propagation of an electronmagnetic pulse into a dispersive medium with an irregular surface and use three-dimensional graphics to display the effects. We will verify the accuracy of the method in treating layered media by calculating the propagation of a harmonic wave into a nondispersive slab. Phase-dependent phenomena will be investigated through the propagation of a pulse into the same body. During the option period between Phases I and II, we propose to examine an electromagnetic pulse traversing a slab of the same shape but with dispersive properties. Following that, we wil begin a calculation describing a pulse penetrating a finite, irregularly shaped object composed of dispersive material. The work will be continued in Phase II, eventually leading to a set of algorithms to calculate energy deposited in the tissues and organs of the human body.",

        "abstract": "Tailorable Advanced Blanket Insulation (TABI) has been developed as a thermal protection system for future transatmospheric vehicles. TABI is produced in weaving looms at low rates and is very expensive. Foster-Miller proposes an improved textile process for TABI. Two flat braiders simultaneously produce parallel 0@/+0/-0 triaxial flat fabric facesheets. The axial (O@) tows run alternately through both facesheets via synchronized transfer creels. Crossover of axial tows forms the ribs between the facesheets. Ceramic batting insulation can be incorporated into the flutes during braiding. Due to the inherently faster rate of braiding versus weaving, and the elimination of the flute \"stuffing\" operation, this process should lower the cost of TABI. Furthermore, Foster-Miller has developed braiding machinery that has 25X the fiber capacity of current braiders; thus dramatically reducing setup and downtime. Another advantage of braided TABI is that triaxal fabrics are stronger than simple 0/90 wovens. In Phase 1, Foster-Miller will validate the machinery concept to form braided fluted core TABI. The program team includes McDonnell- Douglas (SSTO program), and an expert in commercialization of advanced textiles.

The gas venting from the garment can be used to provide breathing air, while the gas leaving the suit removes CO2 and water vapor from the EMU. If necessary, further CO2 and water removal could be achieved by vaporizing the air prior to entry to CCG, causing the CO2 and water to freeze.

The innovation in the proposed Phase I program is our solution for the prevention of galvanic induced degradation of imide based composites. Our proposed solution involves modifying the BMI resin by placing novel moieties in the polymer chain. The modification to the BMI matrix resin will not compromise its mechanical or thermal properties. We will demonstrate the feasibility of the entire concept by fabricating test coupons, subjecting them to a laboratory galvanic process, and determining the bearing strength of the test coupons. A Phsae II program will develop at the laboratory level modified bismaleimide resins and composites and/or conduct synthesis studies on new resin approaches to meet the requirement for elevated temperature composites at greater 250 degrees F. This Phase II effort will involve a test matrix that demonstrates processing and mechanical properties as well as to compare to baseline materials.",

        "abstract": "The present V-22 canopy frame is made of titanium. Performance advantages of composites are clear but anticipated high manufacturing costs kept composites from being applied to V-22. The size and geometry of the frame is not amenable to traditional hand lay-up of preimpregnated materials. As an alternative, Foster-Miller proposes to braid dry preforms for resin transfer molding (RTM). Our Phase I investigation will concentrate upon establishing a practical, functional design. We will take a balanced approach that builds upon existing braiding technology. We will also investigate the suitability of intersecting and 3D preforms. The cross-sectional size of the canopy is ideal for braiding. The principal challenge facing braiding or any composites fabrication process is to efficiency transfer load at joints. Ideally, fibers should be continuous at intersections. We have produced a +/-45 degree (or other bias) - continuous fiber through the intersection structure. We believe this accomplishment is unique in the industry. As our baseline for the canopy frame we plan a double lap joint configuration. We will also develop two advanced options which will include through-joint fibers. One will be large preform sections that include at least one integral joint. The second will either be a one-piece construction or the lowest number of single preform segments possible. Foster-Miller has developed concepts for this proposal with input from a V-22 prime contractor Boeing Helicopeters. If a Phase I is awarded, Foster-Miller will pursue additional input from Boeing throughout Phase I.",

        "abstract": "Advanced composite materials are increasingly used in wing and fuselage structures. These materials permit a lower part count, weight, and potentially manufacturing and operational costs. These benefits are limited by inherently low damage tolerance and the industry reticence to eliminate excessive riveting. Skin/stiffener constructions are typical of composite airframes. The skin/stiffener joint jas a highly leveraged effect upon airframe const, weight, and performance. Fasteners, localized padups, and other options to improve stiffener attachment performance are currently available. Unfortunately, all of these approaches increase weight and cost. Foster-Miller's z-fiber technology dramatically improves resistance to delamination (Mode 1 fracture toughness, GIC is improved 40X). Z-fibers have also reduced impact damage area and improved stiffener attachment strength. Z-fiber technology is compatible with all contemporary composites materials and manufacturing processes. We propose that z-fiber technology can dramatically improve skin/stiffener performance. Foster-Miller proposes to optiimize the z-fiber skin/stiffener attachment using analysis and test. Lockheed will support our Phase I efforts with data and will review our analyses and conclusions. Our baseline will include Lodkheed's advances in stiffener design.

The application of IMCs to advanced systems is currently limited due to the unavailability of fabrication processes suitable to produce complex shaped parts at an acceptable cost. During Phase I, Foster- Miller will demonstrate the feasibility of an innovative powder metallurgy (P/M) process to fabricate high performance Y-titanium aluminide matrix composites. Major advantages of this process include: . Low processing temperatures (1,600F) which prevents fabrication related fiber and composite degradation. Net-shape fabrication of complex shapes. Versatile in terms of allowable fibers and matrix systems. Well suited for scale-up in part size and production volume. Relatively low materials, tooling and processing costs. Successful implementation of this technology will lead to turbine engines with higher T/W, lower fuel consumption and lower life cycle cost. The Phase I program will identify the process parameters to produce homogeneous 2Nb-2Cr Y-phase matrix and demonstrate superior properties in Y-composite specimens. General Electric and Rocketdyne have indicated a keen interest in working with us to develop and eventually implement this technology in advanced aeroengines. The follow-on Phase II program will demonstrate repeatability of high mechanical properties in optimally processed Y-TiAI composite specimens. Subsequently, a Y-TiAI composite demonstration article will be reactive cast to net-shape and evaluated against the baseline component in terms of performance, weight and cost.",

        "abstract": "Filament wound advanced composite drive shafts provide critical performance at reduced weight for several engine to gearbox connections in the V-22 aircraft system. Recent events have shown that these components may be required to withstand direct flame exposure without loss of structural integrity. Typical epoxy matrix materials will degrade and fail under these conditions. Even metal drive shafts can warp and deform when directly exposed to flame. Simply replacing the epoxy matrix with a \"high temperature\" resin such as BMI or polyimide, does not solve the fire problem. Additionally, these materials raise issues regarding costs processability, and damage tolerance. Foster-Miller, together with team members Bell Helicopter Textron and BP Chemicals, proposes to develop a low cost, lightweight advanced composite drive shaft to function under normal operating conditions while providing for continued operation in the event of fire. To accomplish this we will combine standard drive shaft design congiguration with one of three fire protection schemes which are described in the body of this proposal. Each of these concepts have been proven effective for different applications where fire protection is critical, and offer considerable potential for enhancing fire performance while requiring minimum modifications to the basic drive shaft design.",

The V-22's susceptibility to ice damage is another example of this problem. The current post-buckled design provides the needed lightweight construction but is not sufficient to withstand the impact of the ice shards. Unfortunately, the V-22 is weight critical and beefing up the skin may not be an adequate response as this would cascade through the design. We are proposing to apply technology developed using Navy SBIR funding to demonstrate that a solution to this problem is readily attainable with minimum impact on either the weight or cost of the V-22. Our technology z-fiber reinforcement, has been shown to increase fracture toughness up to 20x in carbon-epoxy, with vitually no adverse impact on in-plane properties, or on current fabrication/tooling approaches applicable to the V-22. Additionally, the z-fiber process has demonstrated a 50% reduction in delamination area in previous hail impact work conducted with Boeing. In Phase I, we will fabricate representative test panels which we will impact with ice shards to quantify the reduction in damage size for a given level of impact. In Phase II additional material property data (fatigue, ETW, etc.) will be developed and a demonstration V-22 stiffened component will be selected and fabricated.",

Fibers intermixed with the soil matrix binds the soil so that it is not affected by the highly erosive winds generated by aircraft as they takeoff and land around the airfields. Soil yarn is applicable to a wide range of soil and soil conditions and as such can be used in almost any environment. Thus it is not subject to the limitations of most soil additives.

This effort will examine the feasibility and utility of Pattern Theory generated vector quantization encoders/decoders. Conventional vector quantization performs a distance calculation to accomplish the encoding process, Pattern Theory could replace this with a much faster look-up table approach. Vector quantization look-up tables using Pattern Theory are developed from training vector examples.

The device selectively limits the level of narrow band high power signals over a relatively wide frequency band without appreciable effect on the weak signals. Thus high dynamic range can be maintained for receiver systems designed to intercept weak signals over a wideband, which otherwise could be masked by the strong signal saturation effects. The operation of the FSL device is based on channeling of the total signal frequency components to sub-bands with subsequent attenuation of the band limited strong signals individually. Due to the frequency separation, weak signals sufficiently separated in frequency from the interfering signals are practically unaffected. Thus the dynamic range of the system is maintained while the weak signals are preserved. Superconductor technology allows devices with high selectivity to be built, as a result of the extremely low loss of circuits using HTS. Low to moderate performance devices can be implemented using conventional technologies albeit with lower selectivity and possibly higher insertion loss.",

SECOND, THE TECHNOLOGICAL AGENDAS FOR RESEARCH LABORATORIES CAN BE VERY DIFFERENT FROM DIAGNOSTIC LABORATORIES; THE FORMER IS CONCERNED WITH DISCOVERY AND TECHNOLOGICAL FLEXIBILITY, AND THE LATTER WITH DEDICATED, AUTOMATED, HIGH-THROUGHPUT SYSTEMS.  THIS PROJECT IS CONCERNED WITH A NOVEL GEL-FREE DETECTION SYSTEM THAT SEEKS TO UNITE SOME OF THE MORE CUMBERSOME DIAGNOSTIC TECHNIQUES INTO A SINGLE, SIMPLE, AUTOMATED INSTRUMENT.

Bias and temperature- dependent S-parameters will be measured for 0.1 micron gate- length InP or GaAs HEMTs on-wafer from 1 to 110GHz and small- and large-signal model parameters for use in computer-aided design programs will be derived. The results will be compared with process and device modeling programs and several problems in mm-wave HEMT process design will be investigated. Anticipated Benefits: The beneficiaries in this effort are the device foundries who are the main users of computer-aided design models for mm- wave design, of the Cascade Microtech on-wafer W-band probes, and of Gateway's process and device modeling programs.

Differences between defense INFOSEC and commercial INFOSEC will be identified first to guide the transfer of defense technologies to commercial applications and the development of interoperability among defense and commercial mails and EDIs. The secure mail and EDI development will be guided also by three evaluation criteria: DoD Rainbow Series, emerging Federal and Common criteria (ECSR for commercial security and LP4).

The putative capsid protein will be expressed in several expression systems alongwith other putative structural proteins of the virus.

A full-length cDNA clone andin vitro-synthesized RNA transcripts of HEV will be tested for their respective abilities to infectsusceptible cells in culture. To confirm in vitro infection, we will examine RNA- and DNA-transfectedcells for the presence of replicative RNA species as well as authentic viral proteins.

Ferrofluids offer a more robust means for coupling electrical inputs to mechanical motion when compared to delicate electrostatically operated microdevices. Recent developments in colloidal ferric particle fabrication have made possible the formulation of transparent ferrofluids and ferrogels which make viable a variety of display applications. During Phase I, the theory of ferrofluid and ferrogel microactuators for use in visual, auditory, and tactile displays will be developed. In addition, samples of ferromagnetic materials will be obtained and evaluated for their utility in microactuator applications. The theory and measurement will be combined to produced designs for devices that will be fabricated and tested during Phase II. These devices will be particularly evaluated for utility in head mounted and portable applications for mobile, active individuals. Successful prototypes tested during Phase II will be the basis of commercial products marketed during Phase III with private funding. Anticipated Benefits: This research should result-in higher performance, more rugged transducers and displays for virtual reality type applications. Another potential application is in providing a visual prosthesis for visually and sensory impaired people.

This technology can be used for the production of fuel cells. CCVD is low cost, high quality and versatile. It does not require a reaction chamber or furnace, yet the thin films produced are comparable in quality to CVD films, and CCVD technology allows substrates to be passed through a deposition zone for multilayered, production line or large area coatings. We have produced CVD quality films of numerous materials using CCVD in the open atmosphere without a furnace or reaction chamber. In this project, thin films of YSZ and doped-LaCrO3 will be grown on to porous La(1-x) SrxMnO3 substrates, and porous YSZ-NiO films will be grown on dense YSZ substrates using CCVD. The stoichiometry, mophology, microstructure, and electrical properties of the films will be determined as a function of deposition conditions. A series of run studies will be performed to optimize the process and demonstrate reproducibility. This research will demonstrate the ability of CCVD to inexpensively deposit high quality thin films for use in high efficiency clean energy fuel cells. Anticipated Benefits: Low cost, high quality YSZ and doped-LaCrO3 films are desired for fuel cells for clean energy production, oxygen sensors and chemical control systems. Possible commercial applications include electrical generation for use in spacecraft, aircraft, ground vehicles, remote applications and eventually most electrical power generation applications.

Thesereagent systems have made identifications and clonings of differentially expressed genes within easyreach for every researcher. The principle of Differential Display is to systematically distribute mRNA 3'termini on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel after RNA-PCR using multiple combinations of anchoredoligo-dT and arbitrary decamers. This Selective Display approach modifies the method by using, insteadof anchored oligo-dT primers, a set of gene family-specific decamers in combinations with arbitrarydecamers to display only those genes of interest. Thus, it complements Differential Display bynarrowing down the scope of a gene search while allowing only the coding regions of mRNAs to bedisplayed.

We will assess the validity and feasibility of using theenzyme telomerase as an innovative target to develop a mechanism-of-action-based drug discoveryeffort. The concept that telomerase is unique and essential for immortality in tumor cells was pioneeredby heron's scientists and advisors. In normal somatic cells, telomerase is absent and telomeres, theends of chromosomes, gradually shorten, ultimately causing permanent cell-cycle arrest. Most malignantcells, however, maintain short, stable telomeres through the activation of telomerase, the enzyme whichsynthesizes telomeric DNA. Thus, we will survey a wide variety of normal and malignant tissues andcell lines for telomere length and expression of telomerase. We will then develop an automatedhigh-throughput screen to identify inhibitors of telomerase from a number of large and structurallydiverse compound libraries. Active compounds will be selected for further analysis and ultimately clinicaldevelopment.",

The objective similar to the case of database views which is to allow the extension and reorganization of a model without affecting the original model. A simulation view is an analysis tool that can abstract not only the structure of a group of models but the behavior as well. Views that abstract structure allow the aggregation of the state of its components. Objects in a simulation generate low level performance measures of the behavior of the system, structural views allow the analyst to derive more complex performance measures a combination of existing ones. The goal of the SEVMAT project is to test an existing simulation environment prototype that supports views using the project management network problem as the application domain. This project will allow NASA to use simulation as a decision tool in the area of resource allocation and the analysis of results on multiple criteria simultaneously. Using the results of the experiment, requirements for converting the idea into a commercial product can be identified and a detailed design of the analysis tool achieved.",

        "abstract": "The fuel cell system receiving significant attention for transportation applications is the proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) which uses a hydrated sheet of a perfluorinated ion-exchange membrane as a solid electrolyte in the fuel cell. The liquid feed direct methanol PEMFC, because of its simplicity (no reformer, simple heat management) and inherent reliability (ionomer membrane flooded with water), is a potentially attractive power source for vehicles and other low-to medium-power applicatoins, in both the commercial and military sectors. One drawback to direct methanol PEMFCs is that the methanol permeates across currently available PEM electrolytes from the anode to the cathode where it reacts with air (O2), resulting in parasitic loss of methanol and reduced fuel cell voltage. To overcome this problem, development of an efficient unitized composite PEM containing an integral, thin low-water-content surface ionomer film bonded to standard Nafion 117 membrane is proposed. This structure is expected to minimize methanol permeability while maintaining high proton transport, leading to increased fuel cell power output and improved system efficiency. Anticipated Benefits: Vehicles powered by direct methanol fuel cells have the potential for a very large market in California, the New England states, and other states in the Northeast that have mandated the introduction of zero-emission vehicles by the end of the decade. Another potential commercial application is dispersed power generators. Military applications include standard vehicles, unmanned underwater and air vehicles, and person portable back-pack power supplies.",

We have discovered thatAbeta specifically binds complement component C1q and activates the classical complement cascade.Our intent is to characterize the Abeta-C1q molecular association such that specific inhibitors of thisinteraction can be developed as potential therapeutic agents. We will (1) identify the binding sites onAbeta that interact with C1q through the use of synthetic Abeta fragments in a C1q binding assay, (2)determine whether Abeta and fragments of amyloid bind C1q at the same site as the normal complementactivator, immunoglobulin. This will be accomplished by testing the ability of the peptides to competewith munoglobulin for C1q binding; and (3) develop prototype compounds that will specifically inhibitcomplement activation by Abeta without disrupting immunoglobulin-mediated complement activation.The further elucidation of the specific interactions resulting in complement activation by Abeta and thedevelopment of prototype inhibitors to prevent this activation could lead to the identification oftherapeutic agents to slow the progression of AD.",

        "abstract": "Passive sonar systems will not be able to detect and/or classify the quiet targets of the future. Low transmit frequencies are needed to image, and hence classify, these targets at long ranges using active sonar. The low frequency sonar arrays have to be large in order to attain the angular resolution needed to image submarines at long ranges. Inhomogeneity of the propagation medium in the huge volume of water surrounding the large array creates phase errors. Additional phase errors occur because such large arrays cannot be surveyed accurately. Cost considerations dictate that the large array be thinned: this leads to high sidelobes that create image artifacts. A phenomenon called speckle causes target break-up, further reducing the likelihood of target classification. This proposed effort will develop algorithms to solve these problems associated with imaging using large and distorted low-frequency active sonar arrays. Phase errors caused by medium inhomogeneity and inaccurate element location estimates are compensated using self-cohering and self-survey algorithms. A deconvolution technique called CLEAN, initially developed in radio astronomy and later applied in coherent microwave imaging, will be used to suppress image artifacts caused by speckle and the high sidelobes of the thinned receiving array.",

THE TECHNIQUE CAN BE APPLIED FOR EITHER CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION (CVD) OR BY RAPID THERMAL PROCESSING (RTP) SYSTEMS.  THE METHOD IS BASED ON THERMAL EXPANSION OF A SEMICONDUCTOR WAFER, AND USES SPECKLE PATTERNS GENERATED FROM THE BACK (ROUGH SURFACE) OF THE WAFER.  SPECKLE PATTERNS ARE GENERATED BY COHERENT ILLUMINATION BY TWO SYMMETRICALLY INCIDENT LASER BEAMS.  SPECKLE PATTERNS ARE RECORDED AT VARIOUS TEMPERATURES AND SUBTRACTED FROM AN INITIAL FRAME STORED AT A KNOWN TEMPERATURE.  SPECKLE CORRELATION FRINGES PRODUCED BY THIS ELECTRONIC SUBTRACTION PROCESS (ESPI) REPRESENT CONTOURS OF EQUAL DISPLACEMENT.  FOR 6.0 MM WIDE ILLUMINATION REGION, A TEMPERATURE SENSITIVITY OF APPROXIMATELY 30-DEGREE/FRINGE IS OBSERVED.  SPECKLE DECORRELATION TAKES PLACE AS THE NUMBER OF FRINGES APPROACHES TYPICAL SPECKLE SIZE.  SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO OF THE SPECKLE FRINGES IS IMPROVED BY INCORPORATING SINGLE-STEP PHASE SHIFT IN THE DATA ACQUISITION AND PROCESSING SYSTEM.  TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENTS UP TO 400 DEGREES ARE DEMONSTRATED WITH A SINGLE REFERENCE STORED FRAME.  FAST FOURIER TRANSFORM (FFT) OF SPECKLE FRINGE PATTERNS IS APPLIED FOR CALCULATION OF SPECKLE FRINGE PERIOD TO EXTRACT TEMPERATURE INFORMATION.  A DETAILED INVESTIGATION OF THESE TECHNIQUES IS PROPOSED FOR SPECKLE TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENTS UP TO 1000 DEGREES.",

THIS IS OF SPECIAL CONCERN IN CERTAIN COASTAL AREAS, AS WELL AS THE GREAT LAKES.  AN ALTERNATIVE TO CHEMICAL TREATMENT METHODS, WHICH PRODUCE A RESIDUE FOR DISPOSAL, IS A BIOLOGICAL PHOSPHORUS REMOVAL TREATMENT PROCESS.  THE SUCCESS AND RELIABILITY OF THE BIOLOGICAL PROCESS DEPEND ON THE ABILITY TO PRODUCE A FERMENTATION PRODUCT FROM THE WASTEWATER; NAMELY ACETATE AND PROPIONATE.  PRIMARY TREATMENT SLUDGE IS FERMENTED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ACETATE, BUT WHERE THIS HAS BEEN USED, THE ACETATE PRODUCTION HAS BEEN BELOW THEORETICAL EXPECTATIONS.  THIS MAY BE DUE TO THE GROWTH OF OTHER SULFATE REDUCING AND METHANE FORMING ORGANISMS THAT CONSUME THE ACETATE.  A PRIMARY SLUDGE FERMENTATION SYSTEM THAT USES INTERMITTENT OXYGENATION TO INHIBIT THE ORGANISMS AND THUS GREATLY INCREASE THE FERMENTATION YIELD IS BEING DEVELOPED.

The innovation lies in combining these two types of polymers to make a single sensor which will provide a minimal intrusion method for measuring pressure distributions on structures in free-flight and/or wind tunnel tests. Spatial resolution should be better than 1 mm. Response times could be as short as 1 \u00bfs. Power consumption could be as low as a few Wm-2. The project objectives are to show that the device can be fabricated, to show that it functions as anticipated, and to develop a conceptual design for a sensor to be demonstrated in wind tunnel tests. The effort proposed is about 6 man months including subcontractors (for device fabrication) and a consultant (in design and applications). We anticipate that the objectives will be met and that a demonstration in a wind tunnel will be possible in Phase II. Phase III would include manufacturing of sensors for use in NASA aerodynamic testing. These sensors will improve understanding of flow features and will lead to design of more capable and/or more efficient subsonic aircraft.",

Receptors not only provide this recognition mechanism, but also make possible generic detection, for example, neurotoxins can be recognized by a representative array of human neuroreceptors. A serious drawback with using receptors is that many receptors have not yet been identified, and therefore generic detection of analytes binding to these receptors cannot be achieved. Combinatorial methods offer a means of creating and screening a wide diversity of molecules with the goal of finding a particular molecule with the desired tailored properties. We propose to use a combinatorial method (called PROLAPS) to find peptides that mimic receptors (called mimotopes). PROLAPS offers the additional capability of building arrays of mimotopes that can be directly used as the sensing element, and of ultimately being completely automated, so that searching for new mimotopes will be a technique readily available to most researchers.",

Submicroscanning sensor performance will be comparable to that obtained with conventional microscanning, but with less weight and mechanical complexity. Building on the results of an initial proof-of-principle demonstration of the submicroscanning technique performed at Wright Laboratory, WPAFB, we propose to further investigate the capabilities of nonmechanical submicroscanning and examine specific design issues regarding image shift versus image quality, spatial noise performance, and material considerations. Use of nonmechanical submicroscanning for point-target tracking will also be investigated.

For purposes ofmonitoring the safety, efficacy and long-term effects of such therapies, there exist a number ofcommercially available assays to assess the progression of the procoagulant and fibrinolytic responses.For example, to monitor the procoagulant response, there exists: a) an assay for fragment 1-2 ofprothrombin to monitor prothrombinase activity; and b) an assay for fibrinopeptide-A to monitor thrombinactivity. The same holds true for the fibrinolytic response where assays for D-Dimer and FDP fragmentsof fibrin and fibrinogen respectively may be used to monitor the activity of plasmin. Unfortunately, ananalogous assay to measure the progression of the anti-anticoagulant response does not exist. Webelieve that an assay to measure the in vivo activity of APC, by measuring the APC catalyzedinactivation of factor Va will provide a direct measure of the anticoagulant response.

Deficiency in either of these proteins is associated with severe bleeding disorders, hemophiliaand para-hemophilia. Deficiency states of these proteins can be caused by their proteolytic inactivationby Activated Protein C (APC), a natural anticoagulant enzyme. Therapeutic intervention in hemophilia-Athrough the use of replacement plasma factor VIII is a standard measure to control bleeding. It is logicalto expect that selective inhibitors of APC might improve the efficacy of factor VIII replacement therapyby reducing the losses of Factor VIlla to APC cleavage. Inhibitors of APC which express reasonableaffinity and high specificity have not been reported. Recent identification of the cleavage sites of FactorsVa and VIlla by APC have led-to the development of synthetic peptide inhibitors with affinity for APC.These inhibitors did not inhibit thrombin and showed very low affinity for Factor Xa, raising thepossibility that such inhibitors might selectively neutralize the anticoagulant effect of APc. Factor VIIIreplacement therapy is a 300 million dollar per year business in the United States alone. It is conceivablethat by improving the prophylactic effect of this replacement therapy and/or alleviating the need for suchtherapy in border-line cases, as much as 100 million dollars per year could be saved in health care costswithin the United States.

It is estimated that more than 100 million people in the tropics are infected annually by thisvirus. This threat has now reached the southern United States with the arrival of the Aedes albopictusmosquito vector. Attempts to develop live attenuated dengue vaccines analogous to the yellow fevervaccine have yet to be successful. The proposal research is directed toward development of a definedsubunit dengue vaccine using yeast virus-like particles (VLPs) fused to peptides of the dengue envelope(E) glycoprotein. Such self-assembling VLPs are comprised of the protein product, p1, of the TYA geneof the yeast transposable element Ty. Fusion of dengue E cDNA fragments to the TYa gene will producep1-dengue fusion proteins. The resulting hybrid VLPs will require a single ultracentrifugation step forpurification and should present epitopes in a highly immunogenic form. During phase I, the feasibility ofthis approach will be tested by constructing a yeast TYA:dengue envelope peptide fusion gene andtesting expression, formation of hybrid VLPs, and immunoreactivity of the hybrid VLPs.",

Protein stability is a major criteria for sensors devoted to long-term monitoring. The enzyme label is typically the most unstable componenet in biosensors. Additional problems encountered with immunobiosensors include diffusional limitations and reversibility. The research proposed in this grant application will address these problems by studying the applications of microperoxidase as a catalytic label for two toxin monoclonal antibodies. Such studies will involve the preparation and characterization of three forms of microperoxidase. The microperoxidase will be conjugated to antibodies through several specific methods; resulting conjugates will be tested with regard to several fundamental criteria, including stability. A prototype toxin biosensor will be created and the resulting conjugates will be tested for their ability to detect toxins. These studies should provide the foundation for Phase II research which will further improve the characteristics of the conjugates and develop a portable biosensor for field use.",

The hypothesis to be testedis that continuous wave infrared laser radiation can produce controlled heat shrinkage of collagen fibersin the cornea for correction of refractive errors, with greater long term predictability than pulsed laserssuch as the Ho:YAG. The new infrared laser will be tuned to wavelength allowing delivery ofnon-coagulating heat to stromal tissue, while minimizing heating of Bowman's and Descemet's layersand the corneal endothelium. A modulated delivery system will deliver power in a ring-shaped patternto correct hyperopic refractive errors, or vary power delivery to selected areas of the corneal to correctastigmatism. Preliminary experiments in this laboratory indicate that myopic correction may also beachieved. Experiments in live animals will determine long-term beneficial and adverse effects. The longterm objective of this research plan is the development of a compact commercial laser device providinga low risk alternative to radial keratotomy and photo refractive keratotomy by avoiding scarring orirregularity of the optical zone.",

Waste heat recovery from the Hybrid engine with thermoelectric energy conversion can probably increase the engine efficiency by ~5% with present thermoelectric materials. Much higher conversion efficiencies probably can be realized if newer materials were developed. Hi-Z has recently generated data with some metal silicides that show much higher figures of merit (Z) than previously reported. Further experimental studies and theoretical modeling of these promising silicides is required to understand their unique behavior. This innovative effort should yield more efficient alloys that will further insure the success of the Hybrid engine and the electric vehicle. Hi-Z has teamed with Lawrence Livermore National Labs (LLNL) to develop these promising materials. Hi-Z will be concentrating on the preparation and characterization of these alloys while LLNL will provide the theoretical modeling and analytical services. In a related proposal. Hi-Z has teamed with Sundstrand to develop a waste heat recovery generator for their small turbine engine. Sunstrand is developing this Hybrid engine for Ford. Anticipated Beneftis: The Hybrid electric car will sharply reduce the pollutants being generated in our cities.

Both the transponder and the interrogator will be built in MMIC chips for low cost and small size. The interrogator function on munitions may be built into a transmittor available on board. The transponer, built in a miniature package using MMIC chips, can be hand-carrier or mounted on any combat vehicle. To realize the full potential of the MMIC technology, it is necessary to develop MMIC compatible circuit technologies for non-reciprocal circuit functions. Based on demonstrated capabilities of active MMIC circulators operating in microwave frequencies, Hittite proposes to extend its design capabilities up to K and Ka-band frequencies. Availbility of MMIC circulators will lead to a higher scale of integration with attendant size/weight reduction and reliability improvement for the total RF equipment.",

The A/D converter design will be implemented in GaAs with a new design of high-speed comparator integrated with other standard digital circuit cells available at GaAs foundries.

Proprietary dielectric compositions and innovative processingtechniques will be used. In Phase I, small scale capacitors will be produced with full scale capacitorsbeing produced in Phase II. The research effort will investigate a composition found to be favorable inprevious work. Processing conditions, capacitor design, and proper termination procedures will beinvestigated. The successful implementation of this technology will result in significantly smallercapacitors than are currently being used. Since the capacitors occupy a significant amount of the spacein an implantable defibrillator, much smaller devices, closer in size to pacemakers, will be able to beconstructed. Pectoral area implantation of a small device will lead to more patient acceptance of thislife-saving therapy. Other advantages of solid state ceramic capacitors over the electrolytic capacitors,which are the current state-of-the-art, include improved reliability, since there is no corrosive electrolytewith the potential for leakage. Ceramic capacitors can be readily shaped to conform to the case shapeof the defibrillator; they have extremely low current leakage and do not require periodic reforming of thedielectric oxide.",

To utilize all available information, all operations involved in the sensor integration such as contour extraction, image registration, data fusion, clutter elimination, and target recognition are carried out at multiple resolution levels based on wavelet transforms. This leads to an increased ability to discrimanate targets and an increase in robustness due to redundance of information obtained. Unlike existing wavelet based approaches, this new approach computes the wavelet transform for each sensor image only once. Therefore, it provides not only computational efficiency but also a great degreee of robustness. It will be highly effective for identifying targets in rich clutter environment.",

Theyexhibit potent binding activity at mu specific opioid receptors, with approximately a 10-fold loweractivity at delta, and greater than 100-fold less binding activity at kappa-1 and kappa-2 receptors. Theyhave been found to be potent mu receptor antagonists in the guinea pig ileum assay, and relatively weakdelta antagonists in the mouse vas deferens assay. In order to increase the mu receptor specificity, thisstudy will involve the synthesis of 240 single position analogs of the most potent L- and D-amino acidacetalins (Ac-RFMWMR-NH2 and Ac-rfwink-NH2, respectively). The goal is to develop a highly muspecific receptor antagonist which is not broken down by proteolytic enzymes. The most specific muantagonists will be tested for their ability to antagonize the intestinal immobility caused by chronicmorphine treatment. The long term goal is to be able to block the deleterious effects of intestinalimmobility (constipation) in patients requiring long term morphine treatment.",

        "abstract": "Liquid rocket engine systems currently in development or being considered for future development will require a variety of liquid propulsion subsystems for axial, reaction control, target intercept, and auxiliary propulsion. Many of these proposed systems are critically dependent on the development of advanced high-temperature materials for specific propulsion sub-systems. Thrust chambers/nozzles currently being produced are typically fabricated from various refractory metals and refractory metal alloys. Although refractory metal materials have proved to be highly reliable, they are extremely weight-inefficient due to their high density and low specific mechanical properties. Recent developments in light-weight, high-temperature ceramic-matrix composites (CMCs) offer promise to increase both performance and efficiency over currently available propulsion materials. Current state-of the-art CMCs are being fabricated by methods of conventional chemical vapor infiltration (CVI). Conventional, isothermal/isobaric CVI techniques require intentionally slow deposition rates in order to uniformly infiltrate and densify the continuous fiber preforms while minimizing through-the-thickness density gradients. These slow CVI densification processes routinely require 300-400 hours to complete, resulting in very long product lead times and thus relatively high product cost. The objective of this Phase I program is to develop and evaluate an innovative forced flow CVI process for the rapid densification of carbon fiber-reinforced silicon carbide-matrix (C/SiC) composite rocket nozzles. The goal of this development is to successfully reduce the densification cycle by at least 75%, resulting in a composite nozzle fabrication cost reduction of over 50%. Triaxially braided, multilayer carbon fiber performs will be fabricated over geometrically contoured mandrels and rapidly densified with SiC using an economical forced flow CVI technique. Process conditions will be established for densifying the nozzle components to a minimum target density of 2.3 gm/cm3 (88% theoretical) inless than 100 hours.

The development of these detectors represents an innovation in X-ray detectors because of their light weight and high energy resolution, making them ideal for use on spaced based platforms. Furthermore, thin film STJ X-ray detectors will have important commercial applications in X-ray spectrometers on electron microprobe instruments, for elemental compositional analysis of specimens through energy dispersive X-ray methods.

This superconductive converter has been tested at input bandwidths up to 18GHz but the requirement for refrigeration to 4.2 degrees Kelvin limits the number of applications due to the size, weight, cost and reliability of the refrigerator. If comparable performance could be achieved at temperatures -10 times higher, the cooling requirement would become easily manageable in many situations. Small, cheap, and reliable refrigerators exist at these temperatures. This is the cause of much excitement about high temperature superconductors. Thin films and Josephson junctions have been fabricated from high temperature superconductors for electronic applications. We propose to design, fabricate, and test an Yttrium Barium Copper Oxide (YBCO, a high temperature superconductor) circuit which forms the heart of an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The ADC design will be fabricated by the Westinghouse Science and Technology Center. Evaluation of this circuit should allow us to project the dynamic range, linearity, and noise performance of a full ADC. This feasibility study could ultimately lead to very low power, high speed ADC's which are the bottleneck in many signal processing and communications systems.",

This energy is released when the carbon-hydrogen fuel mixture is burned in a rocket engine increasing the specific impulse of the fuel. The task of producing high energy density fueld is frustrated by the lack of a high flux source of gas phase carbon atoms having adequate purity (99%) that is both compatible with cryogenic trapping requirements and is economical for commercial applications. Thermal evaporation or laser ablation sources do not meet these cryogenic and economic requirements, respectively. HY-Tech proposes to build a plasma discharge source utilizing a metal vapor vacuum arc (MEVVA) to generate a pure carbon plasma that is confined and guided to a biased electrode where the ions are recombined through an Auger tunneling process. Incorporating an electrode avoids the cryogenic problems that would arise if a conventional neutralizing gas cell was used. The mass of carbon atoms per unit of charge transfer in the arc will be determined for designing the Phase II system. Estimates indicate that the required flux of 0.21 g/hr can be generated at an average power consumption of 0.8 to 1 kw of electrical energy.",

In the case of arrhythmias, thesemeasures require the development of sensors and microprocessors controlling appropriate pacing action.such an artificial pacemaker should have commercial value at least on a par with that of the mostsophisticated existing devices. Phase l is to consolidate current understanding of arrhythmia intocomputer software (and possibly a 'hard-wired' device) that mimics the underlying electrophysiology asclosely as possible. Schemes for appropriate pacing devices will then be tested on these simulations.This should set the stage for Phase II, in which actual devices will be constructed and tested.",

        "abstract": "Although it is well established that many medical conditions occurring in postmenopausal womenare related to changes that have occurred in levels of reproductive hormones, especially estrogen, thedetails of the relationships between the levels of these hormones in symptomatic as compared tonon-symptomatic women are not well understood. Similarly, there is little understanding of thephysiological basis for side affects, reduced tolerance and noncompliance associated with hormonereplacement therapy. A factor in this lack of understanding is the cost of assaying these hormones,which has kept them from being routinely monitored as a woman passes her reproductive phases. Wewill address this situation by developing a relatively low cost fiber optic sensor that will simultaneouslymeasure estradiol, progesterone, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) inserum. The instrument will be designed for use in the physician's office and will provide results at leastcomparable to those obtained from clinical assay within minutes. During phase I, we will examine thefeasibility of combining the sensitivity of time resolved fluorescence assay using lanthanide chelates(that have been used in assays that have achieved sensitivity at the level of attamoles, 1 x 10 (-18)moles) with the speed and simplicity of a fiber optic biosensor.",

        "abstract": "Significant improvements must be made in the ability of the health care system to deliver cost effective health care services. A recent Institute of Medicine study identified the development of computer-based patient record systems as being the essential technology which must be developed for controlling health care costs and providing quality care. A computer system for acquiring, displaying and storing patient medical records would lower the ocst of administering patient records, improve the ability of care providers to deliver patient care, and simplify claims submittal to insurance carriers. By recomending the scheduling of appropriate prevention care, the need for crisis medical intervention would be decreased, patient health care would be improved, and long term patient care costs decreased. To achieve these goals, Innovation Associates proposes to develop a Prevention Care Recommendation System (PreCare), which utilizes hand-held tablet computers for acquiring and displaying patient medical records and appropriate prevention care recommendations of Healthy People 2000. Medical records will be sotred on a network accessible, computer medical record repository deisgned for maintaining medical reord confidentiality for patient medical records. PreCare will be implemented in stages supporting prevention care, general care, secondary care, laboratory results, prescriptions and insurance billing. Anticipated Benefits: The PreCare medical record system will find a large commercial market in organizations which must acquire and manage patient medical records. By providing netowrk accessible Medical Record Repository, patient records will be interchanged more cost effectively between primary and secondary care providers, clinics, clinical laboratories and hospitals. By providing electronic access to patient records, the cost of submitting claims to insurance carriers will be reduced.",

Coaxial lines are used to reduce the external magnetic fields to the transmission lines, and reduce ship magnetic signature. Flexible couplings must be used with coaxial lines to account for environmental factors such as hull contractions and expansion, and to withstand the navy environment shich includes shock and vibration. Development of a flexible coupling is important to future application of coaxial transmission. We propose to develop a passively cooled, cable based flexibe coupling for coaxial transmission line that is cost effective, easy to fabricate, install, and maintain. The flexible coupling will be designed with readily available components to minimize the cost of production. The interface of the coupling with the transmission line will be designed with readily available components to minimize the cost of production. The interface of the coupling with the transmission line will be designed such that it does not require modifications to exiting coaxial designs. This reduces the cost impact of implementation permitting rapid testing on Navy test facility. Our Phase I effort will result in a detail design of the flexible coupling. The detail design will include a complete set of fabrication drawings and a design report. In Phase II, we will build a prototype and test it at a Navy facility. The design will then be updated and a complete set of production drawings generated.",

This is especially true for low ductility classes of materials such as intermetallics and low ductility metals like tungsten and titanium. Rolling processess for these metals generally result in very low yields. IAP Research proposes the development of a sheet forming process which exploits the electroplastic effect present in metallic materials when an electric current is applied under stress. The increased dislocation mobility leads to higher plasticity in forming processes. This leads to higher yield rates, and reduced energy processing costs. Anticipated Benefits: We anticipate that successfully demonstrating the feasibility of using the electroplastic effect in a rolling operation will lead to the development of a pilot scale facility. This technique has application in other metal forming operations such as extrusion and drawing of low ductility materials.",

Advances in SIMOX semiconductor fabrication technology include radiation hardened memories and gate arrays for space applications, ULSI DRAMs for low voltage operation, thin film SOI BiCMOS for low power circuitry, and extreme (400 degrees C) temperature aplications of SIMOX circuitry. Recent studies have brought attention to the role of the device silicon dislocations in gate oxide reliability and integrity. As such, a significant issue in the manufacturing of SIMOX substrates for advanced electronics is the ability to ascertain, in real time, the presence and statistical analysis of dislocations present in the active silicon layer prior to complete wafer fabrication and customer shipment. Commercially available systems for automatic defect counting are not sensitive to the type and wide range (1E3 to 1E8/cm squared) of scale for the thin silicon film etch pits which can be optically observed. An opportunity is presented for the development of a commercially available, in-line, intelligent dislocation analysis system using neural network information processing and state-of-the-art imaging.

Human monoclonal antibodies would likely be superior to murineantibodies in such protocols, because they have efficient effector functions and reduced side effects.To generate these antibodies, we will use a unique protocol developed in our laboratory that was provenefficient for the production of high affinity monoclonal IgG antibodies from naive human splenocytes;an initial in vitro immunization step resulting in a primary response is followed by a transfer of thestimulated cells in SCID mice and in vivo antigen boost. The antibody titers in the serum of the SCID-huare several orders of magnitude higher than what has been reported in the literature. Competent cellsare rescued from the animals and immortalized by somatic fusion and/or EBV transformation.Monoclonal antibodies are selected for adequate affinity, specificity and physiological activity.",

The objective of this proposal is to combine prominent personnel with appropriate funding from the federal goverment and specifically identify and measure the independent variables associated with low-frequency job time performance. This will be achieved through direct observations and measurements of low- frequency industrial and government activities, conscientious statistical analysis, and foregoing software development. It is anticipated that Phase I of this project will secure preliminary statistical data of the variable evaluations, prevalent flow documentation of standards generations, and a precursory framework of the specific software model.

All photogrammetric functions would be off loaded to this coprocessor. The main technical objective of the Phase 1 research and development effort will be to design this photogrammetric coprocessor using state of the art Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) and Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) technologies and devices. Phase 2 R&D will be the actual development of the photogrammetric coprocessor and the incorporation of this coprocessor into an on board megapixel interactive image processing prototype.

The company has already fabricated GMR films, which exhibited GMR a factor of 10 or more higher than anisotropic magnetoresistance values. If the new technologies can be successfully applied to the PRAM fabrication process, then the whole memory, selection electronics and all, will be deposited on the same substrate at the same time, with no added deposition steps or processes. The result will be a compact (10 Gbit/cm2 to 1 Tbit/CM2), fast (10 ns), inexpensive, random-access, quickly alterable,, rugged, nonvolatile memory.

A novel, low temperature ion beam induced chemical vapor deposition (IICVD) process will be used to deposit smooth, high purity, nanocrystalline SiC coatings at ambient temperatures. The low process temperature reduces residual stress, grain growth and contamination - problems experienced with conventional, high temperature CVD. To promote adhesion, a functionallly graded Cu-SiC layer will be interposed between coating and substrate by co-evaporation of Cu during initial stages of SiC deposition. The SiC coating will be characterized in terms of its thickness, smoothness, hardness, impurity content, crystal structure, microstructure, continuity, adhesion, electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity, oxidation resistance and structural integrity under high heat flux loads. The compositional gradient and thickness of the blended layer also will be determined. Based on these measurements, optimum processing conditions and properties will be defined.

Presen brush seals are expensive and do experience seal and bristle wear especially at high operating temperatures. Implant Sciences proposes to develop and test new hard coatings for the reduction of seal wear. These new coatings consisting of amorphous diamond and silicon carbide will be applied by a new lower-cost fabrication technique utilizing a filtered cathodic arc system. The coatings will be evaluated with respect to friction and wear using a pin-on-disk test rig which will be modified to operate at 750 degrees C and surface speeds up to 900 ft/sec. Cyclic oxidation tests will also be performed on coated rotor material.",

        "abstract": "We propose to study and simulate an innovative approach to ultrasound imaging for medical diagnostics. It is based on the spatial encoding of broad beam continuous wave echo returns rather than traditional pulsed echo techniques. This new technology promises to significantly improve the ability of physicians to diagnose ailments while lowering testing costs. By extracting a frequency encoded signature from each imaged point with a matched filter corresponding to the points 3-D location, the system carefully sidesteps most of the militations of current ultra-sound systems. Objects significantly less than 1mm in size can be imaged as the system is not limited by beam forming ability. Using a continuous wave signal, a wide bandwidth return, and a lower average frequency the system offers greater depth penetration and improved tissue contrast. The volumetric nature of the technology allows the system operator to directly control a variety of real-time 3-D and 2-D imaging modes for unparalleled flexibility. Anticipated Benefits: The proposed sensor technology should see widespred use since it offers image quality comparable to MRI and CATSCAN modalities with the flexibility and low cost of ultrasound. The system could also significantly improve battlefield daignostics by providing a complete noninvasive imaging system that is portable, easy-to-use and effective for most battlefield injuries.",

        "abstract": "An EMAT (electromagnetic acoustic transmission) system is currently installed at Watervliet Arsenal where it is used for the relatively simple task of wall thickness measurements. Since this system was designed several years agao, the general capability of EMAT systems has advanced to the point where it is now practical to consider developing an EMAT system for the non-destructive inspection of cannon preforms and tubes. Although it is now generally understood how a flaw detection EMAT system should be designed, there are a few questions related to forged cannon tubes and preforms that must be answered before an EMAT sytem for this inspection task can be designed. Foremost among these questions are what wave mode and operating frequency should be used when one wishes to couple ultrasound through the rough forged surface. Phase I proposes to use an ISA portable EMAT measurement system to perform a series of measurements on cannon preforms and tubes with forged and machined surfaces at an Army facility. Based upon the results of these tests and discussions with Army personnel regarding the stages in cannon tube manufacturing where inspection can or should be performed, Phase II will design, build, install and evaluate an exploratory development EMAT system at an Army facilitye. There is also the possibility of using our Phase I measurements to design, build and evaluate an EMAT system that will eventually be capable of operating on surfaces as hot at 750 degrees C. Phase II includes support to monitor the first year of installed use so that necessary modifications and improvements that become apparent through use can be made. Performance experience with these designs will determine the specifications that can be realized in the commercial and DoD Phase III activities.",

The porposed interdisciplinary study should lead to a better understanding and design of optimum and economical processes for ceramic and glass matrix composites. The primary thrust would be to formulate a viscoelastic mathematical model for a ceramic matrix undergoing pressureless or pressure assisted densification. A robust and efficient non-linear finite element code will be developed to solve for full field variables such as density, stress and damage. Simple geometries such as particulate, whisker and unidirectional composites will be considered during the Phase I while laminated angle-ply, cross-ply and microcomposites will be considered during Phase II.

        "abstract": "Technology development is proposed for an air-delivered submunition employing a rotary wing to provide a large footprint with minimal burden in cost and complexity. With the rotary wing in autorotation, the submunition scans a circular area while in controlled vertical descent. When the sensor, which is mounted on the rotor mast, detects a target, cyclic rotor pitch control is introduced, causing the submunition to glide down a flight path which passes over the target at a prescribed altitude. The primary concerns in implementing the concept center on stability and control. Angular rate feedback is required for stable vertical descent and velocity feedback is needed to command a lateral maneuver. Feasibility will be demonstrated during Phase I by laying out a preliminary mechanical design, generating a detailed simulation model which includes all critical guidance and control elements and conducting simulations which quantify design requirements for the instrumentation and servo controls as well as delineate the performance capabilities of a rotary-wing submunition. The desion generated in Phase I will provide the basis for conducting demonstration flight tests in Phase II. '.",

Serum urea level along with serum creatinine level arefrequently used for the evaluation of renal function, since the levels of these two waste products helpin the differential diagnosis of pre-renal, renal and post-renal hyperuremia. Presently there is nocreatinine analyzer that can handle whole blood. The laboratory turn around time may range from 15-90min even for a simple electrolyte analysis, which is not acceptable for treatment of acute renal failures.The applicants believe that the development of a suitable creatinine sensor that can be integrated intoexisting blood gas/electrolyte analyzers is a significant technological innovation with a potentially largecommercial application.

The requirements on such protective gear are very stringent. Gloves in particular, must meet not only the protective barrier specifications, but at the same time allow the defense personnel to oeprate various equipment with sufficient dexterity. It appears that of the several protective glove materials that are available commercially, only butyl rubber gloves offer the best protection agains HD, GB and GD agents. However, butyl rubber's mechanical properties at the thicknesses used in CP gloves are not the most desirable. Materials that exhibit excellent mechanical properties such s silicone rubber, are found to be poor in terms of barrier properties. In this work, polymers with excellent barrier properties will be surface grafted as a thin layer onto a substrate with good mechanical properties. Several commercially available gloves will be surface grafted with the desirable polymers using two gas phase and a solution phase grafting techniques. The resulting grafts will be tested for their breakthrough times using appropriate simulants. Stress-strain curves will also be measured to monitor any changes in mechanical properties.",

        "abstract": "This project will explore the feasibility of using a complex inorganic salt as a primary photodetonator in the development of a photoinitiated explosive. Photodentonation has been observed in a perchlorate salt of a transition metal complex. This salt is not a conventional shock detonator, and so may represent the first case of atrue photodetonator. The potential importance of complex inorganic photodetonators to the development of a photoinitiated explosive is twofold. First, the photosensitizer and detonator are contained within a single crystalline structure rather than in a heterogeneous material. Second, many synthetic routes are available for optimization by variation of the metal ion, ligands, or counterions. In Phase I, criteria will be established to judge the performance of different complex inorganic materials for explosives development. The original complex inorganic photodetonator will be studied in order to identify crystalline and electronic structuralfactors that are critical to its photodetonation. Other potential detonator salts will be identified through a literature survey. Synthetic routes to optimal materials will be proposed. Finally, experiments will be designed for Phase II testing of the feasibility of photoinitiated detonatio, including the optical characterizatin of photodetonator materials, quantitative comparison of standardized photodetonator systems, and field testing of prototype devices.",

        "abstract": "ZnGeP2 single cyrstals have outstanding nonlinear and optical properties that make them the most attractive candidate for optical parametric oscillators (OPO) and amplifiers (OPA) capable of producing tunable laser radiation in the 2.5 to 13 micron region. The development of ZnGeP2-based devices has been hampered by existing synthesis and crystal growth methods that are not now capable of providing crystals of the required size and quality, including low absorption between 1 and 3 microns. The principle objective of this program is to develop a cost effective process for the growth of uniform, high quality ZnGeP2 single crystals with low optical absorption in the 2 micron region. We propose to use a novel technique to produce highly transparent ZnGeP2 single crystals suitable for OPO and OPA applications. As feed stock for the crystal growth process, we plan to use a new synthesis technique developed at INRAD which can produce large quantities of ZnGeP2 of controlled stoichiometry.",

Current therapies canstabilize bone mass but can not repair or restore lost bone. Thus, a critical need exists to improvetherapeutics for the treatment of osteoporosis. Growth factors are essential for bone repair, andexogenous growth factors can augment bone formation. We have demonstrated that the combinationof platelet-derived growth factor (pDGF) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) can dramatically stimulatebone repair when applied locally in vivo. However, the systemic administration of growth factors tostimulate generalized bone growth is limited by their equally potent, and less desirable, extra-skeletalactions. This proposal will examine whether IGF-I and PDGF, linked to a bone seeking agent whichtargets them to bone and renders them inactive in the circulation, will prevent bone loss or restore bonemass in estrogen deficient rats. The effects of the growth factors on bone will be followed usingbiochemical markers of bone metabolism, state-of-the-art non-invasive bone densitometry, histomorpho-metry and mechanical strength testing. These studies are designed to lead directly to furtherinvestigations to develop clinically useful therapeutic agents for osteoporosis.",

Fast gating of the ferroelectric cathode has been previously demonstrated on nanosecond time scale with laser pulse gating but such gating is less useful than electronic gating for most applications. The ferroelectric cathode attractive for applications in vacuum electron devices such as microwave tubes and switches because it produces high density, high quality electron beams yet it is inexpensive and operates at room temperature and in poor vacuum. Electron beam emission occurs when an applied gate pulse alters the spontaneous polarization field in the ferroelectric medium. In Phase I, we will design, fabricate and test a ferroelectric cathode capable of operation at a modulation frequency of at least 100 MHz. The electron emission will be tested as a function of gate pulse risetime and anode-cathode gap voltage. An electron gun capable of operation at frequencies in excess of 1 GHz will be designed in Phase I and will be built and tested during the Phase II effort.

People's speech is often spoken in noisy environments which greatly increases the difficulty of hihg-accuracy speech recognition. The research proposed here will result in the identification of technologies for speech recognition in noisy environments, as well as a prototype system designed to automatically segment speech in noisy environments. Phase I has two primary goals: first, to identify which of a number of signal enhancement algorithms and signal processing techniques are best-suited for the task of segmenting noisy speech; and second, to use these technologies in a prototype system which robustly discriminates between speech and non-speech. Artificial Neural Networks will provide the core discrimination engine in the prototype. If successful, the technology proposed here will be used as a pre=processor to a recognition system which recognizes medical phrases and user interface commands. Such a system can be integrated with numerous applications to allow hands-free data entry and command and control in a wide variety of noisy environments. Anticipated Benefits: Spoken language systems will become an integral part of our lies in the near future. Using speech as an interface will allow hands-free control of computer systems.",

        "abstract": "The study of \"deterministically chaotic\" systems is embryonic and its application to real-time simulation and control is just beginning. A process is determininistically chaotic, as opposed to random if its current value depends on its previous values, but its current value is not predictable. System which have significant non-linear aspects exhibit some degree of chaotic behaviour and in large, complex manufacturing systems, the system may be significantly non-linear. Current tools for planning, scheduling, and simulation for large manufaturing systems generally attempt to use linear mathematics to approximate the system under consideration, and as a result are complex, and brittle. At least one reason for this poor performance is that with chaotic systems, attempts to use closed form mathematics to optimize answers may be hopeless. Under the work herein proposed we will develop both the theory and practice of applying autonomous agents to planning, scheduling, and simulation within a complex manufacturing facility. We will demonstrate this system at Watervliet Arsenal, where our prototype system will provide superior results orders of magnitude faster, with less complex software, and with greater flexibility and reliability than commercially available tools. Computer systems based on autonomous agents are inherently parallel and can execute on massively parallel hardware with no specific parallization. Software and hardware based on the paradigm of autonomous agents are also inherently scalable. Anticipated Benefits: Our work provide the foundation for an entirely new class of planning, scheduling, and simulation systems for manufacturing applications. Beyond manufacturing, our approach to planning and scheduling could be applied in mnay other application areas. As an example, we have demonstrated the use of autonomous agents for battle management, and our initial results are very encouraging.",

This technology enables monolithic integration of vertical cavity surface emitting lasers, vertical cavity resonant detectors and high performance n-channel field effect transistors to implement optoelectronic circuits. The capability to integrate all of these devices is unique to the Inversion Channel Technology and can provide cost effective reliable electro-optic interfaces. The temperature insensitivity of the vertical cavity surface emitting lasers has been established in the literature, but within the Inversion Channel Technology this is also coupled with the temperature insensitivity of the electronics due to the large noise margins realized in this technology. The Phase I work will involve the basic design of simple electro-optic interfaces including electrical interfacing with silicon based electronics and fiber links between electro- optic modules. The expected benefits for NASA include high performance, low weight electro-optic interconnects for space based operations over wide temperature ranges.",

A new forward looking sensor is needed to allow higher speeds at lower altitudes, in more adverse weather, while being covert for the TF/TA operating mode. Although this solicitation request CO2 laser radars for this purpose, we believe there is a better, higher performance, lower cost solution. Mission success and safety of the aircraft and pilot during execution of covert missions, depend heavily on very low altitude flight profiles. This requires precision terrain following, terrain avoidance and obstacle avoidance capability in any weather condition, 24-hours a day anywhere in the world. Covertness of the mission is greatly enhanced if there are no radiated emissions or strong contrast signatures from the aircraft avionics.

Survivors of brain injury have serious learning and memorydeficits, as well as problems dealing with stress, modulating emotions, and interacting appropriately withothers. The literature indicates that no ecologically valid training methods exists to deal with theseproblems. Thus, there is a need for effective methods to help retrain brain-injured individuals in socialdiscourse and communication skills; methods which allow these individuals to relearn practical, real lifetransactions at their own pace in a low-risk clinical setting.

The approach is to evaluate and test a PCS system bradboard using broadband CDMA direct-sequence spread spectrum subjected to jamming. Broadband CDMA provides the widest spread bandwidth which maximizes both AJ and LPI metrics. The PCS system will be based on a commercial system currently in development by InterDigital Additional techniques to improve its AJ and LPI performance, such as agile tunable filters, will also be evaluated. These filters will be derived from units developed by InterDigital as part of our B-CDMA Cellular Overlay demonstrator. The ultimate goal is to develop affordable PCS technology that can support sensitive commercial and government users, as well as the general public. Anticipated Benefits: The benefits to the government would be the ultimate availability for its use of affordable PCS wireless telephones that can be used in areas of hostilities and crises, or for highly sensitive operations where jam resistance and covertness are essential.

This requirement for intracellularreplication appears necessary for processing and presentation of relevant parasite antigens by theendogenous antigen processing pathway. Antigens processed through this pathway become associatedwith MHC Class I molecules and thus become appropriate configurations that activate T lymphocytesof the CD8+ T-cell subset. We will evaluate an alternative in the use of viable organisms for deliveryof antigen for vaccination purposes. The investigator will evaluate Lectin-Antigen complexes as anantigen-delivery strategy for placing antigen into the cytoplasmic domain for processing and presentationto T cells. This Phase I feasibility study will use the lectin, ricin B chain, which will act as a deliveryvehicle of a model antigen, listeriolysin O from Listeria monocytogenes. Listeriolysin O (LLO) will becovalently linked to the ricin B chain to form a complex that will bind to membrane-associatedgalactose-containing glycoproteins. Binding of the glycoprotein by the ricin B chain-LLO complex ispredicted to stimulate internalization of the complex and processing of internalized proteins. The studymay determine if LLO is then processed and presented in a form that is recognized by CD8+Listeria-immune lymphocytes. The information derived from the experiments completed during thisPhase I study is the first step in the development of an antigen delivery system for vaccination againstan array of intracellular pathogens. The long term focus of this project will be the development of novelcarrier reagents recombined with purified or genetically engineered protein antigens that have beenproposed as targets of protective cell-mediated immunity.",

Nonetheless, some products are being produced using this technology (e.g., the Tadpole Unix compatible notebook computer). Semiconductor manufacturing techniques will be adapted to a new process for making laminate interconnects, controlled by proprietary in-situ for in-line process control, which will produce large ares fine lines and spaces with semiconductor reliability.

Int its NTCS-A and OSS variants, UB software has been fielded on over 200 US Navy ships, several naval Intelligence Centers, Joint Command Centers, US Coast Guard ships and in Allied facilities. As such, the software presents a rich envrionment for building powerful decision aids to assit tactical commanders. As the developer of the UB, INRI is uniquely qualified to perform ther esearch and development of AI based tactical decision aids. The proposed research effort will investigate the feasibility of embedding Artificaial Intelligence (AI) applications with the UB architecture. Unlike conventional approaches, the research will no propose use of specialized AI machines, but will explore approaches which utilize existing DTC-II and TAC-III platforms, and is portable to future computing platforms. The proposed research will emphasize an approach which truly integrates into the UB architecture, including conformance to Grapical User Interface (GUI) style guides, use of existing UB databases (tracks, comms, etc.) rather than maintaining duplicate copies, and operation in a distributed netowrked envornment. Key architectural issues to address include LAN loading, precictable performance, distributed processing, and integration versus federation.",

The purpose of this proposed effort is to produce the best device design for monitoring vibrations in equipment and to optimize the design for prototype fabrication. The goal is to devleop an integrated micromechanical sensor that can be used to measure the vibrational modes of operating equipment in high \"g\" and other adverse envirioments including Space systems. This device will instantaneously provide frequency selective information about the vibrational modes, eliminating the need for Fourier transforms, in the frequency range from very low to ultrasonic frequencies.

        "abstract": "In order to best take advantage of digital video, one must have the capability to perform real-time digital signal processing on the video bitstream. This includes compression, wihch can greatly reduce the storage media or bandwidth needed to support digital video. A PC-based card design is proposed which will provide the ability to digitize a color video image at a maximum resolution of 1024 x 512 pixels. The digital bitstream will be processed through a digital signal processor (DSP) and a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), each of which is fully programmable. Algorithms to perform the necessary image processing will be selected and software will be written to drive these components. A video compression RISC processor capable of high-resolution (704x480 NTSC) MPEG, JPEG, and P*64 moving image compression will provide bitstream compression with ratios from 65:1 to 2000:1, depending upon the demand for image quality. An EISA bus interface will then allow the image data to be transferred to PC memory or fixed storage media in real time. A prototype will be delivered which demonstrates video digitization and real time compression on a 352x240 NTSC image at 30 frames per second. Anticipated Benefits: The design of a PC-based system which has the ability to deliver real-time image preprocessing as well as compression would be well received by the image processing community. It would eliminate the data bottleneck which now stifles PC-based video. The extension to a Phase II prototype capable of high-resolution (704x480 NTSC) compression and processing would be a commercially viable innovation.",

In the specific application of Navy aircrafts, graphite-epoxy composites are being used primarily due to ther high strength and low weight. Due to the extreme environments that these materials experience, a nondestructive evaluation (NDE) technique is needed in order to evaluate the effects of exposure to high heat on the composite structures. Electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI) offers a NDE method that provides a means of both qualitative and quantitative evaluation of heat damage/degradation of composite structures. This technique will utilize state of the art technology in laser diodes and fiber optics to achieve real time analysis in a compact unit. The use of fiber optics allows access to remote locations. Instantaneous qualitative analysis of the resultant interferograms provides indications of areas with cracks, delaminations and weak spots. Futher quantiataive analysis of the interferograms by the system control computer will provide strain and stress measurements of the areas of concern. This analysis will indicate the degree of thermal dmage experienced by the composite structure. The Phase I effort of this project will demonstrate the capabilties of a fiber optic ESPI system in the evaluation of heat damage.",

Extraction techniques will include liquid/liquid extraction and solid-phase extractiontubes. Chromatographic techniques will be evaluated both for cleanup and analysis.

We shall compare the performance and cost of high- and low-resolution massspectrometry, as well as MS/MS. The method that we plan to refine and validate during Phase II willbe published in a peer-reviewed journal, and we trust that it will become standard in the drug-testingindustry. It is likely that the method will require a greater degree of skill (and, perhaps, moresophisticated equipment) that is currently available in drug-screening laboratories.

On chipcircuitry can accommodate tunable prefiltering to band limit the signal to be digitized. The approachrelies on combining hundreds of channels in single slope ADCs in a single IC. Numerous IC are stackedon a 3-D configuration described in the proposal. The number of ICs per stack is a variable, dependenton the application and conversion bandwidth desired. Simple stacks could contain greater than 1,000ADC channels operation in parallel. Even greater parallelism can be obtained by assembling the stackson a substrate, so that greater than 10,000 single slope ADCs can be made to operate in parallel in apackage approximately 2 cubic inches.

        "abstract": "Irvine Sensors proposes to develop a 3D silicon long-word (32 bit) wide memory component, suitable for direct replacement of existing 2D byte wide memory product. 3D silicon technology has been historically applied towards achieving a one to two generation advancement in memory devices for a very low cost. However, many embedded systems and pocket computers can significantly benefit from a reduction in total parts to reduce their X-Y size and associated substrate costs, and an increase in performance due to reductions in circuit trace length and capacitance. 3D silicon is the enabling technology to provide a long-word (32 bit) memory component to readily achieve these goals. Because of this critical need Irvine Sensors is proposing an SBIT Phase I and Phase II program to develop a long-word (32 bit) wide memory component. Anticipated Benefits: The development of long-word wide (32 bit) memory components will radically shrink the size and therefore cost of existing MCMs. All embedded MCMs that incorporate a microprocessor require memory typically in 32 to 64 bit chunks. However, the semiconductor industry typically supplies memory only as 4 and 8 bit devices. Because of this, the size of MCM is largely dictated by the memory requirements of the system.",

Current estimates indicate that the volume of available literature is doubling every two years. The technology for management and delivery of that information has been undergoing a similar revolution - a revolution fueled by the ability to digitally transport information at very high rates over very long distances at very low cost. This expansion of information and advancement of technology has created a marketplae. A marketplace whose infrastructure is the internet. A marketplace to which information sellers and information consumers are flocking. A marketplace whose elaboration is stifled by the existing commercial structure. Information consumers have come to this marketplace from such diverse market segments as transportation, entertainment, manufacturing, and health care. These consumers are often not well served by the existing commercial strucutre. The program we propose is one which seeks to break the current multi-service system and replace it with one that includes an information integration component. In recent F-22 and ARPI related efforts, ISX and Unisys have formed a successful team. To date our projects have focused on the development and demonstration of KQML as a standardized transport and communication protocol for data from distributed heterogeneous databases. Our previous efforts have included demosntrated feasibility through prototype development. in this program, we will utilize previously demonstrated primitives to construct a realizable produce that will enhance and improve data access to existing databases by the legal and medical community. Anticipated Benefits: Anticipated benefits include the increased effectiveness and productivity of legal and medical professionals, potential decrease in costs for medical and legal services development of a new service industry and associated jobs, and advancement of the state of the art of heterogeneous database systems.",

In this program, we will extend the list of implemented performatives and extend our demonstration of their utility. Further, we will package the implemented performatives as a unit which can be easily extended and applied in the development of application programs. In this effort we will more fully extend the implementations we have previously developed and take advantage of the flexibilty afforded by higher level languages to provide performatives that can be easily tailored to a variety of platforms and application implementation environments. In addition, we will establish long term maintenance and support machinisms for the products of this work. We will also build a business case with which to examine both the utility of our developed product and the long term viability of continued research and development. This business case will be offered at the end of Phase I. Anticipated Benefits: DRPI, PACT and the F-22 IWSDB effort have demonstrated that a significant component of all future decision making by both military and commercial organizations will be assisted through access over a complex network of intelligent co-operating agents.

The computational methods build on work already accompolished by Chaffee and Zare [Ch 1] combining a two-stage filter with a closed form state transition matrix applicable to orbits of any eccentricity. The receiver innovation is based on a revolutionary design made by a subsidiary of Tracor Aerospace that does all the signal processing numerically in the frequency domain, thereby avoiding the limitations imposed by conventional tracking loops on high dynamic signal tracking and high velocity signal acquisition.

        "abstract": "Bonded hollow blade fan are needed for future gas turbine engines. Currently thin ribbed stiffened pre-bond blade halves are made through a process which generates excessive waste of material and requires much machining. This proposal developes the PULLFORM process, a method for forgoing these components to near net shape. PULLFORM localizes high pressure while limiting tool stress. The tooling applies this localized pressure sequentially over the length of the part. The goal if to forge titanium materials above 1300F. In Phase I we made the PULLFORM process for both Aluminum and Titanium blades and forge a minimum of 10 Aluminum subscale parts to verify the modeling. We also collect and analyze data which enables quantifying the anticipated cost and efficiency benefits of the PULLFORM process in comparison to current technology. The results of these two activities enable meeting milestones which lead to determining the process parameter requirements, equipment and estimated costs for a full scale prototype for forging titanium half blades at high temperatures in Phase II. Anticipated Benefits: The development of affordable commercial and advanced military fighter engine hollow fan blades is a current priority for engine manufacturers. The potential of the project is demonstrated by the no cost participation of our probable partner, Pratt & Whitney, in this project.",

Design automation tools currently exist that automatically synthesize application specific processors. A very high speed simulation tool is needed to augment these tools. In Phase I, a study and design effort would be performed to define the approach for applying Programmable Gate Array technology to this problem. It would evaluate technical issues concerning the simulation element-its capacity, costs, platforms, user interface, and interface to existing design automation tools. The effort would include the detailed evaluation of the PGA VME board for this purpose.

        "abstract": "While the rapid institution of supportive physiologic (organ level) therapies has been highly successful in treating the severely injured, significant number of trauma casualties die as the result of the sequelae of shock. Additionally, the high rate of salvage of idnividuals who would otherwise succumb to an initial insult has created a new constellation of medical problems of which few treatements are available, e.g., ARDS, multi-system organ failure. Current therapies for acute shock states are directed at an organ system-based approach, i.e., supportive physiologic care, as a bridge until definitive surgical or mecial care can be provided. However, during these initial (crucial) periods of time within the so-called golden hour, significant cellular injury goes both undetected and untreated, adversely affecting both acute and long term outcome. To address this problem, preliminary studies on cell based approaches to the treatemen tof one cellular etiology of shock, i.e., hypoxia, are described. Strategies that promote energy synthesis in the absence of oxygen were employed successfully to prevent cellular injury in an isolated liver model of schok subjected to 1 hour of normothermic anoxia. Based on these findings, it is suggested that such treatements may be of utility to other organ systems and other causes of shock. The studies detailed herein focus on: 1. elucidating the cytoprotective mechanisms of such compounds and 2. the development of a set of therapeutic agents capable of treating shock states at the cellular level. Preliminary data is included that suggests that the design of agents directed at the cellular energetic axis may allow for a state of cellular hibernation (suspended animation) during injury intervals, the medical effect of which would be to lengthen the golden hour. Anticipated Benefits: 1) the implementation of a cellular based strategy to complement existing physiologic based treatments of traumatic injury resulting in shock; 2) an improvement in the design of medical diagnositc to detect underlying cellular injury during shock states",

BY TESTING IN PHASE I WITH LOWER PRIMARY STOICHIOMETRY AND INCREASED REBURNING RATE, IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE NOX EMISSIONS OF 0.15 LB/MMBTU OR LOWER WITH PROPANE OR NATURAL GAS REBURNING SUPPLY EQUAL TO 35% OF THE TOTAL BTU INPUT.  DURING TESTING OF THIS COMBUSTOR 99.3% CARBON CONVERSION WASH ACHIEVED IN LONG TERM 100% COAL FIRING TESTS.

Our focus is to test the feasibility of using recombinant agrinprotease inhibitor domains as therapeutic agents. Results from our previous work have demonstratedthat agrin is expressed in a wide variety of tissues and has active protease inhibitory activity. Therefore,our first goal (Phase I) will be to fully characterize this activity; this will be accomplished by expressingand purifying agrin protease inhibitor domains and testing them in vitro in biochemical assays. PhaseII will consist of identifying the natural targets for agrin's inhibition and testing the inhibitors in animaldisease models.

Phase I will employ powerful new methods of Cognitive Task Analysis to elicit the factors underlying judgments of plan robustness. The knowledge elicitation will use the powerful set of cognitive probes with domain experts. The results will be represented first using a series of matrices to contrast robustness factors for different domain experts, and then for different scenarios. Then results will be represented using a hierarchical framework to present the relationships between robustness factors, and to reflect the important contextual factors. The entities and relationships will be codified and implemented in the form of a limited prototype which quantifies plan robustness and uses it to generate more robust plans. Phase II will expand the prototype to generate plans under realistic conditions in complicated domains so that the robustness criteria can be incorporated into other AI planning systems.",

        "abstract": "Efficiently managing the history of a time-evolving system is one of the central problems in many database environments, like database systems that incorporate versioning, or object oriented databases that implicitly or explicitly maintain the history of persistent objects. In this proposal, we propose algorithms that recorstruct past states of an evolving system for two general cases, i.e., when the system's state is represented by a set or by a hierarchy (a forest of trees) and a hardware concept use this a'qorithm. Sets are widely used as a canonical form of representing information in databases or program states. For more complex applications, like schema evolution in object-oriented databases, it becomes necessary to manage the history of data structures that have the form of forests or even graphs. The proposed algorithms use minimal space (proportional to the number of changes occurring in the evolution) and have the advantage of on line (in the amortized sense). Any past system state s (t) is reconstructed in time 0(1 s(t)l + loglogT, where I s(t)l is the size of the answer and T is the maximal evolution time. For all practical cases the loglogT factor is a constant, therefore our algorithms provide almost random access to any past system state. The proposed algorithms are optimal among all algorithms that use space linear in the number of changes in the system's evolution. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - -This approach to management of time-evolving databases applicable to many databases, both commercial and military. Weather business, global warming, and missile trajectory histories are examples of such databases.",

The proposed design is an innovative non-imaging optical concentrator that concentrates the input laser beam from 2mm down to 200 um without the limitations of conventional imaging optics. The design of the concentrator will be evaluated through hand calculations and ray tracing. These ray tracings will be implemented using CAD/CAE Software. The feasibility study will include evaluation of the performance characteristics, physical size, cost and production which will lead to the final design choice. The coupler will have significant impact on any industry that transmits high powe density laser beams through optical fiber such as the military for ordnance initiation and medical energy for therapy.",

We will use our commercial Quadro \"PowerWatch\"TM digital instrument system hardware for the proof-of-principle system. The screen will continuously display vehcile speed and engine speed as well as magnetic compass heading information. The system will have the capability to conduct continuous background monitoring of several power plant functions, log out-of-limits conditions, and display them as visual alarms. Embedded software and non-volatile memory will permit downloading of logged exceptions to an offboard computer for troubleshooting and maintenance diagnosis. The proof-of-principle UDD will be used to conduct user and sponsor surveys to aid in the development of a systems specification for a Phase II fully functional digital UDD. The demonstration will prove the feasibility to our design and will afford an oportunity for constructive input from the Marine Corps for further system refinement and enhancements.",

Thus, the tools could enable more responsive management of therapy. This approachwill employ intensity (including multiparameter MRI intensity), texture, connectivity and morphologiccriteria in defining tumor margins.

In operation, these detectors can significantly improve their signal to noise ratio by cooling to reduce thermal background noise. By maintaining a near constant temperature, more information can be obtained from the output of the detector. At present, these detectors operate from room temperature well into the cryogenic temperature range. Advances in cryogenics have increased the number of detector applications seeking to operate in the 9 to 20 K range. Currently, temperature sensors exist as discrete chips that can be mounted close to the detector to monitor temperature, but the 9 K lower temperature limit is beyond the capbility of most temperature sensors. Those sensors which do operate in the range tend to be physically large forcing them to be mounted in a position which may be far away from the detectyor array. Thermal gradients between the temperature sensor and detector array can cause substantial proboems in interpreting the detector output. A research program is proposed to develop a temperature sensor, useful from 9 to 300 K, which can be fabricated into the detector as part of the detector fabrication or fabricated separately and mounted to the detector as a separate device.",

Transition metal oxides can be used to fabricaed erasable optical data storage media with substantial advantages over existing erasable optical memory media. Our product will be much easier to fabricated than currently employed technologies thereby producing susbtantially improved yields in terms of both the percentage of each disk which can be used and in terms of the percentage of total disks fabricated which are essentially totally unusable. In addition, our product will likely have a substantially improved bit error rate over disks currently available. Disks and associated drives can be designed so that they can be fabricated using existing technologies. The laser chemical processes constituting the read, write, and erase functions are such that it is possible to perform some logical operations on large amounts of data simultaneously with storage. The medium is not susceptible to electromagnetic pulse (EMP) damage. We propose to fabricated a variety of prototypes and test their storage density, read/write/erase speeds, bit error rate, mean time to failure for the cycle - erase-read-write-read- and other specifications. We anticipate that in Phase I of this SBIR we will be able to fabricate and test three prototypes. Anticipated Benefits: The present commercial civilian market for erasable technology having the speed and storage density of optical media is obviously enormous.

        "abstract": "Airborne radars are potentially vulnerable to ground bounce jamming, where the jammer illuminates terrain in the radar's search beam. This poses a difficult ECCM problem, since the scattered jamming arrives from a large region with a spread in both delays and Doppler shifts. The radar must suppress both the ground bounce jamming and ground clutter return. The proposed study addresses adaptive signal processing techniques as a solution to this problem in surveillance radars. The proposal contains simulation results showing that multiple auxiliary beams, each containing scattered jamming from a different area on the ground, can be used successfully as auxiliary inputs to a ground bounce jamming canceler. Simulation and flight tests have shown that space-time adaptive processing (STAP) is an effective method of suppressing clutter and detecting moving targets in airborne radars. During the Phase I study, different signal processing architectures for simultaneously rejecting both types of interference, using multiple beams as ground bounce jamming auxiliary inputs and STAP for clutter cancellation, will be simulated and compared in performance and complexity. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - The techniques developed on this program will lead to improved capability for detecting moving targets from airborne radars. The most important current applications are improved ECCM and ability to detect low echo area targets in DoD radars. The interference suppression capability will also be important in future commercial radars and communication systems.",

This approach relies on the facile conversion, in high ceramic yield, of preceramic polymers to both amorphous and crystalline ceramics at temperatures (600-700 degrees celcius) well below those typically required to form/john ceramics using melt processing and/or hot pressing methods. The basic goal will be to identify a set of preceramic polymers that can be used successfully to join a selected set of ceramic materials, e.g. Si(3)N(4).",

The Eyegaze System monitors a person's eye with a video camera and calculates the position of his gazepoint on a computer monitor in real time at a 60 Hz rate. Today's video eyetrackers must generally be used in rooms without daylight or incandescent light. Ambient infrared light from the sun or incandescent bulbs competes with the controlled lighting from the eyetracker and degrades the eyetracker performance. Ambient infrared light is the chief cause for eyetrackers to lose track of the eye. This proposed research is for a critical improvement to eyetracking technology: an increased tolerance to ambient infrared lighting. There are two general approaches to increasing an eyetracker's tolerance to ambient infrared light. The first involves advancing the optical hardware to increase the signal-to-noise ration in the captured image of the eye. The second involves building more sophisticated image processing software to recognize and measure the pupil and corneal reflection in cluttered images. LC Technologies will pursue both avenues during Phase I and II of this project.",

        "abstract": "One of the important and yet frustrating problems in engineering seismology is the determination of the characteristic site response to earthquake ground motions. The state-of-the-practice is to use the results of one dimensional SH-wave propagation in a layered medium to model the site response. Sophisticated numerical tech- ques are available to model the site response of 3-D structures. However, these models require information of subsurface soil material properties that is often difficult to obtain. Further- more, most techniques and models have not yet been rigourously tested against observed data. Methods that use earthquake data for site characterization are attractive since such data include the most realiastic information on the site response to earthquake ground motions. The difficulty, however, is to isolate the site effects from the source and path effects. Recent studies on site response have indicated that spectral ratio of ground motions at soil to adjacent rock sites, the spectral ratios of the horizontal to vertical components at the soil site, and coda waves method could have practical application in site characterization. The horizontal to vertical spectral ratio method has been applied to both microseismic and mecrotremor data with encouraging results. This method is specially attractive, since it requires seismic recording only at the site of interest. The objective of the Phase I study is to evaluate the most promising techniques for site response characterization using strong motion, weak motion, and microtremor data. The advantages and the shortcomings of each technique, for site characterization will be investigated and discussed. Based on such evaluation, the most practical and re- liable method that could have a broad application and commercial value in the practice of engineering seismology will be identified.",

        "abstract": "The primary objective of this effort is to develop tractable techniques to automatically extract terrain and geologic features from interferometric SAR (IFSAR) imagery and Digital Terrain Elevation (DTE) data produced from IFSAR phase data. A secondary objective is to develop performance prediction techniques for the extraction process. Today terrain information extraction from aerial imagery remains mainly a labor intensive, manual practice. Leighly and Associates, Inc., believe the reasons for this lack of progress has been (1) the lack of terrain organization domain knowledge and the use of context in automated image analysis approaches and (2) the lack of data suitable for tractable and robust solutions. This effort addresses both areas of weakness. An approach will be developed which builds on methods for predicting the occurrence of a limited set of geologic landforms in any given physiographic area, and developing strategies which selectively employ terrain partitioning, identification, and attribution algorithms to three-dimensional SAR image data (IFSAR image and associated DTE data). The initial area of interest will concern southwestern U.S. regions where IFSAR data exists. Methods for predicting feature extraction performance for IFSAR data will be developed that are ajso based on the terrain organization approach to automated feature extraction. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - This effort addresses terrain analysis and in turn terrain analysis supports many dual use applications. Examples of military operations supported by terrain analysis include combat operations planning, automated weapons guidance, IFB, simulation terrain data bases, etc. Examples of civilian value include: site evaluation/engineering, remote surveying, geologica.1 surveys, flooding potential/prediction, etc. Methods and techniques developed here may evolve to processing IFSAR satellite data.

        "abstract": "It is difficult to determine the condition of rolling element bearings and gears by monitoring vibration at the exterior of the gearbox case. Vibrations caused by bearing and gear defects are attenuated as they are transmitted to the case, and extraneous vibratins can interfere. Therefore, we propose the use of smart sensors mounted in the gearbox, on the gears of their shafts. Each sensor contains circuitry, a microaccelerometer to measure vibrations from bearing defects, and a strain transducer t monitor the condition of the gears. A temperature transducer is included for temperature compensation. Some computations will be performed on the sensor, and others will be performed in an external interface unit that monitors the sensors in the gearbox, and provides failure alarms and diagnostic information to the operator. The sensors and interface unit constitute the Rotating Internal Machine Monitor (RIMM), which will be conceptually modeled and designed during Phase I. The team we propose has members from within Life Systems, Inc., Michigan State University and GMI Engineering & Management Institute. They were selected because of their expertise in developing and commercializing machine condition monitors, designing smart sensors and fabricating miniature circuitry.",

As new information becomes available, it willbe possible for users to modify model inputs in a straightforward fashion and conduct multiple sensitivityanalyses. The development of an easily accessible forecasting model for home and community-basedservices would represent an important and timely new analytic tool for state policy-makers, in part,because the Clinton health care reform proposal assigns the states greater responsibility for financingand delivering such services. Currently, many states only have available rigid micro-simulation modelswhich are difficult to understand, require major computing capacity, and require a reliance on outsideconsultants for their proper use and interpretation. Moreover, sensitivity analyses are difficult toperform. The proposed model will enable policy-makers to assess the impact of alternative economicand demographic assumptions as well as alternative program configurations on service utilization, costsand payment source.",

LifeQuest Medical has developed an IO auto-injector (the First-Med System) foremergency delivery of diazepam in pediatric seizures and epilepsy. A needle -- drug cartridge -- springassembly generates sufficient force to puncture skin and bone, delivering a drug bolus into the tibialmarrow in less than one second. The device is in testing for submission to the FDA to begin clinicaltrials. Questions to be answered are critical to commercialization of the device and to the understandingof IO drug delivery. The study in chemically induced seizures in young pigs will determine the (1) relativebioavailability and pharmacokinetics of diazepam by IV and IO routes in pediatric pigs in seizures, (2)volume to be injected into the tibia to produce an effect equivalent to an IV dose, and (3) effectivenessof the First-Med System to deliver drugs.

Thisproject will determine the structure of the vitamin D-3 receptor (VDR), both with and without its naturalhormone, 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D-3 (1,25(OH)2D3). To achieve this goal, recombinant VDR will beexpressed and purified by a scheme that will be developed to optimize yield and purity. The expressionsystem of choice is a yeast host with a copper-inducible ubiquitin-VDR vector that has been optimizedto produce 0.3 -- 3.0 percent of total soluble protein as VDR. This system has been shown to yieldintact, nonproteolyzed VDR that retains its native affinity for both 1,25(OH)2D3 and DNA. The plan isto devise a purification scheme utilizing the incorporation of a histidine tag in the VDR to facilitate itspurification and yield. Preliminary experiments show that this his-VDR protein functions identically tonative VDR. Also, the hormone-binding domain of the VDR (VDR-HBD) will be delineated to determinethe lowest molecular weight protein that retains native affinity for the hormone. This molecule also willbe tagged with histidine and produced in the yeast system, its expression levels and function assessed,and then purified to homogeneity in milligram amounts by metal affinity chromatography for both crystalstructure and NMR solution structure determinations. The project also will include a random screen forVDR agonists and/or antagonists, and compounds that are active without displaying hypercalcemicproperties would be candidates for phase II structure determinations with the purified receptors to aidin rational drug design.

Multilayer mirrors will be frabricated for two specific wavelengths - 11.4 nm and 8 nm. Other wavelengths may be investigated if time permits. Beryllium has the lowest absorption (< 4x10(4)/cm) for these two wavelength regimes of any stable metal. To date there is no published data on Be-based multilayer mirrors for near normal incidence. Preliminary first order calculations show a number of metals with high atomic numbers, Mo and Ru, in combination with Be can be used to fabricate multilayer mirrors with high reflectivities: e.g., Mo/Be, 75% at 11.4 nm. The multilayer mirrors will be fabricated using two magnetron sources mounted within a state-of-the-art custom designed coating chamber. Preliminary multilayer mirrors of W/Be show a interlayer roughness of 3-5 A [rms]. Innovative approaches will be taken to reduce layer roughness or interdiffusion to a minimum, inlcuding the use of Ne as a sputter gas. MIrror substrates will be well polished Si wagers (",

Thisprovides a high sensitivity analysis tool for biomedical research and clinical diagnosis. The mostcommonly used laser for these applications is the Ar-ion laser, since it is well matched to the excitationwavelengths of the most widely used dyes. However this laser is less than optimal for theseapplications: it is fairly large and has low efficiency, so it dissipates much excess heat in the instrumentand consumes substantial electrical power. It also has limited lifetime, so regular repair is necessary.This Phase I aims to investigate the feasibility of developing a compact, efficient, robust, long-lifetimelaser source that would be a superior, cost-effective replacement for Ar-ion lasers in biomedicalinstrumentation. It would be based on new InGaAs diode lasers. The near-infrared output of such adiode would he frequency-doubled in a nonlinear crystal to achieve a wavelength of 510 nm, which isoptimal for DNA sequencing.

Proven computer radome programs will be used to develop a 5 percent or greater broadband design for 90 GHz wiht a radome having an L/D ratio between 2.5 and 3.0. Limited testing will be performed on unknown properties of materials or material combinations which are developed during Phase I. Up to three approaches will be selected for further development based on performance,manufacturability and cost.",

        "abstract": "Link Plux Corporation and TRW, Inc. have recently been successful in implementing miniaturized linked compander technology using digital signal processing (DSP). The current product removes noise from voice transmissions across HF SSB radio (documented US Government testing measures 22 dB average improvement in S/N, with 47 dB maximum). Current proven products apply to AM/SSB signals at MF, HF, VHF and UHF. The application of linked companding technology to improve the complex waveform generated by frequency modulation (FM) is new. Analysis and testing indicate a 6 to 9 dB improvement at threshold can be realized. This should translate into greater clarity and range for any FM radio. The commercial point-to-point FM radio market is one of the largest radio markets in the world. In the area of satellite communications, tests at RCA Laboratories have shown that the use of fixed ratio companders can more than double the capacity of an FDM/FM satellite transponder with no loss of quality. The linked companding product would utilize an infinite-ratio compressor and should have an even greater impact in increasing the capacity of FDM/FM satellite communications. Anticipated Benefits: Anticipated applications are for FM landmobile radios, FDM/FM satellite communications, and all other FM point-to-point radios.",

The Phase I effort will identify comprehensive and complete information on corrosion control, an optimal CBT authoring package for the predicted level of technical training, cost effective hardware recommendations for delivery of the CBT courseware, and a course outline that will form a basis for the development and implementation of the entire corrosion control curriculum. The culmination of this phase will be a demonstration lesson displaying the capabilities of the authoring package implemented by the training design and development team.",

Cost is the primary consideration in the commercial market. Therefore, manufacturing processes are needed to produce components from advanced materials that are affordable and competitive on a cost basis with current materials. Lone Peak Engineering (LPE) proposes to combine two DOD developed technologies to manufacture extremely tough advanced ceramic matrix composites at affordable costs. An AFOSR project has developed a new laminar ceramic matrix composite of a ceria-zirconia matrix reinforced with layers of CEO2-ZrO2 ceramics. These layered composites have the potential for fracture toughness as high as some tool steels, up to 40 MPa-m. In a separate ARPA project, LPE is developing a desktop manufacturing system for monolithic ceramics using a laminated object manufacturing (LOM) technique. The LOM technique is uniquely suited to manufacture the layered ceramic composites. The objective of the Phase I project is to demonstrate the feasibility of manufacturing the layered ceramic matrix composites using the LOM technique. The objective of the Phase II project will be to develop the equipment and processes to that layered composites can be manufactured for DOD and commercial applications at reasonable costs. Anticipated Benefits: The combination of the LOM process and layered ceramic composites will provide a cost-effective method to produce reliable ceramic components with high fracture toughness in the shapes required for various applications. The components will find applications in both the DOD and commercial markets.",

        "abstract": "Fouling is a serious problem encountered when membranes are utilized to treat shipboard graywater. Its resolution is particularly critical aboard naval vessels due to space limitations. A hybrid membrane is proposed which is capable of producing an effluent with a biological oxygen demand (BOD) and suspended solids less than 30 ppm with 95% rejection of oils, surfactants, etc. The membrane features a unique, non-absorbing layer fixed upon the surface of the polymeric ultrafiltration membrane substrate. Not only does this layer inhibit fouling but it facilitates cleaning of the membrane surface and is stable to macromolecular spatial rearrangement. Consequently, system longevity is extended. Although this membrane can be used for a variety of applications in which adsorption of feed species and concomitant membrane fouling limit the utility of ultrafiltration membranes, this research will focus upon treating the shipboard graywater. A Phase I research program is needed to characterize membrane configurations and to evaluate operation parameters on graywater treatment. The primary objectives are to prepare membranes with specific performance properties, to verify separation efficiencies, and to demonstrate utility with simulated waste feeds in a bench scale test loop. In Phase II, a prototype scale system will be constructed to demonstrate long term operability.",

        "abstract": "Critical systems need protection from power failure in the field environment. The current generation of uninteruptible power supplies (UPS) is based on storage batteries. This severely limits power density and causes the size of the unit to rise rapidly as the discharge time required increases, since most of the weight and size comes with the batteries. Replacing the storage batteries with a system consisting of a fuel cell, electrolyzer, and gas storage allows a significant increase in the power density and a concomitant decrease in the size of the system. In this system, while power is available, the electrolyzer converts water into hydrogen and oxygen for storage. When the power fails, the fuel cell, which is kept fully charged with gas and waiting at its full open circuit voltage, recombines the hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity. Since only a small portion of the system, the gas storage, is devoted to energy storage the rate of increase in size with increasing discharge time is reduced. Using fuel cells instead of batteries keeps all of the desirable features of batteries (rapid start-up, ambient temperature operation, and electrical recharging) while substantially reducing system size and weight.",

New technology is required to provide for removal of impurities common to spacecraft waste waters. This proposal describes a new membrane separation process based on a unique principle that offers significant advantages over existing water recovery processes. A distinct advantage of the new process is its inherent ability to attain very high water recovery levels (i.e., 99%) from multiple waste water streams (i.e., containing inorganic, organic and biological contaminants) with minimum pretreatment. This is in contrast to existing systems which require several steps and often lead to the accumulation of substantial quantities of brines/reject concentrates that represent a significant water loss from the system. The specific goals of the research are to demonstrate the technical feasibility of the membrane separation process for high levels of water recovery from high load contaminated waste water and to demonstrate that the system is capable of efficiently recovering water from concentrates and brines. The research will involve the use of innovative membrane configurations that will render the process highly energy efficient (energy costs are projected to be 10-15 Whr/lb of water treated).

        "abstract": "Power requirements for manned U.S. spacecraft missions have been provided by fuel cells powered by cryogenic hydrogen and oxygen launched from earth. For long-term missions, propellant weight makes this approach prohibitive. Regenerative H2-O2 fuel cells have been identified as an enabling technology for many long-term space applications and are particularly advantageous where high power, low weight and very long cycle life are important. Since the physical and chemical requirements of the oxygen positive electrodes differ in the charge and discharge modes, the tendency has been to separate the functions of the charge and discharge units. However, a bifunctional regenerative fuel cell is highly desirable because it would considerably lower weight and volume and increase reliability, since no separate valves for gas and water transfer between charge and discharge modes would be required. Thus, the objective of this project is to develop a new generation of bifunctional regenerative fuel cells having ultralight components and a simple means of construction. If successfully developed, it would offer substantial improvements in performance and lower cost over previously developed regenerative fuel cells. The long-term impact of the proposed effort will be broad based, since the innovations can be applied to advance the development of other electrochemical subsystems important to long-term space missions. A dual-use development approach will be followed because the technology has both NASA uses, along with commercial applications.",

However, many wounds (e.g., burns,decubitus ulcers) require assistance to heal. One means of improving this process has beenaugmentation of the wound with a biocompatible, bioconductive transition matrix --most often, collagen-- which provides a protective (barrier) function and also encourages regenerative repair rather thanscarring. Various forms of electrical stimulation (direct or induced field, pulsed or continuous) have alsobeen found to restore healing in tissues where repair is arrested as well as improving the rate andintegrity of repair of injured normal tissues. In addition, electrically stimulated tissues generally exhibitdecreased infection. We will develop a bilaminate electronic wound seal composed of collagen and apiezoelectric polymer (polyvinylidene diflouride) which combines the advantages of a bioconductivematrix with the bioinductive stimulation provided by the electret upon motion-induced mechanicaldeformation. PVDF; thus, it eliminates the need for an external apparatus for electrical stimulation andcan be removed from the bilaminate after a suitable period, leaving the transition matrix behind tocomplete reneneration.

        "abstract": "Multichip modules (MCM) technology is a technology that bridges the widening gap between the increasing complexity and speed of monolithic integrated circuit (IC) devices and the ability to package them in a system environment that preserves the inherent speed and thoughput of the devices. A wide variety of production processes has resulted in a lack of standardization, which complicates the selection of substrates and choice of interconnection and passive elements integration technologies. The insertion of low-profile passive components into MCM is costly, laborious and time consuming. Processes which directly incorporate fabrication of those components into existing MCM technologies are needed. Recently, Lynntech, Inc. has invented and demonstrated the feasibility of a novel photopolymerization process for the preparation of high-quality electronically conducting organic polymer materials. The successful results obtained provide a strong technical base for further development work, including the application of this technology to the manufacture of passive circuit components and their integration into multichip modules. The photopolymerization process of forming conducting polymers can be easily adapted to a variety of existing MCM technologies and possesses a number of advantages compared to conventional thin and/or thick film passive components production. Attractive features of the new process include a reduced number of manufacturing steps, shorter process times and a high degree of control of passive circuit image transfer. Passive components, such as resistors, capacitors and inductors, based on conducting polymers can be prepared by this novel process with high circuit pattern resolution. Alteration of electrical characteristics and the ability to reproducibly form these components will be investigated in the Phase I research by modifying additives and their concentrations in the starting photopolymerization formulations.",

Of these, the PEM system is the leading candidate fuel cell power source for many military and commercial applications. In order to make PEM fuel cell power sources cost-competitive with competing technologies and more effective in meeting various mission requirements, the chemical composition, structure and configuration of fuel cell components need to be optimized with regard to weight, performance, cost and the ability to be mass produced. Up to the present time, PEM systems have largely been optimized around the combination of electrodes applied to the proton- conducting polymer electrolyte membrane. The objective of this project is to develop a new generation pf PEM fuel cells having ultralightweight components and a simple means of construction as well as a novel means of internal hydrogen gas humidification. New and novel concepts for catalytic electrodes, internal humidification of the PEM electrolyte, current collectors/reactant flow fields and bipolar plates have been incorporated into the design of the proposed PEM fuel cell. A performance of 0.8 V and 1.0 A cm-2 at 95oC using pure H2 and 02 at 10 atm is the Phase I goal. Because of the attainment of high power density and high energy conversion efficiency, together with the C02-rejecting nature of the strongly acidic PEM electrolyte layer, this fuel cell system readily satisfies the requirement of a dual-use fuel cell technology, (e.g., as the power source for electric vehicles where air, rather than oxygen, is used as the oxidant feed gas). Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - Spin-off technology associated with lightweight, efficient PEM electrochemical systems will have many commercial applications. Lightweight, high power density fuel cells will be used as power sources for electric vehicles, portable power sources for communications/news teams and portable medical instrumentation.",

        "abstract": "At present, four classes of structural adhesives (epoxy resins, phenolic resins, acrylic adhesives and urethanes) are commonly employed in applications where the adhesive joint is either totally immersed in salt or fresh water or subject to high levels of moisture while simultaneously experiencing large shear loads. Each of these synthetic polymer formulations suffers from individual disadvantages such as toxicity, the requirement for extreme conditions of heat and/or pressure to effect a reliable cure, or the necessity of meticulous preparation of the adherend surfaces before reliable bonding can occur. The greatest drawback of these materials as a group, however, resides in the inherent conflict between these synthetic adhesives with their common mode of adhesion and water itself. With this conflict in mind, it is the object of this research to utilize the natural marine adhesives produced by mussels and barnacles, covalently crosslinked by a proprietary catalyzed chemical reaction to produce an alternative structural adhesive naturally designed for use in high moisture environments. The resulting adhesive will have high shear strength, cure at ambient temperatures and pressures, be environmentally safe and require minimal pretreatment of the adherend surfaces prior to bonding. Multiple dual use opportunities exist for a water resistant adhesive in a multi-billion dollar marketplace. Anticipated Benefits: An adhesive that binds readily to wet and/or minimally prepared surfaces, which can bond a wide range of dissimilar materials, and which retains its binding capacity and strength for long periods in high moisture environments would be a distinct improvement over existing adhesives. Such an environmentlaly safe adhesive would have numerous dual use applications in marine and high humidity environments, e.g., military ships, pleasure craft, ATV's, automotive, oil pipelines and drilling platforms, etc.",

THE EMPLOYMENT OF THESE ABUNDANT FUEL RESOURCES IS STILL FRAUGHT WITH THE UNACCEPTABLY COPIOUS EMISSION OF HAZARDOUS POLLUTANTS.  IN ORDER TO ENFORCE COMPLIANCE WITH EMISSION CONTROL STANDARDS AND TO MONITOR THE NECESSARY CLEAN UP OF HOT AND FLUE GAS STREAMS, A REAL-TIME, EFFICIENT, AND RELIABLE DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM IS NEEDED.  CURRENT SYSTEMS ARE EXPENSIVE, DELICATE, AND CUMBERSOME.  THIS PROJECT OFFERS A NOVEL OPTICAL DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM CAPABLE OF IN-SITU, REAL-TIME, AND ACCURATE MONITORING OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANTS.  THE MAIN OBJECTIVE IS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF THE PLANNED SYSTEM TO ACCURATELY AND IN REAL TIME DETERMINE CONCENTRATIONS OF POLLUTING SPECIES GENERATED BY VARIOUS COMBUSTION AND CHEMICAL PROCESSES.  THIS FEASIBILITY STUDY ENCOMPASSES THE INCORPORATION OF READILY AVAILABLE ELECTRO-OPTIC COMPONENTS SUCH AS LIGHT SOURCE, FIBER OPTICS SENSOR, CIRCULAR VARIABLE FILTER, FABRY-PEROT INTERFEROMETE, AND INFRARED DETECTOR INTO AN ADVANCED NOVEL INSTRUMENT.  THE PHASE I EFFORT IS DIRECTED INTO THREE MAIN TASKS: (1) EVALUATION OF THE TRADE-OFF BETWEEN THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS TO YIELD BEST OVERALL PERFORMANCE, (2) DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A BREADBOARD PROTOTYPE FOR A SINGLE REPRESENTATIVE SPECIES (E.G., A SELECTED OPTICAL WAVELENGTH), AND (3) OVERALL INTEGRATION AND TESTING.  PHASE I WILL PROVIDE THE TECHNICAL BASIS FOR EXTENDING THE DIAGNOSTICS TO OTHER SPECIES DURING PHASE II.  ONCE FEASIBILITY IS PROVEN, A PROTOTYPE WILL BE DESIGNED, CONSTRUCTED, AND FULLY TESTED.",

The gyro design is modified to accommodate such planar processes. The advantages of modularity, high precison, batch processing and automated assembly are expected to yield low-cost, small size, low power instruments with high reliability. In addition, the emergence of millimachining to fabricate structures several orders of magnitude larger than microstructures, yet with the same feature resolution, expands the scope of planar technologies from micrometer to centimeter sized devices bridging the fabrication gap between the micromechanical and macromechanical (conventional) instruments. Gyros as well as accelerometers fabricated by this approach should rival the performance of conventional, inertial-grade instruments on the higher dimensional end of the spectrum. The development approach is to begin with the manageable large size, develop the models and design and proceed with size reduction.",

Off-The-Shelf wide-band receivers are not suitable for wide-band verification instrumentation applications because they do not meet the detection time requirements necessary across the .5 - 18 GHz frequency band. This program will develop the requirements specification for the wide-band receiver, multiple receiver design approaches responding to the requirments specification and a trade-off study analyzing each design.

        "abstract": "A fast and precise measurement system is needed for production line testing of bobbin baselayers and wound bobbins. This system should also support investigations to establish the acceptance criteria. The video metrology machine proposed for Phase II will achieve rapid image acquisition by taking a sequence of video frames as the bobbin is rotated and translated through the field of view. The laser light source will pulsed in synchronism with the bobbin rotation to capture images at selected angular positions about the bobbin. Post processing of the data will re-sequence the frames into end-to-end axial profiles. The Phase I program will compare two image acquisition concepts: A collimated laser beam is interrupted by the bobbin profile producing a silhouette on the detector array of a video camera. A sheet of laser light produces an illuminated line on the bobbin surface. The video camera captures the surface shape at this slice by viewing at an angle between the surface and the light sheet. Images of actual bobbin baselayers and windings will be acquired with the two configurations and evaluated as a basis for design of a Phase II high-speed precision inspection system. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - Recording the surface configuration of bobbin baselayers and windings can create a valuable data base for winding studies, statistical process control and failure analysis. On-the-fly image acquisition and off-line processing of mosaic profiles will have applicability in other production and research programs.",

These include the archetypal alpha and beta subfamily membersinterleukin-8, a neutrophil selective chemoattractant and the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1(MCP-1). Chemotactic movement and activation of monocytes, a requisite early process in host defense,is likely regulated predominantly through ligand occupancy of MCP-1 chemokine receptors. Our longterm goal is to develop pharmacotherapeutics which intervene in the interaction of MCP1 with itsreceptor with 2 basic objectives: 1) Immunosuppressive/anti-inflammatory modulation of mono-cyte/macrophage function by blocking chemotactic responses through antagonism of the MCP-1receptor. Glomerular nephritis, rheumatoid arthritis, pulmonary diseases and atherosclerosis are primarydisease targets, and 2) Pro-inflammatory modulation of monocyte/macrophage function throughdevelopment of peptide-based MCP-1 receptor agonists with cancer as a disease target. The specificaims of this proposal are to 1) molecularly clone the cDNA encoding the MCP-1 receptor and 2) createcell lines which stably and functionally express high levels of MCP-1 receptors. These cell lines will beused to develop an MCP-1 receptor antagonist/agonist screening system to identify candidatepharmacotherapeutic molecules from natural and synthetic compound libraries.",

We propose to build and test two LHN alternatives -- multiple voice-grade dialup lines, and ISDN. We propose to produce a Final Report containing test results, conclusions, and recommendations for further work. The requirements-gathering step assures that the customer's requirements will be met. MaK's proximity to the DSI hub and MaK's extensive DIS resources and experience assure that program cost and program risk will be low during the build-and-test step. Anticipated Benefits: The proposed project will increase the readiness of both National Guard units. It can increase the readiness of deployed tropps by enabling forward-deployable simulators. It will increase DSI participation by lowering the cost-barrier to entry. It will enable extremely low-cost DIS LHN operations independently of the DSI.",

        "abstract": "The FLAPS antenna is a printed circuit array of varying length dipoles which forms a phased-array surface with the ability to scatter incident RF in any desired steering direction and shaping. To date Malibu Research has used this technique in a variety of fixed-beam antenna applications (Examples are shown herein). It is particularly effective at 35 GHz and 94 GHz. We have shown analytically that small modulations in the thickness of the printed circuit substrate results in a compolete 360o variation in the local RF or ordinary ceramic piezo-electric materials such as PZT. The a FLAPS dipole (array of dipoles) printed on a slab of piezo-electric material, locally excited by a simple voltage, forms the basis of a very low-cost, low-loss millimeter wave electronically steered phased array. Furthermore ceramic piezoelectrics are very inexpensive to manufacture, especially in slab form. Our proposal addresses both a piezoelectric reflective MMW phase shifter as well as a conformal, lenses phase shifter configuration with application to a 5\" guided projectile. Under the proposed Phase I SBIR effort such a piezoelectric phase-shifter mini-array will be analyzed, built, and tested. If successful the resulting phase-shifter array costs would (finally) make electronic scan antennas affordable for commercial markets.",

This review will be used to identify the central characteristics of the mental models leaders use in operatinal problem solving, planning, and visioning and identify the kind of differential and situational variables that influence the development and application of these models. Subsequently, compuer-based measures for assessing leaders' operational problem solving, planning, and visioning models will be constructed and validated. These measures will then be applied in a series of experimental studies intended to identify the kinds of training interventions likely to contribute to the development and effective application of these models.

To improve the current CRRC(S), designs must be sought that will improve seakeeping capabilities and speed as well as embody low detectability. The transom material should be non-reflective yet retain a dimension compatible with egress from the Forward Escape Trunk (FET) of a 688 class submarine. MARAVIA is the premier builder of inflatable crafts, has technical knowledge of the many problems associated with these platforms and has studied ways and means to improve the performance of CRRC(S). Our plan utilizes a rigid inflatable material called \"INFAB\" that can be shaped into hull forms of superior seakeeping characte- ristics with the potential to reduce the spectral signature of the craft at all speed and load conditions. The reduction of spray and wake of the new craft will be crucial to any proposed design.

The massively parallel processing capability of the neural filter makes it ideally suitable for real-time in-flight application. In the proposed work, such a neural filter will be developed for a commonly used spacecraft attitude measuring unit, which is composed of 3 single-axis gyros and 2 fixed head star trackers. The developed neural filter will be able to perform attitude estimation and sensor calibration and alignment in the presence of the gyro misalignments and drifts and the star tracker misalignments and observational errors. The performance of the neural filter will be compared with that of the extended Kalman filter in a Monte Carlo study.

The novelty of the proposed system lies in its neural filter, which is used in lieu of the commonly used linear adaptive transversal and recursive filters. The neural filter has a more genral structure and has been proven to approximate any nonlinear dynamic system to any desired degree of accuracy, provided that the neural filter has enough hidden neurons. This property is expected to generate a very good antinoise for a noise process that can not be closely approximated by a linear autoregressive moving average process in a short sliding window of time. The neural filter can be implemented on commercially available neural network chips (e.g. Intel's 8OI7ONX ETANN), which are small and energy frugal. The extremely fast processing speed of these chips will allow cancellation of high frequency components of the diesel engine noise, eliminating the need for passive noise suppression measures. The neural filter can be trained to ignore strong acoustic interferences picked up by the residual error microphone(s) . This robustness is very important for an application on an UAV, because the loud propeller noise can upset and confuse such conventional algorithms as filtered-X LMS and filtered-U RLMS.",

        "abstract": "In the past microwave/millimeter wave (MMW) ferrite filters have been fabricated utilizing insulating ferrite materials. We propose for the first time a degisn in which metallic magnetic films are used. Whereas conventional filter designs which include insulating ferrite materials utilize the phenomenon of ferromagnetic resonance (FMR), we propose the use of magnetic metal films in filter designs and utilize the phenomenon of ferromagnetic anti-resonance (FMAR). Preliminary studies indicate that in comparing the characteristics of the two thypes of filters the filter utilizing magnetic metal films are superior in terms of insertion loss and integrability with other planer MMW devices. Our design includes a thin magnetic metal film in the substrate layer of a microstrip line parallel to the ground plane. The characteristic impedance of the microstrip line in the absence of the metal film is 50 ohm. A dc magnetic field is applied normal to the film plane. When the magnetic film is biased away from FMAR the magnetic metal film interferes strongly with wave propagation. The characteristic impedance of the line is much smaller than 50 ohm. When the magnetic metal film is biased at FMAR the skin depth within the magnetic metal film becomes substantially greater than the film thickness. At FMAR the impedance of the line changes back to 50 ohm which matches the input signal feeder line. Therefore, design of band-pass filter can be realized in which the transmission frequency occurs at FMAR frequency with a frequency bandwidth equal to the FMAR linewidth.",

Early screening andtreatment can prevent or slow the loss of vision but is hampered by inadequate and expensivetechniques to measure intra-ocular pressure (IOP). Currently, the \"Gold\" standard for measuring the IOPis the Goldmann contact applanation tonometer, which requires the use of a topical anesthetic andappropriate clinical training, or the air-puff tonometer, which is inaccurate and uncomfortable for thepatient. We have developed technology for non-contact tonometry with potential for high accuracy,non-discomforting to the patient, and easy and quick to use. Our basic technology for the device hasbeen developed and demonstrated on rabbit cadaver eyes. In Phase I, we would complete theinstrument and perform basic tests on human subjects. In Phase II, additional modifications to theinstrument to improve accuracy would be implemented, more extensive clinical trials would beconducted, tests on subjects with scarred or swollen corneas would be conducted, and the potential ofthis technology for take-home use would be evaluated.",

A novel fabrication technique is proposed that has very los associated costs and has the potential to produce fully dense B4C. In addition, the process allows for net shape forming so that complex shapes can easily be produced. The method has been termed CVR for chemical vapor reaction with B-containing gaseous species. This process has already been successfully utilized to convert graphite fibers to B4C, so that the probability of successfull converting bulk graphite pieces is high. The proposed approach involves first optimizing CVR parameters to produce high density, high purity B4C monoliths. Optimized materials will be completely characterized, including measurements of mechanical properties, elastic modulus, and hardness. Tiles will be produced for evaluation by the Army. The project will culminate with an economic analysis that will project the cost of producing B4C tiles by the CVR process. This will determine the feasibility of the technique to produce los cost, high density B4C materials.",

This closed cage molecular structure bestows fullerene based solids with two important characteristics: first, an unprecedented lattice structure; and second, a molecular environment around fullerenes that is highly electronegative. The lattice structure of fullerene based solids consists of large octahedral sites, large enough to store any bi-molecular gas molecule. The highly electronegative molecular environment around fullerenes energetically favors physical adsorption of gas species - thereby providing the necessary thermodynamic incentive for gas storage. These unique combination of characteristics makes fullerene based solids ideally suited for storage, generation and delivery. This proposal will establish, as part of Phase I work, the proof-of-concept that fullerene based solids can store and delivery oxygen. The effort envisioned is to prepare fullerene based oxygen storage and generation units in many different forms. The Phase I effort will directly lead a scaled up design for the Phase II work.

        "abstract": "The primary structural requirement of V-22 fuselage panels is to retain integrity in a post-buckled state under panel compression and shear loads. However, during certain flight conditions, these panels are subjected to impact by high velocity ice shards (300 to 500 knots) shed from the rotor blades. The current panel design of E-glass fabric laminates has shown severe loss in integrity after ice-impact. This proposed program will use sound analytical methods to evaluate alternate material and structural concepts. These methods will reduce the cost of extensive experimentation with different concepts. Impact induced delaminations are critical for composite panels. To enhance the interlaminar fracture toughness and reduce the delamination damage, approaches using toughened matrix materials, adhesive layers, and metal/composite hybrids, will be evaluated. A family of 3-D woven composites recently developed at MSC, which may provide significant improvement in delamination resistance, will also be evaluated. In addition, hybrid composites including a surface layer such as tough films or fabrics to provide extra energy absorption and surface protection, will also be considered. These material concepts will be evaluated by using analytical models for impact damage assessment and panel performance. Promising panel concepts will be fabricated for impact and residual compression strength testing.",

The computer code will combine a fracture mechanics treatment of the stable growth of partially-bridged surface and internal (penny-shaped) cracks with a compliance analysis to predict progressive damage (decreasing elastic modulus) with increasing monotonic or cyclic loads. The input to the code will include constituent material properties (elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio and fracture toughness), interface properties (friction stress), bulk properties (fiber volume fraction, laminate geometry, residual stresses), an initial distribution of microcracks governed by the microstructure (fiber distribution) or contact-induced damage, and nature of loading. The code output may take the form of a simulated stress-strain curve for monotonically increasing loading, or progressive change in compliance under static or cyclic loading. The Phase I effort will be restricted to unidirectional composites and modeling of the inert (rate independent) behavior of ceramic composites. Extension of the code to multi-ply laminates to predict progressive damage under sustained time-dependent crack growth and/or cycle-dependent crack growth (fatigue) will be deferred to Phase II.",

These may include hollow cathodes, various electrode surfaces, and extraction grids, to name only a few. Although several methods exist for the deposition of diamond coatings, many of these processes are limited in their ability to produce doped diamond films with reproducible quality. In this Phase I effort, we will demonstrate the feasibility of producing diamond that is doped using two different deposition techniques. We will first use a modified hot filament CVD method to deposit doped diamond films from acetone/methanol mixtures containing the p-type dopant as a boron-containing compound, and measure their electrical resistivities. Since large area deposition at high rates will be desired, we will also attempt to use a DC-arcjet to deposit boron-doped diamond films using boron containing precursors. Analytical instrumentation such as scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy will be used to characterize the films. Preliminary electrical resistivity measurements will be performed on films produced using a four-point probe. We expect to scale up the technique in Phase II to deposit doped diamond coatings over prototype electrode and insulator components for extensive evaluation so that the technique can be adapted for production during Phase III.",

C-C composites are excellent candidates for a wide variety of components such as automotive clutches, brakes, and liners, due to its friction and heat transfer characteristics. Recently, within the past five (5) years, new C-C processing procedures have significantly reduced the cost of fabrication thus creating expanded opportunities for development of new friction components particularly for applicatoins in the automotive industry. In this proposed Phase I effort, Materials Modifications, Inc., has teamed with the world's leading C-C aircraft brake manufacturer, to develop the sequences required for commercial production of C-C Pistons. Successful design and production of C-C pistons in the Phase I, will permit extensive engine bed testing during Phase II. MMI has initiated early colaboration with major automotive manufacturers for participation in this development and testing effort upon successful development of a cost effective processing procedure. Anticipated Benefits: Cost effective fabrication of C-C pistons will significantly improve performance through increased strength, reduced weight, and reduced friction. Successful testing will lead to other C-C components in the automotive industry such as clutches, sleeves, liners and in the electronics industries in packaging.",

At present, applications for these innovative transducer materials are limited by the lack of a cost-effective manufacturing technology for composite assembly. To realize more widespread application, these materials must become available in both manufacturing and prototyping quantities at acceptable cost. Under separate Navy funding, MSI has developed a low cost injection molding process for large scale piezocomposite manufacturing. The availability of a shape-versatile, low cost tooling technology to complement this process would make new designs possible, and allow the performance of these materials to be optimized through rapid composite design verification. In addition, the low cost tooling would facilitate short-run manufacturing of these materials for specialty applications in both the defense and commercial sectors. In Phase I, MSI will design and demonstrate a new tooling concept aimed at facilitating the synthesis and application of composite transducer materials. This tooling technology will allow injection molding tools to be produced for approximately one-tenth of the cost of conventional tooling. The approach will utilize the existing MSI injection molding process for forming the PZT element array prior to composite assembly. At the end of Phase 1, the basic tooling approach will have been verified through fabrication of an advanced 1-3 piezocomposite, enabling the technology to be refined and applied in Phase 2 for fabrication of testable devices and utlimately in manufacturing quantities.",

        "abstract": "Maxdem has developed a novel family of exceptionally high modulus, high strength, thermoplastic resins, designated Poly-X(th), based on processable rifid-rod polymer technology. Poly-X(tm) derivatives possess a unique array of properties among organic polymes and, yet, are projected to be competitively priced at commercial production levels. Surprisingly for rigid-rod polymers which tend to be totally immiscible with flexible polymers, Poly-X(tm) has been found to extremely compatible with polycarbonate over the entire composition range. Blends or laminates combining the desirable properties of rigid-rod SRP's and polycarbonate are expected to make excellent ballistic-protective materials. During the proposed Phase I work, test samples of two Poly-X(tm) derivatives and several modifications thereof will be prepared for intial ballistic polycarbonate and incorporation of glass-fiber mats and short-glass fiber reinforcements. A successful effort will demonstrate novel Poly-x(tm) product forms with promising ballistic properties. Phase II efforts will build on this work and include more detailed testing of larger structural sections and optimization of the composition and construction of a practical ballistic protective material for military uses. Anticipated Benefits/Potential - A novel class of strong, impact-resistant thermoplastics which will serve as low-cost, ultralightweight armor materials. Applications include armor for highly maneuverable military vehicles and aircraft for opaque materials and protective windows, covers, helmets, goggles, etc. for transparent materials.",

The principal Phase I objectives are to demonstrate this indicial-function procedure with a finite-element Euler code and to document the reduced overall effort required for simulation studies in comparison with direct coupling of the Euler code with the solution of the vehicle motion equations.",

        "abstract": "We will establish the feasibility for applying a new and noninvasive method to the developmentof a practical instrument for sensitive and quantitative detection of microembolic involvement in humanlungs. Because present methods for detection of pulmonary emboli utilize imaging techniques, the sizeof emboli detectable by these methods are limited by the inherent spacial resolution of x-ray and gammacameras. Microemboli (obstruction of the microcirculation) are therefore too small to be detected bystandard methods. Since microemboli are not detectable, there is no direct evidence that microembolicinvolvement is of clinical significance. However, microembolic involvement has been shown to be acause in Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a disease having a high mortality (over 50%) inhumans. Microembolic involvement in other trauma associated conditions, including surgery, is alsospeculative. Phase I would address validation of the principle of the new method in experimentalanimals. The economic goal of Phase II would be to test the likelihood of microembolic detectionbecoming standard medical practice. Accomplishment of this goal involves a combination of technicaldevelopment and scientific studies. Given a successful Phase I, Phase II would 1) develop a practicalinstrument for human studies, and 2) perform clinical research studies designed to verify thespeculations of microembolic involvement in ARDS and other trauma associated conditions.",

MEMBRANE PROCESSESS COULD MAKE THIS GAS AVAILABLE IF MEMBRANES WITH A METHANE/NITROGEN SELECTIVITY OF 6 OR MORE WERE AVAILABLE; A NUMBER OF MATERIALS THAT ARE WITHIN THE RANGE OF THIS SELECTIVITY HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED.  ONE POLYMER HAS A SELECTIVITY OF 5.5, THE HIGHEST POLYMER MEMBRANE METHANE/NITROGEN SELECTIVITY KNOWN.  THESE METHANE-PERMEABLE MEMBRANES WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO AN INNOVATIVE PROCESS THAT SEPARATES THE RAW GAS INTO THREE STREAMS: A PRODUCT GAS STREAM CONTAINING LESS THAN 4% NITROGEN AT PIPELINE PRESSURE: A CONDENSED, HIGHER HYDROCARBON (GREATER THAN 3 CARBONS) STREAM, WHICH HAS MORE VALUE AS A LIQUID CHEMICAL FEEDSTOCK THAN AS A GASEOUS FUEL; AND A WASTE, NITROGEN-RICH GAS STREAM, WHICH IS USED TO POWER THE PROCESS AND FOR OTHER ON-SITE FUEL USE.  THE COST OF PRODUCING PIPELINE GAS BY THE PROCESS IS ESTIMATED TO BE $(.55/THOUSAND STANDARD CUBIC FEET FOR A 1 MILLION CUBIC FEET PER DAY PLANT, WHICH IS VERY COMPETITIVE WITH ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGIES.  IN THE PHASE I PROGRAM, THE NEW MEMBRANE MATERIALS WILL BE EVALUATED, AND THE OPTIMUM MATERIAL WILL BE SELECTED FOR SCALE-UP IN PHASE II.  THE TESTS WILL PROVIDE DATA ON THE EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON THE METHANE FLUXES AND METHANE/NITROGEN SELECTIVITIES.  THESE DATA WILL THEN BE USED TO PERFORM A TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS OF A PROCESS THAT INCORPORATES THE MEMBRANES INTO AN ENERGY-EFFICIENT SEPARATION SCHEME THAT ALSO RECOVERS NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS.

They have latent potential in the commercial sector for infrastructure rehabilitation, both nationally and internationally. The processing parameters for phthalonitrile polymer resins will be evaluated to achieve optimization of conditions for prepregging, sizing and fabrication. Mechanical, thermal, and solvent testing will be performed to support the optimization test plan. The Phase I results will transition into Phase II, during which part selection and design will be performed to evaluate thermomechanical performance of the carbon-fiber-reinforced phthalonitrile polymer resin. Tooling fabrication will also be performed. Phase II culminates in the fabrication of prototype parts.

Current MRI agents are small molecular weightgadolinium(III) chelates which have limited water proton relaxation ability (relativity) and thus, in certaincircumstances, limited MRI enhancement capability. Multiple doses are often used, at high cost (app.$250), to insure detection of small lesions. Metasyn is planning to compete with these products withan agent with much higher relativity and the same cost as a single dose of the conventional agents (app.$85). In addition, it is anticipated that a high-efficiency agent would lead to a longer window ofenhancement which is in demand for use in lengthy MRI exams. The overall goal is to test the feasibilityof certain gadolinium(III) chelates which bind reversibly to human serum albumin (HSA) in blood andtissues. The increase in the rotational tumbling time of the chelate leads to increased relativity. A seriesof chelates will be synthesized and tested for relativity, HSA binding ability, and biodistribution in rats(including blood clearance rates). Structure-activity relationships will be determined as a function of thelipophilicity of the chelates. The tumor MRI enhancement capability for the agents with the highestrelativity and blood concentration will be evaluated in a rat tumor model (mammary adenocarcinomaR3230AC) and compared to conventional agents.

These include high sensitivity state-of-the-art coherent radar systems, Ultra-Wideband radar systems, advanced SAR processing, including auto-focusing algorithms, and Pulsed- delta K waveforms and processing. A selection process will be undertaken to determine which technologies have the best possible potential for success. Experimental data will be collected on those applications with the highest potential payoff. The data will then be off-line processed in various ways for comparison. The results will be compiled and documented in the final report which will also recommend the radar system definition for a wide area search system.

        "abstract": "This proposal details the necessary steps to adapt the newly developed technique of Resonant -- Holographic Interferometric Spectroscopy (RHIS), a powerful spectroscopic technique, to measure NOx in real time at facilities such as the combustion test rigs at NASA Lewis. RHIS combines the three-dimensional capabilities of holography, the phase sensitivity of interferometry, and the species selectivity of spectroscopy. State-of-the-art RHIS instrumentation under development at MetroLaser is based on probing with UV and visible lasers. The innovations in this proposal are to extend the wavelength range of RHIS into the near IR, to provide real-time data and to adapt the technique to measure NOx; an important by-product of combustion linked to ozone depletion. Extension of RHIS into the IR greatly increases its versatility because the use of laser diodes dramatically reduces its complexity, size, and expense. The main challenge for RHIS in the IR is the lack of suitable holographic material. To meet this challenge, significant effort will be devoted during Phase I to examine nascent photorefractive materials for IR sensitive RHIS.

        "abstract": "Laser photography has been used successfully to record dynamic, explosive events by exploiting the narrow tunable bandwidth and short pulse time of the laser. The events are viewed through narrow bandwidth filters and fast shutters that render the ambient light and the light generated by the explosion itself negligible compared to the laser energy. Laser photography techniques have been applied primarily in laboratory environments and must undergo considerable refinement to become applicable in harsh, full scale, outdoor environments. The detailed examination of many explosive events are still obstructed by unuseful light and by out-of-focus debris. The proposal describes a path for technology transfer and also incorporates a unique method for exploiting laser coherence properties to enhance the filtration and viewing of explosive events. This combination with refined methods for filtering and shuttering will lead to a design of a versatile optical recording system for the study of explosive events.",

This composite warfare environment is intensely information driven, and the ultimate effectiveness of battle force and joint operations depends heavily on the exploitation of the aggregate of both on-board and off-board systems including tactical exploitation of national capabilities and intelligence sources. The current trend toward multi-mission system design also amplifies the Navy's need for a more comprehensive means of analytical assessment of architectural options and employment doctrine. This implies that the required SEW synthetic environment must be compatible with and connectable to a larger aggregate synthetic environment composed of multiple individual synthetic environments as required to represent the overall warfighting operational system of the future. The purpose of the proposed Phase I effort is: (1) to establish the feasibility of developing and demonstrating this SEW synthetic environment; (2) to determine critical technologies and the extent to which these required technologies limit near-term synthetic environment capabilities; and (3) to develop a specific Phase II implementation and demonstration plan.",

Like the classic interference filter, this device operates through the selective constructive and destructive interference of the optical waves. However, the use of dispersive media in the filter allows enhanced narrowing of the transmission bandwidth and switching possibilities. In addition, we expect the filter to have high throughout and high out-of-band/in-band rejection. Because the filter is constructed using thin films, it will also be compact and durable. We will construct a prototype three-layer version of this filter using dielectric media and demonstrate its effectiveness through measurements of its transmission coefficient.",

Two pressure fiber optic microphones (FOM), a lens FOM and a shutter FOM, will have their acoustic cavities designed so that they are noise cancelling. The difference in phase and arrival time between sounds generated close to the microphone and those generated farther away will be exploited to achieve the noise cancelling performance. Both microphones are extrinsic, intensity modulated fiber optic pressure microphones using multimode fibers. By designing the acoustic cavity of the transducer so that the deflection of the diaphragm is dominated by sounds produced near the front of the microphone the microphone becomes noise cancelling.",

Thus, the quest for amodality which could transport, store, and release oxygen to the tissues when required. The transportform must also lack immunogenic properties. Early data on the use of free hemoglobin have beendiscussed and the relative lack of success with free hemoglobin solutions and hemoglobin in phospholipidliposomes has been emphasized. Dr. Wallach has preliminary data which demonstrate that non-phospho-lipid liposomes consisting of biodegradable high capacity amphiphiles would be suitable as an erythrocytesubstitute. The dioxyethylenecetylether/cholesterol will be studied with regard to surface charge,proportion of cholesterol upon encapsulation of alpha-alpha cross-linked human hemoglobin, and stateof oxidation of the hemoglobinas well as the stability of the NPL which is carrying hemoglobin. Also, tobe tested are the effects of chain length and hydrophilic head group on the ability of the NPL to carryoxygen. When the physical properties of the NPL are established, they will be administered to rats forexamination of effects on blood pressure, heart rate, and other important parameters. Dr. Wallach wasactually the first investigator to create a liposome when he injected organic solutions of purifiedphosphatidylethanolamine into aqueous media. These liposome vesicles could shorten the coagulationtime of platelet-poor plasma. This was a landmark paper in blood coagulation studies. For studies inthis proposal, Dr. Wallach has created a stable, sterilizable paucilamellar NPL which is inexpensive,non-toxic and biodegradable. They can also carry a large volume of hemoglobin. The NPL contain 2-4bilayer membranes. A group of investigators has prepared hemoglobin-laden non-phospholipid\"niosomes\" containing diglycerolcetylether, cholesterol, and dicetylphosphate. Dr. Wallach and his grouphave extended different formulations of NPL which can efficiently encapsulate hemoglobin. Forpreparation and characterization of hemoglobin, alpha-alpha crosslinked hemoglobin will be used. Humanstroma-free hemoglobin will be prepared, deoxygenated, and appropriately stored. The hemoglobin willbe encapsulated by their well-established technique, the results being monitored by phase contrast andother microscopy techniques. Viscosity and leakage problems will be appropriately monitored.Hemodynamic testing will be done in Sprague-Dawley rats. Exchanged transfusions will be done andvarious parameters measured.",

        "abstract": "Microcom Corporation and Chaffee Associates propose to design a Time Space Position Information (TSPI) module that will provide Universal Two Stage GPS/INS Integration for Test and Training Range applications. The design will allow combining of data from virtually any GPS receiver with data from any inertial system in a Kalman filter. This method of integrating GPS and INS data will eliminate the need for custom filter design whenever a different GPS receiver and/or INS is used, saving both non-recurring engineering and software development cost. The resulting position, velocity, acceleration, and time data will provide more accurate real-time data to ground station computers and display systems for use by aircraft participating in exercises on test and training ranges. The Phase I study will concentrate on developing and testing software prototypes of universal integration schemes using point estimators based on various norm constraints designed for robustness to outliers, near sufficiency, minimum variance, noise suppression, and mitigation of the effects of large deviations. We will also investigate the hardware aspects of the design including processor type and speed required, interfaces for the GPS receiver and the INS, as well as the overall packaging concept required for either an external pod or internal package. In addition, Microcom will prepare a design plan and submit a preliminary system design specification which will be the basis for development, test, and qualification of a Universal Two Stage GPS/INS Integrated Time Space Position Information (TSPI) module.",

We have found that laserablation is enhanced when tissue are pretreated with microdrops of dye, nominally 50um in diameter.The use of dye to couple the laser energy to the tissue has two advantages: (i) energy absorption isgoverned by the optical characteristics of the dye (not the tissue), thus the new-generation of cheap,compact diode laser can be harnessed to surgical task; (ii)because surgeons can \"paint\" the tissue withbrief burst of dye prior to each laser shot, they gain a new dimension of interactive control over theirlaser's impact on tissue. Our instrument combines a miniature, solid-state fluid microdispenser, basedon ink jet printing technology, and a laser fiber in a slim, endoscopic instrument. In Phase I of theresearch we will (i) evaluate various dyes, including lipophilic, \"sticky\" dyes for surgical use, (ii) explorehow the fundamentals of laser-tissue interaction (thermal diffusion, photoacoustic effects) are modifiedb use of dyes and (iii) assess the clinical efficacy (ablation efficiency vrs tissue damage) of selectedlaser-dye combinations.

A new type of mathematicalanalysis and reconstruction procedure based on a modified nonlinear time-frequency distribution will beused to generate a factorization of spin density and motion effects without he problems of lowresolution, interference terms and noise sensitivity of previous methods. The method will also avoid theuse of motion models or assumptions about the complexity of the motion. Preliminary results suggestthe feasibility of the approach, which uses a special pulse sequence and novel reconstruction processing,not available in other approaches or systems.

Although tumors differ from normal tissue pathologically, there are no significantdifferences in gross physical properties up to the point when it becomes palpable. Therefore, the threemajor medical modalities have not demonstrated anticipated success in identifying small tumors.Procedural costs are continually increasing. This proposal concerns the development of a low-cost agentdelivered via venous injection which adheres to tumor vessel walls in large numbers and can act as acontrast agent for all three major modalities, Ultrasound, X-ray and MR Imaging.

Conventional phase shifters employing ferrite or pin diode type components demand relatively high switching and holding currents as compared to the innovative piezo-electric type laboratory prototyped and proposed. Batteries for portable terminals and small satellites are volume and weight overhead support systems which will be substantially reduced in power requirements using piezo-electric phase shifters in place of the more conventional high power draining phase control devices. Significant power savings with the Piezo-electric phase shifter as compared to conventional types is projected, especially where high array element quantities are involved. Continuous phase shifting is possible as opposed to the discrete types which result in phase step loss. The project result is the breadboard of a 2 element steerable array using piezo-electric phase shifters. Scan Patterns versus continuous phase shifter will be measured.

        "abstract": "This proposed effort utilizes an existing DoD technology, known as a traveling wave tube (TWT), as a broadband, high-power plasma source. The TWT will permit optimization of processing parameters over a frequency range larger and wider than has previously been examined and will allow optimum, real-time control of the process parameters. This source technology will be combined with a water-based diamond deposition chemistry, which offers considerable advantages over traditional hydrogen-methan chemistries in both safety and manufacturing cost. The goal of this proposed effort is to develop a TWT-based flexible diamond manufacturing process tool. Previous work by MLI -- in cooperation with the Research Triangle Institute -- has already demonstrated that TWTs can be used to generate high-freqency, microwave-excited plasmas for diamond deposition at fixed frequencies. This Phase I effort will demonstrate controlled, variable-frequency operation. This proposed effort will couple microwave energy from a TWT into a cylindrical cavity and use variable frequency operation to raster the plasma along the surface of a carbon composite sample -- thereby demonstrating the feasibility of controlling the efficienty deposition of diamond films over unique geometries. Anticipated Benefits: Diamond films have properties -- e.g., thermal conductivity, chemical inertness, abrasion resistane -- which meet the requirements of a variety of military, space, and commercial applications: scratch-resistant coatings, wear-resistant high-speed bearings, heat sinks and thermal management devices, and anti-corrosion protection. Successful demonstration of plasma spatial rastering has the potential to revolutionize many CVD and CVI technologies and processes.",

Combining an existing production technology with an innovative application of DoD Traveling Wave Tube (TWT) technology will enable an increase in the production rate of thermoset PMC products -- significantly reducing the cost of finished parts. PMCs are a leading component in the expanding field of advanced materials; however, applications are often limited by the processing speed -- particularly in the post-curing steps. The use of the proposed variable frequency technology for the post-curring of isocyanate/epoxy mixtures will lead to faster curing than in possible using conventional heating methods and more uniform curing than is possible using other microwave heating methods. The technical approach of the Phase I effort will be to use an existing prototype variable frequency microwave furnance available at MLI, which is capable of providing up to 200 Watts of CW microwave power over the 2.4 to 7.5 GHz frequency range. Near-production-scale plates of the thermoset PMC material (20 cm by 20 cm by 2.5 mm thick) will be provided by EniChem America, Inc., which will support MLI in this effort. Characterization and optimization of the variable frequency microwave heating properties of the material will proceed along two primary lines of inquiry: (1) the effect of material thickness on processing speed and uniformity and (2) the effect of frequency range of processing uniformity. The final technical objective of the Phase I effort will be to demonstrate uniform heating of the near-production-scale thermoset PMC plates. Anticipated Benefits: Potential applications for the variable frequency microwave furnace technology include polymer and epoxy curing, ceramic sintering, microwave-assisted CVD and CVI, and the processing of a wide range of advanced materials. Potential applications for thermoset PMCs include structural reaction injection molding, electrical insulation, rigid foams, and any polymer process which requires fast polymerization.",

The superthermal hydrogen atoms are produced by electron impact dissociation of hydrogen gas in a dense plasma generated in a novel type of a microwave ECR discharge recently developed by the principal investigator. The atoms have a thermal distribution with a temperature of several eV and a flux density in the order of 1 A/cm2 equivalent. The energy of the neutral superthermal atomic hydrogen beam is similar to the hydrogen ion energy in a successful mirowave ECR plasma processing tool, and the beam intensity is higher than the ion current density of currently available plasma processing tools. The energy range of the atoms may be high enough for chemical reactions at low surface temperature, and at the same time low enough to prevent bombardment induced damage and hydrogen diffusion into the bulk. There is no charge induced damage since neutral particles are used. Since no chrorofluorocarbons are used, this method addresses current environmental concerns. In Phase I etchin of oxides, especially removal of the native oxide from silicon, will be demonstrated. Etching of carbon and silicon will be also investigated. In Phase II an atomic hydrogen beam system will be developed for cleaning of large wafers. Anticipated Benefits: Exploration of a new etching/cleaning technology based on utilization of superthermal hydrogen beams.

The embedded magnetic particles will add magnetostrictive properties to the rubber mount that can be used to enhance the passive or active isolation characteristics of the mount. The use of rubber mounts is the preferred engineering approach to isolate mechanical systems from vibration and shock and design engineers are always looking for improved mounts. Magnetostriction is the phenomena characterized by a material changing its length when placed in electro-magnetic field. The process is reversible, that is; the material generates an electro-magnetic field when it is deformed by external forces. These properties allow magnetostrictive materials to be used as sensors or actuators. Unfortunately current magnetostrictive materials (Terfenol-D) are mechanically stiff and cannot accommodate the large displacements required for isolation mount applications. In Phase 1, the MARIM program will investigate the feasibility of adding magnetostrictive properties to rubber isolation mounts. Feasibility of this novel concept will be studied by investigating possible fabrication techniques, resulting electrical and mechanical properties, the application envelope, passive and active control concepts, and a design methodology. Phase I will also prepare a preliminary design for prototyping in Phase II. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - With a MARIM mount, component and system life can be extended, system availability can be increased, component cost can be reduced, maintenance expenditures can be lowered and system performance can be improved. A MARIM has wide application in military, civil, and commercial vehicles and associated equipment.

        "abstract": "A novel approach for controlling weld bead penetration is proposed. The methodology is distinguished from past techniques by use of: 1) a new and more accurate model of the weld pool dynamic behavior, 2) an improved method of sensing the weld pool oscillations, 3) a more efficient method of weld pool excitation, and 4) a model-based relation of pool dynamics, weld pool geometry, and equipment parameter settings. Application of the proposed technique allows control of the weld bead penetration in both the full and partial penetration cases. The proposed weld pool dynamic model uses a droplet formulation for describing the pool oscillation, in contrast purpose. The optical sensing methodology uses an improved sensor for increased signal quality and amplitude. Two techniques for implementing and controlling the excitation of the weld pool are outlined in the proposal. In both cases the pool is continuously excited at its natural resonant frequency and the excitation frequency changes. Excitation at the resonant frequency alows maximum excitation with minimum input energy. In addition to its proposed use for weld penetration monitoring and control, the resonant oscillations caused by the system can be used to enhance pool stirring and thus control other aspects of the weld, such as grain size and orientation. This system would be particularly applicable to the rigorous control requirements necessary for the welding of exotic alloys used in aircraft and aerospace construction. Anticipated Benefits: The proposed techniques can be implemented as generic weld penetration monitoring devices, making automatic penetration control feasible and practical. The utility of such devices is very broad and can be utilized in a variety of commercial applications.",

Traditional beam scanning is usually done mechanically or with a phased array. Mechanical scanning is cumbersome and often requires large amounts of power. Phased array beam scanning is lossy at millimeter wavelengths and and becomes very difficult due to the size and tolerancing in the phase circuitry. Other considerations are cost and reliability. In all of these areas quasioptical beam scanning offers significant advantages at millimeter wavelengths. In Phase I, we propose to study and design a monolithic beam steering array for implementation in one of our imaging systems during Phase II. After the design is complete, we will build and test a hybrid model at the end of Phase I. During the study we will consider the impact of substrate material and type of diode on the system requirements. The modeling of a monolithic beam steering array will be carried out on existing in-house software. When the design is in place we will build a hybrid prototype for testing at 94 GHz. This test device will serve as a basis for the Phase II effort, which will comprise building a monolithic beam steering array for use in one of our imaging systems.

The sensor will detect obstacles 5 to 30 feet in front of the vehicle with a height greater than the suspension travel of the vehicle. The detectability of such sensors has often been a deterrent to their use, however, this can greatly be reduced by operating at a millimeter-wave frequency where the atmospheric attenuation is very high (>14 dB/km). Operation at such a frequency would have little effect on the sensor's performance at such a close range yet makes it virtually undetectable a few hundred meters away. Phase I will include a comparison study of this technology versus electrooptical and ultrasonic sensors as well as a detalied requirements definition, concpet devleopment, and concept verification tasks. In preparation for Phase II, an optional task will be to reconfigure existing Millitech instruments to measure returns from common terrain obstacles. This task will provide the confidence in the approach to be followed in the Phase II prototype development.",

        "abstract": "Millitech proposes to develop subsystem module and component technology for millimeter wave interrogators and responders for use in IFF systems. The friendly fire casualities suffered by US and British forces during Operation Desert Storm are recent reminders of this unpleasant fact of warfare. Technology is now available, however, to largely eliminate the friendly fire problem. The IFF system consists of two major subsystems: a weapon-associated interrogator and a potential target-associated responder. The interrogator, co-boresighted with the weapon's sight, is used to interrogate the target and determine that target's allegiance. The rsponder, located on the asset to be protected, responds to a valid interrogation code with an encoded transmission. A valid response received at the interrogator identifies the asset as a friendly. Millimeter wavelengths offer significant advantages for one or both links in an IFF system. The short wavelength compared to microwave and longer wavelengths allow for higher resolution interrogators of suitable size. The ability to penetrate battlefield obscurants is a major advantage relative to IR and shorter wavelengths. During Phase I, several system approaches will be evaluated against predetermined criteria and proof of concept component and module hardware designed. Fabrication and testing of this hardware is proposed as an option.",

        "abstract": "Over the last 2 decades, Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) technology has offered the promise of achieving a breakthrough in the remote sensing of underground targets. Despite high expectations and definite advances, however, the full promise of GPR remains to be fulfilled. The proposed project is an effort to apply an innovative GPR technique and specialized signal processing to achieve a significant advance in GPR performance. The innovative GPR technique uses a spotlight mode SAR to achieve more energy on subsurface targets. The specialized processing technique involves fully coherent signal processing and customization of the SAR matched-filter by using a priori knowledge of target scattering characteristics. The intent of the spotlight mode SAR and specialized signal processing is to increase the processed signal gain of the GPR system to enhance detection and target recogni- tion of subsurface targets. The Phase I effort will leverage an existing instrumentation GPR owned by Mirage Systems to perform an experiment to quantify the benefits of the innovative GPR approach and specialized processing. The objectives of the Phase I effort are to establish the feasibility of the proposed techniques, quantify the processing benefits, and specify processor requirements for practical GPR systems. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - Potential national security benefits of this R&D include enhanced GPR detection and recognition of buried targets such as mines, ordnance, arms/drug caches, cross-border tunnels, bunkers, and nuclear/toxic waste containers. Potential commercial applications are within the environmental and construction industries by providing GPR products that can perform safe, low cost subsurface site surveys required prior to starting remediation or construction activities.",

Properly fabricated optical sensors may even provide continued use a senors in smart structures, providing useful feedback on part temperature, mechanical strain or vibration, and chemical attack. Embedded sensors can even provide a vehicle for assessing structural damage by directly detecting crack propagation or delamination, or by providing an avenue for internal investigation of part integrity using various non-destructive inspection methods. Under the proposed program, a technical evaluation will be made of the techniques in which Fourier Transform Near-Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy methods (Raman or otherwise) are used to remotely monitor cure kinetics in composite structures via embedded fiber optics.

The instrument performs chemometric analysis on infrared spectra to identify blood chemical concentrations. Key features of the instrument are its portability, low-power consumption, and the ability to program it for a specific application. Technology originally developed for military infrared sensors and for testing such sensors, now available for dual-use purposes, makes the instrument a practical reality. Phase I of the program will focus on performance analysis and preliminary design of the sensor. One application area to be considered is non-invasive monitoring of blood chemistry, in particular, glucose monitoring in diabetic patients. The other application involves \"on the scene\" invasive blood chemical analysis for identification of poisions, abused drugs, and chemicals present in battlefield environments. Anticipated Benefits: A non-invasive blood glucose monitor would benefit the approximately 2.5 million American that suffer diabetes mellitus. Progress in the field of artificial organs, such as the artificial pancreas, depends on the availability of this type of miniaturized sensor to continuously monitor blood chemistry.

        "abstract": "Clandestine testing of prototype devices is a high priority for a developing nuclear weapons. A deterrent against proliferation of nuclear weapons can be detection of such tests. Limited technical capabilities of developing nations mean clandestine weapons tests may be detonated slightly above or below a land or water surface. However, there exists a substantial literature conceming signatures and detection methodologies available to any government. It is assumed that clandestine tests will be used to avoid detection by conventional methods. Observable signatures of nuclear explosions include: Optical, Seismic, Hydroacoustic, Acoustic, Ionospheric and satellite sensor detected EMP. For near-surface configurations, some of these signatures may be at variance from standard tests. Selection of local clandestine test environment by a knowledgeable party can reduce the probability of detection. Optical signatures can be degraded by shallow burial in water or soil; hydroacoustic signals from shocks and bubble pulsations will be altered by near-surface bursts; seismic, EMP and acoustic signatures are also changed by depth. We will provide a preliminary determination of optimal means of simultaneous evasion of multiple detection systems by choice of depth/height in available media using existing calculational capabilities. We will indicate possible approaches to mitigation of such evasion. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - Quantification of optimal test detection evasion techniques likely to be employed by nuclear proliferators will allow orientation of existing or future fielded monitoring methods to be configured or developed for mitigation and promotion of the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons.",

        "abstract": "QUANTITATIVE STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIP (QSAR) ANALYSIS IS THE AREA OF RESEARCH WHICH TRIES TO BUILD SUCH COMPUTATIONAL MODELS OF BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY USING THE PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF A COMPOUND.  THE BASIC ASSUMPTION IS THAT THE VARIATIONS OF BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY WITHIN A SERIES OF SIMILAR STRUCTURES CAN BE CORRELATED WITH CHANGES IN EXPERIMENTAL OR COMPUTATIONAL PARAMETERS OF THE MOLECULES.  THESE PARAMETERS COULD MEASURE, FOR EXAMPLE, HYDROPHOBIC, STERIC, AND ELECTRONIC PROPERTIES WHICH MAY INFLUENCE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY.  IN THIS PROCESS, A DATA TABLE IS FORMED WHERE EACH ROW REPRESENTS A CANDIDATE COMPOUND, AND EACH COLUMN A COMPUTATIONAL OR EXPERIMENTAL PROPERTY.  STANDARD REGRESSION ANALYSIS IS APPLIED TO THIS DATA TABLE TO CREATE A MODEL OF ACTIVITY BASED ON THE PARAMETERS.  THE GENETIC FUNCTION APPROXIMATION (GFA) ALGORITHM OFFERS A NEW APPROACH TO THIS PROBLEM.  RESEARCHERS ARE REPLACING STANDARD REGRESSION ANALYSIS WITH THE GFA ALGORITHM IN THE QSAR TASK.  THIS ALLOWS THE CONSTRUCTION OF HIGHER-QUALITY PREDICTIVE MODELS, EVEN WITH DATA SETS THAT MAY HAVE THOUSANDS OF PARAMETERS.  INITIAL STUDIES USING GFA SHOW THE ALGORITHM IS CAPABLE OF BUILDING MODELS WHICH MEET OR EXCEED THE PREDICTIVE ABILITY OF THE BEST PUBLISHED MODELS.  THE ALGORITHM IS ABLE TO OUTPERFORM NOT ONLY STANDARD REGRESSION ANALYSIS IN THIS AREA, BUT ALSO NEWER ALGORITHMS BASED ON PLS OR NEURAL-NETWORKS.  RAPID COMMERCIALIZATION OF THIS TECHNOLOGY WOULD LEAD TO A POWERFUL NEW QSAR TOOL, AND COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT IN THE ABILITY OF QSAR TOOLS TO AID CHEMISTS IN DRUG DESIGN, AND THUS REDUCE THE CURRENT DEPENDANCE ON EXCESSIVE TESTING DURING DRUG DEVELOPMENT.",

        "abstract": "Bioremediation holds great promise for cost effective treatment of environmental contaminants. To realize this potential, microorganisms with improved bioremediation capabilities must be found. A general systematic approach is described to use 96-well microtiter plate technology and robots to screen rapidly microorganisms for their bioremediation capabilities. Microbial strains will be grown in 96-well microtiter plates and robotically screened for binding or detoxification of toxic metals. An EPA colorimetric assay will be implemented on the robot for Cr(VI) and microbial strains screened for detoxification or binding of Cr(VI). Physiological conditions will be parameterized for selected strains for both bioreactors and in situ applications. In Phase II, the robotic screening will be expanded to screen approximately 10,000 bacterial strains and test the bioremediation traits for additional metals, including radionuclides. The scale of the work is only possible using robots. The most promising strains will be tested for metal binding or detoxification in shaker flask experiments and bench scale bioreactors systems with flowthrough of contaminated groundwater. The research will produce a library of 10,000 microorganisms indexed by bioremediation capabilities, and cross-indexed by bioreactor conditions and operating constraints.",

Molecular Tool's commercial goal is to developflexibly formatted solid-phase GBA arrays that can simultaneously identify diagnostic, prognostic andtherapeutic applications for a large number of CF mutations. The biochemical steps in GBA are asfollows: 1) amplification of CF DNA by PCR using modified, exonuclease-resistant primers, 2) generationof a single-stranded template by exonuclease digestion, 3) hybridization of amplified templates to primersimmobilized in microtiter plate wells, 4) incorporation of biotinylated dideoxynucleosides at the site ofthe mutant allele by DNA polymerase, 5) and enzymatic detection of the incorporated bases. Phase Iof this grant aims to: 1) develop GBA reagents for 10 common CF mutations, 2) test these reagents onhuman genomic DNAs, 3) demonstrate the biochemical accuracy and reproducibly of GBA by testing 200coded CF patient DNA samples 3) develop a protype test format. These data will allow accurate analysisof the Phase II development costs and operational features of a range of commercial CF test prototypes.",

With lightweight, low power, GPS receivers, military units in the field can pinpoint their global position with great accuracy. In addition to position data, the GPS constellation of satellites provides altitude, velocity information and accurate time data. This information can be transmitted via datalink to a remote location where a data collection system intgrates the units reported positions with terrain, threat, and target data and displays the scene on the Army's visualization software. This system can enhance the Army's ability to monitor and control field operations, support insertion and extraction missions, indirect fire, communications, and conduct training exercises. GPS and visualization have numerous commercial applications including transit system monitoring, emergency vehicle dispatch and monitoring, geodeteic survey support, and port navigation.",

        "abstract": "The GAO has reported to Congress that the loss due to fraudulent health care activity amounted to an estimated $84 billion in 1992. The ability to detect fraud and abuse is critical to the reduction of health care costs. The claims processing system will soon undergo rapid change with the introduction of rapid payment transaction processing systems. The emphasis on rapid turn around combined with increases in data volume will exacerbate the fraud and abuse detection problem. We propose to prove the feasibility of an automated high speed, pre-pay system for processing claims data to detect instances and patters of fraud and abuse. MRJ developed this technology for classified specail-access projects within the Department of Defense, the Intelligence Community, the Department of Justice, as well as within Department of the Treasury. MRJ has demonstrated the potential of using prallel processing for very high speed analysis of patterns of abuse to the law enforcement community. We will develop the system using knowledge mined from historical claims databases and test its heuristics on actual claims data. Blue Cross/Blue Shield of South Caroline (BCBSSC) has expressed interest (Appendix I) and will provide access to its experts and data. Anticipated Benefits: The goal of the project will be to demonstrate the technical feasibility of an automated high speed near real time, pre-pay system for processing helath care claims data to detect instances and patterns of potential fraud and abuse. The fraud detection technology will also lend itself to other types of fraud -- auto insurance, life insurace, phone fraud, mail fraud, etc.",

Novel visualization techniques will be explored to identify tools capable of aiding in the discrimination of different types of seismic events, particularly those detected at regional distances out to 2,000 km. Such techniques will include the addition of a third variable to several standard 2-dimensional discriminants to generate 3-dimensional fields which can be analyzed by both 3-D rendering and animation. Graphical representations of multi-variate statistical analysis, including principal component analysis, will also be evaluated for their discrimination capabilities. The system will be developed primarily for a Silicon Graphics machine, using X-Window and GL graphics. Several commercial visualization software products will be evaluated for possible integration into the system. A modular design for the data input and output and the visualization tools will result in a system which can be easily tailored to other multi-dimensional data problems.

        "abstract": "Computer-based training simulations can do more than teach facts and specialized skills, they can help students learn the high level skills involved in finding and evaluating information, solving problems, cooperating with colleagues, and resolving conflicts. While the simulators used to train pilots or tank crews are very expensive, a new generation of authoring tools will enable low-cost development of many broadly-used training and education simulations. The new simulations will use personal computers and will build on evolving work on digital libraries and multimedia techniques. The new authoring tools incorporate knowledge-based techniques for model-based simulation, automated planning, and concept-based information retrieval. Military applications have demonstrated successful applications of these knowledge-based techniques. Authoring tools that package these techniques will allow trainers to develop simulations that adapt to varying learning levels and accommodate the opportunistic, exploratory behaviors of individual learners. Reuse of the authoring tools, domain knowledge, digital libraries, help modules, and other software components will spread development costs over many simulations and make it cost effective to develop simulations that dramatically extend the effectiveness of training and education software. Anticipated Benefits: Once adaptive simulations are demonstrated and cost effective, the market for PC-based training and instructional materials, which is already growing at 40-50% per year, will explode to reach $10 billion per year. The authoring tools package the knowledge-based technology which is the one remaining technology requirement. Use of adaptive simulations will improve US education and competitiveness.",

Unlike accelerators that attach to a host computer's memory bus, network-based accelerators can be shared by all of the hosts on the network, and can provide continued system operation when nodes or network links have failed. The fine-grain clusters provide very high performance per unit cost, weight, and power; the modularity allows a short system-development cycle; and the programmability allows the system to be modified to meet changing requirements. Myricom has adapted the packet-communication and routing technologies developed originally for scalable, concurrent computers to allow arbitrary-topology networks, long-distance links, and fault-tolerant operation. We propose to examine whether this technology can be applied to distributed computing between conventional computers and clusters of small nodes specialized for tasks such as video storage and retrieval, and signal and image processing. The results of this study will be preliminary hardware designs, a prototype programming system, and an evaluation of the suitability of these systems for multimedia-server and raster-image-processing applications.

A multi-parameter maximum likelihood estimation technique has been shown through simulations to be very effective in antimultipath processing. This approach is based on implementing a multipath estimating delay locked loop (MEDLL). The key to this approach is the formation of a bamk of correlations at narrow spacings over the multipath delay interval. This allows estimation of all multimpath channel parameters over the region of interest. NAVSYS has an advanced GPS receiver (AGR) that utilizes such a bamk or correlators which have programmable tap spacings. The AGR provides an ideal test bed to implement the MEDLL or similar algorithm with multipath correlator bank. There are always certain scenarios in which multipath cannot be isolated.

The number of searches required to resolve ambiguities is significantly reduced over existing techniques. Furthermore, the technique of FDI equivalence is shown to be highly efficient in discarding false ambiguities. These two features of the proposed technique mean that when satellite visibility is good and measurement noise is low, the ambiguities can be resolved immediately after a single measurement from each channel. When visibility is reduced or noise is large, the technique can be enhanced to minimize the number of consecutive measurements required before the ambiguities are correctly resolved. The ambiguity resolution algorithm is designed to operate with an autonomous integrity algorithm developed by NAVSYS which produces a real-time check of the validity of GPS data. This algorithm is capable of performing real-time cycle-slip detection and repair. The performance of the ambiguity resolution algorithm will be enhanced and validated through simulation under the Phase I contract. Under Phase II a prototype system will be delivered for flight tests.",

NAVSYS has designed an innovative tracking system that optimally combines data from both the aircraft and missile sensors. This approach minimizes the required missile electronics while providing a highly accurate integrated GPS/INS solution for enhanced weapon delivery. The missile is installed with a low cost, miniaturized GPS sensor developed for NAVSYS, the TIDGET (tm). In the TIDGET/Inertial Missile (TIM) tracking system, the TIDGET provides periodic \"snapshots\" of GPS and INS data to the aircraft tracking system which optimally processes the missile data using information from both the missile and the aircraft GPS and INS sensors. This method has the following advantages for enhanced weapon delivery: low cost, miniaturized GPS sensor which requires no initialization pre-launch; rapid signal acquisition even in high dynamics (",

The GPLAS ground station includes a GPS reference receiver (RR) and a pseudolite (PL) which broadcasts the landing signal and GPS data corrections to the aircraft. The RR also is used to automatically survey the landing site. Since the PL signal is in the same format as the GPS satellites, the GPS receiver on-board the aircraft can be used to provide precision guidance throughout the approach. The spread-spectrum nature and low power of the PL signal guarantee a low probabilty of intercept (LPI), which is essential for covert applications. NAVSYS is currently under contract to ARPA to build a prototype GPS autolanding systems suitable for UAVs. Under the proposed Phase I efforts, the operational and performance requirements for a PLAS system will be identfied to take full advantage of the V-22 insertion and extraction capabilities. A study will be performed of the best method to integrate the GPLAS with the aircraft and design the ground equipment in support of SOF missions.

This proposal addresses the essential elements of a theoretical and experimental investigation of critical material and fabrication issues related to stencil masks leading to a Phase II proof-of-concept demonstration of the practical feasibility of stencil mask technology. A comprehensive survey of stencil mask materials and process technologies will be made. Key issues will be modeled theoretically; they include pattern distortion, mask temperature, complementary pattern techniques, and feature wall angles. Three issues will be studied experimentally to verify proofs of concept. The first is in the area of new membrane materials suitable for ion masks. The second is in the selection, availability, and bondability of new, stiffer frames. The third is in the demonstration of high lifetime of ion masks fabricated from new materials. The final task of the program is to bring together the survey and the theoretical and experimental studies and then select the materials and processes to be used in a Phase II mask technology demonstration of stable, low-distortion, and high-pattern-density stencil masks. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - The development of a technology for fabricating stable, low-distortion stencil masks is expected to help create strong c(xiottercial interest for projection lithography and firmly establish a leadership position for the U.S. in projection lithography mask-making for sub-0.18-micrometer integrated circuits, such as 1 Gbit DRAMS, as well as quantum devices, integrated optical devices, and other nanostructures.",

So far, most of the microwave HTS demonstration components have been in the form of hybrid distributed circuits. Major further application advances are believed to be possible through the eventual use of HTS lumped elements. In this SBIR, we propose to demonstrate the feasibility of the first HTS tri-layer structure using a low-e dielectric and operating at microwave frequencies. The proposed lump LC test structure is expected to demonstrate high quality growth of dielectric layer and a subsequent HTS layer on top of a tapered lower HTS film, while maintaining good microwave surface resistance in both HTS layers. Such a configuration is essential to a number of microwave circuit configurations, including lumped capacitors and cross-overs. If successful, it will form the basis for more advanced circuit processing technique that eventually will also involve the patterning of the dielectric and the forming of interconnections between the two HTS layers in the subsequent Phase II. Ultimately, this technology may permit the integration of lumped HTS circuits with conventional MMIC circuits. OPTION TASK: $20,000",

The major drawback of these circuits to date is the lack of high-Q components. High dielectric-constant, low-loss layers show great promise to overcome this limitation. Such moderately thick layers when patterned and integrated into the GaAs substrate structure of MMIC devices could perform a number of important high-Q functions such as filters, matching transformers, delay lines, resonators for low phase noise oscillators, etc. Phase I of this SBIR has the goal to demonstrate the basic feasibility of depositing a high-Q material on GaAs, patterning it and forming a miniature low loss transmission line compatible with standard MMIC device processes. A study of possible microwave and millimeter wave applications of this technology will also be performed that will provide the basis for future deposition and process refinements and the development of miniature high-Q components during a subsequent Phase II effort. The successful development of a high dielectric constant material deposition and patterning technology will permit the integration of miniature high-Q components directly into GaAs wafers and thus greatly extend the capability of today's monolithic circuits. This technology is expected to show major benefits for mmW spaceborne communications applications where weight, size and performance are of primary importance.

        "abstract": "This is a proposal to develop and market a verification and inspection tool for MCM substrates. By reducing the risk of mounting good die on to defective MCM substrates, a significant reduction in cost and improvement in the yield and reliability of populated MCMs can be realized. A tool which detects potential problems during substrate manufacture, reduces substrates verification time, enhances substrate rework capabilities, and hence reduces the risk of mounting known good die on defective susbstrates has generic applicability to virtually all module types and will have essentially zero impact on module resources and performance. Recent developments in high temperature superconducting device technologies have enable the construction and testing of microscopes which are capable of detecting the magnetic fields associated with currents flowing in this metallic films. By analyzing the magentic fields, an image of the conductor responsible for the production of the fields is obtained. The overall goal of this SBIR program is to market a high temperature superconducting magnetic microscope dedicated to the inspection and verification of MCM substrates in a manufacturing environment. Anticipated Benefits: The anticipated benefit of the proposed research is the establishment and commercialization of the magnetic microscope as an inspection tool for MCM substrates. Incorporation of the microscope shoudl improve the yield, reduce the cost, and enhance the reliability of multichip modules.",

        "abstract": "The traditional modulation techniques employed on satellite links are based on the second-order spectrum of the modulation wave form. In this proposal, we explore the utility and performance of modulation schemes based on higher-order cumulant sequences and the associated frequency-domain representations called polyspectra. These generalizations of correlation sequences and power spectra possess many interesting properties which have been shown to be useful in a number of applications. To date, little effort has been made to determine the extent to which these properties can be exploited to facilitate communication over digital channels. In Phase I of this work, we will study the properties and advantages of several bispectrum modulation techniques, and we will demonstrate that this approach can provide protection from jamming on satellite channels. A question of considerable interest, which we will address, is whether this technique can support a higher data rate than traditional anti jamming techniques. Anticipated Benefits: The major anticipated benefit of this effort is the development of new modulation techniques that can support satellite communicaion links with a high data rate in a jamming environment. Additional expected benefits are improved communications over channels with linear distortion, and a new multiaccess modulation scheme for multiuser communication networks. Potential commercial applications include satellite communications and cellular mobile telephone systems.",

Our innovation, application of the immune neural network, utilizes principles of the biological immune system and genetic algoritms. The proposed ontogenic system is analogous to the immune system in that it copies the immune system design of having a constant and variable portion of the antigen. The first part is a constant neural network that is trained initially from what is known about the system to arrive at basic neural network components similar to biological gene structures. Once the components are identified, the system is frozen and a variable part of the system is trained. Genetic algorithms operate on the neural network building blocks to create more fit combinations of these components. The evaluation function determines which members of a new generation will be allowed to survive and replicate. In a relatively short time, the GA composes a neural network architecture which is quite good at solving the mapping problem it is designed to solve. Our application uses the INN system to learn to fuse data from disparate sensor sources into a unified information system for control of NASA spacecraft subsystems.",

We propose to apply the wavelet transform, fractals, and neural networks independently in all three dimensions to reduce the computational complexity of coding while achieving high rates of compression.

A unique feature will be the incorporation of a novel parallel simulation paradigm that exploits efficient sharing of data and instructions across simulation runs, rather than attempting to parallellize the execution of a single run. The project goals include (1) a functional description of the complete software environment with emphasis on highly interactive features and visualization, and (2) a demonstration of the above novel paradigm whereby execution and management of multiple simulations is expected to provide orders of magnitude speedup. Anticipated Benefits: Simplify the development and operation of discrete event simulation software and significantly reduce its cost.

        "abstract": "Cerebral ischemia as a consequence of stroke often produces irreversible brain damage andpermanent functional disability. There is presently no practical treatment for such ischemic brain injury.Certain neurotrophic proteins have been shown to have beneficial neuroprotective effects whenadministered after experimental stroke in laboratory animals, but these proteins are unlikely to be usefultherapeutic agents; they cannot be delivered expeditiously to stroke-affected brain regions because ofexclusion by the blood brain barrier. We have developed two candidate neuroprotective agents whichit feels will be of great practical value in this area. The neuroprotective activity of these agents has beendemonstrated in vitro, and evidence indicates that they will gain access to the brain after-systemicadministration. We will outline a research program intended to demonstrate the efficacy of these agentsin protecting against ischemia-induced brain injury in vivo. Gerbils will be subjected to cerebral ischemiaby carotid artery occlusion and treated with NMI's candidate neuroprotective agents. The agents'efficacy will be determined by monitoring behavior known to be influenced by ischemic brain injury andby histological analysis of key regions of the gerbil brains.",

The objective of this project is to evaluate a unique form of auricular TENS, which appliessine-wave constant alternating current bilaterally to the conchae of the ears, as a method for alleviatingthe signs and symptoms of narcotic withdrawal in chronic narcotic users who are undergoingdetoxification. An initial pilot study (Phase I) will identify the parameters of stimulation (i.e., frequency)for optimal effect, and subsequent studies (Phase II) will compare TENS of these parameters withmethadone in terms of their ability to attenuate signs and symptoms of narcotic withdrawal. The resultsof this project may lead to the use of this form of TENS as a nonpharmacologic, nonaddictive alternativeto methadone in narcotic detoxification.",

The insect steroid molting hormone, ecdysone, and its receptor(EcR) is of particular interest because of its essential role in development, its presence and biologicaleffects in nematodes, and its absence from parasitic nematode hosts. Study of the nematodeEcR-regulated genes will stimulate the development of anti-molting drugs and vaccine candidates. UsingEcR-specific reagents and the highly conserved nature of the NHR superfamily, the existence of EcRhomologs will be determined for Dirofilaria immitis, dog heartworm, and the free living nematode,Caenorhabditis elegans.

Based on the currently available technologies we expect to be able to display 3D images of 128 x 128 x 128 voxels at 30 times/sec. Besides no moving parts and high voxel bandwidth, additional advantages of the approach are wide angle of view, flexibility in displaying format, and without the reqirement of viewing spectacles. The markets of 3D display are sizable (about $500 Billion) and applications are numerous, including both military (e.g. battle management, air traffic control) and commercial (e.g. medical imaging, scientif computing, video games, etc.). Upon completion of Phase 1, a solid foundation for prototype of a 3D display system will be built.",

The results of the research performed to date has been impressive and we feel warrants the further research and development of this technology. Potential applications for the projectiles include air to ground ammunition, air to air ammunition, large penetrators and fragmentation devices.

This projectwould demonstrate the feasibility of applying refrigeration to the study of biological materials usingsurface techniques. By designing and installing a prototype system in a spectrometer and analyzingfrozen samples, a straight-forward demonstration of this capability is possible. Sufficient dat a wouldbe obtained to determine the viability of the hybrid technology.

Core is no longer suited to space applications because of its large form factor, weight, low density and high power requirements. MRAM is a semiconductor based memory with all the attributes of core (nonvolatile, no wearout, fast R/W, inherently rad-hard, temperature insensitive), and none of the drawbacks. MRAM can be as dense as DRAM, is low power, and has the ruggedness and light weight of monolithic semiconductors, making it the ideal memory for use in tough environments seen by tactical, space, and strategic military systems. The Phase I effort is to modify an existing 1 Megabit MRAM design, to make it suitable for the extreme environment of core memory replacement (space application). Phase II would include layout of the modifications, design verification, two preproduction processing runs of the chips, and testing. The objective is development of a production ready 1-Meg chip.

These GMR materials give an additional significant advantage in area because they have two to three times higher sheet resistivities. Memory circuit architectures, modes of operation and other design considerations for MRAM using these GMR materials will be explored in Phase I, and a GMR memory cell will be demonstrated which circuit simulations will show to be suitable for a 256Kbit MRAM with an access time of 20ns to 40ns.

The main idea is to incorporate device packaging into the device fabrication process so that the packaging can, to a large extent, be conducted in batch process. However, this new integration concept becomes practical and advantageous only if it does not disturb the device design and complicate the entire process. To implement such an idea, we invent a new technology, solid phase fusion (SPF), which can fuse III-V epilayers and devices to a number of patterned, nonplanar substrates including silicon. The SPF process can be conducted at a relatively low temperature and create reliable covalent bonding between the III-V material and the silicon substrate. Preliminary data showed that the SPF technology may be more flexible and reliable than the prevalent technologies such as flip-chip bonding and epitaxial liftoff. We will apply the SPF technology to integrate photonic device arrays with single mode fiber arrays to facilitate the light coupling for multi-channel transmitters and receivers. We will also use the SPF technology to integrate optical devices with their electronic circuits for multi-channel E/O and O/E conversions. Anticipated Benefits: If successful, our research will provide a viable appraoch to fabricating low cost, compact, single and multi-channel optoelectronic modules. These modules will be used in optical communication networks such as optical LAN, MAN, and fiber-in-the-loop (FITL), and will be important for optical interconnects and computer networks.",

This development will require advances in pulse transformers, and improvements in pulsed power switching and capactitive energy storage. Advances in all 3 areas will be tested by building a 300 kV, 300 A pulsed power system capable of fitting into a box 8\"x8\"x24\" in size. The pulse transformer will be a particular focus of this effort because the short HPM pulses require very fast risetimes along with significant reductions in size and weight. BLT thyratrons and higher voltage Barium Titanate capacitors will also be tested. The final pulse generator will be deliverable to the Phillips Lab, and will be the precursor for a 300 MW system in Phase II.",

This process will use no filters or other expendibles and operate at micro- or partial gravity. It will provide hygiene and possibly potable water depending on influent quality. Our concept innovatively exploits the unique biology of Dictyostelium. While executing its life cycle, Dictyostelium converts, its food, a range of microbiota, into cellulose and protoplasm. In liquids, the Dictyostelium ameba stage actively feeds and divides until its food is exhausted without completing its life cycle. Culmination occurs only on solid surfaces where it differentiates into the mature cellulose-containing stage. Since a reliable waste reclamation method allowing for successful long term manned missions is an essential component of a regenerative life support system, the innovation is relevant and important.",

        "abstract": "In situ immunological and DNA probe-based histochemical detection methods have widespread,important biomedical applications in infectious and genetic disease diagnosis, neurobiology,developmental biology, pharmacology and other research. However, radioisotopic detection remains thepredominant method of histochemical detection, thus denying researchers the same advantages thatnon-isotopic methods have offered in other applications. To address this problem, we have beguninvestigating a novel approach to non-isotopic histochemical labeling and detection based on the uniqueinteraction of components of a low molecular weight signaling system. This detection system wouldoffer several advantages over existing methods, including greatly enhanced sensitivity, lower reagentcost, simplified procedures, and significantly improved reagent stability. To establish the feasibility ofdeveloping such a system, Phase I studies will focus on development of substrates that enable detectionof the unique ,high affinity interactions described above, optimization of methods for preparingconjugates to detect the interactions, and preliminary testing of conjugate sensitivity. Phase II will focuson applying the system for in situ applications to detect infectious agents such as HHV-6. In Phase IIl,we will complete development of a user friendly clinical diagnostic test, and will commercialize specificresearch product applications resulting from the research.",

We will pursue the creationof a framework for training a neural network to predict the toxic and carcinogenic properties ofchemicals using data stored in the Organ Toxicity Database. The neural network will be trained torecognize patterns and correlations between chemical structure/ substructures, physicochemicalproperties, and toxicologic/carcinogenic findings stored in the electronic compilation of a large subsetof NTP TR and NTP TOX documents. A system which automatically selects the pertinent data fieldsfor accurately predicting toxicity and then trains a neural network will be developed. The ability of theresulting neural network to predict the carcinogenic and toxic properties of known liver and kidneytoxicants and carcinogens will be evaluated during Phase I. If accurate prediction is achieved, we willbuild a generalized framework for extending our techniques to other types of biological and chemicaldatabases during Phase II. The value of many databases will be greatly increased by the availability ofmethods to automatically create neural networks which extract needed information for variousapplications. For example, our toxicity prediction system would reduce the exposure of the generalpublic to possibly hazardous chemicals, would allow chemical manufacturers to quickly determine thehazards of new and existing products, and would save enormous amounts of time and money currentlyspent on animal testing.

Thedevelopment of NMDA antagonists as therapeutants, however, has been hampered by the occurrenceof deleterious side effects such as the impairment of cognition. Studies in our laboratory have identifieda new class of NMDA antagonists termed arylalkylamines which act at a unique site and by a novelmechanism. We have discovered in preliminary experiments that arylalkylamines fail to inhibit theinduction of tetanization-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) at the Schaffer collateral-CAl pyramidalcell synapse and, therefore, are the first class of potent and selective NMDA antagonists which do notblock LTP induction in this pathway. As LTP may represent the cellular basis for certain forms oflearning and memory, this finding suggests that drugs developed from arylalkylamines may lack effectson cognition. These studies will expand on this preliminary finding by (1) the examination of other,structurally dissimilar, arylalkylamines, (2) and by the utilization of additional, more physiological,patterns of electrical stimulation to elicit LTP. Such studies will aid in our evaluation of arylalkylaminesas lead structures for the development of a new class of therapeutants for neurological disordersdistinguished by their decreased propensity to impair cognition.",

These enzymes utilize thephosphoinositides, in particular phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate [PI (4,5)P2] as substrate.Stimulated hydrolysis of PI (4,5)P2 by PI-PLC generates the two second messengers inositol-1,4,5-trisph-osphate (IP3) and sn-1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) which are implicated in many physiological responsesincluding mitogenesis. PI 3-kinase associates with and is phosphorylated by activated growth factorreceptors and oncogene products which manifest protein-tyrosine kinase activity. It phosphorylatesPI(4,5)P2 specifically at the D-3 hydroxyl to produce PI(3,4,5)P3 which is the putative novel and criticalsecond messenger of growth signals. The overall objective is to develop novel biochemical probes ofmammalian PI-PLC and PI 3-kinase, based on structural analogues of the phosphoinositides carryingreporter groups. During Phase I, the molecular design, synthesis, and characterization of a novel set ofconjugands capable of linking with reporter groups will be addressed. In addition, prototype photoaffinityprobes will be prepared. These probes will be evaluated as substrates and inhibitors in preliminaryassays in collaborative studies with other laboratories. During Phase II, the design of the probes willrefined and studies on PI-PLC and PI 3-kinase will be extended to identify the substrate binding andcatalytic domains, to trace the downstream targets of P 3-kinase products, and to develop substrateanalogues and inhibitors suitable for application in structure-based small molecule drug development.",

The optical readout mechanism is very robust and has a fast access times of sub-nanoseconds. The proposed device is based on a recently discovered ferroelectric-semiconductor interface phenomenon, at Clemson University, which enables ferroelectric thin film to perform nonvolatile binary optical switching. The device is inherently non-destructive, fast and low in energy consumption. Moreover, the proposed simple device structures are particularly suitable for scale up, therefore very large storage capacity can be realized from this technology. This innovative data storage technology offers the potential of simultaneously overcoming all the limitations which present in the current data storage technologies. ONF-RAMs may be a solution to the quest for nonvolatile random access memory (RAM) devices of even higher density, higher read/write rate and non-destructive readout. In this Phase I program,, NZ Applied Technologies,, in collaboration with Prof. G. Haertling of Clemson University will investigate the feasibility of developing this technology by demonstrating a preliminary prototype 64bits memory via an innovative plasma- enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD).

Vulnerability assessment studies model the interaction of a sortie - perhaps using several weapons - with a target. A single vulnerability assessment study requires the results from lhundres or thousands of independent attack scenarios wun with varying input parameters. Vulnerability assessments can be parallelized at two levels. First, it is possible to distribute the individual scenarios required to perform a single study across a network of computers. Distributing scenarios creates a need for coordination and load balancing. Second, the loop that generates the various simulated interactions can be parallelized using several different approaches. Parallelizing the code internally may require a considerable rewriting of an existing code or even the development of new techniques specific to vulnerability assessment. The overall goal of this Phase I research is to develop a recommendaiton concerning the most beneficial approach to speeding up vulnerability assessment studies. Two approaches will be considered: distributing the scenairos of th entire study and parallelizing the interactins within a scenario. Both approaches can be implemented using a variety of technfiques. During Phase I the various techniques will be evaluated and a recommendaiton for parallelizing vulnerability assessment studies will be developed. A limited software prototype that distributes scenarios across a network of workstations will also be implemented. The prototype will rovide experience with using distributed scenarios within a study. Provided that the distributed study can be implementd with a minimum of chnges to the underlying vulnerability assessment code, developing the distributed version will provide the mos immediate benefits of parallelizaiton across a variety of architectures with the least development time and cost.",

        "abstract": "A Phase I SBIR study is proposed of a novel infrared laser configuration employing a coaxial resonant structure and a gyrating electron beam. The center conductor of the structure contains axial ridges that support diffraction radiation induced by the axis-encircling gyrating beam, while the outer conductor of the structure supports radial standing waves that provide feedback to sustain oscillations. The electron beam is to be provided by a recently developed industrial gun that can furnish up to 1 megawatt of high quality beam power at a voltage of up to 100 kV on thin axis-encircling orbits in a moderate guide magnetic field. This novel concept has the potential of providing a compact, voltage-tunable, multi-kilowatt, high duty cycle, coherent, infrared source in the 50-200 micron wavelength range suitable for a variety of civilian and military applications. The proposed Phase I study involves linear and nonlinear theory and numerical simulations to allow design of the structure and its incorporation with the industrial electron gun. Means to maximize the voltage-tunable bandwidth and efficiency will be studied. Results of the Phase I study are to be organized to lead to a Phase II experimental demonstration of the compact tunable infrared grating laser.",

The total situation awareness provided by a JTIDS-equipped tactical community, combined with common extremely repcise navigation and time reference frames directly support the functional capabilities necessary for each of the mission areas under consideration. The primary goals of this program are to define specific cooperataive tactics with supportive Concepts of Operations which demonstrte the uniqu JTIDS mission attributes for each mission area.

        "abstract": "JTIDS waveform suppports multiple simultaneous transmissions by independent terminals operating on parallel subnets within the same geographic area. The designed JTIDS architecture permits up to 128 of these nets to simultaneously operate in aginve area, each with its unigque frequency hopping pattern. As a practical mattter, however, there are several factors which may limit the number of such nets operating concurrently. The primary concern is that of self-interference among the various nts. This interference will aslo degrade the effective anti-jam performance of the JTIDS system. There is a lessss obvious limitation on the number of simultaneious coexisting nets which is rooted in the net management of large dynamic networks. Depending on the connectivitiy requirments of the semi-autonomous coexisting communities which need to exchagne information, available slot resources may not support both the internal and external communication needs. Furthermore, any tow terminals may communicate if and they share at least one common scryptoo-varioable. Therefore, the net managment issue of communication netowrk satruation also includes a crypto-management issue. The absolute number of crypto-variables held by any given terminal is an improtant constraint on the number of participating networks with that terminal. All this will be evaluated during the SBIR effort.",

In vivo experiments in rhesus monkeys indicate that the simianimmunodeficiency virus (SIV) nef is critical pathogenic determinant of this virus. It has recently beenshown that CD4 down-regulation is a common property of HIV-1 nef genes isolated directly fromperipheral blood lymphocytes of HIV-1 infected individuals. In addition, Nef protein from the HIV-1 NL43isolate has a dramatic effect on the development of CD4+ T cells when expressed in transgenic miceand this effect correlates with CD4 down-regulation in thymic T cells. Stable human T lymphoid cellsexpressing this Nef allele display block in interleukin 2 (IL-2) and NF-kappaB T cell receptor-mediatedtranscriptional activation. Since blocking IL-2 activation results in immunosuppression, this observationrepresents a potentially important functional property of Nef. This Nef property has not yet beencorrelated with CD4 down-regulation, nor has it been analyzed using other Nef isolates. We willtransiently express several HIV-1 and HIV-2 primary Nef isolates together with an IL-2 promoter/luciferase and NF-kappaB/luciferase reporter constructs, in human T cell lines, and investigate whetherthe ability to impair the IL-2 and NF-kappaB transcriptional induction in response to stimuli that mimicT cell activation is a general property of functional Nef alleles. Promoter/luciferase reporter assaysrepresent an excellent system for the accurate, automated screening of large number of compounds.If a block in IL-2 induction is a common property of primary Nef isolates, we will establish a cell-basedsystem to search for compounds which inhibit the Nef-mediated block in IL-2 induction, using the uniquehigh-throughput screening system developed at Oncogene Science.",

The chain is extended, and then a detectable antibody conjugate is bound.

Current therapies for these diseases are inadequate as they are plagued with high recurrencerates or adverse side effects. Orally administered passive antibodies targeting H. pylori virulence factorsare an attractive alternative to current treatments because they are inherently safe, pathogen-specificand should eradicate the organism from the host. Herein, Ophidian proposes to purify H. pylori virulencefactors (urease and bacterial cell-surface structures) and raise corresponding high-titer polyclonalantibodies in laying hens. Hen egg antibody has been shown to retain function during passage throughthe gastrointestinal tract and can be readily produce in large quantity. Antibodies will be isolated fromegg yolks, and assessed for urease neutralization activity and ability to prevent H. pylori adher-ence/colonization of CHO cells. A gerbil model will be used to show the effectiveness of theseantibodies in preventing H. pylori infection when orally delivered. The results of this Phase I study showthe feasibility of passive immune therapy to treat H. pylori infections and will provide a betterunderstanding of specific factors related to H. pylori virulence.",

        "abstract": "Multichip modules (MCMs) have allowed the microelectronics industry to produce relatively small, highly-integrated circuitry with performances that far exceeds that of other packaging technologies such as separately packaged ICs soldered onto a printed circuit board. Bare dies are packaged together on a small substrate area, resulting in higher chip densities and shorter interconnects, and therefore allowing for superb clock speeds. In the foreseeable future, the demand will continue for increased integration, improved performance, and smaller footprints with the envisioned circuits incorporating more and more diverse devices and capabilities such as sensors and actuators, diagnostics, and prognostics. Future MCMs will find use in many varied markets extending from the military to the consumer. Optical E.T.C., Inc. proposes to exploit silicon micromachining technology to develop and demonstrate a cost-effective, reliable, and broadly-applicable vertical integration of a multichip module. Phase II efforts would extend development to maximize circuit density and structural robustness, and to address power management issues. Anticipated Benefits: A technology for vertically integrating multichip modules would benefit both military and commercial users. The electronic industry can achieve novel \"Personal\" and highly portable systems by taking advantage of the increased integration, improved performance, and lower footprint offered by a vertically integrated multichip module.",

        "abstract": "In order to protect against eye-damaging laser illumination, poer limiting materials have been developed over the past several years. The effective use of these materials requires that the laser radiation be focused to a small and relatively uniform spot within the material in order to \"trigger\" or activate the material and cuase it to become non-transmissive of the harmful laser light. This requres the incorporation of at least one intermediate focal plant or surface within the optical path, and furthermore, the image quality of this intermediate image must be of adequate quality from an energ density standpoint to be of use. The above task is somewhat straightforward with magnifying sights, binoculars and similar systems. However, it becomes particularly difficult when a unity magnification system is required with a wide field of view. In this SBIR we will develop optical system which provide one and two intermediate images suitable for use with laser limiters. The optical system will operate over an 80 degree field of view at unity magnification. Further, approaches will be investigated to provide two adjacent images of the radiation in order to maximize the efficiency of the limiter.",

Optical gyroscopes have potential to meet these requirements. When the sensitivity requirements is relaxed to 1o/sec, which satisfies most industrial applications, the whole instrument can be built on an integrated optics chip (LiNbO3, for example) of the size of a half-dollar coin. This will simplify the gyro assembly and make it very cheap to mass produce. Previous works on the integrated optic gyro aimed at developing high sensitivity gyros for navigation applications; thus, the gyros built were all resonator-type gyros. Our analysis showed that for industrial applications, however, simpler interferometer-type gyros can be built with sufficient sensitivity. Therefore, we propose here to build an inerferometer-type gyro as the low-cost integrated optic rotation sensor for industrial applications. The goal of this Phase I effort is to achieve a design that meets performance requirements and is mass producible at low cost. Anticipated Benefits: Successful development of this small, reliable, and inexpensive rotation sensor will open up a wide range of industrial, as well as military, applications such as automobile yaw and pitch control, robot arms guidance, active machinery stabilization, and automatic gun aiming.",

        "abstract": "This proposal addresses the problem of identifying a video compression technique appropriate for the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS). The key issues are: (1) JTIDS provides relatively low bandwidths to any individual user and so requires high compression ratios, and (2) the channel itself is inherently noisy. Unlike traditional compression studies we consider the specific issue of compression in the presence of a noisy channel. Joint source coding and channel coding design is proposed to maximize image throughput. Specific algorithms are proposed since they are either part of the National Imagery Transmission Format Standard (NITFS) and therefore mandated, or are potential candidates for inclusion into NITFS. NITFS currently uses JPEG for still frame compression and makes use of decoders which can recover when errors are encountered. Similar techniques can be incorporated in other high compression algorighms, including wavelets and Optivision's own Recursive Block Coding (RBC), which are currently being studied by Kodak for possible inclusion into NITFS. The proposal innovation is to design in Phase I, and implement in Phase II, a visual programming tool allowing the user to construct or modify image compression algorighms and noise models by clicking and dragging processing stages represented as onjects on the screen. This object oriented design is platform-independent and can take advantage of any computational resources present. The tool will be used in Phase II to select compression algorithms for use with JTIDS based on subjective evaluations of the decompressed imagery produced by various compression algorighms when a channel introduces noise.",

Free space optics is uniquely suited to providing such an interconnection because of the high parallelism of the devices and the crosstalk and isolation characteristics. The novelty of this proposal is that we seek to exploit the parallelism of free space for high speed interconnects across distances larger than those realized before for very low latency interconnects. The main technical problems to be addressed on this program are: (1) Development of an understanding of the tradeoffs, at the system level, for different implementation choices for a relatively long, highly parallel, low latency link. Previous analysis have assumed short interconnect (10s of millimeters or less) or did not address high parallelism; (2) Experimental characterization of existing transmitter and receiver designs to enable design of practical arrays of elements. Experimental verification and understanding of the operation of integrated transmitter and receiver arrays will lead to improved designs for larger and faster arrays; and (3) Development of a preliminary design for a low latency, highly parallel link.",

The next generatoion of computer networks will require high bandwidth (> 1Gb/s) and low latency interconnects. The networks should be scalable, modular, and interoperable. We propose a distributed ATM optical interconnect that can meet these requirements. It utilizes byte-wide WDM optical links and photonic switches to simultaneously achieve high bandwidth and low latency. It combines the ShuffleNet architecture with ARM protocols to provide scalability and interoperability. The network will consist of plug-in cards which interface each processor to a fiber-optic ShuffleNet interconnect. Each card will consist of a photonic switch, WDM optical link, ATM protocol processor, and a machine-specific bus interface. We have identified two initial target applications for the distributed ATM optical interconnect. It can be used to network clusters of computers to provide more processing power than any one machine can presently provide. It can also be used to within a multiprocessor computer to interconnect memory modules to processors. In terms of defense technology conversion, this program proposes to take state-of-the art devices developed by JPL under BMDO sponsorship and commercialize the manufacturing process to realize cost-effective high data rate ATM optoelectronic network products. Anticipated Benefits: The distributed ATM optical interconnect proposed here will provide a modular and scalable product for constructing ATM networks.

However, mounting the LVF over the FPA in perfect alignment with the rows of pixel is not easy. The direct deposition of the LVF coatings onto the FPA can simplify the preocess and produce a permanently aligned FPA that can operate with room temperature opto-mechanical systems.

        "abstract": "OPTRA proposes to investigate the sesign of an optical front end for a receiver that converts ultra wide dynamic range, broadband, VLF to HF radio signals into a digital representation and with no loss of significance or resolution. Essential elements of the design are 1) an integrated optical waveguide phase modulator that imparts a phase modulation on an optical beam for a CD type laser diode, a process that is strictly linear with the received signal and 2) an optical process homodyne interferometer and high speed digital phase processor that recovers the phase modulation with shot noise limited sensitivity as a 32 bit wide digital words for subsequent processing by a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) chip based signal processor. An attendant benefit of the optical front end is that it can be remote, e.g., at the antenna site, from the signal processing section through use of low loss, EMI proof optical fibers. In this case, since there are not electrcial signals present at the antenna, e.g., L.O. leakage, it would also be inherently secure.",

        "abstract": "This research addresses critical needs in the areas of electronic control and monitoring of internal combustion engines that require low-cost, durable, accurate, high-temperature viable, and small-size fiber optic pressure sensors for real-time in-cylinder combustion pressure measurement. By employing a novel tapered optical fiber-based sensor design to significantly improve signal modulation levels and by using triple-wavelength0based measurement of optical thin-film interference coating spectral modulations for integrated temperature sensing, we seek to demonstrate a spark plug-integrated and temperature-compensated combustion pressure sensor system that exhibits accuracies better than 2% and operating temperatures up to 550oC. This research addresses high-temperature durability requirements by combining a reliable metal-diaphragm-based design with a hermetically sealed sensor construction. We week to significantly reduce costs of optoelectronic transceivers by developing a low-cost, tapered optical fiber bundle-based coupler design. This approach enables use of low-cost light sources, and alleviates critical alignment requirements. These critical issues have previously hampered fiber optic sensor applications in automotive industry. The multi-wavelength approach compensates for errors induced by factors encountered in an engine setting, such as vibrations, accelerations, and wide ambient temperatures. In Phase I of this research, feasibility of such sensor systems will be demonstrated. Anticipated Benefits: This project will culminate in the development of a low-cost, spark-plug integrated, accurate, durable, error- and temperature-compensated combustion pressure sensor system for internal combustion engine monitoring and closed-loop control applications. The close-loop engine controls based on the in-cylinder pressure information can lead to improved efficiency for fuel saving and pollution reduction, improved reliability, and enormous economical benefits.",

Resulting scores from the realization algorithm, in the form of modal amplitude coherence values, are also included in the classification algorithm to help determine the best combination of sensor data for various bandwidths of modes. The block-Hankel matrix characteristics are determined with the aid of a neural network. The neural network provides the nonlinear mapping between the block-Hankel matrix size characteristics and resulting modal amplitude coherence values.

        "abstract": "Both the bat and the dolphin use high frequency sonar to locate prey. Although these systems are radically different, both require the reception and processing of short duration signals. In recent years, understanding of both the bat and dolphin sonar systems has increased dramatically through the efforts of university and government researchers. Additional progress in parallel computer architectures and neural network processing has now made the design of a bat or dolphin signal processor and classifier feasible. As a result, ARPA now desires the development of such a system consisting of a sonic receiver, signal conditioner, signal processing algorithm and a neural net realization of either the bat or the dolphin. Their intent is to study the echoes produced by both real animals and artificial means to gain insight that might result in either military commercial spin-offs. Our proposed Phase I research will focus primarily on bat biosonar processing because of the availability of more extensive neurophysiological data. We will evaluate candidate processing schemes using simulated bat signals and compare the resulting high-level bat system designs with requirements for dolphin processing. The sonar of the mustached bat will be used to develop a detailed desig the receiver, signal conditioner, processing algorithms, and neural network. Procurement specifications for prototype components will be prepared and all efforts will be documented.

        "abstract": "The Electroencephalogram (EEG) uses a multi-electrode array to measure electrical potentials related to brain activity. It is a low cost non-intrusive technique with diagnostic application to many situations including: battle fatigue, stress, head injury, epilepsy, and sleep disorders. The primary means of EEG analysis today is the manual reading of long paper strip charts of multiple electrode output time series. This is time consuming, costly, and subjective. EEG's are noisy. Signals associated with muscular activity can mask the signals of interest. This SBIR proposes to apply advanced signal and information technology, developed for DoD applications, to problems of EEG analysis. Advanced signal processing and display techniques will be used to enahnce signals and suppress noise to reveal new features. Objective metrics will be developed which can be extracted from the data by machine. This will provide the first step toward automatic screening of large volumes of EEG data. Advanced array processing techniques will be used in conjunction with improved electrical models of the skull to provide localization capability, important in diagnosis of head injury, stroke, epilepsy and brain tumors. The project involves collaboration between ORINCON and Dr. William Peterson, an EEG expert at D.C. General Hospital. ORINCON has developed and successfully applied advanced signal and information processing techniques to a variety of DoD problems under sponsorship of ARPA, the Navy and other agencies. Anticipated Benefits: Application of advanced signal and information processing to EEG data can improve diagnostic accuracy, reduce subjectivity, and reduce the cost of analysis of EEG data. Our goal is to develop an inexpensive PC based system to automatically screen data and assist in diagnosis. There is a large market for this system consisting of the hundreds of military and civilian facilities and hospitals where EEG's are conducted.",

        "abstract": "Changing geopolitical situations add complexity to the ASW task faced by the Navy. Capable submarines are employed by potential adversaries located in difficult acoustic conditions. ASW is turning to active sonar systems to meet the requirements against these targets. Often, multiple active sonars are used in close proximity. There is a need to plan coordinated search efforts that optimize the overall search performance and minimize the negative effects of active sonar mutual interference (MI). The Navy requires an active sonar mutual interference planning tool embedded in existing fleet tactical decision aids. ORINCON is uniquely qualified to develop this system as a result of work currently being done for ARPA's Advanced Undersea Warfare Decision Support Systems (DSS) and ORINCON's extensive knowledge of active systems developed in the Low Frequency Active (LFA) signal processing work for SPARWAR. ORINCON's Strategy for Resource Allocation Through Acoustic, Geographic, and Environmental Metareasoning (STRATAGEM) system will perform acoustic performance diagnostics and provide optimization guidance. Our signal processing knowledge will account for the effects of transmissions from other sources on sonar processing. This innovative method of optimizing search planning while accounting for active MI will provide the search planning capability required. ORINCON has formed an alignment with Hughes Aircraft for development and transition. An optional capabilitiy is to include planning for ping stealing.",

Identification of IUSS acoustic signals required highly trained specialists to perform in-depth analysis of data having high levels of background noise or clutter. Much of this background includes acoustic emissions from fishing vessels and whale vocalizations. We propose to use data from the IUSS to support government agencies in their drive to prevent illegal fisheries exploitation and whaling activities. The use of IUSS systems and maritime patrol aircraft will enable marine biologists, the Navy, and fishery personnel to monitor whales and fishing/whaling activities in many geographic regions. In Phase I, we will apply ORINCON's experience with IUSS sytems and field-proven coustic surveillance technologies to determine the feasibility of using existing IUSS resources and maritime patrol aircraft to detect, classify, and monitor whale and fishing/whaling vessel activities. Samples of IUSS data have been used by ORINCON and by researchers for the National Marine Mammal Laboratory and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute to study finback (Balanenoptera physalus) and humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) whales.",

        "abstract": "Carbon-Carbon (C-C) composites are candidate materials for hypersonic and aerospace applications due to their high fracture toughness coupled with extremely low density and high temperature strength. However, they easily degrade in an oxidizing environment even at temperatures as low as 450\u00c2\u00bfC. Consequently, the development of high-temperature oxidation-resistant coatings for these materials is of prime importance to the aerospace industry. A major factor that will be instrumental in the exploitation of C-C is the ability to develop oxidation resistant surfaces in order to protect the surface from high altitude or low orbit oxygen available for deterioration of the skin of an avionic or astronautic vehicle travelling at greater than Mach 1. In this Phase I effort, we will demonstrate a novel technique that can achieve oxidation resistant surfaces to 2D carbon-carbon. This process entails the application of tin with the addition of very particular transition metals (in minor but controlled amounts) which as such a mixture can form compounds on the carbon when fired in Co atmospheres and thus result in a direct metallurgical bond to the carbon-carbon workpiece. The tin rich layer can be skimmed off of the resultant metallization layer by reflowing the bulk of the metallization. This can be done while leaving the remaining transition metal rich interfacial zone that can serve as a oxidation resistant layer. We will also perform plating of a thin layer of electrolytic chromium on top of this interfacial reaction zone as a separate experiment. Finally as a control we shall compare these two sets of test specimens to chrome plated but no pretreated carbon-carbon. Coordination has also been initiated with B.F.Goodrich, a major manufacturer of C-C, so that components can be evaluated during the Phase II effort. Direct implementation in production line processes will be feasible in Phase III.",

In response to that need, Osmotek proposes to develop a DOC system that shows exceptional fouling resistance, will have metal-ion rejection, and will have total rejection of soap and oil. The system will have very low energy requirements, low operating costs, simple operation, use very low pressures, and will easily be automated. In Phase I Osmotek will conduct an experimental study of how the membrane casting process affects DOC membrane performance, A long term test will also be conducted to demonstrate the reliability and fouling resistance of the technology. In Phase II a prototype will be designed, build and operated under actual field conditions. Osmotek has pioneered commercial development of DOC technology, holds several patents in the field, and is currently marketing systems in food processing. The proposed research will improve membrane performance in all applications.",

Some preliminary data exists at OBC on a vented version of this system. The potential capability of this system has been demonstrated in this configuration. The Ovonic Nickel metal hydride has been demonstrated to have good energy density, easy manufacturability and environmentally benign disposition. By extrapolation it is expected that the silver metal hydride system proposed will retain all the performance attributes of the nickel metal hydride system. By utilizing some of the key high specific capacity negative electrodes and high energy density silver electrodes it is proposed to fabricate and test prismatic starved cells of capacity greater than 7Ah yielding 80 Wh/kg and over 200/liter in volumetric energy density. They will be tested for capacity, rate capability, temperature performance etc. It is proposed to proceed into Phase II with fabrication and testing of large number of individual prismatic starved cells. Once reproducible results are obtained fabrication and testing of battery modules using these individual cells will be taken up as one of the tasks in Phase II.",

The monohydroxy derivatives oflinoleic acid, 9(S)-HODE and 13 (S)-HODE, are the most widely distributed of the known linoleic acidmetabolites. These compounds exhibit interesting biologic activities, including regulation of plateletfunction, maintenance of vascular thromboresistance and transduction of the cellular responses tocertain growth factors. The HODE derivatives of linoleic acid may also influence certain pathologicalstates including, psoriasis, the development of atherosclerosis and the development of cancer. Indeed,there is a strong positive correlation between the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content of thehuman diet and the incidence of colorectal and breast cancers. Further studies on the physiologic andpathophysiologic roles of HODEs has been slowed by the lack of simple and convenient assays specificfor these compounds. Therefore, the ultimate goal of the present proposal is the development ofsensitive and specific immunoassays for these linoleic acid metabolites.

We will develop molecular probes for a protein thatbinds to the ERBB2 promoter and may regulate ERBB2 gene expression leading to the development andprogression of breast cancer. A DNA binding protein that specifically binds to the promoter region ofthe ERBB2 gene has been detected at high concentrations in samples of adenocarcinoma admixed withcarcinoma of the breast, and is almost undetectable in adjacent benign breast tissue. These preliminaryresults suggest that this protein (hereinafter referred to as the ERBB2 regulatory protein, or \"ERP\"),specifically interacts with the ERBB2 promoter, and may promote transformation of preneoplasticepithelial cells to carcinoma and a metastatic phenotype. Therefore, antibodies and nucleic acid probesspecific for ERP should have widespread applications for staging of human breast biopsy specimens andmay prove useful for determining and monitoring chemotherapeutic treatment protocols.",

        "abstract": "The proposed effort represents some of the most powerful work to be done to develop improved sensing systems for multispectral applications that exhibit a higher level of performance than today's available sensors. This work is worthy of support under the stated criteria for developing new concepts for sensor architecture and pre-processing multispectral sensor information because it is truly innovative. Biological sensors provide technically rich examples for use to use in the developmen tof devices which are more efficient with respect to sensitivity, data throughout and post-detection processing of recovered image data. This project proposes an effort which will accomplish a preliminary design for a sensor which extends the previous work that we have done in the development of the \"neuromorphic\" infrared focal plane device. It will show how this technology may be combined with hyperspectral imaging technology that we have also developed to produce an overall system which performs multispectral image computations directly on-focal plane with a spectral resolution of better than 0.01 um over the desired spectral range. The resulting body of work will provide a solid technical basis for the development of an actual device in a Phase II effort. An extension of the Phase I effort is also proposed in an interim task between Phase I and Phase II that will help further refine design issues in preparation for the hardware development. Devices which mimic biological counterparts are more efficient than conventional sensors in many ways. To a large degree, they process information directly on-plane, reducing the computational load of off-plane processing resources. The ever-increasing pixel count of currently-available devices generates a tremendous quantity of data which ust be handled by off-plane processors. Biological systems do pre-processing of the data to reduce the amount of transmitted data to a level which may be handled by reasonably-sized processors. The data that they deliver has been pre-filtered with respect to spatial and temporal requirements of follow-on devices. They operate to a large extent in the real-time analog domain, so their power dissipati",

        "abstract": "Lasers used as designator and range finders, if detected can give early warning against potential threats. Informaiton about the direction of arrival, spectral content and temporal signature of the laser are needed to countermeasure effectively. Often times the laser radiation is a secondary reflection and not necessarily directed along the optical axis of the laser sensor. For a smart laser sensor to be useful it must have a very low false alarm rate, (FAR), with a high probability of detection, be light weight and integrate easily with existing systems. In essence, an ideal laser warning system should have the following attributes: 1) Low FAR 2) High probability of detection 3) Light weight 4) Low cost 5) Multispectral 6) Large dynamic range (~10 to the 8th power) 7) Through put sensitivty 8) CW and single pulse detection (10 nsec pulse width) 9) Detect scattered and direct laser signals A system designed to detect pulsed lasers may not be effective in detecting CW lasers if such a system is looking for the fast rise time and large peak power of the pulsed laser signal and does not have the sensitivity to detect the lower power of the CW laser. As will be described later in this proposal the PAT approach to laser warning can be used for both CW and pulsed lasers. Also the PAT approach to laser warning can tell the difference between direct and indirect laser signals, i.e., laser signals that enter the sensor directly verses scattered radiation will give different signal characteristics.",

Pacific-Sierra Research Corporation has developed Chemical Weapons and Nuclear Capabilities Acquisition Process models (CWCAP and NCAP, respectively) for estimating the status of indigenous production and deployment of WMD. The purpose of this Phase I effort is to develop a proof-of-concept model of the import process supporting WMD procurement. While our proposed Proliferation Import Model (PIM) could ultimately (perhaps in Phase II) be integrated with CWCAP and NCAP for a comprehensive analysis of WMD procurement, it would have considerable value as a stand-alone tool as well. PIM features flexible graphical displays of the import networks used by WMD developers to obtain critical commodities for their programs. Data is entered for each supplier, route, transshipment point, entry port, etc., represented as nodes and arcs in the PIM graph. Nodes and arcs may then be \"filtered\" so that, for example, all import routes evidently in use and susceptible to interdiction may be highlighted. PIM would also provide a flexible and intuitive means to evaluate options regarding the monitoring, suppression, and interdiction of WMD importation. Anticipated Benefits: In addition to its primary benefit of providing proliferation analysts with a fast, flexible, and intuitive tool for entering intelligence data and tracking the WMD import process, the PIM methodology could be used by government organizations responsible for monitoring narcotics trafficking and by private companies seeking a means to gauge competition in new technologies by tracking the purchases of their competitors.",

Our goal is to provide more accurate location and better sensitivity than is now available.

A compact, low-noise sensor and analysis system is proposed that provides continuous, near real-time storm locations. This system will contain event detection algorithms that replace the present method of detecting events by visual inspection or hardcopied data. These new detection algorithms are essential for an autonomous system. The effectiveness of the hardware design and improved flash detection and location algorithms will be evaluated in terms of two criteria: (1) minimum flash intensity required for detection and location (hence, minimum storm size) and (2) error in flash location. The evaluation will include the use and placement of a global network of stations. In addition to the primary application of monitoring storms, the new system has application to environmental monitoring and global warming.",

Pacific-Sierra Research Corporation (PSR) is currently evaluating five candidate dichroic beamsplitter elements in a related HWIL Dichroic Target Screen project. One design concept uses a small dichroic screen in an agile mode to translate and tilt the IR wavefront prior to combining it with the RF wavefront. This low risk development approach has the disadvantage of only being able to simulate the dynamic image overthe relatively narrow field of view (NFOV) allowed by the width of the dichroic element. A large field of regard is obtained by translation of the dichroic element. A second design approach uses a relatively large, stationary dichroic screen to reflect the project IR wavefront to the missile sensor under test. This development approach has the advantage of being able to simulate the dynamic image over the relatively wide field of view (WFOV) allowed by the width of the dichroic screen. This approach will allow rapid IR target motion to be simulated by rapidly moving the projected IR image across the dichroic screen. This more involved development approach requires the development of a larger dichroic screen.",

The IFF system proposed can be interrogated by laser pulses or by a covert (spread spectrum) RF \"request to transpond\".

Meanwhile, the message is valiadated and answered with a message containing extensive information about the Victim, such as time, vehicle number and location.

Although its active ingredients have a long historyof use as therapeutic agents for a variety of maladies, its psychoactive actions limit its current use inWestern medicine. There is also evidence that immunosuppression results from chronic marijuana use.The central cannabinoid receptor from brain, and more recently, the peripheral cannabinoid receptor froma promyelocytic leukemic cell line, have been cloned. In Phase I stable cell lines expressing either thebrain or the peripheral receptor subtype will be established and will be used to develop a high throughputscreening program to screen for potent and selective agonists and antagonists. Macrophage cell linesand cell lines expressing either receptor subtype will also be used to study the signaling pathwaysemployed by the two receptors. The goal is to identify new therapeutic agents that would have thedesirable immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects mediated by the peripheral cannabinoidreceptor, but devoid of central psychoactive effects.",

Avaluable addition to this methodology would be to link receptor-ligand binding in a manner similar toclonal proliferation of lymphoid cells during an immune response. Recent studies indicate that it is indeedpossible to link phage display of binding proteins directly to phage replication by genetically fusing theprotein or antigen of interest to capsid protein gene3. Because this approach is unwieldy andinconvenient for most purposes, we will develop a general method to link phage displayed antibodies tophage replication. We will create a chimeric fusion protein linking streptavidin to the terminal 100 aminoacids of the m13 gene3 protein. Next, a test antigen turkey lysozyme will be biotinylated and finally wewill test the capacity of this biotinylated antigen to rescue phage displaying an anti-turkey lysozymescFv.

        "abstract": "Currently there are a variety of in vitro screening assays used to test environmental compoundsand potential drugs for mutagenic and carcinogenic activity. However, these assays generally do notdetect tumor promoters, thus economical screens for these agents are urgently needed. This applicationwill develop and test a novel, inexpensive in vitro screening assay to test large numbers of environmentalcompounds and drugs for tumor promoting activity. This assay is based on the new finding that manyor all tumor promoters can inhibit or induce cellular resistance to the physiological process of cell deaththrough apoptosis. The assay, termed, ApoScreen, will be validated by testing a panel of knownpromoters and non-promoting agents to determine if their effects on apoptosis correlate with previouslypublished results in animal models of tumor promotion. The human U937 tumor cell line will be treatedwith each test agent using a high dose acute exposure or a low physiological dose chronic exposureprotocol. Apoptosis in response to tumor necrosis factor or UV light will be assessed by measuring DNAfragmentation in an assay requiring only 2-3 hr. incubation. If ApoScreen shows good predictive ability,it will ultimately be used in conjunction with other surrogate assays to screen large numbers ofcompounds for those exhibiting tumor promoter characteristics. The most suspicious compounds canthen be tested in the more expensive and time consuming animal models of tumor promotion. Thisapproach should provide an efficient and economical mechanism to identify potentially dangerouscompounds and reduce human exposure to tumor promoting agents.",

Whileanti-erbB-2 antibodies and immunoconjugates show much promise for breast cancer therapy, a fullyhuman high-affinity anti-erbB2 antibody is currently not available. Phage display libraries of antibodyvariable region repertoires have opened a novel route for the isolation of recombinant human monoclonalantibodies. What is lacking is a reliable means for completing the affinity maturation process in vitro.To accomplish, this we have developed a computer-assisted method, called Parsimonious Mutagenesis(PM), for scanning antibody CDR for mutations which improve affinity (Balint and Larrick, 1993). Thismethod facilitates the construction of \"scanning\" libraries which can \"probe\" the surface of an antigena few residues at a time with a wide selection of preselected amino acid side chains to search out andidentify new high-affinity contacts. These libraries are made with special low-redundancy \"doping\"codons and nucleotide mixtures designed to maximize the abundance of combining sites withpredetermined proportions of altered sites.

This superior performance of DU-based alloys is due to its ability to adiabatically shear during penetration events and, thereby, continually self-sharpen itself. It is desirable to impart this property in tungsten-based composites. Unfortunately, tungsten is not amenable to adiabatic shear band formation. Thus, even if the matrix material in tungsten heavy alloys are susceptible to adiabatic shear localization, the bands are usually unable to propagate and provide the desired penetration properites. It is conveived that if a monolithic, adiabatic shear prone alloy can be concentrated in specific areas of the penetrator rod, its effectiveness can be significantly increased. The key challenges during Phase I will be economically provide a thick coating (of an adiabatic shear prone alloy) on the tungsten alloy substrate which is very adherent, dense, and which does not form embrittling phases at the interface. One of the successful coating material will be used for coating a specially designed tungsten rod which incorporates a reduction in its diameter over half its length.",

Despite these benefits, closed-cycle J-T cryocoolers are not often used for sensor cooling applications due to the lack of a suitable compressor. We propose the development of a J-T cryocooler based upon a small ultra-clean compressor system which handles multiple gases and multiple compression stages in a single compact, sealed unit. An innovative drive system gives the system high power density and low vibration.",

        "abstract": "Wet etching for oxide thin films is superior to dry processes because it has extremely low contamination, eliminates water markes from the wafers, provides a high degree of process flexibility and control, has better cleanliness, and the equipment is compact. However, wet etching has had limited application because the etch uniformity is difficult to control. We propose to develop an innovative mixer which operates inside a wet etching chamber to provide extremely uniform conditions to all wafers to produce very uniform etch results. The innovation is the use of non-contacting, hydrodynamic bearings to support the mixing impeller without any solid-to-solid contact between the impeller and the chamber walls, so that no particulate contamination is generated. In Phase I we will perform flow tests to measure loads on the impeller shaft during operation and to show that the mixing impeller provides uniform conditions in the etching chamber. A prototypical hydrodynamic bearing will be fabricated and tested for load bearing capacity. In Phase II we will design and build the drive system for the mixer and test it in actual wafer etching chambers and evaluate its effectiveness by measuring the uniformity of etched silicon wafers. Anticipated Benefits: The proposed wet etching process will have extremely low contamination and excellent control of etch uniformity. The mixing unit will be inexpensive and reliable because there are no contacting, moving parts. The primary application is etching of thin film, mutli-component oxides used in electronics, photonics, sensors, and micro-electro mechanical systems.",

Their multiphase models are inaccurate, outmoded, or poorly implemented. They are difficult to use without extensive training, and computation times are measured in days. We propose to develop an innovative computer code incorporating both modern, userfriendly interfaces and fundamental mechanistic models for two- phase flow and heat transfer in microgravity. Using state-of-the- art concepts in multiphase modelling and in software design, our objective is to provide a design tool (computer code) that is compact, fast, and portable, easily used by experimentalists and designers for transient or steady-state calculations. In Phase I, a subset of the complete code will be developed and tested for a condensing radiator model and will also be used to compare with NASA LeRC flight test data. The final design tool will be the only existing transient code for spacecraft thermal management systems which can, by its basic structure, correctly include the twofluid models for two-phase flow in microgravity from ongoing research at NASA LeRC. Expected NASA applications include design of two-phase systems and supporting experiments, and the benefits are greatly reduced training and computational time for the users.",

        "abstract": "Our goal is a major advancement in the life cycle of rechargeable, solid-state lithium/polymer batteries -- a factor of ten improvement to 1000's of recharge cycles. We will achieve this goal by attacking various problems of degradation at the electrode/ electrolyte interfaces, a primary factor in limiting rechargeable life and broader commercial value of these batteries. Identification and understanding of the various degradation mechanisms will lead to improved fabrication processes to mitigate degradation. In Phase I, we propose to identify and model the passivation mechanisms at the anode/electrolyte interface and modify fabrication processes to mitigate passivation. Our Phase I effort uniquely synthesizes interfacial impedance modeling, supplementary physical (XPS) analysis, and mechanistic modeling with advanced battery technology and manufacturing processes developed by our teammate, Alliant Techsystems. During Phase II, we will apply the Phase I methods to the cathode interfaces and fabrication processes. Results of this proejct are batteries with greatly improved life cycle, and possibly related products such as a smart recharger or diagnostic software. We expect to license Phase III products or processes to Alliant Techsystems. Anticipated Benefits: With specific energy ratings 2 to 5 times greater than present batteries, rechargeable lithium/polymer-electrolyte batteries are an attractive candidate for portable applications. There is a large commercial market for high energy density, long life batteries for medical implant devices, portable communicaion, global positioning, laptop computer, and electric vehicle applications. Military applications include seconday batteries on sattelites and backpacks where the benefits are reduced cost through smaller size and extended recycle life.",

        "abstract": "In this program Creare will develop test data and design methods for confident design of efficient cooling systems for turbine disks in aircraft gas turbine engines. Cooling systems must prevent ingress of hot combustion gases into the cavity between the turbine disk and its stator when there is an intense, swirling flow past the turbine disk from the turbine nozzles. In previous tests at Creare, this swirling flow has been found to increase the cooling flow requirements. We propose to develop a body of test data applying to basic disk/stator configurations, simple theory to assess the effects of design changes, and qualified computational models for detailed assessment of designs. Innovations are: (1) a small, low-speed test facility in which water is used to simulate, observe, and measure the flow in the disk/stator gap of a gas turbine, and (2) original mechanistic design models based on analysis of the forces which govern the flow in the gap. In Phase I we will prove the feasibility of our approach by developing a basic theory for the effects of external flow on the required cooling flow and showing that theoretical predictions agree with Creare's existing database of test results. In Phase II we will perform detailed tests using flow models which simulate aircraft engines and develop qualified theory and computational models for cooling system design.",

The proposed project will develop a system for providing health care providers with accurate and timely pre-admission verification of insurance eligibility and coverage, thereby significantly reducing these costs. The system architecture draws on software previously developed under DOD sponsorship for real time management of data in a distributed concurrent engineering environment. The implementation will be modular, esily capable of handling diverse data standards and communication protocols, scaleable, and cost effective for both the provider and the participating insurers. The proposed design addresses authentication and patient confidentiality issues and adheres to open standards for user interfacing and networking. Feasibility will be demonstrated in Phase I with prototype software tested in conjunction with a major primary care research and teaching hospital. A fully functional system, suitable for direct commercialization, will be developed and demonstrated in the user environment in Phase II. Anticipated Benefits: The proposed software will provide direct and immediate savings to health care providers by reducing errors and omissions in claim preparation and increasing their cost reimbursement rate. In addition, it provides a mechanism for insurers (including federal, state, and local government) to easily and cost-effectively make patient insurance coverage information available to providers, while retaining access control to their data.",

Light weight and compact size elements offer particularly important benefits for many commercial and government applications. However, at present the fabrication of elements with both high resolution and high diffraction efficiency is a difficult, expensive process reuqiring skilled labor and costly capital equipment. Foster-Miller proposes to demonstrate in Phase I of this program, a major advance in the manufacturing of diffractive elements by direct laser writing of high efficiency multilevel elements in a sub-micron resolution holographic film. Inexpensive, high quality elements cna then be subsequently mass produced by a replication process that has already been demonstrated in commercial use. In addition, the unique structure of this holographic film allows the creation of liquid crystal composites that can be electrically controlled, allowing the development for the first time of tunable diffractive optical elements. This novel films has been jointly demosntrated in a number of advanced optical applications, including beam division, switching, lensing and optical filtering, by Foster-Miller and Polaroid Corp., and has widespread commercial potential for diffractive optics. Anticipated Benefits: Diffractive optical elements have vast potential commerical applications in optical imaging, laser beam control and shaping, and optical interconnects for electronic processors, optical memories and optical processing, if the manufacturing costs can be lowered significantly. The small size and weight are important for aricraft and consumer items such as cameras. Compact tunable elements will be used in planar optics and for accessing 2D and 3D optical storage. The growing nation-wide high speed fiber communications network will increase demand for active connection devices based on diffractive elements.",

Compared to fully active systems, the adaptive-passive system consumes less power, is more reliable and is less costly. The feasibility is determined through two parallel efforts: An analytic study and the construction and testing of a prototype device. The analytic study compares the adaptive-passive approach to both passive systems and fully active systems. The devices are compared on the basis of acoustic/vibration performance, reliability, cost and power consumption. Also included in the analytic study is the development of simple, effective feedback control strategies for resonant tuning of the adaptive passive device. The feedback control and acoustic/vibration performance is verified through experimental testing of the prototype device.",

This proposal addresses the mine neutralization aspect of the problem. PDA has been developing high speed underwater rockets and projectiles for the past six years for the Navy, primarily under the sponsorship of the Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC). The performance of both rocket propelled and gun launched missiles has been domonstrated in tests. PDA is currently under contract to NUWC to demonstrate a gun launched projectile for submarine self defense against torpedoes and mine. PDA is also working with Hughes Aircraft Company to develop an air- and water-going version for neutralization of moored and bottom mines from helicopter platforms. This anti-mine munition (AMM) would also be used as part of a surface ship torpedo defense system. A variant of projectile designs currently under development is proposed for the required mine neutralization device. Primary differences are the need for a small light disposable launch tube and a time delay firing mechanism. Projectile design is simplified by the very short effective range desired.",

The standard criterion measure for measuring knowledge/skill retention and decay is a Job Knowledge Test (JKT). Therefore we will develop a multiple-choice JKT using expert aassistance from AP training staff. The JKT will measure the foundation of AP knowledge and skills, i.e., factual information. We also propose to develop a criterion measure that assesses application of AP knowledge and skills in realistic situations encountered on the job. PDRI researchers have pioneered innovative, cost-effective methods for developing and administering such situational tests. The situational test will present respondents with a series of job-relevant situations and ask them to indciate wich of several alternative actions would be most effective and which would be least effective in each situation. We will capitalize on the expertise of AP training staff and aircrew members to develop realistic situations and response alternatives. The situational test can be administered to large groups using a paper-and-pencil format. Thus it is very cost-effective to administer, yet provides a realistic work simulation criterion measure.",

A hydroxyapatite fiber would find many uses in bone replacement applications; especially bonereplacements requiring high strength and toughness in a completely biocompatible material. Fabrics ofwoven hydroxyapatite fiber could be used as scaffolds for bone ingrowth. Composites reinforced withthe hydroxyapatite fiber could replace bone in highly loaded areas and would also be useful inreplacement of thin sections where a high degree of toughness would be required. Existing fiberhandling and textile technologies would be useful to form the hydroxyapatite fiber into shapes simulatingthe replaced bone. Mechanical properties of hydroxyapatite implants would be tailored to mimick theanisotropic properties of bone so that input stresses to living host bone would be as natural as possible.It is anticipated that any wear products of hydroxyapatite composites would not cause adverse tissuereactions as is sometimes the case with biomaterials currently in use. The laboratory process to makethe fiber is based on the sol-gel technique which has been successful in making several commerciallyviable products in recent years. Small scale trials will be performed and the composition and tensilestrength of the fiber will be measured. With these results a continuous process will be designed and itsfeasibility tested.

        "abstract": "Loss of p53 tumor suppressor gene function occurs in a majority of human cancers. Inactivationof p53 may be a crucial step in tumor development. Certain tumors and tumor cell lines contain anamplified MDM2 gene. MDM2 protein binds p53 protein in vitro and in vivo and can block thetransactivation and growth suppressive functions of p53. Therefore, in tumors overexpressing MDM2,p53 activity presumably is lost by interaction with MDM2. Since wild-type p53 often is found in tumorsor cell lines overexpressing MDM2, treatment of these tumors with an agent that disrupts thep53-MDM2 complex could restore normal levels of functional p53, leading to the inhibition of tumorgrowth. A domain of MDM2 that interacts with p53 has been identified and preliminary results indicatethat this isolated domain binds both RNA and DNA random sequence oligonucleotides. The research isto use a random oligonucleotide selection strategy to identify specific RNA and DNA sequences or motifsthat will bind MDM2 protein and block its interaction with p53 protein. Selected sequences will beanalyzed to determine an appropriate sequence with minimal size for full activity. Ultimately, theseoligonucleotides will be chemically modified to develop pharmacologically-suitable drug candidates.",

        "abstract": "Supercritical fluid technology is proposed as a solventless technique for photoresist developing, a crucial step in semiconductor manufacturing. The concept exploits the pressure dependent solubility characteristics of dense gases, specifically carbon dioxide, for selectively dissolving the soluble portions of the exposed resist. Preliminary testing was conducted to demonstrate proof-of-concept; the results were remarkably successful and are described in this proposal. It is the objective of this effort to develop a dry process for use with at least one specific photoresist and to demonstrate that the process is applicable to both positive and negative bilayer and single layer resist systems. IBM Almaden Research Center will under subcontract provide the analytical, technical, and business expertise relating to photoresist chemistry and, generally, to integrated circuit manufacturing operations. In addition, through their relationship with MIT Lincoln Laboratory, IBM will have access to state of the art etching equipment. The advantages of utilizing supercritical carbon dioxide instead of solvents will have important ramifications on environmental issues, especially in minimizing waste generation and disposal. Furthermore, the technology offers the potential for processing several high performance resist systems that have been abandoned due to problems associated with conventional liquid organic solvent developers. Anticipated Benefits: Aside from the environmental advantages over solvent processes, supercritical carbon dioxide developing of photoresists will significantly broaden the range of usefulness of existing resist systems and promises the potential for bringing to the market a host of chemically modified high performance resists systems which are not currently available. It is anticipated that as restrictions on solvent use become more stringent, this technology will proliferate into diverse areas of industry.",

Extended tasks propose to accelerate the overall application of SCFE to decontamination, viz., to combine the evaluation effort to provide process, engineering, and cost information for an actual decontamination system. It is proposed to extend the Phase I effort with an optional task during which actual small intricate equipment will be processed in a larger system. Background information on similar chemical and biological systems, the extended and accelerated schedule of events and milestones, will ensure that SCFE can be evaluated fully in a technical and economic comparison with other processes.

The droplet generator will have multiple interchangeable nozzles with a range of exit aperture diameters and the capability to select the number of active nozzles for each experiment.

The specific innovation is that the entire interferometer assembly (beamsplitter, mirrors, lens, and associated optics) will be fabricated as a monolithic, solid block. The importance of this innovation is that very compact instruments can be built for field and flight assignments that will require no adjustments beyond initial assembly since they cannot become misaligned. In addition, the dispersion effects of thick beamsplitters will be eliminated, thus restoring the large field of view inherent to the common-path interferometer. The instrument has an inherently wide range of design flexibility. We anticipate that it can be used for spectrophotometry, spatially resolved spectroscopy, and moderate resolution spectroscopy over a wide spectral range. The large field of view with respect to grating spectrometers will make this an invaluable instrument for many applications.",

In the proposed Phase I, PRA will explore several related methods for providing this capability. Specifically, track-estimation algorithms operating on the line-of-sight direction from an aircraft-mounted sensor to the missile will be designed and tested using a flight simulation code such as DISAMS, ESAMS or ALIA. Evaluation criteria will include the time elapsed between loss of missile lock (LOL) and the detection of same by the algorithm, and the rate of false LOL indications.

        "abstract": "The next generation of high-speed (> 25 GHz) optical links require new designs for semiconductor laser. Photonics Research Incorporated (PRI) proposes to design, fabricate and test a new breed of laser diode which inherently operates at higher speeds, lower thresholds, and wider temperature range. This new type of laser, called the vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL), can be fabricated in arbitrary, one- and two-dimensional arrays (tradenamed LASE-ARRAY by PRI), thus, providing laser source arrays which integrate simply and efficiently to optical fiber ribbons or micro-optic arrays. Fundamentally, there are three things which will increase the bandwidth of a semiconductor laser: (1) increase the photon density; (2) increase the optical gain amplitude; or (3) decrease the photon lifetime. VCSEL cavities have very high finesse (R1, R2 > 0.995) but are very short (L=1). Consequently, the photon density can be > 100 times higher than in edge-emitters while the photon lifetime remains constant. To further increase the bandwidth of VCSELs, PRI will employ strained quantum-well (QW) active regions such as InGaAs on GaAs to increase the optical gain amplitude, increase the thermal stability, and decrease the laser threshold. PRI will explore the effects of p-type modulation-doping (in the QW barriers) on increasing gain and photon density. Finally, PRI will implement its low-resistance VCSEL design to minimize parasitics.",

The complications inherent in 3-D PBG structures can be avoided by creating two-dimensional cavities in the waveguide plane. Etching, structuring, and mask-patterning techniques are currently used to create such structures. Thus, the development of PBGs at optical wavelengths is expected in the near future. Using the waveguide PBG structure to develop a channel waveguide with low loss is an obvious application. Ultra-low bending loss for sharply bent channel waveguides can be obtained and will have significant impact on waveguide-based, optical-interconnect data buses for high-speed electronic systems. The waveguide PBG can preserve the performance of existing waveguide devices (modulators, switches, polarization control devices, and coherent couplers). It can also improve existing devices by reducing loss, increasing the branching angle, and increasing grating reflectivity in waveguide spectrometers.",

        "abstract": "To meet the requirements of a large sensor network for aircraft structure monitoring, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes a novel active multiplexed fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor network for strain, temperature, and vibration monitoring. The active sensor addressing uses a super flourescence regenerator whose modulation period matches the round trip time of the addressed sensor's optical loop. Thus, the light energy is always concentrated on the addressed sensor. The sensor network energy efficiency is 10(4) to 10(5) times higher than that of conventional passive multiplexing techinques, resulting in a very high signal to noise ratio and low power consumption. Only such active addressing technique can make it possible to incorporate a large number of sensors in a network, while maintaining extremely low cross talk and high dynamic range. Using the proposed multiplexed FBG sensor network, combined with neural network data analysis techniques, the status of the aircraft structure can be reliably and promptly reported. The major effort in Phase I will be to demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of the active multiplexing technique, the key technique in the network. Anticipated Benefits: The proposed sensor network can find application in the aerospace industry, in monitoring of civil buildings, dams, electrical generators, gas or oil pipes, and high speed trains. The potential commercial market for the proposed sensor network is very large.",

Immunoassays offer the potential of highly specific screening for diverse organic and inorganic analytes. In order to rapidly screen for diverse biological agents in the field, a rugged, field-portable luminometer is needed. Commercially available fluorimeters and luminometers are bulky and best suited for clinical and laboratory envioronments, rather than harsh military environment. To aid the Army in assessing the potential of bio/chemiluminescent immunoassays for bioagent detection, Physical Optics Corporation proposes to develop a novel, field-portable, multi-analyte luminometer using charge-coupled device (CCD) intensification techniques developed for the Hubble Space Telescope program. The high sensitivity, large dynamic range, small size, and lower power requirements of the proposed CCD detector promise a compace, field-portable luminometer capable of detecting a broad variety of flow, flash, and enhanced flash reactions associated with target biological agents.

No technique is currently available for atmospheric or oceanographic measurements of irradiance spatial density. Physical Optics Corporation proposes a novel 3-D spatial filtering technique which will enable a conventional imaging system to reject all the light from out-of-focus planes. The key component is a novel pixel filter (or a pixel filter array) placed at the image focal plane. The pixel filter contains a wavefront-matched filter, a microlens, and an optical fiber. It allows only the light from the in-focus region to pass. Thus the system can be used for remote 4-D measurement of irradiance spatial density without the contamination of strong background and stray light. If equipped with a pixel filter array, the system can be used for sectioning imaging of three dimensional objects without any scanning. The Phase I research effort will result in an experimental demonstration of a proof-of-concept of the pixel filter and a numerical evaluation of the performance of the pixel filter. In Phase II, a prototype instrument for the measurement of irradiance spatial density using the 3-D spatial filtering technique will be developed.",

This new tunable filter is based on the unique concept of spectrum division by spatial filtering (SDSF). This concept can be readily implemented in a minaturized form without any moving parts by integrating four of POC's well developed technologies; fiber optics, planar waveguides, planar (volume holographic) diffractive optics, and spatial light modulators (SLM). The filter module will be highly stable (thermal and long-term), rugged, and compact (low profile printed circuit board mountable). Innovations of our proposed approach include: (1) spectrographic optics are miniaturized and confined to 2D, using waveguide geometry, which is highly compatible with fiber optic systems. Spatial filtering by an SLM array eliminates all mechanical movements in the tuning process; (2) a single, very broad band, multiplexed volume holographic grating provides very wide band tunability with uniformly high efficiency; (3) parallel addressable 1D reflective SLM arrays allow recombination of the filtered spectrum back through the same set of planar optics and into the output fiber; a very efficient process.",

POC's modulator does not suffer from the shortcomings of state-of-the-art modulators such as nonlinearity, intermodulation products, harmonic distortion, or frequency chirping. Two preferred modulator configurations are proposed, and are considered to be ideally suited for dual use applications. These are: a plasmon EO modulator and a waveguide EO modulator. In the plasmon modulator, the EO polymer is external with respect to the channel waveguide, while in the waveguide modulator, the waveguide is made up of the EO polymer itself.

Phase II will also include ehancing the performance characteristics of both modulators, and cost effectively expanding the application base beyond the U.S. market.

The basic idea is the Fourier synthesis of the lithographic pattern through sequential recording of sinusoidal harmonics. Fourier synthesis does not increase the total exposure time. Potential benefits of our innovative approach include: no-mask lithography (fabrication immediately follows design, using CAD-generated layout); greatly increased throughout when compared to stepper machines (a large area is exposed at once); no diffraction blurring as in proximity printing; extremely high effective numerical aperture; spatial resolution smaller than a wavelength (the smallest grating period that can be recorded is unattainable with conventional optics); very small number of moderate-quality optical components required; the depth of focus significantly increased compared to conventional systems; easy alignment. POC realizes that the proposed approach differs significantly from the current technological thrust. However, in order to dramatically improve our nation's competitiveness in large panel display manufacturing, a non-incremental approach is called for. This fits the Defense Policy Objectives for National Technology Base in \"ensuring technological superiority over potential adversaries\" (10 USC 2501 (a)(3)).

        "abstract": "Advanced sensors that can withstand the extreme temperatures and vibrations of an operating engine environment are required in order to improve the performance and efficiency of these engines. Present temperature sensor technology requires sensors to protrude into the hot gas stream or be embedded in the component being monitored. These sensors not only interfere with the operation of the engine, but they are quite often temperature limited, short lived, and /or inaccurate. Physical Optics Corporation proposes the use of a narrow field-of-view IR radiation temperature sensor that utilizes recently developed sapphire optical fiber technology and an innovative sapphire non-imaging optical (NIO) element. The sapphire fiber will be drawn to make the NIO a natural extension of the fiber end. Therefore, only a one-piece sapphire probe needs to be exposed to the hot environment of the engine. The sapphire probe can be installed flush with the engine wall, without intruding into the hot gas stream, to monitor the temperature of hot gases or internal engine components. Sapphire's melting point is - 2000\"C, far exceeding any temperature limit of internal combustion engines. An IR transmitting fiber will carry the IR radiation to a spectrum analyzer for temperature determination. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - Non-intrusive temperature sensors for monitoring high temperatures can find military and commercial applications. Military applications include test-bed engine monitoring and temperature measurement of metal matrix composite coupons during thermal fatigue cycling. Commercial uses include monitoring combustion process temperatures (automobiles, boilers, etc.) to improve combustion efficiency and decrease pollution emission.",

The cost of these carbon-carbon components are generally high due to the long process times required to achieve fully densified parts. Current densification practices using carbon vapor deposition, low pressure impregnation and carbonization, or high pressure impregnation and carbonization generally require from 12 to 18 weeks to achieve full density. A novel approach is proposed to significantly reduce the number of process cycles needed to achieve full densification. The new process uses a modified high char yielding pitch precursor together with a newly demonstrated sensor controlled carbonization process to potentially reduce the densification time from 12 weeks to 4 weeks. In addition, the proposed process can be used with the simpler low pressure impregnation and carbonization precedure for added cost savings.",

This neutral-beam approach, based upon our fast atom sample tester (FAST) technology, does not produce high-energy ions; thus, it avoids the bombardment damage and the chemical complexity of plasma-assisted dry etching. The FAST apparatus will be reconfigured to yield an intermediate-energy high-flux fluorine atom beam; specifically, 1 to 10 eV, 10-16 to 10-17 atoms/cm-2-s. The beam will be diagnosed, process parameters will be determined, and operational maps will be constructed. Hyper-thinning of silicon substrates will be demonstrated, and the absence of both damage and surfgace residues will be verified. In collaboration with the Semiconductor Division of M/A COM, the fluorine FAST process will be assessed for production use. One or more device lines will be selected as the Phase II test-bed. The process flow charts will be modified to accommodate fluorine atom beam thinning, and changes in product yield will be estimated. The technical benefits and market advantages of the hyper-thin components in the proposed baseline technology will be projected. Finally, a business plan will be written, in order to evaluate the acquisition of the fluorine FAST process by M/A COM.",

The objective of the program is to experimentally demonstrate the new method and establish scaling to commercially interesting powers. The project consists of modifying apparatus supplied by PSI for plasma spraying, then measuring the output flow temperature and velocities and testing the ability to spray materials. Microwave driven plasma spraying offers several advantages over conventional arc-driven plasma sprayers. Microwave discharges require no electrodes, thus eliminating the problems of wear associated with these elements. The discharges are also more stable, potentially improving the quality of the sprayed coating and reducing operating noise. In addition, a variety of gases, including inexpensive nitrogen, can be used as the working fluid. Ohmic and thermal losses are low, resulting in potentially high efficiencies. The discharge can operate at higher pressures at high temperatures, resulting in the high velocities of HVOF but at the high temperatures of plasma devices. This results in higher quality coatings of high melting temperature materials, such as ceramics. This capability offers significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art plasma spray technology.",

RESEARCHERS HAVE DEMONSTRATED EFFICIENT, HIGH RATE DIAMOND ETCHING WITH A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE OF SURFACE FINISHING.  EXISTING POLISHING TECHNIQUES SUFFER FROM ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING DEFICIENCIES: SLOW POLISHING RATE, SMALL POLISHING AREAS, HIGH SUBSTRATE TEMPERATURES DURING POLISHING, THE NEED TO AGGRESSIVELY HANDLE THE DIAMOND FILM OR SUBSTRATE, AND THE POTENTIAL FOR DEFECT AND IMPURITY INCORPORATION INTO THE DIAMOND FILM RESULTING FROM INTERACTION WITH ENERGETIC IONS.

        "abstract": "PSI proposed to develop a novel method for making large high temperature superconducting magnetic shields. There are many existing applications that need the high level of electro-magnetic isolation that is obtained with superconducting magnetic shields. For example, atomic frequency standards, biomagnetic measurement systems, and SQUID based devices could benefit from the availability of large, low cost superconducting magnetic shields. Low temperature superconducting magnetic shields, which operate at liquid helium temperatures (4.2), offer extremely high levels of shielding, but require expensive cryogenic systems to maintain teh required operating temperatures. High temperature superconducting (HTS) shields, which can operate at liquid nitrogen temperatures (77 K), require relatively simple and inexpensive cryogenic systems and the shielding level obtained with HTS shields is greater than can be obtained with pre-existing 77 K shielding technology. However, with current state-of-the-art techniques, HTS magnetic shields are difficult to construct in sizes large enough for many applications. PSI has developed an innovative process by which small HTS magnetic shields have been easily construction and tested. We propose to extend and optimize this process for the construction of large magnetic shielding structures. In the process we form multi-layer ceramic metal laminates; usually a metal-HTS-metal sandwich. These composite sheets are formed into magnetic shields by deep drawing. The shields created by this process can be easily manufactured, handled and incoporated into cryostats. Anticipated Benefits: Magnetic shields made by the proposed technique will find application in devices where high levels of magnetic shielding are critical, such as frequency standards and devices that use HTS SQUIDS. The proposed process is well suited for large scale manufacturing.",

Innovative cell culture growth establishment andmaintenance, product formation and monitoring, and germplasm screening strategies will be developedin a comprehensive and integrated manner. The specific aim of Phase I research is to establish thefeasibility using plant cell cultures for Michellamine B production by accomplishing five enablingobjectives: 1) develop network for germplasm collection; 2) establish callus cultures and developmaintenance techniques; 3) refine analytical methods for the detection and quantitation of MichellamineB; 4) establish cell suspensions from callus cell lines and develop preliminary conditions favoring growthand product formation; and 5) Screen cell lines from an available germplasm pool and identify a few elitelines capable of producing Michellamine B. Technologically innovative components include i) the use ofplant cell cultures for production of pharmaceuticals, ii) the use of comprehensive optimization ofvariables for establishment and enhancement of callus and cell suspension growth, and iii) the use ofnovel rapid-screening methods for identifying productive cell lines.

        "abstract": "We are proposing a fundamental leap forwards in both technique and performance of measurement techniques for characterizing ultrahigh-speed electronic signals. We will design and build a laser-based oscilloscope for characterizing electrical signals in the picosecond time regime. The oscilloscope will be based on the use of non-stoichiometrically grown InGaAs:As photoconductive detector elements that will function as ultrahigh-speed sampling gates when illuminated by infrared picosecond laser pulses. These detectors are the fastest in the world and represent the critical link that enables optical pulses to effictively be used to meaurte electrical signals. Our goals for this system are to obtain a temporal resolution of less than 5 picoseconds and a sensitivity of less than 100uV/Hz. Picosecond lasers have now become standard, off-the-shelf items. The use of infrared pulses is desirable because they can be generated by compact fiber pumed by highly efficient diode lasers. This combination of technologies will enable the development of a compact instrumentation system that will allow users to characterize picosecond electrical signals with unprecedented temporal resolution and accuracy. These laser-based sampling oscilloscopes will usher in a new era of jitter-free picosecond instrumentation that makes working in the picosecond regime natural.",

To correctly interpret the space environment, the resulting modes of impact damage, and the potential methods that may be employable to mitigate the effects, generic analytic scaling laws that can adequately describe the impact effects must be used. However, none of the current empirical scaling laws can address all the necessary impact conditons (variations in materials, shape, mass, and velocity) in a physically consistent fashion. This proposal addresses the need for a high fidelity, physics-based model for first-order predictions of meteoroid and debris impact damage and its associated effects on satellite system survivability, reliability and performance. This effort will develop a physically consistent, unified impact damage model (SUPerCID) for predicting perforation and cratering impact damage for use in analyses of the reliability, survivability and probablistic risk of proposed commercial and government spacecraft designs and operations.",

Its key feature is the use of an unique membrane-driven compressor that has no life-limiting moving parts such as those present in conventional piston-driven compressors. The use of a powder-membrane in the compressor eliminates the clearance seals, moving pistons, shafts and piston-supports (such as flexures) that havde consistently been major sources of poor and degraded performance in conventional cryocoolers. The powder-membrane will be vibrated by a unique linear vibrating motor to create a lens-shaped working volume. This working volume generates a pressure waveform which is used to oscillate the displacer and hence produce cold. In Phase I we propose to develop design programs for these key components and use them to fabricate a bread-board model of the membrane-driven compressor. This compressor will be tested for reliability and consistency to establish the practical merit of this concept.",

        "abstract": "Compressed Natural Gas is the leading alternative automative fuel candidate. However, current cylinders used for on-board CNG storage are expensive, overweight, and have limited capacity. The Flex Tube program develops technology that significantly reduces CNG fuel storage system cost, weight, complexity, and installation efforts. Unlike conventional cylinders, Flex Tube is a composite-overbraided tubular pressure vessel that conforms to the shape of a vehicle's chassis or body. Its carbon/glass braided reinforcement is impregnated with a tough elastomeric resin over a thermo-plastic liner. The tube is terminated with metallic end fittings with valve ports. The extruded liner and overbraided reinforcement promise low manufacturing costs. Futhermore, Flex Tube provides sufficient capacity in a single continuous pressure vessel, eliminating valves and manifold hardware required by conventional multi-cylinder storage systems. By flexing and conforming to the available vehicle space, CNG capacity is maximized with minimum impact on the vehicle. The Flex Tube concept was demonstrated in a Navy submarine application. This Phase I effort further develops the Flex Tube concept and results in a fully functional prototype CNG storage system. This development encompasses system requirement specifications, materials selection, structural design, process design, prototype fabrication, and preliminary pressure testing. Anticipated Benefits: Flex Tube will allow vehicle manufacturers to readily integrate CNG fuel systems into their vehicles' structure and styling, significnatly reducing space impact and achieving system cost reductions compared to conventional CNG systems. Other applications include body conformable Self Contained Breathing Apparatus for fire fighting, rescue, confined space, and hazardous environment personnel; emergency escape breathing systems; fuel systems, hydraulic/pneumatic energy storage systems;fire suppression/extinguishing systems and like systems requiring lightweight conformable pressure containments.",

The long-term goal of this project is to develop a \"Rapid Deployment\" system for optimization applications which is based on widely available user-friendly micro- computer software. Specifically, the objective of Phase I is to prove the feasibility of translating between Lotus IMPROV (a new multi-dimensional spreadsheet) and one or more existing state-of-the-art optimization packages. The user of the proposed system will develop models in IMPROV, which will then be fed transparently to the optimization package, which will return its results to IMPROV. As part of the development process the system will be tested by end users, and as practical real-world problems will be solved.",

        "abstract": "Our goal is to develop a self-performing, one-step, semi-quantitative, visual immunometric assayfor human TSH. This assay will use whole blood as a substrate and indicate whether serum levels ofTSH in excess of 5 IU/ml are present. It will contain a built-in control to indicate successful assaycompletion. This assay will be helpful as a screen for neonatal hypothyroidism, especially in populationsthat lack the technological infrastructure required to perform currently available TSH assays. It will alsobe used to screen samples in a cost-effective fashion for the presence of an elevated TSH and thusindicate whether a sample requires a more expensive quantitative TSH assay. By allowing TSHmeasurement to be performed outside of a laboratory and by providing a screening method o detect anelevation in TSH, this assay represents a significant technical innovation. Because of its low cost andease of use, it will have considerable commercial application as a replacement for more expensive andcumbersome radio-, enzyme-linked, fluorescent, and chemiluminescent immunoassays.",

        "abstract": "Binary optics can be used for fabrication of microlenses for IR focal plane arrays (FPAs). There is a need to improve the light collection efficiency and reduction in size for the detectors to improve on the signal to noise ratio and relaxation of the cooling requirements. Binary optics lenses can be used to reduce the area of the detectors by a factor of 10 to 20. We propose to design and fabricate multiphase Fresnel lenses with high collection efficiency and F/# to 0.5 for 8-12 micrometer wavelength range. We will fabricate multiphase lens of CdTe substrate in the first phase and evaluate them. In the second phase we will fabricate microlens array on CdTe substrate for HgCdTe FPAs working with one or more FPA vendors. The technology for microlens fabrication could be used for other types of FPAs in the visible and near IR wavelenths as well as for fabrication of large lenses on wafers. The large area binary lenses can be used to replace the refractive lenses with tremendous reduction in weight and size for the optical systems in the visible and infrared. Anticipated Benefits: Microlenses on focal plane arrays will have tremendous impact on DoD systems using them and a number of commercial products can be developed using binary optic lenses which can be available in smaller size, lower weight, higher performance and significant cost advantage.",

        "abstract": "Princeton Electronic Systems proposes the development of a new type of x-ray imager for diagnostic medical imaging for field applications. The device will be easy to fabricate and will have high resolution and image quality and will be available at low cost. A detector array will be fabricated using a new material and simple fabrication technique using only two levels of photolithographic masking. The simplification of the process will make it possible to fabricate the imaging array with nearly 100% yield in almost any fabrication facility without having to invest in massive amounts of capital. A resolution of 640x480 lines will be demonstrated on 4\" wafers in the second phase. After the second phase demonstration, large area device processing will be undertaken with 2000x2000 pixel density on a 16x16\" substrate. In the Phase I, the device design will be optimized and some of the basic process issues will be resolved. Anticipated Benefits: A practical low cost x-ray diagnostic imager will have widespread application for military field hospitals as well as for all kinds of civilian medical diagnostic needs. A very large number of the imagers can be built and sold to both military and commercial customers. It will have a very significant export market of several hundred million dollars a year and create a large number of jobs.",

        "abstract": "In the last decade we have come to understand that the growth of cancer cells, in general andof breast cancer in particular, depends, in many cases, upon growth factors that will bind to and activatetheir receptors. One of these growth factor receptors is the erbB-2 protein which plays an importantrole in the prognosis of breast cancer and is overexpressed in nearly 30% of human breast cancerpatients. While evidence accumulates to support the relationship between erbB-2 overexpression andpoor overall survival in breast cancer, understanding of the biological consequence(s) of erbB-2overexpression remains elusive. The novel discovery of the erbB-2 ligand (gp3O) has allowed theidentification of a number of related but distinct biological endpoints which appear responsive to signaltransduction through the erbB-2 receptor. These endpoints of growth, invasiveness, and differentiationhave clear implications for the emergence, maintenance and/or control of malignancy, and representestablished endpoints in the assessment of malignant progression in breast cancer. The availability ofgp3O full length cDNAs provides tools necessary to acquire a better understanding of the mechanismof action of the this ligands and the erbB-2 receptor in breast cancer. These studies are designed todefine the involvement of gp3O in breast cancer. Specifically, we will construct a ligand/toxin fusionprotein in order to determine the ability of gp30-Saporin (SAP) to inhibit tumor growth of breast cancercells in vivo.",

        "abstract": "Biologically relevant environmental monitoring can be achieved using the genetic responses of microbes to environment conditions as sensors, particularly the specific and generalized responses to toxicity. The generalized toxicity response may be especially improtant when prior knowledge of the type of toxin in unavailable. Real-time transduction of the genetic responses is most commonly provided by coupling a gene encoding a bioluminescent protein to the system. However, while this works well under controlled laboratory conditions, the information content of a single luminescent signal generally is insufficient to compensate for the complexity of living systems. We propose development of a system based on multiplexing by wavelength to increase the information content of the signal transduction process. Our research has shown that the color of light emitted by beetle luciferases can be controlled by changing less than 1% of their primary structures. This unique situation should allow incorporation of functionally equivalent but distinguishable signal generators into a single sensor, thus granting internal control of the sensor response. The product of this work will be a platform design for a signal transduction system to provide reliable and robust performance of microbial sensors. The general and fundamental nature of this design will make it widely portable into different sensor configurations. Anticipated Benefits: The multiplexing system has novel and important potential applications in several markets, including \"real time\" detection of toxics in environmental samples. Advantages of this technology versus current \"rapid\" environmental diagnostics include increased sensitivity, specificity, and the potential to develop tests for defined groups of contaminants in a single biosensor.",

PRI has direct experience with this type of JVTVC system and with the 18% aluminized HTPB proplellant environment required on this program. To achieve the sponsors goals for this research program, PRI will bring together the scientific expertise of three highly competent aerospace companies, PRI, FMI and Ultramet. These companies will research all aspects of the JVTVC system involving vane configuration (airfoil and fineness ratio), materials of construction, applicable coatings, heating and structural aspects, thermochemical attack (erosion/oxidation) from the 18% aluminum solid propellant exhaust, plume and radiant heating to the retract mechanisum and tail fins. Total JVTVC system mechanical design and packaging involving ARIES solid 3D CAD modeling of suitable stowable JVTVC system designs will then accomplish maximum missile performance with active JVTVC control during initial maneuvering and at end-game.",

Other solid- state detectors are capable of reasonably high spatial resolutions; however, these systems are typically limited to less than one f/s capture rate. To date, no single solidstate architecture exists which is capable of selectively imaging at either high speed or high resolution or both simultaneously. Q-DOT proposes the feasibility analysis of a compact electronic imaging system capable of obtaining quality color or monochrome images at frame rates and spatial resolutions which are user programmable. The device consists of a silicon peristaltic charge- coupled device imaging array with GaAs amplifiers bump mounted for use as output structures. Using a novel positioning scheme, the proposed imager can provide formats programmable from 512 x 512 to 8192 x 8192 pixels with frame rates varying from 1 to 10,000 f/s. The system provides the ability to selectively monitor scenes with a wide range of frame rates and spatial resolutions to minimize communications constraints. The primary objective of this Phase I effort is to analyze the proposed imaging system for feasibility of implementation. Analytical results from Phase I will feed directly into the Phase II prototyping effort.",

Modern airborne radars with electronically steered arrays are capable of passively locating and tracking other aircraft with high accuracy. The proposed simulator will generate and position pseudo-plane waves in a 90 degrees X 60 degrees field of view. Simultaneous, multiple targets at arbitrary angular positions will be simulated in the 2 - 18 GHz range. Simulated electronic target emission including carrier, modulation, and doppler are connected to an equivalent optical signal for positioning and distribution. Smooth dynamic beam steering is done with programmable optical time delays (e.g. o-20 ns in 1 ps steps) and attenuation (e.g., 120 db in 0.006 dB steps). Target signals are transmitted to a grid of antenna sites via optical fibers. Each antenna module mounted at active sites converts the optical signals to electronic signals and drives an antenna. The entire wide-band data path can simultaneously accommodate signals ranging from 26 GHz to 18 GHz. The antenna modules are inexpensive and placed only where needed for a particular simulation. The optical fiber feed offers low cost and high performance while providing excellent isolation from neighboring antenna element and the electromagnetic environment. Phase I is devoted to preliminary system design with significant modeling of the electromagnetic environment. Phase II will realize key elements to demonstrate a prototype simulation. A complete simularor will be constructed in Phase III.",

Cost effective pultrusion of carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic resins will be demonstrated in the Phase I effort of this program. A significant increase in speed is expected with the use of pre- impregnated material that is not dependent on resin reactivity. Two part profiles will be selected that represent geometries of value to aerospace and commercial users. The structural properties and weight reduction afforded by the use of carbon fiber, as opposed to glass, will be emphasized. Feedstock products include unidirectional, biaxial and braided tape to provide the range of fiber orientation in an easy to use format. Pultrusion parameter development will identify the critical factors that are key to the production of a quality carbon fiber composite. Thermal energy management will be a primary focus of effort to establish oven residence time, tool die temperature profile and material cooling rates. A team, to work with Quadrax, has been assembled to build upon the expertise of Morrison Molded Fiber Glass, Lockheed and Composite Structures for pultrusion, airframe manufacturing and carbon fiber structures respectively. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - The current composite market for carbon fibers opens many opportunities within the aerospace and commercial markets for improving performance competition. High modulus material permits greater composite use in areas previously not accessible.

Attempts at concentrating these vectors has generally resulted in asignificant loss of infectious activity. One possibility is that the virus titer may be dependent upon thecomposition of the medium in which the viral producing cells (VPC) are grown; therefore, we will studydifferent media compositions in an effort to improve the vector titer produced by the VPC. A secondissue for the medium design is the safety and infusibility of the medium into human patients. The abilityto produce the vector supernatant in reagent medium would minimize the risk of immunizing the patientagainst foreign serum proteins in the media that might produce toxicities that could limit the usefulnessof the therapy. This would allow the direct injection of high titer virus and reduce the treatment timerequired for injected autologous VPC to produce the vectors. As a model system the PA3l7/LNL6packaging cell line that contains the LNL6 vector will be employed. The LNL6 vector carries the bacterialgene for neomycin resistance. Vector titer will be assessed using G418 resistant colony forming unitsby the G418 selection of infected NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. The regent medium will be developed with theeventual goal of producing a medium that is destined for direct infusibility into human patients.",

By suitably controlling a voltage applied normal to each of the ET film layers, a 2-D memory page can be written into the selected layer without causing cross talk in any other layers. The stored data in each ET layer can be retrieved with high fidelity. The elimination of inter-page cross talk removes the most critical obstacle that has been encountered for a long tine in the development of ET materials based 3-D optical memory. It would lead to a practical 3-D optical storage system with huge storage capacity, parallel access capability as well as very high retrieval accuracy and low bit error rate. In Phase I, ET thin films sandwiched between transparent electrodes will be fabricated and characterized to determine the feasibility of the electric page-addressability. The configuration of the stacked-layer ET media will be designed for a prototype 3-D memory system. The prototype will be developed and evaluated in Phase II. '",

WHEN A PARALLEL OPTICAL COMPUTER APPROACHES ITS PARALLEL SPEED LIMITATION, ITS PERFORMANCE CAN ONLY BE BOOSTED BY INCREASING THE SERIAL PROCESSING SPEED OF EACH PROCESSING ELEMENT. RECENTLY, A NOVEL TIME LENS HAS BEEN PROPOSED BASED ON THE WELL KNOWN ANALOGY BETWEEN OPTICAL SPATIAL DIFFRACTION AND TEMPORAL FREQUENCY DISPERSION. VARIOUS OPTICAL TEMPORAL PROCESSORS CAN BE CONSTRUCTED EMPLOYING THESE TIME LENSES. A DISTINCT ADVANTAGE OF THESE TEMPORAL PROCESSIING SYSTEMS IS THEIR EXTREMELY HIGH SPEED, UP TO PICOSECOND RANGE WITH CURRENTLY AVAILABLE DEVICES. SUCH TEMPORAL PROCESSORS, IF SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED, WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OPTICAL COMPUTING AND OPTICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGIES.

        "abstract": "Millimeter-wave system designers are limited to two terminal devices when high powers are required from a solid state device. InGaAs/InAlAs HEMTs latticed matched to InP substrates have produced excellent low noise results at millimeter-wave frequencies. The high power performance, however, is limited by the narrow bandgap of the InGaAs chamel which leads to low breakdown voltages between the drain and source. This proposed program will incorporate the wider bandgap InP material in the channel region to increase the device's breakdown voltage. The highest performance HEMT devices have been fabricated on epitaxial material grown by solid source molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Phosphorous containing compounds have traditionally been difficult to handle in a solid source MBE system. The development of a valved group V cracking source has reduced many of the complications associated with using solid phosphorous. This will be the approach taken for this proposed program. The epitaxial profile will be simulated using POSES, a program developed by Gateway Modeling which solves Poisson's and Schroedinger's equations to generate device DC operating characteristics. Once the design has been optimized, wafers will be provided to a foudry for device fabrication and test to verify the improvement anticipated through the use of an InP chamel. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - The material developed under this proposed program will be used for high power mm-wave HEMTs which will provide the system designer with an attractive alternative to two terminal devices.The system applications include secure communications at 60 GHz., cellular phone cell-to-cell commication at 35 GHz., and collision avoidance radar for automotive applications at 77 GHz.",

        "abstract": "At the present, a major barrier to the optimum utilization of adhesive bonding as a joining method in primary structures is the inability of NDE techniques to determine bond quality, and thus structural integrity. Methods that have been used to investigate bond quality include sonics, ultrasonics, holography, radiography, thermography, acoustic emission, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Since bonds degrade chemically and since, with the exception of NMR, none of these methods are sensitive to chemical degradation, it is not surprising that previous efforts at bond quality NDE have been less than successful. However, NMR is not only sensitive to chemical degradation, it is also sensitive to the presence of moisture, which is a leading cause of bond failure. Quantum Magnetics has recently shown that NMR can be used to detect heat damage, moisture, and surface cracks in the carbon/epoxy composite materials common in aerospace applications. Quantum Magnetics has also shown that NMR information can be obtained from adhesives located in close proximity to steel plates, which are ferromagnetic and produce considerable field distortion. As a result of these recent developments, NMR technology has now reached the point where it is both realistic and attractive to consider its application to the NDE of adhesive bond quality.",

These spectra when compared to the measured spectrum will provide a quick screen for flaw type. For every bearing, a spectral history can be maintained, and during routine maintenance testing, bearings that have developed wear induced flaws can be quickly identified through comparison to prior measured spectra and the computed library of flawed spectra.

The TPV power generator technology under development utilizes a patented breakthrough in internal heat recuperation (IHR) and proprietary optics design. Incorporation of IHR along with efficient optics and photocell technology will allow development of a TPV system with near term fuel to electricity efficiencies in the range of 20 - 30 percent with power densities approaching 2 -4 watts per square centimeter, depending on emitter temperature and optical/photocell efficiency. The Phase I effort will focus on selection and testing of candidate ceramic materials necessary for oxidation-resistant, high intensity, radiant combustion. Radiant intensity will be measured for the experimental bench-scale combustor design for a range of emitter temperatures. A preliminary performance analysis for a TPV photocell (with tailored bandgap) and selective bandpass filter will be developed for the emitter temperature range of interest. This project will also address the specific need for clean (low Nox) combustion possible with porous ceramic structures. These results will be sued to construct a prototype IHR burner/TPV system in Phase II. Anticipated Benefits: The proposed recuperative TPV technology can be applied as auxillary power units in hybrid vehicle applications in military and commercial markets.

Realizing the fact that system clock speed is three to five times higher than that ofprocessor speed, we propose to develop an optical clock signal distribution networks for wafer-scale interconnects. The architecture is to employ a superstrate Si/Ge waveguide array as the optical bus for signal distribution. Implementation of a waveguide layer on top of the Si-based VLS/ULSI circuit is due to the fact that the real estate of the Si wafer is already occupied by high packaging density transistors and logic gates. Broadcasting of clock signal requires another physical layer through which optical signal can be fanned out as requested.",

The diffractors will be deposited on smooth, flat substrates arranged as a planar approximation to a Kirkpatrick-Baez grazing incidence telescope. To our knowledge, this will be the first focussing telescope in this energy range. Phase I will be a conceptual design study of the telescope. The design will be based on previous Kirkpatrick-Baez telescope designs and on prior work on depth-graded multilayers. The energy range, focal length, and image scale of the telescope will be chosen to interface with the balloon payload and the spectroscopic imaging detector. We will consider the specification of the multilayer coatings, the selection of an appropriate substrate material, and the design of the mirror mount and the optical bench.

A suite of alorithms are available for copying a variety of SOI modulation formations, including: Direct Sequence Spread spectrum (DSSS), Frequency Hop, burst or transient signals, and constant modulus signals. directive antenna arrays can be used to both increase the sensitivity (detection/acquisition capability) and link margin of thse systems, by allowing the receiver to extract the received signal even in the presence of strong interference, and by allowing the transmitter to maximize the received signal energy in the direction of the SOI. As an additional benefit, these processing techniques simultaneously steer nulls in the directions of multiple interference signals.

This study emphasizes stressful conditions that typify real-world signal collection missions, and the need to separate overlapped signals with little or no a priori knowledge of their modulation types, carrier frequencies, baud rates, or other parameters. The key component of the signal separation workstation is the biresolution PTV (BRPTV) filter, a blind, adaptive PTV filter that overcomes the interference capture problem that impedes use of conventional blind PTV and non-PTV adaptive filters in many applications. The BRPTV filter is rapidly convergent and includes a variety of known modulus and known constellation cost functions. A specialized adaptive PTV filter termed the optimum linear CDMA signals such as in frequency re-use cellular radio networks. The OLCR is highly computationally efficient and exploits the orthogonality of the CDMA code set more fully than conventional CDMA receivers, to perform code-nulling on interfering CDMA signals. The OLCR can separate larger numbers of CDMA signals than conventional approaches, achieves better separation performance, and is robust over larger signal power disparities. An option is included to implement the decision-theoretic cyclic spectrum analyzer (DTCSA) for initial detection and characterization of overlapped signals. The DTCSA overcomes limitations of conventional CSAs, including large computational requirements, slow convergence, dynamic range limitations, large-signal artifacts, tone-induced clutter, and high CSA surface display density. The DTCSA provides signal parameters to the BRPTV filter and synergistically coordinates with it to provide a powerful and flexible signal separation capability.",

Such a processor is a black bos whose input and output are electrical signals. The insider, however, consists of a lithium niobate integrated optic chip incorporating modulators, switches, A/D converters, phase retarders, etc., instead of conventional electronic components. The \"power\" to drive the processor is delivered optically through fibers so that EMI problems are completely eliminated. In Phase I we will demonstrate one version of such a processor which will simply amplify electrical signals with a potential RF to RF gain of 20 dB and a dynamic range of 80 dB. We will develop techniques of passive biasing of modulators so that the amplifier will operate in the linear range. Optical wavelenghts and substrate materials will be chose for suitability for this novel application. We will also determine compatible processing functions that can be implemented in the integrated optic format and methods of implementing them in Phase II.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate that with propercalibration of the detector array, the camera system can function as an on-line, non-invasive, real-timemeasuring system of the dose and density distribution in irradiated body elements. The calibration wouldbe carried out with different sizes of water phantoms and with selected X-ray, gamma-ray, high energyelectron, or high-energy proton therapy beams.",

        "abstract": "RCS Technologies, Inc. (hereafter referred to as RCS) has developed a method for producing fine grained transparent spinel ceramics (hereafter referred to as \"RCS spinel\") that offer significant cost savings over traditional hard optical materials. RCS spinel holds the promise of producing infrared domes and windows, as well as a wide range of commercial products, at cost savings of more thatn 50%, without a significant loss of performance (compared to sapphire). Further research in the areas of near-net-shape forming and defect characterization is necessary to realize these advantages. Federal funding will enhance and accelerate the development of RCS spinel, result in the establishment of a new company, the creation of approximately 100 jobs in the near term, and the development of a dual use technology that can significantly reduce the cost of missile systems. Anticipated Benefits: The exceptional optical and mechanical properties make RCS transparent spinel useful as domes for infrared heat seeking and video based missiels, windows for bar code scanners, lenses and windows for lasers, watch crystals, wear parts - including jewel bearings, orifices, nozzles, and piston rods, stiff windows for Field Emitting Device (FED) flat panel displays, and other commerical optics, the establishment of a start-up comapny, more than 100 new jobs over the next 5 years.",

        "abstract": "Single wafer manufacturing processes can produce higher quality semiconductor devices, minimize the particulate contamination yeild loss, and greatly reduce the cost of low production volume, application specific devices. In rapid thermal processing (RTP), a wafer is heated to 700-1000 degrees Celcius in a matter of seconds with radiation from high intensity lamps. The high temperature initiates annealing, oxidation or chemical vapor deposition reactions. RTP systems have not gained widespread acceptance, and the major obstacle preventing the adoption of RTP is that current RTP systems do not provide the extremely high levels of temperature uniformity and reproducibility needed to produce high quality devices. To achieve good temperature uniformity, multiple rings of lamps are used, and the power to each lamp ring is individually controlled. Unfortunatel, deriving the necessary power-time profiles is both expensive and time consuming. Therefore, the objective of this Phase I project is to develop accurate and computationally efficient (fast) thermal models of the process using our expertise in numerical methods in collaboration with Texas Instruments. Initially, the models will be used off-line to rapidly develop power-time profiles for multizone lamp systems. Then, as the models are refined and simplified, they will beincorporated into on-line control systems.",

The correction factor is directly proportional to a heat flow through pipe wall. In FAST method, the proportional coefficient is directly calculated from 2 sets of surface temperature and heat flux measurements. Innovation in FAST method is a technique which creates 2 different thermal environments. These environments produce significantly different surface temperature and heat flow from each other, but they will leave no residual thermal disturbance to fluid or pipe. In FAST method, there are 2 heat flux sensors, both which can measure surface temperature and heat flux simultaneously. These sensors are equipped with heater and/or cooler, which are dynamically controlled in such a way that no heat will be generated or absorbed as net. FAST method is expected to produce response time and temperature accuracy comparable to a direct immersion method. FAST method and its heat flux sensor can be used many commercial applications as well as NASA rocket test facility, because of its easy installation.",

This technology has the potential to synthesize a significant fraction of the total possible 2-10 residue peptides (greater thatn 10 to the thirteen power structures) and concurrently select and amplify peptides having high affinity and specificity for any given macromolecule or macromolecular complex (referred to as peptide vectors). In many regards, these peptide vectors are like neutralizing antibodies in their specificity and affinity (though without the same potential for divalent binding or complement interaction), while they differ in that they are more likely to seek protein invaginations rather than surface epitopes and thus would be complementary to the antibody approach. In Phase I, we will demonstrate the feasibility of this technology for identifying peptide vectors for the ricin toxin. RLI is a privately held, venture-backed, biotechnology company overseen by a seasoned Board of Directors.

        "abstract": "RedZone proposes to study the unique requirements for near-shore navigation and apply these requirements to several candidate walking concepts and distill them into a single mechanism. The objective of this SBIR is \"to develop a prototype small legged vehicle capable of stable locomotion underwater for purposes of performing tasks in near-shore oceanic environments.\" In order to fulfill the military applications, the system will need to be designed to be low-observable, self-navigating and self-powering. The significant challenges to achieving this goal include a unique locomotion mechanism. Telemetry, control and power. Phase I will concentrate on the mechanism and the ambulation control algorithms capable of navigating sandy bottoms with small \"bowling ball\" sized rocks. One of the most successful applications in remote technology has been ROVs. They have been used in many applications from underwater surveillance to off-shore oil platform servicing. However, shallow environments of 100 feet and shallower are challenging for ROVs due to the various currents (in particular surges, up wells and riptides). Therefore, a machine that can walk on the bottom can handle tasks too challenging for ROVs.",

One of the major, critical components offering siginificant potential for such weight savings with titanium alloy based MMCs is the main powershaft of the engine. A major difficulty with such MMC type components is making reliable couplings such as splines or joints such as welds with other mating components. The objectives of the proposed program is to demonstrate the technical and manufacturing process feasibility for using the explosive welding process to fabricate high quality, high integrity transition joints between the MMC and steel alloy or nickel base alloy wear resistant sections of a composite shaft. The project will initially involve selecting candidate MMC/metal alloy combinations in transition joint configurations for preliminary screening tests and weld joint property data generation in the Phase I explosive welding studies. Based on the testing and analysis of the results of these studies, the optimum materials combination and joint configuration will be selected for establishing the manufacturing methodology and fabricating prototype test shafts in the Phase II portion of the program.

To be useful to pilots these systems must produce a reliable real-time indication of laser illumination with a very low false alarm rate. An effective system must also provide laser detection in a large field of view and be sensitive to wavelengths over a broad spectral range. This project will develop a single aperture laser warning receiver based on an adaptation of a Fourier Transform Spectrometer that satisfies all of these requirements. The warning receiver will utilize a stable and rugged interferometer and a unique solid-state light sensor that can provide laser detection and spectral processing on a single integrated circuit with very low power. The proposed configuration provides high optical efficiency and discriminates non-laser phenomenon based on temporal, coherence and wavelength characteristics of the incident light. Design adaptations to transition the \"spectrometer on a chip\" technology for environmental sensing dual-use will also be studies. The result of this project will be a compact cost effective laser warning receiver that is suitable for deployment on aircraft platforms.",

This will have wide commercial acceptance by thebiology and health science fields, because confocal microscopy is the most predominant present-daylight microscopy modality for obtaining 3-D anatomical information in the structural biology, neuroscienceand other biological fields, yet it suffers from a substantial residual axial smearing and severe noise. Thisresearch will substantially improve the capability to optically visualize and measure 3-D anatomicalinformation. A major importance of doing so is that, in comparison to electron microscopy, confocalmicroscopy is much less expensive and it allows one to view live specimens. A blind deconvolutionalgorithm, which does not require the optical point spread function to be measured, will be used.Instead, it inherently produces a reconstruction of the point spread function. The specific objective ofthis project is to refine and test a present algorithm version to show the feasibility of: (1) correctingthese smearing and noise limitations routinely, robustly and with realistic computer power and (2), usingthis correction to improve cellular structure visualization and morphometric measurements.",

Their utility lies in the short wavelength and high resolution of the output, making it possible to realize both high resolution features and high aspect ratios, with very precise control over the machining process. An optimization of process parameters is needed, however, before many potential commercial applications can be realized. The goal of this program is to completely investigate all of the necessary parameters affecting the ability to use the excimer laser to develop high aspect ratio, low taper angle, high resolution features in metals as applied to NASA's current need for high energy radiation collimators. Also, we will deliver representative samples to prove the concept, necessary for Phase II continuation, under which we will fabricate the end product based on Phase I studies. It is anticipated that this study will have great benefit for commercialization of other materials processing applications.",

        "abstract": "Few strategic decision-making tools are effective today in availability analysis. These tools adapt highly deterministic approaches, ignoring uncertainty and subjectiveness naturally existing when evaluating potential propulsion system technologies. Such approaches preclude the use of a rich source of knowledge available from subject matter experts. Introduced is the concept of \"fuzzy\" availability parameters for modeling uncertainty. Presented as environmental \"fact\", these statements are \"fuzzified\" by assigning linguistic values to statement value, importance, and confidence, altering relationships among parameters. Improved technologies in Influence Diagramming provide systematic approaches for collapsing models to precise, manageable parameters and relationships. The proposed approach allows a confidence-consideration of the results in a revised availability model. Technical objectives include modifying current Mil-Std 1388 model of operational availability, expanding model elements to include comprehensive factors, selecting factor units of measure and linguistic descriptors depicting various factor levels, developing environmental parameters defined by expert knowledge statements, demonstrating fuzzy set logic operations that combine factor parameters, developing a moderated factor value based on those operations, and demonstrating simulation trade-analysis with results. Phase I deliverables will be a complete availability model, measures for all factors, decision criteria, and demonstration trade analysis results of baseline and alternative propulsion technologies.",

The overall size of the system should remains small (e.g. a Kr85 fluorescence source and photovoltaic generator would produce 5 kW electric in an estimated 50 cm diameter sphere). These efficiencies compare to 7.5% for the Radioisotope Thermionic Generator (RTG) system, used in deep space probes such as Voyager, in which nuclear energy is converted to electrical energy with intermediate thermalization.

To reduce error, theprocedure is often repeated a number of times and the average of all of the readings taken. Each readingrequires a bolus injection of solution, increasing the risk of sepsis and fluid overload. Modifications tothis technique using intravascular heating elements as the thermal indicator offer nearly continuousreadings but no better accuracy. A continuous cardiac output catheter will use the arterial pressure tocalculate cardiac output. The significant difference to the approach described is a method by which thesystem may be calibrated without injection of any sort of indicator. As a result, the calibration may berepeated as often as desired with no adverse effect to the patient. The phase I studies are designed toconclusively demonstrate the feasibility of the calibration method first using a mock circulation and thana number of animal experiments to validate the data.

        "abstract": "We propose to develop optimized shared virtual memory (SVM) for message-passing machines. SVM can be implemented in a distributed memory environment much as virtual memory is implemented on uniprocessor machines. The SVM on a parallel machine would permit the user to distribute pages of a virtual memory space across processors, generating interprocessor communications for memory faults. Thus, SVM can hide the daunting task of programming interprocessor communications in a dsitributed memory space from the user, at the price of potentially decreased performance. Unfortunately, current SVM implementations do not allow the user to propagate information to the compiler or operating system which might improve performance. We propose several optimizations to SVM which could make it competitive with hand-coded message passing programs for a wide range of applications, including iterative linear Bolvers, unbtructured computational fluid dynamics codes, and FEM codes for mechanical engineering. Under this grant, we will develop two simulators to determine potential performance improvements for irregular applications running under optimized SVM. We will also address the issues arising from using portable code annotations to generate optimized SVM source code. Our final report will include a functional description and implementation plan for an optimized SVM prototype. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - Optimized Shared Virtual Memory can be used to program irregular HPC applications (e.g. iterative linear solvers, multigrid solvers) as easily as standard shared memory, while keeping performance close to that of explicit message passing code.",

        "abstract": "This proposal describes the development and analysis of a prototype scalable library for sparse matrix operations in a distributed memory environment. The library is to be object-oriented; hence, will be implemented in C++. It is designed to be portable, and therefore will adhere to the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard, but will use P4 from Argonne National Laboratory for the prototype. Finally, the class library will not sacrifice performance, and will take advantage of prescheduled communication to minimize communication costs. The class library will supports creation, deletion, updating, and remapping of matrices, matrix-vector multiply, dot product, SAXBY and DAXBY vector operations. A PCG BOlver and a GMRES solver will be implemented using the libraries, and their performance will be compared to existing solvers. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - A portable, object-oriented linear algebra library will permit users to develop easy to use, machine-independent linear solvers for use in a wide variety of scientific computing applications and environments.",

The scenario will be modeled in STR's Optimal Marginal Evaluator(OME-III/IV) so that the relative merits of force structure alternatives can be judged against simulated combat outcomes (probability of achieving objectives). To eliminate the principal disadvantages of this type of analysis (namely the time required for completion) STR will conduct sufficient analysis to build a series of outcome curves for each weapons platform, delivery vehicle, weapon and support systems of concern. Each of these systems will be defined by a series of characteristics. In the modeling phase of the project, each of these characteristics will be varied parametrically and the impact of the variation on scenario outcome defined. The impact of varying quantities of systems will also be examined parametrically. Results will be encoded in a graphic shell for easy analyst access. The analyst can then examine the impact of varying numbers of existing systems or can create a new/advanced weapon or system by changing the characteristics of the system it is designed to replace. The decision aid knows the impact of varying the characteristics of any system. It can then calculate the impact of replacing the old weapon with the new or of varying the mix of old and new systems. The decision aid can function around multiple scenarios at different levels of conventional war. It can be developed dynamically, scenarios can be added as they are completed. Given a force option, the Parametric Response Surface Naval Force Planning tool can access the response surface and immediately respond with the option's overall military effectiveness in all scenarios and assumption sets currently in the system. STR has constructed a similar system for the Air Force. This project will demonstrate the applicability of the technique to Naval Warfare.",

A safe and effectivepreventative therapy administered to patients at risk of developing colon cancer is needed. Thesestudies will examine the efficacy of a potential chemopreventive agent for colon cancer which hasshown promising activity on aberrant crypt development and colon cancer cell proliferation. Recentevidence has shown this class of compounds, the non-steroid anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to inhibitcolon tumor incidence in carcinogen induced animal models and inhibit polyp growth in humans.However, most NSAID compounds have serious and sometimes life threatening gastrointestinal sideeffects which preclude their chronic use. The drug substance, balsalazide sodium, is a colonic-specific,NSAI aminosaliclate currently undergoing multi-center Phase III trials for the treatment of activeulcerative colitis. These studies will examine, in a rat model, the efficacy of balsalazide and itsmetabolites on carcinogen-induced development of aberrant colonic crypts as a pre-cancerous lesion.Additional studies will correlate growth inhibition of colon cancer cells in culture by balsalazide, withexpression of two biomarker gene products, secretory phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and the urokinaseplasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) whose expression convey an invasive phenotype to the coloncancer cell. The results will be the basis for designing the Phase II studies which will test thechemopreventive activity of balsalazide in human trials.",

The goal is to demonstrate the capability of scatterometry to provide a PEB monitor that can be applied real-time to control the process. The scatterometers will be constructed and evaluted to determine the requirements for a scatterometer that would be built and interfaced with a PEB station in a Phase II effort to demonstrate process control. Anticipated Benefits: This Phase I effort will determine the requirements of a scatterometer that can provide PEB process control in chemically amplified resists. This class of resists are recognized as a critical path for achieving small CDs (0.25 um) of the future, and controlling PEB is essential for reliable, repeatable processing.",

The Saphikon Edge-defined, Film-fed Growth (EFG) technique will be used to produce thesapphire fibers.

All fibers used inthe study will be qualified using the Erbium laser. Pre-clinical trials conducted at the New England EyeInstitute will employ test protocols designed to parallel those used in ongoing Erbium laser clinical trialsusing a fluoride fiber/quartz tip delivery system. The objective of the trials will be to demonstrate thesurgical precision of the Erbium:YAG/Sapphire fiber laser modality. Beyond the initial demonstration ofthis modality in ophthalmic procedures, further improvement in the power handling capabilities of thesapphire fiber will allow for its use in a far wider range of applications, including: endodontic, generaldentistry, and orthopedics.",

        "abstract": "NASA requires micro-miniature precision stages which can be used for positioning of small lightweight devices such as optical mirrors. SatCon is proposing, as the essential actuator element, a micromachined, electrostatically deflected, compound cantilever. The cantilevers will be micromachined with the deep etch capabilities of the LIGA process at the Center for Advanced Microstructures (CAMD) of Louisiana State University. The cantilevers can be multiply-arranged for full-tilt control and linear positioning of small lightweight devices such as optical mirrors. Mass production is practical since molds for a complete six-degree-of-freedom can be fabricated in a single run. Since each actuator element in a set can be independently controlled, this allows not only aiming of an array of mirrors but also variable control of focal length. The development of variable focus, compact optical reflecting, and eventually refracting, elements would have significant application in consumer applications such as cameras, medical devices, and video technology. In Phase I, a geometrical design will be developed along with a viable fabrication technique consistent with the LIGA process. The efficacy of key aspects of these designs will be assessed through actual fabrication of test structures at the LIGA facility. For Phase II, prototype actuators will be fabricated and evaluated.",

Recent advances in composite materials, permanent magnet motors, bearings, and power control electronics have led to flywheel energy storage systems with specific power and energy densities exceeding those of virtually all other energy storage systems for applications requiring high power, short duration pulses of electrical power. This technology is ideal for the development of light weight, low volume, low maintenance, water resistant modules capable of delivering 25KW-100RM at over 200 VDC for up to several hundred milliseconds. The system proposed integrates new developments in flywheel rotors, electrical converters, motor/generator, and bearing technologies. The baseline energy storage module incorporates a graphite epoxy flywheel, silicon nitride bearings, and a neodymium/iron PM motor driven by a compact pulse width modulated converter operating at 80 kHz. The goal of this program is to develop an energy storage module concept having outstanding energy and power density characteristics.

Over a wafer size of 3\"x3\", the translation table has to localize to a 20x20 um zone, and within this zone have a positioning accuracy better than 10 nanometers with a sweep speed of 20 um/sec. It is perceived as a two-step positioning problem, slow long range, fast and accurate shorter range servo. Phase I concentrates on designing a fast 2 nanometer resolution X-Y positioning mechanism for the 20x20 um zone. This mechanism will be incorporated into a slower 3\"x3\" X-Y translational table at a later stage. The key to fast, accurate positioning is a fast actuator and a sensor with high handwidth, accuracy and signal/noise ration. A Terfenol-D based translational actuator together with a 915 MHz capacitive sensor fulfill these requirements adequately. The proposal outlines a Phase I program to design a X-Y translation mechanism and to provide experimental proof of concept by demonstrating a one-degree-of-freedom servo system. Phase I will pave the way for full development of a prototype instrument in a Phase II program and commercialization in Phase III.",

SatCon has identified a novel angular rate sensor which has been shown to be undamaged after gun induced accelerations of up to 25,000 g. Our device is a microfabricated adaption of the so called \"wine glass resonator\" but in a version which is electrostatically excited and sensed. A long, thin cylindrical structure is driven to produce a standing acoustic mode around the rim of the cylinder. The shift of the nodal positions is correlated with rotation rate and detected by a high frequency capacitance sensor. The rate sensor is inherently insensitive to high linear accelerations unlike cantilevers and spinning disc gyros yet insensitive to first order temperature-caused variations since resonance is electronically maintained. We have a significant opportunity to fabricate the structure with the LIGA process by virtue of our access to the CAMD facility at LSU. This technique is optimized for mold production and if combined with hybridized drive and sensing electronics, allows inexpensive mass production. The Phase I program will establish the optimum structure geometry, the details of a tailored LIGA microfabrication process, and a component level design of the sensing and drive electronics. In Phase II, the micro-resonator will be fabricated and tested with off-chip electronics.",

Our method is also crucial for our proposal: To create highly conductive, convenient plastic materials by infiltrating thermosetting or dissolved plastic material into the pores of our sturdy plugs, our felts, of fiber networks. The fibers are polycrystalline iron whiskers in the range of 0.1 - 0.5 - 1 micron, while the type of plastic can be selected. Examples are epoxy or polycarbonate.

        "abstract": "The proposed effort is to design, analyze, fabricate and test a los cost, application specific LADAR system for weapon guidance. This LADAR system must autonomously detect, locate and classify various ground targets in clutter from a SADARM like platform. Project objectives are to demonstrate that this system can be packaged into a given volume constraint and enter into production at a maximum cost goal. Previous SEO submunition LADAR sensor work indicates thta multi-channel LADAR systems provide superior performance over single-channel systems in cluttered environments, but are significantly larger and much more expensive. The best design for this LADAR system is one which would provide multi-channel performance with single-channel simplicity and low cost. SEO will design a system which provides nin-channel performance with three-channel complexity, size, and cost. This will be accomplished by constructing a three-channel transmitter and a nine-channel receiver which uses optical fibers and discrete detectors. The receiver output will be time-multiplexed through three-channel electronics. One channel of the transmitter will alternate its output polarization from pulse to pulse and the polarization of the three corresponding receiver channels will be examined to detect polarization shifts in the reflected pulse as an aid in target detection. A breadboard sensor will be constructed under Phase I to verify the design which will become the basis for Phase II.",

A novel optical pump geometry which is a modified version of the tightly folded resonator concept is proposed to increase the smplifier efficiency and to alleviate thermo-mechanical problems associated with diode pumping; this will allow a good stability, low noise, and a higher output power than what is available from a fiber amplifier. The unique design configuration also allows an intrinsically stable TEMOO mode amplifier beam profile, which can be exploited for an efficient output fiber coupling. Availability of the alser crystals and use of modular design concept will provide wide spectral coverge which includes 850, 1300, and 1500 nanometer.

        "abstract": "There is currently an active interest in the development of improved methods to decontaminate and disinfect wastewater. Direct electron beam irradiation is attractive since radical formation and attack on contaminants is energy efficient and relatively nonselective. Efficient decontamination has been demonstrated with an energy investment below 1 MRad. Although various electron accelerators have been applied, large scale implementation has been impeded by capital cost, reliabilty, and scalability. Induction accelerator technology developed at Science Research laboratory (SRL) under BMDO sponsorship will remove these limitations. Further to eliminate wastewater discharge into the environment SRL proposes a novel concept of remediating and subsequently recycling the water. Such a closed cycle system has two advantages (1) a modest reduction of toxic contaminants is required thereby significantly reducing the treatment cost and (2) the elimination of wastewater discharge into the environment. The objective of this effort is to develop a new, low cost and reliable closed cycle process for decontamination of wastewater using linear induction accelerator technology. Electron beams are produced with the SRL accelerator in a compact configuration which employs the reliability of all-solid-state switching to provide high average power through high pulse repetition rate. Preliminary tests at ARL with 500 keV electron energy have shown effective and efficient destruction of organic contaminants in water. Experiments have also been performed under ARPA sponsorship that have verified the remediation of red water which results from the production of TNT for the military. In fact, all TNT manufacturing facilities in the USA have been shut down because of the contaminated red water that is produced. All of these remediation experiments clearly demonstrate the dual use of SRL's electron beam technology. In Phase I we will use the existing SNOMAD-IV induction accelerator at SRL with recent upgrade to 1.5 MeV. This system will be coupled to a flowing contaminated water system to provide a unique facility for the proposed research.

        "abstract": "Nolinear optical imaging is proposed for in-vivo detection and imaging through biological tissue. A major application is clinical optical mammographic screening for breast cancer. Unlike conventional x-ray mammography, the proposed optical imaging technique utilizes visible radiation. Since this non-ionizing radiation poses no risk of radiation-induced carcinoma, nolinear optical breast-cancer screening examinations can be repeated periodically with no risk to the patient-a revolutionary development. This advance would be valuable to both civilian and military hospitals. The technology is alos applicable to underwater imaging, which is of interest to the Navy. Nonlinear optical imaging utilizes a single low-peak-power repetitively pulsed light source. The presence of lesions, whose absorption and/or scattering properties differ from those of the sorrounding tissue, can be determined from observation of the light transmitted through the tissue. The technique relies on nonlinear optics in specific media that function under extremely low light-power conditions and can operate in a relatively compact geometry. These nonlinear optical media provide high spatial resolution by temporally gating and amplifying light that has undergone minimum scattering, thereby discriminating against highly scattered light. The goal is an optical scan of duration 1 sec to detect submillimeter-size lesions in a 40 mm thic breast. Phase I is a theoretical effort to assess the feasibility of the technique and design a Phase II proof-of-principle laboratory demonstration. Anticipated Benefits: The major application of a nonlinear-optics imaging system is rapid, safe optical mammography suitable for clinical screening for breast cancer. Unlike a conventional x-ray mammogram, a nonlinear optical scan poses no risk of radiation-induced cancer. With an estimated US market of tens of millions of examinations per year, its widespread commercial application is assured. The technology that will be developed also has other applications, including underwater imaging.",

This active biconical antenna will be designed and be compatible with existing receivers, will be extremely low physical profile, and yet support effective reception in the HF, VHF, and UHF frequency ranges. The ultra-broadband active biconical antenna will be designed to ultimately support tactical electronic warfare, monitoring, signal intelligence, and information collection in a light weight survivable self contained pack. A number of significant design attributes of the ultra-broadband active biconical antenna design concept can be made more specific by considering the potential for: (1) Significant cost savings due to simple basic design and non expensive materials; (2) Simplicity of design model optimization; and (3) Enhancement of elementary broadband antenna design, to significantly increase low frequency performance. The technical objectives will be focused upon validating the technical merit of the design by the modeling of the active module and biconical antenna, meeting the active module design criteria, the performance of the biconical receiving antenna throughout the frequency spectrum of interest, the prototype fabrication effort, and the testing process of the prototype.",

This ability to declare an exclusionary \"keep out\" zone is also of relabence to the need for other types of area denial. The approach is to adapt the high energy acoustic beam weapon technologies (developed at SARA Inc) for the creation of the facility/area denial effect. The high power acoustic beam weapon concept provides a directed energy weapon technology with unique capabilities for area denial. This approach will make use of efficient combustion driven acoustic beam generators that allow the use of a common fuel to produce the weapon beam. Application of phased array and nonlinear acoustic interactions will greatly extend the effective range of the denial effect, while providing unique weapons interactions with the target facility. Anticipated Benefits: This technology has very significant potential to support a variety of related missions includind border security, hostage scenarios, anti-terrorism, FBI/ATF operations, DEA drug interdiction activity, National Guard/civil unrest crisis situations. In addition, the transmission of intense acoustic beams, will provide novel commercial applications including; insect irradication, fire control and remote demolition.",

        "abstract": "As a National information resource, the Internet makes available vast amounts of information to a broad range of consumers. For most users, however, only a tiny fraction of the aggregate information is significant, and the overall resource only has value if that fraction can be located reliably, quickly, and automatically. Today's tools are incapable of meeting users' needs - they are too slow and require too much manual intervention. Suitable tools can be based on the use of expert database technology in the context of software for rapid filtering of evolving data streams. This project addresses one such tool: an eXpert INformation Filter (XINF) that will cull the articles in on-line information sources to provide users with those best matching their interests. The XINF will use AI techniques to adpatively refine its knowlege of users' interests based on minimal user input and feedback, so it will be simple to use and capable to high selectivity. In addition, the XINF will be implemented using scalable computing technology, to make it indefinitely expandable - as the number of users or sources increases, the XINF will simply run in parallel on a larger number of networked computers to achieve the desired level of responsiveness. Anticipated Benefits: The technology developed in this project will be broadly applicable to one of the nation's most pressing problems: how to process and extract knowledge from the vast amount of data that is produced by numerous sources every day. Thus it can serve as the basis not only for a commercial version of te XINF service, but also for numerous other fusion applications in domains as diverse as manufacturing control, real-time data analysis, and transaction processing. For that reason, it has significant potential to enhance US industrial competitiveness and national security",

        "abstract": "Object Oriented Programming (OOP) techniques are a vital part of modern software engineering. Unfortunately, on parallel computers where the need is greatest, OOP tools are lacking. We propose to address this problem by designing a parallel OOP language. Unlike other parallel OOP research efforts, we will approach parallel OOP from the viewpoint of the parallel programming environment - not the OOP language. A parallel programming language that naturally maps onto OOP is Linda(R). Linda is based on an associative virtual shared memory called tuple space. Linda coordinates multiple processes strictly in terms of memory-entities (tuples) residing within the virtual shared memory. The chief innovation of this research is to generalize tuple space into a true \"object space\" where \"object\" is consistent with the object- concept from OOP languages. This will require many novel developments, including hierarchical tuple spaces (to support inheritance) and generalized models of process abstraction in the context of active (or processing) tuples. This innovative research will have far reaching implications. By providing better tools for parallel programmers, the quality and quantity of application software for parallel computers will increase. Also important is that this research will contribute fundamentally to the understanding of parallel OOP techniques and associative memory models. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - Parallel computing lacks the tools software engineers need to produce application software. The proposed parallel object oriented programming language will provide a key tool for the application programmer, thereby increasing the number of applications and utility of cost effective parallel computers for any industry that depends on high performance computing.",

        "abstract": "There currently does not exist a high resolution, high dynamic range, quantum limited detector of radiated emissions in the ultraviolet, visible, or near-infrared spectral regions. A proposal for a detailed design of an Avalanche CCD Imager and its supporting camera system is presented. The design provides a lwo noise gain mechanism that allows for quantum limited imaging performance to be realized in a CCD architecture. The Avalanche CCD Imager is capable of being 'gated' very rapidly with a 15 vold signal, making it ideal for undersea range-gated imaging. The Avalanch CCD Imager enables a cell-based amplification of photo-electrons. The detection device is realized by overlaying an amplifying semi-conductor structure, generally referred to an avalanche photodiode, directly on top of a charge coupled device structure. The resulting device is a hybrid of two mature tehcnologies, that, with certain provisions, allow the two technologies to function properly as a single integrated unit. The application of the proper voltage bias will effect avalanche conditions in each cell. Avalanche conditions can be turned off so as to effect high light level operation which may not require electron amplifications; avalanche conditions can also be varied so as to effect variable amplification and 'gating'. Finally, device driver circuitry, output amplification, analog-to-digital conversion, and statistically appropriate photon counting thresholding will produce a photon counting camera with well-characterizable performance properties. As a part of this Phase II program, SIT, Inc. will fabricate and test features of the Avalanche CCD. These test results will be used to design and model an Avalanche CCD Imager to meet the requirements of a Navy mission of interest. The device designed in this Phase I SBIR program will address the major technical challenges that, to date, have prevented the development of similar types of devices.",

Increased loading and operating requirements cause serious mismatch between stages and components during off-design conditions with attendant compromise on stability margin. Another factor that affects component efficiencies is deviation in predicted performance due to in-flight damages and component aging. This deviation can propagate into more serious problems if not detected in time. More importantly, the deviation may be misinterpreted by control and decision unit as problems in other components. Misinterpretation of failures is crippling to future engines and aircrafts that incorporate performance seeking control methodology to optimize system performance on the fly. To ensure reliable and sustained improvement in subsystem performance, accurate monitoring and diagnosis are essential; therefore, the firm proposes to conduct a program of research and development on on-line monitoring of engine performance and advanced algorithms to identify compression system instabilities.

Due to nonlinear dynamics, constraints on states and controls and modeling uncertainities, the flight control optimization problem involves local optima and nondifferentiable cost functions. This necessitates the use of global search methods such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Adaptive Partitioned Random Search (APRS) methods. We have shown that for a class of signal processing problems involving global maximization of a likelihood function over unkown frequencies, APRS is more efficient than GA.

A number of devices exist that accurately measure IOP. Contact devices riskcorneal abrasion, reaction to topical anesthetics and spread of infection. Non-contact devices using airpuffs for applanation are in widespread clinical use including home tonometry to a limited extent. Thereis a clear demonstrated need for a non-contact tonometer that can continuously read IOP and alsoprovides safe and easy use by patients or technicians. Our premise is that the eye, when subjected tosmall vibrations, has inherent acoustic resonance frequencies that are a function of intraocular pressure.A measurement of these frequencies and their shifts with iOP will provide a demonstration of thefeasibility of this approach. In phase I a prototype instrument will be constructed and its performancewill be verified in bench model systems.

This new source combines the unique high power and proven reliability of SDL laser diodes with newly emerging fiber technology. A future commercial superfluorescent fiber could become a low-cost source since the components are similar to those used in fiber amplifiers for telecommunications. This approach has inherently higher reliability than superluminescent diodes and is easier to scale to higher broadband power. Since the light is generated inside a single mode fiber, efficient coupling to fiber sensors is assured and the output can be easily distributed to remote locations via low loss fiber.

This has spawned a proliferation of commercial, military, industrial and medical applications and associated pump array products. This demands development of flexible manufacturing techniques if costs are to be minimized and markets fully exploited. SDL Inc. proposes a total manufacturing strategy that insures maximum manufacturing flexibility in four major levels of diode array manufacture. Aluminum free quaternary growths will be developed so as to allow common reactor technology to be used for all wavelength products. Next an advanced array submount will be developed capable of highest duty cycle of operation and lowest cost allowing a common submount for all products. Common lithography-based cooler technology and common high brightness optics technology will be defined and developed for the full range of packaged products. Finally, the common precision fixturing required for diode array manufacture will be adapted to a common and flexible lithography based technology. Together, these symbiotic advances in flexible manufacturing will allow the cost advantages of scale in this dispersed marketplace. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - Reducing cost and lead time for producing new diode array packages would eanble system designers to incorporate laser diodes in ways that would otherwise be impractical due to time and/or monetary constraints. This would expand markets, stimulate growth of the technology and benefit both DoD and commercial users by allowing lower price due to larger volume markets.

Given this lack, current absorption sensors are based on broadband lamps or electrochemical cells, which have comparatively poor resolution and sepcificity. However, SDL has developed a technology that can provide a tunable mid-IR source based on coventional diode laser materials in a simple, rugged, robust package. In this program, SDL will develop a complete gas monitoring module combining a tunable mid-IR laser source with optics, control, and calibration electronics that can, by swapping in and out diode sources, be used at any wavelength in the 2-5 um band. The gas sensor developed in this proposal will be small, simple, and low cost, and can be configured for a wide range of gases wavelenths.

THE QUALITY AND RELIABILITY OF P/M PARTS COULD BE IMPROVED DRAMATICALLY BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF A RELIABLE AND ECONOMIC NONDESTRUCTIVE INSPECTION METHOD CAPABLE OF DETECTING CRACKS, LAMINATIONS, AND OTHER PARAMETERS AFFECTING A PART PERFORMANCE.  RECENT WORK INDICATES THAT EDDY-CURRENT METHODS HAVE EXCELLENT POTENTIAL FOR NONDESTRUCTIVE INSPECTION OF P/M PARTS.  IT IS ALSO EVIDENT THAT EDDY-CURRENT RESPONSES FROM P/M PARTS ARE OFTEN MUCH MORE COMPLEX THAN FROM CONVENTIONAL METALLURGICAL PARTS AND ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IS REQUIRED TO PERMIT APPLICATION OF EDDY-CURRENT TECHNOLOGY ROUTINELY TO P/M PARTS, PARTICULARLY GREEN OR UNSINTERED P/M PARTS.

Nonradioactive, immunometric or \"sandwich\" assays using enzymes for signal generation(EIAs) have generally replaced radioimmunoassays for high molecular weight analytes. Low molecularweight analytes such as the steroid hormones, however, are measured primarily by competitiveimmunoassays using 125I-labeled haptens as the tracer. We manufacture and sell AquaLiteTM, arecombinant form of the calcium-activated photoprotein aequorin, which has been conjugated tomonoclonal antibodies and used as the signal in sensitive bioluminescent immunometric assays for TSHand Interleukin-6. We will synthesize an AquaLite-labeled testosterone for use in a competitiveimmunoassay format for this steroid hormone. The validation of this bioluminescent assay during thefirst phase of this project will define the feasibility for use of AquaLite as a general replacement of 125Iin competitive immunoassays. The assay will be optimized and compared to currently available assays.Once feasibility is established for the testosterone assay, Phase II of this project will be menu expansionby conversion of additional steroid hormone radioimmunoassays to bioluminescent immunoassays andthe development of an FDA approved clinical diagnostic product line for sale by us.",

ALSO, PRODUCERS OF SEMICONDUCTOR WAFERS, SEMICONDUCTOR CHIPS, AND PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS ARE CONSIDERING TWO-DIMENSIONAL CODES DUE TO LACK OF SPACE FOR THE AMOUNT OF DATA THAT NEEDS TO BE ENCODED.  THE MOST RELIABLE, ACCURATE, AND FASTEST TECHNIQUE FOR READING 2-D CODES WOULD BE A SOLID-STATE SCANNING APPROACH.  OF THE VARIOUS TECHNIQUES AVAILABLE, STRESS-OPTICS, USING AN IMPOSED STRESS IN PHOTOELASTIC MATERIALS, IS THE BEST FOR SMALL BEAMS AND FAST, PRECISE SCANNING THROUGH RELATIVELY SMALL SWEEP ANGLES.  STRESS CAN PRODUCE A MUCH GREATER INDEX CHANGE IN SOME GLASSES THAN CAN AN ELECTRIC FIELD IN E-O MATERIALS AND RESPONSE RATES UP TO MHZ ARE POSSIBLE.  ALSO, THE IMPOSITION OF A STRESS TO OPTICAL GLASS DOES NOT INCREASE ITS ALREADY LOW-LOSS, AND THE RESPONSE IS NON-DISPERSIVE.  FINALLY, OPTICAL GLASSES ARE GENERALLY MORE RUGGED AND ENVIRONMENTALLY STABLE AND COST LESS THAN DO THE MATERIALS USED IN OTHER APPROACHES.  THE MANUFACTURABILITY OF THE BASIC S-O SANDWICH IS STRAIGHTFORWARD WHICH WOULD MAKE IT SIGNIFICANTLY CHEAPER THAN EO EQUIVALENT DEVICES.

These are precisely the requirements identified as needed in the Hybrid Propulsion System Technology subtopic. The fuel property data needed for characterization will be identified and provided by appropriate regression rate measurements. AMROC routinely measures fuel regression rates by using subscale test motors; a method will be developed to use these data directly to determine the internal ballistics of any hybrid motor using the same fuel. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis will be provided to accomplish the accurate coupling of the many phenomena which occur simultaneously in a hybrid. Measurements from a large scale hybrid motor test firing will be used as a final validation of the methodology.",

This achievement will advance the performance of solid state camaras by more than an order of magnitude. The initial application will be as a detector for an optical correlator but the camera will find use in many situations where the 256:1 - 512:1 dynamic range of conventional CCD cameras is inacequate. During Phase I, we will work with a 512x512 CCD with 16 output taps to evaluate its suitability in terms of both signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range. At the end of Phase I, we will deliver a working prototype camera together with a design for a full camera to be developed during Phase II. The David Sarnoff Research Center (Princeton, NJ) will provide technical support as well as sample CCDs.",

This general lack of confidence for AI components has prevented a wider acceptance of KBS use in DHS. The challenge is how to test the logic, rules, algorithms and inference engines in the context of traditional S/W systems. The goal of this SBIR is to address the issues associated with V&V/testing of DHS combining conventional and KBS software. We propose to provide designers, developers and testers with methodologies and tools to support their activities. To accomplish this goal we will: 1) Develop formal methodologies for integrating KBS with conventional software, with specific emphasis on the process of V&V/testing of DHS. 2) Develop a data base of V&V tools that can be commercialized. We will also become uniquely qualified for providing independent V&V/testing to systems incorporating KBS.",

One obvious method would be a lightweight unit composed of a membrane system capable of successfully processing these complex waters. Membrane systems composed of spiral elements, hollow-fine fibers and ceramic filters that have been tested over this period have all suffered severe flux declines operating on these waters. This Phase I proposal is directed toward demonstrating the feasibility of utilizing a low-fouling hydrophilic, ultrafiltration or nanofiltration membrane, incorporated in a high velocity spinning device designed to minimize fouling and promote ease of cleaning, for the processing of graywater and oily wastewater feeds aboard ship. This rotating membrane system utilizes the process of centrifugal action and shear forces to prevent membrane fouling common to spiral-wound elements. The open channels in the unit eliminates the need for mesh-type turbulence-promoting spacers that can plug with solids and lower the system performance. This leads us to conclude that fouling should not be a high-flux membrane developed during this program offers excellent promise of success.",

There exists an opportunity for using GPS to provide a global clock to dispersed mobile platforms, and create an innovative, inexpensive wireless Wide Area Network for a variety of uses. Shawn Systems is proposing a unique marriage of GPS and computer networking technology through an RF medium that can create a host of new and innovative applications. Besides routine message handling, we have given two detailed application examples, viz., Collision Avoidance and Identification Friend or Foe utilizing our Wide Area Network (WAN). We have received excellent input from industry and academia and we are seeking government funding/involvement in promoting this WAN. We have faculty from MIT and UMASS advising us on areas of Aviation Safety and Radio Networks. Our partners in industry will help in commercialization of the technology. We will also be bringing our expertise in fault tolerance to make the WAN highly reliable. Avionics equipment is size constrained, and Shawn Systems wishes to leverage MCM technology to address packaging/size issues. Anticipated Benefits: Military and Commercial users will benefit immensely from implementing our WAN technology. It has tremendous dual use potential in the following applications: tracking, delivery vehicles, taxis, cargo, stolen cars, providing individual message service, collision avoidance for aircraft and ships, etc..",

        "abstract": "The premise of this SBIR topic assumes that a combination of Gabor and Wigner transforms can maintain Wigner's superior time-vs.- frequency gram resolution for characterizing non-stationary signal behaviro (relative to the time-vs.-frequency gram resolution achieved by the classical shorti-time Fourier transform) while eliminating the cross-term artifacts that are normally detrimental to grams produced by the Wigner transofrm. Under this premise, the only issue remaining to make this combination a viable time-frequency analysis technique for nonstationary signals is the development of algorithmic solutions that determine the Gabor coefficients. The co-investigators for this proposal have discovered, through a previous study of the Gabor-Wigner combination, that a modification of a high-resolution parametrric spectral analysis technqiue, origianlly developed for stationary signals, can generate time-frequency grams for non-stationary signals with better resolution than that of the Wigner and without aqny cross-term artifiacts. We propose to complete the development of ths new high-performance spectral analysis technqieu during the Phase I project, and to demonstrate conclusively tits superior capabilities in analysing complex highly non-stationary signals.",

        "abstract": "We present a waveform adaptive approach to processing active sonar signals whose waveforms are distorted by propagation in shallow water dense multipath environment. Our approach is based on parametric modeling of the received signals, assuming a known signal structure with unknown parameters. The optimal processor consists of a bank of matched filters \"tuned\" to all possible values of the signal parameters. Direction implementation of this processor is computationally prohibitive. However, a practical computationally efficient implementation is proposed using the Polynomial Phase Transform (PPT). The PPT is a novel and powerful nonlinear transform for the analysis of highly non-stationary signals. This transform have been used very successfully for estimating the parameters of constant-modulus signals of the type commonly used in radar and sonar systems. One of its remarkable properties is that the PPT converts broadband signals whose phase is a polynomial function of time (Linear and Quadratic FM, for example) signal into a single tone! The objective of the proposed project is to develop and test the waveform adaptive processor and its PPT-based implementation. In Phase I the potential of the proposed algorithm will be demonstrated by a combination of analysis and tests on synthetic data, and some recorded data. An extensive testing on real acoustic data will take place in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Attempts to perform self-noise reductin of own combat vehicle and weapon system acoustic signatures in aero-acoustic sensor signals using classical noise cancellation algorithms have not been very effective. Classical algorithms are based on estimation of autocorrelation and cross correlation functions from the data under a stationary (non-time-varying) assemption or under the assumption of a very slowly time-varying signal (for example, the Widrow LMS algorithm makes this assumption). However, a time-frequency analysis of the acoustic signature of an actual combat vehicle shows that these assumptions are not valide, so it is no suprise that the classical methods do not work well. It is shown in this proposal that not only are the self-noise signatures highly time varying, but there are further exploitable signature characteristics that can be used to improve the reduction or cancellation of the self noise. These include a high degree of spectral redundancy (or spectral correlation) and evidence of nonlinear effects in the generation of the combat vehicle exhaust acoustic signature. This proposal addresses signal processing alforithms that exploit the highly time varying nature of the signature and the spectral redundancy inherent in the signal.",

This type of transmission capability would allow for low-power image transmission using existing communication hardware. Q-DOT proposes a real-time image compression system based upon optically based wavelet decomposition. Optical processing allows for massively parallel processing of the image data. A novel electro-optic spatial light modulator is used to preprocess the image by programmably correlating the input image with a wavelet basis set. The image compression system is programmable allowing the wavelet basis (resolution set) to be optimally selected based upon the operating scenario. The system proposed is independent of the type of image data and is therefore compatible with a variety of image types including LADAR, conventional visible light, infrared and even RADAR data. The Phase I objective is to analyze the technical feasibility of the proposed image compression system including prototyping an electro-optical modulator cell which is key to the compression concept. The experimental and theoretical data gathered during Phase I will provide the foundation needed for a Phase II development effort.",

Without training, stress and high workload are known to produce specific types of judgment errors, including a narrowing of attention in which critical information may be overlooked, and an increased reliance on simplifying assumptions which may result in a tendency to ignore relevant information. The following are needed: (1) a training environment in which a trainee can develop an understanding of the interdependencies of tasks and information sources; (2) a training environment that promotes the development of common perspectives of situations among team members; (3) outcome measures that assure that these perspectives are responsive to evolving situations; (4) a training environment that represents the crucial elements of a time-critical, mass conflagration situation, while providing responsive training support. This phase I proposal will result in a specification for a prototype virtual environment (VE) training system, capable of representing the critical features of the shipboard damage assessment situation. The objectives are: (1) understand the damage control situation; (2) evaluate existing instructional techniques, capabilities of VEs, and methods of assessing team performance; (3) relate damage control training which integrates instructional techniques with VE capabilities to meet training requirements; (5) develop a system specfication.

        "abstract": "Digital communications networks require hard wired electrical connections to link multiple nodes in a network. Wired connections tether a system and inhibit the relocation of network nodes in a cost effective manner. Additionally, there is an increasing need for protable wireless digital communications links due to the ever growing presence of portable computer equipment. Solid State Technologies (SST) has patented a wireless system for communication between computers using infrared light as the carrier medium. The research objectives in this Phase I proposal include development of an optical integrating sphere high bandwidth signal processing electronics, and bonding techniques for mounting LED dice to the sphere and transparent conductor deposition on the spherical surface. The sphere will then be tested in a state of art network laboratory setting. Advantages anticipated include increased data rate, extremely compact form factor, minimal component count, and the elimination of the need for aiming devices at each other to establish a link up. Device performance and ease of use/setup would make IR mobile communications a practical and efficient medium. In military LAN applications, this translates into fast, effective ID and location data for each soldier and a non RF means of soldier to soldier communications and logistics updates. Anticipated Benefits: Defense: Interrogation-response applications (e.g., soldier or vehicle friend or foe\" ID); Transportation: (IVHS) inter-vehicle communications, and vehicle-beacon communications; Factory/Industrial: Factory LAN systems for host/machine communications; Wireless ID tags on equipment for interrogation/response purposes that only respond to a direct optical scan would prevent the \"mass response\" problems that occur using RF tags.

However, theduplexes formed between antisense oligonucleotides and a target RNA can be dissociated by ribosomesduring translation. Our objective research is to develop a technique for attaching an antisense moleculeto its target after paring. Such a complex should be resistant to dissociation and thus increase both theeffectiveness of the antisense procedure and the number of sequences that can be targeted. Theapproach can also be adapted to antigene strategies. In this case, a triplex is formed in which the addedthird stand is attached to the target duplex DNA. The antigene approach has the advantage ofinactivating gene expression at the DNA source, which is generally present in only one of a few copies,whereas RNA can be present in thousands of copies which are constantly being replaced. The antisenseversion of this proposal will be developed using tumor necrosis factor alpha mRNA as a model target.Phase II will involve applications of this procedure to the inhibition of gene expression in cultured cellsand its extension to DNA targets.",

Power MOSFETs match the need for applications with voltages below 1000 volts, but are not presently available with higher voltage ratings. It is proposed to develop a power MOSFET with a voltage rating of 5000 volts. Increasing the blocking voltage unavoidably results in increased on-state resistance per area, so more silicon area will be required to maintain a reasonable (10 ) on-state resistance. Increasing the silicon area results in turn in increased capacitance, which slows turn-on. To maintain fast turn-on, it is proposed to incorporate structural changes to the gate region which have been demonstrated to speed turn-on by reducing the capacitance and series resistance of the gate circuit. Most of the proposed changes are already used in the most recent generation of integrated circuits, but have not yet been adapted by power MOSFET suppliers. The design of the proposed devices will be verified using industry proven process and device simulation programs SUPREM and PISCES, which were developed at Stanford Unversity with support from the US Army.",

        "abstract": "Composite materials comprising an active piezoelectric phase and a passive polymer phase offer significant advantages over their single phase counterparts. These include higher electromechanical performance and vastly enhanced design versatility. Several combinations of polymer/ceramic connectivity are feasible of which 0-3 and 1-3 connectivity have emerged as the most practical. The so called \"dice and fill\" technique of cutting two sets of grooves in a block of piezoceramic at right angles to each other and subsequently casting a polymer into the grooves is the most widely employed method for realizing 1-3 connectivity. This method is quite simple but requires time consuming repetitive dicing with a relatively expensive precision saw and is suitable for only making square posts with facing parallel surfaces that are symmetrically distributed in the composite. The situation potentially gives rise to undesirable inter-post resonant activity. This problem may be eliminated if circular posts distributed randomly, or pseudo-randomly, are used instead. An inexpensive yet versatile technique for fabricating 1-3 connectivity is proposed comprising ceramic posts whose distribution in the composite is tailored to the application. The method is versatile enough to implement performance enhancing properties such as apodization of ceramic content (both lateral and axial) to reduce sidelobes in imaging arrays, control over the distribution of posts within the structure to reduce crosstalk, and, the use of aligned compressible inclusions for improving the overall efficiency of the composite. The technique is useful for achieving greater than 40% ceramic volume fraction composites in the 100 kHz-8 MHz frequency range for underwater sonar and medical imaging applications. Preliminary data for samples fabricated at 800 kHz and 4 MHz are presented with electromechanical coupling coefficient (kt) as high as 0.75.",

        "abstract": "A warfare system design that uses an open architecture implementation offers the possibility of reducing the life cycle costs, while making it feasible to easily incorporate advancing technology. However, the turbulent nature of the high technology market makes development and maintenance of such a system a challenging effort. The difficulty lies in accurately predicting where the commercial market will be in the near and distant future. The trick is to pick the probable market winners while avoiding the market losers. Viable solutions must maximize the synergism between the open architecture trend in the commercial market and the trend in naval warfare system development. We propose a study to define and develop an Open Architecture Stability Investigation System (OASIS) to explore the dynamic nature of the open architecture market. We will identify criteria that enable future warfare system designers to select appropriate Application Programming Interface (API) layers that provide a stable foundation for the warfare system's applications framework. We will place special emphasis upon selecting criteria to evaluate potentially viable upward migration paths for these API foundtions. This will permit the warfare system to easily incorporate advancing technology by simply upgrading selected components of their API foundation.",

The significance of the autonomous processor is to allow near real-time extraction of accurate coastal sea surface height information and is applicable to Navy operations such as coastal navigation and coastal military maneuvers. The proposed approach is to improve the currently available state-of-the-art algorithms which employ maximum likelihood estimators, by (1) introducing adaptive algorithm to modify the estimator accordingly for processing of waveforms over different surfaces and terrains, and (2) improving the computational speed of the processor, for consideration of autonomous operation onboard of the satellite. The proposed six-month Phase I effort includes (1) a complete evaluation of existing waveform tracking algorithms, e.g., Brenner et al., [1993], Srokosz and Challenor, [1988], Rodriguez [1988], and Rapley et al., [1983], (2) the conceptual design of the adaptive, maximum likelihood estimator for altimeter waveform processing, and (3) a proof-of-concept initial development of the proposed waveform processor.

An example problem is the rigorous solution of the Earth's gravity field using massive satellite data. Currently, such a solution can easily exhaust the central memory of conventional supercomputers (Cray Y-MP/C90) and storage requirements (tera-byte storage). The proposed investigation will apply coarsely-grained MPP (1) techniques to develop tools capable of generating scalable, parallel, and system-independent algorithms (1) to accumulate and to process very large data sets for a least squares system, and (2) to solve the resulting large linear system of equations. The proposed approach include developing tools parallel to build parallel codes for efficient computation of recursive spherical functions and for parallel processing of massive data sets. The MPP utilities to be used for the tool development include the Parallel Virtual Memory (PVM) and Distributed Queuing System (DQS). Phase I objectives identified include the overall design of the proposed algorithm development and the initial proof-of-concept effort to apply the tools to an established large-scale linear system software system (LLISS) in a small array of MPP computing environment (workstations) to solve an example problem. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - The anticipated results of the investigation include tools that can produce a new class of generalized parallel and scalable algorithms capable of solving a very large least squares system. The solution of the identified example problem, i.e., the rigorous solution of Earth's gravity field, will provide scientific advancements in areas of geophysics and computational mathematics.

        "abstract": "There are significant theoretical advantages to using arrays of high resolution microlenses for photolitography. Some of these derive from the fact that optical aberrations scale with lens size and are therefore small for microlenses. Microlenses are extremely reproducible, can be fabricated from fused silica producing good quality ultraviolet lenses, and their curved surfaces are atomically smooth as they are not formed by polishing. Sensors can be integrated into this optical system to improve the focus of such a system in real time. Adaptive control could allow to improve the focus of such a system in real time. Adaptive control could allow the microlens array to correct for nonplanar topography on a semiconductor wafer, for example. Using an array of microlenses, a large exposure field can be printed with uniform quality. Field flatness problems can be greatly reduced in such designs. By exploiting massive parallelism, high throughput can be achieved. Thus it is possible to eliminate photomasks for short turn-around production runs as is desirable in ASIC fab lines or multichip module fabrication. We propose to study the feasibility of such an autofocus system, towards the end of building a bench model prototype. Applications include: Manufacture of integrated circuits; manufacture of photomasks; manufacture of flat panel displays; inspection of photomasks; inspection of semiconductor wafers. Anticipated Benefits: If successful, the project will result in an improved lithography and inspection for semiconductor wafer and photomask manufacturing. This will help to improve or maintain national competitiveness in the semiconductor and related industries.",

Significant numbers of afflicted individuals who are not candidates for eitherbypass surgery or angioplasty as therapeutic procedures for the treatment of myocardial ischemia willbenefit from a technique for accomplishing direct revascularization. A non-divergent laser beam locatedat the distal tip of a subcutaneous catheter would provide an operator with the critical control neededto create precise cylindrical channels in the wall of the left ventricle, without opening the chest cavity.We will accomplish this task by using arrays of AlGaAs lasers, configured as one centimeter bars, topump a miniature Er:YLF laser, emitting at the 2800 nm water absorption band. A catheter housing willbe designed that places the miniature Er:YLF laser, on the order of one centimeter long, at the tip of thecatheter; pumping energy will be conveyed to the tip via a glass optical fiber. We presently producesdiode laser arrays featuring power levels of 2500 W/cm, sufficient for performing tissue ablation. Anoptical integrator will couple the optical energy from the diode laser bar into the circular fiber. Theproposed effort will establish conditions, including spectral watching and input/output coupling formaximum energy transfer for effectively coupling the output flux from an array of laser diodes into thefundamental mode volume of the solid-state laser.

Theoretical calculations predict that InTlSb offers many potential advantages over HgCdTe and III-V quantum well infrared photodetectors (QWIP). Its higher mechanical strength and better compositional uniformity promise improved focal plane array performance and yield. Also, since it is lattice-matched to InSb, the substrate cost is lower than that of the CdZnTe in which HgCdTe is grown. In comparison to QWIP, InTlSb offers normal incidence detection and higher quantum efficiency. In(1-x)Tl(x)Sb with Tl compositions greater than 5% will be achieved by raising the cyclopentadienylthallium (CPTl) bubbler temperature to 150 degrees celcius and using a new Tl source, isopropylcyclopentadienylthallium, which has a higher vapor pressure than CPTI.",

In Phase II, a working matrix of red, green, and blue (RGB) EL devices for a full-color display panel will be developed. Spire recently fabricated the first Si-based light-emitting diodes configured as heterojunctions between an electrochemically-processed p-type porous Si and an n-type transparent semiconductor (indium-tin-oxide). Quantum confinement in Si nanostructures is the key to the luminescence of these devices. These LEDs emit yellow, orange, and red light: The fabrication of a porous Si-based blue LED is presently being investigated at Spire with government funding. Although most previous work on porous silicon devices has employed bulk Si materials rather than Si thin films, Spire has shown that bright visible light can be obtained from porous structures formed on polycrystalline silicon thin films deposited on quartz substrates. Spire now proposes to extend this development to create a novel thin film electroluminescent (TFEL) technology based on porous polysilicon films. Such a technology would be not only more economical and practical than conventional practice, but could also offer the monolithic integration of display elements with the thin film transistor (TFT) chip-on-glass driver circuits.",

Among the many advantages of these InAs/GaInSb SLS detectors are excellent uniformity, normal incidence detection, intrinsic absorption, small leakage current, reduced Auger recombination, and compatibility with III-V leakage current, reduced Auger recombination, and compatibility with III-V optotelectronic devices. The unique properties of InAs/GaInSb superlattices will permit both photoconductive and photovoltaic detectors to be constructed.

        "abstract": "Alternative growth substrates such as CdZnTe/GaAs/Si promise to reduce the manufacturing cost of today's advanced infrared focal plane arrays (IRFPAs). Current MOCVD growth processes operate in an uncontrolled mode and require frequent calibration runs to maintain reproducibility. This results in reduced yield and throughput and, therefore, increased costs. The goal of Phase I is to identify and demonstrate the feasibility of compatible sensor technologies which can provide in-situ monitoring and feedback control of wafer growth in the CdZnTe material system. We will implement two types of sensors: the first will measure the concentration of reactant sources in the gas phase. This data can be used to provide real-time control of film growth-rate and composition. The second is a wafer sensor which measures film thickness and composition during growth. An innovative, high-uniformity, single-wafer reaction chamber incorporating the control sensors will be designed for first-pass success of complex device structures. A breadboard demonstration of the key sensors will establish the feasibility of our proposed approach in Phase I. In Phase II, the reaction chamber will be built and real-time feedback control will be demonstrated. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - Development of a feedback- controlled reactor will significantly advance the state of the art in MOCVD materials growth. Feedback-controlled reactors will be attractive to manufacturers of multi-layer III-V and II- VI devices such as photodiodes, laser diodes, HBTS, and solar cells. Additionally, the ability to produce complex device structures at significantly improved yields will result in lower cost of commercial wafers.",

Site-specific human health risk assessments of petroleum contamination, particularly at weathered sites, may save millions of dollars in cleanup costs. However, many risk factors necessary to conduct such risk assessments are not available. Specifically, the risk factor does not exist for long-chain petroleum hydrocarbons (LCPHs) which are components of petroleum products, primarily diesel fuels. This proposal focuses on development of a risk factor for LCPHs in order to facilitate future site-specific health risk assessments at petroleum sites. In addition, a petroleum contamination site at an Air Force installation would be identified for a demonstation study of cleanup costs based on non-risk-based regulatory cleanup standards versus risk-based cleanup standards.",

The procedure poolsranks across raters to determine a final \"global outcome rank\". A rank procedure, e.g., theMann-Whitney statistic, tests treatment effect. Phase I, which stresses applications to cardiovasculardisease, has three aims: (a) Investigation of feasibility of the approach by reanalyzing the SHEP (1) data.The rating assessments will incorporate different lengths of follow-up and varied severity of events.Phase I will (i) evaluate agreement between raters, (ii) study approaches for rating large numbers of RCTparticipants, and (iii) compare tests of treatment differences using subjective endpoints to standardmethods; (b) Consideration of general methodological issues related to statistical power in subjectiverankings; (c) Preliminary design of the prototype software package.",

This can be accomplished through the automated use of previous experience, which consists of information on existing parts. The feasibility of an automated system which uses existing components as cases to aid the obsolescence prediction for a current part will be demonstrated by the development of a prototype with a broad corss-section of information on existing parts. The use of cases of past experience to make estimates of the current situation is referred to as Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). CBR often overcomes problems encountered with the use of traditional methods. Using a CBR strategy for obsolescence prediction is both innovative and can lead to commercial applications. Obsolescence prediction by its nature resists accurate calculations. By basing the estimate on similar cases, far greater accuracy can be achieved. The Phase I effort will focus on the design of the knowledge base structure for the information on existing components, the evaluation of several obsolescence prediction strategies based on the case base, as well as initial experimentation with user interfaces.",

Subsequent infection of E. coli, allows mutationsto be visually scored by blue/white color selection of plaques, formed on an E. coli lawn. Small speciesof fish have been used extensively in evaluating carcinogenicity of test compounds, and have shownthemselves to be useful in identifying human carcinogens prior to rodent bioassay. Therefore, afish-based mutagenicity assay will allow a more in-depth evaluation of suspected mutagens by extendingmultiple species testing. However, unlike current rodent bioassays, a fish-based mutagenicity assay willalso allow in-depth evaluation of mutagens contaminating aquatic ecosystems and open new avenuesof testing compounds prior to release into the environment. In addition, the ability to visualize embryonicdevelopment combined with the ready supply of large numbers of fertilized eggs will allow this assayto be adapted to analyzing mutagenic-potential of teratogens. During phase I the feasibility ofconstructing transgenic fish will be explored; in phase II, the system will undergo further developmentby producing high copy fish and initial testing of mutagens.",

Bridge safety is a major component of the nation's road infrastructure and is therefore of particular interest to the USDOT and the IVHS program. The Georgia DOE has agreed to participate with Strain Monitor Systems, Inc. to accomplish the tasks of the program. Phase I tasks will cover the design and development of peak strain and deflection-based instrumentation systems for monitoring the structural conditions of a number of bridges specified by the Georgia DOT. The technology offered is a unique modification of development accomplished under the sponsorship of the DOD and DOE and has far reaching dual-use applications. The instrumentation systems are intended to evaluate the local material response at specific points within a structure and to be used to estimate, among other things, the level of damage a structure has suffered and its resulting condition. The work will include structural analyses of the chosen sites, design of several sensor types, full static and dynamic tests on the prototypes, and investigation of site-specific system designs. Phase II will entail the fabrication and installation of prototype sensor systems. The project is expected to provide a full feasibility evaluation of the sensor technology.

Piezoelectgric motion control of the OPO crystals will provide wavelength tuning with no change in laser alignment or pointing direction (boresight). The laser will be diode-pumped for efficiency and capable of operating at pulse repetition rates of l0 KHz, average powers of 1-2 Watts and peak pulse powers of l0 KW, with continuous wavelength tunability from l.4 to 4 um. This approach will provide a laser radar with wavelength agility to provide eyesafe opeation, tuning to defeat wavelength dependent countermeasures, and the abioity to match the spectral output to ambient atmospheric conditions or known target characteristics.

Rewritable multi-layered optical storage media promise to increase removable disk computer peripheral storage capacity by two orders of magnitude. Two-photon excitation of photosensitive molecules at the focus of a high numerical aperture laser beam provides unparalleled optical sectioning (axial resolution), allowing stacking of up to 100 data layers within a single unified composite disk. Several background suppresion methods may be used for reading: either confocal detection of two-photon fluorescence excitation for fluorescent photochromic media; differential interference contrast detection (DIC) for phase recorded media. We have already achieved \"write-once, read-many\" (WORM) media at densities of > 10 12power bits/cm3 in 30-layer photopolymer phase recorded structures. Here we propose to extend this work with the development of erasable or \"rewritable\" media. During Phase I, several proposed photochemistries including: bacteriorhodopsin, polyester with azo-dye side groups, and fluorescent photochromic media will be evaluated in terms of relative stability, cyclicity, toxicity, cost and signal throughput. Promising candidate materials will be incorporated within a multi-layered medium sample. Multi-layered recording, reading, erasure and re-writing will then be experimentally demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "A research and development program is proposed for developing and implementing a low temperature, highly anisotropic, reliable, environmentally benign reactive ion etching (RIE) for complex-oxide films. The RIE Process will be optimized such that it is highly selective (e.g., >5), with high etch rates (e.g., >50 nm/min) and there i minimal or no damage to underlying layers. Furthermore, effort will be focused on preserving film stoichiometry at the widewalls. Two different approaches will be pursued to achieve the goals of this project. The first approach is based on the use of etch gases which have very low values of ozone depletion potential (ODP) and global warming potential (GWP). Three potential etch gases have been identified, and preliminary studies using one of them resulted in very encouraging results. The second approach is very novel and based on a very broad and a new concept, which we call \"Etching by Inverse MOCVD.\" The concept is simple in that, etching is performed by in-situ formation of metalorganic precursors by plasma/ion induced chemical reactions between the film to be etched and appropriate organic compounds. Inducing the reactions by plasma/ions is mandatory for anisotropic etching requirements. We have shown the proof of this concept (e.g., high selectivity and reasonable etch rates) for ferroelectrics, high T superconducitng oxides, and metlas. For the proposed project, our preliminary studies will be expanded for developing an optimized etch process which can be easily transferred to companies like Motorola for incorporating in their ferroelectric device processing schemes.

UP TO NOW, NIOBIUM TIN (NB3SN) IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PRACTICAL SUPERCONDUCTOR FOR HIGH-FIELD APPLICATIONS.  ONE OF THE EFFECTIVE APPROACHES TO RAISE THE CRITICAL CURRENT DENSITIES OF NB3SN IN HIGH MAGNETIC FIELDS IS TO ALLOY NB3SN WITH TITANIUM (TI) OR TANTALUM (TA).  THE CURRENT PRACTICE OF ADDING TI INTO NB3SN IS TO USE NBTI ALLOY RODS AND/OR COOPER (CU) BRONZE MATRIX ALLOYED WITH TI TO ASSEMBLE THE MONOCORE BILLETS. NEVERTHELESS, THE PROCESSING OF THESE CONDUCTORS OFTEN SUFFERS FROM DRAWABILITY PROBLEMS DUE TO ENHANCED WORK HARDENING.  PHASE I WILL INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING A TERNARY (NB,TI)3SN/CU MULTIFILAMENTARY SUPERCONDUCTING WIRE WITH NB/TI COMPOSITE FILAMENTS PREPARED FROM PURE NB AND TI SHEETS USING A JELLY-ROLL TECHNIQUE.

IT IS EXPECTED THAT USE OF NB/TI COMPOSITE FILAMENTS VIA A JELLY ROLL TECHNIQUE WILL IMPROVE THE FABRICABILITY OF THE (NB,TI)3SN/CU SUPERCONDUCTING WIRE AND CUT THE COST.  THE FINE GRAIN STRUCTURE IN NB AND TI SHEETS WILL ALSO HELP TO ENHANCE THE CRITICAL CURRENT (JC) IN LOW AND INTERMEDIATE MAGNETIC FIELDS, AND REDUCE THE FILAMENT SAUSAGING AT THE SAME TIME.  IN PHASE I, TWO TERNARY (NB,TI)3SN/CU SUPERCONDUCTING WIRES, ONE CONTAINING NB/TI COMPOSITE FILAMENTS AND THE OTHER CONTAINING CONVENTIONAL NB/1-2WT.%TI ALLOY FILAMENTS, WILL BE FABRICATED USING A CONVENTIONAL BRONZE-ROUTE PROCESS.

The primary goals of this proposal are to design and demonstrate a continuously tunable phase shifter with built-in dc bias and to determine the feasibility of using it in a phased array antenna system. SCT and TRW have teamed to design, fabricate and test a prototype HTS/ferroelectric phase shifter. We will then use the results of this demonstration and an antenna systems study to design a relatively simple four element phased array antenna which uses this phase shifter technology and determine the feasibility of producing the antenna. This antenna will be developed in Phase II of this project. The federal government, and in particular the Department of Defense, along with the private sector communications industry, use phased array antenna technology for many applications. These users will benefit from the development of a less complex, and therefore lower cost, technology for high performance phased array antenna systems that provides orders of magnitude performance improvement due to the use of extremely lom loss superconducting materials.",

        "abstract": "The long term objective of this project is to develop high-performance magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) receivers to enable novel, low-cost MRI machine designs. The key components of these coils are high-temperature superconducting (HTS) thin films and cryogenic amplifiers. One design for a novel low-cost MRI machine is pre-polarized MRI (PMRI), which is currently under development at several research laboratories. In PMRI, the sample is subjected to a high-field polarizing pulse, followed by an ultra-low field pulse during collection of the image data. Due to the reduced costs of capital equipment, siting and service, PMRI machines are expected to provide clinically useful images for as little as one-tenth the cost of present-day commercial MRI machines. The key component still required to make PMRI a feasible technology is an ultra-low loss RF receiver. Present-day MRI receiver technology is inadequate for the low-noise requirements of PMRI. For the Phase I effort, we propose to make and test a prototype of an HTS coil that will be suitable for PMRI as well as other kinds of ultra-low field imaging. Anticipated Benefits: Success in this research effort will enable commercial development of PMRI machines and other forms of ultra-low field imaging. These machines are expected to gain a significant share of the U.S. medical imaging market, as the health reform movement is placing an increasing emphasis on cost-effective diagnostics.",

The constraints imposed by the epitaxial, single crystal growth of superconducting thin films, while minimizing interdiffusion, has hindered application development. Thus, the film performance is invariable limited by the substrate in the case of microwaves, or the dielectric in the case of multi-layers. The program proposed represents a revolutionary departure from the traditional epitaxial multi-layer growth. In Phase I, we will develop a technique to detach a YBCO film from its growth substrate using novel lift-off procedures. Phase I will also study lamination of these YBCO films to low e substrates using organic polymers. The HTS/low e/HTS layer structure is the enabling technology for many different applications including multi-chip modules, interconnects and high frequency microwaves. Anticipated Benefits: The innovation is a generic and revolutionary enabling technology for high Tc electronic devices. If successful, it will result in a much improved process for device fabrication allowing optimizing structures to be made for the first time from large area films. These advances will find application in : general sensor elements such as antennas and pickup coils (for example in MRI), multi-chip modules, microwave components and integrated semiconductor/superconductor devices.",

The SPI technique utilizes the changing interference effects in the surface layer to measure water temperature and layer thickness resolution of 0.5 nm are amongst the best known of any techniques. We will demonstrate that data acquired from the measurements can be used for feedback control of the processes.

ONE OF THE CURRENT TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED, BUT AN IMPORTANT GOAL FOR  CA(2+) I RATIO IMAGING IS THE ABILITY TO PERFORM REAL-TIME IMAGING (I.E., VIDEO FRAME RATES OF 30 FRAMES PER SECOND).  WHEN USING FURA-2, THE ABILITY TO FOLLOW FAST CHANGES IN  CA(2+) I CAN BE LIMITED BY THE RATE AT WHICH THE EXCITATION WAVELENGTHS ARE CHOPPED.  IF RATIOING IS TO BE DONE IN REAL TIME, THE REQUIREMENT IS THAT THE EXCITATION WAVELENGTH BE SWITCHED WITHIN THE VERTICAL BLANKING PERIOD OF A VIDEO SIGNAL (1200 MUS).  THE INTENT OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A HIGH SPEED UV-WAVELENGTH SWITCHING (EXCITATION) SYSTEM FOR REAL TIME OPTICAL IMAGING OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.

They cite preliminary data from theirexperience in which 3 ml of plasma can be isolated from 10 ml of whole blood by filtration throughpolysulfoam filters in a 3 minute period. They state that plasma obtained by that method isindistinguishable from that prepared by centrifugation when analyzed for hemolysis, glucose, BUN CO2and total protein. They emphasizes that the system they are utilizing is a completely closed filtrationsystem which should avoid contamination with microorganisms. They state that other filtration deviceshave been developed at SymBiotech which can extract drugs from plasma, serum and whole blood withabout 90% efficiency using only 50 to 100 microliters of serum and less than 50 microliters of organicsolvent. In Phase I of this application, they plan initially to determine the best MPHF material anddimensions for separating glycerine from the red blood cell fraction without inducing hemolysis.Subsequently, they plan to determine optimal blood flow rates through their system such that maximalglycerine can be removed from the blood cell suspension without inducing hemolysis. Then using thisinformation, they will design and build a MPHF based blood reconstitution system consistent with thematerial and fluid mechanics determined in their initial studies.

Individual tasks such as fault diagnosis and configuration management have been automated successfully. However, less progress has been made in coordinating sybsystem- and task-specific intelligent applications to work together cooperatively to achieve coherent system-level management. The proposed SBIR effort will investigate an innovative agent- oriented architecture to address this problem. The primary objective will be to design a generic infrastructure, which consists of a layered collection of distributed communication and coordination services. The second objective will be to design a uniform, high-level Application Programming Interface (API) to the infrastructure. Agents will interact with one another via API requests to the infrastructure. This approach greatly reduces the complexity of designing agents by externalizing communication and control functionality into an integrated framework of common, interoperable services. Maintainability and extensibility are correspondingly simplified. The resulting technology will enable NASA to design and prototype, implement, deploy, and operate highly automated ground control networks for space-based systems.",

The quality of the delivered software product as well as its cost is determined largely by the effectiveness of the software test process. A possible new method of software testing based on a new software paradigm that was evolved by Professor Manuel Blum. These developments are founded on a probablistic, interactive proof which relies on randomness and the interplay between a prover and a checker to achieve a practically unassailable proof of correctness. This software testing technique has been proven in a non-real-time environment, but needs to be extended to complex real-time avionics software.

One unique aspect of the PIN is the ability to totally simulate its activities on a standard PC or Macintosh without access to the actual hardware, allowing end-users to program the PIN and test experimental regimes. The closure and multiple levels of containment reduce safety concerns during spaceflight and open terrestrial uses requiring containment where hazardous agents are to be studied. Cleanup and refurbishment are easily achieved with no risk to the PIN operator.",

Data re passive objects to be manipulated by the user. There are not \"intelligent agents\" running as background processes that provide assistance to the user in navigating the maze of data and that do his/her bidding. Perhaps most unfortunate, there is little use made of data graphs since data graphics and animations of data graphics are powerful media for conveying extensive, multidimensional data sets at a low cognitive cost to the operator. Virtual Reality (VR) and data visualization are related, emerging technologies that promise to radically alter the operator-machine interface (OMI). The proposed effort will result in the definition of a system architecture and the selection/definition of key hardware and software technologies for a Battle Group Tactical Decision Aid (BG/TDA) for the Navy's Copernicus C4I architectural approach; the development will focus on the OMI. The real-time, distributed system architecture for the BF/TDA will integrate exisitng and emergent virtual reality, data visualization, and object-oriented data base technologies and will provide a solid basis for developing and deploying the next generation of C4I decision aids.

        "abstract": "A Phase I study is proposed to investigate the feasibility of applying a novel ray-tracing technique for electromagnetic propagation through the dense, refractive media of the earth's upper surface. Application of the technique to modern radar and navigation technology should result in the ability to conduct airborne surveillance of subsurface targets with three dimensional spatial resolution of less than a meter. The primary project objective is to develop a high-resolution, airborne ground-penetration radar (GPR) system concept incorporating three-dimensional synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging techniques; wideband waveforms; and Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation. The work effort will (1) evaluate the refractive-media ray-tracing technique; (2) produce preliminary refractive- SAR (RSAR) architecture that merges time- and frequency-domain information to fill three-dimensional grid cells; (3) define a wideband, low-frequency (100 dB) radar receiver for GPR applications; and (4) collect a sample set for chirped-waveform radar data in a refractive medium to validate the RSAR concept. From a military perspective, this radar technique has the potential to produce subterranean images applicable to defense-related surveillance of mine fields, buried assets, bunkers, and tunnels. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - Ariticipat I Defense applications include detection of near-surface mines, detection and identification of buried assets, tunnel and bunker imaging, and civil engineering aspects of military logistics. Commercial applications include mineral prospecting; water percolation surveys; EPA-required waste site monitoring; subsurface pollution investigations; mapping of buried pipelines; surveys of conductivity, thermal, porosity, and moisture content; FEMA-related emergency response for large-scale flood-monitoring.",

These sensors will be designed for the very high resolution required for precise control of local mirror shapes, segment location, and edge detection. The technology proposed uses a laser diode emitter/optics and position-sensing photodetector/optics receiver to achieve a non-contact absolute distance displacement sensor. The proposers manufacture displacement sensors based on this general technology already, but the size and cost preclude large quantity application to adaptive optics instruments. By using miniature replicated optics, small laser diodes, and the now available miniature position-sensing photodetectors, a hybrid sensor will be developed which can provide resolution to 1nm (0.04microinch) and accuracy of lOnm. The inherent high electrical bandwidth allows real time atmospheric turbulence correction in closed loop control systems. Objectives, effort, and results: A detailed prototype design is planned. Specifically, we will fabricate a demonstration model which measures +lOO micrometers displacement. Phase I addresses the sensor head and the linearization of its analog output.

        "abstract": "The notch filter is essentially an inverse dynamic compensator. It has great performance when the aircraft's structural modes are nearly identical to the models of the structural modes which were used to design the notch filter. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons it is very difficult to precisely predict the structural dynamics of the aircraft. Often the uncertainty in the ability to predict the structural dynamics is handled by designing a filter with a wider notch that can accommodate expected variations in the structural modal frequencies. The downside to this solution is that unwanted phase shift is introduced at the frequencies where the pilot is providing closed loop control. The result is pilot induced oscillation. An adaptive notch filter offers the potential of tuning each filters so that it can provide the necessary structural mode suppression while minimizing the introduced phased shift. A neural network based parameter identification technique is proposed as a means to solve, on-line, for the parameters of a state space model that contains both rigid body and structural degrees of freedom. The identified state model then will provide the data base for updating the characteristics of the notch filter.",

This plan has been based on an examination of the state-of-the-art as it is currently evolving in operations such as Bosnia. This information has been used to identify needs and requirements to be addressed with advanced delivery concepts. A driving consideration is higher aerodynamic efficiency (higher L/D). This in turn indicates increased aspect ratio and reduced drag. These motivate increased structural stiffness and better integration of the load with the aerodynamic structure. The range of existing alternate concepts, including flexible wings and unique rotary wing designs, are surveyed to identify potential approaches. Several proprietary STI-developed concepts are presented which demonstrate the significant potential for improved performance, treatment of specific limitations of existing concepts, and the proposed development approach. It is demonstrated that improved air drop precision will cause aerodynamic stability and control, coupled with onboard navigation and guidance system requirements, to become major design drivers. The approach to the overall project emphasizes a design process based on mission-oriented requirements incorporated into an operational model of airdrop missions. Greater mission-dependent variation in confirgurations, driven by factors such as the spectrum of payload unit size, is anticipated as overall system performance is improved.",

        "abstract": "There is a need to rapidly identify biological and chemical contaminants in regenerated air and water in extraterrestrial environments. Conventional sensors all fail this application because of deficiencies in several areas, including size, weight, versatility, power requirements, specificity, response time, and accuracy. Small. in situ, continuously operating, optical sensors can provide accurate, rapid, multiparameter detection. We propose to demonstrate the fundamental technology for a new type of in situ, multiparameter diagnostic sensor which uses optical microassembly to implement a spatial matrix. This is an innovative sensor system because of its ability to measure a variety of physical and chemical parameters by using one small matrix on a transparent substrate. A micro-optical array with input optical fibers directs several light sources to various cells of the matrix. Spectral changes to the input light. including absorption and fluorescence, are detected by a photodiode array. Selection of the transducer in each of the matrix regions will enable measurement of temperature, mass flow rates, pH, and chemical concentrations in gaseous or liquid media. Immunoassay techniques in some matrix cells provide extremely high degrees of selectivity and sensitivity for specific biological agents. Use of micro-optic assembly techniques will yield a small, rugged sensor design.",

        "abstract": "We propose to use epitaxial liftoff techology and patterned overlays to develop new approaches to multichip module fabrication and testing that will facilitate in process testing and improve thermal management of dense multichip modules (MCMs). Thin, single-crystal semiconductor films can be produced with epitaxial liftoff technology. The films can be used to improve several features of MCMs and improve the manufacturing process. Some potential advantages are improved thermal management, higher density packaging, inprocess testing and repair, application to optoelectronic devices, and flexible or nonplanar packages. Patterned overlays can be used with epitaxial films to provide mechanical support, electrical interconnection and interim testing as the MCM is assembled. In this program, we will combine these two technologies to develop a process which maintains the advantage of each separate technology and facilitate inprocess testing and repair of multichip modules. During Phase I we will perform feasibility experiments to demonstrate the enabling technology, and will design a demonstration MCM to be fabricated in Phase II. Anticipated Benefits: This development will allow increased density of electronic integration by improving thermal dissipation and lead to improved inprocess testing of multichip electronic and optoelectronic devices. It will also develop the ability to package and interconnect semiconductor electronics and optoelectronics in flexible, nonplanar, or even pakcages of stacked integrated circuits.",

The final operational system will be designed to meet the CALS criteria for AUTOMATED, PAPERLESS and REAL-TIME inforamtion support. The working elements of this system capability will consist of COTS (Commercial off the shelf) hardware, software and electronic libraries, thus avoiding costly proprietary development and maintenance costs. All of the data and information tools described in this project can be centralized and networked Navy wide. The collective capability will provide REAL-TIME information tools that search, analyze and monitor component selection, usage and support. The application goal is to automate obsolescence management at component level. The infrastructure of information support will be transparent and adaptable to other component commodities. the investigation strategy utilized by this project will incorporate a vertical and horizontal assessment of Navy requirements. The vertical assessment will include surveying all of the facets of parts management for a major weapn system, e.g., F/A-18 maintenance, repair, operational, design/modernization and long-term support. The horizontal portion of the survey will include the analysis and assessment of Navy requirements at the Command level, e.g., NAC, NUWES, NSWC, NAVAIR, etc.. Based on the multiple facets of need within a large program and the different types of need at different Commands, TACTech will reconfigure a COTS system to meet the specific requirements for the various Navy Commands.",

In order to provide a responsive system, an easily transportable system capable of operating in a variety of conditions must be available without an extensive development cycle. Equipment must fit in standard shelters/vehicles used by lower echelon forces and must be capable of supporting a satisfactory output rate within limited tactical timelines. The complexity of the system must allow operations by large numbers of personnel with minimal training and skills. Cost is a factor in today's fiscal environment if sufficient numbers of systems are to be provided to the maximum numbers of forces requiring support.

        "abstract": "Development is proposed for a breakthrough technique involving the use of electro-magnetic radiation to detect and measure thickness of non-conductive coatings on both metallic and non-metallic surfaces. The primary objective of the Phase I effort will be to prove that this approach can detect all forms of ice on aircraft structures and roadway surfaces. This system would permit detection and measurement under the various metrological conditions which produce icing and is further capable of detecting ice which is covered or co-mingled with snow, sleet, or rain. Mathematical analysis and recent experimentation indicates that the proposed technique will far exceed the capabilities of existing detection methods, as well as those known to be under development. Applicable to both military and commercial aircraft, this proprietary approach would also operate with newer aircraft having structures made of composite materials. Accurately determining when and how much de/anti-icing fluid is needed would offer significant cost savings and decrease environmental impact. The ability of this technique to precisely meausre the thickness of a non-conducting material could be used in many process control applications, as well as painting and bonding operations. Possibly dangerous surface corrosion could also be detected. Anticipated Benefits: Improved air and highway transporation safety, reduced environmental pollution and significant potential for economic savings. Broad application in the manufacturing sector in the areas of quality and process control, related to coatings and thickness measurements.",

        "abstract": "Many companies and agencies are already involved in oil spill responses, in activities ranging from integrated cleanup planning to hands-on cleanup efforts. However, relatively little R&D has realistically addressed real-time on-site tactical support on cleanup operations by means of remote sensing airborne platforms. This effort identified the key role that a real-time map display plays in providing information on the oil thickness distribution as a basis for all subsequent oil spill recovery planning activities. In carrying out this effort, the oprational framework within which tactical mapping plays a key role is first outlined. This provides a basis for the analysis of a multi-sensor suite selection for UAVs and manned aircraft platforms. In this analysis, the need for a low cost approach is emphasized. An open architecture sensor suite conceptual design is proposed that is fully compatible with existing off-the-shelf hardware. The core architecture is based on real-time orthorectification and fusion of information from differing bands, leading to a realible geo-referenced \"picture\" of the oil thickness distribution. The Phase I core architecture is anticipated to be readily implementable in a Phase II effort, based on pervious work of a similar nature. Anticipated Benefits: This effort will result in a low-cost airborne system for oil spill detection and monitoring. The embedded sensor fusion technology can be used in a variety of hazardous materials detection applications, in emergency assessment services, and land use applications.",

This proposed effort is to identify a coating and coating application method that will complement the newly developed ceramic brush brush seal, as well as existing metallic brush seals. It is the intent of the proposed work to evaluate existing coatings, or minor variations therof, to fill the requirements of a low wear, high temperature brush seal shaft coating.

A number of screening tests are proposed for the candidate coatings. The tests include thermal shock, abrasive wear, sliding wear at representative temperatures/speeds and sliding friction tests. These tests will determine a candidate coating's ability to be applied to the ceramic brush seal system and achieve the stated objectives.

        "abstract": "A significant problem in precision manufacturing of large parts/assemblies is the requirement to make measurements over the surfacesof these parts for a variety of reasons including inspection/quality control; control of surfacing operations such as coatings, abrasive erosion, buffing, and texturing; and generation of \"as built\" documentation. A specific instance of this class of problem has been chosen; the exhause assembly for the engine on the F-22 aircraft. In this application the extent of the surface of concern is several square meters. A coating is being applied tothe surface, with a requirement to precisely control the coating thickness over the entire surface. Measurement precisions on the order of a fraction of a mil are required over the entire surface, with in-situ measurement being highly desirable so that the coating deposition process can be controlled to meet the coating thickness specifications. Current measurement technologies are inadequate to perform these measurements while the part is on the fixture, resulting in a very costly \"trial and error\" approach that must be addressed before the engine goes into production. One of the principal efforts of this proposal will apply the NGC concepts, OSAGE tools, and laser stripe measurement processes developed under previous reseach efforts, to this problem. The result of successful performance on this application will be a class of tools for precision measurement of extended, complex surfaces with a working prototype to be developed in Phase II, sufficiently general to be applied to a large number of manufacturing problems. Anticipated Benefits: As a result of this effort, significant cost savings will be realized by the US Air Force in the procurement of aircraft engines incorporating plasma-deposited coatings. The potential savings of this development alone is expected to be in the millions of dollars. The methods and tools to be developed have wide application in surface mapping measurements for military and commercial manufacturing.",

These excellent characteristics are mitigated by the use of high pressure vessels for hydrogen storage. Nickel/metal hydride batteries have same chemistry, except for storing the hydrogen as a metal hydride. Ni/M-H batteries are inherently safe and have an energy density of 55 Wh/kg and 178 Wh/L, two to three times that of Ni-Cd batteries. Present state of the art batteries utilize metal hydrides, containing 1-1.2 wt% hydrogen. Worldwide development efforts are in progress to develop nickel/metal hydride batteries. By developing reversible metal hydrides of > 2 wt% hydrogen and appropriate battery design and engineering, the energy density of this system can be enhanced to >100 Wh/kg and 300 Wh/L, making them suitable for many space station battery applications. The proposed Phase I program will (i) research novel metal hydride materials with >2 wt% hydrogen capacity, (ii) establish reversibility and stability and (ii) demonstrate at the cell level superior nickel/metal hydride battery characteristics. The Phase II program will involve design, development, fabrication, and testing of full-size battery configurations.",

        "abstract": "Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is a by-product generated in small amounts during the manufacture of chlorinated compounds used in herbicides, insecticides and wood preservatives. Waste that contains concentrations of TCDD above 1 part per billion (ppb) is federally regulated as acutely hazardous. Inappropriate use, spills, leaks and dumping of herbicides, insecticides and wood preservatives containing TCDD have resulted in dioxin contaminated soil at numerous sites across the country. Project managers of dioxin contaminated soil sites must select an appropriate remediation technique. One that completely dechlorinates the TCDD and associated contaminants is preferred over ones that simply immobilize the contaminants. Many treatment technologies have been developed to dechlorinate toxic chlorinated organics, however, very few have been demonstrated to dechlorinate extremely stable tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. TA&T proposes to perform a survey of existing and emerging techniques plus demonstrate at the bench scale a very promising technology that has been proven to effect complete dechlorination of dioxin contaminated wood, soil and liquid herbicide formulations. The technique, Base Catalyzed Decomposition, is very appealing for commercialization because it is a safe, rapid and inexpensive method of completely destroying many halogenated organic wastes found at DoD, DoE and EPA Superfund Sites across the country.",

Acceleration and strain data will be gathered for full, continuous sweep tests to monitor the steady state strain and acceleration conditions and determine a dynamic friction constant. Strain and acceleration data will also be gathered to monitor the force required to initiate movement (static friction force) from a variety of angles throughout the sweep regime. Additional processing will be applied to the data, including the fast fourier transform (FFT), calculation of the kurtosis (measure of impulsiveness), and calculation of jerk (derivative of acceleration) as quantitative measures of wing bearing wear. IMADS (Integrated Monitoring Analysis and Diagnostic System), developed by Technology Integration, will perform the data analysis, as well as determining peak strain and acceleration levels, root-mean-square (RMS) levels, bandpass filtering, and other statistical measurements.",

Two signal processing strategies will be employed: traditional measurement of the signal characteristics, and a neural net analysis of the signal. The processing will indicate the onset, and severity, of the pump failure.

Both techniques--Coherent Frequency Hopping (CFH) and Coherent Agile Sideband Defense (CASCADE)--attempt to avoid the ARM bandwidth by use of extensive pulse-to-pulse frequency agility, but their mechanizations differ. In its high-resolution implementation, CFH is a spread spectrum technique that is primarily applicable to radar modes that have small-to-moderate angle/range/doppler processing volumes (e.g., acquisition, track, raid assessment), while in its low-resolution implementation, it is applicable to all AIPD modes, but requires at least three receive channels to be effective. CASCADE is an innovative double-sided suppressed carrier (DS-SC) technique that is believed to be applicable to all radar modes. Phase I study tasks consist of assessing current and postulated future ARM parameters, developing the two frequency agility counter-ARM techniques, and analyzing their performance and feasibility. In the process of investigating the two techniques, their performance with linear, nonlinear, and random frequency hopping will be evaluated analytically. A plan to test these techniques during Phase II will be developed during Phase I.",

However, there is currently no method available relating the effectiveness of the simulator/device to any cost savings to the government. Current models require an exhaustive task analysis and are not able to assess cost-effectiveness at concept formulation, due to the lack of detailed system information. This project describes the development of a methodology to assess the cost effectiveness of device/simulators as surrogates for the actual weapon system at concept formulation. The objective of the phase I effort is to develop a methodology and model framework that will allow simulator costs and training effectiveness to be estimated at concept formulation. In addition, this framework will allow estimation of the effectiveness and cost of training on actual equipment ( an area that has largely been ignored in the past); A number of cost and effectiveness models will be developed. These models will be useful to other research outside the scope of this effort.",

        "abstract": "In order to keep Naval aviation forces maintained and ready to perform all assigned missions, repairs to the systems and equipment are required. In the current era of downsizing the military forces and facilities, it is important to have high-confidence estimates of the resources (money, time, and people) required to operte and maintain equipment and systems before embarking on larger, non-routine repairs and modifications. Funding for the repairs and modifications is provided by the system or equipment program managers. Their budgets are undergoing increasing scrutiny and are being reduced if the amounts are not well justified. An improved method estimating the cost of these modifications and repairs is possible through a database with an intelligent query system. Naval Air Systems Command has a requirement to systematically collect and use historical data to develop parametric cost estimates for repairs and modifications to be performed at or by Naval Aviation Depots and other facilities. When a requirement for repairs or modifications is identified, planners and estimators at the repair facilities do not have the data in an appropriate format or database to efficiently make high-confidence estimates of the resources required to perform the work. The Aircraft Repair and Modification Cost Estimating (ARAMCE) system eliminates this problem and provides realistic cost estimating to NAVAIR facilities.",

Engine thrust, one of the more important engine parameters, is not currently measured, but is estimated from various sensor readings, such as EPR (Engine Pressure Ratio), spool speed, fuel flow, and turbine inlet temperatures. This project will demonstrate the advantages of using a system that computes net thrust by measuring gas flow in the engine exhaust and exhaust sections to calculate net thrust. The thrust will be presented on a unique color pictorial display, the Engine Control and Management System (E-MACS) developed by NASA. Real-time thrust gives the pilot an instant snapshot of engine health, improving reaction time during critical flight regimes such as take-off and landing.

THE KEY OBJECTIVE IS TO ELIMINATE FALSE ALARMS WHILE PROVIDING POSITIVE DETERMINATION WHEN A HUMAN IS PRESENT.  THE PROPOSED EFFORT ELIMINATES FALSE ALARMS BY COMBINING MULTIPLE SENSORS, VIDEO, AND THERMAL SIGNATURE USING A PATENTED IMAGING TECHNOLOGY CALLED OMNIVIEW, COUPLED WITH CUSTOM IMAGING ANALYSIS, TO MAKE A POSITIVE DETERMINATION.

Compounds will be assayed ina cell culture assay to evaluate the effectiveness of such agents compared to either of the componentsindividually or co-administered,to determine if synergistic activity against cell proliferation is achieved.In principle, we envisage the antisense oligonucleotide hybridizing with RNA in a smooth muscle cell andpermitting the attached mitomycin C to covalently modify an adjacent guanine base, thereby preventingtranscription of the target gene, and preventing cell cycling. Such permanent modification may beanticipated to be more effective than oligonucleotide hybridization alone, while operating at a sub-toxicdose of mitomycin C.

Aircraft weighing less than 15 kg can now carry avionics and fuel sufficient for missions of several thousand kilometres and several days duration, at altitudes from sea level to perhaps as high as 15 km. Their payload, while small, is sufficient for many applications in earth and atmospheric science, and their low cost should stimulate use on a wide scale. We first proposed these \"aerosondes\" in 1991, to satisft long-standing requirements for in situ weather data over remote and oceanic regions of the globe. Engineering development began in 1992, and three prototype aircraft have since been built. Here we propose to complete development and flight testing of the third prototype, including demonstration of long-endurance capability. In Phase II an initial operational aircraft will be designed and teken into long-range field trials.",

Since performance, stability, and chamber wall heat flux are strongly dependent upon injector flow characteristics, this will provide a means to rapidly and readily vary these parameters either during development tests, between tests, and perhaps even in flight hardware. By appropriately adjusting these flow modifying devices it will be possible to provide the highest performance while still maintaining a satisfactory stability margin. This will greatly reduce the cost of engine development and improve performance. The objective of this effort is to determine the feasibility of this new approach. This Phase I program will assess the various means proposed herein to modify injector flow and, if appropriate, prepare for testing of the most promising. If successful, this new approach should find application in nearly every new liquid rocket injector development program and perhaps every injector. This concept could also find application in hybrid rockets where it could be used to quickly vary injector flows to maximize performance as the solid propellant is burnt away.",

        "abstract": "Refrigeration and cooling systems for mocing vehicles are usually powered by internal combustion engines which convert two-thirds of the fuel energy into waste heat. The recovery and efficient utilization of this waste heat is hindered by its low temperature which is sufficient only for energizing sorption cycles. In addition to having low overall efficiency, liquid sorption systems are difficult or impossible to operate in a moving vehicle. The solid/gas absoption system utilizing zeolites has te unique capability of converting small variations in temperature into large variations in pressure which permits waste heat conversion to cooling by small and efficient devices. Combining the zeolite technology with the principle of energy regeneration results in high conversion efficiencies and an overall increase of the coefficient of performance (COP) to 1.0 or more. This technology has been proven in our successful development of residentail heat pumps and solar refrigerators. It is environmentally benign since it reduces CO2 emissions and does not use any ozonedepleting CFCs or HCFCs. We propose to investigate the applicability of the regenerative zeolite absorption technology to the colling and refrigernation needs of energy efficient vehicles. For this purpose we will construct and test a small-scale prototype and evaluate its performance and operating efficiency when energized by waste heat. As a refrigerant we will consider both water and alcohols in order to cover evaporator temperatures from OoF to 45oF and to satisfy cooling needs ranging from air conditions to deep freezing. Anticipated Benefits: The potential benefits to the military range from cooling for tanks and other vehicles to frontline medical refrigeration for blood supplies and serums. Commercial applications include air conditioning needs of buses, passenger trains and automobiles, refrigerated transportation of perishables and, when combined with a solar collector, cooling at remote sites where electricity is not available.",

This significantly reduces the radiator mass, by eliminating the need for a wick in the adiabatic and condenser sections of the loop heat pipe. Loop heat pipes can also withstand a greater gravitational head during ground testing. A limitation for heat pipes on earth and in space is the heat transport capability under the influence of an opposing acceleration: gravitational acceleration on earth, and an induced acceleration resulting from spacecraft maneuvers on-orbit. In some cases, the heat pipe system must be operated on earth gravity-aided (evaporator down).

Use of this air decreases the net thrust or shaft horsepower, and increases the fuel consumption.

Engine cycle analyses predict an increase in shaft horsepower of up to 5% combined with a 5% fuel reduction for an IHPTET Phase II turboshaft engine at 20% Maximum Continuous Power (MCP). Loop pipes are similar to heat pipes, however, loop pipes are self-priming during start-up, significantly increasing reliability. In addition, loop pipes are more easily designed to operate in the turbine engine environment, with its high maneuvering accelerations. Loop heat pipes have already been fabricated with power and gravitational heads that are similar to the anti-icing requirements.

        "abstract": "This study will develop a new anti-thrombotic drugs for the treatment of thromboembolicdisorders. In pilot studies, a coagulation inhibitor has been identified in an aqueous extract of Anodontiawoodiana. Early chromatographic and spectral data suggest that the active principle(s) may be a smallpeptide with a molecular weight range between 2,000-4,000 Daltons. Active fractions from thispreparation block thrombin activity and can also prolong the prothrombin and thrombin timemeasurements. This application will obtain support to further purify the active component(s) of theaqueous extract. Its physical, chemical and biological activities will then be evaluated with an eventualgoal of elucidation of the mode of action of this new compound. In the Phase I study, totalcharacterization of the active component of the extract is anticipated and this will be followed by PhaseII development of the antithrombotic principle with eventual entry into clinical research. The majorinterest in Thrombo Diagnostic is to develop remedies from herbs and animal sources which haveminimal side effects. Such compounds have been used in China for more than a thousand years. Thereis an extract from clam (A. woodiana) which has been used in China for thrombotic disorders. Clamshells are ground and extracted in acetic acid in the cold for 2 hours. After filtration, centrifugation anddialysis of the supernatant, a compound is obtained which prolongs the activated partial thromboplastintime (66 seconds as compared to a control of 26-30 seconds) (at a concentration of 50 ug/ml). Ionexchange chromatography, starting with QAE-Sephadex has been carried out and an active fractioneluted in the first peak. Further purification was done on a mono-Q column with FPLC. A UV spectrumshows a single or several related peptides. The fraction is trypsin-sensitive, but pepsin insensitive. Inaddition to activity in coagulation tests as mentioned, the compound inhibits alpha-thrombin. Thus, themajor fraction may be a thrombin inhibitor. The compound is different from Hirudin and may representa new class antithrombin-type anticoagulants. It is not thought to be a degradation product of anotherlarger protein. In this Phase I application, a larger number of separation techniques will be used to purifythe compound to homogeneity. This will involve additional types of chromatography which shouldresolve the material into a single component. The active fraction contains mostly polar molecules whichare hydrophobic and is already quite pure. Thus, further chromatography may resolve the components.Structural studies are also anticipated, including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Dr. AlfredWeinheimer, a medicinal chemist who is Chairman of the College of Pharmacy at the University ofHouston will act as a consultant as will Dr. Kenneth K. Wu, who is a world authority in the coagulationfield. Questions to be asked include whether the compound binds to a site on thrombin which is similarto hirudin or to AT-III. Tests will also be carried out to learn whether the compound blocks activatedfactor X. If the final product contains more than one compound, these may have distinct anticoagulantproperties. On the other hand, a single component may have multiple inhibitory properties. Specificcoagulation factor assays will be carried out to determine the above mentioned details.",

Despite intense research to neutralize it action, there are still no viable technologies for preventing human exposure. Its delayed action causes servere edema, ulceration, and necrosis of the skin and mucous membrane of the respiratory tract plus permanent eye damage. Methodology exist for its neutralization using chemical oxidants such as hypochlorite bleach (OC1-) or chloramine-T (1). However, these agents are unsuitable for use with humans. We recently discovered that an extracellular enzymes, produced by an edible fungus, is capable of degrading MG.

        "abstract": "Pseudomorphic InGaAs with high InAs concentrations on GaAs substrates are currently in use in complementary-heterostructure FET (C-HFET) digital and MODFET MMW circuits. While their bandgaps enable them to detect 1300 and 1550 nm light, the projected detection efficiency (responsivity) is very low due to the limited thicknesses sampled by normally incident light. This proposal is to study the feasibility of building efficient long wavelength detectors on SI GaAs substrates by using laterally incident light, guided through an underlying waveguide, with leaky or resonant modes interacting with the thin InGaAs near the surface. With appropriate design, the InGaAs can be made to function both as the FET active layer, and, the optical detection layer, with the FET gate metals used in Schottky photodetectors. Success would enable 1300 and 1550 nm fiber technologies to be available for digital optical interconnects and phased array antenna remoting, while fully leveraging integrated GaAs digital and MMW ICs. Phase I will build simple device structures to compare responsivities for lateral (guided) incidence against vertical (unguided) incidence. Phase II will build the full up receiver and demonstrate it in a suitable test bed.",

        "abstract": "A promising new approach for high power solid-state sources will be demonstrated using spatial power combining grids. Present development of high power field effect transistor (FET) based solid-state sources at millimeter-wave frequencies is hampered by the limited power output of individual sources and the costs and power losses associated with combining a large number of sources using conventional approaches. However, the solid-state source offers the advantages of improved performance compared to vacuum tube power sources. Improved efficiency and reliability of millimeter-wave power sources is crucial to future generations of radar, communications, and sensing systems especially those operating in a space based environment. The proposed approach will use power combining arrays of FET based power generators. This method allows low loss combining ofa large number of FET sources at low cost by using monolithic integration. Critical elements addressed in the proposed program are impedence matching of devices for maximum power output and thermal analysis of heat sinking provided by various packaging approaches. Frequencies of 35, 60, and 94 GHz will be considered. At completion of Phase I, an initial array design and package design capable of generating 5-10 Watts at millimeter-wave frequencies will be developed. Anticipated Benefits: Benefits include low cost, high reliability, highly efficient millimeter-wave power sources for use in various wireless communications, radar, and meteorological sensing. Potential commerical applicatoins include high data rate communications and vision systems for \"seeing\" through smoke and fog.",

A critical issue has arisen in the development of the future W-band electronic systems technology: while InP-based materials and transistors are known to be the highest performance technology for W-band small signal and low-noise applications, they have not been able to be made commercially because InP material growth is at an embryonic stage of development and established sources of large diameter InP wafers are not yet available. Furthermore in power applications InP-based devices and circuits are limited by some key materials deficiencies. In particular, the \"Kink effect\", incomplete HFET pinch off at high drain voltages and low HFET breakdown.

Ibogaine obtained from the plantTabernanthe iboga promotes in humans a state of \"wakefulness and self-consciousness\". At present,there is little information available on the levels of ibogaine in body fluids or on the identification of majorand/or minor metabolites. Information on the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of ibogaine is necessaryfor understanding the biological effects of the drug. We will develop and validate an analytical methodfor the identification and quantitation of ibogaine and metabolite(s) in biological specimens. Analyticalmethod development for ibogaine and metabolites will be performed under a cooperative agreement withthe University of Miami School of Medicine and the Metro-Dade County Medical Examiner Department.Significant progress has been made on the development of a simple, reliable and precise analyticalmethod using quantitative gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Ibogaine has beenmeasured and a single principle metabolite has been identified in urine samples from dosed primates andhuman subjects. We will further improve upon, define and validate the analytical method. Theanalytical method will be applied to the actual assay of whole blood/plasma and urine samples providedto the project from an FDA approved Phase I pharmacokinetic trial of ibogaine currently ongoing at theUniversity of Miami School of Medicine. The proposed partnership between small business, localgovernment and academic scientists will promote the rapid development of a clinical laboratory drugtesting procedure for ibogaine.",

        "abstract": "ARPA requires a software template of a tank weapon system that facilitates model creation and effectiveness assessment of proposed new subsystems incorporating new technology. The template must meet five requirements: incorporate a representation of all tank subsystems; permit each subsystem representation to have multiple levels of detail and fidelity; be modular, whereby various alternative designs of a given subsystem may be easily (without recoding of the template) plugged in to the model; accommodate the MlAl and MlA2 tanks and possess a growth path to representing aircraft-based weapon systems; and be executable at a computer generated forces (CGF) workstation participating in a distributed interactive simulation (DIS). In Phase I we will decompose the tank weapon system into about 60 subsystems to demonstrate the existence of the template. We will assess whether the Combat Instruction Set (CIS) for crew behavior needs to be modified to operate with a modular CGF. We will assess whether the products of other ARPA programs may be used by this effort. In Phase 2 we will complete the template, modify the CIS if necessary, and implement the CGF in a workstation, and execute it within a DIS. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - This modular CGF could be used by ARPA, the Systems Command elements of the armed services, and major prime contractors. It enables rapid prototyping in software of proposed new designs. This enables evaluation of new technologies and subsystems, and enables tradeoffs between the elements of a subsystem specification. Phase 3 would develop a commercialized version of the software to be sold to major prime contractors.",

        "abstract": "A novel agile manufacturing system for production of fiber reinforced complex shape metal matrix composites (MMCs) is proposed. The composites are precision cast by pressurized infiltration casting. Thin-walled ceramic molds are used to contain and infiltrate complex-shaped preforms. A powerful, user-friendly 3D graphics software package is used to interactively create mold designs from the solid model of MMC component to be cast. The software can also analyze the casting process in transient 3D to simulate mold filling. A rapid prototyping method directly creates ceramic molds from the CAD-generated solid model, eliminating intervening steps and part-specific tooling. This increased flexibility allows for rapid design changes, dramatically reducing the cost and lead time involved in casting complex shape MMCs. Computer integrated manufacturing incorporating rapid prototyping will establish pressure infiltration casting as a new paradigm for affordable and timely manufacturing of near-net shape metal matrix composities and components. The proposed effort will domonstrate enabling technology by fabricating a fiber reinforced complex shape MMC component for the V-22 Osprey tilt rotor.",

IL-1, a centralmediator of inflammation responsible for initiating a host of immunologic events, is a logical target foranti-inflammatory therapies in IBD. Current drug therapies are directed at amelio-rating the effects ofIL-1. However, the therapies are not always effective and are associated with untoward side effects.Our long term objective is to develop an alternative therapy, oral formulations of recombinant adenoviralvectors containing the transgene for interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein (IL-1ra). This vector isbiologically active both in vitro and in vivo, and is capable of expressing therapeutic levels of IL-1ra.

We propose to demonstrate increased oproductivity through simplification at a healthcare provider's workstation through the principle called Interactive Self-Service. The tools required to demonstrate the benefits of a stream-lined clinical/adminstrative system are: a Smart (IC) Card, a workstation with a card reader/writer, and domain-specific software written to a standard based Healthcare Domain Model (HDM), built upon a consortium-led Healthcare Reference Architecture (HRA). We propose to demonstrate secure access and authentication systems to insure that privacy and confidentiality of patient data are protected. We will work closely with the Department of Defense' Offices of the Surgeons General, the National Healthcare Industry consoritum (NHIC), the Northern California Healthcare Technology Alliance (NCHTA) and the national Health Foundation's Health Data Interchange (HDI) project to integrate their developments as they occur. We will explore incentives to build provider acceptance of technology which supports administrative cooperation and improved quality. Anticipated Benefits: The creation of new, exportable, high-value products will be the major benefit of this proposed effort.

There has been an increasing demand for a high dielectric constant insulator for replacement of SiO. TiO(2) film is promising because it has a high dielectric constant with a sufficiently high breakdown voltage. In spite of continuous efforts for diamond and SiC film capacitor applications, it has been difficult to provide sufficient reliability toward LSI fabrication due to recrystallization of dielectric film which results in reduction of dielectric breakdown strength. Defect density of dielectric film significantly increases as thickness of the film is reduced to several hundred angstroms. Application of the ulta-thin capacitor to a switch-load resistor memory cell makes it possible to reduce the memory cell area to one-third that of a conventional memory cell. Techniques, such as thermal oxidation of titanium sputtering, and CVD, will be used to deposit TiO(2) thin film. The quality of the film, electrical properties such as breakdown voltage, dissipation factor, and equivalent series resistance will be evaluated. The prototypical ultra-thin TiO(2) capacitor will be demonstrated and life-tested.",

        "abstract": "Nickel/metal hydride (Ni/MH) batteries have received great attention recently in both government and private industry sectors. The most attractive characteristics of Ni/MH batteries are their much higher energy density over other types of batteries, such as lead-acid and nickel/cadmium, and the fact that they pose no hazardous waste disposal problem, as they do not contain toxic materials. However, this type of battery still remains in the R&D and small production stages. The major drawback to this battery type is that metal hydride electrodes suffer a cyclic volume change due to the absorption/desorption of hydrogen and the oxidation of hydrogen storage compounds exposed to electrolyte, which lead to the degradation of the electrodes. In this Phase I program, Ultramet proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating a novel metal hydride which will provide significant improvements over those currently used in Ni/MH batteries. This novel metal hydride has a greater hydrogen storage capacity, offering higher energy density; an extremely low volume change, some 30- 5096 less than current MH electrodes ; and excellent oxidation resistance, greatly minimizing the possibility of degradation. Ultramet will work closely with a leading expert in the field of metal hydrides to fabricate and characterize this novel metal hydride electrode for use in Ni/MH batteries.",

        "abstract": "In previous work, Ultramet has demonstrated an innovative variation of chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) in which two or more carbide coatings are applied in fine, alternating layers. The interfaces between these layers act as highly effective toughening mechanisms by inhibiting crack propagation. The first application involved the deposition of a layered HfC/SiC coating on carbon/carbon (C/C) and diboride matrix composites, which has been shown to provide oxidation resistance in the 1600-2500@C range. A second coating, which provided improved glass forming/crack sealing capability for cyclic use at lower temperatures, was developed based upon a layered Si3N4/SiC system. In this Phase I program, Ultramet proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of a highly innovative approach for the fabrication of tough, reliable carbon fiber/carbide matrix composite combustion chambers, in which a layered carbide matrix material will be applied to a carbon fiber preform by CVI. Current ceramic matrix composites, such as C/SiC, are limited by the fracture toughness of the SiC matrix, leading to exposure and degradation of the high-strength carbon fiber reinforcements, while SiC/SiC composites are limited by the maximum use temperature of the SiC fibers. The ability to maintain the structural integrity of combustion chambers for longer durations, at potentially higher temperatures, will provide substantial engine performance improvements. Ultramet will team with C-CAT, a leading C/C manufacturer, and Rocketdyne, which will provide hot-fire testing and technical assistance.",

The very shallow penetration of the laser light into the silicon surface localizes the heating and results in an extremely low thermal budget that facilitates the use of glass substrates or the construction of multilayer (stacked) circuitry. Good process repeatability requires the development of accurate in situ monitors that directly measure dose and junction depth. We propose to survey candidate monitoring techniques, to determine how the most promising might be implemented, to analytically determine the resulting detection limits and suggest a series of phase II experiments to verify the selected approaches. This will expedite the development of a real time, process controlled, P-GILD technology. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - This program will develop new fabrication tools that will: 1. Reduce cost of fabrication facilities for semiconductor devices and integrated circuits. 2. Produce smaller junction dimensions in semiconductor devices and integrated circuits.",

Immobilized enzymes are used to facilitate oxidation of the target molecules, producing hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide then oxidizes an immobilized luminophore, producing quanta of visible light which are conducted along a fiber-optic pathway to a photodetector. Using this technique, sensors can be developed with low parts per billion (ppb) detection limits for a broad range of aqueous substances such as alcohols, sugars, amino acids, and inorganic oxidants. The technique can readily be adapted to both the analysis of individual sample and to the on-line continuous monitoring of an aqueous stream and also forms the basis for development of highly specific and sensitive detectors for gas and liquid chromatography.",

Due to these requirements, structural design is ideally carried out through an optimization process where weight, strength, bulk, and other design requirements are studied through trade-off analysis. Through this process lightweight composite material has become the material of choice. Unfortunately, the complex structure of composites does not allow for ease of determination of structural integrity under dynamic or even some static conditions due to its highly anisotropic nature and strain rate strength dependency. To remedy this situation, a modeling technique is proposed to be developed based on philosophy of approach beginning with analytical modeling leading to numerical modeling. Fundamentals of the basic properties of polymer honeycomb core material combined with analysis of the individual composite components of face plates and adhesive will be studied by experts in materials. Dynamic loading response of the composite material will be analyzed by experts in both anisotropic materials and shock physics. The philosophy of approach proposed has led to the development of breadthroughs in other shock physics types of problems including projectile penetration and nuclear weapon shock wave analysis.",

        "abstract": "Performance requirements for existing and future gun systems demand improved lethality at longer ranges. This translates directly into increased muzzle velocity which is achieved by increasing propelling charge energy and, possibly even operaitng pressure. This combination of factors usually results in a decrease in the effective gun barrel life. While improvements in barrel technology to mitigate wear problem are warranted, barrel improvements alone may not be the most cost effective means for achieving an acceptable barrel wear life. By addressing wear life as a cost-driven systems problem, some of the burden for reducing barrel wear may be shifted to the ammuntion, in the form of wear-reducing additives. In the proposed program, a gun and ammunition system will be selected and wear additive development will be performed and demonstrated for that system. Additive formualtion and configuration work will be performed to address physical properties, combustion product chemistry, deployment requirements and characteristics, and the cost of implementation. Analyses will also be performed to scale additive concepts to different calibers and cartridge configurations.",

In fact children under the age of 13 represent the fastest growingexposure group overall. Estimates indicate that there may be 3,000 HIV infected children born everyyear in New York City alone. Pediatric HIV/AIDS is not relegated to big cities, however, and childreninfected with HIV/AIDS are enrolling in schools across the country. Preliminary research indicates thatdespite policies and procedures and availability of resources on HIV prevention, few practical materialsare available to instruct teachers how best to prepare for and work with students in the classroom whohave HIV or AIDS. We will investigate the feasibility of a proactive, comprehensive, video-based trainingprogram for early childhood and primary level educators on HIV/AIDS.

        "abstract": "Vexcel Corporation, together with the Ohio State University Center for Mapping, propose the development of a system for gathering and processing pavement surface distress data including the automated generation of pavement surface distress information suitable for input to a pavement management system (PMS). The proposed system will provide the flexibility of direct support for multiple data inputs including use of video, digital camera and analog film products. Additionally, system elements for recording and processing the data can take on different configurations including options for storage capacities, vehicle speed, stereo imaging and real-time operations. The approach applies machine vision and precise positioning technologies to the field of pavement surfave condition evaluation that will provide unique advantages over current practices. These advantages include dramatic increased processing throughout afforded by direct digital imaging and the use of automated image processing techniques. In addition, photogrammetric methods may afford accurate, useful, 3-D measurements that can supplement the 2-D imagery used in the distress computations. Anticipated Benefits: Results of the proposed research have direct applicability for use by Federal government agencies in areas of roads in Federal lands such as national parks and forests and roads, airports and ports on military facilities. In addition to the FHWA requirements for pavement management utilizing distress data acquisition, there are approximately 5 million other lane miles of state, city and country roads for which distress data acquisition is becoming increasingly important. Roadways and parking areas in parks, schools, shopping malls, etc. often require distress data acquisition in connection with the planning and programming of pavement maintenance and rehabilitation activities.",

Thedevelopment of improved vaccine adjuvants for use in humans has therefore become a priority area ofresearch. Nevertheless, research on adjuvants has lagged seriously behind the work done onimmunogenes. For decades the only adjuvant widely used in humans has been alum. Saponin and itspurified component Quil A, Freund's complete adjuvant and other adjuvants sued in research andveterinary applications have toxicities which limit their potential use in human vaccines. New chemicallydefined preparations such as muramyl dipeptide and monophosphoryl lipid A are being studied. TheVirus Research Institute is interested in the development of vaccines to combat infectious disease. Amajor focus is the study of delivery systems and adjuvants that will induce a state of systemic immunity.Microencapsulation is the core technology in this endeavor. An area of adjuvant research that hasdeveloped over the last few years is the utilization of synthetic polymers such as polylactide-co-glycolide(PLGA) in the formulation of a vaccine to effect the controlled release of antigens. The cleardisadvantage of this polymer is the required use of organic solvents that are detrimental to labileantigens. The overall goal of the SBIR Phase I work is to develop a microsphere configured vaccinevehicle based on a water soluble polyphosphazene polymer. This goal will be accomplished byoptimizing both the generation of 1-10 micron diameter microspheres for each of five polyphosphazenepolymers and determining the dose and route to administration that maximize the rapidity, amplitude andduration of the antibody response to a single antigen dose. The distribution of the antibody responseover the IgG subclasses and the cellular immune response will be determined.

Using alginate high in guluronic acid content, we have successfully reverseddiabetes in the spontaneous diabetic dog model following intraperitoneal (IP) encapsulated allograft.Two-year follow-up studies in five dogs successfully treated with encapsulated islets demonstrated thatmultiple transplants were safe and efficacious with excellent long-term glycemic control and ongoinggraft function even after discontinuation of all antirejection drugs. Toxicity studies of the capsuledemonstrated no evidence of acute toxicity or mutagenicity. These studies formed the preclinical basisfor human clinical trials. We have completed our first human clinical transplant of encapsulated isletsin a Type I diabetic patient and have demonstrated ongoing islet function over six months posttransplant. In order for this technology to be made available to the 1.1 million diabetic patients whocould benefit from this procedure xenograft encapsulated islets must be developed. We will develop isletisolation techniques from pig pancreata utilizing collagenase developed by recombination DNAtechnology, and demonstrating that encapsulated porcine islets can reverse diabetes in the small animalmodel.",

        "abstract": "The proposed projet is to prove the universal capabilities of the Expert Sensor technology by applying it to a novel chemical sensor suite composed of an array of the newly developed porous silicon chemical sensors. The Expert Sensor architecture provides a standard intelligent interface between various sources of sensor data being input into the multimedia imaging helmet and the high level information processors needed within the helmet to generate images. Embedding the Expert Sensor architecture into advanced imaging helmets allows the creation of a single general purpose helmet; the same helmet can be used for many diverse and normally unassociated applications. Recent work has shown that the energy maximum and intensity of the photoluminescence of porous silicon can be reversibly modified by chemical adsorbates. By applying different surface treatments the porous silicon, the material can be tailored to respond to differently towards specific chemicals, however the sensitivity and selectivity to various chemicals is complex and highly interrelated. ExperChem uses the Expert Sensor architecture to deconvolve the complex non-specific luminescence of the porous silicon into the component concentrations of complex gas mixtures. Anticipated Benefits: When used in conjunction with a multimedia imaging helmet, ExperChem provides the user with immediate reliable information about local gas concentrations. The expected benefits of this capability to the federal government and private sector include: air quality monitoring to protect personnel from toxic, flammable, or otherwise dangerous gases; information for on-line machinery maintenance, process control, and damange control; and immediate on-site environmental monitoring and chemical detection.",

The design is based upon the silicon micromachining technology developed by Waddan Systems. The highly integrated chip utilizes three multisensors and one accelerometer to yield the six acceleration components. In a multisensor a pair of silicon accelerometers are made side by side with their input axes parallel to each other. They are interconnected by an electrostatically driven dither mechanism perpendicular to the input axes. A linear acceleration input produces the same response in both the devices, but an angular rate normal to the linear acceleration input axes produces equal but opposite Coriolis components in the accelerometers. By adding and subtracting the accelerometer output signals, one measures both the linear acceleration and the angular rate applied to the multisensor. The angular rate along with a clock input yields the angular acceleration. The device has both military and commercial applications.",

Operators remove the dust by vacuum cleaning and scrubbing with tissues, and hence areexposed to high levels of toxic and carcinogenic material. The hazard will be eliminated by chemicalremoval of the arsenic. This will eliminate the health risk to operators, decrease operator turnover (thepuller cleaning job is generally detested) and improve the economics of the process by saving the hoursspent cleaning.

It offers the most in board configuration flexibility for making optimal use of space in electronic packaging, improving performance of electronics packages, and reducing maintenance. However, adhesive failure of the rigid-flex materials during use has degraded the performance of military avionics systems. Adhesive failure is often caused by differences in the coefficient of thermal expansion and moisture absorption. The objective of this research topic is to investigate alternatives to the epoxies, polyimides, and adhesives currently used in rigid-flex PWBs. The focus will be on high-temperature thermoplastics. High-performance engineering thermoplastics such as polyetheretherketone (PEEK), polyetherimide (PEI) and liquid crystal polymers (LCPs) are less hygroscopic and tend to be more dimensionally stable than materials that are currently used. Because thermoplastic materials are remeltable, QUEST proposes to eliminate the use of adhesives by using simple fusion bonding techniques to join rigid-flex PWBs. This would improve adhesion by eliminating problems with material compatibility and differences in coefficient of thermal expansion. Additional benefits of using thermoplastics and fusion bonding techniques are decreased moisture absorption, increased dimension stability, improved mechanical properties, simplified manufacturing, and the infinitie storage life of raw materials.

A cylindrical balance 2 inches in diameter and 6 inches long that uses a set of X-flexures will be considered as a candidate design. To satisfy the requirement for achieving a natural frequency of 100 Hz, the balance must be designed with very stiff flexures. The displacement of the sensing elements due to the loads imposed on them will be sensed with a fiber-optic sensing technique. Because the flexures are stiff, the displacements are small and require amplification. We will take advantage of mechanical leverage incorporated into the balance design to provide the amplification. The small displacements of the fiber-optic flexure balance will be sensed with a modified and upgraded commercial fiber-optic sensor, which is currently being used in a fiber-optic transducer under development at QUEST. During Phase I, we will develop and test a two-component laboratory balance. A six component prototype balance will then be designed and tested in Phase II. To strengthen our capability in the proposed R&D, we have invited the participation of two Boeing engineers specialized in sting-mounted balance design, fabrication, and operations.

        "abstract": "This proposal describes an innovative technical approach for the design and development of visually covert, low-power, low-gain antennas operating in selected portions of the 2-200OMHz frequency band. Our approach is two-fold: firstly, we propose to use planar radiating elements that (a) incorporate continuous impedance loading to extend the normal operating range or (b) have inherently broadband properties at the higher frequencies of interest; and secondly, we propose fabricating the antennas by sputtering or etching the antenna elements onto flexible plastic sheets that can be covered with a thin anti-reflective coating to further reduce the visual signature. This combined approach results in antennas with impedance characteristics that can be matched with a small fixed network or by a simple impedance transformation and are visually covert. The proposed antennas can be incorporated into the fabrication of composite or other non-conducting parts (Class I antennas) or easily affixed to conducting or non-conducting areas of a platform with minimal surface preparation (Class II antennas). Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - Military applications include: remote tracking and monitoring; mission protection and clandestine operations; concealing within soldier's clothing. Commercial appeal for general aviation, pleasure boating, cellular telephones in automobiles, and remote tracking of vehicles such as delivery trucks, trains and shipments of hazardous waste.",

        "abstract": "It is now possible to use fluids beyond the liquid range to lubricate surfaces with thin condensate films that provide complete surface separation with EHD mechanisms. The lubricant, supplied internally or externally as a vapor, eliminates complex hardware associated with recirculating oil systems. The temperature range over which EHD lubrication prevails is significantly extended. Vapor has been demonstrated in rolling element bearings with smooth surfaces and near rolling conditions. The proposed effort is to show the feasibility of vapor lubricated gear surfaces which have high sliding velocities and rough surfces compared to rolling element bearings - a necessary requirement for many advanced propulsion systems. The approach is to develop a tribo-contact system with low traction and excellent run-in characteristics to allow thin film EHD lubrication. The traction of PFPE fluids decreases with temperature (i.e. sliding velocity). With sufficiently high molecular weight PFPE's, EHD films can prevail for long life, reliable lubrication. Surfaces can be run-in topographically with silver or copper coatings which also enhances heat dissipation. Vaporized EP additives shall be used to enhance the boundary lubrication performance of the tribo-contact. The vapor lubricated contact shall be evaluated with the WAM3 test machine which is unique in its ability to simulated gear mesh conditions.",

No comprehensive modeling capability of this type exists in the medical communitytoday. The analytical bases for this numerical simulation research are time-domain finite elementmethods. Temporal integration of the finite element equations provides complete linear or nonlinearsolutions of the ultrasound and bioheat equations in two-or three-dimensional (2D or 3D) domains thatconform to tissue boundaries. The aim is to develop the necessary software and make it accessible toall interested parties, both commercial and academic.

The lower cost will be due to eliminating hand labor to administer the present safeguard against mixed weld wire. The eddy current alloy sorting test will adapt the mature technology of defect inspection for long life, high pressure high temperature tubing. The pickup coil will be designed for sensitivity adequate to detect steady state and transient changes of composition and microstructure due to wire grade change. The parameters of possible and actual grade changes will be determined by a test of several stainless steel rod end-to-end welds. Technical problems avoided would include possible hot cracking during welding and excessive corrosion in service. Administrative burdens to low overhead technically capable welding shops, incentives to decline to bid, would also be removed. Cost, delivery and availability problems could be eliminated.",

It has made a tremendous impact on theability of physicians to perform accurate punch biopsies for histological analysis. However, the difficultyin training gynecologists in the recognition of pathology has hindered the full utilization of colposcopy.Colposcopic images contain complex and confusing lesion patterns. Correctly analyzing and classifyingdifferent types of tissues require substantial training. The goal of this research is to develop imageanalysis software to help physicians classify various abnormal cervical tissue patterns in colposcopicexaminations. Such software will enhance the capability of colposcopy by increasing the diagnosticaccuracy and speed, and simplifying the use of colposcopy, making its utilization more widespread andaccurate. To recognize various vascular patterns characterizing different stages of dysplasia, textureanalysis techniques will be used. We will use the texture spectrum method to represent the vascularpatterns and to design features. Our primary objectives in Phase I are to implement this technique,evaluate its performance using a series of test images, and improve it. The Phase I effort will result inprototype software for discriminating vascular patterns. In Phase II, we will refine the software, conductclinical trails, compare its performance with results from biopsies, and enhance its user-interfacecapability.",

Mechanical valves now are employed only with warfarinanticoagulation, a significant contributor to the morbidity and mortality associated with their use. Theapproach to be investigated is to eliminate the discontinuity between the smooth surface of the valvering and the textured surface of the suture cuff used for surgical fixation. This is to be accomplishedby employing an integrally textured metal surface on the valve ring. The new valve is a tilting diskdesign using a pyrolytic carbon-coated occluder. The valve will be studied in vitro in a pulse duplicatorto characterize its forward flow pressure gradient, effective open area, and overall efficiency. Flowvisualization will be used to adjust the valve geometry to eliminate regions of stasis or flow separation.Wear of the textured metal surface will be examined by constructing an accelerated cyclic test fixturewhich will enable prototype valves to be tested for mechanical wear for the equivalent of two years ofreal time operation. Finally, a series of valves are to be implanted in adult sheep to study the in vivoperformance and safety of the prosthesis. If successful, the textured surface valve has the potential toreduce or eliminate the requirement for warfarin use, while providing a prosthesis with greatermechanical endurance than bioprosthetic tissue valves, the most commonly used alternative to themechanical valves currently available.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this program is the development of a fibrin tissue adhesive which will be usable under battlefield conditions. The new adhesive will be a blood activated, single agent system which is applied directly to the site of bleeding. It consists chiefly of a mixture of fibrin monomer and tissue fibronectin which will form an adherent fibrin clot on contact with bleeding tissue. The Phase I program is devoted entirely to examining the ability of the material to produce hemostasis and adhere to the tissue. The material will be tested in vitro and in animal experiments, and its performance is to be compared with a commerically available (Europe) fibrin adhesive. In these tests, it will be tested both in its natural form and when encapsulated in polymeric nanospheres. We believe the adhesive must be part of a wound dressing system which will produce hemostatsis and protect the site of injury from contamination. The dressing is also a potential vehicle for eluting antimicrobial agents or tissue growth fractors at the site to promote healing. The would dressing provides a delivery system for the fibrin adhesive in the case of deep tissue injury as well.",

        "abstract": "Fatigue problem has been an important issue in aeropropulsion system composite structures due to acoustic pressure, vibration and hostile environments. Various forms of damage caused by fatigue loadings can degrade the structural properties. This Phase I research proposes a combined BEM/FEM approach (using 2-D and 3-D elasticity theory) for dynamic analyses of aeropropulsion system structures. The thicker part of the structure or the portion with complex shape will be analyzed using a BEM whereas the thinner section will be analyzed using a FEM. The new BEM proposed will be able to accurately analyze anisotropic materials and structures subjected to acoustic pressure and various forms of dynamic loadings. The proposed methodology will capture the advantages of both the FEMs and the BEMs and achieve an optimal combination of efficiency, accuracy and cost. A user friendly computer program with this BEM/FEM model and a fatigue criterion will be developed for the probabilistic design of aeropropulsion system structures. Dr. Tan and Dr. Li have published individually nearly forty papers related to this topic. Once the computer program is parallelized in phase II of this program it will be an excellent multidisciplinary design and analysis tool for aeropropulsion system involving multi- components.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this work is the development of 3 - 5 micron sensors operating at temperatures from 30C to 70C, for use in Space-Based Surveillance Systems without the use of Cryo-coolers, or uncooled. It is based on a major breakthrough achieved at Xacton. This has led to the fabrication of wafers of Mercury Cadmium Telluride with a very high level of crystalline perfection, very low defect density and extremely uniform in composition, wavelength and other properties. This has resulted in the fabrication of sensors with unmatched performance at elevated temperatures, including room temperature operation. Some of the disadvantages of the Cryo-coolers are that they have only a limited lifetime, are not very reliable, and are heavy and expensive. Therefore, their elimination in the space-based surveillance systems can make the system much simpler to design and fabricate, with increased reliability and lifetime, and also result in considerable cost reduction. In Phase I, we plan to fabricate and deliver 3 - 5 micron detectors with excellent performance at elevated temperatures, e.g., 30C to -70C. In Phase II, it will lead to the fabrication of sensors that can be used in actual Space-Based Surveillance Systems without the use of ryo-coolers or uncooled.",

        "abstract": "Energy-dispersive x-ray detectors (EDDs) are heavily used in biological research at synchrotronradiation facilities, particularly for absorption spectroscopy in fluorescence mode on dilute samples.Current research relies on semiconductor EDD spectrometers, which typically become pileup limited atfairly low count rates for the biologically important elements P, S and CI, due to the long electronicprocessing times required to obtain acceptable energy resolution for these soft x-rays. The presentresearch proposes to develop an alternative detector based on electron multiplication technology.Although electron multipliers are very low noise amplifiers and are capable of very high counting rates,presently available scintillator-photomultiplier (PMT) detectors are not competitive with semiconductorEDDs due to their extremely poor energy resolution, which arises from statistical fluctuations in theinefficient conversion between x-rays and electrons for amplification by the PMT. We are thereforegoing to investigate a novel technology for increasing the efficiency of the conversion process. Initialcalculations suggest that if this conversion process can be made to work close to its theoreticalefficiency, it would be possible to construct detectors having energy resolution superior to semiconduc-tor EDDs for energies below 4 keV and capable of throughputs in excess of 106 counts/sec. Becauseno complex electronics would be required to process these detectors' output pulses, they would alsobe relatively inexpensive to array for even higher count rate capability.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR program is aimed at improving the power density of rechargeable cells in general, and particularly those used in underwater vehicles. We intend to achieve that objective by advancing the state-of_the-art of bipolar electrodes, where both positive and negatives are built on a common current collector of the \"pile\" batteries made with them, which are capable of over four til the power output per unit volume, compared to conventional (monopolar) batteries. The major obstacles to the development of such batteries have been (1) the problem of intercell electrolyte leakage, which creates parasitic currents, and 9 leads to failure and (2) overheating. However, we are confident to overcome those obstacles by using recently developed heat resistant plastics and adhesives, and individual cell valves capable of containing the electrolyte, at the same time allowing excessive gas pressure to vent. Although the work and performance projections included in this proposal are based on convey negative electrodes and separators, any improvements on those components from the ongoing Phase II SBIR program under Contract No. N6O291-93-C-OO62 will be incorporated.",

Such sampling is required prior to preparation of storm water quality management plans and will be required on an annual basis to document compliance with those plans. This project will develop and test a working model of a novel system for distributed, unattended storm water discharge monitoring that is capable of accurate metering and sampling of storm water discharges without on-site calibration of the metering site. The system will be comprised of a family of primary flow metering elements (flow tubes) and normally-off, low-power sensors that can be configured and interrogated over a wireless communication channel by a PC hosting user-friendly Windows(tm) -compatible software. The system will be designed to be compatible with and actuate distributed, unattended rain gauges and automatic samplers and to provide a well-mixed flow stream from which representative grab and composite samples can be obtained. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - Phase I research will investigate the technical feasibility of a system for distributed, unattended monitoring of storm water discharges.

It will also serve as the shoulder pointing subsystem for singularity-free manipulator arms, such as the spherical arm-subassembly. These new manipulators will meet the need addressed in the subtopic by minimizing interaction forces caused by singularities and by increasing the reliability of current singularity-free systems by reducing the required number of actuators in their design. The proposed effort aims to complete a conceptual design for a two-actuator, spherical, singularity-free double pointing system, construct an experimental mock-up of this design, and develop the kinematic equations for this system when it is applied as the pointing subsystems for three types of manipulator geometries. Both NASA and industry will benefit from having such systems, which will provide greater dexterity than present industrial systems, effectively eliminate all internal workspace singularities, and increase the reliability of singularity-free systems.",

Nonetheless, over 80% of liver failure patients improvephysiologically and neurologically during treatment with the device; most recover liver function orproceed to liver transplant. In the current study, we will add acid-filled liquid membrane capsules to thesorbent suspension to remove ammonia, and will pre-load the charcoal with branch chain amino acidsto return these amino acids to the patient during treatment. In vitro tests will determine.the effect ofthese sorbent changes on ammonia removal and branch-chain generation, and will determine whetherthere is any loss of organic toxin removal. Phase II clinical studies will determine whether the newchemical functions of the sorbent improve the treatment of patients with hepatic coma.",

An optional mode can be implemented where only the interrogator must transmit signals which can be highly covert due to the nature of the system. The system uses a unique source of electromagnetic energy for its carrier that is available anywhere in the world.

Such a flight demonstration would support technology insertion for the 1998-1999 DSCS program or other military satellite systems. Fast packet switching is a connectionless switching mechanism, in which data packets are routed from uplink to downlink beams according to the routing information contained in the packet header. Its main characteristic is self-routing without network control station or onboard network controller. Packets generated from the same data source and transmitted in the same uplink slot can be routed to different downlink beams. Fast packet satellite switching has a number of advantages over circuit switching but requires traffic flow and congestion control to minimize buffer overflow at the satellite. The SPEC/COMSAT lab. team will analyze/synthesize the key parameters of FPSS to support ASIC implementation in CMOS and/or GaAs chip and multichip module (MCM) technology. FPSS supports a military concept for fast packet satellite switching, identifies and resolves critical system design issues, identifies development areas, and designs of a candidate fast packet satellite switch.",

        "abstract": "To attain high levels of accuracy and robustness advanced seekers require increasingly sophisticated image signal processing. Much of the signal processing needed is difficult to do efficiently with digital hardware, as it involves billions of simple operations per second. A digital processor is much more efficient at command and control tasks such as interpreting the processed image signals and manipulating actuators for guidance. Dedicated analog IC hardware is best suited to seeker image signal processing, as it can perform the essential repetitive tasks quickly and compactly with little power comsumption. Neuromorphic analog processors are particularly well suited to the needs of advanced seeker designers. These chips perform simple operations in a massively parallel manner akin to the neural computations of the eye and brain. Under development over the past ten years, a few neuromorphic chips are now available for evaluation. Computational speed, temperature stability, etc of these chips should be characterized to determine the degree of applicability of the present state of the art. In Phase I, we will perform a variety of tests on the neuromorphic image low-pass filter, fabricated by Amber Electronics, Inc. In particular, since this processor was designed for operation at low temperatures (but may work well at room temperature), noise and performance characteristics will be measured across a temperature range.",

We propose to develop an electronic design, synthesis, and management tool targeted at low-power, asynchronous circuit design. We will DELIVER a functional prototype tool during Phase I. The Phase II tool will support VHDL as a hardware description language. The synthesis capabilities will include support for high-level language input, technology mapping, automated layout synthesis, and limited built-in test support using boundary-scan and full-scan techniques. The tool will be tightly integrated into our existing low-cost component-level integrated circuit design and synthesis tools. The tool will support industry standard CAD formats, and frameworks (e.g. CFI) where appropriate. A novel self-timed synthesis methodology will be used, permitting fully static circuits that have been shown to operate robustly with power supply voltages less than 1V. In conjunction with the inherent power advantages of asynchronous circuits, this power supply flexibility permits a wide tradeoff of operating speed vs. power consumption, in the field. During Phase I we will develop the asynchronous circuit synthesis software. We will also implement and deliver a prototype design tool, and fabricate a test IC designed with the tool. The Phase I design and prototype prepares for Phase II implementation of the complete system.",

        "abstract": "High resolution focal plane sensors typically exhibit significant pixel-to-pixel nonuniformities. These display artifacts are often larger than the minimum resolvable intensity variation in a single pixel, and consequently, limit the resolution of the system to a fraction of its potential. We propose to design an analog integrated circuit architecture that will perform 2-point (i.e., gain and offset) correction on a pixel by pixel basis. During the Phase I effort, we will design and manufacture prototype integrated circuits that will prove the concept. At this time, we anticipate that a complete system to correct a 256x256 sensor at 30 frames/sec will comprise 16 or fewer integrated circuits (with a total silicon die area of 10 cm ). Advanced integrated circuit fabrication processes could reduce this area to a single IC. Potential advantages over DSP solutions include: single chips solutions for 256x256 focal planes, ultra-low power consumption (less than 1mW), very high processing speed (10 Mpixels/sec per chip), scalable architectures to match any sensor configuration, and full analog processing for compatibility with existing sensor interfaces. The analog offset-gain corrector is compatible with an automatic gain control (AGC) circuit that matches the dynamic range of an image (up to 12 bits) with the reduced (8-bit) dynamic range of display/storage media.",

        "abstract": "Innovative Dynamics, Inc. is proposing the development of a Smart Inlet Protection System, SIP, for composite engine inlets. The system integrates IDI's proven capacitive ice detection technology with multiple heaters embedded inot the composite structure. An array of sensors can determine icing impingement limits and identify the presence of runback water. Control logic then activates only the heaters within the impingement limits and then optimizes the heat flux to just eliminate runback for the current icing conditions thus minimizing power consumption. SIP can also improve flight safety in adverse weather conditions. In the event of severe icing or damage to the heaters the control logic can monitor for runback water with the thermal system at full capacity. When these conditions exist continuted safe operation is in jeopardy and the pilot would be notified to take immediate action. The ice detection technology proposed has been proven through numerous wind tunnel and flight tests and will not require much development effort. The Phase I program will focus on optimiztion of the control system and fabrication and testing of a composite specimen. During the Phase II effort IDI will team with BFGoodrich De-Icing Systems to produce a flight ready inlet components.",

If Phase I is successful, we will collaborate with nCHIP in Phase II to optimize the JVD processes and equipment for low cost, automated manufacture of multichip modules. We will commercialize results of this SBIR program through licensing use of JVD MCM production equipment for the MCM industry, thus achieving important transfer of technology.

Traditionally, contaminated soils have been excavated and transported off site to a hazardous waste incinerator. This process has significant economic and public relations disadvantages. It is proposed in this study that a two stage proprietary slurry phase treatment strategy be developed for the treatment of dioxin contaminated soils to provide a lower cost treatment technology that is potentially implementable on-site. The first stage of this process would use a chemical agent to make the compounds more amenable to biological treatment. This would be followed by a biological process to complete the degradation process. The combined process would either completely mineralize or largely detoxify the components of interest. The partial success achieved by other investigators using chemical processes to treat dioxins in soil and in biological processes to degrade suggest that the proposed process which couples these two technologies has a good possibility of success.",
