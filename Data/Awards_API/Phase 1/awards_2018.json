        "abstract": "No other group of diseases encompasses a greater pathophysiology than do the rheumatic diseases \nSpanning multiple organ systems  clinical decisions often rely on coordinated efforts from primary care\nproviders and rheumatologists to rule in or rule out differential diagnoses when treating inflammatory conditions\nsuch as rheumatoid arthritis  RA  and systemic lupus erythematosus  SLE   RA is a symmetric  inflammatory \nperipheral polyarthritis leading to deformity of joints via erosion of bone and surrounding cartilage  SLE can\naffect virtually any organ leading to fatigue  fever  myalgia  weight change and complications associated with\nrenal  central nervous system  and hematologic systems can be life threatening  RA and SLE are diagnosed\nthrough clinical judgment after excluding alternative diagnoses  In the case of both diseases  individual\nlaboratory tests are effective only in a portion of the disease population  In RA  testing for rheumatoid factor\nand anti CCP antibodies provide very important information when positive  However  these two analytes\nremain negative in      of patients and continue to be negative throughout diagnostic follow up in     of\npatients with RA  Further  erythrocyte sedimentation rates  ESR  and c reactive protein  CRP  levels are\ngenerally strongly correlated with radiographic findings of joint damage  These measurements  however  can\nbe elevated by other infectious and inflammatory processes that are not specific for RA or can be altered  in\nthe case of ESR  by acute phase reactants from malignancy  tissue injury  or trauma  In SLE  exclusion of\nmarkers diagnostic for RA coupled with presence of markers measuring antinuclear antibodies  ANA  and\nfollowed by assays measuring double stranded DNA  dsDNA   anti Sm  anti Ro SSA  anti La SSB  anti U \nRNP  or antiribosomal P are frequently used  Across these analyses  the sensitivity and specificity for these\nlaboratory measurements vary greatly and many have high specificity to rule in SLE but lack sensitivity as\nthese diagnostic markers can be found in other disorders  For instance  anti Ro anti La are found in Sjogrenandapos s\nsyndrome and anti U  RNP is frequently associated with mixed connective tissue disease  As a physician\ncolleague pointed out   it is difficult to diagnose a negative   Thus  diagnostic approaches for both RA and SLE\noften rely on multiple  independent laboratory tests combined with clinical observation  Distinguishing between\nthese diseases is important  as the treatment procedures for these diseases are different  Time is a frequent\nfactor in the diagnosis of these diseases and tools are needed to facilitate earlier diagnosis as treatment for\nautoimmune diseases are highly effective and early initiation of therapy leads to the best outcomes \nMisdiagnosis of these conditions is also not uncommon \n Another common disease seen by rheumatologists is fibromyalgia syndrome  FMS   FMS is a common\ncause of widespread musculoskeletal pain that affects tendons  ligaments  and muscle  FMS is difficult to\ndiagnose and treat and a critical clinical point is that FMS is not explained by another rheumatic or systemic\ndisorder  Thus  FMS is a diagnosis of exclusion once other etiologies have been considered and excluded  RA\nand SLE are two diseases that must be eliminated from the differential diagnosis  Given the complicated\ndiagnostic process these patients are often forced to endure  recent studies have also suggested that\nhealthcare dollars are saved post diagnosis and patient outcomes improve  To date  there is no laboratory test\nthat can determine presence or absence of these three conditions from a single blood sample \n The question of whether or not disease classifiers capable of providing clinically useful information could be\nbuilt based upon disease specific expression levels of mRNAs in whole blood has been a subject of research\nfor greater than ten years  Many disease specific gene expression signatures have been identified in the\nresearch lab  A few of these have even progressed into commercially viable diagnostic tests  notably for\nsystemic sclerosis \n Long non coding RNAs  lncRNA  are recently discovered regulatory RNA molecules that do not code for\nproteins but influence a vast array of biological processes  In vertebrates  the number of lncRNA genes greatly\nexceeds the number of protein coding genes  It is also thought that lncRNAs drive greater biologic complexity\nbetween vertebrates and invertebrates  These lncRNAs also show much greater cell type specific expression\npatterns than mRNAs  Humans also develop many more complex diseases than other organisms  As such \nour data presented in preliminary studies  support the notion that disease associated lncRNAs exhibit far\ngreater differences in expression than disease associated mRNAs  In this application  we propose to explore\nthe hypothesis that lncRNAs are better biomarkers of human disease than mRNAs  Here  we will focus on\nFMS and rheumatic diseases as disease categories and have identified FMS and rheumatic disease \nassociated differentially expressed lncRNAs  Study of lncRNAs in human autoimmune disease is in its infancy\nand exploration of lncRNAs as biomarkers of autoimmune disease has not been previously addressed  We\npropose the following specific aim  To identify annotated and novel lncRNAs differentially expressed among\nCTRL  FMS  RA  and SLE and assess their function as biomarkers to distinguish FMS  RA  and SLE subjects\nfrom healthy subjects and subjects with other rheumatic diseases Diagnosis of fibromyalgia syndrome and other rheumatic diseases can be a difficult  long and costly process\nand misdiagnosis of these diseases is not uncommon  Long non coding RNAs  lncRNA  are a new class of\nregulatory RNA molecules that exhibit high degrees of cell type specific expression  The hypothesis we will\ntest in this application is that measurement of expression of disease specific lncRNAs in rheumatic diseases\nand fibromyalgia syndrome will have greater utility to provide meaningful clinical information to health care\nproviders faced with these diagnostic dilemmas than measurement of disease specific mRNAs",
