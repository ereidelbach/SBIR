TARGET IDENTIFICATION WHICH INVOLVES COMPLEX HUMAN DECISION MAKING IS NOT VERY RELIABLE UNDER THE STRESS OF COMBAT ENGAGEMENT, EVEN THOUGH A DISTINCT AND UNAMBIGUOUS TARGET IMAGE IS AVAILABLE. IN MANY PRACTICL APPLICATIONS OF AUTOMATED VISION, THE EXACT SHAPE OF THE OBJECT TO BE RECOGNIZED IS KNOWN IN ADVANCE. FOR THE U.S. ARMY, IN MOST INSTANCES, THE BATTLEFIELD TARGETS TO BE RECOGNIZED WILL BE COMBAT AND TRANSPORT VEHICLES, MISSILE AND GUN CARRIERS, AND INFANTRY SUPPORT HELICOPTERS AND AIRCRAFT. IN THIS KIND OF SITUATION, IT IS DESIRABLE AND POSSIBLE TO SPLIT THE COMPUTATION INTO TWO STATES: A MODEL-BUILDING STAGE IN WHICH USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT THE UNCHANGING TARGET CHARACTERISTICS IS COMPILED, AND AN EXECUTION STAGE IN WHICH THIS INFORMATION IS EXPLOITED FOR THE RAPID RECOGNITION OF TARGETS OF INTEREST IN THE IMAGE. THE RESULT OF OUR PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL BE A FAST, MACHINE-VISION PROGRAM FOR RECOGNIZING AND LOCATING BATTLEFIELD TARGETS IN IMAGES WITHOUT RESTRICTION ON THE ORIENTATION OF THE TARGETS IN SPACE. SUCH AN ARTIFICAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)-BASED PROGRAM WITH A HEURISTIC DATABASE WILL BE DEVELOPED ON A 32-BIT MICROPROCESSOR (E.G., MICROVAX II) AND WOULD EVENTUALLY RESIDE INSIDE A COMBAT OR VERY INTELLIGENT SURVEILLANCE AND TARGET ACQUISITION (VISTA) VEHICLE.",

ISSUES SUCH AS ENZYME STABILITY, MEMBRANE EXCLUSION PROPERTIES, BONDING, BIOCOMPATIBILITY, RESPONSE TIME, AND LINEARITY WILL BE CHARACTERIZED IN IN VITRO AND IN VIVO MODELS. THIS SENSOR WILL PROVIDE MORE THAN 2 MILLION INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETICS WITH THE FINE DYNAMIC CONTROL REQUIRED WHEN USING AN ARTIFICIAL BETA CELL.

        "abstract": "THE THERMAL-BARRIER CONCEPT FOR TANDEM MAGNETIC MIRRORS HAS GREATLY INHANCED THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF THIS APPROACH TO CONFINING HIGH-TEMPERATURE PLASMAS FOR FUSION POWER. TRANSIENT EXISTENCE OF THERMAL BARRIERS HAS ALREADY BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN THE TMX EXPERIMENT AT LIVERMORE AND IN THE GAMMA 10 EXPERIMENT IN JAPAN, USING ELECTRON CYCLOTRON HEATING (ECH) TECHNIQUES. IF THE THERMAL BARRIER ELECTROSTATIC POTENTIAL WELL IS TO BE MAINTAINED FOR SIGNIFICANT PERIODS OF TIME IN COLLISIONALLYEQUILIBRATED PLASMAS, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE, ECONOMICAL TECHNIQUES FOR PREVENTING THE ACCUMULATION OF POSITIVELY-CHARGED IONS IN THE POTENTIAL WELL. THAT IS, ELECTROSTATICALLY-TRAPPED IONS THAT HAVE DIFFUSED INTO THE WELL FROM THE CENTRAL CELL MUST BE PUMPED OUT OF THE WELL. NO ENTIRELY SATISFACTORY CONCEPT FOR ACCOMPLISHING THIS PUMPING HAS YET BEEN DEVELOPED, ALTHOUGH IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT RF ELECTRIC FIELDS PARALLEL TO THE CONFINING MAGNETIC FIELD COULD BE USEFUL FOR THIS PURPOSE IF THEIR SPACE AND TIME DEPENDENCES COULD BE SYNCHRONOUS WITH THE BALLISTIC MOTION OF THE MARGINALLY-TRAPPED IONS. HERE WE PROPOSE A NOVEL CONCEPT FOR CREATING SUITABLE ELECTRIC FIELDS DEEP IN THE INTERIOR OF THE THERMAL BARRIER PLASMA BY MODULATING THEFREQUENCY OF THE FUNDAMENTAL-RESONANCE ECH POWER. THE CONCEPT IS BASED ON THE WELL-KNOWN ACCUMULATION OF THE TURNING POINTS OF MILDLY-RELATIVISTIC ELECTRONS ABOUT THE RESONANT SURFACE WHERE THEIR GYROFREQUENCY MATCHES THE FREQUENCY OF ECH MICROWAVE POWER. THESE ELECTRONS, WHOSE ENERGIES ARE TYPICALLY SOME TENS OF KEV, ARE CONFINED WITHINA CYLINDER TERMINATED BY THE (SYMMETRIC) RESONANT SURFACES. THEIR DENSITY CAN APPARENTLY BE VARIED BY MODULATING THE ECHFREQUENCY. WE WILL SEEK TO ESTABLISH THE DYNAMICAL LIMITS ON THIS CONCEPT AND, IN PARTICULAR, ADAPT IT TO PROVIDE THE DESIRED SYNCHRONISM WITH TRAPPED IONS. A DEMONSTRATION OF THE CONCEPT WILL BE PLANNED FOR PHASE II.",

IT CURRENTLY HAS THE ABILITY TO SCAN A MEASUREMENT LASER BEAM IN ONE DIMENSION AND MEASURE THE POSITION OF THE SURFACE OF ALMOST ANY OBJECT IT STRIKES RELATIVE TO A REFERENCE PLANE. THIS NON CONTACT LINEAR DISPLACEMENT SENSOR PROJECT WOULD INVOLVE ADAPTING THE SCANNING MECHANISM SO THAT THE LASER BEAM WOULD BE DIRECTED ALTERNATELY AT THE PROBE AND AT THE MODEL'S SURFACE TO MEASURE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM. COMPUTER PROGRAMS WOULD BE DEVELOPED TO ACQUIRE AND STORE THE POSITION DATA. THE SCANNING SYSTEM, INCLUDING THE LIGHT SOURCE AND RECEIVING PHTO DETECTOR WOULD BE LOCATED SEVERAL FEET FROM THE MODEL, OUTSIDE OF THE MACH 6 WIND TUNNEL. IT WILL OPERATE BY PASSING THE LIGHT THROUGH A WINDOW IN THE TUNNEL WALL. THUS THE HIGH INTERNAL TEMPERATURE IS NOT A PROBLEM. FOR PROBE AND MODEL SURFACES WHICH ARE DIFFUSE REFLECTING SURFACES, IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO ALIGN THE LASER BEAM NORMAL TO THE SURFACES BUT ONLY KNOW THE INCIDENCE ANGLE, SINCE THE SYSTEM USES A RANGE FINDING TECHNIQUE. A MINOR CORRECTION TO THE SPEED OF LIGHT DUE TO THE TEMPERATURE AND DENSITY OVER THE REGION BETWEEN THE PROBE AND THE MODEL MAY BE REQUIRED. THE SENSITIVITY OF THIS CORRECTION WILL BE INVESTIGATED. A DEPTH OF FIELD OF A 20 CENTIMETERS IS PRACTICAL. THE VERSATILITY OF THE SCANNING SYSTEM ALLOWS THE USE OF A SIMPLE SCANNER TO MEASURE MORE THAN ONE PROBE, IF DESIRED.",

        "abstract": "IN THE DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS WASTES, ATTENTION MUST BE DIRECTED NOT ONLY TO THE PROBLEMS OF SAFE COLLECTION, TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE, BUT ALSO TO THE PROBLEM OF ISOLATING THE HAZARDOUS MATERIAL FOR A LONG TIME. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR RADIOACTIVE WASTES, WHICH NEED TO BE ISOLATED FOR MANY THOUSANDS OF YEARS. UNDERGROUND DISPOSAL IS AN OPTION THAT SHOW CONSIDERABLE PROMISE IF ASSURANCES CAN BE MADE TO ITS LONG-TERM SAFETY. A MAJOR CRITERION IN IDENTIFYING A SUITABLE SITE IS FOR THERE TO BE LITTLE WATER CIRCULATION TO PREVENT WIDESPREAD AND RAPID DISPERSAL IF THE STORAGE CONTAINERS ARE BREACHED. LOW CIRCULATION MAY BE ASSURED IF THE GROUNDWATER IS VERY OLD. THERE ARE MANY METHODS OF ESTIMATING GROUNDWATER AGES, BUT ATMOSPHERIC RADIONUCLIDES ARE, PERHAPS, THE MOST DIRECT AN MOST ACCURATE. TANDEM ACCELERATOR MASS SPECTROMETRY HAS RECENTLY MADE 36C1 (3.1X105 YR.) AVAILABLE AS A WATER DATINGTECHNIQUE. ANOTHER RADIONUCLIDE, 81KR (2.1X105 YR.), SHOWS GREAT PROMISE AS A WATER DATING METHOD AND HYDROLOGICAL TRACER. 81KR WILL COMPLEMENT INFORMATION GAINED FROM 36C1 AND OTHER DATING TECHNIQUES, AND BECAUSE OF THE CHEMICAL INERTNESS OF KRYPTON, MAY SIMPLIFY INTERPRETATION OF THE RESULTS. 81KR CANNOT BE MEASURED WITH TAMS. RESONANCE IONIZATION SPECTROSCOPY (RIS) INVOLVES THE STEPWISE EXCITATION, IONIZATION, AND COUNTING OF ATOMS OF A PRE-SELECTED ELEMENT. BECAUSE NARROW-BAND LASERS ARE USED, SUFFICIENT OPTICAL POWER ENABLES ALL OF THE ATOMS OF THE SELECTED ELEMENT TO BE IONIZED, WHILE THE INTERFERENCE FROM OTHER ELEMENTS REMAINS NEGLIGIBLE. THE IONS FORMED ARE EXTRACTED AND PASSED THROUGH A MASS SPECTROMETER, THEREBY ACHIEVING ISOTOPIC SELECTIVITY. BECAUSE OF THE VERY HIGH ISOTOPE RATIOS IN 81KR COUNTING, SEVERAL ENRICHMENT STEPS ARE REQUIRED BEFORE COUNTING BY RIS. IT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROGRAM TO DEVELOP 81KR COUNTING TO ENABLE ROUTINE MEASUREMENTS OF THIS IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL TRACER. PHASE I WILL CHARACTERIZE EXISTING ENRICHMENT PROCEDURES AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTICAL ENRICHMENT SYSTEMS. AS A TEST, THE 81KR CONTENT OF ATMOSPHERIC KRYPTON WILL BE MEASURED. PHASE II WILL DEVELOP THE ENRICHMENT SYSTEM AND TAILOR THE RIS ATOM COUNTING SYSTEM TO 81KR. MEASUREMENTS WILL BE MADE OF WELL CHARACTERIZED HYDROLOGICAL SAMPLES FOR COMPARISON.",

LIPOSOLUBLE VITAMIN DEFICIENCY IN HUMANS IS MOST OFTEN ENCOUNTERED IN PREMATURE INFANTS AND IN ADULTS OR CHILDREN HAVING ABNORMAL ABSORPTION OF FATS FROM THE INTESTINE. ATTENTION HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON THE ADMINISTRATIONOF A-TOCOPHEROL DUE TO THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PRE- MATURE INFANTS IN THE PAST DECADE.

        "abstract": "THE NEED FOR LARGE HIGH-PERFORMANCE ARRAYS ON NONPLANAR SURFACES, COUPLED WITH RECENT ADVANCES IN ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY, HAS RESULTED IN A RECENT SURGE OF INTEREST IN CONFORMAL ARRAYS. APPLICATIONS INCLUDE LARGE CONFORMAL ARRAYS ON AIRCRAFT FUSELAGE FOR SURVEILLANCE, ON ARTILLERY SHELLS, FOR MISSILE SEEKERS (AIR-TO-AIR, SURFACE-TO-AIR, AND AIR-TO-SURFACE APPLICATIONS) AND ON REENTRY VEHICLES. CONFORMAL ARRAYS HAVE PROVEN TO BE ATTRACTIVE ALTERNATIVES TO MOUNTING EXTERNAL RADOMES ON, CUTTING HOLES IN OR CHANGING THE SHAPES OF VEHICLES TO ACCOMMODATE AN ANTENNA. THESE ARRAYS ARE ESPECILLY ATTRACTIVE FOR APPLICATIONS WHICH REQUIRE WIDE ANGULAR COVERAGE WHILE MINIMIZING SCAN LOSS. HOWEVER, NON-PLANAR ARRAYS HAVE SOME UNIQUE FEATURES WHICH MUST BE RECOGNIZED. NOT THE LEAST OF THESE IS THAT CONFORMAL ARRAYS ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO DESIGN AND TO ANALYZE THAN ARE PLANAR ARRAYS. FURTHERMORE, COMPLEXITY IS ADDED WHEN SURFACE IS CONICAL, AS ON A REENTRY VEHICLE. THE TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH ARE TO FORMULATE AND VERIFY EXPRESSIONS FOR CHARACTERIZING THE RESPONSE OF CONICALLY CONFORMAL ARRAYS. TO DO THIS, DSA WILL MAKE USE OF EXISTING INNOVATIVE COMPUTER MODELS AND MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES. THE INTENDED RESULT IS TO ADD TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF CONFORMAL ARRAY PERFORMANCE AND TO DEVELOP TOOLS AND A DATA BASE FOR FUTURE ANALYSES.",

BY COMBINING AN ENZYME-LINKED ASSAY SYSTEM WITH CELL MEMBRANE FRAGMENTS IMMOBILIZED ON A GLASS MICROFIBER SUBSTRATE, ANTIBODIES IN 0.5 MICROLITER SAMPLES OF HUMAN SERUM CAN BE IDENTIFIED IN ABOUT 10 MINUTES, WITH UP TO 96 TESTS BEING PERFORMED SIMULTANEOUSLY. IN ADDITION,THE IMMOBILIZED ANTIGEN SHOWS NO NOTICEABLE LOSS OF SENSITIVITY FOR AT LEAST 6 MONTHS WHEN STORED AT ROOM TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY. THIS STABILITY IS SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN THE THREE WEEK SHELF-LIFE OF REFRIGERATED CELL PANELS ROUTINELY USED. TAKEN TOGETHER, OUR INITIAL WORK STRONGLY SUGGESTS THAT THIS NONAGGLUTINATION METHOD WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT PRACTICAL ADVANCE OVER TECHNIQUES NOW USED FORPRETRANSFUSION TESTING. ONCE REFINED, THIS SYSTEM MAY BE USED TO DETECT OTHER CLINICALLY RELEVANT ANTIBODIES SUCH AS THOSE TO HEPATITIS VIRUS ANTIGENS AND HTLV-III.",

THE PRINCIPLE ELEMENT OF THE SWITCH IS A HEAT PIPE CHAMBER WITH A FLEXIBLEENVELOPE. THE SWITCH IS PERMANENTLY ATTACHED TO THE HEAT SOURCE. INCREASING SOURCE TEMPERATURE ELEVATES THE HEAT PIPETEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE, EXPANDING ITS ENVELOPE TO CONTACT THE SINK. DECREASING SOURCE TEMPERATURE CAUSES THE HEAT PIPE ENVELOPE TO CONTRACT, INTERRUPTINGCONDUCTIVE HEAT TRANSFER TO THE SINK. THE VARIABLE CONDUCT IVE PATH TO THE SINK ENABLES THE SWITCH TO MAINTAIN CONSTANTSOURCE TEMPERATURE OVER A WIDE RANGE OF HEAT LOAD AND/OR SINK CONDITIONS. PROOF-OF-PRINCIPLE HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN A PREVIOUS NASA SPONSORED PROGRAM. INVESTIGATION OF DESIGN MODIFICATIONS TO ADAPT THE PRINCIPLE TO MEET THE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS OF A VARIABLE THERMAL RESISTANCE DEVICE IS PROPOSED.

PREVIOUS WORK HAS BEEN DONE ON THE DISSOLUTION OF URANIUM FOR ANALYSIS, WHERE URANIUM IS THE PRIMARY METAL, WHILE OTHER WORK HAS BEEN REPORTED ON THE PASSIFYING EFFECTS OF INHIBITORS ON METAL ALLOYS FOUND IN THE TARGET MATERIAL. OUR PRIMARY APPROACH IS TO SYNTHESIZE AND TEST COMBINATIONS OF THESE SOLVLENTS AND ADDITIVES TO ARRIVE AT A SUITABLE SOLVLENT SYSTEM. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE CHELATING AGENTS USED IN THE FIELD OF ION EXCHANGE AND LIQUID MEMBRANES THAT WILL STRONGLY COMPLEX URANIUM RELATIVE TO THE TARGET MATERIAL. ADDING THESE CHELATES TO A SOLVENT SOLUTION WOULD ACCELERATE THE RATE OF URANIUM DISSOLUTION, BUT INHIBIT THE RATE OF IRON DISSOLUTION. A SECOND, MORE INNOVATIVE APPROACH DEALS WITH THE SYNTHESIS AND TESTING OF ACID/CHELATE ADDITIVE COMBINATIONS. A SECONDARY OBJECTIVE WILL BE DEVOTED TO EVALUATING THE USE OF PRECIPITATION AND ION EXCHANGE FOR THE REMOVAL OF DU FROM THE SOLVENT FOR SOLVENT REUSE.",

IMPROVEMENTS IN OPERATIONAL LIFETIME WILL RESULT. MCP GAIN INSTABILITY CAN BE CATEGORIZED INTO SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM LOSSES. THE SHORT TERM INSTABILITY IS CAUSED BY ADSORPTION AND DESORPTION OF GAS MOLECULES LOOSELY BOUND ONTO MICROCHANNEL WALLS WHICH CAN BE ELIMINATED BY INITIAL OUTGASSING AND STABLIZIATION PROCEDURES. LONG TERM GAIN INSTABILITY IS MORE SERIOUS AND IS IRREVERSIBLE. IT IS A DIRECT FUNCTION OF ACCUMULATED OUTPUT CHARGE. SEVERAL UNCONFIRMED MECHANISMS HAVE BEEN POSTULATED AS CAUSING THE LONG TERM LOSS. THESE MECHANISMS REDUCE TO A LOSS IN THE SECONDARY ELECTRON EMISSION YIELD, AND/OR A CHANGE IN THE CHANNEL WALL CONDUCTIVITY.

THIS WORK WILL MEASURE CONDUCTIVITY CHANGE WITH PROLONGED MCP OPERATION AND WILL DETERMINE THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THIS CHANGE AND THE SECONDARY YIELD CHANGE IN THE GAIN DEGRADATION PROCESS BY PERFORMING A COMPUTER SIMULATION OF MCP GAIN BEHAVIOR.

THE SULFUR CONTAINING CERIUM COMPOUND WAS REGENERATED SO THAT IT WAS CAPABLE OF AGAIN REACTING WITH THE H2S. IT IS THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSALTO DEMONSTRATE THE EXTENT OF DESULFURIZATION WITH CERIUM OXIDE OVER A RANGE 1472/2192F (800/1200C) AND CO/C02 RATIOS OF TWO TO SIX, AND TO DESULFURIZE AND REGENERATE BACK TO CERIUM OXIDE A NUMBER OF TIMES. PRESENTLY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY FOR DESULFURIZATION OF FUEL GASES WITH OXIDES OF IRON, ZINC, COBALT, ETC. IS LIMITED TO FUEL GASES WITH CO/C02 RATIOS THAT SELDOM EXCEED 1.0 AT TEMPERATURES THAT ARE GENERALLY LESS THAT 1200 (649 ). IT HAS BEEN CALCULATED THAT FUEL GASES PRODUCED IN AN AIR BLOWNGASIFIER AT 1200F A CO/C02 OF ONE AND A CALORIFIC VALUE OF 110 BTU/SCF. IF AN AIR BLOWN GASIFIER IS OPERATED AT 1760F (927C), THE CO/C02 RATIO OF THE FUEL GAS MAY BE AS HIGH AS EIGHT AND THE CALORIFIC VALUE HAS BEEN CALCULATED TOBE 150 BTU/SCF-A 36% INCREASE IN BTU VALUE COMPARED TO THAT OBTAINED BY LOW TEMPERATURE GASIFIER OPERATION. THIS INCREASE IN BTU VALUE OF THE FUEL GAS DUE TO HIGHER TEMPERATURE GASIFIER OPERATION, AND DESULFURIZATION WITH CERIUM OXIDE AT A HIGHER TEMPERATURE, WHICH WOULD INCREASE THE SENSIBLE HEAT IN THE FUEL GAS, SHOULD INCREASE THE OVERALL THERMAL EFFICIENCY OF ANY PROCESS USING FUEL GASES. THE DESULFURIZATION STEP IS A NON-CATALYTIC REACTION BETWEEN THE GAS AND THE SOLID, NON-STOICHIOMETRIC REACTANT: 2CEO(2-X) (S)+H2S(G)+1-2X)H2(G)= CE202S(S)+2(1-X)H20(G). REGENERATION CAN BE SIMPLY REPRESENTED BY THE FOLLOWING: CE202S(S)+202(G)=CE02(S)+S02(G) ALL OF THE CERIUM COMPOUNDS HAVE MELTING POINTS IN EXCESS OF 3000F (1649), AND THEIR CHEMICAL STABILITY IS SUCH THEY CAN NOT BE REDUCED BY FUEL GASES. THE CONCENTRATION OF S02 GIVEN OFF DURING REGENERATION IS HIGH ENOUGH TO BE SUITABLE AS A FEED FOR A CLAUS PLANT. THE RESULTS FROM PHASE I WILL DEFINE THE SULFUR CAPTURE EFFICIENCY OF CERIUM OXIDE OVER A WIDE RANGE OF GAS COMPOSITIONS AND TEMPERATURES, AND CONFIRM THE VALIDITY OF THE PREDICTED REGENERATION PROCESS FOR THE SULFUR-CONTAINING COMPOUNDS BACK TO CERIUM OXIDE. PHASE II WILL PROVIDE THE NECESSARY KINETIC DATA FOR THE DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATING OF A PHASE II PILOT PLANT AND THEEVENTUAL CONSTRUCTION OF A COMMERCIAL DESULFURIZATION UNIT USING THIS TECHNOLOGY. ANY ATTEMPT TO DESIGN A FACILITY USING THIS PROCESS WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE PRIOR TO THE COMPLETION OF PHASE II. FUEL GASES PRODUCED BY COAL GASIFICATION AT HIGH TEMPERATURES AND DESULFURIZED AT HIGH TEMPERATURES, CAN BE USED WITH INCREASED THERMAL EFFICIENCY, AS A FUEL FORM COMBINED CYCLE POWER PLANTS, FUEL CELLS, AND TO AFIRE THE BOILERS OF ELECTRIC POWER GENERATING STATIONS IF THE EPA REQUIREMENTS FOR SULFUR EMISSION FROM SUCH UNITS ARE LOWERED.",

THIS ANTIGEN IS A GENE PRODUCT OF ONE ALLELE OF A BI-ALLELIC SYSTEM HAVING THE OBSERVED DISTRIBUTION OF: PLA1A1=0.69; PLA1A2= 0.28; AND PLA2A2=0.03. EXPOSURE TO THE PLA1 ANTIGEN CAN INDUCE ALLOIMMUNIZATION IN PLA2A2 INDIVIDUALS AFTER PLATELETTRANSFUSIONS OR DURING PREGNANCY IN PLA2A2 MOTHERS CARRYING PLA1A2 INFANTS. THIS ALLOIMMUNIZATION PRODUCES ANTI-PLA1 ANTIBODIES WHICH CAN RESULT IN SEVERE THROMBOCYTOPENIA IN BOTH POST-TRANSFUSION PURPURA OR IN IMMUNE NEONATAL THROMBO-CYTOPENIA. SINCE A LARGE FRACTION OF THE POPULATION IS PLA1A1, THEY MAY, IN A SIMILAR MANNER, DEVELOP ALLOANTI- BODIES TO THE PLA2 ANTIGEN. THIS PROCESS MAY ACCOUNT FOR PATIENTS WHO BECOME REFRACTORY TO PLATELET TRANSFUSION DURING PLATELET SUPPORT THERAPY AND WHO SHOW EVIDENCE OF PLATELET-SPECIFIC ANTIBODIES UNRELATED TO ANTI-HLA SENSITI- ZATION. THEREFORE, THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT CLINICAL USE FOR A SYSTEM WHICH CAN DETECT THE PRESENCE OF THESE SPECIFIC ANTI-PLATELET ANTIBODIES AND DETERMINE THE PHENOTYPE OF RECIPIENTS OF PLATELET TRANSFUSIONS AND OF EXPECTANT MOTHERS. A NEW, SIMPLE, SPECIFIC ASSAY TECHNIQUE FOR DETECTION OF THE ANTI-PLA1 OR -PLA2 ANTIBODIES IN PATIENT SERA HAS BEEN DEVELOPED; USING THE SAME TECHNOLOGY, AN ASSAYFOR QUANTITATION OF THESE TWO ANTIGENS ON PLATELET SURFACES TO DETERMINE THE PLATELET PLA1/A2 PHENOTYPE WAS ESTABLISHED.BOTH ASSAYS USE LABELED, PURIFIED GPIII IN A QUANTITATIVE IMMUNOPRECIPITATION ASSAY. THE PHASE I PLAN OF THIS PRO- POSAL WILL DEVELOP THIS ASSAY INTO A BIOTIN-AVIDIN LINKED SYSTEM HAVING A FORMAT COMPATIBLE WITH EXPANSION TO A COMMERCIAL KIT.

THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THE LAST ISSUE IN TERMS OF PATIENT-CONTROLLED, IONTOPHORETIC DELIVERY OF NARCOTIC AGENTS ON THE BATTLEFIELD. IONTOPHORESIS UTILIZED FOR DRUG DELIVERY HAS A VENERABLE HISTORY YET TO THIS DAY, ITS APPLICATION IS LIMITED TO SHORT PROCEDURES OF 15-30 MINUTES. THE MAJOR IMPEDIMENT TO TREATMENTS LASTING OF THE ORDER OF 6-12 HOURS HAS BEEN THE FORMATION OF ELECTROLYTIC PRODUCTS (H+ IN THE POSITIVE ELECTROD AND OHIN THE NEGATIVE ELECTRODE), WHICH RAPIDLY LOWER THE EFFICIENCY OF DRUG TRANSPORT. THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN ADDRESSED BY OUR GROUP OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS USING MORPHINE AS THE MODEL DRUG. OUR CLINICAL STUDIES HAVE ACHIEVED A DELIVERY OF 5-6 MG FOR OVER TWO HOURS. THE GOALS IN PHSE I OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE: 1) TO PROLONG FURTHER THE DELIVERY TIME OF MORPHINE FROM A SINGLE ELECTRODE-RECEPTACLE; 2) TO INVESTIGATE THE RATE OF SYSTEMIC UPTAKE OF MORPHINE IN PIGS EXSANGUINATED BY 20% AND THEN 30% OF TOTAL BLOOD VOLUMES, EACH ANIMAL ACTING AS ITS OWN CONTROL; AND 3) TO CONSTRUCT A PROTOTYPE, PATIENTCONTROLLED IONTOPHORETIC DRUG DELIVERY UNIT FOR USE IN FIELD CONDITIONS: AN ADHESIVE PATCH CONTAINING MORPHINE, BATTERY SUPPLY AND CURRENT CONTROL. IN PHASE II THIS DEVICE WILL BE REFINED AND INTEGRATED INTO ONE UNIT, PRODUCED IN MUCH LARGER NUMBERS FOR USE IN CLINICAL TRIALS AND THE MORPHINE QUANTITY WILL BE IN GEL, PASTE OR GUM FORM, PRIMARILY TO PREVENT LEAKAGE OF CONTENTS BEFORE, DURING OR AFTER CLINICAL APPLICATION.",

SOME OF THE BASIC PRINCIPLES IN THIS ENCLOSURE DESIGN HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN SMALL TEST CELLS, BUT SCALING THE TECHNIQUES TO A FULL-SIZE PANEL INVOLVES RESEARCH ON MATERIALS, WELDING, AND OTHER FABRICATION PROBLEMS THAT ARE CONSTRAINED BY THE PHYSICS OF THE DISPLAY TECHNOLOGY. THE ADVANTAGES OF THIS FLAT-PANEL CONCEPT INCLUDE THE FACT THAT IT CAN BE MOUNTED ON THE WALL,YET HAVE AN IMAGE AREA LARGE ENOUGH TO DISPLAY TWO LIFE- SIZE BODY IMAGES AT ONCE. IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO DISPLAY MULTIPLE IMAGES FOR IMMEDIATE COMPARISON AND CORRELATION OR TO ADD NOTATIONS OR TO DISPLAY OTHER MONITORED DATA SIMULTANEOUSLY. EXPERIMENTAL WORK ON THE PHASE I ENCLOSURE PROTOTYPE WILL ANTICIPATE A WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTION CONCERNS FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE FULL-SIZE COLOR PANEL IN PHASE II.",

SUCH DRUGS, PRIMARILY OF THE AMPHETAMINE CLASS, HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO PROVIDE ONLY MODEST WEIGHT REDUCTION OVER THE SHORT TERM.IN ADDITION, THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IS MITIGATED BY REBOUND EATING, ABUSE, AND ADDICTION. THE NEUROPHARMACOLOGY OF APPETITE AND SATIETY ARE JUST BEGINNING TO BE UNDERSTOOD AT THE MOLECULAR LEVEL, AND THE NUMBER OF POTENTIAL PHARMACO- LOGIC MEANS TO ALTER FEEDING BEHAVIOR HAS INCREASED ACCORD- INGLY. ENHANCEMENT OF APPETITE BY NEWLY DISCOVERED NEURO- PEPTIDES, FOR EXAMPLE, MUST AWAIT THE DISCOVERY OF BIOAVAILABLE NONPEPTIDE AGENTS. OF SEVERAL CENTRAL MECHANISMS FOR CONTROLLING APPETITE AND FEEDING, THERE IS CONSIDERABLE EVIDENCE THAT THE OPIOID SYSTEM PLAYS A MAJOR ROLE. THE EXPANDING BODY OF PHARMACOLOGICAL DATA PERTAININGTO OPIATES SUGGESTS A CLEAR NOVEL APPROACH TO A SAFE APPETITE SUPPRESSANT. SEVERAL EXISTING OPIATE ANTAGONISTS INHIBIT FEEDING, ALTHOUGH THE AVAILABLE ONES MAY PRODUCE ANYCOMBINATION OF SHORT ACTION, TOLERANCE, OR DYSPHORIA. HOWEVER, AS INDIVIDUAL ANTAGONISTS HAVE ONE OR ANOTHER USEFUL PROPERTY, THE DESIGN OF OPIATE ANTAGONISTS WITH SUPERIOR CHARACTERISTICS SHOULD BE POSSIBLE. INFORMED BY STRATEGIES FROM OPIATE RECEPTOR PHARMACOLOGY, NOVA IS IN THEPROCESS OF SYNTHESIZING A SERIES OF NOVEL OPIATE ANTAGONISTSLED BY A PROPRIETARY COMPOUND DESIGNATED NPC-168. PHASE I SUPPORT WILL ESTABLISH AND CARRY OUT MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY AND FEEDING TRIALS OF SEVERAL SUCH COMPOUNDS, WHICH WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR EVALUATION FOR THE PHASE I GRANT PERIOD. SUCCESSFUL COMPOUNDS THAT PASS THIS SCREEN WILL THEN BE MOREVIGOROUSLY EVALUATED (PHASE II) FOR SUCH PARAMETERS AS TOLERANCE, METABOLIC ALTERATIONS, AND ACUTE AND CHRONIC TOXICITY.",

THE ICBM DEEP BASING GAS PROPELLED LAUNCHER FEASIBILITY DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM WOULD BE MONITORED FOR APPLICABLE DATA. IN PARTICULAR, THE ANALYSIS WOULD EXAMINE IN DETAIL A VARIETY OF OFFVEHICLE LAUNCH DYNAMICS INCLUDING 45 DEG. THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS WOULD BE THE BASIS TO LAYOUT A DETAILED TEST PLAN FOR PHASE II. THE PHASE II WOULD CONTAIN A LARGE AMOUNT OF TESTING ON A LARGE NTS CENTRIFUGE. THIS TESTING WOULD INCLUDE THE LAUNCH TUBE/CANISTER AND CANISTER/MISSILE DYNAMICS. THE REASON FOR THE CENTRIFUGE IS TO ENSURE THE EFFECTS OF GRAVITY ARE CORRECTLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE TEST SITUATION OF A SCALED VERSION OF HARDWARE.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE POSSIBILITY OF A WORKING LABORATORY MODEL OF AN ELECTRICAL PULSER CAPABLE OF GENERATING KILOVOLT AMPLITUDE PULSES OF 100 PICOSECOND OR LESS AT A REPETITION RATE OF 500 HZ. WE PROPOSE TO ACHIEVE THIS BY UTILISING A Q-SWITCHED MODE LOCKED LASER TO CONTROL A SEMICONDUCTOR SWITCH CONNECTED TO A HIGH VOLTAGE LINE. IT IS DEMONSTRATED THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO GENERATE 1KV PULSES IN 250-350 PICOSECONDS DURATION AT A REPETITION RATE OF 500 HZ. THE AMPLITUDE JITTER IN THE PULSES ARE VERY SMALL AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SUCH PULSES CAN BE VIEWED ON A SAMPLING SCOPE. THE PROPOSAL OUTLINES VARIOUS WAYS OF REDUCING PULSE WIDTHS FOR EXISTING LASER SYSTEMS. ALTERNATE APPROACHES OF ACHIEVING THE SAME GOAL WITH LASER DIODES IS ALSO OUTLINED.",

        "abstract": "CONVENTIONAL LINEAR ACCELERATORS ARE POWERED BY KLYSTRONS AND ARE LIMITED IN ACCELERATION GRADIENTS TO BETWEEN 50 AND 100 MEV/M. FUTURE GENERATIONS OF HIGH ENERGY LINEAR COLLIDERS MAY REQUIRE HIGH POWER COHERENT RADIATION SOURCES WITH WAVELENGTHS OF THREE CENTIMETERS AND LOWER. ONE POSSIBLE GENERATOR OF TUNABLE COHERENT RADIATION IN THESE WAVELENGTHS IS THE FREE ELECTRON LASER (FEL). INTEREST IN THE INTERMEDIATE ENERGY ELECTRON COOLING OF ANTIPROTON SOURCES HAS ENABLED THE NATIONAL ELECTROSTATICS CORPORATION (NEC) TO BEGIN DEVELOPMENT OF A 4 AMPERE, 3 MEV RECIRCULATING ELECTRON BEAM SYSTEM APPROPRIATE FOR DC FEL OPERATION. THE ADVANTAGES OF THIS SYSTEM ARE HIGH BEAM QUALITY, HIGH AVERAGE POWER, AND HIGH EFFICIENCY. THIS SYSTEM, WITH A MODIFICATION TO ALLOW A 50 KEV ENERGY LOSS INTHE RECIRCULATING BEAM, COULD PUMP A WAVEGUIDE CONTINUOUSLY AT 200 KW. BY USING MIRRORS TO FORM AN OPTICAL CAVITY, ENERGY CAN BE STORED. USING Q SWITCHING TECHNIQUES THIS ENERGY CAN BE PULSED OUT OF THE CAVITY QUICKLY, RESULTING INVERY HIGH PEAK POWER. ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING TYPES OF NEW ACCELERATOR IS THE PLASMA BEATWAVE ACCELERATOR. A TWO FREQUENCY FEL MIGHT PROVIDE THE LASER DRIVER FOR SUCH AN ACCELERATOR POTENTIALLY YIELDING ACCELERATING GRADIENTS IN EXCESS OF 1 GEV PER METER. THE CONTRACTOR PROPOSES TO DESIGN AND TEST A MULTISTAGE ELECTRON BEAM COLLECTOR CAPABLE OF COLLECTING A WIDE RANGE OF ELECTRON ENERGIES. SUCCESSFUL OPERATION OF THE DEVICE WILL PROVE THE FEASIBILITY OF A TWO FREQUENCY FEL POWER SOURCE FOR FUTURE ACCELERATION TECHNIQUES.",

THE IDEA OF NETWORKING IS CENTRAL TO SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM STRATEGIES FOR DIFFUSING AND IMPLEMENTING PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS AS WELL ASA VARIETY OF OTHER SERVICE PROGRAMS. A TOOL TO BETTER ASSESS AND MANAGE SUCH PROGRAMS WOULD APPEAL TO A WIDE RANGEOF ANALYSTS AND ADMINISTRATORS AT NATIONAL, STATE, AND LOCALLEVELS.",

THE RESULTING INCREASED RISK OF ENEMY DETECTION FROM DIRECT-INJECTION MILITARY DIESELS PLACES A HIGH VALUE ON METHODS OF REDUCING THE COMBUSTION NOISE. WILLIAM C. PFEFFERLE ASSOCIATES (WCP) HAS INVENTED A PROPRIETARY CATALYTICALLY-ENHANCED MODIFICATION OF A DIESEL ENGINE WHICH OFFERS A NUMBER OF PROMISING FEATURES, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANTLY-REDUCED COMBUSTION NOISE LEVELS. USING CATALYSTS PLACED PERMANENTLY IN THE COMBUSTION CHAMBER OF A DIESEL ENGINE, WCP HAS DEMONSTRATED RAPID CONSTANT-VOLUME COMBUSTION OF DIESEL FUEL ACCOMPANIED BY A NOTICEABLY-LOWER NOISE LEVEL (CONFIRMED BY A PRESSURETRACE WITHOUT HIGH FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS) AND A COMBUSTION CHAMBER FREE OF VISIBLE SOOT. WE BELIEVE THIS SYSTEM CAN INEXPENSIVELY BUT SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NOISE EMISSIONS IN FIELD DIESEL GENERATORS (AS WELL AS OTHER MILITARY DIESELS) WHILE IMPROVING FUEL ECONOMY AND POWER AND ALSO OFFERING OTHER IMPORTANT ADVANTAGES NOT WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS RFP.

AFTER SYNTHESIS OF THE THREE CHELATING AGENTS, AND DEVELOPMENT OF SUITABLE ANALYTICAL SYSTEMS, STABILITY AND RELEASE OF THE CORRESPONDING POLAR AGENTS WILL BE STUDIED IN BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS IN VITRO.

THE DIAGNOSTIC UTILIZES THE TECHNIQUE OF OPTICAL-INFRARED DOUBLE RESONANCE TO OBSERVE BEAM INTENSITIES. IN THIS TECHNIQUE, THE OUTPUT OF A MWIR CHEMICAL LASER (DF) IS COMBINED WITH THE OUTPUT OF A VISIBLE/UV PROBE LASER TO PRODUCE OR MODULATE THE FLUORESCENCE OF A SIMPLE DIATOMIC MOLECULE SEEDED IN A GAS FLOW THROUGH WHICH THE LASER PROPAGATES. THE INTENSITY OF THE FLUORESCENCE IS LINEARLY PROPORTIONAL TO EACH OF THE LASER INTENSITIES. THE OVERLAP OF THE IR AND PROBE BEAMS DEFINES A CROSS SECTION OF THE IR BEAM, WHICH IS IMAGED ON TO A TWO-DIMENSIONAL INTENSIFIED ARRAY WITH 1 PERCENT SPATIAL RESOLUTION. TEMPORAL RESOLUTION IS DETERMINED BY THE LENGTH OF THE PROBE LASER PULSE (15 NS).AN ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE LAMINAR FLOW JET WILL SEED THE MOLECULE TO BE EXCITED INTO THE GAS STREAM. PHASE I RESEARCH WILL SELECT FROM MANY POSSIBLE IMAGING MOLECULES AND PERFORM EXCITATION AND QUENCHING MEASUREMENTS TO DETERMINE OPTIMUM CANDIDATES. A RAMAN-SHIFTED PULSED DYE LASER WILL BE USED TO SIMULATE THE PEAK POWER OUTPUT OF A CW DF CHEMICAL LASER. A SECOND DYE LASER WILL BE USED AS THE PROBE LASER.

PLASMA HEATING IS ACCOMPLISHED BY A DC DISCHARGE BETWEEN THE TWO ANODES LOCATED INSIDE THE MAGNETIC NOZZLE COILS AND A DOWNSTREAM HOLLOW CATHODE WHICH IS LOCATED ON A MAGNETIC FIELD LINE THAT PASSES NEAR THE CENTER LINE OF THE ANODES. MOST OF THE PROPELLANT IS INJECTED INTO THE DISCHARGE THROUGH THE ANODES. THIS THRUSTER CONCEPT BUILDS DIRECTLY ON BOTH THE BEST OF THE MAGNETOPLASMADYNAMIC (MPD) THRUSTER AND EXISTING STELLARATOR TECHNOLOGY.

CHAMUEI = I9S4) CAPABLE OF DETERMINING IN REAL TIME THE PRESENCE, LOCATION, NUMBER, AND SIZE OF DEFECTS PRESENT ALONG A LINEAR PATH ON THE SURFACE OF A CONDUCTIVE MATERIAL UNDER TEST PIPES, TUBES, PLATES) WITH A CONTACTLESS SENSOR. THE SENSOR CONSISTS OF A MAGNETOSTRICTIVE DELAY LINE PLACED IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE SURFACE TO BE INSPECTED. A CURRENT CARRYING WIRE PLACED ADJACENT AND PARALLEL TO THE DELAY LINE IS USED TO INDUCE EDDY CURRENTS IN THE MATERIAL. THE PRESENCE OF A FLAW IN THE MATERIAL CREATES TRANSVERSE EDDY CURRENTS. THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD OF THE TRANSVERSE EDDY CURRENT COMPONENTS INTERACTS LOCALLYWITH THE MAGNETOSTRICTIVE DELAY LINE LAUNCHING ULTRASONIC WAVES IN THE DELAY LINE. PULSED ULTRASONIC WAVES ARE GENERATED BY USING PULSED ELECTRICAL CURRENTS IN THE CURRENT CARRYING WIRE. THE ULTRASONIC WAVES ORIGINATE AT THE FLAW EDGES LOCATIONS ALONG THE DELAY LINE. SRATIAL INFORMATION REGARDING FLAW EDGE LOCATIONS IS PRESERVED IN THE TIME INFORMATION OF THE ULTRASONIC WAVES PROPAGATING IN THE DELAY LINE. AN ULTRASONIC RECEIVER COUPLED TO THE DELAY LINE IS USED TO DETECT THE TRAVELING WAVES. THE NUMBER OF ULTRASONIC PULSES INCREASES AS THE NUMBER OF FLAWS INCREASES.

THE LOCATION OF A CRACK IS DETERMINED FROM THE TIME OF ARRIVAL OF THE CORRESPONDING ULTRASONIC PULSE IN THE DELAY LINE.

CURRENTLY USED COMPENSATION TECHNIQUES - RADOME TAILORING AND ERROR MAPPING - ARE EXPENSIVE, TIME CONSUMING, LIMITED IN APPLICATION TO NARROWBAND SYSTEMS, AND CANNOT ACCOUNT FOR IN-FLIGHT VARIATIONS DUE TO HEATING, ABLATION, ETC. SPARTA PROPOSES TO DEVELOP A TECHNIQUE FOR REAL-TIME ESTIMATION AND COMPENSATION OF RADOME ERRORS. A CAREFULLY DESIGNED SINUSOIDAL STIMULUS IS INJECTED INTO THE HOMING LOOP AND RADOME ERROR SLOPES ARE ESTIMATED FROM THE RESULTING OSCILLATIONS IN THE MEASURED BORESIGHT ERRORS. THE COMPENSATION SIGNAL IS GENERATED FROM THIS ESTIMATE AND APPLIED TO THE SEEKER TRACK LOOP. SINCE THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUE ESTIMATES RADOME ERRORS IN REAL-TIME, THE COMPENSATION SCHEME IS ADAPTIVE TO VARIATIONS IN RADOME ERRORS. COMPUTER SIMULATION OF A HOMING SYSTEM WILL BE UTILIZED TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PROPOSED ESTIMATION AND COMPENSATION SCHEMES, AND TO STUDY THE SENSITIVITY OF THE PERFORMANCE TO VARIOUS PARAMETERS.",

MUCH OF THAT TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN DEVELOPED BY THE OFFERER OF THIS PROPOSAL DURING THE PAST FEW YEARS. SHUTTERED VIDEO BRINGS TOGETHER THE BEST FEATURES OF CONVENTIONAL FILM TECHNIQUES (PHOTOGRAPHIC CAMERAS) AND VIDEO TAPE TECHNIQUES (ELECTRONIC CAMERAS) WHILE AVOIDING CERTAIN DISADVANTAGES OF BOTH. THE PRIMARY ADVANTAGES OFFERED BY EXISTING SHUTTERED VIDEO CAMERAS ARE THE CLARITY OF THE FILM-BASED CAMERAS IN SLOW OR STOP MOTION REPLAY AND THE REAL-TIME VIEWING CAPABILITY OF CONVENTIONAL VIDEO CAMERAS. SHUTTERED VIDEO CAMERAS CURRENTLY IN USE ARE STILL TOO LARGE AND CUMBERSOME FOR MANY APPLICATIONS, ESPECIALLY SOME MILITARY APPLICATIONS WHERE WEIGHT, SIZE AND RUGGEDNESS ARE CRITICAL.",

SEVERAL FACTORS WHICH MAKE THESE COMPOUNDS SUITABLE CANDIDATES WERE EXAMINED WITH THE CONCLUSION THAT SULFUR HEXAFLUORIDE (SF6) WAS RECOMMENDED ASSUITABLE SURROGATE FOR INDICATING THE DRE OF INCINERATORS FOR POHC COMPOUNDS. THE MAJOR DRAWBACK TO EPA ACCEPTING THE METHODOLOGY AS A TOOL IS THE LACK OF DATA CORRELATING THE POHC DRE'S WITH THOSE OF SF6. TRACER TECHNOLOGIES PROPOSES APHASE I PROGRAM TO CORRELATE SEVERAL POHC DRE'S WITH SF6 DREUNDER A VARIETY OF LABORATORY CONDITIONS. SHOULD THE TECH- NIQUE CONTINUE TO PROVE A SATISFACTORY METHOD, A PHASE II PROGRAM COULD BE INITIATED WHICH WOULD LEAD TO THE DEVELOP- MENT OF AN ECONOMICAL PROTOTYPE TEST SYSTEM WHICH COULD BE INSTALLED AND OPERATED ON A CONTINUOUS, REAL TIME BASIS. THESYSTEM WOULD ALSO BE TESTED ON INDUSTRIAL SIZED INCINERATORSDURING THE PHASE II PROGRAM EFFORT.",

THE RESPONSE OF MATERIALS TO THIS ENVIRONMENT INCLUDES HIGH STRESSES, RADIATION DAMAGE, AND SURFACE EROSION RESULTING FROM SPUTTERING BY PLASMA PARTICLES. WHILE BARE CARBON IS PRESENTLY USED AS THE LOW ZPLASMA FACING MATERIAL IN SOME TOROIDAL MACHINES, IT IS NOT REACTOR RELEVANT BECAUSE OF A HIGH TRITIUM PERMEATION.

A READILY METABOLIZED, NONTOXIC FLUID IS USED AS THE CHARGING MEDIUM, AND THE DEVICES THEMSELVES ARE FAB- RICATED FROM SILICONE RUBBER WITH AN INTEGRALLY TEXTURED SURFACE BEING SEPARATELY DEVELOPED. A SERIES OF 18 ANIMAL EXPERIMENTS ARE TO BE USED TO (1) EXAMINE HEALING AROUND THEDEVICES UNDER A WIDE RANGE OF VOLUME AND FIRMNESS; (2) EVALUATE THE SUITABILITY OF THE PERCUTANEOUS FILLING SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN DESIGNED; AND (3) EVALUATE THE VOLUME STABILITY OF THE IMPLANTED DEVICES. BECAUSE THE TISSUE CAPSULE THICKNESS AROUND THE DEVICES IS CONTROLLED, THE TACTILE SURFACE AND VOLUME OF THE IMPLANTED DEVICES SHOULD BE READILY ADJUSTABLE TO COMPENSATE FOR LATE TISSUE CHANGES OR CONTINUED THERAPY.",

THIS OBJECTIVE IS ACCOMPLISHED BY PROVIDING A POROUS, FABRIC COLLECTING SURFACE. A SMALL PORTION (TYPICALLY LESS THAN 20%) OF THE DIRTY GAS STREAM IS DRAWN THROUGH THE COLLECTED DUST CAKE AND THE POROUS COLLECTING PLATE BY A SEPARATE FAN. THIS SMALL FLOW THROUGH THE DUST PROVIDES AN AERODYNAMIC FORCE TOREDUCE RE-ENTRAINMENT OF THE DUST. IT IS FELT THAT THE REP WILL HAVE THE FOLLOWING ADVANTAGES OVER FABRIC FILTERS AND ESP'S FOR HTHP APPLICATION. 1. NO METAL COLLECTING PLATES OR METAL RAPPING MECHANISMS TO WARP OR FATIGUE TO FAILURE AS IN THE CASE OF THE ESP. 2. APPROXIMATELY 80% LESS EXPENSIVE FILTER FABRIC USED IN THE REP THAN HTHP BAGHOUSES. 3. SMALLER OVERALL SIZE MEANS SMALLER HIGH PRESSURE VESSEL IS NEEDED FOR HOUSING.
