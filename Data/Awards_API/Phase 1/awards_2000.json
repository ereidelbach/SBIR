ULDB objectives include developing a low-cost, integrated system capable of supporting operations above 100,000 feet for durations as long as 100 days. The ULDB power system must provide up to 2 kW for missions from polar to equatorial latitudes. Global Aerospace Corporation has examined power generation subsystem alternatives and has developed an innovative design which is lightweight and meets the requirements with a very low mass and cost. \n\nThe major innovations proposed are: \n\n* Concept for two-axis Sun pointing which does not require rotation, \n* Lightweight mechanism for deploying and restowing a solar array, and \n* Lightweight solar array based upon solar-powered unmanned aerial vehicle programs.

        "abstract": "Not Available DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prenatal exposure to alcohol is the leading causing of birth defects in the United States. Recent studies show prevalence rates in the US may be as high as 1% of live births (Burd L, Cotsonas-Hassler, et al., 2003). This means that each year, as many as 39,000 babies are born with FAS. Many more are born with fetal alcohol effects (FAE). Early diagnosis and appropriate management has repeatedly been shown to significantly reduce the risk of secondary disabilities and increase positive outcomes (Streissguth et al. 1997). AEI is developing a set of multimedia and web components about FAS that target lay care providers, particularly foster and adoptive parents. The project seeks to increase early and accurate diagnosis of children exposed to alcohol prenatally and to facilitate appropriate treatment and ongoing management of those affected by the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and its associated disorders. \nPhase I resoundingly met its technical and evaluative tests of feasibility, going well beyond the originally envisioned deliverables. Phase I produced a commercial quality CD-ROM that focused on helping lay care providers recognize problems and seek diagnosis. This CD-ROM was examined in a randomized, controlled field trial and was found to increase subject knowledge of FAS significantly more than the comparison condition. The program was also considered by subjects to be better than the comparison condition on measures of usefulness, effect on confidence, and usability. The program surpassed the experimentally postulated values for all usability measures. Qualitative feedback further supported success of the project. The Phase I FAS Multimedia Guide and the results of the evaluation strongly support continuance to Phase II. Phase II of the project will continue this effort by (1) creating a significant new module on treatment and management, (2) revising and extending the Phase I module, (3) enhancing and extending the Phase I web site, (4) creating VMS and DVD versions for wider distribution of the core materials. Evaluation will be conducted through (1) subject matter expert reviews, (2) end-user focus groups, and (3) a quasi-experimental field trial, and (4) commercializing the products from Phases I and II through parent associations, distributors, and state agencies.",

The Phase I Research will demonstrate the utility of HPEK-based systems by combining them with micromachined structures to effectively translate the high pressure hydraulic flow into usable work. Specific applications are outlined which can employ HPEK technology, including an ultra-compact rock crushing device. The key actuator system for this device will be constructed and tested in order to assess the feasibility for use in sample retrieval and handling systems.",

ITN believes that producing a lightweight, cost-effective SAR requires revolutionary approaches and, therefore, we propose a totally new SAR concept, consisting of a flexible antenna blanket with intrinsic structure, thermal control, power and RF distribution functionality. This Multifunctional Structure offers an elegant solution for SAR missions. As with all new ideas, this concept presents an element of technical risk; however, this risk is offset by its high payoff, making our concept perfectly suited for investigation under NASA\"s SBIR program.",

This enhancement, coupled with an anthropomorphically-correct 6-DOF camera manipulator and a stereoscopic HMD, promises to alleviate most of the eye strain and nausea associated with fixed vergence camera systems. An additional improvement proposed is one that overlays the live video signals with graphics that are extracted from the observed scene. Edge detection and structured visual cues will present more information about the remote surroundings when the environment is visually occluded by dust particles or low light conditions. The proposed enhancements combine to offer a greater level of immersion with a telerobotic interface that is presently available with extant systems.",

        "abstract": "Commercial satellite services provide a convenient mechanism for over-the-horizon communications among ships, aircraft, and on-shore information sources.  The Coast Guard has identified the potential of maritime Web and messaging (e-mail) applications implemented over commercial satellite links to subtantially increase the effectiveness of Coast Guard operations.  However, there are two major impediments to the widespread deployment of this technology today, i.e., high operational costs and poor performance of the TCP/IP protocol over satellite links.  The Phase I SBIR effort designed an innovative software solution, called MobiWeb, to address these problems.  MobiWeb delivers the following benefits:  1.. Savings in operating costs of up to 95% for Coast Guard Web applications implemented over commercial satellite services; 2.  Pervasive connectivity between offshore  and onshore networks enabling real-time messaging between mobile clients and fixed network resources, as welll as between mobile clients; 3.  Tunalbe TCP/IP stack that significantly speeds Web page accesses compared to existing TCP/IP implementations; 4.Full compatibility with existing Web servers and browsers.  The Phase II effort will build a prototype of MobiWeb and demonstrate its capabilities for cost-effective and efficient implementation of satellite-based Web and e-mail applications for the Coast Guard",

Over the past four years, BioTex has developed the Visualase(r) thermal therapy system for treatment of localized cancers by using temperature-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to precisely control the delivery of laser energy and the extent of tissue destruction.  \nThe current primary target applications for this system are small focal secondary or metastatic tumors in the brain and localized cancer in the prostate. Secondary applications include treatment of metastatic lesions in vertebral bodies, and unresectable liver tumors. Approximately 40,900 primary brain tumors and over 100,000 metastatic brain tumors will be diagnosed this year in the U.S. Additionally, 190,000 American men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer, and over 30,000 will die from the disease. Of the 1.3 million patients who will be diagnosed with cancer this year (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers), approximately 5-10% will develop problematic secondary metastatic tumors in the spine which will require intervention.  \nIn the first year of the proposed study, we will engage in pre-clinical studies and administrative activities required for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of an investigative device exemption (IDE). In the second and third years, we will conduct a Phase I clinical trial to explore the safety and utility of the Visualase system for treatment of patients will small focal metastatic brain tumors, particularly those which are deep-seated or otherwise inoperable. At the end of this study, we will have explored the clinical feasibility and safety of intracerebral laser therapy for treatment of small focal metastatic lesions, and we will have advanced the Visualase system and components to a feature and production level appropriate for 510(k) pre-market approval. This combination of stereotactic laser thermal therapy with real-time MRI will facilitate an unprecedented integration of the diagnostic and therapeutic environments.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   We propose to extend our successful development of an agile spectral light source for light microscopy, funded through the NCI-IMAT initiative, into FDA trials. The SpectraLamp(tm) device enables the automated and quantitative analysis of double-immunostained samples in brightfield (non-fluorescence-based) microscopy, with particular utility for hematopathology applications. A clinically compelling area is the enumeration of malignant blasts in bone marrow biopsy specimens of patients with acute leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myleloproliferative diseases for the purpose of staging and evaluating therapeutic responses. Current methods are inadequate due to poor sampling (typical of bone marrow aspirates) or difficulty in identifying true blasts (bone marrow biopsies and single-color immunohistochemical phenotyping). Double-immunophenotyping permits largely unambiguous detection, but such labeling strategies are not supported by standard (non-multispectral) color imaging systems. To overcome this limitation, we will combine our multispectral imaging system with a high-speed slide-scanning platform that can scan an entire bone-marrow biopsy at high resolution in under 3 minutes. Machine-learning software tools and spectral imaging will identify blasts, combining morphology parameters and double or even triple immunophenotyping to ensure accuracy and precision. After blasts are identified, flow-cytometrylike software will present the data in histograms and other modalities, allowing the user to \"gate\" on particular cellular populations and pull up panels of cell images for confirmation.  \n  \nTime-line: Final equipment-related tasks will be accomplished in the first year and preliminary testing of the instrumentation and software features will occur in the second year, as will development of qualified panels of immunoreagents and staining protocols (by DAKOCytomation). FDA-sanctioned clinical trials will be conducted in the third year, leading to submission of an application for a 510(k) clearance.",

Also, higher switching speeds can reduce the size and mass of components and power modules. Under Phase I, transistors with isolation voltages of up to 100 V will be tested to manage the 28\u00bf4 V unregulated satellite bus. Phase II effort will concentrate on designing a family of scaleable devices and power management subsystems which are capable of 10\u00bfs of amperes absolute current, 100 to >2000 V breakdown, >1000 A/\u00bfs slew rate, and/or >500 kHz frequency switching.",

The devices are based on thin-film structural phase-change memory materials, related to those currently used in rewriteble optical disks. Prototype devices have already demonstrated extended programming endurance (in excess of 1013 cycles), low voltage operation ( < 3 V), and high programming speed (less than 50 nsec). Research proposed for Phase I will investigate the scaling of programming energy with device size and demonstrate operational test structures suitable for integration into memory arrays using 0.18 micrometer photolithography.",

The technique offers low noise, great sensitivity, wide dynamic range, low power consumption, and small size. NASA requires a small telerobotic flying camera for ISS inspection by the crew. Amain's new camera technology offers less power and smaller size for both the imager and the display than previous technologies. Using the most popular analog to digital conversion technique in use today, Sigma Delta, Amain is the first company to consider its use for digital camera systems.",

        "abstract": "Not Available Advanced detectors and detector arrays for high energy sensing can significantly benefit from the availability of small, low-noise, wire bondable resistors with less than 4% resistance changes from room temperature to 1 K. Similarly resistor arrays can reduce the bulk and simplify the circuitary in high energy detector arrays. Currently, the real estate needed for the resistors is large and the reliability over large temperature range is low. This effort seeks to develop resistors that overcome these limitations. Phase I will establish the proof-of-concept.",

Open ocean exchanges of ballast water outside the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in waters greater than 2000 meters deep is the primary method used to reduce this threat.  To verify that ballast exchange has occurred, the United States Coast Guard needs tools capable of differentiating coastal from oceanic water.  A tool that is capable of simultaneously measuring both salinity and dissolved organic matter (DOM) will be developed as part of the proposed research program.  These measurements make it possible to clearly distinguish coastal from oceanic water.",

For spaceborne applications, there are two primary goals. One is to develop space qualifiable packaging techniques for the spatial light modulators (SLMs). The other is to develop low power, high density integrated modules for the system electronics since system volume is primarily driven by these components. During Phase I a spaceborne OCS using 512 x 512 multi-level SLMs will be designed to provide navigational data of the platform relative to a mother ship. Initial design and trade studies for developing compact, low power drivers will be performed. Environmental data will be gathered on the current SLM and analyzed for necessary package changes. During Phase II the Phase I system design will be implemented to produce a space qualifiable OCS.",

Once fully developed , the proposed technical strategy will replace both the Sabatier reaction and subsequent water electrocatalysis steps currently used for spacecraft atmospheric carbon dioxide control. This approach will be simpler, more efficient and less expensive than the current strategy.",

In Phase I, commercially available aluminum nitride substrates will be metallized with a suitable high temperature metallization. Silicon carbide die will be bonded to the metallized substrate via brazing. Die to package interconnection will be done by wire bonding. Test vehicles will be fabricated to evaluate high temperature stability of the substrate metallization, die attach, and wire bonding systems. Electron microscopy and electron spectroscopy will be used to characterize the interfaces between dissimilar components.",

The effort will not only help launch a U.S. based commercial source of these advanced materials, the nanoscale form of these powders will also enable rapid processing of these advanced materials into useful shapes. Phase I would establish the proof-of-concept by producing HfC nanostructured powders and processing them. Phase II will optimize the proposed technology, bulk produce refractory powders, develop and test prototypes with lead customers. Phase III will commercialize the technology.",

Although, current Ni-LaNi5 type hydride battery already hits the energy density of 67 Wh/kg and life of 300 cycles, Nanomaterials Research Corporation (NRC) seeks to develop and demonstrate Ni-Mg batteries with more than 300 Wh/kg energy density using innovative materials and surface engineering.

Availability of this type of equipment is primarily required in very small Earth orbiting satellites. Such transponders transmit and receive commands and data to and from Earth, or in certain situations from or between other satellites. Development of a transponder such as this is considered innovative due to the lack of any known commercial source for space qualified telemetry equipment that can fulfill this need with the attributes required for very small Earth orbiting satellites. These include a high scale of integration, a very low mass and volume, a high level of power efficiency, and the ability to operate from low voltage supplies of 3 to 7 VDC.",

ATU will sputter coat the film to protect it from space environment effects and use tape bonding techniques with tear stop filament reinforcement to seam web segments together. The material will be: highly reflective to solar radiation, thermally stable, tear resistant, and resist AO and UV degradation. This material will be capable of being fabricated into very large area sails.",

NASA needs this pump to circulate coolant in life support systems used in space suites for extravehicular operations. Reliability is high because (1) there are no sliding or dynamic seals, and (2) the pump is so compact that a backup pump could be installed in the suit\u00bfs backpack if desired. High flow capacity leads to improved cooling for increased human comfort in the space environment. The overall objective is to fabricate, test, and deliver a prototype coolant pump to NASA for integration into a functional EVA system. The objectives of Phase I are to prove feasibility by fabricating and testing a model piezoelectric drive system.",

Furthermore, high-speed or targets can produce substantial Doppler shifts (6 to 7 GHz at 2 mm for a typical spaceborne global wind monitoring scenario). These Doppler shifts exceed current state-of-the-art 2 mm detector technology. A common proposed technique for coping with these large Doppler shifts is to utilize an offset-locked optical local oscillator. However, this approach is complex and may not be needed if high-efficiency wideband photoreceivers can be developed. In this Phase I/II effort we propose to develop high-efficiency wideband (",

Vacuum and radiation insulation provide a means to almost eliminate heat losses from the furnace, allowing high temperatures to be achieved using low power. A cylindrical configuration provides strength, access, simplicity, and low mass. Vacuum pumping requirements are minimized by using the partial vacuum of space. Temperatures in excess of 1200oC can be achieved using less than 1 kW of power. Direct optical access will be included in the furnace design. The furnace has the potential to be a centerpiece for research and development of materials processing in space. Phase 1 will demonstrate design and operating principles; Phase 2 will develop and deliver a prototype to NASA.",

        "abstract": "Not Available Active magnetic bearings (AMB) make potential revolutionary Flywheel Energy Storage Systems (FESS) designs possible. However, their inability to sustain and operate through transients is limited. Since bearing reliability, size and weight are crucial in space based FESS, a durable, compact high-speed touchdown bearing is needed. A lightweight Zero Clearance Auxiliary Bearing (ZCAB) suitable for high-speed operation is proposed to meet this need. MiTi has already demonstrated a ZCAB at speeds to 10,000 rpm under 14-g shock loads and simulated AMB failure. Under this program MiTi will 1) establish a preliminary design of a light-weight, high-speed ZCAB suitable for vacuum operation; 2) select the key materials and lubricants for the ZCAB; 3) Establish the Phase II preliminary test rig designs to qualify the ZCAB at high speed; and 4) Prepare a final report.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate regenerable plant supports from inedible plant fiber for use in Advanced Life Support (ALS) System plant growing units. Plant supports of interest include seed plugs, seeding mats, root/shoot barriers, and plant fences. The innovation is to develop totally regenerable plant structures that retain sufficient structural integrity for plant support over one crop cycle, that can be fabricated on-site, are non-toxic to plants, and which do not require separation from the inedible plant waste stream. By forming expendable components from inedible plant material already in the ALS system, resupply mass can be significantly reduced (an annual supply of non-regenerable seed plugs is about 124 to 3000 kg depending on the type). Harvesting procedures would be simplified since support structures would be processed directly as part of the inedible waste stream. The use of regenerable seed plugs would also reduce crew time, and simplify the mechanization of seeding and harvesting processes. Proposal tasks involve processing plant fibers, fabrication of prototypes, and mechanical and biocompatibility testing of the prototype regenerable seed plugs. The anticipated result of this project is a process and associated technology to produce regenerable plant supports meeting ALS operational requirements.",

        "abstract": "ORBITEC proposes to conduct innovative research and development that would culminate in an Aerodynamic Fluid Physics Research Facility (AFPRF) technology demonstration on the International Space Station serving one or more critical experimental needs of the NASA mg Program. The AFPRF would serve as an innovative microgravity apparatus that would virtually eliminate g-jitter and provide a gently controlled acceleration environment. The innovation is based on: the use of a new type of gas-flow generator, an expert system software architecture concept, a non-contact approach for on-orbit position control of spherical liquid samples, and a non-contact fluid motion exciter. Prescribed acceleration levels can be accurately introduced through controlled pulses/oscillations or spin/rotation/vibration of the large and small floating fluid samples. We propose to develop a prototype flight unit to be tested on a reduced-gravity parabolic aircraft in Phase I. In Phase II, we will develop a space-qualifiable AFPRF system that can be used on the International Space Station to satisfy current and future fluid physics flight experiments. The AFPRF would become a powerful research tool with a very low-g, vibrationally isolated, float zone capability combined with a controllable acceleration and disturbance levels that would enhance future fluid physics experiments.",

Unique shock detection hardware based on a recently discovered relationship between the presence of shock and its surface signatures will be designed and fabricated. The Phase I effort will demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed innovation for on-line detection. A prototype system will be built and tested in Phase II to establish the proof-of-concept in a real flight environment. The detection of shock and an understanding of shock-boundary-layer interactions is of primary importance to the safety and efficient performance of high-speed vehicles.",

The work proposed here includes synthesis and characterization of an innovative, new polymer/composite electrolyte. The synthesis will include new methods for preparing these electrolytes using an innovative chemical approach. This feasibility demonstration will involve the electrochemical characterization of the proposed electrolyte and limited battery testing of the better candidate electrolytes to demonstrate their effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  A low cost high energy density lithium-ion battery system is proposed based on doped Mn-based cathode material and low cost domestic graphite in 1M LiPF6 electrolyte with ternary carbonate-based organic solvents. A series of modified Mn-based lithium intercalation compounds will be synthesized by sol-gel process and characterized using analytical as well as electrochemical techniques. The potential candidate materials will further be evaluated as cathodes for lithium-ion batteries. Cathodes and anodes will be prepared by using a well-established electrodes fabrication technique. The reversible capacity of the modified LiMxMn2-xO4 will be evaluated by developing half-cells with metallic lithium as the counter electrode. Several prismatic design lithium-ion pouch cells will be made with the low temperature electrolyte to examine the feasibility of the proposed concept.",

The OFQS is non-intrusive and capable of instantaneous indication of the presence of two phase flow. In addition, the fully developed sensor will be capable of determining relative concentrations of several different fluids and/or gases which may be present. Response time of the sensor will be capable of monitoring flow rates in excess of 17,000 gpm in cryogenic rocket engine test facilities. During Phase I a proof-of-concept experiment will be performed to validate the basic principle of operation. The results of phase I will feed directly into the development of a working prototype sensor to be developed in Phase II.",

In space wounds may heal differently than here on earth. Laser light has shown some benefit for wound healing, but has limited surface area and wavelength. Advances in semiconductor technology, developed for NASA's long range life support missions, have led to the development of light emitting diode systems capable of high irradiant output equivalent or superior to laser sources being used in wound healing today. These LEDs offer the potential for dramatic improvement in wound healing over lasers for future space flight, civilian and military applications.",

Small accelerations also cause slosh states which frustrate static measurements. Gauging systems on spacecraft must also handle cryogens accurately (and not, for example, add any significant heat to cryotanks). Foster-Miller proposes to combine its patented Dynamical Instruments nonlinear analysis with an acoustic or radio frequency resonant mode sensor. Existing efforts have correlated liquid volume roughly with resonant frequency. Unfortunately, slosh states and varying vapor-liquid orientations prevent conventional linear signal analysis from attaining useful accuracies. We propose to use Foster-Miller's dynamic nonlinear signal analysis methods to extract liquid quantity accurately (at least within",

We believe that the use of this advanced prismatic pumping cavity will allow us to achieve highly efficient operation (as compared with currently used pump cavity designs) in CW as well as in quasi-CW regimes and at the same time provide efficient conductive cooling of the Nd:YLF rod. This study will provide the means for construction of a compact efficient laser source with output average power scalable up to 150 W in TEMoo mode or up to 250 W in multimode regime. We estimate the real efficiency of the laser to be on the order of 45-50%.",

        "abstract": "Not Available  Creare proposes an innovative small cryogenic cooler for future space missions, emphasizing high reliability, low cost, and very light weight. The cooler employs a pulse tube cold head and a thermo-compressor, eliminating the weight, expense, and reliability burden of the compressor drive motor and the power electronics. In Phase I, we will experimentally demonstrate auto-resonant operation of a thermo-compressor displacer and design an engineering model cryocooler system. The key outcome of this effort will be confirmation that the Phase II cooler can operate successfully with minimal electronics. In Phase II, we will fabricate a complete cryocooler system, perform laboratory testing, and document performance characteristics.",
