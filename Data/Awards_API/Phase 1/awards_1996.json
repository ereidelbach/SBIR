        "abstract": "Tools for engineering of complex, embedded, high-performing real-time systems comprise a critical technology area.  21st Century Systems, Inc. proposes to design and eventually (in Phases II and III) develop and commercialize an environment tool-suite that will perform systems synthesis for such systems.  The environment will include a system component manager, a system description language, and a powerful and intuitive, graphical front end.  The environment will support and rely significantly on COTS tools, and will provide both interactive and automated assistance (including agents) to system engineers, during key stages of system lifecycle.  Hierarchies, multi-views and a rich selection of functional and non-functional objectives (including those major significance to embedded systems, such as performance/power) will be supported, and key analysis, simulations and synthesis functions will be provided.  To implement the proposal, 21st Century Systems, Inc. has assembled a very strong team, which also includes Aesthetic Solutions, Inc., the Real-Time Computing Lab at NJIT and Johns Hopkins University.  The team is eminently qualified to implement the proposal, given its reconized expertise and solid track-record in system engineering tools for complex real-time systems, system component management, 3-D modeling and visualization, cost and objective functions, and system analysis and simulation.",

This modulator is based on Inductive Energy Store (IES) using an array of Diamond Opening Switches for power compression.  Because power amplification using IES requires a much smaller volume than capacitive pulse compression, the footprint of such modulators is considerably smaller than that of equivalent pulse-line accelerators.  The repetition rate is also much higher than for modulators that use gas switches.  Magnetic switches are best suited to low energy/pulse applications, becoming bulky and less cost effective at >100J/pulse energies.  Si (or GaAs) switches have low voltage hold-off and are limited to 1kJ/pulse at > 10kHz rep-rate, with voltage hold-off at the 0.5-1MV level.

        "abstract": "Alameda Applied Sciences Corporation (AASC) proposes a three phase effort with the ultimate goal of producing a marketable diamond switch suitable for several pulsed power and other applications in the defence arena.  The presently used spark gaps have several drawbacks including switch jitter, large and variable inductance, lifetime and physical size.  A low inductance solid-state switch capable of switching 100 kV, 100kA at a high repetition rate would be desireable.  The physical and electrical properties of diamond make it uniquely suited to very high power electrical switching applications.  Electron beam controlled diamond switches have been demonstrated at moderate (22 kV) voltages and current densities >5 kA/cm2.  Diamond, normally a good insulator, can carry large currents when electron-hole pairs are created by the absorption of an energetic electron beam.  The objectives of the Phase I research is to study the switching properties of diamond under high field stress (1-10 MV/cm) to develop a design for a practical diamond switch.  The switch will be fabricated and validated in Phase II.  Commercialization is planned for Phase III.  Anticipated Benefits:  DoD's pulsed power supplies for nuclear weapons effects simulators and other applications including high power lasers would benefit from the low inductance, low jitter, fast rise-time, high power diamond switch to be developed under the proposed effort.  Potential applications include switching systems for the nation's power grid, high power accelerators, the More Electric Aircraft, automobiles and drilling rigs.",

The challenge for Phase I is to find innovative ways to preserve the good properties of existing vacuum arc ion sources when extrapolated into the new regime required for heavy ion fusion. Existing sources offer low emittance with >100 \u00bfs pulse widths at modest currents. The Phase I effort is aimed at increasing the current while preserving the low emittance in short (1-20 \u00bfs) pulses. The Phase II effort will validate the source at repetition rates relevant for heavy ion fusion and demonstrate source lifetime and reliability.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  The vacuum arc ion source should find several commercial applications including heavy ion fusion, surface and materials characterization, heavy ion synchrotron injection and isotope separation.",

Presentation of such results involves automatically generating browsable documents so that the user can navigate through as well as manipulate a space of documents at the level of detail and/or with focus criteria that he is interested in.  In this proposal, we will focus on the latter need and develop an integrated logical theory of hypermedia presentations.  We will demonstrate this theory on battlefield applications where a commander may wish to track and manipulate changes in a region of the world.  Based on the theory, we will build an implementation of a system called BattleView that automatically synthesizes hypermedia presentations paradigm will then be coupled to existing methods of consulting multimedia data sources (such as via the University of Maryland HERMES system) to provide and integrated querying cum presentation environment.",

We can perform this test quickly and cost effectively because a significant portion of the NNP hardware is implemented in field programmable gate arrays.  An option, if exercised, will allow more extensive revision of a NNP and testing as a FNNP Phase I will lead to a board-sized product in Phase II and a single integrated circuit or chip set in Phase HI. using neural network and fuzzy logic technologies together promises dramatically increased processing performance for visual and FLIER scene processing, target recognition, IFF, and image compression for bandwidth efficient transfer.",

A pair of Dexterous Vises, the \"Dual-Vise\", enable revealing all six faces of the cutting tool without actual re-fixturing, which adds two degree of freedom to the machine tool.  Second, a computer software based method for aiding and systematizing the procedure of fixture selection and allocation is to be developed, based on the previous work Intelligent Workstation Intiative.

        "abstract": "Herein, ACX proposes to develop compact, low cost, integrated smart packs for vibration reduction.  Each package would include actuators and sensors, drive and signal conditioning electronics as well as simple controllers to yield a self standing solution to vibration problems.  The electronics module would be low cost and compact.  The pack would run off of standard available power supplies and would require minimal interaction, aside from an initial bond and checkout on the structure.  These packs provide a protective skin offering electrical isolation and provide a means for integration of sensors, signal conditioning, and control electronics.  Producing a compact yet low cost design will require detailed analysis of the thermal dissipation characteristics of the layout as well as the effects of parasitic capacitance due to a tightly packed circuit.  It is envisioned that the electronics module will be a composite of multiple layers of flexible circuit populated with components, epoxy and plastic spacer material.  In a sense, the module will be a multilayer board with the components as well as the traces embedded inside.  The design of the packs will be such that they could be manufactured in high volume and would exhibit high operational reliability and durability.  The fabrication of these devices will involve expanding upon existing ACX techniques, currently used to manufacture the QuickPack (TM) as well as passive piezo dampers which incorporate a surface mount shunt resistor. Anticipated Benefits:  A completely integrated and inexpensive package for vibration control can be applied to a wide range of DoD and commercial systems include aircraft and submarine problems such as lifting surface motion control, disturbance rejection and flutter suppression, and engine vibration and acoustic noise reduction.  Vibration reduction can in some instances improve the lifetime of components by reducing rms strain levels.",

Current gambrel marking systems allow for acquisition of data and relate it to an individual carcass but cease to have benefit once carcass conversion commences.  The proposed system uses novel two-dimensional code marketing on the gambrel and on multiple carcass locations and robust reading approaches using machine vision technology and allows carcasses to be tracked beyond dismound and data to be collated on individual primals for individual animals.  2D codes hold more information and cope with low-contrast printing or mark degradation.  Combined with new primal weight, quality, and yield measurement systems, the proposed technology will allow performance data for individual carcasses to be objectively monitored.  Potentially, live animals may also be marked and tracked generating complete data on individual producer performance.  In Phase I we will determine the suitability of the marking technology for the environment, determine optimal carcass and gambrel marking methods and locations, and propose specifications/designs for a production system to be developed in Phase II.",

The final instrument will be cost-effective, simple enough to be operated by non-technical people, and rugged in design.

        "abstract": "This project proposes to investigate the efficiencies of several material systems in which the ability to draw three dimensional images in red, green, and blue using two-step, two-frequency upconversion in a solid-state medium has already been demonstrated. The technology under investigation provides true RGB three-dimensional display capabilities which feature unlimited, unencumbered viewing access to large numbers of users simultaneously. The display can be viewed through all sides, and from any angle, and does not require the use of any type of viewing apparatus. This technology may potentially yield a novel method for the display of complicated tactical environments, providing improved critical feature extraction, and allowing for faster and more accurate evaluation. A comparison of material systems will be made based on measured intrinsic optical properties which have been shown to fundamentally determine upconversion efficiency. Material systems in which the three colors can be optimized will be identified and recommended for full-scale system development in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Automated Cynamics Corporations (ADC) proposes to exploit its knowledge of automated in-situ consolidation of thermoplastic carbon fiber  unidirectional tape to reduce the high scrap rate currently experienced in the in the fabrication of thermoset (epoxy) carbon fiber sabots.  The current production process requires several steps which result in material loss (scrap) of approximately 60-70%.  Approximately one half of the loss results in converting unidirectional tape to wedges in a multi-step, labor intensive process.  An automated in-situ consolidation process using commercially available thermoplastic carbon fiber prepreg offers the potential to eliminate virtually all of the material waste in fabricating the wedges.  Additional significant material savings may be available if a lower weight near net-shape, can be fabricated using the automated process.  In addition, potential productivity enhancements due to automation and reduces labor requirements may be available.  Finally, the use of thermoplastics versus thermosets brings several advantages: 1.  Enhanced performance due to outstanding toughness. 2.  Material scrap and rejects are recyclable. 3.  Infinite shelf life versus limited thermostet life based on out-time. 5.  Reduced VOC's 6.  No special environment is required for in-situ fabrication.",

The throughput of this system can reach up to 100 millin frames/sec, yet unlike currently available systems of comparable speed, it is fully programmable and extremely flexible.  Algorithms for processing information from the input of multiple sensor can easily be implemented on a 3D-Flow system to achieve a real-time processing system with a very short lag time.  Currently, systems of comparable speed are custom built with Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) that implement fixed algorithms, rendering them inflexible.  The programmability of the 3D-Flow system makes it suitable for real-time data processing applications required in a wide range of fields. The system is also highly modular and incrementally upgradeable.  During phase I, the existing preliminary design of the 3D-Flow Processor will be completed after the requirement analysis of artificial intelligence based information processing systems and other commercial applications.  Detailed simulations of the algorithms on the 3D-Flow will be conducted to evaluate system performance.  A report on commercial applications of the system along with its cost/performance estimate will help designers make informed choices about high-speed real-time systems.",

Those materials have mostly thermosetting epoxy matrices and occur in  intimate association with metals, paints, and coatings.  Current techniques for recycling  thermoset composites, mostly for automotive sheet molding compounds (SMC), involve  pulverizing the material for use as fillers.  That approach does not reclaim the value from  aircraft reinforcing fibers and may not be feasible for the skin-core constructions used in  aircraft structures.  The proposed Phase I program examines the applicability of a novel low-  temperature, catalytic conversion recycling process for composite aircraft components.  This  process has been shown to work with complex mixtures such as tires and circuit boards.  All  polymeric materials (composite matrices, adhesives, paints, coatings) are converted to a  valuable mixture of low molecular weight hydrocarbons and removed from the fibers, metals,  and pigments that can then be reclaimed for reuse.",

Metal, glass, and filler impurities are separated from the hydrocarbons during the process and can be reclaimed or landfilled. A related technology has been demonstrated on a large scale (100 tons/day) for recycling used tires. For application to Navy Plastic Processor product (and/or land-based plastic waste), a survey of shipboard waste compositions, volumes, and locations will be taken, feedstock preparation equipment will be evaluated, conversion products will be determined using a continuous feed laboratory-scale reactor, product toxicity and resale markets will be identified, and, finally, the economics of a large-scale tertiary recycling operation will be estimated.

        "abstract": "The III-V nitrides have recently emerged as the primary material system for UV/blue light emitters. Higher bandgap energy (Al,Ga)N alloys are currently employed as cladding layers for GaN and (In,Ga)N active region LEDs and laser structures. Lattice mismatch between the cladding and active regions, however, restricts both the thickness and composition of the layers which in turn limits the operating efficiency of the devices. This is particularly problematic for the fabrication of high efficiency laser diodes.  (Al,In)N is an alloy system which offers the potential to fabricate completely lattice matched III-V nitride heterostructures. There has been little work to date on the growth of high quality (Al,In)N and, as a result, many of the fundamental properties of this alloy system, such as bandgap energy, have never been experimentally verified. In this Phase I program, we will examine the feasibility of growing (Al,In)N alloys and (Al,Ga)N/GaN heterostructures by metal organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE). This technology will serve as the foundation for high efficiency UV lasers to be fabricated in Phase II. Phase III will consist of further development and commercialization of these devices.",

        "abstract": "Large power handling systems of 1KW to 150KW are required in a many applications ranging from aerospace to consumer electronics to industrial power systems and transportation. Conventional electronic systems, based on silicon or gallium arsenide devices, require a large number of devices enhanced with extra heat sinking and sophisticated control systems to ensure synchronous operation.  The extra components increase system weight and size, reduce reliability and can also reduce efficiency. Because of its unique properties, SiC is an ideal material for high temperature and power applications. Its characteristics enable device operation at high temperatures and in high power regimes inaccessible to other semiconductors. In this Phase I program we will develop thin, high integrity device quality oxides for use in SiC high power MOSFETs.  The work will focus on the growth of low defect density interfaces by rigorous control of the oxide formation. Success will lead to the design and fabrication of high power, high temperature SiC MOSFETs in Phase II. In Phase III, commercial power MOSFETs as well as analog IC's will be targeted for manufacture.",

        "abstract": "Increasingly strict emissions requirements and the need to increase fuel economy and reduce service intervals have dramatically accelerated the use of monitor and control electronics in engines. traditional methods such as adjusting the  air/fuel ratio to optimize catalyst performance are not effective enough to meet future requirements.  Measurement of the pressure in each cylinder permits enhanced control of engine operation which results in decreased exhaust emissions and improved fuel efficiency.  A large and growing percentage of sensors are being replaced by micromachined silicon sensors but their operating temperature range is typically O < T < 125 C;  silicon-based devices are inherently unsuitable at high temperature.  Silicon carbide sensors and control electronics can potentially operate at temperatures approaching 1000 c or in harsh invironments.  ATMI has successfully developed a novel surface SiC micromachining technology applicable to the manufacture of a cost-effective in-cylinder pressure measurement system for automotive use.  In Phase I we will fabricate a prototype pressure transducer.  In Phase II we will optimize the transducer design and integrate a small preamplifier on the same chip as the sensor.

This goal will be accomplished by developing a low-cost, near net-shape technology for fabrication and rapid densification of ablation and oxidation-resistant LRE components for a wide variety of Air Force missions.  The material which will be used for this purpose is zirconium diboride/boron nitride composite, which has good ablation resistance, thermal shock resistance, and good erosion resistance dur to high hardness, but much greater toughness than the monolithic form of ZrB2.  The ZrB2/BN composite will have an interpenetrating microstructure of elongated polycrystalline cells of the base material, zirconium diboride, separated by cell boundaries-very thin layers of low shear strength refractory material, boron nitride.  This interpenetrating microstructure imparts toughness and thermal shock resistance to the material.  The advantage of this technology is that complex microstructures are created completely from inexpensive powders, by mixing them with polymer binders and spinning this mixture into fibers.  These fibers are wound into a complex-shape part, which is then rapidly densified via Electroconsolidation to near net-shape with minimal post machining required, resulting in a low-cost process.",

The innovation of this project involves modifying and exisiting advanced coal devolatilization model, and making it suitable for pyrolysis of biomass.  The soundness of this approach is based on numerous similarities between biomass and coal.  There are important differences, however, which preclude direct application of the coal model.  The objective of Phase I program is to create a predictive biomass-pyrolysis model incorporating a detailed understanding of the underlying physical and chemical processes.

Advanced  Material Systems  (AMS) proposes a study that could solve this problem through the development  of an adhesive  system that would cure at room temperature in less that 3 minutes and yet meet  all of the in-service  requirements.  There is no such product available in today's market. Our approach in Phase I is to study the characteristics of families of adhesives  with applicability to  the primary materials with supporting combinations and/or additives, and  demonstrate the feasibility  of achieving satisfactory performance through select screening tests.  Phase Ib  would then derive  other properties of the better formulations (or variations of them), yielding an  identification of the  optimal candidate(s).",

        "abstract": "The proposed effort in Phase I is to identify properties of propellants that solidify at cryogenic temperatures, \"cryosolids\", that will be tested in Phase Ii and to deliver a detailed design of a cryogenic testing device.  This device will be able to measure tensile, flexural, shear and compressive strength, elastic moduli, and hardness of these cryosolids.  In addition, this device will be able to measure the surface tension of the liquid form of these materials.  During Phase I, shear tests will be performed on solid oxygen and surface tension tests will be performed on liquid nitrogen in order to improve the design of the cryogenic testing device.  Knowledge obtained at the Advanced Materials Laboratory, Inc. is shear testing solid oxygen as well as the mechanical testing of various materials at liquid helium temperatures will be used in the development of the cryogenic testing device.  Theory and description of the essential features envisaged for this device are described.  The cryogenic testing experience obtained over more than thirty years and the experience of manufacturing commercially used products by the principal investigator in his company will enhance the probability of designing and building a reliable cryogenic testing device based upon sound engineering principles.|  Benefits:  Anticipated benefits are to replace current rocket propulsion systems with others having improved performance and to provide cryogenic mechanical testing equipment and services for universities, industry, and government facilities engaged in fundamental cryogenic research.|",

In the current solicitation the Navy has asked potential contractors to examine the possibility of using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware for the development of a missile turbo-pump system.  The solicitation provides two design operating points for the pump system. Based on the two design points specified, Advanced Projects Research, Incorporated (APRI) has performed a preliminary design of the missile turbo-pump system.  This preliminary design demonstrates technical feasibility.  The design reference turbo-pump consists of a commercially available automotive turbocharger turbine, a commercially available centrifugal pump impeller and housing, and a commercially available high pressure hydraulic gear pump.  These components were matched to perform well together at the two design points to provide the hydraulic power and fuel flow at the required pressure.  In the design reference turbo-pump, a specially designed gear housing and gear train is contemplated.",

The algorithm is intended for application in a periodic dynamic system with a large number of degrees of freedom as is commonly the case in current comprehensive rotorcraft analysis codes (such as 2GCHAS).  The innovation of this proposal can be summarized as follows:  1) Utilizing Model Order Reduction to establish a sufficiently accurate reduced order model based on model reduction from finite elements to find the rotorcraft trim.  The transient of the full finite element dynamic equations are solved using the solution from the reduced order model as an initial estimation to reduce the runtimes to reach steady state.  2)  Taking advantage of periodicity of a multi-bladed rotor to reduce the size of rotor system equations by a factor of the number of blades.  3) Applying the Quasi-Newton method for the solution of nonlinear equations to overcome the disadvantage of computing and inverting the Jacobian matrix as required in the Newton-Raphson method.  Utilization of Broyden-Fletcher-Shanno Rank Two algorithm, one of the most successful algorithm of the Quasi-Newton method in nonlinear equation solutions, will allow the aerodynamic effects to be included in the solution iteration.  Thus, the solution convergence speed will be improved.",

The technology is based on the rapid rejection of two chemicals, contained within the device, into the surrounding air where they combine to form a fine particulate, opaque cloud (smoke).  While this device provides good visual obscuration, the stored chemicals are toxic and potentially harmful to humans, the unit is expensive to manufacture, and it can be \"activated\" only once. In addition, recent evidence indicates the existence of long-term performance degradation due to stored chemical migration into the intricately machined dispensing manifold. Phase I of this project will identify an alternative non-toxic, non-lethal technology, which meets existing obscuration performance and eliminates the disadvantages noted.  Phase II will specify a simple prototype design and verification test plan, build and test the production prototype, and finalize the design and prepare a manufacturing package.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee: A visual obscurant device, which is not harmful to humans nor expensive to manufacture, should be deployed extensively in Federally owned, high security facilities.

Important technical issues to be resolved during Phase I include the compatibility of the ROOM notation and the Java language, and the avoidance of side effects from embedded resource contention actors. The overall result of Phase I research will be a demonstration of the feasibility of enhancing the ROOM design methodology to support the Java language environment. The feasibility of this environment will be shown in a limited technology demonstration involving the derivation of Java code from an OpenROOM model.

        "abstract": "A radical, high performance system design concept for UAV missions is proposed.  Its characteristics derive directly from propulsion and power generation capabilities inherent in microturbine technology under development at MIT.  The proposed vehicle configurations is an oblate spheroid, giving a high package volume with sufficient fuel capacity for hover duration of about one hour.  Thrust from multiple microturbines is used directly for propulsion, maneuver and hover, with control implemented via pulsed on-off operation of selected engines.  The result is a High Performance Aerial Vehicle (HIPERAV), carrying a large instrument package, which incorporates sensor, data transmitter, and mission/vehicle control functions.  This is conceived as an interchangeable plug-in unit, with programmable capability.  Electrical power is taken from one or more of the propultion turbines, resulting in very high power for data transmission.  This implies both a high data rate capability, and potential for satallite interfacing, despite the limited antenna size and efficiency.  Specific approaches for implementation of this concept, and their mission and vehicle implications are outlined in the proposal.  Based on this, a preliminary system definition study of vehicle and mission utilization is proposed.  It will address mission and hardware interpendence, and define key technology limitations requiring Phase II development.",

This project will explore the feasibility of monitoring tritium by using an ultra low density (milligrams per cubic centimeter range) silica aerogel as a carrier of a scintillation phosphor. The phosphor will be perfused into the aerogel in the gas phase, where it will be adsorbed onto the existing silica structure of the aerogel.  Because the low density aerogel is highly permeable to gases, every tritium atom in the gas will be close to a region of space containing scintillation phosphor.  In this way, the problem of absorption by the ambient air, of the low energy beta particles emitted by tritium is avoided. The novel aspect of this research is the multi-phase (aerogel/ phosphor) scintillator material; in other respects, the tritium monitor is based on the well established principles of scintillation counting, using standard photomultiplier tubes and pulse counting circuitry.  Naphthalene will be used as a typical aromatic scintillation phosphor, used in conventional scintillation counters.  The project will determine how much scintillation phosphor can be put into the foam, how well it works, and what kind works best. \n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The tritium monitor will be more sensitive, rugged and reliable than existing monitors based on other techniques (such as ionization chambers).  It will have a commercial market wherever tritium must be monitored, and may also be applicable to the real-time monitoring of radon, a well known health hazard in buildings.",

Recent developments in the fuel injection including split injection wherein the fuel is injected in two or three pulses rather than with a single injection have led to significant improvements in terms of the reduction in the emissions.  To date, the experimentation on these methods has focused primarily on varying the rise time, duration, and dwell between the injections while observing the outcome in terms of chamber pressure, heat release, and emissions.  It is the purpose of this work to investigate the details of the atomization, fuel penetration and mixing under the split injection strategies.  Laser light sheet imaging with image processing will be used to study the global features of the transient spray events.  The PDPA will then be used to probe the details of the spray obtaining time-resolved drop size and velocity data at representative points within the pray plume.  Conditions that mimic those used by Reitz at the U. of Wisconsin to obtain improved performance will be studied in the Phase I project.  These data will be acquired in a pressure chamber operated at type diesel cylinder pressures.",

Recent Rad curable BMIs and epoxies suffer from voids due to lack of processability.  Aeroplas Corporation International (ACI) proposes to demonstrate and further develop their line of atomic oxygen resistant (AOR) E-Beam curable composite resins developed for NASA-LaRC for use by the new ARPA Lockheed Martin Skunk Works (LMSW) - Integrated Airframe Technology for Affordability (IATA) team which is using a new highly penetrating, 10 MeV E-beam rapid curing technique.  This series of AOR and proposed low cost resins are expected to exhibit outstanding processability and are available in either low or up to (solid) viscosities.  After predictable reformulation work they are suitable for such composite manufacturing technologies as resin transfer molding, wet lay-up, pultrusion and thick (solid) versions that are suitable for constant-tack automated prepreg tape/tow lay-up.  The ACI team is an assembly of top experts in fields of Radiation Polymer Chemistry, E-Beam composite processing, Health Physics and Environmental Effects and Mechanical Testing.  ACI will formulate lower cost, high Tg, tough, highly processable rapid cure resins and test these neat resins and graphite-composite panels until the resin formuation(s) meet all requirements of the ARPA (IATA) team's LMSW General Material Specification.  Anticipated Benefits:  The proposed process is cost-effective (does away with the costs associated with oven curing or autoclaving); rapid (minutes versus hours); environmentally friendly; is a low, ambient temperature process (for less molded in thermal stresses); is less expensive and less complicated; is amenable to scale up.  The impact of the proposed concept is tremendous.  The proposed technology will find immediate application in Infrastructural Pultrasion, Automotive, Aerospace and other industries.",

However, the realization of this cost savings has been restricted by quality problems (e.g. voids, poor fiber volume control) inherent to the RTM process.  Similar quality issues in autoclave processes have benefited from the use of advanced process control systems such as the Air Force developed \"Qualitative Process Automation\" and Aerospace Service and Control's (ASC's) Composite Processing Control (CPC) systems.  These advanced systems utilize sensor feedback and a knowledge base to make control decisions and alter the process in real-time with the goal of improved end product quality.   To date, no known parallel has been attempted for the RTM process.  This effort proposes to apply this advanced control technology to the RTM process.  This will be accomplished through the development and feasibility demonstration of novel Process Monitoring and Control System.  The system would be based on ASC's proven CPC system and would utilize a recently demonstrated DC-Resistance measurement system to establish the resin state and flow front progression.  This data would be processed in real time via a PC based controller.  A graphical representation of the flow/resin state would be continuously available to the operator.  The ability for the system to make control decisions/actions, based on sensor data and a knowledge base will be developed into the system.  Control actions would include variations in localized mold heating, vacuum, etc.  afforded through multi-zone control.  Anticipated Benefits:  Military Benefits:  Provide structural quality improvements required to realize cost savings potential of RTM in airframe application.

The radar itself will be a totally new and fully airworthy flight demonstration unit, the principles and characteristics of which will be conceptually similar to two patented airborne ground-penetrating radar systems the company currently employs to detect buried unexploded ordinance and other hazardous materials. The UAV radar, however, will include new and innovative hardware and software tailored specifically for operation from the UAV that can also be used from manned airborne platforms for other military and commercial applications. Phase I will consist of four major technical studies that consider the ultimate radar and antenna systems design and construction in relation to the payload and performance envelope of the UAV.  From preliminary radar design and performance studies already undertaken in-house, AESI does not consider the radar's payload and power budgets for the UAV to be major factors.  However, the design and integration of the antenna system with the candidate radar and the UAV will be very important to the ultimate performance of the radar.  Also of importance will be on-board signal generation and processing and ensuing data compression, transmission, processing, analysis and display.  These tasks will address the trade-offs and options involved in the ultimate definition of the radar's frequency, bandwidth, pulse repetition rate, gain, range and transmission rates, and the design of the accompanying antenna system.  The report on Phase I will clearly delineate the proposed design, construction, and flight testing of the total radar system in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "The United States Army has identified the need for high power efficiency transmitter systems.  The goals of the U.S. Army can be achieved through the use of switched mode amplifiers used as Class D or E.  The objective of this proposed Phase I SBIR program is to design a pair of complementary FET's (N-Channel and P-Channel) capable of switching at frequencies sufficient to provide switch mode amplification of frequencies up to 1Ghz and delivering 250 to 300 watts of RF power.  The design of complementary FET's will include SUPREM an PISCES simulation accomplished using a commercial software program called STADIUM TCAD.  This is a proprietary AET too which is user-friendly font-end for the SUPREM and PISCES simulators and develops statistical results from manufacturing process variability data.  This proposal is being offered by AET, Inc., a small high technology business whose mission is to develop and commercialize modeling and simulation software for statistical optimization.  AET will utilize the expertise at Florida Institute of Technology in the simulation of FET devices using SUPREM and PISCES.  Harris Semiconductor will be the industrial partner responsible for developing practical design ground rules and will be the source for device fabrication during a Phase II SBIR contract.",

Together these two components will allow the simultaneous transmission of an unprecedented number of mulitple user messages.  The technology is based on a design methodology to design optimally noise robust nonorthogonal wavelet packet multiplexing signals and a computationally efficient method for user bit vector estimation.  Our design method yields multi-user messages which are optimally robust to bursty channel noise and allows error-free reconstruction in low noise levels.",

This proposal presents alternative approach that has the ability of generating a high visibility signal that can be seen for over one mile and is environmentally friendly in that no toxic materials are contained or generated by the signal cartridge and will not initiate bomb range fires.  The proposed approach also uses components of the current MK4MOD3 to ensure compatability with existing practice bombs.  The specific objective of this Phase I effort is to show feasibility of the concept with an engineering prototype with justification for transitioning into a Phase II program.

The access mechanisms will provide both static and dynamic data access and exchange structural and input parameter data within the modeling environment; dynamic access and exchange will allow models to exchange data during model execution and update input parameters from internal and external data sources within a network environment.  In addition, we will conduct a paper study to demonstrate the validity of the model-neutral data structure by applying the defined data structures to exchange data between three modeling methods.  In Phase II, we will develop a full-scale implementation of the model-neutral data structure and accompanying access methods.

We propose an architecture containing   an offboard data processor to extract data relevant to the   mission, and a set of fusion modules for recursively associating   sensor reports, tracking targets, and classifying targets.    These modules are derived from a well-posed mathematical   formulation which enables us to define precise interfaces among   the fusion modules. This approach provides three benefits to Air   Force Wright Labs. (AFWL).  First, it enables AFWL to construct   a fusion algorithm with close-to-optimal target tracking and   classification performance.  Second, it allows AFWL to study new   fusion algorithms by implementing alternate algorithms for each   module.  Third, it allows AFWL to process data from any   combination of sensors making the architecture applicable to a   variety of fighter platforms and missions.  We will show that the proposed AIFS can increase a pilot's   situational awareness by providing him with a clearer battlefield   picture consistent with mission objectives.  We will define   performance metrics that reflect mission objectives as well as   evaluate algorithmic performance.  We will validate our system   using a simple but realistic air-to-ground scenario simulation.",

The robust control, as a second level, is designed based on the linearized and decoupled system dynamics to guarantee the, performance in the presence of tainties. Finally, a novel adaptive control scheme is employed to provide adaptivity and to fine tune the hovering control system (HCS) performance.  Ibis optimal combination scheme exploits and integrates the merits offered by nonlinear, robust and adaptive control and is expected, to greatly enhance the performance and increase the service life of future undsea vehicles.

The processing architecture is based on a neural network configuration expanded to encode in a direct and unambiguous manner statistical information   This creates a hybrid architecture that permits the best attributes of both domains to be utilized for the classification of data corresponding to trauma survival predictive variable.  The approach is based on the realization that no single techniques is capable of solving by itself the more difficult aspects of the highly complex trauma survival classification problem.  Thus, there exists a strong need to coherently assemble the best elements of different techniques so as to reenforce the positive contributions by each and to neutralize, through complemention , their deficiencies.  The architecture chosen is Gaussian Potential Function Network (GPFN) consisting of Gaussian Potential Functions Units (GPFU) with some key parameters determined by the statistical properties of the input feature vectors.  Other network structural parameters are determined through a \"training\" process that aims to yield a network output compatible to the object class the input vector belongs to.",

        "abstract": "There is a need for simple, light-weight practical instrumentation for rapid characterization of chemical and biological analytes in the modern battlefield.  Recently, a surface-sensitive diode laser (SSDL), having over 1% of the mode power in the region extending 40 nm from the laser surface has been designed and fabricated.  The SSDL was capable of monitoring the deposition of absorptive films as thin as 1.2nm as well as films containing little or no absorptive material.  This finding suggests that the SSDL can be used in Micro Total Analysis Systems (uTAS) as well as in both homogenous and heterogeneous immunoassay.  However, there remains a need to develop reliable methods of sample introduction to the 150um by 100um sensitive region of the SSDL.  This proposal suggests the development of microfluidic components capable of interfacing with the SSDL to allow automated probe deposition, analyte and probe regeneration.  The innovation featured by the proposed system is the combination of a SSDL to allow automated probe deposition, analyte detection and probe regeneration.  The innovation featured by the proposed system is the combination of a SSDL having intense surface optical fields with microfluidic components to provide a sensor having unparalleled sensitivity to chemical and analytes.  The Phase I technical objectives include evaluation of microfluidic components and structures, fabrication of the SSDL with inlet and outlet ports, and aquisition of families of test data for use in optimization of a proof-of-concept prototype system.",

Capacitors with high dielectric constant and high voltage withstand at cryogenic temperatures with low weight and volume lie on the critical path.  The proposed work focuses on innovative technology to demonstrate large capacitance values, as well as ferromagnetic core materials and overall optimal design for cryogenic inductors.  The passive components will be designed to enable scale up to megawatt class power converter systems.  The power converter will be designed to maximize the benefits of the cryogenic environment, while keeping heat loads to a minimum, using resonant and soft-switching techniques.",

        "abstract": "This proposal addresses the requirements for a Micro Aerial Vehicle (uAV) communications systems.  The RF link between an airborne uAV and uAV Ground Control Station (MGCS) presents significant technical challenges.  The central issue is the competing requirements of communications system complexity necessary to overcome the multiple communication link degradations versus the necessity for miniaturization to accomodate the size and weight constraints of the uAV platform.  An approach is considered which would maximize the leverage possible from existing infrastructure and communications systems.  The existing commercial cellular phone network is a possibility for the uAV/MGCS link.  PCMCIA cards are considered simultaneously as part of the airframe and ground station and, as a \"snap in and snap out\" uAV communication system modules which are selected and installed in response to mission requirements.  This proposal will result in a Preliminary Design for prototype uAV/MGCS communications system which will be developed and demonstrated in Phase II.  The Preliminary Design will be sufficiently detailed to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed Phase II prototype.",

Tomorrow's higher RF millimeter wave and communications electronics products, and more compact optical, instrumentation and medical apparatus have unique design requirements that require cast components with finer features held in better alignment with thinner walls and smaller cells held in flatter array with almost no dimensional variation.  These attributes cannot be achieved by present manufacturing methods.  The objective of this Phase I project will be to demonstrate that the lighter, stronger, thinner components required for these advanced products can be produced economically as almost net shape investment cast components by employing certain novel methods with which we have been experimenting and engineering.  By the end of this project we will have benchmarked present process capability and have demonstrated, on actual concurrently engineered parts, the feasibility and capability of the new methods to produce the required advanced components.  Significant reductions in wall thickness, size variation and cost can be achieved.  The proposed effort is embedded in Raytheon's TRP proposal.  Anticipated Benefits:  Completion of Phase I will point the way to providing smaller and more precise cast metal components than have been economically available previously, in support of efforts in the electronics industry to downsize, integrate and economize products.",

        "abstract": "Near-field frequency domain meaasurements of antennas over a planar   aperture are commonly used to obtain far-field patterns.  This   technique has now bben formulation in the time domain, which is   very desirable for short pulse signals.  An additional benefit,   particularly significant for antennas with low-sidelobes, arises   from time domain measurements in that edge effects of a finite   aperture size can potentially be eliminated.  Furthermore, the   computational efficiency and simplicity of a time domain approach   is comparable to a frequency domain approach when only a part of   the far-field is calculated.  Analytic Design, Incorporated (ADI) will develop an approach for a   time domain measurement system to characterize target scattering   and antenna radiation over wide bandwidths.  This approach will be   based upon ADI's experience in anechoic chamber integrated with   measurement and numerical techniques.  Using our extensive and   detailed experience with time domain antenna systems, we have a   unique broadband sensing probe concept which delivers a very flat   frequency response with a broad pattern to produce very smooth time   domain receiver characteristics.  While this probe will require   somewhat more numerical compensation, we believe that this concept   is an excellent candidate for comparison against the electrically   small, resistively-loaded dipole probe.  In this effort, we will   provide a comprehensive caparison of the two probe designs.",

Particlarly for applications that  must be performed in rapidly changing enviroments such as surveillance,  automatic target recognition, battle field monitoring, mobile platform navigation,  and situation awareness in hostile environments. Amherst Systems Inc.   proposes to exploit the currently available technologies to investigate the  feasibility of developing a real-time target detection  and tracking system based   on a hybrid approach. The proprosed program is an integration of biologically  inspired approaches and conventional image processing. It attempts to exploit  the advantages of  the conventional image processing methodologies, the  active nature of active computer vision,  and the robustness of neural network  based approaches.   The tagert recognition and classification are perfromed in  four steps: detection, verification, normalization, and recognition. Conventional  image processing methodologies are used to identify and to prepare normalized  data sets for neural networks to achieve reliable classification. The proposed  approach can use both filtering based and feature based methods to achieve  target detection. The proposed technology is parallel in nature.",

        "abstract": "Amron and its subcontractor BBN propose to show the feasibility of a broadband time-domain  adaptive beamformer (ABF) to suppress uncorrelated narrowband sources and multipaths from  correlated impulsive sources.  The work is motivated by political developments which have  emphasized warfare in littoral areas, where a key problem facing active sonar is scattering  from topographic features.  Active sonar receivers must use adaptive beamforming to suppress  this interference.  Unlike other AM, Amron's ABF suppresses both uncorrelated noise and  broadband correlated interference from explosive sources without signal suppression.  It  improves echo to noise ratios without degrading echoes and simultaneously suppress false  alarms from multipathed and other off-azimuth sources.  The ABF was developed by and is  available to Amron now at the Naval Research Laboratory.  The proposed tasks are data  collection, adapting the ABF to the multistatic active case, optimizing the ABF on a  training data set, evaluating it on another data set, writing a final report, and  optionally, developing a beam based ABF.  In Phase II, we will implement and test a  real-time optimized beam based ABF on dedicated Navy hardware.  The ABF may find other  applications in nuclear test monitoring and geophysical exploration",

        "abstract": "ANRO is currently under a Phase II SBIR contract to evaluate an Ultra-Wideband (UWB) linear radar array and the processing of co- and cross-polarization returns for detecting and discriminating buried mines.  Experiments indicate that both metallic and plastic ines located several inches below the suface are reliably detected using a novel real-time cancellation scheme; however, it appears that target discrimination is not solved, practically, using co- and cross-polarization discrimination alone.  The proposed approach will consider information about target size, shape and material that is inherent in the resonant region of co- and cross- polarized backscattered fields independently, as well as both together.  To accomplish this, it is shown that reducing the nominal center frequency of the present array from 2.5 GHz to 1 GHz provides reflected signals rich in mine discrimination information.  ANRO proposes to sequentially sample the received waveforms such that the microwave responses with bandwidths exceeding 500 MHz are reduced to low frequency video data.  These returns can be processed, digitally, in near real-time.  Since the istantaneous amplitudes and phases of backscattered pulses will be different for objects with different sizes, shapes and material compositions, a proven neural net approach is proposed to provide the required discrimination of targets.",

        "abstract": "Currently, most antenna array designs are mechanically steered.  However, as demand for higher performance antennas increases, an electronic replacement for the mechanical system becomes necessary.  An alternative that may prove to be more cost effective is to use ferrite patch antennas as the elements in the array.  The antenna's radiation characteristics are controlled by the direction and magnitude of the imposed magnetic fields that bias the ferrite.  This is accomplished without requiring additional circuitry in the signal path.  An initial study of this device is proposed.  The advanced ferrite handling capability of Maxwell Eminence will be used to simulate the readiation characteristics of a ferrite patcch antenna.  The possibility of using this finite element field simulation tool with its advanced absorbing boundary condition to simulate ferrite patch antennas will be studied.  An advantage of this type of solver is the ability to analyze ferrites with non-uniform bias fields.  The effect of such a non-uniform bias field will also be evaluated.  It is hoped that the result of this investigation will be a better understanding of the potential uses of ferrite patch antennas.",

This is especially true for neuromorphic analog  VLSI implementation that seek to mimic detailed biology in real  time and in very high speed digital implementations.  There is  need for a communication architecture that has sufficient  bandwidth and which preserves timing and causal order of events  being represented such as action potentials.  The architecture  should be designed for easy adaptation to a variety of  communication channels and bus standards, and it should be  interoperable with a variety of existing local and wide area  networking standards.  The Neural Internet Project seeks to address  these issues in order to help create the infrastructure necessary to  support small systems being built today and very large systems  expected to emerge in coming years.  This project extends system  integration technology already developed in the Silicon Cortex  Project supporting analog VLSI neural network systems.  This is  done by developing a protocol for neural event messages that can  support large address spaces of neurons and synapses and a  prototype of a router to selectively filter, transform, monitor,  and route event messages between different domains of neural  communication.",

Chief among the obstacles to these processes is the wide variety of conditions under which they would be required to operate.  Energetic material wastes might be distributed in surface soils; they might be given off as gaseous byproducts in energetic combustion processes; in many cases, bulk quantities of the energetic material might require conversion or modification prior to disposal.

Phase I  includes reducing  contaminants in the LaF3, optimizing  Nd doping levels, and optimizing light collection/transmission for maximum light yield.

The concept involves placing an array of small cavities in the nose region of a typical hypersonic interceptor (projectile, missile, or submunition).  The cavities act as multiple Helmholtz resonators, and can be made to operate in a very predictable manner to alter the inviscid strain field in the stagnation region.  In effect, the resonators simulate a body with a more blunt nose geometry than actually exists.  In addition, they provide \"thermoacoustic\" cooling from the adiabatic expansion/compression mechanism.  The design is both simple and inexpensive since there is no hardware or active control device to install.  The investigation is primarily experimental however a theoretical component is included to help interpret and explain the experimental results.  Global surface temperature measurements will be made with an IR camera.  Surface flow patterns and bow shock wave visualizations will be performed.  In addition, fluctuating pressure measurements inside the cavity will be made and correlated with the global temperature and shock wave shapes.  The concept also has a potential ancillary aero/optic application.  Since the resonators can create a nearly planar bow shock, this effect could be useful in minimizing radial density gradients in the nose region thus reducing boresight errors for forward looking sensors.",

        "abstract": "The objective of the Phase I effort is to demonstrate an experimental/numerical technique for formulating penetration equations and identifying pertinent material parameters to be used in those equations. Although penetration equations for isotropic metals are well developed, such equations are not readily applicable to anisotropic laminated composites, because composite failure is dominated by brittle fracture processes rather than ductile plastic flow. We will develop equations which combine empirical curve fits with physical principles.  The equations will primarily be obtained from fits to experimental data points plotted in the form of Phase or Residual Velocity Diagrams.  We will supplement the experimental data points with computational data points obtained with the DYNA3D finite element code using a progressive damage model for composites with failure criteria and degradation rules. Important features of this code for penetration applications are element erosion and adaptive slidelines.  We will also perform numerical parameter studies to obtain an improved understanding of the physics, and thus identify pertinent material parameters to be used in the penetration equations. The Phase I effort will deliver a prototype stand-alone code for predicting ballistic interaction between projectiles and fragments penetrating laminated composite targets.  The program will consist of the penetration equations, databases with default composite and impactor parameters, graphical output, and an advisor.",

        "abstract": "While the Internet may promise the potential of increased access to services and information, obstacles make access to such technology by rural businesses, educators and individuals difficult. \n\nMuch research has been conducted about bringing Internet services into K-12 education, and projects have in initiated to bring better Internet access to rural communities, yet the rift between urban and rurual access may be increasing as urban information and telecommunications companies rush to fulfill the demand in urban areas, while greater distances, lower population density and older, existing telephone technology make rural business less viable.  Partly as a result of these problems, there is less Internet education and knowledge in rural communities.\n\nExisting approaches to Internet education have severe economic drawbacks.  APU proposes to design and test the introduction of Internet concepts and technologies to a rural high school and then to a rural community using an innovative educational model that may be more efficient than traditional methods.  The proposed program is directed at demonstrating the feasibility of this approach to introducing Internet technology in rural areas.",

        "abstract": "The complexity of systems design has dramatically increased over the past decade.  Developers are responding to the complexity by modeling such systems in order to further understand, characterize, or analyze their behavior.  Any model-based application may actually utilize multiple models which potentially require common information.  Thus, a benefit can be derived, if one model utilizes the seamless capture of information by another model.  Unfortunately, information representations can be quite different and so simple information passing is impractical.  Exchange between differing model representations will require mechanisms and structures to act as a \"middleware\" between the models.  The design of an Agent-Based Middleware is proposed for Phase I which will allow models of differing representations to share information.  Models will share by utilizing common communications protocols and common model-content structures through their associated Agent Interactions Wrappers.  Common communication protocols will be extensions of current intelligent agent communication research.  Common structures will be devised from generic object-based constructs, producing an exchangeable model information middleware.  To assist the conversion of model content to the middleware, a user extendible ontology of concepts, entities and relationships will be devised.  The final design will clearly define all structures and mechanisms involved in this open architecture.",

A \"heterogeneous\" parallel computing environment provides a variety of architectural capabilities, orchestrated to perform an application whose tasks have such diverse execution requirements.  One form of a heterogeneous computing system is a \"mixed-mode\" or \"reconfigurable\" system, where a single parallel machine can operate in different modes of parallelism.  Another form is a \"mixed-machine\" system, where a suite of different high performance machines are connected together by high-speed links.  A key issue that must be addressed in using heterogeneous parallel computing architectures for real-time information processing is the design of a high-level operating system for matching the processing tasks to the appropriate machine in a mixed-machine parallel system and to the appropriate architecture configuration in a mixed-mode/reconfigurable parallel system.  This effort seeks to establish the feasibility of a new artificial intelligence (AI) based technique for implementing a high-level operating system for heterogeneous parallel computers.  The proposed intelligent operating system consists of architecture independent, generalized routines that are useful in all parallel computing environments and architecture specific specialization for a given architecture in the form of rules in the rule-base of a knowledge-based system.",

Even then, the mapping rates which are realized are too small for the areas which must be surveyed for operationally effective mine countermeasures or cost effective hazardous material remediation.  A sonar will be designed and evaluated that exploits emerging broadband source, receiver, synthetic aperature, and image processor technologies to provide a low frequency system that can detect, localize, and classify buried objects with sweep rates an order of magnitude better than presently available.  The design will emphasize small aperture and light weight for ease in deployment.  A detailed plan will also be developed for concept demonstration eventually leading to prototype development.  Anticipated Benefits:  This technology could lead to a wide area coverage, covert standoff mine countermeasures capability for buried mines in shallow water regions of Third World Nations.

We believe, however, that the system design should be included in the development.  A modified configuration will bring excellent cost benefits.  In addition, a problem exists with performance degradation of existing systems in the battlefield.  This is due to a combination of GPS jamming and nonlinear environmental sensitivities of inertial systems, and is not due to the choice of components.  A design is proposed using an adaptive intelligent software control system.  Objectives of the design are to continuously tune the inertial system to its in-flight environment and obviate the need for a military GPS receiver.  Instead, a commercial GPS receiver is used for in-air calibration, improving inertial system flight performance.  The combination of modifying the GPS receiver usage, and the improved inertial system performance, allows the use of commercialsystems of both types (GPS and inertial) in military applications.  In summary, the proposed design uses commercial equipment, resolves a problem of unreliable system performance, and provides opportunity for additional suppliers to pursue an expanded market, increasing competition and reducing cost.  Anticipated Benefits:  Uses commercial navigation equipment in military applications, solves a performance problem that exists in the battlefield, increases competition, reduces cost and improves reliability.",

The resulting strength increase will alleviate the adverse effects of frictional heating of  sapphire windows.  Frictional heating can initiate a c-axis strength loss, leading to premature failure.   The Aspen process will uniformly implant silicon atoms through the entire window, as well as, result  in the production of uniform point defects throughout the crystal structure.  These mechanisms will pin  the crystal lattice, resulting in a structure more resistant to rhombohedral twinning and thermal shock  failure.   Preliminary tests conducted by Aspen Systems have demonstrated that this process can be applied to  high purity sapphire with no adverse effects on the transmission characteristics in the Midwave  (3-5mm) region.    For the Phase I effort we will demonstrate proof-of-principal that our process can increase the high  temperature strength of sapphire without degrading its optical properties.   During the Phase I Option  and Phase II effort, we will optimize and tune the process to maximize the high temperature strength of  the resulting sapphire.   A statistically significant number of sapphire coupons will be processed and  tested to verify the mechanical properties of the modified dome material.

This solar cell design has several advantages which make it ideal for space concentrator systems. These are high system voltage (10 to 500 volts per cell), reliable low-cost interconnections, design flexibility, costs are independent of array voltage, and low power loss from shorts, opens, and impact damage. The low system current results in minimal I2R losses while the device design allows for minimal shading and resistance losses. This concentrator solar cell will incorporate the benefits of light trapping by growing the device active layers over a low-cost, simple, PECVD deposited silicon/silicon dioxide Bragg reflector.  The projected power density is 5 kW/m2 for an AM0 efficiency of 26% at 1 5X. This solar cell design is capable of meeting the high voltage requirement of electric propulsion systems, without the complex stringing required by conventional solar cell designs.

THese sensors will be multi-functional and possess the ability to measure displacement (or strain) and temperature.  They will be capable of embedment \"in-site\" or can be bonded to the exterior of motors that have already been manufactured.  If successful, the effect of forces exerted on the solid rocket motor during storage or operational loads could be measured.  These devices will be capable of monitoring strain in real time -- allowing a constant vigilance of the state-of-stress during aging and changing loading profiles. This technology will increase the ability of the engineer to assess the cure cycle during manufacture, safety aspects, state of repair, and expected service-life of the motor.  This research project will build on existing optical-fiber sensor technology to meet the Army and Department of Defense (DoD) needs.  It has commercial potential within other government agencies and in the private sector.  Three specific outcomes will result from Phase I  1) Development of techniques to place the fiber-optic sensors within the motor case; 2) Identification of test samples to verify the structural integrity of the case material; and 3) Preliminary analysis of the effect of the optical-fibers on the structural integrity of the motor and specimens.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this research is to design and implement error-correction coding in a free-space laser communication channel to correct both single bit and burst errors at a user data rate of 155 Mb/s. Correcting these errors will significantly increase the reliability and weather-dependent availability of lasercom systems.  Standard error-correction codes add redundant data to allow for correction of isolated errors; however, in an optical channel, atmospheric scintillation causes fading which can introduce bursts of errors. Practical real-time implementations of error-correction schemes for burst errors of this magnitude are presently nonexistent. An innovative error-correction method that allows for real-time correction of both single and burst errors will be tested by building a prototype electronic unit that will be integrated with AstroTerra's TerraLink-155 site-to-site lasercom system.  This error-correction method views user data as a two-dimensional block of rows and columns; adding coding to the rows will correct single-bit errors, while adding extra bits to the columns allows for the correction of burst errors that span an entire row. Testing and evaluation will be done to optimize certain elements of this coding scheme, including the row length, column length, and the type of code used.",

        "abstract": "This Phase I SBIR  proposal is aimed at developing and assessing the feasibility P of a new approach to track discrimination for shipboard IRST sensors.  The proposed approach combines two complementary signal processing technologies; single scan discrimination and an innovative geometry-based technique that accomplishes the equivalent of track-before-detect (TBD) processing using significantly less computation than standard TBD approaches. Our geometry- based TBD process is based on a nonlinear energy maximization procedure that does  not require parallel processing for multiple trajectory hypotheses. Atlantic developed the geometry-based TBD technique in the context of airborne passive missile warning. In this proposed effort, the procedure will be adapted to the problem of target tracking in shipboard IRST sensor data and the concept will be extended to allow the incorporation of multiple target We will assess the utility of both spatial and spectral measures. discriminants, including the set of comprehensive target measures developed by the Navy under the HISS Phase II program, for improved track discrimination performance. The expected gain from TBD methods based on energy  integration is a function of the number of scans N over which the integration is performed, i.e. an SNR increase on the order of (N)112. This fundamental  limit can be exceeded by the proposed geometry-based TED process if the track   extraction is based not only on an energy maximization criteria, but also on additional measures that provide further clutter discrimination. in the. Phase II program, we will refine and optimize the developed track discrimination and perform extensive testing.   This will be followed by the design, fabrication, testing and installation of a prototype real time processor in an IRST system.",

However, the current fuse is ineffective against unpowered air targets whose signature is dominated by warm body thermal emission.  Atlantic Aerospace, a leader in areas of signal processing and multi-spectral infrared phenomenology, has teamed with OptoElectronics, the current manufacturer of the current Mk 404 IR fuse detector assembly, to develop an improved IR fuse under this SBIR.  By developing and using a multi-color detector configuration coupled with a low-cost advanced real-time signal processor (currently being developed by Atlantic Aerospace under a Navy-funded program)-, this program will extend the capability of advanced munitions against low-signature powered and unpowered air targets.  The proposed Multicolor IR Proximity Fuse will also be superior for rejecting countermeasure flares and solar glints.  In Phase I, we will complete a feasibility study for an upgraded multicolor IR proximity fuse detector assembly, capable of being prototyped under Phase II and tested using the signal processor that will be delivered -to NSWC under an existing SBIR Phase II contract.",

Two methodologies (and their supporting mechanisms) are proposed for investigation and development.  The first technology is that of \"Webs\" which provide a method for defining and visualizing the participants, workflows, information flows, and security.  The web concept provides the basis for establishing reference standards at the process and process definition level.  Leveraging the dynamic definition provided by webs, security can be provided dynamically using Security Brokers.  These agents provide dynamic enforcement of security policies on a case-by-case basis.  Security Brokers can be used for system-wide as well as individual control.

        "abstract": "One of the biggest problems faced by both military and non-military personnel in planning and conducting Operations Other Than War (OOTW) and Law Enforcement (LE) is a lack of cultural awareness.  A lack of cultural awareness in OOTW causes misplanning and misinterpretation in the areas of economics, politics, religion, and historical events.  The objective of the proposed work is to produce a design and a prototype which merges key expert system technology with advanced object technology to provide an object-oriented expert system which can embody cultural awareness models in a flexible, adaptable, and robust form.  This expert system can serve as the core \"intelligence\" for SAF which can be included in both Monte Carlo and distributed interactive simulations to provide appropriate responses and interpretation of events based on cultural models.  We propose to couple a hybrid form of expert system with Aurora Simulation's  Object Model Kernel.   The Object Model Kernel will represent all expert system knowledge as object models and enable advanced manipulation of these object models including run-time loading from files or databases, run-time editing, and transfer from other applications.  A single expert system could represent a single, multiple, or an aggregation of entities; or be used as a decision aid for planning and event interpretation.  Anticipated Benefits:  A number of benefits will be realized through the proposed system including, improved fidelity in simulations and exercises involving OOTW/LE; commonality among the cultural model representations used in simulation; reduced maintenance and porting effort to adapt this capability from one system to another; and generally improved planning and execution of OOTW/LE based on cultural awareness.",

The temperature probes   must be specially designed to minimize electromagnetic field   perturbations.  Several types of non-perturbing temperature   measurement probes have been investigated and developed.  Many   employ optical fibers rather than electrical conductors to avoid   the electromagnetic absorption and reflection effects.  Other   probes use very high lead resistances and small enclosed loop areas   to reduce electromagnetic interactions.  Non-perturbing temperature   measurements based on thermographic techniques or measuring the   viscosity of a fluid have also been developed.  The probes used in   this investigation are in widespread usage in research institutes   and are thermistor based sensors with very high resistance leadss.   These are very similar to those described by R. R. Bowman (IEEE   Trans. Microwave Theory Tech MTT 24:43-45, 1976).  Although the   probes are commercially available, an interface is required to   standard laboratory computers.  This effort develops an interface   between the non-perturbing temperature probes and a IBM PC   compatible computer using commercially available components.",

We define an optimal manpower Mix by creating an achievable force structure (or billet plan) that attains the Navy's strategic plan with as few people as possible, given a set of personnel policies. The methodology to develop an optimal manpower mix for Navy personnel is to apply Billet files (existing and proposed) to a network model definition that incorporates personnel policies as constraints.  Current personnel inventories can be applied to the proposed billet structure and examined for conditions that violate policies. A relational database management system is used to load, analyze, and display billet files and personnel policy constraints.  The optimal structure is obtained by applying a rule-based system within the DBMS.  A network-solution model is then used to project the current inventory through the optimal structure to determine where new personnel policies are needed.  Policy analysis is also incorporated into the network post-processor and DBMS which allows for alteration of the personnel inventory and further analysis.",

The work will leverage Aware's state-of-the-art wavelet-based video compression algorithms which are currently being applied to both very low bit rate (< 32 Kbps) video telephony and low-frame rate data link applications. A key benefit of wavelet-based video compression is its scalability in spatial resolution, frame rate, quality, and computational complexity. The work plan consists of 1) trade studies and system development to specify the scalable compressed bit stream, prioritized error correction approach and layered transport protocol, 2) development of clever error localization and error concealment algorithms that are critical in the one-way real-time transmission of video over noisy channels, 3) adaptation and optimization of Aware's wavelet-based video compression algorithm for the one-way channel, 4) an architectural analysis for the cost-effective deployment of the proposed video system on a commercial-off-the shelf PC-based hardware platform.

The goal of this SBIR is to create a visual, interactive, template   based system for developing parallel C3I applications.  This   framework, to be called C3IKIT for C3I Kernels Implemented as   Templates, will have the following characteristics:  a library of   kernel implementations that can be adapted, quickly and with high   quality assurance, for dissimilar architectures; a graphical   interface that allows the library to be searched for appropriate   templates, to parameterize these templates for different   architectures and within different application contexts, that   supports the composition of a kernel with other kernels or C3I applications, and that is extensible to other kernels and parallel   architectures in the C3I domain.  Phase I of this proposal will produce a detailed requirement   analysis of C3IKIT.  To demonstrate feasibility of C3IKIT, we will   develop prototype implementations of two kernel applications from   the C3I Prarllel Benchmark suite (C3IPBS) that is currently under   development at Rome Laboratory.",

As a result, flight control laws have required numerous iterations of an expensive design cycle whereby a controller is developed, tuned, and validated in a lengthy sequence of flight tests and design or parameter changes.  Most adaptive methods that deal with these complexities cannot \"remember\" what they have learned about the aircraft dynamics and are extremely difficult to validate in terms of stability and robustness.  In this proposal, Barron Associates, Inc. describes an unsupervised reinforcement learning (RL) simulation-based control design methodology that can, over time, learn an approximately optimal control strategy for complex systems with minimal analyst involvement.  A controller for both inner-loop and outer-loop pitch-axis control of a fighter aircraft will be developed using the RL algorithm; the evaluation functions required by RL will be approximated using polynomial neural networks (PNNs), and a method for incorporating stability and robustness metrics directly into the RL design process will be investigated.",

        "abstract": "Statistically sound approaches to making interfrences regarding simulation model validation, rather than reliance upon subjective appeal, are needed.  Fundamentally, the question of interest is whether a model reflects reality to the required degree of accuracy.  The utility (and hence validity) of a simulation model relies on how well it captures those aspects of the phenonmenon under study that are relevant application of the simulation.  For this reason, procedures for validating simulation models must be developed in a context specific to the properties of the phenomena intended to be capptured by the model.  The work proposed herein is concerned with the development of multivariate, nonparametric statistical techniques for validation of simulation models.  In particular, we will consider situations in which one or more empirical realizations (i.e., time series) of the phenomena to be modeled are availabble, as well as one or more realizations produced by the simulation model.  Given two such sets of time series, we wish to determine whether the simulated series accurately capture the behavior of the empirical series.  That is, we wish to perform a test of homogeneity.  Two general statistical approaches to this problem will be considered: nonparametric homogeneity testing and change point detection.",

This method of using embedded training to \"self-train\" has been adopted as the prescribed means of accomplishing individual and team proficiency for all surface combatants. For various reasons, embedded training capability on FFG-7 class ships has not been funded.  The most recent initiative, FAST (Frigate AAW System Trainer), proved to be too expensive.  The challenge is to develop an inexpensive on-board team training capability which will encompass the detect-to-engage process and shall include the following equipments: AN/SPS-49 air search radar, AN/SPS-55 surface search radar, MK 92 fire control system, MK12 IFF, and SYS 2 integrated sensor signal processor. The BCI approach will be to leverage ongoing or previously completed development in the areas of: scenario generation and control, data collection, reconstruction analysis & debrief, stimulation, simulation, and advanced embedded training tools & technologies.  Using this other R&D should provide a useful foundation for design analysis in order to produce an on-board training capability within the required limit of $200K per unit.

The technique utilizes the wide frequency band of a single mode optical fiber.  It uses an optical delay line loop to produce a large number of copies of the pulse or pulse train to be measured, so that it can be digitized with a sampling oscilloscope.  Signals from different detectors are fed into the optical ring with different delays to form a long single-shot pulse train, so that one sampling oscilloscope gets all the data. The optical delay line loop sampler can be used as a front end of a sampling oscilloscope to measure transient signals.  This technique will make it possible to record transient phenomena with a bandwidth easily up to 20 GHz or higher.  Phase I will build and bench test the system.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  This project offers a unique diagnostic instrument for measuring very fast transient signals.

Combining AC (and/or DC) electric fields with interactive light control, LEAPS provides a tool set of fundamental operations to control the transport and positioning of particles and biomolecules in a solution confined between two planar electrodes.  In particular, planar colloidal arrays may be formed in designated areas of the electrode surface, and these dynamic plannar arrays may be subjected to operations such as: place-and-hold; translocate; split; merge; etc. This technology permits a novel approach to fluid and matter transport that is functionally integrated with the spatial confinement and concatenation, respectively, of conconccurent and sequential analytical procedures.  The phase I effort will focus on the introduction of an integrated analytical system based on the novel methology of dynamic planar arrays that is native to the planar geometry of on-chip chemical analysis.  A selection of essential functional system components will be demonstrated: in-situ sample purification; mixed-phase activity assay for a critical enzyme in the eucaryotic signal transuction pathway; and the automated, real-time parallel processing of dynamic planar arrays by externally imposed patterns of illumination from a spacially addressable source array.",

Other materials thant tungsten are not only more efficient in producing bremsstrahlung, but have \"characteristic\" x-rays that can make the beam harder instead of softer (as in the case for tungsten).  Today's tubes also do not use optimum angles for the incident electrons for the emerging x-rays.  We propose to optimize materials and angles, not just for the efficiency of producing the x-rays, but for the overall efficiently, taking into account he object being examined and the properties of the detectors.  We will produce a design that increases efficiency and also allows use of a larger fraction of the x-rays (increases soled angle), while taking into account cooling and shielding. Improvement over present tubes is expected to be at least 3:1 and possible more than 10:1.",

(BME) and NASA Ames Research Center (NASA ARC) are developing NASA's aerospace insulation materials for use as an osseous scaffolding to facilitate and support bone wound healing and regeneration.  Fibrous reusable composite insulation (FRCI) developed by NASA for use on the space shuttle was modified to promote bone ingrowth and will be evaluated for its ability to form a living composite.  The program's objective is to determine if the resulting structure of bone and tile are sufficiently strong for medical use.  Initial studies by BME have shown these materials to be biocompatible.  A more porous FRCI-M is has been developed and is sufficiently porous to conduct bone ingrowth and is as strong as the original flight certified materials.  It is estimated that 800,000 patients per year would benefit from a better bone substitute.  This material would be used to treat trauma in civilians and military personnel and to reconstruct bone defects.  Anticipated Benefits:  The military benefits in supporting the development of aerospace ceramics as a bone replacement is improved battlefield trauma care.  The use of advanced aerospace materials in a broad number of applications would reduce the overall cost of radoms, exhaust nozzles, wing flaps and other flight systems that are fabricated from advanced ceramic composites.  Additional manufacturing capability to support medical needs would be available in case of a National emergency.  The private sector would benefit by addressing 1.2 million maxillofacial and musculoskeletal surgical manipulation of bone procedures that could benefit from a synthetic bone.",

Mines contributed a significant percentage of total troop and equipment losses in WWII, Korea, and Vietnam; and mines and other exploded ordnance (UXO) continue killing civilians long after the conflicts themselves have ended.  The lack of effective detector is a major reason for all these losses.  Detectors based on physical properties associated with UXO have been unsuccessful.  Biopraxis offers an entirely new technology, which is not being developed anywhere else in the world, for direct chemically-specific detection of the explosives themselves.  This technology offers the potential for producing a small, rugged, reliable, sensitive, inexpensive explosives detector.  Biopraxis has already collected an extensive body of data which indicates that the concept is indeed feasible.  During Phase I, additional studies will be conducted to demonstrate the technology with explosives found in mines, evaluate potential interferents, and develop data that can be used to predict the performance of ranging from to vehicular-mounted detectors.  By the end of the Phase I, several key components for the mine detector will have been selected.",

        "abstract": "The US Air Force has identified a need to quantify the benefits associated with applying nonlinear estimation techniques to air-launched weapon systems equipped with Inertial Measurement Units (IMU).  Of particular interest is a new technique recently developed by the Air Force, referred to as the State Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE) technique.  The SDRE technique has the potential to achieve IMU transfer alignment and navigation accuracy comparable to (or better than) conventional nonlinear techniques but with a significantly reduced computational burden.  The focus of this proposed research is to:  (1) formulate nonlinear transfer alignment and navigation equations for an air-launched weapon grade IMU, (2) develop candidate nonlinear estimation algorithms, with particular emphasis on the SDRE technique, and (3) conduct simulation-based tradeoff analyses to characterize the benefits of the candidate algorithms.  Detailed mathematical models will be formulated to characterize the nonlinear mechanization equation and linearized error equation for INS-to-IMU transfer alignment and IMU-based navigation candidate nonlinear estimation algorithms will be identified, with particular emphasis on the SDRE and extended Kalman filter algorithms.  The models and algorithms will be incorporated into our existing monte carlo simulation and results will be generated over representative alignment and navigation trajectories.  The simulation results for each candidate estimation algorithm will be contrasted, and the most promising technique will be selected for laboratory and van tests to be conducted under the subsequent Phase II effort.",

In addition to their fluorescent spectral patterns, these two microbes  also have significantly different sizes and shapes which can be detected through an expanded  form of spectrometric analysis in the same Instrument.  In fact, this same instrument with  modifications could be used In the future to diagnose malaria.

        "abstract": "Large quantities of chemical pesticides are used to control plan diseases, rasing environmental and health concerns.  Biological fungicides are needed as alternatives to chemical pesticides, especially for crops receiving heavy chemical applications.  However, biofungicides require special formulation to be consistently effective, affordable and compatible with standard practices. \n\nWe are developing spray formulations of biofungicide for control of fruit and foliar diseases, but formulation development is needed.  Fruit and turf diseases are important targets for biocontrol.  For grapes, over $100 million is spent annually for dicarboximide fungicides for Botrytis control, and resistance is developing.  Golf courses receive over $90 million in fungicides in the U. S. alone, exposing the general public to potentially anti-androgenic fungicides and contaminating surrounding surface waters.  Our biofungicides have been effective in the field, but control is inconsistent due to inadequate formulation adjuvants and incompatibility with chemical residues in spray equipment.\n\nThe proposed work will test formulation adjuvants as nutritive spreader/stickers, which have been shown to be critically important.  Also, dose ranging, compatibility with chemicals, and spray tank decontamination procedures will be tested.  A production facility has been build; the proposed work will finalize product development in preparation for commercial product introduction.",

This engine has a mechanical distributor type fuel pump and indirect fuel injection.  It is proposed to convert the engine to a full-authority digital fuel injection system by replacing the original fuel injectors and fuel pump and adding an electronic control unit and an EGR valve.  Reduction of exhaust smoke requires an early end of injection of fuel and reduction of NOx, unburned HC, and CO emissions requires retarded start of injection.  Therefore, to reduce both smoke and NOx, while maintaining a low BSFC, the fuel injection duration must be short with a high rate of injection.  The proposed system with digital electronic control meets both of these requirements and precisely time the injection to minimize exhaust emissions.",

As a consequence of these operating conditions, unnecessarily high temperature and flame speeds are acheived and the system suffers from a loss of available energy, at a considerable penalty in fuel economy, as well as generating unnecessarily high levels of exhaust pollutants. The objective is to develop real time control of the actual combustion event in order to optimize both fuel efficiency and the reduction of pollutants.  This will require an investigation into new sensor and actuator technologies as well as control techniques based on neural network concepts.  Although neural network control is applicable to an engine utilizing conventional diesel combustion technology, it is particularly beneficial when combined with a truly lean burning mixture and the concept of Direct Injection Stratified Charge Combustion (DISCC).",

This solution includes a number of innovative features including:  enclosed conductive polymer bilayer pumping mechanisms operated in air, field driven assemblies for particle trapping and detector isolation and voltage driven steady release reservoir capsules for pretreatment of incoming particles.  In Phase I we propose to design, fabricate and lab test an automated air-to-liquid sampler that integrates elements previously developed by BOMEC investigators.  Field-testing of pre-production sampler prototypes in conjunction with our corporate partners is proposed for a Phase II effort.  Commercial, industrial, law enforcement and military applications of the microfabri- cated air sampler are envisioned.  The company will lead a team composed of BOMEC Inc., MIT, the University of Utah, Attwood Technology and Lockheed/Martin-INEL in developing and commercializing this technology.  Design and testing of the sampler prototypes will be done in collaboration with the US Army TECOM facility at Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah.",

This methodology will be extensible to address multiple airborne platforms and multiple target scenarios in the future.  During the first part of Phase 1, the relevant target search principles and requirements, data sources, and air vehicle capabilities and limitations for performing an optimal target search will be researched and selected based on the user-defined problem.  During the second part of  Phase I, the extracted data and optimal search techniques will be used to develop a preliminary prototype of the Search for Mobile And Relocatable Targets (SMART) Module that will execute on equipment consistent with Navy combat computer architectures.  BONN believes that careful knowledge engineering with experienced users can establish the true nature of the problem.  Only from a thorough understanding of the problem can the developer build an effective algorithm. Applying academic solutions to operational problems is a nice exercise, but useful solutions must properly address the tactical and operational considerations encountered in the battle arena.",

        "abstract": "Phase conjugation, discovered over 20 years ago, now has a wide assortment of applications. However, phase conjugation requires that the medium in which the phase conjugation takes place in be lossless. Based on recent preliminary research for which it is anticipated a patent will be applied for, it now appears possible for a limited though important class of materials to extend the phase conjugation concept to loss or gain. Specifically, the loss or gain medium must be first order, that is have a symplectic matrix representation. Prototypical devices satisfying this condition are Gaussian apertures, Gaussian ducts, and Gaussian \"lasers\". It has been proved recently that any first order system with loss or gain can be modeled exactly using such devices, which indicates that a phase conjugator for loss or gain can indeed be built, at least in principle. It is easy to show mathematically that for first order systems this generalized phase conjugation reduces to just ordinary phase conjugation when the system is lossless.",

Fluoropolymers with elevated glass transition temperatures greater than 150 degrees C, addressing the crucial thermal limitation of present POF technology.  Fluoropolymers are also capable of much lower light attenuation compared to hydrogen based polymers with attenuation's down to 60 dB/Km or less, and also can exhibit low moisture absorption.  In addition, this method of obtaining a graded refractive index in the fiber is particularly able to provide enhanced radiation resistance to the fiber.  This program will in addition explore the development of improved coatings which will protect the GIPOF from temperatures of -40 degrees C to +150 degrees C and moisture ingress, and which are tolerant to low earth orbit.",

        "abstract": "Pattern recognition systems using optical correlation are being developed.  The optical correlator is a powerful tool since it simultaneously processes large data arrays.  This capability reduces data handling and process control, makes the system less susceptable to obstruction and increases throughput.  An optical correlator is also a phase sensitive detector.  It can read an optical phase mask and determine if the mask contains a valid code.  The phase code is not visible to the eye or ordinary visual sensors such as copiers, scanners or CCD cameras.  Optical phase encryption adds another level of security since the patterns are difficult to copy.  This proposal describes cost-reduction techniques for the part validation and security verification problem.  A major expense in optical pattern recognition systems is the I/O devices such as spatial light modulators, preprocessors, post-processors, and fast-framing CCD arrays.  By eliminating electronic processing of large input and output arrays, it is possible to greatly reduce the I/O costs.",

        "abstract": "In the proposed research we will investigate methods for improving the performance of very long wavelength infrared (VLWIR) photovoltaic detectors fabricated from Hg1-xMnxTe. This material was chosen because Hg1-xMnxTe has been shown to have superior mechanical, chemical and thermal stability compared Hg1-xCdxTe.  During previously SBIR-BMDO funded work, Brimrose Corporation successfully fabricated Hg1-xMnxTe detectors with cutoff wavelengths of 15.5 microns at 77 K, RoA performance in excess of 0.02Qcm2 and minority carrier lifetimes of 1 microsecond. The bulk Hg1-xMnxTe crystals were grown using the travelling heater method (TJM). Further purification of the starting materials and processing techniques along with a substantial reduction in diode thickness is expected to improve these parameters such that the minority carrier lifetimes approach the Auger limits. Therefore, we propose liquid phase epitaxial growth (LPE) of Hg1-xMnxTe layers on lattice matched Hg1-xMnxTe substrates via the tipping and dipping techniques to fabricate very thin n on p photodetectors. We will also investigate extensive methods for further purification of the starting materials and the solutions necessary for LPE growth.  Phase I of this project will investigate the feasibility of such improvements. After these improvements have been successfully demonstrated, optimization of the growth techniques and the development of linear and focal plane arrays will be the focus of phase II. Subsequent to the phase II program, results of this research will be commercialized.",

Using vanadium doped zinc telluride, we will fabricate an electro-optic power limiter (EOPL) that operates at visible wavelengths.  The approach of using a doped II-VI semiconductor for power limiting was previously demonstrated by Dr. Steiers research group at the Center for Photonics Technology at the University of Southern California [ref. 1 of proposal].  In close collaboration with the U.S.C. group, Brimrose has developed various transition metal doped II-VI compounds for photorefractive optical image processing.  Recently, we have developed a concept of tailoring these materials for optical limiting applications.  By controlling material processing parameters, material with improved response time and increased sensitivity will be produced.  It has already been established that the damage threshold of ZnTe:V is superior to that of its organic and polymeric competitor materials.  A limiter fabricated from this material will be compact and light as well as simple in operation without requiring the extensive or complex external optical systems that are typically required in conventional optical limiters.  The device will exhibit low threshold with a response time in submicroseconds.  Most importantly, it will simultaneously block a high intensity jamming beam of laser radiation while still transmitting the desired low intensity image.",

The end-effectors will contain microsensors providing force-feedback to the user.

        "abstract": "A ground penetrating radar (GPR) with advanced processing techniques   is proposed  for unmanned aerial vehicle mounting.  The radar will have two modes of functioning:  (A) detection mode, and (B) imaging mode.  Precise position accuracy is required  for a gridwork of multiple probings and GPS P-Code can provide sub-meter location  accuracy.  The system design will take advantage of recent developments in antennas,  receivers and parallel processors.  The receivers planned are bulk acousto-optic  devices and two-dimensional CCD arrays which enable autocorrelation of the received  signals preserving the waveshape of the same.  Whereas previous approaches have been  affected by clutter, the proposed design will be based on a BSEI patent for signal  crafting and optimization of impulse radar (issuing 1995), which is a design for  obviating clutter.  A key feature of this clutter obviating approach is that the pulse  is matched to the target or class of targets.  Object recognition is achieved by  wavelet processing of the return and pattern matching.  Three methods will be explored  for increasing range.  During Phase I a prototype test GPR configuration will be  designed and laboratory tests of the energy crafting approach conducted.  In Phase II  a prototype will be designed, fabricated and tested.",

Thus there is a need to identify materials which might substitute for hazardous materials in batteries.  Since the trend is towards new and more efficient power sources, material substitutions must be done without sacrificing energy or power density. The proposed approach utilizes a combination of conductive polymers enclosed in a biodegradable case.  Through computer modeling, electrically and ionically conductive structures are first identified as promising. These are then synthesized and their chemical and electrochemical properties compared with predictions. Demonstration of the degradation of the better choices of battery anode, cathode and electrolyte materials is achieved through following their degradation experimentally when the proposed biodegradable battery is tested in natural seawater.",

        "abstract": "Sub-Miniaturized Telemetry (SMT), Global Positioning System (GPS) packages and associated accessories are frequently bonded to missile and aircraft for flight testing and removed.  Removing typical aerospace adhesives from metallic and composite substrates often requires high heat, solvents, abrasion or other potentially damaging forces.  The proposed adhesive system seeks to provide simple bond application and removal procedures through the incorporation of a thermally activated debonding agent.  This agent will be applied at the adhesive-substrate interface and at normal operating temperatures will not affect the integrity of the bonded structure.  When disassembling, the application of heat in excess of the agent's critical temperature will result in clean disbondment of the adhered parts.  The experimental part of this effort will involve preparing the novel thermal release agents and applying them with commerical aerospace adhesives.  The feasibility of the concept will be tested by bonding simulated GPS modules on coated aircraft alloys and composites, measuring initial bond strength and debonding by heat the bondline above the critical temperature.  The characteristics of the adhesive, thermal release additives, and processing methods will be also defined for this application.",

        "abstract": "The need to identify the kinetic energy transferred by warhead fragments is critical to weapon effectiveness analysis.  Moreover, it is necessary to identify the spacial distribution of the energy to establish the likelihood of impact.  Current warhead fragment measurement techniques employ a \"bundle\" particle capture mechanism for spacial distribution and mass measurement, and a totally separate velocity gate screen technique to determine velocity.  These methods are incapable of simultaneously measuring velocity, trajectory, and mass of the same fragment.  They also suffer from other limitations that limit the usefulness of the data obtained.  This project evaluates the feasibility of using advanced Doppler based radar processing techniques in combination with the \"bundle\" technique for capturing fragments to uniquely identify the velocity, trajectory, and mass of warhead fragments.  A contractor furnished radar system will be integrated with the government Vulnerability and Lethality Testing System (VALTS) located in Eglin, FL to obtain test data.  This data will then be analyzed to establish processing technique resolution capabilities at the frequency of the contractor furnished radar.  The results of this analysis will then be used to develop specifications for a Phase II SBIR fragment tracking demonstration system.",

        "abstract": "As identified in the SBIR announcement, virtual environment technologyhas found widespread use in the military in applications related to the recreation of a photo realistic display.  The SBIR announcement further recognizes that a significant need exists for aids in developing skills for managing complex situations which are best addressed at a more abstract level.  The current proposal seeks to address this need by adapting human immersion concepts and virtual environment technology normally associated with real world display to the more subtle requirements of complex mission management rehearsal.  By allowing a trainee to view, navigate, and interact with an abstract virtual world, more substantial information regarding the subject matter can be imparted.   The proposed effort has 2 technical objectives.  The first is the identification of requirements inherent in using commercial off the shelf (COTS) hardware and software that will allow for the development of a military and non-military immersed virtual environment mission rehearsal system.  The second is the establishment of functional system specifications and recommendations for specific COTS hardware and software.  Performance of the proposed program will serve as a necessary step toward the development of a protype mission rehearsal system.  CASDE experience in the practical aspects fo military modeling, simulation, and virtual environments, supplemented by the extensive computer science expertise of Professor James Hahn of George Washington University, will ensure a thorough and successful completion of the proposed study.  Completion of the proposed program will form the initial step in development of an immersed virtual reality based system for complex mission rehearsal.  The primary military benefit of such a system is anticipated to be a revolutionary breakthrough in techniques for system management training.  In particular, the application of immersed virtual reality to an abstract virtual environment is expected to significantly aid in imparting a higher level of conceptual understanding.  Both warfighting and peace time benefits are to be expected.",

Target material characteristics are: less than aluminum heat sinks, thermal conductivity at least 200 W/m-k, and mass density less than aluminum.  To address this objective, Cast Metal Composites, Inc. will produce lightweight, high thermal conductivity, graphite reinforced aluminum and/or polymer matrix composite materials using our unique high pressure infiltration process.  Two or three composite materials will be selected for sample manufacture based on the projected cost of the materials and on analytical modeling and computer simulation results.  The effect of variations in reinforcement type, volume fraction, orientation, and properties on the resultant composite material properties will be studied.  Candidate reinforcement materials will include discontinuous (milled or chopped) pitch graphite fibers, vapor grown carbon filaments, and two-dimensional and three-dimensional porous carbon-carbon materials.  During Phase I, coupon samples of the composite materials will be produced and physical properties will be measured.  This work will support the development of detailed material development plan that will be pursued in Phase II.  A final report will be submitted at the end of the Phase I effort.",

Currently, there is no commercially available lattice matched substrate for GaN or related III-V nitrides, although all researchers agree the availability of these substrate is critical. The development and optimization of high power electronics and optoelectronics based on GaN will require a dramatic reduction in the epitaxial material defect density, and this dramatic reduction will be achieved through the use of a lattice matched substrate. To form a lattice matched native substrate, 100 to 200 um thick GaN will be deposited on a sacrificial substrate to form an unstrained, lattice matched pseudo-substrate of GaN. This work has been achieved in several laboratories and has been used to produce some of the best epitaxial GaN. However, the GaN pseudo-substrates have rough surfaces, nonuniform thickness and are small in size. Using phase I support, CBL proposes to improve uniformity, surface flatness, and piece size. CBL Co. has developed proprietary techniques to increase the GaN substrate size by reducing or eliminating substrate cracking upon cooling. GaN substrates are critical to a fully developed high power electronics and optoelectronics technology, and CBL has the ability to provide these substrates to military and commercial end users.",

The general approach which has been taken toward this problem is to utilize a portion of incoming combustor air for film-cooling of the liner.  This proposal deals with a cooling technique for combustor liners which does not utilize film cooling.  Instead, a special liner design is employed which enables incident heat to be absorbed by incoming combustor air.  The innovative combustor liner cooling concept provides a more uniform temperature distribution in the combustor exit gas, and permits effective liner cooling even when film-cooling techniques are inadequate.  Project objectives are: to establish design characteristics of the combustor liner, to assess the feasibility of the innovative liner cooling technique, and to identify research and development needs. Design and performance studies will be performed, a conceptual liner cooling system design will be prepared, and key problem areas will be evaluated.  It is expected that results will verify the technical attractiveness of the new liner cooling concept, and its applicability to military and civilian turboshaft and other gas turbine applications.",

        "abstract": "In achieving the dual-use turbo-shaft engine performance improvements specified in the HPTET initiative the use of advanced ceramic materials in the hot gas flowpath play a crucial role. Increased turbine inlet temperatures, and the attendant increase in un-cooled turbine blade material temperatures, enable the dramatic increases in specific power and thermal efficiency.  In addition to increased turbine inlet temperature, the designer must provide minimal (near zero) turbine blade tip clearances to minimize tip leakage and the resulting losses in stage efficiency.  Many variables control the hot operating tip clearances within a turbine engine and they difficult to analyze with consistent precision without model calibration from empirical engine data.  Often the best data is not sufficiently accurate to prevent a \"rub\" from occurring between the turbine blade and the stationary shroud.  In the case of a ceramic turbine blade severe damage may occur when a \"rub\" occurs but no data exists in the public domain to verify this conclusion.  This program proposes to empirically determine if damage occurs to a candidate monolithic ceramic turbine blade material when subjected to \"rub\" incursions with a candidate high temperature abradable shroud coating material.  The program consists of eight test with four variables organized in a Taguchi L(8) orthogonal array.  The tests will be performed to conditions recommended by both Allied Signal Engines and Allison Gas Turbine Division and based upon analytically predicted conditions within their ATTAP engine test beds.  Testing will occur at the Solar Turbines, Inc. test facilities on an existing hot turbine rub rig.  Ceramic test specimens, designed with similarity to MIL-STD 1942-(B) flexure bars, will be flexure tested at Allied Signal Engines to determine retained strength at room temperature following exposure to the recommended \"rub\" testing conditions.",

Each new generation of   air interface embodies increasingly sophisticated signal modulation   schemes providing improved spectrum utilization and network   capacity.  Today, a state-of-the-art commercial digital Cellular   Telephone system based upon the US IS-95 air interface standard is   available.  This system uses Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)   which has its roots in the demanding Military environment.  the   CDMA approach combines direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS)   modulation for superior RF spectrum utilization, inherent privacy,   soft handoffs of mobile subscribers between cells, low probability   ofinterception and detection, processing gain and forward error   correction, and multipath immunity.  The significant advantages of   this comercial CDMA technology can be relaized in the battlefield   environment by placing appropriate Cellular Telephone base station   functions in an Unmanned Vehicle's payload.  By judicious   apportionment o fthe functions among the Unmanned Vehicle's system   elements, each Unmanned Vehicle equipped with the Cellular   Telephone Payload will constitute a robust communications cell on   the battefield providing auytonomous intr-cell connectivity to   mobile subscribers.  the result will be secure, real-time voice,   data, mixed voice and data, FAX, and imagery coomunicated between   widely dispersed friendly forces on the battlefield with capability   to conenct the Unmanned Vehicle's Cellular Network to worldwide   telephone assets and MIlitary communications networks.",

        "abstract": "The proposed experimental program demonstrates the technical feasibility of growing single crystals of technologically important ceramics by the solid state method.  The proposed method relies on discontinuous grain growth which is often regarded as undesirable and deleterious during the sintering of many ceramics.  In order to demonstrate the technical feasibility and versatility of the solid state method, we propose to grow single crystals of a relaxor lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate solid solution exhibiting many attractive properties for dielectric and electrostrictive applications.  A single crystal will be produced by contacting a dense polycrystalline ceramics exhibiting discontinuous grain growth to a single crystal seed.  This assembly will be heated at a temperature lower than the critical temperature for the onset of discontinuous grain growth.  Single crystals, which are grown by the solid state method at temperatures substantially lower than their melting points, grow as the seed crystals consume grains in polycrystalline ceramics.  Thus, the method is ideal for single crystal growth of ceramics having one or more components with high vapor pressure at elevated temperatures.  Furthermore, because the solid state method does not require any expensive and complicated apparatuses, these single crystals cost less than those grown by conventional melt growth methods.",

However, none of these initiatives have addressed the design of sensing systems which are crucial to the operation and efficiency of feedback control systems.  The Phase I effort will focus on developing advanced physical models for sensors, i.e., virtual sensors.  Models will be developed for sensors based on interferometric methods (such as IR laser interferometry and fourier transform interferometry) and will be tested on an existing virtual reactor environment developed at CFDRC (through DARPA programs).  The study will be used to determine (i) combination of sensors required to diagnose the desired quantity non-intrusively, (ii) location of sensors in the virtual reactor, (iii) sensor accuracy and response characteristics, and, (iv) data fusion methodologies to extract the desired information from multiple sensor input data.  The performance of the sensing system will be quantified on a typical Rapid Thermal Processing (RTP) system for the fabrication of semiconductor devices.  In Phase II, the effort will be extended to a wider range of sensors based on other non-invasive interferometry methods such as in-situ ellipsometer, thin film interferometer, etc.  The virtual sensor will be coupled with virtual controllers to demonstrate the complete real-time control system on fabrication reactors.  This effort will be coordinated with the DARPA initiative on Virtual Integrated Prototyping (VIP) for thin films which will focus on model development, model reduction and model based control systems for on-line control of fabrication equipment and processes.",

This framework will be applicable to individual algorithms, groups of algorithms, and whole ATR suites. For the ATR evaluator, it offers the ability to predict the potential for performance improvement in a given algorithm or suite, without having to fully implement it. For the ATR designer,  it offers the ability to optimize free parameters of algorithms and provide guidance on where algorithms  can be optimized individually and where nonlinear relations between algorithms require them to be  optimized together. Our proposed solution is centered on a systematic analysis of current state-of-the-art ATR methods in order to determine commonalities between algorithms in terms of input types, output  types, and performance criteria. A taxonomy of ATR methods is used as a knowledge base for modeling algorithm input and output types, and determining performance criteria. Once performance as a function of algorithm parameters has been determined, optimization is performed.  A limited software prototype will be implemented and applied to one ATR suite for feasibility demonstration, to be followed up in Phase II with a full scale implementation and validation applicable to a range of algorithms.",

Expert systems will provide a framework for the system and give it the capacity to emulate the expert human reasoning heuristics, coordinate overall SA functions, and support numerical and symbolic processing algorithms.  Bayesian belief networks will be used to incorporate uncertain data from multiple (and possibly conflicting) sources into the situation assessment, and provide the framework for computing the most likely hypothesis for explaining and making sense of a set of observed tactical situation templates and libraries to be used for interpreting new battlefield activities, events, and observations.  Our proposed Phase I study will focus on demonstration and feasibility analysis of a hybrid system for battleifeld situation assessment.

These views are linked to a simulation facility that can support the manipulation, visualization, amd analysi of COA alternatives.  Our approach is motivated by the need to provide decision support in areas that are difficult for humans, namely, tracking multi-dimensional information, visualizing abstract situational features, managing uncertainity, detecting conflicts and constraint violations, and action/reaction gaming and outcome assessment.  The proposed workstation will provide the commander with the ability to view a situation from multiple perspectives and to traverse related displays by following hyperlinks connecting related entities.

A methodology is needed for presenting the  critical information in a situationally-relevant manner, to support the commander's visualization of the battlefield and assessment of tactical alternatives.  We propose a hybrid solution combining model-based simulation with evidential reasoning to provide the needed integration and abstraction of battlefield information.  The proposed system consists of two principle components: An evidential/knowledge-based reasoning and prediction (ERP) module for: a) data integration, filtering, and abstraction; b) situation assessment; and c) course-of-action (COA) projection.  A model-based simulation (MBS) module for maintaining a dynamic battlefield database and projecting the expected COA into the future.  The ERP module's situation hypothesis set is fed to a case-based reasoning algorithm that projects the current situation into the future, using experience-based outcome prediction.  This prediction drives the MBS module, which provides three key functions: 1) maintenance of battlefield information in a central database; 2) visualization of battlefield data at user-defined levels of abstraction via graphical user interface; and 3) faster-than-real-time detailed simulation of the current situation.",

Expected advances in high performance parallel desktop computer hardware provide  the potential to automatically screen large numbers of high-resolution images at  a reasonable cost.  To harness this potential, we propose to design and prototype  a software system that preprocesses images, then performs multiple different  image transforms and feature extraction methods in parallel, and finally  classifies image areas at multiple levels of discrimination based on the pool of  extracted features.  We will prototype parallel algorithms for a number of  transforms (such as Gabor, wavelet, and Hough) and feature extraction methods  (such as fractal dimension, entropy and other pixel gray level statistics).  Wherever it is applicable, we will use features that are invariant to  translation, rotation, and scale in the image plane.  For classification, we will  use a hierarchy of state-of-the-art neural network classifiers.  We have already  proven the feasibility and computational efficiency of this approach in  automatic target recognition; we expect the main benefits to carry over to the  domain of automatic image screening: extremely rapid training, self-organizing  architecture, and ability to handle large numbers of classification labels.",

Pressureless sintering of B4C by microwave resulted the final products with high density and high mechanical strength in a much faster sintering rate (10 to 50 times faster) than the conventional process.  The internal heating and enhancement of diffusion by microwave can lowe the reaction temperature and increase the reaction rate for carbothermal reduction.  By microwave heating, reaction-sintering of B4C by carbothermal reduction of B2O3 become possible.  By using a carbon fiber preform (either carbon fiber weaves or carbon/resin composite) that interact strongly with microwave to melt B2O3, B4C can be formed by carbothermal reduction, and B4C fiber weaves can be achieved.  A glassy phase can than be filled in to the pores followed by a controlled crystallization to convert to a glass-ceramic matrix.  This microwave-induced B4C fiber-reinforced glass-ceramic armor tile should have a density lower than the conventional B4C ceramic tiles with the equal or even better ballistic strength.  Many studies on microwave processing and our preliminary results further indicate the feasibility.

High Surface area activated carbon represents a typical material for double-layer capacitance, while Ru0(2) is the best example of pseudocapacitance. Extensive efforts have been devoted to the development of electrochemical capacitors based on either activated carbon or Ru0(2). However, both materials have their disadvantages and limitations. Activated carbon has high surface area, but its double-layer capacitance is low. In addition, a large portion of the surface area is non-accessible to the electrolyte. It is difficult to achieve high energy density with activated carbon as the electrode material. With the conventional processing technology, it is difficult to make Ru0(2) with high surface area. More importantly, Ru0(2) is too expensive to be used for large scale commercial applications. Phase I will fabricate high surface area aerogels of low cost and conductive metal oxides as electrode materials for capacitive energy storage cells. We expect that electrochemical capacitors made from the aerogel materials will have light weight, high energy density, long life cycle, and low cost.",

        "abstract": "Microwave sintering of ceramics has many advantages compared to the conventional process, for example, reduction in manufacturing costs and processing times, improving product uniformity, microstructures, properties, and yield.  By using a novel process with microwave to press the B4C preform that is effectively heated by microwave, fully dense B4C can be achieved at very short process time.  A simple cold pressing equipment can be used to achieve this process, capital cost of the production can be dramatically reduced.  The production time will also be reduced by using microwave heating.  The proposed idea can be achieved by four approaches, (1) uniaxial pressing, (2) pseudoisostatic pressing, and (3) hot isostatic pressing (HIP).  Anticipated Benefits:  If the proposed research is successful, the microwave pressure sintering process will provide a low cost technology to make dense boron carbide ceramics.  The microwave pressure sintering can also be applied on many applications beside boron carbide.  The applications areas include refractory ceramics, ceramic cermets, composites, et al..  In addition, many new material systems that were not available or hard to achieve by conventional techniques can be designed and fabricated by this technique.",

The TARS program is  developing a low cost telemetry using COTS components and pressure tolerant potted  assemblies.  It is totally compliant with telecommitactions industry standards for  data transmission using SONET and ATM.  Shipboard electronics cost and complexity have  been dramatically reduced by elimination of the traditional towed array receiver and  its replacement with a COTS SONET/AIIM Switch that can also serve as the nerve center  for signal processing data flaw.  The TARS telemetry and associated developments allows the Navy to re-apply all of the  acoustic, mechanical, and handling system experience and hardware gained over the years  by repackaging the TARS telemetry to fit within the existing electronics space for sub-  marine applications.  Smaller diameter or longer surface ship arrays that reuse existing  handling system would also result  During Phase 1, sizing studies will be done that determine the minimum diameter that can  be accommodated using COTS components for the Node, HUB, and Fiber Optics.  Applicability  of the TARS approach to long, small diameter arrays will be confirmed.  Studies will be  conducted to show both the diameter and length reductions that can be accomplished using  more advanced packaging techniques such as MTM (multi-chip modules).  A cost-benefits  tradeoff will be prepared as the basis for continuation during Phase..-II.",

        "abstract": "In response to the recent Navy trend toward organizational  structures which decentralize and distribute decision-making in  both tactical and non-tactical environments.  CHI Systems proposes  to develop a general tool for analyzing distributed decision-making  and information processing.  The research proposed is based on over ten years of efforts in  which the Principal Investigator and colleagues at CHI Systems have  developed, and demonstrated a methodology for decision analysis  called Cognitive Limit Extension Methodology (CLEM) and a related  modeling toolset called COGNET (COGnition as a NEtwork of Tasks).  The research proposed will further extend these proven techniques  to deal with analysis and design of distributed decision-making.  The  result will be a genera, powerful tool for modeling and analyzing  distributed decision-making and information processing, and for  constraint-based diagnosis and design of distributed  decision-making systems.  The primary Phase I goal is to determine the feasibility of  extending the existing CLEM methodology and COGNET toolset to meet  the need for a flexible, general, and automated tool to model  distributed decision-making in complex environments, and to design  optimized (distributed) decision systems.  This goal is pursued  through four specific objectives (each a task of the Phase I  effort) plus one option task objective.",

        "abstract": "Computer-based training has primarily focused on the acquisition and   application of  procedural knowledge, emphasizing development of skilled performance of tasks.  In  many important Naval roles, however, the ability to apply more general concept to  specific novel problems is even more important than procedural skills.  Sonar  operators, who must reason about acoustic oceanography and sensor/signal processors,  are primary examples.  While the Navy has begun to develop concept-oriented trainers  (such as IMAT) for classroom training, there is still a great need for methods and  tools to train students in the employment of conceptual knowledge in realistic  mission settings.  The proposed research addresses this need by initiating research  and development of a Concept Employment Trainer or CET, directed at the training  application of underwater acoustical concepts to reasoning about subsurface sonar  signals.  The proposed CET uses graphical visualizations embedded in scenario-based  problems to link classroom concepts with naturalistic problems, and also provides  tools for instructors to generate scenario conditions that will require application  of specific pieces or combinations of concepts.  CET also provides trainee  evaluation and procedural help.  The Phase I research is accomplished in four tasks,  and results in a demonstration prototype of the CET.",

The goal of this program is to develop a compact front-end source plus encoder that allow the exploitation of the 30 THZ bandwidth of long-haul optical fibers.  Our Phase I program focuses on the demonstration of acousto-optic pulse shaping techniques for high-speed encoding.  In the Phase II we will combine our compact ultrafast fiber lasers (developed in collaboration with MIT and AT&T) with the acousto-optics techniques demonstrated during the initial Phase.  We will study cost effective ways to produce compact and reliable Tbits per second sources that are compatible with existing long-haul fiber networks. Our program goals will be reached in collaboration with Professor Warren Warren (Princeton University). A brief listing of applications includes: ultrabroadband communication and coherent control of matter.",

The analysis process will consider the hardface coating, fusing,and heat treatment of the arresting hooks.  The modeling approach uses separate finite element software packages to analyze the thermal (FIDAP) and residual stress formation (NIKE3D).  A unique one-dimensional surface element will be developed that can be used for the analysis of all processing steps, thermal or stress related.  The innovative surface element interfaces with each of the analysis packages.  The one-dimensional surface element models the spray deposition, heat transfer, and residual stress levels in a manner that requires less memory and computational time.  Phase I will demonstrate that the proposed modeling approach is capable of modeling all relevant steps of the manufacturing process.  Technical objectives of Phase I include the development o the one-dimensional surface element, implementation of the stress model, the integration of the thermal and stress analyses, and the analysis of process steps. Meeting these objectives results in a smooth transition to refinements in the models and improvements during the manufacturing process in Phase II.",

This proposal is to develop and study a new type ECG electrode with annular rings and on board amplifier which will compensate for artifacts induced at the electrode site while amplifying the true patient signal.  Cost reduction will be accomplished since part of the electrode is reusable.  In addition, a repeatable means for mounting or suspending the electrodes on the patient (subject) will be developed and studied, preferably utilizing a reusable \"Tee Shirt\" garment.  Anticipated Benefits:  Military Benefits:  In combat, this project will solve the need to quickly apply sensors with minimal prep time and monitor the ECG of the wounded without artifact.  Also, the need to monitor EKG's in flight or simulation training for observation purposes, with extreme human compliance.

        "abstract": "Cylindrical non-axisymmetric optical components are becoming increasingly important to both commercial and military applications.  Current manufacturing methods are very labor intensive and require dedicated tooling.  This resulted in a major shift of manufacturing base to off shore manufacturers.  Recent advances in Deterministics Microgrinding of spherical surfaces demonstrate that specular surfaces can be produced at low costs and short leadtime.  Fabrication and finishing of cylinders using Deterministic Microgrinding will provide the ability to produce cylindrical optics in time frames never before possible at costs well below current values.  Successful implementation of this technology will help regain the lost leadership in this sector of the optics industry.  This proposal will determine the feasibility of applying DMG & Finishing to  produce cylindrical non-axisymmetric optical surfaces.  The first series of tasks will address issues of motion. Then different removal patterns will be predicted for various tool movements.  The second series of tasks are focused around the study of how the machining center, work holding and cutting tool configurations can change the demands on the mechanical components that will constrain the movements.  The last set of tasks will model the findings of the first tasks and compare predicted with simulation and experimental results.",

The advances made in the last few years with the OPTICAM family of products has lead to significant breakthroughs in the initial step of fabrication of aspheric surfaces.  The elements are ready to polish after coming off the OPTICAM machines.  However polishing requires highly skilled artisans and is very costly and time consuming.  This proposal will provide the basis for a system to polish the aspheric surface without special tooling.  The method proposed will allow for differential removal across the surface to be polished thus giving the operator the ability to accurately control the surface figure.  The method will also work on spherical surfaces as well.  Anticipated Benefits:  The need for cost effective, precision aspheres and other symmetric (including spherical) optical components is evident throughout the military and commercial markets.  This proposal will provide the ability to manufacture aspheres cost effectively.",

This information can be used   to aid decisions for flight maneuvers, and to avoid or mitigate the   stresses associated with windshear encounters.  The Phase I effort   will evaluate the potential of candidate lidar configurations and   will structure a development plan for a scanning Doppler lidar wake   hazard detection, display, and warning system suitable for use on   military and commercial aircraft.  Detection performance, cockpit   display and warning systems, and production cost are considered to   be the prime parameters to be quantified during Phase I.

These conductivities are two to four times those of the aluminum alloys currently used for spacecraft structure.  However, the composites have very low thermal conductivities ( 2 W/m degree K) in the through-thickness direction (k33) because of the low transverse conductivity of the highly-crystalline graphite fibers and the low isotropic conductivity of the epoxy or cyanate ester matrix resins.  While the low k33 values do not prevent the composite from thermally outperforming aluminum when the structures are \"thin\" (thickness/in-plane thermal path length, t/L less than or equal to 0.01, Ref. 1), higher k33 values would further increase performance and greatly broaden the range of applications where the 40% weight savings of composites (versus aluminum) could be invoked.  This Phase I work will screen for and select a polymer modification approach to increasing the k33 values of a thermally conductive graphite composite and an adhesive, assess the effects of the modification on critical thermal, mechanical, and physical properties of composite and adhesive, and validate performance enhancement in a baseline hardware article.",

This effort is an extension of previous research on English language systems by this research group, and represents the first of several evaluations for other languages.  One spectral-template based recognizer and two Hidden Markov Model (HMM) recognizers from different developers will be evaluated.  The evaluation will benchmark recognizer accuracy in distinguishing between very similar Spanish words and will also determine the recognizers' capability to provide evaluative feedback of pronunciation accuracy in speech-training tasks.  A prototype multimedia pronunciation-training system will be developed for native English speakers who are learning Spanish.  This system will use the speech recognition technology determined to be most successful in distinguishing between intelligible and unitelligible Spanish.  In Phase II a fully developed Spanish pronunciation training system with a wide variety of speech production and speech perception training drills will be produced.  The same procedures will be applied to the design of modules for additional languages.  These systems will have broad commercial and military applicability.  Anticipated Benefits:  Research and development on low-cost language trainers will contribute directly to efforts in the military to support multinational or multilingual operations.

At present, there is considerable interest in obtaining measurements of fuel and air motions in both fuel droplet and solid particle combustors since the velocity of the fuel relative to the gas strongly influences the local oxygen supply, the removal of combustion products, and hence the fuel burning rate and pollution formation.  However, our present understanding of the details of the interaction between the fluid dynamic and chemical processes does not permit us to predict the effects of specific changes in operating conditions.  This lack of understanding is primarily due to the complex nature of fuel spray combustion which involves simultaneous heat, mass, and momentum transfer, and chemical reactions which are all influenced by fuel type, ambient gas composition, temperature and pressure,and the fuel droplet or particle size distribution.  To alleviate these problems it is proposed to develop new optical diagnostic systems which combine global laser light sheet droplet flow visualization with quantitative fluorescence and Doppler measurements of fuel spray density and velocity.",

        "abstract": "There is a clear need for an effective method of invariant landmark recognition and place determination in the development of autonomous guidance of robotics vehicle.  Due to the change of perspective of objects viewed from moving vehicle, invariance is a critical requirement in landmark recognition.  Neurobiological research in 80s has found that the receptive fields in primate's visual cortex compensate dynamical changes of retinal images of objects by its own dynamical warping.  This suggests an straightforward and efficient approach to invariant object recognition.  Motivated by the computational strategy of biological vision system, CompuSensor Technology (CST) Corporation has developed a novel method compensates image scale, rotation, and translation variance by a direct affine transform of Gabor basis function controlled by a Lie group processor.  We propose to develop a method of incorporating CST's scheme to an artificial intelligence system for landmark recognition and place determination with invariance regarding to rotation, scale, translation.  The method of using a straightforward geometric compensation controlled by a Lie group processor overcomes shortcomings of current state of the art object recognition methods:  It greatly reduces redundant template storage and matching in terms of views; It avoids the multiple response problem of the Fourier-Mellin transform method.",

        "abstract": "We propose to develop a dual affine transform method and an extended  Kalman filter for extracting target from video images, and locating its three  dimensional (3-D) position in GPS coordinates. Due to the changing  perspective, the appearances of the selected target will be different. Rapid  motion/geometric compensation is essential to target extraction. Also, in order  to estimate camera motion, it is necessary to obtain accurate two dimensional  geometric/kinetic measurement for the background in images. Dual affine  transform method offers an excellent candidate for the sophisticate motion  compensation and image 2-D geometric measurements. Using 3-D rigid motion  and perspective projection models, and with the camera positions established  by GPS and inertial navigator, extended Kalman filter scheme can be employed  to estimate target 3-D position from the 2-D geometric measurements.  Compared with constrained inverse problem formulation currently being used  in computer vision,  the extended Kalman filter has the advantage of  incrementally  improving the accuracyof 3-D position by exploiting high  redundancy of 2-D measurements in the sequence of video images. Phase I  work will develop robust algorithms to meet navy's requirement of accuracy  under operation constraints and show the feasibility of our approach to video  image target extraction and location by demonstrating its performance.",

        "abstract": "Reclaiming mine-infested areas so that they are safe for civilian use (demining) is a subject of considerable interest today.  The State Department estimates that approximately 85 million mines emplaced worldwide cause 150 casualities a week.  Extensive mined areas exist in Asia, Africa, Europe, and numerous other locations.  Current state-of-the-art demining techniques vary in both approach and equipment; however, they generally involve hand tools and mine detectors.  All techniques currently share two traits:  they are manpower intensive and result in considerable risk to the personnel involved.  Improvements in demining are sought which will result in reduced cost and acceptable timelines while achieving near perfect removal/neutralization and operator safety.  Concept Engineering Group, Inc. (CEG) has been developing for the utility industry over the last several years a new digging method that uses supersonic air jets to provide a non-contacting, inherently safe form of excavation.  This safe excavation technology allows precise and controlled digging and is ideally suited to uncovering a buried mine.  Supersonic air jets are extremely effective at penetrating and dislodging most types of soil, but are harmless to buried objects.  Based on its work, CEG proposes to develop a man portable, supersonic air jet, backpack demining system.  Anticipated Benefits:  The man portable, supersonic air jet, backpack demining system will allow safer, more efficient demining operations.  However, since supersonic air jets do not harm nonporous objects, such portable units could be used anywhere it is necessary to uncover objects or dig holes safely.  This includes archaelogical, agricultural, forestry, landscaping, utility, and domestic homeowner uses.",

Therefore, many devices were proposed in the past, and some of them including a recent one with a vaneless cavity by Allied Signal Engines, demonstrated impressive surge margin enhancement. However, there ahs been no detailed investigations on understanding the flow mechanism leading to the improvement of surge margin, or the optimization of cavity location and size, due to a lack of instrumentation capable of measure unsteady localized flows.  Therefore, an innovative flow measurement concept is proposed for systematic research to obtain improved centrifugal compressor surge margin.  The concept consists of a laser velocimeter and high frequency pressure transducers used between feasibility of the measurement concept.  In Phase II this measurement concept will be applied to a small scale compressor, which would lead us to a promising cavity geometry and location.  The most promising cavity (or cavities) will then be tested in a full scale compressor or a gas turbine to demonstrate its (or their) full potential.  The research will be performed in collaboration with Allied Signal Engines throughout Phase I and Phase II of the project",

Explosive D which has been pressed into and removed from projectiles or other ammunitions is much more sensitive than new or unused material.  Therefore, reclaimed material should not be pressed or loaded into ammunition items until it has been recrystallized.  Apart from recrystallization cost, removal from the Projectiles Or ammunition could be risky because of the sensitivity changes due to aging.  Therefore, there is a need to develop a safe and cost effective technology which would convert Explosive D into commercially usable product in an environmentally acceptable manner. Conducting Materials Corp. (CMC) has developed a cost effective microwave technology known as \"Microwave Induced Rotational Excitation Technology\" (MIRET).  This technology can convert high explosives like HMX, RDX, TNT into commercial products.  An attractive attribute of this technology is that it can selectively decompose one high explosive in the presence of other constituents.  Additionally since metal does not absorb microwaves MIRET can be employed to decompose a desired high explosive such as Explosive D, in situ, without it being removed from the projectile or munitions.",

This proposal seeks funding to support development of material   alternatives to YBa2Cu3O7-x (YBCO) which may have more favorable   properties for high temperature superconducting microwave devices,   namely--lower loss, higher power handling, and lower   intermodulation products.  To achieve these improvements it is   necessary to improve both the intragranular and intergranular   properties of YBCO.  We will investigate Ag doped YBa2Cu3O7-x to   address improvements in intergranular properties.  Research of   others has indicated that the grain-to-grain coupling is improved   by the presence of Ag at the grain boundaries.  A process for the   thin film growth of this material will be developed using pulsed   laser ablation and various material characterization techniques.   The microwave properties (Rs,  , power handling) of promising   Ag-doped YBCO films will be characterized using dielectric cavity   and microstrip resonator techniques.  To characterize the   intermodulation characteristics of Ag-doped YBCO, an eight-pole   bandpass filter in the 900 Mhz cellular communications band will be   fabricated from a double-sided Ag-doped YBCO film on a 2\"   substrate.  The performance of this device will be compared to a   similar device made from undoped YBCO.  If Ag-doped YBCO shows   improved performance, it will be immediately integrated into our   production of films for our wireless product group.",

They could also be used as voltage drivers for single flux quantum circuits which are capable of digital operation at 100's of GHz.  Low power dissipation and high temperature superconductor implementation should also make them very suitable for commercial and military satellite based sensing and detection applications.",

Fractures of the lower thoracic and upper lumbar vertebra are identified as the most dominant major type of injury that occurs during the high acceleration catapult stage of ejection.  Similar statistics are observed with respect to helicopter mishaps. Inadequate alignment of the upper torso is the significant cause of lumbar spinal injuries in otherwise successful ejections or helicopter recovery.  A support method is required to provide support and alignment to the lower spinal column during these high impact accelerations. The parameters and functional requirements that establish an optimal support and alignment system will be identified and quantified. A preliminary design and alternative design o    options are provided.  An analytical development procedure will be used to evaluate the preliminary design and design options.  The Phase I program will accomplish a detailed conceptual design. The detailed conceptual design will provide an optimal lumbar support and alignment system as determined by the design Parameters and the analytical development of the system.",

However, some facilities are approaching a critical state of disrepair and represent a substantial facility management burden due to uncontrolled severe deterioration of reinforced concrete in marine environments.  Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center's professionals estimate that the Navy expends in excess of $300 million annually worldwide to repair such damage.  Both the need to preserve the Navy's mission from the perspective of maintaining readiness of marine facilities worldwide and today's legislative and fiscal mood demand effective and efficient management of these facilities.  While well-implemented maintenance management practice is comprised of a broad array of technical and project management competencies; reliable, practical diagnostic nondestructive examination tools for enabling the Navy's facility management staff to rapidly evaluate presence, extent, and severity of ongoing deterioration would certainly advance the Navy's ability to adapt to 21st century infrastructure rehabilitation challenges.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop an improved bucket design that will revolutionize the approach to fire suppression.  Helicopters now use slung buckets to deliver water, retardants and foam to fire sites.  The urgency of time (fire control lines must be established before the fire overruns them) and the need for expensive equipment (helicopters typically cost $20 million and rent for $5,000 per hour) demand that rapid -- and controllable -- technologies be used.  Unfortunately, current bucket technology does not have any means to control the release of material delivered, except by varying the speed and height of the aircraft.  With the smart bucket design proposed herein, the pilot simply selects the coverage level and volume of the material to be deposited.  A system controller then opens the bucket valve on command and varies its position to provide uniform flow rate and deposition.  More strategic use of the bucket contents will then occur.  Instrument inputs for wind speed, ground speed, acceleration and release height will be used to adjust valve position to obtain the desired coverage level under the helicopter and downwind of its flight path.  When installed, this system will reduce operational costs, increase pilot safety, and save millions of dollars in resources (life and property) by putting down reliable fire control lines and/or extinguish the fire more quickly.",

Special techniques to reduce wall pressure and shear fluctuations may involve either laminarization, of the boundary layer (through body shaping or distributed, auction)' or       I  control of structures in the transitional or turbulent boundary layer (through injection of polymer, water, or gas) .       The effectiveness of these different approaches over a range of frequencies and Reynolds numbers shall be demonstrated, using a prediction- methodology which has been validated with- experimental data (with and without application of boundary layer control techniques) from both the United States and the for Soviet Union. Approaches shall   I  be evaluated in terms of level of reduction of wall fluctuations, required volumes of onboard material, power requirements, and difficulty of practical application.",

In Phase I, we will perform research and design the overall framework and essential software components of the system, and identify future research and feasibility issues for Phase II. Existing tools for terrain database generation are either too slow, too inflexible or too unreliable to be practical for many applications. We propose to design a flexible system that can quickly and reliably generate a complete, simulation-ready database using terrain imagery with a variety of ancillary inputs including digital elevation data, camera calibration parameters, ground truths, and user-identified feature correspondences. The main features of the proposed system are: 1. Unified framework for terrain reconstruction and image registration. 2. Terrain mesh optimization for real-time scene generation. 3. Texture map compositing from multiple images. The first feature will be the primary focus of our research and development. We propose to devise an extensible framework based on current research for the fusion of photogrammetry and computer vision techniques (e.g., stereo correspondence, shape-from-shading, camera calibration) for terrain image registration and reconstruction.",

        "abstract": "Excessive seeker jitter caused by high frequency bending vibration severely reduces the interception capabilities of kinetic kill vehicles (KKVs). Previous studies of vibration suppression techniques have indicated that tuned-mass dampers (TMDs) are the most effective method of reducing seeker jitter. CSA Engineering, Inc., and Garman Systems, Inc., propose the development of an innovative solid-state TMD for KKVs. The innovation is the use of shunted piezoceramic materials as the TMD loss mechanism. In contrast to viscous, viscoelastic, and elastomeric loss mechanisms, shunted piezoceramics have low temperature sensitivity and are capable of withstanding the high-g loads experienced by the KKV.  The proposed TMD concept is a bi-directional device that minimizes parasitic weight and size by using only one proof mass to suppress motion in two orthogonal directions. Shunted piezoceramics tuned to the first bending mode of the vehicle provide the TMD loss mechanism that reduces seeker jitter. In the Phase I research, the  size, weight, and performance tradeoffs of two TMD concepts will be studied. A rudimentary prototype of one concept will be built and tested to demonstrate the feasibility of piezoceramic TMDs for kinetic kill vehicles.",

        "abstract": "The proposed research will assess the feasibility of designing efficient and reconfigurable processors for actuator-sensor arrays. The arays considered in this proposal are highly distributed networks of sensors and actuators and a processing interface that controls and monitors the array.  The advent of MEMS and related microfabrication technologies have enabled the development of actuator-sensor arrays for structural control.  The practicality of actuator-sensor arrays has made reconfigurability and efficient information processing central design issues. The proposed innovation is to increase efficiency by locally processing the large number of sensor and actuator signals before sending them to a central processor.  Local processign increases the speed at which information can be exchanged and allows local measurements to be spatial filtered.  The speed and accuracy of the local processing will be maximized by constructing the processor form digitally programmable analog electronics or programmable logic devices.  Technical challenges include determining the seensor and actuator genre for the array, developing control algorithms that exploit sensor-actuator distribution, and identifuing the most efficient architecture for the local processor.

The inverter design will utilize  Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBT), as the switching device of choice,  controlled by a microprocessor based control unit.  This proposal will discuss the  technical issues involved in the design and development of the PMM, the starting  circuitry, the inverter system, and the control unit.  Thermal and installation  issues will be presented to determine performance and reliability characteristics.

This algorithm provides orders of magnitude improvement over all conventional neural network paradigms in the areas of response recall accuracy, information storage capacity and density, immunity to noise, generalization characteristics, and effective rates of processing. There is no practical limit to the number or complexity of Stimulus-Response patterns which may be enfolded onto a single correlation matrix. Response error during training rapidly converges to zero with few iterations required to attain near perfect recall. Nonlinearity within pattern associations is not a limiting factor. Stimulus patterns are transformed in parallel fashion through all patterns previously encoded into the matrix. Response values provide not only the desired information but also a measure of confidence in that information. Pattern recognition performance and speed far superior to that of the fastest supercomputer doing linear search may be achieved with ordinary personal computers using OAM.",

As a result, there is a need for electrical hull penetrators/connectors which can transfer high currents or high voltages through the submarine's pressure hull. We propose to review the capabilities and limitations of existing penetrator/ connector designs and explore new design  approaches for both high current and high voltage applications. Our research will  include the following considerations: - Materials -  Failure mechanisms - Penetrator size constraints -  Primary and secondary sealing methods - Conductor sizes in both mated and unmated conditions During Phase I, we will define a matrix of connectors based on power requirements and operational criteria.  This matrix will define a family of hull penetrators based on conductor sizes for different levels of voltages and currents. We will build upon our expertise gained over the past three decades in designing and building highly successful electrical hull penetrators/connectors for submarines in pursuing new and innovative concepts for meeting high current and high voltage requirements.",

        "abstract": "A novel approach to the propulsion of very small, micro air vehicles is proposed in which electrostatic forces acting between an ion gas cloud and an appropriate anode are harnessed for thrust or lift.  A means is proposed for the generation and maintenance of the ion gas from ambient air and for the regulation of the propulsor.  Preliminary study indicates the new concept is valid  only for air vehicles weighing a few grams or less operating at very low Reynolds numbers.  Analysis shows that the proposed propulsor when applied appropriately can be many times more efficient than similarly-sized actuator disk propulsor like propellers or jets on such miniature air vehicles. Moreover, the design is simple, robust, reliable, and has exceptionally wide flight envelope.  In this Phase I effort mathematical modeling and basic experimentation will be done to validate the concept.  In addition, preliminary studies will be made of its manufacturability and its mission-effectiveness.  In Phase II, working propulsor(s) will be designed, manufactured and tested.",

        "abstract": "The Process-Efficient Motor (PEM, also known as Inside-Out Motor, IOM) approach to manufacture of solid rocket propellants offers the potential of greatly reduced propellant manufacture and storage, and novel methods of ballistic control.  The basic approach involves the use of corrugated hydrophilic film, initially as a mandrel for filament winding of a high performance composite case, followed by infusion of an oxidizer.  Unfortunately, current film materials have significant shortcomings.  Most conventional adhesives are incompatible with the oxidizer, which must subsequently be infused, and water-based adhesives (including aqueous PVA) have been found to have many disadvantages.  In addition, the film loses most of its mechanical properties when swollen.  This program is intended to demonstrate the effective use of radiation (e.g. photons, high energy electrons, and/or ultraviolet) to overcome some of these problems in a clean, dry manner that is adaptable to a continuous production processes.|  Benefits:  For commercial purposes, this project will lead to the development of a new lower cost rocket motor for military and commercial applications.|",

These systems and the environment in which they are immersed bring new kinds of complexities that require new methods to analyze.  Traditional tactics do not address the issues involved with multiple bistatic sources and receivers.  The environment can no longer be idealized as a homogeneous isotropic medium.  Sound speed profiles vary dramatically across space, creating transmission loss functions which vary as we move from point to point as well as radially.  This level of complexity causes human intuition to function poorly, unless supported by well-designed information displays. These problems are all the more significant in the light of the kinds of military conflict we are liable to encounter in today's world.  Regional conflicts with potential adversaries will tend to occur in shallow waters where there is a great deal of inhomogeneity and where background noise is dominated by reverberation.

Our Phase I approach is to quantify the bandwidth limitations of the communications system, then identify the optimal Kalman filter motion and observation models to use, based on the bandwidth limitations.  We will develop a test version of the Kalman filter software, and demonstrate by tests conducted in the Wagner Data Fusion Testbed and by technical documentation that the resulting filter achieves a significant reduction in the communications requirements of the Situational Awareness system, without loss of information.",

A  tailored, distributed communications network model will be designed and  developed based on known operational and environmental constraints  inherent to the mission of a submarine to assess current and alternative  systems to improve data throughput.  We will replicate the current submarine  communications framework to provide a benchmark system, identifying  communications systems bottlenecks and limitations to throughput.  By  iterating the parametric data structures of the model (e.g., antenna loss, bit  error rates, propagation delays, and link protocols), we are able to conduct a  systems-wide technical modeling, simulation and performance analysis of the  submarine communications network.  From this baseline, system parameters  will be adjusted to optimize channel utilization and maximize data throughput  while maintaining data integrity.  By leveraging commercial, leading edge  advances in antenna design, advanced modulation and coding (source and  channel) schemes and lossless data compression techniques, alternative  communications data links and technologies that have wide commercial  application and availability will be overlaid on the model structure to identify  those approaches that have multi-path application and offer the greatest  potential for throughput improvements.",

        "abstract": "US Army planners emphasize implementation of a total protection umbrella for soldiers in any future tactical scenarios by providing them with full communication and EW capability to effectively defeat a variety of threats, such as smart munitions and artillery fuzes.  A digitized battlefield information is hence provided to the information processing centers to plan a coordinated tactical solutions.  Secure communication requirements and small size of a phase array antenna requires a Comm on the Move at millimeter wave frequencies.  Distribution of modulated carrier and control signals is very challenging at MMW and hence photonics is proposed as a viable technique to alleviate the problems associated with loss, interference, size and weight of copper based transmission networks.  A system architecture pursued by US Army CECOM is based on the generation of stabilized carrier signal using heterodyning of two phase locked laser sources.  The frequency stability of the generated carrier signal and efficient modulation and demodulation of the data signals are among system critical issues.  Analytical modeling of close-in to carrier phase noise of the generated MMW frequency reference using heterodyning of OPLL and OILPLL are the goal of Phase I.  The novel OILPLL is designed to improve the close-in to carrier phase noise of the standard OPLL.",

In order to  improve the acoustic performance and resolution of present systems, there is great motivation to  develop multi-line towed acoustic arrays that can be towed from the same platforms that are  presently used to tow the single-line arrays.  Compliant force devices can develop the forces  necessary to spread multi-line towed arrays.  There are two crucial components to a successful compliant foil towed army system.  The first  component consists of the compliant foils, which provide sufficient force to spread the multi-line  array.  The second component is the passive feedback system that provides proper dynamic  stability of the entire towed system.  Both components must be designed to interact compatibly  with each other, and offer robust and reliable performance over the entire operational envelope of  the towed array.  This proposal addresses the research and development associated with the concept evolution of a  passive feedback device to be used for the stabilization of compliant foil multi-line towed arrays.",

THe high speed will allow data to capture changes in the shape of the human face while talking, running, etc.  Finite eleemnt analysis (FEA) will be used to evaluate the adjoining surfaces of face and mask by evaluating boundary conditions.  Human factors engineering will be used to build a model of discomfort factors based on the pressures, skin deflections, and location of pressure points, as well as contributing to the anthropometric and biological tissue considerations that will interact with the laser scans and finite element analyses.

Decision Technology Network (DTN), Inc. proposes: (1) to further develop WorkWORLK as an individual counseling and decision-making tool based on current policies; (2) to continually update it; and (3) to offer it on-line.  Offering the software on-line (rather than as a stand-alone desk-top application) will keep the software at a central location so that frequently changing policies and regulations can be more easily incorporated.  Customers, therefore, will be assured of receiving accurate results.  WorkWORLD On-line (WOL) will allow users to access the program through the World Wide Web.  Users will be able to input data about an individual's current benefit situation, and then ask \"what-if\" questions such as, \"What will happen to the person's food stamps, housing supplement, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and net spendable income if he/she $850 per month?  $1,200 per month?  $1,800 per month?  What will happen if he/she marries someone who receives SSI?\"  Hyperlinks will allow the user to find explanations for the results.  DTN will test the technical feasibility by developing WOL for use in Virginia.  During Phase II, other states will be added.",

        "abstract": "This effort builds on initial feasiblity analysis and measurements   taken to support concealed weapon detection.  DSA proposes a nine   month program consisting of two (2) items.  Item 1 (6 months - 5   tasks) conducts CWD analysis, measurements, evaluation, system   design and ends with the delivery of a draft Final Technical   Report (Task 5).  Item 2 (3 months - 1 task #6) refines and   elaborates the information in the DRAFT FTR resulting in a   comprehensive FTR covering the total period of performance (9   months - Items 1 and 2).  Power level for the active radar   transmissions are extremely low and will meet current established   health/safety standards.  Four related concepts (real aperture,   tomographic, SAR and ISAR) are proposed for CWD.  These concepts   are designed to satisfy potential requirements of the military and   law enforcement community while providing the implementation   flexibility and extended range.  Open (uncontrolled) and closed   (some control) implementations of sensors are planned to   accommodate various environments and user missions/scenarios.   Tasks planned are:  support CWD study and analysis, algorithm   development, wideband radar measurements of weapons and background   scenes and a CWD performance evaluation.  Based on the results of   the analysis, measurements and performance evaluations, a design   concept for each of the four implementations would be performed to   define sensor configurations which produce quality images at an   affordable price.  Within the item 1 investigations, DSA will   determine feasibility of using select implementations for   through-the-wall sensing.  Results would be included in both the   item 1 and 2 reporting.",

        "abstract": "We proposed to develop enabling technology for the digital control engine fuel (turbine, diesel, etc.) by using a large array of very fast acting, micro-miniature (MEMS technology), fluid, tab-actuated, vortex valves.  Such valving technology would, for the first time permit active control/modulation and digital waveform synthesis of engine liquid fuel flow, with specific application to the active control of combustor instabilities in military and commercial gas turbines.  Most conventional macro-size valves are not sufficiently responsive, and those that are, are very expensive due to the need for close tolerances and exotic materials, and have poor reliability due to the mechanical complexity.  DRT's MEMs valves, operated by a simple, unloaded, vortex-tripping tab, are based on a macro-sized version demonstrated, in high speed mud pulse telemetry systems, and can modulate flow by more that 3:1.  MEMs tab motion would be achieved by using a on-chip electro=static comb actuators, and possible, when they are developed, NASA Thunder, low voltage, piezo-electric benders.  These benders will demonstrate the capability to design and manufacture micro-miniature vortex valves with a flow modulation capacity of 10 percent of a typical engines fuel flow.  By etching arrays of valves in silicon with and without projecting tabs the limits of modulation will be established.  Testing with water and kerosene will validate CFD projections which will have been performed to analyze the low Reynolds number vortex flow fields.  Analysis of the actuation system to be designed in Phase II will also be conducted.",

Presently, no one method exists to adequately assess the coastal environment.  Large database containing environmental information are available, but do not provide current conditions. Near-real-time information from battlefield sensors is often \"spotty\" dependent on deployment opportunity, area of coverage and proper interpretation.  Computer models often can fill data gaps, but model execution and interpretation are usually performed by \"experts,\" far from the battle front.  These shortcomings results in an inefficient, fragmented approach to a complex problem that often needs to be solved in near real-time data.  The solution is t o integrate available computer models, historical databases, and real-time data into a user-friendly system that will provide the best possible information in the shortest period of time.  The challenge is to create a workable exchange between numerical models and geoprocessing.  Our approach is to research and develop a systems capable of combining historical, near-real-time, and modeled data into one environment for forecast modeling.  The interfacing of databases and models with the GIS is a principal consideration that will be addressed.",

A problem common with these systems is their lack of reliability when subjected to intense radiation.  For example, it is common for thermocouples to prematurely fail under neutron irradiation, and it has been shown that diagnostic coils and sensors which are currently in use in fusion systems will be unacceptable in the next generation fusion power plants.  This lack of reliability is caused by an irradiation induced degradation in the insulating material used in these components.  Specifically, neutron and gamma irradiation can cause both an immediate, transient degradation as well as a permanent degradation in the resistive capability of insulating material. This project will examine the permanent degradation in the insulating capability of mineral insulated diagnostic probes used in fusion systems in order to understand the conduction mechanisms of mineral insulated probes subjected to neutron irradiation environments.  For several combinations of materials and processing parameters, the radiation induced electrical degradation (RIED) will be quantitatively measured.  The most radiation resistant combinations will be carried into Phase II.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  The mechanisms responsible for the degradation in mineral insulated cables should be understood, and concrete radiation hardened diagnostic probes, to be used in fusion systems such as ITER, will be identified.",

However, the fluorescence techniques used to get the qualitative and quantitative chemical information do not have the ability to detect such nonfluorescent materials as chlorinated hydrocarbons.  This project will develop a sensor, based on characteristics of laser light scattered from material surfaces, called Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS), to detect these contaminants.  SERS is sensitive only to the layer of contaminants in close proximity to the sensor.  The quantity and type of molecules at the sensor is controlled through the use of very specific affinity coatings.  This feature, in combination with SERS fluorescence quenching, avoids potential interference from humic or other fluorescence materials.  SERS can be performed with a low power diode laser, whereas fluorescence requires a tunable or pulsed source.  The near-infrared excitation and the Raman scattered light can be efficiently transmitted to and from the cone head sensor with conventional fiber optics.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee: Direct commercial applications are expected in the area of ground contamination mapping using cone penetrometers.

Use of the metal binder reduces the thermal stability of the compacts.  This limits the applications for the PCDs.  The hardness and toughness of binderless Polycrystalline Diamond material is equivalent to those of naturally formed polycrystalline diamond - \"carbonado\".  The result of this program will be development of an economical U.S. based manufacturing capability of superior machining and drilling tools.

In addition to wirelessness, the headset must be unobtrusive  and deliver a high quality image.  We propose a research methodology and  development program that will result in a wireless, low mass, high  definition, wide FOV full color personal display that is worn like a  pair of eyeglasses.  Diffraction's novel display incorporates user  adjustable opaqueness for undistorted look-through capability for view  augmentation or replacement.  The headset transceiver will support  virtual audio reception as well as transmission of position data.  The proposed research effort contains an analysis of bandwidth  requirements for a two channel eye worn display including an  investigation of data compression and bit rate reduction techniques for  efficient delivery of this information with a review and selection of  suitable wideband wireless technology (lightwave or radio).  Other novel  concepts proposed include host based image encoding used in conjunction  with a user worn processor for on-head data decoding, and the  development of a unique next generation wireless VR display with minimal  weight, low power consumption, 1600 line resolution, variable look-  through and eye tracking capability.",

Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CdZnTe), a high-Z, room temperature detector material, will be used in a configuration that provides submillimeter intrinsic spatial resolution.  Phase I will demonstrate feasibility by showing that a high density CdZnTe array and an associated microelectronics readout package can be operated in tandem to perform imaging functions.

The first stage has been completed in our subcontractor's lab (at NJIT), and the second stage has been started.  This innovative technical approach includes a design for confining a low-mass termocouple junction at the at the tip region only of the probe.  \n\nThe main advantage of this innovative approach is that the microprobe will be able to serve the dual function of an AFM probe for surface imaging, and a thermal microprobe for probing the temperature of very small regions of the sample surface with high resolution.  This project is expected to result in a device for measuring surface temperature, with temperature and spatial resolution unobtainable by other means.",

Problems of particular difficulty are the separation of mixed vibratory signals which may overlap in both the time and frequency domains and fault signature identification.  The proposed work recommends development of a digital signal processing scheme for fault detection and signature identification using cepstral decomposition of response signals.  It is also proposed to develop a scheme for source point identification in a multi-source environment using a neural network technique.  The work tasks include coding of the signal processing algorithm and feasibility demonstrations using simulated data.  Simplified proof-of-concept experiments area also planned.",

Emphasis is placed on tradeoffs between algorithm efficiency  and performance.  The littoral acoustic environment is characterized by near  and far field targets and dense dynamic near and far field directional  interference at many ranges and levels of stationarity.  Unique applications of  Sub-Aperture Spatial Processing and Parabolic Near Field Wave Front  Approximation techniques are proposed as efficient techniques to reduce  target suppression caused by a mismatch between the Adaptive Beamforming  constraints and the near field acoustic wave front and sensor array shape  estimates.  A third technique uses Synthetic (array data) Covariance Estimates  made from conventional beam spatial spectra for adaptive beamforming  weights computation to provide a fast low throughput weight updating  technique in dynamic signal fields.  The fourth technique provides an  innovative approach for passive target range estimation by using Near Field  Adaptive Beamforming Focused Range Zones.  Theoretic performance  calculations will be made based on  spatial covariance data models that will  incorporate wave front and array shape uncertainties and dynamic source  geometries.  When possible limited amounts of real data will be used.  Signal  processing  gains and processing resource requirements will be tabulated  with the most promising techniques selected for an extensive real data  evaluation in Phase 2.",

It has been known for decades   that optics has the potential to surpass electronics in certain   areas but its use has been limited due to inadequate electro-optic   technologies.  The optical joint transform correlator (JTC) is   among the important architectures being investigated for use in   high speed image processing.  A problem with the JTC is the fact   that its output is frequently dominated by the unwanted presence of   strong autocorrelation signals which can mask the desired   cross-correlation.  Recently a modification of the JTC architecture   has been developed which supresses the unwantged autocorrelation   terms.  A novel optically addressed spatial light modulator is   needed to take advantage of this new approach.  Displaytech has been developing ferroelectric liquid crystal   (FLC)-VLSI spatial light modulators (SLMS) similar to the one   required for the JTC.  We propose to develop and compare candidate   FLC-VLSI designs which perform the required JTC function, and then   to fabricate a small scale prototype.  In Phase II we aim to scale   up the SLM to 256x256 pixels.",

Phase I research will identify a system design for smart high strength bolts, and will select the structural and health monitoring components as well as the inspection scheme for this system in order to satisfy the structural, health monitoring and processing requirements compatible with the existing MS 21250 specification.  The alternative system design to be considered include:  (1) a monolithic smart/structural system; (2) tagging smart particles dispersed into a structural host matrix; (3) smart fibers inserted into a structural host matrix; and (4) structural material with a smart coating.  Some key smart materials to be investigated for incorporation into these system designs include: shape memory, electrostrictive, piezoelectric, magnetostrictive, electroresistive, and fiber optic materials.  Steel as well as metal matrix composites are examples of structural materials for the smart bolt system.  Both passive and active health monitoring schemes will be considered.  Phase I research comprises the following tasks:  (1) survey the available smart technologies and assess their applicability to different system designs for active or passive health monitoring; (2) select the best system design and its structural and health monitoring components; (3) identify signal detection and interpretations schemes for health monitoring; (4) determine the economic viability of the selected smart bolt systems; and (5) prepare the final report.  Phase II research would physically manufacture and verify the smart bolt system, would refine and finalize the design and deliver a level III drawing package.",

        "abstract": "The ultimate goal of the proposed project is the development of a novel drug delivery system which is cable of providing long-lasting pain relief with superior release profiles (using both polar and nonpolar anesthetic/analgesic drugs while reducing the debilitating side effects, such as loss of motor function or sensation.  The proposed system is anticipated to improve the therapy and care of patients suffering from pain by providing a steady effect over a long period of time while reducing the potential side effects.  This project will focus on the development and characterization of modified polymers that can be utilized in a conceptually novel drug delivery design configuration for controlled release.  The proposed novel drug delivery design virtually eliminates all drug-polymer interactions making the proposed drug delivery platform suitable for application to a variety of chemical compounds.  This design configuration relies on the development, fabrication, and characterization of biodegradable microporous membranes.  The microporous membranes will be manufactured by incorporation of suitable pore forming agents within the polymeric matrices.  These pore forming agents will be identified during the first part of this project. Subsequently , the mechanical and transport properties of the manufactured membranes will be characterized in order to evaluate the technical feasibility of the proposed modified polymeric materials and their subsequent use in the proposed design configuration is expected to have a substantial impact in the field.",

        "abstract": "Development of software systems is one of the largest and most important sectors of the U.S. economy and one where the U.S. retains a substantial competitive advantage. Application interface work constitutes a large fraction of the $ billions spent annually by government agencies, contractors and private developers.  Graphical interface builders aim to reduce this effort substantially while improving the quality of the resulting interfaces.  They should support large systems built using multiple languages and running concurrently on heterogeneous networks.  Inter- face prototypes should lead smoothly into fully functional, customizable applications.  Builders must provide suitable abstractions for window systems, application interfaces and event handling in order to provide the requisite portability and flexibility.  No system to date has attempted this kind of flexibility in the complex environments found for large software systems. Our approach is termed the Composable Interactor Framework (CIF) and is based on the dual notions of general, abstract interactor elements and a customizable and combinable object framework.  CIFs combine the portability and abstraction of User Interface Management Systems with the application-customizable interface and element combinability of systems lacking strict separation of presentation and application.",

The Rotary-Piston combusiton-ignition engine design uses six double-ended pistons have centrally located drive pins reciprocating the pistons twice per revolution, providing the equivalent of a 12-cylinder 4-stroke having a mere seven moving parts and delivering power-to-weight ratios exceeding 1:1.

The proposed Phase I research effort will perform preliminary design and provide proof of concept through the development of a test-stand prototype to evaluate drive unit performance and VSCF integration. results will be compared with state-of-the-art genset capability and estimated cost of production to determine the significance of the innovation.",

        "abstract": "We propose to enhance a previously designed and built processor interconnection network to make a distributed multiprocessor system that both has higher performance and is substantially more fault tolerant.  The philosophy is to provide a system with: rapid, reliable global detection of system status changes with negligible impact on the host processors; in particular, no host message processing during steady state operation.  Standard PCI interfaces so heterogeneous processors are supported minimal impact on system performance, which means simple added logic, primarily in hardware, and small bandwidth penalty.  Competitive price and performance with 1 Gb/s links, flexible levels of status monitoring and fault recovery.  The techniques used are: geographically distributed, functionally-interchangeable processing elements that are richly and redundantly interconnected.  Optical data links to extend component separation and link bandwidth, hardware detection of several failure scenarios, ranging from application software paralysis to power failure, resulting in rapid optical bypass of the affected component.  Hardware monitoring with system global software notification only with status changes, so host processor cycles expended only if absolutely necessary.  Parallel, transparent processing at each interconnect node of a special status packet to update local status and transmit global status.",

The positioning, guidance, and control are derived from GPS, and remote control techniques developed for pilotless vehicles. -       The launch, additional erection/adaptability features, and recovery are based upon deployable antenna techniques. -       The seaworthiness at high speeds is augmented by low cost multi-hull concepts supported by research at the Florida Institute of Technology (Florida Tech). -       Target reflectivity background aided by stealth technology studies. The Phase I system design will include the platform and the operator control subsystems.  The Phase I Option will include full scale model testing and reporting. Phase I will be reviewed with the customer and documented such that the Phase II effort will be a low risk design finalization.

The foundation of the program is an existing 3-D program that has been developed under prior SBIR funding for retreating-blade dynamic stall on modern high-performance helicopter rotors.  The program will be improved in four significant ways.  First, capability for dynamic adaptive grid generation will be incorporated in the program. Second, an optimum second-order closure model will be selected for inclusion in the program.  Third, a rational method will be devised to predict the onset of transition to turbulence, including initial conditions for a turbulence-model computation through transition and into the turbulent regime.  The revised code will bed exercised (using its currently implemented two-equation turbulence model) for a two-dimensional geometry for both deep- and light-stall conditions.  Fourth, advances in the solution algorithm will be incorporated, including nonlinear multigrid, TVD, higher-order advective differencing, and true periodicity across the c-c grid.  The  Phase II code will include the new transition/turbulence models and will be exercised for three-dimensional problems.",

One rationale for this research is that such understanding will assist efforts to improve the toxicity of crystal proteins through protein engineering.\n\nProtein engineering efforts have been aided by two important findings on the mechanism of toxicity of crystal proteins.  Briefly stated these findings are 1) Bacillus thuringiensis crystal proteins bind to cells lining the insect midgut; 2) Bound proteins form pores causing colloid osmotic lysis of the insect gut cells.

The fungus attacks all of the above ground portions of the plants, but foliar and floral blights are the primary causes of economic loss, especially for roses used in cut flower production.  Currently registered chemical fungcides used to control this disease are relatively ineffective due to resistance developed by Botrytis against the chemicals.  Additionally, the heavy use of chemical pesticides causes health concerns to applicators, greenhouse workers and the consumer public which purchases the flowers.  The proposed Phase I research would evaluate the use of multiple microbial pest control agents (MPCAs) to combat this disease.

Current demilitarization techniques include open detonation and traditional washout methods or meltout.  Open detonation includes uncontrolled air emissions, and is unpopular with the general public; traditional washout or meltout methods may require contact with the explosives, causing contamination and reducing the likelihood of recycle and reuse. Microwave meltout technology has the advantage of rapid removal of high explosive from munition items, with no contamination of the explosive, making it suitable for reuse or recovery.  The developed technology for microwave removal of high explosives from loaded munitions is attractive to both the and government contractors because of potential for reduced cycle times, reduced energy requirements, reduced operating costs and equipment investment, and higher value end product. El Dorado Engineering employees pioneered the original investigations of microwave meltout of explosives for the Army, and conduced actual testing. Much of what was learned about the basic science of microwave heating of explosives will be directly applied to this project.",

In Phase I we will develop prototype windows, perform tests to demonstrate their ability to withstand 1 atmosphere of pressure and determine their E Beam transmission characteristics.  For the E Beam source, we will scale the tube from one used in an EBDS system utilizing a 35 inch duct (two E Beam sources at 300 KV and 90KW of output power) to one that would be suitable for an 8 inch duct (with twin E Beam sources) or a single 4 inch duct.  We will model the mechanical and electrical characteristics for a tube operating at a nominal 100 KV at 5 and 10 KW of output power.  Our theoretical analysis (utilizing existing diode theory i conjunction with computer simulation) between cost and scaling will pay particular attention to long life operation, low cost and small size, which are the necessary system characteristics for both Government and Commercial acceptance.",

The effort conducts research and trade studies to examine an integrated augmenter system design that provides separable targets and realistic signature characteristics including glint, depolarization, fade, scintillation, phase reversals, and jet engine and propeller modulations.  The effort examines aerodynamic drag and stability issues, decoy deployment and staging, target programmability and control, automatic programming modes, remote programming and control, and support issues.

        "abstract": "The proposed program addresses the exploratory development of an advanced electrochemical machining (ECM) technology which relies for its high performance upon the employment of dispersed microparticles in aqueous electrolytes. The approach will utilize suspended particles of C, Ti, Ag, or zeolite Y incorporating Ag or Ti, in aqueous solution containing the respective supporting electrolytes NaF, NaCl, NaBr, NaClO3, NaBrO3, and NaNO3. These electrolyte mixtures will be used in the ECM of titanium and titanium alloy materials employed in air breathing gas turbine propulsion units. Enhanced ECM performance will result because suspended particles will function as microelectrodes in an applied electric field, while exhibiting microscopic electrical discharge phenomena. This will result in favorably perturbing the local ionic and chemical environments in the presence of microparticles compared to the surrounding medium. The presence of suspended electronically conductive microparticles in the electrolyte is anticipated to mitigate catastrophic spar- king, Joule heating, cathode polarization, and anode shape changes due to these effects. Additionally, it is expected that electrochemically machined surface tolerances will be on the scale of microparticles. The approach is not expected to require significant modification of hardware used with current aqueous electrolyte based electrochemical machining technologies.",

Because the limited range of fire extinguish systems, fire fighting always contains an element of danger and is extremely dangerous when the fire occurs in an ammunition storage area.  If the risks of fighting fires in ammunition storage areas are to be reduced to acceptably low levels, a radically new type of fire extinguishing system is needed.  This novel fire extinguishing system could take the form of a launcher and projectiles filled with a fire extinguishing chemical. Alternatively it could be a system that was the portable equivalent of a sprinkler system:  containers filled with a fire extinguishing chemical and equipped with a heat sensing element and placed throughout the ammunition storage area.  For either of these approaches to be practical, however, a new, far more effective, fire extinguishing chemical is needed.  In this proposal a plan is given for developing such a fire extinguishing chemical.  This new chemical has the potential for being far more effective than presently available fire extinguishing chemicals.  It will be quite inexpensive,, as clean as in the use as the halons, completely nontoxic and not damaging to the ozone layer or other aspects of the environment.",

Reduction of carbonate fuel cell cost is desired to further stimulate market interest.  In current carbonate fuel cell matrix manufacturing, the ceramic material, typically lithium aluminate, is dispersed in a solvent to which organic binders and plasticizers are later added to form a bindered ceramic slurry.  The slurry is subsequently formed into thin sheet layers in a tape casting machine, where the solvents are evaporated by applying dry air and/or heat.  The organic solvent is incinerated or condensed and collected for recycling. This project will develop technology to replace the solvents by a less costly, aqueous solvent substitute.  Phase I will identify an aqueous binder system, compatible for use in the carbonate fuel cell, and develop a slurry manufacturing method.  Lab-size tapes from these slurries will be cast and evaluated.  Finally, a laboratory-size single cell will be constructed and operated.  The manufacturing process will be scaled-up and optimized, enabling full area stack test evaluation during Phase II.\n\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  This process should facilitate commercialization of the carbonate fuel cell power plant for applications such as dispersed and baseload utility power generation, as well as for cogeneration applications.  The technology could also be easily applied to other applications such as computer chip fabrication which utilizes similar ceramic tape casting manufacturing processes.",

This project investigates a low-cost concept for fabricating higher strength RTM composites enabling their use in primary aircraft structures.  The approach uses discrete fiber reinforcements positioned transverse to fabric or through a stiffener-skin interface.  Novel fabrication methodology is proposed that achieves 3-D architecture without weaving or stitching.  The methodology is fundamentally low-cost and is scaleable to large preform articles and roll-to-roll products.  Phase I will develop the z-fiber implantation process for RTM preforms and fabricate a matrix of planar RTM composite parts for mechanical testing in-house.  Selected articles will be tested by  a major airframer possessing a database of materials properties for comparison.  The results of testing and analysis will be used to determine the achievable strengths vs fiber configuration.  The suitability of the concept for primary aircraft structures will be assessed.  Other potential benefits of transverse fibers to functions such as thermal management or lightning strike protection will be assessed.  Phase II would further develop the methodology and scale up to the fabrication of prototype components such as a skin with integral stiffeners.

        "abstract": "The extreme environment of a rocket nozzle has high velocity hot combustion products that will erode an uncooled throat area.  When the nozzle temperature is high, physical and chemical processes will erode even the most refractory materials such as tungsten, carbon and carbide ceramics.  Modern hybrid rockets pose especially challenging problems because of higher combustion temperatures and potential mixing instabilities.  Because such erosion degrades rocket performance significantly, there is high payoff in developing non-eroding materials concepts for use in both tactical and launch vehicle rocket motors.    Cooling is a known effective means of eliminating nozzle erosion in liquid propulsion rockets, but the traditional implementation of cooling is complex and impractical for other rockets.  This project investigates a simple configuration for a cooled composite nozzle in which transpiration cooling arises from the volatilization of phase-change materials (PCMs) that saturate a porous structural matrix.  The proposed matrix is a novel non-woven refractory fiber structure that allows control of porosity, strength, conductivity and capillary retention.  The proposed concept is expected to outperform phenolic ablators because there are numerous PCMs condidates that can provide adequate cooling when the vapors transpire at the surface and the structural matrix is far more resistant to erosion than the char arising from ablators.   Phase 1 will evaluate a series of composite materials with different matrix material configurations and different PCMs including a metal and a salt.  Small nozzles will be tested in a laboratory hybrid rocket configuration for burn times lasting tens of seconds.  Modeling will address PCM vapor flow and thermal penetration in the nozzle throat area.  The benefits for specific rocket motor applications will be assessed.",

The primary goal is to provide a very lightweight system, with cold start capability and good performance, that is suitable for Unmanned Air Vehicle heavy fuel engines. Preliminary experimental testing of one concept has indicated that the proposed new atomizing technique is viable.  The concept was used to start, at 0o F and hot run, a light frame, heavy fuel engine. The research program will involve investigation of various combinations of high pressure injection and atomizing approaches; to establish the best method to operate conventional piston engines and Migrating Combustion Chamber (MCC) engines. The program starting point will be the previous experimental work and search of the latest literature.  An analytical model will be developed, and some prototype testing of selected approaches will be performed.  The research will compare performance based on achieving very small Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) particle size required for quick gasification and rapid combustion. In addition, system weight, size, complexity and overall operating performance will be evaluated to establish the best approach for a Phase II development, fabrication and demonstration program.",

The anticipated Phase I results include the following:  (i) the development of more accurate E, P, V equations of state for unreacted explosives than exist now, whose range of validity would extend from the high-pressure range (hundreds of kilobars) down to the 1 bar region, which is needed to describe explosive voids collapsing under shock loading; (ii) the development of thermodynamically compatible T, P, V equations of state of unreacted explosives, which satisfy the experimental temperature variation with volume along the 1 bar line and which are needed in the development of temperature-dependent models of the reaction process.  Two different forms for the E, P, V equation of stat will be considered:  one of the Mie-Gruneisen type; the second based on a variational principle.  It is expected that these equations of state will be used in codes that model the initiation, explosion, and/or detonation of explosives and propellants by impacting fragments, blast waves, penetrators, and shaped charge jets, and the transition from slow/fast cookoff to detonation.",

A wafer is   cleaned many times during its fabrication process to remove a   variety of organic materials, such as photo resists, and inorganic   particles, such as tool/process generated particles.  Hazardous, volatile organic solvents are now used to clean   chemically sensitive wafers.  As restrictions on the use of   hazardous solvents increase, an alternative safe-solvent cleaning   technique is needed of comparable performance.  ESI proposes to examine a three-step (wash-rinse-dry) process   which will meet these requirements.  In this process:  a.  the wafer first immersed in a safe, nonvolatile solvating   agent to remove organic films, b.  the wafer is then rinsed with   a safe, volatile rinse liquid to remove particles and residual   solvating agent, c.  the vapor is then dried with recovery of   the evaporated rinse liquid.  The candidate liquids will be chosen on the basis of their   solvation parameters, as well as the following criteria:  a.  not classified as a VOC, HAP, ODC, or long term global warming   agent b.  be nontoxic c,  not be a flammable liquid (Flash Point   > 100 degrees F)  Parametric studies will be performed to optimize process   conditions for the removal of representative films and   contaminants from processed silicon and gallium arsenide wafters.",

It is effective at low temperatures, its cost is low, and its   energy requirement is low because of the aforementioned synergy.

        "abstract": "Essential Research, Inc. proposes to build a combustion-based   thermophotovoltaic (TPV) electric generator using a fossil fuel   driven combustor, a selective emitter, a filter, and a photovoltaic   cell.  The operating point of the heat source and selective emitter   will be approximately 1700K.  The moderate operating temperature   was chosen to provide a system energy conversion efficiency of   greater than 20%, low NOx emission, and the high reliability   required for military operations.  The combustor will have a planar   configuration.  The selective emitter will be a single or   polycrystalline host material (such as garnet) doped with   rare-earth oxides.  The filter will be a combination of an infrared   (IR) reflector filter and a bandpass filter.  A narrow bandgap   photovoltaic cell will be fabricated by the organometallic vapor   phase epitaxy (OMVPE) deposition of InGaAs on InP substrates.  The   bandgap of the photovoltaic cell will be tailored to optimize the   conversion of the selective emitter spectra.  We believe that this   technology will provide excellent conversion efficiencies in a   commercially viable process. At the end of Phase I, we will   demonstrate this technology by developing an emitter/filter/cell   combination (a converter) having a 20% conversion efficiency.  In   Phase II, a prototype TPV generator to deliver 100-200 W of   electricity will be deployed.  A final system efficiency of grater   than 20% is anticipated.",

        "abstract": "In Phase 1, we propose to develop a battery of computerized tests to measure temporal acuity abilities in young adults and to determine empirically whether these abilities are independent of static visual acuity and also independent of test scores of higher mental and cognitive functions.  Current research in neuroscience assumes two parallel visual pathways from retina to visual cortex for processing distinctly different types of visual scene information.  One transmits fine detail from stationary, fixated areas but has poor resolution for dynamic features.  The second extracts more global information about spatial location, movement, and variation in luminance over time (flicker). This latter system is characterized by higher temporal resolution, shorter response latency, faster conduction time, but lower spatial resolution than the sustained pathway. In previous work, and elsewhere in a growing literature, it has been shown that individuals differ on these sensitivities.  Our empirical approach, derived both from neuroscience and differential test theory, will entail repeated measures of these sensitivities to determine: (1) test reliability and stability, (2) the unique factors evaluated by such tests, and (3) the relationship of \"new\" factors to \"old\" capabilities presently measurable and predictive of performance (e.g., scores on a computerized battery, scores on intelligence tests, tests of reading ability, scores on video games and flight simulations).  In Phase II: (a) uniqueness would be compared to existing Navy vision selection tests (AQT/FAR) and developing Navy computerized basic abilities tests; (b) predictive validities for one or more complex military performances will be investigated; and (c) the availability of electronically controlled lasers, liquid crystal emitters and portable microcomputers, particularly battery-operated versions with rapid onset visual elements (more than 20 msec), may permit improved assessment of these constructs.",

        "abstract": "Etalon has recently demonstrated a fundamentally new display technology based on Microelectromechanical (MEM) Strucutres.  Exploiting the phenomena of interference, these interferometric modulators (IMods) are simple membrane structures whose colors change when deformed electrostatically.  IMods have already demonstrated drive voltages of 25 volts, response times of 1 microsecond, and prominent hysteresis.  The latter is due to the electromechanical behavior of the device which precludes the need for TFTs in the fabrication of large arrays.  The nature of the IMods is such that it can be designed to switch from any color to black, white, or any other color, with theoretical pixel contrast ratios of 900:1.  Currently fabricated on glass substrates, the IMod is being developed as the core for a new generation of full-color, video rate, refelective Flat Panel Displays.  These displays are expected to consume as little as 5 milliwatts of power excluding driver circuits.  Power consumption could be further reducedby a factor of 8 or more if spatial dithering were used instead of pulse width modulation to provide gray-scale.  The goal of this effort will be to explore the potential of spatially dithered IMod arrays in fabricating high performance FPDs which draw only hundreds of microwatts of display power.",

        "abstract": "Recent demonstrations in the field of microelectromechanical structures (MEMS) have shown it to have great potential for applications in photonics.  The high speed, low-power, sub-micron motion which is typical of these structures makes them excellent candidates, particularly for tunable filters.  This is in contrast to acousto/electro-optic devices which tend to be power hungry, or piezo based devices which require labor intensive manufacturing. Etalon has developed a process for fabricating MEMS based tunable filters with the potential for an exceptional performance/cost ratios.  These devices take the form of micro-fabricated Fabry-Perot filters.  Fabrication is made possible by an innovative process which allows for the direct incorporation for high quality dielectric mirrors into structures which are surface micromachined.  The result is a device which is well suited for WDM applications.  Throughputs in excess of 90%, finesse > 300, response times of several microseconds, and tuning ranges over a micron can be achieved with these devices.  In addition, the benign nature of the fabrication process facilitates integration with driver electronics, making possible fully integrated optoelectronic filters.  Etalon will fabricate filters on glass substrates to be characterized.  Issues concerning fiber coupling and driver electronics will also be addressed.",

For high speed applications, it is desirable to utilize structures that have been designed to promote high levels of nonequilibrium electron transport as this allows realization of higher electron velocities than possible for diffusive charge transport. Devices based on InP are especially well suited for effective nonequilibrium operation due to the high saturated electron velocities, small electron masses, and large G-L intervalley separations exhibited by these materials systems. Phase I will examine InP based HBT structures grown by MOCVD that exhibit varying degrees of nonequilibrium electron transport due to 1) hot electron injection over an abrupt emitter-base potential barrier, 2) built-in electric field acceleration of electrons in a compositionally graded base layer, or 3) a hybrid combination of hot electron  launching  and electric field acceleration. The effects of various structural parameters on overall hybrid device performance will be evaluated and the approach(es) suitable for future Phase II optimization and high speed characterization will be identified based on the perceived capability to effectively utilize nonequilibrium electron transport characteristics.",

The method for preparing these structures employs carbon (graphite) nano fiber materials and results in an electrode having both high surface area and high electronic conductivity; two essential characteristics for EDLC electrodes.  The fabrication process allows the electrochemically active surface area, as well as, the crystallographic orientation of graphite crystallites to be controlled.  Additionally, the resulting structure may require no internal current collector, thus allowing DLC devices made from these materials to achieve high specific capacitance.  The \"binder\" used to prepare the structures is compatible with the carbon fiber materials and also contributes to the capacitance.  A novel activation process is also used to achieve high specific capacitance in the finished electrode structure.

This new approach to multiplexing is based on the development of optically-activated in-line switches to automatically route 100% of the optical power to successive network nodes, thereby eliminating power division losses and increasing the number of devices that can be multiplexed.  F&S envisions immediate use of such photonic switching products in combination with arrays of optical fiber strain and pressure sensors, already demonstrated and commercialized by F&S in cooperation with major U.S.  aerospace manufacturers, DARPA and DoD laboratories.  Such switches also have a very large potential market in self-routing optical fiber communication networks.  The program builds directly upon the documented experience of F&S and subcontractors in the commercialization of optical fiber coupling devices and the demonstration of nonlinear all-optical fiber switch concepts in the laboratory.

F&S has already developed a commercially-available absolute displacement sensor and, during previous and on-going SBIR and non-SBIR programs, has developed prototypes of silicon micromachined differential pressure sensors for monitoring pressure on aircraft and differential silicon-micromachined acoustic microphones for wind tunnel test applications.

        "abstract": "Metallic materials used in most contemporary structures are prone to failures associated with crack growth and corrosion. These problems are especially true for aircraft where corrosion-induced fatigue and cracking of structural components can lead to catastrophic failures, endangering human lives and costing millions of dollars in damage. Corrosion in aircraft most often occurs in inaccessible regions where it is difficult to detect using conventional techniques. Conventional detection techniques that are used on a scheduled basis are labor intensive, subject to technician error, and are costly to implement. The proposed Phase I SBIR program will focus on the development of remote arrays of optical fiber sensors for crack and corrosion detection in Naval metallic aircraft structural components, which will lead to tremendous time and cost savings by allowing on-demand maintenance instead of scheduled maintenance and repair. Optical fiber sensors provide a unique opportunity for the development of the types of nondestructive testing/inspection (NDT/I) systems required for the Navy's aircraft fleet. The most salient features of Fiber and Sensor Technologies state-of-the-art optical fiber strain, crack, and corrosion sensors is their ability to be self- calibrated throughout the lifetime of the aircraft in addition to their ability to be implemented within multi-sensor arrays to simultaneous map strain and corrosion across the aircraft structure.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate a novel process for electrochemical machining nickel superalloys and other hard, passive alloys.  Nickel-based superalloys are widely used in various industries, such as aerospace and automative industries.  However, nickel superalloys are difficult-to-cut materials.  Traditional mechanical methods failed to machine these superalloys.  Electrochemical Machining (ECM) is an effective method to machine nickel-based superalloys and other hard, passive alloys due to its high removal rate, no tool wear, and no burrs on the machined surface.  However, conventional ECM suffered in poor dimensional accuracy and surface quality caused by cavitation and pitting.  Our novel approach will improve the machining accuracy and surface quality for hard, passive alloys by 1) localize current, 2) maintain hydrodynamic uniformity in the interelectrode gap, 3) reduce electrode gap, 4) reduce electrolyte flow rate, and 5) prevent oxide film rehealing problem.  The overall objective is to develop a novel electrochemical machining process for hard passive alloys.  The specific objective in Phase I is to demonstrate the feasibility to machine nickel-based superalloys with our novel approach to improve dimensional accuracy and surface quality.  Anticipated Benefits:  Our novel process will be used to machine hard passive alloys, such as nickel-based superalloys.  If commercialized, the process is expected to have wide applications in aerospace, automative, and other industries which use hard, passive alloys.",

However, projections of the amount of digital traffic over transmissions links raise the distinct possibility that the demand for digital information tranmitted across the battlefield will outstrip channel capacity.  Being able to reduce the quantity of traffic over these channels without inhibiting the flow of information is important to the Army.  The most obvious approach to this problem is the use of data compression techniques.  Current battlefield transmission of reports, textual data, and database updates uses little or no data compression.  By applying state-of-the-art compression technology coupled with improved message transfer protocols, the Army will benefit by being able to transmit more information in less time across existing tactical links.

In many cases, meeting certain specifications can degrade the high performance characteristics originally identified for the chosen technology.

It is quite common for the battery being the largest and heaviest component.  In order to preserve high technical performance within a small form factor, it is imperative that power consumption be as low as possible and component miniaturized.  This proposal introduces a concept for developing a microSAW array by converting our already proven SAW oscillator and signal conditioning circuitry to a single application specific integrated circuit (ASIC).  Compared to our discrete hybrid circuit, an ASIC design will reduce power consumption and volume by 85% and 98%, respectively, for a single chemical microsensor subassembly.

In the baseline approach, two photovoltaic detector arrays in the MWIR band will  be used for producing the two color detector arrays. In the option approach, one photovoltaic detector array in the MWIR band and one photoconductive detector array in the LWIR band will be fabricated and assembled. In Phase I, detector arrays in various wavelength bands will be fabricated and tested.  Based on the evaluation of these arrays, an optimal two color array will be designed.  In Phase II, prototype two color modules will be manufactured.  In Phase III, the product will be commercialized for the Navy in specific, and the low cost HgCdTe detectors and arrays will be marketed through our catalog sales.",

The patented fiber-wall-filling technology precipitates insoluble inorganic salts within the microporous anatomy of paper fibers.  These inorganic depositions comprise the carbonates, silicates, sulfates, borates and phosphates of calcium.  Preliminary experimentation has shown up to 30% of precipitated calcium carbonate can be deposited in waste paper fibers to produce a thin hardboard.  A series of experiments will explore the effect of fiber-wall-filling on the properties of thin hardboard made from waste paper, with emphasis on fire retardancy.  Dimensional stability, water resistance, and mechanical properties will be studied on promising combinations of inorganic substances, loading rate and fiber types.  Process conditions and effluents will be monitored.  The most promising candidates will be identified for a Phase II study in which larger samples will be prepared for studying the production economics for the most promising niche markets.",

Improving the performance of the automotive class of inertial sensors through optimal filtering is crucial to their use for guidance applications.  The MIMU uses three accelerometers and three gyros.  The MIMU has analog to digital interfaces between the instruments and a microprocessor for performing the navigation and guidance functions.  The manufacturer is in the final stages of development of a micro-machined gyro for automobiles.  The accelerometer currently sells for $10.00 and the gyro has a target price of $30.00. The projected price for the complete MIMU is $500.  During pre-release of the submunition, a Kalman filter used to compare MIMU performance with the launch vehicle's GPS/INS should further reduce MIMU errors to 1 to 10 deg/hr.  Phase I of the SBIR will concentrate on: evaluation of the instruments to determine their error terms; design of the Kalman filter that will improve performance and provide transfer alignment for the guided submuitions application; simulation of the transfer alignment and navigation tasks for the submuuition; development of the MIMU specification and conceptual system, electrical and mechanical design of the brassboard and production MIMUs.

Conventional staring FPA spectrometers create   a three dimensional image (two spatial and one spectral) by either   using a sequence of narrow band spectral filters to slice the   spectral domain or to image one spatial and one spectral dimension   while scanning the remaining spatial direction.  These conventional   approaches are inherently inefficient because they discard   available photons.  We propose to investigate and develop a new   photon efficient spectral imaging technique developed by the Air   Force Rome Laboratory that multiplexes the spatial and spectral   information onto a FPA via a rotating prism, then demultiplexes the   resultant image to obtain the spectral images.  We propose to   define and design an imaging spectrometer for the SWIR, MWIR, and   LWIR bands.  The spectrometer will be designed to offer either   platinum silicide, HgCdTe or uncooled bolometeric infrared detector   technology in a self-contained imaging and analysis system capable   of supporting DOD and commercial applications.",

By measuring the time it takes for a step-waveform to propagate down and back an open circuited transmission line, one can determine the dielectric constant of the media.  Regression equations can then be used to determine water content from the dielectric constant.  Problems occur, however, in regions of high salinity (or electrical conductivity) in that the phase velocity and attenuation of electromagnetic waves as well as the characteristic impedance of the transmission lines are functions of frequency as opposed to constants.  This results in dispersion of the low frequency components and attenuation of the high frequency components of a TDR step-waveform which causes errors in the determination of water content.  This Phase I research project will investigate using existing electromagnetic and soil physics models to develop an algorithm to enable TDR systems to accurately measure water content and salinity over a wide range of water contents, salinities and soil types with a minimum amount of calibration.",

The   technique, phosphor thermometry, is based on the temperature   dependence of the fluorescence of refractory phosphors deposited in   thin (less than 50 micrometers thick) layers on surfaces of   interest, and has been successful in other applications.  The   method is absolute, independent of surface emissivity or   transmissivity, and can be performed remotely without damage to   aerodynamic or structural properties of the measured components.   The fluorescence is measured in a narrow wavelength range and over   a duration of only tens of microseconds, therefore, it is able to   be sensed in the presence of high temperature, blackbody radiation   backgrounds.  Because of the optical nature of the measurement it   is amenable to use optical fibers in pressure resistant probes.   Phase I will show the feasibility of the method, leading to Phase   II tests of CMCs in high pressure burner rigs.",

During the firing process, pressures on the order of 1,000 psi are generated,  with a large flow of high-temperature gasses.  Large stresses are generated at  the propellant-liner bond, and failure of this bond is one of the most common  causes of motor failure.

This project will develop a new technique for joining ceramic materials, used for these windows, to the metals that hold the windows in place. A pulsed induction coil system will be used to set up an induced current that causes the temperature of the material to rise rapidly to the joining temperature. Because currents are induced only within the portion of the specimen that is enclosed by the coil, rapid heating of just the interlayer can be achieved. The pulsed method uses a peak power that is many times greater than conventional induction heating, while greatly reducing the total heating time.  In previous work, a first generation pulsed induction system was built and tested by heating a copper ring 1000oC in less than one second.  In Phase I, test specimens consisting of disks of sapphire and tubes of stainless steel will be joined. The microstructure of the test specimens will be examined using Scanning Electron Microscopy and their mechanical integrity will be evaluated.  In Phase II, test specimens representing \"racetrack\" shaped windows will be joined and evaluated.  The windows will be large enough for testing with high power gyrotrons currently under development.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  High power gyrotrons are a critical component of Electron Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ECRH), a preferred and promising heating method for magnetic fusion plasmas. This project, if successful, will provide a method for attachment of low-loss windows in gyrotron oscillators with minimal residual stress, which will greatly increase window design flexibility.",

A soldier's survivability and effectiveness will be enhanced by a new light weight body armor and helmet system which deflects bullets rather than stopping them.  By covering all the oblique areas the soldier presents to the enemy in his standard fighting positions, the armor system will significantly reduce his vulnerable silhouette area making it more difficult for the enemy to score a lethal hit.  This Phase I project will develop and test flat plate samples of armor using light weight materials and several innovative designs and configurations.  Foster-Miller will employ its expertise in materials, physics and ballistic protection to deliver a detailed armor system concept for the individual, complete with weight estimates, ballistic coverage, ballistic holes and bullet deflection paths.  The concepts for flat plate testing will include surface modification of existing ballistic materials, the incorporation of slip planes designed to separate from the armor taking the projectile with it, with an overall construction of novel design.  Based on the results of this testing, combinations of these concepts may be proposed for the final system.

C/HfC composites can offer the requisite strength, chemical inertness and erosion resistance at nozzle peak temperatures (2500 C-3450'C) . In addition, nozzle components based on C/HfC material system offer the following advantages over currently used materials (W-Cu alloys): light weight, thermal insulation, higher performance, higher design flexibility.  C/HfC system also offers higher oxidation resistance compared to the only other alternative materials: graphite and C/C.  The innovative fabrication process proposed by Foster-Miller offers net- shape capability, versatility, potential for low-cost, and can produce parts with higher density and oxidation resistance comparable to parts made by the current process (chemical vapor infiltration CVI).",

Ideally, the battery should meet or exceed current voltage, ampere-hour and discharge ratings and should be benign if disposed of in a marine environment.  Foster-Miller proposes to develop polymeric environmentally degradable batteries using one of three strategies to combine conductivity and biodegradability in one material system.  Our technical approach fuses together our expertise in energy storage devices, biodegradable polymers, and polymer chemistry.  In Phase I we will identify candidate materials for each of the three approaches, then assess the feasibility of each approach, taking into account the conductive and degradation properties of the selected materials and the ease of material synthesis.  Based on these results, we will perform a risk assessment of the three approaches, and develop a replacement strategy for the substitution of our materials into a battery system.  The ultimate goal of this program is to develop a polymeric environmentally degradable battery that can function as a replacement for today's primary (single-use) batteries.",

During battle, this might require that damaged HMMWVs be removed from the field when they are most needed!  Foster-Miller proposed to develop a new type of HMMWV body panel repair patch - the ambient temperature cure hole repair patch (ATCHRP) - that can be applied in the field at room temperature using simple hand tools and cured on-site within hours to product a durable, adherent composite patch that matches the strength, toughness and CTE properties of the surrounding metal.  Our approach combines five enabling technologies to produce a field repair kit that is ideal for patching body panels on Marine Cops and commercial vehicles. These key technologies include corrosion-inhibitors, adhesion-promoters, ambient temperature cure hydrocarbon resins, composite processing and CTE control.  The field kit can be tailored for repair of aluminum, composite and/or steel vehicle body panels.  In Phase I, we will develop ATCHRP formulation, produce patched sheet metal test panels and analyze samples for key performance properties.",

The conformal microchannel circuit covering will   direct a flow of non-electrically conductive liquid coolant over an   avionics card and all its components.  Preliminary calculations   show very acceptable pressure drops and temperature rises in the   LFO microchannels.  The conformal covering will be removable for   card repair.  The space needed for the conformal microchannel at   the card surface will come from space saved at the card core.   Namely, the central 125 mil aluminum heat sink (or flow through   channels) of todays standard modules will be replaced by a thin,   stiff composite core, possibly hollow.  Such a hollow core, used to   carry liquid coolant, could optionally increase the cooling   capacity of the proposed LFO concept beyond 1,000 Watts.

In conjunction with our commercialization partner, Williams International, both current recuperator and future engine requirements (i.e., IHPTET Phase III JETEC engine) will guide initial development of a hollow core C/C recuperator.  The high thermal conductivity and low density of the C/C hollow core structure, will enable more efficient, higher operating temperature recuperators that most the XHPTET weight and performance goals.

This anti-icing surface treatment prevents ice adhesion to the surface as well as preventing further ice formation.\n\nSince the surface treatment prevents ice from adhering to the aircraft it overcomes the central limitation of a forced air system:  its inability to remove tightly adhered frozen deposits.  In addition, unlike other non-chemical deicing techniques, the anti-icing surface treatment inhibits ice formation on the aircraft surface after deicing, thus providing \"holdover time\".\n\nIn Phase I, we will demonstrate the material's ice adhesion strength reducing properties and its ability to inhibit ice formation.  We will develop application methods for typical aircraft substrates, and examine the material's durability and adhesion to these substrates.

        "abstract": "Fracture Analysis Consultants (FAC) proposes to develop a 3D,   boundary element-based system for detailed stress analysis of   composite joints.  The FRANC3D system will be able to model bolted   and bonded joints of arbitrary geometry, and include clamping and   contact stresses from bolts.  The system will also accommodate any   number of discrete cracks in arbitrary locations and orientations   in the joint, and simulate the arbitrary growth and interaction of   such defects, automatically updating the mesh with each change in   geometry.  The FRANC3D system is based on a topological database   which efficiently integrates and controls object-oriented solid   modeling, automatic mesh generation and modification, a boundary   element analysis (BEM) engine, fracture analysis, and a full range of results   visualization.  The BEM engine will be based on a new   Symmetric-Galerkin, hypersingular formulation which will   substantially increase efficiency for large 3D problems, while   retaining the ability to model cracks with a single domain approach.   The main goal of Phase I will be to demonstrate our capabilities in   BEM formulation, solution of benchmark 2D problems, and 3D contact   stress analysis.  In Phase II we will concentrate on 3D BEM engine   development and on simulation of crack growth.",

        "abstract": "In discussions with Lloyd Clark during September 1995, FTI learned   that the needs of WK/AARA as announced in the AF96-123   solicitation are evolving.  While there is still interest in   \"Data Extensions for Imaging Sensors\" as expressed in the   solicitation, WL/AARA's emphasis is shifting toward RF sensors   and programs such as MSTAR, NCTI and ARAGTAP.  We propose to   center our proposed effort on the underlying needs expressed by   Mr. Clark for an integrated ATR test and evaluation planning   tool.  We will use our current experience in developing the   Integrated Desktop Analysis and Planning System (IDAPS) to   design and prototype an end-to-end ATR Test and Evaluation   Planning Suite (ATEPS).  FTI will design an extensive ATEPS   prototype to integrate intelligently measurements databases,   existing and future target, background, propagation, and sensing   models for a variety of wavelengths, program planning and   scheduling databases, ATR algorithms commercial-off-the-shelf and   custom applications, and evaluation tools.  With these elements,   FTI and its consultant, Dr. Fred Garber, will design ATEPS to   provide WL/AARA with a convenient, comprehensive, and logical   software environment and approach to identify ATR requirements,   deriving traceable needs, designing experiments to answer critical   questions related to traceable needs, monitoring status, and   evaluating the results.",

The acceleration gap must satisfy three major criteria:  hold-off of the applied 100 kV voltage, low transverse impedance for beam break-up minimization, and low longitudinal impedance at the beam modulation frequency and harmonics to minimize power loss.  Preliminary studies indicate that the transverse impedance should be less than 5400 Ohms/m, and longitudinal impedance for 11.4 giga-Hertz should be less than 2.5 Ohms/m.  Phase I will explore various gap geometrics and materials to optimize the gap design.  In addition, two novel design techniques will be introduced:  (1) the use of a new insulator technology in which the insulator is comprised of thin layers of standard insulating material alternating with finely spaced floating metal electrodes, and (2) the use of thin metal films to cost standard ceramic insulators.  These designs will lead to the manufacture and test of a prototype induction acceleration gap during Phase II.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  The acceleration gap design should satisfy the technical requirements for the two-beam next linear collider (TBNLC) induction cells and should lead to significant reductions in the construction and operational costs of induction accelerators. The technology could also apply to other induction accelerator applications, for example, Free Electron Laser drivers and material processing.",

        "abstract": "Proposed is an investigation into the use of flexible, extremely strong and tough, superelastic Nitinol shape memory alloy as a means of dramatically improving puncture resistance for personnel body armor.  The Nitinol material is proposed as a surface material or coating for reinforcement or organic fiber fabrics and/or composites or aramid and UHMW polyethylene used in the current body armor systems for military and police personnel.  These Nitinol enhanced material systems will benefit users by providing bullet blunting protection and deflection without dramatically increasing the weight of the lightweight composite protective clothing.  The armor would benefit from the improved cut and puncture resistance and improved flexibility that the Nitinol would give the protective clothing over present fabric and material systems used.  Superelastic Nitinol is a flexible (almost rubber-like), very tough (4 time the stored energy of high strength steel) metal alloy of nickel and titanium.  Known for its shape memory response at one temperature phase, Nitinol exhibits a superelastic (fully elastic and recoverable strain limit of 8-10%)  response when used in the appropriate temperature phase.  In the superelastic phase, tests have demonstrated its ability to increase puncture resistance for certain materials by 100%.",

As the Army strives to become more representative of the American population in its gender and racial content, it is also possible that some part of the Army population may not be afforded adequate protection with masks of one standard size of any design. GESAC proposes to Integrate various elements of computer modelling and scanning technologies with the aim of developing a procedure to design, test and manufacture masks.  The final goal of this project is to develop a mask design, testing and manufacturing technology which will make it possible for the Army to obtain protection of its soldiers at a reduced cost in a timely manner.",

        "abstract": "Development is proposed of a new, rotary form of Stirling cryocooler which  offers longer operating life and much lower vibration than reciprocating forms of  cryocoolers.  The proposed machine has fewer moving parts to wear and can be  completely balanced to eliminate vibration in all planes by simple  counterweights on the shaft, which is not possible in reciprocating machines.   The rotary design not only alleviates drive loads, vibration, and wear, but the  inherently elongated compression spaces and limited compression ratio are  very well suited to the heat transfers and thermodynamics of a Stirling-cycle  machine.  The rotary configuration permits an exceptionally compact,  smooth-running, high-efficiency system.  The design could readily be adapted to different temperatures and capacities for  specific cryogenic applications or for more utilitrian commercial and domestic  freon-free refrigeration needs.  Also, the technology would be applicable to the  development of external-heat-powered rotary Stirling engines for quiet, low  pollution, multifuel, waste heat, cogeneration, and solar power applications.",

They are equipped with high explosive and fragmenting warheads to achieve target defeat but in the process produce unaccceptable target venting and agent dispersal.  The need exists for a warhead payload which can effectively defeat chemical and biological agents, is capable of being weaponized within current and developmental munitions delivery platforms and operational use requrements and scenarios, and does not suffer from collateral damage shortcomings.  General Sciences, Inc. (GSI) proposes a multicomponent approach for the in-situ destrction of chemical/biological agents, command and control facilities and life support systems, with minimum agent venting and collateral damage.  The proposed approach is based on advance Hi-Therm Materials which in a non-explosive manner can generate high temperatures rich in UV, high energy yields, reactive/species contaminants as well as reactive fragments.  The main objective of the proposed effort is to demonstrate that this tecnology can be tailored into a multi-effect payload so that maximum effectiveness is achieved with the minimum payload weight.",

        "abstract": "Under separate efforts in the past, our team has developed technologies for a novel high speed 3D Camera and a true volumetric 3D display device. The unique features of our 3D Camera include the capability of providing instantaneous, full frame 3D range images at a CCD camera's frame rate (30 frames per second or faster), a capability that no other currently available 3D image acquisition systems or 3D rangefinders can achieve at any cost. Our 3D display device is able to generate volumetric 3D patterns in true 3D space by a set of activated voxels that emit light. Besides no moving parts and high voxel bandwidth, additional advantages of our 3D display approach are all angle of view, simultaneous multiple user views, large viewing volumes, flexibility in voxel size and shape, inherent parallel architecture, and without the requirement of viewing spectacles. The primary objectives of Phase I is to study the feasibility to seamlessly integrate a 3D camera system with a volumetric 3D display monitor, so that the integrated system can capture continuously 3D images of objects in the scene at a standard video rate (30 fps) and display the captured 3D images immediately on the 3D display monitor.  In our phase I effort, we will focus on the interface and 3D data exchange protocol between the 3D camera and 3D monitor.  Both current designs of the 3D camera and 3D monitor will be modified and optimized.  Preliminary experiments will be performed to validate the interface design. In Phase II we will design a high speed 3D Camera/Monitor system suitable for real-time 3D image acquisitions and visualization.",

Installed on powerful computers and applied to a highly detailed battlefield imagery as viewed through a multitude of sensors.  The ray trace (RT) approach will calculate and provide input information to imbedded sensor models that would be available in actual field testing.  Sensor models include infrared (scanning and staring FLIR, integrators), radar (RCS, SAR, PA), laser (LADAR, LIDAR, designators), and visible.  RT is computationally expensive, however; it provides freedom from traditional limitations of polygon rendering.  RT is distributable over a refraction.  An intelligently devised RT approach could accomodate the equivalent of 300 million polygons.  This effort explores the alogithms necessary to render 20 million solids at 5 hertz refresh and 640x480 24 bit resolution.  This effort supports automatic target recognition studies and addresses the need to add a multi-spectral signature generation node to the Defense Interactive Simulation community.  The design approach will facilitate the addition of other non-signature areas such as vulnerability analyses.",

A structural analysis methodology will be developed based upon proven advanced nonlinear finite element techniques and  experience with structural plastics.  This methodology will be applied to the design of a Government specified outer head.  A materials search and synthesis (Phase 1 Option), will be conducted in paralllel, resulting in selection of material(s).  Polyurethane plastics will be selected based on maximizing strength and ductility requirements, and requirements the analytic design dictates.  These selected plastics will then be processed to accurately reflect the manufacturing process and geometry of the head.  Selected plastics will then be mechanically tested to obtain the mechanical parameters used in the analysis.  An initial set of parameters will start the analysis and an improved set will be used in the final design.  A detailed manufacturing procedure will be developed which includes mold design, preprocessing, mold prepartion, mixing, demold procedures and quality control.",

The objective of this Phase I effort is to demonstrate novel robust analysis approaches to SAR focusing, radio frequency interference (RFI) rejection, and image formation and registration.  Radar provides all weather capability.  Wide bandwidth provides fine range resolution.  A long coherent synthetic aperture provides fine cross range resolution.  Foliage and ground penetration requires a low operating frequency.  Wide bandwidth at low frequencies entails interference from radio and TV stations and from cellular and mobile radio.  The emphasis of the proposed work involves the attainment of wideband coherence over extremely long synthetic apertures while rejecting RFI.  The result of such work will be techniques, algorithms, and software that produce high quality (resolution, accuracy, and dynamic range) SAR images suitable for high performance targeting or mapping under difficult imaging conditions.  The robust autonomous motion compensation techniques (a) can operate with only the radar data, 9b) do not require targets in the scene, and (c) can compensate for large trajectory deviations.",

In this proposal we suggest space-time methods and algorithms capable of providing significant capacity increases for both CDMA and TDMA, as well as improving performance of CMDA in overlay situations.  Specifically, we propose several space-time receiver configurations and a novel adaptive eigencancaler algorithms, as approaches that directly increase users per cell in CDMA and improve the frequency reuse of current TDMA systems.  The Phase I goal is to prove feasibility in a realistic time-varying multipath cellular wireless channel.  The phase II product will be a real-time COTS multiple-signal processor, programmed to combine and process signals from several antennas, to optimize each desired user's signal (e.g., minimum BER) while suppressing power from competing users.  It is shown that diversity processing and interference cancellation in adaptive arrays provide significant capacity increases with just a few antenna elements and hence at low-cost and with only modest through put requirements.  Analysis and preliminary results are provided to support the soundness and utility of the proposed methods.",

The sensor offers a low-cost, all-weather/all-visibility-conditions high-resolution imaging capability from a small UAV to individuals and small units for surveillance and targeting purposes.  In addition to being able to see through smoke, fog, etc. and its around-the-clock mission capability, SAR provides the valuable range information and it's particularly sensitive to man-made metallic objects such as tanks, artillery pieces, and various ground vehicles.  A special proprietary radar configuration, made possible by GORCA's data-adaptive motion compensation techniques, results in the ultra-lightweight/low-cost construction.  The sensor does not require the placement of INS or IMU equipment on board the UAV.  Depending on system parameters, the total weight of the proposed imaging payload is expected to range between 0.1 and 0.5 lb. A side-looking, lightweight, low-profile microstrip SAR antenna is to be employed.  The rest of the payload is expected to occupy few cubic inches.

Current methods for the detection of Campylobacter require isolation, cultivation, and biochemical characterization, thus making the process slow and laborious. Immunological detection methods are available; however, they lack the sensitivity that is afforded by cultivation.  The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been reported to be an extremely sensitive detection method with detection limits as low as a single organism under ideal conditions.  In clinical specimens, such as feces, however, the sensitivity of the method is significantly reduced. For this reason, researchers have combined immunomagnetic separation with PCR to produce extremely sensitive detection methods for other pathogens in fecal specimens.

        "abstract": "This Phase I proposal describes an effort to develop an Electronic Countermeasure (ECM) hardened proximity fuze sensor applicable to support munition, general purpose bomb, smart-munition and submunition fuzing applications.  ECM hardening is achieved by operating the RF sensor at the 60 GHz molecular oxygen (O2) atmospheric adsorption peak.  Short-range, radar proximity sensors operating at this frequency would be virtually impervious to stand-off jammers due to the relatively high atmospheric attenuation of the jamming signal, combined with the favorable range advantage enjoyed by the fuze sensor along with the difficulty in producing high levels of RF jamming power at this frequency.  Utilizing Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) technology, all RF and millimeter-wave circuitry, including the antenna, will be integrated into one or two MMIC chips of minute dimensions.  The 60 GHz fuze sensor described in this proposal utilizes frequency-modulated, continuous wave (FMCW) radar techniques in order to remain compatible with existing sensor signal processing circuitry and also to minimize production costs.  The RF circuitry consists of a high-power voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)/buffer amplifier MMIC operating at 20 GHz and producing approximately 0.5 watts of RF power, which drives a second MMIC chip consisting of a Schottky-diode tripler, a passive antenna diplexer, a homodyne receiver mixer, and a single-patch microstrip antenna.  This functional partitioning scheme leads to significant advantages: 1) no millimeter-wave packages or interconnections are required, and 2) no exotic MMIC processes are required, since the tripler MMIC is totally passive.  During Phase I the sensor will be designed and analyzed, suitable MMIC processes will be selected, preliminary MMIC design will be completed, and a Phase II proposal will be generated.  During Phase II, the MMIC chips will be designed and fabricated and a prototype 60 GHz fuze sensor will be designed, fabricated, and performance will be verified utilizing an artificial target generator which will also be developed during the Phase II project.",

Accurate modeling   of these structures can eliminate the iterative process that is   often required to correct for the coupling and manufacture a   working device.  In this proposal, we discuss a method to evaluate   the commercially available electromagnetic simulation tools that   can be used in the design of multi-chip modules and multi-function   MMICs.  This research will provide MMIC designers with invaluable   information about powerful electromagnetic simulation tools.  The   first step in the evaluation is to establish a performance   criteria to judge the various simulators.  We will then evaluate   the different simulators against this criteria.  The end result of this research will be a thorough evaluation of   the electromagnetic simulation tools that can model the separate   needs of the multi-chip module and the MMIC designer.  The   research will be organized into a decision tool that will link a   designer to an electromagnetic simulator that best fits the   design needs. Through the use of this decision tool, the   designer can reduce the time and money required to produce a   working device.",

The output bus from the detector array contains 64 channels with each channel operating at up to 20 Mbit/sec. All control and digitizing circuits reside on the same chip. Data on the detector array can be accessed in random. The TTL compatibility of the proposed detector array allows the digital output channels to be interfaced directly to other electronic processors or memories. The power consumption of the proposed device is comparable to a 256kbit RAM chip which is less than 0.1W. The proposed device is applicable to any page-oriented memories such as holographic, two-photon and spectral hole burning based storage systems. In comparison, CCD arrays, which is traditionally used for 3-D memories are bulky, difficult to use, and expensive (for multi-channel device).",

An innovative antimatter production technique is proposed in which quantum mechanical deBroglie wavefunctions are phase conjugated to produce antimatter using a process analogous to optical four-wave mixing.  An interference pattern is created by the superposition of an object particle beam and reference particle beam traversing a nonlinear medium, which has a lattice spacing of the same beam traversing a nonlinear medium, which has a lattice spacing of the same relative magnitude as the particle deBroglie wavelengths.  The medium deforms due to the interference pattern and diffracts a second counterpropagating reference beam, creating a phase conjugate (antimatter) beam which retraces the original object beam path.  The object beam simultaneously interacts with the second reference beam to create an interference pattern which diffracts the first reference beam, producing an amplified object beam.  The amplified object (particle) beam and phase conjugate (antiparticle) beam are created at the expense of the two reference beam wave energies in a process fundamentally different than current high energy pair production techniques.|  Benefits:  The proposed technology may provide a cost effective method to produce antimatter in sufficient quantities for spacecraft propulsion and other commercial applications, including on-site medical radiation treatments, nondestructive material testing, and material processing applications.|",

HTI will design an Adaptive Response Filter (ARF) that will add human response degradation to any simulator on the DISNET without requiring any modification to the simulator or to the net.  Every entity in a DIS simulation exists solely by its issuing and responding to messages called Protocol Data Units (PDUs).  By intercepting and modifying these PDUs, ARF will give the effect of degraded response, both from the view from the affected simulator and its view (representation) to the rest of the simulation.  ARF will connect between a simulator and the DISNET, bi-directionally classify PDUs on the fly, and either alter or pass them through depending on the nature of the weapons effect being played.  In the process, ARF will log pertinent data for postmortem analysis of system response.  Initially, the ARF swill impose time delays based on the extensive research conducted by DNA-RAEM (Kehlet) and be controlled by a DNA player or proctor.

The RPC functions by sensing the movement of a tag (glued to the dorsum of the queen's thorax) passing by a sensor located within the hive.\n\nThe feasibility of the RPC to certify the presence of the marked queen, thus excluding the possibility of an Africanized queen, will be proven with a work plan that includes construction and testing of a brassboard version of the RPC.  The testing includes both laboratory tests and field testing with active hives.",

        "abstract": "This proposal presents a program for the development of a cruise missile payload that can effectively inhibit combustion engine operation of an adversary's motorized military equipment without adversely affecting personnel or the environment.  This approach utilizes a proprietary fuel combustion inhibitor (FCI) in liquid aerosol or micro-encapsulated dust.  The proprietary FCI is in many ways ideal for this application because: it is a liquid under all conditions, and hence enters the combustion zone in condensed form, vaporizing and pyrolyzing in the flame in high concentration; on a weight or volume basis it is orders of magnitude more effective than Halon 1301 in inhibiting fuel combustion; it is denser than aluminum and makes excellent use of limited volumes such as those available in submunitions; questions of extinguishment effectiveness for engine nacelle fires are already being addressed under a USAF Phase II SBIR contract; toxicology risk assessment for the proprietary FCI is presently underway at USAF Armstrong Laboratory; the atmospheric fate and environmental effects of the proprietary FCI are currently being examined at the California Institute of Technology and the University of North Texas; and methods of dispensing the proprietary FCI are currently under development.  The key technical issues addressed in this Phase I program are: aerosol cloud size and density required for desired military effectiveness; aerosol effectiveness against engines with intake air filters, and effects on personnel.",

        "abstract": "Chemical and mechanical paint stripping methods can present health hazards and produce hazardous waste especially when lead based paints (LBP) are removed.  The objective of this proposal is to investigate the design of a microwave applicator for more efficient and safer removal of paint.  Substrates to be considered include wood, metal, masonry, and composites.  The microwave applicator, power supply, safety systems, related engineering issues, and cost will comprise the details for the Phase I investigation.  To achieve rapid heating of the surface layers and prevent damage to the substrate, both CW and pulsed microwave power systems will be considered.  Safety will be guaranteed through the use of flexible shielding materials and sensors interlocked with the power supply. Because optimal applicator design depends on the microwave absorption of the substrate, arrangement and type of susceptors will be an important aspect of the study.  In the case of LBP additional use of glass powder for lead vitrification will be investigated.  There will be a subcontract to CEEAM Penn State for materials microwave characterization and assistance with applicator design.  The final result of this proposed study is to deliver designs for a portable microwave device that will safely remove paint from a variety of structures.",

Presently, no means exists to affordably, reliability, and efficiently connect the laterally traveling irrigator with a stationary mainline.  Consequently, most irrigation is presently accomplished with much less efficient means.  Water, electricity and fertilizer are wasted resulting in reduced yield and groundwater pollution.\n\nThe project objective is to prove operational the invention of a simple and reliable automated connector.  One such connector has already been fabricated and 'bench' tested.  The project begins by attaching this 'prototype' connector to a lateral move irrigator and installing a water supply mainline including spaced poppet valves.  The irrigation system may then be tested to prove that a navigation system inherent to the invention is workable.  A working navigation system will in turn then provide for successful location and coupling to each of the successive poppet valves.  The project also serves to establish workable interaction between the connector and the water supply means.",

HyperKinetics has demonstrated simple completely solid bullets that accelerate during flight due to combustion with ambient air of a solid fuel (magnesium metal) on the outside of the bullet.  Test bullet accelerated from Mach 2.7 to Mach 3.25 in  distance of 100 yards (190 g acceleration).  It is believed this technique can be used at velocities well into the hypersonic regime and over a wide range in projectile scale sizes.  It appears that this technology can be a very cost effective method of achieving the hypervelocity needed for kinetic energy weapons or munitions designed to penetrate hardened targets.  We propose to conduct further experiments with bullet sized (.30 inch dia.) projectiles to improve the ignition and combustion of the fuel and to achieve higher velocities.  We also have developed a novel bullet configuration that allows bullets with a longer aspect ratio to be spin stabilized.  Penetrator bullets of this type will be made in an accelerating configuration.  We will investigate available Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) programs and penetration modeling software for use in Phase II to determine the applicable envelope of this technology.",

Laboratory measurements are based upon immunological binding of these hormones.  Color tests utilizing colloidal gold or enzyme mediated color changes have been linked to immunological binding and applied to hormones to yield non-quantitative yes or no tests. These methods cannot provide semi-quantitative determination of the hormone concentration without introducing procedural complicaitons.  Innovation Associates proposes to develop test strips for homones utilizing an innovative technology which will permit the binding between antibody and antigen to be translated into a visually apparent color response.  Strips will not utilize enzymes or colloidal gold.  Semiquantification of analyte will be achieved by comparing the location of the color change on the strip to a concentration scale int he manner of a thermometer.  Feasibility of the technology will be demonstrated in Phase I be applying it to the development of test strips for the metabolites of the female reproductive hormone estradiol and progesterone in urine.  The method will be rapid (10 minutes or less), simple (requiring only exposure of the strip to a diluted sample), and strips will be more stable than tests employing enzymes.",

Our preliminary cost and feasibility estimates of commercial systems indicate that transition from lab to commercial systems will be reliable and economical.

Having developed industrial applications for the transportation market using a variety of sensor technologies, IEM will evaluate four technologies:  ultrasonics, stereophotography, magnetic field measurements, and radio direction finding.  IEM will test these four technologies in the automotive environment.  Based on the outcome of the testing, a unique prototype of the feasible technology will be produced incorporating innovative features appropriate for the feasible technology.",

Such a system could easily be coupled with state-of-the-art medicaments to manage a wide range of disease states including hypertension and diabetes.  When coupled with appropriate sensors, this system could also provide means for protection of military personnel against chemical attack.  Most implantable microfluidic systems have been structured around the concept of an active pump.  We have demonstrated in the Regional Technology Alliance for High Aspect Ratio MicroElectroMechanical Systems (DARPA HI-MEMS), of which IEP is a member, that microfluidic systems can operate with constant pressure reservoirs as the power source.  The major objective of this Phase I activity is to identify the mechanisms and technologies to integrate the valve system (developed as a component of the DARPA sponsored HI-MEMS Alliance) into a fully functional, implantable monitoring and control system.  We will identify the technologies and development resources which are adequately advanced for utilization in completion of our novel microfluidics system.  The major deliverable for Phase I will be a feasibility report and Phase II development plan.",

System hardware will include multiple graphics accelerators  interfaced to a commercial graphics workstation. System software will employ both efficient incremental computation of perspective  transformations to implement image warping, and high-quality  filtering to eliminate visual artifacts.  All algorithms will be  parallelized and fully implemented on the chosen multiprocessor system in order to achieve real-time performance.In addition to more conventional inverse mapping, forward mapping techniques will  also be investigated for performing the necessary spatialtransformations.  The final choice of algorithms will be based upon  an analysis of both the computational efficiency and the perceptual  acceptability of the graphics obtained in an air-to-ground  targeting application. Past perspective transformations performed using a dedicated graphics accelerator can be expected to provide a cost effective solution to the computational problems that are routinely  encountered invarious applications such as mission rehearsal, part-task training, flight simulation, scientific visualization, virtual reality systems, video entertainment systems, and medical imaging.",

        "abstract": "The proposed innovation of this Phase I is to combine three distinct   and complementary technologies to create a flexible, powerful, and   extensible infrastructure for interconnecting heterogeneous sources   of data. Autonomous agents will perform network management and   administrative duties, and provide customized services to end   users of the network.  The agents will operate with a CORBA-based integration backbone and WWW-based clients.    CORBA is a distributed object management framework that has been increasingly   adopted by both government and private projects where large-scale distributed   systems are needed.  It provides distributed services (e.g. security and   namespace management) and facilitates the integration of legacy applications   and databases.   WWW offers a low-cost client mechanism to distribute data   and services.  Both are based on open standards and have extensive commercial   support.  Agents will provide the automation necessary to manage, maintain,   and extend a large-scale network composed of disparate and separated sites.    Without autonomous agent technology, the shear amount of work needed to   process content and manage the network would make this problem intractable.    Agents will also make the system easily extensible, allowing the insertion   of new capability by creating new agents.  Combined, these technologies   provide a firm base and a clear path for system evolution.",

CORBA and OLE provide a software bus for integrating COTS and legacy applications across all platforms as objects.  This provides an assembly base for taking legacy and commercial software components and combining them.  By merging WWW, JAVA, CORBA, and OLE an organization could integrate all of their legacy and commercial applications easily with the WWW, and make them available for use by anyone over the Internet.  This would enable the development of such things as Internet workflow and remote collaboration as well as \"off the shelf systems integration.  This Phase I will demonstrate how US Navy personnel can collaborate with contractors over the Internet using commonplace WWW browsers and commercially available desktop tools.  The approach will utilize innovative collaborative technologies such as the WWW, JAVA, OLE and CORBA along with easy to use COTS component software products called ComponentWare.  This allows the US Navy to easily assemble Internet/WWW based collaboration systems using existing legacy and desktop applications.

Contemporary cognitive scientists agree that learning is embodied in the fluid medium of language; it is through language that we understand the world.  Language development can only occur in a rich social environment, where ideas are transformed, reformed, and dynamically changed by the participants in a conversation.  Youth with disabilities face particular difficulties in participating in the exchange of language within regular school settings.  Classroom settings which emphasizes individual student work rather than social interaction create few opportunities for students with disabilities to learn through the exchange of language.  Hardware and software which enable students to communicate are not, by themselves, an answer to this problem.  The culture of the classroom must also foster inclusion, providing disabled students with a role that contributes towards group goals and thus is valued by peers.  Cooperative learning activities can provide the structure needed to include these students in learning activities and increase communication between disabled students and their peers.  We propose creation of software that greatly increases the likelihood that students and teachers will meet with success in implementing cooperative learning activities.",

Such fusion would be particularly relevant for partially obscured and/or background blended targets.  We propose a multi-layer perceptron neural net for implementing the multi-look fusion.  This neural net would be similar to that recently used by other ARL ATR researchers.  Performance would be further enhanced by smart fusion of individual sensors classifier outputs, either on the same or multiple platforms, i.e., multi-sensor fusion.  Our approach would start with the fusion scheme being investigated by us under another SBIR for Target Acquisition/Target Recognition (TATR) encompassing man-in-the-loop decision making.  For the ARL SBIR, we will enhance the TATR fusion scheme by building an artificial intelligent agent that augments and automates aided fusion function, e.g., adaptive thresholding for multi-sensor fusion.  This intelligent agent would also incorporate production rules for associating different views of the same object for multi-look fusion.  the resulting algorithms will be applicable to ATR fusion implementations both on vehicles and fusion stations.  Our multi-look and multi-sensor classifier fusion approaches are very practical for operational scenarios, because neither depends on precise co-registration of the various disparate sensors.",

        "abstract": "An ultrasonic Rayleigh surface wave method is propose to determine   residual stress depth profile in aluminum aircraft wheels.  The   Rayleigh wave method has several distinct advantages.  The residual   stress depth profile can be easily obtained by altering the   penetration depth of the Rayleigh wave. The Rayleigh wave is bound   to the surface of the wheel, enabling measurements on curved and   other irregularly shaped surfaces.  Also, the Rayleigh wave   approach can discriminate between tensile and compressive residual   stresses and eliminate the effect of texture on the residual stress   determination.  Initial measurements have demonstrated these   capabilities on non-ferrous and ferrous metals.  The result of the   proposed research program will be a field portable inspection   system based on a portable computer that can be operated remotely   by a single user.  This will enable the stress levels and their   variation with subsurface depth to be determined rapidly and the   data to be stored for later analysis.  The results obtained from   this instrument will enable the fatigue life of the aircraft wheels   to be predicted and incorporated into appropriate design models.   Preliminary contacts with commercial users have demonstrated a   significant interest in this proposed system, simplifying the   commercialization process.",

The methodology incorporates the additional functions, not common to single processor software development, of: re-structuring, partitioning, allocation, and performance evaluation.  The proposed environment consists of a modular software tool set which can operate upon knowledge base, which develops along with the development of the software system.  The modularity of the tool set allows alternative versions of the tools to be developed, to address the different execution constraints that may be needed in a design, such as in real-time, embedded systems.  The project is based on earlier/current research and prototype tool set development at the University of Connecticut.  Phase I will investigate a specific application domain for the initial systems development, based on this methodology.",

It is noted that many NAVSEA systems have been analyzed using Nijssen Information Analysis Methodology (NIAM) for the 1991 Model to Analysis Protocols (MAPS) reports.  Although NIAM is appropriate for analysis and documentation of many data aspects of the involved systems, the object oriented framework required for the current project also requires hierarchical class, dynamic and functional models which are not adequately handled by NIAM.  The main part of the project will consist of the analysis, system design and object design phases characteristic of OMT.

This design study will utilize ICC's existing rapid cooldown Infrared Detector Assembly (IDA) packaging technology together with AEL industries' work on HTS spiral antennas to produce a design which meets the requirement of rapid cooldown and antenna performance capability is not degraded as a result of cryocooling or final packaging constraints. A new antenna concept operating in the UHF/VHF/SHP bands for anti-radiation seeker applications, Radar Warning Receiver (RI-M), and Electronic Support Measures (ESM), is conceived.  This antenna is based on the optimal application of High Temperature Superconductor (HTS) Technology to two-arm or four-arm spirals coupled with efficient cryogenic packaging making the entire package field usuable. Superconducting spiral antennas offer significant improvements over their non- superconductor or copper based counterparts.  These improvements were demonstrated as part of the OAR/U.S. Navy contract N00014-94C-002, ARPA/U.S. Army contract DAAB07-92-C-1617, and AEL patent application P104-132 and internal research and development efforts.

The RPEM system is based on conventional strain and rotation measuring devices whose data are used to compute a stiffness matrix [K] for the unknown foundation, which is then matched with values previously determined for known foundations.  The system will be simple in design and available for use by highway agencies and by the consulting engineering and testing community.  The Phase I program addresses the feasibility of (1) making the required strain and rotation measurements on piers and abutments subjected to truck and thermal loadings: and (2) developing software which can compute the unknown foundation characteristics from this measured data.

These transients can cause mission critical components to fail. Varistors are increasingly used to avoid such failures. The current varistor devices, however, are not well suited for high frequency applications and the increasing trend towards device miniaturization. This program seeks to direct efforts to remedy this. Our technical approach is to synthesize and fabricate varistors from titanates whose grains and grain boundaries have been band-gap engineered at nanometer scale ( 10-7 to 10-9 m). It is anticipated that the proposed varistors will be orders of magnitude smaller, lighter, and yet perform significantly better than conventional varistors. During Phase I, ADI will establish the proof-of-concept. Phase II effort will seek to optimize the device and its fabrication, and field test prototype varistors. Phase III will commercialize the technology.",

It is anticipated that the future inductor based technologies, such as EMI suppression, would require significantly higher energy density inductors. Fundamental breakthroughs seem essential to meet this need. This program seeks to demonstrate one such breakthrough. The technical approach is to synthesize proprietary nanomagnetic materials and then prepare inductors of unmatched performance. Phase I will seek to systematically establish the proof-of-concept; Phase II will scale up, design, assemble and field test prototype inductors; while Phase III will commercialize the technology.",

These operations are carried out simultaneously, in a single machine, by passing ambient air through a moving bed of pellets.  However, simultaneous control of both these processes is very difficult.  Overdrying of pellets is a common problem that costs several million dollars to feed processing industries due to loss in the weight of the finished product.  Avoiding of overdrying can cause insufficient cooling that can lead to spoilage and spontaneous heating of pellets in the storage.  This research aims to develop a computer program for the numerical simulation of various types of coolers/dryers used in the feed processing industry.  This computational tool can be used for developing various control strategies for these coolers.  During Phase I of this research, the ability of such a computer code for process optimization and design improvments of cooler performance will be demonstrated.  During Phase II, the numerical model will be validated under actual field conditions and the capabilities of Phase I computer code will be enhanced.",

This Phase I proposes to create an electronic logic function with an infrared integrated optical input. The infrared signal output will be through a previously developed modulator, to be integrated post Phase I. The Phase I logic device will consist of a room temperature intersubband photodetector at 10 micrometer wavelengths for input coupled to a resonant tunneling diode for logic function.

This proposal is oriented toward the class of interference generally referred to as overvoltage transients.  Means for mitigating these transients include gas discharge tubes, and various solid state devices.  Each of these has their own advantages in particular circumstances.  In the late 1980's, a new class of metal polymer composites were introduced that hold the potential for replacing all of the above devices in the majority of circumstances at greatly reduced cost and weight and with enhanced flexibility in device and system design.  However, it appears that in previous efforts, a dominantly empirical approach was followed, with insufficient understanding of the underlying electrophysical phenomena.  A first step toward correcting that situation was taken by Integrated Sciences under the sponsorship of the U. S. Army's Harry Diamond Laboratories, wherein the quantum tunneling aspects of the materials were successfully explored and demonstrated.  The object of the present proposal is to complete that effort by an analysis and demonstration of the mechanisms of polymeric avalanche, and the tradeoffs between metallic quantum tunneling, polymeric avalanche, material, morphology, and device geometry.",

In addition, a cost evaluation will be performed in order to reduce the cost of such microclusters to about $600.  Microinstrumentation clusters are becoming increasingly important in a number of application areas and are needed to measure many environmental parameters, such as pressure, temperature, acceleration and vibration, humidity, and gas concentration.  These clusters should be very small, stand-alone, wireless, and capable of being deployed easily in the environment of interest.  Although much effort has gone into the development of the individual components of such clusters, including the interface and signal processing integrated circuit chips, and solid-state sensors and actuators that have increasingly been reduced in size using silicon micromachining techniques, very little hasbeen done to address the critical questions of how these complex systems can be packaged and assembled in a practical, low-cost, and high-volume manner.  This project aims at developing such techniques and at eventual manufacturing of multi-sensor instrumentation systems.  Anticipated Military Benefits/Potential Commercial Applications of the Research or Development:  There exist many defense applications for these miniature clusters, such as miniature weather monitoring stations, drifting buoys, and wearable soldier monitoring systems, as well as commercial applications, such as distributed data gathering systems, tracking of corporate deliverables (\"assets\") on a global scale, personal health monitors, embedded sensing clusters for controlling sophisticated manufacturing/processing equipment, and automotive systems.",

It will also examine   the corresponding data requirements of the users of the reference   systems data, with emphasis on the required reference frame and/or   geographic datum, the required data accuracy, and other data   attributes needed.  It will define a recommended common reference   frame for use by all cooperating participants in a theater of   operations.  It will also recommend methods for applying   conversions from other, existing reference frames and geographic   datums to the common frame.  These methods will address both   pre-mission conversions and real-time conversions, as a function of   the mission, data sources, and user requirements.  Finally, this   effort will identify pertinent information management factors   related to the optimal use of multi-source data by multiple users.",

Mode-routing is an IFOS proprietary method allowing different signals to take different paths in optical circuits by using different optical modes.  It enables large numbers of multiplexed nodes by avoiding losses inevitable in usual WDM single-mode architectures. Research Objectives:  In Phase I, IFOS proposes to analyze, design, and feasibility demonstrate a practical mode-routing architecture implementation for microdevice multiplexing. Description of Research:  Phase I Tasks are to:  (1) analyze mode-routing architectural configurations including microdevice interfacing/multiplexing, (2) design/simulate implementations thereof, (3) procure/fabricate components, (4) construct experimental 2-node feasibility prototype, (5) test/evaluate prototype.Anticipated Results:  In Phase I, IFOS expects to feasibility demonstrate an implementation of the basic mode-routing concept with a 2-node systems prototype using micro-sensors.  Phase II will implement an expandable network incorporating several MEMS and MOMS.  IFOS mode-routing architectures are expected to provide power-efficient designs for advanced multi-wavelength multi-device photonic systems resulting in expandable, high-capacity, high functionality sensor/control networks.",

The integrated structure is based on an IFOS proprietary combination of simply implemented potentially low-cost technologies:  (1) Side-Removed Fibers (SRF), (2) Active Optical Polymer (AOP) Overlays, (3) Single-Mode Fibers (SMFs) and Dual-Mode Fibers (DMFs), and (4) Intra-Core Fiber Gratings (ICFGs).  The SRF/AOP and SMF/AOP/DMF combinations form asymmetric couplers whose transmission can be made particularly wavelength selective via judicious parameter choices.  This feature is enhanced by ICFGs.  Tuning is via the AOP nonlinearity.  Phase I objectives are to: (1) make use of IFO's extensive lightguide modeling and analysis capabilities to design an electro-optically tunable fiber-optic filter to satisfy the requirements and predict its performance, (2) implement a feasibility prototype demonstrating the effect of parameter choice on wavelength response and tunability, and (3) characterize the TOF behavior (tuning speed, tuning range, resolution, insertion loss) with consideration of the end-user requirements.  First generation IFOS TOFs will allow optical network signal selection/routing with minimal local optical power.  All-optical versions will enable self-routing.",

All molecular states are displayed in its symbolic form, exactly as one would find in the literature.

Ozone   decontamination technology shall be tested on agent simulants in a   laboratory breadboard system as the overall objective of this   research proposal.  Ozone can decontaminate both biological and   chemical agents.  The biological inactivation mechanism by ozone is   directly applicable to the necrosis of biological agents.  Ozone   lyses pathogen cell walls, releasing the cytoplasm into solution,   destroying the cell in one step.  Ozone can also oxidize chemicals   rapidly and effectively, due to its high oxidation potential.  In   reaction with many organics, oxone adds to teh double or triple   bond site to yield unstable ozonides.  The unstable ozonides may   continue propogation steps dioxide and water.  This general   mechanism is the predicted mechanism for ozone reactions with   agents such as HD, VX, GD, GB and GA.  The development and control   of a means for applying ozone for the emergency decontamination of   field personnel, equipment and water supplies will provide the   Department of Defense a versatile decontamination method with   widespread utility.  Ozone decontamination technology could be   further applied commercially in emergency Haz-mat responses and in   agricultural chemical control.",

Each component in the repository has an associated algebraic specification that describes both the type signature of its interface and its computational behavior.  The OBJ3 language and system is used to do equational reasoning via term rewriting to efficiently support component searching based upon both type matching and behavior matching.  This approach is capable of filtering out all components whose interface or computational behavior is incompatible with the query.  This greatly improves the selectivity of component retrieval and reduces human effort required to identify the useful components in the set of components retrieved by a query.  The new methods enable effective use of large software repositories by improving the useful yield of queries and reducing the amount of knowledge users must have about repository contents and organization.  This approach also helps improve repository component quality by enabling more effective automated testing.",

Several of these diagnostics rely on high-resolution spectrometers to measure the spectral characteristics of the plasma light, which can then be used to determine plasma properties.  This project will develop a high-performance data acquisition and processing system to improve the time response and accuracy of the digital recording of this spectral information.  The digital recorder, which will be initially configured for operation with a high-speed, 512 by 512 pixel back-illuminated CCD (BCCD) array, has been shown to have a 6-fold increase in photoelectrons detected per pixel and a signal to noise ratio five times greater than previously available. The spectral signal will be converted to digital format immediately after the BCCD array - maintaining its high signal-to-noise ratio. Real-time compression can then be performed on the digital data, allowing the data to be written to RAM memory or directly to a mass storage device. The system design can either be incorporated into a standard PC or be placed in an embedded PC-architecture for stand-alone operation.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential. Commercial Applications as described by the awardee: The combination of high-temporal and high-spectral response, that the BCCD array adds to the spectrometer recorder, should position the recorder an order of magnitude ahead of any spectrometer system currently available. These characteristics have multiple applications in the areas of chemical reactions, explosives and combustion processes.",

The radiation damage problem is particularly acute in the case of finely segmented detectors and silicon drift chambers which are frequently used in hostile radiation environments. Current oxide-passivated, ion-implanted detector designs and fabrication processes are too complicated, and major cost improvements can be accomplished by simplifying the design and manufacturing process. This project is aimed at reducing detector cost by addressing the following changes:  a new source for uniform Si wafers, a new approach to wafer polishing, and combining surface barrier and diffused junction contact technologies with an improved approach to oxide passivation.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  There are important markets for reliable silicon radiation detectors with lower cost, improved performance and better resistance to radiation damage.",

Invocon, Inc. proposes to design an inspection system consisting of an energy source and a detector.  Designated FERET sytem, (Field Energy Recoid Emission Technology), it would detect substances identified as having explosive capabilities.  Detection is accomplished by using high energy particles to non-destructively penetrate volumes of freight and luggage as they move from location to location in automated handling systems.  The system would alarm when target substances are detected, thus identifying the suspect freight or luggage item for removal and manual inspection.  It will also incorporate a neural network concept using spectrum distribution and patter recognition schemes to amplify a desirable pattern and suppress unwanted noice.  Essentially a dynamic filter, the network would be trained a priori by previously calibrated results, thereby increasing its detection sensitivity while reducing false  alarms by detecting and cataloging patterns that exist in day-to-day operation.  All detection, discrimination, and classification data processing relating to the detection and interactive learning system can be performed on PC level computer hardware, thus resulting in a uniquely efficient design.",

This is done with blackbody sources that depend upon large size and thermal mass to achieve uniform temperature; therefore, they are unsuitable for incorporation directly into the instrument. Also, calibration is infrequent and difficult, particularly for instruments stationed at inaccessible locations.  This project will develop  a miniature, electrically-modulated blackbody source weighing a few grams and occupying a fraction of a cubic centimeter. The heart of this source is an ion-beam textured filament which achieves temperature stability by heating and cooling on a time scale much faster than thermal diffusion. Its low thermal mass, near-perfect emissivity, and high temperature coefficient of resistivity cause it to precisely follow its drive current, permitting instantaneous feedback and temperature control. Its low power demand will permit remote, battery-powered operation under computer control. \n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  The proposed device is a simple, light-weight alternative to traditional benchtop blackbody sources. By reducing weight, complexity, and cost, it should enable applications beyond the reach of current infrared devices.

The process can be compared with charging a capacitor. The device will consume very little current.  The technical approach is different from ion exchange techniques.  It is completely different from an activated charcoal system, in the sense that ionic contaminants are carried in a charged double layer.  When the electrical power is switched off, the system will release the captured ionic species.  This rejuvenates the system. The technology will be designed into a small lightweight, hand held device for use by an individual soldier, to desalt water for drinking.  the device is expected to remove pathogens, suspended materials, and dissolved solids (including heavy metals) from fresh, brakish and salt water.  Design capacity of the unit will be at least two liters per day of drinking water.  The unit will be designed to be easily transported and operated by its user.  Phase I activity will include surveying of the range of alternative technologies; and comparing performance of the best of these against the performance of a prototype model of a capacitive deionization unit.  During Phase I, the optimum operating parameters for the capacitive deionization system will be defined based on preliminary testing.",

This work focuses on the selective extraction of contaminants from soil using a bio-reagent, i.e., naturally occurring chemicals produced by plants.   The process provides for the highly selective solubilization of heavy metals and radionuclides without extracting significant quantities of essential soil cations.    An ex-situ soil cleaning process, in which the soil remains in a transport container through the decontamination process, will permit recycling of the bio-reagent.   When extraction of the contaminants has been completed, the container of clean soil returns to its origin.  Rocks, vegetation, roots, etc., need not be removed  and high clay content oils are accommodated. The new bio-reagent will be recycled using an electrokinetic separation module.   Because the bio-reagent is essentially a \"natural\" product,  any solubilizer residual in the soil is not expected to cause regulatory concern.   Phase I  will confirm the effectiveness of this bio-reagent on a wide range of contaminants and identify  engineering parameters  needed to carry out a full scale demonstration of the process.  \n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:   The process should provide for cost-effective decontamination of a wide range of heavy metals and radionuclides from contaminated soils.",

(ITN/ES) has products in advanced power generation, storage, and distribution using thin-film power generation via photovoltaics, fuel cells, batteries, and thermoelectrics and is the technical lead/commercialization arm of a DARPA Vapor Phase Manufacturing (VPM) consortium to apply intelligent processing sensors and techniques to complex thin-film copper-indium-diselenide (CIS).  Critical to the success of this program is the ability to isolate a given material attribute in situ to monitor critical material properties, such as composition and stoichiometry for films such as CIS.  Ellipsometry, particularly multiwavelength ellipsometry, has the potential for monitoring film deposition and growth and providing a means for in situ process control.  Overall objective of the proposed work is to develop an in situ method for process control of CIS photovoltaics based on spectroscopic ellipsometry and to improve analysis algorithms for the handling of ellipsometric data.  Specific objectives for Phase 1 of this program are to 1) construct a multiwavelength parallel-detector spectroscopic ellipsometer system, 2) study properties of CIS films, 3) correlate these data with ellipsometric data of the same films, and 4) identify which film(s) and process(es) will be considered in a Phase 2 program.",

This project will demonstrate a free electron laser which uses axial laser interaction rather than the common transverse interaction.  This permits the selection of operating parameters that result in inherently phase stable operation.  The laser would serve as a basis for a commercially producible, 17 gigahertz, 500 megawatt rf power source suitable for linear collider applications. \n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  The successful development of a phase stable 500 MW axial free electron laser would result in a significant decrease in the cost of constructing a 1 TeV level linear collider by greatly reducing the number of rf power devices required.  The peak power and energy per pulse that can be developed by the axial FEL could reach levels high enough to be useful for defense applications.",

        "abstract": "Airborne biological materials are potential problems outdoors (e.g., biological warfare agents or human, animal, and plant pathogens from natural sources and argicultural activities) and indoors (e.g., in food and drug processing facilities and operating rooms).  People increasingly recognize bioaerosols as a cause of preventable airborne infections and hypersensitivity diseases, as well as related absences and low productivity in \"sick buildings\".  In the biological defense field, early warning and evidence of a possible attack enables defensive measures to be taken.  Therefore, effective and efficient collection and detection of biological materials is desirable.  The specific aim of the proposed project is to develop micro-orifice impingers which can introduce airborne biological materials into a liquid phase for a miniature detection  system.  Using the micro-orifice technique will enable the miniature impingers to sample small volumes of air into liquids in short time periods.  Micro-orifice impingers that operate under low pressure drop and low jet velocity will consume the lowest  possible power and prevent or minimize the damage of biological agents during sampling.",

        "abstract": "Using new low bandgap GaSb photovoltaic cells, JX Crystals has recently demonstrated functional thermophotovoltaic prototype generators.  While it is generally believed that the cost of materials makes non-silicon photovoltaic cells prohibitively expensive unless one can develop thin film cells, this thesis is wrong for thermophotovoltaic cells.  Specifically for the GaSb cell, the Ga and Sb material contribution to the electric power cost is only 7.3 cents per Watt.  The real cell costs in high volume production are associated with process costs, and the GaSb cell process can be made inexpensive by copying the silicon solar cell process.  This has already been done by using diffusions for junction formation and converted silicon Czochalski pullers for crystal growth.  JX Crystals is proposing to undertake several additional process improvements imitating the simple silicon solar cell process, at every step from crystal growth to wafer sawing to wafer handling.  By imitating the silicon cell process, JX Crystals believes that Ga Sb thermophotovoltaic cells can be made in high volume production at a cost of under $1 per Watt.",

        "abstract": "This proposal addresses an approach to millimeter wave imaging called encoded image detection (EID).  The concept offers a means of achieving a low cost, all weather seeker for smart munition and submunitions.  Its low cost potential makes adaptation of the imager also attractive for a variety of other military applications such as search and rescue, surveillance, and security.  Most current development of millimeter wave imaging is based on focal plane array (FPA) technology.  A FPA imager has speed and (theoretical) sensitivity advantages over a method of scanning the image with a single detector, but these advantages will be realized with significant system cost and complexity.  In addition, a practical issue of gain stabilization for a thousand or more independent, FPA radiometric channels has not been resolved.  Gain stabilization is not a critical issue in the alternative EID approach.  Furthermore, the simplified architecture of an EID millimeter wave imager, the key to cost reduction, makes possible a rugged construction of good sensitivity without sacrifice of resolution.",

To date, crash dynamic analysis and crash design  criteria have been based mainly on rigid ground impacts and are therefore  not of real use to the Navy, where nearly 90 percent of crashes occur into  water.  When a helicopter crashes into water, it usually is very unstable,  inverts and rapidly sinks.  Some of these accidents are survivable, but  little has been done to reduce the injury from impact and increase the  occupants chance of survival by introducing crashworthiness principles  specifically protect against the special hazards associated with water.  The determination of impact pressure and force distribution time histories  on typical hull shapes in combination with achieving water impact  survivability is therefore of prime interest to helicopter manufacture and  operator.

Because the glass viscosity is a function of temperature, most active control systems monitor the temperature of the molten glass.  However, temperature readings are not reliable for measuring viscosity.  This project will develop a sensor that can measure the viscosity of molten glass directly, providing better process control. The sensor will use velocity and attenuation measurements of ultrasound pulses, as a function of frequency, to derive the viscosity of the glass. We propose to investigate a completely noncontact sensing approach, laser ultrasonics, which is very suitable for the hostile environment of glass manufacturing and can be used in forming and drawing operations without interfering with the process.  Phase I will prove the feasibility of using laser ultrasound to measure the viscosity of molten glass, complemented with an experimental demonstration.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  The potential benefits of laser ultrasonics measurement of viscosity during glass production include better parameter control of the forming process, robust control under changes in glass batch composition, viscosity profiling in three dimensions, and fast scanning of the melt gob.

The approach is to embed an optical fiber with attached ferrules in the composite.  The outer end of each ferrules will be encased in a removable male mlod.  After curing, the mold will be removed, leaving the outer end of the ferrule exposed in a recess in the composite.  The design will address problems such as the need for tight tolerances, the sensitivity of the fiber end to scratches, serviceability, and maufacturability.  The point of ingress/egress may be in a region of the structure insensitive to stress concentrations, or in a region of the specifically built up to accomodate the ferrule.",

Without technology to convert   raster drawings to 3D product data models, this situation is likely   to persist for some time as over 50% of all new drawings are still   being produced on paper.  This backlog of manual drawings is a   serious problem to logistic support as most engineering projects   involve incremental changes to, or reuse of, components in existing   designs.  We propose a semi-automated process for converting to 3D   product-data.  Because many technology components for performing   this activity already exist, the proposed system leverages COTS   geometric modeling, product data management, optical character   recognition, and raster to vector software.  The strategy applies a   \"create once-use many time\" philosophy that uses the product data   manager to focus on the earliest referenced revision of single   components to solid models.  The strategy leverages the geometric   modeler for assembling solid model components and automatically   generating engineering drawings as well as eases the editing of   solid models for creating part revisions.  Because complete   conversion of all drawings is not required in this approach, the   conversion will be faster, cheaper, and less prone to error.",

These three facts pose a significant challenge to the formulation of requirements for complex, coherent, complet, and comprehensive set of requirements for the system, the various models of the system (the \"source\" models) must be correlated in a fashion that permits system designers to understand the interrelationships, constraints, etc. between system elements represented in those models.

The project will go beyond the three base technologies by introducing explicit narrative structure into the software design record and packaging it in a multi-media presentation similar to computer-based training (CBT).  For any particular task, the narrative structure will lead the developer along the most relevant threads in the web of recorded decisions and artifacts.  The narrative structure will \"raise the stakes\" of the design process by engaging the developer in a dialogue, inviting him or her to become an actor in the ongoing story, highlighting and giving substance to the implications of design decisions.",

Visualization of the large areas needed in these simulations requires that the data be compressed to very low bit rates to make storage and transfer feasible. An important design requirement for consideration is that the data compression scheme needs to exhibit high fidelity for achieving realism. The primary objective of this Phase I effort is to develop real-time data compression algorithms to support virtual reality data handling. Our approach to achieving high volume data compression that preserves important structures in the data (e.g., discontinuities in an image for draping) makes use of wavelet based algorithms we have developed in a current Phase II SBIR effort supported by NASA. Specifically, we have shown that the generic wavelet compression scheme can be further improved by using information about the type of terrain in an image resulting in compression ratios close to 200:1. Based on our experience with fractals, wavelets and other compression methods, we find that the conjoint spatial- Fourier domain techniques such as wavelets are very effective both from a real-time computational point of view as well as an optimal data compression point of view. hi the case of \"draping\" a scene for virtual reality, the reduced resolution image set inherent in wavelet based compression will also aid in rendering a perspective image without accessing the entire compressed image.",

On the other hand, narrow angle sensors provide the details   on the target for ATR, but suffer from a very small area of   coverage.  To exploit this natural complementarity, in this Phase   I, LNK supported by Dr. Rama Chellappa from the University of   Maryland, proposes to develop a proof-of-principle sensor fusion   ATR system for classification of ground targets from wide angle low   resolution and narrow look high resolution sensors.  We plan to   demonstrate the algorithms using SAR and FLIR imagery.  The   proposed approach exploits the concept of active vision or directed   vision.  Our approach involves three major steps of processing.   The first step is to detect likely areas of target presence called   Focus of Attention (FOA).  The second step is to register the SAR   image to the FLIR image for extracting the corresponding regions of   FOAs detected in SAR using a feature based registration scheme.   The third step is to align a selected catalog of BRL-CAD models of   targets with the image features in the high resolution FLIR for   recognition of the target, using a closed-form line matching   technique followed by refinement using a non-linear least squares   treatment proposed here.

Loss of the compressive layer, which relaxes with time at   elevated engine temperatures, reduces the resistance to high cycle   fatigue failure, shortens component life and limits engine   performance.  Retention of surface compression will improve engine   robustness and maintenance economy.  The rate of residual stress relaxation depends upon the degree to   which the surface is cold worked.  The cold work produced by   different SE methods can be controlled, allowing current and new SE   methods to be developed for better retention of surface   compression.  A model expressed in terms of properties measurable by x-ray   diffraction will be developed to predict the relaxation of   compressive residual stress produced by shot, laser shock peening   (LSP), and gravity peening in Inconel 718 and Ti-6A1-4V at engine   temperatures.  Improved retention of component life extending   compression produced by low cold work SE, and the feasibility of   modifying SE process parameters to improve retention of compression   in Ni and Ti alloys will be demonstrated in Phase I.

        "abstract": "Lanxide Corporation proposes to demonstrate innovative approaches for fabrication of thin wall ceramic sheet.  The goal of this project is to make a low weight ceramic recuperator suitable for aero-engine applications.  Lanxide will extend current processing techniques using commercial paper mill for forming continuous ceramic preform sheet with goal of reducing recuperator wall thickness from a current developed 0.035 inches (for future hybrid-electric vehicle usage) to 0.015 inches (necessary for flight applications).  Reduction in recuperator element wall thickness is key to reduce weight allowing adaptation for aero-turbine engines.  A recuperated aero-engine allows efficiency enhancements leading to significant cruise range improvement up to 60%.  Design of the thin wall ceramic recuperator and its integration into the Teledyne Model 205-2 turboshaft aero-engine will be performed by Teledyne Ryan Aeronautical. For Phase I DuPont Lanxide Composites will assist Lanxide in hardware fabrication of a demonstration thin wall sector recuperator which will be tested at Teledyne for performance utility characteristics including efficiency, temperature and pressure.",

These sensors such as silicon and CCD arrays are very well   developed resulting in high resolution and low cost.  However,   these sensors are limited to a spectral response of 900 to 1000nm.   The mixing laser (MIXL) uses a non-linear material doped with   lasing ions to create a self frequency summing or difference   frequency mixing device.  The MIXL is diode pumped and can be used   to up-convert infrared radiation from 1.0um to 4.0um to the   visible or near infrared where conventional silicon and CCD   arrays operate. The MIXL can be installed on fielded sensors   such as guided munitions to provide extended silicon operation   into the eye-safe region or to provide frequency agility in the   1.5 to 2.0um region. The MIXL can also operate as a narrow band   filter and as a laser protection device for military imaging   applications.",

        "abstract": "Electrooptic (EO) materials with large optical nonlinearities   (electrooptic coefficients) and high thermal and temporal   stabilities are crucial components in many photonics applications   for aircraft avionics systems.  Although polymeric NLO materials   are excellent candidates for these applications, current materials   experience dielectric relaxation of the aligned structure which   prevents them from being used in practical devices.  Laser   Photonics Technology, Inc. proposes the development of a new class   of second-order NLO ionic polymers with large nonlinearities, and   exceptional thermal, temporal and photophysical stabilities.  The   second-order NLO chromophores are designed to possess a   zwitterionic structure enhancing molecular hyperpolarizability that   is obtained through the use of novel sultone chemistry.  These   chromophores are then covalently attached to a high glass   transition temperature polyimide backbone.  Ionic structures have   been shown to exhibit large B values, but their alignment by   electric field poling has been complicated (hindered) by Coulombic   (repulsive) interactions.  The proposed approach circumvents these   problems because ionic structures are formed only during the high   temperature poling process.  It thus ensures the ease of material   processing, effectiveness of electric field poling and great   thermal stability of induced noncentrosymmetry.",

Our novel approach to these requirements comprises a diode-pumped, high power, electro-optically tunable, single frequency monolithic microlaser.  In such a device, the output frequency is tuned simply by applying a voltage to the laser. This is in contrast to slower frequency control techniques which use piezoelectric or pump power modulation.  The anticipated performance of the monolithic device yields a source with a frequency-fast linewidth of less than 10 kHz; making it ideal for coherent communications. Microlaser technology combines this potential with compactness and low cost and represents a substantial improvement over current state-of-the- art non-planar lasers.   The Phase I program includes the demonstration of two narrow linewidth, long term frequency stable microlasers.  The frequency stability of the microlaser prototypes will be demonstrated by beat frequency tests between the two independently locked lasers.",

The laser system takes advantage of wavelengths available with cascade processes under resonant pumping conditions from certain rare-earth doped materials.  Room temperature operation is achieved by exploiting the unique properties of single crystal fiber lasers, which are ideally suited to operating on relatively low gain transitions in quasi-three-level systems due to the inherent energy confinement afforded by a guided configuration.  By exploiting low thresholds, excellent mode quality and compatibility with available diode laser pumping, the proposed approach for the medium power, cw mid Infrared laser system contains several innovative elements for power scaling with minimal risk of damage, all from a very small package.

The LHPG is a fast that requires only small amounts of starting materials and is not sensitive to imperfections such as strains and doping nonuniformities, thus allowing an efficient and cost effective means of selecting and testing a large number of candidate materials.

In order to monitor key physical parameters in this environment, it will be necessary to develop new concepts in sensor design to measure such things as temperature.  Present day sensors will not operate reliably in this environment and are much too large.  Fiber optic sensors offer a possible solution to this problem.  Lasergenics Corportation is proposing to investigate single crystal fibers of MgAl2O4 and Y2O3 doped with neodymium for this application.  These materials can withstand the harsh environment that will exist at temperatures as high as 2300 degrees Celsius.  We are proposing a unique approach that would allow the measurement of temperature with a single crystal fiber optic.  The temperature will be determined by measuring the flouorescence decay time as a function of temperature using the phase shift method.  This concept will be tested during the Phase I effort.  For the Phase II effort we will determine sensor and data transmission link design characteristics usable in this environment, fabricate a breadboard and test it in a jet engine environment.  Anticipated Military Benefits/Potential Commercial Applications of the Research or Development:  This program can result in a new concept for fiber optic sensors for high temperatures in harsh environments such as jet engines.

        "abstract": "Laser threats are typically linearly polarized at an arbitrary   azimuth.  This makes it difficult to implement sensor and personnel   protection based on polarization rejection.  Addition of a linear   polarizer at the aperture removes any ambiguity in the threat   polarization state and permits use of rejection schemes based on   electric vector orientation.  The polarizer must be lightweight,   compact, and tolerate very high power.  A metal grid polarizer is   the only type of polarizer which has potential to meet these   requirements in the infrared beyond 3um wavelength.  Current   production methods for metal grid polarizers use the classical   technique of grazing incidence deposition of a metal on   photoresist.  Contrast of these polarizers is limited to 200:l   even at l0 um wavelength where performance is best.  Ion beam   etching techniques can produce a metal grid with much cleaner   geometry and a resulting polarization contrast as high as 50,000:1   at 10 um.  In addition to potential use for laser threat   protection, this type of polarizer will enhance performance of both   active and passive infrared sensor systems.  Leonard Research   Corporation will investigate fabrication requirements needed for   ion beam etched metal grid polarizers to yield very high contrast.   Production of this type of polarizer could be accomplished in a   Phase II program.  Commercial availability of high contrast, low   cost, infrared polarizers will lead to a renaissance in infrared   sensor design, infrared ellipsometry and FTIR spectroscopy.",

Efficient fiber-optic transport, frequency agility (1-150 GHz), ultrahigh dynamic range (120 dB (1 Hz)) and simultaneous, continuous RF phase control of the treansmitted millimeter-wave signal is accomplished with the same modulator.  This allows military phased-array systems to exploit the advantages of fiber while reducing system cost and complexity.  Furthermore, fiber links based on the feedforward transmitter can serve as a connecting infrastructure for fiber-fed antennas in conventional microwave and future high-bandwidth mm-wave wireless cable-television and cellular communication systems.  Since this work is of obvious commercial and military interest, it falls into a genuine \"dual-use\" category.  The feedforward mm-wave optical transmitter does not suffer from bandwidth limitations inherent in feedback techniques such as phase-locked loops, and is constructed entirely from commercially available componetns that are all OptoElectronic Integrated Circuit (OEIC) compatible.  Furthermore, due to a unique mechanism in the robust feedforwar design, no high-frequency optoelectronic components are required to transmit the mm-wave signals.  Prior success with the feedforward optical transmitter provides strong evidence for the successful completion of phase I of this effort.",

This system will be used for short-range wind sensing.  The low power of this application leads to tremendous advantages for field use.  The system will operate with an electrical input of less than 10 Watts, and it will operate from -50 degrees to +50 degrees C.  It will be conduction cooled, with no need for fluid or forced-air cooling.  The pump laser is a single diode in the power range from 2 to 4 Watts peak power.  These diodes cost $600.  The laser diode will be operated at a duty cycle below 20%.  The Phase I will experimentally demonstrate the Q-switched laser which is used in the transceiver.  The work would be done in coordination with a TRP effort headed by Honeywell Corporation.  The goal of that effort is to establish a commercial/military business for coherent laser radar.  The first product from this business would be a short-range wind-sensing radar to be used to improve weapons accuracy for the Army's Apache helicopter, which is produced by TRP team member McDonnell-Douglas.

We will investigate techniques to scale our existing laboratory OPO from its present 2.5 watt power level at 3.4um to the ten watt level.  This OPO is pumped with 13 watts from a 1064 nm. laser diode pumped Nd:YAG laser, is singly resonant at the 1.54 pm signal, and uses periodically poled iiNbO3 (PPLN) as the nonlinear crystal.  Pump energy depletion is an amazing 85%.  To obtain higher OPO outputs in the 3-5 micron range, the PPLN needs to be scaled to larger thickness so that the average power density of our present unit can be maintained.  Also, if we can drive the OPos with multi- transverse mode Nd:YAG lasers and sufficiently maintain the OPOs' spectral and spatial beam qualities then the resulting mid-infrared source will be simpler, more efficient, and hence less costly than if we used a single-transverse mode drive Nd:YAG laser.  Therefore, the Phase I program will concentrate on poling thicker PPLN crystals and building and characterizing a cw singly resonant OPO with A multi-mode pump laser.  The Phase II goal is to build a cw OPO using a 50 watt Nd:YAG laser and pumping an OPO that can deliver up to 10 watts over a large portion of the 3-5 micron wavelength range.",

Lightec proposes to demonstrate a novel scheme by which very weak signals (as low as a single-photon) at 1.5 um to 3 um are amplified with at least 8 dB improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio prior to photodetection. This method holds considerable promise over conventional detection techniques and competing optical amplifiers. The proposed method for amplification of very weak signals has recently become feasible due to the availability of nonlinear crystal qualities that are conducive to efficient OPA action. It has also benefited from the recent commercial availability of single mode pulsed lasers which can be used to pump the OPA system. The Phase I effort will include experimental determination of optical losses, and amplification gain and efficiency for three different crystals in the 1.5 to 3 um wavelength range. Phase I will also demonstrate an OPA at 1.6 micron wavelength using a 1.06 micron pump laser, and will design a system for efficient continuously tunable amplification in the 1.5 to 3 micron wavelength range.",

LinCom proposes to show how excess weather margin  can be used with varying coding gains to provide a dynamic data rate with constant  link performance.  A concatenated 'outer' code together with the present 'inner'  code will allow variable coding gain.  By turning one or both coding algorithms on  or off, the channel link margin can be controlled.  This technique allows high  data rates during clear weather and above normal performance during periods of  rain.  In Phase II, a hardware and software design will be generated for a scalable,  adaptable baseband processor that will perform dynamic data rate and coding  processing, and from the design a prototype VME based processor will be developed  and demonstrated.",

The use of advanced, lightweight structural materials in vehicular applications presents an opportunity to enhance the effectiveness of Army units.  Through more effective energy utilization, fuel will be conserved, which will simplify the logistics of supplying fuel for army vehicles in remote locations.  Before these benefits can be realized, proven industrial processes must exist that can be used to economically produce components with complex geometries out of these lightweight materials.  Powder injection molding (PIM) is one process that has potential to economically manufacture net shape ceramic, metal, and ceramic matrix composite components to engineering specifications.  Unfortunately, process modeling software, which is readily available for injection-molded plastic material, is not available for ceramic or metal materials.  During this Phase I project, Lone Peak Engineering (LPE), a commercial injection -molding manufacturer, proposes to develop and test process modeling software for powder injection molding of ceramic and metals.",

        "abstract": "Flyer plate boosters are a very efficient device for detonating warheads filled with insensitive explosives.  The devices produce a prompt detonation wave in the main fill explosive which may continue to propagate or it may fail due to comer turning effects. Calculation of detonation propagation or failure is an essential part of flyer plate booster design.  In order to calculate detonation failure, the reaction zone of the detonation wave needs to be resolved.  This is impractical in conventional hydrocodes because the entire explosive must have the same fine grid as the reaction zone. Available reactive flow hydrocodes use bum models that consist of simple global kinetics that are calibrated by experiments performed at pressure that are much lower that found in detonation failure.  A means for calibrating an explosive bum law at high pressure is required and it must be consistent with the current engineering practice. We propose an adaptive Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) hydrocode, that is, the particles are divided and recombined in response to local flow conditions.  In this way the fine numerical resolution can be confined to the detonation reaction zone. We also propose to calibrate the bum rate at high pressure using experimental measurements of detonation wave velocity as a function of wave front curvature.  The bum rate model at low pressure can be calibrated in conventional ways, such as with wedge test experiments.",

        "abstract": "This Phase I project proposes an investigation involving molten salt systems as novel electrolytes for use in electrochemical machining (ECM). As the air-breathing propulsion materials (such as titanium and nickel aluminides) used in Navy aircraft jet engines are becoming harder and more brittle, they are more difficult to machine using conventional methods. ECM is believed to be a feasible method to solve these problems since it is a relatively nontraditional fabrication technique based on controlled removal of material by electrochemical dissolution of the work piece. In ECM, the metal removal rate is independent of the relative hardness of the part of the tool. Electrolytes currently in use include aqueous solutions of salts or strong alkali hydroxides which have a number of disadvantages, such as, low conductivities, corrosion, gassing, and bubbling problems. In this work, it is proposed to apply molten salts, e.g., mixed alkali hydroxide melts, as advanced electrolytes for ECM systems so as to improve their functionalities in coping with the ever-increasing use of new super alloys. Feasible molten salt systems and their physical and electrochemical properties will be identified and compared. The novel ECM technique will be demonstrated using selected electrolytes on a specified aircraft gas turbine material.",

        "abstract": "The Department of Defense has undertaken an ambitious environmental restoration program at thousands of facilities in the U.S.  Many of these facilities have been contaminated by the discharge of dissolved heavy metals.  Often these contaminants migrate into the ground water where they pose a serious threat to aquatic systems and to human health.  The remediation of soils and ground water is usually accomplished by first pumping the contaminated water to the surface.  A number of methods are available to remove heavy metals from water including precipitation, membrane separation, ion exchange or adsorption.  Each of these processes have limitations and it is expensive to treat the large volumes of water that are brought to the surface.  The proposed project concerns the development of a new electrochemical metals recovery process for the treatment of contaminated ground water and waste water.   The process has the potential to be applied below the surface in an extraction well, thereby eliminating the need tobring the contaminated water to the surface.  In Phase I, a bench scale system will be evalulated using simulated ground water spiked with heavy metals.  This will provide the technical foundation for conducting a pilot-scale field demonstration in Phase II.  Anticipated Benefits:  The anticipated result of this project is the development of a versatile process for the separation and recovery of metals from waste water and industrial process streams.  The method will be used for the restoration of contaminated soils and ground water.  The process has a wide range of industrial uses, for example, in metal plating and finishing, ore processing and mining, and in the manufacture of photographic films, jewelry and printed circuit boards.  The process can be applied for the removal of toxic metallic wastes from military and private sector sites.",

In contrast to the above processes operated at high  temperatures, the proposed electrochemical codeposition of inert  particles in a metallic matrix can be carried out below 60 degrees  C.  Because electroplating is very suitable method to produce metal  coatings, electrochemical codeposition is a good alternative in the  field of composite coatings.

        "abstract": "A novel low-temperature technology for treatment of dilute gaseous effluents contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) is needed. Existing and emerging technologies are based on various combinations of thermal, photothermal and catalytic processes in oxidative or reductive environments.  They suffer from emission of toxic substances, employment of inadequate UV light sources, presence of catalysts and disposal/liability problems.  These drawbacks render these processes complex and expensive.  This Phase I proposal offers a novel low-temperature technology designated Excimer Photo-Oxidation (EXPO) for treatment of dilute gaseous effluents contaminated with chlorocarbons and chlorofluorocarbons.  The most innovative aspect of the EXPO technology is the employment of a unique, recently developed very powerful Excimer UV lamp (not laser).  Excimer lamps combine selective and intensive UV radiation, which until now, only Excimer lasers could provide, with the relative simplicity and affordability of conventional UV lamps.  This intense UV emission selectively initiates dissociation of targeted molecules, enhancing chemcial reactivity and leading to effective oxidation at or near ambient temperature.  The end products are inorganic acids (HR, HCl) and environmentally benign products CO2, H2O.  The primary objective of Phase I is to experimentally and computationally demonstrate feasibility.  To achieve this goal, a four-task work plan is proposed.  It consists of (1) design and contruction of two (2) photochemical reactors: (static with Excimer laser, flow with Excimer lamp); (2) experimental investigation; (3) chemical modeling; and (4) cost analysis. Successful completion of Phase I will determine the optimal operating conditions for a pilot-scale prototype, and will provide a technical foundation for a comprehensive Phase II R&D leading to a field demonstration followed by commercialization in Phase III.",

        "abstract": "Globally, over four billion gallons of spent lubricants are   generated annually.  Although spent lubricants can be considered a   valuable renewable resource, less than 10% of the worldwide supply   is actually re-refined into high quality lubricant basestocks.  The   remainder is typically burned as fuel or disposed of using even   less environmentally friendly methods.  Although stricter   environmental regulation will continue to limit these disposal   options, increasing the amount of re-refined lubricants beyond   current worldwide levels will be difficult to achieve without   incurring significant cost.  The disadvantages of conventional   re-refining technologies combine to simply render this technology   useless outside of highly populated metropolitan areas where large   quantities of spent lubricants are generated in a centralized   location.  Re-refining technology that can be employed on a small   scale is required throughout most of the US but up until now has   simply been unavailable.  In response to the inadequacies of   conventional solutions, Media and Process Technology, Inc. (M&P)   has developed the LubriClear Process, an innovative technology that   combines several M&P proprietary technologies into a hybrid   recycling/re-refining process to deliver high quality base oils   from spent lubricants at low cost in an environmentally benign   manner.  All of the barriers associated with widespread application   of conventional distillation based technology are overcome.  In   this Phase I effort, we propose to establish the re-refinability   and possible recyclability of spent lubricants generated by the Air   Force using M&P technology.",

Passivation by use of a thin layer of another metal as a  top coat may also desensitize the metal without altering its  combustion and ignition properties.",

Determination of the correct number of elements N and their positional arrangement s by analytical and computational means with suitable modeling is main trust of the PHase research.

Chemical warfare agents and natural infectious bacteria can render water unusable unless filtered and/or disinfected, and high salinity cannot be tolerated by humans.  Mainstream proposes to test the feasibility of ultrafiltration (UF)/nanofiltration (NF) surfactant-enhanced ion rejection for compact desalination.  The advantages of UF/NF over heavily researched RO systems is operating pressure, which translates to reduced size and weight.  Above the critical micelle concentration of surfactants, charged aggregates form in solution and at the membrane surface to bind/reject opposite charged species.  Process have only been demonstrated with UF for a limited number of anions and cations with up to 99% rejection, but the technology has yet to be considered or applied to desalination. The surfactant-facilitated process has the potential for removal of heavy metal ions and also organic impurities by the same mechanism. Like RO, UF and NF will also disinfect the water stream since the molecular weight cutoff is still below that of bacteria and most endotoxins and pyrogens.  The Phase I effort will culmiate in a proof-of-concept feasibility demonstratio of a 1-liter water purification system.",

In addition, the long-term success of the current design is limited by the absence of an implementation within supported commercial tools.  MaK proposes to integrate the dynamic environment technology developed under the DTO project into its commercial DIS products.  The VR-Link DIS Toolkit will support the exchange of dynamic environment data using the current DIS mechanism or HLA, and the Mak Stealth will be able to graphically depict terrain changes.  In addition, we will develop a prototype for dynamic Terrain Information Generator (DIG) capable of rapidly mapping real-world data into DIS environment.

Establishing this level of cost in a MMW antenna configuration with 10,000 g capability will be emphasized in this effort.

Another advantage of the proposed adsorbent is the pelletizability of fullerene powders without binder, which will provide proper mechanical strength, porosity, and dimension of the adsorbent for PSA air separation applications.  Therefore, the proposed adsorbent will overcome two limitations of the traditional air separation adsorbents, the limited separation factor and non-pelletizability without binder.  During the Phase I program, the feasibility of using fullerene-based adsorbents for air separation will be determined, i.e., the oxygen/nitrogen separation factor of the adsorbent at pressure and temperature ranges suitable for PSA operations will be measured; the process to make pelletized adsorbent will be optimized; the air separtation performance of the adsorbent will be tested using a bench scale PSA unit, and the performance will be compared with that of traditional air separation adsorbent.",

While Si3N4 valves have been successful from a product standpoint, engineers are somewhat uncomfortable using a machine that fails in catastrophic fracture mode.  TiAl valves by contrast exhibit higher temperature capability than conventional Ti alloys and higher fracture toughness than Si3N4.  However, TiAl has limited creep, fatigue and wear resistance, requiring protective coatings in certain areas. The objective of this Phase I program is to develop TiAl-Si3N4 composite, valves using a novel processing route that will result in net-shaped, low density, high performance, high reliability components at a cost much lower than the conventional approaches.

        "abstract": "Ceramic armor is increasingly gaining acceptance as the armor material of choise for defense applications.  One way to increase the ballistic performance of ceramic armors is to enhance their fracture resistance br decreasing their gain size (i.e. decreased flaw size) within the microstructure.  Nanocrystalline powders, by virtue of their nanometer scale partical size, offer excellent potential to enhance the ballistic performance of ceramic armors. Simultaneously, the use of such powders can also result in lower hot-pressing temperatures, aided by the tremendous driving force for densification; lower densification temperatures will be conducive to obtaining smaller grain sizes within  the densified microstructure.  Additionally, such  powders also offer excellent potential of being pressureless-sintered into net-shape bodies. This Phase I program will demonstrate feasibility of synthesizing nanocrystalline powders of SiC, B4C and TiB2 at a low cost, their densification at lower processing temperatures (compared to commercila ceramic powders) without significant grain growth, and the resultant enhancement in fracture resistance under quasistatic loading.",

This project will develop a processing technology for active magnetic refrigeration devices which are being considered as candidates for replacements.  Brittle intermetallics will be processed into a \"tubular channels in solid block\" geometry.  Because the synthesis of such composites is extremely difficult, given their brittle nature, the conventional approach is to use a bed of intermetallic powders. However, numerical calculations indicate that alternate bed geometries, such as a solid block consisting of ~50-60 \u00bfm diameter channels or a series of stacked porous plates, hold promise for a 25% enhancement in operating efficiency. In this new approach, individual fibers are coated with the intermetallic and densified. The thickness of the matrix coating on individual fibers affords a convenient means to control the matrix volume fraction, and hence the porosity in the composite.  Then, the fibers are removed to yield continuous channels of constant pore size throughout a solid block. Alternately, the solid blocks can be sliced into thin porous plates which can be stacked appropriately for the highest efficiency.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  Magnetic refrigeration systems have been proposed for several applications from production of superfluid helium to comfort air conditioning.  Other applications include refrigerators for cooling high temperature superconductor devices such as magnetic energy systems, motors, generators, etc. and one-ton per day high efficiency hydrogen liquefier.",

Analytical tools were used very successfully during the design optimization of the original metallic structure, and the need for design analyses specific to the properties, behavior and failure modes of composite material concepts has been recognized.  However, the development of such tools has lagged behind their need.  The objective of this program is to develop an integrated design tool for composite structures under blast conditions, and to apply it to develop lightweight concepts for the CPK application.

However, the introduction of a new material in an airframe or missile structure is  associated with a heavy cost burden.  As a result, increased emphasis must be  placed on low cost weapon systems.  This requires that cost and performance trade-  offs associated with the selection of candidate composite materials systems  (mature, development, and future) be identified as early as possible.  In recent years much emphasis has been placed on the development of cost models  for composite structures.  However, these models typically provide little insight  into the performance trade-offs associated with alternate materials and process  selections.  The innovation addressed by this Phase I research program will be to  link material property models, with structural analysis and optimization codes for  simultaneous performance and cost modeling of composite structures.  In doing so  the model will allow the cost implications of materials selections and process  improvements to be determined during the earliest stages of the design process,  and before full production is initiated.",

There is currently no effective approach to fabricate large area, high quality, compliant SiC substrates of the required thickness and low defect concentrations(>l000 cm2).  Current techniques result in relatively low quality films and are limited by the minimum attainable Si thickness or limited to small areas. M&T will extend its proprietary growth and fabrication technologies to develop a process by which a thin film (>10 nm) can be deposited onto a silicon oxide underlayer (few hundred nm). M&T's process involves the growth of its single-crystal beta-SiC of the desired thickness and its transfer onto the oxide/Si substrate. The interface between the transferred film and its underlying oxide is sharp and stable. This process is expected to provide a cost-effective approach to the mass fabrication of SICOI substrates, in turn enabling the development of new materials and devices. Subsequent Phase II and III efforts will further develop the process and bring it into full manufacturability.",

The bipropellant fuel combustion temperatures are between 3000 \"approx\" 3500 C.  The conventional thrusters and exit nozzles made of niobium alloys have a maximum operating temperature limit of 1600 C.  A regenerative cooling technology is normally used to keep the wall temperatures below its limit.  This type of cooling is not effective for smaller engines because of the lower propellant flow rate and great wall area/flow rate ratio.  The state-of-the-art propulsion systems made of rhenium coated with iridium permit wall temperatures to be as high as 2200 C.  Unfortunately, Re-Ir components are heavy and expensive.  In this SBIR research program, MMI proposes to develop a lightweight high temperature material, (Hf,Ta)C, through a novel approach. The precursor to (Hf,Ta)C is in a liquid form, which is potentially capable of infiltrating reinforcement materials such as graphite fibers to form composites.  The resulting (Hf,Ta)C phase will be nano-crystalline, which will have improved toughness/ductility. In Phase I, efforts will be focused on materials synthesis and consolidation.

It is lightweight and wear resistant. It also has excellent corrosion resistance and outstanding load bearing characteristics at elevated temperatures.  Its hardness is only surpassed by diamond, CBN and boron carbide.  As a result, SiC becomes a very attractive material in mirror optics applications. Commercially available SiC mirrors and substrates are produced either by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or hot pressing technique. Although CVD SiC gives high optical performance, the primary limitation has been the unavailability of large monolithic pieces. In addition, CVD SiC mirrors are very expensive. The hot pressed SiC are relatively cheap, but it suffers from the problem of residual porosity which hinders its optical performance. In this Phase I SBIR program, MMI proposes to synthesize a high quality ultrafine SiC powder, with good sinterability, through a synergistic approach combining sol-gel technology and carbothermal reduction process. The SiC powder will be consolidated to full density by a UHPC system and the compact will then be polished to optical finish with surface roughness of less than 1 nm.",

The reliability of electronic components is, therefore, increasingly dependent on the ability to transfer heat.

The disadvantages of current methods of fabrication of thermal management materials like W-Cu and Mo-Cu include segregation of copper - lakes and pools of copper in the matrix, primarily caused by blending inhomogeneity. This Phase I effort will be directed towards engineering of high thermal conductivity nanocomposites which will be compatible with the electronic semiconductor materials in terms of CTE's (5-9 ppm/xC). Sono-gel processing will be used to coat nanopowders of graphite and molybdenum with copper to improve bending homogeneity and result in dispersion of copper at the submicron level. The coated nanopowders will be consolidated into bulk materials (through Ultra-High Pressure Sintering allowing minimal grain growth, limiting porosity and resulting in better mechanical properties, high thermal conductivity and predictable CTE's.

Structures using  composite materials essentially rely on the integrity of adhesive bonds  for their structural stability.

A nondestructive inspection (NDI) approach  using the acousto-ultrasonic method promises several unique features  for detecting the loss of adhesion in composite materials.  However, the  NDT industry has not yet evolved a commercial unit to exploit the  exclusive advantages of acousto-ultrasonics in testing composite  laminates.  The proposed Phase I developmental effort will examine the  suitability of the technique, for the detection of the loss of  adhesion, in composite structures and will evolve methodology suitable  for testing composites.  The effort will focus on the computation of  propagation of different modes of sound that will commonly be  encountered in composite structures, both with and without defects, and  will compare with the measured acousto-ultrasonic signals on such  structures.

To date, CuInSe2 (CIS) based solar modules have the highest demonstrated efficiencies of any thin film photovoltaic material.  All known deposition methods for CIS based materials use physical vapor deposition (PVD) at very high temperatures. MRG proposes a novel deposition method for CIS in which deposition temperatures are below 100 C. In this project, the chemical bath deposition (CBD) technique will be developed for the growth of CuInSe2 thin films on flexible substrates. CBD allows the growth of highly conformal, pinhole-free films, allowing the use of thinner (0.5 micron) CIS films than required when using PVD techniques (1-2 micron). Thinner films decrease indium usage, resulting in significant cost savings. This project will examine the growth of CIS films on molybdenum coated, flexible plastic substrates using CBD. A range of deposition conditions and various post-deposition heat treatments will be examined to determine the best method(s) for obtaining device quality film properties. Fabrication of complete solar cells will use CBD of CdS and sputtering of a conductive ZnO window layer on to the CIS film. The proposed research will result in a significant improvement in the power to weight ratio of solar modules. Combined with the ability to roll up the module for storage, this will provide a major advancement in non-nuclear space power generation.",

        "abstract": "Currnet Ni-based metallic turbine shrouds, coated with ceramic abradable materials, are limited to temperatures not exceeding 2,100 F.  Integrated High Performance Turbine Engine Technology (IHPTET) demands gas turbine hot sections with operational temperatures up to 2,500 F (1,370 C).  Ceramic fiber reinforced ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) such as SiC/RBSN are candidate materials for these high temperature turbine shroud applications. However, slight rub of the shrouds with rotor blades can cause fiber damage/breakage leading to a premature component failure.  An abradable coating on the CMC shroud will wliminate this problem and miantain the integrity of both the stationary and rotating parts. We propose three candidate coating materials/systems for evaluation as abradable seals.  All three coating materials have low densities, high temperature capability, good oxidation resistance, and thermal expansion match to the SiC/RBSN substrate material. Low pressure plasma spraying (LPPS) will be used to deposit these coatings on the CMC substrates.  LPPS is a proven, cost-effective technology extensively employed in the turbine industry.  Compared with conventional air plams spray, LPPS offers the advantages of large plasma volume, no contamination and high particle velocities. As a result, the substrate material, placed at relatively larger spray distances,  will not degrade thermally during the plasma spray deposition, and the coatings will have strong adhesion to the CMC substrate.  With a careful control of the porosity, composition and themicrostructure, these coatings are expected to havce excellent abradability and good thermal shock resistance and thus meet the atated performance goals.",

Their simplicity and ruggedness recommend pulse tubes over older technologies in a variety of military and civilian applications. In addition, since they have no moving parts in the cold head, pulse tube cryocoolers cause little or no vibration. That attribute is particularly important in computer chip manufacture, particularly as ever-smaller components make the chip-making process increasingly sensitive to vibration. A series of innovative improvements (the orifice, various bypass arrangements) have brought pulse tube performance into the range of Stirlings and Gifford-McMahon machines. Further improvement is possible. This proposal is for an innovative method of controlling flow and phasing flow in a pulse tube crycooler to enhance heat transfer and thus increase cooling power.  There are strong experimental indications that this novel approach will substantially improve pulse tube performance.",

The objective composites will feature Poly-X(TM) resins in combination with only about 30% (by weight) of short glass, carbon, and/or aramid fibers.  The resulting sheet stock is expected to be useful for further fabrication into parts via various manual or automated thermoforming techniques (e.g. bending or deep-drawing).  Maxdem projects that such Poly-X(TM) composites will exhibit the mechanical properties of conventional two-dimensional long-fiber reinforced composites but at only a fraction of the price, thereby promoting insertion into a variety of products.  The primary Phase I objectives are to verify the key properties of the Poly-X(TM) resins which will translate into realization of the new composites.

During the initial heat up, radiant and convective heat is provided externally to the stack from an enclosure furnace and by sensible heat in the manifold regions of the stack via the process gases. Because both of these techniques involve external heating of the stack, the manifold regions melt while the active area is still a solid and sealing problems have resulted.  In Phase I, a novel electrolyte configuration will be evaluated which will improve the sealing of the fuel cell stack during initial heat up and conditioning. The feasibility of altering the electrolyte composition to obtain melting in the active area prior to melting of the seals will be demonstrated.

When design is complete, a cost analysis of a proposed production version will be conducted. The unit will be capable of the following: Delivering 0.5 lbm/sec of jet fuel against a back pressure of 100 psia and providing 1 hp of hydraulic power at turbine inlet conditions of 1200 oF/20 psia and 1 psia exit pressure. Delivering 10.0 lbm/sec jet fuel against a back pressure of 500 psia and providing 5 hp of hydraulic power at turbine-inlet conditions of 1200 oF/100 psia and 14.7 psia exit pressure. The Phase I program will be subdivided as follows: 1.  Initial establishment of system requirements. 2.  Thermodynamic analysis of the required system. 3.  Feasibility study and survey of off-the-shelf commercially- available components. 4.  Detailed thermodynamic performance study of the system using models of selected components. 5.  System cost analysis to ensure cost objectives are met. 6.  Detailed design of system components. 7.  Creation of a Phase II program plan for fabrication and test of two test units.",

To meet this need,   a 300  MW,  3  GHz  relativistic klystron amplifier, capable of operating with a pulse width of 3.0 microseconds at a pulse rate frequency of 50 Hz, will be developed.    Previously,  the major components of this klystron were analyzed, designed, and simulated. Because more than 1000 of these klystrons will be required for the next linear collider,  the manufacturing time and cost of these amplifiers must be reduced.    This project will generate a conservative, simplistic mechanical design that will emphasize high thermal capacity long life and robust construction.    Phase I  will complete the mechanical design of individual components, subassemblies, and final assembly with a detailed cost analysis.    Phase II will complete the development and testing of the high power klystron.  \n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:   Anticipated results are the successful development of a 300 MW S-band klystron for large linear colliders.

Various acoustic sensing techniques that have been researched but never applied to such a structure will be investigated.  The problem of using acoustic measurement techniques is that most of the data expected from an ALTAIR or similar system is of sporadic and nonsteady state which makes the interpretation of the data difficult.  Recent developments in wavelet and time-frequency algorithms will be considered as a potential solution for deriving useful data from the short-interval bursts of data the antenna produces as it tracks targets in space. Where data intervals are long enough, standard FFT analyses will be used.  In determiing an effective diagnostic system, reasonable installation and maintenance costs will be emphasized, and disruption to the ALTAIR facility during installation will be minimized.  The microphone approach, to which ALTAIR appears to be well suited, will be investigated and compared to the more traditional approach of installed sensors and cabling.",

Using HTS optical switches to change the characteristics of an electrically small antenna element and its associated matching network, the antenna will be capable of being instantly reconfigured to support slow hopping or other narrowband (legacy) waveforms with high radiation efficiency.

Membrane separation offers promise; however, most of the membrane plants installed for this application have been based on cellulose acetate membranes, which have a carbon dioxide/methane selectivity of 20.  If membranes could be made with selectivities of 40 or more, membrane separation would be a far more competitive carbon dioxide separation technique.  While a number of designer polymers have been produced with selectivities in this range, they have not been incorporated into useful membrane systems because the materials are too costly and it is difficult to form these polymers into very thin but robust membranes.  This project will develop improved membranes by chemically modifying the surface layer of an existing membrane which already has a very high carbon dioxide pressure-normalized flux and a fair carbon dioxide/methane selectivity of 15.  The target performance is a membrane with a selectivity of 40, while maintaining an acceptable pressure-normalized flux.  Phase I will evaluate the feasibility of the surface-treatment approach.  Phase II will optimize the process and produce prototype modules.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee: The new membrane modules would make membranes far more competitive with amine absorbers and other conventional technology in the natural gas processing industry.

This is a problem because no accepted treatment technology has been developed.  This project will develop a membrane pervaporation process that is able to achieve essentially 100% emissions control.  The process produces no secondary hazardous waste streams.  Emissions are converted to a methane-containing gas stream that is sent to the boiler fuel line, a BTEX liquid stream that is collected for credit, and water containing less than 1 part per million of BTEX that is discharged.  The system will be low-cost, compact, and lightweight; the value of the recovered BTEX will completely offset the operating and capital costs.  In the Phase I project, the technical and economic feasibility of the process will be demonstrated by a parametric test program using model feed streams in an existing pilot system modified to operate on glycol regeneration off-gas condensate.  In Phase II, field tests of the technology will be performed at a cooperating natural gas processing plant using a proof-of-concept demonstration system.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  Treatment technology for glycol dehydration emissions is needed urgently; the proposed pervaporation process has the potential to fill this need rapidly.  An immediate market for 1,000 systems of the type proposed has been estimated.  A larger market may develop as the technology matures.",

One technology with significant potential uses liquid membranes, which can selectively extract uranium and enrich it 10,000-fold or more by a coupled transport mechanism.  In principle, liquid membranes provide an ideal method for recovery of metals from aqueous wastes because three processes - selective extraction, stripping, and regeneration - are combined in a single step.  Unfortunately, current liquid membranes are not stable due to loss of carrier.  In this project, the resolution of this instability problem by a novel membrane improvement will be evaluated.  In Phase I, the feasibility of the approach will be determined in experiments with flatsheet membrane; long-term stability tests will be conducted.  In Phase II, a pilot-scale demonstration system will be built and tested, first in the laboratory and later at a suitable DOE field site.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Stable liquid membranes will allow effective and economical remediation of groundwaters containing radionuclides.  The improved membranes can also be applied to the separation of other metal ions from aqueous streams in numerous industrial operations.",

Unlike human image analysts who can quickly process only (relative) amplitude images, ATR systems have the potential to use physical models and other forms of target reference data to process additional types of collected and processed data.  Additional data types include absolute amplitude images, polarimetric images, multi-kernel images, symbolic feature segmentations, and prior models of the scene including multilook data.  The desirability of using such data types has been widely acknowledged, but techniques have not advanced enough to be suitable for incorporation into development programs headed for near-term deployment.  The proposed effort will develop a flexible Multi-Dimensional Automatic Target Recognition (MDATR) system for Bayesian modeling and associated ATR, populate the system's model and algorithm databases to work with multiple types of SAR-derived data, and test the resulting system performance.",

Rapid advances in computers, printers, scanners, and copiers have made it increasingly simple to reproduce security emblems traditionally used for verification and authentication. Even holograms, once considered impenetrable, are now routinely counterfeited using techniques such as contact copying.  To circumvent the effectiveness of intensity sensitive devices to copy traditional security emblems, the use of complex phase patterns has been proposed.  An ID card is produced by bonding a phase mask to some primary identification pattern such as a fingerprint.  A nonlinear joint transform correlator is then used to match the ID card to an identical phase mask that is part of an automated reader.  Such a phase encoded ID card could, however, be copied using interferometric techniques.  To avoid this, we propose the use of an innovative holographic techniques, developed at MetroLaser, to create an ID card that is an inseparable combination of the phase mask and another complex wave front, unknown to a potential counterfeiter.  The two patterns on the card are deconvolved using a \"Key\" hologram that is of the part reader, resulting in a nearly ideal security system.",

The operation characteristics of the laser diode and the system configuration are selected to maximize accuracy and to avoid artifacts from sub-surface reflections.

        "abstract": "The rapid heating of a solid surface due to interaction with a high energy laser beam can lead to vaporization and ionization that generates a plasma plume above the surface.  Such plasmas are key elements in material processing techniques such as etching and thin film deposition.  Both the process control and the fundamental understanding of these plasmas require diagnostic measurements of various plasma parameters including the concentration of atomic species.  For example, during plasma -assisted thin-film deposition the local concentration of atomic species determines the quality of the films deposited.  Atomic species concentration can often be high enough to make the plasma optically thick.  In such environments, standard diagnostic techniques such as laser-induced fluorescence do not work well.  We propose the application of amplified spontaneous emission (ASE)  as a diagnostic probe of dense plasmas for the measurement of atomic species concentrations.  This technique is applicable in optically dense media and requires only limited optical access.  The Phase I effort will result in the development of a diagnostic probe for atomic species concentrations using ASE this probe will be applicable to both government and industrial facilities which generate laser-induced plasma plumes.",

Baxter Helathcare has invested in MDS and will co-develop, manufacture, and distribute tools for the MDS dexterity enhancement systems.  MDS is working with GE Medical Systems to develop a system based on MDS concepts for non-ferromagnetic positioning, tool actuation, as well as position and force sensing.  New technologies to be developed with SBIR funding include optimistic computing to reduce latency, parallel kinematic high bandwidth hand interface, parallel kinematic hydraulic manipulator, and all optical position and force sensing with spatial domain multiplexing.

The proposed project will reassess the economics and practicability of using high-power microwave radiation as an alternative means to control insects in stored-products.  Preliminary experiments at a frequency of 10.6 GHz on Sitophilus zeamais in wheat and Tribolium castaneum in flour indicate that the selective heating of those insects increases at frequencies above 2.45 GHz and does not decrease monotonically as previously believed.  This implies that hitherto unobserved loss phenomena exist in insects and that high mortality can be induced economically at the higher microwave frequencies.  The proposed effort will extend the range of the previous experiments to confirm that a predicted optimum frequency exists in the microwave band and identify an optimum operating frequency within the constraints of CFR 47 (Part 2).  These goals will be met by performing high-power tests at selected frequencies up to 58 GHz and statistically verifying relative effectiveness in producing insect mortality.  Grain viability and quality of the treated product will also be determined.",

        "abstract": "Many of the solid-state chemical microsensors, including surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices and the organic or inorganic semiconductors, are ideally suited as sensors for on-chip chemical analysis systems as they are inherently very small, low power and readily manufactured by photolithographic techniques.  The major technical problems associated with the development of integrated chemical microsensor systems based on these devices is the lack of sufficiently sensitive and selective coating materials for the devices and the means to apply the coatings uniformly and reproductively to very specific, highly localized sites on a substrate surface.  The approach to solving these technological issues will be based on the exciting new materials processing technique of Pulsed Lase Deposition (PLD).  A unique advantage of PLD is that plumes of charged particles of coating material ablated by an excimer laser can be precisely focused on specific target locations and the amount deposited can be closely controlled.  Another advantage of PLD is that many highly sorptive and selective materials that can not be applied by standard surface techniques, can be deposited by PLD.  These include such materials as molecular sieves, high surface area carbons and certain organic polymers (flouorocarbons) that can not be easily dissolved or suspended in solvents.  Phase I will focus on using PLD to prepare coatings of these new candidate materials and then performance as coatings on SAW devices.  Pertinent characterization will include chemical sensitivity, selectivity, and reproducibility.",

In distinct contrast to the existing full-scale EM simulation tools commercially available, which in principle can also perform the similar task, JUGGERNAUT will use a significantly fast algorithm (a hybrid numerical-analytical technique) developed by us specifically optimized for printed antenna elements.  This would allow fast design iterations of complex printed geometries, which otherwise difficult or impossible to achieve using the common full-scale EM simulation tools.  Further, instead of modeling a large integrated structure by a full-scale EM simulation tool, which unnecessarily takes large computation time, JUGGERNAUT will use an efficient circuit-EM based simulation approach.  In this approach, the large integrated structure will be intelligently decomposed into smaller elements, which will be separately modeled using EM methods optimized for the specific type of element.  The element results are finally connected together via simple circuit principles in order to obtain the characteristics of the total structure.  Other important features of JUGGERNAUT will include a versatile, user-friendly graphical interface, the simulation of isolated elements as well as infinite periodic arrays, accurate modeling of the dielectric, metal as well as surface-wave loses using a fast technique, modeling of plane-wave scattering characteristics of the antenna for radar cross-section studies, among many others.",

A transverse magnetic field produces a \"wiggled\" beam which is then collimated and bunched at twice the drive frequency. These bunches are next passed through an electron-gain section (MTI dynode) composed of a very thin foil (\"approx\" 3um) of a high secondary electron yield material (such as diamond). The foil operates in the transmission mode and is designed to provide an electron gain of \"approx\" 50. The high-current bunches are accelerated and injected into an output cavity that operates in a TM010 mode at a frequency that is twice the drive frequency.  Phase I is aimed at detailed analysis and 3-dimensional particle-in-cell studies to establish credible estimates of output power, efficiency, gain, and other key parameters leading to the construction of an operating device under Phase II.",

During the development process precision differential capacitive position sensors, with excellent stability and noise characteristics, have been designed.  The electronic circuitry developed to optimize these characteristics use precision differential current transformers.  However miniaturized transformers with the desired size and electrical characteristics are not available at the present time. We propose to design transformers manufactured by the millimachining technology used in the development of the precision inertial instruments.  The miniature precision differential current transformers would be fabricated using batch processing techniques and would be capable of being integrated with the differential capacitors position sensors internal to the inertial instruments.  The result would be an optimization of the performance as well as the size and reliability of the Inertial Instruments.",

        "abstract": "Bearing supported rotating elements (or wheels) are widely used in modern technology, in particular, in BMDO applications using devices such as gyroscopes and reaction/momentum wheels for measurement and control of booster and interceptor flight path and satellite orientation, and in widely used commercial items such as data storage disk drives.  Ball bearings and gas bearings currently used for such applications have problems limiting performance and reliability.  Magnetic bearings have the potential to provide much improved characteristics.  In a NASA sponsored Phase I SBIR, Milli Sensor Systems & Actuators, Inc., developed and applied for a patent on a unique magnetic actuator concept that should make possible affordable, small and reliable magnetically supported rotating wheels that, because they can be fabricated using planar technologies, should be affordable and reliable.  While that work established the basic feasibility of the approach, a number of significant issues remain to be satisfactorily addressed before a proof of concept fabrication program can confidently proceed.  The proposed work addresses each of these issues in turn and successful completion should result in magnetic actuator and drive motor designs that can provide the required functionality at low cost and with high reliability.",

Several application opportunities are listed below.  An analysis is application-oriented requirements leads to the definition of camera capabilities described in terms of the field of view, minimum number of scene pixels, radiometer sensitivity, and frame time requirements.  Current state-of-the-art radiometric sensitivity, at the frequency of interest, exceeds that required to sample all of the scene pixels with one receiver in less than one second.  If one were able to raster scan a single receiver antenna beam over all of the scene pixels in one second, the one second camera would need only one receiver.  Present-day electronic, as well as mechanical antenna beam scanning capabilities fail to meet the required scanning rate for a single channel PMMW camera system.  We propose to modify a commercially-available, high-speed, mechanically scanned radar system antenna, and adapt it to the one-second camera.  Additional receiving channels are needed to reduce the scanning rate requirement, not to improve sensitivity.  The addition of receiver channels as a means for reducing mechanical scan rate requirements is not without problems associated with interchannel gain stability and flat field retention.  The proposed effort will provide a solution to these and other problems associated with the use of more than one receiver channel when generating PMMW images.",

        "abstract": "A one watt 94 GHz power amplifier with >2 GHz bandwidth will be designed, and an operational brassboard model fabricated.  The approach is based upon power combining of four single-diode silicon IMPATT amplifier modules using magic-tees.  The brassboard model will serve as a developmental unit during Phase II in which a product development effort will lead to a production version.  Also on Phase II, a 2 watt model will be produced.  Key characteristics for the product are:  1) operationally robust for field operation, 2) high quality spectral characteristics, 3) producible in moderate quantities at an affordable price, 4) ready for production within 1 to 2 years.  Consistent with these guidelines, the technical approach is one of low-to-moderate technical risk.  The project will draw from Millitech's unique and extensive capabilities in this area.  Research issues, which complement the product development effort, are confined to two areas:  1) Refinement of the RF design in the single-diode building block amplifier module to enhance the manufacturability of these modules which typically have required substantial costly, highly skilled labor.  2) Determining the optimum of several candidate topologies for module-level combining.  Refinement of methods for suppression of spurious and broadband noise from the IMPATTs within the production environment will influence the course of these research areas.  Anticipated Benefits:  This project will provide for the long-awaited but yet unfulfilled need for a 1 watt 94 GHz solid state power amplifier which can be obtained as a commercial product.  To date, this power level has not been available except through research lab types of efforts which result in one-of-a-kind, high cost units.  This product will allow realization of numerous advanced millimeter wave applications, especially radar.  System requirements exist in both military and commercial sectors.",

To specify the geometry, the code will use a graphical interface with CAD modeling of the columns, target, and ground.   This CAD input removes the user from the inconveniences associated wiuth geometry inputs, which for complicated geometries are impossible to type in manually.  A library of airframe CAD files has already been developed at Wright Labs and will be used by this code.  To solve for the scattering, a hybrid computation is proposed.  At low frequencies the column can be examined macroscopically by assuming it to be made of a homogeneous material, while at high frequencies it is modeled as a radom collection of individial scatterers.  According to foam manufacturers, these scatterers take the shape of regular polyhedrons.  By analyzing the scattering from individial scatterers, the entire collection can be statistically summed.  Once the electromagnetic solution is obtained, it can be visualized with ray tracing, SAR imaging, time domain, and frequency domain information desplayed on target overlays.  Also, measurements will be made for comparison, at both indoor and outdoor facilities.",

The starting materials may be either devolatilized isotropic petroleum pitch or pitches consisting entirely of polyaromatic mesophase. Powder preparation mimics the approach used in creating homogeneous powders for high strength ceramics, namely, the generation of uniform spheres in solution, followed by separation and drying. By producing ceramic artifacts with dramatic absolute property improvements, and much less scatter in properties, powders derived from solution chemistry have revolutionized ceramic processing. Remarkable recent advances in the sintering of pitch powders demonstrate that carbon artifacts with flexural strengths exceeding 200 MPa (29 ksi) may be achieved using conventionally comminuted powders. The proposed work aims to demonstrate that sintered homogeneous pitch powders offer even greater improvements over crushed precursor in the fabrication of carbon solids. Sample carbon plates will be processed from the homogeneous powders and compared with industry standard UCAR ATJ and POCO AXF-5Q. The thickness of coupon specimens will approximate that of near net shape carbon pistons, the primary intended application.",

        "abstract": "Wheelchair users are severely restricted from participation in outdoor activities due to the inability to traverse rough and sloped terrain.  A novel wheel camber adjustment mechanism for hand powered, all-terrain, wheeled vehicles will be designed and evaluated.  This system addresses the central technical issue in achieving high stability in such vehicles.  The wheel camber adjustment system allows continuous adjustment of vehicle/operator center of gravity to keep it centered over the wheelbase.  Such a design reduces the need for a wide wheel base or a low center of gravity to achieve stability.  The mechanism will be integrated in to a hand-powered vehicle and tested for stability under a wide variety of terrain conditions.  This mechanism will allow construction of a highly stable, hand-powered vehicle that has the narrow wheelbase and high clearance needed to traverse most trails, rocky shores, and forests.",

By detecting WF, RVMD will help prevent disk failures and improve safety for the flying public.  Phase I will show RVMD detects reactive disk resonance modes in a model bladed disk by processing tachometer signals, without using traditional vibration sensors.  It has two objectives; 1) identify 0D, 1D and 0C disk modes, 2) measure mode shifts due to simulated fatigue cracking.  Two commercial engine manufacturers have committed to Phase II.  To date, the original RVM algorithm has been applied successfully in detecting blade and shaft resonances in axial flow compressors, industrial prop fans, and electric power turbines.  Currently, RVM is also being applied to HCF detection in engine fan blades with Air Force support.",

        "abstract": "The innovation presented in this proposal involves the use of a liquid melt thermal spray process for cost effective rapid prototyping of near-net shape tooling for the lay up of advanced composite materials. The process uses a focused beam of charged liquid droplets to form tooling directly from three-dimensional computer generated drawings eliminating traditional steps associated with fabrication of a lay up mold. This process is called \"liquid melt focused beam\" (LMFB) thermal spray. The liquid droplets will be focused using novel methods to enable the liquid plume width to be controlled for fabricating a part from the \"ground\" up. The innovation is especially profound since it has potential for fabrication of both small and large scale tools. The process has commercial applications and the Boeing Defense and Space Group is interested in Phase II development of the process for large scale components. A separate area of importance to the US Air Force is that once the process has been demonstrated for fabrication of tooling, it may also be utilized for the direct fabrication of composite sandwiched materials. The innovative technology described in this proposal meets the subtopic need for tooling techniques for near-net shape production of advanced composites.",

        "abstract": "Current tactical missile rocket nozzles provide adequate performance, but it is expected that significant improvements can be realized if the present generation nozzles are replaced with composite nozzles composed of carbon fibers and hafnium or zirconium-based ceramic matrix materials.  Present development of advanced composite nozzles has focused on costly chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) as the method of fabrication.  An alternate fabrication method based on liquid impregnation and pyrolysis is proposed here as a potentially low- cost replacement or enhancement for CVI.  A survey of appropriate liquid or liquefiable precursors for hafnium and zirconium ceramics showed that the use of relatively inexpensive acetates, chlorides, alkoxides, and colloids has the potential for reducing the cost of the composites.  Processing involves repeated cycles of vacuum impregnation of the liquid precursor into a carbon fiber preform, drying or gelation to form a solid, and pyrolysis at high temperatures in inert gas.  Hybrid processes combining CVI and liquid impregnation and pyrolysis may also be more cost-effective than CVI alone.  A 6 month Phase I program to be performed in three sequential tasks is proposed to prove the feasibility and demonstrate the potential of the liquid impregnation and pyrolysis approach.  In Task I pyrolysis experiments will be conducted to determine the yield, chemical composition, and phase constitution of ceramic products obtained from the various precursors and important precursor mixtures.  A reduced list of precursors selected on the basis of the Task 1 results will be used to fabricate small composite samples by impregnation and pyrolysis in Task 2. The nature of the matrix materials and matrix-fiber characteristics will be evaluated in Task 2 and the most promising precursors will be used to fabricate samples for mechanical testing in Task 3. An optional Task 4 is proposed for the fabrication and matrix-fiber characteristics will be evaluated in Task 2 and the most promising precursors will be used sponsor for evaluation.

The material requirements for the non-eroding fin materials include low  mass density, high strength, good erosion resistance (i.e. hardness at elevated temperatures), good oxidation resistance, high melting temperature, high thermal shock resistance, and chemical incompatibility with the aluminum oxide present in the rocket exhaust.  In multi-material design configurations and for the case of refractory composite materials, low residual stress after processing will contribute to the ability of the designs to achieve high strengths.

        "abstract": "Carbon-carbon (C-C) composites have properties that make them   attractive for increasing the efficiency of a variety of   commercial and industrial combustion systems and   heat-utilization processes. Increased efficiency will lower the   emission of harmful products for direct improvements in   environmental quality.  A major barrier to commercial and   industrial uses of C-C composites is high cost. A rough   analysis performed for this proposal indicates that over 50% of   the cost of some C-C composites is associated with conventional   densification that requires processing at high temperatures in   nonoxidizing environments.  As a result, simplifying and   increasing the efficiency of the densification could result in   as much as a 33% reduction in the final cost of simple   high-production C-C components.  An effective approach for   lowering the densification cost of C-C composites would be to   minimize or tally eliminate the need for nonoxidizing   high-temperature processing.  In this vein, the approach proposed   here is based on impregnating carbon fiber preforms with sugars of   appropriate characteristics and paralyzing these at low   temperatures in air to form the carbon matrix.  Preliminary work   at MSNW has proven that sugar densification by multiple cycles   of melt impregnation and low-temperature pyrolysis in air is   effective to a significant degree.  However, the process is   compromised by foaming of the sugar during pyrolysis.  The   purpose of the proposed program is to identify methods to   suppress foaming and to demonstrate the fabrication of C-C   composites of acceptably high density and tensile strength.  The   proposed 6 month program would be conducted in two sequential 3   month tasks.  Task 1 would be used to evaluate sugar   polymerization and low-temperature pressure pyrolysis as   methods for eliminating or greatly reducing pyrolysis foaming.    C-C composite samples would be fabricated in Task 2 for   characterization and tensile testing.  An optional Task 3 is   proposed in which five 4 in. x 4 in. x 0.125 in. C-C panels would   be fabricated by the preferred method identified in Tasks 1 and 2   for delivery to the sponsor.",

        "abstract": "Silicon carbide fiber reinforced titanium matrix (SiC/Ti) composites offer lightweight, high strength replacement materials for superalloys in gas turbine engines and airframes.  Titanium matrices tend to react with SiC and form reaction products that exhibit properties which are very different from the starting constituents.  This mismatch in properties generates large residual thermal stresses after fabrication and high temperature exposure of the composites.  These stresses can damage the material, resulting in poor strengths and unacceptable thermomechanical fatigue characteristics.  The proposed program seeks to improve the properties of SiC/Ti composites by designing and demonstrating fiber/matrix interphase barrier coatings.  The proposed effort will first employ unique, coupled thermomechanical and micromechanical models to select barrier materials, thicknesses, morphologies, and application methods.  Then to demonstrate the improvements, a minimum of two of the most attractive barrier coating materials will be applied to commercial SiC monofilaments.  Titanium alloy matrix composite compacts will be fabricated using the experimental coated fibers and compared with composites that use state of the art metallized or carbon-coated fibers.  The compacts will be examined before and after thermal exposure to evaluate the reaction products and residual stresses.  The results of the Phase I program will demonstrate two or more specific barrier coatings that improve the composite strength and fatigue behavior.  The project will be performed with the assistance of Pratt & Whitney-Florida.",

        "abstract": "Changing  operational requirements,  especially in littoral warfare, necessitate the use of advanced signal processing algorithms capable of meeting the augmented challenges of detection, classification, and localization of acoustic targets in shallow waters, in a broadband context.  The use of broadband acoustic signal processing requires proper formulation of the physical problem by means of an extended broadband target-medium model\" that incorporates the new phenomenology, e.g., the dispersive time-varying characteristics of the propagation medium (sea) and the distinct effects of reverberation/multipath, clutter, and ambient noise. In the spirit of \"revolutionary innovation\" rather than \"evolutionary extrapolation\", Multispec Corporation proposes a truly innovative approach to broadband passive detection, classification, and localization of targets (i.e., acoustic sources of interest) that meets the emerging challenges with advanced, yet practical, signal processing technologies.  MultiSpec's approach combines the extended target-medium model with advanced high-order signal processing (HOSP) to yield effective algorithms for passive broadband acoustic processing in the mid-frequency range. A variant of this approach is currently funded for the active case.",

These algorithms are able to support airborne surveillance radar systems in a variety of non-Gaussian clutter environments.  MultiSpec's advanced signal processing algorithms based on alpha-stable models hold great promise in this regard, because alpha-stable amplitude statistics were shown to be suitable for characterization of the natural clutter data collected in the DARPA Mountaintop program.  Performance improvements over existing methods will be examined and qualified.  Three tasks are proposed for the Phase I project: (1) statistical characterization of non-Guassian clutter data with emphasis on multivariate alpha-stable models; (2) design and performance assessment of adaptive CFAR detection algorithms based on alphastable models and associated; and (3) design and performance assessment of STAP algorithms for joint estimation of azimuth/Doppler based on covariations.  In all three tasks emphasis will be placed on algorithmic developments that are cost effective in order to assure quick transition to field applications.

Two problems are frequently encountered in the synthesis of nanoparticles: (1) carbide and nitride nanoparticles of reactive elements are invariably contaminated with oxygen, and (2) multicomponent materials are usually non-stoichiometric. Our collaborators at SUNY Buffalo have developed a patented Laser Assisted Molecular Beam Deposition (LAMBD) process, which is capable of solving both problems.  Our goal in this program is to develop a LAMBD nanopowder production module, integrate it into our existing Nanopowder Production System, and thus expand our powder production capabilities. The LAMBD process, which is an unique combination of plasma/laser ablation techniques, gas flow modulations, and molecular beam expansions, has so far been used only for the deposition of high quality films on substrates. In Phase I, we will determine the process parameters affecting nanopowder production, synthesize test quantities of powders, and characterize them. In Phase II, we will incorporate the LAMBD module into our Chemical Vapor Condensation (CVC) production system to demonstrate production of nanopowders of nitrides, carbides, and multicomponent materials in sufficient quantities for our collaborators to use for evaluation purposes. In both Phase I and II, we will focus primarily on synthesis and processing of Aluminum Nitride (AlN), but we will extend the production capabilities, along with marketing and commercialization of powders, in Phase III.",

This type of fiber is expected to have great utility in high speed local area networks.  Existing Japanese production methods result in bandwidths which are three to ten times less than theoretically possible, and the bandwidth of the fiber is not stable and reproducible.  The production rate is intrinsically limited by the batch nature of the process and, or, multi-step procedure.  In the USA, the High-Speed Plastic Network (HSPN) consortium was formed in 1994, and is supported by a $5M DARPA grant.  A member of that team has licensed one of the Japanese batch technologies to fabricate the above type of fiber.  The present proposal is to develop a novel, low cost, continuous production process for the fiber.  The fiber will have a stable bandwidth of > 2 GHz.km, be stable from -40+ C to +150+ C, have low moisture uptake, attenuation of less than 150 dB/kilometer and be stable to radiation exposure up to 10(3) Rad.",

This project will make a novel fiber-optic output phototube light amplifier/compressor appropriate for the photodetector demands of the next generation of high energy experiments.  In the proposed light amplifier, photoelectrons from a photocathode are accelerated onto an aluminized phosphor anode.  The photon-gain output of the phosphor is coupled to an optical fiber, either directly, or through a wavelength shifting fiber.  Thus the photons impinging on the photocathode are \"compressed\" in phase space, and amplified.  Phase I will demonstrate the concept and Phase II will produce a prototype of the device\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  The fiber optic output photomultiplier should find commercial applications in medical diagnostic equipment (PET scanners, CT etc.) and in industrial non-destructive testing (UV, X-rays).  This device can be used in environments of extreme electronic noise, such as large electric motors or transformers, because of the decoupling of the HV power from the optical output.",

These motions are due to the aircraft's forward velocity, vibrations, and other perturbations for which the system is not compensated. The approach utilizes movement of the MFPA assembly at the focal plane based on sensor information received both external to the assembly as well as within the assembly. This data is processed and fed back for appropriate adjustments to the focal plane assembly. The complete system consists of a Position & Motion Detector subassembly, a Detector Drive and Compensation subassembly, a Central Processing Unit and the Focal Plane Array all of which will be operated via a flex cable interface to minimize impact on movements.  Technology applications will address state-of-the-art in gyros (laser & fiber optic) and gyroless motion compensation; accurate position measuring devices such as optical encoders/holographic gratings, interferometric techniques, and non-contact fiber optic displacement sensors, etc; drive mechanisms and low friction bearing surfaces offering a high rate of movement in a low noise environment, and the use of high tech materials; and microscanning image processing techniques, if appropriate, for subpixel processing.

During the Phase I program NEAR will 1) generate detailed design specifications for the pressure sensing system, 2) design and prototype a shape control mechanism capable of generating optimized thickness/camber profiles using a minimum number of actuators, and 3) fabricate an innovative skin for the adaptive foil allowing repeated, high strain cycling without permanent distortion.  The Phase I program will conclude with functional demonstration of the shape control mechanism and skin material integrated into an adaptive foil (without pressure sensing hardware or closed-loop control means).  During the Phase II effort NEAR will develop and wind tunnel test a complete closed-loop, real-time variable geometry foil with an integrated pressure sensing array and the necessary control laws.",

        "abstract": "The use of CFD in the design and analysis of flight vehicles   requires specialized knowledge about factors such as algorithm   options, gridding methods, physical models, and runtime   performance.  This knowledge is needed to properly set up a   calculation and to monitor the solution during execution of the   code.  The objective of this work is to create an intelligent   software environment that will assist CFD users of all ability   levels in setting up and running CFD codes.  A knowledge base of   expert rules and procedures will be incorporated within an   intelligent advisory and monitoring system to meet this objective.   The advisory system will assist users in selecting input parameters   that are consistent with a given CFD code and engineering   situation.  Assistance in the choice of code or detailed   explanatory information will also be provided as needed.  The   monitoring function will implement analytical methods for tracking   the flow solution in order to identify potential problems during   run time.  The goal of this system is to facilitate the CFD   design/analysis yale by minimizing the risks associate with   improper input parameters, assisting in the deary deacon of errors,   reducing the need for labor intensive manual checks during   execution, and improving user training.",

We then focus on thermal decomposition (pyrolysis) as the best  technology to meet the Navy's needs. our investigation efforts will leverage  off ongoing work on pyrolysis of plastics by the American Plastics Council  in conjunction with Conrad Industries, Inc.. We analyze Navy plastic feedstock  input streams and process technology modifications needed to produce a syn-  thetic crude oil, or better, equivalent the Navy can use in a closed-loop  recycling operation. We also analyze the overall concept of operations for  the Navy's shipboard plastics recycling to determine if it is economically  viable for the Navy and/or commercial companies. This includes analyzing  and recommending transportation and handling options for ship and shore to  minimize these costs. During Phase II, we will perform test runs of the  Navy's plastic wastes in the prototype pyroysis unit in Washington to confirm  our Phase I findings.",

        "abstract": "There is a significant market for magnetoresistive sensors as read heads for ultra high density magentic information storage, with potentially large defense and commercial applications.  The recently discovered colossal magentoresistance (CMR) effects in (La, Ca) Mn O3 abd related manganite oxide systems indicate a good potential for such applications.  The maximum magnetoresistance achievable ina the manganite oxides (+50%) is larger compared to that in metallic multilayers (+20%).  The current challenge is to optimize the material composition and microstructure for enhancing the low field magnetoresistance.  There is a need for developing a deposition method for obtaining CMR films with desirable properties on technologically important substrates over large areas with high yields.  Towards this goal, we propose in this Phase I effort, to develop a process technology based on ion beam assisted pulsed laser deposition which incorporates diagnostic tools for monitoring the growth environment.  Using this  method, we will deposit La 1-x (Ca, Sr, Ba)x MnO3 [0.30\u00bfx0.33] films on (i) YSZ / CeO2 buffered (100)Si substrates to obtain epitaxial films and (ii) on Si subtrates with oriented Bi4Ti#O12 structural templates to obtain c-axis oriented CMR films.  The approach yielding promising results will be further optimized for desirable film properties.  Depositions will be carried out on 1-2 inch2 substrates in the Phase I feasibility study and will be scaled to \u00bf4 inch2 in Phase II.   We will explore the potential and establish the techncial feasibility of Optical Emission Spectroscopy and Langmuir electrostatic Ion probes as laser plasma diagnostic and deposition monitor tools for obtaining desirable film properties with high yield on large area Si substrates.",

This research project will develop and demonstrate two novel approaches to compactly packaging high-efficiency small       (40 W) wind turbines.  A horizontal axis wind turbine for relatively strong winds will feature rotor blades which hinge at the hub so they can be folded back for compact storage in transportation.  A vertical axis wind turbine for moderate winds will feature flexible blades which can also be compacted into a small package for transportation.  The principal technical objectives of the Phase I research program are to achieve significant improvement in the efficiency of micro-scale wind turbines, to develop a compact packaging for the small wind turbines, and to demonstrate the suitability of smallwind turbines to provide power for remote data collection devices.  Phase I tasks include designing and testing new airfoils and rotors and designing the electrical systems.",

Currently, the primary source of thermal energy in EAFs is the electric arc (65% of kwh), with additional energy input from oxy-fuel burners (5%), and other exothermic reactions (30%) that are supported by injecting oxygen into the furnace.  Presently, energy input setpoint profiles are developed through trial and error, by simple linear algorithms, or are based on the experience of furnace operators.  This project will develop an intelligent system, based on neural network technology, that optimizes the energy input from each major source, automatically adapting to changing operating conditions.  In Phase I, an EAF will be outfitted with sensors to monitor furnace conditions, energy input, and furnace off-gas emissions so that more accurate neural-network models can be devised.  In Phase II, a working prototype control system will be developed to optimally coordinate energy input from each major source.  \n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee: A 5% improvement in energy efficiency could save the US steel industry $50 million per year.  Other benefits include greater flexibility to energy source availability and reduced emissions.

The problem of detecting and classifying targets in thermal and visual images is complicated by factors such as sensor deficiencies, clutter, target size variations due to range, target aspect angle variations, sun angle and weather conditions.  Moreover, targets may be partially obscured by smoke, dust, camouflage or shadows.  A seeker scene processor must deal with real-time situations having largely unknown backgrounds and weather conditions.

Due to the remoteness and inaccessiblity of many of Alaska's rural contaminated sites, off-site treatment is often impractical.  The remediation option chosen at any site is based on the availability of the area for on-site treatement, time for completion, and money.  Many of Alaska's contaminated sites have an abundance of space and time, making on-site remediation a viable alternative.\n\nThe proposed program is directed at demonstrating the feasibility of using an on-site, remotely-controlled and monitored process to optimize remediation of contaminated soil at inaccessible rural areas.  Environmental parameters are configured to enhance biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons present in contaminated soil.  The remediation process is accomplished through the use of a uniquely designed monitoring and control system.",

        "abstract": "Three new replication techniques will be developed to reduce the costs of manufacturing precision diffractive gratings and optics, binary optics, microoptics and computer generated holograms.  These replication techniques will show their advantages especially when they are non-central symmetric (e.g. aspherics), their aperture areas are not circular (e.g. square or hexagonal), and/or they are in an array format with precise center-to-center spacings.  The first technique can be applied to replicate infrared as well as visible precision optics on environmentally durable substrates.  It requires first generating a gray level mask with only one writing step by controlling the electron dosage spatially .  Then, using this gray level mask, it requires for each copy only one iteration of exposing the analog photoresist and transferring the analog photoresist pattern into the substrate by chemically assisted ion beam etching (CAIBE).  Since multiple substrates can be etched simultaneously, the CAIBE is a batch process and the etching cost for each copy is reduced.  Moreover, since the same gray level mask can be used over and over again for making many copies, the cost of generating the gray level mask will be spread over the number of copies.  The second replication technique starts with using the first technique just described to produce a master on a special metal/alloy material to be specified by Honeywell/Donnelly Optics.  Given the new master they will then produce many precision replicas of plastic optics by injection molding.  The third replication technique starts with a master on glass, replicas are made from liquid photopolymer by molding.  Both the second and third replication techniques are applicable only to visible precision optics. Our technical objectives for Phase I will be evaluation of the feasibility of these replication techniques.  The overall effort will be divided as follows: 60% to the first replication techinique, 15%  to the second and 25% to the third.  Anticipated Military Benefits/Potential Commercial Applications of the Research or Developments:  By developing new replication techniques the cost of manufacturing small precision optics will be lowered, thus eliminating the majo",

The primary obstacles are: high operating temperatures of the current materials, low volumetric efficiency, and poor materials compatibility with the operating environment.  This project will develop a new composite nanostructured ceria electrolyte with higher conductivity at lower operating temperatures.  The approach involves a unique synthesis method for making a novel mixture of oxide ceramic precursors.  The mixture has been selected to give a composite solid electrolyte which: (1) can be operated at lower temperatures, (2) will have higher ionic conductivity resulting in improved volumetric efficiency, and (3) will eliminate electrical conductivity in oxygen depleted atmospheres common to SOFCs.  Phase I will demonstrate the materials synthesis and ceramic fabrication technologies required for exploitation of the concept.  Properties of the novel ceramic electrolytes will be evaluated to determine performance versus theoretical expectations.  In Phase II, the materials synthesis and fabrication technologies will be optimized and scaled up for demonstration in prototype SOFC systems.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee: This project should result in composite ceria electrolytes with superior oxygen transport properties compared to existing materials.  The new materials should replace zirconia-based electrolytes, allowing for lower operating temperature and smaller overall system size.  Large-scale applications include power generation for residential, industrial, and transportation uses.  Other applications for the technology include oxygen generation for home health care, industrial, and military uses.",

To meet this need North Dancer Labs proposes to develop a unique high-speed Erasable Holographic Optical Storage system (E-HOS) capable of recording ~100 or more 2-D images with at least 1K X 1K resolution at a 10kHz repetition rate (or higher) which can then be digitized and archived at standard video rates.  E-HOS will store high resolution images a Fourier holograms in a disk format utilizing an erasable recording material.  Two new materials which will be ideal candidates are Spiropyran-doped polymer and bacteriorhodopsin.  Both of these materials are recently developed, high resolution, erasable holographic recording materials which do not require processing.  The E-HOS system will consist of an innovative high speed holographic optical disk recorder using a pulsed copper vapor laser system capable of delivering up to 30 kHz illumination pulses/sec.  After acquiring the image data to the holographic disk, a high resolution CCD and computer will digitize and store the data at standard video rates.  The disk is then erased and the system is ready to collect another set of images in minutes.  This E-HOS system will provide DoD with the ability to digitally record high speed transient events.  During Phase I, North Dancer Labs will demonstrate the feasibility of developing E-HOS, utilizing an erasable holographic recording material, and establish a design and system specification to be implemented during Phase II.",

        "abstract": "We propose to design and demonstrate beam cleanup for the Master Oscillator (MO) which will allow the Power Amplifier (PA) to operate efficiently and produce a high energy beam useful as a Directed Energy Weapon (DEW). The method we describe is totally new to the DEW field. Of course for low power lasers, we can focus the beam down and pass the clean part through a pinhole spatial filter. The \"noisy\" part is absorbed, so only a perfect beam emerges. The problem is that for even a few watts of laser power, metal pinholes melt and diamond pinholes shatter. At MO power levels, the pinhole method is clearly absurd. Our approach, developed with BMDO for visible light lasers up to a few watts, is to use the angular selectivity of a thick hologram to clean up the beam. It works well. Neither focusing nor absorption is required, so extension to MO power levels seems plausible. We will explore two main issues: handling of useable MO power levels and extension to nonvisible wavelengths as required by many (but not all) candidate MOs. The team includes the company which makes the holographic filters, a consultant involved in its invention, and a consultant with decades of HEL experience.",

NOVA's key design element is the use of a novel and robust electron source based upon field emission phenomena that is capable of delivering high current to the resist for fast, reproducible exposures. Since the design concept includes an emitter array that is somewhat larger than the wafer, patterning of the entire wafer in orthogonal directions is accomplished in only a few steps, and the total wafer travel in these steps is limited to less than 100 um. Thus, the combination of high current density and global exposure assures high wafer throughput. In addition, the traditionally poor reliability of field emission cathodes in an e-beam system is obviated by the unique design of the electron source. This design is expected to increase cathode stability and reliability by many orders of magnitude.",

At present, achievable real-time neutron imaging detector resolution is only about 1 mm.

Here, spatial resolution at the 25 micron level is routinely achieved, over formats as large as 10 x 10 cm(2). Previous attempts to use MCPs in neutron detection schemes employed either a Gd neutron-beta converter coupled to an MCP image intensifier with phosphor screen readout, or a thin Li glass scintillator optically coupled to the MCP, compromising the intrinsic MCP spatial resolution and dynamic range. In sharp contrast, this program proposes the combination of (n,\"varies as\") capture conversion and multiplication processes within the MCP bulk structure itself, fabricated using a lead glass which includes the isotope 10(B). In combination with a fast electronic readout, this innovation will result in a simple, efficient, rugged and compact imaging neutron detector with 15 to 25 um spatial resolution and high dynamic range.",

At present their use is limited to soft and medium formations. It would be highly desirable to expand their use into hard rock, both for drilling of oil and gas and for geothermal applications.  A new type of heat resistant, polycrystalline diamond-containing hard rock cutter will developed in this project.  While composite polycrystalline diamond-tungsten carbide/cobalt cutters have excellent abrasion resistance, they are highly sensitive to the high temperatures that occur when sufficiently drilling hard rock.  Although some polycrystalline diamond materials are known to resist high temperatures, they are not available in the sizes and shapes needed for fast-cutting shear bits, nor is there a means known for bonding thermally stable polycrystalline diamond to a tungsten carbide/cobalt support.  Therefore, this project will develop a cutter consisting of thermally stable polycrystalline diamond bonded to a tungsten carbide/cobalt substrate, which would enable a much more efficient use of thermally stable diamond than previously possible. Phase I will develop a process for economically producing thermally stable polycrystalline diamond disks to exact net shape, investigate several processes for bonding the thermally stable disk to a tungsten carbide support, complete an engineering design of bonding equipment.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Development of a thermally stable diamond disk, together with a high-strength, low-stress bond to a tungsten carbide/cobalt support, will lead to a cutter that will withstand high impact forces and high cutting temperatures. This will enable the use of shear bits in harder formations than hitherto possible. The thermally stable cutter will also find application in bearings for mud motors and gauge protectors for stabilizers and roller-cone bits.",

Release of VOCs has caused a hazardous   situation not only to human health but also to the environment,   such as chloroglurocarbons contributing to the depletion of the   ozone in the stratosphere.  Stricter regulations have been   established to control VOC release.  NOXSO Corporation is proposing   to use organophillic pillared montmorillonite (OPM) to capture and   control VOCs.  This is a new application for the OPMs.   Montmorillonite clays have aluminosilicate layers which posses   negative charges due to the substitutions in the crystal lattice.   This charge is countered by cations between the layers.  Layers are   weakly held together by electrostatic charges and can be separated   in water.  This practice allows exchange of the interlayer cations   with other cations in the solution, and results in a permanent   layer separation which allows access between the layers and the   tailoring of the chemical characteristics of the pillared   montmorillonite by choice of the appropriate exchange ions.  Phase   I will investigate the technical feasibility of this novel VOCs   control technology.  If Phase I is successful, Phase II will   evaluate the technology at pilot scale.",

It relies on an innovative configuration of antenna elements, low noise amplifiers, and matching circuitry which circumvents a formerly universal law of electrically small antennas:  that gain-bandwidth product is proportional to effective volume.  Preliminary studies indicate that an antenna of 0.75 meter extent can operate with 90 percent reception efficiency down to 20MHz.  During Phase I, NTL Technologies Inc. and its subcontractor, AIL Systems Inc., will thoroughly analyze the performance of the proposed configuration with respect to reception efficiency, noise power contribution, and dynamic range.

The device will be built on Er-doped fluoride glass films deposited by a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) process.

Fluoride glasses are inherently superior compared to conventional silicate glasses for the luminescence of rare-earth ions. Fluoride glasses also compatible with large concentration of rare-earth ions. Plasma-enhanced CVD allows the growth of wide variety of materials at very low temperatures. This offers the opportunity to grow high optical quality fluoride glass films. The PECVD is suited for the fluoride glass films due to its large-area, low temperature, high growth rate, and low fabrication cost capabilities. Rare earth doped multicomponent fluoride glasses can be obtained by our innovative single liquid source approach.  The resulted films should be readily adaptable for the fabrication of lossless beam splitters in planar waveguide-forms.",

Ternary nitrides appear to be excellent candidates for second harmonic generation (SHG) because they are transparent in the visible and, due to their noncentrosymmetric (rhombohedral) crystal structure, must exhibit birefringence; the latter is a basic requirement for phase-matching. Use of activated nitrogen from a plasma will permit them to be grown with low defect densities, a must for minimizing optical losses when configured as waveguides. The ability to produce these nitrides as waveguides will increase the interaction length between primary and secondary fields, giving significantly higher power conversion efficiency. Phase matching can further be enhanced by applying external fields transverse to the ternary waveguides. Phase I will determine the conditions needed to grow these new ternary nitride films. Grown films will be measured to determine structural, optical, and electrical properties. A simple second harmonic generation (SHG) experiment will be performed. In Phase II, growth conditions will be optimized and functioning SHG devices demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "The III-V nitride semiconductor family affords many unique properties which make these materials attractive candidates for producing electronic and optoelectronic devices. Much progress has been made in epitaxial thin film growth of nitrides using metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) during the last decade. These efforts are hindered by the lack of lattice-matched substrates. Most studies have employed sapphire substrates for GaN although there is a large mismatch between these materials. GaN films on sapphire substrates have a great number of threading dislocations which propagate up to the surface. Such highly defective material suffers both from low carrier mobilities and lifetimes. Although low temperature, pulsed laser operation has been achieved, the defects may also act as optical scattering centers, preventing the demonstration of a low threshold CW injection lasers operating at room temperature. Recently, LiAl02 and lithium gallate, substrates with improved lattice matching to GaN, have been developed. In preliminary experiments, GaN grown on LAO by ECR MBE at 800 C, exhibited optically pumped stimulated emission. However, MBE is not suitable for production applications and, in addition, LAO and LGO cannot withstand the high temperatures used in conventional MOCVD. NZ Applied Technologies has achieved promising results for GaN growth at low substrate temperatures using a novel MOCVD-based growth process. This approach can yield high quality GaN on LAO or LGO substrates at substrate temperatures which are compatible with these new materials. This would represent the first successful use of MOCVD with LAO or LGO and would pave the way for their use in a manufacturable process for optoelectronic devices.",

Fabrication of these systems is costly.  In this program we propose to develop a single diode-laser pumped mid-IR laser system.  The near-IR intermediate output pumped by the 670-nm A1GaInP diode laser mixes with the residual diode laser beam in a quasi-phase matched (QPM) KTA nonlinear crystal and mid-IR signals is generated by intra-cavity QPM-DFG.  The mid-IR output can be tuned over a wide range by merely tuning the near-IR; no temperature or angle tuning of the KTA crystal is needed.  The tunable mid-IR laser system is all-solid-state, simple, low cost, and highly efficient.

The final transistor structure will rely on a gallium nitride (GaN) film as the second member of the heterojunction.  Ternary nitrides are excellent candidates for service as transistor bases or channels since they offer a wide range of band gaps which are lower than corresponding binary nitrides (GaN, A1N) while being very closely lattice matched, insuring high gain operation.  Our proposed efforts will utilize plasma-enhanced metalorganic chemical vapor deposition, a technology we have developed for the growth of stoichiometeric binary nitrides.  Deposition of the unique series of nitride alloys will require the substitution of several suitable precursor species in place of triethylgallium, while maintaining a high flow rate of activated nitrogen species.   Phase I studies will determine the best growth conditions by systematically varying the substrate temperature and precursor flow ratios in the gas phase, until the process yields excellent quality wide-gap nitride films.  These films will be structurally characterized by electron microscopy and x-ray diffractometry.  Additional optical and electrical measurements will provide feedback for optimizing the growth.

In this program NZ Applied Technologies in collaboration with Las Alamos National Laboratory proposes to develop novel tunable dielectric filters.  This new microwave filter technology holds the promise of significant reduction in size, improvement in performance, and the potential for monolithic integration with GaAs ICs.  Moreover, the electrical tunability of this type of devices is desirable for the wireless communication systems capable of operation across frequency bands and for military microwave systems capable of frequency agility.  This technology forms a base for various advanced microwave devices such as active phase shifters and frequency agile antennas.  The recent advances in complex-oxide thin film processing have opened an unprecedented opportunity to realize the proposed devices.  Our preliminary work has demonstrated the basic performance of frequency resonance and electrical tunability of the proposed devices.  In this Phase I, we will further develop both materials and prototype devices by an innovative plasma-enhanced chemcial vapor deposition (PE-CVD).  The PE-CVD is suitable for high volume and low cost manufacturing.  Anticipated Benefits:  Success in the Phase I effort will provide a viable manufacturing route for advanced microwave filters, which have a huge market potential.  This technology is also a basis for various microwave devices such as tunable delay lines, tunable resonators, parametric amplifiers, and frequency agile phase array antennas.",

A field of 6 to 12 VLAD sonobuoys with modified beamforming are deployed in a pattern surrounding the expected impact point.  Each sonobuoy carries a differential GPS receiver that continuously tracks its location with instantaneous accuracies of 2-4m.  The actual tracks of all sonobuoys are established by smoothing their position data with regression fits.  Acoustic data relayed from the bouys to a central station is processed to suppress background interferences, recognize the surface impact signature, and triangulate to a most probable impact point through hyperbolic fixing using multiple buoy pairs.  A centroid algorithm that weights buoy contributions and over-determining hyperbolic crossings by their measured validities establishes the final location choice.  All of the hardware and most of the software algorithms have been developed and tested in similar applications.  The power of the triangulation and cetroid algorithms supported by a multiple buoy field with GPS location accuracies should permit ultimate impact point determination to within one foot.",

Further, for compelling reasons, it is desired that the recharge energy be acquired locally from the environment, i.e. either surface wave energy or water currents.  The proposed solution utilizes the concept of Hydropiezoelectricity whereby thin plastic sheets of piezoelectric material (PVDF) are employed to directly convert the large available mechanical energy to electrical power for recharging the storage device.  The proposed Phase I effort consists of analysis and simulation tasks designed to determine both the technical and economic feasibility of the approach in typical shallow and deep ocean environments.  A laboratory demonstration of the approach will be provided using power generation modules that are being developed by OPT as part of its efforts to exploit the technology commercially as a source of primary energy.",

        "abstract": "The ultimate goal of this three phase SBIR proposal is to design, develop, fabricate, and test real- time radiography system for inspecting large CDI castings with the emphasis on the production oriented inspection system.  The proposed system takes significant advantage of detector system, data acquisition system, automated data analysis and image display software already developed by Omega.  The propose designs are based on Omega's unique and very high performance detector designs and the Tangential Scanning technique developed for the NSWC Tangential Scanner System for Rocket Motors. The Tangential data collection method has already proven it's advantages in the Rocket Motor System.  It leads to faster scanning rate, smaller data files, larger contrast due to flaws and easier yet faster data analysis.  The Tangential scanning technique will use the natural circular symmetry of the CDI casting for data collection.  In the Tangential Scanner system, the data is naturally collected at the tangent of various diameter circles.  Thus the data is naturally collected through equal amount of steel material.  This leads to mostly equal x-ray signal detected by the detector system.  In such a scanning scheme, abrupt or even slow change in the x-ray intensity is easy to recognize.  The difference in the detected x-ray intensity is usually either due to a flaw or a known feature in the casting.  Simple image analysis techniques like Thresholding, Differentiation, Low Order Curve Fitting, Mask Subtraction and other Convolutions can be used in automated mode to detect flaws and unwanted features in the CDI castings.",

At present, no acceptable technology exists for providing the RF sources needed to construct a viable high energy collider.  This study will show that an efficient, cost effective device can generate high-power radiation at frequencies at 20 GHz and above, with high conversion efficiency and high electrical efficiency. The Phase I project includes:  (a) optimized output waveguide design; (b) improved flexibility in magnetic profile assignment; (c) optimized level and phase for injection phase locking and dynamic suppression of competing modes; and (d) design of an efficient depressed collector to recover energy from the spent beam. These measures are expected to show that a prototype can be built and demonstrated in Phase II.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee: A mechanism for generating high-power cm-wavelength radiation to drive a future electron-positron collider could create a new product line for industry.

The  NAVY must have access to these networks while maintaining  complete internal communications security. A new lossless data  compression technique, based on a new information theory known  as the self-learning Autosophy networks, has recently become  available.  Applications already include disc file compression  software, the V.42bis modem standard and lossless graphics image  compression.  The same methods may be adapted to compress text,  audio, graphics or live television. In the new Autosophy  information theory \"information\" is redefined to depend on data  \"content\", such as \"novelty\" and \"movement\", only.  Everything  already known to the receiver is redundant and need not be  transmitted.  The result is great lossless data compression and  a communications method especially suitable for packet switching  networks.  Additional benefits include: error resistance, a  virtually unbreakable \"codebook\" encryption and complete freedom  from hardware parameter, such as image size, resolution or  scanning rates in television.

To achieve such an objective, robust adaptive nonlinear control schemes are being proposed so that hard nonlinearities such as friction, striction and backlash in the driving mechanisms can be accounted for and reduced through feedback.  During the Phase I efforts, various models for such hard nonlinearities will be investigated and simulation studies will be carried out.  Futhermore, recently developed algorithms by the principal investigator will be applied to compensate for hard nonlinearities such as backlash and variable friction due to aging of the parts and changes in the geometric configuration of the system.  It is long understood that hard nonlinearities arising in the driving mechanism of the turreted weapon systems and in most high accuracy industrial machinery are the major causes of their performance degradation.  These nonlinearities are difficult to model and therefor control.  Among the approaches in handling these problems is the employment of direct drive technology, and addition of new actuators such as those that incorporates smart materials, and the use of magnetic and hydrostatic bearing.  Another approach is through better modeling of these fundamental nonlinearities and thereafter more advanced control designs, we propose here to study different models for there nonlinear effects and to reduce their effects on the system performance through advanced nonlinear control designs may also be utilized for direct drive systems and systems including additional actuators such as ones based on smart materials (e.g., piezoelectrics ceramics).  A testbed will be designed for evaluation purposes.",

The curriculum is based on the SCANS research which defined the workplace competencies and basic skills needed by all students to be high-performers in the global economy.  The project goal is to create curriculum which can be used by all students but which addresses the special needs of disabled students.  Each Workplace Interactive Tutorials will introduce a role model and provides awareness of a possible career path while teaching students to use technology to solve real-life complex problems in the workplace.  Together, the Workplace Interactive Tutorials will create a spiraling curriculum model for K-12 students and address the needs of both college-bound students and those who will join the workforce directly from high school.",

Software will be written in such a way as to be easily portable to UNIX class workstations.  The Phase I objective will be to demonstrate the feasibility of the Ontar multivariate methods of model validation.  Over the last 15 years Ontar has been working in the field of atmospherics, sensor and scene simulation.  After many years of experimenting with validating models, we stand by the simple conclusion that a model is validated when the system under testing cannot tell the difference, in statistical sense, between the real and the simulated results.  The multivariate technique of discriminate function analysis (DFA), is a formalized way to measure and quantify the difference between samples.  for validation the sample types are test samples and real samples.  Because of Ontar's background and experience, we will provide considerably more than what is called for in the Phase I solicitation.  We regard this program as an opportunity to implement a complete \"soup to nuts\" Simulation Model validation\" customer support system.  We will provide additional services, e.g. on-line documentation, training, newsletter, and support.  Ontar anticipates that the successful completion of this program will lead to a CRDA (Cooperative Research and Development Agreement) for the long-term support and development of \"Simulation Model Validation\".  Ontar has successfully entered into agreements with several government agencies and other organizations for technology transfer.  In an era of severe budget cuts this may be the best way to guarantee the life of the product.",

Since YAG is the most widely used laser host crystal, we chose Nd:YAG with undoped YAG ends as the guiding medium for the fabrication of buried channel CWGL, with sapphire as cladding. The lasing transition of Nd3+ in YAG at 946nm will be investigated, since it can be doubled to 488 nm. A wide range of useful CWGL operating from the UV to the IR could be prepared if we succeed in defining process parameters to overcome remaining stress birefringence parallel to the interfaces of the laser-active core. Attractive features will be negligible losses due to scatter, multimode or single mode lasing, lengths of CWGL ranging from microns to about 200 mm, low lasting thresholds, high power output, high efficiency, resulting in devices of improved performance over any exitsting CWGL.",

The ability of solder engineering techniques to passively align electronic and optical components to tolerances of \"approx\" 1 mm will be exploited to simplify the alignment task.  A modified version of the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm will be used to design a compound diffractive optical element which combines the functions of most, or all, of the discrete optical components which currently compose the optical interconnect section of the HPOC module.  Reducing the number of components will greatly reduce the complexity of the assembly and packaging task, and should also significantly reduce the cost of the final device.

The SOF requires highly detailed information for planning and rehearsal, particularly for Operations Other Than War.  The M&S community needs greater detail to capture realism in its simulations. The opputunity defined by this problem is to define the requirements of the SOF and M&S for additional detail in the VMap 3 Product and then identify a cost-effective approach for the Army to supply the data using the organic assets.

        "abstract": "The GPS is an affordable and accurate means of guiding military and civilian aircraft.  However, at times the GPS signal becomes blocked or degraded due to loss of satellite lock or poor viewing angle.  It is necessary to back it up with inertial navigation.  However, there is no INS system which is accurate enough and inexpensive enough to do the job.  A completely monolithic fully integrated INS is proposed which has navigational grade performance yet can be micromachined to provide all the inertial measurements, by virtue of the materials used, the fabrication processes adopted, and the transduction technique.  This INS will be interfaced with GPS.  The two systems will be uncoupled initially.  The Kalman filter will include 17 states.  In Phase II the coupling will be tightened to include feedback states to the GPS first and then to the INS to model its error states.  It has the capability of aligning the INS in flight and of compensating for its drift in real time.",

While spectrometers based on this principle have been very useful, development of a new generation of spectrometers with no moving parts would bring major advances for numerous sensing applications. It could enable real-time measurement, reduced positional uncertainties, reduced spectrometer size, and extended wavelength range. This Phase I project will experimentally test the feasibility of an entirely new type of FT-IR spectrometer. The optical arrangement is designed to produce and detect interferograms in the spatial domain using passive components and a 2-dimensional detector array. Particularly promising features of this array interferometer include high light throughput, a full spectrum time response limited only by the detector, and potential for miniaturization. In Phase I, a laboratory-scale interferometer will be built and tested. The experimental effort will provide information on the apparatus function, resolving power, sensitivity and optical abberations. If the effort is successful, a complete spectrometer system will be developed and commercialized in Phases II and III.",

Recent work on a birefringence based system has resulted in the introduction of a commercial version of the system.  While a significant step toward the goal of a practical stationary  spectrometer, the device still has limited spectral coverage and remains very expensive (from $13,000/unit to $30,000/unit, depending on the spectral coverage).  Under the Phase I program, OPTRA will demonstrate an all-reflective stationary Fourier transform spectrometer, based on the use of Fresnel mirrors and linear detector arrays.  The system will be inherently broadband, being limited only by the detector spectral response.  Moderate sized arrays (256 elements) will provide spectral resolution of better than 2%.  The proposed program also emphasizes the development of both performance models and cost models to assure reasonable prospects for commercialization.",

        "abstract": "The use of imagery in military and civilian applications has expanded greatly in  recent years.  This growth has been driven primarily by the digital revolution in  microelectronics, which has provided the signal processing, memory storage, and  communications technology that make the wider use of images possible.  The very  ability to collect large numbers of images in near-real time creates another  challenge - how to scan all the images and find objects of interest.  The result is  a need for high-speed digital signal and image processing systems and large mass  memory storage devices to process, store, and analyze these data.  To meet this  need, ORINCON proposes during Phase I to complete the following tasks: (1) design  of a coarse-grained parallel computer workstation architecture suitable for image  processing and based on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware, (2) demonstration  of possible 2-D and 3-D visualization techniques for transformed images, (3) design  and documentation of an integrated Operator-Machine Interface (OMI), and (4)  demonstration of a prototype for this image processing workstation.  Phase II  efforts will focus on the implementation of a 20-GFLOPS design capable of  processing at least six different image types in near-real time.",

        "abstract": "Several nonintrusive methods exist to detect faults, such as delaminations, broken leads, traces, and solder joints, and popcorn cracks on circuit cards and integrated circuits (IC).  Ultrasonic scanning is widely utilized by IC manufacturers for this purpose.  However, these failure analysis systems require skilled engineers to operate them.  ORINCON proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of automatically detecting circuit card and IC faults using ultrasonic scanning.  In Phase I, we will apply signal and image processing techniques for optimum feature extraction and intelligent system techniques to automatically detect features representing faults.  The system will be generalized to allow the user to scan an example good card and subsequently scan a problematic card to detect faults.  This system will be based on two commercial off-the-shelf components:  ORINCON'S RIPPEN signal and image processing software and SONIXs HS 1000 HiSpeed acoustic scanning microscope.  The ORINCON-SONIX team is uniquely qualified to perform this research.  ORINCON possesses extensive experience in similar problems involving rotating machinery fault detection, medical ultrasound, and underwater acoustics.  SONIX is a world leader in the development of ultrasonic inspection systems for integrated circuit failure analysis.  In Phase II, the system will be refined and manufacturing plans will be developed.",

        "abstract": "There is a trend towards an architecture that uses digital data buses to transfer information between control system components.  The hurdle to distributed control architecture is that it moves components from benign into harsh environments.  A major challenge is the need for operation at temperatures well above 125 degrees C.  A consortium of US firms has formed to commercialize Silicon on Insulator (SOI) electronics.  This technology promises devices capable of withstanding elevated temperatures.  The associated high temperature packaging for this technology needs to be developed to implement the emerging distibuted controls.  New circuit board materials and designs able to withstand high tempratures need to be developed.  A basic materials set to address high temperature opertion was demonstrated by Toranaga as part of another SBIR Phase I program.  What is needed is a systematic aproach and fabrication and assembly process methods.  The objective of this Phase I effort will be to refine fabrication processes and to investigate assembly methods for low cost high temperature multilayer circuit fabrication for use in distributed controls.  Two applications will be developed and demonstrated: a smart engine vane actuator operating at 200 degrees C and an automotic Anti-locking Brake System controller operating at 150 to 175 degrees C.  Anticipated Military Benefits/Potential Commercial Applications of the Research or Development:  The weight, reliability and cost savings that are achieved by elimination of cooling systems could be enormous.  It will result in the wide scale use of high temperature electronics in numerous military and commercial distributed control applications.  This technology promises to inexpensively and rapidly yield a system for the fabrication of high temperature circuits.  These new materials and system will increase reliability, reduce processing steps and complexity, and reduce cost over conventional high temperature packages such as cermic MCMs or polymide/glass printed circuit boards.",

        "abstract": "Ortel proposes to investigate methods of performing closed loop   control of optically linearized modulators for use in externally   modulated analog fiberoptic links.  These links are becoming more   popular at 1550 nm because of lower optical loss at the longer   wavelength, and because of the availability of low-noise   all-optical amplifiers (EDFAs).  Ordinary Mach Zehnder modulators   have poor third-order intermodulation performance.  Optically   linearized modulators overcome this limitation at the expense of   great sensitivity to operating parameters.  In order to achieve the   best possible linearity over the temperature range and lifetime of   the transmitter, it is necessary to perform closed loop control of   the splitting ratio between the RF inputs to the optically   linearized modulator, as well as bias voltage control.  A method is   proposed to perform closed loop minimization of third-order   distortion in these modulators by controlling the RF splitting   ratio.  We also propose to investigate methods of bias voltage   control for minimization of second-order distortion.",

We propose a program to develop a high-power 1550 nm InGaAsP integrated MOPA structure with an on-chip mode converter to simplify coupling to a single-mode optical fiber.  In Phase I, we will develop a design for an integrated semiconductor amplifier and mode converter.  The design concept will be demonstrated in a working prototype with single-mode fiber coupled output.  Predicted output power improvements from a fully optimized, integrated MOPA structure will be modeled and analyzed.|  Benefits:  High power optical sources at 1550 nm will improve the dynamic range of externally modulated fiberoptic links used in military applications such as antenna remoting and signal processing.

Packing firms, who purchase and process pigs for consumption, financially penalize the swine producer if the weight of a pig is not within specified guidelines.  However, routinely weighing pigs is a laborious, time consuming task which can take away from other needed duties on the swine farm.\n\nOur approach is to develop an automated weighing system that will provide the swine producer the needed information to effectively manage the farm's feeding program and to identify which pigs would meet market weight guidelines to minimize financial penalties.",

The development of a low energy coating based on the integration of well defined fluorocarbon, oxazoline, and dendrimer technologies is proposed herein as a highly viable approach to overcoming the limitations of existing products. Precise control of dendrimer architecture will permit the formulation of of high performance fluorocarbon coatings with optimal chemical, mechanical, thermal, and rheological properties for DOD applications.  Moreover, the potential advantages of dendrimer coatings over conventional fluoropolymers include water-based application, superior adhesive bonding and barrier properties, lower formulation viscosity, and enhanced cure rates.",

        "abstract": "It has been shown that targets buried in deep clutter such as camouflaged tanks and missile launchers can be identified using spectral band correlation techniques.  The narrower the spectral band the more accurate the correlation statistics.  What is needed to identify manmade objects buried in deep cluttered backgrounds is an instrument with the capability of tunable multi-spectral image data collection with bandwidth selection and coverage that spans the spectral region from visible to the thermal infrared.  The Pacific Advanced Technology Image Multi-spectral Sensor, (IMSS), has the capability to fulfill the Navy's requirements for an adaptive multi- spectral imaging sensor which can be flown on an airborne platform for deep hide target detection.  This proposed program will culminate in a multi-spectral sensor that will be ready to integrate into a the Navy's P3 surveillance aircraft. The technical objective of the Phase I effort is to prove feasibility for a conceptual design for a Phase II hardware multi-spectral imaging instrument development effort.  Another objective is to secure a Phase II partner willing to financially support the Phase II effort in matching funds.  This will allow Pacific Advanced Technology to qualify for the 'fast track program\".",

We describe three applications or scenarios that form the basis for a requirements-driven sensor design.  These scenarios involve the need for sensors to detect, monitor, and characterize underground facilities capable of producing or testing weapons of mass destruction.  Technical objectives are to identify sets of application-specific sensor performance characteristics and to incorporate these characteristics into a flexible design.  The three function areas of antenna design, noise reduction techniques, and signal processing hold the key to sensor operation at different frequencies and with different signal extraction requirements.  Our modular design will maximize the functions in common modules and thereby minimize the changes necessary for different applications.",

It is proposed to limit the aero-optic effects to   the aircraft-generated turbulence in the region occupied by the   engine exhaust gases and the wake vortices.  The algorithms and   software will be designed to operate conveniently and with   reasonable run-time on a high-end PC (486/66 DX Intel chip or   Pentium chip) or workstations such as SUN's SPARC 10 series.  To   this end, the algorithm employed for both laser propagation and   Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) will be heuristically tailored   to the significant regimes identified during the current USAF   program on Turbulence Interactions (TI).  In addition, the   propagation and turbulence data collected during the TI program   will be provided as an accessible database for future use.

Indium phosphide is a well known semiconductor with application as a laser diode in fiberoptic communication and as a substrate for MMIC and MAFET devices for ultrahigh speed communication, computing and integrated electro-optics. InP also displays the photorefractive effect which can be utilized for infrared optical signal processing. For solar power applications, III-V's have a potential for over 30% efficiency. Parke Mathematical Laboratories, Inc. proposes to develop a novel method for high pressure synthesis of metal phosphides that has the potential to reduce the cost of III-V and II-IV-V2 materials by combining direct synthesis from highly purified elements with crystal growth from the melt executed in contiguous steps without opening the furnace. The proposed method, in contrast to in-situ techniques currently under development, will be more easily controlled, exhibit greater reproducibility, yield stoichiometric melts necessary for successful crystal growth, readily scaled, and will be much less subject to catastrophic failure. Successful development and implementation of the proposed concepts will result in a process that will eliminate the complex, multi-step feed synthesis method that is the current industry standard. Reduced manufacturing costs should be reflected in a lower product cost and wider utilization of single crystal phosphide materials.",

        "abstract": "We propose to develop an inexpensive, high performance closed-cycle  cascade J-T cryocooler. The cryocooler will be based on a high pressure ratio,  oil-free, metal diaphragm compressor.  This innovative compressor will be  compact, inexpensive and extremely reliable. The compressor can either be  used with single-stage mixed-gas or multi-stage cascade cycles. For a  single-stage mixed gas cryocooler, the compressor will allow reduced cost and  higher reliability due to the elimination of oil cleanup systems. It will also enable  a new class of high performance low-cost cryocoolers based on the cascade  J-T cycle.  In Phase I we will design and fabricate a proof-of-concept model of this  compressor, measure its volumetric efficiency and pressure ratio, and use it to  drive a commercial mixed-gas J-T cold head. We will also show that the  compressor will be inexpensive to manufacture in volume due to its lack of  close-tolerance parts.  In Phase II, we will design and fabricate a complete two-stage cascade J-T  cryocooler.  We expect that this cooler will exhibit a mean time to failure in  excess of three years, be inexpensive to manufacture and offer efficiencies  comparable to the best small Stirling cycle cryocoolers.",

        "abstract": "The performance of lasers, solar cells, and other devices   fabricated from doped GaAs wafers depends strongly on the quality   of the underlying wafer.  For best performance, the wafers must   have uniform carrier concentration and low defect density.  GaAs   wafer manufacturers and users currently do not have a rapid,   non-destructive way of measuring these parameters.  As a result,   GaAs devices remain expensive due to relatively low device yields.  We propose to develop a system to measure these properties by   measuring the wafer transmissibility at selected wavelengths in the   IR.  The proposed imaging IR system will allow rapid, accurate,   high-resolution and inexpensive measurement of wafer electrical   properties.  In Phase I, Creare will prove the feasibility of the   method by developing proof-of-concept hardware and software and   comparing the NDE measurements with results from conventional   destructive techniques.  In Phase II, we will automate the system   and make it clean-room compatible.",

Only a hydrofoil craft can achieve this (i.e. L/D greater than 40 for the foil alone). A recent surface proximity hydrofoil theory suggests (in contrast to the traditional theory) that large span foil with a conventional sub-cavitating foil section can reach these speeds without cavitating.  Our proposed Phase I includes experiments which will resolve this question.  If it turns out that the new surface proximity theory is incorrect, it is still theoretically possible to achieve the required performance with the \"planning foils\" (atmospherically vented upper surface and hence no possibility of cavitation) which we are developing.  The ride of conventional hydrofoil would be intolerably rough in a seaway at 100-200 knots.  We have been developing a foil suspension system during the last several years which avoids this and other problems, using a four ton \"Dynafoil\" prototype boat.  We propose to design a second a second prototype during Phase I which, built early in Phase II, will serve as a demonstrator for the technologies critical to a full size sealift ship.  Since two independent investors have already contributed nearly one million dollars to this program, it's anticipated that Phase II could be co-sponsored under the new DoD Fast Track procedure.",

CMP is an important technology to support multilayer interconnect.  Since the results of CMP is dependent on the topography of the chip, systematic spatial variations due to layout pattern dependencies are, today, unavoidable.  Since CMP variation dominate interconnect dielectric variation, these systematic spatial dependence can have a significant impact on speed variations and potential race conditions.  By leveraging from existing research at MIT, as well as PDF's background in TCAD frameworks and statistical modeling, we propose to determine the requirements software and engineering methods which couple CMP equipment, chip and feature level simulation.  The eventual goal is to provide an environment for predicting the variations in interconnect capacitance as a function of CMP equipment settings.  Such a system would help defray the costs of applying CMP to low volume products.  This project will have widespread impact on CMP tool and sensor improvement; process design, optimization and control; and integrated circuit design for manufacturability.  Development of software which makes CMP techniques more affordable and reliable is of great interest to most commercial and military manufacturers.  Moreover, only physically-based simulation will render CMP viable for low-volume applications such as those common in the defense community.",

In many military and civilian jobs, employees will have to be   adaptable in the 2000's.  However, valid measures of   adaptability-related constructs do not exist.  With those points in   mind, the objectives of Phase I are to:  (1) develop a working   model of adaptability--specifying major cognitive and dispositional   variables involved in adaptation along with the expected   interactions among them; (2) develop prototype measures of   adaptability-related cognitive and dispositional constructs   amendable to routine administration--generic measures that will be   appropriate in both military and civilian settings; (2) develop   prototypes of criterion measures that measure adaptability in   real-world settings; and (4) provide a framework for demonstrating   the criterion-related validity of the measures developed on the   basis of this model.",

        "abstract": "While the need for an informed partnership between teenagers with disabilities, family members, educators and employers is ever apparent, there appears to be a scarcity of relevant, accessible video programming for these groups.  \n\nIn light of this need, People Productions proposes to create a series of programs on videotape that respond to the issue of teens with disabilities making the transition from school to work.  \n\nAn exceedingly high dropout rate, procrastination in entering transitional programs, student apathy and employer resistance to change are just a few of the problems a well-produced video series could seek to remedy.  The messages brought forth by a thoughtful examination of this issue would be well served through the medium of television, the most powerful technology by which messages are instilled into our culture.\n\nWe are currently in communication with the Colorado Department of Education and others involved with the School-to-Work Initiative, the Transistions Project and IDEA, who have agreed to act as consultants.  In addition, our nationwide research will lead us to others vital in the field of school-to-work as we proceed with writing the final treatment and script for the series.",

The dichloro polymer is the key intermediate in production steps that lead to a class of polymers having useful engineered applications, often where extremes of temperature and environment exist.  A supercritical polymerization process could eliminate the hazards, handling, environmental concerns, and waste disposal costs associated with the current solvent-intensive polyphosphazene processes.  The unique extraction and separation properties of supercritical fluids will be exploited to produce poly (dichlorophosphazene) free of contaminants and at a molecular weight useful for further modification.  This proposal addresses issues related to solubilizing high molecular weight intermediate and promoting high yield polymerization in the supercritical medium.  The cost benefits associated with supercritical fluid polymerization will be evaluated by carrying out an economic viability analysis of the process.",

The recent development of the CMOS active pixel sensor (APS) by the proposers during their former  employment at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has, for the first time, permitted large scale  integration of supporting circuitry and smart camera functions on the same chip as a high  performance image sensor.  Furthermore, the random access mode of pixel readout enabled by the  APS permits readout of a moving window of interest.  Moving this window in retro-grade  synchronicity with platform motion can permit the electronic stabilization and deblurring of the  imagery.  Thus, there exists an opportunity to develop a highly compact electronically stabilized  camera that can be mass produced at an affordable cost.  In Phase I, an electronically stabilized camera system will be defined and requirements identified.   The majority of the effort will be in the design of a CMOS APS image sensor chip with on-chip ADC  and a motion control interface for the readout window.  An initial design for the camera system  including optics and mechanical housing will be performed.   This work will create foundation for  Phase II in which the CMOS APS image sensor will be fabricated and integrated into a prototype  camera system demonstration.",

In Phase I, methods to achieve the micropower microdot CMOS APS (including optics) would be investigated.  The starting point will be the state-of-the-art very low power CMOS APS technology developed by the proposers during their former employment at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

PAAs offer many advantages including steering without physical movement, accurate beam pointing, increased scan exiility in two dimensions, precise PAA element phase and amp etude control to obtain low sidelobes, and reduced power consumption and weight.  The complexity associated with controlling the many thousand array elements, while handling the broad bandwidth required of a shared antenna, makes the marriage of photonics and microwave radar attractive.  To satisfy the simultaneous requirements of wide bandwidth and large antenna scan angle, true-time-delay (TTD) steering techniques are required so that efficient elemental vector summation (in the receive mode) or distribution (in the transmit mode) can be obtained that is independent of frequency or angle. our approach utilizes the inherent advantages of optical fiber for both signal distribution and TTD beam steering using a combination of laser diodes, integrated optical modulators, and integrated and bulk optical switches.  All of these components are commercially available with their continued development driven by the massive commercial market for digital fiber optic communication and cable television. our design avoids active optical devices which severely limit system dynamic range and noise figure.",

In order to address the  problem of motion sickness specifically associated with the use of Helmet  Mounted Displays; (HMDs) Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to  develop an Automatic Vestibular Compensator (AVC) device that can be  installed in existing head mounted displays.  POC proposes a system for eliminating the effects of motion sickness in users  of HMDs.  The AVC employs a cluster of microsensors capable of sensing  acceleration and rotation, mounted onto an existing HMD as a synthetic  vestibular system.  The output of this system generates visual cues within the  HMD display (such as artificial horizon).  Unlike other designs, the proposed  system conditions its acceleration and rotation to correspond to the response  of the natural vestibular system.  In Phase I, initial simulator testing of HMDs  incorporating visual cues will be performed based on the programmed path of  the simulator in conjunction with head tracking data.  In these trials, various  accelerometers and piezo-gyros will be mounted on the user's head and  evaluated.  The resulting information will guide the design of the Phase II  system.",

        "abstract": "To address the Navy's requirement for an increase in the throughput  of image and/or other sensor processing, Physical Optics Corporation  (POC) proposes to develop an application-specific ultra high speed  processor.  POC will comprehensively study the advances in  electronics technology and associated design aids, and the specific  needs of real-time perspective scene generation.  Recent advances in  submicron very large-scale integration (VLSI) technology have made  possible the integration of millions of transistors on a single chip,  while advanced packaging techniques (such as multi-chip module  bonding) can reduce physical size, power consumption, and weight.  Also, optoelectronic interconnects can be used to increase the board-  to-board data bandwidth.  User-friendly computer-aided design tools  are available to assist in the rapid prototyping of high-performance  computing systems.  All of these technological breakthroughs will be  used to develop the ultra high speed processors for real-time imagery  processing.  The processor's computational power can be in the range  of tens of billion operations per second.  A variety of  configurations can be supported to meet the needs of different  applications, including both on-board and off-board imagery sources.",

This frequency shifter is compatible with erbium optical amplifiers,  can accommodate a wideband modulated optical signal, and will exhibit low spurious signals and fast response to variations in Doppler frequency bandwidth.  POC will accomplish this through the extremely efficient acousto-optic interaction between guided optical waves and guided surface acoustic waves, propagating collinearly in a LinbO3 substrate.  Implementing this device into a radar optical signal processing system will reduce complexity weight, size, and cost compared to RF systems.",

Current approaches use physical lamination and coextrusion methods using thin plates of glass or plastic film.  POC proposes a unique method of fabricating a large number of graded-index layered waveguides in a single polymer film by a simple holographic (interferometric) standing-wave recording technique.  This is superior to current methods in that it can simultaneously generate large numbers of thin graded-index channel waveguide layers by a single holographic recording process, and can fabricate input and output holographic couplers in each waveguide layer -- not possible in other approaches.  Since POC's approach uses well established low-cost polymer materials and simple fabrication methods, it is commercially very attractive.  In Phase I, POC proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach by computer modeling and analysis of the optically producible multiplanar waveguide structure; to identify suitable volume holographic polymer materials; and to experimentally characterize the proposed concept.",

This project will design, fabricate, and test a new miniature spectrometer to be implemented in the DOE atmospheric measurement program. The device will be based on a novel optical filter with spectral selectivity distributed along the aperture, and will be designed in Phase I. The filter, using a novel double-wedge holographic resonator in a vernier configuration, acts as a dispersive element. The combination of  a double-wedge resonator (to distribute the transmitted wavelength linearly across the aperture in a direction perpendicular to the filter's optical axis) and a vernier configuration (to ensure high effective finesse) will result in high (subangstrom) resolution across the selected bandwidth (from several to hundreds of nanometers) in the W, visible and IR range. This low-cost filter will be rugged, compact (centimeters) and light (grams), and will contain no moving parts or liquid in the resonator. Phase II will implement the filters in the design and fabrication of a miniature spectrometer that will meet DOE requirements.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee: The  miniature, rugged, high-resolution, low-cost spectrometer, should have value for both government agencies and private industry. Applications range from atmospheric measurement and sampling technology to biology and medicine, and to research in astrophysics and in terrestrial environments.

This project will develop a group-specific active optical chemical sensor for halohydrocarbons (including trichloroethylene, dichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, and l, l, l-trichloroethane) that can be interfaced with a cone penetrometer for subsurface applications. Other active optical halohydrocarbon sensors, which rely on liquid-phase chemical reactions of target compounds with pyridine-based indicator solutions, are unsuitable for use in cone penetrometers.

Savi and the Navy/Marine Corps have been developing the Radel (Radio Label),, an innovative Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tag for a Radel-based Automatic Container manifesting System (RACMS). The Radel is an RFID tag designed to be placed on individual items (pallets, ammunition, etc.) that are then loaded into a shipping container.  The Radel is associated with the National Stock Number (NSN) of the item to which is attached.  A Radel detector, mounted inside the container, automatically collects each item's Radel information (NSN) and builds the complete container manifest.  The manifest is then electronically transferred to a SealTag mounted on the outside of the container, which stores the manifest in a database from which can be queried via wireless from hand held of fixed interrogators.  The SealTag and Interrogators are part of the DoD, currently deployed Savi Asset Management System (SAMS).

(PSI) and its partner, the Center for Marine Science,  Environment and Technology (CMAST) at the University of Massachusetts at  Dartmouth propose to develop a methodology and system for predicting the  presence of large marine mammals and other relevant marine species in ocean  areas where Naval exercises may be carried out.  A five task program will be  accomplished including a literature survey, assessment of satellite data  availability, the definition of relevant species migration data and dynamic  models and the design of a prototype airborne sensor.  This information will be  used to design and develop a methodology exploiting a two step evaluation  process based on satellite and airborne data which will meet the defined Navy  requirement.  The result of this study will be an evaluation of the feasibility of  such a system and the definition of a proof-of-concept demonstration to verify  our conclusions.  Once the demonstration is successfully accomplished in a  successor Phase II program, the Navy will have an established methodology  which can be utilized to ensure that no significant harm to endangered or  commercially important marine species occurs as a result of fleet exercises.",

        "abstract": "Physical Sciences, Inc. (PSI) and our subcontractor Textron Systems Division (TSD) propose to develop multifunctional, compact (thin), yet low-mass, composites for applications to space systems on small satellites.  In addition to providing mechanical strength for structural enclosures, these materials will be significantly more effective in shielding against ionizing space radiation than traditional composites on a unit volume basis and traditional metals on a unit mass basis.  Starting with graphite-epoxy composite as the baseline (control) material, our idea is to embed into the epoxy powders of materials which efficiently increase the attenuation (scattering and absorption) of protons and electrons.  For EMI shielding, we  will consider high electrical conductance metal foils (or vapor deposits) on the inner face of the composite panel.  The outer, space-exposed face of the panel, coated with proper surface treatments, will provide thermal control as well as protection against atomic oxygen.  Phase I program will include stopping power calculations for representative embedded composites, and for selected cases, Monte-Carlo modeling of proton an electron scattering to determine their radiation absorption characteristics.  We will process and fabricate of samples of radiation-hardened composites; measure proton beam attenuation through the samples at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory, and conduct preliminary high frequency EMI attenuation testing.|  Benefits:  Compare, low mass radiation hardened shields, made of high strength-to-weight ratio composites, have wide application as structural enclosures for spacecraft and payload systems on military and commercial satellites, resulting in substantial reductions in total spacecraft weight.  The technology can be directly and effectively adapted to commercial applications which require shielding against neutrons, e.g. hazardous nuclear environments.|",

        "abstract": "Physical Sciences, Inc. (PSI) proposes to develop an etching tool based upon its patented Fast Atom Sample Tester (FAST) technology that addresses a critical processing problem faced by manufacturers of Bonded wafers.  The fabrication process for bonded wafers results in a 5 mm wide strip of partially delaminated silicon along the perimeter of the 8-in. wafer which can serve as a source of unacceptable particle contamination.  This 25\u00c2\u00bfm thick damage area must be removed by a fast (5 min/wafer), all-dry method which does not remove the underlying Si02 layer.  The proposed etching tool employs the FAST technology to generate a uniform, hyperthermal (2 to 15 eV translational energy) fluorine atom beam, concentrated over the delaminated film.  The unique characteristics of the FAST technology including its tunable translational energy range, low ion content, and pulsed nature enable high rate, selective, damage-free, and controlled removal of the delaminated film which meets the stated processing goals.  The technology is demonstrated on 8-in. bonded wafers in the Phase I program.  In Phase II, a commercial prototype etching tool would be fabricated.  The proposed effort includes a collaboration with SiBond, a leading producer of bonded wafers that will assure the etching tool meets industry requirements.",

The proposed device would exploit the latest in sensitive, cost-effective, uncooled thermal imaging technology developed largely under DOD sponsorship.  The basic concept to be investigated for feasibility in Phase I entails pressurizing a tank internally with warm air (which may be seeded with an appropriate concentration of a molecular absorber to enhance thermal IR emission/absorption) and visualizing leaks with a thermal IR imager.  To enhance image contrast the imager may also be equipped with an appropriately chosen bandpass limiting filter(s).  A Phase I proof-of-concept feasibility study is proposed that will research the most appropriate thermal IR imaging technology to use for this application that is consistent with detecting the predicted infrared signatures resulting from escaping plumes of the heated air mixture.  Feasibility will be assessed on the basis of portability, cost, sensitivity and resolution as well as reliability and ease of use.  In addition to paper assessment studies, feasibility of the propsed detection scheme will be demonstrated through small scale laboratory experiments.",

The AMCILOG has the potential for producing microwaves with efficiencies exceeding 45%.  Phase I will numerically simulate the AMCILOG, finding optimum beam voltages and currents, magnetic fields, and cyclotron harmonics. For the simulations, the existing base of codes that can be used to model AMCILOG performance will be expanded by adding provisions for realizable magnetic field profiles, realistic cavity field profiles, realistic electron beam distributions, and buncher cavities. With these codes, a complete system will be designed, with particular attention paid to the details of the electron gun, input cavity, magnetic field system and output cavity.  The magnetic field design will consider all regions (electron gun, magnetic compression, field reversal, and circuit region) and the output cavity will be designed for maximum efficiency. The performance of the design with respect to parameter variations will be completely characterized. Finally, an initial mechanical design will be performed.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The AMCILOG configuration is capable in principle of efficiently generating high power microwaves in gyrotron-like output configurations at high harmonics of the cyclotron frequency. This feature would make the AMCILOG device particularly attractive for applications requiring either compact/light weight sources or high frequency (millimeter wave) signals.

A fundamental problem associated with sensing the intensity of light is that intensity gives one parameter while the surface orientation of objects has two degrees of freedom.  Physics Innovations Inc. is developing thermal imaging techniques where, in each image pixel, three of the four Stokes parameters are sensed.  The Stokes parameters are chosen to be intensity, percent of polarization, and angle of the plane of polarization. Although conventional unpolarized thermal infrared intensity images of terrestrial scenes have low contrast, images of percent of polarization and angle of the plane of polarization have useful contrast for different surface orientations.  This added contrast should facilitate image segmentation and classification of objects.    In the proposed project, we will more than double the spatial resolution of our polarization-sensitive thermal imaging sensor.  The sensor will also be able to capture polarimetric data for point source objects, e.g. targets at long range.  High-resolution polarimetic data can be captured and displayed in nearly real time.",

In particular, the x-ray/gamma-ray telescope can be mounted in the Open Skies Treaty aircraft to provide a capability of detect, characterize and identify nuclear weapons development work.  Objectives of the development program include:  (1) adapting an existing gamma-ray telescope previously built under DNA sponsorship for use in the Open Skies aircraft, (2)  designing a handheld instrument to be carried by inspectors during on-site inspections, and (3) conducting field tests and analytical studies to determine the optimum design and expected performance for each treaty\u00c2\u00bfs testing requirements.  These objectives will be accomplished during Phase I by successfully completing three technical tasks, viz., determining each treaty\u00c2\u00bfs inspection requirements, conducting an analytical/experimental program, and completing the detailed design of the x-ray/gamma-ray telescope for both aircraft and handheld applications.  For the Open Skies aircraft, the x-ray/gamma-ray telescope will provide a new capability and support nonproliferation as well as counter-proliferation activities.",

Most of these short 8-12 amino acid long sequences are generated by proteolytic fragmentation in the cell cytoplasm, prior to transport into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by transporters of antigenic peptides (TAP), where they associate with nascent class I heavy chains and B(second power)-microglobulin.  Herpesviruses are double stranded DNA viruses which establish latent infections and are widely prevalent in the host population.  We have generated a protocol to characterize T-cell epitopes presented by MHC class I molecules and recognized by CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL).  We propose the three following technical AIMS:  (1)  HLA class I transfectants of C1R (EBV-B cell) will be infected with HHV-1 resulting in cell surface expression of viral epitopes presented by a uniform population of class I alleles.  (2) Identify relevant viral peptide epitopes presented in the context of HLA-A1, -A2, -A3, -A11, and -A24.

Our basic system concept is a vertical  array of source elements mounted orthogonal to planar receiver aperture.  The vertical  source aperture projects At near horizontal angles to avoid the deleterious effects of  high angle reverberation.  The receive array will have substantial planar aperture in  order to form narrow beams to further reject reverberation and localize the target in  azimuth.  We have investigated geometries and configurations for autonomously  deployed planar sonar arrays and have developed an approach employing dipole sensors,  which allows advantageous characteristics for sonobuoy and other applications.  We  will exercise engineering tradeoff studies of several approaches to develop a  recommended small object avoidance architecture; we are introducing this dipole  sensor array as a probable prime candidate receiver for detection of small objects  in turbid water.  In-buoy beamforming with a highlight identifier will be used, in  order to minimize data relay requirements.",

The first stage is an electrical reciprocating pump that creates hydraulic pressure to actuate the second stage.  The second state is a metering pump.  The advantages of the new metering pump are:  1) The pump operates without a control system. 2) Dynamic seals are eliminated. 3) Compact size and simplicity. 4) Improved reliability. 5) Low cost.  A flow rate reference command sets the rotational frequency of an electric motor.  The stroke distance is maintained constant and its accuracy does not affect the performance of the pump.  The volume of liquid per cycle is maintained constant to a high degree of accuracy and repeatability.  The design uses only off the shelf commercial components and is geared toward high quantity, low cost production.",

Design rationale tools have been shown to be effective in supporting this process, but are infrequently used due to their interference with normal design team workflow.  The rapid growth of new network and web-mediated workstyles offers the opportunity to bring design rationale tools into normal workflow.  However, existing tools require the designer to think in terms of the structures the tools provide.  Further, few are integrated into modern net-mediated workflows which emphasize shared workspaces and rapid, asynchronous email exchanges.  Full acceptance of such tools requires reduction of the data entry burden they impose.  We believe that through restricted use of natural language understanding and full text information retrieval, we can bridge the gap between the specialized notations typically used in design rationale systems and the informal discussion that typifies dialog among design team members.  We propose a thorough study of the opportunities for integration of these technologies into a design rationale tool, followed by detailed design and partial prototyping of the key capabilities we identify.",

This project will develop an imaging second harmonic interferometer which is extremely compact, vibration insensitive, and can resolve spatial variations of a few millimeters and temporal changes as fast as 20 \u00c2\u00bfs. Second harmonic interferometry measurements have demonstrated that single chord resolution of nc1~1013 cm-3 could be obtained on a fusion plasma.

These switches are capable of ultrafast switching GW peak power electrical pulses within high temperature environments, operate with subnanosecond delay, rise time, jitter, and electrical pulse shape programmability. The switch developed in Phase I will operate with 30 MW peak powers, 0 - 30 kV voltage range, 5 kA current capacity, < 5 ns rise time, and subnanosecond delay and jitter within temperature ranges of 300 - 500 C. The effects of high temperature operation on the maximum switching voltage, rise time, jitter, laser trigger energy, and switch lifetime will be studied. Phase II will further advance the technology to achieve the following operating parameters: 0 - 200 kV voltage capacity, 5 kA current capacity, subnanosecond rise time, subnanosecond delay and jitter, and > 20 Hz repetition rates, with 1 ns 10 mJ laser.

Such cased material could replace steel gears, crankshafts, pinions, and other parts requiring wear resistance. The net result would be more fuel efficient, less costly industrial and consumer activities. A majority of work in forming such coatings requires ion nitriding, laser processing, plasma technology, and even surface melting and resolidification. All these methods are difficult and capital intensive processing. This project will look at a simpler, more cost effective approach: gas nitriding and/or carburizing in a fluidized bed furnace. To do this, a suitable gas composition and time must be identified. Decomposition products of candidate gas mixtures will be considered to ascertain the required off-gas handling requirements to prevent adverse environmental impacts.  Then, some example cases will be made and characterized with respect to chemistry and physical properties.",

Innovative preform fabrication and diaphragm forming consolidation approaches will be developed in Phase I for producing high modulus glass ceramic matrix composite (GCMC) BMDO structures.  These composites can replace metal alloys in critical high temperature BMDO, aerospace, and commercial applications for weight savings, more efficient combustion and other high value survivability enhancements. We will combine GCMC s from Corning with a diaphragm forming process and use intelligent, sensor-based process control to achieve first time quality and lower fabrication costs.  Technologies developed in the program will be demonstrated in Phase II by the fabrication and test of an MDA BMDO/missile component. Successful demonstration of this technology will advance its use in applications critical to national security and will create dual-use opportunities.  Our technical support partners SRI and MDA bring key technology to the Program and are motivated by future benefits in their respective technology resulting from the effort.  We will vigorously pursue future opportunities to create and productize new markets for ceramic matrix composites and for sensor-based intelligent processing.",

In Phase I we will develop low cost techniques to place the fiber optic sensors in the filament wound composite structures, fabricate representative Army missile components such as the Patriot Advanced Capability -3 (PAC-3) rocket motor case, mid-body section, or launch canister; characterize the strength of the filament wound composite material containing the fiber optic sensors; perform structural tests on missile components to demonstrate the ability of the fiber optic sensors to accurately measure strain, displacement, and temperature; and track costs to show the impact onoverall system cost of incorporating smart structures in missile components.  Our aerospace mentor Loral Vought Systems will provide us with Army missile applications and requirements such as the PAC-3.  Production Products will apply the sensor and filament winding technology to Army rocket motor case or pressure vessel applications and commercialize the technology in Phase II.  The anticipated benefits of this program include:  lowering the cost of fiber optic sensor technology by implementation into large volume Army missile applications, improved process control from cure monitoring sensors and accurate structural health monitoring during service.

        "abstract": "This proposal describes a unique method and system for decomposing a  composite acoustic observation into a consistent set of sources.  Unlike many  current approaches, the emphasis in this method is to maximize the human  auditory system's unparalleled ability to associate signal components in a  cluttered environment.  Visual and audio tools are combined to allow rapid  evaluation of decomposition hypotheses and to record statistical results.  The  human auditory system is capable of many remarkable feats, including the  recognition of familiar sources using only short intervals of very corrupted data,  and the association of signal components from many practical acoustic  problems, human interpretation may be the best tool available for several  objectives, especially the proper decomposition of a composite signal into its  several sources and subsequent formulation of mathematical or physical  models of acoustic events.  This is particularly true in sonar and the study of  marine mammal vocalizations.  This paper describes an interactive analysis  system developed with the expressed intent to facilitate human auditory  interpretation of acoustic signals.  The system provides the analyst with a set of  audio tools to facilitate auditory hypothesis testing and supplements them  with  visual and statistical descriptions.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this proposed effort is to research innovative methods for  facilitating COTS technology infusion into embedded computer systems with a  focus on affordability and ease of transition.  Many of today's systems have become dead-ended due to architecture and  hardware evolutions.  As the technology curve has steepened, system  components become dated in an ever-decreasing period of time.  End-of-life  issues are generally solved by wholesale replacement.  However, if discipline is  applied in design, the anticipated, future migration effort for even differing  architecture systems can be significantly minimized. The intent of this effort is to provide infusion assessment and management  tools, strategies, and methodologies for creating resilient system designs.   Although recent reform has enabled COTS deployment within defense systems,   the approach to developing these systems relies on \"Specialized\" high end  components to meet requirements. This stategy, albeit significantly more cost  effective than full military development, has some significant disadvantages  due to the relatively small user base. However, as the demand for desktop  processing and throughput continues to pace technology growth, a  convergence of capability is likely to be realized in the near future. A strategy to  capitalize on this convergence will allow governement programs to fully benefit  from \"True COTS\" by leveraging a vast user base orders of magnitude greater  than today's specialized COTS market. The concepts developed under this  research will assist in realizing a vision of ageless system designs.",

However, low pressure engines are limited in performance and become large, taking up valuable space and increasing vehicle weight. Thus there is strong incentive to achieve improved propulsion efficiency by going to higher pressure. This becomes much more attractive if pressurant system weight and volume are reduced by heating the gas.  It is proposed to develop a system of heating pressurant by catalytically induced reaction of gases mixed with the pressurant below the normal combustion limit. This safe and very simple system has been demonstrated years ago but never flown. This effort proposes to bring the technology to flight readiness.",

        "abstract": "Ultrasonic imaging is the preferred method for noninvasive tissue examination and real-time blood flow analysis.   Foreign items (e.g., radiolucent shrapnel) embedded in the body can also be imaged.  While this would greatly aide combat field medics and civilian emergency medical technicians, current ultrasound scanners are too large, heavy, and power-consumptive for battery operation.  Major scanner functions' size, weight, and power must be significantly reduced for portable operation.  The beamformer dynamically focuses, apodizes, and steers both transmitted and received ultrasonic wave forms.  Modern beamformers typically utilized an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) at each element, followed by digital memory and signal processing circuitry.  The beamformer is amenable to the extensive size, weight, and power reduction possible using charge-couple device (CCD) technology.  This  technology is integrable with conventional CMOS.  The proposed beamformer provides the same functionality as digital designs but at 1% their size, weight, power, and for 10% their cost, while increasing resolution ten-fold.  During Phase I, the CCD/CMOS beamformer's feasibility will be assessed.  A preliminary beamformer design will be developed in coordination with TRP and industry personnel.  A prototype beamformer will be fabricated and evaluated during Phase II.  During Phase III, the beamformer will transition to production in military and commercial ultrasound scanners.  Anticipated Military Benefits/Potential Commercial Applications of the Research or Development:  The resulting beamformer will provide ten times the performance for 1/10 the cost of conventional designs.  Portable ultrasound scanners are thus feasible for use by combat medics in the battlefield and civilian emergency medical technicians.  Clinical ultrasound systems and portable ultrasound scanners for manufacturing lines will also be made feasible by this innovative CCD beamformer.",

The transceiver combines innovative direct-conversion analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters (ADCs/DACs) with a novel sample rate converter (SRC).  A 25 MHx signal bandwidth centered at up to 2 GHx can be generated or received directly from baseband inphase/quadrature (I/Q) digital data without analog IF conversion stages.

They promise lower threshold current, higher operating temperature. higher output power, and more tunability than other reported mid-R lasers, e. g., the GaInAs/AlInAs quantum cascade laser demonstrated by the AT&T group.

Current diode laser technology can bring these systems from the laboratory into practical use.  The results would be safer, more reliable and lower cost space launch operations and strategic and tactical missile ordnance systems.  The major task in reducing the technology to practice is to design a fail safe system that cannot unintentionally  function an ordnance event.  The resulting design(s) must be proven safe from analysis and test.  This effort proposes to evaluate alternative designs for safety and margin analysis on the design, breadboard critical circuit elements, and prepare a technical data package for Phase II fabrication and test.",

This effort places equal emphasis on the details of the nonlinear bonding dynamics of the elements comprising the dots. Nanotextured materials with nonlinear bonding dynamics develop energy localization phenomena that allow for selective excitation of vibrational modes that relax via the emission of visible light. Highly efficient and bright, hybrid semiconductor-organic electroluminescent (HSOE) devices can be fabricated in any given color by optimizing both properties. In current solid state light sources the semiconductor host must transport the electron hole pairs with high mobility and, in addition, must possess the proper band gap for the intended emission wavelength. These two properties are contradictory and result in limited efficiencies. In this effort the properties of charge transport and light emission have been decoupled such that the nonlinearly bonded nanodots are chelated to the surface of a sintered, nanotextured high mobility matrix. Electroluminescence (EL) emanates from these distributed emissive dots under 3 - 5 Volt dc making this approach immediately adaptable to TTL logic with pulse rates in excess of 100Hz. The simplicity of processing, low cost of materials and durability of the devices indicates that this nanometric EL approach is ideal for flat panel displays of arbitrary dimension.",

        "abstract": "Current focal plane array technology remains more expensive than the budgeted acquisition costs for many DOD systems. Even though DOD has spent millions of dollars to improve HgCdTe manufacturing technologies, it is now obvious that the projected manufacturing costs will never be achieved due to the complexity of the process with its associated poor yields. The higher resolution formats (greater than 256 x 256) required for the next generation staring systems are difficult to achieve due to the immature nature of this material system. Quantum Well Infrared Photodetector (QWIP) based on the III-V material system have been demonstrated to be attractive alternatives to the HgCdTe devices. The greater maturity of the III-V materials allow larger diameter wafers (100-150 mm) with excellent uniformity which allows the cost effective realization of higher resolution FPAs. The QWIP cost is still limited by the current technology required to integrate them into the cooler/dewar assembly. The process involving the bonding of the FPA to the silicon multiplexer chip has poor yields due to the complexity of the process. This proposed effort will attempt to address this issue by combining the GaAs based QWIP FPA on the same chip with a GaAs based multiplexer.",

Laboratory research has shown that NMR relaxation parameters are also diagnostic of integrity or damage in a variety of aerospace materials.  These materials include advanced composites, adhesives and sealants, binders and propellants.  NMR can detect moisture or fuels absorbed in composites, heat damage in composites, the state-of cure of adhesives and sealants, and the effects of aging in propellants.  The major obstacles to MRI as a routine tool in nondestructive evaluation (NDE) have been the high cost and complexity of MRI systems.  Quantum Magnetics, as a leader in the development of low-cost, easy-to-use NMR systems for a variety of applications, proposes to investigate the feasibility of a low-cost MRI system for the NDE of composite- based Navy systems.

We propose an improved metal detector which will detect, locate, and characterize non-ferrous ordnance at a standoff distance close to two meters.  The AC magnetic gradiometer (ACMG), will improve detection range by combining sensitive magnetic sensors with advance techniques of applied-field rejection.  The ACMG will locate and characterize targets by measuring all independant components of the magnetic response gradient, at varying frequencies and applied-field orientations.  This approach is an extension of our work with IBM on the room-temperature three-sensor gradiometer, a multicomponent magnetic gradiometer developed for the Navy.  During Phase I, we will delinate (1) the optimum frequency regime for target characterization, (2) the best sensor type, (3) the detection algorithms, (4) the design of a prototype metal dector, and (5) the detection range, size, weight, power consumption and cost of a field instrument.",

Total field magnetometers and gradiometers, although relatively unaffected by motion, require  extensive post processing of data. As a result, real time localization is not possible. Single axis  vector field gradiometers suffer from limited dynamic range and can not determine all the field tensor  components necessary for real time detection and location.  This program will develop a short baseline room temperature Three Sensor Gradiometer  (TSG)  sensor which will provide superior sensitivity and dynamic range with unequaled rejection of   motion noise.

The observables are the local variations in the soil radar reflectivity, and the eddy currents that can be induced by a metal detector (AN/PSS-12).  There are large variations in the constitutive properties of the soil caused by nature and large variations due to man made contamination (cans, shell fragments, cartridges, etc.) which compounds the detection process.  The detection of the M-14 , which is non-metallic and approximately 2 inches in diameter and 2 inches high, presents the severest detection challenge.  THe synergism of combining a metal detector with a ground penetrating radar improves the detection process and reduces the false alarms; however, the ratio of the M-14 induced signal to the earth surface return is very, very small as measured with current antenna systems.  QRC successfully demonstrated a height insensitive radar antenna with 5 inch diameter footprint integrated with the AN/PSS-12 that detected the M-14 ;mines at the HHMD ATD held at the Uma Proving Grounds.  Decreasing the footprint to a 2 inch diameter footprint would increase the probability of detection, and when arrayed could provide a substantial swath width.

        "abstract": "Performance benefits to systems employing an Electrically Steerable Antenna (ESA) are numerous.  Included are rapid beam scanning, beam agility, and the performance of multiple functions such as surveillance and target tracking.  These gains are obtained at the expense of large increases in system cost and weight.  For many space and aerostat applications, the classical ESA architecture of one T/R module per radiating element is too heavy.  Radant Technologies has developed a novel approach to beam steering that will likely meet the requirements of lightweight applications.  The Radant Lens achieves these requirements by eliminating costly and weighty features (discrete phase shifters, all packaging, interconnecting transmission lines, and connectors associated with each element, and reduction of control circuitry from N2 to 2N) of the classical ESA architecture.  This Phase I study will develop new Radant Lens based ESA designs that will achieve very large savings in weight, in comparison to the classical ESA.  The first objective will reduce the weight of the Radant Lens by 50% while maintaining electrical and mechanical performance.  Lightweight feeding options for the Radant Lens will also be examined.  Finally, experiments will be defined for a potential Phase II study that will verify Phase I performance predictions.",

To bridge different effective apertures of various optoelectronic devices are the major bottleneck needs to be overcome. Radiant Research, Inc., proposes a drastically new idea to solve this problem by introducing a mode-matched waveguide to significantly alleviate the existing coupling losses among various optoelectronic components. Based on our in-depth investigation. the compression-molded polymer waveguide proposed herein is the only solution to bridge huge dynamic range of different optoelectronic device depths. There is no other waveguide fabrication method that is capable of providing the waveguide depth needed to cover the required dynamic range of depth which may vary from few um to hundreds of um. The idea is aimed at providing a cost-effective, reliable and low-loss optoelectronic packaging. All the transparent optical polymeric (TOP) materials are either thermosetts or thermoplastics. Both can be molded into a specific shape as desired. It is therefore best-suited to integrate different optoelectronic devices with a different device size and spacing. In phase I we will demonstrate an optoelectronic packaging consisting of a multi-mode fiber and a single-mode waveguide with one order of magnitude improvement in packaging losses.",

There have been great advances in achieving high-frequency operation using phase reversal traveling-wave electrode structures.  However, the presence of phase-reversal configuration in the electrode requires the fabrication of specially-structured thick electrodes to reduce the microwave loss, which is extremely difficult in fabrication.  Moreover, these devices are polarization sensitive making the system integration difficult. A drastically new sub-nanosecond opto-electrical switch structure, based on a domain inverted wave guide directional coupler and a uniform traveling-wave electrode, is introduced, which will improve the switch performance in polarization insensitivity, switching speed, optical extinction ratio and polarization-insensitivity with a simplified fabrication scheme, leading to a higher reproducibility of the devices. Furthermore, employment of reliable opto-electrical polymer thin films (Dispersive Red 19 and LD-3 from Ad Tech) can be realized on any substrate of interest which significantly eases the implementation of the high speed optio-electrical switching devices for the US Navy's Optical truetime delay lines.

Water vapor is the most significant and most highly variable of greenhouse gases.  It is also the most significant and highly variable atmospheric constituent in the formation of weather and in the transfer of atmospheric heat.  Yet it remains one of the most poorly characterized of meteorological parameters.  In spite of their high cost, inaccuracy, and noncontinuous nature, radiosondes (RAOBs) are still the common method of profiling atmospheric water vapor. There are no all-weather remote sensing technologies in existence or in development that can remotely profile water vapor; other know technologies are defeated by the presence of cloud.  The inversion method proposed herein involves profiling the power spectrum received at the surface of a pressure broadened microwave water vapor emission line.  A prototype profiling radiometer is the built and operated in parallel with NWS (RAOB) releases.  We further propose to apply heretofore unexplored mathematical inversion methods to retrieve the vapor profile from the instrument observables.  We will employ several experts in several fields of mathematical inversions, including neural networking, iterative, and seismic inversion methods.  These methods will be tested for accuracy under a broad spectrum of atmospheric conditions using data from RAOB soundings as well as synthetic profiles.  This instrument will be capable of water vapor and temperature profiles along slanted (elevated) paths as well as zenith.",

        "abstract": "Currently, advanced tools for modeling injection modeling of thermoplastics and predicting formed part dimensional stability and residual stress content use the static bulk modulus of the polymer at the temperatures and pressures associated with the molding process.  The short cycle times associated with injection molding, however, could be more accurately modeled if dynamic bulk modulus data were available.  In addition, these data are critical for modeling of fracture and crack propagation in polymers, which forms the basis of strength and fracture analyses.  Unfortunately, commercial equipment is not available for measuring dynamic bulk moduli.  Therefore, development and design of a Dynamic Bulk Modulus/Pressure-Volume-Temperature (PVT) Apparatus will be addressed.  The device would be used to measure the dynamic bulk modulus of polymers over a frequency range of 0.1-5000 Hz at pressures of 0-200 Mpa, and temperatures of 25-315C, as well as perform PVT measurements over the same temperature and pressure range.  The apparatus will employ Terfenol-D, an advanced magnetostrictive material as the actuator used to oscillate the volume of a pressure vessel containing the sample and contrainment fluid.

Ultracapacitors, because of their high rate of charge and discharge, are prime candidates for use as the load-leveling power source in electric vehicles. The most important parameter in determining the power and energy density of a carbon-based ultracapacitor is the amount of surface area accessible to the electrolyte. Although considerable effort has been invested in making monolithic carbon materials with the desired pore size distribution for use in ultracapacitors, no high performance carbon materials have so far met the cost targets. In previous studies, monolithic porous carbons have been prepared with the correct pore size distribution for use in ultracapacitors. Phase I will prepare cells to evaluate the power and energy densities attainable with the new materials, and estimate their cost in large scale production.  The improvements should allow  the attainment of cost/performance targets that will make ultracapacitors commercially viable power sources.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  Capacitive power sources are currently used as backup power supplies for computers and similar devices. By lowering the cost of high-performance power cells, the materials developed in this project will have a significant near-term market.

        "abstract": "A fundamental component responsible for low bit error rate (BER) is the phase jitter of the frequency reference source, regardless if a network is wireless or fiber optic in nature.  In the case of wireless the frequency reference source is typically a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO), and in the fiber optic case it is a clock.  In order to maximize the full benefit of spread spectrum techniques, such as code division multiple access (CDMS), frequency hopping in secure communications, or allowing a high number of users to occupy the same frequency band , the BER must be kept to an acceptable level.  Phase I work will primarily concentrate on devloping and measuring prototype reference sources that can satisfy the phase jitter and phase noise requirements required by high speed digital wireless and fiber optic systems.  When defining a reference source, digital designers tend to specify phase jitter while RF engineers use phase noise.  Although phase jitter and phase noise are related, they are not interchangeable in a casual sense.  Therefore, part of Phse I will also be devoted to defining relationships between these parameters, allowing the reference sources developed to be characterized in a meaningful way.  Anticipated Military Benefits/Potential Commercial Applications of the Research or Development:  This effort will result in significantly better understanding of frequency reference sources capable of meeting phase noise and phase jitter performance requirements in dual use high digital data rate applications.  Prototype sources investigated in Phase I will result in commercially available sources in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Computer Based Training (CBT) systems have been shown to  promote high learning training effectiveness and cost  effectiveness.  To get effective training from these systems,  specific technical knowledge needs capturing.  Unfortunately,  the task of accessing the knowledge stored in the technicians  brains and recording this knowledge has remained difficult  and expensive.  The proposed work would attempt to automate the task of re-  trieving and storing technical data for use by CBT systems.  The \"Electronic Capture and Handling, Integrated Engineering  Facts\" (e-Chief) system would provide an effective method of  obtaining the knowledge from the individual and using it in  multiple, broad-based CBT applications, in a phased approach.  The e-Chief system would incorporate a cognitive science model  of knowledge elicitation.  The e-Chief system would incorporate  an Instructional Systems Design (ISD) model of training design.  Phase one has two objectives, First, to specify a system  design specification for the processes and tools required to  effectively transmit technical knowledge from a practitioner  to the computer data base.  Second, RDC would perform a  preliminary task analysis on a domain of the clients choosing  to test the data structures required to capture knowledge from  a technical expert.",

However, these are  expensive to develop.  Little is known about what types of tasks these best  train and how best to invest in them to maximize training objectives.  The  proposed work will develop a methodology for decomposing training tasks  into underlying knowledge components.  Research will then be done to  identify what features of multimedia technologies best train what knowledge  components.  From these data, a trade-off methodology can be developed that  calculates the costs associated with using different multimedia environments  to meet specified training objectives.

Expert systems and other rule-based system are a standard AI technique used to codify human expertise and reasoning capability n a form that a computer can use. However, large systems are typically too slow for many realtime applications. Reticular Systems proposes to solve this problem by developing a VLSI co-processor that will speed up such expert system processing by a factor of 10-1000 times. This increase in speed will open up many new real-time applications that require the intelligence of expert systems. Moreover, the similarity between the low level pattern matching of expert systems and the join process in large relational database searches indicate that this co-processor could be utilized in many database applications where getting the query results in as short a time as possible is critical. Reticular Systems experience in developing intelligent systems (both software and hardware) gives us the unique opportunity to develop and exploit this technology in both commercial and military markets.",

The fundamental challenge is to determine what  information to display, when to display it, where to display the information and how to display it.  Reticular Systems' business focus has been on developing methods for prioritizing and filtering information, presenting appropriate information in a timely manner and preventing information overload. We have identified a number of potential solutions which are based on our development of situation assessment systems for rotorcraft, intelligent operator assistants and intelligent agents for complex reasoning systems and real-time problem solving.  Solutions draw on results for the Air Force Pilot's Associate Program and recent finding in human information processing.

We will deliver prototype code, simulation results and a final report describing the overall landmark and location recognition system for autonomous navigation of robotic ground vehicles.

It is lightweight, compact, and consumes a minimum of electrical power.  It is potentially much more sensitive than micromachined components, with a wider dynamic range. Its signal processing is trivial in that it requires no crystal oscillator. In addition, an automotive-grade IORAS can be easily mass produced at low cost to meet the performance specifications of a military style inertial navigator.

        "abstract": "Frequency selective surfaces (FSSs) find widespread applications as radomes, dichroic filters and components for satellite antenna systems, and have been extensively investigated in the past.  Much of the attention in these studies has been focused, however, on the in-band performance of versions of these filters and little progress has been reported on the important aspect of RCS reduction, which requires an accurate modeling of the out-of-band scattering characteristics of the FSSs that can be either single or multi-layered, electrically thick, and spaced with dielectric layers whose parameters may vary from layer to layer. In this effort, we propose to carry out the development of computer codes based on the newly developed Genetic Algorithms applied in conjunction with general-purpose and computationally-efficient FSS analysis software developed over the last decade by RM Associates, that would simultaneously optimize the in-band transmission and out-of-band scattering characteristics of multi-layered frequency selective screens. In addition, truncation, curvature, transition and finite-thickness effects would be capability, that would require accurate computation of near fields, would be handled by codes specially adapted for this purpose.",

While the design of single microstrip patch antenna is relatively well developed, the same can not be said for arrays and antennas mounted on complex structures, especially at high frequencies where the quasi-static models are not accurate and, hence, commercially available tools, e.g. Touchstone cannot be sued for reliable design.  One of the important features of the deign tool will be the ability to extract equivalent circuits from the outputs of field solvers.  These solvers will be rendered efficient by using various techniques that will speed up the required computation.  the availability of equivalent circuits will enable us to employ optimization algorithms in a very efficient manner.  User friendly Graphic User Interface will be an integral part of the tool.  Phase-I will explore the various tools will also develop or refine them on as-needed basis to render them well-adapted for the present task.

        "abstract": "RM Associates (RMA) proposes to develop a novel approach to designing broadband antennas covering the frequency range of 15:1, or even greater, without sacrificing the gain and efficiency of the presently available designs which exhibit a narrower bandwidth. The design methodology will be based upon the newly developed genetic algorithm for solving stochastic optimization problems and is expected to yield greatly superior results than can be achieved by using conventional techniques.  We anticipate that the resultant designs would be useful for high speed, spread spectrum and frequency hopping communication systems because they would be able to meet the requirements that they be low profile, efficient, and offer simultaneous operation over a broad band of frequencies.  Phase I of the effort would involve the development of the genetic algorithm for broadband antenna design; demonstration of the application of the algorithm to a representative antenna of interest to the Navy; assessment of the feasibility of fabrication of the designed antenna; preliminary assessment of the suitability of the design antenna for shipboard environment.  RMA will be assisted in this effort by Parisi Antenna Systems who will consult with RMA and evaluate the feasibility of manufacturing the design antennas.  RMA will also consult with Booz-Allen & Hamilton who are experts in the field of shipboard communication systems.  Completion of the Phase I effort will allow for the development, in Phase II, of a full-scale and fully functional broadband antenna that can be installed and tested within the shipboard environment.",

Unfortunately current LADAR ranging techniques require an intense, focused beam that is mechanically scanned over a field of view. Mechanical scanning limits the data rate, is weight- and cost-prohibitive for many applications, and can be failure-prone. Scanned range imagery is also susceptible to motion-included distortion, and the high active emissions for scanned LADAR's are undesirable for covert applications and eye safe operation. These systems therefore do not meet the demanding performance requirements of critical military and commercial missions in reconnaissance, surveillance, target acquisition, navigation, and collision avoidance. Robotic Vision Systems, Inc. (RVSI) proposes to conduct a laboratory demonstration to verify the ability of its patented scannerless LADAR technology to acquire \"snapshot\" images without moving parts, while using eve safe active emissions This demonstration will provide the basis for development of a highly reliable system capable of capturing crisp, high resolution range images under the most demanding high speed, covert operations.",

Diffractive optical elements (DOEs) can also be used for the generation of fanout arrays, microlens arrays, anti-aliasing gratings, and polarization optics.  Applications include the fabrication of sports and military optics such as light-weight binocular eyepeices and rifle scopes, optical interconnects for communication systems, DOEs for HMDs, and fanout arrays for laser machining.  In order to capitalize upon the advantages diffractive optics has to offer over conventional optics, the technology for manufacturing high-quality, low-cost DOEs needs to be developed.   During Phase I we plan to investigate a novel method of fabrication durable diffractive optics replicas.  Currently, developed replication technologies result in a final diffractive surface that is polymer-based.  For applications involving high temperatures, long-term durability, or applications in the UV spectral region, plastic materials are not suitable.  The replication method we will investigate results in durable DOEs fabricated in substrated materials such as SiO2.  Unlike current fabrication processes whereby each element must be individually pattered via diamond turning or photolithographic techniques, the proposed replication method requires only a single master element to be fabricated in this manner.  Subsequent SiO2 elements are replicated from this master, resulting in lower element cost and in replicas that are durable and suited for multiple dual-use applications in the UV and visible regions of the spectrum.  Anticipated Military Benefits/Potential Commercial Applications of the Research or Development:  Non-plastic DOE replicas have dual-use applications in the UV and visible spectral regions.  Applications include UV lithography, laser machining, lightweight binocular eyepeices, and zoom lenses for camcorders.",

Such a solid-state transmitter array will also be capable of beam steering in order to keep the beam focused onto a rectenna (mounted to a moving platform) which will be capable of receiving and converting the microwave power into DC power.  Beam steering techniques that will either eliminate the conventional phase shifters or minimize their numbers in the phased arrays will be developed to make the WPT system more efficient and effective.  A rectenna design approaching 100% (RF to DC) conversion efficiency by retrieving the RF power from the higher order harmonics (generated in the rectifier circuits) will be pursued.

        "abstract": "Innovative concepts based on quasi-optial techniques for developing high performance solid-state devices at millimeter-wave frequencies are described.  Using a large number of low power two terminal or three terminal devices, active integrated antenna arrays tha tmeet the requirements of high power solid-state transmitter sources and beam steering capabilities are proposed.  Such power sources are more efficient, light weight, small and cost effective than the high power tubes.  Quasi-optical techniques are also capable of improving the dynamic range of mixers and low-noise amplifiers. The circuits can be realized in grid configurations using planar circuit topology which is compatible to future monolithic implementation for low cost production. In phase I, research activities will be focussed on developing these techniques and concepts.  A few prototype circuits will be fabricated and tested in order to verify the concepts.  Development, fabrication and production techniques for these high performance circuits will be addressed in Phase II.",

Reliance on incremental improvements in linear, fixed-point controllers as the means of implementing control of real-time systems has been a primary source of ever-increasing software costs associated with fielding new weapon systems.  Recent developments in adaptive control and robust multivariable control also fall short of the need for flexible integration of safety constraings and performance constraints for futrue combat systems.  Fuzzy logic and neural net controllers do not provide a means of integrating command and control logic with real-time control software.  This project will further develo9 the Multiple-Agent Hybrid Control Architecture (MAHCA) as a means to synchronize operation of the diverse system components being developed for future multi-platform, fire-on-the-move applications. This will result i the integration of previous results for single-agent precision stabilizatio and tracking control of a highly nonlinear plant with other results for multiple-agent modeling of the multi-platform engagement problem.",

Automated systems which interconnect, address, and control large numbers of distributed sensing and actuation elements (pressure sensors, shear sensors, microflaps, etc.) are key to the implementation of such \u00c2\u00bfsmart\u00c2\u00bf structures.  Fiberoptic technology shows promise for this application since many devices can potentially be multiplexed along single fibers, and the fibers may be easily integrated with structures.SRC has a technology for interfacing such devices with fiberoptic communication lines.  The fiberoptic interface is fabricated using SRC's proprietary cylindrical micro-fabrication technology and is much smaller than existing optical modulators.  The technique involves a microfabricated piezoelectric actuator on the optical fiber.  The actuator is used to modulate the light in the fiber to transmit data.  When SRC matures this technology, distributed networks of microdevices, such as pressure sensors or strain sensors, could be interconnected and addressed.  With our technology, a single optical fiber could be used to interconnect many microdevices and communicate their data to a central receiver at high data rates for each interface node.",

SASCO's system consists of opening the pyrotechnic device, removing the binder, the pyrophoric metals, the oxidizers, and recovering the metal salts. The outer casing of the device will be breached, and the binder will be dissolved.  Most binders are Viton material, which according to Naval Ordinance Systems Command Specifications #7682, is soluble in acetone. Other solvents can also be used to dissolve the binder and reclaim it as an elastomer.  Oxidizers such as sodium nitrate and potassium Perchlorate are soluble in organic liquids such as methanol.  Physical separation techniques will separate and recover individual magnesium and aluminum metals without alteration.  Copper, strontium, and other metal salts will be dissolved and recrystallized.  SASCO has experience in solvent extraction and ion exchange if such techniques are required.  SASCO will create a safe, environmentally acceptable, economically viable, and technically successful project by employing as few steps as possible to separate-components into pure forms.

This will create a standardized set of rotating  power modules with common electrical and coolant interfaces.             As Navy power  distribution systems evolve to DC bus architecture, the power electronics-driven cost  disadvantage of PMVSDs will be reduced.  The reduction in start-up current surge and  higher efficiency of PMVSD operation will also reduce cost, while reduced motor start-  up current should decrease submarine power distribution system size and capacity  requirements.  In Phase I SatCon will study the cost and performance impact of introducing PMVSD  technology into submarine auxiliary systems, and will determine the applications likely  to benefit from its introduction.  These results will be analyzed to estimate impact  of this technology on a typical submarine, and on overall fleet operations.  SatCon  will generate a preliminary PMVSD design for a significant candidate submarine  application.   SatCon proposes an option to consider variable speed induction motor  drives for comparison.  These design data will be used to validate and update initial  predictions of cost and performance impact on submarine operation.         Based on the  expectation that PMVSD technology offers significant overall benefit, in Phase II  SatCon will generate detailed PMVSD designs for representative submarine applications,  identified as significant to fleet cost effectiveness during Phase I.

SatCon has developed and analyzed a conceptual design of a permanent magnet which is roughly 10 inches long by 23 inches i diameter.  Initial analyses indicate that it can achieve 300 kW over an operating speed of 400-3600 rpm, while maintaining an efficiency of better than 93% down to 400 rpm.  At 400 rpm and 300 kW the machine is producing 5280 ft-lbs. and, therefore, is achieving a torque density of 2200 ft-lbs./ft(3).  the high efficiency of the motor and the absence of a gearbox allows overall efficiency of the motor and electronics to exceed 90% over the entire speed range.  At speeds above 400 rpm the same power is achieved at even better efficiency, since the required torque falls off.  Since the maximum power capability remains constant at 300 kW over the speed range, the terminal voltage required for maximum power need not change with speed.  THis approach, known a field weakening, is commonly used with DC and induction motors.  The phase I will proceed through requirements definition, design tradeoffs, and detail design to arrive at a optimum design which would be built and tested in a phase II.  Emphasis will be given to efficiency, torque production and control, thermal management, control/commutation of phase currents, and drive inverter design and performance.",

        "abstract": "Magnetic bearings will dramatically improve performance of gas turbine engines by permitting high rotor speeds and combustion temperatures.  Lubrication systems are also eliminated, reducing weight and logistic support.  These huge potential benefits are essential to the Integrated High Performance Turbine Engine Technology Program (IHPTET).  SatCon Technology Corporation's magnetic bearings have been tested to 36,000 RPM under contract with the Army's Power Systems Division.  However, several key issues remain.  No magnetic bearing system (MBS) has auxiliary bearings and control software that allow touchdown and recovery at engine operating speeds of 50,000 RPM, or is built with high temperature materials that will withstand 1,100F.  In addition, actuators and power electronics must be designed for low losses and minimal power dissipation.  In Phase I, SatCon will perform the initial analyses necessary to design a MBS that can satisfy the JTAGG II and III operating environment.  This design will address the key remaining issues. An integral part of this design effort will be test and validation on an existing gas turbine test rig, upgraded to operate at the JTAGG II speed of 50,000 RPM in Phase II.  Phase III will entail combining SatCon's magnetic and auxiliary bearing configurations with a JTAGG II or III engine.",

        "abstract": "SatCon Technology Corporation proposes to develop the next generation power controller module aimed at the integrated control and power functions desired for the Power Electronics Building Block (PEBB) which has broad goverment and commercial interest.  Building on power hybrid technology advances made by SatCon during participation in Chrysler Corporation's \"Patriot\" Hybrid Electric Race Car Program, SatCon Proposes to reduce the integrated power controller package size by an order of magnitude by combining the power and control electronics into a single module.  SatCon's efforts on the \"Patriot\" Program resulted in packaging densities of 20 kW per  pound and 440 watts per cubic inch, which compare quite favorably to the prior stat-of-the-art which was approximately 1/4 of these levels.  The proposed approach further integrates and simplifies the power and control electronics design and results in a building block amenable to a wide variety of power levels.  Anticipated Military Benefits:  The development of compact, modular electronic power controller drive systems provides a broad enabling technology base for a variety of military applications including electric and hybrid tactical vehicles, more-electric aircraft, and shipboard integrated power systems.  Similar benefits for commercial applications within the automotive, machine tool, process and utility idustries offer the promise of the high volume production and reduced cost necessary to foster broad implementation.",

A broad spectrum of flywheel energy storage (FES) systems will be covered by these developments, ranging from low cost/moderate performance to high performance composite rotors.

This project will decrease manufacturing costs by developing new fabrication techniques for rotor assemblies and thinly laminated stator stacks.  The rotor assembly concept involves using an innovative bonding technique to assemble a net-shape copper squirrel cage to a net-shape magnetic core.  The laminated stack concept involves using an advanced spray-forming process to fabricate cores of arbitrarily thin laminations in a one-step process.  Phase I will demonstrate the feasibility of using these techniques to make electric motors with a performance-to-cost ratio that will make them economically viable, thus bringing electric automobiles another step closer to reality.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  Most applications that use rotating machinery or require high power-to-weight ratios can enjoy an efficiency improvement through higher rotational speeds.  Electric vehicles and next-generation high-speed turbo machines (e.g., HVAC compressors) are the nearest-term and largest market applications for cost-effective, high-performance electric motors.",

The uniqueness of this concept is vested to the type of detector mechanism selected, and specifically the mounting technique and the geometry of the detector proper.  No moving parts are envisioned for the detector mechanisms; thus, the concept is valuable in regard to the required large acceleration effected to the projectile at the time of launch. The receiver/seeker/detector mechanism will be optimized to operate with an Erbium laser transmitter, in order that the system qualifies as \"eye-safe.\" The work described in this proposal will utilize the advantages of the simplicity of Er:Glass and mitigate the disadvantages with innovative technologies.

        "abstract": "This proposal is part of a TRP whose aim is the development and commercialization of a generic 2 micrometers coherent lidar transceiver with a variety of airborne wind sensing applications in both commercial and military avionics.  These include: flight-level-optimization, clear-air turbulence detection, wind shear detection and avoidance, and wake-vortex detection.  For specifiec military use, applications include: gunship wind sensing and wind mapping for precision air and bomb drop missions.  A central feature of the lidar system is the laser transmitter, whose preliminary specifications are >10 mJ pulse energies, pulse repetition rate of 200 Hz , and a pulse duration of greater than 400 ns.  TEM00-singel frequency operation is a prerequisite, and the system must operate in an ambient temperature of up to 55 degrees C with a maximum power budget of 500W.  The compact, rugged transceiver must be air-cooled to simplify installation and maximize lifetime.  This SBIR program proposes to demonstrate the above laser performance on a breadboarded system, basing its design on an existing Tm,Ho:YLF laser.  We intend to investigate cooling schema capable of maintaining the defined performance in an airborne environment and within the defined power budget.  The results of this embeded SBIR program will provide invaluable input to the associated TRP.  Anticipated Military Benefits:  A generic coherent airborne lidar system will porovide wind sensing data for closed loop correction of gunship targeting, allowing incresed stand-off.  Wind mapping of air-space under aircraft will enhance precison air and bomb drop missions.  Use of this technology in commercial (and military) avionics would provide fuel savings (via flight level optimization) and increased passenger safety (via clear-air-turbulence, wind shear and wake vortex detection).",

        "abstract": "The main objective of this proposal is to design and develop an all-solid-state, high repetition rate laser source, tunable throughout the 1.5 to 3.5 um wavelength range. The proposed source will have a peak power greater than 1 kW at multi-kHz repetition rate. It will be based upon an optical parametric oscillator (OPO), and provides the wide tuning range by utilizing a pump source which is also widely tunable - a diode-pumped Cr:LiSAF laser. This unique device utilizes an OPO with a low threshold that allows use of diode-pumped laser. Specific aims of the Phase I effort include an investigation of a range of newly available efficient Arsenate nonlinear optical materials, KTA, CTA and RTA that have transmission out to 5 um. Experiments will be performed using a high pulse energy tunable pump laser, to demonstrate OPO oscillation in these crystals, and to establish their threshold pump energy requirement.  We will also demonstrate the broad tunability achieved by using a tunable pump source.  Finally, the design of phase II high pulse energy (2-3mJ), tunable (780-1000nm) Cr:LiSAF pump laser will be carried out.  In phase II the miniature mid-IR OPO pumped by the diode-pumped tunable laser will be fabricated and tested.",

        "abstract": "In the present domestic and world political climate, U.S. military forces are faced with situations requiring less-than-lethal response options.  Low-energy lasers can be effective, non-lethal weapons for a variety of military missions and law enforcement applications.  Through the effects of illumination, glare, flashblinding and psychological impact, lasers can create surrender, hesitation, delay, distractions, temporary visual impairment, and reductions in combat and functional effectiveness. Furthermore, these effects can be created at eye-safe exposure levels below the maximum allowed by international safety standards.  SEA proposed the exploratory development of four laser concepts that provide the individual soldier or law enforcement officer with a range of non-lethal response options employing existing hardware and weapon systems.  These are a flashlight laser, a baton laser, a shotgun shell laser, and a grenade shell laser.  During Phase I, SEA will evaluate these four concepts relative to Army mission requirements.  Based on this evaluation, on of the concepts will be selected for Phase I development and tested as a demonstrator prototype.  If the project is selected for a Phase II SBIr, SEA will take one or more of the four concepts through advanced development and provide the Army with several fieldable prototypes for testing in operational situations.",

Radiation curing of fiber-reinforced polymer composites, paints, adhesives and sealants can offer processing and cost advantages over conventional materials.  Radiation curable paints are solvent-free, an environmental, health and safety and advantage and cure quickly (< 1 minute).  Recent advances in UV and EB curing systems and in radiation-curable chemistry formulations have made it possible to achieve weatherable UV and EB curable paints for aircraft.  Advances in UV and EB curing systems include portable, high intensity sources with low capital costs.  Chemistry advances include recently available oligomers, photoinitiators, synergists and UV stabilizers.  Science Research Laboratory (SRL) has developed a new generation of electron beam acccelerators and pulsed UV systems for curing of polymer matrix composites and radiation curable coatings.  Electron accelerators include portable electron guns for curing of paints and coatings and high energy accelerators for curing of thick-section composites.  The portable electron guns use commercially available power supplies to reduce selling costs to under $100,000.  High energy accelerators and pulsed UV systems utilize all solid-state high repetition rate pulsed power drivers which reduce the capital cost while increasing system reliability.  A program is proposed to develop a radiation-curable aircraft painting system, including optimized materials and processing equipment.  Phase I inculdes material optimization and system design.  A portable curing system based on the Phase I design will be delivered during Phase II.

The materials development portion of the program   will involve studies of the use of photoionization, color center   formation, charge trapping and transfer, and combinations of these   processes for ions in crystalline materials.  The general approach   is to use a two step process in which the first step allows for the   absorption of high intensity laser radiation and the second step   provides the recovery mechanism for the material.  The first step   will involve the photoionization of transition metal ions to create   absorbing color centers in an appropriate host lattice.  The second   step will be the reduction of a second dopant ion removing the   color centers.",

        "abstract": "The firm proposes to develop an advanced software capability for the control and monitoring of turbine engines.  This effort is aimed at the near-term deployment of ensuing technologies on a low-cost helicopter engine.  The effort will be embedded in the T800 engine commercialization project led by the Allison Engine Company.  The reasons for the high cost of engine controls are two fold: first, redundant components increase costs; and second, engine-specific implementation and designs increase non-recurrent costs.  Hence, to lower the cost of control systems, we need to reduce the number of redundant components and make the control adaptable to a broader range of engine applications.  The approach taken to reduce cost while maintaining operability is to develop the control systems based on software (or analytical) redundancy.  Software redundancy is a model-based control/monitoring paradigm, which is consisted of an embedded, real-time, physical model of the engine and a smart, flexible, robust decision mechanism.  The goals of the model-based control are to provide functional operations in case that the primary digital control channel fails (or is switched off), and to perform fault identification, fault accommodation, and life usage manegement for the engine.  Anticipated Military Benefits:  The benefits will be to reduce control system weight and cost, and to increase engine operability and performance.  The technology can be applied to engines, airplanes, unmanned vehicles (UAVs), and ground transportation systems.  Military applications are T800 engine (the Comanche helicopter), T700 engine (Black Hawk helicopter), and other turbine engines used by a wide range of military vehicles.  Commercial applications are Allison 250, A2100, T800,  and other commercial turbine engines.",

These precursor algorithms and signal processing techniques, combined with flight qualified static pressure transducers, have shown promising results for sensing.

The nonlinear Moore-Greitzer model of rotating stall, which has proven useful for both simulation of rotating stall/surge dynamics of axial compression systems and for control design studies, will be utilized to develop new nonlinear control architectures.  The program will be specifically targetted for quick transition to commercial applications in two ways.  First, concepts which utilize a limited number of actuators, and/or utilize actuators which are \"ganged\" together to provide mechanical simplicity, will be developed, so that implementation risks and costs will be reduced.  Second, cooperation with engine manufacturers (GE, Pratt and Whitney) and NASA Lewis during phase II will allow experimental implementation of the proposed concepts.  Three concepts which have yet to be exploited in the arena of rotating stall/surge control will be explored.  First, non-axisymmetric placement of a limited number (1 or 2) of high-capacity actuators promises to reduce complexity while maintaining controllability of rotating stall modes.  Second, such placement can be specifically designed to improve the distortion tolerance of the compression system.  Finally, treating the distortion problem as a nonlinear disturbance-rejection problem allows the full power of nonlinear control design techniques to be brought to bear.  Previous work by Scientific System, MIT (Greitzer, Paduano, Epstein) and Dr. Abed in the fields of Bifurcation Analysis, System Identification and Stochastic Robust Control will be used to solve these problems.

Integrator  wind-up protection (IWP) is particularly critical with STOVL control law design  problem because the system is so often operating on limits (thrust and  vectoring limits) in powered-lift flight.  The same situation exists with current  Navy Fighters such as F-18 E/F during operation at high angles-of-attack.   Complicating factors are (i) the compensators often have a large number of  states and (ii) the control law needs to operate on numerous control effectors.

At low frequencies and long wavelengths, most of the scatters are in the Rayleigh scattering region and their RCS is low, which enables foliage penetration.  However, this also results in a small number of large scatterers on target of interest.  Automatic Target Recognition and Detection (ATR/D) using FOPEN SAR needs to utilize higher dimensional features such as polarization, absolute intensity, angle-diversity, frequency-diversity and other multi-kernel attributes of SAR imagery.  In addition, since the resolution at low frequencies is degraded, super resolution techniques hold great promise for enhancing ATR performance.  There is also a great need for dimensionality reduction in the design of ATR algorithms since the use of higher dimensional attributes results in multidimensional target templates.  In this proposal, we describe an efficient ATR approach based on the use of eigentemplates which have been found to be very successful in face recognition and have been shown recently to be close to full template matching in SAR ATR performance.  The specific Phase I technical objectives are: 1. aquisition of UWB FOPEN SAR simulated and real data. 2. Resolution enhancement using multidimensional Super resolution algorithms. 3. Development of Eigentemplates and associated ATR algorithms using higher dimensional target attributes. 4. Testing and evaluation of Supper resolution and ATR algorithms on simulated and real data.

This is an expensive approach which does not make use of analytical redundancy present in a flight control system.  Analytical redundancy is achieved by comparison of sensor outputs over time and across sensors using physical and identified models.  We propose here methods to detect failures using analytic redundancy and to compensate for these failures by reconfiguration of the control systems.  The proposed innovation for UAV reconfigurable flight controls builds on the previous work by Scientific Systems and other companies under the sponsorship of AF on the Self-Repairing Control Systems for F-15 and integrates recent developments in the fields of Systems Identification, Robust Control and Neural Networks.  Phase I will involve the following major tasks: (i) failure detection and identification using Neural Networks and on-line parameter identification (ii) reconfigurable controller design using robustcontrol theory and (iii) implementation and testing using Bell's Eagle Eye UAV simulation.

These contacts will be crucial to the develop of continuous-wave nitride-based laser devices, high-power blue and green light emitting diodes, and high-power bipolar GaN electronic devices. Semiconductor lasers require current densities of ~1kA/cm(2). With current GaN contact technologies this drive current density leads to extremely high drive voltages, causing excessive heat generation and currently preventing anything but pulsed laser operation. The technique described in this proposal will enable the operation of efficient semiconductor laser diodes in the 350-450 nm range. These laser diodes will find applications in high density data storage, advanced color printing, solar-blind communication, submarine communication and general displays. In addition, electronic components will greatly benefit from this contact technology via a reduction in power consumption and lower RC time constants, thus improving high-speed operation.",

After performance and cost models are used to compare the three candidates the last stage of the design evaluation will include an FMECA to MIL-STD 1629.    A final design will be chosen, possibly integrating features of preliminary designs.     From this integrated design a prototype will be fabricated and testing at the assembly and full article level begun.

A two-team approach to HV and HC designs, later integrated to a final design, will be used.    Design support models include finite element analysis (structural and heat) electrical capacity (including corona potential), and materials and reliability models.  The HC application, at 100,000 amperes, is a technology leap in underwater applications.    Heat dissipation concepts may have to include fluid cooled cable systems in a manner similar to that used by the smelting industry to melt steel and aluminum.

It is solid-state, high-speed, with high optical throughput and reads in two-dimensions. Its precise beam, tracking, pointing and reporting, its low cost and its visible-through-infrared capability make it unique in its field. Its specifications after the phase I work is completed would be: scan angle, > 15  in two dimensions, two-dimensional beam pointing accuracy, < 10 micro-radians; scan speed, > lOKHz and 200 frames per second; optical power throughput, > lOO's of watts, co-linear transmit and receive optics; operable at 1.5 microns; capable of computer control and reporting of beam position; mass-producible; and with a shelf life > 2 years. The goals of phase I are to improve the maximum scan range and pointing accuracy of our innovative, two dimensional prototype scanning technique.

The proposed work includes conception of additional ship types, analysis of all potential candidates, and selection of the most-promising ship type.  The most-promising ship concept will be analytically explored in sufficient depth to determine technical feasibility; if technically feasible, a plan will be proposed for further research and development.",

        "abstract": "Open burning/open detonation (OB/OD) operations for the disposal of obsolete, defective, and waste military energetic materials, such as propellants, explosives, and pyrotechnics now require emissions data to support RCRA subpart X permit applications.  Many of the current analytical methods used to obtain these data, such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and supercritical fluid chromatography/mass spectrometry, must be conducted off-site by specialized laboratories.  There is a need for the development of a real-time analytical technique for monitoring trace chemical vapor emissions during OB/OD testing in a BangBox facility.  In this study, we propose to develop such a system based on radiofrequency plasma ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry.  The time-of-flight analyzer is based on a patented orthogonal acceleration geometry which provides improved resolution and sensitivity over the more typical linear geometry.  The radiofrquency ionization source should provide ionization for a wide variety of chemical vapor species.  The objectives of this Phase I proposal are to perform preliminary evaluation of a radiofrequency plasma ion source for production of ions from target analytes detected in previous OB/OD operations, and analysis with a time-of-flight mass spectrometer previously constructed for inductively coupled plasma/mass spectrometry, with the final goal of designing a prototype system to be constructed in Phase II for testing OB/OD operations at the Dugway Proving Ground BangBox facility.",

This project will determine the feasibility of using carefully prepared metal oxide films to provide a small, low-power, inexpensive and accurate means to measure NOx concentrations with high reliability and repeatability.  Conductivity measurements will be made of doped and undoped tungsten oxide (WO3) films exposed to known concentrations of NO and NO2 at a variety of temperatures, in a variety of oxygen concentrations, and in the presence of several interferant gases. Conclusions will be drawn as to the optimum temperature(s) at which each film should be operated to attain maximum sensitivity and selectivity, what role oxygen plays in the sensor response, and how selective the films are to NOx compared to other combustion exhaust gases.  Phase II efforts will focus on the development of a compact, rugged, inexpensive, commercially viable sensor to make in situ measurements of NOx concentrations in automotive exhaust streams.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee: This project should result in a new generation of highly sensitive, highly selective, low cost and portable sensors with numerous immediate and long term applications within the federal government, automotive industry and other private sectors.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this GPS Antenna study is to investigate an innovative replacement for a Controlled Radiation Pattern Antenna (CRPA) which is cost effective and light weight, in a size similar to the existing Fixed Radiatio Pattern Antenna (FRPA).  Physically large CRPA antenna systems prohibit universal installation to restrictive platforms such as helicopters and smaller fixed wing aircraft.  The CRPA antenna can be effective against hostile jammers but is very costly to purchase and maintain, marking it impractical for the Army to equip large numbers of small aircraft, helicopters and ground vehicles.  sensor Systems believes it is possible to provide anti-jam capability in a FRPA sized antenna. Other antenna designs presently being implemented by Sensor Systems for satellite communications employ adaptive beam steering, internal active and passive signal conditioning.  Antenna beam steering and signal processing technologies may be used to improve the GPS signals which are contaminated by hostile jamming.  Under combat conditions, broad-band and narrow-band jammers may be used to contaminate GPS signals, denying GPS operations in battle zones. With established technology, a small, anti-jam, signal processing antenna can be developed to provide US Army battlefield commanders continuous use of GPS systems.",

        "abstract": "The extension of the proposed DUAL LIDAR system from laboratory to aircraft environment will be critically dependent on the performance of the optical bench/structure.  This optical bench must support all components (telescope, scanner, lasers, resonator, beam steering optics, and detector) while maintaining critical alignment of the single-mode, heterodyned laser system.  Specifically, the structure must maintain sub-0.1 milliradian level tolerances in the presence of thermal loads, gradients and drift, aircraft vibration, and varying gravitational loads; all while meeting strict weight requirements.  SSG's success developing light weight, inherently athermal optical systems from bulk SiC forms the basis for the proposed innovation: creation of the DUAL LIDAR optical bench from a new fibrous weave SiC form (a continuous fiber reinforced composite).  This weave SiC retains the advantages of the bulk material:  low CTE, high thermal conductivity, and excellent thermal stability (>12X aluminum); while adding high damping (>10X aluminum), ultra-light weight (density = 60% of aluminum, modulus >2X aluminum), and excellent fracture toughness (can be dropped on a cement floor).  Furthermore, the weave offers near-net shape fabrication for significant cost saving potential.  In Phase I, SSG proposes to analyze, design, fabricate, and test a prototype optical bench/structure for the DUAL LIDAR system.  This innovation will enable the airborne DUAL LIDAR system to satisfy rigid, ultra-light weight, thermally stable and durable airborne and UAV applications.  Anticipated Military Benefits:  LIDAR military applications: bomb drop, precision air drop, gunship ballistic winds correction, shipboard sensing and avoidance of turbulence.  Commercial LIDAR applications:  optimizing fuel savings, clear air turbulence detection.  Non-LIDAR military applications:  laser communication systems, active/passive target detection and tracking systems (e.g. EAGLE/AWACS), battlefield biological/chemical detection systems.  Non-LIDAR commercial:  Air/UAV and space-borne remote sensing systems, light weight, highly damped structural assemblies for microlithograpghy, CNC machining.",

Land mines kill or maim 26,000 people per year, often long after military actions cease.  The most common detection method--metal detection-- is increasingly ineffective for state-of-the-art antipersonnel mines, yet no consistently reliable, real-time alternative exists.  To combat this, new detection technologies that detect the chemical signature of the vapor emanating from the explosive material have been suggested.  Sensoria proposes a microelectromechanical system that is selective to specific vapors and provides continuous monitoring of the surrounding environment.  The technology will not require sophisticated user knowledge for result interpretation and could be designed as a low-power, hand-held device.  Our goal is to provide a technology that will be sufficiently selective to distinguish explosive vapor from a complex matrix of potential interferents and that will be sufficiently sensitive to provide real-time detection of trace-level vapor concentrations.",

        "abstract": "When radiation is the primary mechanism controlling temperature, both the solar absorption and the radiation must be controlled.  One method to change the radiated energy is to change the emissivity near the peak of this radiation.  If the internally generated heat varies, active control on this emissivity is necessary which must be coupled with additional control on the energy absorbed from solar radiation. This proposal provides this active control with a new and novel approach.  It provides independent switching of the LWIR emissivity and the visible absorption.  This dual control gives a degree of thermal control previously unattainable. The approach is based on an electrophoretic/electrochromic system with a special pigment to minimize absorption in the binder.  The approach will have minimal power consumption and has calculated changes in the emissivity from .4 to .85, (averaged from .2 to 15 microns) independent of changes in solar absorption. Changing the emissivity in the IR will control the radiated heat from a surface, allowing the system to adjust for internal varying loads while the active switching of the visible radiation will control solar loading.",

The proposed system has high shielding effectiveness against magnetic waves but with a much higher saturation field than any single component material.  In addition, this high shielding occurs with a relatively low permeability band will have minimal effect on the efficiency of rail guns.  This performance will be demonstrated during the phase I program by analysis, fabrication and measurement.  During the program, films will be deposited onto various composite materials.  Changes in the percentage of the various layers will be used to produce a highly flexible material suitable for various shielding applications, from rail guns to containers.

        "abstract": "GPS provides time to within 100 ns on a global basis. There exists an opportunity for using GPS to provide a global clock and create an innovative, inexpensive wireless Wide Area Network for efficient communication between mobile platforms. Shawn Systems is proposing to integrate GPS and computer networking technology through an RF medium that can create a host of new and innovative applications. Besides routine message handling, we have given two detailed application examples of how the system responds to unanticipated changes such as Collision Avoidance and Identification of Friend or Foe. This proposal uses three different technologies, viz. GPS, RF telemetry link and a Computing engine, in a unique combination that each of these technologies cannot provide by themselves. Use of COTS components will ease acquisition and lower the cost. Some or all of these technologies are present on a mobile platform, will help make this powerful combination affordable. We have received excellent input from industry and academia and we are seeking government funding/involvement in promoting this network. We have faculty from MIT and UMASS advising us on areas of Aviation Safety and Radio Networks. Our partners in industry, viz. Northrop-Grumman Corp., Raytheon, and Metric Systems Corp. have endorsed our research work, and they will help us in commercialization of the technology. We will also be bringing our expertise in fault tolerance to make the network highly reliable.",

The joints will be located in high pulsed magnetic fields which will induce losses in the conducting media of the joint and in the superconducting cable itself. These losses add to the required refrigeration power and can in extreme cases threaten the thermal stability of the superconducting cable. Traditional approaches cannot take into account the three dimensional complexity of 1000+ strand cables and the nonlinearity of the conductivity.  This project will use asymptotic expansions to calculate the coupling losses in the superconducting cable.  A new algorithm will be developed to determine the position of individual strands within a cable of over 1000 strands.  The implementation of this algorithm will generate a new tool to aid in the design and analysis of joints in superconducting cables. \n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  The ability to rapidly design and analyze electrical joints in superconducting cables will allow for more robust designs, decreased losses in magnet systems, and increased savings in refrigeration costs. The results could be used to tailor joint geometry and material to specific applications and to specific magnetic field environments.",

        "abstract": "The primary objective of the proposed project is to demonstrate through detailed simulation, performance and low-cost feasibility of SICOM's innovative rapid-acquisition digital data (RADD) demodulator for high data rate burst or CW communications.  The demodulator incorporates several innovative features, including zero-preample determination of symbol timing, carrier phase, and carrier frequency for coherent demodulation, a unique carrier-insensitive symbol-timing alignment algorithm, and powerful concatenated coding techniques combining rotationally-invariant pragmatic trellis-coded modulation (inner code), and Reed-Solomon coding (outer code).  Feasibility assessment, based on simulations and studies described in this proposal includes evaluation of the design versus existing and planned burst communication links, determination of the effectiveness of coding and interleaving and synchronization, achievement of coherence of the first bit, and \"burst learning curves\" of BER versus time from burst-start.  Secondary objectives of the project include preparation of specifications for a modem to be designed and fabricated in Phase I, including an ASIC implementation of a RADD demodulator, and definition of a detailed implementation plan for Phase II and III.  As currently envisioned, the RADD demodulator will accommodate QPSK, 8PSK, and 16QAM, will support 155 Mbps data links, and achieve a 10 to the 10th bit-error-rate with a 7 dB SNR.  Anticipated Military Benefits:  The proposed project will directly benefit the DoD's development of a global, survivable communications system integrated with commercial worldwide communications.  These communications will include 155 Mbps wireless links which will utilize ATM cell-based (burst) technology toward which the RADD modem is targeted.  For the tactical battlefield, it is vitally important to transmit and receive data with burst transmissions at high rates; the associated features of low-probability-of-detection and anti-jam operation are crucial for survival.

The development of successful RFI suppression techniques for UWB radars is crucial for their operation in many geographical areas.  In this proposal we outline several advanced RFI suppression techniques for UWB-SAR, which will be developed and evaluated during the Phase I project.  We consider three specific approaches.  The first involves modification of the existing class of RFI suppression techniques which use a time-invariant transversal filter.  We propose several ways to modify the computation of the filter coefficients, to provide better control of the filter response and minimize signal distortion.  The second is based on the application of advanced time-frequency analysis to the collected SAR data prior to image formation, to identify/detect features of the received signal which are related to RFI, and then remove/suppress these features using a time-varying filter.  The third is a relatively new approach which seems to be quite promising for processing non-stationary signals.  This approach, which involves nonlinear processing is based on the recently developed idea of wavelet de-noising, which offers a new way for separating a signal into components which have different characteristics.  Our objective is to develop RFI suppression algorithms based on each of these approaches, evaluate their performance, and assess their cost/benefit tradeoffs.",

        "abstract": "To obtain high quality or multi-spectral imagery from moving airborne platforms power- ful processing techniques are employed to remove the effects of aircraft forward velocity. A dynamically moveable imaging system which compensates for aircraft motion would greatly simplify these corrective requirements, and allow post processing systems to focus on target identification rather than \"cleaning up\" images.  Low light levels encountered in airborne reconnaissance missions typically require the use of an image intensifier which not only degrades image quality, but increases the mass of the camera system. This large mass makes it difficult or impossible to compensate for motion and platform vibration beyond a few 10's of hertz.  An imaging solution is needed which combines the high optical sensitivity needed for reconnaissance with the low mass needed to perform dynamic motion correction. SMD proposes to develop a motion compensated airborne imaging system for multispectral imaging applications.  The camera system utilizes a unique, high-gain CCD to achieve sensitivity over 1000 times higher than conventional CCD's, but without the need for a bulky image intensifier unit.  Since the new CCD sensor element is no larger than a postage stamp, dynamic correction for aircraft forward motion and vibration can easily be accomplished through electromechanical means.

        "abstract": "SMD proposes the design and fabrication of a two-dimensional APD array.  A novel APD array is proposed which requires low bias voltages, thus making it compatible with both CMOS and CCD multiplexer designs.  The on-chip CMOS/CCD circuitry will allow for multiplexing of a large number of pixels to a single output. Further, each pixel in the APD array will have its own range detection circuitry allowing for time-of-flight measurements on a pixel by pixel basis for potentially very large arrays.  Quantum efficiency of the APD array will be enhanced in the infrared range through the deposition of a unique coating on the surface of the silicon.  When the coating is exposed to infrared radiation, a visible orange secondary emission is observed.  Thus, the coating converts infrared energy into a wavelength more compatible with silicon APD detection.  The combination of the novel low voltage APD design with the wavelength converting coating will result in a new generation of high performance APD arrays.  Under Phase I, SMD proposes to experimentally demonstrate key components of the proposed concept Phase II will result in a fieldable 25x25 APD array with on-chip range detection circuitry and enhanced IR sensitivity.",

This technology must be fast enough to support high speed manufacturing processes used in the field.  Simpex Technologies proposed approach combines low power, high sensitivity laser ultrasonic technology with high speed targeting technique, to measure (quantitatively) the attachment integrity of bonded materials such as diamond like hard coating on polymeric substrates.  Simply, our Laser Ultrasonic Measurement Sensor represents an automation of the classical \"tap test\" in which an object is struck in some fashion and an experienced listener determines the adhesion integrity from the sound generated.   This technique is much improved from the traditional ultrasonic / acoustic techniques.  The object need not be contacted, the excitation is much gentler than that required in a contact test, and the whole approach lends itself to automation.  This sensor technology is expected to monitor minute material propagation with a precision of 0.2 angstroms at a speed of 250 nanoseconds.  Preliminary calculation indicates that the proposed non-contact, non-destructive system, mapping of 2,304 test pints on a 4'x 4' panel, will take less than 1 minute.  By correlating our ultrasonic propagation signal against current bond strength measurement methods quantitative bonds strengths can be interpreted by non-contact means and in real-time.",

Negative electron affinity property of the diamond surface had been reported previously. However, this exceptional super-high brightness electron emission behavior is believed to be a new mechanism due to the composite structure of cesium, oxygen and carbon. The high turn-on voltage has been a major hurdle for the field emitter to be widely used in Flat Panel Display (FPD) market. Experts anticipate that the field emitter FPD will overwhelm today's Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) FPD market if the turn-on voltage gets down to less than 5 V/micron. SKION's new findings will provide a breakthrough in the FPD industry. This novel structure is believed to be formed due to the characteristics of SKION's unique patented ion beam technology; capable of controlling flux ratio of cesium/carbon and the energy of the carbon ion beam.  Furthermore, SKION's ion beam technology is applicable over large areas. The behavior of super-high brightness electron emission will be investigated in this SBIR Phase I in collaboration with Dr. J. Cuomo at North Carolina State University. In Phase II, the prototype display will be demonstrated and commercialization strategy will be sought.",

        "abstract": "We propose to develop and commercialize a Laser Molecular Beam Epitaxy (LAMBE) source, which will produce a rapidly variable and precisely controlled flux of any elemental source (and many molecular compound sources) in an ultrapure gas flow, for Gas Source Molecular Beam Epitaxy (GSMBE), Metal Organic Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MOMBE),  or Chemical Beam Epitaxy (CBE) UHV systems.  The LAMBE system uses a variable pulsed laser beam to precisely evaporate a source material into a pulsed gas stream, producing a controlled \"digital\" molecular flux.  The flux train can be varied from discrete pulses to effectively a continuous flux.  The source may be used with easily evaporated elements, such as Zn and As or, more importantly, with those much more difficult to evaporate, such as silicon or carbon.  The source design is based upon adaptation of our existing (and patented) Laser Assisted Molecular Beam Deposition (LAMBD) technology, which has been successfully applied to produce films of Cu, metal oxides (TiO2, CuO, Al2O3) and CuI, to form multi-material systems such as high Tc superconducting films, HAP films, and inorganic host/organic dopant films.  The source is designed to be retrofittable to commercial systems and compatible with flux (feedback) controlling instrumentation.  The development of the proposed source is a natural outgrowth of this existing LAMBD technology.  The proposed source benefits from the safety associated with elemental sources combined with the flexibility associated with GSMBE, MOMBE, or CBE systems but with none of the associated hazards of reactant gases such as arsine or silane.  Further, it allows the flux regulated use of high temperature elements such as C, Ge and Si among others, which is not possible with any other \"valved\" source technology.",

Systems rarely exhibit the performance necessary for successful operation in the field without significant rework to reduce time requirements after the initial software development.  SPS proposes Project Tempus to develop a software measure that predicts the performance of a real-time system early in its development via direct and indirect means.  Tempus will examine the source code itself (and the software design or architecture, given an appropriate model) and make scientifically-based measurements that will correlate with the software's real-time performance.  Key innovations of our approach include: (1) uniquely defined prime flowgraph and decomposition trees which represent real-time software unit or system structure; (2) a hierarchical software measure that captures the essence of real-time software performance; (3) extension of the measure using information about the operational profile of the software system; and (4) performing a double blind experiment to validate the measure. Project Tempus has the best prospects for advancing the state-of-the- art in real-time software performance measurement because it is based on fundamental measurement principles and takes a scientific approach to building on existing technology.",

First, a requirements writer would not be bound to only a handful of techniques supported by any single tool. Second, specifications form previous systems could not be reused; the use if a particular modeling language would not be an obstacle for its reuse in a new specification.  the ability to move form one techniques to another would be especially valuable when reengineering an existing system.  Third, a single project could use a variety of techniques and maintain consistency across the different notations.  Fourth, a project that decides to change its modeling language would be able to salvage those specification already completed.  in summary, the USM is a mechanism to acheive internally consistent, multiple viewpoints of requirements.  USM represents a true advance in computer-aided engineering that provides immediate benefits to requirements engineering practitioners and establishes a vehicle for advanced research in requirements engineering methods.",

        "abstract": "Solar Associates proposes to develop a sputtering process for YBCO superconductors.  The energy spectrum of atoms depositing on the substrate will be controlled to an optimum range between 20 and 50 eV.  Such energy control will remove the harmful effects of negative oxygen ion bombardment.  A sputter deposition system using a surrogate rotating cylindrical magnetron (cf. patent 5,405,517) will be used to develop methods to increase and optimize the plasma capture magnetic field.  With high magnetic fields, the critical deposition parameters of plasma voltage and deposition pressure will be substantially lowered.  The range of energy of arriving adatoms at the depositing phosphor film can then be more closely controlled than has been previously possible.  The process also allows precise in-situ control of stoichiometry and dopant levels.  The net result will be the ability to deposit superconductors on-axis.  Additionally, lower deposition and annealing temperatures should be possible.  The method uses no toxic gases.  The goal of the Phase I effort will be to fabricate a test deposition system to demonstrate that low plasma voltages and low sputter pressures are possible and to demonstrate control of the arriving particle energy spectrum.  Chromium film resistivity will be used as a measure of the effect of energy control on thin film quality.",

Snowmobiling has become a major winter pastime and has the potential to bring a considerable influx of money into hotels, restaurants, markets and other establishments.\n\nThis study examines the economic impact and the technical and commercial feasibility of a new concept in snow trail grooming.  Unlike any other groomer on the market today, this concept enhances the physical properties of individual snow crystals resulting in a more durable trail surface.  Using the physical properties of these crystals to advantage also allows the trail to set up quite rapidly, minimizing damage by snowmobiles following closely behind the groomer.  An extended recreation season is anticipated along with a trail system more able to withstand poor conditions during winter, such as marginal snowfall or melting.",

However, combustion exhaust from the auxiliary engine is subject to stringent emission standards that require innovative sensing of the combustion efficiency and pollutant emissions. The desired sensor must be capable of monitoring the desired absolute levels of key pollutants while providing a feedback control signal to optimize engine efficiency. This project will develop a total hydrocarbon emissions sensor based on mid-infrared light emitting diodes (LEDs) that promises real time measurement of 10 - 100 Hz on board a hybrid electric vehicle. Phase I experiments will include a 10 Hz time response measurement of total hydrocarbons emitted from a single cylinder, 4-stroke gasoline engine.  Phase II will be directed toward construction, optimization, and extensive testing of the mid-infrared LED-based hydrocarbon emissions monitor on-board a hybrid electric vehicle.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee: This research should lead to a sensor that can be installed on hybrid electric vehicles for the monitoring and feedback control of pollutant emissions.

The proposed concept is for a direct drive traction motor with a maximum torque capacity of approximately 3840 ft-lbs., which matches the allowed motor volume of 2.4 ft(3) to result in torque density of 1600 ft.-lbs./ft(3). The new concept has features intended to overcome limitations in present inverter-driven PM-DC motor technology.  Thus, optimum utilization of magnetic circuits, reduction of magnetic core losses and elimination of pulsating torques and harmonic problems may be achieved.  This will also permit the motor's power controller to be integral to the machine.  The external portion of the controls will consist of low energy circuitry.  The design development will be carried out tot the extent of supporting development of a prototype motor which will not require reduction gears to deliver the required torque.  The design concept will be thoroughly evaluated by performance analyses and models including structural, mechanical speed-torque, electro-magnetic, heat transfer, control system dynamics and electric drive power flow.",

This type of interference may occur due to noisy background   environments at the transmitter site, or the interference may be   introduced in the communications channel itself, such as when   multiple radio transmitters are transmitting at the same radio   frequency.  Regardless of the cause, the resulting co-channel   signal received at the other end of the communications channel is   often highly unintelligible for human listeners.  Furthermore, such   co-channel interference usually results in drastic degradations in   performance of automatic speech processing systems, such as speech   recognition and speaker identification systems.  It is, therefore,   desirable to separate, or otherwise recover from the co-channel   signal, the speech signals of each of the individual speakers whose   voices are present in the co-channel signal.  This task is often   referred to as co-channel speaker separation.  The goal of the proposed Phase I research is to investigate and   develop the key processing units of a system capable of performing   co-channel speaker separation.

Recent resurgence in the use of complex engagement models to simulate combat situations has exposed a weakness in these codes.  Engagement models are in a hierarchy, from the lowest level, having the greatest detail in the model to the highest level having many of the details reduced to look-up tables or simple values.  These models can be used by the analyst to evaluate the effectiveness of electronic countermeasures (ECM) against a particular radar threat laydown.  Countermeasures effectiveness is reduced to a quatifiable \"measure\" that can be used within the model to determine the outcome of the engagement of an ECM technique against one or more threats. SR proposes to carry out this program by leveraging an extensive technology phase in computational electromagnetics codes available from its partner MDA for Phase I tasks.  S*R and MDA will bring to the problem unique experimental and simulation facilities.

This project will develop a spectrometer based on multispectral measurement of the optical absorption of the natural gas components.  Phase I will demonstrate the potential for accurate low-cost BTU sensors based on this approach and will collect the necessary spectral and technical data required to project system performance. In Phase II, a field deployable prototype will be developed and tested.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: This effort should lead to the commercial production of a low-cost, on-line BTU/ composition sensor to meet the market requirement for cost-effective automated monitoring in the natural gas transmission and distribution industry.",

        "abstract": "Spire and its subcontractor, Westinghouse/Norden Systems, propose development of color, thin film electroluminescent (TFEL) head mounted displays (HMDs) using passive matrix addressing and indium bump-bonded drive electronics.  Passive matrix addressing vastly simplifies fabrication and improves manufacturing yields by decreasing the number of high voltage drive transistors required for display operation.  Ion implantation of multicolor activators through high resolution masks will be used to selectively introduce luminescent centers and form color pixels.  Spire has patented this manufacturing concept and seeks to reduce it to practice.  Phase I will first establish ion-implantation's feasibility as a means of producing multicolor pixels at resolutions of 1000 lines per inch, then demonstrate a 640 x 480 TFEL/miniature display, driven through an indium bump-bond interconnect.  This approach offers the potential for so greatly simplifying HMD manufacture that units costing less than one hundred dollars will ultimately result.  Furthermore, because it brings together proven technologies in an unconventional way, technological risk is low.  Existing ARPA-sponsored programs at Spire complement the proposed effort by making available optimized TFEL phosphors; additional collateral benefit will derive from a parallel, Army Night Vision Electro-optics Laboratory contract with Westinghouse/Norden which explores advanced TFEL HMDs.  Anticipated Military Benefits/Potential Commercial Applications of the Research or Development:  Low cost, miniaturized TFEL displays will be used in applications requiring hands-free transfer of information; equipment maintenance, training simulators, and telepresence surgery are among these applications.  The largest commercial application will be in high performance virtual reality entertainment systems.",

This material will be \"extended\" past the common 0.74 eV lattice-matched In0.53Ga0.47As by use of an InxGa1-xAs grading layer.  One APD type will have both absorption and multiplication/junction regions in the 0.55 eV InGaAs.  The second type is more complex but should have much less noise.  This APD uses a separate 0.55 eV InGaAs absorption, InxGa1-xAs grading, and 1.34 eV InP multiplication/junction region should minimize the tunneling dark current which plagues low-bandgap APDs.  Spire has sold thousands of 2.3 mm InGaAs photovoltaic devices in InxGa1-xAs grading layers on InP wafers for thermophotovoltaic power conversion which had high (>70%) quantum efficiency.  This existing epitaxial growth and processing technology base will enable Spire to make working APD prototypes in Phase I.  Phase II will concentrate on improving performance, creating arrays, and addressing packaging and marketing issues of the more promising of the two phase I APDs.",

        "abstract": "A fire fighter's ability to effectively combat fire is strongly dependant on the degree to which his clothing limits exposure to heat and flame.  Available heat- and flame-retardant garments significantly increase exposure, but use environmentally hazardous additives; additionally, further enhancements in flame-retardation are deisred.  Recent research at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and elsewhere has demonstrated that ion beam treatment ofpolymers produces a heavily-cross-linked surface layer.  Treated surfaces are extremely resistant to chemical attack and form an impermeable barrier to evolution of volatile chemical groups from the material.  Additionally, recent developments in ion-beam-based coating technology now permit adherent metal coatings on fabrics.  The synergistic effects of ion bombardment and a metallic coating, which can be performed simultaneously in the same treatment system, would provide enhanced heat- and flame-retardant garments for fire fighters.  The metallic coating would reflect thermal energy, keeping the fabric cooler, and the ion beam bombardment would prevent evolution of volatile chemical moieties that contribute to the combustion process.  These treatments can be performed at low cost, do not produce environmentally hazardous effluents, and do not add weight or affect garment functionality, flexibility, or durability.  The proposed research would establish effectiveness of the surface treatments in tests of flame retardation.",

        "abstract": "Standard Object Systems, Inc. proposes the adaptation of its Standard Objects for Phonetic Speech Recognition software for the development of a language based speech recognition module that will enable efficient speech communications with a computer.  The module will be a generic phonetic speech recognition system based on the international phonetic alphabet.  It will support both discrete word recognition and continuous speaker independent recognition with automatic training for a multi lingual environment.  SOS has experience in complex speech recognition tasks and the control of equipment using speech commands as shown by our previous projects. The adaptation of the existing phonetic speech recognition objects will be based in part on this prior work and on extensions unique to this application.",

        "abstract": "The demonstration of the capability to shoot projectiles at high speed under water opens a range of possibilities for both military and commercial customers.  This high speed is possible through the formation of a vapor cavity around the projectile, which is called supercavitation.  By reducing the drag on the projectile in this manner, speed in excess of 1000 meters per second are possible.  The military applications of such a projectile range from torpedo defense to ice penetration.  An interesting application for the commercial sector is the penetration of the sea floor for anchoring platforms or sampling the bottom.  Such sea floor penetration has historically been a costly and labor-intensive operation.  By applying system evaluation concepts to generate operational requirements for the military and commercial applications of such a projectile, a useful, low-cost alternative may be developed with industry involvement.  This effort will complement current research efforts and lead to an Operational Requirements Document to develop the Adaptable High Speed Undersea Munition in support of its military and commercial missions.",

This problem exists because the SAF in CATT only encodes Soviet doctrine utilized in Central Europe.  The U.S. Army does not anticipate meeting an army based on Soviet doctrine in Central Europe, therefore the U.S. Army requires a more varied SAF OPFOR.  The unbounded domain of all potential infantry actions precludes an exhaustive state space search for deriving the optimal tactics, so a modern SAF OPFOR should be based on the varied doctrines and terrains that exist in the world.  To do this, requires artificial intelligence techniques for the rapid implementation and merging or tactics from a large pool of possibilities.  The best potential tactics are dependent on weather, equipment, terrain, and may other factors.  The amalgamation and choice of tactics will give an effective an unpredictabe SAF OPFOR based on the conditions and the equipment OPFOR is given.  Friendly SAFs must also behave in a realistic manner in a wide variety of situations for an effective training experience, so for all SAFs, a rapid easy method of producing realistic behavior must be achieved.  In addition to CCTT, other simulations, including DIVE will require automated infantry agents. SHAI and RDC are already will acquainted with these projects and the capabilities necessary in SAF for an effective training environment.  The prototype automated agents proposed could be interfaced to either simulation or any other simulation at the Army's request.  In addition the mechanism for rapid production of agents proposed could be used for future simulations and future modules of existing systems.",

We will develop a prototype example-based ITS,  enhanced with multimedia, within a specific Navy instructional  domain and a generic ITS architecture applicable in many other  domains.  The use of an ITS for individual or team training will  achieve many of the same benefits as one-on-one instruction.  Additionally, an ITS can promote instructor productivity, cope  with the higher skill requirements for trainees, provide tailored  instruction and remediation, while allowing flexibility in  teaching methods.  When ITSs are enhanced with interactive  multimedia, students demonstrate greater motivation during  training and greater retention of course material.  Thus, an ITS  provides instruction that is at once cost-effective and  potentially superior to traditional classroom teaching methods.  An example-based approach offers the further benefits of  automatically or semi-automatically generating the student's  mental model and of largely circumventing the difficult and time-  consuming process of constructing an explicit expert mental  model.  Furthermore, the more examples presented to the student,  the more likely it is that the student will be able to apply  concepts in new situations.  We have used this CBR approach with  much success in other training domains.",

Poor literacy skills put this population at risk for severe employment problems - in finding and retaining appropriate employment; in communicating with supervisors and co-workers; in taking advantage of vocational education and, in turn, job advancement opportunities; and in performing job-related reading and writing tasks.  In every day life, poor literacy skills are also a significant barrier.  Simple tasks such as reading food and medicine labels, filling out medical forms, negotiating leases, buying a car or a house, applying for insurance, etc., become daunting tasks, often necessitating the services of hired interpreter.  Poor literacy also lessens the availability of public health, safety and social services information to this population, since that information is likely to be communicated in a written format.  And finally, inadequate reading skills minimize the effective participation of deaf adults in democratic processes as responsible, educated citizens.\n\nBy using computer-based multimedia that integrate pictures, animation, graphics, American Sign Language, and English text in a storybook format and within a context that is of interest to deaf adults, the teaching and learning of reading skills will be maximized.  Visually-rich computer-based programs will be used to complement existing teacher/facilitator-led literacy training or can provide learning, development, reinforcement, and practice reading activities independent of direct teacher/facilitator instruction.  The computer operating system will allow the programs to respond to each individual's needs and desires and to be tailored and expanded in relation to the individual's reading level and growth.  The programs will also be configured to provide on-going feedback to the user and facilitator.  The use of multimedia storybooks offers exciting prospects for literacy development, overcoming many of the reading obstacles deaf adults face today.",

        "abstract": "A novel technological approach was recently devised by Sumi Tech engineers to fabricate multilayer electronic components, which enables the manufacture of devices with very high volumetric efficiency and reliability. Inexpensive electrode materials such as copper, or aluminum are potential candidates, since the process takes place at relatively low ambient temperature (e.g., less than 400 C), thus avoiding the need of traditional co-firing step at high temperature (e.g., 1200 C or higher).  Minimal electrode and dielectric interaction is also expected, with the subsequent low leakage and high insulation resistance. The use of a high performance substrate material greatly enhances the reliability of these devices.  Use of a wide selection of traditional and newly developed dielectrics ensure higher performance, at high temperatures and frequencies.  These aspects of the process coupled with microfabrication techniques, ensure a high volumetric efficiency for these devices. This technology addresses the entire spectrum of multilayer ceramic capacitors and beyond, since other passive components fall under its manufacturing potential.  The technology is readily incorporated by present solid state device fabrication processes.  It will not require a large capital investment since today s fabs already have most of the required instrumentation on the line.",

The three composites will have tantalum compositions in their layers of 15, 20, and 25 weight percent, respectively. A standard binary composite will also be fabricated as a control. Processing of the composites will involve heat treatment to promote superconducting alloy formation. Comparisons will be made between the composites in the areas of mechanical properties, diffusion characteristics, layer morphology, critical current density, and upper critical field. The knowledge gained in Phase I will lay the groundwork for optimization and scale-up in Phase II.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The effort should result in a viable, economical fabrication of an improved superconductor displaying performance characteristics superior to conventional conductors.

This project will develop a new niobium-titanium alloy-based high-field superconductor with finely dispersed tantalum inclusions.  It is expected to have better high field performance at superfluid helium temperatures in comparison with conventional niobium-titanium alloy superconductors.  Multiple intermediate heat treatments similar to those for Nb47Ti superconducting wires will be employed during wire processing to promote a-Ti precipitates. In addition to these ribbon-shaped a-Ti precipitates, the co-processed Ta inclusions will also act as flux pinning centers to support supercurrents in the superconductor. It is expected that the high-field Jc of this new superconductor will be enhanced when compared to that of a conventional Nb47Ti superconductor because additional flux pinning centers are available, and the overall composition is similar to those of ternary NbTiTa alloy superconductors with high upper critical magnetic fields (BC2).\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee: The new NbTi alloy-based superconductor should have higher Jc in high magnetic fields at both 4.2 K and 2 K when compared to conventional Nb47Ti and NbTiTa alloy superconductors. The target application for this wire is high-field superconducting magnets for use in high energy particle accelerators such as the high gradient quadrupole magnets used in the interaction regions of Fermilab accelerator and LHC at CERN, as well as in fusion and NMR.",

The relative ease with which a NbTi based alloy can be fabricated into a multifilamentary conductor is its most appealing feature. However, because of its critical field of 11-12 T at 4.2 K, its use has been restricted primarily to fields less than 9 T.  Recently, the demand for high field magnets has increased.  This project will optimize both a ternary and quarternary alloy for 10 T operation at 1.8 K.  Phase I will investigate monofilamentary material, thereby eliminating any extrinsic effects, e.g., filament sausaging.  In addition, Phase I will explore the NbTi based ternary (Nb-22Ti-22Zr) and quarternary (Nb39Ti-24Ta-6Zr) alloys that exhibited the highest BC2 reported in the literature, evaluate them for use at high magnetic fields, and optimize the parameters for further development.

This project will develop a rapid consolidation technique to fabricate beryllium tile with bonded copper backing which then can be easily joined to the copper cooling structure.  This powder metallurgy approach allows the incorporation of a three dimensional, built-in dual function graded transition zone. The zone provides both the ability to accommodate interphase mismatch stresses and also prevents formation of brittle beryllium copper inter-metallic phases. The final attachment of the copper surface on the beryllium to the copper cooling structure of the reactor, would then involve less challenging copper to copper joining.  Because of its unique structure, the tile should accommodate the large thermo-mechanical stresses arising out of exposure to a variety of thermal and mechanical stress conditions in the fusion reactor environment.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  The ability to successfully fabricate beryllium with a backing of copper without causing embrittlement should be a significant development for the fusion program.

A key technique involves testing the hardware placed on a test platform isolated from the laboratory environment and associated dynamic disturbances.  In order to accurately assess this performance, it is vital that precise environmental disturbances are emulated during the evaluation testing. Similarly, the hardware must be isolated from unwanted laboratory disturbances.  Precise measurements of the performance parameters and characteristics is also a requirement.  Presently, these tests and measurements are conducted on a test platform that uses electro-mechanical and/or electro-hydraulic actuators which inherently produce severe cross-coupling dynamics between axes. Thesem in turn, cause inaccurate determination of the actual performance.  There is a need to develop and implement new innovative approaches to overcome these present limitations so that accurate performance can be measured and assessed under the influence of disturbances or excitatins that realistically emulate those to be found under actual field conditions.

Under these conditions, detection levels of 1 part-per-trillion can be achieved on a timescale of seconds for typical aromatic molecules. The 10.5 eV ionization energy is sufficiently high to ionized nearly all nitrates, nitrosamines, amines, aromatics, holons, and most CFCs; yet it is of sufficiently low energy to avoid fragmentation of these molecules and to avoid ionization of common atmospheric constituents such as N2, O2, CO2, Co, Ar.

The key components of the detection system are: (1) a high output KR light source operating at 116.5 nm (10.65 eV) and 123.6nm (10.03 eV) for achieving threshold photoionization, (2) a compact quadrupole ion trap (QIT) for accumulating ions, and (3) a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOFMS) for recording complete mass spectra for all ions collected between pulse out periods.  A commercially available radiofrequency Kr discharge lamp will be modified for vacuum use and coupled to the QIT to effect in situ photoionizaton.  The light source delivers about 10(15) VUV photons/s.  The flow of sample gas into the QIT will be adjusted to maintain 10(-3) -10(-2) torr pressure.  These conditions correspond to an ion production rate of 3-30 s (-1) for a ppt concentration (assuming photoionization cross section of 10(-16 cm2).  This level of detectability corresponds to ",

Current HMD declutter mechanisms only offer discrete, predetermined solutions.  This SBIR would address intelligent HMD display tailoring methodologies that would take advantage of the unfolding information flow within a modern MEP.  This intelligent decluttering approach would then continually provide the aircrew with most relevant and important information.  SYMVIONICS terms this approach as Information Leveling.  Information Leveling, as applied to the HMD, will enhance mission effectiveness and crew safety, minimize crew workload, and maximize situational awareness. For Phase I, a variety of mission analyses for a typical Army aviation mission will be performed.  Next, an information/action requirements analysis will be performed.  Next, an information/action requirements analysis will be accomplished, accounting for the type of HMD (and its symbology set) and the MEP for the selected rotocraft.  Several intelligent Informational Leveling prioritization/filtering techniques will be derived, taking advantage of the processing capability of the MEP.  Finally, derived Information Leveling logic will be demonstrated using computer-based modeling and simulation.",

SYNETICS approach identifies currently available System Engineering tools,  assesses their applicability and compatibility for potential integration into a  comprehansive automated System Engineering capability, and provides an  easily accessible database of current COTS products that  facilitates implementation of COTS in an Open System Environment.  The  innovative aspect of this approach is that, while NAVSEA maintains control of  the database, vendors that have a vested interest in promoting their COTS  products update their respective entries via the World Wide Web in  order to keep it up-to-date.  The proposed approach takes advantage of  current Internet, World Wide Web, Lotus Notes and Lotus InterNotes tools and  technologies.  The proposed Phase I work will: (1) identify and assess currently available  System Engineering tools; (2) develop and initially populate the COST  products database; (3) establish a World Wide Web site for the NAVSEA COTS  products database; and (4) demonstrate the feasibility of the overall System  Engineering concept.",

Recent research and development that is integrating multiple input modalities for general business and consumer applications can address the special access needs of persons with disabilities as well.  The proposing firm has recently developed integrated eye-tracking and voice recognition technology for hands-free operation of a graphical user interface, which assembles a single message of user intent by fusing the information in the separate voice and eye gaze data streams.  The innovation in this approach is that by combining the two inherently ambiguous data streams, the intent of the user can more easily be determined.  This core technology can be augmented to create a Multi-Modal Configurable User Interface (MMCUI) for persons with disabilities.  The MMCUI would be an add-on module that would work with the basic eye/voice integration software layer that has been developed.  The proposed Phase I research will produce a prototype MMCUI.  Importantly, requirements and evaluation of the MMCUI will be accomplished with the support of peer counselors from a local Center for Independent Living.  Thus, input from the disabled community will have a direct impact on the MMCUI feature set as the technology is being developed.",

Once sources of potentially useful data have been identified, the cost, availability, collection frequency, format, and any use restrictions will be documented for each source.

This subsystem will use the first prototype versions of a novel single chip MEMS high G accelerometer, the AD181, by Analog Devices (ADI).  The AD181 containing both a high G micromachined sensor and integrated signal processing components on one device has been deigned for fuzing applications.  This device was sponsored under the ARPA TRP primed by ADI.  The main goal of the proposed Phase I effort will be to demonstrate the ability that a small package containing three AD181 devices will sense high G acceleration in an ultra high G environment.  Three of these AD181 devices will replace the first generation ADXL50 MEMS accelerometers currently packaged into a small .5\" cube for this demonstration.  The existing DSP MEMS tester board developed under the TRP contract will be modified to accept all three AD181 analog self test ports simultaneously to test a variety of 3-axis test conditions.  Additionally, the existing ADI Matlab XL181 simulation model will be upgraded to describe the 3-axis accelerometer, internal processor elements of each chip, and the external DSP functions required to process the 3 simultaneous accelerometer devices operating in harsh G environments.  Both simulated deceleration signatures and real data will exercise this model.  During the project, the present device sensor design will be adjusted for a high maximum range of acceleration and the design will be simulated to prepare for refabrication.  Selected deceleration signatures will be analyzed via Wavelet techniques used originally for speech signature characterization to `tune' the MEMS sensor and internal processing functions to respond optimally to critical military target signatures.  An optional set of tasks would allow for the quick `breadboarding' of the triaxail module and the interface processor breadboard that would facilitate Phase II redesign efforts to development devices capable of processing up to 10,000 G's during deceleration scenarios while operating in severe shock environments approaching 100,000 G's.",

LAN and WAN services using IP are an example of RPC   communications, as is used in many DIS (Distributed Interactive   Simulation) networks.  An alternative to RPC communications is   afforded by the Remote Programming (RP) paradigm.  When using the   RP technique for networked communication, bandwidth is   substantially conserved, as the on-going 'handshaking' of the   conventional RPC paradigm is obviated by having an actual program   (this program is called the software agent) transmitted to a   server machine and executed there (and not on the original   client machine as in RPC).  Software agent technology is one of   the most promising technoogies being exploited and applied today   and, we will (in Phase I) formulate and selectively demonstrate   how agents can be used to enhance aircraft simultion.

We are manufacturing (to ISO-9001 quality standards) an array of Fibre Channel based, network interfaces and switches applicable to Ggabit/sec interfacing of heterogeneous computing resources; this is our FibreXpress COTS (Commercial Off The Shelf) product family.  In Phase I, SYSTRAN will investigate fault-tolerant techniques that can be coupled with our standard family of FibreXpress communication products.  We will use the QFD (Quality Function Deployment) method for delineating and ranking functions and features that might be either (1) added to the next version of our traditional non-fault tolerant commercial grade products to improve their individual fault-tolerant behavior or (2) incorporated into new products that, working in conjunction with standard COTS products, can provide a fault-tolerant communications system.  As several of our world-wide customers are defense avionics manufacturers, we will obtain specific criteria and insights from selected customers (at least 8) to use within our analysis and decision process.  Finally, we will specify and approach to demonstrating (in Phase II) how these COTS products, and some new unique functions, features, and topologies, can provide fault-tolerant behavior.",

Carbide based electrodes produced by this new process will significantly enhance the volumetric energy storage density and reduce the cost relative to existing ultracapacitors.  The proposed processes will also afford greater control of the electrode microstructure. Microstructural engineering of the electrodes will be effective for increasing power density and optimizing electrodes for specific electrolytes or applications.  We will develop processes for producing powder samples and map the relationship of pore size distribution and composition to the processing conditions. We will then fabricate thick film electrodes and assemble test cells. Electrode performance evaluation will include specific capacitance, frequency response, and electrochemical stability. In phase II we will scale up the deposition process and produce prototype devices.

        "abstract": "Epitaxial liftoff and grafting technology with photo lithographically-defined interconnects offer new approaches for the development of mult  ichip module fabrication.  Our approach facilitates improved thermalmanagement, testing, and packaging.  As demonstrated already at TACAN Corporation, thin single-crystal semiconductor films can be produced by epitaxial liftoff technology.  After grafting to a different substrate, the films which contain integrated devices can be used to improve several features of MCMs and the manufacturing process.  Significant advantages of our unique approach are improved thermal management, higher density packaging, lower parasitics, in process testing and repair, applications to electronic mixed-signal and optoelectronic devices, lower manufacturin costs, and applications to flexible or nonplanar packages.  Epitaxial liftoff technology can be used to separate the active epitaxial semiconductor layers from their mechanical support substrates.  New methods of automated assembly and epitaxial film placement will be investigated.  Photo lithographically defined patterned interconnects can be used with epitaxial films to provide electrical interconnection and interim testing as the MCM is assembled.  These epitaxial device films can be then used to create polylithically integrated electronic or optoelectronic circuits.  These circuits will merge the best qualities of monolithic and hybrid integration methods.  The development of epitaxial liftoff and frafting technology will allow increased density of electronic integration by improved thermal dissipation and lead to improved in process testing of multichip modules and optoelectronic devices.  It will also facilitate the development of emiconductor electronics and optoelectronics for flexible, nonplanr, or even packages of stacked integrated circuits.",

The work will concentrate on two special architectures: the chirped fiber grating-tunable laser delay line, and the on-wafer all polymer binary delay line.  Depending on the specific system requirements including the number of elements, operation frequency, and angular resolution, each architecture can offer certain advantages to the system performance.  The first architecture uses the recent advances in the linearly chirped fiber Bragg grating fabrication and various tunable laser technologies.  The second approach uses polymeric switches and modulators in a binary configuration with monolithic on-wafer all waveguide delay lines. Both approaches can lead to compact, low insertion loss, microprocessor directly controlled unit with phase and amplitude control.  The nonlinear optical polymers provide devices with large electro-optic coefficients, large modulation bandwidth, fast switching time, and greater fabrication flexibility at lower cost, compared with LiNbO3 or GaAs waveguide technology.  A prototype switch will be constructed and tested for a feasibility demonstration of the use of advanced nonlinear polymer materials for optical switching and signal processing during an option task to Phase 1.",

The traditional   lithium niobate based integrated optic chips fabrication requires   waveguide end-face polish and precision fiber alignment, which are   labor intensive and time consuming.  These processes are inevitably   associated with lithium niobate material selected for integrated   optic chip fabrication.  TACAN Corporation is proposing a   fundamental change to develop a new class of low-cost integrated   optic chip based on the nonlinear optical polymer materials.  In   this new chip, the optical waveguide is defined in a nonlinear   optical polymer thin film integrated with the modulation   electrodes.  The fiber pigtailing os greatly simplified by using   pre-defined V-grooves on the silicon wafer for the lateral   alignment, and the vertical alignment will be provided by the   careful controlling of V-groove width an thin film thickness.  The   elimination of fiber alignment and edge polishing processes result   in a significant cost reduction and greatly simplified production.   In addition, the silicon substrate will facilitate future   integration of the driving electronics and photo detectors to form   a fully integrated fiber-optic gyroscope module.  Preliminary chip   designs and demonstrative devices will be provided during Phase I.",

The proposed technology is based upon the inherent causal inference and knowledge synthesis properties of the fuzzy cognitive maps which provide a nonlinear feedback dynamical system for modeling a fuzzy causal knowledge process. Furthermore, a fuzzy cognitive map allows the synthesis of various different knowledge bases from different domain experts to generate a better and more robust knowledge representation. Based on the knowledge embedded in the predefined fuzzy cognitive maps, appropriate causal inference processes can be performed to enhance the decision making processes on various information fusion systems. Investigations are proposed on the following areas: (1) methods to map the received information data into the node states of a fuzzy cognitive map, (2) algorithms to transfer the knowledge of various domain experts to the node links of a fuzzy cognitive map, and (3) causal inference rules and evolution algorithms for data discrimination and status prediction.  With the results of these investigations, a prototype decision making software module will be created to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept of using fuzzy cognitive maps for reliable and robust decision processes.",

In order to accommodate the large amounts of heat generated by the electronic switches within the modules, they should be soldered or brazed onto a high conductivity substrate with the same coefficient of expansion as the switch.  This research will develop a new composite material consisting of high conductity graphite fiber preforms in a copper matrix. Because the preform is similar to materials  currently being produced, it will be substantially less expensive that current \"tow\" based materials.  The composite will be prepared using a casting process, allowing  the package potentially to be produced in a near-net shape.  The thermal conductivity and CTE of the composite will be measured and adjusted to meet the requirements of the switches.",

The use of aluminum matrix (Al/Gr) composites for packaging material, however, have been severely limited because of the raw material and fabrication costs of the composite.  In order to produce an inexpensive packaging material that exhibits high thermal conductivity and low density, Technical Research Associates, Inc. proposes to economically incorporate natural flake graphite in an aluminum matrix.  Flake graphite is inexpensive and exhibits high thermal conductivity and low density.  A thin molybdenum coating on the surface of the graphite flake will protect the graphite against aluminum reaction and facilitate wetting.  A novel technique will be employed to incorporate the graphite flake in molten aluminum.  The resulting composite will be less dense and exhibit higher thermal conductivity than aluminum.  The coefficient of thermal expansion of the composite may be tailored for specific applications.  The composite may also exhibit exceptionally high corrosion resistance.",

Current powder electrode ultracapacitors, however, have too much internal resistance to be well suited to high power applications.  In this project, ultracapacitor electrodes will be constructed from aligned carbon fibers, bonded to metal end caps.  By using a unique coating on the ends of the fibers, high conductivity joints between the fibers and the end caps will be produced.  The performance of the capacitors will be evaluated using aqueous electrolytes, and will be compared with DOE's design goals for ultracapacitors.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  High conductivity joints between the carbon electrodes and the metal end caps should increase the peak power available from the ultracapacitors, without reducing the capacity.

A simulation would provide a mechanism for trade-offs and performance comparisons under many battlefield scenarios for acoustic sensors being developed.

The optimal sensor configuration could be determined by having the model interactively change sensor position and coverage while keeping track of the detection statistics.

        "abstract": "Today, the majority of sandwich structures on aircraft involve a honeycomb and/or foam core with adhesive bonded face sheets.  But, there are problems associated with conventionally cored composites. Honeycomb cored composites are expensive and vulnerable to a variety of environmental threats and shortcomings.  These include moisture absorption, internal corrosion, shin-to-core disbonds, shin bulging, low ballistic impact tolerance and low thermal insulation properties.  The frequent repair and replacement of honeycomb cored composite offers improved ballistics tolerance and thermal insulation but at the expense of lower shear strength and higher density.  The proposed solution is a combination of corrugated truss core sandwich construction and 3-D tufted preform technology.  The 3-D preform technology will result in fiber dominated properties throughout the structure, thus allowing the high specific strength of the core to be realizes in the overall structure.  To succeed in developing a high performance sandwich structure with acceptable commercialization potential, Techniweave has teamed with LMTAS as a subcontractor to identify fighter aircraft and commercial/military transport applications and to conduct testing and analytical analysis of the proposed composite structures.",

Technology Assessment and Transfer, a firm with expertise in novel tribocoatings, proposes two innovative solutions based on closed field unbalanced magnetron sputtering: 1) dispersed solid lubricant (e.g, diamondlike carbon, boron nitride) \"islands\" within a hard ceramic (e.g., boron carbide, silicon carbide) coating matrix and 2) ceramic coatings that will form lubricious oxide/hydroxide surface layers after reaction with the water working fluid.  These solutions offer solid lubrication and potential for lubricant refurbishment (through water entrapment) to the bushing/gear interface, while still providing a hard, wear-resistant ceramic matrix.  Alternate metallic materials for the bushing/gear tribosystem, that will not gall or seize in the event of coating wear, are also proposed.  Coatings will be evaluated by immersion in static water, scratch adhesion, particle erosion, and rotating-disk wear tests in water.

        "abstract": "Technology Service Corporation (TSC) proposes to demonstrate a signal-to- noise ratio (SNR) motor that can measure and display, in real time, the SNR of pulsed and/or CW microwave signals with very high accuracy.  The design of the unit is based upon the rotating phase reference (RPR) measurement technique developed by TSC, which has been implemented in software at NSWC Crane's Microwave Systems Directorate. This OM motor will implement MM computations in innovative, TSC developed, high-speed digital signal processing (DSP) hardware and software.  The measurement output in delayed only by the time required to process the raw data, which is a small fraction of a second, and is shorter than the data acquisition time.  Thus, the motor operates in real time.  This measurement, an presently implemented in software, taken 2 to 3 minutes per frequency. The tine reduction factor of 1000 to 2000 offers three major benefits to the user: (1) the obvious saving in toot labor. (2) the ability to make a more thorough toot (using more frequencies, a variety of toot parameters, etc.) without a significant effect an test time or cost. (3) the opportunity to improve component, unit or system performance by enabling the user to observe, in real time. the impact of adjusting the operating parameters of a device or assembly. The SNR metor will find many applications in the electronics industry, particularly in radar and communications, whore maintenance of good SNR is vital to system performance.",

        "abstract": "A critical factor in the development of  multi-line, passive, towed   acoustic arrays is measuring the  relative location of each acoustic sensor element in the array.  Require- ments for measurement accuracies are expected to be the  order of 2 to 4 cm to optimize beamforming. TSC proposes the  development and laboratory testing of such a sensor location  system (SLS).  SLS generates a time-varying magnetic field in  each line array and then measures the induced voltage with a set  of small solenoid coils in an adjacent line array.  Radial  distance from the transmitting line array to each coil, and thus  to each acoustic sensor, can then be calculated. Issues critical  to concept feasibility include SLS size and form factor, array  buoyancy, compatibility with existing array telemetry, magnetic  field generator design, developing sensor location algorithms  based on available measurements as well as accuracy of these  measurements  .  , and interception of the SLS signal by hostile  sensors. In Phase I each of these issues will be addressed,  followed-by a laboratory test of the SLS concept to confirm  feasibility.  Phase II will demonstrate SLS performance via  underwater tow tests.",

        "abstract": "The Air Force has a requirement to ground test installed IR/EO sensors by direct signal injection of computer generated imagery (CGI) into their post detector electronics.  Specifically, the Air Force desires to develop a flexible Universal Programmable Interface (UPI) that can properly condition the CGI signal for injection into the IR/EO sensor, independent of sensor configuration.   TSC has formulated two innovative commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS) approaches to the UPI based on our experience in developing software and hardware for design, and testing IR sensors.  The first approach utilizes a video processor to provide the interface between the CG I and the sensor at processing rates up to 40 M pixels/sec.  This is adequate for current sensor technology.  The second approach utilizes programmable Digital Signal Processor (DSP) boards that can be configured in parallel to achieve the processing rate of 150 M pixel/sec.  Both approaches are programmed on standard workstations and can be dynamically reconfigured.  An adiditonal innovation is that our UPI accesses data internal to the CGI unit and operates on the more primitive data to provide the appropriate signal to the IR/EO sensor under test.  The Phase I work plan consists of defining interfaces between the UPI and (a) the sensor processor (post detector electronics) and (b) the CGI unit, and then developing techniques to implement the UPI.  This Phase I proposal demonstrates the work plan \"by example\"; i.e., by providng a preliminary definition of the interface and development of the two innovative UPI designs.",

While accelerator and beam optics codes are available for design and modeling, the existing codes are difficult to use.  This project will build an object oriented accelerator modeling code with a graphical user interface for input and graphics output.  The code will be based on a previously developed accelerator elements class library, but it will be general enough so that it could be adapted to more extensive class libraries when they become available.  With this package, accelerator physicists/modelers/designers will be able to quickly put together models of accelerators and other beam optics devices and study the particle optics.  The user will be able to change parameters on the fly in order to rapidly understand the effects of design changes or errors in the elements.  The code will be easily extensible so that new accelerator elements can be included.  In Phase I, prototypes of interfaces for input and graphical analysis will be developed, accompanied by a set of demonstrations to provide examples for its use and expansion.  Phase II will complete the development of an extensive set of classes capable of handling a large variety of accelerator systems.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee: The result will be an accelerator modeling code with a graphical user interface.  The graphical user interface should ease such modeling significantly.  The code will be commercially marketed and attractive to accelerator designers and modelers in industry, national laboratories, and educational institutions.",

Optical networks utilizing reflective elements (e.g. fiber Bragg gratings) as wavelength selective add/drop multiplexers or sensors will require optical circulators to extract the reflected signal.  In addition to functioning as a circulator, the proposed device also functions as an isolator. Isolators are needed in optical networks to avoid the destabilizing effects of feedback into a laser and to avoid lasing in optical amplifiers.  Tetra Tech's circulator design consists of two major components: the fiber Faraday rotator and the fused fiber polarization splitter.  The Faraday rotator, based on Tb-doped fiber will be developed by Prof. Elias Snitzer at Rutgers University.  Tb doping of silica fibers provides the high Verdet constant needed for an all-fiber Faraday rotator.  The fiber polarization splitter utilizes a special fused taper coupler (similar to a WDM design) to split the two orthogonal linear polarization states into two separate fibers.  The proposed polarization splitter is a modification of the polarization maintaining (PM) coupler currently manufactured by Tetra Tech.  The specific objective of Phase I is to demonstrate an all fiber circulator with isolation of 42 dB, loss of less than 3 dB, and a bandwidth greater than 10nm.",

As part of Phase I, a concept of operations (CONOPS) will be developed to establish the range of applicability in various optical networks under consideration by the Defense and Telco communities; and a vulnerability analysis will be carried out for various types of attack.",

        "abstract": "Data transmission through helicopter rotating interfaces using sliprings is much less reliable than desired.  WHile sliprings offer many advantages, they also have several principal disadvantages.  Dropout and errors are introduced onto signals as the interfaces wear and become contaminated.  In addition, misalignment of the contacting surface due to relative movement between the fixed interface and the moving interface superimposes electrical noise onto data signals.  Tetra proposes a magnetically coupled interface that does not require physical contact eliminating the problems with presently used slip rings.  Small misalignments between two core sections have a minimal affect on coupling.  Electromagnetic interference is much lower than with current methods.  Encoding techniques are used which allow the rapid transmission of numerous electrical signals (such as strain gauge, rotor shaft torque, and radar signals) in both direction across the interface.  Cost of the system is minimized due to the simplicity of the magnetic interface (no mechanically moving parts) and the longevity of operation.",

        "abstract": "An important need for the US Navy and other military services is the effective field repair of  electronic printed circuit boards which have been sealed with conformal coatings.  Repair of the  ekK*Wk circuit boards by replacing components first requires removal of the conformal coating  without damaging the other components on the board.  Tetra Corporation proposes to adapt our proven coatings removal technology to remove the  elecboi 11C circuit bowd conformal coatings.  The system will give Om operator finger tip control of  the removal process so that just the coating can be removed In a controlled process without  damaging nearby components or the PC board itself.  The process is operator safe and  environmentally friendly.  The overall program objective is to develop a simple, compact, reliable system for safety  removing conformal coatings from ekK'Aronic craft boards in Phases I and 11 and provide this  system to the US Navy, other military services, and industry on a commercial basis in Phase III.  Phase I with the Phase I Option is to measure process rates in the labors\", design the  compact coatings removal system, and fabricate and test the system In the laboratory.  Phase  11 is to fabricate and deliver at least 6 units to the US Navy for extensive field evaluation.",

Such gains in performance coupled with compact technology will lead to the introduction of the world s first table-top, commercial x-ray laser.  Tetra proposes to develop an advanced driver for the laboratory laser based upon an advanced pulsed power topology.  This topology offers high energy storage density, short pulse width, high voltage gain, and extremely high pumping power.  The proposed technology is capable of delivering pulsed powers which are nearly an order of magnitude greater than what has been achieved to date in similar systems.

The 5\"/70 caliber barrel must. have a weight, moment and moment of inertia similar to the 5\"/54 Caliber barrel, to eliminate modification costs to the gun train and elevation drives, and must be able to withstand high temperatures due to rapid firing and fatigue due to cyclic pressurization load.

In the FRA method, the cell's responses to a sequence of sinusoidal excitations are used to estimate the parameter values of an electric circuit model, which can then be used  to simulate the behavior of the cell.  In contract, a well definded non-sinusoidal excitation is used for TDS measurement, and the resulting response is evaluated using pattern recognition algorithms to immediately assess the condition and capacity of the cell under test.  The TDS mehtod has been demonstrated to be effective for determining the condition and capacity of cells of several secondary battery chemistries, including lead-acid, nickel-cadmium, and most recently, lithium-ion types.  Preliminary results also indicate that the 'state-of-life' of these cell may be estimated.

        "abstract": "Six degree-of-freedom (DOF) dynamic accelerometer calibration allows for simultaneous, accurate calculation of primary and cross-axis sensitivities of an array of transducers.  This calibration method relies on measured motion of geometrically well-defined structure with known dynamic behavior.  Using an array of reference accelerometers, the global motion of a calibration platform is defined.  Unlike traditonal calibration techniques, where a single DOF is excited while cross-axis DOF are assumed negligible, this method forces and measures all six DOFs.  For low frequency calibration, a platform designed to act as a rigid body over the frequency range greatly simplifies post processing.  Simple geometric transformation matrices allow extrapolation of the motion at any site (corresponding transducer-under-test (TUT) location) on the structure.  However, at high frequencies, rigid body assumptions will not hold. Accordingly, a modal model of the calibration platform defines the structure's deformations over his extended frequency range.  This dynamic model calculates accelerations at any test site.  Using these accelerations and the TUT's output voltage as the system inputs and outputs, respectively, the response curves for each sensor's primary and cross-axis sensitivities result.  By calibrating all six DOFs simultaneously, cross-axis contributes to a sensor's output are accounted for and do not contribute to measurement errors.",

        "abstract": "The proposed research program is an innovative solution to a critical problem: maintaining stable distance between front and back covers in large, evacuated flat electronic visual displays.  Evacuation is necessary because atmospheric pressure distorts the front and back plane surfaces. A solution consists of placing many small columns between the surfaces to hold them apart at a precise distance. Spacers can be etched from a thick layer deposited on the surface, but this process requires high aspect ratio lithography and may leave residue which outgasses. We propose to micromachine columns and actuators in or near the surface plane of a substrate, such that when the actuators operate they rotate the columns perpendicular to the surface.  Phase I is intended as a proof-of-concept: miniature blocks (microns thick, tens of microns wide, and hundreds of microns long) will be micromachined in the surface of a wafer, and released by etching a sacrificial layer. Shape-memory thin-film micro-actuators will rotate the blocks into standing position. In Phase II an array of electron emitters will be combined with this technology to test a complete field-emission flat-panel display.",

        "abstract": "Present battery systems allocate a large fraction of their weight to redundant capacity and protection against open circuit battery failure.  If cells are redundant instead of batteries, this excess weight can be reduced.  Then each cell must have a switch to short it out in case of open-circuit cell failure.  Such a switch must carry significant current, but be lightweight and have low in-circuit impedance so as not to introduce power loss and heating.  It is desirable that the switch be resettable to allow maximum battery management flexibility.    Switches using thin-film shape-memory alloy microactuator can meet these requirements for bypass switching applications.  Actuators weighing a few milligrams can provide adequate force and displacement at low voltage.  Switches are made resettable by incorporating two actuators in a bistable configuration.  In this research program we will design and fabricate prototype switches of two types:  Type 1, weighing less than one gram, capable of conducting 20 amperes with insertion impedance less than one ohm; Type 2, weighing less than 5 grams, capable of handling 200 amperes with impedance less than 0.5 ohms.  Driving circuitry will be developed for multiple-switch operation.  Bistable mechanisms will be demonstrated.  Benefits:  This technology has very large market potential in consumer products and in automobiles.  Remotely resettable circuit breakers could save significant weight in commercial and military aircraft.  Arrays of micromachined switches are needed in multimedia communications networking.",

        "abstract": "As the complexity of semiconductor integrated circuits increases and the power supply is scaled to lower voltages, the problems associated with radiation hardening reliability and testability are exacerbated.  GaAs electronic devices exhibit a superb tolerance to total ionizing dose of radiation; however, they have poor tolerance to single event upsets (SEUs) caused by high energy ion strikes.  SEUs lead to temporary malfunctions which do not destroy the device but lead to error signals because of the possible change of state of a transistor.  Current approaches to mitigate the effects of SEUs involve redundancy at the circuit level and system level.  These hardware approaches result in reduced level of integration, increased design complexity and higher power consumption.  Other approaches use software-level error detection and correction.  These approaches suffer from reduced speed.  In addition to the issues described above, radiation hardness testing approaches currently used to qualify integrated circuits are very expensive, time consuming and have long lead times. TLC plans to develop (a) new materials technologies that improve the hardness of GaAs electronic devices to SEUs and total ionizing radiation and (b) develop new methodologies for screening materials and electronic devices for radiation hardness before expensive radiation hardness characterization.",

Broadband CDMA using direct sequence spread spectrum has significant military advantages of jamming immunity and low probability of intercept.  It is also the most promising of the new concepts for high capacity commercial cellular radio because of its spectral efficiency and its lower mobile phone power needs.  The laboratory demonstration accompanied by theoretical analysis and simulations, will build on previous work that successfully tested non-overlaid Broadband CDMA for non-military applicatons in the 1.9 GHz PCS band.  The technical issues to be addressed are:  CDMA resistance to jamming, CDMA probability of intercept, mutual interference between CDMA and the overlaid FDMA cellular, near/far CDMA signal strength effects , capacity of CDMA cellular telephone methods, and multipath effects.  The quantitative effects of jamming and interference on bit error rate will be measured and simulated.  The prototype CDMA transceivers used for the demonstration will utilize a state-of-the-art ASIC chip, the Unisys PA-100 Spread Spectrum Demodulator, providing DS spreading rates up tp 32 MHz.  This device had been developed for wideband airborne RF data links, and is being evaluated for very promising applications for both battlefield communications as well as a marketable commercial product.  Anticipated Military Benefits/Potential Commercial Applications of the Research or Development:  The demonstration will show the antijam and covertness militry features of CDMA overlaid on existing cellular phone spectrum users, for tactical and special operations uses.  The potential commercial applications are very significant because of the high cellular capacity of Broadband CDMA as well as reduced mobile phone power and longer battery life.",

To make crosswell data acquisition cost effective, surveys must be acquired at greater well spacings than currently and receiver tools must be operated inside of production tubing, in order to avoid the cost and risk of pulling production tubing to run crosswell surveys.  However, the impediment to operation at greater well spacings and inside of production tubing is insufficient signal-to-electronic-noise ratio due to inadequate sensor sensitivity in current-generation receivers. This project will develop a strain gauge based borehole pressure transducer with 20 to 40 dB greater sensitivity than current-generation hydrophones based on mechanical amplification of strain.  Phase I will evaluate several feasibility issues and culminate with design and borehole testing of a prototype strain gauge based sensor. \n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  In many areas such as West Texas, through-tubing crosswell operation could reduce well preparation cost by over 50% and reduce overall project cost to clients by 30 to 40%.  Lower cost crosswell field operations and expanding the application of crosswell into major production fields such as the North Slope of Alaska, should fulfill the promise of crosswell seismic imaging in developing the interwell region.",

Issues of particular interest are the radiation/reception patterns of downhole sources/receivers and their change with frequency, the generation of tube waves in the source well, the ability of tube-wave attenuators to effectively shield the receiver arrays from receiver-well tube waves, the types of wave modes that sources generate, the relative amounts of each mode in the total produced/recorded wavefield, and the ability of the receivers to operate through tubing. This project will develop modeling software that will allow the numerical simulation of downhole sources and receivers and their study for equipment design and data interpretation purposes. Tests will determine the accuracy of the code in describing the behavior of the Resonant Cavity Piezoceramic source both in the air and in the borehole environment.  Phase II will develop a commercial software package with the flexibility to simulate a large number of downhole source/receiver systems currently in use or under development.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee: Improved understanding of downhole sources/receivers should enhance the potential of borehole geophysics for better imaging and production of oil and gas reservoirs. The commercial software package for downhole source/receiver simulation should be useful to oil and service companies in equipment development and data interpretation.",

RAMTAG provides a flexible and efficient means of reporting tag status or external sensor input without the need to wake-up all tags within range of the interrogator. RAMTAG will extend the DoD standard RFID system through an advanced multiple-access protocol balancing the need to retain backward compatibility with the existing RFID equipment against the needs for low power consumption (long battery lifetime), low equipment cost, and interference resistance.  This new protocol will permit real time monitoring of an area for addition or removal of tags, as in a portal monitoring situation.  It will also permit power-efficient monitoring of external sensor inputs. The RAMTAG system also includes an extension from the local coverage of the DoD standard system to global coverage through the integration of a Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite data link with the Interrogators and high level system protocol. The Phase I effort will establish the feasibility of economic tag-initiated communications through a combination of overall system design, protocol design, preliminary design of the RAMTAG and advanced Interrogator, and performance evaluation.",

        "abstract": "It is estimated that 3 billion rainbow trout eggs were required to produce the world farmed harvest in 1994.  The majority of these fish are reared in areas where infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN) virus is endemic.  Unfortunately, mortalities are highest before the fish are fully immunocompetent, making vaccination a less effective tool in disease prevention.  Increasing the natural resistance of trout through genetic selection is the only feasible method for increasing productivity in the commercial sector and increasing survivability for fish destined for the natural resource.  Many animal husbandry industries have been successful in breeding disease resistant strains.  Although only limited selected breeding for disease resistance in salmonids has been performed, evidence exists for the heritability of resistance to several disease agents, including IPN.\n\nThis proposal seeks to use quantitative genetics to select for a domesticated strain of rainbow trout with substantial resistance to IPN.  Phase I is designed to standardize a quantitative IPN challenge system and make a preliminary assessment of the variability of response to virus challenge between selected crosses of rainbow trout.\n\nPhase II will be aimed at conducting family selection for disease resistance.",

A payload which inhibits operation of internal combustion engines while having no destructive impact on human beings would meet a variety of non-lethal weapon requirements. Immobilization of engines by uptake of fuel combustion inhibitor (FCI) compounds, tailored to disrupt engines permanently or for variable lengths of time, represents a promising approach.  TPL will develop a series of proprietary FCI compounds to halt combustion engines.  Friendly vehicles can be equipped with devices which neutralize the FCI compounds, The proposed FCIs are not hazardous to humans. In Phase I, commercially available FCIs will be acquired concurrent with synthesis of novel FCI compounds.  Evaluation will be by three experimental techniques.  Ability to suppress flames will be determined. A 180_CM3 diagnostic combustion bomb will simulate pistons and enable sampling of combustion residues for extensive analysis.  FCIs will be tested for inhibition of real gasoline engines. Parameters for effective operation will be established.

        "abstract": "Events including the Oklahoma CIty bombing and the Sarin attack in the Tokyo subway have emphasized the vulnerability of personnel, both military and civilian, to unexpected attack with conventional explosives and chemical substances.  To combat this threat requires portable, low cost sensor systems capable of detecting a variety of dangerous materials at extremely low concentrations.  Such a technology could be used for detection of explosives, poisonous gases, concealed weapons and illegal drugs.  TPL has developed piezoelectric devices and self-assembled monolayer chemistry techniques that result in sensors able to detect low ppb levels of specific analytes at a cost of approximately $10 per sensor.  Although these characteristics are promising, the range of potential threats and environments requires a sensor system that is extremely selective to ensure detection and avoid false alarms.  TPL proposes an instrument and software system that would permit a single array of approximately five sensors to be able to detect a wide range of materials.  Selectivity would be achieved with an array of sensors, each sensitive to a chemical moiety rather than a specific analyte.  The response of the array would be calibrated using a software approach to the recognition of relevant analytes under actual environmental conditions.  Anticipated Military Benefits/Potential Commercial Applications of the Research and Development:  A simple, accurate, highly automated sensor system for detection of explosives, poison gases and other materials would have widespread application for the U.S. military, local police forces, and industrial concerns,  It could also be used to provide critical information on the level of fugitive emissions at industrial manufacturing facilities, waste storage sites, and hazardous waste cleanup sites.  The proposed device would be simple and inexpensive enough for widespread use.",

The results of Phase I are expected to establish that  dielectric spectroscopy is significantly more sensitive for the  detection of physical characteristics affecting mechanical  properties than other techniques such as ultrasonics.

However, in order to fully realize the potential contribution of simulation in the design process, an integrated Simulation Based Design (SBD) concept is required to efficiently and effectively integrate operational and functional/behavioral design simulations.  This integration will allow the design team to examine the system under design within the context of the operational scenarios.  This Phase I SBIR project will: (1) leverage ongoing research to refine a methodology for representing and analyzing complex real-time system designs at both the operational and system levels (2) leverage existing campaign level and system level simulation technology in developing an advanced integrated simulation capability, and, (3) demonstrate key aspects of an advanced simulation environment integrating operational and functional / behavioral simulations.  The demonstration will test critical items in the integration approach and validate the feasibility of the Phase II project.",

The proposed environment   is multi-tiered and employs multiple point tools that cater to   different abstraction levels.  Based on a VHDL back-plane, this   environment includes a high level synthesis tool, a state machine   complier, a data path compiler, and a logic synthesis tool.  It   also includes a VHDL simulator for design validation.  All the   tools in the environment will be tightly integrated; this will   result in accurate results and less iteration in the design   process.  Constraints will be propagated to downstream tools and   synthesis results will be back-annotated in the upstream tools.   Realistic design constraints such as area, power, delay, etc. will   be handled.",

        "abstract": "Capturing the rationale behind decision making in design plays an important role to explain a design, redesign and/or reuse an existing design.  Existing design rationale models suffer from the lack of integrating rationale with the design process.  The integration is crucial for the domain of software design due to its complexity.  A model for design rationale capture and its related knowledge base is developed in this research.  It provides method to decompose and organize design and reasoning information.  A primary goal of this model is to enable the designer to analyze, capture and reuse different types of design knowledge.  The proposed rationale model converts a design problem into a problem structure and a corresponding product structure.  The problem and product structures are represented by linked aggregate hierarchies of instances of various classes which together encode the expert design knowledge and navigational indices of an arbitrary design problem.  This allows problem space model to provide rationale at any level of the design and relates all these rationale classes to one another.  The proposed rationale model has four contributions. First, it identifies different types of design knowledge that are generated during a design process and describes a framework to represent them.  Second, it describes a mechanism by which the rationale of a decision can be provided at any time and at any level of the design.  This allows the designer the flexibility to enter design rationale at the problem definition level, during problem solving, and/or after problem solution is complete.  Third, it provides an evaluation and explanation facility enables the designer to judge the quality of the final design artifact based on the rationale used in the design.  Fourth, the model incorporates the concept of design patterns into its definition, therefore enabling designers to use past proven experiences and expert knowledge in their design activities.  This not only shortens the development time and eliminates design pitfalls, but it also ensures a high quality product design.",

We have assembled a team with complimentary talents consisting of Triton Systems, Concurrent Technologies Corporation (CTC), Babcock & Wilcox, Textron Specialty Materials, and Caterpillar to meet the Navy's defined needs. Our team offers expertise in integrating the design, modeling, advanced materials technology, and advanced materials manufacturing processes for the proposed gun barrel program. The design of this new system will be carried out by first applying solids modeling and finite element computer techniques to determine the design allowables for the upgrade from 54 caliber barrels to 70 caliber barrels. The solids modeling environment will allow the design team to accurately determine the performance requirements of the new system. Once the design allowables for the new gun barrel are identified then the team will use its materials expertise to select a materials system that will meet the performance requirements. One of the key criteria for a material system's acceptance will be its amenability to scale up into fall production.  In a Phase I Option period, we propose to fabricate a sub-scale prototype gun barrel using the Babcock & Wilcox Spray Forming Process.",

        "abstract": "Fragmenting warheads offer a high kill radius and lethality against lightly armored targets such as aircraft, personnel carriers, entrenched personnel, missiles, and spacecraft.  Increasing the density and controlling the size, shape, and velocity of the fragments can greatly increase warhead lethality and standoff capabilities through an approach called a self-forging fragmenting warhead, which combines explosively formed penetrator and fragmenting munitions technology.  Further extension of this technology requires the development of small EFPs that produce fragments with high ballistic coefficients and stability, meaning high sectional density, fin-stabilized projectile formation.  Tungsten is one of (if not the) most attractive materials for this purpose, being low in cost and having a higher density than depleted uranium or tantalum.  However, while finned EFPS have been demonstrated by wave-shaping in tantalum, copper, and steel, conventional tungsten and tungsten heavy metal alloys possess insufficient ductility below 1000 C to form high L/D finned projectiles.  As a result, current tungsten self-forging fragmenting warhead designs have poor material yield (material actually formed into the penetrator rod or ball), and no high L/D or finned tungsten EFPs have yet been developed.  In this Phase I project, Ultramet proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of producing tungsten heavy metal composites having sufficient ductility for finned EFP formation, and fabricating tungsten EFP designs showing fin formation.  Specifically, micron and submicron grain size tungsten heavy metal composites will be developed having optimal, non-equilibrium microstructures in nickel-iron and iron matrices, and initial EFP lens designs will be developed leading to finned tungsten.",

Two substantial improvements would result:  increased use of recycled glass materials,  and reduced melting and formation of air-polluting emissions.  Increasing the glass-forming temperature, and minimizing the addition of flux materials, would allow for formulating new fiberglass compositions which use large amounts of post-consumer glass cullet (i.e., recycled material).   Phase I will develop and test highly refractory, mechanically stable and inert glass-forming components with coatings capable of operation at temperatures in excess of 3000oF, with increased lifetime over current materials.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  The primary application is in the area of spinner components for fiberglass manufacturing, where mechanical stresses and glass reactivity issues are particularly demanding.  Components used in melting and refining processes may also benefit from the development of cost-effective coating materials that are highly resistant to molten glass.",

Central to the operation of the device is a method for the  purification and sterilization of water which couples filtration, sorption and membrane  based water purification unit processes with thermal sterilization powered by microwave  irradiation.  A shipboard injectable water source must be both reliable and simple to  operate.  Medical equipment is often utilized during emergency situations of unknown  duration and adverse conditions.  An injectable water source is needed to produce  parenteral fluids for shipboard use to ultimately reduce the resupply burden of  transporting large quantities of water.  Recently, an injectable water source was  developed for the Army by Sterimatics, a former subsidiary of Millipore Corporation.  This system, the Resuscitative Fluid Production and Reconstitution System (REFLUPS)  passed testing for both United States Pharmacopea (USP) and military requirements.  The  REFLUPS did however fail to receive Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval.  The  major reason for this failure was the absence of a heat sterilization methodology.  Umpqua Research Company (UMPQUA) proposes to combine the technology resulting from  eight years of work in this field by Sterimatics with our expertise in the thermal  destruction of microorganisms using microwave power.",

The clear military need is to output only essential information off the focal plane, a need which this proposal addresses. Conventionally, analog circuitry used for this purpose imposes additional burdens on available space in the sensor readout unit cell. This proposal addresses the problem by an innovation which implements a basic smart function, i.e. center surround response by lateral inhibition of detection, in ad-layers consisting of a non-delineated polymer grid triode array. This structure enjoys an advantage of simple fabrication at the detector foundry much as anti-reflection coatings are presently deposited. The resulting local contrast enhancement forms the basis for a wide variety of smart processing functions. Furthermore, this \"plastic retina\" technology offers critical advantages in more complete implementations inherent in the nature of continuous voltage-controlled layers -- as opposed to discrete component approaches -- including greater reliability.  Many commercial applications would benefit from the expanded dynamic range, including use in high definition television, medical imaging, and other applications where the computational advantage of analog processing on the focal plane enables low power light weight systems.",

These sensors will be based on capture immunoassay techniques which will show specific binding of the followeing: 1) ricin onto anti-ricin antibody coated biosensors and 2) anti-ricin antibody binding to ricin coated biosensors.  Due to the specificity of the immunoreaction, little or no interaction is expected with non-related antigens or antibodies.  Using a unique biosensor polymer foam coating, polyacrylonitrile (PAN), which increases the immunoreaction surface area, these reactions will be monitored, in real-time, using a piezoelectric quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) detector (PZ 1000) and a liquid flow cell.  QCM detection methods have the advantage over other types of biosensors as they do not require a label for signal generation or lengthy repeated incubations.  The created biosensors will rival surface plasmon resonance (SPR) devices indetection limits, but will be easy to operate, and not require SPR's expensive instrumentation and intesive user training. Anticipated Military Benefits/Potential Commercial Applications of the Research or Development: Rapid detection of ricin or anti-ricin antibody will allow quick determination of recent or past exposure to biological toxins.

These neural structures are used by all five senses and give us the ability to control our bodies, to communicate, to think, and to feel emotions.  At the systems level, these structures have been characterized as recurrent neural networks. Recurrent neural networks share a general mathematical formalism using non-linear differential equations. This formalism is quite specific to biologically plausible recurrent neural networks. It encompasses, for example, neural network models of vision, memory, motor control, behavioral  conditioning, and many others. Though this common mathematical formalism exists, there exists no general description language to  rapidly specify and implement these models on the computer.  Development of sophisticated architectures requires highly trained personnel and is very time consuming. Often, it is not economical to develop a custom architecture specific to a given problem area.  We propose to address this problem with a two-component solution.  The enclosed proposal details the first component of that solution: It proposes a computer interpretable language that can represent a host of neurobiologically plausible neural network models. Note that this is not 'just another neural network simulator': Unlike most artificial neural networks, recurrent neural networks actually model the brain.",

One rapidly growing application requiring such powders is metal injection molding, a powder metallurgy process for forming near-net-shape components with higher dimensional accuracy than earlier processes. A significant need also exists for micrometer size soft magnetic alloy powders for use in low mass radar absorption coatings. In addition, the speed at which compacts are sintered in conventional powder metallurgy is increased as powder dimensions are reduced, and the sintering temperature is reduced, leading to faster, cheaper manufacturing of advanced materials. The finer microstructure which results can also improve the physical properties of parts made from finer powders. An innovative new approach to producing 1-10 um sized metal powders is proposed with the potential to dramatically decrease the cost of production. The process uses a repetitively pulsed high stagnation pressure gas jet to atomize a continuous melt stream. In Phase I, a Proof-of-Principle experiment will be performed making copper powder and an engineering design for a Phase II laboratory pre-production prototype will be made.",

        "abstract": "The objective of the proposed SBIR project is to develop a video coding technique that is robust for wireless video communications in terms of video quality degradation with an increasing channel noise level.  Phase I of the project will be a feasibility study of several innovative error-handling techniques based on the framework of vector transform coding, which has been shown to provide much better compression performance than the standard techniques for still image and video compression.  The conventional approach of applying error-correcting codes is not a very good approach for wireless video communications because the channel capacity is low and varies in a wide range.  Another method commonly used in computer communications for error handling is to ask for re-transmission if an error is detected by the receiver.  However, because the latency for video communications cannot be too long, re-transmission is not a good solution for error handling in wireless video communications either.  The proposed SBIR project is to develop a video coding technique that adapts to the channel condition.  When the channel noise is small, a high quality video signal can be reconstructed from the compressed bit-stream.  When the channel noise increases, degradation of video quality is proportional to the noise level, instead of a sudden quality drop.  Anticipated Military Benefits/Potential Commercial Applications of the Research or Development:  The results from the SBIR project will be incorporated into a prototype wireless video communication system, which can be a part of a defense communcation system and a wireless video conferencing system through a digital cellular network.  The new technology will allow the users to enjoy all the benefits of having digital video communications without the problem of abrupt quality degradation due to channel noise.",

Many of these devices require a \"clean\" source of power, which may theoretically be supplied by a separate ground.  Currently, tractors operate on one of three grounding methods, the frame ground being the most common.  However, the introduction of a separate ground into the trailer could lead to serious ground loop problems with potentially dire consequences:  electrical fires, ruined equipment, property damage, driver and public safety.  The overall effects associated with separate grounds in tractor/trailer(s) vehicles is not completely known at this time. \n\nThe research effort will examine the three existing tractor and proposed trailer methods.  Different electrical/electronic circuits will be tested, analyzed, and evaluated to determine the impact of current load on electronic subsystems.  Several devices which could potentially provide \"clean\" power and ground will be applied to trailers for testing and evaluation purposes.\n\nThe successful completion of Phase I will provide solutions to the ground loop problem, establishing guidelines to be used by the heavy-duty truck industry and the government to set standards.  Expected results also include the development of a device which would manage electrical circuits and provide a \"clean\" environment for electronic subsystems.",

The   intended application is for the transceiver in a wireless LAN.  The   proposed circuit is a 10 mW Colpitts common collector oscillator   followed by a two stage buffer amplifier, which isolates the   resonator from load variations.  The oscillator will use HBTs with   a low 1/f corner frequency, and it can be varactor tuned over a   narrow frequency range.  This design will be completed using   Hewlett Packard Microwave Design System (MDS) and/or Hewlett   Packard Libra at the Santa Clara University Computer Design Center.   The expected phase noise is -100 dBc at 100 KHz from the 2.4 GHz   carrier and the efficiency goal is greater than 50%.  The key to   the success of this design is obtaining an accurate modified   Gummel-Poon nonlinear model with correct 1/f noise parameters.  Dr.   Robert Anholt has provided these parameters for the WPAFB foundry   and the TRW foundry.  Other foundries which will be considered   include the Rockwell Science Center and Texas Instruments.  Phase I   includes the MMIC design of the oscillator, the buffered amplifier,   and the total integrated buffered oscillator.  Phase II will be   directed toward the fabrication and measurement of the MMIC chips,   which can be tested in the Santa Clara University Microwave   Measurement Laboratory.  The other key to this program is to   understand the market requirements, especially the price which the   consumer is willing to pay for this wireless application.  The   performance/price tradeoffs are going to be crucial to the success   of this program.",

Veritay Technology, Inc., has conceived a novel defeat mechanism , which when couple with a variety of proprietary design architectures for both hard and soft body armor, holds the promise of near-term market entry by leveraging existing and \"soon-to-be-available\" materials, textile technologies, and manufacturing processes.  Working in conjunction with experts from the NYS Center for Advance Ceramics at Alfred University and the US Army Natick RDEC during Phase I, Veritay proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of employing a unique defeat mechanism to achieve improved systems performance (e.g., multiple hit, reduced weight, etc.) via relatively minor modifications to current individual protective body armor components.  Phase II will be devoted to demonstrating the potential of this technology to significantly enhance both performance and affordability through the adoption of proprietary system designs and architectures.  Anticipated Military Benefits/Potential Commercial Applications of the Research or Development:  Potential benefits arising from the proposed work include rapid near-term market  entry, caualty reduction, and cost savings through the application of incremental improvements to currently available body armor system components.

        "abstract": "Vexcel Corporation, in cooperation with Lockheed Martin Tactical Defense Systems, proposes to identify and develop next generation algorithms for automatic target recognition (ATR) using polarimetric ultra-wideband (UWB) synthetic aperature radar (SAR) data.  Specifically, we will address the potential of combining the polarimetric aspects of the foliage penetrating (FOPEN) SARs with interferometric technology.  Expected benefits will be improved ATR algorithms and new techniques for mapping terrain under trees, as well as potentially measuring some parameters related to tree height and density.  Sensors capable of producing such data are expected to become operational in the near future for both military and civilian applications.  While there has been a considerable amount of research conducted in the area of ATR using SAR data, most has focused on the application to more traditional military radar systems, specifically higher frequency systems.  Some research into polarimetric aspects of the data have been carried out, as well as investigations into UWB ATR applications.  To exploit the new dimensions of this data, we impose important calibration requirements on the sensor data.  Specifically, we will investigate the use of calibrated phase and amplitude information available in the polarimetric scattering matrix measurements.  This is required to perform accurate polarization synthesis.  Throughout this work, we will focus on the eventual operational implementation of the identified new algorithms.  Specific real-time applications to UWB sensors will serve as examples.",

A general purpose software simulation and specification tool, using a 4GL approach can be a powerful development aid for simulation and specification of software protocols.  The tool can provide a means to develop protocols in terms of message format, content, and sequence.  Message sequence can be defined in terms of events, states, and actions on either side of an interface.  The developer is able to write and simulate protocols by defining the state tables which define the operational sequence, and can assess the impact of modifications to a protocol by adding and simulating new states and events.  C code is generated that represents state tables, these tables are input to an executive for processing control. We propose to 1) develop the definition of the building blocks required to specify a protocol including message format, states, events and actions taken when a message is received at a node, and 2) create a prototype to demonstrate how the building blocks are accessed and used by a user. 3) Define a standard procedure to use for both defining and simulating an interface.",

        "abstract": "This proposal describes a SBIR Phase I program to analyze the feasibility of developing a demand Assignment Multiple Access (DAMA) system that is specifically designed for the unique requirements of telemetry applications.  The proposed feasibility analysis consists of creating a System Specification, developing a top-level system design which meets the specified  requirements, and analyzing the system design with respect to performance, cost, and other criteria to determine the feasibility of further research and development.  The motiviation is the desire for more efficient use of scarce Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum in the frequency bands used for telemetry.  It is expected that the biggest gains in efficiency will come  through the use of DAMA scheduling techniques as compared to be fixed-assignment scheduling techniques used in current systems.  Furthermore, innovative DAMA scheduling algorithms which take advantage of the unique characteristics of telemetry data traffic can be developed to optimize scheduling efficiency.  Other techniques for increase spectrum efficiency, such as advanced modulation and coding, will also be considered in the development of the top level system design.  ViaSat is an experienced leader in DAMA technology and all aspects of communication system design and is exceptionally well qualified to perform the proposed work.",

        "abstract": "The evolution of avionics from autonomous systems to integrated   suites has been underway for more four decades.  The systems   deployed on today's aircraft are second generation avionics   composed of single-function `black boxes' loosely coupled via   database to allow centralized control of inputs and outputs.  In   contrast, integrated avionics focuses upon sharing resources and   modules that are common among various functions.  The F-22   avionics, or third generation, for example, provides integration   primarily in the data processing area.  However, the proprietary   buses, liquid cooling constraints and unique module interconnects   make for a closed solution.  This, in turn, has led to the need for   truly modular avionics employing open architecture concepts to   permit extensive use of commercial components and elements which   can be integrated into various aircraft and leveraged off rapidly   evolving commercial developments.  We propose to: 1) develop top level operational requirements and   avionics performance drivers, 2) define an open architecture and   module partitioning which will lead to standard module interfaces,   3) analyze, simulate, and evaluate key concepts to validate   performance and characterize key concepts, and 4) identify   high-priority areas which will be targeted for proof-of-concept   demonstration in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "In many applications signal acquisition and data decoding must be carried out in the presence of unknown, possibly time-varying channel parameters.  When the Signal-to-Noise Ration (SNR) is medium or rapidly varying, ad hoc, methods for acquisition and data decoding do not perform well and there is a need for more sophisticated solutions.  PSP allows unaided estimation of the channel where the channel is unknown due to geometry, doppler, interference/jamming or noise.  In essence a multitude of estimates are tracked via a Viterbi trellis type algorithm to determine the optimum channel estimate in conjunction with the optimum communications decision.  This, in turn, can provide substantial gains over ad hoc methods in the performance of communication systems.  We propose to:  1) look in greater depth at PSP application to real world blind channel estimation problems, 2) size implementation of PSP and assess it's tractability today, and 3) extend the PSP theory in new areas as required.  Areas to be investigated include co-channel interference mitigation, antijam enhancements, improved acquisition and tracking, and increased data rates in time varying bandlimited channels.  ViaSat will apply its extensive experience in real world communications systems to evaluate the implementations necessary to reduce the PSP theory to practice.",

        "abstract": "A radical new approach to adaptive antenna processing, based on the emerging theory of per Survivor Processing (PSP), is proposed to enhance performance of cellular systems.  This approach offers the opportunity to achieve large performance improvements (e.g. improved acquisition.,  and/or interference rejection) over conventional adaptive antenna array techniques when a large number of users difficult dynamics and/or channel uncertainty are present.  Orders of magnitude in performance are expected.  PSP is now becoming feasible due to the rapidly increasing computational power and decreasing price of modern digital technology.  The PSP adaptive algorithms will be developed and simulated to verify these performance gains in dense urban environments with mobile users, multipath and co-channel interference.  Both the CDMA and TDMA digital cellular standards will be addressed.  Comparisons will be made to conventional adaptive array approaches as well as cellular performance without adaptive antenna processing.  A high level design will then be derived to validate the tractability of the approach as well as provide size, power, and cost estimates.",

By measuring the amplitude and phase of the scattered light as a function of separation distances and frequency, the desired properties of tissue can be inferred.  The laser technologies developed over the years at Phillips Laboratory are expected to be important to the proposed effort.  These technologies combined with Visidyne's expertise in the field of low cost digital high resolution amplitude phase process should lead to improved sensors for clinically important measurements in vivo.|  Benefits:  The proposed technology is expected to have substantial potential whenever optical turbid media are involved.

The overall design closely resembles the immensely successful Global Positioning System, but instead of microwave beams uses intensity modulated optical beams at high >5 GHz microwave frequencies to provide 3D positional information.  A significant factor contributing to the lower cost is the availability of hardware and software technologies already developed for microwave and optical through-the-air and guided communications networks.

        "abstract": "Development of a miniature solid state angular rate sensor is proposed.  The proposed sensor is built on a silicon substrate using a three layered polysilicon  sputtering process.  The fabrication process employs the surface micromachining technology. The sensing element is flutter inertia suspended by a two gimbal flexure built in Poly One layer.  It is sandwiched by two electrode plate layers built in Poly Zero and Poly Two.  The flutter is dithered about the dither axis with a sinusoidal angular momentum.  When an angular rate is applied normal to the plane of the flutter, it generates a modulating rotational output about the output axis.  The devices utilize capacitive pickoff and electrostatic torquing.  The servo circuitry can be built on-chip using the same technology.  Detailed design, analysis of a potential device including some hardware experiments will be performed in PHase I to demonstrate the feasibility of the device.  The device has many defense and commercial applications.  It can be used in the emerging competent munitions to sense the high rates and to improve their guidance and control",

        "abstract": "The military is in the process of developing programmable, multiband, multimode radios that provide multiple, simultaneous transmit and receive channels in the frequency range of 2 MHz to 2 GHz to support the digitization of the battlefield.  New, advanced ultra-wideband antenna concepts, subsystems and components that support multiple, simultaneous transmission and/or reception need to be developed to exploit advanced radio capabilities, such as reprogrammability and frequency agility.  Ultra-widebeam antennas are required to provide communications capabilities using high altitude endurance (HAE) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and mobile ground platforms.  These capabilities include broadband relay services and broadcast services for wideband digital information.  UAV antennas with ultra-wide beamwidths increase the coverage area to enable COTM (Communications-on-the-Move) and simplify payload design.  Ultra-widebeam antennas in ground platforms provide COTM capability.  Multimode operation supports beamwidth expansion and may provide simultaneous and/or switched multifunction operation.  In this SBIR (Small Business Innovative Research) Phase I program, concepts / approaches for ultra-wideband and ultra-widebeam antennas, subsystems, and components will be identified.  Trades for performance capabilities versus beamwidth of ultra-widebeam antennas, including simultaneous and/or switched multimode, multifunction operation will be identified.  A range of baseline designs based on trade studies will be developed.  A Phase II approach will be defined.",

During the fabrication of these ceramic packages various thick-film and thin-film materials are bonded to the substrate and subsequently serve as circuit paths and attachment points for the integrated circuit die.  Rapid, high-resolution bond integrity measurements must be made at the earliest stages of this manufacturing process to reduce srap and rework costs and to ensure that the desired lifetime and performance goals are met.  We propose to develop an in-process sensor that uses optical thermal conductivity measurements to detect bond micro-flaws.  The optical character of the proposed instrument makes it possible to achieve high resolution at the long working distances required to support certain manufacturing processes (e.g., furnaces).  A byproduct of this approach is that detailed thermal conductivity maps are produced for eacg manufactured part, which makes possible closed loop control of thermal conductivity properties in addition to defect detection.",

The  proposed system will require the development of intelligent software, including  finite element analysis and image processing capabilities, a scanning microwave  heating source, and a scanning acoustic excitation system for the shearography NDI  technique.  With this technique, the shearography camera is synchronized with the  excitation unit to be able to detect the resonant frequency of weak bonds.  Real-  time electronic speckle shearing interferometry, or real-time shearography, is a  laser interferometry technique capable of measuring components of out-of-plane  strain in structures under stress.  It is a vision system, so a large area can be  analyzed simultaneously.  The system will be automated and will use state-of-the-art  image processing combined with Sandia's COBRA software (Coherent Optics Based  inspection Requirements Analysis code) to provide quantitative strain measurements.

        "abstract": "A one degree of freedom high-frequency aerodynamic bearing-balance will be developed for force, moment, and orientation measurements under non-steady-state flight conditions.  A cylindrical bearing-balance three inches in diameter using displacement sensing will be considered as the best candidate for the design.  To satisfy the requirement for achieving a natural frequency of 800Hz, the balance must be designed with very stiff gas bearings.  The displacement of the sensing elements due to the loads imposed on them will be sensed with a fiber-optic sensing technique.  Because the bearings are stiff, the displacements are small and require amplification. The small displacements of the fiber-optic bearing-balance will be sensed and amplified with a modified and upgraded commercial fiber-optic sensor, which is currently being used in a fiber-optic pressure transducer developed at QUEST.  Orientation sensing will also use the fiber-optic displacement measuring technique. This will be accomplished by sensing a reflector ring located off center to the bearing axis. During Phase I, we will develop and test a one degree of freedom laboratory bearing-balance.  A three degree of freedom prototype bearing-balance will then be designed and tested in Phase II.",

This project will investigate methods of fatigue weakening the rock to increase the penetration rate and reduce the wear of conventional drill bits.  Hydraulic power, available during drilling, will be used to drive cyclic pressure fluctuations, which are comparable to the tensile strength of hard rock.  In Phase I, an experimental study will explore the relationship between drilling strength and the amplitude and frequency of the pressure fluctuations to fatigue rock.  The feasibility of a drilling subassembly, capable of inducing high-amplitude cyclic pressure variations at the bit face, will be evaluated.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The techniques should result in improved penetration rates in hard rock with indentation or drag bit cutters. Increased drilling rate in hard formations.  This will allow for better utilization of geothermal resources by reducing the cost of exploration and production. The approach should also be effective for increasing drilling rates for oil and gas exploration.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this proposal is to study and develop an object oriented message passing software methodology that helps facilitate the description and storage of the knowledge describing software components.  The componenet knowledge will come from the component itself.  The interfaces between components are characterized by the messages/data they exchange and the responsibilities that each component is assigned.  Because the kowledge base can represent the relationships and associations between component responsibilities, it can be used to compose partial or complete software solutions. A front-end tool would be developed that could take the OBJ3 specification and query the component models stored in LOOM. Software components could then be retrieved based on the selections recommended.  Wizdom uses this type of approach for the composition of CNC machine controllers, a type of real-time system.  Systems are composed of 100's components from many vendors.  The application model and component models are matched giving best possible fit and alternatives.  This approach has proven itself as an effective way to compose systems from retrievable reusable component libraries. THis proposal would allow us to extend the capabilities into other domains and would be of great value to developers building large scale systems one of it's strong points.",

Examples of biosensing includes sensors measuring voltage signals such as EEG, EKG, EMG, pulse oximetry, blood pressure, and capnography.  The proposed WISP system will provide use in battlefield management, in home health care, and in physiological research laboratories with a low cost biosensing capability.  When completed, the WISP technology will help fill the gaps between remote biosensing and interoperability with existing communication standards, and between remote biosensing and mobile diagnostic monitoring.  The technology will also be applicable to remote sensing in environmental monitoring, distributed process control systems for manufacturing, law enforcement, and in home or office automation.  The results will also be applicable to multi-functions wireless nodes interacting with multiple data types of different bandwidth requirements.  The system will provide ability to store and process digital data in real-time and will consist of portable low-cost software and hardware modules that can also be easily used in environments of laboratory and clinical research.  As a state-of-the-art non-invasive wireless medical instrument, WISP can be used for the biosensing of human physiologic parameters in the presence of noise and is expected to upen huge markets which have heretofore been either only partially penetrated or completely untouched because of the limitaions of the mobility of patients wearing sensors.  The design of the WISP system will focus on the following problems: (i) Developing an efficient adaptive micro-controller based conpression of multichannel sensor data. (ii) Developing a real-time mobile TCP/IP network interface for compressed sensor data acquisition over mobile wireless links. (iii) Developing a noise reduction/removal filtering and analysis software.  Anticipated Military Benefits/Potential Commercial Applications of the Research or Development:  The WISP system will provide use in battlefield management, in home health care, and in physiological research labs with a low cost biosensing capability.",

We will couple these crystals to photomultiplier tubes and measure the prompt response to inelastic neutron reactions with the scintillator atoms.  To unfold the incident neutron energy distribution from the resulting signal pulse heights, we will employ our differential filter method.  With fast neutrons traversing carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen targets, we will investigate our differential filter's ability to resolve resonant absorption bands in these total neutron cross sections.  Photon energies up to ~9 MeV have been obtained with a resolution of ~100 keV in a sodium iodide detector using our approach.  Thus, encouraged that we will be able to resolve at least one resonant absorption band in each of these elements, we will test our method using explosive simulants.",

Model representation will be accomplished using the OpenRLF toolset produced with DARPA/STARS program support.  From a model, a language generation component within the MBSE will produce a domain specific language suitable for defining systems in the domain.  Another tool in MBSE will produce a world wide web interactive application that can be used to specify systems over the web.  To verify the practicality of the model based synthesis approach, a proof-of-concept MBSE will be produced for the domain of web site generation.  MBSE will attempt to equal the web site production capabilities of a handwritten system called SemWeb that is being constructed by WPL with DISA support.

However, material analysis using neutron beam techniques has a high demand on instrument time which is further exacerbated by the limited number of neutron-guide end positions. This project will demonstrate the technical feasibility of a neutron bender-microfocusing optic that is constructed of a single piece polycapillary bundle. Glass polycapillary technology has demonstrated capabilities of efficiently transporting neutron beams, bending them, and producing high neutron intensity focal spots.   The neutron bender-microfocusing optic will enable the development of state-of-the-art neutron instrumentation along the length of neutron guides in locations previously unusable for end station techniques. The effective strength and availability of every reactor-based neutron source will be multiplied in a cost effective manner.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The neutron bender-microfocusing optic should lead to enhanced analysis capabilities. This will be important for a broad range of industries including; semiconductors (e.g. analysis of boron and lithium distributions); aerospace (e.g. turbine blade failure analysis due to hydrogen embrittlement); catalysts, polymers and other advanced materials.",

However, their use for some energy ranges is limited due to absorption. For all applications, there is some loss of efficiency due to interactions of x rays or neutrons with the inner capillary walls.  Since the optics function as a result of multiple reflections, the ability to optimize reflecting materials would lead to dramatic improvements in capillary optic collection and transmission efficiency.  This project will combine two emerging technologies: multichannel capillary optics and low temperature chemical vapor deposition (CVD ), to coat the inner glass capillary walls with thin films. Initially, nickel will be used for the coating material because it is the preferred material for neutrons and will provide improved x ray transmission efficiency for some commercially important x-ray energies.  A two-fold increase in optic transmission, for both neutron and x-rays, is expected.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Improvements in capillary optic performance due to thin film coatings should increase sales of x-ray and neutron optics.

This powered vehicle would transport liquid fuel from the ground to an aerostat, guided by the non-powered control tether.  The fuel carried to the aerostat will be used to produce electricity by running existing liquid-fueled generators on-board the ship.  By allowing for the delivery of fuel on a daily basis, the aerostat can be kept on station definitely.  This would have significant advantages for medium-altitude (25,000 ft) aerostats that may be used for early warning of incoming airborne threats.  The objectives for this program include the full assessment of the technical and economic feasibility of the proposed FAST system.  This will include a review of the requirements that exist in the civilian sector for aerostat fuel transport systems.  Evaluations will be made of the energy efficiency of the propulsion system, the control requirements and the mechanics of the docking and tether guide connections.

The high radiation fluxes characteristic of these experiments requires both extremely short decay times (to enable high timing resolution) and minimal contribution from long decay components (to prevent count pile-up). Barium fluoride is the most effective inorganic scintillator for such applications, largely because of the unusually rapid decay (0.6 ns) of its fast component.   Unfortunately, it has two major deficiencies: a long-lived slow component, which comprises over 85% of the total emission, and a particular sensitivity to damage by the very radiation it is measuring.  This project explores a new approach to achieving improved ultrafast scintillators for high-energy radiation detection.   A significant quantity (approximately 15 mole percent) of optically inert rare earth trifluorides are substituted into the basic alkaline earth difluoride lattice, and the host is doped with small amounts of other rare earths capable of d-f emission.   Most of the energy that now goes to the undesirable long component should be diverted into a much more rapid emission in the 1-10 ns range, enhancing both timing resolution and radiation hardness without reducing the contribution from the fast component itself.   The validity of the approach will be confirmed through spectroscopic and kinetic measurements on specially grown specimens, and  the expected performance improvement will be assessed.  \n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  The project will develop a scintillator material whose performance exceeds that of BaF2 in all three critical ways: enhanced timing resolution, reduced background, and greater radiation hardness. This will not only provide nuclear physicists with a superior measurement tool, but lead the way to improved materials for medical and industrial uses as well.",

In particular, diesel engines are the focus of much work in the area of improved combustion efficiency.  While diesel engines do not exhibit high hydrocarbon and NOx tailpipe emissions normally associated with gasoline engines, they nonetheless have high exhaust gas opacity due to incomplete combustion of soot. Observance of the smoke signature by the enemy points out the exact location and heading of military vehicles.  Because most of the military vehicles today use diesel fuel due to its lowe volatility and resulting higher degree of safety under fire, virtually an entire military operation can be jeopardized by this seemingly innocuous problem.  This proposed effort is to build upon our existing technology for coating diesel engine components by tuning the optical and thermal properties in science-based experiments to minimize energy transfer to the surrounding combustion chamber.  At present, ACT's technology ahs increased fuel efficiency as much as 23%.  By increasing the emittance of the outer ceramic coating at combustion temperatures, more energy should be imparted into the burning fuel and thereby increase combustion efficiency, which should reduce the associated smoke plume as well.",

It is important to know immediately if any nozzles have become partially clogged or ceased operating to avoid misapplication of chemicals.  Changes in field crop sprayer technology--the use of wider booms, the addition of wind screens, and an increasing trend toward night spraying--have made visual inspection of spray nozzles and their spray patterns obsolete.  It becomes necessary, therefore, to equip agricultural sprayers with an efficient nozzle tip monitor that allows the operator to recognize malfunctioning nozzles and take corrective action immediately.",

Higher melting points, (4900 F) equivalent or better oxidation resistant and reduced starting material costs (Al is 1/10 the cost of Ir) compared to pure Ir make Ir-Al alloys very attractive materials. Ceramic Composites, Inc. is pleased to propose an innovative, low temperature method for chemical vapor codeposition of a series of refractory, oxidation resistant, iridium/aluminum alloys with superior protective capabilities for a wide variety of propulsion system components. The unique ability to codeposit iridium and aluminum as protective coatings for C fiber composites and refractory metals represents a breakthrough technology.

Although the high temperature and toughness properties of ceramic matrix composites (CMC) have made them leading candidates for the THAAD missile thruster and other advanced rocket propulsion systems, their low densities, poor erosion resistance and high fabrication costs have precluded their use in any production missile to date. An innovative rapid densification, chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) method is proposed as a breakthrough technology for fabricating dense, erosion resistant CMC rocket thrusters at costs far below current processes. A systematic plan for demonstrating that a C/SiC CMC can be processed to densities of 90% or greater in 1/10 the time it takes for conventional CVI is outlined. High temperature biflexure and burst strength tests together with room temperature permeability and oxidation rate measurements and compositional-microstructural analyses will provide data for defining the optimum processing property protocols, and projecting performance-cost benefits for rocket thrusters in phase II and a host of other CMC applications in phase II and phase III.",

We propose to overcome this by creating a series of standardized, tested routines based on a knowledge base currently under development by Microcosm for NRL to characterize fundamental attitude algorithms and systems.  We will ten create a framework in which these routines can be rapidly assembled to meet diverse mission needs.  Phase I will result in a definition of the system architecture, definition of appropriate low level routines (including ancillary routines for orbits, environments, and sensors), identification of sources of existing routines or ones that can be modified, and a commercialization plan for a long-term, self-sustaining set of products.

Therefore, alternative semiconductor materials for electronic devices must be developed.  Silicon carbide has many required properties such as wide bandgap, high breakdown field, high electron saturation velocity, and physical strength making it attractive for many applications. Commercial silicon carbide substrates, however, suffer from defects such as micropipes and high etch pit densities.  Homoepitaxial SiC growth on these substrates results in antiphase domain boundary defects which cause mixed phase polytypes to form, limiting the crystal quality. These shortcomings may be eliminated by using supersonic beam deposition in the homoepitaxial growth process. Systems & Processes Engineering Corporation proposes to develop a silicon carbide growth process based on pulsed seeded supersonic beam deposition. The seeded molecular beam enables variation of the incident energy of the arriving particles to optimize the growth conditions. Pulsing the beam lowers the background gas and enables the surface to relax after each monolayer of deposition ensuring high growth quality.  By varying the deposition temperature, carbon containing source gases and beam energy we will explore growth of high quality silicon carbide of a specified polytype.",

The multi-analyte ECL system will incorporate a high   volume flow cell for environmental samples, magnetic beads as the   substrate for the capture mechanism and a variable potential   electrode which identifies individual analyte components by their   characteristic voltage dependent ECL.",

        "abstract": "The number of mines buried throughout the world and the cost to remove them demonstrate an urgent need for field-deployable detection technologies.  Current technologies being developed are large and not man-portable.  Biosensors and immunoassay techniques are excellent detectors for these low vapor pressure explosive targets due to their inherent sensivity and specificity at the ppb and ppt levels.  Systems & Processes Engineering Corporation (SPEC) proposes to develop a Force Amplified Biosensor (FAB) for Unexploded Ordinances (UXO) detection using novel and highly sensitive atomic microscopy cantilevers and high affinity receptors which will have sub-ppt detection capabilities.  The combination of these technologies will allow development of a highly sensitive, miniaturized biosensor which will require only a small air sampler for detection of the explosive vapors over a buried land mine.  During the Phase I program, SPEC will demonstrate the sensitivity of atomic force microscopy cantilevels with a laboratory breadboard.  Working with Drs. Brent L. Iverson and George Georgio of the University of Texas at Austin, SPEC will also demonstrate the systematic optimization of the TNT antibody using saturation mutagenesis, a patented technique.  In Phase II, SPEC will construct and test a FAB/UXO detection system prototype.",

It has long been recognized that voice input can greatly simplify the operator's task and reduce fatigue. Current real-time ATC training systems rely on expensive, special-purpose hardware.  A portable all-software solution would reduce costs and be more readily modified for future needs. In Phase I, we propose to develop a baseline continuous-speech system using our novel        single- and multi-stream approach. We have previously demonstrated that this approach lowers error rates up to twenty-fold for isolated-word recognition, in particular when noise is intense and differs between training and testing-a traditionally difficult problem.  We will compute the trade-off curves between accuracy, speed of computation, the size of the vocabulary and grammar perplexity.  By trading off the   increased     accuracy     for   speed,    we    predict     real-time performance for an all-software solution.             We will also apply the multi-stream approach to the speaker-independent domain. In Phase I, we will build a continuous-speech system based on the     single/multi-stream approach.

        "abstract": "Recent advances in microfabrication technology enable us to build monolithic multiple axis inertial sensors (MMAxIS) with response from DC to several kilohertz.  Because NMAxIS devices are physically very small (less than 1 cubic centimeter, including readout electronics) and are constructed monolithically, using a single piece of silicon, they are very rugged, capable of withstanding high pressures and continuous accelerations in excess of 40,000g.  Small size also leads to low electrical power consumption. We propose to design and fabricate a batch of NMAxIS devices under   Phase I,    using    low-cost   commercial    silicon     foundry services.  Scientists at Tanner Research, Inc. have designed, fabricated, and tested a variety of micromachined devices, including sensors fabricated using the process we propose to use for NMAxIS.  With our demonstrated expertise in both electronic design and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), we are well- qualified to design, build, and demonstrate a very compact, rugged inertial measurement unit based on MMAxIS. During the option period, we will test the structures that were designed and fabricated under the initial portion of the Phase I effort.  The- test results will provide a springboard into Phase II research, allowing us to proceed to refine the first- pass NMAxIS structures into second-generation designs ready for fabrication at the start of Phase II. During Phase II we will demonstrate a small structure-sensing network incorporating MMAxIS inertial sensing.

The short trace lengths afforded by an MCM  implementation markedly improve both analog signal and digital  signal integrity in high bandwidth/clock-rate designs.   Reductions in trace, lead, and package capacitances can  noticeably decrease overall system power requirements.  Finally,  with MCM components, the size of the overall system falls  drastically. The need for low-power, high computational bandwidth,  compact date processing and control modules for autonomous naval  weapons systems is high.  The marriage of state-of-the- art  digital signal processing (DSP) technology with MCM design  provides an opportunity to meet these goals. In this Phase I  effort, we propose to design and develop a signal processing  module based on a premier 2 billion- operations-per-second  (BOPS) DSP and using a multi-chip module substrate.  We will  investigate various MCM vendors and evaluate different  technologies for optimal use in the DSP module.  The proposed  module will include program and data memory and multiple        high-speed ADC    and analog multiplexes, providing up to 256  channels of ultrasonic bandwidth signal acquisition.

        "abstract": "This phase I project aims to develop a continuous-speech recognition system that works robustly in noisy environments.  This goal will be achieved by fusing multiple processing streams.  The high parallelism of this approach lends itself well to implementation in very large scale integration (VLSI) or in special-purpose speech boards.  We will also evaluate and train a commecially available recognition system and compare the recognition results.  Traditional speech-recognition front ends produce speech vectors using spectral, cepstral, or LPC coefficients.  Biologically inspired models use filter banks and lateral inhibition for adaptive thresholding.  Back ends use engineering appraoches (hidden Markov models, HMM), as well as neural approaches (time-delay neural networks and learning vector quantization). Combining five front ends and three back ends, a total of 15 processing streams are obtained.  All 15 streams perform phoneme recognition in parallel.  These 15 phonemic estimates are fed to word-based HMMs and then to a neural network that arbitrates among the workd estimates.  In the end, the streams will be evaluated and the system will be pruned, retaining only the four or five most robust processing streams.  Tanner Research has considerable experience with these front and back ends and have found that they all have their strengths and weaknesses.  Combining them is expected to lead to overall improved accuracy.",
