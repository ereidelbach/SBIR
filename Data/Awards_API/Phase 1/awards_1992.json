        "abstract": "The use of optoelectronic materials, such as gallium arsenide, in applications ranging from fiber optics to solid-state lasers has been growing rapidly. The fabrication of these materials requires exacting control over material composition, purity, uniformity and production rate. Typically these materials contain small amounts of rare earth dopants or impurities which are designated to enhance the optoelectronic effect. Advanced Technology Materials, Inc. has designed novel precursors for these rare earth dopants. These new \"source reagents\" should facilitate the manufacturing process by increasing the efficiency of incorporation of dopants into optoelectronic materials effectively reducing cost and increasing quality at the same time.",

Our converter is inherently survivable against laser and nuclear threats - in fact, it can continue to operate and produce power at elevated heat sink temperatures.

HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THEIR SMALL AROMATIC RING CLUSTER SIZE, LOW RANK COALS ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO LIQUEFY IN THE FIRST (SOLUBILIZATION) STAGE UNDER CONDITIONS OPTIMIZED FOR BITUMINOUS COALS. IT IS LIKELY THAT CROSSLINKING REACTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH OXYGEN FUNCTIONAL GROUPS OCCUR BEFORE THE HOMOLYTIC CLEAVAGE REACTIONS.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PRACTICAL CATALYTIC PRELIQUEFACTION STEP TO CONTROL LOW TEMPERATURE CROSSLINKING EVENTS FOR LOW RANK COALS. THE PROJECT PLAN IS BASED ON THE CONCLUSION THAT THE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IMPROVED LIQUEFACTION RESULTS WERE DUE TO THE CATALYTIC REDUCTION OF THIS CROSSLINKING EVENT.

Budnick's group at University of Connecticut (Storrs, CT) will seek to demonstrate this improtant application for the motion of magnetic-flux vortices in type-II superconductors. The novel pile up and avalanche of the vortices has enormous potential for Phase 2 exploitation as a new basis for HTSC device physics.

        "abstract": "Liquid oxygen systems are currently used in all high specific impulse, high thrust space propulsion systems. Although more energetic oxidizers have been demonstrated to exhibit superior performance, they have not been used because of their reactivity with materials and/or their hazards. Mixtures of powerful solid oxidizers with solid oxygen have been found to have greatly reduced reactivity and greatly increased stability. Solid cryogenic oxidizers are one part of what the American Space Exploration Initiative has recently recognized as the nationally critical technology of cryogenics. This proposal describes a solid oxidizer condensed directly into a solid, extruded, formed into pellets, and injected at high pressures. A constant injection rate that minimizes the possibility of combustion instabilities is achieved through mass-dependent pellet spacing. The work described in this proposal provides an example of technology transfer from a well developed specialized field (pellet fueling of fusion plasmas) to a promising new technology. The proposed storage, feed, and digital injection system is expected to be able to satisfy the rigorous requirements for the use of a solid oxidizer propellant.",

To incure computational efficiency, spatial power spectra will be evaluated employing standard fast fourier transform (FFT) techniques. The technical feasibility of the algorithm will be tested and evaluated using DMSP OLS LF data improved to the Air Force Geophysics Laboratory (AFGL) Interactive Meteorology System (AIMS) which is an effective test bed for tactical terminal imagery manipulation. Validation will be ovtained by selecting data sets for which concurretn satellite imagery and convertional surface observations are available.

THIS WILL PERMIT THE FABRICATION OF THE MAJOR AIRFRAME COMPONENTS IN 2 HALVES, A TOP AND A BOTTOM. AFTER ASSEMBLY OF THE 2 HALVES, THE AIRFRAME CAN THEN BE SEGMENTED AS DESIRED. BECAUSE THE PROCESS USES RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE EPOXY TOOLING, THE AIRFRAME CAN BE REPRODUCED QUICKLY AND ACCURATELY. THIS PROVIDES INTERCHANGEABILITY OF COMPONENTS AND CONSISTENCY IN \"RIGGING\" OF THE AIRFRAMES. THIS ALLOWS THE PAYLOAD SECTION OF THE FUSELAGE TO BE INTERCHANGEABLE WITH MULTIPLE AIRFRAMES. ALSO THE USER MAY CUSTOMIZE A PAYLOAD SECTION FOR AN UNUSUAL TEST CONFIGURATION. PRELIMINARY CANDIDATES FOR PROPULSION OF THE AIRFRAME ARE THE SUNDSTRAND AEROSPACE TJ-20/70/90 ENGINES. ADDITIONAL ENGINES WILL BE EVALUATED DURING THE INITIAL PHASES OF THE DESIGN ITERATION. THE ITAP FLIGHT CONTROL AVIONICS WILL INCLUDE AN ITAP POINT-OF-VIEW VISUAL DISPLAY WITH SUPERIMPOSED FLIGHT PERFORMANCE AND HEADING DATA.

THE TEST AVIONICS LADEN PAYLOAD SECTION CAN BE QUICKLY AND EASILY SHIPPED TO MULTIPLE SITES WHERE AIRFRAMES ARE ALREADY PREPOSITIONED AND QUICKLY MATED FOR TESTING.

        "abstract": "1A multi-segmented dynamic leading-edge flap system is proposed as a candidate for lift enhancement through dynamic flow manipulation. Delta wings with sweep angles of 60 degrees or more will be fitted with the proposed leading-edge device of 3 or more flaps. Each flap is controlled with a high-speed digital linear stepper motor and is capable of executing autonomous oscillations. It is intended to capitalize on excitation of helical instability waves of clockwise and counterclockwise spin on the separated leading-edge vortex to manipulate the pressure distribution along the vortex core. This in turn affects the location of vortex breakdown which could lead to enhanced lift and super-maneuverability of a delta or cropped delta wing aircraft. A parallel effort will be spent on incorporating piezo-electric oscillator/exciters on swept wing leading edges, which will dynamically manipulate camber distribution along the wing span in a 3-D fashion. With the proper choice of the driving frequency (i.e., nondimensional Strouhal number), a resonant flow behavior can be excited, which in turn eliminates the need for large-amplitude leading-edge oscillations. We currently estimate a maximum angular oscillation amplitude of +/- 5 degrees.",

TO PREVENT THIS NUMBER FROM GROWING, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS MANDATED THAT ALL PROPERTIES SUBSIDIZED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT (HUD) MUST BE INSPECTED BY THE YEAR 1995. THIS MEANS THAT APPROXIMATELY 2,000,000 PROPERTIES MUST BE INSPECTED OVER THE NEXT 5 YEARS. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS TASK, A MEASUREMENT PROTOCOL MUST BE ESTABLISHED WHICH IS NOT ONLY ACCURATE AND RELIABLE, BUT ALSO VERY FAST. THE MOST MODERN AND PRACTICAL APPROACH TO THIS PROBLEM IS TO USE ON-SITE QUANTITATIVE SCREENING BY X-RAY FLUORESCENCE (XRF) ANALYSIS. SEVERAL SUCH SYSTEMS ARE CURRENTLY ON THE MARKET FFR THIS PURPOSE, BUT IN A RECENT HUD SP0NSORED STUDY, NONE OF THESE SYSTEMS PERFORMED WELL IN MAKING FIELD-BASED MEASUREMENTS. WE WILL DEVELOP A NEW, PORTABLE XRF SYSTEM WHICH CAN ACCURATELY AND RELIABLY MEASURE LOW LEVELS OF LEAD IN PAINTED STRUCTURES. USING OUR NEW SYSTEM, HOME INSPECTORS WILL BE ABLE TO MEASURE LEAD LEVELS AS LOW AS 0.5MG/CM2 WITH A STATISTICAL ACCURANCE OF 0.05MG/CM2. FURTHERMORE, OUR SYSTEM WILL BE ABLE TO PERFORM SUCH A MEASUREMENT IN ABOUT 10 SECONDS.

        "abstract": "This exploratory development proposal addresses a class of novel algorithms specifically designed for tracking and engaging maneuvering air, naval or ground targets. The key technical innovation is the development of linear and nonlinear target tracking algorithms using the recent results in H(Infinity) estimation methodology to modify the classical Kalman filter and extended Kalman filter algorithms; these H(Infinity) based tracking algorithms actively hedge against \"worst-case\" target maneuvers and therefore ensure more robust tracking accuracy performance than do classical algorithms. Of particular interest is the version of these H(Infinity) tracking algorithms in which frequent (low data rate) radar measurements of the target(s) are being made, and the constrained target kinematic differential equations (linear or nonlinear) are used for target state prediction between successive measurements Robust prediction of the maneuvering target motion can also be incorporated into the algorithm, because H(Infinity) algorithms take advantage of \"directional\" information which is influenced by the desired prediction time. Phase I will demonstrate the performance improvement of these new tracking algorithms and the performance tradeoffs associated with reducing the data rate and the degree of maneuver acceleration. Phase II will integrate the phase I algorithms with other adaptive features, and demonstrate their performance tradeoffs using both simulated and, perhaps, actual data.",

Industry is eliminating this metal from usage where ever possible. A family of zinc based alloys has shown favor for replacement. Binary systems with several other elemental additions have been investigated by workers in the plating field and found to be credible alternatives to cadmium. However, opportunities exist for building on this work and providing even better coatings for cadmium replacement with longer life and improved mechanical properties. Corrosion resistance and mechanical properties of modified alloys will be examined and compared for a dtermination of the best coating. Three different processes are proposed for experimental work using zinc base complex coatings. Materials selected for this study are zinc nickel cobalt manganese, and zinc nickel cobalt with chromate film and with manganese phosphate film. These materials will be subjected to a series of corrosion and durability tests. Results are expected to be positive and lead to new coatings for industrial and defense applications.",

ONE OF THE MAJOR CURRENT SEQUENCING TECHNOLOGIES IS THE DIDEOXYNUCLEOTIDE CHAIN-TERMINATING APPROACH ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED BY SANGER. WE WILL USE A VARIANT OF THIS APPROACH IN WHICH THE DIDEOXYNUCLEOTIDES WILL BE MODIFIED WITH AN IMINOBIOTIN GROUP. IMINOBIOTIN BINDS STREPTAVIDIN ABOVE PH5.0, BUT LOSES ITS AFFINITY BELOW PH5.0. AFTER THE SEQUENCING REACTION, THE LABELED DNA LADDER CAN BE SEPARATED, USING STREPTAVIDIN, FROM THE TEMPLATE DNA AND OTHER RACTION COMPONENTS COMPONENTS PRIOR TO GEL ELECTROPHORESIS. THIS WILL RESULT IN VERY CLEAN SAMPLES WITH SMALL VOLUMES WHICH WILL YIELD SHARPER BANDS, IMPROVED SIGNAL TO NOISE RATIOS AND CONSEQUENTLY THE ABILITY TO READ MORE DNA SEQUENCE DATA PER GEL. THIS WILL FACILITATE DIRECT SEQUENCING OF LARGE TEMPLATES SUCH AS COSMIDS OR YACS WHERE A LARGE TEMPLATE MASS IS NEEDED TO HAVE A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF TEMPLATE MOLECULES. THIS WILL ALSO FACILITATE SEQUENCING USING CAPILLARY ELECTROPHORESIS WHERE SMALL SAMPLE VOLUMES ARE CRITICAL. AN ADDITIONAL ADVANTAGE IS THAT ONLY LEGITMATELY TERMINATED LABELED PRODUCTS WILL BE SELECTED. LABELED PRODUCTS WHICH TERMINATE DUE TO REGIONS OF TEMPLATE SECONDARY STRUCTURE OR OTHER ILLGITIMATE EVENTS WILL NOT CONTAIN AN IMINOBIOTIN AND THUS, WILL NOT BE SELECTED.

The proposed target discrimination in the decision hierarchy, i.e., detection, classification, recognition, identification, and characterization, will eventually lead to reliable, timely, and accurate submarine classification. Anticipated innovations include: l) Spectral signature extraction which takes into account the target signature variability, environment, and sonar operation conditions to generate most submarine acoustic signals for early classification in various vibration modes; 2) Optimized recognition approach which results from the integration of different methods based on distinct signature domain and knowledge of the targets of interest; 3) Classification with artificial neural network which take advantages of the learning feature of neural network to both identify submarine signals which were learned before, and to classify suspicious submarine signals which may or may not be known before; 4) Classification with integrated fuzzy decision logic and artificial neural network which blends the approximate reasoning capability of the fuzzy decision logic and learning feature of neural network. The deliverable for Phase I will be the discrimination methodology for tactical applications. Capability extension and performance enhancement of the proposed system will also be made along Phase I period as the research progresses. In Phase II, the validated target recognition system and associated algorithms will be fully developed, tested, and documented.

The voltage or E-field controlled (Q-) switching materials such as Pockels cells and liquid Kerr cells are not reliable for long term operation in tactica applications due to crystal surface (e.g., KDP, ADP) degradation by moisture or due to loss of index-matching fluid. Recently developed magneto-optic crystals such as the doped CdTe crystal exhibit a giant Faraday effect approximately 100 times greater than that of crystal quartz, optical fiber or zero-doped CdTe. Only a small magnetization current is needed for 90-degree rotation of the polarization plane. Because the crystal is water resistant the switch and isolator are reliable for long times; this allows systematic growth of the key crystal, Cadmium Manganese Tellurium (Cd1-xMnxTe), Diluted Magnetic Semiconductor (DMS). The insertion loss will be minimized by band-gap engineering and by carefully controlling the manganese content (x) so that the crystal will be transparent to the laser line of interest.

Synchronization of the down-link data channel is accomplished by radiating a separate orthogonally polarized signal in coincidence with the main bang. It is shown how an existing miniaturized and solid state (proprietary) modulation/baseband transmitter, ideal for low-cost RPV application, can be modified directly to produce data rates as high as a 50K bits/sec; it is also shown how higher data rates can be achieved. The Phase I program is structured as a combined theoretical and experimental effort to determine concept feasibility. Techniques for LPI data transmission and a study of other synchronizing techniques, as well as the decoding of the data downlink by tunnel diode constant false alarm receiver channels are described. A laboratory experiment demonstrating the feasibility of a free space 10K bit/sec link is proposed under Phase I; expanded data rate capability will be examined during a Phase II program.",

HEMTs are excellent for both power and low noise amplification since they posses a high carrier concentration and an enhanced carrier mobility. GaN has a large bandgap of 3.2 a, which gives it a greater breakdown voltage and a higher saturated electron velocity than GaAs. GaN, in addition, is stable in air to ground 800 degrees C which makes it Ideal for high temperature use. High quIaity GaN films can be deposited using LPMOCVD on sapphire. This technique Is commonly used for GaAs epitaxy and has been used on a production level. We have previously demonstrated during a SBIR phase I program enhanced electron mobiIities in AIGaN/GaN hetrojunctions. In addition, we have fabricated point contact diodes using GaN that operated at temperatures as high as 700 degrees C. The proposed Phase I program will evaluate the high temperature chracteristics of AlGaN HEMT layers and demonstrate the necessary fabrication procedures needed for the HEMT device. In Phase II, ALGaN HEMT layers will be grown, fabricated and tested at elevated temperatures greater than 400 degrees C.

GaAs and Si based devices cannot operate at these temperatures and require cooling. Wide bandgap material such as diamond, SiC and GaN have greater breakdown voltages, higher operating temperatures, and higher saturated electron velocities than either GaAs or Si. However, these material systems are still hampered by material quality and low electron mobility. APA Optics, Inc. will solve this problem by combining the high temperature properties of wide bandgap GaN with the superior mobility of GaAs through the use of strained layer superlattices. These GaAs(x-1)N(1-x) superlattices form the basis for a new and high performance transistor capable of operating at high temperature. This approach will substantially reduce the temperature needed for single crystal material. The low temperatures should allow two dissimilar materials to be deposited together without intermixing and thereby making possible GaAs/GaN layers with atomic dimensions. In Phase I, APA Optics, Inc will deposit and characterize the strained layer superlattices for crystalline, electrical and optical quality.",

One candidate system which looks very attractive would use hydroxyl-ammonium-nitrate to react with surplus deisel fuel which is already on board the submarine. Other approaches, such as deisel fuel and solid ammonium-nitrate or sodium-azide pellets as used in automotive crash bags, will also be considered. The steps in the program would cover: (a) selection of the gas generant, (b) computer simulation of the gas generator reaction, (c) design of the system and (d) preparation of a validation test plan for Phase II. The design would cover twin systems, one for the forward and one for the aft ballast areas. We will provide for integration of the piping controls and combustion chambers into a typical submarine.",

Based upon a recently developed plasma source, the \"X-line thruster\" concept operates by inductively driving an electrodeless discharge in a small volume of gas, and then accelerating the resulting plasma with a pulsed magnetic field. A novel continuous flow gas feed and magnetic field configuration makes it possible to build a 1kW class thruster in a volume of about 1 liter. By operating at a 20 kHz repetition rate, only a fraction of a joule is needed per drive pulse, allowing a simple circuit design with small, lightweight, reliable capacitors and solid-state switching to be used. High gas efficiency, electrical efficiency of 30-50% and long component life are projected in steady state operation. The gas feed arrangement permits scaling the X-line thruster to larger area and higher average power without penalty in gas or electrical efficiency, or in repetition rate.",

        "abstract": "Everybody knows that composites have high strength, low density, and great thermal properties. They would be great for a number of applications such as fins for spacecraft radiators. So why aren't they used more on spacecraft thermal systems? One reason is joining technology. Although many methods such as brazing and adhesives have been developed for joining composites to metals, these methods are generally inadequate for high temperature operation, surviving launch vibration and thermal cycling and all the other \"gotta-haves\" required by spacecraft designers. Space Exploration Associates, teamed with BeamAlloy Corp., propose a radical new method for joining dissimilar materials. The idea is to bombard composite surfaces with metal ions, forming a super-adherent metal layer, which is bonded at the atomic level. Then the metals can be joined by application of pressure and temperature to make a nice, neat, nearly indestructible bond. The key is the use of special 500,000 volt accelerates to inject atoms directly into the atomic lattice of the host material. Preliminary experiments have resulted in bonds for nickel to carbon carbon, gold to molybdenum and even a combination of gold to rubber. Try that with a conventional brazing method. Applications range include radiator fins, turbine blades and even golf clubs.",

The ARCTECH proposed approach is to develop an integrated technology combining leaching of the waste reclamation of ammunium perchlorate (and possibly aluminum too), followed by degradative decontamination treatment of the resultant organic residue via biological composting. The general scope of work is to optimize the critical processing steps (crystal lization and drying), which would allow recovery of ammonium perchlorate as a high specification ordnance grade, and to establish whether composting will allow safe land disposal. Laboratory scale experiments are proposed, using pure emmonium perchlorate solutions for investigation of crystallization/drying behavior, and pure organic binder for the composting studies. Evaluation and analysis of the products obtained from each experiment will be performed. Preliminary economics of the integrated scheme will be etablished.",

This new tunable bandgap Al-Ga-In-P material is capable of current matching in a two-junction monolithic tandem solar cell two-terminal design of the Al-Ga-In-P over GaAs yielding a best case predicted efficiency of 27.2%. The direct bandgap of the material system can be tuned to as high as 2.3 eV, where a bandgap of 2.03 eV is necessary for current matching in a two-terminal stack. The tandem solar cell can in turn be applied as a current-matched top solar cell in a triple-junction, two terminal configuration with silicon or other suitable bottom solar cells. The success of this project will lead to deployment of high performance solar cells in the space environment, and will impact the longevity and power generation of space power supplies.",

A digital multiplier technology which can support 8-bit modulation rates of at least 250 MHz with a maximun incurred signal delay of 100 nanoseconds is required. To achieve bandwidths required of the RF modulation, a massive array of state-of-the-art conventional digital multipliers would be required. The Athena solution is based on an alternative numeric representation known as the residue number system or RNS. Arithmetic is partitioned into simple, \"narrow\" channels which operate at a high speed. Our particular implementation of the RNS can perform a multiplication with just one real addition! Our Phase I research will denonstrate that it is possible to build a modulator which supports RF modulation using only a few channels consisting of eight-bit adders! In GaAs, this translates into a multiplication throughput of nearly 1 GHz. We will show that we can perform number system conversions with limited overhead and only a slight penalty in latency (far, far less than the prescribed 100 nanoseconds maximun). Furthermore, the timing requirement of our RNS design is minimal. The designs are highly pipelined, with only local data communication and a single clock. The technology will bedemonstrated using discrete components. A custom VLSI layout of the design will also be completed.",

A method is also proposed for computing the convection of the hull boundary layer due to crossflow, which generates the non-uniform inflow to a ducted propulsor during maneuvers.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A COMPUTER CODE SIMULATING THE EXHAUST SYSTEM, AND PREDICTING ACCURATELY BOTH STRUCTURE - BORNE AND AIRBORNE NOISE. AN ELASTO - ACOUSTIC MODEL WILL BE DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED IN COMPUTER CODE. THE EFFECTS OF MEAN FLOW, TEMPERATURE GRADIENT, AND MULTI-DIMENSIONALITY WILL BE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE MODEL. EXPERIMENTAL MEASUREMENTS FROM AN EXHAUST SYSTEM WILL BE USED TO VALIDATE THE CODE. THE DEVELOPED SOFTWARE WILL BE A VALUABLE TOOL IN DESIGNING EXHAUST SYSTEMS WITH IMPROVED NOISE CHARACTERISTICS. IT WILL ALLOW THE STUDY OF DIFFERENT CONFIGURATIONS WITHOUT ACTUALLY CONSTRUCTING AND TESTING THEM. THIS WILL INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS IN DESIGNING EXHAUST SYSTEMS. IN THE FUTURE, THIS SOFTWARE CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO NOISE CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES FOR DESIGNING IMPROVED EXHAUST SYSTEMS. ACTIVE NOISE CONTROL, ADAPTIVE EXHAUST SYSTEM DESIGN, AND MUFFLER SHAPE OPTIMIZATION, ARE AREAS WHERE THE DEVELOPED SOFTWARE CAN BE APPLIED.",

BY PLACING THE ARRAY IN A FABRY-PEROT RESONATOR, HIGH QUALITY FACTORS CAN BE ACHIEVED. TO FURTHER IMPROVE THE STABILITY OF THE OUTPUT SIGNAL, AN EXTERNAL LOCKING SIGNAL CAN BE USED. THE LOCKING SIGNAL PREVENTS THE ARRAY'S OPERATING FREQUENCY FROM DRIFTING AND JUMPING MODES, AND ALSO REDUCES THE PHASE NOISE. THE INJECTION LOCKED SIGNAL CAN ALSO BE USED TO FM MODULATE THE ARRAY'S OUTPUT. WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE SCHEMES FOR FUNDAMENTAL AND SUB-HARMONIC INJECTION LOCKING OF QUASI-OPTICAL ARRAYS. TWO DISTINCT QUASI-OPTICAL SCHEMES FOR EFFICIENT COUPLING OF THE SIGNAL INTO THE ARRAY WILL BE EXPLORED. AN ALTERNATIVE SCHEME IN WHICH THE LOCKING SIGNAL IS FED DIRECTLY ONTO THE WAFER USING AN INTEGRETED DIODE MULTIPLIER WILL ALSO BE EXAMINED. PRELIMANRY TESTS OF THIS SCHEME WILL BE PERFORMED WITH A 10 GHZ ARRAY THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN BUILT. THE KEY FIGURE OF MERIT IS THE BANDWIDTH OVER WHICH INJECTION LOCKING IS OBTAINED FOR A GIVEN POWER.

Such noise is complex, composed primarily of engine noise, wave induced hull vibrations, and other hydrodynamic pressure-induced noise due to propeller cavitation and flow. The proposed project will developadaptive nonlinear polynomial neural network noise prediction and cancellation algorithms to suppress shipborne noise in hull-mounted sonar sensors electronically via active noise suppression technies. The nonlinear processing will significantly improve prediction of shipborne acoustic sensor noise, and thus provide enhanced performace of the noise suppression, because it will not be limited to narrowband Gaussion interferers as are linear algorithms.",

        "abstract": "1The Navy has been investigating membrane distillation (MD) as a means of desalinating seawater aboard ships since 1983. MD could potentially offer advantages over conventional distillation, the technology in most common use now, and could offer an alternative to other promising membrane technologies such as reverse osmosis. These potential advantages include small size, simplicity, and low energy requirements. MD is also relatively unaffected by salt concentration, not susceptible to fouling, and produces essentially pure water that does not need further treatment. MD has never been commercialized, primarily because no membrane has yet been developed specifically for this application. To render this technology available for full Navy consideration, we propose to develop an MD membrane and the accompanying module. In Phase I we will investigate the technical feasibility of developing a membrane that, when optimized during Phase II, would meet Navy Specifications for MD. During Phase I this membrane will be incorporated into a first-generation module and tested against the Navy specificatons. The results of this test will indicate whether the membranes are technically feasible and will specific targets for Phase II optimization. The ultimate goal of the program is to commercialize the proposed new technology to meet the needs of the Navy. We have established a spin-off company, Bend Membrane Technologies, to manufacture and market membranes based on our technologies. This company could offer an avenue for membrane manufacture in quantities that would meet those needs.",

        "abstract": "Benthos, a leader in the development of Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) systems, has conceptualized a miniature ROV system capable of providing a method of inspecting and maintaining submarine systems and components located in free flood areas while the submarine remains waterborne. Important advantages of the ROV system are that it will allow the Navy to conduct submarine inspection and maintenance operations that previously have either required the ship to be placed in dry dock or the use of divers. The ROV is small and is configured to allow entrance, unencumbered maneuvering, and egress without removal of protective grids and structural elements of the free flood areas. The ROV will be capable of transmitting real time video and other sensor data via an umbilical to a surface or ship-mounted operator control and monitoring station. Simple tools and devices can be fitted to the ROV to allow maintenance activities. The ROV can also be used to position and apply other surface deployed inspection, maintenance and repair tools. The ROV system concept and its operational use meets all Navy safety requirements and is within the capabilities of submarine Intermediate Maintenance Activities (IMAs). The concept incorporates standard Benthos production ROV modules and components minimizing development risk, allowing rapid future finalization and commercialization of the proposed system, and, most importantly, resulting in low cost production systems. The objective of the Phase I effort is to fully define a specification for a Phase II prototype system. During Phase II a prototype will be fabricated, demonstrated in a Navy IMA environment, and refined to a final preproduction configuration. During Phase III the ROV system will be commercialized.",

ESSENTIAL TO THE LOCOMOTIVE CONCEPT ARE CLUSTERS OF THREE WHEELS MOUNTED IN A PLANETARY FASHION ABOUT A COMMON AXIS. FOUR OF THESE THREE WHEEL CLUSTERS ARE IN TURN MOUNTED AT THE CORNERS OF A VEHICLE PLATFORM. EACH OF THE THREE WHEELS IN A CLUSTER IS DRIVEN BY A SIMPLE PLANETARY MECHANISM RESULTING IN ALL 12 WHEELS BEING CONTINUOUSLY DRIVEN. AS EACH THREE WHEEL CLUSTER CAN PIVOT FREELY ON ITS CENTRAL AXIS TO ACCOMMODATE TERRAIN VARIATIONS AND OBSTACLES, NUMEROUS DRIVEN WHEELS ARE IN CONTACT WITH THE SUPPORTING SURFACE AT ANY ONE TIME. WHEN A LARGE OBSTACLE IS ENCOUNTERED, THE WHEEL CLUSTERS ROTATE TO PROVIDE LIFTING AND TRACTIVE FORCES. IN LIKE MANNER, WHEN WATER IS ENCOUNTERED, THE CLUSTER ASSEMBLIES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO \"PADDLE WHEEL\" ROTATE, PROVIDING MOTIVE FORCE UNTIL WHEEL TRACTION IS AGAIN REESTABLISHED.

We propose to use polyaniline film as anode; metallic lithium, zinc, etc. as cathode; and flexible polyvinyl alcohol film as electrolyte. The use of solid electrolyte will eliminate the evolution of hydrogen gas, and the use of film electrode will significantly reduce battery weight because of the use of conducting polymer as anode. These super thin plastic films will render the battery susceptible to being shaped, cut and molded into any conventional and non-conventional shapes. Due to the absence of liquid electrolyte, this battery will be ruggedized to minimize power loss from punctures, such as bullet holes. The plastics, which we use in this battery, whether conducting or non-conducting, will with- stand temperatures ranging from 30 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit. The technologies we have invented-the manufacturing methods of large area polyaniline film and flexible PVA film, and the assembly method of Super Thin Multilayer Rechargeable Plastic Batteries-will make our attempt possible and succesful.",

IN PHASE I, FOCUS WILL BE ON THE USE OF THE SIMPLEST MATRIX AS A BIOCOMPATIBLE ELASTOMERIC BARRIER (TO WHICH CELLS DO NOT ADHERE AND AROUND WHICH FIBROUS ENCAPSULATION DOES NOT OCCUR) TO PREVENT THE FORMATION OF ADHESION OF ARTIFICIAL HEART COMPONENTS TO PERICARDIUM, TO LUNG, ETC. MORE THAN 400,000 OPEN-HEART SURGICAL PROCEDURES ARE PERFORMED ANNUALLY IN THE U.S.; IN SOME CENTERS UP TO ONE IN FIVE HAVE BEEN 'REDO' OPERATIONS, WHERE CONSTRICTIVE PERICARDITIS, SEVERE HEMORRHAGE, LACERATION OF THE HEART OR SEVERING OF PREVIOUSLY IMPLANTED AORTA-CORONARY GRAFTS ARE SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS.",

However, the diagnosis of MIC type corrosion is often difficult to make using the techniques commonly employed requiring large amounts of tiem and money and \"expert opinion\". Ther is a need for a less subjective indicator of MIC. The work of several Naval laboratory scientists has shown that certain minerals can only be produced at normal environmental conditions through the action of microbes, especially the sulfate reducing bateria. These provide metallurgical fingerprints for iron, steels and copper alloys. The goals of the research proposed are 1) to develop test kits for use by field personnel which will allow collection of corrosion products: such a way as to perserve the mineralogical factors diagnostic of MIC and 2) to establish that a service to provide XRD analysis of the samples for the MIC fingerprint materials can be operated to provide sample turn around in more than 48 hours and at a cost of no more than $300 per sample (including sampling kit).",

Conventional spark ignition or glow plug systems do a poor job of igniting the fuel-air mixture. Other disadvantages include weight, cost, electrical interference and low reliability. The unique Catalytic Plasma Torch (CPT) ignition produces a large volume of ignition reactants compared to SI. It eliminates lean misfire and is self timing. Since the CPT operates on low power DC voltage, it is lighter and lower in cost. The proposed project will demonstrate the CPT ignition in a low compression rotary engine using JP-5 fuel and compare CPT performance with the existing glow plug ignition.

The HT is a magnetized neutral plasma electrostatic thruster that has been successfully deployed by the Russians. Efficiencies of 50-70 % at Isp up to 3000 second were achieved, and lifetimes in thousands of hours were demonstrated. The HT performance may be improved by replacing the current propellant of choice (Xe) with C60. With C60, the HT can achieve 90% efficiency without decreasing thrust density which is already ten times larger than in conventional ion thrusters. The effort will start with the design and construction of the C60 feed system and experiments related to C60 vapor generation, flow control, and fragmentation. Later, a prototype HT will be built, and its performance with C60 will be compared with Xe. The final objective is a commercial HT with C60 propellant resulting in a high efficiency, long life, economical electric space propulsion unit.",

CURRENT INDOOR AIR POLLUTION MODELS HAVE LIMITED ABILITY TO DEAL WITH SUCH HETEROGENEOUS CONDITIONS. IN THIS RESEARCH, SYSTEM DYNAMICS SOFTWARE IS BEING APPLIED TO SIMULATE AIR DISPERSION IN OPEN INDOOR SETTINGS. THE MODELING APPROACH CONSISTS OF DIVIDING THE INDOOR SPACE INTO AN INTERCONNECTED NETWORK OF SUBVOLUMES. ADJACENT SUBVOLUMES ARE ASSUMED TO EXCHANGE POLLUTANTS. IN ADDITION, A VARIETY OF PHYSICAL PROCESSES ARE MODELED THAT INFLUENCE THE CONCENTRATIONS OF POLLUTANTS IN EACH SUBVOLUME, INCLUDING EMISSIONS, LOCAL AIR SUPPLY OR VENTILATION, AND CHEMICAL REACTIONS. MODELING IS PERFORMED IN AN INTERACTIVE GRAPHICAL ENVIRONMENT THAT CORRESPONDS TO THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT. MODELING ELEMENTS INCLUDE BOTH SUBVOLUMES AND CONNECTORS THAT REPRESENT THE UNDERLYING MATHEMATICAL EQUATIONS, WHICH ARE AUTOMATICALLY SOLVED AS A LINKED SYSTEM OF TIME-DEPENDENT DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS. THE USEFULNESS OF THE MODELING APPROACH WILL BE DEMONSTRATED BY APPLYING THE ALGORITHMS TO INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE SURVEYS IN WHICH EMPIRICAL DATA HAVE BEEN COLLECTED.",

IN HIGHER VERTEBRATES, GAPS ARE KNOWN TO BE EXPRESSED IN GREATER THAN NORMAL QUANTITIES DURING PERIODS OF AXONAL OUTGROWTH AND IN RESPONSE TO INJURY. THE SEARCH FOR GAPS DERIVED FROM THE CNS OF THE SEA LAMPREY REPRESENTS A POTENTIALLY VALUABLE AVENUE OF RESEARCH AS LAMPREYS ARE THE ONLY VERTEBRATES TO DEMONSTRATE FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY FOLLOWING COMPLETE SPINAL CORD TRANSECTION. THEREFORE, THE GAPS EXPRESSED IN THIS SPECIES COULD PROVIDE UNIQUE TOOLS FOR THE INVESTIGATION OF THE MECHANISMS OF BOTH NORMAL AXONAL OUTGROWTH AND NERVE REGENERATION. DURING PHASE I WE WILL DEVELOP A NOVEL IN VITRO ISOLATED NEURAXIS PREPARATION THAT TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE UNIQUE FEATURES OF LAMPREY CNS PHYSIOLOGY. THIS PREPARATION WILL BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH TWO-DIMENSION (2-D) GEL ELECTROPHORESIS OF RADIOLABELED PROTEINS, AS IT HAS BEEN EMPLOYED SUCCESSFULLY IN THE PAST IN THE IDENTIFICATION AND ISOLATION OF GAPS FOUND IN MANY OTHER VERTEBRATE SPECIES.",

Canditate composite materials and submaring components will be reviewed and items identified that can be made using this technology. A general cost analysis will be performed on the proposed fabrication method and a detailed analysis will be done on a selected component. Due to the low cost associated with the methods proposed, a small component will be selected and made as part of the technology demonstration.

The approach focuses on the design of the voice interface for a single workstation type, at the level of the human/machine dialog. The design process will be driven by two principal concerns: controlling the impact of recognition errors on interface performance and ultirnately on worker productivity; and integrating secondary, voice-related interface activities with worker production tasks. The detailed structure for information exchange across the voice channel specified in the design will define the capabilities and limitations of the fully implemented NISTARS voice data entry system. The completed design will include variants to encompass visual and auditory feedback, design options which drastically alter st mctural choices. A plan will be developed for implementation of the voice data entry system as designed. Based on the performance implications of the design and the projected implementation and maintenance costs, a cost benefit assessment will be performed .",

        "abstract": "Both passive and active tracking optical sensors, such as infrared seekers in hypersonic missiles, or laser pointing systems, require high angular precision. Vibration-induced distortion of optical components creates image distortions, image jitter, and can seriously degrade the performance of the system. The present work investigates the feasibility of employing adaptive optical techniques for the compensation of vibration-induced optical system distortions. Similar vibration-related problems occur in many industrial applications, and it is expected that the methods and hardware compensation system developed in this program would have commercial application beyond the military.",

PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE INDICATED A SUBSTANTIAL PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS IF THE ULTRAHIGH LEVELS OF CENTRIFUGE GRAVITY ARE COMBINED WITH THE CENTRIFUGAL DECANTING/FILTRATION PROCESS DEVELOPED EARLIER. NEW METHODS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR OPERATING CENTRIFUGES, COMBINING DECANTING AND FILTRATION AT HIGH LEVELS OF GRAVITY AND WITHOUT BLINDING THE FILTERS. THE NEW BATCH TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATES COMPOSITES FOR THE BOWL AND AN ULTRAEFFICIENT VARIABLE FREQUENCY AC DRIVE SO THAT THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION IS HELD TO LOW LEVELS. THE PROCESS INVOLVES NO DETRIMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. BOWL STRESS, VIBRATION DYNAMICS, AND FILTER PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AND PATENTED; THE LIMITS OF THEIR CAPABILITIES HAVE NOT YET BEEN EXPLORED. PHASE I COMPRISES AN IN-DEPTH STUDY OF GRAVITY LEVELS REQUIRED FOR DRYING ULTRAFINE DEEP CLEANED COAL TO ABOUT 10 TO 12% SURFACE MOISTURE. BY USING EXISTING HARDWARE, IN-HOUSE DEVELOPED SOFTWARE, AND APPROPRIATE CONSULTATIONS, DETERMINATION OF THE LIMITATIONS WITHIN WHICH THE ADVANCED CENTRIFUGES CAN BE DESIGNED WILL BE MADE.

The adaptive control algorithm is based on a simplified version of a model reference adaptive control concept. It possesses two features: (i) more robust performance for the interceptor guidance and control system under the influence of dynamic variations without the need of a parameter estimate, and (ii) ease of implementation, which is attractive to the enhancement of the interceptor performance. The adaptive control law is then configured together with the traditional fixed-gain controller to yield an optimal, reliable, and more robust performance architecture. This architecture can be applied to not only SDIO applications but also to a wider class of nonlinear and linear systems whose parameters are time-varying such as: robotic control, control of flexible space structure process control, and advanced self-repairing flight control systems.",

        "abstract": "Conventional guidance algorithms for exoatmospheric kinetic energy weapons are based on algorithms developed for endoatmospheric missile systems. With the appropriate assumptions and definitions, the algorithms can be shown to be optimal. Although they perform well under limited circumstances, the algorithms perform poorly in the general case because of inefficient use of imprecise information about the target, inefficient management of fuel resources, and a general lack of robustness. An algorithm which is better matched to the particular requirements of the exoatmospheric KEW guidance problem is needed. Fuzzy logic decision theory is shown to be directly applicable to this problem with the appropriate selection of fuzzy set definitions and membership functions. The objective of this research effort is to develop a guidance algorithm based of fuzzy logic by selecting fuzzy constraint sets, constraint weights, and the fuzzy decision function. This algorithm will then be demonstrated and its performance compared to conventional guidance algorithms through the use of an existing 6DOF simulation. The benefit of the algorithm in terms of reduced fuel utilization, decreased miss distance, increased robustness, and ease with which supplemental constraints can augment performance will be demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "The assignment problem is a linear programming problem in which the goal is to determine the assignment of sources to destinations so as to minimize the cost. This arises in numerous areas, including assigning interceptors to threats in battle. Generally, the solution is very time consuming when the number of sources and destinations is large. Also, the problem is difficult when the cost of assignments is dynamically changing. Real-time solutions are needed, especially in a dynamic battle space like the boost-phase intercept of ICBMs using space-based weapons. Conventional solutions on conventional computer architectures are sequential and therefore not well matched to the problem. A dynamic parallel architecture, such as a neural network, can offer significant performance advantages and provide other benefits including increased solution accuracy in the presence of uncertainty of cost information and solution stability as the problem scope changes in real-time. The objective of this research is to design a neural network prototype for solving the time-dependent assignment problem. The performance of this network will be compared to conventional algorithms in solving a set of realistic space-based interceptor assignment problems.",

An innovative technique for producing very high impulse at excellent thrust-to-weight ratios is known as laser-powered heat-exchanger propulsion. A remotely stationed high power laser is used to heat a propellent gas within a rocket engine, and the heated gas is exhausted to generate thrust at very high specific impulses. Until now, laser propulsion research has focussed on the use of high-temperature plasmas to convert laser energy into propellant heat. CSI's approach will use a direct-absorption \"heat exchanger\" as the conversion mechanism, a technique which is far less complex yet offers specific impulse performance in the range of 500-1000 seconds. Such a propulsion system can increase the payload capacity of on-orbit orbital transfer vehicles, or can enhance the range capability of ground-based interceptors.",

        "abstract": "Improving ship producibility is the key method for reducing U.S. Navy ship construction cost without compromise to mission capability. Producibility in ship design is impeded by differing mind-sets about ship design and construction between the Navy and shipyards. Knowledge of potential producibility problems during early ship design would allow changes to be made early, significantly reducing costs. A ship producibility lessons learned intelligent database (L(to the 2nd power)DB) of design and construction knowledge could improve the naval ship design process. This project will develop a user-friendly, interactive, and intelligent database for documenting and tracking design producibility lessons learned. The ultimate objective is to incorporate the L(to the 2nd power)DB with the ship design database currently under development by the Navy. This integration will provide ship designers with on-line access to both design information and design decision ramifications. During Phase I of this effort, the database element relationships for the L(to the 2nd power)DB will be defined, proof-of-concept database and user-interface prototypes will be built, and an intelligent user-interface component will be investigated.

        "abstract": "1Real-time systems often suffer from performance inconsistent with client needs and expensive revisions late in the development life cycle. This is due to development methods and computer-aided design tools relying heavily on an informal and inaccurate process for communicating requirements. A methodology and supporting tool set is needed to integrate requirement details with a system's design and analysis. This project proposes an intelligent real-time system assissment tool (ExpeR/T) that integrates requirement specification, systems design, software design, and design assessment. It will provide the client and engineer with an automated tool that suggests design improvements when system model analysis detects problems. ExpeR/T utilizes an innovative combination of methods, techniques and concepts which are currently treated as disjoint and separate issues in the technical literature. It combines the concepts of real-time systems analysis, software structured analysis, and English-like requirements specifications. These concepts are integrated through a combination of artificial intellignece experts system rules, graphical system design, English-like requirements specifications, design analysis, and design modeling/simulation. During Phase I, ExpeR/T requirements will be defined, preliminary design of system design diagram transformation and quality evaluation will be performed, and a proof-of-concept ExpeR/T prototype will be developed.",

The discovery of high-temperature superconductors (HTS) has created the opportunity for such circuits to function at unprecedented high temperatures. It is likely that very high speed superconducting integrated circuits operating at 30 to 77 K and based on yttrium-barium-copper-oxide (YBCO) will use Josephson junctions of the SNS type, where N is a metallic oxide which is epitaxial and chemically compatible with YBCO. In this project, we will make and study such metallic oxides, first as thin films to determine their physical properties, then as the N layer of SNS junctions both in the form of trilayer sandwich devices and as so-called edge junctions. We will thus be able to choose the optimum material and device structure to be used in HTS digital circuits.",

        "abstract": "The project objective is to fabricate high-strength shapes from composite materials without the use of dies, molds or any type of dedicated tooling. In the process, a \"forming master\" is created from deformable sheet material on a first pass through the molding apparatus. In successive passes, plies of composite materials are overlaid on the master and consolidated by the apparatus. These sequential layering operations may serve to encapsulate wiring, tubing, optical fibers, sensors, actuators and other functional or structural components. The generation of such \"integrated structures\", without hand labor and without tedious and expensive tooling preparation, is an ultimate objective of the project. Anticipated benefits include rapid modeling, prototyping and eventual mass-manufacture of products, from a wide variety of advanced composite materials, for many applications.",

THIS COMPLICATES AND INCREASES THE COST OF ANY CORRECTIVE ACTION OR MAINTENANCE EFFORTS ON THE INDIVIDUAL BURNERS. BECAUSE OF THIS, THERE IS AN UNFULFILLED REQUIREMENT AND A MARKET NEED IN EMERGING CONTROL/MAINTENANCE TECHNOLOGY TO FINETUNE INDIVIDUAL BURNERS FOR OPTIMUM STOICHIOMETRY AT MINIMUM NITROGEN OXIDES (NOX). THERE IS ALSO A NEED TO QUICKLY CORRECT ANY OUT-OF-SPECIFICATION CONDITIONS. CURRENT TECHNOLOGY CANNOT ASCERTAIN FOR EACH OF MANY COAL BURNERS THAT FIRE INTO A LARGE BOILER WHETHER AN INDIVIDUAL BURNER IS FIRING AT OPTIMAL STOICHIOMETRY AND AT MINIMUM NOX. AN ACOUSTIC SENSOR BEING DEVELOPED IN THIS PROGRAM SHOULD BE ABLE TO FILL THAT NEED. PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) WITH ACOUSTIC SENSING SHOWS THAT THE SOUND POWER LEVEL BETWEEN DIFFERENT COMBUSTION OXYGEN LEVELS VARIES. ADDITIONAL R&D IS REQUIRED BEFORE THIS TECHNOLOGY CAN BE DEVELOPED INTO THE USEFUL PRODUCT FOR WHICH THERE IS SIGNIFICANT COMMERCIAL DEMAND.

        "abstract": "Cr:LiCAF shows potential as an efficient tunable laser with good beam quality at moderate power levels. While efficient laser operation for Cr:LiCAF has been demonstrated in the laboratory, commercialization is impeded because large crystals with low scatter loss are not available. The proposed program is to adapt the Heat Exchanger Method (HEM) for growth of Cr:LiCAF crystals. Since crystal growth by HEM is carried out wih low temperature gradients, the scattering losses in Cr:LiCAF due to defects and variation in stoichiometry are minimized. The submerged solid-liquid interface in HEM minimizes the breakdown of the interface due to the nonstiochiometric phase. The nonstoichiometric phase is rejected to the last material to solidify which is near the crucible wall. Crystal growth by HEM is achieved without moving the crucible, the heat zone, or the crystal. After growth annealing of the crystal is achieved in situ, thereby reducing defect density. This feature of HEM also allows controlled cooldown so that large crystals of Cr:LiCAF may be grown.",

Higher switching frequencies reduce the size of power supplies but existing transformer core materials are forced to operate at low frequency to avoid losses in the transformer core. This proposal identifies a microengineering approach to form a new core material which eliminates these losses by making a laminated magnetic structure with both the magnetic and insulating strips formed by thin film deposition techniques, allowing the structure to be \"microengineered\" with specific properties not available by conventional fabrication techniques. The Phase 1 program will fabricate a transformer which can produce a power supply of unequaled size and performance. Use of a thin film magnetic material in combination with thin film windings on a thin flexible substrate will result in a totally integrated, low profile, highly efficient planar power supply.",

Over the year, the increasingly severe demands of modern naval warfare have produced increasingly quiet systems. Unfortunately, the materials used for the manufacture of elastomeric vibration damping and shock mounts have remained essentially unchanged. Surprisingly, one of the simplest parts of a naval vessel, a simple rubber shock mount, is one of the most unreliable, and be (relative to its purchase price) one of the most expensive to replace. The loss of a vibration shock mount's damping characteristics can result in the reduction in the vessels acoustics, and ultimatly, the loss of the vessel to the fleet when in for repair. New radiation cured elastomers offer low-cost method for the production of noise and shock damping products with exceptional resistance to aging, crack initiation, and crack growth.",

Current methods for surveillance sensors model diffusion in geographically fixed coordinate systems and fail to exploit course/speed nonlinearities, and known dynamic constraints, over time. A stochastic PDE characterizes the transition density of the process, and is supplanted by a sequence of discrete stochastic difference problems. The discrete problems are solved numerically, and an optimal, nonlinear, point-mass filter combines transition density updates with nongaussian observation updates. Operations count, throughput analysis, and comparison with a related filter indicate the filter's feasibility. Applications include multisensor data fusion, runway incursion prevention, tracking in nonradar sectors, and ship collision avoidance.",

Track-before-detect combines multiple images from a single sensor to detect a moving object's trajectory as a whole, versus detecting single snapshots. Fusion of distributed sensor observations improves detectability and reduces false alarms using consistency checks. Communications bandwidth in the distributed system is kept low by transmitting only detection information, not raw data. The result is higher detection and lower false alarm rates via a feasible system architecture with lower sensor and feasible communication requirements. While intended for SDIO's Brillant Pebbles and Brillant Eyes sensors and scenarios, other remote activities will benefit: target recognition, environmental monitoring, and industrial, geophysical, and medical measurements.",

In this Phase I effort, we propose to evaluate 3 alternative techniques which are potential solutions to meeting the requirement, as well as recommend the one which is the most feasible. The 3 techniques include 2 long range, relatively low data rate (100-500 and 1200 bits/sec) configurations, and a short range, relatively high data rate, (10 kbit/sec) configuration. The 2 long range configurations are a multiple convergence zone acoustic data telemetry system that uses Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) or Digital Coded Phase Modulation (DCPM) at data rates of 100-500 bits/sec, and a system that employs a surface RF buoy to relay acoustic data telemetry from a subsea source that uses Frequency Shift Keying (MF$K) modulation at a data rate of 1200 bits/sec. The 3rd, high data rate technique, is intended for short range, low power, Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) applications and uses the QPSK technique at a data rate of 10 kbits/sec. Our evaluation effort will encompass open water tests using existing 1200 bits/sec acoustic modems modified to implement the various modulation schemes and allow us to evaluate various performance factors such as power efficiency, reliability, data accuracy, and transducer design. The deployed system will also allow us to analyze performance under different environmental conditions.",

        "abstract": "1Reliable and continuous power to submarine electronics is essential for mission execution and for the safe operation of the ship. Digital electronics cannot continue operation through even very short power outages cause by bus transfer devices that have historically been sufficient for analog combat systems. The restart and reload that a digital system must execute after a short power interruption and the subsequent confusion that results while operators recover the tactical picture are a hazard to the ship. A central, auctioneered DC power system has been proposed to provide uninterruptable power. This system is heavy, complex, and potentially unreliable. An alternative to the DC system is proposed. High-discharge rate battery technology exists that can support the operation of the combat system through a bus shift transient. Other battery system support only memory; this concept maintains full operation. The battery proposed is manufactured in a shape that allows it to fit unused Format D slots in the Common Electronic Equipment Enclosure used by the AN/BSY-1 and AN/BSY-2. The work proposed establishes the feasibility of the battery unit and demonstrates its operation in a simulated combat system electronic drawer.",

To a certain degree, Navy is locked in a \"vicious cycle\". Since no effective display technology has been available, little work has been done to develop an underlying information management system that will be needed to drive the displays. Conversely, lack of the underlying information system has prevented establishment of a well defined set of requirements for the display components. Delfin proposes to break this cycle by performing a study to define Air Traffic Control Center information system requirements, to prototype elements of such a system using conventional CRT displays, and to identify potential display technology for in-depth testing in Phase II. Delfin can offer to complete this complex effort in Phase I because of our intimate involvement in the Navy Tactical Command System (Afloat) and in-depth knowledge of information management aboard aircraft carriers.",

Each solid state module will be capable of opening and closing tens of amperes at hundreds of volts at high speed. The modules are intrinsically current limiting and short circuit proof. Very high average power densities and speeds have been demonstrated in recent Diversified Technologies Inc. test. The modules require very low standby power and have a low voltage drop under CW high current conditions. The modules are low cost, very compact, shock proof, rugged and long-lived. Using novel technology, the switch modules can, for example, be used individually in tens of kilowatt applications as intelligent, electronically resettable, very high speed DC or AC circuit breakers and contactors, even with highly inductive loads. A prototype circuit breaker module will be built which could be used for DC, 60, 400 or 20 kHz, single or 3 phase, and up to 1 kV.",

        "abstract": "Lithium Hydride is an attractive energy storage material. Its high heat of fusion (2582 kJ/kg) and its melting point (956 K) make it suitable for many applications. The best location for LiH storage capsules is inside a liquid metal heat pipe. The heat pipe facilitates heat transfer into and out of the capsules. The major drawback to using LiH is its high equilibrium hydrogen pressure. Since hydrogen diffuses readily through iron and nickel-based alloys, the expected life time of a heat pipe with a LiH capsule is very low. However, Dynatherm has discovered that the actual hydrogen build-up in a potassium heat pipe with a LiH capsule is much less than predicted. It is postulated that the presence of the alkali metal suppresses hydrogen permeation, probably through the formation of a layer of alkali metal hydride. The objective of Phase I is to verify the initial observation and to quantify the phenomenon. The ultimate objective is to develop alkali metal heat pipes with internal LiH storage which are not sensitive to hydrogen poisoning. Potential commercial applications are solar powered Stirling engines and cooling systems for the leading edges of hypersonic aircraft.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: Future land and amphibian combat vehicles will eschew hydraulically-powered subsystems in favor of direct electric analogues where available to take advantage of the higher inherent efficiencies, reliabilities and safety possible from eliminating a power conversion process using hydraulics. A relatively high-torque, partial turn actuator has been identified as a subsystem needing development. Specifically, an actuator with the following general specifications has been identified as appropriate for the AAAV: * 270 VDC operation * 12,000 inch-pound rotational torque capacity * 180 degrees of rotation * 50 pound weight * 8-inch body diameter * Positive locking capability to full torque with less than 5 degrees slippage * Suitable for operation submerged in seawater * Rotation rate of 3 RPM equivalent under full torque * Combat level reliability In conjunction with a program to develop a high-reliability, long-lived ROV (remotely operated vehicle) for application in the offshore oil industry, Eastport International, Inc.(EII), has been working with a similar group of requirements for an underwater valve adjusting tool. Our proposal is to adapt the elements of this ROV subsystem now undergoing design evaluation to the specific requirements of this SBIR, enhancing the SBIR concept by incorporating ideas already apparent from the ongoing torque tool study.",

Never has a technology blossomed as fast as the EDFA: it went from a twinkle in the eye to a laboratory curiosity to a practical solution to a commercial product in a 2-3 year time span; a true phenomenon. With an EDFA, the loss in any optical system is no longer a constraint and it can be used as a power amplifier and/or preamplifier to increase loss budget and splitting ratio. We will use semiconductor laser diodes in the 800 nm band as the optical pumps and develop EDFA modules which are much cheaper (",

A gas encapsulated in a cavity micromachined on Si expands upon absorption of IR radiation, like a Golay detector, causing a deflection of the cavity wall measured by an electron tunneling probe, micromachined on the same SI wafer. MMW antennas, metal-deposited on the back of the cavity wall, connect to readout/mux electronics processed on the back of the micromachined SI wafer. The electron tunneling probe can measure atomic-sclae deflections, acting as an extremely sensitive transducer sensing IR well beyond 20 microns. The MMW-horn-shaped cavities have walls coated with a thin layer of Au, of receiving MMWs at 94 GHz and beyond. The same pixel detects IR and MMWs simultaneously, and the FPA provides all-weather, all-battle-condition target detection/recognition from clutter with near immunity to countermeasures.",

The MQW and DBR will be fabricated on GaAs substrate in tandem by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The two-dimensional array of the MQW lasers will lase perpendicular to the surface of the substrate and the emitted power from each laser can be controlled independently and coherently. The phase I objective is to design the array layout, the on-chip bias/address circuit and the control processor to operate the array, followed by a demonstration of a small test array. The resultant SEL array will by used for projecting modulated images with high resolution and high dynamic range thus making it ideally suited for high density neural optical computing and optical signal processing applications.",

CURRENT LEAD MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES ARE GRAPHITE FURNACE ATOMIC ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY, X-RAY FLUORESCENCE, OR ANODIC STRIPPING VOLTAMMETRY (ASV). NONE OF THESE METHOD SATISFY SIZE, COST, AND ACCURACY CONSTRAINTS FOR A FIELD DEVICE. ONLY ASC AS THE POTENTIAL TO BE PORTABLE YET SELECTIVE ENOUGH FOR MININUM SAMPLE PREPARATION. ADVANCES IN MICROELECTRODES AND MICROPROCESSORS ARE A VITAL PART OF THE TECHNOLOGY FOR A HAND-HELD DETECTION DEVICE. A SPECIALLY CONSTRUCTED ARRAY OF METAL MICROELECTRODES WILL BE USED FOR STRIPPING (CONCENTRATING) AND DETECTING THE LEAD FROM PAINT. A SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE IN THE ASV WAVE FORM SIMPLIFIES THE CORRESPONDING CONTROL CIRCUITRY. THE ELECTOSYNTHESIS COMPANY, INC.'S OBJECTIVE IS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF CREATING A HAND-HELD LEAD DETECTOR BASED ON MICROELECTRODE TECHNOLOGY. THEY WILL EVALUATE ELECTRODE DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION, AND PERFORMANCE. THE DEVICE WILL BE ABLE TO QUICKLY DETERMINE LEAD IN PAINT RESIDUES AS WELL AS FROM OTHER SOURCES.",

In particular, use of halocarbon species is proposed to investigate the possibility of self-limiting growth of diamond thin films. We will use a movable mechanical barrier to divide the chamber into multiple zones. The zones supply source gas, exited or purging hydrogen.

        "abstract": "SDI requires dual band imaging technology. The approach may provide equivalent performance at far lower cost than discrete element IRFPA technologies. The project will develop a dual band IR imager using its photodichronic imaging (PDI) technology. A sensitive 8 to 12 micron imager has been demonstrated. Similarly designed materials have been demonstrated to be sensitive to different IR spectral bands. PDI involves: 1. modulation of photodichronic properties of one molecular group resulting from optical absorption in another, both groups linked in the molecule by pi electronics which determine response time and modulation characteristics; 2. near perfect molecular organization of these materials onto substrates by the Langmuir-Blodgett (L-B) process; and 3. the extreme sensitivity of ellipsometic techniques used to generate images. Dichronic materials act as both sensor and display, directly converting IR or UV images into visible ones. Images can be viewed directly by the eye, or by means of CCD cameras for missile IR seeker/tracker use. PDI requires no cryocooling, scanning, or electronic signal processing, and is all optical with no moving parts.",

BY DEVELOPING THE TECHNOLOGY NECESSARY TO UTILIZE STATIC NATURAL GAS, THE UNITED STATES CAN INCREASE THE WORLD'S SUPPLY OF ENERGY AND THEREBY DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY SPENT BUYING FOREIGN ENERGY. THE CONVERSION OF STATIC NATURAL GAS (I.E., METHANE (CH4)) TO METHANOL (CH3OH) IS AN ESPECIALLY ATTRACTIVE APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM; AS HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED, A METHANOL-FUELED AUTOMOBILE IS CAPABLE OF NEARLY POLLUTION-FREE OPERATION, WITH ENERGY EFFICIENCY THAT IS 25% TO 40% BETTER THAN THAT OF PRESENT GASOLINE-FUELED AUTOMOBILES. RESEARCHERS HAVE ALSO SHOWN THAT THE NONCATALYTIC OXIDATION OF CH4 CAN PRODUCE CH3OH WITH AN INITIAL YIELD OF 81 PERCENT, BUT THAT THIS YIELD DROPS RAPIDLY WITH INCREASING CH4 CONVERSION. OXIDATION OF METHANE TO METHANOL AT HIGH YIELD AND LOW CONVERSION WILL BE AN ATTRACTIVE PROCESS ONLY IF METHANOL CAN BE RECOVERED AT LOW CONCENTRATIONS WHILE THE SENSIBLE HEAT OF THE GAS FROM WHICH THE METHANOL IS RECOVERED CAN BE CONSERVED. PHASE I PLANS TO DEMONSTRATE A NOVEL SEPARATION TECHNIQUE ON A CONTINUOUS STREAM OF METHANE CONTAINING METHANOL AT A LOW CONCENTRATION.

Unlike ordinary heat sink compounds that rely on powder additives to lower resistance, the carbon fibers offer continuous conduction paths that potentially enable orders of magnitude better performance.

THE CENTRAL IDEA IS THE ISOPERFORMANCE CURVE, WHICH REPORESENTS THE TRADE-OFF RELATIONS AMONG PERSONNEL, TRAINING, AND EQUIPMENT CONSIDERATIONS; HELTH AND SAFETY FACTORS MAY ALSO BE INCLUDED. THE PRESENT PROPOSAL APPLIES THE ISOPERFORMANCE APPROACH TO THE SELECTION OF KEY VARIABLES IN EACH OF THE MANPRINT DOMAINS AS THOSE DOMAINS TAKE SHAPE IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND ACQUISTION OF TRAINING DEVICES. THE KEY STEP WILL BE DETERMINING DEFENSIBLE CRITERIA FOR THE SELECTION OF SOME VARIABLES IN EACH DOMAIN AS KEY. ONCE THIS HAS BEEN DONE, THE EXISTING ISOPERFORMANCE JOB AID (COMPUTER PROGRAM) WILL BE MODIFIED OR REWRITTEN TO IMPLEMENT THE APPLICATION OF THOSE CRITERIA. IN PHASE II, THE JOB AID WILL BE DEVELOPED, DEMONSTRATED, AND BETA TESTED.",

Fiber and Sensor Technologies proposes to develop practical and commercially viable optical fiber sensors for use in active structural vibration control and the dynamic quantitative nondestructive evaluation of advanced aerospace materials. F&S principal investigators have demonstrated initial prototypes of innovative optical fiber sensors for each of these applications. They have developed variable-sensitivity spatially distributed optical fiber sensor methods which void the actuator/observer spillover typical of discrete point sensors and the associated instabilities in closed loop systems.

Strong piezoceramic fibers that can function as load bearing members in structures and survive the large mechanical strains encountered in highly stressed engineering components are not developed. It is envisioned that piezoelectric fabric composites will be produced from the fibers. These composites will be bonded to structures like beams and panels to sense and actively damp in-plane strains which cause noise and vibration. Such fibers are badly needed for the active control of noise and vibration in military structures and vehicles, and are also widely applicable to the civil, commercial and industrial fields where similar problems exist.",

The thermoplastic yarn, when processed through an autoclave cure using high pressure and temperature, will fuse the high modulus carbon fibers together to form a rigid finished component. By incorporating the matrix (PEEK yarn) into the triaxial braiding process, to subsequent impregnation step can be eliminated thus resulting in lower costs. The results of this program will provide an automated demonstration of a reproducible thin-walled structural tube. It will also reveal that thermoplastics can be incorporated into braided structures without expensive processing. In addition, the resulting thermoplastic matrix can be thermally treated to allow for post forming and to facilitate attachment to nodes. Commercially, this product would replace conventional epoxy based structures.",

In particular, the Army is interested in a groung-based millimeter wave missile launcher radar that will track its missile and the target, then issue differential guidance commands to the missile. The problem is that it is difficult to track targets at low elevation because both the target and its reflected image are somtines both in the antenna's main beam. Flam & Russell, Inc. (FR) understands the problem because it has built monopulse antennas. FR is confident it can solve the problem because it has built modern direction finding systems that specialize in finding signals in multipath. The proposed solution consists of combining the squinted beams available from a monopulse antenna using variants of modern direction finding algorithms and advances in millimeter wave hardware. FR proposes to evaluate several strong candidate solutions through analysis and simulation, consider the ease of hardware implementation, and choose the algorithm that performs best in theory and has a change of being built with modern hardware.",

        "abstract": "1To produce and maintain product quality we contend that one must control the development and maintenance processess through the collection, examination and analysis of both process and product indicators. Process indicators provide measures that reflect the effectiveness of software development and maintenance activities. Product indicators provide measures that indicate the extent to which desirable, quality attributes are present (or absent) in the product (documentation and code). Establishing process control requires a foundational underpinning that (a) reflects a complementary integration of maintenance and development activities, (b) the identification and definition of a (semi-) automated data collection and analysis process which employs quality indicators that are definitively linkded to the existance of process and product attributes, the use of acceptable software engineering principles, and (c) the formulation and use of control methods that are designed to work within the defined automated process and to provide decision support capabilities. Based on previous experience, and building on our previous research results, we propose to define a foundation that can be used as a springboard for establishing software development process control. Results from this effort are expected to make significant contributions to software engineering technology by providing a blueprint by which organizations can establish a controlled software development process.",

        "abstract": "Modern seeker systems that employ multispectrum technology to optimize missile guidance performance are limited by the available volume. Specifically, placement of an IR seeker in the nose of an RF seeker radome creates blockage effects that vary as a function of the angle of the gimballed RF seeker. The resulting imbalances in the antenna aperture and associated losses can degrade tracking performance. It is desired to optimize the average tracking performance over all seeker/target aspect angles, or preferably, to optimize performance at each required operational aspect angle. The proposal detailed herein describes the use of digital beamforming (DBF) arrays as a means to allow the aperture illumination to be optimized at each aspect angle in the presence of symmetrical or asymmetrical blockage such as presented by an IR seeker. The DBF concept also allows for individual optimization of the sum and difference pattern weights of a monopulse tracking seeker. In addition, calibration techniques allow for the relaxation of RF component performance requirements.",

Development of new organic or inorganic photorefractive materials which are fast and highly nonlinear has been hindered by the necessity for photoconductivity, the electro-optic effect, and partially full deep traps.

This increases weight, size, drag and detectability if the coating is damaged. Foster-Miller proposes to reduce the acoustic coating requirement more than 60% by making the composite structures intrinsically energy-absorbing. In Phase I, we will combine commercial materials to produce a semi-interpenetrating network (SIPN) epoxy/elastomer resin that maintains structural integrity because of separated phase morphology, absorbs energy over a broad range of frequencies (100 to 4000 Hz) and temperatures (-10 C to 40 C) and is processible via filament winding. We will apply our experience in undersea acoustic materials, polymer design, polymer synthesis and composite processing to provide the Navy with a complete evaluation of key technical issues, including: tailoring the SIPN in both acoustic and structural properties, processing the SIPN into composites and measuring acoustic and mechanical properties. Phase I will demonstrate the feasibility of producing \"silent\" composites that maintain the strength and stiffness of unmodified composites. In Phase II, we will refine the process and filament-wind prototype 21 in., heavy-walled composite tubes, 48 in. in length, with end fittings for testing at NUSC.",

Due to the harsh environment to which those fasteners are subjected locking systems for threaded connections are seriously critical to aircraft integrity. The most challenging environmental issue is the timperature range (-65F to +800F) in which the thread locking system must perform. Aircraft of mie-twentieth century design relied heavily on mechanical locking techniques, such as lockwires and castellated nuts, but the skill and time required for proper installation is excessive. Later, locking nuts fitted with nylon patches of rings were developed, however the inferent problems of limited temperature range and low reusability have not been surmounted. Likewise, all-metal self-locking nuts have serious shortcomings, skuch as limited vibration resistance and mechanical thread destruction. The proposed effort employs shape memory alloy (SMA) as the licking mechanism. By cleverly exploiting the recovery of SMA to its original form, adaptive locking mechanisms can be developed that provide extensive allowable reuse, a preatly enhanced temperature range, and superior locking force for improved vibration dampoing.",

The current pure copper SEM-D heat sink limits the power dissipation per card to 26W in order to maintain acceptable device junction temperatures. Foster-Miller will demonstrate an innovative Gr/Cu metal matrix composite (MMC) heat sink which offers a 25 percent reduction in thermal impedance over the current copper component. The key bottleneck for MMCa-low z-directional conductivity-will be removed by adding z-directional fibers to the planar preform using a Foster-Miller proprietary process. Additionally, the MMC heat sink will have a tailored planar CTE in the card region (thereby obviating a complaint layer) and high planar thermal conductivity. The cumulative effect will be a 6 to 10 C reduction in the device junction temperature (thereby >50 percent reduction in device failure rate) for the same power density, or alternatively, a 25 percent increase in the power dissipation at current device junction temperatures. Additionally, the 45 percent lighter Gr/Cu heat sink will accrue significant savings in the electronics system and structural weight. During Phase I Foster-Miller will fabricate and test MMC specimens representative of three critical regions-card, rib and bend region; of the Foster-Miller SEM-D heat sink concept. This will lead into Phase II when the design and processing will be optimized and high properties will be consistently demonstrated in full scale Gr/Cu SEM-D heat sinks.",

It is therefore the best candidate for laser protection, but has not been applied to laser protection because large, highly oriented optical films of BR are not available. F-M will apply innovative processes to purified BR, such as electric field deposition, isopotential spin-drying, epitaxially-directed film growth and delipidization to produce high clarity and concentration BR films.",

STEAM GENERATOR TUBES, CONSEQUENTLY, DESERVE, AND RECEIVE SPECIAL CONSIDERATION. THE ASSURANCE OF STEAM GENERATOR TUBE INTEGRITY IS THE GOAL OF THE INSERVICE INSPECTION PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES FOR PERIODIC TUBE EXAMINATIONS WHICH ARE TYPICALLY PERFORMED BY EDDY CURRENT TESTING (ECT). ALTHOUGH ECT HAS PROVEN TO BE VERY GOOD AT DETECTING AND QUANTIFYING GENERAL WASTAGE, SOME FORMS OF TUBE DAMAGE ARE BEYOND THE CAPABILITY OF THE STATE-OF-THE-ART OF ECT. THE RECENT EXPERIENCE OF PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC AT THE TROJAN NUCLEAR POWER PLANT IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS. TUBING SAMPLES REMOVED FROM THE TROJAN STEAM GENERATORS WERE INSPECTED USING THE MOST UP-TO-DATE ECT EQUIPMENT AND PROCEDURES AVAILABLE. THIS TESTING DETECTED NO DEGRADATION OF THE TUBE WALLS IN THE SUPPORT PLATE INTERSECTIONS. WHEN THE TUBE SAMPLES WERE SUBJECTED TO METALLURGICAL EXAMINATION, HOWEVER, THEY WERE FOUND TO CONTAIN TIGHT, AXIAL CRACKS, WHICH PENETRATED AS MUCH AS 70% THROUGH WALL. SUBSEQUENT BURST TESTING VERIFIED THAT THE TUBING HAD MAINTAINED ADEQUATE STRENGTH DESPITE THE CRACKS, BUT THE FAILURE TO DETECT THEM BY ECT MUST BE ADDRESSED. THE POTENTIAL EXISTS TO SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVE THE DETECTION AND CHARACTERIZATION CAPABILITY OF EXISTING ECT BY PERFORMING THE INSPECTION IN THE PRESENCE OF A THERMALLY INDUCED TENSILE STRESS. THE TENSILE STRESS WOULD SERVE TO OPEN THE TIGHT CRACKS SUFFICIENTLY TO PERMIT THEIR DETECTION BY ECT.

        "abstract": "ON FEBRUARY 9, 1991, AT THE MIHAMA UNIT 2 NUCLEAR POWER STATION, OPEARTED BY KANSAI ELECTRIC CORPORATION, A STEAM GENERATOR TUBE RUPTURED AND RELEASED APPROXIMATELY 9,000 GALLONS OF REACTOR COOLANT INTO THE SECONDARY SYSTEM. THE LEAKAGE CAUSED A RAPID DEPRESSURIZATION OF THE REACTOR COOLANT SYSTEM, WHICH RESULTED IN AN AUTOMATIC REACTOR TRIP AND ACTUATION OF THE HIGH PRESSURE SAFETY INJECTION SYSTEM. THIS WAS THE FIRST ACTUATION OF AN EMERGENCY CORE COOLING SYSTEM COMPONENT EXPERIENCED BY THE JAPANESE NUCLEAR POWER INDUSTRY. A STEAM GENERATOR TUBE RUPTURE HAS SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE TO PLANT SAFTEY BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS THE SIMULTANEOUS LOSS OF TWO OF THE THREE BARRIERS TO THE RELEASE OF FISSION PRODUCTS TO THE ATMOSPHERE. WHEN A STEAM GENERATOR TUBE FAILS, BOTH THE REACTOR COOLANT SYSTEM AND THE CONTAINMENT BUILDING ARE BREACHED. THIS EVENT IS VERY SIMILAR TO A TUBE RUPTURE WHICH OCCURRED AT NORTH ANNA UNIT 1 ON JULY 15, 1987. LIKE THE MIHAMA 2 EVENT, THE PRIMARY-TO-SECONDARY LEAKAGE WAS THE RESULT OF THE COMPLETE SEVERANCE OF A SINGLE TUBE IMMEDIATELY ABOVE THE UPPERMOST (7TH) TUBE SUPPORT PLATE ON THE COLD LEG SIDE. ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT THE TUBE FAILED AS A RESULT OF HIGH CYCLE FATIGUE, WITH THE FATIGUE CRACKS ORIGINATING ON THE OD SURFACE. IT WAS CONCLUDEDTHAT THE TUBE HAD EXPERIENCED FLUID ELASTIC INSTABILITY WHICH HAD CAUSED LARGE U-BEND DEFLECTIONS AND AN ALTERNATING STRESS LEVEL SUFFICIENT TO INITIATE FATIGUE CRACKING. DESPITE THE IMPORTANCE OF NATURAL FREQUENCY AND DAMPING IN DETERMINING THE MARGIN TO FLUID ELASTIC EXCITATION, NOT MUCH IS KNOWN ABOUT ACTUAL TUBE FIXITY CONDITIONS IN AN OPERATING STEAM GENERATOR. IT IS SUSPECTED THAT DEPOSITS WHICH ACCUMULATE IN THE TUBE SUPPORT PLATE HAVE AN EFFECT ON TUBE FIXITY AND THEREFORE ON THE FLUID ELASTIC STABILITY MARGIN. HOWEVER, THE EXTREMELY LIMITED SUCCESS AND THE RADIATION FIELDS WHICH ARE PRESENT PRECLUDE THE USE OF EXISTING VIBRATION MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS.

        "abstract": "1Advanced composite materials such as carbon/epoxy are prone to delamination or splitting between the piles caused by handling or service impacts. Delamination is often internal and is difficult to detect even with sophisticated instrumentation. Critical components must be designed for conservative stress levels because of the possibility of an undetected delamination. Preventing delamination or limiting propagation under load would save weight through higher design allowables, and would reduce inspection, repair and replacement costs. Foster-Miller has recently developed a process to transversely reinforce composites on-tool in the autoclave. Our initial tests results indicate that the method has the potential to significantly reduce delamination in carbon-epoxy, and also to eliminate or reduce some of the problems related to mechanical fasteners. We have recently shown that through thickness (T2) reinforcement with carbon fibers improves mode I fracture toughness ten times in AS4/3501-6. Unlike stitching, the method does not adversely affect the in-plane properties. In the proposed program we plan to conclusively demonstrate these advantages through a logical sequence of activities leading to fabrication and service testing of a T2 reinforced component for a Navy aircraft in Phase II. This effort will involve the support and participation of McDonnell Aircraft Co.",

In Phase I, methods are addressed to increase energy density of the all-solid capacitors to 15 kJ/kg by decreasing the particle size and improving the ionomer coating of the alloy noble/transition metal oxide particulates used to fabricate the electrodes. In Phase II, capacitor packaging, scale-up and extension of the unique structure to longer-duration power applications of interest to SDI will be investigated. Possible uses include military (defensive weapons, fast switching devices), CMOS memory backup and load leveling.",

The proposed approach will apply theme techniques to enhance Gignal to noise and bearing resolution despite (a) uncertainties in the knowledge of the 9onar trajectory, (b) inaccurate estimates of the speed of sound as a function of depth, and (c) unknown target trajectories. Self-cohering (auto-focusing) techniques are used to adaptively compensate for the errors caused by deviation of the target and array trajectories from a linear path, and also for inaccuracies in the estimated speed of sound. A series of wideband pulsee are transmitted towardm the target area; the large bandwidth breakB up the ABM target into several range cells. Two self-cohering algorithms that have been successful in synthetic and inverse synthetic aperture radar, called the dominant scatterer algorithm and the 9patial correlation algorithm, are used to extract the corrections needed to compensate the errors from the measured echoes. The bearing coordinate of the image formed after applying the self-cohering corrections to the data will be ecaled and shifted if the target trajectory in not known. E9timatea of the target trajectory can be ueed to remove this distortion.",

        "abstract": "The RF transmitter/locator (TL) concept presented in this proposal enables the location and recovery of a canister such as a nose cone, artillery shell, buoy, or instrument package. The system operates over a distance of 5 mi on the surface and several hundred feet through soil, sand, or fresh water. The RF TL is battery-powered, small in size, highly shock resistant, and it consumes a minimum amount of power. It operates at a selectable frequency with a programmable delay to conserve power. While line-of-sight (LOS) communication on or above the surface requires little power and a minimal antenna, through-the-earth communications (TEC) subjects the signal to significant attenuation. The feasibility of a low-power, miniature TEC transmitter therefore depends upon optimization of the system parameters (frequency, modulation, operating mide), receiver (noise cancellation), and transmitter (antenna and power amplifier). The proposed program therefore first reviews and optimizes various aspects of the system, including near-field location techniques, VLF (TEC) link, HF(surface-to-surface) link, and transmitting antenna. It then addresses key implementation issues including transmitter organization, ASIC implementation, and receiver considerations. The end result will be a feasibility determination and preliminary design of the system and hardware for the RF transmitter/locator.",

WE DISCUSS THESE CHALLENGES AND THE SIMULATION CONCEPTS THAT CAN QUANTIFY THE UTILITY OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND QUALIFY THEIR TACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. WE DESCRIBE THE DRIVING REQUIREMENTS FOR DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING AN APPROPRIATE SIMULATION NETWORK ENVIRNONMENT; A MULTIDIMENSIONAL ADVERSARY SIMULATION NETWORK THAT IS AN INTELLIGENTLY INTERACTIVE, REAL-TIME MANNED AND UNMANNED ADVERSARY SIMULATION CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING SYSTEMS REQUIREMENTS EVALUATION EFFORTS. DISCUSSED ARE THE VARIOUS WAYS IN WHICH SUCH A SIMULATION TECHNOLOGY CAN BE LEVERAGED TO SUPPORT EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS THE DARPA X-31 EFM DEMONSTRATOR, AND OTHER EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES. DEVELOPMENT OF A SIMULATION NETWORK ENVIRONMENT CAN SERVE AS THE CONDUIT FOR LINKING ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY AND SIMULATION AND CAN PROVIDE FOR THE IMPROVED EXPLORATION OF THE VALID DEFINITION OF OPERATIONAL AND TACTICAL UTILITY TO BE PROVIDED BY A TECHNOLOGY. USING AN INTERACTIVE FLIGHT VEHICLE/GROUND SIMULATOR NETWORK, THE GOVERNMENT IS OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY TO SCRUB REQUIREMENTS AND EVALUATE EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND TACTICS, THROUGH AN UNMANNED BALANCED-FIDELITY ADVERSARY REPRESENTATION AND A MANNED FLIGHT SIMULATOR OR AIRBORNE AIR VEHICLE. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS - RESULTS OF THIS RESEARCH WILL PROVIDE THE TECHNICAL FOUNDATION FOR ESTABLISHING REQUIREMENTS FOR A PROTOTYPE, LOW COST AIR COMBAT SIMULATION NETWORK UTILIZING TWO-WAY RF DATA-LINK AND OTHER ADVANCED INTERFACE TECHNOLOGIES. THIS SYSTEM WILL BE USEFUL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION OF FUTURE TECHNOLOGIES TO SUPPORT ADVANCED AIR COMBAT.

The SC thus provides both trigger and energy for polymer switching. Preliminary data for SC/CP switching shows sub-ns risetimes and falltimes in the tens of ns, with large OD changes (ca. 2.0 at 532 nm).",

PROVIDE AUTOMATIC SYSTEM GENERATION CAPABILITIES AND AN EASY-TO-USE QUERY INTERFACE. * ALLOW EASY EXPANSION TO DOMAIN SPECIFIC TOPIC AREAS. THE DARPA PROTOTYPE SYSTEM ADDRESSES THE SOLICITATION REQUIREMENTS OF FREE TEXT RETRIEVAL AND DYNAMIC ADAPTATION, AND HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED ON TEXT CORPORA OF OVER 10,000 DOCUMENTS. HOWEVER, THIS SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE ENHANCED TO ADDRESS THE REQUIREMENTS OF AUTOMATIC INDEXING, CATALOGING, AND S U MM ARI Z A TI O N . HNC PROPOSES TO ADDRESS THESE ENHANCEMENTS BY EXTENDING THE EXISTING DKUM SYSTEM TO INCLUDE AUTOMATIC INDEX TERM GENERATION AND AUTOMATIC SUMMARIZATION OF DOCUMENTS.

HNC proposes a program to develop an optimal pattern recognition methodology based on a comparison and combination of the existing methodologies. This requires the evaluation and improvement of existing ATR algorithms and architectures. In Phase I, HNC will focus on two major tasks: comparison of different methodologies and building a prototype integrated ATR system using the optimal pattern recognition methodology. The comparison task is to identify capabilities and limitations of the existing ATR algorithms/systems. In particular, data type, requirements, assumptions, speed, reliability, and performance will be carefully reviewed. Based on this initial investigation, modifications to expand the capabilities of existing ATR algorithms/systems will be carried out. Then, an integrated ATR system with low false alarm rate and high detection probability will be built based on the existing and improved ATR algorithms/systems examined in the first task.",

THE TRADITIONAL METHOD HAS BEEN TO CAPTURE THE MRNA, WHICH HAS LONG REPEATS OF ADENINES (A) AT ITS 3' END, BY USING IMMOBILIZED OLIGO (DT) (16-30 THYMIDINES LONGS), AND THEN WASH AWAY THE RRNA WHICH DOES NOT BIND. THIS WORK WILL PROVIDE A WAY TO REMOVE RRNA FROM RNA PREPARATIONS, LEAVING THE MRNA. THIS WILL BE DONE BY PASSING THE RNA PREPARATIONS OVER BEADS THAT HAVE OLIGONUCLEOTIDES (THESE ARE SHORT SINGLE STRANDED DEOXYNUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCES) ATTACHED TO THEM WHICH ARE COMPLEMENTARY TO CONSERVED SEQUENCE OF RRNA. IN THIS WAY THE RRNA WILL BE BOUND AND MRNA WILL FLOW THROUGH. THIS NEW METHOD WILL BE ATTRACTIVE TO RESEACHERS AND THUS HAVE COMMERCIAL APPLICATION BECAUSE IT WILL PROVIDE A BETTER WAY TO OBTAIN MRNA. FIRST, THE YIELDS OF MRNA SHOULD BE HIGHER SINCE EVEN MRNA WITH SHORT POLY A TAILS WILL BE ISOLATED. SECONDLY, IT GIVES RESEARCHERS ACCESS TO NONPOLYADENYLATED MRNA'S WHICH ARE LOST IN THE OLIGO (DT) COLUMN METHOD.",

Also, fixtures have been provided to use the implant ion's charge as well as an electron shower to control the wafer and particle potentials, to facilitate the removal of particles by electrostatic force.

THE NIOBIUM (NB) BARRIER THICKNESS WAS INTRODUCED IN EARLY SSC CONDUCTORS TO PREVENT INTERACTION BETWEEN COPPER (CU) AND THE NIOBIUM-TITANIUM (NBTI) FILAMENTS. AS MORE AGGRESSIVE HEAT TREATMENTS WERE EMPLOYED AND FILAMENT SIZES WERE REDUCED, THE THICKNESS OF THIS BARRIER BECAME INADEQUATE AND BOTH COPPER AND TITANIUM DIFFUSED THROUGH THE BARRIER. THE SUGGESTED SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM WAS TO THICKEN THE BARRIER, BUT THIS, IF CARRIED TO THE EXTREME, HAD AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE OVERALL JC. RECENTLY, IN WORK DIRECTED PRIMARILY TOWARDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF MATERIALS FOR ALTERNATING CURRENT APPLICATIONS, IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT WHEN SILICON IS ADDED TO THE COPPER MATRIX, THE INTERDIFFUSION CAN BE GREATLY REDUCED. THE USE OF THIS APPROACH IN ADVANCED MATERIALS FOR THE SSC AND OTHER ACCELERATOR MAGNETS MAY REDUCE THE NECESSITY FOR THICK BARRIERS, REDUCE THE VOLUME OF INERT MATERIAL, AND INCREASE OVERALL JC.

        "abstract": "Phase I work wil focus on developing a stabilizer which surrounds the high temperature superconductor, with improved mechanical strength. To date, silver (Ag) has been the preferred stabilizer because it allows oxygen to easily penetrate during heat treatments and does not adversely react with the HTS material, decreasing the superconducting properties. However, the mechanical properties of annealed silver is much lower than that of the HTS ceramic material. This mechanical disparity can cause difficulty in processing and is especially important for successful fabrication of uniform long lengths of high Jc superconducting wire and tape. In addition to high current density and useful characteristics, especially mechanical handleability and strenghts, the cost of conductor will be key for many, if not most of the applications for high temperature operation. The fraction of expensive materials, such as silver will have to be reduced in order to provide the economic incentive and advantages provided by lower cost operation at higher temperatures.",

WHILE A DESIRABLE CHARACTERISTIC OF A VACCINE OR IMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC REAGENT IS THAT IN ADDITION TO ANTIBODY, IT INDUCES A CTL RESPONSE, ATTEMPTS TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL HAVE BEEN INEFFECTIVE OR UNSAFE. THE INDUCTION OF CLASS I-RESTRICTED CTL RESPONSES IS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY DICTATED BY A PATHWAY IN WHICH CYTOPLASMIC PROTEINS SYNTHESIZEDWITHIN VIRUS INFECTED CELLS, OR BY SOLUBLE ANTIGENS OSMOTICALLY LOADED INTO THE CYTOPLASM ARE EXPRESSED AT THE SURFACE OF THE CELL IN ASSOCIATION WITH MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX (MHC) CLASS I MOLECULES. THE USE OF PURE, WELL-DEFINED, ANTIGENS AS IMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC AGENTS FOR THE INDUCTION OF BOTH CELLULAR AND HUMORAL IMMUNE RESPONSES IS DESIRABLE. HOWEVER, IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO INDUCE MHC CLASS I-RESTRICTED CTLS IN RESPONSE TO A SOLUBLE ANTIGEN. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER A NOVEL, NON-TOXIC, CHEMICALLY DEFINED, ADJUVANT FORMULATION CAN BE USED TO INDUCE BOTH CLASS I-RESTRICTED CTLS AND HUMORAL RESPONSES AGAINST SOLUBLE PROTEIN ANTIGENS (INCLUDING HIP GP120). WE WILL ALSO EVALUATE WHETHER CTLS ELICITED BY THE ADJUVANT ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE INDUCED BY OTHER ESTABLISHED METHODS INCLUDING THE RECOMBINANT VACCINIA VIRUS TECHNIQUE OR BY SPLEEN CELLS CYTOPLASMICALLY LOADED WITH SOLUBLE ANTIGENS. THIS INVESTIGATION WILL FUNCTION AS A PRELUDE TO THE PHASE II STUDY IN WHICH WE PLAN TO TEST THE FORMULATION IN NON-HUMAN PRIMATES. SUCH A FORMULATION MAY BE USED TO TREAT, BOTH THERAPEUTICALLY AND PROPHYLACTICALLY, VARIOUS VIRAL DISEASES, INCLUDING HIV INFECTION, AND WE ANTICIPATE THE WORK WILL LEAD TO IMPROVED STRATEGIES FOR VACCINE DESIGN.",

The method should be capable of noncontact measuring of surface stresses, scanning and recording stress fields due to static and dynamic loads, and producing color stress plots which can be compared to finite element analysis. A portable PC-based ultrasonic C-scan instrument with air-coupled transducers is proposed to meet these specifications. Ultrasonics provides a direct relationship between the elastic properties of materials, which encompasses stress, and sound wave propagation. This relationship is readily modeled, predicted, and quantified using finite element analysis. Phase I will demonstrate feasibility of a noncontact ultrasonic method to measure surface stress distribution on naval structures. This will lead to the development, during Phase II, of a prototype instrument for use on naval structures in shipyard, shipboard, and laboratory environments.",

While BeCN2 might itself be an important semiconductor material, it might also be able to support the growth of single crystal diamond films. Under this project, an indepth literature study is to be performed to assess the best methods and conditions for the synthesis of BeCN2. Preliminary experiments of BeCN2 formation using two techniques are planned.",

We believe these two are the most promising techniques for producing large hauls, of beta-SiC, suitable for use as substrates for epitaxial growth of beta-SiC thin films. In the top-seeded solution growth method, pure silicon will be used as the solvent. The growth chamber will be pressurized up to 1000 psi to increase the solubility of carbon in the silicon melt. The growth temperature will be below 2OOO\\'C, which is the phase transformation temperature of SiC from beta to alpha phase. In the sublimation method, SiC powder contained inside a graphite cavity will be vaporized by induction heating. Vapor species are transported to and deposited onto closely lattice- matched single crystal seeds of CVD-grown beta-SiC or bulk TiC. Crystals of beta-SiC that are grown will be well characterized with respect to crystal perfection. The growth technique that proves more promising will be further developed and optimized in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Anti-missile radars require high voltage pulse-power switching at high average powers on the order of 100 kilowatts. Physically large, slow-to-warm-up switch tubes have been needed to handle the necessary peak currents. Integrated Applied Physics' BLT-250, a miniaturized hydrogen thyratron employing a novel, fast-warm-up \"super-emissive\" cathode, can switch many 10s of kiloamperes of peak current in a small (2 1/2\" diameter) envelope, making the device a strong candidate to replace heavy, bulky, conventional thyratrons, provided that ways can be found to spread and remove the many kilowatts of heat dissipation now concentrated in the miniaturized devices. In this program, novel methods for removing heat from miniature power tubes will be investigated. Success in removing highly concentrated average-power heat dissipation from the BLT will make practical smaller, lighter,faster-responding, and more powerful radar modulators, laser drivers, and other pulse power equipment.",

THE INFECTION CARRIES AN ASSOCIATION MORTALITY RATE OF 0.5%, AND RECENT ESTIMATED BY TH INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE PLACE THE NUMBER OF HOSPITALIZATIONS IN THE U.S. SECONDARY TO RSV INFECTION AT APPROXIMATELY 91,000 ANNUALLY. THE ASSOCIATED MEDICAL COST OF THE DISEASE IS ROUGHLY $300,000,000. VACCINATION ATTEMPTS TO PREVENT INFECTION HAVE UNIFORMLY FAILED. INDEED, CONVENTIONAL VACCINE METHODOLOGY RESULTED IN MORE SEVERE RESPIRATORY MANIFESTATIONS IN VACCINE RECIPIENTS COMPARED TO UNVACCINATED CONTROLS. INTRA-NASAL ANTI-IDIOTYPIC (ANTI-ID) VACCINATION, ON THE OTHER HAND, SEEMS IDEALLY SUITED TO GENERATE PASSIVE IMMUNITY IN THE NASAL MUCOSA OF AT RISK INFANTS. THE FUSION (F) PROTEIN OF THE VIRUS IS LARGELY (IF NOT ENTIRELY) RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INFECTIVITY OF RSV, AND IS KNOWN TO POSSESS NOR MORE THAN FOUR NEUTRALIZING EPITOPES. NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES TO THE F PROTEIN OF BOVINE RSV HAVE RECENTLY BEEN REPORTED (KLUCAS AND ANDERSON, 1988). SINCE SUBSTANTIAL HOMELOGY EXISTS BETWEEN THE F PROTEIN OF BRSV AND HRSV, WE WILL UTILIZE THESE ANTIBODIES TO GENERATE A HUMAN ANTI-ID TO UTILIZE AS A VACCINE FOR INFANTS. WE HAVE GENERATED ANTI-ID ANTIBODIES AGAINST THESE ANTI-F ANTIBODIES, AND HAVE SHOWN THAT HUMAN SERA (RECENTLY EXPOSED TO RSV) RECOGNIZES THE MURINE ANTI-IDS. WE HAVE FURTHER SHOWN THAT THIS BINDING IS INHIBITED BY ANTI-F. THE IMPLICATION OF THESE RESULTS IS THAT HUMAN SERA CONTAIN ANTIBODIES ANALOGOUS TO THE ORIGINAL ANTI-F. WE WILL CREATE HYBRIDOMAS WHICH SECRETE HUMAN ANTIBODIES AGAINST ANTI-F TO BE UTILIZED AS AN INTRA-NASAL VACCINE.",

A NOVEL FEATURE OF THIS APPROACH IS TO IDENTIFY THE PROCESS BY USING THE HIDDEN MARKOV MODEL (HMM), WHICH HAS BEEN USED EXTENSIVELY IN SPEECH RECOGNITION. HMMS PROVIDE A NATURAL MEANS TO USE DATA FOR IDENTIFYING A COMPLEX, UNCERTAIN, NONLINEAR SYSTEM SUCH AS A PROCESSING PLANT. IN PHASE I, THE HMM METHODOLOGY IS BEING EXTENDED FOR CONTROL SYSTEM DESIGN, TRAINED WITH SIMULATED AND ACTUAL DATA, AND TESTED. A SECOND RELATED OBJECTIVE, MORE SUITED TO PHASE II, IS DEVELOPMENT OF COMPUTER-AIDED CONTROL ENGINEERING (CACE) DESIGN TOOLS THAT APPEAL TO THE NEEDS OF PROCESS CONTROL ENGINEERS. DESPITE MANY THEORETICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL ADVANCES IN THE CONTROL SCIENCES, THERE REMAINS A SUBSTANTIAL GAP IN ITS APPLICATION BY ENGINEERS IN THE PROCESS INDUSTRIES, WHERE SUCH A DESIGN APPROACH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE PRODUCTIVITY. WITH THE APPROPRIATE CACE TOOLS, THESE ENGINEERS CAN PERFORM SOPHISTICATED DESIGNS WITHOUT DEMANDING SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN SKILL LEVEL. SUCH TOOLS ALSO EXTEND THE LIFE CYCLE OF CONTROL DESIGNS, DECREASING THE NEED FOR MAINTENANCE OF CONTROL LOOPS. THE OVERALL BENEFIT TO THE PROCESS INDUSTRIES IS IMPROVED PERFORMANCE FROM AUTOMATION PROJECTS, WHICH ENABLES MORE PROFITABLE, CLEANER, AND SAFER OPERATION OF PROCESS PLANTS.",

Reference NavSea 0900-LP-089-5010, 29 August, 1977, \"Navy Resilient Mount Handbook and Specification\" and Mil Spec #D-24709 (SH) \"Dim Isolation Pads.\" However, today in submarines, where space is critical, more and more electronic cabinetry producing higher frequency signals that are critical, and life cycle cost of resilient mounts (sag, shift, and drift) is excessively high has created a requirement for low loss (damped) mount systems. There are many applications where the standard mounts do not do the job. DARPA recognized this problem over three years ago and issued an RFQ for developments of low loss (damped) mount systems. My information is that this was never awarded. There are standard damped mounts available from several manufacturers and literally hundreds have been used in submarines without a Mil Specification. It is proposed to develop an initial handbook of sizes and loads available, applicable to the Navy applications where a damped mount system is required. Also, to develop a Mil spec for these mounts.",

Program Support Library and Configuration Management tools and practices will be examined for their ability to maintain project status and metrics required for a mature software organization in a small company. The proposed model would be a methodology independent model for the management of the software development process. In addition to specifying documentation requirements, the proposed model would determine the suitability, as measured against a mature software development process, of current project related practices, such as generating productivity summaries and percent completion reports, current status of the development process, and metrics for use by project managers and overseers in evaluating cost and schedule impacts of proposed system changes.",

In this proposal a work plan is put together for a system to perform Automatic Target Recognition utilizing primitive subobjects as components of the complex objects. This will include devising an integrated model for recognizing complex objects with component identification at an intervening level. The major modules of the model are already constructed at Jireh Systems. A large part of the Phase I project will be aimed at integration of the modules. The model will be implemented on a workstation for a small problem set and demonstrated in Phase I. A final report will describe the resultant model and demonstration results. An important component of any such system is the intelligent sequential control of parallel recognition processes as demonstrated in higher vertebrate animals. Neural networks are proposed for the parallel recognition process while both neural networks and rule based systems are being considered for the sequential control processes.",

THIS PROJECT EXPLORES AN INNOVATIVE LASER HYGROMETER THAT WILL BE COMBINED WITH EITHER A SONIC ANEMOMETER OR A LASER DOPPLER ANEMOMETER TO PROVIDE AN ALL-SOLID-STATE SENSOR SYSTEM WITH NO MOVING PARTS FOR MEASURING MARINE BOUNDARY LAYER WATER VAPOR FLUX. THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THE LASER HYGROMETER ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE USED IN UNDERSEA FIBER OPTIC CABLES DESIGNED FOR 10 YEARS OF AUTONOMOUS OPERATION. USE OF A NONCONTACT HUMIDITY-SENSING TECHNIQUE MEANS THAT THE SAPPHIRE WINDOWS ARE THE ONLY SENSOR ELEMENTS THAT REQUIRE CONTACT WITH THE HARSH MARINE ENVIRONMENT. RESPONSE TIMES OF 10 TO 20 HZ ARE TYPICAL, AND THE RESPONSE TIME IS FUNDAMENTALLY LIMITED ONLY BY THE SPEED AT WHICH THE AMBIENT WIND FLUSHES THE SMALL SAMPLE VOLUME. THE HUMIDITY MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUE IS SUFFICIENTLY STABLE AND RELIABLE TO ALLOW A SINGLE SENSOR TO BE USED FOR MEASUREMENTS OF BOTH WATER VAPOR FLUX AND STEADY-STATE HUMIDITY.

THE TASKS INCLUDE DEVELOPMENT OF: (1) MANUFACTURING PROCESS ONTOLOGIES, (2) A CONSTRAINT-LINKED NETWORK OF BUSINESS PROCESS MODELS, (3) INTER-MODEL CONSTRAINT REPRESENTATIONS, (4) REPESENTATIONS FOR THE CONSTRAINT-LINKED NETWORK OF BUSINESS PROCESS MODELS, (5) A PROOF OF CONCEPT PROTOTYPE QUALITATIVE REASONER FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE IMPACT PREDICTION, AND (6) AN ARCHITECTURE TO IMPLEMENT THE CIBR CONCEPT. PHASE I RESULTS WILL PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR A MORE DETAILED CHARACTERIZATION OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE IMPACTS, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF QUANTITATIVE TOOLS SUCH AS SIMULATION MODELING SUPPORT. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: SINCE CONTINUOUS AND PERVASIVE CHANGE WILL BE THE PROMINENT CHARACTERISTICS OF THE COMING INFORMATION AGE, THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGY TO MANAGE CHANGE WILL LIKELY DISTINGUISH SUCCESS FROM ORGANIZATIONAL FAILURE. THE CONCEPTS AND METHODS THAT WILL EMERGE AT THE END OF THIS PHASE I EFFORT WILL PROVIDE THE FOUNDATION FOR NEW TECHNOLOGY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE CHANGE. MOREOVER, THE DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF THE CONSTRAINED PROCESS NETWORK PARADIGM AS AN ENABLER OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE IS A SIGNIFICANT SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTION.",

WEAPONS WITH MUZZLE VELOCITIES OF 2.5 TO 4KN/S (8,000 TO 12,000 FT/S) OR GREATER HAVE POTENTIAL USES IN ALMOST EVERY ASPECT OF WARFARE. RECENT ADVANCES IN PULSED OWER TECHNOLOGY, SPECIFICALLY THE HIGH ENERGY DENSITIES AVAILABLE WITH INTERGRATED PULSE FORMING NETWORKS (IPFNS) AND ADVANCED ROTATING ELECTRICAL MACHINES (AREMS), HAVE OPENED THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP NEW ELECTRICALLY POWERED GUNS FOR TACTICAL APPLICATIONS. THE CURRENT STATE OF THE ART FOR IPFNS IS AN ENERGY DENSITY OF ABOUT 600 J/KG WITH AN INCREASE TO ABOUT 3,000 J/KG EXPECTED BY 1997. CORRESPONDING VALUES FOR AREMS ARE 2,000 J/KG AND 10,000 J/KG. THESE HIGH ENERGY DENSITTIES FOR STORAGE OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY OFFER THE POTENTIAL FOR ELMINATING THE MOBILITY PENALTY PREVISOULY ASSOCIATED WITH TACTICAL APPLICATIONS OF PULSED POWER. KTECH PROPOSES A NOVEL, UNIQUE APPROACH TO TWO-STAGE GUN DESIGN WHICH USES MODERN PULSED POWER TECHNOLOGY TO OVERCOME THE PROBLEMS OF MASS AND SIZE WHICH CURRENTLY PREVENT TWO-STATE GUNS FROM BEING APPLIED ON THE BATTLEFIELD. WE WILL DESIGN A TWO-STAGE HYBRID GUN WHICH WILL COMBINE SEVERAL PROVEN TECHNOLOGIES INTO A SINGLE SYSTEM.

THE HOT, HIGH PRESSURE GAS IN THE TRANSITION SECTION THEN PROPELS THE PROJECTILE DOWN A GUN BARREL IN THE SECOND, GAS GUN STAGE.

WE WILL DEVELOP A NEW SYSTEM OF CARRIERS FOR HANDLING THE GELS INDIVIDUALLY, TANKS AND PUMPS FOR ENSURING CONSTANT TEMPERATURE AND FLUID FLOW, A SYSTEM FOR TRANSPORTING THE CARRIERS BETWEEN TANKS, AND TECHNOLOGY FOR KEEPING THE CONCENTRATION OF THE DYE IN SOLUTION (WHICH IS IN EQUILIBRIUM WITH THE THE COLLOIDAL PARTICLES) CONSTANT.",

Recently discovered storage properties of Fe:LiNbO3 fibers represent advances in this direction, because LiNbO3 has a longer index grating lifetime and a doubled figure of merit over other better known materials. Using the laser-heated pedestal-growth technique, LaserGenics will grow single crystal fibers of iron doped LiTaO3 because it is a material that has been studied extensively and its properties are well known.

Low cost light weight interceptors require optical target tracking sensors and need to achieve accelerations twice as high as those of the ballistic missile. This requires a very high interceptor velocity which in turn results in unacceptable optical sensor window heating and design complexity. Phase I effort will establish feasibility for unique \"RING WING INTERCEPTOR\" (RWI) which is simple, light, uses an optical sensor, obviates the problem of window heating and achieves the required maneuver acceleration. The RWI has a tube shape, uses a side looking sensor window and maneuvers by means of both lateral and axial velocity controls. RWI's high lifting surfaces allow it to achieve twice the maneuver acceleration of a conical reentry vehicle which has twice the velocity. The effort will also identify and prioritize high risk technologies.",

Phase I includes the development of an operational prototype which proves the worth of the system. Phase II will produce a fully operational system that can be used by action officers and decision makers in preparing the POM input. The key feature of the CBRDSS is the ability to generate an optiamal mix of doctrine, training, force structure, leadership, and materiel requirements to meet the challenge of future combat. This is accomplished within the constraints imposed by DoD, the Administration, Congress, and international treaties. The approach links the DTOLMS solutions to the assigned missions, making them more sensitive to the changing threat and less sensitive to parochial interests. The methodology facilitates rapid analysis of trade-off decisions when funding levels of other external influences mandate change. The methodology will establish a set of DTOLMS projects for the resolution of each mission deficiency, and having determined the degree of membership of each project in the solution set for each deficiency will use fuzzy set theory to derive an overall contribution of each project to the total Army mission. Since all Army missions cannot be completely or simultaneously maximized with the available funds, weighted goal programming will be used.",

THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF PHASE I ARE TO CO-OPTIMIZE TWO EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEMS: 10 THE CONDITIONS FOR OPTIMAL IN VITRO STIMULATION OF HUMAN SPLENIC LYMPHOCYTES AND 2) THE SPECIFICS OF THE TRANSFER TO AND RESTIMULATION OF THESE HUMAN LYMPHOCYTES IN SEVERE COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENT (SCID) MICE, SO THAT HIGH AFFINITY IGG ISOTYPE HUMAN MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES CAN BE MORE READILY OBTAINED. SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL 1) OPTIMIZE THE IN VITRO SIMULATION OF HUMAN SPLEEN CELLS FOR TRANSFER TO SCID MICE; 2) OPTIMIZE THE CONDITIONS FOR IN VIVO ANTIGEN RE-STIMULATION OF THESE HUMAN SPLEEN CELLS IN SCID MICE; AND 3) DETERMINE WHETHER ADDITIONAL HUMAN LYMPHOID TISSUE CO-ADMINISTERED TO THE SCID MICE OR THE USE OF DOUBLE MUTANT SCID + BEIGE MICE CAN IMPROVE THE ANTIBODY RESPONSE OF THE GRAFTED HUMAN SPLEEN CELLS. COMMERCIAL APPLICAITONS OF HIGH AFFINITY HUMAN MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES INCLUDE PASSSIVE IMMUNIZATION, TUMOR IMAGING, CANCER IMMUNOTHERAPY AND TREATMENT OF IMMUNODEFICIENCIES AND ALLERGIES. HUMAN MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES WILL ALLEVIATE MUCH OF THE CONCERN OVER INFECTIOUS CONTAMINANTS WHICH ARISES WHEN HUMAN ANTIBODIES ARE PREPARED FROM DONOR BLOOD. THEY WILL ALLOW THE PRODUCTION OF LARGE QUANTITIES OF WELL-DEFINED ANTIBODIES. THEY SHOULD HAVE LONGER HALF LIVES IN PATIENTS THAT MOUSE ANTIBODIES. DESIRED EFFECTOR MECHANISMS SHOULD BE OPTIMALLY STIMULATED BECAUSE OF THE HUMAN ORIGIN AND THE CONTROL OF ISTOYPE WHICH MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES PROVIDE. FINALLY, THEY WILL MINIMIZE THE PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED WHEN ADMINISTERING A FOREIGN ANTIBODY TO HUMANS, ESPECIALLY THE HUMAN ANTI-MOUSE ANTIBODY (HAMA) RESPONSE WHICH HAS RECEIVED MUCH RECENT ATTENTION.",

        "abstract": "THIS PROJECT ADDRESSES THE NATIONAL NEED TO DEVELOP AN EFFECTIVE CONTROL DEVICE FOR CONDENSED ACID MIST EMISSIONS FROM UTILITY POWERPLANTS. SULFURIC ACID MIST EMISSIONS ARE SYMPTOMATIC OF POWER GENERATING PLANTS BURNING HIGH SULFUR COAL AND EQUIPPED WITH WET LIME OR LIMESTONE SCRUBBERS, RESULTING IN A HIGHER PARTICULATE LOAD, CORROSION OF METAL SURFACES, AND THE FORMATION OF A BLUE PLUME LEAVING THE STACK. IN MOST CASES, STACK GAS REHEATING HAS NOT REDUCED THE OPACITY PROBLEM, THEREBY MAKING REMOVAL OF THE MIST THE ONLY ACCEPTABLE SOLUTION. HOWEVER, THE MIST DROPLETS ARE PRIMARILY SUBMICRON IN SIZE AND ARE QUITE DIFFICULT TO REMOVE WITH STANDARD PARTICULATE CONTROL EQUIPMENT. A NOVEL FALLING FILM MIST ELIMINATOR (FFME) IS PROPOSED AS A CONTROL DEVICE FOR THESE EMISSIONS. THE PRINCIPAL ADVANTAGES OF THE FFME ARE ITS LOW PRESSURE DROP, ITS COMPACTNESS, AND ITS ABILITY TO CAPTURE MIST DROPLETS EVEN SMALLER THAN 0.1 MICRONS. THE DEVICE CAN BE EASILY RETROFITTED WITHIN AN EXISTING FUSION GAS DESULFURIZATION (FGD) SCRUBBER GAS DUCT. IN PHASE I, LABORATORY TESTING IS BEING PERFORMED TO VERIFY PROOF-OF-CONCEPT IN REMOVING AN AEROSOL MIST. FFME COLLECTION EFFICIENCY IS BEING DETERMINED WITH STANDARD PENETRATION TEST PROCEDURES, USING A STIMULANT AEROSOL. IN PHASE II, FURTHER TESTING AND REFINEMENT OF THE DESIGN WILL BE COMPLETED, CULMINATING WITH A TEST USING AN ACTUAL MIST AT THE ELECTRIC POWER RESEARCH INSTITUTE MIST ELIMINATOR PILOT FACILITY.",

        "abstract": "This research will develop an innovative and effective technique for the removal of heat from high heat flux electronic components. The cooling fluid is passed through micro-channels engraved in chip substrate which acts as an evaporator in a heat pump loop. The flow in micro-channels is controlled automatically by a TXV to provide subcooled nucleate boiling with no dry out in the channels. This results in a very large heat transfer coefficient and consequently low and isothermal temperature for the electronic components. Fundamental heat transfer measurements for both steady-state and transient two-phase flow in micro-channels will be performed for different combinations of operating pressure, passage size and configuration, fluid flow rate, and fluid properties. The effort will experimentally demonstrate that the proposed pulsed-power electronic cooling system has significant benefits in terms of reduced weight, increased reliability, rapid response, increased heat flux in excess of 2x10(6) W/m(2)),and increased operational flexibility when compared to alternative rapid-transient electronic cooling designs.",

This device would have applications to commercial as well as military needs. The advantage to this system is that the heading or cooling is generated by reaction of water vapor or other working fluid with an adsorbent material, and it does not require the use of refrigeration to keep phase-change material cold. Regeneration could be accomplished with an electric resistance heater that could be inserted into the adsorption bed. In view of Mainstream's long-term commitment to the design and development of long-life, micro-climate cooling systems for military and commercial applications, our past record of sucessful performance, and the potential benefits of a lightweight system, we believe the proposed micro-climate cooling system merits investigation.",

IT USES LOW DIRECTIVITY LOOP-DIPOLE ANTENNAS, GROUND CLUTTER CANCELLATION THROUGH FREQUENCY DIVERSITY AND POSSIBLY LOBE SWITCHING. IT MIGHT ALSO DETECT RADAR CAMOUFLAGE. WE ALSO PROPOSE .01 SCALE MODEL EXPERIMENTS TO SEARCH FOR SUBMERGED OBJECTS FROM THE AIR OVER A TRAY OF SALT SOLUTION. AN APPENDIX WHERE WE DEVELOP THE EQUATIONS NEEDED FOR THE SCALE MODEL ALSO SHOWS THAT THE GROUND CONDUCTIVITY IS CRITICAL IN DETERMINING THE FREQUENCY AT WHICH SUCH A SYSTEM CAN OPERATE. RANGES OF EARTH CONDUCTIVITY FROM THE LITERATURE ARE GIVEN, BUT WE ALSO PROPOSE A SEARCH FOR BETTER DATA AND THE DESIGN OF EXPERIMENTS TO COLLECT SUCH DATA FROM THE AIR IN REGIONS OF MILITARY INTEREST. A NOTABLE FEATURE OF THE PROPOSAL IS ITS EMPHASIS ON THE BASIC LIMITATIONS OF EARTH PENETRATING RADARS. A TWO VOLUME FINAL REPORT IS OFFERED. ONE VOLUME WILL BE DEVOTED TO THESE BASIC LIMITATIONS, TRADEOFFS AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS. IT WILL BE SELF CONTAINED, IN READABLE FORM, INTENDED AS A REFERENCE AND STARTING POINT FOR FURTHER WORK AND MANAGEMENT DECISIONS IN THIS SUBJECT AREA. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS - LOCATING NEAR SURFACE UNDERGROUND FEATURES SUCH AS SPRINGS, RUINS AND OLD STREAMBEDS. ARCHAEOLOGIC FEATURES SUCH AS STONE STRUCTURES ALSO REPRESENT DIFFERENCES IN CONDUCTIVITY AND MIGHT BE LOCATED BY SUCH A DEVICE. IT IS ALSO CONCEIVABLE THAT, WITH PROGRESS IN ELECTRONICS, THE CONCEPT COULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN HAND HELD DEVICES SUCH AS THOSE NOW USED TO FIND LOST COINS, RING AND OTHER CONDUCTING OBJECTS IN SAND BEACHES.",

The objective of the \"concept design\" task will be to define object relationships between equipment and monitored parometer; define requirements for data processing, networking, external transmission and display; and define a knowledge-based system in support of the man-machine interface. The objective of the \"preliminary MRRS system demonstration\" will be to utilize the submitting Company's existing system hardware and relavent application simulations. These simulations depict operational aspects of an MRRS for a SWATH vessel and an expert damage control for an FFQ-7 class vessel. These programs will be merged and modified to present essential MRRS elements for equipment readiness awareness in Readiness Conditions I, III and IV; embedded training and condition-based maintenance. The completion of this proposed Phase I will enhance the implementation of the Phase II prototype by verifying capability of essential technology, by indentifying technical shortfalls before expenditure of larger commitments and by focusing US Navy expectations of an MRRS.",

Fullerenes even have advantages over the ceramic superconductors because of their simple chemistry,isotropic conduction, and potential for infrared sensitivity. The main obstacle to the electronic usefulness of the fullerides is their chemical incompatibility with the ambient atmosphere. MER's outlines an approach in which several methods of producing doped fullerides are evaluated. The techniques investigated include 1) incorporating dopants inside the fullerene cage during creation using MER's production equipment, 2) using alternate, more stable interstitial dopants, and 3) using protective overlayers on alkali doped thin films which will isolate the atmosphere sensitive alkali atoms form the air.",

THE MAJOR LIMITATION TO THE USE OF SILICON CARBIDE IS THE DIFFICULTY IN GROWING LARGE AREA, HIGH QUALITY CRYSTALS. THIS RESEARCH EXAMINES THE EPITAXIAL GROWTH OF SILICON CARBIDE ON SILICON WAFER SUBSTRATES, USING PLASMA-ENHANCED CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION (PECVD). PECVD HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF MUCH LOWER SUBSTRATE TEMPERATURES THAN THERMAL CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION PROCESSES, IN WHICH THE TEMPERATURE IS TYPICALLY 1,350 DEGREES CENTIGRADE FOR SIC GROWTH. EPITAXIAL GROWTH OF SILICON AT TEMPERATURES AS LOW AS 250 DEGREES CENTIGRADE HAS BEEN ACHIEVED WITH PECVD; SIMILAR TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR SIC. SUCH A LOW TEMPERATURE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES THE CRYSTAL DEFECTS DUE TO THERMAL EXPANSION MISMATCH BETWEEN THE SUBSTRATE AND FILM. IN PHASE I, UNDOPED SILICON CARBIDE FILMS ARE BEING GROWN FOR BASIC STRUCTURAL AND ELECTRONIC MEASUREMENTS.",

Also included is information on what qualities are essential if a model is to be useful. Mathtech then describes its approach to developing an LCC model for use in NAVSEA, specifically to study the out-year logistics impacts of various competing equipment designs. Several existing models, from which the new model might be developed, are discussed. Finally, possible sources of input data are discussed, and forms of output data are proposed.",

We propose to design and build small experimental cells that have been appropriately modified to include known amounts of selected nuclides. Baseline and comparison experiments will be performed to test for enhanced nuclear activity in the presence of the selected nuclides.

DEHYDRATION OF BOTH SMALL AND LARGE NATURAL GAS STREAMS WOULD BE ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE BECAUSE OF THE MODULAR NATURE OF MEMBRANE SYSTEMS.

MEMBRANES PREPARED FROM THESE POLYMERS HAVE VERY HIGH SELECTIVITIES FOR WATER VAPOR OVER NATURAL GAS AND ARE COMPATIBLE WITH NATURAL GAS STREAMS AT PRESSURES OF AT LEAST 1,000 PSIG. ONE OF THE MEMBRANES ALSO HAS GOOD SELECTIVITY FOR CARBON DIOXIDE AND HYDROGEN SULFIDE, WHICH ALLOWS (PARTIAL) ACID GAS REMOVAL IN ADDITION TO DEHYDRATION. THE SELECTIVITIES FOR WATER VAPOR ARE SO HIGH THAT THE SEPARATION ACHIEVED IS LIMITED BY THE AVAILABLE PRESSURE RATIO ACROSS THE MEMBRANE AND THE OCCURRENCE OF BOUNDARY LAYERS ON THE FEED-SIDE MEMBRANE SURFACE. THIS MAKES THE PROPER DESIGN AND OPERATION OF THE MEMBRANE SYSTEM CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. THEREFORE, THE PHASE I EFFORT WILL (1) CONSTRUCT SMALL MEMBRANE MODULES THAT FULLY UTILIZE THE EXCELLENT SEPARATION PROPERTIES OF THE MEMBRANES ALREADY DEVELOPED AND (2) VERIFY THE PERFORMANCE OF THE MODULES IN A BENCH-SCALE TEST.

AN INSULATING LAYER OF LIPID OR ORGANOSILANE FORMED OVER THE GATE OF AN ISFET ACTS AS A CAPACITOR.

Holographic windows would replace large and heavy optics currently used in seekers. They will provide the capability of zooming at the target, correcting for shocks and other aero-optics aberrations, and chromatic aberrations. These windows may be combined and dispersed within a radar antenna to form a compact, dual mode seeker. These holographic optical elements could represent the next generation window for both exo- and endatmospheric seekers.",

This situation will greatly complicate the information processing (IP) tasks, especially in the area of the already difficult data association problem. At the same time, all of the traditional tasks remain: fusion of contact reports from different sensors (possibly of different types), compensating for missed detections, etc. This proposal offers to meet these demands by decomposing IP into two stages: a data association stage, which will be accomplished by efficient and computationally inexpensive mathematical programming techniques, and state-estimation stage, which will be accomplished using traditional techniques on the pre-associated data. Experience has shown that this approach can work for the multi-static systems of interest.",

Shearography is somewhat analogous to a large number of strain gages as it permits full-field measurement of strain distribution. It detects flaws in materials by-detecting flaw-induced strain anomolies. Being full-field, non-contacting, and not requiring installing strain gages, the technique appears to have the potential for development into a practical technique for nondestructive evaluation of large objects such as submarine. Despite being a young technique, shearography has already been accepted by the rubber industry for nondestructive evaluation of tires, and by the aerospace industry for nondestructive evaluation composite materials. The proposed investigation aims to prove the feasibility of extending shearography to inspecting rubber to metal bonds. The immediate goal is to accomplish the above objective, and the ultimate is to develop shearography into a fully automated and user-friendly tool for nondestructive evaluation in field/production environments.",

IT IS CAPABLE OF PROVIDING SUBMICRON IMAGE DIMENSIONS IN A TOP LAYER IMAGING PROCESS. THE TONE OF THE PROCESS CAN BE EITHER POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE, DEPENDING ON THE SEQUENCE OF PROCESSING STEPS. THIS PROCESS IS USEFUL FOR IMAGING WITH ULTRAVIOLET, DEEP-UV, X-RAY, ELECTRON-BEAM,AND ION-BEAM RADIATION. IT IS POTENTIALLY USEFUL FOR THE FORMATION OF RESIST IMAGES ON SEMICONDUCTOR AND ELECTRO-OPTICAL SUBSTRATES, AS WELL AS PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD, INNERLAYER, OPTICAL DISC, AND LITHO PLATE PREPARATION. THE GOAL OF THE PHASE I PROGRAM IS TO DEFINE THE MATERIAL AND REACTION CONDITIONS NECESSARY TO OBTAIN THEDESIRED PHOTOREACTION OF THE PHOTOACTIVE MATERIAL AND POLYMER FILM.",

THE POSED SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM IS TO UTILIZE NOVEL GROUND PENETRATING RADAR (GPR) WITH SUITABLE SIGNAL PROCESSING AND TARGET DISCRIMINATION ALGORITHMS.

        "abstract": "1Scientists at Mission Research Corporation (MRC) have developed a concept for a sound projector (Repetitive Energetic Plasma Projector System (REPPS) which may have sonar countermeasure applications. The projector would utilize the well-known technique of an electrical discharge in water to produce a very energetic, broad-band, acoustic pulse. An original hypothesis on how to optimize the electrical to mechanical energy conversion efficiency has been validated by MRC's recent Plasma Driven Water Shock (PDWS) work for the Defense Nuclear Agency (DNA). Recent advances in pulsed power technology have made possible very compact and powertul systems that ten years ago were not feasible. In addition, recent demonstration of Water's capability as a high energy, repetitive, switching fluid further enhances this technique for a system application. We propose to design a complete REPP System, design and test in water a plasma projector element and sonar dome. The objective is to explore the development of a high source level (280 oB), broadband acoustic source.",

THE PROPOSED MODEL WOULD GENERATE REALIZATIONS OF THE RECEIVED SIGNALS AT A SET OF ANTENNAS BY LINEARLY COMBINING INDEPENDENT RANDOM VARIABLE. THE CORRECT LINEAR COMBINATION WOULD BE DETERMINED FROM THE MATRIX OF CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS FOR THE VOLTAGES AT THE SET OF RECEIVING ANTENNAS. FOR STATIONARY CHANNEL CONDITIONS AND FIXED ANTENNA ORENTIATIONS THIS METHOD IS VERY FAST AND REQUIRES ONLY A SMALL ARRAY SPACE. FOR NON-STATIONARY CONDITIONS THE LINEAR COEFFICIENTS CAN BE PERIODICALLY UPDATED THEREBY ALLOWING THE SIGNAL REALIZATION TO EVOLVE IN A QUASI-STATIONARY MANNER. THIS MODEL IS KNOWN TO BE FEASIBLE UNDER RESTRICTED CHANNEL CONDITIONS (THE TURBULENT MODEL). WE WOULD EVALUATE WHETHER THE MODEL CAN BE EXTENDED TO ENCOMPASS THE DNA GENERAL CHANNEL IMPUSLE RESPONSE MODEL THAT IS CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED IN ACIRF/RCIRF. THE ADVANTAGES OF THE PROPOSED CHANNEL MODEL, RELATIVE TO CURRENT MODELS, ARE: 1) SIGNAL REALIZATIONS PROVIDED DIRECTLY TO A COMMUNICATIONS/RADAR SIMULATION BY MEANS OF A SUBROUTINE CALL; 2) CHANNEL CONDITIONS AND ANTENNA ORIENTATION COULD CHANGE CONTINOUSLY WITH TIME; 3) SMALLER RAM, DISK STRAGE AND CPU REQUIREMENTS THAN CURRENT METHODS.",

THE TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL EVOLUTION OF THIS PATTERN CAN BE TRACKED INDEFINITELY WITH A SECOND, VISIBLE WAVELENGTH \"INTERROGATION\" LASER BY RECORDING THE TIME-EVOLVING IMAGE SEQUENCE WITH A VIDEO CAMERA. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS/POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS - THE PHANTOMM FLOW TAGGING METHOD OFFERS UNIQUE CAPABILITY FOR OBTAINING QUANTITATIVE VELOCITY DATA IN INCOMPRESSIBLE FLOW FIELDS. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT A VERY SIGNIFICANT GROUP OF RESEARCHERS, BOTH FEDERALLY-SPONSORED AND GOVERNMENT LABS, IN A VARIETY OF FLUID MECHANIC DISCIPLINES WILL BENEFIT FROM THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUITABLE PROBES. THE CONUNERCIAL POTENTIAL FOR THE LARGE-SCALE MANUFACTURING OF THESE PROBES IS SIGNIFICANT.",

The components of the battery system are processable materials that can be used in the fabrication of an all solid state thin film polymer electrolyte batteries of any shape, size and capacity. Prototype 2.0 mAh capacity cells in the thin film flat planar configuration showed about 80% cathode utilization at C/10 rate, excellent recharability with more than 800 cycles at 3 different C-rates and long shelf life. Based on our preliminary cell data, we propose to optimize the cell components in the design of a scaleup prototype and evaluate the electrochemical performance. Thin film rechargeable batteries of various capacity will be fabricated to determine the energy and power densities, cycle life, rate capability, charge retention capability, cycling performance and overcharge and overdischarge phenomen. Finally an attempt will be made to assess the use of the proposed Lithium/polymer electrolyte/PRC redox battery systems to power military communication equipment, portable computers and other electronic devices.",

Existing Cost Estimating (CE) methodologies are unsatisfactory, primarily due to their dependency upon data that is impossible or impractical to get, especially during the acquisition phase and particularly pertinent to O&S costs. This effort provides a review of the many CE methodologies, initiatives to improve shortcomings, and research into their efficacy. A prime result will be the identification of the critical causal relationships of LCC drivers, minimal essential data, and potential sources of that data. Concentrating on those critical elements, favorable CE methodologies will be augmented with a CE expert system to provide a CE assistant usable for ship design trade-offs in early program phases. Augmentation includes the structure of a corporate data base of program LCC experience across programs, use of operational simulators to expand the experience base with synthetic data from \"what-if\" scenarios, and navigation and parameter generation help to interface to specialty engineering models throughout DoD and industrial organizations. Approaches to acquire and preprocess actual O&S data will also be identified.",

ADVANTAGES OF ON-LINE CONSOLIDATION THROUGH FIBER PLACEMENT ARE CONTINUOUS WINDING OF THICK-WALLED PARTS, ELIMINATION OF OVEN OR AUTOCLAVING CURING, LOW VOID CONTENT, AND LESS MATERIAL SCRAP. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES TO WIDESPREAD USE OF FIBER PLACEMENT IS THE REDUCTION OF PRODUCTION COSTS TO BE COMPETITIVE WITH THAT OF EPOXY SYSTEMS. A KEY TO REDUCING MANUFACTURE COSTS IS THE INCREASE OF FABRICATION SPEEDS WHILE MAINTAINING PROCESS QUALITY. A ROBUST CONTROL SYSTEM FOR RAPID CONSOLIDATION OF COMPOSITE MATERIAL REQUIRES THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN ACCURATE FEEDBACK INFORMATION FROM THE PROCESS AND THE ABILITY TO ADAPT TO UNFORESEEN CHANGES IN THE PROCESS DYNAMICS. NEURODYNE WILL APPLY INTERNALLY DEVELOPED INNOVATIONS IN NEURAL NETWORK BASED LEARNING OPTIMAL CONTROL TO LEARN AND OPTIMIZE FIBER PLACEMENT PROCESS DYNAMICS ON-LINE.

The classification portion of the algorithm allows one to separate, classify, and identify targets when the received signal is the sum of a few nonlinearly generated components in additive noise. It is therefore particularly relevant to realistic scenarios, unlike other proposed algorithms that cannot handle signals with multiple nonlinear components and/or additive noise. The tracking portion of the algorithm allows one to detect and follow a maneuvering target that is emitting either a nonlinearly generated signal, or a near-linear narrow-band continuous wave (CW), even when the signal is too faint to be seen in a single, typically short, time window.",

SPIS WOULD BE VALUABLE IN RESEARCH ON THE MECHANIXM OF SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION, AND MAY WELL FORM THE BASIS OF NOVEL TARGETED PROPHYLACTIC AND THERAPEUTIC AGENTS FOR PHYSIOLOGICAL DISORDERS ASSOCIATED WITH ABERRANT SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION ESPECIALLY SOME TYPES OF CANCERS. THE PHASE I OBJECTIVE IS TO ESTABLISH IF SPIS FUNCTION AS SUBSTRATE OR INHIBITOR IN HYDROLOSIS CATALYZED BY PI-PLC. FOR THIS, PROTOTYPICAL SPI ANALOGUES WILL BE PREPARED BY SYNTHESIS AND THEIR BEHAVIOR IN HYDROLYSIS CATALYZED BY A BACTERIAL PI-PLC STUDIED IN COMPARISON WITH PRODUCT PROFILE OF PI-PLC HYDROLYSIS OF PI.

Its acceptance is limited, however, because processing beryllium presents a serious health hazard to workers. In particular, machining beryllium creates toxic dust which can cause berylliosis, a chronic lung disease. This effort will explore whether alloys of beryllium made by Hot Isostatic Pressing can be machined without generating respirable beryllium particles. Four alloying elements have been selected for Phase I: aluminum, magnesium, copper and titanium. Three to four compositions of each alloy will be manufactured under conditions likely to produce finely mixed and homogeneous materials. Calibrated air samples will be taken while each alloy is test machined to determine the quantity of respirable dust produced. Alloys which produce little or no respirable dust and are within 15% of the density of beryllium will be candidates for further study as lower cost materials for beryllium applications.",

This system, albeit very reliable and saft since the implementation of SUBSAFE requirements, requires a multitude of potentially noisy high pressure air compressors, dessicant stacks, and connecting piping, etc., and once used, necessitates spending many hours at or near the surface for recharging. In addition, due to the high hydrostatic pressure they are capable of removing less than 20% of the water in the ballast tanks at or near the submarines maximum operating depth. For Phase I OSR plans to submit a design for a compact, fast acting gas generator that can produce several times as much gas as a comparably sized high pressure air flask. It will be totally self-contained requiring virtually no maintenance, and will be designed for easy regeneration at sea from on-board resources.

THE UNIQUE FEATURE OF THE PROPOSED STABILIZATION TECHNIQUE IS THE USE OF INTERFEROMETRIC PHASE DETECTION OF THE ZERO-CROSSING POINT OF THE ANOMALOUS DISPERSION CURVE AT THEPOSITION OF LINE CENTER. PHASE DETECTION HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING INSENSITIVE TO INTENSITY FLUCTUATIONS AND TO DYNAMIC IMBALANCES BETWEEN THE INTERFERING BEAMS.

The Phase I will demonstrate: 1) flip-chip solder bump-bonding of MOSIS-fabricated VLSI circuitry onto CTPs; 2) assembly of a complete device consisting of a VLSI/CTP/LC sandwich; and 3) testing and characterization of these electrically-addressed devices. The advantages of this approach over the current  non-CTP technology include: 1) higher contrast ratios, since the CTP is optically flat and a second liquid-crystal alignment layer can be deposited on it; 2) larger and more densely-packed arrays offering significantly increased parallelism at lower cost; 3) excellent spatial uniformity and the elimination of unwanted fixed pattern noise since the CTP provides an optically flat and smooth dielectric mirror surface for the liquid crystal cell; and 4) high optical readout efficiency because of the use of a highly reflective dielectric mirror surface on the CTP, and because the LC modulating element is optically isolated from the underlying driving circuitry. Commercial applications include parallel bistable optical memories, reconfigurable optical interconnects, visual displays, or, using more complex VLSI circuitry, \"smart pixel\" image processors or neural network circuit element.",

Current problem solutions use relatively simple metrics to characterize changes in recorded data. The approaches are model-based and of limited utility. In many cases, the interaction of fault conditions with the mechanical system is time-varying and highly nonlinear. Specifying a good analytic model is at best difficult and most likely impossible. An alternative solution is to use neural nets coupled with appropriate feature extractors. Neural nets have been used extensively and successfully at ORINCON to solve detection and classification problems in underwater acoustics. Neural networks assume no underlying model for the events of interest. Rather, the neural netork \"learns\" to detect and classify faults by examination of features from training data which have known fault conditions. In Phase I, ORINCON will develop a prototype system that uses three feature extractors coupled with a multilayer perceptron neural net to solve the problem. The three features selected are well suited for characterization of the expected fault classes. We will demonstrate the prototype system processing real data supplied by Westland Helicopters.",

The second issue will address multiple receive platforms, with consort data fusion processing occurring on a single receive platform. ORINCON proposes to modify the MSS Information Processor (IP) to examine the performance and effectiveness of single hypothesis trackers (SHT) versus multiple hypothesis trackers (MHT) in the bistatic and multistatic operating environment. For the third issue, ORINCON will identify a method of recognizing and removing range-ambiguous contacts in the tracker, thereby reducing one false alarm contributor.

        "abstract": "THE TREATMENT OF MAJOR TENDON AND LIGAMENT INJURIES IS A SIGNIFICANT THERAPEUTIC PROBLEM. IN MANY CASES, REPAIR OR RECONSTRUCTION OF THE INJURED STRUCTURE IS NECESSARY TO REDUCE INSTABILITY. THESE REPAIRS MAY ALSO SERVE TO SLOW THE PROGRESS OF ASSOCIATED DEGENERATIVE JOINT DISEASE (ARTHRITIS). ALTHOUGH TENDON AND LIGAMENT RECONSTRUCTION USING GRAFTS OF THE PATIENT'S OWN TISSUE (AUTOGRAFTS) HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL, THEY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL SURGERY FOR GRAFT PREPARATION. THIS ALONE MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS AT THE HARVEST SITE. THESE GRAFTS MAY ALSO UNDERGO ELONGATION OR MECHANICAL FAILURE. TENDON AND LIGAMENT GRAFTS OBTAINED FROM HUMAN CADAVERIC DONORS (ALLOGRAFTS) CAN PRODUCE AN IMMUNE RESPONSE AND FEAR OF VIRAL CONTAMINATION HAVE FURTHER CURTAILED THEIR USE. IN SPITE OF THESE CONCERNS, DEMAND FOR ALLOGRAFT LIGAMENT SUBSTITUTES FAR EXCEEDS THE SUPPLY OF AVAILABLE TISSUE; THUS AN ALTERNATIVE IS CLEARLY NEEDED. SYNTHETIC GRAFTS AVOID THE ADDITIONAL SURGERY OF GRAFT HARVEST. HOWEVER, SYNTHETIC MATERIALS PRESENT A HOST OF PROBLEMS INCLUDING ATTACHMENT, WEAR AND WEAR DEBRIS AND LACK OF MECHANICAL AND BIOLOGICAL COMPATIBILITY. GRAFT MATERIALS FROM ANIMALS (XENOGRAFTS) ARE READILY AVAILABLE. THE OBVIOUS DISADVANTAGE OF THIS MATERIAL IS ITS SIGNIFICANT REJECTION (IMMUNE) RESPONSE. EXTRACTION PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO REMOVE THE ANTIGENIC COMPONENTS OF BOVINE TENDON XENOGRAFTS AND GREATLY REDUCE THE TENDENCY FOR REJECTION. IN RABBITS, THE MECHANICAL STRENGTH, BIOCOMPATIBILITY AND HUMORAL IMMUNE RESPONSE TO PROCESSED BOVINE XENOGRAFTS HAS UNDERGONE TESTING. ALTHOUGH THE INITIAL RESULTS HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY PROMISING, BEFORE HUMAN USE CAN BE CONSIDERED THESE XENOGRAF PROCEDURES MUST BE OPTIMIZED AND MORE EXTENSIVELY TESTED. IF THE EXPERIMENTS ARE SUCCESSFUL THE EXTRACTION PROCEDURES DEVELOPED FOR XENOGRAFTS MAY PERMIT THE USE OF THESE MATERIALS IN HUMAN LIGAMENT SURGERY.",

PHASE I OF THIS PROJECT ADDRESSES SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE AND DESIGN OBJECTIVES FOR CASTING OF METALLIC FUEL IN THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE FUEL CYCLE FACILITY (FCF) AT ARGONNE NATIONAL LABORATORY-WEST. FEASIBILITY OF PERFORMANCE IS DEMONSTRATED IN PIN CASTING EXPERIMENTS USING A HIGH MELTING SAMPLE MATERIAL. SPECIFIC ATTENTION IS BEING GIVEN TO ACHIEVING CASTING CONDITIONS THAT PROMOTE HIGH CASTING RATES WITH A FINE CRYSTAL STRUCTURE IN THE SOLIDIFIED MATERIAL. DESIGN FEASIBILITY WILL BE DEMONSTRATED BY CREATING A CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF A FULL SCALE, CONTINUOUS CASTING MACHINE THAT EMPLOYS REMOTE OPERATING PROCEDURES AND IS COMPATIBLE WITH FCF HARDWARE AND PROCEDURES. THIS CONCEPTUAL DESIGN WILL PROVIDE THE STARTING POINT FOR PHASE II DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF THE FULL SCALE CASTING MACHINE.",

A COAL-BASED MIXTURE CONSISTS OF FINE PARTICLES OF COAL SUSPENDED IN A LIQUID TO FORM A SLURRY THAT IS EASILY TRANSPORTED, STORED, AND BURNED. HOWEVER, THE USE OF COAL-BASED MIXTURES IS CURRENTLY LIMITED BY DIFFICULTIES IN PRODUCING A FINE SPRAY OF COAL SLURRY FOR EFFICIENT COMBUSTION. THIS PROJECT IS DEVELOPING AN EFFICIENT ATOMIZER FOR THE COMBUSTION OF COAL SLURRIES. THE ATOMIZER WOULD PRODUCE A VERY FINE SPRAY OF COAL SLURRY FOR EFFICIENT COMBUSTION AND WOULD USE ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF THE AIRFLOW REQUIRED BY CONVENTIONAL ATOMIZERS. THE SLURRY ATOMIZER MAKES IT MORE ATTRACTIVE TO USE COAL SLURRIES BY IMPROVING EFFICIENCY, SIMPLIFYING COMBUSTOR DESIGN, AND DRASTICALLY REDUCING THE SIZE OF THE AIR COMPRESSION EQUIPMENT NEEDED TO ATOMIZE THE SLURRY. THE PHASE I STUDIES ARE ATTEMPTING TO PROVE THE FEASIBILITY OF THE ATOMIZER THROUGH LABORATORY DEMONSTRATIONS AND ANALYSIS OF THE THREE-PHASE FLOW IN THE ATOMIZER AND SPRAY.

These features will allow effective cooling of high heat dissipation and temperature sensitive devices in high density electronic packaging applications. In Phase I we will quantify through analysis the potential gains in performance and evaluate the feasibility and cost of fabricating the device.

Data are presented that show the ability of supercritical fluids to extract materials from mixtures and to act as anti-solvents for recrystallizing solids. Previous studies with RDX and NQ are discussed in which the material is dissolved in an organic liquid and then precipitated from solution using a gas or super-critical fluid. A combination of organic solvents and a supercritical fluid, specifically carbon dioxide, will be used to achieve both removal of the desired ingredients from the formulation and production of new forms of the energetic materials.

THE APPROACH RELIES ON THE DETECTION OF SMALL REFRACTIVE INDEX CHANGES IN A THIN SURFACE FILM. SPECIFICITY FOR CHLORINE DIOXIDE IS ACHIEVED BY USING A SURFACE FILM THAT IS REACTIVE OR INTERACTIVE WITH CHLORINE DIOXIDE. A MIXING SENSOR BASED ON THIS APPROACH HAS SEVERAL KEY ADVANTAGES: (1) IT ALLOWS REAL-TIME, CONTINUOUS, IN-SITU MONITORING; (2) IT HAS A BROAD DYNAMIC RANGE, YET IS CAPABLE OF SENSITIVITIES DOWN TO THE PPB LEVEL; (3) IT CAN BE FULLY REVERSIBLE; AND (4) IT PERMITS SPATIAL RESOLUTION WELL BELOW 1 MILLIMETER. THE RESULTING PRODUCT WILL BE SUITABLE FOR ASSESSING BOTH MACROSCOPIC AND MICROSCOPIC MIXING, AND IT WILL PERMIT AUTOMATED FEEDBACK CONTROL OF PULP MIXERS. MOREOVER, DEVELOPMENT OF SENSORS FOR OTHER BLEACHING CHEMICALS (E.G., OZONE, HYDROGEN PEROXIDE) WOULD BE A DIRECT EXTENSION OF THIS EFFORT.

The proposed crossbar can realize N x N switchings with only 2N switches, and is reconfigurable to any switching pattern, including two-way non-blocking switching and active wavelength division multiplexing and demultiplexing.

In the interconnection hierarchy, backplane interconnnections impose the most serious speed limitations on 3-D optoelectronic computing systems. Physical Optics Corp proposes an Active Optical Backplane (AOB) which will upgrade the architecture of 3-D optoelectronic computing systems and produce much higher modulation speeds (to 1000 Gbit/sec) among processing elements. When compared with existing electronic backplanes (EB) and Passive Optical Backplanes, the AOB has the same advantage of system compatibility as EBs while keeping the modulation speed projected for POBs. Unlike POBs, the proposed AOB performs both modulation and demodulation on the backplane itself. As a result, the electronic packaging issue is automatically solved without modifying existing connectors from card boards to the backplane. Among all backplane buses investigated, Futurebus+ has the widest data bit width (up to 128 bits), and highest user acceptability. Futurebus+ will be incorporated into this program. Phase I will demonstrate a AOB with on-board modulation and demodulation, with physical layers and protocol in Phase II.",

WE PROPOSE A FIBER OPTIC SENSOR THAT CAN MEASURE BOTH OXYGEN CONCENTRATION AND FLOW RATE SAFELY AND RELIABLY. THE PROPOSED OXYGEN CONCENTRATION SENSOR UTILIZES POROUS OPTICAL FIBERS AND GAS SPECIFIC INDICATOR DYES. THE PROPOSED FLOW RATE SENSOR USES A LENGTH OF COMMERICALLY AVAILABLE FIBER HELD TAU GHT ACROSS THE GAS FLOW. VIBRATIONS INDUCED IN THE OPTICAL FIBER, WHICH ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE FLOW RATE, ARE MONITORED OPTICALLY VIA A CHANGE IN SPECKLE PATTERN, OR INTERFEROMETRICALLY. A PHASE II PROTOTYPE WOULD INVOLVE COMBINING BOTH OF THESE SENSING TECHNIQUES INTO A SINGLE OPTICAL FIBER SENSOR.",

        "abstract": "Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes a traveling wave plasmon/polymer waveguide modulator. Conventional EO modulators suffer from small modulation bandwidths (usually much less than 100 GHz) due to the large walk-off between the propagation of the microwaves and optical waves. Additionally, the small index modulation associated with linear electrooptic coefficients requires a long electrode length (mm to cm). The proposed plasmon waveguide modulator, in conjunction with an EO polymer, provides a modulation scheme that has a small interaction length (about 100 um). No dispersion between the optical waves and the microwaves is expected. Employment of a collinear microstrip line generates a much better overlap integral between the optical and microwave signals, and power consumption is reduced in comparison with conventional coplanar electrode structures used for LiNbO3 and GaAs EO modulators. The optical bandwidth is greatly enhanced by adjusting the input coupling angle and the bouncing angle of the substrate-guided wave, which has a continuous guiding spectrum as long as the total internal reflection (TIR) criterion is satisfied. A plasmon waveguide modulator will be demonstrated in Phase I. The microstrip line suitable for transmitting a 100 GHz signal will also be tested.",

The proposed correlator eliminates the spatial light modulator (SLM) from the Fourier plan of an optical correlator by using neural network models to train a set of filters and multiplex them onto a volume holographic plate, to simultaneously correlate the input object with multiple filters. The system can be compactly packaged in a rugged and light box suitable for airborne operations. In Phase I, such pattern recognition algorithms as synthetic discriminant functions (SDF's), circular harmonic filters (CHFs) and moving target indication (MTI) techniques will be examined. A proper combination of the filters for shift-scale-rotation and projection invariant target recognition will be selected for neural network training and feature extraction. Neural network models such as the Inter-Pattern Association (IPA) and backpropagation models will be studied for use in the construction of the associative filters. Experimental results of the proposed correlator will be demonstrated. Software and hardware engineering design of a prototype FPHAF based compact optical filter will be provided for Phase II implementation of the system.",

The novel technique shall make use of multiwavelength analysis of light scattering properties of the particles to infer the particle index of refraction, the soot number density and the particle size distribution. The Phase I technical objectives are the following: a) Investigate the feasibility of using multiwavelength light scattering and extinction properties of sooting flows from which the size distribution of soot can be inferred; b) Determine the particle dynamic range of the proposed instrument, sensitivity, and limitations as applied to the specific application; c) Investigate the relative merits of using a single laser, i.e., an Argon-ion, as opposed to three different lines with widely spaced wavelengths; d) Develop a breadboard system from which preliminary measurements of soot can be measured from a laboratory scale flame. The effort shall consist of using three different wavelengths of laser light to obtain the light scattering and extinction from soot particles to infer the complex index of refraction of soot, its concentration, and the particle size distribution. The use of solid state diode lasers and photodiodes shall be incorporated in the novel instrument to obtain a compact probe to be used in typical combustion environments.",

Preliminary experiments on electrooptic materials have demonstrated such conversion/modulation. The A/D converter/modulator consists of an integrated optic channel waveguide with device end faces polished and coated with high reflectivity mirrors. The resultant transmission response of the device can be tuned through the electrooptic effect. Several advantages of the A/D converter/modulator are its multi-valued logical capability, electronically reconfigurable logical weights, and high speed operation (~GHz). Additional advantages include elimination of the use of sampling optical pulse, provision of long distance digital optical signal tranmission capability, high SNR, high dynamic range and thermal stability. The reconfigurable multiwavelength coding can be used to realize highly secure optical communication for military an commerical purposes.",

        "abstract": "Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes a novel approach to directed energy systems based on high efficiency holographic generation of diffraction-free beams. Diffraction-free beams are not subject to transverse spreading (diffraction), in sharp contrast with the currently used Gaussian-profile directed energy beams which undergo significant spreading along the propagation direction. POC's approach is to first generate the diffraction-free beam with the conventional slit-lens method, and then record the interference pattern of the diffraction-free beam and a Gaussian beam as a volume phase hologram using POC's proprietary volume holographic technology. When such a volume hologram is illuminated by a Gaussian beanm from a directed energy laser, it converts most of the incident light into a diffraction-free beam. Using POC's volume holographic technology, the conversion efficiency can potentially reach 99%, significantly better than existing methods. If the proposed research is successful, the practical use of diffraction-free beams can become possible. Such beams provide energy transport efficiency several orders of magnitude higher than Gaussian beams, and can give rise to a new generation of directed energy systems featuring ultrahigh energy transport efficiency, low energy budget, lower cost beam control equipment, and real-time capability.",

A MAJOR OBSTACLE TO THIS APPLICATION IS THE PRESENCE OF COAL-DERIVED CONTAMINANTS IN THE GASEOUS FUEL STREAM. THESE CONTAMINANTS PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN MCFC PERFORMANCE AND LIFE UNLESS THEY ARE GREATLY REDUCED IN CONCENTRATION. THIS PROJECT ADDRESSES A SIMPLE AND INEXPENSIVE MEANS FOR CONTROLLING FUEL CELL DETERIORATION DUE TO CHLORIDE CONTAMINANTS IN THE FUEL. CHLORIDE DISSOLVES READILY IN THE MOLTEN LITHIUM-POTASSIUM CARBONATE ELECTROLYTE USED IN MCFCS. THIS DISSOLVED CHLORIDE GREATLY INCREASES THE RATE OF ELECTROLYTE VAPOR LOSS AND COMPOSITION CHANGE. THIS APPROACH FOR SOLVING THIS PROBLEM CONSISTS OF USING ALKALI-CONTAINING ADDITIVES IN THE ANODE GAS STREAM TO OFFSET THE VAPOR LOSSES AND STABILIZE THE ELECTROLYTE COMPOSITION. IN PHASE I, A REALISTIC MODEL OF CHLORIDE-INDUCED MCFC PERFORMANCE DECAY WILL BE EXTENDED AND APPLIED. RESULTS OF THESE CALCULATIONS WILL BE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE THE MOST EFFECTIVE ADDITIVES AND OPERATING STRATEGIES.

While spacecraft and various expendable devices have improved our ability to gather such data, both have drawbacks. This SBIR proposes to examine the feasibility of exploiting newly developed neutrally buoyant technology to overcome some of the short comings of spacecraft and conventional expendable oceanographic devices in order bo improve the Navy's ability to collect tactically relevant data. PRB Associates and Webb Research are presently involved in a Phase II SBIH that provides some of the desired capabilities. This SBIR would extend that work and focus on developing an air-deployable instrument ^alled Expendable Autonomous Profiler (XAP) for routine tactical use. Such a device could be fitted with a variety of sensors for both defense and non defense applications.",

MOST ARE SLOW PROCESSES AND REQUIRE RESIDENCE TIMES MEASURED IN MINUTES. THE FLUIDIZED IMPACT MILL USES THE KINETIC ENERGY DERIVED FROM THROWING FEED MATERIALS AGAINST STATIONARY ANVILS AT HIGH SPEED TO BREAK THE FEEDSTOCK DOWN INTO FINE PARTICULATES. A ROTARY ASSEMBLY ACTS AS A PUMP TO RAPIDLY ACCELERATE THE SPEED OF ENTERING FEED MATERIALS TO A HIGH IMPACT SPEED. THE ASSEMBLY IS CONSTRUCTED OF SEVERAL PARALLEL DISKS, SPACED AT DISTANCES THAT ARE GREATER THAN THE SIZE OF THE LARGEST FEED. EACH DISK HAS THREE RADIAL FLIGHTS RADIATING FROM ITS CENTER HOLE TO ITS OUTER EDGE. THE FEED ENTERS THROUGH THE HOLLOW SHAFT OF THE ROTATING ASSEMBLY AND PASSES DOWN THE CENTRAL CHAMBER FORMED BY THE HOLES IN THE PARALLEL DISKS. CENTRIFUGAL FORCES DRAW THE FEED RADIALLY OUTWARD, THROUGH A WINDOW IN THE SURROUNDING HOUSING. THE PUMPING ACTION OF THIS ROTARY ASSEMBLY, OR IMPELLER, DRAWS AIR IN TO FLUIDIZE THE SOLID FEED MATERIALS IN AN AIR STREAM, SUBSTANTIALLY DECREASING FRICTIONAL LOSSES AND WEAR RATES. THE ACCELERATED FEED BREAKS AGAINST THE STATIONARY ANVILS AND, STILL ENTRAINED IN THE AIR STREAM, ENTERS AN ADJACENT AIR SORTING CHAMBER. THERE, OVERSIZE PARTICULATES DROP OUT (BY GRAVITY) TO RETURN TO THE ORIGINAL HOLLOW SHAFT ENTRY WITH NEW FEED. THE RECYCLING PROCESS CONTINUES UNTIL THE FEED IS SMALL ENOUGH TO EXIT THE SYSTEM IN THE AIR STREAM. THIS LOW ENERGY METHOD USES ONLY A FEW KILOWATT-HOURS/TON OF FEED FOR MOST FEEDSTOCKS. IT ALSO REQUIRES RESIDENCE TIMES OF ONLY A FEW SECONDS FOR LARGE CHANGES IN SIZE AND HAS LOW WEAR RATES. PHASE I CONSISTS OF BUILDING AND TESTING A PILOT UNIT.

This formal, rigorous language allows a dynamic integration strategy to be tailored to the specific needs of each modification. Unlike proposed alternatives, our technique works with existing languages, architectures and SW designs.

IN CURRENT METHODOLOGY, THERE IS NO SINGLE STEP PROCESS FOR GENERATING SPECIFIC DNA FRAGMENTS IN THE MEGABASE SIZE RANGE. PROMEGA WILL UNDERTAKE RANDOM MUTAGENESIS COUPLED WITH A POWERFUL, NOVEL GENETIC SELECTION TO ISOLATE FORMS OF AN INTRON-ENCODED SITE-SPECIFIC ENDONUCLEASE--I-PPO--WITH POTENTIAL FOR USE IN GENOME ANALYSIS. THESE GOAL OF THESE STUDIES WOULD BE TO DEVELOP 1) A FAMILY OF ENZYMES WITH A RANGE OF CUTTING FREQUENCIES IN THE 2-1--M EGABASE SIZE RANGE, 2) ADVANCED METHODS FOR ANALYZING NOVEL DNA-PROTEIN INTERACTION, AND 3) ADVANCED GENETIC SELECTION METHODOLOGY USEFUL FOR DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE DETERMINANTS FOR RECOGNITION AND CATALYSIS BY OTHER SITE-SPECIFIC ENDONUCLEASES. TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF ACHIEVING THESE RESULTS, PHASE I RESEARCH WILL FOCUS ON TWO SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) SYSTEMATICALLY EXAMINE THE TOLERATION FOR BASE SUBSTITUTIONS WITHIN THE CANONICAL 15 BASE PAIR I-PPO RECOGNITION SEQUENCE. 2) DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF A GENETIC SELECTION FOR MUTANT ENZYMES WITH ALTERED SPECIFICITY. SUBSEQUENT TO PHASE I AND PHASE II STUDIES, PROMEGA WOULD COMMERCIALIZE THE RARE-CUTTING ENZYMES, AND SEEK STRATEGIC ALLIANCES TO INCORPORATE THE ENZYMES INTO AUTOMATED DNA MAPPING AND ANLYSIS APPLICATIONS.",

THIS COMBINATION, AVAILABLE WITH A STATE-OF-THE-ART PROCESS, ALLOWS Q-DOT TO EXPLOIT THE ADVANTAGES OF BOTH DEVICES. RTD'S HAVE BEEN OPERATED TO 2.5 THZ, BUT THEIR PRACTICAL USE IS LIMITED BY THEIR TWO-TERMINAL NATURE (NO ISOLATION AND LOW DRIVE CAPABILITY). INP HBT'S PROVIDE THE ISOLATION AND DRIVE REQUIRED TO EFFECTIVELY COMBINE FUNCTIONAL BLOCKS, BUT CARE MUST BE TAKEN TO AVOID LIMITING THE RTD'S QUANTUM SWITCHING SPEED.

Nuclear magnetism provides a unique signature for common military explosives, a signature which is detectable in the presence of time-varying fields. In Phase I we propose to demonstrate the feasibility of an explosives detection and identification method based upon nuclear magnetism. This method is readily adaptable to the single-sided geometry required for mine detection. Preliminary calculations indicate that a nuclear magnetism detection system of modest size and weight will be able to detect less than one half pound of trinitrotoluene (TNT) at a distance of one foot with low (less than 1%) false-alarm and false-safe rates.",

THESE INSTRUMENTS MUST BE PROTECTED FROM THE HIGH FLUXES OF NEUTRONS AND GAMMA RAYS FROM THE PLASMAS. X-RAY DETECTORS CAN BE DAMAGED OR DESTROYED BY THE RADIATION ENVIRONMENT ASSOCIATED WITH FUSION EXPERIMENTS. EXISTING X-RAY SPECTROMETERS SEEM ILL-SUITED TO THE RADIATION ENVIRONMENT OF DEUTERIUM-TRITIUM OPERATIONS OF FUTURE FUSION REACTORS AT THE TOKAMAK FUSION TEST REACTOR BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN NO EFFECTIVE WAY TO PREVENT UNWANTED RADIATION FROM ENTERING THROUGH THE APERTURE OF THE INSTRUMENT. REFLECTION OF HARD X-RAYS FROM MULTILAYER COATINGS HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED, BUT MULTILAYER-COATED GRAZING INCIDENCE REFLECTORS WERE NOT PRACTICAL FOR X-RAY BEAM DEFLECTION BECAUSE THE HIGH REFLECTANCE BANDWIDTH OF SINGLE-PERIOD MULTILAYER COATINGS IS TOO NARROW FOR THIS APPLICATION. GRADED-PERIOD MULTILAYER REFLECTORS OFFER SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED BANDWIDTH. THIS FACILITATES THE DESIGN OF AN ENERGY-DISPERSIVE HARD X-RAY SPECTROMETER WHOSE DETECTORS ARE SHIELDED FROM DIRECT RADIATION FROM THE PLASMA. PHASE I INVESTIGATES THE FEASIBILITY OF USING A GRADED-PERIOD MULTILAYER MIRROR TO DEFLECT THE ENTERING BEAM OF A SHIELDED HARD X-RAY SPECTROMETER. AN OPTIMAL MULTILAYER COATING DESIGN IS BEING GENERATED, AND ITS THROUGHPUT IS BEING CALCULATED FOR REPRESENTATIVE TOKAMAK SPECTRA IN THE 20 KEV RANGE. A GRADED MULTILAYER WILL BE PROCURED AND ITS HARD X-RAY REFLECTION CHARACTERISTICS EVALUATED. THIS PROJECT WILL DEMONSTRATE THE VALUE OF USING GRADED-PERIOD MULTILAYER DIFFRACTORS AS GRAZING INCIDENCE HARD X-RAY REFLECTORS. A VALUABLE DIAGNOSTIC TOOL THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN LOST WILL BE PRESERVED. GRADED-PERIOD MULTILAYER REFLECTORS WILL ALSO BE IMMEDIATELY USEFUL AS REFLECTORS IN SYNCHROTRON RADIATION BEAM LINES AND IN HARD X-RAY ASTRONOMICAL TELESCOPES.",

The objective of this project is to evaluate the feasibility of using graded period multilayer coatings to build a broad band hard X-ray concentrator. An optimal multilayer coating design will be generated. A graded multilayer will be procured and its hard X-ray reflection characteristics will be evaluated. Because most hard X-ray sources produce continuous spectra, a broad band hard X-ray reflector can produce a net gain in X-ray energy per unit area. Thus, broad band reflectors should be useful as hard X-ray concentrators in synchrotron radiation instrumentation, medical technology, and perhaps, NDE and security instrumentation.",

THE TECHNIQUE EMPLOYS THIN CELLULOSE MEMBRANES AS THE SUPPORTS FOR THE SEPARATION OF SEQUENCING FRAGMENTS IN AN ELECTRIC FIELD. NUCLEIC ACID (DNA, RNA) FRAGMENTS ARE DRIVEN THROUGH PORES IN A CELLULOSE MATRIX. THE CELLULOSE MATRIX PORE DIAMETERS ARE ON THE ORDER OF THE DIAMETER OF DOUBLE-STRANDED DNA. THIS IS BEING ACCOMPLISHED BY CAUSING THE DNA FRAGMENTS TO MIGRATE BY REPTATING (THREADING \"END-ON\") THROUGH THE CELLULOSE MATRIX PORES. FRAGMENTS BECOME ORIENTED END-ON BEFORE THEY ENTER THE CELLULOSE MATRIX BY WAY OF A SHORT, STEEP PORE GRADIENT CONTIGUOUS WITH THE TOP OF THE CELLULOSE MEMBRANE. A SIMILAR APPROACH, USING PORE-LIMITING CONCENTRATIONS OF POLYACRYLAMIDE ELECTROPHORESIS, HAS BEEN SHOWN TO RESULT IN THE HIGH RESOLUTION SEPARATION OF DNA RESTRICTION FRAGMENTS IN LESS THAN 1 MINUTE. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THIS LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE CAN BE DUPLICATED BY EMPLOYING SIMILAR PORE DIAMETERS IN A CELLULOSE MATRIX. ADDITIONAL ADVANTAGES THAT COULD BE AFFORDED BY THE USE OF CELLULOSE MEMBRANES FOR ELECTROPHORETIC SEPARATIONS INCLUDE THEIR COMMERCIAL AVAILABILITY AND POTENTIAL FOR LONG-TERM STORAGE; UNLIKE THE NEUROTOXIC ACRYLAMIDE MONOMER AND CROSSLINKER, CELLULOSE IS NONTOXIC.

        "abstract": "In thermionic power systems, thermal radiation heat transfer between the hot emitter and cold collector constitutes a parasitic heat loss which reduces conversion and system efficiencies. After observing that the radiant heat depends linearly on the effective emissivity of the electrode pair, a method of reducing this parasitic heat loss was developed. For the typical case of tungsten emitter and niobium collector, this effective emissivity is 0.17 to 0.20. Some materials such as copper and sodium have total emissivities less than 0.10 for the typical range of collector temperatures used in space power applications. Coating the collector with such a material could potentially reduce the effective apir emissivity significantly. Phase 1 will: identify low emissivity materials which would be compatible with a converter environment; establish requirements to maintain low-emissivity surfaces by controlling emitter evaporation; and measure, in a vacuum, the radiant heat transfer in a thermionic convertor structure incorporating a low-emissivity collector surface. Estimates will be made of the impact on system performance in proposed system concepts. Phase 2, will address issues raised in fabrication and performance stability and will build and test a converter prototype.",

It is hoped that this clock will be at least two orders of magnitude more accurate than conventional Cs clocks. At present an internally funded research and development program is underway to construct a laser cooled atomic trap for Cs atoms. In the proposed research, as these Cs atoms pass through a waveguide, they will be used to detect a 9.2 GHz clock signal. The number of atoms undergoing the clock transition will be measured and the results used to control a quartz oscillator. Experiments will be performed to determine the optimum value of various parameters. This will results in data for the design of an improved clock in phase 2. A new commercial atomic clock two to three orders of magnitude better than present clocks would result in improvements in navigation, astronomy, physics, geophysical research, etc.",

All of the evaluation criteria cited in the Solicitation point toward using a fan-in-fin tail rotor and developing approaches to eliminate the tail rotor drive train and hydraulic pitch actuation mechanism, Currently, a complex mechanical system delivers power to the tail rotor. In combat, it is a source of battle damage since the tail rotor is a single-point-failure item. Hydraulic variable pitch mechanisms are also a hazard since hydraulic-fluid leaks can ignite on hot engine surfaces, SatCon Technology Corporation proposes to investigate an all-electrically- actuated fan-in-fin tail rotor for the AH-IW. This will extend the fan-in-fin tail rotor concept by adding direct electric drive of the tail rotor via an electric motor and electrical actuation of the pitch mechanism via a magnetostrictive linear actuator, Electric drive eliminates the drive train while electric pitch actuation banishes hydraulics from the tail section.

        "abstract": "THE USE OF HIGH ENERGY (E~ 1-5 MeV) ELECTRON BEAMS (HEEB) AT HIGH AVERAGE POWER (P~200 kW - 1MW) ALLOWS THE INTRODUCTION OF DEEP-LAYER COMPRESSIVE STRESSES (Q~100,000 PSI) INTO THE SURFACE OF ADVANCED STRUCTURAL CERAMICS. SURFACE STRESS LEVELS OF THIS MAGNITUDE WILL RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT ENHANCEMENT OF BEND STRENGTH, REDUCING FRACTURES RELATED TO THE AS-FABRICATED SURFACE DEFECT POPULATION. CERAMICS WITH HEEB-INDUCED, DEEP-LAYER (2-10 MM) COMPRESSIVE STRESSES WILL ALSO TOLERATE DEEPER SURFACE ABRASION DURING USE. THE STRENGTHENING PROCESS UTILIZES THE DEEP PENETRATION VOLUMETRIC HEATING ABILITY OF HIGH ENERGY ELECTRON BEAMS TO ESTABLISH A TEMPERATURE GRADIENT AT THE CERAMIC SURFACE. FOR HIGH TEMPERATURE STRUCTURAL CERAMICS WITH LOW CREEP RATES, THE GRADIENT MUST BE MAINTAINED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES AT HIGH (1500-2200oC) TEMPERATURES. SCIENCES RESEARCH LABORATORY (SRL) HAS DEVELOPED A NEW GENERATION OF PULSED INDUCTION LINEAR ACCELERATORS WHICH ALLOW RELIABLE, COST EFFCIEINT PRODUCTION OF HIGH AVERAGE POWER ELECTRON BEAMS WITH THE NECESSARY PARAMETERS FOR CERAMIC SURFACE STRENGTHENING. A UNIQUE FEATURE OF THESE ACCELERATORS IS THE HIGH REPETITION RATE (>5000 PPS) ALL-SOLID-STATE PULSED POWER DRIVERS WHICH MAKE THESE ACCELERATORS SCALABLE TO MW POWER LEVELS AT AN ELECTRON BEAM COST OF LESS THAN $2/WATT. THE INDUCTION ACCELERATOR TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED BY SRL IS CONSISTENT WITH THE POWER DENSITIES (100-1000 W/CM2) AND BEAM ENERGIES (2-5 MEV) REQUIRED FOR CERAMIC STRENGTHENING. A HEEB CERAMIC STRENGTHENING SYSTEM BASED ON THIS TECHNOLOGY IS DESCRIBED. EXPERIMENTS TO BE CONDUCTED IN PHASE II, BASED ON PHASE I SIMULATIONS AND DESIGNS WILL DEMONSTRATE THE INTRODUCTION OF SURFACE COMPRESSIVE STRESSES INTO THE HIGH TEMPERATURE STRUCTURAL CERAMICS RELEVANT TO DOD APPLICATIONS. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: ADVANCED, HIGH PURITY CERAMICS ARE CANDIDATE STRUCTURAL MATERIALS FOR USE IN ENGINES AT HIGH TEMPERATURES. ENHANCED SURFACE PROPERTIES ARE NEEDED TO IMPROVE THE FRACTURE RESISTANCE OF THESE MATERIALS. THE PROPOSED PROCESS WILL INTRODUCE LARGER SURFAVE COMPRESSIVE STRESSES AND PRODUCE THIS STRENGTHENING LAYER TO GREATER DEPTH THAN IS POSSIBLE WITH CONVENTIONAL METHODS.",

        "abstract": "WHILE COMPUTER SPEEDS HAVE BEEN DOUBLING EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS, THE PROCESS OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TENDS TO PROCEED IN THE SAME WAY AS BEFORE, ONE LINE OF CODE AT A TIME. CONCURRENT SOFTWARE DESIGN ATTEMPTS TO CHANGE THAT SEVERAL TEAM MEMBERS, OR DESIGNERS, WORK SIMULTANEOUSLY TO DEVELOP A SINGLE SOFTWARE PRODUCT. CONCURRENT DESIGN IS EXPECTED TO CUT THE DEVELOPMENT TIME SIGNIFICANTLY. SUCCESSFUL CONCURRENT DESIGN INVOLVES TWO SEEMINGLY INCOMPATIBLE ASPECTS. ONE, THE DIFFERENT DESIGNERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO WORK CONCURRENTLY (OR, SIMULTANEOUSLY) AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. AND TWO, THEY SHOULD NOT OFFSET EACH OTHER'S WORK, OR OTHERWISE PRODUCE DESIGNS THAT ARE SOMEHOW CONFLICTING. GARG AND RAGHUNATHAN [9,10] RECENTLY DESCRIBED A NOVEL SCHEME TO OBTAIN BOTH CONCURRENCY AND COMPATIBILITY WITHOUT COMPROMISING ONE FOR THE OTHER. WHILE THIS SCHEME HAS SEVERAL FEATURES THAT ARE IDEALLY SUITED FOR CONCURRENT DESIGN, ITS PERFORMANCE (IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNTS OF SHARING AND CONFLICT) IS AS YET UNTESTED. WE POINT OUT THREE KEY FACTORS THAT MIGHT ENHANCE OR ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS PERFORMANCE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO INVESTIGATE THESE FACTORS AND TO DEVELOP SCHEMES TO ENHANCE THE PERFORMANCE. WE INTEND TO PURSUE THESE GOALS BY BOTH THEORETICAL ANALYSIS AND BY EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION. IN PHASE II OF THIS PROJECT, WE INTEND TO BUILD SUCH A CONCURRENT DESIGN ENVIRONMENT. SUCH A SYSTEM, IF SUCCESSFUL, WILL GREATLY SPEED UP THE TEDIOUS AND TIME-CONSUMING PROCESS OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT.

The approach supplements the software development tasks of design/code walkthroughs and testing when a higher level of assurance is required. It differs from formal methods in that it is less formal and relies on designer/analysts to help check the correspondence. In Phase I, the requirements will be developed for the specification format and tools, which will be implemented in Phase II.

        "abstract": "Today's high rate of technological development has led to a variety of automation technologies appropriate for application in Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAV's). These technologies permit a high degree of autonomous UAV operation. Manned control over future UAV's is still required to: provide UAV tactics and mission plans, control the UAV under anomalous and/or degraded system operating states, and provide a C2 liink between the UAV and other friendly assets. An analysis tool is required to assess the utility of UAV automation alternatives to ensure that resulting UAV design concepts use manned operators efficiently. For UAV tradeoff assessments, the metrics produced by this tool should be consistent with evaluation criteria used to judge other UAV components. The tool must also provide cost benefit measures to ensure that UAV designs are affordable. This proposal addresses these needs through the development of an Automation Tradeoffs Analysis Tool (ATAT). The proposed ATAT system integrates detailed human operator, UAV mission, campaign, and cost benefit simulation models. The ATAT system incorporates a comprehensive user shell to aid designers and evaluators in performing trade studies. Phase I program deliverables include: detailed ATAT system design specifications, Phase II development plans, and a pre-prototype demonstration of the system.",

LOS position can be controlled in real time with an inertially stabilized pseudostar optical reference at the sensor's entrance aperture. The gyros that stabilize the pseudostar provide the LOS direction relative to inertial space when initialized against known stars. This concept decouples the sensor from its platform. The LOS position and control unit is comprised of a collimated light and three gyros on a hinged platform controlled by a servo system using two of the on-board gyros. The system must be compact, light weight, and have arc second angular resolution. Issues that will be addressed in Phase I include: gyro selection, system bandwidth, LOS slew rate, platform flexure, and servo system design.",

        "abstract": "Previous approaches for assessing spacecraft pointing and rapid retargeting have been considered but have been quite expensive. The proposed approach would investigate whether significant elements of STP can be demonstrated by an experiment composed of a few representative critical \"sparse\" elements, incorporated in a small satellite to be launched from a Shuttle Hitchhiker bus. Use of sparse elements will minimize the complexity, weight, and cost of the experiment, while the Hitchhiker approach will substantially reduce launch costs. Specifically, it is proposed to assess the feasiblity of being able to accurately emulate a Directed Energy Weapon spacecraft using a spatially correct satellite composed of sparse optical components. After orbital insertion, these components would be deployed out of the spacecraft to the correct relative distances. They would then represent a spacecraft-borne optical system that can be pointed and repointed to the required accuracy. Using these critical \"sparse\" elements from a representative full-scale DEW concept, combined with portrayals of accurate representative structural dynamics, it is proposed that the experiment can provide scalable large structure data. It would lend itself to demonstrating Pointing and Rapid Retargeting and to investigating and demonstrating structural dynamics associated with large deformable mirrors.",

THE DEVICE UTILIZES A HIGH Q SILICON RESONATOR INCORPORATED INTO THE SILICON HINGE OF A MONOLITHIC SILICON ACCELEROMETER. RESONATORS HAVE THE POTENTIAL OF OFFERING TRULY EXCEPTIONAL STABILITY AT VERY LOW COST AND WITH ONLY MINOR ADDITIONAL PROCESSING COMPLEXITY OVER WHAT IS NEEDED CURRENTLY. RESONANT BEAM STRUCTURES HAVE BEEN FABRICATED FOR A NUMBER OF PRESSURE SENSOR APPLICATIONS TO DEMONSTRATE EXPERIMENTAL FEASIBILITY. THIS WORK WILL BUILD UPON THE PRESSURE SENSINGTECHNOLOGY INTO A SELF-CONTAINED SILICON ACCELEROMETER STRUCTURE; AS SUCH, THIS PROJECT DOES NOT REPRESENT A PROVENCONCEPT NOR IS IT A TRIVIAL EXTENSION OF THE EXISTING TECHNOLOGY. PHASE I WOULD BE THE INITIAL PROJECT WHEREIN THE BASIC DESIGN ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED. THE INTENTION IS TO INVESTIGATE THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPLEMENTING THIS TECHNOLOGY FOR ACCELEROMETER APPLICATIONS. THE SPECIFIC DEVICE HAS BEEN CHOSEN AS A VEHICLE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THEPHYSICAL LIMITATION IN THE DESIGN OF RESONANT BEAM STRUCTURES. CONCERNS INCLUDE: RESONATOR DESIGN, TRANSDUCTION EFFICIENCY, MECHANICAL STRUCTURE DESIGN, LOW PROCESS COMPLEXITY, SIGNAL PROCESSING. EACH OF THESE MERGESFUNDAMENTAL SCIENCE WITH APPLIED ENGINEERING. THE KNOWLEDGEREGARDING SILICON MICROSTRUCTURES IS STILL SUFFICIENTLY LIMITED THAT PROPERTIES OF MATERIALS, STRUCTURAL LIMITATIONSDUE TO SILICON ETCHING, AND THE PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DESIGN ALL EFFECT PERFORMANCE. THE PURPOSE IS THREE FOLD. PRIMARILY, IT IS A STUDY OF RESONANT BEAM TRANSDUCTION APPROACHES IN A HIGHLY SENSITIVE SILICON STRUCTURE TO OBTAIN A BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE TRANSDUCTION PRINCIPALS, PERFORMANCE, AND LIMITATIONS. SECOND, IT WILL FOCUS ON A TECHNOLOGY WHICH SHOULD COMPLEMENT BOTH CONVENTIONAL SILICON PIEZORESISTIVE AND DISCRETE SINGING WIRE ACCELEROMETERS.

These techniques are very time consuming, even when performed with modern computer-controlled test systems. While they determine the electrical performance of the radome, they do not provide detailed diognostic information which can be used to \"trim\" the radome to improve it's performance. The proposed program applies high-resolution microwave imaging techniques to generate a map of transmission properties in two dementions. By comparing the radome under test to a known radome, not only can the electrical performance be quickly evaluated, but the location and magnitude of defects can be established.",

Increased contact loading forces the operator to classify contacts more rapidly, reducing his effectiveness. This study addresses the contact loading problem directly by investigating the applicability of the Cone Kernel Time Frequency Representation (CK-TFR) detection and feature extraction technique to ASW. The study will also explore intuitive man-machine interface (MMI) techniques that assist the sonar operator in managing the contact workload. Our approach uses a real-- time signal processing testbed and display system to evaluate this alternative technique, identify new classification methods and clues, and explore advanced MMI concepts. Specific issues to be examined include characterizing the performance of the CK-TFR algorithm in a real ASW signal environment, identification of additional potential classification clues, such as unique time-frequency patterns of transients, and user displays and controls which optimize operability.",

IN PRINCIPLE, SUCH PROCESSORS CAN REPLACE TRADITIONAL SPECIAL-PURPOSE, HARD-WIRED SYSTEMS FOR MANY HIGH-PERFORMANCE SIGNAL PROCESSING APPLICATIONS, PROVIDING FULL PROGRAMMABILITY AS WELL AS IMPORTANT ECONOMIC ADVANTAGES. THE KEY PROBLEM WITH MASSIVELY-PARALLEL ARCHITECTURES, HOWEVER, IS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REQUIRED INTERPROCESSOR COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK, WHICH GROWS RAPIDLY IN COMPLEXITY AS THE NUMBER OF PROCESSING ELEMENTS INCREASES. IN OUR APPROACH, WE EMPLOY FREE-SPACE OPTICAL INTERCONNECTS WITHIN A STACKED-SUBSTRATE MCM STRUCTURE TO IMPLEMENT A HIGHLY-PARALLEL, EXTREMELY HIGH-BANDWIDTH NETWORK. IN ORDER FOR THE LIGHT TO BE TRANSMITTED THROUGH THE SUBSTRATES, A SUBSTRATE MATERIAL TRANSPARENT TO THE WAVELENGTH EMPLOYED IS USED (OR ALTERNATIVELY, SMALL HOLES ARE FABRICATED IN THINNED PORTIONS OF THE SUBSTRATE). THE SUBSTRATES ARE HELD TOGETHER IN COMPRESSION WITH SPACER ELEMENTS MADE FROM THE SAME MATERIAL AS THE SUBSTRATE, PERMITTING THE FABRICATION OF KEYING STRUCTURES WHICH MAINTAIN PRECISE REGISTRATION (TO WITHIN A FEW MICRONS) AS WELL AS ALLOWING INDIVIDUAL SUBSTRATES TO BE REMOVED FOR REPAIR. THE OPTICAL TRANSMITTERS AND RECEIVERS ARE MOUNTED ON THE SUBSTRATED WITH FLIP-CHIP SOLDER BONDING TECHNIQUES, WHICH PERMIT REGISTRATION OF THESE DEVICES ON THEIR SUBSTRATES TO AN ACCURACY OF ABOUT TWO MICRONS AS WELL AS ANGULAR ALIGNMENT TO WITHIN 0.05 DEGREE.

        "abstract": "An improved insulator material is proposed for use in space nuclear reactors. This material is for the insulator of the trilayer of a thermionic fuel element (TFE). This insulator must withstand rigorous conditions of long life at high temperature under exposure to nuclear radiation. Previous work has studied alumina, YAG, and diamond as possible RFE insulator materials. cBN is similar to diamond in many ways: high thermal conductivity, refractory, and large bandgap for high electrical resistivity. This material can potentially enable longer life in space nuclear reactors. Like diamond, cBN has been expensive to produce in bulk. However, recent experiments have shown that cBN can be readily deposited in thin film coatings. This is accomplished through a laser ablation deposition process. Laser deposition using long wavelength lasers (Nd: YAG operating in fundamental or second harmonics) have only produced BN films of hexagonal crystal structure. But laser deposition using excimer lasers operating in the UV show good promise. Work in the excimer laser deposition of boron nitride films on SI indicated that the resulting BN films of cubic zincblende structure. Regions of films also exhibit technique in cBN film preparation. BN films will be prepared by excimer laser deposition. The films will be characterized by scanning electron microscopy, raman spectroscopy, and x-ray diffraction. The effect of laser wavelength on the CN film crystal formation will be studied.",

By modulating the wavelengths of the etalon filter peaks, the plume radiation can be absorbed periodicially, while the background radiation remains largely unaffected. The target will be therefore enhanced to background contrast as the background signal is suppressed relative to the plume signature.",

What's more, by replacing hard-to-make aluminum-containing compounds with GaAs-Ge, Spire can make HBTs better and cheaper. Best of all, by choosing the right alloy, HBTs can be grown directly on GaAs wafers, then integrated with other electronic and optoelectronic devices.

By extending SIMOX waveguide technology, Spire will demonstrate multi-dimensional, all-electronic laser beam steering. Parallel arrays of electronically phase-modulated waveguide structures will be fabricated, configured to spatially dissect an incident coherent planar waveform, and used to rotate the output light beam through constructive interference effects in the field. A two-dimensional array of phase-control channels would allow scanning the beam over the entire image plane. Initial efforts will focus on fabrication and test of a two channel, vertically situated set of waveguides featuring two buried SiO2 layers. Integration of two sets of guides into a two dimensional structure will allow rapid agile steering.",

WE HOPE TO DEVELOP A NOVEL METHOD OF POLISHING DIAMONDS, ION BEAM SPUTTER POLISHING. BY EXPOSING DIAMOND BLADES TO AN ENERGETIC STREAM OF IONS, IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO RELIABLY AND REPEATABLY POLISH THE BLADES TO VERY SMALL TIP DIMENSIONS (PRELIMINARY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT TIP WIDTHS AS SMALL AS 20-30 NONOMETERS CAN BE ACHIEVED).

        "abstract": "Future space power and propulsion systems will be hot, hotter than materials can stand. They'll need active cooling for the toughest spots, either heat pipes (with recoverable coolant) or fuel channels. In general, heat transfer in these devices improves as capillary sizes shrink, but they cannot be arbitrary reduced without eventually causing blockages and catastrophic hot spots. Instead, Spire proposes to keep the larger passages but micro-texture inner surfaces by ion beams to increase surface area, similar to using internal vanes. For really hot applications, this will also increase thermal emissivity, something ordinary capillaries cannot do. Feature sizes much smaller than optical wavelengths make micro-textured metals broadband light absorbers, nearly perfect blackbodies that radiate more effectively than plain metal surfaces. The extra radiational heat transfer could really make a difference. Texture blakening will improve active cooling or nucleate boiling in hypersonic aircraft, fast computers, high power x-ray sources, adiabatic or Stirling engines, and other advanced systems.",

Of particular interest are temporal and spatial light modulators, which find applications in optical interconnects, optical computing, and logic circuits. Spire will characterize an advanced GaAs multi-quantum well structure which will exhibit the Lateral-Electric-Field-Induced-Refraction (LEFIR) effect. The lightwave propogates transverse to the stack of grown layers, while the electric field, applied laterally due to the removal of a two-dimensional electron gas supplied by planar doping, induces changes in the refractive index of the active region containing the quantum wells. The transmissive modes are shifted in wavelength when the effective refractive index of the active region is altered by the applied field, modulating intensity. Without mirrors, the device can shift the phase of incident light. EFIR modulators can be extended into two-dimensional arrays with applications as spatial light modulators.",

Spire proposes a clever way around this, doubly clever because it's based on well known materials and methods combined in new ways. Starting with GaAs, an excellent choice for high-speed electronics but an infrared dead-head, by mixing in a little Ge, Spire will create a new alloy which is optically alive and fits perfectly on GaAs substrates. Infrared emitters and detectors can be built in the alloy, fast electronics in the GaAs. If this works, Spire argues, it's lower cost and higher reliability will knock existing infrared technologies right out of the market for fiber optic communications.",

Azacubane is a nitrogen derivative of cubane and has more favorable properties. The basic reason for the high energy content of cubane is the distortion of carbon-carbon bonds which comprise its structure. Azacubane incorporates this element of strain energy but because of the presence of one or more nitrogen atoms, this new material has totally different chemical and physical properties. Chemical synthesis will be used to make azacubanes in quantities sufficient for preliminary evaluation. Also synthetic routes will be investigated for the purpose of scaling up the synthesis with a view towards future manufacture. The end goal is to develop an economical synthesis for these powerful and exciting materials.",

EXPOSURE OF THE MEMBRANES TO X-RAY FILM RESULTS IN HYBRIDIZATION SIGNALS SIGNIFYING THE LOCATION F OVERLAPPING CLONES. ADJACENT NEGATIVE CLNE POSITIONS ARE REQUENTLY COUNTED AS POSITIVE BECAUSE OF SIGNAL \"SPILL-OVER\".

RAPID HYBRIDIZATION (1 HOUR) OF BIOTINYLATED END-SPECIFIC DNA PROBES TO THEIR TARGETS ON NYLON FILTERS ON NYLON FILTERS IS FOLLOWED BY BINDING OF AVIDIN-ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE CONJUGATES. A CHEMILUMINESCENT SUBSTRATE FOR THE ENZYME IS SUPPLIED AND LIGHT IS PRODUCED. THE FIBER OPTIC COMPONENT OF THE PCD IS POSITIONED DIRECTLY DIRECTLY OVER THE LOCATION OF CLONED COSMID DNA AND LIGHT INTENSITY IS MEASURED. SINCE DATA IS RECEIVED AND OUTPUT AS COUNTS PER SECOND, AN ACCURATE REPRESENTATION OF HYBRIDIZATION QUALITY OF PROBES TO THEIR TARGETS WILL BE ACHIEVED.

All of these undersea structures are required to be energy absorptive. FRP materials offer significantly increased energy absorption with respect to conventional materials used in these applications. Innovative technology is needed to formulate FRP resins that will effectively reduce acoustic transmissions within this type of construction. Hybrid resin systems, such as polyurethane-polyester, urethane-acrylate, rubber modified resins, and thermoplastic fiber/thermoset resin combinations, provide the potential for high acoustic damping and will be evaluated in this research program. The prime focus of this work will be the development of high strength resin systems based on existing technology that will reduce radiated noise in undersea structures. These resin formulations will be evaluated using proven energy absorption design approaches for FRP laminates, which can reduce acoustic emissions in undersea structures without degrading structural efficiency. A test program is defined to evaluate the acoustic transmission levels, over a frequency range of 100 Hz to 4000 Hz, and the structural properties of the FRP laminates. Structural Composites, Inc. (SCI) is uniquely qualified and possesses all of the capability in-house to perform this work, with the exception of specialized test equipment that must be used. Our successful experience, our interactive relationship with the resin and materials manufacturers, and our innovative approach to the problem make SCI the most promising key to a solution.",

MANY DNAPLS ARE CHARACTERIZED AS BEING IMMISCIBLE WITH AND HEAVIER THAN WATER. THESE CHARACTERISTICS COMBINE TO MAKE SUBSURFACE DNAPL CONTAMINATION PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT TO REMEDIATE. IN GENERAL, DNAPLS RELEASED TO THE SUBSURFACE MIGRATE DOWNWARD LEAVING BEHIND RESIDUAL SATURATION CONCENTRATIONS IN THE UNSATURATED AND SATURATED ZONES. IF RELEASED IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES, THE DNAPL WILL FORM A FREE PHASE ON IMPERMEABLE MATERIALS AT THE BASE OF THE SATURATED ZONE. THE RESIDUAL SATURATION AND FREE PHASE DNAPLS IN THE SATURATED ZONE REPRESENT A LONG TERM SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION FOR GROUND WATER BECAUSE THEIR AQUEOUS SOLUBILITY IS MUCH HIGHER THAN THEIR ALLOWABLE DRINKING WATER STANDARD. THE KEY TO REMEDIATION IS REMOVAL OF THE RESITUAL AND FREE DNAPL FROM THE SUBSURFACE. SURFACTANTS IN SOLUTION CAN EMULSIFY OR SOLUBILIZE RESIDUAL OR FREE DNAPLS IN THE SATURATED ZONE IF SYSTEMS CAN BE DESIGNED WHICH WILL NOT EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT LOSSES DUE TO ADSORPTION OR PRECIPITATION. THE SURFACTANT SYSTEM MUST BE SELECTED BASED ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DNAPL, THE AQUIFER SOLID MEDIA, THE GROUND WATER, AND THE RESERVOIR TEMPERATURE IF IT IS TO BE EFFECTIVE. THE OBJECTIVES OF THE PROPOSED STUDY ARE TO ASSESS THE VIABILITY OF USING SUCH SURFACTANTS OR SURFACTANT SYSTEMS TO REMOVE FREE AND RESIDUAL SATURATIONS OF DNAPLS FROM SATURATED SOILS BY EITHER MECHANISM, EMULSIFICATION OR SOLUBIZATION, IN A TEN CUBIC FOOT TEST CELL.",

MICELLAR-ENHANCED ULTRAFILTRATION (MEUF) IS A NEW PROCESS WHICH CAN REMOVE DISSOLVED ORGANICS AND MULTIVALENT METAL IONS FROM WATER. IN MEUF, AN IONIC SURFACTANT, WHICH FORMS AGGREGATES CALLED MICELLES, IS ADDED TO WATER. ORGANIC AND METALLIC SPECIES ASSOCIATE OR BIND WITH THE MICELLES.

REDUCTIONS IN CONCENTRATION OF TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE IN ONE PASS HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN PRELIMINARY WORK.

To accomplish this, they must leverage technologies, both new and old, to their fullest extent. One of the main obstacles to taking advantage of the wealth of software technologies available to these institutions is the problem of integrating these applications into a cohesive cooperative whole. This is a mission critical requirement for several reasons. The current sequential manner in which steps in the process of producing manufacturable product are executed essentially guarantees long and expensive iterations between design, prototyping, and manufacturing. If the various software tools used along the way could be integrated this sequential step by step approach would become inherently more of a cooperative concurrent process. Furthermore, if the approach taken to integration were systematic and non-intrusive, new technologies could be added as they become available allowing the coexistance of state of the art technology with established proven technology. This proposal presents an integration framework which provides such a solution.",

THE NEED FOR COMPUTERIZED COMMUNICATIONS AND COORDINATION SYSTEMS TO FACLITATE JOINT DECISION MAKING IS VITAL TO THE SUCCESS OF RURAL AMERICA FMNS. SYNERGY SYSTEMS CONSULTING PROPOSES TO DESIGN A DISTRIBUTED PRODUCTION COORDINATION SYSTEM, OR DCPS IN RESPONSE TO THIS NEED. THE DCPS CONSISTS OF A SET OF LINKED SPREADSHEETS STORED ON MICROCOMPUTERS AT EACH FMN LOCATION. THIS SPREADSHEET PROVIDES A MODEL OF THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS, AND IS LINKED TO THE OTHER FMN PARTNERS THROUGH COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS. FMN PARTNERS ENTER INFORMATION INTO THE SPREADSHEET, WHICH AUTOMATICALLY RELAYS THE INFORMATION TO THE OTHER PARTNERS. THE DCPS MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR FMN PARTNERS TO ACHIEVE JOINT PRODUCTION CONTROL, AND MUTUAL DECISION MAKING.",

This approach may provide improved capabilities for target detection and identification through examination of target resonance characteristics. Detection and processing of short duration, ultrawideband pulses that have random time intervals between pulses require new approaches to receiver design. Analog-to-digital conversion of ultrawideband signals for processing of resonance features is a major challenge for the development of this technology. TACAN Corporation proposes a new approach that converts single electromagnetic pulses into optical pulse trains that preserve the signal waveform for analog-to-digital conversion and facilitates signal processing. This approach uses a fiber-optic-coupled antenna and other fiber-optic components to build a circulating delay line and repeater, and allows analog-to-conversion for accurately recording the short duration return waveform. Applications include military sensors, remote inspection of structures, environmental sensing, and geophysical surveying.",

Critical components, especially those containing highly reflective optical surfaces, may become obvious targets by reflecting light from laser designators or from sunlight. Applying appropriate coatings to the optical surfaces surpresses reflectivity by light scattering and absorption, but these applied coatings tend to interfere with the optical properties of the component. Takom will develop a technique using ion beam surface modification to produce ultralow reflectivity optical components without affecting essential optical properties of the parent material. With proper choice of exposure parameters, this process will generate a surface topology such that the material on the scale of the wavelength of light appears to have a smoothly changing mass density. Therefore, a smoothly graded refractive index through a surface layer will result in a significant reduction in reflectivity.",

THIS NEW APPROACH INVOLVES AN ENZYME-BASED COLLECTION SYSTEM TO UTILIZE ATMOSPHERIC CARBON DIOXIDE ALLOWING DENSE, SUSTAINED ALGAL PRODUCTION. NATURALLY, ALGAE OBTAIN CARBON DIOXIDE, USED AS THEIR CARBON SOURCE, FROM SURROUNDING WATER WHICH IS SLOWLY REPLENISHED FROM ATMOSPHERIC CARBON DIOXIDE. RECENTLY, IT HAS BEEN CLEARLY ESTABLISHED THAT ALGAL GROWTH IN AQUACULTURE SYSTEMS CAN BE GREATLY ENHANCED BY THE ARTIFICIAL ADDITION OF EXTRA CARBON DIOXIDE. PRESENTLY THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY COMMERCIAL COMPRESSED CARBON DIOXIDE BUBBLED IN THE WATER OF THE AQUACULTURE SYSTEM. WHILE EFFECTIVE, THIS IS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE. THE PROPOSED PROCESS USES AN ENZYME, CARBONIC ANHYDRASE, TO EFFECTIVELY TRAP ATMOSPHERIC CARBON DIOXIDE AND EQUILIBRATE IT RAPIDLY WITHIN THE AQUACULTURE WATER. THIS PROPOSAL CALLS FOR LABORATORY SCALE TESTING OF THE PROCESS, OPTIMIZATION OF OPERATING, AND SCALE MODEL TESTING WITH A VARIETY OF ALGAL CULTURES. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY WILL PROVIDE THE NECESSARYINFORMATION FOR TESTING THE PROCESS WITH LARGE SCALE COMMERCIAL AQUACULTURE (PHASE II).

PHASE I OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF JOINING MULTIPLE TUBES OF SIC TO A PLATE OF REACTION-BONDED SILICON CARBIDE (RBSC), A MATERIAL PRODUCED THROUGH INFILTRATION OF A CARBON-SIC PREFORM WITH MOLTEN SILICON. THIS TYPE OF SIC-RBSC ASSEMBLY IS THE BUILDING BLOCK OF A NOVEL CERAMIC HEAT EXCHANGER FOR ADVANCED COAL-FIRED POWER SYSTEMS. IN PHASE I, SIC-RBSC JOINTS ARE BEING MADE USING A MULTIMODE MICROWAVE APPLICATOR, WITH AN INSULATED ENCLOSURE THAT PROVIDES RADIANT AS WELL AS MICROWAVE HEATING. THE EFFECT OF HEATING TIME AND JOINING TEMPERATURE ON THE MECHANICAL AND MICROSTRUCTURAL PROPERTIES OF THE JOINED SPECIMENS ARE BEING STUDIED; THE JOINTS WILL BE SUBJECTED TO TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE CYCLING TO SIMULATE SERVICE CONDITIONS.",

THE TWO KEY PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF IRF DESIGN ARE THE POROUS, PARTICULATE ELECTRODES AND THE RADIAL DESIGN. PARTICULATE ELECTRODES ELIMINATE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY MISMATCHES IN THE THERMAL EXPANSION COEFFICIENT, BY ALLOWING THE SEPARATOR, SEALS, AND ELECTROLYTE TO EXPAND AT DIFFERENT RATES AND CHANGE POSITION WITH RESPECT TO THE ELECTRODE, WITHOUT LOSING ELECTRICAL CONTACT. NOVEL AND IMPROVED MATERIALS CAN BE INCORPORATED AND OPTIMIZED FOR ELECTRICAL AND CATALYTIC PROPERTIES RATHER THAN FOR THERMAL EXPANSION PROPERTIES. SIMPLE, INEXPENSIVE MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES CAN BE USED, SUCH AS TAPE CASTING AND STAMPING. THE RADIAL DESIGN ALLOWS INTERNAL MANIFOLDING OF THE FUEL AND OXIDANT INLET STREAMS, WHICH MINIMIZES THE REQUIRED SEAL AREA. NO EXHAUST MANIFOLDS ARE NEEDED. PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTS USING SINGLE CELLS HAVE PROVED THE FEASIBILITY OF USING PARTICULATE ELECTRODES. SEALING PROBLEMS, IDENTIFIED IN STACK TESTS, CAN BE CORRECTED BY OPTIMIZED SEALS. SEAL MATERIALS MUST BE OPTIMIZED FOR PHYSICAL PROPERTIES SUCH AS SOFTENING TEMPERATURE, VISCOSITY, ADHESION TO SURFACES, AND WETTING OF SURFACES, AND FOR GEOMETRIC FACTORS SUCH AS INITIAL HEIGHT AND WIDTH, AND DIMENSIONAL CHANGE WITH THERMAL EXPANSION.

In our opinion, the most promising approach for rapid advancement in this area will focus on the application of improved decision making and signal interpretation algorithms to currently available signal processing technology. This proposal is for a program of basic research and exploratory development to develop an improved signal interpretation algorithm for classifying a digitally processed acoustic signal based on an approach known as linear programming (LP) discriminant analysis. It is proposed the LP discriminant analysis, as a pattern classification technique, be applied to the pattern vector obtained by digitizing the spectral shape of a sonar signal. LP discriminant analysis offers several advantages over classical discriminant analysis including freedom from the classical statistical assumptions and significantly enhanced classification power. These properties make the technique well suited to pattern recognition applications including the training of neural networks.",

This family of liquids has very high drift velocity and low conduction losses for electrons within a particular energy band. The liquid is not subjected to ionization, it simply acts as a conductor of electricity or as an insulator. It has a much higher dielectric strength than gases or semiconductors of similar size. This technology is not related to a liquid spark gap because the liquid is not broken down during conduction. The repetition rate potentialof the switch appears to be very good with 10's of kHz perhaps being achievable. This switch will have primary commercial applications to current interruption devices for commercial electric power utilities, for controlling repetitive medical accelerators, and for controlling x-ray lithography units.

THE NEXT STEP IS TO UNDERSTAND THE COUPLING, AT THE MOLECULAR DIPOLE LEVEL, TO THE ELECTRICAL STRESS AND THE INDUCED MECHANICAL DEFORMATION. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: WIDE APPLICATIONS FOR LINE INSPECTION OF POLYMERS PRODUCING AND COATED HIGH VOLTAGE CABLE TRANSMISSION LINES FOR POWER DISTRIBUTION.

Accelerated life testing (ALT) is a technique used to obtain reliability data in a compressed time frame, allowing lifetime performance predictions and failure mode analyses to be made prior to equipment installation. By performing activation energy laboratory experiments on samples of the SSN-21 hull coating material, TRI/Austin will determine the ratio of accelerated aging rate, under elevated stress conditions, to real-time aging rate. information, an ALT exposure schedule will be designed that can aging; by repeating the exposure schedule, the lifetime reliability and performance characteristics of the SSN-21 hull coating may be predicted. An existing computer software ALT design model will be refined to provide the ability to incorporate different service operating conditions, in-port climates, and activation energies. The computer model will allow modification of mission profile information, through convenient user-interface options, in order to produce new ALT",

THE APPROACH PROPOSED CONSISTS OF A DETAILED, MECHANISTIC AND PHYSICALLY REALISTIC MODEL. IT EMPLOYS ELEMENTS OF SPRAY COMBUSTION MODELING WHEREBY DROPLETS ARE DIVIDED INTO REPRESENTATIVE GROUPS AND THESE GROUPS ARE TRACKED AS THEY ARE HEATED, EVAPORATE, BREAKUP, AND MOVE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF GRAVITY AND LOCAL WINDS. THIS IS A WELL ESTABLISHED AND SUCCESSFUL APPROACH THAT CAN BE EASILY ADAPTED FOR FUEL DROPLETS FALLING THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE. IN ORDER TO KEEP THE MODEL RUN TIME SHORT ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS APPROACH FEASIBLE FOR A MICROCOMPUTER, ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF THE JETTISONED FUEL WILL BE MODELED IN DETAIL. THE FINAL DISPOSITION OF THE REMAINDER OF THE JETTISONED FUEL CAN BE INFERRED FROM THE TRAJECTORIES AND IMPACT POINTS OF THE FUEL THAT IS TRACKED IN DETAIL. THIS IS MADE POSSIBLE BY DIVIDING THE FLIGHT PATH DURING DUMPING INTO SEGMENTS DURING WHICH THE FORCES ACTING ON THE FUEL DROPLETS DO NOT VARY WITH DUMP LOCATION. ONE OF THE MAJOR OBSTACLES TO THIS APPROACH (OR ANY OTHER REALISTIC APPROACH) TO THIS MODEL IS THE INABILITY TO PREDICT THE INITIAL DROPLET SIZE DISTRIBUTION. WHILE SOME EXCELLENT DATA IS AVAILABLE, IT IS LIMITED TO ONLY A FEW CONDITIONS OF INTEREST, AND THERE IS LITTLE BASIS FOR EXTRAPOLATING THIS DATA TO OTHER AIRCRAFT, FLIGHT PROFILES, FUELS, ETC.

        "abstract": "High performance graphite/resin composites have not realized their potential because they have poor interface-dependent mechanical properties that degrade by as much as 65% under hot-wet conditions. An RF-plasma/wet-chemistry fiber surface treatment is proposed to establish covalent bonding between the graphite fiber/resin matrix interface. The plasma process will establish reactive moieties on the relatively inert crystallite basal plane of the graphite fiber. The wet-chemical treatment will covalently bond the resin matrix to the reactive plasma-generated moieties thus forming the interfacial covalent bond. The covalently bonded interfaces will improve interface-dependent mechanical properties by at least 50% and prevent degradation of these properties under hot-wet conditions. Prior work that established interfacial covalent bonds in OCF S-2 glass/polysulfone composites demonstrated that interface-dependent mechanical properties degraded by less than 8% during 106 degree C-9 RH aging conditions. Basal plane reactivity treatments will be conducted in a spectrometer-controlled plasma research reactor facility. Titration, IGC, surgace energetics and ESCA techniques will characterize the graphite surface. Processes will be developed for wet-chemical bonding. Peel tests of two-ply laminates subjected to hot-wet aging will provide proof of increased interfacial adhesion.",

        "abstract": "1Titanium compressor blades suffer unacceptable erosion damage to solid impact. Polymeric protective coatings are ineffective in solid particle environments and are unable to withstand the high temperature environment of the T64 engine compressor. The broad damage area of compressor blades makes metallic protective coatings, such as have been developed for helicopter blades, unacceptable from a weight penalty. Conventional ceramic coatings have demonstrated excellent erosion resistance, but have been erratic in performance, difficult to apply to complex surfaces, and have poor adherence properties. A sol-gel derived ceramic coating offers tailorable porosity characteristics which should optimize erosion and toughness properties. The sol-gel process lends itself to applications to complex surfaces. A novel reactive primer will covalently bond the ceramic coating to the titanium substrate. Sol-gel processing studies will address tailorability of the alumina-silicate composition and microstructure. Pull-off tests will assess coating adherence achieved by the reactive primer. DNA's dust erosion facility will be used to determine solid impact erosion resistance as a function of ceramic coating characteristics. Fatigue life and repair tests will be conducted to assess the application limits of this coating. TPL will be assisted by the Center for Micro-Engineered Ceramics in coating development and PDA Engineering in erosion testing.

Within the soccer ball shaped fullerene molecule, the bonding between carbon atoms are very strong, and the molecule has considerable structural stability. The intermolecular bonding is weak and is due to van der Waals attraction. Based on this background information, it is easy to imagine that these loosely bonded balls can roll and slip when placed between two sliding surfaces thus providing solid lubrication. UES Inc, proposed to develop thin coatings of these materials using physical vapor deposition and bond the coating with a surface using very high energy (~MeV) ion beams. The evaluation of physical and tribological properties of these coatings will determine their future applications as a solid lubricant.",

DESPITE ADVANCES IN DIAGNOSIS, SUPPORTIVE CARE AND TREAMENT, MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY FROM THESE INFECTIONS CONTINUE TO BE SUBSTANTIAL. OF THE FOUR CAPSULAR TYPES, TYPE III STRAINS ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE ISOLATES ASSOCIATES WITH INVASIVE NEONATAL INFECTIONS.

IN MANY CASES, THE POOR IMMUNOGENICITY OF THESE CPS WAS IMPROVED BY THE PRODUCTION OF CONJUGATED VACCINES. COVALENTLY BINDING CPS TO CARRIER PROTEINS MADE THEM BETTER IMMUNOGENS AS EVIDENCED BY ELICITING HIGHER NATIBODY LEVELS, AND T-CELL DEPENDENT IMMUNE RESPONSE.

To date, a satisfactory plastic band configuration for high performance 20mm AGT ammunition has not been developed. A combination of plastic materials that are subject to stress cracking and unsatisfactory retention concepts make current plastic band configurations unacceptable for the AGT combat projectile. Promising new plastics combined with mechanical and chemical retention mechanisms that are enhanced by a comprehensive surface cleaning procedure for superior adhesion, are expected to result in an excellent plastic rotating band for AGT projectiles. The combinations of high strength plastics and high retention strength will make it possible to mold a unitary band, increase band driving pressure, and reduce band length to avoid the problems caused by twist increases in gain twist rifling. A baseline plastic band design concept featuring a high strength, stress crack resistant engineering plastic and a chemically bonded mechanical retention concept are described and recommended for evaluation.",

THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CORE PRESENTATION, AND INTEGRATED TRAINING MODEL, AND RESOURCE MATERIALS, VSA EDUCATIONAL SERVICES WILL PROVIDE THE NECESSARY RESOURCES FOR THE TROUPES TO EXECUTE THE LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM ON STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS. THIS MODEL PROGRAM WILL BE BASED ON THE MOST RECENT RESEARCH CONDUCTED ON LEADERSHIP TRAINING AND WILL BE DEVELOPED IN COLLABORATION WITH NATIONAL YOUTH ORGANIZATIONS. THE PROGRAM WILL BE THE FIRST EDUCATIONAL INITIATIVE THAT TAILORS LEADERSHIP TRAINING TO YOUTH WITH DISABILITIES. WHEN DELIVERED AS PERFORMANCES AND WORKSHOPS BY THE TOURING TROUPES, THIS PROGRAM WILL REPRESENT A CREATIVE RESOURCE FOR TAPPING THE LEADERSHIP POTENTIAL OF ALL YOUTH AND PROMOTING GREATER INTEGRATION OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AS LEADERS IN SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES NATIONWIDE.",

        "abstract": "ViaSat proposes to develop a set of protocols to allow voice users to efficiently use the full range of available digital networks available to Navy platforms. The protocols will have extensive flexibility, in order co work on narrow-band HF channels, as well as higher bandwidth packet oriented networks. By decoupling the voice link control information from the actual voice data, we can take advantage of multimedia networks to provide for separate transmission paths. By aggressively manipulating the underlying vocoded structures we can also obtain additional compression. Since the voice will share the same digital networks as data users, the Navy will obtain great benefits in total network performance, no longer needing to set aside special channels for voice. ViaSat will provide characterizations of the full range of RF media which can be used for voice, and provide protocol parameters for compatability with each of these media types. ViaSat will also develop the means to connect into the public switch network, to provide \"direct-dialing\" from any participating platform to the world of telephone comoiunications. The proposed approach provides direct support for the Copernicus architecture.",

Our performance modeling environment takes into account all of the aspects of automatic DAMA control, including; the constrints due to DAMA terminals and technical interface standard,s selection of observable statistics to measure, definition of system stochastic input paramters, and computer software that ties it all together. The proposed Phase I work includes analysis and simulation to quantify system performance under a variety of statellite configuration, terminal, operational, and traffic models. It also includes actual real-time simulation of candidate automatic DAMA control strategies that prove the value of the performance model. A successful Phase I feasibility program leads directly to a UHF on-the-air Phase Ii proof-of-concpet demonstration, including measurements to verify performance predicted in Phase I.

THIS SOLIDS FLOW METER UTILIZES A BEAM OF POLARIZED LIGHT THAT PASSES THROUGH THE MAGNETIC FIELD GENERATED BY CHARGED PARTICLES FLOWING IN A PIPE. THE PARTICLES CAN BE CHARGED NATURALLY BY BOMBARDING A NONCONDUCTIVE WALL, OR THEY CAN BE CHARGED ARTIFICIALLY BY USING A CORONA DISCHARGE PROBE. THE FLOW OF THE CHARGED PARTICLES THROUGH THE PIPE CAN BE LIKENED TO A CURRENT FLOW AND, CONSEQUENTLY, A MAGNETIC FIELD CAN BE PRODUCED. THE DEGREE OF POLARIZATION SHIFT IS A DIRECT MEASURE OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD PRODUCED, AND THIS FIELD STRENGTH IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE AMOUNT OF SOLIDS FLOWING IN A PIPE.

ASH FROM THESE FACILITIES IS PRODUCED AT RATES RANGING FROM 10 TO 100 TONS PER DAY, WITH DISPOSAL COSTS AVERAGING $100 TO $150 PER TON. IN SOME LOCATIONS, THE CONCENTRATIONS OF METALS IN THE ASH IS SUFFICIENTLY HIGH TO CLASSIFY THE ASH AS A HAZARDOUS WASTE. ADDITIONALLY, THE VOLUME OF SLUDGE INCINERATOR ASH, FUGITIVE DUST EMISSIONS FROM ASH PILES, AND THE COST OF DISPOSAL ARE KEY ISSUES FACING THE MUNICIPALITIES THAT OPERATE THESE PLANTS. TO TREAT SLUDGE INCINERATOR ASH, THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ADVANCED COAL-FIRED COMBUSTION/MELTING SYSTEM THAT WILL PRODUCE A NONHAZARDOUS VITRIFIED PRODUCT, REDUCE THE ASH VOLUME, ELIMINATE DUSTING, AND REDUCE DISPOSAL COSTS IS PLANNED. THIS TECHNOLOGY IS BASED ON AN ADVANCED COAL-FIRED GLASS MELTING PROCESS HEATER BEING DEVELOPED WITH SUPPORT FROM THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY. PHASE I OF THIS PROJECT INVOLVES THE FEASIBILITY TESTING OF THE VITRIFICATION PROCESS ON A SCALE OF 10 TO 15 TONS PER DAY. THE PROCESS PRODUCES A VITRIFIED (GLASSY) MATERIAL SUITABLE FOR USE AS AN AGGREGATE IN ROAD PAVING OR VARIOUS MUNICIPAL PROJECTS AND WITH POTENTIAL BROADER USE IN CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS. ALTERNATIVELY, IF PLACED IN A LANDFILL, THE RESULTING PRODUCT IS A NONHAZARDOUS MATERIAL AND HAS A REDUCED VOLUME COMPARED WITH THE ORIGINAL ASH. THIS RESULTS IN A NET SAVINGS IN DISPOSAL COSTS.",

XEMET's technology will remove on the order of 5 KW per square centimeter, with a temperature drop of 1 to 2 degrees C. per KW. XEMET's approach avoids the plumbing, pumping, sealing, clogging and the erosion problems of microchannel cooling.

Additional benefits are higher laser duty cycles, better reliability, longer life and improved optical performance.",

A simper, lighter, more reliable, and less expensive power supply is desired. Support systems based on capacitive energy storage are attractive for this application. They are power-rich, simple, reliable, safe, quiet, and maintenance-free. The goal of the proposed effort is to establish the feasibility of double-layer capacitor technology for the power support system. In Phase I, a single capacitor will be designed that delivers 15 kW average power for 0.1 seconds. It will have a sealed package, be capable of 15- to 120-V operation via external buss connections, and have a volume less than 1 cubic foot. One capacitor will be constructed per this design. Its performance will be measured and compared with the design goals. The capacitor will be delivered to the Navy for further evaluations. Successful completion of the proposed Phase I activity will yield a simple and reliable breadboard power system. It will be capable of delivering one-fifth the power specified for the eventual power support system.",

Existing analog synapse designs are highly non- linear or require expensive fabrication processes. Our new linear synapse circuit is small, allows for on-chip learning, and uses standard CMOS bulk technology and so resulting neural network chips can be fabricated inexpensively by many vendors. We propose to develop, simulate, layout, and fabricate our new linear synapse circuit during Phase I. We expect to show density improvements of more than 100 over existing circuit designs. This proposed research applies our experience in analog circuits and neural network circuits to create a major improvement in functionality of artificial neural network systems.",
