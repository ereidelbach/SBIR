IN ORDER FOR THESE PATTERNING TECHNIQUES TO BE USEFUL, THE DEFECT DENSITY OF THE FINAL PRODUCT MUST BE VERY TIGHTLY CONTROLLED AND EXTREMELY LOW (LESS THAN 0.5 PER SQ.IN). TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, SEVERAL APPROACHES WILL BE INVESTIGATED. THEY ARE: 1. PLASMA ASSISTED DEVELOPMENT OF THICK RESIST MATERIALS. IN THIS STEP RESIST FILMS WILL BE USED IN THE 6,000 TO 8,000 A RANGE, WET DEVELOPED AND THE PLASMA CLEANED TO REMOVE THE REMAINING RESIST MATERIAL. THE SOLVENT CHEMISTRY IS USED TO FORM A PARTIAL RELIEF IMAGE WHICH WILL THEN BE ENHANCED BY PLASMA TREATMENT. 2. VARIATIONS IN ACCELERATING VOLTAGE WILL BE INVESTIGATED TO PRODUCE HIGHER CONTRAST EXPOSURE. THESE PARAMETERS WILL BE FIRST MODELED THROUGH COMPUTER SIMULATION AND THEN PRODUCED IN RESIST AND CHECKED BY SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY ANALYSIS. 3.

THE MAIN STANDARDS CURRENTLY IN COMMON USE UTILIZE QUARTZ-CRYSTAL OSCILLATORS CUT TO THE AT ORIENTATION. A PRIMARY CANDIDATE FOR MEETING THE REQUIREMENT FOR IMPROVED TIME/FREQUENCY STANDARDS IS SC-CUT QUARTZ, WHICH OFFERS MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS IN STABILITY AND PERFORMANCE OVER AT-CUT QUARTZ OSCILLATORS. UNFORTUNATELY, X-RAY ORIENTATION EQUIPMENT OF THE TYPE USED FOR THE LAST 30 YEARS IN MANUFACTURE OF THE SIMPLER AT-CUT CRYSTALS IS INADEQUATE FOR PRODUCTION OF SC-CUT CRYSTALS, WHICH REQUIRE PRECISE ORIENTATION ABOUT EACH OF TWO AXES (I.E., ARE \"DOUBLY ROTATED\"). THE PROPOSED PROGRAM HAS AS ITS OBJECTIVES PROOF OF FEASIBILITY OF A NOVEL X-RAY TECHNIQUE TO PERMIT BOTH MEASUREMENT AND CORRECTION OF THE ANGLES OF CUT OF DOUBLY ROTATED QUARTZ-CRYSTAL PLATES, SUCH AS THE SC, IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT, AND DELIVERY OF A CONCEPTUAL DESIGN FOR A COMPLETE ORIENTATION MEASUREMENT INSTRUMENT. FEASIBILITY WILL BE DETERMINED FROM CALCULATIONS AND FROM EXPERIMENTS UTILIZING MODIFICATIONS TO A PROTOTYPE LASER-ASSISTED LAUE DIFFRACTOMETER, AN INSTRUMENT SIMILAR IN GEOMETRY TO THAT PROPOSED.",

THE MORTALITY RATE OF ANAEROBIC INFECTIONS CAN BE VERY HIGH IF THE INFECTIOUS AGENT IS NOT IDENTIFIED AND PROPER THERAPY INITIATED. PREVIOUS TO THE MID 1970'S, IDENTIFICATION OF THE INFECTING ANAEROBE WAS SUFFICIENT FOR PROPER TREATMENT, HOWEVER WITH THE INCREASED USAGE OF THE NEWER ANTIBIOTICS, THERE HAS BEEN A SUBSEQUENT INCREASE IN ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE OF SEVERAL GROUPS OF COMMONLY ENCOUNTERED PATHOGENIC ANAEROBES. THE ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCES OBSERVED ARE NOT LIMITED TO SPECIFIC GROUPS OF ORGANISMS NOR ARE THEY LIMITED TO PARTICULAR ANTIBIOTICS. THEREFORE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING OF ANAEROBIC BACTERIA ISOLATED FROM CLINICAL MATERIAL IS NOW NECESSARY AND SHOULD BE PERFORMED ROUTINELY. THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE ON LABORATORY STANDARDS (NCCLS) RECOMMENDED PROCEDURE FOR TESTING ANTIBIOTIC SUSCEPTIBILITIES OF ANAEROBIC BACTERIA IS EXTREMELY CUMBERSOME AND ALSO HAS GROWTH PROBLEMS WITH INDIVIDUAL STRAINTS OF OXYGEN SENSITIVE ORGANISMS. SIMILARLY, THE COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITIES GIVE INCONSISTENT RESULTS AND ARE INCAPABLE OF SUPPORTING THE GROWTH OF THE MORE OXYGEN SENSITIVE AND NUTRITIONALLY FASTIDIOUS ORGANISMS. THE RESULTS FROM THESE SYSTEMS TEND TO GIVE LOWER VALUES OR FALSE SUSCEPTIBILITIES FOR CERTAIN ANTIBIOTICS AND ORGANISMS. PLANNED FOR PHASE I WILL BE THE DESIGN OF A PROCESS BY WHICH PRODUCTION AND PACKAGING OF TEST ANTIBIOTIC SUSCEPTIBILITY PANELS WILL BE DONE UNDER STRICT ANAEROBIC CONDITIONS.

WHILE NOT A DIAGNOSTIC PANACEA, THE SERUM ASSAY COULD QUICKEN DIAGNOSIS AND AID IN FOLLOW-UP ON THE PROGRESSION OR REGRESSION OF THE NEOPLASM. IN THIS PROPOSAL WE PLAN TO DEVELOP AN IMMUNOCHEMICAL ASSAY FOR HUMAN SERUM EPOXIDE HYDROLASE-PRENEOPLASTIC ANTIGEN IN ORDER TO FACILITATE STUDIES ON THIS ASSAY AS A SPECIFIC TEST FOR HEPATO-CELLULAR CARCINOMA IN HUMANS (PHASE I). THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF DEATH FROM CANCER, LIVER CANCER HAS AN ETIOLOGICALLY PREDISPOSING POPULATION OF MILLIONS WHO SUFFER FROM HEPATITIS B, CIRRHOSIS, AND OTHER CHRONIC LIVER DISEASES. BASED ON STUDIES IN FARBER'S GRIFFIN'S AND LEVIN'S LABORATORIES A PROTEIN EH-PNA (EPOXIDE HYDROLASE-PRENEOPLASTIC ANTIGEN) HAS BEEN DESCRIBED WHICH IS RELEASED FROM ITS MEMBRANOUS ENVIRONMENT SPECIALLY IN PRENEOPLASTIC AND NEOPLASTIC LIVER CELLS OF RODENTS. A SENSITIVE RADIOCHEMICAL ASSAY FOR EH-PNA DEVELOPED IN HAMMOCK'S LABORATORY (UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA) HAS NOW PROVIDED EVIDENCE THAT ELEVATED EH-PNA APPEARS IN THE SERUM OF PATIENTS WITH HEPATO-CELLULAR CARCINOMA. USING ANTIBODIES AGAINST RAT EPOXIDE HYDROLASE A RAPID ENZYME-LINKED-IMMUNOABSORBENT-ASSAY (ELISA) HAS BEEN DEVELOPED DEMONSTRATING THE APPLICABILITY OF THIS TECHNIQUE FOR MEASURING EH-PNA. THE PURPOSE OF PHASE I OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP AN IMMUNOCHEMICAL ASSAY FOR EH-PNA IN HUMAN SERUM. THIS ASSAY SHOULD BE OF PRIMARY INTEREST TO THE DIVISION OF CANCER BIOLOGY AND DIAGNOSIS, NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE. IT WILL INVOLVE WORK UNDER A LICENSING AGREEMENT ON AN INVENTION BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA (THE MEASUREMENT OF SERUM EH-PNA) FOR WHICH A PATENT APPLICATION HAS BEEN MADE. THIS WILL ALLOW A SMALL BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA TO PURSUE SPECIFIC RESEARCH THAT MAY LEAD EVENTUALLY TO THE RIGHTS FOR PRODUCTION AND MARKETING OF THE ASSAY KIT. COLLABORATION WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WILL OCCUR ON SCIENTIFIC ASPECTS OF THE ASSAY. THE SPECIFIC AIMS FOR PHASE I ARE: 1) TO ISOLATE EH-PNA FROM LIVER MICROZOMES OF A PRIMATE, 2) TO USE THE ISOLATED EH-PNA AS AN ANTIGEN TO INDUCE ANTISERA IN GOATS AND RABBITS, 3) TO MAKE THE ANTISERA (IGG FRACTION) MONO-SPECIFIC FOR EH-PNA, AND 4) TO DEVELOP AN ELISA FOR EH-PNA APPLICABLE TO HUMAN SERA.

THE ASSAY IS BASED UPON GEL FILTRATION PROCEDURES TO DETERMINE THE PARTITIONING OF SPECIFIC CONTAMINANTS OF LOW MOLECULAR WEIGHT GSH POOLS, MEDIUM MOLECULAR WEIGHT MT POOLS, AND HIGH MOLECULAR WEIGHT ENZ POOLS. BECAUSE HIGH LEVELS OF CONTAMINANTS ARE TODAY FOUND IN URBAN RECREATIONAL LAKES FROM WHICH PEOPLE CATCH AND CONSUME 100'S OF TONS OF FISH ANNUALLY, IT IS CRITICAL THAT CONTAMINANT IMPACTS UPON HUMAN HEALTH ARE DETERMINED ACCURATELY. FISH LIVER TISSUES WILL BE ANALYSED FOR BIODETOXIFICATION USING ATOMIC ABSORPTION SPECTROPHOTOMETRY, GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY, GEL FILTRATION TECHNIQUES AND HISTOPATHOLOGY EXAMINATIONS. PHASE II WILL ESTABLISH AN INDEX OF TOXICITY, ASSIMILATION CAPACITIES FOR DETOXIFICATION SYSTEMS AND ESTABLISH A BLOOD CHEMISTRY PROGRAM FOR NON-ENVASIVE ANIMAL AND HUMAN DETOXIFICATION TESTS.

IN PHASE II, THE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES WILL BE FULLY CHARACTERIZED AND THEN USED 1) AS TOOLS TO PURIFY CMV POLYPEPTIDES FOR USE AS IMMUNOGENS IN THE PRODUCTION OF POLYCLONAL MONOSPECIFIC ANTISERA, AND 2) AS POTENTIAL DIAGNOSTIC REAGENTS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE POLYCLONAL REAGENTS TO DEVELOP A SENSITIVE (POLYCLONAL), SPECIFIC (MONOCLONAL), RAPID ASSAY TO DETECT CMV SHED IN THE URINE OF INFECTED INDIVIDUALS. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT SENSITIVITY WILL HAVE TO BE GREATLY INCREASED OVER THAT OF CONVENTIONAL COLORIMETRIC ELISA'S, AND THIS WILL BE APPROACHED IN SEVERAL NOVEL WAYS BY EXAMINING OTHER ENZYMES, FLUOROGENIC SUBSTRATES, AND ALTERNATE SOLID PHASES. POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF SUCH AN ASSAY ARE GREAT, AS THIS NEED IS NOT CURRENTLY BEING MET. SUCH AN ASSAY COULD BE EXPECTED TO BE WIDELY USED IN PEDIATRIC WARDS, PRENATAL CLINICS, ONCOLOGY CHEMOTHERAPY SETTINGS, TRANSPLANTATION CLINICS, AND TRANSFUSION CENTERS. THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THE GOALS AS OUTLINED BY THE RAPID VIRAL DIAGNOSTIC PROGRAM OF THE NIAID.",

UP TO THIS TIME, DETAILED STUDIES OF CLEARANCE MECHANISMS AND PARTICULATE ACCUMULATION IN HUMAN SUBJECTS HAS NOT BEEN POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF THE EXCESSIVE RADIATION ASSOCIATED WITH EXISTING TECHNIQUES. THE RECENTLY DEVELOPED TECHNIQUE OF MAGNETOPNEUMOGRAPHY (MPG) NOW OFFERS A NON-INVASIVE, PURELY PASSIVE MEANS TO CONDUCT SUCH STUDIES. IT ALSO OFFERS THE POTENTIAL FOR ROUTINE SCREENING OF INDIVIDUALS TO MEASURE CLEARANCE TIMES AND HENCE CLASSIFY PEOPLE RELATIVE TO THEIR SUSCEPTIBILITY TO LUNG DAMAGE IN VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. ADDITIONALLY, MPG MAY BE USED TO MONITOR DUST ACCUMULATION FOR PEOPLE IN ENVIRONMENTS KNOWN TO BE HAZARDOUS OVER TIME; WHEN CRITICAL LEVELS OF PARTICULATE ACCUMULATIONS HAVE BEEN REACHED, THOSE INDIVIDUALS MAY BE REMOVED AS REQUIRED FROM THE ENVIRONMENT IN QUESTION. AN EXAMPLE OF THIS WOULD BE THE MONITORING OF COAL DUST ACCUMULATION IN COAL MINERS. THE FIRST GENERATION OF SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNETOMETERS CONSTRUCTED BY S.H.E. CORPORATION AND USED IN THE PIONEERING MPG WORK HAVE CERTAIN SERIOUS LIMITATIONS WHICH MAKE WIDESPREAD CLINICAL RESEARCH IMPRACTICAL. WE ARE HERE PROPOSING TO IDENTIFY THE SOURCES OF THOSE LIMITATIONS AND MINIMIZE OR ELIMINATE THEM.

THE PRIMARY PHASE I EFFORT WILL STUDY THE INSTRUMENT DRIFT SOURCES (FLUX MOTION IN SUPERCONDUCTING MATERIALS, MAGNETIC RELAXATION EFFECTS, ETC.) RESULTING FROM EXPOSURE TO THE DC FIELDS REQUIRED BY THE TECHNIQUE. VARIOUS NEW PICKUP COIL ARRAYS WILL BE EVALUATED TO OBTAIN IMPROVED SENSITIVITY DEEP IN THE LUNGS AND TO REDUCE MEASUREMENT TIME. UPON RESOLUTION OF THESE TWO ISSUES, A PRELIMINARY DESIGN OF A COMPLETE INSTRUMENT SUITABLE FOR EXTENSIVE CLINICAL STUDIES WILL BE PREPARED. IN PHASE II, THAT PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENT WILL BE PRODUCED AND MADE AVAILABLE FOR CLINICAL STUDIES. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THESE STUDIES WILL LEAD TO OUR COMMERCIALIZATION AND PRODUCTION OF AN MPG INSTRUMENT PACKAGE.",

THEREFORE, VISIBLE LIGHT ABSORPTION CANNOT ACCURATELY MONITOR OIL QUALITY. IT IS NECESSARY TO CONSIDER WAVELENGTHS IN THE FAR INFRA-RED REGION OF THE SPECTRUM. A SYSTEM, AND METHOD OF RESEARCH, TO USE FAR INFRA-RED RADIATION TO MONITOR SUSPENDED CARBON AND DISPERSANT FAILURE IS PROPOSED.

A KEY PROBLEM IN EVOLVING AN ELECTRODE IMPLANT TECHNOLOGY BASE IS THE ABILITY TO MAINTAIN POINT SOURCES OF BARE METAL AT THE TIP OF AN INSULATED WIRE WHICH REPRODUCIBLY DELIVERS KNOWN AMOUNTS OF ELECTRICAL STIMULATION OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME. THE PERCUTANEOUS SALINE ENVIRONMENT AND FLEXING OF THE IMPLANT SERIOUSLY DEGRADE THE ADHESION OF THE INSULATING COATING TO THE WIRE THEREBY INCREASING ELECTRODE AREA WITH CONCOMITANT FAILURE OF THE DEVICE. DURING PHASE I OF THIS PROGRAM, WE PROPOSE TO ELECTROCHEMICALLY GENERATE THIN, COHERENT POLYPHENYLENE OXIDE COATINGS ONTO PLATINUM WIRE SUBSTRATES FROM PHENOLIC MONOMERS. PREVIOUS WORK HAS SHOWN THESE COATINGS TO MANIFEST EXCELLENT ADHESION TO METALLIC SUBSTRATES DUE TO CHEMICAL BOND FORMATION BETWEEN THE SUBSTRATE AND POLYMER AS IT IS FORMED IN SITU. THE INTEGRITY OF THESE COATINGS WILL BE ASSESSED BY SEM AND ESCA. ELECTROCHEMICAL TECHNIQUES DESIGNED TO ASSESS THE COATINGS' RESISTANCE TO SALINE WILL ALSO BE APPLIED. PHASE II WORK WILL FOCUS ON IN-DEPTH CHEMICAL, ELECTROCHEMICAL, AND MECHANICAL EVALUATION OF THE OPTIMIZED COATINGS.

TORQUE MEASUREMENTS ARE UNRELIABLLE DUE TO VARIABLE FRICTION COEFFICIENTS AND OTHER MORE ACCURATE METHODS SUCH AS HYDRAULIC TENSIONERS, ULTRASONIC MEASUREMENTS, STRAIN GAUGES, AND X-RAY DIFFRACTION ARE OFTEN IMPRATICAL IN THE FIELD. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT BOLT AXIAL STRESSES, AND THEREFORE LOADS, CAN BE DETERMINED RELIABLY IN THE FIELD USING THE MAGNETOELASTIC PROPERTIES OF FERROMAGNETIC MATERIAL. WHEN A FERROMAGNETIC MATERIAL, SUCH AS A STEEL BOLT, IS SUBJECTED TO A MAGNETIZING FIELD A SERIES OF ABRUPT CHANGES IN MATERIAL MAGNETIZATIONOCCURS. THIS PHENOMENON IS KNOWN AS \"BARKHAUSEN NOISE.\" PREVIOUS TESTS HAVE CONFIRMED THAT THE BARKHAUSEN NOISE LEVEL IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE STRESS LEVEL IN THE MATERIAL WHICH IS BEING SUBJECTED TO THE MAGNETIXZING FIELD. SMALL, PORTABLE EQUIPMENT IS COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE WHICH USES THE BARKHAUSEN PRINCPLE TO DETERMINE THE RESIDUAL STRESSES IN WELD SEAMS, FORGINGS, CASTINGS, SHAFTS AND CAMS, ETC. THIS PROPOSAL IS TO MODIFY THIS COMMERCIALLY AVAILABL EQUIPMENT TO MEET THE NEED TO BOLT STRESS MEASUREMENT AND THEN TO DEMONSTRATE THAT BOLT AXIAL STRESSES AND HENCE BOLT AXIAL LOADS, CAN BE CORRELATED TO THE BARKHAUSEN NOISE LEVEL MEASURED ON THE BOLT HEAD OR IN A SMALL DIAMETER HOLE IN THE BOLT SHANK.",

THIS INVESTIGATION WILL FOCUS ON ULTRASONIC EFFECTS ON FINE PARTICLE SEPARATION OF COAL FROM ASH, PYRITE AND LIKE MINERAL MATTER AFTER GRINDING. COAL ORGANIC MATTER, INCLUDING SULFUR CONTAINING ORGANICS, HAS A SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF LESS THAN ABOUT 1.6. CLAYS AND MINERALS FROM OVERBURDEN HAVE SPECIFIC GRAVITIES BETWEEN 2.4 - 2.8, WHILE THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF PYRITE IS ABOUT 5.0. HENCE, CONVENTIONAL COAL CLEANING PLANTS USE SPECIFIC GRAVITY TO EFFECT REMOVAL OF CLAYS AND PYRITE. MANY COALS CONTAIN PYRITE AND MINERALS WHICH ARE OF SMALL PARTICLE SIZE AND WIDELY DISPERSED. SPECIFIC GRAVITY WILL NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN REMOVING WIDELY DISPERSED PYRITE. THE CYCLIC VIBRATORY MOTION OF A PNEUMATIC MEDIUM INFLUENCES SUSPENDED DISCRETE PARTICLES TO A VARYING EXTENT. AT ONE EXTREME, WHEN THE PARTICLES ARE VERY SMALL AND/OR THE FREQUENCY IS LOW, THE PARTICLES VIBRATE IN PHASE WITH THE MEDIUM AND AT THE SAME AMPLITUDE. AT THE OTHER EXTREME, WHEN THE PARTICLES ARE VERY LARGE AND/OR THE FREQUENCY IS HIGH THE PARTICLES REMAIN STATIONARY. AS THE FREQUENCY IS INCREASED, THE LARGEST PARTICLES ARE THE FIRST TO LAG BEHIND THE VIBRATION OF THE MEDIUM AND, FINALLY, TO STOP VIBRATING. INCREASE OF FREQUENCY FURTHER LIMITS THE SIZE OF PARTICLES RESPONDING, THE SQUARE OF THE LIMITING PARTICLE DIAMETER BEING INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO THE FREQUENCY. IN THIS PROJECT, ULTRASONIC EFFECTS ON ENTRAINMENT AND SEDIMENTATION AS A FUNCTION OF PARTICLE SIZE, DENSITY AND SHAPE WILL BE ANALYZED. AFTER FINE GRINDING COAL PARTICLES REMAIN MORE EQUIAXED THAN ASH CONTENTS WHICH ASSUME A PLATE-LIKE SHAPE. WHEN INTRODUCED INTO A GAS STREAM IN A TUBULAR REACTOR AND EXPOSED TO ULTRASONIC STANDING WAVES THESE DISSIMILAR PARTICLES WILL SEPARATE BECAUSE OF DIFFERING SIZE, DENSITY AND SHAPE THUS ENABLING EASY COLLECTION. THE TWO PRODUCTS WILL THEN BE ANALYZED BY EXISTING METHODS SUCH AS WASHABILITY AND SUBSEQUENT PROXIMATE ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE SEPARATION EFFICIENCY OF THE TECHNIQUE. THE PHASE I FEASIBILITY DEMONSTRATION SHOULD PROVIDE THE NECESSARY ENGINEERING DATA FOR FURTHER PHASE II AND III DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTION ARRAYS.",

THE CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT WILL UTILIZE AN INTEGRATED MULTI-ELEMENT AIRFOIL SYSTEM TO BE DESIGNED TO FORM A SLOT BETWEEN THE UPPER AND LOWER SURFACE IN THE TURBULENT RECOVERY REGIONS. THIS SLOT BRINGS HIGHER ENERGY AIR FROM THE LOWER SURFACE TO RE-ENERGIZE THE TURBULENT BOUNDARY LAYER ON THE UPPER SURFACE. ALSO BECAUSE OF THE INTERACTION OF THE ELEMENTS FORMED BY THIS SLOT, THERE ARE ADDED BENEFITS IN REDUCING THE ONSET OF TURBULENT BOUNDARY LAYER SEPARATION. THE PRESSURE AT THE TRAILING EDGE OF THE MAIN ELEMENT IS REDUCED WHILE THE MAXIMUM VELOCITIES ON THE FLAP ARE REDUCED. BOTH THESE EFFECTS REDUCE THE TOTAL PRESSURE RISE IN THE RECOVERY REGIONS. THIS NEW NLF AIRFOIL IS TO BE DEVELOPED ITERATIVELY, BASED ON THE VIKEN-PFENNINGER NLF (1)-0414F AIRFOIL WITH 70% CHORD LAMINAR FLOW; USING POTENTIAL FLOW, BOUNDARY LAYER, AND LAMINAR FLOW STABILITY COMPUTER CODES. EMPHASIS WILL BE MADE TO GET EXTENSIVE LAMINAR FLOW FOR AS WIDE A LIFT RANGE AS POSSIBLE AND TO GET ACCEPTABLE ACCELERATION THRUGH THE SLOT AT NOT ONLY THE HIGH CLIMB LIFT COEFFICIENTS BUT ALSO AT THE LOW CRUISE LIFT COEFFICIENTS WHEN THERE IS VERY LITTLE PRESSURE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SURFACES.

THIS METHOD PERMITS WIDE FLEXIBILITY IN THE STRUCTURAL FEATURES OF THE MEMBRANE. WE HAVE PREPARED MEMBRANES WITH BOTH ISOLATED AND VICINAL CARBOXYLIC ACID FUNCTIONS BY THIS METHOD.

KNOWLEDGE OF PHYSICAL/OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF ATMOSPHERIC ATMOSPHERIC AEROSOLS WILL GREATLY ENHANCE THE CAPABILITY OF MODELING ATMOSPHERIC TRANSMISSION AND PREDICTING PERFORMANCE OF OPTICAL AND INFRAFED SYSTEMS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PHASE I EFFORTS ARE TO IDENTIFY THE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS, INVESTIGATE THE TECHNICAL FEASI BILITY OF THE DEVELOPED CONCEPT AND DESIGN A PROTOTYPE SYSTEM INCLUDING A PARTICLE (INLET) SAMPLING SYSTEM FOR POTENTIAL AIRCRAFT USAGE, IDENTIFY LIGHT SOURCE, OPTICS AND DETECTORS FOR THE SYSTEM, AND A DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEM. THE PROPOSED APPROCH IS TO MEASURE THE SPECTRAL AND ANGULAR VARIATION OF SCATTERED LIGHT PATTERNS OF INDIVIDUAL PARTICLES OVER 4 STERADIANS BY EMPLOYING MULTIPLE SOURCES AND DETECTORS AND A FAST RESPONSE DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEM. PHASE I RESULTS ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE DETAILS OF SYSTEM DESIGN, HARDWARE IDENTIFICATION AND THEORETICAL ANALYSIS THAT WILL DIRECT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PHASE II - THE ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION OF THE SYSTEM.",

IF THE SPREAD OF RESISTANT STRAINS IS NOT ADEQUATELY CONTROLLED, THIS FAILURE WILL BE REFLECTED IN HIGHER INCIDENCES OF DISEASE AND INCREASED COSTS OF TREATMENT WITH ALTERNATIVE ANTIBIOTICS. ONE IMPROVEMENT IN THE METHODS FOR CONTROL WOULD BE TO PROVIDE A MEANS OF MORE RAPID BACTERIAL DETECTION AND IDENTIFICATION OF RESISTANCE FACTORS. THIS METHOD MUST BE FASTER THAN THE 2-4 DAYS NECESSARY FOR CULTURE-DEPENDENT TECHNIQUES BUT POSSESS A SIMILAR DEGREE OF ACCURACY AND SENSITIVITY.

FOR THIS PURPOSE, WE WILL UTILIZE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES DIRECTED AGAINST TWO \"FUNCTIONAL\" TARGETS. THE FIRST WILL PROVIDE THE PHYLOGENETIC IDENTIFICATION OF THE BACTERIA (I.E., ANTIBODIES TO MEMBRANE PROTEINS OR LPS), AND THE SECOND WILL IDENTIFY THE SPECIFIC PLASMID-ENCODED RESISTANCE FACTOR (I.E., ANTIBODY TO BETA-LACTAMASE).

MULTIPLEX GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY OFFERS A TECHNIQUE FOR TECHNIQUE FOR CONTINUOUS REAL-TIME ANALYSIS, AND AT THE SAME TIME THE POTENTIAL FOR INCREASED SENSITIVITY, BOTH HIGHLY ADVANTAGEOUS.

A COMPUTER CONNECTED TO AN ELECTRONIC INTERROGATOR COMMUNICATES WITH THE LABELED ITEMS AND IDENTIFIES THEIR LOCATION. THE ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY OF THIS SYSTEM IS BASED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF LOW COST COMPUTER EQUIPMENT AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PASSIVE (BATTERY-LESS), LOW COST, CMOS CHIP FOR THE LABELS. PHASE I WILL INVOLVE THE PROTOTYPE DEVELOPMENT, AND EXPERIMENTATION OF THE CRITICAL ELEMENTS OF THIS TECHNOLOGY, NAMELY, THE CHIP, THE INTERROGATOR AND THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THEM. IN PHASE II, THE ENTIRE SYSTEM WILL BE DEVELOPED INCLUDING THE INTERROGATOR-TO-COMPUTER INTERFACE AND THE COMPUTER SOFTWARE. THE HEALTH RELATED APPLICATIONS INCLUDE MAINTENANCE OF MISPLACED PATIENT-CARE DOCUMENTS. FUTURE APPLICATIONS OF THIS TECHNOLOGY CAN INCLUDE DRUG INVENTORY CONTROL, LABORATORY SPECIMEN IDENTIFICATION, AND ENTRANCE/EXIT CONTROL FOR AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL.",

COLON AND RECTAL CANCER HAS SURPASSED LUNG CANCER AS THE NUMBER ONE CANCER KILLER IN THE UNITED STATES. MOST INVESTIGATORS FEEL THAT OCCULT BLEEDING IS THE MOST FREQUENT CONSEQUENCE AND MOST PREDICTIVE INDICATOR OF THE PRESENCE OF TUMOR. THE HIGH MORTALITY RATE OF NEAR 60% MAKES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A DIAGNOSTIC TEST FOR THIS CANCER OF EXTREME IMPORTANCE SINCE EARLY DETECTION IS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH CURE RATES. A NUMBER OF TESTS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO DETECT OCCULT HEMAGLOBIN IN STOOLS. THESE INCLUDE THE DILUTE TINCTURE OF GUAIAC, SATURATED GUAIAC, HEMASTAT, AND HEMOCCULT TEST. IN ADDITION, THE PUNCH-DISC RADIAL IMMUNODIFFUSION TECHNIQUE HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AND HAS DEMONSTRATED GREATER SENSITIVITY THAN THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED TESTS AS WELL AS A DEGREE OF SPECIFICITY NOT FOUND IN THE PREVIOUS TESTS. WE WILL DEVELOP A PUNCH-DISC ENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY (ELISA) FOR THE DETECTION OF OCCULT HEMAGLOBIN IN STOOLS. THE SENSITIVITY OF THE ASSAY SHOULD BE CLEARLY SUPERIOR TO THAT OF EXISTING TESTS. BECAUSE OF ITS GREATER SENSITIVITY, THE PUNCH-DISC ELISA WILL ALLOW DETECTION OF HEMAGLOBIN ANTIGENS AT AN EARLIER STAGE OF COLON CANCER DEVELOPMENT THAN THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED TESTS. AN INCREASED SURVIVOR RATE SHOULD RESULT FROM THE EARLIER DETECTION OF COLON CANCER. THIS NEWLY DEVELOPED PUNCH-DISC ELISA WILL BE EVALUATED CRITICALLY IN TERMS OF STANDARDIZATION, SENSITIVITY, SPECIFICITY, AND REPRODUCIBILITY. THESE CHARACTERISTICS ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE QUALITY CONTROL OF THE ASSAY. THE FINDINGS IN PHASE I OF THIS STUDY WILL BE USED TO PLAN THE DEMONSTRATION IN PHASE II OF THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THE PUNCH-DISC ELISA AS A DIAGNOSTIC TECHNIQUE FOR THE EARLY DETECTION OF COLON CANCER AND OTHER CAUSES OF ALIMENTARY TRACT BLEEDING. THE DETECTION OF BLEEDING FROM NONCANCEROUS LESIONS COULD BE AN IMPORTANT AID IN THE CURE-RATE OF THESE LESIONS. THE PUNCH-DISC ELISA IS A SPECIFIC, SENSITIVE, ACCURATE, AND SIMPLE SCREENING PROCEDURE THAT CAN BE OF SIGNIFICANT VALUE TO PRACTIONERS, CLINICS, AND OTHER LABORATORIES AS A QUANTITATIVE ASSAY CAPABLE OF DETECTING HEMAGLOBIN ANTIGEN IN THE NANNOGRAM RANGE.

THIS SEARCH HAS LED TO THE DISCOVERY OF SEVERAL OTHER CARCINOFETAL PROTEINS SUCH AS VARIENTS OF CEA AND ALPHA FETOPROTEINS. THE TUMOR MARKER, TENNESSEE ANTIGEN, APPEARS TO DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM CEA IN MOLECULAR WEIGHT, MOBILITY IN IMMUNOELECTROPHORESIS, CARBOHYDRATE RESIDUE CONTENTS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IN ANTIGENICITY. THE CLINICAL EVALUATION OF THE ANTIGEN HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED USING A HEMAGGLUTINATION INHIBITION ASSAY (TENNAGEN ASSAY). THE STATISTICAL EVALUATION OF 7300 ASSAYS HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED AND APPEARS TO BE VERY PROMISING IN COLORECTAL AND LUNG CANCERS. THE REFINEMENT OF MEASUREMENT OF LEVELS OF TENNESSEE ANTIGEN USING THE ENZYME IMMUNOASSAY METHODOLOGY WILL INCREASE THE MARKER'S USE IN MONITORING CLINICAL COURSES OF TREATMENT. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO UTILIZE AVAILABLE TENNESSEE ANTIGEN AND ANTIBODY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ENZYME IMMUNOASSAY AND TO EVALUATE THE SENSITIVITY AND VALUE OF THE MARKER WHEN USING A MORE SENSITIVE METHODOLOGY THAN HEMAGGLUTINATION INHIBITION. THE ENZYME IMMUNOASSAY WILL ALLOW EXPANSION OF THE SCALE OF VALUES SO THAT ONE WOULD HAVE A GREATER DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN A NEGATIVE RANGE AND A POSITIVE RANGE AS COMPARED TO THE RANGE ALLOWED BY THE HEMAGGLUTINATION INHIBITION ASSAY. THE READABILITY OF THE ASSAY BY ELECTRONIC APPARATUS WILL BE MORE RELIABLE AND CONSISTENT BETWEEN USERS THAN THE HEMAGGLUTINATION INHIBITION ASSAY WHICH RELIES ON VISUAL INTERPRETATION.",

THE VORTEX SHED FREQUENCY IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE AIR VELOCITY AND WITH A SMALL VORTEX ROD SIZE, VORTEX FREQUENCIES OF SEVERAL THOUSAND PER SECOND ARE OBTAINED. SINCE EACH VORTEX IS AN INDEPENDENT MEASURE OF THE AIRSPEED DURING ITS FORMATION,RESPONSE TIMES OF LESS THAN ONE MILLISECOND CAN BE OBTAIN. THE WIND VECTORS WILL BE SEPARATED INTO TWO COMPONENTS AND EACH COMPONENT MEASURED. THE VORTICES ARE DETECTED USING AN ULTRASONIC IMAGING TECHNIQUE. INSTRUMENTS USING THIS TECHNIQUE HAVE BEEN TEST FLOWN ON HELICOPTERS AS AIRSPEED AND DIRECTION SENSORS. HOWEVER, IN THOSE APPLICATIONS, RESPONSE TIMES WERE NOT CRITICAL. THE SAME SENSING TECHNIQUE HAS BEEN USED IN AUTOMOBILE AIR INTAKE SENSORS WHERE RESPONSE TIMES OF LESS THAN 10 MILLISECONDS WERE MEASURED.

THE LIE DETECTOR FOR 0 G CONSISTS OF A PHOTODETECTOR AND A TUNABLE, PULSED LASER OPERATING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF 1.9UM, THE WAVELENGTH REQUIRED FOR EXCITATION OF THE G G ELECTRONIC TRANSITION IN 0 . THE NARROW BANDWIDTH OF THE LASER WILL ALLOW SELECTIVE EXCITATION OF ROTATIONAL STATES IN THE V = O OR V = 1 LEVEL OF 0 G. EMISSION FROM THE G G TRANSITION, MODULATED BY THE 10 HZ LASER, WILL BE SYNCHRONOUSLY DETECTED. IN PHASE I, THE TUNABLE LASER WILL BE CONSTRUCTED AND THE SENSITIVITY OF LIE DETECTION FOR O G WILL BE EVALUATED.",

PADS HAVE MULTIPLE POTENTIAL USES AND HAVE BEEN STUDIED EXTENSIVELY IN RELATION TO PERMANENTLY IMPLANTED PROSTHESES THAT AUGMENT THE ACTION OF THE FAILING HEART. PRESENT CARDIAC ASSIST SYSTEMS DEPEND ON ELECTRICAL OR PNEUMATIC POWER, WHICH MUST BE TRANSMITTED ACROSS OR THROUGH THE SKIN. AS YET, HOWEVER, A PAD THAT IS RELIABLE IN LONG-TERM USE HAS NOT BEEN DEVELOPED. TO PREVENT INFECTION, THE MAJOR CAUSE OF PAD FAILURE, WE POSTULATE THAT PAD DESIGN MUST PROVIDE FOR (1) CONTROL OF EPIDERMAL PROLIFERATION AND MIGRATION IN PROXIMITY TO THE IMPLANT, AND (2) ATTENUATION OF LOCAL STRAIN. A PAD HYPOTHESIZED TO MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS IS BEING STUDIED IN RATS AND SWINE. ITS NECK (THE TRANSCUTANEOUS PORTION) IS NANOPOROUS; A DACRON VELOUR-COVERED FLANGE JOINED TO THE NECK IS PLACED SUBDERMALLY. PRIOR TO IMPLANTATION, AUTOLOGOUS FIBROBLASTS ARE CULTURED ONTO THE PAD NECK, FORMING A MULTILAYER COATING. THE RESULTS TO DATE INDICATE THAT PADS PREPARED IN THIS WAY INHIBIT EPITHELIAL DOWNGROWTH, WHEREAS UNCOATED IMPLANTS FAIL AS A RESULT OF EPIDERMAL MIGRATION AND INFECTION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PHASE I PROJECT IS TO TRANSFER AND EXTEND TO SHEEP (WHICH INCREASINGLY ARE USED FOR FULL-SCALE TESTING OF CARDIAC ASSIST SYSTEMS) THE METHODS EVOLVED IN SWINE. SPECIFIC AIMS ARE: (1) TO ADAPT TECHNIQUES FOR IN VITRO FIBROBLAST PROLIFERATION AND COLLAGEN PRODUCTION ON THE PAD NECK TO SHEEP CELLS; (2) TO ADAPT SURGICAL TECHNIQUES FOR PAD IMPLANTATION TO SHEEP; AND (3) TO DEVELOP A PROTOCOL FOR LONG-TERM EVALUATION IN SHEEP OF A FUNCTIONING PAD TRANSFERRING POWER TO AN IMPLANTED HEART ASSIST DEVICE. THE LONG-RANGE GOAL IS TO QUALIFY A PAD AND MAKE IT COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE FOR CLINICAL USE IN CONJUNCTION WITH A SYSTEM FOR TREATMENT OF PATIENTS IN SEVERE, CHRONIC LEFT HEART FAILURE. IN ADDITION, AVAILABILITY OF THE PAD FOR SHEEP WILL FACILITATE ITS FOR PRECLINICAL EVALUATION OF VARIOUS MECHANICAL HEART ASSIST SYSTEMS BY OTHERS. THIS PROGRAM WILL ALSO LEAD TO IMPROVED PADS FOR OTHER COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS SUCH AS VASCULAR ACCESS FOR KIDNEY DIALYSIS AND SKELETAL ATTACHMENT OF PROSTHETIC LIMBS.",

CURRENTLY CELL MARKER ANALYSIS, PROVEN TO BE CLINICALLY IMPORTANT IN THE DETECTION, DIAGNOSIS AND MONITORING OF HUMAN DISEASES, ARE PERFORMED EITHER MANUALLY VIA FLUORESCENT/LIGHT MICROSCOPY (IMPRECISE IDENTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL COUNTING ERRORS) OR BY FLOW CYTOMETRIC ANALYSIS (COSTLY CAPITAL EQUIPMENT OUTLAY). THE COMMERCIAL AVAILABILITY OF EASILY VISUALIZED, NONFLUORESCENT MONOCLONAL REAGENTS WILL PERMIT CLINICAL HOSPITAL LABORATORIES TO PERFORM CELL MARKER STUDIES ON ALREADY EXISTENT CAPITAL EQUIPMENT, IMAGE ANALYSIS SYSTEMS, WHICH PERFORM ROUTINE BLOOD CELL DIFFERENTIALS IN MANY LABS. THESE IMAGE ANALYSIS SYSTEMS ARE NOT CAPABLE OF FLUORESCENCE DETECTION WHICH NEGATES THEIR UTILIZATION WITH EXISTENT FLUORESCENT MONOCLONALS. ONE ASPECT OF THIS PROJECT WILL INVOLVE THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH NONFLUORESCENT HEAVY METAL COLLOID TAGS WHICH BECAUSE OF THEIR VARIABLE SIZE AND COLOR DIFFERENCES MAY BE USED IN COMBINATION RESULTING IN SAVINGS TO THE CUSTOMER. THESE WILL BE COUPLED TO A VARIETY OF COMMONLY USED AND SPECIALIZED MONOCLONAL REAGENTS AGAINST HUMAN LEUKOCYTES. THIS TECHNIQUE WILL PERMIT DIRECT VISUALIZATION OF THE CELLULAR ELEMENTS SPREAD IN A MONOLAYER OR THIN SECTION MANNER ON STANDARD MICROSCOPIC SLIDES. THIS WILL PERMIT INSTANT CYTOMORPHOLOGIC CORRELATION WITH THE CELL IN QUESTION. ALL NEW REAGENTS DEVELOPED WILL BE EVALUATED BY MANUAL AND FLOW CYTOMETRIC METHODOLOGIES IN A DOUBLE BIND TEST. ONCE DEVELOPED THE REAGENTS WILL BE MARKETED FOR CELL MARKER ANALYSIS USING DIRECT VISUAL ASSESSMENT (MANUAL AND/OR IMAGE ANALYSIS SYSTEMS) AS REAGENTS OR IN KIT FORM FOR USE IN THE ROUTINE CLINICAL LABORATORY.

        "abstract": "THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP SIMPLE AND RELIABLE BIOCHEMICAL TESTS WHICH CAN BE USED TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS AT RISK FOR ALCOHOLISM, AND/OR TO ACCURATELY INDICATE RECENT ALCOHOL ABUSE. IN PHASE I, THE FEASIBILITY OF USING PLATELET ENZYMES AS SUCH MARKERS WILL BE ASSESSED. OUR PRELIMINARY STUDIES HAVE INDICATED THAT CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF PLATELET MONOAMINE OXIDASE (MAO) ACTIVITY (I.E., SENSITIVITY TO INHIBITION BY ETHANOL) AND ADENYLATE CYCLASE (AC) ACTIVITY ARE ALTERED IN ALCOHOLICS AS COMPARED TO CONTROLS. IN THE PROPOSED STUDIES, WE WILL CONFIRM THE DIFFERENCES IN A LARGER POPULATION AND DEVELOP RELIABLE METHODS FOR PLATELET PREPARATION AND ENZYME ASSAY WHICH WILL ACCENTUATE THESE DIFFERENCES. WE WILL ALSO EXAMINE ENZYME ACTIVITIES IN PLATELETS OBTAINED FROM ALCOHOLICS WHO HAVE ABSTAINED FROM ALCOHOL FOR VARIOUS LENGTHS OF TIME, IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER OBSERVED CHANGES IN PLATELET ENZYME ACTIVITIES RESULT FROM EXPOSURE TO ETHANOL, OR ARE INDICATIVE OF GENETICALLY-DETERMINED DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ALCOHOLICS AND CONTROL SUBJECTS. IN PHASE II, OUR CHOSEN ASSAY METHODS FOR MAO AND AC ACTIVITY WILL BE STREAMLINED FOR CLINICAL USE. THE REVERSIBILITY OF ENZYME CHANGES WILL BE FURTHER ASSESSED, AND ENZYME ACTIVITIES IN OTHER PSYCHIATRIC POPULATIONS (E.G., SCHIZOPHRENICS, OR PATIENTS WITH AFFECTIVE DISORDERS), AS WELL AS IN FEMALE ALCOHOLICS, WILL BE EXAMINED TO DETERMINE THE SPECIFICITY OF THESE TESTS FOR ALCOHOLISM OR ALCOHOL ABUSE. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SIMPLE AND RELIABLE TESTS FOR DIAGNOSING PAST ALCOHOL ABUSE OR A PREDISPOSITION TO ABUSE ALCOHOL WILL PROVIDE FOR THE PHYSICIAN: 1) A MEANS OF ASCERTAINING AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO MAJOR PATHOLOGIC CONDITIONS; 2) A MEANS OF ASSESSING PATIENT COMPLIANCE WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO TERMINATE ALCOHOL INTAKE; AND, 3) A POSSIBLE MEANS OF IDENTIFYING INDIVIDUALS AT RISK FOR DEVELOPING PROBLEMS WITH ALCOHOL IN THE FUTURE. EARLY IDENTIFICATION CAN ALLOW FOR EARLIER AND MORE EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION IN THE PATHOLOGY OF ALCOHOLISM.",

DNA HYBRIDIZATION HAS PROVEN HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AS A RESEARCH DIAGNOSTIC TOOL; HOWEVER, CONVENTIONAL DNA HYBRIDIZATION PROBES ARE EXPENSIVE TO COMMERCIALIZE, SINCE THEY DEPEND ON ENZYMATICALLY MODIFIED CLONED DNA. SYNTHETIC DNAS COMPLEMENTARY TO KNOWN SEQUENCES ARE RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE TO PRODUCE. THESE PROBES HYBRIDIZE RAPIDLY TO SPECIFIC SEQUENCES IN DNA OR RNA AND ARE MORE SENSITIVE TO MUTATIONS AND STRAIN DIFFERENCES THAN CLONED PROBES. OUR GOAL IS TO DEVELOP AN OLIGONUCLEOTIDE-BASED TEST TO DETECT HEPATITIS B VIRUS B VIRUS (HBV), THE INTEGRATED FORM OF WHICH IS ASSOCIATED WITH HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA. PHASE I INVOLVES THE SYNTHESIS AND TESTING OF NORMAL AND MODIFIED-OLIGONUCLEOTIDES COMPLEMENTARY TO EITHER THE HBV SURFACE ANTIGEN OR CORE ANTIGEN GENES. PHASE I WILL COMPARE THE SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY OF OLIGOMER AND CLONED PROBES FOR FILTER-BOUND HBV SEQUENCES. PHASE II WILL REFINE THE USE OF ISOTOPIC AND NON-ISOTOPIC PROBES TO DETECT HBV IN CLINICAL SAMPLES IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS AT RISK FOR CANCER.

THERE ARE SCATTERED REFERENCES FROM THE PUBLISHED LITERATURE SUGGESTING THESE IMPROVEMENTS. APPROXIMATELY 20 NEW TRIVALENT ANTIMONY COMPOUNDS WILL BE PREPARED.

THE SECOND AIM IS TO DEVELOP COMPUTER SOFTWARE THAT WILL RELATE THE MEASURED CLINICAL AND METABOLIC RESPONSES OBSERVED IN PATIENTS AND VISUALLY DISPLAY THIS INFORMATION FOR THE PHYSICIAN PRESCRIBING NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT. THE THIRD AIM IS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT A DAILY REVIEW OF THE METABOLIC RESPONSE OF PATIENTS TO NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT WILL OPTIMIZE THE CONSUMPTION OF PARENERAL SOLUTIONS AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF PATIENT CARE. THESE GOALS WILL BE ACHIEVED BY MEASURING PROTEIN BALANCES (URINE COLLECTIONS, INTAKES, LOSSES, AND CHANGE IN BODY ACCUMULATION OF UREA) ON NUTRITIONALLY SUPPORTED PATIENTS TO VALIDATE PROTEIN BALANCE ESTIMATES. THESE ESTIMATES USE A SINGLE POOL MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF UREA NITROGEN AND BUN AND SERUM CREATININE TO CALCULATE RENAL CLEARANCE, RATES OF UREA PRODUCTION, AND PCR. THIS MODEL HAS BEEN VALIDATED IN RENAL PATIENTS. ALSO PROPOSED IS A USAGE ANALYSIS OF PARENTERAL SOLUTIONS AND PRESCRIPTION OF NUTRITIONAL ASSESSMENT BY DETERMINATION OF PHARMACY DISBURSMENTS AND REVIEW OF PATIENT CHARTS. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT GOOD CORRELATION BETWEEN ESTIMATED AND MEASURED PROTEIN BALANCES WILL RESULT AND THAT THESE DATA WHEN AVAILABLE TO THE PHYSICIAN WILL IMPROVE HIS NUTRITIONAL PRESCRIPTION WITH RESPECT TO THE PATIENT'S RESPONSE TO IT. THE RESULTS OF PHASE I WILL PROVIDE THE CRITERIA FOR DESIGNING COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE DURING PHASE II.

ITS INTENDED USE IS TO SEND THESE X-RAY IMAGES FROM REMOTE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WHERE RADIOLOGISTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO CENTRALLY LOCATED FACILITIES WHERE THEY ARE AVAILABLE, SO TIMELY READING CAN BE OBTAINED. DIAGNOSTIC IMAGE ASSESSMENT IS A MAJOR RESEARCH COMPONENT BECAUSE TRANSMITTED IMAGES MUST BE SUFFICIENTLY FAITHFUL TO THE ORIGINAL RADIOGRAPH TO SUPPORT NORMAL RADIOLOGICAL PRACTICE AT REMOTE FACILITIES.

CURRENT TECHNIQUES USE ADIABATIC VENTING CODES AND A DECOUPLED HEATING ANALYSIS. THE HIGH AREA AND LARGE MASS OF SURROUNDING STRUCTURE INVALIDATES THIS APPROACH AND PRODUCES OVER CONSERVATIVE HEATING PREDICTIONS. THIS RESULTS IN UNNECESSARY AND COSTLY INTERNAL THERMAL PROTECTION MATERIALS TO BE APPLIED AND TPS CLOSEOUT REQUIREMENTS.

DETECTABILITY OF THIS TECHNIQUE IS AT THE PPM TO SUB-PPM LEVEL, WITH A TIME RESPONSE OF A SECOND OR LESS. IN ADDITION, THE DEVICE WOULD BE RUGGED AND MODERATE IN COST, AND IT COULD ALSO BE READILY DESIGNED TO MEASURE ADDITIOAL ATOMIC SPECIES WHICH INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF OTHER AGENTS OR CONTAMINANTS. THE PHASE I OBJECTIV IS THE PROOF OF PRINCIPAL EXPERIEMENT TO DEMONSTRATE TRACE CHEMICAL AGENT DETECTION IN AIR USING NON-TOXIC SIMULANTS. IN PHASE II, A FLEXIBLE BRASSBOARD APPARATUS WOULD BE BUILT, MEASUEMENTS WOULD BE MADE WITH CHEIMICAL AGENT SIMULANTS, AND A PROTOTYPE DEVICE WILL BE DESIGNED.",

THE RECENTLY DEVELOPED TECHNIQUE OF ULTRASONIC TOMOGRAPHY CAN PROVIDE A TWO-DIMENSIONAL MEASUREMENT OF THE ULTRASONIC VECTOR VELOCITY DISTRIBUTION IN A PLANE DEFINED BY A RING OF TRANSDUCERS ENCLOSING THE FLOW. THE TIME-OF-FLIGHT (TOF) IN THE PLANE OF INTEREST IS MEASURED ALONG ALL POSSIBLE PATHS AND INVERTED BY A COMPUTER TO FORM THE VELOCITY MAP. BY PLACING A SECOND RING OF TRANSDUCERS DOWNSTREAM FROM THE FIRST RING, AND MEASURING THE TOF BETWEEN ALL TRANSDUCER PAIRS, IT IS POSSIBLE TO RECONSTRUCT THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL VECTOR VELOCITY FIELD IN A MOVING FLUID. FURTHERMORE, IT IS POSSIBLE TO SEPARATE THE INTRINSIC LOCAL PROPAGATION VELOCITY FROM THE VECTOR VELOCITY OF THE FLUID. SINCE THE LOCAL VELOCITY CAN BE RELATED TO FLUID DENSITY, IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO CALCULATE MASS FLOW ON A LOCAL AS WELL AS GLOBAL BASIS. INCLUSION OF CONSTRAINTS SUCH AS CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, MOMENTUM, MASS AND CONTINUITY PROVIDE MEANS FOR INCREASING THE ACCURACY OF SUCH RECONSTRUCTIONS. IF THE FLUID IS KNOWN TO BE HOMOGENEOUS, ANY VARIATION IN LOCAL SPEED OF SOUND MAY BE RELATED TO TEMPERATURE.

THE ULTIMATE MECHANCIAL PROPERTIES OF THESE COMPACTED PARTS DEPENDS CRITICALLY ON THE OXIDE SKIN OF THE POWDERS AS OBTAINED FROM DIRECT POWDER QUENCHING OR GRINDING OF RAPIDLY SOLIDIFIED RIBBON MATERIAL. THE BRITTLE OR DUCTILE PROPERTIES OF THE OXIDE WILL DETERMINE HOW WELL IT CAN BE BROKEN UP EITHER THROUGH MECHANICAL ATTRITION OR WHEN THE POWDER UNDERGOES HOT SHEAR CONSOLIDATION. MAXIMUM DESTRUCTION OF THE OXIDES IS IMPORTANT PRIOR TO OR DURING THE COMPACTING OF THE POWDERS. THIS EFFECT CAN OCCUR THROUGH A CRUMBLING ACTION OF THE OXIDE SKIN AND DIRECT INCORPORATION OF THE PARTICULATES INTO THE COMPACTED ALLOY THEREBY ADDING PARTICULATE DISPERSANT STRENGTHENING. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP MECHANICA, CHEMICAL, AND/OR PHYSICAL METHODS FOR TREATING THE OXIDE IN ORDER TO MODIFY ITS DUCTIBILITY PROPERTIES. THIS WILL INITIALLY BE APPROACHED BY DEVELOPING METHODS FOR EVALUATING AND ANALYZING THE OXIDE SKINS. THE RESULTS OF THIS WORK WOULD HOPEFULLY LEAD TO A MODIFIED VERSION OF DEGASSING BY HEAT TREATMENT RESULTING IN A LESS ADVERSE EFFECT ON SECOND PHASE DISPERSANTS IN THE RAPIDLY SOLIDIFIED MATERIALS.",

HOWEVER, THERE IS LITTLE EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE WHICH CONFIRMS THAT LIPOSOMES ACTUALLY TARGET CHEMOTHERAPY TO SOLID TUMORS. THE OVERALL GOALS OF THIS SBIR PROJECT ARE: 1) TO VERIFY THAT SMALL VESICLES WITH COMPOSITIONS WHICH ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THEIR STABILITY, CAN BE LOADED WITH SELECTED ANTITUMOR DRUGS, 2) TO PROVE THAT SUCH DRUG LOADED LIPOSOMES CAN INCREASE DRUG UPTAKE IN EXPERIMENTAL TUMORS WHILE DECREASING THE LEVEL OF DRUG IN CRITICAL NORMAL TISSUES, AND 3) TO ESTABLISH THAT SUCH VESICLE TARGETING OF CHEMOTHERAPY CAN INCREASE ANTITUMOR EFFICACY WHILE DECREASING THE TOXIC SIDE EFFECTS. DURING PHASE I, VESICLE FORMULATIONS PREPARED FROM PURE PHOSPHOLIPIDS AND CHOLESTEROL WILL BE LOADED WITH DOXORUBICIN, A DRUG WITH CARDIOTOXIC SIDE EFFECTS. DRUG LOADED LIPOSOMES AND UNENCAPSULATED DOXORUBICIN WILL BE INJECTED INTRAVENOUSLY INTO SEPARATE SETS OF MICE BEARING SOLID LEWIS LUNG CARCINOMA TUMORS. AT VARIOUS TIMES AFTER INJECTION, BLOOD, TUMOR, AND HEART TISSUE WILL BE REMOVED AND EXTRACTED WITH 10 M UREA, AND THE EXTRACT WILL BE ANALYZED FOR DOXORUBICIN. A HIGH PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY APPARATUS WITH A SENSITIVE FLUORESCENCE DETECTOR WILL BE USED TO SEPARATE THE PARENT DRUG FROM ITS METABOLITES. QUANTITATIVE DATA ON THE DRUG CONCENTRATIONS IN EACH TISSUE WILL BE OBTAINED. BASED ON PREVIOUS RESULTS WITH VESICLE ENCAPSULATED RADIOISOTOPE, TUMOR UPTAKE OF VESICLE ENCAPSULATED DRUG IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE, COMPARED TO CONCENTRATIONS ATTAINED WITH FREE DRUG. A TWO-FOLD OR GREATER INCREASE IN TUMOR DRUG EXPOSURE IS THOUGHT TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT THERAPEUTIC IMPLICATIONS. THUS, IF SUCH AN INCREASE IS OBSERVED, PHASE II OF THE PROJECT, TESTING TOXICOLOGY AND THERAPY OF VESICLE ENCAPSULATED DOXORUBICIN WILL BE INITIATED. THE RECOGNITION THAT ONLY THE SMALLEST VESICLES, WHICH ARE STABLE TO LEAKAGE OF ENCAPSULATED MATERIAL WHILE CIRCULATING IN THE BLOOD, ARE CAPABLE OF TUMOR TARGETING MAY LEAD TO A RENEWED INTEREST IN THESE ENTITIES. IF FAVORABLE TUMOR TARGETING CAN BE DEMONSTRATED, THIS APPROACH COULD HAVE WIDESPREAD HEALTH BENEFITS AND COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS.",

INTRODUCTION - ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING APPROACHES TO THE TREATMENT OF LYMPOCYTIC MALIGNANCIES IS THE USE OF MONOCLONAL ANTI--IDIOTYPIC ANTIBODIES DIRECTED AGAINST THE SURFACE IMMUNOGLOBULIN OF MALIGNANT B LYMPHOCYTES. SUCH REAGENTS COMBINE WITH MALIGNANT LYMPHOCYTES BUT NOT WITH NORMAL CELLS. THE MOST CONCRETE SUCCESS WITH THIS APPROACH WAS REPORTED BY A GROUP UNDER DR. RON LEVY AT STANFORD. IN A PATIENT EFFLICTED WITH DIFFUSE, POORLY DIFFERENTIATED LYMPHOCYTIC LYMPHOMA, MONOCLONAL ANTI-IDIOTYPIC ANTIBODY INDUCED A COMPLETE REMISSION WHICH HAS CONTINUED FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. ALTHOUGH NO FURTHER CLINICAL TRIALS HAVE BEEN REPORTED, THE APPROACH SEEMS SO PROMISING THAT BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER HAS INITIATED RESEARCH INTO THE PRODUCTION OF ANTI-IDIOTYPIC ANTIBODIES FOR THIS PURPOSE. THE PROCESS OF PRODUCING THESE ANTIBODIES CONSISTS OF MANY STEPS, BUT ONE OF THESE, THE SOMATIC CELL HYBRIDIZATION OF MALIGNANT B LYMPHOCYTES FOR ISOLATION OF MALIGNANT CELL SURFACE IMMUNOGLOBULIN, PRESENTS A PARTICULAR PROBLEM BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF LYMPHOCYTE CELLS AVAILABLE FROM ALL BUT EXTREMELY ILL PATIENTS. RECENTLY A NEW FUSION TECHNIQUE HAS BEEN EXPLORED WHICH USES ELECTRONIC RATHER THAN CHEMICAL FORCES TO INDUCE FUSION. THIS ELECTRONIC CELL FUSION TECHNIQUE OFFERS MANY ATTRACTIVE FEATURES BUT THE MOST CRITICAL IS ITS ABILITY TO FUSE VERY SMALL NUMBERS OF CELLS WITH EXTREMELY HIGH FUSION FREQUENCY. WE HAVE CONDUCTED INITIAL FUSION EXPERIMENTS ON BOTH MOUSE AND HUMAN CELLS WITH THIS TECHNIQUE AND HAVE ACHIEVED VERY PROMISING RESULTS. WE PROPOSE TO CONDUCT RESEARCH ON THE ELECTRONIC CELL FUSION TECHNIQUE AND COLLABORATE WITH BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER IN APPLYING IT TO THEIR PROJECT. BY THE CONCLUSION OF THE PHASE I - PHASE II PROGRAM, THE ELECTRONIC CELL FUSION TECHNIQUE SHOULD BE AVAILABLE AS A WIDELY USED TOOL FOR CANCER RESEARCH AND THE WORK AT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER SHOULD BE ACCELERATED.",
