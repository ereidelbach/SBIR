THE EXPERT TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION SYSTEM WILL COMBINE OBSERVATIONS, EXPERIENCE, INSIGHT, RULES OF GOOD PRACTICE, PLAUSIBLE REASONING, AND KNOWLEDGE OF WIDELY ACCEPTED PROCEDURES AND METHODS. EXPERIENCE WILL BE OBTAINED FROM INTERVIEWING REACTOR OPERATORS, REACTOR OPERATING TRAINING PERSONNEL, AND CONSULTANTS.

THE NEUTRONICS MODEL WILL BE CONSTRUCTED SO AS TO BE ENHANCED AND INTEGRATED EASILY WITH A THERMAL/HYDRAULICS MODEL IN PHASE II. BOTH MODELS WILL THEN BE IMPLEMENTED ON A HOST MINI/MULTIPROCESSOR COMPUTER TO ACHIEVE REAL-TIME PERFORMANCE. PLANT SENSOR SIGNALS WILL BE OBTAINED FROM A PWR (PRESSURIZED WATER REACTOR) SIMULATION LOOP THAT IS CURRENTLY UNDER INDEPENDENT DEVELOPMENT AND, IF POSSIBLE, ON A REACTOR TRAINING SIMULATOR.

PRESENT METHODS AND HARDWARE REPRESENT WORLD WAR II TECHNOLOGY. A MODULAR BARGE INTERFACE SYSTEM USING A COMPUTER-CONTROLLED, ELECTRO-HYDRAULICALLY ACTUATED, CARGO TRANSFER SYSTEM COULD SAFELY AND RELIABLY HANDLE CONTAINERIZED OR BREAKBULK CARGO IN CONDITIONS ABOVE SS3 AND POSSIBLE SS6. EMERGING TECHNOLOGY WOULD BE APPLIED TO DEVELOP A VERY INTELLIGENT ROBOTIC CARGO HANDLING SYSTEM TO LOAD/UNLOAD SHIPS AND TO INTEGRATE CARGO TRANSFER WITH LIGHTERAGE SEAWAY MOTION. THE SYSTEM WOULD BE MODULAR FOR DEPLOYMENT. THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR HAS ASSEMBLED A TEAM THAT UNDERSTANDS THE ARMY'S PROBLEM AND CAN DESIGN AND FABRICATE ADVANCED SYSTEMS HARDWARE FOR DEVELOPMENT, TEST, AND PRODUCTION. THE TEAM DRAWS ENGINEERING EXPERIENCE FROM THIS NATION'S MOST ADVANCED R&D PROGRAMS, SUCH AS FUSION REACTOR DEVELOPMENT UNDERWAY AT PRINCETON AND ROBOTICS/ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR MAJOR INDUSTRY LEADERS. OTHER SELECTED EXPERIENCE INCLUDES ALMOST 30 YEARS IN AMPHIBIOUS OPERATIONS AND ALMOST 10 YEARS IN DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURE OF MOTION SIMULATORS.

ONE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT MANY ENZYMES REQUIRE COFACTORS CALLED COENZYMES TO BE CATALYTICALLY ACTIVE. COENZYMES ARE EXPENSIVE AND MAKE THE PROCESS UNECONOMICAL. A GROUP OF ENZYMES PARTICULARLY WELL SUITED FOR THE PREPARATION OF PURE ENANTIOMERS ARE THE OXIDOREDUCTASES THAT USE NICOTINAMIDE ADENINE DINUCLEOTIDE (NAD) AS A COENZYME. PRACTICAL PROCESSES CAN BE DEVISED USING CATALYTIC QUANTITIES OF THE COENZYME WHEN THE ENZYME REACTION IS COUPLED TO A COENZYME REGENERATION SCHEME. THE BEST CURRENTLY AVAILABLE COENZYME REGENERATION SCHEMES HAVE A NUMBER OF DRAWBACKS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: 1) THEY USE EXPENSIVE ENZYME CATALYSTS, AND 2) THE REGENERATION SCHEME PRODUCES BYPRODUCTS THAT COMPLICATE THE ISOLATION OF THE DESIRED PRODUCT. IN THIS PROPOSAL BEND RESEARCH, INC. DESCRIBES A NEW PROCESS FOR NADH REGENERATION USING THE INEXPENSIVE ENZYME ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE OBTAINED FROM YEAST. THE NOVEL PART OF OUR REGENERATION SCHEME IS THE USE OF A MEMBRANE REACTOR TO CONTINUOUSLY AND SELECTIVELY REMOVE THE PRODUCT OF THE REGENERATION REACTION, ACETALDEHYDE, AND THEREBY DRIVE THE REACTION TO COMPLETION. THE PROPOSE TO DEMONSTRATE THE PRACTICALITY OF THIS REGENERATION SCHEME BY COUPLING OUR REGENERATION PROCESS TO THE PRODUCTION OF CHIRAL D-LACTIC ACID, AN EXPENSIVE PRECURSOR USED IN THE SYNTHESIS OF SEVERAL COMMERCIAL HERBICIDES.",

POLYMERIC MEMBRANESNOW IN USE ARE CAPABLE OF ONLY LIMITED SELECTIVITY, WHICH LEAVES SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF IMPURITIES IN THE HYDROGEN STREAM. THOSE MEMBRANES ARE ALSO HEAT-SENSITIVE; CONSEQUENTLY, MANY HYDROGEN-CONTAINING FEED STREAMS MUST BE COOLED BEFORE PROCESSING. METAL MEMBRANES OVERCOME MOST OF THESE PROBLEMS BY BEING HIGHLY SELECTIVE AND RESISTANT TO TEMPERATURES OF UP TO 500 DEGREE CELLCIUS. HOWEVER, CURRENT METALLIC HYDROGEN-SEPARATION MEMBRANES HAVE AN EXTREMELY HIGH CAPITAL COST, AS THEY ARE COMPOSED OF PALLADIUM ALLOYED WITHSILVER. IN THIS PROGRAM, BEND RESEARCH, INC.

IN ORDER TO PREVENT OXIDES FROM FORMING ON THE SURFACE OF THE ALLOY AND THUS IMPEDING HYDROGEN TRANSPORT, ALLOY FILMS WILLBE CLEANED AND THEN COATED WITH A THIN LAYER ( 1 ) OF A NON-OXIDIZING METAL SUCH AS PALLADIUM OR NICKEL.

ADVANTAGES OF SUCH SYSTEM OVER CONVENTIONAL LASER BEAM MIRRORS ARE THE INABILITY OF MIRRORS TO DEFLECT AT HIGH SPEEDS DUE TO THE MIRROR'S INERTIA. AS A RESULT WITH ELECTRONIC ACOUSTO-OPTIC DEVICES, THEIR PERFORMANCE AND HENCE SPEED IS THAT OF THE ORDER OF ELECTRONIC SWITCHING. ALSO MIRRORS REQUIRE LARGE POWER CONSUMPTIONS WHEREBY ACOUSTIC RF POWER GENERATIONS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS. AN ADVANTAGE OF CONSTRUCTING ACOUSTO-OPTIC LASER BEAM DEFLECTORS IS THAT DEFLECTION ANGLE IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE FREQUENCY. FOR EXAMPLE, WITH PRESENT BRIMROSE ACOUSTO-OPTIC DEVICES LASER BEAM DEFLECTION ANGLES ARE TYPICALLY 6-12 DEG GHZ.

THE COUPLING OF HUMAN EXPERTISE WITH ANALYTIC MODELS ALLOW SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED. BUT MANY OF THESE PROBLEMS ARE SO COMPLEX THAT THE MATHEMATICS ARE INTRACTABLE, REQUIRING THE USE OF SIMULATION, WHICH CAN BE BOTH EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING. MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE EXPERTISE REQUIRED TO USE SIMULATION EFFECTIVELY MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE. IT APPEARS THAT AI PLANNING AND KNOWLEDGE BASED SIMULATION TECHNIQUES, WHEN COUPLED TOGETHER, CAN ENHANCE THE PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF HUMAN LOGISTICS PLANNERS. THIS PROPOSAL FOCUSES ON TWO ISSUES: PLANNING TECHNIQUES FOR ANSWERING \"HOW CAN I\" QUESTIONS, AND ITS LINKAGE TO; KNOWLEDGE BASED SIMULATION TECHNIQUES FOR ANSWERING \"WHAT IF\" QUESTIONS. OUR APPROACH TO PLANNING WILL BE TO CONSTRUCT AN INTERACTIVE PLANNER WHICH USES KNOWLEDGE TO CRITICIZE AND GUIDE THE PLANNING PROCESS. THE PLANNER WILL BE CONSTRUCTED USING A BLACKBOARD ARCHITECTURE, ENABLING IT TO BE PERUSED BY THE LOGISTICIAN AND EFFECTIVELY COUPLED WITH THE SIMULATION SYSTEM. THE MAJORITY OF OUR EFFORT WILL FOCUS ON SIMULATION TOOLS. FOR THE CLASS OF COMPLEX PROBLEMS FOR WHICH SIMULATION IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY, KNOWLEDGE BASED SIMULATION (KBS) (REDDY ETAL., 1986) CAN BE USED MOST EFFECTIVELY TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS. HOWEVER, THE CONSTRUCTION AND ANALYSIS OF KBS MODELS STILL REMAINS EXPENSIVE. ALTHOUGH AI REPRESENTATION TECHNIQUES ARE USE, THE DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION, AND ANALYSIS OF KBS MODELS REQUIRES A VARIETY OF KNOWLEDGE (E.G., DOMAIN INFORMATION, STATISTICAL ANALYSISTECHNIQUES) AND SKILLS (E.G., EXPERIMENT DESIGN) POSSESSED BY FEW.

IT IS ALSO ESSENTIAL IN ASSESSING PROGNOSIS AND CHOOSING THE APPROPRIATE FORM OF THERAPY FOR INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS. VISUAL INTERPRETATION OF THE CORONARY ARTERIOGRAMIS THE STANDARD FOR DEFINING THE PATHOANATOMY IN CORONARY HEART DISEASE. HOWEVER, THERE ARE INHERENT LIMITATIONS IN THIS METHOD OF INTERPRETATION. TYPICALLY, THE OBSERVER WILLDERIVE AN ESTIMATE OF THE PERCENT OF VESSEL DIAMETER NARROW-ING BY LOOKING AT AND AVERAGING TWO VIEWS TAKEN AT RIGHT ANGLES TO EACH OTHER. A SIGNIFICANT ERROR OF ESTIMATING LUMEN-SIZE MAY RESULT WHEN AN ATHEROSCLEROTIC PLAQUE IS NOT PERFECTLY ROUND OR CONCENTRICALLY LOCATED WITHIN THE LUMEN; IN FACT, THE MAJORITY OF LESIONS ARE ECCENTRIC AND MANY HAVEIRREGULAR SHAPES. THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP AN IMPROVED, OBJECTIVE METHOD FOR THREE-DIMENSIONAL RECONSTRUCTION OF CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHIC DATA. THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED BY APPLY-ING REFINEMENTS OF A NOVEL ALGORITHM TO ALREADY DEVELOPED COMPUTERIZED DENSITOMETRIC TECHNIQUES. THE ALGORITHM MAY READILY BE APPLIED TO A LARGE NUMBER OF IMAGE FRAMES. THE GOAL OF THE EFFORT IS TO DEVELOP A REAL-TIME ALGORITHM FOR ANGIOGRAPHIC DATA, WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR RELIABLE DECISIONS FOR CHOOSING THERAPY AND IMMEDIATE DECISIONS WHILE DOING BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY.

THE SENSITIVITY OF THE PIEZO-ELECTRIC CRYSTAL INCREASES WITH THE SQUARE OF ITS FREQUENCY. THE CONVENTIONAL CRYSTAL WHICH IS DRIVEN IN BULK VIBRATION HAS A PRACTICAL LIMIT OF ABOUT 10 MHZ IN FUNDAMENTAL FREQUENCY, BECAUSE HIGHER FREQUENCY REQUIRES THINNER CRYSTAL, WHICH IS MECHANICAL TOO FRAGILE. IN THE SAW CRYSTAL THE VIBRATION TAKES PLACE ALONG THE SURFACE, AND CAN BE MADE TO REACH 100 MHZ WITHOUT THE PROBLEM OF STRUCTURAL FRAGILITY.

THE BASIC GAGE HAS DEMONSTRATED ABILITY TO MEASURE STATIC STRAINS ACCURATELY AT TEMPERATURESUP TO 1500 DEGREE FAHRENHEIT. THIS LIMITATION OF 1500 DEGREE FAHRENHEIT IS DUE TO ELECTRICAL LEAKAGE IN THE INSULATORS AND CABLE. THE GAGE ITSELF IS STABILIZED AT 2000 DEGREE FAHRENHEIT DURING MANUFACTURING, AND COULD OPERATE AT LEAST FOR A SHORT TIME AT THIS TEMPERATURE. MORE RECENT MODIFICATIONS TO THE SIGNAL CONDITIONING 2 INCREASE THE INSTRUMENTS CAPACITY TO TOLERATE MORE SEVERE ELECTRICAL LEAKAGE. WITH THIS IMPROVEMENT COMBINED WITH BETTER INSULATION, THE GAGE SHOULD OPERATE WELL ABOVE 2000 DEGREE FAHRENHEIT USING CURRENT TECHNOLOGY. THE FIRST PHASE OF THE PROJECT WOULD STUDY METHODS OF IMPROVING GAGE COMPONENTS SUCH AS IMPROVED FLESURE DESIGNS, POSSIBLE USE OF CERAMIC BEARINGS IN PLACE OF FLEXURES, AND AN OVERALL MINIATURIZATION OF THE GAGE. THE USE OF CERAMIC COMPONENTS SUCH AS ALUMINA, SILICON CARBIDE, AND SILICON NITRIDE WITH SPUTTERED INSULATION AND SPUTTERED THIN FILM CAPACITOR PLATE COULD SUBSTAINTIALLY INCREASE RUGGEDNESS AND PROVIDE MINIATURIZATION.

MORE IMPORTANTLY, FOUR SENSITIVITY TEST PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN PERFORMED ON HIGHLY NITRATED HTPB, AND IT WAS SHOWN TO BE LESS SENSITIVE THAN CURRENT EXPLOSIVE INGREDIENTS, PROBABLY DUE TO OXYGEN ADDITION TO THE POLYMER BACKBONE THROUGH NITRATE ESTERS.THE COMBINATION OF INSENSITIVITY, OXYGEN CONTENT, AND ENERGETIC PROPERTIES OF THE BINDER SHOULD GREATLY EXPAND THE EXPLOSIVE REFORMULATION OPTIONS TO PROVIDE LOW VULNERABILITY EXPLOSIVES AS ENERGETIC AS COMPOSITION B.

WALLS AND OBSTRUCTIONS SUCH AS PIPES AND MACHINERY WILL BE REPRESENTED USING LIGHTWEIGHT, INEXPENSIVE MATERIALS TO ALLOW MODEL RECONFIGURATION FOR MORE COMPREHENSIVE TESTING. NAVIGATION INSIDE OF COMPLEX STRUCTURES CAN BE BROKEN INTO TWO MAJOR TASKS: GLOBAL PATH PLANNING AND LOCAL SUBPATH FOLLOWING. HOWEVER, PHASE I OF THIS PROJECT WILL CONCENTRATE ON LOCAL SUBPATH FOLLOWING ALGORITHM DEVELOPMENT. THE ALGORITHM WILL DETERMINE A POSITION TO COMMAND THE GANTRY ROBOT TO MOVE TO, WHICH WILL BE THE SUBPATH GOAL OR AN INTERMEDIATE POINT IF ANY OBSTACLES ARE SENSED THAT BLOCK THE PATH. THROUGH SENSORY INPUT FROM THE IMAGING LASER SCANNER, THE ALGORITHM WILL DETERMINE ALTERNATE ROUTES FOR THE ROBOT TO TRAVEL UNTIL THE ULTIMATE DESTINATION OR GOAL IS ACHIEVED.",

WHEN THE LOWER PRESSURE SIDE OF THE POROUS SURFACE IS COUPLED TO A JET PUMP, SO DESIGNED THAT IT CAN RECIRCULATE THE LIQUID FLOW, THEN A COMPACT AND RELIABLE VAPOR-LIQUID SEPARATOR HAVING NO MOVING PARTS IS AVAILABLE TO THE RANKINE CYCLE SPACE POWER SOURCE. PHASE I OF THIS RESEARCH IS DEVOTED TO EXAMINING SPECIFIC DESIGN CONCEPTS USING A VARIETY OF POROUS MATERIALS, GEOMETRIES, AND WORKING FLUIDS. BOTH THE DIRECT-CYCLE POTASSIUM-COOLED REACTOR SYSTEM AND THE LITHIUM-POTASSIUM REACTOR SYSTEM WILL BE EXAMINED. THE POROUS BARRIER LOCATION MAY BE AT VARIOUS LOCATIONS OR COMBINATIONS THEREOF, INCLUDING THE BOILER OUTLET, PIPING SECTIONS, OR SPECIFIC LOCATIONS IN THE TURBINE. EXPERIMENTAL DATA FROM GASEOUS DIFFUSION BARRIER TECHNOLOGY AND FROM LOW-GRAVITY (AIRCRAFT FLIGHT) TESTS OF THE MEDIUM POWER REACTOR EXPERIMENT (MPRE) WILL BE USED. VIABLE MATERIALS AND GEOMETRIES WILL BE ASSEMBLED AND TESTED DURING PHASE II USING WATER-STEAM MIXTURES. ARRANGEMENTS WILL BE MADE WITH THE OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LABORATORY TO TEST SOME LIQUID METAL SYSTEMS IN EXISTING FACILITIES. THESE PHASE II TESTS SHALL INCLUDE THOSE SYSTEMS DEEMED VIABLE FOR SPACE APPLICATIONS AND THOSE CONSIDERED COMMERCIALLY ATTRACTIVE.",

METALLIC NUCLEAR FUEL IN THE SHAPE OF LONG, THIN RODS IS THE FUEL USED BY THEINTEGRAL FAST REACTOR. THE METALLIC NUCLEAR FUEL RODS ARE PRESENTLY FABRICATED IN A BATCH-CASTING PROCESS THAT UTILIZES QUARTZ TUBES OF PRECISE DIMENSIONS AS MOLDS. IN THIS PROCESS, MOLTEN FUEL IS INJECTED INTO THE QUARTZ TUBES AND ALLOWED TO COOL AND SOLIDIFY. THE QUARTZ TUBES ARE THEN BROKEN TO REMOVE THE FUEL RODS. THE BATCH-CASTING PROCESS DESCRIBED ABOVE HAS SEVERAL UNDESIRABLE FEATURES THAT, THOUGH PROBLEMATIC FOR LABORATORY-SCALE OPERATIONS, MAY PROVE UNTENABLE FOR LARGE-SCALE PRODUCTION. FIRST, THE PRECISION QUARTZ MOLDS ARE DESTROYED AFTER FIRST USE AND ARE THEREFORE NOT COST EFFICIENT. ALSO, THE QUARTZ BECOMES SLIGHTLY RADIOACTIVE DURING SOLIDIFICATION; THE BROKEN MOLDS THEREFORE CONSTITUTE RADIATIVE WASTE, WHICH MUST BE SAFELY STORED OR REPROCESSED. FURTHER, BITS OF NUCLEAR FUEL MAY BE LOST WHEN BREAKING THE MOLD, MAKING IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ACCOUNT PRECISELY FOR THE WHEREABOUTSOF ALL OF THE NUCLEAR FUEL. FINALLY, THE MOLD MAY CONTAMINATE THE FUEL BY DIFFUSION, ESPECIALLY WHILE THE FUEL IS IN THE LIQUID STATE. IN THIS PROJECT IT IS PLANNED TO ASSESS, AND THEN DEVELOP IF FEASIBLE, A CONTINUOUS CASTING PROCESS THAT CAN MITIGATE OR ELIMINATE THE UNDESIRABLE FEATURES OF THE PRESENT BATCH-MOLDING METHOD OF FORMING METALLIC NUCLEAR FUEL RODS. CONTINUOUS CASTING, USED COMMONLY FOR STRUCTURAL METALS SUCH AS STEEL, ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR MOLDS, ASSOCIATED RADIOACTIVE WASTE, AND THE POTENTIAL FOR LOSS OF SOLIDIFIED MATERIAL DURING MOLD BREAKING.

THIS CONFIGURATION IS BASED ON TWO HOLOGRAPHIC CONCEPTS FUNCTIONING TOGETHER WITH OPTOELECTRONICS IN INTERCONNECTING SIGNAL AMONG VLSI PROCESSORS OR SUBSYSTEMS. THE RESULTING INTERCONNECT CONFIGURATION COMBINES THE TWO HOLOGRAPHIC TECHNOLOGIES IN AN INTEGRATED OPTICS MONOLITHIC FORMAT THAT PERFORMS ULTRA-HIGH DENSITY INTERCONNECT OPERATIONS IN A CO-PLANAR MANNER. USING THIS APPROACH, TWO-DIMENSIONAL COHERENT OPTICAL INTERCONNECT AND PROCESSING IS BEING IMPLEMENTED IN A COMPACT FORMAT WITHOUT THE PACKAGING PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH BULK OPTICAL ELEMENTS.

IN THIS PROGRAM, RES-CAP TECHNIQUE WILL BE EXTENDED TO DETECTING CRITICAL EVENTS IN PROCESSING (1) CARBON-CARBON PRECURSOR STRUCTURES, AND (2) HIGH TEMPERATURE RESISTANT THERMOPLASTIC AND THERMOSETTING COMPOSITES. IMPROVEMENTS IN DETECTOR SENSITIVITY, OPERATION AT HIGHER FREQUENCIES AND MODIFICATIONS OF ELECTRODES TO WITHSTAND TEMPERATURES OF 800 DEG F MAY BE REQUIRED.

THE DESIGN/PROCESS CHOICES THAT THE MANUFACTURER OF FILAMENTARY COMPOSITES MUST MAKE USUALLY REQUIRE A COMPROMISE BETWEEN CURRENT DENSITY AND PIECE LENGTH. THE REQUIREMENTS FOR SUPERCONDUCTOR PERFORMANCE, FOR EXAMPLE THE HIGHLY DEFORMED MICROSTRUCTURES IN NBTI COMPOSITES OR THE VERY DIFFERENT MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THE COMPONENTS IN NB3SN COMPOSITES, PLACE STRINGENT RESTRICTIONS ON THE AREA REDUCTION PROCESS. WIRE DRAWING IS COST-EFFECTIVE BECAUSE IT CAN BE DONE SEMICONTINUOUSLY; HOWEVER, THE HIGH TENSILE FORCES INVOLVED ARE NOT IDEAL FOR PROCESSING COMPOSITES WITH WIDELY DIFFERING COMPONENTS.

A HIGHLY PROMISING ALTERNATIVE APPEARS TO BE A CONTINUOUS EXTRUSION PROCESS THAT ALLOWS LARGE AREA REDUCTIONS USING COMPRESSIVE FORCES, SMALL STARTING DIAMETERS, AND UNLIMITED LENGTHS.

THE ACCUMULATOR EFFECT IS THE RESULT OF EXPANSION OF PRESSURIZED GASES IN THE GAS GENERATOR VOLUME. THE MASS ADDITION IS BASED ON INJECTION MASS, EITHER SOLID, LIQUID OR GAS, INTO THE BURNING VOLUME. RESTRICTED FLOW IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT GAS GENERATORS WILL BURN AT A FASTER RATE AT THE ELEVATED PRESSURE INDUCED BY RESTRICTING THE EXHAUST FLOW.

THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED BY GRAFTING QUAT MONOMER TO THE SUR- FACE OF THE DOME OR BY TREATMENT WITH A QUAT SILANE TO FORM AN INTERPENETRATING NETWORK ON AND JUST UNDER THE SURFACE. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT IF THE FIRST LAYER OF FOULING CAN BE PREVENTED, THERE WILL BE NO FURTHER FOULING. TREATED SUR- FACES WILL BE EVALUATED FOR MICROFOULING RESISTANCE. MACROFOULING OF SONAR DOMES BY BARNACLES AND OTHER FORMS CAUSES DEGRADATION IN SONAR PERFORMANCE. BUTYL TIN BASED ANTIFOULANTS ARE PRESENTLY USED TO PREVENT THIS GROWTH, BUT THESE COMPOUNDS ARE TOXIC AND PRESENT A HAZARD TO NAVY PERS-ONNEL DURING INSTALLATION AND REMOVAL OF DOMES. PHASE I DEMONSTRATED THE FEASIBILITY OF ALTERNATE TREATMENT SYSTEMS BASED ON QUATERNARY AMMONIUM SILANES, QUATERNARY METHACRYLA-MIDE POLYMERS AND COPPER TANNATE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH LOW SURFACE ENERGY TREATMENTS, INCLUDING FLUOROSILANES AND FLUOROPOLYMERS. THIS PHASE II PROGRAM WILL DEVELOP IPN (INTERPENSTRATING POLYMER NETWORK) SURFACE IMPREGNATION SYS-TEMS BASED ON THE PHASE I CONCEPT. THESE SYSTEMS WILL CON- TAIN A BIOCID(E.G. QUATERNARY AMMONIUM SILANE) TO PREVENT THE PRELIMINARY BACTERIAL BIOLAYER FROM FORMING, A LOW SUR- FACE ENERGY TREATMENT (E.G. FLUOROSILANE) TO DETER THE BIO- LAYER FROM ADHERING TO THE SURFACE, ALL IN AN IPN IMPREGNA- TION TREATMENT TO ENSURE GOOD ABRASION RESISTANCE.

FAULT DETECTION IS ACHIEVED THROUGH NON-INTRUSIVE PERFORMANCE MONITORING, SYSTEM MESSAGE FLOW ANALYSIS AND/OR PERIODIC INTERACTION WITH THE SUBSYSTEMS. FAULT ISOLATION CAPABILITIES BEGIN WITH A SET OF COMMANDS AVAILABLE TO THE USER FOR INTERACTING WITH OTHER SUBSYSTEMS ON THE NETWORK.

MICROCOSM ALSO HAVE TWO PATENTS PENDING ON LOW THRUST TRANSFER AND ORBIT MAINTENANCE. PHASE I WILL CLEARLY ESTABLISH THE TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY OF PROVIDING LOW COST CONTROL FOR AN ELECTRIC PROPULSION OTV FOR DEPLOYMENT OF THE GPS SATELLITES.",

        "abstract": "THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING THE KEY COMPONENTS IN AN ICING SENSOR & ICE PROTECTION SYSTEM (ISIPS) THAT INCORPORATE PIEZOELECTRIC MATERIAL TO SENSE ICE ACCRETION AND TO INHIBITITS BUILDUP. A NOVEL CONCEPT CONCEIVED BY THE PROPOSER THATUTILIZES SOLID STATE PIEZOELECTRIC SENSOR AND ACTUATOR TECHNOLOGY INDICATES THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO PROVIDE BOTH ICESENSING AND ICE PROTECTION WITH THE SAME MATERIAL. THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THIS SYSTEM UTILIZE POLYVINYLIDENE FLUORIDE (PVDF) TRANSDUCER FILM MATERIAL BEING EVALUATED FOR USE IN BOTH SENSING AND ACTUATING COMPONENTS AND A MICROPROCESSOR FOR DIGITAL SIGNAL FILTERING AND FOR CLOSED LOOP DEICING CONTROL. DUE TO ITS EXCELLENT PIEZOELECTRIC PROPERTIES AND BROADBAND RESPONSE, THE PVDF FILM IS ABLE TO SENSE THE VIBRATORY MOTION OF AN ICE ACCRETION SURFACE RESPONDING TO FREQUENCIES FROM A FEW HZ TO KHZ AND HIGHER. BY INCORPORATING A MICROPROCESSOR INTO THIS SYSTEM, A NUMBER OFDESIGN ADVANTAGES IMMEDIATELY BECOME AVAILABLE. IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO CONSTRUCT AN ISIPS THAT DETERMINES THE ICE ONSET, ACCRETION AND ACCRETION RATE AND PROVIDES FOR THE CONTROLLED DISSIPATION OF ICE ON HELICOPTER BLADES, AIRCRAFTWINGS, PARKED AIRCRAFT, AIRCRAFT COMPONENTS, AIRPORT RUNWAYSAND FACILITIES, AND AIRPORT NAVIGATION AID STRUCTURES AS WELL.",
