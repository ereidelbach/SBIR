        "abstract": "The overall objective is to improve the safety and health of firefighters and rescue workers who use self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) in hazardous environment. The specific aim is to develop an electromechanical pressure regulator that assures positive pressure in the SBA facepiece even during strenuous activity. Positive pressure is essential to protect health and safety, because the facepiece pressure keeps out potentially poisonous gases from the environment. The proposed electromechanical pressure regulator overcomes the drawbacks of conventional, mechanical regulators. The three key innovations are: (1) a lightweight, piezoelectrically actuated, electromechanical valve, (2) an innovative electronic control and actuation system that consumes ver little power and (3) a power generating system driven by a trickle flow of compressed air that provides all the power required by the regulator. The rapid responses and wide control range of the electromechanical valve prevent over-breathing. The electronic control unit can warn the user of falling pressure in the mask. Phase I proved feasibility by fabricating a proof-of-concept regulator and testing it under extreme conditions using a SCBA facepiece and a breathing machine. In Phase II we will develop and demonstrate prototype regulators for commercial SCBAs which meet all relevant NIOSH and NFPA standards. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The primary applications is for a pressure-demand, positive-pressure, self-contained breathing apparatus worn by firefighters and hazardous materials workers. The device can be incorporated into new SCBA units and can also be retrofit to units already in the field. We estimate the potential market to be in the range of 10,000 to 100,000 per year. Create has teamed with one of the largest manufacturers of SCBAs to commercialize the electromechanical SCBA regulator.",

        "abstract": "Not Available Ozone is arguably the most important trace gas in the atmosphere, and improved monitoring of ozone\nthroughout the atmosphere is essential. This Phase 2 project continues the development of a complete,\nautomated system for measuring ozone from on board commercial aircraft. There is already one program\nwithin NOAA, CAAMP (Commercial Aircraft Atmospheric Measurement Program), for measuring a variety of\ntrace gases in this manner. Since the logistics and cost to install commercially available ozone\ninstruments and data recorders on a large number of commercial aircraft would be prohibitive, it is\nimperative to develop a compact, self-contained system specifically designed for these measurements.\nThe ozone analyzer is based on a compact UV-absorption design originated at the University of Colorado\nfor use on meteorological balloons. In Phase 1, this design was modified for use in a pressurized aircraft,\nand ADA-designed electronics were added. In Phase 2, the design will be refined, including packaging for\nmounting in standard avionics racks and adding interfaces to communicate with aircraft systems. The\nPhase 2 instrument will receive various parameters (location, altitude, time) from data bus, as well as\ncommunicate ozone data onto the data bus, enabling a variety of data recording or real-time reporting\noptions.",

        "abstract": "Not Available In the summer of 1998 over 2.8 million acres of farmland in the Southern U.S. was planted in genetically engineered cotton expressing a gene derived from the bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). This Bt gene codes for production of a protein that is toxic to some of the most important lepidopteran pests of U.S. cotton. The future expansion of this new technology on more cotton acreage and in other crops is expected to have important environmental and economic benefits.\n\nThe development of resistance by key pest species to Bt toxins could negate the value of transgenic Bt technology in crop protection. The EPA, industry and many scientists have concluded a system of monitoring Bt resistance is needed. Such a system requires tests that can measure the resistance of insects to Bt toxins in a simple, inexpensive and reliable way. The proposed program is focused at optimizing, developing and validating a novel, practical method for detecting and measuring the resistance of insects to Bt toxins using feeding disruption technology and hydrateable insect meal pads. During the Phase I study, feasibility was demonstrated for this method when testing tobacco budworm and cotton bollworm for resistance to Bt and several chemical insecticides.",

Key features of the system are the ability to access multiple remote sites that contain monitoring equipment, using software that the grower is already familiar with. From a map the grower will click on icons for individual sensors or groups of sensors to see both real-time values and historical data. Sensors available to the network will include soil moisture, temperature, resistivity, and local weather station data. Under the Phase I SBIR an improved soil moisture sensor (SMRT Probe) as a key element of the monitoring system was designed and built, and a web browser based data acquisition system for the SMRT Probe was used to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept. Additional sensors, such as a nitrate-nitrogen sensor and pH will be investigated to be added to the system. Using this information the grower can monitor fluctuations in soil moisture as they correlate with weather conditions to make more informed irrigation decisions and maximize the efficiency of the water used.",

        "abstract": "Not Available Paper recycling continues to increase in the United States, with public support and legislative mandates helping boost recycling of all paper grades. Office waste paper is a significant source of high grade paper fiber for recycling, but is currently underutilized, due to the challenges of fully removing xerographic and laser printer toner. These so called *laser inks* are designed to fuse to the page during printing and tend to resist removal by conventional deinking processes. In a Phase I SBIR grant, AVEKA Inc. proposed the development of novel toners that would improve office paper deinking performance by reformulating the toner. The Phase I results indicate that toner deinking can be improved, in some cases dramatically, with this approach, which targets the active components directly to the toner-fiber interface. This *Near Field Effect* targeting improves deinking while minimizing additives already used by the recycling industry.",

A large percentage of hardwood is relegated to low value uses by virtue of naturally occurring character (knots, coloration, etc.). Many rural communities have abundant supplies of low value wood yet few opportunities currently exist to derive substantial economic benefit from this resource. Beeken/Parsons proposes to produce high value furniture from character wood in a way that builds upon the capacity of rural northern Vermont. Phase I research revealed broad market potential for fine furniture made with character wood and identified factors critical to consumer acceptance of this furniture. Now the most efficient means of maximizing economic and social benefits must be determined. Phase II will explore methods by which a rural community can sustain its timber and manufacturing resources and retain marketing and distribution profits. This research will 1) develop and analyze techniques which efficiently address the harvesting, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution challenges unique to character marked wood and 2) test the hypothesis that a symbiotic community of rural manufacturing and marketing businesses is a practical and feasible way to maximize local economic benefit.",

Unfortunately, the disease is obvious only in the clinical form. Subclinical mastitis is about 15 to 40 times more prevalent and accounts for approximately 70% of all economic losses because of reduced milk yield. Many teat germicide products are available but most are not completely effective due to lack of germicidal persistence throughout the intermilking period.\n\nThe goal of this project is to complete the development of combination teat dip and barrier product which provides persistent protection against mastitis-causing pathogens during the intermilking period. The technical objectives of this study are to: 1) determine final coating formulation, 2) evaluate coatings in vitro for microbiological efficacy, and 3) evaluate coatings in vivo for safety and efficacy.",

The best opportunity for sustainable economic development is lucrative black pearl farming. This offers great potential, but wild oysters are scarce, and prospective local farmers lack necessary support.\n\nOur first commercial farm in Majuro has attracted $2.1 million in American investment. With growout technology in hand, there is vast potential for expansion. We plan to use nucleus estate joint ventures with local farmers to drive this expansion in outer atolls. This project addresses technical, logistical, and sociological challenges with establishing and supporting operations in the remote, rural Pacific.\n\nPhase I demonstrated the efficiency of the containerized hatchery as the center for the nucleus estate. Phase II research will determine best strategies for structuring joint ventures to fit the social, cultural and legal framework of rural atoll communities. This can be a model for pearl development throughout the country, and aquaculture development throughout the region. Satellite farms, modeled on a nucleus estate framework, would receive spat from containerized hatchery operations, together with technical management, training, pearl seeding, marketing and supply services. Local partners can provide access to land, lagoon sites, and labor.",

Cryo-ESR's are widely used as the most accurate absolute standards of radiative flux and irradiance. In Phase 2, we will focus on the additional research required to demonstrate that the advantages of SCT thermometry can be translated into: (a) LN2-cooled ESR's of comparable accuracy, but easier accessibility, than conventional, LHe-cooled instruments; (b) LHe-cooled ESR's capable of improved detectivity for detector calibrations in the aerospace industry; and (c) more stable pyrheliometers operating at 90 K for space-borne monitoring of radiations in solar total and ultraviolet irradiance. This research will include development of high-Tcsuperconducting heater leads having low thermal conductance, of an SCT thermometer based on thin metal films with Tc between 2-4 K, and characterization of a prototype LN2-cooled ESR through intercomparison with LHe-cooled ESR's at CRI, and calibration at the NIST HACR facility. CRI is the world's leading manufacturer of cryo-ESR's, and identifies total domestic and foreign markets of $10-15 M for this important new technology if the Phase 2 objectives in accuracy and system detectivity can be met.",

        "abstract": "Not Available Anhydrous ammonia (NH3), a heavily used nitrogen fertilizer, is a volatile gas which flashes at -40 F. It is handles as pressurized liquid and difficult to meter accurately and dispense. Its low cost, due to inexpensive energy, has encouraged wasteful over-application rather than investment in currently costly and ineffective application control systems. Ammonia costs will increase with energy costs and environmental concerns over nitrates in ground water will motivate growers to more efficiently apply NH3.\n\nThis project will apply pulse-width modulation, already proven for liquid agrochemicals, to NH3 dispensing. Specifically, PWM control will maintain ammonia as liquid during metering and distribution across the tool bar. Additionally, a thermal recovery manifold will capture the cooling from the expansion downstream of the metering valves and cool the incoming ammonia. A simple electronic system and user interface will control the metering valves and monitor the thermodynamic state of the ammonia to assure accurate dispensing.\n\nBased on Phase I results, the system is expected to greatly improve the uniformity of application across the tool bar boom and provide a much faster response and significantly wider range of application rates than existing technology. The system will be easily adapted to GPS and variable rate application.",

        "abstract": "Not Available Computational Geosciences, Inc. will develop and implement a Doppler Radar Irrigation Scheduling System (DRISS). It will be a real-time, operational system specifically designed to meet the irrigation scheduling information requirements of an irrigation district. DRISS will capitalize on the enhanced capabilities of Doppler radar technology to provide (1) a more accurate estimate of rainfall and (2) a better spatial distribution of the rainfall over the district. It will provide high-resolution information on current hydrometeorological conditions, as well as short-term forecasts (10-14 days) of present hydrometeorological conditions and crop water requirements. This information will assist the end user in responding to dynamically changing hydrometeorological conditions, and allow implementation of an optimum irrigation scheduling and water allocation strategy. This will improve the efficiency of water delivery for the district and make more water available to farmers.\n\nDRISS will be a scientifically-based system that integrates naturally occurring rainfall, irrigation data, crop water use, and crop growth stage to develop current hydrological conditions and short-term projections of hydrological conditions for the district. Irrigation water volumes are immense and even modest increases in efficiency can have substantial financial and environmental benefits. These efficiency increases will be realized through DRISS.",

        "abstract": "Not Available Despite major advances in CFD technology over the past two decades, simulation of industrial spray combustion systems remains challenging due to difficulties in modeling various droplet physical phenomena and in dealing with the geometrical complexity. The proposed study will develop a 3-dimensional code incorporating advanced physical models for droplet transport/vaporization and spray combustion by using solution-adaptive unstructured meshes and efficient parallel algorithms. \n\nThe Phase 1 effort demonstrated proof-of-concept by developing a baseline spray dynamics module incorporating heat and mass transfer and coupling it with an existing unstructured reactive flow solver. Comparison of model predictions for non-evaporating and burning sprays with experimental data showed good agreement. In Phase 2, the code will be extended to include state-of-the art models for droplet physics, such as multi-component droplets; droplet-turbulence interactions; droplet deformation, breakup and collisions; soot and gaseous emissions; detailed chemical kinetics; and group combustion, and stochastic spray. Additionally, solution-adaptive meshing techniques and algorithm improvements will be incorporated into the code. As part of a verification study, the developed code will be subjected to a series of test cases for which analytical solutions are available. Comprehensive benchmark validation of the code will be performed against data being collected at the NIST Spray Combustion Facility. A variety of full-scale 3-D waste fuel furnace/incinerator simulations will be performed to demonstrate the capabilities of the code. Prof. Aswani Gupta of the University of Maryland and Prof. Clayton Crowe of Washington State University will be consultants during the Phase 2 project. Phase 3 commitments and endorsements have been obtained from Optomec, BMW--Rolls-Royce and Geo-Centers, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Not Available Infectious hematopoeitic necrosis (IHN) is a highly contagious rhabdoviral disease of important species of trout and salmon. There are presently no proven or accepted methods for prevention or treatment of IHN. Under the intensive conditions of aquaculture, IHN virus (IHNV) causes significant losses at nearly all stages of production. The results of Phase I studies indicated that intraspecific variation for IHNV resistance exists in rainbow trout and steelhead. The results of molecular genetic studies indicated that sufficient genetic variation exists both within and between the two strains of Oncorhynchus mykiss to allow for identification of genetic markers associated with IHN resistance which would significantly reduce the time required to develop IHN resistant strains.\n\nThe Phase II research will determine the linkage of molecular markers to quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with resistance to IHN. Disease resistance has a high environmental component of variability in expression, making it difficult to not only study but also to breed for the trait. Finding a molecular marker that is linked to a QTL will permit more rapid gains in selection for improvement in IHN resistance by marker assisted selection. This approach has found widespread use in plant breeding for viral disease resistance.",

        "abstract": "Not Available Tunnel ventilation is an effective means of protecting and enhancing the productivity of livestock (especially swine and egg layers) in large scale confinement barns. The capital and operating costs for these fan installations typically represents a significant fraction of the total costs to the livestock producer.\n\nThe Phase I research program has shown that significant improvements (ca. 40 percent in airflow and 10 percent in efficiency) can be obtained by the judicious use of active control flows. The Phase II proposal is to permit optimized ventilation systems to be designed using advanced CFD (computational fluid dynamics) methods. The CFD codes will be proof-tested using baseline data (first iteration) and used to define the predicted/optimized configurations: the second iteration. Experiments will confirm (or suggest modifications to) the latter.",

        "abstract": "Not Available Wood fiber reinforced cement complements the high tensile strength, toughness, impact resistance and workability of wood with the fire resistance, durability and dimensional stability of cement-based materials, offering a unique balance of performance characteristics and aesthetic qualities at competitive cost. Current wood fiber cement processing systems, however, yield products of relatively high permeability and low resistance to freeze-thaw and natural carbonation, with strict geometric and aesthetic limitations. This project investigates extrusion as an alternative means of wood fiber cement mass production. Our Phase I research has demonstrated that refined wood fiber cement mixtures can provide rheological attributes suiting extrusion, yielding geometrically diverse extruded products of distinctly high durability with a desirable balance of technical and aesthetic qualities. The proposed Phase II research will optimize the extrusion system of wood fiber cement on a broad raw material basis, and will adapt the system to satisfy market needs in diverse fields of application. The proposed Phase II research will: (1) optimize the process variables of extrusion in light of the rheological attributes of wood fiber cement; (2) develop cementitious matrix mix compositions optimally suiting extrusion with diverse wood fiber types; and (3) identify and explore markets of greatest commercial promise for extruded wood fiber cement products.",

        "abstract": "Not Available Over 80% of the local governments in the United States serve rural communities. The incremental, day to day decisions made in these municipalities and local agencies form much of the practical base of land and resource planning. If the quality of these local decisions can be improved, a concomitant increase in the overall national quality of land use planing is likely to follow. The goal of this proposed research is to bring proactive, predictive planning tools to rural communities.\n\nThe decision told proposed here will be developed from the Digital Orthophoto Quadrangles, (DOQs) combining them in a geographic information system (GIS) with other available resources and processing them for input into turnkey decision support systems. The product of this study will be a set of prototype decision support modules.\n\nThis project phase will concentrate on:\n\nDeveloping multi-use land use and land cover categories \nAutomating capture of land use and land cover information from DOQs and other photographic sources. \nIntegrating the derived land use information into a multi-objective, multi-criteria, GIS-based decision support system for non-technical users. \nDeveloping prototype modules for land planing, stormwater management and depiction of the time series.",

        "abstract": "Not Available Phase I research proved the feasibility of EnerTech's Slurry Carbonization technology for economically producing clean and marketable fuels from high-moisture agricultural residues and wastes, especially animal manures. The Slury Carbonization technology effectively transformed low-grade animal residues, through a moderate temperature and pressure carbonization process, into a uniform and especially salt-free pumpable slurry fuel with a heating value substantially higher than the raw waste. The specific objectives of determining the fuel characteristics of the product carbonized slurry fuel versus the feed material (animal waste) and the process conditions were achieved during Phase I. The overall objective of Phase II is to develop design data for a commercial-scale plant. The specific Phase II objectives and work plan have been structured to provide the technical information necessary for scale-up, including combustion experiments to further characterize trace emissions and ash generated. It is anticipated that Phase II will establish the EnerTech process as an economically and environmentally desirable method for disposal of pig manure and other similar animal waste. Development work plans have been structured to compile the necessary scientific and engineering data to construct an integrated demonstration facility in Phase III.",

The tasks successfully completed during the Phase 1 effort are as follows: (1) examined the performance requirements of the optical fiber devices and demodulation systems for FT-IR- and fluorescent-based process monitoring systems, (2) fabricated special high-index fiber to operate in the near infrared (NIR) that is compatible with standard fiber optical connection components, (3) designed high-index optical fiber compatible grating fabrication that maintains optical transmission quality in the desired wave-length ranges, (4) designed and fabricated a prototype optical launch system for use with FT-IR systems to monitor epoxy resin cure, (5) designed and fabricated a prototype grating-based optical fiber sensor to monitor resin flow during composite processing, (6) investigated sensor elements for fluorescent applications, (7) designed and constructed cost-effective signal conditioning systems, and (8) demonstrated prototypes at F&S and NIST. The objective of the proposed Phase 2 program is to build upon the success of the Phase 1 effort and produce commercially available cure monitoring instrumentation based on patented F&S technology.",

The F&S optical fiber refractometers are based on patented and patent- pending sensor designs which avoid alignment of multiple bulk optic components in the sensor head, allowing an extremely small sensor element. The small size, high resolution, temperature compensation capability, and ability to multiplex numerous sensors along a single optical fiber, make the Phase I prototype refractometers extremely competitive with existing refractometer instrumentation. Based on the successful results and commercial potential of the Phase I prototype system, F&S has gained the support and interest of a number of food processing companies. Based on on-site demonstration and discussions, all of these companies have expressed interest in evaluating Phase II prototype systems for eventual integration into their manufacturing process. Phase III funding commitments are currently being discussed, and written agreement is anticipated by May 1999.",

        "abstract": "Not Available The ability to measure the hydraulic infiltration and permeability properties of soils and various geotechnical materials is a growing need in science and engineering with the increased emphasis on groundwater quality protection, water conservation, erosion control and other water relevant issues. These measurements have classically been performed on soils using various forms of infiltrometer and permeameter technologies. Examples, include tension infiltrometers and constant head permeameters for measuring hydraulic conductivity under unsaturated and saturated conditions, respectively. Most of these existing instruments provide a constant pressure or tension at the soil interface with the infiltration characteristics measured over time. These existing technologies require a large amount of manual user intervention from a small select group of highly qualified scientific personnel to perform the measurements due to the lack of automated pressure control as well as the absence of embedded interpretation software.\n\nThis SBIR project is undertaking the research and development of an automated infiltrometer design that controls the pressure at the soil interface with high precision at user-settable profiles vs. time. Phase I has demonstrated the feasibility of developing such a product and Phase II will involve the development of the technology. This improved tool offers great flexibility and ease of use.",

Over the past two decades, these benefits have been widely recognized by the electronics industry, as evidenced by the flourishing fields of screen-printed thick-film electronics. Multilayer circuits are now manufactured by the sequential deposition of conductive and resistive paste patterns and the deposition of solder bumps and epoxies to secure precisely mounted components. We propose to apply these advanced screen printing methods to large-area opto-electronic applications. In Phase 1, we demonstrated the feasibility of screen printing three-dimensional optical components on a flexible substrate using electroformed stencils, where feasibility was defined as being able to print fine-pitch 3-D optical features of precise dimension, and being able to print a second set of features over the first without damaging either. In Phase 2, we will develop several precision printing techniques required to demonstrate a multilayer device on a flexible polymer substrate for consumer-electronics display applications.",

Several thousand metric tons of frozen snakeheads are imported annually to supply the existing demand for this fish by the domestic Asian seafood market. The striped snakehead was introduced to the Island of Oahu, Hawaii, in the early 1800s, where a small established population remains. The successfully completed Phase I research established the feasibility of captive snakehead maturation and spawning during the natural spawning season in Hawaii. Previously completed research successfully addresses the constraints of larval and juvenile feed training on artificial diets, and juvenile cannibalism. The proposed Phase II research will focus on improving the consistency of production of hatched snakehead larvae, and on improving the growout performance of snakehead juveniles to market sizes. This will be accomplished by 1) characterizing the annual maturation cycle and determining the effect of water temperature increases; 2) evaluating the quantity, quality and seasonality of spontaneous spawns following the periodic draining of broodstock tanks, and following spawning induction using FDA approved substances; 3) determining the effect of feed type on spawn quality; and 4) evaluating the effects of water temperature, fish density, feed type, and methods of feed application on growout performance from juvenile to market sizes.",

        "abstract": "Not Available Hawai'i's agriculture has been transforming in response to changing world conditions and competitiveness. No longer are sugar and pineapple plantation farming the mainstays of Hawai'i's agricultural economy. The focus now is on diversified and sustainable agriculture, taking place on small to medium size family- farms. These entrepreneurial farmers are providing new opportunities toward increasing theirs, their community's, the state's and the country's economic livelihood.\n\nTaro farming offers these small family-farms competitive advantages and opportunities to exploit the growing domestic taro market, without placing undue marketing pressure upon existing taro farming operations in the state and country. In 1997, the United States taro import market was estimated at $22,896,000 with over 60 million pounds being imported. The domestic demand for taro has increased by over 30 percent since 1993, with the import custom's value more than doubling from its 1993 value of $10.2 million. This proposal is directed at determining the feasibility of various marketing strategies for taro and taro-based value-added products, including import substitution strategies.

Recent programs have involved application of products such as Malathion to effectively lower insect populations in the infected areas. Concerns about adverse health effects from exposure to Malathion and other toxic bait products have been raised by government agencies. USDA and APHIS are currently seeking alternatives that produce less risk to public health and the environment. RIFA control studies were conducted at Clemson University and Texas A&M using formulations that contained Phloxine B and Uranine as the active ingredients. The formulations were shown to be comparable in efficacy to the leading consumer brand (AMDRO\u00bf, manufactured by American Cyanamid). The proposed program is directed at developing a fire ant product using photo-active dyes as the insecticide and to conduct safety and clinical studies, perform efficacy studies, and registration with the EPA for commercial distribution.",

        "abstract": "The Species-Selective Penning Gauge is used in fusion reactors to measure helium and tritium concentrations. However, when used in certain situations, such as in high performance divertors, the optical emission signals saturate when the pressure becomes too high. The use of differential pumping is not only an undesirable solution in tritium applications; it is also unacceptable in plasma processing due to high effluent reprocessing costs. This project will attempt to overcome the saturation limit by investigating changes in geometry, cathode material, anode potential, and/or magnetic field of the Penning gauge tube. Once an effective combination of changes is determined, a commercially feasible device will be developed and tested. In Phase I, all feasible changes to the Penning tube parameters (or combinations thereof) were tried and tested under different hydrogen/helium concentrations. An operational regime was found that allows non-saturated operation for at least one order of magnitude 'above the present (-5mTorr) limit. In Phase II,the newly found operational mode will be developed into a commercially sound prototype. With the prototype diagnostic at hand, the new limits for fusion applications will be explored and the compatibility with plasma processing applications will be examined. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The enhanced species-selective gauge should be substantially less costly and more robust than a mass spectrometer. In industrial applications, it should be cost effective to use the gauge in large .numbers, not only for process control but also for pollution control by monitoring all possible effluents. ",

Ideally, this test should be simple to perform and interpret, be low cost, and be a sensitive and specific method for rapid detection of pathogenic E. coli 0157:H7. Methods will be developed for the detection of viable E. coli 0157:H7 contamination of meat carcass or ground beef. This consists of specimen collection from these materials, extraction and capture of 0157:H7 RNA, isothermal amplification, and visual lateral flow detection.

Phase II will develop, test, and assess the marketability of components/prototype System in Phase I states (Idaho, Massachusetts, Nebraska, Virginia) adding Texas and West Virginia to test product acceptability in other rural communities. Components of the System include: 1) Toll-free telephone to lessen rural care provider isolation through increased access to problem-solving; 2) Hard copy interactive newsletter for rural care providers not having convenient access to computers; 3) Internet web page for bulletin board announcements, one page fact sheets, interactive newsletter, and short training courses; 4) Two training videos for agencies or care provider self-training, with continuing education hours for satisfactory completion of accompanying evaluation; 5) Database to monitor utilization and satisfaction records for System components as a service to agencies and care providers; 6) Comprehensive system to be promoted nationally as well as in six pilot states. INTERgeneration LINKS products and services could lead to improved instruction and access to training in Adult Family/Foster Care Programs for rural America.",

        "abstract": "Not Available Aquaculture is increasing at an annual rate of 20% and has become a $1 billion industry in the U.S. that provides more than 25% of our seafood supplies. Due to limited water supplies, future aquaculture development will probably involve closed systems in which the culture water is treated and recycled. Current recycling technologies are based on industrial waste treatment methods, but aquaculture facilities require less expensive methods and a much higher degree of treatment.\n\nWe will evaluate an advanced concept for closed system aquaculture in which fish are held at high densities in intensive raceways or tanks, while a large fraction of the culture water is cycled through a series of extensive ponds for water treatment. This Pondway concept combines university research efforts of scientists a Clemson University with private industry research at Aquatic systems. The concept may result in more efficient production at lower costs because the culturist can control the fishes' environment, accelerate growth rates, supplement oxygen levels, maximize feeding , and treat diseases in the intensive sections, while also reducing water treatment costs in the pond sections. Without fish present, the pond section scan be managed solely to treat water and a 300-600% increase in water treatment capacity appears possible.",

        "abstract": "Not Available Today's manufacturing companies are concentrating their energy towards breaking the barriers between firms all along the supply chain to create a virtual enterprise whose goal is to operate as if the chain was a single entity. Breaking these barriers involves facilitating collaboration and communication at all levels of the enterprise. A key roadblock to this sort of facilitation is the need for a computer system interoperability that enables manufacturers and product suppliers to move and share information up and down the supply chain. \n\nIn this project, we propose to implement a framework for developing and maintaining an information translator for the entire supply chain. The translators generated by the framework will not only enable the exchange of properly formatted data, but will take into account the meaning of data during the translation. The key innovations of this project are: (1) the use of ontologies to enable information translation, (2) foundations for ontology harmonization, (3) semantic translation through inferences, and (4) automated generation and management of translators. The technology developed in this project will enable companies to cost- and time-effectively integrate their ERP and ERM systems with their suppliers' stand-alone software applications.",

        "abstract": "Not Available The infestation of crawling insect vermin can cause severe economic losses in citrus and other fruit and nut trees, nursery stock and ornamentals. The red imported fire ants (RIFA) in particular are responsible for damage and death of young citrus tree in the major U.S. citrus growing regions. RIFA freed on bark and cambium to obtain sap, girdling and often killing trees. Fire ants and other ants also tend a number of homopteran insects which can act as vectors for plant diseases. They will also frequently attack beneficial biocontrol organisms that prey on these homopteran insects.\n\nIn the Phase I study, the TreeGuard protected young citrus trees from degradation by these ants and related pests for 18 months. Based on these results, this innovative application technology shows enormous commercial potential and will provide a more effective, economical and environmentally-acceptable solution than many currently used pest control methods. The Phase II research will focus on wide-scale field testing with young citrus trees under practical conditions in the major U.S. citrus-growing regions and evaluate TreeGuard's efficacy in other agricultural applications. Following Phase II testing, final enhancements will be made to prepare the TreeGuard for commercialization and high volume production in Phase III.",

        "abstract": "Not Available In Phase I, a new family water-borne latex dispersions were prepared that incorporate the sugar ?dextrose' from corn. Targeting at a minimum the performance of conventional synthetics, these new sugar based polymers have important environmental benefits: they are recycling-friendly, incorporate an annually renewable resource, and contain no volatile organic compounds (VOC's). The sugar is first modified to provide a reactive ?sugar macromer', which is then copolymerized with vinyl monomers, to provide the new sugar based copolymers.\n\nWe have demonstrated in Phase I that these new copolymers are particulary suitable as pressure sensitive adhesives (PSA) products used for label and lamination applications. The objective of Phase II is to perform engineering scale-up of both the sugar macromer and its copolymers, and to optimize their PSA performance. The process will be scaled-up to provide experimental grades of these new sugar based adhesives up to 50,000 lb/yr. In additional to process development data, the pilot plant would provide the quantities of experimental polymers required for large-scale formulation and sampling to adhesive end- users. Detailed process engineering and economics, including sensitivity analysis, will be performed. In addition, the preliminary data on repulpability testing will be followed up with larger scale pilot trials.",

Mainstream's solid-solid hybrid gas generator technology will result in the delivery of chemical extinguishing agents to the fire in addition to the inert gas agents. This technology has several advantages over state-of-the art gas generator fire suppression technology. First, the system will be significantly smaller and lighter than current gas generator systems because it results in chemical, in addition to physical, extinguishment of the fire. Second, the entire hybrid gas generator material is stored in a single storage vessel as a solid, compared to other hybrid systems which require a separate pressure storage vessel. Third, the hybrid gas generator material has acceptable atmospheric and toxicological properties, unlike other hybrid gas generator systems that use the agents HFC-227ea., HFC-236FA, or CF3I.",

        "abstract": "Not Available The objective of this research project is the development of an Autonomous Microbial Sampler (AMS) that\nwill obtain uncontaminated and exogenous DNA-free microbial samples from deep-sea hydrothermal vents\nand other aquatic ecosystems. Sampling with the AMS may be conducted using manned submersibles,\nRemotely Operated Vehicles (ROV), Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) or during hydrocast\noperations on ships. The modular device consists of a titanium sample nozzle for sampling potentially hot\nsamples (-250 C) and fluid handling components housed within a stainless steel frame for collection of six\nindependent filtered or unfiltered samples. An on board microcomputer permits sampling to be controlled by\nthe investigator, external devices (e.g. AUV computer) or internal programming. Temperature, volume\npumped and other parameters are recorded during sampling. Detailed engineering design of the device and\nchoice of construction of a prototype AMS, and a program of thorough laboratory and field testing of it\u00bfs\noperation. Minor design changes based on testing results will be incorporated into the device. Field testing\nwill be conducted during an upcoming R/V Atlantis/DSV Alvin cruise to a deep water hydrothermal vent site\noff the U.S. or Mexican West coast in spring 2000. Test hydrocast water column sampling will be\nconducted during an R/V Endeavor cruise to the Sargasso Sea in spring 2001.",

        "abstract": "Not Available It is proposed to develop an advanced field apparatus for measuring the thermal conductivity of ceramic powders over the range of temperatures from room temperature to 1500 to 2500 K, depending upon the particular material and its compatibility with other materials. The apparatus will have the capability to carry out fully automated thermal conductivity measurements, by transient or steady-state means, under controlled gaseous environments and will be equipped with associated software to compute the thermal conductivity of the ceramic particle material from the data taken on powders. The specific objectives of the Phase 2 effort are: finalize the design of the prototype field apparatus for determination of the thermal conductivity of ceramic powders of mixtures, including construction drawings and selection of all instrumentation; develop software for experimental control, data acquisition, and data analysis for the prototype field thermal conductivity apparatus; further review available correlations and models relating the thermal conductivity of powders and mixtures to the properties of their constituents, and write appropriate software for use with the prototype field thermal conductivity apparatus; and build and test the prototype field thermal conductivity apparatus.",

        "abstract": "Not Available This project develops and demonstrates an innovative and economic technology that uses ultrasonic energy\nto destroy organisms in a ship ballast system, thereby minimizing impact from alien species introduced\nfrom shipping. Phase 1 results successfully showed that organisms were rapidly destroyed by ultrasound\nat various frequencies and power densities. Although the mechanism of destruction in an ultrasonic bath is\ntypically believed to be cavitation, results indicate that extremely high acceleration forces experienced by\nsmall particles in an ultrasound field create the primary mechanism of damage. Forces (on the order of\n1000's of G\u00c2\u00bfs) cause individual organisms, or parts of an organism, to vibrate in resonance with sonic field,\nliterally ripping the organisms apart. Phase 2 efforts will build on Phase 1 successes to design and build a\nfull-scale prototype Shipboard Ultrasonic Ballast Water Organism Control (SUBWOC) system, which will\ninclude a ten-foot long section of pipe sheathed in piezo-ceramic ring sound transducers. Tasks include\ndesign and fabrication of the SUBWOC, bench testing and lab testing with 300-gallons of known organism\ncultures. Thereafter, sea trials will occur aboard commercial vessels by our Industry Partners, including\nMason Navigation Company and Sause Brother\u00c2\u00bfs Tug & Barge.",

The approach consists of: (1) fabricating integrated circuit wafers containing vibration sensor precursors and signal processing electronics at a commercial Application-Specific Integrated-Circuit (ASIC) foundry service in a completely standard CMOS process; (2) processing the completed wafers to convert the sensor precursors into functional sensors on dies suitable for postmolded-plastic (PMP) packaging; and (3) packaging the dies at a commercial PMP packaging service. Sensor system protyping will be carried out with low-cost multi-project wafer runs and a full-wafer layout will be designed when prototyping is completed. Low-cost test wafers that simulate the sensor-wafer layout will be fabricated and run through steps 2 and 3 to verify that they are working properly. Then a small batch of full wafers will be run through steps 1, 2, and 3. The results will be somewhere between 10,000 and 40,000 single-chip demonstration vibration-sensor systems for testing by potential customers for custom systems.",

High technology vermicomposting systems can convert such wastes into valuable horticultural growth media or soil amendments. The value of these to the horticultural industry was demonstrated clearly in Phase I research. The Oregon Soil Corporation has operated a continuous flow reactor that will process 1000 tons of waste a year for six years.\n\nOregon Soil Corporation proposes the following research in Phase II.\n\nImprovements of the high technology reactor design, operation and efficiency. \nAssessment and minimization of human pathogen, plant disease and weed seed carry-over during the vermicomposting process. \nField plant growth trails of annual and perennial crops to ascertain optimum rates of addition and placement of vermicomposts for field crops. \nObtaining maximum economic returns from vermicomposts. \nQuality standards for vermicomposts to maintain minimum product variability. \nFormulation, processing and amending vermicomposts for marketing. \nMarket survey to identify major profitable outlets for sale of vermicomposts. \nDuring Phase II research, Oregon Soil Corporation plans to build two more reactors for its own operations and supply reactors to five commercial organizations who have agreed to adopt the technology.",

        "abstract": "Not Available The goal of the proposed work is to develop a novel detector for analytical spectrometry having large active area, high-energy resolution and capable of operating at high counting rates. The proposed detector will be specifically designed for x-ray microanalysis to provide orders of magnitude advancement in the performance over conventional energy dispersive systems. During the Phase 1 effort of this project, we successfully designed, fabricated, and demonstrated a ~2cm2 silicon drift detector (SDD) array. All of the goals of Phase 1 were met, and most were significantly exceeded. Accomplishments included development of a closely spaced array of four 0.5 cm2 SDD elements. Energy resolution of 143 eV FWHM at 5.9 keV was achieved on the best device. All four devices produced energy resolution below 200 eV FWHM. Importantly, these results were obtained at relatively short peaking times and additionally the detectors do not require cryogenic cooling to obtain this performance. \n\nIn Phase 2, we will develop a prototype x-ray spectrometer for insertion into an electron microscope. The prototype will include the finalized detector array of up to four elements based upon the Phase 1 study. Each element will be capable of attaining electronic noise of ",

        "abstract": "Not Available The objective is to develop a horizontal ADCP (HADCP) for mapping horizontal flow structure in channels,\nharbors, and ports. This would be useful in areas where currents pose a threat to safe boat navigation. The\nChallenge for such a system is to measure flow even though bottom and surface returns could contaminate\nthe profiles. Phase 2 will develop a long range HADCP using a frequency of approximately 150kHz. The\nHADCP must possess three critical features. First of all, the unit should be modestly priced. In situations\nwhere a single unit is sufficient, only one need be purchased. In more difficult regions, multiple units will\nstill be very competitive with other higher cost technologies(such as the phased array sonar developed by\nJapan). Secondly, the unit must have low side lobes. Thirdly, it is vital to implement the signal processing\nalgorithms developed during Phase 1 into the firmware of the sonar to enable real-time data quality\nassessment.",

        "abstract": "Not Available Zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) of the C2-H2 class are DNA-binding proteins that are ubiquitous in nature. By modifying the amino acids of the recognition helices according to a recently devised recognition code, ZFP's can be designed to bind DNA sequences of choice. This development has made possible the construction of chimeric transcription repressors and activators for regulating genes in plants. We propose to use this emerging technology to alter fatty acid desaturation in both a model system and commercially relevant crop species. In Phase I, we successfully constructed ZFPs capable of recognizing target sequences in a fatty acid desaturase gene of soybean (Glycine max). The custom DNA binding proteins were produced in E. coli and shown to bind to their corresponding target sequences with nanomolar affinities. In Phase II, a second set of ZFPs will be designed for the Arabidopsis version of the desaturase gene. The ZFPs will be optimized for enhanced binding affinity and specificity, they will be inserted into plant expression vectors, and the resulting constructs will be tested in cell culture and whole plants. Success will constitute proof-of-principle for the use of designed ZFPs as a method to alter the expression of genes in plants",

        "abstract": "Not Available Workflow management systems (WMS) may control access between hundreds of users and thousands of objects, so simplified policy management is critical. WMS developers recommend Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) since roles occur naturally in workflows; however, the typical RBAC model lacks the framework to express workflow policies adequately. \n\nTraditionally, a WMS mediates accesses to objects in its workflows. As workflow technology grows in popularity, workflows eventually may control distributed objects such as managed by CORBA and COM/DCOM. Protections must be added to these objects to prevent users from circumventing the WMS and accessing the objects directly. \n\nWe propose the Workflow Policy Server (WPS) to address these challenges. The WPS simplifies workflow policy management with a powerful RBAC Model that has been extended with workflow concepts. In particular, the concept of a workflow task or 'step' has been added. Distributed objects are protected because the WPS can push out the access control policy for a specific stop when directed. The WPS translates the step's policy into the enforcement language of the target object manager.",

Consumers are frustrated that produce items look inviting at the retail store or farmer's market, yet do not maintain quality for an acceptable time once in the home. They are further frustrated by their knowledge that packers and shippers have access to advanced technology for post-harvest storage, and yet little of that technology is available to homeowners. If advanced-technology consumer appliances were available, then one might reasonably expect that consumption of fresh produce would increase and consumer satisfaction with fruit and vegetable quality would improve. It is the object of this Phase II project to resolve outstanding research questions related to 1) optimal conditions for storing common commodities at the consumer level, including refinement of consumer definitions of quality, 2) development of a natural language - fuzzy logic human interface, 3) evaluation and selection of an environmental and quality assessment sensor set, including control algorithms, and 4) integration of biology, consumer control and sensor information into an engineering prototype.",

A major problem for the European starch potato industry is the high levels of glycoalkaloids concentrated in the potato waste stream. Traditionally this potato waste is fed to animals, but the high levels of glycoalkaloids in the waste solids reduces their usefulness as fodder. Potato breeders world-wide have problems with high levels of glycoalkaloids, because they are often associated with desirable traits. The proposed program will create transgenic potatoes, using an antisense gene to inhibit the biosynthesis of glycoalkaloids. This technology has the potential to eliminate the problems of high glycoalkaloids in potato tubers.",

MIDAS will include search and retrieval programming and highly organized variable-level and study-level links to several thousand pages of supporting documentation, e.g., original instruments, codebooks, User's Guides, and methodology reports. An integrated javascript interface will allow users to quickly, easily, and inexpensively interact with the system through Java-enabled Internet browsers. Online data analytic procedures will include weighted and unweighted frequencies, percentiles, and measures of dispersion and central tendency, as well as two-way and n-way tables with measures of association, comparison of means (2-group and ANOVA) and correlations, and the calculation of complex variance estimations. Users will be able to define case subsets, recodes, of aggregations for analysis, and them produce output which can be downloaded or printed. Custom dataset download will also be available. MIDAS will include a fast statistical engine, state-of-the-art interface, and \"portable document format\" files to ensure data analytic speed and comprehensive usability. MIDAS will be integrated with many Socionet features, e.g., Verity search and secure commercial transactions. Beta test panels will be used to assess and improve all features. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The commercial viability of the Multivariate Interactive Data Analysis System is based on evidence of: [1] current demand for Sociometrics' data and instrument archive products; [2] increased interest in online data analysis, [3] low levels of current competition, and [4] the size of institutional target markets, such as health and social science-oriented academic departments, libraries, and research organizations, which total several hundred thousand researchers, teachers, students, reference staff, and others interested in easy-to-use, customizable, online queries of national health and social science statistical resources.

The Institute will link research and practice in the development, implementation, and evaluation of teen pregnancy prevention and teen STD/HIV/AIDS prevention programs. A professional development certificate in Program Development and Evaluation will be offered to individuals who take a specified curriculum. Phase I developed the Institute's curriculum and prototype course materials with input from a Practitioner Advisory Panel consisting of 15 representatives of the target market: teachers, directors and staff members of community-based organizations, family planning/managed care clinic-based practitioners, and program evaluators. Phase I also demonstrated the feasibility of the Institute's granting participants continuing education unit (CEU) and other professional credits useful for job advancement. The Institute course material will be developed and field tested in Phase II. Recognizing the diversity of individual learning styles and the varying time and funding available to the nation's teachers and practitioners, the IPDE will be offered in several formats. One will be in-person workshops and courses held during the summer at a university near Sociometrics' office (Stanford) and at annual meetings of relevant professional organizations. The other will be a correspondence course program, in which practitioners can go over the training curricula and materials in their own homes, schools, or offices, and obtain continuing education credit by passing brief examinations. The correspondence course materials will consist of user's choice of either a printed guidebook, access to on-line course material on the Internet, or an interactive CD-ROM. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Unmarried pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease among adolescents are problems of national concern. Many pregnancy and STD/HIV/AIDS prevention programs, with a variety of approaches and assumptions, have been developed and implemented. The formal training to be provided by the proposed Institute will encourage ongoing scientific evaluation of these programs to ascertain the robustness of each program's effectiveness (or lack thereof) across different study populations. National concern with the problems addressed by the Institute suggests a widespread demand for the Institute. ",

Southern Son Propagation Systems, Inc. (SoSun) has acquired exclusive license from Clemson University to manufacture AcclimatronTM Systems and to market them by specific plant genera to licensed growers. Under support of a SBIR Phase I grant, SoSun and Clemson University have established that plant growth in the AcclimatronTM System is enhanced by CO2 enrichment. Since the enclosed AcclimatronTM atmosphere is temperature-maintained even during high daytime temperatures, plant units, called CU-StartsTM, inside the AcclimatronTM receive the benefit of CO2 enrichment conditions resulted in dry matter accumulations for Hosta ?Newberry' Gold up to twice that of plants grown under ambient CO2 levels. An interactive effect of CO2 level with natural sunlight levels was observed. For optimal utilization of the AcclimatronTM, the next steps for research and development include efforts (1) to quantify the interactive effects of CO2 with variability of natural sunlight, (2) to design a more user-friendly, CO2- enriched AcclimatronTM, and (3) to test additional, economically attractive plant genera.",

        "abstract": "Not Available During our Phase I efforts critical questions were answered and several techniques developed, enabling us to foresee a commercially viable clam aquaculture industry. The primary objective of our research during Phase II will be to continue developing the tools realized during Phase I feasibility trails. The overall goal remains to develop the necessary techniques to successful farm the soft-shell clam, Mya arenaria. To accomplish this objective, our efforts will be focused on hatchery and Floating Upweller System (FLUPSY) optimization, long-term grow-out investigations, and comparisons of several alternate grow-out strategies.\n\nTo accomplish this the project proposes to 1) Optimize hatchery operations, by performing temperature studies, and evaluating larval nutrition; 2) Optimize FLUPSY operations by, evaluating initial stocking density and flow rate; 3) Determine long-term grow-out strategies by evaluating initial planting density vs. growth and survival; comparing initial planting size vs. survival; and determining what factors make a growing area viable for planting; 4) Compare alternate grow-out strategies vs. natural environment by evaluating land-based grow-out vs. field planting and assessing contained FLUPSY grow-out.",

        "abstract": "Not Available This program would further investigate the use of microencapsulated water and PCM materials to regulate the phyllosphere microclimate on plants for mycoherbicides (biological herbicides). The targeted mycoherbicide will be Colletotrichum malvarum on prickly sida (Sida spinosa). Phase I results demonstrated that microH2O and microPCM capsules could enhance moisture and temperature conditions on plant surfaces and provide more optimum environments for mycoherbicides. During Phase II, we would: (a) optimize microH2O capsules for mycoherbicide(s); (b) optimize paraffinic microPCM(s) for mycoherbicides; (c) determine application rates and volume(s) of microencapsulated materials in the field; (d) determine the best spray delivery carriers fluids and systems for the field; (e) determine effect(s) of natural light (UV) on field degradation of materials; (f) determine effect(s) of microencapsulated materials on crop plants; (g) determine effect(s) of microencapsulated materials on phyllosphere microflora populations (h) use more specific and accurate methods to measure temperature and moisture on plant surface(s); (i) conduct host range analysis of materials; (j) determine environmental impact of microencapsulated materials; (k) assess packaging and storage of the microcapsules with mycoherbicides; and (1) study economics for large-scale use of microencapsulated materials. By the end of the proposed effort, this technology should be sufficiently developed to expedite its application.",

        "abstract": "Not Available Bacterial pathogens in salmonids, such as Renibacterium salmoninarum and Aeromonas salmonicida, are\ndifficult to identify by conventional diagnosis due to their extremely slow growth and the absence of an\nefficient selective medium. Diseases caused by these pathogens represent a serious problem both in the\nfishing industry and for conservation efforts. While several PCR-based assays appear to be useful, they are\ngenerally complex laboratory procedures and not suitable for large scale screening. We have proposed to\ndevelop a novel screening method, the \u00c2\u00bfDouble Capture Amplification System\u00c2\u00bf (DCAS), to detect R.\nsalmoninarum in salmonids. This procedure combines several powerful molecular biology tools in an\ninnovative manner to develop a rapid, non-lethal, highly sensitive assay kit. Our Phase 1 research has\ndemonstrated the feasibility of the proposed assay and initiated development of the prototype diagnostic kit.\nThe major goals for the second phase of this project are to adapt, and optimize the assay for the detection\nof Renibacterium salmoninarum in various tissues in fish, determine the sensitivity and specificity of the\nassay, and begin production and quality control testing of the survey kits. In addition, we will initiate\nstudies for the adaptation of DCAS to other organisms such as Aeromonas salmonicida.",

        "abstract": "This project will develop a small, low power instrumentation package which includes a two part sensor suite: 1) sensor for monitoring profiles of moisture content, and 2) sensor to detect O2 concentration in porous substrate nutrient and water delivery systems designed to support plant growth in space. Long-term plant growth experiments aboard the Mir Orbital Station have demonstrated that management of water and O2 in porous substrates is substantially more difficult than in similar systems on earth. The instrument package will consist of several pairs of moisture-oxygen sensors used to measure concentration profiles simultaneously. The substrate moisture content sensor will use the thermal pulse method, which detects changes in thermal conductivity as the substrate moisture content changes. Significant innovations exist in the concept and design of each sensor as well as the integration of the sensor into a usable electronics module with calibrated control. Innovative improvements in moisture sensor construction, reliability, and improved sensor design will allow calibration transfer from earth to microgravity. The companion O2 concentration sensor will monitor O2 in close proximity to the moisture content sensor to allow the two profiles to be compared simultaneously. The innovative design of the O2 sensor includes features permitting the miniaturization of an existing commercial sensor core to provide safe use in wet, O2 diffusion limited environments.",

        "abstract": "Creare proposes an innovative design for audio command, control, and communication systems. The Creare auditory system employs active noise reduction (ANR) that will reduce the harmful effects of high noise levels on personnel while simultaneously enhancing the speech intelligibility of electronic messages. Currently-available, off-the-shelf ANR audio systems provide between 10-20 dB of noise reduction for frequencies between 0.1 and 1kHz. The feedback alforithm they employ attenuates injected electronic messages as well as unwanted environmental noise and the feedback algorithm actually adds noise above 1 kHz. The Creare innovation uses a feedforward controller, which provides the ability to reduce noise by 30-40 dB over a wide electronic messages that are unaffected by the ANR algorithm. This approach will enhance audio command, control, and communication systems. During Phase I, we conclusively proved the feasibility of our innovation by conducting a system engineering analysis of the design, developing the feedforward algorithm, and fabricating and testing a laboratory bench top system. In Phase II, we will optimize the design, fabricate prototypes of the optimized design, and perform laboratory and field tests of the prototype units to verfy compliance with desired specifications.

        "abstract": "Current military aircraft oxygen supply systems are suboptimal in that they require a great deal of logistical support, do not provide a sufficient oxygen purity level for all applications, do not respond well to varying demand, are coupled directly to the engine bleed air supply, and/or present significant safety hazards. Similarly, existing fuel tank inerting systems employing molecular sieves to produce Nitrogen Enriched Air (NEA) do not produce NEA at a sufficient rate or provide for realiable operation. The opportunity is to eliminate the problems associated with these two sybsystems by developing an onboard Total Air Liquefaction System for Oxygen and Nitrogen (TALON). This system consists of a cryogenic refrigerator and two compact, lightweight, flightworthy distillation columns that provide supplies of liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid NEA (LNEA) to several onboard dewars. Through design and hardware demonstrations of the core distillation technology, we have shown that the TALON system potentially provides many benefits to military aircraft. In the proposed Phase II project, we will demonstrate key ancillary elements ofd the proposed system including an innovative method to achieve thermal recoovery critical to efficient operation, a tilt correction scheme, and the LOX/LNEA storage and delivery systems.",

        "abstract": "Catheter ablation has become the treatment of choice for many types of arrhythmias largely because it is curative, safe, and relatively inexpensive. However, due to limited tools for mapping complex arrhythmias, catheter ablation is much less effective when used to treat arrhythmias that are not constrained by known anatomic barries. The goal of this research is development of a novel system for endocardial mapping, one that combines anatomical information provided by fluoroscopic images with functional information provided by intracardiac electrograms. This system will provide clinicians with a powerful tool that will assist them in accurately mapping complex arrhythmias. During Phase I, a prototype version of the system was developed and installed in a clinical setting. The prototype system demonstrated the feasibility of the concept and the primary data processing algorithms. During Phase II, a full-featured, real-time version of the system will be developed and installed in the cardiac electrophysiology laboratory. The clinical utility of the system will be evaluated during a number of arrhythmia mapping procedures and used as a basis for developing a new mapping methodology. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The primary commercial application for this work is in cardiac electrophysiology workstations. The technology developed under this program caould be incorporated in existing workstations or marketed as a stand-alone system.",

        "abstract": "Atrial arrhythmias are extremely common and are often associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The ability to develop and prescribe new treatments for atrial arrhythmias depends on the availability of better diagnostic tools that are simple, inexpensive, and effective enough to support their use for screening large numbers of patients. During Phase I, we developed signal processing algorithms that permit noninvasive assessment of patients suffering from atrial fibrillation. T algorithms were tested on patient data and found to assist clinicians in predicting patient response to cardioversion in an attempt to terminate the arrhythmia and restore sinus rhythm. During Phase II, we will investigate alternate algorithms for identification and classification of atrial arrhythmias. Our goal is development of a tool that will allow the clinician to rapidly identify specific arrhythmias and measure the progress of individual patients through different courses of therapy. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The technology developed under this program could be used in diagnostic devices like electrocardiogram monitors.",
