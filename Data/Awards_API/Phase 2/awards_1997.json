        "abstract": "MATERIAL AND STRUCTURAL DAMPING IS REQUIRED IN MANY APPLICATIONS WHEREIN SUPPRESSION OF UNWANTED DYNAMIC DISPLACEMENTS CAN BE CRITICAL. WHILE ACTIVE CONTROL CAN PROVIDE SUCH SUPPRESSION, THE COMPLEXITY AND COST PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH ACTIVE SYSTEMS REDUCE THEIR ATTRACTIVENESS. PASSIVE MATERIAL AND STRUCTURAL DAMPING CAN PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS. RESEARCHERS ARE IDENTIFYING THE POTENTIALS OF AN INNOVATIVE MECHANISSM FOR INDUCING PASSIVE DAMPING. A CLASSICAL METHOD FOR INDUCING DAMPING IN A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT IS THE USE OF PATCHES OF CONSTRAINED VISCO-ELASTIC MATERIAL (VEM). THE VEM DISSIPATES ENERGY AS IT IS DYNAMICALLY STRESSED. BOTH THE VEM AND THE STRUCTURE ADDED TO INDUCE STRESSES ARE PARASITIC ADDITIONS. THE INNOVATIVE METHOD FOR INDUCING STRESS WITHIN THE CONSTRAINED VEM WHILE RETAINING HIGH STRUCTURAL EFFICIENCY IS ADDRESSED. BY TAILORING THE ELASTIC PROPERTIES OF COMPOSITE STRUCTURAL MATERIALS, STRESS CAN BE INDUCED WITHIN THE VEM TO ENHANCE SYSTEM DAMPING WHILE MAINTAINING REQUIRED STIFFNESS PROPERTIES. THE INNOVATION ALLOWS FOR MULTIPLE VEM LAYERS WITHIN A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT ALLOWING FOR DAMPING OVER EXTENDED FREQUENCY AND TEMPERATURE RANGES. THE RESEARCH ADDRESSES MATERIALS FOR USE IN TRUSS TYPE STRUCTURES, BUT THE INNOVATION CAN BE APPLIED TO A RANGE OF STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMPETITIVE ADVANCES IN NOISE AND VIBRATION CONTROL; E.G., FOR MACHINERY, TRANSPORTATION VEHICLES, CIVIL STRUCTURES, ETC.",

It will reduce mission operations data analysis costs, enhanced the ability of operators to handle the large volume of incoming data, and reduce the likelihood of soft failures being undetected until they cause significant damage to valuable spacecraft components.  It will also be much more cost-effective than expert system or model based systems.  This effort will demonstrate the feasibility of developing vastly superior satellite diagnostic and prognostic systems that:  1. Increase fault detection and isolation well beyond that provided by conventional built-in test (BIT), rule-based expert systems, and model-based systems.  2.  Distinguish and isolate sensor failures from equipment failures.  3.  Estimate system degradation.  4.  Predict an important class of impending failures sufficiently in advance to avoid them.  A major goal is to enable STAR to be implemented so inexpensively for the value offered that it will quickly become popular on many different satellites.|  Benefits:  This technology can be used in monitoring commercial satellites, instruments in hospital intensive care units, machines in factories, and numerous other aerospace, healthcare, and manufacturing applications.|",

        "abstract": "A low risk, low cost, classical design observation vehicle will be developed for gull launching.  The observation vehicle concept is based on a light-weight loitering aircraft, packaged in a \"shell\" that will enable the aircraft to survive the large acceleration/deceler- ation loads associated with gun launch systems.  The shell encasing the observation aircraft and avionics payload is designed to carry the required 15,000 g impulsive launch acceleration, the 7,000 g rebound acceleration, and the very high initial flight dynamic pressure (10,000 psi).  For these large loads, the projectile/shell casing is relatively heavy, and the casing requires disposal to ensure the loitering observation aircraft weight is as light as possible.  Thus, the proposed aircraft, to be designed for minimum weight, will fly at low dynamic pressure (approximately 10 to 20 psf).  However, the minimum launch trajectory dynamic pressure is approximately 500 psE Therefore, the conceptual aircraft should have a parachute or some other large drag producing device to decelerate the projectile shell and aircraft combination to acceptable flight speeds (10 to 20 psf) prior to disca rding the shell casing and prior to deployment of the aircraft wings, tails, and propulsion propeller for low speed loitering flight.",

        "abstract": "Herein ACX proposes a damage detection system based on ACX's QuickPack+ technology to combine piezoelectric actuators and sensors in a robust, easily mounted transducer package.  The QuickPack encapsulates a piezoceramic with insulating flex circuit material and a simple connector.  The transducer package will be bonded via a low-melting-point thermoplastic adhesive to ensure \tremovability.  The transducer package excites the structure and measures its vibration response.  A system identification algorithm reduces the transfer function data to structural parameters.  Isolation of the location and size of a flaw will be accomplished by comparing these structural parameters to base-line parameters of a healthy structure and to a reference finite element model (FEM).  Phase I development will focus on assessing the feasibility of the proposed system and fabricating and testing a prototype version.  A method of temporarily attaching the transducer package will be investigated.  Transducer packages will be designed and fabricated, as will 18\" by 18\" thick-walled test plates.  The base-line structural parameters of the \"healthy\" test plates will be identified with the transducer package.  Plates with some degree of pre-determined delamination damage will be instrumented and frequency response data will be collected.  The damage detection algorithm will then attempt to localize and size the delamination damage of the samples.  By meeting these objectives, ACX will demonstrate the feasibility of a damage detection method based on surface mounted piezoelectrics.  The sensitivity and ease-of-use of such a system will have been established.  An easy to use, cost-effective, non destructive damage detection system for thick composite structures is applicable to all composite structure materials and fabrication methods.  Catastrophic in-service failures of mission-critical, high-load composite structures will be reduced through the use of such a system.  In addition, the system has the potential to be a cost-effective, integrated, in-service, composite structure health monitoring device with far-reaching potential.",

        "abstract": "Significant deficiencies exist in the laser source technology for IRCM, specifically in the limited pulse rep-rate capability, limited average power output and capability to be  transitioned to military environments.  We propose a novel tandem OPO concept that uses two noncritical phasematched OPO's in KTA and AgGaSe(2) to generate the desired three output wavelength bands simultaneously. This concept uses existing materials where they have their best transmission characteristics to minimize bulk absorption and resulting thermally induced dephasing.  Noncritical phasematching (NCPM) eliminates walkoff and makes conversion of small pulse energies practical.  Obtaining efficient conversion with the IRCM pulse format is critical to making such systems meet size/weight constraints.  NCPM also enables the use of relatively high divergence pump beams.  This potentially enables the use of crossed porro-prism resonator designs like those used in all current military lasers, making reliable operation of the laser in the field a possibility.  The phase I program will demonstrate the capability of a NCPM KTA OPO being used to pump the NCPM AgGaSe(2) OPO and will demonstrate over 1 watt output and Band IV at 10 kHz.",

A new nonlinear material, periodic poled Lithium Niobate (PPLN) enables an OPO to efficiently convert low energy pulses (150 microjoules) into the mid-infrared wavelengths.  By changing the poling spacing, tunable output can be obtained.  PPLN is a novel new OPO nonlinear material that can provide a higher level of performance otherwise not possible with conventional nonlinear crystals. The Phase I effort will attempt to demonstrate > 2 kW peak power pulses through the range of wavelengths from 1.5 to 3.5 microns.  Research will also be conducted to evaluate PPLN OPO performance at 4.5 microns where the exists significant bulk absorption.",

        "abstract": "CW mid-IR sources, capable of delivering 5 Watts of average power,   are required in the 2-5 micron range for IR counter measures.  To   date, solid state laser approaches have been limited to less than   1-2 Watts of average power due to absorption and adverse thermal   effects in the nonlinear materials.  Our approach to solving this   problem is to use a relatively new nonlinear material, bulk   periodically poled LiNbO3 (PPLN), as the converter for a   conventional cw Nd:YAG pump laser source.  The innovation in this   work includes: (1) the use of two PPLN OPO devices in series, a   \"tandem\" OPO, capable of delivering wavelengths in all three   optical bands of interest, simultaneously; (2) PPLN operated at   these wavelengths has an extremely wide angular and temperature   acceptance that makes it relatively insensitive to problems   encountered with other materials such as AgGaSe2; (3) PPLN has   extremely large nonlinear gain that makes it possible to extract   significant idler power in the presence of large idler absorption,   30o/ocm.  Aculight has developed an OPO model for PPLN operated   with large idler absorption that predicts >5 Watts of 4.5 micron   output power with 40 Watts of 1 micron input pump power.  Aculight   will make available a 60 Watt output power cw Nd:YAG pump laser   source with excellent beam quality that will allow testing of   these devices at power levels a factor of 4-5 higher than that   available to date.",

Because they can be made as high polymers, their efficiency for harvesting radiation deposited energy should be high.  This effort will examine those molecular and electronic properties (light yield from radiation excitation, energy capture to their fluorescent state, and self absorption of emitted light) that determine their utility for application to scintillator formulations.

        "abstract": "Two major objectives of the U.S. Army is to increase power density and reduce heat rejection.  Reducing airflow requirements of the deisel engine will contribute toward both of these objectives. Reducing air-fuel ratio requirements is one of the major cost effective approaches available for significantly increasing power output and reducing heat rejection in today's power output diesel engine.  Power output of a diesel engine is determined by the amount of fuel injected which is limited by engine air utilization efficiency and system airflow capabilities. The diesel engine uses excess airflow to overcome the reduced air utilization performance characteristics of the conventional fuel injection system.  The traditional diesel uses nearly twice the airflow theoretically required.  This excess airflow limits the maximum possible power output rating and performance as a result of increased cylinder pressure and increased aftercooling heat rejection.  Maximum allowable cylinder pressures are limited by structural and bearing durability considerations. The traditional excess airflow requirements can be overcome through the use of high pressure fuel injection to improve air utilization. High fuel injection pressures have been used to improve combustion efficiences at traditioanl high airflows and can be extended for increasing power output and reducing airflow requirements.",

The propulsive efficiency of the PDE   hinges on the ability to quickly initiate a detonation in a   fuel/air mixture.  Since most fuel/air mixtures are difficult to   detonate, an easily detonable predetonator mixture is typically   added to the PDE combustor to aid in detonating the fuel/air   mixture.  Current experimental prototypes require a predetonator   volume which is a significant portion of the total combustor volume.   As the predetonator mixture must be carried onboard the vehicle,   this results in a very large decrease in specific impulse compared   to an ideal PDE which uses no predetonator.  The proposed concept   would use an innovative geometry modification to reduce the   predetonator volume by up to an order of magnitude.

        "abstract": "Aircraft landing gear, and wheels in particular, are subjected to   heavy loads during service.  Controlled surface compressive   stresses help to improve the fatigue life by reducing the   probability of crack initiation and propagation from the wheel   surface.  Manufacturers such as Allied Signal will induce a surface   compressive stress by either shot peening or roll burnishing.   Acoustic and magnetic methods for determining stress by either shot   peening or roll burnishing.  Acoustic and magnetic methods for   determining stress are difficult due to numerous microstructure   parameters which alter the propagating wave.  X-ray diffraction   provides a direct measure of the residual strain independent of   other microstructure properties, but is typically limited to the   first 30 um of depth.  Traditional four circle scanning   diffractometers for stress analysis are very slow, and ill suited   for manufacturing environments.  ATMI in collaboration with Proto   Manufacturing, and Allied Signal Aircraft Landing Systems, proposes   to develop a rapid x-ray stress technique capable of rapid depth   dependent stress monitoring.  The technique will utilize a novel   dual (short and long) wavelength z-radiation source applied to an   existing commercial high speed fiber-optic/x-ray stress analyzer   manufactured by Proto.  In Phase II a beta site system will be   tested Allied Signal's manufacturing facility.",

The effort will build on a recently developed stress-strain microprobe (SSM) system which tests minimal material and determines several mechanical properties of metallic structures.  The SSM system utilizes a nondestructive, automated bail indentation (ABI) technique which provides a localized direct measurement of the stress-strain curve at quasi-static strain rates at room temperature.  Phase I will develop testing and analytical procedures for:  (1) ABI testing at high strain rates to compare with dynamic tensile test results and to develop new correlations between dynamic ABI test results and dynamic Charpy impact properties; (2) ABI testing at low and high temperatures (-130oC to 288oC); (3) development of correlations to determine fracture toughness from ABI-measured flow properties, and (4) in-situ testing of steel plates and a section from a commercial RPV (after partial removal of its inner cladding).  In Phase II, numerous ABI tests will be conducted on irradiated materials (mostly from utility surveillance programs) and a new prototype of the SSM testing unit (robotistic for in-situ testing of the areas of most concern inside the beltline region of a commercial RPV) will be developed and manufactured.\n\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  Nuclear applications should include testing of RPVs before and after their postirradiation thermal annealing, vessel supports, core internals, etc.  This will ensure safe operation and avoid premature decommissioning of power plants and other expensive structural components.

Commercial, home, or surveillance video programming captures information in multiple tracks: picture, sound, and closed captioning.  Using multiple modalities cataloging information, visual information, and audio information is critical since no one track contains necessary information to identify clips.  There is a growing market in extraction of relevant features from separate audio or video tracks of video programming.  We will take advantage of these multiple modalities by developing a video library with powerful data fusion capabilities.  Both analog videotape and current digital video services provide only linear access to the program material.  Interactive search provides non-linear access to the library contents, reducing search time and increasing the efficiency of video library users.  We propose to develop search engines allowing complex queries which take advantage of these multiple modalities.  Our project will build on exisiting work in digital video libraries which have developed valuable technology for extracting information from individual tracks.  While we may need to develop some new feature recognition algorithms for video or audio, we plan to emphasize data fusion to maximize the video library's utility and minimize time-to-market.",

        "abstract": "The proposed research combines an innovative eigenvector method with other electromagnetic techniques to produce a hybrid approach towards solving the EM coupling to satellite cavity problem.  The physical structure is divided into an exterior region and one or more interior regions.  The exterior region is modeled with method of moments (MOM) and or hybrids of MOM with the uniform theory of diffraction.  The interior is modeled with an eigenvector analysis.  Since the interior is not perfectly conducting at the aperture(s), the classical eigen analysis is extended to account for coupled, generalized impedance boundary conditions at the aperture.  The impedances are found from the exterior problem solution.  The interior and exterior problems are first formulated in isolation (without coupling), then joined together by a method similar to Householder's Method of Modified Matrices, taken from the Air Force's GEMACS (General Electromagnetic Model for Analysis of Complex Systems) software.  The research will demonstrate the proposed method in one, two, and three dimensions.  The three-dimensional demonstration will be for a rotationally symmetric structure, such as optical telescope.  However, the full three-dimensional theory will be formulated and documented.|  Benefits:  The major benefit of this research is the development of a computationally efficient method for studying electromagnetic coupling to cavities, particularly cavities with electrically large apertures.  This has immediate benefits in satellite and aircraft assessment, but also commercial potential in aerospace and computer industries.|",

The potential for contamination of the collected lubricants, particularly with halogenated compounds such as degreasing solvents or turbine fuels, reduces the effectiveness of a previously developed reclamation process. The innovation is the use of a novel thermal/Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) analysis technique in combination with advanced data analysis methods to develop an on-site, user friendly, low cost, and reliable means of identifying contamination in used turbine engine lubricants. The overall objective of the proposed Phase I program is to demonstrate the feasibility of thermal analysis combined with a multi-mode FT-IR analysis of the gaseous products for identification of contamination of synthetic lubricants. This program would be divided into four specific tasks: 1) sample selection and preparation; 2) analysis studies in a multi-mode thermal/FT-IR instrument; 3) data analysis to determine detectability limits and quantitation of contaminants; 4) assessment of requirements for prototype instrument that would be built and tested under the Phase II program.

To optimize their use, accurate surface temperature measurements are required in order to understand the response of these coatings to changes in the combustion environment.   Present temperature sensors, based on the measurement of emitted electromagnetic radiation, are not well-suited to the turbine application because:  1) operational wavelengths are not optimized for radiative properties; and 2) operational probes are not optimized to survive the high temperature/pressure environment.   In this project, a pyrometer will be constructed with a sensor probe that is optimized for both requirements.   Because advanced coatings exhibit near-blackbody radiative characteristics in the long wavelength infrared (LWIR), sapphire hollow waveguides will be employed, which can survive turbine conditions while directing LWIR radiance to the detector system.

In the proposed program, innovative combustion systems that are flexible and adaptable to a number of fuels will be investigated.

These cells will have rapid startup capability, be insensitive to a wide range of heat sink temperatures, and tolerant of a large number of thermal cycles. Concepts have been developed that allow all of these features to be implemented, as well as the high efficiency and modularity.  The feasibility of the AMTEC cell and the overall concept will be demonstrated.  The cell concept will then be integrated with the combustion system concept and system performance will be calculated.  A development plan will then be prepared.",

These systems operate silently, with no moving parts and can utilize any source capable of delivering heat at 700oC to 900oC.  Because they are light weight and can remain at nearly full efficiency while operating with 'exhaust' temperatures up to 600 K, they can use very compact, low mass, radiator systems in space power applications. These modest radiator requirements also allow AMTEC systems to be adaptable to a wider variety of spacecraft configurations for deep space missions.  This project will develop a Directed Reflectivity Condenser (DRC) that will demonstrate the feasibility of an improved AMTEC condenser component. Phase I will investigate the potential for adding 5% to 7% to the system efficiency. Experimental work will develop a new cell using a DRC and measure its performance. AMTEC analytical models will then be used to determine the utility of using DRC cells in a full scale system.  Phases II and III will demonstrate full scale cell and system performance at the 100+ watt level and show that they can be assembled into units appropriate for use in spacecraft and remote site systems. \n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  As stand-alone modules, the same AMTEC cells that can be assembled into systems for spacecraft can be utilized as modules for residential generators in continuous gas furnaces, for remote power site power, in recreational vehicles, for rural power generation from biomass fuels, and for cathodic protection of pipelines.",

The Phase I technical objectives are to determine the feasibility of directly communicating CT slice data to stereolithography slice data, and evaluate optimum CT-to-stereolithography system integration for building a prototype at the same time that an original component is CT scanned.  The Phase I effort will consist of taking x-ray CT data of a test object, determining different data processing methods to produce stereolithography input files, evaluating the accuracy of stereolithography patterns produced from the input files, and conceptualizing a CT system design compatible with rapid prototyping equipment.

These optics have been used on both synchrotron and laboratory x-ray instruments. However, the main barrier to their useful deployment has been the lack of a reproducible and well-controlled fabrication technique.  This problem will be addressed by building a new furnace for pulling capillaries, which will incorporate novel in-situ metrology sensors to both understand and control the fabrication process.  The in-situ sensors will be installed and used to measure the position and shape of the capillaries, during the pulling process, and to characterize the temperature profile of the furnace. The in-situ measurements will then be correlated with dimensional measurements on the fabricated capillaries, and with gain measurements made on the capillaries using synchrotron radiation.  Phase I will develop and characterize the metrology techniques.  Phase II will use this information to design and implement a process-control scheme to control the fabrication process using real-time feedback from the in-situ metrology sensors.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee: High-brightness x-ray beams, in the range of 1 to 10 microns, and below, would have unique analytical capabilities (for composition, thickness and microstructure) and should serve the strategic interests of the semiconductor and other industries for diagnostic x-ray fluorescence and diffraction analysis.

Cleanup of fuel hydrocarbon   contamination using intrinsic bioremediation has the potential for   substantial cost savings.  Anaerobic biodegradation of organic   chemicals, including benzene and toluene, has been observed in the   lab and the field.  Anaerobic microorganisms, particularly   iron-reducing bacteria (FeRB), play a significant role in intrinsic   bioremediation.  Therefore, accurate quantitation of available iron   with the soil or groundwater is critical for predicting the amount   of fuel hydrocarbons that can be degraded during intrinsic   bioremediation.  Measurement of the amount of available ferric iron   (FE III) for FeRB has been difficult.  The proposed method of   measuring the amount of ferric iron is based on the recognition   that several geochemical factors are critical with respect to iron   bioavailability.  The scientific literature gives many examples of   what these factors are and how they can affect iron   bioavailability.  Iron speciation is only one of several   potentially critical factors.  The proposed exploratory development   is based on 1) determining what these factors are using   cost-effective factorial experimental designs, and 2) developing a   bioassay to quantify bioavailable iron in aquifer materials.

        "abstract": "Bacterial plant diseases of economically important crops are difficult to control.  Chemicals used to treat bacterial plant diseases cannot only alter soil flora and auna, but ar unreliable for preventive control when environmental conditions favor growth of plant pathogenic bacteria.  This research is directed toward development of an effective control for bacterial plant diseases using phages which are specific for their bacterial hosts.  Although the use of phages against bacterial plant pathogens has been proposed in the past, no commercial application has taken place.  This was due largely to the development of mutant bacteria resistant to the controlling phage.  Unlike past uses of a single phage for treatment, this method utilizes a mixture of phages including h- or host-range mutants.  H-mutants, derived by spontaneous mutation of the wild-type parent phages, will attack and kill not only phage-resistant mutants but also wild-type bacteria.  It is proposed that mixtures of phages, containing h-mutants, can be used effectively to control pathogenic bacteria which cause a variety of plant diseases as well as to control ice nucleation.",

        "abstract": "ASRI proposes to design and demonstrate a Phase Signature Antenna Drive Diagnostics System (PSADDS) for incipient fault detection and diagnostics of drive system bearing/gear train components.  The PSADDS utilizes ASRI's innovative Phase Signature Analysis (PSA) techniques developed for the Space Shuttle Main Engine failure detection.  conventional spectrum analysis has been a popular technique for mechanical fault signature identification.  However, under an operation environment with multi-rotational components, vibration signals are often subjected to noise and signal interference which may reduce the diagnostic reliability.  The proposed PSADDS will improve these inherent problems using a hierarchy of novel Phase Signature analysis techniques for anomaly identification.  Phase information can play a significant role for fault diagnostics and can better identify hidden defects.  As a result, the use of PSA techniques will reduce mis-interpretation rates and greatly improve system reliability.  Phase I objectives are to investigate optimal antenna drive component defect signatures through test using PSA and standard techniques to demonstrate the detectability of various types of degradation/failure.  The objective of this  proposed SBIR study will be to build an operational hardware and software system for demonstration and implementation by the end of Phase II and a commercial system for industrial application in Phase III.",

Emission Computer Temography (ECT) can in principal be used to provide a 3-D assessment of the distribution of radioactivity, but each detector technology currently available has shortcomings.  Several wide bandgap compounds semiconductor materials offer the potential for addressing these shortcomings, but their performance is limited by poor transport of the holes.  The project will address this need by fabricating a detector which uses a true Frisch grid, embedded inside the semiconductor device, to produce a signal due to electron transport alone.

Two key features should be present in any comprehensive solution proposed for the wireless inventory problem.  First, the transmitters must be small and inexpensive so they can be used for large numbers of items.  Second, the transmitters should be able to transmit low power packets over a common multiple access communication channel capable of supporting extremely large numbers of transmitters.  We plan to use a variation of the new Spread ALOHA protocol to provide a multople access capability which satisifies both these constraints.  The wireless inventory network will provide high packet throughput for tens of millions of packet transmitters into a single hub station.  The transmitters can be attached or embedded into inventory, supplies and equipment for both tracking and for inventory control.  The WI network designed in Phase I of this SBIR project will be built in Phase II of the project.  Anticipated Benefits:  The wireless inventory network described in this proposal can be used for the continuing procurement, distribution, storage and replacement of material required for the maintenance of military readiness.  It can increase the efficiency and effectiveness of logistical operations for the digital battlefield.  Similar systems can make it practical to operate large scale wireless inventory networks for the automobile industry.",

        "abstract": "As the size of staring sensors increase, the bandwith to move data off the focal plan increases proportional to the number of pixels in the array.  For analog focal planes increased bandwidth also means increased noise.  Readout noise limited systems will be less sensitive, detector noise limited systems may become readout limited at the higher bandwidths.  Power dissipation will also increase with size.  The newly developed MOSAD technology places an A/D/ converter at each pixel limiting noise bandwith to temporal bandwidth, independent of array size.  The converter requires no more surface area than the old analog detector interface it replaces.  Digital at the pixel allows lower switching voltage over analog, reducing power consumption.  The technology can be applied to large focal plane arrays of cooled HgCdTe improving linearity and dynamic range.  Power consuming and noise limited analog electronics can be eliminated from the system, improving reliability and decreasing cost.  This A/D conversion process can be built with existing semiconductor technology.  The technology is also less dependent on device parameters compare to other digital or analog approaches, giving it improved immunity to radiation effects and longer life.|  Benefits:  There is a broad range of systems that can be developed with lower cost digital imagers including:  Safety (aircraft landing, truck collision avoidance), surveillance (law enforcement, assembly line) and earth resources (atmospheric sounders, agricultural).|",

The proposed concept employs the synergistic characteristics of robust control and intelligent control to improve the robot closed-loop servo control system.  Its mechanism possesses three integrated levels of control.  The robust control realizes the lowest (inner loop) level stabilization and slewing control.  The learning control in the middle level is used as a turbocharger to enhance the precision of the servo control loop.  The fuzzy neural network at the highest level merges the knowledge of human experts and input-output data from a multi-sensor platform o provide adaptive operation at capabilities for the robot.  The proposed scheme provides a power technique in supporting the in-process stabilization motion control, decision making, and fault detection and reconfiguration subject to system failures or stressing operating conditions.

        "abstract": "The trend toward replacement of highly toxic chemicals with less hazardous alternatives has created the demand for replacement of chromate conversion coatings for corrosion protection of aluminum alloys. Aluminum alloys are the predominate structural material used in aircraft because of their high strength-to-weight ratios, affordability and processability. Aluminum is subject to catastrophic failure due to stress-corrosion cracking caused by exposure to marine environments. A discovery by the Navy of trivalent chromium conversion coating (TCCC) has been identified as a promising replacement for the chromate process to impart corrosion protection to aluminum aircraft alloys. The TCCC process involves the deposition of a protective coating on the aluminum surface from an aqueous solution of trivalent chromium with additions of Na2SiF6 and NaOH. A post-deposition oxidation treatment with of H202 or KMnO4 improves the coating effectiveness. This TCCC procedure is promising but needs to be optimized before commercialization. American Research Corporation of Virginia proposes four technical objectives to improve the quality of the tccc process. In Phase I of the program, the composition and conditions of the deposition and oxidation steps will be improved, the elemental composition and structure of the films will be examined, corrosion due to salt water exposure will be tested, and the process will be monitored for generation of highly toxic chromates in solution. The significance of the proposed work will be the corrosion protection of aluminum surfaces by an environmentally favorable process.",

Innovative technologies for electronic beam scanning, phase shifting, matrix and spatial beamforming, and multilayer packaging will be developed and evaluated.  The resulting antenna architectures will be evaluated and selected for detailed design.  The design effort will include aperture, phase shifter, beamforming, mechanical, materials and processes, performance prediction and documentation.

However, the utilization of these Bi-2223 composite conductors in applications such as motors and generators (i.e., $3 to $5 billion market) requires significant improvement in their current carrying capabilities in high magnetic field environments at temperatures near 77K.  Recent results have demonstrated that this current carrying capability can be increased 100 fold by the introduction of pinning defects into the Bi-2223 grains through proton irradiation.

This project addresses a key element in filling this need, the design of high power nuclear targets.  The targets will be used for the production of intense radioactive ion beams from high-energy charged particle beams, especially high energy protons, and will yield a broad variety of radioactive species in intensities significantly larger than presently available. The production of isotopes in a vapor form for subsequent mass separation and acceleration will depend on the ability to control target temperature profiles within the target resulting from interactions of the intense production beams with the target material.  Target materials in powder form will be used to expand employment of thermal barriers between the metallic or molten target materials and cooling systems. Actual targets, envisioned for 200-MeV proton irradiation, will be analyzed at target thicknesses corresponding to interaction lengths for the incident beam.  Successful completion of the Phase I effort will lead to the possibility for construction of one or more prototype target(s) to be tested at an existing accelerator facility.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee: This project should provide designs of high-power targets for testing at an existing accelerator facility, allowing for the production of intense radioactive beams.",

        "abstract": "This proposed effort is for an unclassified research and exploratory development program to adapt AI/ES software technologies for the design and demonstration of a smart pre-processor for Computational Electromagnetics (CEM).  Despite their inherent power, most CEM tools can challenge even the most proficient user, let alone the novice.  One method of alleviating difficulties is by adapting AI/ES technologies to establish a user-friendly pre-processor.  This innovative approach employs a knowledge or rule base to assist CEM code users during input modeling tasks, particularly for the detailed definition of geometries, and the automated selection of optimum physics formalisms and numerical solutions.  This will facilitate efficient use of CEM codes and will readily allow a wide range of problems to be addressed.  While it will alleviate the burdensome modeling process often associated with sophisticated CEM codes, it also will establish a foundation for intelligent CEM post-processing.  It will have direct relevance to commercial/private sector applications and will be marketed as a dual-use technology.  To determine the technical feasibility of developing an enhanced capability for various CEM codes in Phase II, Phase I focuses on the design and demonstration of a prototype tool called the Intelligent CEM Expert System (ICEMES) Pre-processor, for the U.S. Air Force code called the General Electromagnetic Model for the Analysis of Complex Systems (GEMACS).  ICEMES will convert CAD system model data into a valid EM structure model, or validate user-created models, and store such in a syntactically-correct input format compatible with GEMACS.",

The errors of integrated GPS/IMU attitude and sightline stabilization systems are determined by simulations of these systems using complete mathematical models of IMUs and GPS receivers. The GPS and IMU models represent the full range of sensor performance plateaus available today. Dynamic motion profiles for aircraft, ships and land vehicles are generated with a 6 degree-of-freedom trajectory generator. Included is a 54 state Kalman filter with time varying dynamics and observation matrices for estimating IMU and GPS errors. The simulator outputs include differences between the navigation system solution using the simulated IMU inputs and the true trajectory results from the trajectory generator. Additional outputs are error estimates and RMS values from the Kalman filter. The sensor performance requirements and costs of integrated GPS/IMU systems are compared to those of implementations without GPS aiding. Summary plots are given that give a very unique and easy method to select the lowest cost IMU and GPS receiver that will meet a desired attitude and sightline system performance requirement.",

This effort seeks to define a test tool and associated fourth generation language (4GL) to support the design, specification, and test of system (machine-machine) interfaces. The proposed multi-purpose, reconfigurable communications test suite will be capable of simultaneous simulation/stimulation of multiple interfaces through consistent, repeatable, user-defined, scenario-driven tests.  The 4GL will provide a user-friendly interface to define the application layer and message processing logic for simulation of dither side of an interface. The innovative message processing logic includes message identification and definition, field parsing and data substitution algorithms, and automatic generation of both scenario initiated (unsolicited) and response (solicited) messages.  By creating the appropriate scenario events and response message formats, any sequential message exchange scenario between the test tool and the system under test can be simulated. The proposed system design will be demonstrated in Phase II by development of a required software and integrating commercially available hardware and software components.  The prototype will be converted into a viable product in Phase III and offered as an integrated, standalone test tool with a wide variety of both commercial and military applications.",

There has been much research conducted in the area of telemedicine for radiology, and some other medical specialties, however there has been very little research of telemedicine in rehabilitation and assistive technology evaluations.  This project proposes to evaluate different types of telecommunication links for their effectiveness in performing evaluations.

This design incorporates a \"floating\" junction on the front of the ultra-thin solar cell and a collecting junction at the back of the device. This design will significantly decrease minority carrier recombination compared to conventional GaAs heterostructure solar cells due to the active passivation effects associated with carrier injection from the front floating junction. A shallow front floating emitter coupled with an all back contact design that eliminates grid shading will significantly increase the spectral response. The result of the floating junction design will be a revolutionary increase in open circuit voltage and short circuit current. Fabrication costs will decrease when compared to conventional GaAs solar cells because a monolithic metallization sequence and a non-conducting reflector technology will eliminate processing steps associated with conventional solar cell processing. Light-trapping and an adhesiveness coverslide technology will be incorporated into the floating junction design to increase efficiency, durability and specific power. The specific power for this solar cell is projected to be 3621 W/kg for an AMO efficiency of 25%. This Phase I can lead to the deployment of high efficiency ultra-thin GaAs solar cells in the space environment. The proposed solar cell design can have a significant impact on the longevity, cost effectiveness and power generation capabilities of space power supplies. Dual use applications include solar cell concentrator arrays, detectors for solid state spectrometers, microwave devices and better heat dissipation for GaAs high-power IC chips and surface emitting laser arrays. Other applications include integrated logic components, LEDs, LED displays, flat screen display drivers, waveguides and related devices.",

The structure of these detectors will be a Separate Absorption and Multiplication Avalanche Photodiode (SAM-APD).  This structure has proven to be an effective means of producing large gain in the absence of large dark current.  With proper composition InGaAsSb can be prepared with band gap adjustable in wavelength from 1.7 to 4.5 mm.  The major advantage of using quaternary systems over binary and ternary compounds is the ability to vary the band gap while still providing lattice matched growth to the substrate material.  Another expected advantage is that this detector structure will have good detectivity at room temperature while most commercially available detectors need cooling to liquid nitrogen temperatures.  AstroPower has previous experience in the growth of these material systems.  Liquid phase epitaxy has routinely provided quality III-V detectors and photovoltaic cells with the highest optical-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency, and has significant cost advantages over other forms of epitaxy.  Feasibility of this approach will be demonstrated by the end of the Phase I program.",

A key device in the wideband WDM netowrk is a wavelength selective crossconnect for efficient routing of optical signals.  Among the various approaches, the acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF) has shown to be the most promising due to its unique capabiity of simultaneously and independently routing a number of wavelength channels.  It suffers the basic limitation of unacceptable crosstalk due to high sidelobes and the complexity of construction of the polarization independent version.  Aurora Associates proposes a new type of high performance AOTF that overcomes these basic deficiencies.  The objective of the Phase I effort is to design, fabricate, test and demonstrate feasibility models of the advanced AOTF with the performance goals of 1 nm bandwidth, -30 dB sidelobe, 3 dB insertion loss, and polarization independent operation without the use of polarization beam splitters.",

Multiply-redundant schemes typically used in aerospace applications are prohibitively expensive for general applications, especially where low cost or small size are critical. A new strategy, proposed herein, offers the potential for low-cost fault-tolerant control of paramter-dependent systems that will be useful in a range of commercial and military applications. A \"monitoring observer\", or failure-detection filter, would run a real-time simulation of the controlled system in parallel with the actual system, compare the outputs of the two systems, and interpret discrepancies to detect system failures. The system would then be reconfigured to operate on a reduced sensor or actuator set. Both the failure detection and control reconfiguring take into account the parameter-dependent nature of the system. The core technology for this system--a method for tranforming linear-parameter-dependent systems such that they can be treated as linear-time-invariant for control design--has been demonstrated at MIT on an autonomous unicycle robot by the Principal Investigator. During Phase I, we will expand this work and develop a parameter-dependent failure-detection filter and control reconfiguration strategy suitable for use aboard unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).",

        "abstract": "In order to remain competitive in today's global marketplace, U.S. manufacturers are constantly striving to hold tighter and tighter tolerances on the parts that they produce.  What this means is that the manufacturer needs to better control the machines that they use, and in order to do that they need an instrument that can quickly and easily characterize the geometric properties of the machines being used.  The proposed development will result in such an instrument.  The new instrument will be able to save time and money by simultaneously measuring linear displacement, displacements in the other two orthogonal axes, and roll, pitch, and yaw.  The proposed work will build on the background developments at ADI, the proposer, and at the University of Michigan and at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.  In particular, the new instrument will be patterned after the already developed 5-D laser measurement systems, and add a sensitive roll detector which makes use of the same laser beam.  The resulting instrument will be rugged, easy to use and precise.  It will be capable of being produced at a cost that will make the instrument cost effective to own and to use. The prototype instrument will be demonstrated in a shop floor environment to further prove its usefulness and easy set up.  What used to take days to accomplish will be shown to require only hours instead.  As part of the proposed work, an investigation will be undertaken to further define the expected market, both military and commercial, for the new instrument.",

Advanced, mulitple sensor technology has been demonstrated to reduce process time and costs.  AvPro proposes to develop a single sensor system to provide multiple data inputs.  It would be a means to validate models for process control and be a basis for material state specification implementation.  Optical fiber sensors have previously been used to measure numerous composite material parameters.  Techniques have been demonstrated that validate the chemical composition and cure state of composites.  Real time measurement of these parameters provides a technically defensible basis to upgrade process specificiations to material state management.  AvPro intends to develop a single sensor system using small diameter glass fibers placed in the composite part prior to processing and left in place through the life of the part.  No other sensors would be required.  This product would make it possible to directly manage the cure and consolidation of the composite while eliminating the need for extensive tracking of the time/temperature history of the material.  This system, in the AvPro control architecture, will generate data suitable for specification development.",

        "abstract": "Specific mechanical properties of fiber-reinforced composites have made them an attractive material for application to many aircraft structures.  Today, composite structure is typically made up of laminated layers (plies) of 2-D composite material with the fiber direction of each ply thoughtfully oriented to optimize structural efficiency.  The goal of 'continued improvement' in structural efficiency and cost has inspired the development of a new and innovative structural concept.  This concept is to automatically weave complete composite laminate preforms that are made up of optimally oriented discrete plies held together with an optimum density of Z-directional (thru-the-thickness) fibers.  This concept, once developed will improve the interlaminar shear strength, damage tolerance, and fabrication cost of continuous fiber reinforced composite structure.  Development of this concept will eliminate the manual cutting, placement, and debulk (typically ever four plies) of the thin (.005\" to .014\" thick) composite plies.  Additionally, this concept will increase the interlaminar shear and damage tolerance of the structure with minimal impact to in-plane properties by introducing an optimum density of Z-directional fiber.  Bally Ribbon Mills in conjunction with Lockheed Fort Worth Company as subcontractor will evaluate the feasibility of this technology and its application to fighter aircraft mid-fuselage structure.",

On the pre-hospital scene, first-aid workers must, often in a matter of seconds with spare information at hand, make critical decisions concerning the yrgency of an injured patient's condition and the type of trauma care required. This decisional process, known as triage, is an integral component of emergency-care medicine.  Avoiding undertriage is a matter of saving lives; avoiding overtriage is a matter of preventing precious emergency care resources from being overtaxed and misallocated.  Although no existing triage technique has singularly proved entirely effective, there is strong evidence suggesting that use of multiple tests can collectively result in superior triaging decisions.  In this vein, neural networks stand to play a valuable role in producing fast decisions based upon complex, multifaceted information.  The work proposed will investigate the application of neural netwotk methods to the key decisional tasks in triage.",

        "abstract": "We propose to develop a domain specific library and API for parallel computing  in heterogenous and HPC environments.  The domain we propose is partial differential equations.  Partial differential equations is the substrate used for simulation in the following disciplines:  Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Computational Structural Mechanics (CSM), Computational Chemistry and Material Science (CCM), Computational Electromagnetics (CEN), Climate/Weather/Ocean Modeling (CWO), Environmental Quality Modeling and Simulation (EQM).  It is Estimated that over 90% of DoD HPC cycles are spent in these disciplines.  The proposed tool Scale-PDESolve is based on an existing scalar library that BEAM is soon to be beta siting at Xerox, Kodak, and the Cornell Theory Center.  PDESolve enable programming at a level close to the differential equations using an object oriented C++ environment establishing an API for PDE simulation.  On a CFD example a PDESolve program was two orders of magnitude smaller than a comparable FORTRAN program.  To create Scale-PDESolve we will integrate into PDESolve existing parallel HPC libraries such as BLAS (or other libraries that deal with distributed matrix computations).  The resultant product will have a market both as a stand-alone product and as a value added product to be used by developers and maintainers of large engineering codes.",

These procedures will be marketable to the forging industry in the form of robust and open computer codes capable of dealing with multi-stage forming processes and capable of designing shape as well as internal states such as stress and micro-structure.  The proposed development will impact the affordability of Air Force systems, both the affordability of acquiring new systems and the affordabilaity of maintaining existing systems.  This will come in the form of areduction in the costs of forging, through a reduction in the efforts of trial and error die and process development, and in the development of new precision forging capabilities that may replace machining.  The propsoed development will impact performance of Air Force systems through optimal design of forgings.  We can expect a reduction in the weight of piecesd and an increase in their strength and an abilaity to forge new materials that now cannot be practically forged.  The technical objectives of this work are as follows: create a mathematical framework based on PDE sensitivity capable of dealing with multi-step forming processes; populate the framework with the correct physical models capable of generating results of significance to the forging industry; package the mathematical and mechanical knowledge developed in this effort in an open robust software tool that can be further developed into a commercial software paroduct and complete that development in Phase II; and develop an out reach program and dialogue with forgers performing work for the Air Force.",

These translate into efficiency, component lifetime, and component cost as the principal technical issues.  The proposed conceptual design study considers two types of electron sources: a short pulsed diode source and a longer pulsed, high power microwave driven rf linac. Both of these approaches utilize proprietary EBDS techniques and data developed by Berkely Research Associates, Inc. in conjunction with previous preparations for DNA's 'E-Scrub' Program for scrubbing SO(2) and NOx from the stacks of coal-burning electrical power plants.  The Phase I objectives are to complete the conceptual design study, select the most promising approach and perform the preliminary design of the electron beam source which would be constructed in Phase II as a demonstration prototype.",

        "abstract": "The overall objective of this program will be to demonstrate the feasibility of a Dialectic Neural Network (DNN) architecture for use as an intelligent information processing engine for threat identification.  To achieve this goal, several technical objectives have been identified that define, integrate and demonstrate the DNN architecture within the Army's Phoenix C41 software which will be used as a demonstration testbed for Phase I.  The DNN architecture uses a matrix of neural networks and conceptual graphs.  The graphs store knowledge/information in an object-oriented format.  When retrieved, through a question to the decision aid, the stored knowledge is passed to the neural networks which are trained to associate the knowledge elements and form an answer in the desired format.  A successful demonstration in Phase I will allow the DNN to be further developed for use as a threat assessment tool that can be applied to a wide variety of problems where knowledge handling, data fusion or human decision aiding are needed.  Preliminary discussions with commercial product manufacturers indicate that the commercial applications of the DNN-based architecture are numerous and that the ability of the DNN to store and use cognitive (expert) knowledge, makes this particular architecture much more robust than rule-based or statistically-based methods.  In addition to military information processing for the battlefield, the TIPS architecture can be used in the emergency management industry, for route planning, intelligent highway vehicle systems (IHVS) applications at the Federal Highway Administration, and on the internet as a tool to provide intelligent routing and handling of the growing volumes of information available in that forum.",

However, advances in scintillating optical fiber technology are dependent on access to appropriate polymers. Fluoropolymers are currently the most promising products for cladding applications, because of their transparency and extremely low refractive index. This project will design, synthesize, characterize, and manufacture alternative polymer materials and demonstrate their utilization in the production of high numerical aperture scintillating fibers.

This project will develop an alternate, lower cost technique for directed DNA sequencing, utilizing hybridizations of Peptide Nucleic Acid (PNA) oligomer probes.  PNA oligomers hybridize more stably and specifically to DNA targets than conventional oligonucleotides.  Phase I is concerned with improvements in the three multiply repeated steps in the directed sequencing process: (1) probe assembly, (2) sequencing reactions and (3) gel electrophoresis.  The technique allows the efficiency of directed sequencing, while avoiding most of the bottlenecks identified for the process.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The development of modular PNA probes from pre-synthesized libraries should substantially reduce the cost of PNAs and extend further the applications of these novel molecules to DNA sequencing. The resources to be developed include PNA oligomer libraries, anchor primer kits for multiplex sequencing, and customized services.",

It is often necessary to transmit energy for a MEMS from some external source into the circuit, thereby suffering power losses which can be significant. The reduction of the power losses is therefore a desirable goal. The purpose of this work is to develop and build microscopic batteries (0.0001 cm2) which can be located within a MEMS circuit, close to where they are needed. During periods of high energy usage, power is supplied from the battery. The battery can be recharged from an external source at a lower rate, thus reducing power transmission losses. The battery can therefore serve as a load-levelling energy storage device. Presently numerous microfabrication techniques exist for making microscopic electronic devices. Using, appropriate techniques, prototype batteries will be built to demonstrate performance of microscopic batteries.",

        "abstract": "Fundamentally, increasing engine power density, without an associated increase of engine speed, requires increasing the brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) as high as practical.  Achieving the highest possible peak cylinder pressure, compatible with engine structural capability and desired life in order to obtain high power and goo fuel economy, requires innovative approaches in fuel injection system and combustion enhancement rechniques.  One of the approaches is to allow combustion to continue much later into the expansion stroke.  This increases the BMEP without an accompanying increase in exhaust temperature, particulate emissions and smoke. Potential technologies to accomplish these objectives include ultr-high injection pressure, ijection rate control and/or split injection, combustion chamber and air-charge manaegment, are identified.  Multiple injectors per cylinder is anticipated to increase fuel quantity and to control injection rate within the reduced duration limits.  Each of these technologies has its own important parameters effecting engine efficiency and exhaust emissions formation.  The greatest challenge of this project is identifying optimum settings and viable solutions by searching for small improvements from a large number of parameters.  Using the proven Servojet electrohydraulic fuel injection system and advnaced fuel ijection simulation software, BKM will concentrate on development and integration of the injection characteristics of the ultra-high pressure fuel injection system.  Performance characteristics of an advanced fuel injection system shall be provided and subtantiated by analytical calculations, computer simulations and predictions.",

        "abstract": "Brimrose proposes to produce an improved material for optical power l miting at near infrared wavelengths to protect sensors against jamming and to build a prototype device. The proposed material, vanadium doped cadmium telluride, is relatively new and will be used to fabricate an electro-optic power limiter (EOPL). This approach of using a doped II-VI semiconductor for power limiting was first demonstrated by Dr. Steier's research group at the Center or Photonics Technology at the University of Southern California ref 6 of proposal]. In close collaboration with the U.S.C. group, Brimrose has developed various transition metal doped II-VI compounds for photorefractive optical image processing. Recently, we have developed a concept of tailoring these materials for optical limiting applications. In this proposal, we will focus on two critical issues regarding EOPL operation: response time and intensity threshold. By controlling the material processing parameters, material with improved speed and sensitivity will be produced. It has already been established that the damage threshold of CdTe:V is quite superior to that of its organic and polymeric competitor materials. Furthermore, a limiter fabricated from CdTe:V will: (1) be compact in size and low in weight; (2) be simple in operation without requiring the extensive or complex external optical systems that are typically required in conventional optical limiters; and (3) exhibit low threshold with a response time in sub-microseconds. Most importantly, it will simultaneously block a high intensity jamming beam of laser radiation while still transmitting the desired low intensity image.",

        "abstract": "Crosswind influences the accuracy of sharpshooting at short, medium and large ranges.  At large shooting ranges, crosswind becomes the largest component in the error budget of sniper weapons.  The crosswind along the path deflects the bullet horizontally from its aim point at the target.  Medium crosswind velocities (~5 m/sec) along the flight path can cause up to 1 meter deviation of a bullet at 500 meters.  Target range uncertainty can further degrade the accuracy by vertically deflecting the bullet from its aim point at the target.  Recently, Bimrose has acquired current Lidar technology to measure the crosswinds and 'target range'.  Using our experience with miniaturization of optical components and systems we will improve on this current Lidar technology for the application described in this proposal.  It is proposed to develop a compact Lidar system for measuring the crosswind and range to the target in real time.  Measurement of crosswind will utilized the intensity fluctuation induced on the reflected lasaer beam by the atmospheric turbulence, where the temporal behavior of these fluctuations is related to the crosswind component along the path.  The proposed Lidar system will be composed of a solid-state, diode-pumped, high repitition rate laser transmitter, a specially designed photodiode receiver and a processing and display unit based on a lap-top computer.  At the end of phase I, a stand alone compact Lidar system, which is not mounted on a sniper rifle, will be presented and tested.  The system will enable to measure the average crosswind along the path, and also the range to all types of natural diffusive targets, at ranges of up to 1000 meter.  Range and crosswind data will be displayed on a monitor in real time for the use of a sniper.",

        "abstract": "Brimrose proposes to develop a relatively new class of materials to build electro-optic power limiter (EOPL) to protect optical sensors against jamming and for personnel protection against laser beams. These materials are transition metal doped II-VI semiconductors, cadmium manganese telluride (Cd1-xMnxTe) and cadmium telluride selenide (CdTe1-YSeY).  Field shielding optical non-linearity in these materials will allow building of optical limiters superior in performance to other conventional limiters.  Field shielding non-linearity makes use of photoconductivity and the electro-optic effects.  A limiter using these effects was first demonstrated in indium doped cadmium telluride by Dr Steier's research group (6) at the Center for Photonics Technology at the University of Southern California (USC) and later by Brimrose in collaboration with the USC group, using vanadium doped zinc telluride (7).  Now Brimrose proposes to develop band gap engineered ternary II-VI semiconductors in order to tailor limiter operation in the wavelength range of 0.6 to 1.6 um and overcome materials related problems encountered in CdTe and ZnTe.  The proposed materials will have better sensitivity and damage threshold compared to conventional organic and polymeric limiter materials and submicrosecond speed of response.  Limiter built from these materials will be compact, lightweight, and will not require extensive external optical components/system for its operation. Also, it will work for both coherent as well as incoherent optical radiation.  Most importantly, the field shielding non-linearity lends these materials a superior characteristics which other conventional limiters do not have.  The limiter based on the proposed materials will block a high intensity jamming beam while still transmitting the desired low intensity image.  During the Phase I program, Brimrose will develop the proposed limiter materials and demonstrate 'proof of principal' by building a proto-type limiters.",

This new optical finishing process will make use of magnetorheological fluids, and \"intelligent\" medium with controllable properties which are capable of creating superior finishing results for spheres and, in particular, aspheres.  Magnetorheological fluids undergo rapid and reversible changes in their rheological properties (viscosity, elasticity, and plasticity) in the presence of a magnetic field.  The ability to control the magnetorheological fluid allows a controllable and compliant lap to replace the fixed, rigid lap used in the current process.  This new finishing process offers several advantages heretofore unavailable in the precision optics industry.  The process is computer controlled and does not require specialized tooling.  This makes the process perfectly suited for rapid prototyping, complex optical geometries and finishing problems.  Magnetorheological finishing will be used to perform polishing and final figuring on Opticam generated spherical and aspheric optics.  Anticipated Benefits:  Magnetorheological finishing will allow the optics industry to cost-effectively produce:  pristine optical surface finishes, form, and figure, superior to anything available today; aspheric, toroidal and cylindrical optics available in production quantities at reasonable cost; laser and x-ray optics, conformal optics of any geometry for flat panel displays, high definition television (HDTV), etc.",

The excipient uses a modified poly(lactide-co-flycolide), PLGA, prepared as a porous, open celled foam into which the drug is incorporated as microcrystals trapped within the cells.  The foam/drug matrix is extruded under high pressure to produce a high density nonporous dose form which is then cryogenically ground and sieved to small particles suitable for injection by a conventional hypodermic needle.  This method of matrix fabrication may be applied to both polar and nonpolar agents.  Generally polar agents will be more soluble than nonpolar, and will release faster.  Release rates may be controlled by choice of lactide:glycolide copolymer rations, polymer molecular weight, loading, and extrusion pressure.",

        "abstract": "This proposal describes a Course of Action Display and Evaluation Tool (CADET).  CADET is a wargaming modeling and analysis Decision Support System (DSS), focused on critical events.  It will provide commanders with fast, flexible interaction to significantly improve the visualization, development, wargaming, and assessment of alternative maneuver courses of action (COAs), and requiring modes computational power for wargaming simulations.  CADET will consist of a combination of Knowledge-Based and decision anaytic tools and technologies to provide fast nimble COA wargaming modeling, simulation, and animation under direct control of the commander and staff.  CADET will enable flexible user:  insertion of critical events into the scenario and re-start the action/reaction/counteraction sequence from any point; selection of appropriate detail and summarization/abstraction (troop unit visualization, geographic locations, etc.); and Synchronization Matrix preparation.  In Phase I we propose to focus on the underlying Kowledge Representation technology which will underpin and enable Phase II capabiliites.  Phase I will produce a live storyboard of COA development, wargaming, animation, and assessment.  Phase II will result in an operations prototype (OP) suitable for use and evaluation in field exercises.  A fully functional COA analyzer/wargaming DSS for the commander and staff would be developed in PHase III.",

        "abstract": "Chrome replacement and corrosion protection coatings in thermal environments is needed.   Combustion chemical vapor deposition (CCVDsm), a process invented by the principal investigator, is the only open atmosphere CVD technique for ceramics and metals. The CCVD method has been shown to inexpensively and quickly apply dense, adherent thin films in a continuous manner.    This technology can be used for the production of corrosion resistant coatings on the outside and inside of assembled engine and exhaust components. CCVD processed alumina coatings alumina coatings has previously demonstrated a 90% reduction in high temperature corrosion of a metal substrate. The CCVD method is a low cost, high quality and versatile process. It does not require a reaction chamber or furnace, yet the thin films produced are comparable in quality to CVD films, and allow depositions over a large surface area as is required for engine components.  The deposition apparatus is light weight and no water cooling is needed. The thin film multilayering capability of CCVD processing, which is not line-of-sight limited, is needed  to bring desired thin film coatings with corrosion resistant properties to in situ applications.   We have produced CVD quality films of numerous materials including silica and alumina using CCVD in the open atmosphere onto numerous steels. These coatings can save the cost of more expensive corrosion resistant alloys and provide superior performance. In this project, thin films of oxidation and corrosion control coating will be grown onto flat and irregular substrates in the open atmosphere using CCVD.  The composition, morphology, microstructure, wear and high temperature corrosion properties of the coated substrates will be determined as a function of deposition conditions.  A series of run studies will be performed to optimize the deposition process. This research will demonstrate the ability of the CCVD technique to inexpensively deposit protective alumina, mullite, or other delineated materias onto engine components to obtain desired thermal and corrosion resistant properties.",

The models will be coupled with the general-purpose commercial code, CFD-ACE, to facilitate the simulation of complex geometries and boundary conditions.  The consultant for the proposed study is Dr. Ray Mariella, head of the Microtechnology group at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL).  The model will be demonstrated on a selected microfluidic system component in collaboration with Dr. Mariella's group.  The model will be used to identify operating conditions that reduce/eliminate damage to cellular material and DNA strands during transport through the microfluidic system.  The model predictions will be verified by comparing with experimental data from LLNL.

The CHA Corp proposes a new approach where a   very small amount of JP-8 is injected into the exhaust as it exits   the stationary sources.  The gases then pass through a catalyst   impregnated filter that is excited with low level microwave energy.   The outer layer of the filter will capture soot which will then   oxidize rapidly in the presence of microwave energy, preventing   buildup of soot on the filter surface.  A second layer of the   filter will contain catalysts to promote the reduction of NOx with   JP-8 in oxygen rich atmospheres.  Finally, a third layer in the   filter element will contain an oxidizing catalyst to promote the   complete conversion of CO and VOCs to carbon dioxide and water.  In   Phase I of this proposed program, the CHA Corporation will   demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.  Phase II will be devoted to developing the practical technology for   implementing the proposed approach and to demonstrating the system   on a 50 hp diesel engine.",

The remarkable aspect of these methods is that they usually operate directly on data. No prior knowledge or model of the system is required.

Some of these issues   have been addressed in the KC-10 designs (automatic load   alleviation), but because the fleet of KC-135s is so large (ten   times that of the KC-10s), technologies which improve the safety   and efficiency of KC-135s, as well as KC-10s, is a research problem   that is of extreme interest to the USAF.  Current systems require   the boomer (the person controlling the refueling arm) to fly the   boom (the arm which attaches to the plane to refuel) down to the   nozzle on the receiving aircraft. This is a difficult task and can   result in unsafe loads on the boom and possible damage to the   receiving aircraft during docking.  Because of the large existing   functional fleet, a significant redesign of the refueling systems   is difficult and not economical.  Consequently, we propose core   component technologies which can augment the existing systems to   provide enhanced capabilities.

This proposal focuses on the isolation and purification of specific components in plant-derived oils.  For example, L-menthod is a valuable chemical that is the major component of peppermint oil.  L-Menthol is widely used in the flavoring of chewing gums, candies, desserts, and beverages; and L-menthol is used in the pharmaceutical industry as a local anesthetic, a cough suppressant, and an antibacterial.  We propose to develop a new separation process that takes advantage of the high selectivity of cyclodextrins for chemical separations.  Cyclodextrins are macrocyclic starch-derived polymers that contain 6, 7, or 8 glucose units attached in a ring structure, and they are rapidly gaining popularity as a selective sorbent in analytical-scale chromotography.  This proposal is targeted towards development of a practical, large-scale, hollow-fiber membrane device that incorporates cyclodextrins chemically bound to hollow fibers.  Multiple hollow fibers are grouped together in a hollow-fiber module and used to selectively absorb components from plant-derived oils.  This device offers an attractive alternative to conventional packed-bed adsorption processes, which suffer from problems such as high pressure drop, bed channeling, and bed compression.  In Phase I we will immobilize 8-cyclodextrin on hollo-fiber membranes, we will test small hollow-fiber devices on representative plant-oil separations, and we will characterize the hollow-fiber devices with respect to operating variables to determine the important issues to be addressed in the Phase II program.",

        "abstract": "Emerging tactical information systems will provide commanders and staffs with critical battlefield information, but will also provide large volumes of routine information as well.  We propose to design and build a commander's intelligent battlefield information display (CIBID) which will adaptively filter this information and intelligently sort the routine from the critical tactical information items, and present the critical information to the commander in a timely and effective manner.  CIBID will process large volumes of information, parse out critical information, present this information to the commander in real time and in the format desired by the commander, and intelligently change the parsing criteria based on changes in the tactical situation and on the commander's preferences.  In Phase I of the proposed program, we will analyze the commander's cognitive information requirements, design the CIBID knowledge representation, specify a preliminary system architecture and HCI, demonstrate the CIBID concept, and construct a detailed plan for developing and testing an operational CIBID prototype in Phase II.  The final result will be an intelligent information management tool which is reactive to the commander's needs, allowing the commander to concentrate on conducting the battle, rather than on managing the information.",

        "abstract": "Medical outcomes analysis can be used for treatment plan recommendation, physician training, organization and budgeting of health care programs, and for resource allocation. Objectives are to apply the following disciplines to outcomes analysis: Information theory, optimization/control theory, sequential hypothesis testing, and parallel, distributed processing. Utility/loss measures are presently based on physical/social activities and qualitative descriptors of symptom/problem complexes. For dynamic assessment of diagnosis and treatment, utility measures should also include quantitative physiological test data at a sequence of sampling times. Medical procedures can then be chosen to optimize a dynamically time varying, utility- based functional that uses updated posterior probabilities of different diagnoses and patient condition at each time increment, as well as probabilistic prognoses (predictions) for alternative tests and treatments. Dual control theory is relevant because treatments (controls) are often used to both improve level of well-being and to augment diagnostic information (observations). Monetary costs and information-theoretic measures for evaluation of diagnostic data can be incorporated into the utility-based functional to be optimized. Parallel, distributed processing can generate relevant hypotheses (alternative diagnoses) via associative memory and can be used for efficient sequential updating of probability distributions. Anticipated Benefits: Benefits include better resource allocation and cost control at individual, facility, community, and national levels. Commercial applications include software packages and customized PC-based work stations containing parallel, distributed processing boards for medical training, physicians, advisories, insurance/actuarial decision making, and medical consulting services.",

These conductivities are two to four   times those of the aluminum alloys currently used for spacecraft   structure.  However, the composites have very low thermal   conductivities ( 2 W/m degree K) in the through-thickness   direction (k33) because of the low transverse conductivity of the   highly-crystalline graphite fibers and the low isotropic   conductivity of the epoxy or cyanate ester matrix resins.  While the low k33 values do not prevent the composite from   thermally outperforming aluminum when the structures are \"thin\"   (thickness/in-plane thermal path length, t/L less than or equal to   0.01, Ref. 1), higher k33 values would further increase   performance and greatly broaden the range of applications where   the 40% weight savings of composites (versus aluminum) could be   invoked.  This Phase I work will screen for and select a polymer   modification approach to increasing the k33 values of a thermally   conductive graphite composite and an adhesive, assess the effects   of the modification on critical thermal, mechanical, and physical   properties of composite and adhesive, and validate performance   enhancement in a baseline hardware article.",

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodology for predicting steady and transient, chemically reacting, two - and three-dimensional, multiphase flowfields has advanced rapidly in recent years.  However, the modeling of particulates in these advanced codes is deficient.  Current model for the description of particle drag/heat transfer between the gas and dispersed phase, as well as particle/surface boundary conditions, particle-particle interactions, particel-turbulance interactions, and volumetric effects are inadequate for the accurate simulation of \"real\" flowfields.  A systematic approach will be developed where these models will be upgraded and incorporated into an existing multi-phase CFD code with the goal of furthering the state of the art for the analysis of multiphase problems.",

Currently, liquid oxygen and on-site generation by pressure swing adsorption (PSA) are two methods for supplying oxygen to aquaculture.  Both are costly and have absorption efficiency problems.  Membrane contractors, paddle wheels, and porous pipes are used with limited success to enhance oxygen transport to aquaculture.  We have developed novel perflouromembranes that are extremely efficient, and provide oxygen enrichment.  Compact systems of these membranes would offer low cost, reliability, portability, and improved absorption efficiency.  Portable oxygen delivery systems are valuable for reducing stress on fish during shipment.  Currently, membrane systems are not compact or low cost.  We propose developing hollow fiber thin film composite (HF-TFC) membrane systems to supply 26-32% of oxygen enriched air (OEA) with productivity 20-30 times existing membranes.  Our perfluoropolymer HF-TFC will therefore provide the needed cost savings, reliability, and portability for oxygen delivery in aquaculture markets.  Phase I will include fabrication of membrane modules plus comprehensive evaluation in pilot aquaculture systems.

The lack of such capability has been a serious obstacle to the development of these materials. The traditional experimental approach to obtaining phase diagrams is costly and time consuming.  While the current computational approach is more economical, existing programs are inefficient and difficult to use.  These programs require the user to input initial values and to know ahead of time that a miscibility gap exists. Moreover, these programs fail to obtain the stable phase equilibria under extreme conditions.  By contrast, PANDA utilizes novel computational methods and automatically calculates phase diagrams without any initial estimated values or the user's prior knowledge of miscibility gaps.  These advantages, along with a user-friendly interface and integrated help, will allow materials scientists/engineers to rapidly obtain phase diagrams and related information required for high-performance materials development.

Fluid dynamically advanced bowed blading, with non-linear thickness and extended rake, increased taper, and a range of impeller backsweep angles plus advanced materials are used with the intent of improving efficiency by 5-10 points while obtaining a stable operating envelope extending to below 50% of Q/N (equating to roughly a 20:1 thrust ratio, depending on engine type) with sufficient structural integrity to give a good design lift.  Phase I defines the path to these objectives.  It establishes the framework of several advanced generation single stage pumps which will be tested during Phase II.  Alternate diffuser systems are considered.  A novel assessment of total pressure losses and static pressure recoveries will be made throughout the pump.  The proposed technology is aimed at and beyond the Phase III P&W ARPP for the IHPRPT and will also be transferred to industrial pumps.",

        "abstract": "A portable device for neurological function testing in remote   settings is proposed.  The device will utilize various evoked   potential analysis technologies.  Evoked potentials providing a   reasonably comprehensive neurological evaluation include the   auditory brainstem response (ABR), the somatonsensory evoked   potential (SEP), and the flash visual evoked potential (VEP).  The   ABR provides an objective measure of auditory nerve and brainstem   function from acquired scalp potentials in response to presentation   of auditory clicks.  The SEP measures neurological function of   peripheral nerves, the spinal cord, and the brain from head and   other surface electrode recordings of responses to extremity   electrode stimulation.  The flash VEP measures optical and neural   function from scalp electrode recordings of responses to light   stimuli.  A device capable of performing these neurological   function tests, with the added capability of providing rapid,   automated diagnostic assistance, could be used by medical personnel   to deliver early, definitive treatment for the causative disease   process.  Additionally, this device could be used to monitor   general neurological status in compromised individuals, for   instance during operative procedures or in intensive care units.   Rapid diagnosis and treatment reduce the morbidity and mortality of   neurological disease, including trauma.",

Alternative fixture arrangements with computer interface for input of test parameters and a pneumatic and hydraulic system to provide drive and control of the acceleration test will be provided and an optimal design will be determined in accordance with system requirements.  The fixture will provide controlled, accurate and repeatable excitations to produce consistent and reliable calibrations.  The dynamic system provides significantly improved calibration over the current static techniques. This dynamic calibration capability is essential to obtain manikin test results that are repeatable and allow the comparison of one set of test results with another.

The wide bandgap translate into very high operating voltages and very high temperature operation,, which lead to high power levels and high reliability.  Silicon carbide (SiC) is the bet substrate for high frequency, high power devices based on GaN because it can handle ten times the power density of a sapphire substrate due to its extremely high thermal conductivity.

        "abstract": "Vibration-induced failures occur frequently in critical avionics modules and sensors in high performance aircraft, often resulting in loss of mission, a downed aircraft, and costly repairs. We propose to augment passive isolation mounts for these devices by adding active piezoelectric elements. This synergistic combination could lead to a dramatic reduction in avionics and sensor failures caused by shock and vibration. Purely passive isolation schemes are constrained by tradeoffs among break frequency, static stiffness, and sway space. Added active elements will enhance performance by relaxing these constraints. Phase I will begin with identification of system-level requirements and device-level requirements. Realistic disturbance data will be supplied by an aircraft manufacturing firm that has been enlisted as a subcontractor. A prototype passive/active mount, consisting of a piezoelectric actuator inseries with a passive soft mount, will be designed, built, tested, and evaluated. In Phase II, power and control electronics will be redesigned to function using availble aircraft resources. A set of mounts suitable for isolating an electronics rack will be developed and demonstrated to be effective under conditions duplicating the flight environment.",

        "abstract": "CSA Engineering, Inc. and its team members McDonnell Douglas Aerospace and Professor Harley Cudney of Virginia Tech, propose the development of an active structural-acoustic control system for acoustic disturbance attenuation in composite payload fairings.  The innovation is the use of piezoceramic actuators and structural sensors to cancel low frequency acoustic disturbances.  Acoustic disturbances below 500 Hz are problematic in composite fairings due to the reduced weight-to-area ratio of composite material.  Passive treatments, such as acoustic blankets and added mass, have limited effectiveness at low frequencies and significantly increase the weight and cost.  The Phase I research will examine the feasibility of active structural acoustic control for payload fairings and estimate the weight, cost, performance, and power required for active acoustic control of the 40\" diameter MSLS fairing.  Active control concepts will be compared on a vibroacoustic model of the MSLS fairing.  Passive designs will also be studied as a baseline for comparing the active techniques.  A proof-of-concept experiment option task is included to demonstrate the feasibility of the active control concept.  The anticipated Phase I results are sensor, actuator, and control configuration for active acoustic attenuation in the MSLS payload fairing.  Benefits:  The Phase I concept will be fully developed in Phase II and applied to the attenuation of acoustic disturbances in the MSLS fairing.  The commercial development of active acoustic enclosures for semiconductor fabrication and inspection will be pursued.|",

The output beam has a very high aspect ratio and astigmatism, making it very difficult to couple into a single-mode fiber.  We propose to develop a single anamorphic microlens to efficiently correct the beam aberrations and directly focus it into a single-mode fiber.  The mass-transport technique will be used to fabricate the microlens in the high refractive index GaP material.  The lens profile will be analytically calculated using optical path length considerations, and will be digitally encoded in the substrate using photolithography and etching processes prior to mass-transport.  The microlens will be directly mounted with the tapered laser on a heat sink for a compact and rugged package, and its output as well the coupling efficiency into a single-mode fiber will be fully characterized.  This technology uses integrated circuit techniques and is directly amenable to mass production.  A compact, rugged package will be designed for the laser-lens-fiber assembly.  A prototype will be made.  Alignment tolerances will be calculated and experimentally measured.  Design guidelines will be defined for a 1 W device.|  Benefits:  The development of a high power, single-mode fiber coupled device will open and expand the mass market of telecommunications and other industrial applications.

The statistical procedures for analyzing such data are well known and software for performingthe analysis is readily available. The basic idea is to condition on the margins of the contingency tablecreated by the categorical data and thereby obtain a distribution free test that automatically corrects forties. Despite the popularity of this conditional approach for analyzing ordered categorical data there hasbeen very little work done on power and sample-size considerations at the design phase. A biomedicalinvestigator about to launch a clinical trial for comparing two treatments with ordered categoricaloutcomes will find it extremely difficult to determine what sample size is needed. Either the investigatormust assume that the data are continuous, or else that the data are binary, since these are the onlycases for which reliable methods and software are available. Both approaches are inappropriate forordered categorical data. We propose to fill the void by providing new exact and Monte Carlo methodsthat provide accurate power and sample-size estimates for conditional tests on ordered categorical data.",

        "abstract": "Binary logistic regression and its extensions to unordered polytocous response, orderedpolytocous response, and Poisson response are among the most popular mathematical models for theanalysis of categorical data with widespread applicability in the biomedical sciences. The usual methodof inference for such models is unconditional maximum likelihood. For large well balanced data sets, orfor data with only a few parameters this approach is satisfactory. However, unconditional maximumlikelihood estimation can produce inconsistent point estimates, inaccurate p-values and inaccurateconfidence intervals for small or imbalanced data sets, and for sets with a large number of parametersrelative to the number of observations. Sometimes the method fails entirely as no estimates can befound which maximize the unconditional likelihood function. A methodologically sound alternativeapproach which as none of the above drawbacks is the exact conditional approach. Here one estimatesthe parameters of interest by computing the exact permutation distributions of their sufficient statistics,conditional on the observed values of the sufficient statistics for the remaining \"nuisance\" parameters.The major stumbling block to exact permutational inference has always been the heavy computationalburden it imposes. Despite the availability of fast numerical algorithms for the exact computations, therenumerous instances where a data set is tool large to be analyses by the exact methods, yet too sparseor imbalanced for the maximum likelihood approach to be reliable. What is needed is a reliable MonteCarlo alternative to the exact conditional approach which can bridge the gap between the exact andasymptotic methods of inference. The problem is technically hard because conventional Monte Carlomethods lead to massive rejection of samples that do not satisfy the constraints of the conditionaldistribution. We will build a network sampling approach to the Monte Carlo problem that we believe isa major break-through for this difficult but important problem.",

The sensor uses a unique combination of optics that  detects light scattered from individual particles in both forward and backward directions with respect  to the incident laser beam. Comparison of the forward and back scattered components provides an  estimate of particle refractive index and whether it is liquid or solid. The sum of these two scattering  components is used to determine the particle size from Mie theory.  The information is processed  within the probe and sent in compressed form over a standard RS-232 serial line. Phase I of this  proposal will demonstrate the forward and backward measurement and analysis technique and the  ability of the digital signal processor to handle the quantity and speed of information. Phase II will  take the laboratory demonstration model from Phase II and package it in a housing that will be  installed on an aircraft for further testing and eventual research missions.  The uniqueness of the proposed instrument is it 1)  covers a size range that currently requires two  commercially available sensors, 2)  provides a measure of refractive index, 3)  provides the data in a  preprocessed form easily interfaced to computer communication ports 4) samples isokinetically, and  5) provides auxillary measurements of airspeed, temperature and instrument performance  parameters.",

ASC employs a nonlinear, nearly time-optimal, double-pulse control law that meets arbitrary velocity or load position demands with zero sway.  The shipboard anti-sway control will be integrated with the T-ACS Rider-Block Tagline System (RBTS) to control sway in 3 dimensions.  The lighter-tracking component is based on an existing Moored-Ship Motion Determination (MSMD) system also developed by Wagner. The MSMD system is a sensor system developed specifically for tracking the motion of vessels restrained by warps to loading platforms.

It is our belief that the process to generate the domain model, and the techniques and tools necessary to develop the models are not understood by the software engineering community as a whole and even less so in the flight simulation community. We feel it is necessary to first understand the methodology and its ramifications which promotes the software reusability.

The methodology utilizes a power of genetic inheritance to generate new signatures of a given target from a limited set of initial signatures and a reduced 3-D geometric model of the target.  Intial signatures are represented as strings of morphological processes applied to some set of predefined shapes.  These strings, when executed, constitute given shapes of signature elements.  The population of strings obtained from a starting set of signatures is subject to genetic evolution.  Crossover and mutation operations are applied during each evolutionary cycle to generate new signatures.  New signatures in the population are validated according to closeness to a reduced 3-d geometric model of a target supplied by the user.  Only converging signatures are kept in the population.  After a number of evolution cycles, signatures in the current population inherit significant resemblance from the initial subset of signatures and are characterized by introduced additional changes.",

Our approach aims at building a vision system capable of hybrid learning, in which symbolic (rule-based) and subsymbolic (neural network) strategies are integrated to achieve high efficiency and accuracy both in learning human comprehensible sensory descriptions and in employing them for recognition. The proposed approach has several advantages: it can be easily modified and applied to new problems (due to learning) it has fast recognition rates (due to parallel architecture), and its recognition algorithm is easy to understand by a human operator (due to the underlying symbolic knowledge representation).",

An important consequence of this new technology is that it may no longer be necessary to make a once-and-for-all decision to include, or exclude, a motion system from a particular training device. Now we may be able to design training systems that permit optional, modular addition of motion systems depending upon the training tasks for which they are used. This effort will 1) investigate new motion systems technologies, 2) determine which of them may be appropriate for application in new, as well as existing, flight trainers, and 3) recommend designs for motion bases for flight trainers that use the new motion systems technology.",

The design will achieve suitable jet properties (laminar flow) required for adequate injection depths.  Testing will examine the possibility of achieving subcutaneous injections to help reduce injection scarring.\n\nCurrently available jet injectors are not optimized for large scale injection programs.  The equipment is often unwieldy, and the systems have not been shown to achieve appropriate injection depths, mainly because of unsuitable jet properties.  The more common needle/syringe system poses a variety of problems, including expensive disposal procedures, accidental needle sticks, broken needles embedded in the animal, and cross-contamination if the needle is used for multiple animals.  Another disadvantage of using a needle/syringe is injection scarring which results in significant economic loss for the meat industry because the affected tissue must be removed prior to sale.",

Current diagnostic techniques rely on passive methods such as emission spectroscopy.  Active measurements using laser absorption spectroscopy promise greater selectivity and sensitivity, but these advantages cannot be achieved in a working engine until the laser source is made small enough to be flyable.  To enable species-specific detection in this harsh invironment, the laser must be tuned and modulated without using any moving parts such as mechanical diffraction gratings.  Our innovation is a frequency-doubled diode laser system in which the laser frequency control and laser frequency doubling are both carried out on a single chip of nonlinear optical material, with electro-optic control.  During Phase I we will prove the feasibility of this approach by designing, building, and testing a chip upon which the tuning and  frequency-doubling functions have been combined.  In Phase II we will complete the integration of this chip with the diode laser pump source and deliver a working prototype to the Air Force",

We propose to investigate the electromagnetic (EM) modeling requirements for a complete radar-guided weapon system simulator. Specifically, in the Phase I effort, we will develop a prototype EM predictor suitable for missile/target end-game scenarios. The predictor will implement a high-frequency approximation, shooting and bouncing rays (SBR).  The SBR method is suitable for electrically large and geometrically complex targets represented by CAD models, and has been proven to be accurate for both metallic and non-metallic materials.  The EM predictor will also include the radiation and receiving patterns of the missile fuzing and tracking antennas.  The proposed predictor is intended to eventually serve as a component in a whole-system simulator which includes separate components for the missile radar system, decision logic, and flight kinematrics, etc. After completion of the prototype EM predictor, we propose to research Doppler effects, engine modulation, clutter, and jamming, with an eye toward augmenting the EM predictor in Phase II to include these effects.",

        "abstract": "Worldwide, shrimpculture is one of the largest sectors of aquaculture.  The U.S. shrimpculture industry has a value of over $20 million, and the wild harvest of shrimp is valued at over $1 billion.  Yet there are few resources available to help manage the health care needs of this economically important commodity.  A preventative medicine approach to health care for shrimp is the most cost effective means of reducing the substantial losses that have been incurred by the industry due to disease outbreaks.  Two components of such a preventive medicine program are vaccines and diagnostics.  Because shrimp have a rudimentary immune system, vaccination is difficult and relatively ineffective.  This gives diagnostics even greater importance.  However, at present there are limited applicable diagnostic modalities available to the industry.  Those that are currently utilized are slow, expensive, technically exacting, and have only moderate sensitivity.  The shrimp industry needs appropriate diagnostics to help prevent the establishment of a pathogen in commercial and wild stocks, and for managing the spread of endemic pathogens.  The proposed research will develop monoclonal antibodies (MAb) and initially validate their use in ELISAs specific to the two most economically important diseases of the Americans, Taura Syndrome virus (TSV) and infectious hypodermal and hemorrhagic necrosis virus (IHHNV).",

The CCU is the first in a family of interoperable simulators for training a combined arms force in a real-time synthetic environment.  The focus of the CCU is sustainment training for collective tasks and skills in command, control, comunication, and maneuver.  Diamond Visionics Company (DVC) proposes a detailed investigation of the various alternatives capable of providing a low cost solution to the CCU Commander's Popped Hatch (CPH) display.  The results of this research will allow DVC to make a recommendation on, and perform an analytical demonstration of, the selected approach.  Candidate systems include helmet mounted displays, projection displays, direct view CRT displays, and flat panel displays.  These and other solutions will be examined to see which best meets the CCU requirements.  It is intended that the alternatives investigated be evaluated against a set of criteria developed jointly by DVC and STRICOM.  These criteria include technical performance. cost, and supportability.  Further, the alternative approaches will be compared to the current base line proposed/developed by the CCU prime contractor, so that an overall best approach can be determined.The military training and simulation market has long been awaiting a low cost large horizontal by small vertical field of view display.

        "abstract": "Past applications of wood fibers in cement-based materials have been limited to the specialty market of thin cement panels.  Synthetic fibers have recently gained tremendous popularity as secondary reinforcement in conventional concrete for shrinkage crack control.  Concrete reinforcing fibers should provide high levels of slenderness ratio, elastic modulus, tensile and bond strengths, and fineness.  Cellulose fibers either match or surpass synthetic fibers in all these attributes, and also cost less; however, they are difficult to disperse in concrete where processing involves limited mixing action and free water; cellulose fibers also damage the workability of fresh concrete.  These processing problems can be attributed to the hydrogen bonding, high surface area and affinity for moisture of cellulose fibers.  Out strategy is to adjust the hydrogen bonding potential, hydrophilic nature and surface roughness of pult fibers in order to resolve these processing problems while retaining the high reinforcement efficiency and cost-competitiveness of wood fibers.  Phase I research assesses the viability of the approach through:  1) selection of effective means of enhancing pulp fiber dispersability and fresh mix workability; 2) refinement of fibers and optimization of the system to complement desirable processability with high reinforcement efficiency at competitive costs; and 3) competitive analysis of cellulose versus synthetic fibers as secondary reinforcement for concrete.",

        "abstract": "Dynamics Technology, Inc. (DTI) proposes to develop and adapt analytical intel/surv/recon sensor performance models to support ISR TPIPT upgrades to campaign and mission level simulations (e.g., THUNDER, EADSIM).  The models will accommodate representative targets and environmental backgrounds. They will be used either directly, or to provide a physical basis for system performance templates currently used in ISR simulations.  The ultimate objective is to support analyses of specific ISR strategies and system architectures, and their military utility.DTI's approach will be to employ analytical ISR models which:  (1) retain the important physics that determine system performsnce, (2) are formulated as parametric models, and (3) are benchmarked against community standard high fidelity models.  We will adapt existing models where appropriate, and develop new models based on validated physics formulations where warranted.  A key requirement will be to produce ISR models in a form that can be integrated with mission and campaign simulations.In Phase I, DTI will define programmatic and software requirements, identify applicable models, and produce a model for one ISR sensor to demonstrate the feasiblity of the proposed approach.  In Phase II, this effort will be extended to other systems as prioritized by the Air Force.",

        "abstract": "Although standardized tests for evaluating the effects of voice   coding and communication systems on speech intelligibility and   speech \"quality\" are presently available, a standard method of   evaluating the effects of such systems on speaker recognizability   is yet to be developed.  A major obstacle to this end is the   difficulty of controlling listeners' familiarity with voices used   in such tests, in particular the difficulty of obtaining and   maintaining listening crews whose members have equal familiarity   with a speaker sample that is large enough to provide adequate   representation of the population of interest.  Dynastat proposes to   develop a method in which listeners' familiarly with voices is not   a factor.  It is based on the simple premise that recognition   presupposes discrimination-- discrimination with respect to the   perceived voice traits (PVT's) in terms of which voices differ   among themselves.  The proposed method would predict speaker   recognizability in communication systems by evaluating the effects   of those systems on listeners' ability to discriminate or resolve   differences among voices with respect to various PVT's-- i.e., the   effects of the system on the speaker-identify information carried   by the various PVT's.  NEcessary steps involve determining the   nature and number of PVT's that carry significant amounts of   speaker-identify information and the development of rating scales   by means of which listeners can reliably evaluate voices with   respect to these PVT's.  The final step involves the experimental   test of various practical and economical methods of evaluating   system-induced loss of speaker-identity information via the PVT's.",

However, by suitably exploiting their totally digital nature, many, if not most, of the overlapping digital processing functions presently being performed in different ESM/ECM systems using different digital technology and specialized, custom hardware can be effectively multiplexed within a common digital processor.  Virtual digital architectures which can successfully be used to perform the required functions of signal analysis, data processing, display generations, jamming control, and waveform synthesis are evaluated to determine the overlapping commonalities in IEW function.  The feasibility of using mostly commercial-off-the-shelf hardware and standardized software packages, with relatively few specialized cards, is explored in considerable depth since the minimization of custom hardware and software requirements is the key to substantially reducing both acquisition and logistics support costs, thereby establishing both the technical and economic feasibility of the concept.",

Aerosol properties change with time and circumstance, and rarely are conditions similar; deposition can vary over a wide range. No general aerosol model derived for normal clouds reproduces without serious approximation the particle growth and chemical properties of wartime aerosols. A new capability is needed. The balances regulating deposition can be shaped by agent release at hypersonic velocities, high-energy thermodynamics, photochemistry, multispecie dynamics, and interaction with weather systems. A wide range of environments. After deposition, microphysics properties such as particle size, chemical composition, solubility, and potential for ion exchange determine how quickly the toxic moves through ground and water systems to man. We will calculate those properties. We propose to develop a first-principle family of codes that give high-fidelity assessments of BW/CW effects. A key and unique capability in the family of codes we will design in Phase I and develop in Phase II is an advanced aerosol model based on theoretical and numerical developments for wartime aerosols. The first-principle codes we develop assess CBW weapon use, casualties and ecosystem (collateral) impacts from attack on CW/BW manufacture/storage, agent neutralization and aerosol warhead enhancement.

This proposal has identified a possible class of energetic polymers, the employment of which in solution type solid propellants has the potential of eliminating the aluminum without compromising high performance.  This class of high energy polymers is based in alternating butynes and hydrazine nitrate groups. Calculations have shown that an optimum combination of one of these polymers with eutectic HAN oxidizers can achieve a theoretical specific impulse of 257.7 seconds.  A polymer will be prepared by starting with 1,4-dichloro-2-butyne and hydrazine.  Subsequently, the polymer is converted to the nitric acid salt.

The Air Force currently needs to adhesively bond sub-miniaturized telemetry (SMT) and global positioning system (GPS) units to various locations on jet aircraft.  The adhesive must rapidly bond to various substrates with a minimum of surface preparation.  The bond must withstand the forces of Mach II flight and yet be removable without damaging the underlying surface.  We propose combining the technology of electrochemically reversible disulfide polymerization/depolymerization with the proven abilities of amine cured epoxies, the work-horse resin of the adhesives industry.  Epoxy resins will be synthesized with electrochemically cleavable disulfide bonds, which will be incorporated into the network polymer during cure.  These linkages will remain quiescent until actively cleaved by the application of a reducing current at the bonded interface, effectively resulting in disbonding.  This technique has advantages over chemical disbonding methods in that reaction occurs along the entire bonded interface.  This non-corrosive procedure requires little or no added solvents, and allows recycling of spent material.  In Phase I, epoxy adhesives will be developed, which are rapidly cleaved by passage of a low voltage current through the adhesive bond.",

This assessment will be accomplished with a unique method of dynamic testing in the Eidetics' water tunnel using a sophisticated 3-axis computer-controlled model support and high-sensitivity force and moment balance.  The approach is based on previously demonstrated successes in conducting dynamic experiments in the water tunnel where 5 components of forces and moments (no axial) were measured on a model undergoing computer-controlled motions in either pitch, yaw or roll.  Because of the low free stream velocity of the water tunnel, the required model motion rates are quite low, and acquisition of force and moment responses to the commanded motions is relatively straightforward. Data can also be acquired in real time simultaneously with flow visualization. Results from these measurements will provide (1) an assessment of which dynamic coefficients are relevant for a typical fighter and transport aircraft and (2) guidance to determine the requirements for future dynamic wind tunnel test methods. In conjunction with this effort, present-day wind tunnel experimental methods to determine dynamic coefficients and aerodynamic modeling methods will be evaluated.",

In distinction, this proposed projectmore revolutionary than evolutionary, is directed at developing a \"next century\"version of this system that would yield an E.D. of 85-100 Wh/kg and 300 Wh/l, a 50 to 100% improvement.  This will involve the development of both improved hydride materials with significantly greaterhydrogen storage capabilities, improved nickel electrodes, and reducedweight and volume packaging.",

In a power assist mode, the battery is mated with a small internal combustion engine so that the battery can assist with acceleration as well as recover spent energy through regenerative braking.   Such a role requires that the battery have high energy and power density, offer exceptionally long cycle life, meet demanding cost objectives, and be safe and ecologically sound.   No presently available battery system is capable of meeting this mix of attributes, especially the anticipated power densities of l,000 W/kg.    This project will develop a new approach to a stackable wafer cell-type bipolar design which has already been shown to offer performance improvements over conventional Ni-MH batteries in energy and power density, as well as in cycle life and cost.    The  new design  is expected to enable bipolar operation in a much higher power regime than previously possible.  Phase I will concentrate on component development, including the electrode compositions, as well as on separator and cell interface. \n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:    This project should  result in new opportunities for portable or motive devices requiring high power and energy density batteries.

A process ecently developed allows for the automated transfer of these semiconductor films to any host substrate using readily available materials and equipment from the semiconductor packaging industry.  This process transfers the ELO film onto a carrier and then places and bonds the films onto the host substrate.  This method will allow for the automated, highly precise placement of up to hundreds of thousands of semiconductor devices onto a host substrate in parrellel.

The demands on these systems are especially severe in the case of voice output communication aids (VOCAs) for speech-impaired individuals, since the speech produced substitutes for a speaker's own voice.  VOCA quality thus depends not only on intelligibility, but on the ability to express emotion and to provide voices of appropriate age, gender, and dialect.  Eloquent Technology, Inc. (ETI) has addressed these concerns in Eloquence, a high-quality and flexible multi-voice text-to-speech program presently available for English.  However, systems of equal quality and functionality for other languages are few, and text-to-speech software for major dialects often does not exist at all.  In this project, ETI proposes to extend Eloquence to include both a North American and a European dialect of Spanish and French.  In Phase I, ETI will demonstrate the feasibility of applying its innovative speech synthesis technology to a language other than English by adding Mexican Spanish to Eloquence.  The resulting program for English and Spanish will be incorporated into a VOCA for testing by speech-impaied users.",

Equally important, this new approach explains for the first time how many actuators are needed to meet a performance objective and where these devices should be located.  This model will be the first truly practical semiautonomous system that can implement control via piezoelectric mechanisms, MEMS or active microcomposites and would appear to be the first realistic and practical method for designing control systems with arbitrary large active arrays, limited only by the materials issues and structural integrity issues. The theory underlying piezoelecctronics leads, for the first time, to a correct statement of the control law for actuator arrays.

        "abstract": "A environmental problem faced by the power generation industry involves controlling flue gas emissions from coal fired boilers.  Specifically, the 1990 Clean Air Amendments mandate a 2,000,000 ton per year decrease in nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions.  Reburning is a mature fuel staging NOx control technology which has been successfully demonstrated at full scale by Energy and Environmental Research Corporation (EER) and others on numerous occasions.  By utilizing biomass pyrolysis products as a means of NOx control, the proposed technology would both enhance agriculture's role as a reliable supplier of renewable materials to industry and provide a cost-effective solution to the environmental problem of NOx emissions.  Furthermore, the net cost of biomass is relatively low and biomass already includes chemical substances which are necessary for promoting the reburning process.  Therefore, such a technology would have great economic benefits with NOx control efficiency on the level of 90-95%.  Based on chemical kinetic modeling and experimental studies, EER has recently developed novel concepts to improve the conventional reburning process to about 95% NOx control.  The integration of these Advanced Reburning technologies with biomass will offer utilities a low cost option for effective control of NOx emissions.",

The technique has been used to prepare high quality silicon films at rates 20 times faster than those typically used for preparing silicon film solar cells. With these faster rates and the associated higher gas utilization, application of this technique to an existing roll-to-roll solar cell production process would lead to significant cost savings. Furthermore, indications are that the high electron temperatures associated with this technique produce materials with different microstructures which are less susceptible to degradation.  Phase I will produce and characterize materials prepared using this new technique, fabricate solar cells to demonstrate the advantages of using this technology, and demonstrate that solar cell production costs can be lowered by utilizing this technology.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The production of solar cells with higher stable efficiencies at lower production costs is anticipated.

The cost of this approach for coating copper/indium/selenium photovoltaic modules in a high volume plant is prohibitive and the deposition rate too slow.  This project proposes to demonstrate the formation of high quality zinc oxide (ZnO)/aluminum(Al) transparent conductors by linear, reactive, activated evaporation of zinc. High rate Zn sources will be developed, and the Zn will be oxidized by atomic oxygen formed by dissociation of molecular oxygen in a high intensity discharge. Low temperature doping will be accomplished by use of a non-toxic, Al-containing metalorganic.  Films will be characterized by Rutherford backscattering, particle-induced X-ray emission, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and conventional electrical and optical techniques. The compatibility of the ZnO process in producing state-of-the-art photovoltaic devices will be verified. Following initial demonstrations with point sources, novel linear sources for the Zn, O, and dopant will be developed capable of a coating width up to 0.5 m for large area coating with substrate translation. The distinguishing features of this method are a) the very low cost of the source materials, b) the ability to independently control the Zn, O, and dopant fluxes, c) the line source nature of the deposition heads, and d) potentially very high deposition rates.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee: High quality transparent conducting coatings of ZnO:Al from inexpensive source materials, at rates far exceeding current practice, and from linear sources for large area coating, is anticipated.

IR sensors operating at cryogenic temperatures frequently require temperature control to plus or minus 1.0 degrees C while some applications demand finer control down to pluse or minus 0.1 degrees C.  While VCHP's have been used on satellites to control electronic components to narrow temperature bands, despite changes in load and environment that are normally experienced, they have not been developed for cryogenic applications.  Our program seeks to evaluate their use by studying the available combinations of working fluids and noncondensible gases that lead to efficient (VCHP) control systems.  We propose to use a modified version of a successfully developed monogroove heat pipe as our VCHP baseline design because it has many desirable features in cooling cryogenic IR sensor systems currently being sought by AF and NASA.  Having but a single groove, it provides maximum heat transport with minimum fluid charge thereby reducing ambient pipe pressure; it can be configured with flexible sections to provide compliance; it can be configured with multiple evaporators to accommodate multiple sensor/single cooler applications.",

At the present time, the only generally accepted method for detecting when a tornado is on the ground is human observation.  Based on actual seismic signals combined with eyewitness testimony, there is very strong evidence to indicate that a tornado in contact with the ground produces significant tornadic seismic vibrations (TSV), both long-period and short-period.  The proposed program is designed to lead to a totally new way of detecting when a tornado is on the ground, based on the tornadic seismic signal (TSS) derived from the TSV.  This seismic tornado detector (STD) system has considerable potential for use by government agencies for the protection of the general populace, as well as for use by the individual citizen for personal safety within the home.  The specific research objectives to be accomplished during Phase I will be as follows: 1) Comparison of seismic records with tornado data to identify any additional chance measurements of TSS, 2) Continued collection of eyewitness accounts of TSV, 3) Improved understanding of the transfer of energy from the tornado to the ground, 4) Initial estimate of characteristics of TSS, 5) Design of STD instrument package, 6) Development of a test plan for validation of STD system, and 7) Complete documentation of all results obtained.",

        "abstract": "The attack scenario of interest to Eglin involves a conventional fragmenting munition that enters a fixed above-ground or hardened underground structure and explosively detonates.  As a result of weapon detonation, liquid chemical or dry biological agent is released inside the structure, either as a spill or as an airborne dispersion.  The subsequent mixing with air and with explosive products brings about chemical changes in the agent.  The chemical changes can include combustion with air or pyrolytic decomposition.  The potential harm to civilian populations near these facilities due to building damage is largely unknown due to the inability to model the results of various attack scenarios.  Current predictive methodologies are semi-empirical and do not address liquid chemical/biological (CB) agents nor do they allow for the treatment of dry compounds.  A useful analytical tool for safety engineers, structural engineers, and military planners would be a theoretical physics-based model to predict the CB agent release, venting, atmospheric entrainment, and agent decomposition brought about by the combustion of these agents (i.e., the fate of the agent).

Methods of minimizing the effects of plane offsets are defined.

The improvement of these techniques over straightforward reconstruction of projections in differing planes will be quantified.

This proposed motor design represents a breakthrough in that by selecting a distinctively different approach, it easily circumvents the aforementioned difficulties and can be competitively priced. Either rotary or linear motion can be produced by this motor. Physically, the entire solid state motor system is very small and lightweight. Precise positioning of an object, while under load, is controllable to minuscule units of measure.

This breakthrough in solid state motors will position it's development team as a leader in this technology, not only in the USA, but in the world. Commercial applications include automotive engines and within automotive interiors, flow control surfaces, children's toys, and in the automation of manufacturing processes.

This proposal advocates the concept of employing reaction synthesis methods for fabricating small thrusters such as those already flown in kinetic energy weapon programs. During Phase I, a team led by Sabulon will develop and refine rapid, net-shape processing methods which are capable of producing carbon and/or ceramic fiber reinforced ceramic matrices consisting of varying phase mixtures of silicon nitride and silicon carbide.  Materials made during Phase I will be screened with mechanical test and microstructural evaluation methods.  In addition, constituent and bulk response of the materials will be modeled by Materials Sciences Corporation using their CLASS II finite element code.  The best performing materials will be fabricated into representative CMC rocket nozzle shapes, to be tested at Rocketdyne or the Phillips Laboratory.The Phase II Program would encompass an expanded testing and design effort on the part of Sabulon, Rocketdyne, MSC, and other interested agencies, resulting in fabrication and hot-fire testing of subscale and actual CMC nozzle components.",

The chemical energy available from high explosives is 5000 Joules per gram.  The challenge is to efficiently convert the chemical energy to electrical energy.  Flux Compression Generator (FCG) efficiencies of several percent have already been demonstrated.  A 5 cubic inch package containing a 2.2 cubic inch FCG could produce more than 1000 Joules.  This is many times the maximum energy required.  The technical challenges are maintaining FCG efficiency, controlling pulselength, and managing high voltage inside a miniaturized package.  Piezoelectric materials can also be used to produce electrical pulses.  An explosive pad coupled to a piezoelectric stack can be used to make a piezoelectric pulser (PEP).  It works by explosively squeezing out the stored electrical charge.  The intrinsic simplicity of the approach merits evaluation as a charging source to the FCG.  Phase I will complete a detailed analysis of the FCG and PEP capability to provide the output waveforms.  Preliminary prototype experiments into representative loads will be performed.  The prototype will be used in Phase II for development and construction of production quality packages of the optimal device.",

One of the  components of UWB systems that requires much careful thought and innovation is the antennas, since most  of the classical antennas are useful only for more narrow bandwidths.             Recently, a class of antenna known as Impulse Radiating Antennas (IRA) have received considerable  attention.  These are composed of a TEM feed plus either a reflector or lens to focus the aperture.  Other  commonly used antennas are TEM horns, which sometimes include an exponential taper.  The current  challenge is in knowing when to use which of these antennas for a particular application.             We propose here developing a survey of the currently available impulse antennas.  Characteristics of  all the antennas will be summarized, and we will demonstrate when an application requires a particular  antenna. With guidance from the Government, we will then focus on a UWB antenna problem that is of  particular importance to the Navy.  We will extend the theory for that problem, and we will build and test the  antenna during Phase II.             One problem that may be of particular interest is the use of a single antenna for multiple functions, by  using an adjustable feed in a reflector IRA.  Such a Multi-Function IRA will be able to switch between  high-gain, narrow beams, and low-gain, broad beams.  It will be useful both for narrowband and wideband  signals, so it will be able to serve several missions at a time.  This capability will help in situations where  aperture area is limited.",

By measuring the residual stress, parts may be safely considered for service beyond the current \"Safe Life\" arbitrary criteria, and disk sets of similar residual stress can be matched for fewer scheduled maintenance inspections.  FMA's NDT methodology wold quantify the expected life prior to any observed cracking, and thus yield a more economical regimen; more conservative that \"Retirement for Cause\", but with similar large benefits.

This concern is   aggravated in advanced aircraft, since even low levels of   performance decrement on the part of the pilot can have   catastrophic consequences.  Yet, approaches to measuring the safety   of such chemicals focus on medical concerns, and usually rely on   indirect evidence of their performance effects.  This proposal   details and demonstrates an objective assessment system which   simplifies and standardizes current approaches.  The system   combines current laboratory performance assessment techniques   (using synthetic tasks embedded in part-task simulations), with   advanced computer modeling to provide operationally meaningful   estimates of the effect of a chemical agent on the pilot.   Specifically, a test battery will be designed to probe   pilot-relevant skills, and laboratory protocols for utilizing the   battery under the physical stresses of flight (heat, vibration,   fatigue, high-G, etc.) will be defined.  Test data will be entered   into computer simulation models of aircraft systems and missions to   calculate real-world effects of any observed performance decrement.   Output from these simulations will permit the aerospace physician   to make objective, informed decisions about the safety of any   therapeutic agent in the flight environment.",

In this new environment, the U.S. must deploy new strategic manufacturing initiative to win this world-wide competition.

The challenge of this program is to resolve the problem of cost, quality, production cycle time, and time for prototyping.  Tool design and tool fabrication are the crucial steps in manufacturing of sheet metal parts (sheet/extrusion products). During the process of metal forming, the blank conforms itself to the configuration of the tool.  Therefore, a tool will produce an unacceptable part.  At present, the remedy for this problem is the check/straightening or handworking of the part following the forming operation.  This manual rework sometimes account for 40% of the total touch labor hour in aerospace industries.  In addition, handworking inevitably leads to the variability of the product which results in additional cost during sub-assembly or final assembly of the product.  Majority of the metal fabricators still use the trial-and-error approach to produce tools.  It is not uncommon to rework a tool, for a complex forming operation like stretch forming, five times.  The proposed work extend the benefit of the ATMCS to the sheet metal fabrication process with the following benefits: a) producing accurate tooling which eliminates trial and error in tool fabrication. b) producing the parts with minimum cost by elimination of handworking. c) pr",

The development of sophisticated monitoring equipment which may be carried on a belt or in a pocket has largely been restricted to chemical sensors which tend to lack sufficcient specificity to offer adequate protection while minimizing false alarms. The present proposal is to investigate the feasibility of a personal detection device using a combination of Automated Vapor Sampling technology, gas chromatography and ion mobility spectrometry using a novel, recently introduced personal IMS device. The merit of this approach is the ability to offer specific detection information for a large set (20-100) of potential threat agents as well as background itnerferants. High speed GC/IMS, as potential threat agents as developed by FemtoScan Corp in collaboration with the University of Utah and Graseby Ionics Ltd., currently offers the only combined chromatography/spectroscopy approach capable of hand portable operation and the extension of this technoloy to a personal detection device would offer unparalled detection technology potentially capable of detecting and identifying ug/m3 amounts of threat agents in complex bakcgrounds with a real-time response.",

Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) from both medical and non-medical systems has been blamed for a variety of disruptions, in some cases leading to death.  The high cost of EMI has prevented manufacturers from carrying out extensive characterizations of their systems.  Fiore intends to reduce the cost per item by making a general purpose EMI testing system widely available and affordable even to the small device manufacturers.  Fiore plans to develop a Production-Line EMI Examination and Inspection System (PLEXIS) for use by manufacturers and regulators.  Based on an innovative testing technology developed at the Air Force Phillips Laboratory, PLEXIS will take a totally unique approach to the problem of affordable, fast device EMI testing.  It will be designed for integration into a broad class of manufacturing and production lines.  As part of this project, Fiore will also evaluate current EMI and EMC failure standards for commercial medical devices.|  Benefits:  PLEXIS will ensure maximum safety and reliability of medical devices through EMI characterization of every item.  PLEXIS will:  1) Ensure safe and reliable operation of current and future medical devices in an increasing EMI environment; and 2) Enable U.S. manufacturers to compete under the EMI standards being imposed by the European Union.|",

In addition, problems  exist with reliability, interchangeability, availability, and  environmental ruggedness.

By using a high  performance, mid wave infrared focal plane imager, combined with a  high dynamic range CCD TV imager, we offer operability under highly  adverse scene and weather conditions.  Through image fusion  processing, each camera's performance is enhanced by the other.  This renders fully detailed real time images with both visible and  infrared energy contributing to their composition.  Tailoring the optics to the requirements results in a modular sensor that will  perform to expectation in the respective applications and mounting  locations.

Even with severe limits on the number of turns, the concept potentially offers major cost reductions for a very high intensity accelerator.  This project will develop and characterize methods for bending space-charge-dominated beams, and will also develop injection and extraction devices.  In Phase I, a three-dimensional particle-in-cell computer code will be used to study the beam dynamics and guide the preliminary design of critical components for the injection and bending systems, including the use of Panofsky quadrupoles. The code will also be compared with beam transport experiments in a straight lattice.  Phase II will be devoted to detailed design and fabrication of injection systems, collaborative experiments on the bending of space-charge-dominated beams, and characterization of beam performance in these systems. In particular, the critical issues of emittance growth and effect of energy dispersion will be characterized so that applications can be developed based on model performance.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Applications include a variety of advanced accelerators and beam transport systems where greatly increased beam intensity is required and bending is necessary for operation. These include fast, high-current, booster synchrotrons, intense pulsed neutron generators, high-current ion accelerators or energy production based on thorium burning, heavy-ion accelerators for inertial fusion drivers, accelerator-based waste transmutation systems, and free electron lasers.",

This project will develop a micro pulse electron injector system which is less complex, cumbersome, and expensive than existing systems.

Also eliminated is the need for a complex and expensive timing system and laser, as required in photo injectors.

The bulk of the waste consists of valuable resources, namely sodium bicarbonate with needs to be recystallized for reuse, as well as water. Removal of insoluable contaminations by flotation and settling is readily accomplished following dissolution of the spent media, but recovery of the sodium bicarbonate from dilute solution by conventional means is energy intensive. An electrochemical concentrating step is proposed which recovers the bicarbonate as a five-times more concentrated solution of sodium hydroxide and leaves behind a depleted bicarbonate effluent containing 220 ppm bicarbonate that is suitable for recycle. The sodium hydroxide may be sold as a by product, or precipitated out as sodium bicarbonate crytals by reaction with the carbon dioxide which is evolved in the electrochemical cell. Preliminary cost estimates suggest the cost of electrical energy for processing the spent media is less that $.15/lb of sodium bicarbonate.

Foster-Miller, Inc., associated with the Gentex   Corporation, the developer and current manufacturer of the MBU-20/P   masks, will develop a detailed procedure to produce custom masks   within two days.  Phase I develops the procedure of anthropometric   data collection of an individual's face compressed with a pressure   that duplicates the action of the mask's seal on the face, when   pressurized.  This data will be digitized into a CAD file, which   can be transmitted by modem.  This digitized file will be used to   make a reproduction of the seal area of a face using rapid   prototyping technology, to prove the feasibility and accuracy of   the method.  Phase II develops the procedure to make a customized   mold and the molding of a custom-made mask.  The entire procedure   uses techniques which are affordable, and the hardware and software   developed can be used by semi-skilled personnel after a short   period of training.",

These high performance figures are unachievable with present technology and presents for the first time, a significant advance in meeting both Navy and commercial needs.

        "abstract": "Foster-Miller is proposing a unique repair/joining method that   eliminates fasteners, does not require autoclave or oven cure, and   is equally compatible with field and shop floor operations.  The   proposed process utilizes ultrasonic energy for two discrete   operations: 1) in-situ deposition of a thermoplastic composite   laminate patch/splice and, 2) insertion of through thickness pins   around the periphery of the patch/splice to react peel stress   concentrations and increase bondline strength.  Because the   lamination and fiber insertion processes would use the same   commercially available ultrasonic power supply, both processes   could be combined into a single hand held or gantry mounted tool   incorporating interchangeable ultrasonic and effectors.  The   approach offers many potential cost savings via low initial   equipment costs, and reduction in labor time associated with   preheating, repair site preparation and patch lay-up.  The Phase I program will focus on the repair and joining   requirements of real world military and commercial composite   aircraft structures.  Northrop Grumman (Vought) believes the   proposed technology enables both repair and joining of advanced   smart skin concepts involving leading edge embedded antenna arrays.

        "abstract": "Foster Miller proposes to develop a corrosion-proof, near-hermetic plastic packaging technology by combining two breakthrough technologies developed at Foster-Miller.  Foster-Miller has developed a sol-gel  based coating technology which protects aluminum from corroding in a salt-spray chamber even after 300 hr.  This coating can be applied at room temperature followed by a thermal treatment at 100\u00bfC.  Foster-Miller has also developed a near-hermetic electronic packaging technology using highly impermeable liquid crystalline polymers which prevents moisture ingression into the package.  By combining these two technologies, it can be virtually guaranteed that plastic packages can be made as reliable as ceramic packages.  In Phase I, Foster-Miller will show the feasibility of this technology by packaging test ICs and subjecting them to reliability tests.  In Phase II, we will integrate shielding materials and techniques to protect from vibration and shock to meet space qualification requirements.  Foster-Miller has teamed with the Honeywell Solid State Electronics Center, the leading producer of space qualified, rad-hard ICs and processors, to develop and commercialize this innovative technology.|  Benefits:  This technology will provide a lightweight, low-cost, highly reliable technology to package space electronics for applications such as the advanced spaceborne computer module.  It will also find pervasive use in the commercial electronics since it provides the reliability of ceramic packages at the cost of plastic packages.|",

This fundamental   restriction greatly limits the capability of human being in   perceiving and understanding the complexity of real world objects.   Under separate efforts in the past, our team has developed   technologies for a novel high speed 3D Camera and a true volumetric   3D display device.  The unique features of our 3D Camera include   the capability of providing instantaneous, full frame 3D range   images at a CD camera's frame rate (30 frames per second or   faster), a capability that no other currently available 3D image   acquisition systems or 3D rangefinders can achieve at any cost.  Our   3D display device is able to generate volumetric 3D patterns in   true 3D space by a set of activated voxels that emit light.   Besides no moving parts and high voxel bandwidth, additional   advantages of our 3D display approach are all angle of view,   simultaneous multiple user views, large viewing volumes,   flexibility in voxel size and shape, inherent parallel   architecture, and without the requirement of viewing spectacles.   Despite the breakthrough made by our team and others in both 3D   camera and 3D display technologies, there is no systematic effort   reported worldwide to date to integrate the technologies of 3D   cameras with volumetric 3D display monitors.

The primary objective of the Phase I SBIR   work proposed herein is to study the feasibility to seamlessly   integrate a 3D camera system with a volumetric 3D display monitor,   so that the integrated system can capture continuously 3D images of   objects in the scene at a standard video rate (30 fps) and display   the captured 3D images immediately on the 3D display monitor.  In   our Phase I effort, we will focus on the interface and 3D data   exchange protocol between the 3D camera and 3D monitor.  Both   current designs of the 3D camera and 3D monitor will be modified   and optimized.  Preliminary experiments will be performed to   validate the interface design.  Using the phase I data and   experience, we will then develop a Phase II design for a high speed   3D Camera/Monitor system suitable for real-time 3D image   acquisition and visualization.",

Such images provide an all-weather, day/night target classification and fire control capability to the tank commander.  The greatly enhanced functionality of the system is obtained throught the addition of a low-cost, compact digital processor with an interface to the radar screen.  The signal processor taps the IQ digital data generated by the radar and produces synthetic aperature images of ground based on tank or target motion.  High quality synthetic aperature imaging is possible in the presence of severe motion irregularities of the tank and/or the target because of reliable, high accuracy, computationally efficient autofocus and scale estimation techniques developed by GORCA.  No position or velocity measuring equipment are needed.  Such information is derived exclusively from the raw IQ data of the radar.  As a result, the proposed subsystem will be low-cost, compact and lightweight.  Phase I will use requirements definition, system specification, and trade-off studies to show the feasibility of obtaining significant improvement in target classification and fire control performance through the use of the proposed imaging techniques.",

Yet, present day, large area cadmium telluride (CdTe) module efficiencies (7-8%) lag far behind laboratory scale device efficiencies (l2-15%).  This project seeks to increase the efficiency of manufacturing CdTe PV modules by developing a front transparent conductor which is specifically optimized for this PV technology.  The technology to be used for the development of this transparent conductor will be atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD). In Phase I, fluorine doped tin oxide will be demonstrated and grown by APCVD using well established precursor chemistry. In Phase II, alternate precursor chemistry for the growth of optimized tin and indium-tin oxide materials will be demonstrated.  In both phases, high  efficiency CdTe devices will be fabricated and grown. In Phase II, improved sodium anti-diffusion barriers and alternate processing methods for the back contact will be established.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  This project should lead to improved transparent electrical conductor material and contacts for higher conversion efficiency of CdTe solar cells.

This approach will result in the creation of paint flakes which are dispersed in the aqueous medium to be used for the stripping process.  Thus, unlike chemical stripping procedures, collection and disposal of the process liquid will be considerable simpler and less expensive.  Furthermore, unlike the plastic media blasting technology, airborne particulates are not generated thus making this procedure more enviornmentally friendly.  In the first stage of the process, the paint is chemically degraded by hydroxyl radical attack.  These hydroxyl radicals will be generated by Fenton's chemistry or by the photolysis of hydrogen peroxide.  The first stage establisheds electrical connectivity between the aqueous (salt_ electrolyte, substrate/primer interface. The second stage dislodges the degraded top layers of the coatings via the generation of hydrogen gas.

The first is to investigate theoretically and experimentally acoustic, electrical, and geometric parameters of 1.5-D ultrasound transducer array.  The modeling and simulations of the arrays of various geometry, center frequencies, and acoustic materials will be performed, analyzed and optimized.  The optimization criteria will be the best achievable lateral resolution in elevation and azimuthal direction of the acoustic fields.  The second objective is to fabricate several optimally designed prototypes of 1.5-D transducer arrays, measure acoustic fields in 3-dimensions, characterize combination of axial, lateral, and contrast resolution of the prototypes.  We will also investigate such vitally important performance issues as acoustic and electrical crosstalk, matching techniques, impedance variation, bandwidth and waveform.  For the best resolution, i.e. best imaging results, we will select aperature in both dimensions, focusing strength, and practical design and fabrications criteria to address the issue of subsequent produceability.  Anticipated Benefits:  The major military benefit is the development and subsequent fabrication of an unique portable 3-D ultrasonic scanner for battlefield emergency care.  Such scanner will have a dual-use in both military and civilian trauma diagnostics.

        "abstract": "Present NFPA approved designs for fabric suitable for fire  fighti    ng garments makes use of outer reflective surfaces  attached to Kevlar insulations followed by a vapor shield and  additional batting insulation.  These materials are effective in  preventing the rapid and direct transfer of heat to the fire  fighter.  However, after some period of time, the internal heat  buildup makes it necessary for the fire fighter to withdraw to  avoid thermal overload. Composite Fabric Endothermic Material  (CFEM), a patented technology, has been demonstrated in other  applications as a successful means for delaying temperature  rise.  It is expected that a fire fighter's fabric with a CFEM  integration will greatly enhance the effectiveness of such  fabrics and prolong the user's time in adverse thermal  conditions.  Phase I is necessary as a proof of concept while  Phase II should resolve any manufacturing and applications  issues.  If this product is specified by the military, it will  be an effective best seller in the commercial world as well.  In  past military applications, CFEM was successfully applied and  demonstrated as a LASER defensive shield for satellites and as a  lightweight effective means for cooling TR modules and IMPATT  diodes.  A recent commercialization of the CFEM concept  resulted in a food warmer licensed to Pizza Hut Inc.  A pending  CFEM application of the technology to flight data boxes is  underway.",

        "abstract": "Research on the design and simulation of a virtual antenna for C, X, and Ku-bands is proposed.  Such an antenna has extremely promising potential for applications as a satellite communications antenna. It allows for precise tracking of the satellite in all three frequency bands.  The proposed design consists of dichroic elements placed in a proprietary frequency selective surface (FSS) configuration such that all three frequency bands may be accessed, with little interference, by each of the three feeds.  The construction of such an antenna is robust and insensitive to high winds. The FSS approach also expects to be inexpensive to build and provide accurate tracking of the satellite transponder.  The materials used for construction of a prototype (to be done in a Phase II contract) is proposed to be of composite construction which is strong and light-weight.  This research draws on the extensive design, manufacturing and test experience in satellite composite antennas by the proposing company and the principal investigator of this proposal.  Antenna design parameters as well as an outline of the mechanical design and materials to be used in a prototype of the virtual antenna will be delivered in a comprehensive report, detailing the analysis, simulations and all data, at the end of this Phase I research program.  In addition to its value as the basis for the design of a robust multi-frequency antenna that is light-weight and resistant to high winds, the virtual antenna has applications as a multi-frequency satellite communications antenna for commercial use.",

While tapered glass-monocapillary optics have recently been developed to produce these microbeams, several technical issues have prevented this technology from achieving its full potential.  First, it is difficult to produce capillaries having ideal taper profiles, extremely straight bores, and exceedingly low surface roughness.  Secondly, the selection of materials suitable for fabricating the devices using conventional methods is narrow.  This project will investigate an innovative approach for generating optics possessing optimized capillary shapes, in addition to allowing wide latitude in the material choice for the capillary interior.  This will allow the highest possible microfocusing efficiency to be obtained for x-rays, as well as neutrons.  Phase I will investigate the key technical issues regarding the viability of the fabrication process.  Phase II will produce full size, high-performance microfocusing devices.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  The availability of optimized microfocusing elements should have a great impact on research at synchrotron radiation and neutron scattering facilities.  Due to the dramatic growth in the number of beamlines at user facilities worldwide, a substantial commercial market for high-performance microfocusing optical-elements should exist.

The entire memory can be readout in 1 second, giving an equivalent data rate of 1.5GBytes/sec. When used as a correlator, this holographic device can correlate an input image with all 5000 stored images in optical form at a rate of 5000 images/sec.

Micromachined capacitive micrometers have demonstrated the ability to detect inertial mass displacement of less than 0.5 nano-G.

This will enhance WAVES ability to effectively support large, complex digital electronic designs.  The interface will have two elements.  First, a Compiler for WAVES data into a compact binary format for input into both the VHDL simulation engine and the gate level simulation accelerator inside the IKOS's VHDL mixed-level simulation environment.  This will offer the user the choice of running IEEE WAVES within the VHDL kernel, or as a more efficient, compiled binary format that will be directly injectable into the simulation environment at run time.  Second, a Generator that will output simulation result vectors in a WAVES data set format.  This will improve the ease of WAVES creation, debug, and transport.  These two mechanisms form the foundation for run time execution of IEEE WAVES simulation data within a commercially viable VHDL product that has the performance and capacity required for large and complex electronic system designs.  The Phase I objectives are to validate the technical feasibility of this approach, and to produce the preliminary design concepts for the WAVES Compiler and WAVES output generator.",

The final goal of this project is to design,   develop, and produce a Windows based analysis tool to assist in the   evaluation of RF hazards near an antenna.  It will perform all   routine analysis calculations, as well as near-field power density   predictions to determine the hazard zone around that antenna in   3-dimensional space.  It will also contain all reference material   needed by an analyst.  Most hazard analysis of RF systems start   with a theoretical prediction of the hazard distance. This hazard   distance is the distance to the point where the power density of   the antenna's main beam falls off to the Permissible Exposure Limit   (PEL) or Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPE) level.  Presently, most   analysts use simple inverse square law calculations and ignore   near-field effects.  This method frequently produces a gross   overestimation of the hazard potential of the source.  Antennas to   be modeled in this SBIR include aperture (dish) antennas, wire   antennas (dipole, monopole, yagi, log-periodic, curtain, etc),   antenna arrays, and point sources.

        "abstract": "The Computationally Intelligent ATR Architecture (CIAA) for SAR imagery will be driven by both point (scatter) and region features.  I-MATH has previously developed point extraction algorithms.  SAIC will suggest various region measurements, again drawing upon the current results of the MSTAR program.  All of the raw features, both point and region associated, including the (x,y) hash point coordinates, will be input into the System Dynamics \"e\" Genetic Algorithm program, so as to produce two sets of evolved features.  The first set will be tested with fuzzy logic rules (also evolved by the Genetic Algorithm) to generate an index to the Geometric Hashing.  The primary index will be target pose (3D orientation) and possibly some estimates of target class.  This will decisively reduce the size of the search space for the geometric hashing; hence a much smaller group of models will need to be matched.  Currently, the hash matching determines which point model is closest to the point representation of the unknown live image.  A number of metrics are computed, including percent of live and model points matched, live and model basis pair distances, average point mismatch distance, and roation angle dissimilarity.  These metrics are applied with ad hoc thresholds and rules to determine the match.  For the CIAA, we would instead use a second fuzzy logic rule set, again derived by the Genetic Algorithms, to compute more efficient match decision metrics.  The CIAA represents an innovative structure for both improving ATR performance and simplfying the model search strategy.  Notwithstanding this innovation, its components are all proven algorithms with which we are developing other successful ATR systems.  In Phase I, we will provide detailed estimates of the CIAA's performance by benchmarking it to the geometric hashing-only algorithm.  In Phase II, we will extend the CIAA evaluation by comparing its performance to other SAR ATR's, to especially include the MSTAR algorithm suite.",

In previous work, multilayer, thin magnetic films have been developed that offer the potential for eliminating this problem.  The transformer is based on an active giant magnetoresistive (GMR) device that will work even down to DC.  The input is completely isolated from the output, and there is no resistive path between the two.  Both voltage and current can be stepped either up or down.  Because of its large bandwidth, the transformer is suitable for both analog and some digital circuitry.  It can be fabricated on the same substrate as other GMR-based logic circuits and memory elements.  Phase I will demonstrate the feasibility of using these films to develop useful micron-scale transformers through design, calculation, fabrication, and testing.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  Silicon technology has no microtransformers.

Individuals whose hand or arm movements have superimposed non-voluntary tremor or who suffer from spastic motion stand to benefit enormously.  Through design and technology improvements to joystick controllers, formerly impossible tasks, such as steering a wheelchair or interacting with a graphical computer display, become feasible.  By integrating force feedback technologies into wheelchair stick controllers, spastic hand motion can be suppressed by compensation, allowing underlying intentional movements to be expressed.  Specifically, the mechanical impedance of the joystick will be modulated through hardware and software.  These programmable impedance changes can be used to create 'virtual fixtures' to dynamically reduce the set of selectable positions of the joystick, thereby simplifying its use.  This Phase I project will explore designs for assistive force feedback controllers based on Immersion Corp's existing force reflecting products, resulting in a commercialization proposal for Phase II.

        "abstract": "Haptic feedback has great potential to enhance human interaction with virtual environments. superior training, enhanced presence, and increased intuitiveness are proven advantages of force feedback.  While highly effective, haptic sensations are rarely incorporated into virtual reality systems.  This is due to a lack of reconfigurable hardware and software that can be adapted to address diverse tasks with minimum development effort.  Immersion Corporation proposes the development of a modular hardware system and software environment which will allow developers to easily build virtual environments which possess haptic (tactile and kinesthetic) qualities.  The proposed system will allow users to compose new haptic sensations and further, to implement, test, share, and even collaboratively re-design their associated haptic percepts.  Fundamentally, this effort will accomplish the following:  define the hardware modules and software development tools used to generate the haptic components of virtual objects so that force feedback can be rapidly and effectively applied to a broad range of virtual reality tasks.  The resulting reconfigurable haptic interface system will satisfy multiple tasks and will support virtual testing of weapon and vehicular systems.  The proposed system will greatly enhance the realism and/or effectiveness of virtual environments.  This includes virtual reality, scientific visualization systems, computer aided design packages, medical simulation and training equipment, vehicle simulators, and entertainment applications.  An adaptable and capable software engine will catalyze the commercialization of haptics.",

The proposed valve is designed to provide continuous throttling of 2000 degrees F. fuel-rich solid propellant gas over a mass flow ratio of 5:1 with a maximum flow rate of 1 lbm/sec.  The valve design is based on the axially translating pintle which controls flow by varying nozzle throat ara.  To achieve the desired low cost, the valve comprises commercially-available control components such as the actuator and the servovalve and features a unique hydraulic power supply that derives its power from gas generator chamber pressure.  The concept is scaleable over the desired 0.1 to 50 lbm/sec mass flow rate range and is compatible with conventional nozzle materials as evidenced by previous pintle nozzle development which has demonstrated a flow rate range of less than 0.1 to over 1000 lbm/sec and gas temperatures up to 6000 degrees F.  ISP, Inc. is proposing a six-month program at the conclusion of which a heavyweight hot gas valve will be delivered to MICOM with sufficient spare parts to support a minimum of five advanced propulsion tests.  Prior to delivery, ISP, Inc. will verify valve survivability and operability with a fullscale hot fire test.",

The underlying technique will implement a generalization of K.S. Ful's pattern grammar concept which results in generalized 3D CAD graphic rewrite rules.  Such rules are evaluated by specially modified forward and backward inferencing processes, which also support conventional symbolic inferencing, thereby introducing control by the NAVSEA databases.  This class of inferencing mechanism does not restrict constructions to a predefined set of graphic objects, and is therefore more general thana put object based approaches.  However objects can be introduced into through rule evaluation, which incorporates the advantages of an object oriented CAD system.  The proposed approaches to be less computationally expensive than simultaneous equation solution based geometric constraint solution methods due to the effect of rule compilation in which a determinate order of graphic object instantiation is established prior to use of the rule during forward chaining.  However, the proposed  technique is less general than those techniques with respect to the geometric  conditions that can be constructed.  Part of the feasibility study will consider  generalization of the approach in the context of, maintaining the potential  speed advantages.  The geometric situations which are handled by this technique are characteristic of the submarine compartmentalization problem, but also characterize major aspects of the building plan generation problem.

In particular, antennas using this technique would have a high rate of response, allowing for compensation of dynamic changes in platform orientation to be compensated for in real time. These antennas would eliminate the necessity for stationary antenna pedestals, and allow the user to log-on to a satellite system and establish a communications link from a moving airborne platform. By allowing platform movement, the terminal would provide increased immunity from electromagnetic counter measures and from attack.

Low cost of methanol and its high energy density as well as inherent safety are the reasons why there is such a great interest in this power source.   One of the major technical challenges in the development of DMFC is the deleterious influence of methanol on the oxygen cathode.  Methanol permeating through the membrane establishes a mixed potential at the cathode, thus lowering the cell voltage; in addition, methanol may also poison the cathode catalyst.  Therefore, it is desirable to develop a cathode catalyst that will be selective towards oxygen in the presence  of methanol.

        "abstract": "Society is currently plagued by the disposal of post consumer plasti  c waste  products which represent 30% by volume of the National solid waste stream.  The Navy has particular problems when a vessel is at sea with several thousand  men consuming foods and beverages contained in plastic. The plastic waste  volume becomes both a sanitation and storage problem. At sea, dumping is no  longer permitted due to the potential pollution, destruction of sea life. A  novel technique to reduce this particular type of long lived waste is the  Solvent Based Plastics Recycling Process (SBPRP), in which large volumes of  waste plastics are directly reduced five hundred percent in volume and  converted to a moldable or extrudable material. Recent results based on  extensive experimentation and testing have shown that solvent reduced post  consumer waste plastics yield a highly durable product comparable in strength  characteristics to a hard wood. By modifying the process IRC has developed a  concrete-like material with one-half the density of concrete (75 lbs/cu. ft.)  and greater compressive strength (32,000 psi). The object of this endeavor is  to demonstrate the effectiveness of the solvent based plastics recycling  process and to show that direct reclamation of the densified form of plastic  waste produced by the Navy's Plastics Processor can be economically  attractive. Early experimentation has indicated that little washing and no  separation is required prior to shredding comingled plastics. Unlike current  plastics recycling techniques, the SBPRP appears to be very attractive  economically, environmentally and socially.",

We propose to develop a suite of advanced wavelet compression algorithms especially designed for low frequency acoustic and transient signals. These algorithms will incorporate the latest wavelet transforms, including wavelet packets and cosine packets. The techniques will be designed to maximize classification performance. To develop and evaluate the data compression methods, we will build a realistic testbed of low frequency acoustic and transient data. This testbed includes both real data, extracted from the \"Hudson Canyon experiment\" and simulated data generated from the KRAKEN model. A range of methods will be used to evaluate the effects of compression, including a mode coupling analysis and assessment of the misclassification rate. This research proposal involves a partnership between the StatSci Division of MathSoft, Inc. and the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) of the University of Washington. StatSci has an active wavelet and signal processing research group, and in 1994, released the S+WAVELETS software toolkit for wavelet analysis.

Unfortunately these polymers have low electrical conductivity that results in a figure-of-merit, ZT, that is much lower than do the conventional semiconductors.  Attempts to increase the conductivity of polymers by doping or micro particle addition have not proven successful in increasing ZT.  The addition of low volume concentrations of nanophase metal particles (size ranging from 5 to 100nm) to conventional insulating polymers greatly increases the electrical conductivity without increasing the thermal conductivity of the composite.  The anomalous conductivity enhancement demonstrated by nanophase metal particles may allow non-shunting conductivity increase in polymers with high Seebeck coefficients that would result in a high ZT for the composite material.  Since theory does not allow prediction the transport properties of such nanophase materials, ICE, Inc. proposes to attempt to prepare a composite of a nanophase metal in an intrinsically conducting polymer that is known to have a high Seebeck coefficient.",

Several are human pathogens; the severity of infection ranges from inapparent to fatal.  Initiation of preventive measures and appropriate treatment depend on awareness of the infectious agent's prevalence within a given region.  Assessment of disease incidence would benefit greatly from commercial availability of a simple, standardized,l and economical diagnostic test suitable for use in unsophisticated settings.  A dipstick (DS) test meeting these criteria, produced by Integrated Diagnostics, is being used in several countries for detection of antibodies to pathogenic rickettsiae.  We propose to develop a similar test for recognizing ehrlichia infections, whose importance is only now being appreciated.  Phase I comprises (1) developing methods for bulk cultivation of 2 ehrlichia species (e. sennetsu, E. chaffeensis) and purification of these plus human granulocytic ehrlichia and (2) antigen validation studies to determine the ehrlichia DS suitability for further testing.  Phase II will encompass distribution of ehrlichia and rickettsia DS in a regionally appropriate manner for extensive field testing of their sensitivity and specificity.  Accumulation of data in Phase II will permit refinement and tailing of the DS to meet the specific needs of a geographic area.",

This flowmeters possesses many desirable features, including:  significantly lower cost, direct mass flow measurement, direct fluid density measurement, small sensor size, low power consumption, measurement of low mass flow rates, high sensitivity, high accuracy fast response time, small fluid flow volume, simple fabrication process, batch fabrication capability, excellent stability, and compatibility with on-chip electronics.  In addition, since this device measures mass flow directly, it is not sensitive to fluid conditions, such as temperature, pressure, density, viscosity, and conductivity.  Furthermore, unlike thermally-based mass flowmeters, this devices does not generate heat or local high temperature points in the environment under measurement, making it suitable for applications such as fuel monitoring for combustible engines.  This device can replace many conventional mass flowmeters used in applications such as semiconductor manufacturing.  Furthermore, due to its small size and low power consumption, this device is also best suited for both portable, and battery-operated applications.  The major objectives of Phase I are (1) to design and fabricate prototype devices and, (2) to characterize and test them.  Achieving these objectives is necessary in order to prove the technical feasibility of this new concept.  Anticipated Benefits:  Because of its sought-after features, this device has the capability of capturing many existing markets, as well as creating new markets, including, aerospace, defense, active control systems for combustible engines, portable personal health monitors, wearable soldier monitoring systems, miniature weather monitoring stations, microinstrumentation clusters, biomedical, automotive, industrial, building industry, and manufacturing/processing applications.",

        "abstract": "During previous work, Intelligent Automation Incorporated (IAI) has demonstrated the feasibility of a design aid for the design and implementation of built-in on-line self-test and diagnosis of electronic systems. With this technology, Navy systems could include integral components which perform built in on-line test and diagnosis, and which display (on the board itself) either a good indication, or display the most likely failed component or group of components. The results of this development will be more accurate and lower cost diagnosis of faulty Navy systems. We have named our system the Microelectronics Display (MIDIS) Design System because using our approach, each printed circuit card or similar aggregation of components will have an on-board display of its status, including a specific identification of failed components or groups of components. Despite the initial success of our preliminary work, there is a great deal of work still required to validate our approach in more general cases than we have done thus far, and to extend the MIDIS Design System to a fully functional system. The current MIDIS Design System does not handle transient or intermittent errors. We believe that the theory and framework of the MIDIS Design System are more than adequate to support this capability, but a great deal of research and development is still required. Since there are far more cases of transient and intermittent error that hard errors, and since these types of errors are often very difficult to diagnose, this capability of MIDIS is particularly important. Our preliminary experimental system handles only the simplest signal types and although the results are encouraging, under the work herein proposed we will expand these signal types sufficiently to provide a more valid proof of concept. Many other enhancements and extensions to the current \"toy\" system are required before we have a fully usable product.",

        "abstract": "In this Phase I SBIR proposal, IntelliSense Corporation proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of integrating optical, electronic, and mechanical functions in a single low cost, compact and reliable inertial system. The baseline system consists of an integrated optics gyroscope and a micro-opto-mechanical accelerometer. The accelerometer uses optical techniques to measure the response of the silicon micromachined flexures to acceleration. In Phase I, we will demonstrate feasibility of a silicon integrated optics gyro by performing a rigorous design and performing several manufacturing steps. In Phase II, we would optimize the gyroscope concept demonstrated in Phase I, produce and evaluate the performance of the gyro and integrate it with a micromachined accelerometer in a monolithic inertial measuring unit (IMU) system. The micromachined optoelectronics gyro proposed has two unique technological features: (1) a sensitive measurement technique using ring resonators and (2) unique material processing for the waveguide formation. The resonator technique has the advantages of high performance with low sensitivity to thermal variations, non-homogeneity and material residual stress. The processing technology uses micromachining to produce miniature, low cost and batch fabricated devices compatible with standard integrated circuit (IC) processing.",

Recent testing of a leading sorbent formulation, a spray-dried zinc titanate, in a pilot-scale transport reactor indicated a need for improved attrition-resistance of the sorbent in order to reduce fines generation.  Conventional clay binders, such as bentonite and kaolinite, used in the preparation of current spray-dried zinc titanate sorbents do not provide the needed strength to withstand the extremely harsh mechanical stresses generated in a transport-type fluidized-bed reactor.  This project will  utilize a novel clay-phosphate binder for zinc titanate compositions to produce highly attrition-resistant zinc titanate microspheres by spray drying, while maximizing their chemical reactivity.    Phase I  will demonstrate the applicability of this novel binder technology to zinc titanate sorbents in a laboratory-scale spray dryer. The sorbents prepared using this technology will be characterized to identify those formulations that meet the performance targets defined by the supplier of the transport reactor technology. One superior sorbent will be tested for 10 cycles of absorption regeneration to demonstrate its cyclic absorption/regeneration performance and attrition resistance. \n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:   Once the production and use of these highly attrition resistant and reactive zinc titanate sorbents  are demonstrated, the operational cost of advanced IGCC plants should be reduced due to reduction in sorbent requirements.

        "abstract": "41179\nIon Physics Corporation\n\nElectrostatic precipitation is used extensively to control the emission of particulate matter from oil or coal burning power stations.  However, an unsolved problem concerns the efficient removal of fine particulates (particles of 5 \u00bfm in diameter and below) from the flue gas stream.  Particles of this size are important because the human respiratory system does not effectively filter them and they pass readily into the throat and lungs.  The rate at which particles can be removed from the gas stream depends on their average velocity towards the collecting plates. This velocity, commonly referred to as migration velocity, is strongly dependent on particle size. Smaller particles, because of their much smaller charge, have a substantially lower migration velocity.  One way to overcome this problem is to agglomerate particles, thus forming larger and, consequently, easier to collect particles. Particles will agglomerate by finding each other simply through random thermal motion. Unfortunately, this process is too slow to be of practical value in electrostatic precipitators. This project will develop a variant of bipolar agglomeration, where one fraction of the entrained particulates are charged with one polarity and the remaining fraction to the opposite polarity.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Successful completion should show high removal rates of fine particles from flue gas with reasonable time and volume requirements.

        "abstract": "The proposed Phase I effort will determine optimal characteristics for a counter-communications radio frequency weapon (RFW).  There are three primary elements to the optimization process.  One element is the RFW itself, consisting of a power supply, radiation source, and antenna.  They must be integrated into a robust package of minimum weight and size.  Another key element in the optimization process is the radiated waveform, characterized by power density at a given range, frequency or frequency content, pulse repetition rate, duty cycle, and modulation.  The power density necessary to produce an effect can vary by orders of magnitude as the characteristics of the RFW waveform are changed.  Optimizing the RFW waveform can significantly reduce size and weight of the weapon, increase its useful range and its operating time.  The proposed optimization process actually starts with the third element, identifying vulnerabilities common to many radio types that are difficult to counter.  Once target vulnerabilities are identified, the RFW waveform will be optimized.  This determines requirements for the REW, which is optimized to minimize size and wight.  This systematic process has proven to be more successful than starting with a given RF source and trying to find system susceptibilities by trial and error.",

In order to predict the dispersal and destruction of chemical and biological agents, JAYCOR proposes to develop a computer model containing all of the issues that are involved in the control and spreading of these materials.  These include missile-to-missile intercept, a missile attack which can spread the materials over the ground and into the buildings, dispersal in a buildings' rooms and ventilation system, and the in-situ destruction of the agents.  JAYCOR will use its EITACC computer program as the basis for this effort.  EITACC has all of the required elements for predicting the destruction and dispersal of chemical and biological agents.

Even though incremental increases in bearing performance and life have been achieved over the past decades, the goal of dramatically increasing speed and life under the high bit loads necessary for hard rock drilling has proven to be extremely difficult.  Continued improvements in bearing materials have resulted in only modest increases in the bearing life of the roller cone bits.  This project will develop a high-speed bearing design concept that has the potential to significantly increase both the speed and load limits of the bearings used in roller cone bits.  Estimated cost savings can be 15 to 20 percent if the bit life can be doubled.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  Successful completion of this project should result in a reliable, long-life, high-speed bearing with high thrust capability for roller cone bits used in hard rock drilling.

        "abstract": "High strength steel alloys (300M) used in navel aircraft engine and landing gear components are found to be highly susceptible to fatigue cracking, induced by the cyclic loading these structures are subjected to in service. Stress-induced cracking is found to initiate due to improper grinding and machining of the parts during fabrication. There is critical need for nondestrucive techniques which can detect both cracking and potential crack nucleation sites within these components. Current NDE procedures using MPI methods suffer from limited sensitivity to these cracks, on account of the coatings used above the ferromagnetic steel alloys for corrosion resistance. A novel hybrid probe and instrument is proposed to simultaneously detect both subsurface residual stresses and stress-induced cracking in coated and uncoated ferromagnetic structures. Modifications to make these dual measurements are proposed on probe designs developed recently by the authors to measure residual stresses in anti-friction bearings. In Phase I, we will develop these modifications and demonstrate system capabilities through simple experiments.

The second new capability is in the area of material modeling, e.g., heavy gases, soil models and metals under strong pressure loading.  Current DNA HOG codes do not allow simulations of problems involving such materials due to the requrirement that the Equation of State (EOS) be convex.  The new capability will eliminate this restriction and allow nonconvex EOS; this is a much needed, improved technique fo the HOG solver which will allow treatment of solid-solid phase changes, explosive product gases, etc. in complex shock dynamics problems.  during Phase I and the follow-on Phase II hte two new capabilities will be developed, validated and used for comprehensive 3D simulations and phenomenological studies.

Reliable recognition of a predefined set of generic landmarks using a visual sensor is a difficult problem.  The difficulties are posed by the unstructured, cluttered environment.  Changes in viewing angle, occlusions, sensor noise present further problems. The current work in lanmark recognition concentrates mostly on approaches to efficient navigation providing the robot with some form of detailed representation of the environment.  We propose a biologically-based artificial intelligence approach utilizing visual cues suitable for both indoor and outdoor landmark recognition.  We first apply a biologically motivated filter to extract edge and boundry features from visual images.  We then apply qualitative techniques like perpetual grouping to hypothesize and verify man-made structures.  The natural textures such as grass and water in the outdoors are segmented and recognized using texture boundaries obtained using the output of the same filter.

In this program, LAMBDA OMEGA will evaluate current fastener and fastener installation rates and installation technology, collect data to determine commercially available fastener installation rates and installation tolerances.  We shall also evaluate potential technology enhancements and propose practical solutions to current shortfalls.  We shall also quantify the benefits of a very flush fastener installation in terms of fastener installation cost reductions, aerodynamic drag reduction and potential radar cross section reduction, and perform a preliminary product design.",

A successful Phase I program will establish a design for Phase II work to implement as a prototype.

A mock-up of a laser camera unit with a 3 watt laser mounted on a TE-cooled cold plate will be designed, built and tested. A second objective will involve analysis of the BAGI synchro-scan system, with the goal being improvement of video optical resolution without sacrificing operational range or system size. This effort will include the design, fabrication and testing of a large aperture horizontal scan mirror assembly. The third objective will be to analyze the overall performance of the BAGI system with the direct TE cooling and re-designed synchro-scan configuration. A mathematical model will be used to predict the system operational range and leak detection sensitivity for the AEDC application.  Should these objectives be accomplished, advanced development feasibility will be established, and the design and fabrication of a sensitive portable gaseous leak locator will have a high probability of success.",

        "abstract": "A consequence of improved laser technology is an increase in the potential for it to be used as an effective weapon.  The principle intended targets are the sensitive tissues of the eye and a variety of optical instruments.  Protection from these threats rests in the deployment of inexpensive power limiting materials which act by rapidly increasing their absorption at wavelengths between 400 and 700 upon exposure to laser radiation within this wavelength range (the other wavelengths are negligibly important for human vision and can be blocked permanently with the use of well known filter materials.  LPT proposes to use its experience and that of its consultant's in photonic polymers to address this problem.  The proposed series of polymers are known to dramatically and quickly change their absorption profile as they undergo changes in electronic configuration induced by strong illumination.  The polymers are soluble in a number of solvents and are expected to be highly processable and therefore useful in a large number of device configurations.  The materials will be synthesized, thoroughly characterized, and tested.  Having demonstrated the potential of these materials to meet the requirements of the solicitation, subsequent work will involve optimization of the prototypes delivered to the Army.",

The advantages of the Pultrusion Process in this regard have long been recognized by the composite community, and part shaping of pultuded sections has been identified as a promising means of producing a range of structural components in recent cost modeling initiatives (NASA/ACT). However, the major drawback of the process is the restriction to linear cross section (prismatic) components. Practicable reshaping techniques and methods of imparting complex curvatures are now being developed. This work combines controlled thermal distortion with recently developed Selective Interval Pulshaping Technology to provide a processing strategy to produce circumferencial and longitudinal stiffening elements of aircraft fuselage and other aerospace structures, with process economics exceeding any existing by at least a factor of two. Proprietary techniques will be used to produce elastomeric matrix sections to provide structures with enhanced vibration damping.

Next, two general concepts are advanced: one is a shipboard transceiver that both tracks and communicates with an aircraft equipped with a modulated retroreflector; the other concept replaces the retroreflector with a full transceiver. The third objective analyzes both concepts from a communications and tracking standpoint. Tracking shall determine both aircraft angle-angle and range information.

Such measurements are useful in characterizing elastic materials properties.  The sensor is based upon the so-called self-mixing effect in lasers, which enables the assembly of velocimeters containing nothing more than a diode laser, a lens, and a signla processor.  The sensor combines high sensitivity and a very low parts count with a PC-based signal processor, to produce an instrument capable of measuring vibrations of specimens as small as tens of micrometers.  It can easily be fitted to a microscope for real-time specimen observation during testing.  A prototype velocity sensor has been assembled and tested using equipment purchased for less than $500.  During Phase I, we propose to extend the demonstrated linear velocity sensing capability to sensing of vibrations of small objects, and to carry out a baseline design of a low-cost signal processor/display prototype.  During Phase II, we will finalize the hardware design and develop a complete instrument for thin-film measurement and display.

The Li/CuCl*2/inorganic electrolyte system can presently deliver 226 w/kg and 181 Whr/kg for continuous discharge at up to 10 mA/cm*2 (3C) for over 500 deep cycles.  Such performance is unmatched by any other known rechargeable system.  The approach to demonstrate the safety of Li/CuCl*2 cells that will be undertaken during Phase I will be to subject hermetically welded prismatic D size Li/CuC1*2 cells in stainless steel cases to electrical abuse tests, such as >25 mA/cm*2 charging pulses lasting approximately equal to 20 s. The prismatic D cells will contain a 2.0 x 4.0 cm CuCl*2 electrode and a less than 400 psi pressure vent.  A number of innovative materials and approaches will be evaluated to improve the Li electrode cycling efficiency.  At least 30% of the Phase I effort will involve work to develop and evaluate experimental methods to greatly reduce the probability of leakage of the plastic ring on the perimeter of bipolar electrodes.  Preliminary designs and cost estimates will be prepared for the size of 270 V bipolar Li/CuCl2 battery that best meets the requirements for a MEA.",

The large FOR scanners for precision munitions need to be fast, small, light, rugged, low in power consumption, and inexpensive. Present scanning approaches using binary optics with microshifting mechanism, gimbaled mirror and wedge scanners, and liquid crystal phased arrays have limitations in image quality, size, mass, and/or speed. We propose to perform a detailed analysis through a preliminary design and performance prediction of a novel large FOR optical/IR scanning system. This system can rapidly steer coherent and incoherent illumination to any angle within a large FOR. It may be used in many applications. This concept has the potential to provide substantial performance improvements over previous techniques. The analysis will include parametric design studies to determine the performance tradeoffs and operating constraints. The design will then be optimized for a precision munitions application.",

        "abstract": "Every year millions of pounds of expendable sensors are deployed in the oceans of the world. After they finish reporting their measurements they are left to either sink to the bottom or float on the surface until they wash up on some unknown shore. In either case, they are generally built from materials designed to operate reliably in the ocean environment, and as a consequence, persist in the environment unchanged for centuries. 'Ibis does not have to be the case. Many, if not most, of the materials in many commonly used sensor systems, such as sonobouys and expendable bathythermographs, can potentially be replaced with materials that will degrade over a much shorter time span, returning the bulk of the device to the environment in a beneficial, or at least benign, way. This degradation can take several routes. Polymeric components, or components that can be replaced with polymeric components, can be made from materials which are consumed as food by single celled organisms and become part of the food chain. Metallic components can be made from metals, such as magnesium, which are already present at relatively large concentrations in seawater. Through the inclusion of the proper accelerators they can be programmed to rapidly corrode and dissolve, returning to the natural environment they were originally obtained from. It is proposed that these methods, and others, be studied to find ways to produce sensors that can harmlessly disappear into the sea.",

In the battlefield environment, clean, fresh water is generally very difficult to supply due to the limitations of logistics operability.  Thus, portable desalination devices are of vital importance to soldiers for survival.  Central to the proposed portable desalination system is a thin bipolar ionomer film coated on a uncharged microporous membrane.  The thin ionomer film rejects the passage of small ionic particles while allowing the passage of water under low manually applied pressures.  Pretreatment of raw water using filter paper, activated carbon and peroxoborate will be carried out in order to remove possible impurities, e.g., bacteria, pathogens, toxins, suspended materials and undissolved solids.

Ozone treatment has shown some promise for safe and effective aflatoxin destruction, but its practical use has been limited by available methods of production and delivery.

It is standard practice to excavate and transport contaminated soil to a suitable landfill or to incinerate the soil to remove the contaminant.  Such practices are expensive, environmentally disruptive, require extensive permitting and only move the contamination from one location to another.  On-site and in-situ treatments of contaminated soils are safe and economical methods of permanently solving this problem.  Many soil and ground water contaminants are highly volatile and enable separation methods such as in-situ vacuum extraction and air injection to be used for their removal.  However, these methods are often difficult to use because of slow rates of volatilization and because of the lack of effective methods to treat the hazardous material following the extraction step.  This project will develop a new in-situ technique to enhance existing soil extraction procedures by being effective against volatile as-well-as non volatile compounds, shorten treatment times, and develop a new catalytic process to degrade the extracted contaminants on site.  In Phase II, a mobile treatment unit will be constructed and pilot tested.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The method could be used as a primary or secondary technology for the treatment of underground formations contaminated with hazardous organic wastes.  It can be set up promptly after accidental pollution takes place, and it has the potential to be harmlessly applied.  This technology could be readily transferred to the commercial sector.",

        "abstract": "A new approach to implementing self-routing switch for wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) fiber-optic network applications is proposed.  This switch is based on an innovative wavelength router that divides the incident optical signal into separated spectral bands at two output ports.  The wavelength router is insensitive to the polarization state of light signals, and has a low side-lobe crosstalk and an excellent temperature stability.  The switching function of the router is performed by high-speed ferroelectric liquid-crystal devices, so that the reconfiguration speed can be as short as 35 microseconds.  A distinctive feature of this liquid-crystal device is that a binary operation condition can be arranged so that no electric power is required on both switch states, and only extremely small amount energy (100 pJ) is needed for each switching transition.  This device technology enables communication in a remotely distributed network where power supply is critical.  An out-of-band signaling architecture is proposed to transmit the header information at 1310nm, while dense WDM channels at 1550nm window are utilized for payloads.  When remote power is unavailable, pipelining the 1310nm optical power can be adopted to actuate this low power-consumption switching nodes.",

Malibu Research has a potential way around this impasse based on a dynamic version of our proven FLAPS phased-surface antenna technique. A principal product of ours is the FLAPS phased-surface which has the capability of directing RF in specific design directions through the use of arrays of varying length shorted dipoles to generate any surface phased gradient. By dynamic variation of the dipole pattern, electronic beam scanning will result. The specific proposed means of accomplishing this is by a programmable plasma display -- similar in nature to plasma display television and laptop computers. The concept and preliminary parameters for this are given in our proposal. The key points are as follows: a) The proposed technique is a merger of two advanced but proven technologies; i.e., FLAPS and plasma display. b) The plasma display elements are highly RF conductive ionized gases. c) The resolution, speed and huge number of computer updatable display elements yields a highly dynamic, large RF size electronic antenna with multi-band capability. d) The above provides both X-band search and fire-control, and millimeter-wave imaging (for landing) and fire-control functions.",

        "abstract": "Advances in high performance polymer composites require precise methods of process monitor and control.  Techniques using embedded sensors for in-situ monitoring provide such capability.  A new method based on real-time monitoring of small molecule rotation in the developing matrix is proposed.  The method uses a transient dielectric measurement, Time-Domain-Reflectometry Dielectric Spectroscopy, to capture a broad rotational spectrum at once. Transient response is sampled by embedded electrode sensors and converted to microwave frequency spectra by Laplace transform; variations in converted spectra are in turn related to cure.  The proposed method offers advantages in that 1) the electrode sensors are simple and easily embedded in the process material, 2) the small-molecule mechanism monitors absolute levels of cure, and 3) the transient measurement technique tracks cure evolution at high rates of speed.  Expected results will be the development of electrode sensors suitable for in-situ monitoring, identification and tracking of small molecule activity in representative epoxy systems, and an initial correlation between this activity and rheological and mechanical properties.  the work draws on much experience in our laboratory in dielectric process monitoring, and on new work involving transient dielectric measurement in high conductivity liquids and gels.",

        "abstract": "The increasing need for materials to possess both environmental compatibility to include safe disposal prerequisites and self-lubricating capabilities that are non-toxic as well as adaptable to green manufacturing processes has led to the resurgence for the development of alternative alloys to exiting toxic materials, specifically lead.  As one of the major materials that has been identified for extensive replacement in numerous applications, this material is presently used as a solid lubricant in bearings, bushings, sleeves and other moving mechanical assemblies.  Lead is also an alloying element in low temperature melting solders currently used in electronic circuitry and is an additive that is used extensively in lubricants and greases.  In all these cases, the applications for lead were developed over the years primarily because of its extremely good lubrication properties and its easy availability at a relatively favorable price of about 20 cents per pound.  In this Phase I proposal, we will develop a new generation of non-toxic self-lubricating materials that can eliminate the need for the use of lead in lubrication and possibly in solder applications.  These materials will be synthesized using the currently acceptable industrial practices so that they can be directly adapted into various industrial applications with mininum testing requirements.  We will also present a range of material compositions for evaluation during Phase I.  In Phase II, we will run tests on components such as bearings, sleeves and bushings as well as lubricants containing additives used in automotive and other heavy duty load bearing applications to meet both ASTA/SA standards.  By the end of Phase II, we plan to have developed an economically viable and safe alternative to lead based self-lubricating materials for direct replacement in a wide variety of rolling and sliding contact applications.",

        "abstract": "The use of a thermal barrier coating (TBC) can substantially increase the efficiency of gas turbine engines by allowing increased working temperature and/or reduction of cooling airflow. Current TBCs consist of a single ceramic layer, about 10% porous, appliled to the bond coated metallic substrates.  The single ceramic layer structure is more susceptible to damage, and it does not greatly restrict the influx of oxygen or other corrosive gases from reaching the bond coat. The multi-layer construction will be more resistant to damage, and the reinforcement layers within the structure can be engineered to function as the diffusion barriers against oxygen and other corrosive gases.  By adapting the multi-layer configuration, not only the individual thickness of thermal insulation layer will be restricted to micro- or even nano-scale, their overall thickness will be reduced as well, thus microstructural control is necessary to increase the thermal barrier efficiency.  The two technologies for making current TBCs, plasma spray and PVD, are incapable of generating ceramic coating layers with the desired thickness and microstructure demanded by the multi-layer TBC approach.  In this Phase I effort, MMI proposes to develop a sol-gel process to apply micro-laminated TBC with an engineered structure, controlled thickness and microstructures.",

It is expected that highly crosslinked, amorphous poly(paraphenylene) thermosets will have unusual structures and unique properties. The preliminary results on polyphenylene adhesives showed that these materials have good adhesion not only to many metals but also to carbon fibers and other polymers, such as polyimides. We anticipate the new thermosetting adhesives will have much higher modulus and strength, higher thermal and chemical stability, and lower moisture-uptake, while still maintaining other properties of conventional adhesives such as high processability and good adhesion.

Previous evaluations (SBIR Contract DAAH01-94--C-R040) demonstrated the ballistic performance of these polymers to be superior to that of current plastic materials, including polycarbonate and acrylic. Consideration of the Poly-X(TM) materials' ballistic performance and failure modes suggest that they can yield new body armors with unparalleled properties, possibly either constructed of the Poly-X(TM) materials alone or, more likely, in conjunction with fiber-reinforced backings like Spectra-Shield(TM).  For instance, compared to rigid metal, ceramic or cermet strike-face materials, Poly-X(TM) inserts would offer much lower weight, equivalent or improved performance, greater design flexibility and producibility (due to their thermoplastic processability), and potentially lower cost.  During the proposed Phase I program, we will prepare several Poly-X(TM) sample configurations and Simula will test them against \"worst- case\" 7.62-mm ball ammunition threats as an initial demonstration of the effectiveness of these materials and to help to identify the most promising design concepts for utilizing them.

Even though most of these cathodes are still actively under Research and Development for secondary applications, some of these cathodes can now be seriously considered for at least the primary applications.  One such cathode is the Aerogel (ARG) V205.  For this Phase I effort, we propose the investigation of a Li/(ARG)V205 lithium-based primary cell.  Our analysis shows that such a proposed system can be 30% better in capacity and 18% better in gravimetric energy density over the current Army's baseline primary Li/MnO2.  The ARG V205 will be processed by the Sol-Gel technique and we will use C02 for the hypercritical drying process.  Rate enhancements for this cathode materials will be approached from two different directions: processing and densification of thin electrodes and use of more conductive electrolyte.  Success in this Phase I effort will not only give the Army another option for a high-energy lithium cell for the BA-X847A/U batteries, but also in OEM and commercial applications - implantable device, \"smart\" cards, standby batteries for notebook computers, are few examples.  Four tasks are proposed: (1) Synthesis and Characterization of Aerogel V205, (2) Thin Electrode Processing for Optimum Cathode Density and Enhanced Conductivity, (3) Electrolyte Solution Evaluations, and (4) Demonstrations of \"Pouch\" Cells.  These tasks will be conducted within a six-month period.  The Lithium-Aerogel Vanadium Pentoxide primary cell can be used as another alternate baseline for the Army's BA-X847A/U batteries.

The design will be based on the aerodynamic flow path of M-DOT's DARPA-funded TPR80-1 turboprop engine which is currently under test.  The engine as projected, will be approximately 1/5 scale, have a static thrust of 6.2 newtons (1.4 lbs), a maximum diameter less than 4.0 cm and approximate mass of 85 g.  As a gas generator supplying a tip-jet driven fan, maximum power output would be 0.75 kw (1.0 hp).  On a micro UAV with characteristic length of 15 cm, this engine will afford vertical takeoff, 100 kph dash capability, hover capability and 1-hour mission duration using heavy fuel.  Phase I Technical Objectives are: 1) Perform a mission and vehicle analysis to identify desired engine performance characteristics, interfaces and installation envelope, 2) Determine the engine scale that best meets the performance requirements identified by the mission study, 3) Conduct a system trade study that compares an integrated electrical generator and power conditioning electronics to a battery, 4) Design, fabricate and text a prototype turbojet, and 5) Create a Phase II program plan for design refinement, fabrication and flight test of the engine and tip-jet-driven lift fan.",

Radar signals have long been used to  collect remote data from the ocean surface, and so, new methods  which utilize wide-band technology should be developed.  METRATEK has unique experience with such systems because we have  been building them since 1984 and have been flying one for the  past four years.  A METRATEK in-house Model 100 or Model 200 ultra wide-band instrumentation radar will be used as a test bed  for waveform design and processing.  These radars are highly  versatile, full featured, software controllable systems which  have been used in a variety of applications.  Using METRATEK  In-house Radars and data we expect to design and test waveforms  for the characterization of the ocean using wide-band radar  technology with a minimum of hardware prototyping costs and  risk.  The final system design will consist of a more cost  effective implementation of the features that were determined  useful during testing.",

        "abstract": "The development of future commercial combustors as well as the   redesign of current models relies heavily on diagnostic information   collected on operating combustors.  Key diagnostic information   includes spatially resolved temperature maps, as well as maps of   mass and energy transport coefficients.  Diagnostics in commercial   combustors are hampered by the presence of particulates such as   soot which greatly increases the flame luminosity.  Additionally,   such combustors operate at high pressure.  To address the   diagnostic needs in these challenging environments, we propose the   application of a non-resonant, spatially-resolved, non-intrusive,   laser diagnostic to commercial combustors for the measurement of   temperature and thermal diffusivity.  The frequency-based technique   provides a measure of temperature and transport properties   independent of any amplitude fluctuations of the signal due to   laser intensity fluctuations, beam steering, or beam extinction.   The technique requires only minimal optical access and produces a   spatially coherent signal that makes discrimination against   background luminosity and scattering easy.  In a particle-laden,   high pressure combustor, the signal will have measurable   contributions from both the gas-phase constituents and the soot   particles without the need of a tunable laser system.  The detected   signal increases quadratically with pressure and can be employed   for either point or line measurements.",

The innovations will be integrated with an existing and easy to use authorable tutoring system.  The integrated tutor will allow instructors to easily develop lessons in a wide variety of domains.  The completed tutoring system will include: 1) an authorable knowledge base that will allow the addition and modification of domains, 2) a state of the art English natural language processing system, 3) an authoring interface to the lexical semantics structure that will allow non-linguists to enter new nouns, 4) a dialogue management and language generation system, and 5) a general-purpose instructional authoring module that will allow instructional developers to develop training material in a wide variety of domains.  This tool will significantly advance the state-of-the-art in dialogue-based authoring tools and tutors.  Significant commercial potential exists for a intelligent tutoring system that can be directly transportable to a broad range of learning domains.

A preliminary, stable bacteriophage technique has been developed for a rapid and sensitive detection of Listeria in poultry and dairy products.  Additional bacteriophage will be isolated and labeled to allow for the detection of food borne pathogen such as Listeria, Salmonella, Shigellae, E. coli, Campylobacter and Pseudomonas spp.  The scope of this work is the extention of characterization and identification of bacteriophage with the intent of developing sensitive and rapid test kits.

        "abstract": "Microwave Technologies Incorporated is proposing the development of a very compact radio-frequency (rf) electron beam accelerator which appears to be well-suited for BMDO's directed energy applications. This novel concept employs a single short rf cavity operating in circular polarization to accelerate a low-energy ma ~netized pencil beam to energies that range from 2 to 10 MeV. The proposed accelerator produces a continuous high-energy high-current electron beam and should have numerous applications in industry and in medicine. Some examples include x-ray radiotherapy machines, electron beam welding, security x-ray imaging machines for airports, sterilization of medical waste and food processing. We propose a detailed non-linear analysis and multi-particle computer simulations of this concept in order to characterize maximum energy attainable, energy spectrum, beam-quality effects and other key parameters. Based on these studies, we will carry out a conceptual design in Phase I that should lead to the construction and testing of a prototype rf accelerator in Phase II. It is estimated that the proposed accelerator, due to its compactness and light weight, should provide a 50% reduction in the cost of the accelerator compared to conventional devices. If successful, this rf-acceleration scheme could be the basis for a new class of compact and affordable 2-10 MeV rf accelerators for radiotherapy and industrial applications.  We anticipate that this compact rf-accelerator will be able to provide 2-10 MeV electron beams for applications such as radiotherapy, sterilization of medical waste, food processing and electron beam welding, among others. The proposed accelerator should be more compact, more affordable, and lighter in weis,ht than conventional small accelerators.",

The desired result of this study will be to determine the feasibility of developing a wheeled vehicle that can operate in the extreme conditions currently reserved for tracked vehicles. The literature search and theoretical analysis will identify the exact properties of the worst case conditions and the traction mechanisms that are successful in each case. Candidate tire designs will be tested in both a controlled environment and in situ to determine actual tractive effort values obtainable with tires. The test results will provide input into a vehicle design that is optimized to make the best use of available traction in all situations. Vehicle weight must be evenly distributed to the tires at all times, and the drive torque distributed in accordance with traction available. This will involve the use of traction control, central tire inflation, long travel suspension, adjustable ride heights and the capability of extremely high ground clearance for operation in deep mud.",

The GaAs resonant tunneling diode (RTD), a two-terminal device, is selected as the active semiconductor element.  Because a two-terminal device will be used, a reflection amplifier mode of operation, as opposed to the transmission amplifier mode, will be employed.  The LNA grid array will be constructed of a tiled pattern of several hundred MMIC devices each containing hundreds of unit cell RTD reflection amplifiers.  The reflecting quasi-optic grid LNA is intended for application on passive millimeter wave imaging cameras where it would overcome the effects of losses in the camera optics to reduce the effective system noise temperature.  On Phase I, single-device RTD's will be designed an fabricated.  They will be tested for DC characteristics and for RF negative resistance and reactance.  The unit cell reflection amplifier element will be designed around this RTD element, then the baseline design for the MMIC will be produced on Phase II, the unit cell amplifier will be fabricated and tested, then the MIMICs will be produced, and the full grid array constructed.  Development of techniques for suppression of oscillations will be an important task on the project.

The concept described is driven by the goal to provide Laser Threat Warning (LTW) with Angle of Arrival (AOA) accuracy sufficient for countermeasures while covering the spectral range between 0.40 and 2.1 utm. Base on these goals, MRC and lIL have combined efforts to propose the ESLTW Receiver (ESLTWR) system, a small, conformal and low-profile laser detection system whose optics can be embedded into the skin of the host aircraft. A goal of the ESLTWR is to address the unique integration issues of the incorporating laser warning on the aircraft. By integrating the ESLTWR optics into the skin to the host aircraft this system will reduce the community concerns on increased vehicle signatures. The proposed receiver not only addresses the eyesafe laser threats but does not neglect the primary threat such as ND:YAG and double YAG. The ESLTWR system extends this coverage via a unique and novel sandwich detector approach consisting of Silicon and InGaAs detectors. Wavelength identification from 1.1 to 2.1 lam is provided to an accuracy of 20 manometers over a field of view (FOV) of 45 degrees. An AOA accuracy of 3 degrees is obtained over the FOV in the spectral band of 0.4 to 2.1 @m.",

        "abstract": "Mohawk Innovative Technology, Inc. (MiTi) has conceived a unique hybrid foil/magnetic bearing design that is compact, light weight and uses a control strategy that optimizes the total bearing system performance.  The hybrid bearing being proposed for this effort builds upon the air Force IHPTET and Navy investment in foil and integrated rotordynamic-magnetic bearing design analyses that resulted in the development and demonstration of a 97 psi load capacity foil bearing with enhanced damping capability and magnetic bearings in a large turbine generator.  With the maximum foil bearing load capacity and temperature capability (1300 F) exceeding that of magnetic bearings, there exists significant potential to develop a hybrid bearing system with capabilities well in excess of either bearing alone in the same or smaller configuration than presently possible.d  In addition, the increased load capacity of this hybrid bearing concept provides needed capability in sustaining transient shock events without the life limiting intermittent rubs that occur in conventional magnetic and backup bearing combinations.  A four-task six-month effort is proposed that will: (1) add foil bearing analysis into the already integrated rotordymanic-magnetic bearing analysis; (2) conduct design tradeoff studies with the new integrated design analysis to assess the benefits of the hybrid foil magnetic bearing in an Army gas turbine engine, using General electric provided engine data; (3) demonstrate the key control strategy needed to integrate these two bearing technologies in a single bearing tester provided at no cost to the program and in the process verify the integrated design analysis; (4) prepare a final report and Phase II proposal for fabrication and test of a hybrid bearing in a rotor simulator representative of an Army engine in collaboration with GEAE.",

This program will develop   the analysis tool needed to design rotor systems using a variety of   magnetic, hybrid and backup bearing configurations, including a   unique Miti zero clearance auxiliary bearing.  A software design   for an integrated rotordynamic-bearing design analysis tool will be   prepared and implemented.  The developed tool will be capable of   predicting rotor and bearing system critical speeds, stability,   response and time transient behavior.  A standard interface will be   used for magnetic (i.e., heteropole, and homopolar designs), gas   (i.e., rigid pad, and bending dominated foil), rolling element   (ceramic and steel) and novel backup bearing analysis modules.   Each module will provide bearing dynamic properties for   rotordynamic evaluation and subsequent bearing load prediction.   The developed tool, which will aid in both the design of new hybrid   magnetic bearing supported rotor systems and evaluation of existing   designs, will be exercised to assess loads and response of   potential rotor-bearing configurations.  The integrated design analysis tool will be used to establish, with   gas turbine manufacturer support, a rotor simulator preliminary   design for use in Phase II.

        "abstract": "This Phase I SBIR will demonstrate the effectiveness of a class of integrators that have properties suitable for long time simulations in reduced-order molecular dynamics.  The current implementation of the MBO(N)D substructured methodology to reduced-order dynamics has already demonstrated orders of magnitude speedup on problems of practical size.  Integrators currently in use for atomistic molecular dynamics have excellent properties of stability and accuracy but are unsuitable for application to the substructured approach due to their inability to deal with velocity-dependent terms.  Conversely the aerospace multibody heritage of the substructured methodology has not provided proper symplecticc integrators thus resulting in somewhat greater long-term energy or momentum drift when applied to molecular dynamics.  Recent  research in symplectic and other integrator families, as well as formulations such as impetus striction provide likely candidates to resolve that dilemna.  In Phase I a number of alternative integrators will be explored and the promising cases implemented in the MBO(N)D/CHARMM codes for testing.  Where substasntial reformulations are necessary a \"pilot plant\" will be built in MATLAB for the comparisons.  In Phase II a full implementation of the optimal integrator/formulation combination will be completed.",

The proposed standar interface system will be based on the Multi-dimensional, User-oriented Synthetic Environment (UuSE). UuSE has been developed at DOE's Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM, and licensed to VIGA Technologie Corporation. UuSE is a wrap-around synthetic environment shell, designed to enha human-computer collaboration.  It is both hardware and software- independent, providing interactive user tools for many desirable functio It is designed for real-time operations, and supports and displays simultaneous heterogeneous environments, e.g., flat screen display, VR display, haptic devices.  It can utilize multiple processor inputs simultaneously, if desired.  It has a demonstrated capability of providi mdata fusionff among disparate data sets and simulations not originally designed to work together. We propose to study the feasibility of extending the range of UuSE capabilities to incorporate all the kinds of data -- real-time, modeled and simulated -- required by the Navy, and to demonstrate the feasibility of providing a standard, generic UuSE software interface for all data fusion needs.",

The best anti-jamming (A/J) performance demonstrated with a GPS receiver to date has been through the use of nulling antennas.  Adaptive nulling electronics have been designed that can support J/S margins of up to 98 dB.  Because of physical size limitations, the use of antenna arrays have been restricted to date to large vehicles such as aircraft.  There is widespread interest in using GPS on small \"smart\" munitions which have been demonstrated to be highly effective in programs such as JDAM and LOCAAS.  In this proposal, an innovative high-dielectric antenna array is proposed that will reduce the array size to within a 6\" diameter.  NAVSYS are currently under contract to ARPA to develop a miniaturized GPS antenna to be embedded in a cellular handset.  Under Phase I, an antenna array design will be developed and demonstrated using this miniaturized patch as antenna elements.

NanTek through its affiliate company, Total Waste Management (TWM), is proposing to utilize such technologies in its development of both fixed and mobile treatment units.  Mobile units featuring DAT is envisioned to be most applicable for treating DoD wastes.  The commercialization of DAT is dependent upon means for economic synthesis and use of ultrafine (nanoscale) metal oxides as destructive adsorbents.  Excellent results have been obtained in the laboratory with specifically prepared (by aerogel/hypercritical drying) metal oxides.  Company affiliated researchers have discovered new nano-particles which have demonstrated marked improvement in the efficacy of the process.  In spite of these discoveries, for DAT to be used commercially, easier and less expensive methods for synthesis of the destructive adsorbents are necessary.  Four new approaches to synthesis will be studied: (1) precipitation of metal hydroxides under controlled pH; (2) impregnation followed by NaOH treatment, drying and thermal conditioning, (3) coprecipitation of hydroxides followed by washing, drying, and thermal conditioning; (4) impregnation of nanoscale MgO with iron salts followed by treatment and conditioning.  Surface areas will be monitored, and destructive capacity determined for various simulants.  Phase II (when funded) will include reactor design and scale-up.",

The system will consist of a novel flat panel R-ray detector, a high speed image processor, a high contrast flat panel display, a simple user input device, and a port for sending the standard DICOM 3.0 formatted images to a wireless or wired network.  This avoids the use of fragile technologies including image intensifer tubes, camera pickup tubes and cathode ray tube displays.  Phase I concentrates on demonstrating that the proposed flat panel detector delivers unprecedented detective quantum efficiency and superior spatial resolution compared to all other techniques presently available or known to be in development.  Other benefits, include a compact flat form factor, large sensing area (ultimately up to 14\" x 17\" or larger) and utility for both real time flouoroscopy and diagnostic still imaging.  When combined with the compact, real-time processor and our rugged, high contrast, low power display, the resulting system will be optimized for deployment in a front line military environment with local display as well as digital transmission capabilties to take full benefit of teleradiology.  Anticipated Military Benefits/Potential Commercial Applications of the Research or Development:  Such a rugged, portable system would permit the elimination of film processing and the resulting need to transport film hardcopy units and transport and dispose of film chemicals.  When combined with field deployable X-ray generators and tubes, full diagnostic imaging capabilities become practical in a battlefield environment.  In a commercial setting, film replacement reduces patient costs, speeds patient throughput, eliminates chemicals and when digitally integrated into a hospital PACS.",

Nonlinear indicia theory offers a viable alternative which can fulfill the Air Force's needs for the efficient and accurate modeling of nonlinear \"plant\" characteristics.  The knowledge of these characteristics is a prerequisite for structural response feedback techniques and control system configuration design.  In Phase I, a neural network model trained on wind-tunnel data will be used to generate the nonlinear indicia responses associated with a wing undergoing large amplitude maneuvers.  The response loads to arbitrary pitch motions will then be compared to those predicted using nonlinear indicia theory.  Innovative and efficient methods based on exploiting finite amplitude maneuvers and short-term history effects will also be investigated for parametric modeling of the indicia response.

Noetek will accomplish this by identifying these key issues, defining and implementing a rigorous systeme engineering trade and study mehtodology and obtaining support form a major HMD producer. Noetek will insure innovativeness by leveraging the state-of-the-art work done by this producer on a current ARPA program which in itself is expanding the Head Mounted Display (HMD) performance envelope.  During Phase I, Neotek will simultaneously investigate and analyze the feasibility of implementing:  (1) alternative HMD display technologies, (2) alternatives to current raster scan technology and (3) alternatives to allow Untethered operation.  These areas will be analyzed concurrently to insure all issues and potential solutions take into account the impact of one on the other.  Results of this much needed study will be a feasibility and development road map for untethered, high resolution, wide field-of-view, bright, full color AUHMD that is light in weight and cost effective.  The first element in the AUHMD road map will be proposed for prototyping in Phase II.",

Training and testing   of this system will be carried out using appropriate data sets from   the large data base of HRR-radar-acquired signatures of known   targets residing at the Wright Patterson Air Force Base.  In performing target identification, the system will optimally   nonlinearly map the observed target signature x into a   low-dimensional feature vector z, and then classify z according to   an appropriate statistical decision rule like Neyman-Pearson's.   For this purpose, the statistics of z will be acquired from the   training data by nonparametric methods.  In order to increase   robustness and accuracy, the system will be implemented in the form   of a hierarchical classifier.  In such an implementation, provision   will be made for bringing information from other sources to reduce   uncertainty through data fusion.  Preliminary results on a limited   data set look encouraging.",

        "abstract": "A distributed computing environment (DCE) provides seamless, location-transparent computation atop heterogeneous hardware and software so that DCE resources are accessible without knowing their location.  However, some technical approaches to location-transparency can be problematic for mobile computers, such as \"notebooks\", \"laptops\", etc., because certain CED technology may be intended primarily for desktop or workstation systems with relatively fixed locations.  One potential problem is inflexible security mechanisms designed for fixed-location systems.  Also, when a complex DCE requires decentralized administration and must be divided into multiple \"clusters\", other mobile computing problems can arise; such as name ambiguity where the same user name or object name could refer to different things in different parts of a large DCE. Furthermore, although portable computers are rapidly increasing in performance and capability, we cannot ignore user needs for low-cost devices with limited capabilities that may not be able to directly implement highly sophisticated DCE software. Our research will define a functional design baseline for DCE portable computing that addresses these problems.  To the extent possible, our approach is independent of any particular DCE technology to maximize dual-use.",

        "abstract": "For more than one hundred years, painters style electrical brushes and various modifications thereof in the form of assemblies of metal wires, were universally used for sliding electrical contacts.  They were replaced by monolithic graphite brushes only at the turn of the century. Monolithic graphite brushes shed Carbon particles as a result of scouring abrasion, and are transferred throughout a generator or motor by the same cooling air used to keep the current-carrying brushes cool.  These particles can bridge microcircuits and/or gaps between the commutator bars, and result in the failure of electronic equipment and/or shorting across the commutator bars causing arcing in the motors/generators.  Additionally, brush waste tends to embed within insulating varnishes, causing low insulation resistance and resulting in component overheating.  In severe cases complete loss of power or class C fire can occur.  Cleaning brush waste has been made more difficult under new environmental regulations that ban the use of chlorinated and fluorinated solvents.  This limits cleaning to non-ionic soap and water, and requires a 7-10 day drying period prior to placing the component back into service.  The restrictive architecture of generators and motors prevents complete removal and neutralization of cleaning solutions, necessitating more frequent cleaning. The major goals of Phase I are to establish the feasibility of (1) demonstrating performance, well above that attained by monolithic brushes, in non-laboratory settings, (2) widening material choices beyond the previously studied copper, alpha - brass, silver and gold, (3) devising strategies for relatively simple replacement of monolithic brushes by fiber brushes in existing systems, and (4) reducing the cost of state-of-the-art metal fiber brushes.",

Problems with temperature stability of these multilayer structures, however, limit the applications and impede the commercial success of devices employing this technology.

The goal of this program is to further develop GMR multilayer materials using the concept of \"overdesign,\" first introduced by Parker, et al, to enhance temperature stability.  The objectives of the program are as follows:  develop DOE's for material fabrication of multilayers and temperature experimentation using the overdesign concept; process multilayer materials with acceptable magnetoresistive and temperature characteristics; test and characterize GMR multilayers; and develop a model of thermally stable GMR multilayers.

The Marathon Transmittor proposed by Nova scales baack the battery current in conjunction with the RF output power, more than doubling the time that a handset could transmit from the same set of batteries.  The Phase I effort culminates in proof of concept transmitter hardware using commerical off the shelf (COTS) components based on a thorough evaluation of the digital battlefield operating requi rements.  The Marathon Transmitter offers the following advantages to handset battlefield communications:                                   Dramatically improves efficiency and LPI/LPD without affecting maximum range.                                                               More transmit time on the air or longer battery interval between recharging.                                                                Equivalent handset performance from smaller battery packs.            Lower battery life cycle cost.",

        "abstract": "A situation awareness system must combine information from many different sensors and platforms and construct a composite air picture for the commander.  Sensors transmit the target position information over data-links.  Due to the large volume of data transmitted over these links, it is essential to conserve the bandwidth of such links by not sending position updates at all times.                                    This proposal seeks to develop an algorithm for minimizing bandwidth demands by using predictive Kalman filters which are widely used in speech compression.  With this technique, the sensor updates are estimated as a function of previous updates, with the predictor coefficients changing as the signal statistics change.  The difference between the actual and estimated signal statistics change.  The difference between the actual and estimated signal is known as the residual signal.  This algorithm will minimize the energy or variance of this signal so that they can be quantized with fewer levels than the original input.  Thepredictor coefficients are calculated by a Kalman filter algorithm. T he Kalman filter is used to identify a predictable component in the signal which can be described by a few parameters.  Bandwidth is conserved by not sending updates if a predicted position is within position oerror requirements, and if maximum bandwidth allications are exceeded.",

This project will develop a method in which high pressure waterjets are added to polycrystalline diamond inserts in a specially designed bit, attached to a hammer drill. The bit will be designed so that high fluid pressure is generated within it, by the action of the main driving hammer.  The addition of the jets to the cutting action of the bit inserts will reduce the overall force required to advance the tool.  At the same time, the rate of penetration will be increased.  Because lower forces are required for penetration, more accurate steering through harder, more fractured ground is allowed.   Phase I will establish the merits of this drilling combination and parameters for optimization.  The component parts to assemble a drilling bit, based upon the combination, will be designed.

However, the rate of penetration (ROP) of drilling tools is limited by the force needed for domed percussion cutters to penetrate into the rock. Polycrystalline diamond coatings have already improved cutter wear characteristics, but they have not been investigated as a method to decrease the cutting forces required for domed percussion cutters. If polycrystalline diamond coatings were highly polished, rock-cutter friction and penetration force would be reduced, and ROP increased. In Phase I, new polishing techniques for polycrystalline diamond coatings on domed cutters will be used to lower the coefficient of friction and the force required to penetrate rock.   Phase II will optimize ultra-low coefficient of friction domed bit cutters for percussion drills for high ROP in different rock types. The degree of polish, the PCD coating, tile cutter placement, size, radius, and shape will be optimized.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee: A new generation of diamond enhancement products for drill bits should increase the usefulness of diamond insert technology by lowering the drilling resistance of rock.

Unfortunately, present   field emission cathodes are strongly dependent on expensive   submicron photolithographic processes while the unreliable   irreproducible emitter operation has hindered large-scale   acceptance of these displays.  To remedy this problem we propose a   novel approach for fabricating nanometer-sized emitter arrays   without the need for many expensive semiconductor processing   tools. Our proposed emitter design will provide very high   emission site densities and excellent yields for field emission   displays.  Our approach to the fabrication of field emitter   arrays is to use a naturally occurring structure as a host for   the tip fabrication. This approach will allow us to prepare   large-area, nanometer-sized structures with high aspect ratios,   which are difficult to form by a conventional lithographic   process.  Our proposed naturally-confined metal field emitters   will prove to be the best performing and most manufacturable   electron sources for field emission displays.

        "abstract": "Improved reading and other near-range visual tasks are among the primary goals of most visuallyimpaired persons. Existing low vision optical aids serve these demands poorly due either to their veryproximate working distance (microscopes), or narrow field of view (telemicroscopes). In addition,current near optical aids can only be used at a fixed working distance. We will develop a novel binocularyoked-focus low vision reading telescope (BRT) specifically designed to maximize optical performanceat a \"normal\" near working distance. The device would be capable of focusing for different distances,would be light in weight, comfortable to wear, offer a wide field of view, and be acceptable inappearance. This concept is derived from our earlier, successful work with the horizontal light pathoptical design of the Vision Enhancing System (VES)TM. Phase I efforts will center upon the developmentof the optical design, yoked focusing mechanism, and mechanical design. A small number of initialprototypes will be constructed for preliminary technical and clinical evaluation prior to Phase IIrefinement and full clinical testing.",

        "abstract": "Currently the floriculture industry is moving off-shore to reduce labor costs.  Automation of labor-intensive operations in floriculture promises to keep U.S. greenhouses competitive.  Unfortunately, the U.S. lags behind Europe in the automation of greenhouses and such technology is not readily available in this country.  We have identified the propagation of geraniums as an application that is ripe for automation.  Currently the propagation (harvesting, cleaning and rooting) of geraniums is entirely manual.  The task is tedious, and a significant effort is expended in training and retaining skilled workers.  We anticipate that with our current methods of production, total costs of production will rise approximately 5% per year.  We will develop technology that freezes production costs while improving quality.  Sepecifically we have identified parts of this cycle that would benefit most from automation.  Recent research results indicate that automation is possible; our main task is to develop systems that are economically feasible.  We propose to:  1) develop a fully automated system that will grade plant cuttings; 2) study three types of automation systems to stick cuttings; and 3) study the changes in greenhouse design necessary to support automation.",

        "abstract": "Today's sensor data fusion approaches typically use some form of an extended Kalman filter to fuse the data.  A basic assumption is that the sensor data is contaminated by additive white noise disturbances.  This is far from being true with some of today's sensors - considering their operation nonlinear regimes: saturation, deadzone, distortion, etc.  In this  proposal, we plan to account for these sensor nonlinearities and uncertainties using a fuzzy logic/neural network approach.  Fuzzy logic is used to account for the nonlinear sensor uncertainty via multiple membership functions for a candidate set of sensor systems.  The neural networks are then used to operate on the sensor data to exploit relationships between the sensors - this significantly enhances the data fusion task.  We propose to use ORINCON's experience in multiple-hypothesis tracking to conceive of virtually every permutation of how sensor data can be fused from within a multitarget scenario.  The neural-fuzzy networks ar inserted to account for the sensor nonlinearities, to intelligently select the proper sensor combinations, and to fuse the data to arrive at the most accurate target definitions (localization and classification).  The blending of the multiple-hypothesis tracking architecture with the neural-fuzzy networks is a computationally efficient and cost-effective approach for sensor data fusion that could lead to more accurate target scene descriptions.",

In the commercial   world, protection of this information from electronic espionage has   become essential.  In the military environment, information   defense, exploitation, and attach have become important components   of warfare.  There is, therefore, a national need to come to terms   with Information Warfare (IW) by developing advanced technology   that can be used both for protecting and attacking information.  ORINCON and Kaman Sciences Corporation propose the development of   an Information Warfare system that combines Distributed Intelligent   Agents (DIAs) with the leading intrusion detection tool, Ice-Pick.   The system, called Distributed Vulnerability Assessment System   (DVAS), uses Ice-Pick's ability to identify vulnerabilities and   distributes network penetrations using ORINCON's DIA technology.   DVAS will permit distributed coordinated attacks on network systems   instead of being limited by the current localized approaches.  Our   knowledge-based approach facilitates continuing upgrades to DVAS as   new vulnerabilities and new systems are encountered.  In addition,   it will accept products and data obtained by other information   system sources (spin-on), thus keeping the system current as new   information becomes available.  This powerful system provides tremendous potential for spin-off to   other sectors, including commercial and other government systems.",

        "abstract": "With their proven performance, reliability, and low cost, inductive loop sensors are widely employed in traffic monitoring and control.  However, the presently used preformed loops suffer from frequent breakage induced by traffic or repaving operations - a need exists to develop a preformed inductive loop that can survive these stresses.  Additionally, the performed loop should be immune to changing environmental conditions, should withstand abrasive materials and movement of the pavement, and should be resistant to sealant chemicals and petroleum-based contaminants from road vehicles.\n\nORINCON proposes to develop a Flat Cable Loop design to address the deficiencies of presently available preformed loops.  In particular, the design will aim to prevent loop breakage due to thermal and mechanical stress associated with repavig operations and roadway traffic, reduce the cross-section size to fit a 3/8\" saw cut, and minimize the connector size between the loop and the home run cable.  The loop will be easy to configure and install in the field.\n\nIn Phase I, ORINCON will formulate the specifications for wire insulation materials, the home run wire, and connector materials and fabrication.  To make the design a viable commercial alternative to the presently available preformed loops, the Flat Cable Loop will be supported by thorough cost analysis of materials, manufacturing, and installation.

        "abstract": "A problem of current interest to the Air Force is the automatic analysis, detection, and classification of potential critical component failures in rotating machinery.  Current processing for health monitoring of parts uses relatively simple metrics or features to measure and characterize changes in vibration data recorded from several sensors.  An alternative solution is to use neural nets coupled with appropriate feature extractors.  Neural nets have been used extensively and successfully at ORINCON to solve multisensor and multifeature detection and classification problems in mechanical systems, as well as for sonar and radar problems.  Neural networks assume no underlying model for the events of interest.  Rather, the neural network \"learns\" to detect and classify faults by examination of features from training data which have known fault conditions.  In Phase I a demonstration system that uses multiple feature extractors coupled with a hierarchy of neural nets to solve the problem will be developed.  The detection and classification system will be extended in Phase II to perform fault prognosis as well.  The system will be demonstrated processing real data supplied by the Air Force.",

        "abstract": "Current fiber optic links designed for high dynamic range applications use distributed-feedback (DFB) semiconductor lasers that only operate over a narrow temperature range.  Thermoelectric coolers are ordinarily required to maintain the laser within the operating temperature range.  This limitation translates into cost, size, complexity and power consumption that are too high for many applications such as phased arrays, wireless communication and broadband communication systems.  Today's DFB lasers do not maintain single frequency operation, which is crucial for low noise operation, over a wide temperature range.  We propose a program to study Multi-Quantum-Well (MQW) laser which will lead to a wide temperature range DFB laser that will operate from -40 to 85 degrees C without a thermoelectric cooler. The performance capability of a DFB laser rather than a Fabry-Perot laser is needed in high dynamic range applications, especially those that require fiber lengths exceeding a few kilometers.  The program objectives include establishing quantum well designs to achieve optical gain characteristics that permit a DFB laser to operate over a wide temperature range, modeling to predict dynamic range performance, and fabrication and measurement of laser structures based on these designs. designs which will lead to a wide temperature range DFB laser that will operate from -40.",

        "abstract": "Voltage surge-induced electronic failures represent a multibillion dollar problem for the U. S. and world microelectronics industry.  Typical sources of voltage surge are electrostatic discharge from the human body, line transients from parallel AC power fluctuations, and lightning strikes. In military and missile electronics there exists the particular threat due to electromagnetic pulse (EMP) which can be simulated by a nearby lightning strike. In the actual electronic circuit, the present key step taken to \"deflect\" over-voltage from hitting the IC device is to place in parallel to an integrated circuit device, a surge arrestor. These vary from metal oxide varistors (MOV) to diodes to gas discharge tubes with each satisfying various operating parameters including trigger or \"clamping\" voltage and response time. The proposed research focuses on a technology which represents an inexpensive alternative. This is the use of a metal-polymer composite which can exhibit desperately needed combination of low clamp voltages, low capacitance and fast response times.  This research is designed towards the more extensive investigation into this materials design approach in order to vastly improve such a device's reliability and powerhandling capability. It is also expected that such research will also shine far greater light on the general theory behind such a material's basic physics. In Phase I we will demonstrate the feasibility of creating such a device and in Phase II we will scale up to address reliability and reproducibility issues.

Implementing these types of simulations using standard techniques may not be sufficiently innovative for a SBIR; however, P. C. Krause and Associates (PCKA) have developed methods which could markedly improve the speed and facility of these simulations. In particular, a method has been developed which permits a detailed simulation of an ac power system which is orders of magnitude faster than standard methods. It is proposed to apply this technique to high-power machinery systems. Secondly, PCKA have developed a technique to extract information from an accurate reduced-order simulation and, using this information, reconstruct the instantaneous steady-state waveforms including harmonics, without resorting to a standard cost-prohibitive detailed digital simulation. It is also proposed to apply this technique (waveform reconstruction) to high-power machinery systems. If successful, this research would yield an accurate systems simulation environment for in-house use by the government and industry, not just to investigate pulsed power systems but to study a wide range of high- power machinery systems.",

Current assay technology is capable of detecting quantities of bacteria, viruses, and toxin molecules to levels as low as 10-12g.  Introduction of the collected material into some assay devices requires sample reduction to liquid phase.  An advanced material called aerogel will be investigated for utility in an automated collection subsystem.  In terms of aerodynamic filtration efficiency, aerogel has outstanding potential due to its nanometer-size pore structure.  The porosity of aerogel reaches 99.8% which could produce an ultra-low pressure drop that directly reduces power consumption.  The inner surface area of this material is approximately 1600 m2/g and it may be possible to treat it with reactants to enhance the entrapment of biological agents.  The most applicable property for this research is that aerogel can be made either hydrophilic or hydrophobic.

Creare proposes to develop a heat blanket that will maintain a constant uniform temperature over the entire surface. More specifically, we will first determine and fully document specifications for the blanket. Then,based on these-specifi- cations and the.innovative approaches described later in this proposal, we will select the best approach for further development. A detailed design will be developed using this approach. To support the design work, a thermal model will be developed to predict the blanket's temperature distribution.

The final design will be the starting point for our Phase II effort, in which a blanket will be fabricated and thoroughly tested.",

        "abstract": "Our innovation is a composite component, consisting of a micromachined metal substrate overlaid with solid electrolyte, that will greatly increase the power density of AMTEC and sodium sulfur battery systems.  The approach is to uniquely fabricate a porous substrate in part by micromachining with a laser and then to sputter-deposit a microscopically thin (10 micron) layer of b\"-alumina solid electrolyte (BASE).  A substrate structure which permits very thin (@ 10 micron) BASE is the key to development of the composite and will improve the power density (W/cm2) of the electrodes by 50%.  It will enable the power conversion cells to be constructed with the electrodes as flat plates, resulting in a power-per-unit-volume four times greater (@ 2 kW/liter) for an AMTEC system module at a high conversion efficiency (3 35%).  In Phase I, we will demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating our micromachined porous substrates and sputter-depositing micro-layers of BASE.  In Phase II, we will complete the development of the micromachining and deposition processes, and we will demonstrate the improved power density in operating AMTEC modules.|  Benefits:  The benefits of the proposed composite substrate/thin-BASE configuration are 50% greater electrode power density in AMTEC cells or sodium-sulfur batteries.  It enables a flat-plate electrode configuration which will improve the energy-per-unit volume (specific volume) by a factor of four in AMTEC systems for satellites and hybrid electric vehicles.  The flat-plat electrode configuration will also reduce the size of sodium-sulfur batteries used in submarines and may be enabling technology for these batteries to meet the power density requirements for hybrid electric vehicles.|",

The opportunity presented here is to   eliminate these problems by developing an onboard advanced   distillation oxygen system (ADOS) consisting of a cryogenic   refrigerator and a compact, lightweight, flight-worthy   distillation column which will provide a supply of liquid oxygen   to one or more standard aircraft LOX dewars.  The cryogenic   refrigerator portion of the proposed system will be based directly   on one of two systems currently under development by Creare for the   AF as components of advanced hybrid oxygen systems (AHOS), which   employ molecular sieve oxygen generators.  The primary focus in the   proposed project is the development of a lightweight, compact,   flight-worthy distillation column capable of producing highly pure   oxygen.  The Phase I program will consist of a detailed design   study, which will specify the optimal thermodynamic cycle, and a   preliminary design of the distillation column.  To justify further   development, the ADOS will be evaluated against the AHOS currently   under development and other existing aircraft oxygen systems.",

Such a small detector volume is achieved by the special electrode structure and gas flow pattern. In Phase I, the detector structure and function will be optimized with the use of a test fixture which examines the metastable helium ionization performance with a coupled mass spectrometer for mass identification. A new generation of micro-sized gas chromatograph columns requires a micro-volume detector for the measurement of organic chemicals, oxygen and water, down to parts-per-billion. A theoretical model for understanding the detector's operation can be based in part on the research results already achieved by PCP, inc. under Contracts NAS2-12997 and NAS2-13276, entitled Ion Mobility Sensing of Extraterrestrial Volatiles from a Gas Chromatograph. For NASA, the further reduction in detector size leads to a reduction in utilities (gas) requirements and weight in space flight instrumentation.",

This approach avoids the need for distributed turbulence. Each effect can be independently established allowing a broad range of conditions to be simulated. Furthermore this approach allows each effect to be carefully controlled providing a quantitative and repeatable simulation. Another feature of the concept is that recorded field data can be used to control the simulation allowing observed. real conditions to be simulated in the laboratory. Three tasks are included in the program. The first addresses simulation requirements based on the careful analyses of selected optical systems and operational scenarios. The second will assess the available hardware which can be used to build the simulator. The final task will develop, in some detail, a preliminary design for a system which can be integrated into an existing Navy hardware in the loop laboratory facility.

Closely spaced fragments cannot be resolved and the arrival of the blast wave can result in unreliable screen performance.

This project will develop a gas sensor which operates at room temperature, making it better suited for routine, extended flights.   Phase I will integrate a previously demonstrated sensor concept (for H20 detection at 1.39 \u00c2\u00bfm) with new approaches for detection of  CO2,  N20 , and CH4 at wavelengths between 1.52 and 1.65 \u00c2\u00bfm. Phase I will result in demonstrated detection strategies, sensitivities, and measurement precisions for all species; a demonstrated temporal response; and a complete conceptual design for a compact, integrated sensor that can be deployed on a Perseus-type UAV.  Phase II  will consist of development, fabrication, and limited flight testing of a prototype UAV sensor payload, followed by delivery of the prototype to DOE.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee: In addition to unmanned aircraft application, a high sensitivity water vapor sensor should find commercial application in feed gas analysis and process control for the semiconductor fabrication industry.  A CH4 sensor should find comrnercial application as a fenceline, long path monitor for fugitive emissions from naturai gas pipelines and processing facilities, and from chemical manufacturing plants and Jandfills.  A CO2 sensor should find applications in monitoring and validation of the performance of combustion systems in industrial and utility environments, and especially in aeropropulsion engine emissions control.",

        "abstract": "This proposal describes a novel active control system to improve the stability of low-NOx gas turbine combustors.  The control scheme is based on using inlet fuel flow modulation to influence the unsteady mixing and heat release processes in the combustor to provide real-time control over combustion stability.  In the proposed Phase I program, the control system will be adapted to an existing laboratory-scale spray combustor by installing a fast-response sensor and actuator coupled to a PC-based controller. An optical sensor will be fiber-optically coupled to the combustor to monitor luminous emission in the flame stabilization zone.  The sensor will be used to detect combustion instability which is manifested in oscillatory burning.  When combustion instability is sensed, the PC-based controller will send a control signal to an auxillary high-speed pulsed fuel injector to instantaneously increase mixing and combustion intensity in the flame stabilization region.  This will lead to a local region of intense burning to stabilize the flame and reduce the combustion oscillation.  The successful application of this control scheme to gas turbine engines will result in more stable, compact, and, efficient low NOx combustion systems.",

Removal and concentration of uranium from soil by cropping with heavy metal accumulating plants will significantly reduce the cost of stabilization and subsequent disposal.  By concentrating the metal in the plant tissue, harvesting the biomass and stabilizing the dried residue, the mass and volume of waste are reduced by up to 95%.

Although oxide VCSELs have spectacular performances (50% wallplug efficiency, etc.) their manufacturability is questionable since the oxidation process forming the current aperture is highly sensitive to temperature, time and aluminum concentration.  Furthermore, the oxidation processes may continue after fabrication, albeit at a slower rate, and degrade reliability. In contrast, the proposed VCSELs would have their current apertures defined by photolithography. Since the apertures comprise lateral oxidation barriers, the oxidation process is greatly suppressed within the apertures, enhancing reliability. The process employed to produce the lateral oxidation barriers has a wide, but reasonable, parameter space which requires some optimization in order to preserve the high performances of oxide VCSELs. This parameter space is best explored via experimentation rather than by calculations. Phase I will fabricate simple test structures with a wide range of the possible parameters, test them, and determine whether the process can produce practical oxide VCSELs.

However, the joining of tungsten tiles (3-5 mm thick) to copper substrates remains a critical issue. Most contemporary joining techniques (welding, fastening, etc.) can not be used. Brazing and diffusion bonding may make joints possible, but these technologies are difficult to use on large curved reactor surfaces. This project will use innovative functional gradient technologies to strongly join tungsten to copper alloy heat sinks without the use of silver or gold. The copper/tungsten functional gradient maximizes the integral bonding of the dissimilar metals while minimizing thermal strains that would otherwise develop. Divertor mockups will be made and thermal cycled at ITER heat fluxes to prove the superior thermal fatigue life of the innovative functional gradient joint.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  Commercial applications include furnace crucibles, rocket engine combustion chambers, high temperature containment assemblies for hazardous materials, welding electrodes, MHD generator electrodes, etc.",

This project will develop such a system which will allow for single wavelength, ultrashort pulse operation (10J/pulse, 400fs pulsewidth, ~1 \u00c2\u00bfm wavelength) and dual wavelength, high pulse energy operation (60J/pulse, 4ps pulsewidth, 1.05  \u00c2\u00bfm and 1.06  \u00c2\u00bfm wavelengths).

        "abstract": "It is very important to develop a simple, safe, and reliable system for coordinating cancer brainsurgery while it is actually being done. This is true for simple stereotactic techniques and also true forresections. Currently there are a number of devices that allow integration of pre-operative stereotacticcoordinates to intra-operative use. This allows tumor localization and a high degree of accuracy, at leastat the beginning of surgery. The major problem is that as the surgery proceeds, and as the brain eitherrelaxes or swells, and as some tumor is removed, the coordinates change. In this regard, it would benice to have ultrasound guidance during the operation which was initially coordinated with stereotacticinformation derived from 3-D stereo computer reconstruction with prior MRI or CT scans in stereotacticspace. But, in fact, the use of ultrasound is probably the only way of carrying out this real-time, on-lineguidance, since the use of both CT and MRI for this purpose would be unfeasible froth both a physicaland financial viewpoint. In addition, CT would involve x-ray exposures, and MRI presents a strongmagnetic field and would require the use of only non-magnetic metallic instrumentation. On the otherhand, the ultrasound probe can easily be placed on the brain, either through an adjacent hole in the skullor through the surgical brain access.",

        "abstract": "The objective of the Phase I effort is to develop a design configuration of a magnetically suspended reaction wheel for a small satellite.  This configuration will be developed in close collaboration with well-known commercial suppliers of reaction wheels.  It will use novel magnetic bearings that are radially passive and made of permanent magnets with high energy density.  These bearing are robust, thus facilitating high speed operation.  These use only one actively-controlled axis, thus saving the power that otherwise would have been consumed by the complex control electronics.  These novel magnetic bearings support the reaction wheel without contact, thus ensuring long life.  In Phase I, we will develop the design configuration of the reaction wheel for a typical small spacecraft.  This will be accomplished by conducting a complex trade analysis between the low-power, light weight and high torque requirements of the reaction wheel and the speed, stiffness and damping capabilities of magnetic bearings.  The analytical configuration development effort will be enforced by an experiment task to test critical bearing elements for their high speed operational capability.  An optimally designed magnetically suspended reaction wheel design configuration is the end result of this effort.  Benefits:  Successful development of these reaction wheels will be useful in a growing number of commercial satellites such as IRIDIUM and TELEDESIC.  These reaction wheels will also enhance commercial applications of space such as cellular phones, remote sensing and surveillance.  The passive magnetic bearings developed herein can also be used in several energy storage devices such as electric vehicles, utility power storage, etc.  They also find applications in many markets such as refrigerators, auxiliary power units, air cycle machines and machine tool spindles.|",

This approach, based upon significant departures in technical concept and approach, prvides ease of control and reuse of complex models.  It has broken the barriers to modeling complex systems, yeilding the very high resolution models required to insure validity.  This is done by achieving model independence through graphically enforced architectual design rules and a fully automated user-friendly environment.  This success has resulted in huge simulations that meet customer validity constraints and has promted the need for even higher levels of simulation integration. As an extension to the above graphical CAD approach to model design, PSI has developed a simulation run-time graphic system to illustrate the activites of the simulation as it unfolds and interact with the simualation as it is running. For the Phase I effort, PSI proposes to explore and demonstrate advanced run-time graphics facilities for heirarchical icons chich support, for example, the deployment of an aggregate facility such as a shelter, and the puch-down of this facility into basic entities, such as various switches of different types, with appropriate graphic interaction at each level in the heirarchy.

        "abstract": "We propose to determine the feasibility of using diode-laser-based, full-spectrum Raman scattering technology incorporating fiber-optic coupling for rapid, continuous, on-line detection and monitoring of key intravenous (IV) drugs.  Raman's narrow, well-defined peaks and insensitivity to water offers potential for full-spectrum Raman detection of drug levels in blood with parts per millions (ppm) sensitivity for many commonly administered drugs within 30 to 60 seconds.  Traditional Raman scattering performed with visible light excitation is not compatible with physiological samples because of background fluorescence.  Conventional gas lasers have too short of a life and are too expensive for routine commercial instrumentation.  A semiconductor laser diode offers longer life than conventional lasers and can operate at near-IR wavelengths where sample fluorescence  is minimized while taking advantage of the very sensitive and full-spectrum detection.  Fiber-optic coupling allows the safe application of Raman scattering in medical environments by isolating (optically) the patient from electronic equipment and offers the potential for multiplexing several patients within a multiple bed recovery room.  Phase I will demonstrate through bench studies the feasibility of applying diode-laser-based Raman technology to the measurement of commonly administered drug formulations and will determine the commercial market opportunity provided by closed-loop control of important IV drugs such as anticoagulants (heparin) and injectable aesthetics (propofol).|  Benefits:  Currently, the dosage of most drugs such as anticoagulants and anesthetics is determined by the patient response or effect rather than actual drug levels in the patient's blood.  Raman scattering technology offers a method to continuously measure these and other drugs during surgery in over 3 millions procedures performed in the U.S. each year.|",

We will build upon extensive research/development that has already been performed by the Naval community in fender/bumper design.  This effort will focus on the unique properties of elastomeric matrix composites and how they can be integrated into existing bumper/fender designs or utilized in new designs.    Production Products will develop a uniquely tailored bumper design concept capable of long life and optimum energy dissipation under impact of both large and small vessels. Key to design of affordable elastomeric matrix composite (EMC) fender/bumper systems, is using low cost manufacturing processes.  Design options will be heavily influenced by affordable processing approaches for EMC materials to produce high quality bumpers at low cost.  Production Products will build on our previous experience fabricating fiber/polyurethane composites for NSWC and ARPA.  In Phase I we will identify system requirements, design criteria, and candidate designs.  We will also characterize EMC materials mechanical and energy absorbing properties and perform a trade study to down select to a single optimized concept and two potential fabrication approaches for full scale development and commercialization in Phases II and III.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this proposed effort is to research and develop innovative methods for supporting COTS (VME) architectures independent of their applications, users, or vendors. Great emphasis and priority has been placed on employing Commercial-Off-The- Shelf (COTS) equipment for military applications.  To this end, it is becoming commonplace for designers to develop systems which are based- primarily on widely embraced VME architectures.  As history has shown, supportability can pose significant cost and risk issues during all phases of system development and deployment.  The difficulty of this problem increases as multiple hardware and software products are integrated to provide complex functionality.  This is due primarily to the fact that each of the commercial suppliers and developers address the supportability problems with a different set of test devices, software tools, and philosophies.  The migration to COTS has also introduced new wrinkles to system development due to reduced module hardening.  The intent of this effort is to research the alternatives available to establish a common approach to testing and supporting these common architectures.  An effort has also been made to address other typical system shortfalls such as system longevity.",

The project will focus on advancing DNA sequencing and reducing its cost by creating a new enzyme that eliminates the need for an oligonucleotide primer to initiate DNA synthesis at a defined site, and that can use dideoxy nucleotides for chain termination. The new method should reduce the time and cost required to obtain DNA sequences, and enhance the speed and cost effectiveness of current DNA sequencing technologies.  Phase I will purify mutant polymerases, develop protocols for rapid small scale mutant enzyme purification, evaluate the purified mutants for properties relevant to DNA sequencing, develop facile mutagenesis schemes, and produce mutant RNA/DNA polymerases with altered promoter recognition.  Phase II will refine properties of the mutant by: (1) expanding the number of mutations examined using the purification protocols, assays, and mutagenesis screening methods developed in Phase I, (2) examining the effect of each mutation on enzymatic properties important to DNA sequencing applications, and (3) optimizing conditions for sequencing performance.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Anticipated products include systems for direct sequencing of plasmid and phage DNA without the use of oligonucleotide primers to initiate synthesis. These reagent systems should be easily incorporated into high throughput, automated DNA sequence analysis systems, and should be compatible with other sequencing technologies and with existing commercial cloning vectors and PCR fragments used for sequencing applications. Other commercially useful properties may include the ability to incorporate modified nucleotides for non-isotopic detection of nucleic acids, and the facile production of ssDNA.",

In this Phase I project, the feasibility of developing an efficient and effective mathematical model which is capable of incorporating the dynamic characteristics of fasteners, their interfaces with the host structure, and the host structure itself will be investigated. Such combination will result in a significant gain in computational speed and improvement in accurancy of the numerical results which produce a better prediction. The model will be adaptive based on the closed-loop dynamic relation between fasteners and the host structure.

        "abstract": "We propose to develop a battery powered portable monitoring system capable of collecting and analyzing gamma spectra for specific radionuclides in the field. The system will consist of a high resolution cadmium telluride array detector and a small multichannel analyzer and data logger.  The proposed  monitoring system builds upon the design of the Ludlum Model 2350 Data Logger which is quite rugged and can operate for extended periods of time on battery power. The data logger will be reconfigured as a small multichannel analyzer that will integrate under specific regions of interest and report results by isotope on a large LCD display.  For large projects the instrument will have the capability of dumping its data to a notebook computer.  The detector will consist of spectroscopy grade CdTe crystals in an array, with individual preamplifiers to preserve the detector resolution.  The detector array should have a resolution of 5 - 7 KeV at a photopeak energy of 60 KeV which is sufficient to identify most nuclides, and is particularly effective for the low energy photopeaks associated with transuranic radionuclides.  The CdTe detector operates at room temperature and does not require cooling.  The research should lead to the development of a small, rugged gamma spectrometer capable of rapid isotope identification.  The instrument should be suitable for safeguards and other field applications.  As you know, AM has been operating under a beta-test of the new network-based/Windows-based AM Tracking System since 13 May 1994.  The beta-test has allowed us to develop knowledge of and confidence in the new system while maintaining a a backup in the original PR Tracking.  In keeping with the original implementation plan, the beta-test is now declared completed and maintenance of the original PR Tracking system will be discontinued immediately.  Negotiators are no longer required to submit hard-copy corrections using the Tracking printouts.  Updates are to be made to individual actions in real time, at a minimum on a daily basis.",

It also is the most significant and highly variable atmospheric constituent in the formation of weather and the transfer of atmospheric heat.   Yet, it remains one of the most poorly characterized of meteorological parameters.  Radiosonde balloons remain the most common method of profiling atmospheric water vapor, despite their high cost, inaccuracy, and noncontinuous nature.  There are no all-weather remote sensing technologies, in existence or in development, that can remotely profile water vapor.  Other known technologies are defeated by the presence of clouds.  This project will apply a new microwave technology to the profiling of atmospheric water vapor.   Monolithic  microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) technology will be incorporated in a  prototype profiling radiometer, based on advanced hardware and mathematical inversion methods.   This radiometer will be operated in parallel with  radiosonde balloon  releases to evaluate its performance.  \n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  The all weather proposed water vapor profiler has applications in weather and climate research and modeling as well as in global change.  The profiler also is the missing element in a replacement system for radiosonde balloons.  The National Weather Service, Federal Aviation Administration, and foreign equivalents are therefore prospective customers.",

It is clear that the emphasis of the system must change from 'acoustic channels' to-'acoustic target sources' at least in the initial search phase. A new and innovative data fusion technique is proposed. A high level search display methodology which builds on the current display formats is also proposed. The Phase I product will be a robust data fusion algorithm which can be implemented with minimal cost and risk.

Decontamination now requires use of special formulations that may not be readily available, and which can cause damage to equipment due to their caustic or strongly oxidizing components.  The best solution would be to treat surfaces with a coating containing a catalyst that could deactivate common chemical agents without the need for further decontamination formulations.  Unfortunately, no such coating is currently available.  TDA Research, Inc., (TDA) has identified a route to such a catalytic protective coating, which we call the self-decontaminating surface (SDS).  This coating will utilize dendrimers as a catalyst, because the high catalytic activity for the deactivation of chemical agents shown by certain dendrimers. In Phase I we will first test subsystems, including design and synthesis of dendrimer catalysts best suited for the SDS coating. We will then prepare and test coated surfaces, demonstrating both catalytic activity and resistance to environmental challenges, including sunlight, petroleum liquids, and detergents.  Phase II, if warranted, will improve performance, provide coatings for tests on DoD materiel, and develop methods for large scale production.",

Locating the point of entry of a munitions impacting water is one particular application of this more general skill.  The particular detection system sought by topic AF96-203 of the current DOD SBIR solicition provides RSI with an opportunity to assemble an integrated product development team whose members have experience in a variety of related areas including acoustic transport, hydrophone detector sytems, munitions and high velocity impacts, marine hardware and marine navigation systems, software development, and systems integration.",

The technology uses the unique optical properties of chiral films to achieve wavelength division and polarization discrimination multiplexing of read channel signals. The storage medium, which can also be card or tape formats, consists of 1,000 or so information-carrying layers coated with a patterned chiral thin film. The chiral film is obtained with innovative vacuum deposition techniques. As an example, a 10-mm thick disc of diameter 120mm has a storage capacity of 650GBytes, if an infrared (\"lambda\" = 0.78um) laser is used for data retrieval. This corresponds to an equivalent volumetric density of 7GByte/cm(3).  With parallel readout, a data transfer rate greater than 150GByte/s is possible. More importantly, the proposed optical storage technology can utilize advances in short-wavelength diode lasers to increase the storage capacity even further. Furthermore, the 'backward' compatibility provides a natural and viable migrating path for rapid introduction to the market.",

The proposed IORS offers improved three-axis resolution through a unique, temperature independent biasing technique.  The distinct advantage of an IORS over other gyro architectures in the present application of smart munitions is that it is the only gyro with the possibility of surviving 100,000 g accelerations.  The proposed IORS has no moving parts, and its rugged glass-on-silicon waveguide architecture also lends it the ability to withstand hostile thermal and acoustic environments.  It is lightweight and compact, and consumes a minimum of electrical power.  It requires trivial signal processing.  I fact, of all the optics-based gyroscopes (ring laser gyro, fiber optic gyro and IORS), only the integrated optics gyro can be easily mass produced at low cost.  A simple basic design can be customized to meet the performance specifications for a number of military and commercial applications.  The outcome of this project will be a set of design specifications for the construction in Phase II of a prototype three-axis IORS compatible with the requirements of smart munitions.",

This lack of commercial adoption of DPR is not, however, due to a lack of commercial uses for DPR.  In fact, a huge variety of applications could benefit greatly from the unique features that DPR networks offer: completely self-managing peer-to-peer communication with very rapid and reliable \"no-fuss\" deployment, no service fees, adaption to mobility and dynamics and automatic extension of network coverage as new radios are added.  This lack of commercial adoption has instead been caused by a few key barriers that are impeding its transition into commercial markets:  Too Needy    DPR requires more processing power and memory than today's commercial wireless networks.  Too Risky    The DPR protocols are complex, not generally well-understood, and perceived as risky.  Too Different    The selling of DPR products requires new and different marketing and business models from existing wireless network products and services.  The goal of this Commercial Distributed Packet Radio (CDPR) effort is to lower these key barriers currently impeding the commercialization of distributed packet radio technology.

        "abstract": "Recent advances in processing concepts for waveguide fabrication in NLO polymers offer the potential for precise local control of refractive index gradients within polymer thin films. These index control approaches can be used to create large, buried, single-mode waveguides for low loss pigtailing to optical fibers. The same techniques can also be used to create buried, 3-dimensional waveguide tapers within the films which smoothly transition to smaller waveguides within the electroded regions of optical devices for greater electrical responsivity. This allows the use of small waveguides which can experience higher electric fields to greatly reduce drive voltages. Advanced processing is also proposed for these smaller guides so that they tightly confine light (small, single-mode waveguides having large refractive index gradients) to eliminate the major source of optical loss in narrow electrode gap designs, the absorption of evanescent light by nearby metallic surfaces. Feasibility demonstrations of these new processes in conjunction with other techniques such as ion etching are proposed for developing innovative approaches for reducing pigtailing cost, reducing optical losses, and reducing drive voltages in integrated optical devices. The processing of such NLO polymers holds great promise for ultrafast (50 GHz), high performance components and interconnects. Besides military applications such as active interconnects, radar detection, and RF communication, this development offers great potential for cable TV and telephone industry applications.",

        "abstract": "One of the Operation Directorate's top ten challenges is the development of handheld gas chromatography (GC) instrumentation for CW treaty verification.  Toward this challenge, DNA has recently developed and reduced to practice innovative new technologies for low power, fast GC.  An unsolved technical issue which still remains with small, portable GC devices is how to conduct fast and automated vapor sampling without exposing the normally hot surfaces of GC inlets directly to the environment.  Such hot surfaces prevent the unwanted condensation losses of semivolatile CW-related vapors within the sample inlet, but constitute a fire and explosion hazard for operation of the equipment in industrial sites.  This safety concern could ultimately prevent the use of this instrumentation in its application, the inspection of industrial chemical sites for offending chemicals.  A novel approach to an automated safe inlet/vapor preconcentrator is proposed which eliminates the exposure of hot surfaces to the environment, yet provides automated fast sampling.  Further, the proposed design can simplify small GC instruments, significantly increase GC sensitivity (reduce detection limits), greatly enhance preconcentrator performance, increase GC reliability, and simplify preconcentrator maintenance.  This safe inlet concept would also have utility beyond small GCs.  A feasibility demonstration is proposed.",

The objective of this proposal is to define through parametric development the sol-gel synthesis and process conditions necessary to form lithium chromium oxide (s) which reportedly can cycle reversibly very large amounts of lithium and have optical properties compatible with the EC device applications. SAGE Corporation - in collaboration with a group of research specialists at Rutgers University's Center for Cermaic Research (CCR) and and at Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (3M) - propose to synthesize, characterize and evaluate films of lithium chromium oxide. A sol-gel processing route under conditions which will lead to chromium oxide. A sol-gel processing route under conditions which will lead to chromium in higher oxidation states will be used. These film materials will be incorporated in both lithium battery and EC test devices. The electrochemical behavior of physical vapor formed lithium chromium oxides. If the gel-derived film materials prove as high in energy density as expected, attempts will be initiated to prepare gel-derived poweders suitable for use as the cathode in lithium polymer batteries.

Preliminary calculations show that a lightweight low volume alternator similar to the Chrysler turbo-alternator, having similar specific power densities can be developed.  Phase I of the proposal will be the development of a lightweight, low volume alternator and a high efficiency power electronics drive to control and drive it.  Various alternator configurations will be designed, and the best will be developed to make the best use of optimum semiconductor technology.

The combination of a large diameter rotor, high energy-product rare earth magnets, and a large magnet length permits brushless power generation capability well in excess of that specified with good voltage regulation and efficiency.  SatCon has developed and analyzed two preliminary designs for permanent magnet generators, both of which are roughly 5.5 inches long by 15.5 inches in diameter and weight 75kg.  Initial analyses indicate that the first, a 3 pole-pair design, can generate 10 kW at 1200 rpm, while maintaining a voltage regulation of better than 4% and an efficiency of better than 99%.  This same machine, with forced air cooling, however, can deliver 26 kW, while maintaining a voltage regulation of 10% and winding losses of 570 W.  The second design, a 2 pole-pair design, will deliver 20 kW at 1800 rpm with a voltage regulation of better than 5% and an efficiency of better than 99%.  With forced air cooling, it can deliver 39 kW, while maintaining a voltage regulation of 10% and winding losses of 570 W.  Liquid cooling would allow greater generating power capacity. If required, greater magnet length will improve voltage regulation.  The Phase I will proceed through requirements definition, design tradeoffs, and detail design to arrive at a optimum design which would be built and tested in a Phase II.  Emphasis will be given to thermal management, efficiency, voltage regulation, and mechanical ruggedness and mounting.",

        "abstract": "This exploratory development program is devoted to the development of an automated electromagnetic field probe to measure the electromagnetic fields in an anechoic chamber.  The approach is based on the use of SATIMO's innovative rapid electromagnetic field measurement technique that scans large test areas or volumes in a few seconds or minutes, compared to the hours of measurement time required for conventional mechanical scanning.  This novel technique is referred to as the Advanced Modulated Scattering Technique (A-MST), and employs arrays of modulated scattering elements to provide electromagnetic field measurements at Nyquist sampling rates.  The richly sampled measured field data allows accurate processing by advanced imaging codes such as SATIMO's Augmented Diffraction Tomography (ADT) algorithm or the MUSIC algorithm to determine the relative strengths and locations of chamber reflections.  The customized A-MST Automated Electromagnetic Field utilizes a linear array fo dual-polarized modulated scattering probes to provide the requisite Nyquist-samples measurements of the scattered microwave fields at sampling rates of 2,000 to 20,000 points per second.  Module simulations and proof of principle measurements will be performed 1) to demonstrate the basic operating principles of the A-MST Automated Electromagnetic Field Probe and the ADT and MUSIC imaging codes and 2) to determine critical design parameters and expected performance envelopes for the Phase II prototype system.  One of SATIMO's existing A-MST electromagnetic field probles will be used to conduct the anechoic chamber reflection measurements.",

These advances are compromised by today's sources of hydrogen, which are bulky, heavy, and inconvenient.  WJSA proposes to solve this problem by storing H2 at very high pressures (6000-9000 psi) in glass microspheres and packaging the microspheres in a dense layer on a strip of polymer film.  For transport and storge, the film would be wound into cartridges just like photographic film.  In use, the film would be drawn through a set of rollers to crush the glass microspheres, releasing the stored H2 at a controlled rate. This concept, called Energy Film, promises to be the first safe, convenient, lightweight, reliable, and inexpensive source of H2, suitable as a replacement for heavy batteries.  We show that we can store H2 at energy densities (4-10MJ/kg) superior to today's compressed gas bottles.  In addition, we obtain the safety inherent in storing H2 in myriad(1011/kg) independent storage volumes.  In the future, resupplying electronics with H2 in the field will be as convenient as loading a modern camera with film.",

Using   EM fields can replace the deployment of chemicals that pose a   danger to the environment.  Chemicals have to be brought to the   fire, which most likely involves ground transportation.  Ground   transportation necessarily requires time.  It is anticipated that   in case of an electro-magnetic fire suppression concept response to   a fire call could be made by helicopter, since only energy, in this   case most likely diesel fuel, has to be transported.  In the   proposed concept an electrostatic field is applied to the fire to   precondition the flame for acceptance of a strong electro-magnetic   pulse.  This pulse is deployed by a loop-type antenna and will   introduce an eddy current in the flame proper.  The magnetic field   of this eddy current is opposite to the field that is emitted by   the loop antenna and will therefore be repelled by it.  The effect   is that the flame will be blown out.  For the Phase I effort a   device will be developed capable of extinguishing a small area (30   cm squared) pool fire.",

The Phase I program will consist of construction of the pump laser and design, construction and testing of the two OPOs.  The experimental data will test our understanding of the characteristics of the OPOs and provide a basis for future development in a Phase II effort.

To address this need, we propose to develop and demonstrate a tunable, single-frequency, solid-state laser capable of being directly diode-laser-pumped to generate output powers up to 100 mW in the 1300 nm to 1750 nm region.  This project will address the issues of tunability, spectral purity, lowering pump threshold, and optimized conversion efficiency.  A robust unidirectional ring reasonator design using birefringent filter tuning will be optimized for the laser material and wavelength region.

P-GILD uses a pulsed, 200-watt-class excimer laser as an illumination source to produce ultra-shallow, low-sheet resistance, box-like and retrograde impurity profiles in silicon without the use of high temperature anneals or conventional ion implantation.  P-GILD thus meets all of the criteria for fabricating optimized deep-submicron devices.  The P-GILD process requires a factor-of-20 scale up in average power from the production-worthy excimer laser technology now developed for 0.25 micron DUV lithography.  It was only through the use of all-solid-state pulsed drivers that the 10 watt KrF lasers recently developed for DUV lithography were able to achieve the component lifetimes and cost of ownership required  to make these lasers economically viable.  In Phase I, SRL will work closely with Cymer Laser Technologies, the leading supplier of excimer lasers for DUV lithography worldwide, and Ultratech Stepper, the developer of the P-GILD process, to develop a detailed engineering design of an all-solid-state driver for a 200-watt excimer laser designed to meet P-GILD process requirements.  In the Phase II effort, SRL will develop and deliver this prototype excimer laser driver to Cymer for integration on a high power excimer laser head and for extensive test and evaluation.",

Current techniques are expensive, require extensive maintenance, and are personnel-intensive.  A non-lethal means of delaying or restraining unauthorized intruders without harming them is sought.  This project will evaluate the feasibility of high power acoustic fields as a non-lethal barrier technology for use in nuclear facilities.  In Phase I, a site survey of a candidate facility or suitable surrogate will be performed to help establish requirements for the system; analytical models, developed for previous efforts, will be used to support the selection of the appropriate technology and approach to installation; and a conceptual design of a prototypical system will be developed.  In Phase II, preliminary and final designs of the barrier system will be developed, and the system will be installed and demonstrated.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee: The advanced barrier system for nuclear facility security should meet the requirements of a non-lethal system.  Commercial applications of high power acoustic technology include crowd control/law enforcement applications, pest control, and accelerated removal of toxic containments from soil and groundwater.",

        "abstract": "The received signal in an airborne surveillance radar array is   referred to as a space/time process, wherein the spatial   connotation arises from the spacial diversity of the antenna array   elements.  In general, the received signal contains target,   receiver and jammer noise, and spatially-distributed ground clutter   components.  A radar space/time signal is often represented as a   one-dimensional (1-D) vector (multichannel) process.  The 1-D   vector representation has been adopted extensively in the   development and analysis of optimum joint-domain and sub-optimum   block-covariance algorithms for target detection and interference   rejection.  Alternatively, a space/time signal can be represented   as a two-dimentional (2-D) scalar process.  The 2-D representation   is essentiaal for visualizing an dunderstanding the spectral energy   and correlation characteristics of the total signal, and of the   gound clutter component in particular.

        "abstract": "High speed packet switched networks provide numerous challenges for machine learning based control.  In this proposal, we address the problem of scheduling the transmission of packets in an ATM switch supporting multiple traffic types with different delay and loss requirements.  We propose an adaptive transmission scheduling algorithm, called Urgency Scheduling, that combines elements of memory based function approximation, reinforcement learning and dynamic programming.  The resulting control will be validated by testing it with realistic traffic followed by direct comparison with standard service disciplines.  Specific Phase I tasks are: (i) Perform a State-Of-The-Art survey of adaptive scheduling algorithms for B-ISDN applications with a focus on the usefulness of machine learning in terms of cost effectiveness, performance, and implementation for cell scheduling in C3I based ATM networks.  (ii) Reformulate the Urgency Scheduling algorithm to investigate specific features of the model, especially, the sensitivity of performance to model parameters.  (iii) Run the simplified model using off-line or simulated ATM data.  (iv)  Identify the learned strategies and investigate their implementation in a fuzzy rule-based framework.  (v)  Prepare final report describing results, Phase II recommendations and applicability to C3I systems.

Although the work done in preview control for active suspension has advanced a great deal over the last 27 years since the pioneering work of Bender (1968), several important issues still need to be addressed. These are:  1.  Saturation and rate limiting of actuator control inputs, which are not considered directly in the LQR formulation. 2.  Robustness of control design to uncertainties in vehicle dynamics and preview information  3.  State estimation and parameter identification to mitigate the effects of sensor noise and parameter variations.  4.  Nonlinear dynamics due to friction, hysteresis, backlast, etc.  5.  Failure Detection, Identification and Accommodation.  6.  Improvements in sensors and actuators for preview information and active control  7.  Real-time implementation of control laws on available microprocessors.  We propose here for Phase I the methodology of Model Predictive Control (MPC) to address the issues of control saturation, nonlinear dynamics, on-line adaptation and failure accommodation. The remaining issues will be addressed during PHase II.  Specific Phase I technical objectives are:  1) Problem formulation, data acquisition and simulation for preview controlled active suspension.  2)Design of robust Model Predictive Control (MPC)  3) Controller tuning, robustness analysis and performance evaluation using simulation and UC Berkeley Active Suspension Test Facility. 4) Implementation and input data requirements for MPC preview controlled active suspension.

        "abstract": "The capability for the AWACS radar to detect both hovering and moving helicopters has become increasingly important since many countries now use helicopters in conducting military operations.  Improved situation awareness by AWACS crews of helicopters may aid in avoiding repetition of recent fratricide of US helicopters by F-15's in Iraq.  The AWACS radar is optimized for the detection and tracking of high speed aircraft targets in performing its mission of airborne surveillance and command and control.  As such the system has not been optimized for detection and tracking of helicopters which fly at lower speeds, hover, and which have unique radar signatures.  The use of innovative processing to better extract the helicopter signatures from the background clutter and target environment combined with new waveforms currently under consideration by Wesinghouse can contribute toward an improved radar capability for helicopter detection.  the following classes of innovative DSP techniques are proposed for solving the helicopter detection and classification problem.   (i)  Model-based spectral estimation methods which have been shown to perform much better than FFT in terms of resolution accuracy, reduction of false alarms and the extraction of key target features.  (ii)  Flexible Template Matching (FTM) algorithms for characterization of discriminating target features using both time domain and frequency domain data over multiple dwells.  (iii)  Neural networks and Wavelet methods for target feature extraction and classification which have been used successfully on SAR imagery as well as RAR data.Westinghouse Electronic Systems, the developer and manufacturer of AWACS radar, will provide technical and evaluation support during Phases I and II and commercialize the results in Phase III.",

        "abstract": "Cross wind is the largest component in the error budget for sniper weapons used to engage targets at long range.  Current technologies to estimate cross wind rely on visual cues or on a point measurement of the wind at the shooter's position.  The cross wind is also assumed to be constant between the shooter and the target.  These estimates for cross wind deflection are often inadequate for ballistic wind corrections.  To overcome this deficiency, Scientific Technology, Inc. proposes an innovative laser system that can measure real time cross wind between a distant target and the shooter.  The system will meet laser eye safe standards.  The sensor will also be able to integrate with the range detection to the target.  Atmospheric turbulence-induced optical scintillations have long been a problem to astronomical observations.  However, it has also been realized that observations of the twinkling of stars and the motion of scintillation patterns yield information about the turbulence and the wind speed in the upper atmosphere.  This proposal addresses a technique which takes advantage of the atmospheric turbulence-induced optical scintillation as a means to measure cross wind along a line-of-sight path.  Potential commercial applications abound for open path optical scintillation  technology.  In addition to military and law enforcement applications, general areas where this technology will have a major impact include the environment, aviation safety, meteorology, and recreation industry.",

Recent experience with the THAAD missile shows that while motor instability can be solved after it occurs, it is not currently designed out of missile systems before the propellant is cast.  The product proposed here is to add to the rocket motor designers tool kit, a multi-dimensional capability for acoustics stability analysis which can be utilized as an adjunct to a grain design and internal ballistics analysis.",

        "abstract": "This proposal investigates the feasibility of a secure transaction   manager (STM) for defining and implementing policies that govern   when and how DBMS transactions can be executed.  Database   management systems and transaction processing systems use the   concept of a transaction to organize and control the manner in   which application programs can access network resources, including   databases and file systems.  Transactions allow application   programs to combine operations on multiple different network   resources into a single atomic operation.  The STM acts as a connection and filter between the client   application and various DBMS servers on the network.  It provides   the ability to run atomic transactions that access multiple   databases on different networks and extends the security and   integrity controls provided by commercial DMSs by allowing   additional policies to be defined and enforced on these   transactions.  for example, integrity policies could be defined   that prevent data from being accessed or modified except via   certain predefined transactions,  In a commercial environment,   this allows a wide variety of organization specific policies to be   implemented.  In a Department of Defense environment, this allows   special transactions to be identified that have the ability to   execute at several levels and that can be verified to not leak   classified information.  Such transactions provide a secure   approach to sharing and updating information between single-level   databases on networks at different levels.",

Current clock generation techniques are limited by the available bandwidth of the electronic approach, or the bulky configuration and fixed rate of the optical approach. SLI's TGOCG is based on mature GaAs/InP technology, which can provide miniature configuration and high integration capability with standard opto-electronic integrated circuits (OEIC). SLI's TGOCG will provide a cost-effective clock generation solution for the next generation of diversified optical systems.

        "abstract": "New technologies are required for the next generation of EHF communication systems.  As the volume of information between  space platforms and the earth increases innovative technologies will be required which will allow efficient communication.  SSG proposes an innovative CRFC form of SiC as a revolutionary material for communication antenna reflectors.  Its primary benefit is a significant reduction in antenna weight (5 to 8x compared to MILSTAR satellite requirements).  This weight reduction has numerous benefits for future communication systems:  1) decreased power requirements; 2) increased lifetimes; and most importantly 3) significantly decreased launch costs for space-based systems.  The CFRC SiC system proposed offers the additional benefits of being more durable and reliable (due to superior materials properties and monolithic fabrication capabilities) and providing increased thermal stability (due to materials properties and athermalized design capabilities).  These benefits can be realized at a production cost which is less than half of that associated with present technologies.  Demostration of the proposed technology requires three milestones:  1) Development of near-net-shape fabrication techniques, specifically for antenna reflector substrates; 2) demonstration that the CFRC SiC can maintain the surface figure and surface roughness required by antenna reflectors; and 3) demonstration of the thermal stability of the CFRC SiC.  The objective of the proposed effort is fabricate and test a proof-of-concept antenna reflector; and fabricate and test a prototype reflector in order to demonstrate the benefits promised by the innovative technology.  The potential weight/cost savings associated with the proposed technology have been recognized by the MILSATCOM joint program office (MJPO).  A support letter outlining MJPO's interest in the proposed technology is attached.|  Benefits:  The proposed ultra-lightweight antenna reflector technology promises to significantly reduce the weight and therefore the launch costs associated with both military (i.e., MILSTAR secure communication satellite system) and commercial communication systems.  The weight savings are significant enough to reduce launch vehicle requirements and deployment costs, and in this way opening up entirely new markets in the global communications arena.|",

Sensors Unlimited and the David Sarnoff Research Center have already teamed up to commercialize distributed feedback lasers with power outputs above 10mW.  The primary application has been the sensing of gases such as O2  (0.761mm), HF (1.321mm), H2O (1.393mm), NH3 (1.541mm), H2 S (1.575mm), CO2 (1.602mm), CH4   (1.653mm) and CO2 and H2O (1.952mm).  In Phase I we will design our structure, fabricate a 1.55mm TA-MOPA device with a goal of >100mW output above 1 watt, and deliver nine final units.  Dr. Ray Martinelli of David Sarnoff Research Center will consult on the program.|  Benefits:  High power, coherent 1.5-1.95mm lasers are currently scarce and many new applications are anticipated.

        "abstract": "US military weapons and C4I systems are heavily dependent on digital computer technology.  Operational success demands very high performance and reliability.  Mission failures, aborts and delays are extremely expensive and can result in casualties.  Inevitably, technology faults are caused by bad quality, design flaws and/or a hostile environment created due to an act of war or nature.  As a result, military aircraft, ships, submarines, and other critical applications are prone to mission downtime and support needed to keep these critical systems up and running is an unnecessary drain on an already shrinking military budget.  There is an urgent need for an effective yet affordable solution, to reduce the cost of the increase in failures due to the fast growing complexity and use of digital technology.  Shawn Systems is currently performing ongoing SBIR work on an innovative solution, that will yield digital computers capable of offering orders-of-magnitude higher performance and reliability than what is to cluster upto \"n\" digital computing nodes to provide distributed processing, automatic load balancing and auto-configuring fault tolerance.  In other words, zero performance degradation or loss of data due to selecting \"application specific\" configurations that are capable of handling the predicted mission performance requirements and expected hardware/software failures.  Also, these clustered nodes provide multiple Input/Output paths to allow redundancy to be extended throughout the application --- making the entire application more robust.",

        "abstract": "The world wide communications infrastructure is undergoing dramatic revision, with optic fiber providing virtually limitless bandwidth, and wireless communication connecting increasingly mobile users to that fiber backbone.  However, cost-effective evolution to an information-rich society will require strong standardization of wireless communication technology. The United States gave birth to the spread spectrum technology embodied in the mobile telephony and personal communication service (PCS) standard IS-95, and three of the five major PCS consortia have recently adopted IS-95 as the basis for their service.  The other two have selected wireless technology based on the International Standard GSM, which uses frequency-division/time-division multiplexing (FDM/TDM) rather than IS-95's code-division multiplexing (CDM) to share the linited spectrum resources among many mobile users                  This SBIR effort explores the relative sensitivity of these competing standards to cochannel interference.  It investigates adapting a processing technique based on cyclostationary equalization, currently used to eliminate the impact of jamming in modems for military applications, to mitigate the interference sensitivity of IS-95.  The Phase I SBIR effort will demonstrate how this technique can be integrated with commercial IS-95 modem technology to provide a seamless backward-compati ble interference mitigation solution.  Phase II will demonstrate a fully functional IS-95 modem incorporating the new processing.",

The aluminum metal is a stable low cost fuel that increases specific impulse and burn stability, but also introduces several undesirable effects primarily attributable to molten particle agglomeration and the formation of the reaction limiting Al2O3 on the particle surface. These effects limit the oxidation reaction rate and utilization efficiency of the aluminum powder. In this work an innovative nanocomposite aluminum powder with ultra-high surface area will be developed that has the potential for extremely high reaction rates, full utilization of the aluminum material and the future potential for an integrated fuel/oxidizer system. A patented ultra high speed nanotechnology vacuum process will be used to produce a material that is composed of thousands of aluminum nanolayers separated by polymer nanolayers. A nanocomposite aluminum particle can have hundreds of very thin aluminum layers, resulting in a very high surface to volume ratio; expected to increase reaction rate, powder oxidation efficiency, reduce nozzle erosion, and produce an environmentally cleaner exhaust.

The object of the proposed effort is to demonstrate that standard DS-0 (64 kb/s) level service can be transmitted successfully over the HF channel and that, by doing so, HF can be effectively integrated into an ATM backbone. The proposed effort will investigate several innovative modulation and antenna techniques for high speed HF data communications. The effort will benefit from several previous studies by Signatr on on advanced HF communications and from similar past \"order of magnitude\" advanced created by Signatron for troposcatter and underwaqter communications. THe high proposed data rate makes complexity of the implementation a key issue since intersymbol interference can span many symbols and since the fast fading of the HF channel eliminates the most simple approaches. We have identified several potential modulation waveforms that are candidates for resolving this issue. THe Phase I effort will use computer simulation to guide the design choices for the design that will be recommended for prototype implementation and real-time testing in Phase II. Anticipated Benefits: Long range communications can be significantly cheaper using radio, and is certainly more flexible, than fixed cable or satellite. This radio resource can not be taken advantage of unless it is compatible with new standards such as ATM. Applications include mobile and quick reaction data links over ranges of many hundreds of miles, capable of multimedia communications (data, voice, fax, image, video,...).",

Because a GTO rated to turn off 2000 A typically requires a turn-off current of 800 A, the most unreliable feature in GTO applications is the gate circuit that provides this high current turn-off pulse.  The MTO incorporates the main features of proven GTO technology to achieve the highest available voltage, current, and thermal stability.  However, the MTO incorporates a high impedance turn-off gate structure based on an MOS transistor which allows for a much smaller, lower cost, and potentially much more reliable gate circuit. Furthermore, the turn-on gate of the GTO can be preserved in the MTO or, optionally, it can be replaced by a buried gate structure for faster operation. SPCO has already demonstrated a 6kV / 1200 A hybrid version of the MTO.  The integrated MTO, which will provide the highest system reliability, requires that an MOS transistor be fabricated directly on high-voltage device wafers.  This necessitates further detailed simulation and design efforts for both the device physical properties and for its fabrications processes.",

A MEMS glucose assay system is presented in detail to illustrate that even a relatively simple single cuvette consumable has near-term promise as a commercial product.  Design considerations are discussed in sufficient depth to show how this system can be extended to many analytes other than glucose.

The TPV cell will be grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth techniques and consist of an InGaAsSb double-heterostructure fabricated on a 2\" GaSb substrate. The InGaAsSb composition will be lattice matched to the GaSb substrate to eliminate dislocations at the growth interface, a common problem with InGaAs based TPV cell technologies. A p-on-n configuration will be used to reduce overall free carrier absorption for the incorporation of a back surface reflector. TPV cells comprising InGaAsSb quaternary material systems and GaSb substrates are expected to have better performance characteristics than existing cells at this operating wavelength as a result of decreased dark currents and the ability to incorporate effective back surface reflectors for reduced operating temperatures. The Phase I efforts will utilize Sarnoff's previous experience developing AlGaAsSb/InGaAsSb quantum-well lasers operating out to 2.7 micron, to establish the growth parameters for appropriate material compositions and doping profiles followed by cell manufacturing and testing at SMI. SMI will optimize the front and back contacts for high current extraction and transmission at the surface and maximize reflection at the back plane. The cells will be evaluated for both material and performance characteristics. In Phase II, the structures will be further refined for increased efficiency by modeling the performance characteristics of the Phase I cells.  Characteristics such as the spectral response and series resistance will enable optimization of crucial structure parameters including optimum layer thickness and doping. We will also test the cells using a prototype fuel module.",

SSC now wishes to expand its product development to include domestic poultry food products containing capsaicin for the purpose of decreasing rodent infestation in poultry production plants.  In addition, capsaicin directly increases resistance of poultry to infection by Salmonella.  SSC has formulated both chick starter and adult layer feeds with capsaicin in the form of red chili pepper and at a final heat strenght of 5000 Scoville Heat Units (303 ppm capsaicin).  Chickens raised on this feed for six months showed no preference vs. control feed, and grew at the same rate as birds raised on control feed.  Mice offered this feed in a two-choice feeding study demonstrated complete avoidance.  Research is now needed to produce a more cost-effective feed that will reproducibly discourage mice and rats from eating it, and to determine the effect of red cayenne pepper and/or decolorized oleoresin of capsicum on laying hen and broiler chicken performance and sensory qualities of eggs and broiler meat.",

This project provides a system which will efficiently sort and count fish with minimum manual labor without harm to the fish.  One novel aspect is the ability to sort and count fish by length or weight by using both photoelectric and ultrasonic sensors.  The unique fish handling system will separate fish from each other and guide them through the sensor section.  The information from the sensors will measure the fishes' length and width.  From this data, the weight of the fish is deduced.\n\nThe initial program is a feasibility study of the variables involved in fish handling, size detection and weight prediction.  The program will begin by working with minnows as durable substitutes for trout of fingerling sizes.  Phase I efforts:  1) develop fish separator and diverter technology; 2) develop and incorporate the photoelectric system; 3) adapt existing ultrasound methods to fish width detection; 4) integate the system elements into a computer controlled prototype unit; 5) examine techniques required to cause fish to enter the grader system; 6) perform field trials on the system to gather operational data.",

This approach provides information on the type and location of the fire, while the simultaneous measurement of multiple gases greatly reduces the chances of false alarms.  The instrument is self-calibrating and self-checking to reduce long term maintenance costs.

        "abstract": "This proposal addresses a key issue for flat panel display printers which will aid the poduction of higher quality displays and enable the US manufacturers to capture a significant market share.  This issue, stage precision, is required for good overlay and stitching performance, and translates directly into improved grayscale performance and higher pixel resolution.  Existing flat panel printers have a stage precision of approximately 150 nm, and air turbulence is the major contributing factor to that budget.  Dual-wavelength interferometry provides a way to compensate for air turbulence.  This approach is based on the simultaneous measurement of the optical path at two widely-based wavelengths.  The difference between the path length at the two wavelengths is related to the amount of air in the path.  The innovation developed at SPARTA is the use of second harmonic interferometry to measure the path length difference directly and provide a precise determination of the air content of the beam path (4 nm 3 sigma).  This system is currently being developed for application to IC manufacturing.  The payoff will be the future ability to fabricate higher quality displays using the existing MRS Flat Panel Printer.  Because display quality is a key selling point for high end laptop computers, it is a highly leveraged factor in the sales of consumer goods.  Access to high quality displays by US manufacturers will provide a valuable boost to US manufacturer sales for consumer electronics.  Anticipated Military Benefits/Potential Commercial Applications of the Research Development:  Flat panel displays are a key component of military and commercial portable systems.  Currently, nearly all flat panel displays are made in the far east.  The high capital costs of setting up a flat panel display manufacturing line have prohibited setting up production in the US to meet our low volume military needs.  This work could result in a significant advantage for US display manufacturers leading to a significant commercial market share and assuring reliable supply of this critical component for military uses.",

        "abstract": "Current CRT phosphors rely upon 3-12 micron sized semiconductor grains to convert the electron beam emitted by the cathode into light. These phosphors suffer from low conversion efficiencies (25%), and efforts to improve these systems over the past few decades by altering the stoichiometry have resulted in only minor improvements. Quantum Dot Phosphors(TM) (QDP(TM)) of doped and undoped II-VI semiconductor compounds have the potential of becoming the next generation of phosphor materials, clearing the way for larger, brighter screens with higher spatial resolution. Surface passivated, direct band gap emission QDP(TM) differ from bulk grains in that their small dimensions (diam. of 3 nm) result in a highly localized electron hole pair. With the defect surface states of the nanocrystal passivated, the probability of the localized electron hole pair recombining radiatively is greatly enhanced. The quantum dots, which are more than 1000 times smaller than standard phosphor grains, provide better spatial resolution. In addition, the doped nanocrystals can result in an increased number density of active centers, which is likely to yield higher saturation values under high current density excitation. The goal of the Phase I effort is to develop direct band gap semiconducting quantum dots of CdS along with doped ZnS dots with activator ions including Ag+ and a host of transition metal ions. We will synthesize the quantum dots with proprietary wet chemistry methods and evaluate the electrical and optical properties with a phosphor evaluation CRT system, donated by Sony Corporation.",

The state of the art in lasers and electro-optic and signal processing components enables the development of a compact, rugged, and reasonably priced instrument with ppm-level sensitivity.  In Phase I, a proof-of-principle experiment will be conducted and preliminary design will be developed for a Phase II prototype instrument.|  Benefits:  In addition to Air Force applications, a major commercial market exists for monitoring trace combustion products from gas turbine and conventional power plants.  Continuous emission monitoring is required for the toxic products NO and CO as well as NH3, a byproduct of NO control chemistry.  In addition, accurate measurement and control of the CO/CO2  ratio in the exhaust would facilitate the optimization of burner combustion efficiency.|",

        "abstract": "The switching of optical signals is an enabling capability for the fiber backbone of modern communication networks. Reasonably priced products with the required bandwidth and speed are still unavailable after years of effort and the application of many interesting technologies. Most work to-date has focused on the development of high speed, very expensive technologies. These products have experienced varying degrees of market rejection.  Pixel Communications proposes to develop a Photonic Switch capable of routing light without first translating the optical signal to electrical format. The proposed switch is a bulk optic, critical angle device that takes advantage of total internal reflection and the controllable birefringence of a non-linear material to guide collimated light. The unique aspect of the simple yet elegant (and patented) design is the application of liquid crystal material to the switching device. Polarized light is guided into and out of the device by collimating lenses at the fiber-switch interfaces. The individual switch element will be \"stacked to form large switch arrays. Phase I of the effort will focus on materials development and technology integration. Phases I and II will pave the way for the Photonic Switch becoming technically validated, commercially practical, and operationally robust.",

        "abstract": "The proposed project will develop a new technology capable of producing highly reliable npn heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) using carbon-doping. Carbon is a very slow diffusant and has a higher solubility in GaAs than more conventional dopants, such as beryllium or zinc. A carbon-doped HBT base will provide sharp emitter-base np junctions with a simplified design. Spire proposes to achieve high quality carbon-doped (5 x 10 19 cm-3) np heterojunctions capable of sustaining accelerated-stress life tests. Spire has already succeeded in carbon doping GaAs grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) using trimethylarsenic, and has demonstrated doping up to 10 20 cm-3. Trimethylarsenic appears to be the best candidate for replacing carbon tetrachloride, an ozone depleting gas banned by the Montreal Protocol, as a carbon doping source. The proposed work will expand the GaAs carbon-doping technique to In0.53Ga0.47As, a material of great interest for InP-based power HBTs. MOCVD is an alternative approach to molecular beam epitaxy particularly suitable to the high-quality high-volume HBT products that will be derived from this work. Phase I will demonstrate that Spire's approach is capable of producing high reliability np diodes. Ga0,.51In0.49P/GaAs and InP/Ga0.47 In0.53As np heterojunctions having carbon-doped p-layers and designed to mimic the HBT emitter-base junction will be grown, fabricated, and tested. While InP-based HBTs are potentially higher power devices than GaAs, the advanced state of GaAs manufacturing technology gives it a compelling advantage; both material systems should therefore be explored as the basis for high performance power HBTs. Accelerated stress life tests will validate our approach.",

Nano-size crystallite films will be fabricated using ion beam assisted deposition, and the relationship between crystallite dimension and mechanical film properties (hardness, wear resistance, friction, and ductility) will be investigated.

SRICO proposes to develop a prototype RF Voltage Measurement System based on a directly coupled voltage to optical converter.  This design uses advanced electro-optic technology.  In this approach, RF isolation is provided by a photonic interface which converts the RF voltage to an intensity modulation of an optical carrier.  The RF modulated optical carrier is then detected, amplified and applied to a square-law detector to obtain a DC voltage proportional to the RF signal. This novel approach provides for measurement of high voltages, greater than 1000 Volts, and improves the operating bandwidth to frequencies greater than 100 MHz.  For this Navy Phase I, SRICO proposes to use state-of-the-art integrated optic technology to design a small, compact voltage sensing package with accuracy better than 10 ppm. A major benefit of SRICO's photonic approach is that not only can continuous wave and chirped RF waveforms be accurately measured, but so can pulsed waveforms and pulsed-cw signals.",

The performance and economy of solar thermal propulsion in this application are dependent upon deployable solar collectors of low weight and high accuracy.  Collectors in which the optical shape is maintained via pressurization is a primary candidate; however, this approach involves risks from meteoroid or debris damage.  A candidate approach to reduce this risk, involving foam-rigidizing the reflector surface after deployment, has been proposed by SRS Technologies and Thiokol Corporation.  Inflatable concentrators have a long history of interest for use as large space structures due to the high packaging efficiency and simple deployment.  However, gas inflated structures deployed on long term missions require make-up gas due to the inherent permeability and leakage caused by punctures from small particle impacts.  This proposed effort will exploit recent successes in constructing inflatable concentrators and foam rigidizing efforts.  The proposed work consists of foam shrinkage minimization and in-vacuum inflatable concentrator deployment and foam rigidization.  Optical testing in vacuum will be performed to characterize the shape of the concentrator after inflation and rigidization.|  Benefits:  A higher performance and lower cost means for delivering payloads will be of benefit for both government and commercial payload launches.

We propose in this work to   investigate how the weaknesses of different sensors can be reduced   through the processing of the collected data before it is viewed in   order to enhance desired targets (e.g., weapons) and reduce   undesired noise and clutter.  Among the technologies to be   investigated are the millimeter wave and infrared.  Disadvantages   shared among all sensors are:  clothing penetration, range, and time   needed to display the data.  Because the disadvantages are mutually   exclusive, the only way to satisfy all three of them is to either   improve the sensors' hardware in collecting data or introduce   signal processing procedures to enhance the data before it is   displayed.  We suggest doing the latter and use the Automated   Statistical Characterization and Partitioning of Environments   (A'SCAPE) processore which uses two separate procedures to   determine all homogeneous regions and sub-regions in the scene.

        "abstract": "In Phase I, we will investigate a case-based reasoning (CBR)  approach to intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) and explore the  feasibility of semi-automated/automated course authoring  techniques to speed collection and structuring of domain  knowledge.  We will develop a prototype example-based ITS,  enhanced with multimedia, within a specific Navy instructional  domain and a generic ITS architecture applicable in many other  domains.  The use of an ITS for individual or team training will  achieve many of the same benefits as one-on-one instruction.  Additionally, an ITS can promote instructor productivity, cope  with higher skill requirements for trainees, provide tailored  instruction and remediation, while allowing flexibility in  teaching methods.  When ITSs are enhanced with interactive  multimedia, students demonstrate greater motivation during  training and greater retention of course material.  Thus, an ITS  provides instruction that is at once cost-effective and  potentially superior to traditional classroom teaching methods.  An example-based approach offers the further benefits of  automatically or semiautomatically generating the student's  mental model and of largely circumventing the difficult and time-  consuming process of constructing an explicit expert mental  model.  Furthermore, the more examples presented to the student,  the more likely it is that the student will be able to apply the  concepts in new situations.  We have used this CBR approach with  much success in other training domains.",

It will also demonstrate the ability of MBR to also find causes of anomalies and CBR to increase the efficiency of the MBR search. The prototype will interface to an existing satellite simulations.  Also in Phase I, we will design the Phase II system which will use CBR and MBR to resolve anomalies in real-time for on satellite subsystem, interface to the MAGIC system, and be easily updated for new satellites.  Hughes will provide satellite anomaly resolution expertise, cases of anomaly resolution, models, actual telemetry, simulations, potential users, and commercialization avenue.

TRIP steels offer the potential of serving as inherently SMART, high-strength structural fastener materials in critical aircraft locations since they can be formulated to change solid-state atomic arrangement(s) as a function of applied strain.  Originally developed as ultra-strong and tough (fracture resistant) structural alloys, TRIP steels experience a martensitic phase transformation which can be tailored to occur within the elastic range (stress-assisted) or within the plastic range (strain-induced).  The parent face-centered-cubic, austenitic phase is paramagnetic and displays no significant ferromagnetic response whereas the product, body-centered-cubic martensitic phase is ferromagnetic.  The peak elastic stress in a SMART bolt can be deduced by the ferromagnetic response displayed by an elastically-loaded TRIP steel which experiences a stress assisted transformation, or the peak, post-yield, strain level can be deduced from a TRIP steel which undergoes a strain-induced transformation.  Five to seven TRIP steels will be melted, fabricated to plate form and evaluated in the laboratory.  Three configurations of prototype bolts of the optimize alloys, will be fabricated and simulation tested as part of the interim program.",

        "abstract": "The technology for reliable real-time video communication between air cockpit to base, cockpit to cockpit and missiles to cockpit is of great importance in modern electronic warfare.  Since the channel bandwidth for such a video-link is highly restricted due to limited transmission power and security require- ment, efficient video compression technique is essential.  It is also desirable to incorporate error control and recovery mechanism for data protection and to allow real-time operations.  Thus, there are three areas requiring technological breakthrough: data reduction, coding speed and error resiliency.  Novel approaches for solving these problems and integration of different modules into a system are detailed in this proposal. This proposal consists of work plans for both Phase I and Phase I Option.  In Phase 1, we will investigate state-of-the-art low bit rate video coding, which is mainly based on the H.263 standard, and develop a fast motion estimation algorithm for real-time processing.  We will also focus on incorporating error control and recovery technology into the video coding scheme so that it is robust to the channel errors in wireless communication.  In Phase I Option, we will establish a wireless communication channel model and perform extensive simulation and conduct a performance evaluation. The same technology also finds many commercial applications, including multimedia transmission, teleconferencing, videophone, high-definition TV (HDTV), and CD-ROM storage.  We plan to utilize the work in Phase I to develop a prototype hardware for handling real video test data in Phase 11, and demonstrate the developed hardware in existing Navy tactical aircraft and transfer the technology to commercial applications such as mobile multimedia communication and cellular videophone in Phase 111.",

The sky and background radiances have complex temporal, spectral and angular variations.  Surface treatments also vary in their bidirectional and spectral optical properties.  Surfaces can be diffuse or specula, and vary spectrally depending on surface roughness.  The spectral content surface depends on the material composition and can also be tailored spectrally.  An optimal solution can vary with viewing angle and environmental conditions.  This proposal is to develop a simplified engineering design tool to allow the LO engineer to effectively develop optical requirements for minimizing target/background contrast.  The application will be based on first-principles treatments of surface BRDF and heat transfer.  The application will perform local, diurnal and seasonal optimization based on modeled or measured backgrounds.  The output will initially be a set of parameters defining the optical requirements of the optimal surface treatment.  Ultimately this will be tied to the surface material composition.  Also, the application will be coupled with a library of paint optical measurements and in additional output will be the \"best fit\" realization of the optimal solution, and contrast histograms of its performance in the selected scenario.",

It will then evaluate several competing technologies--Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing, and Tabu Search--to find which would produce the best system at the best price.The subject of \"weapon-to-mission\" allocation (i.e., aircraft, tank, radar, etc.) is one of the main issues THUNDER was designed to.  A frequent objection to this analysis technique is that the chosen allocation represents a deployment of unknown effectiveness.  Automating the search for highly effective air alloctions can counter such objections in two ways:  primarily by finding allocations that are empirically much more effective than those currently being developed by human analysts.  All three techniques--GA, SA, and TS--show promise on problems such as this; problems which have poorly behaved objective functions and large and irregular solultion spaces.",

        "abstract": "The increasing complexity and size of spacecraft has aggravated the problem of packaging a spacecraft for launch and subsequently deploying the spacecraft in its operational configuration.  The motors and spring-driven deployment mechanisms and their associated release /latch devices are single-point failure sources, with significant failure potentials due to launch loads, thermal cycling, and the space environment.  Several technologies such as shape memory alloys and electrostrictive/magnetostrictive materials, are beginning to emerge as possible replacements for these deployment mechanisms.  Saddleback Aerospace has devised several deployment schemes based on a new candidate material:  a shape memory ploymer.  The polymer should offer low cost, lower weight, easier attachment and greater design versatility than existing or emerging technologies.  In the proposed Phase I program, candidate roles for shape memory polymer actuators will be evaluated, and two prototype actuates will be fabricated.|  Benefits:  The development of shape memory polymer space actuator mechanism will benefit the design of all classes of satellites and spacecraft, particularly the newer class of LEO and MEO communications satellites.",

In this project, ultacapacitor electrodes will be constructed electrochemically from ceramic electrode materials.  These materials will significantly enhance the volumetric energy storage density and reduce the electrode cost relative to existing ultracapacitors.  In Phase I, test cells will be assembled for the purpose of evaluating electrode films and developing a relationship between electrode film performance and microstructure. The electrode performance evaluation will measure electrochemical stability, specific capacitance, and frequency response. Phase II will optimize the deposition process, develop additional post-processing steps to further enhance performance, build prototype devices, and evaluate the critical parameters:  energy density, power density, equivalent series resistance, leakage current, temperature dependence, and cycle life.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  New non-oxide ceramic electrodes should increase the power and energy densities of ultracapacitors.

This novel feed has distinct electrical and mechanical advantages not currently available.  The proposed feed is comprised of concentric coaxial waveguide radiators which have a natural geometry for multiple frequency, confocal feeding of a prime focus reflector antenna.  The coaxial waveguides maintain a circularly concentric geometry where the annular coaxial regions are employed as radiators in the specified lower frequency bands and the innermost radiator is employed as the highest frequency element.  A novel invention of the principal investigators allows polarization diversity to be applied to all frequency bands which is particularly important in satellite communication applications. This invention allows unlimited continuous polarization rotation on all frequency bands, reduced transmission line length improves signal to noise ratios and results in a compact, lightweight antenna feed.

Likewise, the identification and characterization of WMD facilities and capabilities worldwide comprise critical elements of United States endeavors to counter their proliferation.  These national security thrusts, both battlefield defense and intelligence gathering, require the detection of chemical and biological agents, as well as precursors and by-products in their production.  Also, other health related issues arising from the Persian Gulf War underscore the need to detect and identify other hazardous and toxic materials in the theater.

Standards for the transmission of NRZ data at rates in excess of 1 Gb/s already exist or are in formulation. Among these are the SONET standards (with data rates defined through 2.5 Gb/s) and Fiber Channel (with a data rate of 1.0625 Gb/s). Gigabit data rate standards also exist in Europe and Japan. A pivotal function required by fiber optic networks is the optical to electrical converter, which receives the optical signal and extracts a clock and data from it. The performance of this building block is the key in controlling the system jitter of the communications network. Because of the need for the ultimate jitter performance, not much emphasis has been placed on the development of compact or low power solutions because of the existence of bulky but effective methods of meeting bit error rate requirements. The purpose of this research is to develop a single package (0.25\" x 0.25\" x 0.1\") surface mounted receiver/synchronizer which incorporates the entire optical to electrical conversion function and dissipates less than 500 mW. If this research is successful, a substantial power and weight savings will result making possible the use of more complex local area networks in weight and power critical applications (such as airplanes and submarines) or the use of cheaper LED based LANs (as opposed to laser diodes) with shorter repeater distances.",

        "abstract": "There is currently no single cost-effective technological solution to the problem of land mine detection and location in a variety of field conditions.  Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is a useful technology in many environments, but its application in wet soil conditions is limited, especially for detection of small, anti-personnel devices.  Like most imaging methods, GPR imaging cannot provide high-confidence detection in high clutter environments.  We propose to demonstrate the feasibility of a sensor/data fusion imaging system which is useful for detection in both wet and dry conditions and which provides relatively high confidence detection in the presence of ground clutter and extraneous targets.  The system's software has been successfully demonstrated using radar data and computer simulations of seismic imaging.  We have shown that useful seismic signals can be propagated and detected at distances greater than 2 meters in a homogenous soil test bed.  Computer simulations have verified that seismic imaging can locate mines in high clutter environments.  We propose to demonstrate that the fusion of radar and seismic data in a Phase II system prototype will provide improved performance over a strictly radar-based imaging system.  Direct benefits from a successful Phase I program would be the definition of a workable mine/UXO imaging system that will allow the development and testing of a prototype in Phase II.  Ultimately we expect to develop an imaging system as a commercial product for deployment by DOD, as well as by international agencies for humanitarian de-mining.  Phase I results would also be used in the on-going TRAC-NA/Buck Research development of geophysical exploration systems, engineering systems for non-destructive testing and environmental hazards evaluation systems.",

These cryocoolerscollers share two undesirable characteristics, vibration and heat generation.  Vibration reduction has focused on multi-harmonic axial vibration cancellation using active counterbalance mechanisms; heat removal has relied upon heat sinking using heavy copper braid.  Technology Applications has defined an integrated, thermally-conductive, vibration isolation system that fits between the cryocooler and instrument housing assembly.  This system incorporates a six-axis vibration isolation system that employs compact, efficient electromagnetic actuators, force sensors, and passive dampers.  A carbon-aluminum composite flange that attaches to the cryocooler interface flange preferentially conducts heat from the cryocooler to a flexible graphite fiber thermal strap that connects to the heat rejection interface.  In Phase I, representative cryocooler thermal and vibration characteristics will be defined, preliminary designs and detailed analysis completed, and vibration isolation and heat transfer demonstration testing conducted to verify concept feasibility.  This will provide a solid basis for the Phase II research and development effort that will ultimately provide simple, reliable and inexpensive, integrated cryocooler vibration isolation and heat removal system for a wide range of commercial and aerospace applications.  Benefits:  Effective and inexpensive vibration suppression and heat rejection and essential to many cryocooler applications ranging from multi-spectral imaging to high temperature superconductors (HTS).

Breakaway wooden utility poles have been developed over the past twenty years in an effort to improve utility pole safety, but these designs have not gained widespread acceptance.  In order to realize safer utility poles which would be acceptable to both the FHWA and the utility industry, a new generation of utility pole designs which employ advanced materials and/or geometries to offer inherent improvements in both safety performance and functionality is desired.  The proposed Phase I research will investigate the feasibility of developing energy absorbing fiberglass reinforced composite (FRC) utility pole material concepts and geometries which provide for progressive crushing of the pole while bringing the vehicle to a controlled stop.  Different material constructions and structural geometries will be evaluated through finite element analyses and pendulum impact testing to select the most promising and technically feasible concepts for more detailed development and full-scale crash testing in Phase II.

While Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is considered to be one of the key sensors for monitoring compliance, radars of high enough quality to be used in this application are costly.  One of the most expensive subsystems for a high quality SAR is the Inertial Navigation System (INS) used to perform motion compensation.  This project will develop and test signal based motion compensation techniques that offer the potential for eliminating the INS.  These techniques are based on the use of advanced autofocus algorithms formulated to implement a rapid response to turbulent conditions.  In Phase I, the technique will be analyzed and compared to conventional motion compensation approaches to verify feasibility.  In Phase II, the signal based motion compensation techniques will be fully developed and tested. \n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: By reducing cost and complexity, the commercial use of SAR for applications such as radargrammetry or terrain aided navigation for autonomous landing guidance of aircraft in limited visibility becomes more feasible.

The goal is to obtain increased spectral efficiency over current military radio networks through the use of new waveform designs that exploit recent developments in coding and modulation. Consideration is given to applying commercial multiple-access radio technology and military adaptive radio network protocols. A novel waveform with a variable duty factor and recent advances in source compression algorithms are exploited to provide simultaneous delivery of data, video, and voice messages. The proposed decentralized, distributed protocols provide survivable operation of the network by responding quickly to changes in the connectivity due to movement or loss of nodes and to variations in the communication environment due to hostile jamming and other radio-frequency interference. The proposed modulation and adaptive coding techniques, along with our methods for extracting side information from the received waveform, provide efficient anti-jam communications. The side information developed in the radio receivers is used to improve link quality and to route messages around nodes that have been jammed.",

One of these all-optical processes provides for the ultrahigh speed, temporal-waveform-controlled, spatial routing of optical beams (time-to-space conversion). Propagation of an optical data stream through an entirely passive time-to-space-optical-converter device leads to the generation of spatially distinct optical signals marking the passage of specific temporal data segments. Triggering data segments are defined in device preprogramming.

To date, this has required either a high frequency synthesizer, advanced laser structures [1-3], or nonlinear optical effects [4].  The technique proposed here requires phase locking electronics that operate at no more than 5 GHz.  No component technology development is required and all components are compatible with monolithic integration.  Phase locking at an offset frequency is achieved by phase modulating the first laser and locking one of its sidebands to the second laser.  The novelty of the approach resides in sending the light through a phase modulator multiple times in order to generate higher order sidebands far removed from the carrier rather than generating the sidebands directly with a high speed phase modulator.  This is how we avoid high frequency electronics/optics. Frequencies up to 200 GHz are possible with off the shelf components; 1000 GHz is anticipated with tunable diode lasers.",

        "abstract": "The feasibility of building small ultrasound imaging arrays with integrated electronics is explored.  These arrays will ultimately be used to build laparoscopic, ultrasound imaging probes which can be used at forward military surgical locations or in emergency rooms and surgical suites.  The methods for building miniature laparoscopic probes are described and arguments presented which indicated the need for small (5 mm or less) articulation mechanisms.  To achieve this goal, the critical item required is a multilayer interconnect means which provides for mounting of the active multiplexer electronics, connection to 128 individual array elements, and connection to the imaging system console via a reduced number of signal channels.  Methods for making the required interconnect structure will be evaluated and the most promising design will be fabricated and demonstrated.  The outcome of this research benefits the military by making it possible to build light-weight, articulated intraoperative and emergency surgery probes to be used in forward surgical facilities or in field hospitals.  Ultrasound imaging in these locations will guide emergency care by identification of bleeding and internal damage while simultaneously reducing surgical exploration.  Ultimately, this type of care for wounded soldiers will increase survival rate and decrease recovery time.  Anticipated Military Benefits/Potential Commercial Applications of the Research or Development:  The military gains a new tool which can be used at forward surgery locations or field hospitals to perform quick exploration of wound sites and internal bleeding.  Private sector surgeons will gain a small, flexible means to guide minimally invasive surgery and therapy.",

Capitalizing on the latest developments in discourse analysis and natural language processing, as well as utilizing the TextWise DR-LINK text retrieval system, this proposal will develop a chronological information extraction system (CHESS), capable of exploiting the rich trail of archived information that exists in many data bases. CHESS will take advantage of the common practice among writers of including information-rich linguistic constructions in close proximity to related proper names.  By recognizing the proper names in a text, then locating and recording the associated linguistic construction, it is possible to construct complex, in-depth historiographies of events and their specific relation to a given proper name that can span several decades.  This proposal will develop an extraction system for three types of linguistic construction -- appositional, relative clause, and copula sentence -- and will develop a system for mapping proper names and associated linguistic constructions to conceptual categories to produce concept-relation-concept triples.  The result will be a system ideally suited for trend analysis, historical issues, domain-dependent scenario analysis, and biography.",

All retrieval technology to date has assumed that the information being sought will be found in documents in the same language as the user's query. TextWise Inc's proposed CINDOR system offers the opporutnity to extend technology developed under the auspices of ARPA funding to a heretofore unattained multilingual capability, whereby the speaker of one language an achieve a text search with high precision and recall in any of several languages, simultaneously, even if they do not speak the target languages. This extension is accomplished via two machine readable lexical knowledge bases. The first one, a monolingual hierarchical concept dictionary, is used to assign concept group codes to foreign language words. The second one, a multilingual translation database, converts a concept group code into an English semantic code. The semantic codes are used to produce semantic vectors which allow texts of the supported languages to be retrieved, routed, classified, and clustered as if they were English documents. Anticipated Benefits: Formidable industrial, military, government, and economic benefits from improved technical and scientific communication would be realized by this breakthrough from monolingual to multilingual text searching. In addition, the feasibility shown by Phase I will allow us to demonstrate multilingual text retrieval technology to potential Phase II commercial entities who can provide part of the support and investment needed to move toward the commercialization of CINDOR.",

With a maximum weight of only 12 kg, and a wingspan of 3 m, it has about 1500 km range and 24 hours endurance.  This early version leaves much room for improvement, and we expect to double range and endurance by mid-1997.  Still another doubling ultimately should be feasible, to more than 7000 km range, along with a ceiling of about 16 km.  Aerosondes have already made meterological-quality thermodynamic and wind measurements, and have the potential to do so on a wide-scale with total costs in the tens of dollars per flight-hour.\n\nThis project concentrates on improving communications range, which is vital to realizing the aircraft's promise.  At present, a supervisory station must have line-of-sight with the aircraft, and in practice this limits operating radius to about 100 km.  To go further, we need over-the-horizon communications, which means preferably, though not necessarily, a satellite relay.  In Phase I, we propose to study the options, select one, and design a new avionics set for use in 1997.

An unusual combination of properties causes nearly invariant transmission and large adjustable group delay for low-power, electromagnetic pulses.  This is an extremely valuable and previously unavailable capability.  For a picosecond pulse propagating near the photonic band edge of a 8 micron, one-dimensional CaAs/A1As layered structure the total group is well in excess of 100 microns.  In addition, the total group delay accumulates linearly with the number of similar structures.  With no detectable distortion of pulse shape.  The group index for the optical pulse exhibits a dramatic increase, it is tunable, and many orders of magnitude more sensitive to variation in material refractive index than for bulk material.  The combination of high transmission and large group index are long-sought phenomenon.  Incorporation of these effects in a simple integrated circuit will make it possible to create extremely short, precise, and stable time delays.  The delays produced by such a device would be on the order of 10s of picosecounds with a stability on the order of a few picosecounds.",

        "abstract": "A new modified-isogrid construction method, referred to as Grd-Lock, has been previously developed which affords the ability to construct relatively lightweight yet robust and reliable bonded or brazed metallic structures.  Isogrid structures rely prmarly on a single skin with integral vertical ribs to furnish the necessary stiffness and strength.  Grid-Lock affords the opportunity to acheive superior strength and stiffness at a greatly reduced weight by tying together all of the vertical ribs of an isogrid by means of two attached surface skins.  To further ensure intimate contact and excellent load transfer with all internal rib stiffeners, grooves are molded or machined into the surface skins.  These grooves provide an efficient shear joint and mechanical interlocking effect.  The goal of this study is to develop an efficient all-composite, bonded, Grid-Lock structure.  In addition, an assessment of the potential of this construction method to the production of lightweight reliable and cost effective composite aircraft structures will be performed.  This will be accomplished through analyical studies aimed at identifying the optimum design configuration for selected part geometries and applied load states.  A limited mechanical test effort will be conducted to corroborate analytical predictions.",

        "abstract": "The development of a \"smart,\" anti-jam, single-element GPS antenna is proposed.  The approach uses an electronically reconfigurable antenna (ERA) whose gain pattern has an azimuthal null which can be varied by adjusting control loads on the antenna.  The loads are adjusted and controlled by an adaptive feedback network which uses receiver output to change the control elements and, thus, alter the antenna properties in an optimal manner (smart antenna).  This will increase the signal to jammer ratio (SJR) at the antenna input.  The antenna element will be a surface conformable microstrip spiral that is four or five inches in diameter and has variable control loads on each of the spiral arms.  An analysis of such an antenna is shown for the L1 GPS frequency.  It demonstrates that a narrow null in the antenna pattern can be steered in any azimuthal direction by varying the load impedances.  The null is more than 40 dBi deep and is only a few degrees wide in a pattern that is otherwise isotropic with a gain of a few dBi.  The feedback control network would maintain the jammer in this deep null.",

Coating systems that perform more than one function reduce design complexity and cost of fabrication.   TPL proposes innovative, multi-component sol-gel processing to produce optical coatings with the complex chemistry necessary to achieve multi-functional capabilities.  Sol-gel is the only viable approach to achieve multi-functional coatings because of its high compositional control.  The multi-functional coatings can be applied to virtually any substrate and at a reasonable cost.  The Phase I will show the feasibility of making multi-functional coating systems by chemically designing sol-gel derived glasses.  Several compositional combinations (e.g., silica, alumina, titania) will be used to produce optical films with the desired properties.  The filters will be made by alternating layers of different optical thicknesses (refractive index multiplied by thickness) and/or by tailored transition metal additions.  Optical spectrophotometry and mechanical tests will show the performance of these filters.    TPL has the extensive experience and resources in sol-gel technology.

Existing cleanup processes have difficulties in achieving low metal contamination levels, especially in the presence of competing nontoxic ions, high ionic strengths, and particulate matter; costs of cleanup can be prohibitively high.  An effective and economical process to remove heavy metal ions prior to discharge is required.  This project will examine two series of high-efficiency covalently modified silica materials, with metal ion capacities greatly exceeding those of commercial ion exchange resins.  One series has high capacity for \u00c2\u00bfsoft\u00c2\u00bf heavy metal ions such as mercury, lead, silver, and cadmium; the other has high capacity for anionic metal ions such as pertechnetate, arsenate, selenite, and chromate.  Phase I will synthesize the materials and each will be evaluated for metal binding capacity, selectivity relative to nontoxic competing ions, efficiency in high ionic strength wastewaters, ease of regeneration for reuse of material and reclamation of metal, and cost and ease of production.  The results will provide a foundation for Phase II, in which large-scale testing will be performed in actual industrial situations. \n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The metal-binding silica materials should be effective in binding a broad range of toxic heavy metal ions, including mercury, lead, cadmium, silver, technetium, selenium, arsenic, and hexavalent chromium, from industrial wastewaters.

Validation of these capabilities proves challenging with traditional ground-based and GPS-based reference systems.  Available carrier-phase DGPS systems have great potential as reference systems, but their response to signal blockage and high dynamics is poor.  Simple cascaded IMU formulations are inadequate under these very rigorous reception regimes, and therefore fundamental improvements in phase tracking robustness are needed. A new algorithm is proposed consisting of two stages: a) an integrated demodulation/navigation phase tracker, and b) a dual-frequency ambiguity resolution scheme optimized for P/Y service.  The first stage employs optimal filtering of raw IQ correlator outputs at 1OOHz, using navigation domain covariances, IMU aiding, and carrier phase DGPS corrections.  The Tracking and Imaging Systems signal simulator will be used to explore candidate algorithms in the high dynamics environment. Phase I activities include feasibility studies of aided and dual antenna versions of the carrier phase algorithms, and definition of modular interfaces between the carrier phase processor's CPU and the host GPS receiver's CPU.  Efforts lead to early Phase II demonstration of the algorithms on NRaD's GPS simulator.",

        "abstract": "Toward understanding and curing mental disorders and cancer, a greatly improved system for transfection of neuronal and tumor cells (e. g. astrocytes) by electroporation will be developed. A preliminary prototype has been constructed. Experiments with E. coli show that cells and DNA can be drawn up into a novel pipetting electrode assembly, transfected, and ejected in less than five seconds. This is an order of magnitude time savings compared with currently available commercial devices. Because of decreased exposure time to non-culture conditions and handling, this system offers the potential for increased transformation efficiencies, especially for fragile neuronal and tumor cells. Electroporation units on the market today are bulky, expensive, benchtop devices. By redesigning the power supply with an eye on miniaturization, a compact handheld prototype has been developed. Furthermore, this new design will cost substantially less than currently available equipment, bringing high efficiency electrotransforma- tion to even small laboratories that now resort to less effective, more time consuming, chemically induced transformations. During Phase I, biological testing with various waveforms and cell preparation protocols will be used to better understand the basic mechanism of electroporation and optimize the above designs. The results will be applied to Phase Il neuronal and tumor cell transformations.",

Triton Systems proposes an innovative, economical, flexible single-step rapid joining process called Directed Laser Welding (DLW) that can produce reliable high strength joints and enable quick assembly MMC ground and space-based BMDO structures. The Phase I effort is directed towards defining the optimum processing parameters necessary for direct laser joining graphite fiber reinforced aluminum test panels with greater than 50 percent joint efficiency.

The chip will use and array of analog, non-linear neural motion detectors to process exceptionally fast, moving edges in real-time.  The theory of operation is based on a biological analogy with primitive motion neurons and results in theoretical frame rates that exceed 200 MHz using analog silicon technology.  Primitive motion detectors use a second-order, neural net, activation function where its dynamical behavior of this activation function is characterized by the spatial-temporal difference equation O(i,t)= Al(i,t)+BI(i,t)Oi-\"delta\" i,t-\"delta\" t -- A and B are constants and I is the input.  This system exhibits the same dynamics as do biological motion sensing retinal cells known as Riechardt detector neurons.  Such neural structures (Riechardt detectors) are common in insect, and other animal, visual processing layers near the photodetection cells (i.e. at the retina).  This phase I will leverage a one-dimensional analog hardware implementation of these motion neurons (previously developed by US&R s Principle Investigator), and implement a two-dimensional system.  An IC cell layout for an analog VLSI chip will be generated as a final result of this phase I with the intent of fabricating the IC design.  These issues include:  cell architecture (how many neighbor cells?), readout modes (e.g. the possible use of optical readout for ultra high operating speeds), and methods for controlling  \"delta\" x and \"delta\" t to detect a spectrum of velocities, e.g. a characteristic detection velocity for the above difference equation is given by v=\"delta\"I/\"delta\"t.  Nonlinear dependence on   \"delta\"I and/or \"delta\"t is entirely possible by generalizing the model.",

Still, they are powerful enough to retrofit Object Oriented (OO) features onto non-OO languages - e.g. assembler - and they are orders of magnitude easier to create than textual wizard. or template code due to their visual nature. The main goal of Phase I is to demonstrate that this novel agent technology can do more than build and patch code.

Software technology is used in a large number of critical systems and the importance of having maintainable high-quality software is increasing.

        "abstract": "Fragmenting warheads offer a high kill radius and lethality against lightly armored targets such as aircraft, personnel carriers, entrenched personnel, missiles, and spacecraft.  One of the easiest ways to increase the penetration capability of a kinetic energy penetrator, shaped charge liner, fragmenting warhead, or explosively formed penetrator is by increasing the density of the material from which it is fabricated.  Tungsten and tungsten carbide are two of the most attractive warhead materials, being low in cost and having densities comparable to depleted uranium and tantalum, but pose formidable design and fabrication challenges because of their limited ductility below \u00c2\u00bf1000\u00c2\u00bfC.  Unfortunately, current tungsten fragmenting warhead designs have poor material yield (material actually formed into the penetrator rod or ball).  One method to improve performance (yield) is through the development of tungsten composites, which combine the good forming capabilities (tensile ductility) of materials such as iron, tantalum, or copper with the high density of tungsten to yield an optimal warhead.  In this Phase I program, Ultramet proposes to investigate the effects of matrix composition, distribution, properties, and composite microstructure on tungsten composites for EFP and fragmenting warhead application through fabrication and testing of coupons and warheads from a series of tungsten composite compositions and microstructures.  Fabrication techniques will be demonstrated leading to microstructural and compositional control of tungsten and tungsten carbide composites using two matrices; elevated strain rate testing will be conducted on selected compositions and microstructures; and spall testing will be conducted to relate composition, processing, microstructure, and properties to warhead design.",

Such devices based on inorganic semiconductors with bandgaps larger than 3.25 eV are at an early stage of development. Organic semiconductors, by contrast,, offer advantages for use as emitters and detectors in the green, blue, and UV. Organic semiconducting polymers are intrinsically large bandgap materials. They are readily and inexpensively processed, either from solution in an appropriate solvent or from a melt. Preliminary results for photodiodes based on such polymers show a number of intriguing features: a sharp cutoff in responsibility at the semiconductor band edge, the possibility of tailoring this spectral cutoff by altering chemical structure, good UV sensitivity, and a relatively flat spectral response. Little is known about the noise characteristics or other potential limitations of these devices. UNIAX proposes a Phase I research program with the goal of establishing the viability of polymer photodiodes for solar blind UV detector applications. The proposed research will focus both on identifying appropriate materials, and on an investigation of the detector characteristics of devices based on them. Appropriate candidate materials have already been developed for the company's blue light emitting device program.",

This project will explore a simple technique for fabricating CIS films for solar cells.  The film deposition process will combine material techniques developed for other applications:  high-temperature superconductors, the commercial paint industry, and high-performance flat panel displays.  Phase I will demonstrate that low-cost precursor materials can be prepared and that device-quality CIS films can be fabricated.  Phase II will demonstrate state-of-the-art cell efficiencies and demonstrate the commercial potential of the technology.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The process to be developed should halve the cost of a CIS film for a thin-film solar-module.  The availability of such a process should significantly accelerate the commercialization of CIS PV technology for a wide range of applications.",

The primary application is an outboard motor with a nominal rating of 55 hp.  This engine also has applications for ultralight aircraft, marine and other platforms throughout the military.  There are no commercially available products, foreign or domestic, that meet this specification.  VAIREX proposes to use their proprietary Variable Positive Displacement Supercharger (VPDS) to increase the power density of a small (20-25 hp) industrial Diesel by raising the engine's inlet pressure ratio from 3.5 to 4.0, in addition to increasing the operating speed to 4200 rpm. Power densities over 0.40 hp/lb should be achievable at a 1,000 hour design life.  This VPDSupercharged Diesel engine will be integrated into a domestically manufactured outboard \"lower end\" in Phase II.  The Phase I SBIR tasks include Product Definition, Engine Selection, and a Supercharger Evaluation Test. Commercial products based on technological spin-offs from this program include Diesel APUs for Hybrid Electric Vehicles, air management systems for vehicular fuel cell power systems and small displacement superchargers for the automotive industry.",

        "abstract": "Neural networks as well as classical transformation techniques have been successful in the field of static pattern recognition. However, the problem of reliably detecting and recognizing weak, temporally varying signals remains a challenge.  New techniques are needed to detect and recognize conventional signal types within a dense, dynamically, changing, interference environment.  Given their successful application to the field of static pattern recognition, neural networks offer a promising approach to solving this difficult problem.  The approach for detecting and recognizing weak, temporal Signals of Interest (SOIs) and Signals Not of Interest (NSOIs) consists of three distinct parts:  algorithm development, simulation environment development, and algorithm validation.  These three parts are designed to achieve the stated objectives by providing careful analyses of existing neural network architectures as well as the development of hybrid architectures and by thoroughly validating these algorithms in a controlled, reproducible, simulated environment.  This research is expected to produce a set of algorithms which can be applied to separating SOIs and SNOIs, as well as a set of heuristics for selecting which algorithms to apply given characteristics of the type of signal being analyzed.  This project deals with the three major parts of research which address algorithm development, signal simulation environment, and algorithm validation.",

The initial   effort will be to interface nonlinear structural analysis software   such as ABAQUS or SYNA-3D.  However, the general capability proposed   here is not limited to these, and may be applied to virtually any   analysis, including CFD, controls, cost models, etc.  Furthermore,   such a capability will provide the basic building block for general   multidiscipline design optimization (MDO), making best use of   available capabilities in each discipline of interest.  The second objective is to create a general design study program   which effectively utilizes the information available from the   optimization process.  This includes the interactive trade-off   studies, post-processing to display design sensitivities,   robustness analysis of the optimum, creation of response surface   information for simplified trade-off studies, and similar uses of   the design space information available from the optimization   process.  The key motivation of this second objective is to provide   visual information to help the engineer or manager better   understand and present the reasons the optimizer did what it did   and to efficiently ask \"What if\" questions.  The goal is to create and market premier commercial software which   allows the engineer to easily use optimization for a wide variety   of individual and multidiscipline design tasks, and to clearly and   concisely display optimization information.",

        "abstract": "This proposal addresses the problem of identifying and testing clutter suppression techniques and implementing algorithms for detection of targets imbedded in cluttered terrain backgrounds.  Tactical remote sensing systems such as Warfighter must carry out their target detection and identification mission against a wide variety of earth background scenes having an as yet undetermined range of clutter properties.  Hence, such sensors must be capable of utilizing the spectral, temporal, and spatial dimensions of the target signature while rejecting or mitigating the background clutter.  In order to optimize the sensor performance against widely ranging, sometimes poorly defined engagement scenarios, it is necessary to account for the effects of sensor system optical and electronic performance on implementation of clutter suppression and target signal optimization techniques.  The process of implementing and optimizing clutter suppression algorithms for proposed tactical testbeds such as MightySat and Warfighter must also address practical systems considerations such as sensor and signal processing complexity, cost, and on-orbit weight and power utilization required for combined sensor and target detection signal processing system.  The proposed research will identify and test one or more innovative clutter suppression algorithms in the context of the Warfighter sensor scenario.  Benefits:  The anticipated commercial applications of this research are background scene content recognition and discrimination models and algorithms based upon the clutter rejection algorithms which are the subject of this SBIR research.|",

The overall objective of this project is to implement an extensible, automated tool for penetration analysis of trusted software written in C, and to perform experiments with the tool on selected trusted systems to establish the usefulness of tool-based penetration analysis.  The tool will enable the identification of flaws in trusted code that could lead to system penetration, and will generate sufficient information to help produce real penetration scenarios and countermeasures.  The penetration analysis tool, when fully implemented, will provide a significant measure of confidence in the integrity and security of computer system and network software.  It is envisioned that the method and tool developed in this project will be used for analyzing the source code of distributed systems platforms, network protocols, and high-assurance systems under B2-A1, or equivalent,  evaluations.

Each projectile contains a substantial payload, a rocket motor to accelerate the projectile to high peak velocity during flight, and guidance commensurate with system requirements to achieve high hit probability.   The muzzle velocity of the gun is augmented by the rocket booster to achieve flight characteristics suitable for a variety of range and target acquisition requirements; thus, the concept has unusual versatility inasmuch as the projectile features modularity and can be specially tailored to suit a specific mission.  The rocket-boosted weapon concept has undergone initial conceptualization; but, the studies and analyses that are needed to establish the technical feasibility of some of the higher risk features, aircraft integration, and identification and adaptation to a specific mission have not been performed.

Phase I breadboard validation of this unique biosampler concept will form basis for Phase II advanced development.

Because these are all based on a silicon MOSFET structure they have poor high temperature performance, radiation degradation, high input capacitance, and reverse recovery losses due to their internal body diode.  Under worst case, end-of-life conditions, their performance is a little better than Schottky diodes.  A new GaAs synchronous rectifier has inherent radiation and temperature advantages over MOS devices.  Also because it has a JFET structure, there is no internal body diode with its associated losses.  VPT proposes to incorporate GaAs synchronous rectifiers into a radiation tolerant, active clamp, PWM soft-switching converter.  It is shown to have significant advantages over a conventional current-fed push pull (CFPP) converter, widely used in spacecraft applications because of its radiation tolerance.  The soft-switching circuit, coupled with GaAs devices, is capable of high efficiency at high frequency operation and is ideally suited in space applications.Benefits:  The technology is of direct interest to both government and commercial satellites.",

This limitation, while not completely solved, is changing.  A new generation of devices, known as Field Programmable Analog Arrays (FPAAs) and mixed-signal arrays (FPMAs) have recently been introduced.  The overall objective of this effort is to augment the Navy's ongoing Rapid Retargeting effort, which to date has focused on digital function, with a broader program to address all electronic components regardless of technology.  The objective of Phase I is to prove feasibility by simulating a series of SEM Format A Key Codes with a single FPAA or FPMA simulation. This effort will have an impact in two areas.  First, a solution to the critical obsolescence problem currently facing the Navy will be introduced.  Second, the number of spares currently required for operational units could be greatly reduced through execution of an operational PAMs program.  The results of the Phase I PAMs program will provide an expansion of the Rapid Retargeting effort already active in the Navy.",

        "abstract": "This Phase I proposal, submitted under the SBIR component of the ARPA TRP proposes the development of a family of affordable, high precision, self-calibrating, environmentally robust, Fiber Optic Position Transducers.  Visidyne's ultra high resolution optical radar technology provides the basis for a transducer that can operate in harsh environments, including temperatures greater than 400 degrees Celsius, poor EMI conditions and severe vibrations.  A key advantage of the design is that the sensor head is completely passive.  An ultra high resolution optical radar probes the sensor head via optical fibers and measures displacements there with extremely high accuracy.  Despite the high level of performance, the design is highly pragmatic and can be implemented by making use of existing technolgy bases including laser diodes developed for entertainment electronics, and chipsets used in cellular telephones and GPS receivers.  Anticipated Military Benefits/Potential Commercial Applications of the Research or Development:  To take full advantage of fly-by-light technology, the next generation of military aircraft will require reliable, rugged, high precision absolute positional transducers capable of operating at high temperatures.  The commercial potential for such a  sensor is large, with potential markets in commercial aviation and chemical processing industries.  Visidyne intends to team with a manufacturer of actuators to exploit this market.",

Because of the tailor-made nature of these components, costs are often high, maintainability is difficult, and their use with other satellites is not feasible.  The proposed investigation includes the development of a satellite front end that embodies the MAGIC objectives and architecture, and utilizes PC hardware and COTS components.  This effort includes:  1) Design and prototype development of a satellite front end that uses IBM-PC hardware running Windows-NT, and COTS PCI telemetry data processing hardware; 2) The study of two front end hardware/software architectures.  The first to frame format and time stamp only input data, and the second to perform real-time satellite-specific telemetry decommutation directly in the front end; 3) The functional design of the required hardware for the front end. 4) The design and development of a prototype front end Master Control Program (MCP) that runs under Windows-NT, and development of the required hardware drivers to support the prototype demonstration; 5) A prototype demonstration to illustrate operation of the front end MCP, determine hardware and network bandwidth, and demonstrate remote operation with a MAGIC analysis workstation.|Benefits:  The potential DOD benefits include reduced cost, accelerated product, robust software and hardware, and reduced operator training.  The commercial satellite industry (projected to be a $31B industry in hardware and a $131B market in services would find wide applications for a universal ground station front end that can service telemetry data from a large number of satellites.|",

AWJs have been demonstrated for the precision drilling of small-diameter holes (0.5-2.5 mm [0.02-1.0 inch]) in metals, glass, composites, and coated materials.  Our understanding of the mechanics of the drilling process is very limited, yet it is critical for future product implementation. Prediction and control of hole size and shape (straight, convergent, and divergent) requires a better understanding of the drilling process; the proposed effort aims at developing this knowledge.  The approach followed includes parametric drilling test to study the effect of jet structure parameters on hole drilling results such as drilling time and hole shape.  Studies using high- speed movies will be conducted to understand the kinematics of the penetration process.  Dynamic manipulation of the jet structure-by real-time control of pressure and abrasive flow rate-will be studied.  This method has been found essential for controlling both quantitative and qualitative hole drilling results in coated and fragile materials.  A physical model will be formulated to include critical drilling process parameters.  Phase II research efforts will include advanced modeling studies, optimization of the process, and drilling system control requirements.  An AWJ-based drilling system will be produced and marketed in Phase III.",

Currently, triploid Pacific oysters are induced primarily by inhibiting the second polar body with  cytochalasin B.  There are major limitations to the use of CB, but these limitations would be eliminated if triploid oysters could be produced by crossing diploids and tetraploids.  After more than a decade of attempts to produce tetraploid oysters, success was finally achieved in 1993.  This novel technique, in retrospect, is quite simple and success depends on a number of variables, almost none of them explored in any systematic way.  For commercial production of triploids using tetraploids as brood stock, the rate limiting process is obtaining the tetraploids in the first place, but we do not know whether the tetraploid induction technique, developed in the lab, is transferable to a commercial hatchery.

The economical fabrication of ULSI circuits depends on in-situ non-destructive inspection tools with increasingly stringent spatial resolution and sensitivity requirements. This project will investigate using tapered x-ray capillary optics to decrease the area sampled during XPS by an order of magnitude without a decrease in sensitivity. X-Ray Optical Systems, Inc. proposes to combine tapered glass optics techniques developed for higher energy x-ray energies with a recently demonstrated ability to achieve high transmission efficiency with the appropriate energy range (1-1.5 keV) for XPS. The researchers and collaborators are leading figures in the development of capillary x-ray optics and cluster tool technology.

        "abstract": "Polycapillary x-ray monolithic optics have the potential to be one of the best methods for controlling x-ray beams across a broad energy spectrum because of their efficiency, size, and applicability to a variety of technologies.  Widespread use of polycapillary optics is currently impeded because after the design stage, the first working prototype may take a month or more of manufacturing effort.  Consequently, both the need and the opportunity exists to develop a comprehensive approach to lens production by computer aided design/computer aided manufacture (CAD/CAM).  In this Phase I proposal, we will demonstrate the feasibility of controlling the polycapillary lens manufacturing process from design to product by testing and evaluating the critical parameters and developing an approach for real-time computer process control.  The work is expected to lead to a process that will condense the production cycle time to one hour.  Our expert team of scientists, progrannners and engineers have the key skill set to develop this innovation in automated manufacture of polycapillary optics.  Furthermore, as the design-to-product time decreases, the responsiveness and cost effectiveness for single optic and batch production runs for research, medical, military, and industrial applications would dramatically improve.  The radically shortened production schedule for advanced technology, polycapillary x-ray optics will directly effect US competitiveness through the sale of optics, and more importantly, the sale of competitively superior x-ray based instruments.",

Traditionally, observations such as cloud cover are made by human observers, and thus often suffer from uncertainties due to the subjectivity of the observer.  Cloud cover data is especially important in UV-B hazard prediction, as well as storm prediction.  It is generally accepted that UV-B doses should be predicted, rather than just reported, in order to minimize public health impact.  These UV-B forecast models rely heavily on consistent and accurate cloud cover data.\n\nWe propose to investigate several novel ideas for inexpensive, autonomous, electro-optic sensors that can determine cloud cover conditions automatically.

        "abstract": "A micromachined aerosol collection system for biological warfare (BW) agents will be designed, fabricated, and tested.  This device can be coupled with a detection technology for use on the traditional battlefield and in counter-terrorism applications.  The aerosol collection system we propose to build uses a combination of microelectromechanical and microfluidic technologies capable of trapping airborne viruses, bacteria, molds, and spores and eliminating smokes, dust, and other large particulate interferences.  We will utilize advances in precision engineering techniques to develop a system with miniaturized components.  The system will consist of three principle elements: (1) microcydones, (2) micro-machined electrostatic precipitators or virtual impactors, (3) micro-channeled liquid collection.  This flexible system can be assembled into smaller or larger architectures for a range of  applications.  It will overcome several limitations of the current biological detector (BIDS) system: (1) micromachined sheet substrate material choice is not limited; silicon, teflon, plastics, ceramics, and metals can be micromachined to be lightweight and compact; (2) laminar flow in micromachined virtual impactors reduces the destruction of biological samples by impaction and increases collection efficiency; (3) the particle size range that can be effectively collected will be improved by an order of magnitude over current devices while power consumption is reduced; and (4) compact micro-architecture reduces size and is ideal for mobile or battlefield applications.  Through the innovative use of micro-machined components, our aerosol collection system is extremely flexible and can be developed for personal, vehicular, airborne, or other uses, greatly expanding its range of possible applications.  The commercial uses include collection of airborne infectious agents in hospitals and research labs, monitoring confined spaces such as submarines and subways for dangerous airborne biological material; identification of possible \"sick building\" problems; counter-terrorism monitoring of pathogenic material.",

This high-level noise is a contributory factor in operator fatigue and discomfort.

Because the system does not require crosslinks, initial satellites can be deployed directly into the constellation structure and the overall system has very soft failure modes.

Phase II will create a high accuracy system simulation, definition of system component requirements, an assessment of on-orbit calibration requirements, and a test and flight verification plan.|  Benefits:  With growing interest in both surveillance and LEO communications constellations, the problem of robust, low-cost constellation maintenance is critical.

To execute the program, SPEC is joined by Pico Systems.  SPEC possesses data recorder design expertise supported by strong microelectronic integration and test experience.  Pico offers a shock hardened MCM technology with lower non-recuring engineering (NRE) costs compared to other MCM technologies of the same circuit densities.  Together, SPEC and Pico offer the government a synergistic approach to problem solution.  SPEC, assisted by PICO, will investigate additional implementations for the shock hardened data recorder beyond the single layer, single substrate baseline.  The first variant is a single substrate double layer (piggy backed) recorder.  This approach features DRAMs and EPROMs which are piggy backed so that component density doubles at modest increase in cost.  The second variant features a vertical stack of the baseline substrate.  A third variant depicts a vertical stack of the substrate with double memory layer (piggy backed).",

Devices like vacuum field emission transistors (VFETs) have the advantages of vacuum tubes, can be size compatible to silicon microelectronic technology, and utilize field-electron emission.  Present field emission cathodes suffer from many problems including lack of emission uniformity and reproducibility.  The relatively high work function of the emissive material, capacitance of the device, and space charge effects also adversely effect device performance.  Further development of field emission cathodes is the key technology for improved performance of VFETs and other such devices.Systems & Processes Engineering Corporation (SPEC) proposes to develop a VFET using a novel diamond microtip array cathode for improved performance.  This cathode has the advantages of metal microtip field emission arrays while eliminating many of the problems associated with metal tips.

        "abstract": "We propose to design and develop a system of manufacturing integrated circuits in small and medium volume using shared masks. Current gate array manufacture dedicates high cost masks to each chip design. For high volumes, this cost is acceptable because it is amortized over a large number of chips. For typical small DoD volumes, the tooling costs make the chips' unit cost 10 to 100 times the high volume unit cost. Our method shares common mask and fabrication costs among 10 to 100 different designs, thus dramatically reducing the cost of each design. Shared mask technology has been successfully used for years by the ARPA-funded MOSIS service, but shared mask technology has never been applied to produce low cost gate arrays in low volumes. Our Phase I effort will include the design, fabrication and testing of sample gate arrays, and the investigation of two advanced concepts. The first idea leads to increased flexibility of the size of gate arrays and therefore reduces the startup costs of the shared-mask gate array manufacturing process. The second idea targets the lowering of costs for medium volume fabrication runs. Phase II will include a full-scale multi-project gate array fabrication run and transition to a Phase III commercial service providing the Navy and commercial customers with low-volume gate arrays at less than 1/10th their current cost. This effort is a follow on to an ONR-funded Phase I and will be geared toward transferring the technology to Navy fabrication facilities.",

This technology has been developed by IDI over the past three years in conjuction with NASA Lewis and BFGoodrich DeIcing Systems for use with pneumatic boots. The environmentally rugged sensors are aerodynamically non-intrusive and can be installed with minimal structural modifications to the airframe. IDI will extend this capacitive technology for use with all ice protection systems on the Osprey with a focus on the electro-thermal proprotor de-icing system. IDI will integrate capacitive ice detection sensors with the existing prop heaters to create a smart de-icing system. The sensors will be able to monitor ice accretions in real time and activate the prop heaters at a predetermined ice thickness. This will maintain the size of the shed ice particles at an acceptable level to prevent fuselage damage for even the most severe icing conditions. Because the shed particle size can be controlled additional protective material is not needed on the fuselage resulting in added weight savings. Successful completion will drive a Phase II program to develop an integrated ice detection system for all ice prone surfaces on the V-22.",
