The device implements a new attenuation feature that improves attenuation by 10 dB(A) over traditional devices. Active noise control will be added to the system during the Phase II effort. When used in combination with a helmet, over 50 dB(A) of noise attenuation will be achieved. The attenuation of the system will be limited only by bone conducted noise.   RTH Corporation will deliver to the Navy 5 prototype systems that have been fully tested on an acoustic test fixture as well as on humans. The use of the RTH hearing protection device will provide noise attenuation superior to any currently available personal hearing protection device. This technology is directly applicable to the civilian aircraft environment as well as manufacturing plants, construction sites ... The improved attenuation results in superior protection from hearing trauma and improved speech intelligibility.",

        "abstract": "As we progress towards the network-centric environment envisioned by JV2010 and JV2020, our dependency upon space assets to meet our force enhancement (C4, weather, navigation, intelligence, surveillance, etc.) requirements is expected to growexponentially.  This trend is not only for our forces, but the forces of our potential adversaries, as well. With so many mission critical assets parked in various orbit types above the battlefield, it is important for the commander and his staff to beoperationally aware of activities in this fourth medium, space.  The commander's battlespace awareness must now extend many miles above the earth's surface into this arena.Indeed, the task of space control is rapidly becoming a necessity.  The success of terrestrial forces requires a comprehensive space situational awareness (SSA) and, very soon, will necessitate a space control capability. 21st Century Systems, Inc. isessentially proposing an SSA/decision support application that provides a single integrated space picture capable of being used in the space control arena. It will employ intelligent agent technology to generate a three dimensional view of objects on orbitabove the battlefield. This project will also use XML objects as the medium of information distribution and storage.This SBIR will culminate in an integrated SituSpace software package that will assist the commander and his staff in visualizing the upper battlespace arena and the disposition of friendly and unfriendly on-orbit forces.  This application, paired with anASAT capability, would assist in the future space control activity. This will be a unique product.  Many commercial applications, which require their own aggregated picture of objects on orbit, would benefit strongly from the SituSpace concept: commercialsatellite launch companies, NASA, air traffic control, and others.  The SituSpace product will be delivered through 21CSI's open architecture AEDGE(TM) environment.Beyond the SituSpace core product, transition of the decision support system (DSS) technology itself also will have very significant potential.  DSS agents have wide potential applicability to just about every industry involving humans in the loop(including the consumer sector).  Our first commercial, non-military product incorporating SituSpace technology will thus likely be an agent-based decision aid for operations in commercial space management, intransit visibility in transportation orintelligent flexible manufacturing. The commercial SituSpace variant tool will plug into the existing online resources, including space object and transportation networks, relevant databases, and others.  The tool will be used both for support ofdecision-making and for distributed training.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this Phase-II proposal is to develop Alameda Applied Sciences Corporation's (AASC) Coaxial Energetic Deposition (CED) process to increase the life of gun barrels by depositing a protective refractory metal coating to the inside of thebarrel that can outperform and replace the electroplated chrome coatings that are presently used. This effort extends and builds upon AASC's promising Phase-I results where Ta:W(10%), pure tungsten and Stellite (a cobalt/chrome/tungsten alloy) weredeposited using the CED process. As part of this Phase-II, refractory coatings will be deposited to the inside of 45 mm and 76 mm tests sections using the CED process and live-fire tests will be performed and benchmarked against chrome. The coatings willbe tested for their internal stress, chemical composition, microstructure, hardness and heat-affected zones both before and after the test firings and will be optimized to reduce the chemical, physical and thermal effects to the coating and the underlyingsteel. A full-scale deposition system will be designed and a prototype system will be built to transition the CED process into Phase-III production. To speed commercialization, AASC intends to license the CED technology to a large gun manufacturer. It isanticipated that these coatings will extend the life and increase the capabilities of large-caliber, ship born, naval gun barrels. There are four direct benefits of this Phase-II program. 1) Since the coatings will extend the life of the gun barrels, shipscan stay on mission longer, reducing life-cycle and sustainment costs. 2) The coatings will allow existing guns to be upgraded to use higher energy propellants with a relatively un-intrusive and inexpensive modification to the existing fabrication process.3) The coatings will allow future, high-performance gun system to be built that can not be constructed using today's technology. 4) The CED process eliminates the use of electroplated chrome, which is hazardous and is being phased-out. In addition, CEDcoatings have already demonstrated that they extend the life of ethylene cracking tubes used by the petroleum industry for olefin manufacturing. CED coatings have the potential to extend the life of tubes or cylinders where mechanical wear, causticchemicals or elevated temperatures are contributing factors to the failure of the system, leading to cost savings in operation and maintenance. Examples of such systems are engine and hydraulic cylinders, exhaust components and turbine blades.",

        "abstract": "70042S02-II     The quantification of sources and sinks of atmospheric carbon dioxide would be greatly facilitated by the development of a new detector for this important greenhouse gas.  In particular a lightweight CO2 sonde, similar to the widely used ozonesonde, could be used to estimate landscape-scale (approximately 100 km2) fluxes of CO2 from vertical profiles through the convective boundary layer.  This project will develop a new CO2 detector based on the measurement of the speed of sound in air.  The ultrasonic detector will be highly selective for CO2 and have a precision of one part in 3000 or better, corresponding to a detection limit of 0.1 ppmv.  To compliment the new CO2 detector, a small, lightweight calibration system also will be developed.  In Phase I, an ultrasonic detector for gas chromatography was modified, using a scrubber, to be selective for CO2.  It was determined that, over a wide operating range, the signal was independent of pressure and flow rate.  The best precision was obtained at the lowest flow rate (5 cc/min) and highest pressure (60 psig).  Using measurements of real air samples, the instrument was compared with a conventional CO2 analyzer and found to agree to within 0.3 ?0.3 ppmv.  In Phase II, a new, miniaturized, ultrasonic detector, specific for measurements of CO2 mixing ratios, will be developed and tested.  The sample and reference cells will be in thermal contact to greatly reduce temperature effects on precision and accuracy.  The new instrument will be compared with conventional instrumentation at ground monitoring sites and aboard research aircraft.    Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The ultrasonic detector should result in two commercial products:  (1) a new ultrasonic detector for atmospheric measurements with high precision and accuracy, and (2) a portable calibration system, which does not require compressed gas cylinders, for CO2 measurements.",

The chief sonobuoys targeted in this study are the AN/SSQ-53 DIFAR, AN/SSQ-77 VLAD, and AN/SSQ-62 DICASSunits.  The DIFAR and VLAD buoys are passive devices that have a bandwidth of 5 - 2400 Hz, whereas the DICASS buoy is an active device that has a bandwidth of 6.5 - 9.5 kHz.  All of the sonobuoys contain an orthogonal set of vector sensors of variousdesigns (i.e., dipole hydrophones) and an omni-directional hydrophone (i.e., the so-called scalar sensor) to determine the bearing of a submerged submarine in the horizontal plane.  Nevertheless, the overall intent of the project is to integrate dyadicsensors and the associated signal processing techniques into existing sonobuoy systems so that they have improved directivity and greater noise rejection without changing the aperture.  Of particular interest is using scalar, vector, and dyadic sensors ina synergistic fashion to form the cardioid-squared beam pattern, which has a 3 dB beam width of 94 degrees.  This represents a step gain in performance over current sonobuoys that exploit the cardioid beam pattern, which has a 3 dB beam width of 131degrees.  The use of piezoelectric single crystals will play an important role to support development of small transducers that exhibit high sensitivity and low noise. A step gain in performance over current directional sonobuoys can be achieved if dyadicsensors are used in conjunction with the existing sensors they employ.  It is speculated that the historically large scale production of sonobuoys (e.g., over 10,000 units per year) will drive the cost of single crystal transducers to economically viablelevels that are consistent with those associated with conventional PZT.",

Principal components metrics will be used to quantify generic modeling uncertainty based on past experience,for purposes of evaluating the predictive accuracy of future reliability estimates.  The innovation proposed here will combine the benefits of prediction training and generic uncertainty modeling to quantify the accuracy of reliability predictions based ona statistical comparison of earlier predictions with subsequent observations.  Both will be correlated with measurements of the ambient environment recorded by a data logger.  Statistical analyses of the environmental data will be performed to coincidewith the update of reliability information, reducing the environmental data to time dependent statistical parameters.In addition to providing the Army with a tool for missile reliability prognostics, an immediate spin-off might very well be the applicationto Sandia's maintenance of the Nation's nuclear weapons stockpile, where radiation is an important environmental factor.

Users of power chairs are three times as likely to have accidents as users of manual chairs! Many people can neither walk nor successfully navigate a wheelchair, e.g., many with MS, quadraplegia, spinal stenosis, visual and other impairments.   \nThe Safety Sensing Independence-Enhancing Wheelchair (SIW) has the potential to reduce accident rates dramatically. Moreover, it could enable as many as 88,000 more non-ambulatory Americans to successfully use wheelchairs.  \nDuring Phase I, we built SIW and safety sensor prototypes that met or exceeded all our goals. In Phase II, we will develop a research prototype of SIW with additional functionality. We will complete development of the 2 modes of assisted control: Assistive and One-Click. Manual Mode, in which the wheelchair operates like an ordinary power chair, was integrated in Phase I. For Assistive Mode, we will add redundant sensors to improve the SIW's ability to avoid obstacles at both head and body height. In One-Click mode, those needing the most assistance can travel to destinations, with a single click of an input device, as demonstrated in Phase I. During Phase II, we will continue to extend the capabilities of the localization and navigational algorithms using fuller modeling so that fine-tuning the wheelchair's position will become easier.  \nDuring Phase II we will also finish development of the new lightweight more economical Safety Sensor tested successfully for head and stair sensing in Phase I. We will develop a Universal SIW User Interface to be compatible with nearly any type of input device, as recommended by Phase I feedback from Crotched Mountain Rehabilitation Center (CMRC) and from our 3.5 hour invited demonstration of the Phase I prototype at RESNA 2002. We will also integrate and test various types of seating, as recommended. We will plan assessment, build 3 more prototypes, and conduct lab, field and clinical trials in conjunction with CMRC during Phase II. The results of these trials will be used to design further independent trials and to prepare for the approval process in Phase III.  \nOnce SIW technologies are proven, ordinary chairs that allow users to accidentally drive down stairs will be considered highly unsafe. Moreover, allowing individuals to remain immobile, with no control over their own location, will be considered inhumane when the SIW is available to provide mobility at their command.",

This Phase II study will demonstrate the utility of this protein activity platform. This study has several stages. 1) The platform will be established as a predictive platform for compound toxicity by investigating protein activities of a) cell lines and b) tissues from animals exposed to compounds that have been well-studied using pharmacology, genomics, and other techniques. 2) The resulting protein activity profiles will be integrated into a database that also includes publicly available transcription data, and will allow for seamless correlation of treatments with changes in protein activity levels of the serine hydrolase, cysteine protease, kinase, epoxide hydrolase, and glutathione-S-transferase families.  The activity-based probes (ABPs) for some of these enzyme families are cell-permeable, which is a useful feature that allows for in vivo, rather than in vitro measurements of protein activity in cell lines. 3)  \nCell-permeable derivatives of ABPs that are currently not cell permeable will be synthesized. 4) To expand the breadth of our profiling abilities, ActivX will also design, synthesize and validate ABPs for the phosphatase and cytochrome P450 families. This platform will be useful for detecting toxicity of chemicals, including therapeutics, and will be important for classifying and exploring the molecular basis of toxicities. Therefore, this technology has a great potential for reducing the time and cost in early compound development, and for revealing underlying toxicity mechanisms of different compounds. ActivX plans to commercialize its technology by establishing a toxicoproteomic database, and by providing a service to the pharmaceutical industry that will detect toxicities of compounds early in the drug screening process.",

The key advance in the phase II effort will be the development of anew high power fiber oscillator amplifier pump source for the OPO. The device will build upon the feasibility demonstration in phase I, where an OPO pumped by a diode laser was used to demonstrate spectroscopy of carbon dioxide at 2.7 microns.

However, currently available measurement and analysis techniques are slow and expensive, thus impeding metals remediation using this desirable approach.  Technology is needed for the immediate and inexpensive assessment of metals accumulation in plants during phytoextraction, in order to provide data to allow real-time optimization in cleanup operations.   Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS), serving as an elemental analysis tool applied together with other optical measurements (infrared reflectance spectroscopy, attenuated total reflectance), promises to provide critical information that can drive the transition of phytoremediation from an esoteric technique to a powerful environmental cleanup technology.  Phase I demonstrated that LIBS can detect lead, cadmium, and zinc in plant leaves, with minimal sample preparation, at the levels required to measure plant performance in phytoremediation.  In Phase II, a portable LIBS analyzer will be designed, built, and deployed.  Analytical techniques to combine LIBS data with other optical spectroscopy analytical techniques for optimum control of the phytoremediation process will be established.  Procedures for calibration, data integration, and analysis will be developed and evaluated.     Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  By providing immediate feedback on metals uptake in plants, phytoremediation should become a more cost-effective, viable option at thousands of polluted DOE and industrial sites.

This research method considers the development of special non-linear mathematical models for enginetribology including the lubricating oil film thickness as a function of a series of independent parameters in extreme working conditions.  These modeling equations will be used collectively to model friction in an advance military diesel engine.  Thiscomplete engine friction model will be flexible enough to allow incorporation of other bearing, ring pack, parasitic component or other tribology phenomenon source.  In the Phase I effort, we validated the tribology phenomena modeling equations for thepiston ring cylinder liner interface by a laboratory bench test rig.  This rig has now become a powerful research tool.  In this proposed Phase II effort, the diesel engine tribo-phenomenon source will now be validated by full scale advanced militarydiesel engine fully instrumented with state of the art sensors and measuring equipment.  Such a validation will represent a more accurate computer model.  It will serve as an analytical modeling tool that can either stand alone, or be implemented into adiesel cycle simulator to show what effect frictional variations will have upon diesel engine performance.  We anticipate bi-lateral contributions with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan Automotive Laboratory to provide state of the artinstrumentation advice, model refinement and demostrate the works usefulness not only to the Defense Department, but also to industry.  The possibility of working with MIT's Consortium to further this work also exists.

The effect of friction and wear is critical to the optimization of the performance of high BMEP diesel engines, their hardware reliability and lifeexpectancy predictions.  The development of an engine model into a user friendly interactive PC based model is a great tool and asset to any engine manufacturer or performance minded engine builder.  The modeling of tribological phenomena In this workcould be transferred to commercial diesel engines operating in similar modes.  This would provide the opportunity to expand computer modeling capabilities in other design and developmental hardware areas.

In Phase I of this grant, we demonstrated that a 13C-galactose breath test could be used to assess the degree of impairment of whole body galactose oxidation in more than 90 galactosemic children with a broad spectrum of mutations in the human GALT gene that codes for galactose-l-phosphate uridyltransferase (E C 2 7 7 12). We further demonstrated that this test could be adapted for use in newborn infants with results comparable to those in older children. In Phase II, we will undertake the pre-commercial manufacture and packaging of unit substrate doses for implementation of a field program for secondary screening in the state of Georgia. This program will test the efficacy of outpatient breath testing, using an automated interactive breath collection device and the analysis of breath samples by a new, low-cost mass spectrometer developed for use at the point of care. The results of this crib-side test will be compared with the biochemical and molecular genotyping tests currently used to confirm or deny the diagnosis of infants with an initial positive state-screen test for galactosemia. A rapid assessment of the degree of functional impairment (which is only indirectly predicted from the biochemical and molecular work-up) will enable the physician to differentiate newborns at life-threatening risk from variants of galactosemia before they are exposed to galactose. Implementation of a newly developed 13C-galactose breath test will provide a valuable cost-effective population screening test to measure the degree of impaired galactose metabolism in newborn infants, guide their dietary therapy, and aid in their long-term prognosis.",

        "abstract": "In support of the Navy's goal to develop the SWARM into a highly reliable, long-range aerial observation platform operable by minimally-trained Navy personnel, the capabilities of Phase II powerplants will be substantially expanded over those of Phase I.These powerplants will incorporate an on-board remotely operable starter-generator and computer-controlled fuel injection, enabling the engine to be started and run reliably under a wide range of environmental conditions, as well as reducing the requiredtraining of Navy personnel to a minimum.In Phase II of this program we will continue engine development to improve the Specific Fuel Consumption over Phase I levels.  Uninterrupted endurance with JP-5/JP-8 fuels will also be increased significantly over Phase I results.  Ceramic components willbe developed and integrated to facilitate these goals.  The design of the engine will also be expanded to include a larger engine size of approximately 2 in3.  As applicable to further the project goals, we will also partner with others in the field, suchas Davis Diesel Development and Aerosonde, to take full advantage of their small UAV engine development experience and expertise.  Production costs for lots of 100 and 1000 units will be estimated for both engine sizes.  Five samples of each prototypeengine size will be provided.  Also, as determined by the contract officer, we will incorporate into the development program the muffler and propeller technologies being developed by other Navy contractors. The various technologies being developed under this program will be incorporated into the full system design in an incremental fashion that ensures that at each stage of the development process we will have a fully functioning engine that is better thanits' predecessor from the previous stage.  For example, the JP-5/JP-8 operational capabilities will first be expanded using existing metal engines.  Only later, when the operational capabilities with JP-5/JP-8 have matured to a point of reliability, willthe ceramic components be introduced.  That way, at any stage of the development process the Navy will have a functional, reliable small JP-5/JP-8 powerplant that can be considered for immediate emergency use.  Similarly, the starter/generator will beintegrated into ceramic designs only after being successfully developed with existing engines.  We will also investigate incorporating technologies that allow the powerplant to be reused with minimal refurbishment after saltwater landings of the SWARM.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   \nScientists have documented the phenomenon of fetal ceils in maternal blood, and envisioned using them for noninvasive prenatal screening. A key limiting factor is the small number of fetal cells in the maternal circulation, making fetal cell isolation difficult and limiting the accuracy of genetic analysis. Current emphasis is on simple, practical and reproducible methods for enrichment and genetic testing of fetal cells.   \nThe goal of this project is to develop simple semi-automated methods for enrichment, detection, and diagnosis of fetal cells in maternal blood. This project combines recent advances in fetal progenitor cell research, with a novel enrichment approach, and speedy automated cell detection for prenatal genetic analysis.    \nIn the Phase I study we evaluated the feasibility of automatically detecting May-Giemsa stained nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs) using transmitted light microscopy, followed by fetal gender and/or aneuploidy detection via fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH). Our results demonstrated that NRBCs are present in the maternal blood stream during pregnancy, and can be effectively enriched to proportions that are conducive to automated cell detection. We also observed that these cells may not be the ideal target cell, because most of these cells are at late stages of differentiation and undergoing apoptosis. Moreover, we found that the suitability of NRBCs for FISH analysis was highly variable as it is related to its state of differentiation. Consequently, we evaluated the potential of fetal progenitor cells as an alternative cell type for prenatal screening. For separation and enrichment, we employed a more simple isolation method that would allow for detection of more that one fetal progentior cell type. We adopted the Rosette Method (StemCell Technologies, Inc) to achieve the selective enrichment of hematopoietic progenitor cell types from whole blood with reduced cell loss. The enriched samples were then successfully processed via FISH to identify male fetal cells in maternal blood.   \nIn the Phase II study, we will (i) evaluate automated analysis for detection efficiency of fetal cells based on the presence of FISH signals in the clinical environment, and (ii) relocate fetal cells identified in aim 1 and record fetal cell descriptors based on cellular shape, density, and size. This information will then be used to further develop automated parameters for morphological identification of progenitor fetal cells, and (iii) based on the results of aim 1 and 2, we will implement the final modifications and/or optimizations to fully develop a semi-automated imaging system for the detection and analysis of fetal cells in maternal blood using transmitted and fluorescence microscopy.  \nThe ultimate goal of much of the current research in medical cytogenetics is to make low-cost, low-risk prenatal genetic screening widely available. This project will develop instrumentation that will be vital in the realization of this goal. The innovative technological approach presented here has the potential to revolutionize the future of prenatal diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   \nAutomated karyotyping is an important procedure in cytogenetics labs worldwide. Multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) is a relatively recent development that uses multicolor chromosome painting probes and multispectral image analysis to identify subtle and complex chromosomal rearrangements. It promises to make automated karyotyping faster, more accurate, and easier to interpret, both in clinical situations and in cancer research. The major factor limiting the ability of M-FISH instruments to resolve the chromosomal origin of the DNA in abnormal chromosomes is pixel classification accuracy. The goal of this project is to develop improved software techniques to improve significantly the accuracy of pixel classification in M-FISH systems, thereby maximizing the impact of this important new technology on the practice of cytogenetics. The instruments that are commercially available now implement only relatively rudimentary pixel classification algorithms for identifying the homologue origin of chromosomal DNA. In this project, we apply state-of-the-art pattern recognition techniques to M-FISH to improve pixel classification accuracy far beyond what is currently offered by commercial systems. The improved M-FISH system that will result from this research will automatically find and flag both subtle and complex structural abnormalities (insertions and translocations of genetic material) with high accuracy, thereby assisting both cancer research and genetic diagnosis. Having established feasibility of several algorithmic innovations in Phase I, we plan, in Phase II, to develop these improvements fully and test the system in routine clinical use on prenatal, postnatal and cancer specimens from amniocentesis, peripheral blood, and bone marrow. The enhancements will be integrated into commercially available M-FISH instruments. The resulting second generation commercial instruments will be superior to currently available systems for elucidating structural rearrangements within chromosomes. Certain of the techniques will be published as well, to the benefit of others using M-FISH.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this effort is to create an innovative bioinformatics platform for microarray data management and analysis. This platform will overcome the following limitations inherent in current microarray systems: (1) current systems typically do notaddress all types of array data, (2) current systems do not record the context of the samples, which hinders scientific and statistically relevant queries of the data, and (3) current systems do not track computational processes, which hampers dataanalysis. In order to take advantage of microarrays and manage the massive volume of data produced by them, scientists must have bioinformatics platforms like the one we are developing for this research. We propose to couple a highly sophisticatedLaboratory Information Management System (LIMS) to a pioneering analysis information management system (AIMS) that executes computational processes and interfaces with external bioinformatics tools as well as databases. The integration of LIMS and AIMSwill produce dramatic benefits for researchers throughout the DOD's Defense Technology Area Plan in Infectious Diseases of Military Importance by improving research quality and decreasing time to biological discovery. Some of the technologies used in thisresearch were developed by 3rd Millennium for an Advanced Technology Program (ATP) grant (see Related Work section).The bioinformatics platform we are developing will benefit both the government and the private sector in drug development, toxicologystudies, and disease treatment by improving research quality and decreasing time to biological discovery. For example, the platform will aid disease treatment by facilitating the development of gene expression molecular phenotype classifiers for diseasestates. These classifiers can be used to match drugs to the diseases against which they will be the most effective. The search engine we implemented in Phase 1 of the research and will develop further in Phase 2 can aid in the construction of suchclassifiers. The sophisticated engine can also help in drug development by identifying genes that are suitable drugable targets and have altered expression profiles in the disease state relative to the healthy state. Also, databases of expression profileslike the one we implemented in Phase 1 are already being used in drug toxicology studies to determine if candidate drugs have molecular phenotypes that are known to be toxic. Expression profile databases have also shown utility in identifying the functionof genes that lack annotations. This is especially helpful for researchers who are working with organisms that have poorly annotated genomes like the disease causing agents Plasmodium falciparum (malaria) and Bacillus anthracis (anthrax). In order torealize the full potential of functional genomic technologies like microarrays, researchers throughout the DOD and private sector need bioinformatics platforms like the one we successfully developed for Phase 1 of the research and will develop further inPhase 2. Finally, technologies developed for this proposal will also be extremely effective for the management and analysis of other functional genomic data such as proteomic and metabolic data.",

        "abstract": "In this research project, Advanced Fuel Research, Inc., addresses two important environmental problems:  (1) removal and recovery of mercury from combustion/incineration flue gas, and (2) reprocessing of waste tires into value-added products.  Coal combustion and incineration of municipal and hazardous wastes results in air pollution due to emissions of trace amounts of heavy metals.  Because of the high toxicity of these species, their emissions are or will be regulated.  The high volatility of mercury makes control of this metal particularly difficult.  Scrap tires present formidable disposal problems, as they are known to be immune to biological degradation. \n\nLandfilling of the 280 million tires that are generated each year in the United States is an unacceptable solution.  In addition to the continuous flow of waste tires, there are approximately 2-3 billion tires already stored in piles throughout the country (http://home.snafu.de/kurtr/str/en.html).  Legal dumping also is a problem.  The tires take up large amounts of valuable landfill space, provide breeding sites for mosquitoes and rodents, and present fire and health hazards.  \n\nThe proposed approach is based on mercury adsorption on low-cost, sulfur-rich activated carbons derived from scrap tires.  The sulfur added to tire rubber in the process of vulcanization makes the tire-derived sorbents particularly effective in mercury removal due to the high chemical affinity between mercury and sulfur.  Two possible implementations of the process are envisaged:  (1) sorbent injection into the flue-gas duct (near-term applications), and (2) a patented regenerative scheme (long-term applications).  The overall objective of the project is to develop a novel and effective technology for mercury control using sorbents derived from waste tires.  The objective of the Phase I project was to demonstrate the superior price-performance characteristics for waste tire-derived activated carbons under simulated industrial conditions, which was successfully accomplished.  The Phase II objective is to optimize sorbent properties as a function of carbon-preparation conditions, and to advance the product to pilot scale (Phase II Option).  This will be accomplished through the following tasks:  (1) sorbent optimization, (2) sorbent performance, (3) product evaluation, and (4) pilot-scale testing (Phase II Option).  \n\nThe main result of this research will be a novel technology for the removal of mercury from combustion/incineration flue gas combined with the simultaneous utilization of massive amounts of solid waste (scrap tires).  The obvious applications for the process are coal-fired power plants, as well as municipal, medical, and hazardous waste incinerators.",

This design was selected among others to be developed in full scale in Phase II and Phase II Option based on a detailed theoretical modeling, smallprototype test results, and a cost analysis, which were conducted in Phase I.In Phase II and Phase II Option a new generation of TVA utilizing a class of magneto-rheological (MR) materials as the controllable medium will be designed, built and tested in full scale.  This system will provide controllable vibration isolation for theUS Navy's FBM launch system.  The proposed TVA system consists of a MR material, a compact device, and a robust control system.  The proposed system offers advantages, such as, fail-safe, material stability, lack of seal wear, and environmental protectioncorrosive nature of seawater.The effort to achieve the objectives includes: (1) material preparation and characterization of a MR material system suitable for this particular application, (2) theoretical study, design, and construction of the proposed large-scale MR-based TVA device,(3) design and implementation of a robust control system that can provide accurate and fast response, and (4) full-scale testing of the integrated system (Phase II Option). The anticipated result for the Phase II and Phase II Option MR-based TVA will be full-scale device that supports a flexible payload for future FBM launch system applications.  This device will provide a controllable reaction force through energizing anelectromagnet that then changes the MR-based material storage and loss properties.  MR-based materials can have a significant increase in their storage modulus in the presence of a magnetic field.  The Phase II and Phase II option MR-based TVA large-scaleprototype and testing will be the bridge to Phase III production delivery.It is also anticipated to extend the benefits of this technology to other applications and markets through product development for both military and private sectors.   In addition to the FBM launch system applications, other Department of Defenseapplications include: HMMWV, weapon recoil systems, flexible gun tubes, helicopter main rotor assembles and suspension mechanisms of ground combat vehicles providing enhanced ground speed over rough terrain.  A MR-based TVA may significantly enhance theperformance of systems such as the 30mm and 40mm chain gun, 50 caliber machine guns, large caliber tank artillery, and even individual crew served tactical weapon systems.Private sector commercialization opportunities exist for light and heavy-duty vehicle suspension, vehicle engine mounts and bushings, aircraft landing gear systems, rotating machinery and power plant mounts, sensitive electronic equipment vibrationisolation, as well as automation and motion control for industrial manufacturing systems.",

This will allow frequent automatic or manual signal quality checks during the study. The proposed device will improve the success rate of at-home sleep studies.  Concerns over the need to repeat home sleep tests because sensors such as effort belts, finger pulse oximeters, and nasal canulas can become dislodged, have limited the acceptance of home sleep studies. In the proposed system, if a sensor problem is discovered, a technician can be alerted to make a decision if the patient should be contacted at home to correct the sensor placement, or if enough data has been collected to allow a scoreable test.   Increased reliability of at-home sleep disorder testing will significantly lower the overall costs of performing such tests and ultimately expand access to sleep disorder testing. A human test sleep program will be conducted to compare the new sleep apnea screener against a gold standard.",

The problem is that today\u00bfs cathode materials do not allow the specific energy and power density targets to be achieved while simultaneously being low cost, safe under abusive conditions, and environmentally benign.  This project will develop electronically conductive lithium cathode materials, which have low raw- materials and manufacturing costs, high energy and power densities, and are electrochemically stable under extreme conditions, and environmentally benign.  In Phase I, compositions and synthesis procedures were developed for a class of doped, lithium-transition-metal-phosphate cathodes having electronic conductivities exceeding 10-3 S/cm at room temperature as well as novel nanoparticulate morphologies enabling high utilization at high rates.  Cathodes of conventional formulations were fabricated and tested, and exhibited high charge capacities of 155 mAh/g at low rates (C/5) while also retaining capacities as high as 75 mAh/g for 50C rate deep discharge.  These properties suggest exceptional continuous discharge and pulse-power capabilities in full cells.  In Phase II, a pilot-scale process will be developed for cathodes that can meet DOE cost targets in full-scale production.  Cells with greater than 0.2Ah capacity will be developed using these cathodes.  Pulse-power, cycle life, and accelerated-calendar-life tests will be conducted according to DOE protocols.     Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The new cathode material should allow for the development of high power density, low cost batteries that are safe at larger cell sizes.

API?s intent is twofold: First, to design the wing and fuselage configurations and boundary layer ingestion features for a very high fraction of laminar flow and greatly reduced parasitic drag. Second, to match the mass flow of the ingested boundary layer, the turbofan engine(s) and the aircraft cruise thrust requirement at the cruise design point to yield an extremely high level of propulsive efficiency.

The ultimate goal of this effort is to develop an integrated general framework for rapid detection ofinsider attacks for simultaneous defense of information systems on all required levels, which range from small local sub-networks to global distributed enterprise networks. In Phase I, the feasibility of our approach to rapid detection of internal attackswas demonstrated. In Phase II, we will further develop, implement, and test advanced statistical methods for defense against cyber-terrorism in high-speed computer networks. Powerful statistical techniques, such as adaptive change-point detection methods,hidden Markov models, and statistical learning, will be exploited in order to develop an optimized global distributed intrusion detection system that overcomes the major drawbacks and limitations of current detection systems. This system will have anadaptive, re-configurable structure that utilizes auto-tuning and auto-selection procedures for optimal configuration, reducing susceptibility to changes in environment. We will use collected data to tune and to optimize the detection system and to testthe prototype using state-of-the-art testbeds. Prototype software will be delivered and demonstrated at the end of Phase II.This effort will develop robust, mathematically rigorous, and, in certain senses, statistically optimal defense techniques. Thedevelopment will be carried out in a generic way so that these methods can be readily adapted to any insider intrusion defense implementation. As a result, this work will significantly increase the likelihood that an effective defense system will bedeveloped. We anticipate that this system, which is based on the advanced change-point detection method, will offer crucial improvements, specifically increased detection probability for unknown attacks, lower false alarm rates, and lower detection times,when compared to existing systems. We also anticipate that the distributed, scalable configuration will offer further improvements in overall performance in terms of lowering false alarm rates and increasing detection capabilities at high data rates.The successful completion of this program will result in the commercialization of the most advanced algorithm available for rapid detection of attacks in government, commercial and enterprise networks. The developed intrusion detection software will beparticularly effective in protecting these networks against insider threats. The complete software package can also be used by financial institutions in order to increase the security of their existing networks.",

However, our oil separator combines the inertia separation mechanism with an electrohydrodynamic (EHD) separation mechanism to produce a device with a high separationefficiency over the entire operating range of CO2 heat pumps.  Our Phase I experimental results with a prototype EHD separator showed a dramatic increase in oil separation efficiency using supercritical CO2.  In Phase II, we will improve upon our designand develop a commercial-ready model.In the area of CO2 heat exchangers during Phase I, we developed an improved method for manifolding high-pressure heat exchangers.  Our manifold overcomes the difficulties of fabricating multi-pass/multi-row heat exchangers that can withstand high pressure.Also, our manifolding system will make it easier to reduce two-phase flow maldistribution.  During Phase II, we will design, fabricate, and test a superior heat exchanger for a 3-ton CO2 heat pump system.The two innovative components we are developing willovercome some of the major difficulties that CO2 systems are currently facing, thus improving the COP and energy efficiency of CO2 systems.  Our EHD oil separator will allow effective oil circulation in the compressor while minimizing the deterioratingheat transfer performance and increased pressure drop of the presence of oil in microchannel heat exchangers.

The system combines the capability of an EPA recommended model for atmospherictransport and dispersion with a robust automatic differentiation software package to develop an adjoint model for inverse plume modeling. The measurements obtained from the monitoring network and the adjoint calculations are assimilated based on an optimalscheme utilizing the uncertainty values. Incorporated with near real-time observational meteorological and radionuclide data, the developed system will be an operational tool for the detection of nuclear test events and accidents.  This developed softwarehas a very high commercialization potential. The developed software system can be used to support the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). It can also be used for emergency planning and post-accident investigation for both governmental and privateindustrial applications. In the government markets, there is currently a large need for a product with the capability proposed in this project. Potential application areas include the identification and quantification of sources for nuclear, biological,chemical, and other events. The federal customers include almost all the major agencies such as DOD, DOE, EPA, NASA, and DOC. We estimate the annual market size for the government is about $50 million/year.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  EIderly falls constitute one of the most costly health problems in the U.S., both in terms of expense to the healthcare system and in individual suffering. Fully one-third of people over age 65 fall each year, many incurring significant injuries that strongly impact their long-term health prospects and productivity. Although many factors contribute to the propensity of the elderly to fall, it has been clearly shown that loss of peripheral sensation (particularly in foot sole and lower extremity muscles and joints) is key among them. A technology that directly improves peripheral sensation would be instrumental in combating elderly falls. Developing this technology is the long-range goal of this program.  \nStochastic resonance (SR) is a counterintuitive phenomenon in which slight amounts of noise presented to a system increases its ability to discern weak signals or stimuli. Many researchers have shown that SR can improve the performance of sensory systems in animal models and human subjects. Afferent Corporation's Phase I SBIR research demonstrated that SR-based stimulation of foot-sole significantly improved balance in elderly subjects.  \nThe goal of this proposed research is to advance the Phase 1 results toward a commercially realizable stimulation system to improve the balance and gait of elderly. The work will focus first on the development of pre-production fully functioning models of an insole that provides mechanical SR stimulation. The functional benefits of these devices will be tested in three ways: (1) standing balance (quiet and perturbed), (2) adaptation following prolonged exposure, and (3) gait (normal and perturbed) and mobility. Both healthy elderly and elderly subjects who are known to suffer from instability and falls will be studied. Established, quantitative measures of balance, gait, and mobility will be used to analyze results from trials that are blinded to both the subject and the technician performing the experiment. The results gained from this program are expected to motivate a full-fledged product development effort, regulatory filings, and market introduction.",

Therefore, methods that improve efficiency and reduce the cost of producing catfish would be a tremendous asset to the industry. The hybrid catfish between channel catfish female and blue catfish males has been shown to have many superior characteristics compared to channel catfish, the species which accounts for virtually all catfish culture in the US. The most reliable method to produce hybrid catfish is by hormonal induction of channel catfish for ovulation, hand stripping of eggs, and artificial fertilization with blue catfish sperm, and hatching in troughs. Limited fry production is a major impediment for large-scale adoption of the hybrid catfish fry production. Research on the hybrid catfish production will focus to optimize LHRHa dosages based on gonadal maturity of female catfish, develop techniques to determine egg quality, optimize antifungal formalin treatments and to determine proper nutritional preparation of broodstock to further optimize hybrid fry production. Economic analyses on the risk of producing the hybrid fry based on best treatments would be compared with the traditional method of channel catfish fry production.",

The proposed system will enable clinicians to more readily incorporate breast MR into their decision-making and patient care. The specific aim is to develop an integrated methodology to improve sensitivity rates of radiologists with minimal clinical experience in breast MR to levels that approximate sensitivity rates of radiologists with extensive experience in breast MR. The integrated methodology has three components: 1) Enhance the interpretation model previously proposed by Nunes, Schanll, et al. to contain additional decision nodes based on lesion density and kinetics. 2) Provide readers with a CAD system that displays quantitative and visualization aids to assist in the interpretation at the decision nodes. 3) Generate training tools and case studies for teaching radiologists how to interpret and identify lesion characteristics.

Image processing has not previously been used in educational motion detection. Compared to the commonly used methods--real-time one-dimensional graphing and frame-by-frame analysis of stored video--this innovation has many advantages, such as the simultaneous real-time display of video and graphs, multidimensional operation, ability to operate over any distance scale, display of the shape and orientation of objects, and the automatic generation of stroboscope-like images. This innovation creates the opportunity to surpass in learning effectiveness and ease-of-use the technologies now used widely in high school and college physics for the study of motion.  In addition it will potentially reach a much larger group--mathematics classrooms from middle school through college. The system will operate with ordinary classroom computers and ordinary digital video cameras.\n\nUsed in conjunction with inquiry-based curricula, Alberti's' Windows' system will be primarily used in physics and mathematics education classes.  Improving the teaching of physics and mathematics is basic to science literacy and is essential to creating a technologically capable workforce.  Ultimately, the following potential markets can also be explored: CAD/CAM, physiological/medical testing, sports, industrial monitoring and control, videogames, and security.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   \nNuclear Medicine imaging is being widely used to preoperatively image structures of interest for excisional biopsy. Radioguided intraoperative procedures utilizing radiotracers have established cost effective, highly specific means to locate suspect tissue and access it for pathologic analysis and excision. The ability of intraoperative probes to locate malignancies is based on the fact that the uptake of radiopharmaceutical in tumors is higher compared to healthy tissue. The benefits of radiogiuded surgery include increased tissue specifity obtained for biopsy, minimally accessed incisions and, as a result, reduction of inpatient hospital utilization and improved patient recovery.  \n  \nMost current commercial surgical probes are designed to be used with gamma-emitting radiotracers. The highly penetrating gamma radiation arising from the whole body overwhelms the signal from the region of interest, limiting the practical use of these probes by severely degrading signal-to-noise ratio. Existing counting probes lacking the imaging capability fail to detect small tumors and nodes in the proximity of high radioactivity injection site.  \n  \nWe propose to address these limitations by designing a next-generation intraoperative probe utilizing both gamma and gamma radiation from such dual emitters as 131I and 18F. The new probe will rapidly navigate to the malignancy site by detecting long-range gamma rays and then will acquire an image of the region of interest with short-range beta rays. Therefore, the signal registered in the image will be arising only from the area directly in front of the detector. This novel design will fulfill the need for clear delineation of tumors during the surgical procedure and will facilitate decision-making process for the surgeon during the surgery. Furthermore, the new probe will allow inspection of the tumor bed for remaining malignant tissue to confirm the completeness of the excision.",

With the ever increasing number of human disease models (including cancer) in the small laboratory animals such as mice and rats, high resolution PET imaging of small animals can contribute unique information. The critical advantage of PET is that it allows functional information to be obtained non-invasively, so each animal can be studied repeatedly. Thus, it is clear that PET imaging of small animals is highly desirable. Clinical PET scanners used for human imaging are bulky, expensive and do not have adequate spatial resolution for small animal studies. Hence, dedicated, low cost instruments are required for conducting small animal studies with higher spatial resolution than what is currently achieved with clinical PET scanners. The goal of the proposed Phase II project is to investigate a novel approach to produce a prototype small animal PET imager with very high spatial resolution and high sensitivity.

The ability of X-rays to penetratedeep in to matter allows investigation of interior components with possibility of real-time dynamic studies. However, while significant advances have been made in X-ray sources as well as image processing steps, the X-ray detectors remain a limiting stepin many of applications. Important requirements for the X-ray detectors used in such applications include large area (~ 20 cm x 20 cm), high resolution (100-200 um), wide dynamic range (10~), high sensitivity, compact design, and low cost. Ability toprovide real-time images is an additional requirement in some applications. None of the present detectors satisfy all these requirements. To address this situation, we have proposed to develop a solid state, large area, high resolution imaging detector bycombining the semiconductor film (lead iodide, PbI2) technology being developed at RMID with the large format amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) readout technology. The detectors would be capable of performing static as well as dynamic imaging. We will explore theuse of these detectors in NDE and medical imaging applications in the Phase II research.The proposed detectors would find wide usage in non destructive evaluation and medical radiology markets.

In addition, we plan to conduct the animal toxicology experiments and produce the clinical trial materials required to initiate human studies of inhaled dronabinol. Accomplishment of these goals of Phase II will lead directly to human clinical testing of a cost effective, commercially viable dronabinol inhalation delivery system.

SAPGEN will be developed to predict interlaminar failures, multi-site cracks initiation and propagation, establish design guidelines and inspection intervals, and evaluationof manufacturing flaws regarding part life.A Commercial version of Alpha STAR's, GENOA life prediction software is used in the SAPGEN code. Our extensive software development expertise contained in GENOA Commercialized life prediction software will be used, by identifying a convenient user-friendlysubset of this software, `SAPGEN'.  The intent of the SAPGEN software is to provide the nucleus and foundation that will serve as an engineering design aid specific for naval composite structures and associated industrial practitioners.The SAPGEN code can accurately simulate structural damage, including hygral and thermal effects, under static, dynamic, impact, creep, stability, low and high cycle fatigue, and random power spectral density loads.  The software uses material test data,and uncertainty at the material local level to simulate structure level damage initiation, growth, and propagation processes and determines the true global safety factors associated with each component design. Changes in structural load paths with damageprogression are accurately identified based on physics and material properties.  Manufacturing processes variability, and anomalies (voids, defects, etc) can be accounted as part of life prediction simulation. Virtual structural health monitoring andnon-destructive evaluation (i.e. inspection) are monitored via exhausted energy release rate.SAPGEN will perform adhesively bonded joint analysis by: 1) automatic mesh generation, 2) material constituent analysis (MCA), 3) material uncertainty analysis (MUA), 4) progressive failure analysis (PFA), 5) damage minimization, and 6) time dependentreliability of. SAPGEN will be used to predict, under all operational conditions (temperature/thermal gradient, humidity, oxidative/corrosive agents): 1) constituent/ply mechanical properties, 2) property degradation by implementing the multifactorinteraction model, and 3) effects of bond line strength/thickness/voids on failure, 3) durability/reliability of a typical marine composite joint/structure, including determination of the failure mechanisms contribution to the critical damage events (crackinitiation/propagation), residual strength, sensitivity of joint design parameters (e.g. configuration, bond-thickness, ply-schedule) to the probability of failure.  Figure 2- 1 shows the SAPGEN flow chart and compares the software damage predictioncapability against ABAQUS software.  ASC's software development team adheres to ISO9000 processes, software control, and has established appropriate security firewalls in support of client's project needs. The benefits of the SAPGEN software modules, and the functionalities of each module is shown in Table 2-1.Some of these SAPGEN capabilities have been introduced in the developmental verification case studies.  Most importantly the capabilities of the total GENOA software system can be drawn upon to progressively enhance later versions of the SAPGEN softwareduring Phase 2 and Phase 3 development as the user community becomes more familiar and accomplished with the initial release of SAPGEN.Table 2-1.

The past two decades of computer vision research have seen considerable advances in wireframe construction from stereoscopic imagery, but significant limitations still exist in today's state-of-the-art systems: interactivemodel construction is laborious and time intensive, while automated systems create numerous spurious objects and incorrect hypotheses due to physical phenomena such as reflectance, shadows, and occlusion.     Our Phase I effort demonstrated a model-based approach that discriminates among competing wireframe hypotheses. These hypotheses are constructed using image features such as lines and corners, as well as by applying combinations of physicalRobust metrics compare the original stereo imagery with synthetic prediction images generated by each model, incorporating visibility information such as shadows and obscuration.  This hypothesis evaluation guides the refinement of parameters such as roofheight to improve accuracy. Our Phase II effort will extend the Phase I technologies and create an end-to-end prototype system for automated wireframe generation for subsequent transition into existing application frameworks.",

        "abstract": "While there have been a number of recent advances in track precision and maintenance via the AMSTE program, long-term track maintenance remains an elusive goal. Track breaks are primarily the result of miss-detections due to micro-obscuration from foliageand buildings and or due to the vehicle dropping below Minimum Detectable Velocity (MDV) because of parking or stopping at intersections and yields. These unpredictable areas of miss-detections and the resulting track breaks are a tracking fact of life andhave gone largely un-addressed.ALPHATECH's proposes to continue the successful Phase I effort to develop and refine new High Range Resolution (HRR) scoring technologies that connect the resulting track segments and the use of road map information to help in the nomination. Aditionally,ALPHATECH will design innovative target motion models, methods for inferring probability of detection maps and regionally adaptive tracking techniques that are necessary for a system to maintains situational awareness on high priority targets.",

At the conclusion of the effort, detailed drawings will be prepared along with a final report that documents all project results.  A successful ACTSdemonstration will result in the availability of a military trigeneration system that will support the power and heating or cooling needs of command and control shelters.  Besides reducing power and cooling costs, system weight, size and fuel consumption,ACTS will reduce noise and emissions that make current systems problematic.  In addition, these systems can be commercially used to provide power, and heating or cooling in off the grid type applications.  These applications might be as extensive asmilitary applications, resulting in the production of over 100,000 units.  The fuel use reductions for these units would be worth $70 million/year.",

Current ad hoc methods of managing internal research data are prone to error   and time consuming. The Phase I prototype Research Data Management System (RDMS) proved the viability of   utilizing the Pl's commercially successful content management system (created with the open source web based   database platform technology of Linux/PHP/MySQL/Java) to successfully develop a scalable, affordable, and   commercially viable solution which will provide the ability to (a) easily collect data directly from laboratory instruments,   (b) easily and automatically couple the data with annotation information that describes and explains it, (c) easily store,   retrieve, share, and analyze the data and associated documents in a secure environment accessible via the Internet.   Phase 1 results achieved each its Specific Aims and exceeded the expectations of the alpha testers at UCSF Cancer   Center and Gladstone Institute. The Pl's goal for this Phase II proposal is to develop a scalable, commercially viable   version of the RDMS to fulfill the needs of academic and small to medium commercial laboratories in a user-friendly   and affordable manner. Phase II will scale the software to a broad range of instrumentation data types, a greater set of   annotation and retrieval tools, and different biomedical research end points. Phase II will utilize the expertise of the   Gladstone Institute Flow Cytometry Core and the UCSF Laboratory for Cell Analysis for specification design and   testing. In addition, core labs at the Fox Chase Cancer Center, Carnegie-Mellon, and Lawrence Berkeley National   Laboratory will participate in beta testing. Development of such an online system has profound implications by creating   enabling technology with the following impact: 1) increase the progress rate of a research study or patient analysis, 2)   Increase the continuity of research efforts as personnel in laboratories change, 3) Increase the ability to collaborate   between researchers at different sites, 4) Increase the ability to verify or utilize past research study and patient analysis   results, and 5) Increase the security of perhaps irreproducible data and analyses.

In the Phase I grant, we developed a stable, active formulation of protease from Aspergillus melleus, TheraCLEC-Protease, for use in the treatment of chronic abdominal pain in chronic pancreatitis and also along with TheraCLEC-Lipase and amylase for the treatment of malabsorption as a result of pancreatic insufficiency in cystic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis.  TheraCLEC-Protease exhibited product characteristics superior to commercially available pancreatic enzyme products. TheraCLEC-Protease exhibited a very high level of activity against casein and stability under low pH and towards various proteases present in the intestine. Moreover, in the preliminary investigations, the TheraCLEC-Protease did not show any toxicity. Based on these results in Phase II, we will prepare a drug product prototype for use in the treatment of abdominal pain in chronic pancreatitis and along with TheraCLEC-Lipase for use in the treatment of pancreatic insufficiency, azotorrhea and steatorrhea in cystic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis patients. As a first step, we will crystallize and crosslink the protease with methods developed in Phase I Subsequently, we will mix TheraCLEC-Protease with TheraCLEC-Lipase and amylase for use in a final formulation or alone depending on the disease and type of treatment. The final formulation will be tested for efficacy in digesting proteins and fats in dogs with ligated pancreatic ducts. Using radiolabeled TheraCLEC-Protease, we will follow the lack of absorption into the systemic circulation. In addition, we will test the subacute, subchronic and long-term effects of feeding TheraCLEC-Protease in two species. If successful, a TheraCLEC-Protease prototype will provide an efficient treatment for abdominal pain. TheraCLEC-Protease will be ready to enter clinical trials, and will provide a novel treatment for pancreatic insufficiency in chronic pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis along with TheraCLECLipase.",

It was demonstrated that substantiallyhigher fill factor and smaller pixel size could be achieved using common CMOS technology. Well capacity and linearity of the sensor were also shown to be superior to both CCD and APS designs. The approach, multiplexed oversample A/D, MOSAD is based on amodification of the well understood Delta Sigma A/D technology. A new design for a large high speed monolithic visible light camera will be developed with this technology. The potential to achieve high frame rates, beyond 1,000 fps, in a large array ofover 4,000 X 3,000 pixels will be developed with demonstration of working hardware. The development will be based on using off the shelf CMOS processes to design and build a custom camera sensor array chip. Optimum sensitivity will be achieved using afront side illuminated silicon photo diode detector. Projected fill factor of the monolithic sensor will exceed 48% at pixel sizes down to a 5.4 micron pitch. A complete camera system will be demonstrated at the conclusion of the program.Visible lightcameras developed using CCD and APS approaches have been severely limited in the ability to sense bright high photon count scenes. Both approaches are limited in well capacity and linearity and must be stopped down to work in bright scenes. APS is furtherlimited by high nonuniformity limiting applications to about 8 bits at most. The MOSAD technology improves the sensor for bright scene application by providing the well capacity and linearity necessary without stopping down in the optics. This will allowgreater dynamic range needed in the medical instruments and industrial control systems. Objects lost in the shadows with CCD and APS cameras will be visible with MOSAD cameras.",

Residential location and neighborhood context are important factors that affect the life chances of individuals, families, and minorities. Two problems hinder general understanding of segregation patterns and the forces that shape them. First, the research literature relies on technical, quantitative indices computed from specialized data sets to document segregation patterns and trends. Second, conventional methodologies for exploring effects of hypothesized determinants of segregation (market forces, the spatial and demographic organization of cities, household preferences, constraints imposed by discrimination, etc.) require advanced data analysis skills. To overcome these problems Mark Fossett of Texas A&M University authored SimSeg, a computer program that uses intuitive graphical presentations to help students comprehend segregation patterns and simulation capabilities to help researchers explore different theories about the determinants of segregation patterns. In Phase II, Amber Waves Software and Texas A&M will refine and extend the SimSeg model by: 1) improving its ability to represent the spatial and demographic structure of American cities, 2) enhancing its model of household residential choices, 3) enabling the model to represent any set of ethnic groups, 4) developing tools that will enable students, researchers, and social science professionals to build their own simulation scenarios, 5) working with outside sociologists to ensure the scientific merits of the SimSeg model, and 6) conducting extensive internal verification and external validation exercises.

The target cells will  be  selected by Laser Capture Micro-dissection (LCM). The product line will include aRNA derived from normal mice and from mutant mice that serve as models of human neurodegenative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and ataxia telangiectasia. The product will be targeted to researchers carrying out expression profiling studies that aim to understand the molecular basis of normal neurological function and the molecular pathology of neurological disease.  During the first year, efforts will be focused on scaling up procedures for sample processing, micro-dissection, and RNA isolation and amplification from normal mice. During the second year the procedures will be applied to the mutant strains. The aRNA will be produced using T7-mediated in vitro transcription. In order to help meet the anticipated Production-scale goals, efforts will be directed to adapting the procedures, especially RNA amplification, to a robotic platform. In order to assess the RNA from micro-dissected samples for quality assurance purposes, molecular markers will be identified to use for verifying that the RNA is derived from the intended cell population. Efforts will also be directed to improving methods for identifying target cells for micro-dissection in samples such as tumors, where target cells (e.g. malignant cells) cannot always be distinguished by histological staining. The methods will be compatible with isolation of intact RNA from the selected cells, so that it can be amplified for    use in microarray expression profiling assays. To meet this goal we will develop rapid fluorescent detection methods using primary fluorescent antibodies directed to tumor antigens, and we will also adapt detection of target cells in transgenic animals expressing Green Fluorescent Protein for use with LCM.  Achieving these goals will provide aRNA from distinct cellular subtypes to neuroscience researchers who do not currently have access to this resource. Use of aRNA from defined cell subtypes, as opposed to bulk tissue, will improve the ability to make biologically meaningful conclusions from expression profiling experiments carried out on highly heterogeneous tissues such as brain. Another goal of the project is to release a kit for recovery of high-quality total RNA from microdissected samples, especially those obtained by LCM. The kit will be of general use to life science researchers working with micro-scale samples.",

The major tasks of Phase II include the systemhardware fabrication and installation, refinement of pointing and navigation algorithms, and integration of all necessary modules for building a practical system. During Phase II, first, AGNC will perform the work for mounting and alignment of the IMU onthe artillery barrel. This task includes the ruggedization of the IMU units and the system package, mounting of the IMU units and the system package, and compensation of the misalignment between the IMU body axis and the barrel boresight. To eliminate thecable wiring on the artillery barrel, AGNC will build an RF data link for data transmission from the IMUs to the navigation processor. Next, the optimal multiple IMU configuration, FDI processing algorithms, and optimal measurement estimation will befurther refined and implemented. Then, the artillery navigator pointing accuracy and ground navigation accuracy will be further enhanced through the integration of multiple aiding sensors. Finally, laboratory test and artillery-based field test will becarried out for system performance verification. In addition to artillery pointing/aiming control and ground navigation, the compact and rugged navigation system developed in this project finds wide applications in the industrial and commercial sector,such as guidance, navigation, and control of small land vehicles, micro robots, autonomous land and underwater vehicles, and other pointing/aiming and positioning applications.",

The primary reason for field and depot level repairs of military equipment iscorrosion.  Metallic weapon systems and their components require extensive corrosion protection to extend service life and prevent operational failures. Current practices consist of polyurethane primers and topcoats for corrosion protection of metallicsurfaces and structural members. These maintenance processes require significant resources (approximately 800 million dollars per year1) for corrosion treatment applications and the related Haz-Mat disposal processes. Under Executive Order 13148, federalagencies are required to reduce the use of selected priority chemicals (including chromium) by 50% by 2006.  Compliance burdens and human health concerns due to exposures are well documented.  By substituting a corrosion inhibiting protective molecularcoating that will resolve corrosion problems while offering new and higher standards for longevity of the coating, simple application techniques for field operations, low environmental impact, and relatively low cost, a significant reduction of theenvironmental compliance burden and total cost of corrosion (including both cost and risk) will be achieved.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project proposes to develop a method to detect Cryptosporidium parvum oocyst in water using a novel sensing coating deposited on filters. C. parvum has been responsible for a number of outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis, including the outbreak in Milwaukee  in 1993 that affected 400,000 people. Crytosporidiosis is characterized by abdominal pain and severe diarrhea, and can be fatal to immune-compromised individuals. Currently, there is no easy and reliable test allowing the routine monitoring of drinking water supplies for C. parvum. The approved EPA method for this purpose is slow, expensive, and requires interpretation by highly trained personnel. The innovation inherent in the proposed pathogen detection platform resides in a unique \"smart\" polymer filter coating that permits pathogen concentration, detection, and signal generation in a single step. The signal is generated from interactions between the target and specific antibodies, resulting in a fluorescent signal. Prior Phase I work has already demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach. The proposed Phase II effort will focus on the optimization of the filter coating and the development of the accompanying hardware and testing protocol needed for commercialization and EPA approval of a complete water-testing product.\n\nThe commercial application of this project is in the market for detection of pathogens in drinking water supplies. The testing market for C. parvum, the specific pathogen targeted in this Phase II project, is estimated to be $75 million in the U.S. and $ 100 million worldwide. It is expected that further adaptations of the pathogen detection technology proposed in this project will have added applications in the markets for the testing of foods and beverages, and in medical diagnostics.",

For structural biology and analytical chemistry NMR has become one of the cornerstones. Increased sensitivity will continue to be a major driver for opening new scientific frontiers for NMR. A key factor in such increases will be higher magnetic field strengths. A magnetic field of 23.5 T, enabling NMR at 1 GHz, has long been a benchmark goal for this field because of the tremendous enhancement in NMR capability it would offer. This Project aims at the development and demonstration of new High Temperature Super-conducting (HTS) YBa2Cu3Ox (YBCO) technology to enable the construction of HTS insert magnets that will generate magnetic fields of 25T in a persistent mode, and enable spectrometers operating at 1066MHz.  \n  \nWhile YBCO has long been known to have potential for use in high fields, the major challenge of YBCO is the development of a production method that ensures adequate electrical and mechanical performance over long lengths at reasonable cost. A coated conductor architecture has emerged as a promising way to fabricate such a conductor. AMSC has concentrated on low cost approaches to make high quality YBCO Coated Conductors. In particular, the combination of deformation-textured substrates (RABiTS) and solution-based deposition processes are being explored and further developed. The Phase I of this Project demonstrated the feasibility of this concept. In the Phase II longer lengths of YBCO Coated Conductors will be manufactured. Suitable joint technology will be developed. The mechanical and electrical performance will be explored in detail, and optimized for use at 25T. The conductor will see extensive testing at high fields, under conditions that will closely simulate high field insert coils.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Chronic renal dysfunction is a progressive, degenerative disorder that ultimately results in acute renal failure and requires dialysis as an intervention, and renal transplantation as the only potential cure. Initiating conditions of renal dysfunction include ischemia, diabetes, underlying cardiovascular disease, or renal toxicity associated with certain chemotherapeutics, antibiotics, and radiocontrast agents. Most end-stage pathological changes include extensive fibrinogenesis, epithelial atrophy, and inflammatory cell infiltration into the kidneys. Scatter factor, also known as hepatocyte growth factor (SF/HGF), is a pleiotropic growth factor that induces the activation and proliferation of diverse cell types, largely through its mitogenic, motogenic, morphogenic, and anti-apoptotic activities. Several recently published studies have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of exogenously administered SF/HGF in the treatment of animal models of toxic, obstructive and ischemic renal disease. The clinical development of protein-based therapies has been hampered by potential immune responses, protein instability, and cost-prohibitive production schemes. We have developed a small molecule mimetic of SF/HGF, called C6, which holds significant potential to overcome these shortfalls. C6 recapitulates many of the bioactivities of SF/HGF, both in vitro and in vivo, by activation of the SF/HGF receptor, c-met. In order to explore further the therapeutic potential of C6 in renal dysfunction, we propose to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of C6 in chronic renal disease secondary to ureteral obstruction, renal ischemia, or heavy metal toxicity; determine the proteomic mechanism of action of the C6 in renal protection and regeneration; and determine the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and toxicity of C6. It is our expectation that C6 will demonstrate efficacy similar to SF/HGF administration in the treatment of obstructive, ischemic and toxic renal injury, and will therefore hold significant clinical potential. These results will be significant, because a small molecule mimetic of the therapeutic effects of SF/HGF activity will eliminate many of the logistical shortcomings of protein-based therapeutics. Successful completion of the proposed studies is expected to provide sufficient data to seek regulatory approval for initiation of clinical trials of C6.",

The basis of this bioassay is expression of a reporter gene from an artificial viral genome present within the cytoplasm of transfected cells.  Significant advances have been made in identifying the cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors involved in replication of many pathogenic negative-strand RNA viruses including RSV.  Negative-strand RNA viruses include some of the most notorious human pathogens and cause significant worldwide morbidity and mortality due to severe respiratory disease and hemorrhagic fever syndromes.  Unfortunately very few therapeutic agents are available to treat infection with these viruses.  Efforts to find new antiviral agents will require methods that are amenable to HTS.  In this application the investigators describe their plans to use novel cell-based assays to identify compounds with anti-RSV activity.  To identify 'hits' that inhibit replication of RSV the applicants plan to screen a unique library of natural compounds and several novel libraries of synthetic compounds.  Apath's partner has developed a proprietary system for making compound libraries from plant-based material.  High abundance compounds that lack drug like properties are removed, and the remaining compounds are chromatographically fractionated into distinct peaks, which are provided to Apath, LLC as arrays in bar-coded 96-well plates.  Synthetic chemical libraries have been obtained from commercial sources that use novel approaches to make diverse compounds from well-conceived scaffolds.  Antiviral activity of all 'hits' will be confirmed in secondary assays to measure inhibition of RSV directly.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The FDA and blood banking societies recognize that bacterial detection to reveal contamination in stored blood products is a direct approach for reducing the problem of post-transfusion bacterial sepsis, and potentially can allow extension of currently approved product storage times. This project involves development of an in situ method (analysis completed within the sealed storage bag) for detecting the presence of likely bacterial contaminants by means of optical analysis at the blood bank or transfusion service immediately prior to release for patient use. Detection is through sensitive fluorescence technologies in which specialized biosensor molecules, immobilized on beads entrapped behind a porous barrier and maintained in continuous contact with the blood product, are interrogated for bacterial presence via non-invasive measurement of fluorescence in a bag-attached detection chamber through a fiber optic probe fluorometer. This methodology is designed to permit permanent association of the detector with the product bag, thereby allowing a real-time estimate of the contamination level in each unit. The project builds upon well established biological (bacteria secrete proteases) and chemical (such proteases are easily detected through \"bead\" techniques) facts, greatly raising probability of success for this unique application. Unique collaborative efforts with Los Alamos National Laboratories plus world-class consultants enhance the strengths of the applicant organization. Three specific aims are proposed for the current effort. First, modifications are being introduced to the detection chamber containing the biosensor beads to improve detection sensitivity and reduce background signal; additionally the fiber optic probe will be altered to accept an annular magnet for improved bead collection prior to measurement. Further tests of bead surface chemistries are proposed to improve bacterial adherence and concentrate them in the detector chamber. Second, the presence of proteases secreted by three types of bacteria known to contaminate platelets will be used as a test system for this method of analysis. This involves relating bacteria levels to secreted protease action which is observed by altered fluorescent properties of bead-bound substrates. The goal is detection of bacteria present in levels of 10(3) per mL or less. Third, the detection capability will be extended to additional protease-secreting bacteria that have been reported as platelet contaminants by analyzing their protease production during growth and by developing substrates more suitable for proteolytic action in this broader array of organisms. A plan for commercialization is well advanced, assuring that successful technical developments will rapidly move toward introduction into the industry.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   \nThe risk from an environmental contaminant is estimated with a risk equation involving the contaminant's concentration and other factors. Because the overall goal of risk management is to ensure such risks are not intolerably large, we need some way to back calculate from constraints on risk mandated by regulation or prudence to the allowable environmental concentration for the contaminant. It is now well known that the approach used in deterministic assessments of simply inverting the risk equation to compute the cleanup goal does not work in a probabilistic assessment. Several approaches have been proposed, but none is sufficiently general. We have developed simple and efficient methods to compute cleanup goals that satisfy multiple simultaneous criteria in the context of a probabilistic assessment. The approach can be used with multiple receptors and with arbitrarily many constraints on percentiles of the target risk. The proposed research will explore the properties of this approach, extend it to more complex problems involving multiple effects (e.g., the toxicant causes two diseases), multiple tropic levels (e.g., plankton to shellfish to humans), multiple exposure pathways (e.g., breathing, drinking, dermal absorption), multiple potentially synergistic toxicants, exposure advisories, and related areas of human health risk assessment. Case studies will be developed for each of these subject areas to demonstrate the workability of the approach and the results disseminated via the scientific literature. User-friendly software will be developed to make these methods available to risk management professionals.",

With the increasing CPU speeds, the focus over the past 15 years has been to develop fast and rigorous simulation tools for composite structures. Evenwith modern computational resources, requirements for modeling large structures overwhelm existing supercomputers. The level of detail in target modeling must be significantly increased since features on the order of a few wavelengths are important for lowRCS calculations. While CEM tools have matured tremendously over the last decade, accurate RCS prediction of realistic ground vehicles at X, Ka and W-bands remains a challenge. Apart from the excessive CPU requirements, there is a need for a practicalintegration of established and modern computational methods to efficiently model materials, composites, and large-scale metallic structures. During Phase I, we proposed a hybrid methodology which forms the basis for a successful integration of theestablished (high frequency and integral methods) and state-of-the-art modern simulation methods along with fast algorithms under a single framework powered through a graphical interface with pre- and post-processing capabilities. Reduced order models forfrequency and angle extrapolations will be also incorporated for generating practical ISAR images.Developed computational tools will be applicable to both radar signature calculations and also for antenna performance predictions. These tools can also beused in the commercial aviation, transportation and security industry. Growing applications also exist in the areas of medical monitoring and imaging.",

The type-II QW photodiodes have comparable quantum efficiency, smaller dark current due to a larger effectivemass, much slower Auger recombination rates, and hence much longer carrier lifetimes.  Through careful bandgapengineering, we have suppressed the Auger coefficient by a factor of >8 for 4.5 -um type-II lasers at 300 K.  In the phase-I program, we havedemonstrated many high-performance photoconductors directly grown on compliant GaAs substrates with a cutoff wavelength from 11 um to 19 um.  We have also demonstrated and dramatically improved the quality of 2-inch compliant GaAs substrates.  With theimprovement of materials growth and compliant substrates, more than a factor of 1500 of improvement has been achieved in the photoresponse.  Further investigations will be performed to optimize the compliant substrates.  Additionally, the coherenttunneling at the mesa-surface is the performance pitfall for ungated SLs mesa devices.  To solve this issue, we propose to develop the surface passivation technology using sulfide materials to eliminate the side-wall leakage current.  Therefore, we will beable to demonstrate large photodiode arrays with a detectivity >5x1012 cmHz 0.5/W at a wavelength of 14, um at 55 K.Critical military needs include missile defense, remote chemical sensing for defense against biological/chemical warfare, and medical.Commercial markets include leak detection, chemical process control, remote chemical sensing for atmospheric pollution and drug monitoring, IR spectroscopy, and medical diagnoses.

In the phase-Iproject, we have demonstrated the first two-color type-II interband-cascade (IC) laser in the world. It shows two lasing wavelengths at 4.482 and 4.568 um. The operation of single frequency mode was maintained with an output power > 8 mW. At 110 K, thedevices demonstrate a peak output power of 150 mW per facet with an average external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 278 percent with a pulse length of 5 psec and a frequency of 1 kHz. The EQE is at least two times better than any Sb-based lasers in the world,and is comparable with the best InGaAs InAlAs type-I QC lasers. In this project. we will further improve the material quality, laser design, processing, and packaging to reduce the leakage current, operating voltage, internal loss, and thermal impedance,and hence to improve the power efficiency and maximum operating temperature. It is expected that with these improvements with good AR HR facet coatings and adequate heat sink, we will be able to deliver packaged two-color type-II QC lasers with a cw outputpower > 10 mW at temperatures > 230 K adequate for many LIDAR and DIAL applications, or with a cw output power> 2 W at low temperature adequate for IR countermeasure and other military applications.

In the Phase II effort, these methods will be optimized, and composite articles willbe generated for test and evaluation.  Promising materials will be delivered to the Air Force for evaluation, and pursued for scale up of production methods.  Materials produced under the program will find application in structural materials (eitherdirectly, or as an enhanced matrix material for use in combination with other fiber reinforced composite technologies) for airframes with dual functionality, such as EMI suppression and lightning strike mitigation.

The OAS utilizes the Game-theoretic Optimal Deformable Zone including Inertia with LocalApproach (GODZILA) algorithms for autonomous path planning which were developed and validated by simulation during Phase I.  Accomplishment of this work exceeded the original Phase I proposed effort and encouraged the proposal of a flight test in Phase II.GODZILA requires no prior knowledge of the geography of the environment, and the algorithm is attractive because it computes a heading command based only on a matrix of scalar sensor measurements.  It is not necessary to accurately reconstruct the size andshape of obstacles in order to avoid them, thus greatly reducing the computational and sensor requirements. Realization of the flight test system is fa-cilitated by use of inexpensive Commercial-Off-The-Shelf components including the aircraft it-self,avionics, sensors and ground station, which are simply plugged together, mitigating sched-ule and technical risk.  A comprehensive integration and test plan is presented which culminates in the UAV negotiating an urban canyon at low altitude whiletransmitting back live video intel-ligence data as a validation of the practicality of the system.GODZILA has wide-ranging applications to the military and private sectors including manned aircraft obstacle avoidance, Spacecraft and UAV collisionavoidance, Underwater Vehicle obstacle avoidance, pipeline and powerline right of way surveillance, Search and Rescue, and agricultural and livestock monitoring.",

Both of these criteria for feasibility have been met.  Three ATA innovations are key to meeting the stringent performance goals ofa state-of-the-art IRU: (1) high-bandwidth, low-noise sensors; (1) an agile, small, symmetric platform; and (3) novel digital algorithms that achieve the requisite active isolation of the IRU from base motion.

The process is called ECONO (Epitaxial Conversion to Oxide via Nitride Oxidation) which is now being considered as the primary contender for the production of buffer layers suitable for the next generation HTS wires.  A leading manufacturer ofHTS products has obtained a non-exclusive license on the ECONO process from ATFI and will work closely in the proposed Phase II effort.  The process involves depositing a high quality yttrium zirconium nitride film which is subsequently converted to yttriastabilized zirconia (YSZ) via a simple oxidation step yielding a high quality epitaxial film.  The main benefit is that it eliminates the need for a seed layer which is difficult and expensive to implement.  In Phase II, ATFI will further develop the ECONOprocess and demonstrate production of YSZ buffer layers in long lengths through continuous processing on non-magnetic textured substrate tapes.   The technical effort will include optimization of chemistry and the conversion process, increasing depositionrate, improving microstructural and epitaxial quality.",

        "abstract": "70860   Current drilling systems (e.g., steerable systems and rotary steerable tools) have limitations when drilling deep wells, particularly in applying high torque to the drill bit.  Hole tortuosity causes steerable systems to generate a high degree of drag; drag also reduces the drill-bit-torque in rotary steerable tools. Other systems (e.g., percussion) develop high vibrations that can damage the accompanying electronic systems.  This project will develop a rotary steerable motor (RSM) system, by combining rotary drilling with mud motors from steerable systems which will deliver high-drill-bit torque and high-drill-bit power for advanced rates of penetration. The RSM system continuously adjusts position as the drill string is rotated, completely eliminating the old practice of \u00bfsliding\u00bf in order to position the hole when motor drilling.  In Phase I, several different RSM concepts were evaluated, and one was selected because it pushes the bit in the preferred direction while the drillstring continues to rotate.  The basic operating parameters of the RSM were determined and a plan was developed for designing and testing field prototypes in Phase II.  In Phase II, laboratory prototypes will be built and tested to demonstrate that they will perform as required.  A prototype system will be designed and two will be built for field tests in wells.      Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The technology should have broad applications in the oil and gas well drilling industries.  Out of an estimated 3400 deviated wells drilled in 2001, less than 750 were drilled using rotary steerable tools.  The rotary steerable motor system should be applicable to all deviated wells, particularly those that are deep and highly deviated.",

It will be applicable to the conceptual design of any complex system that includes human participants. Examples include air and space vehicles, air traffic control, spacemission control, metropolitan emergency management, nuclear power plants, and police command and control units. We believe there is a virtually unlimited market for methods and aids that can support formative design within today's challenging designenvironment.",

        "abstract": "Simulation-based training is a promising instructional approach for training military and civilian first responders.  In addition to training in relevant taskwork skills, there is a need for first responder training in cognitively-based skills such assituation assessment and decision making.  We are addressing this need by the development of FIRST, a validated training program for first responders that uses simulation technology effectively to fill the identified need for targeted training inhigher-level skills such as decision making and situation assessment.  This comprehensive training program will be modular, portable, affordable, can be tailored to simulator availabilities, will target much needed decision-making skills, and can beadministered without an expert trainer or simulation expert. The program will provide detailed scenarios, instructions for administering the program, and measures for performance feedback.  In developing the measures we will draw upon the systematicmeasure-development process pioneered by Aptima for assessing military aviation teams.  Each scenario will exercise a combination of skills and the set of scenarios will span all of the higher-level skills that have been identified as benefiting fromtargeted training.  The Phase II work will culminate in an evaluation of the program in a military setting.  The Phase II product, the First Responder Simulation Training (FIRST) program will train cognitively-based skills for medics in a simulationenvironment. The FIRST program can be targeted to both government and commercial sectors in both a horizontal and a vertical market expansion.  This program will allow regional EMS centers to train their groups in higher level integration skills usingaccessible simulators.  The program could also be offered as part of a comprehensive simulator package that would enable running of the program without the need for an expert trainer.  The validation process we will develop can be used to inform the designof appropriate simulation-based training programs that leverage the strengths of each modality of simulator or training method.The program will demonstrate the importance of well-designed scenarios for increasing the value of simulators in first responder training, and will foster the improved design, growth, acceptance, and adoption of the most effective medical simulatortechnologies.  The far-reaching results will be a reduction of errors and an improvement in patient safety.",

        "abstract": "The focus of this proposal is to develop a leadership training system that facilitates the development and maintenance of high performance in multi-cultural teams.  Specifically, the goal of this effort is to develop a scenario-based assessment andtraining system that can be implemented through a web network or standalone PC - the Functional Learning Levers Team Leader Toolkit (the FuLL TiLT).  For team leaders to effectively intervene to improve performance in a multi-cultural team, they mustunderstand the leverage points for team performance-those team behaviors that are 1) critical for performance and 2) most likely to be adversely affected by diversity.  The FuLL TiLT will prepare leaders to recognize and act on these leverage points.  Thesystem will assess team leader performance in multi-cultural teams, inform the training methods for enhancing that performance, and automatically structure scenario selection for focused, experience-based training to enhance skills and knowledge foroperating within multi-cultural teams.  In this way, the FuLL TiLT will utilize multiple training methods (e.g., written text, vignettes, images, and video-clips) to 1) train the important multi-cultural leader concepts (e.g., what is closed loopcommunication) and 2) give the multi-cultural leader practice and feedback in multi-cultural environments.  Many military, diplomatic, and commercial activities require that people lead teams either 1) composed of people with diverse cultural backgroundsor 2) existing within a different culture.  Specification of the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to perform effectively within these multi-cultural team environments provides a means to structure leader training.  The training system describedin this proposal is intended to provide an integrated method to assess and train multi-cultural team leaders.  Our approach provides team leaders a specific method to build and maintain high performance multi-cultural teams.  This tool will be useful tomilitary and commercial applications that need to train for multi-cultural operations and are dependent on high reliability team performance.",

The program will provide  a completely portable training system that allows teams to increase theirreadiness before and after deployment, whether they are co-located or distributed.  In Phase I, using applicable research on team theory and team training, we developed concepts, methods, and proof-of-concept demonstrations for a web-enabled distributedteamwork skills training program applicable for military emergency medical teams.  The program is comprised of a set of modules, instantiated in a combination of synchronous and asynchronous collaborative technologies, that are linked to teamwork trainingobjectives.  Each module includes a self-contained pre-brief, training exercises, and a debriefing framework that will allow the team to conduct an analysis of their task and teamwork processes without the presence of an instructor.  In Phase II we willcomplete development of the program for Air Force Expeditionary Medical Support (EMEDS) teams, and apply the concepts and materials for civilian medical emergency teams and for other military rapid-response teams.  We will also develop an instructionalguide that team leaders can use for planning and conducting training sessions when participants are not face-to-face.  The value of this work is that it provides a vehicle for geographically distributed teams to develop teamwork and task skills beforebeing deployed to an operational setting.  Because the program is web-enabled, team members can access the training modules from their home station, while en route, or at the deployment location.  It is different from other training programs in that it isa self-contained program that can be used without having an instructor present when the team is training.  The approach that is developed for this program can easily be adapted to any domain in which multifunctional, flexible distributed teams that will becalled upon to respond rapidly and effectively to complex emergency situations will benefit from pre-deployment or on-station or refresher training, including peacekeeping missions, disaster relief, or force protection.",

Leaders must coordinate distributed squads of soldiers in hostile, urban battlegrounds through communication. However, though verbal communications are easy to capture,it traditionally takes days or weeks to analyze and assess this valuable data.  Thus, communications analysis has become the province of research. Communications data are rarely available for use in assessment and training of soldiers.  The AutoCAS PhaseII vision is a system that automates communications analysis through a combination team performance science, voice recognition technology, and automated text classification techniques to provide training and assessment feedback for use in AAR settings toimprove the communication performance of teams of MOUT dismounted soldiers. In our Phase I work, we tested new science and technology that dramatically accelerates communications analyses, making it possible to debrief communications within minutes of thecompletion of a MOUT training scenario.  In Phase II we will develop measures of communications effectiveness and a system to automate the processing of those measures for use in synthetic environment infantry leadership training.  Phase II will culminatewith a demonstration of AutoCAS in support of an infantry MOUT training exercise using the Squad Synthetic Environment at Ft. Benning.  The work we propose to conduct in Phase II benefits soldiers, trainers, ARI, and OSD. MOUT soldiers will receivereliable assessment and informative feedback concerning the quality and content of their verbal communications. AutoCAS will enable MOUT trainers to rapidly and objectively assess communications performance, and to gain insights into the informationmanagement and decision making processes on which mission success depends. ARI Researchers will benefit from AutoCAS because it will lower the cost and increase the speed of coding and analyzing communications data. AutoCAS will make it easier and fasterto test hypotheses, thus accelerating scientific advances. The Office of the Secretary of Defense / Director of Defense Research and Engineering.

Differential capacitance measured at various points about the annulus permit a single MARS to measure accelerations in threedegrees of freedom and rotational velocities in two, missing only the angular velocity about the local z axis. Two MARS systems can be used for full three axis inertial measurements and provide redundancy in all three accelerations and one rotationalvelocity measure.  With built-in processing capability, the MARS system results in an extremely small, low-cost yet robust inertial measurement system. Output of the MARS system will be available in various digital serial formats.The MARS system has been designed to have four modes of operation:  Storage, Start-up, Nominal Operation and Shut-down. To enable reliable use, each mode is operated in a controlled operation enabling the device to handle very large g loads withoutfailure. Sensing rotational rates up to 1000 degrees per second and accelerations up to 15,000 g are anticipated with the device. Due to the differential nature of the device, noise and temperature effects are expected to be minimal when compared toconventional MEMS devices.",

However, one cannot deny the fact that legacy data links such as Link-16 will remain in theinventory for some time.  Weapons systems such as Patriot, THAAD, E-3, etc., all rely on Link-16 to provide common operational pictures of theater air activity.  Furthermore, research continues on extending the capabilities of legacy data links, e.g., theJoint Range Extension initiative.As legacy data links continue to be integrated with emerging technologies, the need increases for management tools that can help visualize the state of a set of interconnected networks.  Such tools do not currently exist, and the point solutions currentlyused to manage legacy networks lack industry-standard, open interfaces to COTS management software.Architecture Technology''s Virtual Network Monitor (VNM) is a set of monitoring agents and a management station that present a unified, run-time view of multiple tactical data links.  VNM agent-manager communication is based on the industry-standardSimple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), thus enabling integration with other SNMP-compliant management tools, such as those that will invariably be developed for future tactical data links and those currently available for COTS networks.Mangement tools are the cornerstone of network-centric interoperabilty. VNM brings management of tactical data links into the mainstream of network-management technology. By building SNMP-compliant interfaces to legacy tactical data links, the cost ofmanagement tools is drastically decreased as a standard interface to a tactical-link monitor is provided.While VNM provides a management station, the information from the VNM agents will be well documented and available for any SNMP manager.  Thus VNM agents can be integrated with any other vendor''s SNMP manager.The target market for VNM tools is clearly military. Link-16 networks deployed by all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces and NATO; as such, the primary customer of VNM technology are Joint Information Control Officers, Dept. of Defense and NATOlaboratories, and vendors of Link-16-based systems.   Applications for these customers range from measuring the benefits of various resource allocation plans, to determining system interoperability by message decoding, to the ability to quantify actualadded value advertised by developers of Link-16 systems and procedural enhancements.With current point solutions for tactical-data-link monitoring costing on the order of $250,000, an order-of-magnitude cost reduction is the price target of the final, Phase III VNM software.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Development is proposed of an x-ray Pixel Array Detector (PAD) consisting approximately of 2,000 x 2,000 pixels to enhance macromolecular crystallographic data collection at synchrotron sources. A PAD consists of an x-ray sensing integrated circuit layer bonded to a pixel electronics layer such that each pixel has its own processing electronics. PADs promise to reduce data collection time by up to a factor of 40 relative to existing detectors while improving data quality. They will have specific capability to:  1) Collect a set of monochromatic data (90 degree rotation) in 18 seconds using the standard oscillation method (0.5 degrees per frame, with exposure time of 100 ms per frame) 2) Collect a set of fine-slice data in 90 seconds with a rotation of 0.05 degrees per frame and with an exposure of 50 ms per frame 3) Collect frames at microsecond exposure time for time-resolved protein Laue diffraction.  Research during Phase I of this proposal was successful in identifying a mixed-mode analog/digital pixel  architecture best suited for the crystallographic application, as well as demonstrating ways of resolving radiation  damage concerns. The input signal is analog integrated onto a capacitor, C(int), by a charge to voltage converter in  the charge integrator stage using a structure very similar to the one in the existing APAD designs. The voltage on the capacitor is constantly compared to an external reference voltage, V(ref), via a voltage comparator in the threshold detector stage. When the integrated voltage level reaches the reference voltage, a bit is generated and  added into an in-pixel digital counter. The threshold detector then also resets the integration capacitor in the charge integrator stage. Thus, each analog cycle of filling C(int) results in an additional digital \"count\" in the high-order  word stored in the in-pixel digital counter.  At the end of the exposure frame, the voltage level remaining on C(int) is digitized, if desired, by an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) at the end of each row of pixels. This digitized value is thus the low-order digital word of the exposure Phase II will involve finalization of the specific pixel  layout, fabrication of suitably large-area integrated circuits, assembly and application testing of a full-scale PAD.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   \nThe major objective of the proposed project is to develop methodology that will allow fast and efficient detection of infectious prion proteins prior to the onset of clinical symptoms. This includes the detection of infectious prions in mortal products, early ante-mortem diagnostic of the prion diseases, and developing experimental approaches allowing delineation of the molecular mechanism of prion and prion-related diseases (folding disorders) in thermodynamic and kinetic terms. Preliminary studies successfully demonstrated that the specific detection of the pathologic prion protein could be approached by simple experimental means. The prion disease process involves a conformational change in the prion protein that in turn can serve as the basis for an early detection, diagnostic, prognostic and screening assay. The assay detects infectivity in a crude sample by identifying existing sub-picomolar levels of infectious prion protein through the use of specific, fluorescent target peptides. The labeled peptides undergo conformational change resulting in an amplified signal in a single step without protease pre-treatment, denaturants or washing. This methodology has three applications: first as a detection assay for infectious prion protein, second as a possible tool for similar diagnostics in other amyloid and/or mis-folded protein diseases; and, lastly as a tool for gaining a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of this group of diseases which can be used to optimize diagnostics and future therapeutics. The structural complexity of the target peptide sequence will be optimized and the thermodynamic and kinetic facets of peptide interaction with the infectious prion protein will be studied thoroughly at the quantitative level to highlight the prominent features that determine species specificity and to generate calibration curves with binding constants for diagnostic development. To further assay improvement, a predictive model will be developed for the conformational diversity of the target peptides used as indicators and surrogates of conformational change upon interaction with the infectious prion protein. The universality of the target peptide concept as a detector for other amyloid diseases will also be evaluated.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this Phase II program we propose continued development of a new nitric oxide (NO) sensor. The sensor is intended for use in assessment of airway inflammation with applications in asthma diagnosis and management as well as in other health care applications involving inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract and the urogenital organs. We use the relatively new Quantum Cascade (QC) distributed feedback semiconductor lasers and flexible hollow waveguides that serve as a light guide and a gas sample cell to produce a tunable Mid-InfraRed semiconductor Laser Absorption Spectrometer (MIRLAS). The QC lasers operate in the mid-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum where NO exhibits a strong band of absorption. We use wavelength modulation spectroscopy to provide measurements that are species specific to assure that measurements are relatively free of interference effects from other constituents of the sample stream. The small sample volumes presented by the hollow waveguide and a proprietary gas exchange assembly provide for rapid response to gas concentration changes. In Phase I, using MIRLAS, we demonstrated a 58.8 ppb NO detection limit with a 0 to 90% rise time of 0.48 s. These measurements are the first of their kind reported in the world. The feasibility of our approach has been clearly demonstrated. The markets for such a device are extensive. The instrument is compact and lightweight and could easily be deployed in physician's offices, health care clinics and emergency rooms. As an indicator of the commercial significance Arete Associates has formed a strategic alliance with Aerocrine AB, a commercial medical device company specializing in airway inflammation diagnosis. Plans for development and marketing are ongoing and evidenced by their participation in this program.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The dementia of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is caused by the buildup in the brain over many years of amyloid. Therefore, the development of a brain scan that measures brain amyloid could identify those individuals at risk for the later development of AD. Early detection can lead to early therapy and delay the onset of symptoms. It is estimated that the delay of the onset of symptoms of AD, for just 5 years, would save $50 billion per year in U.S. health care costs. The number of people who are potential candidates for an AD diagnostic brain scan is in excess of 30 million in United States alone. The goal of this work is the development of an AIzheimer's Disease (AD) diagnostic brain scan. AD is caused by the deposition of amyloid in the brain and a diagnostic brain scan for AD could be developed if amyloid imaging agents were made transportable through the blood brain barrier (BBB). This work will prepare a genetically engineered fusion protein wherein the amyloid-imaging agent is fused to a targeting ligand that undergoes receptor-mediated transport across the BBB in vivo. This BBB transport vector has been genetically engineered to enable use in humans without immunological reaction. The fusion protein will be a bi-functional molecule that not only crosses the BBB, but also binds to the amyloid plaques of AD brain in vivo, and contains a chelator moiety for radiolabeling. In phase I, the fusion gene was engineered, cell lines were produced, and the bi-funtionality of the fusion protein was demonstrated--the fusion protein both binds the BBB receptor and binds the AD amyloid. The phase II work will produce a cell line secreting the fusion protein, and the production of this protein will be scaled up for manufacturing. Following the validation of the fusion protein, the pharmacology/toxicology and IND preparation will be performed during the 03 year. The completion of the phase II work will enable the preparation of an IND to the FDA for testing of this novel in vivo brain scan that will be the first diagnostic test specific for AD. The AD brain scan may allow for the early detection of those individuals at risk for later development of brain amyloid and AD, and allow for early drug therapy.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   \nManipulation of objects on a microscopic scale can be done conveniently with a device known as a laser or optical tweezers. While laser trapping was originally devised for trapping Rayleigh particles (i.e. particles much less than the wavelength of the incident light) it's ability to manipulate biological particles such as macromolecules, viruses, microtubules and chromosomes offers great practical potential. In addition a laser tweezers can be used to fabricate small-scale devices such as microscale motors, pumps and switches.  Many systems of interest require multiple optical traps and several methods have been developed to achieve multiple trap configurations. However currently available trapping systems can produce at most only a few independent traps. Recently, Grier and Dufresne conceived of a new solution for achieving a multi-trap system. In their method a hologram is used to alter a single laser beam's wave front. The wave front is altered so that the downstream laser beam forms a large number of individual laser beams with relative positions and directions of travel fixed by the exact nature of the hologram. The hologram can be calculated from a user specified pattern of desired trap positions.  During the Phase I work we have successfully developed a commercial prototype of a holographic optical tweezers, which is capable of deploying up to 200 independent laser traps. As part of this work we have designed an easy to use laser tweezers with an imaging system, computer interface, sample chamber, and optical system. Field-testing at the Whitehead Institute and the University of Maryland has resulted in those institutions initiating purchase negotiations (the University of Maryland has purchased an instrument). In addition field-testing programs at the University of Chicago, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and Drexel University are being negotiated.   \n  \nWe now propose to make the holographic optical tweezers a commercial product by developing manufacturing standards for components and incorporating a greater variety of imaging modalities. We will also develop methodology to facilitate use of existing applications of laser trapping in a user friendly way.",

        "abstract": "In the 2002 Small Business Innovation Research Solicitation, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency explicitly expressed interest in instruments that can accurately and reliably measure particulate emissions from vehicles.  The availability of suitable instruments for measuring particulate emissions from engines and vehicles will benefit two broad categories of users:  (1) it will directly help in the development of low emission engines, and (2) it will allow the appropriate government agencies to establish roadside checkpoints for monitoring the particulate emissions from vehicles and take enforcement actions against violators of environmental regulations.  \n\nLaser-induced incandescence (LII) has emerged as a technique for measuring soot concentration and size (it appears that non-soot matter is evaporated and/or does not contribute to the signal).  In the Phase I proposal, Artium Technologies, Inc., introduced a novel LII method for precisely determining the primary particle size and the number density of primary particles, in addition to particulate concentration in diesel exhausts.  The proposed LII technique is capable of real-time particulate matter (PM) measurements over any engine transient operation.  LII also has orders of magnitude more sensitivity than the gravimetric technique.  The wide dynamic range and lower detection limit of LII make this technique a potentially preferred standard instrument for PM measurements.  The Phase I effort clearly demonstrated the capabilities of the LII technique.  The Phase I effort established the feasibility of building an instrument using this technique, and the proposed Phase II effort will further develop the technique and instrument as well as verify its suitability for PM measurement in a variety of applications.  The Phase II Option effort will focus on cost reduction leading to the development of a roadside monitor as well as a portable version of the LII instrument.",

        "abstract": "The Phase II basic effort seeks to develop and test a prototype PDI cloud probe for reliable and accurate measurement of the cloud droplet size distribution from airborne platforms. The key features of this device are high accuracy and precision of dropletsizing, large dynamic range, accurate concentration measurement throughout the entire instrument dynamic range, very low coincidence errors, and large counting volume. The other key features of the instrument are: low cost, low power consumption,compactness, and real-time data monitoring and transmission to ground-based facilities. As an option, we propose to investigate and incorporate a means for discriminating ice-crystals from water droplets. As another option, we have proposed the developmentof an airborne imaging cloud probe to complement the PDI cloud probe. This will permit measurement of both spherical and non-spherical particles. Finally, as a third option, we have proposed to participate actively with the CIRPAS personnel in the flighttesting of these probes. This instrument package represents a significant improvement over past cloud droplet measurement devices, and thereby directly addresses the need for atmospheric instruments/sensors that the Navy has identified in topic N02-61 ofthe FY2002 SBIR solicitation.  Clouds are a very important component of the climate system because of their effects on longwave and shortwave radiation, atmospheric heat, moisture, and mass transport, precipitation, and atmospheric chemistry. Clouds andfeedback mechanisms associated with them are widely acknowledged as one of the key uncertainties in understanding climate and future climate prediction. A thorough understanding of clouds is also critical for weather prediction. Quantitative precipitationforecasting is one of the primary focus areas for the US Weather Research Program. The development of a suitable cloud probe will therefore have immense scientific value. Besides clouds, there are wide ranges of applications for an instrument that cancharacterize sprays and droplet fields over a wide size range. The immediate goal of producing a probe for measuring icing clouds and other cloud drop size distributions has a limited but adequate market potential. The obsolescence of the PMS probes hasleft a market opportunity for new probes based on advanced technology. There are also signficant applications requiring an imaging probe for process evaluation and control. For example, in spray drying, the usual light scattering methods fail because thedrops are not transparent or homogeneous. In such cases, an imaging system is the best method to use since it is not affected by the peculiarities of the droplet material. Another area deals with research in fire suppression systems used in commercialbuildings. A system is needed to characterize sprays from fire suppression sprinklers and to help develop these systems. No system exists for these applications whereas the number of spray drying processes including food processing, drug manufacturing,andother industrial processes is enormous. One of the complaints about the PDI method is that it cannot cover the entire drop size range in many sprays and that the larger nonspherical drops can produce significant error.",

Once fully developed, the tracker will overcome performance and applicability limits caused by bulky, obstructive emitters and lens-based cameras that interfere with human motion, cockpit layout, andingress/egress.

The SHD improvements over current technology that make it intrinsically safer and simpler are pressure-actuated bloodpumping, single- or dual-needle access, sorbent saturation monitor, and automated fluid management. The WDS makes further improvements by reducing total dialysate volume to about 2 liters, improving volumetric UF control, and adding variable bicarbonatebuffering. Ordinary potable water may be used for dialysate; it will be purified by the system before use. The equipment will be made more rugged and hazard resistant for military field applications.

Because analytical results play a larger role in the design of such systems than in the past, it is necessary to havesoftware that provides better answers.A new flow analysis tool concept will be developed, that is both a design tool and an assessment tool. It will provide Air Force designers with the ability to design combined cycle engine flow paths, as well as give them the ability to assess designssubmitted by contractors. It will be based on the idea of portable parametric parts, so that designs can be worked between labs.

An innovative design concept was developed for this purpose in Phase I of the program. Thisdesign consists of a graphite epoxy/honeycomb core laminate formed into an essentially flat disk. A single primary payload would be attached directly to the disk whereas a pedestal is required for the use of multiple secondary payloads. The design of thedisk is tuned so that the modal frequencies of the system achieve a high level of payload vibration isolation. This innovation reduces cost and part count and greatly facilitates the manufacturing process while meeting challenging structural requirementswithout resorting to unproven and difficult-to-obtain materials. The design also uses constrained layer damping to reduce vibration levels during the sine-sweep testing that would simulate the severe resonant burn condition of the PeaceKeeper rocketstages. A full-scale engineering design unit will be manufactured and tested exhaustively to confirm adequate static and dynamic strength performance as well as demonstrate the superior isolation characteristics being provided for sensitive and fragilepayloads.",

In addition, a comprehensive drop test study will be to provide a detailed map of the system's performance regarding payload weights. Drag and balance of practical cargo within thesystem's weight range will be analyzed and collected data used to generate a user manual of operational limits and rigging guidelines for objects being dropped with the ONYX System. Autonomous fleets of deployable high altitude precision aerial deliverysystems are of indispensable value to the military. Essential strategic value lies in military supply efforts. Due to the proliferation of low cost surface to air missiles, high altitude airdrop techniques greatly reduce aircraft and ground troopvulnerability. Such capabilities are also needed for the quick and efficient distribution of humanitarian aid and disaster relief. Specialized commercial delivery is an additional commercial application for these systems. Possible uses include the abilityto land and recover equipment used in stratospheric launches.

        "abstract": "Sophisticated attacks on computer systems typically proceed in stages. The attacker first probes the target site to discover its vulnerabilities, and then exploits the vulnerabilities. To avoid detection, attacks can be spread out over time or be launchedfrom multiple hosts. An attacker who has gained entry to a network host can use it as a base from which to attack other hosts on the network. Current techniques cannot reliably recognize successive stages of a coordinated attack.  ATC-NY proposes to buildASTER (Active Smart Targets for Effective Response), a system to identify attackers by feeding them traceable information during exploratory probes. When attackers use the information in later attack stages, ASTER can correlate the stages and assess theattack.  In Phase I, ATC-NY successfully demonstrated the feasibility of ASTER with an initial prototype.

To do this, a novel protein expression technology, called Random Activation of Gene Expression (RAGE), will be used. RAGE libraries produced using genomic libraries carried in bacterial artificial chromosomes offer a number of advantages over conventional expression methodologies, including high-level expression without the need for full-length cDNAs. RAGE libraries produced in BAC libraries should allow the majority of secreted factors to be expressed and interrogated in the proposed research program. In addition to potential direct medical and therapeutic benefits, the discovery of new proteins with activities in promoting cell survival and division has considerable benefits on biological research in general. Even the limited number of growth factors available has provided a central foundation for the nascent field of stem cell biology in the CNS. Identifying proteins that further enable regulation of these populations will provide tools that may greatly extend our ability to achieve such important goals as repair of CNS damage.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of the research project is to further develop the dual hybridization diagnostic genotyping method into a multiplex assay capable of using unlabeled, unamplified DNA as the target. The feasibility of the dual hybridization method was demonstrated in Phase I using amplified targets and single fluorophore labels. All results indicate that the method will transfer easily to a parallel, high sensitivity method using sheared genomic DNA and fluorescent microsphere labels. Current genetic diagnostic tests are expensive and usually only performed for a few specific mutations after adverse symptoms have occurred. The simplicity of this diagnostic test will remove the cost limitation, which currently exists for obtaining large amounts of genetic information, allowing routine diagnostics to be preventative medicine. Particular improvements include: 1) shorter manipulation time and less difficulty performing the procedure (no PCR, sample labeling, or multiple aliquoting is required), 2) reduction of patient sampling (blood, tissue, etc.), and 3) parallel genotyping of SNPs and larger mutations. The method uses a dual hybridization of target molecules. One hybridization event occurs between targeted fragments in the genomic DNA sample and long DNA probes immobilized in an array. The result of this hybridization is a sequence-specific immobilization of target nucleic acids. For example, all alleles of a gene would be localized to one array site. The other hybridization event occurs between the target nucleic acid and short probes of peptide nucleic acid (PNA, a nucleic acid analog) that form stable, highly sequence-specific hybrids with DNA. Each allelic variant has its own PNA probe with a unique label. The types of labels detected at the probe site indicate the alleles present in the patient's genome. This procedure is highly flexible since almost any label can be used. Pooled labeled PNA probes, DNA probe arrays, and possibly buffers and an automated flow cell (capable of maintaining correct temperature and liquid handling) will be sold to the consumer. For Phase II, an array for genotyping SNPs suspected of influencing susceptibility to colon cancer will be designed. This research tool and other custom arrays can be sold for research use until the method can be approved by the FDA for diagnostic use. A major research market for the device would be determining SNP patterns for diseases where massively parallel SNP genotyping must be performed on thousands of patients for each disease.",

The top ten problems facing the industry are: (1) A declining access to timberlands in some areas, (2) Higher saw log costs, (3) Lower saw log quality, (4) Greater residue disposal problems, (5) Fluctuating lumber pricing, (6) Increasing pressure to operate in a less environmentally harmful manner, (7) Encroaching global competition, (8) Competition from substitute materials, (9) Growing demand for environmentally responsible wood products, and (10) Growing reputation of being an environmentally unfriendly industry. Since most sawmills are located in rural communities, many current and future jobs, along with viable local economies will decline if local sawmills continue to reduce their labor force or close. Since August 2001 over 24 sawmills and secondary wood products companies have closed in Maine and nationally the number is much higher. This project will assist the forest products industry to develop concrete solutions which will help make sawmills more efficient by maximizing their raw material resources.

The results of the Phase I effort have shown that new honeycomb-core materials and adhesives are commercially available that have significantly better corrosion resistance than the original materials. The Phase II program will build on andexpand those results to yield specifications and production capability for improved lifetime honeycomb-core structures for legacy naval aircraft such as the F-14. Upon completion of the Phase II program, Aurora Flight Sciences Corp. will be positioned forfull production of fully qualified honeycomb-core replacement parts for military and commercial aircraft. 1.New honeycomb-core materials and adhesives will be identified and qualified that can be used to construct honeycomb-core sandwich structures thathave an extended typical service life of 60 months or greater under at sea conditions (compared to 30 months for the current structures). These materials will be fully qualified through rigorous coupon-level testing and full component fabrication andtesting. Final fabrication procedures and materials will be fully documented under Aurora's ISO 9002 certification.2. Production methods and capabilities will be developed that will enable Aurora Flight Sciences to supply improved performance replacement honeycomb-core sandwich structure parts for Naval and commercial aircraft. Production of replacement parts will bepossible even if complete design specifications are not available",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   \nThe objective of this project is to develop a commercial software product to improve the visualization and resolution of two-dimensional (2D) images obtained from optical microscopes. Diffraction and other optical distortions present in every 2D microscope image are characterized by the point-spread-function (PSF) of the system, but this information is rarely known accurately. Iterative blind deconvolution is a method that enables the PSF to be estimated directly from the blurred and noisy image. The system developed can derive all necessary information from the image itself, and requires no additional parameters about the microscope setup, as is currently the case for 3D deconvolution. The algorithm developed is automated, can reconstruct spatial frequency components beyond the diffraction limit, and is robust to noise contamination. Intensity quantification is retained for certain classes of images.  \n  \nRestoration of low-light level live-cell time-lapse imagery is an important application area. In confocal microscopy, signal intensity can be increased at the expense of a loss in spatial resolution, which can be compensated for using the 2D blind deconvolution. This then enables light exposure to be reduced, thus keeping cells healthier for longer. Other application areas include widefield fluorescence, differential interference contrast, total internal reflection fluorescence, and spinning disk confocal microscopy. Restoration is fast enough to be carried out online.  \n  \nThe Phase II objectives are to commercialize the current algorithm developed, improve the automation, increase the robustness against noise, and further reduce processing times. The potential market is significantly larger than that for current 3D deconvolution software. Imagery from almost every microscope \"could benefit because no specialized equipment is required and a diffraction limit is always present.",

Avtec is currently involved in the development of these Link-16 applications.Avtec will develop the dynamic networking process, signaling, and messages to support the proposed applications.  We will identify the Initial Network configurations most likely deployed and develop a possible Network Configuration option pool for theseapplications.  The signaling and messaging for the network reconfiguration, and the selection and training of a neural net based Automated Network System (ANS) will be the two primary technical tasks of Phase II.Avtec will define Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) for Dynamic Networking benchmarking purposes.  QoS performance factors such as reallocation delay, network integrity, reliability, messaging overhead, and impact on remaining network will be considered.A Proof of Concept (POC) laboratory demonstration utilizing PC hosts and Link 16 terminals will be designed and developed.  Optionally, Avtec will perform a series of QoS tests on the POC hardware with the MOEs for evaluation. The improved bandwidth utilization for temporary high bandwidth signaling will potentially support a number of applications such as: Organic Navigation for precise munitions guidance in GPS denied target areas, Advanced Tactical Targeting Technologiesthat support multiplatform sensor integration for the geolocation of threat emitters, Mission profile updating such as envisioned for the Weapons Systems Open Architecture (WSOA), and Precision Munitions target updates for Time Sensitive targets which mayhave moved since being launched.Another application area may be in multimedia distribution over Link 16.  There have already been demonstrations of sensor imaging being transmitted over Link 16 using enhanced throughput modes.  Other applications may involve downloading recent images ofa target area to the strike force.  This is a proposed feature of WSOA, which utilizes CORBA over Link 16 to support updating Time Critical mission data, and asset retasking with recently identified high priority targets.   The capability of dynamicallyallocating resources could provide the mechanism necessary to make these applications viable in the field.  These applications also support the Net Centric warfare concept where increasing amounts of information and data get distributed across a variety ofnetworks to enhance the warfighter's situational awareness.",

The product will have three components:  1) a didactic portion to update oncology physicians on the rationale to offer sperm-banking to all men of reproductive age; 2) a skills-training portion teaching physicians how to counsel patients and families about sperm banking; and 3) a direct patient education portion including both didactic and emotion-focused material for men and their family members.  We intend to demonstrate, over the three phases of the project that sperm banking is currently underutilized, even in the highest quality patient care centers; that both oncology physicians and patients lack the knowledge to make fully informed decisions about sperm banking; and that our educational product can increase knowledge in patients and physicians, increase their positive attitudes towards banking sperm, and actually affect the rates of sperm banking in two large cancer centers.  In the R25 Phase of the project, we will collect baseline data on physician knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding sperm banking by a postal survey of 230 oncology faculty physicians and fellows from the U.T. M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) and the Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF).  We plan to assess deficits in physician knowledge and practice that contribute to patients= failures to successfully bank sperm.  We will also send questionnaires to 1,000 men aged 14 to 40 who were diagnosed and treated for cancer within the last two years of the tumor registries at MDACC and CCF.  We will assess rates of sperm banking, barriers to sperm banking, knowledge about infertility and cancer, and anxieties and attitudes about parenthood after cancer, providing benchmark data for comparison to that gathered in our later interventions.  We will also conduct 8 focus groups to gather qualitative data on familial, cultural, and spiritual issues regarding sperm banking.  Information from the survey and focus groups will be used to complete a written script of the content for the interactive media product.

        "abstract": "Conventional medium caliber projectiles fall short of desired effectiveness due to factors such as aiming inaccuracy, component manufacturing tolerances, wind effects, etc.  A guided projectile that could obviate these factors would substantially improvehit probability, increasing effective range and lethality. Commensurately longer standoff distances also increase warfighter survivability. Further, increased lethality of smaller caliber weapons may reduce reliance on larger caliber (less mobile)munitions, contributing to greater force mobility.Our Phase I program resulted in a conceptual design for a medium caliber gun launched guided projectile and its transceiver, aimed at addressing these needs. Our approach exploits recent advances in 'smart' material development to provide an innovativeflight control mechanism driven through a very simple communications link to its transceiver, in a low cost and rugged configuration.  In Phase II, we will refine our design for compatibility with desired maneuverability and gun launch and flight loads,build prototype projectiles, and demonstrate their performance in a progressive series of tests, culminating in flight demonstration of projectile maneuver capability at extended range. While the Phase II design is based on the Bofors 40mm L70 HEIT round,our concept readily scales to the full range of interest (12mm to 40mm).",

        "abstract": "Sandwich core structures represent a lightweight and structurally efficient approach for composite airframe fabrication. However, the use of sandwich core structures has also presented challenges, particularly in high humidity environments. In theseenvironments, any defect or damage to the sandwich facesheets allows moisture intrusion into the cells of the honeycomb. A simple approach to address moisture intrusion of conventional honeycomb materials would be to use closed-cell foam, however, thestrength properties of foam cores is limited at best. Aztex has developed a technology that utilizes lightweight, closed cell foam as a base. The foam is reinforced with very small diameter pultruded rods (typically carbon fiber/BMI or epoxy). The rods areused to create a truss network in the foam. This approach can be tailored to the specific applications. Shear and compression strengths can be adjusted as required (locally if necessary) to achieve the desired combination of core weight versus mechanicalproperties. The purpose of this program will be to develop preliminary design allowables and fabricate and test manufacturing demonstration hardware. We have discussed this program with Lockheed Martin Aerospace (Fort Worth, TX) who have agreed to supportthis Phase II program for application in the F-35 MLG doors. Aztex X-Cor and K-Cor technology represents a completely new class of core materials. These materials can be produced as completed parts, ready for incorporation into the structure without theadditional machining, potting and edge filling steps required with conventional honeycomb. X-Cor and K-Cor also can be designed with shear and compression strengths significantly greater than foam cores. Successful completion of this program will providepreliminary design allowables data for X-Cor/K-Cor and strcutural demonstration components as a first step for incorporation of these materials on F-35/JSF. These materials have essentially unlimited applications on DoD and commerical aerospace platforms,commerical aircraft, ground transportation, military shelters, etc. X-Cor and K-Cor can be used in any application where conventional core materials could be used, but without the moisture intrusion issues of honeycomb or the strength limitations of foamcores.",

The attachments and hot tap will be made using the friction stud welding non-fusion joining process.  This project provides an interface between anunderwater friction stud welding system and an atmospheric diving system (ADS).  The fixtures and tooling developed can also be used by a remote operating vehicle (ROV). The proposed Phase II effort will include 9 separate tasks: Improvement of WeldingSystem, Impact on Submarine Hull Structure, Design and Manufacture of Interface and Fittings and Procurement of Supplies, Conduct of Tank Testing, Planning for Demonstration, Conduct of Deep Water Testing , Development of Phase III Plan, Development ofPhase II Report, and Project Management  The proposed project will be performed by an integrated project team from B&B Engineering and Oceaneering International, Inc. The Phase II effort will provide a foundation for commercialization in Phase III andbeyond.  The Phase I effort will show the feasibility of the use of friction stud welds, and will provide a test plan for demonstrating their use in Phase II.  The technology has possible applications in underwater welding beyond the attachment of studsand providing for hot taps.  For example, friction stir welding is being evaluated for repair of cracks in structure.  The technology developed in this project will enable such repairs to be conducted at greater depths. This process has tremendouscommercial potential for application to offshore oil platform repairs that currently require saturation diving and dry chamber welding to effect.  For Phase III, B&B Engineering will solicit oil companies to participate in an actual repair or operationthat would involve friction stud welding using an ADS system.  If the SBIR program would be willing to match 25 percent of the funding needed for such operations, oil companies would be quick to match the other 75 percent for a project that was importantto them.  Placement of anodes on an offshore structure would be one such application.  Performing a bolted on clamp repair would be another example.

        "abstract": "70616S02-II     Of the handful of telerobotic masters available, few provide force feedback to the user. This lack of feedback significantly reduces effectiveness in the complex and cluttered remote-work environments typical of DOE Environmental Management (EM) activities.  In addition, these masters tend to be cumbersome, fatiguing, and non-intuitive; and none has provisions for controlling multi-fingered end effectors.  This project will develop a telerobotic master device with full 6-axis force-reflection and control of slave-hand grasping forces, to create a highly functional control station with advanced computer-generated virtual-force guidance.  The system will be lightweight, comfortably intuitive to operate, and universal to DOE slave manipulators in EM operations.  In Phase I, a systems design for a full turn-key, universal, force-reflecting telerobotic workstation was completed.  Engineering calculations were performed and hardware prototypes were constructed for a 4-amp-continuous, vector-based, brushless motor controller, which is 10 times smaller than the best commercially available brushless-DC motor controller, and is deployed along a bus.  Phase II will complete the development of the full turn-key system, with all software and hardware integrated into a single shipable station.  The system will be built and realistic EM tasks of increasing complexity will be used as a basis for laboratory experiments to demonstrate effectiveness.      Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The force-reflecting master controller should meet DOE requirements for teleoperation.  Immediate applications should include homeland security inspection/response, military explosive ordnance disposal, delicate surgery, and rehabilitation for spinal injury and stroke victims.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   \nFalls are a leading cause of disability and even death in the elderly. A method is needed by which to identify elderly persons who frequently experience falls or near falls (e.g., slips, stumbles, etc.). There are presently no tools to objectively record such events and their characteristics (e.g., kinematics) in independent-living, assisted-living, or nursing-home environments. A device that could be used to discreetly count fall frequency and record the characteristics of fall events - while still permitting free and unrestricted body movement - would be invaluable in understanding why elderly people fall. Such a device could also serve as a research tool, enabling a better understanding of risk factors associated with falls and near falls. A method for characterizing fall dynamics (e.g., impact velocity and orientation, fall direction, impact energy) would assist in identifying elderly persons at high risk for hip fracture. Hip fractures, for example, have been associated with high impact energy sideways falls in which the subject lands on their hip.  \n  \nUnder the proposed Phase II SBIR effort, Barron Associates, Inc. and its subcontractors, the University of Kansas Center for Research and the University of Virginia Division of General Medicine, Geriatrics & Palliative Care, propose to develop and demonstrate the Wear And Forget Ambulatory Recorder for Elderly Residents (WAFARER), a wireless system to detect, archive, characterize, and \"reconstruct,\" through PC-based graphical reenactment, fall and near-fall events in the elderly with the goals of understanding and preventing fall-related injuries and their sequelae. Three-dimensional animation of pelvic motions during fall and near-fall events will facilitate their interpretation by senior-care facility physicians, nurses, and others.",

The system will use low-profile, low-power, Remote Sensor Units (RSUs) worn by the subject to pre-process, digitize, temporarily store, and transmit surface EMG data to a System Interface Unit (SIU) receiver for real-time display and archiving on a base station PC. Additional features of the proposed system include: (1) extremely small size, (2) simultaneous 16-channel data collection, (synchronized to within one microsecond across channels), (3) high-speed sampling (2 kHz per channel), (4) both digital and analog outputs at the SIU, and (5) high-speed (Universal Serial Bus) interface between SIU and base station PC. The system offers the following advantages over existing, commercially-available  surface EMG data acquisition systems: (1) lower cost, (2) completely wireless operation, permitting free and unrestricted subject movement, (3) reduced \"noise,\" since signal motion artifact associated with wires is eliminated and because the EMG signal is conditioned and digitized at the electrode site (active electrode), (4) potential for reducing physiological cross-talk (with use of double-differential electrode configuration), and (5) greater portability, since the RSUs are just slightly larger than the required spacing between electrode contacts.",

This deficiency can adversely effect job performance and make it more difficult to distinguish traffic signal lights. Using the same color correction model developed in our Phase I grant we will construct cone sensitivity functions from the recently identified gene sequences responsible for the color cone pigment shifts. From the shifted cones we can use the mathematical model we developed during the phase I grant to derive anomalous color matching functions and then map any color stimuli as seen by the color deficient into a normal standard color space. Additionally we can use our model to develop color corrective filters tailored to the individual cone pigment shifts. We have identified 10 sets of filters that will color correct for 21 cone pigment shifts associated with anomalous deutans and protans. We will design and melt billets of the glass required for this study, and fabricate them into color-corrective eyewear. The color discrimination of 100 test subject will be studied at 2 test sites.  \nNeutral density filters of the same luminance will act as controls. This set of 10 filters is unlike other  corrective filters used for treating color deficiency. They are designed to correct the hue and saturation of colors for deuteranomolous and protanomolous individuals. We will identify 100 test subjects using the American Optical Company Hardy, Rand and Ritter (AO HRR) pseudoisochromatic plate test, and then from the Nagel Anomoloscope testing determine the probable wavelength shifts of the L and M cones responsible for the color deficiency. In this way we will select which of the 10 color corrective eyewear are most suited to each test subject. Each test subject will be tested using the desaturated D-15 cap tests, Farnsworth Munsell 100 Hue (FM-100) test, and Lanthony's desaturated cap test, the Famsworth Lantern test as well as the Dvorine Color Matching Wheel, with and without the color-corrective eyewear.

During Phase I, BCR has demonstrated the feasibility of adapting its technology to developing a low-cost biosensor for detecting bacteria in platelet concentrates shortly before transfusions. BCR's biosensor is based on the LEXSAS (Label-free Exponential Signal-Amplification System), a unique methodology using spores as ultrasensitive nanodetectors capable of emitting fluorescent light signals when encountering single bacterial cells.  \n  \nFor Phase II, BCR proposes: 1. To construct a marketable biosensor prototype that will extend the system's sensitivity to single bacterial cells. 2. To use the prototype for a study designed to obtain experimental data that will meet the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements for premarket approval of the biosensor.  \n  \nThe study will consist of three major tasks: 1. To test, optimize, and standardize the biosensor prototype in terms of sensitivity, completion time, analysis reproducibility, and dynamic range. 2. To use the prototype for experiments designed to obtain a \"Data Package\" to be submitted to the FDA. This task includes experiments that will show the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of the biosensor for identifying platelet concentrates spiked with a panel of about 13 different bacterial strains from a list provided by the FDA. 3.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Unnatural amino acids (UAAs) are increasingly becoming important pharmaceutical intermediates, with applications in a number of current and future drugs. Since UAAs are almost always required as pure stereoisomers, a chiral synthesis is preferred over the resolution methods that are most commonly employed. In Phase I the single-pot deracemization process to make the L-enantiomer was demonstrated. In this method the D-enantiomer of a D,L-amino acid mixture is selectively oxidized to the corresponding 2- ketoacid using a D-amino acid oxidase. The 2-ketoacid is then stereoselectively aminated to the L-amino acid by an L-amino acid transaminase or an L-amino acid dehydrogenase. This is accomplished in a reaction single step, intermediates need not be isolated nor is it necessary for protecting groups or derivatization. Yields and enantiomeric excess values approach 100 percent. This method has a broad scope and will be applicable to a wide range of UAA products. Directed evolution was used on a number of the enzymes investigated to create more active enzyme mutants. In Phase II the deracemization process will be further characterized and optimized. Directed evolution will be performed on a number of the enzymes to create mutants with enhanced activity and broader substrate specificity. In addition, the deracemization of amino acids to make the pure D-enantiomer will be investigated. Both methods, for making the pure L- or D-enantiomer will be demonstrated on the 100 gram scale for important commercial targets.",

The tools will improve the reliability of current virtual screening methods by taking advantage of all available information on a protein target's family, including aligned sequences, available structures, co-crystalized ligands, and active compounds described in the literature. The tools will also specifically allow common regions of family active sites to be targeted in the design of family-focused combinatorial libraries with high activity rates against any member of the family. Lastly the tools will allow unique regions of the target active site to guide the design of compounds with high selectivity for a specific target. A key component of this suite of tools is a novel description of the interaction of a ligand with the surface of a protein called a footprint. Footprints are used as input to clustering, filtering, and learning methods to analyze the results of docking screens and to compare docking results across members of the target family. Virtual screening of large libraries of chemical compounds will be performed on four protein families, the data analyzed, and new promising scaffolds for future focused combinatorial libraries will be detected.  \nIn summary the successful development and application of the tools described in this grant request can:  \n1. Significantly increase the success rate of virtual screens;  \n2. Generate highly effective focused combinatorial libraries to protein families;  \n3. Generate target-specific leads in difficult target families such as kinases;  \n4. Guide the construction of highly focused in-vitro experimental screening.",

BioCrystal further developed a novel surface chemistry that provides protection, stabilization (against oxidation,ionic strength and buffers), aqueous solubility in a wide range of pHs, functionalization and linking ability, and dramatic fluorescence enhancement (brightness).In Phase II BioCrystal will develop and successfully demonstrate a prototype automated continuous flow process system for industrial-scale production of high quality, functionalized semiconductor nanocrystals with narrow size distribution.

These nanocrystals will be directly conjugated to a variety ofbioreceptors (i.e., antibodies, avidin, nucleic acids, and lectins)that are commonly used in biological detection and diagnostics. These conjugated nanocrystals will be fully characterized and favorably compared in selected fluorescence-based assays withconjugates of organic fluorophores commonly used today.The Phase II effort will demonstrate BioCrystal's capability of producing industrial-scale levels of high quality, monodisperse, functionalized fluorescent semiconductor nanocrystals for broadindustrial applications in research and diagnostics. This effort will further demonstrate the efficacy of these functionalized nanocrystals for use in the following: nucleic acid diagnostics; DNA and antibody microarrays; immunohistochemistry; qualitativedisease detection schemes; for bio-agent detection, in either air-borne or in aqueous environments; in the many different fluorescence-based assays used for research in the life sciences and clinical medicine; and for non-medical applications inidentification and authentification.Upon successful demonstration of this industrial-scale production prototype system, BioCrystal will confirm its ability to adequately address market demand for fluorescent nanocrystals in the multi-billion dollar fluorescence-based bioreagent marketplace,either directly or through large, well-entrenched bioreagent company partners.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Suture anchors provide a quick, secure, and simple means of surgically attaching soft tissue to bone. Since their introduction in 1985, suture anchors have been widely used in a variety of surgical procedures. They provide a significant savings in time and cost to both surgeon and patient. However, there are a number of shortcomings with current anchors. Existing suture anchors perform poorly in osteoporotic bone and cannot be repositioned easily following implantation. The issue of attachment to osteoporotic bone will become increasingly important with a growing active adult population.   We propose the development of a novel, new suture anchor technology that possesses the same benefits of existing devices but yields significant advantages. The new anchor is less invasive, can be readily repositioned, provides exceptional performance in poor quality bone, and can be used as a revision device for other anchors.   Based on the Phase I confirmation of feasibility, the goal of the Phase II work is the specific product development of the rotator cuff repair anchor, followed by design modification for a diverse product line of anchor products. Rotator cuff repair is a high volume surgical operation that often involves poor quality bone in the proximal humerus where standard anchor devices do not provide adequate fixation strength. The development of this anchor and associated insertion tooling will utilize a finite element analysis design tool. A thorough bench testing regimen will be performed to establish regulatory equivalence to a commercial predicate device, with a special focus on fixation strength in an osteoporotic bone model. A group of shoulder specialists will assess the utility of the anchor system by performing simulated cuff repairs in a cadaveric model. Rotator cuff reconstructions using the prototype systems and current devices will also be tested in a dynamic shoulder testing system to evaluate the cyclic failure risk of early rehabilitation protocols. Many references in the literature that indicate that early, aggressive rehabilitation regimens may cause a significant decrease in anchor fixation strength, laxity in the cuff reconstruction, and even the elevated failure rate of the operation. A review panel of surgeons in a diverse range of specialties will contribute specifications in the development process and critically review the system design and final project results.",

The alarming consequence of unnecessary antibiotic use is increasing resistance to antibiotics among bacterial strains responsible for OM. The accuracy of currently available noninvasive detection methods of middle ear effusion is not satisfactory, especially when the test is performed by primary health care providers. In Phase I we demonstrated the feasibility of noninvasive detection of middle ear effusion based on the analysis of ultrasonic echoes reflected from the tympanic membrane and the middle ear cavity. We achieved a statistically significant (P = 0.004) correlation between our ultrasonic method and myringotomy in the detection of the effusion and in differentiation between serous and mucoid states of the fluid. In Phase II, we propose development of a refined ultrasonic probe and analysis software to allow noninvasive detection of middle ear effusion and the estimation of the viscosity of the fluid occupying the middle ear. This latter feature is not available with any existing noninvasive detection method.  \n  \nWe will develop a miniature ultrasonic curved array transducer, which will be incorporated into an earplug (probe). The probe will allow for fast acquisition of ultrasonic scans from the ear canal and middle ear cavity.

Bacterial infection is a major complication associated with implantation of these prosthetic valves. Infections are localized to the biomaterial/tissue interface leading to cuff and annular abscess formation. In phase I, an infection-resistant knitted polyester (Dacron) cuff material was developed in vitro with optimum antimicrobial properties via thermofixation (pad/heat) dyeing of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (Cipro). Application of this technology resulted in slow, sustained antibiotic release without the use of exogenous binders. The goal of this phase II project is to assess this novel infection-resistant knitted Dacron cuff material in vivo. Our hypothesis is that application of quinolone antibiotics such as Cipro to Dacron sewing cuffs using our proprietary dyeing technology will significantly reduce cardiac valve infections when challenged with a significant bacterial inoculum. The specific aims of this phase II proposal are to: 1) apply Cipro to clinically-utilized sewing cuffs using technology developed in phase I,  2) evaluate antimicrobial activity of Cipro-dyed sewing cuffs via zone of inhibition,  3) examine physical properties of Cipro-dyed Dacron sewing cuffs, 4) implant unmodified (clinical standard) and Cipro-dyed sewing cuffs in a porcine heart valve infection model,  5) assess control and Cipro-dyed Dacron sewing cuffs via histological/microbiological techniques and  6) determine physical properties of Cipro-dyed sewing cuffs post-explantation. This technology, if successful, will be become the standard of care in the treatment of all forms of prosthetic endocarditis and may have an annual market in excess of $25 million.

        "abstract": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: The small intestine of the newly hatched chick and is immature and undergoes significant morphological, biochemical and physiological changes during the first 10 days post hatch. After this initial period, the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of the young monogastric animals becomes more capable of digesting and utilizing more nutrients. Chicks and poults during the first few days of age do not have the innate enzyme capability to digest complex nutrients, which ultimately result in increased microbial fermentation and altered gut viscosity. This condition adversely affects digestion and nutrient absorption, and as a result, causes decreased body weights and lowered feed efficiency in the birds. Within the last few years, both the academic and commercial agricultural research communities have come to realize the benefits that can result from the addition of specific enzymes to animal feeds for monogastric animals. For instance, the application of enzymes to animal feed has allowed greater dietary inclusion of ingredients previously thought to be unsuitable for animal feed. Virtually all enzymes employed in the feed industry are used as direct fed additives to achieve one or more of the following objectives: 1) Supplementation of the host's endogenous enzymes, including proteases and amylases; 2) Removal of anti-nutritional factors; 3) Improvement of bioavailability and absorption of certain nutrients and enhancement of energy value for cheaper feed ingredients.",

        "abstract": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: Net-pen aquaculture, in both freshwater and marine environments, is a large agricultural sector and produces a significant component of the world's fish for human consumption. Increasing pressure to generate profit and decrease production costs, plus pressure by the public and private sector to address ecological concerns associated with waste generated by these aquaculture operations, necessitates careful control of the fish feeding process. Fish feed is the major expense component of the production of fish in aquaculture operations. During the feeding process in net-pen aquaculture, a significant portion of the feed pellets, 10 to 40 percent, are not eaten by the fish and pass out of the net-pen. These wasted pellets pose both economic and environmental issues for the commercial net-pen operation. Feed waste also has negative impacts on fish health and product quality. There is strong demand from the industry for an efficient, reliable, and inexpensive system to monitor the feeding process, to minimize feed waste, and to maximize feeding efficiency. The Phase II pre-production prototype system will be integrated, compact, portable, and provide useful user interfaces, which will enable rapid modification of feeding operations to minimize wasting feed in net-pen aquaculture. The purpose of this project is to meet the needs of the aquaculture industry by producing the most reliable, cost effective, easily deployed and maintained system for enhancement of feeding efficiency and reduction of the associated negative environmental impacts.",

        "abstract": "The Air Force has identified a need to develop innovative concepts that use low-value assets to gather timely and accurate bomb damage assessment (BDA) information.  The focus of the Phase II research is to develop a munition deployed micro air vehicle(MAV) for BDA applications.  The concept is to attach an expendable MAV to an air-launched munition.  The MAV, which is housed in a parachute-equipped protective dispenser, is jettisoned from the munition at a pre-determined point along the munition'sdescent trajectory.  The parachute unfurls to decelerate the dispenser, thereby enabling the MAV to safely exit the dispenser and achieve stable flight.  The camera-equipped MAV autonomously navigates towards, and loiters in, the target area and transmitsreal-time BDA imagery for 20 minutes until its on-board power source is exhausted.  The SDI/UF team shall design and fabricate an MAV that accommodates the payload required for autonomous flight, yet fits within the small volume of an air-launchedmunition.  The MAV will incorporate UF's flexible-wing technology that features an airframe with a carbon fiber framework covered with a nylon monofilm membrane.  The MAV will be equipped with miniature camera and 2.4 GHz video transmitter.  Waypointnavigation will be achieved by utilizing an on-board avionics package that consists of a GPS receiver, inertial sensors, and magnetic and pressure sensors to stabilize and guide the air vehicle.  The MAV, with its wings folded, will be shock-isolatedwithin its protective dispenser.  The Phase II effort will culminate in an F-16 drop test at Eglin AFB.",

        "abstract": "The U.S. Air Force is pursuing the development of guided small diameter bombs (SDBs) while imposing challenging requirements for high-altitude launches at relatively slow speeds.  Recognizing that such systems and requirements may preclude the use ofconventional fuzes (e.g., the FMU-152), the Air Force has initiated efforts to develop innovative fuzes which do not derive arming power from the traditional air-turbine initiator but rather from the weapon's battery.  However, the elimination of the airturbine complicates the design of the fuze's safeing and arming (S&A) device, particularly for glide bombs.  The Phase I objective was to develop an innovative S&A algorithm which would be capable of isolating the fuze from the weapon's battery until theweapon was safe to arm.  The Phase I effort concluded that a three-stage S&A algorithm would satisfy this objective.  The algorithm included: a weapon-release module driven by umbilical separation indicators, a flight-detection module driven by IMU data,and a safe-separation module driven by a timer.  This proposed Phase II effort will expand the Phase I results by teaming with two leading fuze manufactures, Dayron and KDI Precision Products, to develop, test, and deliver two brassboardguidance-integrated fuzes, both of which implement the S&A algorithm.",

Recombinant human IL- 11 is approved and marketed as a treatment for thrombocytopenia in certain patients undergoing myelosuppressive cancer chemotherapy, the market for which is estimated to be $500 million. IL-11 has a short in vivo half-life and must be administered daily by subcutaneous injection to achieve optimal efficacy. The investigators propose to create modified IL-11 proteins that are equal, or superior, to natural IL- 11 at stimulating platelet formation in vivo, but which require less frequent dosing, on the order of once per week to once every third week. During Phase I the investigators identified sites in IL- 11 that can be modified without affecting the protein's in vitro bioactivity. During Phase II, sufficient quantities of the modified IL-11 proteins will be manufactured for testing of pharmacokinetics and efficacy in normal rodents and in rodent models of chemically induced thrombocytopenia. In the clinical setting, the improved properties of the novel IL-11 proteins will reduce the amount of IL-11 required per patient, improve patient compliance, and result in considerable cost savings to patients and healthcare providers. Additional potential benefits include improved drug efficacy, ease of use and improved patient quality of life.

The Harsh Environment Fluid Viscosity-Density Sensor consists of a packaged flexural plate wave (FPW) resonator instrumented with low cost, compact electronics for sensor read-out. In Phase I, the technical objectives were successfully accomplished by fabricating resonant FPW fluid sensors from harsh environment compatible single crystal SiC and epitaxial piezoelectric AlN materials, and demonstrated their ability to independently measure fluid viscosity and density. In Phase II, fully functional, packaged and electronically instrumented Harsh Environment Fluid Viscosity-Density Sensor prototypes will be developed and optimized for specific customer applications. The fluid sensors will be field tested in our customer's systems to demonstrate precise and accurate fluid viscosity and density measurements and stable operation in the customer's fluids and environmental conditions. After successful completion of Phase II, the Harsh Environment Fluid Viscosity-Density Sensor will be ready for scale-up manufacturing and commercialization in Phase III.\n\nThe Harsh Environment Fluid Viscosity-Density Sensor has commercial applications in 1) Condition-Based Maintenance of oils and other fluids in engines and industrial process equipment, 2) Process and Quality Control in manufacturing, chemical processing and water/waste treatment industries, and 3) down-hole sensors for Petrochemical Exploration and Extraction",

This project will develop an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF), as the dispersive element in the radiometer, which will reduce contamination error, provide higher resolution, and perform instantaneous measurement at any wavelength\u00bfall in a device with no moving parts.  Phase I designed and fabricated two dual-channel AOTFs that operated over the wavelength range from 360nm to 2500nm; demonstrated apodization techniques to minimize the sidelobes of the AOTF; and measured the diffraction efficiency and spectral resolution at various wavelengths.  Preliminary imaging, including solar imaging, in the visible and infrared regions (360nm to 1100nm) was demonstrated.  Phase II will focus on developing two radiometer systems:  a complete imaging radiometer system that uses silicon CCD arrays in the wavelength range from 360\u00bf1100nm, and a radiometer that uses a dual wavelength detector in the wavelength range from 360\u00bf2500nm.

        "abstract": "This proposal addresses the use of nuclear isomers as energy-storage/energy-delivery systems for defense and civilian applications. Nuclear isomers are long-lived (>1ns) excited states of nuclei that release their excess energy by electromagnetic decay.The nuclear state energy densities stored in some isomers are 103 to 104 times higher per unit mass (\u00bf\u00bf109 J/g) than for chemical systems. This leads directly to the possible application of isomers as batteries to provide useful energy in space orbattlefield operations or as flash discharge devices to provide an intense pulse of penetrating electromagnetic radiation. The utility of isomers for energy storage depends on their half-life (T1/2\u00bf\u00bf1 year or greater) and net energy gain, and on theability both to produce them and to stimulate the release of their stored energy. This Phase II research project will 1) investigate a novel method that could provide > 1016 nuclei of the isomer 178m2Hf in a highly concentrated form for future triggeringstudies, and 2) investigate methods to produce and trigger other isomers that are candidates for high-density energy storage.

In addition, there are many space-based applications, including sommmunications and power sources for interplanetary travel and future space stations.

The 5-year survival rate in the US is 13% when all stages are considered. Substantial evidence suggests that early detection of lung cancer may reduce mortality for patients with stage T1 NxMx. High-resolution CT can detect lung nodules when they are still small. But it is currently difficult for radiologists to distinguish those that are malignant from those that are benign.   \n  \nWe propose to develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to assist radiologists in the diagnosis of lung cancer in thoracic computed tomography (CT). The CT-CAD system will enable radiologists to robustly measure and analyze the suspicious lesions, effectively visualize the region of interest, and improve differentiation between malignant and benign nodules. Specifically, this SBIR phase II effort includes (1) continuous development of dedicated lung cancer diagnostic tools, (2) development of a complete CT-CAD system for accurate analysis of small lung lesions, (3) evaluation of the proposed system functions and integration of them in a CAD-specific 3D visualization platform; and (4) evaluation of the radiologists performance with and without using the CT-CAD system using the MRMC-ROC study protocol. The successful development of the proposed CT-CAD system can significantly benefit the existing CT lung cancer diagnosis in two-fold: (a) improving sensitivity for lung cancer detection and (b) improving the accuracy of lung cancer diagnosis in CT and leading to reduction of unnecessary biopsies. We expect that this CT-CAD can facilitate remote reading by experts and will also increase radiologists' efficiency in reading large image arrays and reducing the observer variations in thoracic CT image interpretation.",

Effective technologies for the detection andidentification of biological warfare agents (BWAs) are of critical and growing importance. Despite ongoing advances in this area, current technologies are limited by a combination of poor sensitivity, excessive reagent usage, lengthy detection cycles,excessive power consumption, and poor BWA discrimination. In contrast, the technology proposed here, called MS3, is capable of identifying a wide range of BWAs including bacteria, toxins, and viruses by using a novel microfluidic detection platform basedon protein biomarkers. Furthermore, the platform will provide high throughput and high sensitivity, with significant reductions in false positives.

The MS3 system requires no bioreagents for improved simplicity, repeatability, and overall robustness. To meet the demands from a range of potential markets, the overall system will be low-cost,with disposable detection elements to eliminate the danger of cross-contamination without the need for complex and time-consuming system regeneration.",

        "abstract": "Basic research aimed at understanding the complex regulations and interactions lead to various diseases requires novel bioanalytical approaches that allow detailed characterization of the proteome with ultra high-speed and sensitivity so that important regulatory proteins can be effectively studied. For the analysis of complex protein mixtures such as cell lysates, two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE) is still the method of choice for separating more than thousands of proteins. For the identification of proteins resolved on 2-D PAGE, individual protein spots are excised from the gel, washed, in-gel reduced, S-alkylated, and in-gel digested with an excess of trypsin, followed by the extraction of protein digest for mass spectrometry analysis. All of these procedures are time-consuming tasks prone to sample loss and analyte dilution, particularly in the analysis of low abundant proteins. Thus, questions remain concerning the ability to characterize all of the elements of a proteome using 2-D PAGE and mass spectrometry analysis. Our research objectives under this project will provide the critically needed link between 2-D PAGE and mass spectrometric analysis, namely the electronic protein transfer in an automated and integrated platform. We will develop and validate the technical basis for rapidly and efficiently extracting negatively charged SDS-protein complexes from polyacrylamide gel into fused-silica capillary using their intrinsic electrophoretic mobilities under the influence of high electric field strengths. This gel protein capillary extraction platform equipped with the ultra-high sensitivity and extremely large dynamic range of laser- induced fluorescence detection promises to have a major impact on proteomics research, particularly in \"differential display\" for comparisons of protein expression with potential applications in a wide range of diseases. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The resulting bioanalytical tools will provide much greater speed, throughput, and sensitivity for linking 2-D Page with mass spectrometric analysis than existing technology toward direct proteomic analysis. We anticipate the technology to be adopted in research laboratories, pharmaceutical companies, and clinical settings.",

This grant application has as its goal the preclinical development of a degradable poly(propylene glycol-co-fumaric acid) (\"PPF\")-based bone graft extender containing osteoconductive hydroxylapatite fillers that can be mixed with osteoinductive cancellous autologous bone graft prior to implantation into a bony defect. In the Phase I SBIR feasibility project, Cambridge Scientific, Inc demonstrated in a small animal model that the addition of a PPF-based bone replacement material to autograft bone enhances osteointegratior of autograft which, in turn, has an effect on bony ingrowth. Following this demonstration of PPF/autograft enhancement of new bone formation, Cambridge Scientific, Inc will, in Phase II, evaluate the use of the extender material in a large animal (sheep) defect model to address the eventual clinical use of the extender in the reconstruction of significant skeletal defects. The development of new bone should couple to implant degradation in such a way that the structural integrity of the defect site is maintained throughout the recovery process Osteoinductive autograft material used in conjunction with an osteoconductive and mechanically stable resorbable scaffold would be attractive for both induction and expansion of new bone formation.",

Since the unit costs associated with traditional production toolmaking are extremely high for small runs, this innovation makes possible low cost prototypesand low cost replacement parts for aerospace systems. Phase I identified novel thermally stable composite matrix resins which cure under UV light to rapidly produce tools with ceramic-like facing.  This resin permits PHOTOMOLDING, the fabrication withlight of high performance composite tools at a fraction of the cost and time required for production tools. Phase I research demonstrated that the low temperature  cure conditions of PHOTOMOLDING are mild enough to allow actual parts to be used astemplates.  When post-cured, the ceramic-like facing allows multiple runs with high temperature-curing matrix resins such as bismaleimides.  Furthermore, unlike metals, the CTE of the composite tools can be matched to the intended use by varying  thetool's matrix resin composition. Phase II expands the methodology for preparing these novel composite tools by  optimizing materials  and by demonstrating a number of practical applications.  PHOTOMOLDING is compatible with CAD and advanced robotic fiberplacement technology.  Thus it can be used in composite prototyping, injection mold fabrication, carbon-carbon composite tooling and on-aircraft repair.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II Project will develop software to aid formulation chemists in the replacement of environmentally damaging and toxic solvents such as those listed as hazardous air pollutants (HAP) in Section 112(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act. Phase I provided successful proof of concept for MCT's approach to use mixtures of \"green\" solvents that are tunable to obtain a wide range of solvent characteristics. This approach allows for the replacement of a broad spectrum of harmful solvents by using a small number of benign solvents. The system is flexible, allowing end users to control factors such as the organic functional groups present to fit their application. MCT will incorporate this method into software to guide non-specialists through the selection of solvents and optimization the mixture. MCT will collaborate with the research groups of Professors Charles Eckert and Charles Liotta at the Georgia Institute of Technology to develop a predictive model for the solubility of metal-organic compounds in organic solvents. We will perform quantitative solubility measurements on the systems initially studied in Phase I and use the resulting data to verify and improve the solubility model. The resulting solubility model will be incorporated in the solvent selection software.\n\nThe recent trend towards environmentally friendly products has caused an increase in the use of green solvents in product formulations and industrial processes.  Regulations governing the use of solvents classified as Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAP) or as Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) are forcing companies to look for alternatives to solvents presently in use. Therefore, there is an opportunity for the introduction of products that are designed to assist companies that need to reformulate products or processes that use organic solvents. The niche market for reformulation tools is estimated to fall into the $30 million range. MCT's goal is to release a software product that meets these needs within 3 years, and to gain the majority of the market share, producing revenues of $10 million over a period of 6 years. MCT will license software\ndeveloped under Phase II to companies that manufacture chemicals and allied products.  Solvent replacement tools can be applied to find alternative solvents almost anywhere solvents are in use, including coatings, pharmaceuticals, printing inks, toiletries, cosmetics, adhesives, household and car care, rubber and polymer manufacturing, industrial cleaning and degreasing, agrochemicals, oil seed and food extraction and dry cleaning.",

        "abstract": "70631S02-II     Rare earth orthophosphate crystals could satisfy the requirements for improved scintillators needed for nuclear physics experiments.  These requirements include fast decay time (approximately 30 nsec with no slow component), greater light output compared to current materials, a radiation length less than 2 cm, and the ability to be grown in a large size.  All of these requirements could be met at reasonable cost if a suitable solvent system and growth technique could be identified for cerium-doped gadolinium orthophosphate.  In this project, a new solvent system will be studied to identify the solution region from which cerium-doped gadolinium orthophosphate can be grown.  The solution characteristics and phase relationships for this system will be investigated to determine the feasibility of growing large cerium-doped gadolinium orthophosphate crystals by top-seeded solution growth.  In Phase I, fourteen solution compositions were studied to determine the solid phases present.  The amount of solid precipitate, its phase composition, and its crystal morphology were determined by x-ray diffraction and microscopy techniques.  Conditions for the formation of phase-pure GdPO4 crystals were determined, and small crystals of cerium-doped GdPO4 were grown.  Phase II will develop and optimize a top-seeded solution growth technique for growing large cerium-doped crystals.  The cerium concentration will be optimized for maximum light output.  Scintillator elements will be fabricated and polished to determine spectroscopic properties.     Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  Cerium-doped gadolinium orthophosphate should have better characteristics than cerium doped gadolinium orthosilicate, which is a major scintillator crystal utilized in positron emission tomography.  The growth technology for this orthophosphate crystal would allow the possibility of incorporating a series of rare earth analog crystals into many commercial laser systems.",

In order to make these systems commercially viable, a portion of the hydrogen in syngas needs to be recovered as a value-added byproduct through the use of hydrogen separation membranes such as proton-conducting membranes.  Since current membrane technologies for hydrogen separation are incompatible with the high-temperature, high-pressure environment in IGCC systems, robust and efficient membrane systems are required.  This project will develop a novel, dense, ceramic-composite membrane that will function as a mixed protonic/electronic conductor under expected IGCC operating conditions.  These mixed-conducting composite membranes will allow pressure-driven hydrogen separation at 800-900\u00bfC, and at higher flux-rates than possible with single phase membranes, thus resulting in a very-high-purity hydrogen stream.  In Phase I, the feasibility of the process for forming mixed conducting protonic/electronic conductors was demonstrated.  It was determined that a flux of over 9 cc/cm2/min through a 15 cm membrane can be achieved.  Additionally, it was demonstrated that the new materials have increased thermochemcial stability in CO2-containing atmospheres, compared to materials in conventional proton conductors.  In Phase II, a single-wafer module will be built and tested to demonstrate the hydrogen flux necessary for commercial feasibility.    Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The hydrogen separation membrane should have a major impact on the commercial feasibility of IGCC systems and other industrial hydrogen recovery/separation processes.

The proposedprocess is a low-temperature, net-shape fabrication techniquethat is efficient, cost-effective, scalable and environmentallyfriendly (no hazardous byproducts).  The proposed material is aceramic with nano or sub-micron sized particles whose compositionand microstructure can be tailored, depending on the specificrequirements of the application, by simple changes in processingtechnique.  The Phase I Project clearly demonstrated thefeasibility of this material/process for ceramic componentmicrofabrication and thermomechanical stability up to 800 C.

The high production capacity and sub-micron dimensional tolerances for components fabricated using this material/technique makes it an attractive optionfor optic fiber component manufacturers.  The advantages offered by CERCANAM include high-temperature performance and mechanical reliability compared with silicon or plastics, and significantly lower processing costs compared with zirconia ferrules.Further, the material/fabrication technique also has direct relevance to other devices such as micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), packaging for electronic components and microchannel devices.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common dementia, resulting in devastating declines in cognition, quality of life, and financial burden to society. Unfortunately, the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and the associated costs are predicted to dramatically increase in the future, due to shifts in life expectancy and demographics. Current treatments with cholinesterase inhibitors provide only modest symptomatic relief to a proportion of patients and do not alter disease progression. It has been well established in animal studies that nerve growth factor (NGF) delivery to the brain can prevent the death of and reverse the decline of the  \nsame cholinergic neurons associated with the cognitive decline in aging and AD.   However, attempts to apply these data to clinical patients by application of intracerebroventricular (ICV) NGF protein infusion resulted in significant adverse effects of weight loss and back pain, due to NGF effects in non-target regions of the CNS.  \nThus, a means of precisely, selectively, and chronically delivering NGF to degenerating basal forebrain  \ncholinergic neurons in Alzheimer's brains are required. Gene therapy potentially offers such a means. In vivo gene therapy, where vectors are directly injected into the brain, is the most feasible approach for wide-scale commercialization of gene delivery to the central nervous system (CNS).  Ceregene Inc. is pursuing commercialization of in vivo gene therapy to deliver NGF to degenerating cholinergic neurons in the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Studies completed in our SBIR Phase I grant period resulted in the design and selection of our lead clinical vector, CERE-110, a replication incompetent genetically engineered adeno-associated virus carrying the human NGF transgene. In our SBIR Phase II grant period, we aim to complete preclinical pharmacology and toxicology/safety studies of CERE-110 in rats and monkeys and file an IND for a Phase 1/11clinical study of CERE-110 in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. Successful clinical trials would result in the commercialization of CERE-110 as a therapeutic agent for patients with Alzheimer's disease, providing for the first time a means of reducing actual cell loss in any human neurological disorder.",

In Phase I of thisSBIR, the feasibility of using LES to predict CO and NOx emissions in a practical gas turbine combustor was demonstrated.  Combustion LES predictions of a Rolls-Royce production combustor were compared with experimental combustor exit data. LES producedunsteady turbulent structures that enhanced mixing compared to steady-state CFD analysis.  LES, at high power conditions, had good agreement with exit emissions data.  However, at low power, LES predictions of CO emissions were poor, due to simplificationsin the fuel and CO oxidation mechanisms.  In Phase II, the LES code will be improved by incorporating a multi-step assumed PDF method that accounts for more detailed kinetics with turbulent mixing interactions.  Tabulation methods will be implemented andtested for improved computational efficiency.  The final code will be validated against benchmark experimental data, and then applied to the Rolls-Royce and potentially Pratt & Whitney JSF combustors.

The ability to reduce emissions, avoid combustion-driven instability, and to investigate high-payoff ideas will be possible.

This design has the potential of greatly reducing NOx, CO, and smoke at fullpower compared to current JSF designs. In addition, the proposed design is affordable, and provides good thermal protection of the fuel.      In Phase I, CFDRC showed the feasibility of the proposed fuel injector.  In Phase II, the fuel injector will be further developed for JSF.  CFD analyses will be used to predict emissions at various power points provided by our selected subcontractor,Rolls-Royce, Indianapolis.  Prototype hardware will be fabricated and tested at ambient conditions, to select the most promising configurations.  The best configurations will be tested in a existing single injector, high pressure rig at Rolls-Royce.  Tworounds (design-cycles) are planned.

This Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)-based approach has beenshown to accurately simulate the urban wind and turbulence fields with minimal approximations, and has been demonstrated by modeling the flow fields and simulated release of CBW agent near the White House and in a region of Salt Lake City. This UrbanDispersion Simulator (UDS) utilizes recent advances in modern CFD algorithms, uses an automated model setup via a unique image-based approach, and is driven by an intuitive interface. Based upon the very positive results of the Phase I study, a number ofphysical modeling, speed and interface enhancements are proposed. These include modeling buoyancy, solar radiation, tree-induced flow losses, HVAC effects, and the dispersal of gas-phase agents as well as solid and liquid dispersants. The simulator willprovide rapid simulation turnaround times by remotely distributed parallel processing, solution-adaptive mesh refinement and other algorithm refinements for unsteady dispersal calculations. A Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) implementationof the UDS interface will be developed to allow the UDS laptop-based front-end the transparent access of a remotely distributed compute server by wireless or wired connection. Provision for direct import of a variety of CAD formats, such DXF and VRML, willbe made. Careful validation studies of important experimental and urban wind fields and dispersion will be made to archive the effects of different wind and turbulence profiles upon the solution quality. The developed capability and software (UrbanDispersion Simulator, UDS) will be of immediate use for DTRA and many affiliated agencies and contractors. UDS will be beneficial to such Government agencies as the FBI, CIA and Secret Service. Hazardous Material Teams (HAZMAT) will benefit by predictinghazardous plume development in urban areas, and Civilian building architects could assess the wind fields and dispersion characteristics in cities to meet currently mandated regulations.",

Validation of the CFD based predictions was completed using a combination of published AMCOM test data and thixotropic flow measurements within the open literature.  To fully quantify the time-dependent properties ofgelled propellants, a pressure drop/flow rate rheometer capable of evaluating all possible gel-propulsion flow system components will be designed, fabricated, and operated during Phase II.  Current gel rheological models will be refined and validated forgel flows between -40\u00bfC and 70\u00bfC and shear rates from 5,000 sec-1 to 200,000 sec-1.  All gel propellant rheological tests will be conducted at the AMCOM Propulsion Directorate.  The final empirical correlations will be: 1) implemented in a systemfluid-flow network solver in use by leading propulsion manufacturers and 2) compiled for publication in JANNAF proceedings.  High fidelity numerical simulations will be utilized throughout Phase II to precisely account for temperature, Reynolds number,shear rate and geometric effects on the thixotropic behavior of gelled propellants in future tactical missile, DACS, upper stage and in-space propulsion systems.Once the rheology of gelled propellants is fully documented, programmatic development riskassociated with future DoD and NASA operational systems that could utilize gel propulsion will be significantly reduced.

Results obtained during Phase I work definitively show the technical feasibility of the microwave catalytic oxidation process for destruction of hydrocarbons andother chemical agents in water contaminated through front line washing of military vehicles. The Phase I experimentation shows that pollutants such as gasoline, diethyl sulfide (simulant of HD gas), detergent, and JP-8 fuel are easily destroyed using theCHA microwave process. Furthermore, the granulated activated carbon (GAC) used during the experimentation is easily regenerated, with the adsorption capacity returned to original levels. The significance of these results show that the CHA process cancompletely treat wastewater generated at the front lines.In Phase II, a prototype will be constructed and used for a field demonstration.  The prototype will be tested at CHA Corporation's laboratory using a simulated wastewater stream and then transported to the selected Army base for field demonstration. Theeffectiveness of the CHA process in destroying contaminants in vehicle wash water will be verified during the field demonstration.  Phase II work will result in a cost-effective, successful process that can be used to treat vehicle-washing wastewater.The primary benefit is a portable microwave system that is capable of treating wastewater produced from the washing of Army combat vehicles at front lines. The microwave recycle-washing process is also directly applicable to treat and recycle wastewaterproduced from vehicle-washing facilities at Army bases in the United States. A secondary benefit could be a portable microwave unit capable of providing safe drinking water for Army personnel in a combat zone at front lines. Due to environmentalregulations, applications may also be found in civilian businesses. Since microwave-GAC catalytic oxidation is very effective in destroying car-wash soap, the use of microwave vehicle-washing system would allow the commercial washing industries to use themore effective cleaning soaps with a simple recycling process.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cause of arrhythmias in the elderly; it has an incidence of more than 5 percent in people > 69 years of age. At present, there is no satisfactory treatment of this disease. The ChanTest Phase I SBIR was directed towards the discovery of novel drugs for this disease and in these experiments, the investigators identified a substituted piperidine compound that promises to be an effective antiarrhythmic agent. They found that this drug blocks the hERG/IKr current at low nanomolar concentrations, yet does not prolong the action potential duration in canine Purkinje fibers at micromolar concentrations as might be expected. The investigators hypothesized that the drug also blocked cardiac Na and Ca currents at nanomolar concentrations and, as a result, the hERG/IKr block was offset and there was no change in action potential duration. The drug had another useful characteristic, namely the forward use-dependence of a drug that is most effective at faster heart rates. This drug was in clinical trials in the late 1970s as an antidepressant and although it was safe, did not have the desired efficacy. It is now in clinical trials as a treatment for substance abuse. In neither of these trials were proarrhythmic tendencies noted and the ECGs in both sets of trials were unaffected. Because its properties are so favorable, ChanTest has filed a use patent on the drug for treatment of cardiac arrhythmias in general, and AF in particular. Given its very high affinity for hERG, a radioactive derivative can be used in high throughput displacement studies to test for non-cardiac drugs that may bind to hERG. Identifications of such drugs are of considerable importance for safety pharmacology. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) complete in vitro tests of the effects of the drug on other cardiac membrane currents ITo, IKs and IK1; 2) test the drug's efficacy in animal models of AF; 3) test the drug's safety in the cardiac muscle wedge preparation that is presently the best predictor of the potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmia torsade de pointes (TdP); and 4) characterize the drug congeners as tools for HTS displacement studies of drugs that bind hERG. After the drug passes the hurdles of the specific aims, ChanTest will file a 355(b)(2) NDA application with the FDA to go forward with the Phase II and III clinical trials. ChanTest believes that this drug will offer great relief to the many people who are debilitated by atrial fibrillation.",

This model is based on morerealistic assumptions about the possible return waveforms, nongaussian noise, clutter and reverberation than existing approaches. Implementing a bank of optimized test statistics appropriate for mid-frequency, broadband waveforms, we have demonstrated a 5to 6 dB improvement over the conventional replica correlator for a developmental, at-sea active sonar system. The potential gains in tactical systems is larger as the data available for Phase I was not pre-processed consistent with our requirements,Simulations indicate gains of as much as 10 dB are possible in Phase II. Our processor is also easily integrated into existing systems and is computationally efficient, which makes it attractive for other applications. In this project, we will use ourpre-existing technology to specify, construct, and test a new class of active processors for waveforms of interest to the sponsor with the objective of demonstrating similar improvements for fleet sonars.  The benefits in active sonar include increaseddetection range and higher detection confidence at a reduced false alarm rate. Further, these same benefits can be expected for pulse compression and broadband radar. This technology also has applications in seismic survey technologies.",

        "abstract": "Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is critical to document management workflow in both Army and civilian scenarios. It is also one of its weakest links, having no turnkey or standardized solution. Low quality documents imaged under adverse conditionsexhibit severe image artifacts, such as uneven illumination, low contrast, speckle noise, degraded character glyphs (broken, joined, aliased), rotational skew, and page warp (perspective skew and curved baselines). These artifacts catastrophically degradeOCR performance. Processing large volumes of such documents using manual clean-up is prohibitively expensive.We propose to enhance and fully implement our Autonomous Intelligent Document Analysis system (AIDA), which pre-processes document images (bitmaps) to boost OCR performance. AIDA consists of a set of document image quality metrics, each detecting aspecific artifact type, and a suite of corresponding image enhancement algorithms. AIDA's greatest novelty is a knowledge-based approach to automatically determine the optimal enhancement operator sequence and parameter values, based solely on computedquality metrics. We demonstrated feasibility in Phase I by developing detection and correction of three artifact types in Arabic and English documents and by prototyping the knowledge-base framework. In Phase II, we will handle character glyph restoration,tackle additional artifacts that severely degrade performance, and explore multi-OCR optimization.AIDA can have an immediate role in increasing OCR accuracy for anti-terrorist intelligence (for example in the CHIMS Army project), where documents are frequently imaged under adverse conditions. AIDA also has direct applicability to financial services,medical records, litigation support, and record archiving for corporations, universities, and government.

Our Scoring, Truthing And Registration Toolkit (START) offers a consistent set of post-data collection tools for ATR algorithm performanceevaluation. Our primary design goals are to decrease operator effort when entering registration and truth information, increase accuracy of truth information, and develop standardized scoring metrics for assessing ATR algorithm performance. Using START,all imagery for one scene is registered to a common reference frame (geo-registered if needed) such that target locations, identity, orientation, etc. need only be specified once per scene. This reduces operator error since registration requires less skillthan identifying targets. START then computes a variety of standard scoring metrics suggested by the ATR community (and ATRWG in particular).Our Phase II effort will focus on 3D geo-registration capabilities, automatic placement of registration tie-points, scoring difficult ATR tasks (moving targets, change detection, sensor fusion, multi-look data), sensitivity analysis, and a human factorsanalysis optimizing the usability of START.",

Furthermore, advances in sensors and communications haveresulted in an explosion in the quantity and complexity of information available to the pilot. The pilot wastes precious time sorting through potentially redundant, irrelevant, or conflicting data; there is too much data and too little time.We therefore propose to develop a Situation-Adaptive Rotorcraft Information Filter (SARIF) to perform semantic-fusion-based correlation for message streams within the Special Operations avionics upgrade program, the Common Aviation Architecture System(CAAS).

It will feature a correlator and a classifier to relate incoming messages to existing knowledge and prioritize messages according to the currenttactical situation and mission plan. SARIF will run on an embedded processor in the CAAS general-purpose processing unit. The output will be to the CAAS world-state database, which drives cockpit displays.SARIF will fit directly into the Special Operations avionics upgrade program, the Common Aviation Architecture System (CAAS). Through collaboration with Rockwell Collins, CAAS prime contractor, SARIF is expected to go to Phase III and be deployed alongwith CAAS on around 200 Special Operations helicopters.

        "abstract": "We propose an M&S-based approach that extends a cognitive modeling architecture to account for the effects of behavior moderators (BMs) on cognitive performance. We will model the effects of two classes of BMs: 1) individual differences representingvariations in behavior across individuals; and 2) environmental stressors that vary an individual's responses as a function of situation. Our approach to Modeling INdividual Differences and Stressors (MINDS) will be carried out in three phases: 1)selection of a set of BMs  relevant to soldier performance and mapping of those moderators to cognitive processes; 2) incorporation of these BMs within a cognitive modeling architecture; and 3) integration of the soldier model within a combat simulationenvironment. To support flexibility in this approach, we propose to augment our modeling environment with three additional components: 1) an interface between the BM representation and the underlying cognitive architecture, allowing for integration with anumber of cognitive frameworks; 2) a simulation interface between the MINDS model and the combat simulation environment, allowing for the deployment of advanced HBMs within a range of simulations; and 3) a suite of HBM development and analysis tools thatsupport the end user in the construction, deployment, and analysis of MINDS models.  Significant focus in the US Army's Objective Force Warrior (OFW) program will be placed on enhancing the individual soldier and small unit's performance with respect toinformation-oriented operations. Therefore, we believe that the proposed MINDS system will provide significant insight into how individuals can best be supported in these very cognitively-intensive tasks, in a manner that account for their own style ofwork, personality and biases, as well as situationally-induced performance limiters such as workload and stress. The initial focus of our commercialization effort will be the enhancement of our Intelligent Agent Toolkit (IAT) product, via the incorporationof routines for modeling the effects of individual differences and environmental stressors from the proposed MINDS system.",

        "abstract": "We propose a Phase II program to develop and demonstrate an analyst decision aid that incorporates Organizational and Cultural Criteria in Adversary Modeling (OCCAM).  OCCAM aids the PSYOP/IO analyst by leveraging known organizational and culturalknowledge to infer potential target biases and predict likely target behavior in data-sparse environments.Under Phase I, we demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed cultural profiling approach in the context of a culturally rich SASO scenario.  Specifically, we identified individual and group attributes and organizational and cultural stereotypes, enablinga profiling approach that supports behavior prediction.  Key elements of the approach include: the specification of organizational/cultural influence on target behavior; representation of organizational/cultural stereotypes; and the management ofuncertainty.Under Phase II, we propose to expand the decision aid's capabilities by: 1) developing and refining the organizational and cultural stereotypes across a broader range of scenario vignettes; 2) expanding target profiling capabilities by including a broaderset of AI inferencing techniques; 3) expanding the behavior prediction capabilities by incorporating situational factors, additional representational formalisms, and management and representation of meta-information (e.g., uncertainty, recency) about bothraw and inferred data; and 4) demonstrating and validating the OCCAM architecture and software prototype.

Our objective in this effort is to develop an approach for Context-driven Infospace Configuration forAugmented Cognitive Readiness to support task execution in complex, high-value and high-risk mission environments. In Phase I we demonstrated the general feasibility of the approach for Air Operation Center (AOC) tasks in the context of a Destruction ofEnemy Air Defenses scenario. The elicited knowledge, and the proposed cognitive model, in conjunction with the prototyped technology for automated tactical situation interpretation have shown how information delivery and functional access can be configuredto increase warfighter situational understanding and task performance.In Phase II, we propose to expand the prototyped capability by eliciting a comprehensive collection of supporting knowledge, and by developing a comprehensive inferential framework for predicting information needs and tasks associated with a givenoperational context. In combination with an enhanced cognitive model, this framework will allow the concentration of information and processing access within AOCs into a mission-centric interface with increased task effectiveness and reduced overload. Theresulting prototype will support integration with the current AOC environments, and other C2 applications.",

        "abstract": "Sensor management and, more specifically, the capability to automate scheduling and dynamically re-task sensor assets in light of changing operational requirements and mission objectives is a crucial factor for ensuring information dominance for ourwarfighters. Here, we propose a Sensor Task Optimization and Real-time Management (STORM) system for the scheduling, coordination, and path planning of heterogeneous sensor assets and the dynamic adaptation and replanning of those assets in response tochanging battlespace conditions. The system uses GIS processing along with target and threat prediction to prioritize the area to be searched. Scheduling is accomplished using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), which is an agent-based approach thatincorporates heterogeneous sensors and a high-fidelity model of the mission environment. Plan execution monitoring is used in conjunction with ACO to make real-time adjustments to the plan to account for changing and unexpected conditions.For Phase II we will: 1) enhance the Phase I system; 2) expand functionality to address replanning; 3) implement a full-scope prototype; 4) demonstrate performance across multiple tactical scenarios; 5) provide a transition plan for follow-on systemintegration as a GCCS-M segment for sensor management decision support; and 6) and determine requirements for commercialization. Commercial applications of the proposed approach to schedule optimization exist for a wide variety of domains including transportation, airways and railway time-tabling, and inventory control. In addition, the proposed effort will impact the developmentand enhancement of our Intelligent Agent Toolkit (IAT) product, via the incorporation of the adaptation and scheduling components of the proposed STORM developed under this SBIR effort.",

In Phase I we demonstrated the general feasibility of the approach in the context of a UA/UE pursuit andexploitation scenario at the Brigade/Battalion level. The elicited knowledge, the proposed cognitive model, and the developed prototype system supported the representation of doctrine, user role, and mission task elements, and the automated extraction ofcritical elements of the tactical situation to infer geospatial information needs for several categories of users.In Phase II, we propose to expand the toolset's capability by eliciting a comprehensive collection of supporting knowledge and by developing a detailed inferential model that supports the prediction of geospatial information needs.

The resulting prototype will support integrationwith the Army's Combat Terrain Information System and the Battlespace Terrain Reasoning and Awareness system.We see several potential applications of the proposed technology.

        "abstract": "Moore's law states that computing performance doubles every 18 months. While this has held true for 40 years, it is widely believed that this will soon come to an end. Increases in performance coincide with decreases in scale on the computer platform. Dueto the small scale of computer components, both interference effects are starting to play a role in the development of new components. This implies that there is also a limit to how fast a classical computer can become.  Quantum computation offers apotential solution to the eventual failure of Moore's law. Quantum computers are not constrained by the size issue related to classical computers. Researchers have already shown that efficient quantum algorithms exist and can perform some calculationssignificantly faster than classical computers. Quantum computers require very different algorithms than classical computers, so the challenge of quantum computation is to develop efficient quantum algorithms. Cybernet proposes to create a quantum imageprocessing toolkit that will serve as the foundation of quantum systems that perform important, low-level functions within the military (such as target tracking, video based navigation, etc.).",

This main task is to present topographicinformation in a way that conveys a three-dimensional image on the computer screen. Because Cybernet has worked in the past to develop computer games, we are experienced with the techniques used to generate the illusion of 3-dimensional images on a flatcomputer screen. These techniques are essential if a computer game is to generate an engrossing and exciting gaming experience. During the Phase I project, we applied many of these gaming techniques to create a graphical software package called theTactical Terrain Viewer, which can be used by soldiers in the field to view complex topographic information.  For the Phase II project, the TTV software will be integrated into the field platform and provide a user interface so that the soldier can accessthe desired data. We expect that the TTV will be connected to existing Land Warrior software, enhancing the existing software by providing 3D imagery.Commercial applications include navigation, architecture/landscape CADD, and computer games.",

FCS includes multiple automatic fire weapons. One such weapon is the RAMM. The RAMM is an automaticfire mortar turret that can be integrated with various vehicle bodies. On previous automatic systems, a human manually entered information about each weapon loaded. This is a slow process, placing the soldier and the weapon in danger. Our Phase I effortproved that it is possible to create an optical system that can recognize the munition type as it is loaded into the magazine. The system can also determine the lot number of the munition from the text on the shell. The system uses a combination of shape,color, and text to identify the munition. The system processes the data in real-time, allowing the user to load the mortars as quickly as possible. In the Phase II effort, we will create a completely functional prototype system that can determine munitiontype under real-life conditions. We will create an embedded version of the system components to show that the system can be integrated directly into the RAMM.The system to be developed in the Phase II effort will be immediately applicable to the RAMMproject. The initial commercial application will be a true integration into the RAMM. The system will also be useful for other automatic fire weapon systems (such as Crusader).",

During the Phase I effort, a prototypetracking and monitoring system was developed that utilizes Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements to measure a vehicle's position along with inertial sensors to measure its dynamics.  The system logs these measurements for detailed analysis later,and also communicates them to a remote site in real-time using a low-bandwidth satellite link.  In addition to measuring vehicle dynamics, the inertial sensors can be used to produce a position estimate even when GPS is unavailable due to occlusions of thesky.  During this Phase II effort, we propose to refine the prototype vehicle dynamics measurement system to improve usability, packaging, and lower unit costs.  In addition, we will develop software that will provide outputs compatible with commercialgeographic information systems (GIS) and data analysis systems.  To evaluate their usability and overall utility, these systems will be evaluated during an actual exercise at a training center during this phase of the program to aid in the development of afinal commercial product.This product has direct application to quantifying environmental impact monitoring by numerous federal agencies including the Department of Defense (DoD), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and the National Forest Service.

In an April 2003 experiment at Redstone Arsenal, precision guided missiles could not distinguish between destroyed targets, and targetsstill presenting a threat.  Typically, 6 missiles launched at 5 vehicles all hit the same target, leaving 4 undamaged vehicles.  This caused shortages of missiles, and blue force casualties.BDAR prevents this scenario.  BDAR performs real time sensor fusion, battle damage assessment, and retargeting of in-flight precision munitions.  In the BDAR concept, sensors provide initial targeting data to an effects control network, which targetsprecision weapons against a target array.  Initial targeting distributes precision munitions by assigning the right number and type to the array.  As munitions begin hitting the target array, sensors begin determining battle damage.  As sensors determine atarget is destroyed, they communicate this data to the effects control network causing retargeting of in-flight munitions, or directly communicate with and retarget in-flight munitions.In Phase I, CHI Systems developed the design and initial algorithms for BDAR.  In Phase II, the technology will be implemented as a component of the ARDEC Combat Decision Aiding System (CDAS) architecture, and be compliant with the JTA-A.The BDAR decision aid will be an answer to the current problem of expending scarce munitions on unprofitable targets.  Complete implementation of the decision aid during Phase II of the effort is intended to take place within the context of the CDASprogram and will support FCS netted fires technology requirements.

An important determinant of the success of these synthetic actors isthe construction of a framework to represent significant aspects of their cultural background and affective processes, and to model the behavioral consequences of these in the context of scenario-specific goals and interactions with live trainees.Finally, a functional software prototype of the VECTOR concept working in a virtual environment with synthetic actors and speech interaction will be demonstrated. VECTOR will provide cultural familiarization through immersion, which will result in morerapid and effective training.  Such a training capability has extraordinary potential for improving the outcomes of non-conventional military engagements.  Apart from use across the range of U.S. Armed Forces, such training is also applicable to foreignmilitary organizations for preparation in joint operations.  The technologies could be adapted for use by the State Department, and has widespread utility for multinational corporations with far-flung operations and a requirement to maintain goodcommunications.  At a reduced scale (i.e., in a desktop configuration, or distributed via the Web), such training systems are also useful to foreign-language students and travelers.  The techniques for rendering of cultural characteristics of syntheticactors in virtual simulations are also directly applicable for representation of other kinds of other performance moderating factors such as stress, fatigue, and various types of individual differences; this general capability is expected to have broadcommercial value.  The underlying technologies for simulating and portraying human affect and behavior have significant spin-off potential to the entertainment industry (for games and movies).  Finally, these technologies could also be used to constructinteractive customer service and help systems for the Web and telephone.The progression described above also forms the core of an effective commercialization strategy.  With a Phase I demonstration in hand, and having initiated Phase II development, we will be in a position to market VECTOR in an expanding circle ofgovernment, then commercial sectors.  The spin-offs to mass-market education and entertainment sectors represent significant potential sales.",

        "abstract": "As Objective Force systems such as Future Combat System (FCS) and Objective Force Warrior (OFW) are fielded, the battlespace will feature increased lethality, reduced numbers of combat systems, reduced decision making cycles, and a shift from traditionallogistics planning/ execution to logistics distribution closely paralleling the Just-In-Time (JIT) logistics used in the commercial workplace.  High expenditures of precision munitions in the Objective Force environment, coupled with relatively lowinventories of the munitions will make FCS logistics a critical component of mission success.The ISB decision aid will be an answer to the problem of gaining and maintaining the logistics flexibility required for the Objective Force.  It will provide top to bottom logistics visibility for the Objective Force logistics structure, alerting andprediction of logistics problems, planning/replanning for logistics nodes and routes, and interact with other logistics and operations/planning systems for full mission integration of logistics.  ISB-DA is designed to dramatically increase throughput atall logistics nodes by decreasing uncertainties associated with logistics decision making due to incomplete information.  ISB-DA will be designed as a component which can fit easily into the ARDEC decision aiding reference architecture or GCSS-A, and whichwill be compliant with the Joint Technical Architecture-Army (JTAA).ISB-DA is an answer to the problem of limited visibility of logistics assets at all levels of the force structure.  Complete implementation of ISB-DA during Phase I and II of the proposed effort will take place within the context of the ARDEC CombatDecision Aiding System (CDAS) program.    The concepts and implementations will serve as a technical base for technology insertion into a number of Army Science and Technology Objective (STO) programs under consideration for Objective Force operations.The decision aid component can also be applied to civilian domains such as transportation, logistics management, and emergency management.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rh blood group phenotyping is required both before blood transfusion and to determine if potential Rh incompatibility exists in pregnant women. Normally the Rh phenotype is established by a hemagglutination test. However, a limiting factor with available reagents is that human IgG anti-Rh is unable to induce direct red cell agglutination. Although IgM monoclonal antibodies can directly agglutinate Rh-positive red blood cells, anti-Rh IgMs are frequently polyreactive and give false positives. In the Phase I SBIR application the investigators developed a novel human blood typing reagent consisting of a human IgM-like (polymeric) recombinant antibody containing the constant regions of human IgG and the variable regions of human anti-Rh monoclonal antibodies. The proposed polymeric anti-Rh IgG has been constructed and expressed in myeloma cells. This novel antibody is correctly assembled and secreted and most important: it directly agglutinates Rh-positive red blood cells. For the Phase II SBIR the following specific aims are proposed. First, to produce two formulations of polymeric anti-Rh IgG. Second, to determine the fine specificity and affinity of polymeric anti-Rh IgG. Finally, to compare the polymeric anti-Rh IgG with commercially available anti-Rh reagents. It is expected that the anti-Rh polymeric IgG will make Rh phenotyping faster, more accurate and less expensive.",

In Phase I, Clearant demonstrated the feasibility of applying a virucidal dose of irradiation to plasma for transfusion using the Clearant Process TM. On a commercial scale, this will be significantly less expensive than other technologies in development. Clearant proposes to develop methods of utilizing gamma-irradiation to inactivate viruses in single donor units of frozen plasma. The goal is to define and test parameters for irradiation of plasma on a commercial scale to inactivate at least 6xlogl0 of enveloped viruses and 4xlogl0 of non-enveloped viruses while retaining marker protein integrity. Protein recovery and activity will be measured using biochemical techniques. In vivo studies will assess acute toxicity, chronic toxicity, and efficacy of the irradiated plasma when compared to the non-irradiated control. Scale-up will involve preliminary screening of the plasma bag material and development of full-scale irradiation procedures at commercial facilities. Viral inactivation and stability studies will be performed at key milestones during process development. Blood banks will license the technology from Clearant, providing a significant commercial opportunity for all organizations while preventing the spread of viruses",

The purposes of the project are to develop technologies and tools that can automatically measure different behaviors in mice to reliably predict drug-induced changes in home-cage and locomotor behaviors, or measure behavioral responsivity to drugs of abuse or potential therapeutic agents. The main advantage of the methods for this proposal is that it will enable investigators to perform very complex and sophisticated analysis of home cage an locomotor behaviors that are almost impossible with today's technologies, and to conduct large scale screening tests to examine the effects of a wide variety of different drugs of abuse in mutant mice or rats. This technology will improve the quality, and alleviate the burden, of observing mouse behavior and achieve more objective and constant analysis. Once all the specific aims are accomplished, the developed methods will be able to facilitate and enhance research in animal models of addiction that use behavioral, neurobiological, pharmacological, and genetic approaches, and may serve the foundation of the Nation's investment in understanding the causes, consequences, and treatment of drug addiction.",

We will focus on three cancer-related symptoms: pain, fatigue, and emotional distress. These three symptoms were selected based on their prevalence among cancer patients, the association between these symptoms and reduced quality of life, and the availability of structured treatment guidelines for their clinical management. In our Phase I research we identified clinician and patient requirements for Cancer CareLink. We determined that patients and clinicians would be likely to use the Internet-based support system if it were shown to improve care. As a result of our Phase I efforts we believe Cancer CareLink will provide measurable benefits to patients and the providers involved in their care. The primary objectives of this Phase II study will be: To compare utilization, comprehension, and satisfaction with educational materials provided in the Cancer Care Link condition to those receiving usual care.  To compare perceived self-efficacy in self-management of cancer-related fatigue, pain, and distress in the Cancer Care Link condition to those receiving usual care; To compare characteristics of medical care in the Cancer Care Link condition to those receiving usual care. Patients attending outpatient oncology clinics of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center will be recruited. Consenting patients will be randomly assigned to receive Cancer Care Link (N=50) or to receive usual care (N=50) for three months. Patients in both groups will receive (1) an in-depth assessment at study enrollment, (2)educational materials, (3)weekly symptom assessments, and (4)an in-depth assessment at study completion.  Cancer Care Link patients and their clinical providers will also receive (5)visual summaries of weekly symptom ratings, and (6) treatment recommendations. Usage trends and usability evaluation of Cancer CareLink will be conducted. Functional usage distribution, average length of time spent on a function, average completion time of individual tasks and error rates in performing tasks will be evaluated.

Our efforts culminated in a multi-day demonstration in Yumawhere we successfully completed a series of autonomous flights that conclusively demonstrated the feasibility of our hardware and software architecture for use in small UAVs. In phase II we plan to continue development on the Piccolo system in order to addmore capability and flexibility to the system.  The development will pursue three main objects:1) Integration of improved sensor suite including MEMS gyros and 3 axis Magnetometer - This enhancement will facilitate extended operations in GPS denied environments; and improved flight control performance.2) Development of a Piccolo compatible generator and power conditioning system - This will facilitate extended duration operations and enhance our payload capability.3) Development of auto land and auto takeoff capabilities - With the additions of the upgraded sensors these important features can now be realized minimizing the need for skilled pilots. Initially the Piccolo II will be used as the primary flight controller on the AINS and SWARM UAV platforms. Target volumes for these vehicles may go as high as 10,000 per year.  While the Navy applications are themselves worthy market opportunities wefeel there are many other emerging applications where the Piccolo II's small size and reasonable cost will be an enabler.  These include civil as well as military reconnaissance, routine and targeted weather observations, and disaster assessment (forestfires, floods, and other inhospitable environments).  This feeling is based on the recent success of our Piccolo autopilot platform that has generated over $300,000 in product sales in the latter half of last year.  The feedback we've received leads us tobelieve that a more advanced system such as the Piccolo II will have many takers. Our current Piccolo customers, which include the Navy, Air Force, NASA, AAI, Titan Systems, Advanced Ceramics Research, and many university programs, are interested insimilar hardware solutions that leverage off of the existing Piccolo code base and development tools but have increased capability.",

        "abstract": "70540S02-II    High power microwave gyrotrons, needed to initiate fusion reaction, require microwave extraction windows with high thermal conductivity, low microwave absorption, and low resistance to thermal cracking.  Newly developed, diamond windows fabricated with Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) possess this combination of unique properties, but, thus far, CVD-diamond has proven to be an expensive and unreliable solution.  This project will develop a new CVD deposition method that provides for higher growth rates to lower the window costs.  Also, a non-destructive method will be developed for characterizing the diamond components to ensure reliability, both prior to and during operation in microwave-heated fusion and high power laser applications.  Phase I demonstrated feasibility by the successful deposition of a two-inch-diameter diamond window, which met the specifications of the gyrotron manufacturer.  An approach for developing a remote non-destructive technique to improve window reliability also was identified.  In Phase II, the window deposition rate will be increased and the deposition area scaled up to enable greater than the 1MW microwave transmission required for initiating fusion. A non-destructive technique, based on the resonant ultrasound response of the window to laser excitation, will be established for the remote detection of the window\u00bfs mechanical state, in order to warn of impending window failures.     Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  In addition to fusion research, the new diamond windows should benefit industries involved with large scale industrial microwave heating; CO2 laser metal cutting; and microwave sources such as gyrotrons and traveling wave tubes used by both the civilian and military sectors.",

However, extreme temperatures have caused equipment to fail during mission critical operations, especially with today''''s battlefields taking place inextreme climatic conditions. Cobra Design & Eng. along with its subcontractor SAIC have designed a Transit Case Thermal Management System (TCTMS) designed to fit standard transit cases capable of supporting COTS equipment ranging from 3U to 15U high. Thekey to the TCTMS is the use of thermoelectric coolers (TEC).   The fruits of our labor during the Phase I design has proven that the TCTMS will operate unattended while maintaining a specified temperature range. We have selected commercially availablecomponents that drive the TCTMS. We also found in Phase I that the TCTMS can be reconfigured to accommodate larger heat loads. Therefore, we are proposing a second Higher Capacity TCTMS in Phase II. We plan on subjecting our TCTMS units to a fullcompliment of tests including electrical, functional and environmental to validate it''''s ability to survive the most extreme military conditions.Cobra Design & Engineering intends to pursue the marketability of the Transit Case Thermal ManagementSystem with Electronic Enclosure manufacturers and electronic cooling products. Due to the lack of commercially available thermal control units which are self maintaining, the potential need for this product is evident and has been verified by suppliers ofelectronic enclosures. To pursue this venture Cobra intends to develop a catalog ready data sheet showing the TCTMS as a configurable unit and commercially viable product.

        "abstract": "Under the Phase 1 effort, we developed tools that allow us to define system performance when transmitter and/or receiver are installed on vessels underway.  These embody the basic physics of multi-static HF sea scatter and radar signal processing.  Thetools are used to study tradeoffs of performance vs cost, as well as constraints on vessel maneuvering during surveys.  The Phase 2 effort will examine the major risk areas confronting the successful completion of an operational system.  This includesdeveloping and demonstrating (by sea trials) the best possible algorithms to extract current maps from vessels underway. The advantage introduced by the ship velocity -- as shown in the Phase 1 Final Report -- is to spread the Bragg Doppler spectral regionthat contains current information into many bins instead of the few that result when transmitter/receiver are stationary (on shore).  This offers more bearing angle information that can improve accuracy.  Or, this phenomenon can be used in processing toreduce the time span over which the ship velocity must remain constant.  The position and velocity of the vessels carrying transmitter and receiver are known from GPS at all times. Hence, time series of these quantities can be exploited in any way thatproves effective in the removal of their induced Dopplers. Completion of this SBIR program will extend our present commercial coastal HF radar technology to allow surface current maps to be produced from vessels underway without the need for sites on apossibly hostile nation's shore.  A  strictly commercial application is the exciting prospect of using this technology on oceanographic survey cruises.  Our instrumentation, like ADCPs, ROVs, CTDs, and other marine observing systems, would be installed onresearch vessels used by universities and companies that perform surveys for the government and the oil industry.  Finally, it could satisfy a request we are frequently asked: can SeaSondes be put on cargo ships passing through narrow straits (e.g., theMalacca Straits leading to Singapore, the biggest port in the world) to map currents ahead and around the vessel as it navigates treacherous, heavily trafficked areas?",

        "abstract": "Wind estimation is a large component in the error budget for LCAC line-charge deployment during mine clearing operations. Currently, the Navy has no viable capability for measuring range and cross winds onboard an LCAC.  CTI proposes to develop a low-cost,compact, rugged, eyesafe laser wind sensor to meet the Navy LCAC measurement requirements.  This sensor will significantly increase the efficacy of LCAC mine clearing operations, resulting in considerable cost savings.  Phase 1 performance modelingsuggests that a low power (250 mW) sensor will be capable of range and cross wind velocity estimation precision better than 4 and 15 cm/s respectively, at a 1 Hz update rate.  System degradation by as much as 20 dB from fog, rain, sea-spray, etc. resultsin a measurement precision that still meets requirements.  In the proposed Phase II program, CTI plans to build and test a brassboard version of this sensor and demonstrate performance under simulated LCAC environmental conditions.  The low-cost,short-range sensor, developed in this effort, will provide 2 km high and 6 to 10 km wide dome coverage complementing CTI's long-range WindTracerr product line.  Cost reductions will be realized by leveraging significant ongoing activities to develop alow-cost wind sensor for clear-air-turbulence detection onboard commercial aircraft. The proposed program will result in the development of a low-cost, compact, eye-safe, air-cooled laser transceiver for short-range wind velocity measurements.  Thistechnology will have application in many military as well as commercial settings.  Potential commercial applications include general aviation wind shear detection, airport wind surveillance, and environmental monitoring.  Military markets include the LCAC,onboard wind sensing for military aircraft in the deployment of supplies (precision airdrop), as well as an onboard systems for gunships and helicopters to improve ballistics accuracy (ballistics winds).  Naval applications such as carrier glide-slopewinds, helicopter pad wind monitoring, and gust detection are also pertinent.",

        "abstract": "TACOM-ARDEC has demonstrated that high brightness lasers produce highly repeatable class III black powder ignition delay times in large caliber guns. However, for the laser igniters to displace conventional primers they must be compact, lightweight,efficient, robust enough for breech-mounting and provide lower life cycle costs.  Advances in laser technology are needed to meet these requirements and support deployment.  High power diode bars are efficient, but their poor beam quality (typical M2>1000from a 60W bar) is incompatible with the brightness requirement for ignition.  To meet the laser igniter requirements, CTI proposes an innovative, active beam-combining architecture, capable of dramatically enhancing the combined brightness (>300x) ofmultiple diode bars to generate near diffraction-limited output at multi-kW levels.  In order to maintain high brightness, the beam-combiner virtually eliminates thermo-optic beam distortions and is compatible with wide temperature band operation.  Phase Iproduced: (a) comprehensive modeling and engineering analyses, (b) proof-of-concept demonstrations to validate the proposed architecture, and (c) breadboard and brassboard preliminary designs.  Phase II will (1) deliver a compact kW-class breadboard laser;(2) support testing of the laser on a breech simulator at Picatinny; and (3) design a rugged, air-cooled battery-powered prototype of the laser to operate with recoil on the breech of large caliber guns.   CTI's proven ability to engineer rugged,electro-optic systems for high shock, vibration and temperature range environments provides leverage for a successful overall development program.Anticipated applications include (1) ignition systems for munitions and explosives, (2) high power laser foraerospace-platform missile defense, (3) low cost, active LADAR sensors for industrial and military markets (4) cost-effective laser sources for materials processing, printing, and medical applications.

The hypothesis is based on numerous previous studies that collagen surface enhances cell adhesion, proliferation and extracellular cellular matrix synthesis, all of which contribute to fibrogenesis and fibrous tissue deposition, resulting in stable aneurysm occlusion. In phase I, we have developed a collagen-based coil prototype and tested the prototypes in vitro and in vivo in a rabbit saccular aneurysm model. Results of the in vivo studies demonstrated the feasibility of embolizing saccular aneurysms using coils constructed from purified type I collagen.

During the early stages of separation, the analysis requires considering a unified booster/sustainer configuration with variable center of gravity and moments of inertia; while at later stages the analysis transitions to a more conventionaltwo-body problem.  The new code will be used to support CKEM separation design and evaluation studies including simulating separation tests at the CUBRC shock tunnel facility as well as planned flight tests.  In addition, the new code will be used toanalyze seeker window shroud separation and submunition-dispense problems.In addition to paving the path for supporting design/development activities for tactical systems and relevant separation events, this activity will lead to our ability to simulatevery complex stage separation events for other types of systems with fully coupled CFD/6DOF and plume chemistry and multi-phase effects.  This has significant commercial potential as related to a variety of design and systems studies which include:(1)   Separation analysis of the X-37 Space Shuttle;(2)       Separation analysis of the X-43 Hyper-X scramjet research vehicle;(3)   TBM separation event simulations supporting IR detection (IR spike); and,(4)    Launcher analyses and flyout with application to both Army and Naval missile launcher designs.This effort will expand the types of problems we can support and will enhance the commercialization of the specialized CFD codes we now license.",

CRAFT Tech will be supported by Seiner and coworkers at U. Miss who will obtain 3D PIV data for Mach .85 and 1.5 cold and hot jets to support model calibration. Acoustics data will also be obtained in this effort, and simulations performed via coupling the CFD solution with an acoustics analogy noise code (such as MGB) will be compared with this data.

Predictive methodology is deficient at these higher altitudes due to the complexity of the physics.   The proposed innovation serves to improve our ability to simulate higher altitude missile flows via extending newly developedhypersonic transitional models and hybrid continuum/DSMC methodology. In the altitude regime of 40-60 km, laminar to turbulent transition occurs within this separation zone. Extensions of 3D PDE's for kL (laminar fluctuations) and for G (intermittency havebeen incorporated into the CRAFT CFD Navier-Stokes code in Phase I, and will be extended to analyze plume/divert jet induced separated zones in Phase II. Above  60 km, continuum breakdown occurs and we will improve upon the slip regime extensions andhybrid DSMC coupling (using the DAC97 code) initiated in Phase I. Research will focus on developing advanced coupling techniques at the breakdown surface, thermochemical extensions, and on developing new particulate integration techniques. The resultanthybrid code will provide high fidelity simulations at altitudes up to and beyond 100 km. CRAFT Tech has played a leading role in supporting systems and developmental studies related to missile plume/divert jet interactive flows at altitudes up to about45km. This effort will provide for the extension of such activities to much higher altitudes permitting us to deal with a much broader array of problems. There is no high-fidelity CFD code that contains plume physics and addresses interactive issues andthe Phase II development provides us with a very unique tool. Particular areas where we see major commercialization potential include: (1) support of Army interceptor technology programs; (2) support of MDA/MSIC Boost Phase Intercept studies for detection,discrimination and plume to hardbody handover; (3) Liquid and Solid threat simulant booster design (for target usage) where we have been supporting a number of industrial groups; and (4) varied control jet interactions problems associated with small UAV'sand with space vehicles.",

Absence of equivalenttechnology for radiative transfer simulations limits radiative transfer analyses (for missile heating or IR signature studies) to single CPU simulations on structured grids. The proposed effort is rectifies this limitation by via the systematic development& validation of a novel unstructured grid technique for conducting radiative transfer simulations. The new model will employ hybrid multi-element grids and operate in a multi-CPU, parallel processor computational environment. The ability to performlocalized mesh adaption is a key feature of the new unstructured grid IR methodology. The developmental activities of the SBIR program will be accompanied by systematic validation against industry-standard IR methodology, using identical physics (bandmodels, atmospheric transmission, and scattering models). IR signature predictions will be demonstrated for several scenarios, e.g. tactical missile, threat ballistic missiles (TBM) divert jets on hypersonic interceptors, etc. Application to aircraft andhelicopter plume flowfields will also be conducted to assess geometrical versatility and overall fidelity of the new technique. A fully validated, efficient, unstructured grid capability for performing IR predictions will result from the proposedeffort.The technology development proposed is of direct relevance to Boost Phase Intercept (BPI) and will aid in assessing the potential of innovative hardware technology developments proposed for space and sea-based kinetic energy BPI concepts.

A novel strategy that combines a compressible and an incompressible flow solver is proposed, in which, the different regionsof the flow are computed using algorithms that are optimal for the respective regimes. Each flow solver will be validated in detail for the simulation of the respective regimes by comparisons with measurements at laboratory scale as well as full scale. Anunsteady turbulence model for the simulation of V/STOL flow fields is also proposed in which modern enhancements to Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) turbulence modeling will be incorporated into the solvers. Large Eddy Simulations (LES) of laboratoryscale flow fields will be used to develop and calibrate the unsteady model for the flow fields of interest. Finally, development of a strategy to interface the two solvers using a novel dynamical modeling technique that will reduce the computationalexpense is also proposed. Upon completion, this simulation framework will aid in the development of flight simulator models used in the integration of new aircraft units with air capable naval platforms.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Two million Fires annually kill and injure more than 27,000 people in the US. All other natural disasters (floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, etc) account for only a small percentage of those injured in fire every year and it is estimated that as many as 200,000-300,000 are actually injured in fire but the majority are not reported. Fire is the 5th leading cause of accidental death behind only motor vehicle accidents, falls, poisonings, and drowning deaths. In addition fire causes over $9 billion in direct damage and in excess of $100 billion in total damages. A significant decrease in both injuries and the monetary loss from fire has occurred over the past twenty years and this is credited in large part to the widespread use of smoke detectors. Smoke detectors and smoke alarm systems not only provide a means of reducing death and injury, but also allow for a quicker response to the fire, resulting in less damage. The goal of this research project is to develop a portable, inexpensive device for use by the hearing impaired community (approximate 22 million in the United States [Adams]) that identifies the audio signal from a smoke detector, a fire alarm horn or other emergency notification audio signal and then activates an alert mechanism capable of waking a deaf individual in all stages of sleep. The aim is for the devices signal recognition capabilities of the device to provide equal protection to this disabled population as that provided to the hearing able population as dictated in the National Fire Protection Association 72, National Fire Alarm Code. These concepts will be investigated in two distinct paths. The first path will further refine the auditory recognition capabilities of a signal identification algorithm developed in Phase I research to include nonperiodic smoke detectors and emergency alarm horns. The second path of this research involves testing deaf, hearing-impaired and hearing able individuals for their response to alert mechanisms. The objective is to determine the effectiveness of audible smoke detectors in waking hearing able individuals and use this information as a base line for deaf individuals response to tactile or visual waking devices. No research could be identified in the literature that links sleep stage monitoring and effectiveness of waking of emergency alarms. The goal of Phase II is to arrive at a suitable \"brass board\" prototype device.",

Hospitals, businesses, and small communities use gen-sets to help reduce costs by load leveling and provide emergency power during blackouts (either scheduled or unscheduled).  Recent power outages in California have led to large increases in the purchase of gen-sets, primarily for providing emergency power.  In addition to providing value associated with load leveling and emergency power, gen-sets have an added value in that they can be installed relatively rapidly.\n\nAlthough gen-sets are, in principle, under U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation, many of these gen-sets are being rapidly installed with minimal concern for EPA emissions and exclusively focus on providing back-up power to avoid blackouts.  The net effect of these events should be an increase in air pollutants (mostly NOx) as these gen-sets are brought online.  \n\nIn Phase I, Compact Membrane Systems, Inc.

This included:  (1) demonstration of 50 percent NOx reduction while having minimal effect on other pollutants, (2) fabrication of prototype membrane systems/devices for easy installation or retrofit into diesel generators, and (3) enhanced overall membrane/system performance to perform better even when only low turbo pressure is available.\n\nThis success has led to the active participation in the project of a major industrial gas membrane company, a major diesel generator company, the U.S. Navy, and a major university.  The participation of these groups will enhance Phase II and subsequent commercialization. \n\nIn Phase II, CMS will design and build full-size retrofit kits and install them on intermediate-scale diesel generators (e.g., 1,500 kw).  Working with their diesel generator partner, CMS will modify turbocharger operating conditions and engine operating conditions to reduce NOx emissions and have a minimal effect on particulate emissions.

        "abstract": "Modern Army vehicles require durable, reliable, modular and lightweight structures for better maneuverability and performance. Use of advanced composite materials with smart structural concepts offer the potential to meet these requirements. Design of suchstructures requires sophisticated analysis tools that are capable of predicting deformation and stresses accurately. In Phase I of the contract, damage models and computational approaches were developed and their use for accurate analysis of laminatedcomposite plates with embedded sensors/actuators was demonstrated.  The objective of Phase II effort is to develop, using Phase I results, a finite element software for Army engineers and contractors to use in the design and manufacturing of nextgeneration Army smart structural components. The specific technical objectives of Phase II effort are: the development of the nonlinear layerwise finite element model; the development of computational algorithms for the integration of damage models, smartstructural concepts; and global-local analysis using the layerwise and equivalent single layer theories; the development of a finite element computer program based on these concepts and procedures; demonstration of the software capabilities through anumber of relevant examples; and the development of strategies for commercialization of the software developed in Phase II. The software developed during Phase II effort may be used to determine 3D stress states, study damage growth, and monitor failuresin laminated composite structures. The results of Phase II can be commercialized by incorporating the developed software ideas into a commercially available finite element computer program, such as ABAQUS, marketed by HKS, Inc., Providence. Thecommercialization of the developed technology will benefit Army engineers and designers in gaining a fundamental understanding of the non-linear behavior and damage progression in thick composite and sandwich structural components used in Army vehicles.Consequently, the computational tools developed herein will have a significant impact on the analysis and design of composite structures used in lightweight composite army vehicles.",

The developed technique is based on cross-correlationsover the focal-plane-array measured signal intensity exchange between pixels sampling distant targets.  Work to be performed during Phase II includes both the extension of the analysis technique to more distant targets and the specific application tothreat cloud RV/RV-decoy discrimination.  Hardware-in-the-loop testing and analysis using the existing Thin Film Analog Image Processor (TAIP) spatial convolution engine is conjunction with our temporal image processing chips will proceed throughout PhaseII to validate our simulated results.  During Phase I, CDC explored the applicability of analog VLSI spatio-temporal filtering (STF) and pixel-on-target intensity modulation analysis of computed motion-energy to target identification based on measuredpixel modulations due to radiometrically accurate, conical fixed range RV micro-dynamics.  Our novel approach leverages the natural ability of massively parallel analog circuitry to perform important computationally intensive image processing tasks inreal-time, and therefore has potential for handling intercept engagements containing numerous targets. Phase I results indicate potential for distant detected target object identification, and guides our threat cloud discrimination approach.Early targetidentification capabilities using non linear motion energy image processing techniques integrated in analog image processors are ideally suited for compact, low power, military imaging applications.  Analog image processing technology may also beapplicable in may other commercial areas including automatic inspection, biometric identification, security, surveillance, and other machine vision applications.  CSC is fulfilling current DARPA and AIT sponsored contracts while aggressively pursuingpotential commercial opportunities for analog VLSI image processing applications.  The unique and powerful capability to perform massive convolution functions in real-time, in a small package and with low power requirements will enable a new generation ofintelligent systems not previously considered viable by systems and product designers.",

The approach is simple tomanufacture, rugged, and easy to retrofit into existing designs.  In Phase I, preliminary 2D simulations demonstrating concept feasibility have shown at least a 36% reduction in rotational speed at constant thrust and at least an estimated 4 db reductionin the total radiated acoustic power.  The proposed Phase II effort will design, fabricate, and water tunnel test a \u00bf scale technology demonstrator to provide a hardware demonstration of BDSP thrust enhancement and develop the necessary BDSP designtechnology for prototype development.  The proposed Phase II options will tailor the BDSP concept for the target torpedo platform with the design, fabrication and water tunnel testing of a prototype torpedo propulsor.  A key element of this prototype testis demonstration of potential acoustic signature reduction of the BDSP concept.  This prototype test will provide the engineering database for rapid Phase III transition of this technology to the Navy fleet. This BDSP concept can provide greatly increasedpropeller thrust for a given propeller diameter leading to both increased speed and/or maneuverability.  This technology has direct application to torpedoes, unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs), maneuvering thrusters, submarines, and other propeller drivendevices.  Alternately, this technology offers reduced radiated noise while maintaining current thrust levels through both reduction in propulsor rotation speed and acoustic cancellation, which has direct application to torpedo and submarine acousticsignature reduction.In addition, this thrust enhancement technology has much broader applications in the development of high performance axial pumps, fans and compressors, offering the potential for much higher-pressure ratio devices with a reduction in moving parts.

Li-ion cells that incorporated the new electrolytes could be repeatedly cycled at physiological temperatures to high charge potentials resulting in a significant increase in energy density.

For example, based on filter theory, the generalized sidelobe canceller selects the unbiased filterhaving minimum output power consistent with constraints.       We discovered a new problem formulation that provides an optimum solution with additional degrees of freedom.  For certain,specific choices of these additional degrees of freedom, the new solution reduces to known algorithms.  For other choices, our approachprovides new algorithms with added capability that allows multiple processing objectives to be met optimally and simultaneously.

The proposed architecture employs advanced polymer waveguide circuits and innovative electro-optic switchable gratings. Similar to electrical interconnectionbuses, where control and data signals can be relayed between senders (for example, processors) and receivers (for example, memories), the optical interconnect bus based on switched polymer waveguides is capable of providing the optical equivalent of anelectronic bus line driver.  In other words, for the first time on-chip high-speed signals (10 gigabits per second) can be reconfigured and transmitted to many receivers with a switching speed of 50 \u00bfs, which is 100 times faster compared tostate-of-the-art MEMS switching technologies.  Furthermore, broadcasting of high-speed clock signals can be easily achieved through waveguide fanout circuits.

The resulting jitter and beam walk results in a risk of significant performance degradation for the Acquisition,Tracking and Pointing, ATP beam train system.  As shown in Phase I of this effort, AFDF offers significant improvement in the jitter and beam walk performance of the ATP system.  The Spatially Distributed Sensing (SDS) techniques also developed in Phase Ioffer an additional performance enhancement to be investigated in Phase II. A blending of SDS with AFDF techniques showed promise in Phase I for further improving ATP performance.  SDS derived signals are coherent with the beam control jitter induced bythe respective modes and represent the dominate contributions of these modes.

It is clear that both high-throughput (HTS) and high-content (HCS) cell-based screening approaches will be critical in these efforts. To date, HTS and HCS have been separate processes due to the high speed of the former and the high information content of the latter. There is great market interest in integrating the two into a single process that would achieve HCS at HTS-like speeds. Oncosis has developed its LEAP instrument to meet this pressing need. LEAP additionally has the capability of laser-based cell manipulations via a targeted laser system, enabling a new generation of \"active\" (versus the current \"passive\") assays and screening procedures. This LEAP prototype formed the foundation for successful Phase I work to assess the feasibility of implementing HCS in a high-throughput manner (HC/HTS). The goal of this program is to now develop biologically relevant cell-based HC/HTS assays for the drug discovery market based on the LEAP instrument platform. Specific Phase II aims include: 1) LEAP instrument hardware integration with robotic plate handlers and dispensers to form an automated screening system; 2) development of control, image analysis, and database software; 3) development of a series of biologically relevant HC/HTS assays, including nuclear to cytoplasmic translocation assays, cell viability/proliferation, calcium flux, and neurite outgrowth; and 4) implementation of fully integrated and validated assays that are accessible to a wide spectrum of users. Successful completion of these aims will lead to a Phase III commercialization of the LEAP platform and will include new, unique assays that utilize the laser-based cell processing capability of the LEAP platform. LEAP should gain wide market acceptance as the first real HC/HTS platform, which is further capable of performing novel \"active\" assays to open up a new dimension in drug discovery.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Today, software for fitting logistic regression models to binary data belongs in the toolkit of every professional biostatistician, epidemiologist, and social scientist. A natural follow-up to this development is the adoption of exact logistic regression by mainstream biostatisticians and data analysts for any setting in which the accuracy of a statistical analysis based on large-sample maximum likelihood theory is in doubt. Cutting-edge researchers in biometry and numerous other fields have already recognized that it is necessary to supplement inference based on large-sample methods with exact inference for small, sparse and unbalanced data. The LogXact software package developed by Cytel Software Corporation fills this need. It has been used since its inception in 1993 to produce exact inferences for data generated from a wide range fields including clinical trials, epidemiology, disease surveillance, insurance, criminology, finance, accounting, sociology and ecology. In all these applications exact logistic regression was adopted because the limitations of the corresponding asymptotic procedures were clearly recognized in advance by the investigators and the exact inference was computationally feasible. But most of the time it will not be obvious whether asymptotic or exact methods are applicable. Ideally one would prefer to run both types of analyses if there is any doubt about the appropriateness of the asymptotic inference. However, because of the computational limits of the exact algorithms, investigators are currently inhibited from attempting the exact analysis. There is uncertainty about the how long the computations will take and even whether they will produce any results at all before the computer runs out of memory. The current project eliminates this uncertainty by introducing a new generation of numerical algorithms that utilize network based Monte Carlo rejection sampling. The Phase 1 progress report has demonstrated that these new algorithms can speed up the computations by factors of 50 to 1000 relative to what is currently available in LogXact. More importantly they can predict how long a job will take so that the user may decide whether to proceed at once or at a better time. The Phase 2 effort aims to incorporate this new generation of computing algorithms into future versions of LogXact.",

The objective of our Phase I SBIR effort will be to refine and verify this analysis on a larger image set. The objective of a subsequent Phase II SBIR effort will be to expand the method to enable differentiation among several distinct biological effects.",

The experiments proposed in this grant and the results from the Phase 1 study warrant the next series of preclinical studies needed to advance MX2060, or an analog toward clinical trials. The primary emphasis of the Phase II is the selection of an analog for development, and all aims are proposed to specifically address this goal. The isolation and characterization of the MX2060 binding protein will provide exciting opportunities with this compound's unique mechanism of action. MX2060, has certain unique features: its rapid induction of apoptosis, its effectiveness on cells overexpressing cell survival genes and in vivo therapeutic index, despite its effectiveness on quiescent tumor cells, all indicating a potential application to a broad range of cancers. Compounds derived from natural products have played an important role in drug discovery. This is especially true in the cancer field: at least half of the chemotherapeutic drugs currently in use are natural products, or natural product analogues. MX2060 potentially represents a completely new class of drug treatment for cancer and, therefore, may address the enormous unmet need for innovative cancer therapies.",

This novel low-cost digitizer exploits a unique 'flash capture' approach to analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion to achieve an exceptional combination of speed (>1GS/s), resolution (10 bits), and low power.  Fluorescence sensing measurement underlies an immense array of cutting-edge applications because it provides a sensitive and versatile probe into nano-scale behavior and properties. The project will develop a full-featured instrument-grade engineering prototype of the digitizer and integrate it into a portable demonstration instrument to showcase capabilities such as distinguishing biological or chemical agents by their spectral and temporal signatures.\n \nThis custom digitizer will match the capabilities of laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) to deliver accurate, cost effective, and complete data  collection. The digitizer will be the first low-cost compact digitizer suitable for the specific front-end LIF analysis of biological agents. Among the weapons of mass destruction that threaten people around the world, biological agents are  perceived to be the main hazard facing us today. The system's ability to capture more information, faster and more accurately will reduce the high occurrence of false alarms suffered by today's systems, resulting in a more reliable system with the potential to save lives.

The photoionization detectors (PIDs) that are widely used as gas chromatography (GC) detectors and hand-held organic vapor analyzers form a natural basis of comparison for the ArSLID concept.  The ArSLID uses a high repetition rate pulsed laser instead of a vacuum ultraviolet lamp to create molecular ions.  The prototype ArSLID built and tested in Phase I is approximately 10-times more sensitive, has ten-times shorter response time, and is several orders of magnitude more selective toward aromatic hydrocarbons than any commercially available PID.  The linear dynamic range is at least 5 orders-of-magnitude.  The ArSLID is also immune from interferences by water vapor or oxygen.   Technical improvements planned for Phase II include improving the resolution by 4 bits and correction for variations in the laser pulse repetition frequency.  Features will be added to facilitate easy integration of the ArSLID with existing GCs.  Another focus of Phase II will be applications development to show the versatility and value of ArSLID.  The Phase I work, which emphasized GC detection, will be expanded to HPLC detection, which opens up tremendous opportunities in the Life Sciences.  \n \n\nThe aromatic-specific detector will find a wide range of applications as the detector for gas chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), general vapor monitoring, and specialized environmental techniques.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project takes advantage of a powerful new coding technique called Group Coding (GC) pioneered in Phase I by Data Reliability Inc. (DRI), and an innovative storage system architecture called NetSTOR, to build a prototype for a highly available, reliable, high performance, application-friendly, and scalable network-based storage engine. The engine is multi-platform software that cost-effectively aggregates distributed islands of independent storage resources into a single virtual shared pool of storage. GC typically offers 6 to 27 times enhancement for encoding and 3.5 to 6.5 times enhancement for decoding. The NetSTOR approach is superior to commonly used data replication because it offers optimal redundancy leading to better resource (storage and bandwidth) utilization. NetSTOR is capable of aggregating the capabilities of multiple parallel storage nodes to get improved response times in both WAN and LAN environments. NetSTOR dramatically enhances the overall system throughput and exhibits perfect linear throughput scalability. \n      The NetSTOR engine serves as an enabling core storage technology. Applications can build on and benefit from the unique feature of this core. Many applications will exploit the competitive advantages of NetSTOR including storage virtualization, electronic software distribution, multimedia network-based services, modeling and simulation applications, data grids, document storage and delivery, distributed information retrieval, medical imaging, video on demand and terrain visualization. The GC technique pioneered by this project provides a new way of looking at and understanding existing array codes. This understanding will lead to the discovery of new codes and could result in significant scientific advances in coding theory. \nThe impact of Phase II is not limited to the technological and commercial merits. For this project, DRI is partnering with Jackson State University (JSU); therefore, the project will offer JSU students a tremendous educational experience. Since Jackson State University is an HBCU (Historically Black College and University), the project will set a precedent for continuous collaboration and will increase the participation of underrepresented and minority groups in science and technology.",

        "abstract": "Current information visualization (IV) techniques primarily focus on visual presentation of data. While these techniques aid human system integration (HSI) design, more advantageous designs may be possible with multimodal information perceptualization(MIP). This new design concept displays information through multimodal (e.g., visual, auditory and haptic) channels, thereby expanding current IV concepts. By capitalizing on a user's available information processing areas and accounting for varying tasksdemands, particularly in time-critical C2 environments, MIP design holds great promise. This Phase II effort will take the MIP design guidelines identified in earlier work (Phase I) and integrate those pertinent to C4ISR environments into an interactiveMultimodal Information Design Support (MIDS) system that provides intelligent HSI advice to multimodal system designers. To further optimize manning of C4ISR systems, it is critical to assess capabilities of warfighters, and identify individuals with thehighest capacity for multimodal information processing. The proposed work includes development of a Tool for Information Processing Capacity Assessment (TIPCA) of individual warfighters, which will provide objective assessments of individual informationprocessing capacities.  Together, these two tools (MIDS and TIPCA) will enable designers to provide enhanced human/system integration with C4ISR environments through efficient multimodal display design and appropriate manning allocation.  Development of aninteractive, multimodal information design support system and a tool for information processing capacity assessment to aid designers in assessing and modifying multimodal human-computer systems offers wide utility to the HCI design field in general and tomilitary system design in particular.  These tools will allow not only evaluation of current C4ISR-type systems in terms of SA and information overload, but will also provide design guidance for new systems which are in a concept development stage. Inaddition, the products from this research extend beyond system design to also focus on the operator's ability to succeed in a complex, time-critical multimodal information environment. By combining validated system and operator assessment tools, designerscan enhance human/system integration of C4ISR systems and create a more streamlined, efficient work environment.The proposed MIDS system and TIPCA could be employed for C4ISR tasks performed in diverse training systems, hence facilitating design simplification and procedural consistency for military training systems.  The estimated market size for a productresulting from a funded Phase III effort is in the range of $1.5-$3.0 million, based on comparisons to other design software in the HCI field.",

In order to have little variance in first strike statistics contamination needed to be eliminated from the surface. This was accomplished with phase 1 research. During Phase 2 the primary objective is to manufacture a circular array of multipliers that operate with consistent electrical characteristics from unit to unit. Three areas in the process will be focused on in order to obtain this consistency. One important process to be investigated is the hydrogen reduction process, which is needed to maximize the amount of semi-conducting lead on the glass surface. Another process that needs to be addressed is the wet chemistry performed both before and after the hydrogen reduction process so that the proper formation of silica occurs on the surface.

Embryonic differentiation pathways are highly conserved among vertebrates. The Xenopus laevis embryo is an established toxicology model with ease of chemical exposure. Inter-laboratory studies demonstrated the reliability of the Frog Embryo Teratogenesis Assay-Xenopus (FETAX). Xenopus microarray analysis holds great promise as a versatile tool for drug screening and mechanistic studies of environmental toxicology. Our long-term goal is to develop Xenopus microarrays, categorize environmental toxicants according to their gene expression profiles and discover markers of environmental contaminants. About 18,500 EST clones were obtained from NIEHS. Initial studies completed in the Phase I with about1,200 clones demonstrate the feasibility of using Xenopus microarrays to identify genes responsive to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in early embryogenesis. In the Phase II, we will develop high-density cDNA microarrays and identify genes regulated by 7 classes of toxicants. These results will be utilized to produce diagnostic subarrays. We will also produce interspecies extrapolation chips to study conservation of gene regulation by toxicants. In addition, the feasibility of use of X. laevis chips for a X. tropicalis genetic manipulation study will be explored.",

        "abstract": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: Fumonisin, Aflatoxin, and DON Vomitoxin are mycotoxins produced by mold and fungus and found in seeds and grain products. Grain mycotoxins affect human health, animal health, and commodity value. Fluorescence Polarization (FPA) diagnostic technology provides an efficient way for grain producers and processors to check mycotoxin levels prior to shipment or final food processing. Diachemix uses FPA technology since it is quicker and easier to perform than other diagnostic technologies. FPA tests are performed in minutes, and require fewer steps, procedures, and materials than other methods. FPA uses a homogeneous format with none of the incubation or washing steps of heterogeneous diagnostic technologies. FPA is a quantitative assay performed in a field setting or in a central reference laboratory. Advanced lab technician skills are not necessary for FPA technology. FPA diagnostic technology has long been used in the human clinical market where it has proven to be both safe and effective. This project advances the development of FPA for mycotoxin detection (including Fumonisins, Aflatoxins, and Don vomitoxins) in grains and other grain products. FPA technology allows more efficient testing for mycotoxin levels by grain producers and processors. FPA detection tests are rapid (usually performed in minutes), easy to perform, and less expensive to perform than other detection technologies. FPA is a quanitative technology that can be performed either in the field, at the grain processing facility or central reference laboratory.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children and fourth in middle-aged man. Malignant gliomas remain uniformly fatal underscoring the urgent need for new, more effective treatments. More effective therapies coupled with improved imaging information would provide important opportunities to improve care and individualize treatments. Results from pre-clinical studies funded by the Phase I award using a direct injection of BCNU dissolved in ethanol (DTI-015) have revealed significant therapeutic efficacy compared to systemic delivery of BCNU. Moreover, recent results obtained from two clinical Phase I/II trials by Direct Therapeutics, Inc. have generated a great deal of excitement for the use of DTI-015 for the treatment of malignant brain tumors. A significant limitation of the DTI-015 formulation is that  The toxicity of the absolute ethanol limits the scope of its applicability to solid, small (3-4 cm) well Circumscribed tumors in humans. In an effort to treat larger as well as disseminated, infiltrating malignant gliomas, we propose to investigate the use of alternate drug delivery vehicles, which are proposed to have reduced toxicity and the potential to deliver BCNU over a larger tissue volume. In this Phase II proposal, we will use a rodent glioma model to optimize the BCNU formulation to achieve maximal delivery and therapeutic efficacy. Phase I award results demonstrated a tumoral transient vascular collapse after administration of DTI-015 that may play a significant role in the efficacy of the agent due to the retention of BCNU within the tumor tissue. The ability of alternate vehicles to induce this vascular collapse without toxicity resulting in an improvement in therapeutic efficacy will be investigated. The proposed studies will be facilitated through the use of noninvasive serial magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate the dynamic distribution of the solvent vehicle as well as the therapeutic effectiveness by diffusion weighted MRI. The use of MRI will prove beneficial for subsequent translation of an optimized formulation into clinical trials.  Although the present study is focused on the treatment of brain tumors, the successful local treatment of this disease would motivate future clinical trials to other tumor sites including breast, prostate and pancreas.",

The non-radioactive assay was able to identify inhibitors of protein kinase C, and was adapted to screen small molecule libraries against a proprietary orphan serine/threonine protein kinase in collaborative studies with Chiron. To demonstrate the full utility of this assay, in this phase II SBIR grant, we propose to employ our assay to screen a small molecule library for inhibitors of two therapeutically important serine/threonine protein kinases, IkB kinase and beta-adrenergic receptor kinase which are targets for the development of drugs to treat cancer, inflammatory disorders and tolerance development and for which no drug screening assays are currently available. We propose to develop a novel assay to \"measure the compartmental translocation of protein kinases to identify drugs that could impede selective functions of individual protein kinases without inhibiting their active site. Accomplishing these goals will allow us to provide a portfolio of assays for protein kinase drug discovery that we will commercialize to pharmaceutical, biotechnology and functional genomics companies.

        "abstract": "This effort will develop a rapid application development and virtual prototyping tool that automatically generates reusable object oriented source code for use in safety critical avionics display systems.  Object oriented development will reducedevelopment costs, program schedules and risk for new rotorcraft displays and will increase safety through a reduction in software defects.  A user friendly development environment will allow a wide range of design/development professionals to participatein creating these systems.  This technology will dramatically reduce development costs for related systems by promoting content reuse throughout the lifecycle of an avionics or embedded display program.  Training simulations for operational and maintenancepersonnel, both free standing and CBT applications, as well as interactive manuals will benefit from direct reuse of design efforts utilizing industry standards MISRA C, DO-178B, and OpenGL.  This tool will produce C/C++ - OpenGL graphics source code,allowing further cost reductions by leveraging low cost COTS graphics chipsets common in desktop and gaming systems.  Interfaces within the tool will promote traceability using automated requirements tracking and certification systems, which willdramatically reduce the development and certification costs incurred by current processes.  This effort will leverage successfully commercialized technology developed during a previous SBIR effort.The benefits to the Army from this SBIR will prove to besignificant in the years to follow.  The benefits will come from the improved communication, design and reuse of the engineering effort between the various professionals involved in the lifecycle of an embedded system graphics development program (e.g.Rotorcraft Displays).  Among these benefits is a dramatic reduction in the continuous redevelopment that many avionics programs suffer as each design team (e.g Human Factors and Subject Mater Experts, System Architects, Embedded Software Developers,Instructional Content Developers) re-implements representations of the same systems in different development environments.  The current industry environment often sees three or more redevelopments of essentially the same display systems as a programprogresses from concept to deliverable.  By developing and extending the GL Studio reusable object framework with an embedded run time library, the same design will be able to be used from initial prototype to the flight ready product.The GL Studio tool set, which DiSTI developed as part of a previous SBIR, was designed with just such a diverse user group in mind.  GL Studio is already being used by several human factors groups in the design of Rotorcraft Displays, including PM UtilityHelicopter in the APEX Lab at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville. By leveraging this prior effort, DiSTI will be able to focus on the integration of these tools into the engineering environment used by the avionics industry, thus making what was a series ofdisjoint `stove-piped' efforts into a more collaborative environment. This process starts with conceptual designers and human factors professionals and takes their efforts directly to the embedded software professionals and beyond to the post deploymentsupport of simulation and training applications.  In each of these settings, the same design content will be utilized with a variety of targeted code generation capabilities that support the appropriate levels of the DO-178B process using industrystandards for graphics software development.  The cost savings realized from improved inter-disciplinary communications alone makes the price of this SBIR worthwhile.Within this SBIR, DiSTI will perform a two part effort which will dramatically reduce costs in the development of avionics displays.  The first part will be a closer and more automated integration of the development of these displays with the processesoutlined in DO-178B.  This will reduce the administrative expenses related to requirements tracking and certification of these display systems.  The second part will focus on the development of a targeted avionics code generation capability which bridgesthose personnel involved in design and functional analysis of a system into the actual generation of the safety certified source code that goes into a finished display system.  The resulting content will not only be ready for the deliverable system butalso have a dramatic cost benefit to the documentation, simulation, and training efforts that follow as each of these can be supported from the same code generation environment used by the avionics engineering team.When approached with this tool set and the concepts put forward in this SBIR, several of this industry's major players stated that the successful completion of this effort would be extremely useful to their development effort.  One of the leadingdevelopers of avionics, Rockwell-Collins, is a partner in this proposal and will be mentoring the effort.  Several other companies have provided endorsement letters to the effort, which have been attached to this proposal.",

Cellobiohydrolase could be an effective enzyme for the efficient breakdown of lignocellulose, but little effort has been expended on improving the technical efficacy of this class of cellulases, either by harnessing natural biodiversity or by using directed evolution technologies.  In this project, highly active naturally-occurring cellobiohydrolases will be identified and characterized in order to identify the best candidate for hydrolysing lignocellulose.   In Phase I, high-throughput methods were developed for the screening of large numbers of variants of a single cellobiohydrolases, in order to find mutants with improved technical efficacy on lignocellulose.  In Phase II, a discovery program will be implemented to identify the most active cellobiohydrolases in biomass samples collected widely from the natural world.  Following biochemical characterization, directed evolution will be used to further improve the activity of the leading candidate on lignocellulosic feedstocks relevant to the production of renewable fuels.

The objective of this researchproject is to continue development of new closures using materials which will enhance the lightweight properties of CB protective clothing and equipment applications.  Phase I technology, product drawings, data guides and prototypes of novel single pullclosures demonstrated that lightweight closures,  medium in size range, offering a minimum of 145 lb. crosswise breaking strength, lower slider operating force, seam tape capability at 5 lb. min. peel resistance, are easily interfaced with light weight CBfabrics and are responsive to CB needs.  Phase II will demonstrate that the Phase I prototypes and concepts satisfy the performance requirements through application to CB end items.  Phase II will pursue advanced developments to offer means to open theclosure systems through the addition of a separating mechanism,  from either end by way of a second engagement mechanism and multiple sliders to enable two-way closed operation. The closure system technologies and designs will be down selected, fabricatedand integrated into a controlled live agent testing  and demonstration test bed.The entire military CB protective community has voluminous uses for an effective closure system that increases utility.  Protection equipment potentially includes gas masks,covers, gloves, hoods, clothing items, coveralls, Selectively Permeable Membrane suits and the ability to attach CB protective jackets to the trousers using a multiple slider, separating closure.

        "abstract": "DTI has developed an integral, variable geometry airfoil for helicopter rotors that will modify the leading edge camber, or droop, through a continuous change in airfoil contour during a revolution. In Phase I, DTI designed and prototyped several versionsof LEEMA (Leading Edge ElectroMagnetic Airfoil), a variable geometry airfoil. In Phase II, DTI will build and test a full-scale LEEMA system(s) on an OH 58 blade, at full rev, in a stationary spin pit to assess its aerodynamic performance and capabilities.In Phase III, DTI will work with a commercial helicopter manufacturer to transition this technology into military and commercial rotorcraft.Army rotorcraft are being called upon to operate in much more demanding environs than in the past, particularly inareas of nap-of-the-earth (NOE), deep-penetration, and air-to-air combat. Highly maneuverable, agile, and survivable rotorcraft demand greater aerodynamic capability from the rotor system. The performance of a conventional, fixed shape rotor is primarilylimited because of compromises resulting from the conflicting design requirements of the advancing and retreating blade. LEEMA uses electromagnetic actuators distributed in the flexible and fixed structures of the airfoil to modify the leading edge camber,or droop, as the rotor changes its position between retreating and advancing. The actuator elements are specifically designed to function in the high g environment of the rotating blade. The additional leading edge camber has the potential to increase themaximum lift coefficient by up to 30%, thereby substantially increasing the available lift capability of the rotor and reducing or eliminating the dynamic stall problems inherent in current rotorcraft. LEEMA has the potential to improve maneuverability,aerodynamic efficiency, and increase cruise speed with relatively modest electrical power and weight increases. Successful development will result in widespread application throughout military and civilian rotorcraft.",

        "abstract": "70736S02-II    The Next Generation Linear Collider (NLC) requires significant numbers of klystrons and pulsed power supplies for operation.  The baseline klystron design requires pulsing at 500 kV, which leads to significant losses in the pulsed power supplies, representing $40 \u00bf $100 million or more in electricity costs over a 10 year NLC life.  A gridded sheetbeam klystron that eliminates the 500 kV pulsing and associated power losses is being developed as an alternative to this baseline klystron.  However, the new klystron will require a fundamentally new approach to powering the sheetbeam klystrons, one that places significant demands on the two hundred foot cable that is envisioned to connect the power supplies and fast grid pulsers to the klystrons.  This project will develop high voltage cables that will meet the NLC sheetbeam klystron requirements and be affordable in the large quantities required for construction of the NLC itself.  Phase I conducted the required analyses and tradeoffs of the cable and connector design, materials, construction methods, and performance to arrive at a manufacturable cable design.  Phase II will iterate and finalize the cable design, and manufacture representative samples.  These cables will be tested and assessed for performance, reliability, and cost, and a cable design will be selected for full scale prototyping.     Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The new cable should contribute to a large reduction in the operational costs of the Next Generation Linear Collider.  At the same time, this design would enable a more cost-effective physical configuration of the NLC power system, thereby, reducing construction and maintenance costs.

Increased modulator efficiency will be critical to cost effective operation because each percentage of increased efficiency is worth millions of dollars in electricity cost savings over the NLC's operating lifetime.  Current efforts to develop a reliable and cost effective design are based on commercially available switching elements.  However, these devices are designed primarily for electric motor drives and are not optimized for pulsed power applications.  This project will develop very fast, insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) configurations specifically suited for pulsed power applications.

The decreased manufacturing cost associated with each configuration was determined, and the Life Cycle Cost impact of that configuration on the overall NLC program was estimated.

        "abstract": "Since the adoption of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) electronics in military systems, most new ship electronics operate at 60 Hz in common with commercial equipment. Navy systems such as the Tomahawk cruise missile and the ADCAP Mark 48 torpedo, stilloperate at 400 Hz. These weapons systems could be redesigned to operate from ship power at 60 Hz, but the non-recurring-engineering and qualification costs would be substantial. This SBIR effort is focused on developing and qualifying a more cost-effectiveapproach: a low-distortion, quiet, efficient, and reliable 60 Hz to 400 Hz Weapon Power Converter (WPC).  The complete Weapon Power Converter comprises a 60-Hz-400-Hz frequency converter, auxiliary DC-DC power supplies, and operational controls.Phase I demonstrated the power electronics and controls required for the WPC. In Phase II, DTI will build prototype and First-Article WPCs, and demonstrate the full electrical and mechanical design. Changes resulting from testing will be incorporated intoa First-Article WPC, which will be environmentally-qualified under the Phase-II option. At the end of Phase II, we will have fully-qualified the WPC, with drawings suitable for in-house production. The production WPC will be highly reliable, with anexpected MTBF of 8.7 years of continuous operation, based on MIL-HDBK-217F.BENEFITS: The power converter technology developed under this SBIR has significant applications beyond the specific submarine weapon system for which it is being developed. High power switching with very low harmonics and noise is needed in other militaryand commercial power control applications, high frequency, high speed motors, and high-voltage utility power conditioning.This technology provides a cost-effective and `clean' solution for frequency conversion between 50 and 60 Hz, and military and commercial aircraft needs.The technology developed under this SBIR, in conjunction with DTI's high-voltage switching technology, is applicable to a wide range of commercial and military power-conditioning and control applications, including power factor correction, VARcompensation, and Flexible AC Transmission Systems.",

The new software will significantly improve the reliability of PCR and will enable high-throughput PCR applications resulting in significant cost savings. Three specific aims will be performed: Aim1: OMP Core Development. An evolutionary algorithm will be added to allow optimization of the choice of primers for multiplexing, temperature cycling protocol, [Mg2+], strand concentration, and choice of enzyme. New functionality for simulating the kinetics of PCR hybridization and polymerase extension will be added to OMP. This module will allow for the time course of the reactions that occur during PCR cycling to be accurately modeled so that the product distribution at the end of the thermocycling is accurately predicted. Aim2: Develop a generalized graphical user interface (GUI) and internal functionality for PCR in different formats. The GUI will be configurable for many different PCR formats, and this proposal will focus on finishing the functionality required for multiplex PCR, gene synthesis, real-time PCR, and mismatched primer PCR. Aim3: Experimental studies for kinetics parameterization and validation of OMP for multiplex PCR and other formats. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and stopped-flow kinetics will be used to perform a systematic study of the kinetic constants for duplex formation, target unfolding, mismatch discrimination under different conditions, and several different sequences will be performed. To validate the predictions of our software for PCR primer design, we will perform a carefully designed series of single target and multiplex PCR reactions.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   \nThe goal of this Phase II proposal is to complete the development and demonstration of a novel gradient coil suitable for human head Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at fields from 1 to 8 T with substantially higher performance than is currently available. The coil will be capable of continuous field gradients in excess of 80 mT/m on all axes with slew rates up to 400 T/m/s at improved efficiency. The gradient coil will be switchable between a configuration optimized for functional MRI (fMRI) using Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) and one optimized for high-gradient techniques such as high-resolution diffusion-weighted microscopy MRI (DWI). Compared to state-of-the-art head gradient coils, the novel force-canceled \"crescent\" gradient coil will have twice the continuous gradient capability, 25 Db less acoustic noise, and reduced nerve stimulation at higher slew rates. The coil will enable a substantial improvement in image resolution and/or imaging time on MRI scanners by all manufacturers. DWI, fMRI, and ultra-fast 3D gradient-echo angiography techniques will become widely practical. DWI has shown promise in the detection of acute ischemia within minutes (hours before it is seen in T2-weighted images); and ultra-high-field DWI has demonstrated order-of-magnitude advantages in resolution in white matter and nerves, owing to the diffusion anisotropy of the myelin. High-field DW EPI permits complete brain scans in under 0.1 second with adequate resolution for real-time monitoring of brain function, but it is not currently generally practicable because of gradient coil limitations.  \n  \nThe Phase I comparative simulations and analyses (electromagnetic, thermal, and acoustical) of virtually all known head gradient coil designs showed substantial advantages of the novel design. The head gradient coil was manufactured and assembled to permit preliminary bench testing and analysis, which confirmed the feasibility and manufacturability of the novel coil design. All of the Phase I objectives were met or exceeded.  \n  \nThe Phase II effort will demonstrate the performance of the gradient coil in imaging experiments in a 3 T Siemens whole-body magnet at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in collaboration with Dr. Jerome Ackerman (Harvard Medical School) and complete the product development and optimization. Early in the Phase II, the coil completed during Phase I will be field-tested. A second-generation head gradient coil, primarily with improved manufacturability, will then be constructed and tested. The FDA approval process will be initiated near the end of Phase II, and marketing, manufacturing, and licensing discussions will be pursued with Siemens, GE Medical Systems, Magnex, and perhaps others.",

Its unique features will include high vacuum (10-11 Torr), low peak field (55 MV/m, for the survivability of an activated GaAs photocathode), and emittance-compensating solenoids (to allow the polarized electron beam to achieve this low emittance of 0.6 -1.0 mm-mrad, for charge per bunch of 1-2 nC).  Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of a polarized electron PWT photoinjector.  Beam dynamics simulations showed that excellent beam quality can be achieved by operating the PWT at a low accelerating gradient, and that the possibility of back bombardment of field emitted electrons onto the photocathode is greatly reduced.  The vacuum design and the load lock design were completed.  Phase II will fabricate and test a PWT photoinjector with an activated GaAs cathode, integrated with a load lock for the photocathode.     Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  In addition to its potential as a polarized electron source for future linear colliders, a high vacuum PWT photoinjector should find use in high brightness light sources such free electron lasers, 4th generation synchrotrons, and Compton x-ray sources for applications in medicine, industry and research.",

        "abstract": "In this Phase II program the technical capability for titanium tank tracks to provide a lightweight solution meeting the demanding service conditions for medium weight armored vehicles will be proven, building upon the technical feasibility demonstrated inPhase I.  In Phase I preliminary wear test results of samples produced using powder metal titanium technology showed the technical feasibility of particle-reinforced titanium composites (MMCs) to meet the demanding wear resistance needed for trackcomponents such as center guides.  Detailed weight models of titanium track designs demonstrated the potential of reducing the track weight 25-40% versus steel.  In Phase II, this enabling titanium powder metal manufacturing technology will be employed toproduce hardware for center guide wear testing and subsequently optimized design and manufacture center guides for field testing using production vehicle platforms.  Center guides have been selected as the critical test component for structural and wearoptimization using finite element analysis, component-specific manufacturing development, and finally vehicle field-testing.  The Phase II results will be applicable to all track systems requiring a weight reduction and will target Phase III validation forcommercial implementation in systems such as a lightweight tracked version of the Future Combat System (FCS), AAAV or Interim Armored Vehicle (IAV).  In addition to the center guide, this lightweight high wear resistant material has direct application inautomotive powertrain systems and to suspension components, thereby permitting similar weight reduction of wheeled vehicles. A lightweight tank track that incorporates titanium alloys and wear resistant titanium MMCs will provide benefits in tankmaneuverability, facilitation of deployment, and reduction of operation and support (O&S) costs.  By demonstrating the capability of the titanium MMCs to meet the demanding wear conditions used in service, track designs incorporating this technology areexpected to find application in track components of medium weight vehicles including the Future Combat System (FCS), AAAV, M109 Howitzer and the Crusader and suspension components of wheeled vehicles.  This technology can be applied to numerous othermilitary and commercial components.  The combination of lightweight and wear resistance, coupled with strength, stiffness and toughness (at room and elevated temperature) will also offer advantage for wheel vehicles (LAV, FMTV, AND HMMWV) and enginecomponents (e.g. piston pins and connecting rods).",

Current standard inoculum production techniques are expensive, involving the field pasteurization of substrate, inoculation of this substrate with an appropriate fungal strain under aseptic conditions, and monitoring of the inoculum during a grow-out period of 4 to 6 weeks. Preliminary and Phase I SBIR work demonstrated that a novel alternative to standard inocula, referred to as pelleted inoculum, is effective at supporting fungal colonization and pollutant degradation at a significant cost savings compared to standard inocula. However, before pelleted fungal inocula can be used in fungal-based remediation on a commercial basis, successful demonstration of the technical and economic feasibility of large-scale pelleted inoculum production and application are required. The purposes of this project are to identify appropriate equipment for the large-scale production and bagging of pelleted inocula and to demonstrate that pelleted inocula are technically comparable and economically superior to the use of standard inocula in pollutant degradation.

By recruiting specific proteins to the inner membrane, signal cascades are then initiated leading to downstream effects such as protein sorting, tumorigenesis, regulation of exo-and endocytosis, control of cell shape, cell migration and proliferation, and apoptosis. Discovering new PIPn specific lipid recognition proteins (LRPs) has become important in yielding new potential targets for drug discovery.  Biochemical investigations on lipid selectivity have begun to employ protein overlay lipid blots, colloquially termed \"Fat Westerns\", with nitrocellulose-immobilized PIPns. The converse approach would employ a lipid overlay with gel-separated proteins. Thus, in Phase I, we employed a liposome overlay system for identifying PIPn binding proteins immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane using traditional PIPn-containing liposomes (PIPosomesTM). In addition, we developed a set of novel PIPn-containing polymerized liposomes named PolyPIPosomes TM. For several of the PIPn headgroups, we also investigated the use of PolyPIPosomes TM for detecting lipid-protein binding interactions.  In Phase II, we propose to extend the methodology to include all eight PIPn scaffolds and perform stability studies. In addition we will further explore applications for PolyPIPosomes TM where regular liposomes have previously been used in basic research applications and in high throughput screening.

        "abstract": "In 1991, the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services called lead \u00bfthe number one environmental threat to the health of children in the United States.\u00bf  Lead exposure can cause premature birth and impair a child\u00bfs mental and physical development.  In adults, lead exposure can cause kidney damage, high blood pressure, and other problems.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that 12,000,000 homes exceed the new 400 ppm standard for soil lead in play areas.  Soil lead at small arms firing ranges, manufacturing plants, and other government and industrial sites poses similar challenges. \n\nA promising alternative to excavation and replacement of lead-contaminated soil is phytoremediation, whereby living plants remove lead from firing ranges, industrial sites, and residences.  Phytoremediation relies on crop species and chelators that facilitate higher plant uptake rates.  The annual cost of chelators can range up to $20,000 per acre.  Furthermore, sites with sandy, well-drained soil may need a water-impermeable liner to prevent slowly degrading chelators such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid from leaching metals into groundwater.  Costs of a liner can double the total cost of phytoextraction, rendering phytoremediation impractical for certain sites.\n\nIn this Phase II project, Edenspace Systems Corporation seeks to demonstrate the use of transgenic plants that exude significant amounts of a rapidly biodegradable chelator\u00bfcitric acid\u00bffrom their roots, enabling a cost savings of more than 70 percent in lead phytoextraction.  A citrate synthase (CS) transgene was placed under the control of different plant promoters to overexpress the gene in roots.  In Phase I, 100 lines of CS-transgenic tobacco, Nicotiana tabacum, were created and tested.  Preliminary results with five hemizygous strains are promising, suggesting that higher-performing homozygous strains created at the end of Phase I may hyperaccumulate lead from soil (bioconcentration factor >1).  Significantly, little soluble lead remained in the soil, indicating that the plants may successfully address leaching concerns.  In Phase II, the highest performing transgenic lines will be demonstrated at a small arms firing range in Maryland and a residential site in Massachusetts.  Phase II objectives also include concentrating lead in harvested plants to facilitate disposal or recycling, and mating transgenic lines of a proven lead-accumulating plant species, Brassica juncea. \n\nAt many sites, applying rapidly biodegradable citric acid precisely at the root/soil interface where metal uptake occurs may eliminate the need for expensive chelating agents and liners.  Attainment of the project\u00bfs goals therefore may reduce the substantial public health hazard of soil lead by realizing phytoremediation\u00bfs low-cost potential.",

        "abstract": "The overall objective of this Phase II SBIR project is to develop and demonstrate a 1 kW man-portable multi-fueled thermophotovoltaic (TPV) power system.  The TPV technology is based on a grey body (silicon carbide) emitter, resonant mesh infrared bandpassfilters, and GaSb photovoltaic cells.  These key components have been developed on previous programs.  The approach to achieving this goal is to draw from both the component and systems experience gained on several preceding programs to design, fabricate,and test a 1 kW test bed TPV system.  The results of evaluation tests performed on the test bed system will guide an iterative process of three additional improved design, fabricate, and test cycles that will culminate in the demonstration of a rugged,stand alone 1-kW portable system weighing less than 50 lbs. and operating at diesel fuel to electric efficiency of 12% or greater.The benefits of this technology to the U.S. military is a light weight, silent, efficient power system that runs on highenergy density diesel fuel.  These power systems will be enabling for many missions.  Commercial applications include small portable, quiet power supplies for home, recreational vehicles, marine, and remote site applications.  The technology also lendsitself to a hybrid solar concentrator heated system that can run on either sunlight or fossil fuels to produce 24-hour power.  The applications of such is for distributed power systems serving residential, agricultural, commercial, and light industrialusers.",

However, they are more difficult to atomize and combust, and the presence of the gelling agent can cause aloss of specific impulse.  EERGC Corporation in cooperation with subcontractor TRW, a leader in gel propellant technology, proposes to identify promising particulate gallants for use in MHZ and/or DMAZ bipropellant fuels and to optimize them with respectto chemical stability, gel stability and properties, rheology, combustion performance and cost. The Phase II program will continue the screening and experimental evaluation of candidate gellants and gel formulations, ultimately establishing the most viablefor detailed study. The selected fuel gel will undergo (1) rheological characterization over a broad range of shear rate and temperature, (2) scale-up of the production process with quantitative assessment via a statistical characterization of performanceon four quality control tests (density, syneresis, yield stress, and viscosity at 12,000 s-1), and (3) engine testing to establish combustion performance. A preliminary cost study will also be performed. These experiments will establish the viability ofthe new fuel gel for operation in bipropellant systems with existing IRFNA oxidizer gels.The gel fuels to be developed in this proposed SBIR project will be suitable for integration into Common Missile and modernized Hellfire program applications.  This isapplicable to a number of missile systems such as TOW, Javelin, Hellfire, and potentially Stinger-type systems.  In addition, gel propellants' potential for enhanced safety and control make them appealing for NASA launch vehicles, spacecraft, andsatellites as well as future commercial spaceflight applications.",

There are many roughened-metal formats (colloids, films, electrodes, etc.) by which the SERS measurement can be made; every researcher has modified a Raman instrumentto accommodate their particular SERS experiments.  There is no existing spectroscopic system fully optimized for SERS analysis and with sampling flexibility to accommodate all metal formats.

The Phase I program evaluated and determined an appropriate spectrograph and determined the optimum angles of analysis for a fiber optic-based SERS system.  In addition, weevaluated the effects of substrate angle with respect to an aerosol stream for maximal adsorption.  In the Phase II program, we will fabricate a complete prototype that will be a full range, high resolution SERS spectrograph capable of 1) field orlaboratory use and 2) using any desired SERS substrate representation through modular sampling accessories.Small and inexpensive Raman instrumentation will bring new commercial applications of the method, including quality control analysis, processcontrollers, forensic instruments for identifying illegal substances, and air and water monitors.",

In Phase I, using new synthetic methods for semiconductor nanoparticles we prepared a selection of broad band absorbing monodisperse (1-10 nm diameter) particles of several candidate semiconductors and evaluated their opticallimiting behavior in comparison to polydisperse C suspensions. A multiwavelength nanosecond characterization facility was established at EIC with capabilities of measuring between 225 nm to 1625 nm over six orders of input fluence. Several newnanocrystalline systems were identified that provide substantial advantages over prior art for broadband protection. Phase II will entail adding improved automation and imaging capabilities to the instrumentation, synthesizing an expanded group ofnanomaterials and size distributions, developing the concept of sensitized nanocrystals for wide dynamic range optical limiting, and developing solid matrices for creating filter elements with a low damage threshold.The new filters have government marketsfor eye protection of military personnel, including individual eyewear and inclusion in sights and periscopes, as well as for sensor protection in terrestrial and satellites imaging systems.

The vehicle is a star structured polymer having lipophilic and hydrophilic segments to promote both encapsulation of poorly soluble drugs and solubility of the complex in physiological fluids. In an aqueous environment the star polymer forms a \"unimolecular micelle\", which shields the encapsulated drug from the outer environment. The stability of the unimolecular structure will minimize early degradation of the encapsulated drug, decrease harmful side effects from premature drug release, and facilitate site-specific drug targeting to selected tissues. Each micelle will have an identical structure and molecular weight that will promote uniform drug loading levels and a predictable, well-controlled drug release rate. The specific aims in the Phase II program are a) to synthesize a range of star polymer structures to develop structure-property relationships, b) to use these structures to develop and optimize the drug encapsulation process for the model anticancer drug etoposide, and, c) by in vitro and in vivo testing at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, determine whether incorporation of anticancer drugs into star polymer micelle enhances therapy of cancer tumors.",

The objective of the Phase I effort and Phase II proposal is to use compliantstructures technology to design and test a hinge-less, variable camber, semi-span, leading-edge for rotor blade dynamic stall control utilizing monolithic structures.  Significant aerodynamic and systems benefits are possible through the integration ofcompliant smart structures technology into modern rotorcraft.  Phase I results have shown that a variable camber compliant structures rotor blade can be designed which will provide a significantly enhanced performance envelope for the rotorcraft in theform of increased speed, payload, maneuverability, and range as compared to traditional designs.  The new compliant structures design will alleviate retreating blade stall with a robust and reliable variable camber leading-edge system. The new system willbe lightweight, rugged, maintainable, damage tolerant, and have a low radar cross-section, all while providing significantly enhanced performance. The commercialization potential for advanced, high performance helicopter blade airfoils, designed with areliable and robust variable camber leading-edge is excellent.  It is recognized that future rotorcraft are expected to play an increasingly important role in military operations in the form of long range transport, low altitude deep penetration, andair-to-air/air-to-ground combat.  The rotorcraft industry will be eager to exploit the advantages of the variable camber compliant structure based design.  This new design approach will deliver the advantages sought by rotorcraft designers, but with muchlower weight and much lower cost of manufacture, while providing a robust and reliable system.

The drive for compact electrical systems, reduced weight, and increased heat dissipation has taxed theElectrical Engineer. A prominent area requiring technology advancement is treatment of Printed Wire Boards (PWB) to provide environmental and EMI protection.    Traditionally, polymer based conformal coatings are used to seal and protect PWB's fromenvironmental exposure with metallic enclosures added to provide EMI shielding. An industry target is to enable the conformal coating to provide the EMI protection as well. The maturation of carbon nanotube technology is enabling such a multifunctionalcoating. In Phase I, Eikos demonstrated the use of carbon nanotube additives to achieve EMI shielding of 40dB in a standard conformal coating resin. The resulting multifunctional coating is entitled Nanoshield\u00bf.  The small amounts of carbon nanotubesrequired for Nanoshield\u00bf have minimal effects on base coating properties and cost. Nanoshield\u00bf has demonstrated compatibility with commercially available conformal coatings and application equipment.  Eikos with Northrop Grumman support proposes a phase IIprogram to demonstrate a multifunctional coating and implementation plan to reduce mass, volume, and cost of advanced electronic systems. Imparting EMI shielding to conformal coating eliminates the need for metallic enclosures integrated into PWB.  Thiswill significantly reduce the size and weight of electronic systems.  Achieving this goal will result in smaller computer envelopes, more payload capability of aircraft, and more effective cooling of densely packed electronic systems.",

The mechanical sensors are the weakest link in the controlsystem in terms of reliability and parts and maintenance costs, especially in demanding environments. For linear motors in particular, the position sensors are problematic since maintaining good resolution over long travel distances is both costly andphysically challenging.  Previous work on sensorless control has focused on rotary motors yet still has not adequately addressed applications requiring wide speed range and repetitive transient operation. Little work has been done on linear motors whichpresent additional challenges due to nonlinear end effects.

Simulation and experimental techniques will be systematically applied to develop sensorless linear motor control that addresses transient performance, wide speed operating ranges, and changing external loads typical of an EMALS aircraftlaunch. Effective sensorless control technology for rotary and linear motors would benefit large volume markets such as automotive by reducing the cost of electric motors in vehicles and reducing maintenance costs.

The goal of the proposed Phase II work is to complete development of a novel discovery technology, referred to as the TargetArray, which allows all bacterial essential gene targets to be screened simultaneously, in mixed-culture format, with an array of highly sensitive whole-cell assays. The foundation for this technology is a proprietary collection of Staphylococcus aureus strains constructed at Elitra Pharmaceuticals, each engineered to under-express or over-express individual essential gene products, in its current proof-of-concept form, this collection consists of 169 strains that down-regulate target gene products as the result of inducible expression of target-specific antisense (AS) RNAs. These AS expressing clones address approximately 80% of the broadly conserved essential gene targets known by Elitra to exist in S. aureus. To comprehensively address all essential genes of S. aureus, and to enhance the resolution of the TargetArray as a tool for identifying target-specific mechanisms of growth inhibition, we propose to supplement the AS-based collection with promoter-replacement (PR) constructions that achieve either under-expression or over-expression of specified target genes. These constructions will be engineered into S. aureus using a novel gene-manipulation method developed under Phase I funding for this grant. This method allows efficient integration of regulatable promoter cassettes by recET-mediated recombination into S. aureus target genes propagated in E. coil on bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs). Return to S. aureus by electroporation, followed by chromosomal integration and resolution, provides a very rapid means for recovering the desired constructions. Under Phase II support, we will construct and validate approximately 200 PR strains and carry out full-scale screens with the completed TargetArray using the Elitra synthetic compound library. Chemically attractive hit compounds demonstrated by the TargetArray to have whole-cell, target-specific inhibitory activity will be advanced into lead-optimization chemistry and evaluated for pre-clinical development.",

The goal of the proposed work is to develop novel antifungal drugs that are safer and more effective than those currently available.  The work will focus primarily on the dimorphic yeast, C. albicans, which is by far the leading cause of both life-threatening systemic fungal infections and more commonly occurring topical infections.  A distinguishing feature of the drug-discovery strategy the applicants are pursuing is that it is based on target discovery, target prioritization and screening, all conducted with the pathogen itself, rather than with a surrogate model system.  This strategy has been enabled by gene-identification and screen-configuration technologies developed at Elitra Pharmaceuticals, including important technologies developed under Phase I funding for this program.  Under Phase I, an expression vector system was constructed that will allow screening for dominant-negative phenotypes.  No such tools existed previously for C. albicans.  Screens for dominant-negatives will identify new drug targets in C. albicans and help annotate essential physiological pathways in this important fungal pathogen.  Critical functional features of the expression vector system have already been validated, a C. albicans complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) library has been constructed in the vector, and pilot screening for dominant-negatives is in progress.  Under Phase II funding, the investigators propose to implement the screen more broadly, characterize and prioritize the targets that are identified and conduct screening for drug leads.  The dominant-negative phenotypes of the newly identified targets will be used to develop primary or secondary cell-based assays to screen chemical libraries for potential antifungal drugs and to facilitate the characterization of hits identified through other screening strategies. The proposed Phase II work will complement and enhance the value of internally funded target-identification and screening efforts at Elitra and will help promote the discovery of badly needed therapeutic agents in a medical area that generally receives insufficient attention from the pharmaceutical industry.",

        "abstract": "70498S02-II     Activated-carbon-supported metal catalysts offer the most energy-efficient, active, and selective performance available for a large number of industrial oxidation and hydrogenation processes.  Unfortunately, the carbon supports suffer degradation during operation, that drastically limits operational life and operating temperatures, and adversely affects catalyst performance.  This project will develop advanced heterogeneous catalysts for industrial hydrogenation and oxidation reactions.  The catalyst technology is based on noble and semi-precious metals supported on novel, surface-modified activated carbons that have been hardened and cross-linked to produce a highly porous, monolithic structure.  Phase I developed two new catalyst preparation techniques, resulting in physically stable, activated-carbon-supported metal catalysts.  These materials were tested at bench scale for application to the terephthalic acid (PTA) purification process.  Catalyst characterization, testing, and applications support were provided by major industrial partners, each of whom has identified this technology as having significant potential in a number of processes beyond PTA production.  Phase II will develop catalyst manufacturing techniques for producing Porous-Solid-Carbon-supported catalysts for use in both fixed bed and batch reactors.  Process tests will be performed to quantify catalyst performance, and a pilot-scale test system will be manufactured to support process economics studies.    Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The technology should impact three of the four major catalyst market segments.  In particular, the market for PTA, currently the 11th most abundant chemical produced in the U.S., could result in $6-8M in catalyst sales yearly.",

        "abstract": "Reverse osmosis water purification units (ROWPUs) are essential to the Army  for providing clean water during combat and humanitarian duties.  The Army's ROWPUs are designed to treat any water source encountered in the world, therefore reverse osmosis (RO)membranes must be effective under a wide variety of rigorous feedwater conditions.  State-of-the-art polyamide RO membranes used by ROWPUs have low tolerance to disinfectants such as chlorine, a situation  which leads to either rapid biofouling or filterelement degradation.  The objective of the proposed program is to develop a new polyamide membrane that has significantly enhanced resistance to chlorine degradation and biofouling for use by the DoD and the private sector in ROWPUs.  Efforts will also bemade to increase the mechanical integrity of the membrane to resist delamination during filter pressurization/depressurization cycles encountered with intermittent use.  The Phase II program will focus its efforts on designing, synthesizing, andcharacterizing new polyamide materials that form semipermeable membranes using standard fabrication procedures.  New materials will be incorporated into composite RO filtration membranes and be performance tested.  The anticipated results are thedevelopment and production of polyamide composite RO membranes with greatly enhanced performance and longevity for use in spiral wound filter elements.Successful development of RO membranes with superior chlorine tolerance and mechanical stability can save tens of millions of dollars for DoD and industry by significantly reducing the field distribution logistics, equipment down-time, maintenance time,and costs associated with water pre- and post-treatment and frequent replacement of degraded and fouled membranes.  RO membranes developed in this program will be fabricated into spiral wound filter elements for immediate use in existing RO filtrationsystems such as the Army's ROWPU field units, industrial water and byproduct recovery systems, public utility water purification/desalination plants, and residential water purification units.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will continue developing a method for incorporating Single Walled Carbon Nanotubes (SWNT) into nylon to act as reinforcement. Their incorporation will be achieved by wrapping the SWNTs with a functionalized polymer that interacts with the SWNTs mechanically, but is not chemically bound to them. The polymer will be chemically bound to the nylon and in this way will act as a load transferring conduit between the nylon matrix and nanotubes in the final composite. How well the polymer transfers the extraordinary strength and durability of the carbon nanotubes to the nylon composite will depend on how well this new interface, between the SWNT and the nylon matrix, functions. For nylon fibers, the degree to which it is possible to align the SWNTs along the major axis of the fiber filaments will play a role in the fiber's thermal and electrical conductivity as well as strength. The primary focus of this work is to optimize the SWNT/nylon matrix interaction in order to obtain the best load transfer properties. Methods to align the SWNTs along the long axis of the nylon filaments in order to maximize fiber strength will also be investigated.\n\nCommercially, this high strength nylon composite will have significant applications in the aerospace industry for use in fabricating lightweight, retrievable, satellite launch vehicles, reusable space craft etc. The military will also be interested in this technology because of the combination of exceptionally high strength, lightweight and stealth capability. The successful development of this technology will result in new lightweight thermoplastic composites that have extraordinarily high flexural, tensile and impact strengths and can be easily molded into any shape desired. This new technology will eventually be applicable to many other materials. Additionally, since these composites are thermoplastics and not a thermosets, they will be more easily recycled.",

        "abstract": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: Filtration membranes in the dairy industry for milk and cheese whey processing are to be cleaned and disinfected every 24 hours. Typical filtration plants for large-scale dairy processing have hold-up volumes of 1000-2000 gallons requiring large volumes of cleaning solutions and large quantities of chemical cleansers. Reducing cleanser cost and the environmental impact of spent cleanser discharge, especially chlorine and chlorinated byproducts, will benefit the economics of dairy processing and reduce chemical hazards to the environment. Additionally, filtration membranes are easily damaged by chlorine whereas they are tolerant to much greater levels of hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide also auto-decomposes to water and oxygen making it environmentally benign. However, the cost of hydrogen peroxide traditionally exceeds that of chlorine or hypochlorite. The electrolytic technology in this program will produce hydrogen peroxide solutions consuming water, electricity, and oxygen from air for a fraction of the cost of bulk sources making its use an economically viable alternative to chlorine. The automated system based on this technology will generate cleanser solutions effective for cleaning and disinfecting filter membranes used in dairy processing at a fraction of the cost of bulk cleanser concentrates. Cleanser solutions will be generated on-site at the proper concentrations minimizing the use of bulk chemical concentrates. This system will be interfaced as an add-on to the current clean in place cleanser distribution systems used to maintain filter plants.",

Between 1/4 to 1/2 of the $ 27.3 billion in direct diabetes in-patient medical expenses is used for the treatment of foot ulcers. There is clearly a significant unmet medical need for a cost-effective, efficacious treatment for diabetic foot ulcers. The long-term goal of this project is to provide a novel treatment for diabetic foot ulcers, E-Matrix (TM). E-Matrix (TM) is a bioactive hydrogel designed to mimic the open polar structure seen in early fetal development. Treatment of chronic wounds in pre-clinical studies and in a 6 patient feasibility study demonstrated its ability to stimulate healing of chronic ulcers. This project will further support the commercial development of E-Matrix (TM). The Specific Aims of this project are to: (1) demonstrate the safety and efficacy of E-Matrix (TM) for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers in a 60 patient randomized, controlled Pilot Clinical study; (2) develop validated physical-chemical analytical methods to characterize the raw material components and fully formulated E-Matrix (TM) and link these properties to its biological activity; and (3) determine E-Matrix (TM) effects on specific gene activity important for the healing of chronic wounds using in vitro cell models and analysis of clinical tissue samples. The clinical study will examine the effect of up to 4 E-Matrix \n(TM) injections on ulcer healing during 84 days of follow-up with a 6 month examination to determine if healed ulcers remain closed. The physical-chemical analysis will use FTIR and SEC-MALLS to determine the extent and nature of interactions within the co-polymer and rheology to examine the physical properties of E-Matrix (TM) . Gene expression studies will use real-time PCR to quantify changes in relevant gene expression. Completion of these studies will provide the basis for the next important step in the commercial development of the E-Matrix (TM), submission and approval by FDA of a Pivotal Trial for diabetic foot ulcers. Successful completion of the Pivotal Trial will ultimately result in submission and approval of a PMA for E-Matrix (TM) treatment of diabetic foot ulcers.",

This project will develop a compact device to condense and separate the natural gas liquids from water and re-pressurize the resulting dry gas so that it can be transported through a pipeline to the point of use.  The device will have no moving parts and will utilize centrifugal forces in the flow.  In Phase I, an integral separator was analyzed and designed for both a subsea resource and an offshore resource, provided by a major oil and gas company.  A compact unit with no moving parts was designed, which satisfied the producer requirements for dew point, water removal, and pipeline pressure of the dry gas.  The use of a seed liquid to maximize liquids production and separation was analyzed and found to be feasible.  Phase II will develop a commercial prototype integral separator, which will be tested in a natural gas testing facility and demonstrated in a commercial gas production facility.    Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  Commercial applications should include offshore gas production, subsea gas production, and the production of stranded assets that were previously uneconomic to produce.",

This system will be efficient, modular, scalable and adaptable so that the current and future needs ofthe military can be met. If successful, this will offer a unique approach to thermal management, which could improve fuel economy, reliability, serviceability and emissions.Today's coolant system consists mainly of a mechanically driven pump, mechanically driven fan, melting wax thermostat, and an aluminum fined radiator with ethylene glycol coolant.  These technologies have remained virtually unchanged for over 75 years, yetmodern day engines have advanced significantly in almost all other areas. Over 30% of all energy generated by the engine is dissipated in this antiquated thermal system. Properly implemented, fuel savings of up to 10% could be achieved by operating athermally optimal engine and decreasing parasitic losses. Additional benefits could include improvements in packaging and flexibility, which could decrease inventories, improve serviceability and allow for task specific control. This will be extremelyimportant as the military moves to a more lighter, more fuel efficient, mobile force.Phase I was used to evaluate candidate technologies and develop concepts for this advanced thermal management system.  It also involved analysis and math models to determine an optimal system and estimate the potential benefits. Phase II will include thesystem development and a proof-of-concept demonstrator vehicle. This will be used to perform head-to-head comparisons between a conventional and an advanced thermal management system.Properly implemented, this advanced thermal magement system will offer fuel savings of up to 10%.

        "abstract": "This Phase II SBIR proposes the development of technology that will lead to smaller, lighter and more cost effective power amplifiers for driving the highly reactive loads presented by active sonar transducers.  Following EAI's Phase I effort, and takingadvantage of new developments in state-of-the-art, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) class-D audio amplifier modules, EAI proposes to incorporate efficient matching and protection networks with COTS amplifier modules, and optimize these units for sonarapplications over a wide frequency range.  Recognizing that for low frequency applications, matching/tuning magnetic components can become the largest volume/weight/cost contributor to a sonar amplifier, EAI will continue the development of an innovativecircuit topology using high frequency rectification (HFR) to accomplish low frequency energy transformation by novel means.  To allow stable amplifier operation under dynamic loading conditions, for example in multi-element arrays, EAI further plans tointegrate motional feedback control strategies to provide velocity control.  Each, or a combination of these approaches, have the potential to realize substantial size, weight and cost reduction in sonar amplifiers, while maintaining high overallefficiencies and reliability.   The proposed Phase II effort addresses three areas of interest for the Navy.  Compact, wide-band, moderate power sonar amplifiers can be implemented using the latest generation class D audio amplifier modules. For lowfrequency applications where size of magnetics matching/tuning elements becomes large, EAI's High Frequency Rectification (HFR) amplifier approach offers the potential of substantially reducing the size of the components. Finally, the addition of velocitycontrol will allow for effective driving of closely spaced, multi-element transducer arrays where mutual coupling can cause problems with conventional amplifiers.  In all these applications the anticipated benefits include reduction in size and weight,reduced cost, improved efficiency and reliability, and improved control and stability.  Non-military applications of the proposed amplifier technology would be in commercial sonar applications. Additional applications include power distribution and poweramplifier systems, control actuator driver circuits, high power modulators for communications and ultrasonics applications such as industrial cleaning and food processing.  There are also a number of emerging biomedical applications for high powerultrasonics, including hemostasis and cancer therapy.",

One path involves developing and testing novel piezoelectric pipetting, dispensing, sensing and housing technology and integrating this into a fully automated piezoelectric pipetting system. Innovative piezoelectric-based technology enables pipetting of sub-nanoliter volumes of fluid and continuous monitoring to detect clogged tips and other operational states. The other path involves doing cancer-related genomics research in collaborative studies with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (F.H.C.R.C.) to use the proposed piezoelectric pipetting system to 1) develop more robust oligonucleotide or cDNA-based microarray platforms for gene expression analyses, 2) complete the development of a cDNA microarray-based platform for simultaneous genotyping and gene expression monitoring and 3) develop novel, high-throughput DNA microarray-based assays of cellular function that will make it possible to assay phenotypic effects of silencing specific genes on a genomic scale. On the one hand, the molecular-biology research provides a real-world application to help focus the design of the piezoelectric pipetting system and validate its performance. On the other hand, the system provides the enabling technology in terms of reliability, speed, experiment design flexibility, spot reproducibility and density to make the cancer genomics and functional genomics related research feasible. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to have the two paths come together, resulting in a fully functional and tested general-purpose, automated, piezoelectric, fluid pipetting system with the reliability and performance to empower cancer related, genomic and functional genomics research.",

The proposed computational model will address fuel-air ratio and temperature non-uniformities and fluctuations at the combustor and 1ststage high pressure turbine exit planes based upon actual JP-8 fuel chemical kinetics. A reduced chemical kinetic model will be developed using a detailed JP-8 chemistry mechanism and implemented into the combustor computational model. The proposedcomputational combustor model will also address secondary combustion in the 1st stage high pressure turbine. Steady-state as well as transient operational effects upon high fuel-air ratio fluctuations, chemical species dissociation and recombinationreactions, maximum temperature rise and fluctuations, pattern factor, and film-cooling reactivity will all be predicted in an efficient manner. The proposed combustor computational model will be capable of identifying the impact of various operatingparameters through detailed parametric studies, which can not be accomplished by the conventional multi-dimensional CFD codes. It is therefore anticipated that the proposed combustor computational model will become, once validated, an integral part of thehigh fuel-air ratio combustor design cycle. It is anticipated that the proposed high fuel-air ratio combustor computational model for development in this SBIR will be an integral part of current and future high fuel-air ratio combustors and turbine filmcooling design methodologies and database. In addition, the proposed model will quickly identify the critical design and chemical parameters that impact the high fuel-air ratio combustor designs.

The prototype software developed during the Phase I project provides the framework for this development. The input required by the system consists of: (1) the digitized representation of multiple layer short-axis and long-axis magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the heart, with and without radio frequency tissue-tagging; (2) noninvasive, digitized carotid artery pulse pressure obtained at the bedside or invasively obtained pressure through intracardiac catheter (IC). This information is compiled as MRI-based 3D geometrical data sets, 3D myocardial displacement data sets, and calibrated systolic loading data sets. The output from the system is directed toward two separate clinical solutions: (1) global and regional left ventricular stress calculation based upon a finite element solution utilizing patient-specific left ventricular geometry and the corresponding intracavitary loads; (2) left ventricular regional strain characterization based upon regional determination of both quantified circumferential minimum principal strain and minimum principal strain vector determination at baseline and during low dose Dobutamine (viability) and high dose Dobutamine (ischemia/myocardial infartation) infusion. The completion of the Phase I activities resulted in a prototype software package designed to interact with MRI data sets allowing clinicians, who wish to utilize the unparalleled power of advanced engineering analysis in making difficult therapeutic decisions, to have that information presented in a user-friendly format. The aims of the Phase II project are: (1) the further development of the capabilities of the prototype software; (2) its integration with the Unix-based MRI imaging data acquisition system currently utilized by the research institution to produce a stand-alone clinical tool; (3) the analysis of patient data to determine normality ranges of the information obtained from the Strain and Stress analyses to provide the necessary guidelines for the effective utilization of the tool. Software that would enable a noninvasive regional analysis of biventricular function would be combined with other software (some of which is already available) to enable coronary arterial and valvular imaging, providing the most comprehensive cardiac analysis package available.",

It will provide to the operator of handheld landmine detection systems a virtual experience for training that combines a minefield with realistic sensor signalscorresponding to actual target signatures. Providing direct feedback to the operator, it will stimulate performance enhancement, support operator training and reorientation to a new environment, and allow experimentation with operator cueing formats.Ultimately, we envision a high fidelity, effective training simulator that complements the Hand-Held Standoff Mine Detection System (HSTAMIDS). The proposed team of ETI, Duke University, and Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) participated jointly in thePhase I effort that successfully demonstrated the concept using electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensors. The Phase II effort will include the fused combination of EMI and ground-penetrating radar (GPR). The system uses real-time video tracking technology,that ETI has implemented in the deployable Sweep Monitoring System (SMS), and realistic audio-visual feedback. When the operator is using the virtual minefield, the simulated detector generates a realistic audio response characteristic of a detectoroperating in an environment with actual buried mines. This program leverages research already undertaken at CMU and Duke University, as well as ETI, a defense contractor, to insure success from laboratory development through technology transition andcommercialization.Since the software driven minefield will be able to emulate any common sensor response, it will transition rapidly to the commercial market because it will be highly effective in training the demining personnel on current land mine sensortechnologies and will significantly enhance their performance.  This commercial market is expected to be an order of magnitude larger than the military market, resulting in a significant dual use capability.",

Currently, only limited typesof arrays such as 256 X 256 Si:As are available in this spectral region. However, these extrinsic detectors suffer from several fundamental limitations, such as low quantum efficiencies, relatively low detection sensitivities and low operatingtemperatures. Intrinsic detectors made from HgTe/CdTe superlattices (SLs) have several advantages over them, including lower noise, higher operating temperatures and higher quantum efficiencies. The cut-off wavelength of HgTe/CdTe SLs can easily be tunedto the VLWIR by adjusting the layer thickness of the HgTe layers. This results in greater cut-off uniformity than that achievable by controlling the alloy composition of bulk HgCdTe. Another important advantage of HgTe/CdTe SLs compared to bulk HgCdTeincludes the ability to achieve p-type doping without high temperature annealing. Furthermore, these SLs can be grown on Si substrates, which would pave the way to megapixel hybrid or possibly monolithic VLWIR FPAs. Through the design of HgTe/CdTe SLelectronic band structures and device properties, and in-situ control of layer thickness, we proposed the growth of high quality SLs for the fabrication of high performance infrared detectors with cut-off wavelengths between 20-25 microns and operatingtemperatures above 40 K.",

        "abstract": "There are several key components to making efficient high performance TERFENOL-D actuators and sonar projectors. TERFENOL-D being a magnetically driven material requires magnetic materials and circuit design considerations.One of the principle considerations in a TERFENOL-D actuator is the lamination of the drive rod assembly to minimize eddy current generation. It has not been well investigated the performance trade-off between lamination thickness and performance of thetransducer. This study will develop a relationship between lamination thickness and predicted transducer performance. These models will be used to calculate performance trade off studies and cost impacts.Alternative production methods and materials used for the lamination of TERFENOL-D rod assemblies will be investigated to find lamination technologies to increase the electrical isolation between TERFENOL-D laminae. The appropriate material will alsoenhance production processes to further reduce the cost of producing TERFENOL-D drive assemblies.Control of the magnetic flux energy within a magnetostrictive transducer is a critical component in the design of a magnetostrictive actuator. Advanced soft magnetic materials will be evaluated for magnetic material properties and near net shape formingtechniques. These materials can become a notable cost component in the production of a TERFENOL-D actuator. Methods to reduce costs will be evaluated.New TERFENOL-D composite materials currently under development in other programs will be evaluated for applicability to naval sonar and other applications. Composite TERFENOL-D has the potential to produce near net shape TERFENOL-D drivers that can operateat frequencies above 100kHz. These composite TERFENOL-D drivers also have the potential to produce very inexpensive driver assemblies.BENEFITS: The final goal is to decrease the cost of TERFENOL-D transducers by a justifiable reduction in theinter-laminate resistance specifications, use of new TERFENOL-D materials, improved bonding and manufacturing techniques used in production of both TERFENOL-D and soft magnetics and additional research into new and improved Giant MagnetostrictiveTransduction Designs.",

        "abstract": "70838B02-II    Dielectric wakefield acceleration is presently being studied intensively as a promising technique to provide efficient and cost effective high gradient acceleration of electrons for next generation linear colliders.  This project will develop an experimental scheme to enhance the efficiency of dielectric wakefield acceleration by up to a factor of 4, compared to conventional collinear wakefield accelerators.  In particular, a ramped, multibunch Dielectric Wakefield Accelerator, for increasing the efficiency of energy transfer from, the accelerating structure to the accelerated electron beam will be designed, developed, and demonstrated.  In Phase I, the ceramics to be used in the accelerating structure were manufactured, and the required mechanical tolerances of 3-10 ?m and uniformity of dielectric properties in the range of 0.35% were achieved.  A 13.625 GHz accelerating structure (dielectric permittivity of 16 and loss-factor in the range of 1-1.2 x 10-4) was fabricated and tested, and a prototype laser beam splitter was installed to produce a ramped bunch train of 4 bunches.  The laser multisplitter was refined to provide control of the intensities, and ramped bunch train parameters were simulated and optimized for the accelerating structure.  Phase II will complete both the engineering design and beam testing of the 13.625 GHz dielectric loaded accelerating structure, and improve the laser multisplitter for fine-tuning and final adjusting.  Two features will be demonstrated:  (1) generation of the Ramped Bunch Train with the characteristics required for the maximal Transformer Ratio value, and (2) bunch train propagation through the accelerating structure with control of bunch break up (BBU) effects.    Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The enhanced efficiency for Wakefield acceleration could be applied to a variety of accelerators, not only those dedicated to high energy physics.  In addition, the advanced ceramic material developed for the accelerating structure should find multiple applications for dielectric resonators and filters in the wireless communication market, and also may find application to radar and stealth technologies.",

The applied electromagnetic fields induce large currents in the wires leading to and from the MP, which in turn are responsiblefor the MP disruption/damage.  The proposed approach uses microwaves in the 300 MHz-2 GHz range, the PRF diversity in the 10-500 Hz, utilizes the polarization diversity and exploits the potential of multi-path (ground bounce) effect.  Commerciallyavailable suitable compact RF sources are identified, which after minor modifications can be applied in the development of the prototype High Power Electromagnetic System (HPEMS).  These sources can be cascaded to yield higher peak power or higher averagepower via increase in the duty cycle. The prototype HPEMS will be able to disrupt/damage a vehicle's MP at the appreciably large ranges of few hundreds of meters.In addition, an alternative approach using an ultrawideband microwave system, operating in the 300 MHz-10 GHz range and utilizing 46-cm impulse radiating antenna will be tested and evaluated. The concepts can be successfully applied for all-weather,day/night perimeter denial, stopping cars on multi-lane highways, streets and suburban areas. HPEMS will (1)protect high-value public and military objects (buildings/facilities) from terrorist threat, and (2) enable the law enforcement to stop vehicles on highways, roads.

With the recent recommendation for multi-mutation CF screening by the ACMG/ACOG, more labs will be implementing multiplexed genotyping assays. Presently, DNA diagnostic tests for CF are expensive, complicated to run and limited to certain ethnic backgrounds. Using a powerful new technology called AEGIS we propose developing a fast, inexpensive, reliable and easy to run a multiplexed mutation detection system for clinical screening of mutations in the CFTR gene that cause CF in the majority of Americans. In Phase I, proof of concept studies will take place to show that the system is feasible for testing CF mutations on human genomic samples. In Phase Il, we intend to develop a clinical diagnostic assay multi-mutation carrier and newborn CF screening. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: This project could result in an easy to run, low-cost, high-throughput, and ultrasensitive method for Cystic Fibrosis DNA mutation screening that minimizes PCR amplicon handling and is run on an inexpensive validated instrument platform. In addition, validation from this project will open the doors to other test kit development such as population carrier screening for other genetic diseases and research based chromosome mapping studies.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project, over Phase I and Phase II, is to develop and validate a new diagnostic platform for biowarfare detection that provides ultrafast design and implementation. Today, both the scientific and security communities believe that advances in biotechnology have increased the concern for misuse in biological weapon programs. As reports of anthrax attacks across the United States multiplied late last year, an increasing concern grew that new strains with altered genomes may appear. Therefore, new diagnostic technologies that provide quick turnaround assays to previously unknown biowarfare strains are needed. To this end, we developed a novel platform, GENE-CODE 2.0, that provides an ultraquick turn-around to real-time PCR genetic testing. GENE-CODE 2.0 employs an expanded genetic information system (AEGIS) that allows for site-specific enzymatic incorporation of reporter molecules during PCR. The platform has already been demonstrated to the commercial market for ultrasensitive quantitative anthrax detection. In Phase I we have designed and demonstrated the platform for all six CDC Category A biological terror agents. All systems were capable of detecting a single copy of a given bioweapons agent genome.  \n  \nIn Phase II we will develop multiplexed systems to analyze multiple genetic sites within a given biowarfare agent that will allow the manufacturer to change sequence specificity in an ultrafast manner. We will combine two agent-specific detection systems with an internal positive control. Detection of multiple specific targets greatly improves confidence in the specificity of positive assay results. The internal positive control lends credence to negative assay results by confirming the proper function of assay reagents. Both of these features are especially important for bioweapons detection. Once the multiplex goal is achieved we will challenge the systems by testing them with a panel of confounding DNA samples and environmental PCR inhibitors. We will demonstrate a dehydrated reaction formulation that is stable to shipping and storage. We will also develop software tools to facilitate automation of GENE-CODE detection and quantitation of bioagents. When the other aims are met we will validate the GENE-CODE system at an external site.",

        "abstract": "70261B02-II    Methacrylic acid (MAA) and its ester derivatives are important building blocks for many large- volume polymers and resins.  By 1999, the U.S. annual production of the single methyl ester derivative, methyl methacrylate, reached 1.7 billion pounds.  The current commercial route for making MAA and its ester derivatives is the acetone cyanohydrin (ACH) route, a multiple-step preparation that utilizes expensive starting materials, consumes lots of energy, and produces toxic and corrosive waste streams.  This project will develop a cost saving, energy saving, and environmentally friendly catalytic process to make MAA in one step from isobutane, a cheap and abundant natural gas component, with air as the oxidant.  Phase I proved the feasibility of this process by producing MAA directly from isobutane in a one-step catalytic oxidation process using air as the oxidant, and achieving a 6% MAA yield.  Several lead catalysts of various compositions were identified as having excellent potential for further optimization in Phase II.  Phase II will perform a computer-assisted design for the optimization of catalyst compositions, preparation methods, and process conditions to achieve a 25% MAA yield.  Afterwards, characterization studies will be conducted to reveal the active crystal phases responsible for isobutane oxidation and MAA formation.    Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The production of MAA via the one-step selective catalytic oxidation of isobutane could replace the current commercial ACH process, reducing the raw material cost by up to 80%.  This also could provide a significant energy gain because the oxidation of isobutane is an exothermic reaction, while the ACH process consumes energy.   Lastly, it would reduce waste production by avoiding the use of toxic raw materials.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II project will conduct animal toxicology and pharmacokinetics and will initiate clinical evaluation of 22CPPA, a novel pharmacological agent for the prevention/treatment of diabetic glomerulosclerosis. The rationale for this project derives from our work encompassing in vitro and in vivo studies that have established that: a) Amadori-modified glycated albumin (GA) induces significant alterations in glomerular cell biology that are highly reminiscent of the in vivo features of diabetic nephropathy; b) these effects resemble, but operate independent of, those induced by high glucose concentrations and are observed with concentrations of the glycated protein that are found in clinical specimens; c) GA stimulates glomerular production of TGF-beta1 and its type II signaling receptor and activates glomerular PKC-beta and ERK; d) 22CPPA inhibits the condensation of glucose with reactive amino groups in albumin and significantly lowers serum concentrations of GA in hyperglycemic, diabetic animals; and e) in vivo inhibition of the nonenzymatic glycation of albumin by 22CPPA reduces glomerular over-expression of TGF-beta1, and prevents glomerulosclerosis and renal insufficiency even when hyperglycemia prevails. Based on these findings, we have proposed that targeting the over-expression of glomerular TGF-beta1 through inhibiting the excess nonenzymatic glycation of albumin in diabetes is a viable therapeutic strategy for preventing the progression of diabetic glomerulosclerosis and that 22CPPA is a novel clinical candidate for treatment of this morbid complication of diabetes. The Phase I goals of this project, which have been accomplished, were to delineate the dose-response profile of 22CPPA on the therapeutic targets, to examine its acute lethality/toxicity, and to initiate process development in preparation for GMP manufacture of clinical grade compound to be used in the Phase II portions of this project. The Specific Aims of the Phase II project are to: 1) Obtain and complete analytical testing procedures/validation of process developed drug substance and of GMP lot of 22CPPA; 2) Conduct pharmacokinetic and biodistribution profiling and 3) in vitro genetic toxicology testing of 22CPPA; 4) Perform subacute/chronic formal animal toxicology with GMP-manufactured 22CPPA to support human clinical Phase I safety, metabolism and pharmacokinetic studies (4 week animal tox.) and clinical Phase IIA (12 week animal tox.) trials in human subjects; 5) Submit an Investigational New Drug application to the FDA; 6) Complete Phase I clinical safety studies in normal healthy human volunteers (single rising dose and multiple rising dose), according to protocols submitted to and approved by the FDA; 7) Perform short-term Phase IIA clinical studies in target (diabetic) population, monitoring safety and evaluating efficacy with surrogate markers, according to protocols submitted to and approved by the FDA; 8) Present results to prospective commercialization partners.",

However, in many areas of the country the lack of specialists make home modifications difficult to obtain. The purpose of this project is to develop an innovative database that includes both comprehensive search criteria related to functional abilities and the full range of technological and environmental modifications that are necessary to provide individualized solutions. This database will enhance the capacity of rehabilitation and building professionals throughout the country to provide home modification services, particularly to under-served populations. Unlike existing databases, the product developed in this project will provide sufficient information for a broad array of potential providers who might lack detailed knowledge of home modification alternatives, to specify, obtain, install, and construct complete and optimal home modification solutions regardless of the complexity of the situation or the extent of the modifications needed or desired. In Phase 1 a review of existing databases provided the basis for developing the new product. A prototype of the database that includes solutions to the most common environmental barriers encountered by older adults in using the bathroom was developed. The protoype was pretested in 10 homes and found to be highly feasible based on the high degree of concurrence between home modification solutions generated by the database and those recommended by a home modifications specialist. Phase 2 of the project will develop and test instructional materials to accompany the database; complete database development; and demonstrate the effectiveness of the database as a tool that will significantly expand the capacity of local occupational therapists, case managers, and remodelers to provide individualized modifications at reasonable costs even when access to experts is not possible.",

This includes compatibility and security issues, power requirements, system bandwidth capabilities and the problems associated with RF transmissions (i.e. multipathand fading).  Candidate wireless technologies such as 802.11a, g, and UWB will be identified.  The primary goal is to create a secure, modular system that is flexible and upgradeable. The developments from this project will help to bring wireless networking to a new level of security.  The modular design of these secure wireless network devices will allow marketing to the commercial and private sector with lower encryption power, butstill substantially better protection than is currently available.   This is because the design takes into account that the Ethernet medium itself is open and easily monitored.  The configurable plug-in security modules will operate independently of thenormal network security features thus making it difficult for unauthorized personnel to identify and understand the network traffic.  The modular aspects of the security components will allow systems to be easily upgraded to the latest standards, whilerequiring no changes to the software configuration of the users on the network.The technologies and methods developed in this program can be applied to numerous military systems, potentially including naval platforms, shielded data centers, underground command bunkers, and large space-borne equipment such as space stations.  Lunaalso anticipates large non-defense related markets in industrial instrumentation systems coupled with wireless transmission capability.For commercializing a submarine wireless LAN (SWLAN) business based on the program described in this proposal, we envision using Luna i-Monitoring, the most recent of Luna's five spinoff companies, to become the full scale engineering, development, andproduction source for the subject business.",

        "abstract": "One of the most promising technologies to provide weapons suitable for ballistic missile defense is directed energy weapons systems such as high-energy lasers (HELs), mounted on aircraft as in the airborne laser (ABL) system, or on satellites.  As HELs areweaponized, there is a need to characterize the effects that these newly-developed weapons have on realistic targets.  Currently, there exists no technology capable of providing quantitative data essential to the development of directed energy weapons.Luna Innovations proposes to solve the challenge of characterizing the damage to directed energy weapon targets during simulated attacks.  Luna will leverage its experience in extreme harsh environment, ceramic / fiber optic-based sensors to accomplishthis task.  Sensors will be designed and constructed to include co-located temperature and strain transducers in a media-isolated probe that will be mounted on the inside surface of the target fuel tank.  A high-speed, highly-multiplexed fiber opticreadout system will be developed that will read 64 strain sensors and 64 temperature sensors sampling at 1kHz and 10kHz respectively.  During the Phase I, Luna Innovations demonstrated fiber optic-based strain and temperature sensors at over 1000\u00bfC.  Afiber optic sensor readout system was designed that will meet the specifications described above.",

The in vitro modification and selection (IVMS) process under development by the Luna teamovercomes the limitations of current biosensor technologies by converting a known biomolecular sensor - the receptor for a steroid hormone - into a new sensor that specifically recognizes the target organic compound of choice.For this program, Luna Innovations and the University of Virginia are utilizing the IVMS process to develop a flexible biosensor platform for the detection of VX.  During the Phase I program, the Luna team has focused on developing the receptor technologyand demonstrating its feasibility for the detection of organophosphates in a yeast-based biosensor.  Specific Phase I program achievements include the optimization of the screening process, selection of a receptor library enriched for receptors that bindDemeton-S, and demonstration of a yeast-based FRET biosensor technology with ppb sensitivity.  During the Phase II program, Luna will leverage the experience with Demeton-S to develop a rapid, reliable, and sensitive detection system for VX, easilyexpandable to incorporate additional organic chemical targets of interest. Research concerning biosensors will yield immediate applications in 1) chemical/ biological agent detection, 2) mine and explosives detection, 3) drinking and wastewater monitoring, 4) therapeutic drug monitoring, 5) chemical analysis, and 6) intelligentprocess monitoring of advanced materials.

Fatigue of high-temperature turbine components is a leading source of failure and necessitates excessive design margins or early replacement.  This project will develop a ceramic pressure and temperature sensor capable of simultaneously measuring temperature and pressure within the hottest regions of modern and emerging utility gas turbines (1400\u00bfC).  These sensor transducers will be interrogated with optical fiber, instead of electrical leads, and have exceptional accuracy and temperature stability, compared to state-of-the-art piezo sensor technology.  In Phase I, fiber optic temperature sensors were demonstrated to 1100\u00bfC.  Both pressure and temperature sensor designs were developed for operation up to 1400\u00bfC.  Rugged, high-temperature fiber optic cabling, capable of withstanding a harsh, industrial environment, was also demonstrated.  Finally, a low-cost fiber optic readout system was designed and demonstrated.  Phase II will continue the development of the fiber optic pressure and temperature sensors.  Extensive testing will be conducted in combustion tubes and on operational utility gas turbines.  A fiber optic readout system will be optimized for use in the utility gas turbine environment.     Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  These sensors not only should be applicable to utility gas turbine engines, but also should find use in fuel cells, geo-thermal power production, and possibly high-temperature nuclear reactor applications.",

During the Phase I SBIR research effort, the LunaInnovations researchers were able to measure a 1200\u00bfC rise in 0.5ms (2.4million\u00bfC/s) rise rate with a proprietary bonded non-metallic thin film fiber-optic temperature sensor.  The Proposed Phase II will continue the development of a sensing systemconsisting of the proprietary bonded sensors and high speed, 4 channel instrumentation system to achieve the design goals with commercially ready sensing systems.  For explosives characterization, fiber optic sensors offer many advantages over equivalentelectrical sensors.  These are: extreme thermal capability, immunity to electro-magnetic interference and grounding issues, and the ability transmit data kilometers with minute signal degradation (less than 3dB/km).  This Phase II project will develop thisconcept to fruition and facilitate commercialization of both the sensors and the sensing instrumentation. The technical objectives of this Phase II proposal will further identify sensor and system requirements (materials, processes, and electronics) anddevelop implement those to meet the primary objective and will demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed development.Thermal measurement is a vast market with a myriad of environments.  Thermocouples are by far the most prevalent technology for thermal measurement but are also limited in application environment.  Thermocouples cannot typically be utilized in reacting,corrosive, or electrically noisy environments above 1800\u00bfC.  Miniature, inert, intrinsically safe, EMI proof, remote temperature sensors rugged enough for explosions would open the remaining markets not currently available to thermocouples such as gasturbine engine combustor monitoring, rocket engine combustion monitoring, and chemical process monitoring.  Luna sees this technology rapidly fulfilling the challenging harsh environment markets of thermal measurement as well as those in heat fluxmeasurements.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):Experimental work done to date indicates that Optoacoustic Tomography will provide breast images with greater contrast and sensitivity to cancer than the currently preferred methods. In a Laser Optoacoustic Imaging System (LOIS), short, near-infrared laser pulses are preferentially absorbed by breast tumors. As a result, pressure waves are generated at the absorption sites. These propagate to the surface where they can be detected with ultra-wideband ultrasonic transducers. Computer processing of the detected signals results in an image in which contrast is largely determined by the tissue blood content. Cancerous tumors are blood rich because they develop a dense network of leaky blood vessels through the process of angiogenesis. The contrast in an optoacoustic image is significantly higher than that in images acquired with x-rays or ultrasound. Imaging with 2 different laser wavelengths can provide diagnostic information. Images taken with a wavelength of 1064 nm are particularly sensitive to the distribution of oxygenated blood. Images taken with a wavelength of 760 nm are more sensitive to the distribution of deoxygenated blood. Combining and/or comparing the two types of images yields a means for differentiation between cancerous and non-cancerous lesion. LOIS is suitable for examination of the breasts of all women, regardless of their age or skin color. The overall goal of this project is to develop a commercial prototype optoacoustic imager. The work of the Lasersonix team during Phase II will focus on incorporation of the components developed in Phase I into a complete 2D imaging system called LOIS-2D. LOIS-2D will be tested with 24 patients with suspicious breast lesions to verify the proper performance of the equipment and to perform initial tests of its diagnostic capability in collaboration with UTMB. The commercial prototype of a 3D optoacoustic imager, LOIS-3D, will be designed, developed, and fabricated. Specifically, a three-dimensional transducer array will be produced. The electronics and software will be modified to handle an increased number of detectors. The number of electronic channels that can be processed in parallel will be increased to 128. Image reconstruction will be performed in hardware. 3D images will be reconstructed in close to real time through a computer fusion of 20 images produced in real time.",

However, its lack of stability in Li-ion cells at high temperatures is well known and has limited its commercial use. This project will develop a novel, low cost concept for stabilizing LiMn2O4.  The concept will be implemented in a treatment process for potential scale-up and use in a safe, low cost, high-power Li-ion battery system for multiple applications, including electric and hybrid electric vehicles.  During Phase I, the novel stabilization concept was demonstrated to be valid.  The materials that were synthesized and characterized exhibited much greater capacity retention at elevated temperatures in full Li-ion cells with carbon anodes.  In addition, the new materials had similar capacity, high-rate capability, and safety when compared to the standard lithium manganese oxide cathode.  During Phase II, the parameters controlling the stabilization process will be investigated in detail.  The results will be used to scale up for the production of tens of kilograms of uniform material, which will be evaluated in full cells, by several battery manufacturers interested in Li-ion cell applications.

        "abstract": "Ultra-Wideband radar systems could contribute significantly to the detection and identification of unknown objects. UWB radars have been shown to work well in environments where conventional radars fail, such as looking through foliage or soil. However,UWB radars suffer from the lack of an antenna with low sidelobes, while still maintaining the ability to radiate a clean impulse. Currently available UWB antennas, such as the reflector Impulse Radiating Antenna, have a problem with sidelobes that aredifficult to treat. In addition,  antennas fabricated from lenses are often too heavy to be practical. Finally, UWB antennas, when mounted on an airborne platform, present a large radar cross section (RCS) to X-band radars. To address the problem ofsidelobes in UWB antennas we propose to develop Lens TEM horns. These devices have more uniform aperture fields than more traditional reflector IRAs, so they are expected to have lower sidelobes. In order to keep the weight of the antenna to a minimum,artificial dielectric (AD) materials will be used to fabricate the lens. Since commercially available AD materials are too heavy, we will develop our own materials, consisting of a uniform array of discs embedded into a lightweight foam. Such a materialwill have a density one-sixteenth that of polyethylene. To reduce the RCS of the antenna, we will place it behind a radome covered with a Frequency Selective Surface (FSS). Such a surface can be designed to be transparent to UWB signals below 2 GHz, and tobe opaque to X-band signals. By this method, X-band radar signals reflect off the aircraft skin as if the radome were covered with a continuous perfect electric conductor.",

The Phase I proof-of-concept demonstrated the accelerateddelivery of BChE into the circulatory system using needle-free injection.  The second phase of this project will consist of the following three tasks:  1)  Develop and quantify a prototype needle-free injector.  This task includes product, environmentaland human safety testing.  A protector cap will be used to prevent pathogen transfer between patients;  2) Conduct trials on non-human primates to determine the percent of enzyme delivered, the peak level of enzyme activity and the duration of the enzymeat that level;  3) Determine the efficacy of this enzyme as a bioscavenger by exposing injected rodents to OP or pesticides; and 4) Deliver a prototype injector to the Army for chemical warfare studies.  The overall goal of this project is to provide theArmy with a system to allow rapid injection of the enzyme into soldiers in the event of a chemical attach on the battlefield.  In order to achieve this goal, the usability, safety and efficacy of the device will be proven. For the military, this devicewould allow rapid injection of troops prior to a potential chemical exposure.  In this situation, troops should be injected 12 hours prior to possible exposure and re-injected weekly as long as the threat continues.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Commercial applications for soy isoflavones have grown significantly in recent years. Isoflavones are used in health foods and as nutritional supplements. More recently they are being investigated as antioxidants, protecting skin from UV damage when taken orally or used topically. More importantly, isoflavones and their derivatives have potential to be used as pharmaceuticals in the fight against certain cancers, heart disease, and osteoporosis. Fermalogic identified a method for the isolation of isoflavones as a by-product of the Saccharopolyspora erythraea erythromycin fermentation, but in order to be commercially successful, a problem with degradation of the isoflavones during the fermentation had to be solved. In Phase I of this project the first metabolite of the isoflavone degradation pathway was identified. During Phase II we hope to find the gene responsible for this degradation and inactivate it. This should raise production levels of isoflavones to commercially useful levels. In addition/other bacterial fermentations will be investigated for the production of new biologically active isoflavone metabolites.",

        "abstract": "70192S02-II    Thermo-electrically (TE) cooled, long wave infrared detectors, with superior performance for remote chemical sensing of different compounds, are needed for the monitoring of weapons of mass destruction.  Current technology suffers from device degradation and large leakage currents, which render them unusable for the most part. This project will incorporate advanced, liquid phase epitaxy growth to fabricate high quality HgCdTe detectors with a novel structure, i.e., where the junction is in the large band-gap region, providing more robustness.  The leakage current also will be reduced, along with detector noise, while maintaining the superior characteristics of the HgCdTe device.  In Phase I, detectors with a cut-off wavelength of 10 \u00bfm, operating at TE-cooled temperatures, were produced.  These detectors showed very good performance characteristics with typical detectivity of 2-4x108 Jones.  Phase II will gradually extend the cut-off wavelength of the devices beyond 10 \u00bfm, while improving the photo-response.  Four packaged TE-cooled detectors will be sent to DOE, one every six months, during Phase II.    Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  Low cost, high performance, TE-cooled detector systems should have application to the remote sensing of dangerous chemicals, as well as to anti-terrorist efforts and security applications.",

In addition, Fermionics will select a subcontractor(s) to develop the miniaturizedcamera electronics. Finally, prototype cameras will be manufactured. In Phase III, MWIR HgCdTe FPA cameras will be mass-produced for the Navy and for other commercial applications. The manned land/sea/air vehicle, and infantry military market for suchsensors could be in excess of 1000 cameras per year.

Automated fiber placement such as Braiding provide significant cost savings. Braiding is a proven and cost-effective method that is inherently wellsuited to many engine part configurations. To date RTM processing for engine parts has been limited by process characteristics of high temperature resins like PMR15.

The combination of Braiding and RTM has been demonstrated in Phase I to offer a lighter frame than the present titanium frame at cost parity (i.e. no cost penalty).

The new device is being called an \"Assisted Self- Management Monitor.\" There are many diseases, such as diabetes, which are considered \"self-managed\" diseases. With diabetes, it is expected that patients measure and monitor their own blood glucose levels, their own medication administration, and their own diet and exercise programs. When patients properly and actively manage their own disease, they will minimize the disease progression. Otherwise, the effects can be tragic in terms of disease progression and health care costs. Mismanaged diabetes will eventually put the patient at risk for coronary artery disease, stroke, kidney failure, blindness, and peripheral vascular disease. Furthermore, there is often a significant time lag between when a patient collects self-care information and when a medical staff is made aware of that information. The new device underdevelopment is designed to actually monitor and evaluate how well patients are self-managing their disease, and then provide feedback to the care staff and the patient when irregularities are detected. Initially, the system is intended to help diabetic patients living in an assisted living setting. The new device will automatically transfer a patient's glucose reading and medication usage information from his or her quarters to a central station. There, the information will be compared to a personal profile that has been developed for each individual patient.

        "abstract": "Fort Environmental Laboratories, Inc.\u00bfs Phase I research project resulted in the development and standardization of an assay that tests substances that might disturb reproductive and developmental processes in animals by interfering with the endocrine system.  The primary goal of the proposed research was to validate and commercialize the Xenopus laevis oocyte maturation germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) model as a system for the rapid evaluation of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) found in the workplace or the environment.  Specifically, a 24-hour X. laevis assay modified from the original work of Pickford and Morris (Environmental Health Perspectives 1999;107(4):285-292) and Lui and Patino (Biology of Reproduction 1993;49:980-988) designed to evaluate progestin-active or anti-progestin EDCs in vitro was standardized and evaluated by conducting a preliminary validation study with a series of known EDCs, compounds found to be inactive, and chemicals with unknown activity.  \n\nThe relative inhibitory potential of the toxicants study was ethinyl estradiol>>Aroclor 1260>atrazine>dieldrin.  Testosterone and the confined animal feed operation (CAFO) waste complex mixture sample had a stimulatory effect on GVBD.  Bisphenol A had no effect on GVBD, even at concentrations of 5,000 \u00bfM.  The binding capacity of the toxicants to the oocyte membrane plasma receptor (OMPR) relative to progesterone was low.  Interestingly, testosterone possessed some binding capacity to the OMPR, indicating that the OMPR may be a more precocious binding site than originally anticipated.  However, the relative binding affinity of the toxicants to the OMPR was expressed as progesterone>>ethinyl estradiol (-)>testosterone (+)>atrazine (-)>Aroclor 1260 (-) >dieldrin (-)>CAFO sample (+)>bisphenol A (NE).  The washout studies indicated that although the competitive binding affinity of ethinyl estradiol for the OMPR was the greatest of the test compounds evaluated in the present study, testosterone, dieldrin, and Aroclor 1260 were bound more tightly to the OMPR than ethinyl estradiol.  \n\nBecause none of the currently developed high throughput EDC screening systems are capable of specifically screening for progesterone-active EDCs, the successful completion of the in vitro oocyte GVBD model development will provide the scientific community with a non-mammalian, cost-effective, rapid, and reliable method of screening EDCs.  The ability to rapidly and cost-effectively screen for and evaluate the mechanisms of EDCs is an attractive alternative to the current laborious and expensive testing systems used today.  Increasing concerns over the widespread finding of EDCs in the environment have dramatically increased the need for standardized assays, such as the X. laevis GVBD model, because few other progestin/antiprogestin-based in vitro assays are available today.",

        "abstract": "Netting is currently used on U.S. Navy ships to provide fallprotection for landing/maintenance crews.  This netting in pastyears was fabricated using metallic cord and at present isconstructed from nylon braid.  The metal nets were quite durable,but added to the ship radar cross-section and were heavy.   Thenylon used now is lightweight and has no radar signature, butmust be replaced every 12 to18 months due to UV degradation andabrasion.  Foster-Miller utilized high performance Liquid CrystalPolymer (LCP) fibers to address the Navy's need for an improveddeck-edge safety net with a 5+ year life-cycle.  During Phase I,lightweight cords were produced and tested for their ability towithstand harsh marine environments and loading conditions.  Testresults indicate that superior mechanical properties andweatherability can be achieved using cords with high-strength LCPfiber based cores.  During Phase II, Foster-Miller's advancedlong-life netting will be refined and installed on a selectedNavy vessel such as a DDG-51.  Netting fabrication schemes willalso be developed that significantly reduce the logistics burdenand time for assembly/installation.  In the option phase on-sitetraining of enlisted personnel will be conducted and appropriatetraining documentation will be prepared. (p00378)BENEFITS: Our long-life netting will provide the Navy with a lightweight personnel safety webbing which will be inexpensive to maintain and robust enough to last 5+ years in harsh marine environments.  Government and commercial applications for long-lifesafety nets are numerous and include a number of near-term and future applications.  The cords alone can find use in markets such as sonobuoy cables, ship handling cables, helicopter rescue cables, parachutes cords, stainless wire replacement, and trawlcables.  On naval vessels, applications such as emergency egress trunk nets, save-all nets, or cargo nets are excellent examples where this technology can be used.",

GPS/INS guided weapons are launched without target overflight from increasing standoff ranges and, in mostcases, the aircrew does not observe weapons impact and cannot make a battle damage assessment.  High overhead or UAV imagery often is unavailable or is unable to discern target damage.  Manned overflight for battle damage assessment/indication negates thesurvivability advantage provided by long-range precision weapons.  The objective of this project is to continue development of a Detachable Bomb Pursuit Vehicle (DBPV) that will ride along with the precision weapon, detach itself during the terminal phaseof the weapon's flight, then acquire and track the weapon, transmitting real-time imagery of weapon impact and effects.  Phase I focused on proving concept feasibility through analysis of weapon flight conditions, modeling of DBPV flight stability, anddetermination of required sensor performance.  A system operation timeline and initial system architecture were developed.  Phase II will focus on development of the tracking system and algorithms, release mechanism, and system integration.  Prototypesystems will be fabricated and demonstrated in subsonic flight conditions to prove out the tracking approach and system concept. (P-030127)",

        "abstract": "The DoD requires lightweight, stiff and stable mirrors for use in high quality, space-based optical observation and energy projection systems. Current technology uses various types of honeycomb core material with optical and composite face sheets.  Thehoneycomb material, while excellent in compression, does not transfer the bending shear loads efficiently enough for truly lightweight optical systems. Honeycomb mirrors also are slow and costly to manufacture.During the Phase I program, Foster-Miller developed a novel mirror system that uses highly efficient truss structures to provide bending stiffness for a thin meniscus mirror face sheet. The Composite Hybrid Isogrid Mirror (CHIM) uses axially oriented,high-modulus fibers to provide an efficient, dimensionally stable, support structure. This structure supported the face sheet using truss elements rather than honeycomb plates and reduced the mirror density to 2.7 kg/m2. The manufacturing techniques reduceand simplify the steps required and thus reduce production cost and schedule.In Phase II, Foster-Miller will develop the CHIM system through a careful plan of design, modeling, and prototype manufacture and testing. Complete development of this technology will provide a mirror system that will enable better, lighter, and lessexpensive optical instruments with an ultimate density goal of 1.2 kg/m2. (P-030064)",

The CTM will be optimized for IR detection and identification of chemical threats in the 8 to 12 micron spectral region and be ready for rapid transition tocommercial manufacture.

We believe that LCPs have several advantages for use as MEMS substrates, including:Low substrate costLarge substrate areaDemonstrated compatibility with microfabrication processesFlexibility of LCP materials will allow designers to consider flexible and bendable MEMS structureWhile the basic focus of this program is to develop microfabrication processes and demonstrate the ability to form microstructures in LCPs, consideration must also be given to the eventual packaging and integration of the MEMS system. In fact, many MEMSexperts will tell you that packaging and interconnection is one of the biggest issues facing MEMS today. Bearing this in mind, our ultimate aim, by the end of the Phase II program, is to develop a 3-D integration of the MEMS structures, associatedcomponents and the system packaging and interconnection. We believe that LCPs offer the best approach to achieving this ultimate goal. (P-020513)This program will develop and demonstrate a low-cost MEMS device technology based on LCP substrates.

The system is a micro-pumped, two-phase heat transport loop that employs multiple micro-pumps to move a cryogenic fluid between anevaporator and a condenser.  The system is simpler than either a cryogenic CPL or loop heat pipe and a liquid accumulator and a sintered capillary wick structure are not needed for operation, which greatly reduces both the system mass and fluid charge.The proposed system also is completely gravity insensitive which makes reliable and repeatable ground testing possible.   The micro-pumped cryogenic heat transport loop is particularly adaptable for use across a two-axis gimbal, since flexure can beprovided by simply adding coils to the system tubing.  The use of multiple micro-pumps provides redundancy and reliability to the system and can control temperature precisely at the electronic interface.  The drive actuator for the micro- pump is auniquely designed electromagnetic voice coil that operates at extremely low power, on the order of 7 mW, and is considerably smaller than piezoelectric actuators now used in many micro-pumps.

        "abstract": "The Marine Corps AAAV is a quantum leap forward in sea and beachhead mobility over the current AAV A2.  This is derived by its 25 knot performance in water combined with a 45 MPH land speed.  To achieve this performance, weight is a critical factor for thevehicle, but operation and maintenance costs are also critical. Therefore, this Phase II proposal will refine the road wheel concepts generated in Phase I.  Both road wheel designs will have a lower initial cost and a slight weight reduction as compared tothe production road wheels. As the wear rings will be improved, the field endurance life of the wheel will be increased.  Finally, the wheel will be refurbishable at a depot as the wear ring can be replaced.  This will further reduce the O&S costs of thesystem.  Additional research will be conducted on lightweight wear rings for further weight reduction in the future.  A vehicle set of two road wheel designs will be manufactured and field tested on an AAAV.  Thus, this Phase II program will bring thepreliminary designs through laboratory testing and finally, full vehicle testing to demonstrate the design and technology The application of lightweight robust road wheels has many implications beyond the AAAV which it is specifically designed for.  Theprimary advantages to General Dynamics Amphibious System's AAAV is a lower initial cost, a longer endurance life, the ability to refurbish the wheel, and also a slightly lower weight as compared to the current production road wheel.  The hollow shelldesign also carries greater lateral load than traditional dished or I-Beam designs.  With these attributes, GDAS will develop a  Level III TDP for the road wheel to allow limited production quantities to be purchased, pending success of the initial fieldtests.These lightweight road wheels are of high interest to the FCS manned ground vehicle variant if it is determined to be a tracked vehicle.Transition of the lightweight hollow shell wheel design to weight sensitive wheeled commercial vehicles including timber harvesting and horizontal boring equipment in wet or soft soil conditions would be a logical extension of the technology.  Marketing ofthis area would initiate after the technology was proven by production in the military market.",

        "abstract": "This proposal focuses on the design and realization of a Rapid Development Environment (RDE) for synthesizing Physiological Diagnostic Systems. A high level of productivity will be reached through the development of libraries of sensors, and of elementaryand complex physiology models. The user will compose a diagnostic algorithm and system prototype by combining building blocks thorough an intelligent graphical user interface. Composing, testing and validating a diagnostic system will be matter of daysinstead of months.The intended RDE will allow the user to specify both algorithmic content and hardware structure of diagnostic systems. The sensor libraries provided for this goal will allow modeling any sensor behavior, and will also accurately encode their reliability.This feature allows the software to accomplish two goals. The first one will be computing the ability of the diagnostic algorithms to perform their intended task. The second one will be to accurately estimate the reliability of a prospective physicalprototype as a whole and of every single component. Finally, the RDE will feature simulation capabilities for producing data streams of physiological parameters. These data streams will be useful for forecasting the prototype behavior in a wide variety ofrealistic contexts.  This set of computational tools will have both military and civilian applications. Health monitoring systems developed with such tools have a broad base of applications. Telemedicine and web-based monitoring of home health patients and elderly peoplejust represent two major fields. Other relevant fields are in all the situations where health or life is at stake, and quick intervention is required. As an example, mountaineers could clearly benefit from a monitoring system featuring global positioningsystem capabilities. The athletes represent another category that could be greatly interested. In fact, they need to monitor their training stress in order to achieve the maximum result. Other categories involve police officers, fire fighters andprofessional scuba divers, just to cite a few.",

The ability to store frozen cells would allow sufficient time for adequate screening to be performed. Therefore, the overall goal of this continuing research is to further develop and optimize an improved system for cryopreservation and storage of human placental/umbilical cord blood (PCB) derived hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), especially as it relates to improving the retention of normal structure and function of frozen-thawed cells to improve clinical outcome (engraftment). In Phase I, a system was developed which provides (1) an efficient, simplified method of bulk-freezing HPC units, and (2) optimized removal of cryoprotectant (DMSO) while maintaining a closed system. In Phase II, this system will be refined to allow (1) ease of use in the clinical environment, and (2) ease of manufacture/commercialization. It is the goal of this Phase II proposal to refine the closed cryopreservation, storage, and PCB washing system based on sound biophysical cell-type specific characteristics and mathematical modeling which will allow efficient and safe use of cryopreserved PCB derived HPCs. To achieve this goal, the following specific aims are proposed: (1) Validation and refinement of the cryopreservation method/system-using colony forming assays in semi-solid media to determine clonogenic ability, (2) Validation and refinement using a human long-term culture initiating cell (LTC-IC) assay, and (3) Testing of the cryopreservation system by freezing/thawing/washing HPCs and transplanting into a NOD/SCID mouse model.",

The potential customers for this technology and the size of their markets are growing. According to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) UAV roadmap, the US DoD will invest over $4 billion inUAVs over the next decade. This will include a substantial investment in autonomous control systems technologies that significantly enhance the operational utility of UAVs by allowing a few, or even a single, operator(s) with minimal training toeffectively manage and control groups of vehicles. The integration of VACS with Playbook will open up many new opportunities within the UAV industry. The first anticipated customer within the DoD market will be the Organic Air Vehicle (OAV) component ofthe Future Combat System?s program headed by DARPA and the U.S. Army. Our research will also benefit key DoD initiatives, including the DARPA/Army?s Future Combat Systems program proper and the Navy?s Autonomous Operations, both of which will require morereliable autonomous and semi-autonomous systems technologies. We believe the proposed effort will provide the necessary technology that truly enables multiple vehicle command and control by a single operator in the Air Force?s Multi-Mission Command andControl Aircraft (MC2A), the Navy?s Multi Mission Aircraft (MMA), the Air Forces Next Generation Gunship program. Farther afield, there are a number of other consumers of variable-initiative human involvement with automation. Chief among these currentlyare those branches of NASA involved in deep space manned and unmanned exploration. Critical to realizing the revolutionary potential of UAVs and UCAVs in the battlefield is efficient autonomous guidance and control (G&C). It must be possible for a smallnumber of non-rated operators to simultaneously control multiple, diverse unmanned vehicles while concurrently engaged in other du-ties, and exposed to threats and interruptions. The proposed effort will develop a control system archi-tecture, calledP-VACS (Playbook-enhanced Variable Autonomy Control System), that meets these strin-gent demands through the synergistic integration of two state-of-the-art control approaches. Smart Infor-mation Flow Technologies? Playbook supervisory control systemprovides an integrated ?front end? to a control architecture that unifies variable initiative user input and intelligent planning capabilities to allow very high level tasking of UAV assets and smart, automated detection and replanning when initial plansgo awry. Geneva Aerospace, Inc.?s Variable Autonomy Control System provides a modular, integrated control architecture enabling management and control of multiple UAVs by a single operator via novel gradient control techniques. Unifying these twoapproaches will provide a uniquely powerful, autono-mous multi-UAV guidance and control system that enables cooperative control of groups of UAVs at flexible levels of autonomy by a single operator?even within the challenging domain of OAV control in urbanterrain.",

        "abstract": "The primary objective of the SBIR effort proposed herein is to investigate the feasibility of significantly improving the near infrared (NIR) imaging quality by using a novel 3D image device to provide accurate three-dimensional (3D) geometric boundaryconditions in nonlinear reconstruction process.NIR imaging has re-emerged as a promising imaging modality and dramatically improved our ability to localize and quantify tissue structures with light. However, the advanced NIR algorithm requires good knowledge of the boundary geometry of the diffusemedium imaged in order to provide accurate forward models of light propagation within this medium.  Original experimental NIR demonstrations for reconstructing absorbers, scatterers and fluorochromes all used phantoms or tissues confined to easily modeledgeometries such as a slab or a cylinder.  In recent years several methods have been developed to model photon propagation through diffuse media with complex boundaries using Monte Carlo approaches, finite solutions of the diffusion or transport equation ormore recently analytical methods based on the tangent-plane method.  To fully exploit the advantages to these sophisticated algorithms, accurate 3D boundary geometry of the subject has to be extracted in practical, real-time, and in vivo manner.To date, there is no known reported technique for extracting 3D dimensional boundaries with fully automated, accurate and real-time in vivo performance.  We propose this SBIR project to address this urgent need.  Our successful Phase 1 effort has resultedin a functional prototype and demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed 3D DOT concept.  The Phase 2 effort is to further optimize the hardware design, develop 3D DOT reconstruction algorithms, and perform extensive tests to validate the overall design.The long-team goal of this research project is to develop a new optical tomography system that coherently combines the diffuse optical tomographic sensor/light source with real-time precision 3D surface images device so that the boundary geometry of theobject to be imaged would be extracted almost simultaneously as the NIR imaging is performing.The long-team goal of this research project is to develop a new generation optical tomography system that coherently combines the diffuse optical tomographic sensor/light source with real-time precision 3D surface images device so that the boundarygeometry of the object to be imaged would be extracted almost simultaneously as the NIR imaging is performing.

This need has risen due to the inherent complexity of biological systems and the enormity of currently generated biological data sets such as those from whole-genome transcriptional profiling. We have played a leading role in developing methods for computational systems biology through the construction of genome -scale in silico models of prokaryotes. These metabolic models are based on the principles of constraints-based modeling. As one of the next stages in the logical development and implementation of in silico models, the focus of this STTR program is aimed at assessing the ability to use constraints-based models of metabolism to provide integrative analysis of metabolic gene expression patterns under varying environmental conditions. In addition to advancing the application range of in silico modeling and simulation, success of this program will lead to an improvement in gene expression analysis, namely the introduction of modeling-assisted interpretation of whole-genome expression patterns. This will have an impact on all life sciences research that is utilizing gene expression profiling technologies to address human health and disease. In this Phase II STTR effort we aim to accelerate the development and commercialization of the modeling technology developed in Phase I. The most valuable commercial aspect of this project lies in the development of a modeling approach that can be coupled to expression array analysis for any organism. Herein we have selected baker's yeast, Saccaromyces cerevisiae, as the showcase organism for a proof-of-concept This technology development wiII be embodied in an expanded version of our proprietary modeling platform, SimPheny (registered trademark of Genomatica), to contain a module dedicated to the management, visualization, and integration of gene expression data with in silico models. In addition we will also generate a model for baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is of clear commercial value. Yeast strains are some of the most important and widely used microorganism in academic and industrial life sciences research.

The caseauthoring system is intelligently assistive to non-tech-savvy SMEs and the integrated learning management system provides a dynamic, data-driven, and individualistic learning experience to student users.  Phase II work will result in a production version,scientifically tested, and commercial-ready, set of case authoring tools and processes for SMEs to remotely develop libraries of cases that incorporate analogical reasoning concepts and methods.

This project addresses the need to further reduce the cost of wind energy, by developing an innovative rotor design for commercially available, megawatt-scale wind turbines.  In order to reduce loads without increasing system costs, an adaptive blade will be designed to change pitch (twist) at the same time it bends in response to changes in wind speed.  This will be accomplished by making optimal use of carbon fiber.  Phase I examined a matrix of possible blade designs and identified several that offer significant energy reductions.  The study included updated and current carbon-fiber-material properties, manufacturing methods, and cost information to ensure that an optimized design can deliver at least a roughly 5% energy reduction.  Phase II will design, build, and test a megawatt-scale (30 m) blade that uses bend-twist coupling to reduce loads without increasing overall costs.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Through metabolic engineering of the yeast glycosylation pathway, GlycoFi is developing yeast capable of secreting recombinant proteins with human-like glycosylation. In Phase I, a toolkit of cloning vectors, strains, libraries and protocols were developed for targeting glycosylation enzymes to the yeast secretory pathway. The feasibility of this approach was demonstrated by the functional expression of sigma-1,2,-mannosidase in vivo, resulting in the production of a recombinant protein with 65 percent human-like Man5glycosylation structure. This Phase II proposal aims to develop an automated, high-throughput approach capable of screening 3000 samples per week for highly efficient enzyme catalytic domains. These enzymes will be incorporated into a production strain generating commercially important proteins with a human-like Man5glycosylation structure. Proposed Commercial Application: A shortage of manufacturing capacity has emerged as the single largest barrier preventing therapeutic proteins in the development pipeline from reaching the clinic. GlycoFi's novel yeast-based protein production platform will alleviate this bottleneck and allow the bio-pharmaceutical industry to bring their products to market in a faster and more cost effective manner.",

        "abstract": "Recent events have put great demands on the simulation community for accurate simulation of mission rehearsal and training scenarios based on Support and Stability Operations (SASO), Operations Other Than War (OOTW), and Operations concerning AsymmetricThreat.  Current mission rehearsal systems such as OneSAF and WARSIM do not satisfactorily model civilian and non-military combatant sides crucial in the outcome of these operations.   Gnosys and SAIC propose to build PGREDS, a tool that will allow ascenario designer to bring to bear multi-disciplinary models (political, geographic, religious economic and demographic) to define civilian and non-military sides in scenario generation and execution systems.  The strength of tools lies in itsincorporation of any number of lead-edge, interdisciplinary models, its ability to resolve multiple, potentially conflicting answers into a single, consistent resolution, and in its ability to easily interface with existing scenario generation andexecution systems.  PGREDS will have applicability to military simulation as well as private industry population modeling needs.The anticipated results of the proposed approach are:1)       The addition of realistic civilian and non-combatant sides in current simulation systems such as OneSAF or AEAS without rewriting them.2)       The ability to include cutting-edge models for civilian and non-military sides from several different disciplines as they are developed.3)      The definition of a framework by which newly developed models for civilian and non-military sides can be ?plugged? into leading edge, mission rehearsal systems easily.4)       Making the process of employing methodologies from traditionally ignored fields of study (such as the social sciences) into leading edge simulation systems.5)  The ability to run multiple, interdisciplinary models and vary the gravity of their results, enables a scenario designer to emphasize certain results over others (e.g. cultural over economic models) based on the specifics of a mission training scenario(such as location, history, commanders judgments, etc.)The strategy for commercialization is two-fold:1)    As an add-on component to existing/emerging military simulation systems.2)      As a stand-alone population simulation system for industrial enterprises.Current users of simulation systems would purchase PGREDS to help them conduct SASO, OOTW or Asymmetric threat scenarios.  The system will be offered as an add-on at the completion of Phase II to two simulation systems: OneSAF Objective System (OOS) andthe Automated Exercise and Assessment System (AEAS).The target market for commercial applications is the industrial and governmental entities that wish to understand the likes and dislikes of population segments.  It will also have value to organizations involved in public policy to predict the population?sresponse to certain stimuli ? this response may take the form of approval, position, or demeanor on a certain subject.

The widespread use of dynamic testing tools to detect these vulnerabilities has failed to halt or prevent the problem.  We propose thedevelopment of a semi-automatic tool for detecting these vulnerabilities statically.  Static approaches are superior to dynamic approaches because they compute properties for all possible executions of a program.  The proposed tool will use constraintanalysis on a program's variables and buffers to identify locations where buffer overruns can occur.  These locations, which may contain false-positives, will be sorted so that those most likely to be genuine faults appear first.  A user interface willallow the user to explore the program to determine the actual severity of the problem.  Our Phase I results show that we can already find previously undetectable vulnerabilities.  In Phase II we propose to improve the analyses to reduce the number of falsepositives, to further develop the user interface, and to identify and alleviate remaining barriers to success.  Furthermore, we will cultivate the connections we have made with commercial companies in Phase I in order to achieve commercial success in PhaseIII.",

        "abstract": "This  Small Business Innovation Research  Phase II project aims to make it much easier to create unit-level regression tests for Java programs. Their benefits are clear, but existing techniques for creating them are flawed because they are difficult to apply to existing code, and tool support requires modification of the target code. The innovation is to instrument a gold-standard version of the module of interest so that when a client application executes, all events that cross the boundary to the module are intercepted and logged to a file. Later, after the unit has been modified or extended, and without any further need for the client application, the events can be reconstructed and fed to the unit. The results are checked for consistency with the log, and discrepancies flagged as faults. This makes it much easier for a user to create a test suite for a module. The approach is made feasible by using Aspect-Oriented Programming, and object mocking. The research challenges are: how to devise techniques for tolerating permitted changes in the target module, and how to reduce the chances of a single failure triggering a profusion of cascading failures. The use of advanced static analysis techniques, including dependence analysis, is the key to solving these problems.\n\nIf successful,  this  system will help software development organizations reduce the cost of development and maintenance of their software assets while at the same time increasing its quality. It will help increase assurance of safety-critical software, such as in medical equipment, or flight-control systems, thus reducing the risk of damage to property and loss of life.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II will develop and test a prototype low-cost, high-efficiency transmitter for magnetic-resonance-imaging (MRI) systems. Existing MRI transmitters use conventional power amplifiers (PAs), which makes them inefficient and consequently large, heavy, and expensive. Phase I has demonstrated the feasibility of using developed high-efficiency amplification techniques to produce significantly more power from a given transistor, thus lowering the cost. Also demonstrated was the feasibility of using these amplifiers to produce the pulsed-RF signals used by MRI. Phase II will develop a prototype transmitter that combines high-efficiency power amplification with digital signal processing to provide both low cost and superior signal quality. This in turn will produce superior image quality, resulting in improved diagnostics. The transmitter will be organized into broadband RF-power modules that can be combined in building-block fashion to produce transmitters for different MRI applications. The prototype transmitter will be configured into a manufacture able form to facilitate transition to Phase-III commercialization. Finally, the prototype transmitter will be tested in an MRI system and images obtained will be compared to those obtained with a conventional transmitter.\n\nThe primary commercial application for the new transmitter is medical imaging. Every MRI system includes a high-power RF transmitter. The manufacturers of MRI systems purchase transmitters from smaller manufacturers. The RF transmitter is the most expensive subsystem, and keeping the cost down is of great interest. The building-block approach allows all market segments to be addressed, beginning with the lower-power \"1-T\" systems for specialized applications and moving subsequently to higher-power \"3-T\" systems for high-resolution whole body scans. The combination of lower cost and superior signal quality is expected to make the proposed transmitter very attractive to systems manufacturers.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The American Heart Association estimated the cost of cardiovascular disease in the United States in 2000 to be at $326.6 billion. This figure includes health expenditures and lost productivity resulting from morbidity and mortality. Heart failure is not a disease of the elderly or persons who live unhealthy lifestyles. The highest incidence occurs between 25-45 years of age. Although more patients are surviving their first myocardial infarction, they go on to develop progressive left ventricular dysfunction and end-stage heart failure. As a result, the incidence of congestive heart failure is increasing. Changes in gene expression profiles between normal tissue and diseased tissue can lead to identification of novel drug targets and to the development of drugs that will be able to interfere with disease development. Our hypothesis is that altered gene expression is the basis of the structural and functional changes that accompany the development of heart disease and that changes in gene expression profiles are important indicators of specific disease stages of heart failure. We predict that changes in the expression profile of a critical set of genes will be important indicators and diagnostic markers of heart disease. We have found that about 30 percent of the genes identified in our differential screening have no informative similarity to known genes in any of the public databases. These genes are excellent candidates as drug targets and/or as possible diagnostic markers.  \nOur specific aims are 1) To fully characterize selected genes based on their differential expression in heart failure; 2) To validate the potential targets identified in Phase 1 and prioritize these gene targets; 3) To determine if the levels of the corresponding gene products (proteins) have changed in a manner similar to the change in RNA levels; 4) To link information on the differences in gene expression and protein levels with consequences in cardiac myocytes and muscle strips by using adenoviral vectors to infect myocytes with transgenes that are over-expressed or knocked down (i.e., antisense); 5) To determine if changes in the gene expression pattern that we have identified in the turkey model are also present in the hearts of human patients with end-stage heart failure; 6) To produce the first \"human heart failure chip\"; 7) To patent novel therapeutic targets that have been identified and validated",

In the pilot test of the prototype module, the training significantly improved participant knowledge of fall prevention even though many participants had never previously used a computer. Phase II will expand the research to include a field test and follow-up study with participants in four states. Researchers will also develop and test Web-based versions of the modules.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   \nIt has been repeatedly emphasized in the BioSync Report that the development of better XAS detector systems is critical in solving the problem of detectors lagging behind synchrotron sources. The detector bottleneck encountered is in two areas: one is detector count rate limitation, and the other is its limited rejection rate of background in order to examine very dilute systems. By the development of the multilayer analyzer array detector (MAAD), we effectively increased the count rate, and therefore the efficiency of fluorescence detection. Now, we are proposing to largely increase the rejection rate by developing muitilayer analyzer pair array detectors (MAPAD). Our Phase I project has shown that such a detector can be made with a high rejection rate and a reasonable throughput. With two-stage rejection of primary and secondary multilayers, the rejection rate will exceed 200 times with a 15 to 20% throughput. With 28 double multilayer pairs, the detector will collect close to 2% total solid angle at 6 KeV. The anticipated gain on the effective photon counts will be as high as 40 times on very dilute systems. The detector can be made tunable in a large energy region, and easy to operate. With a flexible design, the detector can perform the pair rejection as well as the single multilayer rejection, just like a MAAD. Thus the detector can cover a large sample dilution range from a few mM down to 20 microM or a few ppm. For trace metal detection, the approachable concentration can go even lower. This kind of sensitivity should enable us to approach new systems, such as the examination of biological relevant metals in vivo as well as very dilute systems in environmental, material, physical and chemical research. The detector has a very good market potential benefiting efficient use of high flux beamlines. By expanding the XAS technique to new systems, the detector can potentially enter into new markets.",

To address this public health concern, Health Management Consultants of VA proposes to build upon the Phase I MetaKenkoh project, an Internet-based, real-life-activity game for children and their parents aimed at preventing/treating childhood obesity. Specific aims are to: 1) Expand the futuristic story of MetaKenkoh; 2) Enhance existing puzzles/games; 3) Create new puzzles/games and characters; 4) Incorporate additional graphics, animation, and sound; 5) Provide peer comparisons to enhance motivation; 6) Develop an embedded Instant Messenger system; 7) Incorporate Internet-enabled physical activity sensors; 8) Design a resource website for parents; 9) Evaluate impact of the game on user physical activity and nutritional intake. MetaKenkoh could be used as part of school health and wellness programs, as a health education component of physician practices, or as an independent intervention via on-line subscription.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  \nConventional hemotoxicity testing, performed primarily during the preclinical phase of drug development, is based on parameters obtained from mature cells in peripheral blood or organ morphology and, as such, has little predictive value. The in vitro hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell colony-forming assays (CFA) provide validated and highly predictive procedures capable of improving efficacy and safety for new drugs. Although the CFAs were first introduced in 1966, they have never been used routinely, other than for research purposes, because they are time-consuming to perform, require considerable expertise and experience, are very costly and the results have to be manually enumerated, thereby not only suffering from lack of subjectivity, but also high throughput capability. Our Phase I application proposed a complete modification of the conventional CFAs such that the read-out would be a non-subjective fluorescence or luminescence signal and the test system would be robust, easy-to-use, cost-effective and have high throughput capability. This new CFA-based platform is called HALO (Hematopoietic/Hemotoxicity Assays via Luminescence Output). In the preliminary report included in this proposal, we show that HALO is (a) capable of detecting all primary hematopoietic lineages simultaneously, (b) has multispecies capability allowing human, nonhuman primate, rat, mouse and even dog hematopoietic cells to be detected side-by-side and (c) has multitasking capability so that cell proliferation and apoptosis/necrosis can be measure in the same assay.  In addition, we have also used HALO in a specific application example to demonstrate the best time of day to administer the anti-cancer drugs, 5-fluorouracil and doxorubicin. In this Phase II application, we now propose 3 aims for refining the procedures to allow for automation, high throughput screening and validation.  In Aim 1, we plan to fully optimize the 1st generation HALO for stem and lineage-specific progenitor cell populations from different animal species. This will be the basis for the 2 nd generation multitasking HALO platform. In Aim 2 we will develop off-the-shelf staging leading to a marketable HALO kit for research and later clinical purposes and automation capability so that the assay can be \"ramped up\" to accommodate for high-throughput testing. Finally in Aim 3, the HALO platform will undergo standardization and intralaboratory validation so that multitarget, multilineage and multispecies hemotoxicity comparisons can be performed on anti-cancer drugs. Commercialization of HALO has already begun and we expect the use of HALO by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to increase substantially in the immediate future thereby increasing our market share. In addition, we also expect the first HALO research kit to be available within the next 6-12 months. As far as we are aware, HALO is the first in vitro, cell-based, assay system that can be used at all stages of drug development, from screening to patient monitoring during clinical trials. With research and other clinical applications, the HALO platform will be a very unique and profitable product.",

(Hi-Z) proposes to design, fabricate and test a prototype of the conceptual design for a miniature power-harvesting system, consisting of a thermoelectric generator (TEG) module, control electronics board, wireless sensor andtransceiver module to be used in health monitoring of the Navy equipment. TEG modules harvest power from the temperature difference between the hot equipment surfaces and the colder ambient air and Hi-Z has demonstrated the feasibility of such powerharvesting in two previous Navy applications. The conceptual design is based on the actual thermal environment data as provided by the NSWCCD and for the equipment that satisfies the Navy RSVP criteria and on the smallest COTS transceiver identified at thetime. In order to satisfy the small design volume goal of this SBIR, Hi-Z is using its innovative multi-layer quantum well (QW) TEG technology whose performance has been verified in recent tests with breadboard thermoelectric couples. QWs are nanostucturedmultiplayer films that can be packaged in a very small volume and, since they produce large voltages, a DC/DC converter is not required. For Phase II Option Hi-Z proposes to fabricate one or more prototype TEG systems for installation and testing on theNavy equipment. By using its innovative QW technology, Hi-Z was able to develop a design concept that satisfies the Navy's need for small power harvesting generators to power shipboard health monitoring wireless sensor systems. Benefits to the Navy forusing this concept are in cost reduction associated with the elimination of batteries and tethered wires, large reduction of personnel engaged in CBM and significant reduction in down time by providing early detection of abnormal conditions in criticalequipment. There is plenty of potential for power harvesting from the Navy shipboard equipment especially with TEGs because all that is required is a temperature differential and a small surface area of the equipment for the attachment of the TEG. QW TEGsare also suitable for high temperature applications because they can withstand very high temperatures and they actually operate more efficiently at high temperature differentials. Other applications are for health monitoring of equipment in commercialships, aircraft and launch vehicles, nuclear and steam power plants, trucks, automobiles, consumer appliance industry and security and surveillance industry. The QW technology also has wider applications, such as in cooling of electronic circuit boards.The QW technology is already viable with the demonstrated 14% efficiency. Once higher potential efficiencies of over 20% are experimentally confirmed, this promising QW technology will become even more competitive in many commercial applications, such asrefrigeration where it will have the distinct advantage of having no moving parts nor fluids.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is the specific aim of this proposal to develop an advanced adhesive and dental restorative system that is more quickly placed and reliable than current products.  Thus improving patient satisfaction and general health care.  The method for achieving this objective is to design a dental bonding agent and restorative system that are structurally controlled at the nanoscopic (1-10nm) level through the macroscopic level.  Natural tooth contains both nanoscopic and macroscopic length scales.  The development of such a restorative system will maintain the continuum of structure from the natural tooth through the adhesive and restorative system thereby improving compatibility and physical properties.  Nanoscopic building blocks based on the nontoxic polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) Nanostructured TM Chemical technology will be utilized in combination with conventional macroscopic and nanoscopic metal oxide fillers to design a dental restorative which benefits from multi-length scale structural control (nano to macro).  POSS-Monomers will be utilized as isotropic 1.5nm structural segments in the base restorative resin.  In this capacity the resulting nanostructured resin will provide an enhanced filler-resin interaction and lower shrink characterists as demonstrated in Phase I.  Improvement of the filler-resin interface will also result in improved mechanical properties and reduced degradation of the restorative system.  The performance of restoratives are also governed by the nature and integrity of the inherent bondline formed with natural tooth. Here again the design of bonding agents which utilize 1.5nm monomeric POSS building blocks provide a more natural interface with the 2nm sized apatite crystals present in natural tooth and with the l nm-10nm structural segments incorporated into the proposed restorative.  Overall better bonding to the tooth and restorative per Phase I findings.  By utilizing both nano (lnm-10nm) and macroscopic length scales in a dental restorative and bonding system, a continuation of length scale and properties with those in natural tooth can be acheived. It is the intent of the proposed Phase II work to develop a prototype system for transition to Phase III.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Diagnosis of auto-immune and connective tissue diseases such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, Sjorgren syndrome and scleroderma often makes use of an Immunofluorescent assay (IFA) for antinuclear antibodies (ANA). More detailed diagnostic support may also utilize an IFA test for double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). IFA tests detecting Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Autoantibodies (ANCA) are diagnostic for systemic necrotizing vasculitis and glomerulonephritis. All these IFA tests require significant laboratory preparation time from highly trained technicians using current, manual techniques. The VisiQuant system developed as a prototype in Phase I, combined with Hyperion's Hyprep automated assay preparation system will automate both preparation and reading of the IFA tests, achieving significant cost savings and potential error reduction. During the Phase II project period, an updated VisiQuant Microscope will be introduced along with improved ANA assay and preparation procedure. The assay will be improved by applying results of a study of assay parameters and conditions. The Microscope will be upgraded by incorporating engineering enhancements to the optics and electronics, including features to optimize the joint operation of the Microscope with the HyPrep, and software improvements to the fluorescence intensity algorithm. New test kits for dsDNA based on Crithidia luciliae and for ANCA will be developed, tested and brought to market. Development work in automated image classification will lead to a complementary product that finds the best match to each sample image from a standard ANA image pattern library. Further development of the image classification software will be done based on input from the consultants. This will lead to an advanced Image Classification system to be brought to market at the end of the Phase II period. Image classification to support ANCA test will be started but is not expected to be ready for market until after completion of this project. These developments will result in Hyperion obtaining more than 18% share of the global market for autoimmune IFA based IVD tests by 2010. The development team includes personnel with many years of experience in dye chemistry, immunology in vitro device development, instrument development and image processing.",

Thisrequires direct digitization of the RF signal, followed by down-conversion in the digital domain, replacing the nonlinear analog mixer in a conventional receiver. Superconductor ADCs, sampled up to 20 GHz rates, have already demonstrated superiorperformance in low-pass architectures. New circuit designs are needed to enhance performance. Our objective is to achieve at least 100 dB (16 effective bits) of SNR and SFDR over a 10-100 MHz bandwidth at frequencies up to 2 GHz, which is not achievable byconventional electronics. During Phase I, several alternative circuit architectures were investigated, new ADCs were designed and a development plan was established. In Phase II we will follow this plan to build three different wideband second-orderdelta-sigma ADC modulators, each sampled at 40 GHz, that are tailored for different sections of the communications spectrum. Starting with the Phase I Option, ADC circuits will be fabricated and integrated with programmable digital mixer and decimationfilters in Phase II. A complete receiver will be built and demonstrated.An improved bandpass analog-to-digital converter is an essential enabling component for next generation software radio. Elimination of frequency and protocol-specific analog componentsby broadband digitization, followed by digital processing, enables agile, inter-operable, reconfigurable communication transceivers as required by the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS). While the performance demands of commercial wireless communicationssystems lag well behind those of the military, software radio will pervade the commercial world in the next few years.

Anticipated benefits of the device include it being self-contained, faster, and more simple to use than existing forensic toolsets, and its ability to read a wide variety of different media.At the successful completion of Phase II, the device developed will be usable by DoD personnel on information gathering missions and for counter-terrorism efforts, parole officers searching subject''s computers to ensure compliance with all conditions ofrelease, auditors and law enforcement personnel faced with large amounts of media to examine, and even parents checking on their children's use of a home computer.",

        "abstract": "70397S02-II   The gradients associated with plasma-based accelerators, such as a laser wakefield accelerator, are much larger than those in conventional accelerators.  To realize the potential of a laser wakefield accelerator and obtain high-energy electrons, it is necessary to (1) provide a means to guide the laser beam, and (2) stage the accelerating module to reduce dephasing.  This project will address both issues and perform experiments to achieve electron energies approaching 1 GeV.  Gas-filled capillary discharges will be employed to optically guide the laser beam over extended distances.  To mitigate dephasing in a laser wakefield accelerator, two or more capillaries, placed end-to-end with increasing plasma density, will be configured.  In Phase I, design parameters were obtained using scaling models and reduced analytical models.  Particle-in-cell simulations, employing massively-parallel, fully-electromagnetic codes, were then employed to refine the design.  Phase II will conduct experiments that employ a 10 Hz, 10 TW, and 50 fs Ti-sapphire laser beam.  A fraction of the beam will be extracted and utilized for the injector, and the rest will be used to drive a wakefield in a plasma channel made up of several capillaries, each of which has a uniform density along the direction of propagation.  Accelerated electrons will be detected and analyzed by employing dipole magnets, ?erenkov radiation, and nuclear activation.

To achieve this our phase I objective was to develop a Xenopus oocyte assay to identify and isolate novel peptidyl agonists / antagonists of the chemokine receptors. In phase I feasibility studies we developed an assay using the CCR3 receptor, and the chemokine eotaxin as a positive control. We also developed a peptide expression system, and initiated library screening.In phase II studies we propose to extend our assay development to all known chemokine receptors, and to characterize the agonist and antagonist effectors isolated in our assay.

        "abstract": "The proposer (IME) has applied giant magnetoresistance (GMR) to pioneer a novel method, called magnetoresistive trimming (MT), to balance GMR circuits resistively to an accuracy unmatchable with the presently used technique of laser trimming. Unlike lasertrimming, MT is reversible, can adjust the resistance continuously, can be automated, and uses very little chip area, The project objectives are (a) to develop fully the MT technique, and (b) to apply it to the development of an ultrafast all-metalrandom-access memory called PRAM1. The project will (1) develop the MT technique for general use by circuit designers; (2) design, fabricate and test an integrated 1 Kbit PRAM1 chip with trimmed GMR support circuitry; and (3) design a fully integrated 8Mbit PRAM1 chip. The results are anticipated to create sufficient MT data to allow circuit designers to apply this technique directly in any system where GMR electronics might find use. The level of memory-chip integration to be achieved using trimmed GMRcircuitry is expected to realize PRAM1 read and write times on the order of 10 ns and to cut the number of read pulses by half compared to that using a conventional sample-and-hold circuit.MT has the potential of becoming a niche industry by enablingpreviously impossible chip applications. Its use in memory-chip design will lead to an inherently radiation-hard, compact, ultrafast, random-access memory for military and commercial space-environment applications such as satellite communications.",

Within this paradigmshift approach, embedded diagnostics improvements are being pursued through the evaluation of improved sensed features, artificial intelligence methods, and more detailed consideration of available situational data from bus monitors and environmentalsensors. In addition, an ambiguity group analysis that employs data fusion is being developed to assist the at-wing, automated test equipment, to rank probable causes. The information continuity through the maintenance and logistics systems is best enabledwith a suitable open architecture protocol, such as those based upon CORBA or XML implementations of OSA-CBM. The approach allows the diagnostics results, symptoms evaluated, and operational/environmental conditions to be more easily captured in a databasethat allows for further data mining, clustering, case-based reasoning, and other knowledge discovery methods. The proposed work addresses the development of embedded diagnostic/prognostic avionics health management technologies that will provide dramaticimprovement to the current state of avionics diagnostics and repair. This will, in turn, improve overall mission readiness by decreasing the downtime for repair and total number of repair instances. The development and integration of embedded diagnosticsand prognostics within avionics system and support test equipment will provide many benefits including: improved safety associated with system operations; reduced life cycle or total ownership costs; optimized maintenance intervals and prioritized taskperformance; and increased combat readiness/availability of military systems.

Actuators are complex mechanisms utilized in various aircraft systems from flight control surfaces tolanding gear, cargo doors and weapon systems. Impact proposes to mature its developed prognostic modeling paradigm for actuator fault detection and failure progression to produce specific modules that could be used on the F/A-18 Servocylinder Test Stand(STS). Impact plans to leverage its previous experience in developing PHM algorithms for hydraulic pumps, gearboxes, and engine control system components. The automated reasoners will process data from the flight control system using a combination ofdeveloped physical models, signal processing techniques, neural network modeling, advanced feature and knowledge fusion strategies, classification algorithms, and an evolving array of prognostics methods. The algorithms will account for specific conditionsand uncertainties to determine the existence of faults and, whenever possible with sufficient historical trending, the remaining useful life of the actuator and its critical, life-limited components. Upon completion of this proposed Phase II effort, Impactwill validate the developed automated reasoner and software package on available flight control actuator data and demonstrate its real-time capabilities using a customized graphical interface. The realization of such an automated, prognostic reasoningpackage will significantly enhance the maintainer's ability to schedule maintenance activities, optimize operational life cycles, and reduce the overall logistics footprint. The capabilities of the automated PHM package will include the ability to assessactuator health through sensor observables, apply model-based and data-driven approaches to identify evolving problems, estimate uncertainties in measurements and properties, and predict fault evolution with confidence bounds. The actuator prognostichealth monitoring software package is targeted towards the F/A-18 STS within this Phase II effort, but the diagnostic and prognostic software modules generated under this program will contain many generic elements that can be transitioned to a broad rangeof other applications. The techniques used could be adapted and implemented in a wide range of military aircraft (manned and unmanned) as well as commercial applications in the civilian aviation community (passenger aircraft, cargo transports, businessjets, private aircraft, etc.). The software could be applied as an on-board, at-wing, or depot-level maintenance strategy. The developed technologies could also be applied to land and water vehicle drive systems, industrial actuation systems, fluid powertransmission, and robotic applications. Better diagnosis of actuation systems and more accurate time-to-failure predictions will reduce the risk of safety-related system failures and decrease costly inspection routines as well as premature componentreplacements by using a risk-based, maintenance optimization technique (Condition-based Maintenance).",

(ISC) constructed an early prototype cyclone vapor sampling system with an integrated surface heater to extract explosives and ERC vapors from soil samples and to deliver the extracted vapors to a chemical detector.  Thephysical design of the cyclone unit and its operating parameters were highly optimized.  Phase I results are very promising.  In its current state, the cyclone module excludes particulates from the collected sample vapors, which is helpful in minimizingcontamination of the detector, and can operate in crosswinds of up to 4 mph without significant loss of sample vapors to the ambient air.  With the prototype sampling system interfaced to ISC's ultra-sensitive Laser IMS system, the ability to detect ppmppb concentrations of TNT and RDX in two types of soil was demonstrated, with a response time significantly less than one second.  By the end of Phase I, a prototype device will be available for field testing.  In Phase II, the design of the cyclone unitand the sample heater will be further optimized for a portable unit, and all components will be combined and modified as necessary to work as a complete system and to minimize size, weight and power consumption.Implant Sciences Corporation has developed anexplosives detection system which uses a cyclone vapor sampling module to extract trace explosives and ERC vapors from the environment and to direct the vapors into an ultra-sensitive Laser IMS system. This technology can be used to create a rapid-responsechemical detector system to confirm or disprove the presence of buried land mines with a false-positive response rate substantially lower than those of currently employed portable explosives detectors.  Since the detection of buried land mines is moredifficult than many explosives detection tasks, the technologies developed in this effort could easily be adapted for use in general explosives detection, for which there is a large and growing application base in the strengthening of homeland security andin improving the security of, e.g., the airline, shipping, power and chemical industries.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Choroidal melanoma is the most common primary ocular malignancy, with some 1500 new cases reported yearly in the United States. These tumors are both sight- and life-threatening. The COMS trial for medium choroidal melanomas, demonstrated that 125Iodine radioactive plaque treatment alone, without enucleation, does not increase mortality. Medium-sized choroidal melanomas can be treated and the eye and some vision preserved by application of 125Iodine brachytherapy. However, the dose distribution generated by the currently used \"seeded\" plaques is non-uniform and highly complex. It is extremely difficult if not impossible to accurately achieve the desired radiation dose distribution at varying points within the eye and even within the tumor. After treatment, greater than 40% of eyes have experienced significant radiation associated ocular complications.  This Phase II program intends to develop an improved brachytherapy plaque for the treatment of choroidal melanoma. The source would be manufactured through a process by which the 125Iodine distribution on the surface of the plaque could be designed to provide a prescribed dose distribution.  Such development would provide better dose uniformity than the current seed plaque and would permit the dose distribution to be contoured to conform to the specific tumor. Such development would also provide a measure of customization to the plaque design, providing accommodations and clearances around interferences such as the optic nerve. Additionally, such plaques would achieve a high degree of customization of the dose rate, allowing the treatment time to be specified within very narrow limits.  This plaque would be thinner than the current seeded plaques, which would provide a lesser degree of discomfort to the patient. This plaque would be designed to be reusable, greatly reducing the cost for this portion of the treatment. A conformal brachytherapy plaque using 125Iodine can be an effective treatment device for this cancer.",

These cells have been partially characterized and preliminary transport studies suggest that they have characteristics more similar to the small intestine than the Caco-2 cell model. In Phase II, further characterization of these cells will be done. We will examine site-specific differences between the cell lines and determine if passage number or differentiation state effect cellular function. Reproducibility studies of the transport systems will lead to development of a commercial product that can be shipped in a ready to use format. The proposed transport models will be designed to be superior to the current model and serve as the new gold standard for intestinal cell line testing. The addition of these unique transport models, cell cultures and RNA and protein extracts from these cell lines will expand INCELL's products and services capabilities and allow INCELL to capture the majority share of the current markets.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The problems in sleep medicine caused by the cost; access and variety of sleep laboratory testing have led to increasing use and demand for home testing particularly for evaluation of suspected sleep apnea.  The definition of sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD) has, however, expanded to include flow-limited breathing events. Assessment of these events and of hypopneas requires quantitative analyses of the airflow not provided by thermal sensors. Nasal air pressure, however, provides a quantitative measurement of airflow sufficiently accurate to detect both hypopneas and flow-limited breaths. In this project an untethered, miniature, self-applied ambulatory unit (AirTrac) will be built to measure airflow from nasal pressure and record data for PC download. The AirTrac will detect apneas, hypopneas and flow-limited breaths and provide basic event rates and visual data display on the PC. In phase I a prototype system was developed and found to produce results similar to that of a polysomnogram. In phase II automatic data analyses programs will be integrated into the monitor and the system tested in clinical trials. This device could facilitate clinical screening and treatment evaluations for SRBD as part of the continuum of care in sleep medicine and could also expand opportunities for clinical research.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Allergens found in the home derived from dust mites, animal dander, cockroaches and fungi are commonly associated with the development of asthma. Reducing allergen exposure is a primary goal of asthma management, yet there are no simple tests that enable allergic patients and consumers to measure allergen exposure in the home. In Phase I, the feasibility of using a lateral flow test for mite Group 2 allergen as part of home based allergen detection kit was demonstrated. The test detected mite allergen in dust samples within 10 minutes, correlated with enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) results, and was used to monitor allergen levels in homes and changes in allergen levels following an intervention procedure (steam cleaning). The aims of Phase II are to optimize tests for mite allergen and to investigate the hypothesis that using the test as a tool to educate patients about allergen exposure will encourage implementation and compliance with allergen avoidance procedures. The predictive value of tests for mite Group 1 and Group 2 allergens will be compared to select the optimal test for allergen assessment. A randomized controlled trial will study allergic patients compliance with avoidance procedures, comparing patients who use the mite test on a regular basis, with those who have educational materials but no test. Rapid tests will be developed for cat, dog and cockroach allergens, with the aim of producing a single allergen test card for multiple allergens that can be used to screen for allergen exposure in the home. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Effective consumer tests for allergens are not available. INDOOR Biotechnologies will market the test through distributors that sell allergen control products, indoor air quality testing services, and household cleaning products. Several companies have expressed strong interest in marketing the allergen tests. Our goals are to market 100,000 tests by the end of Phase II. Lateral flow technology will enable tests for food and latex allergens to be developed, as well as a new generation of rapid allergen diagnostic tests using genetically engineered allergens. The Phase II project will result in the development of consumer based allergen tests that will improve asthma management using environmental control procedures.",

        "abstract": "Design for producability is the key to reducing ship construction costs.  The most direct way to ensure that design for producability goals are met is to automate portions of the design process, enforcing producability requirements in software.  IndustrialPlanning Technology Inc has developed an automated design and planning technology that is based on the use of high fidelity fabrication and assembly simulators.  This technology yields lower construction costs than traditional rule-based design forproducability, and does not require the development of comprehensive design rules.Distribution systems (piping, cabling, HVAC) represent between 25% and 40% of the construction cost for Naval ships.   This project has established the feasibility of developing an automatic design for producability/maintainability tool, which couples anautomatic 3D spatial router for ship piping, cabling, and HVAC with Industrial Planning Technology's construction planning and simulation tools.  The benefits of this approach are lower construction cost through optimized design for producability, reduceddesign costs, and lower total cost of ownership through automated design for maintainability.  The technology would be packaged as a plug-in to existing commercial ship design systems. Anticipated savings are $13 million per year in construction and design costs per year for U.S. shipyards, and $1.1 billion dollars in total life cycle savings for Navy programs over the next 50 years.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in Army field feeding equipment offer improved kitchen efficiency and personnel usability.  Inherently loud, noxious, complex, and over-sized diesel generators are still required to provide small amounts of electric power.  The Army isseeking quieter, more efficient approaches capable of cogenerating electricity and hot water.  Stirling Technology Company (STC) has developed a family of quiet, long-life, maintenance-free Stirling cycle generators.  Prototype RG-1000 1 kW(e) Stirlinggenerators, in a cogeneration configuration, are being tested by a European client (ENATEC) who has licensed them for the European residential cogeneration market.  ENATEC plans to mass produce these at competitive prices for the individual homeowner,beginning in 2004.  STC plans to heavily leverage their ENATEC collaboration to meet Army needs in a high-performance, cost-effective manner.  Phase I objectives to demonstrate a diesel-fired radiant matrix burner and to produce a StirlingMicro-Cogeneration System (SMCS) conceptual design were met, and even exceeded by successfully demonstrating two fundamentally different burner concepts.  Factors supporting Phase II success and commercial viability include:  1) proven long lifemaintenance-free Stirling engine, 2) simple inexpensive cylindrical heater head, 3) adaptation of proven catalytic diesel burner, 4) leveraging from ENATEC low cost mass production cogenerator, and 5) focus on clearly identified market needs.The STCStirling Micro Cogeneration System (SMCS) will eliminate the need for noisy, dirty, high-maintenance and inefficient internal combustion generators to supply electricity separately from thermal energy.  With the small cooling fan as the loudest component,the Stirling cycle generator operates in virtual silence.  Without the need for lubricating oil or periodic maintenance of any kind, STC's RG 1000 is very clean and easy to operate, with no harmful or unsanitary fluids to dispose of.  It can also be usedin areas where no trained service or maintenance personnel are available.  The inherent long life and high reliability of STC's Stirling cycle generator is validated by its recent selection by NASA and DOE for their advanced radioisotope space powergenerators, with high profile missions up to 14 years in duration.  Low mass production costs resulting from the European residential cogeneration program, combined with superior fuel efficiency, will make the Stirling very cost-effective to operate andclearly preferable for providing combined heat and power cogeneration.  The SMCS can provide heat and power at any time of the day or night, and keep providing continuous heat and electricity for as long as it's needed.  Related commercial applicationsinclude off-grid residential power, recreational vehicle power, and residential/light commercial cogeneration.  The latter market is driven by the expanding U.S. energy crisis, and is supported by the advanced European residential cogeneration status.  Theproposed Phase II program will further expedite entry into these and other markets.",

It is associated with deterioration in quality of life and causes significant concern to many women. Current surgical therapies have significant morbidity associated with them. Therefore, a minimally invasive, nonsurgical treatment would be a great solution. We propose to address this challenge using microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology to develop a valve suitable for use in an artificial urethral sphincter. The Intraurethral Continence Prosthesis (INCOPRO) will use an innovative sphincter design based on biomimetic polymer technology to control urine flow. During Phase I, we successfully obtained proof-of-concept of the polypyrrole valve mechanism including testing in human urine. Further, we demonstrated micro-miniaturization using a MEMS fabrication process. In Phase II, we propose to further this work by developing a matrix of microvalves, which serves as a functional sphincter. We aim to extensively test the performance of the valve in vitro in a phantom model and further evaluate it in vivo in a porcine model. It is our long-term goal to incorporate this technology into a miniature device suitable for use in patients suffering from the debilitating problem of stress incontinence.",

This tool is intended for use with adolescents (aged 13-18 years) at the outset of substance abuse treatment or upon entry into the juvenile justice system to guide treatment planning. The numbers of adolescents with diagnosed substance abuse problems is distressing both in treatment facilities and in the criminal justice system. Reported statistics do not include youth with substance abuse issues who are institutionalized or otherwise in trouble but have not been identified as misusing substances. Adolescent alcohol and other drug use frequently occurs in a constellation with other risky behaviors. The financial and societal costs of alcohol and/or drug abuse by adolescents are high. Early substance abuse can significantly delay attainment of normative developmental tasks, and estimated health and criminal costs for a lifetime of heavy drug abuse are staggering. Such considerations highlight the importance of early assessment and treatment for adolescents who are struggling with substance use issues. In Phase I, a paper-version scripted flowchart of the ASI-A-MV was created.

The approach is to directly address teenagers' most-cited reasons for using drugs and alcohol: social pressures and the need and desire to feel as good as possible. The aim is to use innovative filmmaking to convince teenagers that long-term pursuit of healthy, engaging, meaningful endeavors is a better tool than exogenous substances for creating a sustainable \"high,\" and can provide peak experiences rivaling those attainable with drugs or alcohol. The product will be produced with the recognition that an entertainment value is the essential vehicle for information transfer striving to effect behavior. Imaginative visual solutions and the drama of real people seeking long-term fulfillment will engage viewers in ways that exceed expectations for science education media.  The product will be targeted toward teens, but also reach parents and the general public, aiming to generate discussion that can positively affect the social dimension of substance abuse. The 90-minute film, designed to be presented in four parts for classroom screenings and two parts for television, will complement current prevention strategies such as public service announcements, but in a longer form that can fully explore the meaning neuroscience has for viewers.

The instructional components will be evaluated at an existing MOUT site or similar training area. The module developed for the evaluation will consist of a range of critical OFW system skills with an emphasis on effective utilization ofunmanned systems and managing data from multiple sensors. Virtual environments utilizing commercially-available simulation engines will be used to prototype and conduct initial tests of the training modules and user interface before evaluation at the MOUTsite.The proposing organization, Information in Place, Inc., is uniquely qualified to perform this project because of its strengths in instructional design, mixed reality software development, human factors engineering, and Army subject matter expertise.Theresulting instructional package will enable the development of powerful new embedded training methodologies for use with OFW and related programs within the Future Combat Systems (FCS) Family of Systems. This will help ensure the U.S. Army maintainstraining superiority as it acquires and fields its next generation combat systems. These instructional methodologies should empower individual soldiers and unit trainers to have more control over their training while maintaining the highest possiblestandards.

These results will beintegrated into a signal processing concept which includes hardware and software interfacing issues regarding the AEGIS legacy system. In the Phase II option, an optimized signal processor architecture will be developed and the algorithm mapped into theappropriate hardware configuration.The MBNA technology will be ready at the end of Phase II for technology transition into the AEGIS radar system.

Usually the consequences are drastic, as when the USS Greenville collided with the Japanese fishing boatM/V EHIME MARU, with the tragic loss of nine lives and significant political repercussions. These collisions have emphasized the weakness of acoustic methods in avoiding collisions. We have investigated in Phase I the use of electric field sensors to fillin the gaps left by acoustic sensors at medium ranges for detecting surface and submerged vessels at distances useful for avoiding collisions. The Phase I research verified useful detection ranges (up to 1000 m), investigated noise sources on E-Fieldsensors implanted on a moving submersible, and proposed mitigation strategies. Work in Phase II will test these noise mitigation concepts with a laboratory test and two at-sea experiments, as well as improve upon the theoretical E-Field noise estimationsfor turbulence, and improve our algorithms derived for target bearing and range estimation. We will also mount E-Field sensors onto a submarine and test it in a real-world situation against a variety of vessels and towed targets, to demonstrate theeffectiveness of E-Field sensing for collision avoidance.",

        "abstract": "The problem of detection, classification and localization of multiple ground targets, e.g. trucks and tanks, using arrays of unattended passive acoustic sensors is extremely complicated due to various compounding factors. These include: variability andnon-stationarity of target acoustic signatures, signal attenuation, loss of coherence and fading effects as a function of range and Doppler, effects of wind noise and weather/environmental conditions on the sensory data, competing clutter with similarcharacteristics as those of the targets. In addition, the presence of multiple closely spaced targets can significantly complicate the detection/classification, data association and localization processes, especially when the targets are allowed to remainclose together in tight formations. Consequently, in this project our objectives are to develop, simulate and implement new high-resolution and robust schemes for providing real-time bearing angle estimation and subsequent classification, localization andtracking of different types of narrowband and wideband sources from their acoustic signatures. Furthermore, in developing, simulating and implementing our proposed schemes we will pay particular attention to power consumption and size constraints, which inturn place severe constraints on the complexity of the DSP and communication systems for these arrays. There is a substantial potential for these results to achieve broad-based technology transfer and commercialization capabilities. There are severalgovernmental agencies and companies that are involved in the development of various automatic target detection, classification and tracking systems for different active and passive sensor platforms. The algorithms developed in this project are general andcan be applied to a multitude of similar problems. Therefore, the results of this research could potentially lead to the development of various other acoustic signature analysis systems in a wide market encompassing military and commercial areas. The mainobjective of this Phase II work is to develop, simulate and implement efficient and robust target detection, tracking and classification algorithms for realistic battlefield environments using arbitrary array structures of acoustic sensors. This willprovide not only a solution to the problem of multiple source separation and classification, but also augment the capabilities of the acoustic signature analysis systems presently in use by the Government Labs by providing real-time target/environmentalinformation in realistic operating conditions. The proposed work will also produce a software implementation of all the developed algorithms using MATLAB toolboxes.The potential for this study for a broad-based technology transfer and parternship with other stronger companies is extremely high. There are numerous military, commercial and environmental applications that can benefit from the outcome of the proposedresearch. The development and commercialization of the proposed technologies would lead to the advances in many similar systems covering a wide market potential. Our commercialization strategy would be to identify at least a couple of different potentialapplication areas/markets for the developed technology. The emphasis throughout the proposed research would be on development of algorithms that can easily be implemented on commercially available DSP hardware and COTS components. The implementation ofthese algorithms would also take into account the high throughputs that are required by the targeted real-time applications. Design and implementation of the custom hardware and actual field tests will be addressed in the Phase IIT and Phase II of thisproject,respectively.",

The proposed Phase II program emphasizes developing prototype implant devices to rapidly commercialize this Phase I nanotechnology. The benefits of exceptional coating to substrate bond strength enable expansion of the HA nanocoatings market to hips, knees, and dental applications. Achieving 100% crystallinity and density at the HA substrate interface with electrophoretic deposited HA nanocoatings assures no degradation during implant service. Functionally graded HA nanocoatings can be generated at the HA tissue interface, thus promoting optimal bioactivity. The Phase II specific aims include scale up of the experimental HA bath nanocoating composition to pilot-scale production of prototype medical implants; demonstration of the HA nanoparticles coating on prototype medical implants, such as hip, knee, and dental implants; and demonstration of superior performance of the coated prototype devices with extended lifetime in-vivo, using an animal model.

        "abstract": "Multilayer chemical protective gloves that provide 24 hours of protection against chemical warfare agents while being more resistant to petroleum oils and flames than the currently used butyl rubber gloves will be developed. This will be achieved usingaqueous nanocomposite elastomeric coatings specially formulated for use in newly designed multilayer gloves. In phase 1, InMat demonstrated that a few mils of its nanocomposite coatings offer the potential to provide the same 24 hours of protectioncurrently available with butyl rubber gloves that are 25-30 mils thick. In Phase 2, we will combine nanocomposite coatings with flame and petroleum oil resistant Neoprene to produce new multilayer gloves. The first neoprene based nanocomposite coatingswere developed during phase 1. They have improved adhesion to neoprene, as well as improved resistance to petroleum oils. Despite the higher permeability of Neoprene, the nanocomposites have gas barrier properties similar to InMat's earlier butyl basedformulations, and offer distinct advantages for use in multilayer chemical protective gloves. The final design will not only provide the required improvements over currently used butyl gloves but also empower soldiers by being thinner, thus improving theirability to perform manual tasks while protecting them from chemical warfare agents. We will develop chemical protective gloves (CPGs) with the following properties:1. Improved resistance to hydrocarbon solvents and petroleum based greases and oil2. Improved flame resistance3. Better barrier to chemical warfare agents without any increase in glove thickness.4. Adequate protection in a larger number of environments without requiring the use of multiple gloves.5. Better manual dexterity than using multiple gloves.6. Improved performance that meets the needs of the chemical and pharmaceutical industries.7.

Commercial applications for this technology have been disclosed through independent research and market analysis.  In particular, the aluminum industry is interested in surface modification techniques for aluminumalloys that do not contaminate or metallurgically alter the substrate during deposition.  Triboelectric Discharge Metallization (TDM) is the coating analogue of SSF that permits surface modification of these substrates with unique material properties.  TDMenables coating of aluminum alloys that was heretofore only marginally achievable with conventional thermal and plasma spray methods.  The military currently requires surface modification and coatings of aluminum alloys for thermal and optical control,corrosion protection, wear resistance, and joining.  The object of the Phase II research is to develop the TDM technology for military and industrial applications by reducing the technical risks so that Phase III commercialization is assured.  Design,fabrication, and characterization of a TDM engineering prototype system during Phase II is expected to accomplish this objective.The chief benefit of the TDM technology is an improved and lower cost method of coating and spray forming materials with uniquematerial properties.

In Phase I, we tested our novel ultrapotent PARP inhibitor, INO-1001, and observed a dramatic reduction in lung injury: INO-1001 markedly increased the PaO2/FiO2 (PF) ratio and decreased neutrophil infiltration, wet-to-dry ratio, and lung lymph flow. In sheep challenged with smoke inhalation and Pseudomonal pneumonia, INO-1001 significantly increased the PF ratio and decreased peak airway pressure and pulmonary shunt fraction. The central objective of this Phase 2 SBIR is to establish the pathogenetic role of PARP activation in clinical smoke inhalation injury. We will utilize a prospective, randomized, double-blinded study of PARP inhibition in 200 patients admitted with acute smoke inhalation. Enrollment will include patients with all of the following characteristics: 1) thermal injury < 24 h old, 2) cutaneous burn injury > 20% BSA, 3) evidence of smoke inhalation (as evidenced by a majority of the following criteria: carboxyhemoglobin measured or back extrapolated > 40 % at the scene of trauma, carbonaceous sputum, an early decrease in PF ratio, blood tinged endotracheal secretions, or blackened bronchi by bronchoscopic exam), and 4) clinical judgment by the patient's physician that there is a high probability that the duration of mechanical ventilation will exceed 7 days. The clinical study will be conducted in 14 U.S. institutions with demonstrated clinical and research leadership in critical care of smoke inhalation injury. Administration of INO-1001 will be initiated prior to the onset of severe respiratory failure and continued for 5 days, the critical period of smoke inhalation induced pulmonary inflammation and respiratory insufficiency. Three primary clinical endpoints will be evaluated: 1) PF ratio, 2) duration of mechanical ventilation, and 3) dynamic pulmonary compliance, and an additional secondary endpoint, mortality, will be followed. The proposed clinical trial is expected to provide the foundation for FDA orphan drug approval of INO-1001 for treatment of acute smoke inhalation injury.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION: (provided by the applicant) The current application represents the first revision of a Phase 2 continuation of the Phase I NIH SBIR Grant 1 R43 DE13625 entitled \"A novel agent for the therapy of gingivitis\". The applicants are leaders in the research and preclinical development of novel, nitric oxide based innovative technologies for the development of periodontal disease. In the Phase I application, we have presented evidence that selenoethylguanidine (SEG) is a promising nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor with selectivity for the inducible nitric oxide synthase isoform (iNOS), and with an increased free radical scavenger activity, and proposed to perform pre-clinical studies in the rat to demonstrate its efficacy in gingivitis. The studies performed in the Phase I studies confirmed iNOS expression and peroxynitrite generation in periodontitis, and demonstrated the potent anti-inflammatory effects of SEG in a rat model of ligature-induced periodontitis. Further, we have demonstrated marked efficacy in the same experimental model with FP15, a novel peroxynitritie decomposition catalyst, and with PJ34, an inhibitor of the multifunctional nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. These additional strategies specifically target NO-related downstream inflammatory pathways of periodontal inflammatory disease. In the current application, we propose to perform pre-clinical studies with SEG, FP15 and PJ34 in order to develop a lead candidate as treatments for gingivitis/periodontitis. The specific aims of the present proposal are to synthesize large quantities of the three test compounds, and perform studies in beagle dog models of gingivitis and periodontitis in order to obtain definitive proof of principle that the agents can reduce the tissue injury and inflammation. Based on the efficacy and safety data, a lead agent will be selected for further development for the experimental therapy of gingivitis and periodontitis. Additional aims of the current submission are to complete the pre-clinical pharmaceutical testing (GMP synthesis, advanced formulation, stability, and local irritation tests), to reach the stage of investigational drug application to the FDA. Throughout the work, Inotek Corporation collaborates with scientists at the University of North Carolina, a leading group in the experimental therapy of periodontal inflammation, as well as with leading contract research organizations to conduct GMP synthesis, formulation work and GLP animal safety testing.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   \nOur goal is to develop a computerized algorithm for the electrocardiogram (ECG) that will facilitate the reliable and early detection of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The widely recognized value of thrombolytic therapy when delivered early in the management of patients with acute MI has made the development of such an algorithm especially important. Current algorithms for ECG interpretation do not provide the levels of sensitivity and specificity that are desirable. Our phase 1 findings demonstrate the feasibility of significant improvements in accuracy of identification of acute MI that may be achieved by taking into account age and gender and by factoring in such confounders as coexisting LVH, ST changes due to conditions other than acute myocardial infarction, and influences of prior infarcts. In phase 2, we plan to further improve corrections based on age and gender using a larger and more diverse database of ECGs. We will expand our database to include a much larger number of African American individuals and develop algorithms to account for differences between this population and Caucasians. We propose also to strengthen our algorithms that correct for several confounding factors. The databases we will use have associated non-ECG clinical information that provide confirmation of acute MI that will be used as the \"gold standard\" for assessing accuracy. Validation will also include comparisons of accuracy achieved by our developed system compared to the most recent commercially available ECG interpretive systems. The demonstration of significant diagnostic improvement will lead to considerable commercial opportunities based upon the high prevalence and incidence of acute myocardial infarction.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   \nHeart failure constitutes the most frequent and expensive hospital discharge diagnosis in the United States, costing annually over $10 billion with over 900,000 hospital admissions. Care of patients with chronic heart failure is most efficient when patients have frequent communication with their providers, a full understanding of their illness and the ability to control their health care by participation in clinical decisions. They are often managed by telephone reporting to a health professional. To facilitate patient to provider communication, Insight Telehealth Systems, Inc. supported by a Phase one SBIR, has developed an Internet-based communication system (ITS MyHealthfile) that provides heart failure patients with frequent communication with their health care providers for management of their medical status and allows patients to gain understanding and control of their health care. Re-hospitalization due to medication noncompliance, insufficient discharge planning or follow up, and failure to seek prompt medical treatment when symptoms are exacerbated, are reduced with communication systems that allow frequent contact between patients and their providers. The proposed Phase two study will expand the capability and functionality of our initial system design, and examine the economic and clinical outcome of this Internet based asynchronous communication system in a cohort of heart failure patients to determine the impact on cost of care, stability of heart failure status, and patient participation in their chronic disease management. Our research partner in this Phase-2 application is the Heart Failure and Transplantation Program of Temple University Medical Center, which is a nationally recognized program that has a large base of patients with class 3 or class 4 heart failure. We expect this program to improve communications between patient and health care providers, reduce the number of hospital admissions, and result in a more stable medical condition in these patients. Upon completion of this study, our communication product will be positioned to become an important commercial product for health care communication.",

Missing and dropout data are common nature in longitudinal studies. When the dropout process is related to the outcome process, it creates tremendous challenges in analyzing such data. No commercial software currently considers the dropout mechanisms in dealing with informative or non-random dropout. Consequently, the results are biased and misleading. The ultimate objective of this research is the development of a statistical software library for analyzing dropout data using both pattern mixture and selection model approaches. The approaches apply linear models, generalized linear mixed-effects models or GEE models for the response process and a regression using a Iogit, a probit or a Clog-log link for the dropout process. This library will include methods for parameter estimation, sensitivity analysis, graphical analysis, and model selection. The algorithms developing for parameter estimation include stochastic EM, likelihood maximization and imputation methods. Graphical tools will be developed for displaying dropout data, monitoring parameter convergence and diagnosing fitted values. Sensitivity analysis based on analytic and graphic methods are useful on testing the validity of the modeling assumptions. Comprehensive case studies and simulations will show the advantage and the applicability of the results of this investigation.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Optical biosensors are a class of instruments that can detect intramolecular interactions in real-time, without labels, and with high sensitivity. Their use has grown at a 25-40 percent annual rate since the early 1990's, and biosensors have been integrated into both drug development and diagnostics. However, optical biosensors have yet to be used with membrane proteins, a family of biological molecules that composes nearly half of current drug targets. The nature of biosensor detection restricts nearly all such devices to soluble molecules, and removal of membrane proteins from their native lipid environment destroys their structure. Ligand interactions with membrane proteins are responsible for a multitude of cell adhesion, signaling, and regulatory events. This diversity of function makes membrane proteins, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), important drug targets. Integral Molecular has developed a technology, the lipoparticle, based on retroviral structure that enables membrane proteins to be purified away from the surface of a cell while maintaining their structural integrity. In preliminary research, we demonstrated that lipoparticles can be produced with a diverse range of membrane proteins, retain the structure of those proteins, and can be used with biosensors for measuring binding interactions with GPCRs. The experimental objectives of our Phase I SBIR to integrate lipoparticles and biosensors have recently been successfully completed. Major sources of variability were optimized, including immobilization, regeneration conditions, and buffer conditions. Performance was evaluated for potential commercial applications, including specificity, sensitivity, and reproducibility. The product that results from these studies is expected to be used for research, diagnostics, and the development of therapeutic proteins and antibodies.

        "abstract": "In this Phase 2 project, we expect to develop two useful andinnovative systems for ground based nondestructive evaluation(NDE) of aircraft. First, a portable monitoring prototypeconsisting of wireless MicroElectroMechanical System (MEMS) andPolyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) sensors, and a telemetry systemwill be developed. Experience with PVDF sensors being tested onan SH-60 helicopter will assist this study greatly. The wirelesssensor and telemetry system are state-of-the-art technologiesthat have not yet been applied to aircraft NDE. The MEMS sensorsare low-cost, compact, passive, have unique identificationnumbers, conformable to the aircraft structure, and can beinterrogated in a wireless manner. The wireless capability allowsthe aircraft to be monitored all the time. Hence the maintenancecost can be saved significantly. Second, an integrated defectprocessing and prognostics tool will be developed. The tool willprovide defect detection and localization. The software toolintegrates the latest technology in prognostics to process thesensor signals. We can enhance sensor signals in noisyenvironment, detect and locate multiple defects, and, with properhistorical data and training files, provide both qualitative andquantitative (remaining life) system status information.         The proposed integrated wireless system for detecting and localizing defects is novel by itself and will have many practical applications in other diagnostics and prognostics applications.system combines the latest development in sensor and hardware technology with the most recent theories in diagnostics and prognostics and will provide valuable information that could save cost and improve reliability and availability for a wide range ofapplications.  The Navy and Boeing aircraft is our first target Phase 3 application.           As can be seen from the support letters and purchase order from Boeing (St. Louis), Lockheed Martin (Fort Worth), Boeing (Kennedy Space Center), Rolls-Royce (Indianapolis), and Boeing (Seattle), the proposed advanced NDE technology will be very useful forboth military and commercial systems such aircraft, Joint Strike Fighter, NASA systems, Future Combat Systems, etc.",

Our approach is to seamlessly integrate sensitive detection of intruders, communications with friendly forces, and tracking of ammunition units.Sophisticated algorithms for the analysis of radio and radar scans show great potential to limit false alarm rates due to small animals, etc. Due to the nature of UWB, the proposed system will be low power, low probability of intercept/detection, and ableto both operate in cluttered multi-path environments, and under adverse weather conditions. Under Phase I, we have thoroughly characterized UWB hardware for intrusion detection purposes. We have completed experiments and analytical analysis indicating thatsuch an intrusion detection system has a very low inherent false alarm rate. We have also show that we can track human intruders with \u00bf ft accuracy in real time using commercially available hardware.Apart from the direct military applications, robustmonitoring systems will have increased market potential due to recent emphasis on homeland security, and the protection of government institutions, national borders, and critical infrastructure.",

In addition, the end user should have a capability to achieve situationawareness through information requests/queries and to obtain automated status and alerts on their current location.  Currently, no systems exist with these unique capabilities.  The Phase I program identified the base requirements and specified a candidatesolution.

The architecture should allow for a great deal of flexibility and extensibility, allowing engineers to add multiple types and styles of real-time 2D and 3D visualization methods, different methods and formats of data input, and diversemethods of data manipulation and processing.  This type of flexibility provides utility to engineers at all levels of the design process, with each engineer using a common visualization platform.Our Phase I efforts proved the effectiveness this type of visualization system had in analyzing a single macro-level simulation scenario.  Our Phase II objective is to implement a prototype system that demonstrates this utility as it applies to a broadrange of M&S topics. Currently, there are a number of popular packages used for modeling and simulation, each with various forms of visualization capabilities.  Our aim is to define a new standard for M&S interactive visualization.  This can be achieved by providing avisualization environment that contains numerous standard utilities like interactive 2D and 3D plotting, but also provides an extensible visualization subsystem, the ability to read data in various formats and methods (which can be modified and extended),and most importantly can interface directly with the models created by the engineers.Such a system could emerge as the visualization standard for engineers working at the micro or macro level and across multiple disciplines.  This system could provide simulation designers with the ability to more effectively communicate the effectivenessof their system to customers, colleagues, and decision makers.",

These sheets will be stacked to produce a regenerator that will havesuperior performance (higher COP) than existing designs (stacked wire screen mesh or packed beds of spheres).  The performance improvement is expected because straight micro channels have a larger heat transfer/pressure drop ratio compared to screen meshor packed beds of spheres and because the porosity of the regenerator can be reduced to values much lower than can be achieved with the existing methods.In the Phase II effort, regenerators will be fabricated for two partners- Ball Aerospace Corporation and NIST.

The technologydeveloped in Phase I is based on a large array of micro-scale impinging jets, each of which produces a very high rate of heat transfer over a localized area.  This heat removal system is extremely compact and compatible with existing thermal managementcooling loops in navy radar systems.  The micro-jet cooling arrays (MJCA) principle of operation combines the well-known benefits of impinging jets (impingement cooling) with a unique ducting system that locally removes the impinging fluid of each jet,eliminates cross-flow, and prevents the flow fields of neighboring jets from interfering with each other. The local removal of fluid makes it possible to use large arrays (i. e. 100s x 100s) of isolated micro jets to achieve extremely high average heattransfer coefficients over relatively large areas (square inches).  Therefore, the system can easily cool areas as large as the 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm footprint of X band modules. The end product is a compact, efficient, heat-removal device that can be retrofitedinto many existing applications.

Once created, prevention content will be programmed onto a CD-ROM for delivery. The CD-ROM will lend itself to self-instruction and will engage girls through original graphics, voice-over and music audio tracks, and interactivity of decision-making responses, behavioral choice selection paths, and skills rehearsals, all presented in context of a previously tested five-step, problem-solving sequence. Field work for Phase II will occur in New York City public middle schools. Ten schools will be randomly assigned to each of two study arms: intervention and control. Consenting seventh-grade female students in all schools will complete a pretest outcome measurement battery, and those in the intervention schools will interact with the initial 10 sessions of the CD-ROM drug abuse prevention program. Posttest measurements in all schools will be followed by booster sessions for intervention schools and two semiannual outcome measurements for all schools. Students in intervention schools will complete the CD-ROM program in computer facilities under the supervision of regular school staff aided by members of the investigative team. Each session will last roughly 20 minutes. Independently, girls will interact with the program, finishing one session per week. Process measures during intervention delivery will quantify the quality of girls' interactions with the prevention, generate dose-response data for analytic blocking purposes, and provide feedback on essential parameters of intervention and experimental control. Outcome effects will be assessed by multivariate behavioral and psychosocial measures.

Individually, the MSIA and BRP technologies had been under development at Intrinsic Bioprobes Inc. for the last several years. Each technology brings a unique perspective to protein analysis. The MSIA approach utilizes affinity captures to selectively retrieve proteins from biological samples for subsequent MALDI-TOF MS analysis. When internal standards are incorporated in the analysis, absolute and/or relative quantitation of the assayed proteins can be achieved. On the other hand, the Bioreactive Probes aid in the thorough structural protein characterization via utilization of MALDI target surface-immobilized enzymes capable of digesting minute amounts of proteins. When combined together, the two technologies can yield a complexed approach that enables sensitive detection, quantitation and structural analysis of specific proteins from complex biological samples. In the Phase I Research, we propose to evaluate and demonstrate the reproducibility and sensitivity of the MSIA technology via execution of well-designed experiments using several model proteins and MSIA assays. In Phase II, we will demonstrate the robustness and the high-throughput capability of the combined MSIA-BRP approach. We will also proceed with the development of additional MSIA-BRP assays for proteins endogenously present in plasma and urine, some of which have been indicated as potential cancer biomarkers. A number of these proteins and assays will be utilized for the development and evaluation of a novel, relative quantitation MSIA approach. And finally, the assays and protocols designed in the Phase I and Phase II will be tested in a large-scale setting (200-300 samples, both urine and plasma) to validate the potential of the MSIA-BRP technology for population screening experiments. The ultimate product resulting from this Phase I-Phase II Research will be a combined MSIA-BRP platform and assays capable of assessing both qualitative and quantitative modulations in proteins analyzed directly from plasma, urine, or other biological fluid or tissue.",

Assays, utilizing antibody-derivatized affinity pipettes and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, will be developed for Apo-A, -C, -D, -E, -H and -J. These assays will have general use in studies investigating the quantitative modulation of, and point mutations and posttranslational modifications present in, the apolipoproteins. Phase I research will address the Specific Aim of optimizing affinity pipette chemistries for apolipoproteins. By reaching the Phase I milestone of high reproducibility, low non-specific binding qualitative assays (for the apolipoproteins when analyzed from small volumes (< 50 uL) of human blood), we will proceed into Phase II research. Phase II objectives include: 1) The use of enzymatically-active MALDI-TOF MS targets in conjunction with MSIA for structural characterization of the apolipoproteins, 2) The incorporation of quantitative methodologies into the assays, and 3) The development of a MSIA assay for common ApoE phenotypes. The final objective of the program is the development of kits and low-cost analytical platforms for the high-throughput analysis of  apolipoproteins. Upon supply to the public, the approach will find initial applications in proteomic investigations linking protein variants with disease and potential long-term applications as phenotyping assay for use in clinical/diagnostic or drug administration applications.",

The DAIDSPlatform will enable dynamic registration of network nodes, provide local support for software agents at each node, and enable information dissemination.  The DAIDS software architectural concept contains two key elements:\u00bf       Underlying services that enable dynamic peer-to-peer distributed information dissemination, to include registration of nodes in the tactical information network, access to internodal communication, and distributed data access, messaging and eventservices.\u00bf        Supporting infrastructure for the agents at each node that will enable the intelligent prioritization and management of information dissemination, to include local agent registration, interaction, and control services.  The infrastructure willnew combat elements joining the network, registering with peer nodes, and participating in the interchange of information.  The platform layer has been designed to implement the features of the ATL Grapevine Architecture's peer-to-peer disseminationconcepts with the particular goal of supporting Distributed Data Fusion.DAIDS will provide the following military benefits:\u00bf        Improved dissemination of salient information to other members of the combat team.\u00bf     Bandwidth-aware information dissemination policies.\u00bf    Enhanced survivability through timely dissemination of threat information.The full fruition of the DAIDS concept will provide the following benefits to Army aviation:. Enhanced awareness through an improved local tactical picture supported by intelligent dissemination of relevant information.. Better mission effectiveness through adaptability of priorities and greater flexibility for re-configuration of tasks and team. Survivability enhanced by better threat awareness and dissemination of priority information to masked shooters.For Army combat environments like HSKT and FCS, the primary benefits of this research will derive from two aspects of our system concept: localization of fusion activities at individual distributed nodes of the network of combat elements, and selective,intelligent peer-to-peer dissemination of information across network nodes.Local fusion of information will provide each node of the network with a context-tuned, view of the Common Tactical Picture that is more specifically pertinent to the mission of the individual platform than the simple sum of all teammate data available tothat platform.Intelligent dissemination of information between platforms will ensure that the Common Tactical Picture that results from fusion is as complete, accurate and relevant to the individual as the constraints on bandwidth and processing resources will allow.The goal of intelligent information dissemination is to get the right information to the right place at the right time.  To accomplish this, in the real world, limitations on communications bandwidth and processing power must be faced.  The ability toemploy intelligent prioritization schemes to communicate only situation-relevant information between nodes, means that scarce communications and processing resources will be used more effectively to deliver the right information to the right place at theright time.  This means better decisions by each combat element, better coordination of activities in combat situations, and better survivability and mission effectiveness for every team member.In order to be able to make dissemination decisions based on the needs of individual recipients, it is important to have current information on the information needs and capabilities of the other members of the team.  DAIDS will permit combat teams tooperate dynamically, adding and relinquishing team members as needed.  Because dynamic team member sensing capabilities registration is not being funded as a part of the AMUST-D program, DAIDS will fill a critical technology enabling and risk reductionrole for Distributed Data Fusion as a part of that program. Subsequently, DAIDS will support proliferation of AMUST-D's Distributed Data Fusion work for future Army and Joint operations.Intelligent information dissemination also applies outside the Army air combat regime.

The polyimide substrate has limited high temperature capability, and consequentlyrestricts CIGS PV material quality, while the stainless steel foils are a source of impurities, have rough surfaces, and do not enable space saving monolithic integration. ITN has teamed with Dow Chemical Corp. to develop insulating substrates based onSi-resin compounds.  These substrates can achieve processing temperatures above 500\u00bfC while providing an electrically insulated substrate to facilitate monolithic integration. ITN is developing two potential substrate schemes: Si-resin based insulators onmetal foil, and free-standing Si-resin based insulator films. The best performing substrates will be utilized in Phase 2 to demonstrate monolithically-integrated PV modules and scale-up.",

The long-term objective of this project is to commercialize a topical formulation containing retinoic acid (ATRA) for subjects with dysplastic nevi at a higher risk of developing malignant melanoma. However, ATRA is highly irritating to the skin. Several topical delivery systems have been shown to reduce ATRA-induced skin irritation. Phase I studies have shown that the biopolymer chitosan acts as a topical delivery system for ATRA. In this Phase II SBIR study we propose to: (1) standardize the topical formulation containing the ATRA/chitosan delivery system according to our IND 60,073, (2) test the long-term toxicity and irritation of the formulation in both rodents and non-rodents species according to FDA 21 CFR, Part 58, (3) determine whether 6 months of topical ATRA/chitosan will result in a significant clinical improvement of dysplastic nevi, and/or a decrease in the dysplasia grade, and/or a change in the expression of proliferation biomarkers, by performing a multicenter controlled clinical trial involving 16 dysplastic nevi subjects using Internet-based randomization, electronic data capture, coordination and monitoring, and pre and post study clinical and histological assessment.",

Three primary components of KCI's system, the joiner panel, curtain plate and coaming, will be made from pultruded phenolic composites. Advantages of pultrusion include lower fabrication cost and the ability to make panels in arbitrarily longlengths. This creates a new installation cost and weight paradigm by reducing the number of joints. Cost-saving technology for attaching the coaming to the deck will be investigated. Photogrammetry and CAD-modeling will be demonstrated as labor-savingalternatives to eyeballed cut-and-fit technology for patching curtain plates around overhead obstructions. A key component of the Phase II work will be continued development of a new core material that demonstrated an interesting combination of cost,weight and fire performance in Phase I testing. Phase II will terminate with a prototype demonstration, including a pultruded joiner panel, coaming, and curtain plate, plus evaluation of new core and installation concepts. In the Option Phase KCI willdeliver a quantity of pultruded joiner panel system components to the Navy for sea trials. Successful completion of the proposed work will result in a lightweight, low cost joiner panel system with a widespread market in both the commercial and militaryshipbuilding industry.

KCI will work to adapt and apply the Phase II system to both newinstallations aboard CG-47, LPD-17, DDG-51, CVN-X and other platforms, as well for service life extension programs in the military and commercial world. More importantly for KCI and the Navy, use of large pultruded joiner panels on Naval vessels is a lowrisk application that provides an opportunity to demonstrate the significant cost saving potential of pultruding very large ship structure, compared to making similar structure by VARTM technology, without requiring the Navy to commit to installation ofexperimental composite parts in some difficult to replace, mission-critical location of ship's structure. Success with the joiner panel product could represent the first step in the path to acceptance of a new material and process technology combinationthat will have a broad reaching effect on the future use of composites in shipbuilding.",

        "abstract": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: As crop growers begin to use GPS technology to manage the variability in their fields, they are seeking ways to assess the variability of physical and chemical properties more accurately and cost-effectively. In the most common approach, soil samples are acquired on a 2.5 acre grid pattern. Soil properties often have greater spatial variability than is identified with this approach, however the costs of sampling and lab analysis preclude denser sampling. A promising approach to this problem is to use ion-selective electrodes that measure soil properties on-the-go much more intensively than 2.5 acres/sample. A soil-sampling mechanism was prototyped by Purdue University for sensing soil pH. This device was re-designed and extensively field-tested with pH electrodes during a Phase I project. On-the-go pH sensing has proven feasible and is viable for commercial development. Validation of pH sensor data during earlier research confirmed the economic advantages of dense, on-the-go mapping versus current sampling methods. In the new project, several user-oriented features will be integrated for commercial use, and advancements will be made in using other ion-selective electrodes, and in prescribing applications from sensor data.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will provide both a valuable new assessment instrument and an online professional development system for those who serve families with children in their formative years. Even though, quality parenting/caregiving is recognized as key to a child's healthy development, no assessment instrument is routinely used. With an instrument to assess caregiving behaviors, providers can make informed interventions and monitor improvement. To make the instrument widely available we will develop an online learning system that trains providers to competently use the instrument. We will leverage this technology and access to providers to develop a range of online professional development programs that are convenient and low cost. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) Develop and validate a practical caregiver-child interaction assessment tool; 2) Develop and test an online training program for the assessment tool; and 3) Deploy the technology platform to deliver other high value trainings to child/family service programs. An existing research scale will be adapted for clinical use, and inter-rater reliability, internal consistency and validity tested. A longitudinal study assessing parenting outcomes with the clinically relevant tool will be conducted. Two methods of scoring the tool and the accuracy of paraprofessionals and professionals in the field will be tested. To make the tool clinically useful and readily accessible, the training for the tool will be made available online. The interactive training system will contain a searchable video library of caregiver examples with commentary from an expert. Furthermore, the impact of training and using the tool on provider practice will be studied. Many in the field are eager to have the interaction assessment instrument and online training. Using the online learning technology developed in this project, existing didactic trainings currently offered within partnering organizations will be converted to online learning and tested for their efficacy and learner satisfaction. When complete, providers who serve families with children in their formative years will be empowered with a new tool to support effective parenting/caregiving and have a rich online resource to support their continuing professional development.",

The technology base is the novel holographic liquid crystal.  The modulators in series with laser beams will replace the current Resistive Emitter Array to provide a much wider scenarios simulation dynamics from low background IR scenes to veryhigh radiance scenes at 3,000K in Wideband Infrared Scene Projector.  With the enhanced performance featuring 12-bit modulation dynamic range, wide spectrum range from the visible to middle infrared, and low cost, the modulators minimize the cost andcomplexity of MDA Infrared guided interceptor systems.  Other applications include optical modulators for LADAR beam scanning, 2D tunable modulators for multi/hyperspectral image systems, and high-speed multispectral modulators for optical correlators.This Phase II program is designed to develop two groups of prototypes, i.e., single pixel modulators and pixilated modulators.  Liquid crystal material and fabrication procedures will be optimized for wide operation spectrum, high contrast ratio, low loss,low driving voltage, and fast speed.

        "abstract": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: Striped bass culture has become the fourth largest form of fish production in the U.S., trailing only catfish, trout, and salmon in terms of market value. Unfortunately, this promising new industry faces considerable market pressure from foreign competitors who often enjoy lower labor, water, and utility costs and fewer environmental regulations than encountered in the U.S. To compete effectively, U.S. producers must develop new technologies to lower production costs and assist them in dealing with inexpensive foreign imports. One promising concept involves the use of modern sex-reversal techniques to produce monosex populations. It has been shown that monosex populations of several cultured species, including trout and tilapia, grow more rapidly and efficiently compared to mixed sex populations. Kent SeaTech has discovered that female hybrid striped bass may grow up to 36% larger than their male siblings. If advanced culture technologies can be developed to take advantage of this growth difference under commercial production conditions, the U.S. hybrid striped bass culture industry would have a strong advantage over foreign producers. The purpose of this research is to develop methods of producing all-female populations of hybrid striped bass and to determine whether this concept would result in significant cost benefits to U.S. producers.",

The Pocket Team MultiMedia Warfighter (PTMW) is an innovative hand-held PDA application that supports liveteam collaboration in the battlefield. Each soldier can see the battle map as the mission evolves. The background of the map shows the terrain, while animated sprites display the location and motion of friendly and enemy forces. Additional overlay sheetscontain sprites with information about visibility, threat, mobility, and other situational awareness markers. A unique patent-pending architecture allows each PTMW station to feel like a full powered workstation. There is an intelligent partitioning of thework between the PTMW and the server engines. PTMW stations are responsible for the movement of graphic sprites, while the back-end servers do expensive simulation and map computations on an extensible server farm. Soldiers can easily interact with eachother in real-time to provide intelligence and planning data to synchronize military actions. Cutting edge compression and a unique data communication layer allow the PTMW to work in low bandwidth environments and deal robustly with communicationbreakdowns. The Pocket Team MultiMedia Warfighter (PTMW) is a tool that is aimed at making a quantum improvement in the training of war fighters by teaching them how to coordinate and orchestrate actions in live battlefield conditions. It readily lendsitself to applications for reconnaissance, scouting, as well as combined force operations involving armor, ground, and close air support. Because PTMW is a very flexible system it can be readily adapted to assist in other map-based coordination tasks.These applications include: civil defense, forest fire management, emergency response to terrorist attacks, and civil disaster coordination between police, fire, and emergency response teams. Commercial uses include multiplayer gaming, remote medicalcollaboration, and teaching teamwork skills in schools by PTMW supported outdoor collaborative games.",

Large-scale, time-dependent 3D simulations of complex configurations using CFD have become increasingly critical in the design of aircraft, rotorcraft, aerospace vehicles andpropulsion systems. As the pace of simulation increases, the sheer volume of numerical data makes it increasingly critical that a stable and easy to operate post-processing/visualization methodology be developed. Technology innovations in this proposedwork will focus on robust streakline integration, visualization techniques optimized for rotorcraft grids and transient data, improved data access on remote computers and development of an Intelligent Graphical Object (IGO) database for the highlyinteractive 3D display of transient data including streaklines, streamlines, iso-surfaces, cutting planes, boundary surfaces and vortex cores. These visualization techniques, if fully developed, can have a significant impact on government and industry'sability to post-process large-scale time-dependent CFD simulation data. Large-scale, time-dependent 3D simulations of complex configurations using CFD have becoming increasingly critical in the design of aircraft, rotorcraft, aerospace vehicles andpropulsion systems. Army programs such as RAH-66 Comanche will benefit from this simulation technology. CFD users in the commercial sector (for example - Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Ford Motor Company, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, Sikorsky, Pratt & Whitney),the Federal Government (Air Force, Navy, Army and NASA) and the National Laboratories are using this technology. These large organizations that make extensive use of CFD analysis have indicated that large-scale unsteady 3D CFD simulations are almostimpossible to post-process without huge investments in computer hardware and staffer's time. As the current state-of-the-art in post-processing large-scale time-dependent CFD data does not provide satisfactory performance for these problems, investment inthe next generation of such tools is required. The offeror perceives a need in the marketplace to address these issues in a commercial product offering that provides great benefits in usability, performance and data access. The proposed project will enablethe offeror to be responsive to the needs of the CFD community.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prior to surgery the donor cornea is screened for a number of pathologies and its history is examined for contra-indicated events, including the application of refractive surgery.  Current techniques, such as topological measurement, produce significant errors, resulting in rejection of viable corneas and worse, potential use of modified corneas. With over a million corneal refractive procedures yearly, the potential of LASIK-modified corneas entering into the tissue bank system has increased significantly. The objective of this Phase II project is to further refine for commercialization the prototype device that was demonstrated in Phase I.  Phase I data demonstrated a very high sensitivity and specificity for differentiating \"normal\", surgically unmodified, from LASIK-modified donor corneas. The Donor Cornea Characterization System (DCCS) has been shown to detect donor corneas which have been modified by refractive surgery, such as laser-assisted in-situ keratomleusis (LASIK). The DCCS employs a novel wavefront measurement system to optically characterize the corneas. This technology was integrated in Phase I into a laboratory device. The presence of scattering sources in the cornea produces scintillations that inhibit other wavefront sensors. Our device, which does not use traditional Shack-Hartmann technology, however, has the ability to make accurate wavefront measurements in the presence of scintillation. The 50 corneas, 20 of which had been LASIK modified, produced wavefront data that show clearly discernible differences in the nature of the wavefront distortions of unmodified (normal) corneas and those modified by LASIK.  Phase II will produce a low-cost, table-top device for use in an eye bank environment. Our goal is to implement the device in the New Mexico Eye Bank for \"real time\" testing of donor corneas by the start of year 2. This \"beta-testing\" will collect data for several hundred corneas in addition to the continued data collection with the Phase I prototype device.

The proposed engine, theMeyer Nutating engine, can burn heavy diesel fuel, with a disk nutating around a rotating shaft. This novel arrangement permits the displaced volume of the engine to be used twice per engine revolution, corresponding to what in piston engines would beconsidered one power stroke per engine revolution. This feature enables the engine to produce the power/volume and power/weight in small power ranges as required in this solicitation, while the external combustion chamber permits burning diesel fuel as insmall gas turbines. The potential of the new technology is high, the risk is manageable, and the probability of success is high. The engine can exceed the power/weight and power/volume constraints of the proposal in engines under 10 kW power while burningdiesel fuel.   KRD has formed a joint venture with Baker Engineering Inc. to continue the design/analysis effort incorporating two discs into the engine design, create detailed drawings, develop a prototype engine and perform initial testing during thePhase II program.This engine has very high potential for commercial applications ranging from engines for aircraft to power generation to land vehicles. Its power density is of great interest in aircraft applications. Also, higher thermal efficiency andlower manufacturing costs would ensure market success in all commercial markets.",

HPC simulations are widely used in the design of new materials and weaponssystems. However, the amount of data they generate is large, limiting the analysis of the HPC results to a few high-powered computers. In this proposal we introduce the notion of a visualization server, much like a traditional web server, that wouldsupport the analysis and exploration of HPC simulations from a wide range of clients. The visualization server and clients would be built upon the Visualization ToolKit (VTK), a widely used, comprehensive, portable, open-source visualization library. Thesystem uses secure methods of data transmission requiring only basic functionality from a standard Web browser. Because the system takes advantage of VTK's parallel streaming pipeline, large amounts of data (a petabyte has been documented) can be processedand rendered in parallel. The system will be developed by Kitware, Inc., a small business providing commercial support for VTK, and whose employees are the original creators and maintainers of VTK.The proposed project will significantly improve the use andaccessibility of HPC clusters in many military and commercial fields. HPC is already used for ballistics, ablation, impact analysis, weather prediction, new weapon systems, communications coverage, tracking systems, logistics, nuclear testing,environmental analysis, and computational fluid dynamics. The web-based client application will provide an easy to use interface to a powerful visualization server. This allows analysts with the proper authentication to quickly and easily access HPCresults from their desktop or palmtop computer. The visualization server will make using HPC resources less labor intensive and more powerful by providing a flexible scalable tool that can process data sets of virtually any size on any clusterarchitecture.    The proposed tools will be invaluable post-processing and run-time resources for analyzing and debugging large simulations.  Specific benefits will include faster analysis cycles with less wasted runs, and easier generation of animationsfor communicating simulation results.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovative Research Phase II project will create general-purpose software tools for visualizing the results of advanced numerical simulation. Simulation techniques, which make up a large part of the multi-billion dollar CAD/CAM/CAE market, are widely used to design and build the majority of products manufactured today. Visualization plays an important role in this process by transforming simulation results into images which designers, engineers, and scientists can use to understand and communicate about their products. Recent advances in numerical simulation provide an opportunity for methods based on higher-order basis functions.  These functions better model curved geometry and are more accurate than conventional techniques employing linear approximation functions. The use of this technology is limited by a lack of general-purpose visualization software tools for higher-order methods. Providing these tools will accelerate the adoption of this technology into the marketplace resulting in software that will produce superior product designs, in shorter time, and at lower cost. An adaptive tessellation process that converts higher-order basis into linear graphics primitives and preserves the visual accuracy of the solution, while maintaining interactive graphics performance, is proposed.\n\nThis technology will be licensed and add-on adaptors will be offered that will enable vendors to easily and efficiently interface their systems to this technology.",

A powerful new technology promises to significantly improve the way in which these leadershipskills are acquired and put into practice. The novel technology acts as a facilitator, knowledge resource, and evaluator in online discussion groups, in which war-fighters share knowledge and experience in realistic problem-centered discussions. Thetechnology embeds an intelligent text-understanding software agent based on Latent Semantic Analysis.A prototype demonstrating feasibility was field-tested at the Army War College.  It was well-received, and produced benefits in quantity and quality of knowledge.  In Phase II we will implement and evaluate a fully functional version.  In it thetext-understanding software agent will do real-time, discussion mentoring and behind-the-scenes monitoring of the discussion.  It will supplement the environment with several hundred digital books on terrorism.  Users will be able to instantly find allrelated paragraphs in the entire library.  The underlying software agent will enhance discussions by connecting relevant comments to each other and to information in the electronic library. The agent will also continually assess contributions of individualparticipants and the group as a whole.When perfected and operational, the greatly enhanced distributed cooperative learning environment will increase opportunities for practicing strategic leadership skills on relevant critical incidents.  The envisioned tools provide instant access tocritical content information and situational updates on which to base planning and decision.  They will also expand participation in information gathering, planning, and decision making activities for any legitimate team member with internet access, nomatter when or where located, making it possible to form ad-hoc discussion groups on a need-to-participate basis.  In addition to supporting synchronous or asynchronous team problem solving discussions, such a system would be a powerful teaching andevaluation tool in a distance learning environment. While the initial environment targets relatively high level officers, such an environment is as much or more useful for lower ranking officers.In the private sector, such a capability could be used to support strategic thinking skills in diverse fields, such as law, medicine, civil defense, crises management, and business.  All such fields have critical incidents and conflicts which tax relevantexperience and leadership skills.  In educational applications it would offer opportunities for the enormous amounts of practice needed to acquire leadership skills in any domain.  The benefits of a largely automatically developed and delivered computerbased system would be synergistic with those of ADL and distance learning efforts enabled by the Internet.",

In Phase I research, we successfully developed a biological process for production of 15-R-6-deoxyerythronolide B, the biochemical precursor of 15-R-erythromycins (R=various chemical groups), that involves expression of the 6-deoxyerythronolide B (DEBS) polyketide synthase (PKS) genes in an Escherichia coli strain carrying the requisite PKS substrate supply genes. In Phase II this process will be optimized for large-scale production of the desired 15-R-6-deoxyerythronolide B (15-R-6dEB) by feeding the 5R-3-hydroxy-2-methylpentanoic acid N-acetylcysteamine thioester (\"diketide-SNAC\") to an E. coli strain expressing the engineered DEBS1 module 2/DEBS2/DEBS3 genes. The resulting 15-R-6dEB will be used subsequently to produce a lead ketolide Kosan has discovered in partnership with another company. The specific aims for the Phase II research are: 1) to determine the relationship between the titer of polyketide produced and the level of DEBS PKS, substrate supply enzymes and substrates. These data will help us design and construct a recombinant E. coli strain that produces >100 mg/L of 15-R-6dEB in a diketide-fed, shake flask fermentation. 2) To isolate, by random mutagenesis of an E. coli strain bearing DEBS PKS and substrate supply genes, mutant strains with a >10-fold increase in 15-R-6dEB titer in a diketide-fed, shake flask fermentation. The improved genetic background of these mutants is expected to enhance the performance of the optimum arrangement of the DEBS PKS and substrate supply genes created in Specific Aim 1. 3) To introduce the optimal metabolically engineered DEBS PKS and substrate supply genes from Specific Aim 1 into the E. coli strain from Specific Aim 2 to create an E. coli recombinant strain that produces >250 mg/L of 15-R-6dEB in a diketide-fed, shake flask fermentation. 4) To optimize the physiological and process parameters for maximum production of 15-R-6dEB at >1 g/L by high cell density E. coli cultures in a 2 liter stirred fermentor. This will be done with a strain obtained through achievement of Specific Aim 3.  Several of the ketolide series of analogs based on 15-R-erythromycin A have excellent in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity, comparable to or better than the leading ketolides in current clinical trials or approved by the FDA for specific uses.

Conventional strain improvement processes are necessary to make therapeutically important polyketides commercially attractive but are time consuming and tedious. The long term goals of this work are to develop generic approaches to polyketide overproduction and then apply these approaches to the generation of novel polyketide antimicrobials. In this proposal, we are targeting the production of novel erythromycin analogs for lead generation and preclinical development of ketolide and motilide therapeutics. Ketolides are a new class of potent antibiotics with activity against erythromycin sensitive organisms. Motilides are motilin receptor agonists being developed for treatment of gastric pariesis, gastric reflux disease and other uses. The specific aims of this proposal are: i.) to use an erythromycin overproducing system developed in Phase I to express several genetically modified erythromycin PKS genes and produce fully mature erythromycin analogs needed for early and late stage testing, and ii.) to adapt the system to one that will efficiently incorporate synthetic diketide-SNAC precursors into the polyketide product and produce erythromycin analogs by precursor-directed biosynthesis. As specific aim iii), we plan to initiate development of a second generation generic overproduction host in the widely used actinomycete host Streptomyces coelicolor. These aims will facilitate the advancement of ketolide and motilide compounds that are in late stage preclinical development, potentially generate new leads for development, and expand the diversity of structures that can be achieved through the genetic manipulation of polyketide synthases in microbiological systems. Furthermore, the establishment of well-defined overproduction hosts will facilitate analyzing the molecular and physiological basis of overproduction.",

Gasoline containing MTBE has leaked into groundwater, presenting both health risks and objectionable odor and taste in lakes, aquifers, and urban wells in 49 states.  Due to the specific physical and chemical properties of MTBE, conventional technologies cannot remediate MTBE-contaminated groundwater satisfactorily.  \n\nIn the Phase I research project, KSE, Inc., established the technical feasibility of a novel technology to remediate MTBE-contaminated groundwater and soils.  One major innovation provides a novel technology to completely destroy MTBE and BTEX in air from groundwater strippers or soil vapor extraction.  Extremely low temperature catalytic oxidation has been achieved with a new class of catalysts designed specifically for these compounds.  Operating temperatures of 30\u00bf80\u00bfC were achieved.  The new catalyst activity is orders of magnitude greater than that of the traditional platinum alumina catalyst.  The low temperature operation allows use of advanced design materials to further lower pollution control costs to 5\u00bf15 percent of those of conventional methods.  With the commercialization of this new class of catalysts, an inexpensive, compact, and effective technique will be available for cleaning up groundwater and soils contaminated by fuel oxygenates, avoiding the cost and size of traditional high temperature catalytic oxidizers, with their attendant heat exchangers and piping systems.\n\nThis new class of catalysts will be commercialized in the Phase II research project.

Large-scale prototype operation will be undertaken to demonstrate both the catalyst performance and such materials of construction as fiberglass-reinforced plastic, made possible by the low temperature catalyst operation.  A competitive cost analysis of the technology relative to other alternatives will be performed for MTBE remediation.  It is anticipated that a cost-effective technology will be developed for remediation of MTBE-contaminated groundwater that is capable of rapid deployment. \n\nThe commercial applications for the concept will be for efficient remediation of groundwater and sites contaminated by MTBE, without the associated air emissions or large, costly equipment installations in urban sites.  It should be of value to both the private and government sectors, reduce the cost of remediating groundwater contaminated by MTBE, help protect the Nation\u00bfs drinking water supply, and improve economic competitiveness.",

Potential commercial applications include enzyme activity measurements on sub-microliter liquid samples, such as blood drawn from experimental animals (or humans), tissue extract specimens, purified enzymes, and drug discovery research and development.",

The detection system is based on optical fiber Bragg grating sensors for dynamic strain and acoustic emissions. In Phase II of this project a 8-channel wavelength division multiplexed 8 sensors will be developed, which comprise a sensornetwork covering a wide spatial area and providing directional information. The sensitivity will be high enough so that the sensors will be able to monitor seismic activities induced by troop and/or vehicle movement in the vicinity of the sensors.Thesensors developed under this program will be ideal for troop/vehicle movement monitoring and information gathering in the battle field. These can all be accomplished remotely and autonomously with the fiber optic sensors proposed here. Commercialapplications are equally promising, since the sensors can be used for highway and bridge monitoring, down-hole sensing and monitoring for oil/gas explorations.",

West Nile virus was isolated for the first time in North America in 1999.  In less than three years, the geographical distribution of the virus expanded dramatically in the United States.  A vaccine will be an important complement to other public health measures as this emerging pathogen becomes endemic in this continent.  Phase I research studied immunogens based on the envelope protein of a U.S. West Nile virus isolate.  We prepared recombinant protein and synthetic peptide antigens, and initiated immunization studies.  Mice were vaccinated with the recombinant antigens, antibody responses were evaluated, and protective immunity was characterized.  Phase II experiments will vaccinate horses with a promising candidate vaccine, and demonstrate that vaccination elicits protective antibodies.  Experiments are designed to elicit high titer antibodies using our recombinant envelope protein antigen with aluminum hydroxide adjuvant.  Subsequent experiments will determine if antibodies induced in horses can: (1) neutralize West Nile virus in vitro; (2) protect passively immunized mice from West Nile virus.  This project will provide veterinarians, clinicians and public health officials with new means to manage West Nile virus outbreaks.",

        "abstract": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: Conditions on U.S. rangelands have long been a source of concern to natural resource experts and land stewards. Within the past two decades environmental and social concerns have resulted in statutes and regulations prompting for improved land, water, and ecological monitoring and management practices. These mandates imply a need for significant amounts of information for managing, planning, and inventorying rangelands. The National Academy of Science published the NRC 1994 Report, Rangeland Health, as an alternative to Range Condition methodology. This report concluded that current rangeland inventories do not provide the data needed to support national assessments of rangeland health. The NRC Committee stressed that standardization of monitoring systems must occur and recommended that rangeland health be assessed based on the status of multiple environmental indicators representing the four basic ecological processes. The report did not produce a method and expressed a need for improved evaluations regarding ecological health of the nation's rangelands. The science of assessing rangelands is changing as concepts evolve, yet existing systems appear to be disincentives for land managers to incorporate. Rangeland monitoring is a tool to optimize economic benefits, improve and sustain ecological functions, and comply with legal mandates. The CRIS3 will reduce confusion by clearly translating ecological concepts involving complex processes and components, into standardized terms that the public can comprehend, and resource specialists can use to determine rangeland health.",

The mid-infrared spectral region offers enhanced atmospheric transmission, including penetration through dust and smoke, combined with the capability of detecting chemical agents and biological aerosols.Additionally, man-made materials and volatile organics can be detected in a cluttered background by means of differential imaging in the mid-infrared.  However, the tactical advantages of this spectral region have not been fully exploited.  The majorshortcomings of the existing systems are excessive weight and size; low poor efficiency, limited frequency agility, and lack of compactness and ruggedness.  This program will assemble a 100-Hz intra-cavity OPO mid-infrared lidar system, which is compact,rugged and power efficient enough to operate from a UAV.

Driven by higher productivity, throughput and quality goals, the machining industry has an increasing need for improved characterization of machinetools and for controlling vibration and chatter during the machining process. There is a growing demand for high-speed milling as well as an increasing use of small size tools and of difficult to machined advanced materials. To reach these goals, advancedmachine system must rely on accurate sensors to measure and to control vibrations. The sensor should: (1)  accurately measure vibrations, (2) be insensitive to the machining environment, (3) be used both for characterization prior operation and formonitoring during the milling process, and (4) be compact and low cost.

Based on turbopump technology, these new devices offer smaller size, greater efficiency (hence smaller batteries), high reliability, and are more cost effective as compared to their pulsatile predecessors. For all the virtues of these new turbopumps, they bring additional challenges.

Language delays are pervasive among school-age children. Early intervention is crucial since the consequences of language delay can be serious and cumulative. Yet research shows that most children with language delays never receive language intervention services during their preschool years. We propose to complete an Internet-based early language intervention system designed specifically for the remediation of language disorders in 3-5 year old children with language function in the range of 24-42 months. The curricular design will be guided by contemporary linguistic research. Online delivery of the intervention curriculum will be individualized and controlled by an artificial intelligence system that tracks performance and adjusts instructional support. By combining easy access via the Internet with centralized data collection and curricular control, it will become possible to implement and easily manage coordinated school and home language intervention strategies, and to provide services to more children without further taxing limited professional resources. In Phase I we tested the feasibility and technical merit of this objective. A prototype program module was developed and tested with 23 students who were enrolled in an Early Essential Education program, including 19 preschoolers with language delays. Data were collected over the Internet while testing six of these children. In Phase II we plan to fully develop and field-test this Internet-based language intervention system.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to use animal models to test the efficacy of biglycan as a protein therapeutic for muscular dystrophy. Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a heritable disease that affects approximately 1 in 3,500 boys. These children are usually wheelchair-bound by age 12 and rarely survive past their early twenties. There are currently no effective treatments for the underlying pathology of DM0. The molecular pathogenesis of Duchenne's and many other muscular dystrophies has been traced to a specialized ensemble of proteins at the muscle cell surface known as the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC). Mutation of dystrophin leads to disruption in the organization of the DAPC. The resulting failure of DAPC function results in muscle cell damage and loss. We have recently discovered that the extracellular matrix molecule biglycan is expressed at the muscle cell surface and binds, by distinct mechanisms, to the ectodomains of three core constituents of the DAPC: alpha-dystroglycan, aipha-sarcoglycan and gamma-sarcoglycan. These molecular interactions indicate that biglycan can bridge the component subcomplexes of the DAPC and thus coordinate and stabilize the entire complex from outside the cell. Indeed, biglycan null (bgn-/o) mice display a dystrophic phenotype as evidenced by weakened muscle cell membranes and cell death. These observations suggest that biglycan could serve as a therapeutic to stabilize the DAPC from its extracellular aspect when dystrophin is absent. Biglycan thus represents a new path for developing therapies for muscular dystrophies. Importantly, since the biglycan-DAPC interactions are wholly extracellular, biglycan can be introduced to the muscle by systemic delivery of the purified recombinant protein. This program will utilize unique production methods to produce sufficient quantities of high quality biglycan, .and test efficacy in several animal models of muscular dystrophy.",

The advent of handheld computerized devices has ushered in a resurgence of interest in behavioral approaches that can better serve the huge market of smokers who want to quit by using self-managed approaches. Great advances have been facilitated by electronic means of monitoring usage, tailoring treatments, delivering complex regimens, and giving instantaneous feedback. Scheduled smoking reduction has proven highly efficacious when executed with technological devices. Pioneering studies, however, employed a three-stage step-down regimen of 21 days, following a baseline data collection week.  This one-size-fits-all, arbitrary protocol was an excellent start, but the protocol potentially has twice the effectiveness when it is customized to individual nuances, as we demonstrated in Phase I. This study will test a technique for adjusting treatment durations using current state technology. The strategy compares users' compliance with recent protocols and prescribes frequent course corrections that are designed to keep the user engaged in the process. Uniquely designed to perform reduction algorithms, our computerized interactive communicator will be the delivery system for this regimen. The device significantly raises the standards for precise usage data collection and regimen tailoring.",

        "abstract": "The design of a laser system with simultaneous requirements of multiple output wavelengths, long pulse duration, and high output energy, is at best challenging.  This challenge has been met during Phase I of this program.  The focus of Phase II is onmaking the system more compact, and on increasing the output energy.Multi-wavelength lasing, although not always efficient with some laser systems because of phase-matching requirements that depend on the emitted wavelength, is generally accomplished by second and/or third harmonic generation of the fundamental emission.For wavelengths that are longer than the fundamental, Raman conversion or Optical Parametric Oscillation is the process that is usually chosen.  Both of these optical processes are non-linear in nature, and therefore require high peak powers.  These powerlevels are typically achieved with a short pulse laser system using either Q-switching, and/or mode-locking.  Achieving high output energies, with long pulses that can vary from hundreds of nanoseconds to several milliseconds, is however a more difficulttask.  At the completion of Phase I, we have demonstrated just that, leveraging on various proprietary technologies developed by Light Age, Inc.Light Age uses alexandrite crystals as the laser gain medium.  These lasers are all solid state, quasi-four level vibronic sources, and therefore tunable.  Light Age leverages the unique optical properties of alexandrite and its proprietary pulsestretching technology to produce laser output with pulse durations of 500 to 5000 ns.  In order to reach peak powers needed for nonlinear conversion, the laser output is amplified in a chain of alexandrite amplifier stages.  The combination ofalexandrite's high damage threshold and excellent capacity to store energy (far exceeding other solid state materials) makes alexandrite very well suited for producing extremely high output energies.  After the amplification of the pulse-stretchedalexandrite laser, a high peak power beam is generated that is suitable for nonlinear frequency conversion.  The alexandrite laser combined with Light Age's high efficiency Raman conversion techniques allows for tunable laser radiation throughout thevisible and near IR.  Multispectral output is achieved using the combination of these technologies with harmonic generation. The development of a multispectral line long pulse laser source greatly enhances Light Age's laser technology and allows us to increase our position in a few markets and enter into many new markets. Many of these applications will benefit from one or moreof the otherwise hard to achieve laser specifications.  The markets we expect to address with this technology are: 1) The production of holograms using a three color coherent output of the laser source.  Holograms created using pulse laser sources reducemuch of the complexity of stabilizing the object since the hologram can be produced with a single laser pulse in the hundreds of nanosecond durations. 2) Medical diagnostic is utilizing lasers in order to detect early stage cancers and other abnormalitiesthroughout the body.  These lasers can be used to excite fluorescent contrast agents or be used in photoacoustic imaging.  The wavelength range in the fundamental of alexandrite's tuning curve is ideal for deep penetration into tissue making it an idealsource for medical diagnostics. 3) Selective laser trabeculloplasty for the treatment of glucoma. Laser pulses of  1-10 ms  may have an advantage in preserving the integrity of the trabecular meshwork.Due to the versatility of the pulse stretched, high energy alexandrite laser, we expect that many applications will be developed or enhanced by this laser source.  These developments will allow some of early stage research applications to mature intolarger commercial markets.",

The weakest link in most accelerator systems is the low energy end, where the disruptive effects of acceleration are the greatest and the focusing forces are weakest.

        "abstract": "Over the past decade, the military has invested significantly in the development of laser radar (ladar) technology for application in remote reconnaissance and autonomous seekers. The majority of contemporary ladar systems utilize high pulse repetitionfrequency (PRF), compact, diode end-pumped, solid-state lasers as transmitter sources. Examples of systems currently under development that use this type of laser are LOCASS, DAZZLE, and CMRTR, among others. In order for these systems to reach their fullmilitary utility, they must be very compact, lightweight, rugged, efficient, low cost, and easily mass-produced. One key factor in achieving this level of maturity is the integration of advanced conduction-cooling subsystems to the laser. The workperformed under this program addresses the shortcomings of current laser and laser cooling technology, and provides an innovative approach to meeting the goals of contemporary advanced ladar seeker programs.  The product of our Phase-II development will bea fully qualified and packaged ladar transmitter that utilizes advanced active and passive cooling to fulfill the mission requirements of both continuous and intermittent operation, respectively. The laser system under this program will be tested againstthe shock, vibration, and temperature environment of a contemporary missile platform.  The laser system technology and demonstration will have direct application in present and planned ladar seeker programs. The laser performance and reliability againstharsh environmental conditions is considered to be among the highest risk items of the ladar seeker system. Therefore, successful environmental testing of the laser transmitter will help reduce the risk for on-going and future advanced ladar seekerprograms.  Three-dimensional laser radar is widely accepted as a preferred alternative to stereography as a means of producing digital elevation maps of the Earth's surface. Imaging laser altimeter (ILA) systems utilize the same technology as is employedin contemporary ladar seekers.

        "abstract": "LSA will design, build, and test an innovative, non-refractive, zoom lens prototype capable of precision metric monitoring of a missile during its entire flight trajectory at the White Sands Missile Range (WSMR). The ZoometricT Precision Lens developedduring this Phase II SBIR program will have automated zoom and aperture operation and be compatible with existing 35-mm camera film formats and high-speed digital image cameras.  Current testing practices use a variety of fixed focal length telescopes.Switching from one system to another during the flight test to maintain image size complicates mission and test planning and can cause the loss of critical data. The ZoometricT Precision Lens would decrease mission-planning time and produce cost savingsbenefits from reduced setup and calibration labor. Continuous smooth zoom operation will prevent loss of data or dropout of signals frequently encountered during the dynamic scale shifting operations associated with changing range. It will also permitscaling operations during and after the fact, which are directly relatable to the system chronology.  The ZoometricT  Precision Lens will specifically address the needs for missile testing at WSMR. In addition, this system will have application in otherDoD-oriented markets such as range and surveillance monitoring at other bases and test facilities. These facilities also measure the performance of their air, ground and sea platforms at increasingly long standoff ranges where utilization of the ZoometricTPrecision Lens would provide similar cost and timesavings.  The ZoometricT system and its subsystems can be applied to new applications in the government and commercial sectors.  Applications for the ZoometricT Precision Lens and its enabling technologiesinclude Free Space Optical (FSO) communications; long range surveillance for Homeland Defense; sea port surveillance; broadcast video photography for tracking in flight objects and sporting events, such as golf balls in flight; smooth, long-range,low-light-level zooming for television and motion picture industries; commercial astronomy; air traffic control, long-range visualization capability; autonomous geological surveying; and high performance multi-spectral imaging.",

        "abstract": "Proper training is essential for military forces around the world for teaching basic skills to new personnel and sustaining demanding skills that can degrade without practice.  One of the training techniques that are being heavily investigated is embeddedtraining.  In embedded training, computer-based simulation and control systems are installed within operational vehicles prior to a training session. In armored vehicles, such as the M1 tank or the AAAV, it is desirable for the computer-based simulation tobe located inside the periscope so that operators look at the same location for the real-world view and the simulated view. LSA proposes to develop a visual display system that can be permanently built into the periscopes on the AAAV to provide embeddedtraining capabilities over multiple periscopic view ports.  The system can be toggled to either present the real out the window (OTW) view or a simulated immersive computer-generated training image through the periscope. On this project, we willconcentrate on developing the hardware for distributing video to multiple periscopic view ports and the switchable video display technique within a periscope. As a culmination of the project, we plan on demonstrating the system by integrating thesubsystems into a self-contained feasibility demonstrator.  This proposal specifically aims to outfit the AAAV with ruggedized periscope displays as part of the embedded training system, but the technologies presented here can be applied to other vehiclesas well.  Military applications will include integration of high resolution displays into other armored vehicles and periscopes for embedded training and wartime use.  The techniques developed in this program can be modified for other situations where itwould be beneficial to have a simulated, remotely acquired or overlaid image.  The micro display is an alternative rugged information display that allows a virtual large screen and high resolution in a confined space while using little power.  Commercialapplications include head-mounted displays for video gaming, maintenance technicians, and other equipment for service and manufacturing users that need to be able to switch between fields of view.",

The typical neutralization eventis a low order deflagration of the energetic material accomplished by laser heating the casing.  The present laser technique will not neutralize buried land mines because the power is too low to move the soil over the mine.  In Phase I of this SBIR, it wasdemonstrated that higher power lasers (> 10 kW average power) could move the soil out of the way and heat the mine casing.  In Phase II, a prototype laser device with average power greater than 10 kW will be built in a configuration that will be readilyadaptable to installation in a mobile ground vehicle for the buried mine-neutralization mission.  This laser device will take advantage of innovative Nd:glass burst laser technology and advanced energy-storage components.  In essence, a small generatorwill continuously charge an energy storage device between neutralization sequences at which times the stored energy is converted to a powerful laser beam.  This beam will be capable of digging through soil of various types to neutralize the mine in lessthan 10 seconds.The burst laser system (BLS) will provide a greatly enhanced capability for military services to implement rapid and safe mine clearing operations.  The BLS will be cost-effective and will be made available for humanitarian mineneutralization as well.  In addition to these missions, the burst laser will find application in industrial materials processing such as intermittent deep-penetration welding.",

Line scanning offers resolution, contrast and field of view that are required for intrasurgical imaging. In the Phase I feasibility project, the laboratory prototype successfully demonstrated imaging of nuclear and cellular detail in human epidermis in vivo with 5-10 microns resolution. In Phase II, the goals are to quantitatively characterize optical performance within living human skin, package the prototype into a hand-held confocal scanner product, and test the scanner for imaging basal cell cancers on patients during Mohs surgery. Vis-a-vis the current method based on frozen pathology, real-time in situ confocal imaging may save both Mohs surgeon and patient several hours in the operating room. The hand-held line-scanning confocal microscope will have everything that surgeons and patients want: simple and robust design, inexpensive ($10K-20K), user-friendly package, controls and interface, and standard detection and display systems. The first application is for skin cancer but other tissues will be subsequently imaged as well. The intended users are surgeons, and the potential benefits to the patient are: painless, fast, less expensive and therefore significantly improved healthcare.",

Therefore, to reveal the full genetic diversity of microbial communities, this project will develop technology to clone the entire genome of a single microbial cell.  The approach will allow whole genome sequencing and expression screening of any cell, particularly those that exist in extreme environments.  The approach will be applied to reveal the genomic diversity of hyperthermal environments and to discover valuable heat-stable enzymes encoded by individual cells in these communities.  Genomic libraries and enzyme activities will be developed for academic and commercial use.  In Phase I, single microorganisms were isolated from a mixture of cells, using fluorescent microscopy and a micromanipulator.  The genome of a single cell was amplified and sheared to 1-2 kb fragments. It was then ligated to a transcription-free, zero-background cloning vector and transformed into a high efficiency E. coli strain.  A random shotgun library, adequate for 10X sequence coverage, was constructed from this cell's genome to demonstrate the feasibility of single-cell genomics.  In Phase II, genomic libraries of 70 novel hyperthermophilic microbes will be constructed.  All 70 libraries will be screened extensively by plate-based colony expression assays for enzymes with commercial and academic interest.   Enzymes with the greatest potential value will be developed and commercialized.     Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The technology should generate a single-cell DNA amplification kit, dual expression vector, and highly competent E. coli cells to be sold as reagent kits.  A single-cell genomic DNA cloning service would be offered.  Hyperthermophile genomic libraries could be sold as a series of discovery products.  Enzyme activity screens for numerous hyperthermophilic activities could provide environmentally friendly new reagents for numerous industries.  Potential applications also may exist in other fields, such as microbial pathology and environmental genomics, in which numerous microorganisms are known to exist but cannot be cultured.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Phase I of this proposal proved the feasibility of detection of the factor V Leiden mutation in human blood and correct determination of sample genotype as compared to a reference PCR method. The protocol used a new nucleic acid ligation-based technology, LMO amplification, invented at Lumigen. The LMO technology is based on the contiguous ligation of a set of short oligonucleotides to a template-bound primer under conditions in which the short oligonucleotides are not hybridized to the template. We demonstrated successful amplification, adequate sensitivity, and evaluated several different amplification designs. The prototype assay is as rapid as many existing techniques for detecting mutations. The Phase I results have laid the groundwork for the development and standardization of research kits for factor V using a microtiter plate format in Phase II. We will expand this work to develop a rapid test and kits for discrimination the three possible genotypes in a two-stage test. This test will utilize dual fluorescer energy transfer (FRET) assays. Detection will be based on energy transfer from a donor fluorophore-labeled oligomer to an acceptor fluorophore-labeled oligomer which become incorporated via the ligation-amplification process. Successful implementation of FRET-based detection will significantly shorten time to result. We will use the expertise gained in Phase I to develop two additional commonly used mutation tests related to clotting disorders, Factor II and MTHFR. As a final goal we will devise a multiplex test format for screening blood samples for each of these tests simultaneously. Use of different color fluorescers will distinguish the three mutations.",

        "abstract": "A significant number of bone and tissue combat injuries require surgical debridement, accompanied by irrigation with sterile water with simultaneous suction.  While this approach to removal of devitalized tissue has been quite successful, a debrided woundoften becomes infected due to insufficient irrigation (volume) or direct contact with pathogens via the irrigation water or surgical materials.  This problem is further complicated in battlefield scenarios where supply and casualty care logistics andavailability of sterile water are insufficient.  To overcome these obstacles, Lynntech has developed a rugged, lightweight debridement irrigation device, which incorporates two electrochemical technologies in tandem.  The device allows for in-linesterilization of any external source of potable water while providing a small amount of short-lived, safe, residual disinfectant to prevent infection.  In Phase I, Lynntech successfully designed and fabricated the irrigation water system, including boththe deionization unit and the ozone generator and demonstrated its sterilization efficiency on a variety of potential source waters.  Lynntech has also begun dialogue with a leading manufacturer of pulsatile irrigation devices, facilitatingcommercialization of the unit.  The Phase II will focus on construction, testing, and delivery of the unit to be further tested in vivo for proof of performance and safety.  Manufacture of sterile water at the point of use is attractive for uses within themedical/surgical areas and in general in water treatment.  A direct avenue to commercialization is evident for military field hospitals, civilian emergency response (natural disasters), industrial first aid, rural and developing country medical treatment,and mobile veterinary care.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Research (SBIR) Phase II project is concerned with the development and commercialization of electrochemically operated devices that will revolutionize the disinfectant industry by providing on-site, on-demand generation of extremely potent dual disinfectants. Peroxyacids are well known disinfectants that remove even resistant microorganisms (i.e. spores) by attacking S-S and S-H bonds on cell walls. The conventional method of manufacturing peroxy acids involves mixing concentrated hydrogen peroxide, an organic acid, and a catalyst (usually concentrated sulfuric acid), and involves the transportation and storage of hazardous chemicals. During the Phase I, the feasibility of a novel approach for the generation of the dual disinfectant was amply demonstrated. In this process, reactants for converting organic acids to dual disinfectants are generated within the device, avoiding problems associated with storage. All the criteria of success specified have been successfully accomplished and a well-known industrial partner has shown a keen interest in commercializing the novel devices. In Phase II, further optimization of the electrochemical devices will be followed by fabrication of prototypes of three devices for demonstrating their efficacy for a variety of disinfection applications. \n\nThere is a considerable need for devices that produce potent disinfectants that are biocidal against a broad spectrum of microbes including spores and viruses. These devices that produce potent disinfectants on-demand have commercial potential in domestic health care and food service establishments as well as in infection control applications in hospitals and nursing homes.

Waterborne diseases remain one of the most significant threats to human health worldwide, resulting not only in human suffering, but in significant economic loss as well. Ozone (triatomic oxygen) is a potent oxidant with many attributes as a disinfectant including the ability to inactivate a broad spectrum of waterborne pathogens. Although ideal for Point of Use water treatment, ozone has been difficult to generate on a small scale with conventional methods, restricting the use of ozone to relatively large scale water treatment installations. This Phase I study has demonstrated the feasibility of a new miniature electrochemical device for ozone generation.

        "abstract": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: The seafood industry is well aware of the need for maintaining product quality. It has traditionally relied on subjective sensory analysis through human sniff tests for the assessment of seafood freshness. However, experts are costly and too few in number. Alternative objective tests are expensive, complicated, time consuming, require toxic chemicals and destructive sampling, and are difficult to perform outside the laboratory. Therefore, there is a great interest from the seafood industry for simple, fast, low-cost, portable, easy-to-use instruments that can rapidly assess seafood freshness. The novel sensor described here combines three unique approaches: an array-based chemical sensor, composed of incrementally different conducting polymers; a unique signal transduction system allowing the detection of very small signals; and an on-board microcomputer, custom-programmed into a Field Programmable Gate Array. The Phase I study demonstrated that the lab-scale sensor can (1) successfully identify chemicals related to seafood freshness/spoilage, and (2) provide direct assessment of seafood freshness when real seafood samples were evaluated. No chemicals are required, it is not a destructive test, and it is an easy approach consisting on sniffing the sample under study. During the Phase II project, a hand-held sensor for assessment of seafood freshness will be developed and tested.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The beneficial effects of Long-term Oxygen Therapy (LTOT) in the home for patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and other lung diseases causing hypoxemia, are well known. The number of patients with COPD is increasing in most countries, and in the U.S., it is now one of the leading causes of death. LTOT increases a patient's survival rate and also has the potential to improve considerably a patient's quality of life. Since LTOT must be given for as long as possible during the day, it is important to extend daily hours of oxygen therapy into the mobile period of the day. This can be achieved through the use of compact, lightweight, portable sources of oxygen gas. Thus, there exists a clear need for a new technology-based oxygen generator that satisfies all the requirements for LTOT both within and outside the home. Currently, providing ambulatory oxygen with LOX systems is problematic because of the cost of LOX and hence lower profit margins for suppliers. The aims of portable oxygen are to increase exercise tolerance, reduce exercise dyspnea, improve quality of life, and extend the daily hours of LTOT. In response to the identified need, this project is specifically aimed at improving the delivery of oxygen to ambulatory patients in the home and office setting using an innovative electrochemical life support system. The technology will have a dramatic improvement in clinical benefits, patient convenience and delivery costs. The portable electrochemical system will produce on demand a supply of humidified, but otherwise pure, oxygen gas, while having a system weight less than 10 Ib and system power requirements less than 600 Watts. The system will provide instantaneous start-up and it is estimated that the oxygen generator will cost less than $1,000. A dual-use development approach will be adopted because the portable electrochemical oxygen generator technology has both government and other commercial applications such as battlefield life support, forward medical treatment areas, casualty transport vehicles, \"oxygen trickle charger\" for commercial and military aircraft, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy for decompression sickness, air embolism, and carbon monoxide poisoning.",

The most serious contamination to date occurred in ground ware\nsupplies in California, where 20 production wells are closed due to high MTBE\ncontamination. USEPA currently classifies MTBE as a possible carcinogen in its\nlargest directive this year and has decided to phase out the use of MTBE in\ngasoline. In the coming years, this nation faces a formidable task of ensuring\nthat our drinking water supplies are free of MTBE. MTBE is not readily amenable\nto treatment by conventional techniques. It is high solubility in water (50g/L)\nlimits adsorption on to activated carbon. Other oxidative techniques produce\nbromate ions far exceeding the allowed maximum concentration level (MCL) of\n10mg/L in drinking water. Hence, efficient non-oxidative alternatives to remove\nMTBE from water are highly desirable and are urgently needed.\nThe aim of this proposal is to develop a cartridge filter using a remarkably\neffective separation technology developed at Lynntech. Based upon the Phase I\nresults, this technology would lead to the development of a cartridge that\ncould supply MTBE safe drinking water for more than six months to household of\nfour. Projected sale price of such a cartridge is about $25.00.

The device proposed is a system suitable for use with any dental unit, producing both an on-demand disinfectant to remediate biofilms within the dental unit water lines and a quality irrigant well below the ADA recommended goal of 200 cfu/ml. The device has the added advantages of requiring minimal user intervention and no consumables. The in line system uses a combination of an ultraviolet germicidal lamp to eliminate organisms from the incoming water stream, and an electrochemical cell which produces hydrogen peroxide on-demand at two concentrations. The higher concentration will be used as a periodic flush to rid lines of biofilm contamination, while the lower concentration will be used as a continuous biostatic agent in the irrigant. The Phase I study has demonstrated that the device is both feasible and effective. The proposed device is fully scalable, can be manufactured using inexpensive parts, and is electrically driven making it attractive technology for a wide range of commercial applications.",

The product simplifies bacterial growth in tightly spaced microtiter plates, yet still result in robust culture with DNA yields greater than equivalent volume grown in Erlenmeyer or larger shaker test tubes. In phase II, we will further develop and optimize an aeration/agitation prototype device that was successfully experimented with in Phase I. This prototype uses a controlled stream of pro-heated, sterile, humidified air that is passed through the culture medium to simultaneously accomplish aeration, heating and agitation of the tightly packed cultures. The prototype works well with small and large culture volumes ranging from 50 mu l to 1.5 ml, and thus could be used for growth in 96 or 384 deep well plates. The DNA yield from culture volumes as low as 300 mu l was sufficient quantity to perform several automated DNA sequencing reactions resulting in long, high accuracy reads. The proposed product will be inexpensive to construct and will operate in a completely self-contained, compact manner without an external incubator, shaker, stirrer or oxygen source as are used with other devices that accomplish this task. We believe, based on prototypes developed in Phase I, the device can be sold for less than $2000. This price compares favorably to competitor products costing $7500 to $30,000.  \n  \nThe product will greatly enhance the ability to grow and prepare DNA from recombinant cultures, thereby improving the quality and throughput of large-scale DNA sequencing and analysis efforts. It will also be highly useful in molecular biology labs that are increasingly faced with growth and preparation of larger numbers of recombinant DNA samples. The product address the molecular biology researchers found in over 40,000 labs throughout the world. It has a market potential of $200-300 million dollars and will save significant research dollars both in private companies and grant-funded non-profit labs.",

This has been independently demonstrated by several investigators including Atlantic Research Corporation,a commercial propellant manufacturer.  The extreme electrostatic discharge (ESD) sensitivity of zirconium metal has prevented its use in high density impulse propellants.In a Phase I program, MACH I demonstrated the feasibility of a surface passivation technology for zirconium.  Zirconium ESD sensitivity was dramatically improved from 0.00025 to safe levels of greater than 0.02 joules.  Since this technology involvesforming a surface intermetallic with aluminum, there should not be a significant impact on reactivity or density impulse.  We are proposing a Phase II program to optimize and commercialize the passivated zirconium production process and high densityimpulse zirconium propellants.  Atlantic Research Corp. would be a subcontractor to MACH I testing reactivity and other propellant properties.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Tumor specific therapeutic antibodies direct the immune system to eliminate or prevent growth of tumor cells. Passive and active humoral immune responses are mediated via interactions between the IgG Fc domain and specific Fc receptors (FcR) present on the surfaces of effector cells. Proof of principal experiments show that it is the interaction between tumor specific antibodies and the FcR activating receptors on the surface of immune system effector cells that mediate tumor cell depletion. Modulation of the binding activity of the Fc domain to satisfy specific Fc receptor binding parameters will enable genetically engineered antibodies to act as efficient antitumor drugs. Novel Fc mutations that enhance the affinity of the Fc domain to FcgammaR3A and decrease the affinity to FcgammaR2B may play an important role in development of new therapeutics. These novel scaffolds could be ligated to Fabs that target tumor specific antigens and ultimately used as therapeutics to mount a successful cytotoxic response against tumor cells. Recent advances in proteomics and cDNA microarray technologies have aided in the identification of a number of tumor specific antigens. These peptides have been used for the development of antibodies that target specific cancer cells. To enhance the immune response against tumor cells we have developed a novel genetic screen to identify Fc mutants that preferentially bind to the activation receptor FcR3A. Further research and development of these Fc mutants should lead to therapeutic antibodies with increased capacity to trigger antibody dependent cytotoxic reactions against tumor cells. This proposal describes an experimental paradigm to identify Fc mutations, characterize the mutations in functional assays, and ultimately test therapeutic antibodies harboring the best Fc mutations in animal model studies.",

NMR is utilized extensively by the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, but remains one of few analytical methods in which parallel data acquisition has not been applied to increase the number of samples that can be simultaneously evaluated. The reasons behind this are the intrinsically related to the hardware involved in data acquisition. Poor throughput (i.e. relatively long time required for NMR analysis) remains a formidable challenge in drug discovery and development. The company submitting this proposal has a demonstrated track record of using SBIR funding to commercialize novel microcoil (capillary-based) NMR probe technologies. This proposal builds upon the speed and throughput advantages that have been achieved in capillary scale NMR to further advance high throughput screening through multi-sample analysis using a single probe. Technical aspects of both probe design and sample management is addressed. The long-term implications of this technological advance to health and health-related companies, particularly pharmaceutical companies, are significant.

It is designed to engender a multimodal therapeutic response by establishing a lytic infection in prostate tumor cells by enhancing the tumoricidal effects of radiation therapy and by enhancing the immune response to endogenous tumor antigens. The genome of one of the viral components, Max-AdlL-3, contains the adenoviral-inverted terminal repeats for replication, the adenoviral packaging signal, the E1 genes with E1A under the control of a prostate specific antigen (PSA) promoter, and an IL-3 expression cassette. This vector propagates only in cells that express PSA when the helper adenoviral vector is also present.

In Phase II, Mainstream along with our commercial radar partner, willdemonstrate the benefits of spray cooling a multi-channel transmitter (module-level).  Based on Phase I test results, a 40% increase in power output, a 30% increase in efficiency, and an order of magnitude increase in reliability are expected.  Thisenabling thermal technology has immediate application to MDA's Medium Extended Air Defense, Theater High Altitude Area Defense, Ground-Based Midcourse Defense, Sea-Based Midcourse Defense, and Advanced Concepts Programs and can be extended to otherhigh-heat-flux cooling applications including MDA's Airborne Laser, Space-Based Laser, and Kinetic Energy Laser Programs.",

        "abstract": "Warfighter decision-making is increasingly being pushed down to lower-levels of command in search of better and more rapid response.  This increases requirements for simulation-based assessment, training, and mission rehearsal.  Unfortunately, the C2Imodeling of both adversary and friendly forces in simulation is poor, requiring too much labor to set up and run simulations.  Even though process-based AI approaches are labor-intensive, they can still produce unrealistic models.  Improved cognitivemodeling, especially when capable of learning, holds promise to address the C2I modeling problem, enabling better simulation-based assessment, training, and mission rehearsal, without prohibitively high labor costs.During Phase I, M\u00bfK Technologies identified key technologies that can be used to develop a robust behavior representation and generation system. These technologies were prototyped within a commercial CGF system.  The Phase I research and prototypes providea strong foundation for Phase II development and commercialization.  M\u00bfK will also leverage its experience in developing powerful, yet easy-to-use toolkits to create a mechanism that will allow the community at large to access the behavior representationtechnology developed under this effort.The proposed approach builds upon a previous successful integration of MIT developed Behavior Based Robotics technology with an HLA-compliant CGF.  In addition to achieving believable, unpredictable, adaptable C2Isurrogates, the proposed Phase II approach lays a foundation for future development by providing tools for use by future CGF developers and users to create new, realistic, complex behaviors.  It also enables R&D into the development of standards forbehavioral representation.  It enables advanced research of CGF-based human behavioral modeling. If successful, the results of this effort will be incorporated into MAK's commercial CGF product, and transitioned to other DoD programs, such as OneSAF andthe STRICOM Robotics STO.",

The gas samples are drawn into the system through long heated sampling lines using pumps which increases the analysis time.The proposed MEMS Exhaust Monitoring System greatly simplifies current AEDC engine test activities, as it can be directly integrated with specialty sample probes, providing much faster response time and eliminating the need of long, heated lines andpumping systems.

Significant advances have been made in this area in the pasttwenty years, culminating with introduction of alloys AF1410 and AerMet100. Unfortunately the enhancement of properties was typically obtained through expensive processing and through use of substantial concentrations of cobalt and nickel. This drove theprice of such alloys 6-10 times that of ordinary steel. At such price levels these grades are only suitable for the most exclusive and critical applications.Phase I research demonstrates feasibility of producing steel alloys with similar level of strength and toughness as that of HP9-4-20 and AerMet100, but at substantially reduced cost. This is accomplished through utilization of conventional production /processing methods and elimination from the composition of very expensive cobalt. These researchers believe that continued development will lead to production of an alloy with yield strength of 235-250 ksi and impact strength of 30-32 ft-lb but atproduction cost of under $1 per pound. This would represent a significant improvement over alloys currently utilized in the area of air delivered munitions.",

Nanotubes that are too long are a particular problem resulting in low hardness and ballistic performance.  Excellent results were achieved, however, usingshorter nanotubes that still have relatively high aspect ratios of ~100.

The Phase II program will include development and demonstration of test protocols forcharacterizing the stress-rupture behavior of composite strands and laminated architectures, demonstration of analysis procedures for relating the statistical variability of unidirectional composite strand failure data to the composite laminate level andultimately the COPV level. The lifetime certification methodology to be produced by this research, and lead-the-fleet testing needed to continuously update life extension recommendations, will be demonstrated on a COPV design to be manufactured by LincolnComposites.A recent study has concluded that if the service life of these pressure vessels can be extended to as much as 30 more years, the DoD could realize an acquisitions cost savings exceeding $500M.  The research proposed by MSC is expected to yieldthe statistically based test and analysis protocol necessary to design COPV for extended service lifetimes.  Once derived and validated, the lifetime certification methodology will be presented to government regulatory agencies such as the NationalInstitute of Standards and Testing and the Compressed Gas Association for approval.  Hence, the research program outlined in this proposal has the potential to impact virtually every COPV in the commercial market.",

        "abstract": "A software package is needed that can efficiently model typical composite bonded and co-cured joints used in Naval ship construction.  This package must be able to accurately compute the strain-energy-release-rate for user defined cracks.  During the PhaseI, Materials Sciences Corporation demonstrated that an existing code called SUBLAM could perform these operations efficiently and accurately.  SUBLAM uses closed-form solutions of high-order plate assemblages.  Additional analysis features were addedduring the Phase I, and a graphical user interface (GUI) for the code was begun.  The Phase II program is designed to bring the code to commercial readiness, including completion of the GUI.  Critically needed analysis features will be added, including theability to handle non-plate regions such as fillers and irregular core shapes.  Documentation, testing, and verification are also featured in the Phase II program. The completion of the Phase II program will result in an analysis tool that is clearlyneeded by the composite shipbuilding community.  Currently, engineers that are not specialist in composites and fracture mechanics do not have a viable method for predicting the strength of many joints used in composite construction.  The planned productwill provide this critically needed tool.  The immediate impact will be on ships such as DDX and Composite High-Speed Vessel (CHSV) that make extensive use of composites.  However, the market can easily be extended to other composite applications includingaircraft, ground vehicles, and infrastructure applications.",

        "abstract": "70437S02-II   Increasing the power density of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) can substantially reduce the costs of SOFC technology by decreasing the stack size, which in turn decreases the amount of materials necessary, reduces the size of the balance of plant, and decreases the size and amount of requisite stack hardware and insulation.  Likewise, lowering the operating temperature of SOFC lowers costs due to higher operating efficiency and the use of inexpensive metallic materials, less thermal insulation, and simplified heat management.  This project will develop an anode-supported, thin-film YSZ electrolyte SOFC with composite cathodes comprised of the ionic conductor Lanthanum-Gallate (LSGM) and an electrocatalyst.  Because LSGM exhibits high oxide ion conductivity (higher than YSZ), it can substantially lower the overpotential at the cathode and thus increase the power density of the SOFC.  In addition, the thin-film YSZ electrolyte (~5 microns) and the LSGM-based composite cathode would enable the SOFC to operate at lower temperatures (600-650\u00bfC).  In Phase I, anode-supported SOFC with thin-film YSZ electrolytes and composite cathodes (comprised of the ionic conductor LSGM and electrocatalysts LSM, LSC, and LSCF) were developed, fabricated, and tested.  Exceptionally low cathode overpotentials, which resulted in significant increases in SOFC performance, were demonstrated with the use of LSGM-based composite cathodes.  Phase II will identify other electrocatalysts for use with LSGM, dope the LSGM to further improve ionic conductivity, and synthesize nanosize powders in order to engineer the desired cathode microstructure.   Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  SOFC, capable of delivering high power density while operating at intermediate temperatures, should have application in both consumer and military sectors including distributed power, transportation, residential, automotive, and portable power.  Advantages of SOFC include the ability to operate on various hydrocarbon fuels at high efficiency and with low pollution.",

        "abstract": "Loss of Line of Sight (LOS) due to low and high frequency vibrations in fast maneuvering THAAD missiles can result in catastrophic mission failure. The ability to hit a Re-Entry Vehicle (RV) carrying a nuclear/biological/chemical warhead either in themid-course of the terminal phase, is directly related to the capability of the sensor to maintain an accurate LOS to assure an accurate hit-to-kill based on an isolated and stable sensor platform. The high velocity of the THAAD missile, at just under 1mile/s, introduces a great deal of vibration in the missile seeker, resulting in poor imaging capabilities, hence leading to missed targets. Vibration isolation in these missile seekers is currently performed using passive damping device such asviscoelastic mounts. Materials Modification Inc (MMI) proposes to eliminate the vibrations significantly and provide an accurate control of the LOS using a revolutionary MR fluid based isolator technology developed through the Phase I. This SBIR Phase IIeffort will demonstrate the capabilities of this technology by conducting laboratory scale testing. This will be followed by a ground scale testing at BAE Systems by integration of the MR isolators to the THAAD seeker.",

The solid-state-converted (SSC) material is a highly oriented piezoelectric that displays thehigh strain/high coupling characteristics of expensive melt-grown single crystals. A subscale transmit array will be fabricated and tested to characterize the transducer design and the performance of the SSC material. Based on the Phase I modeling results,an increase of 5 dB in source level and a 15% increase in bandwidth is expected over conventional 1-3 piezocomposite transducer materials.BENEFITS: Solid-state-converted piezoelectric composite is a new high strain/high coupling transducer material whichcan enhance sonar performance in several ways. The high strain capability enables higher source levels to be achieved in projector applications. Conversely, the size and weight of a given projector can be decreased or the drive voltage reduced withoutpenalizing source level. The material's high electro-mechanical coupling and low mechanical quality factor (Q) results in increased transducer bandwidth and efficiency. Greater bandwidth improves array resolution and image quality in mine hunting and seafloor mapping sonars and also extends functionality to lower frequencies which are difficult to cover with traditional materials. The SSC material also has a very high dielectric constant which reduces cable losses and improves transducer signal to noiseratio. Demonstration of improved sonar performance on an existing Navy platform will facilitate these transition of the SSC materials into other applications that have requirements which cannot currently be met using conventional materials.",

Unfortunately, this increases the amount of time for patients to receive their test results or physicians to plan a course of treatment. Present day point-of-care-testing (POCT) immunoassay systems provide rapid results, but they are known for their poor accuracy and sensitivity, and often limited to qualitative or semi-quantitative assays. MSI has proposed to develop a portable, integrated, POCT system, by combining a self-contained, miniaturized chemiluminescence chip (CLCHIP) and microfluidic technologies that will dramatically improve POCT accuracy, sensitivity, and reliability. This innovative CLCHIP platform utilizes microfabrication technology to automate microfluidics for multi-analyte and multi-step biochemistries and reduce a complicated procedure to a single step. During Phase I of this project, we designed and fabricated microfluidic biochips with patterned microchannels, developed an on-chip chemiluminescence immunoassay protocol, performed a luteinizing hormone and troponin I bioassay, obtained linear dose-response curves, and achieved a total assay time of 15 minutes. Based on the foundation of Phase I we will move into Phase II, in order to optimize CLCHIP development, complete system integration, perform various analyte assays, multi-analyte panel testing, and achieve clinical performance requirements.",

Sealing of propellant gases hampers application of CTA. Phase I Modeling and Simulation Studies (design, analysis, manufacture, and testing of concept prototypes) demonstrated that MSI's Nitinol C-ring seal (NICRS)concept has likelihood of success in FCS application. The Objective Force Capabilities must be responsive, deployable, agile, versatile, lethal, survivable, and sustainable.  In close cooperation with ARDEC, MSI's Phase II Nitinol seal development willsupport these objectives, achieving zero-emission sealing, ejection ease, field tolerance, and minimum cost (under $5).  Nitinol seals will be fabricated, ballistically tested, and revised to meet Army requirements.    A final prototype will be drafted andmanufactured, with production procedures optimized versus cost by MSI, ARDEC, and the selected manufacturer APC.  APC has been contracted because of its excellent experience in seal manufacture and Nitinol seal R&D.  It is expected that seal designsachieving stated CTA goals will apply to other munitions, e.g. the medium range munition (MRM) packages for the Multi-Role Armament and Ammunition System (MRAAS) for FCS, and mortar projectiles.The product of this prototype development will directlybenefit the U.S. Military in its Future Combat Systems (FCS) effort.  MSI, with contracted support from major seal manufacturer APC, will overcome the challenge of producing an effective Nitinol seal within acceptable cost and production parameters. MSI'ssuccessful seal design for CTA ammunition will greatly contribute to the goal of lighter more efficient weapon systems, as well as provide a viable seal option for various high-temperature & pressure sealing applications such as the advanced Kinetic Energy(KE) projectiles, Medium Range Munition (MRM) for FCS, artillery and mortar projectiles, essentially for ammunition using conventional or Electro-Thermal Chemical (ETC) propulsion systems.   The knowledge base accumulated by MSI in its success with Nitinolin the sudden temperature rise and sonic strain rates involved in CTA application will allow MSI to offer designs for other applications in aerospace, automotive, and industrial actuation.

Because of the importance of social network mechanisms in human behavior, the software is also being designed to have wider commercial use in research, public health, government, and corporate markets. The public health value is substantial, because while it is relatively easy and inexpensive to gather egocentric nomination data (there are many existing data sets of this type), it is slower, more difficult, and costly to obtain sociometric data.  Phase 1 focused on the problem of linking members of large or unbounded networks, such as drug abusers in communities. The LinkAlyzer program matches and links egocentric records to construct sociometric data, allowing more complete network models to be applied. The approach was tested with a HIV drug abuse data set with 15,000 records and 100 million potential matches, generating a network model with results that support validity.  Phase II will create and test a larger SocioMetrica package of applications (including LinkAlyzer) designed to solve problems of commercial value. Assessment functions will be added to assist in gathering egocentric data. An extended set of social network measures will be implemented, and a platform will be created making it easier for users to implement their own network algorithms. Internet architecture will provide users with optional access to low-cost processing from powerful servers. This architecture will simplify software distribution, maintenance, and user support, and will facilitate multi-site project operations and data management.

While electrical ignition is reliable, electrical based primers are susceptible to premature ignition from EMI, EMP, orother stray or directed electromagnetic sources. In the event of a weapon jam, electrically initiated primers are dangerous as the potential for a static electrical discharge results in a risky task to safely unload and free the jammed mechanism.Furthermore, current electrical based primers contain lead styphnate, which is considered an environmentally hazardous material. The proposed effort will research the design characteristics of laser igniters, suitable for replacement of existing electricalignition systems, as used in small and medium caliber cannons. In addition to being inherently electromagnetically safe, laser ignition offers the possibility of utilizing `Green' or environmentally friendly propellants, primers, and boosters, therebyeliminating hazardous materials used in conventional primers and possibly reducing ammunition costs. As the intended application is for rotorcraft, particular attention will be directed to minimizing size, weight and power consumption while maintaining thestructural integrity to withstand high shock/vibration levels.In addition to providing a safer, more environmentally friendly ignition systems for medium caliber cannons, the proposed research effort will benefit other laser ignited armament systems aswell as provide potential commercial and military applications for miniature laser technology.

A dependable rubber supply is endangered by many factors, including susceptibility to pathogen attack, diminishing acreage as growers move toward higher value crops, increasing global demand for rubber, and changing political climates. Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia formed the International Tripartite Rubber Corporation, cut production by 4% and exports by 10 % for 2003, and caused the price of natural rubber to increase almost 100 percent from a 30-year record low of $0.48 to $0.83 per kilogram. There are several incentives to develop a US-based supply of natural rubber (see Public Laws 95-592 and 98-284). The occurrence of \"latex allergy\" strengthens the need for development of alternative sources of natural rubber. U.S. natural rubber production will be needed in the future to supplement and replace the 55% market share currently enjoyed by petroleum derived synthetic rubbers. The purpose of this grant is to determine if transcription factors from Arabidopsis thaliana can positively impact rubber or resin yield. Using traditional breeding programs, the best lines of P. argentatum produce about 10% rubber dry weight. However, wild P. argentatum plants can contain 20% rubber, so this level can be attained and tolerated. Our goal, therefore, is to increase the rubber yield without compromising the quality of the rubber produced.",

During Phase I, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of our combination of water vapor adsorption/desorption and heatstorage/transfer to significantly reduce the amount of water lost through respiration.  Our device offers substantial improvements in performance compared with the conventional, screen-based respiratory water recovery devices.  The combination of adsorbentand a regenerative heat exchanger allows for significantly better performance and lighter system weight.  When coupled with high-performance materials for thermal insulation, our respiratory water recovery system will achieve a water recovery rate of up to80 grams of water per hour at normal breathing rates.  Further, mesochannel architecture greatly reduces the pressure drop through the device, thereby making it easy to breathe through.  Our target pressure drop through the Phase II MAWRD is approximatelyhalf that of the M40 gas mask.During Phase II, we will develop our current system in to an optimized mesochannel-based system.  It will be a safe, rugged water recovery device for use by soldiers and others in environments where water must be conserved.  With the transition tomesochannel architecture, the Phase I system size and weight will be reduced and manufacturability will be improved.  The adsorbent particle size, pore size, and composition will be optimized.  A breathing filter for airborne particles will be added as anoption.  Further, we will develop a lightweight, comfortable interface system to attach the device to the user's face.The MAWRD will reduce the amount of water lost through respiration, help filter airborne particles from the air, and may help alleviate the occurrences of health problems associated with breathing dry air.  As the U.S. increases its military involvement inarid climates, a lightweight respiratory water recovery device will help alleviate the U.S. military's pressing need to reduce the logistical burden of supplying water to soldiers deployed in the field.  The system will not require an energy source and issimple to use:  the user need only don the mask and breathe through it.  With a total estimated adsorbent/substrate mass of 40 grams, the device will be able to conserve up to 80 grams of water per hour. Commercial applications for a lightweightrespiratory water recovery device include treatment for exercise-induced asthma, survival gear for arid environments, and air-to-air exchangers for buildings in hot, humid environments.",

Capture efficiency will be measured as a function of aerosol droplet size, microbe concentration, airborne residence time and relative humidity. The air sampler will be integrated with an automated immunoelectrochemical biosensor (developed and tested in the Phase I program), which will be capable of programmed sample acquisition (in the form of liquid aliquots), sample preconditioning (cleanup), and immunochemical labeling and quantitative detection.  System calibration will be based on microscopic cell counting, colony counting, and when needed, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR).    \n  \nThe fluidic components of the biosensor will be designed as a sophisticated three-dimensional microfluidic cartridge, which carries out functions of rapid antibody binding (using chaotic advective mixer technology), removal of unbound label, and of an amplified highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunoassay.  As an important practical feature, the reagents will be prepared in \"dry kits\" suitable for room-temperature storage.  The biosensor will selectively detect airborne pathogens within a 30-min timeframe post capture, at a sensitivity exceeding at least 100 times that of current bioagent strip tests; at a lower detection limit of 100-200 cells per sample.    \n  \nThe biocapture/biosensor unit will be tested in aerosol chambers (during the -02 year) and hospital rooms (during the -03 year) with TB patients (at San Francisco General Hospital) for quantitative assessment of airborne Mycobacteria, and exposure assessment for clinical personnel.  The modus operandi for the prototype design for applications in medical/clinical environment will be determined on the basis of results of the \"live\" aerosol tests.   \n  \nAlthough the main body of proposed research and technology development will focus on airborne Mycobacteria, it will be demonstrated that the resulting biocapture/biodetection technology will be equally applicable for monitoring of other airborne bacteria (Streptococcus pyogenes), fungi (Aspergillus fumigatus), and airborne viruses.  As such, proposed technology will deliver an essential tool for clinical, community-associated and environmental airborne pathogen monitoring.    \n  \nA product development/commercialization plan is proposed.",

If the natural gas from these fields could be converted to a liquid, it could be transported to markets using existing oil pipelines or ships.  This project will demonstrate a compact device for converting methane into ethane, a critical first step in the gas-to-liquids process.  This new approach, using chemical reactors capable of very fast heating and cooling rates, will improve the efficiency of the gas-to-liquids process and reduce the cost of the conversion reactors.  Phase I created a chemical and kinetic model of the methane-to-ethane conversion reactor, and showed that the new approach increases ethane yield.   Experiments of oxidative methane coupling also demonstrated increased ethane yield and confirmed theoretical predictions.  Practical methods for building the reactor microchannel structure were developed and demonstrated.  In Phase II, the reactor technology will be optimized for use with better catalysts under more favorable conditions.  A simple catalyst screening task will identify those catalysts that work best in the new reactor approach.  Modeling and design efforts will be conducted in parallel with the optimization effort to support the building of an integrated bench-scale demonstrator.  A heat exchanger design, which makes the improved ethane yield possible, will be optimized for a commercially viable assembly process.      Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  A reactor capable of converting natural gas to chemicals that are liquid at room temperature should enable remote gas wells to economically bring their resource to market.

Embedded sensors could achieve this requirement; however, the incorporation of sensors within harsh turbine environments represents a challenging task.  In this project, embedded sensors will be incorporated within thermal and environmental barrier coatings through a newly developed conformal direct write thermal spraying process for thick film sensors, providing an innovative means to integrate robust, reproducible, thermocouples and strain sensors onto engine components.  Phase I demonstrated that E and K-type thermocouples could be fabricated and incorporated within yttria stabilized zirconia thermal barrier coatings.   The sensors measured temperatures up to 1200oC within the coating and survived prolonged exposure in a furnace and burner rig environment.  Phase II will identify key components in turbine engines that are suitable for using this technology for condition monitoring.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator):  The long-term objective of this application is to identify a potent, efficacious and safe drug for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) through the use of our proprietary HepDirect prodrug technology. It is estimated that >170 million people are infected with Hepatitis C virus worldwide. Despite recent improvements in HCV drug formulations, a large segment of the patient population is still under treated. In the first phase of our SBIR grant support we demonstrated the potential of HepDirect prodrugs in selectively delivering high levels of phosphorylated nucleoside analogues to the liver. The work led to the identification of a development candidate (HepDirect-adefovir), which recently completed its initial Phase I clinical study and is expected to begin Phase 1/2 in early 2003. We now propose to continue the exploration of the HepDirect technology and its applications to a large and structurally-diverse set of nucleosides, with the goal of identifying a potent and selective inhibitor of HCV replication. Most nucleosides designed to be specific inhibitors of viral replication as the nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) fail as a result of poor recognition by the nucleoside kinases responsible for converting the nucleoside to the NTP. The HepDirect technology overcomes this limitation and allows us to pursue nucleoside analogues that are easily overlooked or discarded by companies pursuing standard drug discovery approaches. The specific aims of this application include the synthesis of a large number of HepDirect prodrugs of diverse nucleoside analogues, the production of the corresponding NTP library via the biological conversion of the prodrugs in hepatocytes, and the screening of this library for the inhibition of HCV replication. To support the antiviral activity determinations, a key aim is the development of a cellular assay compatible with the prodrug technology as well as a novel human tissue based HCV replication model. Following the identification of a lead inhibitor, the HepDirect prodrug moiety is optimized for intracellular activation efficiency, oral bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, as well as liver targeting. The final aim is to complete the requisite studies to launch the compound identified into full development for the treatment of HCV including second species pharmacokinetics, pilot animal toxicology, pilot in vitro and in vivo genetic toxicology and general safety pharmacology.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the avalanche of publicity surrounding H. pylori infection, children have been the one segment of the population that has been virtually ignored. However, there is a growing body of evidence that children, and especially minority children, are commonly afflicted with this disease. There are no FDA approved tests, other than the onerous endoscopic-based tests, to detect active H. pylori in children. We intend to address this need for a simple, minimally invasive and accurate diagnostic test for children. Metabolic Solutions has developed a test to determine the presence of active H. pylori infection that we named the Ez-HBT(TM). Although this is a blood test it should not be confused with serology tests that detect the presence of antibodies. The Ez-HBT(TM) is superior to antibody based tests because it detects the presence of gastric urease activity. Urease activity is only present when H. pylori have colonized the stomach. The test begins with the patient ingesting an oral dose of 13C-urea (non-radioactive label). The enzyme urease associated with gastric H. pylori breaks urea down into 13CO2 and ammonia. This results in an increase in the ratio of 13C/12C in blood carbon dioxide if H. pylori are present in the stomach. H. pylori infection impairs a child's growth, ability to function in school and may have long term implications for gastric cancer. The simplicity of the Ez-HBT(TM) including no test meal, a tablet that can be dissolved in a glass of water and a single traditional venipuncture makes it an ideal and cost effective tool for identifying H. pylori infection in children.",

Those results were based in part on our past success in applying an initial version of the PDV technology to a full-scale, operating rotor in the NASA 80-by 120-ft. wind tunnel. This Phase II program extends the initial technology to produce an advanced PDV system that incorporates state-of-the-art laser technology, modern imaging capabilities, and refined PDV data analysis methods. The proposed system willmaximize the image intensities, optimize the operational requirements of the instrument and provide image processing software and supporting documentation that enable a complete analysis of the experimental results by new users. The proposed tasks areessential steps leading to a fully developed PDV system that can be routinely applied to full-scale aerodynamics testing programs and subsequently commercialized for a broad range of industrial applications where remote measurements of large-scaleaerodynamic and hydrodynamic flow fields are not practical by other means.",

        "abstract": "This Phase II proposal is for developing a whole-field digital laser vibrometer (WDV) system capable of detecting buried landmines from a moving platform. Experiments have shown the feasibility of this technique to measure ground surface profiles aboveburied objects. We anticipate that the proposed system will be capable of detecting the presence of landmines at a rate of 1 m2 in tens of milliseconds. Furthermore, the proposed WDV would not be affected by the Doppler shift due to the platform motion. Adual pulse laser system would allow optimizing the signal as a function of acoustic excitation frequency. An innovative speckle reposition strategy would allow movement of the measurement platform at high speeds while still obtaining measurements withprecise interferometric resolution. To date, laser-acoustic systems have been successfully demonstrated with a stop and scan technique and mainly in a downward-looking configuration. The proposed WDV would help to overcome both of these limitationsenabling a practical system for either direct or confirmatory measurements. The Phase II work will consist of experimental work, design, and construction of a prototype system and fieldwork to demonstrate the developed system in a landmine field.Theproposed system will be capable of measuring surface vibration from a platform moving at several m/s. This system, upon development, will provide inspectors with a powerful tool for safely detecting the presence of landmines. These concepts also have wideapplication in the area of non-destructive inspection for the automotive, aerospace, machinery, and construction industries.",

This demonstration employed Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) inconjunction with acoustic excitation of the composite surface. Its operational principle is predicated on the observation that changes in the surface vibrational pattern of the test subject reveal underlying structural defects within the material bulk.Measurement and analysis of the surface velocity spectrum therefore serves to detect the presence of subsurface material irregularities associated with disbonds and delaminations. To facilitate an evaluation of structural integrity in large-scalecomponents and complex mechanical systems, MetroLaser, Inc. proposes a Multiple-Beam LDV (MB-LDV) instrument capable of simultaneously measuring the surface vibrational pattern at multiple beam locations. This instrument would substantially increaseinspection rates and provide a framework for the practical implementation of a portable, field-ready instrument that addresses inherent limitations in current scanning LDV systems.

Theprimary objective for Phase I of this Small Business Innovative Research project was to develop an approach for providing multi-modal interface design support to system designers and developers.

MIDA represents an integrated approach to multi-modal interface design that examines the goals and characteristicsof the user, the tasks the user must perform, and the environment in which the resulting interface will be used.  MIDA incorporates task network modeling to help identify resource conflicts and a comprehensive library of multi-modal technologies and designguidance to generate recommendations for design.  In this report, we describe the work proposed for Phase II. The initial benefit of the Multi-modal Interface Design Advisor (MIDA) will come from supporting upgrades to the interfaces of the TacticalTomahawk Weapons Control System.  However, virtually any interface from head-up displays to personal digital assistants can be designed with the help of this tool.  Long-term benefits of MIDA will be its potential for increasing the awareness and use ofmulti-modal interface technology.

MIDA can also ensure that interface design will be done right the first time, preventing the need for multipleiterations of design and testing.",

        "abstract": "Reductions in crew sizes and the increased use of autonomous machinery control have caused the crewmember to become more of a supervisory controller, where a computer makes complex transformations on system data to produce integrated (chunked) displays forthe human, or retransforms crewmember commands to generate detailed control actions.  In this environment, it is critical for humans to know how and when to intervene.  When humans do not attend to the information display or fail to recognize that statuschanges shown in the display require intervention, or when cognitive workload is so high that they miss a critical signal, they are not maintaining adequate situational awareness.  Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate display/controller interaction todetermine whether the human can reasonably maintain adequate situational awareness to prevent omissions and errors.  This project will result in the development of a tool that can be used by HSI professionals to identify tasks that have a high potentialfor human overload and error.  The proposed tool can be iteratively used to design and evaluate the interfaces that provide information in shipboard supervisory control systems to maximize the probability that the operator will maintain adequatesituational awareness and respond appropriately.  The issues that are currently driving the acquisition of military and commercial hardware systems are those that revolve around personnel costs, system performance, and safety.  Designers and manufacturersof advanced commercial systems must respond to the pressure to be more cost effective without sacrificing efficiency and safety.  The proposed software tool will advance the state of the art in human systems integration technology because information aboutthe ability of sailors to detect, process, and comprehend information presented in complex displays will be used to impact system design.

        "abstract": "The proposed research program seeks to continue development a totally new methodology for the fabrication of polymer-based Electrooptic (EO) waveguide devices and subsystems-on-a-chip.  Other manufacturers use conventional spin-coating or dip-coatingtechnology for these products.  However, these techniques constrain the selection of polymers for the EO waveguide layer and for the upper and lower cladding layers because of the need to use solvent systems that will not disrupt the previously depositedlayers.  To avoid having to expose the polymer layers to potentially harmful solvents, MCT proposes to continue the successful Phase I development of MicroCoating Technologies' (MCT) patented Nanomizerr spray deposition technology for the fabrication ofoptically clear polymer cladding films.  The key feature of the proposed approach is MCT's unique nozzle design that disperses a liquid solution of the polymer (or reactive oligomers) into sub-micron droplets.  This allows the solvent to flash-evaporate asthe droplets travel toward the substrate, and results in the deposition of a pinhole-free film with minimal solvent exposure to the substrate.  In addition, it enables the fabrication of mode-matched waveguides having adiabatic tapers, with graduatedthickness and refractive index profiles.  To ensure that MCT will be working with state-of-the-art materials, MCT has established a teaming relationship with the research group of Professor Larry Dalton, a world leader in EO polymer development, for theon-going Phase I project.   The proposed Phase II project will greatly enhance the selection of polymer materials for each layer of an EO polymer device, and will allow device designers to focus on the key properties of refractive index, conductivity,thermal expansion, and optical quality without having to be concerned with solvent compatibility issues.",

A prototype MicroTester will demonstrate the capability to monitor interfacial reliability of detector areas of 10 um2 on the wafer.  The technique of measuring the interfacial fracture toughness using this testerwill also be developed including specimen preparation and data analysis.At the conclusion of the Phase II, a prototype MicroTester will be delivered which will include an operator-friendly loading stage, a state-of-the-art loading unit and loading controller, a fast image collection and processing program, and propertiesanalysis and reporting program. Detailed procedures for specimen preparation and MicroTester operation will be prepared for evaluating thin film modulus and interfacial fracture toughness of thin film and substrate. A reliability testing system with cyclicloading capacity will be developed based on interfacial fracture criteria of infrared detectors using atomic force microscope (AFM).  There is a tremendous commercial interest for thin film mechanical property measurement systems.  Current systems are notsuitable for accurate determination of mechanical properties coupled with detailed observation of damage evolution.  The product developed under this research will consist of loading stage, computer software and other instrumentation (i.e., AFM, videoframe grabber, etc.) necessary to obtain mechanical property measurements for a variety of thin films.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project is stimulated by the explosive growth of the wireless telecommunications industry.  There has recently been a great deal of interest in designing tunable RF devices that utilize ferroelectric thin films for their electronicproperties.  Specifically, barium strontium titanate (BST) thin films are being used to develop new classes of tunable microwave devices, including phase shifters and frequency-agile filters.  Today's commercial and military wireless systems are limited incapability due to the use of fixed-tuned filters in receiver front-ends and transmit output stages.  This project will develop frequency-agile filters using BST thin films deposited using Microcoating's proprietary CCVD process.  These filters, operatingin the 2GHz cellular band, will be capable of changing their operating frequency through the application of a DC control voltage. Currently, ferroelectric devices suffer from the need for large tuning voltages (100v), which are not readily available inmost commercial applications.  MicroCoating Technologies (MCT) proposes a unique electrode design that permits the separation of the DC bias voltage from the microwave AC signal, enabling high tuning ranges with bias voltages of less than 5v.  Lastly,temperature compensation of the BST film will be accomplished over the commercial temperature range.",

The capacity of the multi-fluid print head will be increased to 20 different fluids to increase throughput for multiple samples and/or to allow for different chromatography treatments. This system will provide for the maximum conservation of sample volume combined with the rapid LC separation of peptides, resulting in improved MALDI-TOF MS analysis through a reduction in ion suppression.

Sensors will be installed into a suitable tactical motor design and testingwill demonstrate that they do not effect the grain structural integrity and should determine the magnitude and location of potential failure modes.  These sensors will permit the determination, in real time, of the motor health and service life.  Real timeenvironmental history of a tactical motor propellant grain will be measured and stored in on-board memory.  Means for transmitting this data to the Remote Readiness Asset Prognostics/Diagnostics System (RRAPDS) will be investigated.  The resulting embeddedsensor package developed for this proposal could be leveraged as a Sensor Electronics Packages (SEP), subservient to the missile Asset Electronics Package; the primary means of communication with an RF interrogator.  This would permit RRAPDS to identify,count and measure the health of the munitions.Real time health monitoring of munitions would eliminate the need for expensive removal from use or storage for inspection and other non-destructive or destructive testing.  Hence, it would result inconsiderable savings on test facilities, eliminates potential damage during shipping and extend the useful life.  The embedded sensor technology also has the potential to monitor any polymeric interface in vehicles, buildings, pipelines, or DOE reactorvessels.

Polymer liners provide lightweight, long term, safe storage of Inhibited Red Fuming Nitric Acid (IRFNA) geland Mono Methyl Hydrazine (MMH) gel used in missile and space propulsion systems. The Phase II effort produces prototype gel propulsion tanks that will demonstrate technical viability of the approach, including throttleability, safety, long term storage,and operational suitability for a wide range of programs. Technical objectives include: final selection of materials that include fluorinated polymers with layers of plasma, metal, and wet chemistry deposition, definition of a pressure vessel usingBonded-Rolling-Diaphragm (BRD); fabrication of liners within filament-wound composite pressure vessels, burst and stress testing, manufacture of vessels, expulsion tests and demonstrations, and definition of manufacturing processes for efficiency,affordability, and quality. MPCI leads a team including Northrop Grumman Space Systems, North Carolina State University, 4th State, and SAIC/ERC. The team brings a vast array of sophisticated testing and analysis systems that are integrated via acomprehensive and detailed plan.Phase II yields a prototype system that proves the viability of specially treated polymer liners in a bonded-rolling-diaphragm configuration. The prototype enables repeated demonstrations of the technology. Demonstrationsallow program managers of NASA and all DOD components to assess the value of gel-fuel propulsion for multiple programs. Prototype demonstrations also serve as a development tool for designing gel-propulsion subsystems in a variety of configurations andapplications. The ultimate benefit is lighter weight, throttleable propulsion systems with multiple-fold increase in range-speed envelopes, and operational modes. Potential applications include: NLOS, Common Missile Block I, High Energy Laser, PrecisionAttack Munition, Loiter Attack Munition, Kinetic Energy Interceptor, and NASA( Mars Accent Vehicle). Our commercialization approach is two-fold: (a) continue teaming relationship with Northrop Grumman for multiple missile propulsion systems, and (b)acquire the manufacturing capability (primarily molding and deposition) to produce complete subsystems with high quality and responsiveness to new requirements. We also market polymer liners, which are extremely durable and resistant to the most corrosiveacids, to petro-chemical and other industries for cost-effective storage of chemicals.",

The development of a low cost, lightweight, modular on-board data storage system using commercial hard drives will meet the future storage needs of all government and commercial satellites.  The use ofhard disk drives in space holds great promise as it eliminates the need for continuous power, data densities are huge, and magnetic media are relatively immune to space radiation.  In the past, mass and power requirements during operation have made thisoption undesirable.  In recent years however, hard drives have become smaller, more rugged, and power consumption has been drastically reduced (all results of the commercial drive to smaller, laptop and handheld computing devices).  The MMSM provides amodular system incorporating hermetically sealed, vibration isolated Drive Modules along with an Electronics Control Module offering up to 800 megabits/second data rate through parallel hard disk drive control.

The small footprint and very high power levels combine to create extremely high heat fluxes in the vicinity of the diode.  Tese heat flux levels raise the diode temperature,leading to lower lasing efficiency, wavelength shifts, and reduced diode lifetime.  The cooling problem becomes even more difficult when combined with requirements for low pressure drops, low coolant flow rates, reliability, long operating life, ease ofattachment, small volume, and low cost.The best performing thermal management solutions available in the marketplace today are provided through micro-impingement and microchannel cooling methods, which offer thermal resistances as low as 0.035 K-cm2/W.  Many customers, however, have expressedinterest in achieving these thermal resistance levels at much lower coolant flow rates.

One method of reducing the time required for design of new systems, whileensuring the critical performance standards necessary for military operations, is to develop numerical simulations of cylinder-kit dynamics. These simulations will lead to the comprehension necessary to design a proper balance between the good sealingrequired for optimum performance and a high reliability, while simultaneously maintaining low friction and low wear. The Phase II technical effort includes verification of the predicted cylinder-kit kinematics and fluid transport using firing engine datafrom engines of interest and flow studies in an optical engine. Submodels of CASE will then be examined and improvements made where necessary. The final task of Phase II will deal with the commercialization aspects of the CASE System. This task willencompass the preparation of a book to describe the models and submodels implemented in the CASE System. An executable student version of the CASE System will be included as part of the purchase price of the book. This will stimulate the development of newcylinder-kit systems by providing a design tool, which at present is not readily available worldwide to large groups of engineers and students. The tribological research to be conducted in the Phase II effort is highly relevant to advanced diesel engines,for both the commercial and the military sector.  The critical performance tradeoffs of diesel engine fuel economy, performance, durability, oil consumption, smoke, and other considerations, cannot currently be made without huge expenditures of time andmoney. A scientifically based engineering approach is being developed to serve as a guide to the advancement of higher power, density diesel engines.  The numerical simulation, proposed to be further developed and verified in this Phase II project, offersthe possibility of not only improving diesel engine designs, but also significantly reducing the cost of these improvements. In addition to developing an advanced simulation tool that can be used by engine designers, the work conducted during this effortwill provide significant experimental verification of the models implemented in the CASE System, stimulating further confidence in its usefulness.",

They do have the disadvantage, however, of being bulky and complex because they are usually made up of many parts.  These problems are serious enough for the soldier thatmust carry them to warrant a constant effort in the development of fabrics for the design of smart systems that are able to cover a wide range of temperatures with a single, or at most a couple of garments.  In Phase I Mid\u00bf proposed to investigate thefeasibility of a system based on the use of novel fiber design and advanced materials that would solve this problem.  The basic idea was to design and optimize structure to produce fibers capable of transitioning from a flat to a three-dimensional shape.With the correct design, a network of fibers would result in a self-regulating fabric that can gradually transition from a flat, low-loft, low-R, configuration to a sufficiently high-loft, high-R, configuration.  In Phase II Mid\u00bf proposes to develop itsdemonstrated concept into a commercial prototype.Variloft will not only solve the needs of the US Army by providing a self-regulating garment that requires no external power or specialized training for use, but will also present an opportunity to improvethe quality of thermal protection technology for the outdoor, sport, rescue and medical industries.One of the direct benefits of this technology, that is applicable to all the markets mentioned above, will be the reduction of complexity in current layered systems and the coupled reduction in weight that must be carried by the user.  Another benefit isthe regulation of thermal transfer that depends not only on the external environment, but also on the internal environment.  This effectively regulates temperature by balancing the ratio of body heat generation with heat absorption, which means that iddoes not only limit heat loss, but also heat buildup.A further benefit is that the manufacturing tools and processes required for manufacture are the same as those used for other bicomponent nonwovens.",

        "abstract": "The U.S. submarine force strongly desires an improved situational awareness and a collision avoidance capability based on intercept of active emissions and detection of passive broadband signals. Our Phase I SBIR focused on the development of rapid 3D(range, bearing and depth) localization solution against active emissions detected on existing submarine sensors. The results of our Phase I study showed that accurate 3D localization solutions are achievable out to tactically significant ranges againstactive or passive sources in a 360-degree field of view provided that the active emission or passive signal is detected on at least four spatially separated sensors. Our Phase II SBIR focuses on the development and at-sea testing of a real timenon-collinear wavefront curvature ranging system. The real time system will use the SONARTECH/ATLAS Intercept Ranging and Detection System (IDRS) hardware and time difference of arrival (TDOA) estimation techniques as the basis for the SBIR Phase IIprototype system. Additional TDOA processing channels and interfaces will be added to this baseline system to accommodate existing and new sensors on a 688I class submarine. The non-collinear wavefront curvature ranging algorithm developed in Phase I willbe implemented in the IDRS hardware system. Additional displays and controls will be added to accommodate the increased number of processing channels. A graphical target motion analysis (TMA) algorithm will also be implemented to determine the velocity ofthe source of the active emissions. Finally, a Signal Feature Extractor (SFE) will be developed and implemented to determine the salient features of complex active emissions. The Phase II Option focuses on the estimation of the TDOAs against these complexactive emissions. In the option, the SFE will be implemented and integrated with match filter and replica correlators to determine the TDOAs associated with the complex active emissions. BENEFITS: MIKEL, INC is in a unique position to develop an improvedactive intercept system with the potential to form the basis of an improved situational awareness and collision avoidance capability. This is because MIKEL, INC has expertise in time delay estimation, non-collinear wavefront curvature ranging techniquesand in the development of target motion analysis  (TMA) algorithms and has a close professional relationship with SONARTECH/ATLAS, an expert in the development of real time TDOA estimation and wavefront curvature ranging systems (PIPRS and IDRS). Webelieve that a military commercialization opportunity may be available based on the technology developed and implemented under this SBIR. This opportunity would involve the transition of this technology to improved active intercept systems being consideredfor all classes of U.S. submarines, The initial customers would be PMS 415, PMS 425 and PMS 450. In addition, the results of this SBIR have applicability to commercial systems involving the detection and tracking of marine mammals, ocean exploration andharbor defense for Homeland Security.

Reducing the logistical burden imposed by tire servicing and carrying of spare tires and wheelswill help make a future force more agile and more rapidly deployable.

With comfort and easiness as the goal, automation and modernization in the past 50 years has dramatically reduced our PA, and completely changed our life style and work environment. Sudden decrease in physical activity can lead to body energy imbalance and diseases such as obesity and cardiovascular dysfunction, as evidenced by NHLBI recently announcement: \"About 97 million adults in the   United States are overweight or obese. Obesity and overweight substantially increase the risk of morbidity from hypertension; dyslipidemia; type 2 diabetes; coronary heart disease; stroke; gallbladder disease; osteoarthritis; sleep apnea and respiratory problems; and endometrial, breast, prostate, and colon cancers.\" The government health website (http:/Iwww.health.govlhealthypeop(e/LHI/) lists PA as the leading health indicator for the Nation over the next 10 years. Considering that 10% of positive energy imbalance can lead to 15 lbs of weight increase per year, an accurate device for quantifying PA and energy expenditure (EE) in free-living conditions becomes critical.  \n  \nThis proposal plans to improve and validate Intelligent Device for Energy Expenditure and Activity (IDEEA), developed by MiniSun LLC. for measuring PA and EE in free-living humans. The prototype demonstrated dramatic improvement and technical breakthroughs in functions and accuracy over previously available devices. The device records body posture and movement for 24-hrs or longer with time accuracy to sub-second, identifies 21 types of postures, 17 types of limb movement and posture transitions, and 6 types of major PA, including sleeping, reclining, sitting, standing, walking, ascending stairs, descending stairs, running, and jumping with 98.5% accuracy. IDEEA also computes the distance and speed of locomotion, the mechanical work and power of PA, and estimated EE of these activities using the state-of-art methods and techniques. We plan to improve the hardware/software design for ease of use by researchers and to reduce the production cost. We also plan clinical studies to further validate the device.",

These include the detection of illicit nuclear material for homeland defense, and cleanup of radioactive contamination from past nuclear weapons development.  However, these detectors exhibit a sensitivity to vibration that limits their applicability in the field.  This sensitivity is caused by a physical component (a fine wire grid) that is needed to make the detector output easily decipherable.  This project will develop technology for replacing this component with sophisticated computer processing to recover the output information.  Phase I demonstrated that the signal could be recovered and that the vibration sensitivity was greatly reduced.  Phase II will implement an instantaneous computation procedure and reduce the signal error to levels that are the same or better than before the grid removal.    Commercial Applications And Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The detectors should find use in the interdiction of nuclear material being smuggled into or out of the U.S., in the detection of nuclear material in a dirty bomb, and in the diversion of nuclear material from nuclear facilities under IAEA inspection.

Test results of a software implementation of the technology on actual systems and networks demonstrate the possibility of a 500% increase in application level throughput of network data with complete interoperability with existing systems.  Thegained system processing time can be used to provide increased network bandwidth and data throughput, and to accommodate the increased processing of system upgrades.  The significant investment in existing AMCOM and MDA program computers, operatingsystems, communication protocols, network interface units and network technologies is preserved because the software only implementation of the technology requires no changes to existing system components.  The interoperability of the final products, ahigh performance, bandwidth expanding JREAP, a IP/UDP/TCP library and CEES application, allow the application of the technology to existing systems, extending their life cycles by accommodating interoperability communications overhead. The anticipatedresult, an interoperable, able to be retrofitted, portable software library product that reduces data latency, increases processing efficiencies and improves bandwidth utilization by up to 500% will be very attractive to military and commercialcommunication systems, network components and applications.  The final product would provide the necessary network I/O throughput and processing performance improvements needed for implementing all anticipated real-time Missile Defense systeminteroperability communications functions.  The approach of applying the resulting software architecture and I/O, protocol library to network communications for all types of network communications and distributed systems could lead to numerous products andcommercial endeavors.  If added to applications, as opposed to host computers, the architecture can be used to offer high performance versions of existing and future network communicating applications such as Internet World Wide Web (WWW) browsers.

The proposed new design methodology, referred toas function-oriented material design (FOMD), will provide an effective tool for the optimal design of structurally efficient composites, such as those with optimally-shaped cellularity or, in fiber-reinforced composites, optimal arrangement of the fibers(made of carbon or other materials including metals).  The proposed new manufacturing methodology, referred to as the biomimetic process, will be developed to fabricate, in a unique way, the optimal design obtained from the FOMD process, thus resulting ina new generation of highly efficient and versatile structural materials.  With the design tool developed in this program, new materials will be optimally designed in order to meet the requirements for advanced structural performance and weight reduction.For example, the materials in the main and secondary structures of an air vehicle will be designed with respect to their specific performance requirements, hence achieving optimal design in terms of both global and local performance.  This will ensure thatthe weight of an air vehicle is distributed in the best possible way and that the structures are truly-optimally designed without waste of material.  The proposed biomimetic fabrication process will provide substantial control at microscopic andmacroscopic structural levels, and cover broad ranges and combinations of materials and systems (ceramics, metals and polymers).  This energy-efficient and cost-effective process can accommodate complex, three-dimensional geometric configurations, thuslowering the number of parts and joints.  Gradient structures can also be conveniently introduced, which facilitates the development of efficient systems with structural materials concentrated along optimum load paths.  The integrated nature of systems andthe high level of control over their gradient structure will provide designers with powerful tools for eliminating premature failure modes associated with local instabilities, out-of-plane bending, debonding, bearing and impact loads, and stressconcentrations.",

        "abstract": "Signal diversity combining is a powerful signal processing technique that significantly improves the link quality of satellite or wireless communications.A powerful application example is to increase the transmission speed of a mobile user terminal equipped with a low-gain antenna. As the user terminal transmits a signal through a hemispheric coverage antenna, the signal is received by multiple satellitesand combined at the Hub. For a given transmitter power (imposed by weight, power consumption and maximum safe radiation limits), the transmission speed will be multiplied by the number of satellites used.In a fading environment, the gain can be even greater than in an additive white gaussian noise linear environment as the spatial diversity of each signal replica makes it statistically unlikely that all replicas will be subject to fading at the same time.The proposed activities are-       Developing equipment for an end-to-end demonstration of signal diversity combining, including UHF mobile user terminals, hub modems, software drivers and monitoring & control software.-       Field testing with real and/or pseudo-satellite transponders. Perform extensive collection of subjective (voice quality) and objective (BER, lock status, etc) link performance.-       Improving the phase I simulation testbed capabilities to include more sophisticated propagation models.",

        "abstract": "Systems integration problems are magnified on large DoD projects built by distributed multi-contractor teams using heterogeneous information systems. The challenge is to rapidly access and exploit these information systems while managing costs and risks.Organizations have invested huge sums of money over many years in systems to operate their businesses successfully. These are mission-critical systems, but having been implemented over a number of years using different technologies, they rarely work wellwith each other. For example, operations and maintenance activities on major defense systems rely on information from many legacy logistics databases, such as CAMS and NALCOMIS. The non-integrated data in these systems needs to be integrated to enablereal-time, 360\u00bf-visibility into the parts, supplies, equipment and tasks required to support automated supply chain processing. Modus Operandi proposes the Collaborative Data Access (CODA) system to address these challenges. CODA uses an N-tier, openstandards-based architecture. CODA will integrate legacy and new systems into an object-oriented (OO) system. CODA will not replace existing systems but rather supports a uniform interface layer. Once systems are integrated, high-level functions supportingmulti-contractor activities such as program status and oversight, complex analysis and reporting, acquisition, system development, and collaborative heterogeneous information access can be accomplished. Benefits:- Reduced integration cost and risk- Rapid information discovery and understanding- Automated support for information modeling and data integration- Increased visibility into legacy system informationPotential Commercial Applications- Integrated workgroup support- Enterprise information systems integration- Supply chain management- Operations and maintenance (logistics)- Product engineering, support and management- Decision support systems",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G are serine proteases stored within the primary granules of neutrophils. The activation and degranulation of neutrophils at inflammatory sites result in the release of these proteases where they encounter inhibitors that regulate their activity in certain inflammatory conditions.  These proteases have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases. One example of an inflammatory disease associated with neutrophil recruitment is Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). COPD is a slowly progressive and incurable disease of the airways, characterized by a gradual loss of lung function. An estimated 20.9 million Americans are currently affected by COPD; of which 18.3 million suffer from chronic bronchitis and 2.7 million suffer from emphysema. Our Phase I study involved the development of two rationally designed mutants of Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor One (PAI-1). The normal targets for PAl-1 are the plasminogen activators tPA and uPA. The gene for PAl-1 has been altered to produce mutants with altered protease specificity. These two new mutant inhibitors now target neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G. Due to the unique properties of PAl-1, these mutants actually exhibit properties superior to the natural inhibitors Alpha One Proteinase Inhibitor and Antichymotrypsin. Specifically, these mutants both inactivate and facilitate the cellular endocytosis and degradation of the neutrophil proteinases in the presence of polyanionic surfaces such as heparin and DNA, which sequester these very basic enzymes. The DNA that codes for these mutants has been cloned into a E. coli bacterial construct for expression at very high levels, and a patent pending method for the purification of PAl-1 will be scaled up in our Phase II study. The Phase II proposal extends and expands our studies to include: improving the properties of the mutants for therapeutic use, further characterization of the performance of the mutants compared with commercially available and endogenous inhibitors in a number of animal models, development of sensitive and specific immunoassays for neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G and, a study to examine the large scale production of the PAl-1 mutants using a rapid patent pending purification process. Destructive lung diseases are a major cause of morbidity in the U.S. We believe that these mutants can be developed into therapeutic agents for the treatment of a variety of inflammatory diseases.",

Dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging offers the promise of an objective measure of dopaminergic degeneration allowing for identification of changes in the brain that occur early in the illness, prior to clinical diagnosis. The primary goal of this project is to examine the sensitivity and specificity of DAT imaging using [123I]beta-CIT and SPECT imaging as a diagnostic marker in subjects with suspected PD or PS. We have successfully completed the Phase I pilot study for this project and have utilized these data and experience in designing this Phase II SBIR proposed protocol. The overall study design is to recruit subjects with suspected PD from participating community neurologists and compare the baseline diagnoses of the community neurologists, movement disorders experts and dopamine transporter imaging to a 'gold standard' clinical diagnosis assigned by a movement disorder expert at 12 months follow-up. The DAT imaging diagnosis will be compared to the 'gold standard' clinical diagnosis to determine the sensitivity of [123I]beta-CIT and SPECT imaging as a diagnostic marker in PD and PS.

        "abstract": "70555S02-II     DNA sequencing is currently not possible when starting from single bacterial cells because of the limited amount of DNA present.  Typical medical and biological samples contain a heterogeneous mixture of species; therefore, obtaining a sufficient amount of DNA requires a time-consuming and labor-intensive approach involving the isolation and culture of bacterial cells.  Since most bacteria are simply unculturable, the vast number of these highly valuable microorganisms remains unstudied.  This project will develop a kit to amplify the whole bacterial genome from a single cell, allowing DNA sequencing that was previously not possible in many research projects.  In Phase I, a proof-of-concept was obtained for whole-genome amplification from a single Escherichia coli cell.  In Phase II, the DNA amplification technique will be extended to other bacteria that represent the diversity of commercially and medically important species encountered in natural field samples.  Methods will be refined for cell sorting, cell lysis, and DNA amplification.    Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee: The ability to sequence DNA from a single bacterial cell should greatly accelerate progress in many medical and basic research areas.  For example, it should be possible to accelerate the preservation of genetic archives at a time of vanishing habitats such as rain forests and coral reefs.

However, extended administration of these antiretroviral (ARV) agents is commonly associated with the emergence of resistant virus that often compromises treatment. The clinical management of ARV treatment experienced patients has been greatly facilitated by the development of phenotypic and genotypic drug resistance assays. The increase in the prevalence and spread of drug-resistant virus, including strains displaying broad cross-resistance to PR and RT inhibitors has necessitated the development of new therapeutic approaches to combat this highly adaptive virus. Inhibitors of HIV entry represent a promising new class of antiretroviral agents. The development of phenotypic and genotypic assays to detect drug resistant strains will undoubtedly accelerate the development of entry inhibitors and improve their utility in the clinic. Phase I support was used to develop a phenotypic assay that measures susceptibility of HIV-1 to entry inhibitors and a genotypic assay that detects resistance mutations in the HIV-1 envelope gene. Phase II support is intended to optimize, scale and validate these two resistance tests for routine use in a clinical reference laboratory environment.",

We are developing a biodiesel production process which focuses on the use of a low-cost feedstock (animal fat and recycled cooking oil), which combined with a low-cost production technology, results in product that is competitive in price with petroleum diesel. Nine billion pounds of animal byproducts and recycled vegetable oil are collected in the U.S., which can be potentially converted to 1.2 billion gallons of B100, which can replace 1.1 billion gallons, or 26 million barrels, of petroleum diesel fuel.

Apply the results to the design of a reliable prototype SX system that demonstrates improved mass transfer and phase separation, and decreased entrainment at power consumption levels equivalent to existing equipment.

        "abstract": "uture airborne UAV operators will perform as system supervisors, and will have inadequate resources for micromanaging UAVs under their control.  Monterey Technologies, Inc. and its subcontractor, ThoughtWave, LLC, will build and demonstrate a crew intentinferencing system to assist UAV operators, the Airborne UAV Control Module (AUCM).  The system will use aircraft state and pilot activity information, and mission domain knowledge to moderate crew interaction with numerous onboard associate systemsdepending on current system context.  A key innovation in the ACUM is its use during Pre-Mission Planning and/or Rehearsal phase so human-system automation issues are addressed before the mission begins.  Case-based reasoning and rule induction techniqueswill capture and assimilate a wide range of Army Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) for UAV management.  During the mission the AUCM will use real-time onboard and off-board data sources to match previously encountered situations in the casedatabase, and coordinate with the crew to adapt existing cases for use in new situations.  The system will be demonstrated in the Air Maneuver Battle Lab, Ft. Rucker, AL.  ACUM as a commercial product is applicable to most systems involving supervisorycontrol of semi-autonomous robotic entities.  Military and some civil applications include a range of UAVs, and robotic ground vehicles.The principal benefit of the intent inferencing is that it provides an implicit means of human-machine communication -the pilot can communicate with the intelligent system simply by performing the mission, much like an effective human team does. The AUCM thus will enable crews to interact with complex automation, such as UAVs,  in a similar way that crews coordinate witheach other. Crew intent information allows tasks to be performed without explicit crew command, and errors can be detected before they result in incidents and accidents.  World-wide, the UAV market is a multi-billion a year enterprise with a double digitgrowth rate.  AUCM can increase the effectiveness and reduce the crewing requirements for both airborne, and terrestrial based control.  Put another way, few operators will be able to control more vehicles.  In addition to the military applications, civilapplications for sea and uninhabited area surveillance will soon develop.  Target customers include the over forty companies involved in UAV development and production of UAVs., e.g., Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Bell Helicopter Textron and several Japanesecompanies.  Intent inferencing is broadly applicable to military and civil supervisory control systems where the human supervisor may be performing multiple tasks or has highly variable workload.",

These techniques have been designed to increase the reliability of microelectronic devices under harsh operating conditionsby isolating the devices from the environment. However, these techniques are unsuitable for environmental MEMS sensors that require exposure to the environment. Humidity sensors and chemical sensors are two examples of MEMS sensors requiring this exposure.To meet the packaging needs of these devices, new package designs, packaging materials, and packaging techniques arerequired. The first phase of this SBIR effort resulted in package designs based on new materials and packaging techniques that will enhancethe reliability of exposed MEMS sensors. Phase I perfomed materials compatibility studies, developed package designs and concepts, and performed experiments to verify aspects of concept feasibility. The proposed Phase II will develop engineering prototypepackages suitable for environmental testing and screening, as well as result in packaged MEMS sensors exposed to the environment.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop the Intellectual Property (IP) core of a novel image compression / signal decomposition algorithm based on the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). This is a fully parallel, scalable, multi-resolution, and low power implementation of the JPEG2000 DWT engine and is particularly well suited for use in both consumer applications at one end of the spectrum (as in reduced bit-rate web browsing over wireless communications channels as found in the next generation of web enabled cell phones) as well as in high-end commercial applications at the other end of the spectrum (as in non-linear video editing accelerators for the movie industry). This particular implementation is a highly efficient implementation of the DWT transform and makes use of a novel Overlap-State wavelet decomposition algorithm which minimizes memory, I/O and computational requirements. Over the next decade, spiraling consumer demand for fast mobile communication of voice and IP over increasingly integrated terrestrial and satellite based systems plagued by a limited electro-magnetic spectrum allocation necessitates the pursuit and development of better compression algorithms that a visually pleasing at low bit rates. As a consequence of extensive research, transform coding techniques now dominate every single image and video coding scheme proposed to-date. Consequently, efficient software and hardware based transform coding system designs and implementations have become a high priority objective.\n\nIn fact, it is widely accepted that JPEG2000 will become the universally accepted format for digital images and high quality video - whether on the web, cable, over wireless systems, in digital cameras, printers, faxes or remote sensors. With its wavelet based image-coding technology, it offers features previously impossible in JPEG. Compared with the old baseline JPEG, the new JPEG2000 spec poses formidable technology challenges for the myriad of developers and OEM's planning on using it. The new standard uses coding algorithms based on the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) which is fundamentally different from the discrete cosine transform (DCT) JPEG spec. In JPEG2000, the importance of computational and especially memory bottlenecks has clearly increased several fold over the old specification. In fact, various implementations of computationally efficientCE wavelet transforms have been reported in recent years.",

In the past several years, HRR features have been actively studied as a promising means for extracting information of ground moving targets. However, until now, no research has been reported that canclaim exactly  how HRR shall be exploited to achieve the expected performance. Based on our efforts in Phase I, we have identified several bottleneck areas that further study can bring critical breakthroughs in this research. This SBIR Phase II researchaims at maturing the promising developments in Phase I and paving the way for a potential technology transition.We propose to further explore HRR features in a composite format. As there is still no  known single HRR feature that can solve the feature-aided tracking problem, several promising different HRR features are considered to jointly assist tracking. Thereare two individual features in the current composite format, namely, the wavelet domain features and the geometric invariants. They will be used in the different phases of a tracking problem. The wavelet domain features will be the main source to supplythe tracking need for continuously observed targets.

We have exceeded our goal of isotropic resolution at 100 microns by 8x with isotropic resolution at 50 microns. While this spatial resolution provides extraordinary anatomic detail, it results in enormous volumes of data- 1GB/specimen. In this phase II application we address the issues required to deliver these large data sets to the user's desktop via the internet in an efficient, user-friendly fashion. We will lay the groundwork for more extensive use of MR histology for phenotyping the mouse by developing an image database for the ten most critical strains of mice (both male and female specimens) that are currently under study in the National Phenotyping project. The data will be acquired in a standardized fashion and mapped to a standard reference space allowing users to compare any of theses data sets with future data sets from mutant mice in a quantitative, reproducible fashion. We will develop an easily searchable database and interface which will allow the user to select any or all of one or multiple data sets for comparison. We will design plug in modules for Image J, a widely available image display program that will facilitate interaction with these massive image arrays. We will deploy the database, the interface, and the analysis tools making web-based morphologic phenotyping accessible to the broadest possible community. In the second phase of this Phase II effort, we will test the utility of the concept by extending web-based phenotyping to researchers in the Mouse Models of Human Cancer Consortium.",

Phase function willbe measured from 10o to 170o using a 32-channel multiple-anode photomultiplier (PMT) and a diode-pumped green laser at 532 nm wavelength; the sphericity, by measuring the uniformity of the scattered radiation with eight fiber-optic probes with individualPMT detectors spaced around the optical axis; and the particle size and refractive index, by data analysis of the scattering signals.During each flight campaign, the instrument can be used to measure the single-particle phase function and calculate the phase function of the sampled air volume to compare with remote sensing data from satellites or ground-based LIDAR systems. The measuredsphericity will allow droplets to be distinguished from irregular-shaped particles, such as mineral dust, sea salt crystals, etc.The proposed project will lead to the development of a prototype device for bench-top testing and an operational instrument for delivery to the Naval Post-Graduate School's Center for Interdisciplinary Remotely Piloted Aircraft Studies (CIRPAS) inMonterey, California for field trials in their atmospheric research program. The proposed single-particle Multi-angle Light Scattering (MLS) spectrometer will be one of the most advanced aerosol characterization instruments ever developed. The initial application will be for aerosol measurement on-board aircrafts for use inprograms funded by ONR, NASA, NOAA and other federal agencies for global warming and climate research, and their counterparts in Europe and Asia. With modifications, a ground-based instrument can be developed to appeal to the larger community of scientistsinvolved in air pollution and health effect studies funded by EPA, DOE and other federal and state agencies such as the California Air Resources Board. The ground-based instrument will provide the measurement community with capabilities hither-to-foreunavailable, or available only in bulky laboratory prototypes constructed by individual investigators. The instrument will enable the optical characterization of aerosols to go beyond the traditional size analysis by pulse-height to the more sophisticatedangular light-scattering based measurement to determine phase function, shape, refractive index, and particle size.

GPS navigation systems have been put to use for weapon guidance, air and maritime navigation,search and rescue operations, and tracking to name a few. The development crystal oscillators that offer faster warm-up times, utilize lower power, are capable of operating over extended temperature ranges, are lower profile and available at lower cost, isnecessary for the continued advancement of GPS based applications.A directly heated crystal oscillator (DHXO) using a SC cut quartz crystal is considered to meet the design goals of the SBIR topic. A heating element plated directly on to the quartz blank in conjunction with an integrated oven control circuit,substantially reduces both the warm-up time and power consumption. The DHXO has conceptually been shown in Phase I to meet several of the most stringent design goals and criteria, representing a major advance in technology.Phase II of the project will address the need for the development of a domestic source for directly heated quartz crystals that will be utilized to develop working directly heated crystal oscillator prototypes. Phase II will also develop the manufacturingtechniques necessary for large-scale, low cost production of directly heated quartz crystals as well as the oscillators. An oscillator meeting the goals outlined in this SBIR topic is a highly desirable and marketable product. In consideringcommercialization, there seems to be no meaningful distinctions between military and commercial/industrial applications. While military applications tend to require more ruggedized assemblies, with proper mechanical design, there does not need to bephysical differences between the applications. A single product approach will provide cost advantage to both military and commercial users by increasing the available production volumes.Directly heated crystal oscillators (DHXO), offer extremely fast warm-up times and consume much less power, while having reasonable short-term stability, thermal performance and enhanced reliability. For many applications where power is limited, such asbattery operated equipment, the performance achieved using this approach is an order of magnitude better than what is currently available in the market.In addition to the commercial applications for these products, a favorable response from military original equipment manufacturers of missile defense guidance systems, aircraft monitoring, encryption devices, as well as portable communications andsurveillance systems has been received. Many programs such as JSOW, JDAM and GRAM-S SAAAM require oscillator solutions similar to the proposed product. The principal reason being the ability of the new DHXO technology to warm-up in the short time periodnow demanded by such applications.",

        "abstract": "The Armed Forces of the United States have become increasingly dependent upon the use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) for a myriad of functions including precision targeting, navigation, and time synchronization.  The GPS infrastructure permitsseamless integration of GPS functionality to a wide range of devices and weapons systems, providing them with an extremely accurate source of targeting, location and time information.  However, this heavy reliance on GPS as an exclusive source ofinformation carries with it an associated degree of risk.  GPS is no loger a guaranteed navigation or time synchronization source for our deployed forces and weapons systems.  An open market for GPS jamming systems has emerged and as these jamming systemsbecome more developed it stands to reason that they will become an increasing threat to the way in which the US military utilizes GPS and the way the military fights, in general.MSSI, a leader in the field of ultra wideband (UWB) RF technology, proposes to develop a UWB based, RF pseudolite ranging system under this Phase II SBIR.  The short pulse nature of UWB transmissions results in extremely accurate time of flightmeasurements and, accordingly, extremely accurate ranging.  This system will demonstrate the feasibility of UWB pseudolite serving to provide geolocation for ground troops, weapons targeting and other functions in GPS denied environments.An important andunique aspect of MSSI's UWB design approach is the demonstrated ability to simultaneously address radar, communications, and precision positioning applications, all with the same core electronics.  In this fashion, a broad range of unique devices can bedeveloped at low cost leading to many new wireless applications.For example, a multifunction UWB architecture to provide simultaneous communications and ranging could result in products for warehouse tracking and inventory control, for personal communications devices for the elderly, for tactical IFF (identificationfriend or foe) systems for the military, and many others.  Simultaneous UWB communications and radar products would have immediate application to Intelligent Transportation Systems - vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-roadside communications and collisionavoidance; as well as applications for the disabled.It is these dual and triple function architectures which we believe will have a significant impact on the future commercial growth of UWB technology.  Today, there is no other technological solution that can provide a multiple function architecture in asingle, low cost package.MSSI is building upon its proven success in UWB development for the military and Government, by transitioning existing prototype hardware and systems into form factors which can achieve multifunctional performance in a manufacturable and cost effectivemanner.  The steps to be taken include consolidation of existing FPGA and DSP firmware into a custom digital ASIC design, and consolidation of UWB RF electronics into a low cost RFIC (radio frequency integrated circuit) or hybrid.MSSI has also recently assessed the relative importance of Silicon technology to its commercialization plans. While Silicon technology appears to be well suited to future implementations of its UWB technology, it is not necessary for many commercialproducts.As discussed above, a microminiature form factor is needed for certain applications where size, weight and volume requirements demand it.  The high nonrecurring cost of Silicon is justified if the product is well defined and the quantities are largeenough. However, its value in terms of size, weight, power, speed and production cost may not be suitable for all anticipated MSSI commercial applications.  Perhaps more importantly, MSSI does not need Silicon technology for initial product development asits UWB architectures are comprised of readily available components.MSSI thus plans to utilize the most appropriate chipset architecture for emerging commercial UWB and military systems.As previously stated, MSSI's UWB technology may be used in dual and triple function architectures involving combinations of communications, radar and precision positioning.  It is this unique multifunction capability that will enable many new wirelessproducts and services.  Specific market opportunities, including draft license agreements with strategic partners, have already been identified.  Additional opportunities are expected to increase significantly as MSSI becomes active in marketing thetechnology for commercial applications.The wireless marketplace is enormous as consumer demand increases at an unprecedented rate.  This is a huge marketplace in which MSSI's unique, multifunction, high data rate communication/precise positioning capability has obvious potential for high growthand profitability as manufactures seek additional performance capabilities to gain market advantages.For example, MSSI envisions the introduction of a high quality wireless headsets and speakers for home theater, and CD audio use.   Existing wireless RF technologies lack the bandwidth and robustness to deliver full CD quality audio which has become thestandard for the music industry.  Consumers will welcome the ability to retain high quality audio without a tethered wire connection.Another unique UWB device will enable distance sensing from a handheld phone and/or PDA to assist in keeping track of children in crowded environments such as shopping malls, amusement parks, concerts and sporting events.  This device would alert a parentif a child has moved some preset distance from the electronic device.  The device on the child would be small and unobtrusive and could be worn on the wrist or pinned to clothing.In the communications area, there is a demand for high data rate as Internet access increases.  MSSI has identified communications in mobile multipath environments as an application area where UWB has distinct advantages over competing systems. Theseapplications include a broad range of communications for motor vehicles, aircraft and people.MSSI has demonstrated that a UWB system has clear advantages over spread spectrum for geolocation in multipath environments.  These advantages include greater reliability and significantly better accuracy (e.g. 1 foot vs. 10 feet).  MSSI's system is alsoless complex resulting in lower system and installation cost.  An additional advantage of MSSI''''''''s UWB approach is the capability to communicate voice and data over the same wireless system.In summary, real time asset management is an emerging application area that is ripe for UWB introduction.  MSSI has already received considerable interest from large companies for related positioning and communication system developments.  These potentialstrategic partners and the current need for precise location and tracking offer a high volume and high margin product base.",

While researching the Phase I CCT transfer process a modular cabin and interior design partnership was created with RCO engineering. This automotive style cabin technology had cost and comfort that was very attractive and Eclipse Aviation engaged RCO for a prototype development and is negotiating a production selection. Therefore the successful commercial deployment of a part of the technology developed in this SBIR is possible during Phase II when Eclipse reaches production in 2004. Phase III success will be achieved with the production certification of a complete cabin module that has integrated CCTs. Munro & Assoc. will partner with appropriate GA OEMs and retrofitters to self fund a certification effort in parallel with the Phase II R&D. New GA products will be spawned from the commercial success of the CCT product.",

In particular, the prototype developed in Phase II would replace the current version of tempus, a software framework currently being used in support of MDA's Airborne Laser Program for conceptexploration, performance prediction, and verification and validation of subsystems.  Other tempus users include the Boeing Corporation, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Northrop-Grumman, Mission Research Corporation, New Mexico State University,and the University of Rochester.

        "abstract": "This project will significantly improve the accuracy of high cycle fatigue (HCF) life predictions of centrifugal compressors used in small gas turbine engines. This will be done by developing a probabilistic reduced-order model HCF life prediction computercode that captures the random blade mistuning effects present in actual hardware. Mistuning effects can double or triple the stresses of an ideal bladed-disk assembly (one without blade-to-blade geometry and/or material variations). The reduced-ordermodeling technique enables a sufficiently accurate representation of the underlying physics while avoiding the prohibitively long computational times required by direct simulations involving random variables. An existing mistuning code (REDUCE) will beused to determine the vibration frequencies and amplitudes and an existing structural analysis code (ANSYS) will be used to generate the corresponding probabilistic stresses and strains required by the HCF life model. Phase II will also develop models topredict the redistribution of residual stresses induced by three types of surface enhancement processes (SEP) under thermal and probabilistic HCF loading conditions and incorporate these models into the HCF life prediction code. Fatigue life testing of anexisting impeller will be conducted to verify the accuracy of the HCF code.  The traditional life prediction methodologies used in current small turbine engine design processes are seriously compromised by their inability to capture the inherently randombehavior characteristics of bladed disk assemblies due to mistuning. Consequently, either the compressor designs are overly conservative (with concomitant loss in efficiency and weight penalties) or excessive failures occur during operational use. Theprediction of mistuning effects in bladed disk assemblies is therefore of fundamental importance in achieving a robust HCF-resistant design for small gas turbine engines. The development and validation of an advanced and economical tool for theprobabilistic assessment of random mistuning effects is key to effectively accounting for these important effects during the design process, thereby producing more robust, HCF-free high performance engine components. The application of such an advancedlife prediction tool will result in higher performance engines as well as fewer operational component failures due to manufacturing and material property variances. Both military and commercial small engine applications will benefit from the exploitationof this advanced technology. This proposal was recommended by Honeywell Engines & Systems who intend to apply the analysis tool to assist them in the their",

This will perform GPS waveform processing to support both navigation and jammer geolocationfunctions using the software radio architecture The performance of this prototype SGR in supporting the JTRS navigation and timing requirements and acting as a GPS SIGINT sensor will be demonstrated.  In Phase-III, we plan to transition the SGR softwareinto an SCA compliant GPS Waveform for use in JTRS.Currently the JTRS program plans to use a GPS SAASM module to provide navigation and timing information.  This is an expensive additional component and, due to size, weight and power constraints, cannot be embedded into the JTRS Cluster-2 hand-held radios.The SGR approach provides a cost effective, low power solution to implement GPS with the JTRS and has the additional benefit of enhancing GPS protection through the networked software SIGINT function.

        "abstract": "The goal of the Joint Precision Approach and Landing (JPALS) Shipboard Relative GPS Concept SRGPS program is to provide a GPS-based system capable of automatically landing an aircraft on a moving aircraft carrier under all sea and weather conditionsconsidered feasible for shipboard landings. The continuity and quality of the GPS satellite measurements critically drive the overall SRGPS navigation continuity and integrity. Faulty measurements, even if detected prior to transmission, impact systemperformance. Therefore, improvements are needed in the SRGPS shipboard reference station and signal processing to assure the continuity and integrity of the SRGPS correctionsUnder Phase I of this SBIR, a design was developed for a hybrid integrity solution. The integrity solution leverages the capabilities of next generation digital spatial processing and ultra-tightly-coupled (UTC) GPS/inertial integrated military UserEquipment (UE). A design was developed for a spatial environment integrity monitor that operates using digital pre-correlation and post-correlation calibration signals generated by the receiver spatial and signal processing electronics. An integratedGPS/inertial receiver autonomous integrity monitor solution (GI-RAIM) was also developed that allows detection of small error drift rates before the inertial solution can be corrupted. An integrity monitoring function embedded within the Kinematic CarrierPhase Tracking (KCPT) positioning algorithms was also developed. Under this Phase II effort, we will design, build and test an aircraft GPS/inertial digital spatial processing receiver, the HAGR-A, which will be used as a test bed under the Phase II effortfor implementation and testing of these integrity monitoring techniques. The HAGR receiver test bed will provide a platform for the testing of different antenna arrays under evaluation for use in the SRGPS system, as well as new integrity monitoringalgorithms. The modular nature of the GI-RAIM GPS/inertial integrity monitoring algorithm developed under this effort will allow it to be embedded within other manufacturers' existing architectures providing additional signal integrity for military andcommercial integrated systems. The algorithms are designed to be synergistic with existing approaches for integrity monitoring (e.g. AIME) and KCPT precise positioning. Applications exist for the JPALS and SRGPS precision approach and landing systems andfor GPS/inertial guided munitions. Commercial applications also exist for the Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS).",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to develop miniaturized electrospray ionization (or nanospray) emitters that have enhanced durability and sensitivity versus those currently available. Nanospray mass spectrometry has improved detection limits, requires less sample volume, and uses lower flow rates (resulting in reduced consumption of analyte) than conventional electrospray ionization. However, commercial nanospray emitters which use thin gold films are readily destroyed by electrical discharge. An alternative to gold coatings for nanospray emitters employing conductive polyaniline has been developed at the University at Buffalo (UB). Polyaniline coatings exhibit high resistance to destruction by electrical discharge and retain the sensitivity improvements of nanospray over electrospray. The demonstrated superior durability of  polyaniline-coated emitters to current commercial emitters should permit, for the first-time, routine coupling of capillary separations techniques to nanospray. The advantage of such a coupling is that it would permit highly sensitive detection and characterization of biological molecules and drugs directly from complex biological mixtures (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid, blood plasma, etc.). This powerful combination of analytical  technologies will have important implications in detection of protein molecules indicative of disease states (e.g., hemoglobin, prealbumin). The immediate objective here is to demonstrate operational capillary electrophoresis and capillary liquid chromatography coupled to nanospray MS using polyaniline-coated  emitters, and to produce commercially an integrated capillary column-nanospray emitter unit.",

The main contract goal was to improve the toughness of boron carbide armor materials, through the addition of carbon nanotubes.  To reach this goal, NanoLabconducted studies to determine suitable blending and compounding techniques to obtain uniformly dispersed composite powders of nanotubes and boron carbide. After identifying suitable blending techniques, NanoLab was given access to the facilities at theArmy Research Laboratory (ARL).  The facilities at Aberdeen include a plasma pressure compaction unit. This unit, similar to a hot press, allows the rapid consolidation of ceramic powders into a sintered article, such as an armor tile.  With the assistanceof the staff at ARL, NanoLab investigated the processing parameters required to make fully dense boron carbide nanotube composites. Once these parameters were identified, NanoLab used characterization facilities at Boston College and Worcester PolytechnicInstitute to analyze these samples. The analysis revealed that the toughness has been doubled, in comparison to the standard boron carbide.  In addition, the high hardness of boron carbide is preserved. These results are based on indent tests, and samplepreparation for ballistic tests are ongoing. The work undertaken in this program will yield tougher, more damage-resistant ceramic components for applications including armor and industrial products. The significant enhancement of the boron carbidetoughness has immediate applications in blast nozzles and other high wear components that suffer from high brittleness.",

A replacement for sapphire is sought for improved performance in high speed missile applications, and at thesame time, reduce the cost of the windows and domes by a factor of two. High purity fine grained (< 1-5 microns) polycrystalline ceramics with a cubic crystal structure  have the potential to perform better than sapphire, while simultaneously being muchless expensive. Starting from nanopowders, and sintering to a fine-grained dense material offers a possibility of tuning the final grain size in order to simultaneously optimize  optical and mechanical properties. This had not been possible until now dueto the lack of high purity sinterable nanopowders, and a rapid consolidation technique that minimizes grain growth. Overcoming both of these roadblocks,  we demonstrated in Phase I for the first time that high purity   nanopowders of oxide ceramics,synthesized in house by a scalable process can be sintered at relatively low temperatures to full density and a high degree of transparency. Fully dense MgO was synthesized with a final grain size in the 1 - 3 microns range. The peak value of transmissionwas 80% in the midwave infrared region, compared to a theoretical value of 88%. Building upon the Phase I results, we propose to develop the powder synthesis process as well as the consolidation technology to a state of commercial readiness. Working incollaboration with (a) one of the leading corporations that supplies components and systems to the military, (b) a company that specializes in consolidation of transparent ceramics, (c) a unit of the Navy dedicated to developing infrared window and domematerials for heat seeking missiles, and (d) two university groups, we propose to further develop and optimize synthesis of oxide ceramic nanopowders and sintering of 2 - 6",

This device, which also will include a carbon cathode and a non-aqueous electrolyte, will have high rate capabilities with a discharge time as small as 3 minutes, and a charge time as small as 6 minutes for a long cycle life (> 1000).  In Phase I, nanostructured anode materials, with a structure and morphology that are ideally suited for obtaining high performance electrode tapes, were synthesized using the cheapest available chemical precursor.  It was shown that the electrochemical properties can be greatly enhanced by reducing the crystallite size of anode materials.  Phase II will fabricate prototype cells consisting of anodes made of nanocomposite powders with an optimized structure and composition.  The prototype cells will be assembled in 18-39 V modules to evaluate their performance in a battery configuration.  Processing methods will be developed for producing large anode tapes with the nanocomposite powders.      Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  Asymmetric hybrid energy storage devices utilizing nanostructured tungsten oxide anodes should satisfy the emerging needs of propulsion systems for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), where both fast discharge and charge rates are desired.  These batteries also should be well suited for other commercial applications, such as power tools and uninterrupted power supplies.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that nanopowders of MgAl2O4 haveever been synthesized. Sinterable spinel MgAl2O4 nanopowders are needed to fabricate fine grained (micron to sub-micron range) and transparent ceramic objects for use primarily in missile and armor applications. Spinel materials possess certain uniqueoptical properties that are superior to those of the more expensive sapphire, which is currently used. In addition, fine-grained materials have the potential to display excellent mechanical properties. In the proposed Phase II program, the synthesisprocess demonstrated in Phase I will be developed so that we can be a supplier of high quality spinel MgAl2O4 nanopowders for military and commercial applications, with an emphasis on reproducibility. Microstructural evolution during sintering will bestudied, and feedback will be used to optimize the powder properties. Spinel MgAl2O4 powders will be provided to our collaborator, a commercial manufacturer of transparent ceramics, and 4 inch diameter discs will be fabricated and characterized for opticaland mechanical properties. Nanopowders will also be delivered to the Army as required.Transparent ceramics offer a number of opportunities in both military and civilian applications, including infrared windows in missiles and optical systems. The totalmarket for such components is in the several tens of millions of dollars. The nanopowder synthesis process being developed in this program is also suitable for producing high quality doped and multi-component oxides for a variety of functionalapplications, including rechargeable Li-ion batteries, photonic devices and chemical gas sensors.

        "abstract": "70053S02-II     Many nuclear physics experiments supported by the DOE use photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) for the detection of optical signals induced by nuclear particles in detectors.  PMTs are the most sensitive light detectors available and are frequently utilized when single-photon and excellent- timing signal detection are necessary.  However, hand-assembled  PMTs are relatively bulky, expensive vacuum tube devices that haven\u00bft changed significantly in the last few decades. The miniaturization of photomultipliers, from traditional photocathode sizes of approximately 1 cm diameter down to sub-millimeter sizes, would expand the applicability of this light detection technology for both scientific experimentation and commercial utility.  This project will produce sealed and working prototype micro-photomultiplier arrays (MPA).  Phase I modeled and optimized the two-dimensional MPA structure, using electric field calculation and electron trajectory mapping software.  Batch mode semiconductor processes were developed to fabricate parts with micrometer precision.  Microdynode fabrication was accomplished using standard semiconductor process techniques, and a micromachined, fully pixellated dynode structure for producing a micro-photomultiplier array was demonstrated.  Phase II will focus on improved manufacturability, improved dynode assembly, the use of higher secondary-electron-yield coatings, photocathode processing compatibility, adding multi-anode readout capability, and final device packaging and testing.  Forty prototype sealed micro-photomultiplier arrays will be fabricated.     Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The miniature photomultiplier array should significantly change photomultiplier technology and create new applications in medical and biological diagnostic equipment, and in portable and handheld analytical instrumentation.  In addition, photomultiplier technology is a key component of many devices being employed for screening cargo carriers passing through entry ports into the United States.  The micro-photomultiplier array should enable higher quality inspection, faster detector response times, and lower overall system costs.",

The sensor employs an ultrasonic pulsed phase locked loop (P2L2) to measure sub-micrometer changes inmuscle compartment width.  In Phase I, these changes were shown to correlate with changes in intramuscular pressure (IMP).  More significantly, Nascent determined that the P2L2 is sensitive enough to detect arterial pulses in the muscle compartment.  Thissensitivity makes possible more sophisticated diagnostics for compartment syndrome than is now possible with direct measurement of IMP using invasive, catheter-based measurements.In Phase II, Nascent proposes to convert its existing, laboratory-based P2L2 into a portable instrument suitable for use in battlefield care, hospitals, trauma centers, and disaster sites.  This instrument will be tested on human subjects at University ofCalifornia, San Diego School of Medicine.  Additional tests will be conducted at the College of William and Mary's Department of Kinesiology in Williamsburg, Virginia, while Nascent will receive consulting assistance in medical ultrasound technology fromthe Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.

This project plans to complete development of an innovative new optoelectronic sensing method integral to the new technology and then design, construct, and test a near commercial scale prototype metals processing system based upon the new technology. The prototype system will be integrated into an existing pilot plant test facility located on-site at the commercial partner's metals recycling facility and will be tested on metal feed streams derived from an automobile shredder processing line located at the recycling facility. A primary objective is to develop an environmentally friendly computerized dry process which can be situated locally and which can rapidly and cleanly sort aluminum scrap from mixtures of nonmagnetic metals at low cost to replace large, costly, and environmentally burdensome heavy media processes and smelting processes for mixed metals.\n\nThe commercial and broader impacts of this technology will be to reduce the amount of scrap aluminum alloys that are discarded each year in landfills because recycling of these materials are neither technically nor economically practical. Existing methods of sortation use visual examination and hand sortation, or hand-held/bench-top analyzers that are cumbersome and slow in speed. Heavy media separators and smelting facilities for mixed metals are polluting and expensive to build and operate. Using advanced optoelectronic detection techniques, including computer analysis, the proposed technology will sort aluminum alloys from mixed nonferrous metals automatically at speeds never before attainable. If the approach is successful, the impact to increased scrap utilization, increased scrap value and reduced environmental pollution is enormous.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   \nThe goal of breast conservation surgery is local control through complete tumor removal with minimal normal tissue excision. However, in about one-third of lumpectomies, specimen margins contain cancer cells, strongly suggesting the presence of residual cancer in the breast. These residual cells are the presumed etiology of local recurrence, and are typically treated with local therapy (e.g., re-excision or radiation) or systemic therapy. Intraoperative ultrasound has been used to reduce the incidence of positive lumpectomy margins. Since ultrasound does not typically detect in situ cancer (which is associated with positive lumpectomy margins in 40% of cases), intraoperative ultrasound is not likely to completely solve the problem of positive lumpectomy margins. We propose the use of image-guided surgery in which a novel high resolution dedicated breast positron emission tomography (\"PET\") scanner is used to define the location and extent of cancer prior to surgery. Published pilot data suggest that this high performance scanner (2.5 mm full-width half-maximum spatial resolution) can accurately define the size of breast cancers.   \n  \nA prospectively planned controlled clinical trial is proposed, involving 264 women scheduled for lumpectomy who are randomized into two groups of equal size. In the test group, subjects will have high resolution PET scans of the affected breast prior to surgery, with guide wires or markers placed as needed to specify the cancer extent and location. Follow-up reviews of pathology records will determine the fraction of patients with positive lumpectomy margins. Members of the control group of subjects will not receive PET scans, and will have their records reviewed as in the test group. Statistical considerations suggest that we are likely to observe (with 80% power) whether the percentage of patients with lumpectomy margins decreases by a factor of two (i.e. from 30% to 15%) when the results from perioperative PET scans are applied. Matching private funds are already committed for all phases of this SBIR project.",

        "abstract": "An engineering analysis tool (RSX) for fast and accurate calculations of the aerodynamic characteristics of multistage rocket sled vehicles at supersonic through hypersonic Mach numbers has been demonstrated in the Phase I feasibility study. Initialresults show critical shock interactions with important sled components. The proposed Phase II program will result in a rapid computational method to predict these aerodynamic characteristics including effects of the ground plane and reflected shock waves.An integrated analysis system to support the engineering aerodynamic estimates consists of a number of related databases containing expert knowledge, alternate analysis methods, design rules, experimental and computational data, historical documents, andlessons learned.  This system provides easy access to the corporate memory from previous test programs so that the mistakes, successes, and experiences from the past are available to improve future programs. The method helps less experienced engineersaccomplish accurate aerodynamic analyses for future rocket sled tests with guidelines to remind them of the legacy of previous tests.  RSX will increase the accuracy and speed of the aerodynamic analysis process for rocket sleds, reduce the required designmargins for the rocket sled vehicle, and ultimately reduce the risk and cost of future rocket sled tests.",

        "abstract": "A mobile platform is proposed for aquatic in-situ toxicant detection featuring living biosensors.  This platform or BioSensor Suite comprises a sentinel species biosensor, water quality monitoring sensors and a water sampler.  The BioSensor Suite will bedeployable as an integrated sensor package on the Ranger TA (Toxic Alarm), a 10 lb micro-UUV.  The proposed effort will include system design, fabrication, sensor integration, multi-sensor fusion, laboratory and field trials.  The proposed system leveragesPhase I accomplishments and will enable a mobile, man portable aquatic biological early warning system (BEWS) to become a reality.  Multi-agent capabilities being developed in other efforts will enable dynamic retasking of groups of  the proposed platformto rapidly and accurately characterize the extent of a toxicant contamination.  The system will fill applications in military and civilian settings where toxicant conditions are suspected in aquatic settings.The proposed technology will have military andcivilian benefits.  The initial target military application is an early warning system to detect chem/bio contamination of drinking water sources for forward deployed troops prior to filtration by Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Units (ROWPU) andTactical Water Purification Systems (TWPS).  In civilian applications, the technology has applications in homeland defense and environmental monitoring.  Homeland defense applications include monitoring for toxicants in drinking water reservoirs on aperiodic basis or in the event of a suspected asymmetric attack.  Environmental monitoring includes detection and localizing toxicants in public bodies of water, particularly frequently populated beaches.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a degeneratve disorder of the central nervous system that affects between 4-6% of all elderly US residents over the age of 65 with annual associated costs over $100 billion.  Research and development of new treatments is critically dependent on accurate and reliable assessment methods that address multiple cognitive domains. The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale or ADAS was among the first comprehensive cognitive/behavioral batteries designed specifically for Alzheimer's disease assessment and is today the most widely accepted and used in research and clinical trials of new antidementia pharmacologic agents.  The project objective is to develop a computerized version of the ADAS that is equivalent to the standard paper-and-pencil version while conferring the advantages of contemporary information technologies.  The primary advantages of computerization include: standardized presentation, immediate electronic data capture, error-free tabulation and scoring; and storage in a powerful, fully relational database. The computer platform to be utilized is uniquely suited to assessment of the elderly and impaired subjects due to its interactive dual-display and control architecture, which integrates a human examiner.  This enables an examiner to score verbal report and overt behavioral performance (e.g. praxis tasks), otherwise not possible with single display systems. The proposed hardware-software ensemble will include not only a computerized ADAS but also a suite of powerful software utilities to assist implementation and management of clinical trials as well as to comply with recently issued regulatory agency guidelines.  In addition to software development, Phase II will implement a longitudinal comparison of the cADAS with the standard ADAS at two established AD research centers.  The proposed new technology would find application in nearly all clinical trials as well as research and development of new pharmaceutical agents aimed at reducing the cognitive deficits and/or underlying neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a rapidly advancing worldwide epidemic. Within the United States alone, 60% of the population is considered to be overweight. While new treatments for obesity have been introduced in the last decade, these drugs are only capable of reducing body weight by 10%, and patients typically gain back the lost weight following cessation of treatment. The potential for more effective therapeutics may be realized by targeting hormonal systems residing within the hypothalamus, a region of the brain critical for the appropriate regulation of food intake and energy utilization. Melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) is a prominent hormonal system originating within the lateral hypothalamus, which is responsible for initiating food intake. Genetically manipulating the expression of either the MCH ligand, or its receptor, inevitably results in alteration of body weight. Thus, mice overexpressing MCH ligand are obese, while mice lacking either the ligand or the receptor are lean. These data are consistent with the notion that blocking the interaction between MCH and its receptor will provide an effective means by which to reduce food intake in humans, and ultimately cause a loss of body weight. During the first phase of this project, we used high-throughput organic chemistry to develop multiple chemical series of potent MCH antagonists. We have also developed a number of critical in vitro and in vivo assays with which to monitor the bioavailability of these compounds, and their ability to inhibit acute food intake. In the second phase of this project, we propose to further refine these small molecules to improve their bioavailability. This will be accomplished by computer assisted drug design in conjunction with evaluation for a number of biological parameters including receptor affinity, hepatic stability, membrane permeability, and the potential for adverse reactions with liver enzymes necessary for proper drug metabolism. Compounds successfully emerging from this process will be further evaluated in acute and chronic feeding paradigms in order to select candidates suitable for clinical trials.",

Research indicates that in the year 2000, 37 percent of fourth graders were below the \"basic\" level of skill in reading. Some studies have shown that tutoring can be an effective means for improving children's learning, and that students with well-trained tutors learn more than students with untrained tutors. The researchers in this project are designing and implementing eight tutor-training e-courses based on empirically-tested principles of learning and current knowledge in reading education. They are also embedding experiments in three of the eight e-courses to study specific features of student learning. In one experiment, they are comparing the learning of students who have to manipulate colored icons on the screen in a practice task to that of students who simply have to choose an answer. In a second experiment, the researchers are studying the effects of having students construct answers to pretest questions on how well they do in a later test. In the third experiment, the researchers are testing the hypothesis that students who are warned about a pop quiz learn more than students who are not warned. The research team is putting the web-based learning courses into a digital library called CyberSilo to make the training more widely available. The goal of this project is to develop effective methods of learning in distance education, particularly in the area of cost-effective training of tutors.",

Additionally, another 28,000 to 36,000 acutely ruptured aneurysms are treated per year in the U.S. The incidence of an intracranial aneurysm in the general population has been estimated to be between 1.5% to 8%. Current treatment options for cerebral aneurysm fall into two categories: surgical and interventional. Surgical procedures involve a long, delicate operation that has significant risk and a long period of postoperative rehabilitation and critical care. Recently, with the advent of neuro-interventional devices such as the Guglielmi detachable platinum coils (GDCs), a new endovascular modality for the treatment of cerebral aneurysms has become available. Our goal is to develop an endovascularly placed polymer aneurysm filler technology for treatment of aneurysms that is designed to address the shortcomings of interventional aneurysm treatment with platinum coils. We are developing a polymer filler material to be delivered in much the same way that a meallic coil is implanted. We anticipate that a packing density of at least 70% can be achieved.  This substantially greater filling capability combined with the polymeric surface and surface-coating technologies will allow for permanent healing at the neck of the aneurysm.",

        "abstract": "Photonic approaches are attractive for next generation computing and communication systems. Large-scale photonic switch matrix is however difficult to realize because of the limitation of existing switching device architectures and fabricationtechnologies. Typically photonic switch matrix requires N2 cascaded matrix switching elements for N x N non-blocking switching. The large number of switching nodes involved makes the switch matrix suffer from significant crosstalk due to imperfect analogswitching. This limits the matrix size that can be achieved. Using binary switching control can facilitate the formation of large-scale switch matrix. But current technology suffers from slow switching reconfiguration rate. New Span Opto-Technology Inc.proposes a novel photonic switch matrix using all optical control for switch pattern reconfiguration. By minimizing the switching nodes and incorporating binary switching the novel device should minimize the switch crosstalk, improve device throughput, andoffer the simultaneous advantages of large scaling matrix forming capability and fast switch pattern reconfiguration. It further minimizes switch system sensitivity to EMI due to all-optical binary switching. The feasibility of the proposed switch matrixconcept has been successfully demonstrated in Phase I. This Phase II study will optimize the device and realize a large-scale photonic switch matrix for communication and computing applications.",

Seals must withstand both the oxidizing and reducing atmospheres and the thermal cycling that accompany SOFC operation, while remaining both compliant enough to bond well at interfaces and rigid enough to resist creep during use. This project will develop a family of low-cost, composite, compliant seal materials with specially controlled microstructures that can be tailored to the requirements of different SOFC stack designs.  Phase I synthesized a number of different composite materials, fabricated seal gaskets of these materials by tape casting methods, and tested the seal performance of these gaskets at elevated temperatures and under thermal cycling conditions. Performance improvements compared to the state-of-the-art were demonstrated.  Phase II will explore a number of strategies to further improve seal performance, and reduce the cost and utility of these seal materials.

        "abstract": "The proposed study will extend advances made during Phase I in hardware and software design to an existing real-time optical tomography system for the purpose of early breast cancer detection. In preliminary studies we have shown the basic approach ofdynamic optical tomography (DYNOT) exhibits excellent sensitivity to well-known functional disturbances in tumor perfusion and to disturbances in tissue oxygen supply/demand.  These anomalies can serve as the biological markers for the presence ofmalignant tumor growth.  The new system will provide for simultaneous bilateral imaging studies of the breast and incorporate a nonlinear image update scheme developed under Phase I support.  Preliminary studies indicate that the new update scheme isrobust, highly efficient and applicable to a broad spectrum of inverse problems having commercial and military interest.  Specific aims of this Phase II study include integration and testing of new hardware, upgrades to software modules includingadditional testing of the nonlinear scheme and expanded clinical trials to include studies on healthy women, those with benign breast pathology and cancerous tumors. The proposed project builds on the growing success of NIRx to apply time-series opticaltomography for the investigation of functional responses of the vascular bed of tissue for research and clinical studies.  Successful demonstration of the proposed system could result in more rapid and reliable breast cancer screening without the need forexposure to ionizing sources or painful compression.  Significantly, these capabilities can be extended to allow for simultaneous multi-site monitoring of other target tissues (e.g., limbs, head) for which there is a need to assess a differential response.This would serve to expand the overall utility of the imaging technology that continues to gain acceptance as a powerful new functional imaging tool.  The commercial potential of our proprietary technology continues to expand with our increasingdemonstration of its general utility.   Sizable markets (>$10 M) have already been identified for uses in neonatal monitoring, peripheral vascular disease, pharmaceutical evaluation, cerebral vascular monitoring, muscle disorders, and veterinary uses.Adding to this potential is the genuine interest expressed by established strategic partners who seek to aid in our specialized product development.",

        "abstract": "Operating aircraft propellers pose a serious safety threat to aircraft carrier personnel, particularly during low visibility/low light conditions. Potentially distracted by high tempo flight operations, maintenance crews and passengers are inadvertentlystruck each year with tragic consequences.In Phase 1 we addressed the problem through the application of an innovative Low Light Level Illumination (LLLI) material onto the propeller blades, creating a highly effective visual warning indicator. Our LLLI application dramatically improves bladevisibility under all lighting conditions.Phase II will refine the product and application through extensive computer and physical testing to maximize visibility, material adhesion, durability, wear resistance and ease of installation while not compromising propeller aerodynamic performance.Following a detailed process of risk mitigation we intend to field a serviceable, logistically supported product for application on the E-2C propeller. This focused developmental research will provide NAWCAD a highly effective LLLI treatment that enhancespropeller visibility, is affordable, maintenance-free, 100% reliable, and ready for rapid transition onto other propeller and rotor-operated aircraft in the Navy inventory. This problem is not unique to the military as there are a number of similar propeller strike accidents in the commercial and general aviation industry.",

In the Phase II we will develop prototype devices using this material and using microelectronics fabrication techniques that are suitable for massproduction.

The site will provide high quality and comprehensive continuing education for parents in the child care system. These parents are frequently unable to make arrangements to attend training activities, which severely limits the quantity, quality, and relevance of materials available to them. Initial course offerings will include a total of 19 courses in three instructional areas: Dealing with Children's Serious Emotional Problems, Coping with School Issues, and Kinship Care. In Phase I, we completed development for one course on Anger Outbursts. The delivery format reflects a state-of-the-art multimedia presentation that features: a focused introduction to the problem, story narratives from parents about the problem, a question-and-response session with a clinical expert, a synthesis of information, and suggested steps for parent follow-up. In the evaluation study, utilizing a DVD format, we found that parents in the treatment group made highly significant improvements in knowledge as well as changes in parent confidence and perspective regarding Anger Outbursts, compared with parents in the control group. Parents also reported a high degree of user satisfaction with the materials. In Phase l we will develop and produce 18 additional courses. The evaluation study will assess parent gains in knowledge and self-perceptions with a subset of courses from each of the three instructional areas. The site will be promoted throughout an established national network of state and county agencies.",

        "abstract": "The success of remote, unattended ground sensing using a network of distributed sensors often depends on knowing the position and orientation of each sensor. In fact, sensor localization is a critical enabling technology for Networked Sensors for theObjective Force. However, in many sensor deployments, accurate knowledge of sensor locations and orientations is unavailable. We propose to demonstrate a prototype sensor network incorporating the innovative techniques for sensor self-locating andself-orienting that are being developed in the PODIS Phase I research. These techniques use acoustic signals to determine at each sensor the relative range and bearing of calibration sources; this information is fused at a central node with a minimalamount of prior location information to compute the locations and orientations of all sensors, as well as estimates of the calibration accuracy. Significantly, the source signals may be at unknown locations, and need not be collocated with sensors.  Usingacoustic and digital signal processing elements and an advanced sensor radio network, we will demonstrate the ability to self-calibrate a network of sensors separated by 30-500 meters in typical outdoor environments.The sensor self-localization system that will be developed in the Phase II PODIS implementation will be a robust, self-contained system for autonomous localization and orientation. PODIS technology enables location-aware applications for sensing networkscritical to the warfighter in areas where other sensing assets are blind or denied. The PODIS calibration is essential for providing accurate tracking and targeting information with low-cost, quickly deployed sensor networks. Self-calibrating sensornetworks show promise in many commercial applications such as ocean search and rescue, locating victims in burning buildings or forests, providing distributed sensing of large public areas for homeland security, and developing smart houses.",

        "abstract": "Direct-conversion, position-sensitive x-ray detectors are needed in many important technologies such as medical and industrial imaging, nondestructive inspection (NDI) and evaluation (NDE), munitions monitoring, and baggage scanning. Advanced x-ray imagingtechniques can register both shape and spectral information by measuring the attenuation of multi-energetic x-rays through the imaged specimen. The density and composition data thus acquired can enable machine recognition of materials, a capability thatwould be useful for several military and industrial applications. Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) has emerged as the detector material of choice forhyperspectral imaging because it works at room temperature with excellent energy resolution and has a large atomic number, which is essential for high-sensitivity detection of x-rays. High count rate uniformity and maxima of two million or more counts perpixel per second have recently been achieved in CZT using a new lineararray design and a custom readout system for ultra-fast hyperspectral line scanning. Further innovation building upon these developments would be desirable, in particular by designing and fabricating a high-throughput hyperspectral imaging system operatingin the alternative staring-array imaging mode which would be useful in static as well as conveyor-belt type inspection applications. A very concrete need presently exists for such a system in the manufacture of munitions, specifically in inspection andprocess control operations which cannot be adequately monitored using currenttechnologies.  In response to this, we propose to develop a new x-ray radiographic system consisting of a monolithic two-dimensional, submillimeter resolution pixilated array CZT detector and the corresponding custom readout ASIC (Application SpecificIntegrated Circuit) and support electronics, which would have multiple x-ray energy imaging and high counting rate capability.The result of the proposed work will be a large, pixilated high-throughput, high-accuracy room-temperature and polarization freehyperspectral 2D x-ray imaging detector system with a custom made monolithic readout electronics chip to handle large amounts of data in real time. It will be able to perform hyperspectral, staring-array imaging in milliseconds using high flux output x-raygenerators.  This detector has many application capabilities for both the military and commercial sectors, such as immediate discernment of material composition for defects and anomalies at production rates in all kinds of products including propellantsand explosives, as well as identifying material in security screening applications and medical imaging such as fast response bone densitometry.  DoD applications include all standard x-ray and gamma ray inspection techniques at high speeds withhyperspectral imaging capability which is just evolving.  For example, some of the applications are: NDI of munitions, Compton detectors for detection and monitoring ofradioactive material, inspection of containers, and contraband detection.  CdZnTe detector can be especially useful in battlefields due to their compact nature and room temperature operation especially for radioactivity detection and imaging. Non-DoDapplications are even more extensive given the wider variety of objects requiring inspection in many different types of industrial situations. Our work will give special attention to the munitions inspection application which has specific and criticalprocess control needs.",

Phase I results also indicated that the soil block test could not quantitatively differentiate the merits of the various wood preserving functions built into the polybiguanide compounds since many of the compounds used showed no decay for the 12-week period of the test. The Phase II study builds on the compounds developed in Phase I, and includes new compositions that incorporate additional functions to afford further wood preserving functions. The specific aims of Phase II are: Aim 1. To synthesize 15 PBG compounds based on Phase I results; Aim 2.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):\nThe purpose of this study is to conduct a Phase II clinical trial in patients\nwith incurable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our aim is to induce antitumor\nimmune responses by immunizing patients with an experimental vaccine\ncomprised of four allogeneic NSCLC cell lines genetically modified with a TGFbeta\n2 antisense vector. By blocking secretion of the immunosuppressive\nmolecule TGF-beta in this manner we inhibit one of the major mechanisms by\nwhich tumor cells evade immune surveillance.\nDeveloping an effective therapy for the disease that accounts for 30 percent\nof all cancer-related deaths will benefit the approximately 180,000 new\npatients that develop lung cancer in the United States each year. In a\nprevious clinical trial, we have shown that injections with gene-modified\nallogeneic tumor cells induced cellular immune responses to autologous tumor\ncells. In this trial, 18 patients will be randomized into three cohorts that\nwill receive 1.25 x 10exp7, 2.5 x 10exp7, or 5 x 10exp7 TGF-beta antisensemodified\nvaccine cells. Following completion of this phase of the trial, an\nadditional 48 patients will be enrolled in the two cohorts that demonstrate\nthe best clinical responses. We anticipate that our treatment will induce\nmeasurable clinical responses in some of the treated patients.\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS:\nThe potential patient pool for this study is 180,000 patients annually in the United States.  When considering other parts of the world, the potential patient pool is significantly larger. Once the Phase II clinical trial is completed, and the efficacy of our method is proved, we will perform the subsequent phases of our clinical trial phases, as well as the commercialization of our method in partnership with a pharmaceutical company that has the facility to mass produce and market our vaccine.",

The work will lead to the introduction of improved feedback systems into nanopositioner design,providing the opportunity for higher speeds, more reliable performance, and greater user friendliness. The work will lead to nanopositioners with a high degree of thermal stability.The Phase II effort will serve as a foundation for follow-on research and development as summarize briefly:It is clear that our work will enable much of nanoscience research as it progresses from the initial gee-whiz experiments to more advanced implementations. In that sense it serves as a follow-on to much research outside of nPoint. In terms of follow-onwork within nPoint the present effort will potentially lead us beyond the vision of component maker to the larger vision of integrated tools and instruments, and to an expansion to other product lines. We are already setting out to develop a retrofit kitfor AFMs that will allow true and absolute metrological measurements on the AFM. We could in the future move beyond that to complete systems, such as nanoprecision machining tools, metrology tools, writing tools, and manipulation tools. In addition thereare opportunities in test instrumentation (e.g., for the data storage industry). Ultimately, with our new materials, we expect to enable technology in areas, such as ultrafine electron beam lithography, where eddy currents in metal stages cause beamdistortion, or other applications for which metals are inappropriate.All of our discussion has been in terms of linear motions. But there is significant opportunity in high-precision angular motion, e.g., piezo-driven linear to rotary motion transducers. The work we will do on electronics and feedback will be valuable inthis enterprise, as well as improvements in mechano-thermal loops that we will make.The success of this Phase II effort will impact future developments at nPoint:The work will enable the work outlined in Sec. 3 and through that will drive future revenues for nPoint.The work will enhance military applications in IR sensing and laser guidance.The work will have potential spin-off products in capacitance sensors and other areas, such as complete systems or subsystems rather than components we now supply to OEM customers.The work will allow CD metrology to advance significantly in terms of speed, and combined with our probe development, in resolution.",

This system utilizes projection optics in a head-mounted configuration, referred to as a Head-Mounted Projective Display, or HMPD. The HMPD is a lightweightdisplay that projects images onto a thin retro-reflective screen that can be placed virtually anywhere in the surrounding environment.  Images are reflected back towards the user, independent of the viewing angle between the screen and the user.Unlike most head-mounted displays, the HMPD is inherently see-through, with the augmented images only appearing where the retro-reflective screen is present, such as on a physical window or opening.  This provides the user with the correct cutoff betweenthe real environment and the OTW scene.  All other areas of the physical environment will be visible through the display optics.  This will allow users to operate the vehicle controls that would be instrumented to the deployed image generator.NVIS will develop the HMPD to attach to standard military flight gear using off-the-shelf hardware, similar to a night vision goggle attachment. The retro-reflective screen can be placed virtually anywhere in the environment, allowing the HMPD concept tobe adapted easily for both ground and air vehicles.The head-mounted projective display (HMPD) is a generalized display concept that will have far-reaching benefits for military and commercial applications.

However, their output volume is more than the local operator / analyst can manage. Consequently, this data is reportedto remote analysis sites for further processing and analysis. Any derived intelligence is reported back to the sensors and other interested parties some time later.   The purpose of this SBIR is to a) complement a new back end processing capability calledCMASS (Cryptologic Management and Analysis Subsystem (or Software Segments), b) provide a means of actually extracting intelligence from the data the sensor node collects and do this automatically and locally (at the sensor).  We will demonstrate thesecapabilities, as we progress at several points during Phase II and will attempt to apply these capabilities to high priority data.  The success of this effort will have significant positive impact on manning, training, communications bandwidth but mostimportantly on timeliness of intelligence.  Operationally, the benefits of this SBIR will positively influence Indications & Warnings, Force Protection and Speed of Command. The products of this SBIR will directly transition into Shipboard Cryptologic/IWsystems but will have application to a broader user community.  The primary benefit / application is for CMASS, the Government transition system for SSP AIE products.  Because of this, SSP AIE will eventually migrate to CUB / GCCS-M, making SSP AIEsegments available to DII COE compliant SIGINT systems beyond just the surface Navy.  All of these systems have a need for producing tactical actionable intelligence from the data they collect.  The SSP AIE database centric approach, the use of data miningtools, defined rules for actionable intelligence and MCA standards compliance is totally consistent with the needs of these maritime systems.The process of automated target identification and intelligence extraction via SSP and AIE software could be used for Homeland defense applications, by the USCG, by Government intelligence agencies, by border patrol agencies and by other law enforcementagencies.",

VLSI provides fast intrinsic signal speeds but these speeds cannot be supported by electricalinterconnects between other chips on the same board. Conversion to optical interconnects at the intra-board level can overcome these limits. The practical limits of optical interconnects arises from the optoelectronic transmitters and receivers, whichcurrently have bandwidths up to 10GHZ. The emerging 40-GHz OC-768 telecommunications standard is a strong indication that optical interconnects will keep pace with VLSI for many years. However, their cost-effective assimilation into conventionaltechnologies remains the major unresolved issue. Therefore, we propose an optoelectronic board-level bus employing a fully imbedded optical interconnection layer based on polymeric waveguides, thin-film vertical-cavity-surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) andthin-film metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) photodetectors, integrated onto a PCB structure and planarized to allow conventional integration of noncritical electrical interconnects. Optical couplers will couple light between the transceivers and the chipsmounted on the boards's surface. By demonstrating these integrations we will prove the practicality of high speed board-level optical interconnects, which should lead to Phase III commercialization.",

The achievement of this research can be applied to existing antennas, improving the performance ofcommunication systems, such as satellite-to-satellite communications, remote sensing and ground-based wireless communications. At the component level, the optical switches and WDMs are very attractive fundamental building blocks for metropolitan areanetworks, which have potential for government and private sector applications.

        "abstract": "70518S02-II    High pulsed radio frequency (RF) power, needed for a future electron-positron collider such as NLC, will require RF pulse compression, for which a number of approaches are currently under study.  Active RF pulse compression can, in principal, provide greater flexibility in compressor design than passive compression, because higher compression ratios at higher efficiency can be achieved.  This project will develop a plasma switch for an active SLED-II RF pulse compressor with a compression ratio greater than 8:1 and efficiency greater than 75%.  The plasma switches will be used with resonance structures having a reflection coefficient that can be rapidly shifted during the RF pulse from a klystron.  Changing both the reflection coefficient of the switch and the phase of the klystron output will allow high compression ratios with high efficiency.  In Phase I, three versions of an X-band resonance structure were designed to couple RF power from a klystron into a pair of delay lines and thence, upon switching, into an accelerator structure.  Low-power cold tests were conducted, and, for one version, 70 ns RF pulses were produced with power gains up to 15:1.  Improved plasma switch tube concepts were developed for implementation during Phase II, to allow operation at peak power levels exceeding 400 MW, with good pulse-to-pulse reproducibility.  In Phase II, engineering designs for the RF structures and associated plasma switches will be completed, and plasma discharge tubes of both quartz and ceramic will be evaluated.  Optimized plasma switches will be built and installed on the SLAC dual-mode X-band resonant delay lines for testing at high power, with the aim of producing 400 ns RF pulses with peak power >400 MW and efficiency >75%.   Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The RF plasma switches should be suitable for use in a future electron-positron collider such as the NLC.  Thousands of these switches would be required, constituting a potential market of several tens of millions of dollars.  Other markets for such switches could exist in advanced radar systems.",

Thermal power handling of the lasing elements is a design parameter that has been addressed byreducing their thickness.  Composite slabs consisting of doped and undoped layers and components offer a design option that enables scaling up to high power by increasing the slab dimensions while maintaining a thin central lasing layer.  Composite slabs,consisting of a doped layer such as Yb:YAG or Nd:YAG with undoped YAG ends, sandwiched or clad with sapphire, represent a geometry that simultaneously allows scaling to larger dimensions of thin lasing layers, guiding pump light into the YAG layer due tothe refractive index difference between YAG and sapphire, and providing mechanically strong outer sapphire layers of high thermal conductivity.The proposed Phase II effort will establish YAG/ sapphire composite slabs as new class of engineered materials for high power solid state lasers with known production parameters and laser properties.  An important overall aspect of the manufacturing effortis to reduce the delivery risk when designing a weapons system relying on superior lasing behavior of novel YAG/sapphire composites as laser slabs.  The work will focus on interactions between YAG and sapphire as they are relevant for for increasingmanufacturing yield, and reducing costs and delivery times to enable the laser manufacturer to more quickly complete the prototyping stage.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   \nThe maturation of molecular imaging of cancers emphasizes the high tumor tissue ratios above ten which, when approved by FDA, are expected to revolutionize the sensitivity/specificity of, for example, breast and prostate cancer detection. The development of molecular beacons from collaborating laboratories has provided the two key types of beacons, one being the affinity binding, for example somatostatin, LDL, folate and the stealth or silent beacons (Cathepsin B, etc.) that depend upon recognition and unmasking of the fluorochrome attached to the beacon. Most recently, a fluorescent glucose generally applicable to all rapidly growing cancers has incorporated a NIR fluorochrome. While the NADH and flavoprotein signals are the gold standard of recognition of cancer by the greater glycolytic flow and enhanced reduction state of the tumor, these markers can be greatly enhanced by multi-photon technologies. In addition, the time shared wavelengths characteristically include reflectance spectophotometry of deoxy and total hemoglobin affording a direct links to hypermetabolism and angiogenesis. However, the most important aspect of the technology is its 3-D capability since ice crystal formation which characterizes the freeze trap state, impedes penetration of light through the highly scattering crystal matrix is very limited and fluorescent signals deeper than tens of microns do not interfere with planar images. Finally, fiber optic technology will permit reduction of the size of the voxel from 50 x 50 x 10 to 30 x 30 x 10 mu or even smaller depending upon the light guide construction. As a result of Phase I funding, a greatly improved, simplified and more economical design of the 3-D light pen imager has been completed. A vastly improved system which employs a time multiplex LED source system and silicon diode detector system which will permit a much greater throughput because of the increased duty cycle from roughly 20% to 75%. The operation is automatic and its authenticity is validated by the experiments carried out under Phase I support. Finally, a timetable and milestone exhibit assures production of the second phase model within 8 months at the funding of Phase II and exhaustive validation tests and tech transfer to occur in the remaining 16 months of the Phase II study.",

However, the commercial microporous plastic polymer separators used in these batteries are too expensive and are very limited in their ability to provide these needed performance improvements.  This project will develop nanoporous sol gel coatings as a new type of separator that can be coated from a water-based solution at less than one-half the cost per square meter of commercial plastic separators.  The non-flammable, ionic, and ultra-thin properties of the sol gel separators would allow major improvements in the safety, recharging and discharging speeds, lifetime, and energy density of lithium-based batteries.  In Phase I, tough but very flexible 8-micron-thick sol gel separators were made and showed porosities of 45%.  A manufacturing process, which involved sol gel coating on a smooth substrate and then delaminating the coating from the substrate to form a free standing sol gel separator, was demonstrated.  In Phase II, the mechanical properties of the 8-micron-thick sol gel separators will be optimized by determining the amount and type of crosslinked polymers to add.  The interfacial surfaces between the sol gel separator and the anode and cathode layers will be designed and tested, first in lithium-ion batteries and then in lithium-sulfur batteries.  8-micron-thick sol gel separators will be made on machine coating equipment using a low cost coating/delamination process.     Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  Besides providing separators for lithium-based batteries for vehicles, sol gel separators could be used for other battery applications such as mobile computers and cell phones, as separator membranes for fuel cells, as ultrafiltration membranes for purifying water, as dye-sensitized sol gel coatings for solar splitting of water or methanol to produce hydrogen fuel, and as photo-quality ink jet digital printing materials.",

        "abstract": "Under the Phase-I program, OKSI has demonstrated a simple solution for a continuously variable aperture cold stop for IR cameras.  The variable cold stop was shown to work very smoothly and reliably at liquid nitrogen temperatures in vacuum, in a standardpour-fill dewar.Under Phase-II, OKSI will add into the dewar a focal plane array and camera electronics, and will develop a cold stop control software as an automatic brightness control for image capture with the camera.In parallel, OKSI will also adapt the design to closed cycle hermetically sealed dewars in use with Stirling engines for tactical applications.  A SADA type dewar will be used for the development of a fully functional prototype demonstrating the conceptsof both a dual aperture and a variable aperture cold stop in such tactical dewars.The advantage of using a variable aperture cold stop to the DoD is that the same IR optical system can be used for both wide field search and automated target recognition, and long range target identification without compromising optimal image quality ofeither task.  Thus, this system reduces  the number of types of cameras which need to be inventoried.  In addition, automatic brightness control can be used for high dynamic range scene imaging, greatly reducing  camera saturation. Saturation may be aproblem when viewing a battle field when firing weapons, etc.Two devices are developed under this program, one is for a pour-fill dewar camera and the other for Stirling engine cooled cameras.  The former has applications in laboratory and researchenvironments, while the latter has applications in tactical systems.  On the commercial side, OKSI is already working with a commercial partner, a domestic IR camera manufacturer, that has expressed interest in testing the technology.  In addition, the DoDwill most likely become a significant user for the technology.  For these tactical applications, OKSI will license the technology to vendors producing IR equipment for the DoD.The technology of CVA/CS for IR cameras, for use in various science, technology & intelligence missions such as target signature acquisition, also supports the mission of a number of DoD branches and agencies including Army SMDC, MSIC, MDA, ISTEF, AFRL,etc.",

        "abstract": "Several video-based autonomous navigation algorithms were developed under Phase-I with increasing degree of accuracy.  A flight sensor package was assembled, containing a video camera, a thermal infrared camera, GPS, an Attitude and Heading ReferenceSystems, and other sensors, and flown over urban and agricultural terrain in California.  Ikonos satellite imagery for the same areas were obtained.  An automated video-to-satellite image registration technique was demonstrated, capable of extractingaircraft position (longitude, latitude, and altitude) and orientation (roll, pitch and yaw).  During Phase-I the data analysis was implemented post flight.The Phase-II objectives are: (i) to design and assemble a small embedded microprocessor system, using modular low cost commercial components, capable of executing the navigation algorithm in real time, (ii)to further improve the accuracy of the navigationalgorithms, (iii) to tests and demonstrate the system's real-time navigation ability on a manned aircraft, and (iv) to design a custom embedded microprocessor system that meets the weight, size, and power constraints of a SWARM-class UAV, capable ofmanaging all platform functions including navigation, communications, and housekeeping functions.  This system will transition the technology to the Navy's SWARM project and will serve as the primary intelligent processor for managing the UAV activitiesand functions.   The basis to the video-based autonomous navigation is the ability to extract aircraft position and attitude parameters.  These critical parameters are needed for orthorectification, and georegistration of aerial imagery.  OKSI is involvedin aerial multi- and hyper-spectral remote sensing operations for precision farming.  Precision farming is based on site-specific application of chemicals when and where needed and at the correct amount.  The data products produced by OKSI are used by thefarmers for variable rate applications of chemicals to their crops.  Data production requires that the remote sensing imagery is accurate to within a single pixel.  The algorithms developed under the present ONR SBIR are already helping OKSI to improve itsdata accuracy, and to eliminate an intensive manual effort of georegistering the remote sensing imagery.  Full automation of remote sensing data production will reduce the cost of the products and allow to expand precision farming operations to a widercustomer base.",

This ruggedized system isdesigned to monitor PM down stream from the augmenter tube in the Navy's T-10 Test Cell.  Our technique is intended as a replacement for EPA Method 5 which recommends a sampling approach employing a glass fiber filter and microbalance.  Method 5 isspecified for stationary sources and is characterized by long integration times and poor repeatability, making it a poor candidate for this application.  Our approach provides size distribution and concentration information near real time in a non-contactconfiguration, making it an ideal sensor for PM exiting a jet turbine engine Anticipated benefits of the proposed system include its rapid response time, non-contact configuration, and potentially more accurate algorithmic technique for extracting sizedistribution and concentration information from the measured scatter pattern.  Aside form the jet engine test cell application, likely uses of the proposed technology include the monitoring of diesel exhaust from trucks and off-road equipment in the UnitedStates and passenger cars in Europe.

(UNREP).  During the Phase I program, Orbital Research has: identified the functional requirements of automation to necessary to perform this task; developed a notional series of automated equipment to move cargo aboard aircraftcarriers during automated replenishment operations, and implemented a hybrid continuous time / discrete event simulation suitable for evaluating a number of different materials handling system configurations and options to determine the most applicablesystem for cargo handling during both UNREP and normal operations.  These autonomous materials handling units are controlled using a version of the Orbital Research Unified Control Solution, which allows the integration of both low-level and high-leveltask coordination and management.  The Phase II program will build upon the foundation laid by the Phase I program to further refine the design of these system components.  Then Orbital Research will fabricate a scale-model hardware to demonstrationspecific critical system capabilities to reduce overall program risk and lay the foundation for a Phase III transition.BENEFITS: The Orbital Research Unified Control Solution is a readily adaptable design giving it diverse commercial applications.Commercial applications include: handling heavy payloads in difficult environments such as heavy manufacturing facility automation, metal forming operations, large component assembly processes, high speed flexible manufacturing for large scale components,and underway ship automation.",

Unfortunately, blind people have been left behind by the revolution due to the lack of efficient, low-cost display systems. Existing commercial Braille Displays utilize piezoelectric actuators to deploy mechanical pins, which form Braille text. In order to reduce the cost of Braille Displays, a fresh approach is necessary. Orbital Research has developed a pneumatically actuated Braille Display concept that utilizes low-cost, small, and efficient MEMS microvalves. The microvalves are used to control air pressure delivered to each Braille dot to control deployment. During the Phase I program, Orbital Research successfully demonstrated two separate methods for producing a robust refreshable Braille Display surface and determined the feasibility of integrating cursor routing directly into the Braille surface itself, thereby enhancing the utility of the display while limiting cost increase. For the Phase II, Orbital Research will build on the foundation laid by the Phase I to develop a modular, pneumatic Braille surface that will enable multiple Braille modules and surfaces to be linked together to form any arbitrarily sized Braille Display. These Braille modules will integrate cursor routing techniques to enable the reader to rapidly move the cursor to any specific location they are reading.",

        "abstract": "Current maneuvering technology on Army's FCS munitions utilizes conventional hinge-based flight control surfaces for control and stability. These systems impose substantial weight, volume, and power requirements and ultimately reduce projectile aerodynamicperformance and payload capacity.  The mail goal of the Phase II program is to develop and test a prototype of a Compact Deployable Aero Controls (CODAC)-based Aerodynamic Flight Control System (AFCS), which builds upon successful Phase I feasibilitystudies for enhanced range and control authority for FCS multi-role munitions.  During this program, the key innovation is the combination of CODAC, aero control fins and body extensions to provide extended range and three-axes control (pitch, yaw, androll) to the projectiles.  In addition, the developed CODAC will readily integrate with MEMS actuators for a cost, weight, and power efficient aero-control system.  A successful culmination of the Phase II program will result in significant advances overexisting conventional hinged control surfaces that occupy more space and volume than the proposed AFCS concept.  The ultimate manifestation of this technology is the seamless integration of an AFCS with any multi-role armament munitions in the Army'sFCS.Immediate beneficiaries of proposed AFCS technology will be the Department of Defense.  The proposed AFCS technology can be applied to a multitude of munitions and sub-munitions for extended range and enhanced maneuverability.  For commercialapplication, the proposed CODAC-based AFCS and AFCS- variants may be employed on civil aircrafts for increasing their aerodynamic efficiency via reduced drag and increased lift.  The proposed AFCS can also be used in other aerodynamic applications, groundvehicle applications, and turbomachinery.",

Research at Oregon Soil Corporation and their academic partners at the Ohio State University has shown that organic wastes can be broken down into valuable soil amendments or plant growth media, called vermicomposts, by earthworms using a range of technologies. Vermicomposts have dramatic effects on rates of plant germination, growth, flowering and fruiting. Recent research at OSU has indicated that vermicomposts can suppress the incidence of arthropod pests, plant diseases and plant parasitic nematodes, and that weed seeds and human pathogens are eliminated during vermicomposting. The objectives are: To assess the degree and extent of suppression of plant diseases, plant parasitic nematode populations and arthropod pest numbers, on horticultural crops, by vermicomposts in the laboratory and greenhouse. To assess the degree and extent of suppression of plant diseases, plant parasitic nematode populations, and arthropod pest numbers, on horticultural crops, by vermicomposts in the field. To determine the fate of weed seeds in food wastes and biosolids during vermicomposting. To assess the degree and timing of suppression of human pathogens in food wastes and biosolids during vermicomposting. If wide-spread and significant suppression of plant pests and diseases by vermicomposts and reductions of human pathogens and weed seeds can be achieved by vermicomposting, this would provide a major boost to marketing vermicomposts and ensure their general public and horticultural acceptance.",

Environmental monitoring of potentially harmful chemicals and by-products has also driven the development of new assays. Convenient cell based systems for testing a wide variety of products with a variety of cell types has become a great need. In Phase I, we proposed the development of a system providing ready to use cells on microtiter plates for any desirable assay. We demonstrated that bovine corneal endothelial cells (BCE) attached to tissue culture plastic or an extracellular matrix can be cryopreserved and be viable after thawing. We have also shown that we are able to uniformly cool and warm microtiter plates and improve overall retention of cells to their substrate. The goal of the Phase II proposal, is to further define and optimize the parameters that will provide successful cryopreservation of BCE cells attached to microtiter plates. It was shown that cells attached to an extracellular matrix demonstrated better viability after cryopreservation than cells attached to tissue culture plastic. Further examination of extracellular matrix components will be performed to determine if adjustments to the composition of the matrix can improve viability and attachment. In addition other cryobiological variables will be evaluated including optimization of cooling, the choice of cryoprotectant vehicle solution and its influence on cell survival as well as long term storage of cells after cryopreservation on microtiter plates. All these experiments are designed to further optimize the system and provide cells on plates that are ready to use for a variety of applications. Validation of cryopreserved BCE cells will be provided by a battery of functional assays including, but not limited to, responses to toxicants, extracellular matrix formation, barrier function and nitric oxide production. It is anticipated that optimization of procedures for corneal endothelial cells will provide a technology platform that can be applied, with further development, to other cell types.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The recent and impending approval of monoclonal antibodies for therapeutic application challenges the capacity of conventional cell culture-based production systems to deliver adequate amount of these proteins. Origen Therapeutics' embryonic stem cell-mediated transgenesis technology offers an alternative production system. The protein can be specifically expressed in the oviduct and deposited into egg white. Large quantities of protein can be easily purified from egg white in a timely fashion. The aim of this research is to develop an oviduct-specific expression system for the ultimate goal of producing pharmaceutical proteins including monoclonal antibodies in eggs of transgenic chickens using Origen Theapeutics' technology. Specifically, monoclonal antibody expression vectors with regulatory sequences of the ovalbumin gene will be introduced into chicken ES cells for making high-grade chimeras and transgenic chickens that deposit monoclonal antibodies in egg white. The expression of the transgene will be determined in terms of tissue specificity and the levels of protein deposited in eggs. Methods for purification of monoclonal antibodies from eggs will be developed. The purified proteins will be subjected to detailed analysis to characterize posttranslational modification and biological activity. The end point of this research is a truly tissue-specific and yet high yield expression system that facilitates production of new pharmaceutical proteins. The system is scalable, rapid and will produce proteins with minimum expense.",

We are developing a universal recipient that contributes minimally, so that the contribution of donor derived cells to the resulting chimera is constantly high and predictable.  These high-grade chimeras can be used to produce biopharmaceutical proteins in chicken eggs as soon as the chimeras commence laying and before they transmit the gene encoding the biopharmaceutical protein to the next generation. In addition, these high-grade chimeras will allow the production of biopharmaceutical proteins if the transgene interferes with their ability to reproduce.  The end point of this research is a robust system to produce high-grade chimeras in highly predictable way. Using this system biopharmaceutical proteins can be produced quickly, in a scalable system and at minimal cost.",

New adaptivealgorithms were developed by ORINCON during Phase I that are effective on simulated data for this nonstationary problem - rejecting multiple loud moving interferers while simultaneously improving signal matching for a quiet moving target. Our approachinvolved analysis and simulation of structured scenarios of increasing complexity to isolate specific effects and provide insight and understanding. Performance gains were quantified. The most surprising result was that two to three snapshots perinterferer are adequate to calculate adaptive weights and that post beamformer tracking is just as good as a further increase in the number of snapshots. During Phase II, the algorithms developed in Phase I will be demonstrated and tuned on Robust PassiveSonar (RPS) sea test data using a new real-time or near-real-time implementation. A subsequent Phase III transition of a real-time version of our algorithms to the Navy via the Advanced Process Build (APB) program for at-sea testing is planned.

        "abstract": "A crucial factor in sonar design is the benefit available from increased aperture.  Current sonobuoys have been constrained to the A-size configuration.  Development of the ADAR system has been a significant success in packaging and deployment of such acomplex sensor in the small A-size format.  With the Next Generation ADAR, we propose to increase the physical aperture and add a vertical component, while maintaining as much of the original ADAR design as practical.  The Next Generation ADAR apertureoffers significant horizontal ABF gain without the burden of long integration times needed by long horizontal apertures.  Its vertical aperture offers the added rejection of vertical components of the noise (including reverberation).  The increasedaperture over the existing standard ADAR allows processing at lower frequencies to take advantage of improved propagation.  Thus, the Next Generation ADAR can provide significant passive and active performance in the littoral regions of the world.  DuringPhase I, ORINCON demonstrated this improved performance through simulation.  For Phase II, two prototype Next Generation ADAR units will be assembled and tested at sea.  A third prototype will be assembled for addressing the mechanical aspects of thearray.  In Phase III, the Next Generation ADAR will be taken to a production configuration and qualified for deployment by aircraft, surface ships, and submarines. Through the increased detection performance of the Next Generation ADAR, the Navy will offset reductions in the number of available assets and again be able to offer undersea superiority against a modern, quiet diesel-electric or air-independentpropulsion (AIP) submarine threat to our naval forces in the littoral regions of the world.",

The MTP techniques are knowledge-aided approaches that exploit new generations ofhigh-spatial-resolution geospatial databases, such as DTED, LULC and RF bistatic backscatter characterization tables. The MTP approach was first successfully demonstrated by passively intercepting signals (including their interactions with surroundingterrain) from a ground-based emitter, to geolocate the emitter using a single airborne platform (normally requiring multiple platforms).During the Phase I effort, we successfully demonstrated a proof-of-concept complementary MTP approach that featured an active radar collection platform in which backscattered signals returning from the a passive low-flying aircraft and the surroundingterrain were successfully used to estimate the height of the low-flying target (normally unable to estimate due to the broad elevational beam-pattern of the collection aircraft antenna).As part of a Phase II effort, we propose to increase the dimensionality of the kinematic estimation beyond that of the one-dimensional estimation of height, to enhance the fidelity of the signal environment and estimation, thereby improve the estimationaccuracy.  Robustness will be tested with a variety of collection scenarios and culminating with a fast implementation of the MTP technique.",

Objectives include: (1) Building a MultiStar Test Suite incorporating realistic simulationsand at-sea recordings; (2) Developing an advanced Kinematic Evaluator Controller (KEC); (3) Incorporation of interfaces for ranging and IPAC algorithms; (4) MultiStar integration and performance analysis; (5) Transition into the Advanced Processor Buildprogram (APB T 04).

        "abstract": "Cavitation peening is a novel method of inducing deep residual compressive stresses in components by sweeping an ultra-high pressure waterjet across the surface. The process is fast, very inexpensive and can be readily applied to a wide variety ofgeometries, including difficult to access surfaces such as intregrally bladed rotors (Blisks) and impellers. It is estimated that this new process will be less than 2% the cost of laser shock peening while achieving residual stress profiles twice as deepas conventional shot peening. It is also expected to achieve high fatigue life improvements of 3X and damage tolerance improvement of 15X. The proposed work will demonstrate the ability of cavitation peening to impart residual compressive stresses ontitanium and other alloys for small engine components. A peening work station will be built in Phase II for peening small engine components and fatigue benefits will be quantified and an economic analysis conducted to demonstrate benefits over alternateprocesses. In addition to greatly enhancing fatigue life and damage tolerance of turbine engine components, the process can also be applied to automotive gears, bearing races, engine components, airframes, springs, railroad tracks, and other fatiguecritical components. The market is expected to be as least as large as the $200M conventional peening business. Longer fatigue life and greater damage tolerance will result in fewer aircraft lost from engine failure and reduced maintenance costs and longercomponent life. Because the beneficial induced stresses are ten times deeper than conventional shot peening, the benefits to fatigue life will be dramatically improved. This feasibility of this process has been demonstrated in a nuclear power applicationand the proposed work will broaden the applications to turbine engines and power train components.",

PD6735 is being developed as a safe and effective treatment for sleep disorders that lacks the side effects of current first-line sleep medications.  Initial clinical studies indicate that PD6735 is safe and well tolerated in humans through the maximal dose tested, 20 mg. PD6735 produced a dose-response improvement in sleep latency in subjects with sleep onset insomnia (double-blind, placebo controlled, crossover study, N=1 9). The PD6735 effect on sleep latency was more pronounced at 20 mg than at 5 mg. The goal of the present Fast Track application is to determine whether the dose-response effect of PD6735 on sleep latency will be more pronounced at higher PD6735 doses. Phase 1 of this proposal will establish the safety and tolerability of PD6735 at 20 to 100 mg doses. Phase 2 will determine the effect of the 20 to 100 mg doses (or the maximum safe P 06735 dose identified in Phase I) on sleep latency in subjects with sleep-onset insomnia. The Specific Aims of the Phase 1 portion of this proposal are: \n\nAim I: Evaluate the safety and tolerability of PD6735 at doses up to 100 mg. Oral doses of 20, 35, 50 and 100 mg will be employed. \n\nAim 2: Determine the pharmacokinetics of PD6735 at doses up to 100 mg. \n\nAim 3: Determine the pharmacodynamics of PD6735 at doses up to 100 mg. PD6735 effects on body temperature and subjective sleepiness will be evaluated.  \nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS:\nSleep disorders affect over 60 million Americans who spend more than $1.4 billion on sleep medications would have a competitive advantage over current first line therapies by virtue of possessing fewer side effects. As such, the melatonin analog should capture a substantial portion of this market.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   \nThe goal of this project is to develop a sensor system for fecal-incontinent patients to alert the individual, or send a signal to their health-care attendants, of a bowel movement and that attention is required. The objective is to ultimately produce a small portable battery operated optical| sensing system that can be worn by the incontinent patient. The system will employ a disposable sensor placed in an individual's undergarment, which will act, like a \"sniffer\" and respond to odor associated with defecation. Specific aims and the research of Phase II encompass the following: Wearable fecal monitoring systems with electronic reporting/data logging capability will be designed and fabricated. These will be initially used to actively sense within briefs worn by incontinent patients, obtaining tracking data yielding information about background signal level that are typically encountered day-to-day within an elderly population in a convalescent care facility. This continuous monitoring data will be used to refine sensor signal discrimination schemes designed to define the system's \"alarm triggers\" indicating a fecal event. After programming sensors for discrimination, clinical trials with incontinent patients will sere to establish the sensitivity and selectivity of the fecal monitoring system. Additional patient trials will demonstrate medical and psychological benefits of fecal monitoring to incontinent patients through long-term clinical crossover study. Reduction of the duration of patient exposure to fecal matter is the critical health-care benefit this monitor provides. By reducing exposure time, there should be direct medical benefits of reduced frequency, severity, and associated cost of treating fecec-skin contact related skin infections, sores, and urinary tract infections. In addition to improving the quality of life and dignity of the incontinent, monitoring is expected to help prolong independent living, with significant reduction in health-care dollars spent, because incontinence is a major factor contributing to the decision to enter an assisted care facility.",

The goal is to obtain an EO polymer having a resistivity two order ofmagnitude lower than that of existing cladding materials. Following strategies have been designed to increase resistivity: a) Reduce the number of freely rotating single bonds in monomers, b) Reduce the amount of flexible pendant groups on chromophore todecrease thermal energy of chromophore, and c) Introduce more highly polar groups to increase static interactions. To compensate for the loss in thermal stability, we will reduce the number of freely rotating single bonds in monomers and the amount offlexible pendant groups on chromophore to decrease thermal energy of chromophore, and introduce more highly polar groups to increase static interactions. With increased core layer resistivity, poling efficiency and DC bias stability will be improved, andthe tolerance on cladding material will be larger in terms of resistivity.",

These individuals are hampered by the mechanical processes involved in reading, an important activity of daily living. The principal task in this endeavor is page turning. Current state-of-the-art automatic page turners do not serve this population well. This Phase II SBIR project addresses that challenge by focusing upon the design and development of a device capable of turning the pages of a book or magazine in a forward or reverse direction for hands-free operation. Extensive Phase I laboratory testing of a novel turnstile design and page pickup solution established the device's technical feasibility and potential cost-effectiveness. The overall goal of this project is to make an electromechanical page turner with an advanced design that is superior in several respects, including reliability, portability, ease of use, and cost. Preliminary results with six prototype models demonstrate an improved assistive technology that addresses design flaws prevalent in existing products and patents. Our research has identified three components to a successful design: page engagement, restraint, and transport. Failure to properly address these necessary elements has caused the introduction of a commercially viable product to remain elusive despite over fifty patents on the subject. The device being developed under this project overcomes these technical barriers and advances a design that integrates these three processes into a compact, light-weight, low-cost unit. In Phase II, fully functioning prototype units will be designed and fabricated. They will incorporate the results obtained during rigorous Phase I testing. An important element to the design process will be our use of the Pro/E software for industrial design, analysis, simulation, and synthesis. Interference studies, mass properties calculation, stress analysis, kinematics analysis, dynamics, visualization, and rigorous field testing are several of the pre-production tasks to be performed to validate the device, produce molds, and prepare for Phase III commercialization.",

        "abstract": "Description (provided by applicant):   \nThere is a pressing need for new drugs to treat HIV infection by virus strains that are resistant to the approved reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors. Panacos Pharmaceuticals' approach to overcoming drug resistance involves identifying HIV drug candidates with novel mechanisms of action. In collaboration with Professor K.H. Lee of The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Panacos has identified a promising HIV inhibitor, dimethyl succinyl betulinic acid (DSB). DSB potently inhibits HIV replication in vitro and is orally available in rats with a half-life of several hours. During the past few months, new data have been generated on DSB that provide a compelling case for the continued development of this compound. Of particular importance, it has been shown that DSB is the first in a new class of HIV drug candidates that block the last stage in the virus life cycle: budding/maturation. Furthermore, in vitro assays have demonstrated that DSB retains its nanomolar inhibitory activity against drug resistant strains of HIV, including isolates resistant to the three classes of approved drugs. This Phase II SBIR proposal has two major goals: First to identify DSB's molecular target. Mechanism of action studies will focus on targets that have been shown to play a role in HIV budding/maturation and will include determining the effect of DSB on: gag processing (p24-p2 cleavage); interaction between TSG 101 and the gag L domain; RNA dimerization; and cyclophilin incorporation into virions. The second goal is to complete pre-clinical testing of DSB, file an IND and initiate clinical testing of the novel drug candidate, focusing on the study of pharmacokinetics and safety in uninfected volunteers. If the results of pre-clinical testing indicate that DSB does not have suitable properties for clinical development, it will be replaced by a suitable analog generated during the project. The results of initial clinical studies in normal volunteers will be used as the basis to plan and perform efficacy studies in HIV-infected individuals that will be carried out subsequent to the Phase II grant period.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many human diseases, including cancers, have inadequate medical treatments. Often, inadequacy is not due to poor drug quality, but rather to limitations associated with the target of the drug (e.g. inadequate efficacy or unacceptable toxicity). New drug targets are therefore required to address these unmet medical needs. The availability of complete drafts of the human genome represents great potential for discovering new and effective targets for drug discovery and development. Although many descriptive technologies have been developed (e.g. expression arrays, proteomics, bio-informatics) to associate genes with human diseases, the information gained only partially identifies drug targets; they cannot predict/mimic the effects of drug products to demonstrate efficacy.   \n  \nPanGenex was established to exploit proprietary genetic technologies that directly tie the human genome with drug discovery. PanGenex believes that evaluation of gene knockouts on human disease attributes is highly predictive for effects of drugs and highly predictive for successful drug development. Advantages of gene knockouts include 100% inactivation of target genes with 100% specificity. PanGenex mission is to use its proprietary genetic technologies, including gene knockouts and reporter technologies, to identify and inactivate all human gene products within signaling networks relevant to human diseases to identify drug discovery targets with optimal efficacy and toxicity profiles (\"therapeutic profiling\").   \n  \nProof of concept for PanGenex technologies was established in SBIR Phase I studies. In Phase Il studies, a knockout vector library of over 60,000 sequences will be generated. Genes comprising the ErbB signaling network will be selected from this library for gene knockouts. PanGenex reporter technology will also be used to identify genes transcriptionally regulated by activation of the ErbB signaling network. Over 100 gene knockouts will be performed in pancreatic cancer cell lines and used in animal models to evaluate effects of gene knockouts on tumor growth delay and tumor regression. Mechanism of action studies on efficacious genes will follow. The knockout cells will also be evaluated for the ability to sensitize tumor cells to standard of care treatments for pancreatic cancer. Together, these data demonstrate the utility of PanGenex technologies to identify drug discovery targets with optimal activities.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transcription factors (TFs) are a group of proteins that regulate gene expression. In humans, they regulate the expression of about 30,000 genes. Their activities are in turn regulated by a number of different mechanisms including interaction with other transcription factors or co-regulators. Because of the large number of transcription factors (total about 2000) and the multitude of interactions among them, the transcriptional regulation network is complex and not yet understood. The answers to a series of important questions about gene regulation all rely on knowledge of the interaction of transcription factors. Therefore, establishing an interaction network of transcription factors is an extremely important task for us to complete before we can understand the mechanism of transcription regulation, uncover the abnormal regulatory processes in human diseases, and develop new therapeutic approaches. Current technologies such as co-immunoprecipitation, supershift, or the yeast two-hybrid system simply cannot meet the requirements for this task due to time consuming and labor intensive operations and problems in reliability. Panomics has developed array-based technologies that allow accurate determination of dual protein interactions as well as simultaneous multiple interactions. Here, we propose a two stage, Fast-Track approach for establishing an interaction network of approximately 20% of the potential transcription factors, 400 TFs. In Phase I, we will establish prototype arrays for protein-protein interactions and for transcription factor interaction in regulatory complexes. We will demonstrate the usefulness of these arrays by probing the interactions of a small number of key transcription factors. In Phase II, we will extend the array format to include the entire set of 400 transcription factors and will use the resulting data to develop a description of the interaction network. In the process, we will perfect the technology for extending the network to the entire complement of human transcriptional regulatory proteins. The objective of this project is to establish a new tool for understanding gene regulation during normal development and disease and to offer to researchers a set of reagents and database products, which are far more powerful than those currently available.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop a new, commercially viable micromachined silicon technology platform for the printing of DNA microarrays that offer significant advantages over current steel pin technology in cost and in quality. The Phase I effort demonstrated very clearly that a silicon pin reliably imbibed DNA printing solution and deposited spots with a size variance better than that of commercial steel printing pins. Phase II work will focus on the development of a new micromachining protocol based on a combination of wet and dry etching that will allow sculpting of the print tip in all three dimensions. This, in turn,  will permit the size, shape and fluid delivery characteristics of the tip to be finely tuned. Printing tip sizes (range : 125 microns x 125 microns to 25 microns  x 25 microns) and uptake volumes (range : 0 to 100nL) will allow the pins to precisely take up and deliver any volume or spot size/shape desired. Combined with a much denser packing of pins into a newly designed, all-silicon holder, these attributes will allow DNA microarrays to be fabricated at a cost, speed and quality previously unobtainable.\n\nThe commercial application of this project is in the area of DNA microarrays. Due to the weaknesses in the current manually machined steel pins used for printing DNA microarrays (such as extremely high manufacturing costs and low yield, poor pin-to- pin uniformity, the limited range of spot sizes deposited, waste of valuable DNA in uptake and delivery dead volumes, and deposit variability with time due to rapid tip wear), there is an urgent need for an improved printing technology. The new micromachined silicon printing product to be developed in this project will largely eliminate these drawbacks, and therefore will be well positioned for market entry as a replacement for existing products by virtue of its lower cost, superior accuracy and speed.",

This has the effect of decreasing the tool temperature, which increases tool life and improves the part quality.  These benefits come with significant drawbacks.  Cutting fluids are environmentally unfriendly, costly, and potentially toxic.  The recent shift to dry cutting has not completely solved the problem.  This option increases energy costs, increases per part costs, and requires a capital investment that is too large for most machine shops.  \n\nCreare, Inc.\u00c2\u00bfs solution is the Creare Cutting Tool-Cooling System (CUTS), which eliminates the use of cutting fluids by indirectly cooling the cutting tool.  CUTS is a prevention-oriented solution to the environmental and occupational health problems posed by cutting fluids.  The Phase I research project clearly demonstrated the technical and economic feasibility of CUTS.  When compared to dry cutting and jet cooling with a synthetic coolant, it was demonstrated that CUTS:  (1) reduces the environmental cost of the machining process by a factor of two for jet cooling with a synthetic coolant, and by 21 percent for dry machining; (2) increases the tool life by 700 percent at low cutting speeds, and by 50 percent at high cutting speeds; (3) decreases part production costs by at least 20 percent; and (4) improves the final part quality while maintaining a high degree of dimensional accuracy.  \n\nAs a result of this work, the U.S. Army Armament Research and Development Center, one of the largest manufacturing centers in the country, will provide federal non-SBIR funding to support development and onsite testing during Phase II, with the goal of eliminating the use of machining coolants in its Prototype Manufacturing Center.

        "abstract": "Advanced space-borne infrared sensor technology requires cooling at temperatures near 10 K.  Cooling loads for these detectors will range from 0.25 to 1.0 W at 10 K, with additional loads at higher temperatures.  A multistage cooler, capable of coolingmultiple loads, will offer large potential gains in system efficiency and weight.  Turbomachine-based, Brayton cryocoolers are ideal candidates for these missions because they are highly efficient, lightweight, vibration-free, adaptable to multiple stages,and have long, maintenance-free lifetimes.  State-of-the-art technology exists for all the critical components except for a 10 K turboalternator.  Creare proposes to develop an advanced, high-efficiency turboalternator optimized for a multistage,multi-load application.  The advanced turboalternator will enable a significant reduction in cryocooler input power and overall cooling system mass.  In Phase I, we performed trade studies to determine an optimum multistage, multi-load cryocoolerconfiguration for a specific Air Force application, and determined that significant weight and power savings were possible with this configuration.  We then developed a conceptual design for this cryocooler, and a preliminary design of an advancedlow-temperature turboalternator.  In Phase II, we will fabricate this turboalternator and demonstrate its performance at prototypical operating conditions.",

However, application of the technology to other fields of surgery has been slow. During this project, we plan to address one of the primary technical barriers by developing an endoscopic system for measurement of the shape and deformation of organs during minimally invasive surgery. The resulting data will be used for coregistration of patient and image coordinate systems and to drive deformable tissue models. The Phase II work will be evaluated using a series of phantom and experimental animal tests performed at Creare and Vanderbilt University.",

During Phase I, a comprehensive design for the complete test apparatus was developed using unique computational models forfluid flow and heat and mass transfer through textiles.  The apparatus is compact, modest in acquisition and operational cost, flexible, and easy to use.  During the proposed Phase II base project, a prototype apparatus will be constructed and thoroughlytested and will include evaluation of Navy-supplied textile samples.  The proposed Phase II option will result in construction and delivery of a refined commercially-ready version of the apparatus. The proposed test apparatus will enable the Navy, othermilitary services, and others in government and industry to quickly and inexpensively evaluate the protective characteristics of candidate textiles for fire fighting and steam-protective ensembles.

The technical approach presented here is a result of a successful demonstration of an emergency egress window concept during the previous Phase I program.  Currently available egress windows suffer from two basic problems:  All require that a large amount of gasket material be removed by passengers prior to freeing the glass and all force the passenger to handle a large pane of glass actuating the release mechanism.  The freed glass would then fall into the interior of the passenger car and possibly on the passenger.  Pulling several feet of gasket material could be problematical during a tumultuous accident, especially with a passenger car falling on its side.",

The Army has a need to develop a needle-free system for delivering the bioscavenger.  Currentneedle-free systems are not available for delivering large quantities of BChE.  Foster-Miller proposes an advanced needle-free injector that is practical in battlefield situations.  The Phase II program consists of three parts.  First, the formulationdevelopment work of Phase I will be expanded to focus on the stability of BChE in both the lyophilized and liquid forms.  Secondly a prototype delivery device capable of handling smaller volumes will be developed.

        "abstract": "In Phase I, Foster-Miller has designed an automated shipboard food preparation and service system that utilizes scratch, precooked or frozen advanced foods.  The system employs robotic pickers to load trays of frozen items (i.e. entr\u00c2\u00bfe, vegetable, andstarch) into ovens, and then deposits the cooked foods into a service/warming station for self-serve by the sailors. Cooking from scratch can be eliminated, and scullery operations are reduced (no pots or pans used to produce meal), resulting in areduction in labor requirements of approximately 67%.  Shipboard business processes are improved through the real-time information provided by the system (meal choice, inventory status).  Data are sent to the shipboard information systems, facilitatingbetter meal planning, historical knowledge of sailor preferences, more efficient purchasing and inventory control.  In Phase II, an automated food service system will be designed, constructed, and tested for the DDG51.  This same system will be used as abasis for the forward-fit needs (engineering development) of the DD(X).  Foster-Miller will partner with DD(X) Gold Team (NGSS Ingalls Operation), Natick Soldier Center (NSC), and NSWCCD-SSES to ensure that the Navy's requirements are met in the Phase IIprogram. (P-030060) Commercial applications for an automated food service system include industrial, commercial, and institutional cafeterias, and also fast-food type restaurants.  A breakdown of cost-of-operation of a commercial cafeteria shows that thedominant cost is labor.  The concept of an unmanned automated cafeteria is very attractive, particularly in situations where the total number of occupants will not support a manned facility.  The automated food service system offers a new market for foodservice companies in small-to-midsize companies.",

The proposed laser is a diode-pumped, double-clad, Yb-doped multicore fiber array arranged in twoisometric rings, which are embedded in a very large cladding having a very large NA, so that a pump laser with fairly large beam spot can be injected efficiently into the inner cladding from the side-wall along the length of the fiber.  Under this PhaseII-SBIR, a prototype will be built, packaged, characterized and delivered to the Army.  The goal of this project is to demonstrate a reliable and maintenance-free high-energy fiber laser, emitting a high-brightness and diffraction-limited beam with anoutput power greater than 200W in a spot size of about 50 microns.  Through this effort, not only a high-energy fiber laser will be developed specially for the Army's application, but also a sound foundation will be laid for commercializing an affordableindustrial laser, which will provide a high-brightness output in the power range from 100W to 1,000W for a variety of industrial applications.Diode-pumped multicore fiber laser can provide very high output power with a high-brightness anddiffraction-limited beam at an affordable cost.  It is therefore very competitive in the market place as compared to diode-pumped solid-state lasers and CO2 lasers presently employed by the industries for high speed and precision manufacturing.",

Consensus IFN and pegylated IFNs (PEG Intron and Pegasys) - are useful in the treatment of several viral diseases and cancers. However, when used at therapeutic doses they produce frequent and sometimes serious side effects, including fever, myalgia, CNS effects and leukopenia, which limit their use. IFNinterferon, a structurally related interferon in ruminants, has similar antiviral and antitumor properties as the IFNalpha's but little or no toxicity. However, as a xenoprotein IFNinterferon is not a suitable candidate for development as a parenteral drug for humans. We have synthesized an analog of human IFNalpha2b, NLVgalpha2b, which contains five amino acid substitutions at positions19, 20, 22, 24 and 27 using residues from the corresponding positions in the IFNinterferon molecule. The in vitro and in vivo data from our SBIR phase I study demonstrated that these substitutions conferred markedly reduced cellular toxicity on the resulting molecule without diminishing its antiviral and antitumor activities. In this phase II project we will advance NLVgalpha2b into preclinical development by optimizing expression of this recombinant IFN in yeast, producing pegylated as well as unpegylated preparations and subjecting them to rigorous evaluation in well established animal models. The antiviral, anticancer, immunogenicity and toxicity profiles of NLVgalpha2b will be compared with those of commercially available IFNalpha2b. If this project is successful, it should be possible to administer NLVgalpha2b to patients in higher doses than can be achieved with current IFNalpha's, resulting in improved clinical outcomes.",

The Phase II goal will be development of more capable technology that can be configured to meet the specialized requirements of any cancer center.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The present technical ability to sequence entire mammalian genomes outpaces current computational and experimental abilities to decode the information contained within these sequences. Cross-species sequence comparisons are a powerful method for decoding genomic information due to the fact that functional elements are conserved through evolution whereas nonfunctional sequences drift. Because the rate of evolution varies widely in different regions of a genome within a species as well as for orthologous sequences between species, a comprehensive comparative analysis of the human genome will require that it be compared with the genomic sequences of multiple mammals. At the current cost of sequencing mammalian genomes it is too expensive to obtain in-depth sequence coverage of more than a few mammals. Thus, we are left with the choice of forgoing the information that would be obtained by multi-species comparisons or employing a high-resolution scanning approach, such as described in this proposal, for comparing human sequences with the DNA of multiple mammals. In phase I of the proposed research, we will analyze the data from a pilot study in which a 300-kb region of human chromosome 21 has been compared with the DNA of five mammals using oligonucleotide high-density arrays. We will improve the current algorithms employed for detecting and characterizing evolutionarily conserved sequences using high-density arrays. In addition, we will demonstrate that multi-species comparative analysis using high-density arrays combined with targeted dideoxy-sequencing can obtain the homologous sequences of biologically interesting conserved elements across multiple mammals. During phase II of this proposal, we will screen approximately 32 Mb of human chromosome 21 for conserved sequences by hybridizing high-density arrays with orthologous dog, cat, cow, pig, and horse DNA. The goal of this proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of the high-density array approach for identifying conserved human elements by comparative analysis with multiple mammals across the entire human genome.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   \nThe purpose of this Phase II project is to further develop and evaluate an electronic diary system, the Medication Monitoring Field Evaluation System (MMFES). Compared to pencil and paper diaries and logs, self-monitoring of medication use, side effects, symptomatology, and other variables via a handheld computer such as Palm or a PocketPC devices (PDAs) offers the potential for improved recording compliance as well as the potential to monitor in real time and to deliver complex monitoring protocols (e.g. conditional branching) in an easy to use PDA interface. Although electronic diaries have been used in some recent studies, a major barrier to regular use is the programming costs to produce the self-monitoring protocols on the PDA, costs which must be incurred with each new study. The MMFES provides researchers with a desktop program, which allows anyone without programming experience to create the self-monitoring protocols they wish to deliver and download these to the PDA for use by subjects, and then subsequently upload the data for analysis. In Phase I, a prototype MMFES was developed. A small group of researchers using the prototype provided positive ratings of the system and feedback for Phase II improvements. The program also was tested in an \"analogue\" drug trial with 49 smokers using nicotine gum and monitoring use, side effects, and symptoms either via paper and pencil log or via the MMFES on a PocketPC. The results of the feasibility trial showed that the MMFES produced greater recording compliance than the manual log entries and was rated as easy to use. In Phase II, the prototype will be fully developed, including Palm compatibility and remote web centric access. The Phase II program will first be tested in a pilot analogue drug trial similar to Phase I. One hundred researchers will evaluate the program following a demonstration and trial use of the desktop and PDA programs. Finally, the program will be evaluated in actual clinical drug trials to assess usability, concurrent validity, and recording compliance.",

The purpose of this project is to design, develop, and evaluate a computerized self-help intervention that provides a comprehensive behavioral treatment of insomnia. A Phase I prototype of the Insomnia Assessment and Treatment Program (IATP) was developed which assessed sleep and wake states using an active sleep sampling procedures and then implemented a stimulus control and sleep restriction intervention. The resulting prototype was evaluated with 86 subjects, comparing the IATP to a comparison group provided with monitoring and educational treatment components only. Despite the active components of the comparison group, the IATP condition produced superior improvement on most of the sleep parameters evaluated during the trial. For Phase II, the program will be redesigned and redeveloped on a specific purpose platform. The program will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial of 200 subjects with chronic primary insomnia, comparing the IATP treatment program to a self-help behavioral treatment book for insomnia and the IATP device for monitoring purposes only. Subjects will be evaluated at baseline and at weeks 7, 14, and 28 on sleep diary and self-report data of sleep quality, efficiency, and impairment. Home-based, multi-night polysomnography also will be performed on a subset of the sample at baseline and at 14 weeks. The results of this project could produce an empirically validated behavioral treatment for insomnia, which is easily accessed by the millions of people suffering from chronic primary insomnia.",

Helping patients control their diabetes can decrease complications, improve quality of life, and decrease costs of care. Nutrition and exercise to achieve a healthy weight are key behavioral interventions in diabetes management. However, clinic-based weight management programs are expensive, difficult to deliver on a population-basis and are not typically structured to meet the unique needs of medically underserved Hispanic populations. The goal of this proposal is to test a practical and easily delivered intervention for weight management to assist underserved Hispanic diabetics. The intervention will utilize a computer-based software program to tailor the intervention to the unique needs of each patient. Evidence-based behavioral models that hold promise for helping individuals make changes to better manage body weight will be applied. This system is designed to operate on clinic-based personal computers and will provide individual assessment and tailored, real-time and feedback reports to patients and physician/healthcare provider reports outlining key areas for patient improvement and counseling suggestions for practitioners. In Phase II, we will test this treatment approach using a randomized design comparing TEST and CONTROL conditions with a sample of 306 medically under-served Hispanic diabetics with a body-mass-index (BMI) greater than 25. The intervention system is expected to improve glucose control and weight management in the TEST population at a rate greater than the CONTROL population.",

Both configurations will be optimized for 2-10 micron particle collection efficiency, power consumption, size,cost, and weight.  The design arrangement to be developed is comprised of a custom inlet, a novel collection chamber, and a continuous gas-to-liquid concentration mechanism.  An autonomous, `point-into-the-wind', iso-kinetic inlet will be used to maximizethe inlet collection efficiency for difficult sampling conditions, such as shipboard sampling.  The aerosol collection and concentration mechanism being studied exhibits the combined behavior of an impactor, cyclone, and centrifuge. This unique system hasbeen demonstrated during Phase I analytical studies.  The gas-to-liquid concentrator will consist of a re-circulating liquid injection and recovery system.  A preconditioning impactor and screen stage is used to remove large particles.  Phase I activitieswill culminate in the construction of a slightly simplified, but full-scale (600 LPM), prototype for `proof-of-concept' testing purposes.  Construction of the first prototype is ongoing at this time.  Primary focus has been, and will continue to be, placedon developing the high flow rate collector.  Late-stage efforts will modify this design for low flow rate applications.The proposed designs could have immediate application in Army, and other Joint Services activities, if all project targets are achieved.Other government agencies, such as the Office of Homeland Defense, US Postal Service, and Environmental Protection Agency may also have need for similar devices.  Additionally, civilian applications exist in areas such as pollution monitoring,environmental monitoring, hazard detection, and, particularly, in medical and virology settings.  Interest has been expressed concerning coupling a smaller version of this device with a biosensor application for airborne particulate toxicity detection.",

        "abstract": "Environmental regulations for air emission and waste disposal have created a need for paint removal methods that are both economically and environmentally acceptable.  Furthermore, architectural surfaces painted prior to 1978 have lead paint that should be removed to meet U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) lead concentration standards.\n\nImproved paint removal techniques are needed because \u00c2\u00bfacceptable\u00c2\u00bf techniques are inadequate.  Media blasting and abrasive techniques, for example, generate a large volume of debris and can damage architectural materials.  Chemical strippers are labor intensive, messy, and may be toxic.  Also, many stripped surfaces require additional preparation before repainting. \n\nHowever, pulses of light, a technology being developed by Phoenix Science & Technology, Inc. (PS&T), removes paint without generating secondary waste and without damaging the surface.  The technology also leaves behind a surface ready for repainting.  Paint strippers using flashlamps and lasers are commercially available, but they are too expensive and impractical for removing paint from architectural surfaces.  Phase I and subsequent internal research and development (R&D) work at PS&T demonstrated the feasibility of using this pulsed light source to meet lead concentration standards for architectural surfaces at high removal rates needed for commercialization. \n\nThe proposed Phase II research project will continue the development of this photolytic paint removal process using PS&T\u00c2\u00bfs new lamp, with the potential to become a practical, low-cost paint stripper of architectural surfaces.  The Phase II objectives are to:  (1) determine optimum light pulse parameters for removing paints from architectural materials, (2) demonstrate an effluent capture system that meets air quality standards, (3) develop a robotic scanner to control the paint removal process, (4) develop a prototype depainter that meets HUD cleanliness standards for lead concentration, and (5) conduct a field test demonstration.  The Phase II research project will be a sister program both to a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) program to develop the lamp technology needed for commercialization and a HUD Office of Healthy Homes program to develop a hand-held paint stripper to complement the large area paint stripper of this proposed Phase II research project.  Together, the NIST, HUD, and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency programs provide a comprehensive R&D program for lead paint removal in homes.  A manufacturer of detectors for measuring lead concentration in paint will support Phase II and is a potential partner for the commercialization of a paint stripper using PS&T\u00c2\u00bfs lamp.",

This lens-like grating-outcoupled surface-emitting (LLGSE) laser is designed for powers of about 10 W (300microns wide and 1 cm long).   Applications of LLGSEs include pumping solid state lasers used in laser radar systems, laser designators, and countermeasure systems.   The LLGSE includes within the epitaxial structure a reflecting stack to minimize loss oflight towards the epitaxial (p-side) metal contact caused by the bi-directional outcoupling of the grating.  Because our device is surface-emitting, the manufacturing process can have the economy of scale associated with the silicon IC industry, sincecomplete devices can be probe-tested at the wafer level.  With surface-emission, the labor intensive handling required for facet coating of edge-emitting devices is eliminated, as is catastrophic optical damage (COD) and gradual facet degradation.  Thisdevice has potential for extremely low cost and high electrical to optical efficiencies.  The highly coherent, high brightness, single-lobe far-field provides a factor of three increase in coupling efficiency over conventional broad area diode lasers.High power monolithic arrays of LLGSEs for very high power  increases reliability compared to conventional laser bar arrays.",

        "abstract": "70397S02-II   The gradients associated with plasma-based accelerators, such as a laser wakefield accelerator, are much larger than those in conventional accelerators.  To realize the potential of a laser wakefield accelerator and obtain high-energy electrons, it is necessary to (1) provide a means to guide the laser beam, and (2) stage the accelerating module to reduce dephasing.  This project will address both issues and perform experiments to achieve electron energies approaching 1 GeV.  Gas-filled capillary discharges will be employed to optically guide the laser beam over extended distances.  To mitigate dephasing in a laser wakefield accelerator, two or more capillaries, placed end-to-end with increasing plasma density, will be configured.  In Phase I, design parameters were obtained using scaling models and reduced analytical models.  Particle-in-cell simulations, employing massively-parallel, fully-electromagnetic codes, were then employed to refine the design.  Phase II will conduct experiments that employ a 10 Hz, 10 TW, and 50 fs Ti-sapphire laser beam.  A fraction of the beam will be extracted and utilized for the injector, and the rest will be used to drive a wakefield in a plasma channel made up of several capillaries, each of which has a uniform density along the direction of propagation.  Accelerated electrons will be detected and analyzed by employing dipole magnets, ?erenkov radiation, and nuclear activation.

Their count rate is severely limited to about 3K/sec making two-dimensional elemental mapping extremely time consuming.  For example, this low count rate makes it impossible to acquire elemental maps simultaneously with near-real-time images, thereby impeding the analysis of data.  Furthermore, current detectors are prone to radiation damage caused by high-energy backscattered electrons.  This project will develop silicon drift detector (SDD) technology and produce a new type of detector that has a very low capacitance and can achieve low noise at short shaping times.  This feature will allow the simultaneous attainment of very high-count rates and excellent energy resolution, required for elemental mapping.  The SDD device is expected to yield electronic noise better than 10 electrons RMS (70 eV FWHM) at optimum peaking times of ?500 ns and posses an active area up to 0.5 cm2.  Also, the implanted contact technology used for SDDs should have better radiation resistance than the Schottky-barrier type used with Si[Li] detectors.  Phase I developed a prototype detector package that was inserted into a TEM at Argonne National Laboratory for testing.  The performance of the system has exceeded all measures of success.

The photonic TTD beamformer is projected to consume 100x less dc power than a digital beamformer of equivalent size.  Further, the number of delays required by this beamformer grows onlylinearly with N--for an array with N x N elements--which is a major advance over prior beamformers, in which the number of delays grew as N^2.  This Phase II effort also establishes performance goals for two component development efforts necessary toenable a high-performance TTD beamformer: an optical switch and a module that provides a photonic interface to the transmit and receive (T/R) antenna.  As an option we propose a test that combines a prototype of the TTD beamformer with a fiber optic switch(either a prototype from a parallel SBIR or a COTS switch).

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   \nInappropriate apoptosis is the cause of many human diseases, including cancer, neuronal degeneration, hearing loss, organ failure, myelodysplastic syndrome, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, thyroiditis, and ulcerative colitis. Compounds that affect apoptosis are potential therapeutics. Cell based assays are widely used in drug development, however, many promising candidates fail in subsequent mammalian testing. Zebrafish assays can serve as an intermediate step between cellular evaluation and mammalian testing. Zebrafish has several advantages, including transparent embryos for easy visual analysis, rapid embryonic development and low cost. Furthermore, similar pharmacological responses to those in the mammalian apoptotic machinery are present in zebrafish. Currently the standard whole animal apoptosis assay is TUNEL, a histochemical staining technique which detects apoptotic cells in sectioned tissue. This assay is time-consuming and permits examination at only a single time point. Since many degenerative diseases occur in stages, assay formats that permit continuous examination of changes in the apoptosis pattern and the duration of drug effects are needed. Using zebrafish embryos, this proposal will develop a quantitative microplate assay for high throughput screening of compounds. Complementary visual and flow cytometry based assays will also be developed to provide comprehensive analysis of apoptosis in zebrafish.",

Based on the findings and success of Phase I, PACproposes to design, fabricate and demonstrate a prototype system, to be used for field inspection. The system will be base on Guided Wave Acousto-Ultrasonic (GWAU) technology. The system will automatically inspect the SAPI, calculate an average acousticproperty and compare the values with a built-in pass/fail criteria. The pass/fail criteria will be determined based on ballistic testing of SAPI samples with controlled damage created by low-velocity impact.   We anticipate that the Phase II effort willresult in the development and integration of the proposed SAPI inspection prototype instrument.  Utilizing our latest generation digital signal processing system (DiSP), the prototype will be designed and built around existing products, but with anemphasis on portability and inspection automation.  This will lay the foundation for a Phase III commercialization commitment with the U.S. Army and other interested parties for the marketing of SAPI inspection systems.  It is also expected that themanufacturers of ceramic/FRP SAPI will be interested in using the system as a quality assurance tool.In addition, we believe that law enforcement agencies such as FBI, ATF, and Police Departments, which are users of personnel armor, will be interested in the technology. In order to tap into this potential market, we envision a completely portable versionof the inspection system.",

To meet Army needs, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) is developing a new Universal Video Compression (UVC) system, compatible withpresent and future DTV and compression standards.  Integrated hardware and diversified software compression will also support wireless transmission of compressed video.  With UVC object enhancement, a video scene is parsed into background, compressed atlower quality, and foreground objects, compressed at higher quality without compression artifacts.  This saves bandwidth, because objects occupy relatively little of the video frame, and thus require fewer blocks for representation; compression efficiencyis proportional to the ratio of background area to the combined area of the objects. UVC integrates the existing MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG&#64979;4, H.261, H.26L and wavelet video compression standards.  Object enhancement is done in both the temporal andspatial domains.  One means of object classification is POC's proprietary singularity mapping, based on catastrophe theory.  POC expects to improve on state-of-the-art compression ratios by over an order of magnitude in Phase II, and to fabricatecompression/communication hardware that will be 2.5 in. x 4 in. x 1 in., weigh ~100 g, and draw 3 W.This Phase II project represents a breakthrough in innovative video compression technology.

The Phase I research showed that the Army needs for beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) video transmission can be met by wavelet-based video compression withunique adaptive wavelet quantization combined with efficient code division multiple access (CDMA) communication hardware Tunable Data Rate (TUNDRA) compression and communication.  Its key strength is the ability to dynamically adapt transmission data rateto communication channel quality through adaptive video compression.

The increasing sophistication of counterbattery fire, with the emphasis on mobility and accurate coordinated fire in modern warfare, obviateconventional survey techniques and place an emphasis on the use of inertial navigation systems and GPS.  Present INSs are imprecise, bulky, and vulnerable to the intense shocks of recoil.  Physical Optics Corporation proposes to develop the novelDistributed Reference Inertial Artillery Direction (DRIAD) system, consisting of a redundant network of sensing nodes incorporating MEMS inertial sensors and carrier differential GPS receivers to sense the position and motion of the gun.  This informationis collected via a fault tolerant network of concentrator nodes.  Spatio-temporal sensor fusion algorithm filtering is applied to the data to obtain an optimal estimate of position and orientation and the corresponding trajectory with 0.5 mil accuracy,under severe motion dynamics and during GPS coverage gaps.  This novel algorithm combines least squares rigid body methods with Kalman filtering.  In Phase II the inertial sensors and carrier differential GPS receivers developed and evaluated in Phase Iwill be integrated into a prototype system that will be demonstrated under realistic conditions closely simulating those of field operations.DRIAD's extremely precise positioning and pointing information will find tremendous commercial opportunities inautomobile navigation, telematics, survey, inspection, public safety and emergency WLANs (such as E911).  Within the military, use of DRIAD technology will greatly enhance the capacity of forward observers to direct fire precisely without the need toactively designate targets, greatly increasing their lethality and survivability.",

The portable HEAR sensor for measuring the infrared properties will find many commercial applications,including industrial furnace maintenance and manufacturing, where it is important to monitor durability at high temperature; thermal control for the aerospace industry, supersonic and hypersonic aircraft and spacecraft development, where efficient surfaceradiation is necessary for cooling at large Mach numbers and at high altitudes; vehicle, ship, and target signature analysis for laser radar; surface quality control for finished products such as toys, foods, and other goods; coating/paint durabilityprediction for the paint industry; development of low or high emissivity paints/coatings; image recognition for robots; signature simulation of artificial targets; and evaluation of  biological tissues for diagnosis under selected spectral radiation.",

PDT uses the affinity of photosensitizers such as hematoporphyrin derivative (HPD) and other compounds to be selectively retained in malignant tumors.  When tumors, pretreated with the photosensitizer, are irradiated with visible light, a photochemical reaction occurs and tumor cells are destroyed. Oxygen molecules in their metastable singlet delta state O2 (1delta) are believed to be the species that destroys cancerous cells during PDT. A real-time optical diagnostic for singiet oxygen in-vivo would be a valuable dosimeter during PDT treatment. Based on a successful Phase I program, Physical Sciences Inc. proposes to develop and test a real-time optical monitor for singlet oxygen. We will use diode laser technology and ultra-sensitive photon counting methods. Extensive in-vitro testing will be performed using several photosensitizers. Crucial in-vivo tests will also be performed on tumor models in laboratory rats. These tests will be performed with our collaborators at the Massachusetts General Hospital.  Success will lead to a product for medical research in PDT. The successful demonstration of the diagnostic could lead to numerous applications. For example, one could study the photo-induced HPD process in much more detail. New porphyrin compounds could be screened for O2 (1delta) production efficiency.

        "abstract": "Ultrashort laser pulses have led to the development and demonstration of filamenting lasers, which make possible a vast array of new military and civil applications.  These applications result from the filaments' novel ability to channel extremely highfluences through self-focussed channels in the atmosphere.  The channels are ionized to electron densities, comparable to those of metals, and the filament (channel) diameter is roughy 100 microns.  The laser intensity inside a filament is sufficient toionize air, while any condensed matter it contacts is devastated, including transparent or reflective materials.  Recent theory and experiments suggest that filaments can be scaled up to tens of kilometers, containing tens of Joules.  The abilitiy to crossvery complicated flow fields, including turbulence, shockwaves, and combustion environments makes filaments yet more attractive for long-range applications.  This program will map the effects of ultra-intense laser pulses on materials of significantmilitary and commercial value, over a broad range of pulse parameters.  The resulting data will allow not only the optimization of laser-ablation, tuned to these specific materials, it will also allow the identification of optimum lasers for specificmilitary missions.  A natural commercial application is the ability to tune ultrashort laser pulses for optimized micromachining.",

No such interferometric imaging THz spectrometer is currently commercially available.  The proposed system will be useful not only in defense applications as a stationary perimeterdefense system and outward looking remote surveillance system, but for civilian security applications as well, such as airport screening for explosives, biological agents, and other contraband.

The new designs included more robust grammar parsing and syntax checking of queries, integration of Grid security mechanisms, database resource usage monitoring and limiting, and extended user interface capabilities.  With software leveraged from other sources, Phase II will integrate these designs into the Grid framework, ensuring that the end solution readily adapts to existing Grid standards and emerging Grid specifications.

Such gimbaledsystems will require control systems that can accommodate the time-varying disturbances, rigid-body, and flexible dynamics resulting from the changing geometry as the payload is slewed.To address these issues, we showed the feasibility of (Phase I) and propose to demonstrate (Phase II) an adaptive control design approach that works during operation to autonomously identify the time-varying gimbaled optical system dynamics affecting theslewing bandwidth, then design feedback and feedforward control laws to achieve predefined performance and stability criteria.

For refractory metals such as tungsten (W) to be used in fusion applications, improvements in both mechanical and physical properties are needed.  Because recent work identified the benefits of nanosize, transition-metal-carbide dispersoids within tungsten, this project will develop fabrication techniques to enable the near net shape forming of nanograined W and W alloys, with improved resistance to embrittlement, for use in fusion reactors.  Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of producing near net shape W components comprised of ultra-fine grained microstructures.  Analyses of the samples showed that tungsten materials reinforced with transition metal carbide have a higher recrystallization temperature, experience less grain growth at elevated temperatures, and have higher hardness values than pure tungsten samples.  During Phase II, techniques developed during Phase I will be optimized and used to fabricate extensive material property specimens.  Rhenium additions will be evaluated to further improve ductility. Finally, plasma facing component mockups will be fabricated to demonstrate the scalability of the process.

The extension of the life of protective claddings for the many billions of dollars worth of steel construction owned by the Navy that are subjected to splashing and tidal immersion in sea water will represent substantial repetitive annual savings for theNavy. In addition, similar installations belonging to other branches of the military and to civilian government organizations will reap similar benefits from using the new claddings. Many non-government civilian operations can also benefit. The significantperformance improvement involved will also open the possibility of additional export business to serve foreign entities and to better preserve operational effectiveness for all users. The use of readily available commercial raw materials produced in theUSA and the ease of application already indicated provide confidence that the economic attractiveness of the new cladding is assured.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) are a range of health problems, which impact over 2 billion people. IDD covers a wide spectrum of clinical conditions, Goiter is the visible \"marker condition\" for more severe disorders. Some disorders are the result of compensation mechanisms, such as thyroid enlargement, early abortions, still births, increased infant mortality, mental and growth retardation. Some disorders are associated with permanent brain damage that occurs during the first two trimesters of pregnancy. The resulting clinical condition, cretism is irreversible and is the single most severe and dramatic manifestation of IDD. Iodine supplementation through salt fortification has shown to eliminate all deficient disorders from goiter through cretism. In several countries tremendous social and economic gains have resulted from the control of IDD. The World Bank has concluded that iodine supplementation is one of the interventions \"that would have the highest cost-effectiveness of any health intervention available in the world today\" (World Bank 1993). There is overwhelming evidence to prevent IDD by increasing iodine intake by populations at large. The need for a simple, inexpensive, semi-quantitative iodine test for urinary screen is acute and broadly based throughout the world. PortaScience has proposed the development of a disposable device for the measurement of iodide in salt solutions and urine that can be used in a clinical setting, in the field or at home. The proposed test in Phase II will have a mini column and reagent chambers all built in one piece of disposable cassette. The test weighs less than three ounces, can be stored and shipped at ambient temperature, and gives an accurate result. Phase I studies have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed method by removing interfering compounds in a single step, identifying a suitable membrane material, identifying a sensitive dye, and manually assembling test devices for testing urine that met Phase I precision and accuracy criteria.",

Standard injection, trapping, and extraction designs will be fielded on the Positronics Research LLC (PRLLC) Positron Penning Trap-1 (PPT-1) experiment. The VPE is tailored specifically to understand the PPT-1experiment. Four basic issues are positron plasma column stability, confinement time scaling, insulator breakdown, and efficient trapping of positron beams. In Phase I, PRLLC has assembled a 16-processor Linux cluster. In Phase II the cluster will beupgraded to 64-processors. In addition to the ASPEN code, the three-dimensional ICEPIC code will be installed on the cluster. The opportunity to incorporate large-scale simulation technology into the antimatter confinement program will increase the abilityto understand the physics of the PPT-1 experiment, which will ultimately lead to successful design of second-generation experiments. The deliverable will be a final report that includes a description of the cluster design, verification and validationresults, full-scale simulation results of the PPT-1 experiment, as well as the evaluation of a number of novel injection, trapping, and extraction concepts.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase II project provides the foundational R&D for new oil and gas reservoir management tools to optimize hydrocarbon recovery. It proposes extension of state-of-the-art analytic solution methods for potential flow in porous media from 2-D to 3-D. It incorporates 3-D analytic fluid flow simulation technology into large-scale optimization routines where reservoir recovery performance is required, such as in the optimum placement of new wells or the optimum operation of existing wells. Unlike previous analytic solution methods, complex heterogeneous reservoir architecture can be managed without a loss of accuracy.  This project will provide a new class of reservoir management tools capable of rapidly and accurately screening what-if scenarios for field development. Phase II will: i) generalize analytic solution boundary element methodology to three dimensions, ii) build a prototype, 3-D, well optimization tool, iii) develop analytic stream-function technology for optimization of improved recovery operations, and iv) extend algorithms to additional geometric shapes for enhanced flexibility.\n\nPowerful analytic solution technology has been developed that allows robust solution of fluid flow problems with complex, heterogeneous rock properties. This general analytic solution methodology is an industry first, providing the ability to generate a brand new line of desktop hydrocarbon reservoir management tools. In particular, the results of this project will provide software and services to optimally locate new wells within existing hydrocarbon reservoirs. While reservoir simulation and well planning software both exist in the marketplace, no current commercial product offers the ability to rigorously compute well productivity within a feedback loop of a powerful gradient search optimization method to automatically select the best drilling location for new wells. This technology also addresses the optimum performance of existing wells in improved recovery operations. Using analytic stream-function optimization, well configurations in mature fields can be optimized for maximum productivity and ultimate recovery, thus minimizing unrecoverable natural resources.",

Current protective materials and techniques for making them are very expensive and are limited in availability.  This project will utilize boron carbide (B4C) (boron for neutron absorption), coated with nickel (metal to join and protect the boron) and applied with thermal spray coating techniques, to develop a protective neutron absorption material.  Phase I accomplished the initial feasibility and scale-up.  In particular, Phase I demonstrated that neutron absorption could be varied with the composition of B4C, and then identified a large-quantity U.S. manufacturer for nickel carbonyl, quantified the cost savings that would accrue from using Ni/boron carbide (Ni/B4C) for neutron absorption, and obtained initial corrosion data for the Ni/B4C system.  Phase II will optimize the coating processes (both plasma spray and CVD powder) and composition, manufacture the precursor to lower cost of the product, generate materials data for design candidates, and select and fabricate components.    Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  Nickel/boron carbide powders should have application in composite materials, thermal spray coating, and wear resistance.

It is the strongest ductile material known at 2000\u00c2\u00bfC and totally impervious to hydrogen and the combustionproducts of most solid propellants to 2500\u00c2\u00bfC. But rhenium has been little used because of its high density and high cost. Many applications exist where the density is not important, but few exist where the improved performance is worth the cost. The costof rhenium components is composed of two elements: the cost of the raw material and the cost of the fabrication. A rule-of-thumb in determining the cost of a rhenium component is: 80% of the total cost is fabrication. Another rule-of-thumb is: 75% of thevalue of the starting raw material will be thrown away. These are true for all current rhenium fabrication processes. In addition, there is no current production route that significantly decreases the first article cost. In Phase I Powdermet demonstrated aproduction-suitable rhenium manufacturing technology that uses 50% less raw material and reduces the production processing costs by 50-80%. Applied to the NTW system SDACS, this manufacturing process could reduce the production cost by 50% or more. InPhase II Powdermet will optimize the processing and turn it into a qualified manufacturing process for SDACS and other military and commercial rhenium components.",

        "abstract": "The SBIR application seeks support to develop and study a computer- based product attended primary for teaching children with mental retardation, autism, and other intellectual disabilities. The product addresses a critical skill repertoire involving the production of stimulus sequences. Sequence production is a pre-academic skill relevant to the development of reading, spelling, numeric skills, and concepts, as well as everyday tasks like making a telephone call or operating a vending machine. Research supported by NIH has resulted in the development of techniques that can establish sequencing skills in our target population. These techniques, however, are not readily accessible to parents, professionals and the children who might benefit. This proposal aims to fill that gap by the development of a user-friendly software product for computer-assisted instruction. The basic task involves a form of constructed matching to sample: A sample stimulus is presented to the student, who then must select two or more individual stimuli (e.g., letters, numbers) from a pool to construct a multi-element stimulus complex (e.g., letter-by-letter, number-by-number) that is related to computer screen, and the student would then select the individual letters (S, H, etc.) from an array of letters displayed at the bottom of the screen. As each letter is selected, it moves by computer animation to a position below the picture, so that the student \"constructs\" the world \"SHIRT.\" The project has two major objectives First, we will adapt well-developed methods from laboratory and applied research for use by teachers, other child care professionals, and parents. Second, we will evaluate the product to determine that it can be used effectively in typical educational situations. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The product being developed and evaluated may have a significant impact on special education practice. As such, the product is potentially marketable to speech/language pathologists, special educators, psychologists, other professionals, and parents.",

Through the application of high-speed optical fabrication processes and hard material processing technologies the intention is to demonstrate that ALON is significantly less costly to fabricate into high-speed missile domesthan that of Sapphire.  The ideal replacement for Sapphire would be inexpensive to procure, easy and inexpensive to fabricate and still retain the excellent combination of optical and mechanical properties exhibited by Sapphire over the spectral rangerequired of a high-speed missile dome.  Of available candidate materials, ALON comes closest to this ideal.  ALON's properties are very similiar to those of Sapphire, yet ALON is transparent in it's polycrystalline form.  Therefore, ALON can be made bypowder processing techniques, in larger, more complex shapes and at a lower cost than Sapphire.  Furthermore, ALON's isotropic mechanical properties make it much easier and less expensive to polish using high-speed optical fabrication techniques than thean-isotropic Sapphire.

Having achieved proof ofconcept at atmospheric pressure with a small-scale prototype during Phase I, the proposed SBIR Phase II program will implement this innovative concept at full scale and full pressure by developing and fabricating a single catalytic injector module forengine condition test. The proposed technology targets gas turbine engine catalytic fuel nozzle design for reducing NOx from Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) engines.

The Phase I project has demonstrated a potential for reducing NOx by 50% and 90% from the present level for the JSF engines at maximum power and cruise conditions respectively with a low lean blow out limit.The primary markets for the specific catalytic injector technology proposed will be for military and commercial aircraft engines driven by pollution regulations and policies to have continued high performance with low emissions. The commercial potential isfavorable for the application of this technology and the market size is substantial.  Outfitting the Joint Strike Fighter fleet with the catalytic injector technology is worth in excess of $1 billion.   A potential spin-off of this technology forapplication in both heavy commercial jet and regional jet engine businesses, has substantial market sizes of $2.4 billion and $2.2 billion respectively.

The instrument willincorporate diode laser-based, full-spectrum Raman scattering for continuous in-situ remote monitoring of the composite and propellant chemistry.  Narrow well defined Raman peaks and lack of sample preparation requirement make Raman scattering well suitedfor in-situ analysis of composites and solid rocket propellants.   Raman spectroscopic analysis can be made via small (200 mm core), inert, silica/silica clad optical fibers.  One fiber is used for sample excitation via laser diode, and another fibercollects the Raman scattered light and carries the signal to a remote, portable spectrograph.   A semiconductor laser diode offers long life, can be very compact, and can operate at near-IR wavelengths where sample fluorescence is minimized while takingadvantage of the very sensitive and full-spectrum capabilities of silicon CCD array Raman spectrum detection.  Many optical fibers could be multiplexed to allow depth profiling of selected solid propellant regions such as bond line and areas adjacent tocasing liner.  Similar optical fibers could be cast into witness panels of propellant mixtures without damaging the surrounding propellant, liners, insulator, or case structure.  The Raman spectra will be used to monitor curing, migration of plasticisersand other contaminants, and other aging effects that could alter propellant chemistry.  If this techniques proves valuable, we will address  positioning similar optical sensor fibers directly into a rocket motor while the propellant is being cast.  Thiswould allow monitoring of propellant chemistry ensuring proper curing conditions and reduce excess cure time and rework.   Phase I results demonstrated the ability of Raman scattering to quickly identify the basic components used in polymer composites andsolid rocket propellants.  Phase II will demonstrate the ability of casting optical fibers into typical rocket motor propellant systems and using remote Raman scattering analysis to monitor real-time propellant chemistry and basic health characteristics.",

Overweight and obesity,      \n the second leading preventable cause of death, poses a major public health         \n challenge in that it increases the risk of chronic diseases, including coronary    \n heart disease, and all-cause mortality. Clinic-based programs for weight           \n management are costly and serve only a small percentage of individuals.            \n Population-based behavior change programs are needed to reach larger               \n percentages of at risk individuals more cost-effectively.

However, there is a lack of effective interventions for individuals who do not seek help or follow through with treatment referrals. We propose to fill this gap in services by developing and testing a Transtheoretical Model-based intervention that will be delivered proactively, on a population basis, to primary care patients who are experiencing symptoms of depression but are not currently involved in treatment. It is the first intervention for depression that is appropriate for individuals in all stages of change-not merely the minority who are prepared to take action. In Phase I of this Fast Track Initiative, the aims are to norm TTM measures, develop the TTM interventions, and determine the feasibility of this approach by assessing study recruitment rates and reactions to the intervention materials. Primary care patients who screen positive for mild to moderate depression and are not involved in treatment will complete surveys for measurement norming (n=100) or participate in a pilot-test of the intervention materials (n=50). If feasibility conditions are met, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial in Phase II to assess the efficacy of the expert system intervention for depression. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Depression is a costly illness for health care organizations, disability insurers, and employers because of increased health service utilization, disability claims, and lost productively among depressed individuals. An effective, low-cost expert system that can reduce the prevalence of depression on a population basis has significant commercial potential.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A major goal of HIV-1 research is the development of a new generation of antiretroviral agents that target novel stages of the viral replicative cycle. New agents are needed both to combat the growing incidence of HIV-1 strains that are broadly resistant to existing medications and to reduce the considerable toxicities associated with current therapies.  HIV- 1 entry comprises a cascade of sequential events that provide attractive targets for new therapies. The chemokine receptor CCR5 serves as a critical portal of HIV-1 entry by acting as a fusion coreceptor in conjunction with CD4, the primary receptor for HIV-1. CCR5 plays a central role in virus transmission and pathogenesis, but is dispensable for human health. Accordingly, CCR5-targeted therapies represent a promising new treatment modality.  PRO 140 (PA14) is a unique monoclonal antibody (mAb) to CCR5. The Phase I project demonstrated that PRO 140 broadly, potently, and durably suppresses HIV-1 replication both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, unlike other candidate CCR5 inhibitors, PRO 140 does not block CCR5's natural activity, suggesting that this agent may be exceptionally well tolerated. Because of this compelling therapeutic profile, the murine PRO 140 antibody was successfully humanized to enable repeat dosing in man.  The overall goals of the Phase II project are to explore the therapeutic potential of humanized PRO 140 in the best available preclinical models of HIV-1 infection, and concurrently to advance the molecule into human clinical testing.  The preclinical studies will examine the ability of humanized PRO 140 to broadly inhibit genetically diverse and multidrug-resistant HIV-1 isolates in vitro and to control established HIV-1 infection in vivo. Additional studies will explore the antibody's interaction with the immune system. The project also encompasses essential product development activities that culminate in the first-in-man clinical trial of this innovative new agent.  Success in the preclinical studies will be achieved by demonstrating that humanized PRO 140 both reproduces the compelling therapeutic profile of the parent mouse mAb and possesses superior pharmacology. Successful clinical outcomes are defined as favorable tolerability, pharmacology, and antiviral profiles in man. Favorable clinical outcomes would warrant expanded human trials designed to establish safe and effective dosing regimens, and ultimately to support FDA licensure of this new mode of therapy. Accordingly, this project will provide important milestones in development of a new class of viral entry inhibitors that target HIV-1 fusion coreceptors.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is an urgent need for new modes of HIV therapy. Current therapies for HIV infection target the viral enzymes protease and reverse transcriptase. However, these therapies typically fail to control HIV long-term due to the transmission and emergence of multidrug-resistant variants, In addition, these treatments are associated with often intolerable side effects, and thus most HIV-infected individuals eventually exhaust their therapeutic options.   \nHIV entry provides a promising target for a new generation of antiviral agents, and recent clinical trials have validated entry as a viable target for therapy. However, no orally available HIV entry inhibitor has entered advanced clinical testing.   \n  \nIn the Phase I project, we performed ultra-high throughput screening of 4 million drug-like combinatorial compounds using a novel virus-free assay that accurately models all stages of HIV entry, Several active compounds were discovered, and the most promising compound was demonstrated to be a nontoxic and specific HIV inhibitor that acts at the level of membrane fusion, This novel compound derives from a promising lead series that possesses drug-like properties, facile chemistry and promising structure-activity relationships.   \n  \nThe overall goal of this Phase II project is develop the lead series into a highly optimized compound that meets all criteria for human clinical testing as a new HIV therapy. The collaborative drug optimization program combines the medicinal and computational chemistry expertise of Pharmacopeia, Inc. with the antiviral and drug development expertise of Progenics Pharmaceuticals and our scientific collaborators at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. The project will employ an integrated and iterative process of synthesis and biological testing of more than 1000 compounds that are progressively optimized for antiviral potency, selectivity and drug-likeness. Additional studies wit1 establish the molecular determinants of HIV susceptibility to the compound. Lastly, the most highly optimized compounds will be tested for oral pharmacology and tolerability in animals in order to identify the agent that most warrants advancement into human clinical testing.   \n  \nSuccess in the Phase II project is defined as the development of a novel, orally available and well-tolerated compound that broadly inhibits HIV entry with nanomolar potency. Project success would lead to the preparation of clinical-grade material and regulatory documentation that would support human clinical testing of this new HIV therapy.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   \nSerious kidney disease, involving substantial impairment of function, affects approximately 3.5 million Americans. Quantitative measurement of regional and global renal perfusion can provide important diagnostic information in the evaluation of such patients. Despite an intense search within the research community for a suitable non-invasive method for such measurements, existing techniques have severe limitations including lack of quantification (MRI), dependence on highly skilled users (color Doppler) or inappropriateness for use in humans (radiolabeled microspheres). Although global kidney function can be assessed using clearance indicators, these techniques provide no direct perfusion information. With a suitable radioactive agent, PET imaging can provide absolute quantification of regional blood flow with excellent spatial resolution and can be applied conveniently in humans. We propose to employ the PET agent 62Cu-ETS for this unique renal application. This agent has a short 9.7minute physical half-life, permitting safe, repeated use in humans and can be nationally distributed through use of a PTI developed generator. In our Phase I studies, this agent has demonstrated uniquely high renal uptake in humans and also demonstrated linear uptake to very high renal flow levels in a pig model. The proposed Phase II work will involve refinement of the radiochemical process for clinical production of the 62Cu-ETS and the necessary work for submission of an Investigational New Drug Application. In addition we will continue our work in Phase I by validating the application of 62Cu-ETS for PET quantification of regional renal perfusion in a pig model of acute focal renal injury, as well as translating the model to 62Cu-ETS quantification of regional renal perfusion in humans. Given the strength of PET and the characteristics of the Cu-ETS tracer, this imaging procedure can provide an ideal non-invasive technique for absolute quantitative measurement of both regional and global renal blood flow with far-reaching benefits in patient management and diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dental composite restorative materials undergo shrinkage during their placement. When they are light-cured in a confined setting, the shrinkage they undergo generates stress at the bonded interface with the surrounding tooth structure. Often this stress is high enough to break the adhesive interface, causing a gap that leads to marginal staining, sensitivity and recurrent decay. This project will explore an alternative type of photo-initiator that can significantly reduce shrinkage stress. The new compound will be custom synthesized and its ability to initiate polymerization on a par with typical photo-initiator will be verified in a model composite using FTIR analysis. The polymerization stress of the model composite will be measured and compared with a composite containing typical photo-initiator. The in vitro wear resistance and fracture toughness of the composites containing novel initiator will be compared to composites containing typical initiator to ensure their clinical viability. Microleakage in class V restorations will be simulated in extracted human molars for the novel composites to demonstrate their superior marginal seal compared to a control composite. A composite that produces low polymerization stress would alleviate a long-standing problem in dentistry, with potential applications to other industries such as automobile and electronics manufacturing.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The objective of this research is to evaluate a computer-assisted, continuous method for measuring breathlessness during exercise. The method represents a new approach to obtain subjective ratings from patients exercising on a cycle ergometer or treadmill. Whereas the \"gold standard\" Borg scale for measuring breathlessness is employed in over one million patients per year, it is limited by the fact that each estimate occurs at a discrete point in time cued or signaled by the health professional, rather than when the patient senses a change in symptom intensity. Moreover, if the patient cannot verbalize a response (e.g., while breathing through a mouthpiece), the rating must be indicated on the scale by finger pointing. During exercise this can lead to uncertainty on the part of the clinician as to exactly where the patient is pointing. The continuous method for obtaining patient-initiated ratings is unencumbered by these limitations, while also providing a direct measure of the absolute threshold and peak of breathlessness. The software to obtain such ratings has been shown to be reliable, valid, and easy to use. Thus far, the method has been successfully applied in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The goal of Phase II is to evaluate the new methodology with a wider sample of adult patients afflicted with asthma, interstitial lung disease, respiratory muscle weakness, and pulmonary vascular disease, as well as with a group of children with asthma. Tests will also be conducted to investigate the responsiveness of the continuous method to track the effects of bronchodilator therapy and respiratory load. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION. The commercial goal is to replace the discrete scale with a computer-administered continuous method for measuring breathlessness during exercise. The product marketed in Phase III will be a computer software package that will be purchased by physicians, clinics and hospitals throughout the world.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator):  The prevalence of untreated moderate to severe pain may be as high as 25% in the United States. In order to measure the effectiveness of treatment, outcome measures of patient perceptions have become increasingly important in hospital and health settings. Questionnaires are the only instruments presently used to assess Quality of Life (QOL) from the standpoint of the patient. The objective of this Phase II application is to further develop a computerized judgment method, not based on a questionnaire format, allowing health professionals to quickly determine perceived QOL of patients entering a hospital or clinic for treatment. Patients use numerical visual analogue scales (NVAS) and adjust the length of bars on the computer screen to indicate satisfaction or dissatisfaction with overall QOL and with QOL for each of 20 variables. The approach is referred to as the \"Interactive Computer method for rating Quality of Life\" (ICQOL). The user actively creates a profile representing the positive or negative salience of variables such as health status, energy level, and home life. In Year 1 the method will be tested with a culturally diverse group of patients diagnosed with different types of pain. A Spanish version will also be tested. Results will be compared with the same patients' ratings of absolute pain intensity along a NVAS. In Year 2 the method will be compared with the commonly used SF-36 questionnaire to determine how well scores of QOL from both methods track relief from pain, as measured along a NVAS, before and after epidural steroid injection. The main advantages of this new assessment method are (a) quantitative interval scale measures are obtained, (b) ratings of items are given in the context of other items, (c) dynamic adjustments in ratings are possible, and (d) data collection and analysis is efficient and inexpensive. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION. The commercial goal is to replace paper-and-pencil surveys with a computer-administered method that allows dynamic ratings of QOL variables considered in the context of other variables. The software will be available for the two major computer platforms (Windows & Macintosh). As marketed in Phase III, physicians, pain clinics and hospitals throughout the world will purchase the computer software package.",

Such developments will result in a significant reduction in thetransmission of excess vibration and shock loads to helicopter and aircraft airframe. An effective isolation technology will have applications for isolating vibrations from guns, engines, and main rotor head transmission mounts in Army helicopters withemphasis on reducing the vibration to the airframe and onboard mission equipment package LRUs.  The goal is to increase the LRU MTBF and lower overall logistics cost.Vibration and shock attenuation is the focus of this project.  We offer to demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of the Smart Isolation Mounts for Army Guns (SIMAG) with Energy Flow-Controlling Structural Elements designs suitable for use inmilitary airborne vehicles such as helicopters, aircraft, and UAVs.  Excess vibration energies will be channeled and attenuated inside the proposed Smart Isolation Mounts whose continuous and connected elements will have energy flow-controlling andenergy-managing capabilities. It is the energy-managing and energy-controlling features of the SIMAG that makes our design unique and effective.  This innovative Smart isolation Mount will be designed to be effective and failsafe. The proposed mountcreates a barrier between vibration energy generated by guns, engines, and sensitive optical and electrical components onboard helicopters or aircraft. Vibration and shock disturbances injected into the mounts will be confined, diverted, converted,absorbed, steered, and dissipated using embedded passive, semi-active, and hybrid elements.  The semi-active feature of the proposed isolation mount will have the capability of changing it stiffness and/or damping rates in an on-off manner to accommodateoperational changes.     Effective isolation mounts have applications in the current commercial piston and turboprop aircraft as well as helicopters. The combination of improved vibration isolation while maintaining static alignment conditions under shockloads will also be applicable to better isolating a variety of military and commercial power trains from the rest of the vehicle.  In addition to airborne types, these vehicles include passenger automobiles, commercial trucks, marine vehicles such assubmarines and surface ships.",

Furthermore, the system will be flexible - not relying on any special setup or null optics specific to any aspheric shape and capable of measuring a wide range of aperture sizes.

The radiometer, which will combine state-of-the-art RF design techniques with novel processing algorithms, will operate near the 183 GHz water vapor line to provide the best means for measuring low levels of atmospheric water vapor.  Phase I investigated the optimal instrument configuration for measuring low levels of integrated water vapor and liquid water, as well as the ability to generate vertical profiles of water vapor.  In order to estimate these quantities, an artificial neural network algorithm, trained on data from the DOE Cloud and Radiation Test (CART) site in Barrow, Alaska, was developed.

        "abstract": "A high power electrochemical capacitor is proposed based on low cost carbon materials.  Currently, most commercial electrochemical capacitors use synthetic polymer precursors in the fabrication of activated carbon used in the electrode structures.  Thesematerials offer superior performance over the life of the capacitor.  The synthetic materials have high carbon purity, which leads to long life characteristics in the capacitor.  Lower cost non-synthetic precursors are considerably less expensive buttypically do not exhibit stable performance over the life of the device.  New and innovative manufacturing techniques for low cost precursors will be investigated that improve carbon purity. Currently, carbon constitutes 45% of the material costs inelectrochemical capacitors. The proposed improvements will reduce material cost by a factor of two.  This dramatic reduction in material expense will improve the competitiveness of this technology in relation to rechargeable batteries.   The developedmaterials will be integrated into high power electrode designs that will increase peak power performance by at least a factor of six. There is growing interest in the use of electrochemical energy storage systems during short-term power pulses. Commercialapplications include: regenerative braking in hybrid and electric vehicles, digital wireless telecommunication systems, and combustion engine starting applications.  The short output characteristics of these applications differ from the duty cycles thanare typically seen for conventional battery systems.  Electrochemical capacitor technology offers distinct advantages for these short pulse applications. They offer excellent reliability, cycle performance, and low temperature discharge characteristics.For many applications ranging from a faction of a second to 6 second pulses, an electrochemical capacitor offers a reduction in overall system size.  Currently, because of the high cost of materials used in these capacitors they do not offer an advantagein cost in comparison to other technologies. The proposed development program will help alleviate this issue by reducing carbon cost by a factor of two.",

In Phase II, the QSI-Lectromec team proposes to address the modeling, data analysis, architectural, implementation and deployment requirements identified in Phase I todevelop a solution consisting of four functional components: (i) a laboratory test-stand for analyzing bus failures, and for developing and validating failure models to be used in onboard and flight-line maintenance support equipment; (ii) flight-lineautomatic test equipment that incorporates functionality for interfacing with the aircraft bus network, monitoring operational bus performance via passive monitoring of communication traffic and/or excitation of the network using test signals; (iii)ground-based user-friendly software for managing maintenance activity data and supporting failure forecasting analysis; and (iv) onboard monitoring hardware for capturing and logging an enhanced set of bus performance parameters for post-flight download,analysis and initialization of ground-based troubleshooting and maintenance.  The Phase II prototype solution will be demonstrated on an aircraft platform identified with the Air Force's assistance.  Phase III commercialization of the product is expectedto lead to its integration in a larger aircraft wire integrity maintenance program.",

Free-space sensing has the ability to measure the electric potentials produced by the brain without contacting the head and sooffers the ultimate solution for long term monitoring of cognitive processes.

In addition, the sensors have a sufficiently small size, low weight and low cost to be used in a future wearable system that integrates the cognitivestate of an operator into a larger system.The Phase I program will investigate realizing these important capabilities in a practical high density sensor array for real time detection of cognitive state. A side by side comparison will be made between a set of the new sensors and a 64 element arrayof conventional electrodes.

Several of the devices were also successfully tested by respected XAFS experimenters at the Advanced Photon Source, and the devices have been enthusiastically received. At this point it is clear there is a significant commercial potential to our designs, even at the Phase I stage of development. We have been approached by a company with a world-wide sales presence in synchrotron radiation instrumentation who is interested in potentially marketing our analyzer technology, and particularly future integrated systems that we intend to develop. The market potential and utility for end-users will be significantly enhanced through development of turnkey systems incorporating positioners, back-end detectors, and alignment aids.  \n  \nIn this Phase II application we propose to carry our bent Laue x-ray analyzer concept through to commercial implementation, specifically to continue to improve the performance below 6 KeV, to develop integrated multielement systems, improve manufacturing, quality control, and quality assurance capabilities, develop user documentation, and form marketing and distribution agreement(s) with an established company or companies with a world-wide sales presence.

        "abstract": "A novel computational materials design approach is being applied to create a nanostructured high-strength, high-toughness stainless steel that meets the stringent mechanical properties for carrier-based aircraft components. Currently, the Navy uses AerMet100 for critical aerospace components. However, this alloy is non-stainless and highly susceptible to both corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement, which can lead to stress corrosion cracking. As a result, a number of aircraft components, such as landinggear, require a costly cadmium coating process to protect against corrosion. Cadmium, a known carcinogen, represents significant environmental risks in both primary manufacture and at DoD overhaul and repair facilities. During Phase I, threefirst-generation alloys were computationally designed, and prototype heats were ordered. The material properties will be characterized during the Phase I Option program. Under this proposed Phase II SBIR, two more generations of prototypes will bedesigned, produced and characterized. The lessons learned from these prototype alloys will be applied to produce and characterize a large-scale heat of the most promising alloy design. A new high-strength, high-toughness stainless alloy will benefit theenvironment and have dual-use application for the commercial aerospace market and other commercial markets such as marine equipment. The primary anticipated benefit of developing a unique structural stainless alloy for carrier-based aircraft componentswould be environmental. AerMet 100, the steel currently used for carrier-based aircraft components, is nonstainless and requires a costly cadmium coating process to protect against corrosion. Cadmium is a known carcinogen and represents significantenvironmental risks in both primary manufacture and at DoD overhaul and repair facilities. Eliminating this coating process has a tremendous potential for reducing long-term maintenance costs and eliminating environmentally hazardous processes.Furthermore, many of the major items that are cadmium plated, such as landing gear, are damage tolerant and sensitive to hydrogen embrittlement during maintenance and stress corrosion cracking during use. This sensitivity makes stress corrosion crackingthe primary failure mechanism for landing gear - a failure that often causes significant collateral damage to the aircraft, even though the failure usually takes place while it is parked. The Boeing Company has also provided a letter of support for thisproposed Phase II SBIR as the development of a high-strength, high-toughness stainless equivalent to AerMet 100 would have significant commercial aerospace potential.",

The proposed approach to the development of high gain, omnidirectional antennas is based on the two new design concepts developed in Phase I effort of theproject; cylindrical reflector and sectoral horn omnidirectional antennas which provide narrow elevation beamwidth, high gain, direction finding capabilities. The proposed omnidirectional antennas will provide enabling capabilities for the development of ship defense systems against oncoming missiles.  The proposed high gain omnidirectional antennas will provide not only the high probability of detection butalso direction finding capability.  High gain omnidirectional millimeter-wave antennas will have potential opportunities for wide rage of commercial and military applications.

The conclusion of the Phase Ieffort was that extinguishing the gas generator for the majority of the flight would eliminate the possibility of interaction of the thruster exhaust with the IR seeker.  In addition, we defined a control system based on flywheel attitude control that willprovide for the gas generator shut down and generate electrical power for future guidance system improvements such as active electrical power for future guidance system improvements such as active radar sensors.  Quoin demonstrated the feasibility of usingtwo flywheels to provide three-axis attitude control in a single degree of freedom demonstration.

STADIUM(SM) is a finite element model that can be used to follow thetransport of ions and liquids in reactive porous media. Over the recent years, the model has served to predict the degradation of unsaturated concrete structures exposed to chemically aggressive environments.The extended version of STADIUM will account for the following transport and degradation phenomena:-    Gas transport-  Cracking-       Reinforcing steel corrosion-    Delayed ettringite formationBy its unique structure (designed to take into account the occurrence of numerous, potentially coupled, deterioration phenomena), and its integration with state-of-the-art concrete forensics technology, this new model will be particularly well adapted tothe prediction of the performance of naval waterfront concrete structures. The toll paid for treatment or lost service due to destructive corrosion or other forms of concrete deterioration amounts to billions of dollars annually.  It is common for structures to require costly repairs after only 20 years in service.  This isparticularly problematic considering that actual design service life expectations for U.S. Navy structures are extending to 100 years.  The premature degradation of concrete structures jeopardizes Naval activities and therefore the readiness of the U.S.Navy.  This comprehensive modeling and forensics approach will help the Navy and other government agencies design structures for longer service life and evaluate remediation strategies with confidence and assured readiness.  The new durability softwarewill also be useful to designers of highways, bridges, water/waste treatment facilities, parking structures, and commercial and residential buildings.  It is anticipated that successful commercialization of this model and approach to condition assessmentwill result in a new industry generating at least $100 million per year in condition assessment and design revenues, and that it will revolutionize the military and construction industries' approach to procurement and remediation.",

        "abstract": "Conventional optical waveguide modulators failed to provide modulated output of circularly polarized light. In this program, Radiant Research, Inc. (RRI) proposes a miniaturized circular-polarization modulator (CPM) that operates at arbitrary modulationrates up to 100 GHz and at various optical wavelengths from 700 to 1600 nm. Specifically, the CPM will take the output of a laser diode and produce a free-space laser beam that alternates in time between left- and right-hand-circular states ofpolarization, without any moving parts. For BMDO, the CPM provides a source of polarization modulated light for remote sensing, scanned object detection in fog, and imaging polarimetry. Innovative is the use of electro-optic (E0) polymer prepared in a veryspecialized manner as developed by RRI. We anticipate that the specifications of the CPM will exceed those of any other compact integrated-optic device capable of controlling dynamically the polarization of a laser beam, which include good output-beamprofile, high-extinction polarization purity, low drive-power consumption, need for only low voltages, and use of only a single high-speed voltage source. The use of EQ polymer provides for mass manufacture at a cost lower than any other technology. Thecompelling nature of our technology has attracted $765,000 in matching funding.Anticipated Benefits/Potential Commercial Applications of the Research or Development.

This project will develop an inexpensive, high performance, modular, monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) for mass-producible, multi-channel spectral radiometry, applicable to microwave and millimeter wavebands.  Phase I constructed, tested, and demonstrated the low cost and high performance of a versatile receiver design.  Components required for the construction of a field-worthy, 183 GHz, water vapor profiling radiometer were identified.  An eigenvalue analysis was performed to determine a suitable frequency ensemble for profiling water vapor in wintertime Arctic climates.  Phase II will complete the design of the multi-channel, 183 GHz profiling radiometer and construct and test the instrument.  This testing will include environmental chamber testing to simulate harsh Arctic weather.    Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  Commercial applications should include low cost, robust, high performance radiometers for weather monitoring and prediction; remote sensing of snow, ice, sea surface, and soil moisture; lightweight and low power unmanned-aerial-vehicle sensor systems; and many other microwave and millimeter wave applications.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is the aim of the present Phase II research program to develop a continuous, noninvasive, on-line process for optically monitoring the levels of urea in a patient's blood during hemodialysis. The ultimate goal of such a process is to provide a direct and continuous measure of the efficiency of dialysis without having to wait for the drawing of a blood sample, thereby providing an assessment of whether dialysis at any point in time has reached an effective stopping point for the patient while still attached to the dialysis equipment. We propose to utilize low-resolution laser Raman scattering for the direct measurement of the urea levels in blood using the optical access provided by the dialysis tubing delivering the patient's blood to the dialyzer. Our Phase I SBIR results have shown that urea has a unique Raman spectroscopic signature in animal blood and can be identified and quantified against a whole blood background. Our Phase II program is designed to assess the capability of Raman to quantify the levels of urea in human blood samples with varying concentrations of urea present. After constructing a suitable multiple regression model for BUN, we will build out an appropriate low-resolution Raman module for attachment to a hemodialysis unit and expand the investigation to human blood analysis for BUN and URR during actual dialysis procedures in the clinical setting. If successful, a Raman measurement approach would allow, for the first time, real-time, direct and continuous monitoring of the progress of urea removal dudng the course of hemodialysis. This would permit more efficient timing of the dialysis procedure for the patient, as well as providing an ongoing readout of the effectiveness of the dialysis system during patient treatment. We anticipate that a commercially viable urea monitor might be produced rapidly, if the Phase II work is successful, by the adaptation for the clinical setting of the Company's present R-2001 Raman module for attachment by fiberoptic probe to existing renal dialysis equipment.",

To meet these requirements, PMA-264's TAMDA team is developing the TAM environmental sensor and accompanying TAMdecision aid.  The TAMDA project's goal is to significantly improve effectiveness and efficiency of an aircrew's on-station time in ASW prosecution across a wide-variety of dynamic environments.  Specific to this SBIR topic, TAMDA needs optimal bottom-lossinversion techniques, interface and communication solutions to the aircraft tactical avionics or TACCO station, and significant and varied TAM data.  Most significantly, TAMDA needs to demonstrate and quantify improvement in target detection and operatorefficiency.This Phase 2 effort proposes technical objectives to address the needs of the SBIR topic.  These include: finalization of a Bottom-Loss Study to determine optimal inversion techniques; integration of Environmentally Assisted Processor (EAP) algorithms anddisplays into RDA's Low-Cost Acoustic Processor; development and integration of a communication interface to the P-3's Tactical Computer for the injection of new tactical buoy patterns; and integration of HEP data into the TAM database for further studyand analysis. A number of benefits are anticipated from the work and efforts of this Phase 2 SBIR.  First, the Navy will receive a complete L-CAP prototype signal-processing suite enhanced with EAP echo classification signal processing and operatordisplays.  The hardware suite will show marked improvement to the detection and classification process beyond that gained from the improved tactical buoy pattern from the TAMDA system.  Second, communication will be improved within the airborne tacticaland sensor systems, and between the TSC and the aircraft, by the identification and implementation of an interface to the P-3 Tactical Computer.  This interface will facilitate the injection of TAMDA-improved tactical buoy deployment patterns.  Finally,the Navy will be provided with a complete TAM database into which HEP data from a variety of sites is integrated.  This database will be immensely useful to TAMDA and other Navy personnel in their study of potential Navy ASW environments.",

Of the fullerenes produced by the combustion process developed at TDA, and practiced at the tons/year scale, ca. 20 % of the raw soot weight is recovered as fullerenes (C60, C70, etc.).  It was shown in this project that another ca. 15 - 20% of the soot could be recovered as giant fullerenes using electron transfer methods. This Phase II project will further research the chemistry of the insoluble fullerenes and develop the recovery technique using xylene-extracted soot as a feedstock. We will also implement the process at 100 times the scale performed during the Phase I project, to 100g insoluble fullerenes recovered per shift, to better identify and address issues in the chemistry and engineering of the process. Following the Phase II project, the process will be installed at a plant producing ~32 tons/year of insoluble fullerenes.  \n\nThe process being developed in this project will be commercialized by fullerene soot producers, giving them the ability to effectively double the yield of the synthesis process.

Current methods that utilize epoxy adhesives provide limited strength and ballistic performance.  Reactive multilayer joining offers thenovel ability to form strong metallic joints between SiC tiles and Ti-6-4 plates, at room temperature and in air.  We have demonstrated this ability in our Phase I project, and we have also shown that the resulting joints have the desired shear strength of52 MPa, twice that of epoxy joints.In the proposed Phase II project we will refine the reactive joining process and demonstrate that arrays of SiC tiles can be bonded onto Ti-6-4 plates with the desired ballistic and physical properties.  Specifically, we will (1) optimize the reactivejoining process by varying the brazes on the Ti plates, the pressure applied during joining and the roughness of the braze surfaces; (2) establish the ballistic superiority of the reactive bonded SiC-Ti joints over current epoxy-based SiC-Ti joints; and(3) demonstrate that the reactively bonded SiC-Ti joints meet all the relevant military specifications for armor joining.The most direct benefit is the enhanced ballistic performance of SiC armor on Ti-6-4 military vehicles.  By doubling the bond strengthcompared to epoxy, dramatic improvements in ballistic performance are expected.  More generally, demonstrating and optimizing the ability to reactive join ceramics to metals will aid all armor mounting programs, including the mounting of alumina toaluminum.

The offerer demonstrated concept feasibility by implementing a core vision system module.  The work proposed herein advances the initial findings andbroadens the scope of the investigation.  The main research items include: the continuing design of the reference architecture; the creation of processes and metrics to support the practice of component-based programming; and the development of integratedtools to facilitate component design, implementation, and system integration.  The effort will culminate in a technology demonstration on two materiel handling testbeds.

Further integration of 3rd party software designtools such as UML and DOORS will lead to the ControlShell application framework being an attractive development tool for developers of automated unmanned systems.",

        "abstract": "With the reduction in cost of computers, and computer-generated imagery, the number of research driving simulators is rapidly increasing.  Driving simulators used for research, such as vehicle design, safety and comfort, present additional challengescompared to typical training simulators.  The simulator itself must frequently be modified to support the evaluation of in-vehicle hardware systems.  In addition the routes that the driver in the simulator follows and the vehicles and events that theyencounter are dependent on the research being performed.  Finally automotive research simulators typically have small research staffs to handle the development and performance of human factors research protocols and the related simulator modifications.Work during Phase I has demonstrated the feasibility of a simulator monitor and control system (SMAC) workstation that can give simulation centers a means to safely and effectively run laboratory based simulations in a cost-effective fashion.  During PhaseII, the SMAC system will be implemented and tested in TACOM's simulator environment.Successful development and deployment of an SMAC system will reduce costs and increase agility of ground vehicle research simulation centers.  Using the SMAC system, newvehicle designs can be rapidly integrated into the simulator and assessed using easily developed experimental and test protocols.  With the growing number of ground vehicle research simulators in the automotive sector, there is a number of potentialcommercial customers.",

        "abstract": "Many military systems use dangerous gases and we propose to develop sensors that will enable safer and more reliable gas handling systems.  In particular, for Army chemical lasers, we propose to develop a sensor to monitor the health of the fluorinepassivation layer.  Because fluorine reacts violently with metals, the passivation layer is essential for safe and reliable operation of chemical lasers.  This becomes particularly important if mobility is required.  Passivation layers are fragile and themechanical stresses of mobile operation increase the risks.  Our sensor will provide early warning of problems allowing the operator to take corrective action before either the laser hardware is damaged or gas leaks cause personnel injuries.Army solid-state lasers would also benefit.  The manufacture of solid-state lasers, like all semiconductors, requires ultra high vacuum systems with high purity gases including many highly reactive gases such as oxygen and fluorine.  Our in-line gas sensorwill help improve yield and reliability of semiconductor manufacture.The DoD has invested a great deal in gas laser research over several decades.  Improved gas handling is needed to reap the benefits of this investment.The use of dangerous and highly-reactive gases is necessary in many branches of the military as well asin many civilian industries.   For example, halogen gases, such as fluorine and chlorine are widely used in military and civilian laser systems. While safer, oxygen is also highly explosive and is required by all branches of the military, by NASA, and bycivilian industries including bio and pharmaceutical labs.  All of these would benefit from the improved gas handling sensing system that we propose.",

Thetools will be used to seed real-time software with software sneak circuits to counter known threats based upon predefined scenarios.

The physical channel may involve radio frequency interactions with hills, foliage, andbuildings.

Some propagation paths may simultaneously involve hills, foliage, and urban areas.  Forexample, a warfighter in an urban area may need to communicate with a command station located outside of the city.  These mixed path links involving both urban and rural terrain are beyond the capability of any existing physics-based propagation model.Currently available models, including those developed by Remcom Inc., are applicable to paths where both the transmitting and receiving antennas are located in an outdoor urban environment, or indoors, or in rural areas.  Development of fast and reliablemixed-path models will be an important part of the overall SBIR effort for development of the Wireless Communication Coverage Software (WC2S).  Also important will be the design and implementation of a computer graphical user interface (GUI) that allowsfor efficient user-control of input of important data affecting network planning.Remcom has already developed a commercial quality radio propagation model called Wireless InSite.  While a competitive product, improvements in its graphical display capability are needed.  It is also important to extend the capabilities of Wireless InSiteto include propagation prediction over irregular terrain with area coverage capability.

The term \"local control\" is important because our experience indicates that most organizations prefer to maintain the information in databases under their control and do not want to enter data more than once. In addition, especially faculty are concerned about privacy issues when personnel data is being maintained at a location other than the responsible organization. \n\nOur objective is to provide small and medium sized grantee organizations a comprehensive, inexpensive software solution for ERA that mirrors the more expensive \"build your own\", \"buy and revise\", or \"rent an ASP application\". It is understood that the mid size and smaller organizations provide less than 20% of the overall NIH applications, but more than 2,300 of these grantee organizations do submit and obtain funds from the NIH. This is a significant customer base and requires NIH, SBIR ERA Project to consider this solution. A low cost commercially available, off-the-shelf software solution is essential for the overall success of electronic research administration (ERA). \n\nRAMS will perform the necessary research and prototyping, working closely with NIH staff, to determine the best practices that will enhance its current ecGrant software application. The research and testing will include; Profile data stored locally and accessed by grantor; Registration process with the NIH Commons; Creation and electronic submission of a competing 398 application and non-competing continuation grant awards; Obtain status of applications and awards via ecGrant; and provide required data on inventions to Edison, all in a secure/authenticated session.",

We also, independently, successfully developed a plasma spheroidizing process toproduce a similar powder. (Figure 1 and Figure 2) RAI have completed some initial studies on consolidation using hydraulic pressure with metal dies at room temperature, experimented with vacuum plasma spraying, and begun direct hot isostatic pressing(D-HIP) to produce rods for mechanical testing samples. Agreements are in place to run trials and attempt the 3-D production of components using a laser additive manufacturing (LAM) process. The results of the Phase I SBIR point to a successful Phase IIdevelopment of near net shape components using a variety of advanced powder metallurgical (PM) techniques. We will offer several options with appropriate budgets for each method so that choices can be made as to which method(s) are most critical for earlydevelopment within the timeframe allotted by the SBIR process. Each method proposed will be useful in the cost reduction and manufacturing schedule reduction that is required for the SM-3 divert system, other DoD missile systems, and commercialcustomers.Rhenium Alloys, Inc. was founded in 1966 to develop powder metallurgical applications for rhenium. Our 35-year history in the development and sales of this key refractory metal has been well recorded. We have in place an organization of 39employees dedicated to the production and sales in the U.S. and internationally of PM rhenium products. Our distributors throughout the world have the key contacts to get the information out to our potential customers. We currently ship to every continentbut one, Antarctica, and our products are used there. We have, at this time, over 600 customers for our products. The response from potential customers for the spherical rhenium powder at the recent AIAA Joint Propulsion Conference in Huntsville, AL wasoverwhelming. We merely showed a few powder samples from our Phase I development and word of mouth about the development quickly spread. We are now processing orders for small test quantities as well as planning production expansion for product and yieldimprovements to meet the demand in the near future. Letters of commitment from Plasma Processes, Inc., Aeromet Corporation and others point to the demand for this key breakthrough in the processing of PM rhenium components.We will use every available method to announce the development of this new spherical rhenium powder to the world's scientists and engineers. Our home pages on the Internet with Thomas Register and Thomas Regional as well as our own at www.rhenium.com willfeature the new powder. Rhenium Alloys, Inc. is registered on the Central Contractor's Registry (CCR) and is an accredited government supplier. Our electronic commerce site at TPN is a value added network (VAN) and is approved for E-commerce by thegovernment. We will place ads in key technical publications such as Advanced Methods and Materials (ASM International), Powder Metallurgy International, and Thermal Spray Society Magazine. Brochures and direct-mail advertising will be used to market to keypotential customers in the thermal spray industry, propulsion industry, and key government installations that are developing high temperature applications. Several papers in collaboration with AeroMet Corporation, Plasma Processes, Inc., and RefracSystems, Inc. will be presented and published detailing the development of the powder as well as the near-net shape production methods made possible by its development. Our company will attend trade shows throughout the country to discuss the possibleapplications of SRMP. The technology developed during Phase II of this SBIR will be used for military, NASA, and commercial interests. This will generate considerable publicity as additional papers are written and published about the benefits of theseadvanced techniques. Key programs such as the SM-3 Navy Theater Wide missile defense system, SSTO, RLV, shuttle retro-rockets, satellite bi-propellant combustion chambers, and tactical missile throats/pintles will benefit from these developments. The AirForce/NASA/Commercial consortium working on IHPRPT will be able to run trials for the production of large, non-eroding throats for solid propellant launch vehicles. Initial conferences have been held to discuss additional funding and support for a PhaseIII effort with some of the IHPRPT materials development committee members. The initial programming of the computers at AeroMet Corporation has already begun and a large throat test unit in titanium has been produced as an example.Our initial projections for sales of SRMP are on the order of $200K in 2001 with 30-40% growth per year over the next 5 years. These figures may be a bit conservative based on the amount of support we have received for our Phase II effort and the commentsfrom potential customers. The market potential for spherical rhenium metal powder is in the millions of dollars over the next ten years.",

As shown in Phase I, the sensor plate can be used to accurately measure the first (N1) and second (N2) normal stress differences, which are important nonlinear elastic flow properties of various classes of viscoelastic liquids.  In Phase II, sensor packaging and lead transfer to the sensors will be made suitable for high volume, high quality manufacturing of sensor plates.  One version will be optimized for measurements at lower pressures and another version optimized for measurements on molten commercial thermoplastics at higher temperatures and pressures. The latter version of the sensor plate will be smaller in diameter to make possible measurements on smaller samples at higher shear rates, and will contain miniature temperature sensors that will enable accurate compensation for changes in sensor calibration constant with temperature.   Improvements will be tested with a wide variety of commercial polymer systems and other important classes of viscoelastic liquids. \n\nThis novel sensor plate will meet the critical market need for an inexpensive instrument for fully characterizing shear flow properties of molten thermoplastics.  The competing alternative technology, the force rebalance transducer (FRT) is expensive and works best with large samples.  It is simpler/less expensive to adapt a sensor plate rather than a transducer to existing rheometers.  Hence the sensor plate has significant commercial potential to satisfy pent-up demand for an inexpensive way to upgrade rheometers to allow flow elasticity measurements.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase 2 project looks to develop and further refine the culture conditions to optimize the growth of juvenile green sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis), a commercial species not previously cultured as juveniles.  We will develop an alternative technology for the New England fishery which now depends only on the harvest of wild urchins.  Sea urchin roe is a delicacy in Japan that is the basis of a 250 million+ dollar fishery.  Overfishing has devastated natural populations. To date, research and development of sea urchin aquaculture has had two foci: hatchery development, in which we at the Peacock hatchery have played a pivotal role, and roe enhancement of adults.  These are certainly two very important stages of the life cycle of sea urchins.  However, without bridging them through growout of juvenile sea urchins, sea urchin aquaculture will not become a reality.  In Phase 2 of this project we will determine if diet affects the growth and mortality of grow-out of juvenile sea urchins to adult.    We will also investigate if diet quality affects gonad development and roe quality in adults.  We will also determine if land-based or near-shore grow-out of juvenile sea urchins is more cost-effective.",

We have demonstrated in the Phase I effort that the optimal choice of a filter optical element is a thick volume holographicdiffraction grating written into MEMPLEXr, a photopolymeric material.    Numerous systems currently under development by all departments within the DOD  involve detection of weak optical signals in the presence of significant unwanted background noise suchas solar radiation.  These systems are being applied in arenas such as astronomical observation, which utilizes passive systems to detect plasma emissions, and active systems for observing specific excitations, as in gravity wave detection of sodium lines.Another area of application is light detection and ranging (LIDAR) which is used to detect everything from cloud formations and airborne objects to underwater objects such as mines and submarines.  The signal-to-noise ratio in these systems is directlyproportional to the transmission of a bandpass optical filter and inversely proportional to the filter linewidth.  A narrow linewidth, high efficiency optical filter would greatly enhance the performance of all types of these systems.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   \nEpistaxis, otherwise known as nosebleed, is a common occurrence that typically responds to home treatment. Some cases, however, do not respond and these patients require emergency room treatment. In severe cases, hospital admittance and intensive care are necessary. Several methods of treatment have evolved: gauze packing, balloon, and desiccated sponge packs. Each strategy has strengths and weaknesses. Gauze packing decreases blood oxygen levels and is extremely painful, requiring administration of narcotics. Nasal balloons resist conformation to the intricacies of the nasal cavity. Desiccated sponges are solid and immalleable during insertion, often damaging the nasal mucosa. RBDC developed and tested the Pillow Pac on an anatomical model in Phase I. The Pillow Pac has a soft PVC tube base for easy insertion and removal with two thin, soft plastic bags mounted on top of the tube. Once inserted the bags are inflated to create sufficient pressure to stop the bleed. The soft bags work into the various crevices, create even pressure, inserts easily, and deflates for easy removal. RBDC proposes to complete technical development based on data obtained in Phase I. If the device proves viable in a model, safety and efficacy studies will be conducted.",

The antenna system will operate at a broad bandwidth from 8 to 40 GHzwithout the need for switching and reconfiguration and will support the high data rate (>500 MBPS) transmission. A small 4 x 4 phased array antenna system will be produced to demonstrate the technology effectiveness. The proposed phased array design isbased on the multi-functional RF antenna elements realized by the integration of multi-band T/R modules and wide-band planar (Vivaldi) antenna elements. New developments will be emphasized in the areas of low loss diplexer development, wide-bandtransmitter modules, power and low noise amplifiers, low loss wide-band phase shifters, beam steering controller, input/output interfaces, low frequency electronics, complete data-in-data-out system and system analysis. The new T/R modules will transmit at10, 19, and 32 GHz frequency ranges and will receive at 12, 21, and 35 GHz frequency ranges, simultaneously. A small prototype antenna system will be integrated with the high-speed data interface modules to demonstrate the full duplex end-to-endcommunication system. This prototype phased array will form a building block for large high capacity antennas for the air platforms. Main features of this technology are multi-band performance, low power dissipation and low cost beam steering, theextension of which to a broadband phased array radar system will also be undertaken.",

        "abstract": "Ambient particulate matter (PM) mass exposure is determined by collecting the PM on a sample filter over a period of 24 hours.  Because the composition of ambient PM is constantly changing, the PM mass measured using the reference method may not be representative of the PM levels in the atmosphere, primarily due to the loss of collected semi-volatile material that is present in the atmosphere during the collection period.  In addition, by obtaining a single value over a 24-hour period, the method may not properly recognize the true exposure risks that occur during short term spikes in the ambient PM levels.\n\nRupprecht & Patashnick Co., Inc. (R&P) proposes to resolve these issues through the use of an innovative advance to their popular TEOM\u00c2\u00bf Ambient Particulate Monitor.  The TEOM\u00c2\u00bf mass monitor is a filter-based, inertial micro-balance that provides direct mass measurements of the collected material in near real time.  The innovation, the Differential TEOM\u00c2\u00bf System, is a self-referencing system that utilizes an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) to periodically remove the ambient PM from the sample stream to allow the system to measure sampling artifacts caused by the presence of semi-volatile compounds such as ammonium nitrate or semi-volatile organics. \n\nThe Phase I research project compared the results obtained using the initial prototype Differential TEOM\u00c2\u00bf monitor operating at ambient temperature with results from an early test Differential TEOM\u00c2\u00bf monitor operating at a fixed control temperature and with reference method results, with all samples collected at R&P\u00c2\u00bfs facilities in Albany, NY.  The real-time comparison showed that the performance of the ambient Differential TEOM\u00c2\u00bf monitor accurately reflects the mass concentration measured using the other sample methods.\n\nThe work proposed for the Phase II research project is to deploy and optimize four prototype Differential TEOM\u00c2\u00bf monitors to collect PM10 and PM2.5 mass over a 12-month period, permitting the evaluation of the instruments over multiple seasons.  The units will operate at ambient temperature, providing a measure of the ambient PM mass as it exists in the atmosphere at the time of collection.  The instruments will be co-located, allowing precision determination, and the results will be compared to measurements obtained using other PM sampling equipment, including the current reference method and speciation monitors.  Results obtained to date suggest that the Differential TEOM\u00c2\u00bf could be used as a new reference standard for ambient particulate matter mass measurements by accounting for the presence of semi-volatile compounds.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with epilepsy often suffer from cognitive impairments. Seizure control can improve cognitive status; yet the anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) often used for this purpose can themselves affect mental function. Thus, defining an effective treatment for an individual patient often requires balancing seizure control with potential medication side effects. While efficacy for seizure control is relatively easy for the clinician to gauge, currently there is no efficient objective measure of brain function used to assess changes in cognitive status during treatment. We propose to develop a specialized system, the Ant epileptic Neurotoxicity Test (ANT), to address this need. Our prior research suggests that sensitive indices of attention and memory can be derived from multivariate combinations of EEG, ERP and behavioral performance measures. During Phase I we demonstrated that such methods are sensitive to both acute dosing with older generation medications, and to the cognitive side effects of chronic dosing with newer AEDs. Progress was also made on the design and implementation of an automated clinical testing system that the ANT would be based on, and on defining modifications to signal processing algorithms to accommodate abnormal EEGs. In Phase II our methods will be extended and a prototype ANT will be implemented and validated in collaborative studies with epilepsy specialists. A resulting first generation ANT will enable research on the neurocognitive changes associated with epilepsy treatments, providing an efficient, standardized means to measure cognitive brain function across different laboratories and clinics. With refinement, the system could improve patient care, for example by helping a physician to select the best drug and dose level for an individual patient. There is a significant market demand for such a device in the context of epileptology, and related products could find widespread use as assessment tools in many areas of neurology and psychiatry.",

Focus will be on proving out the power converter material and assembly system in an demonstration system that could bemodified for test in an application that of interest to both the Military and Commercial automotive industry.  The technology will be of broad interest in motor drives for HEV's and other applications such as distributed power generation.There are a largenumber of Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) programs ongoing at this time and many of them require DC-DC converters to mediate power between sub systems.   This situation is not expected to change in the near future since basic material physics drives thisrequirment.   Consequently there is a large potential market for high power DC-DC Converters in the vehicular market and another one in distributed generation.  SatCon Technology Corporation works with military and civilian automotive companies buildingarmored vehicles, trucks, bus's and automobiles and has experience meeting their rigorous cost and performance goals.  With a market need and customers SatCon has an opportunity to create a product line that can be commercially viable.  The Modular HighPower Density Vehicular DC-DC Conbverter (MVDC) developed in this program would be a building block product that can meet the needs of many customers, lowering their development and acquisition costs.  A small family of MVDC blocks with various input andoutput voltage levels would be developed to meet the widest possible set of customer expectations.  Due to its modular nature and clean interfaces MVDC is naturally upgradeable as better technologies evolve.   SatCon would team with other companies todevelop, build and deploy the MVDC.   This program has the requirements for a successful commercial takeoff; an expanding market and a new product with compelling advantages supported by a company willing to take it to the market.",

The Global Hawk unmanned reconnaissance aircraft currently houses a 48-inch Ku-band satellite communications antenna.  Schafer's Phase II objective is todemonstrate the feasibility of high structural efficiency Silicon Lightweight Mirrors (SLMS), a novel, athermal, all-silicon, foam-core, lightweight mirror technology, for Optical/RF Communications Antennas for the Global Hawk system.  We will performdesign and analysis of a 48-inch antenna for operation in Ku-band, Ka-band and at 1.55 microns.  We will produce a flight-worthy 50 cm aperture pathfinder antenna suitable for verification testing at AFRL.  The surface figure error specification andsurface roughness for the antenna are driven by the 1.55 micron laser wavelength.  Unlike silicon carbide mirrors, silicon-based SLMS are quickly and inexpensively polished to low surface error and roughness.  SLMS also have lower weight and cost thanUltralow Expansion (ULE) glass mirrors.  The athermal nature of SLMS make them ideal for operation in the high-altitude aerospace environment.SLMS technology will significantly impact and benefit a very broad set of future DoD (Communications, Directed Energy, Imaging) and DoC/NOAA (Remote Imaging) Missions.  SLMS will provide a national benefit beyond DoD for the NASA Space Science Enterprise(e.g., Explorer Program) and Earth Science Enterprise (e.g., GOES-R) and commercial system houses (L3 Communications, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, ITT, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, et.al.).",

        "abstract": "As computer workstations continue to increase in the ability to display more information, the necessity for an intuitive Command and Control (C2) display becomes paramount.  Interaction efficiency is critical to avoid operator fatigue and minimize operatorerror rates that could cost lives.  In emerging C2 systems and concepts, the user typically acts as a manager by exception while the majority of system activity is computer automated.  While direct interaction of the user with the system is minimal, aninaccurate action by the user can have catastrophic consequences. There is clearly a need for decision aiding systems in C2 Displays.  This effort demonstrates the use of human engineered intelligent tools to satisfy this need.  An intelligent tool is aprocess that acts as an assistant to the user by displaying suggested actions.  However, the method of displaying information directly affects the action taken by an operator.  The actions taken by an operator may be erroneous if the decision aidingdisplay method is not compatible with the cognitive functions of the operator.  Without the appropriate incorporation of Human Factors Engineering integrated into a decision aiding display, the most sophisticated intelligent algorithm is useless.",

Current spacelift isexpensive; e.g., it costs roughly $15M to launch a 1,000-lb satellite to Low Earth Orbit, or $15,000 per lb of spacecraft weight.  Small satellite potential is hindered by the lack of affordable and reliable spacelift.  A Small Launch Vehicle (SLV) usinginnovative propulsion and structural technologies is proposed to meet this need. In Phase I, flexibility of the booster engine cycle resulted in 30% increase in payload by substituting AFRL advanced hydrocarbon (AHC) fuels instead of RP-1. A study of thehistorical stage mass fraction resulted in conservative assumptions for both booster and upper stage thus, enabling even higher payloads for the SLV.Since engine development has historically been the highest technical and schedule risk to a launch vehicle program, a thrust chamber assembly (TCA) risk mitigation program is proposed in the Phase II and accompanying options to analyze, design, andfabricate 155,000-lb TCA for development using AFRL advanced AHC fuels.

The Phase I results showed that Ocellus Technologies designwould meet system requirements and could also be scaled and sized for larger or smaller Navy applications.The primary objective under the Phase II effort will be the construction of a prototype capacitor assembly for the LELFAS system.  Activities to be performed under the Phase II effort includes: capacitor cell scaling to the larger LELFAS sizes; assemblyand testing tooling development; power electronic interface development; and prototype assembly and testing.  Options under the Phase II effort will address further prototype design refinements including environmental performance, power electronics, andupdating of assembly tooling.

This concept is based on SARA's proprietary windscreen design, which have provided in excess of 15dB of noise reduction for analogous applications.

The device that demonstrated 10 to 25 dB improvement in the laboratory during Phase I will be demonstrated on moving ground vehicles in Phase II.Reductionof flow noise would greatly extend the range for acoustic detection. The 10 to 25 dB improvement observed in Phase I testing would yield detection by a factor of 3 to 10 if realized in Phase II.

A potential solution to this critical logistics problem would be to employ an Ocean Wave Energy Conversion (OWEC) system that could be rapidly deployed offshore.  However, OWEC systemshave traditionally been moored in fairly shallow water near the shore, or have been at the shoreline.  In addition, most of the traditional OWEC devices have been large, bulky, expensive, and would be very difficult to deploy in an Expeditionary Warfarescenario.  This project will demonstrate that an efficient, compact, deployable OWEC system can be effectively moored in any water depth, using a ship of opportunity for deployment. The proposed technology has numerous commercial and military applications,with the nearest-term being provision of electric power at remote ocean and coastal locations. In contrast to existing ocean-wave power conversion alternatives, this new approach offers the promise of a highly-compact, rapidly deployable, highly-efficient,reliable, and low-cost solution.",

        "abstract": "Nonlinear Optical (NLO) crystals play a critical role in current solid-state laser systems operating at fixed UV or visible wavelengths, and as tunable frequency converters known as Optical Parametric Oscillators (OPOs).  Currently, NLO materials limit theavailable wavelengths, as well as the longevity and efficiency of these laser systems due to low damage thresholds, poor optical quality, and small nonlinearities.  As a result, new NLO crystals that can improve the performance of solid-state laser systemsand provide new combinations of optical and mechanical properties are needed.  Specifically, there is a need for new NLO crystals for use in high efficiency all solid-state lasers operating in the UV.  Borate-huntite compositions, such as YAl3(BO3)4 (YAB),have been shown to have modest birefringence, large nonlinearities, and large damage thresholds making them ideal for NLO and OPO applications.  However, most borate-huntite compositions melt incongruently and must be grown from high temperature solutions.Crystals of a borate-huntite composition will be produced under this Phase II project that have been demonstrated to melt congruently.  Crystals that can be grown from a congruent melt are generally more robust, possess better optical properties and can begrown easily relative to the solution grown crystals.",

It also covers other important IA issues such as network reliability, network availability, long-termmaintainability, and the integration with the DoD's strategic backbones and tactical Intranets.  Finally, SRC's modular open system architecture is based on industry standards, uses common hardware and software, and also provides a dynamically-configurablemicrosensor network with improved information assurance that can continuously evolve as new technologies emerge.  The ability of multimode sensors (or collections of single-mode sensors) to detect adversarial movement/spoofing of the deployed microsensorsis a key technology that will be demonstrated during this proposed Phase 2 effort.

However, the majority of current ionosonde instruments suffer from hardware and operational shortcomings that limit their quality of their data, and hence the accuracy of the characterizations.  Recently, it hasbeen shown that some of these errors can be resolved by reinterpretation the data, but often the hardware limits the effectiveness, in terms of both cost and success, of this approach.A high frequency radar design is near completion that addresses the key hardware weaknesses of the current ionosonde designs.  The gain in performance comes from the convergence of high-speed digital tools and techniques that are used in a fully digitaldesign of the low power portions of the system.  Digital detection allows full utilization of the signal returns, as well as providing solutions to the spectral issues that normally limit ionosonde performance.

In Phase-I we have provided proof-of-principle for the proposed approach of reading a DNA microarray produced directly on the surface of a computer diskette. With this approach, a modified disk drive of a personal computer can be used as a reader device. Potential applications of this new technology can include: (1) Creating new diagnostic classifications based on gene expression; (2) Discovery of signaling pathways and new targets of therapy; (3) Developing new markers of diseases; (4) Monitoring of treatment response and selection of the most appropriate therapy.  \n  \nDuring Phase II, we will produce a commercial prototype of the Magnetic Array System and, after careful evaluation and validation in Phase-II, we will make this system available for commercial production in Phase III. The objectives in Phase II will be achieved through the specific aims established as following: (1) The Magnetic Array System will be optimized by upgrading Array Reader Electronics; by developing a methodology for automated data filtering and quantitative characterization of the quality of the microarray data; and by introducing 3D-linker technology for producing high-performance microarrays in a format compatible with the magnetic array reader. (2) Microarray processing protocols will be finalized and a pilot production of the focused microarrays will be established for applications in cancer research. (3) The performance of the prototype of the Magnetic Array System will be evaluated through collaboration with research groups in academic institutions.  \n  \nFor successful completion of Phase-II, Sci-Tec Inc. has established collaboration with academic institutions and businesses including the Material Analysis Center at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the Medical Center of the University of Tennessee, the E.O.

        "abstract": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: Traditional farm families are capturing value-added dollars in goat milk by making soap on a small scale. Yet volume production possible from even a small herd greatly exceeds what a farm family can comfortably, efficiently and physically produce in a household kitchen. These families must juggle demands of milk production and farm - caring for animals, maintaining buildings, providing grain, meeting equipment costs, providing veterinary care, producing other crops. Goat milk soap-makers must also meet production and marketing expenses. Operating the two enterprises can become as complicated and difficult as working off-farm. Producing a high quality, value-added product and tapping solid markets attuned to specific characteristics pose additional challenges for farm families. Major commercial soap manufacturers have started producing their own lines of \"natural\" products. Soap-making with natural ingredients, including purchased goat milk, has also become a cottage industry and popular pastime with the general public. How can farmstead producers effectively compete, adapt their products to market changes, and successfully sell their goat milk soap? This project develops a farmstead production and marketing model that achieves a profitable scale of income from goat milk soap to help sustain a family farm and promote the well-being of traditional farms. It tests feasibility, production and market potential of a producer and marketing cooperative and a training guild of dairy goat milk soap-makers toward effective function without government assistance.",

This project will develop a tool suite with the capability to take multi-source data (e.g., CADRG, CIB, JFIF/JPEG, DTED,feature data, mission data, weather data...) and rapidly produce a coherent real-time 3-Dimensional color and/or monochrome visual image that can be used by mission rehearsal systems and crew-in-the-loop simulators, with a specifiable field of view.  Thesetools will include an OpenGL runtime engine that will be capable of displaying the data on any workstation or PC, and run real-time given the appropriate graphic accelerator.  Develop a deployable tool that will take 1600 square mile high-resolution sampleCIB, feature data and DTED data and merge it into a common database within 30 minutes.  Develop a production visual node that will display the database in real-time.  This node will be capable of being networked with an infinite number of nodes, eachcapable of displaying a segment of a scene.  Networked nodes will be capable of producing a 360\u00c2\u00bf by 360\u00c2\u00bf display system.  Develop an embedded Rendering Engine that will allow Handheld and/or Pocket PC based systems to view the visual database.",

        "abstract": "70302S02-II     Microalgae technologies that produce renewable fuels and utilize the CO2 from power plant flue gases are one potential approach to the mitigation of greenhouse gases.  However, to be useful, high solar energy conversion efficiencies by large-scale algal mass cultures will be required.  This project will develop a biotechnological approach that combines mass culture optimization with superior algal strains to achieve the very high productivities required.  The selected strains will be combined with improved pond operating conditions to result in very-high-yield mass cultures able to utilize large amounts of CO2 and to produce biofuels and higher value co-products.  In Phase I, three different microalgae production systems \u00c2\u00bf open shallow raceway ponds, vertical circular tanks and tubes, and a flat-plate closed photobioreactor-were operated with marine algal species.  There were no unexpected productivity differences between these photobioreactors.  The vertical systems had a higher productivity per unit of intercepted light (photosynthetic efficiency), but the ponds had an overall higher productivity per unit of land area covered.  Surprisingly, partially covered open ponds also exhibited high photosynthetic efficiencies, suggesting that productivities are limited not only by light saturation but also by photoinhibition.   The results of Phase I suggest that mutant strains with reduced \"light harvesting\" chlorophyll would be much more productive in mass cultures than the normal (parental or \"wild-type\") strains.  Therefore, in Phase II, such mutants will be developed and tested in outdoor pond and photobioreactor systems to demonstrate the potential for high productivities (100 metric tons/hectare-year and above).    Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The immediate applications of this process should be in marine microalgae mass cultures that combine biomass production for conversion to biofuels and greenhouse gas abatement with higher-value co-products, such as animal feeds.  More broadly, the high-productivity microalgae processes also should be applicable in wastewater treatment, agricultural nutrient recycling and biofertilizers, and commodity chemicals and feed production.",

Unlike a bipolar junction transistor (BJT), the SIT is a majority carrier device, isvoltage-controlled, and often gives higher breakdown voltage and input impedance. While most SIT development has occurred in Si, renewed interest in the use of SiC SIT's over the past 10 years has occurred because of SiC's superior material properties.  Byuse of SiC, it is possible to increase the voltage (and thus power) rating of high-frequency amplifiers, and increase the power density by a factor of 4 to 10 in UHF to S-band transistors.In this SBIR phase II project, a new SiC SIT for L-band power applications will be created. Submicron dimensions needed to get useful gain in L- and S-band will be obtained by use a self-aligned process, which employs the same mask for the source fingerdefinition, source contact, and formation of the gate.The proposed SiC SIT will incorporate a self-aligned process which will provide significant improvement in yield and device performance. L-band power applications will benefit from a SiC SIT because of the higher power density, higher operating voltage andhigher projected operating temperature of SiC devices.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop high quality dielectric films and structures for a family of ultrasonic transducers for medical imaging applications.  The technology and methods developed in Phase I to characterize charge-trapping behavior of dielectrics are the critical innovations required to take micro-fabricated ultrasonic transducers from their current state to a commercially viable state.  Charge trapping created by the high electric fields in the device is detrimental to transducer performance.   Charge trapping is dependent on field polarity and causes shifts in electromechanical conversion efficiency in time.   Variations in charge trapping within a transducer array are even more disruptive.  A process that removes the polarity dependence of charge trapping and thereby enables a new type of bipolar ultrasound imaging array that improves image quality will be developed.  Since performance and reliability are critical to successful commercialization of these ultrasound probes, the issues of how dielectric charging causes time-dependent loss in performance and material degradation that could limit lifetime will be researched.  \n \nThe development and commercialization of micro-fabricated ultrasound transducers (MUT) is targeted at the medical applications market.  This work will also enable the development of ultrasound probes that can non-invasively provide more accurate diagnostic information for doctors, such as improved ability to distinguish between cancerous and benign tissue.  The image quality to price ratio drives market share in the global $3Billion diagnostic ultrasound market.   These novel ultrasonic transducers will significantly improve the image quality/price ratio, and thus realistically create market share swings of 5% upon product release.   Specifically, in the  $1Billion mid-to-premium segment of the radiology market most relevant to the proposed research, $50M of annual system sales would be generated by the introduction of MUT probes, of which approximately one third are direct probe sales.",

Although advances have greatly enhanced performance,improvement of polyamide membrane stability to oxidizing agents such as chlorine and reduced fouling are required to increase membrane life and reduce costs.  Recently, a new polyamide membrane (CPTC) has shown promise by displaying resistance to chlorinein laboratory immersion tests.  The contact time was 30,000 mg/L-hr, (~6-8 years) of exposure at the 0.5 mg/L level.  However, in actual long-term field testing (~2000 hours) on chlorinated waters, the CPTC membranes showed unacceptable performance lossesconsistent with with physicochemical damage and/or biological attack.  Work will continue on the CPTC membrane system to identify and resolve this problem.  In addition, the pursuit for a low fouling chlorine-resistant membrane will continue by improvingthe understanding of the mechanism of membrane chlorination reactions and associated performance losses.  New amine and acid chloride monomers will be synthesized, with the assistance of molecular modeling, to block chlorination sites that are subject toattack and to add low fouling moieties into the polyamide desalination barrier.   The total worldwide market for ROWPU-type RO spiral-wound elements, for both military and the private sector, is in excess of $200 million/year.  Approximately 75% of thistotal is produced by U.S. companies.  Since most membrane manufacturers are U.S. based companies, any product improvement will further strengthen their position in both domestic and overseas markets.  The potential use of the proposed membrane improvementsby the Federal government should provide considerable cost savings in element replacement as well as provide increased efficiency in system operation due to minimized fouling and less frequent need for cleaning.  Since ROWPU membrane elements are purchasedin large quantities, dertimental effects of long term storage also will be minimized.  U.S. membrane companies will benefit in the same manner as the Federal Government, although possibly to a greater extent, since the largest part of their market is inthe private sector.",

The claims to be sought are that the test will diagnose TB caused by either Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) or M. bovis in macaque and saimiri species of primates, and that the test does not give false positive results due to infections/exposures to M. avium/intracellulare, M. kansasii, M. gordonae, or M. scrofulaceum. To the extent possible, sera from naturally infected animals will used to estimate sensitivity and specificity. Experimental infections will be conducted as needed to provide the data required by the USDA.  \n  \nThe resulting test is expected to have advantages over the present tuberculin skin test in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and operational simplicity. Many individuals and entities involved in the management of nonhuman primate colonies, including the Association of Primate Veterinarians, the NIH National Center for Research Resources, and the Centers for Disease Control have called for the development of a better, more reliable test for TB in nonhuman primates, and it has been termed an \"urgent need\" by the NIH SBIR program.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase-II Proposal to the Office of Naval Research is for the development of a cloud droplet studies instrument. The instrument is based on laser diffraction principles wherein small-angle forward scattering by a droplet/particle is closelyrepresented by diffraction through an aperture of equal diameter. The instrument that we propose here is unique in that it covers a wider range of sizes than any prior technology instrument, and the size bins are equally spaced in log-space. Furthermore,the design simplifies the electronics and optics so that the core instrument is expected to weigh less than 1 pound. This core instrument will be encased in a streamlined pod for installation beneath aircraft wings. Data storage can be on-board theinstrument electronics, and/or at a remote computer within the aircraft (naturally, the former is preferred). In the Phase-I final report, we note completion of all tasks proposed in the Phase-I project. In this Phase-II, we shall develop a fully capableprototype, and do initial flight testing. In the ensuing period, extensive in-flight test and data collection is proposed. Cloud dynamics remains the single biggest uncertainly in global climate modeling. The measurement of clouds, including the clouddroplet size distribution and liquid water content are essential to furthering understanding of climate dynamics. The present sensor system replaces poorer and more expensive prior systems. This system will be extensively used not only in climate research,but also is applicable in other weather phenomena such as hurricanes, dust clouds and storms, atmospheric visibility, etc.",

Particularly attractive are two-step therapies that initially deliver relatively non-toxic \u00c2\u00bfprodrugs\u00c2\u00bf that are subsequently activated at the sites of angiogenesis.  This project will develop a two-step therapy that relies on the targeted delivery of non-toxic boron-10 (10B) to the tumor vasculature.  When the site is irradiated with low-energy neutrons, they will be captured by the 10B atoms, which will undergo nuclear fission and yield high-energy products that destroy cells.  Phase I constructed and tested in vitro assembled nanovehicles for boron-10 delivery.  These nanovehicles carried a high capacity polymeric carrier for boron-10 that allows a \u00c2\u00bfloading\u00c2\u00bf of 1120 boron atoms per every targeted molecule.  The assembled nanovehicles were shown to be non-toxic, capable of binding to cellular receptors of vascular endothelial growth factor, and internalized by targeted cells.  Phase II will test assembled targeted nanovehicles in animal tumor models.  Novel, high capacity assembled nanovehicles will be constructed that combine imaging and therapeutic capabilities.

However, with the ever-growing availability of asynchronous sensors, the use of batch mode is becoming technically obsolete. New systems capable of synergistic integration with the DDB are needed.Following the above observations, this project develops a methodology, architecture, and algorithms for a Dynamic Data Fusion / Dynamic Decision Support Systems (DDF/DDSS). A stand-alone DDF/DDSS system will be developed and experimentally tested usingapplication domain data. The proposed DDF/DDSS approach performs data flow analysis on-line with the decision making process and interacts with a human via an advanced 3-D visual interface. It identifies bottlenecks and problems in the information flow,and based on this analysis, it generates queries/requests for information update to the DDB and information sources. The DDF/DDSS requests selective data items rather than shifting large parts of the DDB to the system input.

We demonstrated that this protocol combined with selected CPM signaling could further increase performance for transmission over DASA or dedicated UHF SATCOM channels.    In Phase II, we will implement and demonstrate the protocol using COTS DAMA/DASA radios and selected marine antennas operating over a UHF SATCOM link to validate these performance improvements and to refine the protocol parameters for optimal performance.Variable channel fading conditions will be reproduced using a radio channel simulator. Phase II option tasks include following the initial demonstration by an end-to-end demonstration with equipment installed in a UUV testbed.  We will develop a system forcollecting and distributing UUV intelligence data throughout the NMCI in compliance with Net-Centric Warfare to expedite transition to Phase III, as well as developing approaches to support increasing bandwidth requirements in support of UUV missionplanning in order to ensure scalability.  Plans for Phase III implementation of the protocol as a JTRS module will be developed. Specific military interest for the use of this protocol has been identified. The proposed data-link-control protocol will greatly improve network performance in both existing and emerging satellite networks that may be subject to fading.  It can beapplied to a wide range of satellite communications, such as submarine communications, corporate satellite networks, remote satellite telemetry, network control data, intelligence data, image transmission, and digital video, as well as to corporate branchoffices, and utility data networks.

The major goal of the  research is establishing reproducible procedures for the manufacture of the new magnetic particles. This is   the key activity required in order to commercialize the new particles. Scale-up to commercial scale   manufacturing and validation of the process will be performed. Two additional important, though less critical,   ]ctivities will be developing improving the thermal stability of the hydrophilic coating and provision of alternate functionality on the coating.",

Thethroughput and quality will be improved because the new process does not rely on moving the parts through a baffled hot/cold zone to control the temperature gradient in the part during solidification.  We anticipate that this technique will also allowcomplex geometrics to be successfully cast in DS or SX orientation, which can significantly extend the life of the cast parts, compared to equiaxed castings.",

        "abstract": "SMI has discovered a new ferroelectric material, CexMnyO3 (CMO), that, for the first time, will allow nonvolatile ferroelectric memories to be formed directly on silicon - greatly simplifying the cell geometry and thus increasing density and performance -all while eliminating manufacturing steps and thus reducing costs. Heretofore, all ferroelectric memories have required a silicon / ferroelectric interlayer barrier electrode to be used. The material was demonstrated using SMI's SpinCVDTM Metal OrganicChemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) techniques. The ferroelectric layer is crystallized into a perovskite at a suitable temperature for direct integrated circuit front-end process insertion and has produced a nonvolatile memory without use of metalelectrodes.  The most compelling aspects are that the ferroelectric phase can be grown directly on silicon and that the dielectric constant of the ferroelectric film is relatively low (more than an order of magnitude lower that PZT, ranging between 20 and100 depending upon polarization state) and 25 times higher than silicon oxide. The low perovskite crystallization temperature and compatibility of the films with silicon make CMOs ideal for a ferroelectric field effect transistors (FEFET) simulating a DRAMcell. We propose to build upon the Phase I effort by manufacturing an EEPROM 1-transistor (FeFET) memory that is scaleable for very high-density memories.   This FEFET design will allow a FE memory to rival stacked-gate Flash cells in density, but withoutthe drawbacks of floating gate technology. We will work with a proven Rad-Hard device production company and other experts in the field to ensure a commercializable process and product. We will combine the SMI ferroelectric with our partner's deviceradiation designs for product manufacture.  Phase III will be a manufacturing partnership producing drop-in Radiation Hard nonvolatile memory devices.",

        "abstract": "In the phase I SBIR program Structured Materials Industries, Inc. (SMI) successfully demonstrated that an antimonide-based HBT, with speeds in excess of 100 GHz and near zero turn-on voltage should be achievable. This was done by growing an AlInAsSb layerlattice matched to GaSb with an Al content less than 50%--overcoming the miscibility gap. To our knowledge, such growth has not been previously reported. The enabled device structure has the advantages of near zero-turn-on-voltage (low power) and highmobilities (high speed). Thus, high-speed low power devices, which are needed for high-speed communication, will now be possible. The issues resolved in the Phase I effort were lattice matching, alloy tuning, doping, device design, and measurement ofmaterial properties, among others. In Phase II, we propose to build upon the results from Phase I and (1) produce fully functioning HBT devices; (2) demonstrate zero-turn-on-voltage device operation; (3) fully characterize the devices; (4) package thedevices (for Phase III commercialization); (5) optimize the device design to achieve > 100 GHz operation; (6) sample devices to collaborators, and (7) define the routine device production routes for Phase III commercialization. Phase III commercializationwill go forward in an SMI-Sarnoff joint venture for military and commercial applications.",

The IUSS is a force-on-force model used by analysts to support acquisition and materiel designconsiderations affecting individual combatants and small units in high-resolution combat and OOTW.  To improve the fidelity of simulation and better support the decision-making needs of analysts, improved behavioral representations are required.In tune with current trends in human behavior representation and consistent with the needs of the analysis community, emphasis is placed on the use of human performance data to model the capabilities and behaviors of the human dynamic as it relates toweapon firing.  To automate aspects of weapons firing such as realistic behavior generation, we propose to extend the knowledge acquisition methodologies developed in Henninger (2002) to study additional aspects of weapons firing.  This would include aformal specification of inputs, outputs, relationships, and metrics.  Tangible results of this effort would minimally include a knowledge specification for IC behavior development that identifies influencing factors in weapons firing, behavior resultingfrom those influences (including sub-optimal and erroneous behaviors), and Phit/Pkill estimates based on these factors.Creating realistic, real-time virtual humans is an ambitious goal being pursued by a variety of communities, including the military simulation and training organizations, computer science and psychology researchers, and the entertainment/computer gameindustry.  The results of this work should be of interest to military simulation developers (e.g., assessing the impact of new infantry weapons against realistic adversaries), the research community (e.g., understanding information processing requirementsand parsimonious representations for real-time spatial reasoning), and homeland defense and law enforcement agencies (for training applications).",

        "abstract": "The FCS vision of future armored and mechanized military structure includes use of mixed teams of human and robotic forces on a dynamic, rapidly changing battlefield. This will require an overall force reduction with multiple entities controlled byindividual team leaders and multiple teams to be lead by higher-echelon commanders. To accomplish this, systems will have to be designed to require less human interaction and greater robotic autonomy. Successful implementation of this shift will requireautonomous and semi-autonomous robotic forces and a command and control infrastructure that will allow both human and robotic-teams to be controlled quickly and easily. Key to this will be the degree to which teams and individual robots are autonomous, andwhether the commander's human-machine interface is designed so the commander has superior control & awareness of the situation.  The initial phase of this effort will determine whether an agent framework built around the three specified agent types(Tasking, Coordinating, Monitoring) can be constructed to add an intelligent abstraction layer between human military commanders and robotic battlefield entities.  The focus will be to identify the human-interface issues, design potential solutions andcreate software that supports the commander's tasks and mitigates human performance limitations.The technical and theoretical accomplishments produced by this project will be crucial for successfully implementing the FCS force transformation vision becauseit will provide the multiplier effects necessary for optimal control of robotic teams.  Other FCS command and control programs will thus be the primary commercial opportunity.  In addition, the interface agent system developed for this project hasapplications in other domains with similar command and control requirements.  Crisis management, for situations such as natural disasters, riot control, event or personal security, and terrorist attacks, where tight coordination of multiple cooperatingteams is crucial, is a key domain in which Cooperative Interface Agents for Networked Command, Control and Communication (CIANC3) technology can provide enhanced performance.

        "abstract": "In response to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD)'s need for adaptable information assimilation systems to support the fast paced flow and complexity of the evolving battlefield in both Command and Control (C2) and direct combat applications,Soar Technology, Inc. proposes to research and design an intelligent information configuration system. This system will support dynamic configuration of warfighters information displays based on the warfighter current state and working environment.Innovative features of this system include; the development of a high-level language to encode flexible information delivery heuristics that incorporate current human-factors and domain expertise, a user modeling system that leverages dynamic measures ofcognitive readiness to drive the configuration process, and an intelligent user interface design based on intelligent agents that will directly place the heuristics in the information-processing pipeline. This solution will not only have wide militaryapplication, at multiple levels of Command and Control and battlefield systems, but also in application areas as diverse as industrial and manufacturing control, law enforcement, emergency response management, air traffic control, and medical informationsystems.  The BINAH system will support the military in reducing the complexity of complex, networked systems at the same time it improves the systems capability for delegating routine, mundane, and time-consuming warfighter tasks. The core of this benefitis the BINAH systems ability to help shift information fusion responsibilities from monolith central systems to the edge of the network where information can be rapidly configured to match the needs of individual warfighters, enabling the right informationto be delivered to the warfighter in the right form to match their current needs. Specific capabilities and benefits of the system include:1. The BINAH system will provide a novel mechanism for incorporating dynamic measures of cognitive readiness into the information display pipeline, allowing the display system to change display strategies as the warfighters needs change.2. The BINAH system will provide the capability for designers of warfighter information display systems to incorporate the best knowledge of their field into the systems in a manner that is flexible, validatable, powerful and expressive enabling thedisplay system to maximize the warfighters assimilation of information and sense-making even under adverse conditions.3. The BINAH system will provide an advanced agent-based reasoning capability allowing the system to draw key inferences from the incoming data stream enabling the information pipeline to transform the data into knowledge about the warfighters work contextand support the warfighters understanding of that context.4. The BINAH project will provide a core architecture that is specifically tailored for the Air Tasking domain, but designed to be general and ready to be incorporated into wide variety of military and commercial systems.In addition to the wide range of military C2, ISR systems and Land Warrior display systems that BINAH could support, there a number of key commercial prospects for the BINAH system:1. The BINAH system is well suited to support large-scale intelligence operations including the national intelligence community, homeland security, federal emergency management, Customs operations such as tracking fraud, counterfeiting, or childpornography, and others. In these cases, there is a mix of short-duration, high-tempo intelligence fusion, and long-duration low-tempo monitoring for specific warnings or indicators.2. The BINAH system is well suited to serve smaller civilian operations that include a high degree of command and control and/or intelligence such as 911 call centers and other crime prevention operations, drug interdiction, organized crime task forces,and border patrols.3.The BINAH system is well suited to serve large-scale commercial intelligence operations such as financial forecasting and other forms of business intelligence, industrial process control and automation control, and other business domains where largescale environmental monitoring is required such as oil refinery and mine operations.",

In the option period we will add an interface to the Geographical Information System used by J25 and a module for single facility fault tree analysis. The net result of this research will be a decision support toolthat will aid in vulnerability assessments and response planning in large infrastructure networks.  The Decision Support Tool emerging from this research will be of value not only to the U.S. Navy but also to many Federal, State, and Local Governmentauthorities responsible for planning and responding to terrorist attacks and disasters and maintaining infrastructure services to the community.  The tool may also be useful to the risk management departments of corporations, large utilities and insurancecompanies as well. Other operationally critical organizations such as hospitals and airports could also use the tool to identify and mitigate threats to their continuous operation.",

        "abstract": "Mandates to use native wildflower and grass seed began in 1987 with the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act and have been reinforced by two Executive Orders.  Current demand for native seed exceeds the supply, therefore the need exists to develop additional native seed sources.  Land uses such as conservation, recreation, and wildlife habitat offer the potential for native seed production.  Restrictions to establishing native grasses and wildflower areas include scarcity and cost of native seeds, lack of technical knowledge, access to specialized equipment and marketing opportunities.  This Phase II project will work in three different regions of the US (Georgia, Texas and Virginia) to establish native grass and wildflower plots on private and public lands.  We will demonstrate a business concept that includes technical assistance, access to specialized equipment, and assistance with marketing and distributing the produced native seed.  The principals will work with contacts made during the Phase I to locate remnant native areas and collect locally adapted ecotypes of native plants.  Some of this local seed will be planted in demonstration plots, which will be used in conjunction with the remnant areas for public field days to demonstrate the planting and harvesting techniques.  The results of the studies will be used to refine the business concept for producing and marketing native seeds.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed research is to develop an optimized microcarrier-bioreactor cell culture system that enables the rapid, efficient, large scale, low cost production of human influenza vaccine. Most human influenza virus vaccine is produced in embryonated eggs. The Federal government and other worldwide organizations are seeking alternative cell-culture approaches to influenza vaccine production since there are inherent difficulties with the egg-derived vaccines. Under normal conditions there are long lead times between (a) the identification of particular virus strains likely in each flu season and (b) the availability of appropriate vaccines against these virus strains. Microcarrier-bioreactor cell-culture technology has the potential to lower production costs and reduce the time required to produce 93 million doses of monovalent vaccine to a few months. This potential to rapidly achieve large scale, would be invaluable in case of an influenza pandemic and possibly could counter a pandemic or bioterrorist acts.  To achieve the research goals, five specific aims will optimize microcarrier-bioreactor culture process parameters that affect viral yield with Vero and MDCK cells and develop protocols applicable to economic commercial use. We will (i) license manufacturing protocols to large producers of flu vaccine and (ii) sell Hillex microcarriers for those protocols.    \n  \nSpecific Aim I. To identify and integrate critical cell culture and viral growth parameters for optimal production of human influenza virus in Vero cells grown in Hillex microcarrier-suspension culture.    \nSpecific Aim II. To extend the range of viral growth parameters (as identified in Specific Aim I) to include six additional strains of influenza virus and to compare the virus production in direct \"head-to-head\" competition between embryonated eggs and Vero cells grown in Hillex microcarrier-suspension culture.    \nSpecific Aim III. To assess production of human influenza virus in Vero cells grown in a microcarrier-bioreactor culture at the one liter scale.    \nSpecific Aim IV: To develop a process to expand and scale-up Vero cells from a working seed ampoule to a five liter culture and to demonstrate that the passaged cells will support high influenza virus concentrations at a larger scale.    \nSpecific Aim V: To identify and integrate critical cell culture parameters for optimal production of human influenza virus (A/Wuhan/395/95) in MDCK cells grown in Hillex microcarrier-bioreactor culture.",

        "abstract": "An inexpensive method to insulate the CIGS thin-film from the stainless steel substrate is needed to make monolithic production of lightweight CIGS-based photovoltaics feasible. This coating must allow good foil flexibility and exhibit high breakdownvoltages.  The coating must also be compatible with the CIGS and metal substrate layers, both thermophysically and chemically.  An inexpensive method of reliably depositing this thin coating over large areas of foil without pinholes is also desirable.To meet these requirements, Sommer Materials Research (SMR) has developed an ambient-air approach to deposit a layer of soda-lime glass on the surface of stainless steel foil sufficiently thin to allow the metal foil to be flexed to a small radius.Pinhole-free coatings with breakdown voltages as high as 350V were demonstrated on glass coatings less than 2 mils thick.  In Phase II, a roll-to-roll deposition process will be developed to coat foil up to 5",

A training infrastructure was defined that will accommodate individual and team trainingrequirements within a closed-loop adaptive training system employing a seamless combination of adaptive interactive multimedia instruction (IMI)- and simulation-based intelligent tutoring.  This technology will support knowledge acquisition using adaptiveIMI and supervised skills practice using simulation-based intelligent tutoring, all within a common architecture employing a unified learner model.The Phase I effort culminated in the delivery of a final report that addressed three main topics:closed-loop adaptive training concept of operation, closed-loop adaptive training architecture, and a description of the proposed Phase II prototype.  The Phase II objective is to develop the prototype training system, targeting the ASW/ASUW Tactical AirController (ASTAC) curriculum as the domain of interest. The research conducted under this SBIR will contribute directly to the development of a fully functional closed-loop adaptive training system that will support individual and team training within atotal-ship training environment.

Our new model will provide accurate specifications and forecasts for convection electric fields, particle precipitation, conductances, Jouleheating rates, field-aligned and ionospheric currents, and ionospheric densities in the D, E, and F regions.  High-resolution patterns of the electrodynamic parameters will be calculated continuously as a function of time, and a unique feature of the modelwill be its ability to capture sharp electrodynamic boundaries and mesoscale structures.  The physics-based model will be a time-dependent, high-resolution, coupled model containing a high-latitude ionospheric model and an electrodynamic model ofmagnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. The data to be assimilated will include ground-based magnetometer and radar data, in situ satellite measurements, data from imaging satellites, and GPS-TEC measurements.  The data will be assimilated via a Kalman filtertechnique, which has been successfully used in meteorology and oceanography. Quality control algorithms will also be developed so that the different data types can be cleaned and reduced before assimilation.  The model will be tested for robustness andvalidated for quiet and storm conditions. Finally, the electrodynamic model will be installed on AFRL computers and a user's manual will be provided.",

Composite materials will replace metals to manufacture some FSC vehicle structures.  Because composite materials affect the propagation and scatteringof electromagnetic energy differently than metals, there is a growing need to rapidly analyze electromagnetic interactions between composite vehicle structures and vehicular mounted antennas.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is a somatic genetic disease that strikes over one million Americans per year. The majority of tumors arise due to somatic mutations in a small set of known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Somatic mutations can occur anywhere in the gene, but the specific location and identity of the mutations greatly influences tumor aggressiveness and response to treatment. However, these mutations are difficult to characterize using existing technologies because DNA extracted directly from the tumor comes from a mixture of cancerous and non-cancerous tissue. The goal of this project is to develop Peptide Mass Signature Genotyping (PMSG) into a low-cost and reliable method for identifying and characterizing oncogene and tumor suppressor mutations in heterogeneous DNA samples taken directly from tumors. The initial test will analyze the TP53 gene, the most commonly mutated gene in human cancers. PMSG employs protein expression systems to generate recombinant, tagged peptides from more than one reading frame of the DNA under test after which the peptides are purified and analyzed using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and interpretive software. The large bandwidth of the MALDI mass spectrum permits multiplexed analysis of numbers of peptides simultaneously, each of which represents several hundred bases of DNA sequence. However, the analysis is limited to a significant degree by the presence of stop codons in some reading frames of the target sequence and so, protein expression capability needs to be expanded by utilizing suppressor tRNA mutations in the bacterial expression system in combination with serial affinity capture. This will result in a test that covers all of the coding exons of the gene and their associated splice sites. The most labor intensive steps in the process will be automated to achieve a standardized, higher throughput, lower cost analytical test. Cancer-related genes will be the initial focus, but the automated platform will find commercial application in a number of additional fields where it is useful or necessary to scan mixed populations of DNA for mutations. These include infectious disease, inherited disease, and pharmacogenetics.",

Realizing this objective will open the market for thrombolysis in acute stroke, a market which presently remains impeded because of hemorrhage risk. The proposed work will explore 2MHz, 1MHz and 0.2MHz therapeutic ultrasound using a proprietary method to concurrently deliver diagnostic and therapeutic ultrasound through the same probe footprint. \n\nThe diagnostic ultrasound will aid in aiming the therapeutic beam and then assess blood flow (i.e., recanalization) along the beam axis. The therapeutic ultrasound will enhance thrombolytic activity along the same beam axis. Instrumentation to perform blood flow/recanalization monitoring simultaneously with thrombolytic enhancement will be developed and optimized. Safety tests will be performed to determine which ultrasound protocols are free from adverse bioeffects in an appropriate animal model. \n\nThis Phase II project is the extension of successfully completed Phase I aims. Phase I was comprised of three principle components: (1) the development of a new animal model of thromboembolic occlusion that greatly facilitates the study of promising therapeutic protocols, (2) the prototyping of an ultrasound device and probe for concurrent diagnostic and therapeutic insonation of vasculature containg thrombus, and (3) the testing of therapeutic efficacy in a series of protocols evaluating 2MHz and 0.2MHz ultrasound. Testing results of the last component demonstrated dramatically the efficacy of 0.2MHz ultrasound in enhancement of thrombolysis, while results for 2MHz had insufficient statistical power to make conclusions. The Phase I results confirm ultrasound enhanced thrombolysis as a major clinical advance towards the treatment of stroke. Ultrasound promises to shorten the recanalization time for stroke victims and to reduce the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage by enabling a lower dose of thrombolytie drug. Phase II will make use of the animal model of Phase I, and targets revisions to the therapeutic device of Phase I, a thorough evaluation of instrument efficacy, instrument safety, and ability to reduce thrombolytic drug dose.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Nanocrystalline homometallic (same as the substrate and without interface) coatings will be developed to reduce wear of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) in orthopedic prostheses. UHMWPE wear is a primary cause of prosthesis failure, and roughness of the mating Co-Cr surface has been identified as a major contributing factor to UHMWPE wear. Third-body wear particles, such as bone cement constituents, scratch the articulating surface, roughening it and accelerating UHMWPE wear. Attempts to apply conventional hard ceramic coatings to the metallic surfaces have not been successful because of difficulties in achieving adequate adhesion due to dissimilarity of coating and substrate materials and thermal and lattice mismatches.   \n  \nWe have demonstrated, for the first time, that nanocrystalline (3-40 nm grains) Co-Or deposited onto Co-Cr-Mo substrates possesses hardness close to that of some ceramics (18-26 GPa, 400% increase), without the associated problems with adhesion to metallic substrates. (Similar results have also been obtained for Ti and stainless steel). In post Phase I work, we have demonstrated uniform deposition of superhard homometallic coatings onto Co-Cr femoral hip heads. Ongoing hip simulation tests have demonstrated up to 75% reduction in UHWMPE wear against homometallic Co-Or femoral heads vs. uncoated Co-Cr. Additionally, atomic force microscopy shows that the homometallic coatings retain the same low surface roughness as the original, highly polished Co-Cr. These results clearly demonstrate feasibility of the proposed technology.   \n  \nPhase 2 will optimize the processes involved in deposition of homometallic coatings and evaluate them in Hip Simulation tests, which will be done by Stephen Li at the Medical Device Testing and Innovation and a major Orthopedic Company.",

Experiments by SRS and others have shown that certain isomers can be triggered to release their stored energy at an accelerated rate byirradiating the isomers with low-energy x-rays. The energy gain is nearly 200 times in some isomers, and the released energy is in the form of gamma rays capable of triggering additional releases. The possibility exists to use a portion of the releasedenergy to drive a self-sustaining chain reaction. A controlled accelerated release of stored energy could be harnessed for a High Energy Density Storage System (HEDSS) for future Army systems. Phase II will develop isomer triggering technology bycharacterizing the triggering properties for three isomers. This technology will lead to a",

These materials can be produced with excellent optical quality surface characteristics, ideal forfront surface mirrors, and cast into aspherical shapes for imaging applications. These precision cast membrane mirrors have the potential for reducing the aerial density, packaging volume, and cost of space-based optics by an order of magnitude. Theoptical surface quality of these mirrors is excellent, however, a method is needed to establish and maintain the global figure of these mirrors once deployed. The feasibility of  using the intrinsic stress of energetically deposited optical coatings tocontrol the global figure of the membrane mirrors has been demonstrated in previous research on small scale  mirrors. This program will demonstrate that method can be applied to manufacture net shape membrane mirrors of large apertures. Recently developedlarge scale casting and coating facilities will be used to demonstrate the technology for a 1.5 meter net shape membrane mirror. At this scale, membrane mirror technology begins to be beneficial to a large class of applications. Additionally this work willshow scalability of the process to much larger sizes.",

More efficient deployable antennas can be used, but they are large and require a large, clear site for setup and asignificant amount of deployment time. Neither of these solutions meets the Army''s On-The-Move/zero setup time requirements for maintaining continuous communications with airborne Cavalry units. STAR-H Corporation has successfully demonstrated in itsPhase I efforts a new, effective, rugged, simple to construct low-profile loop antenna concept that can be deployed on almost any kind of vehicle or as a stand-alone antenna. This antenna can be rapidly switched from NVIS mode to low angle mode forsupporting both close-in nap of the earth operations and longer range beyond line of sight (BLOS) HF communications. In its Phase II effort, STAR-H Corporation proposes to adapt its low-profile loop antenna to two Army platforms, the HMMWV and the TOCShelter mounted on a HMMWV. At the end of Phase II, two rugged prototype antennas, one for each platform, will be tested and delivered to the Army.The new antenna will provide NVIS HF communication between vehicles, aircraft, and ground facilities inmountainous terrain. It will also be capable of being switched to low angle propagation, which will provide enhanced long distance communication. Non-military applications will include communication among forest firefighters in mountainous terrain, plususe in emergency vehicles, oil and gas exploration, disaster relief, and communications in developing countries in similarly difficult terrain. This antenna has both a more effective NVIS radiation characteristic than alternative vehicle mounted antennasand a lower profile, reducing visibility and the risk of contact with overhead obstacles such as power lines. The market for this antenna is worldwide.",

        "abstract": "Existing radio communications systems rely on the formal maintenance of a separation of their signals in the frequency domain (RF spectrum).  Currently these systems rely on administrative measures to assign frequencies to users based on maintain therequired separation in frequency and in distance.  Because the results of potential interference are likely to result in a significant disruption of communications for affected users, the administrators of the frequency allocation systems tend tooverprotect users by conservatively allocating users to frequencies.  This results in wasted RF spectrum, especially in cases where the users are itinerant.  Even in dense RF environments, much of the spectrum is unused most of the time.  This system willallow users to share spectrum in time and frequency.  The system will listen for quiet portions of the spectrum and assign a user to that frequency which has the least probability of being used during the course of a transmission.  This spectrum sharingsystem will mine the ambient RF spectrum for unused bandwidth and dynamically assign it for communications.  This is a revolutionary development in the use of the limited natural resource, which is only possible through the use of advanced computing anddigital signal processing technology.Currently Army units must carefully coordinate RF frequencies to minute detail when an operation is planned for an area.  This coordination must include not only Army and US Military users, but all other users, militaryand civilian, enemy and allied within an area.  Not all of these entities are cooperative, so much work must be done on the basis of assumptions and conservative planning.  Even with this attention to detail, units may still run into interference problemsonce they are deployed, and this can reduce the operational effectiveness of their communications.  This proposed system will allow units to deploy into the field with minimal prior frequency coordination and automatically identify and select unusedfrequencies for use by their communications systems.  Ultimately this technology is expected to transition to the civilian sector to improve the management and utilization of the RF spectrum for commercial users, which is currently a tremendous economicand technical problem not only in the United States, but also worldwide.  The potential applications of this technology are enormous and the effect on society and our military and economic security will be substantial.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovative Research project uses analogical reasoning in machines to support analogical reasoning in humans. It was motivated by recent discoveries in psychology by Gentner and her colleagues indicating that, without explicit guidance,humans do a poor job of discerning useful analogies across cases, and that they often fail to retrieve useful analogous cases from memory when needed.  The empirical evidence indicates that students do a better job of analogical encoding and futureknowledge transfer, if encouraged to construct analogies at learning time. In Phase-II, we propose to implement and evaluate the authoring tool and one example application Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) as designed and prototyped during Phase-I.  Ourdesign uses analogical reasoning technology to improve on conventional case-method instruction by assisting the author (military domain expert or instructor) in locating multiple analogous cases at lesson creation time.  It then helps the author use thosecases in lessons that foster analogical encoding by students at runtime. We have obtained course material from National Defense University and Phase-II participation of military experts and educators to guide the design of the authoring tool and creationof an initial library of example military cases and lessons.   The loose coupling of these two systems through a small set of MAC/FAC invocation calls by the RASCAL authoring and runtime systems, will lay the foundation for important future work in severalrelated areas: human dialog with agents that perform analogical reasoning, dialog agents that perform analogical reasoning as part of interpretation and generation of context-appropriate dialog contributions, advanced search engines that reason across acorpus of documents and across sequential queries indicating user needs, to name only a few.",

Job failure is a major impediment to achieving acceptable levels of throughput for cluster and grid computing tasks.  This project will develop an infrastructure that uses a collection of distributed reasoning agents to monitor running applications and to recover from execution failures. A collection of agents, distributed throughout the system, will monitor the progress of batch jobs and determine if and how to restart those jobs when they fail.  Phase I demonstrated the viability of the agent system as a way for specifying and executing fault management policies.  In cooperation with prospective users at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), a set of use cases was developed for failure detection and recovery, and these use cases were implemented on a prototype small cluster.  A strategy was developed for scaling these results to larger cluster and Grid environments.  The end result of the Phase II effort will be a system that enhances the reliability of jobs running in Grid computing environments.  Phase II will extend the prototype system so that it runs reliably on the NERSC Science Data Management Group (SDMG) cluster and the STAR production cluster.  This system will be used to build an architecture that can be used in Grid computing environments.    Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The first and most straightforward application would be job monitoring and recovery for high-throughput jobs submitted to clusters and Grids.

        "abstract": "Training military medical personnel to maintain readiness for medical emergencies and combat-related operations is a critical problem. Distance learning solutions are required for providing effective training while minimizing the time away from theimportant peacetime duty of providing quality medical care to military personnel. Since medical emergencies are unexpected, it is important to dynamically generate customized courses to address the particular emergency. It is also important to address theprecise learning needs of the medical team being trained.This proposal describes ADAPT-MD, a simulation-based Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) for delivering personalized training to medical teams. Much like human instructors, ITSs dynamically assess and diagnose students' knowledge and skill levels andprovide training that is customized to the students' learning needs. Using innovative simulation and assessment techniques, ADAPT-MD provides adaptive, targeted instruction to individuals and teams. It is based on the SCORM standard. It includes anauthoring tool for specifying content modules, domain knowledge, and instructional techniques. Phase I laid the foundations for Phase II in terms of defining user requirements, application design and a prototype to demonstrate feasibility. Phase II willdevelop a fully-functional framework and apply it to the domain of training for providers of hyperbaric treatment.  The ITS framework developed at the end Phase II can be applied to other medical training domains. The need for quality medical training technology is quite substantial, within and outside the military. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports,there are about 6 million healthcare practitioners and technicians in the country. There are about 6000 hospitals and 33,000 nursing and personal care facilities in the United States alone. The proposed Phase II effort will help us establish the usefulnessof simulator-based ITS for medical training and so facilitate our marketing efforts with non-government medical groups. We also have close contacts with developers' high-fidelity simulators for medical training. We will explore avenues of collaboratingwith them to commercialize the Adapt-MD framework.",

The aid will provide products including intelligencecollection requirements, profiles of adversaries relevant to PSYOPS, and simulation capabilities at various levels of abstraction, from determining adversaries' strategic goals to wargaming actual battlefield scenarios. The system will consist of a generalmodel for the effects of culture on decision making and behavior, authoring and automated analysis techniques for applying this model to specific tactical situations, and a mechanism for execution of behavior in existing military simulations. Theknowledge-based nature of the system will allow tracking of uncertainties and assumptions, authorship by nonexperts, and meaningful explanations of outcomes. Our cultural model will be based on the Cultural Lens model of cultural differences in militarydomains, as well as a case-based reasoning engine that uses past examples of scenarios and groups with specific cultural traits. We will use existing software components and authoring tools, allowing us to focus our effort on the representations andartificial intelligence algorithms necessary to define and apply cultural aspects of behavior and decision-making to simulation.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   \nRecent advances in tissue engineering hold great promise for alleviating the current shortage of tissues and organs available for transplantation. However, engineered skin tissue produced with primary human keratinocytes is slow to vascularize following engraftment, resulting in tissue ischemia and a low frequency of graft take. These limitations may be overcome by genetically modifying the tissue such that it produces factors that are known to promote vascularization and angiogenesis. The ultimate goal of these studies is to develop cultured skin tissue that exhibits accelerated vascularization and improved wound healing following engraftment. During Phase I, it was demonstrated that human NIKS TM keratinocytes can be stably modified to express elevated levels of angiogenic factors from non-viral vectors. This Phase II SBIR proposal is designed to expand upon progress made during Phase I by determining whether cultured skin tissue that expresses elevated levels of angiogenic growth factors will exhibit accelerated vascularization in an animal model of wound healing. The expression profiles and growth characteristics of multiple independent stably-transfected keratinocyte clones will be characterized to identify clones that express different levels of the angiogenic factors. Skin tissue prepared from these NIKS TM cells will be grafted onto mice and monitored over time to quantify the effect of angiogenic factor expression on wound healing and vascularization. Successful completion of these studies will position this technology for further pre-clinical assessment and ultimate evaluation in human clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: Currently growers are using toxic and at times injurious chemicals on millions of acres of agricultural crop that require multiple fungicide treatments to control disease. Many if not most of the existing products have high chronic toxicity, are suspected human carcinogens and/or teratogens and often times are toxic to birds, fish and beneficial insects. It is likely that some of the products will not be re-registered under the Food Quality Protection Act, thereby creating a demand for safer products to meet grower needs. Use of more environmentally friendly products by the growers would also lower consumer risk. The discovery of alternative chemicals that protect food safety would agree with some of the goals for sustainable agriculture and protect quality of life. This SBIR Phase II project will accelerate the development of novel, safe fungicides as treatments for disease control in potato and peanut. Summerdale, Inc. has shown that specific, synergistic combinations of organic acids have fungicidal properties against a wide range of pathogens. Phase I demonstrated that rates for effective use of the food-grade components as fungicides appear economically attractive and competitive with existing fungicides.",

Small molecule caspase-1 inhibitors represent a new class of arthritis therapeutics with the advantages of oral availability and decreased toxicity.  Covalent tethering, a technology developed at Sunesis Pharmaceuticals involves a \"screen-then-link\" process that allows a greater survey of chemical diversity space than is achievable using the large compound libraries typically screened by pharmaceutical firms. A variation of this approach, known as extended tethering identified a high potency cell-active caspase-1 inhibitor during Phase I. Extended tethering is particularly powerful for enzyme targets such as caspase-l that contain an active site cysteine residue and for which active site binding determinants are well characterized. Moreover, extended tethering provides not only an efficient means of ligand discovery but also a direct path to lead optimization since the target protein is used as a template for the construction of its: own inhibitor. Our Phase II proposal capitalizes on the promising caspase-1 inhibitor identified by extended tethering in Phase I and proposes to carry it forward through lead optimization and to pre-clinical development.",

These prototypes will be one hour units and will have the same volume as half hour units of 4500 psicompressed breathing air.  The supercritical breathing gas is single phase so that it will feed identically in any attitude, unlike liquid air.  This is particularly important for underwater work as the attitudes are extremely variable.  Because of themoderate or higher pressure the system will supply gas at any useable depth of dive.  When out of the water the apparatus may be used for full respiratory protection against airborne chemical or biological agents.  In addition, due to the cryogenic storageof the air there is considerable cooling capacity to reduce heat stress in the user during hot climate deployments or when wearing impermeable garments.  For normal underwater operations the heat to warm the breathing gas will come from the surroundingwater, whereas for hot environment and land operations the heat will be supplied by the users body.  The metabolic energy and heat transfer from the surrounding water is transferred to the breathing gas before it is consumed.Added features which could be investigated in the Phase II option would be to harden the system to military standards for electronics and periphial items. Another feature would be to develop improved human-machine interfaces. The supercritical cryogenic(SCC) SCUBA will have many commercial applications in professional diving and recreational industries.  The greatly increased bottom time will be economically useful in photographic, salvage, and archeological work.  The coolingcapability will allow diving in hot springs where time is now extremely restricted.  With the addition of the option to provide a heating system in addition to the cooling the complete envelope of diving capability would be expanded into both thermalextremes.",

This project will combine the best features of the internal tin and modified jelly roll processes to reduce these losses and costs.  In Phase I, multiple-barrier restacks were made from single-barrier material and Mono Element Internal Tin (MEIT) processed material, with and without internal fins.  Each configuration was tested, and comparisons were made among them.  In the material without fins, Jc was maintained, and the losses were significantly reduced\u00c2\u00bfbut not to less than 40\u00c2\u00bfm as desired.  The problem was that in the material containing Ti in the Sn core, strand breakage was experienced when the subelements were small, and the subelement material could not be reduced below 0.8mm.  Material without Ti in the core was processed without breakage down to 0.17mm, even though it had Cu in the Sn.  Based on these results, Phase II will process multiple-barrier subelement billets, both with and without fins, using NbTa 7.5wt% filaments with no Ti in the cores, and with thicker barriers and larger filaments than used in Phase I.  A series of restacks, including \u00c2\u00bfdouble stacked\u00c2\u00bf arrays will be made and tested to determine the best combination of billet design and restack procedure.  Once this has been determined with small billets, three larger billets will be made and processed to yield material that will be supplied to DOE for testing in magnets.

Both of these characteristics should be known for full coating characterization.

Results from Phase I indicate that ion-implanted resists may be stripped away in 5 min at 125 C, without any film popping and particle contamination as is normally observed during dry processing. The Phase II project will thoroughly research and optimize the process chemistry. In addition, a prototype cleaning system will be developed that meets all the technical criteria established by the semiconductor industry for organic cleaning operations. \n\nThis SBIR Phase II project has broad commercial and societal impact. Semiconductor equipment devoted to organic residue cleaning represents a mult-ibillion dollar market. If our environmentally benign, high-pressure plasma cleaning tool can achieve all the technical objectives outlined in the proposal than it stands a good chance of garnering a significant share of this market.  Moreover, it will replace current water-wasteful and hazardous wet cleans with an innovative process that uses non-toxic reagents and generates minimal waste. This will substantially benefit our society by mitigating the environmental, health and safety impacts of semiconductor manufacturing.",

        "abstract": "SY Technology, Inc. proposes to develop an imaging system to aid the warfighter and civilian firefighters to see through battlefield obscurants and smoke.   The polarimetric imager will consist of a polarized source and a polarization detection imagingsystem. The system will be constructed using visible imagers and a monolithic, division-of-aperture optic to produce a cheap, rugged system suitable for use on the battlefield.  Further reductions in size will enable the imager to be the size of acamcorder or even smaller.  The Phase I effort consisted of a measurements program on two aerosols at two different wavelengths.  This data indicated that significant improvements in contrast are possible using the appropriate combination of illuminatingand detected polarization states and wavelength. The Phase II work will complete the design developed under the Phase I Option; calibrate, test, and demonstrate the instrumentation; test phenomenology; and explore commercial applications for the techniquesdeveloped in this work.The instrumentation development and demonstration will take advantage of SY Technology's capability and expertise in polarization measurements and instrument design.  This effort will also capitalize on recent experiments in this area using instrumentationavailable to SY Technology, Inc. and other government partners through research and development agreements.It is anticipated that the imaging polarimeter will significantly enhance a soldier's ability to see through conventional obscurants on thebattlefield, particularly in urban warfare scenarios.  Potential commercial applications include aiding a firefighter's ability to see in smoke filled areas, imaging through fog for aircraft and automobiles, remote sensing, and medical imaging.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR  Phase II project aims to  develop a prototype of a highly-parallel, mass-selected purification system for large pharmaceutical drug libraries. High-throughput purification is driven by the industry recognition that combinatorial chemistry samples must still be purified even after chemical screening. This project will examine monolithic parallel preparative liquid chromatography configurations. The key enabling technology is low-pressure photoionization mass spectrometry (LPPI MS), which permits accurate molecular detection in mixtures of compounds without the problems of competition-for-charge and ion suppressions that plague conventional ionization methods. A practical purification rate of >1 sample/min (12 parallel purifications in 960 sample purifications/day is expected. This work will transition into a Phase II prototype involving strategic partners to commercialize the technology. \n\nThe proposed high throughput purification system for combinatorial libraries has the potential to dominate an important niche market for molecular analysis and screening for drug discovery. This rapidly growing market will fuel applications in many other directions of drug development.  The proposed activity will have a broad and profound impact on society as a whole by providing valuable information that can lead to improved drug therapy and early detection of disease. The practical outcome is to improve health care and reduce costs. This project also has the potential for explosive commercial growth, which will stimulate economic development.",

The detailed technical specifications formulated in Phase I will be developed into a software solution distinctive from what is available today.  This learning tool allows the user to inquire about objects in a visualization context, where specific aspects of these objects can be manipulated.  Syandus has adapted sophisticated real-time 3D rendering technology common to video games as follows: 1) by creating the ability to interact with time driven, 3D process models of complex scientific phenomena; and 2) by associating textual information with these visualized objects and processes.  At a user's mouse click, objects intelligently reveal what they are about in deeply layered text, illustrations and linked files.  This interface can aggregate all kinds of information, such as all of a pharmaceutical company's technical information on a disease.  Finally, Syandus is building the software to be delivered across the Internet through a standard browser interface or launched from a CDROM and automatically updated via a narrowband Internet connection.\n     The differentiation among pharmaceutical products is ever increasingly grounded in rapidly evolving complex science, thus making essential a mechanism for aggregating and communicating scientific information that relates how drugs work to disease states.  Focusing on the pharmaceutical industry as the firm's first target market, Syandus proposes to create a tool to help physicians understand the breakthrough medicines to treat complex disease states that adversely impact people's lives.  The firm's custom projects will result in enduring resources for medical students, professionals and healthcare consumers. As the technology matures, the firm will pursue higher education markets.

        "abstract": "Enteral feeding is believed to be the preferred route of nutrition for critically ill, unconscious patients who have a functional gastrointestinal tract but are unable to swallow. Unfortunately, it is under-utilized because of the technical difficulties associated with transpyloric placement of the feeding tube. This research is intended to complete the development of a magnetically- guided enteral feeding tube for distal duodenum placement without the need for fluoroscopy, endoscopy, or medication, and to evaluate transferability of the new technique and device to other users. The feeding tube will have a small magnet and a magnetic field sensor at the distal end, electrically connected to a light indicator at the tube proximal end. A hand-held external magnet will be used to maneuver the tube distal end to the duodenum. The light indicator signals when the external magnet has adequately capture the tube distal end magnet, facilitating the placement procedure. A pilot study on 20 patients showed 95% success rate of duodenal placement at first attempt. A prospective study by 6 surgery resident and 6 ICU nurses using 200 tubes is planned to validate this technology. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: This innovative technology will provide a much needed device for quick enteral access, nutritional support, and administration of medication to critically ill patients at a low cost, without need for fluoroscopy or endoscopy. Duodenal placement can be established by retrieval of bile with pH of 8 without need for x-ray. This is an advantage specially in nursing hormones where x ray is not readily available. Projected cost savings for the health care system is substantial with expected better patient outcome.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This NIH Phase II SBIR proposal is to develop field-testable prototypes of a high-energy-density power source for locomotion aids for the mobility-impaired. Paraplegics, many geriatrics and people with chronic lower-limb damage need a very lightweight, powered vehicle for local transport. Existing carts are massive (50-100 kg) which precludes their transport in automobiles, taxis and in luggage racks of bus, train and aircraft. Their major mass is their batteries. Powered wheelchairs also are fitted with massive batteries, which makes difficult their vehicle transport. The batteries used universally are lead-acid (sealed or gel) which have very poor energy density (per mass) compared to new energy sources now being innovated for military and emergency service. Today the best (and most expensive) rechargeable batteries (nickel metal hydride) store only 0.25 MJ/kg (70 W-hrs/kg) and the technology is static. Now DoD is developing short-term (Y2005), 5 MJ/kg (1400 W-hrs/kg) sources for soldier-borne power. We propose to develop a field-trial alpha-prototype of our unique energy source called DICE/GEN, which is especially constructed to serve the mobility impaired. It is a hybrid engine burning an innocuous fuel (ethanol), dry lubricated (no oil) and quiet. A small battery permits use in confined spaces for one hour, with up to 8 km range. Using the engine's electrical output for propulsion and to charge the battery, provides four more hours of travel up to 10.4 mph (75 km). The hybrid energy source, including fuel, weighs 4.5 kg permitting a folding, three-wheel, scooter with seat, weighing less than 12 kg.   \n  \nSII will work with Teftec Corporation, an independent electric wheelchair manufacturer to conduct field tests with alpha-prototype DICE/GEN to verify functional equivalence to conventional batteries. With an estimated 200,000 electric wheelchairs and scooters in the U.S. market, a light weight power source should reduce overall power requirements. Development of light-weight scooter with DICE/GEN power should further improve locomotion and transportation for the mobility impaired.",

Such measurements enable crucial distinctions between simulationinfrastructure delays and human factor deficiencies of the training system.  The SNAPPY 3.0 network/human performance measurement device shall measure the latencies, provide the data in near real time, and record the data for detailed analysis later.Our proposal is based on previous successful programs that form the foundation for this low-risk, high-payoff proposal.

This proposed program will improve the functionality and extend the purview of the legacy SNAPpy latency measurement system to the High Level Architecture (HLA) simulations.     Understanding the latencies in Distributed MissionTraining (DMT) is urgent since an unknown but non-negligible latency may undercut the training, train for an erroneous system, or negate any training at all.  If the latencies are unknown and unmeasured, those responsible for the training or trainingresearch are rendered impotent to provide training or understand the factors influencing their results.We propose to develop the capability to understand simulation latencies so simulation can be more dependable and the results more predictable.

This new battery system could impact many applications and offer an environmentally benign alternative to lead acid batteries with significant performance enhancements. With the advent of ultra-low cost cathode materials, for example lithiated metal phosphates, the development of a complementary anode material is now the gating item for low-cost lithium-ion batteries. In Phase I, mixtures of transition metal oxides and tin alloy were successfully produced. The electrochemical and physical characteristics were evaluated and these materials showed excellent electrochemical performance but exhibited a high first cycle loss. Internal work on tin alloys mixed with transition metal carbides and nitrides suggests the first cycle loss could be improved through simple chemical modification of the oxide component. The Phase II work will involve development of these modified oxides to reduce first cycle loss. In addition low cost production methods will be developed for preparing the precursors and materials. Optimized electrodes for use in ultra-low cost battery prototypes will be produced and targeted for outside evaluation.\n\nCommercially, this anode material will be combined with metal phosphate cathodes to make a new class of lithium-ion batteries that are cost competitive with lead-acid batteries and maintenance free. This higher energy lead acid replacement opens up opportunities in the growing UPS and HEV markets. There are also non-commercial impacts. Any reduced use of lead acid batteries, which creates toxic waste, is beneficial to the environment. This new class of batteries would lead to the reduction of the 50,000 tons of toxic lead released due to incomplete recycling of lead-acid batteries. The development of materials that enable lithium-ion batteries to be cost competitive with lead acid batteries could give US battery manufacturers a chance to compete against the Asian dominated rechargeable battery market.",

        "abstract": "Silicon carbide power electronics are required in a variety of Air Force missions such as enabling the development of the More Electric Aircraft (MEA) and advancing the development of space-based vehicles and systems that have high temperature and highpower operating conditions. A true FBL (Fly-By-Light)/PBW (Power-By-Wire) system will require a simple lightweight interface in which components of a vehicle management system are controlled optically and powered electrically. Two light activatedtransistors based on silicon carbide are proposed in this Phase II program. A Darlington pair and an IGBT based design capable of switching current loads up to 150A will be modeled and fabricated during this program. The device design is based on systemrequirements for typical actuator control systems. A key near term goal for the program is to enable a photonic vehicle management system for the Air Force's Advanced Vehicle Management Program. Initial system analyses of vehicle management systems showthat significant weight savings may be obtained using the light activated device (up to 32 lbs per actuator). A well-focussed team with Taitech, Inc., the University of Cincinnati and CREE Research, Inc. has been assembled to pursue a path towardcommercialization of the proposed device.High power optical switches are essential for future air and space vehicles to provide improved performance without significant cost increase such as the More Electric Aircraft (MEA). Such switching technologies also are desirable for high temperatureapplications in power plants, microwave electronics for radar communications and space-based communication systems. The proposed device is essential for enabling future lightweight aircraft control systems.",

For these smokers, interventions tailored to decrease their resistance and increase their readiness to stop smoking are most effective. Motivational Interviewing (MI) focuses on overcoming resistance to change by increasing awareness that smoking is a problem, strengthening motivation, and increasing confidence that change is possible. Finally, when the patient makes a commitment to quitting, MI focuses on quitting strategies and relapse prevention. In Phase I of the Motivational Interviewing via Role-play internet-delivered Simulation (MIRIS) project, we developed an interactive multimedia simulation and tutoring environment to train healthcare professionals and students to deliver a brief motivational smoking consult for patients not ready to quit smoking. Evaluations indicate that 1) users found MIRIS to be an attractive and user-friendly tutorial and 2) MIRIS is effective in teaching brief motivational smoking cessation strategies. Phase II goals include adding audio and video, developing additional modules for working with patients at different stages of change and conducting a large teaching effectiveness study with clinicians at two medical settings.",

Reliance on these caregivers is increasing rapidly as administrators look for low-cost providers, recovery care shifts from hospitals to rehabilitation facilities, and the prevalence of chronic illnesses increase in an ever-aging population. Unfortunately, training resources are often inadequate for these caregivers who impact the quality of life of so many elderly and sick patients. The Caregiving Basic Skills Trainer (C-BST) is an interactive web-delivered multimedia tutorial designed to supplement and enhances caregiver education. CBST Phase I teaches caregivers how to perform essential caregiving skills, including Communication, Cleaning and Storing Dentures, Bed to Wheelchair Transfer, and Infection Control Practices. Cutting-edge instructional strategies encourage learners to think about the reasons behind the steps in those skills so that learning becomes more than rote memorization. Results from the usability and teaching effectiveness study indicate that learners found the software easy and enjoyable to use and significantly increased their knowledge of caregiving topics after using C-BST for just one hour. Phase II will expand the library of learning modules established in Phase I and will focus on psychosocial and communication skills. CBST II modules will include cross-cultural communication; communicating with families; the culture of aging; English as a second language (ESL) support; AIDS education, and fighting burnout. Two types of trials are planned: randomized teaching effectiveness trials comparing CBST to traditional teaching methods, and usability and utility trials in which NA students and educators will incorporate CBST into their classrooms.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator):  Research-based drug abuse prevention programs are now widely disseminated; however, adopting and implementing a research-based program does not, by itself, guarantee that desired outcomes will be achieved. Research on fidelity of implementation reveals that teachers are not sufficiently well trained in drug abuse prevention theory and practice. As a consequence, they experience difficulties even when implementing otherwise promising prevention programs. If the goals of drug abuse prevention are to be realized, teachers and other service providers need high-quality training.  This project will produce a training program for prevention professionals. The goal of this program is to improve the integrity with which a wide variety of research-based prevention programs are implemented. This goal will be achieved through the creation of a high-quality media-enhanced program. Research-based interventions each have unique characteristics; however, most share a common set of underlying concepts and methods. The research team will complete the development of six multimedia programs that address core concepts and methods of drug abuse prevention. They will also develop a manual for guiding the complete implementation of a teacher training course. The course will instruct and motivate teachers to use research-based prevention strategies effectively. As a result of this training, teachers are expected to make significant gains in understanding. Teachers are expected to implement research-based approaches to drug abuse prevention with greater competence and fidelity.  The course will be tested in a randomized field trial. Two organizations that specialize in training will deliver the course to 120 teachers; 120 teachers in a comparison condition will receive training-as-usual. The field trial will test the ability of the package to change teachers' knowledge, beliefs and intentions. A sub-study will examine changes in teaching practice.",

The HVPE technique is a well-established, cost-effective method to grow GaN (and AlGaN) epitaxial layers on sapphire andSiC substrates.  Recent advances at TDI have proven HVPE to be a reliable process for fabricating high-quality GaN-based device structures, particularly for HEMT and UV optoelectronic applications.  This versatile technique allows the fabrication of bothmulti-layer device structures with submicron layers and thick layers suitable for free-standing wafers. Until now, a multi-wafer HVPE process was not developed for group-III nitride semiconductor materials.Phase I of this project demonstrated the first multi-wafer HVPE production-type process for epitaxy of (Al)GaN. Furthermore, the novel growth zone configuration allowed for the first time fabrication of 4-inch diameter GaN epi wafers by HVPE. These resultsopen an opportunity to develop high-volume manufacturing technology for high-quality (Al)GaN epitaxial materials on 2-, 4-, and 6-inch substrates.Phase II will focus on the development of HVPE technology for high-volume production of low-defect, low-cost GaN-based 2-inch epi-wafers for high-power/frequency HEMTs and UV optoelectronic applications. An additional R&D goal is to scale this epitaxialgrowth to larger substrates, up to 6-inch in diameter.",

        "abstract": "Shaped charge warheads using reactive-metal liners have potential for increased lethality.  Reactive-metal liners are limited by low ductility and poor penetration.  In a Phase I program, Tech Energetics, Inc. (TEI) developed concepts for conical shapedcharge liners and explosively formed penetrators (EFPs) that should inject reactive metal constituents.  By metallurgically bonding metals that are good penetrators with reactive metals, liners could be manufactured to form jets which are composites of therespective metals or sequential elements.  Candidate reactive metals were selected by considering reaction feasibility, spontaneity, and potential for confined volume pressurization.  Production methods were identified.  A test plan was developed forquantifying the concepts' performance and function.  TEI successfully demonstrated prototype production of cylindrically imploded metal composites that could be used for either conical shaped charge liners or EFPs.  In a Phase II program TEI proposes tofabricate shaped charge liners, load evaluation charges, and test the function of the concepts.  Comparisons will be made to a baseline design.  Engineering guidelines will be identified and applied to the development of an optimized design.  TEI isaugmenting its capabilities with D.R. Kennedy and Associates, Inc. for design and evaluation, and Denver Research Institute for specialized testing. The DoD will obtain shaped charge liners that inject reactive materials.  The Phase II will demonstrate thefunction of the liners, provide estimates of potential performance advantages, identify requirements for manufacturing, and deliver an optimized design.  Warhead engineering, in conjunction with the manufacturing and engineering of the composite metallaminates, will provide the DoD with additional weapon capabilities.  The engineering methods developed under this SBIR will add design dimensions to shaped charge and EFP liners.",

This innovation has the potential of providing a solution to the unique airflow-matching problemimposed by the integration of a PDE with a high-speed inlet.  The cyclic (on/off) characteristic in the PDE airflow demand imposes a difficult airflow-matching problem for the inlet.  The proposed concept will serve to control the airflow to the detonationchambers, provide sealing, and function to isolate the inlet from the severe airflow disturbances that could be imposed by the PDE operation.

The objective of the proposed Phase II SBIR work effort is to demonstrate the feasibility of the rotary airflow controller for aPDE propulsion system through evaluation in a research test rig.

The expansion engine provides large cold-eng cooling capacity andallows the use of a single-stage Sterling or pulse tube cryocooler as a precooler for the low temperature cold stage.The combination of features that ELTC promised are high efficiency, low weight, compactness, high reliability, cold-end heat exchanger flexibility, low vibration, and variable load capability.  These features will provide and extraordinarily high payofffor future DoD surveillance missions.  Satellite power and heat rejection requirements will be significantly reduced, decreasing overall weight and greatly simplifying cooling system integration.

The development effort involves an integrated analytical/experimental investigation based on the fundamental principles of soil-anchor interaction.  The following objectives will be accomplished in the proposed Phase IIresearch: (1) Optimize the global anchor design with respect to uplift capacity, drivability, durability, weight and production cost; (2) Refine the optimum system design through perforation and modification of helices to enhance drivability whileretaining desirable uplift capacity, durability and economy; (3) Modify contact surfaces of the anchor through application of solid lubricants to enhance drivability through reduced soil/anchor friction, with due consideration given to system durabilityand production cost; (4) Develop manual and power-driven installation systems; (5) Develop chemical stabilizers for application of the anchor in problem soils; (6) Fully develop strategies for transfer of the technology to markets for deployablestructures; and (7) Refine the anchor system for broader geotechnical applications.Helical soil anchors will have the following tangible benefits when compared with current alternatives (wooden stakes and steel pins): (1) more than quadrupled load-carryingcapacity, and substantially enhanced wind and blast resistance; (2) rapid and convenient installation/removal, which can be power-driven; (3) reduced weight and bulk; (4) competitive cost; (5) good long-term durability; and (6) compatibility with existingarmy shelter-to-anchor attachment systems.

To assure that this effect does not adversely affect performance, further study of electron effects in regimes relevant to heavy-ion fusion is needed.  Computer modeling is the most widely used method for studying the problem, but the codes used in the heavy-ion fusion community do not have the capability of studying the electron cloud effect.  This project will develop a complete set of computational modules for studying electron effects in accelerators.  These modules will provide heavy-ion fusion simulation codes with access to the most recent experimental data and numerical routines for modeling the electron cloud effect.   In Phase I, initial computational modules were implemented in one of the primary heavy-ion fusion research codes.  The code was then used to model recent beam physics experiments in heavy-ion fusion.  The need for other data and modules was determined.  In Phase II, the implementation of the Phase I prototype modules will be completed.  The modules will be made portable to all major platforms and all major heavy ion fusion research codes.  A user-friendly interface to, and documentation for, the modules will be developed.

In Phase I, nonplanar boundaries, particle emission, and resistive boundaries were prototyped.  Results were shown to agree with theoretical expectations.  In Phase II, the above features will be made robust and enhanced:  nonplanar boundaries will be extended to three dimensions, new particle emission algorithms will be incorporated to study multipacting, resistive walls will be enhanced, lossy dielectrics will be added, the geometric specification of domain decomposition and three-dimensional objects will be improved, and user friendliness will be improved.

Due to its superior spatial and temporal resolution in addition to being non-invasive, fMRI is fast becoming the method of choice for studying systems level neuroscience of the human brain. fMRI is currently being used extensively to characterize and map sensory, motor, and cognitive function in healthy subjects as well as patients. The objective of this proposal is to develop statistical processing strategies to quantify differences in the fMRI response in cortical regions of the brain in subjects with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) compared with age- and gender - matched controls and to test the hypothesis that statistically significant differences in the fMRI task-induced response, including both signal magnitudes and spatial extent of activation, exist in AD subjects compared with controls. As steps in testing this hypothesis three specific aims will be achieved: (1) reduction of noise arising from head motion, (2) development of non-parametric statistical methods suitable for this problem, and (3) analysis of shapes of task-activated regions coupled with analysis of anatomic variability. \n\nData from several subjects together with data from several age- and gender-matched controls has already been acquired and will be used to test analysis methods to be developed here.A rigorous statistical processing strategy that in addition to quantifying differences in fMR images between AD and matched controls will permit determination of the relative contribution from the various sources that result in differences in task activation response is proposed in this project. This may provide a basis for the use of fMRl in diagnosis and severity of AD. Differences due to different tasks from the same subject group can also be studied using the methods proposed in this project.",

The software identifies, integrates, and then systematically upgrades common elements of major research codes, to yield a versatile high-order software suite that can be used tosimulate, in a coupled fashion, various elements of turbulence, electromagnetics, aeroacoustics, magnetogasdynamics, fluid-structure interaction, and chemically reacting flows.  An elegant and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) will be developed, byleveraging experience derived from our flagship product INSTED. TTC's new tightly integrated and versatile product will reduce the simulation time by orders of magnitude and drastically reduce design cost of modern engineering systems requiringmulti-disciplinary optimization. The tool will facilitate out-of-the-box approaches by providing a validated realistic virtual environment and thus impact all major thrusts of the Air Vehicles Directorate, including access-to-space, sustainment, andunmanned air vehicles.",

Prestress induces compression in the interior surface to prevent delamination and tension micro cracks. This was observed as abyproduct of prior cryogenic testing and further demonstrated in Phase I. Most polymers exhibit increased stiffness at cryogenic temperatures. Stiffness limits the polymer's ability to distribute loads to the high-modulus fibers.

The value in establishing drug-free workplace programs is well documented. The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA) findings indicate that companies with such programs are associated with lower prevalence rates of current illicit drug use and heavy alcohol use among workers. For a variety of reasons, small businesses tend not to deal with drug and alcohol issues. Consequently, as the NHSDA reports, the cost of drug use is disproportionately burdensome to small and medium businesses where 87% of illicit drug users are employed full-time. Using The Walsh Group's broad experience in establishing drug-free workplaces, we propose to take the critical elements of a model program and develop an Internet-based interactive site. Linking the cost effectiveness of a drug-free workplace with the user friendly and popular environment of the Internet should prove to reduce barriers and provide small businesses with the necessary information and services to develop and implement a program. Furthermore, we intend to develop a mechanism to evaluate the use of the website and utilize the information to demonstrate the feasibility and commercial viability of the concept.",

        "abstract": "The survivability of Army vehicles depends upon proper thermal management. The control of exhaust gases is critical to thermal management, particularly for lightweight vehicles, such as Future Combat Systems (FCS), whose survivability relies on signaturecontrol. If not managed skillfully, exhaust gases can be a large signature cue - leading to the detection and targeting of assets. Equally disastrous to vehicle survivability is the impingement of exhaust on vehicle parts and on surrounding terrain.Materials exposed to exhaust gas impingement will heat up, thus becoming signature cues. Exhaust impingement is also a safety hazard for military/commercial applications, affecting both crew well-being and vehicle integrity. Another safety concern is thedanger resulting from an exhaust system leak. A predictive tool, suited for design and rapid prototyping applications, is needed to address these concerns. Currently, no such tool exists. ThermoAnalytics proposes to build upon the RadTherm thermal analysiscode, currently in use at Ford, GM, and DaimlerChrysler, and part of the Army's Multi Services Electro-optics Signature (MuSES) suite, to create an exhaust impingement prediction tool. The tool will provide feedback during vehicle design as well as producerealistic images of the vehicle embedded in natural environments for sensor simulation of prototype vehicle designs.1. Signature management - Exhaust impingement on vehicle parts and terrain can be a significant cue for threat sensors. Predicting theperformance of exhaust systems during the design process can dramatically reduce the signature and survivability of Army systems. 2. Thermal management - Impingement of the exhaust on vehicle parts can greatly increase the thermal load and stress that avehicle will be subjected to. Crew health and alertness may also be impacted. Addressing the impingement issue is best done during the design process. 3. Safety - Exhaust system leaks can lead to catastrophic failure of the vehicle. This design tool wouldallow safety engineers to analyze the effect of exhaust leaks. 4. Impingement mitigation - The exhaust from vehicles - both ground and air - as well as from APUs can be directed downward. Impingement of hot exhaust gases can destroy concrete and meltasphalt. With this tool, these impingement effects can be anticipated resulting in a proactive design. 5. Sensor and detector simulation - This tool allows the generation of realistic imagery of the vehicle embedded and interacting with the environment.Such imagery is vital for detection, targeting, and survivability assessment of Army designs.",

The aim of the system is to teach poor comprehenders metacognitive strategies which have demonstrated efficacy in increasing comprehension. With Phase II funding, 31 different science-oriented texts at five different decoding levels will be created. As students read through the texts they receive four opportunities to work on either a verbal strategy (create a question) or a visual strategy (interactively move images on the screen to facilitate the creation of a mental model). Students' questions are immediately scored by a proprietary on-line essay scoring algorithm. The visual imagery is also scored immediately and both of these scores are are shown to the students as feedback to enhance subsequent performance. At the end of the text, the students are asked eight open-ended questions. Their constructed answers are scored by the online algorithm. The on-line essay scoring algorithm is a valuable asset of the system which allows for assessment that moves away from the rigid, one-correct answer multiple choice format. 3D-Readers has been piloted with middle school poor readers, in the within-subjects design, students first read three texts on the computer without the embedded strategies. In the control condition, students unscrambled anagrams, in the final four experimental sessions students read texts that contained the embedded metacognitive verbal and visual strategies. The students scored higher on the experimental comprehension questions, t(19) = 3.05, p = .007. Text order and time-on-task were controlled for. The results indicate that working on strategies aided the readers in science-oriented text comprehension. In Phase II, a larger, between-subjects design will be implemented with elementary and high school-aged children reading 31 texts. The 3D-Readers system is appropriate for poor comprehenders, but it is also appropriate for gifted students who may want to tackle more difficult texts. It would also be of service to certain literacy-challenged adult populations who may have struggled with higher-level comprehension and/or science issues in the past.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anticoagulation of blood is necessary for prevention of clotting and/or thromboembolism during cardiopulmonary bypass or other procedures that require extracorporeal circulation. Conventionally, anticoagulation is achieved by administering heparin and reversed by neutralizing heparin with protamine. Both of these procedures may have potential pathological consequences. A subpopulation of patients is known to be sensitive to protamine, and heparin itself has been shown to cause thrombocytopenia in a subpopulation of patients undergoing open heart surgery. This is proposal to refine and develop an alternative to the heparin-protamine strategy. A novel device, termed clotting factor filter (CFF) has been developed that will bind and transiently remove clotting factors from circulating blood. Blood from which clotting factors have been removed would neither form clots nor thromboemboli during extracorporeal circulation, thus achieving the same effect as intended with heparin. Hypocoagulable blood gradually returns to normal state when the procedure is stopped, or recovery can be accelerated and normal hemostasis restored immediately by transfusion of autologous blood or plasma. Preliminary Phase I studies have confirmed the safety and efficacy of CFF approach. The objective of this Phase II proposal include: optimization of the CFF, characterization and performance of the optimized system, and verification that the CFF is able to effect appropriate 'anticoagulation' safely during cardiopulmonary bypass in an animal model. For the active matrix, linkers and base substrates will be investigated. For the plasma-matrix contact system, optimal column geometry will be selected, and a high-flow plasma separator will be designed. The optimal CFF system will be characterized to ascertain required level of 'anticoagulation' that will eliminate thrombosis during ECC. Finally, a porcine CPB model will be utilized to test the safety and efficacy of the CFF approach for 'anticoagulation' of blood during bypass. This will include careful assessment of hematologic and cardiovascular parameters during the procedure and during long term survival of the animal to assure that CFF approach is efficacious and safe.",

The industry is moving to \u00c2\u00bfkeyhole\u00c2\u00bf access to repair these pipelines because of safety, reliability, and cost benefits.   The critical first step in gas line maintenance and repair is to stop the flow of natural gas.  This typically is achieved by \u00c2\u00bfsqueezing off\u00c2\u00bf the gas flow with PE pipe squeeze-off tools.  However, no tools are currently available for squeezing-off 4 and 6 inch PE pipes through keyhole access.  This project will develop, demonstrate, and manufacture an innovative \u00c2\u00bfsqueeze-off\u00c2\u00bf tool that can safely squeeze-off these large diameter polyethylene pipes through keyhole access.  In Phase I, a \u00c2\u00bfsqueeze-off\u00c2\u00bf test tool was designed, fabricated, and field tested for large (4\u00c2\u00bf and 6\u00c2\u00bf) diameter polyethylene natural gas pipe.  The squeeze-off tool exceeded performance expectations in the field tests, and was received enthusiastically by utility representatives.  Phase II will optimize the design of an engineered prototype squeeze-off tool. Four units will be fabricated and rigorously tested in laboratory and field-test environments, and then used in natural gas utility operations.      Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The new squeeze-off tool should provide the \u00c2\u00bfkeyhole\u00c2\u00bf technology needed for safe, reliable, and cost effective repair of polyethylene pipe, ensuring the integrity and reliability of the Nation\u00c2\u00bfs gas distribution network.

        "abstract": "The proposed program is designed to design, optimize and experimentally demonstrate the generation of efficient coherent tunable THz radiation both in the continuous and pulsed regimes using photonic band gap technology. The electromagnetic spectrum in theband between 100 GHz and 30 THz is the terahertz regime, which lies between the microwave and infrared spectral regions. In the past the Terahertz regime was too high for affordable devices, due to the technological limits in reducing the size ofcomponents as frequency increases. Researchers have applied photonic techniques to generate radiation in this regime. Despite the important advances made in THz technology most techniques require pulsed laser sources and the conversion efficiency into THzradiation has been low. Clearly, there is a need for a cost effective and efficient coherent Continuous Wave THz output covering the THz band. TDC proposes to use multiplayer semiconductor photonic band gap structures to efficiently generate THz radiationvia frequency down conversion by the nonlinear mixing process of two nearly degenerate laser beams. The proposed design is based on the band edge or defect-mode filed enhancement phenomena near a photonic band gap.",

This proof ofconcept was accomplished using TDC's first generation PulsON 100 chipset demonstration radio system.  Recently, TDC's second generation chipset, the PulsON 200, was successfully tested.  The P200 chipset implements many performance improvements in thisbreakthrough technology and is capable of a ten-fold increase in data rate.  In Phase II, TDC proposes to integrate P200 technology into a communication system for the Gladiator UGV and demonstrate the significant benefits of a low power, pulsed UWB radiosystem over conventional RF.  This project will develop and test a prototype UWB radio that transmits control, status, and video data between an operator and a Gladiator UGV platform.  Further development during an option period will accomplish positionawareness and networking capability for the radio. Radio linked UGVs could enable effective military operations and reduce risk to warfighters operating in hazardous environments.  Compared to conventional radios, UWB technology offers the advantages ofvery low power, low probability of detection, low probability of interception, reliable operation in the presence of high multipath, inherent ranging, and spectrum sharing.  Because low power, pulsed UWB has been widely recognized as one of the mostpromising wireless technologies for this decade, its early research and development has been funded by venture capitalists.  With investors such as Seimens, SONY, and US West, the Navy can be confident that TDC is zealously pursuing commercialapplications.  The anticipated benefit to America's warfighters is availability of commercial UWB communication products that will have a low probability of intercept while offering",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 200,000 Americans will require ACL reconstructive surgery in 2001 with a price tag exceeding 5 billion dollars. The ACL serves as a primary stabilizer of the knee and is most often susceptible to rupture or tear resulting from a flexion-rotation-valgus force associated with sports injuries. Tissue engineering can potentially provide improved clinical options in orthopaedic medicine through the generation of biologically based functional tissues in vitro for transplantation at the time of injury or disease. A tissue engineered ACL with the appropriate biological and mechanical properties available at the time of reconstruction would eliminate the limitations associated with present day surgical techniques, i.e., eliminate the need for autologous patellar or hamstring tendon harvest and/or provide a unlimited source of allogenic ligaments. The elimination of the major debilitating side effect of current treatment--donor-site morbidity--would drastically improve patient outcomes. The overall goal of this project is to engineer viable autologous tissue engineered ACLs eliminating the need for current autologous hamstring or patellar tendon harvest. The final outcome of Phase II will be an engineered ligament ready for human clinical trials. Tissue Regeneration Inc., (TRI) preliminary studies and Phase I results demonstrate the potential of an innovative tissue engineered ligament to serve as a viable replacement for torn or ruptured ACLs in vivo. Specifically, a novel silk fiber-based matrix has been identified, designed and developed, and when seeded with human bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs), supports the specific development of ligament tissue. This tissue expresses biocompatible, biochemical and biomechanical relevant traits to be expected for an ACL. Based on these Phase I studies, we propose to further explore the relationship between a rigorous in vivo intra-articular environment and resulting ACL tissue development (both histomorphologically and mechanically). This study will elucidate key structure-function relationships between initial engineered ACL properties (e.g., matrix linear stiffness) and the in vivo intra-articular remodeling cascade. The potential to restore ACL and knee joint functionality will be determined and assessed in relation to established Phase II milestones in order to reach a \"go/no go\" for Phase III (human clinical trials) and eventual commercial markets.",

TomoTherapy's first FDA cleared product, the HiArt System, combines, for the first time, the means to accurately plan, deliver, verify and review treatments for cancer therapy, and as a result, to greatly improve treatment results and lifestyles of cancer patients because of the better targeting of irradiation to the tumor and the sparing of normal tissue. This \"entire radiotherapy department in a machine\" integration and automation greatly reduces the need for human intervention, thus reducing staff needs for cancer treatment.  \n  \nThe HiArt System employs image-guided radiation delivery, enabling tumors to be irradiated more effectively while saving the critical organs surrounding the tumor. Central to the capability of image-guided radiotherapy is a detector system that efficiently detects high energy x-rays employed in cancer therapy. The objective of the proposed project is to develop a new type of megavoltage detector system that meets all the requirements of tomotherapy imaging applications. The proposed design combines i) amorphous selenium (a-Se) material which has seen extensive research and development in applications ranging from imaging and display, to radiology and astronomy, with ii) TomoTherapy's patented technology for improving detection efficiency for high energy x-rays. This new detector system will improve the detection efficiency, a key requirement for an imaging detector, over the existent technology by an order of magnitude, thus offering great improvement in resolving power on the images. When employed, the multi-row approach and the improved detection efficiency and readout speed of the new detector will improve the tomotherapy imaging quality and throughput significantly, and offers great potential for imaging the patient in real-time during treatment, a key element for further improving cancer treatment where organ motion is a significant obstacle to improved precision. It is expected that the proposed detector will also save $10 to $20 million in tomotherapy manufacturing cost yearly. This technology also has potential applications in other areas as well, including security inspections at ports, forest inspections and orthopedic imaging where there are implanted metal devices or joints.",

Using conventionalmirror/director technologies, the cost and weight of these systems would be prohibitive.  In addition, conventional materials, such as glass, offer insufficient stiffness, and their performance is adversely affected by vibration and thermal serviceconditions.  The use of coal-based carbon foam as a structural and support material is proposed.  The coal-based foam can be tailored with regard to stiffness and thermal expansion and can be graded in density and pore structure through its thickness toprovide localized stiffness and thermal expansion control while maintaining an overall weight-efficient structure.  Carbon foams' unique combination of properties can provide the properties of high stiffness, light weight and low thermal expansion requiredfor mirror/directors as well as mounts, optical benches and support structures.  Precursor selection and blending will be studied to optimize foam characteristics while processing parameters and alternate processing methods will be investigated.  Productuniformity and manufacturing times and cost will be evaluated as prototype applications are developed and qualified. Carbon, when graphitic and highly ordered as in fiber or deposited film forms, can exhibit unmatched stiffness and thermal stability (e.g., near-zero thermal expansion).  Carbon foams can provide similar performance to woven or knitted carbon fiber formsat a fraction of the cost and with significantly greater design/use flexibility.  Optical systems based on these foams can be designed in terms of stiffness, thermal expansion, and density - even on localized scales.  Demonstration that foam composites canbe used in space-based optical systems - controlling structure stiffness and thermal expansion and surviving exposure to launch conditions, thermal cycling, vibration, and high-temperature oxidation - will aid in carbon foam insertion into otherspace-based and/or optical structures.

Our approach is to treat the problem as a closed-loop feedback system where a fusionand tracking process works with a dynamic sensor-tasking module (DSTM) to maximize the amount of information contained in a track database. The amount of information is quantified using an objective function such as the information-theoretic definition ofthe expected entropy in the track database given a candidate sensor schedule. The domain of sensor tasks involves a range of different radar modes and wave-forms for the radar, the pointing location and zoom control of the EOTS, and the activities of theIFF portion of the CNI system. In order to evaluate the sensor-tasking module, we will enhance a JSF model within the SLAMEMT simulation with the assistance of our subcontractor Lock-heed-Martin. Additionally, we will work with Lockheed-Martin to implementthe DSTM within a JSF/Lockheed-Martin simulation. We will demonstrate the operation of the tasking algorithm in real time for a scenario selected in cooperation with the Navy and JSF staff. The successful completion of this research will result in thedevelopment of a sensor manager that supports the location and identification of ground vehicles. This will be useful for many military applications in addition to civilian uses such as border patrol, counter-drug and counter-terrorist operations, andfishery law enforcement.",

The Phase I demonstrated TPL's ability to continuously produce capacitor grade film and Aerovox's ability to incorporateTPL's polymer/paper dielectric into wound capacitors.  Measured performance of these model devices demonstrated that energy densities greater than 2.5 'J/co can be achieved, a performance two times greater than polypropylene capacitor technology.TPL, in collaboration with Aerovox Corporation, proposes a Phase 1I effort for continued capacitor development using TPL's polymer/paper film.  Specific government and commercial pulsed power applications will be targeted.  Film and capacitor fabricationwill be scaled for prototype evaluations.

However, current flowmeter technology requires that animals be tethered to recording hardware. This puts the animal and the surgical instrumentation investment at risk, while the stressful experimental setting may alter flow. Transonic Systems will resolve this problem by developing a miniaturized; battery powered wireless flowmeter compatible with existing, and chronically implantable flow probes. Small enough to be implanted in larger animals or attached as a \"backpack\" to the rat, it will transmit real-time flow from free-roaming animals. Its accuracy will match current benchtop flowmeters; its low power consumption will enable chronic studies. During Phase-I bench/animal tests demonstrated the feasibility and performance of new flowmeter circuitry that can be converted into a custom low-power flowmeter chipset. The Phase-II research will implement/validate a flowmeter LSI chipset that can be integrated with off-the-shelf telemetry chips, and can run for 100 hours on a coin-cell battery. During Phase-Ill commercialization we will market the chip-set to research instrumentation manufacturers for integration with existing telemetry systems, and also to the growing number of medical device manufacturers needing low-power flowmetry for implanted LVAD/mechanical heart devices.",

Phase I results showed that the new approach has the potential to measure soils properties needed to evaluate the mass density and water content of soils.The proposed methodology differs from current measurement practices that use old techniques such as sand cone method and nuclear gauge to determine the field density and oven-dried soil samples to calculate the field water content.  Such techniques involvetime consuming processes, inaccuracies, and the handling of regulated materials (i.e., nuclear moisture-density apparatus).  The army field units and the engineering market are in a desperate need for a modern, robust, and fast device to accurately measurethe field density and in-situ water content of natural and compacted soils. These measurements are essential in many applications such as assessing site suitability for deploying heavy mobile equipment, vehicle-soil traction calculations, highwayconstruction, earthwork projects, etc.  Therefore, the development of such a device is expected to have wide applications and a major practical impact and cost cutting in the operations of engineering units of the Department of Defense and civilengineering construction projects.For Phase II, the research team proposes to build the first self-contained prototype for the rapid measurement of the in-situ density and water content.  As part of this proposed activity, several parallel studies will be performed. These studies includeevaluation of the sensors compatibilities, selection of the proper electronics, improvement of the inversion algorithm, development of the software program for the self-contained prototype, and a parametric field analysis to evaluate the developed device.Electronic equipment and sensors for the proposed device include a TDR system, miniature piezoelectric accelerometer, signal conditioning systems, and oscilloscope for data acquisition.  The research team envisages that the developed device will bebattery-powered and will have a total weight of about 122.6 N (26 lbs).The successful completion of the prototype and the future commercialization of the product will give the engineers in the military and in the construction community a fast, reliable, and safe alternative to measure two important soil parameters.",

The shorter timescales required as well as the need to rapidly incorporate operationalelements demanded by these applications bring new challenges. In particular, cost reduction in SNE development using parameterized scenario generation with compositional modeling is the core problem that needs to be addressed. Component-based developmentof complex SNE components requires domain-specific repository organization with intelligent component retrieval mechanisms along with reasoning methods for conflict identification before component assembly. Furthermore, merging disparate SNE componentsneeds sophisticated schema interoperability analysis, diagnosis, and merge tools. We propose an ontology-oriented Web-based SNE retrieval and fusion framework to support a component-based SNE development lifecycle. Specifically, DARPA Agent Markup Language(DAML), the ontology language of Semantic Web, is utilized to uniformly specify the service profiles of environmental models and SNE terrain data components. The framework builds on DAML and constitutes: (1) an ontology engineering subsystem, (2) anagent-based distributed ontology broker infrastructure, built on Trident's InterchangeSE - Object Oriented Data Repository, for SNE publishing, discovery, and retrieval, (3) diagnosis methods for SNE component certification before publishing, and (4)ontology merge and fusion mechanisms.The major programs that will be supported by the proposed effective representation and rapid synthetic natural environment derivation are: (1) advance concept development and defense planning, (2) R&D, acquisition, andmilitary doctrine development, and (3) training, exercise, and military operations user domains. Other domains exist that would enjoy the advancements in rapid generation and certification of synthetic environments.

        "abstract": "The goal of the Foliage Penetration Interferometric SAR (IFSAR)project is the development of an IFSAR prototype using low-cost,commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components for automatic targetrecognition on UAV operations.  In order to expand the IFSARutility to UAVs in today's military, a number of hurdles must beovercome.  First, a low-power and compact prototype must beprovided due to the limited payload and power resources on aUAV.   Next, a low-cost and pseudo real-time design is highlydemanded in military UAV operations because they can becontinuously integrated and upgraded with the advent of newdevelopment.   During the Phase I effort, Trident successfullyaccomplished (1) algorithm development and performance analysis;and (2) prototyping a low-cost and implementable radar.   Tridentproposes to continue development of the IFSAR prototype byinvestigating all implementation aspects, augmenting andimproving existing techniques and manipulation capabilities, andintegrating COTS components.  Phase II will include seven majortask areas which collectively represent an aggressive, success-oriented approach culminating in the production of a functionalprototype suitable for evaluation and testing in simulated andreal-world environments.  In addition, the development processwill ensure the existence of migration paths for Phase IIIapplications of the resulting technology. The successful completion of this Phase II effort will significantly advance the capability to portray a low cost, high performance, low power, portable, compact, high speed, and digital radar system.  Thetechnology developed during Phase II can be readily adapted to existing and planned systems.  Specific military and commercial applications include a hand held SAR tool, airport airborne reconnaissance systems, surveillance and air traffic control, andenvironmental monitoring devices.",

        "abstract": "The military has incorporated an increasing amount of information technology into battlefield systems, and has grown to increasingly rely on the Global Positioning System (GPS) for key tasks including navigation, targeting, and situational awareness (SA).Many situations, however, require the use of this battlefield technology when GPS reception is poor-MOUT operations, in caves & tunnel networks, or due to combinations of tree cover, weather, and local geography.   The resulting loss of navigation abilitycan have a serious impact on mission success for both manned and unmanned missions.  An alternative system would allow the extension of navigation capabilities into these areas, relying on range estimation between stationary ground transponders, placed byhand by a user along a path, and used as a return-path guidance system.  Implementation using emerging UWB communications technology, along with advanced miniature packaging techniques, could potentially make these transponders very small and inexpensive.A small handheld device would be used to communicate with the transponders, calculating the user's position based on signals received.  Trident Systems will leverage its extensive background with tactical communications, map-based software tooldevelopment, signal processing, and embedded and RF system integration and design, to develop a practical system solution.  The successful completion of this project will provide the Army with a powerful battlefield navigation tool for GPS-free navigationand mapping of enclosed areas.  The system can also help mitigate the effects of poor communications connectivity, and enhance operational effectiveness.  It would also provide a valuable tool for UGV navigation in enclosed areas, greatly increasing rangeon surveillance, ordinance disposal, mine detection, and rescue missions.  The resulting system would be immediately applicable to other military services (USMC, SOCOM), and has direct application for a variety of commercial markets, including perimetersecurity, search and rescue, underground exploration, and autonomous mobile robotic navigation.",

        "abstract": "The battlefield of the future will be dominated by complex and time-varying networks of sensors, soldiers and systems that share rich, real-time streams of situation awareness and force status information.  To support these functions, many militaryapplications require multicast transmission to properly and efficiently operate. Standard IP multicast, however, is unreliable, and does not have any mechanisms to support geographic-based routing.  New secure and reliable adhoc protocols are needed tooptimize location-aware, sensor-equipped munitions or other smart sensor networks used in FCS and MOSAIC.Trident Systems has developed, under SBIR funding, a reliable multicast protocol, intended for the Army's tactical networks.  The Wireless Reliable Multicast (WiReM) provides reliable multicast transfer at the transport and networks layers. WiReM utilizesa dynamic self-configuring routing capability that works well in ad hoc environments.Under the Phase I effort, we researched and developed approaches for implementing Geographic awareness and power-consciousness in WiReM.  The Geographically-aware WiReM (GeoWiReM) protocol is a logical evolution of our reliable multicast research. Weproposed to augment the WiReM mesh-building algorithm with geographic information, and coupled this with power-awareness mechanisms to control required transmission power. GeoWiReM will also provide prioritization and preemption mechanisms to supportcritical messages in sensor networks.A reliable multicast protocol will provide guaranteed and efficient dissemination of critical information and enable power conservation in resource-limited sensor networks.  The proposed protocol will provide secure andreliable ad hoc routing to optimize location-aware, sensor-equipped munitions or any smart sensor networks while supporting Quality of Service (QOS) criteria.A Geographically-aware reliable multicast protocol has commercial applications as well. Wireless communications service provides can use a geographically-aware reliable multicasting protocol that will be able to deliver information togeographically-specific regions.  Also, federal and local law enforcement agencies may utilize sensor networks enabled with GeoWiReM to support undercover operations.",

The Army's mission for this lightweight high thermal performance mortar is based on the company level requirement of high firepower, extended range and un-mounted infantry transport.  The barrel section was fabricated usingan aluminum matrix composite (AMC) structural jacket with a proprietary functionally graded metal ceramic matrix composite (MCMC) structure with a fully dense ceramic matrix composite liner.  The structural jacket was fabricated from fiber-reinforcedaluminum that demonstrated excellent tensile strength at temperatures exceeding 1000\u00c2\u00bfF, a high tensile strength of 200 ksi, and a low density of 3.4 g/cc.  The Phase I program demonstrated through analysis, design and testing, the feasibility of usingthese high specific strength composite materials to achieve the required weight reduction and thermal management under the high firing rates in an 81-mm mortarThe Advanced Composite Mortar developed on the Phase I program is expected to have a directimpact on the M252 mortar by reducing the overall weight and barrel soak temperature.

        "abstract": "70277S02-II     Micro- and optoelectronics, and micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) integration often requires placing thin layers of different materials on a substrate or self-supporting thin layer.  This cannot always be achieved by standard thin film deposition processes such as sputtering or pulsed laser deposition because of limitations due to lattice mismatch, interdiffusion, and/or interfacial chemical reaction.  This project will develop ion beam techniques for layer splitting and transfer onto a desired substrate for device applications.  In Phase I, LiNbO3 and PbZn1/3Nb2/3O3 \u00c2\u00bf PbTiO3 (PZN-PT) layers were separated by implanting MeV He and H ions and either chemical etching or rapid thermal annealing.  The mechanism of layer separation was studied using optical and transmission electron microscopic techniques.  A monomorph piezo-actuator based on separated PZN-PT film was fabricated and evaluated.  Phase II will: (1) optimize the parameters for efficient and cost-effective layer separation of LiNbO3, PZN-PT and PbMg1/3Nb2/3O3-PbTiO3 (PMN-PT), (2) understand the mechanism of layer separation of metal-oxides, (3) develop techniques for bonding the separated layers on silicon and other substrates, and (4) fabricate devices.     Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The technology should enable the integration of photonic circuits and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) with various devices and materials.  New systems applications would take advantage of the chip-level integration of electronic, photonic, and MEMS with integrated multiple functions.",

        "abstract": "No timely and cost-effective methods now exist for the fabrication of continuous fiber-reinforced ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) of complex geometries. Application of such CMCs can potentially enhance the efficiency and performance, reduce the weight,improve the durability, and lower the cost of aerospace propulsion systems, particularly those used in high temperature, high-stress environments. Achieving these benefits requires development of fiber preform production and matrix infiltration techniquescapable of efficiently producing net or near-net shape parts to eliminate the need for costly and time-consuming machining in the final production step. The quality of such parts will also depend on implementation of improved fiber/matrix interfaces andinterface deposition techniques to weaken the bond between the fiber and matrix and maximize the degree of slip at that interface, a key mechanism for load transfer and overall CMC strength. This feature is key to both oxidation-resistant ceramic fibersand for many projected applications in which carbon fibers are of particular interest as CMC reinforcements due to their relatively low cost, high strength and stiffness, and low density compared to oxide or non-oxide ceramic fibers. The main drawback ofcarbon fibers, however, is their low oxidation resistance, which has prevented their extensive use in high temperature oxidizing environments. Oxide interfaces can potentially impart sufficient protection, as well as provide other essential interfacefunctions, for carbon as well as ceramic fibers. In previous work, Ultramet demonstrated a unique and innovative process for depositing oxide interfaces, specifically ultraviolet-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (UVCVD). Ultramet has also successfullyachieved rapid infiltration of carbide matrices within thin (",

        "abstract": "A key design limitation of many current electronic systems is heat rejection. As microchips become ever more densely packed with greater quantities of components, the amount of heat generated per unit area likewise increases rapidly. As the junctiontemperatures within an electronic component increase, the reliability and useful lifetime of the device decrease rapidly, even silicon carbide (SiC) components. In Phase I, Ultramet modeled, designed, fabricated, and tested lightweight, low-cost,high-performance heat sinks for actively cooled high-power SiC-based electronics. This new heat sink used open-cell silicon carbide foam as its key component, which functioned as a high thermal conductivity, high surface area cooling fin. SiC was chosendue to its high thermal conductivity, excellent corrosion resistance, and perfect thermal expansion match with SiC-based electronics. Heat transfer testing was performed both with and without foam, and the data showed that for a given heat flux and coolantflow rate, the foam-based heat sinks yielded junction temperatures 300-450\u00c2\u00bfC lower than those without foam. Similarly, for a given Reynolds number, the measured heat transfer coefficients were one to two orders of magnitude greater when foam was present.In Phase II, Ultramet proposes to further study the properties of these foams and work with leading RF component manufacturers and users to design, build, and test systems for use with ultrahigh-power SiC-based electronics. Commercial applications foradvanced heat sinks for electronic components include military and civilian radar, military, civil, and commercial satellites, manned and unmanned spacecraft, military and commercial aircraft, and mainframe and even personal computers, to name just a few.With the rapid growth of the electronics industry and the ever-increasing power density of integrated circuits, the need for advanced electronic heat sinks will only increase.",

This project will provide improved access to these data, by providing convenient search and extraction software and an efficient graphical user interface, by researching and reformatting the documentation to consolidate all information relating to individual variables in one place, and by providing software to facilitate longitudinal analysis. The product will be distributed on CD-ROM and via the Internet, and run on PCs under Windows. In this project, in consultation with the Census Bureau, current and potential SIPP users, and a highly qualified consultant, SIPP Utilities and SPD Utilities will be designed and released, building on Unicon's long-established CPS Utilities. To enable researchers to utilize these tools as soon as possible, preliminary releases will take place early in this project, embodying data from recent SlPP panels and SPD surveys.

New sources of solid state lighting, based on high efficiency phosphorescent organic light emitting devices (PHOLEDs) offer the potential for significant energy savings and other environmental benefits.  This project will further develop two novel approaches to use high efficiency PHOLEDs to produce white lighting sources.  The first approach uses a single dopant electrophosphorescent organic light emitting device that produces white light through the formation of two distinct monomer and excimer emitting species.  In the second approach, low-cost, high-efficiency, general illumination OLED light sources, comprising a series of striped PHOLEDs, will be fabricated.   Phase 1 demonstrated the technical feasibility of the two novel approaches to produce white lighting sources.  Specifically, with fabricated striped R-G-B light sources, it was demonstrated that stripe widths of 2mm appear featureless through a diffuser and that stripe pitches of 0.5mm will not present undesirable features as a lighting source.  Also, a monomer-excimer single dopant white light source achieved greater than 8 lm/W at 500 cd/m2, and a path to achieve >100 lm/W with PHOLEDs was designed.  Phase II will:  (1) demonstrate a monomer-excimer based white PHOLED light source on a glass substrate with an efficiency of 20 lm/W at a luminance of 800 cd/m2; (2) further develop white PHOLED light sources based on a series of monochrome striped light sources to achieve the same performance; and (3) demonstrate and deliver 6\u00c2\u00bf x 6\u00c2\u00bf prototype lighting panels based on both striped and monomer-excimer PHOLED lighting sources.

Universal Display Corporation (UDC) is developing advanced organic light emitting diode (OLED) technology based ontheir proprietary high-efficiency phosphorescent devices. For HMDs, OLEDs can simplify the optical design and number of elements, reducing weight, size and cost for improved human factors and user acceptance.  UDC has also developed expertise in thedesign, development and fabrication of transparent OLEDs (TOLEDTM), and flexible OLEDs (FOLEDTM).Phase II will extend Phase I to demonstrate key components of a transparent, conformable active matrix OLED (AMOLED) display. We will fabricate demonstration devices with low address line resistivity and high optical transmissivity, using technologycompatible with low temperature conformable substrates. We will deliver monochrome video-rate transparent AMOLED displays, and address their fabrication enabling conformability in 2 dimensions, with a target radius of curvature of 10cm. To the best of ourknowledge, these deliverables will represent the first demonstration of these novel technologies, and in combination will advance OLED display technology in new directions, enabling a truly revolutionary emissive display -- a high efficiency, highresolution transparent and conformable AMOLED display for advanced HMD applications.The successful outcome of this Program will create myriad benefits in a variety of potential military and commercial applications.  It will provide the U.S Army with a clearly demonstrated technology path for transparent, conformable displays for HMDapplications.  Beyond current U.S. Army application, HMDs are increasingly being designed into industrial, medical and, even, consumer applications where conformable, transparent displays offer desirable features. Additionally, transparency andconformability have the potential to create a host of novel display products and market opportunities beyond those currently envisioned for existing display markets.  For example, these include avionic and automotive applications for conformed instrumentpanel displays and windscreen-integrated head-up displays.  Moreover, replacing glass with plastic substrates improves ruggedness and safety in addition to reducing weight,  extremely attractive features in these applications.  Transparency enables overlaydisplays to be incorporated into cockpits and automobile windshields.  Display Search now projects a $1.7B billion market for OLEDs in 2005, growing to $2.8B in 2007.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II proposal develops two independent but complementary technologies that, when combined, provide up to an 8-fold increase in speed of analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion with high-resolution, wide dynamic range performance.The Advanced Filter Bank (AFB) technology provides the architecture to combine state-of-the-art converters to dramatically increase the speed. The Linearity Error Compensation (LinComp) technology provides dramatic improvements in dynamic range, whichenables very accurate conversion at high IF or RF frequencies.  By eliminating stages of RF downconversion or upconversion, these technologies greatly accelerate the progress toward direct digitization or synthesis of wideband data directly at the antennaelement.  The breakthrough in converter performance afforded by the AFB and LinComp technologies will be demonstrated by developing fully-functioning prototypes combining these technologies.An open architecture prototype system will be developed provide a versatile platform to rapidly develop, test, and integrate the very latest converters using these technologies;  target specifications include: 1) 12-bit ADC with 1.6 GHz sample rate (withdirect sampling up to 800 MHz IF or RF); 2) 14-bit ADC with 800 MHz sample rate (with direct sampling up to 400 MHz IF/RF); 3) 16-bit ADC with 400 MHz sample rate (with direct sampling up to 200 MHz IF/RF); and 4) 14-bit DAC with 2 GHz sample rate (withdirect digital synthesis up to 1 GHz IF/RF)In addition, a very compact prototype AFB ADC system will  be developed for demonstration in the Navy Theater Wide (NTW) digital beam former (DBF) array or other system to test the AFB and LinComp technologies in an operationally relevant environment; thissystem will be designed to provide beyond state-of-the-art, extremely high speed and high resolution analog-to-digital conversion in a very compact package.Very importantly, the AFB and LinComp technologies have been specifically designed to avoid obsolescence because they can both be easily upgraded as new individual converters become available.  This Phase II project is based upon two successful SBIR PhaseI projects demonstrating the technical efficacy of these technologies in working lab breadboards.  Numerous commercial and government entities have pledged a total of $490,000 of financial support for matching funds for this project;  these entities willalso provide technical support to help develop the technologies and a strong customer base for the commercialization in Phase III.The AFB and LinComp technologies overcome the critical analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion bottleneck whichlimits performance of state-of-the-art radio frequency transceiver systems.  Significant applications include enhancement of advanced radar systems, wideband universal RF transceivers, wideband Electronic Warfare transceivers, multi-beam adaptive digitalbeamforming array transceivers, linearization of full RF receive or transmit chains, smart radios for wireless communications (cellular and satellite), wide bandwidth modems, high performance special test equipment, software radios, and anti-Jam GPSReceivers.  The AFB and LinComp technologies greatly accelerate the progress toward direct digitization or synthesis of wideband data directly at the antenna element.",

Samples will be collected from VaxGen's current Phase III U.S. AIDS vaccine clinical trials.  Amino acid sequences will be analyzed using new software that maps sequence variation onto the 3D crystal structure of gp120 to define substitutions that may alter the antigenic profile.  This study will provide a database of virus sequences currently circulating throughout North America, with reference to approximate time of infection, geographic distribution, and the nature of source material.  These data will aid in incorporating new antigens to improve current HIV vaccine efficacy against variants of subtype B by guiding selection of the most appropriate envelope antigens for next generation HIV vaccines.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a fully functioning prototype software tool that will allow educators, interpreters,  and linguists skilled in American Sign Language (ASL), but not in computer 3-D animation, to create fully grammatical synthesized ASL.  This technology will provide language access for Deaf individuals to Internet web pages and CD-ROM based media.  This project builds upon the P.I.'s commercial Sign Smith products, which were developed, in part, under an earlier NSF SBIR grant.  The current technology allows users to generate unique sentences composed of signs that are in citation, or non-inflected form and to add facial expressions.  The resulting sign and sentence structure approximates English grammar and therefore represents a transliteration, also known as Signed English.  Although Signed English does provide some access to digital media, the absence of many elements of ASL grammar limits the use of the technology by the larger segment of the Deaf population who require grammatical ASL for access.  These tools will enable the user to dynamically compose and inflect ASL signs from parameterized components using several spatial frames of reference.  These sign types include pronouns, indicating and locative verbs, and classifier predicates.\n\nThe final commercial product will be a new integrated tool within the P.I.'s commercial Sign Smith Studio Authoring Tool.  This tool will allow educators and multimedia developers to create engaging, grammatically correct, ASL animations for language access to digital information on Web Pages and in CD-ROM titles.  The software interface not only allows authors to spatially inflect signs, but also it can be used to create signs as well.  This capability opens opportunities for quickly building libraries of technical and scientific terms to be used in educational and scientific curricula.  It also affords the potential to create libraries of foreign sign languages, therefore making it possible for the product to enter international markets.  Content can be viewed using a proprietary licensed software Player.  This product will increase access of Deaf and Hard of Hearing children and adults to digitally based information and promote inclusive education and employment approaches which accords with the language and intent of the New Freedom Initiative, recent amendments to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and Section 255 of the Telecommunications Act.

The proposed Phase II effort will design, develop and demonstrate a propellant charge and smart ignition system capable of creating a range of expulsion velocities relative to the penetrating munition as required to achieve zero velocity in the voidspace.  Much of the experimental work will be performed at mid (40 percent) scale; however, the Phase II effort will result in the design and test of the critical components for a full-scale expulsion system.

We demonstrated how a situational scenario can be described using ontologieswritten in DAML and how the relations relevant to a set of user defined goals can be inferred, including fusion of uncertain, multi-source information. In Phase II we will develop an automated SAW Assistant (SAWA) that facilitates every step in our formalmethodology including ontology and model generation, rule construction, Level 1 event management, situational state management, derivation of relations by reasoning agents, and interaction with the user through a graphical interface.  We will demonstratethe effectiveness of the system on multiple scenarios defined in the context of the DAML Experiment (focusing on Joint Vision 2020 strategic objectives).

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In a new therapeutic approach for delayed gastric emptying and gastroparesis, Virginia Technologies, Inc. (VTI) proposes: (1) to develop a 4-channel implantable gastric pacemaker, using pulse train electrical signals and capacitive coupling for patient safety and energy efficiency; (2) to develop a multi-channel pacing lead, optimized for gastric applications; (3) to develop a transcutaneous programmer and wand, enabling healthcare providers to customize and optimize pacing parameters to the needs of each patient; and (4) to test this system in animal models, studying safety and efficacy. The long-term goal of this research is to develop an implantable device for the superior treatment of motility disorders associated with gastroparesis in humans. Electrical stimulation of the gastrointestinal organs represents a promising new treatment for gastric motility disorders. These organs have natural pacemakers that generate myoelectrical activity, regulating contractions and motility. Myoelectrical abnormalities can disturb muscular activity, impairing contraction and leading to delay or failure of gastric emptying. In gastroparesis, impaired gastric emptying can lead to nausea, vomiting, premature satiety, abdominal pain, abdominal bloating, weight loss, bacterial overgrowth, and obstruction, as well as difficulties in managing blood glucose levels in diabetics. Traditional therapies for gastroparesis including, prokinetic medications, tube feeding via jejunostomy and total parenteral nutrition (TPN), have various limitations. A number of patients are refractory to the available medications, which also pose the risk of side effects and medicinal interactions. Jejunostomy and TPN offer nutritional support and address the symptoms of gastroparesis, but pose quality-of-life issues and do not correct the underlying disorder. Single-point, low-energy electrical stimulation, such as that provided by Medtronic's Enterra TM Therapy, also generally treats symptoms of nausea and vomiting, rather than the underlying disorder. In a new treatment option for motility disorders, the multi-channel phased gastric pacemaker uses electrical pacing to mimic the natural propagation of gastric slow waves. It generates peristaltic electrical waves that progress from the proximal to the distal stomach, seeking to entrain gastric slow waves, normalize gastric myoelectrical dysrhythmias, and normalize gastric emptying. Recent studies have shown that multi-channel pacing entrains gastric slow waves more effectively than prior single-channel high-energy approaches, and that a multi-channel design requires less energy, making it more appropriate for a long-term human-implantable therapeutic device.",

New data concerning interactions of intracellular proteins, ion concentrations, membrane potential and additional forms of cellular activity are obtained from quantitative measurement of light from exogenous and endogenous optical probes. The accuracy of these measurements relies heavily on well calibrated and characterized microscope light detection systems.   \n  \nThis proposal describes the commercial development of three instruments to benefit quantitative microscopy. The first instrument, Benchmark TM, is a versatile standard for quantitative light microscopy. A reliable and easily used high precision standard is not commercially available and would greatly facilitate reproducible measurements. Technologies currently used as light standards for microscopy present some practical difficulties. The calibrated light output of these devices is affected by illuminator lamp noise and aging. The light output of the electronic standard described in this proposal is independent of the microscope's illuminator output. Benchmark TM provides repeatable fiat-field illumination at multiple user selectable wavelengths and illumination levels from a single aperture. The second instrument, ilium TM can be used to monitor and record the intensity level of the microscope's illuminator. The third instrument, RatioLite TM, will provide dual wavelength emission for ratiometric recording of fluorescent dyes. These instruments are uniquely versatile, having operating modes unavailable in any competing product.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects (FAS/FAE) are a series of irreversible birth defects that persist throughout the life span of the individual. Because of developmental delays and deficits in abstract thinking, children with these disorders can miss the connection between cause and effect, which often results in risky behaviors and dangerous encounters with their environment. Phase II proposes to develop a virtual reality Safety Skills Training Program to help children with these special learning needs better understand and practice correct safety actions. It will use a series of virtual situations that model hazardous real-life situations. All four milestones in Phase I were met. These included: (1) establishing the program design for the special learning requirements of children with FAS/FAE, (2) developing a virtual reality program, worlds, and characters to teach home fire safety actions, customized for these special learning needs, (3) demonstrating the playability of the program on a home PC to establish commercial viability, and (4) testing the program with children with this disorder. Efficacy of the program was tested using a multiple baseline, multiple probe design, with five children who had been diagnosed with fetal alcohol related disorders. The results indicated that all the children reached 100% accuracy in identifying fire safety components, defined as doing the correct safety steps in the virtual world, and that eighty percent of these children were able to perform all actions correctly in both generalization and follow-up probes in the real world following virtual training. Phase II will extend the learning concepts developed in Phase I to a final Safety Skills Training Program product to be delivered for game play on a home PC. It will include safety modules, an integrated safety game, and support tools to allow a child to practice correct safety actions in controlled virtual worlds and to help the child generalize these actions to the real world. Program efficacy will be measured with thirty children ages four to ten years old with fetal alcohol related disorders. Phase II will utilize a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to detect differences between groups trained on different selected safety skills.",

        "abstract": "Distributed Mission Training (DMT) provides training in a simulated full-mission environment. Due to technology limitations, analyses are critical to determine what can be trained and to what level it can be trained. To meet this critical need, VSATproposes a new process, Distributed Mission Training Requirements Analysis (DMTRA), supported by an interactive Mission Training Analysis Database (MTAD). The process will connect mission requirements through a trail of mission essential competencies insupport of the Air Combat Command Ready Aircrew Program, to the performance of specific simulated subsystems. Results will be in forms understood at all decision-making levels. The process will include DMT entity interactions and the complex interactiveenvironment. In Phase I, VSAT developed samples of the process and database that demonstrated their feasibility. In Phase II, VSAT proposes to perform research and analysis to develop and integrate all aspects of the process, creating a fully functionalMTAD prototype. VSAT proposes to demonstrate the process and MTAD by performing a comprehensive analysis of AFRL/HEA training missions and a distributed exercise with a remote facility.",

Optical imaging in the near-infrared spectrum offers the possibility to employ fluorescently tagged reporter probes to obtain specific molecular information about a particular disease state. VisEn Medical, Inc. is pioneering the development of a novel optical molecular imaging technology platform that enables imaging of molecular activity in-vivo. This proprietary technology platform is based on near-infrared activatible optical probes that become activated only when they come in contact with the specific enzymes that they are designed to target. VisEn is currently developing a Cathepsin B enzyme-imaging probe for early clinical cancer detection. We have chosen to target the enzyme Cathepsin B as it is known to be associated with several different types of cancer, including colon and ovarian cancer, as well as other diseases such as arthritis and cardiovascular disease. The overall goal of this SBIR grant proposal is to test and characterize the different near infrared fluorochrome probes developed during Phase I of this project in different in-vivo disease models in order to select a candidate for clinical trials. The Specific Aims of this Phase II proposal are summarized below.  \n  \n1. Test at least three different Cathepsin B probes in animal tumor models for their ability to detect cancer.  \n2. Evaluate the probes for their ability to detect different types of tumors, specifically colorectal and ovarian tumors.  \n3. Determine key preclinical Cathepsin B probe properties, including the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and toxicity of the probes.  \n4. Conduct preliminary formulation and stability studies.",

In Phase I, we have demonstrated the value of converting black box learners into open(human-understandable) learners in the form of decision trees and the rule sets that are derived from them.  While classification accuracy has always been of utmost importance, speed has become an increasingly important issue with the proliferation ofterabyte- and even petabyte-sized digital image databases.  Theory refinement has the advantages of both rule-based expert systems and inductive learning, and takes advantage of uniquely human perception in extracting features from imagery.  Mostimportantly, it makes feature extraction models more portable and reduces expert user time and effort in porting models to new and different problem domains.  Geospatial information technology is the cornerstone that supports the United States defense andintelligence mission to maintain information superiority over enemy forces.  The connectionist theory refinement system proposed here advances VLS' award winning  Feature Analystr software by increasing the speed, accuracy, and portability of AFE models.The convergence between GIS software technology and the high-resolution commercial satellite imagery market provides substantial opportunities for the Feature Analyst technology in the following market spaces:1.

The proposed Phase-II research will developpractical tools to visually and quantitatively evaluate helmet fit on realistic digital headforms. These tools will facilitate design of head mounted equipment with optimal CPPC.  VSI made significant advances to overcome technical hurdles and demonstratekey concepts during Phase-I program.  This proposal presents a comprehensive Phase II research program to develop these concepts into practical working models for evaluating HGU-56/P and other military and commercial helmet systems.  This research willsignificantly enhance the Army's capability to evaluate existing helmets and design new helmets using a representative sample population or a boundary figure subset of digital headforms. The technology developed under this program will compliment existingcomputer simulation work and significantly reduce time and cost associated with fitting, customization, and modification of helmet systems.  These tools will not only assist in evaluating and improving current helmet systems, but also will greatly enhancethe ability of the Army to design future personal protective equipment.  Commercialization potential for the technology developed under this program is significant, as numerous industrial applications would benefit from the ability to cost effectivelydesign and conduct simulated testing of new protective equipment in order to optimize comfort, safety and reliability at a minimal cost.

        "abstract": "70465B02-II     By definition, wind shear creates substantially higher winds at greater heights; therefore in many parts of the U.S., wind sites that are marginal at lower heights could become viable at greater heights.  The additional reliability of these winds increases turbine utilization, enabling more economical energy production.  However, the high cost of construction, shipment, and installation of large and heavy towers to support these turbines increases the cost of energy and marginalizes the economics.  Presently, 1.5 MW turbines are rarely taller than 80 m because of this limitation, and many sites are left undeveloped.  This project will develop a lightweight, space frame tower made of carbon that will be assembled at the job site to enable easy tilt-up, thereby eliminating the need for an expensive crane and keeping transportation costs low.  Phase I used computerized optimization routines to analyze over 70 geometries for a 1.5 MW tower at heights from 63 to 100 m.  A lightweight, composite tower configuration was identified that not only would have lower manufacturing costs, but also would be able to withstand wind turbine loads and tilt-up stresses at greater heights.  Phase II will assemble space frames from composite tube segments.  A detailed design will focus on the interface between the metal and the composite tubing. Strength and fatigue testing will be conducted to verify the integrity of the joints and the composite tubes.  Upon completion, a 1.5 MW turbine using a space frame tower will be erected.

The instrument will detect Supercooled Cloud Drops (5-50 microns diameter), SupercooledLiquid Droplets, SLD, (50-500 microns diameter), and raindrops (>500 microns diameter).  The instrument will be compact (fit in 1 ft3), lightweight, and cost effective. Also, with WaveBand's previously developed beam-steering antennas, the new instrumentwill be capable of imaging runways, and remotely detect wires and other targets.  In nonpolarized operation mode it also will deliver brightness temperature.The new instrument will measure four Stokes parameters at two millimeter-wave frequencies (94 GHz and 35 GHz).  The key element of the instrument, its front-end variable phase retarder, will be also compatible with most of the existing or futureradiometers and radars.  It can be readily integrated with WaveBand's MMW imaging system providing polarization information that will greatly enhance target discrimination and clutter rejection capability.  The development will benefit the US Armyhelicopter upgrade programs such as: BLACKHAWK, COMMANCHE and APACHE as well as potential applications in civilian aviation and atmospheric science.",

        "abstract": "WaveBand will develop an advanced facial expression analysis solution implemented as a real-time system to successfully measure a student's emotional state with the use of low-cost web cameras. The system uses that information to modulate the reactions ofan intelligent tutoring system. The proposed solution goes beyond the state-of-the art by interpreting facial motion data obtained from a facial feature tracker in the context of psychological and educational content. This context-based approach offersmajor advantages over the passive interpretation of facial communication cues as it eliminates invalid combinations at an early stage and thereby increases recognition accuracy. Furthermore, it naturally lends itself to the interpretation of characteristictrainee behavior, such as attention, mental effort, hesitation or confusion, and fatigue, as they relate to the progress of a learning session in the computer-based training system.The system called, AffectCam, analyzes the students' emotional and attentive state in the context of a multi-modal dialogue model in which the learner is treated as part of a collaborative process and non-verbal cuesare interpreted in relation to theevents of the learning session itself. This active approach offers critical advantages over existing Intelligent Tutoring Systems, as it mimics the process of face-to-face human interaction.",

WaveBand's solution overcomes inherent compact rangelimitations caused by the fact that the far-field antenna requirements cannot be satisfied.The application of these innovations will enable:- 10 MHz angle of arrival update rate for the composite signal synchronized with the seeker waveform.- GHz instantaneous bandwidth.- +/- 1.5 deg. Accuracy of the beam pointing.- Dynamically adjustable beamwidth comparable with the seeker under the test (SUT).- Multi mode operation by combining IR and SAL signals with MMW on SUT.Phase II will demonstrate the functionality of the proposed compact simulator and its integration with 5-axes Flight Control Simulator and MMW signal generator.The compact range based on ESM will benefit MMW radar development for automotive, aviation, security, railroads and marine markets as a compact and affordable test bed.",

A low-cost, truly affordable sensor becomes possible due to the proposed novel all-around scanning MMW antenna with no moving RF parts and a PC-based radar signal processor (RSP).  Phase Ihas established the feasibility of the MMW perimeter security monitor (MPSM) that will provide:- All weather, day/night, perimeter monitoring that features high number (up to 60) full scans per second.- 360\u00c2\u00bf field of view (FOV).- High resolution enabling boat (on the water) or human (on the pier) detection.- Motion and intelligent object discrimination for autonomous operation.- Automatic alarm and video/FLTR camera queuing due to automatic target detection and tracking.- Ease of installation and maintenance due to the combined (transceiver + antenna) front end and low-frequency cable connector to the RSP.Phase II work will demonstrate fully functioning MSPM in both seaside and port target detection in clutter. User's site testing is planned along with the platform integration. The proposed MPSM extends its usefulness to civilian applications as an intrusion warning system to protect national assets and limited access areas and as a fire detection system for national parks, nature preserves and urban/wildland interface.

        "abstract": "The commercial development and initial deployments of the EM-APEX, a new instrument that is capable of measuring repeated profiles of ocean velocity, temperature, and salinity during hurricanes and severe storms, is proposed.  Our understanding of oceanand atmosphere dynamics during severe storms is handicapped, in part, by a lack of instruments and deployment techniques suitable for this severe environment.  The EM-APEX represents a union of two mature technologies.  The vertical variations ofhorizontal velocity of seawater is determined by the measurement of electric currents induced in seawater as the instrument moves through the earth's magnetic field.  These observations of the horizontal electric field (HEF) in the ocean have beensuccessfully used in a wide variety of situations, including high wind and sea conditions.  We propose to integrate this proven sensor EM technology with a mature autonomous ocean profiling instrument, the APEX (Autonomous Profiling Explorer), of whichover 2000 units have been built and deployed.  APEX is certified by US DOD for deployment from C130 aircraft, and has been deployed by this method in the Atlantic Ocean, Red Sea, Japan, Mediterranean, and South China Seas.The new velocity and water property profiling floats will be deployed in 2004 hurricanes chosen by the ONR CBLAST program.  They will be programmed to continuously profile from their parking depth, say 200 m to the surface.  Each profile will require abouthalf an hour to traverse 200 m, more if a deeper parking depth is chosen.  The floats will be deployed in a 2004 hurricane along with other CBLAST floats and assets. Improved understanding of storm dynamics will benefit storm forecasters, naval and commercial ship operations, coastal communities and the insurance and offshore petroleum industry.  This work will assure that this technology is available to the Navy andworldwide users.  There is the expectation that many of these velocity profiling floats will be used in the international ARGO float program.  The results should be improved weather prediction, storm detection, SML evolution, and basic research.",

The CHG is confined in a polyethylene glycol matrix uniformly dispersed in the elastomer, and it is released in sustained fashion over periods up to 4 weeks. This catheter material has been shown to be effective in vitro against organisms commonly associated with UTI. The choice of CHG as the antiseptic agent is based on its broad spectrum of activity, comparatively low toxicity, and low incidence of the development of bacterial resistance. In Phase II, methods for fabricating the catheters will be refined, and the effectiveness of the catheter material to inhibit or kill bacteria as a function of usage time evaluated. Toxicity studies required to fulfill the requirements of ISO 10993-18, a standard for medical device materials, will be conducted; and the shelf life of the catheters will be determined.

This capability makes it possible to consider use of the system beyond the relatively static and high-contrast training environment to use of a mobile/wearable system in natural environments. Thus the system could be of great value for enhancing function in the crucial area of Orientation and Mobility (O&M). This Phase II proposal is to build the portable TVSS and continue development and testing on two fronts. We will extend the work to adults while expanding upon the work already done with children. The primary emphasis for this phase will be on examining the utility of the TVSS for O&M training. Specific Aims include: (1)- to develop and test a portable TVSS for spatial orientation and mobility with blind adults and children.

The shear mode of PMN-PT crystals will be investigated to achieve a vector sensor with a noise floor which is 6 dB lower than what has been achieved using the flexural mode of the crystal.  In addition, existing array telemetryelectronics will be modified to create a four channel data acquisition and communications module for processing the vector's output signals and converting them to the TAIPT communication protocol. A low noise vector sensor with build in arraycommunications can be rapidly integrated into existing Naval towed array applications.  A vector sensor will provide directional information on target noise sources unlike existing omin-directional hydrophones.  The vector sensor could also be used in hullmounted and sono--buoy applications as well.  In addition to Naval applications the vector sensor could be used for Homeland Security applications, specifically, harbor and port defense.  An array of vector sensors could be placed at choke points toidentify potentially hostile crafts.  Lastly, the vector sensor could be used to aid in Oil and Gas exploration.  The sensors directional qualities could be used to more precisely pinpoint the location of potential drilling sites.",

        "abstract": "As modern electronic systems increase in complexity, it becomes more necessary to perform accurate health monitoring to ensure proper performance.  Traditionally, crews of maintainers and technical experts have been sufficient to analyze faults throughobservation and electrical troubleshooting.  However, this approach is unsuitable for modern avionics, in which thousands of electrical connections may exist between hundreds of avionic subsystems.  As a result, significant effort has been expended todevelop automatic reasoning systems capable of sensing state parameters and making accurate decisions concerning the condition of the system.     To reduce the complexity and cost associated with avionic system maintenance, Williams-Pyro proposes to continue development of its novel prognostics/diagnostics tool based on artificial neural network (ANN) technology.  WPI has proven theeffectiveness of this concept within the Phase I effort and intends to further improve the Smart Embedded Avionic Monitoring System (SEAMS) to ensure operational suitability.  Developed in conjunction with the University of Texas at Arlington, the SEAMSalgorithm combines the diagnostic capabilities of three different neural networks to produce a health monitoring analysis more accurate than any taken separately. The SEAMS system will provide an embedded means of detecting faults within avionic circuitry.  If successful, this system will drastically reduce the cost associated with avionic maintenance - reducing the number of man-hours needed as well as the amountof test equipment.  The initial target market for our Smart Embedded Avionic Monitoring System (SEAMS) is the U.S. Marine Corp's AH-1 Super Cobra Helicopter, the attack version of the UH-1",

To accomplish both tasks, Williams-Pyro, Inc. proposes to develop the Smart Environmental Monitoring System (SEMS). This system comprises both an advanced fire detection system and the networking capability necessary to provide real-time data to emergency personnel. This device will utilize a multi-sensor suite to measure optical radiation, temperature, gases, and smoke produced by a fire. These sensors send their results to an embedded microcontroller that determines the presence of flame through use of an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm. The ANN sends its response to a network switch that connects it to the building's network. From there, the response can be viewed on a display system, called the fire console, located outside the building or within its common entrance. Along with the location of the fire, the SEMS will show the direction of the fire, the building's temperature, and the presence of harmful gases.",

IEEE 802.11 WiFi technology is the state-of-the-art development in protocols. It is a de facto standard, as well as a specification forsmall-form factor (low-cost radio links between various devices). It delivers opportunities for rapid, ad-hoc connections and the possibility of automatic, unconscious connections between Tags and Tag Readers. Optimization of the parameters of the networkwill be addressed.  This optimization will allow passive methods to be considered for implementation.This proposal presents techniques for properly implementing WCM as part of a larger, comprehensive, continuous maintenance strategy.  Reducing total ownership cost by reducing shipboard workload will be the focus of this proposed research, though thetechniques developed do generalize to the control of a large class of general DE systems.

Second, our improved system will undergo qualification testing.  Once qualified, our system will undergo field-testing with the support of NAVSEA, fleet representatives, and shipbuilders.  This lengthy step willensure that WCM Tag performs as designed by providing low-cost, reliable asset tracking without alerting the enemy to a ship's position.

The SPDR will process the data using CBM and RUL software and use wireless or wired means to forward thehealth findings to a central monitoring station that will display the health status of every machinery space.

A variety of commercially available membrane-based cell culture devices are available for the culture of mammalian ceils that have been adapted to suspension culture. A growing number of industrially important cells, however, are anchorage-dependent. Existing membrane-based devices lack the proper materials for adherent cell attachment and have sub-optimal surface areas. The membrane based roller bottle (MBRB) is a practical, cost effective culture device designed to meet this need and improve culture productivity. The MBRB combines the simplicity of the traditional roller bottle with membrane-based attributes. In the proposed Phase II studies, the MBRB will be optimized for the production of anchorage-dependent cells, cell-secreted products, and cellular transduction. Specific aims include a thorough mechanical design investigation followed by on-site and off-site application testing. The commercialization of a membrane-based family of research and clinical scale roller bottle devices is expected to lead to a more efficient use of biotechnology resources. At the completion of Phase II, the MBRB will be targeted to manufacturers of small and mid-scale culture devices for the production of cells or cell products for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.",

The rocket exhaust and its impingement on the ground, from either a solid or liquid motor, and the hot gases that escape a launchcanister produce robust repeatable observables that can be used for missile detection and typing. The fluid mechanical, chemical, and radiative transport analyses employ approximate solutions producing a very rapid yet accurate solution. Future customizedvariants of the code would run in real time allowing them to be incorporated into operational systems. The apparent signature for a remote observer employs a transmission library based on MODTRAN calculations or is user supplied. In Phase I the accuracy ofvarious components of the proposed code were demonstrated using comparisons to SPF and SPURC results. The Missile Launch Signature Code will interface with PARCS and SPURC to provide coupled optical and electromagnetic observables.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a novel prototype optoelectronic sensing system for the high-speed identification and sorting of metals, particularly aluminum alloys. The goal is to develop the capability to sort aluminum into its exact alloy designations. The technology is expected to sort materials in less than 50-milliseconds per item automatically without operator intervention while the scrap is in motion on a high-speed conveyor belt. The scrap recycling industry reports that more than 30 billion pounds of nonferrous metals are produced each year in the U.S. alone. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) reports that more than 10 billion pounds of these nonferrous metals are discarded each year in landfills, because recycling is either technically or economically impractical. Existing methods of sortation that employ visual examination and hand sortation, or alternatively employ heavy media separation, cannot sort aluminum by alloy type. Refining is accomplished in smelting facilities that are expensive to build and often polluting. Using advanced spectrographic detection techniques, including computer analysis; the proposed technology will improve alloy identification accuracy and automatically sort aluminum metal alloys at speeds never before attainable. \n     The commercial impact of this project will be increased scrap utilization, increased scrap value, reduced pressure on non-renewable resources, and reduced environmental pollution. The potential worldwide market exceeds $2 billion annually.",

        "abstract": "XCom Wireless is a developer of RF MEMS relays, high-performance components that have been identified as a critical technology for the next generation of defense and commercial electronics.  XCom RF MEMS-enabled circuits can serve as direct alternatives tosolid-state devices so communications and radar equipment manufacturers can easily upgrade, saving weight, space, power, and on system cost.  The goal of the proposed program is to increase subsystem integration to enable smaller, higher performancesolutions while retaining the flexibility of hybrid system design and assembly.  In the Phase I effort of this program, designs for integrated passives and tunable filter elements were designed and manufactured.  The test results from these passives andfilter elements will be correlated to the filter design models for improved accuracy in Phase II redesign of electronically tunable filters.   The program will result in the iterative design, test, and manufacture of bandpass and bandstop filters that aretunable over the 30 MHz to 1,000 MHz frequency range.  XCom Wireless will employ low loss, low cost, hybrid integrated RF MEMS devices to enable the design of compact, high-performance electronically-reconfigurable filters.  The XCom design strategy ofstacked assembly of RF MEMS with integrated passive components promises both low-cost and rapid manufacturing potential for specialized, high-performance defense applications from VHF to the mm-wave regime.This Phase II effort benefits the Department ofDefense in that it develops a highly adaptable, high-performance, low-cost radio filter concept into a prototype subsystem.  The concept of a MEMS-based reconfigurable filter has generated interest from government agencies as well as commercial RF systemdevelopers, with few MEMS suppliers able to provide operational components to meet industry challenges.  XCom Wireless has been developing a novel architecture for designing MEMS actuators into hybrid subsystem packages, allowing the flexibility of designand reliability of manufacture needed by critical services.  The leveraging of XCom expertise, commercial opportunity, and ongoing complementary Air Force and NASA programs allows this Phase II effort to further MEMS technologies towards subsystemintegration and field testing.  The benefit to the base station and critical civilian radio industry is significant, in that the markets for high-performance broadband and multi-band RF components and subsystems is large and growing at 35% yearly.  Theneed for agile software is already being addressed heavily by commercial industries, but few companies are independently supporting the development of agile hardware.  The test and instrumentation community, the aerospace communications and radarcommunity, and defense wireless system developers have been identified as the first adopters of agile RF MEMS technologies, with relevant MEMS-enabled component and subsystem sales expected to grow to over $200 million in 2006.  Consumer markets for RFMEMS include fixed broadband equipment, WLAN hardware, and civilian handsets, and are projected to reach $1.5 billion in 2006.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Xcyte Therapies has developed a process (\"Xcellerate\") for the ex vivo activation and expansion of T cells using magnetic beads coated with antibodies to CD3 and CD28. Xcellerated T Cells from patients with CLL demonstrate an enhanced T cell repertoire, and the ability to induce the apoptosis of autologous tumor cells. Xcyte Therapies now plans to test this process as a therapy for patients with CLL. A dose escalation trial will be performed.  \nThe Specific Aims of this proposal are to:  \n1.  Optimize large-scale bioreactor production of Xcellerated T Cells for CLL patients. Xcyte has developed a large-scale production process that will be able to achieve the cell doses required for the first two patient cohorts in the proposed clinical trial. Xcyte is now developing a bioreactor process to achieve the higher cell yields, which will be required to treat the third cohort of patients in the clinical trial. Xcyte will optimize and validate this process specifically for CLL.  \n2.  Determine the safety & feasibility of infusinq Xcellerated T Cells in CLL patients in a dose escalation trial. Each patient will receive a single dose of Xcellerated T Cells. The cell dose will be escalated in cohorts of three patients each to determine the maximum tolerated dose (up to a maximum of 1 x 1011). The Xcellerated T Cell doses for each cohort will be: 1 x 1010, 3 x 1010, and 1 x 1011. Patients will be monitored carefully for toxicity. We will assess the influence of patient disease and prior treatment factors on final product characteristics.  \n3.  Characterize immune reconstitution in patients treated with Xcellerated T Cells. We will assess changes in lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry, immunoglobulin levels, and T cell repertoire by spectratyping.  \n4.  Assess anti-tumor activity in CLL patients treated with Xcellerated T Cells. Patients will be monitored for clinical responses, changes in lymph node area, leukemic cell counts, expression of immunologic effector molecules on B cells, plasma cytokine levels, and anti-tumor T cell reactivity by ELISPOT.  \nXcyte Therapies has designed the clinical trial in collaboration with Dr. Thomas Kipps from the University of California, San Diego. He will serve as the principal clinical investigator for the trial.  \nIf the Xcellerate therapy can be determined to be safe, to improve the immune repertoire of patients, and to demonstrate evidence of anti-tumor activity, Xcyte will conduct subsequent trials to demonstrate its clinical benefit in CLL patients. Subsequent trials will also examine immune reconstitution following therapy with agents such as fludarabine and Campath",

Current methods for oral delivery of macromolecular and other drugs poorly absorbed by the intestine do not provide adequate oral bio-availability. Thus, new intestinal pathways to transport larger quantities of compound must be identified. Unfortunately, current methods of pathway identification are inadequate. XenoPort will address this problem by developing a new method for displaying synthetic molecules on phage particles to fully exploit the exquisite sensitivity and versatility of the phage for display of molecular libraries. These libraries will be used to screen for ligands to receptors directing the most active transcytosis pathways through the intestinal epithelium, enabling development of a commercial-ready technology platform adaptable to a wide variety of compounds in all therapeutic areas. Phase I studies established the fundamental method for constructing, screening and decoding libraries of synthetic compounds displayed on phage. Phase II will develop and evaluate a model peptide library of extraordinarily diverse synthetic compounds for enhanced discovery of novel ligands active in endocytosis and transcytosis.

        "abstract": "When dealing with a standard problem of atmospheric compensation using adaptive-optics, classic analysis shows that phase variance falls sharply with increasing temporal frequency.  This is just a matter of the statistics of turbulence.  However, todaythere are many scenarios where this basic assumption doesn't hold true.  Scenarios with high scintillation, turbulence that doesn't satisfy standard statistics, or systems that contain high frequency jitter, need a system that can generate large amounts ofstroke at high frequency.  New deformable mirrors must be developed that can handle these high current reuqirements without damaging the ceramic actuators used in today's mirrors.  In addition, the need to make smaller optical systems while retaining thesame large number of degrees of freedom further complicates the issue.   Xinetics proposes to build a new type of deformable mirror that will address both of these issues.  The mirror will utilize new understanding on actuator technology to insure that theactuator can operate to high frequencies at full stroke.  In addition, the mirror will use a new modular mirror technology that permits much more compact and efficient mirror designs and robotic technology to aid in the assembly process",

A practical and convenient solution to this problem is proposed, in which the position and orientation of the anti-scatter grid is determined by a computer.

The system will consist of a set of tightly integrated syntactic and semantics-driven data extraction technologies that are managed from a graphical user interface.  The goal will be to retrieve information that was created for human understandability, and work with it to create knowledge that can support automated decision-making and transactions. The system will empower users, who are knowledgeable about their application domains but are not necessarily trained as computing technologists, to rapidly structure data into knowledge.  The Phase II implementation effort will build upon the results from the Phase I feasibility study to produce a fully functional system.\n\nPhase III will make the system commercially available to clients with diverse business interests including content aggregation, e-procurement, ERP, and supply chain management vendors.",

All candidate positive displacement expanders for steam engines requiretribology technology that can provide reasonable friction and wear while maintaining contact and/or close running clearances of the moving parts in a high temperature and pressure stress environment. Graphite materials and material combinations are a classof materials that have good potential for this application. The identification, evaluation, and application to graphite-based tribological systems to the design of steam expanders will be the primary focus of this work. The general approach will be tofirst implement specialized engine component tribological test apparatus. A full scale steam expander machine, of approximately 1 kW power capacity, will then be designed and tested. This approach is justified based on the complex materials, mechanical,stress, and thermal conditions encountered in steam expanders and the difficulty replicating all conditions in a more controlled manner in standard test instruments. Emphasis will be on expander mechanical configurations that have the potential to minimizethe wear and friction conditions imposed on the tribological elements of the design, such as may be available with the scroll type expander design. Steam conditions to 1000 pisg will be investigated.",

The merit of the CKEM body-flexure/PZT control, in its design simplicity, lower weight and drag and withfeasible power required, has been confirmed by ZONA's detailed computational software studies.  In Phase II, intensive aerothermodynamic analysis will be conducted for a viable heat-shield design to ascertain thermal protection of the PZT operation duringthe hypervelocity flight.  Temperature, heat rate sensitivity analysis will be conducted with various thermal protection system (TPS) approaches including ablation.  Structural integration of the CKEM body/heat-shield/TPS system will be assured usingASTROS* structural optimization subjected to the system strength constraints. 6-D.O.F. autopilot design and trajectory simulation will be carried out for power required and performance evaluations. For concept validation, three wind-off tests includingthermal, static and dynamic tests  on the test models, with imbedded PZT control, which will be fabricated based on the specifications guided by ZONA's R&D studied data.  Deliverables include heat-shield design methodology and the design/analysis softwareZONAIR and a design layout for the CKEM body.  Phase II option is a preparation of the wind-tunnel/sled tests for Phase III tests and demonstration.ZONA envisions that the developed hypersonic aerothermodynamic software ZONAIR and the ASTROS* structuraloptimization system software can be seamlessly integrated into a powerful toolbox, HyAAT, for aerodynamics/aerotheromodynamics/aerothermoelasticity/ASE/sensor- PZT for the design/analysis of current and future hypersonic flight vehicles, including CKEM and those of the FCS.

Therefore, in the phase-I research, an automatic remote runway survey systemusing a small robot with 5 sensors was developed by Zybron, Inc. Prototype demonstration was successfully conducted in Hurlburt, Florida and remarkable achievements were reached. However, the phase I research was only 6 months, not all problems could besolved in that short period. The objective of the phase II is to solve following remaining problems:(1)  Sample the soil and measure the California Bearing Ratio (CBR) up to 3 feet (the depth reached in phase I was only 7 inches) for the whole runway of 4 kilometers within critical time. (2) Measure the obstacles and surface roughness and create a methodfor automatic obstacle avoidance. (3) Measure the runway size and slope. (4) Wireless send  the measured data and images to the remote control center and analyze them to get a correct conclusion that if the site is suitable for use as an assault landingzone, and if so, what class of aircraft can land there.In order to solve above problems, a specially designed robot with proper motion control under GPS navigation and having obstacle avoidance ability will be furnished by the Government to cooperate with our 8 sensors. Detailed software source codes andprotocols, and hardware interfaces of the robot should be supplied. From our side, special cover will be added on the robot to reduce visible, infrared and Radar signatures. Electrical or mechanic dynamic cone penetrometer will be design to measure thesoil load bearing capability up to 3 feet, and at the same time soil samples will be collected. Stereo fusion camera using our unique low light level CCD and uncooled infrared sensors, and laser scanner using invisible laser diode will be designed and usedto detect the obstacles and measure the surface and undersurface conditions (holes, crests, voids, etc.) of the runway. Hardware and software will be developed to let the robot avoid obstacles and holes automatically. The laser scanner will share the laserdiode and the common optical aperture with the laser rangefinder, so the laser rangefinder can measure the runway size by using the pulsed mode. If the robot can find several reference points with known heights, the laser rangefinder also can measure therunway slope. Of course, we also can use an inclinometer to measure the slope quickly. A digital modem using spread spectrum and secret encryption codes will be designed to send the measured and compressed data 30-km away to the computer at the controlcenter to produce the 3-D runway map with size, slope, obstacles, unevenness, CBR, and other parameters by using the AutoCAD and image processing software.The new robot with GPS navigation will be delivered in 6 months, and the innovative remote assault zone survey system satisfying all SOW requirements will be demonstrated at the government selected site.",

It is well known that crystalline LSO is one of the highest performance scintillators in terms of light output and timing. Only one impediment stands in the way of LSO assuming a commanding position in most areas of medical applications: its unacceptably high cost, which is due largely to the very high temperatures necessary to grow the crystals and consequently the very low yield of good crystals (high light output and no afterglow).  \n  \nHaving demonstrated in Phase I that an LSO ceramic can be made and that it has an efficiency and decay time comparable to LSO crystals, while carrying the promise of less afterglow, we wish to embark on a program of optimizing the material. One of the essential aspects is to increase the translucency to at least that of another widely used scintillator, namely GOS ceramic. This goal will be achieved through a control of the microstructure of the ceramic, involving methods, which will promote grain growth.  \n  \nWe believe that the LSO ceramic will be appropriate in PET imaging, which now primarily uses LSO crystals, resulting in greatly reduced cost.

The ONIP is protocol agnostic, interconnecting legacyand future generation networks on a peer-to-peer basis, or through third party industry standard protocol translators, facilitating the interconnection of networks with dissimilar protocols.  The ONIP is data-rate insensitive, accommodating terminals ornetworking devices that operate in ranges from tens of kilobits to tens of gigabits, all within the same box.  On the low-data-rate side, typically wireless or wired networks would connect systems that operate from 16 Kbs to 100 Mbs and are opticallymultiplexed for transfer to another network node.  At the high-data-rate side, free-space or fiber optical trunks or wide band wireless trunks will connect at data rates to 10 Gbs or higher.

        "abstract": "70549     The performance and environmental impact of coal-fueled gasifiers is strongly dependent upon the properties of the feedstock coal.  Real-time knowledge of feedstock parameters, such as heating value and ash and sulfur content, would enable boiler operators to maximize plant efficiency.  Also, real-time data on trace metals, such as mercury, cadmium, arsenic, and lead, not only would provide environmental compliance data, but also would allow boiler operators to reject highly contaminated feedstock prior to its release to the environment.  This project will develop a sensor capable of simultaneously measuring multiple properties of the feedstock entering the coal fueled gasifiers in situ and in real time.  The sensor will measure coal composition and correlate it to the coal\u00c2\u00bfs heating value, sulfur emissions, and other important parameters.  Phase I verified feasibility by accurately measuring the coal\u00c2\u00bfs heating value, sulfur, nitrogen, metals, and ash.  In addition, systems for on-line measurement, for use with powdered coal and also for coal-water slurry, were developed.  In Phase II, a full-scale demonstration at an operating coal-fired power plant will be undertaken.     Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The gasification of coal, our most abundant fossil fuel, has the potential to raise operating efficiencies from 35% to 60% while reducing greenhouse gas emissions, heavy metal pollution, and producing valuable cogeneration products such as hydrogen.  The feedstock monitoring sensor should have commercial applications not only in coal-fed gasifiers, but also in conventional coal-fired power plants.",

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to continue development and application of anovel technology, Dual Immunostaining mediated Subtractive Cloning (DISC).  The technology allows molecular cloning of genes that encode tumor cell surface proteins that are structurally or quantitatively different from those in normal cells.  In Phase I,the feasibility of DISC was demonstrated.  We have shown that rabbit polyclonal antibodies can be used as a complex probe to discover tumor associated cell surface antigens.  Using the tumor cell line HeLa S3 and primary normal human fibroblast cells,polyclonal antibodies against these cell types were purified and effectively labeled using fluorescent dyes.  A highly efficient method was established to identify cell surface antigens or unique epitopes, only expressed in tumor cells.In Phase II, DISC will be further developed and used to clone TAAs for human cancers of the breast, the prostate, and the lung.  Tumor cell lines, tumor tissues, corresponding normal primary cells and normal tissues will be used to clone TAA genes.  In thesame process, rabbit cell lines expressing these TAAs will be obtained.  Rabbit monoclonal antibodies against these TAAs will be generated from these TAA expressing cell lines.  Tumor specificity of the newly discovered TAAs and commercial potential of therabbit monoclonal antibodies will be evaluated by tumor tissue arrays.In this SBIR Phase II, Epitomics will discover and develop new TAAs and rabbit monoclonal antibodies that will enable 1) the rapid identification and characterization of novel tumor antigen targets and 2) commercial development of diagnostic kits.Epitomcis will supply the TAA genes and rabbit monoclonal antibodies to cancer researchers for clinical studies, commercialize them as research reagents and further develop some of the rabbit monoclonal antibodies into products for cancer staging anddiagnosis.",

Recent advances in digital signal processing and sensor technology can, when properly implemented, provide months-in-advance noticeof a bearing failure, expressed in terms of Remaining Useful Life (RUL).  This project is focused on taking these advances to the next level and develop a sensor system capable of the statistical confidence accuracy required for trouble-free life prognosisfor the monitored bearings.  Phase I established the feasibility of using acoustic emission (AE)-based sensors to relate the health of rolling element bearings, and the ability of certain condition indicators to develop RUL prediction algorithms for awireless sensor.  In addition to a primary sensor system, data were also acquired from an engineering-development-style AE system, from traditional accelerometers, and, for the oil-lubricated bearings, from a commercially available ferrographic analysissensor.  Phase II will develop and demonstrate a prototype wireless sensor system.  We will augment the AE sensing strategy with vibration-based indicators.  Phase II work will include land based and shipboard evaluations of a demonstration system thatdisplays a practical ability to assess the condition and RUL of U.S. Navy fire pump bearings.    We anticipate that our wireless sensor system will be an invaluable asset to any commercial industry using rotating machinery.  This work will have direct andimmediate benefits to the Navy in the form of improved capability to determine the RUL of ball bearings in shipboard equipment.  It will also be directly applicable to other military and government installations that utilize machinery with rolling elementbearings.

        "abstract": "Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) has become the Navy's overriding operating philosophy aimed at reducing life-cycle costs while maintaining operational readiness by decreasing maintenance requirements and operating with reduced manpower.  To support theCBM philosophy, the Navy needs to be able to deploy appropriate tools for equipment health assessment, diagnostics, and prognostics.  This requires an integrated framework for the development and evaluation of monitoring, diagnostic, and prognosticapproaches against actual or proposed shipboard system designs.  Phase I successfully demonstrated the concept for a model-based software framework called the Integrated Design Evaluation Architecture for Condition-Based Maintenance (IDEA-CBM), to pullvarious signal processing, diagnostic, and prognostic approaches together and apply the approaches to a partial model of a shipboard system in order to provide an integrated assessment of the system's health.  This approach represents a significant advancein the application of CBM technology.  Development and demonstration of a prototype IDEA-CBM system is proposed in Phase II.  The prototype system will be applied to a complete shipboard system and deployment capabilities demonstrated with an integratedset of signal processing/diagnostic/prognostic approaches to a target Integrated Condition Assessment System (ICAS) through data interface adapters using an open system architecture. The IDEA/CBM framework will facilitate the integration of monitoring,diagnostic and prognostic capabilities to support CBM in a wide range of systems.  The framework could be used by any systems manufacturer or system design or maintenance engineering organization (either commercial or military) to select an optimum set ofcondition assessment tools to match the needs of new or retrofit systems.  The resulting CBM practices can reduce maintenance costs, avoid unplanned system outages, and prevent system failures.  Potential commercial applications are widespread in the powergeneration, petrochemical, food processing, transportation, mining, aerospace, electronics and building industries.",

The integrated diagnostics developed in Phase II will be the basis for a Phase III effort applying the system in clinical trials, final refinement and commercialization. The final system will offer significant advantages to future recipients of implanted blood pumps.

With increasing demands on weapon systems to perform a greater variety ofmissions like those envisioned for JSF and UAVs/UCAVs, asset usage and mission tracking are becoming crucial for life assessment. Concurrent pressure for system reliability and readiness further accentuates this requirement, not only from a deterministic,but a probabilistic basis as dictated for overall fleet management. The capability to reduce raw fleet duty cycle data into information usable to both designers and maintenance planners is essential.  In Phase I, IAC has developed a system for efficientretrieval, analysis, and graphical visualization of data recorded during the aircraft missions. The system is built on the Matlab platform that provides a unique extendible and open architecture for analysis of mission data. In Phase II the software formission data analysis will be further developed to provide a comprehensive extendible framework useful not only for F18 aircrafts but also for other fixed wings as well as other aircrafts of interest to the Navy. This project has a variety of benefits.  Itwill provide not only a unified framework for the analysis of vast amount of data that is currently collected during flight of military aircrafts, but also provide a means for more accurate estimation of remaining useful life of engine components andsubsystems on the basis of real mission data.

Performance characteristics of the most sensitive assay method using aptamers will be directly compared to the same assay method using antibodies.The assays will be run in parallel using identical reagents. The main objective of this Phase II effort is to deliver a set of aptamer-based assays that have highly sensitive and specific detection capabilities, while providing fast results that arerepeatable and are equivalent or better than existing traditional immunoassays.  This program will positively impact the Army's FCS OFW, Special Operations, and Land Warrior soldier with an improved biological detection capability and survivability.Unlike antibodies, aptamers provide a significant cost advantage by eliminating animal host and purification processes, hence are much easier to manufacture by using low cost nucleic acid and PCR reagents.  OmniSite has successfully detected between 10-100anthrax spores using aptamer-based ECL sensor and developed aptamers for foodborne pathogens such as Campylobacter jejuni. OmniSite's aptamer biotechnology can provide inexpensive, fast, easy to use assays for point-of-source (POS) detection instruments (for currently fielded Portal Shield, Joint BioPoint Detection System (JBPDS) or individual chemical/biological (CB) POSsensor for OFW).  Early detection of anthrax spores and SEB is vital for protection of American troops thru improving defensive response time, reducing exposure time to detected toxins to a minimum, and reducing infection rates.OmniSite is confident that these objectives will be achieved.  Raytheon's Advanced Programs Manager has reviewed OmniSite's design objectives and expressed very strong interest in OmniSite's aptamer-based assays for biological detection, along with furtherexpansion of the aptamer technology to chemical detection applications to provide a full CBW sensor suite in one package for the individual soldier.  Because of this huge potential, Raytheon will assist OmniSite in this point detection sensor developmentand proposal assay development for applicability to other system activities, such as FCS, Land Warrior, Special Operations, and OFW to insure successful crossover to Phase III implementation within the Department of Defense and for commercial applicationssuch as homeland defense.",

        "abstract": "The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) requires the capability to provide cryogenic cooling for infrared sensing, cryogen management, electronics cooling, and superconductivity for long term (over five year) space missions.  Multistage cryocoolers have thepotential to reduce the number of coolers needed on a spacecraft and, and therefore, reduce overall system mass and power consumption, and improve reliability.  In Phase II, we propose to continue developing a Multi-Temperature Load Cooler (MTLC) that haspotential to be much more compact, lightweight, and efficient than other types of multistage coolers, especially for applications that require cooling at low temperatures (less than about 35K).  Our cooler will provide stable cooling for variouselectronics or focal plane arrays.  In Phase I, we are demonstrating the operation of a breadboard MTLC.  In Phase II, we will build, test, and deliver to the AFRL an engineering development model (EDM) cooler that simultaneously lifts heat at 35K and 60K.We will develop the mechanical cooler, but we will continue to use breadboard electronics.  In option tasks and Phase III, we will design, build, sell, and license our cooler technology to MDA contractors to include in MDA programs.",

The system would scan very rapidly, produce very high count rates at low electron beam currents, have very good P/B, have 5-20 eV resolution, have the ability to employ \u00c2\u00bfIntelligent Scanning\u00c2\u00bf strategies, and fit on most ports of SEMs.  A key requirement for this system is the development of x-ray collimation optics to allow extension to sufficiently high energy.  Along with the new collimation optics, the mechanism and software for a Parallel Beam Wavelength Dispersive Spectrometer also will be developed.  Phase I developed software to enable the design of the Phase II collimation optics.  A new diffractor, which will be used in Phase II, was investigated and found to produce high count rates for higher x-ray energies.  An interim optic to test the fabrication techniques of Phase II was produced and tested.  Phase II will produce and test the new extended range collimation optics, fabricate a new fast scanning spectrometer, develop \u00c2\u00bfIntelligent Scanning\u00c2\u00bf software and new diffractor technology for the spectrometer, and produce new x-ray detector technology.

It will be a binaural system, with loss and prosthesis characteristics independently specifiable for the left and right channels, and it will provide simple controls so that the user can switch among several loss and prosthesis settings. The eventual goal is to make the simulator available at moderate cost (approximately $700) for the following applications: training audiologists and educators of the deaf; demonstrations in hearing-conservation and public education programs; demonstrations for families of hearing-impaired and deaf persons; demonstrations for prospective hearing aid users; and as a research tool. The work in Phase I developed the core DSP technology for the system and demonstrated the feasibility of a hybrid threshold shift method that uses passive attenuation, masking noise, and automatic gain control to enable accurate simulation of hearing losses as large as 100 dB for a user immersed in a sound field.

During Phase I, lab tests were performed to evaluate the feasibility of piezoelectric sensors fordetecting wire-chafing as well as arc-faults. A wire-chafing simulator was constructed to facilitate the experimental development of the approach. Tests were also performed at NAWC/AD to characterize the performance of the sensor under vibration conditionsexpected onboard an aircraft.  Signal processing methods demonstrate the ability to identify and locate the damage. Phase II will develop a prototype sensor system for evaluation testing by the Navy. Key to the success of  the acousticprognostic/diagnostic system is light weight, cost effective hardware and a viable aircraft integration technique to address the wiring complexity of typical legacy aircraft as well as new wiring architectures such as the Ribbonized Organized Integrated(ROI) wiring on the H-1. The ROI wiring architecture lends itself to embedding a Prognostic and Health Management strategy that will allow the integration of wiring diagnostics with the rest of the diagnostic system to give system level health status ofthe aircraft.  Incorporation of the in-situ wire chafing diagnostic technology into an aircraft health monitoring system will increase the safety and readiness of both military and commercial aircraft fleets.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are approximately 10,000 traumatic spinal cord injuries in the United States each year. The average age of injury is 31 years. The majority (90%) of individuals survive and live near-normal life spans. Cost of treating these injuries is very high and does not lead to complete recovery. Spinal cord injury can result in progressive axonal degeneration, variable amounts of neuronal loss, and functional impairment. Effective therapies have to be designed to not only minimize the loss of tissue due to secondary processes but also to promote axonal growth and functional regeneration. We are developing cell-based delivery of proteins (neurotrophic factors) that help in regeneration of neurons. Towards testing this therapy we propose the following specific aims:  Specific Aim 1: To perform dose response studies with Sertoli cells. Our current data suggest that Sertoli cells alone had a significant effect on functional recovery and rate of locomotor recovery of spinal cord injured animals. This effect was observed at early time points and plateaued thereafter. One interpretation is that there simply are not enough cells to sustain the effect overtime.  To address that possibility we will inject varying amounts of Sertoli cells into the acutely injured spinal cord. Sertoli cells will be implanted into white matter caudal to the site of injury, within 30 min of the injury, using a stereotaxic device. Lesion development will be monitored by in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The intent is to correlate the temporal profile of lesion progression with locomotor recovery, as defined by a battery of neurologic tests that evaluate coordinated locomotion, hind limb paw position during locomotion, and performance on an inclined grid. To our knowledge this is the first study to use MRI to determine the extent to which lesion progression correlates with neurologic impairment. Animals will be euthanized at 42 days post injury and the spinal cords will be subject to histological assessment of white matter and quantification of NT-3.  Specific Aim 2: To determine if delayed implantation of cells following injury results in improved cell survival and functional recovery. In the above studies we have implanted cells in the acutely traumatized spinal cord. The acutely injured spinal cord is characterized by prominent oxidative injury and pronounced proteolytic activity. Thus, survival of Sertoli cells may be challenged by these adverse conditions. We therefore propose to delay the time of cell implantation to 3 days and 7 days post injury.  These time points coincide with wound healing including angiogenesis, events that may define an environment that is more receptive to implantation of cells.  Lesion development will be monitored by in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and correlated with motor function. Animals will be euthanized at 42 days post injury. The cords will be subjected to immuno- and histochemistry and assessment of NT-3 activity. Emphasis will be on quantifying the extent of residual white matter, glial scar formation, and assessment of the long descending serotonergic fiber tracts. Together, these anatomical and behavioral outcomes will determine the extent to which treatment alters wound healing and promotes plasticity and functional recovery.  Specific Aim 3: To isolate and characterize human Sertoli cells for therapeutic development as delivery agents. Human Sertoli cells will be isolated from tissues, propagated in culture, and carefully characterized with regard to their expression of surface proteins including follicle stimulating hormone receptor (FSHr) and androgen binding protein (ABP). Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT); a marker for Sertoli cells, we be quantified using a standard enzyme assay. Once characterized, cells will be infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing NT-3 and the levels of NT-3 production will be determined by ELISA. Mixed lymphocyte reactions will be performed in the presence of virally infected and uninfected human Sertoli cells, to determine their immunosuppressive ability.",
